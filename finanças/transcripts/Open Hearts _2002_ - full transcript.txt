Open Hearts Would you like a sweet? No. No? Not at all? What's up? Nothing. I just thought maybe you'd like a sweet. Well, I wouldn't. What's that? It's... a ring. But you can only have it if you'll marry me. Are you're sure you're not just drunk? Actually, you're right. I'm as pissed as a newt. Can I have it back? You're right. Sorry. Can I have it back? No. Do you want it? OK. What the heck! "OK, what the heck"?! You've got to say it properly. "Yes". I love you. "But..." I love you and I'd love your hideous ring. You would? I love you. Five people have been killed by an avalanche in France. Everyone on our trip has tried it thousands of times. I just don't see what's so funny about dangling off rock faces. Of course it'll be great for me to be widowed at 25. There are also dangers to being a cook. Yes. Lots. You're always burning your fingers. And what about all those big knives? I worry about those every time you leave for work. "Will she come home in one piece?" Cille baby... nothing will happen. I promise. Nothing will happen. I promise I'll be careful, Cille. Yes. I don't believe it. What? Look! Come on, out you come! Hello! It's an extra prezzie to help you look good while I'm away. The box does open... Wow! Do you like them? No, of course not. The problem is, I've just got to see them on you. You can change them if it's too big. The shop assistant was a man so I couldn't say you were "about his size". It's ridiculous, anyway. A man in the lingerie department. What on earth does he tell his kids? Cille... Let me have a look at you! No! Know what? I don't think they're very nice after all. We'd better take them off. Nice of you to buy me a car. But you borrow it the whole time. You can have it tomorrow. How many times have I driven it? Twice? You can have it tomorrow. Out you get! See you later. Have a good time. I'll sit here for a moment. Goodbye! See you. Damn! Oh, God, no! Can you feel his heart beat? I daren't touch him. Wait a moment. Have you got a mobile phone? Stine? Give me your bag! Does anybody have a mobile phone to call an ambulance with? You didn't bring it? OK. I've got to calm down. I'll go and get a doctor. Does anybody have a mobile phone? When it's my birthday can I have a horse? No. Horses are for girls. You're a boy. You want something motorized. Maybe I'm gay. No, you're not. Not at the age of eight. What if I am? You'll just have to wait to come out of the closet till you're 12. All right? Yes. Good. Will I get a horse then? You'll get a horse. Where are your glasses? In the lounge. Where in the lounge? On a chair. On a chair? Again? Go and get them before somebody sits on them. Do you want a horse? No. Sure? Shall I tickle you a bit? Give me your hand. I need a hand. Here comes the surgeon to cut off your hand... Hi... they've only just paged me. Are you OK? She's just had a fright. Yes. Niels, I have done an Xray. Thanks. Where is Stine? She's OK. She's fine. She wasn't sure she wanted to celebrate this evening. Don't worry. I'll see what we can do. Marie... what happened? I didn't see it. I only heard the bump. It wasn't your fault, Marie. You do know that, don't you? Yes. That's what the police said, too. But I didn't tell them we were going a bit too fast because me and Stine were arguing. That's not why it happened. I only heard him. I didn't see him. You couldn't help it. Will you find out how he is? I'll run you home first. No, I want to know how he is. I'm afraid it's really bad. Really bad. We don't know for sure. But it looks really serious. His girlfriend is sitting in the hall. Yes... er... yes. Hello. Hello. Have you time to talk to me? Just for a moment? Is he dead? No, I'm just... Sorry. I'm not on duty. OK. Clumsy of me. Sorry. My wife was driving the car. Your wife? Yes. OK... So that must have been your daughter? Yes... she'll be all right, too. It's her birthday. We're getting married. You will. You think? Yes. I'm sure of it. We're so terribly sorry this has happened. If there's anything we can do to help... Is there anybody at home? I don't have any parents, and Joachim's live in the USA. Look... That's me, and that's our phone number. Call whenever you feel like it. Can you ask how bad it is? They won't tell me. I don't know anything. That's because they don't know anything yet either. But they would tell me, wouldn't they? If they thought... They would tell me? Yes, definitely. Yes. With lovely hot chocolate and birthday cake... And when she... Happy Birthday, Darling! Did you hear that Torben's walked out on Birthe and their ugly kids? When was that? Beats me why he stayed so long. She looked like Henry Vlll. She even dressed like him. You're talking about our friends. She could have made an effort. A manicure or the occasional bike ride. Is the sauce all gone? I'll get you some more. Are you OK? He just had so much blood in him. Was the car damaged? Finn! It's a fair question. A new car... Are you sure? Yes. What did she say to you? She didn't say anything. She was afraid and upset. She asked how you were and also how mum was. It's a very typical reaction. It's psychological. In crises we look after others. I mean... women do. Give us a break! You could learn from it, Finn. Why don't you go get a tattoo? Don't be silly, Finn! She's right. Niels's dad spent his life working 16 hour shifts. The only time he was with his whole family was at his funeral. You can't accuse Niels of the same thing. He's got seven kids or however many it is, and they stick to him like warts. We've got three, and that was a lovely way of putting it. Three, then. It's just too much. Well, I wouldn't mind trying for another. It doesn't surprise me. Good luck to you! Is there any more sauce? No. Funnily enough, not for you. There's a drop left here, Finn. Thanks. Would you phone to see how he is? Shall I phone now? ...Of course. What did they say? No news. You're sure? Yes. How long will he be in surgery? It could be four or five hours. When will they phone? As soon as they know anything. How about a toast for Stine? Yes! You really don't have to. Of course we do. This is a no smoking area. Sorry. Good morning, Cecilie. Have you had any sleep? No, not really. Have a seat. Coffee? Yes, please. I could give you a long lecture. Just tell me the truth. It's not good. Joachim has broken his neck and his back. Most of his back simply got crushed. What does that mean? It means... He'll be able to talk and think. But that's all. Does he know? Not yet. Hi. Hi. Hi, Baby. It's blown my trip to Pelagonia. Yes... Patagonia... Yes. I can't feel my arms or legs. It feels really weird. It's not a good sign, is it? You'll never feel anything again from the neck down. Oh... but... I know it sounds harsh, but you'll never be able to walk again. I'd like to be left alone for a bit. We've got several psychologists... Please go now. I'll leave the two of you. I'm sorry. Cecilie... please go. Joachim... I really mean it. I want you to go now. Joachim... No, none of that. I can't be bothered with it, OK? Damn it... all right? See you. Joachim... Cecilie, stop it. Go now, damn it. I love you. Please go. Stop that. STOP IT! Get out! Yes, we could do that, too. Or send him flowers or chocolates. But it won't help him. Can't he have sex any more, either? Stine! It's pretty important. To some people, anyway. No, he can't have sex either. Maybe I could write to him. All right. But it won't help him right now, or make it easier. Marie, he stepped out in front of your car. You couldn't help it. No. It wasn't your fault. Marie, it wasn't! Things like that happen. Every single day. And life goes on. Yes, for us. But not for him. Just think of his girlfriend! It wasn't your fault. You know that, don't you? Tell me if there's anything you want me to bring you from home. Loads of people have phoned to ask if they can come and see you. Are you thirsty? You're going to have to let me in on this. You're going to have to let me help you. I love you. Forever. Hello. Hi. It's really nice of you to spare me the time. Of course I do. How is he? Well... He won't talk to me. I know he talks to the nurses. But when I come he just lies there without saying anything. And what do you do? They say it's normal. And that it'll pass. It is very normal. And it will pass. I just don't get it. There must be ways... They can do all kinds of things. There must be something. I wish I could be more encouraging. But there isn't even a theoretical chance. He only has a year left before he gets his M. Sc. We were going to get married. What is he studying? Geography. I'm a cook. Or... Would you like an apple? You've got apples? A little bag. For our blood sugar. For our blood sugar? Here. Thanks. Has he dumped her or what? I don't know. Her best friend has slept with her boyfriend. Poor Stine! As if she didn't have enough problems as it was! I'm lost. What problems? What's going on? She's not doing well at high school. Or turning up for work at the library. And I think she's started stealing. Money keeps vanishing from my purse. Maybe she needs more pocket money. You're such an easy touch! She's probably upset in general, don't you think? Maybe it's affected her more than she admits? What do you mean? She knows she made you speed up. Do you think that's what she thinks? I don't know what to say. Maybe it's her age. Remember what it was like? I was never that age. No, you weren't. Shall we just sell her and make a new one? No, we can't. You have to have sex for that. I don't know if you've ever heard of it. Sex. You mean we both have to have it? Yes. My goodness... What was that? I think it was a kiss. You don't usually kiss me like that. Yes, I do... "An idea to be regarded in the light of his new confidence in himself following the incident in the quarry eighteen months ago." "Professor, it can't be that significant that the monument was based on frost?" Will you please shut up? I didn't think you could talk any more. Why are you doing this? Why? Why do you insist on humiliating me like this? Why do you make such a fuss? I think you should beat it. I promise we'll work things out. In about two years' time my legs will start to wither. They won't. My arms will dangle like two lengths of boiled spaghetti. At some stage they'll have to amputate the whole bloody lot. All you'll have left will be the dead bit of skin that was once my dick. Stop it! Think about it. I'm telling you the way it is. You want to live with that? Yes, of course I do. In that case I think we should get married at once. You'll be able to spend your wedding night wiping my arse. Do stop it! Cecilie... Please go. I mean it. In all sincerity. I can't. I can't just go. I love you, damn it. If I love you enough you'll love yourself one day. Listen to you! Shut your face! You've got to stop listening to all those pop lyrics. Come here... If you love me as much as you keep bragging about you should walk away. You'll do us both a favour. Stop coming here. It's dumb. Get a life. Yes. Right? See you around. It doesn't have to be like this. You're just making everything worse. It can't be worse. It can! Please just go. Now. Cecilie... I am on my way. But I'll be back. You will not come again. Why take it out on Cecilie? She hasn't done anything. It'd be a fucking good idea if you shut your arsehole and turn on the TV. By then we'd been through the repertoire several times. She was jumping up and down on top of me. And I had to tell her "I just can't do it any more, Honey". Hello? Hi. This is Cecilie. I'm at the hospital. I was wondering if you had five minutes? Who was that? That Cecilie girl. She wants another chat. I'd be happy to... Finn, eat your mackerel. And she said "I've got to have an orgasm too or I'll get a headache". OK., And you said... "Take some aspirin!" Then I drove home and watched Bridge over the River Kwai. Bloody good film, by the way. Finn, eat your mackerel. See you in a moment. Hi. Hi. Were you nodding off to sleep? I was admiring the weather. Breakfast is the most important meal of the day. I never have breakfast. Oh, right, you're a cook. After all, I don't start my day by... No, I don't suppose you do! Look... I used to live... ...just over there. In Randers St. When you were a medical student? No, as a boy. It was my childhood home. We used to climb over... ...there used to be a fence. But you don't want to hear all this. I do! Oh, OK. Niels! Niels! I thought I saw you. Hi, Robert, hi Sanne. This is Cecilie. Robert and Sanne. Hello... So this is where you two hang out. No, Cecilie is... She was in the car. When Marie and Stine... And Robert sells combine harvesters. We were airing the twins. Yes, it's good to get away from the white walls once in a while. What was all that about? That was Sanne and Robert. Robert is Marie's brother and he's in combine harvesters. So you said... but what came over you? I just got confused. I forgot why we were out here. And then they showed up. I'm sorry. It wasn't very... That's all right. It's OK. We can take a short cut. Cecilie? Come in. He doesn't want to see you today. Come off it! He says things... He is within his rights. He doesn't want to see you. Maybe. But I have to see him. Joachim? I don't believe it. We've got to... You are a fool. Calm down! I told you to stay away. I asked you to leave. Yes, but... Didn't I ask you to stay away? Calm down. I asked you to go. Calm down... Which book? You choose. Is it for me? Yes. I'll put you to bed. Good night, Daddy. Daddy'll come in a moment. Niels speaking. This is Cecilie. Hi. How are you? It's Joachim. I know he's going through hell but he needn't be such a bastard. I'm just as unhappy as he is. But he doesn't care. It's as if it's all... ...my fault. Listen... calm down. It isn't your fault. Do you hear me? Shall I come over? Yes. Right. Mummy! Gustav took my Cocoa Pops! Give them back, Gustav. Get a move on! Stine? How much is 20 plus 20? Forty. Size forty for a bum is plenty. Gustav! Was that you coming in so late? Yes, it was me. Where were you? At work. Why were you up? Why weren't you asleep? I couldn't sleep. Were you with the mishap girl? Her name is Cecilie. What do you do when you're together? We talk. OK. That's nice. You don't think it's odd? No, I don't. What are you trying to tell me? She's miserable and I talk to her. The way I talk to all my patients. Hurry up, Gustav. We've got to go. It may take me ages to finish. Be quiet and eat up, all right? Does she like talking to you? You're asking for it! You go on and on. What are you playing at? She's lost her boyfriend. You know how that feels, right? That wasn't too good. No. She'd only just stopped crying over him. It was wrong of me, OK? But don't you agree she was insolent? It was nothing compared to what she called me yesterday. I am just tired. I've been at work. What did she call you? An East German dyke. I was proud of her. They're doing the Cold War at school now. Stine will have to pay for that plate, won't she? Joachim? Remember this? Do you? Joachim, please look at me. You're not going to smash me like this. You're not. Look at me, Joachim! Was that it? Was that all we had together? Joachim, look at me, damn you! My whole life also disappeared that morning. With you. Please won't you come back to me? Won't you speak to me? Cecilie... come along. Is there anything I can do? Is there anything you want? Beat it. Yes? Hello? Cecilie? Is something up? Will you come over and hold me? Yes. Of course. Was that Cecilie? Yes. What did she want? She's upset, I think... Should we do something? I think she just wants to talk to someone. She's at the hospital. She asked if I'd come over. Can't you? She's at the hospital all on her own. All right. I love you. Hi. Right, what's happened? What's happened, Cecilie? Nothing. We're just going to stand here for a moment. Yes. Cecilie, has something happened? No. We're just going to stand here a moment. I'll take the boys to school. Stine doesn't start till 10. OK... have a nice day. What's up? Showers suit you. Yes. Shall we go to Norway at Christmas? Gustav and Emil could try skiing. Yes... but drive Stine to school first, all right? Have a nice day. Good morning, Darling. Got out of bed on the wrong side? Something to do with Rolf? Rolf is a jerk. His breath smells. In that case what's up? Why would you care? You're always with the mishap girl. Stine, do you mind? Are you seeing her? Just stop it. If you go on attacking everyone with all your crap your life will be very difficult. She's living at the hospital? Mum feels the same way. Be nice to her. She's losing patience with you. Right. Eat up and I'll drive you to school. But how long will he go on feeling bitter? It varies. Some people take years. Others take months. Some never get over it. They die bitter and lonely. Nobody can help them. You can't help him. He's the only one who can. The only way you can help him is by getting on with your own life. But he's doing it for my sake. No, he isn't. He is only thinking of himself. He's so sorry for himself that it's the only thing that matters. It's hard. But you must move on. It's fine that you've met somebody else. No need to feel guilty. No, but it isn't for real. He's married and stuff. Oh, so you can't fall in love with him? I don't know. I just want to talk to Joachim. From Joachim Peterson Hi. Don't come after all. I... I haven't done the shopping, anyway. I want to be alone. 'Bye. Hi... Pizza delivery. Two pizzas for Cecilie Pagh. Come in. Is it OK? Yes, come on in. Wow! You've certainly rearranged the place. Yes. It's cosy, don't you think? What have you done with the furniture? Joachim took it. He needed it for something. Maybe he thought it was his. It may also be a way of trying to tell me that there won't be a wedding. I don't know. Maybe there'll be a wedding anyway. You never know. Are you OK? I'm fed up with talking about him. I talk of nothing but him. But do sit down... You don't think I should go? No, stay. Sit down. Right. I'll sit over here. Here. Have you cheated on Marie often? OK... No, I must admit I haven't. Why do you ask? Have you ever? No. Before, I mean? Before what? Before this. No. Not at all? No, I haven't. Never ever? Never ever. This is the first time. Is there anything wrong with that? No. Hi. Hi. What are you doing? Nothing. Just walking. Listen. I've been thinking. It's no good your not having any furniture. You must let me buy you a sofa. May I buy you a sofa? Wow! So that's leather. It's leather. Is it comfy? Yes. It really supports your back. Yes, it does. It's an incredibly lovely sofa. We sell lots of them. But it's very dark. Haven't you a lighter model? Not this one. We have other sofas that are lighter. But this one is incredibly practical. You wipe it with a damp cloth. And if it tears you can patch it with your trousers. We'll take it. I saw something over here, too. Do you only have one of these? No, we've lots. We'll take two of them. Two of them. And... We'd like to look at a bed. In that case you'll have to move down the bus, please. Straight ahead and turn left by the stairs. Then sharp left again. I'll be with you in a moment. Sharp... left. It was brown. Aren't you coming up? Yes. It's very clever. If we have a row we won't have to turn our backs on each other. I see you've found the mattresses. They're incredibly lovely mattresses. Elevating mattresses. I was wondering what the benefits of this position are. It's incredibly comfortable if you like watching TV or reading in bed. Lots of people do. Yes, I can tell. It's actually a pleasant position. Are there any that don't move like this? Of course. But then it'll just be an ordinary mattress. Obviously. But can't you get the same quality? Yes, but as I say, it wouldn't be an elevating mattress. Is there a difference between these two? In addition to price, this one is an incredibly good mattress. You get a lot of mattress for your money. It's the Ferrari of mattresses. Oh, is it? In that case we'll take two. And two mattress mats. Oh, goodbye! I think that'll do it. I think we've a couple of bookcases left for our other customers. Down I go... You're mad. I'll pay for it all. No, you won't. It's just furniture. If you win the lottery you can give me some money. There may be a couple of day's delivery time. That's all right. I think we'll just stay here. Oh, no, no, no! Stop it! Hanne! Hanne? Damn it! Look at this! Hanne! Did you call? No. Look! It keeps turning the pages back. It's very clever. I can't read backwards, you jerk. Give Mikkel a call. I'll have to wait till tomorrow. No, I've got to have another machine. It's the 9th time. We'll have to ask one of the technicians tomorrow. Yes, let's tell one of the technicians tomorrow. Would you like some water? No. I don't want any water. Funny you should mention water. Why? Because I heard a little story about your son Michael. Who told you about Michael? I don't quite remember... Who told you about Michael? Someone in a white coat? If you ever mention Michael's name I'll... You'll what? You'll what? Just tell me! Come on, Hanne, my lass, come on! You'll what? Just never mention Michael's name. Get the message? Never! Oh, I didn't mean to... To what? I'm only asking because... Because what? Death by drowning, right? It's meant to be... ...as far as I've heard... one of the very, very worst... No, I don't think so. Do you know what the very, very worst is? No? It's being a selfcentred little bastard lying in a hospital bed, pitiful and helpless while his girlfriend is in love with another man. That's the very, very worst thing. Get the message? I'm sorry. It's not true. She phones every single day. Hi! Hi, Finn. By the way, I saw that Cecilie girl. Oh? OK? She's a looker. Are you shafting her? Finn, her boyfriend is in room 3092 and he's a quadriplegic. Yes, but are you shafting her? That's right, just ask me directly. Well, Somebody is. It shows. That's good. It's what she needs. I just didn't know you had it in you. It's great to see. Is it? Well, you are a warm, very likeable person, Finn. Just don't screw up. It's not serious, is it? Will you just shut up? What a mess, eh? How old are Gustav and Emil? Six and eight. Does Marie know? No. Funnily enough she thinks Gustav is in his mid thirties. Jeeze! Have you told her? No, I have not. Wait. It may blow over. If so, that'll just be that. But it's a toughie, specially if all she wants is a bit of consolation. Would you look at this? I'd like your opinion. What is it? A sick man. That's why we're here. Why not turn it up a bit? Look, Mum, a Mercedes van. Lovely. Really lovely. It's much better than a horse. Yes. What have you drawn? A skeleton. Will you help me colour it? Ask dad, will you? I'm reading. Stine, why not bash a few saucepans? Stine... I'm going to the supermarket. What for? Can we come? To do the shopping. We've done the shopping. We need some... Yes, you can. Dad, can we have a swimming pool? No. All you need is a JCB to dig the hole. We're not having a pool. I thought you wanted a boat? I do. What about that PlayStation? Emil, come here! You can't have everything you want. Why not? One just can't. One has to choose. I choose the pool and the Mercedes. You'll have to save up for them. No. Dad, can we have one of these? What is it? It's a plunger. No. Can we have a bag of these? That's the last thing for now. That's the last thing. No more now. Hey, stop it! Cecilie speaking. Hi. How are you? Hi! I'm fine. How are you? I'm pushing a trolley round a supermarket where all I can think about is you. I can see why. How boring! OK! Listen... What I'm trying to tell you is that... yes. I'm afraid I've really fallen in love with you. Are you still there? Yes. Dad, can we have these? Not now. No more. Calm down! There's a special offer on those. Thanks. I just really want to see you. Yes. Hey! Hey! No mobiles. They screw up the card reader. I'll only be a second. Turn it off right now. Just a second. Now! May I finish? Turn it off. Thanks. I'm back. Can't I phone you later? Yes, all right. 'Bye. That will do! OK? Both of you! What have you bought?! There are winegums, too. It's for the weekend. Baby food?! It's my jam. Did you buy that? Honestly, what is all this junk? We chose anything we wanted. Dad was on the phone. Who to? Shall we have the chocolate? To Finn. Here... Stine, too. Go upstairs. Who to? Finn. He's a bit down. Don't lie to me. I'm not a fool. You say I'm lying to you? You just stare into space... I know you weren't talking to Finn. You're saying I'm lying? Don't you think I was talking to Finn? Shall I phone him? Who were you talking to? Where's the phone? Do you want to ask him? Was it Cecilie? We'll phone him. Was it Cecilie? Are you having an affair with her? You don't mean what you're saying, do you? Do you mean what you're saying? Shall I tell you something? You were the one who asked me to help her. Agreed? You're the one who told me to get up in the middle of the night to go and help Cecilie. OK? It wasn't my idea, was it? I'd really like not to have the trouble. You go and talk to her. You help her. Shall we do it that way? How old is she? 22? 23? She looks younger than some of Stine's friends. Don't look away. Don't tell me I've got time for an affair. You're the one who wanted me to help her. It's for your sake. I didn't ask for this. I just think you're being strange. Am I being strange? Is it strange that I'm tired? You're not your usual self. No. I'm tired because I work all the time. And I'm sorry if I stare into space. When the hell did you get so jealous? It's just that I... I just think... I just think you're acting a bit strangely. I'm not acting strangely. I'm tired, damn it! I'm always at work. Is it strange? Give me a break! Is it strange? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry if I'm not all there. I'm tired, tired, tired. That's all there is to say. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. OK... Is there something wrong with you? Did the boys give you any sweets? No. Really? I think I'll have a word with them. What's up? What? What's up? Nothing. Right. Hi. Hi... will you kids get that? Hi. Cecilie keeps phoning. Oh, OK. She sounds a bit... Did you talk to her? Not really. Won't you give her a call? Yes, after supper. Dad? A lady for you. She knows my name is Emil. Why don't you answer your mobile? The battery's flat. Your little boy is sweet. The furniture's arrived. Get some sleep and phone me at work tomorrow. Is your wife there? Precisely. I'll phone you tomorrow, then. Yes. At work. 'Bye. She says hello. Thanks. Was she OK? I was wondering... perhaps we should ask her for supper? This evening, maybe? Not this evening. Isn't it OK just to be ourselves this evening? Sure. Do you want rice or potatoes? Goodnight. Goodnight. Neurosurgery, Hanne speaking. Hanne speaking. This is Cecilie. I just wanted to hear how Joachim was or if he'd said anything. There's no change, Cecilie. There. That's it. Now all we need is our bed. You don't think we should cool it a bit? What do you mean, "cool it"? Just what I said. Cool it. I'm sorry I've kept phoning. It's not that. That's OK. It was silly of me. It's not that. I just can't figure out... I just can't figure out what we're doing. I can't. What the hell are you at? Stine? What the hell are you doing? What are you doing here? I know everything. You're having it off with her. You bastard. Stine, listen... Does she like the furniture? What? You won't even buy me a dress. Listen... Stop it! You've had a dress. That's not the point. Let go of me! Stop it! Stine, come back! Stine! Stine! Stine! Thanks for trying to help, Anja. I'll tell her to phone if I hear from her. Thanks. 'Bye. 'Bye. Well? I can't find her. She's really for it now. Easy does it. Something must have happened to her. It's 10.30. Nothing's happened to her. ...Nothing's happened to her. Just stay away from my dad. You little tart! You were wearing that jacket the day Joachim got run over. But your hair was different. It was my fault. What? I told mum to go faster. It was my fault. It wasn't your fault, Stine. Yes, it was. I'm sorry. No, it was an accident. Want to come in? No. Just stay away from us. Find another family to destroy. OK. I'm going inside. I'm cold. He's just screwing you. He isn't crazy about you at all. Have you got a boyfriend? None of your business. In that case it's hard to explain. What the hell do you mean? I've had loads of boyfriends. I've got one now. Oh. I thought he'd dumped you? Did he tell you that? Yes. Don't interfere with my life. Or my dad's. No. I know you know your dad loves you and your brothers much, much more than he'll ever care for me. Can't you just find somebody else? Stine... Marie speaking. Hello. This is Cecilie. I just wanted to say that Stine is at my place. Oh? She's all right. I just wanted to let you know. OK. Fine. We'll pick her up right away. 'Bye. And thanks. She's at Cecilie's. Why is she at Cecilie's? Probably because I was at Cecilie's today. OK... Stine followed me. She got upset and ran off because I bought Cecilie some furniture. You bought some furniture for her? Yes. Why did you buy ...What's going on? Sorry. How many times have you been to her flat? I don't know. Six times? Seven, perhaps? Marie... Marie? No, no, no... What about her boyfriend? Does he know you've been visiting her? Are you out of your mind? How long have you been lying to me? I didn't mean this to happen. Does Stine know? Yes, she does. Apparently. Is that the kind of team we are now? I run over the boyfriend and you fuck what's left? Is that it? Stop it. Me, stop it? Fuck her all you like but keep her away from my kids. But when you've finished fucking her please come home again because otherwise a lot of people will get very upset. If she so much as gets close to my children I'll kill her. Get the message? Where are you going? ...Where are you going? I'm going to get my daughter. Stine. Remember her? Where does Cecilie live? I'll get her. Tell me her address. I'd be happy to go. I don't think you should. Just tell me where she lives. Why? I'd be happy to... Where does she live? Where does she live... 16, Fish Pond Street. 3rd floor. You know her address by heart! You fool! Right... I'd better go down on my own. Hi, Stine. Wait in the car. Go on. I'll be right with you. Well... thank you. No trouble. I can see why you're upset. I can. I can also see why you need somebody to comfort you. But you mustn't destroy our family. It's not like that. Far too many people will get upset. Do you see? Far too many people will get really upset. Do you understand me? Yes. So stay away. Stay away. And by the way... We can't afford all that furniture. Was dad angry? Dad wasn't angry. Dad is just a huge idiot. Hello, Princess. Hi. Are you hungry? No. Sure? Yes. I'm sorry. No. You're not the one to say sorry. I am. Stine... I'm sorry, Stine. She's nice. Are you going to leave us? You are. I'm in love with her. No, you're not. You're not. What about her boyfriend? I can't help it. I think about her all the time. What can't you help? She's 23. Not much older than the shirt you're wearing. She's confused you, that's all. It's because you're confused. Maybe. I can't... I'm sorry. I'm going to have to go. Please won't you stay? I can't bear it here. I can't bear lying to you all the time. Do you love her? I suppose I do. No, you don't. I'll have to go. Please stay. Please. I love you. Please! I know. I can't. What about the children? What when you're not here? Stop it. Don't start. You won't see what they do. Stop it! What about Stine? Stop it! I think about it all the time. I love you, Niels. Please won't you stay? I can't. I can't stay here. My head is spinning. Please won't you stay? Mummy? What? When are we going to eat? Ask your father. He's leaving us. I didn't mean it, Niels. I know. I just can't. It's no good. It's no good. I'm sorry. Marie, listen... let go of me. I'm sorry. It'll be over in a moment. I'll pull myself together, OK? Lt'll be better in a moment. I've left them. So... She's stopped coming, hasn't she? You refuse to see her. Doesn't she phone any more either? She phones every single day. Every single day? I dreamed she had somebody else. I don't think so. You know fuck all about that. No, you're right. I don't. God, you're ugly. Yes. I have not been fortunate. Can't one of the surgeons fucking you remove the bags under your eyes? I don't know. They probably can't be bothered. Let me ask you straight out... Do they sign a list to shoot their wads up your cunt? I don't think we know each other well enough for me to answer. Eh? Let me give you some advice. You can take it or leave it. Take whatever you can get. Of what? Men. Do you need some fresh air? What do you mean? How about a short walk? When we've had lunch? Just a short one. Here... Cecilie here. I can't come to the phone right now... This is Hans Thomsen, Rigshospitalet. Joachim asked me to phone you to ask if you'd come and see him. Perhaps you could phone me. Goodbye. Shall I give you a lift? No. I think I'll just walk. 'Byebye. 'Bye. Joachim? Hi. Hi. I... have missed you. I... am sorry I... That's OK. Will you help me? Yes. Always. I'm driving. Give me a push. Hi, guys! Hi, Dad! How's things? Fine. Happy Birthday! Is it for me? Yes. And a bit for you. It's really heavy. What is it? A Mercedes horse with a swimming pool on top. It can't be. Mercedes aren't this small. Open it, then! Let's see what it is! Open it! I am. Hi. Hi. How is everything? The last of your stuff is in the hall. Good. What stuff? A few shirts and books. You've got cream right here. Oh, OK. Thanks. Was it a horse? What was it? Look, Mum! Dad's given me a PlayStation! Wow! You lucky boy! It's brilliant. Shall we see what it's like? Yes. What do we do? Need any help? Stick a few flags into the cake. I'm not the best in the world at this. We need mum to help us. No, I want to try. Are you living at work? When will Uncle Finn be here? Uncle Finn is not your uncle. And why isn't he coming? He's at work. But he says Happy Birthday and that being eight is cool. But it means no present. Sanne and Robert will have one. How is Cecilie? Fine. Are you going to live together? Stine! It isn't a secret, is it? You don't want to talk about it? No. Stop it. Gustav! Have fun! Goodbye. Take care, you little devil. See you! Yes. Have a great birthday, Gustav. Gustav! Can't you stay? We're having pork. I have to go to work. But I'll come and see you in five days' time. OK? Give me a kiss! 'Bye. Thanks for the cake. Thank you. Take care now... all right? It's not pretty but it's clean. Thanks. Do you want a TV down here? No, thanks. I'm fine. Fancy getting drunk? No. I'll give it a miss. I need some sleep. Cheer up. Marie will have you back. It'll take three months. It always did with Mille. They just need a while to flex their biceps. Give me a break. You don't know what it's about. Do you? Maybe it's not about getting Marie back? In that case it might take longer. It probably will. Goodnight. Goodnight. Thanks for the sheets. Careful. All right, all right! Bloody hell! Be careful! Hold on tight. There. Taste this one. We'll have to build a ramp. Nice? Is there anything else you'd like? Yes, Tommy. Tell you what... Do you think you could help me to have a pee? Because Cecilie can't go into the gents'. I was joking. Tommy! Relax! Bloody hell! You had me there. But call me if needs be. I'll be right with you. Yes, what the hell am I doing here? You are very beautiful. But I really want to tell you that it is OK... ...that you don't want to be with me. It's fine. It's perfectly all right if it's because you don't love me. It is not all right... ...if it's because you're confused as hell. Because if so I'll go mad. But... I don't know what you want with me. What do you want with me? What do you want with me? Eh? You don't know. Because you are spoilt as hell. You are so bloody spoilt. You said "Come here, I want you". "Lovely. Take him!" Then you changed your mind. I love you. That's what I came up the stairs to say. Right. Now I've said it. Niels, please... What do you want? What? To kiss? To hold me, even? I've been missing you, too. I have. I've been missing you. What are you thinking about? Hey! Why aren't you asleep? I thought you were tired. What were you thinking? I was wondering whether we should go to the theatre tonight. We could have supper somewhere first and then find a play we both want to see. Cecilie... What is it? I never go to the theatre. It bores me to death. I'm not the one you ought to take. You are. No. Yes. I don't want to go. All I ask is for you to come and see me now and then. And to help me a little. Specially to begin with. As time goes by more and more time will pass between visits. But by then I'll be much better at coping. You mustn't cry, all right? No. I'm not crying. We were just unlucky. That's no reason for you to suffer. Sweet, widefingered Cecilie... See you. See you, all right? Let's say so, eh? Yes. That's the best way. 'Bye. 'Bye. Take care. Same to you. Yes? Hi. Hi. I've left Joachim. Or we've left each other. What now? I don't know. But I'll work it out. May I phone you? Yes, you may. See you. Yes. Maybe. Cecilie? I want you to know that had I known all this would happen I'd have done it anyway. Shall I sit with you for a bit? Yes.
