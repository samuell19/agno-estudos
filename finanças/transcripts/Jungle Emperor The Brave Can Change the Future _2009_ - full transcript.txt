(calming violin music) - Commemorating the 80th year since Tezuka Osamu's birth. (calming violin music) Ah! (Leo sniffs) Mm, smells good! (bee buzzes) (Leo yells) Oh, look! - Huh? A lion! It's going to eat me! (screaming) I'm toast! Huh? - I hope the wound on your leg heals quickly. - Oh, okay. Thanks. - That was very kind, but it's not how the jungle works. It's time you started acting like the son of Panja, the Jungle Emperor. (coughing) - Be careful, Old Dolf! You're very sick. - I'm not so old that I need you to worry about me. - Really? - Here you are, Leo. - Oh, what's wrong, Coco? - You're late! Your father's been looking all over for you! - Oh, I forgot! I have hunting training! Take care Old Dolf, see you later! - [Old Dolf] All right. (Leo yells) - Quit messing around! (lighthearted music) - Father! Wait up! - You have to run faster, Leo! Or the prey will get away! - No, the Jungle Emperor! - If you don't catch him, you can forget about dinner. - What? Okay, I won't let him get away! - Oh, it's just the cub. I'd never be able to outrun the Jungle Emperor himself. - Leo, you're getting close! (panicked yells) (water splashes) (laughing) - Are you sure you're the Jungle Emperor's son? (laughing) - Oh, not again! - Everybody's right! Leo is completely hopeless! - Leo, you're going to have to learn to jump over those big openings. - I know. I know, but... I'm scared of heights! (Leo crying) (dramatic music) (sobbing) (intense music) Jungle Emperor: The Brave Changes The Future. - The jungle is dead, we've killed it. The jungle that we respected and held in awe has been destroyed. It is gone forever. And we are the ones who are responsible for this. So now we must bring the jungle back to life! We at Eternal Earth have the answer. This is our creation. The Neo-Jungle! (waves crashing) Our future as a species is in the undiscovered wilderness of the jungle. The infinite potential of our future lies here, in our Neo-Jungle! (clapping) - Wow! My dad is the bravest man alive! Huh? - How big is it? What's the energy source? - Is the population controlled? - Not so fast, everyone. We're getting a bit ahead of ourselves. (chuckling) - I'd like to introduce our project manager. Dr. Halloway will be able to answer all of your questions. - Thank you very much, Mr. O'Donnell. International guests, science has surpassed nature. I know you have a lot of questions about the Neo-Jungle, so please let me explain. (laughing) Our technology has made it possible to build a large platform in the ocean. The Neo-Jungle is almost 85,000 square kilometers, and its primary source of energy is derived from a volcanic sterling engine. The land may be artificial, but the animals residing on it are very real. (people gasping) As you know, nature is very fragile. The conditions must be monitored and controlled. Everything about the ecological cycle had to be replicated exactly, and we needed reliable land, air, and sea transportation. We have underground passages and a subway system. We use the subway system to transport animals around the island. Most of the animals we have here in the Neo-Jungle are of African origin. - Subway? - Hm? - The first inception of the Neo-Jungle was 10 years ago. It's now complete and ready for you to experience. Any issues we had have been resolved. - We might destroy nature, but it has been rebuilt. Man not only has the power to control nature, but to create it from nothing! (clapping) (chuckling) If Neo-Jungles were all over the globe, we'd finally have ecologically sound environment. With your cooperation and approval from the United Nations, we can make this dream come true. We can make this a reality. I thank you in advance for your generous support. Thank you. (clapping) - Huh. This is all just about money and fame. This is a publicity stunt by that scheming CEO, O'Donnell. Huh? Oh! - Don't you dare talk about my dad like that! - Are you Mr. O'Donnell's son? - My apologies. You weren't sent from the UN to argue with a child. Was there any other information that you needed from us? - Yes. Well, I'd like to know more about the power supply and ecosystem. - Daddy! (laughing) - Ugh, not now, Kevin. And please, put your shoe back on. Please excuse him, everyone. (laughing) - Whoa! A white lion! That's so cool! (lion roars) - Typically, you don't see the male lions actively hunting. But through the video feed, we can see he is teaching his cub to hunt. This is an example of how the animal's behavior has changed over time. - That's the one that gave us trouble 10 years ago. - Huh, he's finally been tamed. - Hah. He's the perfect mascot for the Neo-Jungle. - Ouch! (laughing) - He said ouch! (laughing) - Not again. Looks like my son understands the animal's language. He'll make a good interpreter. (laughing) - Come on, Kevin. Aren't you too old for make believe? - No! That's what the lion said. (lighthearted music) - Okay, Leo. Are you ready to show me what you can do? - I sure am! - Oh look, it's the cowardly lion! Catch me if you can! (groaning) - Oh, I can get him! - Oh no! (lighthearted music) Huh? - Leo? Why on Earth did you stop? - I can't! - [Coco] Quickly, or he'll get away! Come on, jump! - I... I can't. I can't jump. I can't jump over a cliff this high. - Oh. So does that mean that- - That's right! Little baby Leo is afraid of heights. - He's so scared he won't even try. - Yeah, that's right! - That sucks! - It stinks! - Why must you all make fun of Leo? Stop it! (laughing) - What do you expect from us? Leo is completely hopeless! - You are wrong! He's not completely hopeless. - Aw, how cute. She's protecting her sweetheart. (gasps) - You don't know what you're talking about, it's not what you think! Leo, jump! - I, I... (lighthearted music) - No way, no way. He's a coward, just like his father! - A coward like his father who's more worried about pleasing the humans than about the jungle! - Panja's a coward, Leo's a coward, a whole family of cowards! - My father is not a coward! - Prove it! Go on, jump! - I will! - You will? - Yeah, Leo! Bring it! - I'm the son of the Jungle Emperor! I am Leo! - Leo, are you okay? - Sorry. I don't think I can do it. - That sucks! - It stinks! (laughing) ♪ Leo's a son of a coward! ♪ ♪ And he's one too! ♪ (laughing) - My father is not a coward! He's not a coward. - Leo, don't cry now. - But... I... (laughing) - Look, Leo's crying again! (laughing) Here goes Panja! - Huh? - [Monkey] He's on patrol duty again! - [Monkey] Serving mankind, as usual! - [All] That's right! (laughing) (intense music) - Father, please! Can't you quit the patrol? Everybody is saying that you're a servant to the humans. They're saying that you're a coward. Oh, Father, don't you know that everybody in the jungle looks down on you? They're saying you aren't the Jungle Emperor anymore! - Let them say what they want. - But Father... (dramatic music) - [Assistant] The rep said that the UN will make a decision on the project next week. - Yes. And that's why we need to run through some tests. - [Assistant] This one seems to have quite a bit more body fat than average. - [Halloway] Okay, let's start with him. (lighthearted music) - Mm, oh, mm! It's so delicious, I can't stop myself! Just one more bite. (groaning) You win, I'll stop eating. (lighthearted music) (machines clicking) (groaning) - Can't you see that we're running here? (hippo yawning) - This is heaven. There's nothing like taking a little... Hey, what's going on? I wonder what it was I did wrong. Another one? - Uh, what's the delay? I need you to bring him in for testing. - [Man] There's another animal in the grid. (gasps) - We have a problem, Dr. Halloway. The animal on the radar is Toto. - Toto? - [Man] Look at the screen! - It's Toto! Abort the mission and get out of there! - [Man] It's coming this way! (screaming) Somebody, help! (screaming) (missile dart firing) - What did you think of the presentation last night? - It was phenomenal. (missile darts firing) A UN representative remained behind. Why is he still here? - [O'Donnell] He's finishing his report for the UN. He's a bit of an odd man but if his report is favorable, our project will certainly get the go ahead from the UN. Then Eternal Earth will be able to monopolize the new eco business. Our endorsements will easily exceed the national budget. Bullseye. (missile dart firing) And then I will be known as the creator of nature and save the entire Earth. - Wow! I knew dad was a genius. Only a genius could do all this! (chuckling) Where's that little white lion cub I saw yesterday? (gorilla belching) - Ah! Life is so boring! - The old jungle and savanna were so much better than this! - Oh, what's the point of harping about the old days? - It's just that I can't stand being watched all the time. - Ah, at least we get plenty to eat and drink here. - Yeah, I guess that's true. - What are they talking about? - [Halloway] Kevin. - Oh, Dr. Halloway. The animals are saying funny things. - Kevin, you know that the animals can't talk, and you shouldn't be here. You know this area's off limits. - But I really can understand the animals! I know what they're saying! - Please, Kevin. I don't have any time to play make believe right now. I need you to go back to your quarters and stay there please. Thank you. (Kevin yells) - Why doesn't anyone want to listen to me? Here we are in this incredible place, and I have to stay in my room? How boring! - But I thought Toto was supposed to be dead. - I'm positive. Without doubt, it was Toto. - Mr. O'Donnell. If the UN representative finds out about Toto, it'll jeopardize the entire project. - I know. - You can't hurt him, he's a rare species. - That's too bad. Which is more crucial to humankind's future? Nature or a single animal? Eliminate Toto. - Okay. I think I remember the code number that unlocks this door. (beeping) Huh? - Today your target is the black panther. The boss wants it dead. Hunt it down and you'll make him very happy. - [All] Yes, sir! (tense music) (buzzer rings) - [Man] This is a piece of cake. - [Man] How awesome is it that we get a big bonus for killing an animal? Here we come, Toto. - [Man] Find it, shoot it, and get rich quick. (laughing) (car rumbling) (Kevin groans) (lighthearted music) (Kevin gasps) - [Kevin] Amazing! The new jungle is beautiful! Ew, it stinks! That must be the animals. (laughing) Wah! Huh? (lighthearted music) (flamingos squawking) (Kevin groans) (waves crashing) - Isn't this where the panther was last spotted? It must be hiding. - Yeah. They're looking for it on the monitors right now. - Well... This is a safari. We might as well have a little fun. - Easy does it. We're only after one animal, that's all. - [Man] Sure thing. (laughing) - [Animal] Humans, watch out, hide! Ah, not again! - [Animal] I hate people! - [Animal] Oh, how I miss the old jungle. - [Animal] You old timers all say that. - [Animal] Well, I suppose you like taking orders from humans. - What? Don't they like it here? Don't they realize how great it is? Oh no, gross! I stepped in poo! (snake hisses) (Kevin yells) (groaning) (whimsical music) Wow! Huh? (whimsical music) (chuckling) I know! He'll love it! I'm gonna take your photo for my dad! (monkeys screeching) You're too quick! (lighthearted music) - [Coco] Leo, you can do it! Jump to where I am! You can do it! - [Leo] Yeah! I won't be called a coward again! - That's right! You can do it, Leo! (Leo grunts) (whimsical music) Huh? Don't you go backwards! What on Earth are you doing? - Oh, I- - [All] Coward, coward! - You can try all you want... - [Both] But it's a waste of time! - Just quit! You're never gonna figure it out anyway! - He's just a coward! - Keep your mouth shut, I am not a coward! - Why don't you go ahead and jump then? - I'm going to! (monkey teasing) - [Kevin] There you are! - Who? - Huh? - It's a human! (animal shrieks) - Huh? - He's coming this way! - Run, run for your life! - Hold on! Why are you running away? I just wanted to take your photo. Huh? (lighthearted music) The white lion from yesterday. - Is that a human? - So, I see you live in the jungle. I thought you'd be in the savanna. Hold still a second. - The human has a weapon! It's time to run! - Never! Do you think I'm a coward? - Leo, this isn't the time for that! - [Kevin] Oh, so your name is Leo! - Huh? - Huh? - But how do you know my name? - That bird just called you Leo, right? - You mean you can understand what we're saying? - Mhm. I understand you. - Huh? - Huh? - Coco, I always thought people couldn't understand what we said. Why is he different? - I think that I'm the only one who can understand what animals are saying, but nobody really believes me. This is great though! I can understand you, and you can understand me too. (Leo gasps) - What kind of weapon is that? - Huh? Oh, it's a cell phone. - Is it some kind of gun? - There's really nothing to worry about, it won't hurt you. - Leo, don't fall for it. - I want to use it to take a picture of you. Hold on, and say cheese! - Leo! Are you okay? - Here, have a look at this. He's fine. - Leo! There's another Leo in here! - Take a look. - What is that? - It's a camera. (laughing) - I'm surprised to see a human here. - Toto! - The villain of the jungle! - I don't know how, but he seems to understand us too. - A black panther! That's awesome! Hey, hey, is it okay if we take a picture together? - A picture? You're a fearless little boy. - So, you know what this is then? - Don't get too close! He attacks people, run away! - I'll eat you and spit out your bones! That's all that will remain of you. - No, stop it! - Panja's son, Leo. So, you want to be eaten alive too? - Wait. But I wasn't going to hurt you. - I don't care! I kill all humans! - Toto? (Toto growls) - Leo! (Kevin yells) - My father! - Toto, why are you still attacking people? What are you trying to accomplish? - You'll never understand what I've been through! - Attacking and killing people won't change anything. - Appeasing them doesn't seem to work either, so I kill them in hopes they learn a lesson. - The law of the jungle is that you can kill only for food. By challenging the laws of the jungle, you're in fact challenging me. - So, I get to have the honor of fighting the Jungle Emperor. (chuckles) Fighting you with no true purpose would make me as pathetic as those worthless humans. Listen to me, Panja, Leo. One day you won't be able to contain your hatred for people any longer. I'll be waiting, and that's when you will join my fight. - What's Toto talking about? (beeping) - [Man] The panther's territory is very large. We're requesting to burn some off. - Dr. Halloway says she wants absolutely no damage to the ecosystem. It's best to stay where you are. Typically, the target moves from midnight to dawn, so you're going to have to wait it out. - Roger that, sir. (drum music) (Kevin groans) - Where am I? (Kevin screams) It's the white lion! (Kevin screams) (dramatic music) Don't eat me, I taste bad! - Relax, it's okay! We won't eat you. Don't worry. - But, uh- - We're not lying to you. - Really? - Of course not. - Are you sure? - This is my mother. She's beautiful. I love her so much. - Beautiful, but very scary. - Huh? - I didn't mean it, you're very beautiful! - My father saved you. He stopped the attack from the black panther. - Is that true? - Mhm. - Thank you very much, lion. - Panja. - I'm going to the cave to see Old Dolf. Elisa, make sure to return the human boy back to his people. - I will, see you later. - Your father looks very big and strong. - Huh? Oh, I think he's very gentle. - Leo. - Is your father strong, Kevin? - Mhm! Not only is he strong, he's a super smart genius! - A genius? - Oh, yes. My dad's the one who created this whole place. - What? - Huh? Your father did all this? (laughs) - Awesome, right? (laughing) This place is incredible! I was so surprised. - Uh... I'm not so sure. - Hm? - I grew up here, so I can't really tell, but those who lived in the real jungle keep saying things were better in the old days and that they don't like it here. - No way, that's not true! - But no, listen! When I tried to see what's on the other side of the hill, something came up out of the ground. - Oh, that was a barrier. We have to have them so you guys don't wander off and get lost. - And that is exactly what everyone is saying they don't like! - Dad says that you're animals and need to be controlled. He said that it's what's best for all of you. - You should know that your father is telling you lies! - What? My father would never tell a lie! - It's definitely a lie! (Kevin yells) - [Kevin] Shut up, it's not a lie! (yelling) - Let go of me! It's a lie, a bad lie! - Leo! - You started it when you grabbed my face! - What's going on? Stop it, you two. - But it's not a lie! My dad made a wonderful jungle! - But they all say- - It's only a rumor! Mrs. Lion, what do you think? - It's a very difficult question to answer. - Eh? - Before we were all brought to this jungle, back, back when we lived in the real jungle... Forests were disappearing, and rivers dried up. We had nothing to eat or drink. All we had was sand. Animals in the jungle died one after the other. (elephant trumpets) It was then that people came to our jungle. They caught all the animals. They used force. I found myself captured and inside walls at the same age as Leo. There were people who protested and fought to keep us out of captivity. Despite their efforts, their voices weren't heard. All the animals were uprooted and brought to the Neo-Jungle just after its completion. - So it was a really good thing! You have all the food and water you could ever need right here. - Yes. In the beginning we were happy. It was much cleaner than the old jungle, and more beautiful. We thought it was so wonderful. But eventually, we saw the truth of this place. We were under people's control in every way. There's absolutely no defying humans for any reason. So, we live our lives in constant fear of them. Can you imagine how horrible this is for all us? - Well... Well, why don't you just leave then? - Those who tried to ended up dead. Besides, the conditions outside had become even worse than the cruelty we experience in here. That was when Panja made an important suggestion. - What's that? - [Elisa] He said we should think of this as our new home. That this was where we could build our future. We could start over. - [Leo] But everybody mocks him and makes fun of all of his ideas. - [Elisa] That's only because some of them don't know how bad things were. - But Father surrendered to people! He's supposed to be the Jungle Emperor! - He didn't want to endanger our lives, and staying here keeps us safe. - But that would've been so cool! My father is so uncool! - Leo. Winning a fight is not the only way to prove you have courage. - I don't understand what's going on at all. I always thought my father was so strong. (waterfall running) (frogs croaking) - Hello, Panja. - [Panja] Here's your medicine. - I appreciate it. I'll be okay without it though. - You are the wise one of the jungle, I want you to stick around. - I guess. But if I was to die, that would simply be nature's course. (laughing) So, tell me. Why do you keep looking after all the animals of the jungle? - Because we belong together. - You never forget your responsibility as Jungle Emperor. Does Leo understand your thinking? - That I don't know. It seems that Leo's too young to understand. Oh, and Wise Dolf, I want you to stay inside until you're better. Okay? - Why is that? - I heard that humans are looking for and then capturing sick animals. And once captured, there is no return. - That's touching, but I won't be caught. For I am Dolf, wise one of the jungle. (laughing) - [Leo] How do you get back to your world, Kevin? - [Kevin] Oh. There's an entrance, but it's kind of far away from here. - [Elisa] Yes. But I'll take you there. You don't want to be running into Toto again. - Toto? What does he have such a big problem with people? - I don't really know why. All I know is that he says he really hates people. - He hates us? - So we better avoid him. Come on then, climb up on my back. - On your back? - Hop on. (Kevin screams) You better hang on tight, or you're going to fall off and get hurt. - Okay! (lighthearted music) (Kevin screams) Slow down, take it easy, will you? I think this is it. - Wow! It's amazing! Hey, I didn't know your house was under the ground. - No, no. This is just a path. My place is up there. - In the mountain? - Right. Thank you for the ride. - Don't come back again. This is a dangerous place for a little boy. Okay? - Okay. - Come on, Leo. - Yes, Mother. Okay. Bye-bye, Kevin. - Bye-bye, Leo. - Leo. (melancholic music) - Leo! (melancholic music) Hey, Leo. Do you really think that my dad is telling me a bunch of lies? - [O'Donnell] An epidemic? (missile darts firing) - Yes. The number of infected animals has dramatically increased in Zone B. - Why is this happening now? Go and capture them all. - Yes. And we'll run a thorough medical examination. - [O'Donnell] After that, eliminate every one of them. I don't want it spreading. - Why? Sir, many of them can be saved. - It has to be done. We have the UN inspection scheduled for the next week, and the EU officials will be here too. I don't want them to see a bunch of sick animals running around. - I'm already concerned about the UN representative that's here now. He seems to have a bad impression of us and what we're planning to do. We can't afford the risk of leaving it up to chance. - Yes, but some of the sick animals are endangered species. Please, don't. - I'm about to mark my name down in the history books. The animals are products. (missile darts firing) (dartboard breaks) Trash the defective ones. You know. I'll get rid of anything that doesn't meet my expectations. Right, Dr. Halloway? (Halloway gasps) - I understand. - Daddy! - Oh, Kevin! Have you been keeping up with your schoolwork? - I have. - That's great. Because one day you'll be CEO, and the Neo-Jungle will be yours. - I don't know. - Hm? - Dad, the animals preferred the Neo-Jungle to where they were and are happier here, right? - Huh? Of course they're happier. Why are you asking? - Are you sure? You don't think that we're controlling them too much, do you? - Who's putting those thoughts in your head? Did you... - I swear, it wasn't me! - But it's better if you don't control them too much. They don't like it. And if you do, the animals will hate you and- - Control is good for the animals, and this is none of your concern. - I'm really sorry, Daddy. - Okay, Kevin. Now you can go back to your quarters. - He's still too young to understand, and it was a mistake to bring him. - Not necessary. As heir to Eternal Earth, he must start learning about it now in order to fully comprehend your vision. - Hm. (darts clanging) - Kevin, where were you all day? - What? I haven't been out anywhere today. - You weren't in your room, and you never answered my calls. - Huh? You called me? - I called you and left voice messages. (Kevin gasps) - [Kevin] I dropped my phone in the jungle! - Hey, what is this thing? (cell phone beeps) Ah! - I bet it's something to eat! (monkey munches) It tastes awful! - Hello, Kevin? (monkeys screeching) Where are you? I've been looking all over. Call me back when you get this. Okay, Kev... Well, I guess you were just too busy playing. - I'm sorry. - If it was really important, I could've located you in our system. - So, you control me like you control the animals? - Where are you getting all these ideas from? Stay in your quarters. Understand? - Yes. I'll have to go sneak back into the jungle and find my phone. - [Leo] Maybe my father is a coward. Kevin says his father was really strong. (beeping) - What's up? - [Man] We finally found Toto in grid 14. - Oh. Put it on the monitor. (groaning) Oh. (Toto snarling) - [Man] He's too quick! I can't get a clear shot out! (tense music) (man yelling) - Huh? I know! I have a great idea! - Ugh, Toto. Nothing will stop him until he gets his revenge. - Toto! - Using the flare shotguns on Toto will bring him down. - You can't do that! You have to find another way to bring him in. He's an endangered species at risk. - So what? Burn everything, including the black panther. - I'll get dad to come to the jungle tomorrow when I get my cell phone! Then he can meet Leo! It'll all work out. (tense music) (gun cocks) - It's hiding in the bush at 11 o'clock. - [Man] There he is. Fire! (guns firing) - Toto! (beeping) - [Man] Hey, look at all the animals we got. - Toto's sure to be one of them. - No. All those animals are smaller. - [Man] Captain. He dodged it. - [Halloway] Run for it, run for it! (man screaming) (chuckling) - [Man] Captain's down! Provide backup! Cover me! (man yelling) - All the men are down. - Ugh. Third rate hunters. - Mr. O'Donnell! The animals are completely innocent. Please don't destroy their ecosystem. - Silence! If we don't terminate Toto, the entire Neo-Jungle project might be jeopardize. I would lose millions. Kill it! It's only an animal. (dramatic music) - Daddy... (helicopter blades whirring) - [Leo] Wise Old Dolf! - Hello, Leo. What brings you here? - I have your medicine. Whoa! Is last night's fire still burning? - No, it's finished. Humans put the fire out from the sky. (coughing) - Old Dolf! That's a bad cough. Are you okay? - Don't worry about me, I'll get better soon. - Oh, that's right. Old Dolf is very strong. - What's wrong? Is something bothering you? - Why do all the animals in the jungle call my father a coward? - [Old Dolf] Panja is not a coward. He's the Jungle Emperor. - Does that mean he's the strongest, or that he's in charge? Like a king? - That's not it. He's the one with true courage. - True courage? - And you, Leo, you're the son of the Jungle Emperor. - Why then does everybody in the jungle keep saying he's a coward? - Leo, remember one thing. Your father is strong. - Strong? I don't understand anything! (Kevin grunts) - Ready! - Today I'm gonna do it! - You can do it, you can do it! Come on, Leo, you can do it! - [Leo] I'll become strong! Very, very strong! - [Coco] Yes, yes, you can do it! - [Kevin] Leo! - Huh? Kevin? - [UN Official] You play darts at work? - [O'Donnell] Yeah. It helps me relax. - That fire last night- - It's completely out now. The Neo-Jungle is in perfect order. - Have you adjusted your security in any way? - Just routine patrols. We don't have any concerns. (laughing) - Really? So you're scared of heights? - Don't laugh! - That's right! Leo is trying his very best. - Watch me! I'll show you how it's done. - I don't need your help! I can do it myself. - I know what to do. I'll just try to boost your confidence, and then you'll get it for sure. - That's what I've been trying to do this whole time! - Oh, I know! Leo, follow me over here! - Huh? - Huh? What is this? - Can you jump from that stick over there to this one here? - Huh? That looks easy. - Well, give it a try then! - If you want me to! - You did it, Leo! - Now that I could do. - But the distance you jumped is the same as the distance from this rock to the one over there. - Oh! If you could jump between those sticks, then you know that means... - Oh, then I can jump across to that other rock no problem! - All right! Feeling confident now? - Yes! - Oh, thank you! Kevin, you're more than all right. (chuckling) - I know I can do it! - It won't happen! You're never gonna make it. (chuckling) - Quit being so nasty, you guys! He's trying really hard! - Boy, humans are so gross! - Go back where you belong! - Hey, that's my phone! - [All] Huh? - This thing? - Yes, it's very important to me. I'm so glad that you found it. - You're gonna have to work for something important. - She's right about that! - Why are you always so mean to everyone? - Okay, you can have this instead. Here it comes! - What's this? - What is it? - Beef flavored dog treats. - [Monkey] What's this weird looking animal? So ugly! - [Monkey] You really thought you could buy us off with this? Nice try. - They're delicious, just try some. - This doesn't compare with the mangoes in the forest. - [All] This is good! - Told you! - Okay, now give it back. - Not so fast! - [Monkey] We want more of that stuff! - [Monkey] You have more in the bag. - You want to eat everything? - You ate what he gave you, so you have to give it back now. - You just want to make the human happy! - Just like his father! - Give it back to him already! - We will, if you jump to the other rock. - Hey, that's not fair! - But you already said you would jump for sure. - Does that mean you're going back on your word? - I'll do it! - Huh? - I'll jump to the rock, and then I can get Kevin's important thing back. - Way to go! That's my Leo! - Yeah! Well, Leo, you did say you were gonna do it anyway. Go for it, Leo! - Hm! - Hey, Dr. Halloway. Is the epidemic situation our priority right now? - Yes. Goda and the hunters can deal with the Toto situation. We'll concentrate on capturing the infected animals to keep the disease contained, that way it doesn't spread all over Zone B. - Sounds good. - Wise Dolf? Hello? We've brought some medicine. He's not here. - He knows he's not supposed to go out. (animals chattering) - Leo's jumping off the cliff? - He won't do it. - [Animal] Look, he's shaking! - [Animal] I wonder what's got into him. - [Animal] It's very reckless. - [Animal] Look at him, he's a human lover! - [Animal] It runs in his family! - That makes sense! Like father, like son! - Be quiet, please! Leo can do it. - [Animal] Aw, she's defending him! ♪ Coco and Leo sitting in a tree ♪ - Ah! I am not his girlfriend! - Leo, are you okay? You're shaking a lot. - [Animal] He's scared out of his mind! - No, I'm not! - I know, Leo, I'll go first! - Huh? - I'll wait for you over there. Then it'll be easier for you to make the jump. - Kevin... - You're doing this for me, and I want to help you. We're friends now. - Friends? With a human? - Mm. Human and lion. (lighthearted music) (animals gasping) (animals chattering) - [Animal] He jumped! - [Animal] I can't believe it! A human jumped for Leo? - Amazing! - It sure is! - Leo, it's your turn! Come on, you can do it! (Kevin screams) (animals shrieking) - Kevin! (Leo yelping) Out of my way! (dramatic music) (Leo yells) (Coco shrieks) - I'm ready! (tense music) - Grab and pull! - If you insist! - All right, all right. - Okay. (Kevin screams) (animals grunting) (Kevin yelling) - Come on already, my arms are getting tired! (tense music) (Kevin screams) - Huh? - Hm? - Old Dolf! (animals gasping) - What's going on, and what are all of you doing out here? - Good timing! - [Monkey] Here, kid. - Are you sure? - Sorry. We didn't mean to be so nasty to you. - You should know when you've gone too far. It's important to take responsibility. - I learned my lesson, okay? (animals laughing) - I got a signal at 26 Delta, Zone B. We got an image on the monitor 10 minutes ago. It looks like he's a victim of the epidemic. - He looks bad. We'll capture him immediately. - Wise Dolf? - Wise Dolf? Where are you? (helicopter blades whirring) - Oh no! (tense music) (Old Dolf coughing) - Are you okay, Old Dolf? - No, don't worry. This doesn't bother me. - Wise Dolf. - We found you. Kevin? You came back? - I lost something, and Leo helped me. You should've seen it! - Tell us later. We have to get out of here right now. The humans are here to take Dolf back to the lab. - Huh? - What do they want with him? - Maybe I can talk to them and get them to stop. - [Elisa] I've never heard of an adult human listening to a child. - They might. - What should we do? - Wise Dolf, I need you to please come with me. It will be safer deep in the woods near the border. They'll have a harder time finding us. - I appreciate this. Little birds, you should go, but look for me later. (birds screech) (Old Dolf coughs) (helicopter blades whirring) - I'm coming! - No! You'll end up getting caught by the humans too. - Oh, what about me? - [Elisa] You and Leo can head to our den. Hide in there until it's over. - Leo! - [Elisa] Don't go, Leo! (helicopter blades whirring) - [Man] Here we go. Found the blue wildebeest. - [Man] There's a white lion with him too. - [Man] Is he hunting? - [Man] Who cares? If the lion gets in the way, catch him too. - They found us. Wise Dolf, this way. Come on, hurry up! They saw you. - You go, I'll stay here. - Huh? - I don't want you to get captured too. (helicopter blades whirring) Panja, the Jungle Emperor cannot be caught by the humans. - Oh, this is rare. The animal is turning itself in. - Hey, Father! Where's Old Dolf? (Leo gasps) Old Dolf! - But Father! Let me go! They're taking Old Dolf away, let me go! Why, Father? You could've rescued Old Dolf but you didn't! You're a coward! You could've saved him! - Leo, your father would've saved him if he could, but it wasn't possible! - No, he wouldn't! He's just happy he got away and saved himself from the humans! - [Elisa] Leo! - He sat there doing nothing! He's not strong! My father is weak and a liar. - Huh? A liar? - Since you won't go, I'm going! - Don't go! - Why not? - It's impossible for us to win against the humans. - Impossible? - Father, now I know. You're a coward! - Hey, Leo! Wait for me! (dramatic music) Okay, let's save Old Dolf. - Huh? - So, I know your father said you couldn't win against us, but now I can help you in ways no animal could. We can do this together! - Kevin! - First you hide in here. (catchy music) I know it's uncomfortable, but I need you to relax! I'm scared too, but it's the fastest way! (catchy music) - Are we here? Where's Old Dolf? - Not yet! Don't come out! - Hold it. You shouldn't be playing here. It's dangerous, you could easily get hurt. - Okay! - Hm? - Huh? (wondrous music) This place is strange. - You think so? For me, the jungle is stranger. Wait! Leo, I told you to stay hidden! If... - [Halloway] Is that right? - [Man] Yes. (chuckles) It's certainly helping us get things done a lot faster. (beeping) - I thought so. It's not gonna open if we don't have the password. I'm sure they're keeping Old Dolf behind that door in Dr. Halloway's lab. - Ask your father. Didn't you say he was the creator of this place? - Yeah, but... - Kill it! It's only an animal. - He won't help us. (Leo grunts) - In the jungle, there's always alternative escape routes. - Huh? Yes! Alternate escape route! I think I know one! (tense music) The food elevator goes behind the locked doors, and we're small enough to fit. I've been thinking, and I figured out how to take Old Dolf back to the jungle without being seen. Remember the subway? (pots clanging) - Leo! - [Chef] What was that? (grunting) (chef yelling) Hey, somebody's in here! - Okay! - [Leo] Are we going all the way down? Where are we? (yelling) - [Kevin] It's a garbage chute! (groaning) - Where are we? (Kevin yelling) Kevin! - [Kevin] Almost! (grunting) (tense music) Good. We're inside now. - [Leo] Where do we go? - I'll figure it out. I can look at the floor map that I downloaded to my phone. - Is it okay to pee in this thing? - Sure. In the meantime... You need to pee? - Yeah. (toilet flushes) How do humans do it? It's hard to pee on this slippery thing. - Quiet! Somebody's here. - [Man] What will the doctor do with the sick animal that was brought in? - [Man] She'll give it a checkup on D level. It's so old, it's pointless. - D level? (machines humming) - Is this it? - I think so. - [Leo] Oh, what is this place for? - [Kevin] Um, some kind of laboratory, I guess. Is that... It's Old Dolf! - You're right! Kevin, quick! We have to help him! - Not yet. We have to wait until they've done the checkup. - Checkup? - [Kevin] Mm. They're finding out what's wrong with him. But, I can't hear what she's saying. - Do you think we can get in from over there? - Great idea! Thanks, Leo! (tense music) - What have you find out so far? Is this virus unknown to us? - Well, it's almost identical to the epidemic strain. - Okay. The implication? If we hadn't contained the virus, we would've lost two thirds of the jungle's population in less than a month. We'll need to vaccinate him. Do we have everything in place for a mass vaccination? - Yes, Doctor. - Okay, what's the problem, Doctor? - Daddy. - It was a virus after all. We'll vaccinate him and- - Don't bother with that. There's no point in keeping it alive. - Not true. The vaccine can wipe out the disease and keep it from spreading. - Our priority is the UN inspection, and we can't have any loose ends hanging around. It's like I said before, sacrifices must be made in order to successfully recreate nature. - [Assistant] What should we do? - Well, I don't know. Hm? Huh? (tense music) - All right. I'll take the blue wildebeest down to the slaughterhouse. - No, wait! Let's not do it yet. - [Assistant] But it's the boss's orders. - [Halloway] Our job as scientists shouldn't be to push rare species to extinction. The blue wildebeest is an endangered species. - [Assistant] I understand that, but- - [Halloway] You know I'm right. I want the sample from the wildebeest delivered to level C. - Kevin, we have to get Old Dolf out right away. - It's going to be okay. Dr. Halloway is looking after him, and will make him better. - She has to lick him, and give him special plants. - She doesn't need those kinds of things. - Really? Humans are incredible! Huh? - Somebody's coming! - If the CEO finds out about this... - Don't worry. He's preoccupied with the UN inspection at the moment. Once it's over, he'll understand reason. - [Assistant] I hope so. (grunting) (tense music) - Leo, you need to go in the backpack again. I think we might be lost. Where are we? I wonder how far we are from my room. (tense music) What's this? (tense music) I've never seen these kinds of animals before. - [O'Donnell] Is the research going well? - Dad. - Yes. We've acquired mountain gorilla DNA and Japanese wolf DNA. - Excellent. Go ahead and clone the extinct species. - [Woman] Yes, sir. - Clone? He's making animals? - The UN representative is still snooping around. It's important to close off this area until he leaves, just in case. - No problem. - What's going on? - Shh. Be quiet. - I won't tolerate any more failures. I want you to hurry this project along. Then we can recreate all the animals in the jungle, allowing me to become the creator of all life in the jungle. - Daddy. - Soon, I'll become the creator of all life and replace God! (dramatic music) - I really thought Dad loved the animals. Huh? What the... What's going on? - [Leo] Kevin, help me! (groaning) - What did you do? - You said you'd help me, but you didn't. I don't know how to take a shower! (whimsical music) (Kevin laughing) - That's awesome! - Stop laughing! - The bubbles, they look like a real lion's mane. - Huh. Really? A real mane? (Leo roars) (laughing) (lighthearted music) Kevin, why is it still bright? I thought the sun set already. - It's not sunlight, it's a lamp. But it is getting late. So, would you like to sleep here tonight? - Hm, I guess so. - What's wrong? - It was the shower. Now my scent is all faint, it's weird. - Oh, yeah. Animals and humans are pretty different like that, aren't they? (Leo yelping) - Huh, what's this? It's so soft. - It sure is. Humans use these to sleep on. I know! Come on! Come on, Leo! (Leo shrieks) (laughing) I'm jumping higher! (laughing) - All right! - Leo! (Leo laughs) - Uh, where am I? Kevin, help! - What are you doing? (Leo grunting) (Kevin grunting) Yeah! We're lucky we got you out. Hm? What's the matter? - Well, I'm always messing things up. I came along to help rescue Old Dolf, but all I do is make trouble for you, and I'm still afraid of heights. - No you're not! - Oh, no, Kevin, yes I am, come on, put me down! - Calm down and take a look! See? - Huh? - [Kevin] Just now you jumped all the way to the vase from the bed. - Huh? - That was a high jump, and you weren't afraid! - That's true. - How about we go to the rock tomorrow and you give it another try? - Good idea! - [Kevin] Okay. We better go to sleep early. - [Leo] Okay! It just became night time! - [Kevin] Ah, I just turned the light off. - I have a question, Kevin. - Okay. - My father said animals can't win against the humans. Is it because humans can make anything? I feel bad. I shouldn't have been so unkind to my father. - Just tell him that you're sorry. Now get some sleep. Tomorrow's a big day for you. - Mm. - Goodnight, Leo. - Goodnight, Kevin. (calming music) That's a strange rainbow. It's very beautiful, but... Did the humans make that too? - No, we can't make those. Not even my dad can make them. - Oh, right. They're too big to make. - Leo. - Huh? - Where have you been? We looked all over for you. - I'm sorry! He stayed with me. - Mother! We found Old Dolf in the lab, and the humans are going to make him better. - The humans? - Yes! He'll be okay. - Leo, are you going to practice the jump? - Of course I am. And today, I'm going to make it! - Wait, Leo! - Sorry, Leo's mom! We've got to go! Today's the day! - Come on, Kevin, hurry up! - Let's go! - Ugh. - [Man] Got the signal. - [Man] It's Toto. I knew he'd use this route. - Heh, Daniel. Shoot him. - [Daniel] Got you. (gun fires) - Huh. He's the prey of the day. (gun firing) He's got a tricky gun. - Now Toto has a transmitter on him. - Yes! Well done! - [Man] Should I keep tracking him? Stay on him? - No, we have a plan. - What plan? - [O'Donnell] The carnivorous locusts. (Halloway gasps) We needed a test subject. - But that's still in development! It's not ready to be deployed. - The ability to create life also empowers me to take it away, as I see fit. Or maybe I can test the locusts on the blue wildebeest you're hiding from me. - Sir... (dart missiles firing) - Dr. Halloway. You disobeyed my order to kill the animal. Because of your actions, we might not get UN approval. I'll let you off because of your past achievements. Now level with me. Are you with me or against me? - I understand. I'll deploy the carnivorous locusts. - Hm. (intense music) - What's that? It doesn't look good! Oh no! - Leo, you jumped from the bed to the vase. You can do this! - I knew that well before you came around! - Calm down, this isn't a competition! - Yes it is! - I jumped last night. I can do it, I can do it! - Yes you can! Ready? - Go! (Leo grunting) - Leo, come on! - It's time to get serious! - I know. I- - [Toto] Heh, don't push yourself too hard. (Coco gasps) - Toto! - [Toto] Hey, kid. I hear your father is the one who made this rotten jungle. - How do you know? - [Toto] Those talkative little monkeys told me, though some persuasion was needed. - You better run, Kevin! - You're not going anywhere! I need you for something. You are a human, but you can understand what us animals are saying. I need you as bait. I have a message for your father, and when I'm finished, I'll eat you and your dad. - No, I won't let you! - Leo! - Are you going to fight me? - Oh no! I'll get Panja! - Don't do it! I don't need his help. I have to be strong. I mean it! - You're not making any sense. - Leo! - Stay back, Kevin! - You're wrong if thought I'd go easy on you. (tense music) (birds squawking) - What is that up there? - Isn't that... (locusts swarming) (Toto growling) (laughing) - Oh, you're fairly quick, but you can't win. (laughing) - Leo! You can do it! - If only I thought to bring some kind of weapon. - What's that? (tense music) - Everyone! You have to run. - Kevin, what are you doing here? - Hello. - Why do we have to run? - Look at the locusts! - Locusts? Oh no. The ones that eat everything in their path? - Kevin, get on my back. - Too bad. I'll have to deal with you later. (locusts swarming) (tense music) - The carnivorous locusts have located the target. - The test was successful. Nothing in the jungle will be able to disobey me now. (intense music) - Hey, Father! - You need to stay in here. - I want to help you deal with the locusts. - It's more than you can handle! Toto. You and I will have to take on these locusts. Ready yourself. - Oh, so is the Jungle Emperor giving me an order? - And what if I am? (locusts swarming) - I'll obey, this time. - Toto's following Father's orders. - Here they come, Toto! - Father! (intense music) - Stupid bugs. They're coming after me. - Something's strange. They're not ordinary locusts! (intense music) I knew it. Machines. - They're not living things! - They're robot locusts. - Are they man made? - Did dad make them? - Kevin's there? - Yes. We've tracked the GPS on his cell phone and can tell that he's in the jungle. - This image was captured about 7 minutes ago on a surveillance camera. - It's Toto, damn it! And how did Kevin get there? - Sir. If Kevin is in the same place as Toto, then- - Then he's in danger! Kevin will be eaten by the locusts. (grunting) - Panja! I think the second one up ahead is the leader! - Then I'll get it! (locusts buzzing) - We lost the signal from the queen locust, they've all been grounded. I'll put the locusts in manual control, I just need the go ahead. - Just eliminate them. - You can just call them back, you don't need to go to extremes. - Kevin is far more important than the locusts! I want them eliminated. Come on! Get rid of them now! - Understood. I'll make them self destruct. (locusts exploding) - Father, are you okay? - All that matters is that you're safe. - But look at your leg, you're injured. - [Panja] I'm fine. It's not a big deal. - [Leo] Panja's tough! - Mobilize security and take all the weapons you need. Bring Kevin back safely. Goda, you're in charge. - Yes, sir. (helicopter blades whirring) (beeping) Hm? - What's going on? Something wrong? - No. Nothing for you to be concerned about. If you wouldn't mind, could you please stay within the designated area? - Oh, sorry. I'll head back now. I should be finishing up my report anyways. Excuse me. - Now I've gone ahead and made a fool out of myself by protecting you, a human. - Toto. I'm yours for the taking. - What's that? - Kevin! - What are you saying? - You have a message for my father, right? It's my father and humans who do wrong, treating animals badly. - Kevin. - They took away your freedom, and they create things at their whim. And they take away their creations however they please. Let's go and see my father together. We can go tell him to his face. I'll let him know how you feel, Toto. - Are you sure it's okay, Kevin? - It's okay. (thunder rumbles) (calming music) Toto. Did the humans make you too? - The humans make whatever they please. You're right, kid. I'm... I'm a cloned panther. I was created by humans in a laboratory. - They made you? - They can do that? Create life? - Black panthers went extinct because of the destructive nature of humans. They completely wiped us off the planet, and now they want to create us. I am one of the many black panther clones they made. - I heard they're flawed. - Yes. Our technology, it has its limits. - [O'Donnell] I want you to eliminate them then. - [Halloway] Eliminate them? - [O'Donnell] Yes. I don't want anything that's flawed. Destroy them. - In your father's opinion, I'm flawed. I'm not good enough as an animal or a clone. They only succeeded with one clone so far. I escaped into the jungle and survived, but all the others were killed. They made us, and then killed us. - The humans make whatever they want? - Yes, they create. - And destroy as they wish. - They like to believe that they can control everything about nature. I am a reminder of their delusion! I survived to tell them they're wrong! - I'm sorry, Toto. I'm so sorry! - I find it really surprising that a human boy is crying for us animals. - I'm sorry, Toto! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! (sobbing) (beeping) - I have good news, sir. We have located your son. - Is he still with Toto? Kill Toto. You must save Kevin at all costs. - The 4th Unit is in position. Locked on target. Kevin is way too close to Toto. - [O'Donnell] Aim the transmitter on Toto. - Roger that. - Watch out, it's the humans! (guns firing) (gasping) - What was that? (groaning) - Panja! (Coco screams) - Father, Father! - Leo! - Leo? - Leo, come back here! - Elisa, take Panja and hide! - [Man] It's the white lion cub. - [Man] Do we shoot it? It would've made a good mascot, but too bad. Fire. (gun fires) - It's Toto again! (groaning) (guns firing) - Stop that, Kevin is the priority. - I know! - Let me go, let me go! - Wait, everybody! - Kevin, are you okay? - Why did you shoot at them? Human are the bad ones, they were doing everything they could to protect me! I have to go to Leo! Let me go! - Being in the jungle has made him confused. - Poor boy. - Humans are the bad guys! - Elisa, stop, please. You've done all you can. - But Panja- - But Father, I'll go get the medicine for you. - Don't go. - Why not? You're hurt badly. - It's okay. - It is not okay. Mother! - Leo, you're a strong child. - What are you talking about? - True courage is seen in someone who knows what is important and protects it. I see it in you. You have courage. From now on, you will protect your mother, and everybody in the jungle will rely on you. Make the jungle even better than it's been under human's rule. To do that, you have to be even stronger. I know you can do it, because you're... You're my son. Promise me, Leo. (dramatic music) - Father? - Panja! (dramatic music) - Father! Father! - Is that CEO O'Donnell deluded enough to think he controls all life? (groaning) - You're wrong, Dad! - I don't understand, Kevin. You can't just do whatever you please. - You're the one who does whatever he pleases! You make and destroy things! You're the one who does that! If I died, you would probably just make a clone of me! - What? - Kevin. - [Kevin] You're wrong, Dad! - Kevin. Go to bed immediately. - Daddy! (somber music) - Mother, I'm sorry. Now I know that my dad was never a coward. - [Elisa] He endured a lot. When he was brought here, he wanted to go home like the others even if there was no food or water. But he didn't want to start a rebellion. Then everybody would've been killed. Unfortunately, we have no way of communicating our needs with the humans. Your father decided to suppress his instinct to fight, to protect his friends, even though they all called him a coward. (rumbling) (animals gasping) - [Halloway] What was that? - I'm checking. - Dr. Halloway. There are over 350 animals infected with the virus. They're all in Zone B. - Are they all infected with the virus that we had under development? - [Man] It's a mutation. Our vaccine is effective. - [Man] Halloway, the temperature is rising on the entire plate in Zone B. - Huh? - And boss called. He wants you at the control tower immediately. - [Woman] Attention, all personnel. Zone B is now restricted. All related personnel contact Control. - Zone B? Leo? - We have to talk about Zone B. - Doctor, is this about the epidemic? We have to deal with it before the UN inspection. Initialize Zone B. - What? - [O'Donnell] Abandon everything in the zone. The UN envoy concerns me, and there's Kevin too. If there's any data that we don't want seen, just delete it. - If we killed the animals, what would the UN think? - Tell them we relocated the animals. It's a good chance to explain to the UN that the facility can be restarted easily. Soon we'll be creating animals on demand. - [Halloway] But sir, if you initialize the zone too quickly it'll cause an underwater volcanic eruption! - Initialize the zone! It endangered Kevin. It's been a miserable failure! - What will you tell the UN inspectors? - I have some dummy video footage to appease them. - But- - Are you on the animals' side or the people's side? It's one or the other. - Sir... - Join me, and your future will be bright. I am the new ruler, and the creator of all nature. (alarm ringing) - [Woman] Zone B of Neo-Jungle. Test 1 to be initialized. All personnel in Zone B are advised to immediately evacuate to the Central Mountain. Standby for the initialization of Zone B. Airborne animals to be initialized. The air shield will double in density. Flight restrictions are now in effect. - Hey, what's going on here? Huh? (animals shrieking) (monkeys shrieking) (dramatic music) - [Woman] Commence Zone B initialization. - What are you doing, Dad? - Ouch! It's scorching hot underground! - Hm. The humans are just going to kill us all at the same time. (Leo gasps) I've heard of this before. They call it "initializing". - Leo! - Down at the river! It's bad! - [All] It's boiling! - Boiling? - Coco? This strange wind is making it impossible to escape. Is there another way out? - There's no way! - They're going to burn us all to death. - But that's so wrong! - Humans do evil things. - [Leo] How do I make this stop? - Hm. You have to go to the humans and break their machines, but that's impossible. - [Leo] How come? - [Toto] Don't you understand? The humans are too powerful! - [Leo] But we have to do something! (rumbling) (animals yelling) - I guess it's already too late to do anything. - Mother. - Hm? - What do you think father would've done? (tense music) - [All] You can't! - No, Leo! - Don't even think about it! You'll never come back! - We can't beat humans. - It's not worth it. - Besides, maybe it'll all be over soon anyway! - I don't think so. (tense music) (waves crashing) My father was a brave and strong lion. He was the Jungle Emperor. But I'm not like him. I'm small, I'm weak, and I'm scared of heights. I really am a coward. But Father told me that I was strong, so I'll, so I'll... - Leo, I know that your father can hear you right now. - Okay. I'll go. - Good luck then, Leo. (inspiring music) - Leo! I'm coming too! - Are you sure, Coco? - Mhm! - [Group] Hey, we're coming too! - Really? - [Group] Uh huh. - Hey, scaredy lion! We'll come with you! - Just the four of you won't stand a chance at all. - So, we're gonna come with you too! - Thank you! - Wait for us! We're coming! - I'd rather go down fighting than do nothing at all. (chuckling) - But, how are we gonna get in? - Well, there's an entrance I used once with Kevin. - Huh? - And there a lots of other ways in. - Hm! Well then, I guess that makes you our new leader, Leo! - That's right! Leo, the Jungle Emperor! (fires blazing) (lighthearted music) - Oh, Dad, why won't you answer my calls? Where's Leo? Huh? Why are the sub level cameras on? Is that... Leo! (dramatic music) - It's strange to be marching together. - Most of the time, we're either the predators or we're the prey. - But now, we don't want to give up on each other! - We have to fight the humans together! (tense music) - It's bad! All of the animals are coming in through the underground pass. - Don't worry. That's exactly why we have gates. Where did that UN representative go? - He's writing a report in his quarters. - Okay, good. Keep him there. And call the hunters to man the gates. - [Goda] Yes, sir. - [O'Donnell] If they're going to rebel, then they'll be eliminated. (dramatic music) (animals emoting) (loud banging) - [Woman] Sir, we can't handle this many animals. There are enough of them to knock down the gates. It seems impossible, but the white lion cub is leading them. - A lion cub? (loud banging) - Yes, understood. All right, men. Ready your weapons. Fire on my mark... (dramatic music) - The gates are opening? What? Who opened them? - Come on, guys. Leo, you're in! (beeping) (intense music) - Don't let the animals make it through! Get them under control, you idiots! Kill them, kill them all! Do it now! (dramatic music) - This has gone too far. Stop the animals from advancing. - Aim, open fire! (guns firing) (dramatic music) - Hey, Leo. - Yeah? - Toto told us to break the machine, but what is a machine? - I have no idea! We'll just keep going until we find out! (intense music) (men yelling) (guns firing) - We'll smash 'em! Charge! - Retreat! (loud crashing) - [Man] Sir, the 5th gate is down! - These damned animals! I protected them and now they're betraying me. - Sir, we have a call from the UN! - Tell them to hold! How long until Zone B is initialized? - Three hours, sir. (gun firing) - Hey! (snakes hissing) - Humans aren't so scary after all! - [Both] No threat at all! - This is for hurting us! - Take that, and that, and that, and that! (water sprays) - [O'Donnell] Emergency shutdown! - [Halloway] Sir, don't press that! - We can't let anymore animals get in. Zone B has to go, now! We don't have any other choice. (fires blazing) - Ah! This is awful! Our home is on fire! - We've go to go now! Take this! - Ah, watch out! It's poison gas. - We're running out of time, and I don't know what to do. The only way to go is up, but I'm scared of heights. - What the... An imposter? - [Woman] That's right! The real UN envoy hasn't left New York yet. - Damn it! Where exactly is he right now? (beeping) The power system is failing. - How do you today, Mr. O'Donnell? - Imposter. - [Imposter] That's right. My people lost their land because of your company and this project. - [O'Donnell] What land? - You've destroyed so much nature you can't even remember. You think of yourself as a creator, but all you do is destroy. Now, face the consequences. Karma is finally coming around. I've booby trapped your facility's initialization process. - You can't destroy my nature! - Your nature? Do you hear yourself? You're a false creator. (laughing) (fire blazing) - He killed himself. What kind of trap was that? All operators please support the power control immediately. We must stop the overdrive. - [All] Yes, sir! - You think we've won this, but you've lost. Instead, you've actually saved Eternal Earth. I'll just tell the UN that he was the one who caused this unfortunate destruction. And now, our only problem is those annoying animal intruders. They must be killed. (tense music) (beeping) - This is Goda. Who's there? Answer me now! (monkey yells) (tense music) - [Monkey] This man, he's different from the rest of them. (electricity sparking) (monkeys yelling) - Die! (Toto snarls) (tense music) - Toto! (groaning) - Oh, did you come here because you're afraid to die? Well, coming here has brought you closer to death! My boss will be pleased. Maximum voltage. (Coco screeching) (yelling) - What happened to him? - Something called electrocution. (dramatic music) - Old Dolf! Hurry, hurry! - Youth today are so impatient. - We have to get out of here! - Kevin, wait. (rumbling) - [O'Donnell] Where is Dr. Halloway? - [Man] We know that she's in Zone B or C, but we can't locate her exactly because of all the animals! - [O'Donnell] We need her to repair the power system as soon as possible. As soon as you locate her- - [Man] Sir, the meerkats have set P7 on fire! - Damn it! And where is Goda? - [Man] Sir, I lost his ID signal quite some time ago. (gulps) - Are you sure? Did the animals- - [Man] Help! Tigers and crocodiles have intruded! (screaming) - Oh, no. I have to do something, I can't let the animals take over. Attention all personnel! Initialize all facilities except the central pillar. - [Man] We can't! The system is too unstable! - [O'Donnell] That is exactly why we must initialize everything! (tense music) (beeping) (rocks sliding) - This is big! - Is it still going? (animals groaning) (tense music) - So, all facilities initialized except for the central pillar. That's what O'Donnell wants. - Don't hurt him, Doctor! - Let go of me, it's dangerous! I'm giving him a vaccination. - Oh, you mean- - This will make him better. We keep all the vaccinations on this floor. That's why I've come up here, to get them. - So, does that mean you're on the animals' side? - [Halloway] I regard myself as their friend. - A friend? (rumbling) - Kevin, if we don't stop this, we will all die. I'm powerless against your father. The only one who can stop him is you. - Huh? (tense music) (groaning) - Oh, what's going on here? It's so high up! Oh, is that where I have to go? Did I take a wrong turn? (heavy breathing) - Leo! He can't hear me! Coco, do you think you can get to Leo? - Yes, I can! Through a hole over there! - Okay, can you give this to him? Here. (grunting) - Outside, we made it! We took a wrong turn, guys! - You too? - No! There's no time for us to go back. - Leo! - Huh? - Kevin wants you to have this. (beeping) (groaning) - Move! I'll show you how to use it. - [Kevin] Leo, can you hear me? - Kevin! - Leo, do you remember the garbage chute? - The one we used to escape? - Yes. Do you see the small tower right in front of you? From there you can get to where my father is. Look for the chute, and follow it all the way down. It will lead you straight to my father. Only you can stop him! - [Leo] It would be great if I could. - Huh? - I would if I could. - Leo! (groaning) - Kevin, he can't do it! If he could jump, he wouldn't have a problem, but he can't! (Kevin gasps) So... - We'll go. - Instead! - Huh? Looks like we miscalculated. We're not gonna make it! - I'm hanging by my nails. - Quickly, Leo! Go across our backs, we're your bridge! - [Monkey] We can't hang on forever! - Is that Leo up there? - Can he jump? - He has to jump! - Jump, you can do it! (animals chattering) (Leo yelping) - [Woman] Mr. O'Donnell. Can you cancel the initialization process immediately? - No. I need to protect the jungle. - [Man] But the system's failing! - We're the ones who created the system. Find a way to control it! - Come on, Leo! It will be too late if you jump tomorrow! - But, but- - Fine, I'll go! (Coco squawks) - Coco! - You, you're nothing but a bird. How dare you hurt me. (loud thud) - Hurry up and jump, Leo! - Yeah, but Coco's hurt! - I feel numb, but I'm okay. Jump for me, Leo. I know you can do it! Leo, you are our leader now! You're the Jungle Emperor! (dramatic music) - [Leo] I'm the Jungle Emperor. (dramatic music) I'm the Jungle Emperor! (Leo yells) - Leo! - He jumped! - Come on, Leo! (Coco gasps) - Don't let go, don't let go! - Thanks, you guys! (dramatic music) - [Man] Sir, you have to cancel the initialization immediately! It's uncontrollable! - Don't be ridiculous! The Neo-Jungle is always under control! - [Man] Sir, the mainframe is overriding the initialization. It's taking over control. There's nothing we can do! - What? - What's this? What's going on? Zone B has no barriers anymore! None of the zones have walls around them anymore. - It seems that Mother Earth has calmed her temper. - Maybe not. But at least we can escape. Toto, can you lead everyone out? - I can. - Sir, the system override is unstoppable! - I've tried everything, but we've lost control! - It's funny. - [Woman] Huh? - It's funny how old toys are reassuring. - What are you saying, sir? - Where did... Where did I go wrong? No, I'm never wrong. To restore the damaged nature, you have to recreate it and control it. I'm right. I can't let the computer or animals destroy my creation. The only one allowed to destroy it is me. (Leo snarling) It's the white lion cub! You little beast! - [Leo] I will protect everybody! - Oh no! Destruction has begun! (Leo snarling) What's that? Kevin's phone! I have to protect Kevin. The whole jungle is going to collapse. Kevin, Kevin! Where are you? Kevin! (alarm blaring) - It's no good! - It's like booty trapped! - It's the force of nature! - The jungle is finished, run! (explosion booms) - Kevin! Run! Don't you die on me, Kevin! (yelling) - What's wrong? - I think somebody called my name. (tense music) - Hurry up! No one can predict what will happen next. - We're always stuck dealing with the arrogant mistakes of the humans. - Leo! Why aren't you escaping? - Hey, Coco. I'm trying to figure out which machine I should break. - No! It's way too late to worry about that now! (volcano erupting) (helicopter blades whirring) - [Leo] Are you there? - Everybody's rounded up! - Kevin, Old Dolf! - Leo. The human child helped set me free. - Leo, I'm sorry. This jungle was your home, but it's been destroyed, and it's gone now. - It's okay, Kevin. We're going to go back to live in the old jungle. Come with us! - Thank you, but I can't. I can't just leave this place. I know you guys hate my father, and I understand, but he's my dad, and I can't just leave him. - Your dad. (somber piano music) (loud rumbling) Guys, we're going to help these people! - Leo! - And why should we help those mean, nasty bullies? - We came here to fight them. - Mm, mm. - Remember, Kevin is the one who saved Old Dolf, and now it's our turn to do what we can to help save his friend. - I believe a favor should be repaid. What do you think, birds? - Good idea. - Good idea! - Okay, okay. - Let's get this over with! How tiresome. - Wait, guys! Put them on your backs! - How are we supposed to do that? - We monkeys will put them on your backs. - Thank you! Thank you everyone! (volcano erupts) (dramatic music) - Try to get along with the animals from all the other zones! We all need to work together! Help out the ones who are injured! Let's get everyone out safely! - Leo. - How much further do we have to go, Kevin? - You're almost there! On the other side of the tunnel is the real jungle. Keep going! - Kevin. You really can communicate with animals. (thunder rumbling) - [Monkeys] We can do it, we can do it, we can do it, we can do it! (beeping) - Look out! The shield door has started closing. Kevin, we have to hurry. (beeping) Is this everybody? - Huh? (intense music) (grunting) - No! Leo, it's closing! Leo! - We're not gonna make it! - We can't give up! (dramatic music) - Kevin! - I'm coming! (yelling) - They won't make it! - Leo! (yelling) - Toto! - I'm glad you made it. - Yeah, but Toto, what about you, Toto? - I'm flawed. I'm not supposed to exist! - Toto... - Leo. Even after all this, I haven't forgiven the humans. Kevin, do you understand me now? Our silent rage? - Not all of it, but yes. - That's good enough for now. Thanks, kid. - Toto? - This is my fate. I was born here, I'll do here. (dramatic music) Go! What are you waiting for? Go with the friends who believe in you, they're counting on you! - Toto... Thank you. - Good luck, Jungle Emperor Leo. (somber music) - We'll find the old jungle at the end of the tunnel. The real jungle. - The real jungle. - Will we find enough food to eat? What kind of place will it be? I'm worried we won't survive. - Don't worry, nothing can stop us now. We've begun a future together. - Hey! (lighthearted music) (catchy theme music) - So, we can take care of ourselves. Right, Kevin? (chuckles) I'm excited! Let's go to our jungle! (catchy theme music) (lighthearted music)
