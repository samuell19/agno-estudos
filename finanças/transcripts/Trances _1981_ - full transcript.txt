LARBI BATMA You endure life and its misfortunes So much pain on the altar of truth The ink bottle has nothing to hide from the pen Our kids will dig the truth out with their bare hands In the land of Arabs the sound of owl cries You endure life and its misfortunes So much pain on the altar of truth The ink bottle has nothing to hide from the pen Our kids will dig the truth out with their bare hands ABDERRAHMAN PACO Who can deny us peace? Yes, yes Will love illuminate us some day? Yes, yes Who thought I'd surrender Exhausted by a hopeless struggle? Who can deny us peace? Will love illuminate us some day?

To the union of tea and amber Wormwood and mint are invited My glass stands alone, sad and orphaned It makes me cry Why is he so lonely and rejected? Why is my glass despised?

Nass El Ghiwane are giving another concert at the Exhibition Center in Tunis on a later date. The band will also tour throughout the country. What I want fo tell you guys is that today there's no difference between creation and research. We may fall back on some old piece of music. Come on, we're not machines. It comes out or it doesn't. Yes, it may come all of a sudden. It's a matter of inspiration. Today they force you to do anything. - No, you have to do research. - First of all, you need a good story. Once my mother told me about this song by a father and his daughter during the great famine. We weren't born yet, and neither was the author of the famous “Goulou a Hmida”. The father and daughter were begging with this song. Listen to me, good people The rich man has died The wise and the ignorant hurried to his magnificent funeral Listen, they've forgotten the life coated in silver and gold Did you get it? Yes. While the little girl was singing, her father repeated after her. Then there's another song, “The Stormy Winds.” Have you heard about it, Allal? Listen to the stormy winds And to these unhappy souls Who suffer forever Don't you like it? - No, that's not it. First of all, let's consider the lyrics. Listen to my feedback first. In my opinion, when you say, for example, “The tyrant sleeps” — It's the tyrant's eye that sleeps, since he's unworried, while his victim's heart remains awake. His victim's heart remains awake oppressed by his burden. What bothers me is that your tyrant sleeps. He shouldn't be able to. - Stop kidding. You can't be serious for a second. If you want to joke, it's fine with me, and we will rehearse later. We owe our musical background to Allal. He knows the different Arabic musical scales, whether it is the Rast or Bayati scale or the Do, Re or Sol note. We learned the scales we can sing comfortably. He can read music. It's Allal, open up. Now we'll study the Rast scale. Ascending is Mi and Si in quarter tone and they turn flat when descending. Let's practice with the instrument. One, two — This is low — Mi quarter tone and Si quarter tone. Come on, Abderrahman. Do you remember, Allal, when we came to visit you with Boujemaa — may God rest his soul — to record the song “Siniya™? We hired some bendir drums to record “Siniya” the next day. How long did we rehearse? - Half an hour, I think. I had been rehearsing at the studio for half an hour. I asked the director for a chair so I could play comfortably. He thought I wanted to interfere with his direction. He told us, “Instead of ‘Siniya,' why don't you sing a love song?” I replied that there is plenty of love in “Siniya.” Isn't it true love that gathers folks around the tea tray? “I'm longing for my folks. I'm missing those brave people? And all my neighbors, where are they?” Isn't this love? Yes, but if you really think about it, at that time we weren't recognized. We didn't have any recognition. May God bless Boujemaa's soul. “My brother died yesterday.” “My brother died yesterday.” This song is dedicated to the memory of our brother, Boujemaa. Allah is great! Thank you. Go back to Taourira that you know so well And admire the nymph in rings adorned with henna Her straight and smooth fringe Her burning black eyes with silky eyelashes Her pearl-like teeth Her lively tapering legs Lord, bless her beauty BOUJEMAA HGOUR DECEASED OCTOBER 26TH, 1974 Lord Oh, the saints MOULAY ABDELAZIZ TAHIRI “My brother died yesterday, and I got the news today? I've urged you, give a fatal blow, give a fatal blow to the viper's head. My brother died yesterday, and I got the news today? He died forgotten, far from his roots and his people.” Twixt winds and threatening clouds I alone have to go on I say, never will oblivion darken my heart It's hard for me to forget him Go on, play, Allal. We need our own sound system. Okay, no problem. And regarding the change? Thanks, we'll get back to you if anything new comes up. Perfect, brother. Bye, God bless you, Raja. Good-bye. What do you want to know? Do you want to hear about my life, how I started? First of all, those who were born in 45, '46, '47, '48, the generation born in the late ‘40s and early '50s, were totally focused on Eastern music. Mohammed Abdel Wahab, Farid Al-Atrash, Asmahan, Fairuz, Leila Mourad, Abdel Halim, and the late Umm Kulthum. They were really hooked on Eastern music. I was too. So much so, that one day I turned up at the radio station in Casablanca to sing this type of music. But it was a mistake. And guess who — I got out of it, thanks to Boujemaa. He said, “You want to sing in this radio station? Do you want to be in the choir for the next 20 years? They will never make it, but you can. Do some theater. Come and meet Tayeb Saddiki. He's the director of a popular theater company. They do the ‘Bssat,' folk theater, accompanied by popular ballads.” Then he said, “As a Moroccan, you should start looking for your own roots. To begin with, you should sing popular poetry, then move onto something else.” It says in the “Al Khalkhal” epic: In your exile And your wanderings Wounded like me You can't help chanting beauty Even when yours has long faded Listen to me carefully Listen, this is my story Do you remember the first time at the theater? You were waiting for me with Boujemaa. - Yes, it was back in 1967. - Do you remember Boujemaa? He gave me lots of support. I was young and shy at the time. You brought a bendir drum. Yes, I did. You kept it hidden. It was funny. My mother wrapped it up in a cloth. It was a sheepskin, not a goatskin, bendir drum. - Yes, it was sheepskin. - It cooled down quickly. It wasn't goatskin. It was sheepskin which cools down faster. At the time, I didn't realize that the theater was full of bendir drums. There were more than 30 of them. - Are these Chikhat-dancers? - Mahmud got here early. Lalla is looking so nice In my opinion, Nass El Ghiwane isn't a pop group in the classical sense, but more of a theater group that sings. They're sort of troubadours. Even here, for example, in the Atlas Mountains — TAYEB SADDIKI THEATER DIRECTOR In the Atlas mountains, we have three or four poets who travel from souk to souk, from village to village, singing stories from a political, economic or sociological viewpoint that deeply interests people. This is Nass El Ghiwane's secret of success. Nass El Ghiwane were the first, and they still are. Moroccans recognize themselves in the group. They see their problems reflected in their songs, their daily life and all their issues. Give it to my mom Here you go mom The bread of Seghina, I tasted it and ate it The brooch, the rings and the 100 ryals Are trimmings for my mother Her goodness has no equal I will never eat stale bread again I refuse it Hlima's daughter brought it It's hers She can take it back Here, Mommy Take it, Mommy Prayers and greetings for our prophet Muhammad May God help all who came here and make everyone's wish true. The askers If they asked The faithful if they prayed May Allah praise the prophet Mohammed Brother, this is my plea If] go, if leave you Free me from slavery, free me from your rites Free me from slavery I challenge death down here Oh, brother Arab Oh, my days What do I want from this world? No peace, no calm, Just chaos and move on My heart pushes away life from within When hate and slander reign “The credulous add to my suffering. Black or white, aren't they the same? Why does the net hold the sieve in contempt?” Brother, this is my plea If] go, if leave you Brother, this is my plea If] go, if leave you Free me from slavery, free me from your rites Oh, night Oh, father, oh, Saint Mira Oh, prophet There is no other God but Allah Hey, my people Hey, my people Praise God Praise our God Oh, prophet Mohammed Prayers and greetings for our prophet “Has justice sworn to erase all its traces? Wiped out by evil spells, it's no longer within our horizon. An intrigue of good and evil, masters and slaves. It is our fault that we have no unified language or rhythm. We accumulate weaknesses and a plethora of beliefs. Isn't a man a mirror for another man?” Lord, guide our steps Yes, Lord, guide our steps I say, ‘Enough, please” This world has waited too long for the incentive To undergo new changes This world has waited too long for the incentive To undergo new changes Inebriate us, infoxicate us, with the fury of your sea Oh, friena, face the winds of your destiny Is hunger a damnation in this world? Why do the children's corpses lie forgotten? Inebriate us, infoxicate us, on top of that high mountain Inebriate us, infoxicate us, with the fury of your sea This world gives in to greed Life is materialistic Life is materialistic Death separates us, oh brother There is only one god There is only one god Help us, Lord Aisha-H'mad, where are you? Berber Aisha-H'mad. Listen, Omar... I am praying for you and giving you my blessings. Thank you. May your father's soul rest in peace. Thank you and bless you. Aisha-H'mad is 115 years old, and she walked all the way here. It's incredible. I want to confess something, but I'm sure you won't believe me. Go ahead. You'll never believe me, but I must tell you. I've been having this apparition, the same girl, even in my dreams. One day, she was near a fountain, another day at the bus stop. So what? - Omar, you're never serious. - It's for his own good. He's going crazy. Maybe I've been driven crazy, but this is the truth. This girl by the fountain... she looked at me and sneered. You know what? Go for a stroll. Please, just take a walk. I'm wasting my time on you! I swear, one time, this guy, I saw him at his house reading a book, a huge book. He was reading the same passage a thousand times and another one backwards 150 times. He put spices in a fire pit. Then he put herbs in a censer which caused an explosion. He invented a magic firework. In the name of God, I begin fo reveal the secrets hidden in my soul. I praise the prophet. I utter your sublime name. I ask you in your sublime name. Help me, save me and show me your secrers. This girl is always on my mind. When I read these verses, I saw her in front of me. Wherever I go, she's always there. I have no more hope I have decided to leave Stop crying, eyes of mine Enough suffering for the moment Stop crying, eyes of mine Enough suffering for the moment Time has cheated me, left me in the lurch You who question me, don't ask the impossible My story is on my forehead No desire tempts me Except breaking off and fading away I have a trade, I'm an artisan, but I have a special bond with singing. I would never give up music. I can do theater or whatever, but I can't give up singing. Singing is in my blood. I's something that can't be erased. That's a strange question you ask. If we weren't allowed to sing, what would we do? First of all, I'd challenge whoever forbade me, but let's imagine the worst. I can still do many things — a person can do many things — even if I lose a hand or a foot. If a person has been an actor, he can go back to the stage. One could write poetry or novels. There are so many kinds of art. As I was saying earlier, I don't want to play the drums till 'm over 50, nor Omar the bendir when he's 60. There are new experiences. Art is so wide-ranging. A good question, for sure. I was asked one day, “If Nass El Ghiwane didn't exist, where would you be?” There are other artists. Some say, “They would have been doctors, or just wasting their time, bundling chili peppers in some dump.” - God bless. - “In Sidi Bouknadel.” Now seriously, I really think I am attracted to theater. I prefer acting to singing. “Only the loss of men torments me. Rebuilding walls is small consolation... to the tragedy of children aying of hunger. The loss of men torments me. Burned fields can bloom again with our children's laughter. Only the loss of men torments me. Rebuilding walls is small consolation.” The loss of men torments me Rebuilding walls is small consolation Few people know the truth about Aisha Kandisha. Everyone thinks she's a sorceress, a genie. In fact, she was the first woman ever to be a rebel. She was so beautiful that men surrendered. They could not control themselves. They went crazy for her. She lived at Jorf Lasfar, near El Jadida. When the Portuguese invaded us, her village was the first target of their massacre. Discovering the scene, she had a big emotional shock. “Lost souls, in the veneration of your own longings, you ignore your chained dead. The moss complains to the rocks of the violence of the waves. The storm bursts with no thunder or lightning. A land of motionless stones, white-hot and immobile winds. No one worries about those who are crushed by the spur. No healing miracle. 10 and 10 makes this century the 20th. We still feed ourselves like flies on carrion. We all look alike. Even though the apple differs from the pomegranate.” She met a soldier... who went by the name of McDonald, but was also known as ‘Sidi Majdoul.” He raped her and she killed him. She decided to avenge herselr... on all Portuguese soldiers by appearing to them and driving them mad. According fo the legend, she would bewitch them to the point of madness. Then she would deal the fatal blow to her victims. The Portuguese got on her trail, searching all over for her. At that time, there was a caravan guide called Sidi Ahmed El Mesnaoui. He was a rich, important man. He lived near El Jadida. She went fo see him. She hid in his caravan, and would only travel out at night. When the rich caravan's men saw her they were dazzled by her beauty. They fought each other and perished one by one. El Mesnaoui died in the skirmish. She was given shelter... by a certain Sidi Rahal. He was a wise holy man, who lived near Quarzazate. She went to Sidi Rahal and told him her story. Troops were rallied by Aisha Kandisha and they launched an offensive against the Portuguese, armed with rifles and pitchforks. Aisha was killed in the battle. No one knows where she's buried. That's the gist of Aisha Kandisha's story. Welcome, welcome Welcome, white birds of peace and love I submit myself to you with honor In purity and fraternity Welcome, in the way of brotherhood Lord, you're welcome - Life is made of yearnings - This life is greed - Where does life lead us, brothers? - This life is greed Your fate wounds me And your destiny distresses me Your fate wounds me And your destiny distresses me Welcome, white birds of peace and love I submit myself to you with honor In purity and fraternity Welcome, in the way of brotherhood Lord, you're welcome Tell the scandalmonger, tell the man of evil fongue That he betrays our virtue Tell him that the camel never believed it had a hump But always sees his brothers Tell him that the camel never believed it had a hump The truth cannot silence lies Those that are richly adorned Trance, trance Hey, people of the trance He betrays our virtue Tell him that the camel never believed it had a hump But always sees his brothers Tell him that the camel never believed it had a hump The truth cannot silence lies Those that are richly adorned Here, at ast, comes the time of ecstasy, of frances Those who refuse to their senses the gift of trances shall wither If, if — If, you know — If I didn't trust you, Omar, but I always do — Let me speak. Listen to what I'm saying. If I didn't trust you, Omar, I would have met with that fellow and asked him to show me the contract. I would have made a scene and asked him to show me the contract. But I trust you. I know that you wouldn't do anything like this. Let's hire a lawyer to protect us. We can sue this man —- Listen, Omar! Piracy isn't just our problem. It affects Fatna Bent L'houcine, Qachbal and Zeroual, Hadda Ouakki, even big stars from New York, Russia, China and India. I's a common problem if you don't have a grasp of legal technicalities. You need to be a lawyer to understand all the loopholes in a deal. I'm just an artist. Do I have to be a lawyer as well? If I'd gone to university, I wouldn't be helpless now. - It's true. - Right? We have to solve all the problems amongst ourselves. Actually, even though we're folk musicians who sing about peace, we have to hire a lawyer to protect our interests. Being pacifist is one thing, yielding is another. This guy told us a pack of lies. “You'll appear in a film with horses over your heads.” No one laughed, and we did tour with him. Why? Because we couldn't agree among ourselves. Some agreed, while others kept changing their minds. I've got an idea. Let's do three concerts and a charity show for handicapped children. What about it? When we do a tour — A charity concert — We should do the following: for every six paid shows we give a charity one. Shall we do this? - Why not? This is a Nass el Ghiwane song What do I want from this world? No peace, no calm, Just chaos and move on Al gnawi baba Mimoun Al gnawi, Al gnawi Gnawa songs about their leader Come on, get moving! Get out of here! Every night around 10.00, he'd throw away a huge tub of greasy, stinking water. It really was foul, as if 30 skunks had just passed by. It was unbearable, it absolutely reeked. That's what affected my eyesight. I finally got used to the stench and started giving him a hand. - You started working with him. - That's why I now have eye problems. Give me that box, the little one. That small one. Give me that one there. How much for that? - Sixty francs for you. It's carved from a thuja stump. Sure, but it's not silver. It's genuine thuja. Stop trying to trick me. Bring us some tea. Is that the “Hamdouchi” rhythm? It starts with, “One God.” “There is only one God” — We have the same rhythm here, in Essaouira. First of all, give a tip to the gentleman. I know the “lassaoui” rhythm too. Give him something first. Play the “hamdouchi” again. We are now working on a song based on that rhythm and sometimes we incorporate these scales into our work. Play it again. Let's use the flute and try “When the Days Call Me.” Try to play it on the Sol note. Try again. - It's got to be higher. - It doesn't sound good. You've got to play higher. Get the bass, Abderrahman. When the days call me Oh, my days, problems are increasing Stricken by anguish When the rain beats time like my tears do I carve my words and passions in stones And wander through the maze of my songs When the days call me Oh, my days, problems are increasing Stricken by anguish I started playing music, studying it, the rhythm and scales. I love what I do. If it all goes up in smoke, I'll turn to something else. If I'm in need. Yes, he is right. What do you want to do besides music? We can't limit ourselves. The important thing is to love what you do. If a road sweeper is happy cleaning up garbage, he won't like being forced into managing a car company. It's not certain that he'd be happier. You can't predict the future, especially for an artist. Yes, it can have highs and it can have lows. You might have faith in your work, when it actually isn't worth much. I believe in our path. You're a film director yourself, but if they stop you from making films, you'd find yourself another job. We've all had other jobs too. I was a fisherman, Omar picked oranges. But it wasn't our choice. If I took aside El Maanouni and threatened him: “No more films, you've got to work in a factory,” and then forced him into it, he'd only be doing it out of fear. Take hold of me, take me away Take hold of me, take me away A blacksmith pounds my heart with hard blows If it cools off he adds fire to it My blood drains out in the din I am dealt blow after blow My betrayed blood, the ground will never forget you The beasts in the forest fear you You will never sink into oblivion In this land that remembers the ground will never forget you My betrayed blood, the ground will never forget you The beasts in the forest fear you And the snakes in the desert I will never give up on this betrayed blood Nor on the rights of the weak I was stabbed in the back Can one die more than once? Take hold of me, take me away Why am I sacrificed in silence? What is happening to me? Will my boat ever reach the riverbank? Who darkened your transparency You who stood erect? Father, who is Satan and who is the ogre? When will these stories end? Hey, Baba Hamouda Here is my oppressed sister My oppressed brother My deserted home Brothers in trances, when will freedom come? They threw me out of my land and country May peace reign May my star shine May peace reign May love live May peace reign May good guide us May peace reign Love will not die Peace will not die May justice drive us May Boujemaa walk by our sides May peace reign forever
