I'm waking... and I'm trying to wash... the taste of sewage... out of my mouth. It isn't easy... to do. My doctor... had warned me... I might lose... my sense of taste... and smell. They say... it's a common symptom. I don't have that symptom. I have a different symptom. Everything tastes of sewage. When I go to the tap at five in the morning to drink the fresh water... all I can taste is sewage. Maybe I'm not keeping up with developments, but I haven't yet seen this symptom listed as common. When I ask questions of medical professionals, I'm getting used to the answer, We don't yet know. A couple of weeks before, sometime in early March, a piece of bad news arrived wrapped in protein. On Monday, I'd gone into the editing room off Oxford Circus to help deal with episode two of Roadkill, a new TV series I've written about a Conservative politician who is forward-looking, intelligent, charismatic and popular. It's not based on anyone in real life. Television screenwriters will tell you that in any four-part structure, episode two is always the most difficult. This one has severe bruising from a producers' pile-on, with a lot of people from all over the place giving contradictory notes. The result is a bugger's muddle. I've become convinced the whole thing will benefit from my mature and steadying hand. All cutting rooms are foetid. Space is at a premium in the West End, and the complex machinery thrums ominously warm, not enough to fry an egg, but maybe to coddle one. The three of us - director, editor and I - squeeze into the attic space and do an honourable day's work. At some point, the director, Michael Keillor, a strong, rangy young man from Dundee, with Billy Connolly hair, makes us all a welcome cup of tea. We share a plate of biscuits. On Tuesday, Michael rings to tell me that the previous night, without warning, when he got home, he collapsed. And this morning he can't move... and he can't breathe. This thing is kicking around like I've swallowed a Catherine Wheel. I don't know from day to day what to expect. As soon as Michael told me he had got it, I knew I had to self-isolate. But first, I had to come to my studio to take home my work. I noticed, as soon as I started walking, that I was... air hungry. Uh-oh. It's that quick. Already I'm... I'm not breathing so well. From the little I've read, I've understood that this is a disease which attacks the lungs. Whatever happens, people say, don't let it go to your lungs. Even I, who know nothing, know that we have five vital signs. At some point, probably researching some play or film - that's the only way I learn anything - I picked them up by heart. Temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate and oxygen saturation - that's the measure of how much oxygen the blood is carrying. In a normal person, it's around 100%. So, when it drops below 100, when the blood isn't carrying enough oxygen to the lung... you start to worry. Except, and this is where things get weird, doctors are already noticing that with this virus the rules don't apply. Doctors normally feel compelled to resort to ventilators when patients have oxygen saturation counts in the eighties, because by then they are gasping for air. Only with this disease, they're not. One doctor in New York has taken a picture of a woman lying on her belly with oxygen saturation of 54, and she's chattering away on her mobile phone. What the hell is going on? People who should look ill are looking fine, and nobody understands why. There's no correlation between oxygen saturation and how much oxygen is reaching the vital organs. What the fuck? Another doctor is quoted as saying, The question is whether this vital sign we've been relying on for decades has been lying to us. He adds, It's very humbling in the 21st century with all the scientific advances we've made and we just don't really know the answer. OK, so it may be humbling for the medics, but for me and people like me, a better word is alarming. It doesn't resemble any other disease, says another doctor. You have to go back to HIV/AIDS to find a virus so little understood. Mm. I mooch around our house for a couple of days, pretending to work, but by Friday I'm feeling really terrible. In the pageant of random symptoms which will soon follow, there's only one symptom that will remain permanent throughout. And that's exhaustion. By nightfall, I've crawled into bed and forgotten what energy is. At the beginning, the illness isn't too bad - some coughing and a weird furriness around my lungs. I've also lost the willpower to do anything at all. But then, I'm thinking, well, that can be quite nice. At this stage, I'm looking forward to what you might call a Platonic illness - lots of black-and-white war films in the afternoon with Noel Coward in white shorts pretending to be Lord Mountbatten, rallying the men and shooting at submarines, while my wife Nicole brings me hot lemon, honey and ginger. My GP, Jonathan Sheldon, has begun to Facetime me twice a day, though he says he can tell much more from my voice than from my appearance. Because I'm confused by the mildness of the onset, I say to him, Well, maybe I haven't got it. He replies darkly, Oh, you've got it. But the question is, what have I got? A third of the patients admitted to hospital with Covid-19 die. And half of those admitted to intensive care don't make it. But what exactly are they dying of? This question isn't as simple as it seems. The rush to put people on ventilators is already slowing. With this disease, ventilators aren't doing the job they're meant to do. Blood is coming into the lungs without much oxygen, and then it's leaving without much oxygen. What's the point? And people are having to stay on ventilators far longer than normal. Doctors are becoming aware that a lot of people who go on ventilators may never come off. In fact, Covid-19 seems to be a sort of dirty bomb, thrown into the body to cause havoc. A lot of patients are actually dying of kidney failure. There's muscle inflammation in nearly everybody. In some cases, patients are delirious or suffering inflammation of the brain. But all this is less pervasive than the blood clotting. Beverley Hunt, a Professor of Thrombosis - I didn't know there was such a thing - at Kings College, London, is telling us that she's noticed an awful lot of sticky blood. In fact, she's seeing the stickiest blood of her career. And when you've got sticky blood, she says, you're much more prone to having deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, which is when one of the deep vein thromboses travels around and blocks the blood supply to the lungs, which adds to the problem of pneumonia. Professor Hunt uses an unexpected phrase. It's almost medieval in what we're seeing. After five days in bed, I get up and do something phenomenally stupid. I reach for the wok to make Nicole and me Chinese lunch. My whole family love my chicken in black bean sauce with bean sprouts. It's my set piece. So that's what I do, in my dressing gown, in the kitchen, to prove that I'm putting Covid behind me. Nicole even takes a photo for WhatsApp. But I must have misremembered the recipe, because this is the first time it's ever tasted of sewage. From the first mouthful I'm wondering who made this godawful muck? And the fact that two hours later I am rolling around in agony, rushing to the lavatory, spluttering, coughing and groaning, suggests that the disease has just been waiting for a beansprout cue to get its notorious second wind. On the Friday when I first went to bed, the Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, has made the first of two decisive interventions, which will take the whole United Kingdom towards lockdown. Later, his allies in the press will claim that critics of his performance are enjoying the benefit of hindsight. Not me. From the moment the pandemic was headed this way, the Prime Minister scares me because I keep thinking, Johnson doesn't quite seem on top of this. He has spent the middle of February on a twelve-day holiday among the 530 acres of mixed woodland at Chevening - time, it later turns out, divided between celebrating his girlfriend's pregnancy, negotiating the final details of his most recent divorce, and skipping National Security emergency meetings. He leaves it until 23rd March reluctantly to announce the full measures. He seems to be struggling with his own instincts. I do accept that what we're doing is extraordinary. We are taking away the ancient, inalienable right of free-born people of the United Kingdom to go to the pub, and I can understand how people feel about that. Well, in fact, of course, I hardly need point out, no such right exists. It's a piece of journalistic invention. Inns and public houses have been regulated in the kingdom since the 15th century. A friend of mine, a journalist, once said to me, I'm a journalist. I like journalists. But, Christ, I'd never put a journalist in charge of running the country. It's on the evening of Chinese lunch that my regulator goes crazy. Since neither Nicole and I are confident of successfully using a thermometer, we assume that my bedtime reading of 40 degrees and then some is down to the thermometer not having been used for years. But then, when I wake in the middle of the night, not in a puddle, but in a lake of sweat - I have to change both pyjamas and sheets - we decide maybe it was 40 after all. It feels like it. Nicole has thus far defied medical advice. We're meant to sleep in separate rooms, but we don't. We share a bathroom, too. She's convinced she's indestructible. She always refers to her mother dying too soon, and she lived to 102. Toward dawn, my fever has headed dramatically in the opposite direction, and I start to shake with Arctic cold. Not even extra bedclothes, two thick pullovers and a hot water bottle are doing anything to help. But I can't help feeling maybe Nicole is pushing her luck with her own immunity to this virus when she climbs on top of me, stretches her whole body against mine and says, Don't worry, I'll get you warm. My wife doesn't seem to have grasped the notion of social distancing. So... unknowingly, we've slipped into the mad phase, and it will be with me for the next eleven days. Mad meaning any symptom can appear at any time. One day it's conjunctivitis, next day it's diarrhea. Then it's coughing. Then it's friendly herpes. But just as my illness enters its mad phase, so does the Conservative government. They're exquisitely timed to happen together. The problems in the UK start when politicians fail to use the space granted by the westward spread of the virus to make preparation for its arrival. On 12th March, even Jeremy Hunt, a former Tory Health Minister himself, calls the government's lack of action surprising and concerning. The country remains mysteriously open to visitors from viral centres like Italy and Spain, who pour in at airports unchecked and unquarantined. At a National Security meeting, also on 12th March, the government is still indulging their more fanciful advisors. They have been flirting with a policy of herd immunity - the happy-go-lucky notion that if the most vulnerable among us sheltered and hid indefinitely, it might be possible for everyone else to carry on and take their chances. Not until the very day, 16th March, that I contract the disease - and now this is a happy chance - do our rulers realise that although the theory of herd immunity is conveniently allowing them to let mass gatherings like the Cheltenham Races go ahead, it may unfortunately one day lead to 250,000 deaths. The government immediately throws itself into a desperate U-turn by opting instead for a conspicuously late lockdown. No wonder I'm feeling I didn't need to get this bloody thing. It's somebody's fault. And I can tell you exactly whose. I'm lying in bed sweating, equally bewildered by why our government has chosen to ignore the World Health Organization's urgent advice that it's essential to combine any lockdown with widespread testing, not just among health professionals, but among the population at large. The government is instead - hello, have I got this right? - suspending contact tracing - are they crazy or what? - claiming it's not scientifically necessary. Yet how the hell are they ever going to control the disease unless they know who's got it? It doesn't make sense. In fact, I mean, nothing makes sense. At this point, I'm not sure whether to put this down to my delirium or theirs. I keep waking in the night firmly convinced that right now - usually around 2am - is the perfect time for me to fulfill my mission. What is this mission? Is it military? Is it diplomatic? Is it artistic? I haven't the slightest idea. That's why I'm up and out of bed and standing in the middle of the bedroom, ready to go. Go where exactly? Who knows? One morning, in the middle of this week, Nicole has asked me how I'm feeling. I have replied, One of my bodies is fine, but the others aren't great. I have gone on painstakingly to explain that the virus has divided me into several separate identities which all sleep in the bed together side by side. Clearly, I'm off my head, though, as always when you're off your head, it doesn't feel that way to you. But am I any more off my head than a government which can't admit that they are dispatching front-line staff into work with Covid-infected patients without suitable protective clothing or equipment, in spite of the impassioned testimony of those same front line workers that they are being sent naked to work? And why can nobody who speaks for the government confess that because they were so keen to monitor the dangers to the NHS, they neglected the equal danger to workers and residents in the care home sector, where deaths are set to rise to alarming levels? Why are we moving our most vulnerable out of hospitals, where they are protected, into care homes where they aren't? Can anyone explain? I can see this devilish virus seems to be cleverly retrofitted to find Johnson out. It's smart. It knows how to play to all his worst weaknesses. The virus is nothing if not adaptable, because it's meanwhile outwitting the leader of the United States by targeting his quite different shortcomings. In his book The Art of the Deal, Donald Trump has revealed that the best way to do a deal is by denigrating your opponent. This is man who speaks nostalgically of punching his high school music teacher and giving him a black eye. He has spent February denigrating Covid-19: You're not as bad as the flu. Few Americans are at risk. But the morale of the virus seems strangely undaunted by his tactics. Perhaps it's read his book. Trump is a man with a life-time fear of contamination. That's why he always has wet wipes to hand. He has a special horror of women's bodily functions. During the election campaign in 2016, he has referred to one of his interviewers, Megyn Kelly, having blood coming out of her wherever. He has also repeatedly characterised Hillary Clinton's bathroom break during a Democratic debate as disgusting. You may predict that this president is not ideally equipped to cope with something which breaks into your body and violently disrupts it. Trump can't conquer his natural disdain for anyone who gets ill. Sick people are what he calls losers. When he later contracts the disease himself, he is flown by helicopter to the Walter Reed Center where his treatment costs $100,000. But I've noticed among some of my friends that a similar attitude, though not articulated, is not far from the surface. A famous film director remarks to me that I'm the only person he knows who's got it. Do I detect an undercurrent of rebuke, as though it's not the sort of thing the middle classes are meant to get? Apparently, I've crossed class lines by carelessly catching a disease which generally attacks manual workers and ethnic minorities. After all, it's already becoming clear that you are twice as likely to die if you're poor. Diseases follow the social gradient. And skin colour. In England and Wales, you are four times as likely to die... if you're black. But, again, am I dying? This is another very good question. I've entered the vomiting phase, and I'd say it's the worst so far. Six times daily, I'm beating a track to the bathroom. I can't keep anything down, and the result is I'm losing strength. Nicole is horrified because I'm the colour of Dracula, but also frustrated because I won't eat anything. But what's the point, I ask, if it just comes up again in an hour? And for the first time, my doctor is seriously worried. I don't like the sound of you. You need to go into hospital for them to take care of you. I say, I won't go. It's too dangerous. Hospitals are full of people with Covid-19. You've already got Covid-19, he replies. How can it be worse in hospital? I don't know, I say. I just feel it is. All right, he says, but I'm not letting this go on much longer. The doctor is bombarding me with horse pills, antibiotics of industrial strength, which he says may explain the permanent taste in my mouth. Next morning, I wake after a torrid night, convinced that Polos will solve the problem. Nicole is so relieved that there's something I actually want to eat that she buys me ten packets. Unfortunately, it's some time since I had a Polo, and in the interval it's obvious from the first one I pop in that the manufacturers have changed the formula. They are now flavoured with sewage. On the tenth day, my sole diary entry reads... Total despair. 'But we have to get through this together, 'and we are getting through it together.' My mood is aggravated by the dense blizzard of cliché which is fogging up my television. You would think, given that soon, the UK death rate will be higher than in any other country in Europe, and the UK testing and tracing system the least successful in Europe, you would think a note of contrition might begin to be heard in the public realm. But no, the preferred route through the crisis is bullshit. Government ministers must now, every man and woman, toil their way doggedly down the centre of the bullshit highway. Words like failure or mistake are forbidden and replaced by the anodyne challenge. Yes, we faced challenges is government-speak for Yes, we failed. Ramping up is government-speak for finally doing something that we forgot to do. We followed the science is government-speak for Don't blame us. The word that's getting beaten up worst is mediocrity. The only qualification for being in Johnson's cabinet is that you must possess a mind vacant of all doubt about Johnson's scorched-earth approach to Brexit. If you have any reservations, you're excluded. And this has left the Prime Minister with as good a statistical chance of forming a strong administration as if he were to insist that all ministers must have ginger hair, or stand in their socks at over six foot ten. Everywhere, as one unknown minister after another stutters and stumbles on the airwaves, people complain that this is a cabinet of mediocrities. But this does violence to the word. Mediocrity suggests middling ability. You and I are mediocrities. These people are incompetents. Ministers like Robert Jendrick... Dominic Raab... and Helen Whately, the hapless Minister of State for Social Care, who comes across like a quiz contestant who's forgotten the name of the fourth Beatle - and who is, by the way, in charge of care homes - such people don't begin to meet my definition of mediocrity. The nadir of the government's performance comes from... the Home Secretary, Priti Patel. Patel has been recklessly reinstated by Johnson after being driven out of government for trying, in 2017, to pioneer a one-woman guerrilla British foreign policy in the Middle East. She has taken twelve secret meetings with Israeli politicians, including the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, while being careful not to inform the Foreign Office - an omission which she later denies to a newspaper. Plucked from disgrace, she is today asked by a journalist at the regular press briefing if she will apologize for the failings of resources and equipment which NHS staff and their families blame on the government. Patel replies that she's sorry - if people feel there have been failings. The journalist, a little taken aback - everyone except Patel knows the facts - gives Patel a second chance, and asks, But are you apologising for the lack of Personal Protective Equipment which has led to mass infections and the deaths of several nurses and doctors? Patel replies, I'm sorry that people feel that way. All right, maybe watching television in my condition is a mistake. My mind is racing back to Suez and to Iraq to recall instances of any public figure trying to get away with a formula of words as despicable as this. But at least, as I sweat, shiver and vomit, it gives me an insight into what the medical profession have to put up with, answering to their masters. Come virus time, the Conservative Party has discovered a hitherto undisclosed admiration for nurses. But in June 2017, Johnson, Patel and Matt Hancock had been among the 313 Conservative MPs who were seen cheering when a motion suggesting the lifting of a pay cap which kept nurses' rises down to 1% was, with the help of their votes, defeated in the House of Commons. If I wasn't gagging anyway... I'd gag. At least, now that Johnson himself has come down with it, Conservatives have stopped downplaying Covid-19 and recognised that it is ten times as deadly as flu. For the first time in the right-wing press, the disease has acquired a heroic dimension. Can't think why, but for some reason it's no longer a disease for losers. Suddenly Covid is for men, in particular, blond white men who have extraordinary resources of character with which to fight. Our Prime Minister turns out to be one of these. Although he will later pay due tribute to the very nurses whose pay rise he opposed three years previously, Johnson will also remember to tip his hat to his own natural buoyancy and refusal to give in. Gosh, how I wish I had Johnson's character. I've been foolishly assuming that my own survival would be down to a mixture of good luck, the care of my wife, and the expertise of my wonderful GP. My character, thank God, doesn't come into it. On the fifteenth day, much to Nicole's alarm, I've lost six kilos in ten days. I've got the voice of an old man and the body of a Bosnian prisoner of war. But then, for no obvious reason, Day 16 is different. I'll never know why. 6th April 2020 was always going to be a date of special significance. All right, I'll tell you: it's the 50th anniversary of my first full-length play premiering at Hampstead Theatre. In other words, today I've been a playwright for fifty years. Because this is an anniversary which only I had noticed, celebrations were always going to be muted. I hadn't heard of street parties - and in the circumstances they're non-existent. And yet 6th April is also the day - inexplicable and unexplained - when I stop being ill. I wake up and say to Nicole that I quite fancy a croissant. I might as well have come out of a coma to judge by her reaction. Are you having one of your delusions? No, I really do want a croissant. But you haven't wanted anything for a week. No, but I would quite like a croissant. I look around. I smell the air. It doesn't smell of sewage. When later I speak to my friend Howard Brenton, who has also had it, he says that the disease departs like a demon leaving your body. You see? Medieval, again. It's going to take a long time to get better. I know that, and I know not to rush it. I'm very weak. I know to take it easy. Not, for instance, to go back to running the country. But I'm overwhelmed by a sense of the arbitrary. I admit that later that afternoon, when it is clear than I am indeed clear... I begin to cry - not altogether selfishly, not just at my own good fortune, but at how unfair it all is. So many people, many younger than me, fitter than me, better than me, poorer than me, are going to die when they don't need to. Liam Donaldson, the one-time Chief Medical Officer in England, said, To err is human, to cover up is unforgivable, and to fail to learn is inexcusable. I don't have survivor's guilt. I have survivor's rage. Not long after I started writing, in the late 1970s... I made a television film called Licking Hitler, which was about a black propaganda unit run from an English country house during the Second World War. Because very few people had heard about the unit's existence and the filthy work it did, and because the fight against the Nazis had, in myth, always been portrayed as an exclusively noble endeavour, fought with impeccable high principle, the film caused quite a stink. People were shocked. Who would have thought the British, of all people, would need to sink to lying and libelling in order to the fight a just war? Why was it necessary? In 1978, that question still meant something. Since then, I've kept up my interest in the relationship between public life and untruth. When the website PolitiFact established by careful research that only 4% of claims made by Donald Trump were true, I was taken aback. Really? Was it as much as that? But after years of thinking about these things, I am still bewildered by the British handling of this latest chapter in our island's story. Surely, looking abroad to the examples of Angela Merkel in Germany or Jacinda Ardern in New Zealand, something must have stirred inside the head of at least one thinker in Downing Street. Given how well those two leaders were doing, and how badly we were doing, did it really never occur to anyone in power that possibly following their example and levelling with the public might be a more fruitful political tactic? Not necessarily for the virtue of it - let's be realistic - but - hey! - just for the efficiency. Explain, please. What is stopping the government from admitting... Since 2010, we underfunded the NHS. Our attempts to introduce competition between hospitals have been a catastrophe. Our denigration of junior doctors and nurses was a public relations disaster. When the virus came, we were slow to react because we took a wrong road, and the Prime Minister's mind was elsewhere. We were wrong when we pretended contract tracing was suspended in March for scientific reasons, when in fact it was because of a testing capacity shortage. We have been short of PPE throughout, we've neglected care homes, we should've closed the airports? What... What would it actually cost to confess that we were talking through our hats when we claimed, at a press conference, to be an international exemplar in preparedness? Apart from anything, wouldn't it be so much easier? Is the labour of lying really worth the effort? Isn't it draining on everyone's ingenuity, conscience and resources? Wouldn't Johnson himself look and feel far less exhausted if he were liberated from a narrative scarcely anyone believes? With one bound, wouldn't he be free? Does it never occur to the great minds of British politics that there is a direct connection between honesty and popularity? Why is that idea so hard to grasp? Has no one in the current government ever met the bereaved? Do they not remember Hillsborough? Or Bloody Sunday? Or the residents of Grenfell Tower? Have they really not yet learned that the most soothing possible bandage for the wounds inflicted by grief... is the truth? Do the families and friends of the dead not deserve it? I'm tired of reading that people want to be spoken to like adults. In my experience, it's adults who lie. I want to be spoken to like a child. It's to children all decent people tell the truth. Perhaps this desire is in line with my new personality. I'm so glad to be alive that I wake every morning wanting to thank the universe for continuing to host me. In recovery, I am suffused with joy. Unexpectedly, my character now allows me to say things like, This is a beautiful glass of water. I'm startled to come out of this experience a hippy. I call my exercise teacher, Matt Bamford, and ask him what exercise I should take to recover. He says, None. You can't exercise your way out of this. And sure enough, he's right. One of the most moving experiences of my life is to sit and feel my body mend itself. It regains strength, independent of anything I bring to the process. I do nothing. It knows what to do. My wife, by contrast, has also developed a new personality. Her saintliness has apparently vanished with her fears. When she sees me walking unsteadily along the corridor, greeting her with a croak, she exclaims, Oh, my God, it's like you are ninety. I'm not staying married to a ninety-year-old man. I've been very ill, I say, I'm convalescing. Well, convalesce quicker. Nicole notices that in recovery I've developed a newfound over-sensitivity to movies. When, in a film we're watching, John C. Reilly whacks Gwyneth Paltrow hard across the face, Nicole asks me if I am aware that I've just shouted, Don't do that. When Edward Kennedy drives Mary Joe Kopechne off a bridge in Chappaquiddick, then swims to safety without rescuing her, do I realise that I've just shouted Bastard? Yes. I guess the virus is in me... and always will be. The day will come when Covid-19 will be forgotten, just as Spanish flu is forgotten. Already, after a period of fierce forbearance and self-censorship, the culture warriors are rearming. Sir Graham Brady, a Conservative backbencher, has been lecturing the workers, telling them to improve their attitude to the end of lockdown. He tells the public they're a little too willing to stay at home. Conservative MPs are settling back into their comfort zone, making their timeless complaint that the public are once more letting the politicians down. I'm walking round the garden, wondering whether Sir Graham ever asks himself why anyone should trust a government which refuses to trust them. I think of... the great James Baldwin: Allegiance, after all, has to work two ways, and one can grow weary of an allegiance which is not reciprocal. I go back into the house. I make tea. Right now I can only do the simple things. But by doing simple things right, my plan... is to beat the devil.
