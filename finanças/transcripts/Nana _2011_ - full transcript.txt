She's cute as can be. Come on. Come on, hurry then. Look how he walks... Pig... He's going to be dead your pig. You're going to dance around long? Don't go break a leg now. Come here, Alain. Put your bucket down. Let's put him on the side. Come with me. He's beautiful this pig. He sniffs. The bucket. The pan. I'm afraid he'll break his leg. I'm afraid for his thigh. The pan. There's lots of blood. Lie it ﬂat. Come closer... Don't be afraid to get in there. It's all nerves... It's going to be nice and smooth. Now, that's bad. But no, he's not dead. He's a fighter... He's too stiff. Rest a bit, rest now. There, ﬂat. Watch the knife! - Then I pour it in the bucket? - Wait! Nice and warm... Go on now. Stir the blood, Alain. That's it, we're good. Perfect! On the boots, it's blood or paint? It's blood. Blood... Yes. At first she thought it was paint. Isn't life wonderful like this? Isn't it beautiful? Let's get to the fire and warm up! Right kids! Feels nice, the heat. Sure feels good. A bit of straw... We start it up again. A bit more fire... It stings the eyes. Sure stings the eyes. Plenty in my eyes. There's lots of smoke. Looks like the sky. He has wonderful ears. Good enough to eat. Etienne, he's still sniffing. What? He's still sniffing. Say what? That's what they do, the pigs. I'll take his shoes off, so he can slip into bed. This one's holding strong, no? Sure, but it'll give. Monsieur the Pig. Monsieur the Pig. He's going to burn the pig. He's beautiful, really beautiful. And well roasted already, no? I think so, yes. Now, we'll get... the ladder. You should lie it ﬂat... length ways. Watch out kids. Not bad there. Over here, right? Yes, just a little closer. Closer, that's it. Let's put him on top. Done! Let's just rinse this thing. Now comes the scraping, right? Scraping time. He doesn't like it much. Are you afraid? We'll let him go. He makes too much noise. See how he screams? Why he screams? Because he feels like a prisoner. He feels like a prisoner. See, they go through that hole. Wait, they'll be back. There's one, he's all tiny. There's another one, he has writing on his ears. Now I've got one on my back. There's a black one. They have a tail like corkscrews. A corkscrew it's like this... You're right. See, they're not afraid of you. They are little roasts. This one is nice. He's huge... huge. - They're eating up your boots? - No... No? Playing with them. Fanny? I'm scared of the cows. Don't be. They won't say anything to us. They won't come, Peppy? No. Look, there's dandelions. It's like... blowing... You see, there's lot of dandelions. Lots of dandelions... There, you see them? It's dandelions. Wait, I take one. There! You see, he's beautiful. And there's a blow of air on it. He's beautiful... It can ﬂy away this. There's lots everywhere. Must not squash the dandelions. Must not squash the ﬂowers. They all come after us. I fell down... That's nothing. You didn't hurt yourself? Pappy, they come after us! They're coming after us... Oh, we're screwed. Look... You see the moss... Pappy, I can try? I can try to do that? There, rub your hands. You see, the moss takes the smell off your hands. It takes your smell away, see? I can try, Pappy? Wait, wait, wait... There. Now I can try? And me, I can try? And then... you must raise the trap before sunrise, because if you come later, well, a beast can pass by and eat it all. And you end up with nothing. The fence isn't finished. Please get it done. Your daughter. Bags are very heavy, Mama. We're almost there. Here it stings... Here too... We were almost there. Your hands are so cold. My hands hurt. Tastes good the tail of the ﬂower. Very good. Come! Here Mama. I'm going to do it... like this. And after... 7. After comes... 8. 9. 9, it's hard to make. Now, I can write everything. March Month of March. I write this. Today... we go... to the cinema... of... ci... of... circus. To the cinema of circus. I know this. I know who wrote this. March it's good. This, it's good too. This. This. There, that's good! That's good, all this I've done with the numbers. Not bad at all. Not bad... at... all! His paws. His paws, of the fox. So his paws... They're a bit scratched. 3 paws. And the other one? It's alright? It's alright the other one? I think she's a little bit damaged this one. This is his tail. This is his paw. This is his head. Well, that's all. He has paws. Don't be afraid. Stay here my fox. And don't do bad things my fox. I'll make more fire... Make more fire... I put this right behind the ladies. Nana, mind the feet... My turn! Look, there's plenty over there. We have to hurry now. I turn you into a frog. What? I turn you into a frog. I take this, and after... he'll burn real good my fire. More... That's nothing. A long time ago, in the time... in the time of our ancestors, a man and his dog were murdered. A Great Spirit passing by found their inanimate bodies. After... noticing that... the heart... of the Man was already rotten, but that the heart of the Dog was still beating, he replaced the heart of the Man with the heart of the Dog and he took clay to shape a new heart for the Dog. This done, the Great Spirit clapped his hands 3 times. And you don't clap your hands? This done, the Great Spirit clapped his hands 3 times. In a... In a very bad mood, the Man turned his anger against the Great Spirit. The Dog was soon back up on his feet and full of gratitude, wagged his tail in sign of recognition. That's why, nowadays, Humans are so mean. They have... the heart... of a dog. What? They're cats. And this? Dogs. And what's that? What is it? Don't know... And that? A duck. No. And this? A donkey. And this, it's a bird. This, it's a rabbit. This, it's a pig... fish. This, it's a rooster. This, it's a hen. No, it's the opposite, I think. Here I can jump. What a fucking mess! What a big fucking mess... I'm sick of your bullshit. It's here. You think you're so smart? This goes where? I know it very well. This goes here. And after, this it goes where? It goes here. You're full of crap! I'm sick and tired of her crap. Oh no, I'm not going to sing their song... Don't know why they say... they say... shit to my singer. Don't know why they say... People who say that, they're not nice. Right, I think it's not too hard to fit... Real potato. Potato rotten gravy. Not in my bottom! There's a bumblebee. Go away you Sun! Alright then, if you want to come along. What a fucking mess. We lost some parts... Where are they? Where are they these parts? The police... she goes here. The police, the police, the police... I'm going to tie up the car. Like that, she's not going to move at all from her place. And after, all of a sudden, she will disappear the police. And she will never put anyone in prison again. Because that's a mean police, be careful. We'll put her in prison too. Once there was a day, a man and his dog were "murtrered". A Great Spirit... A Great Spirit passed by. He replaced the heart of the Dog with the heart of the Man. The heart of the Man was already rotten, but the... heart of the Dog was still beating. The Great Spirit clapped 3 times in his hands. The Great Spirit clapped 3 times in his hands. And became then in a very bad mood. "Reco... ga... gnition". A very bad mood... "Reco... ga... gnition". And after... I know how to read now. A very bad mood... Against his anger... Then became... To make... his... anger... Come on, piggies! This here, it's a little heavy... There's a bit of cushion that's heavy. That's good. Wait, the rest... I don't think it's heavy. Wait. I take off one thing. One thing. Say that it's not heavy. No, it's not heavy! We hold the two sides... It's not heavy... That's going to leave me alone... It's because we must lift up this thing. I'm going to try anyway. You're alright, Pappy? Yes. Processed by L.V.T. - Paris
