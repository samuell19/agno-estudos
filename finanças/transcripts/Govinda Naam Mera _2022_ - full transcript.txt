(Voice Over) Everything is this old man's fault. Gopi Vishwakarma, my father. Number one Action Director in Tamil film industry. He had come to Mumbai to shoot action for a film called " FIRE IT UP" Film didn't fire up the box office. But, Asha Waghmare sure lit up a flame in Gopi's heart, a background dancer. During their outdoor schedules they started spending a lot of time indoors. And the outcome was - me, their son - Govinda. Gopi wasn't just dark on the outside but inside too. He started a family back at home in Tamil Nadu too. Wife: Charulatta, and son: Vishnu Vishwakarma. One evening Gopi horse backed his way towards the setting sun. The horse came back, but alone. Gopi was found dead in the valley. And to take advantage of the situation Charulata and Vishnu reached the doors of our bungalow. As per Gopi's will - my mother and I have inherited the bungalow. But still they filed a case against us. We have been fighting the case for the past fourteen years. Oh Lord Ganesha - Please save my bungalow. Sister, did you go to the the beauty parlour yesterday? Oh, you noticed - I just blow dried my hair. How am I looking? You always look hot. Sister, I needed some advance... Aren't there too many mosquitoes around here, kill them no? I want a divorce. WHAT!! Divorce? - Stop overacting! - You don't talk to me. - You want a divorce, right? - Yes!! Okay, give me two crore rupees and I'll give you divorce Two crores for what? - Yes, two crores!! - Your family took dowry from us. My father spent two crore rupees for our wedding, don't forget that! What, two crores! I told you to stop overacting, right? If you try to speak to me - I'll squeeze your lemons. - Ouch. - Oh, sorry. And you, stop sulking. How are you named Waghmare? Tiger killer? You jump on the bed at the sight of a rat. So called "Tiger Killer". Get lost now - don't ruin my mood early morning. Towel. [Inspector Javed calling] (yelling) Hey heyyyy. Aunty, please don't act crazy - everyone knows me here. What are you doing? Please sit properly. Good morning. Aunty, please sit properly. (Yells) Hey, have you lost your mind? Why did you get mom like this? You should have got her comfortably in a cab. Who will pay the cab fare? - You dead father? - How dare you speak of my father? I will, do whatever you want to! First of all - I got your mom from her house. The house is on the fourth floor, - plus, there is no elevator - I know about that! To top that - she just sits on the chair and cribs. - Mom. Mom. - She isn't helpful at all. Mom. Aunty, please stop swimming. Mom, please wait, please wait. Govindya, did you get the pictures? Hey, you better stop calling me Govindya, My name is Govinda!! Alright, whatever, stop cribbing and show me the pictures. Are you doing okay? Look at these. Holy mother. - See this. - What the... And this. Listen, does anyone else have these pictures? Mr. Godbole - this is the last copy. Keep these with you and show your magic at court. Let's go mom. Your Honour - we've already submitted Gopi Vishwakarma's original will. At the last hearing, Vishnu Vishwakarma's advocate had asked us for a legal proof of the marriage, these photographs are a legal proof that on the 5th of July, 1988 - Gopi Vishwakarma wed Asha Deviji Waghmare as per the Hindu Custom Act. According to the Hindu Marriage Act of 1955 Asha Deviji is his first legally wed wife and Charulatta Ji is the second wife. Therefore these people have no legal rights over this property. Thank you - Your Honour. Your Honour, we'd like to charge defence lawyer Kaustubh Godbole, Asha Waghmare and Govind A. Waghmare, under section 420 and 192 of the Indian Penal Code for deceiting and giving false evidence to the court. What false evidence? These photographs are real. Sir these photos are real, but the wedding is a sham. Your hon our - in the year 1988, Gopi Vishwakarma was the fight choreographer of the film "MAA KI MARYADA", the same film in which Asha Devi was a dancer. Excuse me, assistant choreographer. Mom, here our life is falling apart and all you care about is the film credit. Hold on a minute Sorry. In that film - a particular scene was shot, in which Gopi Vishwakarma and Asha Devi were actors. And, in that scene they were getting married. These photos are from that very scene. In fact, your hon our, The film "MAA KI MARYADA" 's producer, Mr. Shaam Lal Sisodia is present in this very court. Shyaam Lal Sisodia. Hello. What kind of a producer is this? When the film flops, this is what the producer looks like. What Mr. Godbole? Mr. Godbole - What is all this? Sir, I too have discovered all of this right now. I am charging you with fraud and attempt to mislead the court. No, no, no sir, please sir - please don't do this sir. Sir, please have a look at Govinda's family they are extremely poor people. Please look at his mother, she's been on a wheelchair since ages, and his wife has made his life a living hell. Why? She's asking for two crore rupees for the divorce. Why two crores? Her father spent two crore rupees during the wedding. She's asking him to return that. These people took dowry? No no sir, it was an expense at the wedding. You are aware how expensive catering has become nowadays. Mr. Govind A. Waghmare. Sir, Govinda sir. It says Govind A. On the birth certificate. Yes sir, that was a spelling mistake. So live with that mistake. The two crore rupees that your wife's family spent during the wedding, I want to see all the reciepts of the same. Or else I will advice the family court, to charge you and your mother under the criminal act of taking dowry No, no, no, no sir - Mr. Godbole. Yes, I will look into the matter. I had told you - you'd be screwed. You are screwed!! Should I screw you, should I? What is this action, does anyone behave like this in court? Screw me, come on, screw me. Screw me, come on, screw me. This is not done, this is not done!! Vishnu, this is not done - no no. Order, Order, Order! You and your mother - both of you will beg for alms. - Shut your trap. - I will charge both the parties. The next hearing for the case will be in 10 days - Next. Say something to him!! Aunty, please keep quiet. Where the hell did this half dead producer come from? Hey, leave the producer aside. Why did you mention the dowry - I got screwed over. I was trying to gain sympathy. Sympathy, seriously you'll gain sympathy? Oh, mister, mister I'll stop the car right away - stop creating a ruckus. What are you even doing? What the? Someone please ask aunty to shut up - control her! Whom did you call an aunty? Obviously you're the aunty - who else? What the heck are you guys up to? Isn't there any kind of decency here in Mumbai? Excuse me, you decency - focus on driving the car, she's a senior citizen - give her a break. Who did you call a senior citizen? - If she's a senior citizen? - Shouldn't she have more decency, that's not how it is where I come from. Shut the hell up! I am a senior citizen, you're still a sixteen year old - happy? Give me water, give me some water, someone give me water. - Here take it. - This letter had come, check it. - Okay, listen. - Don't touch your mouth to the bottle. Okay, alright. Ajit Dharkar is one of the biggest client's of our firm, Oh - the politician. He isn't a politician, he just funds the political party. Owns a massive 300 acre land in Nashik. He's in the grapes and wine business. But, he is Maharashtra's biggest drug lord. He has a son, who's totally useless. His son wants to make a music video. So, I've recommended your name there. I told them Govinda will do good direction and choreography. The budget for the music video is 20 lakh rupees. Your fee is 8 lakh rupees, in which one lakh is mine. That's absolutely fine Have you fixed the meeting yet? When is it? First you apologize. I am very sorry, do you want me to kiss you? Did you guys find a singer? Shut-up and drive the car. Did you guys find a singer? [Driver humming] Pull harder. I am falling down. Now you go to the other side. Aunty, please sit lightly. - Hey, come in the front. - Hey, are you telling me? You hold her from the bottom. One One, two, three... I am dead, I'm so dead. Hey Govya, you're back, very good. - How are you doing Govya? - How do you think I'm doing aunty? My wife's screwing me at home, the judge is screwing me at court, and here I'm screwed because of my mother's weight Don't ask me stupid questions!! This is how you speak to your aunt? - Do it, do it more. - Leave my ear. Doesn't understand anything. Sister - I've made some curry for you, - I'll get some bread from the market. - Okay? Hey you, you come along with me! Why should I go along? I am going to charge fees for all these things later. Whatever - please take it from her. Let's go in quickly. I want to murder that stupid Kaustubh. Mom, he was just trying to gain some sympathy. Trying to gain some sympathy? Here I sit in that wheelchair, drooling my life out, trembling with illness - trying to put up an act What more can one do to gain more sympathy. Calm down mom, please - let's go in. Calm down you say? For the last fifteen years I've glued myself to this wheelchair, trying to put up an act so that we don't lose the bungalow. I am deceiving my own younger sister for this. My back has gone for a toss sitting in that wheel chair. I truly loved Gopi. I wasn't aware of his family from the south, by the time I discovered we were already married. And, I was pregnant with you. For the first time after I got married Gopi took me, Gopi took me to the bungalow. I am aware of this story, I've heard it a hundred times. Can you honestly tell me one thing? What? You did get married right? Yes of course, are you doubting your mother? I am not doubting you. We got married at the temple in film-city, how many times should I tell you? The temple was a part of the film set. The temple was a set but priest and rituals were real. Govinda, Gopi was indeed my husband. But everyone used to call me his mistress. No one ever respected me. Mom, mom - this isn't the time to be emotional. - Not at all. - Not to be emotional? Yes absolutely, you should keep one thing in mind. You won't get respect even if you get the bungalow. I don't want it - I just want the bungalow. Gopi also named the bungalow - Asha's Residence Asha - in this case of your residence, we both are going to screw our lives over. Hurry up, the DOP is shouting his lungs out. Move it slightly towards the right, pan it to the right Just get this done at once. 3... 2... 1... Action... He looks so good. He looks average. My favourite is Ranveer Singh. He's a subtle actor.

Gauri's father willingly spent so much money on the wedding. All this spending is in a way dowry. Don't you dare ask me for it? I'll rip you apart. Why the hell would I ask you? Man's real intentions are revealed during the wedding. Why do you always talk about getting married? Even in my dreams you kept asking me to get married to you. Already one marriage has taken my life. I won't take your life, I will make your life better. [Gauri video calling] Oh Suku, no Suku, please. Ohhh, Suku's there. Hi Suku. Hi, Gauri, how are you?

Yes? What did you take from Javed? Drugs? Right? You purchased drugs, right? - How much do you need to give him? - You, buzz off. How much more do you need to give him? I'll pay him how much ever I have to, stay out of it. You beggar, you don't even have the money to buy your own pants. - You're the Beggar's wife, buzz off. - Get lost! You have to arrange for 1 lakh 80 thousand rupees anyhow. I wanted to drag you and Asha on the streets. Gopi was my husband. I had told you; You'd get screwed. But everyone used to call me a mistress. Give two crore rupees, take your divorce. You are going to lose the court- case and this bungalow will be owned by your step-brother. You and your mother - both of you will beg for alms. Kaustubh, what are you reading? It's a copy of the judge's order. What's written in it? You're going to be thrown out of your house, Govinda. - What? - Yes, they've given Vishnu six months. If in those six months no one claims the property, the bungalow will be his. But, then, our hearing is today, right? What will we do now? - Vitthal Sir? - Yes? Vitthal Sir? Can anything be done? Listen, today's session I'll take care of it, the next one you will have to see, - It'll cost two lakh rupees. - Two? Two lakhs? Vitthal sir, isn't it a bit too much? Alright, it's fine. At the next hearing you can handover the keys of your bungalow to your step-brother. You are here to stay in the bungalow, right? Where do these misers come from? I'll arrange the money. Sure? You'll handle this matter right? Yes. Thank you. What do you mean "I'll figure"? Where will you get it? - What are you even saying? - You don't stress now. Just focus on making the music video. I'll speak to Dharkar for an advance right now, we'll see about later. And listen, we need to gain a lot of sympathy from the judge. So make a mournful face and let's face the judge I don't need to make one, it is already like that. Don't ever give up. What happened? Why are you so lost? Gauri has sucked my blood out. Your wife is crazy. Since so long I'm asking you to get divorced. Suku, I'm trying very hard to do that! Alright, let's forget about all this. It's our first day of rehearsal with Sandy Sir.

Where did you find these fraud people? Sir, please don't call us fraud. This Sandy Sir used to be high the whole day, What would we do? We had to do it ourselves at the last minute, - Yes.

Do you understand? Oh Javed Sir, What a surprise, you're here? Got ya, enough of your crap! This is my last warning, I want my money within the next 24 hours, or else I'll shoot you in an encounter. Do you understand what I'm saying? Yes, get lost!! Suku, I'm here, near the station to commit suicide. I'm requesting you to come and meet me or else I'll hang myself. I am sharing the location pin. Do come, please. Hang yourself. Life is just an illusion. Hey, buzz off, get away. The concept of life and death is non-existent. One day this body is going to turn to ashes. The soul is eternal.

You loser, you don't have the guts to commit suicide. No Suku, seriously. Alright, come with me. Suku, how much do you think this package might be worth? 4 to 5 crores. Crores? Listen Govind, destiny has given us an opportunity to start a new life, You give Gauri two crore rupees and get divorced. Even if you let go of the bungalow, it's alright. In the remaining amount, you, mom and I can start a new life in a different city. Suku, but who will give us this amount of money? Mumbai has a lot of dealers, we will surely figure something out. Should I take it? Yes. Keep it inside the bag. Hurry up. Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry. Hurry up, do it fast. Let's go, leave, leave, leave. Let's go. Let's go. I'm coming. What happened? Why are you laughing? Suku, I'm going to be a free bird. This woman has caused me so much of trouble.

Gauri, I'm really sorry, please let me in. Please let me in, this is hurting me a lot. What the, is he going to pass out here? I am not going anywhere. Suku, what should we do? - Suku, what should we do now? - Shush. Let's leave from here, let's leave right now. What will we do after going back in? Shush. Shush. Let's leave. That window! Govind, you didn't murder her right? Do you think I'm a killer? Yes? I'm scared of action, that's why I became a dancer, or else I'd be an action director just like my father. Shut up! Please check, check if she's dead or alive? I won't be able to do that, I'd puke my guts out. You, you check, Suku, please check, go ahead. (Screams) I AM ALIVE!! Ghost, ghost, ghost, ghost. Govind, I won't be able to do it. You check, please go ahead and check. - Suku? - You go ahead and check. There is no heartbeat Suku. Suku, Gauri is dead.

We both will spend rest of our lives behind bars. Suku, I don't want to get jailed. - I don't want to be jailed. - Really? (sarcastically) I would love to!! Listen Govind, we need to hide her, we need to make Gauri's body disappear. Should we just throw her in to the sea? No, no!! The water will throw it back on the beach. We can't take her to the beach. Then? Hey Suku, I'll go dig a grave right out side in the garden, we'll bury her right there. Here itself? I'm telling you that will the best thing to do. You start cleaning up the room, I'll go dig the grave. Oh, listen, listen, check if Baldev is still around. Baldev, Son of a... I think he left. - Let's go. - Yep. Let's go. I'll close this. Stop, stop, stop, stop. Let's put her in, I'll go back up and get the remaining stuff. - Go behind. - How will I step behind? You will have to get the body slightly in. Don't drop, don't drop the body, wait, wait. I'll have to let go, I'm letting it go. - Don't drop it, wait. - I'll have to let it go. But if you let it go, holy mother of... - Govind. - Yes?

[Phone ringing] - Hello. - Hello, Govind, this is Baldev Chadda here. Who Baldev? Baldev Chadda, Gauri's Boyfriend, bang bang. You moron, why have you called? Gauri's ignoring my calls since yesterday. You deserve to be ignored. You please tell her to forgive me, It was by mistake that I gave that online transfer idea. No mercy for you. And, if you call me back, I'll break your face. - Where is Gauri? - She's out of town, cut the call. [Doorbell ringing] Hi Manju, welcome. - Didi, I am here. - She's gone to Pune. Pune? She usually tells me before going? She must have forgotten, give me your stuff. Ah. First some tea, not for me, for you, You work at four different house-holds, you must be getting tired. Go ahead. Ah. If there is some tea left, then for me, half a cup. [Manju calling] "The person you are calling is not answering" Where is the table? - Pune!! - What? Yes, Gauri took it with her. Why? She said that she's going to sell off all the furniture of the house, and collect the dowry money from me. Is Didi doing okay? She isn't picking up my phone too. - (SHOCKED) Phone? - Yes. She might be asleep, Leave that, why are you getting stressed? You go continue you work. - Tea? - You have it. Listen Suku. Hello. Do you have Gauri's phone with you? I completely forgot about her phone. Oh damn!! What happened? This Manju is suspicious of something, she was asking about Gauri's whereabouts. She even tried calling Gauri. It didn't ring here at home. Did you bury it with the body? I don't know, how should I check now? You've kept the drugs safely, right? Yes, yes. You calm down, I'm on my way. Alright. Are you out of your mind? I'm not going to be his girlfriend. He's a married man. Relax, you have to just act it out. He's smitten by you completely, you just need to give him some attention. Once the bungalow is mine, I'll give you one crore in cash and a 3-bedroom apartment in Andheri. Then you can break-up with him. This is 100 grand, a gift from me. The bungalow is on Govind's mother's name? Yes, but it is my mother's bungalow, She's the first wife. His mother wooed my father and got everything on her name. That bungalow is going to be mine. You tell me? You need to give me time to think. Alright! But remember, there are a lot of dancers in Mumbai. Vishnu, be truthful, did you kill Gauri? I swear, I won't utter a word to anyone. Listen, don't talk trash, why will I get her murdered? You relax right now. You take your glares off, what relax, relax? How am I supposed to feel relaxed? I've buried his wife and come here. What did you tell me, in 6 months that bungalow will be yours, and you'll give me one crore in cash and a 3-bedroom apartment, right? It's been three years I've been romancing that jackass, and now this murder. If something happens, I'll murder you and then commit suicide, - you have no clue what I'm capable of. - Nothing will happen, nothing will happen. Why have you picked up Gauri's phone? Someone has murdered her, I've transferred all the data from her phone, any message or details found would be helpful. Suku? I hope you've not mudered her? Yes! And, now I'm going to kill you too. Sorry. Calm down. Who else can kill her? *Chanting Prayers* Sweets. I'm leaving. Daddy! Daddy! Please forgive me. Why are you crying? - Dad, please forgive me. - What happened son? I took out the large packet of drugs from your locker last night. From my locker? But, how do you know my password? Easy, 2969. Correct! How do you know it? - 29th is your birth date. - Correct! 69 is your favourite position. Correct, idiot, that's my birth year. You shouldn't keep such an easy password. Shouldn't keep? Tell me what happened last night. Tell me what happened last night, where is my packet? - Hello!! - Mr. San deep Dharkar, namaste. Six pack sandy, the fame is in the name. Listen Sandy, I have an offer for you. I've got six crore rupees, Give me the drugs and take the money. You've called the wrong place, I don't have any stuff. Why are you lying to me Sandy? You know your father's locker is full of stuff. For how long are you going to live under his shadow? I'll make your filthy rich. I'm sharing the location pin, come fast. I met with an accident last night. Leave the accident, where is my stuff? I was unconscious, woke up in the morning. - And the stuff... - Stuff... Stolen. What, you lost my stuff? I'm going to kill you. Dad, I'll die, let go, I'll die. Why were you born? - Why the hell were you born? - Leave me. Why the hell were your born? Gauri has been murdered. And, you guys have buried the body outside the bungalow. Daughter-in-law, my dear daughter-in-law. Aunty, stop your drama. Yesterday you were abusing her. Witch, you witch. Shut up! Or else I'll push you too off the staircase and murder you. And, hide the body. Yours too means? Have you murdered Gauri? Have you lost your mind? Do you think I would've come to pick this old lady up if I'd have killed her? Who are you calling an old lady? Who are you calling an old lady? Shut Up! You're the old lady. Let's go there. You've written your full name? - Alright, I'll check it. - Javed Sir. - I am Manju. - Yes, what's the issue? I work at this bungalow, Asha Niwas in Khar. Govind Waghmare's bungalow? It's not his bungalow, his step-brother is going to win that case. Oh, you know a lot about that case. Gauri didi used to consider me a close friend. She used share everything with me. That Waghmare had destroyed her life. He had taken dowry from her. She was a sweetheart. Why you are stating everything in the past tense? Something's wrong? Something has happened to her? See this!! While cleaning the house today, I found this under the sofa, a piece of glass. It's part of a center table and it's got blood on it. The table and didi both are missing. Waghmare told me Didi is in Pune with the table. But, I know, he's murdered her. Listen, calm down, are you the FBI? No, but, I've seen all the episodes of CSI. Waghmare had once pointed the gun at Didi and threatened to kill her. - Oh! Didi? - Calm down Manju, he doesn't have the guts to shoot me. Do you wish to register a complaint? No sir, I don't want to get myself involved in this ruckus. No, right? So you leave. Okay? Share your contact details, I'll see what is to be done. - And, listen! - I know sir, unless the killer isn't caught I won't leave the city. I've seen all the episodes of CSI. I'll leave. Yes Manju? You had asked me to collect information about the case. Manju, spit it out. Govind's going to share Gopi and Asha's wedding pictures at the court. They were married? No, they are some stills from the film, "Maa Ki Maryada". Alright, tell me what do you want? Didi, one smart TV, I'll watch web shows on it. Smart phone, watch them on this. Why have you called? Didi, Govinda has killed Gauri didi. I found a broken piece of glass with blood on it, I handed it over to the police inspector. Which police inspector? Our local police inspector, Inspector Javed. Manju, why didn't you call me? I have called you, right? Where are you right now? Outside the police station. I'll call you back later. Why have you planted a flower there? As a tribute to her. - You seriously a moron Govind!! - Suku? Who did you call a moron? Keep quiet guys. Govinda, I need the truth. Have you murdered Gauri? Have you lost you mind? Ask Suku, I was with her the whole time. Is anyone suspicious about all this? Manju is. Manju... What should I do? Gauri's phone is missing. I think he's buried the phone with the body. Should we dig up and check it out? No no, we don't need to dig up or check for anything. See, if the phone is buried it'll discharge in sometime. Kaustubh, I don't want go behind bars, please. Please, save me from this mess, please. Let me think, please let me think. Oh, Yeah! I'll call Vishnu's lawyer and speak to him. What will you speak to him about? I'll tell him, give us two crore rupees and the bungalow is yours. - What? - Yes, once you have the cash, you three can leave Mumbai for good. Wait a minute, wait a minute. Two crores aren't enough, Suku, - Mom and I, how will we manage in this less money? - Yeah? No, not two crores... actually 18. What? 20 lakhs are mine. One crore eight lakhs is good enough to start a new life. - He's correct. - What do you mean he's correct? It's still better than going to jail. We will hand over the bungalow to him and leave from here. Yeah! How can I let go of my mother's bungalow? Listen, stop obsession over this bungalow, the bungalow has your wife's body burried right outside. If you end up staying in this house, she's going to haunt you for a lifetime. She'll come, sit on your head. Guys! Hear me out, look at me. Everyone from now is going to behave very casual, we have to behave as if nothing has happened. Act very normal. Ha ha ha ha. Aunty, you are overacting, you have to act normal. Govindya, you leave. Where does Manju stay? Hey, excuse me Manju? Hey!! You're Manju right? You are Baldev right! Yes, how do you know? Gauri didi had described you, saying you have a pig's nose, like this. Excuse me, don't talk crap. Where is Gauri? Come up, I'll tell you. From there? From there, upstairs. I was so tired yesterday, I slept off very early. I slept around 08:00 PM itself. Ritu, what even, why do you give me such long dresses? How will my steps be seen in this? You should give me something short. - How are you? - I'm doing good. - Everything good at home? - First class. Even at my place everything is normal, great actually. Please say hi to aunty for me Hello. Govind A. Waghmare! Who is this? I am Baldev Chadda speaking, Gauri's boyfriend. You fool, I told you once before not to call me, you don't understand that? Yeah?

No, I won't go anywhere with you alone, what if you murder me? Murder, what are you talking about? Whose murder, what murder? Gauri's murder.

You moron, you have murdered her. Gauri had taken a life insurance policy worth two crores from me, and the nominee is you, you understand? Me? Two crores? I have no clue about this policy at all. Really, I swear on my mother. Why are you swearing on your half dead mother? Alright, hear me out. I won't put you behind bars, understood? And yet I can get you the full amount. What say? How? Where's the dead body? - I cremated it. - Oh man. What? What? We won't get any money now? I'll do something about it, I'll arrange for the death certificate, inspection form and other documents. - Okay? - Listen. One crore for you and the other half for me. What? And, listen to me, you smart ass, the full amount will be deposited in your account. If I don't get my share, I'll report the fake death certificate, and put you behind bars. Don't stress about it, I won't betray you. Alright, done. Alright, you're looking good. Listen? Yeah? Did you ever love Gauri? Gauri who? What are you doing? I'm buying Asha Niwas just for two crore. I've taken loan from a good friend, against this flat. Are you mad or what? This is the only property we have left. You've sold everything in Chennai as well, we already have a liability of twenty crore rupees on our head. Ma'am will you relax, that guy is a close friend, he's a huge builder, there's nothing to worry. Once the bungalow is ours, we'll be making a deal with the same builder, for one fifty crore rupees. Don't stress about it mother... I'll handle it. Should I call for a cold drink for you? Anil, please come in. I am repeating this agreement for everyone again. Waghmare family has transferred the ownership of Asha Niwas to Vishwakarma family. Waghmare family, now, has no legal right on this property. In due payment, Vishwakarma family is going to pay Waghmare family two crores in cash. Govind. "Govinda" you mean?

You only went to the cops like a smart ass... Now suffer. They are going to call everyone one by one. Take your phone out, I am sending you a video right now, got it? Show this video to Javed, and do speak about Gauri's murder. Did you get it? He's an extremely dangerous man sir. Manju, did you see any packet of drugs in the house. But, I'm sure that he's murdered his wife Gauri. I had given you that piece of glass right? Yes, I have sent it to forensic for testing. Watch this video sir, look at the kind of predator he is. Your lying to me? Sorry Waghmare sir, sorry. Sorry? Yeah. - Javed Bhai. - You shut up. Your lying to me? - What is this? - Sir, it's all a deception, just a deception. Oh Waghmare, Today I'm going to play a thief and you be a cop. I haven't done anything Mr. Waghmare. Here comes Inspector Waghmare. I haven't stolen anything Waghmare sir. - I swear on my mother. - Really? No Lady, you shouldn't lie to me. - Okay? - Listen, hit me harder. - Okay? - Hit me harder, Waghmare Gauri if I hit you harder you'd get hurt, right? It turns me on if you hit me harder, now common, hit me harder!! Take this! Even harder. - Take this! - Even harder Waghmare. Now, take this. Waghmare sir I haven't robbed anything Waghamare sir. - Your lying to me? - No Take this! Your lying to me? - No - Yeah. - No Waghmare sir. - Sorry Sorry Waghmare sir, sorry. Take this! Javed sir, she recorded the whole thing, she edited the video and made it look like this. After seeing this video anyone would think I use to torture her, but it isn't like that. She was the one blackmailing me, (suspicious) She was? I mean she still does. Yeah, sir, He was the one emotionally blackmailing her. He had such a beautiful wife, yet he was having an affair outside. - Affair? - Affair? With whom? What happened sir? - Bhonsle. - Sir? Do you have a warrant sir? Check inside, you want a warrant? We'll show you one, stand here quietly, give ma'am some security please. Despande, check that side. Yes sir. You go around a lot with Govinda, right? Stand straight right here. Sir, check this out. Sir, I have no clue where this has come from. Take her. One second, really sir, I'm being framed for this. Let's go. There has been some misunderstanding, please explain you father. Please. You moron. I am not going to leave this girl... she has dared to touch Dharkar's locker, - We got the stuff sir, relax. - That's only 250 grams, the remaining 750 grams should also be found. We are on it sir. - I want it back in next 2 days. - Yes, two days sir. Or else I'll set all your asses on fire right here. Sir, I have no idea where it has come from sir. - Sir, it isn't mine. - Bhonsle, make a list, I'll tell you what is to be done. Please keep quiet for a bit. Please don't put me behind bars, someone is framing me. Sit down quietly. Suku, are you okay? Javed sir, she's telling the truth. She's innocent, she hasn't done anything. Of course you will protect her, because you're having an affair with her. Sir, he has done everything. Sir, I'll tell you each and everything. Sir, when Sandy met with an accident, - he was right there. - Suku? He asked me to come there right away. He has all the information about the stuff and the drugs. Suku, what are you even saying? - I am not framing anyone. - Shut up Waghmare. - Sir, he's murdered his wife too. - Suku? - Murder? Why are you lying? - Don't act smart, - I have proof. - Which murder have I committed? - What proof do you have? - Don't act smart. How am I being smart? Why are you lying Suku? - Sir, he is not letting me talk, sir. - Shut the heck up Waghmare. - Yes, speak up. - Sir, when we reached the bungalow, his wife was already dead. He was the one to tell me, let's bury her body in the garden. Sir, you come along with me, I know exactly where the body is, I'll show you. There on the right, right there, dig right there. Dig, dig properly. See, right here at the back, dig here. Sir, there is nothing right here. Where is the body? Sir, he had buried it right here. What, me? Sir I've not killed a rat my whole life... how can I harm a human being? What the hell are you both up to? Sir, I've kept the proof safe... you come with me; I have the proof. Check it thoroughly. Where is it? Sir, it was kept here safely. Let me check it myself once. - Stand here. - Sir, it was right here. What did you hide Suku? How are you interrogating him without a lawyer? This is illegal. When I stick that rod up somewhere all the legalities will come out, understood? - Sir! - Gauri, his wife, where is she? Ex-wife, last week they got divorced. Why are you lying, when did they get divorced? Suku, I was going to share this good news with you, but before that only you've made me the killer. You shut up, I'll kill you right here, all this is happening because of you. - You tell me the truth. - Let him go. Sir, are you seeing the aggression, she's trying to attack me in a police station. Sir, I absolutely think she is the killer. You stop your dramatic act. I'm asking you again, where is his ex-wife Gauri? I don't know sir. Sir, now we've been divorced. She's free now and so am I, we really don't know where she is. Sir, Baldev, Baldev is Gauri's boyfriend, he'll surely know where she is. Sir, you please call Baldev. She's absolutely correct sir, Baldev Chadda, Ghatkopar East ZBI insurance, he will surely know where Gauri is. Thank you Suku. Baldev Chadda. So, you are Gauri's boyfriend? No sir, I'm just an insurance agent, sir that phone to phone guy. Hey, just answer whatever you have been asked, understood? Which insurance had she taken? Sir, life insurance. - How much was the policy worth? - 10 lakhs sir. Hey, don't lie, the policy was worth two crores and Govinda was the nominee, he had told me. Ma'am she had no source of income. She wasn't eligible for any policy worth more than 10 lakhs. Do you have any information about her death? She's dead? Accidental death, natural death or foul play? You say? How would I be able to tell you that sir, that's inspection team's job. Where is the body sir? There is no body. So, who should we be inspecting? Please inspect Suku's brains, I guess she's lost it. Sir, I am telling you, he has murdered her. Excuse me, please avoid any kind of false acquisitions or else I'll be charging you with false allegation and defamation case. Sir, please understand, my client Mr. Waghmare has been emotionally very low. Six days ago - he had to transfer his bungalow to Vishnu his step-brother. Yes, sir Vishnu, please call Vishnu, Vishnu knows all about the murder. Sir, everyone knows about this murder... Except the police. How sad. So, you have purchased Asha Niwas? Yes sir, I've bought Asha Niwas. Do you know about any murder? No sir, we have no idea about any murder. Hey, Vishnu, don't lie. Sir, he knows about the murder, Vishnu what are you saying? - Hey, keep quiet. - Sir he knows about it. - Shut her up. - Shush. What Shush? Alright, if there has been no murder, then where is Gauri? Where is Gauri? Does anyone know where Gauri is? Sir he knows it, he has murdered his wife. If you have murdered her, tell them. What the hell is happening here? No one has any clue about the murder, there is no body found, Gauri is missing. What? Sir, I haven't killed her, I don't know. I haven't done anything sir, he's the one, he's done it. Sir, they are playing with me, I'm the one being framed. I have no clue sir. I really have no clue. I haven't murdered anyone sir. I haven't used any of those drugs. We didn't find anything sir, this Govind seems to be clean. Have we found any information about Gauri? No sir, we've sent a team to Pune, her family resides there, we will get to know something. Alright, you leave, get some rest, I'll see what has to be done. Fine, sir. Tell me, have you really killed your wife? Govindya, We've got the bail, let's go. Sorry we harassed you, But, please do no got to the press, okay? No sir, I respect the work police do a lot sir. Can I meet Suku for a couple of minutes before I leave? Thank you sir. Thank you sir. Suku? Suku? How are you doing Suku? Why did you frame me? I've come to save you right now. Ask the commissioner to do a test of the drug packet found at your place. And, raid Javed's house. Yes? Bye Suku. Madam can you please call the commissioner for a couple of minutes, I want to have a word with the commissioner for a couple of minutes. - Bhonsle! Court has sanctioned the order, - Sir? We have to raid Javed's house. Arrest Dharkar too, he was trying to teach me a lesson. He sure has drugs stocked at his house, we can surely nab him, - leave right away! - Right sir. Bhonsle! You better behave yourself! Did you find anything? You've found anything? Get out, security kick these cops out right away. I'll show you what Ajit Dharkar is capable of now. I'm called Dharkar. Woah, intense. AJIT, your Baby G got your C. Is he yours? Sir, this one is yours. - Let's go. - Let's go. Medicine. Let's go, no medicine, come on. Go there and die. Why were the drugs and gun found at your place? Sir, that girl, Suku, she's framing me, she got herself trapped in the drugs scandal, now she's framing me. You are the one framing her. The drugs packet found at her place had a mixture of inositol and baby powder, which is used as a film prop, it wasn't cocaine. This stuff was recovered from your house. You work for Ajit Dharkar, right? No Sir, what are you even talking about. Sir? Ma'am, my phone. [Suku dialing] "The number you're calling does not exist." "Please check the number you are calling" "The number you're calling does not exist." "Please check the number you are calling" Coming, wait, whose there? Ashadevi Waghmare family, where are they? Did they mention where they were going? No, I have no clue, they didn't say anything. No, they were leaving for somewhere but they didn't say anything. Vishnu, Vishnu. Why did you lie to the cops? We got the bungalow... dead body is missing so, why create problems for ourselves. He's murdered her, I'm just returning from his house, they all are missing. His mother, aunt, Kaustubh, everyone's missing. Do you have proof of it? No, right? Let it go, our work is done here. If they are missing, let them be missing. I've been putting up an act for the last three years Vishnu, you won't betray me right? You'll give me the flat and the money, right? I will surely give you, don't be scared, mother's promise. I'll give you one crore rupees and a 3-bedroom flat in Andheri, I have a huge deal with a builder. Have a seat, have a couple of drinks Listen Suku. Head home, have a couple of drinks and pass out peacefully. And, if you don't have booze on you, take some imported stuff from here - Finish all the remaining formalities. - Excuse me sir! This is a non-disputed residential property, we've got official paperwork. The legal owner Mr. Vishnu Vishwakarma is right here, why are you sealing the property sir? Bidye, an officer from the town planning commission raised a case against this property. In 1988 this property was illegally sold to some Gopi Vishwakarma, he had bribed the planning commissioned officer at that time. But, this is a school land and high court has handed over this piece of land to the BMC. And, only a school can built on this property now. All the family members of Gopi Vishwakarma have been notified about the same. Is that clear? Cleaning the letterbox is not a part of my job. This letter had come, check it. Have a look, this is the original plan, this land is a part of the reservation quota for an education institute. But we have original paperwork. You are the second party who have the original paperwork. Who else had come? Sir, this is the original paperwork I have. I had also explained them the same thing that the papers are fake. Because the town planning commissioner at that time had taken a bribe to change the plan. - Yes! - His junior officer had filed a P.I.L. Public Interest Litigation on the senior. After 30 years, last month the officer won that case. Now this piece of land is with the corporation. Asha Niwas never belonged to Gopi Vishwakarma at all. Understood? Baldev? Baldev Chadda? - Excuse me! - Yes? Where does Baldev Chadda sit? He left Mumbai sometime back! Left Mumbai? Yes! He won a lottery worth a crore rupees. Should we go out to eat post pack-up? Yes we'll go, it was a very hectic day! How much time more? I want to leave. More half an hour to go. Chinese? Yes, let's go post pack-up. Yes, I think in another 5 to 10 minutes we'll leave. Why are you leaning back? What? - I'm trying my level best An and Sir. - Yes? We've also appealed at the High Court. - Bidye, please tell him. - Don't drag Bidye in all this mess. I want all my money within a week with the interest. Son, we are trying are best. What Son? I'm not your son, sit back quietly. Why don't you keep my orange SUV, it's a big vehicle. Do I look like some beggar? Do I look like some beggar? Sorry, sorry. I drive an S-class okay. Pick up. Hello, hello. You also got a call? Yes, sent me flight tickets too. He told me he's got some information about Govinda. But who called? I don't know. Oh, Hello, oh, thank you, Holy mother, Vishnu brother? No Violence Vishnu brother sit down and have some juice. Please have a seat, Mr. Lowalowa? Juice! Pinacolada, it's really nice. Thank you. How are you Suku? Elder Mom, Everything good in life? How was the flight? Comfortable? Did you get the window seat? You were the one who called us. I was the one who called. You guys must have had so many questions, I thought I'm liable to answer all of them. So, once upon a time, when Gopi Vishwakarma and Asha Waghmare's wedding film scene's word got exposed at the court, I knew right at that point that the snitch was in the house. My first suspicion went on Manju, so, I started following her. There I saw her with you Suku, You were bribing her. I lost my senses at that moment, I was in shock. I thought you were really in love with me. So, then I started following you. I was feeling very guilty and extremely bad. Then I saw you with Vishnu, it really broke my heart. I cried my eyes out on that day. I was genuinely in love with you but you cheated on me. I had told you about my scuba diving session. - What diving? - Scuba diving. The first time Charu mummy and Vishnu visited the bungalow, right at that moment my mother knew that the bungalow is going to go away. She started putting up the paralysis act from that moment onwards. Mother! Oh wow, How are you witch? Oh we have two of them here. Suku you asked me, why did I remove my mother from the bungalow. This was the reason, so that no one is suspicious of her. My life was messed up from all 4 sides. And I knew that the BMC was going to take over the bungalow and I had Dharkar threatening me all the time. I had to do something about all this. - Mother! - Yes. Let's go. Then I had a killer idea. Mother, it's time to stand up! We took the idea to Kaustubh, He almost had a heart attack. - Kaustubh, we're sorry. - Kaustubh? Kaustubh, really sorry. After that we immediately left for the bungalow. To murder Gauri? Correct! To murder me. Gauri, open the door, I want to have a word urgently. What is so urgent? I don't wish to speak to you at all. Dear, listen to me, please! Listen. BMC is going to takeover the bungalow. We won't be getting a single penny, everything is going to end. Gauri, I think I have one last chance, I wish to give it a shot. If that shot hits on target then I'm telling you, we all will be completely sorted. Then, you can have your divorce too. You are in a hurry to get divorced? Me? You also are in a hurry, aren't you? You also have a boyfriend, that Ballu. He's not my boyfriend, I had taken a life insurance policy worth two crore from him, and you are the nominee. - Me? - Absolutely, I thought if something happens to me, you'd be able to take care of this drama queen of a mother-in-law. But she's absolutely fit. - Daughter, I knew from the start... - Mom, now stop all this, Don't act now! Tell me what's your plan? Mr. San deep Dharkar, namaste. Six pack Sandy, the fame is in the name. Hey Sandy, I'm sharing the location pin, come fast. I was waiting for him right there, I thought I'll make him unconscious and then steal the stuff But Sandy sir made my life simpler. I saw the stuff and called you. And before that he called me. Yes, yes. Done with your time pass, let's setup. We setup everything up as soon as possible. And, I was dead And, the moment you left Govya took me out and gave be the stuff. Oh mother. Why didn't you hold on to me? What if I'd be dead for real? Take care of this, now leave at once, right away. I mixed inositol and baby powder to make some fake stuff and filled it up in Sandy's packet. And my mother's paralysis act also helped us. Yes! While you were hiding the proof, mother was following you, The moment you left from the place, mother entered and the proof disappeared. Suku's duplicate house keys, you keep it with you. Okay! Mother reached your house with the keys, she opened the drawer, the stuff was in. Police personnel opened the drawer, the stuff was out. There is a lot of work and you are slightly elderly too. I won't be able to give more than fifteen hundred bucks. I won't be able manage in that much money. Can you get me some water? I've become old. Yes, I'll get it. There was only one danger left now, Javed sir. I knew that he had whopped me so bad for the gun, for the drugs he would have killed me. Mother sorted that out too. How did you frame Dharkar and Sandy? Sold their own stuff to them. San deep Dharkar, I've found your stuff, total of 750 grams. Get me five crore rupees and you can have it. And, you don't need to act smart, If your father gets any information about this, I'll send all your stuff to the narcotics department. AJIT, your baby B, got your C. I had to give Baldev his share, from the two crore rupees we got from the insurance cause that amount was in the cheque, remaining was all cash. Someday we should catch up and do some bang bang. Listen moron, this is our last meeting, we aren't going to meet after this. It took six hours to count Five crore rupees. Kaustubh, not five but seven crores. We got two crores from our sweet Vishnu as well, right? I won't leave you guys. First you need to catch us for that. Your divorce? It's complicated. Mom! Don't get scared, nothing is going to happen, just a little head spin and in two minutes you three will be, - Dead? - No Govya, not dead but unconscious. Suku, Suku, Suku, I used to love you with all my heart, and you? Betrayed me for money. You thought what's this doofus Waghmare capable of? Right? This Waghmare will go to the world's end for his mother. And, Vishnu brother, My mother never received the respect she deserved. All we had is that one bungalow and you greedy people came to take that away from us. Now you can keep that Bungalow for yourself. I never had any affection for that place. But, what was important for me was my mother's respect. If you would have given me that, I would have happily gift wrapped the bungalow and handed it over to you. Irrespective of that there is one thing I would have never given you, and, I've taken it out from the bungalow for my mother. So everybody, from the Waghmare family... GOODBYE!!
