Toei Company Ltd., Presents Do what you have to do. I'll leave it up to you. You have to keep your spirits up. All right? The doctor will be up to see him later. Thank you. I'm glad the operation went well. Why don't you rest? We'll sit with him. Yes, thank you. When he collapsed I thought it was all over. He's really lucky. They're even on the balcony. One more shot. We've been waiting for ten hours. You all say our boss is a yakuza but he's done more than anyone to keep the peace and fight drugs... He's a lot better than all those fat cat politicians. There she is. Let's go. Get out of the way. My condolences. How did the operation go? Please give him my blood. Thank you. It went better than we hoped. He doesn't need blood transfusions anymore. Go back and tell everyone he's all right. Will you give us a comment? How do you feel as the wife of Japan's biggest yakuza organization? Just like any ordinary housewife would. It's harder because we have 15 thousand mouths to feed. That's enough. Ma'am. With the boss in the hospital, we understand the police are going all out to disband the Sakanishi group. Mrs. Sakanishi... She's so cool. That must come from being an actress. She's just an expensive trophy wife. Excuse me. Sugiko, order lunch for me. I'll be right back. You have a customer. Ma'am. It's been a long time. You said it was a small shop, but it's not bad. When did you get out? You should have let me know. Sugiko Don't just stand there. Pay your respect to the boss's wife. Hello. Married? It's not like that. I'm his wife, Sugiko. Did you go by the office? There's a supermarket in its place. Everyone's gone now. Is he here? I want to see him. Boss! Your wife's here. Quiet! It's your wife. Hey... I was so close... I said, it's your wife. I got out of prison on January 6th. They let me go six months early for good behavior. I'm sorry to have caused you trouble. I'll make up for it eventually, so please sign these divorce papers. Go ahead, keep going. You're so good. Why won't you divorce me? I had the lawyer contact you many times. Keep going, honey. I'm almost there. Then we'll meet in court. Wait. Don't you get it? You're the one that ruined me. You keep out of this. I'm a laughing stock... married to a woman who shot me in the groin. If you want a divorce, go be a whore and bring me $100,000. You'll catch a cold. I'll kill you. Wait. Hey, you, go sell her to a brothel somewhere. She's not human. She has no feelings. What time is it? He called from Itami airport at three, so he'll be here soon. One of our young members is coming home. Itami... is he returning from abroad? You can say that. A trip common to those in our profession... courtesy of the government. He's a rival of mine. He's in love with her. He thinks of me as his mother... since he grew up in our house. He's special to you, too, isn't he since you don't have kids? I suppose so. Excuse me. He's here. I'll come see you tomorrow. Boss, Akamatsu has returned. I'm home. I'm sorry to have been gone for so long. Ma'am... It's good to have you back. You look well. I'm so glad. Take a couple of days to get used to things again. Then we'll celebrate your homecoming. Kobe and Osaka have changed in me last eight years. Don't get in trouble. This way. This place is really posh. Welcome back. Thank you. You haven't changed. Hey, Akamatsu. Good of you to come. Are you well rested? Yes... and thanks for the other day. Oh, do you remember Kiso? He's now the boss of the Joshinkai group. I'm Kiso. Hey, let's toast Akamatsu's return to society. What do you think of this office? I'm the first and only yakuza to have an office in the middle of the business district. Real estate takes time, but stock prices rise in seconds. With capital and information you can make a killing. Kiso is my right hand man. Why don't you join my group, too? Gambling and loansharking are old hat. Times have changed. I'll loan you the money. There's a small but nice office nearby you can rent. What's all this? I killed the first Joshinkai boss. He was your boss. That's water under the bridge. Kiso says he wants to be blood brothers with you. The war between the Sakanishi and Joshin groups had nothing to do with me. I want to live and prosper with society. That's the current philosophy of Joshinkai. All right, all right. Could you all leave? I want to talk to the boss alone. Boss... You're serious about this blood brother thing? Of course. Seventeen of our men were killed in that war. Many are still in prison. Both sides suffered casualties. Boss Sakanishi ordered an end to the hostilities so we can safely walk the streets. Do you still hold a grudge and mean to cause trouble? I won't if I'm not provoked. But there are 20,000 men in both groups. I can't vouch for how they all feel. I killed Kiso's boss. He must hate me Becoming blood brothers... that's a very serious matter. You're so naive. Becoming blood brothers is a contractual thing. Just think of it as a deal to your advantage. You're too old fashioned. Boss. Why don't you disband the Terada group? You can retire to a carefree life. What's that supposed to mean? You talk of contracts and deals... you're no different from a loan shark. You jerk! Keep out of this! Hey, Akamatsu. Try to understand. With the boss in the hospital, the Sakanishi group is vulnerable. At the next annual board meeting, I was going to recommend you take over the helms so you and I can see the group through this crisis. I know just how vulnerable we are. That's why I'm saying this. Boss, I think you're all wrong. Excuse me. Excuse me. Let me through. Boss. He hasn't changed. What are you going to do? I'm sorry, Kiso. Tell me the truth. Do you want Akamatsu dead? Of course not. Hmmm... is that how it is? That girl's stacked... Does she work here? She's new. She answered our ad, and wanted to work right away. She's a real looker. She's the best looking girl in this club. Call her over. No. We have to be fair to our other customers. Spoken like a true owner, Ma'am. Unfortunately, the chief stockholder is nasty. We may be married but business is business. Hear that? Pour me a drink, will you? Are they regulars? I'm new here. What do you do? What do you think? A stockbroker. You couldn't afford to come here otherwise. Don't you think Ma'am is acting funny? She must be tired. She's gone to many temples to pray for his recovery. Is that true? Maybe the boss is really ill. Oh good, good. You've been at it for over an hour. I'm fine. You're good at this. Her mother works, so she's mostly alone. Akamatsu hasn't stopped by today, He must be busy, meeting everyone. You know... Terada said... Yes? He said Akamatsu is getting too big for his britches. We can't have trouble. How about marrying him off? You know, Tetsu... Sakanishi only has about a year to live. I thought he was getting better. It's too far advanced. They just closed him up again. Why don't we change hospitals? If we do, everyone will know. We've known Dr. Ihara forever. Besides, he's the best heart specialist in Japan. Isn't there any way we can save him? Tetsu... you have to be strong. I couldn't keep it a secret. That's why I told you. Oh, hi. I need to relax. She's my best friend from our showgirl days. We used to do this. Can you believe it? Stop it, you're embarrassing me. Welcome. I'll take that. Misato, this is Akamatsu Tetsuro, as promised. I'm so glad. Hi, I'm Misato. This way, please. Sit down, Tetsu. Misato's a strange one. She's interested in the yakuza. I'm a great fan of yours, Auntie Hazuki. Despite opposition from all, you chose this way of life yet you always manage to be so beautiful. You've become rather imposing, too. Hey, bad joke. Did you know that Mr. Sakanishi went to her show every day for two months? I'm glad he's better, Hazuki. He's going home soon, isn't he? Welcome. Excuse me. Isn't she nice? She's cheerful but very level-headed. If you're to get ahead, you must have a family. We never had children. That's our one regret. Oh, and Tetsu, you've got to be civil to Terada. He and Sakanishi go way back and they're blood brothers. I understand. I'm sorry to have worried you. That's all I have to say. Stay and enjoy yourself. I'll take you home. No, don't bother. Misato, take good care of him. Going so soon? You'd never guess, but Sakanishi is the jealous type. Here you go. Hazuki... what are you planning for my daughter? The same fate as yours? Would you hate me if that happened? Of course. You've changed. Scary, even. Bye now. Mr. Akamatsu. Thank you. Welcome back Welcome back, Ma'am. Is the boss asleep? No... he's still up. Excuse me. She fell asleep playing. Did you play with her till she fell asleep? You really should rest. I'll take her without waking her up. Ma'am, I'll do it. It's all right. Just take that. Hazuki. This is the first time I've seen you carrying a child. I'll be back soon. I'll make the bed. That's good. Akamatsu. Sorry to interrupt. But I thought I'd catch you here. What do you want? Have a seat. Hey, make him a drink. Boss, I'm sorry. I was rude, the other day. Oh, that. But what gives? This isn't like you. I thought it over real good. I'm very sorry. What? Hey, stop. You can take half. Give the rest to Kiyomi at Scandal. She's my sister. Why me? Please. There's no one else. I'll do whatever you say, as if you were my boss. Is that so? Now that you've come around, I won't make life difficult for you. We don't need to rush things with Kiso. Telephone, sir. It's me. What? What? The boss is dead? All right. I'll be right there. That was Ma'am. The boss died suddenly an hour ago. Akamatsu. I'm avenging my boss. Ouch. Don't. You'll make it bleed more. Is it serious? Nothing serious. Is everyone all right? Are you all right boss? You planned this. You came to take me off my guard. No. He was after me. Boss. You're talking nonsense. I have to go to him. He must be lonely. Wait a minute. Ma'am? What happened? Why did he go so suddenly? Open your eyes. Boss. Open your eyes. Since Urushibata's organizing the funeral, the next boss must be Terada. No, Ma'am is backing Akamatsu. He's the most active the Sakanishi group. There's going to be trouble. With the sudden passing of the boss, I am honored that Ma'am has asked me to be acting boss. The Sakanishi group has never been this vulnerable. The police have declared that they will do their best to disband the group now that the boss is gone. The board must unite to keep our group going. I ask you to help us through this crisis. First new business is the matter of new members. Joshinkai's Kiso and Yajinto's Nonomura, are both sponsored by Terada. I don't think I need to go into their histories. Any objection to their joining the board? No objection. Wait a minute. Yes, Awa? Only members of Sakanishi's group or affiliated groups are eligible for board membership. These two don't qualify. They're both affiliated with Terada. That makes them indirectly affiliated and since the leadership has changed, I see no problem. No, it hasn't. Let me explain. I sponsored Kiso because of his business acumen. We need people like him in our organization. Nonomura is our liaison to the groups in the Kanto. He's also affiliated with Doshukai. Both men are aligned with you. What? Awa, can't you obey the acting boss? I'm just stating my opinion. Are you all satisfied? No, I'm opposed. Let's move this along. Call for a vote. Akamatsu, say something. You must have something to say. Chairman, let's put this to a vote. I call for a vote. Those in favor, raise your hands. The vote carries by a majority. Thank you. The funeral cost $800,000 and we received $7.3 million in offerings. It was a group funeral so the balance will go into the group's treasury. What about his estate? The accountant is handling the paperwork. I see. This is awkward, but this house belongs to the group. So, we're offering you a condo, a lump sum bonus and a monthly stipend of $20,000 for ten years. All right. I'll accept my husband's bonus but I'll find my own place to live. You can divide the $20,000 among his mistresses. I hear there are five of them, some with children. I didn't know you knew, Ma'am. I am staying here until after his 49 day observance. That's fine. Did the boss say anything before he died? No... It was so sudden. Then the board will choose the new boss and you'll approve the choice. That's fine. But that should also be after the 49 day observance. I understand. Hotel living is not so bad. What's wrong? You looked stunned. This was his favorite wine. Do you want some? No. Oh, have some. Just for today, I want to be gay, drink some wine... I feel like a bird or butterfly... feel so good. Sorry. Are you all right? I'm so sorry you had to go through all that. I'll go talk to Terada's rep. Your husband built that house... I don't care. I'm really relieved. It's as though 20 years of worry has disappeared. Ma'am. You must be tired. Why don't you go on a trip abroad? I'll go with you. Really? People will talk. You and your husband brought me up. I don't care what anyone says. I'm prepared to leave the business anytime. Maybe we should go. I think that's better. No one will know about me. I can live a normal life. Tetsu? Will you make love to me? Right here. Right now. I won't be able to ask you tomorrow. I can say what I feel right now. Don't you like me? I like you. What's the matter? I'm a woman, after all. Tetsu. You're a man, aren't you? Tetsu... you're all that I have left. Excuse me. I'm sorry. Can you give me a few days? I'll fix everything. Tetsu, it's all right. Now that I know how you feel, I don't feel lonely anymore. Ma'am, are you making fun of me? Think what you will. Sakanishi loved Osaka. He said Osaka has the will to survive. That's why it eats up everything good or bad. Sakanishi was like that. You're the only one who can inherit his spirit. You're willing to throw all that way for me? Why not? You're always thinking of yourself. There's no turning back now. No, Tetsu. You mustn't. Tetsu... It has to remain a dream. Ma'am, there's a safe deposit key inside this envelop. The box contains Mr. Sakanishi's will. Will? He called me right after he went into the hospital. He gave one this and asked me to keep it for you. He was concerned about you most of all. He once told me it was as if he had taken a hothouse flower and replanted it in a wasteland. He thought maybe you resented him. He said... that? What are you going to do about the will? It probably mentions his wish for a successor. Why would he leave this to me? You inherit the spirit of your late husband. You have to make sure his last wishes are honored. Ma'am? Could you keep this a while longer? Of course, but why don't you take a look? No, it's better I know nothing... Until the time comes... Take your clothes off. I'll wash your body. You're Kiyomi? I'm a messenger from your brother. He's waiting for you. Sit down. Where's my brother? Is this your brother's? Where is he? He's wanted by the police. Come home with me. I'll talk to your boss. Don't worry. The Sakanishi boss is a friend of mine. What do you want? Terada's throwing money around to get enough votes. Campaigning for votes? Yes. We don't have enough votes to win. If we want this, now's our only chance. We get Ma'am behind us, sever ties with Terada, and take control of the Sakanishi group by force. Why do we have to go through all this trouble? We want you to be the new boss. Are you serious? Make up your mind. If Terada becomes boss, those who followed you will be iced out. It's not just the money. Hiring Kiso proves he has deep ties to the Kanto groups. That fool only thinks of the Sakanishi title as a means of making money. Enough. Brother! If everyone's happy with Terada, so be it. It is life and death question for us. I'm perfectly willing to kill him. Even if I get ten years, it'll be worth it if I become boss. What is it? You have a guest... a young lady. Bring her through. She's my date. We're not finished. Yes, we are. Please sit down. Goodbye. We'll come by again. Tell him to think it over, real good. Who are you? Name's Nogata. At the club, I was with the guy who shot at you. I gather he hasn't been caught? I know who he really is. Who do you want? A loan of $100,000. It's alimony for my husband. He was a boss of a group but while he was losing influence to Sakanishi, he kept playing around, so I got mad and ambushed him. The shot got deflected by a bone in his leg and gazed his groin. I got 2 and half years for that but my husband won't give me a divorce. What do you think? Yes? I've brought some refreshments. Please help yourself. Have fun. My, my. What hospitality. We have so few women visitors. Please. I won't go a cent lower. What? You mean that shooter is from Joshinkai? His name's Matsue Katsumi, from Joshinkai. I got it from his woman. Where is he... this Matsue. The police will find him. I want you to expel Kiso from the board. You suspect him? If this gets out, they'll be trouble... especially from my group. All right. I'll discuss this with Kojima. I want Nonomura out, too. Let's take the board back to square one. By the way, I want you to be fair with assignments. Meaning you want to be the young boss? No. Awa should be the young boss. Awa? The younger members trust him. Akamatsu, what do you want? Spell it out. Nothing. I just want you to sleep safely in your bed. That's all. We have with us today, Doshukai's Urushibata, Ikezono of Ikezonokai and Honbashi from Kyoto, here at Ma'am's reception. As acting head of the Sakanishi group, I am honored by their presence. Ma'am, please accept the service bonus and a token from the group. Thank you. Thank you for coming, everyone. What are you going to do? You must come to me if you need help. I'm going home to Seto Island. To Sakanishi's home? The house is still standing empty. I see. Don't you have family? My parents died when I was young. That's sad. We'll stop by to see you from time to time. Hey, we can build a health complex there if you like. Hey, hey, this isn't the time. Oops excuse me. Let's toast. Ma'am's continued beauty and health. Thank you. Here we go. Look this way. That's it. I'd like a picture with you alone. Akamatsu, could you take our picture? Where's a good spot. Come, boss. Come closer. Your late husband will be jealous. Do you think she'll be happy on a small island? She's still young and beautiful... We should watch her and Akamatsu. Not possible. No, I'm not talking about that. Chairman. You remembered. What were you saying? Do you think Ma'am will back Akamatsu? Sentimentally, yes. But she knows it's just not done. Is Kiso here? He's waiting in the lobby. Bring him here. I'll be going to the island at the beginning of the month. I'll go with you. Forget about that night. No. You were drunk, but I was dead serious. Well, the party was a success. I can't believe everyone came just for me. It just shows the respect your husband had. When the family head us great, invariable the children squabble for succession but are you happy with Terada's succession? Yes. That club incident... Your story doesn't check out. He's just a drug addict. He went to Joshinkai's office in Shizuoka said he had avenged the former boss and asked for money. Hey, Kiso, what happened to that drug addict? You mean the man who shot at Akamatsu? Our people told him to go to the police but he fled. That's the truth of the matter. You win. What a sorry guy... to get killed by his own people for doing their bidding. Serves him right for giving off his sister. Are you looking after her? She's a nice kid. Very naive for someone in that business. Thanks. Kiyomi, is it? Don't you want to avenge your brother? There's some sushi in the fridge. Have some. I think I'll go to the bathhouse. Could you buy some milk? How could you? We're responsible for her brother's death. Why did you come to me with this? You'd have made more money off Terada. He's not my type. Now you, I like. Here's your money. Are you sure? It's a promise. Thank you. How about investing that money? Invest? That club is up for sale. It's $500,000. Cheap, huh? But it's Terada's property. Right. Are you looking for a fight? I'll call you later. I have a question. Is it true you're cold to women because you're in love with Mrs. Sakanishi? Don't be stupid. When I was in prison, I swore that the first man I'd sleep with when I got out would be first rate. This is strictly personal. Won't you? I won't ask you to marry me. We'll save the best for last. How dare you. And you call yourself a man? You impotent fool. What're you gonna do with all this junk? That's right. This ain't an archaeological dig. I'll arrest you for interference. That's a piranha. It'll bite your hand off. We found it. Did the piranhas make these guns? Awa, I'm arresting you for possession of forearms. There fish coast $100 a piece. What're you gonna do about it? They did us, too. They had a bogus search warrant but they were looking for guns. I hear Terada's the informant. Awa really was going to kill Terada. Are you going to remain silent after this? Where is the old you? You're the only one we can rely on. This is so big. I like it. So this is where it happened. Hey, there's blood. We'll have to redecorate the entire place. How much did you say you wanted? $500,000 although it's worth $700,000. Fine I'll leave you a $100,000 deposit. You? It's a bank check. I'll pay the rest when we sign the contract. Fine. Let's go to the office. This way. Here we are. I feel great. Like we're big real estate developers. We had to redo the entire thing. I tried to save but it cost $300,000. It was so expensive. Hey, I read about you in a magazine. It says you've got a good chance of being the next boss of the Sakanishi group. If that happens, you can get as much money as you want. Hey, are you listening? Don't worry about the money. I'll make sure we get a lot of customers. I'll do my best to make money and help you... as though I were your wife. Oh, great. I made it. I hear you're leaving right after the party. If I dally, I'll never leave. So I thought I'd wait for my things to arrive there. Did you want to talk to me? It's about the voting for the succession. I want to get on it right away. As you know, things are dicey within the group. We need to have a new leader, whoever that is, or thing will remain unsettled. Are candidates standing for the office? No, we'll let the board decide. Then you're a shoot-in. You can never tell with elections. I hope it's a unanimous decision. If not, people might harbor grudges. Well, that's true. Tell me the truth. You want to see Akamatsu elected. He told me he was quitting the yakuza business. Is that true? Sakanishi's death must have really affected him. That's not possible. Akamatsu is a yakuza through and through. After going to prison for almost ten years, he knows he's owned his due. Do you think so, too? Yes, he's a strategist, that one. In any case, I don't want the succession to be messy. I'm sure my husband would feel the same way. I can't promise it will be unanimous. I can talk to Akamatsu, if you like. Oh, really, Ma'am? But I want the election to be after Sakanishi's buried. I won't have any obligations, then. All right. I won't see you off, but travel safe. Thank you. It's going to be so lonely without you. Stop, Yoshimi. You said you won't cry. But when I saw her face, I... You'll come and visit often, won't you? Yes, do. Otherwise, I don't know what my husband will get up to. What's an affair or two? The late boss had many mistresses, right? You didn't mind? Even now, she's sending them money, taking care of them. If you're a yakuza's wife, an affair should be the least of your problems. It's better than a funeral. Misato, the bottle's empty. All right. Hazuki, why don't you sing? Don't joke. I want to hear. A record company wanted to put her under contract. I'll sing, then. Don't go overboard. Misato are you seeing Akamatsu? He says he's busy. He's good looking, isn't he? Yes, I like him. But he only has eyes for you. She's smart. I'm relieved. It's Mrs. Awa. I'm sorry I'm late. Sit here. I'm surprised you could come. Unlike you, I'm used to my husband going to prison. It's probably not serious, but keep your chin up. Tomomi, drink up. What now? You, too. To your health. Delicious. I want another. Hey, don't overdo it. Oh by the way, did you hear? About the club. Who cares. It's bad luck anyway. It's reopening tonight. The proprietor is Akamatsu's girlfriend. What? Is that true? I hear she's a knockout. Is Akamatsu her financial backer? He must be. Let's go over there. It'll be fun. Won't you all come? Let's go. What's that mean? It means a tattoo of roses. Thanks to you, we topped our projected take for our first night. You, too, Kiyomi. Thank you. Prepare to close. I'm sorry. We're closed. We're here to celebrate the opening. What a gaudy club. Who are you? Are you the proprietor? Yes, that's right. I'm Sakanishi Hazuki. What do you want? I heard this was our Akamatsu's club, so I came to take a look. It's such a gaudy place. I must tell Akamatsu not to waste his money. I'm the owner. It's got nothing to do with him. You sound as though you know him well. What do you want? How much? I'll buy this club. I can't have Akamatsu taking a loss. If I refuse? Do you think Akamatsu will defy me? Why don't you come out and say you're jealous? I bet you're in love with him, too. Listen good. Our love is a question of life and death. If you're a yakuza's woman, you should be prepared for the consequences. Ma'am, what would it take for me to keep this club? This club is more important than life itself. Please. I beg you. Please let me continue this club. Get up. I'll send my rep over tomorrow. You can name your own price. Let's go. Get out of the way. What are you looking at? Hey, don't do that. You punk... I'll take you on. Make sure she sends me the bill. I hear Terada won the voting. How many votes did you get? It was 19 to 5. I bombed. So it wasn't unanimous. Tetsu, you came to say goodbye to me, didn't you? Ma'am, I'll never show my face again. You're not getting hitched with her? That woman from the Rose Tattoo... are you? She's officially divorced. Do you love her? She's just my speed. She's quite a gal. Pretty and gutsy. But I don't like her. She's not suited to be a Sakanishi boss's wife. $2 million, $3 million... I didn't count. That's all I have. You can have it. I can't take it. I can make money on my own. You're going to fight Terada, aren't you? Don't you think I know what you're thinking? If you're going to be a yakuza, you have to aim for the top. It's me. It'll be a while yet. Don't botch it. Oh, Mr. Akamatsu. What are you doing here? Where is she? Playing golf with a customer. It's Sunday and the club's closed so she'll be out late. The club's really busy. She's such a go-getter. Excuse me. I'll make you some tea. No. Don't, Mr. Akamatsu. Stop. Please stop. Please stop. No. Stop. No... she'll be mad with me. She'll be.... Please... Are you ready? Go back. Get out of the way. Clear the way. Back up. You back up. You're close to the intersection. Hey, stop it. Oh, Toki... What? Kiso was shot? Okay. Don't panic. I'll send Kojima. Kiso's dead. It was one of Akamatsu's assassins. Kojima, go to the office at once. Call Nonomura. This is war. Get the weapons out. Where's the phone? Nonomura, it's me. Akamatsu has declared war on us. Why? Why me? I told you I love you. I'm starving. Kobayashi and Ueno of Joshinkai were arrested and the police also arrested Akamatsu Tetsuro, Sakanishi group's executive as the main suspect in the murder of Joshinkai's chairman. This is terrible. Mr. Akamatsu has been arrested. What should I do? He'll need a change of clothes. I'm going to the police station. I'll go, too. I'm from the police. Is Matsue Kiyomi here? That's me. I have a few questions. What is it? Are you Nogata? You're a friend or Akamatsu? We'd like to have a word with you, too. I want to know where you were yesterday. I was here. You have to tell the truth. It's true. Do you know Akamatsu? He says he was in bed with you since noon yesterday. Kiyomi, is that true? Were you with him? Be truthful, now. Yes. Kiyomi. Why didn't you tell me? Hey, stop that. Stop that. From when to when? Before noon till the evening. Is that true? Yes. You good for nothing. He was just toying with you. Why would he be serious about a whore like you? You stupid fool. Go jump off a bridge. Get out. Get out. Ma'am. Thank you so much for coming. What's this urgent matter? I hope it isn't about Akamatsu. We held a board meeting this morning and we expelled him by a majority vote. Expulsion? He killed a board member, so there's no excuse. But he didn't know anything about that. In any case, it was his responsibility. It can't be helped if that's the board's decision but what if he's the new boss? That's not funny. He no longer has the right to that position. I hate to say this but we found Sakanishi's will. Ma'am? A will? You mean the late boss's will? Yes, I had a call from our lawyer saying he was in possession of Sakanishi's will. I bet it contains his wish for his successor. He must have written it in the hospital. That's a bunch of bull. You knew from the beginning. You kept quiet because you wanted Akamatsu to succeed. If I knew, I'd told you long ago. I'm just as surprised as you are. Lies. You scheming woman. You're truly frightening. I told you that widow was dangerous. She got me all right. She must be quite a woman if Sakanishi fell for her. What will you do if the will names Akamatsu? I'll have no choice but to break ties with Sakanishi. I hope you'll back me when the time comes. That's my intention. If this was a while back, we'd taken care of it a lot quicker. Akamatsu killed Kiso. What other excuse do you need? I didn't think I'd ever see you again. You heard about the will? This changes things. When you get out, lie low in Tennoji. Terada's hopping mad. I can deal with it. Tetsu... this is war. Yours and mine. Cherry blossoms are in bloom on the island. But now I've got to come live in a hotel. Take care of yourself. If you die, I won't bother to stay alive. Yes, thanks. You haven't been here since the opening. That was a month ago. Welcome home. You look well. The club's doing great. That's because I work hard at it. Kiyomi's disappeared. I took such care of her, but I guess you can't trust her kind. Don't you know where she is? In some rat hole or other. Will you come home or would you prefer a hotel? I won't let you out of my sight tonight. We're free to do as we please. I'm selling this club. I'll make sure you won't starve. You mean the Rose Tattoo? You're joking. It's a bad one, too. We're through, too. Wait. Why, all of a sudden? I'm tired of you. But you said you'd marry me. Engagement's annulled. I get it. It's her. Sakanishi's widow. This is her idea. I'm in love with Kiyomi. Kiyomi? That's a joke. You're not yourself. That woman's controlling you. What are you to her? What? Her slave? If that's what you want to think. Ma'am. Ma'am. What's wrong? You... you... you... Hitoshi. I want you to kill Akamatsu. What? It's a joke. It's a joke. Ma'am. You're so drunk. Why'd you get so drunk? Akamatsu left me. He took my club, too. That can't be right. It's that woman. She ruined everything. I'm not going to take this sitting down. Hitoshi, you like me, don't you? Of course... but... Then make me forget everything. Oh, Ma'am. Oh, boss. It's all right. Don't worry. There's no mistake? You're pregnant? Although I was in that line of work, I never once sold myself. Congratulations. Ouch. Kiyomi. Ouch. Hey... Hey there. Hey you. Someone, help this woman. Hey. You there. Someone, help this woman. Help this woman. Take her to the hospital, please. Akamatsu. Where's our Akamatsu? Through there. Akamatsu. Where's Akamatsu? Ma'am. Over here, Ma'am. Wait. It's Sakanishi's widow. Ma'am. Akamatsu! He said to tell you sorry. He said the top was too high. Why? What happened? I don't know either. But why? Who's this woman? I don't know. I want an answer. He was shot when he was with her. What? But even we don't know who she is. Tetsu. You were supposed to lead the Sakanishi group. You were supposed to be the greatest boss in Japan. Why? Why did you have to die? You fool. Tetsu. What do you have to say? Tetsu. What can you say to me now? This is the last will of Sakanishi Takeo. I authorize my wife Hazuki to dispose my estate as she sees fit. As regarding my successor, I name Terada as the next boss of the Sakanishi group. My wish is that Akamatsu be named his assistant and hope that Terada will educate and guide him so that he may become a truly exemplary being. As you can see, it is in his own handwriting. To avoid confusion, he left the will in my hands, keeping it a secret from everybody, even his wife. Ma'am, please accept this will. Terada, everyone, I'm sorry to say that the situation has changed since he wrote this will. Therefore, I will consider this null and void. Ma'am. Akamatsu. I don't know what you did but you killed Akamatsu. There's an old saying, when the hen crows, the house will fall. You ruined everything. Do you know that? Thank you. Here she is. Who's the successor, Ma'am? Who's the new boss? There was no stipulation. So what happens now? I'll act in his name for the time being. I hear the group is splitting up. How about disbandment? We will not disband. Sakanishi always said there's light and dark to everything. Same goes for men. Someone has to lead the 15,000 men and their families, feed them... or there'll be hell to pay. From now on, you're the target. Remember that. One more word please. We understand, the police acknowledge you as the head of the Sakanishi group and vow to use even stronger measures to destroy the group.
