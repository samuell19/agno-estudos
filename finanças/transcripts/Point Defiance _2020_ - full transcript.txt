Yes Marsha Webb, she's been missing about a year. I don't know how I could help. We're just canvassing door to door, trying to get the word out. Yeah there's not a lot of doors out here where you are. It's pretty isolated actually. Yes. Nice and quiet. Yeah, I mean, not really no Your wife around? Excuse me? Are you married? No, no. It's a lot of space just for one man. Yeah. If you have or come across any information regarding Miss Webb the number is right there. Or you can call me here, this is my personal line. Great. What the hell? Jesus Christ. Alex what the hell are you doing? Alex? I'm cleaning up. It's midnight. Go to bed Peter. I said go to bed. No. No. Did you read the paper this morning?

I'm just trying to make conversation. Why don't we talk about your shit then? Like what? Like what do you do all day with yourself? I work. You call it work? What the hell's that supposed to mean? It means you trade on other peoples shit right? It's bit more complicated than that. Yeah sure, there's companies, corporations. But somewhere in there are people who really work, really grind it out to put food on their table and dress their kids. And you don't think what I do is a job. I call it more of a racket. So you think you know what I do. I think I got a pretty good idea. I see you, you sit behind the screen, no face no name. And you bet. And you gamble on which way the world's gonna spin, and burn, and spin and burn. Jesus Christ man, guys like you... Guys like me? Guys like you who don't know fuck all about work, or anything real. I think I get it. Guys like you, you got it all figured out right? No, we ain't got it all figured out. We just is. Oh that's deep, that's really deep. I'm glad you found your purpose. Cops where here checking on you? No. What's up with that bitch bracelet on your ankle bro? Just don't want to come clean. That's funny because I've been thinking a lot about something recently. Good for you. About Redemption, There's a concept for you right? To be saved from the evils that we have committed. I know what it means. I don't think you do. I mean you go through all the motions pretending to be sorry. What the fuck are we talking about? Sin! Redemption. But, you have to truly understand the nature of your crimes in order to atone for them, see dad taught me that one. Did he now? He'd have his moments. He used to call it sins of the father. It was evil passed down from generations, at least that's what he used to call it when he was laying into me. You ever hear that one? Maybe. You got a lot of him in you, you know? That's why you don't wanna drink right? But you don't want to look in the mirror either. That's one of the mom things, she could never face facts. You sound fucking nuts you know that? I just been through the crucible out there in the desert. You feel me? This is where you start telling me some of your war stories or what? No, no no no no No see, the desert? that's about purification. Out there in the fire and the dust, it shows you what you really are good, bad. It's all the same really. Just a shame you couldn't see it. Oh it's a real shame. You're not gonna find purity in this big ass house, and that bitch ass job. Okay you know what? Fuck you. Go ahead and walk away that's your bag right brother? I don't have time to deal with whatever bullshit trip you're on, you got it. What'd you do Peter? What'd you do? Nothing. Can we leave it at nothing? Nothing? Sounds like you're already knee deep in the big D right? That river in Egypt, de Nile. Go fuck yourself. It's a powerful thing. It's a dangerous thing. D-Ni-Le. Hey brother, what's going on man? What time is it there? I can even keep track of the time difference anymore man. Doesn't matter, but yeah man live and direct from Afghanistan. What the fuck? Made it, yeah man this place is fucking crazy. It's hot as hell during the day man but it's really really really cold at night man. You freeze your balls off. It's like being on the moon or some other planet or some shit but you know, whatever. Here with some really good guys, guys that have got your back and shit, I know that. Haven't seen anything yet but I know I will, I know I will. And you know I'm not scared, you know, not at all. Because I'm here for a purpose you know. To defend our honor, defend our freedom, just kick it right back to these motherfuckers. I just wanna make you proud so you can look at me and say hey that's my little brother man he's a good soldier. But yeah so. That's about it, I guess I'll check up on you later alright. Love you man, hope all is well. Late last night authorities discovering an abandoned vehicle off a back road in the Point Defiance area which they now believe to be linked to missing person Marsha Webb. Police are asking anyone with information regarding the vehicle or Marsha Webb to please step forward. This marks the first real lead in the case of the missing woman in the last 12 months. So what am I looking at? It's her, Crystal she's Marsha Webb, the same girl who was here two nights ago. So what do you get a prize or something? She's been missing for over a year, that's why the cops came by. They knew she was here? No. I don't know I mean they, they said that they were just spreading the word around. But they found her car Alex. But no Crystal or Marsha whoever? You said she left later that night. Yeah so what? Well you guys were drinking maybe, maybe she ran her car off the road. Well maybe she did but what's that got to do with us? Don't you think we should go to them with that information? To the cops? - Yes. - No. Wait we don't even know if Crystal's that girl. It's her Alex. Okay so what if it is? So some little slut runs off to play big city hooker. That shit happens all the time. Hey, what if she don't want to be found? You ever think of that? That's bullshit and you know it. So you're just gonna tell the cops hey me and my brother ordered this whore off the internet. She sold us a bunch of coke and then we fucked her silly. You did. I did what. You called her, you did those things, not me. So you just give him the intel and they're like cool and move on? You don't have to be involved. No no, no no no I am involved. And you're not going to the cops. I just think that we need to call them. I said no fucking way! What the fuck is wrong with you? You can't tell them I was here. Why? Because I'm in trouble Peter. What are you AWOL or something? Jesus Christ what happened? A series of unfortunate events, cluster fucks, bad decisions, what the fuck does it matter? The whole point is I can't go back there ever. Alex. Peter, I just need some place to get right. What are you gonna do? I don't know. But this shit here, this needs to go the fuck away. Mr. Allen, Got a few minutes? Sure. Was it a good party? Excuse me? Oh, no I'm just cleaning up. What can I do for you? This is a bad time. It's fine. The reason we're back, the car they found out here in a ditch, you hear about it? On the news yes? It belonged to Marsha Webb. The missing girl from the flyer you gave me. That's right. Wondering if you know anything about that. I'm sorry? Car found less than three miles from your house. The only house out here on the point. Strange coincidence right? I guess. Well maybe you could have seen something. Like seen her car? Did you? Mr. Allen? No, no. Well we think that somebody drove her car out here and dumped it. Really? Car was cleaned out too. And I mean wipe down. You know she was a party girl right? A what? We have reason to believe that Miss Webb was an escort, using online dating services to solicit clients. Yeah you know a pro, you know what that means. Yes I know what that means. Yeah you do don't you? When was the last time you left the house Mr. Allen? A year ago. That's a long time. You can get a bit lonely right? I don't know what you're implying. Some guys do a stretch at home, they need the company. Not me. It can make them a little crazy too. You know what I'm saying? No, I don't do those things. Let's just say you did, we're not judging you. You got a car? What? A car? Yeah in the garage. But you don't take it out? No, I mean I can't. That's a a fresh oil stain. Looks like someone parked here very recently. I get groceries delivered, I mean maybe the truck. Sure. Groceries. Look I didn't take Marsha Webb's car anywhere if that's what you're asking me. Yeah it'd be kind of hard with that thing on. So is anyone else here with you at the house? I said I was alone. Alright, you mind telling me what that's for then? Yes I do mind. Alright. Well can you answer this question for me then? Was Marsha Webb here at your house in the last couple of days? No, no she wasn't. Alright. Fair enough. Oh, One thing the news didn't say, Mr. Allen, person who cleaned up that car was trying to wipe down blood, they didn't get it all. Makes you wonder what really happened to her. Hey you did good out there man. They bought what you were selling, I don't think they're gonna bother you anymore. About what exactly? We should talk, sit down. Okay. Talk about what? Mexico. What? I think it's a good plan man for both of us. Are you serious? Aren't you? I mean what the fuck's keeping either one of us here? Down there man they got beaches man, solid brown pussy, the good shit. This isn't a joke Alex. It's not a joke man, it's a good fucking plan. I don't need a plan. Is that why you're moving all your money around? What do you know about my money? I'm just saying. No listen to me, are you going through my shit? What are you doing? Oh my fucking God. Stop being a whiny little bitch alright. You gonna watch the world fucking pass you by on a screen? Christ, Alex I'm not talking about Mexico. I need a reboot big brother, so do you. You tell me that she's okay Alex. Tell you who's okay? They found blood in her car in Crystal, in Marsha Webb's car. Oh you're still fucking talking about that man. I told you the bitch left. She was three sheets to the fucking wind. She probably fell into a ditch, crawled back to her pimp. Who the fuck cares? It's a good plan. We could both use a fresh start. Hey man, I'm just checking in. I was out of pocket there for a little bit but I'm back now. Or at least I think I'm back. Hey you know what I mean? I guess you wouldn't. There's a lot they don't tell you about this place. You know? Stuff you can encounter, that you're gonna see. Things you're gonna have to do. See the other guys around here, you see them and you know they're taking their turn out there. They don't come back the same. You know you can see it in their eyes. They're different. It's like you become a different person after, after you do those things that you had to do. And you know you're gonna keep seeing those things. You know when you close your eyes at night right. So you try and become that hard thing, and it works, you know at least for a while. So you think you don't feel it anymore, but Then there's the old you right. And he's trying to be cool with it man but he's not. So now you gotta accept that there's two of you in there, the person you were before you had to kill, and the thing you are now. Before. After. Before and after. Before. After. Hello? Anyone here? What you got there? Alex, what is this? What's what? This. Oh, yeah man I get these fucking nosebleeds from the desert, that shit fucks you... This isn't a fucking nosebleed Alex. Whatever you say. Did you put these out here? I don't want to fuck up the laundry dude. Is this her blood? Who? You know goddamn well who. Is this hers? What do you want to hear man? She was on the rag or some shit? I've had enough of this shit. Where the fuck do you think you're going brother? What are you doing? I'm done man, done. Done with what? Look if you don't want to level with me that's fine. You can tell it to the cops. Tell them what? The fucking games you're playing with me. What have you been doing in the woods? Huh? Okay we can talk to the cops. I told you very clearly no fucking cops. What did you do to her Alex? You crazy fuck. You don't want to go down this road with me Peter. Fuck you. It only takes an inch to let the jugular go full tilt, and bleed you all the way out. The way your hearts pumping now, I'd say three minutes. I've seen it happen. But I'd rather you consider all the variables of the situation. You might not want to go blabbing to the cops, because guess what? I'm not the one who fucked Crystal What's Her Name, you did. I never touched her. Well I don't remember too much about the night but I do believe that love was in the air. You tore that shit up, good for you. I went to bed. That's right you had booze, you blacked the fuck out. Well at least it sounded like you had fun. Fuck you. I never drink. Fine, don't believe me. But Big Brother's always watching Peter, always. Hey, dinner's on me tonight okay. I'm gonna go take a shower, wash your fucking hands. You ain't hungry? No. No? I don't cook it right or something? I'm just not hungry. What's up with you? You look like you seen a ghost, some shit. See something you didn't like? Told you. They eye in the sky don't lie. You know what I found, the other day about the barn? You kept dad's piece. Sneaky bastard. See when you took off, oh I'm sorry, ran the fuck away. I always wondered if you took dad's piece. It was probably good thing because he'd have shot my ass that day. You kept it oiled, and loaded. Funny ain't it? You're all Mr. Security up in here but you keep the gun all the way out there. Some confusing shit man. See I know why you kept it out there. You know why? 'Cause you know how easy it'd be to put it in your mouth, pull the trigger. I can see it in your eyes. It's right there. Am I right? What the fuck do you want from me? Some fucking honesty man. You think you can do that? You know how much you owe me? Huh? Like have you really quantified it in that being fucking counting brain of yours? All those years ago, You took off, left me behind to take all that weight huh? I never meant to... Stop. Know thyself. Isn't that what they say in the AA or some shit? Go on. Make it a lot easier. You know the old man he had another piece shortly after you left. And this time he had a purpose. You can take him apart all day long if you want but that fucker knew when to bow out. You gotta face it. He dove into that bottle one night and he found himself some clarity, real clarity. And he put a bullet in his head. You can't put a price on that kind of self realization. We ain't there yet are we? Hello. Who? Senor Martin, hey No no no, no I'm awake. No it's no bother. Of course I'm still interested in the property. I sent the check last week. What wait, wait wait wait wait. What do you mean that the check's no good? The bank said what about the money? That's not possible. There's over a half million dollars in that account. Look no no no, I understand that you're not happy but please just give me a few hours and I promise you that I can fix this okay. Thank you, thank you. I'll get back to you soon, okay. Shit. Shit! This is impossible. I want to know where my money is. No no, there's no way. What do you mean a series of transfers? I never, what do you mean into a trust fund? An irreversible trust fund. No look I may have transferred accounts but I, no, no no no no you listen to me. I never set up any trust and I sure as hell didn't take my entire fortune, then who's the fucking trust for? Huh? Hello, hello? Alex. Alex. Whoa whoa! Hold on, hold on. No don't, here, please don't, please don't. You alright Mr. Allen? What the hell are you doing in my house? Front door was open. I just want to make sure you're okay. Jesus Christ. What are you doing with the piece? I thought I heard something. You're a neat freak huh? What. Like you're always taking out the trash. Oh. Yeah. Can we sit down? Sure. Do you know what detectives do. Mr. Allen, apart from the obvious? In order to solve crimes we sometimes build what we call a narrative, story based on past events. Helps us get a picture of things. Reasoning the motive, you follow. Sure. So what we've got is a story of two brothers, Peter and Alex Allen, and for the sake of simplicity our story starts when the boys are teenagers, 15 and 13. That's when their mother is killed in a car accident. Right after this tragic loss the boys steal some of their dad's booze, they go on a real bender. And one night they party with a young girl that they know from school, and on that night that girl is beaten black and blue and left in the city park. She crawls her way to a payphone. When the cops come by to question the boys, Peter's gone. Ran away from home, according to his father and Alex. Alex cops to the crime, no contest. Ends up doing a two year stretch in Juvie, for assaulting a minor. That got me wondering. Wondering what? What happens to all that history between brothers. I mean those are some real ghosts. They don't just fade away do they? You got something to say? My brother is gone, and I don't know where the hell he is if that's what you're asking. No Peter, that's not what this is about. See the part of the story that I left out Is that Alex may have taken the fall for beating that young girl. But she told the cops it was you who attacked her. You know what else doesn't fade away? Patterns of behavior, things that repeat themselves. Say how the death of a loved one could push someone to drink until they black out, maybe take it out on some poor girl. Well that could happen again More Recently We're not talking about your debt to your brother Peter. We're talking about you and Marsha Webb. Why don't you tell us what happened? About a year ago, It might make some sense of all this. And what sets you off. Listen I don't know what the hell you want from me. You come to my house twice last week. This is starting to feel like harassment. Wait a minute, last week? Mr. Allen we came to your house a year ago, asked you about Marsha Webb, Remember? Alright Just cut to it Peter we know about... I think, I think my lawyer should be here. And I want you out of my house. Alright. Alright you can play it that way. Speaking of lawyers you must have one hell of a good one. 'Cause there is no record of your house arrest ever. It's as if it never happened. Denial brother. Denial is the real currency of the world. We see fucked up shit every day don't we? Poverty, disease, war, death of this fucking planet. And what do we say? No, that's on TV someplace else. We can't stand to face the truth so we make up another one. It's in the fucking code. Denial is how we live with ourselves after we've seen what we can really do. Denial that you were born rotten evil motherfucker, and that there's not a good part about you left, or that maybe there never was. And Hell's a prison brother. Once you're there, you're there for life. Burn baby. Burn. Hello. Yes this is Peter Allen. Yes I called about the trust fund earlier yes. Whose name is the trust fund in? Marsha Webb's family, that's not possible. Alex. Alex what are you doing? Sins of the father, remember that? Sins of the father. Goddammit Alex this isn't funny. And you thought you could buy your way out of this one? Listen Alex, they're gonna come for me, my bracelet. Thought you could burn it all away? See that's too easy. Trick is, You gotta dig deep, cause a body has gotta a way of coming back up. And this thing, it's a fucking joke. Alex please. Shut up, shut up. Who'd you think the hole is for anyway brother? You've been digging his hole your whole life, and you just haven't had the balls to lie in it yet. Me, I know who I am, where I am. I'm in the desert somewhere buried under rocks moved by the great flood. Hell, I've been here since the time of Moses you feel me? Over here, here's a good place to die. Show me! All that fucking rage! All that fucking weakness! Oh fuck. What did you see brother, huh? What did you see? That's what you are. Get the fuck out of here. Alex, I told you to get the fuck out of here. Alex! Dear Mr. Allen, I have been asked to inform you that your brother Sergeant Alex H. Allen was killed when his unit was ambushed. I extend you and your family my deepest sympathies. The person who cleaned up that car was trying to wipe down blood. A body has gotta a way of coming back up. Makes you wonder what really happened to her. I'm not the one who fucked. Crystal What's Her Name, you did. And what we've got is a story of two brothers. Sins of the father. Yeah it's the girl from the news. She's been missing about a year. Denial that you were born a rotten evil motherfucker. My brother's gone. Denials the real currency of the world. You can't stand to face the truth so you make up another one. No, I don't do those things. It's like you become a different person after. Those are some real ghosts. The person you were before you had to kill, and the thing you are now. Here we are brother. You left me. Makes us even. I never meant to hurt her. Maybe. Maybe not. But you can't run away from this one. Not this time. After they told me that you, I didn't want to feel any more. I started drinking. Then she came to the house. The time doesn't make sense. How long has it been like this? Since the day you chose to do it this way brother. Denial remember? It's the currency of the world. I don't know if time matters much anymore, not where you're at, not where I'm at either. Take me with you. I can't brother. I'm sorry. What happens to me now?
