I like a woman with big ones... The bigger they are, the more woman. That's what I like. Big hands... big enough to pin you down. There are two kinds of "macho". The "machista", who doesn't believe women have rights... and the icon of a sexy, virile, fearless macho who women love. A real man like me. Women are stronger than men and can handle pain better. Men are really like dogs. They eat what you put in front of them. With women, technique is everything. There is a position where friction from the pubic hairs can give her pleasure. And if she gets an orgasm first, she won't become pregnant. Uh-huh. Shit. Hablas any English? It's broken? I think it's broken. "What attracts you to a woman?" No, no, no. Um... y-you... the tape recorder's broken. I don't understand a word you're saying, so we have to finish. Entiendes?"Finish." Finito, basta. Arret? Terminado? You're a real cutie. Guapa.We have to guapa. You really don't know any Spanish, do you, guapa? Excuse me? Excuse me? Excuse me? I'm Antonio. Oh. God, but you're three hours late. I'm Zoe. A pleasure. How are the interviews going? I have no idea. It was mostly in Spanish, and the tape recorder broke. Now that I'm here, you won't need one. Actually, I will, but I have this video camera, except the battery's out. Who wrote these questions? What's so funny? I... I did. Why? Y-You had them translated? Yeah. Why? You're not going to get honest answers from these. "How do you feel about women"? You can go now. No problem. What? Hey! Wh-What are you doing? I'm not finished with him. Por favor,sit. You're wasting your time with this guy. If you don't mind, I'd like to continue the interview. Sit. Siente... ti, te, ti... por favor. Thank you. Thank you. Now, please... ask him if he believes women should work. How did you meet her? I was having tapas and she wanted to buy me a drink... I said, "Why not, guapa?" You didn't find that strange? No, she's American. You know how Americans are. No, I don't. How are they? Wh-What is...? How long have you been here? Twenty minutes or so... What-What's he saying? He said you were making passes at him, and he's playing along. That's not what he said. But that's what he meant. I didn't hire you for your opinion. I may understand certain subtleties you will miss. You're an interpreter. You're supposed to interpret. That's what I'm doing. You see a Spaniard talking about sex to a foreign woman, he's bound to lie. It's his patriotic duty. Do you know her well? She's my girlfriend. Get lost. Go fuck yourself! He said he had to run. Where in the States are you from? New York. New York? I love New York. Elizabeth Street? Little Italy. You know it? Intimately. So the book is about Spanish men? No, the book is about machismo. Uh-huh. Why are you writing it? I have a contract. You like Spanish men? Excuse me? I am curious because many American women come to Spain just to meet men. I got to go. Oh... sorry. Senor. Uh... Senor. Senor.I'll bet you don't have a boyfriend. Oh? How would you know that? I can tell by the way you carry yourself. You're a little... insecure and just a bit too serious, which could put some men off, but you have certain naivete which is quite charming. Gee, thanks. Senor, por favor. Right away, sir. I didn't mean to offend you. Boy, are you ever sensitive. Boy, are you ever a cocky son of a bitch. What does "cocky" mean? ZOE: Look it up. You're the machote. What's a machote? Get an interpreter. Yeah, one who can speak English. I don't want to work for you, anyway. Taxi! Guapa! Taxi? Bordadores Street, please. You forgot to turn on the meter. - James Brown. - He's equal to Cameron.

I live in England. What about French men? Liars. What kind of man do you like? Um, um, men who are-are thoughtful, communicative... who understand women. Are you sure it's a man you're looking for? I'm not convinced. I think if two people are intellectually compatible, the physical part will work, too. Ah, really? I don't know about you, but I never had an orgasm from a good conversation.

Um... Oh, this one, too. Yeah. Having man trouble? Uh, no, no. It's research for a book I'm writing. Novel? No. Um, uh, it's based on a study based on an article I wrote in Vanity Fair. I approached the publishers, and they accepted. They gave me an advance, so here I am. Wow, that's fantastic. I figured you'd be doing something interesting. You did? Yeah. A girl in my class went out with you. Who? Romaine or Sarah? Nickie. Nickie... Oh... Yeah. Those days. I'm practicing Zen now. You think I'm kidding. Here's ten. Thanks. Oh, great. Thank you. Well, I'll see you again, I guess. I hope so. Bye.Bye. Oh. Sorry. You want to, um... We should... grab a coffee sometime? I... That'd be great. Okay. I'll stop by the shop sometime. Anytime's fine. Okay. How about now? I mean... if you're free. You're probably not, though. I think we have to reevaluate these primal sexual roles and evolve. Men dominating, for instance. Exactly... 'cause in-in the Ice Ages, men were hunters, and women were gatherers. Our needs were different. S-S... uh... So I'm, uh... try... I'm trying to... To figure out what makes men f-feel the need to be dominant. I mean ma-ma... I mean, m-macho, or machisto, as they call it here. They lack communicative skills, so they dominate. Otherwise, they'd feel emasculated. That's what I think. Well, Zoe, I'm glad you're here. Until tomorrow. Until tomorrow. T-Taxi. Taxi. Antonio! Look! A taxi stand. She's a little unstable. I'm afraid to leave her alone. Zoe, we're stopping here for a drink, and then I'll drop you at Bordadores, okay? Okay? Uh, yeah, sure. You know Tricky? No. It's great music for sex. Look, she's shy. She's not shy. She is shy! She's not shy! Sorry, sorry. Uh... I'm going to request a song. She's funny. She gets on my nerves. So why do you take her out? She helps me with my income tax return. I don't believe in long-term relationships. Why not? Because they expire. What do you mean, "they expire"? All relationships really only last two years. After that, the passion dies, and love is just a word you say when you hang up the phone. That's not true. Really? So where is your happy relationship? And how happy are you? At least I have a satisfactory sex life. Yeah, if you call meaningless sex satisfying. Love and sex don't necessarily go together like they're supposed to. You know, you'd be an interesting guy if you weren't such a jerk. Thank you. Let's dance. Come on! "You know Tricky? "I love Tricky. "Great music for sex." Poof. What are you doing? You like it! Are you crazy? Are you crazy? MAN: Be quiet! Are you crazy? MAN: Be quiet! You like to watch, eh? What a face! This light would kill Garbo. Sorry. Are you all right? Didn't I tell you to call the babysitter? We just called. Oh, God. Do it! Fuck. Wait. Kiss me first, tiger. Bye. ♪ Oh, hey, hey ♪ Oh, no, no, no ♪ Taxi! Bordadores Street, please. Hello, guapa. Right away. Are Spanish men very macho in Madrid? Oh, one, two, three. Si,it's possible. Very, very much. A thousand millions machos. In Madrid? No. "When you have sex with a woman, "do you tell all your friends?" Yes. What's the difference between an English man and a Spanish man? Um, body hair. You mean it's a myth? Have you ever met a god in Greece? A-Are you macho? - Yes. - You? No. Si, si, si, si...No. Between love and sex... Love and sex! For me as a woman? It says "woman." Of course, as a woman. Of course, as a woman. It's not on here either. Which one? Emancipation? Who wrote this? These questions have no meaning in this day and age. Greece... that's the most macho country in the world. You're kidding! The Greeks are all gay. Argentina. Swiss. Swiss, yes. ♪ She ♪ Says she scares herself ♪ She feels too much ♪ She ♪ Says she's seen enough ♪ Dreams, like tears... ♪ Shit. Hello? Zoe, I've been calling you all day. Where've you been? I went to your apartment to water the plants. There was a man in there. It's what's called a sublet, Mom. A sublet? Zoe, I worry about you in Madrid. It's a crazy city. Anyway, sweetheart, there's no point in running all around Spain looking for him. I wish you would talk to me about it. I'm not looking for anyone. I'm here writing a book. I've got a contract, for Christ's sake. Darling, I worry about you. By the way, your agent called. What? When? This morning. I'll tell you what... next time, you can call me.I gotta go. Uh, Zoe calling for Cassian Stern. Again, from Spain. I drank your blood. That's a way to bewitch someone. Don't be afraid. It's as painless as a kiss. I saw you come here and I followed you. You forgot your flowers. How's your book going? Well, I've been in this sublet for two weeks. I lost my interpreter, can't speak a word of Spanish... can't find one macho guy in Madrid. Otherwise, I'm doing great. Sounds like you need some company. Absolutely. In Zen, being lost is recognizing the seed of a new identity. Oh, God. Kierkegaard said that. Yes. Kierkegaard, yes, yes! No, no, no, don't, don't... Oh, I'm sorry. That's okay. It's not you. It's me. It'll get better. Carl... do you really remember me from Columbia? Hello? ZOE'S MOTHER: Did you just call? No, Mom, I didn't. Because the phone rang, and by the time I got to it, there was nobody there. Well, it wasn't me. Zoe, how are you, darling?I'm fine. I worry about you in Madrid.Oh, yeah, yeah. Zoe...Look, I can't talk. Sweetheart, you okay? Yeah. This just isn't a good time. I don't know why you always have to be so rude to your mother. Okay, okay, can't we... Oh, by the way, John's in Madrid. He just called, and I gave him your number. What? You didn't? I thought you'd be thrilled.Can we talk another time? You know, I can't really talk right now. You know what? Fine. Bye. My mother. God, you can see we really don't get along very well. Hello? Snookie, I'm in Madrid. John, what are you doing here? I'm following Hemingway's footsteps... you know, fishing. Fishing? My men's group. You'd love them. Will you join me and the boys? Please? Say, Thursday night? It's been very difficult for me... Snookie... I don't know, um... Please, darling? It's so unresolved between us. I've got to see you and talk to you. I've never seen you so assertive. Of course I'm assertive. I've changed.

You wasted your money. You're the only interpreter who answered my ad. Oh. Well, maybe they can get me a date. Sorry, cowboy. I'm already seeing someone. So who's the lucky man? He's, um... He's American. What? You came all the way to Spain just to meet an American? You're a cynic. You know what a cynic is, don't you? What? A disillusioned romantic. Hey, let's have a truce, okay? Friends? I wonder how long this will last. Oh, man... 3:00. He said 2:30. Man... I don't believe this guy. You're late. We're not doing interviews today. What do you mean we're not doing interviews? Interviews don't tell you what people are really like. If you want to understand Spanish men... Why did you want this job back? To practice my English. You mean to learn English. Come on. Where are we going? I have a surprise for you. Tomorrow, interviews. Yeah, yeah. Excuse me. Do you speak English? Isn't it true about the direction of the bullfighter's, you know, the bulge in his pants? It's true. I read it in a magazine. The magazine said if the bulge is on the right, it means he's married, if it points straight down, it means he's shy, if it's on the left, it means he's gay, and if it points straight up, it means he's macho. Would you like some nuts? Here we go, here we go, here we go. On the right. He's married. Well... that wouldn't be the first time for me. Looks like you found yourself a date for tonight, huh? What are you talking about? Don't play innocent. - Look at this one. Is there any truth to this thing? Well, as we say in Spain, todo es toro. Ole! What does that mean? It's all bull. I haven't seen a basket like that since Tom Jones hit Vegas. Can I see? Thank you. He is a real macho. What's wrong? He's swell. Do you think he can see us? Well, Antonio, I guess you can just curl up with a book tonight. Hmm. Freud didn't say that. He did. Tell me. What for? He's inventing it all. Okay, well, I'd like to hear what he's inventing. I said that men go to a whore to sleep with the men who have slept with her before. You speak English. What? And you know about bullfights? The bullfighter is the female and the bull is the male. Everyone knows that. No one knows that. And you know about the tango? In Argentina, when there weren't enough whores, and the men were waiting for their turn, they would tango with each other. Stop that. And the most romantic dance in the world began between men. Well? He said he fantasizes about doing the tango with his boyfriend. Rossy! Precious! Your boobs are bigger everyday. Aren't they fantastic? You're going to get all the dwarfs with those tits. Sit down, queenie. They're journalists. Really? They're doing a study. About what? About "The Spanish man"... Really? Men are no mystery. Men are simple. We are the complicated ones. We have many erogenous zones. Our ears, our necks, even our knees can be erogenous zones, if you do it right. Men have only one reflex point. It pops up or not, depending on your luck. Um... "Women are very demanding." That's not what she said. She spoke for a long time. Well, Spanish is a long language. Are there many machos in Spain? No, we don't have a surplus of them. Most are unknowingly homosexuals. She said she has bad luck with men. No, she didn't. You said, "Machos are homosexual," right? Algunos.Some of them, some of them. So how do you know which ones are...? Ah, that is very easy. When a man says "touch me here, kiss my nipple, lick my ear..." he's queer. Perfect! Well, I gotta go. But I got to go. I have a lot of things to do. Such a pleasure. Watch out for the men, if you can find one. Take care, bonbon. Bye, bye, "sky." Does your gun remind you of anything? To shoot. To hunt. "To shoot, to hunt..." What does it make you think of, your gun? Ducks. Uh, "Ducks... Rabbits... "rabbits." How does it make you feel, um, when you... when you shoot it, you know, when you shoot it and then you clean it and wipe it? Hmm? What is he here for? He's-He's my interpreter. I speak English. Oh, that's good. Antonio... I get the feeling he doesn't want you here. And? Can't you just take a drink or something? Come on. Okay. Do you think men are smarter than women? Nice. Do you think men are smarter than women? What are you doing? Just taking this off. Oh, God. Please. Let me see you like this.I'm... I'm fine. I don't need... thank you. Yeah, I like it. Good. All right, do you wanna answer my questions or... Ask me another question. Okay. Um... let's see. Oh. What attracts you to a woman? Ahem. There are those who talk and those who do. If you want to know what a real man is like... I can show you. I would like to be between your legs. Between your legs. Between your legs. Between your legs. Nice girl. All those guys who play at Club Flamenco are drug addicts. I should have known better. Miss, if you want real macho, go down South. He's from Andalusia, the south. The south? Mm-hmm. You macho? From here up. The downstairs elevator doesn't really work anymore. He said of course he is. I want to go to the south... to Mojacar. Mojacar? Why Mojacar? I heard a lot about that place. From whom? Can't remember. Hotel del Sol. Why don't you go with your smart, respectful American... what's his name? Carl. The feminist. You don't think a man can be a feminist? A feminist man... that's like saying a male chicken, but if it works in bed, who am I to say? C-Carl.Hi. Um, do you know Antonio? This is the lousy interpreter? Thank you, but it's not actually my main profession. What is it that you do do? I'm a writer... a novelist. Why aren't you at work writing novels? "A block is a block is a block." Gertrude Stein. You didn't tell me you were a writer. Well, I haven't written anything in over a year. I'm about as much of a writer as I am a feminist. I don't doubt that. It's a good line for the American girls. It won't work for you. W-We got to go. Um, thank you. No, no, no, no, no. My treat. Yes. Bye.Bye. Adios, muchacho.Adios, asshole. Aah. It's not that I mind being tied down. It's just that I find monogamy... possessive and unnatural. Hmm. So, this guy... you were with him for three years? Hmm? Your ex-boyfriend. Oh, John. Yeah, I thought he was safe. What happened? After three years, we were finally going to get married... not that there was any great passion, but at least we were compatible, and then he flipped out and joined this men's group. How was the sex? How was the sex? The sex? The sex? Hmm? Sorry I asked. It's always been a problem for me. Maybe I should try some Spanish fly or something. Spanish fly. Oh, my God. I haven't heard of that in years. You know it's a myth, don't you? I thought it was a sex pill made from ground insect wings. My dear, Spanish fly was a hoax. The wings are a mild irritant from Morocco that was marketed in the '70s as an aphrodisiac by some shrewd guy who's probably a millionaire by now. If it didn't work, why is the guy a millionaire? But it did work. You see, most... Most sexual problems have to do with timidity. If you just spiked a woman's drink, you wouldn't have any luck, but if you told her you spiked her drink, a lot of women would lose their inhibitions and allow their libido to take over guilt-free because it's all supposed to be out of their control. It's all in the mind.

Till then, I-I thought my father was someone else... this asshole... she was married to for a few years. So then she told me the truth. Apparently they had some fight and she left and she got back to New York, found out she was pregnant. Did she tell him? She said she lost touch with him. We-We-We can't really talk about it because we fight. I don't really know the details. I've never forgiven her for lying to me. He's handsome, huh? Mm-hmm. Big... Big warm eyes eat you up. I used to... have this hope that I'd meet him somehow and he'd recognize me instantly. Then he'd look at me, and everything would be okay. He'd... just fill in all those years of my childhood with one look. Why don't you try to find him? You really think he-he'd want to know about me? It's just... it's just... a childhood fantasy I used to have. Anyway, he wasn't there, and that will never change. Maybe he would have wanted to be. He's an asshole, okay? Okay. You know that every single thing which happens to you in your life makes you what you are, and I think you're great, Zoe. No, I'm not. I'm-I'm... impossible to get along with. That's why every relationship I've had has been a failure. Because you choose... You choose the wrong men. I do? You think they're safe and...

Because I think you look like your father? I don't look like my father! You don't really know what happened here. Do you? Why jump to conclusions that it was his fault that he abandoned you? Can't you give him the benefit of the doubt? Maybe he even loved her. If he loved her, why did he let her go? Why didn't he go after her, huh? Well, if she was anything like you...
