(static) (ambient string music) (electronic beeping) (inhales deeply) Um, hello. I'm all fine. Okay, Oliver, how are you feeling now? - Yeah, I'm okay. - You good? - Yeah. - Doing well? I need you to tell me your full name and date of birth. Oliver Joseph Delaney, 30th of first, 1997. You always have to have all these catheters and enemas and... - All that stuff. - Yeah. I'm just gonna give you a bit of this. [Olly] Okay. [Nurse] Just gonna settle you a bit. - Okay. - Yeah. Should I be counting? [Nurse] Not yet, no. But I will let you know. - Okay, sorry. [Woman] What have you had for your first outing morning tea? [Woman] Sugar? A smarties cookie, a strawberry milkshake, and a picnic. [Woman] A picnic, a smarties cookie and a strawberry milkshake, oh, that's a good look. I'm just going to give you some oxygen. I just want you to breathe normally, okay? I tried to sit up today but that hurt a lot and I've got a little button around here that injects morphine into me. [Woman] Yeah, so if it hurts a lot, you can give yourself. So I'm attaching your drip for you, Oliver and I'm gonna start that drip now, so you should feel it soon, so if you wanna start your count from 10, I reckon now is a good time. Okay, yeah, um. 10. Nine. Eight. Seven. Six. (ambient electronic music) (muffled speaking) (laughing) (muffled speaking) Woo, woo, woo! (chuckles) (laughing) (muffled speaking) [Britney] Oh my gosh. [Olly] Oh my gosh.

Oh, hi, darling. - 'Morning. - How are you? - Yeah, I'm fine. - Yeah? You've got a big pimple on your back. (chuckles) Yeah. Is that from drinking too much alcohol? (Olly laughs) It does, it makes it so where you get pimples in that whole area-- Okay, okay! All right. How you feeling? [Olly] Yeah, I'm fine. - You alright? - Yeah. [Mum] Good night? Yeah, it was great. Big night? [Mum] It looks like it. [Mark] Do you want some breakfast, man? [Mum] You should have something to eat, sweetheart. I'm fine, I'm just gonna, I'm just feeling a bit sick-- Why don't you take your vitamins and have some water and have something to eat and you'll feel a bit better. [Olly] I just woke up. I know you just woke up. Hey darl, there's this article in here about transplants coming to Australia that Mark found. You don't want to read it? - No, I'm- - It's just-- Mum, I'm okay, please. - Have a read, man. - You should read because, yeah, it's quite, I would've thrown it out and he just-- [Olly] Her boyfriend is actually like a man-child. Aw that's unfortunate. Yeah, it's really gross, it's like where the fuck do you find them, like the-- - Hey, Luke, buddy! - How you doing, man? - Oh, hey, Olly. Didn't see you there. - Hey. - Hey, catch, mate. (chuckles) How you been, man, did you go to Gabby's party on the weekend? - Yeah, what did you do? Yeah, Sonny and I, we, uh, there he is, we were hanging out at the Macca's car park, hanging out with these older girls. - (chuckles) Fuck, man. (chuckles) All right, we gonna catch up soon. All right mate? - Yeah. [Brandon] All right, see ya, buddy. (Luke mumbles) (Olly laughs) (laughs) - Hey! - Hey! - How ya going? - Good, thanks. - You all right? - Yeah (laughs). What are you up to? (Nat mumbles) [Olly] What are you doing? Uh, I think we're just gonna go to the movies. Oh, okay, are you guys like dating? [Luke] Mm. Yeah. (Luke and Nat giggling) Kinda. That's awesome. - Thanks, man. - That's really, really cool, guys. Well. - Yeah, well. See ya. [Nat] See you. - See ya babe. - See ya babe. Aw. (Olly laughs) - See ya. - See ya, bro. (Olly chuckles) Make sure you use protection, guys. [Luke] Go away. - Be safe! - [Luke] Go away. [Nat] Ow! [Luke] Really? (Olly chuckles) (gentle electronic music) [Mum] Darling. - Hey. - How are you? [Olly] Yeah, good, how are you? Yes, good, busy day, how was school? It was fine (sighs heavily). Have you been waiting long? What? (laughs) Were there many people before you? [Olly] Yeah. Always running late, it's really annoying. Like someone else I know. Mmm. (Oliver chuckles) (sighs) You okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Don't. - Why? Why can't I touch this? - Stop it. Seriously. Can I just listen to my music if that's cool? Is it cool if I just listen to my music? Darling, you need to speak more clearly. (chuckles) You are so-- Do you learn it at school? Enunciation? - Clearly no. - Sorry. (Olly scoffs) No, okay. (sighs) I love it here. (both chuckle) - Oliver Delaney? - Yes! [Woman] You can go through. If you can see here, your right hip is severely damaged. It's really a miracle you can walk at all. I'm not sure how you manage it, but if you keep walking this same way, it will deteriorate to the point where you'll need a hip replacement. How long before that needs to happen? Depends how he walks, his bones are already compromised because of the osteoporosis. Maybe 10 years. I would recommend getting him into surgery now though to release and lengthen some of the ligaments to help improve his walk. Ah (chuckles) if you wanna get him into surgery now, why not do the hip replacement now? No point in replacing tires if they're not worn out yet. How do you know if they're worn out? Uh, you won't be able to walk anymore. You won't be able to put weight on your right leg. Plus, you'd feel it. The pain, I mean. And you're saying this ligament operation will prevent that? [Doctor] Yes, hopefully. How long will he be in hospital for? [Doctor] Two to three weeks, but then in a wheelchair for about three months after that, depending on how quick he recovers. Well, he usually recovers pretty quickly, so. Don't you? Mm-hmm. How do you feel? I'm fine, can we just go? Sorry about that, darling. Why, did you do it, did you fuck up my hip? Was it you all along? No, I haven't done anything, I haven't done anything about your rehab. What are you talking about, you took me here? You do heaps-- We haven't done anything for about a month. (sighs heavily) And I've been so busy and I'm just-- It's not your fault, none of this shit makes a fucking difference, we'll just have the operation and it'll sort it out, okay? We don't, fucking rehab shit, like me like doing squats doesn't do diddly-squat, okay? So like, fucking hell, it's fine Mum, seriously. Let's just go. So what you're saying is squats don't do diddly-squat? That's exactly what I just said, that's verbatim. (chuckles) Seriously Mum, it's fine, it's not your fault. It's life. Okay, well, look, you go in hospital on Monday, right? [Olly] Yeah. So it's Saturday night, I think we'll have all your friends over and we'll have a big party. Yeah? - I can't believe I said that. - Can we have alcohol? (chuckles) Can I have alcohol? You can have two drinks. Two drink, can people bring alcohol? Fuck, just don't tell me about it, don't tell me. (laughs) I won't tell you, my lips are sealed. I won't tell you a thing. Okay? - Thank you. - All right, love you. - Thank you, Mum. Oh, I hate that place. (laughs) I love it, it's my favourite place. It's my Disneyland. (music blaring) (friends laughing) - Olly! - What? Mum, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine! - Come and have water! - I don't need any water! Yes you do! (laughs) Why aren't you guys dancing, it's a party. (Nat mumbles) All right. Well, hello. - Hey. - Hi! Ow! Oh my God, just in time, the party's so good! The party's so good, isn't it guys, it's the best party. It's better than last week. - You're fucked! - No, I'm not. I'm having fun. Who's that? Is that your dad? No. It's my mum's boyfriend. [Britney] He's a fucking babe. Come dance with me, come dance with me, babe. Come dance with me! - You have fun. - Come dance with me! No, oh my God, get off me! (music blaring) (students laughing) Excuse me, I'm really sorry, please, sorry. (Olly breathing heavily) (door knocking) I'm coming! [Mum] Olly, darling, you okay? - Go away! - I'm coming in. No, go away, what the fuck, get out, what the-- It's all right, it's all right. [Olly] Ow, what the fuck are you doing, go away! Get outta here! I'm just-- [Olly] No, fuck, please go away. - It's okay. - Please go. It's okay, it's okay. - Go away! - Don't hit me. It's all right, I just-- - Please go away! Please go away. I'm not going away, Olly. [Olly] Fuck. All right, darling, I'm going to going away. Go away! Don't-- - Get away. - Okay. Hit me, fine. [Mum] What happened, did you get a bit drunk? What do you think happened, what do you think happened? [Mum] Why'd you do that? Why'd I pee myself, 'cause I felt like it. I really wanted to pee myself. - Why'd you drink so much? Fuck off, you fucking hypocrite. Why? - You fucking hypocrite. - Why am I a hypocrite? - Pot kettle black shit. Fuck you, get out, get out, get out, get out! Get the fuck out, get the fuck out right now! (Mum chuckles) - Now! - All right, darling. I'm gonna go get some new pants-- [Olly] Don't get me new pants! A glass of water and a can of Coke-- [Olly] There's water right here! And you're going to calm the fuck down! - Ooh. - Okay? And furthermore, all of your friends are going home. [Olly] They're not going home! It's one o'clock in the morning, they're going home! This is my house, the party is over! If you sent them home, I'm actually, listen to me. I'm gonna fucking kill you if you send them home. If you actually send them home I'm not even joking. You're not leaving, if you send them home, I'm actually gonna kill you, you promise me you're not gonna send them home. [Mum] Okay, here's what we don't do. We don't threaten to kill each other. Fucking bitch. That's what you are. Fuck! Ow. It's not that bad. [Olly] How would you know, can you please stop? Oh, fine, okay, look, I've gotta go back to work, so I'm gonna see you later. - Mm-hmm. - Drink lots of water, okay? (lips smacking) Bye. [Olly] Bye. (breathing heavily) (metal rattling) (Olly grunting) [Nurse] Are we ready, one, two, three. Ow! [Nurse] Okay, shh, shh, shh, there's people sleeping. [Olly] Can you do it just a little bit, can you please just do it a little bit gentler, please? Almost done. Okay, just go over this side. (giggling) - Hey man. - (chuckles) Hey. - Hey babe. - Hi. We got you these. Everyone drew on them. I drew a really, I can't-- You drew a rhubarb. (laughs) - [Olly] A rhubarb? I thought it was appropriate. 'Cause, yeah, 'cause you're sweet. - Are rhubarbs sweet? - And I'm pretty sure it says that rhubarbs are the most intelligent vegetable. Cool, why are they big fat undies? 'Cause you've got a big fat bum. [Olly] (laughs) But why undies anyway? 'Cause you're not wearing any underwear (chuckles). Oh, cool, so now I've got my undies for my fat ass. Yeah, how you feeling? I'm good. - You feeling, yeah? - Yeah. - How's your leg? - How's that, boop. (chuckles) (laughing) Thanks so much for this, guys. Fat baby. (laughing) [Olly] Fat baby? - I do. - Fat baby? (laughing) What? It's what Gemma said. [Olly] Fat baby, can I see? - You had to be there. - I was at Gemma's. [Olly] Can I see? Jo just drew a fat baby. [Olly] Can I see? He's always doing shit like that. - Jo is like-- - Oh my God. [Luke] (chuckles) See I told you. Um, I drew you guys something. - That looks so real. - I know, he's really-- Present! Oh wow. Present! Oh my gosh. Oh wow. Present! Holy crap! - That's crazy. - Got nothing else to do. - Did you draw these? - Yeah. [Nat] Babe, they're awesome. Wow. Far out, man. - You're so good. - Thanks. Hey, sorry to be a bitch, but we're gonna be late for the movie. [Luke] Oh shit. What movie? We're gonna see- Knife Wars. - Knife Wars (chuckles). I got some DVDs and stuff if you guys wanted to-- It's not out on DVD. (laughing) Um, some of the other, like, um, who's meeting, Jo and I think Gabby's gonna be there too. - And Gemma. - Gemma. - Fucking Gemma. - Fucking Gemma. (friends laughing) Oh yeah. - Bye. - See you babe. I love you (lips smacking) I'll come see you soon. [Olly] Okay. Boop. See you babe. - See you, man. [Olly] See ya. ("A Prelude To" by Lawrence English) (keys clicking) [Reporter] Finally, after months of government approvals, the controversial full-body transplants are making their way to Australia, with trials to start in the coming weeks. Pioneered in Germany, the transplants are for people suffering from a terminal illness or with an untreatable disability, a chance at a whole new life. Ow. (metal rattling) (grunts) Ow.

[Mum] Oh, did you (chuckles) how was it? Hospital food. (groans) Yuck (chuckles). What have you guys been up to? Oh, we just had a work, a dinner thing for my work, so it was a bit (laughs). You been drinking? I had a couple little wines, dinner, so nothing-- I was actually just about to go to bed guys, actually. I'm sorry, guys-- - I'm not drunk. I didn't say you were drunk, I just said I was about to go to bed, so. Is that cool? I'm tired. But I haven't seen you in ages. I haven't gone anywhere. Yeah, but darl, I thought we could spend the night together and watch one of those DVDS. Lovey. Look, I'm fine, I'm just, I'm just really tired and I just want to go to bed. What? I'm sorry. Why are you apologizing, you haven't done anything wrong. I'm sorry, it's been a really fucking hard couple of weeks, and I know it's been hard for you too. I can't imagine, I (sighs heavily). I haven't been around-- - Can you just fucking stop? Okay, I'm sorry, this is the reason why I don't wanna fucking see you 'cause you fucking do this shit. I just said I'm fine, I'm tired, I'm really fucking shitty. I'm grumpy, please just go, okay? It's not you, it's got nothing to do with you. So please just go. Can you give us a minute alone, please? Thanks, darl. - Yeah. I'm just tired. I'm really fucking tired. I don't know. (sighs heavily) Fucking hell, it's just been shit. I know, darl, I know, but it's nearly finished. I've just been, I've been reading up about, you know that article and those body transplants and just, oh, I've just been thinking and just that would just be fucking, I dunno. Oh, fucking hell. Is that something you wanna do? Is that like, what? Is that even possible? I mean I don't know, I could look into it. I don't know, do you want me to? Yeah. Thanks, Mum. - Don't worry. - I love you. - I love you. (ambient electronic music) Just straighten up your torso too, if you can. Yeah, good. [Olly] Can you help me get this off, Mum? [Mum] Sure. [Olly] Sorry. [Mum] No, that's okay. I didn't even know they did those in Australia. Yeah, they um, yeah, no, they've just started doing trials here, but they've been doing them in like, the States and Europe and stuff for years like, I mean it's been done before, it's not dodgy or anything. So you're gonna have like a completely new body? Yeah (chuckles). How am I gonna recognise you? You're not, but I'll tell you it's me. I'll be like, it's me, and you'll be like, "Who?" And I'll be like, me! And then we'll just repeat that for eternity. Aw, sweet, that's gonna be fun. (laughs) It's gonna be so weird, man. - Yeah. - That's great. Thanks. What are you thinking? Oh, um, no, just, (chuckles) it's just wow. Fuck. Yeah. I, um, there's actually something else I want to talk to you guys about as well. (chuckles) - There's more? - Yeah (chuckles). Um, so with the transplants as well and stuff, (chuckles) they, um, they have these cases where... (chuckles) I don't know, I'm sorry guys, basically, it's just that like, what I'm thinking, I'm thinking of doing, I'm not even sure I can do it, but like, I think maybe I might have my new body like... be a woman. (chuckles) - Oh my God. - (chuckles) Yeah. Um. Are you, do you think you're a transvestite? No, it's not that, I just, I've just been reading it, I just thought like, that might be good, I don't know, it's fucking stupid, I'm sorry. That's fucking cool, that's really cool! Very, very cool. - I'm sorry, guys. - Why are you apologizing? Look at me. We love you so much. Thanks (sighs). No, no, I mean, you know, I can look into it if that's, I mean, if that would...

I was thinking, I know it's similar but at least if you guys stuff up, you're not gonna, you know, it's not gonna be too weird, Olly, Olivia. Sounds like a nickname, right? - Mm-hmm. - Yeah. But do you think that anyone, you know, is gonna know or? No, babe (chuckles) you don't look like Olly at all. (laughs) That was the idea but, yeah, that means please, call me her or she or.

But are you happy? - You like my boobs? (Nat and Olly laugh) Awkward turtle. How weird is it having boobs? It's pretty good, they weigh shit though. (laughs) Back pain. Joking, it's fine, they're not that big. What the fuck, isn't that for like sheep or some shit? (chuckles) Yeah, but like they do it on humans too. Like in the States and in Europe.

I gotta live with this for the rest of my fucking life! [Student] Man. I have to live with this for the rest of my fucking life! - You okay? - Yeah, I'm okay. - Are you okay? - Yeah. You sure? It's gonna be okay, I promise you. Promise you it's gonna be okay. Okay. I'm not gonna let anyone hurt you. [Olly] Okay. Okay, you're all right. I love you. - I love you too. It's just me. Sorry. How you doing? Um, I'm good. Cool, just thought I'd double-check. Thanks. I, um, I didn't mean to tell them. It just kinda came up in training. Yeah, I'm sorry. You told Brandon? Yeah. Okay. All right, well, if they give you any more shit, just tell me and I'll talk to them. Okay, thanks. All right, see ya. Bye. I don't know what the fuck's going on, like why would he do that? He must seriously fucking hate me right now. Babe, why do you care so much? What do you, he's my best friend. It doesn't sound like it. Oh, baby, I'm sorry, I didn't mean it like that. I just mean like telling Brandon, that's fucked. If he's your friend, he should be your fucking friend. If he's being a dickhead, he's not worth your time. You should just not see him anymore. (chuckles) How can I not just not see him? (laughs) What are you saying? Just don't see him. But he's my best friend, babe. Oh my god, you're so stupid. You're choosing to be treated like shit. (Britney scoffs) I'm in love with him. When the fuck did that happen? Since always, like forever. Fuck. Fucking god. You can't tell anyone, okay, especially not Nat. Babe, I'm not retarded. [Olly] So what do you think I should do then? Fuck me, I don't know then. It's just like, I don't know, I feel like I'm being such a shit friend right now, it's like I don't care if he's happy, like I actually don't give a shit. Like be unhappy, but be with me, that's like seriously like, it's fucked, it's just not being a good friend, you know? And it's like I'm lying to him. You should tell him. [Olly] Tell him what? All this shit. Tell him the truth, tell him that you're in love with him. (chuckles) What good would that do? If he knew, he might stop being such a dick. Well, it's Luke, he'd probably freak the fuck out. Or he'd fuck you. Yeah, don't look at me like that. That just wouldn't happen, okay? Babe, you're a hot bitch, why not? (chuckles) For starters, he's with Nat! He's a guy, you're hot. I guarantee you he wants to fuck you, it's just biology and, look, if he likes you more than her, it's not your fault (chuckles). It's Luke, it's fucking gross how much he loves you. Like fuck, he could be in love with you too right now but he can't do anything about it because he's stuck with Nat so instead, he's just just treating you like shit. It's fucked but it might be the case. You've gotta stop letting guys treat you like shit. You call the shots.

Why the fuck am I apologizing? Oh, take some fucking responsibility! Do you even have any fucking idea what it's like to be your son? Do you even fucking get it? Everyone fucking hears it down the fucking street, you and your fucking boyfriends and you dare judge me for this! Fuck you, okay? Maybe if you weren't such a fucking slut, I wouldn't be so fucked up right now. And maybe you would have fucked out Dad away. Fuck you, Olly! I left your father for you! Because he wasn't good enough for you! Like everything that I have done in my life for you! Get out, get out, get out of my room! Fuck, get out of my house, get out of my house!
