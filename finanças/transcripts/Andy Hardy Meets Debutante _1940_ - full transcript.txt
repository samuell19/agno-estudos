'Andrew. Andrew Hardy.' 'If you're not down to breakfast in one minute' 'I'll come up and get you.' I've been taught never to come to breakfast before doing my morning ablutions. You know, Mrs. Hardy cleanliness is next to Godliness. 'Milly. Milly, come down here, will you?' - 'Hurry.' - 'Coming, Emily.' Why, Emily dear, what's the matter? Milly, I think I'm going insane. Oh, nonsense. Now, what is it? What's wrong? Well, here you are. Recipe for a chocolate pudding. Read that. "Then remove the mixture from the icebox, add four eggs and..." Continued on next page, column two. "Pour it down the sink." Pour it down the sink! "Add four eggs and pour it down the sink." Now, am I insane or not? Now, wait. Oh, somebody has cut out a picture or something. And we've been reading, "How to clean clogged drainpipes." Well, I thought that was a silly way to make a chocolate pudding. There's something very funny going on around this house. This morning, I found two pages cut out of Home Fashion Guide. I'm trying to finish this dress without the pattern. Maybe pictures of flowers were on the other side and Andy cut them out. What's happened to that boy? I've called him twice. Andrew Hardy, for the third time. 'I'm practically there, mom.' - Gee, where's the fire? - Fire? The way you expect me to get downstairs I figured you thought I was a fireman. - Good morning. - Good morning, Aunt Milly. - Good morning, dear. - Oh, ow. Beware the pins. I'll get it, mother. How many times have I told you? Oh, mom. Wait till I'm ready. Not this morning. I'm botanizing. I've gotta collect 20 specimens of wild flowers. On Saturday? 'Is mother's little lamb feeling alright?' My dear mother, I'm studying botany. You've never known what it is to commute with nature. Eh, commune with nature. Andy, stop eating that doughnut. Botanically speaking, this isn't eating. This is osmosis. As in plants, so in human beings. Eating is just osmosis on a larger scale. Now, take Dianthus caryophyllus or Rubus idaeus... What kind of language is that for a nice boy to use? Well, it's alright, mom. It just means raspberries. Polly Benedict's father is on the phone. Wants dad to meet him at the orphan's home positively before 1 o'clock. Oh dear, and your father's gone fishing. Calm yourself, ladies. I'll get the message to him while doing my botanizing. I know his favorite fishing place. Maybe you can find him before he catches anything. Then we won't have to have fish for dinner. - Alright, mom. - Show me your botany specimen. Maybe I can help classify them. Marian. Marian. Would you have me cheat? It's dishonorable for a student to accept help. Andy. Andy. Oh, that boy! Now, he's gone without his breakfast. Don't worry, mother. Nature feeds its own. Don't be silly. Andy can't eat wild flowers. Of course, Daphne, there's no chance of me ever meeting you. But, oh boy, they can't put you in jail for dreaming. Well.. What are you doing here? I-I was lo-looking for you, dad. Back of a log? N-no, sir. I-I'm collecting botany specimens. What you want me for? Mr. Benedict wanted to meet you at the orphanage at 1 o'clock. Uh-huh... sounds like trouble. I've hardly got my line wet. Why don't you fish a little longer... 'Andy, it's taken me two-thirds of a lifetime' to learn that when there's trouble ahead there's no use trying to find entertainment in the meantime. So, come on to the orphanage. Dad, I've been wanting to talk to you for quite sometime now. Well, I've been around. Shoot. You want me to be a success in life, don't you? I certainly do. Well, is it, is it true that all successful men marry sophisticated women? You know, women of the world. I hardly think so. But it, but it would help, though, wouldn't it? Have a wife they could handle chauffeurs and footmen and be at home in a nightclub as well as in the kitchen. I see your point. You know, you're a swell guy, dad but I wonder how far you'd have gone in this world if you had married a woman like Cleopatra. I don't dare think of it. What about the nice old-fashioned girls like Polly Benedict? I've been going around too steadily with Polly Benedict. I'm gonna have a little talk with her about it. I see. Take the first turn for the orphanage. Now, wait for me. In the meantime, you might cogitate on the fact that Cleopatra brought disgrace, disaster, and death to every man who ever fell in love with her. "Death, where is thy sting?" Well, hello there. You're new here, aren't you? Please, yes, sir. My name is Francis, please. I'm glad to know you, Francis. Hello, little girl. I'm a boy, please. You-you talk like a little girl. How do you expect to grow up and be a big he-man? Like you? Yes, son. Now, look, my boy. If you go through life the way you're starting people will always be taking your marbles away from you. Let me give you a little man-to-man advice. Now.. "The default of the bonds in your trust fund "absolves the Cyrus Carvel Estate of any further financial responsibility." Default of bonds? Why, Cyrus Carvel left millions. He left a good half million of it to maintain his old home for our orphans. Sixteen homeless orphans. The founder of Carvel wouldn't want that to happen anymore than we do. As my son Andrew would say, "They can't do this to us." But that letter, Jim. Those big New York lawyers can't be wrong. No! I drew up the trust fund legal papers myself. They are absolutely foolproof. I made sure of that. Are you positive? I'll stake my legal reputation on it. I'm so positive, I'll go to New York myself and personally handle Messrs, uh, Dabney, Cot, and Underwood. - Now what's your name? - My name's Butch. What do you wanna make of it? There, that's swell. That's swell. Now, don't forget anything I told you. Andy. Oh. Hello, Polly. Run along and play with your bicycle, my little man. Your Uncle Andrew has a very painful duty to perform. I'm waiting for my father. Say, Polly, I'd like to have a little talk with you. I'd like to have a little talk with you too, Andy. I don't think we ought to go together so steadily. What? Well, relationships like ours sometimes grow into more serious things. And a girl of 17 is always older, more mature more sophisticated than a boy of the same age. Why, you-you-you're crazy. You're crazy, Polly. The situation isn't fair to you. Fair to me? Who was it that failed in Geometry the year that I got B+? And who said only last Sunday that the Epistles were the wives of the Apostles? As Mark Antony said "Et tu, Brute." It wasn't Mark Anthony. It was Julius Caesar. Wouldn't you be happier with somebody who'd look up to you? Look up to me? Oh, my gosh. Miss Benedict... there are some girls of 17 that make you seem like a mere child, a backward child at that. Good day, Miss Benedict. I suppose I have to see you at the editor's meeting but kindly continue to address me as Miss Benedict. Toot, toot, toot, toot, toot. Well, young fella, do you like it here? You said a mouthful, toots. 'Toot, toot, toot..' The editor in chief of the Carvel High Olympian requests the gentleman associate editor to kindly pay attention. Oh, I've got more important things on my mind, Beezy. Botany, for instance. Say, Andy, can I borrow your botany book? You cannot! He probably has botany confused with Mother Goose and he won't go to bed without it. Okay, you rat. Meeting will come to order to approve the cover for the next issue. Ah, here it is. 'What? You're not gonna put' 'Cynthia Potter's picture on the cover and call it' the most beautiful girl in the world? Well, if she isn't, who is? Maybe the most beautiful girl in the world don't even live here in Carvel. Andy, please, I practically promised Cynthia she'd be on the cover. All in favor of Cynthia's picture... - No! - No! I vote for a cover with the most interesting achievement of the month by a student. And I don't mean boyish pranks. Hm, I hate to agree with Miss Benedict but I vote for the same thing. - Oh, I'm ruined. - Well, meeting's adjourned. Thanks. I'll give this back Monday. Hey, you leave that down, Beezy. That's my property. Why, Andy, he doesn't mean any harm. Ho ho ho. Hey, look at this. '"Daphne Fowler. Princess Royal of the 400."' 'Look, Polly, the book's filled with pictures of that dame.' Well, of all the ridiculous little boy exhibitions. 'Andy's got a crush on Daphne Fowler.' Collecting pictures of a perfectly awful girl that he's never even seen. I have so seen her. I-I met her about 2 years ago. The first time I met her, she liked me more than she ought. Oh, Daphne Fowler goes around with grown men. She wouldn't even look twice at a small town schoolboy. Oh, yeah? Well, she was so crazy about me she asked me to have the first dance with her when she debuted. Then, why don't you go? Been begging my father to send me to New York. You could always run away from home. Sure, you could hop a freight. Maybe you do things like that and break your mother's heart but I've been brought up better. Furthermore, I doubt if I could even get away from New York without-without having to marry her. But, of course, he can't possibly get to New York. It would be great if I can get to New York. But I suppose we all have our crosses to bear in this unhappy world. Well, get ready, everybody. Here it comes. Here what comes? What you've been dying to tell us since you got home. Can't fool me, James Hardy. I give up. Well... to make a long story short we're all going to New York City for a visit. 'New York?' - 'All of us?' - 'How wonderful!' New York? We won't know how to act. There's always grandmother's book on etiquette. New York! Yes, I've gotta lick a big New York law firm for the orphanage. How does that sound, Andy? Oh, wh-why, I-I can't go to New York. Well, miracles never cease. Why? I-I can't go and I won't go. Hey, hey, wait a minute. Why do we have to go to New York? Why pick that place? In New York, vice and corruption flourish rampant. It'll tell you so in the paper. 'New York's a sink of..' Well, it's a sink. And I-I don't wanna go, I wouldn't be safe there. Well, I've got to go to New York. "If the mountain won't come to the Muhammad Muhammad has to go to the mountain." What would he want with a mountain anyway? You may never have another chance to see New York. What does it have that Carvel hasn't? Just tall buildings. 'What do people do when in tall buildings?' They jump out of windows. That's what they do. I tell you, New York is a den of evil. Well, son, New York is evil in some aspects but so is every village and city in the world. But the fact remains, we're leaving for New York. James, you don't really want me to go. Well, there's my school and-and the expense. 'Milly.' When I married your sister, I said "Whither thou goest, I will go." 'I might also have added, "We'll will take your sister too."' As regards your school, I've already spoken to the principal. And-and what about my school, dad. I'll miss my classes and I'll get behind. I won't graduate. Why, I'll end up a homeless derelict in the gutter. Aunt Milly is gonna give you your lessons every day till we get back. And I wired Martha Booth to find accommodations. Then Andy will have Betsy Booth for a playmate. She must be 15 now. Nice old-fashioned girl too. 'I think it's wonderful.' Well, dinner's getting cold. Andrew, eat your dinner. A guy's world comes crashing down around his shoulders and you offer him corn beef and cabbage. Something tells me we have Mr. Andrew Hardy right where we want him. Hello. This is Miss Polly Benedict speaking. Oh, hello, Miss Benedict. Yes, I've read the morning papers. Well, it's not positive that I'm going to New York with the family. I don't feel so well. Oh, you'll feel better just as soon as you're on the train speeding to the side of your loved one. You'll be glad to know that we're printing the story of your flaming romance with Daphne Fowler in the high school magazine. You're gonna what? But, uh, but you mustn't print anything about me and Daphne. It's a secret. Listen, Hardy, Cynthia Potter ain't gonna speak to me again. So, you better make good with that debutante 'cause when you get home, you'll be the talk of the town. Talk of the town, huh? We just know you're gonna send us back a photograph of darling Daphne and you to illustrate the story. You what? You and Beezy agreed.. You're gonna put it on the cover too, huh? Yeah, yeah. Goodbye. Andrew, we'll meet you and your father at the station. Be there early, the engineer may be in a hurry to start. Turn the gas out under the coffeepot when your dad's had his last cup. Andrew, you've done everything on your mother's list? Everything but the kitchen stove. You better do that now. I don't want any more coffee. And what was it mother wanted me to do? Oh, yeah, I know. I'm sure that's what mother wanted me to do. Andrew. Well, for goodness sake, what's the matter with you? Don't-don't worry about me, dad. Just go on and catch your train. O-oh, what's wrong? Oh, I-I've had a complete nervous breakdown. One minute I had my health and the next minute I collapsed. Collapsed? I saw purple spots in front of my eyes. Then, everything went black. I think I've got heart trouble. I just read a new treatment for heart trouble. 'It consists of grabbing the patient violently' 'by the back of the neck... ' Oh, no, no, dad. Just, please, just-just leave me alone. Just let me lie here and die peacefully. Andrew Hardy, if you aren't up on your feet in three seconds.. - Oh, well, it was worth trying. - You, you come along. Andrew, I don't wanna pry into your secrets but all this to-do about going to New York has me worried. Well, dad, I-I can't tell you about that. But maybe if we sat down and talked life over carefully for say about half hour or so... And carefully miss the train? No, Andrew, we're leaving this minute. - Come on. - That's, uh, final? That is final. Well, we better get a move on, dad because I set the clock back 10 minutes. You did? You what? Come on here. - It's-it's stupendous! - It's unbelievable. 'Even if I see it, I don't believe it.' - 'James.' - 'Mm-hm.' - 'That building..' - 'Yeah.' '...is on fire.' Ha-ha. Oh, mother, that's steam escaping. I guess I'm nervous about fire. Andrew, sure you turned out the gas underneath the coffeepot? Mom, don't I always do everything you tell me to? James, Martha Booth's husband's a rich man. Suppose she reserves rooms in some very expensive hotel? Ah, don't you worry, mother. Got a telegram on the train this morning from Betsy. Her father and mother are out of town but everything's okay. 10-57, East 49. This is what New York City calls a maisonette. An apartment remodeled from one floor of an old-fashioned brownstone residence. - James, I smell coffee. - Of course, you smell coffee. There's a general housework girl here. - Why, it's Betsy Booth. - Sure. I'm Betsy. Hope you didn't mind my answering your telegram. - Betsy. - Hello, Mrs. Hardy. Like the apartment? Isn't it cute? The servant can't come till tomorrow so I'm making coffee. - Hello, Andy. - Hello, Betsy. Wonderful to see you. Somebody help me get outta this apron? Didn't think you'll get here for another half hour. Andy, it's-it's so wonderful to see you. Guess I said that before though, didn't I? You know, well, welcome to New York, everybody. I'm all out of breath, ain't I? Ain't I? Well, I'm a little out of breath myself, Betsy. You got this apartment and hired a girl all by yourself? - I sure did. - There you see, Andy. Even in New York, a nice girl thinks more about growing up to be a good housewife than dancing the rumble. - Ma, rumba. - I smell the coffee burning. Oh, Andy, I brought my own radio over for you to listen to. You see, Mrs. Hardy, it's only common gratitude. After all, back in Carvel Andy took me to my first grown-up party. Son, how do you do it? Mm, dad, she doesn't mean anything. It's, well, hero worship, that's all. Well, my little hero, let's get unpacked. Mother, I bet this will be one of the most exciting times in our lives. Why, I get to lick my waiting wildcats in this town. Emily, don't tell me you actually brought this book of etiquette. Why, darling, that's the way people conducted themselves way back in the 80s. Nice people never change. James, you think it's alright for Andy to walk out with Betsy? - Hm? - I mean, there are gangsters. They might take Andy for a ride or put him on the spot. Well, Betsy's a New Yorker so, of course, she carries a gat. Of cour.. Oh, my goodness. And what I don't know about New York I've been reading in a guide and I can show you everything like the Statue of Liberty and Grant's Tomb and Rockefeller Center. - Kid's stuff. - Yes, I-I suppose so. Even if it is a little hard on Rockefeller Center. Oh, and here's St. Patrick's Cathedral. 'I was here at a wedding last week.' - Aren't weddings wonderful? - I'll never know. I expect to live and die a bachelor. Here-here's where we live, see. Way up on the top floor. Sure, very interesting for tourists. Yeah, I suppose so. Well, Andy, it was swell of you to bring me home. - It's nothing at all, Bets. - Won't you come in? No, no, thanks. I've gotta be going home. I've got a desperate problem on my hands. Me against the City of New York and one of us is gonna be ruined in the struggle. Maybe it'd help you if you use mother's car and chauffeur while the folks are away. Say, that will help a lot. Thanks. Only I think maybe she'd want me to stay with the car. You know, to see that it would be safe. Sure, that's alright. I don't mind you riding with me providing you don't ask any personal questions. I won't. I'll snuggle up in the corner. You won't know I'm there. What time shall I bring the car? What time do New Yorkers get up? If there's anybody you wanna see, we'll wake 'em up. Alright, let's get an early start. Say about 6:30? I think there might be just a few people in New York that even we couldn't get up that early. - Why don't we start about nine? - Alright, nine it is. - Goodbye then. - Goodbye, Andy. Good afternoon, Miss Booth. Lovely day, isn't it? Kid's stuff! Good afternoon, Miss Booth. And how are you today? I'll never know. Good afternoon. There's some mail on the drawing room table. Very interesting for tourists. Good afternoon, Miss. Will there be anyone for dinner, Miss Booth? I expect to live and die a bachelor. - Mom. - Yes, dear. If I, if I asked you something very confidential you wouldn't betray me to your husband, would you? My husband? Well, my husband's your father. - Yeah. - Oh, I see what you mean. No, dear, no. Well, look, mom. If you were a stranger in a strange city and you wanted to meet someone that you've never met before how would you go about meeting them? Them? Say one or two or just one person. Well, I'll write them a nice little letter. Let's look at grandmother Hardy's book of etiquette. That's it, mom. Saturate me with etiquette. Of course, a letter like this couldn't be sent through mail. It would have to be delivered in person. Gosh, mom, you must have been reading my mind. "A letter introducing a young man, still unknown to fame "to a lady of fashion or distinguished social position. "Dear madam, commit me to present to you my friend 'Mr. John Smith."' Who-who's John Smith? That would be you, dear. Where was I? "To present to you, my friend, Mr. Andrew Hardy '"a gentlemen who's polished manners' 'and irreproachable character.."' Boy, mom, that's me all over. Now, you wait here, Betsy. Don't follow me. No, I'll even keep my eyes shut. - And don't you look, Prentiss. - No, Miss Betsy. Is she in? She? I mean, is Miss Fowler in? I have a letter for her. I'll see that Miss Fowler gets it. Uh, not this letter. This has to be delivered personally. Come in, please. I'll speak to Mrs. Hackett as soon as she's free and you can give your letter to her. Who is Mrs. Hackett? Miss Fowler's secretary. I'm afraid you won't be able to see Miss Fowler herself. - Oh! - Won't you sit down, please? Oh, thanks. - 'Oh, Mrs. Hackett.' - Yes, Miss Fowler. 'Telephone the fashion show. Say I'm sorry to be late.' 'I'm leaving here immediately.' I'll attend to it, Ms. Fowler. 'I know you get paid by the picture' that's why you wanna take so many. I get paid by the job, Ms. Fowler. 'But my boss wants 20 new poses.' 'Could you have the head a little more to the left? 'Thank you.' Mother. What is it, young man? Oh, I-I have a letter here for Ms. Fowler. It's a very special letter and has to be delivered in person. I'll take it, please. No! Well, there's-there's nothing in it that a girl's mother shouldn't read. So, I guess it's alright. What is it, mother? Nothing, my dear. Come with me, please. - With you? - This way. You-you know, Ms. Fowler, it's gonna be a real pleasure to make your daughter's acquaintance. I'm afraid it won't be as simple as that. See, my daughter has a great many demands upon her time and energy. She can't accept all the friendship offered. And, well, friendships aren't established by letters of introduction. They aren't? No, you see... friendships come as a result of knowing the same people, liking the same things. Having common bonds of mutual interests. Well, you mean, that I-I couldn't have a mutual interest with your daughter? I'm afraid not. You mean, I'm not her social equal? Well, let us just say that your paths seem to go in different directions. Well, you know, me, that is, my family and me.. We're... we're very nice people. - Honest, we are... - I'm sure of that. But there are millions of nice people in the world and, well, Daphne can't be friends with all of you. - You see, what I mean. - Yes, I-I see. You mean... there's no special reason why I should be friends with your daughter. That's it. And, an awfully good reason why I shouldn't. Well, I'm sorry, but you know, back from where I come from everybody has a mutual interest in everybody else. Of course... goodbye. Goodbye. Oh, I... I hope I didn't cause you any trouble. Not at all. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Andy... Andy, darling, what's the matter? I just aged 50 years. Well... what happened just now? That's right, I promised I wouldn't ask any questions. What happened to me is a secret I'll carry to the grave. 'Where to Ms. Booth?' Anywhere. Anywhere where I can find some peace. Grant's Tomb, Prentiss. "Let us have peace." General Grant, you and me both. Well, let's go on inside maybe the coffins will cheer you up. It's a fine world. Back in Carvel, there are people waiting to laugh at my funeral. Here in New York, they got coffins to cheer me up. Oh, I'm sorry. I only meant that, maybe the coffins would make you be glad just to be alive. Yeah. There's something in that. There's-there's something, but not much. Isn't it impressive? Now, don't you feel glad just to be alive? I never before appreciated the vantage of being dead. Oh, Andy, couldn't you tell me your problem? I-I'm a woman and maybe I could help. I can't tell anybody. Tragedy is gnawing at my vitals. But I can't tell anybody. But you mustn't give up. Look at Ulysses S. Grant. He didn't give up when things looked the darkest. He never had any trouble like I got. All he had on his hands was a civil war. Well, then, you pretend that all you have is a civil war. Andy, can't you tell me what your trouble is? Did General Grant talk or did he act? Then, you won't surrender. You'll-you'll plan a new campaign? Betsy, I shall search out the enemy's weakest point and make use of strategy. If I'm late for lunch, all the strategy in the world won't help me with my dad. Come on. James. Oh, hello, Milly. Well, how's the big fur coat deal coming along? Emily fall for it? I've got Emily fooled. She thinks the coat's for me. So far, she says they're all too young or too expensive. Well, you keep at it. I wanted her to have a good fur coat all her life. Don't let on it's for her till we get home. I won't. She'd pop back to the store and exchange the coat for a new kitchen stove. - Oh, James. - Hmm? How's your orphanage business working out? Wonder if the children are home. Milly, I've been twice to the plush-lined offices of Daphne, Court, and Underwood but it appears the mighty Mr. Underwood's away on a shooting trip. No one else in the office seems to know what it's about or even think it's important. So, I'm going to court and force a little action. Good. But don't tell Emily. She'll be worried. Hello. Well, who do you think you are? Ulysses S. Hardy. In the matter of the Cyrus Carvel Estate vs. the Carvel County Orphanage Incorporated. Ready for the orphanage, Your Honor. Uh, ready for the estate. Uh, I'm Underwood. My office didn't tell me about this until your letter arrived. Sorry. Your name is Handy, isn't it? Well, no apologies are needed, sir, but the name is Hardy. Will you explain your petition, sir? To force the Cyrus Carvel Estate to resume supporting our orphanage. 'If it please the court' I can save the taxpayers a lot of money. Obviously, you are not aware of this amendment to the original agreement. 1931, signed by Harland W. Wyatt President of the Carvel Counties Orphanage Incorporated. At the worst of the depression, Wyatt demanded that we switch the United States securities in the orphanage trust fund to European bonds. I see. Recent European developments, those bonds are worthless. 'Those European bonds defaulted'. The trust has no further obligation. This is Mr. Wyatt's legal acceptance of the exchange. The Cyrus Carvel Estate requests that you dismiss Judge Hardy's petition. Your honor, this is a shocking surprise. May I ask if this matter be continued until Monday? Which will give me time to consider my position. It is so ordered. 'We're happy, therefore, to bring you the voice' 'of the glamorous example of young American girlhood.' 'She, who has been called the number one debutante' 'of New York society, Ms. Daphne Fowler.' 'Thank you, Mr. Franklin. Ladies and gentlemen' 'as President of the Dog-lovers Society' 'I invite all dog lovers to a benefit we're giving' 'at the Club Sirocco.' 'The entire receipts of the Club Sirocco will go' 'to our fund for homeless dogs.' 'I, especially want to meet all the people who have with me' 'a mutual interest in the welfare of our little' 'four-footed friends.'

Yeah, I kind of thought it was small too but I didn't know how they're wearing 'em now in New York. But, you got a six and seven-eighths, didn't you? Oh, I got mixed up. I got a six and seven-eights glove and a five-and-a-half hat. - No, what are we gonna do? - Oh. My dad's. Gee, that certainly was a narrow escape. New York must be full of midgets.

Most likely, the food here is different than that of Carvel. So, maybe you could tell me how to order a magnificent dinner. Oh, I'm afraid I couldn't. But I heard my dad say once that if you wanna go to a strange restaurant and get the best food just ask the waiter for the specialty of the house. Specialty of the house, huh? Thanks a lot, Betsy. Thanks a million. - You've been simply grand. - Oh, it's nothing. You couldn't have done more for me had you been an adult my own age. Oh, gosh. I don't wanna be late. Where's my coat?

That's right, sir. This is her table here. Uh... what time do you expect Ms. Fowler? Not until later. Ahem. Your shirt stud, sir. Huh? Oh. 'Will you order now, sir? Some hors d'oeuvre, perhaps?' I'll just take the specialty of the house. That'll be caviar Romanoff au tortoni. I-I'll have a double order, then. And after this, what will monsieur have? Oh, just continue, my man. The specialty of the house. Shall I carve it, sir? Yeah, yeah. Say, waiter Isn't it pretty near time for Ms. Fowler to arrive? Later, I believe. For dessert, sir, may I suggest another specialty? Your judgment is beyond reproach. We call this bomba la Corsican. Ah, ice-cream with a French accent. You look like a man who needs a dog very badly. A dog? A worthy charity. I'll buy one. Each one autographed by Ms. Fowler in person. Ms. Fowler? Is she here? Well, not until later, I believe. Oh. $20, please. - $20? - Yes, sir. Oh, no. No, no, thank you. I mean..that is, I just noticed that the little dogs, they were made of fur and I'm very allergic to fur. No, thank you. Imagine charging $20 for a little ten cent dog like that. Why, at that rate, they charge you... well.. Waiter. Uh, excuse me. Something else, sir? How much is it costing me for this dinner? 3.75, $4, $12, uh, in between $35 and $40, sir. 30 or 40? Yes, sir. Anything else, sir? Yes. You can take me to see the proprietor. He said he was Judge Hardy's son. And I don't want to offend anyone connected with a judge. I don't seem to recall any Judge Hardy in this city. My-my father's Judge Hardy of Carvel. What's Carvel? Some little hillbilly town? We're not hillbillies. We-we wear shoes every day. Oh, that's a big help. And dress suits every night, too? I... I rented this. 'Putting on a big-front, huh?' You also told Fred here, that you were a friend of Daphne Fowler's. I did not. I just asked... if she was coming. I've never exactly met Ms. Fowler. Just an all round four flusher. You should've seen the way he ordered. He didn't even glance at the menu. You could've at least looked at the prices, couldn't you? Yes. But you wanted everybody to think you were a big shot? I guess I did. Well, what are we going to do about this 37 dollars and 25 cents? Well.. I've got $8. Maybe I could... work out the balance by washing dishes or I could.. Or I could send you a dollar a week. Please, don't send me to jail, will you? You don't wanna bring your poor father down in gray hairs to his grave, eh? He's pretty gray-haired already. Bub, I know your type. You're just a small-town sport. 'Not dry behind the ears yet.' 'Cause you were king of the kids in your own hometown 'you've got delusions of grandeur.' When I was a boy, we used to call your kind too big for their britches. 'But I don't think you even rate jail.' 'I think you need a good spanking.' Fred, put bub in a taxi. Be sure the driver gets the right address. Come on, son. Oh, come in. Come in, Betsy. Good morning. May I see Andy, please? He must've got in pretty late last night. We were asleep. Oh, well, I won't wake him then. Oh, boy, he must've had a big night last night. It's time for him to get up. Andrew. Andrew! Wake up! It's Betsy Booth. Good morning, Betsy. Good morning, dad. Morning, son. Gee, you sure look like a gorgeous wreck. Come in, please. Tell me all about it. Andy, what's wrong? I don't care to discuss it, Betsy. I'm sorry, I... I brought back the clothes. Yeah, I... I packed the dress suit there. I was going to bring it back.. At present time, I don't care to come in contact with my family. You've been simply wonderful to me but I... I don't care to talk about anything now. You know what I mean? Yeah. Well, I.. I hope I'll be seeing you when you feel better. Yeah, sure. I'll-I'll call you.. As soon as the world is normal again. If it ever is. Alright. My father's shirt stud. It's in here alright, isn't it? Uh... the stud, ye.. Well, uh, Betsy, it was a little loose and I thought maybe I'd have it fixed before I brought it back. Oh, fine. My father's very keen about that stud. Paid $400 for it. Bye, Andy. Four hundred dollars? Bye, Judge Hardy. And don't be worried about Andy and me being mysterious. What I'm worried about, isn't Andy. Bye. Or maybe it is. Some mail for you. It's from Polly Benedict and F. Baker Anderson. F. Baker Anderson, I presume is, Beezy? Yeah. Bad news? Andy, I have problems of my own.. But I'd like to help you if I could. Huh. You can't. You... can't help with this. Help with what? Oh, it's... it's not your fault, dad. No more than it is mine. You being born what you are and... me what I am. Mm-hm. What are you? Dad... why couldn't our family have had money.. Family trees and you know, that kind of stuff? Well, you have a family tree. You've got parents and grandparents and great grandparents like every living soul in the world. - It's not what I mean. - Well, what do you mean? Why couldn't we have had class, money and social position? Why couldn't we have been somebodies instead of nobodies? For the first time in my life, I realized I'm not as good as somebody else. You do, eh? You, eh, get your hat and coat and... come with me. What's this place? This is the Hall of Fame at New York University. Dedicated in humble tribute to "Mighty men which were of old. Men of renown." I brought you here to show you some nobodies that turned out to be somebodies. I never thought I'd hear you, my own son deny the very soil you walk on. Soil that was earned for you by the blood and tears of men who said that, "All men in America should be equal". Equal? It's funny. Well, equal in that they shall all have equal opportunities. Alexander Hamilton. Patrick Henry. Andrew Jackson. They left you a heritage of freedom and equality. A heritage you should fight to keep. Instead of kicking it around and sniveling about class money, social position. What's that gotta do with the fact that I've to go back to Carvel and face the worst punishment a guy had to take? Punishment. There's a man over there. 'Born a poor boy.' 'He took quite a bit of punishment.' That was a fine a 100 years ago when a guy had a chance.. '...but, now there's millions of people like us..' I don't wanna talk about it. You never will understand. Ah. You've reached that age, eh? What's age got to do with it? Back in a little tank town like Carvel I might be king of the kids, but here in New York I'm just a small-town hick with delusions of grandeur and you're just a country judge that nobody ever heard of. When a boy's stupid... he's just stupid, that's all. Come on home. Reduced to these basic chemical elements, therefore the human body has a commercial value of about 90 cents. I'll sell out cheaper. Name five of those elements, Andrew. Calcium, sodium, phosphorus, iron, hm.. Misery, I guess. Andrew... have you had a row with your father? I thought so. That's why I suggested your lessons instead of your going with him to see the Statue of Liberty. Headache no better, dear? The orphanage case? Yeah. You know, it got me licked. And all because Harland Wyatt lost faith in his own country. Oh, those poor children. I was so sure that I've come to New York to show them a thing or two. I guess this town's too big for me. Oh, don't dear, please. Come on, you two. We can see it beautifully now. Any city that doesn't appreciate my husband I don't think much of and I wouldn't hesitate to tell it to the Mayor himself. Well.. I'd think that every man, woman and child in America would be grateful for what that stands for. - Flame of liberty. - Flame? Uh, James, even if our home is just a little house in a little town, there'd be something in the New York papers if it burned down, wouldn't it? Mother. Is the gas under your coffee pot all that the Statue of Liberty means to you? No, James Hardy. It isn't. It means that people can't get together behind somebody else's back and conspire to take away their privileges. Not bad, mother, not bad. Take away their privileges, huh? Take away their privileges? Why, of course, why didn't I think of that? Think of what? Mother, you just said "conspire behind their back to take away their privileges". I believe you've saved the orphanage. Now, listen. I'm going to hop a plane, fly back to Carvel. So, Marian, you have Andrew down to the courthouse Monday morning at 9:30 with my briefcase and papers.. Cyrus Carvel Estate vs. the Carvel County Orphanage Incorporated. If it pleases the court, I am Judge Hardy's son. He told me to meet him here at 9:30 and it's past 10. He's gotta be here soon. We'll give him every opportunity. I ask the court's pardon for being late. There is one essential point of law. An agreement entered into by two parties for the benefit of the third party cannot be amended without the consent of the third party. And the third party specifically mentions in our original agreement.. I quote.. "The creation and maintenance of the Carvel Orphan's Home "for the benefit of all homeless orphans of Carvel under the age of 18 years." I would like to amend my petition to name a new petitioner. And who is the new petitioner, Judge Hardy? Just a minute, just.. Your Honor, this is the new petitioner. One of the homeless orphans of Carvel under 18 years of age. With the court's permission, I'd like to question the petitioner. Francis, did you ever sign an amendment to the original trust agreement between the Carvel Orphan's Home and the trustees of the estate of Cyrus Carvel? No, Your Honor. No, Your Honor. It is our contention that Mr. Underwood is, therefore obligated to put back the United States securities eliminated by the amendment and to continue payments 'to the Orphanage.' Your Honor, please, I don't think that I would care to oppose this new petitioner before a jury of 12 good Americans and troops. And if Your Honor will consent to a further adjournment I am certain that we can work out an arrangement satisfactory to everybody. So ordered. Now, how does that strike you, Francis? You said a mouthful, toots. Off the record, I should like to remark that in my opinion, Judge Hardy has also said a mouthful. 'Certainly, nobody in this country wants to see' 'helpless orphans left uncared for.' Most admirable, Judge Hardy. - Thank you, sir. - 'Next case.' How about my club for lunch, Judge Hardy? I don't want a club. Well, what do you want, sonny? My name's Butch and I wanna go back there. Oh, what for? I wanna watch His Honor, in the black nightshirt. Well, I suppose, I take Butch home for the day. My wife and I haven't had children about for 30 years. Well, think you'd enjoy him for a day? I think I would. And... speaking of children, what's become of your son? Forgot all about him. Well, I think he went on home. Well, I'll have the youngster home by sundown. Goodbye, Butch. Goodbye, toots. Dad.. Yes. Dad... I just wanted to tell you how proud I am. You showing up that Mr. Underwood. That's not the real point. They say he makes over a million dollars a year. Did you notice that the court treated me with equal consideration? Millions or not. They did, didn't they? And the real point is that I had an opportunity to win. A small-town judge with no social position had an opportunity equal to the big city lawyer. An opportunity guaranteed by the law itself. The mighty men of old made this that kind of a country. And that kind of a country, God willing, it always will be. Dad, you.. You probably won't forgive me. You shouldn't ever. I don't deserve to be your son. What I'm wondering is do you deserve to be any decent American's son? Gosh, I-I don't know what got into me. I guess I was led astray when I put all my faith into General Grant and he stabbed me in the back. Yes? It just goes to show you what'll happen to a man when he lets love blind him to the principles of democracy. Love, again, Andrew? Yeah, love. I know it doesn't sound very logical starting out with love and ending up losing a $400 pearl stud. A $400 pearl? Well, I think during this subway ride we better have a serious man-to-man talk. Yes, sir. But this time, start at the beginning, the very beginning. Well, the beginning was when debutante started to wear strapless evening gowns. There, there. Well, that'll do as a beginning. Go on. Oh! - Hello, Andy. - Hello, Betsy. Come in. Andy, you didn't call me all day today. Are you mad at me? I'm mad at the world. I've got more troubles than anybody since Job in the Bible. I wouldn't be surprised, if, by tomorrow, I got boils too. Oh, you and trouble just naturally gravitate to each other, don't you? If you're worried about losing the pearl stud.. I'm not going to tell anybody about your worrying. How did you know I lost it? You weren't a very good actor, Andy. Now do you feel better? I'm in more trouble than that. Why, I don't dare go back to Carvel. I'd be the joke of the town. Little children would follow me down the street, laughing. Won't you please tell me about it, Andy? It can't do any harm. And besides, sometimes a woman's intuition is better than a man's brains. Well, Betsy, back home, I got a crush on a girl who lives here in New York. Oh. - Oh, that's bad. - 'That's nothing.' I kind of boasted around to some people in Carvel that.. That she liked me. - Doesn't she? - I never even met her. 'Then I got double-crossed.' I got double-crossed right in the bosom of my own family. My father makes me come to New York. I... I don't get it. I've to get a picture of her and take it home to prove that she's crazy about me or.. Or maybe I can bury myself on a South Sea island. I suppose, she's awful pretty. Yeah, I guess so. But, you know, Betsy I don't think of her as being a real person anymore. She's... she's more-more like a ghoul. You understand? No, I don't if you've got a crush on her. But I haven't... anymore. I... honest, Betsy, I haven't. I've got to get her a Blaine picture, or I'll be ruined. That's all she means to me now. Yeah, but maybe if you really met her you'd go crazy about her again. No, what I've been through has knocked all of that out of me. Oh. What's her name? Daphne Fowler. Daphne Fowler? Yes, the number one debutante. Oh, wonderful! Hey, are you nuts? Why are some men so dumb? Why didn't you tell me this before? Tell you what? Hello, Stevens. This is Ms. Booth. May I please speak to Ms. Fowler? Thank you. - You know Daphne Fowler? - Of course, I do. Hello, Daph. Daph, this is Betsy. I'm swell, Daph. Say, listen, I wanna bring a friend of mine to your debut, Monday night. Oh, he's a swell guy. He's an old friend of mine. Thanks, darling. Are you gonna wear that new black strapless evening dress you tried on last week? Of course, I would. It's stunning. Alright, darling. I'll tell you all about my friend later. Bye-bye. Well, that's settled. Out of the mouths of babes. She's a real girl. Without her make-up on, she hasn't more glamour than I have. She hasn't? Mm-mm. Especially, when she's not dressed up. Like on botany trips. Daphne Fowler likes botany? Mm-hm. Only, uh, she doesn't get much fun out of it because flowers always give her hay fever. Hay fever, huh? See, she's kind of susceptible to it because she's anemic. In fact, she's so anemic, she wears long woolen underwear. Long woolen underwear? Gosh, it... makes me feel kind of funny. I know. Whenever I get disillusioned, I always get a pain in my stomach. Is Ms. Betsy Booth here? They told me at her home, she might... - I'm, uh, I'm Betsy Booth. - From the insurance company. Your butler reported a valuable pearl stud missing. Oh, well, I loaned it to a friend. I'll-I'll wire him right away in Chicago and have him send it back. Have your butler let us know when the pearl is returned. Then we won't have to notify the police. Police? So, that's the whole story, Judge Hardy. Naturally, I didn't want the kid's dollar a week. Oh, I know you don't, Mr. Carrillo. You'd be doing me a favor. Oh, no. The show was worth the price of admission. At $2 a week out of his allowance.. My son'll have reason to remember New York city for a long, long time. '37 dollars and 25 cents.' I get the idea. Can I send some champagne around to your wife? Oh, no, thanks. There is one thing. Somewhere in his adventures my son lost a very valuable pearl stud. This one? Well.. There she is, Andy. The number one glamour girl. Are you sure she doesn't make your heart get jittery? Nope, not a jitter. I'm kind of fed up on glamour. I'm going back to the nice old-fashioned girls. You know, the girls who can look up to a man. Hello, Daph. How are you? Oh, you're a knockout in that strapless number. I'm freezing in it. This is Mr. Hardy? Yes. May I present Mr. Andrew Hardy. One of nature's noblemen. I'm most happy to make your acquaintance, Ms. Fowler. Greetings, Mr. Hardy. From one dog-lover to another. Mother, you remember Mr. Andrew Hardy? How do you do? I'm glad you came. Yeah, me too. Shall we go in, Andy? See you later, Daph. Andy, Betsy's told me the amazing story of your life. So restrain yourself until the sixth dance... glamour boy. There's my pet photographer. Guaranteed not to let your eyes squint. Oh, gee, Daph, you're swell. Remember, party doesn't get good until after mob goes home. Come on. Come on, Betsy. We're going to get that photograph. Lead on, Andy. Betsy, I've been working on Andy. And he's really crazy about you but he doesn't know it yet. When the party simmers down, I'll start telling you to sing and you turn it on hot. I've got a song, but if it doesn't wake Andy Hardy up he must be made out of concrete. ♪ I woke up this morning and the sun was shining ♪ ♪ But I didn't see it ♪ ♪ Think I drank my orange juice ♪ ♪ But I don't know I wouldn't guarantee it ♪ ♪ Wore my yellow dress Or was it blue? ♪ ♪ Oh what's the use?

Please, give us one more song. Just one more. Oh, gee, Betsy. You were terrific. Oh, thanks. - Let's get out of here, huh? - Sure. I'm gonna show you something, here in New York that millions of people never see in their lifetime. What? A horse. Come on. You don't suppose, something will happen that'll keep you from going home tomorrow? No, we-we have our tickets. It's alright for you to stay this late? You know, it's getting dark. I'd stay out even if it wasn't alright. I wouldn't let you. Your mother expects me to take care of you. It gives me the nicest feeling. Do you know, I-I wish I wasn't leaving New York. Oh, we can write to each other. Yeah. And every time I get a letter I'll pretend you're sending me gardenias. Like these. I'm getting too old for pretending. I will send you gardenias. Only, not right away on account of that allowance trouble that I told you about. - You-you cold? - No, I'm not cold. It's... it's just like Indian summer. Really? You know, you've-you've changed a lot since the last time you were in Carvel. I have? 'Yeah, you're-you're more grown up and..' Well, gee, I'd completely almost forgot how swell you were. Maybe, I wasn't as swell when I was in Carvel. Maybe, you just didn't notice. One thing about me hasn't changed though. No boy has... has ever kissed me yet. You know, I.. I was sittin' here thinking that I... I wanted to. I wanted to kiss you. Then, when I think that I do, then I'm afraid that I don't. Don't want to? Well, sometimes wanting to and not wanting to is better than wanting to. I know. I knew you were thinking about kissing me. I was just as afraid you would as much as I was afraid you wouldn't. Gosh, this is... this is much too important to be monkeying around with. I'll remember that, too. So, we can see each other again. Betsy.. I'll come back some day. If you mean that.. Maybe, you better kiss me. Even if we both don't want to. Some day. Betsy. Hey. Don't cry. Well. I know why you're crying. You're crying, because-because I kissed you. Look, it-it isn't that glamorous to cry. It's funny when a, when a girl cries because you-you like her. 'Why..' Why, even when her nose is shiny, she's glamorous. Oh, boy! That's what I call glamour. I'll bet you.. Bet your Polly Benedict, couldn't be glamorous with a shiny nose. Polly Benedict? Huh, you wait till I get back to Carvel. Well, New York is wonderful. It's always good to get home. Excuse me, I've to fix my hair. Excuse me too. I've got a couple of predatory insects to destroy. Ah, save me a trip. Will you, son? Drop Francis off at the orphanage. Oh, dad, I'm too big to be cartin' around babies. Too big for your britches? I'm sorry. What a lotta grief you're gonna go through before you're my age. - James? - Hm. - There's no coffee. - Now, now, mother that.. Oh, ha-ha-ha. Wasn't that silly to worry? I remembered what I told Andy to cancel the milk. Well, don't worry about the milk. I've personally told the milkman not to leave any. Hello, Polly. Have you seen your advance copy of the Olympian? No, I haven't yet. But it's here. I'll look at it right away. Hold the wire. I saw it. I.. But how could it ever have happened? Oh, what are we gonna do? Listen, I'll meet you at the school right away. Oh, Andy had the cover changed. But how did he dare? Oh, Beezy, he did know that girl. What awful idiots we've been. Cynthia Potter warned me. Andy kissed her when he took her out. I should have known better, than to trifle with him. Beezy. Maybe, he's been secretly married to that Daphne Fowler, all the time. Andy Hardy. Who's baby is that? I remember you, sister. You're the little girl that failed in geometry. It was to protect his future that we went to New York. What? Oh, the orphanage. Hey, look, I thought, I was dreaming but they're all the same. You printed up the story and I supplied you with an exclusive cover. And it's not faked either. I trust that the younger generation of this town has learned to respect it's elders. I'm sorry, Andy, I take back everything I said. - I'll apologize in writing. - Not necessary at all. Bub, you're just too big for your britches. Take Francis back to the orphanage for me. Yes, sir. I mean, yes, Andy. Come on. You and me, will stop at Cynthia Potter's. She's just crazy about babies. Yes and a mouthful, toots. So, Daphne Fowler was in love with you all the time. Well, there's our picture there. Society's number one glamour girl. Trying to coax me for a smile. Ah, swell girl, Daph, sort of a adolescent Cleopatra. Perhaps, you are too mature for me. No doubt, no doubt. When I was in New York, I was thinking sophisticated girls may make you appreciate old fashioned girls. You know, the type that starts to cry when you kiss 'em. Ah... are you engaged to Daphne Fowler? Daphne? Oh, no, no, no. Just another milestone in my career. You know, you used to be a sweet, unaffected little child. And I always thought that you kinda looked up to me. I do, Andy. I think, I think, I should cry right now if you were to kiss me. Ah, then, that-that's a good idea but of course, you don't wanna go to extremes. When you kiss a girl, as I was telling Betsy. Betsy? It-it slipped. It slip-slipped out. Uh, can I help it if I have irresistible charm? That's not charm. That's polygamy. But, oh, Andy, how we women love it. James, it's lovely. - You really like it? - Oh, it's beautiful. And since you want us to end up in the poor house, I'll keep it. James, you're the best husband that ever lived. Gosh. How once women do mount up.
