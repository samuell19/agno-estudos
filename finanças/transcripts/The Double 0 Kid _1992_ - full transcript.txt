Yeah, that's not the point, is it? How did you know I was here? That's all part of the job. (gun clicking) (water squirting) This job's gone straight to your head. What? - Nothing. - What'd you say to me? Nothing. Get out. [Boy] I'm going. Out. [Boy] I'm going.

[Lance Voicover] East German immigrant. - Female. - Cranberry. [Lance Voicover] Disguised as cross-country ski expert has infiltrated safe house. (laughs) Why don't you drop in? (shutter clicking) (electronic beeping) (birds singing) Lance? Are you listening to me? (phone clattering) - Lance? Lance? Can you do something with your brother? Can you do something with him? Just tell him that I love him. Sometime when you're alone, alright? Are you listening? (objects clattering) (birds singing) (footsteps thudding) (door creaking) (slamming) (pages rustling) Lance? Lance, honey? I know you're up there, (birds singing) so there's no point ignoring me. I won't say a word, dear. Nothing. But can you come to breakfast once a week? Or once a month? Or something? (footsteps thudding) (soft rustling) (birds singing) I want to talk to you, is that wrong? I want to talk to my son. (birds singing) (suspenseful instrumental music) Hey, you can't take my bike. Mom, Lance is stealing my bike! (suspenseful instrumental music) Eagle Don escapes from Interrogation Center. Headed to Mission Headquarters.

(suspenseful instrumental music) [Lance Voiceover] Red alert, red alert! Enemy vehicle in pursuit, closing in fast. [Boy] I'm warning you, stop! Lance, come on, you're gonna break it! (suspenseful instrumental music) (car horn honks) I don't know what's gotten into you, young man! You stop that bike! (suspenseful instrumental music) Stop that bike right now! (suspenseful instrumental music) (phone ringing) Good morning, sir. (phone ringing) You're late. Four minutes, 23 seconds. Look, I was being chased. People in station wagons were chasing me. I had to lose 'em, and I had to take a detour here. - Get some coffees. - Sure. - Mine is straight black. - Of course it is. Well, I'll send the files over. (door clicking) I'd like to get moving on the Harrison case. Wednesday. 11:30. (phone clicks) Yes, Trout, what is it? We need a signature. Additional surveillance equipment. Well, I have permission to extend the duties of the summer recruitment program. Pamela, I don't know why you're so obsessed with these kids. Now, don't get me wrong. I think the program is a great idea. The kids spend the summer off the streets, good experience for them, but don't you think you're taking this a bit too seriously? What about this young kid, Lance? I don't know. There's something strange about this kid. Really? He's only been with us for three weeks. He's a bright kid. Give him a break. Maybe you're right. (door clicking open) (phone ringing) [Pamela] Oh, hello, Lance. Mrs. Lomax. (door slams) - Thank you. Sure. The one on the left. Why? Well, it's your usual, straight black. (spoon clinking) Did you spit in it? [Lance Voiceover] Lance, you sly dog. He fell for it. A combination of strip nine and carbon-10. Colorless, sweet-tasting death within seven seconds. Lance, we have a few (Trout gags) (Trout coughs) - How much sugar's in this? Oh, that's mine, I'm sorry. Four packets. Here you go. This one's yours, sorry. Lance, we have a few assignments we'd like you to do today. I'm putting you under Trout's supervision. [Lance Voiceover] Oh, this is bad. This is very bad. I should've poisoned him. We have a number of assignments for you. These early assignments are for character building. PDPD. Perception, Discipline, Patience. The three qualities of a solid agent. [Lance Voiceover] An assignment. Lance Elliot sent to Paris under the codename Eagle Don. Lance, you have a lot of potential. But you need to learn how to channel that energy in the right direction. [Lance Voiceover] The mission? Meet a girl under the Eiffel Tower. Her name, Charlene. Ask her is she has a tourist map of Nice. You'll know if she answers no. But I have a parrot named Buzz. Especially if you plan to join the agency. After all, that's what this summer program is about, isn't it? Lance. Are you ready to start? Absolutely. Yes. (sharpener whirring) (gentle instrumental music) Eagle Don joins forces with Charlene. Tonight, the mission begins at the Cafe Mar-suh-lee-ay. A romantic candle-lit dinner with red wine, passionate dessert. The mission is to find the parrot named Buzz. I suggest we start by searching her apartment. (gentle instrumental music) Cheers. (sharpener whirring) (gentle instrumental music) (engine rumbling) (birds chirping) (brakes squeal) I thought for years, for years I thought that perhaps you harbored some resentment against me. Oh, don't be silly, Rudi. We were both young, reckless. Look what you made out of my little idea. Out of a single home computer, you've built an empire. Oh, well, darling. We have a guest. Rudi Kseenbaum. Rudolph Von Kseenbaum. Rudi, it's certainly my pleasure. The pleasure is all mine. Well, you really don't need to get out, darling. So, Rudi, it's been about 17 years, I think, since we first became associated, and. I take it you obtained the FAA codes. Of course. Excellent. (briefcase clicking) Then we can proceed to the second stage. (footsteps thudding) (tape clicking) (birds singing) I have been hired by an international consortium of businessmen to create a very special computer virus. Well, you've come to the right place. We still have a lot of fun with computers. Boo boop. (laughs) (laughs) So I hear. A little bird told me that you were personally responsible for the March the 5th Michelangelo virus. Well, I'm impressed. That's not common knowledge. (remote clicks) [Narrator] Never before has our world come closer to the brink of destruction. An area of rainforest the size of a football field is being cut every minute. Carbon dioxide levels have never been higher. The UN Security Council has elected a Science Committee to produce the Green Alert Report. 153 countries have agreed to legislate the findings of the report in an effort to save the globe from what is certain to. Well, I know all that. So let's get to the interesting stuff. The consortium fears that the Green Alert Report and the subsequent legislation could seriously damage their business interests. Now, the Scientific Committee is presently engaged in a world tour. In two days' time, they will be flying from Brazil to Atlanta, and this is the plan. (thudding) The consortium would like a scientist to disappear unexplainedly in the Bermuda Triangle. Oh, that's a very nice tough. (laughs) That's where you come in. We wish to have this done by an untraceable, specialized computer virus. They are prepared to pay $12,000. I suggest we split it fifty-fifty. Seven for me, five for you. (laughs) (laughs) You haven't changed, Rudi. If the plane leaves in two days, that's a tough schedule. The fee's a little light. But it'll be a nice challenge, so I accept. You're a great sportsman, you know. But I'm not business. Let me show you something I've been toying with recently. May I leave this here? [Cashpot] Of course, we'll be right back! (games beeping) Yep. (laughs) This is my fun room. (laughs) Incredible. And you see, all these games are linked up to my central computer. (games beeping) Ah. (Cashpot laughs) Ah. Ha, ha! Yes, oh, this is a wonderful one. You just get in there next to Ursula. This is gonna kill ya. (Rudi laughs) It is great. Alright. (door slams) Isn't this fun? Absolutely. (laughs) How does it work? Well, put on your seatbelt. (seatbelt clicking) (beeping) I'm gonna put a quarter in here. (clicking) (playful instrumental music) (engine roaring) Isn't this fun? (Rudi laughs) (engine roaring) (playful instrumental music) (engine roaring) (tires squealing) (Rudi laughs) Whoa! (car horn beeps) (woman screams) (engine roaring) (tires squealing) (playful instrumental music) Whoa. (tires squealing) (glass shattering) (Rudi yells) (Rudi sighs) What kind of game is this? This brakes don't work. It's not a game. (creepy instrumental music) Why are you doing this to me? Oh, nothing personal. It's just good business. Have a nice trip, Rudi. (engine roaring) Help me! Help me, someone! (glass shattering) (light instrumental music) (Rudi groans) (light instrumental music) (tires squealing) (Rudi screaming) (loud banging) (engine rumbling) (door slams) (engine putters) (papers rustling) Pamela, you called? Oh. Yes. Have you heard from Wynberg yet? He should've received the package by now. Oh, I forgot to tell you. There's been a delay with delivery personnel. You mean he hasn't received it yet. Well, it'll arrive today for sure. What time? (dialing) Early afternoon. Good. Jim, early afternoon. (laughs) No, of course we didn't send it Federal Express. (beeping) About the tapes. We did a computer analysis on the Stylos tapes. They were definitely recorded under duress. Well, we thought he was a man. (door thuds closed) (footsteps thudding) Come here. Gimme those. I was gonna file those. I know, I know. Take this. This package contains highly confidential documentation, level three security. You shouldn't even be holding it. No. In fact, this is really the FBI's business. I shouldn't even be holding it. I need this delivered to Wynberg Mycronics in Los Angeles, and I want you to hand-deliver it to Sam Wynberg, no one else, okay? Okay. I've booked you on a 10:30 flight to LA. You're gonna arrive at 12:40. You catch a cab, and you deliver the package. Wynberg's is about 35 minutes from the airport. You depart LA at 2:30. You'll be back home by 10:30 tonight. - Okay. - Okay. (papers rustling) Now here is $200. So go to LA, come back. This was supposed to be delivered yesterday. The address is on the package. You'll be home before anybody realizes you've even left. Look, don't let on to anybody, - No. - Especially Mrs. Lomax. - Of course not. - Can you handle this? - Of course. Get outta here.

However, our mission is a most urgent one. True, sister. (dialing) There are two people here from St. Andrews parish for underprivileged children. I'm on a deadline. Have 'em come back tomorrow. I'm sorry, but we will be praying tomorrow. Bless you, bless you. I'm sorry, where were we, John? John, let me call you back a little later, okay? Bye. (clattering) Sister, Father. Well, ya caught me at a bad time. Well, this needn't take long. (suspenseful instrumental music) Is there something I can do for you? How about a donation to the church? Mr. Wynberg, we were thinking about something a little more specific. I don't understand. We wish to acquire an FAA security keycard from you. The church will pay generously. Oh, I'm sorry. I can't help you. - [Secretary] Mr. - Wynberg, a Lance Elliot is here with a package. Excuse me. Send him in. This'll only take a minute. (door clicks open) Mr. Wynberg, package for you, sir.

(suspenseful instrumental music) (keys clacking) (suspenseful instrumental music) (phone ringing) (suspenseful instrumental music) (machine whirring) (suspenseful instrumental music) (paper rustling) Delivered package. I think Wynberg is in serious trouble. Being pursued by a nun and a priest. Eagle. This kid's living on another planet. Did he make the plane? (keys clacking) Is he booked on any flights home? He missed the plane. He could be anywhere in LA. Shoulda nailed the little punk when you had the chance. Any relatives, friends, hotels? (keys clacking) (beeping) (keys clacking) (phone ringing) Yep. Yeah, we have a slight problem. We had to terminate. Also, a delivery kid dropped off a package, and we think that Wynberg slipped the key card to him. So you haven't got the key card? No, Lance Elliot must have it. Well, I assume that you'll be sorting it out. Of course. There's another problem. The airline computers require a thumbprint ID. Can't we generate the fingerprint from the police files? No time. It's 29 hours 'till we kick off. But I think we'll be alright. Our FAA contact agreed to sell us his thumbprint. So take this down. Meet a Dr. G. Radley at the Los Angeles Zoo tomorrow at 1:30 at the Chimpanzees. What is it? 1:30? And take $20,000. Alright. Consider it done. Okay.

You know, you almost got us killed. Yeah, but I didn't. You're fine and I'm fine. Yeah, well, thanks to me, because I saved us. You know, that little stunt you pulled. I could sue you. Or have you arrested, you know that? Let's see. Reckless behavior, disturbing the peace. Damage to private property. (bag rustles) Hey, hey, hey, wait, wait, wait. What do you want? Half. Half? I can't do that. Oh, no, you mean you don't wanna do it. No, no, I mean I can't do that 'cause it's not mine. Well, if it's not yours, then why did you just give me $300? (Lance sighs) Oh. I get it. You stole this money, and that's why those guys are chasing you. It's not as bad as it seems. I don't have time for this. I have to go. Can I have my money? Please? No, I wanna know what's going on. That's classified information. If I tell you, I'm gonna have to kill you. (light instrumental music) Hey, where you going? I can't say. Why not? It's confidential. Well, I'm going with you. Okay. Good. (light instrumental music) (elephant trumpeting) (light instrumental music) (bird cawing) (light instrumental music) (elephant trumpets) (light instrumental music) (elephant trumpets) So who are we supposed to meet, anyway? I don't know. You don't know who we're meeting? No, not exactly. But I know when we see him, we'll know. You know, there must be something you're not telling me. I mean, for all I know, there could be like this drug deal going down or something. You're out of your mind. It's not a drug deal. (light instrumental music) (monkeys chattering) (people chattering) This is the time it said. Now all we have to do is look for someone suspicious-looking. (chimps chattering) (suspenseful instrumental music) That guy over there. (suspenseful instrumental music) (chimps chattering) Just stay here. (footsteps thudding) (chimps chattering) (chimp squeals) Jesus, Lance. What's going on? I mean, you don't know who you're supposed to meet, what for, or even where you're supposed to meet him. I mean, for all you know, it could be a her. Yeah, it could be, huh? (Melinda scoffs) I don't believe you. Excuse me. Excuse me. (suspenseful instrumental music) Shit. - Whoa! - Whoa! (both yelling) (footsteps thudding) (chimp squeals) Don't look back, don't look back. He was dead. Oh my god. He was dead. That explains why he missed the appointment. Yeah, but it doesn't explain why he was dead. (both panting) These guys are playing dirty. Oh god, his thumb was gone. Did you see that? Somebody cut his thumb off. That's one way of getting a thumb print. What? Forget it, nothing, let's just keep moving. Shit, Lance. I think somebody's following us. Don't look back. But I think someone is really following us. Yeah, I know someone's following us. You know? How long's he been there? Since the chimps. Oh my god, do you think he has a gun? Probably. Oh, shit, let's run. No, let's not run. Just be calm. We're gonna go right here and just hide, ready? Go, go, go, go! (suspenseful instrumental music) Freeze, dirt bag. You got a piece? (gun clicks) Turn around really slow. No, don't shoot. Don't shoot. Trout! Lance, Trout. What are you? The hell do you think you're up to? - What are you doing...? - Are you - completely out of your mind? - You know him? Did you hear me? I said get straight back. Nobody was to know. Now everybody knows. The FBI knows, I got Lomax all over me, my job is on the, Who is this? Melinda, Melinda, Trout. And your mother is completely hysterical. Trout, I'm onto something really big here. - Yeah, really big. - Forget it. I don't know what game you think you're playing, but it's over. I'm putting you on the first plane back. Just say goodbye to your girlfriend. - He's not my boyfriend. - She's not my girlfriend. What is the matter with you? What is this, what is this, what is this strange little espionage life? We're going this way. (birds chirping) (suspenseful music) Lomax is gonna have your job, my job. Don't tell Lomax. Tell her nothing. You better not have tried. - See! - Let's get out... Wait a minute, wait a minute. (suspenseful instrumental music) What are you doing? Come on. Wait a minute, Lance, Lance, come on. Stop this. Lance! (suspenseful instrumental music) Alligators! (upbeat instrumental music) (Melinda screams) (footsteps thudding) (suspenseful instrumental music) (footsteps thudding) (suspenseful instrumental music) (footsteps thudding) (men yelling) (alligator grunts) (bird cawing) (yelling) (suspenseful instrumental music) (man yelling) (suspenseful instrumental music) Why did you guys interfere? You made the kid run away. Who's the brat to you? Seamus Muh-goh-ick-uh-tee of zoo security. You wouldn't believe the kind of things that happen here. We're trying to protect the animals from reckless behavior, these kids that come, feeding the chimps with junk food. (elephant trumpets) (monkeys squealing) You guys got a problem here? (suspenseful instrumental music) It's getting a little crowded around here, hmm? Let's go. (suspenseful instrumental music) (car engine rumbles) (footsteps thudding) Lance, come on! Lance! Come on, get over here. Move it. We'll take care of you. Come on, get in here. Get 'em out out of here, now! Move it! (car engine roars) You okay? Yeah, think so. You? I'm okay. It was close. It was too close. - I hope that guy's gonna be alright. Who, Trout? It's gonna be fine. He can take care of himself. (Melinda panting) You know, I really wish you would let me know what's going on here. I'm with the CIA. I'm a new recruit. This right here, this is why we're being chased, okay? All that fuss for this? Well this, this breaks into some pretty heavy-duty computers. Sorry I drug you into all this. It's alright. It's actually been kind of exciting. (car engine roars) So what are you gonna do now? Probably go back to Philly and try to explain this whole mess. Yeah, well, I kind of figured things weren't going as planned. It could be worse. (light instrumental music) (gun clicks) So, where are we going? Excuse me. Where are we going? Shit. (popping) (popping) (suspenseful instrumental music) (car engine roars) We're at the zoo. Trout, now, listen to me very carefully. You found him once. You can find him again. It's gonna be difficult. And Trout, I don't need to tell you this is to be kept quiet, no FBI, no local cops. Just you and Lance. (phone clicks) (birds singing) (engine rumbles) (door clicks open) (heels clack on bricks) (door clicks open) (heels clack on bricks) (door squeaks) (computer beeping) (keys clacking) (switch clicking) (keys clacking) [Cashpot] Hmm. Hey, hey. (Melinda groans) You okay? Oh, where are we? I don't know. What happened? I don't understand. Those guys that picked us up in the limo, they weren't with the CIA. I mean, I should have known. Goddamnit, how could I have been so stupid? I thought they were with Trout. Obviously that's what they wanted us to think. (car engine rumbles) (doors click open) (doors thudding) (door slams) (shoes clacking on bricks) (briefcase clicks open) A six million dollar deposit. We will provide the remaining six when the plane crash is completed. Now, this is the part I enjoy. Is Rudi Kseenbaum joining us? Well, didn't you hear? He was crushed in a most unfortunate car accident. Just two days ago. (heels clacking) (speaking in foreign language) Well, darling. Sorry to be breaking up your little party, but we should be linking up in about 15 minutes. Well, Rhonda, this is Martin Luh-buh-son. And this is Mr. Tim Lacey, his associate. - Pleasure to meet you. - They've been sent by the consortium to observe our progress. I was explaining to Martin that we've had a slight delay. Yes, but everything is under control and on schedule. Well, let's go, then. Let's do it. Thank you, gentlemen. Shall I take care of this for you, sir? You keep a beady little eye on that, now, Eddy. Yes sir. (footsteps thudding) (door slamming) (footsteps thudding) (machine beeping) The children have woken. (machine beeps) Mr. Lance Elliot. I've waited for this moment. I am Cashpot. And your companion? Melinda. She's not a part of this, though. Well, of course she's not. And she'll be treated accordingly. (chuckles) (man laughs) Gentlemen, I would very much like you to meet my good friend Melinda, and secret agent in training, shh, Mr. Lance Elliot. I think you probably deserve to know what all this fuss has been about. (plane engine roaring) (satellite whirring) (beeping) The plane carrying the Science Committee is now flying approximately here. Well, in about seven minutes, the plane will be moving into the region known as the Bermuda Triangle. As we speak, these environmental scientists are probably being served lunch. Filet mignon, Crème de Champignon, and red wine sauce. Or perhaps some grilled sole squeezed with a slice of fresh lemon (laughs) Is there some point to all of this? As you know, I'm in the business of designing very specific computer viruses, and for today's operation, we have designed a virus to intercept the flying controls and cause the plane to crash. (men laughing) Mighty nice, eh? Rhonda will demonstrate. (keys clacking) (squealing) (beeping) Ah. (clapping) So you're gonna kill all these people? That's the general idea. (computer beeping) How can you do that? Those men are trying to save our environment. How sweet. You really are so naive. These praised scientists are only doing this for themselves. Not to help you. (laughs) Or the planet. And this virus? Yes, what about this virus? Well, if it's so powerful, you can infect other planes. So what is your point? My point is you'll be killing hundreds of innocent people. (laughs) Killing innocent people. You know, let me tell you something, my little friend. There's only one problem with this planet. Overpopulation. This world is a vortex of degradation. A cesspool of corruption and greed. Billions are starving, others are gorging themselves into a consumer oblivion. Man is the cancer of the globe. (laughs) And you're worried about a few thousand people dying in plain crashes. Well, personally, I don't give a shit. (beeping) Man, you need some serious help. Alright. That does it. (suspenseful instrumental music) (footsteps thudding) (suspenseful instrumental music) (door slams) (creepy laughter) [Melinda] No, no! Now this game, you have to find your way through the tunnels of the pyramid into Truh-ih-puh-tuh-on Commons Tomb. That sounds like fine. Oh, yes, it's great fun. Especially if you're not playing. (evil laughter) Wait a second, no practice round? Wouldn't do ya any good. No one's ever made it out of this room alive. Good to know. [Man] Welcome to Cashpot's Pyramid of Doom. (light instrumental music) (evil laughter) Crazy bastard. [Man] Naferatutu is your guide. Using your control, lead him through the passages of time, for only he can save you from the obstacles of doom. (footsteps thudding) (suspenseful instrumental music) (door creaking) (door slams shut) (clattering) (suspenseful instrumental music) Shit. (axes whirring) (game beeping) (machine beeps) Locking in satellite position. Locking in. Gentlemen, the excitement is about to begin. (grunting) (keys clacking) We've intercepted and have control of the satellite, gentlemen. (game beeping) (whirring) (ominous instrumental music) (rattling) (ominous instrumental music) (clattering) (ominous instrumental music) (Lance panting) (ominous instrumental music) Key card? Okay. Now to gain access to the airline communication system and wait for it to to track flight QS337. (card scraping machine) (beeping) (keys clacking) (beeping) (rattling) [Man] Congratulations. You survived the chamber of death and entered the royal tomb. But 3,000 years of purification have produced a highly toxic gas. (ominous instrumental music) (gas hissing) (ominous instrumental music) (creaking) (footsteps thudding) Sweet thing. Sorry I treated you so bad. Just doing my job. And now they're so busy up there, we can both use a little time out. (laughs) (shovel clanging) (man grunting) (ominous instrumental music) (whirring) (gas hissing) (beeping) Entering codes. (gas hissing) (clanging) (ominous instrumental music) (Lance panting) Now get me out of here! (beeping) [Woman] Codes accepted. The thumb? (clattering) (beeping) (thudding) (whirring) (beeping) We're in! (beeping) (clapping) - Ha-ha, yes! (beeping) Gentlemen, we've entered flight QS337's computer. (plane engine roaring) We're flying at an altitude of 31,266 feet at a speed of 617 miles per hour against a crosswind of 26 knots. Gentlemen, the world is about to witness another mysterious phenomenon. (beeping) Stand-by for virus transmission. (machine whirring) 10, nine, eight, seven. (loud whirring) Get the screens back. I have to see this. We've lost satellite communication. We've lost the link. What? How could that happen? Wait, shut down! Now, immediately! (man laughs) What happened? Just a precaution, gentlemen. A virus without a path through it might backfire into our own system. (man grumbling) It's the satellite. Oh. (laughs) Not to worry, gentlemen. It's a minor malfunction. Probably just a loose connection. (laughs) (keys clacking) (ominous instrumental music) It's him. It's Lance. He's destroying the satellite dish. How did he get out of there? This is impossible. It's impossible, it's impossible, it's (slapping) (ominous instrumental music) (whirring) (footsteps thudding) (ominous instrumental music) Get Tyler. The kid's out. Find him, shoot him on sight, squash him, cut him into a million pieces, I don't care what you do, just get rid of him. Now, this is outrageous. I didn't pay you millions of dollars to... Oh, will you stop bleating like a lost goat? It's all under control. See, gentlemen? Tea and strawberry scones in the computer room. Let's lock into the backup dish and continue. (keys clacking) (beeping) (ominous instrumental music) (gate squeaking) (gun clicking) (ominous instrumental music) We should've done this a long time ago. (footsteps thudding) (ominous instrumental music) (footsteps thudding) (Lance panting) We got to get out of here and get some help. Yeah, easy for you to say. They've got guys everywhere. - I know. - And they have guns. - I know. - And we don't. (sighs) I know. (ominous instrumental music) (gun clicking) (footsteps thudding) Ooh, I'm glad to see you kids are still hanging around. (Lance sighs) Ah. (keys clacking) Satellite link complete. Let's get back into the flight. (keys clacking) (beeping) (ominous instrumental music) Oh, my ankle. (man groans) (man screaming) (thudding) Hey! Hold it! (ominous instrumental music) Hey! (grunting) Hey! (locking clicking) (ominous instrumental music) Open the door! (banging) (loud clattering) Hey, what the hell's happening out there? [Man] It's Lance and the girl, sir. They've locked themselves in the games room. What do we do now? Well, they can't go anywhere. We'll deal with them later. (creaking) (playful instrumental music) Don't touch anything. (machine beeping) (keys clacking) (upbeat instrumental music) (playful instrumental music) (ominous instrumental music) Back up. (clanging) (ominous instrumental music) (keys clacking) (upbeat instrumental music) (ominous instrumental music) I don't get it. I'm trying to get access into Cashpot's computer. (upbeat instrumental music) (electronic whirring) (keys clacking) Cashpot. (upbeat instrumental music) (machine beeping) Locked in. (machine beeping) Okay. Let's proceed with virus transmission. Stand by. (ominous instrumental music) (keys clacking) (upbeat instrumental music) [Man] Opponent confirmed. Cashpot is not playing chess. Do you still want to play? (keys clacking) (upbeat instrumental music) (machine whirring) Oh, we got in. I can't believe we got in. How is that possible? You see, Cashpot, he linked up all these games to his main computer to make sure nobody could win. Aw, that's brilliant. (beeping) Transmitting the virus. (keys clacking) (beeping) Stop! Stop the transmission. Pawn to Queen four? What's going on here? (beeping) (upbeat instrumental music) It's our move. Move the knight. Knight to King four. Will you shut up? (keys clacking) (laughs) Cashpot! You little shit! Well, it's your move. (keys clacking) No, don't touch. You might confuse the computer. What happened? Will you shut up? (upbeat instrumental music) Now what? They're not moving. He'll move. He'll play the game. (beeping) - There's nothing we can do until he switches off that game. Should we interrupt the virus transmission? It's too late. The virus is in our buffer. It might leak into our own system. But if we move, we might be able to transmit while the kid's making his move, so let's move! Knight to king three. Pawn to queen four. - The pawn? - The knight. The knight? (keys clacking) (upbeat instrumental music) Oh, no. [Man] Transmitting virus. Yeah, they moved and they just gave us the virus. All we have to do is just move and give it right back to them, and let's do that. Look, you guys are making a big mistake. I will give each of you a million dollars. I think I'm gonna take your Queen out, Cashpot. No. Don't move. Just switch off that game. (keys clacking) No! That's a check. (ominous instrumental music) (beeping) (Cashpot sighs) The virus has infected our computer. (chess piece boinging) (ominous instrumental music) (beeping) (ominous instrumental music) [Man] Sir, there are some people at the gate. Tell 'em to piss off. As a representative of the consortium, I demand to know what's going on. (ominous instrumental music) Well, gentlemen, Rhonda have certain things that we're going to be dealing with, and we'll be back shortly. You can't leave. You can't abandon the mission! (man grunting) You're not going without us, - goddamnit. - Goddamn right, you're not. (ominous instrumental music) (gate whirring) (footsteps thudding) (ominous instrumental music) All units, we're in. (ominous instrumental music) Shawn, start sending the rest of your men in. Wait a minute. Your guys know Lance and the girl are in there? They're just fine. Tell 'em to be careful, will ya? I don't want those kids getting hurt. Will you relax? I've got the situation completely under control. Shawn, look out for the two kids. We want this as clean as possible. Freeze! (gun popping) (splashing) (gate creaking) Freeze! (rapid popping) They're shooting at us. Yes. (upbeat instrumental music) Lance, are ya in there? (men shouting) [Man] Hey, beat it! (rapid popping) (loud popping) Ahh! (upbeat instrumental music) (door clicks open) Hey, hey, this is my money! Six million dollars! (clicking) What? My god, there's a bomb in there. There's a bomb! (helicopter whirring) Come on in, let's go! (helicopter engine roaring) (ominous instrumental music) This way, come on! Close in fast! They're getting away in a chopper. Lance and the girl are in there somewhere. I got to go in. (helicopter whirring) (ominous instrumental music) (man yelling) (gate squeaking) (man grunts) (man screams) [Man] Freeze! [Man] On the ground, on the ground. (grunting) (helicopter whirring) (gun clicking) (footsteps thudding) Lance? (door crashing in) (clock ticking) Lance? (clock ticking) Lance? (helicopter whirring) You know, this isn't so bad. We've still got 6 million dollars. Sure do. And the beach house off the coast in Chile. When in Rome. Know it. But don't forget new identities. A bit of plastic surgery might help. Good idea. (laughs) I was thinking, what about banks in Monaco? Doesn't that have a nice ring to it? Monaco, banks. Sounds fabulous to me. (ominous instrumental music) (beeping) (light instrumental music) Lance? Lance, can you hear me? (beeping) (upbeat instrumental music) What does that mean? (beeping) (helicopter whirring) (phone ringing) Hello? Hello? (chess piece boinging) (chess piece boinging) (whirring) Who's that? I don't know. Hello? (helicopter whirring) Something wrong here. There's something wrong! We've been infected! Infected? - I'm losing control! - No! - We're going down. - No, no. (Cashpot whimpering) Do something! (helicopter whirring) I'm losing control! Help me out! Do something! (Cashpot screaming) (both screaming) (yelling) We're gonna do down! (woman yells) (woman screaming) (helicopter whirring) Going down! No! (helicopter whirring) (chess piece boinging) (chess piece boinging) (chess piece boinging) (men yelling) [Man] Come on, to the car! [Man] That means you're (footsteps thudding) You got to believe us. We had nothing to do with this! - Forced us into it! - [Man] In the car. Lance? (beeping) Lance, where are you? (car engines roaring) So, what's it like in Philadelphia?
