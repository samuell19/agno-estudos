No, not yet. I had to set up first. She's on her way to the house. Hey, I got this, okay? I'm doing it tonight. I think she's here. I got to go. ♪ Come to me, come to me ♪ Come to me, come to me ♪ Hey, baby. Mmm... Come in. Hey, let's go upstairs, all right? Oh, I thought we were gonna go see New Moon. It's supposed to start... No. My parents are out. Let's just stay in, right? And look, I got you this. What? Do you like it? I love it, it's beautiful. Thank you. Hey, you got your camera, right? Yeah... Good, because I want you to photograph me. Tonight, I will be your muse. Okay. You are so beautiful. Do you love me? Yeah. There's something I need to tell you. Okay. I'm a Nightwalker. Okay. What's a Nightwalker? It's like a vampire. I'm just gonna show you something. Okay. Hey, hey! I didn't choose to be like this. I, I don't know what you're talking about. I need to go. No. We chose you. Chose me? For what? The Nightwalkers, we chose you. Please just let me go. No, no, you are not gonna go. I love you. What are you talking about? Please, please. We can have this eternal bond, forever. I'm tired of killing. If I turn you, we could feed off each other forever. You're acting really crazy. Please just let me go. No! No. No, Pearl! Pearl, stop! Please, please, just leave me alone. Pearl. Get off of me! It'll be better for the both of us. I don't understand what you want from me. Please, come on! Please, just let me go! Come on. Ah! I never meant to hurt you. You're a Nightwalker now. And you are gonna thirst and kill until you find your one true love. Vampires and sexuality. Now, some argue that the insatiable thirst for blood, that makes vampires metaphorically sexual creatures. Bram Stoker. He takes vampires as a sex metaphor to a whole new level. He creates Dracula as a queer figure. So in contrast to Dracula, what sort of bond would Van Helsing have with his band of vampire hunters? Rodger? Heteronormative, yeah? At least, it seems that way. Right. So, their quest to end Dracula, it's also to re-affirm that their own homosocial bonds aren't queer. Violet? Okay, so then Dracula needed to be killed because of Victorian homophobia, but also because he was a murderer. Right. Yeah? What about Twilight? What about it? Well, the Twilight point of view is new, isn't it? I mean, it makes vampires good and, and cool. It makes everyone want to be a vampire. Do you want to be a vampire, Dan? All right. The Twilight books suck. They don't all suck. The first Twilight book was good, because it made teen sex dangerous again. Edward has to distance himself from Bella because of her blood and later, he won't have sex with her because he's afraid he'll get too excited and kill her. Interesting. I'd like to see where you're gonna go with this. In the past, teen sex was forbidden. A pregnancy out of wedlock was like death. But now, in our day, we have teen mom shows, and everyone can just use condoms. The first Twilight book was great because it equated teen sex with death again. And then they screwed it up in the later books when he starts holding out just because he's a "Victorian gentleman." And then they actually get married as teens to have sex which is just a way to cash in on teen sexuality while trying to seem morally responsible. It's absurd. Very interesting thoughts. You can all catch them, too, on Leah's podcast for pop culture. So, please, join it. You know what? I think we're gonna end on that. Your next reading chapters will be listed in the syllabus. Be careful of vampires. Goodbye. Have a good day. Hey, Leah! Leah, wait up! Oh, hey, Bob. Hey. Ready for auditions tonight? Oh, yeah. I'm a little nervous. Macbeth is tough. Yeah. You're gonna get Lady Macbeth. I mean, you're amazing. Thanks. So you ready for the, uh, country club Halloween party this year? My parents told me that your mom's been doing a lot of the planning? Yeah, she gets so into it. It's so embarrassing. Um, I'm gonna go study my lines, okay? Yeah, sure. Okay. I'll see you tonight? Yeah, yeah, yeah, of course. All right. You break a leg! Thanks. And all our yesterdays have lighted fools the way to dusty death. Out! Out, brief candle! Life's but a walking shadow. A poor player that struts and frets his hour upon the stage and then is heard no more. It is a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury signifying nothing. Great, Bob. Good job. I can tell you were working on that. Thank you. Thank you very much. Okay, thank you. Okay, is there, uh, is there anyone else for Macbeth? Leah. For, for Macbeth? Yeah, I would like to play Macbeth. Uh... Okay, fine with me. Give it a shot. - Just like we practiced. - Yeah. This'll be interesting. We will proceed no further in this business. He hath honored me of late and I have bought golden opinions from all sorts of people which would be worn now in their newest gloss, not cast aside so soon. I would. Prithee, peace. I dare do all that may become a man. Who dare do more is none. If we should fail... And we shall not fail. Bring forth men children only. For thy undaunted mettle should compose nothing but males. Will it not be received when we have marked with blood those sleepy two of his own chamber and used their very daggers that they have done't? Who dares receive it other? I am settled and bend up each corporal agent to this terrible feat. Away. And mock the time with fairest show. May false face hide what the false heart doth know. That was, um... That was something. Yes. All right, um... Ladies, that was, uh, that was interesting. Uh, two Lady Macbeths. I like it. Okay, good job. And good job, everyone. I'll post the results later this week. Really good work. So, how's it going in there? Fine. You know, I miss you being around more than just on laundry day. Mom, come on, at least I'm close. I could have gone out of state. And I'm just giving you a hard time. Oh... I wanted to show you the invitation. The invites went out this week. Looks good. I think it's gonna be even better than last year. You're gonna have a great time. You always do a great job. Oh, thanks, baby. So, how did the audition go? Good, I think. Isn't Macbeth, like, one of the bloodiest plays? So what? So, I don't know. Are you sure you want to be around all of that? Mom, it's a play. William Shakespeare. They do it in elementary school. I know that. But not everyone has been through what you've been through. I'll be fine. Okay. So, I was wondering if I can invite someone over for dinner on Friday night? Who? Um, just someone special I want you to meet. Leah. "Just someone special?" Of course, yes. That would be great. Don't make a big deal about it, okay? Who? Me? No. I got this. ♪ Baby ♪ Stop your chasing me ♪ Stop your staring, hungry eyes ♪ Give up your fantasy ♪ I'm not playing games... ♪ Is this okay? It is impossible for you to look bad. I still want to do a shoot outside the studio at some point. Why, you don't like it here? No, just... You never leave. I like my cave. I want you to come to dinner at my mom's. Yes, Leah. Please? It's time. I thought that you said your mom was super conservative. Yeah. She is. And weird and crazy. Sometimes I wonder if she's my real mom. We're so different. But it's important to me. I just don't get why you care so much what she thinks. I don't care. But I don't want to hide anymore. Okay. I have something for you. It's beautiful. What did I do to deserve this? I just want to thank you for being my muse. I love posing for you. Good, 'cause I want to photograph you forever. Oh, my God. What? I got Macbeth. Shut up. Yeah. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! That's awesome. Oh, my God. Oh, Bob's gonna be so pissed off. Who's Bob? Just this guy that has a crush on me. He got Macduff. Mmm. Doesn't Macduff kill Macbeth? Uh-huh. Yeah. I guess he'll have the motivation. Man, don't worry about that play. We got that huge party tonight. It's gonna be sick. There's gonna be so many chicks there. Yeah... Oh, man, so many. Yeah, dude, like, at least, like, 50 people are coming to the party. Yeah, it's gonna be a huge kegger. Hey, hey, hey, Bob, look. Your girlfriend's outside. Oh, holy shit. Looks like you've been barking up the wrong tree, buddy. You guys shut the hell up. Enjoy the peeping, Bob. What's going on, Pearl? What do you mean? Seems like you and Leah are getting awfully close. I'm still gonna do it. Soon. It shouldn't be taking this long. Why are you spending so much time with her? Because I'm making sure she's willing. Better if it's quick. We don't want you having any second thoughts. I won't. She's almost ready, I just don't want her to have a bad turn. You still owe us. Yes. I know. Well, we're waiting. Hi. Wonderful. First time she's on time in her whole life. Hi, hon. Hi, Mom. Are you early? Home cooking? Stop it. Raising you as a single mom most of your life didn't give me many opportunities for cooking lessons. You might want to put the oven on. Great. Yeah. So, what time is Bob coming? Bob. That's who's coming to dinner, right? No, Mom, it's not Bob. Who is it? Mom. This is Pearl. Hi. Hey. Thank you for making dinner. Yeah, no problem. We have some of Mom's homemade pie later. You know, to be honest, I, um... I kind of thought Leah was bringing a boyfriend over tonight. Oh... Sorry. So, Pearl, what do you study? Um... Pearl's a photographer. Really? - Yeah. Yeah, she practically lives at the photo lab at school. It's my second home. Is that what you want to do or... Yeah, it is. Wow. Mom. What? No, no, I... I think it's cute. You guys all want to be artists. My parents were actually photographers. I'm sure they're very proud of you. They're gone now. But... They were. Pearl, I'm sorry. That's... That's unfortunate. I'm sorry about that. No, it's totally okay. It's fine, it happened a long time ago. Well, I'm sure Leah's told you about her dad. We're no strangers to loss. No, she didn't. He was murdered six years ago. It was in Florida, this psycho was on the loose with a gun, and it was Thanksgiving, and he went to the grocery store to get some last-minute things, and the guy came in and started shooting. I had no idea. I'm so sorry. That's why we moved to California. Right. Um, how about we lighten the mood? Why don't I, uh, go get that homemade pie I've been working so hard on and some coffee? Yeah? Yeah. Mmm-hmm. Yeah, thank you. Be right back, girls. Are you okay? Yeah, I'll be fine. This is just so weird. You didn't tell her? Not really. I'm so sorry I didn't tell you about my dad. I don't talk about it. Mmm. I get it. It's okay. Thank you. Well, you must be a pretty incredible woman to have raised a girl like Leah. Aw, thank you so much. Think I got pretty lucky. Thankfully, she's had so many great friends to help her out along the way. This is great. Now we can add you to that list, Pearl, right? You know, it's funny. Between us girls, I'm actually really nervous for the day that Leah brings home a boyfriend from college. Mom? What? The reason I told you someone special was coming over is because... Pearl is special. To me. Pearl is my girlfriend. This is just news to me, you know. I, uh... I don't know. I didn't know how to tell you. Yeah, you just did. Yeah. I'm sorry, I, uh... Just... I'm feeling a little tired, and I think this is just... Just too much for me to handle right now. So, uh... Leah, please. Mom... Thank you for coming over. Thank you. Lovely. Thank you. Thank you for having me. Goodnight. Double, double, toil and trouble. Fire burn and cauldron bubble. Thrice the brinded cat hath mewed. Thrice and once the hedge-pig whined.

Open, locks, whoever knocks. Like a hell-broth, boil and bubble. I did not direct that. Leah. Hey. What are you still doing here? Can I walk you home? No, I'm going to meet someone. I can't catch a break. What do you mean? What do I have to do, Leah? You don't have to do anything. It's not about you. Well, what is it? Just tell me. I'm in love with someone. Who? Is it that girl? What? I saw you kissing a girl outside of your dorm. Do... Do you like women? Have you been following me? No, I'm not following you. Oh, you're a creep! Hey, Leah! Get off. How's our little newbie doing? I'm fine. Still taking your little photos? Yes. We're going hunting tomorrow. - Be ready. - Mm, okay. You're hungry, aren't you? Yes. Good. Hello? BOB: Uh, hi, Ms. Lewisson? Yes? Hi, this is, uh, Bob Segal. Oh, Bob. Hi. What can I do for you? Um... Well, this is hard to say. It's about Leah. Oh, no. Is this about that girl? Oh, you know? What, that Leah has a girlfriend? Yeah, I do. But is... What is it? Is something wrong with her? Well, she's bad news, Ms. Lewisson. Part of a bad crowd. Like what? Bob, is my daughter in danger? Yeah, yeah. I'm in the play with a few of her friends. They seem like they're in some really sketchy stuff. Sketchy? Like what? I mean, they must be into drugs or something. She's really scaring me. My God. Okay, Bob, thank you very much for telling me. I have to go. Okay. - Leah. Leah! Yeah? What the hell is going on? What are you talking about? Are you okay? No, I'm not okay. You need to get away from Pearl, now. Leah, this isn't right. What's not right? That I care about her? I know what is going on. I know that she's bringing you into this whole new world of trouble. Mom, you don't know crap. Can you just stay out of my business? You are my business. And I won't have you pulled into some crazy shit! Okay, Mom. Go screw yourself. I don't even know why I tried to tell you about any of this in the first place. Leah... Come on. Hello? Hello. Uh, Professor Cardin? Yes, this is he. Hi, my name is Julie Lewisson. And, uh, I'm actually calling regarding one of your students. Okay. I know this might sound weird, but I... I just recently saw her work and I was actually hoping to buy some of her photography. Oh, that's great. Yeah. It's beautiful. Um... Pearl Thompson. Uh, I don't have any student by that name. Could she be listed under a different name? Um... No, I'm... I'm... I'm sure she's a student there. She practically lives in the lab. No, I'm sorry. She's not a student here. Are you sure? I'm absolutely sure. Is there anything else I can help you with? No, I'm... I guess it was just my mistake. Okay, uh... Thank you for your time, Professor. Oh, no problem. Goodnight. Goodnight.

Don't let us down. What do you think? You look perfect. If you say so. You're the photographer. Come on. Are you okay? Leah, I haven't been completely honest with you about myself. Just... I... I can't. Just tell me. You're not gonna believe me. You're gonna think I'm crazy. Tell me. I am a Nightwalker. What does that mean? I live off of blood. I kill people for that blood.
