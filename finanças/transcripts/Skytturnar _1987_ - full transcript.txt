It's coming up. Hard astern. Hard astern. There it comes. Alright fire! Shit! That's it for today. Yes. Last day then. That's a relief. Got something in mind then? Yes. What? Reading. No, I mean now this is over. You got something else to do? Gotta do something. The question is what? That's exactly what I was wondering. We're turning out a right couple of philosophers, aren't we? Grímur. Phone. Grímur Úlfsson speaking. Grímur Úlfsson. Call from Reykjavík. Grímur, is that you? Yes, hello! Grímur. Hows it going? Going? Yes, it's going along alright. Look, there's something I have to tell you right away. Kelly's back. I mean, I think it's best. Him moving back. We're giving it another go. You see, he's promised me he's going to stop drinking. So you don,t have to come back here again. Grímur, can you hear me? Grímur? Hello? Here, I don't think we need to broadcast this to the whole fleet. Turn the bloody thing down a bit. Ebba. We took all your stuff round to your gran's place. She got herself all excited. Not my fault. She was in a real mood. I left your stuff there. Your running gear and your little statues and your photos and all that. We didn't think it would be a good idea for you to come here and pick them up. I think it's best for everyone like this. I km-now it is. Grímur? You better not go on deck with your ears sticking out like that. The wing might carry you off. Going to get yourself a job then? You don't think I'm going to work the lotteries for a living? Work? The lotteries! Can we get a job in the lotteries then? There's no point in getting angry at me. Yeah. Sorry mate. Where you going? Just going up to watch the video. What's on? "Naughty Nurses". Jesus Christ! I'm not going to watch that for the twentieth time. Don't you ever get tired of looking at that thing? There is nothing in it except naked girls working in some bakery or something in Copenhagen. Bakery in Copenhagen? I'm reading an article about shark fishing in Florida. So? They found an old treasure chest full of gold coins. Yeh, in Florida. Here in Iceland they've been looking for one treasure ship for twenty years, and they haven't so much as found a single bloody deck nail. Christ it'd be fun going to Florida. We might find some treasure like those shark fishermen. Well, it'd be fun for the sharks at least getting a nice Christmas roast like you to keep them happy in the water. I thought we decided you'd throw that suit away after you didn't make out in it last time. Give it one more try this weekend. If it doesn't get me a lay, I'll wear it for work all next year. If that's your plan to do, get yourself a job in a bank. Are you thinking about working in a bank? No way. The likes of us wouldn't get work in a bank. Bank robbers maybe. What are we going to do then? Well, if were lucky we might get a shoveling shit. And if that don't work out, well have to eat shit. What are you hanging down here for? You coming then? Just getting something. What the hell is this? Started playing with dolls have you? No it's a lucky troll Mum gave me. Now what does a great strapping of like you need with one of those? That's why I'm so lucky at cards and love. Oh? I thought it was because you looked so much like Robert Redford. You could probably use that for your passport photo. This ain't the first time I've watched this shit. Really? My old Dad, couldn't think of anything he liked more than to stand up here and watch this fucking mess. We must have driven out here every Sunday when I was a kid. Other people took their kids off to the park or the country. It bored me sick. Poor old Mum, she couldn't stand the smell so she stayed in the car. I stood up here with my old man and tried to scrounge enough money out of him to buy myself an ice cream. But he never listened. He just stood there and watched. What a load of crap! Hello Nonni. Hello there. How are you doing? Fine thanks. Got a nice bit for me then? Sure. I got a bag here. Could you put it in for me. There you go, that's really a good chunk you got there. Prime meat. It's for my old Gran. Thanks very much. Let me know if I can return the favour. Well, I can't think what that might be. We could help out if anyone had a go at you. Went for you, like. Couldn't we Búbbi? Yes. Be seeing you. Thanks very much. Bye. Well, Grímur, what can I do for you? What else can you besides paying me, then? Not that there's much point in giving guys like you money? You only spend it all on booze right away. Just sign here. You can just put a cross on yours Búbbi. No one asked you to interfere in my affairs. Oh, really? That's not what your grandma told me. She's phoned here every single day. All nonsense and worry. Either she's going completely mad or you're trying to do her in. What a fuck are you talking about? You bastard! Calm down! Grímur, Grímur. Don't you talk about my grandmother like that in front of me! You hear me! I'll have that one there with the picture of the waterfall on it. Here you are. How much is it? 850.- krónur. Come on, let's get going. What am I supposed to do with all this? Stick it in your pockets. I've always been more than willing to give people a lift, but I expect them to show modicum of manners. I picked up some kids last bank holiday. Stood there dripping wet in the rain. I mean, one would have thought they'd at least have shown a bit of gratitude. I got nothing but arrogance and lip. And then I finally managed to get rid of them, the car was a complete bloody mess. It's been foreign tourists usually. Give them your little finger, they'll have your whole arm... Why do you stop for them then? Up to now I've always believed Icelanders were better, but everything's going down the bloody drain in this country. No respect for anything anymore. Everyone is on the take. Individuals, pressure groups. It's all going to end in one huge bloody mess. What a lot of crap! Give us a break. Turn the radio on and relax. Now look here, friend. I'm in charge here and if I... Shut it will you. Right, out with you! Eat shit! Stupid old bastard! What do we do now? What do you mean? When we get to town? Yes. I haven't got a fucking clue. If you're not slaving your guts out at sea, You only end up in some shit factory when you get to land. You got any skills? Did a bit of gardening once... Gardening? Wasn't any fun either. I thought it might be because I used to go stay in the country when I was a kid. Perhaps I should try and get a job on a farm? Yeah, that would be terrific. You'd make a great cowboy. The cows would take one look at you and rush off home in fright. There's other things to do than rounding up cattle. Yeah, perhaps we should try and get a job. Maybe we ought to try to get a job together. Much better working with people you know. Yeah, great idea! We could work together as bog attendants at the lavs in the centre of town. You could take the Mens and I'll look after the Ladies on the other side of the road. Then I could pop over to you when I need rubber. But I thought you and me were going all the way to Florida? That would be fun. Wouldn't it just! That would be great. Can you give us a lift? Been driving long? Come from up north, eh? It'll have to be put out of its misery. Its leg is broken. It's in pain. It's going to have to be shot. Can't just let it lie here like this. What can we do? You can't do anything. There's a rifle behind the seat. Come on mate. It was a mercy killing, or whatever they call it. You've got blood on your hands. I'd always meant to get myself a horse too. Where do you want to get out? Well, we didn't have anywhere special in mind. I just thought you might live somewhere. Oh, I see what you mean. No problem. You just let us out when you stop yourself. Look at that poor sod. Can't even get to sit down. He's been thrown out everywhere. Maybe we should pop in there. I don't know about that. We might run into trouble. Us? Grímur! Grímur! Hello Silli, my old mate. Great to see you! I don't suppose you've got a drop? This stuffs too good for you. We can drink anything. Aren't you going to sit with us? No thanks Silli, we haven't got time. Look after yourself. You've always been so classy and flash. Couldn't you spare...? There you go. Thanks very much mate. Be seeing you. Enjoy yourselves. Battle cry. Battle cry. Battle cry on sale here. What's all that about? Battle cry. What's that? A battle cry. Come on, let's get ourselves in somewhere. What ungodly fear, even such shall befall them. Here, you're not coming in with that disgusting thing. What? This? Do us a favour and look after it for me. What the hell is this? Just come from the slaughterhouse have you? What's the matter? Something up? Oh, it's just that horse back there. It was horrible - all that blood. Come on, mate. I thought you said you'd spent time on a farm? Now I didn't think farm hands got worried about a little bit of blood. I was on a farm once. They used to shoot stray cats regularly and keep a tally by counting the bags they put them in. "Well, we haven't shot very many this time." "We had four bags last year." Sometimes they weren't even dead before they put them in the bags. Stop it... It was just cats. Even got one of the family cats sometimes. It didn't make any difference. Just one more for the bag. Look Grímur, I can't stand any more of this. Oh no? How many fish do you think you've killed in your time? Poor little fish, leaving their mummies and daddies behind. Let's forget about the horse or I'll loose my appetite. Okay, order something for us then. I'll have a rare steak. Reckon we know anyone here? No. It must be about ten to fifteen years since I came to a place like this in town and met someone I knew. Occasionally I've recognized a face, but then the face didn't recognize me. Really cosy here. Nearly as cosy as the forecastle on Gardar. What boat was that? An old line-fisher from Patreksfjord. Did a whole year on it. It was the other way round there. Everyone knew each other. Especially in the forecastle. I could go all around the coast, from one forecastle to another through the bilge water and among the smelly socks and I'd always find someone I knew. Not on shore. Don't know a soul. One - nill. Will someone get rid of this man. Here, you're not going to push me off my chair! Get your filthy hands off me, you rude bastard! Will you please throw him out of here! I was just tying my shoelaces! Alright mate, I think you've had enough for one night. Grímur! leave him alone, you bastards! Oh, leave me alone! Don't be like that, what's the matter? Why the hell do you carry on like that until we make bloody fools of ourselves! How many times have I told you..? I was only.. Will you shut up while I'm talking! From now on you're going to shut up and let me decide what to do, where we go, and who we talk to. Got it? Yes. Alright, let's get moving then. Got off without paying though, didn't we? No we didn't. I'd already took care of that. I'll pay! How much is it? 250.- kronur. Must be enough. What a bloody mess! Ought to a special fare for scum like that. I'm not buying anything. What's all this about? Don't you recognize me? Grímur. Hello Grandma! What's this? It's whale meat, Grandma! Dear, dear. I'll probably have to get myself some new teeth. We're you trying to get a hold of me up on the Whaler, Grandma? There's something wrong with the telly. I kept getting a double image. Want me to deal with the ghosts for you then, Gran? Then she kept calling, that girlfriend of yours. Got all her wits about her has she? Turns up here with all your things. Even broken plates, and dumps the whole lot on the floor here. Aren't you going to make us some coffee, woman? Really irritates me. This is Búbbi. Búbbi! Now what kind of name do you call that? Maybe he could have a look at the telly for me? Shall I make you cook this meat for the two of you? We just finished eating thanks. Yes, and then she just turns up here out of the blue that girlfriend of yours and the little madam pours out a stream of abuse at me. The stink of that booze! Been at the poison again have you?! It seems to me everyones done their best to be good to you... Grandma! And that's the thanks they get. You're not getting any booze here. Grandma. Don't give that "Grandma" business. I bet your father, rest his soul, would be pleased if he could see you now. Him a gentleman all his life. Grandma, you're always going on at me for not visiting you, and then when I do turn up... The stink of that booze! Can't you turn up just once without dragging one of your drinking partners with you? Show a bit of decency. Your father, rest his soul... Just leave, both of you, before you break anything else for me. I don't want drunkards in my house! Perhaps I should have given the old dear the chocolates, but I was keeping them for Ebba's kids. Well, if it isn't Grímur! Rare birds, these white ravens! Ravens? Looks more like a white whale he's got there with him! Who's going to take the champ then? Isn't that Moby Dick himself you've got with you? This Greenpeace business got you bringing them in alive then? Call me Ishmael! We could get a fortune for this one if we sold it to the Japs for hamburger meat and dog food. I've heard they'll pay anything for the foreskins. Really? Yes, they use the foreskins to make the very best leather sofas. Why don't we just cut the expensive part off then. It's a very simple operation. That was a canon in the corner pocket. Know what that is Moby Dick? Grímur, I'm leaving. "Grímur, I'm leaving." Hold on. What's the hells the matter? Where's the man gone? You mean the whale? He spread out his fins and left. I don't believe. The bastard! What are you rushing off for? Just felt like it. Waiting for a bus then? No. Not against the law to sit here, is it? Pissed off about something? No. I'm not pissed off. But people can get hurt you know. Come on! We're mates aren't we? Yes. Aren't we? Yes. You're not leaving now? Where you going to go anyway? I don't know. Look, there's a cab. Why don't you come along? I've just got to pop in and talk to Ebba. Yeh, alright. You only have to wink and you'll have her eating out of your hand. I don't know about that. No, I mean it. Especially with those Chocolates for the children and all that. What are you doing here? Can't I come in? I'm busy! Ebba! Out! You'll frighten the children! What's going on? What are you playing at? Alright, outside! I'll call the police! What the hell are you doing here! Out with you! And take that with you! Let's just head for a dance hall and find ourselves a couple of nice birds. Here, you have this. You want some? How do you do. Guðbjartur Hafsteinsson from Hellissandur. Guðbjartur Hafsteinsson from Hellissandur. And what's your name then, beauty? Leave it out for once. Come on, this isn't our kind of place. Might I offer the young lady a drink? Same again. Hey, Búbbi. My friend, Guðbjartur Hafsteinsson from Hellissandur. Hi. What can I get you? A very large Dubonnet. Very large Dubonnet for the lady-double Genever and Sprite for me! What's your name, beauty? My friends call me Thura. I'm Grímur Úlfsson, seaman. I can't stand seamen. Oh really?! Who's supposed to bring in all the fish then? Come on, leave it out. I can't stand them either. You can buy me another drink, but please don't talk too much. Well, fancy that. My favourite album. Can I put it on? "I can't do a thing, won't answer the door till my baby comes back to me." Till my baby comes back to me. Can't we get some sleep in the middle of the night without having to listen to a bunch of drunkards! Look who's talking about drunkards! Who puked up all over the lobby! Who have you got in there? None of your business who I've got in there. Stupid prick! Turn it down,will you! You've tried often enough yourself to barge your way in here in the middle of the night. Stinking of shit! I'm calling the police! You do and I'll call your wife! Someone trying to barge their way in? Mind your own! I'm not having two stupid men taking over my flat. You can get out too! Now, there's no point in getting excited. Leave me alone! I was only trying to get some money that dropped into the seat. Get your hands off me! Rude bastard! You're all the bloody same, you men! Get the hell out of here. You make me sick, all of you! Do you hear! Get the hell... Good evening. What's the problem here then? Get these men out. No one invited them here. Look at you. You're pathetic! Do I have to wait until you start crying? I've got plenty of time, don't worry. What the hell were you doing there in that flat? Making a bloody row? That woman invited us. Take this fat off outside! Get him out of here. What the hell is going on? Are you going to keep us in here? You can go. Go? Here, what the hell is this? What did you drag us in here for? I mean, if you make a big fuzz arresting someone in the middle of the night, the least you could do is find him somewhere to stay! What is this! We didn't do anything. Aren't you coming? Quickly then. You scared? Me? No. Maybe we should have tried to get a job on one of the coastguard boats? On what? -Coastguard. I've tried that game. I was on one of them once for a couple of weeks. We spent the whole time scrubbing the officers bog with a toothbrush. It's like a fucking war here. I think were going to have to call in the Special Brigade. What a mess! What are you doing here? I'm supposed to do the cleaning. Cleaning? Turn that bloody thing off!. Well, excuse me! I suppose I'm allowed to make coffee? How many of them in there? One, maybe two. And then some woman. Woman? Yes, some woman went in there just before. The cleaning lady probably. Bloody idiots! You've made a balls of this! I think you'd better leave, dear. They've got soldiers out there. It's got completely out of hand. You don't say. I'm serious. Let's get out of here. Grímur. And now what? Say were finished playing cops and robbers? Grímur, let's go! How can you be so stupid! It's not dear old Mum anymore. If we go out there well get shot down like Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. These men are obviously highly dangerous. We are going to have to smoke them out. Be prepared if they come out armed. Radio Reykjavík. The time is 6:50. Bishop Jón Ragnarsson with the morning sermon. "Each morning we awaken with new hope. Whatever yesterday may have been like, at night we have new hopes for the future. Each day we learn something, and not only of the struggle for existence. Many days give us optimism and a basis for new hope. Many days give us pleasure and things to look forward to, and God wants us to believe in the hope he gives us, He does not want us to lose sight of Him and His promise with which He helps us along the path of life. Sometimes hope is all we have, small as it might be. A hope based on faith in God will never let us down, because Jesus Christ promised us salvation."
