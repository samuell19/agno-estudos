Okay. Okay, okay. - Hey! - Hey! Mama? - Mama? - Yes? - Well, can you... can you order? - No, we did, we did. No, she told me that she's, like, gonna take this little clay and put it in another thing and... I can't understand shit. Yes, I put some salt. Let's put it all if... if it's gonna last... Hey, when I... when I speak to you in Italian, help me! Please don't answer in English, huh? - Okay. - Okay. - All right. - Is it done? Yeah, no. Okay? - Two minutes and we eat. - Okay. Mama, look! They are the only two inhabitants. All that is heard is the sound of their breath. Mother asleep by bar, covered up and warm, but now appears... appears far away. Clint kneels before the girl. Pupa, you hungry? Hungry? Yeah? Nikki, do you want a lot? Are you hungry? This. Put it. - Want some oil? - No, grazie. So we're ready. - Yo. - Hey. - Did she go down? - Yes. - Easy? - Finally. - Is she asleep? - Finally asleep. I'm reading this thing, I don't know... What is it about? No, it's, um, you know, it's the section with, uh, you know, the thing that you... the feeling is they traverse the galaxy and now on the other side, they're... it's only two inhabitants. All that is heard is the sound of their breath. Mother asleep by bar, covered up and warm, but now appears. Clint kneels before Russian girl. That part. I just don't know whether it's, um... too sentimental, or... And also, I... - No, it seems so sweet. - I don't know... - You like it? - Yes. I think it's very... It's like a dream, it's like... ...something, you know, out of this world. At least, you know, you have a purpose to... No, I think... I don't know. There's something wrong about it, I don't know. I had something else I wanted to... How are you? I'm tired. - Yeah? - I'm tired. I'm tired, you know, she's really... - She seems good, though, huh? - She's good, but she's... You know, it's not like you just stay with her. - I know. - You really gotta be very... all your focus is only the baby, the baby, the baby. - I know, I know, I know. - You forgot about... I know it better than anyone. - Yes. - I think, you know, it's normal with a baby, but, you know, you just gotta... Unless you aren't happy with me anymore. You don't even know. - Sometimes. - I know, I know. - Sometimes. - Wrong question. Sometimes I am... You know, sometimes you just don't talk with me, you don't communicate with me, you don't... - I know. - You know... - We get busy. - You're so busy, and you forget about that I'm a woman and I'm different. Okay, well, what should I know? Hmm? Yeah. You forget I'm a man, huh? This is what I'm talking about. I forget you're a man also because I have this little... baby. I know. Us. She's asleep now. Not here. Touch. It's so nice. Oh, such a beautiful ass. Oh, baby. Mama. - Mama. - Wait. - The baby. - What? The baby. Yes. - Wait a second. - Mama, Mama. Oh! It's okay? Okay, sorry, I walked too fast. Okay. More? DeeDee. So fancy. What do you think? DeeDee. Ahh! - Ciao. - What's happening? Oh my God, you look so good! Where have you been, what you did? - Gelato. - Gelato, fragola? Fragola. - Okay. - Okay. Lisa... Lisa cried? Lisa cried? Why Lisa cried? Oh my God. It's okay. We're gonna come back. Yes, we're gonna still play with her. I gotta do something real quick, okay? Yes. Let's wash our hands. Exterior: snow country, day. Credits over wild winter landscape. When I had been pondering many things to myself for a long time and had for many days been seeking my own self and what my own good was and what evil was to be avoided, it suddenly spoke to me. What was it? I, myself, or someone else, inside or outside me. This is the very thing I would love to know but don't. Sexy, beautiful, stupid. I want to say, the idea is, these are all simple games, but I like very much the idea of distraction, the double... the double focus that you have, because you're all... for me, performing is always between control and abandon. Okay. Um, so when we do some of these distracting things, things that don't seem to go together, it makes you feel off-balance, but if you can relax in that state, it makes you more emotionally available. Your job is to approach that... that action that you know with a way that's not to show but to do, to do the action, do the action in a pure way, so the action is born, and when the action is born, you have a reaction to it, and that propels you to something. But it's sometimes imitated emotion or demonstrated emotion, not really felt emotion or experience. If you're only doing emotional things that you feel safe with, it's... it's for you. It's... you gotta go beyond yourself. - Okay. - We all know it in life. When we do things and we forget about ourselves and we're just doing the action in a pure way, that's when we get closer to experiencing, for me, the beauty of life. So I'm making this movie in Miami and I'm... I'm deep into using crack cocaine. I'm drinking, heroin. I'm out, I'm out. Hey! Good to see you. - Yeah, I'm good. - Good to see you. It's hot, but... Look at that fucking water. Like a beer. I'll see you down there in a minute. Yeah. You know, and we're making this movie in Miami at a time that Miami is, like, the nightlife is exploding, and just made a movie... I don't have my regular people with me. I gotta make a movie that's gonna be the first video... movie shot with a video camera. I'm feeling really like it's... I'm it, you know, I'm... my ego is like, "I'm gonna do this thing," and not only... I'm gonna make a remake of La Dolce Vita. American remake, and I got this young Cuban actor and, uh, he's, uh, he's down with it and he's also... when I get there, you know, the guy's in rehab, but I'm good with that, and I just gotta get him out of rehab, and I do. I get him out of rehab. I remember I even, you know, bringing him stuff when he wasn't in rehab. He'd meet us outside... outside the place, like middle of the night, it was crazy. But I needed this kid. And, uh, one day, I'm... I'm working on the set and I see this extra, this chick, she's good looking. You know, I shouldn't be messing with her, but I'm... I'm it, I'm having... I can do whatever I want, right? I'm feeling strong and I'm prancing. So I go out with her, we're out late, and I go to my friend's place that's got an all-night... it's like a diner, but it's a hip place, you know, it's like a cool, fancy place. I get in there, I lay some... a hundred dollar bill on the bar and I say, "Hey, buy these guys a drink." I go in, go out with the owner of the place to do some stuff, and when I come back, the chick's not there. Uh, you know, she's gone, and the guy says, "Hey, who's gonna pay for the drinks?" I said, "I left a hundred." He said, "No, no, I didn't see any hundred." So I'm really pissed, I get on the phone, and I get her number and I say, "You fucking bitch!" You know, really chew her out nasty, like mean, like crazy, like, you know, she betrayed this... this guy that was happening, you know. What I didn't know is this girl had a boyfriend, and her boyfriend was crazy about what she was doing with these movie people, and he was crazy jealous. She talked about, you know, being afraid of this guy. Well, I go back to my South Beach motel, I forgot to double lock the door, and I think I'm dreaming, I go to bed and I think I'm dreaming that some guy's beating the shit out of me. Wailing away on me, just slamming me in the face. But I'm not dreaming. This guy came in, he's the boyfriend, he's fucking, you know, cursing me out about what I did to the girl, and he's beating me really bad. My face is all blown up, I mean, like this. The guy leaves, they grab me, bring me to the hospital, you know, nobody's there, I'm all alone, you know, and I'm messed up, and my ego is so crazy that I also think that they want to kill me, you know, I get these paranoid thoughts of... All I can think about is being safe. So, I... I hear that there's a rehab place in this hospital on the third floor, and it's kind of a lockdown, like, only family can come, so I go into rehab. But I have no intention of getting sober. None at all, I mean, this... all this shit happens. I almost die, you know. Still, I don't get the idea that, you know, what I'm doing is a problem. I'm still bigger than that, I'm still more important than that. It still isn't occurring to me. It fucking... it's hard to believe. I mean, this is 12 years before. So... You know, I go in this place, and I'm still using, and my dealer's coming. You know, my face starts to heal, and I'm feeling like I can do it again, so it's just, you know, amazing that it took me so long. I mean, yesterday was my birthday. It's been six years. And, you know, I want to thank everybody. Also, something magical happened, or at least for me it was magical, that last month, um, a guy came, he was a tourist from the States, and he came to the meeting, he came here, and afterwards, we were outside and he came up to me, and he said, you know, "I was... I was your doctor, I was your counselor in rehab in Miami, and, uh, I followed... I followed, uh... I followed your movies and I followed you, and I... I just want to say that, um, I'm happy to see you alive." And I said, "Thank you," and that was really beautiful. And thank you all. Okay, so the time's beaten us once again. Folks, we'll finish with the Serenity Prayer. - God... - God... grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference. Keep coming back, it works if you work it, so work it, you're worth it. Well done, man. Good job. Congratulations. Keep coming back. - Happy birthday, thanks. - Happy birthday. Hey. Hey. You're never gonna fall. Okay, we're here, we're here. Okay, okay. Goodnight, moon! Goodnight, we go to sleep! Okay. So you've been making speeches to the crowd in the piazza. I only told some people that the temple of old laws must fall and a new temple of truth should be built. But don't take me literally. I'm just trying to make myself understood. Why is someone like you upsetting the people? Why? You think you know the truth? What is truth? The truth is, you're in pain. You have a terrible headache and you're thinking of suicide. You can barely look at me. The way you look at me disturbs me. I don't want to be a torturer. But this feeling will go away. It will. It's going away. This feeling... ...it's going away. It is, it's going away. It's going away. You should go take a walk in the park. Totally up to you. I could come with you. You seem like an intelligent man. The trouble with you is your mind is closed. You lack empathy. You only care for your dog. Tell me, are you a doctor? No, I'm not a doctor. Because you made a gesture as if to stroke something, and your lips... You are a doctor. No. I'm not a doctor. Ah, okay. You think it's too heavy for you? No, Mama is gonna carry it. It's too heavy for you to take, I know. Okay, now... Tommaso? - Yeah? - We are about to leave. - You're going? - Yup. - Okay. - We're going to Nonna's. You sure you don't want to come? You sure you don't want to come with us? No, I got... I got too much to do. - You know. - Come on, you... Let me call you a cab, okay? Did you call a cab? Oh, no, no, no, I'm gonna go with the metro. No, no, no, it's too far. It's too far. Let me call. - No, no, listen... - No, it's too far for the baby, and that's a freaky neighborhood. I'm gonna take the metro and I'm... - I'm calling a taxi. - No, please don't call it. Please. No, please. - No. - No, it's okay. No, I'm gonna take the metro. - Are you kidding me? - Grazie. No, it's gonna... it's gonna come in just a little... - Give me some money, please. - Oh, okay, yeah. But I'm not gonna take the cab. I wanna take the metro. It's cool. I'm really cool with that. - It's coming. - No, really. - I'm calling you a taxi. - Tommaso, don't do this to me. I'm really good with it. Wow, okay. Okay. No... Inhale in. Bring it down to that point of meeting down here. Switch, the other nostril, then bring the energy up. And then send it up through the crown of your head with your diaphragm. - Okay, we'll breathe together. - Mm-hmm. Hold. Okay. Nikki? Tommaso. - Yo. - Nikki, what... What? Why are you calling? I, you know, I've been calling you and you didn't pick up, what the fuck? I mean, come on. - What, what? - I've been trying to reach you, I've probably called you 50 times. I just forgot the charger of my phone, are you serious? Either you don't pick up or it goes to voice mail. What the fuck? I mean, I worry. What if something happened to the baby? - It's not funny. - Well, you don't have to worry. You know, don't act like a fucking kid, you know? You got some responsibilities. I worry about, you know, I worry... So please, don't... don't do that again, okay? Everything is fine, don't worry. - I just forgot the charger. - Okay, pick up next time. - Okay, okay. - Okay. - Ciao, ciao. - Ciao. Okay. Lately, uh, with the mother of my baby girl, DeeDee, uh, I've had some problems because every time I try to extend myself to her, do things for her, she really pushes me away. She's, like, got issues. She... she's younger than me, she's, uh, 29. You'd think she would appreciate my experience. But, you know, sometimes, she... she just says, "Oh, let me make my own decision up. I don't know who I am if I don't make a decision." And I'm telling you, this goes down to just very simple things, you know, like what food to eat or whether to take a taxi or the subway, or these kinds of things, and it... it really robs me of, um, feeling good like I'm taking care of her. I do know, you know, she has a strange relationship... well, a rough relationship with her father because he was an alcoholic and a bad Russian drunk. Vodka, you know, he was abusive with the mother. Eventually, she kicked her out and he left when she was only four years old. And then, uh, things started to change in the Eastern Bloc, and her mother and then her sister went to Moscow and she got passed around with family and... and other people. Um, that's where she lived. So she grew up very independent. So she did learn to be self-reliant, but at the same time, she had these unresolved issues with her father because she also romanticizes him. She still wants to talk to him, but he won't talk to her. He still is around somewhere, he's still an alcoholic. You know. So that's a little hard to take. You know, I'm haunted a little bit by the fact that... my... my DeeDee is three years old, and when... when I wasn't sober, I had two adopted children, and I was not... I left when, uh... I basically left, I wasn't there because I wasn't sober, when my youngest was four years old, and I think she, you know, it really destroyed her, and I don't want that to happen again. I'm sober now, and, uh, I'm so afraid of it, but I don't know how to do because I try to take care, and every time I do, you know, it's like there's no recognition that, um, that... Even like the idea that the baby needs a father is like an oppressive or, you know... She doesn't think that's necessarily true, and for me, it's essential because it breaks my heart. I remember the four-year-old, right before I left, she said to me, uh, "Are you leaving because I make too much noise?" And the truth is, she was the quietest, sweetest girl in the world, so that... that always stays with me, and I just don't want that to happen again, and I'm... I'm happy about a lot of things. I'm happy that I'm sober, but, uh, this is something that I'm dealing with right now. - Thanks, Tommy. - Thanks, Tommy. Yeah, I'm Diedre, an addict. - Hi, Diedre. - Hi, Diedre. Uh, related a lot to what I just heard. I feel like being in a partnership and parenting in a partnership can be so challenging for me. Um, I mean, it says in our literature, it is, like, impossible for us to form a true partnership with another human being. I mean, that says it all. Um... Because, like, I've, you know... Like, we don't have relationships, we take hostages, right? So like... Like, we're either, like, dominating or we're completely underneath. Like, there's not the, just, the equality, you know, and I... I always... I always know my partner's inventory better than he does. Like, I always know exactly what's wrong with him, what he's gotta do, his past, his psychology, everything, you know what I mean, and the thing is is that this program teaches me to, like, stick to my side of the street. I have to look at what my part is, what I do, and, you know, as soon as I'm pointing a finger, like, it's... I've gotta look at myself. So, anyway, I'm super grateful. I pass. Thanks, Diedre. All the best. Take it easy, guys. Okay, guys, I'm off, I'm really hungry. I have to get something to eat, so I'll see you later. All right, all the best. Ciao. Take it easy. - Bye. - All the best. Ciao. Ciao. I'm giving you two. Yeah, I should probably get going too. Okay, yeah, all right. - Love you. - Goodnight. - Okay, love you, sweetie. - Bye. - Great to see you. - Yeah, same. - We'll talk later. - Okay. - Bye. - Ciao. Hmm, all right, I'm... Yeah, I walk that way. Oh. So... Are you around for a while? Yeah, I'm here for the summer. You are, you're not going anywhere? - No. - Yeah? No, I usually like to travel when it's not so crowded. - Smart idea. - Yeah. I don't get this Italian thing of everybody leaving at... Yeah, exactly, and being, like, all packed on the beach. I get it, but... - I don't get it. - ...what a drag. I mean, I get how it happens. Right, right, right, yeah, yeah. School holidays, whatever. No, I have the luxury of traveling off-season, so I usually take advantage of that. Do you usually go by yourself? Um, it depends, actually... - With friends? - No, I usually go by myself. You were with that guy for a little while. - Are you still with him? - Mmm... No, no? Um... no. No, that's finished. How long ago was that? Well, it was on and off for like six years, but finally finished like about a year and a half ago. I'll... I'll walk you. Okay. - Okay? - Yeah. Thanks. How long ago? - About a year and a half ago. - Oh, okay. And how has that been, like, being alone again? Good? Hmm, yes. - Do you like being alone? - Actually, yes. Yeah? At first it was, you know... Well, at first I was just bummed out because we tried on and off for so long, but now I'm pretty happily single, you know. In fact, I was just talking to a friend of mine about how much I love sleeping alone. It's like heaven. - A whole bed to myself. - Oh, God! Not me, I think I've always been with someone. - Oh, really? - Yeah, yeah. But, I don't know, I never had the opportunity to sleep alone, I think, so this is my... my first big run of... - Enjoying yourself. - ...hogging the bed. You just need a big bed so you have some choices. You know. - Right? - Uh, yeah. That's what I like. I like a nice, big bed. We're gonna need a bigger bed, it's like... Hmm. - Well... - Okay, um... - This is me. - Yeah, I know, I know. Okay, well, have a good night, huh? Thank you. You too. Thanks for walking me home, and, um, happy six years. - Thank you. - That's awesome. - Thank you. - Yeah, okay. Okay. - Make sure you get in. - Thank you. - Okay, yeah, goodnight. - Goodnight. - Sleep well. - You too. Thanks. Oh! Hey! Hey! Hey! - How are you? - Hey. Good? Yeah? Was it fun? Yeah, it's... it's fun. I missed you guys. - Okay? - Yes. We had a great time. - Umbrella? - Yeah, take the umbrella. Take the other shoe. Okay, honey. Okay. But it was good? You know, it's always good, you know. She has this big garden, big things, and she plays with it, and it's really nice. I missed you, huh? Really? Yeah. - Really? - Yeah, yeah! Well, I don't believe it. - You don't? - No. - Okay. - You look too good to miss me. Okay? So, what's going on here? I've just been working. I've just been working, you know? I'm trying to do this crazy thing about these, um, scenes with the bear. And? I don't know, 'cause you don't want it to be, like, you know, like a big special effects thing, but I want the scariness of the bear in there, so... Clint puts down bar rag and comes around bar to get a closer look. Numbers stop, and again, it's a loss. Woodsman turns to Clint, only this time, it is the head of a bear in the clothes of the woodsman. Clint, with no Mitchell in sight, is in bloody, violent, and extended fight for his life. Dogs outside going wild. - You're eating? - Yes. Why didn't you call me? I thought... I thought you already ate. No. - No? - No. - Why? - Why didn't you call me? But why you didn't eat yet? You know, it's fucking... it's thoughtless. Come on, I waited... you know, I... I missed... I sat around all yesterday, and I made my own dinner, then you make food, you don't even call me. I've been waiting to have lunch. Why you... why you gotta wait for me? Why you gotta wait for me? You can cook, you are an adult. I know, okay, okay, I can cook and I will cook. I'll cook my own stuff. Jesus Christ, do you know, I waited for you. - You know, I wait for you... - No, no, come on... No, it just bugs me because it's inconsiderate. I like to eat with you and the baby. Oh, come on. What do you mean, "Oh, come on"? What do you mean? Yeah, laugh, you know, you laugh when you know you're full of shit. - That's what happens. - Can I have at least the freedom to eat when I want and with who I want and without busting my balls and blah-blah-blah? Okay, I don't mean to bust your balls, believe me. I just try to take care, it's all a little silly, you know? You talk a lot of shit, you know, you talk a lot of... ...hippie shit. - Oh my God. - Why don't you make it for me? I mean, I'm trying to work. - Really? - I make it for you. It's just... it's just common consideration. Really, I thought you already had. Being a family, being a couple, you know, loving someone is being present. It's about... it's about attention, it's about... it's about, you know, taking care. I'm trying to do my thing. - And... - What is your thing? - My thing? - Yeah, what is your thing? "It's your thing, do what you wanna do, I can't tell you who to sock it to." Oh, come on. To do what I want, when I want, everything that I really want, without explaining to somebody... So I have two children now? Start your story. Okay? Don't worry. Mama? Mama, Mama? You know what, I'm gonna go down there. - Okay? - It's okay, it's okay. Everything gonna be okay. You know, he's freaking out the baby. I know, I know, I know, I know. Just... yeah, but just be careful. - Listen, be careful. - Yeah, yeah, I know. You know, with these guys, you never know. Yo! - ...motherfucker. - Get outta here! - You speak English? - I don't speak English but I... Get the fuck outta here, get the fuck outta here. Get outta here! Fucking bloody... Get your shit outta here, come on, go! - ...I'll destroy you. - Yeah, okay, okay, okay. Yeah, you're gonna do it? Get outta here, get outta here. Just get out. Beat it, beat it. Come on, be on your way. Take your food with you. Go. Oh, my baby, she can't sleep, you're scaring the shit out of her. Where is it? Your baby is sleeping? Upstairs, upstairs. So I'm making bothering with you? You're bothering me. - It's true? - Yeah, it's true, it's true. Keeping... - Yeah. - No anything. Okay. We maybe compromises. Okay, you can sit down, but no more, okay? Yeah. I don't want to bother you. Good. You're a nice person, give me some coins? Yeah, I can give you some coins. Where you come from? The States. Which part of States? New York. - New York. - How about you? All of my friends live in here, here, just near here. They came from New York. Where are you from? - Pakistan. - Pakistan? You know where it is? I've heard of it. They are all bullshit. I know, I know, I know. Okay, okay, okay. Fuckin' hell. That's... that stuff's poison, you know that. - Enjoy yourself. - Okay. - Have a good night. - Yes, to you. See you the next time. Okay, good luck. Okay. Okay. Goodnight. Just go. You're good. DeeDee! Okay. So where is he now? I don't know. You don't... but he just wrote you, right? He sent you an email. Yeah, he sent me some emails during those three years... Only... ahh, see, I thought he just sent you recently. - No. - No? Oh. No, like, a few emails in three years... - Oh, that's terrible. - ...are not enough for a father. So you're, you know, so you basically cut him off, you're angry because he... - Of course I am. - Yeah. He... he was everything for me. So he disappointed you. He... He was teaching me to believe in some values. Mm-hmm. And he showed me that those values don't exist. - Okay. - He destroyed my world. He destroyed my hope, everything. Right. So... How can it be possible, like, for a father? I don't know. I mean, we are... He made me. He's supposed to love me, to stay with me, to take care of me, but he doesn't. He's completely focused on other stupid stuff. Right. I don't... I don't know what to say. - Anyway... - I mean... yeah. Let's speak about something more. Okay, something else. What about your baby? She's good, I mean, you know, every day is a little miracle. She learns lots of stuff, she's talking a lot more. Um, you know, I love taking her to the park. I've got some stuff with her mother, but, um, you know about that. So, it's hard, you know? But I'm dealing with it, and, um, you know, making work and... I get to talk to you. Class was good, huh? Yeah, today was amazing. Yeah, I love having you in class. - Thanks. - No, it's nice, and I'm always happy to see you. Okay, so, maybe I should go. Yeah, what are you up to? I don't know. You gotta go? - Maybe, yeah. - Yeah, okay. Okay, all right, ciao. Okay, I gotta go. Okay. When you touch the fundamental nature of the ultimate reality of any phenomenon whatsoever, there is pleasure. Everything that exists is capable of eliciting pleasure in your mind, but you are narrow. Your mind has neurotic obsessions such as, "I only like things that are purple." For you, only purple things are beautiful. This sort of neurotic, dualistic, unrealistic way of thinking only gets you into trouble, but we do it all the time, don't we? Hey! What's happening? How come you came here? What's with this surprise? What is this surprise? Okay, so... Hey! Ciao! Hey, Lisa. Oh! Hey! Oh! They're having fun, they're playing. I've been all over the park running after them. My name's Danny, and I'm an alcoholic. - Hi, Danny. - Hi, Danny. I've enjoyed the meeting, you know, and I'm listening to the stories around the room and just thinking about, you know, often when I come here, I'm afraid, you know. The thing that's in my mind most is feeling sorry for myself because everybody else is going to the pub, and I have to fucking come here and listen to people talking and, you know, and I think about the way it was, like, going to the pub with a pint in the hand, cracking the jokes, and all the rest of it. So I come here and I'm feeling sorry for myself, but I'm quickly reminded of, you know, how good it is to be sober and, you know, I'm grateful because this week, as you all know, Noemi has been going through, you know, she has cancer, and, um, she did treatment already and things have been going really well, but, um, you know, we're going for a routine test this week, and unfortunately, the fucking thing's come back, you know, and it's not life-threatening, you know, by no means are we looking at death or anything like that, but when I come here and I'm feeling sorry for myself because I have to sit here and listen to people, and then I think about the reality that, you know, my future wife is facing, it brings in the sharp focus, the, you know, the selfish, self-centered nature of what it is that I suffer from, and it reminds me of how lucky I am to be here, you know. That's all I've got for this evening. Thanks very much. - Thanks, Danny. - Thanks, Danny. My name is Souten, I'm an alcoholic. - Hi, Souten. - Hi, Souten. When I was about 19 years old, I was already 13 years drinking and doing drugs. I rock bottom big time. I came in AA, somebody helped me, and I stayed in the program for eight years, and then it stopped, and I picked up one drink, and I was fucked again for another 18 years. Four years ago, I rock bottom a little different than the first time I rock bottom. I was in my house, and there were all people I don't know in my house. Everywhere were bottles with booze on the floors, and cocaine on the table, and women in my bed who I don't know. And the worst thing is that my wife, she was in the airplane coming from Amsterdam back home, and I kick everybody out of my house, I clean my house, and when I put the last bottle in the busta nero, in the trash bag, the taxi came up with my wife, and I run to the bathroom, and I had this mirror moment, I looked in the mirror after 18 years and I saw myself totally white with the red eyes. And I thought, "Fuck, man, that's not you, that's the devil," and there it hit me, the little... something told me in my ears, "You have to do something about your life, man." And I did. So I did a year full, every day a meeting. That was my first sober year, and it was a miracle. And then miracles started happening. - Hey! - Can you give me a lift? Yeah, come on. All right, I'll see ya later on then. Good luck, all the best, take it easy. I just want to be free, free from all the bullshit. I must... I must be careful. Yeah, okay. No, I'll walk you down. Oh, no, I'm coming with you. You're coming... Oh, you're coming. Watch your step. Okay. It's just, uh, becoming more and more a problem, you know, and I know it, uh, has to do with the baby sleeping with us, but I mean, uh... But the baby has its own bed, doesn't it? No, no. No, she fucking sleeps with us. So she's using the bed? Well, I mean, you know, ever since... ever since that baby was born, everything changed. You know, I don't know, we just don't, uh... Yeah, it changed like overnight. What I think is happening here, I think, is that she is living out a childhood experience. The scenes which are occurring now between you and her, I would think that they probably reflect what was happening in the house when she was a child, and she's provoking that. She has created this white... white knight in shining armor that she idolizes, but in a sense, you can't... you should not take away that figure because that figure, for the moment, is holding her together. The big problem is, I have such fucking rage about this 'cause I know I have no place to, uh... To discharge it. But that's the number one issue at the moment. Why does that tie up to the anger? Because the anger occupies so much space in your life. There's very little energy left for anything else, so if you create areas of interest for you, like empathy for people, you're involved in their lives. Energy flows there, so there is less energy for the anger. Look, we are like... when we come into AA, we're like lost souls, lost fucking souls. Your soul is either hanging off the fucking tree or it's over there, and you have to get it back, and by becoming human, but joining with the other gods, uh, slowly it got accommodated sort of in its own fucking time. And you have... you become your own self, and you give yourself your dignity, not she. That's... then the codependency ends there at that stage, you understand? Interior: cafe, nightfall. The two enter cafe and make their way to the bar. Clint moves behind bar and prepares them warm drinks, knowing already what they want. They speak to each other in Russian, and whether Clint knows the language, it is also hard to tell. After encouragement from the mother, the girl stands up and opens her clothes to reveal she is pregnant. Clint's eyes come alive. The feeling is as if they traversed the galaxy and now were its only two inhabitants. On the furs, they begin to make love, both breathing in rhythm as one. They come together. It sounds like music. Um, I'm tired. I'm... I'm gonna go to sleep. I'm sorry, I'm really sorry. Fuck. Fuck. Take this. It's all I have. Yo! Hey! Goddamn it, what are you... - Just stop it! - Where are you going? - Why don't you wait for me? - Listen, you stop. You know damn well I need you! I need you to go to the... What's wrong with you? Don't scream at her! - What? Stop what? - Don't touch me! What are you doing? We just go out... ...and you don't even help me with anything! Stop it! You're a big problem! I need you, I need you. Why... why did we go out? - To fix the lamp! - Oh my God. What do you? You run off. What the fuck? This is not about what you do, look at you! What? You're the problem! You're the fucking problem! Don't scream at her! Look at you, you look insane! You are the problem! That's my baby! Fuck. Fucking shit! Fucking bitch! What the... Shit! If you really check up deeper what you do, what you did, since you were born up to now, which is really worthwhile to bring the true happiness and the joyful life, what you did? You check up. You check up. Don't look others. You check up your own action. You have your body, your speech, your mind. These three. Okay, these three actions, what you did worthwhile? You check up that way. It's so simple. Look at me. Look at me! Look at me! Look at me! Oh my God! No! Pull. Pull! Stop it! Stop it! You make like you're insane! I got enough of you! I can't stand you! I don't love you, I'm sorry, I don't love you! Bada.
