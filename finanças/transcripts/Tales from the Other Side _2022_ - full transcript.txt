OK, OK, OK, but stay clear of weirdos and stick together. There's safety in numbers, and be home in an hour or mom will kill us both. OK. Come on let's go. Awesome tonight is going to be legendary. I'm going to eat everything in sight. Let's go there. Yeah. OK. Well, that's been poisoning. What are you talking about? We got so much candy. Yeah, but nothing scary happened. No pumpkin smashing or anything. I just wanted to do something amazing. Like what? Boy like that. No, way that's scary Mary's house. Whose scary Mary? She's the town's oldest secret. An old witch that never leaves her house. They said whoever came up to her doorstep she poisoned them, and boiled them into stew. And she ate them. So many people would go missing mostly kids like us, girl scouts, paper boys anyone who came knocking at her door. They said she's horribly mangled, and older than the town itself. The last people that I came up missing were one to two years before you and your family moved in. They said she's still there waiting for her next victim. Well, why didn't the police just arrest her? No, proof. No, bodies left to identify. Yeah, well, it is just a story. It's not like anyone who know has seen her. Then let's go. What? No. No, one would answer if it's just a story. What if it isn't just a story? Then maybe she has some good candy. I don't know. Come on. Imagine everyone's face at school when they hear we knock on scary Mary's door. We'll be legendary. Well? What? Why me? It's your idea you knock. Well, it looks like there's nobody home. I'll be right there. Holy shit she's real. You think it's her? Guys, we should go. Oh, sweeties. Aren't you just darling. What are you supposed to be dear? Sorry, to bother you ma'am. We were just trick or treating, but it's getting late so we should get and be-- Oh, of course. No, no, no, dear. Here. Here. Wow. That looks amazing And I can assure you it tastes as good as it looks. I don't get too many visitors this time of year. I bake so many goodies, but all the stories seem to keep many people away. Stories. Oh, yeah. Not what you expected huh? Not some scary hag of a witch after all. No, that's-- It's OK no harm, no foul. Why don't you come in? There's plenty more where this came from. Oh, no. It's really getting late. We should really go. People love the old woman company. Otherwise it'll just all go to waste. Here we go. Thank you so You have an amazing home miss-- Mary, Mary Frederick. Yes, not far from scary Mary is it. So are all of you lovers of the arcane and occult. What's that? Arcane and occult oh it's part of the inspiration of Halloween. Mystery and Lore that many have been inspired by. Do you know every story you've ever heard has its roots in the occult? Do you know this kind of story? Oh, I know all kinds of stories. Many about the wonders of the world. Wonders that sometimes cause great pain. April I'm so sorry to hear about you gene. Your grandfather was one of the nicest people I've ever met. And he always had a great story to tell. Thank you. That means so much. Now watch the table I have to go get more papas things from the attic. Now Matty. Where did your grandfather get all this stuff? He used to be in a circus. Are you talking about the big giant tent with the flying monkeys type circus? No, the real kind. Grandpa used to tell me about how you'd roll into town on the back of his favorite elephant man. And all the kids would love to get tickets to see him perform tricks, jump the plane circled. Balatine abuzz where everyone cheered them on. Hey, check this out. The petrified boy. See the bow of the terrifying child of the devil up close, but beware we can't go to leave the soul. Leave their soul? This is clearly fake why would anyone pay to see this. It's true. 1873 is one they found him. After the war they used slaves to build the railroad from New York to San Francisco. Used to use Negro children to take messages above ground. One day freight train with too much speed jump the tracks. Barren, the most notorious great master of his day found him. All burned up and left him dead by the railroad workers and the union leaders. Underneath mounds of coal from the trains love screaming, while slowly burning alive. The most mysterious and devious of them all. Her name it's so gruesome, so evil, so absolutely petrified. Folks he cannot be viewed outside the safety of these very walls because if only a slither of daylight were to enter this very room he would awake, and he would punish those who dare disturb his eternal rest. Ladies and gentlemen, I give you the petrified boy. Ben traveled around the country with his misfits of bearded ladies, and six legged tigers, but the petrified boy was always his main attraction. For years his caravan grew in size in his name and stature. Sold out shows far beyond their wildest imaginations. People were so afraid of the petrified boy that the very mention of its name would scare the patrons wallets thin. Then one fateful morning tragedy befell the circus. What happened? No, one knows what really happened to Ben, and his masquerade of performers. But your grandpa, your grandpa believed the workers exposed the boy to sunlight in transport. And the legend goes whoever disturbs the petrified boys eternal rest while face his wrath of vengeance. Vengeance he can never be cured for he must punish those who left him dying in the darkness. Thought there'd be more of his stuff here. Patty, I almost forgot go back to the shed and bring the rest of papas things. Make sure you bring your friend. The windows. There's lots of newspapers. Whoa. Whoa, that was creepy. Yeah, it was. Well, it is just a story. You know, I never got any of your names. Oh, I'm Nancy. This Tina, and that's Rod. Pleasure to meet you. You might want to take it a little slow there honey. There's plenty more to try. Wow. You make so much. Well, like I said I like to bake. Cooking and baking is a of a hobby of mine. Just don't have many people to cook for these days. Well, we'll be back for sure. Oh, aren't you the sweetest thing. So what do you do all day besides bake? Do you have a job? I used to a long time ago, but I was smart with my money. I saved enough to last my whole lifetime. If you're not good with saving you could find yourself desperate for work, and sometimes even the right work can bring the wrong results. As we gather here today still reeling from the tragic death of Gordon Rose. We seek to make sense of this to understand why? Why this happened. Why a young man was ripped from us so early. Unfortunately there are no easy answers. While God may know his plan we certainly do not. As difficult and painful as it is we must accept that Gordon is gone. They're great. I was a new kid at a new school. I got beat up a lot. But there was one kid who stood up for me that was Gordon. We've been best friends ever since. Follow me. I'm sorry. You're Carter here for the job. Yes, yes, I am. Follow me. So you're an editor, right? What school did you go to? Well, I'm from Kansas originally so I didn't exactly go to a film school. I mostly made my own movies, learn by doing. What kind of movies did you do? Horror mostly. Do you have any idea what we want from you? Yeah, to make the funeral videos. Life celebrations. Life celebrations. Here at Evergreen Cemetery we are proud of our commitment to help the living to blossom, Right. Gotcha. We need you to make videos of those who have crossed over. OK and what turnaround are you thinking for this? From the time I take the hard drive home to editing to giving you the final video. You be doing the work on site overnight. If that's OK with you. Yeah, that should be fine. Can you make a commitment Mr. Carter. Yeah, yeah, I think so. The young man that was here before you, Derek left us too soon. We don't want someone that will move on within a month. We want someone that will call Evergreen their home. Would you mind if I ran all this by my girlfriend first. You go right ahead, but remember there is a lot to be done. And we would like you here tonight if possible. Oh, great. Thank you. Thank you, for your time. I'll let you know she was possible. Fried tofu and a beef and broccoli. Here you go. Are you serious? What? I can't leave you forgot, Carter. Oh, the chili garlic sure. Oh, if I've only had some of the back here for you. Such a tease. So. So you should have seen this guy who I swear was creepier that creepy smelled like him too. Well, that's perfect. It's your favorite show. Yeah, but it's not why we came out here is it? I mean, we're supposed to be here making our own films, right? How far can we stretch your dad's inheritance? Do you regret following me out here? Hey, no. Baby, we're chasing our dreams and this is what your dad would have wanted. He'd be proud of you. I'm proud of you, and you're going to be the next Alfred Hitchcock, remember? And you want to be [inaudible]. Grace Kelly, she was his favorite. I know. I know. Besides think of all the great horror movie ideas you're going to get working at a cemetery. I'm glad you came back. I had a feeling that it was meant to be. Your first assignment is Lorraine. She was a sweet old lady, and I'm sure that you will do her memory justice. The hard drive is in your inbox on the desk. Thank you. Nice. Stay up, stay awake Carter. Oh, my God, I need a break. Yeah. How Hey, babe. How's your new job? Why did you send me that video? What video? Of Lorraine check your text. I don't want you talking about. I've just been here on packing. Who's Lorraine? Wait, wait, a minute. Wait, wait. Yeah, never mind. I'm sorry. I'm just pretty shot right now, so I just need some coffee. I'll be fine. OK, well, why don't you come home, and have a big sleep with me, hitchie baby. I just have to export this video, and then I'll be on my way OK. OK, I'll see you soon. Derrick, Derrick, How do I-- Oh shit. The last editor. This guy was my age. OK, James. Nice to meet you. I've seen that picture before. Hey, baby. Who the hell is Derrick? Who? You know what I'm talking about. Don't play dumb. Baby, I don't know what you're talking about. What kind of sick games have you been playing at, Heather. I'm looking at a picture of you two right now on my monitor. I don't know who Derrick is. He was the editor here before me, and now you've been cheating on me with him. I know you're scared. You will be OK. Heather, Heather, are you there? Heather? Stay with me. You're dead. You always dead. As we gather here today still reeling from the tragic death of Carter Lamb. We seem to make sense of this, to understand why? Why this happened. As difficult and painful as it is we must accept that Carter is gone. Well, I hope that little yarn didn't scare you too much my darlings. Not for Rod apparently. Luckily we don't have to start working any time soon. I'd hate to have to work someplace scary. Yeah, that's why I want to be a fashion designer. No, scary places for me. Yeah, I would never work at a morgue no matter how much they pay me. It's not like he wanted to he just needed the money. Yeah, well, I would never need the money that bad. You know your dad's not going to pay for everything you know. We're only kids for so long. I'd rather steal for a living. Oh, my dear. There are many repercussions of thievery more beyond just the risk of jail or prison. Rod, was just joking ma'am he wouldn't have the guts to steal a penny from his grandma. Well, thievery is no laughing matter. People take stealing too lightly. They are not aware of the dangers they're putting themselves in and police the least of your worries if you steal from the wrong person. Not everyone suffers because of the law some suffer different consequences. Are we really doing this? Sure, why not we said we wanted adventure, right? I mean, they're place in town we would go if you really want to get your fortune read. You're not got to do it here to carnival weird tent. Hello, anybody here? Yo you've got customers you want our money or what? Come on let's go we can do this another day. Hold your horses. Hold your horses. I'll be right with you. Well, now what have we here? Aren't you a wonderful looking young couple. Yes. Thank you. Sit. Sit. So what can I do to young folks for this evening? We want to get our fortunes read. Well, you've come to the right place for that my dear. What about you? Me? Are you here for a reading as well or just along for the ride? I-- He wants one as well. Excellent. Well, let's not waste any more time, and get started then, shall we? Wow. Your crystal ball is beautiful. Well, thank you. How old is that? Oh, hundreds of years. It's been in my family for generations ever since we first ventured into the mystic arts. Everything all right, dearie? Yeah, I'm fine. Excellent. So let's begin, shall we? Yes, please. No, where are my plastic cards. Must have left them in the back. Forgive me sometimes I swear if I didn't have my head attached it would go missing. Be back in a jiffy. You OK? Perfect. What are you doing? We said we wanted adventure, right? Come on let's take it. Come on let's go, go, go, go. What are you doing with that? You hear me? You get back here this instant. You'll rot in hell for what you've done. Oh, my God can you believe we did that. What a rush huh? And why did you do that? What do you mean? To spice things up that was the whole point, right? In fact I'm feeling a little frisky so. I think you're-- What do you say? --missing the point. I'm missing the point. Yeah, Abby. When we said we need to switch things up. I mean, doing stuff like this take things like that. That's not what we were talking about. No, that's not what you were talking about. So tell me Jonas what does excite you these days, having a Manhattan rather than a beer. Because that's going real big especially considering what you've already done. Because on a scale from one to 10 I think you've broken the scale. Abby, let's not go there. Oh, you don't want to go there huh? Well, I don't want to find out that my husband had to find excitement by going to another woman. I said don't we've already done that and work through it. At least I thought we did. I don't even know you anymore. Ditto on that front. I'm going to bed. Sure. Walk away just like you always do, but you know what even after everything you did I'm still here. You got do this shit like that again to spice up our lives. Do me a favor don't include me. Fine. Don't touch me. You ruined our lives. How'd you do that? What? Nothing. I'm going to go back to bed. You're not yourself you know. What? I said you're not yourself. I haven't been in a while. I'm going to go get dressed. What about breakfast? You eat it. Jonas. What happened? What happened? What is it? He was there. Who's here? The man. Who? The man from the carnival. The old guy from the carnival. The fortune teller. Honey, there's no way that man will come here. I swear. I just saw him. He was right in our bedroom. Baby, come on. I'm telling you. We're taking the fucking thing back. No, we can't. I've had enough of this. No, we're not taking it back. We're not keeping it. No, no, we're not taking it back. No, Jonas. No. I'm sorry. I didn't mean-- I didn't mean to. We're getting rid of this now. What the hell? Where did they go? There's no way they could have backed up this fast. No, way. I guess it's ours now. We're keeping it. Just trying to explain. We want our lives. I'm just trying to explain. Don't touch me. She never let me have anything. What? She never let me have anything. Do you know that? Not the clothes I want, not the food I want, not the friends I want to be with, not even happiness. I thought you did once, but you took that from me too. You ruin everything. And how could you? And all this time with her. I wanted us to say something and I did. About what? You were scared? You ruined our lives, my life, and for what? No, no, for what? Abby, please. A corkscrew? Abby, please. Don't touch me. I'm just trying to explain. I hate you. Oh, my God. What did you do? I didn't do. I didn't Do. I'm sorry. Ma'am, did you kill your husband? Miss Frederick. Oh, please dear. Mary is just fine. Oh, sorry. Mary, you sure know how to tell a scary story. Well, it wouldn't make much sense for people to call me scary Mary if I wasn't somewhat scary. So why are so many people afraid of you? Oh, Rod. What? It's just that there's so many stories about it. Yeah, no, shame in asking an innocent question. This town has always had a certain way of doing things. What do you mean? Oh, I just prefer to stay by myself, and the more I stayed alone the more they resented me for my solitude. So I guess making up stories was the only thing they could do to make me stay alone. Well, that's rude of everyone. Yes, it is. What about the missing kids? Now that I can't explain. Every town has its secrets I guess that just rather blame me than take responsibility themselves. Well, I for one never believed it. What? Is just a bunch of dumb crazy rumors. And crazy is the word, isn't it? That reminds me of another story. A story about just how crazy someone may or may not be. I hear you. I said I hear you. What do you need from me this time? OK, but I have nothing against Frank. You would know best. Sorry, friend. Sorry, friend. Let him go Gerald. I have my orders. Oh, man. Let the man go. I have my orders. I have my orders. Let him go Gerald. I have my orders. Don't worry about me, Dave. I'm protected by God. Blast me. God must be on lunch break because, Gerald here almost squashed your ass. No, one loves you. Gerald is mentally ill. There's a lot of that go around here lately, huh? You're going to be a good boy now Gerald. I am a servant of God OK. Let's move out of the way OK. Let me go, and finish his doings. How is it that God told you to choke Frank, and Frank said God protect him. This man is crazy. He is crazy I tell you. He's crazy. No warnings. One more time in the rubber room. It wasn't me. I like Frank. He's my friend. Frank tell them I'm a friend. You know what I [inaudible] you did, Frank. God doesn't speak to either of them. They're schizophrenic living in a dream. How do you know you're not living in a dream? I know what's real and what's not. You people who collect souls and torment cast them together with visionaries and prophets. You are the ones that confuse reality. You don't hear when God talks to you. And you hear, you listen. And understand. If Jesus were to walk in here and proclaim his divinity what would happen? He'd be called schizophrenic dosed with Dorsey. If you'd been living in Brooklyn for 15 years working in an insurance office without ever mentioning the minor fact that he was the Son of God until two weeks ago. Yeah, we'd naturally be skeptical. Up until two weeks ago you've never claimed to hear God, and you had killed your wife or your children. It was a test. God was testing me. Why would God want you to kill the people you loved? He told me he would destroy the world if humanity continued to ignore him. That I had to be the instrument of his will. Oh, OK. I didn't ask for this responsibility. How do you know you're no different than Gerald or Frank? I don't hear a voice when God speaks to them. Who else hears God when he speaks to you? Everyone. When God speaks to you everyone hears. Of course, if I was the only one who heard I would consider the idea that I might be crazy. Did anyone else hear God when he spoke to you in the police station? No, he whispered. Oh, yeah, he whispered. Did your wife hear God when he ordered you to kill her? No, she wasn't in the room. What if God chose to speak to you right now will I hear his voice? Yes. Well, I guess God doesn't have anything to say at the moment. Perhaps he is meditating or he is busy or he's on a journey. But perhaps he's sleeping and needs to be awakened. Kings chapter 18 verse 27. You tell me, Elijah how do you know it's God that's speaking to you? It sounds like the voice of God. So does James Earl Jones, but that'll make him Jehovah. Doctor, God talks to me and you hear that would mean I wasn't psychotic wouldn't it. Or that I am. And if everyone hears it mass hysteria. Let's cross that bridge when we get to it. That's a deal. A covenant. We'll talk again soon, Tom. Elijah. Yeah, Elijah. Elijah is here. There's a cloud as is a man's hand. Rise Arvis. Elijah, is here. Go up to Ahab and say prepare your chariot, and go down before the rain stops you. But Judge Judy's on. No, you must. You must. Come on relax. It's Judge Judy time. Yeah, hear oh Lord. Hear me that this is people may know that you are the true Lord God, and that you have turned their hearts back to you once again. What are you doing, Elijah? Did you hear that? It's probably somebody just messed with the PA. Yes, Lord. I have been very jealous for the Lord God of hosts, for the children of Israel have forsaken your covenant torn down your altars and killed your prophets with the sword. I alone am left, and they seek to take my life. Go out and stand on the mountain before the Lord. Yes, Lord. I hear your Lord. I hear you Lord. You've come back Lord. You heard it to? I heard something. Me too. This is crazy. It's not crazy neither am I. Come near me. He's a prophet of God. What's going on? Tom, what are you doing? Seize the prophets of Baals. Let not one of them escape. I am not troubled the house of [inaudible] It's you and your father have. And that you have forsaken the commandments of Lord. Tom, Elijah. I can help you This is just a psychotic episode. Is it? Hear the voice of the Lord. I am almighty God. Walk before me and be blameless. Doctor what is it? It's the voice of God. Is that you, my Lord Elijah. It is I. Go tell your master Elijah is here. How is he doing? It's getting crowded in there. He's speaking and responding as up to eight separate individuals. Is he still maintaining the delusion about hearing God? Yes, doctor although now all eight personalities can hear the voice. We are together now is one for the Lord speaks to us all, and we hear and we obey. And we understand. What are you doing, Elijah? Awaiting your word oh, Lord for Elijah is here. Whoa. Are you OK? Maybe the story upset his stomach. I feel funny. Oh, my, my, my I told you to take it slow with the sweet honey. I guess I did overdo it. Oh, it's OK. The sweets are fine. It's just Rod here didn't pace himself. Now all that sugar is catching up. I think I need to use the bathroom. Oh, of course, you do. It's all the way down the back there. Go on, dear. Right up the stairs. Maybe we should get going Rod should really-- Oh, no need. Oh, Rod is a big boy and the night is still young. He just needs to settle his stomach that's all. Oh, it must be the bathroom door it sometimes gets stuck. Now how about another story to pass the time. I'm sure Rod won't mind. This one is about a great artist. Killing him was easy, getting away with it was murder. I never should have trusted her. I never should have trusted any woman even one as beautiful as Ruby. I don't usually do this in the first date. Do what? Come back to some dude's pad. OK, I feel special. Yeah, you're special. Very special. So you're an artist. I'm trying to be. Right now I'm a starving artist, but when I'm dead all these paintings will be worth millions. I noticed you like to use a lot of red in your paintings. Well, there's a reason for that. I mixed my own blood with the paint. It's my signature. My old man is a painter. Your father? No, my old man. My husband. You're married. You didn't think I'd be available did you? I was amazed at my good luck. Well, it's about to get better. My husband is Oliver Prairie Oliver Prairie Oh, my God, I love his work. He's my biggest inspiration. So I noticed. And I copied his style. I actually started by making exact replicas of his early work just for practice. I didn't try to sell any of them, though. That would be forgery wouldn't it? Yes, it would. And that would be bad wouldn't it? Yes, very bad. You have something against being bad? It depends. On what? I know who I'm being bad with. I think we should slow down a little, so I get to know you. Sure. I'm sorry to hear. You're so beautiful. I'd love to paint you. Artist always say the word paint as if it was fuck. It can be even more intimate sometimes. Oliver's painted me although he stopped recently. In fact he stopped painting altogether. And I am saying the word as if it was fuck. Look I have to tell you something. I met Oliver, I showed him my paintings. He was very effusive with his praise. He bought a shitload of them. He told me one day I'd be famous like him. You'd better hope not like him his paintings aren't selling. Except to sell off almost everything. He is broke and seriously in debt. Oliver Prairie is broke. I find that hard to believe. It's true, flat broke, desperate. And I feel even worse about this. You shouldn't be here with me. I came home with you for a reason. What reason? You know what you said before about how your paintings would be worth millions after you were dead. I was joking. I'm not. Oliver's paintings would be worth millions after he dies, tens of millions. Are you saying what I think you're saying? I think I am. I think you're crazy. Why would I even consider? Because you did sell some of your early copies of Oliver's of his paintings, didn't you? Yes, yes, I did. OK, I admit it. I was flat broke, and I'm sorry now that I did it. But times were hard, and I didn't have a choice. So I figured that you might be interested in not being flat broke, and interested in not going to jail for forgery. Are you blackmailing me? Absolutely. And all you have to do is commit one little very profitable murder. Why don't you do it yourself? You're the artist. So you write that you should make Oliver's of his paintings immortal and invaluable. I never killed anyone. Your paintings are filled with bloodshed. That's art. But you paint with blood, Terry. My own. Artist evolve, don't they? How would we do it? Let's talk about that after. After what? After we do it. Right there. Right there. You did it. I did. Soon, baby very soon your money troubles will be over. Oh, this works. It will, you'll see. Wait, what? Yeah, look who's awake not yet lover boy. What's happening? What's happening? What's happening? You're about to paint your masterpiece my young friend. I don't understand. And you are correct. My paintings will be more valuable once I'm gone but you see so will yours. Much, much more valuable because you're a genius. Unappreciated now of course, but the legend surrounding your suicide, and the painting you left behind is your legacy will cement your place in the hierarchy of the art world. You're insane. You're insane. Almost definitely. How can you do this to me? I'm an art lover get it over with. No. Now I will have you sign your work. Stop please. Stop. No. It's done. It's greatest work in my opinion. He was a genius. I just murdered a great artist. And helped him achieve immortality. It also doesn't hurt that you own so many of his paintings, and I own so many of yours. Oh, sorry, Oliver. So sad. Two artists one young and unknown. The other older and past his prime we're in love with the same woman, and they mad at each other violently. I wish I'd been there to stop it. You fooled me. How could you? Oliver darling you never appreciated me. I'm an artist too. I call this my red period. That story a bit too much for both of you. No, I think I ate too much. Oh, it's the sugar rush. You've had the ups and now you're feeling the downs. Here. Thank you, Ms-- I mean, Mary. You're very welcome dear. Now make sure you drink that right up. You know we should really get Rod. No, I mean, I'll go check on him. Now you just make sure you drink that right up, Oh you'll need all that hydration to even out the sugar. Just wait there I'll be right back. I don't feel too good Nancy. Do you think Rod's OK? Yeah, he just ate too much. You know how much Rod likes to eat. What's wrong? I think we should get out of here as soon as we can. Where are you going? Oh, we were just going to get Rod. Oh, sweetheart he just left. What? What do you mean he just left? Why would he just leave? It's OK. He just felt like he needed to go home and rest. I let him out the back. No, we need to leave. Oh, Nancy dear you can barely hold yourself up. Oh, you need all hydration you can get come on drink up. Just relax and then after this last story both of you will be as right as rain. You asked for it. I'll wait for you to go to sleep so I can get Santa to give all your present. Shut up. All the presents. Mom. Mom. Get off of me. Hey, what's going on here? Hey, hey, boys. But mom. It's all make believe anyway. No, it's not. Take it back. Make me. You two bed now. Can you tell us a Christmas story. Yeah, a Christmas story. Please. Please. OK, all right, but after this no more messing around OK? I think it's time for me to read you all the true story of how Christmas came to be. The story begins as all do, but on this particular day of Christmas another tale was meant to be. It's a story about how the day of giving came to be, and it began with the Krampus earth elf. A tale of two brothers one from the light and the other of the dark. The elf was hard at work on a special tour for a little girl. Knowing that if the children around the world awoke to a tree without gifts and home without love but the evil Krampus would finally have this way and punish all the naughty kids who misbehave. It was then that Krampus appeared. You had to think quick. The Krampus and the elf fight to the death. Well, that's enough for tonight. Now you go to sleep. We have a big day tomorrow. I see your stomach couldn't take another story, could it? That's what happens when you take candy from strangers. Well, story time is over, but there's still time for dessert. I'm not eating anything else from you. Oh, it's not for you little sweetie desserts for me. Oh, the instincts of a child are so pure and innocent. If only you had the maturity to listen to them well. What have you done? What did you do to us? Nothing more than you asked for. You wanted a night of adventure did you? Something legendary. Tonight's going to be legendary. Will be legendary. How did you-- Rod. I just hope I lived up to all your little hearts desired. So tell me is poor old Mary truly Mary? Oh, oh, just right. I'll be right there.
