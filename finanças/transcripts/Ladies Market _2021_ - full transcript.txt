Fireflies. It's fireflies. I saw them when I was little. It was pitch-dark all around. It was because of the lights emitted by fireflies that the dark night became so beautiful. It is said that the lifespan of fireflies is very short, but they keep on emitting light as long as they live. If one firefly emits light, then other fireflies will follow suit. There will be spots of light all around, which is lovely. If only I could see fireflies again. Many people say I should stop daydreaming, and fireflies can no longer be found in Hong Kong, but I believe I'll see them again, for sure. Wake up. Wake up. Just wake up! It stinks! What a brat! Go to school... I'm leaving for school. Good morning, Store Chan. On the way to school, Lying Tung? Yes. I'm taking the school bus. Be careful. Look out for traffic. Okay. Store Chan, may I swap for another drink? I prefer orange juice. Suit yourself. Mr Liu, where are you going? Home. Oh no, I'm in trouble. Mr Liu, where do you live in Mongkok? In Fa Yuen Street. Where in Mongkok? In Fa Yuen Street. This is for you. Thank you, Ms Strong. Good morning, class. Good morning, sir. You are all very good students, and you do well in exams. Okay, let's start the lesson. A for apple. B for boy. Let me wake you up. It's 11 already? You're still reading? Don't slack off too much. Cook the rice. This will hopefully get us more food tonight. Come down later. Come down later. Lam Ho Yeung, why didn't you pick up my calls? Mrs Lam... She is Ms Li. I'm in a meeting. Can't you see? I've got something important to discuss with your boss. Get out, all of you. Just go. There's nothing to talk about between us, right? Yan has gone missing. -What? -Yan has gone missing. Shan Lao. Chu, what's your business here? Are you here to borrow cash again? You're talking crap. I'm not here for money. I just want to store something in your stockroom. Parallel imports or illicit cigarettes? Last time you stored some illicit cigarettes there, Customs Inspectors happened to come and I had a crap load of explaining to do. You should've shown me this earlier. For how long? -Not for long. Just for a while. -Don't make promises you can't keep. Let me be clear. Don't keep things there for too long. I got it. Did you? Yan. Your parents are never home. Why don't you play hide-and-seek with them? Hide here, and they will come and look for you together. -Okay. -Got it? Go and hide. Be good. Mr Chu...Didn't you say you would make a video? Right... Why didn't you remind me about something so important? Big Sis, why didn't you pick up my calls? I told you. I need $200,000 to buy goods today. I also told you. Forget it. Big Sis. How dare you block the car of Mongkok's Boss Fire Shoot? Is this yours? You'd better watch it. Excuse me. I'm talking to you. Dang it! Boss Fire Shoot. You just let this truck block my car? Is this your first day on the streets? How dare you dodge? Boss Fire Shoot, I haven't washed my hair for days. Your hand might get dirty. All you do is talk back. Boss. Police. Officer. Looking for trouble? I dare not. Her truck is blocking my car. I can't leave. You are not allowed to unload goods here. Okay. I'll move. -Leave as soon as you are done. -Scat! The car key. Here you go. Your truck is blocking the way. These two parking tickets are yours to pay. I'll take one box as compensation. Nuts! Getting cute with me? I'm leaving, Officer. I'm leaving. -King. -Yes. Follow Strong Girl. Make sure you get back those goods. Yes, Boss. I know what to do. Lying Tung. Where are you going? Lying Tung, finished your classes? Have you eaten yet? Yes, I had steak at the Peak before I came back. Impressive! You had steak at the Peak? Only a fool would believe you. You have never ever left Ladies' Market. It's already a bargain. How about I charge you nothing? Don't make a mess if you're just browsing! What a nuisance. You brat. How come you're so late? What time is it? You've been blocking my path to fortune. Do your homework. You're really so lucky? - Shan Lao. So early! - I quit. I lost everything. There's an empty seat... Why are you so late today? All the bad luck has been passed to you guys. Are you so eager to lose? -Hurry up. -Come on. How do I solve this problem? Doing your homework? Yes. Can you solve this problem? Chi Ho. What? He can't solve this problem. Let me see. This is so easy. I can read all of them, but I can't solve them. You should ask Shan Lao to hire a tutor. Chi Ho. Tung is good with numbers. He doesn't need to study maths, does he? Yes, even the Financial Secretary eats his heart out. Right? Big Sis, come and take payment. I'm coming... I have to go. Do your best, Tung. Thanks. Tall Guy, don't call this kind of low-scoring hands. You should do better. I was going to call a Great Dragons. Cut the crap. Pay up. Take this to Boss. Shan Lao, you're running out of money. Why don't you borrow some from me? Nonsense. I've got a lot of dough. I hope you can win too. Shan Lao, when will you send Tung to school? You shouldn't live from day to day. I'll think about it. Pong. I'll have a drink. Chi Ho, Boss wants to see you. A drink, please. Boss. Boss, be careful. Don't choke yourself. Be careful... Those three dumb thieves wouldn't go even though I let them take two necklaces. They thought they could rip me off? I could call the cops and get them arrested anytime. -Hurry and split the loot. -Okay. Pack them up. Food delivery. Police. Freeze! Police. Freeze! Boss, don't you worry that they'll tell on you? What do you take me for? Did I show my face? Excuse me. Not enough. Are you going to buy anything? You just keep messing around. -Leave if you're just browsing. -Let's go. Nuts! You're the one who is nuts. Freaking browsers. Why are you so early? Business is slow this week. Don't come here to drive customers away. Drive customers away? I know. This stall belongs to you and your younger brother, but I always treat Yin as if he's my own son. So why would I drive customers away? You're driving me crazy. Dad is here. How much is this? Welcome to Hong Kong. Buy some. Very good. -Mom. -So good. Someone's stealing. Who's stealing? He's gone. Is he? What a shock! Sweetie, so you're back? If you didn't come back, there would be no place for me. Don't mind my mum. Also... Yin mentioned the money... Say no more. I don't have any money for him. Pui Yi... Lend him your money if you want. Pay attention. Brat. Lying Tung. -Don't grab me. -Brat, I'm turning you in. Who's being turned in? You're so naughty. I have to turn you in. Go and find Shan Lao. Okay. I'm calling a 13 Orphans. Shan Lao... Shan Lao, Tung is in trouble. Tung is in trouble. What was he going to call? Is this really a hand of 13 Orphans? But he's gone. He doesn't want the money? Brat! You brat. Still want to run away? Follow me. Go. Go. Still want to run away? Store Chan, what's wrong with you? He's just a kid. Let's him go. What's wrong? Let's him go? You refuse me every time I ask you out for a tea dance. If you agree to it, there's room to negotiate. Otherwise, I'll turn him in. To hell with tea dance! Store Chan. Let's talk it out. Don't resort to violence. What violence? I never mind it when he lies. But do you know that he swapped my cola for tap water? I sold it to a customer and got a real tongue-lashing. Don't you think I should turn him in? Tung, did you do it? Tell me, did you do it? -Just tell me! -Forget it. -Forget it. -You speak nothing, so you admit to it. -Forget it. -What a brat! Just forget it. Come here. -Brat... -Shan Lao, forget it. Stay back. Brat... -Forget it... -Don't you go away! He's just a kid. I'll give you a good beating. See... Kneel! What should you do if you did something wrong? Say it! Otherwise, he'll really turn you in. I am sorry. Louder! I am sorry! Brat! -How dare you steal? -Forget it... Forget it... Say something nice or I'll be mad at you. I did but he wouldn't listen! Forget it... Don't do it next time. There won't be a 'next time'... There will never be a 'next time'! Don't be mad... If you keep on doing this, no one will take care of you. Tung! Don't be mad. Here you go. It occurs to me that somehow there are many police officers around. Be careful. Okay. You should have this. Here. One more wonton for you. Eat it. Have you eaten yet? It's dinner time. This chicken smells so nice. Stop covering yourself up on such a hot day. It's too stuffy. It'll be troublesome if you get sick. Why are you throwing a tantrum? It was your own fault! What did I do wrong that you beat me up so relentlessly? How dare you ask me? You stole and lied. If you behave so badly as a child, you'll surely become a thief when you grow up. It was you who taught me to lie. It was you who made me wear a school uniform, pretend to go to school, pretend to do homework at the stall, and pretend to be a normal child. You taught me all these things. What did I do wrong? You don't love me. I don't love you? How much pocket money do I give you? I provide you with food and shelter, and I don't love you? Those are not what I want. Then what do you want? I give in. Drink as much cola as you want. Stop lying. This is herbal tea. Cola is not good for you. It gives you asthma attacks. Eat your meal. Eat it. By the way, Cat Girl told me that she saw you talking to a social worker. What did he ask you? How did you answer? I told him I'm a Hongkonger. I have a father, a mother, and a younger sister. They teach Chinese in Mandarin at school, so I speak Mandarin so well. Also, I go to school by bus. So smart... No, don't risk it. Don't wander around for the time being. Okay. Here are some perks for you. After dinner, count this bag of coins. I'll give you $20 as reward. Okay. By the way, Mr Chu has stored some goods in the stockroom. Don't mess with his stuff. You'd better stay at home. Don't wander around. You're so sweaty. It was too stuffy. Dad, Mum, come and find me. Come and find me. Yan. Yan. Hello? What did you do to my daughter? Prepare 10 million dollars in cash, in non-sequential banknotes, I'll contact you later. Big Sis, open the door. I made a promise to pay up today. So what? That's your own responsibility. So you're not going to help me? You promised to take care of me when Dad was on his deathbed. Didn't I take care of you? You've attempted so many gigs, but you either suffer losses or get ripped off. How can I help you? Big Sis, don't be so narrow-minded. How can we succeed without taking risks? I don't want to be stuck in Ladies' Market forever. I have no money. No money? Then sell Dad's trucks, as well as his shop. Give me the truck key. Give me the truck key. Big Sis. Big Sis! Big Sis! Big Sis! Big Sis! Big Sis! Big Sis! Why won't you help me? Hello? Boss. Strong Girl stores the goods in Shan Lao's stockroom. I'll go there and retrieve them. Okay. I've arranged for Lui to pick up the goods. Get back the goods by all means, even if you have to do it by force. I'll send Chi Ho to help you out. One, two, three, four, five. Mr Chu has stored some goods in the stockroom. Don't mess with his stuff. What is this bag doing here? What's inside? Why are you here? Who are you? Don't cry. Do you like this key ring? Isn't it nice? How about this fan? It's so powerful. It can even light up. Alright. Let me show you something. I'm Bruce Lee. Lui, it's taken you so long. I've waited forever. Is that so? I had to climb the stairs. Stair climbing is good for your health. Where's the money? Take the goods here. Roger that. Please wait. Again? So you're Yan. How about we play a game? I'll be a teacher and you'll be a student. A for apple. B for boy. C for cat. What is D for? D for dinosaur. What 'saur'? It's 'dinosaur'. There's also 'tyrannosaurus' and 'velociraptor'. Didn't they teach you at your school? My school is crappy. Where do you go to school? In Kowloon Tong. Have you ever been to Ocean Park? You're not a Hongkonger if you haven't been there. How about Disneyland? Of course. Those in Tokyo and Shanghai too. This was bought at Disneyland. Someone's coming. Chi Ho. Why didn't you pick up your mum's calls? What's the matter? Your mum said she's run up a big debt in Macau and needs your help. Here she goes again. Take care of the matter for your mum first. Okay. I'll handle it tonight. Remember. Thank you. How is it? Strong Girl is inside. Don't close the door. Yes, I will. The stockroom has to be locked up. No need to. I've got the key too. Please excuse me. When will you return the favour? Also, how should we resolve what happened this morning? Why have you come to be like this? Do you know each other? Right, do we know each other? You can pay with your body. We should focus on the matter at hand. Here is it... We're in trouble now. It's Boss. Hello, Boss? I sent you to look for the diamonds, not to take a dump. I'll come back right away. Boss will be furious. Let's go back first. Okay. I'm taking you somewhere else. It's dangerous here. Mr Chu asked me to hide here. I shouldn't be seen. Where I'm taking you, you won't be seen. Fire Shoot, quit it. We should leave, if you haven't got them. Lui, this is a misunderstanding. Perhaps I hid them so discreetly that my guys weren't able to find them. I'll go and find them myself. Please make yourself at home. I'll be back in ten minutes. Wait for me. -Boss, no! -What happened? If I find out who took the goods, I'll chop his hands off. Boss, calm down. It must be Strong Girl. Only she could have touched those goods. This is my secret home. We are free to do whatever we want. Make yourself at home. Make yourself at home. Don't worry. Is this your room? Yes. This is my garden. And this is the toilet and bathroom, This is the entrance. This is the living room. This is the sofa. The TV is over there. Make yourself at home. Stop. What are you doing? What are you looking for? So? Have you found them? They aren't here, Boss. They aren't here? Did you take them? Boss. Why did you hit me? It's Chi Ho. Chi Ho? His mum has just got back from Macau and she's run up a massive debt. Boss, I'm with you all day long. I haven't left. You know that. It isn't you. It isn't you either. So you're the one to blame. Let's go. Go and see a doctor. Move it! Move it! Move it! Move it! -Dang it. -Move it. Excuse me... Stop running. Stop running. Hold still! Here! Go after them! Stop running! Move it! Excuse me. How dare you run? Stop running! -Excuse me. -Stop running! It stinks! This is what Shan Lao taught me. He said air-conditioning is expensive. Also, too much cool air is bad for me. Rub some balm on your body and turn up the fan. Then you'll feel cool. It's cool, isn't it? Yes, it is. Don't rub your eye. Have some orange juice. There's none left. Just a moment. You can still taste the orange. Yes, I can still taste the orange. Do you know how to play with a paper fortune teller? No, I don't. I'll show you. I choose 'east five'. One, two, three, four, five. Twist your butt three times. -What do you choose? -I choose 'south two'. Okay. One, two. Pretend to be a pig. Let me show you how to make a paper fortune teller. Okay. Write down your wish. It'll come true if it turns up. I wish that I could see Mum and Dad every day. "I wish that I had a home." Looks like they couldn't keep up with us. You go first. Find somewhere to hide. Don't go home for now. Cheuk Chi Ho. Make it clear before you go. Fire Shoot's loot has been hidden in your goods. It's all diamonds. They've gone missing. Did you take them? Are you nuts? Why would I take them? If not, why did you run? Because I had to save you. Otherwise, you'd have got battered. Found them? Over there... Let's go. Did you see Chi Ho and Strong Girl? They went that way. Go after them. Have you ever seen fireflies? Have you? I did when I was little. I think I was with my parents. All is a blur now. How's your mum like? My mum? I can't quite remember her face. She seems to have died. Then...How about your dad? My dad? I only remember that he dropped me at Shan Lao's and never appeared again. How are your parents like? My dad is never home. My mum is never home too. What do fireflies look like? I just remember lying on the grass. The sky was pitch-dark. It was full of twinkling stars. The fireflies emitted yellow light. They flew around very slowly, flickering. Just like the stars on the sky, they were twinkling. Slowly put your hands together, and you could catch a firefly. Then it would blink on your hands. I also want to catch fireflies. Let me show you. See. Lend me your phone. Why do I have to lend you my phone? Just do it. This is important. I need the password. "The loot is missing. The operation has to be put off." I'm sorry for getting you involved. So you know how to apologise? I thought you have forgotten all about me. Do you still remember me? How could I not remember? Li Pui Yi, class BA. You had a crush on me. It was the other way round. I remember when you were in secondary school, you said you wanted to become a police officer. I took part in the recruitment exercise, but I got expelled, because my mum... Let's talk about you instead of me. Didn't you want to become a secretary? I know. Because your brother broke his leg, and you didn't want to sell your dad's transportation company, you took over the business, didn't you? How do you know? I've roamed around Ladies' Market for so many years. What do I not know? Especially things about you. I'm fully aware of them, Li Pui Yi. How many people... can do what they want to do? Even if you can do it, you may not be able to do things of your own accord. Everyone has his or her own burden. It's inevitable, and irremovable, and you can barely breathe. I'm starving. I just got paid. I'll treat you to a chicken drumstick. I'll be back soon. Two deep-fried chicken drumsticks, please. Is it okay to hide that little girl in that stockroom? Who would go into Shan Lao's stockroom? Just give her dad a few hours to gather the ransom. Lam Ho Yeung is really rich. He can gather the ransom very quickly. What will you do after collecting the ransom? The girl recognises you. I'll just kill her. You'll go to prison for this. Aren't you scared? I'm just saying. After collecting the ransom, I'll flee abroad and enjoy myself. -Go...Number two. -Excuse me. Number two... Go... -Number two... -Shan Lao... Three? It's number two. Mr Chu has hidden a girl in the stockroom. He'll kill her. What nonsense is this? You watch too many TV dramas. I told you to stay at home. -What are you doing here? -It's true! -Come with me. -Yeah? As if! If you lie, your nose will grow. Go home! Store Chan. What is it? Lying Tung, are you here to steal again? Call the police. Someone is planning a murder. What are you talking about? Call the police? Can't you see some police officers over there? Talk to them yourself. What the heck does this have to do with me? How annoying! Chu, be honest with me. Are you hiding a girl in my stockroom? Keep it down. You can't let anyone know. Who's that girl? That woman is my mistress from the Mainland. That girl is my daughter that I have with her. She was brought here in secret. I can't let my wife know. So I let her stay in the stockroom first. I'll beg her to take her daughter back to the Mainland. How can you let that girl stay in the stockroom? Give me some time and I'll take her away. Okay? You promised. Over there. Don't you run! Let's go. Go. Go. -Go. -Stay there! Go. These belong to Tung. I saw him stealing from the stockroom. So what if you find the loot? Boss Fire Shoot will surely assume that you took it. If I can't find the loot, Fire Shoot won't be arrested. Kid, what are you hiding here? Why are you hiding here? Girlie. Where's Tung? Do you know where Tung is? Do you know Tung? We are Tung's friends. We want to find Tung and get back something. He's gone to buy chicken drumsticks. Then we'll wait for him here, okay? Okay. When he returns, we can play make-believe and pretend to be a family. You'll be Mum, okay? Tung. Did you steal something from the stockroom? No, I didn't. Many people are coming. We have to leave quickly. Let's go. Let's go. You guys search that area. Go. There. Come on. Let me carry you. Where have they gone? Keep searching. Let's go and hide in my home. What are you doing? Where are you going? I dropped something. It's so dangerous. What are you looking for? I dropped what I'd stolen from the stockroom. I have to get it back. I'll go with you. Tung. I bought you some rice with BBQ chicken. Wait for me here. I'll go and check on that girl. There. Don't cry or make a noise. We'll be dead meat if we get found, okay? Sorry, girlie. Did I hurt you? They're gone. Don't be scared. I'm here. Don't be scared. Don't be afraid. I've found it. Didn't you say you had to get what you'd stolen? If I hadn't said so, you wouldn't have let me get back here. Lying Tung, you're lying again? Yes, so what? How dare you talk back? How can you lie? Is this what Shan Lao teaches you? Yes. Shan Lao teaches me to lie. All of you know that. Why won't you bust him? I can only stay in Ladies' Market. I can't go anywhere else. You adults all lie. Even if I tell the truth, no one believes me. Now Yan has gone missing. If she knows that the paper fortune teller is gone, she'll surely cry. Calm down. Take a deep breath. Do you want to find Yan? Then you have to listen to me. Let's go. If anything happens to my daughter, I won't forgive you. Yan. Yan. Yan! Yan, I'm Mr Chu. Hello? How is Yan? Put the money at the intersection of Ladies' Market and Nelson Street. There is a rubbish bin. Don't play tricks on me. Otherwise, you won't see your daughter again. Chu! How reckless you are! You kidnapped a child? Keep it down. Tung said you're going to kill that girl, and it's true? I was just exaggerating. I just wanted to scare her. You shouldn't gamble so much, jerk. You're deep in debt. You even went so far as to kidnap a child. It's a case of the pot calling the kettle black. You're just like me. How so? You kidnapped a child. Why are you so agitated? Why are you so upset? Tung has no ID. I've tried my best to hide him for so many years. If he gets caught by the police because of that girl, he'll be repatriated, jerk! I'll kill you! Wait. Did Tung take the girl away? Let's stop talking and start looking for them. Cat Mum, have you seen Tung? No, what's wrong? Tung has gone missing. I worry that he might get caught. This is my home. Yan! Big Bro Tung! Big Bro Tung! The door wasn't locked so I decided to hide here. Shan Lao will surely beat me because I wasn't here. Impossible. Shan Lao loves you so much. As soon as he heard that Store Chan got you, he abandoned his hand of 13 Orphans. Let's hide. I'm an outreaching social worker working in Mongkok. Are there any adults home? Why are you looking for them? Are you Tung? My colleagues have been watching you. They found that you often wander around Ladies' Market, but you never leave. Have you asked enough? What's your relationship with Tung? We are... Tung's parents. It's no big deal. We suspect that Tung is not attending school. If you two are really his parents, the Social Welfare Department has reason to believe that this is child neglect and abuse. Child neglect? We've always loved him. Right? Right, Tung? Yes, every time Dad gets me wonton noodles, he gives me all the wontons. He also gives me herbal tea, and says cola is bad for me. Every night, he sleeps with me. He won't turn on the A/C even on a hot day so that I won't get asthma attacks. He really loves me. -Good boy. -You see? Tung, you shouldn't lie. Otherwise, you will get caught by the police. Big Bro. Yan. Are they really your family? Yes. This is my dad. This is my mum. This is my younger sister. Maybe we're mistaken. We'll follow up on Tung's case later. We don't need your attention. Just leave... Go...We don't need your attention. Take care. Goodbye. Go. That's it. Bye-bye. Can you really be my younger sister? I have to hide a little longer. No, they'll come and get Yan. We have to leave now. Who will come and get Yan? Anyway, we have to leave. Boss, here. This was what we saw here. What do you mean? Where is my stuff? Look for it! Useless. Chow. Yes, Boss. Boss, what is it? You... Hold this... What a coincidence! How fortunate I am! I've found it! What the heck? What a lousy arrangement! It's been a whole day. This is ridiculous! Lui, don't go yet. Why should I stay? We ran out of beer. We even finished eating the roast goose. We've found it. See? Action. Freeze! Police! Police! Freeze... -Police! Freeze! Police! Stay there! Come on. Stay there! Freeze! Stop! Stay there! Stop! Stay there! Boss, you go first. I'll hold them off. Okay, hold them off. Police! Freeze... -Stay there! -Arrest him. Fire Shoot! Fire Shoot, stay there! Fire Shoot, stay there! Stay there! Police! Stop! Action. Police! Police! Freeze... Stop. Let's go. Stop looking. -Police! Freeze. -Freeze. - I have nothing to do with this. -Take her to the station. Looks like we've got rid of them. Police! Stay there. Stop. Stay there... Stop. Stop. Stay there. Stay there. Stop. My fellow officer. So where are we going how? Tung, where do you want to go? Ocean Park. What time is it? The park will have been closed when we arrive. I want to see fireflies. Me too. Fireflies... Okay... But where can we see fireflies in Hong Kong? I know. My mum took me there when I was little. Go straight ahead. Fireflies. There are no fireflies. Use this as a substitute. Thank you, Dad, Mum. Good boy. Dad, Mum. Thank you, Dad, Mum, Little Sis. -Big Bro... -Little Sis. Little Sis. It's fireflies. Since I met you again in Ladies' Market, this is the first time I've ever seen you so happy. Tung reminds me of the past. Yin was also very cute when he was little. Just like them, simple things can also make us happy. This is what matters the most. No matter how hard life is, you have to be happy. Smile. Excuse me. - I have to pick up this call. -That's my phone! Little Sis, it's fireflies. Just like the real thing, huh? Hello? Fire Shoot has been caught. The loot has also been found. What's strange is that Fire Shoot's car hit a kidnapper of another case. There's a girl who is still missing. Is that girl Yan? Yes. Lam Yan Yin. How do you know that? I'm with that girl now. I'll explain when I get back. Sir, also... Fire Shoot has been caught. Could we conclude our operation? Not for now. Unfortunately, you have to stay in Ladies' Market for a while. I'll call you later. Why is this person calling this number for him? Why is he so secretive about it? Yan was kidnapped. We have to take her back right away. How do you know? If I tell you I'm an undercover officer, will you believe me? Thank you for believing me. But why did you go undercover? When I took part in the police recruitment exercise, the academy found that my mum is a gambler, so I failed the vetting process. Later, they told me, I had to go undercover. Otherwise, I would be expelled. I had no choice. Do you assume from watching all those TV dramas that all people going undercover do it for justice? But at least, you're not a real gangster. Shall we take Yan back? Yan. Your family is waiting for you. We have to leave. Can we stay for another minute? Tung. There will be police officers around. You have to get off first. Thank you. You'll see your parents later. Here. Keep our wishes safe. You can have this doll. Don't forget me, Big Bro. -Mum. -Yan. -Yan. -Dad. Are you going to get a divorce? We're not going to get a divorce, okay? Okay. -Have you seen Lying Tung, Tung? -Shan Lao. He was with us just now. -I think he's home. -Help! Can somebody help? -What's wrong? -Tung's here! Tung... Help, move it, help. Move it... Tung. Help! Help, move it, help! Eat it. Move it... Tung! Tung! Tung! Move it... You're so sweaty. It was too stuffy. Have you ever been to Ocean Park? Can you really be my younger sister? If she knows that the paper fortune teller is gone, she'll surely cry. Help... Tung, hang in there! Tung! Tung, hang in there! Help... Tung, speak to me! Tung! Tung, hang in there! Help... Help... Tung! Tung! Tung! Tung! Tung, speak to me! Tung! Tung... Tung, speak to me! Tung! Tung... "Expecting and waiting, doing it all over again every day." "Waiting for endless helplessness." "Flowers wither and blossom. Another era begins." "Will there be a future for me in this flowery world?" "I used to wish every day that I could leave this place,” "and look for that piece of heaven that belongs to me." "But without you by my side,"” "even the brightest sun seems like a faded moon." "Spots of firefly light have already been planted in my heart." "Even if there's the wildest wind and the heaviest rain outside," "I won't get tired; I won't be scared. I'm trying my best to learn to grow up." "Even if it is the greatest burden, I'll bear it." "It is just that tears flow from time to time." "Being this strong gives me a home." "Right?" "Good-bye, Dick Liu. In memory of you."
