Anything in this world is dealt and ruled over by money. Anywhere, anyone and anything is does for money and just the money gets it done. The money game is not like any other game. It maybe thousands, lakhs or in crores, to gain one must play the game. To make his father Home Minister Gurusingham, as the Chief Minister.. Mafia don Balasingham started the game to bring in Billions of euros from Italy to India. Money moved from Italy and reached Hyderabad. Sir, we unloaded it all. Today is your last theory class. From tomorrow you will be entering into the field. Man is controlled by only two emotions... Fear and greed. When fear controls greed, you’re a normal human being. Once fear dominates greed, you become a criminal. One vital reminder, we are not criminals But we have to understand the criminal way of thinking to understand the psychology of the criminal Hello! Pooja! Kindly switched off your mobile. Sorry sir. All of you have to submit your thesis in four weeks. I hope all of you working on that. Wish you all the best. Hello! I am in class Why are you calling me so many times? What? Surya! Didn’t I tell you not to drink and drive? Wish you said the same to the person who hit me. He must be reckless just like you. Booze, betting, night clubs... Stop all that and concentrate on your thesis. Only four weeks left. Doctors said I need minimum six weeks to get up and walk. I can submit only next year. I am here to help you, no? Why fear? What’s your subject? Gandhi! Gandhi! Sensational murder in Hyderabad Jubilee hills Mohan Gandhi kills two members of his own family. What is the real reason behind auditor Gandhi murdering his own family? Two murders in Hyderabad created panic among the citizens. Pooja! I am starving... shall we eat. What?? Eat. Dad...Does any father try to kill his own daughter? Of course! There are people who murder wife and mother as well, forget just daughters. What is the motive? Money is the real reason why so many crimes happen in the world. The very thought of a father killing his daughter scares me dad. I am so happy to have a father like you. Thank you so much dad for taking care of me even if mom’s gone. It’s getting late. Good night. Dad...take off your glasses. By the way, I have to meet some prisoners in Central Jail. I wanted your permission. No, It's too dangerous. No, I'll go. Hey, open the gate. He's Gandhi! Mr Gandhi... My name is Pooja. I am a psychology student. I need to talk to you as part of my research, you know. Please talk to me. I am a psychologist. I can dig out the meaning of what men speak as well as decode their silence. I know how to make you talk. Why here? This is the place of murder. I thought, may get any clue to make him talk. It’s risky to visit a house already seized by the police. I'll take care. Not you...If your dad seems me, he will take care of me. Nothing will happen...Let’s go. Dear! Chinnu! Daddy! Mummy! Isn’t this my doll? Who are you? I am your dad’s friend. How’s my daddy? He’s fine. He sent me to find out how you’re doing. Does daddy cry because he misses me? No... so he is also asking you not to cry and instead study well. Don’t tell dad I’m crying. He will also cry then. Okay..Why did your daddy kill your mummy? Why? Daddy is your friend, no. Didn’t he tell you? Of course he told me. But wanted to know what you heard. He told me not to tell anyone about it. Can you take me to my daddy? I will. Daddy... Daddy... Daddy. I can see the sprint in your legs when you heard your daughter’s voice and the tears in your eyes .Do you still want us to believe you tried to kill your daughter? I met your daughter. When I met your daughter, she has no scorn for you for having killed her mother in front of her own eyes But I have seen nothing but love. Look..I approached you only to work on my thesis. But after meeting your daughter, I thought I need to do something for her. I know what it means to lose one’s mother at such a tender age. I can relate to her. Please tell me the truth... I will help you. You cannot be of any help to me. I can. My father is Intelligence Chief for the State. Your daughter said you will always do her bidding... Now your daughter is again asking you... Tell the truth please. Please. I got a call two weeks ago that my boss got arrested. Not like that... I need to know everything about you, your family, your life, your profession... I want all the details. I was a loner since I was a child except Mr Rajasekhar who took care of my upbringing. Hence I have enormous respect for him. Good morning Sir. Focus on work instead of wishing me. -Yes sir. Did you finish the order trip for Dr Reddy’s Labs? It will be done sir. What about the Financial Report of the Construction company? Will complete it sir. Did you complete the Induction for the New Staff? Will do sir. Why do you always say, will do, will complete etc..all in future tense? Never heard from you words like “ Finished. Done. Etc.” Nothing in past tense, right? Will come sir. -See, again, future tense. Sir, please stop talking in tenses. I am getting tension. -There you go again. Sir..What about my increment? I will see What about my leave approval sir? -Will approve. My promotion? -Will give. Now you’re the one talking in future tense sir. I realized I need to counter you with the same tense that you talk to me about. Ok ok...did the client RR Client come over? Yes sir, he came. Asked me to manage the Financial Report so I sent him to Gandhi. Isn’t it past tense sir? That is present tense...You have had it from me! Can’t fudge the books of accounts to give an unrealistic picture about the health of the company when it is actually bleeding losses Not possible to change the financial reports. How much do you want? -Get up. Just do what I say . -How dare you... You’re just an Auditor. Is he the only one in Hyderabad? Nobody else? He was just asking a favour. Either oblige him or say that you can’t. Why did you have to react so wildly? We don’t react to do the work. We only react because he is asking us to do the wrong thing. I think you need anger management. You can’t question me for every action. At this rate, I will oust your job. It’supto you. Hello, I own this company . -He is the Chairman. Do I care if you are the Chairman or just a Watchman? Because I liked you when you interviewed me, I chose you as my boss. This concept looks good sir. Interviews are meant to select the desired employees, not to choose bosses. Because you answered my questions well, I chose you as an employee. Because you asked sensible questions, I chose you as my boss. Otherwise, it would have got nasty... And I would have selected another boss. Sir, this concept is even better. New Boss...You mean new boss? I will tackle you later. Gandhi! New batch of employees have joined. Need a small session of introduction. Didn’t you hear the boss walking off that he wants to see me later etc. I am not sure I will keep my job tomorrow. Why don’t you take care of these introductions? Me? -Yes, of course. Why the hell introduce someone like me to the new employees when I may not even on the rolls by tomorrow? Eat in leisure dear. Because I got an unemployed like you and made you a General Manager, Now you want to get a new boss...New Boss, eh? This is getting tough...how can you rebuke me in front of everybody else? What brother? Did you scold Brother? Yes, and he scolded me how! Aiyo..dear...Aiyo. Look...If you need to scold him again, do it indoors, not in public again, okay? Yes Madam. So, even my family loves you more dearly than myself. What family? Don’t we know where you head off for the weekend. Hey heyhey. Just because I wanted to have a drink somewhere outside the house... why do you have to give it so much colour? Please don’t create fresh controversies. That’s better. Dare he say something again? Just a phone call will do. You can search for a new boss and so can I search for a new... Understood mam. Understood But don’t have so much attachments to him. The day he will get married, all these relationships won’t stand. Hello Mr Rajasekhar. No girl, not even my real parents can take the place of the both of you... Anybody else...only after you. Careful... What’s this? Trying to life weights without a pound of flesh! Auspicious moments are passing...Walk fast! Hey... keep distance. We are an orthodox family. Did you even bathe? Yes, two days back. -Mom... He said `two days back’. How can I calm down? And shape is out of this world. I need to impress her. Aiyo...Sorry son...Get up please, get up. Are you okay? Careful! Sit down! One minute. I will set it. Slowly breathe...breathe..breathe out. Now look Okay? What Guruji, there’s some magic in your hands It’s all in what we eat, son. Means? -Come..I will explain Mutton... Chicken. Masalas and Alcohol If you give up all these foods and instead switch to sprouts and vegetables, your body will be in your command For whose benefit Guruji? For the sake of kids, son...for the sake of kids. By the way, how many kids you have? Two girls..And two more boys. I am in the process of finding the Chandrakala of those four girls I am going to father. Did you find her? -Almost there... I saw this lovely girl in the morning.. Nature’s bounty is in her body beauty Guruji.. When she lifts her head, drapes herself in a saree and then puts her hand around her waist... it looks like the crescent moon has descended to earth... Wow..Guruji..do you see the poetry in my words... crescent..nature.. Enough Her face looks beautiful even in her Aadhar Card. Whoever is her father must be a great lover too! Girl is gorgeous, I am stumped See my luck Guruji... She stays right opposite my flat. Your flat? Come, let me show. There, do you see the `D’ Block? - That’s ours. Let’s go...I will lure her from her flat to mine one day...hahaha... Oh oh 304 and 305. I hope his flat no. is not 304. This is indeed my flat. Oh my God, why did I give away so much? If he knows my flat no, he will realise I was talking about his daughter. Hello Where’s your flat? Yes 3...0...no, no...1..1...0...3 I mean eleventh floor...much higher.. I hope you got it sir. I am confused. He seems a Junky God. Beer Bottles, Pizzas, Chicken pieces. His health will freak out if he takes all this junk. Correct..Correct Guruji... Why am I caught in this vortex ? Hello.. -Yes sir. I hope you won’t take this junk and instead take sprouts, and Rasam with black pepper. Black Pepper! -It will be hot and fine. You see the results...Go for it, ok. Black Pepper Rasam with sprouts...From tomorrow. Served Hot -Fixed Guruji You please go inside. Please go inside. I will start in right earnest. Let me go upstairs and be on that job... Please go inside.. You please go inside sir. -Bye Bye... Chandrakala.. -Yes Did you boil the milk? -Yes..yes..yes..yes “Junky” is a fun tag to describe you What’s wrong if he knows you stay opposite him? No problem had I been decent in describing her... But I went overboard in describing her physical attributes like a Telugu Shakespeare. Correct...correct... I have used up all the words which describe a girl’s shapely beauty from the lexicon causing embarrassment to the old man Didn’t stop there. Over -talkative nature! You were unstoppable ...X, Doube-X, Triple-X dialogues were in full flow like Sunny Leone swimming . You have that verbal diarrhoea that I knew would land you in trouble. But how can you describe a girl you liked with such graphic details? I can’t mask my inner feelings for a cutie like that with dignified expressions. I express what I feel in plainspeak – not in polished ways like “ cute smile”, “What an attitude”. I can’t be cool in such matters.. and have to spell it out. Anyways, you can’t hide it for long. It has to come out in the open soon. Yes...but before that, the girl will be totally in my grip. Later, I don’t care how he reacts. Let's see what happens and how it ends. New India Shares drastically fell today after some financial details... got leaked which led to speculations about its financial health of the company. Oh no! Sir...it’s a new employee She didn’t do it intentionally. No sympathies here... her mistake ruined our company’s reputation. Get me the Dismissal Order on her immediately. I will sign it and pack her off. Sir, its her first job. Must have felt tense and rushed it. Just one letter is the spelling mistake sir. Just one letter. One letter? Why don’t you get your Dismissal letter too? I will sign both so you can both leave. Yes sir, she is very irresponsible employee. Let me get the Dismissal letter typed. Without spelling mistake. Do that first I am now very happy, you know? -Happy for losing the job? Job lost but life’s back. What? I salvaged my character during the interview.. Hey, go. After I reached the apartments, I discovered nature. Now I see future. What else did you find? Got my cab And I found a nut! Keep packing...I’ll... -Oh, he’s caught me Hey... What are you doing here? Why are you coming from there? Because I reside there... Now you’re getting confused. I think so...I mistook their house for yours and rang their bell. Are you convinced now Guruji? I’m confused. Didn’t I tell you about that waste fellow – Junky fellow I hear weird sounds from his flat but he is never seen. Okay.. ok. Come inside, son. Let me introduce my family to you. Just missed. Chandrakala Come. My wife Chandrakala My daughter Chitra He was the boy I met in the morning. -Oh. Namaste Namaste Madam. Ah Guruji, Why is your stuff still not unpacked? They were unpacked..but had to pack it again No! Your reaction is shocking like some bomb exploded. Chill! My daughter lost her job, that’s all. Anyways, it’s time for her marriage, son. Wanted to hunt for some good matches in our village Give one tight slap! No, no, not you madam. The guy who ousted you. How can anybody ever remove her from job? Idiot...Idiot..Idiot! He’s gonna bite dust, wretched scoundrel. Just a spelling mistake sir. Will anyone kick you for that? Spelling mistake? Which company is this? R V Consultancy Some General Manager called Mohan Gandhi. Bloody idiot! I will teach him a lesson one day. Yes, don’t leave him. He is a Bin Laden who assumed a pious name as Gandhi. My curse won’t spare him. He won’t get very far in life. Amen. Why so many curses Guruji. Leave him to reap his actions. Why fret over small issues? My friend’s company has some openings. Let your daughter join there tomorrow. Don't say anything.. Just say yes. Oh ok but no worries, son. We will take her to our village and fix a good marriage. I will... Ahhh. Is it him? -Yes, It’s him Oh God! Y es, It’s him. Relax, son... It’s ok. I will pick you up tomorrow at 9 am. Be ready. Monday morning. Okay. Ok son...By the way, Forgot to ask you. What’s your name? Mohan Gandhi. Gandhi? I mean Mohan Grandhi.... Grandhi Mohan Kumar.. Like North Indians, I put my surname first as part of the name. Hope you got convinced. Again, I got confused. No problem sir... as long as you don’t think I am lying. See you. Okay, be ready in the Monday morning. Bye, Guruji. Sir.. Sir.. Sir.. Sir...why are you leaving without giving an update? Please tell me sir... what happened today? To hell with your curiosity... Can’t you talk without touching me? You hid your flat no. from her dad. You concealed your identity from the girl. God knows, what you will hide from her mother, be careful sir. Hey HeyHeyHey..Don’t mess around with me. I will sack you..Mind it. Not that. Sir, waiting for tomorrow’s breaking news sir. Every day, if you have boiled cucumber before going to bed... ...your bowel movement will be smoother And use the Indian commode, not the Western commode. Why does the old man hang around on the corridor all day? Why doesn’t stay indoors? Oh my...now I have to climb up using the pipes too. Who is this fellow? Climbing pipe in this time? Oh My God...Thief! Thief! Hey boy stop. Thief! Thief! Dear! Where are you? -What? Did her mother see you? Why are you laughing? Do you know, you’re a big Psycho? She saw my back, not my face. Should have seen your front. Did you get disappointed? As it is, there are enough Psychos at office. Bloody life! Should have seen your front. (Singing a song) Are you asking about the garden in front of my house? Oh my..Even her mother is loitering on the corridor Have to manage somehow. Chitra! Chitra! Chandrakala Garu... You sing just like singer Chitra. Oh C’mon! Hope it’s all comfortable here Everything’s fine.. but looks like thieves abound her. The other day, I saw a thief from behind... he was climbing to the top... Let me catch him next time. How can you recognize him from behind? I can recognize him from the back Such talent..how is it possible tell by the back? For sure, I will nab him Looks like she has similar tastes. Ok..what brings you here? Ah..I was passing by just to enquire if everything is sorted or not. All okay right? Everything is fine... Careful ok. Goddamn it...So much energy getting sapped with these daily cover-ups. Chitra ji.. It’s getting late. Shall we leave? Two minutes. Bye mom -Bye What’s up son? If she sees my back, she will surely find out. Need to cover up What’s wrong with you? Nothing... Since we are leaving for important work, why don’t you walk across. It will be auspicious for her. So believe in omens and auspicious times is it? That’s so cute son. Okay? Can you go back further little further...further... ok...stop...stop... walk now. Very good guy. Remember, at 11.45 am the inauspicious time starts. You must reach office by then -Okay. Sure... Please get back. Thank you You sacked her from your company unbeknownst to you. why can’t you reinstate her? Why come all the way to me? Actually, if she works half day there, it will shave off six crores. You wicked fellow..So, giving money to her is safer than risking her with work! Risky yet...Just feign as if you are giving her some tasks. Ok sir. Did you see how beautiful she is? Beautiful! Every guy’s eyes will be on her.. Ensure she’s protected from everyone. So I have to give her both Salary and Security. All your responsibility. Take care... -Thank you ...of her. Thank you so much. My dear friend Hemanth. Ok. Bye. Congratulations. All set. I am mesmerized by your devotion to help me get a job.. Thank you very much sir. Had I not got this job, my folks would have got me married off by now, you know?

Always on phone? Oh! Hey Gandhi! Why are they all staring at me like that? Because I remain aloof from girls at office... And now they are surprised to see me with a girl at home. Actually, they got a bit confused that’s all. Please sit down, girl. -Sit. Sit Will join in a minute... Gandhi...Come... Just check if it’s alright. Come to the side, son.. Need to talk a lot. Did she give a green signal? What green signal? Or shall I go and talk? Look here Mahalakshmi..I just came here to introduce the girl to all of you. Don’t get too excited and complicate matters.

Don’t pretend excitement. Hi cutie...son. Hello! How are you Chitra? -I am fine Namaste Sir, how are you doing? -Namaste madam. I am fine. Chitra..Get some coffee for sir. Just coffee won’t be enough It’s been six years since you got married... Why didn’t he treat us atleast once for a good meal? Not even a missed call for courtesy sake, sir. When he comes home for dinner, he devours all non-veg to the bone and spares the veg to us as left-overs. At least Uncle is a gentleman, he has at least called us for lunch. Otherwise... Namaste Sir... -Talking about you... All eating food. No diet today. I think it is salad, sir. Don't worry... Don't hesitate sir. Bitter gourd juice -Ridged gourd juice No Snake gourd juice? Have that too. -Serves you right? For barging into the dining table as soon as you got invited. Eat. Chandrakalal ji please tell them They seem shy to eat more. Please have them sir... all are cultivated organically. Cultivated alright.. but you have to cook them too right? My father-in-law doesn’t know the concept in between cultivation and cooking. Isn’t it Sir? If you cook it, you lose vitamins son. If we eat them raw, we will be lost. Health is wealth sir. Here, take this..Ridgedgourd.. Especially for you. What’s this? They are just peeled of Ridged Gourd and you call it Special? He has atleast peeled them for you... But we are all eating it raw. My sympathies for you. I am famished sir. -Eat me. Why delay? Come have this. Your health will improve. We better stay hungry sir. Hello! Is it an Emergency? I just sat down for lunch.. Should I rush right away? Even I had to leave for the Emergency. Why don’t you grab something before you leave? -Please have something and leave. No, no,. It’s urgent. We’ve got to leave now. You can leave after finishing sir. -No, we’ll leave now and come again. You cribbed that I didn’t invite you folks for six years. Now come home every weekend for lunch. Come to the little den I will explain. Should I pack the meal so you can have it on the way? Good idea. Very good idea. Shall I arrange home delivery? My wife is suffering with labour pains sir. -No sir.. no. Please have something and leave. So far so good. The real problems started here Sir we unloaded everything Money reached safely. Location safe? 100 per cent safe.. Nobody can even smell of it. State Intelligence is mostly focused on us. Take care. Sure sir. Here’s the MLA list. Sunday 6.45 pm is auspicious time. All money should reach everybody by that time. Hi, Good Morning Hope you are comfortable. I am Arjun... Bharadwaj. And this is... -I am Prashant sir. I am somewhat short-tempered. So, for tranquility, I have this Prashant. Why did you guys bring me here? We got a tip that you got a sum of Rupees Ten thousand crores for a single transaction. Just an inquiry into that. Somebody misinforms you about me and you just arrest me like that? Do you know, I am a respected person in the society? That’s why we are talking courteously to you sir. So, Guru Singam...Are you the Financial Advisor to his financial affairs? Sir, the call you were expecting from the Home Minister is here. Hello! He wants to talk to you about Rajasekhar’s arrest. Please handle it yourself. Sir says, he will call you later. Sir, why bring in Home Minister for a trivial matter? If you answer my question properly, you will reach home in one hour. Just cut it. The phone will ring until you pick it up Rajasekhar ji...why are you complicating matters? Just cooperate please. Sir! Hello! I am Arjun...Bharadwaj. In half hour, he should be in his home. later...we will talk over. Otherwise Otherwise...? You...? What do you mean? How dare you...? ...don’t you have any other work, Don’t call me again? Put the bloody phone down. Put the bloody phone down... you nincompoop. Minister’s quota over now. Now, let’s both talk. I’ll pose easy questions. Who gave that money to you? Where is it now? Okay? No tension. Prashant! -SIr. Did you arrange all the things for Sir? Yes sir.. I did. Good! I want to talk to my lawyer. I just spoke to your Minister... It is not good for talking to your lawyers in Sanskrit. Everyone will get money into their account in four days. You can go now. -Okay sir. Sir, you called for me? Rajasekhar is holding my cash. Rupees Ten Thousand crores. Problem is, only Rajasekhar knows where it is. Your CEO is sitting on a cash pile of Ten thousand crores and warming his seat in jail now. And nonchalant about its whereabouts. You go to jail, meet him and tell him one thing clearly. In one week, the Assembly sessions will resume. I want the money back before that. Or else, warn him that nobody in his house, not even his dog will be spared. Sir, I will go and meet Mr Rajasekhar. You will get your money back. Please don’t harm anyone in his family sir. Please. Arrange a meeting for him and Rakasekhar Okay sir. Arjun Sir has given strict orders to disallow Rajasekhar from meeting any visitors. But since the Home Minister has requested, I have risked to arrange this meeting. You have only 2 minutes. -Thank you sir. Hey Gandhi... What is this sir? What is the cut he gave you for doing this wrong job? So, you also doubt me, eh? When our country was in dire financial crisis, that Home Minister helped us out... I thought he saved us when we needed him. What I later realized is that he exploited us. Now, he ensured to get locked into an option where I have no choice but to accede. At least now, tell me where is his money now? The moment I reveal that, he is going to kill me next. I know all about his intricate financial scams and illegal deals. He knows if I testify in court, he is the one in danger. Home Minister assured us he won’t harm you. But if you don’t reveal where his money is... Gandhi... - ...he said he will eliminate your family Arjun is here..he’s going to smell a rat. One minute -Come on Please ..Just a minute sir.. Out...move. I will have a problem. Understand. -Please sir. Buggers who are you? Chill.. Chill... Chill.. What a smart man you are. By now, you must have figured out why we got you here. Did you get it? I will show you something for better clarity. Let’s start a little show. Grandpa All of them are my men You like chocolates or cookies? Chocolates. I just bluffed to your wife that we are your cousins from the US. They are getting over-excited at being your cousins for the first time. What do you want? Information What Information? The moment Rajasekhar reveals where the pile of money is, you gotta tell me. Not to the Home Minister. Remember...My gang will be at your house only. But you are not our hosts... you are our hostages. Don’t worry sir... Everything is going as per the plan. He was wooing her while staying opposite our flat. He is always being the same. What is this, husband? You never told me about so many cousins. We couldn’t make it when his parents died. That’s why he is angry with us. Isn’t it? Look son, forget the past. They have come all the way from the US seeking for us. Don’t keep a grudge from past. Just leave it. Ok, go and get freshened up Hi Cutie. Come! Let’s talk afterwards. Go and get freshened up first Chitra, come and take the blessings. Sir, who are you? -Arjun from CBI May I come in. Yes sir. Thanks Ah..nice house. Is she your wife? -Yes sir. I heard you make good coffee Let me make one for you sir -Thank you. The criminalsin our custody is like our own lover coming of age. We have to keep a vigil on them... Who is coming? Why they are here? So, you met Rajasekhar, it seems. I mean sir... -Next time, you don’t have to meet him by subterfuge I will take you personally there. Go... Convince him.

The gang which stole the ten thousand crores said they will spare my daughter only if I keep mum about the whole thing. That's why I surrendered Arjun tried to meet me several times in jail to find out what really happened. But didn’t give him a whiff about it. Don’t worry Gandhi....I will speak to dad about you. The girl is my responsibility now. Gandhi... your father-in-law is no more. Madam, your time is over. Why do have to go through all this? He filled the void left by my father’s early departure. Now, I am not even able to perform the last rites for him. Are you Bobby? Yes..and you? I have come to meet Gandhi. Gandhi’s father-in-law died. Gandhi is not even able to catch a last glimpse of him. You don’t worry. I will ensure to get him out of jail. Thank you. -See you. Request to DGP sir for giving a bail to Gandhi on personal surety, sir Confirm sir. Grant him bail. Forensic reports have arrived sir. Thank you. Hello! -Yes sir. Connect me to CM’s office.

Shut up -Please.. don’t shoot Stop! Go back... go back... Bye, bye partner. Love you baby... I love you so much Shit! You know what you have done... Do you know what you have done. He is an international criminal. And you just helped the guy to escape. Damn it. Isn’t he the one who got arrested in connection with Gandhi’s family murder case? My foot. All lies. He is not the same guy. The story he told is that of Ramakrishna. Do you know the crime you have committed? What an audacity, knowing she is DGP’s daughter, eh? Sorry Uncle. They said they will pay me Rs.5 lakhs for this. I gave fake documents, fake news clips to Pooja and made her believe But, I did not realize that it would help a criminal I will not leave the bloody criminal Gandhi. He may be a criminal... but he is a genius, dad. Do you know what you are talking about? He cheated you and framed you in this case! That’s why I said he is a genius. I am not an easy one to fall for, dad. I did my Masters in psychology. He manipulated me in just two meetings and made me forge your signatures. And you praise him for that? You should consult a psychologist too Dad ... you are the police You do arrest when you find a criminal. I am a criminologist, I study criminals on finding one. No.. no. you can’t meet him. I won’t blame you for getting cheated, he is capable to cheat anyone. If you ever rate him on that, it’s 10 out of 10 in cheating. In my 20 years’ experience, he is the only criminal who escaped me He is not Gandhi. It is his hight of sarcasm He is a mystery. His only passion is money Only money. Money may be vital to us but for him it is as important as oxygen. When I was ACP in Mumbai Crime branch... Gandhi, India's most wanted criminal. I was deputed as a special officer to catch him I got from intelligence department that he escaped from India and operating activities from Dubai And I too went Dubai to hunt him.

It’s freaking 490 million dirhams Yeah, 490 million dirhams. Where is he going? Okay. I have scanned his whatsApp chat and phone calls. Looks like ten thousand crores of money is coming to India. But no clue as to how and when. Ah... Ten thousand crores. How magical it sounds just to hear each zero getting added to 1, isn’t it? I am sure. He is just a side-pin. There’s some other guy who controls him like a king-pin. Getting in details, I came to know that he put aside lots of cash without the knowledge of that Kingpin. Gandhi blackmailed D’Costa by using that information. What do you want from me? Money, 490 Million dirhams Tell me where and how it is going? I don't know sir. Albenoza Did knows. Please don't play with me. Sorry Sir..I don’t know. There’s strong security around him.. His location is very confidential. I don't care about his strengths. Tell me his weakness. Aditi She is a bar girl in the pub If someone want earn money, he should not any weakness other than money. Hello... Aditi. What's up? Are you enjoying the weather? Who is this fellow? I'll also join you.. coming. I’m basically a con artist, baby. I came to give you an offer which you can deny. That Balasingham has a crush on you and he has loads of cash. If we can encash that crush, it’ll be the biggest heist in the history. Think big. Our target is 10,000 crores. What the hell? The melody of money. Come... Join the gang. This is Aditi. -Hi. Our new crew member. Puttaparthi... Expert hacker. Bobby! He makes fake documents pass off as originals. If he fakes a passport, no airport can stop him. That’s me And that’s my darling...

Only Balasingam knows about it. He used live tracker (app) to watch the money flow. Why, he could’ve tracked the phone itself. No...impossible. Iphone is highly encrypted. It’s unhackable. Because of that, We join Aditi in our team. Be on the job, Aditi. Okay. Balasingam messaged me. Tomorrow 10.30 am Piemonte Hotel. Where is Balasingam. -Balasingam is not here... He is in other place. You have to come with me. Gandhi, Balasingam hasn’t turned up. But his men came. Puttaparthi... It seems Balasingam not here. I thought he asked me to meet in this Hotel No. Please Come. Move...Move... Follow.. Follow This way Welcome baby.. Let’s have fun. You’re looking so hot. Come here dear. To get the cash, you need to lay your hands on Balasingam’s phone for 30 seconds. Send a message “Jam Ready” from Balasingam’s phone. Immediately, our Puttaparthi will send a link to him. As soon as you click, malware gets installed. Later we can control his phone. Beautiful painting. Yeah. Can I take a selfie. Sure you can. Oh my God..My battery is dead. Can I use your phone. I don’t usually give my phone to others, honey. But you’re special. Wine. Little. You can do it. Please... Thank you honey. Are you done baby? Ah.. one more selfie. Thanks baby. And here comes a perfect selfie. Thank you. Wow -That’s it. Gandhi! All the cash is lying at the Port Area It’s about 25 kms from here. And 20 minutes go for the ship to start. What if we get caught? What’s this? This is cannon spray... very powerful. Just spray on his face and he will be knocked out for 20 hours After that, you can easily escape. Why care for the lipstick? It will get wiped now, right? You! If I caught. Hey like Siri Assistant... We will insert a voice recognition message “Go to hell” which will trigger an automatic call back. Tell me. -Go to hell Gandhi! Aditi’s caught! Shit! I will kill you if you not reveal. Puttaparthi... call Balasingam. What's your plan? No,he is not picking the call. You answer the call. What? Puttaparthi...why do you forget? You already hacked his phone. Now answer it yourself. Come on tell me. Hey Balasingam..Leave her alone. Who the hell are you? So, you sent her? Yes, I did. Send her back to me or I will come myself to take her. Okay come. Puttaparthi, I am leaving. Open the door. Yes, Aditi darling. What’s the position? I’ve locked myself into the adjacent room but he is trying to break it open. Don’t panic. Do as I say. Tell me about the surroundings. I see a table, chair, candles, curtains looks like a Bar room. What should I do, Gandhi? I did exactly what you said Gandhi. Not much time left. Please hurry up. If that door opens, I will die at his hands. Or I will perish in these flames. Hello Baby. Come on. Soldiers...attack! Hey Balasingam here we go! I will call you after I am done with it. Ok..? Leave! Let's go. Come on. Come on. Hey brother Long time..What are you doing here? What? Me? Brother? Not that brother... 10,000 crores... you see it’s all going out of grasp... So, let's make a clear deal. Ten per cent take it. What say, Partner? Not a small amount – that’s 1000 crores... 20 percent. This man will not change the expression. 30 percent Here’s the best offer...for lifetime-settlement 40 percent. Please don’t refuse this offer... Please partner... I want 100 percent and I want you. That’s not fair, uh...Haunting me like an adulterous husband. and making away with my money? As if you earned all this with your sweat and brow like a rickshaw puller? Why are you so emotional? Yes, I am emotional sir. As emotional as when someone separates you from your lover. Same feeling sir. Even mine is a love story... between me and my money. Missed him again. No idea, where he is gone. What’s the motive of remitting Rs.10,000 crores to India... I revealed all to the government. The CM played a role in me taking charge in Hyderabad as CBI Joint Director I got a phone call after few days. I know the Gandhi you’re searching for. Officer. You.? Surprise...I am under arrest. Why are you surrendering yourself? Because the old woman gave a banana to me. What? One day, as I was on the run from police, I was sleeping on the platform. I woke up and saw an old lady...with a banana. Did you grab it from her? Before that, she read my hunger and offered the banana to me. That’s when I realized sir...what is humanity. And I surrendered. Now shall we talk the truth? Sir, you believe how a Gandhi became a “Mahatma” Gandhi when someone throws you out onto a Railway Platform. Why don’t you believe how this Gandhi became a Good Man just by sleeping on the platform? What a dichotomy sir? Sorry sorry sorry sir. Horrible comparison. Does it tally with what you are and what you said ? Look! Just book a case against him in local station and send him in. You want to just file a normal case against me? I won’t agree.. File all cases against me...Section 123... Section 420...468..471..and then send me in. File all cases against me. Samba, I can provide the evidences you need for this. Hello! Venkatesh Sir, file all pending cases in the station too against me. Minimum 20 years... Minimum 20 years... should be the Sentence against me. Only then I will appear before the Court Else, I wont. I wont..I wont. Hey.. Hey.. Hey.. Enough! Hey... -Sir... Take him away I love the trinkling sound of the handcuffs Thank you so much Officer. Thank you. Don’t mind brother. How’s it? It’s kick ass Go. No matter. -Thank you. What brother? He uttered that to you! What did he say? -Mind means mind..Don’t means lost. He says your mind is lost. Did he utter that? Calls me kickass every day Means Kick you in the... He calls me NO MATTER That means you have no matter. Did he say that? See my dear friend. If you have any problems, fix it yourself. Because God is too busy with other works. He won’t listen to you. Like this we need to sort out Thanks a lot sir. You risked so much for me. You are hurting yourself while making others happy. You seem to be a good man. How did you land in jail? Money and Pain both are similar in nature. If you share, it halves...and doubles, if you keep it yourselves. I saw you as a friend and saved you. If you feel the same, share your story I won’t trouble you. Call. Call me... Brother... He is calling. Yes, what a performer. Did you call me, brother? Shares of that company experienced heavy losses under imaginations. So, Crazy. What a smart man you are? You like chocolates or coockies? Say where is that money sir. I beg you. Chitra, don't open the door. Chitra, Chitra! Chitra! By the way, Who is David? In the jail, he sympathized with Ramakrishna and learnt about his story. He narrated the same story and now won your sympathies. He used you to go to jail and used me to get out of jail. What is this Gurusingham? He says today and again tomorrow. Will he give us money or not? I know that we won’t get this money. I understood bro, you have no money and we won’t get the money. But, Sir will become CM here it seems. You know what happens if you vote against the Government, being in the Ruling party? You’d lose even that MLA post in hand. Still, we took so much risk to make your sir as the CM. One shouldn’t think big to become CM without a capacity to give 100 crores to each MLA. Bloody, I’ll finalise this today. Wait for four days, everyone will get their payment. If you say no... I’ve a son, Balasingham. Uncle, why are you disturbing Balu Sir? He said to wait for four days, right? Yes, let’s go... Come on, move! -Yes, move! Love you baby. Love you baby. I love you so much I love you baby. Hey, What are you doing here? Dad.. Shout as you much, your dad won’t be here. Because I told him about a tip off about Gandhi and asked him to come to Necklace Road He is waiting there for an hour now. What do you want? Since you haven’t yet considered my proposal yesterday. I thought let me make a fresh offer. Basically, I love partnerships and am allergic to relationships, baby. I somehow got connected to you the first time I saw you. Then, selected for life. I want to spend my money with you. I love you baby. One would say, ‘I want to spend my life with you.” What is this `I want to spend my money with you.’, eh? To hell with that. Anybody will spend life easily but to be able to spend my hard-earned money of 10,000 crores tells you how strong my love is for you! One shouldn’t love you, but study you in a lab. I thought I am a doctorate in psychology but haven’t passed LKG grade is what I infer now. That means you still haven’t understood my concept Have you ever imagined how life with me, I mean, life with ten thousand crores, is going to be like? The sound, the beat, the tempo, do you know how it’s like? "Watch me not like that, I am getting intoxicated" "My pulse rate shooting up soaring body heat" "Your agility is enticing me into the mood" "Even your blushes are sliding upstairs" "I made a poster out of our selfie on the wall of my heart" "Watch me not like that, I am getting intoxicated" "My pulse rate shooting up soaring body heat" "An ocean of beauty in a bottle" "So impossible to pack it all, God’s great!" "They must’ve rewarded you Superhero tag... ...in a package" "Which is the fuel that gives me courage" "Stand not apart from me, I will go mad" "You can seduce even Mr Bond" "You stirred in me a DJ mix with mass beats How you tied me with a love rope" "Watch me not like that, I am getting intoxicated" "My pulse rate shooting up soaring body heat" "You’re like a current that needn’t be “switched on I am connected to you" "My remote is with you Use it as you wish" "You’re the Cupid himself Your body defines the contours of love" "Pick the content that fits your range Watch my glamour" "Bring it on, the truckload of love!" "I am with you, here and forever" "Even the Censor Board will get shocked with our 'scenes'." "Watch me not like that, I am getting intoxicated" "My pulse rate shooting up soaring body heat" You think I will fall so easily just for ten thousand crores! So you will feel connected only if I give pathetic sob stories of Wife dying or child missing, is it? I will I will feel the connection but first unite this child and her father. Daddy is here. I just said because you should not shout. Convey my greeting to dad. But I love you so much baby. Hello guys... Ten thousand crores cash. We have got a chance to get both David and Gandhi now.. Three birds in one shot. How Sir? They are producing Ramakrishna in court today. Only he knows who is David, how David looks like because only Ramakrishna knows his identity. So before Ramakrishna dare open his mouth, David will want to kill him. If we plan well, Ramakrishna can be baited to catch David easily. And bait David to nab Gandhi. But he is... master in escaping. So security must be very tight. Daddy! Daddy! Chinnu! Chinnu! Chinnu! Hey, David... Daddy! Chinnu! Sir, protect me. Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! Surya - Sir.. He is David that we are looking for Send his photo to N.C.R.B.. Get all the details... Right now. Hey David... My threshold for patience is very low. Tell me where the Money is...Tell I don’t know where the cash is sir. When it comes to money.. I am a monster. Yes Sir. He is a bloody monster. He killed my family for money. All I know about him is that his name is David. And David is the one who came to the court to kill me. Tell... Puttaparthi..Doesn’t it make a lovely sound when the cash is counted or the bones broken? Hey, only three broken so far, 203 more to go. That’s all I know sir. And that’s what I told Gandhi too in the jail sir. I know nothing else sir. I'll tell... I'll tell. Crazy! Here’s the cash you asked for. Did you see that? You...just look at this. Bloody you...Don’t play drama. I will skin you alive. What drama? Haven’t I shown you the cash you asked for? There’s a money detector here like a metal detector. As soon as money is near, it gives a beeping sound. This is all fake currency. -What nonsense! I burnt the fake currency and lifted the real currency, isn’t it? Hello... Hello.. Hello.. The Gandhi on the currency note may not know it. But this Gandhi knows how to tell fake from real. Then what happened to the real currency? How do I know that? When we intercepted Rajasekhar bringing the cash from the money house itself, we burnt the fake currency Don’t know who did all this and how. Hold.. Hold.. Hold.. Hold Who asked you to burn the fake currency and flick it? I don’t know... I have only met him once. At Inorbit Mall Parking lot. 100 per cent, the ten thousand crores is all yours. Guru Singham has to be stopped from becoming CM. That’s all. All I want is revenge. He guided me step by step...every step of the way. From his version, it appears all the cash coming from the small house is fake currency. We know nothing about David’s boss how he looks.. or his phone number How can we catch him Gandhi? Game over Gandhi. I think we should take some other deal. Shut up! Where did David say he met his boss for the first time? Inorbit Mall...Parking lot. I think he said..B 25. Inorbit Mall. Parking Lot. B 25 Gandhi.. There’s a problem -What happened? Before I reached Inorbit Mall, the CBI team came and took away the footage it seems. It’s not easy to get hold of the CC footage. By now, it would have got classified as Investigation material stored in the CBI headquarters. So we can’t get inside there? We can get in. but getting out is tough. It is CBI Head Quarters..Fool-proof security. Every corner is captured on CC camera. What did you say? -I said there will be cameras. That’s it, we will get to the footage. How? They wanted to see the footage there isn’t it? All we need to do is watch the footage at the time they are going to watch. How can we see what they are going to see? -CC Cameras. Puttaparthi. Ok ok. Understood but hacking cameras is not that easy. Not easy to breach the network-layer security Not possible. -Puttaparthi... Please don’t disappoint me. How can you also talk like that? Try..Try Fine! I am trying to hack the switch that connects to the CC camera..It’s taking time. Let me try the router. Yes! -Yes! Yes..you did it. -We got that. We managed to track all his movements for the last 30 days... and observed the CC footage of the places he visited. The footage in Inorbit Mall looks a bit suspicious. Please see Sir. He is playing the Inorbit Mall footage. Here it is sir. Hey Bobby... We thought it is OTT but he is giving us the Big Screen experience. Man, we are so lucky. Wait... Wait... Wait. He has managed to hide his face from getting caught on camera. Rewind Play... Rewind again... Pause Whoever, he is damn smart. His face invisible to the camera. Who is he talking on phone? -Don’t know sir. Yes, he spoke for 7 seconds. It’s an incoming call. Lakhs of people would have got the call. So what? Sunday Evening Find it immediately. At 7.23. Thousands of calls would have poured in Gandhi. Impossible to track all that. That Location The Area Tower is in Inorbit Mall. Then, 100, 200 calls would have come in easily. Ok...now we need to screen them and find the calls which had run for at least 13 seconds he just spoke for 7seconds. Gandhi Call list. There are 4 calls with 7 seconds duration. One outgoing and three incoming calls. I have circled the numbers. See the last page. Chinnu, wear your seat belt like this. Okay. Hi Pooja how are you? Hi Chinnu... Hi -What’s this Gandhi? I called you to give some good news. There’s no more hurdle in our love story. We can easily get married now. Wow! Do you know why? Your dad is not a policeman... he is a stealth policeman. Now, we belong to the same family babes. Don’t utter a word more about my dad. Is this your number? -That’s my other number. My dad uses it. Yes..I knew that Chinnu darling... Chocolates, biscuits.. Chandini Hey, cutie.. let’s go come. Whether you believe it or not, the girl got her mother murdered... the girl made her father go to jail. The ten thousand crores was stolen by your dad. No way...My dad’s not like that. Go and check at home. You know how to check it very well, right? Chinnu, how is it? Come.. come.. come... You like the chocolate? Yeah! The baby will be here until you come back If it is proved that your dad is not a criminal, the baby will be door-delivered to you. If indeed he is proved guilty, tell me where the cash is...and take the baby. Come soon.. I’m gonna miss you. Hey Pooja... there’s no link here with our love story and this. I still love you sincerely. I am just giving you a serious warning. But... let’s keep the two issues separate. Daddy... your glasses. -Yes. I was looking for them. Thank you. Hello good evening sir. Are all arrangements done for sending the money? Sir, as per your plan, preparations are on to transfer the ten thousand crores to your account It will be done after preparing the works. Good, its a top secret. Becareful. You were right about everything. I want to meet you. Tomorrow morning sharp at 9:30 Mahatma Trust Building Ten thousand crores is coming... I love you partner You are my cute little partner. Tell me how much share you want. I want my dad. Surprise. -Thank you dad. This is what my dad gave me. I don’t know about the money. You do anything for money, right? Take these ornaments and bring back my dad, uncle. Where’s the cash? There’s no cash it’s all converted into Bitcoins (Cryptocurrencies). Virtual currency...Wow We can encash it anywhere around the world. Just one click and you can transfer anywhere. One bitcoin is equal to approximately Rs.35 lakhs That means, ten thousand crores is equal to... 30,000 Bitcoins. You transfer bitcoins to me, I will transfer the girl to you. In the end, a happy ending... happy ending..happy ending. I love happy endings. A criminal like you shouldn’t get access to it. Gandhi... enough. Do you know why Gandhi is doing all this? It’s his life dream for 15 years. Its' his life ambition. Chandra... Do you know what my ambition really is? Had you given me thousands of crores, I would’ve revealed long ago. Aditi. I am just like you. Same to same. IPL Player. Whoever bids the highest is my partner. Aditi please...I need this money. I have already told you not to link your charity work with me. Infact, Balasingam offered me more than you. And he offered higher for bumping you off. No! Gandhi... Gandhi... Hello Ambulance. There’s a good intention to save lives of thousands behind Gandhi’s resolve to steal billions, Pooja. We have seen his father who donated all that he had to help those in need. We saw his sense of despondency when he was helpless to save the life of his six year old daughter. We saw Gandhi’s courage after his sister died... and then his father died within two weeks of her passing after pining for her. Because he didn’t want to see others go through the helpless suffering his sister and father faced from disease... he is building a Super Speciality hospital. Gandhi. You mean the Mahatma Trust. It belongs to him. Then, why did he hide all this? He feared that all the good work for Hospital will be stopped because of the illegal connection. He was more keen to be a do-gooder than to be called a good man. Gandhi! You get tears in your eyes when you see another in need. That’s why Gandhi likes you so much. He loves you a lot Pooja. Whatever happens to me, my mission shouldn’t die. The hospital construction shouldn’t stop. No, it won’t. I won’t let that happen. Added Mahatma Trust as a beneficiary. Total money transferred to Mahatma Trust. You will get the message shortly. I love you baby. Here, all of you share this! Chandini... Hey Bobby what a performance! What diction! What a base!

I believe your story once.. got cheated How can I believe you again? Silly dialogues. Routine performance. We got caught because of your expressions and performances. Totally non sync. I did alright. She only messed it up. What did I do? Puttaparthi penned the whole dialogues. Why blame me for what you did? -What did I do? Hey, stop it. Pooja. Whatever happened happened. Let’s start afresh... Can you initiate that money transfer please. I should have Bitcoins in order to do that. Ten thousand crores is still lying in cash. Then why did you say that? In order to save the baby and tie you in. Game is... over. You happy Darling? See you soon. We waited so long out of affection for your father and out of respect for you. The no-confidence motion is on the day after tomorrow. If the money is transferred by tomorrow evening, your father will become CM. Otherwise, he will lose the Home Ministry also. Welcome.

Both of us are in similar situation. We both have no Mother. At least, his dad is desperate to meet him. Whereas my dad is keen to desert me. If I sell my daily quota of ten hours to the government, I will get a monthly salary of Rupees Two lakhs. When I am about to get Ten thousand crores in one go, how can I leave it just like that! Chinnu! How did Balasingam know about this location? I told him. -What...? Balasingam agreed to release Ramakrishna in exchange for information about the money. So, I told him information about which container carries the money, You spoilt our two year plans. Where’s the cash container? I won’t tell. Put the entire harbour in lockdown mode and search for that container, Okay sir. You search from this end. -Okay sir Search every container. Surprise, my love In playing cards, there are four Kings.

Amidst unprecedented developments, No-Confidence Motion moved against the Government has fallen through. Home Minister Guru Singam has been expelled from the Party for carrying out anti-party activities, according to Party’s high command. Hello! What sir? You thought of becoming a CM by giving us fake currency? Now we ensured you won’t even enter the Party’s premises. How’s that? If the money with us is fake, where is the real ten thousand crores lying? By replacing the fake currency found in cold storage with real currency, Gandhi away those ten thousand crores. I will catch him wherever he is. The Game is still on. Book a ticket to America immediately. I am not a non-violent person. But I follow Gandhi wherever he goes. Operation success, play smart without stupid emotions. Over to Las Vegas.
