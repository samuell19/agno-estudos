I heard her say the new partner is gonna be johnson or you. - Mrs. Von hoffman. - Such a lovely boy, unlike some who have yet to grow up. - Did you hear that i signed our friends on the coast? - Well, you're making all sorts of deals today, aren't you? - I'll see you tonight. And bring that delightful girlfriend of yours. Ciao, darling. - All right? Mm-Hmm? Nice shot, mr. Bellamy Eh? - Nice call, son. - Good job! - Ready, gentlemen? - So, each samurai fortifies a castle To defend the neighboring village From the other players on the hexagonal grid. What do you think? - It's perfect for ages eight to loser. - Mm, kevin based it on real history. It's neat, huh? - It's fascinating. Sweetie, don't we have a gala to go to? - Can i just fix my contacts first? - Hey, what's that gala that you guys are going to? What's it for? - My firm's just moving into newer offices. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. - Needed a bigger place for your ego? - Okay. Okay. Ready. Bye, kev. Good night. - Checkmate. Told you. - Yeah. - Mr. Davis. You remember jennifer. - Hello, it's nice to see you. - Will you please excuse me for a second? - Your jennifer's quite a catch. - Yes. - Which firm is she with? - She's with monroy and klein. - Impressive. - She's lovely. Darling, there's something I've been meaning to discuss with you. - Yes, ma'am. - As you know, We are hiring a new partner in july. - I haven't really given it much thought. - Of course you haven't. - Well, a word to the wise... a young man should be able to play the field, But a partner needs to project stability. - I couldn't agree more. And jennifer and i have been going out exclusively For six months. - Really? I know a certain receptionist who would beg to differ. Now, the choice is between you and johnson. His numbers aren't as good as yours, But he is a solid family man. I see. - Your jennifer would make some lucky man a fabulous wife. Don't you agree? - Yes. Yes, i do. - Enjoy the party. - I've gotta hand it to you. In the past year, you've really pulled your life together. You've got a new job, a great boyfriend. I was starting to worry that kevin was rubbing off on you. - What? You are so wrong about kevin. He's one of the smartest people i know, And he's always had my back. - Sweetie, i know that kevin's your best friend, And he's a puppy dog, But don't you see you're just enabling him? You would actually be doing him a favor By making him stand on his own two feet. You know? Tough love. - Come on! So my golden ticket came in today. Mr. Bellamy's interested in my game idea. - That's great news, kev. - Yeah, i've got a meeting on saturday. - Ah! Man! - The game is off. Bar exam's next month and i've only slept Two hours this week. - Yeah, well, you have to man up. Tonight's poker night. - Thought you had a date tonight. - Oh, she said, uh-- She canceled. I wanna meet somebody nice, Not too crazy. - That rules out all your past girlfriends. Oh, wow. Hey. - I gotta get back to the library. - Oh, come on. - I've gotta read up on tarts of contracts. - Isn't that torts and contracts? - That's exactly why i've gotta read up. - Yeah. - Anyway, we don't all have three-Hour workdays, kev. - Oh, may i remind you, i may not pay rent, But that house runs smoothly. It's a win-Win. - Maybe, but someday, jen is gonna move on, And when she does, you gotta get a real job. She's already got bryce. - Bryce is totally wrong for her. And she'll figure it out soon enough. I know her. What a terrific evening. And i thought that you were all tied up with work this week. - What could i say? I had to see you. - And i had to see you. - Mm. Because i wanted to see if something fit. - See if what fits? - Come here. - Okay. - My grandmother's engagement ring. - Oh, my gosh. - My grandfather brought this ring from the old country. He carried across two continents, But he used to say... he'd carry it to the end of the earth For the woman he loved. And now i know just how he felt. - Are you serious? Jennifer... what i want to know is will you marry me? - Yes. Yes, of course. Oh, it's beautiful. It's a little loose, but wow. - I'll get it resized. From here on, everything is going to be perfect. - Thank you. - I gotta check my messages. I'll be right back. - Mm-Hmm. - Uh, kev. Hi do you have a minute? - Yeah! I'm just going through my game ideas book. - Kev, we need to talk. - Mm-Hmm. Okay. - So you know how i said that you could stay here Until you got on your feet? - Mm-Hmm. - But kev, that was seven years ago. - Yeah, i know. Time flies. - Yeah. - Uh, so there's something that i need to tell you. - Okay. - I have some news. - Yeah? - Bryce proposed. Bryce proposed? Re--Really? What? Wow. What--What did he say when you turned him down? He cried, right? Is he crying outside? - No, kev. I said yes. - What? - Yes! - No. - Yes, i'm getting married. Look. - No. No, no. You can't marry someone After only knowing them for six months. - Oh, sure you can. If it's the right person, yes, you can. - No, no. Je--Jen! I've seen you take longer picking out fridge magnets. Okay? Could you just think about this for a second? - I have. I have thought about this. Wow. After the wedding, Bryce is gonna be moving in here, So i think it's best that-- You need to move out. - Oh! Who are you right now? And what have you done with jennifer? - Kevin, this is gonna be a really good thing for you. It will give you a chance to have structure in your life And get a real job. - I have a real job! - And nobody believes in your board games And your caddying more than i do. - Who's gonna take napoleon to the park? Hmm? Who's gonna feed the fish? You don't even know this guy. I bet you he doesn't even know what your favorite color is. Green. Your scarf is green, your dress is teal. It's a form of green. You love green fridays. - Kevin... it's time. It's gonna be a good thing for you. I know it. - Dad? - Kevin, how many times have i told you About blocking my car? A man's house is his castle. Consider my driveway a piranha-Filled moat, okay? - I'm sorry, mr. Henderson. I'll be more careful. - Kev, you look terrible, kid. - I had a rough night. - You should marry that girl. Mr. Bellamy. Oh, i'm sorry. I thought you were somebody else. - That sounds good. - Bryce. - Kevin. What-What are you doing here? This isn't your usual hangout. - I swapped. You too, i see. - Uh, this is chandra. Chandra, this is kevin. - Hi! - Hi. - Why haven't we met before? - Mm. - I thought i knew all of bryce's friends. - Me too. - Mm-Hmm. - I'll be right back. - Chandra's a business colleague. I don't know what you think you saw-- - I know what i saw, bryce. - Listen, caddy. I'm not serious about chandra, but i am about jennifer. We have a future together. Don't you mess that up. - Hi, kevin. - Mr. Bellamy... i-I gotta go. Jen, i saw something today. Um-- - Yeah, i know. Bryce told me you ran into each other today. - He did? - Yeah. He had a meeting with chandra. He said he ran into you. - You know about her? - Yeah, she's great. She heads up the midwest operations. - Wha--Okay. Okay, well, brace yourself, okay? Because i-- I hate to have to be the one to tell you this, but... she was all over him. - Kevin, is this because you want things to go back To the way they were? - What--No! No! I feel like my brain is about to explode! - Jen? - Yep, there it goes. - Oh. And how are my two favorite people? - Hi. - How's it packing, kevin? I know it's a bit of a shock, But you're gonna thank us for this one day, okay, buddy? Honey, did i leave my gold cufflinks in the kitchen? I need them for my trip. - Oh, absolutely. I will go get them. Too bad, caddy. Your meal ticket's been pulled. - Oh, you cheating jerk. - You know, if i wasn't schooled In the teachings of the dalai lama, I'd wipe that smile right off your two-Timing face. Mm. What the heck, huh? Aah! - Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey! - I'll get 'em to stop. Don't make me get my leaf blower, you two. - Aah! - Okay! Okay! - What are you doing? - Oh, honey. - It's a $2,000 suit! Ah! He bit me! We'll get inside and we'll get something on it, okay? Kevin! - I got it worse! He tastes like deodorant! - Kevin. That was pathetic. - It's not even funny. It's not even funny, man! Bryce wants a trophy wife. He's totally, utterly wrong for her. - Look, nothing you can do. Why are you really so upset? - Because it's jen. She's rushing into this. I just feel like this freight train is heading Right toward my best friend, and i gotta do something. If only i could just buy a little more time. She'd see for herself how wrong bryce is for her. And as her best friend, I have to do everything in my power to protect her. - Hmm. That's funny. In a lot of states, You'd practically be married yourselves. Common-Law marriage anyway. - Wait, what do you-- What do you mean common law? - It goes back to frontier times When people didn't live close enough to a city To get married by a justice of the peace. - Uh-Huh. Uh-Huh. - Lawmakers knew they had to do something So that people living farther afield could get married. So... they decreed that if people lived together A certain period of time, met certain conditions, Then the state would step in and make the whole thing legal. - Really? - It's called a common-Law marriage. - And how is this different than a real marriage? - It is a real marriage. If you've got a common-Law marriage, In the eyes of the law, you're a husband and wife. - Common law. Hi, jen. - Hi, kev. - Whatcha doing? - Oh, i'm just looking up ideas for the reception. - Hmm. - I've always wanted a gazebo in the backyard And this place has beautiful ones. - That's nice. - So, uh, how's the packing going? - I learned something important today. Something big. - Which is? - You can't marry bryce. - Okay, kevin-- - You ever heard of common law? Hmm? Well, common law states that a man and woman That have been living together for seven years--Like us-- Uh, and they meet certain conditions-- Well, they're considered married in the eyes of the law, Which would make us... husband and wife. - Who told you that? - Oh, jeremy told me that. - Oh, jeremy. - Mm-Hmm. - Jeremy told you that. Jeremy who's passed the bar exam how many times? - Yeah, okay. - Zero. - Fair enough. But, uh, jen? - Okay, this is ridiculous. - Yeah. Oh. Okay. This marriage is gonna take a little work. - Coming! - I dropped the kids at daycare And came over as fast as i could. Now about this little situation. - I feel ridiculous asking, But i have to be absolutely sure. - Don't look so worried, okay? - Okay. - In order for someone to be able to argue That a common-Law marriage exists, There are some very specific conditions that need to be met. - Okay, so this is all just nonsense, right? - Oh, i'm sure that you have nothing to worry about. - Okay. - So there are four conditions that must be met. - Four, right. - So first and foremost, The couple in question needs to be a man and woman Living in a state where common law applies, like here. - Mm-Hmm. - Right. - Second. They both need to have lived in the same residence For at least seven years. So you meet both those things. - Mm-Hmm. - Mm-Hmm. - Relax. So do a million people, okay? - Okay. - It's the last two that are definitely the most important. So during the seven years, The couple needs to have, at least once, Held themselves out as a married couple. And i mean, You never did that, right? - No! No. Like introduce him as my husband? - Okay. - Like, "hi, my name's jennifer, And this is my husband, kevin." - Good! Good. That's great. And i mean, you never, like, used the same last name On any public documents. - No! No, i have ne-- - What is that face? - Well, we took that cruise to mazatlan, And i might've said that he was my husband So we'd get the half-Off deal. - Right. - And, uh, don't forget the cable account. - And the cable account. - That's only three conditions. The fourth is definitely the most important. - Okay. - So the law specifically states That at least one of the two parties Must be able to argue that there was an intention to marry At some point, and the only way to prove that, There must be some sort of public exchanging of vows Or the giving of a symbolic gift. And...that didn't happen, right? - No! No, that never happened. - Okay. - Hey, what about that ring? - Ow. - Ring? What ring? - This. What? It's a friendship ring kevin gave to me. Please. It's not worth anything. His mom made it when she lived in a commune Back in the '70s. - So that is a family heirloom and kevin gave it to you. - What? - Look, jennifer, This is about an accumulation of evidence, okay? And right now, even kevin's dolt of a brother Could potentially argue that the acceptance of a ring, In itself, denotes the implied intention of marriage. - So are you telling me that kevin Might actually have a case That he and i are married? - Uh, yes. - Hey, honey. How's chicago? - Incredible. It's pure adrenaline with all these movers and shakers. - Bryce, there's something that i need to tell you. - So how'd it go with the caterers this morning? - Um... actually, something came up. I didn't get a chance to-- - You missed henri? - I'm sorry, okay? I just didn't get a chance to-- - Henri is a personal friend and the best chef in the city. He's doing this as a favor to me. - Bryce, i know. I'm sorry, okay? - No, it's okay. I'll handle it. On a lighter note, guess who booked the arboretum. Ha, i know how much you love it there. I had to pull a few strings, but voila. - Oh. That's great. - I thought you'd be more excited. - No, no, no. I am. It's--I am. It's a dream come true, really. - Now what did you wanna tell me? - Um... nothing. So... how was your flight? - Sweetheart, can i call you back in a few minutes? - Yep. - All right, bye. - Hello. - Hi. I'm bryce. Can i buy you guys a drink? - Please. - Yeah. - So as you can see from chart 2a, In its first stage of construction, We are at an occupancy rate of 89% for crystal towers. - Yeah. Ah. - Excuse me just one moment, please. Thank you. I'll be back. Kevin. - Hi. - Hi. What are you doing here? - Well, you're so busy, you know. You kinda took off in a hurry and you forgot your lunch. - Kevin-- - Yeah? - I just heard the good news. Congratulations! - Thanks! - For what? - Well, you two of course. Jen. Ha! I mean, i can't believe you kept this quiet. Hey, by the way, where are you guys registered? - Uh-- - We are not registered. I will tell you all about it later. - Okay. - I'm sorry. I'm sorry, i-- I was outside and they were asking me Who i was gonna come in here and see. And i might've blurted out that-- - That i was your... wife. - I'm sorry, okay? They weren't gonna let me in here, jen. I only told the receptionist and the doorman. - There is no doorman in this building! - Nice guy. Asian man. - Kevin... that is mr. Fujimura, my biggest client. Okay. - This is-- - Yep. Great, thank you. - Can you believe it? Me and kevin a couple. I mean, have you ever heard anything so absurd? - No, but... as your legal counsel, I'm gonna need all of the facts, you know? Tell me you guys were never romantic, please. With kevin? - Yeah. - No! Are you crazy? - Some women might fall for his whole hopeless teddy bear thing. - Yes, yes, yes. Okay. Okay, good, good. I like that. Okay. - Hmm. - Ooh, i like that, the offering. A peace offering? Nice! Let's see the pacifist. - Ooh, that's peaceful. Ha ha. Hey, jen. Um... we were just taking pictures For the warrior cards in the game. - So you're the one that put kevin up to all this, huh? And you consider yourself a lawyer? - Well, i'm hoping to go into environmental law, so-- - You wouldn't know a real lawyer If she walked up and she bit you. - Kevin, you and me! Outside! - What? But i didn't--Ow! - Kevin, that stunt you pulled at my office today Was completely out of line! - I was bringing you lunch. I was trying to be helpful. I was trying to show you that a husband can share the load. - Oh, you wanna share the load? Then deal with this. I'm supposed to meet my japanese financers For dinner tonight, And since you introduced yourself as my husband, Now they want us both to come celebrate. - Oh. Yeah, that's my bad. - Kevin should be here any moment. - Ah. - Hi. I'm just here-- - Oh, there he is now. Will you excuse me just a moment? - Please. - Hi. - Okay, so do what we rehearsed. - Yes. - You're only gonna be here a few minutes, And then you're just gonna go, okay? - Relax. - Okay. Mm? Madam. - No. - Okay, no french. Got it. - No french. - We up here? - Ah, please. - Mr. Fujimura, this is my... - husband. - Kevin. - Ah. - Oh, . - We are most honored to formally meet The new husband of jennifer. - Ah. - We congratulate you. - Oh. - Please sit down. Everyone, please. - Thank you. I can do it. Okay. - Oh, okay. Gotcha. - Can i offer you some wine? - Uh, yes, please. - May i ask what kind of work you do, mr. Kevin? - Well, uh, i am currently active In the recreational services industry, Specifically the golf sector. And i mean that i think of my best ideas On the golf course. - Oh, how smart. - Enough about me though, huh? Um, let's toast to your new venture. - Ah. Excellent. We are most excited to move forward. However, there is a small complication That is risen with the board. My coworker has informed me That several of the zoning permits Are still outstanding in this project. - Uh, if i may-- - Kevin, it's fine. - It's okay. I got this. Um... let me tell you a little story about jennifer here. A couple years back, Our garbage cans kept getting knocked over In the middle of the night every night. Did a little investigating. Turns out we had a big family of raccoons That had moved in underneath our house. And since it was, like, thanksgiving weekend, The animal control guy Couldn't do a darn thing about it. - Where is the waiter? - We had 20 people coming over for dinner. - Okay. - Jen, here, wouldn't take no for an answer, So with just an address book and a dying cell phone, Bam!-- In 30 minutes flat, She had the deputy mayor himself Crawling around underneath our house with a flashlight. Problem solved, and... you know, the point of the story Is that jennifer here-- There is nothing... that she can't accomplish or achieve. She says she's gonna get you those permits, Well, by golly, she's gonna do it. I shall relay that to the board. - That-That's great! Wow! You know, i know we don't really know each other, But i think we all have something in common here. We all think jennifer here Is just pretty darn amazing, right? Huh? Kanpai! Kanpai! - Yes, kanpai. - Kanpai! - Kanpai. - Whoo! Yeah! Get in there! To jennifer. - Sally, i can't believe it. - Is it horrible? It's horrible. Is it terrible? - No. Kevin actually-- He's being amazing. He pulled this whole thing off and he even saved the day. - That is definitely not what i thought you'd say. - I know. - How long did he stick around? - Uh, he's still here. He's at the table. - Wait, you left kevin alone At a table with your most important client? - And now the musical stylings of kevin duncan. - I have to go. - Yeah, okay, bye. - This is the captain of the pinafore. - Kevin! - Yeah. - This is not a karaoke bar. - Oh, yes, it is. For the h.M.S. Pinafore, yes, it is! Right? - I'm totally gonna lose my job. Mr. Fujimura, i am so sorry. This whole thing-- - I know this song! That's how i learn english. - Ooh! ? i am the captain of the pinafore ♪ ? and a right good captain too ♪ ? you're very, very good and be it understood ♪ ? i command a right good crew ♪ Both: ♪ we're very, very good and be it understood ♪ ? he commands a right good crew ♪ - ? though related to a peer i can hand, reef, and steer ♪ ? and ship a selvagee ♪ ? i am never known to quail at the fury of a gale ♪ ? and i'm never, never sick at sea ♪ - ? what, never? ? - ? no, never ♪ - ? what, never? ? - ? well, hardly ever ♪ - ? he's hardly ever sick at sea ♪ Both: ♪ then give three cheers and one cheer more ♪ ? for the hardy captain of the pinafore ♪ ? then give three cheers and one cheer more ♪ ? for the captain of the pinafore ♪ - Yeah! Fantastic! Triple threat. Triple threat. Right? - No. - Yes. Mr. Fujimura, everybody. - I mean, who knew mr. Fujimura could sing? I know. He's a triple threat. He can sing, he can dance. His origami cranes-- Terrific. I think he had a good time. He said next time he visits, He's bringing his wife michiko and the kids. I don't know what to say to you right now. - Was that a laugh? - Oh, no, i'm still very angry at you. No. You did good. It really was an unforgettable evening, so... thank you, kev. - Oh, it's not over yet. - What do you mean? What the--Kevin! All: surprise! - Behold, the wedding reception we've never had. - Yeah! Whoo-Hoo! Yeah! - Yeah. - I must admit, you throw a great party for a dead man. - Thank you. Mm-Mm. - Mr. Henderson, i am so sorry. Are we being too loud? I'm so-- - For years, i've been saying These two characters ought to get hitched. And now you have, you sly monkeys! - Thank you, but...no. - Would you please try to get kevin To stop blocking my driveway with his car? That way i won't be over here Banging on your door all the time. - Uh-- - Uh, will do. - All right. Par-Tay. - Move your car. - I know. I'm sorry. Sorry about that. Whoo! - Mm. - Jen! Babe, you here? - Bryce? You're back early. - Yes. You'd know that if you checked your messages. - I'm sorry, okay? Everything has been extremely crazy. - Yeah, so i see. "Congratulations, newlyweds." Did kevin finally snap And send away for a mail-Order bride? - N-- - Come here. - Actually... turns out jen and i are married. Crazy, right? How was chicago? - This is--This is a-- A joke, right? - No! We didn't get married. This is a big mistake. It just--It goes way back. - Way back. Yeah, there's history here. History that you can't even begin to understand. - Don't worry, bryce. - Let me explain. See, jennifer and i have what's called A "common-Law marriage." - And you've been hiding this from me? - No, no. Kevin drudged up this whole common law thing And i had no idea, And i didn't think that you would understand. - You're right, i don't. - Bryce, it's just temporary, okay? I am going to handle all of this-- This whole thing soon enough. - Well, you better. You get rid of this parasite or our wedding is off. Oh! And to answer your question, chicago was great. - Oh. - Sally? - Hey, jen. Okay, so i've been going over this crazy common law claim With everyone at the law firm, And it seems like you only have a couple of options. One, we can fight this in court, And you can spend a lotta time and a lotta money and maybe win. But even if we do win, You're not gonna get to marry bryce anytime soon. Two, you can get kevin to sign a document Waiving any common law claim, Which he won't do unless he has to, And doesn't have to unless you make him. - Look. As great of a guy as kevin is, he's always been a quitter. If you can make kevin's life miserable For just a few hours, Show him what it means to be a real husband, I think he'll crack and sign anything. - Oh, you think? I don't know. - It'll take a day, a week tops. - I don't know. - Honey, this is the only option. In the end, kevin'll thank you, But you absolutely cannot go soft. Trust me. Kevin folds every time. - I hope so. - Okay, i'll talk to you later. - Okay, bye. - Ow! - Good morning, sweetie pie. Since you are my husband, Today you get to help me do some husband-Y things. - Can we revisit this in, like, four to six hours? - No, i'm sorry. We have a household to run. - I--No. Okay. - These are the bills. This is a mortgage we need to refinance To get better interest rates. These are some brochures So you can call the various agents To evaluate their re-Fi offer. These are charts for life insurance. - And here's a warranty for the broken dishwasher. It may have expired. But you can handle all that, right, honey? - Can i phone in a lifeline, please? Hey, honey. Oh, so i just got done mowing the lawn, Balancing the checkbook, paying our bills, And i took it upon myself To set up a sep-Ira for us. - Okay, great. Call the shop and see when my car is gonna be ready. Then drop off the dry-Cleaning. Then go to the neighborhood association meeting. They need help with the bake sale. And there's a few other things on here, But don't worry. I made an hourly schedule for you. - Jen... do you want a husband, a chauffeur, Or a personal assistant? - Yes. So you ready to throw in the towel? Oh, actually... i'm ready to step up my game. - So how are things with kevin? - He spent all last night working on the gazebo. - Wow. That doesn't sound at all like kevin. - I know. I thought the same thing. - I don't know, you need to, like, Raise the stakes or something. - What? What's that? - Oh, kevin? Sally and i have a few errands to run And she's got the kids. You wouldn't mind babysitting for us, would you? - Actually, i was gonna meet the guys, Shoot some hoops, you know? - Oh. - Oh, that's too bad. - Yeah. - I mean, a husband has to have natural fathering instincts. - It's so important. - Very important. - It's, like, the most important. - The most important. - Mm-Hmm. - Mm. Hmm. I'm just gonna--Just gonna take this away from you. Let go. Let go, let go, let go. Let go! Sally says you're what happens if i don't do well in school. - Oh, yeah? Du-Doy! - Huh? Huh?

This kevin problem will be solved shortly. - Well, i hope so.

So, kevin forgot his idea book. - Oh. I know exactly where that is. I wouldn't want kevin to lose that. That would be like da vinci losing his sketches. - Here it is. Hey, it's a menu from waffle habit. Kevin and i practically lived there during college. - They had the best belgian waffles. Do you know they closed down last year? - Yeah. Miss that place. What is it that kevin-- Used to always say? He would say, "Don't rush through life. Stop and--" Both: "smell the waffles." We had some great times together, him and i. - I mean, that's my brother, right? - The guy who saved your slinky. Good night, jen. - Good night. - Can you believe it? The day before your wedding. - We made it through this mess. And now here we are at the rehearsal. - Ugh, finally. Both: cheers. - You look stunning. - Mm. Thanks. - Hey.

They can't sit near each other. Hatcher had dalton tossed off his board. - Oh, i thought it was peterson. Oh, okay. Then we'll just move them to table two. - Well, table two has the chens, Hatcher's biggest competitor. Didn't you double-Check this with my office? - Honey, i-I didn't have time.

I'll patch it up with hatcher When i see him in chicago. - You're going to chicago again? - Yeah, i've got to. It'll just be a couple days next week.

You two aren't, uh, nervous, i hope? - Walk in the park, right, honey? - Well, then let's get started. Jennifer, i trust the rings are ready. - Yeah, But it might weigh her arm down. Like her engagement ring? Biggest rock at the jewelers. - Jewelers? Bryce, i thought you said this engagement ring was-- Was your grandmother's. - What? I-- - Bryce, you said it. This engagement ring? You said that your grandfather Carried it across two continents, And he would've gone further for the woman that he loved. You said that to me. I know you said that to me. - Honey. I took a look at my grandmother's ring And the diamonds were just chintzy little chips. You deserve something more impressive. - As impressive as the story you told? - Okay, honey, can we not do this right now? - So, if you're both ready, We'll just do a brief run-Through Of how things will go tomorrow.
