What lens are you on? Can we get a camera set up over here? Thank you, Janine. I'm here at the New York County Courthouse, waiting for Lauren Monroe to give a statement to the press. Sir, one moment, please. Set it up over there. I'll be right there. Make sure we have full access to the SEC filings. Let's get updated lists of shell companies ASAP as well. And keep having everyone comb for discrepancies in the shareholder reports. I need a meeting with Haeven at 2:00. Please! I can't answer all your questions at once! Okay, one at a time. Katie, go ahead. What do you say to those who think that Wall Street has corrupted the justice system? Well, after my first year as district attorney, I'd say that my conviction rate speaks for itself. Victims and their families have always been my only concern, not bankers and brokers. Beautiful morning, isn't it, Lauren? Save your bullshit for the jury. - It's time we talk plea deal. - We did. I turned it down. Is it true that Thomas Reindorff's legal team reached out with a plea deal? A plea deal without restitution for the $3.5 billion dollars he defrauded investors is no plea deal I would ever accept. There's no way you can prove my client was aware of or condoned the actions - of a few rogue traitors. - Watch me. You can rest assured they'll face their own day in court for collusion. Ladies and gentlemen, please put your hands together for District Attorney Lauren Monroe! Your brother's running for reelection to Congress with less than ten days to go. A conviction would be very convenient in helping the family image. Thank you, thank you. My brother has one thing no other opponent does: tenacity. Ladies and gentlemen, my brother, Congressman William Monroe. And as far as my brother's reelection campaign goes, I'm sure he'd donate blood in exchange for your vote. Speaking of the election, is there any credence to the New York Post article that claims your brother traded favors in exchange for union support? Absolutely not. Desperation looks good on you, Robert. Your father would've told you to take the deal. Your client is a sociopathic liar that defrauded people of their pensions and life savings. We're just now getting in word about your father's accident. I... We just received notice that he was found dead at your family's summer house. Can you please comment on your father's death, Miss Monroe? Thank you. It's an incredible honor to be here with you. Lauren! One statement about your father! That'll be all for now. That's enough! Jackie, get them out of here! Earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust. Hey, take care, okay? Hey, listen, I gotta be back at the station at 4:00, but I'm sorry for your loss, Lauren. Thanks for all your help, Emilio. - Take care, okay? - Thanks. You're better at this than I am. Well, I had plenty of practice. You just nod and shake hands. A heart attack. I mean, how'd that even happen? Dad was in better shape than either of us. What are we gonna do about Mom? Just surround her with friends, And we'll find her an apartment on Zillow, closer to us. Look, I can only stay until the reading of the will. Campaign's a circus. Hey, Dad was proud of you. Maybe in public, but we both know you were the golden child. Can't believe it's already been a week. It's the beginning of the end. I know how to play the game. This game, like life, requires forethought. It's not about where you are. It's where you'll be in ten moves or ten years. You are not allowed to be average. We all have to put up with things that we don't like, so grow up, pick a firm, and learn how to win. Checkmate. "I leave Catherine in sole control of the family estate and my voting rights on the board of directors. To my son, William, I leave the sum of $20 million. To Lauren, I leave $1 million. $50 million is to be split equally between the Police and Firemen's Benevolent Fund and the Harvard School of Medicine. This is my Last Will and Testament. Archer Monroe." Thank you, Harold. That'll be all. I need some air. Thank you, Harold. Thank you for everything you've done for us, Harold. I know that you and my dad were close. There's actually... something I need to discuss with you. Your father left this for you and you alone. I knew your father for 31 years, Lauren. He was proud of the woman you became. Don't let the inheritance speak otherwise. Thank you. Okay. Lauren, it pains me to do this, and if you have received this, it means that I never found the courage to tell you while I was alive or... I died before I handled it myself. And for that... for many things... forgive me. We've all made mistakes. This was mine. It is a secret you must carry to your grave. You are the eldest, and as such, I think you'll understand why it had to be you. The answer lies buried near your fort. I must be vague in case of prying eyes, but above all things... the truth... must stay buried. Deepest apologies. Dad. Come on, Ted, how many years have we know each other? There is absolutely no truth whatsoever in the Post article. Look, my family has always supported you in the... Lauren, wait! Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait. Are you okay? What else would I expect? Do you wanna talk about it? No, I just... I just want a moment by myself. I'm fine. I'm fine. You look very pretty today. Two sugar cubes? Lauren! This is off-limits. Jesus! Okay, okay. 911, what's your emergency? Hello, hello? Hello? Ma'am, we just received a call from this number. Is everything all right? Yeah, sorry, um... My daughter was playing with my phone, so... I won't let it happen again. I promise. Okay, ma'am, please be more careful in the future. - Hey. - Hi. Listen, I don't know why Dad did that. Sure you do. What's wrong with you? You look awful. Just got a little queasy on my walk. Okay. Let's split it. I really, really don't care, Will, okay? Seriously. Use it for your campaign or something. I hope I still have your vote. Well, that depends on your policies. Weren't you supposed to be gone already? Yeah, actually, but you try pulling Mom away from her favorite granddaughter. Lose a hand. Oh. We built a beautiful life together, didn't we? What's wrong? It's everything, honestly. Your father was proud of you. Even when he didn't show it, he was proud of you. I know there's gonna be blood in the water, and the press are gonna be digging, pointing their spotlight on all of us. Are there any old enemies of Dad's that I should be aware of? We both know he was no saint, but that is not your burden to carry. It's mine. Well, I should know. Maybe I can help. You wanna help? Crucify Reindorff. Win that case and help your family win reelection. Good night, Claire-Bear. I love you. I love you too, Mama. Sure you don't want us to stay? No. I just need some time to think. But I'll see you guys tomorrow night. - I love you. - Love you. All finest schools, the most prestigious firms require... I don't want to represent your rich friends! Why is that so wrong? You are throwing it all away to be a civil servant, just like your boyfriend. Fianc√©. Okay, that's enough! - Both of you. - Talk to your daughter. You're acting like this is some kind of prison sentence. It is. Hey. Can you hear me? Hey! Oh, shit! Shit. Shit. Nice mask. Who are you? I like masks. Answer the question. Where's Archer? Tell me your name. John. John what? Doe. You think this is a game? You're chained up in a bunker, and I wanna know why. Show me your face, Lauren Elizabeth Monroe. You want answers? Look me in the eye and ask. Born November 7th, 1989. You have a younger brother, William. As DA, you advocate for the innocent and downtrodden to appease your conscience for being born into wealth and because you knew your father would disapprove. You used to bite your nails incessantly, unless, of course, you've kicked that habit. You have a daughter, Claire, a husband, Scott, who you married against your father's wishes. Should I continue, or will you take off that ridiculous mask? It's good to finally meet you. Who are you? I'd like to think I'm a member of the family after all these years. What do you mean, years? Exactly that. Years. So tell me, what happened to your dad? Oh. How'd he die? My condolences. So he left me to you. That's quite the inheritance. So explain yourself. A man in your position, only bad things come to mind. Are you good, Lauren? Who else knows you're here? Answer the question. Are you a good person? I'd like to think so. Then let me go. It's what a good person would do. You know it's not that simple. You got a lot to lose. I have already lost everything. I need to know why you're here. Your needs? Your needs? You wanna know my name? You want the truth? Well, I want the juiciest steak on God's green Earth. Rare. Baked potato, all the fixings. I want a Caesar salad, bread and butter, packet of Gauloises cigarettes, some chocolate, a newspaper, and a 30-year-old bottle of scotch, aged for every year of my captivity. You give me what I asked for, and I will tell you everything. I need answers. And I need a steak. And while we're at it, I want a shave. I wanna feel more like a human being again. Now, we both know your conscience, though pained, is not gonna just let me go, not yet. But when all is said and done, you will know the truth, and you will set me free. You're really gonna play it that way? Look around. You're the one in chains. I could just let you rot in here, close the door and walk away. But you won't. You really wanna risk that for a steak? Wait. I'd also really like a slice of key lime pie. And I would appreciate that shave. C-Can I have the light a little longer? Your father would only leave it on an hour or so after he left. This is Detective Emilio Sanchez, 75th Precinct. Leave me a message and I'll come back to you as soon as I can. Sanchez, hey, it's me. I just emailed you a set of prints I need you to get into the system ASAP. Call me on my cell. Bye. Hey, honey. Sorry. Couldn't connect to you for some reason. Hey. How was last night? Good, yeah. I was just going through some of Dad's old things. You wanna talk about it? Maybe tonight. I'm actually headed into court right now, so... Already here. Don't forget. Claire's recital this afternoon. Yeah, okay. Well, I love you. Love you. Bye. Ohh... God help me if that isn't the finest thing I've ever smelled. I brought you your food, so let's talk. And talk we will. But first... Mmm! Mmm. You can't imagine what this means to me. Thank you. What happened between you and my dad? You're not like him. I suspect you're better than he ever was. You've been deflecting my questions ever since I got here. How's Catherine taking this? She was always such a beautiful woman. My family is off-limits. A lawyer, a banker, and a politician. The unholy trinity. Quite the family. When I get back, you're going to tell me the truth, or it's the last time you'll see me. Lauren, where the hell are you? Eddie, I'm gonna be late for court. I'm sorry, but of all the days to be late? Yeah, I know. Look, I need you to run the trial. Haeven is gonna eat me alive. You're going to be fine. And don't let Robert toss the SEC filing on... I know about the SEC filings. - I'll be there soon. - Lauren, Lauren... 1-1/2 cup of finely crushed Graham crackers, one-third of a cup of butter or margarine, three tablespoons of sugar, a can of sweetened condensed milk, one-half cup of key lime juice, one container of whipped topping. Let's have some answers. Forgive me. I just... Once a year, Christmas, your father would bring me chocolate. Not a whole bar, just a little tiny square. It was my one treat for the year, then he'd put it up there for the rest of the year to taunt me, along with the pictures he took. Pictures? In the cigar box. What is this? It's my life. You, uh... You want some? It's all yours. My name is Morgan. Morgan Warner. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. It's been a long time since I had any human contact. You know, just to touch someone's skin. I used to smoke Gauloises cigarettes back in the day. It was a habit I picked up because I thought it would make me appear more refined. Get to the point. I was a foolish young man when I met your father. We had similar vices. Gambling, ego, women. That was the greatest time of my life. We became partners. Archer was fearless, but he couldn't read people. He was so young and careless back then. So you helped him become a card shark? Oh, no, he was already a shark. I just provided an edge. If there's one thing your father wanted in business, cards, politics, it was an edge. What happened between you? I was gonna become a doctor. I could've done so much with my life. - That night... - What happened? We'd had a few drinks before leaving the summer house for a big game in the city. We should never have been on the road. I'll never forget that sound. It happened so fast. My heart was pounding like it was gonna burst in my chest. And my mouth, I could barely swallow, I was so scared. He was just a kid. He was like us. I figured the only thing we could do was call the police and, you know, say there had been an accident. But, uh, he panicked. He said we couldn't. He said the cops would be looking for his dented car. He said he'd go to jail, that he'd lose everything. "If there's no body, there's no crime. If there's no body, there's no crime." He kept saying it over and over again. "If there's no body, there's no crime." I-I tried to do the right thing. My dad killed a man? It was an accident. But paranoia infected him. What happened to the body? We buried it. That is to say, your father buried it. I wanted no part of it. I wasn't about to cover up a homicide. You know, I mean, an accident is one thing, but... Maybe I should have. Maybe I'd still have a life. Morgan! Who was he? I don't know. You buried a body and didn't even bother to find out who it was? I had slightly more pressing matters at hand. What would you have done? Would you have buried him and walked away, or would you have made the call to the police? I'd like to think I'd make the call. Well, then you would be here like me. - Why go to all this trouble? - Why not just kill me? I begged him to. Days turned into weeks, then months, then so much time had gone by, he couldn't bring himself to let me go. He was scared I'd turn him in. I wouldn't have said a word. Not a word... if it'd have bought me my freedom. If Archer had a conscience, he would've just put me out of my misery. Instead, he offered me the chance to kill myself. But no matter the agony, the hopelessness, my life had meaning. My survival would be my revenge. But people must have missed you, looked for you. He said I stole his winnings, left the country. How do I know that you're telling me the truth? It's not like my dad's here to defend himself. I said your father had three vices. Poker, obviously, ego, of course, but we haven't even begun to discuss the women. One woman in particular. What does it have to do with anything? You said you could handle the truth. Archer loved your mother, but, uh, Sofia... she was everything your mother was not. Uncomplicated, unrestrained, free from conformity. Sofia wasn't an affair. She was an obsession, providing for Archer's darker appetites. He used to call her his Gypsy Rose. You must have had some kind of inclination... I don't believe you. Why not? Since the world has turned, powerful men have kept mistresses, and he kept her till his dying day. He wouldn't do that to my mom. Does any daughter really know her father? You're lying. I don't expect you to take my word for it, okay? - Why don't you go check? - How? He used to visit her every Tuesday, 72nd and Parkway. - Her name is Sofia Fiore. - Bullshit. If you don't believe me, go ask Harold. I'm sure he kept an entirely separate inheritance for her. - She was the love of his life. - Shut the hell up! If you're lying, I swear you'll never see me again. What if I'm not? Can you check to see if there were any missing persons named Morgan Warner during the late '80s? Morgan Warner. Yeah, okay. What's it for? My dad left him something in his will, and I'm trying to find out what happened to him. No emails. Just forward whatever you find on to my parent's summer house. All right. Well, I'm glad you decided to join us, Ms. Monroe. May it please the court, I'd like to offer my sincere apology to Your Honor and the ladies and gentlemen of the jury. What did I miss? Besides the birth of my 15 ulcers? Court is in session. Mr. Haeven, please call your next witness. 1-1/2 cups of finely crushed Graham crackers, one-third of a cup of butter, three tablespoons of sugar, one can of sweetened condensed milk, one-half cup of key lime juice, one container of whipped topping. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Press into baking tray. Bake for eight to 10 minutes. Leave to cool. 1-1/2 cups of finely crushed Graham crackers, one-third of a cup of butter, three tablespoons of sugar, one can of sweetened condensed milk, one-half cup of key lime juice, one container of whipped topping. Beat milk and lime juice together until thick and smooth, fold in whipped topping, spoon into cool pie crust, cover and refrigerate for one hour or till set. It's a dessert the whole family will love. Can I help you? I'm here to see Sofia Fiore. Your name, please? Lauren Monroe. One moment, please. I have Lauren Monroe here to see you, ma'am. Yes, ma'am. Sofia Fiore? Please come in, Lauren. Why are you here? I found your name in my dad's will. Maybe you can tell me how you two met. Do you really wanna know? Yes. At a poker game. And you were together for... He never stopped loving your mother, if that's what you mean. How long? Many years. I wish I didn't have to be here, but I'm just trying to put the pieces together. So I apologize for asking, but did my dad ever pay you for your company? We took care of each other. That care helped me earn a master's and a career. How we started is not where we ended up. Who is this? My son. Alex. Your half-brother. Jesus Christ. No... No one can know. This would literally kill my mom. Lauren, you came to me. We have our own life. And your son? He doesn't know you exist. I have to go. Mm-hmm. Right. Even for a lawyer, Harold, you're a goddamn snake in the grass. Let me call you back. Lauren, what the hell is going on? Sofia Fiore. What about her? All these years, you knew. Every family gathering, you lied to our faces. To my mom's face. I'm your father's lawyer, Lauren. - And his friend. - And as both, it wasn't my business to do either. You don't think I didn't try to talk some sense into him? - What am I supposed to do? - Walk away. And if someone finds out? She won't say a word. She never has. She signed a nondisclosure agreement. Of course. How much? Does it matter? How much? What else was my dad hiding? This is it. He's dead, Harold! He's... He's dead. My mom, my brother's career, my career. I-I need to know if there are more skeletons. Nothing that can harm you. What does that mean? It means... walk away. I've protected your family for decades. I know things I'll take to the grave. Your father trusted me, Lauren, I suggest you do the same. Did my dad ever mention a man named Morgan Warner to you? Doesn't sound familiar. I'd like you to help me find some stats, maybe old guarantees. - Also the research. - Got it. - Thanks, Jen. - Of course. Hey, Mom. What a welcome surprise. You've come to join the war effort? Ay. You know, they have a speechwriter for that. Yeah, well, we can't afford to make the slightest mistake. Not now. Not after all this hard work. - How's your case? - It's good. You know, that case makes me miss being a lawyer. Listen, I was going through some of Dad's old things. Some guy named Morgan Warner, does that name ring a bell? Morgan? I don't think so. We met so many people. Why? Oh, I just thought that maybe I could get to know Dad better through old friends. That reminds me. I have something for you. I will not let money tear this family apart. You deserve the same as your brother. I don't want it. I never did. Your father had no right to do what he did. I don't care you have to do. Just get it done. I'm surrounded by jackals. - Hi. - What's going on? Well, we got a sympathy bump in the polls, police and firemen's unions are backing us, thanks to Dad's donation, but my lead is within the margin of error. Some polls say I'm slipping. Goddamn New York Post article saying I paid off union reps isn't exactly helping perception. You didn't, right? Of course not. It's a smear campaign. But, Lauren, listen. I need you at the rally tomorrow night. Just give a short speech, shake some hands, kiss a few babies... It's the worst time. With the Reindorff case, I'm barely staying afloat. I know, but look, it's all hands on deck right now, okay? Mom will be there, the mayor. I need my sister to get up there, flash that beautiful smile and help us win this thing. I'll be there. - Thank you, honey. - Thank you. Believe me now? Why didn't you tell me he had a son? And ruin the surprise? How is Alex? This isn't funny. No. But it's proof. What do you say we take this off now? What else, hmm? What else do you know? Everything. I was your father's confessor. I mean, I hated the man, yet I lived vicariously through him. Each conversation was, uh... all I had. Look, I know this is a lot to swallow, but truth is, Archer only ever looked out for Archer. He was a bad husband, he's a shitty father, and a worse friend. If it's any consolation, he admired you for the mother you've become. I was a good parent because he wasn't. It must have been hard. What? Trying to please him, rebel against him at the same time. How do I know you're telling the truth about the body? Dig it up. Where's it buried? I couldn't possibly describe that to you after all this time. Try. The only way is to take me there. If you think that I'm gonna let you... You're a lawyer. You know the sentence for aiding and abetting a kidnapping, for false imprisonment, for torture, duress? I know the law. Yeah. No more games. Tell me the truth. I told you the truth about Sofia. I want my freedom, Lauren. I've earned it. Doesn't mean that you're not lying about this. Take me there. Dig up the truth. If you try something... I am an old man now. It's been such a long time since I've seen the outside world, it's probably gonna give me a heart attack. Ah... Move! It's more beautiful than I remember. Oh, God. It's almost too painful to bear. - Thank you. - Come on. I just... I took so much for granted, you know. Just the trees and the... the night sky, fresh air. God. - Let's go, come on. - Yeah, right, sorry. - Let's go. - Yeah. I'm gonna take this call. You're not gonna say one word. You're not even gonna breathe, do you understand me? Not one word. Hey, I've been meaning to call you. Where are you? You haven't returned my calls or texts. I left messages at your office. It's been a horrible day. I'm sorry. I should have reached... You can't just vanish on me like this. You remember Claire's recital, the one you promised you wouldn't miss? It's a huge ordeal to get her to go to bed because you didn't call back, you didn't say sorry, you didn't say good night. Yeah, look, I know. I-I total... I'm sorry. I promise I'll make it up to you guys, okay? - Your voice sounds like... - Look, I can't talk right now! Trouble at home? I'm sure Scott's just missing you. Goddamn it, do not talk about my family. You wanna end up back in that hole? - No? Then shut up. - Okay. - Move. - All right. I feel like we're driving in circles. We're almost there. Just keep going straight. Oh, oh, here. Turn down here. There, just to the right. Right, right, right. How far? Just keep going. For how long? Do you want answers or not? We're close. We're almost there, I'm telling ya. Oh, stop. Stop the car. Take this. Morgan. Morgan! There. That's where we buried him. Sit over there and keep lying on the ground. You move, I shoot. It's that simple. You sure you don't want me to dig? Your dad did. I prefer you in cuffs. Suit yourself. - When you find the body... - If! - When you find the body... - Shut up! I mean it. All right. There's nothing here. Oh, he's there. Where, huh? Where? Okay, this is all some bullshit lie. We're in the middle of fucking nowhere. Please, just trust me. How can I trust you? I don't even know you, okay? I'm already out on a fucking limb, trying... Light. Jesus Christ. Told ya. Shut up! So what happens now? Put the collar back on. W-We found the body. I need to think. About what? I'm... I'm innocent. It's not that black or white. I see, I see. Even now you are protecting your father. Not my father. My family. What about justice? Isn't that why you became a lawyer? What about everything I've lost? What about my mother, huh? Her son just vanishes off the face of the Earth? No closure? Not even a funeral? It's just there's no love or compassion, not even a window to see the sun. Every day, protein powder, peanut butter and water. Could you live like that?! Could you? Days that last as long as years! Nothing to celebrate! Just one fucking piece of chocolate every Christmas! What do you want me to say? I didn't do this to you! But you could change it! If you walk away, you're worse than he is. Will you be able to look into Scott's eyes? Or Claire's? Or yours? Put it back on! I am an innocent man. You give me my life back. Put it on! - All right, all right. - Put it on. This is not my responsibility, do you understand me? I didn't ask for this. This is not my fault. You think just because you show me a body, and you told me about his mistress that that means I believe you, and I trust you? It doesn't prove anything. It doesn't prove anything! It proves everything! - Come on. - I need more. What do you want from me, to just conjure evidence? Your father erased every trace of my existence! You gotta give me something else! I can't! I can't! Goddamn it! You're just like your father! You offer false hope, and then you just take it all away. God knows how many good years I've got, Lauren. Just, please, let me have them. Oh, God. All right. Look, I know what you're thinking, okay? And I understand. "If I set him free, is he gonna go to the cops or the media? Is he gonna destroy my family name? My brother's political career? My career? Am I gonna break your mother's heart?" I swear, I swear I will just, I will vanish. I just wanna salvage what few years I have left. Please, please, Lauren. Be a good person. I beg you. I beg you. Thank you. Thank you. I'm sorry. I'm... I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. No. Lauren! Pick up, pick up! All you two care about is money and legacy. I know that it's late, but I really need that missing persons information ASAP, okay? What's going on with that? I don't have it yet. Show me your face. Privilege is not given. It's earned. I know exactly the kind of person it takes to earn your privilege. A lawyer, a banker, and a politician. - It's in a warehouse in Queens. - Fuck! The unholy trinity. I want my freedom. Send the hard copy file to the Monroe manor. Dad, say something. Close the door on your way out. It is protected, and it has a price. Quite the family. Checkmate. I'm so sorry, Claire-bear. I love you. I love you too, Mommy. The congressional race is in a dead heat. With only two days to go, each candidate is pulling out all the stops. Incumbent William Monroe is trying to lock down his second term in the face of allegations that his campaign has been trading favors for union vo... Bring me up to speed before we begin. Here's the updated list of shell companies from forensic accounting. Give me the highlights. All rise! Please be seated. To be very clear for the jury, confirm how many traders worked on behalf of their clients, in full control of their own accounts, outside of Mr. Reindorff's direct supervision? - 324. - 324. And how many trades a day were completed on average by these 324 traders? Around 2,500. - 2,500 trades a day? - That's correct. I further put it to you that Ms. Monroe, desperate to step out of her late father's shoes... She's dragging my client's impeccable reputation through the mud. The state should be ashamed of her. Your witness, Ms. Monroe. Ms. Monroe? Ms. Monroe! No questions, Your Honor. In that case, this court is adjourned until 9 a.m. tomorrow morning. The witness is free to step down. I'll call you later. You don't call ahead anymore? Did you set up the account? - What is this? - Gypsy Rose, LLC. I'm not at liberty... Stop! I don't wanna hear it. I can't hear it. This is a major conflict of interest! My own father is a co-conspirator in my goddamn case. - Lauren... - Jesus Christ, Harold! I asked you if there was anything else that could hurt us, and you said no. You said... Stop asking questions you don't want answers to! Lauren, ignorance is deniability, so walk away. I don't know anything about Gypsy Rose, and neither do you. Just get that proposal on my desk and set up a meeting with the labor board, please. No later than Friday. Hey. What are you doing here? Is everything okay? Yeah, I, um... - I just needed some advice. - About the Reindorff case? No, I have a legal situation I need to talk through. Oh, okay. Well, hit me. The details are complicated, but the gist is this. A guy has blackmail material that could ruin your life, ruin your family's life, destroy everything you've built. He just needs some money to start a new life. Whatever it takes. Family comes first. Before a clear conscience? Well, yeah, in our business, that's rarer than the virgin birth. Okay, say I'm that guy. What did I do? Hypothetically? - Hypothetically. - Okay. Well, you know the guy killed a man, and you are threatening to expose him. Just plead him out or walk away. It's not like you're ever gonna run out of cases to try. Okay. Look, all I know is, if someone was threatening our family, I'd either pay him off or dump his body in the river. And you know what Dad would've done. Have you made your decision? Lauren... please. I wanna do the right thing. - I really do. - But? But how do I know that you're telling the truth? I showed you the body. The truth about vanishing. I have been imprisoned in this room for longer than you have been alive. If I walk out that door, I will never, ever look back. I have your word? I swear. Clean up. You're leaving tonight. - Why are we meeting here? - We have a situation. - What happened? - My father happened. I told you, Sofia isn't a concern. And that other issue... I need you to set up a Cayman Islands account. You're good at that. Put my one million in it, and I need 100K in cash. Who's this for? A man my dad wronged. In addition, I need an ID, fake or otherwise, and I need to charter a jet to fly him there. Make sure none of this is traceable back to us. Hey, hold on, hold on. I've done plenty of shady things in my life, but I always knew the reason. Give me a reason. You don't wanna know. On a scale of one to 10. Apocalyptic. Who else knows about this? William? Catherine? No one else knows. I need it done ASAP. I have to get this man as far away from us as possible. - What did Archer do... - I can't tell you! I can't tell anyone. Lauren, are you sure you wanna do this? That's a lot of loose ends. I don't have a choice! Call me when it's set. I feel like a new man. You look... different. I will take that as the compliment. I'm sure it was grudgingly meant to be. When you talked, um... what did my dad say about me? What do you mean? Well, you said that you were his confessor, so... so what did he say? He was proud of you. The truth. He thought you should be in the private sector as a litigator, protecting the family interests. A city attorney lacked prestige. Then when you made DA, he thought you were humiliating him by going after his friends. But he loved you... in his way. And he would read me every story when you had some trial in the news. I think after a time, he began to change his mind about things. I thought that I would make him proud if I became DA, but, you know. Least you didn't have to pay off the unions for support. That's a smear campaign. My brother didn't do that. I'm sure Jeffrey Shultz would disagree, if he isn't already lying in a ditch somewhere. Who's Jeffrey Shultz? Can you just keep me updated on the polls as they come through, point-for-point? That'd be great. 1-1/2 cups of finely crushed Graham crackers. Three tablespoons of sugar. One can of sweetened condensed milk. Oh, and I need the most recent draft of my speech within the hour to make the edits. Thank you. One-third of a cup of butter or margarine. Three tablespoons of sugar. One-third of a cup of butter or margarine. Three tablespoons of sugar. One can of sweetened condensed milk. Oh, hey. I'm glad you're here. I wanted to ask you if you... We need to talk. In private. Yeah, okay. Uh, guys, can we get a minute? Thank you. What's wrong? Jeffrey Shultz. Does that name sound familiar? No. Why? Oh, save the bullshit! That article, it's legit, isn't it? You and Dad cut a deal for the votes and used Jeffrey Shultz as the middleman to pay union reps? They can't prove it. Oh, Jesus Christ. What the hell were you thinking? Oh, stop with the choir girl act, Lauren! Don't play dumb. You know how this works. You think anyone gets elected without cutting deals? It's bribery! You and Dad were lying to me. How many? For how long, huh? Why didn't I know? 'Cause you're the district attorney of Manhattan. - I'm your sister! - We were protecting you. Would you really have wanted to know? Honestly. Do you even know the position that would've put you in? I wouldn't have liked it, but I would have protected you. - I am protecting you. - Yeah? Who'd you talk to? - It doesn't matter. - Oh, the hell it doesn't. How do you think you got elected as the DA? Because I can assure you, it wasn't your... Shut up! Don't you dare. Don't you dare ever lie to me again! Are you ready? With every fiber of my being. I can't wait to see the sunrise, feel it on my face. You'll have all the sun you want in the Caymans. It's paradise. Harold, right? He'll help you set up a new life. You can make up for lost time. This might sound a little strange, but, um... this is one of the things that really kept me going. I promised myself that if one day I got free, I'd, um... have myself a slice of key lime pie, like the one in the picture. I'm sorry. You didn't deserve this. You're a good person, Lauren. Thank you. Morgan, just one last thing. If you ever come back, if you ever say a word, I will pin every cold case for the last 30 years on you. I will make you wish you were back in the hole my dad kept you in. Are we clear? - Hey, my name is... - No names. Here are your new IDs, 100,000 in cash and an account number with $1 million. Let's go. Lauren, this is Sanchez. I found that missing person file you needed. Those fingerprints came back with a match. I'm sending it all up to the summer house now. Call me. Thank you, Tom. Lauren? Shit! Shit! Mom? Mom! Mom! Mom, what are you doing? What is this? It's nothing. It's just a work thing. Why do you have pictures of this man? Why are you asking about Morgan? Morgan? This man's name is Carson. No, it's... it's Morgan. That's Morgan! His name is Carson. I... I don't understand. That's... What's going on? Do you know him? Why do you have any of this? This man. This man said his name was Morgan and that Dad's kept this man chained up in a bunker in our backyard! In our backyard, okay? This, this is my fucking inheritance, Mom! This man is evil. He's... He's pure evil. What? Where is he now? Where is he? I... I let him go. I let him go. I... I thought I was doing the right thing. I thought I was doing the right thing, Mom! I called Harold, and I... - Oh, my God. - You lock the doors. I'll handle this. I'll handle it. This is Harold Thewlis. I'm unavailable right now. Please leave a message, and I'll get back to you. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Mom, pick up, pick up. Hey there. You know what to do. Mom, get out of the house now! He's there! He's there, he's there! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom. Mom, can you hear me? Mom, we have to get out of here, Mom. Come on. Mom! Mom, can you hear me? Mom, we have to get out of here. Please, you have to get up. Lauren. Shit. Lauren. Lauren! You would be amazed at how well your eyes and ears adjust after years in near total darkness. I can hear your heartbeat. Thump. Thump. Thump. Thump! 1-1/2 cups of finely crushed Graham crackers. Three tablespoons of sugar. 1-1/2 cup of finely crushed Graham crackers. One-third of a cup of butter or margarine. Three tablespoons of sugar. Hey there, sleepy head. Parting was unbearable. I really didn't wanna start without you, but your mother insisted. I swear to God, I'll tear your heart out. I'm kinda sorry that it's not your dad there in chains. It took me so long to get my hands on him, you know? All my little traps finally worked to perfection. I took some of the poison he got to kill me, I jammed it in his hand when we're playing chess. Checkmate. I got my rat. Then the slippery bastard got away, and I was like, "Oh, fuck!" And just when all hope seemed to be lost... imagine my surprise when you walked in. I knew the moment I saw ya. That little girl takes in stray dogs. She's gonna do the same for me. I just... I just needed to act weak... and helpless. Your brother would've thrown away the key. Hey! Look who it is. Should we invite your mother into this conversation? - Let's do it. - No! - Hey, hey, hey, hey. - No, leave her. Hey, I just wanna say, I really did enjoy our time together, even though it was under false pretenses. Catherine! Can you hear me, sweetheart? No! Get away from her! Get you up. Let's get up. There you go! The floor's cold, come on. This is between you... You and me. That is where you're wrong. You really think your perfect life is built on integrity? You're the monster, Catherine. You just live in a nicer house. Don't you touch her! Okay, okay, okay! We're just getting to the bit where you come in. See, back in the day, your mom, she was a tight little thing. Whoa! Gross. Catherine, tell her about that night. Come on. Tell her all about that special night. You're gonna love this. - Tell her! - Fuck you! Whoa, whoa! That was close. All right, I'll tell her. It was what I used to call my ace in the hole. That night, I wanted the full tour. Oh, come on! Don't you give me that look. I know you wanted it as much as I did. You just didn't want to let yourself have it. You're a rapist. I mean... semantics, you know? You should be dead. I should be dead. I should be a lot of things. Carson, Carson. Why could you not just lie to your husband like a normal fucking wife?! You know, he didn't even give me the chance to talk my way out of it. And then that sound. Eww! It's like hitting a deer, except you can't leave that on the side of the road. That moment, I owned him. And he knew it. "Rich playboy... drunk at the wheel... kills promising young student." Come on! The headlines, they wrote themselves! I was gonna bleed him dry, and there was nothing he could do about it. Almost nothing. Carson! I gotta say... I didn't realize he had it in him. I mean, I am a bad man, but Archer Monroe was the goddamn devil. Truth is, Archer knew that there are some fates that are much worse than death. He needed me to suffer, to rot, to waste away in the dark. He vented, and I listened. He beat me, and I took it. My agony was your daddy's private joy. The thing is, about zookeepers, they always wind up talking to their animals. And over time, things kind of changed. See, I don't think he ever expected me to get out. Whoa! That was a close one. That was a real close one. I should've put a bullet in your head myself. No! Morgan! Revenge! You can't put a price on it, Catherine. Carson. What do you want? I want my pound of flesh. Then let me help you. I'll testify to the truth. I'll expose all the secrets. Everything. Everything my family did. Just let them live. You'd do that for me? Psych! I don't need your help. I don't cut deals. Fine. Then fuck you! I gave you excuses. But I swear you're not walking out of that door alive. I am really, really excited to meet the rest of your family. Especially Claire. I swear to God, if you touch her... You'll what?! You'll beg for mercy? You'll smudge your makeup with tears? Fuck you. You remember that little speech you gave me with the evidence bag? It was very cool. Gave me chills. Here's my counter. I am gonna burn this family's legacy to the ground with the secrets that I know. I am gonna slit your little brother's throat, and I am gonna take a piss on Archer's grave. And you will not be there to experience your family's shame because you and your fucking whore mother will be here, rotting away in the darkness. Now, your body will consume itself. Your sanity will snap. And just before you die your miserable death, you will know exactly what I survived. And your husband and your daughter will spend the rest of their lives wondering why Mommy abandoned them. And... I almost forgot the most important part. When I tell 'em that I... A pathetic lunatic? Yeah, no one's ever gonna believe you. No one ever even looked for you - because you don't matter. - Shut up. Not even to your own father. Shut the hell up! Ow! Goddamn it! You still don't get it, do ya? I'm your goddamn father! You're a Monroe. You understand me? We take care of our own. What'll we do about him? He disappeared 30 years ago.
