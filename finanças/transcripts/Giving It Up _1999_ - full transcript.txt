FOR INSTANCE, SUPERMODEL OF THE MINUTE AMBER. AH. WHAT IS UP WITH THAT? YOU CAN'T WALK 10 FEET IN THIS CITY WITHOUT SEEING SOME RIDICULOUS HOTTIE. AND IF THEY DON'T KNOW YOU, THEY DON'T WANT TO KNOW YOU. RIGHT. IT'S LIKE YOU DON'T EVEN EXIST.

SLIDE SHOW? YOU DON'T NEED A SLIDE SHOW, I NEED A SLIDE SHOW. YOU GET THE WHITE OUT EVERY NIGHT. ACTUALLY, I GOT IT OUT THIS MORNING. THAT BABE FROM THE AWARDS DINNER? YEP. WHY CAN'T I WIN AN AWARD IN FRONT OF 300 HOT WOMEN? WHAT WAS HER NAME, ANYWAYS? ANYONE ACTUALLY GET ANY WORK DONE HERE? ACTUALLY, WE'RE PRETTY MUCH THE HOTTEST SHOP IN TOWN RIGHT NOW. BOOKINGS ARE BIGGER THAN EVER THIS YEAR. NEW ACCOUNTS ARE COMING IN FASTER THAN WE CAN HANDLE THEM. WHICH IS, I'M SURE, WHY THEY BROUGHT YOU IN. IS THAT WHY? I WAS BEGINNING TO WONDER. THE BEST PART IS THERE'S, LIKE, YOUNG HOT GUYS EVERYWHERE. WHAT, ALL THE CREATIVES? HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT? JUST A HUNCH. HMM. IS THIS SUBLIMINAL ADVERTISING? WELL, ACTUALLY, IT'S ONE OF OUR BIGGEST ACCOUNTS. SUBTLE. OHH. I THINK IT STARTED WITH A "D." IT WAS LIKE DEANNA, DIANA, OR DONNA... SO, WHATEVER, SO, LISTEN, I GET THIS BLIND DATE THE OTHER NIGHT, RIGHT? AND THE GIRL THAT SETS ME UP IS, LIKE, A FRIEND OF A FRIEND OF SOMEBODY WHO I DON'T EVEN KNOW. SO, IT'S LIKE A DEAF, DUMB, AND BLIND DATE? RIGHT. AND SO THIS GIRL WHO'S, LIKE, A FULL-ON... JAP, BY THE WAY, I MEAN, TOTAL LONG ISLAND DRAWL AND EVERYTHING, SAYS TO ME, AND I QUOTE, "SHE LOOKS LIKE A MODEL." RIGHT. ALL THE GUYS LOVE HER. YEAH, RIGHT. RIGHT. SO, ANYWAYS, SO, I GO HOME AND, UH, I'M GONNA MEET HER OUT IN FRONT OF MY PLACE, AND I'M RUNNIN' LATE, SO I SHOWER, AND I SHAVE, AND I GET DOWN THERE IN, LIKE, 2 SECONDS. SHE'S NOT THERE? NO, NO, SHE'S THERE. BUT NOT ONLY DOES SHE NOT LOOK LIKE A MODEL, SHE'S GOT, LIKE, HAIR TO THE CEILING. JERSEY. YEAH, RIGHT. SO, THE THING IS, THOUGH, I CAN TELL THAT UNDERNEATH THE BASE, SHE'S KIND OF HOT. YOU KNOW? SO WE GO TO THE RESTAURANT, AND SHE GETS UP, AND SHE HAS TO GO TO THE BATHROOM, AND I TOOK OFF MY JACKET. AND I GUESS--I DON'T KNOW. I GUESS I WAS NERVOUS, AND I DIDN'T PUT ON ANY ANTI-PERSPIRANT OR SOMETHING, BUT MY PITS ARE SOAKED. I MEAN, IT'S, LIKE, NOT EVEN RINGS. IT'S JUST LIKE THESE 2 DARK SHAPES MOVING TOWARDS THE FRONT OF MY CHEST, YOU KNOW. SO I TOTALLY-- I TOTALLY PANIC. AND, UH, NOW, I HAVE TO GET UP, AND I'M IN THE BATHROOM, AND I TURN ON THE LITTLE HAND DRYER, AND I GOTTA POINT IT UP TO DRY OFF MY PITS, SO I CAN-- WAIT. WAIT, HOLD ON. I CAN'T REMEMBER HER FUCKING NAME. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? THE GIRL FROM THE AWARDS DINNER. I DON'T KNOW-- I WAS WITH HER LAST NIGHT, I WAS INSIDE HER AN HOUR AGO, AND NOW I--I CAN'T REMEMBER HER FUCKING NAME. WHY DO YOU CARE? IT'S JUST SO WRONG. I MEAN... I GOTTA MAKE A CHANGE. I CAN'T KEEP GOING OUT WITH THESE NAMELESS WOMEN. OH, DUDE, WHAT ARE YOU-- I GOTTA MOVE ON. "I GOTTA." LISTEN. I'M SERIOUS. YOU CAN'T CHANGE YOUR LIFE. I LOVE YOUR LIFE. DO YOU REALIZE I HAVE A BETTER VICARIOUS SEX LIFE THAN MOST PEOPLE'S REAL LIVES? REALLY! I LOVE YOUR LIFE. YOUR LIFE IS LIKE A GREAT PORNO MOVIE, EXCEPT WITH BETTER LIGHTING. YOU KNOW? AND THERE'S GREAT CHEESY MUSIC AND LOTS OF WOMEN. YOU COULD USE MORE LESBIANS, THOUGH. OH, YOU THINK? YEAH. THANKS FOR THE NOTE. NAH, I GOTTA--MAYBE I JUST HAVEN'T MET THE RIGHT WOMAN YET OR SOMETHING. MAYBE THERE ISN'T THE RIGHT WOMAN. MAYBE I'M JUST AN ASSHOLE. MAYBE YOU JUST LIKE TO GET LAID. I GOT IT! DELIA! THAT WAS HER NAME. DELIA. DELIA. Woman: GOOD MORNING, GALLANT ADVERTISING. GOOD MORNING, PLEASE HOLD. GOOD MORNING, PLEASE HOLD. Second woman: GOOD MORNING, RALPH. Ralph: HEY. WHAT, IS EVERYDAY LIKE SECRETARIES DAY WITH YOU? MORNING, RALPH, I MISSED YOU LAST NIGHT. YEAH... SHE'S JUST A TEMP. OH, GOOD. OH, YUMMIES, GOOD MORNING. YUM, YUM. NO, IT'S YUMMIES. IT'S MY OWN NEW SAYING. IT'S LIKE YUPPIES. YEAH, BUT YUPPIES IS YOUNG URBAN PROFESSIONALS. HOW IS YUPPIES LIKE YUMMIES? IT'S BETTER. IT'S YOUNG URBAN MODELS. YUMMIES. NOT ONLY IS IT AN ACRONYM, BUT IT'S ALSO AN ONOMATOPOEIA. OH, 'CAUSE THEY'RE...YUMMY. YUMMY. RIGHT, THAT'S WHY I'M SO TICKLED. AHEM. GUYS, THIS IS OUR NEW ACCOUNT DIRECTOR, ELIZABETH BRENNER. PETER McGRATH, ONE OF OUR COPYWRITERS. AND OUR NEW ASSOCIATE CREATIVE DIRECTOR, RALPH GAGANTE. HI. HI. ALL RIGHT. PITCH MODE, PEOPLE. SPARTAN CONDOM CAMPAIGN. OK, KID, BRING US UP TO SPEED. ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO. A TEEN COUPLE, ABOUT 14 YEARS OLD, ABOUT TO GET DOWN. AW, YEAH. BLACK AND WHITE, EXTREME CLOSE-UPS AND QUICK JARRING CUTS. NO DIALOGUE AT ALL. HE RIPS OPEN HER BLOUSE. WHOO! THE BUTTONS SCATTER IN SLOW MOTION. SHE FUMBLES CLUMSILY WITH THE BUTTON AT HIS NECK, GETS FRUSTRATED, GRABS IT WITH HER TEETH, SPITS IT OUT. PTOO! CUT BACK, THEY'RE DOWN TO THEIR UNDERWEAR. HE MOVES TOWARDS HER. SHE STOPS HIM. HER LOOK SAYS IT ALL. NO GLOVE, NO LOVE. UH-UH. BUT HE PLEADS WITH HER. "COME ON, IT'S SO MUCH BETTER WITHOUT A CONDOM." SHE'S NOT GOING FOR IT. SO HE REACHES INTO THE BACK OF HIS POCKET, PULLS OUT THE GENERICALLY PACKAGED CONDOM. BUT HE CAN'T OPEN IT. IT JUST WON'T TEAR. HE'S TRYING, SHE'S RIDING UP ON HIM, GETTING IMPATIENT. "COME ON, BABY." SO, SHE REACHES INTO HER BAG AND PULLS OUT... THE PRODUCT. ♪ BOM-CHIK-A BOM-BOM ♪ SHE OPENS IT, THE CONDOM SPILLS OUT. HE SMILES, RELIEVED. DISSOLVE THROUGH THIS ECSTATIC SHOT OF THEM REACHING BLISSFUL SATISFACTION TOGETHER. ♪ BA-BOM-BOM VOICE OVER: "THE SAFE CASE FROM SPARTAN. "WE'VE BEEN AROUND FOR 30 YEARS, WE WANT YOU TO BE AROUND A LOT LONGER." THAT'S A GREAT JOB, KID. OK, NOTES. Elizabeth: YEAH, I'VE GOT NOTES. I LIKE THE TAGLINE, BUT IS ANYBODY NEEDING CHILD PORNOGRAPHY MASKING AS AVANT-GARDE FILM? DID YOU--DID YOU ACTUALLY DRAW IN THAT WOMAN'S NIPPLE? YUP. YOU CANNOT SHOW A NIPPLE ON TELEVISION. FOX WILL RUN IT. THEY RUN ANYTHING. LEGAL WON'T CLEAR IT. DID YOU LOOK AT THAT NIPPLE? THAT'S A GREAT NIPPLE. THE NETWORKS ARE DEFINITELY NOT GOING TO LET YOU SHOW THEM COMING TOGETHER. THEY'RE NOT COMING TOGETHER. THEY'RE COMING TOGETHER. ISN'T THIS WHAT MADE US SUCCESSFUL IN THE FIRST PLACE? HIGH-IMPACT CREATIVE. IN-YOUR-FACE, DOWN-YOUR-THROAT, UP-YOUR-BAD-ASS ADVERTISING. WE'RE SELLING SAFE SEX, NOT EROTICA. THESE SUITS ALWAYS MISS THE POINT. WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO SAY IS THAT SAFE SEX CAN BE EROTIC... ALL EVIDENCE TO THE CONTRARY. THE CLIMAX, THE SEX, ELIZABETH, IS WHAT SELLS THE PRODUCT. I THINK THE CLIENT WOULD LIKE TO TARGET A MORE SOPHISTICATED DEMOGRAPHIC. WITH THIS, YOU'RE ALIENATING EVERYBODY BUT TEENAGE KIDS. AND WAIT, I WAS RIGHT. THAT'S PORNO MUSIC. NO, IT'S FROMSHAFT. ACTUALLY, THAT WAS FROM CAR WASH. IT'S ISAAC HAYES, MAN. BLACK MOSES. NO, AT THE END. THE GUY COMES IN IN THE CADDY. IT'S DIRTY. HE WANTS IT CLEAN. I REMEMBER THAT. I LOVE THAT SCENE. HE GETS A VERY CLEAN CAR AT THE END. MY MOM'S GOT HIS GREATEST HITS AT HER HOUSE. ACTUALLY, GUYS, THAT WAS DEBBIE DOES DALLAS. Man: WAIT A MINUTE, FOLKS. WHAT WE NEED HERE IS A LITTLE SYNERGY, NOT ANARCHY. NOW, THIS CLIENT IS A-LIST. THEY PLAY ROCKETBALL. SO, WE'LL LOSE THE CLIMAX, KID, BUT WE'LL SAVE THE NIPPLE SHOT. AS FAR AS THE CENSORS ARE CONCERNED, I'M SURE THAT... YOU'LL FIND A WAY TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN, LIZ. ELIZABETH. ELIZABETH. OK? I'M OFF TO THE COAST, WHERE THEY'RE GOING A LITTLE BALLISTIC. SO, UH, YOU GUYS NOODLE THIS AND THEN LAY IT ON ME ON FRIDAY AT THE GANGBANG. OK? CIAO BELLA! [WHISPERING] Ciao. Ciao. SEE YOU LATER, MAN. LATER, DUDE. UH, ELIZABETH? RALPH. I TAKE IT YOU'RE NOT A BIG FAN OF MY WORK. IT'S NOT THAT, RALPH. IT'S JUST, DON'T YOU THINK WE'RE SORT OF TAKING THE LOW ROAD HERE? YES, I HEARD WHAT YOU SAID IN THE MEETING. BUT, UH, YOU KNOW, SEX SELLS, ELIZABETH. IT'S SOMETHING EVERYBODY FEELS ENTITLED TO. IT'S NOT THE SEX I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH, RALPH. IT'S HOW YOU USE THE SEX. WELL, HOW DO YOU EXPECT ME TO SELL CONDOMS WITHOUT USING SEX? YOU'RE THE CREATIVE HERE. CREATE! WHAT? UH, YOU'RE INCREDIBLE. YOU'RE JUST SO, UH, PASSIONATE AND, LIKE, INTELLIGENT. OH, PLEASE. NO, NO, I'M SERIOUS. I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT. EVERY SURVEY THEY TAKE TELLS ME, "SELL SEX. SEX SELLS. SELLING IS SEXY." SO... AND THE NIPPLE SHOT? THAT'S A PERSONAL THING. SO YOU-- WHAT DO YOU MEAN, IT'S A PERSONAL THING? YOU KNOW, LIKE A FETISH. FETISH? OH, LIKE, UH, LIKE THE SMALL OF A WOMAN'S BACK. OR THE SPACE JUST BEHIND HER SHOULDER BLADE. OR THAT LITTLE SPOT RIGHT BEHIND HER EAR. OK, I GET IT. I GOT THE POINT. THESE ARE THE THINGS THAT TURN PEOPLE ON. YOU KNOW? I'M BEING HONEST HERE. YOU'VE GOT SOME LINE, GAGANTE. I MEAN, YOU REALLY ARE CONVINCED THAT EVERY WOMAN WANTS TO SLEEP WITH YOU. NOT EVERY WOMAN, BUT A LOT. CAN I TAKE YOU OUT TO DINNER? BEST ITALIAN IN NEW YORK. NO, NO. WE CAN TALK ABOUT WORK. YEAH, I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR WHAT YOU SO-CALLED CREATIVES ACTUALLY DO. GREAT. GREAT. I'LL, UH, PICK YOU UP AROUND 7:00? OH. OH, WAIT, I CAN'T. I'VE GOT A DATE. RIGHT. SHE'S GOT A DATE. Ralph: JEANS, JEANS, JEANS... I LOVE MY JEANS. MY JEANS ARE SO HOT. WHAT AM I DOING HERE THIS LATE? GOD, I SHOULD BE OUT WITH SOMEONE. THEY DON'T PAY ME ENOUGH FOR THIS. WELL, YEAH, THEY DO. GOD, IT'S HOT. OK. [SNIFFING] [MOANING] OH, YEAH. YEAH, THAT'S IT. SURE. I'D GIVE THE SHIRT... OFF MY BACK... FOR JEANS... THAT FIT. AMBER. Amber: I'D TAKE OFF MY JEANS FOR YOU, RALPH.

UNFORTUNATELY, AS YOU CAN SEE, THEY'RE NOT EXACTLY COMING IN IN DROVES. AS IT STANDS, I CAN'T EVEN TURN ON THE NEON LIGHTS, MUCH LESS THE KARAOKE MACHINE. WHAT'S THE PROBLEM? WELL, I GOT THIS PLACE IN A FORECLOSURE, BUT IT COST ME EVERYTHING I HAD. AND NOW I'VE GOT THIS HUGE OVERHEAD WITH NO BASE CLIENTELE. SEE, THE PREVIOUS OWNER JACKED THE PRICES UP SO HIGH, IT SCARED A LOT OF THE PARENTS OFF. SO, WHAT DID YOU HAVE IN MIND? WELL, I JUST NEED TO GET THE WORD OUT TO PEOPLE WHO COULDN'T AFFORD TO BRING THEIR KIDS HERE BEFORE. SO, TARGET A MULTI-ETHNIC CROSS-SECTION? MAYBE CREATE, LIKE, A BLOCK PARTY IMAGE? YEAH, YEAH, THAT'S GOOD. WELL, LET'S SEE WHAT WE HAVE TO WORK WITH. OK. HAVE YOU HAD A CHANCE TO PUT TOGETHER AN ADVERTISING BUDGET? THAT'S PRETTY MUCH WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT ON THE PHONE. YOU HAVE NO BUDGET. I HAVE NO BUDGET. THAT'S OK. BASICALLY, WE'RE LOOKING AT, UM, AT, UH, AIRTIME AND PRODUCTION COSTS, WHICH IS REALLY GONNA BE THE MAIN DRAG. WHOA! HEY! OH, YOU WANT TO PLAY NOW, LOVER? WE'LL FINISH THIS UP LATER? ALL RIGHT. OK, THANKS. SORRY. SHE'S SOME LADY. ARE YOU TWO, UH... OH, NO. WHY DO YOU ASK? I DON'T KNOW. JUST A THOUGHT. YEAH. NO, NO.

GREAT. GREAT. PROBLEM IS, HE'S GOT NO MONEY. HMM...FUCK HIM. RIGHT. WE COULD DO THAT. BUT I WAS THINKING MAYBE WE DO IT PRO BONO. PRO BONO? BALK, BALK, BALK. THAT'S ME BALKING. PRO BONO, WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? I COULD DO IT--I COULD DO SOME WORK IN MY FREE TIME. WHAT FREE TIME? YOU'RE BANGING SECRETARIES TWICE A DAY. YOU NAIL THAT ONE YET, BY THE WAY? NO, NO. SHE'S NOT REALLY MY TYPE. WHY NOT? SHE'S HUMANOID. SHE'S A LITTLE BOOKISH. AH. SORRY, I CAN COME BACK LATER. NO, NO, NO. LIZ, PLEASE SIT DOWN. YOU OF ALL PEOPLE SHOULD HEAR THIS GAME PLAN. MR. DON JUAN GANDHI WANTS TO WORK PRO BONO FOR THE WONDER CAMP. WANTS TO DO THE CREATIVE WORK IN HIS FREE TIME. SO, MAHATMA, TELL US WHO YOU PLAN ON SCREWING TO CRUNCH THE NUMBERS. WHAT? HEY... ACTUALLY, JONATHAN, THAT'S NOT GOING TO BE NECESSARY. I'VE BEEN CRUNCHING THE NUMBERS, AND I THINK THAT HE CAN AFFORD THE AIRTIME AND PRODUCTION COSTS IF WE CAN PROVIDE THE CREATIVE WORK IN NUMBERS. AH. ANOTHER ALTRUIST. JONATHAN, THIS GUY IS REALLY TRYING TO DO SOMETHING HERE. I MEAN, WONDER CAMP IS A SAFE AND CREATIVE PLACE FOR THESE KIDS TO PLAY. WITHOUT IT, THEY HAVE NOTHING. SO? YOU KNOW, JONATHAN, WE DO HAVE SOME CONTACTS AT AD AGE. THEY MIGHT LIKE A COVER STORY ABOUT AN AD EXEC WHO WANTS TO GIVE BACK TO THE COMMUNITY. DONE. BUT I WANT BIG-TIME P.R. ON THIS. I WANT TO MILK THIS BABY FOR ALL IT'S WORTH, OK? AND DON'T DROP THE BALL ON THIS ONE, KIDDIES, BECAUSE BIG BROTHER WILL BE WATCHING. Ralph: I WANT TO USE WHAT HAPPENED AT WONDER CAMP IN THE AD, YOU KNOW? SOMETHING ABOUT HOW THE KIDS WERE WORKING TOGETHER. TEAMWORK. "TEAM WONDER CAMP." UM, I DON'T KNOW. "FOR PARENTS WHO TRAVEL," YOU KNOW, "WHETHER AT WORK OR PLAY, YOUR KIDS WILL BE LOVED ALL DAY." THAT SUCKS. THAT SUCKS. OK. UM. SOMETHING ABOUT WONDER CAMP. YOU KNOW, THE WORD "WONDER." I DON'T KNOW, THERE'S 7 WONDERS OF THE WORLD. THIS COULD BE THE EIGHTH WONDER. "WONDER CAMP, THE EIGHTH WONDER OF THE WORLD." HEY, THAT'S GOOD. I LIKE THAT. JOSEPH WILL LOVE THAT. WE CAN GET SHOTS OF THE GREAT WALL OF CHINA. WE CAN GET AN EXPENSE-PAID TRIP. SO, WE'LL JUST-- WHOA. WHOA. I THINK, GIVEN THE BUDGET CONSTRAINTS, WE MIGHT WANT TO KEEP IT SIMPLE. WE HAVE TO USE WHAT WE HAVE ACCESS TO. I MEAN, WE HAVE THE SPACE, WHICH IS GREAT. UM, WE HAVE JOSEPH. WE COULD USE HIS ASSISTANT IN THE SHOT. SOMETHING LIKE HER WITH ONE OF THE KIDS. WAIT, HERE. CHECK THIS OUT. YOU ARE REALLY NOT WELL. WHAT? WELL, WHERE'S THE NIPPLE, RALPH? UH, TH-THERE'S NO NIPPLE. THIS SPOT IS FOR A PLAYGROUND FOR CHILDREN. YOU CAN'T USE SEX TO SELL THAT. IT'S NOT SO MUCH SEX AS IT IS AESTHETICS. YOU KNOW, PEOPLE LIKE LOOKING AT ATTRACTIVE PEOPLE IN ATTRACTIVE SETTINGS WEARING ATTRACTIVE CLOTHES. IT--IT ATTRACTS THEM. HENCE, YOUR $1,200 SUITS, YOUR PERFECTLY MUSSED-UP HAIR, THE FERRARI. GIVE ME A BREAK. YOU MAKE IT SOUND LIKE I'M SOME KIND OF MALE MODEL WANNABE. FACE IT, RALPH, EVERYTHING YOU DO, SAY, OR WEAR IS SHREWDLY CALCULATED TO ATTRACT MEMBERS OF THE OPPOSITE SEX. EVERYTHING EVERYBODY DOES IS. YEAH, BUT FOR YOU IT'S, LIKE, THE CENTRAL ACTIVITY OF YOUR LIFE, RIGHT? SOMEHOW I SUSPECT IT'S ALWAYS BEEN THAT WAY. WELL, YEAH. AS FAR BACK AS I CAN REMEMBER. Man: HEY, TERESA, GET BACK IN THE HOUSE BEFORE I SMACK YOU ALL THE WAY BACK TO BAY RIDGE, HUH. FUCK YOU, VINNY, YOU...PIGFUCKER! HEY, DON'T YOU RAISE YOUR VOICE TO ME! Ralph: I GREW UP IN BROOKLYN, WHICH COULD BE THE SOURCE OF ALL MY PROBLEMS RIGHT THERE. SEE, MY MOTHER'S JEWISH, AND MY FATHER'S ITALIAN, WHICH, I GUESS, SORT OF MAKES ME A PIZZA BAGEL. ANYWAY, JEWS AND ITALIANS ARE VERY SIMILAR. OF COURSE, YOU'LL NEVER HEAR ANY ITALIAN SAYING THAT. BOTH HAVE GENEROUS TRADITIONS OF GUILT. CATHOLIC GUILT, WHICH FOCUSES MOSTLY ON SEX, AND JEWISH GUILT, WHICH DEALS MAINLY IN FOOD. Woman: MARLENE, LITTLE RALPHIE WON'T EAT VEGETABLES? A BILLION CHINAMEN ARE STARVING, AND THIS MESHUGGENEH SAYS HE DOESN'T LIKE ANYTHING GREEN! Ralph: MY FATHER'S SIDE OF THE FAMILY IS HUGE BECAUSE HE HAD 5 SISTERS WHO ALL HAD CHILDREN, WHICH MADE FOR LOTS OF COUSINS, AND LOTS OF BIRTHDAYS, AND HOLIDAYS, AND SUNDAYS. GOOD OLD DAYS. I USED TO BE LIKE THIS TO THE UNDERBOSS OF THE GAMBINO FAMILY. HE'S THE GUY WHO MADE BIG PAUL. SHUT THE HELL UP, TOMMY! YOU'RE ABOUT AS CONNECTED AS A PHONE WITH AN UNPAID BILL! OH, YOU'RE A LIAR! YOU ALWAYS HAVE BEEN A LIAR! LITTLE RALPHIE, WOMEN ARE THE DOWNFALL OF ALL MEN IN THIS WORLD. LITTLE RALPH, GET YOUR HAND OUT OF YOUR TROUSERS! WHAT, HE SHOULD BE DIFFERENT FROM ALL THE OTHER MEN IN THE FAMILY? [KNOCKING] WHAT TOOK YOU SO LONG? YOU'RE THE ONE WANTED TO DO THIS. LET'S HURRY, BEFORE SOMEONE CATCHES US. OK, YOU FIRST. NO, YOU. ♪ I MUST BE GETTING ON ♪ I'VE GOT TO GO CROSS-TOWN ♪ TOWARDS THE SEAGULL SOUND AND THE FREIGHTERS ♪ ♪ I MUST MEET THE ALLIGATOR ♪ SO, I SAID, ALL RIGHT, MAN ♪ WHATEVER YOU SAY ♪ AND I WAS ON MY WAY "M&Ms MAKE FRIENDS," HUH? TAGLINE OF THE CENTURY. YOU'RE REALLY NOT WELL. OK, ENOUGH ABOUT ME FOR A WHILE. UH-OH. TELL ME ABOUT YOUR FIRST SEXUAL EXPERIENCE. WELL, OK. I MET THIS GUY FRESHMAN YEAR AT ORIENTATION. AND, UM, WE TOOK THIS HIKING CLASS TOGETHER. IT WAS ONE OF THOSE ONE-CREDIT DEALS, YOU KNOW?

ANYWAY, UM, SO WE ENDED UP SHARING A TENT AND... SO, WERE YOU GUYS FRIENDS AFTERWARDS? WELL, ACTUALLY, WE WENT OUT FOR 3 YEARS. WHOA. AND WHAT HAPPENED? I DON'T KNOW. I GUESS WE JUST GREW IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS. BUT, UM, WE STILL TALK. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? YOU'RE JUST, LIKE, FRIENDS? LIKE, HEY, BUDDY? WHAT, YOU DON'T HAVE ANY FRIENDS THAT ARE WOMEN? NO, I DO. IT'S-- BUT I STILL SLEEP WITH THEM. WELL, WOULDN'T IT BE NICE JUST TO HANG OUT WITH A WOMAN WITHOUT THE SPECTER OF SEX HANGING OVER YOUR HEADS ALL THE TIME? IT IS NICE. THE ADVOCATE, HUH? THAT'S A GREAT MAGAZINE. YOU A DYKE? UH... A GAY WOMAN. ARE YOU ONE? 'CAUSE YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY NOT A GAY MAN. THAT'S TRUE. NO, I'M A WRITER. YOU WRITE FOR THE ADVOCATE? NO, I WRITE FOR MYSELF. THEN WHAT THE HELL DO YOU KNOW ABOUT A MAGAZINE FOR GAY MEN AND WOMEN? WELL, ACTUALLY, I'M IN ADVERTISING. AND WE DEAL WITH A LOT OF MAGAZINES. OH, YOU'RE AN IMAGE MAKER. YOU SHOULD PROBABLY CONSIDER KILLING YOURSELF. IF YOU'RE NICE, I MIGHT PUT YOU IN ONE OF MY ADS. GREAT. I THOUGHT YOU SAID YOU WERE A WRITER. UH, SORT OF. THINKING ABOUT BECOMING ONE. YOU A DYKE? SORT OF. I'M THINKING ABOUT BECOMING ONE. I NEVER THOUGHT OF SEXUAL ORIENTATION AS A MAYBE, KIND OF, SORT OF THING. YEAH, WELL, I'M DEFINITELY CHANGING SOMETHING. WELL, HOW ABOUT SOMETHING NORMAL, LIKE YOUR OVERALLS-- I THINK I'M GONNA CHANGE MY NAME. TO WHAT? REX. REX WHAT? NO, JUST REX. YEAH. UH, WELL, I THINK MAYBE YOU SHOULD START WITH SOMETHING A LITTLE MORE LOW-KEY, LIKE YOUR HAIRSTYLE. ACTUALLY, I WAS THINKING ABOUT SHAVING IT OFF. REX IT IS. I THINK YOU SHOULD STICK WITH REX. YOU THINK SO? YEAH. DO YOU WANT TO GO TAKE A WALK OR SOMETHING? WITH YOU? NO, JUST DID YOU WANT TO GO WALKING... [LAUGHS] YEAH, WITH ME. UH, I HAVEN'T FINISHED MY COFFEE. SO...

RALPH, YOU DON'T HAVE TO GET SO DEFENSIVE. I WAS ONLY KIDDING. WELL, I'M NOT BEING DEFENSIVE. IT'S JUST THAT YOU'RE ALWAYS JUDGING ME... SAYING "YOU'RE REALLY NOT WELL." YOU KNOW, EVERYTHING IS FINE. LOOK AT ME. LAST NIGHT, I CONVERTED A LESBIAN TO HETEROSEXUALITY. MY LIFE IS SICK. I'M SORRY. I DIDN'T MEAN TO UPSET YOU. I-- NO, IT'S-- FORGET IT. I'M SORRY. LET'S GO BACK TO WORK. DID YOU, UH, GET THOSE FIGURES ON THE-- UM... WONDER CAMP THING? YOU'RE RIGHT. I'M A SICK... SICK BASTARD. RALPH... ARE YOU OK? I MEAN, IF YOU'RE NOT COMFORTABLE TALKING TO ME, THEN MAYBE YOU SHOULD THINK ABOUT TALKING TO SOMEBODY ELSE. WHAT, LIKE A SHRINK? THANK YOU VERY MUCH, BUT I DON'T BELIEVE IN THAT CRAP. [SIGHS] [WHISPERING] Oh, man. WHAT WOULD A-- WHAT WOULD A MAN'S MAN DO? YOU KNOW, WHAT WOULD GARY COOPER DO? THE COOP WOKE UP IN THE MORNING, HE LOOKED IN THE MIRROR, HE KNEW EXACTLY WHO HE WAS LOOKING AT, YOU KNOW? NONE OF THIS, "WHERE AM I, "WHAT AM I DOING? I'M SO NOT SATISFIED IN MY JOB" NINETIES PSYCHOBABBLE. [SIGHS] HERE'S A GUY WHO WOKE UP IN THE MORNING AND SHAVED WITH ONE OF THEM HORSEHAIR BRUSHES AND A STRAIGHT-EDGE RAZOR AND DIDN'T EVEN FLINCH. NONE OF THOSE TOILET PAPER BLOOD CLOTS ON HIS NECK WHEN HE WENT OUT TO GET THE BAD GUYS. JUST A SURENESS OF PURPOSE THAT CAME FROM KNOWING WHO HE WAS. HOW DOES THAT MAKE YOU...FEEL? HA HA.

I WRITE EVERYTHING DOWN. SMOKE? NO. GIRLS DON'T LIKE IT. UH, I DON'T SMOKE. OH. SO, WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU? UH...WELL... I LEAD A VERY PROMISCUOUS SEXUAL LIFE, AND A FRIEND OF MINE, I WAS TELLING HER HOW GREAT MY LIFE IS, HOW I HAVE ALL THESE GREAT CLOTHES AND A GREAT CAR AND A GREAT LIFE. AND WHILE I WAS TELLING HER, I WAS... DEPRESSED... TO SAY THE LEAST. SO SHE SAID MAYBE YOU SHOULD GO TALK TO SOMEBODY. SO HERE I AM, SEEING IF MAYBE YOU CAN HELP ME. HOW OLD ARE YOU, MR. GIGANT-EY? 27. AND HOW MANY WOMEN WOULD YOU ESTIMATE YOU'VE HAD SEXUAL RELATIONS WITH IN YOUR LIFE? UH... I DON'T KNOW. HUNDREDS. WHAT DO YOU WANT THAT YOU DON'T HAVE? I HAVE SEX ALL THE TIME WITH THESE WOMEN, THESE WOMEN WHOSE NAMES I DON'T KNOW. AND WHAT I REALLY WANT FROM LIFE IS A--IS A WOMAN WHO'S GONNA LOVE ME, TO START A FAMILY, TO HAVE KIDS. AND I CAN'T SEE THAT HAPPENING LIVING THE WAY I AM. WHY, ARE YOU MISERABLE NOW? YEAH, I'M MISERABLE. YOU SUICIDAL? UH, NO. ARE YOU AWARE OF A CLINICAL TERM "SATYRIASIS?" SOUNDS LIKE A SKIN DISEASE. FORESKIN, MAYBE. HEH. WHAT ARE YOU LAUGHING AT? DO YOU FEEL THAT THIS SEXUAL COMPULSION OF YOURS, UM... INTERFERES WITH YOUR WORK LIFE? I GET LAID AT NIGHT, AND I TAKE THE EXPERIENCE I HAD AND I TRANSLATE IT INTO SOME KIND OF ADVERTISEMENT. AND, UH, I DON'T KNOW... SEX SELLS. IN OTHER WORDS, YOU'VE LEARNED HOW TO... SUBLIMATE. WE CALL IT, UH, SUBLIMINAL ADVERTISING. BUT YOU MEAN LIKE FREUDIAN SLIPS OR-- THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS A FREUDIAN SLIP. IT'S YOUR CAPACITY TO SUBLIMATE THAT HAS MADE YOU SO SUCC-SEXUAL. SUCCESSFUL? THAT'S WHAT I SAID. YOU'RE A SCARY MAN. THIS SESSION HAS COME TO A CONCLUSION, MR. GIGANT-EY. NO, NO, WHAT DO YOU MEAN? I WOULD SUGGEST THAT YOU GO OUTSIDE AND MAKE AN APPOINTMENT WITH MY RECEPTIONIST TO COME IN IN A COUPLE OF DAYS AND LIE ON THE COUCH. Elizabeth: DATING WITHIN THE BUSINESS IS DEFINITELY A CAREER NO-NO. THEY WON'T TAKE YOU SERIOUSLY. WELL, I KNOW THAT. BUT HOW THE HELL ELSE AM I GONNA MEET GUYS WITH ANY KIND OF MONEY IN THEIR POCKETS? I DON'T HAVE TIME TO USE MY VIBRATOR... [LAUGHS] MUCH LESS, YOU KNOW, GO OUT TROLLING. MMM.

I HAD SEX WITH THEM. ALL A MAN HAD TO DO WAS... GIVE ME A SMILE OR AN INTERESTED LOOK, AND I WOULD TAKE HIM BACK TO MY APARTMENT AND HAVE SEX WITH HIM IMMEDIATELY. OF COURSE, I FELT SHAMEFUL ABOUT IT AFTERWARDS, SO TO EASE THE GUILT I WOULD SEEK OUT ANOTHER SEXUAL EXPERIENCE. THERE WERE DAYS WHEN I WOULD HAVE INTERCOURSE, ORAL AND ANAL SEX, WITH 5 OR 6 DIFFERENT GUYS. AND THEN, WELL THEN I'D MASTURBATE MYSELF TO SLEEP. I WANT TO FUCK YOU SO HARD RIGHT NOW.

I HAPPEN TO BE VERY GOOD AT IT. WAIT, WAIT, WAIT. YOU KNOW HOW PETER'S ALWAYS QUOTING VOGUE AND BAZAAR AND ALL THOSE MAGAZINES? I SAW THIS BACK ISSUE IN HIS BATHROOM, AND IT'S FOLDED BACK TO THIS ARTICLE CALLED, "HEAD GAMES: SHOW HIM HOW TO DO IT, AND YOU BOTH WIN." I FELT REALLY BAD FOR HIM ESPECIALLY SINCE HE HAS ABSOLUTELY NO EXPERIENCE WITH WOMEN. BETTER NO EXPERIENCE THAN THE ENTIRE METROPOLITAN AREA. AND WHAT IS THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN? RALPH. OH, YOU'VE GOT THAT BOY ON THE BRAIN, GIRLFRIEND. YEAH. OH. SO, YOU LIKE HIM? PRETTY STUPID, HUH? WHY? BECAUSE OF THE WHOLE THING WITH WOMEN? LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING. ALL MEN HAVE THAT THING WITH WOMEN. OH, YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M SORRY. I JUST... I DON'T BUY THAT. THERE MUST BE SOMETHING ABOUT HIM. HE'S OBVIOUSLY ON YOUR MIND. [SIGHS] I CAN'T TAKE THIS ANY MORE, MAN. I'VE BEEN CELIBATE FOR I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG. YOU NEED TO GET LAID. LIKE, A LOT. HE'S RIGHT. GET THIS OUT OF YOUR SYSTEM. YOU SHOULD HAVE AS MUCH SEX IN AS SHORT A PERIOD OF TIME AS YOU POSSIBLY CAN. IT'D BE TOUGH FOR YOU TO BREAK YOUR OWN RECORD. BUT I THINK YOU SHOULD TRY. YOU GOTTA GET OUT OF THIS CELIBATE MODE. FIND YOURSELF A WILLING HONEY TO RELEASE ALL THIS STRESS INTO. OR ONTO. AS THE CASE MAY BE. NO, I--I CAN'T EVEN LOOK AT OTHER WOMEN. YOU'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT ELIZABETH, HUH? WHY DO YOU SPEAK? WHAT DID I SAY? NO, IT'S OK. PETER'S RIGHT. I THINK ABOUT ELIZABETH ALL THE TIME. THEN CALL HER, MAN. I'M SURE SHE'LL TAKE YOU BACK. SHE WOULDN'T TAKE ME BACK. SHE HATES ME. SHE HATES MY WORK. SHE THINKS I'M A SUPERFICIAL, MISOGYNISTIC, CHAUVINISTIC, PHILANDERING PIG. YOU ARE. YOU WERE. THANKS. IT HAS, LIKE, UM, THIS BIG ROMANTIC ENDING, RIGHT?

NATURAL AFFECTION FOR WOMEN. WELL, THAT'S EXACTLY IT, RIGHT? THAT IS EXACTLY THE BEST AND THE WORST THING ABOUT HIM. WELL, HONEY, YOU COULD GIVE HIM THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT. WELL, I TRIED. BUT?

ANDRE, CAN YOU, UM, WAIT RIGHT HERE FOR A SECOND? I'LL BE RIGHT BACK. CERTAINLY, ELLE. I WILL BE ANXIOUSLY AWAITING YOUR RETURN. CAN I GET YOU SOMETHING? [NEW YORK ACCENT] YEAH, I'LL TAKE A BUD. PETER, HI. ELIZABETH. HEY, WHAT'S UP? NOTHING. HOW YOU DOING? GOOD. GOOD. HEY, UH, CAN I MEET YOU AT THE RESTAURANT? YEAH, SURE. OK. GREAT. HEY, CAN YOU GET ME AN ICE WATER? ONE OF THE TALL GLASSES, NOT THE SMALL ONES. WELL, YOU LOOK GREAT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. YOU KNOW, RALPH TOTALLY SET ME UP. HE TALKED GALLANT INTO GIVING ME HIS OLD JOB. WELL, THAT'S GREAT. YEAH. YEAH, HOW ABOUT YOU? WHAT ARE YOU UP TO? ACTUALLY, I'M WORKING AT A SMALLER BOUTIQUE AGENCY RIGHT BY THE OFFICE. IT'S, UH... GIVES ME A LITTLE MORE FREEDOM. YOU KNOW? SO, UM... HOW IS RALPH? IS HE... GOOD. GOOD. YEAH? YEAH, HE'S GOOD. GOOD. GOOD. YEAH. WHAT'S HE UP TO? HE IS UP TO SOME OF HIS OWN STUFF. WORKING ON HIS OWN. OK. YEAH. WELL, ACTUALLY, I SHOULD PROBABLY GET GOING. YEAH, ME, TOO. OK.

OH, MY GOD. WHY DO I WANT EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THESE WOMEN?! KID... IT'S A SNATCH-22. YOU LOVE WOMEN, AND THEY HATE YOU FOR IT. HONEY, IF YOU WERE A WOMAN, YOU'D BE CALLED A NYMPHOMANIAC. AW, YEAH. I THINK IT HAS TO DO WITH DOWN INSIDE EVERY WOMAN THERE IS, LIKE, THIS PSYCHOLOGICAL BASEMENT AREA. EVERY MAN WANTS THE PERFECT WOMAN. IT'S LIKE A BOX, AND INSIDE OF IT ARE A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT WE WANT, LIKE A BIKE OR A MITT. MEN ARE ALWAYS LOOKING FOR SOMETHING BETTER. WE'RE TRYING TO GET DOWN INTO THE BASEMENT. WHO'S DOWN THERE? WHY IS IT SO DARK AND COLD? IT'S HUMAN NATURE. GUYS JUST WANT TO SPREAD THEIR SEED. WOMEN STILL REMEMBER THE FIRST KISS AFTER MEN HAVE FORGOTTEN THE LAST. IT'S ALL ABOUT PROPAGATING THE SPECIES. IF YOU WEREN'T OUT BALLIN' SO MUCH, THE HUMAN RACE AS WE KNOW IT WOULD BE FINISHED. EVERY WOMAN HAS SOMETHING DIFFERENT TO OFFER. SHORT WOMEN, TALL WOMEN, FAT WOMEN, DUMB WOMEN, BRIGHT WOMEN, QUICK WOMEN, SLUGGISH WOMEN. THEY'RE ALL DIFFERENT. THEY'RE ALL SPECIAL. THEY'RE ALL UNIQUE. THEY ALL INSPIRE. Grandma: LISTEN, RALPHIE, YOU WILL ALWAYS BE ATTRACTED TO MANY WOMEN. YOU JUST HAVE TO FIND ONE WOMAN WHO YOU LOVE. AND TO BETRAY HER WOULD DESTROY YOU. RESPECT. MENSCHKEIT! FALLING IN LOVE. THAT'S THE ANSWER? IT ALWAYS WAS, AND IT ALWAYS WILL BE. THINK ABOUT IT. OH! GOOD-BYE, RALPHIE. THANKS, GRANDMA. "AND WHAT WILL HAPPEN? WHAT DO YOU THINK? WHEN CREAM... THROUGH THE SCREEN GIVES PEACHES A WINK." WHAT? HOW? A CAT NAMED PEACHES AND A DOG NAMED CREAM GET LOST IN THE CITY TRYING TO FIND EACH OTHER. OH, MY GOD. RALPH, A CHILDREN'S BOOK. IT IS INCREDIBLE. BUT, I JUST-- I DON'T GET THE ENDING. WHY DOESN'T CREAM JUST BREAK THROUGH THE SCREEN AND GO GET PEACHES? I WASN'T SURE IF YOU... I MEAN, CREAM WASN'T SURE IF PEACHES WOULD HAVE HIM. DOG THAT HE IS. YOU, RALPH, ARE THE CREAM IN MY COFFEE. AND YOU ARE DEFINITELY A PEACH. YOU KNOW, IT'S BEEN A PRETTY LONG TIME SINCE I, UH... THE NEXT ONE SHOULD BE A DOOZIE, THEN, HUH? I THINK SO. SO, UH, MAYBE YOU SHOULD PLAY HOOKY. TAKE THE REST OF THE DAY OFF. WELL, WHAT DID YOU HAVE IN MIND? MAYBE A LITTLE LOVE IN THE AFTERNOON. WAIT, THE MOVIE OR... OH. HEY.
