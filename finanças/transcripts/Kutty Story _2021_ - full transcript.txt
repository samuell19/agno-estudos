Look at me Tell me the truth She will take better care of you than us, huh? - We'll help ourselves - You just keep the whole box there Shut up, will you? - Listen to me mimicking him - 'I will be back in 2 minutes' Will she take better care of you than us? She took care of you? Look at him laughing Tell me this I'm just curious You painted Trichy red with my shirts I lent you Did she ever 'grant' her shirt to you? You would've wanted her to Because you take me for 'granted'! You wrote pages of love letter to your girl with my pen, till the ink ran dry Did you tell her that? You won't believe this, machan With a shoe, he was literally shooed out of our hostel He made a beeline to my lap yelling to be saved, didn't you? Was her lap rented out then? Listen to this, machan Whenever you wanted I gave you my wallet- Brag all you like, but don't you say you gave money, you scrooge of a fellow! He hasn't lent 10 paisa to me I would've given him my check book! - Wait...waitees - Son of Scrooge!

Confess and your wife won't get mad at you In any case she wasn't your girlfriend then, right? Truth with a capital T - You won't mind, will you, Priya? - Why should I? Your face says it all He and I were practically strangers She said 'Sumangala is one helluva lucky woman' Sumangala should get mad She was the love of his life in Madras While he was having fun with Mrinalini in Trichy Wonder what else he was up to with Mrinalini over there - Disgusting! - Guys...guys, listen Priya Mrinalini and I We were in a platonic relationship - Oh gawd! - Same old dialog My ear drums have gone phut, hearing this I know 'plate' and 'tonic' What is his 'platonic'? Priya, till date I have no clue what that word means! Look what an innocent adult he is - Shut up, da - Sorry, dude Tell us exactly what happened that day What I've told you exactly a million times before Okay When he attended Miru's wedding one year after college He sneaked in and out His behavior was so weird He didn't talk to a single soul there He never got introduced to her family Something really fishy Narrate your story of your day with Miru in your aunt's place Just for the heck of it You'll get a new Aadhi flavor! - Go on, tell us - Come clean now You guys are such a disgrace! Then cough up the truth Okay, I'll tell you Shall I tell you something you haven't heard all these years? - Confession time - All ears Thank you Come on No, Miru I have to thank you Multiple times I swear I can feel the tears stinging my eyes You already thanked me With all this food Thank you accepted 'We sat on the floor Next to each other' We shared a friendship line That invisible line Only both of us can see it You don't know it In that beautiful moment I don't know what I had no such plan 'A thought flashed out of the blue' Close your eyes Why? 'Action replay' Close your eyes please Why? Miru, just trust me Close your eyes No, Aadhi, no Not your hand With your dupatta Smooth operator! My blood pressure is shooting up! Whaat? Please Is it a gift? Didn't we have a deal? We decided no gifts Please close your eyes - Aad- - Please What? Why are you looking at him? 'Why is he bursting with tension?' "Not love however" "No lust whatsoever" "On your cheeks my lips An imprint of friendship" "The unexpected kiss" "My dear friend, mortified and scared" "Listen to the truth, why I dared" "Not your mistake, my thank you gift" "The unexpected kiss' Miru...I'm sorry I am- I'm leaving I'm so sorry, Miru It isn't what you think- You have a girlfriend in Madras You love each other Going steady for 6 years You have even told me once she is your future wife Then how could you kiss me? Why did you kiss me? Bang on! You think that was a right question? Miru, I wanted to thank you My intention was only a 'thank you' kiss No other agenda Just a kiss and whisper a 'thank you' in your ear I would have myself told you to go home It's getting late, right? Nothing else would've happened, Miru I have no ulterior motive I swear on my mother And it's not a plan Just a split second brainwave That's all "Not your fault, it was my slip" "The unexpected kiss" "Boundaries of our friendship" "Not crossed; nothing amiss" "Though no way Thank you I could say" I enjoyed the lunch "Love's lava precious" You don't have to thank me No need 'sorry' either "Like Mount Vesuvius" This friendship with you was beautiful It IS "The unexpected kiss" "Aadhi son of a gun, smooth operator He lies glibly, fibber of the first order" "Liar liar, his pants on fire Our very own master story teller" It's the whole truth 'He shakes his head happily after having fun heartily" Priya, he swore on his mother Go down and check on her Hey! This happened 2 decades ago He swore on his mother decades ago That's true, right? Hey! I didn't censor anything because my wife is here I didn't play the field That's what I'm asking Which base? 3rd or 4th? Machan, not our man She took it to the next level Eff you! Don't you dare malign her - Shut up - Hey! You started the ball rolling, not us! Covered her eyes with her dupatta and Prince Charming kissed her! What B.S! Taking us for a ride? It was a 'play-tonic' kiss it seems We are all born yesterday, just a baby But this is the Oracle of Aadhi! Shit! This son of a gun is making me fire bad words, I'm blushing pink now! Priya, please go inside Basically I'm a very orthodox family you know Only if you go in, sugar and spice will surface out We'll get to the base of it! But I swear I must tell you this, machan You missed your calling in life to become a super script writer! I swear the very next day knowing it was a blunder on my part I wrote a letter to Miru - Letter to her too? - My god! How many girls will he write to? When we call him he hangs up on us with colorful cuss words and a short OK! Not even OK Just 'K'! Listen, I wrote I apologized for the kiss and all that jazz of wanting only to thank her I clarified and posted the letter My letter landed in Miru's dad's hands the next day and he threw a fit - Terrific twist! - He grabbed a stick to hit you He asked her 'Who is this Aadhi?' Hey! Cut the crap, rascal He wouldn't have asked so decently Mach-aan, he asked her 'Who is this Aadhi?' Swear on your mother again I swear he may swear again! Okay, out with it He gave her a shelling and accompanied her to college for the next 10 days He found out your true colors! I couldn't talk to her properly after that Then our final exams and last day of college I came back here to Madras After 3 months I broke up with Sumangala 'Tell us that story again' Let's not rake that up now After that Priya and I were into this platonic relationship Platonic here also, huh? How many girls did you 'play-tonic' with? He had a field day with 4 kids through her, machan It started with a platonic- Platonic is an excuse for a pregnant-spree! 1st platonic and only after that 4 kids Okay, then...continue Garnish it with more spice So that's the story We attended Miru's wedding, right? I didn't get introduced to her family because of this letter issue You know this I didn't hide it from you The 'kiss' letter was the reason you know only now Son of a gun! Zipped our lips now Climax is a damp squib! You had some feelings for her That's why you kissed her Crucify him If you were just friends why this need to kiss her? You crossed your invisible line that day Sorry, Priya A big NO It was a very innocent moment I made no prior plan May be I was overwhelmed and felt a tad too emotional May be but- Love and all those feelings...no Then it was a friendship kiss? - 'Yes, pure friendship - I won't buy this' 'This is something else' Like I said, not my problem I wasn't in his life then Anyway you guys continue I'll go check on the kids Machan, your wife is mad at you Anyway you have to sleep solo tonight You can sleep in our room if you like but no more platonic tales She isn't mad at me No chance of that I know Forget this, how many times did you meet Miru after that? Thrice, dude You know she attended our reunion in Trichy - Yes - Then met her twice in U.S - No sparks? - What? Sparks? He doesn't get this concept? You and I are friends, right? Do sparks fly between us? No? It's the same, machan - Of course we share sparks - What sparks? Because my life 24 years taking in your hand Because of sparks, machan He's such a buffoon! So that's it, machan Like the rapport we share Just friends Just that she and I are damn man and woman! Impossible No chance of 'just for friendship' concept between man and woman, machan Priya and you validate my theory Proof staring in my face Then what? You are both friends? - Platonic? - Yes - What is the climax? - What? 4 kids running around I rest my case Leave me alone, everybody 'What did you say?' He wants to rest his- Anyway reason I went down memory lane Miru is coming here in 3 weeks En route to Bangalore She wanted to meet me and of course I said 'yes' - Why didn't you tell Priya? - I will, machan - Eff you, call her then - I'll tell her tomorrow I tell her everything She knows everything about me Take me with you I want to meet Miru too In that area alone I swear you're forbidden My route got cut when it was all fine thanks to this bum here - 'I praised you sky high' - Shut up! Even if I call her nowadays she spews shit on the phone Hey! Give him a drink, dude 'It's not good for health Please go out now' I've ordered green tea for you too - You want anything else? - Yeah...yeah, green tea is good I'll...I'll order something if I want later So good to see you Thanks for making time to meet me Now shall I just leave, Miru? - Why are you so formal? - No - I...I mean it - Okay How long are you here? I mean are you here on work or something? Less than 2 hours, Aadhi My flight to Bangalore is at 7 I'm going to a Yoga retreat there Yoga retreat? So that's the secret of how you're looking But I've come here only to meet you That's sweet It's so good to see you too, Miru Nothing No agenda at all Just- Just felt like talking to you for a good 2 hours So I'll be talking non stop Put up with me I've been your ears always! That's easy actually Yeah All good? Yeah, all good In fact one of the best phases of my life How's your wife Priya and the kids? All of them Busy Days just flying Time's just flying I was just thinking this morning I need a stop or a standstill moment You know a family time together That bonding has to get priority It will happen Not for me, Aadhi Actually I had too much of it I want my own space I needed the 'me' time That's why I just took off Kids are fine They are with their dad now When I get back I'll bring them to my place Yeah We have separated, Aadhi I mean my husband and me Don't ask me why Even I don't have an answer Out of the blue one day we both felt this bond wasn't working out We discussed, decided And he left I think it must be about 8 months now He comes now and then to visit the kids He's a good father So that side is being taken care of That's all I'm... I'm so sorry to hear that, Miru No...no Don't be It's fine I'm good It was good while it lasted But it just faded into oblivion I didn't give it much thought back then I mean when I agreed to get married Surprising really Considering the kind of woman I was and still am Yeah I won't brand him as 'wrong choice' In which case I am the wrong choice for him as well When they said 'she is your fiancée' He didn't think much either We just weren't made for each other But- I won't call all the years we've been married as waste of time My children mean the world to me I can't think of a life without them So it's all good When I look back and connect the dots Any which way you look at it I'm...I'll serve you some tea Sure That's good Thanks I'm sorry, I want to talk to you about you Can I? Yeah When we were in college, you were in love only with Sumangala, right? You had this one-track mind of marrying her and settling down When you came here to Madras you broke up with Sumangala You fell in love with Priya and married her Have you ever thought the 6 years you spent with Sumangala was a waste of your time? No But it was a waste of precious time for me The time frame you were both in love The 6 year phase you were in love with her Or the 3 years you were in love with her when I was your best friend Time waste, Aadhi For me Knowing you are head over heels in love with her, you'll marry her, I didn't prof- Aadhi This has been whirling in my mind for a long time I zipped my lips about it I feel I was wrong not telling you Especially in the present situation I feel it is the right time to tell you I feel this heart to heart will free my bottled up feelings into a new world It will open up fresh avenues for me For me Issues concerning only me I think I'll be free then That's the main reason for my visit I lied when I said I had no other agenda Sorry I don't know how clearly I can express what I feel When it comes to you My words somehow get jumbled up So this is the letter I've penned my thoughts into Aren't you the Letter King? Aadhi This is what I wanted to tell you I want you to read it in front of me After you read it, don't say a word You don't have to do anything That day in your aunt's house you told me you had no ulterior motive This is ditto If that was true So is this Read it right here and tear it in front of me I'll leave without saying another word 'I remember the 1st day I met you, 1st year of college' 'I thought you were a hooligan' '3 weeks later when I heard you speak' 'I wondered how a rowdy like you could have such a refined velvet soft voice' 'But even my 1st impression of you as a hooligan' '...didn't deter me from falling in love with you' 'Pure and simple love I knew it, 100 %' 'Grapevine said you had a steady girlfriend back in Madras' 'I assumed it was the usual bragging macho image' 'Charming Madras boy already hooked' 'But the confirmation poured in from multiple sources' 'All our friends told me you loved her to the moon and back' 'So I resisted the attraction' 'I should delete you from my thoughts' 'I shouldn't even talk to you and 1 year whizzed by' 'But in our II year I couldn't resist talking to you' 'Or befriending you' 'I heard you sing too' 'I decided I had to be your friend and my dream came true' 'Love...I trashed that feeling' 'I tried and became your friend' 'Like your best friend' 'And you became my best friend' 'You made a huge difference to my life much more than all my girl friends' 'I basked in the warmth of the time we spent together' 'Life was a bed of roses' 'One day you invited me over to your aunt's house' 'You kissed me' 'Towards the very end' 'Tail end of a blissful college life' 'My heart shattered into smithereens in that moment in time' 'Every inch of me yearned for your touch wanted more of your kisses' 'And screamed out to be nestled in your arms most willingly' 'But you didn't hear me You were blissfully ignorant' 'I even brought up Sumangala's name then' 'To clarify-' 'Insisting it was a kiss of gratitude' '...you swore on your mom denying any other intention' 'I cursed myself for jumping to wrong conclusions' 'When my dad broached the subject of finding a groom for me that night' 'I relented, I said yes' 'I saw you a year later on my wedding day' 'I couldn't talk to you' 'Then after a long time I heard you got married too' 'I heard your wife was not Sumangala but Priya' 'The cussword 'wretched fellow' flared in my mind' 'That's all' 'Please tear my life story-letter without saying a single word' 'Serious, let's not dissect this' 'Let me leave now' 'We'll meet again in this lifetime' 'Still be this same precious bond' 'If there's really another birth' 'Come to me as my friend in that life as well' 'We'll go with the flow' I still have a lot of time before my flight I'll leave only after a while If you are busy you can leave No worries This is Prabhakar's 24x7 dialog 'A man and a woman can never be friends, machan' 'He said this to me even 3 weeks ago' Hereafter I can't argue with him or din my point into his head He claims the proof to his theory is the bond Priya and I share Now you and me No He is the one who is wrong We've been friends, Aadhi Only friends Always forever we'll be only friends In a weird kind of way that is the whole truth But I...I can't tear this letter Give it to me I'll do it for you You've written this to me Your 1st letter to me It will be safe with me I'll cherish even the paper I can't tear this, sorry No, Aadhi Not because I'm scared someone will get the wrong idea reading it No shared confidences You don't have this letter That's all This conversation, this meeting, this letter Doesn't exist Just you and me is real And our friendship It was beautiful It IS! For once I'm tongue-tied, Miru I told you so? You don't have to utter a single word That's the crux of the matter Seriously, whatever I say will be like I am belittling you I won't ask you why you never told me this Even if you had- 'I know you wouldn't have guessed, Aadhi' 'Him and Me' 'Chennai' "…forget it ...when're you coming" Stop kidding, Sis?

What wrong did I do? - I'm only in Level 1 - Level 1 player, that's all? Then have you built a house? I'm an expert at building houses - Sorry, did I spittle? - I didn't mean that house? Have you built a house in the game? Oh! You mean 'house'? I had a 'cutting' and I was cutting wood at home A wild boar came and attacked me It was an intense fight I hit it with a fierce blow I don't know if you saw, ma'am but that's when you came to save me Agreed...agreed, I lied If you hadn't entered and saved me it would have made mincemeat of me Thank you so much Now you don't kill me please Then what I said was 100% right - What did you say? - Madcap! Oh! Like that? Thank you...thank you I just don't mind, ma'am You can call me whatever Hmmm...be focused I won't skip any task hereafter, okay? You tell me what I should do You don't have to do anything If you want to be safe tonight - Come home with me - Whaat? To your place? Welcome to my home Wow! Awesome! Soooper! All these belong to you, ma'am? Hello, listen You should mind your own business Come, stay and just leave Instead if you dare touch my treasure Before the Blood Raiders come and kill you I swear I'll pre-empt them! - Aiyo! - Understood? Why this murderous rage? I don't need any of these gems, ma'am Your house, your rules, ma'am Basically I'm a good boy You can come and ask in my area if you like, ma'am Please don't 'ma'am' me Call me 'Eve'! Oh! Okay - Eve - What? I just tried calling your name - Eve - Whaat? I let your name roll on my tongue for fun 'Eve...Eve' - 'Modulation correct?' - Silly fellow! Eve Eve What to do if the Blood Raiders find this house or me? 'Come on, relax' 'This house is highly protected from Blood Raiders' 'No way can they find my place' Thank God! That means we are safe You have literally a treasure trove here! What will you do with all these? What a silly question! To enter the Emerald world If I take the Philosopher stone over there I go straight to the climax level That's my goal Ideal goal indeed! Simply awesome You are something else! Wish I could join you Your bed ...is over there! Come on, go But aren't we already friends? Adam-Eve Should we sleep alone even in the game? I won't put my leg on you and hassle you - Can I also crash here? - Dai! Get lost! I was just kidding Took it seriously or what? Actually I want to ask you something Why did you save me? Oh! You want to know why? My blessed fate! No, I am asking you seriously Why did you rescue me? I got a notification in the game It was pointing towards your direction I came thinking this was a task I came and searched for you When I looked around Out of the blue I saw a pig over there Hitting you black and blue Excuse me, that isn't a pig, boar - Wild boar - Whatever, let it be In Tamil it is referred to as 'pig', right? I mean, wild boar? Look at that Your face turned a fierce red when I said 'pig'! Okay, let me come to the point Having come here, I thought might as well kill the boar Will get tasty pork to eat And enough gold to add to my treasure But saving you was a pure accident Oh! Like that But so magnanimous of you If I had been in your shoes I would have happily whistled and walked away Are you good as gold? Yeah, basically- Sweat dreams! Soooper game! Deadly fight!! The way she flew down and stood in front of me - Wow! - Aiyo!! Then you just drooled Didn't play at all? She flew gracefully and stood, machi So breathtakingly beautiful Hey! Are you thinking a mere 'avatar' is a real girl? Is she a real chick? Do you remember 6 months ago our bro- He was chatting in FB 24x7 In the end what happened? 'She' turned out to be an uncle?! That's a heady feel, da Are you taking a dig at me? I heard her voice Chic chick! Confirmed You can mock at me for all I care I'm in love 'Let's close shop Wrap it all up' You'll get it from me! 'Hey! Madcap' 'Don't you have any sense of time?' Hey, waiteees! Patience please 'Check where I am in the map and better land there' I'm coming...1 second Hey! Where are you? Why be so tense? It's just a game We can play in a relaxed manner You won't understand if I explain You are the one with less points Focus and try to collect your coins Why do you keep bullying me? If you just tell me I'll get it I'm 25 years young! By the way how old are you? 1 year older than last year Next year I will be 1 year older than this year! Asking a girl her age? Do you have an iota of decency or manners? Tell me, you madcap? Madam, forgive me The words just tumbled out! Okay, let me ask you directly Will you give me your WhatsApp # or not? - She looks up when I ask for her #! - We have to leave now, let's go I asked for your # and you're changing the topic happily Why are you running? At least tell me and then run You...goddamn! Blood Raiders, da Eve Why are they chasing us now? Did you see the gold coins in our hands? Now you know the reason The game is testing us Will you sprint faster? If it's so dangerous just let go, Eve Why take this kind of risk? Eve, what is happening? I'm asking you We are in trouble That's all I can say now You said your home is highly protected Now you're saying 'we are in trouble' I don't know how long this protection will last, Adam I haven't encountered Blood Raiders at such close quarters till now What joy do they get killing us? Not 'us', Adam Just you! Me...? I'm an useless piece anyway Oh! They don't know that, right? With the click of your finger tell me how I should upgrade Sorry, you can't Whaaat? I can't- We have to fight Adam No other option Oh my God! What happened? Wait, I'm coming Adam? Hello, my dear precious princess! How is your upgraded 'madcap 2.O'? This is why the game must have brought me to you Saving myself by saving you! Shouldn't say it like that You saved me while I saved you That sounds good High 5! Hello, Eve Are you online? Hello, you there? Eve I want to speak with you in private Heart to heart Personal chat Actually I miss playing with you To be honest I miss you, di Why beat around the bush? Let me say it straight from my heart I'm in love with you 'Pyaar, Prema, Kaadhal' Whichever...whatever I'm unable to pinpoint what I love most about you Your entry, attitude? Stubborn streak? Or your temper tantrums? Aiyoooo! I love all these and more Why are you torturing me like this, dear? Pccht! You don't have to profess your love immediately? But don't feel shy and hold back Whether you think about this lying on your back or stomach Whatever the position Those 3 words I want to hear Will you tell me in 10 seconds? 10 is too short, no? 20...? Hey! Go to bed, madcap Eve...? 'Are you online?' Hello...Eve? Hello...? Eve? You heard what I said? Oh! Shaa! "You are a riddle, my dear" "First tell me your name here" "You are my faithful shadow" "Who am I here if you move away now?" "O' girl who chats with me in virtual reality daily" "I fell in love with you in real life too" "In the blink of my eye I knew" "I realized my feelings for you" "Isn't this love crystal clear? Why be stubborn, my dear?" "Come out of the shadows, face to face We can share love and laughter always" "O' girl, I am you, you are me" "Mind is like the clouds truly waiting to burst duly" "Change as rain and shower on me Lass, let's unite till eternity" "Together, you and me" "Girl, you threaten or bully me Knowing I love you madly" "I will hug you close to me for a lifetime in reality" "Isn't this love so sincere? Why be stubborn, my dear?" "Come out of the shadows, to our real life We will live happily as man and wife" "O' girl, I am you, you are me" "Mind is like the laden clouds, dearie" "Change as rain and shower on me Princess, let's unite till eternity" "Let's be, me & you, you & me" What are you doing, Eve? I'm taking the Philosopher stone How? By returning all that we collected so far? We finished all the challenges just now Why this tearing hurry so soon? True but we haven't stepped into the Emerald world, right? My goal - I need that Philosopher stone - Aiyo! Don't I know this, Eve? All I'm asking is why be in such a rush? As we go to a higher level challenges will become tougher The time we spend together will lessen, Eve Don't you know this? You know about this game much more than I do Knowing all that should you do this? That too right now? Why can't we be the 1st winners of this game, Adam? Aiyo! By all means, I agree But why rush into this like a hurricane? If we enter the Emerald world and one of us dies ...we can't use that account We have to start fresh Don't you know that? What is so difficult to understand here? I've been telling you that stone is my dream come true from day #1 You even said, 'Soooper! Awesome! Wish I could join you' Why are you suddenly firing questions piled up at me? Oh gawd! Eve The moments we spend together seem more important than that stone We can't take a risk for a mere stone, Eve Madcap! Is this what's bothering you? Once we get that stone I'll share my WhatsApp # with you, simple Then we will chit-chat daily This is just a game Why are you getting so senty? Fine then You'll give me your WhatsApp # Then we can happily take any kind of risk for this stone If I had known this I wouldn't have spoken for so long breathlessly! You know for me, taking a risk is as enjoyable as munching a rusk! 'Madcap!' You forgot the suffix '2.O'! Woah! So this is Emerald world, huh? Semma! Truly awesome Eve, doesn't this level alone seem different from the others? Looks like a horror set for a Disney film! We've come all this way Let's go and take the stone Why am I talking to myself? We are making such a huge effort Will we get any bonus? 'Aadi' discount sale is in mid-July I'll find out if Vasanth& Co will give you a special offer? Joke, huh? Eve, did you notice something? We have been walking on this bridge for so long But that castle is still so far away Adam, I sense something wrong here What are you saying? - Adam? - What, Eve? - Tell me - I think we are stuck in a loop - We must scoot - What loop? We have to go, come Where are you going? Don't run, di Eve, don't run, please Stop...stop Please stay right there Listen to me Don't jump, Eve Hey! Eve EVE...! I told you Shit, man Eve! What the- Hello...? Eve...? Please talk to me 'Bro?' Bro...? Bro Bro, you told me a story like 'Kadhal Koattai' And stopped suddenly Read all the comments Touching the sky!! Then what happened, bro? Only later I found out, bro The game won't be easy after this point What we had collected in all those levels All gone! On top of it all Eve Will she come or not? I know she won't come But...I didn't want to give up I got to know her in the first few weeks we got to play the game together Stubborn female! She has to perform a task by herself Highly independent Won't let anyone help her 'If she changes her mind some day and she returns-' I decided even if I'm not around I should do something specially for her I think a million times before I take a risk in the game I hunted high and low for her sake, taking many risks in life In Logam game for her sake I built a sky castle for her choosing every single brick and stone Singlehanded I went and got the Philosopher stone 'Everything was only for her' She is the reason for everything That's why I'm right here in front of you as Top 5 player It's all because of her All because of you, Eve Eve sister If you are watching this video please shower your mercy on our Adam I went with the flow and said 'Kaadhal Koattai' But our brother has really built a castle of love for you He is waiting for you So please, just 1 day Go and log in And see it for yourself 'How long did it take to build this castle, bro?' - Vijay? - Madam Manage here I'll be back '6 months?! No way, bro' 'Viewers, developers have give free access to all of you too' 'Don't miss seeing this castle of love' 'And also one more important thing' 'Viewers, we need your help even more now' 'Share this video to the maximum extent possible, till it reaches Eve' 'And I have a soooper piece of news for you' 'To enable Eve to view the castle built by Adam Vice, Logam's creators have' '...reactivated Eve's account' 'So Eve, please...please' 'Go and see the castle of love Adam has built for you' 'Just only once' 'Go and see what this young man has created for you, Eve' Akka...? Isn't he your gaming partner? Akka, how happy you were during that period Even I was feeling jealous Instead of spending time with me ...you were with this Adam full time in this game, sis You have any idea how mad I was at you? You know, don't you, Maya? How all of us were shattered when I was diagnosed with cancer? When my faith in surviving gradually ebbed away from me Just for a deviation I entered this game world Only in that make-believe world I met this Adam He started changing me completely, Maya I fell for his endearing innocence Slowly, I fell in love with him too I wondered how I could be so happy in an imaginary world? Life, life bars Karma points Death inside the game Here I'm going through stage 4 cancer I don't want to cheat him, Maya And I don't want to cheat myself Why are you being so negative, akka? You've always been full of positivity You'll only see the positive side in everything and everyone Even after regarding this game as a positive diversion... ...you flung aside Adam the positive factor in your life He loves me, Maya Beyond it being a mere game SO MUCH love Poor thing, Maya I don't want to give him my negativity Let him have a peaceful life Without knowing me or anything about me Just see this, akka What he has done for you Please take a look - Maya - For my sake Just once, take a tour inside No, Maya, stop it - Just see once what he has done for you - Won't you listen to me? Hey! Adam is calling you - Don't...don't answer - Wait, akka Hello...? Is that Eve? - Yeah...yeah - 'Got a message you logged in' - 1 second...1 second - Hey! No - No...no - Akka, please 'Talk to him' 'Why can't you listen to me?' 'You listen to me for a change' First take the phone Hello...Eve? 'Can you hear me?' Hello...? Eve? Eve? Hey! Madcap, tell me English subtitles by rekhs 'Song & Dance' "You kick me in your sleep and ruin my nights" "Sleepy head! You never text and I hate the way you dress!" "You jump into puddles and also drag me in" "All work no play! You whine all day yet you never wanna meet my friends!" "Hey, show-off!" "No one can tolerate your games" "Putting up with you is my job" "Who else have you got but me?" "I can't take it! I can't sleep" "But I am stuck with you..." "The way you look, talk, seduce, ask..." "...scold, provoke, poke, fake it..." "glare, beat, kick and act!" "I just can't take it anymore!" "You talkless, rockless, tasteless, shameless..." "jobless, thoughtless, useless, clueless..." "walkless, topless, sockless, shoeless..." "Listen dude, I hate your mess!" Hello? Hello? Unbelievable! Hello! Dude... Hello! Dude? Hello? Where the hell were you? Right here... You were stretching, right? How did you know? What's wrong with you, man? Can't that wait? Remember, health is wealth! There he goes again! What's the hurry? You're jobless anyway! C'mon, man! Who else can I talk to? Don't insult me. Don't you usually whine to... - Who? - Wait... what's his name? Krishnakumar? He's in bad shape, man. No more sharing with him. "Sharing?" Stop talking like a girl, dude. What? Behave like men do. Oh! Riding all those girly scooters has messed you guys up. Dude, tell me if you want me to stop... ...but don't bring in gender politics here. It's not politics. It's pure sense. Yes... - My boss... - Play with me! ...and then my wife starts nagging me! 'There's no water!' 'Did you fix the bulb?' 'Did you pay the bills?' 'Did you book tickets?' Things are so crazy that... ...I sometimes forget to eat lunch. Now that Corona is wiping us out... I thought they'd give me a break... ...but no! Nothing has changed! Dude, one sec... Wondering how I forgot lunch when working from home? No... Did you really hear me stretching over the phone? Get lost, jerk! I'm not telling you! - Honey! - Okay, don't. Honey! Peace! Come, help me with this. I am coming I'll call you back. Where did it go? Uncle... I thought I saw a hawk. I'm waiting to see if it comes again. Is it a good luck thing? Yes it is. - It was right here. - Okay, uncle. I had to make a call... Please go ahead. It's okay, uncle. Stay if you want. No problem. I was leaving anyway. Okay, uncle. Hello Madhu Hello Babe... Babe? You there? Were you silent? So... ...I've been waiting for your call all these days. If... ...we were together, you don't even have to say a word. I'd have kept admiring you. Hello?! Babe! Say something. Do you remember… ...the last time we met? You were wearing that red dress. You were, what everyone would call, 'The Great Beauty'! A sight to behold! Yes... ...that's how you looked! Enough... Why? Why are you stopping me? Is that why you called me? Enough, now. Where's your wife? Why so concerned about my wife? Planning to join my family? Who do you love more: your wife or me? You, of course! That was quick. What's wrong with your voice? What happened? I'm sick. Take care. Take care of yourself. There's a pandemic going on. It's the ice cream I ate last night. I'll be fine. I hope you're wearing a mask when going out. Where are you? At home. Where exactly? In my bedroom. Wonderful! Perfect! What you wearing? Hello? Where's your daughter? My daughter is downstairs. Don't change the topic! What are you wearing? Leggings...? Saree...? Or...? Or...? Say something. Please! Only then can I start fantasizing. Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello! I'll probably grow old before I find out what you're wearing. Hang on. I'll video-call you. I'm not wearing a skimpy costume So, no need for a video call. Hey, getting you undressed is the whole idea. Then why? My daughter is home, and so is my father. I can't strut around half-naked, can I? Huh? F... father? Father? Daughter? Where exactly are you? It was me you were talking to, not her. You want to know how I did this, right? I had my doubts... ...so I saved my number under that contact. As for the voice... I used a software. I called her, pretending to be a saleswoman. I recorded her voice... ...and then the software did the rest. In order to contain the spread of Coronavirus... these are the best practices everyone should be aware of. So please listen carefully... and strictly follow these best practices. The best precaution... Would you like some water? This is painful. Please... Please... I screwed up. I'll even fall at your feet... Forgive me. Please! What's stopping you then? It's not serious. It wasn't emotional. It was just fun. Fun?! Wait... - Let go! - Okay...Okay... Kuchu... Kuchu, we have a child. You're the mother of my child. You, me... and our baby... ...we are one. But don't you love her more? No... no... Well... Wait... Wait...Wait... It's a mid-life crisis. Please understand. Babe... ...please! Babe?! Kuchu! Crap! Shall we eat? Please inform us if any of you have symptoms. Why do you keep saying the same thing?! You'll never change! He's having lunch. "They say you have a thousand eyes" "But how come you still can't see me?" "My heart is melting" "To hold you in the palm of my hands" "My words are slurring without your presence" "They say you have a thousand eyes" "But how come you still can't see me?" Hello? I'm at the terrace. Freshen up and come here. We need to talk. Where are you going, daddy? To the terrace, baby. Okay! Have some tea. Could you sit over there? Please forgive me. It... it was my fault. Please forgive me. I am the one who screwed up. I'm an- I'm sorry. Well... just after we got engaged... I cheated on you once, with my ex-boyfriend. I'll consider this as punishment for what I did. But I screwed up first, so please forgive me... The guilt killed me… I even wanted to confess before we got married... ...but I just couldn't. But only after you cheated did I realize how painful it feels. How? Who was it? Kamatchi. Kamatchi? Kamatchi?! Kamatchi Sundaram. Where? How did it happen? Well... I... I... No! No! Don't tell me. Don't... You... "All the truths you were too shy to tell me..." "Here I am on stage, singing them aloud..." "All the lies you lovingly hid from me..." "I stole them while you were asleep..." "Speaking the truth hurts but..." "Time will heal that pain..." "Lies sound sweeter but..." "Time will ruin the relationship..." "All the truths you were too shy to tell me..." "Here I am on stage, singing them aloud..." Wow, your mask is so cool! It's new, grandpa! Your husband, ma'am? He was working late. Can you come back tomorrow? Sure, ma'am. Thanks. 8-Bit... Yes, bro? I need to hack a profile. Individual or a company? Individual... Who is it, bro? Dude! They have to know... My wife... Oh... okay. Do you want us to skim the surface or dig deep? Dig as deep as you can. I need every single detail. Okay, bro. Give me seven hours. What was that noise? Nothing, uncle. The hackers have completed the report. The package has been delivered. We've sent you an email ID and password. Take a look, bro. Come. Sit down. - What...? - Here. What kind of game is this? How can you lie about such things? I know you're mad at me… ...but this is too much. I checked with all your friends and relatives. I'm not proud of it... ...but there is no harm. You've never had a boyfriend called Kamatchi. The only Kamatchi was three years your senior in college... ...and he doesn't even know your name. Punish me all you want... ...but this is just too much. Please forgive me. I promise I'll never betray you again. Please forgive me. Okay... What do you mean, 'okay'? Let's forgive each other. To hell with your forgiveness! Why lie about such things just to get back at me? It's a lie, isn't it? Tell me. Fine... let's just forget this and move on. Hey! Forget? What do you want me to forget? I just told you that I checked thoroughly and found nothing. Why can't you agree with me? Say 'Yes' before you go. Yes. Where do you think you're going? Okay... What's your problem? Want me to go crazy? Look at me! I haven't slept for two days! I've been losing my mind, trying to find this guy! I even called up my friend and told him about this. Such things can't even be shared with friends. With his help, I got the best hackers. I searched for all the KamatchiSundarams... ...in your school, college and neighbourhood. I searched everywhere and finally found one guy! Turns out he was your college senior. I then called him and asked if he really was in a relationship with you. Despite all my threats, he kept denying it... ...and yet I'm not at peace! Was it really Kamatchi Sundaram or someone else... If I'm supposed to live with you after knowing you cheated on me... ...can't you live without knowing if I've cheated on you or not? Kuchu... Kuchu... Kuchu, wait. I want to talk to you. Please! I want to talk. - I want to talk to you. - What do you want to talk about? I don't know. You want to know the truth, right? No! No! The lesson you taught me in the past two days is more than enough. Forgive me. Please! Kuchu dear! Kuchu dear!
