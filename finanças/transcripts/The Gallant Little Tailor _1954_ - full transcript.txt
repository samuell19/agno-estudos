NARRATOR: ln a little town in a country long ago lived a little tailor in a little room, who worked happily at his stitching all day long. WOMAN: Jams for sale! Jams for sale! Jams for sale and he's so very hungry. Mmm, very good. That's good, too. That's wonderful! But the little tailor said he wanted a very little pot of jam and the woman had climbed all those stairs for nothing. (BUZZlNG) Aha! One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. Seven in one stroke! The little tailor wanted the whole world to know he'd killed seven flies at one stroke, so he decided to put the words on his belt. Seven in one stroke! The little tailor was so proud of having killed seven flies in one stroke that he decided to go off to the big town to seek his fortune. Night was falling and the gates were closed. The king of that town was very worried, because two giants had been frightening the people. And he could find no one strong enough to capture the giant. The people of the town were amazed to read the little tailor had killed seven in one stroke. They thought it meant that he'd killed seven men. Such a brave man would capture the giants for them. The knight had been sent to capture the giants and had come back defeated. The soldier ran to the king with news of the little tailor's courage. The king asked the little tailor whether he could capture the giants, and the little tailor said that was nothing for one who had killed seven at one stroke. So the king put the little tailor in command of the soldiers and told him to go off and capture the giants.
