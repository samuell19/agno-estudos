But I don't want to be moved back to Earth. Your fate is inevitable, my little earthling. How does this always happen to me? We're out of cards. I'll do it. You all ready to be taken down? Somebody's getting big for their boots. If that's what you call confidence. How many points is everyone on? 46. 32. 28. Action one, attempt to establish the economic centre. Hand me the cosmic wormhole. How many points do you think she needs? I don't know. How many is she on? Please don't be purple. Please don't be purple. Noooooo! 52 points. And that's how it's done. Ugh, she didn't even need the other two turns. I'm the Queen of the Universe. You're so stupid. It's true. Technically only the Queen of one galaxy. It's not fair, you always win. Well done, Charlotte. You girls need to go to bed. I won the game! I've put Benji to bed, and your Dad's going to be home any minute. But we're not sleepy yet. Astronauts don't have time for sleep. Don't tell me you're all into space too. I find it inconceivable that you're blind to the wonders of the Universe. You speak so funny for a 9 year old. I just don't see the need for space travel when there's a bunch of stuff we need to sort out on our own planet. You do know America only spends 0.5% on its budget for NASA. And don't you want to know what's out there? Life would be so boring if there was nothing left to discover. When I look at the stars, I see our whole future. Alright, alright, you win. But you still need to go to bed. Come on. Your Dad said you could only have a sleepover if you were in bed by 9:30pm and it's gone 10. Our Earth orbits the Sun. Which is one out of billions of suns in our galaxy. Which is one out of billions of galaxies in the universe Tell me that doesn't blow your mind. It actually makes me feel scared and inconsequential. Meaning isn't found in comfort but in truth. Come on, Armstrong. Good boy. Good night, girls. Good night. Make sure the bugs don't bite. So who wants to see what I've been working on. I am Me two. Me three. I've been working on our transportation for the last 7 days. And tonight it is ready to be unveiled. I'm so excited. My god, you've done it. You must all answer your question to earn your place on the mission. I'll go first. Ok. Who was the first American woman to go to space? That's so easy. Sally Ride. Congratulations Commander Nikita. Me next. What is the name of the boundary where outter space begins? The Karman Line. Correct, welcome aboard. Now for the final space on our crew. Amelia, are you ready? Oh, I'm so nervous. I really want a place on the mission. Oh, just ask me! Ok, what is the hottest planet in our solar system? Mercury or Venus. Mercury is closest to the Sun. But could this be a trick question? I'm going to go with Venus. Venus has lots of clouds on it. Venus. Congratulations, you chose well. Yes! Ssh. What are you doing? Now look what you've done. Benji, we're not doing anything. Go back to bed. But I want to play. You have to be over 7. And this isn't play, it's a serious mission. I'll tell on you if you don't let me stay. Benji, this is important. You can't tell anyone. Why not? Because life on Earth depends on it. And because adults don't understand. And also because if you tell, we'll have to throw Chuckles out of the window. Where the foxes will eat him alive. Yes, that as well. Fine, you can join the mission. But you have to do everything I tell you to, ok? Alright, everyone gather 'round. We've been training for this our whole lives. Does everyone remember their positions? Command Module Pilot at your service. Flight engineer. Mission Control. What do I do, Charlotte? You're a Spaceflight Participant. A Spaceflight Participant. Which means you'll need one of these. Everyone assume their positions. Release at the T-minus 19. Launch control, this is Amelia. We are go for launch. Roger that, Amelia. We are ready. We are all clear. 10, 9, 8, 7. Ignition sequence. 3, 2, 1. Ignition! We have a lift off! It's lightening up the skies here at The Crescent Space Station. Looking great from down here. Good show. Lift off complete. Sophia, so sorry I'm late. We've got a problem. Repeat, we've got a problem. I'll just check in on the girls. I'm getting incoming traffic. Danger, danger! Oh god. Help! What, my dears, has been going on here? Daddy! Our mission failed, Mr. Parker. Your mission? We embarked on our first proper mission into space. Daddy, you should have seen it. I don't know what went wrong. Don't worry. It's the first of many. Do you know one of the most important things for young astronauts? Sleep. To recharge those brain cells. And do you know the other two most important things? Imagination and hard work. That's right. Daddy, I'm sleepy. No wonder, my little rascal. It's way past your bedtime. Good night, sweet astronauts. And may flights of space dream you into sleep.
