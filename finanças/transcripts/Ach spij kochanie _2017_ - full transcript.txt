Excuse me, I need a stop. KRAKOW, 1955 So where's the body? They didn't tell you? The man is alive. He came in with a headache. X-ray showed a piece of metal in his skull. We removed this during the operation. Do you have any enemies? Me, enemies? I am a peaceful man, Officer. And you don't know who shot you? No. And do you believe in God? Of course not Comrades, me? That's odd, because it's a miracle you're not a dead man. And miracles don't happen twice. Especially to someone… of no faith. I'm telling the truth. You… Dederko. Know how it works? The more you lie to us, the more we see through you. Somebody shot you. It didn't work so he'll try again. Fine, fine… I was in Zakopane a few days ago. Made some money and we had some fun. Who did you party with? Władek Mazurkiewicz. Józek… What… What was that? What was that? What? What is it? I scared you. What was that? It was a Dollar, this explosive toy. - What, don't you know it? - No. There is a slot here, you put a cap inside… What cap? Come on, I had to wake you up. I need to talk when I'm driving otherwise I fall asleep. Comrade Prosecutor! About the Mazurkiewicz warrant… He's got an unblemished reputation which you can't say about what's his name… Józef Dederko. Have you seen his file? It's not impossible that somebody else shot him and he's accusing Mazurkiewicz because he's got something to gain. That's possible Comrade Prosecutor and that's exactly why we need a warrant. Different times Lieutenant. We can't just bust in on someone without cause. Hi. Hi. Lieutenant, let's assume it's him. Do you think he keeps the gun under his pillow? Lieutenant, he has a lot of very influential friends. And what you have… is a load of shit. Are you saying that a man with a bullet in his head is a load of shit? I only said you need to sniff around some more. Keep me informed. Bye. Hi, do you have it? Wait. You promised you'd have it by today at the latest. Please, Władek I need this money. I'm sorry, it was supposed to be a surprise. What surprise? A present… an engagement present. Maybe you'll come with me to see it, I'm not sure if I chose well. ELEVATOR 1st FLOOR Good morning. Good morning. Good morning, Judge. Good morning. Your sister going on a date? With the Priest, maybe. She's going to vespers. Mazurkiewicz, Mazurkiewicz… Mazurkiewicz. Here. There was a case. Something rings a bell. Copy of marriage certificate, work reference, registration card, divorce decree. That's it? Antoni Bogucki and a catalogue number. Bring me this file. 3-57, 3-57… Here. Cause of death: gunshot to the head. And where are the case files? Looks like Major Olszowy has them. Colonel. Yes, Colonel. He was a Major then. Thank you. CITIZEN'S MILITIA HEADQUARTERS Thank you. Comrade Colonel. Come in, come in, don't be shy. Excuse me, just for a second, I need the files of Antoni Bogucki. You signed it out of archives. Bogucki? What's the case about? - Murder. - And when was this you say? In 1946. Nine years ago? Why would I still have it? - Then who might have them? - I don't know. Somebody lost them or they've gone missing… What we have here is one, huge mess. Did you see this? Sonofabitch. He's been mouthing off at Radio Free Europe for a year. So, I won't take any more of your time. Hold on. Where are you off to? Got a minute? How are you doing here, in Cracow? Well… Fine, you'll make a fully-fledged Cracovian yet. I remember when you were this small, like this. And now all I hear is praises. I knew you'd do well. PLEASE CALL Good morning. - Welcome, Comrade Colonel. - Good morning. What do you need? A carton of Chesterfields, Wawele… And what do you want with those old files? A certain Mazurkiewicz is connected to that case. "Lovely" Władek, really? Bely Aist, Ararat, two bottles each. Three Napoleons. Have you sniffed anything out about him yet? He's 43 years old, no record, not a Party member, divorced but still living with his wife. High school education, and for some reason, everybody calls him "Judge". Because he's a traffic accident magistrate, but that's only a cover. For what? Gold, dollars, shady business deals. He's clever enough to live well but not so clever to make a fortune. There's gambling too, he loses a lot. Canned ham, please. So, what is he suspected of? A murder. Murder? He hasn't the balls for it. - So what would you like? - I don't understand. Pick something out. You have a birthday in a few days. I want to get you a gift. Try it on. We'll take it. ELEVATOR 1st FLOOR Where have you been, I've been going crazy with… It's you? - Everything has to be hidden. - What's happened? Secret Police. They arrested a few of my friends for speculation. - Jadzia? - She's safe. But where is she? Zosia, there is no time. I'll take you to her. - Should I take everything? - Everything. Do I have to have this on? Relax, we're almost there. You can't tell the Police what you don't see. …in some way Right, this wine is really outstanding. - You still have a few bottles, right? - Of course, of course. May I? And this is for you. Thank you very much. Money doesn't buy happiness. Thank you very much. He's gone to a few joints, done some deals, the sonofabitch. He spent more today than I make in a year. Fuck… Even at night? They'll crap on us till death. Why do they always get me and not you? Maybe they can tell who is good and who is bad? One day, I will shoot them all, you'll see. You're off. Listen, I was thinking, lend me a hundred. You've had enough thinking for tonight. Welcome. Check your coat? No, thank you. You're most welcome. What'll you have, sir? Will you be ordering something? What do you recommend? And what do you feel like having? A cold appetizer, something hot? Maybe coffee and something sweet? Coffee and something sweet. What's best here? We have excellent pastries. That'll be fine. Cheesecake, apple pie, cream puff? - And you, what's your favorite? - Me? Vienna cheesecake and cream puff. I'll have that, please. Which one? Both. Diesel street, please. POLISH PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC CREATED BY HARDWORKING PEOPLE So what did you turn up? Nothing, comrade Major. Bogucki's files disappeared. So, comrade Major, all the more reason not to prosecute him. And especially after these revelations by Światło. When everyone is shouting about socialist law and order. And those missing female neighbors of his? The Police report states that he reported the missing women himself and besides, he took part in the search. As it turned out, the women defected to the West. With all due respect, these are rumors. Rumors? And what solid evidence do you have, Karski? - Mazurkiewicz is a profiteer. - A profiteer, you say. Suspicion of profiteering is a good cause for a search Isn't that right, comrade? Before the elections, all regional election committee protocols were prepared, with seals and signatures. A secretary and agent of security service was assigned. Her task was to bring original election protocols to us and replace tchem with falsified ones. It's for you. …the elections were exactly what the Party wanted. Hello? Yes, but what is this about? Fuck… LECTURES ON CHILDREN'S AND WOMAN'S FASHION We have the warrant. Search warrant. Where is Mazurkiewicz? There was a phone call, he had to leave suddenly. He didn't say who called and why he was in a hurry? Władek doesn't tell me about his business. Does he have someone? Do you mean a woman? Well, you do, doesn't he? How can you be so sure? Why did you divorce? Due to the ending of emotional and physical ties. It doesn't look that way. We remain friends. Does that surprise you? You know, you remind me of him. When he was younger, of course. And these neighbors who disappeared, what was your husband's connection with them? Connection… Well, Jadzia, after her husband took off, was hopeful. She invited him over for dinner, gave him things. And have you seen a weapon in his possession? But that's illegal. Besides, Władek wouldn't even hurt a fly. Władek's mother wanted a better life. She left when he was seven. He wrote her, begged her to return. But you know, she poisoned herself. He's Władek's. He's loved dogs since he was a child. Anything else? Yes, Vienna cheesecake and a cream puff. She's a honey, isn't she? A taste would be nice. Are you crazy? Trade in foreign currency. Three years in the joint or a tip-off about our mutual friend. Thank you. Where does he get his money? Beats me, but when they were liquidating the ghetto, he had a lot of gold. Where from? From Jews. And from Arnold, the head of the Gestapo, but you already know that. That's what you arrested him for after the war. Everyone thought he'd get the firing squad but they didn't touch a hair on his head. He got off free as a bird. - How did he get released? - What do you mean, how? You know how, he bought himself out with that gold. Besides, he's still paying people off. Who? That I don't know. But that "Lovely" Władek is untouchable everybody knows. Thank you. "Greetings from Zakopane, beautiful as always". The shithead isn't even pretending to hide. "I'm doing well, hope you are well too. Please have Gapcio bring me that sweater you gave me and long johns". Sonofabitch gave us the slip and went on vacation. The lover is bringing long johns to the husband. Do you understand any of this? That's exactly why I never got married. Broads are like pigeons. First they eat out of your hand, and then they shit on your head. That's him, go. I want you. You surprise me, is that a proposition? Speak Russian! Russian. We're cutting in. What did he do? Let him go! Private car, fancy clothes, lavish dinners. They pay you well at the Magistrate's Court? Do you know anybody who can make it on their salary? I do. I have to, he has to. And I don't. So where is it from? I play cards. Really, and who do you win so much from? It depends. And I think it's a lot simpler. You borrow or swindle some money from someone, like from Dederko, offer the deal of a lifetime and then… I don't know what you're talking about. Are you saying that Dederko shot himself in the head? He got drunk as a pig, went looking for whores. Then came back with his head busted. I don't know why he wants to frame me. Exactly. Why you? Listen, gentlemen, excuse me. If I was planning something, would I be seen with him in the open? Do you think I'm an idiot? I thought you were finished with these Gestapo tactics. He confessed? We need a search warrant for the garage he's renting. Fine, but find something this time or I'll have to release him. Lieutenant, do you think he buried that gun? Get out! Murderer! Do you recognize them? Your neighbors. Where are the other bodies? I didn't kill anyone. Take him away. What can I tell you? Congratulations. You were right. Thank you. So, comrade Major, we're closing the case? What do you mean closing the case? I think we have enough evidence to hang him. But there are more victims. A lot more. Karski, you just don't quit, do you? Get going, go. Would you like to be daddy? Daddy? Jojo's daddy. And who is Jojo? Ah, and what's your name? Ola. That's lovely. Hello then, Miss Ola. And hello to you, Mr. Jojo. Ola, how many times have I asked you… We're just talking. Miss Ola, Mr. Jojo, me and maybe you'll join us. Run along. Scram… I wanted to apologize for ordering something and running out that time. Will you order something? I'm here on official business this time. Please sit down. I'm here about your husband, Stanisław Niwiński. Can you tell me the circumstances of his disappearance? You have my testimony. Please, it's important. He was supposed to meet with someone. He was trying to stop the nationalization of this restaurant. It was his family's property. And who was he supposed to pay off? I reported him missing, they told me that he defected because he was afraid of being arrested as a profiteer. Does the name Mazurkiewicz mean anything to you? Was he supposed to meet with him? I'm sorry. It's me who's sorry. I didn't know you came here. Only on official business. So, do you want to be the daddy? Tadeusz Zomber, March of 1943, attempted poisoning. Irena Parafińska, May of 1943, in Zakopane, Helena's friend when she was still Mazurkiewicz's fiancé, disappears without a trace. Wiktor Zarzycki, December of 1943, arranges to buy dollars from Mazurkiewicz and disappears. Jan Brylski, July of 1945, same. Antoni Bogucki, October of 1945. The Suchowa sisters, May of 1955, Mazurkiewicz kills his neighbors and buries them in his own garage. September, he shoots Dederko. This is nine years between these two series of murders. What did "Lovely" Władek do during that time? Did he take a break? I don't think so. We are not interested in your speculations, Lieutenant. Facts. 67 names. People who disappeared in that time period in and around Cracow. Mostly profiteers and foreign currency speculators. We have a serial killer on our hands. - And on an unprecedented scale. - Things like that just don't happen. Not here, no way. And what do you think comrade Prosecutor? Well, it seems to me, that the whole hypothesis put forth by Lieutenant Karski here is based on the murder of the sisters: Zofia Suchowa and Jadwiga Suchowa and the attempted murder of Józef Dederko. But even these cases don't hold water. I ask again, where is the evidence? Where is the murder weapon? And most of all, where is the accused's confession? Where am I going to get that gun from? Put yourself in his situation. In his situation, I'd have thrown it in the Vistula River. Yeah? And if you hadn't? Why take such a risk? Why are you drinking so much? You know why? Because every morning I swallow a live toad so as not to feel disgusted with myself and the world. Then I have a bad taste, you know, so I have to keep rinsing my mouth. We'll make chicken soup. Boris, heel! There goes our chicken soup. Come here, look. Here, here. See what I have. Good dog, good… Come. Good… Good dog… Good doggy. Walther PPK, a real gem, but it doesn't match the bullets that are evidence in your investigation. You made a mistake. We test fired it many times. The result is unequivocal. And what the fuck is all this for? This is exactly why booze was invented. I told you to stop drinking. We can only accuse him of illegal possession of a firearm. Yeah, which neither killed the Suchowa sisters or shot Dederko. When will you finally get it? The real murderer is still free. Bullshit. It's him. I will have you taken off the investigation. And even Olszowy won't fucking help you. Your father and all your friends send greetings. Władek, everything will be alright. You have friends with influence. Look… they even arranged this visit, and they said it wasn't possible at first. How beautiful you are. Not so long ago was May, and we were so happy, we were smiling and tender, who can bring back those days… Good evening, what will it be this time? A double shot of vodka. How about Vienna cheesecake and a cream puff? No, a double shot of vodka. Or maybe two of them. Autumn roses, Sad tea roses, Autumn roses, Are like your beloved lips, Trees in crimson give us their last shelter, Our hearts beat in unison, Like bells. Autumn roses, whisper quietly of our parting, Autumn roses, tell us of our parting, Amid clouds of leaves, we walk through the silent park, Autumn roses, wilting away… So, the same, one more time. You should get going. Hey, I have money. Here you go. They don't give a shit and I keep telling them it's a serial killer. And they say: in socialist Poland? Please. Oh, how about a round? Come on, you've had enough. I'm coming. Let's go. Fine, hold on. How about you, Pajek? Who are you with? Who do you snitch to? I don't snitch to anyone. Tell me, who's protecting that sonofabitch? Let this case go, you hear me? Let it go, please. You can't win with them. Piss off. Adam! What am I charged with? When did you start working for the Americans? Before officer school or during? What are you laughing at, Karski? You fooled so many people, you even fooled Olszowy, but not me, comrade Karski. Luckily, we were able to unmask you. Actually, Sergeant Pajek did. Pajek? Pajek. We have witnesses of your altercation at Ballistics. The argument at the Astoria. You shot him in cold blood. Who? Fuck, cut the comedy act, Karski. Sergeant Pajek. You shot him with your own service pistol. The case is simple. You infiltrated the Police so you could create provocative investigations. We have to check all of them. Who knows how many innocent people you entangled in crimes they didn't commit? Who recruited you? Who, besides you, is part of the conspiracy? What conspiracy? Start talking you sonofabitch or I'll blow your head off like the other traitors who are now pushing up daisies. What did you give me? What the fuck did you give me? Excercise yard! They impounded your car and my jewelry. Don't worry, they'll return it. I'm scared. They keep calling all the time. Someone calls at night and doesn't say anything. Not a word. Who can that be? It's nothing. Did you hear? President Bierut died. - Władek, there will be an amnesty. - No politics! What, it's official now. That good changes are on the way. Mealtime. Inspection. Exit the cell. Inspection. Exit the cell. Exercise yard. Get your stuff. DISTRICT PRISON It took a while but I finally found them. Witnesses, they confirmed your innocence. And Pajek? Who killed him? We don't know that yet. We'll get the sonofabitch, you have my word. New people at the office now. As you can guess, it's about Mazurkiewicz. He flaunted his connections and ties to the Secret Police. Something like that puts the whole service in a bad light. Therefore we need to absolutely clarify it. Which is why, Lieutenant, you will finish your investigation. Nobody knows as much as you. Do you understand? We need to regain the trust of the people as soon as possible. Do you recognize it? It's your gun. In 1946 you used it to shoot Antoni Bogucki. The charges were dropped. Yeah, his files disappeared. But your luck ran out. Photos of bullets taken from his head remained in our files. As you can see, the bullet from Bogucki is an exact match with those taken out of the heads of the Suchowa sisters. And Dederko's head. After shooting Dederko, you had a gunsmith put new rifling on the barrel. You don't need to say anything. The Suchowa sisters were shot with this gun, your prints were on it. It's enough. I spoke with your wife. She asked me to give this. She's worried about you. Other than that, she looks great. She's a beautiful woman. Lieutenant Karski! Comrade Colonel. How are you doing? He's resisting, but I'm working on him. I'm counting on you Lieutenant. This is a priority case. We have to rid our ranks of degenerate individuals. If you encounter any problems, come straight to me. Yes, Sir, comrade Colonel. Good morning. Good morning. For you. Thank you, but… Thank you for your testimony, it helped me a lot. I only told the truth. Will you have something sweet with me? Please. They reinstated my investigation. I'll bring Mazurkiewicz to justice. You won't do a thing to him. You still don't trust me. It's nice here. - You've never been here before? - I was transferred only recently. No time for sightseeing. Why exactly did you join the Police? Or is that some sort of secret? No, but it's nothing exciting. I was the only one left of my family after the war and got sent to an orphanage. Then a Polish officer took me in, Major Olszowy. And thanks to him I got into the Police. I think it stopped raining. Poker is the art of bluffing. Well, there are different types of bluffing. Personally, rather than bluffing aggressively, I prefer the timid bluff. Pretending to have a weak hand, I pull others into the game and then I take the pot. But the most important thing in poker is knowing people. So what do you think about me? I don't know, a boy scout. You have to be a bit brazen in life. Anything else? There is a woman in your life, right? You dream of her but have no idea how to win her. And you won't, until you understand what she desires. And what does she desire? A woman desires to have a beautiful setting She wants to dress well, smell good. To have at her side, a man who has style, who'll take her to a good restaurant, who'll know what she wants at every moment. Can I give you some advice? There is an excellent tailor on Thomas Street. Excellent. Only that tie and the knot. A Windsor. Good for the office. And special occasions. Allow me. Tightly knotted. A well-tied knot can be undone witch one move. Your turn. We don't need his confession. We know why he killed. But he's acting like he's sure we can't touch a hair on his head. Are you suggesting someone is protecting him? Who? No, no, no. He won't avoid the noose. And what's with the circus with you and him, huh? Fancy dressing-up and card playing - what's that all about? I want to win his trust. What the fuck do you need his trust for? What difference does it make how many corpses we stick him with? It does to the families of the victims. You'll never close this case. He's playing with you. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And you're fucking around with those… Rumin is coming. Good morning comrade. Good morning. You were close. This was our last game. My superiors think I'm wasting my time with you. You'll be transferred to a more experienced detective. What else am I supposed to talk about? It's not about conversation. Then what is it about? I know what you are. You put a gun to someone's head and you decide life and death for some sick satisfaction. Who are you? God? What are you going on about? Can you afford to change someone's life? To give someone some happiness, freedom, a little luxury? Is this the sick satisfaction you're talking about? Then what is it, love? The three of you? You don't understand anything. So explain me. You helped the Krauts interrogate the detainees. I'll tell you what else you did. You were their informant. You found the ones who were in hiding for the Gestapo. No, I was a barber. Fuck, how I hate this job. But sometimes I get a cockroach like you and it makes some sense. No, no! Leave me alone, I have gold! Do you want to know anything else? Who called you? When? You went to Zakopane after that call. Nobody. I wanted to have a vacation. I like the mountains a lot. I got you on six murders, out of thirty six. I'll get you on the rest too. - What is this? - You're a murderer. A serial killer. Do you think you're any better? Like a dog, you serve those who kill thousands every day. I raise this toast to those, who did not for a moment doubt my innocence. Thank you from the bottom of my heart, friends. Comr… Comrades! To innocence! - Cheers! - Cheers! To your health Władek! Karski. I'll be right there. He won't let me touch him. He's threatening me with demotion and dismissal. - Get a car ready. - Yes, Sir. Comrade Colonel. Comrade Colonel. Fuck off, or I'll kill you. Car's ready. Comrade Colonel. We have a car. Yes, my boy, for you, anything. As you left your field, you saw a car stuck in a ditch, the driver stopped you and asked for help. He had blood on his hands and on his coat too. These are your words, correct? "I remembered his face and his car, I memorized the license plate number". That's what you testified at the station, but then you took it all back. Why? Do you realize what can happen to you for giving false testimony? Tell the truth, like at confession. If it was him, I'll cuff him and take him in myself. Are you sure? Maybe it was him. Or him? Sit, sit. What's going on with you? I haven't seen you lately. A lot of work, comrade Colonel. Thank you. Prosecutor Waśko is waiting for my report. Waśko is a prick. Boy, you're wasting yourself here. What would you say to transferring to us, to the Service? The Service is not like the Police, it's being part of a good, tightly-knit family. Thank you for the invitation comrade Colonel, but I have to… Fine, I understand. But give it some thought. I will think about it, of course. Get out please. I know you killed Pajek. I know you covered for Mazurkiewicz for years. He bought you like a whore. So what? Are you going to kill me? Arrest me? Let's go. Enough? Are you over it? At first, I thought they arrested him but they wouldn't accept a package or a letter. I knew then that he was dead. I went to Olszowy. He said they didn't have him so what did I want? I begged them to let me bury him. He said he'd try to help. Come see me next week. Maybe I'll know something. Enter. What we know is that he sent his driver away and disappeared. Gone underground. That's all we need, another Światło. Did he know a lot? I mean, what lies can he tell on Radio Free Europe? Well, too bad. We're closing the case. But you said you wanted to find out the truth. Don't get paranoid, Lieutenant. That arrangement of theirs was Olszowy's own initiative. You don't think that the entire Service could be behind that? - You have no evidence of that. - Of course not. The Service couldn't admit cooperating with the enemies of the State. Lieutenant Karski! Listen, there is this whore, a waitress at the Astoria. Olszowy was banging her. - Maybe she knows something. - I checked, she also disappeared. We're closing the case. The District Court of the City of Krakow finds the accused, Władysław Mazurkiewicz, son of Józef, guilty of all the deeds he stands accused of and sentences him to death, disenfranchisement of public ...and citizenship rights and the forfeiture of all property. ...and the forfeiture of all property. This isn't over yet. Sir, they didn't let me attend the execution. I can't help you. Are you feeling OK? He's different. You don't know him. Do you have any last words? See you soon, gentlemen. Execute. PLATFORM 1 Don't worry. It was made by professionals. Thank you.
