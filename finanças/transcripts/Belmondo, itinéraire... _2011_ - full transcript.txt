Let's go then serge alexandre financial advisor owner of a theater of a racing team sponsoring a press group not particularly beautiful I am a big boxer hello hello yes I am like that that the abou mzeirek art if you want to see me again, you can choose to send me a summons or the salad basket my respects at your place azad means free in a certain language projection if prices in 1960 a young actor passionate about theater and boxing became the symbol of the new wave in breathless this film alone will be enough for him to become famous all over the world but who is this atypical actor capable of intense dramatic force and daring comics pirouettes this man is jean paul belmondo in top of the record for forty years he shared with millions of spectators are pure happiness to play the comedy in turn cops to thugs crooks seducer with priests seducing disillusioned soldiers and modern jean valjean delusional guignolo or heir to a bank robber clown empire or worse to the desperate belmondo is the very essence of the acrobat a popular actor as free on the circus track as on a movie set or between ring strings when we talk about boxing on 2 jean paul and in essence because boxing a boxing fight is the metaphor of my life the bank could give precisely this side in one in life is good not to be taken apart when things go badly about boxing is suitable but I will go to sport in general because sport it's saint jacques a child when we played sport together they always a notion of competition in life also is to hang on when things are going badly and when we are a little desperate for vassalage continuity and I I think I learned that with boxing I think it was given to him really want to work to fight and jean paul is a boxer he has a boxer head is a boxer and he led his life like a world champion and he shows nothing every time to defend his title come on raymond comes taking the lesson really made it fast comedians like a boxer not first friendly meeting like that and not cinematographic cases of what happens passed in Saint-Germain-des-Prés surely 56 or 57 that's because there was a whole bunch of young people who wanted to start who were there who attended saint germain there was jean paul there was me there was jacques charrier there was laurent terzieff etc we were all a small family, it is under these circumstances that I have known we were oblivious to what theater was doing to him I came from nowhere and we were a bit like it happens and it's almost the cinema that came to us and not us who sought the cinema all left from there and that from that moment the godard of breathless and the clement which obviously full sun made that this was the birth of two between two stars 1 he if true to say ok francoise and capella month that she asked for a role which is engaged jean paul who is wanted jean paul domb wire to do belmondo delon in borsalino when you see alain jean paul going out blackcurrant water they are in their purest beauty in their thirties I always talked to me never two quiet minutes you're right they come to the blows that we could both do there same kind as the fish but in bigger explains polly what polish the butcher's shop I'm interested in the butcher's shop why i love butchers i'm sure you can see her polite like marc and the bone and men finished pushing and rocking were doing and I'm not interested is this time to explain a 7th toss it toss you lost you see your plans the story was beautiful and the ending could only be dramatically like her as she was and this death or short and fall into the arms and you see you see if rock luck it doesn't exist and dies and that's it formula louis roques I'm lucky I don't exist we are all nostalgic for this cinema, how do otherwise look at patrice leconte who has redone a chance in two quarters makes the pair and when he told us about a luck out of two go there we go and we left like crazy we each other delighted what do you see the pranks and prank accessories and I like to take advantage and it's my fault in the army we are sentimental done nowadays people have become so aggressive will come across wanting them soften up we follow each other when what mother is the devil if we do not arrive to be understood Yes the banks still know tenderly what is funny is that we told a lot of bullshit about delon and belmondo back in the days of borsalino who counted the close-ups to find out who had the most less frankly it is pipeau it maybe true formerly I make myself I witnessed a dune heard of something warm friendship between us but the fact remains that they are in their own way with all the friendship of the world which is sincere they are still in the competence ben yes that is to say that it is out of the question that one of the two is the Poulidor on the other, rather die a wonder than see them both together a real a very large very beautiful year sorting for the viewer for the average viewer 10 we were still very different from each other see what it means we do not double hang hanged each other we are good there had belmondo there were long and then there is no it is not the same approach at all cmc skywalker and dark vader i always said this anecdote game when the train arrives at the station and belmondo does not have his head in the window everyone is laughing the train arrives at the station and I think my head is head nobody laughs then the ladder if yes you will make him happy you will see it's his big thing that not everyone digging the eight years 1 young hopes I will take their time this scene was not planned in these wide and it is the idea of ​​belmondo who told me ah you still laugh at the end of the time in my life I have to do stunts, suggest something to me said long and in the helicopter he scale hymn the scales above the car and unfortunately all the same I have already done that finally good I moan like ah damn again the chains we will go up again and that's his idea does all his stunts all himself of course before him at the car h not how much their on the highway and go ahead, let me remind you of this one the land co-ops and we fly in the tunes no Armenian state it's more than you have I'm warning you it's the last you this is the last time it remains an unforgettable memory I think feel absolutely lucky to have been the one who was by his side by their sides to their reunion I got to know him because I was at the French comedy at this moment there I had just returned I was a boarder is really there house is elected rigid it's not very fun and therefore I had a small troop that was my pleasure so I said to a pupil of the conservatory can you bring me the crash of conservatory I wanted a good element is then the guy reminds me that who 16 he told me very opportunely he said yes the stage fright of the students or the crack of the teachers and I was great this by the geniuses the student crash and there I did not miss since I fell on the ace of aces on the flower flowers on belmondo see when i say go repeat i say no i can't and why you can not bad I was aggressive but because I turn and you turn what I don't shit it empty it has this laugh it the water event it you say no more but what are you releasing what's going through my head what's wrong, I'm looking at you at the end of the heat it was a beautiful breath when jean paul appeared in french cinemas that was dry fantastic sunshine because they were looked like nothing he had a boxer face everyone said what is it but what are the cases it is here in them e out of breath it was still me I saw three times in the same good week we are stuck that I came out convinced that we want to see a character an animal a human being an actor different from others is different from the generation that preceded him, i.e. he was the handsome kid who was not beautiful yet he was very good but he is a beauty contemporary I will put my poster of a bathroom I can call Yes that's not bad eh yes very good you like it's the plug not bad it's intriguing every month I told him a lot to turn this in a perfect conscience since he confessed to me Godard will wake up in the morning by Saying come on we were going surprise and fuck a dressing room I can go to bed late we'll see how lucky he is to be instinctive like that jean-paul he is totally of his time he has something of america so his quickdraw to say touch his lips the bogart the camera is in love with him said earlier to like that blais it is all there is when he has his young, young body sewing and there is a little through and tie in houndstooth and after all everyone tried to pump on him and dress like the i that's the phenomena that happen how to draw what they are who have these kinds of gifts of being when we pulled the future jean-paul hit them because they recognized a brother somewhere time later sigg mcqueen it's belmondo it's the same it's the same drunk animal and so many others but Jean-Paul in the same way to this animality it's natural it's natural extraordinary d annette if you don't have the sea if you don't have the mountain if you don't like the city fuck you it was him so crazy what godard aaa knew how to steal and knew how to steal what was jean paul what a gangster who had gone to the conservatory, it doesn't run in the streets auxerre it changed common in the conservatory hall i see marielle created mayor annie girardot claude rich and bengono and suddenly I saw it coming like a kind of nest artistic revolution with his six boys there but two years old when he arrived gave us a shot of terrible old he was completely completely reinvented which also reigns known sir yes when you see come people and keep your clothes on it feels good sir cadet sales show why covered with a big city of the lamp and me sir that I have my other thing all but from behind and that we see arriving in a spa and store it neatly on the side of the wall will always remind our professor georges roy whom he saw not sincere and he has 17 things magnificent which will be really and it immediately evokes belmondo il how they move it's up to males it was dancers this state it was a feline to the conservatives for fun and he was going completely down like that gore of stairs he must be any beginner cancer he was leaping but like a rubber ball he would be an eternal young man that's what I told myself he had such vitality such a mood it was it was a young lover entry he made the 400 strokes and climb to curtains it is the body we will serve it here it is that was a treat to see him vi jean paul belmondo demetrius to detectives private no horace mac near cannes said no jeff trotsky adventurers name jeff miller lawyer and yes how it is mister lying first scene please yes no it's not good it's good ball Walloon but no but no but no it's cabaret a cabaret cabaret work 1 and had made a very nice competition good pu his comrades we considered that he was not rewarded common should have be on time we carried it in triumph so there is a bronca in the public incredible several of us came back smoothed jean-paul on their shoulders offered a triumph and gave him an arm of honor to the eyes I heard talk about an arm of honor I don't know who did it but there was a arm of honor or he was not in good shape which may help him be able to remove his cold who showed him his cock which is possible in a way will be started well for him because that means he had the audience for us is that the piss-cold dre can go back to the locker room jean-paul all your comrades are there, well, a lot except michel standing and bruno cremer only bruno you left a letter that I could read dear jean-paul is not often too fast but sometimes not at his 50 years of career is really not much it's a little short young man djoko will be you you were even more handsome than jean glory teaser card one look like no one nor any criteria nor in this way of playing the comedy performed is a word that you are well in this art that you have common your pleasure for the great public happiness admits the bleating of water was done by itself you have it well deserved is the greatest gift than life could offer you to brossard and asus quickly there is hardly any training letter writer alain junior who will read me aloud but I hope he will have as much talent as you to pass all the styles friendship affection he walks between celine was not way who knows that I was cocquerez mer paris joy of yours coconut in italy in fact it seems that people naples and belgian because the beast because for them he had a face is not a face of a young first good my back and besides I think he even had at the beginning I think we got a little crazy there are people who if not a little plugged into it that they do not know if it's up to him when a teacher deserves them anyway you yourself won't hesitate the kind that will embrace the headlights at the end of the movie and yet they had no sex life with amateurs they were obliged to go see professionals also your servant dailleux what you cousin me a little with belmondo because belmondo scared the ladies physically he is stuck against the walls and then lift their skirt in their asking if she was going panties and bra but every time they gave a girl we hear screams of terror in the hall of the conservatory because he was messing around with such natural with such ease with such or such humor that the girls were 6 8 and we have it we apply some tips on the great months of May where I make myself cinema symbol ion he without camera bardot not want my star always you we want to know a lot of things about his past in which the vision can stop the women he met never dare to ask never never never and girls what did he do with crossing her the most sublime women for twenty years it is necessary to have approached to realize the charm of people love it because there are charms this is the little girl take two serpent for that he is he is the father was like that too was coal it's the charm he has the charm of two Italians also his in his beautiful bordeaux we are happy spouses that's good there are 10 o'clock in the morning this necklace was on the neck of a young woman from Angoulême in the hall of the Claridge at 5 o'clock in the afternoon I was in her bed chubby pretty skin pranks a little blunder at seven in the evening the pendant was in my pocket pay to move with it all the same not the eyes for the tenth of its price the chambermaids will come I saw very clearly that I was not his type of wife is perfect to shoot is better two comrades here it is and he is a man who could be a good comrade like that and so his charm I didn't care much I saw him I saw him on the screen there have been stories I am of history with more than one there was this one in almost is splendid it was magnificent seeking death beyond that would take first they worked 1 on your chest the common friborg he liked to seduce that for sure they had that fiery gaze when he told you look and it was clear and clean men and the kitchen that does yes and walk on the hands and dance on a wire and play the violin and train the flesh scream be you advise me to keep what this way of communicating also with the camera and all that is transformed very easily even though it looked like one but could become what they wanted what no yield you m you are young people but me I go down the stairs and there I see a bleeding man throwing his beautiful square shoulders and tanned I'm a pure know nothing and that's a lot and then me obviously girl a girl very very shy very very I had kissed the great star of French cinema that's true was doing something but it inhibited me a bit anyway it's nice to me made the raging leg for the wells and there it was funny he was too shy than me and she so suddenly our house was very hunting very modest redeems then good koup georges lautner is good then no my children to lennon haven is targeted yes go but here it is with all these encouragement circuit three times and after that it was very convincing and then there a very masculine figure that is that they do not play in the in the fop unreachable is untouchable jean paul jean paul he can be everyone world he can be the brother he can be the the father he little hasty the the son he can be the lover he can be he can be all these men there he releases is precisely something contradictory, that is to say a very great physical strength over animal like that has one side one little feline side and at the same time in my opinion a large fragility because of this modesty in the camps its touch and love when that touch and sex things like that so and all that I find that they see you I shoot every night including the Sunday for them it's you but I'll take you talking on taking them no i tell you how sorry I do not ask if if because the six caught talus such actress to not ask but I like to believe I have crossed paths is not part of our mythologies no of course pleasure to be together to have fun we laugh each other out like 3 3 kids we tell each other our thing our bullshit which filming late ago he's in he's alive he's more than alive jean paul he's like always always the eye which curls and me it is true that I am very happy to continue to see each other and there is a real bond of friendship since 94 that never broke today you see despite the glitches that is all there is no hard feelings there is no no negative there is nothing even today until the end, he will find there what is positive to eat in life, that's it her big secret her dirty kids redone shampoo it's a plant that rapunzel and on anything jean paul anything but really this ball of clown this energy this extraordinary vitality that his own he finds that the soil was wonderful so it gave from my back belmondo ya ben they had lunch together dined together and never spoke 6,9 and not by the football boxing and especially mello finally paul roll and by the mechanical it is very very modest in its small corner there is a small corner but as soon as he was in front of the camera for his something and that gabart felt deeply is obliged to take risks I hope that everything will go well I will put on my white suit, my one beginnings you remember this toledo novillada are getting cold what said 4th and this as long as they didn't want to die since I have stored more than 100 ch largest French matador gabriel fouquet gets drunk sahiouni do not interest you jean-paul behaved a little in all proportions guarded by the time we were turning 62 but a bit like a kid of twenty meters next to a poll is it in the eyes of kids there was that there had a kind of regret his youth probably good but it's true jean-paul were his 20 years tear me away and keep me but dragon the future paul belmondo i even think it was in boxing we were seated one next to the other by chance we shook hands because in this profession without knowing each other we know each other german pope and he told me bye-bye in one place of loan equal to the divine bald players of the executed evil far east and magnoler you have linares by the bull islero and this one I drink my jar of gideon fallen into the white trap agde to josélito the greatest of all there is a time gentlemen if it continues you go under the names we are in good shape that's why the rest of the search is clear she had to take me at the exit of the stops but I was above the goal wants more and she would already be there people train her georges laubry from cred goal of ilya during the scenes with gama in barbour and obviously it is a real shock for me to play the desire to play made me want to play what Did I not only want to play but to be his characters in the life and death at the alès claret moist barracks invited to occupy the blue room I touched my rear and this is the character of bebel is the character of kids in there it's mine I come from this cafe I talk about it when we see his face so we were talking in this scene in others we really have the impression that he is going to die Oh what maybe they build villas here with swimming pools its fragrance of change I will come back to see them are not there because he is nobody he is inside he is completely people who make a character it can't work when I shot with it belmondo and that he was very big stars at the time I said to myself how does he behave is he the master on the set or is he that he's a very obedient guy new republic he is an actor and he serves you 100% I say that if he is acquired what he is proposes he gives you 100% gift I myself remember jean-paul screwed up the spindle motor somewhere what was it here refocus three hours in advance it's not going it happened to me with jean pierre melville we were doing leon morin priest who were a little shocked by the way just before laughing before then they thought i was taking i did not take the role seriously which was entirely false jean-paul indeed to a playful nature he likes to laugh joking joke with his makeup artist charlie with hairdresser with extras with a supporting role who is a boyfriend got me drunk to relax this charity before when I was at freezing conservatory it's the same I had many complaints of the same and m he thought it was serious now leave me alone with that reasoning is time that with charlie and a few others here is some knight cut him cerium move stuff put them in front of my door i could not go out in the morning, that is to say that I always liked to do the stupid then it made that bullshit for two was heavy as we lived together with jean-paul it's not possible it's been saw the makeup artist with the actor his two friends I went with him since 1960 until yesterday how much five years later I did not leave 54 films due to the fact that jean paul carr ample 48 years of working together and 50 they designed it side him and help the actors of his generation like that but this kind of of gaiety of panache in what did not prevent them from being miral actors and do their job I remember fucking severe like a guy jean-paul in italy he's the boss he asked what is going to happen for his hotel he has everything jean-paul nothing stops him you remind me that they have set up a full room in the hotel lobby at night without anyone noticing I try to seduce the director of the hotel peacock of gold that to dismantle him the cart he had flanked a wardrobe ice in the elevator, that is to say that the person who opens the elevator suddenly find herself in front of herself finally good it's things like that did not take themselves seriously and they remained big children two boats two here is this desert I love this film tell you why because my children who hated all the movies I made when he was little all the scared sailboats have only one accused but it was place des bones he writhed with laughter every time I was told the scene where I was relieves after being seated and that I was especially able to reserve global vagina point la brévine for a good laugh jean paul and my father were really people who lived a movie together I said that there was a great camaraderie between them it was still also a few matches where I say it with the tenderness that I that I that I bears them year to year especially to my father but i but I was very aware of that so I said to myself, let's stay quiet work moselle bellecour gaby hosts would you have for at night an orphan are fake of course good evening banana you are going to sleep this is state michelot the state was going fend for yourself at at the time he made me feel most comfortable thinking when we started shooting or the first day of filming he said good we will spend we will spend a lot of time together you are going to be familiar with me right away so it's great because he there was not this report actors jean paul belmondo and this with this little kid there is more it is really immediately a report father son william havre took under his wing right away, most of them can be repeated cm1 the great star he was he was he was as aware as that could possibly bully seven children and is right away he has he has been he was tender kind protector so but that's how it is in life if not what do you think i am me how what kind of type i am according to you I don't know the adventurer type adventurer type and it is what an adventurer of artagnan euros per tonio euros is an adventurer is a guy who is only happy canteen in the hangars of the mountains so okay on an adventurer because they have but to ask again who has somewhere I can not resist I dive I was very jealous of the little one also put for the ace of aces because I wanted to be in his place I think I wanted of this little simoulin when jean-paul say that sir has he already slept in silk sheets he was unfolding the parachute you say there sleeping under the stars and jean paul belmondo and star fantasy for a young boy what you're awesome you will have to be a hero since it's jean paul is ultimately the last hero of French cinema but here is the problem it's good is that an adventurer it's not a dad you're stupid not because I'm an orphan who tells me that I was just explained like a man like a friend like a friend why i never had a joke when i was a kid it's true that belmondo was for me a kind of model that is to say that I told you wish later if i'm gonna look like somebody i wish i was that guy there it is both funny light but also extremely manly good it turns out that it's a bit messed up like this is life but if he is an influence among French actors the first one comes at night that's obvious Did you like women I do not know goes up what is it that my tooth digs not pile of seniors who left it's the first time that it happens to me when I pass a woman it was a time when is she i don't know how to spit them out absolutely find her wait i'm counting abroad in the pool bah it's a bit the upheaval of my life because the magnificent is because there it was mind blowing but what I love about this movie is that they were playing lives his life through a super hero who is bob sinclar me I dreamed of being a dj you travel around the world i tell myself it's funny already i love the name the name does not make this answer is a disco character and and i said wish me it's the same I'm in my little girl in my little teenage room I want to be a dj around the world good here I dream of that and maybe one day I will do like him so i will live my life so through through this movie and I too would like to become a super hero like Bob Sinclar and I found this name there so incredible so super star it's the movie of my life it's sure belmondo is an actor who makes me want to live doing when I see his films I want to be yes I want to be myself say ah yes that's it, life is slamming doors is jumping on a car is running over a train that's life I think the influential canvas jeans have always been a bit there but like all the guys in my generation and besides we make mistakes every time we talk about it actually de ventura blier jean paul obviously jean paul what this great freedom now as soon as a French actor makes three galy peace in a movie it's the new jean paul belmondo I had the right to this thing because at one point it was jugnot way chemical jugnot and said hey I did a somersault he did there bebel now there is play and it's bullshit it's a valve have done part of those children who definitely grew up under the influence by jean paul belmondo but in fact there is it's funny me i didn't realize how much I had been influenced by him in fact I realized this quite recently when I saw making-of images of him on a set his attitude this kind of casualness this kind of will not too seriously what meant why it was something that I had also developed from my side but I didn't realize that it came from him after all on high ideals jean paul has a brother alain and a sister muriel beautiful dancers all 3 adored their parents and they sleep between them etc there are really they are very good family is it also the origins Italian who plays a little bit I don't know maybe Jean Paul's game had an admiration in stern for paul for his huge father and at the death of his father he had only one idea is the museum the paul-belmondo museum in boulogne 1 the place where we are here is in fact the reproduction of my workshop. grandfather who has his followers besides because there is really the same principle a little of this mess that had in his workshop the tools right to left it is true that even his academician dress like that and that he was there also this important museum compared to what what my grandfather did of course is important for the family going on somewhere it's a transmission but it is true that this allows it to be shared with a greater number of people who will be able to discover it is not only inspectors was also someone who decimates is very very good and beyond that I also thought very important for my father because I felt that it was really something he cared about 1 e mo and he made a bust of me when I was 4 it's all done you've changed I changed a bit and after that I didn't it's not resting because a good month in the family we were like that get upset about posing because we had to stay wise during spend our lives fighting in sword fights in the tv we were young he was already playing comedy he brought together he brought us together he is already d comedy sessions with with friends over there and it is by staging them in spite of the streets of cyrano seeming to fear an opus that didn't know the lyrics it's house present for a long time that he talks about his already very very early in wanted to be like there are very early jallet 6 months the workshop that's why I had the idea to film workshops two films and the face to face between father and son a talent for many productions well yes by being an approach drawings watercolors and sculptures a structure an aura a little loose his daughter was moved by it rome I hear the time does not very often belong to the workshop produce anyway a long time later I can't be there every day of course no one will see my sons all the young people do not have every day but when they nevertheless appear the notion of having a different father it is a it's a mixture in fact child I knew it somewhere I greet you well since my father was known the girls the posters on the photos made but it seemed quite to me normal to say that for me it was a life here is even that saint denis like me I just wouldn't want my children to take a liking to luxury and not struggle in life and especially a boy my son I think as soon as he is old enough that they go to work by himself and not count and tell each other my case money and it doesn't matter that's very bad in life I'm a fat party having tantrums when we didn't say hello, it's things that are which seem like that harmless but later we realize this is the basis of life gala at hygiene and at the end of the dinner general approached handsome jean paul he took by the arm and taking him to the steps of the Elysée Apache is certainly impressive and wearing characters like that he spoke to us about cinema no he told me about my father some of them have faults because of faults the bep requested we are full of faults and he always wanted them without it not getting better a mayor there is that a very stubborn is excessively stubborn even if the rats are wrong so that was a quality too because i think that that stubborn side got him allowed to succeed in her life because she knows he will give precisely trust in there lets believe in him a little from time to time it is difficult will never say that he waits bardot and everyone was waiting for jean paul's tightrope walker number belmondo that was the highlight of the evening 2 he this movie is the amazing slow motion stunt and we see after the fall of two major schools will be launched around the Isère sun and the mother completely distraught she will leave us for possible he quoted a day in japan at best we made it drink come on we saw all the colors every time I made a movie she asked my father also besides asked if there were stunts in kills it was the first word out of print but why don't you do quiet movies again in this film it is certainly the first time that he has taken risks since when the bullfight scene does not cross all because william sends y to launch good cars and kin ball which stays on the trajectory and which let me approach them so will the cars which passed for the bullfight be at all made invent and give up did not hit his hand in a passing car I'm not 70 km to the east, we went quite quickly not even a little more and we did not read your cam heard a noise and we saw that they thicken when verna and cut out the good ones then its possibilities all because it is very worried the mails were facing chile 1-1 it's nothing but I still had a match g go combative yes always I think about school I fought the schoolyard a lot but for fun not so much by my chances i think jean paul was an excellent and who sport there it really does help channel the bump but I think it's 21 fights but I made four and we talked about it a woman I took good beatings and then certainly a little less I have not compared on the feet of the sticks or the pilots here it is not me who was looking I not looking for others but you makes races will surely pass from him but clearly he not in fact one of the beauties was fellah goalie and very chic very electric yes it is the flexibility of the body the elegance of the body it's not just flexibility not because you have athletes but it there is a kind of vulgarity in the muscle while he cccd the finesse and the elegance of style ccc 1 amazing but did by looking at these pictures does what comes to mind it's a tractor and take risks come out like that I knew he was a passionate I knew he did that he had been a little bit guarded I tell myself that if he had been there aim in the goal for brazil ever i would have scored both goals you i tell myself everything simply trashing the images but saw everything that physically touched all that he to transform in gold what I prick myself to run well enough I ran on the beaches of Hong kong every day the first days were behind me then after two weeks they were twenty meters in front of me and yes in business luckily there was nothing in there his egg race I really learned a large part of my job copying sending back inspiration from his of that let's say to probe its course and at the same time of its method its will so I don't need them we don't need to wonder about talking we are understood and that is what is great and I saw them make things and even saved situations which was genuinely said of a very very great hour kraska skimped on waterfalls also it is often me who moves them as I often want to go in the air very often for role-playing things and metro appearances on the second balloon you know 10 of course it's a question that arises and we sometimes wonder when we sees when paul belmondo take so many risks to do stunts Couldn't we rig his shots in the center without danger there is already many people also that he says to himself there must be something to her this is where we are safe and she scared and even bush m behind but my season otherwise answer wonders if you are afraid you hit me above hopes were bullshit here and all this after having grazed a plain put near avenches you have that pulse is still room and strong it was necessary a speed the sea was not easy and you had to genuinely jump the helicopter in the boat even extremely limited again it worked first But Loan the waterfall is a stupid trap and it was very hard because I was at good school I had you do stunts I had worked a lot with rémy julienne and we all knew stuff is there with my headband that leads is that we notice it that we know that it is him that we have a close-up of him when the car some in addition he cannot be attached cannot have a helmet it cannot be seen since it is he who led to it was no pie vias woven into that since I was in the guignolo we were in Venice I admit that I was still on the ass because the leak opted for it he hangs this guy who is not trained all the same thus of the panels this circus a type which makes the flying trapeze with enter the circuits we can but he and he leaves he flies suspended end said kopter he goes around venice suspended is not against the la the strength you need he was out of parliament they weren't attached to your call and fly over it to find and i did awesome stuff with him when i see the pics after the say shit how threatened anyway bullshit so been gentlemen let's see besson added with a friend one day we say it's hit the blow the action must be able to do it we stretched a rope from the top of my bedroom window in narbonne jardin with a com it is a reminder rope or was it that we had totally neglected with a rag soaked in oil with water point there for the padt hairs of sunflower I sprang from the window and the relaxed sursee coop So I finished a meter from the ground andro not in passing and sprayed cherry trees japanese who my father's pride with my brothers gille who was young and that he was worried about the kid doing dunks or videos m that at 50 or even 40 years old do not arrange how old he was to be able to touch kids this point there by its extraordinary vitality we could see someone who was the age of our parents and they have the puppet something apart from it encourages to grow old we do not know so serious to grow old we are not all in suits and ties with professions and worries of debts and divorces also be belmondo for example in the nina the insured of the poor who is thought of a helicopter on the wings in nyon and I was in the helicopter and it's a pretty big method we start writing lay people or and I have never been on the wings of the plane I said to myself and the coastal guys I saw stuntmen who have big reputations unpack on Thursday not afraid to say the word or never 007 there is always always always a risk that this time not to make a funny bullshit or after that there is always the risk of a glitch and that's why in any case what she was successful phew we were good happy the actors are people who have more love given than the others we all have need of love in given to receive it but the actors in proportions completely abnormal, that's why when there are people who are so happy theater 2 Yes we up to ain for historical monuments her daughter I don't know if the mother is alive but we were telling her we are suing her she we told him then what are we waiting for what you have you and also by compared to his father that he used to say when her that you really see the job are always perpetuated in jean-paul your real job is theater but it's not the cinema and when his son is playing at the theater he was a happy man he was a happy man I'm not to win is always knowingly lied who sees and what we cannot be and because we are tired of being what we are we play so as not to know each other because we know each other too well, hero france that we have peace cimpan sounded but jean reaches them when dreams of killing his next good morning arrange or because we like it truth because we hate it we play because we are a liar from birth we play we play because we would hold football I will not be I will play I know hence the moments when I would be what for me his return to the theater was something very important i just remember 2 of his anguish of someone really who was very worried and who surrendered bank accounts this havraise because my world which denies there really big movie star a number one in blockbusters as well as more so it's really a real challenge for him to go to the theater it's something they really wanted and it's true that today there when I saw the premiere of keane it was really very very very strong really very important it was for me I think the real discovery of his his talent the day of the last there was and the cheers of the precautionary cheers it lasts and we lasts and I endlessly the room began to sing it's only a goodbye it's difficult in the cinema in the joy that has just had tonight and I have some had many more in this room every night but it's finally this final I was not expecting this and there it returned me bedding yes alas he is there he is it is a blow his nights and conceive in the last row in the first row we have this kind of physical contact and I believe that wallace when he's a big movie star and people have seen him for ages years on a screen there is an even greater fascination to see finally in the flesh and we felt that very much in the rooms there Wasn't there belmondo in kin it is that he wants a belmondo is what I say lived he lived the roles and occident cyrano I remember it is a treat fascinated everyone on stage it's a little short in vain draft we say places of one of the things in short by varying the wrong for example year six months sir if I had internal and he would have to immediately that I want no later friendly but if you you europe and in your time to see fact that you manufacture to anna descriptive it is to these therapies title accor what am I saying it is a case it is a pinasse had it's what we really call an actor a great actor and humanly a type that exists to manage the a3 right why to you are you going both of you will play the comedy you need a blower priests and metals alone in front of him and you mister ki moon at the theater at the promoter my lord and well ladies and gentlemen if you don't mind that will be the last word but we have good memories at the cinema too then I was overjoyed to be professional with us because there is a memorable scene between the two of us wooded I told you that I will always be behind you I jeans sir not what is especially interesting and jean paul is the ease with which he moved from one to the other ok we could see it in fingers to tear off the uter and and we had as much of pleasure to see it at one or the other so that's quite unique with him there aren't many there aren't many actors who can be proud of having succeeded as well left wave with damask it is someone who has always had a normal behavior in his life not the remember seeing my father of course he was a star but on the drivers things like that which means that it is not the opinion of mister everyone but we went to the cinema we went to the acclimatization garden and all that normally with a bodyguard jean-paul in the street he does not behave as the star was pif it is the others who treat him like a star but he never used his passport our stars and this attitude there of course stands out on the personality I think it stands out on us too and stand out on people also because he had someone accessible he's a talking guy is my kehl language riding on subway roofs and who goes up on the church and along the gutters and who are you see is a accessible hero is a hero who looks like a daddy so it has to be it's touching you can not clear many antipathy on jean paul belmondo it's not possible there is no reason that's what gives off a generosity a swing and a pleasure of the game a pleasure to do a pleasure to tell the stories the lions if they feel you are scared and who can attack you but if you are not afraid it is in the heart have fear when jean-paul drawing in front of lyon it is lyon who steers away, it is the lion who smells the garlic has no special effects we can see they are going there I continue that's why this scene is beautiful that's why they ti neyret was so successful that it left an impression on people because behind the film hide scents of truth that the audience has felt deeply you know that your father and with the little one to track it gives no but this is surprising but it must not surprise you okay okay and imagine your father at the pump was auspicious this is how our example he's a man saying he's okay by then he has consulted with jean-paul we have want to take risks I want to take risks I would even be able today to go and find it again with the difficulties he knows he is going through and I will use his difficulties I will transform the cons into rich quality that I mean because that the next man says his last word yes I have known for a long time it was husband called her the lookout bernis and he tells me I have a small I have a small role for you of the account that tells you I am not law always says that it's a thing with so wade the world in lebanon yes I was objectively passionate michel serrault he was in an age jean-paul in another and michel was i remember michel telling me we waits for jean-paul anchored in the street and michel told me you won't believe me but I'm nervous, I sang and shot this stalking with him to turn with the moving uniqueness it's pretty in tractor anyway late and not a small ticket for a pot actors you need you are jean paul Barroso is about to throw the new specials into cash a few streets this quarterback was an actor and this after his actors his daughter swear to him that they have the ass that is interesting in the actors had to make portraits and to find the right sentences for each of them I I'm laughing I'm going to die badly he's going to die and he still says essential things and which are very beautiful fashions that I know I have never done shit nobody with my moods and never pissed off the world with my anxieties I had the delicacy to share to people they perfect synthesis of the character I never bothered people with my anxieties it's typical of belmondo sa grande force with great elegance and that pisses you off these guys who die in funny he would die because of me i did your ta ta ta any character and sums up the right on rue saint marc where it was vital to a director when we look at the face of jean paul today we have want to film it the camera end to rents what I would say related what how photogenic the living room is my back and a rock star in cap saint picq maybe not a peninsula but a capital actor look well so there is no roscoff what is it a race that the horoscope is the future I want to know the future patonia then the future cellar table we will give in - ladies 1st avenue I think that for all my generation our generation is from the father since an actor jean paul belmondo your mentors hoping to see you soon in marseille or madrid to keep a great match his panda clerk 60 countries I think there would not be two long are belmondo and maybe not feel everything made the same model mondo sense - there I love you
