(indistinct chatter in background) (upbeat drum music playing) (upbeat drum music continues) (train rumbles) (doorbell rings) (repeating) I'm not getting on the scale... I'm not getting on the scale. Christie: Did you get everything your father asked for? Sarah: Yes, Auntie Christie. Christie: Are you hungry? Sarah: No, thank you, Auntie Christie. It looks like you've been eating. Christie: I got some lye soup. Oh, Father God, we thank you for this soup. It's a wonderful soup, Lord, because it's you that has provided it. Father, we're so grateful, Father, we're so thankful onto you, Lord. Because every time that we need it, you never deny us. My Lord, it's only you who can provide this kind of soup. (speaks in foreign language) (continues speaking in foreign language) Christie: Thank you, Father, so much. We thank you. In Jesus' name we pray. Amen. - Amen. - Amen. Okay, I should get going. How much does it weigh? Sarah: You know, I didn't check, but I think it should be fine. Christie: Get on the scale. I hand you the bag. Get on it. Oh, I don't weigh myself. (tense drum music playing) Why not? (phone rings) Christie: Oh, this is your father calling now. (speaks in foreign language) (Jennifer laughs) (upbeat drum music) Sarah: Hi. Yeah. Yup. Auntie Christie has it. Because I gave it to her. No, no, Mom. No, I can't. I don't have time to do that. Work! I'm, like, working. Can't you just come to Manhattan? I don't... (sighs) No, I'm definitely not doing that. Because I can't. Salad. Mommy, I have to go. I have to go right now. Okay. I'm gonna go. I'm hanging up now. Okay, thank you. Bye. - Mothers, am I right? - You know. - You're so patient. - I don't feel patient. I usually tell mine she can just fuck right off. (Sarah laughs) - Is it your birthday? - What? Oh. (clears throat) - Wow! - Yeah. (chuckles) My students dropped it off this morning. That bitch Caitlin and her posse. - I like Caitlin. - She's a total savage. Oh, I don't mind that. And it's like, I'm sorry, sweetie, but we are too busy to grade your undergraduate midterms. We are in the lab trying to cure cancer. Well, not we. What? You said "we." I mean, you maybe don't have time to, but I make time. (knock on door) Lyle: Sarah, hey. The... Oh, hi. Hey, Emma, how are you? Didn't think you'd be here. It's my office. Yes. Happy birthday! It's not her birthday. I'm gonna send over the results of that DNA sample later today. There was a hold up at the lab. Okay. What time? I think about five, five-thirty. - Okay, great. - Okay. Hey, enjoy your special day, Emma. I think he's weirdly kind of into me. I can see that. Definitely. The two-bedroom, one and a half bath goes for how much? And the three-bed? Is that in dollars? Sorry. No, nothing, no. Ohio's a lot cheaper than New York. (gate buzzes) Okay, let me talk to my boy... my partner and I'll get back to you. But we definitely want to lock something in ASAP, 'cause he starts in six weeks, so... Okay, thank you so much. I'll give you a shout back tomorrow. - (gate buzzes) - Thanks, Lori. Okay, bye. You're early. Where's your key? (gate buzzes) ♪ Ooh-ooh ♪ ♪ Ooh-ooh ♪ (gasps) - (door slams) - Oh, shit! Sorry, I thought you were someone else! Caitlin: I'm just here to see the apartment. Just a minute. Hey, where are you? No, don't come up. Caitlin's here. Caitlin. She's your adviser. You're her adviser. Just come back in five minutes. Okay, bye. Heat, light, water's included. - Can't beat the price for location. - Caitlin: Totally. Oh, hey, so, Emma, Professor Jacobs gave us like an impossible problem set. I don't know why. She never grades 'em. Yeah. Okay. So, the yield is okay, but the cells aren't as activated. We're supposed to come up with three reasons why that might be. Do you have any ideas while I have you here? How bad do you want the apartment? (laughs) Um... very. Did you check your QPCR? Okay. Sorry. Can you just... - Okay. - RCG values? Okay. Your sample is probably too activated to start. I mean... - Amazing. Thank you so much! - You're welcome. So, any other questions or...? No. I think I'm good, yeah. Okay. Pretty interested or... - Yes. Yeah, bye! - You have my number, yeah? - Yeah. - Sorry about before. Caitlin: Oh, yeah, you look great. (Sarah laughs) Sarah: Did she see you? - Did she see you? - I see you. Oh, my God. That's not what I'm... (Sarah and Lyle laugh) Sarah: That's not what I'm asking! No, the door. (romantic music playing) (phone rings) Lyle: Hello? Yes. You know, I'm not sure. Can you call my wife? She should be with the kids right now. Or I'll ask her when I get home. (phone vibrates) Lyle: Yeah, yeah. Great, great, yes. She can confirm that. Yes. Okay, thanks. Hello. This is she. Excuse me? Lyle: Babe, hey, where's that hot sauce I love? No, there must be some sort of mistake. No, that's not possible. - It's not possible. - Lyle: Babe? (door slams) Hey, where... Sarah? Babe? My mom is dead. Sarah: And make sure she grades our papers on time, for Christ's sake. Otherwise, they're gonna want her head on a stake. Or her head on a cake. Because this cake... Sorry, it's corny. What about Ohio? Don't worry about it. Plenty of time. Not really. You start in six weeks. Okay, listen to me. Come, come on. Are you sure you're okay? Sure. I don't know. I don't know, maybe I'm in shock or something. - I don't know how I am. - Yeah. Listen, I want you to call me. All right? I know, but I want you to call me. You leave a message, I'll call you back. I want to hear from you right now, okay? You haven't even cried yet. There's too much to do. I mean, it's a one-week. - Lyle: What's a one week? - It's like a week or so out. There's like a little gathering, you know, before the funeral. - Like a wake? - Yeah. God, I gotta call her lawyer, I have to tell people. Lyle: Okay, okay, you will. Just breathe. I'm breathing, Lyle, I'm fucking breathing. Do I have to call my dad? Lyle: Oh, no. He's in Ghana. He's still technically her husband. I mean, even though I lived two completely different lives on two different continents. I do have to say, I kind of like that setup. I think I need to get "Ghanaian divorced." Then you gotta get "Ghanaian married" first. Someone might see. Call your dad, okay? What time is it in Accra? Accra, Accra! Lyle: (on phone) Hi, you have reached Dr. Lyle Commons. You can leave me a message. Sarah: (on phone) Hey, it's me. You told me to call, so this is me calling. I made it to the Bronx. It's weird being here. My dad is on the way. He asked for a copy of the death certificate so he could get a bereavement fare from the airline. He gets here tomorrow. And he gave me a whole list of people to call on my mom's side when... I don't know, it just feels like everyone should know already. I don't think I've told you about my mom's side. Have I ever told you about my mom's side? I mean, she doesn't even talk about her side of the family. Didn't. They're gonna ask for money. I just know it. Call me back when you can, if you can. I'd really love to hear your voice. (upbeat drum music playing) Christie: And Sam. And don't forget your Uncle Osei and your Auntie Acusia. Do you have your Auntie Mavis' number? Sarah: Who? Christie: Uncle Beko's older sister? Your mother was loved by many people. They just wanna say goodbye. I didn't know you loved my mother. I said a lot of people. No sister loves her brother's wife. (Sarah laughs) It's okay. (doorbell rings) (shuffling) (doorbell rings) (doorbell rings) - Hey, sorry about that. - $15.23. Okay. Oh, not that one. Hi, Aunt Diadra. It's Sarah. Yeah, Uncle Sammy. Yes, she had a will. An aneurysm. Very fast. Yes. On Wednesday. Like a wake. She was cremated. Yes, she had a will. Yeah, she had a will. Yes, she has a will. (upbeat music playing) God win: I lost my key. Sarah: She changed the locks anyway. Hi, Dad. I'm sorry, girl. Sarah: Me too. You're not sleeping in your bed? - No. - Why not? You'd be more comfortable. The Arsenal game. The TV in the other bedroom works. All right. We have a meeting with her attorney tomorrow. God win: I'm hungry. (upbeat music playing) (car engine roars) Raja: "The best interest of my estate are the beneficiaries thereof, I hereby sign 'Grace Sarah Obeng'." I'm sorry? Sarah, you are the owner of the house and the bookstore. But what about him? I don't want it. I live in Ghana. - But she was your wife. - She is your mother. Dad? Look, there must be some sort of mistake. I'm moving to Ohio. Why Ohio? Ohio is great. Have you been? Yes. Have you? Look, Mr. Singh, I can't run the bookstore. I have to sell. Well, your mother had employees. Well, she had an employee. Okay. So, I have to fire somebody? (car honks) (car alarm blares) (door slams) (rack squeaks) Man: Can I help you? Can I help you? I'm looking for Pitt. - How can I help you? - Excuse me? I am Pitt. I'm looking for Pitt. - I'm Pitt. - Wait, you work here? Say, Ma, this conversation's getting mad redundant. Sarah: How do you know my mom again? Pitt: I took a trip up north, and after I got parole, I needed a job. My grandmother knew your moms. She hooked it up. Uh-huh. She needed the help, your pop's bounced, and you was off being a student. A scientist. No shade, you just wasn't around. I mean, I'm forever grateful. She gave me a chance. I'd do anything for that woman. I'm sorry, shit just all fucked up right now, man. Pitt: I'ma close up shop tonight. - Sarah: Who opened? - I did. We do reorders on Wednesdays. Inventory is third Sunday of every month. Yeah, I know that. Okay. I guess I'll go get the deposits from the safe. Safe is that way, but we good. - I did the job yesterday. - You? You need a set of keys? I can make you a copy. Okay, you know what? I have keys. Sarah: Hey, Hezekiah. I am so sorry for your loss. Lean on God in this your time of need. - Oh, oh, okay. - Hey, original! - Hezekiah! - Hey, God win! Long lost, get over here! (Hezekiah laughs) What? Oh, we are hungry. What? Oh my God. Stop! (car honks) (Sarah coughs) God win: Sarah? - Sarah! - Sarah: Yeah, Dad? God win: Where's the remote? I can't find the remote. Sarah: It's right here. God win: Sarah! Yeah, Dad? God win: How do you turn on this thing? - It's the power button. - God win: Which one is that? It's the green button that says, "Power." God win: Sarah! Sarah! Sarah! - Yes, Dad? - God win: It's not working! Brothers, come take a look. I have good quality DVD here. Always gotta mess it up. So you were in school, right? You like school? Your mom's always told me you're a school person. - Sorta. - Sorta? Either you paying tuition or you not. Oh, I don't pay tuition. How are you not paying tuition? It's free? Well, I mean, I gotta teach. They don't pay me much, but yeah. So what you studying? I'm a molecular neuro-oncologist. - And that's free? - Yes, Pitt. That's crazy. - Man: What up, dawg? - Oh, yeah, what up, man? Chillin'? What's going on? - The cops had your Bible Bars. - Ooh, mad shit, man. Yeah, cops, that's what's up. How many you got? It's like seven in here. You get these, huh? Do your thing. Yeah, you don't have to rush. You can buy. You can come and look. Have you seen this one? Born-Again Billionaires. Good. Good, good, huh? Well, I'm here. You know I'm here, so... Marty: Hey, baby. What's up, Marty? - You get that book? - Yeah, I got the book. - Let me get a hug. - Yeah, let me get the book. - All right. - Hey now. Hi. Pitt: This is Sarah, Grace's daughter. I loved that woman. She did a lot for my family. I'm real sorry for your loss. Thank you. - It's $11.57, Marty. - Let me get a Bible Bar, too. Bible Bar, right there. - You're gonna charge me? - Yeah, I'ma charge you. This is business, Marty, come on. - I'll see you later. - Bye. - Wait, hold up, come here. - What? Where's your ring at? Baby, I told you I don't like to wear it at my job. Nah, that job gotta get, it's gettin' cut. No, it's not. We need that job. A degree costs money. But that molecular neuro-oncology is free. Sarah: That's not how it works. Sarah: What are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing? You don't live here anymore. You moved to Ghana. God win: What are your plans, eh? Why not go back? You can't stay here by yourself. You know I'm an adult, right? This house is for a family. Do you have a family? I have science. I'm a scientist. Oh, good. So you know how babies are made. You're still a child. The guest bathroom is filthy. (door slams) I'm the child you deserve. Oh, fuck! (car alarm blares) Sarah: Hey, it's me. I was just calling to see, you know, how everything's going. How she's, um, taking it. I hope everything's okay. The wake is tomorrow. (energetic drum music playing) I'm sorry, darling, but where is the body? Damn it, Earl, come over here! - So, where's your mother? - Pardon? Where's the body? - Well, Auntie... - Auntie Patience. She was cremated. In the box. - Hey. - She was cremated. (speaks in foreign language) (kids giggling) (speaks in foreign language) - Tanya: Oh, hey. - Hey. I'm sorry. I'm Tanya Thayer Malinova. - You're Bronx side too, right? - Right. Yeah, we live next door. - I'm so sorry. - Thank you. Well, this looks like a family affair. No, everyone's just black. Well, we just wanted to offer our condolences. (speaking in Russian) (speaking in Russian) Julia, what do we say? - Sorry. - Thanks, Julia. - Thanks for coming. - Yeah. (upbeat music playing) Nana Bempong wants to know when the traditional rites are going to be performed. - I don't know. - What do you mean? What do you mean? I thought you were organizing it. I'm going to Ohio. There has to be a traditional rites. I cannot organize it. I don't know your mother's friends. And why is that? - There's no body, no burial. - That's what she wanted. But there has to be something. (speaks in foreign language) - Someone brought it. - Please. Hezekiah: He's making a push. He's coming. Come on! You have to pass the ball! Oh my God! Wait, wait, wait, there's a strategy to this. I take back what I said. They're not doing that good. You watch. There is strategy to this, you'll see. Sarah, come on, please. You're right there. Move. This is something she does all the time. Yeah, but not now. She's just trying to get on my nerves, that's all. (speaks in foreign language) Go, baby, go, go! Get it, get it, get it! Yay! Kick it! No! Come on! - (God win laughs) - Their timing is off. You know, don't worry. You have to keep faith. They have to work like a team. You see what I mean? Wait, watch. Sarah: (on phone) Hi, it's me, trying you again. Like you said. I may have to stick around here for a while. My father says the elders are demanding final funeral rites for my mom. Which is like... is this even what she would have wanted? So I have to prepare this event. I gotta go to the butcher, which... Never mind. I'm gonna help with the funeral party, get the bookstore sold and then... Ohio. Call me back if you can. Vendor: Yeah! We starting off. Come on, don't be shy. Come in, come and buy. - Okay. - Thank you. - You want a bag? - No, I'm good. - Okay, cool. - Have a great day. - Enjoy your day. - Thank you. (speaking in Spanish) You like the fantasy movie? Huh?

Sarah: Did you like growing up here? Julia: I'm still growing up. Sarah: Right, right. You were born in...? - 2006. - Oh my God! I remember when you were born. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. It was like the event of Bronx side. Your dad's name is Dave? - Dan. - Dan. Still together? (laughs) I'm sorry. (laughs) Oh, okay. Yeah, no, no, they aren't. How are your fries? Genetically modified and mass produced. That's Russian for "delicious." (doorbell rings) Tanya: Oh, Christ. What'd she do? - Julia: Nothing! - Sarah: No, no, no, nothing. There were just some girls that ran after her. She ran to the store, these girls were chasing her and I just brought her home. - I got some food. - Thanks. Come in. Did you let those Jamaican hussies harass you again? Julia: They're Trinny. You know what? I'm calling that girl's mother. Julia: Mama, no. What did I tell you about standing up for yourself? You know what? We'll talk about this later when your dad gets here. Yes! All right, just get your things. - Come in. - Julia: Stop following me.

No, come in. I'll get you a nice cold drink. - I insist. - Sarah: Okay. What is a Kardashian? (exhales) (car engine roars) - Pitt: Shit. - You're using too much glue. That's why it keeps sliding off like that. Hold on. - All right. - Look at you. Where you learn all this shit from? Oh, you know, whenever somebody died, I'd help my mom out. You know how it is. Pitt: I don't. So, somebody dies and y'all throw a party? It's kind of like a wedding. - There's booze? - Oh, yeah. And they gotta give you gifts? Sarah: Well, you got to thank people for coming. Damn, let me find out I'm trying to die Ghanaian. (Sarah laughs) So, look, about the store... Pitt: I've been meaning to talk to you about that. Sarah: Oh, yeah? Pitt: I know what the store meant to your mother. Sarah: Yeah. And I know what your mother meant to me. She knew about my past. But what she also knew was that the man I was then, is not the man I am today. All I'm trying to say is that, whatever you need inside, outside the store, I got your back. Thank you, Pitt. You're welcome. But you had to tell me something? Um... Oh, nothing. I was just... I appreciate you, and all your hard work, so... Thank you. How this one look? It's perfect. Sarah: Did you want some of this? Tanya: Oh, sure. (speaks in Russian) - So, where is your husband? - (speaks in Russian) - Mom, please stop. - (speaks in Russian) (both speaking in Russian) She's been watching that show and now she thinks that anyone who's served in Afghanistan has been secretly turned Muslim.

Eric: What's in Iowa? My boyfriend just got a job there. Ohio. Eric: Oh, cool. Oh, sweet (speaks in Russian) No, don't touch it. Go get your own plate. It's in the microwave. Eric: All right. Let's go get some food for Daddy. Julia, phone! Cover up! So, what are you gonna do there? Like, he has a new job, but what are you doing? Oh, I guess I was just gonna finish my dissertation. Alice: And then we played tag, then Naked Cal held my heel. Eric: He did what? Ooh, let me at him.

(door chimes) We're here to see the property. Hi, now is not a really good time. - What property? - Estate Agent: This property. Real Estate Developer: We're opening a fusion bistro. Fuck. Pitt: I don't fucking believe this. Great. (God win laughs) Who the fuck is this? Hey, hey, Sarah, are you out of your mind? Sarah: Who the fuck are you? Maybe Mom put up with your bullshit, - but I'm not having it. - Hey, I am still your father! Really? Look, you don't remember your Auntie Gertrude? Auntie? I don't know this bitch. (slaps) - Sarah. - Get out! Hey! Sarah, no, no, no, no! - Sarah! - Get out of my house! (energetic drum music playing) (door creaks) - Julia. - Julia: What? Don't you "what" me. Open the door. Julia. (speaks in Russian) - Were you smoking? - No. - Sarah's bunking with you. - (scoffs) What are you still doing here anyway? This is not my ideal setup either. No, I mean, Tanya said you were leaving after your mom's funeral. Yeah, it hasn't happened yet. Yeah, it did. That was a white people funeral. We were the only white people there. The Ghanaian one is in a couple of days. Oh, okay. - Can you get that? Sorry. - Yeah. - What are you doing? - Made a nice cocktail. Isn't alcohol bad for babies? Well, it's not gonna kill them. It's just, you know, an eviction notice. Three of these in three hours and we'll have a baby and a bowel movement by sundown. Just tie your tubes, just slash and burn this. - Hey. - Hey. Julia: What's wrong with you? Oh, God. Is it time? I'm fine. I'm just hot. - Where'd you get that shirt? - Your closet. It's not like you fit into it, anyway. (Sarah laughs) What? Whoa, whoa! No, no, no! - No, no, no, no! - (speaks in Russian) Julia: I'm throwing them. Tanya: Eric! I bet you he's in that fucking man cave of his, doing God knows what! - Eric! - Are you sure he's even here? Yeah, where else would he be? Eric! That was faster than I thought. Girls! Tanya: Okay. No, no, no, don't panic. It's all fine. We just need to go. Yes, now! Sarah: A towel, or a napkin or a paper towel...? - Tanya: Snacks! - Okay, snacks. Julia: No, no, no, no. Tanya: Baby, call the doctor. Excellent. - Put it in the car. - Okay, yeah. Okay, okay. (indistinct, overlapping chatter) What? No, no, no... Sarah: Oh my God. It's not going with us. Eric: I swear to God, why are you putting... - Tanya: Oh, turn off the AC! - Julia: What are you looking for? - Sarah: Okay, the AC. - Eric: You got it? - Sarah: No. - Eric: I hate keys! - That's not it. - No, that's a bunny, baby. Keep looking. Little black keys. You know? Daddy's keys? They fall out on the couch. Check there. Tanya: Somebody turn off the AC. - Sarah: Okay, I will. - Alice: I found it! Sarah: That's not it. Alice: I found it! Eric: Yes, baby! Oh my God, you win the day. - Eric: Okay, let's go. - Sarah: Okay. Sarah: Bye, guys. Call me from the hospital. Let me know how everything goes. - Eric: You got it. - Okay. Bye. (door slams) Hey. (trash bag thuds) Listen. (door slams) (chickens clucking) - Hi, can I get one of those? - Yeah, sure. Small, though. For stew. Small, yeah. (rain pattering) (sighs) (energetic drum music playing) (drum music continues) (drum music continues) (drum music continues) (drum music continues) (drum music continues) (drum music ends) (TV commentary in Spanish) You want some tea? Okay. Let's see. We have peppermint, Assam, Oolong, Darjeeling... Lipton. Peppermint's nice. You remember when I broke my leg in the fourth grade, playing soccer? Tianna Washington slid into me and I just heard this horrible crack. And I'm laying there on the grass, in blinding pain... when all of a sudden... I feel these arms scoop me up. I didn't even know you were there. And you ran with me in your arms all the way into Montefiore ER. They wanted to wait for an ambulance. I could see the hospital right there. (Sarah laughs) (God win laughs) Dad? - (kettle whistles) - Hmm? (kettle whistles) Thank you. (clears throat) How about I make us something to eat? Rice and stew maybe? (laughs) That'll be just fine. (upbeat music playing) (upbeat music continues) Got any plans this weekend? Yeah. Hey, look, I'm sorry. Sarah: Yeah, no... Yeah, I know. I could put in a word with the new owners. Or call around at Columbia, you know? Maybe like, ask around. Anything I can do. I should've told you soon... Fucking right you should have. Standing here all day. Having full-blown conversations and you ain't say shit? - Yeah, I know. - Who does that? Sarah: Yeah, I know. I know. I'm not very good at being my mom. (loud thud) You don't have to be your mother. Shit, you don't even have to be the opposite of her. You get to define you, mama. Yeah, I know. I know. Pitt: You just can't use people and throw 'em away. It's a Christian bookstore, not a Walmart. (laughs) Yeah. Come here. Pitt: You gonna be alright. Yeah. (sniffles) - Come on, stop crying. - Okay. - Get back to work. - All right. - We're on the clock. - Okay. (door closes) (upbeat music playing) Looks good to me. I hope I did the right thing. Yeah, you did the right thing. There's no weed in those Bible Bars, right? No, there's no weed in those Bible Bars. (sighs) It's too late now. (upbeat music playing)
