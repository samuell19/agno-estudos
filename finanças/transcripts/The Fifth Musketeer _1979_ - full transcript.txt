Whoa, there! It does my heart good to see you. Good to see you too, d'Artagnan. I've a short time only. Oh, my chateau is very near. Good, let's go there. We received your message only yesterday, so it was impossible to welcome you as we would have liked. My visit was a secret-- Quite unofficial. D'Artagnan?Uh-huh. Who's that with him? I can't make out. But no matter. He is only one. There is still enough of us. Get the men armed and prepare the coach. Passing so close, it was a chance I couldn't miss... no matter what the risk. You'll be back with your party long before the sun's full up. No man the wiser. Tell me, d'Artagnan, how is the boy? The boy? Ah...! Come on! Again! Well done, boy! Oops! Ha-ha-ha! Eyes in your arse, boy. What did I tell you? You must have eyes in your arse. You're learning, my boy, but the trouble is, you still fight fair. We taught Philippe everything a gentleman of France should know. Huh. Swordsmanship before breakfast, and then Athos takes over with Greek and Latin. Colbert! An unexpected pleasure. Delighted to see you, Athos. Welcome. Thank you. Oh! And that, my dear boy, is sleight of hand. Now... If you ever use it in a game of cards, be sure to remember it in the discussions that may follow. Now, uh, would you like to learn that little maneuver? Huh? Show me. That is our godson, Philippe. Monsieur Colbert, an old and trusted friend. Aramis, Porthos. Aramis.Monsieur Colbert. I'm honored, monsieur. Philippe, why don't you go and tell our lovely Marianne that we're all dying of hunger, hm? And don't forget to give her a kiss from me. Marianne's our housekeeper. She was Philippe's nurse when we first brought him to this house. What do you think of him? Extraordinary. Absolutely extraordinary. D' So your negotiations with the Spanish court were successful? Completely. I have the agreement here. Now it remains only to persuade the king that a diplomatic marriage for the sake of France must come before his own... somewhat... eccentric preferences. Sooner you than I. Yes. Baron? Baron! Ah! Breakfast at last! What do you mean, "at last?" It's been ready and waiting. Good morning, Monsieur Colbert. Good morning. I have a great belief in the persuasive powers of the infanta's dowry. Six hundred thousand Spanish doubloons should prove a more effective advocate with Louis than I. The royal coffers are empty. Louis will accept this marriage even though he has no personal desire for it. My part would bring an end to these futile wars with Spain. Colbert! Quick! Quickly. I think we're in for trouble. No one must see you. Hold them off! Monsieurs, you disappoint me. I'd hoped you would have fought us at least a little sport before your surrender. Bring them out. Come on! Philippe, the swords! Ah! Come on. D' Halt! Halt! Stay back! Aha! Whoa! I'll get the horses. Colbert! Jump up!Right. The stairs, come on. The stairs! Hurry, hurry, hurry! Give me a hand with the door! Come on. Pull, pull! D' We're at the river now. Your party must be on the other side. Thanks, d'Artagnan.You'll be safe over there. Hmm. Drop your swords, gentlemen. No, don't! Not for me! And now the rest of you. Take them to the coach. How long do you think it'll be before we get there? The captain says we'll be there in two days. Your Highness is eager to see her new country? Not the country, Your Excellency, the man. You must admit that it's difficult to judge your future husband from an old miniature like this. Do you know what I think? I think you've deliberately kept any recent pictures from me. But Your Highness, why would I do that? So that I would not see what he has become. I assure you, His Majesty Louis of France is a most handsome and proper man. A most shameless and profligate one, and has many mistresses. Your Highness! It's also said that he's hated by all of the French people. Where can you have heard such lies? I have to marry and live with this unknown king. But if I cannot love him, I warn you now that, politics or not, there will be no marriage. Lower the gate! It's ready? Yes, sire. Bring him down. Commandant?Right. There you are, captain. That's for the man in the coach. Put it on his head. No one's to see. We're with you, boy. Come on... Move! Bring him inside. Where are you taking me? Get in there! Move on! Get rid of the escort. Sergeants! Come along, men. Get in line. Hurry along. Quickly! You'll be going home soon. No! No, no! Fire! Let go of my arm! Strap him in. What have I done? Tell me. Take them with you and wait outside. Oh, my God! You want your freedom, don't you? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah... What do you want from me? No! No! No! No, don't! No, please! Please, no! No! A copy to be given to His Majesty, and the original, return to me. Sire. It's done. And all who saw his face? They're dead. So my dear captain... that leaves only one person, aside from myself, who knows the face behind the iron mask. You. My lord? But of course, I can rely on your secrecy, captain. Rest assured, you need have no fear. Be back before nightfall. I shall have the deeds to your estate. You're a man of property now. Turnips and carrots here! Tell the king we're starving. Whore! Ha! You and your fine carriage! You'll finish up like me when the king's thrown you over! Drag the bitch out! There's your king, you whore! Get back to your sty, dirty bitch! That's how you'll both finish up. Madame...Monsieur Colbert. I would be in your debt if you would inform His Majesty I've been waiting for an audience for the last two hours. It's very important that I should speak to him. Perhaps, Mr. Colbert, you would care to inform me of your business with His Majesty, and I will pass it on to him. Madame is most kind, but it is vital that I speak to His Majesty...directly. No doubt it is. Then I will tell him. I'm sure he will be pleased to hear that you're waiting. And how is His Majesty feeling today? Oh. Does His Majesty wish for me to send for a physician? Perhaps His Majesty needs to bleed a little. No, no, no. His Majesty is right. What use is blood? Unless, perhaps, someone else's. Uh-huh. Which reminds me, Colbert is still waiting to talk to you about that Spanish upstart you're about to marry, I expect. No, no! No, no, no. I know you have to do it, Louis... but I will never let her have you. She will never love you as I do. Certainly not as I do. I am the only woman... that really loves you. And just one more, Your Majesty? There. There. Now you can continue to rob me with the seal of royal approval to protect you. My lord! Stop sputtering, Fouquet. I'm no fool. And I don't take you for one, either. Besides, with the state my finances are in... I can't afford to pay you anyway. My lord, I can only assure you-- Stop trying to look innocent! You haven't got the face for it. Anyway, it's the treasury you're robbing, not me. But you lay one finger on my Spanish money, and I'll have your head on a pike outside the Bastille! My love! Come, have a drink. You should be needing it after all that. And what a cure you are. Take care, my lord, or you may undo all the good we've done. Then I'll be ready for another cure all the sooner. Has Colbert got everything arranged for tomorrow? Everything, Your Majesty. I have all the details. I'm going to be assassinated tomorrow, my love, in full view of all Paris. It's all right. I won't even be there. But you just said-- Uh-uh! I'll explain it. As you know, there's been an attempt to organize a popular uprising against me... but I will show them the terrible power of God's anointed representative on earth, invested with all the might and majesty of heaven itself! Well, it's his idea. You! Tell her. Notice came to me of a young man in Gascogne who bore a remarkable physical similarity to the king. Tomorrow this young man will take His Majesty's place at the arrival of the infanta from Spain. I thought you'd like that. And there, he will be killed, by enemies of the crown. Handpicked by one of us, of course. But why should he agree to this? For his own well-being. And for the sake of his friends, whom we hold. And then, within an hour's time, I will reappear, unharmed. The king is dead! Long live the king! Miraculous proof of the king's divinity. After that, no mortal hand will ever dare challenge you. Oh, you will be a legend for all time. The bastards may not love me, but after this, they'll fear me! All right, young fellow. On your feet. Your ordeal is nearly over, monsieur. Just a few more minutes. Carefully! Come on! Come on! You must go now. I shall meet you at Fontainebleau in less than an hour. Take care not to be seen, my darling. Hurry. Tell me... is it considered proper in your godforsaken corner of the country to sit in the presence of your king? He doesn't seem to believe me. Tell him, Fouquet. You are in the presence of His Majesty Louis, king of France and Navarre. Up, peasant, up! I take it you've at least heard of me. I know you've come from the provinces, but you have heard of me? Indeed, sir. Who has not heard of Louis, King of France? That's a start, at least. Fouquet... the coat. Let's try it on him. Well, we might as well put an end to your curiosity. We. You know, Fouquet, this is the first time I've ever been able to use the royal "we" without feeling faintly ridiculous. We, my country friend, we two shall be one... at least for a day, which shall be quite sufficient. Oh, get on with it, Fouquet. You're the one to be explaining this, not me. You have been brought here in secrecy for a specific purpose. Tomorrow you are to double for your king. If you do exactly as instructed, you will be handsomely rewarded, and the musketeers released. But if not... Coachmen, forward! Come on, you rebels! Come on, come on! I want to hear you cheer! Come on, let's hear you! Louder, like loyal subjects. All hail King Louis! Come on, cheer! Cheer! You can't escape me! I think... We're alone now. Ah, those damn church bells. Their sound has always driven me mad. Louis, my love, how will you know when it's over? By keeping at least half an eye on Paris. Can you see him yet? No. Your Majesty. Give me your hand, idiot. Move. Your Majesty. If Your Majesty will permit, a few words in preparation? Your-- Your Majesty's... surprised by something? I never expected you so far from Gascogne, Monsieur Colbert. Philippe! You didn't know? I swear it. The musketeers? In the Bastille. The Bastille? I don't know the purpose for all this, but you may be in grave danger. Go carefully. Everything is, I trust, to His Majesty's satisfaction? Perfectly. He looks better than I'd hoped. Company... Fire! What's happened? Are you all right? The king, have you seen the king? No, sir. There he is, the king! The king! Oh, the king is safe! Go in! Come on, men, go in! Help the king. Keep back! Keep back! Behind you, Louis! Whoa! Louis, look! It's done! The king is safe.He's safe! Send in his coach. The musketeers. Use your power while you have it. Loyal friends... Loyal friends, we thank God for this deliverance... and we thank you for the welcome that you've shown our queen. To mark this day, let the order go forth, by royal decree, that the gates of the Bastille be opened! All held within its walls and incarcerated there be granted full pardon, and make free men of France once more! God bless you all! I expect you're more used to this sort of thing than I am. I feel I... I should apologize for what happened. Oh, please. I so happy Your Majesty is safe now. But who were those men that attacked you? Who? Those men. Oh, yes, uh, the men. I, uh... God knows. I confess, Your Majesty is not quite what I expected. No? Of course, I've had your picture, but a picture doesn't show everything about a man. It certainly doesn't. And naturally, I've heard certain things. Such as? Such as do not agree with what I see. You can be quite the diplomat when need be, can't you? Oh, you don't like that? If it pleases Your Majesty to think so. It's not a matter of "if it pleases His Majesty." I would only hope that your life here pleases you. I'm sure now that it will. And now, to celebrate my immortality... fireworks, a triumphant procession through the city! I am enjoying this! Whoa! Why are we slowing down? It's Fouquet. Your Majesty. Coachman, turn back! What's the meaning of this, Fouquet?! He's still alive. What? He's still alive. You've bungled it? You idiot! You idiot! Fouquet, how could you? D'Artagnan! Hurry, this masquerade cannot go on much longer. The boy's at the palace. Porthos, go back. We must persuade him to leave while there's still time. Glorious, isn't it? Yes, in this moment of triumph, don't forget your friends. They'll be waiting for you in a carriage. Hmm? Oh, yes. D'Artagnan? Yes, we meet again, Fouquet. It's been a long time. You remember Aramis? And Athos... And Porthos, of course. Oh... You gentlemen are free to leave. All of you. Take the impostor with you, and I guarantee your safety. We'll make sure of that! Here. He's coming. Let's go! Come along. Hurry! Forgive me, but something is troubling Your Majesty. Do you wish to tell me? I must go. I'm sorry. But, Louis, we've only-- Please... I must. Please promise me that you'll return soon. I promise. I will return. Hurry, boy. Hurry! Cover him! Fouquet? Fouquet... Are you there, Fouquet? My dear Fouquet. Everyone's been asking for you. I thought perhaps you were with the king discussing this eventful day. Oh, yes, of course. There. Where is he? The king? Well, at the moment, no one can find him. I mean d'Artagnan and his friends. The musketeers? Oh, were they here? This is not the time to play games, Colbert! They'll pay for this with their lives. Please make my excuses. I have to find my king. Wait outside, please. Sister Anne, you are summoned to Paris. You are released until your return from your vow of silence. May God be with you. Bernard! You're a welcome sight! You slept well, I hope. Well, we slept. But I'm afraid your accommodations aren't much better than the Bastille. Porthos, if you start on that now, you'll be blind drunk by midday and owing me a fortune by tonight. Well, how did he know it was me? How long do you need to stay this time? Oh, just the usual. Till things cool off a bit. Is it all of you in trouble, or just your young friend here? Who is he? Come on, Bernard, don't you know your own king when you see him? "Mind your own business, Bernard." Bernard, there's only one man knows where we are. If he comes here, he'll announce himself as Monsieur Guillaume. You may allow him down. And if anybody else comes asking? Throw him down! The only reason you still have a head on your shoulders, Fouquet, is because you're the one man capable of finding him, but your time is not unlimited. My men are everywhere. Your Majesty! Her Royal Highness, the infanta of Spain. Madame, how kind of you to attend us. Your Majesty. Please be seated. Your Majesty has recovered from the events of yesterday, may one hope? Thank you. We are quite ourselves again. Well... Time enough for these distractions later. The reason I wish to see you, apart from the pleasure of renewing our acquaintance, is this document. A mere formality, but requiring your signature. Fouquet? Fouquet, if you would be so kind. I can assure Your Highness it is all in order. You will forgive us, ma'am, we are not familiar with your native tongue. Your Majesty's pardon. I merely asked whether it was agreed my dowry be signed over before the marriage, and not, as is more customary, afterwards. Before, after... Is it of any importance? A matter of two days only. Surely, you cannot object. It merely seems, Your Majesty, that as there's no reason for unnatural haste, that-- Unnatural haste!? Perhaps, Your Majesty, it's only a matter of simple protocol. Wouldn't you agree, Fouquet? Perhaps, Your Majesty... Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps! You pair of parrots! It shall be as Your Highness pleases. We shall have the agreement drawn up afresh... after the ceremony. We thank you, ma'am, for your attendance. Your Majesty. Your Majesty, it might be as well if I... Yes, yes, yes. By all means. Go keep the witch happy! We can't afford a diplomatic incident at this stage, can we? What did that fool do yesterday? You don't think he told her anything? One can never quite be sure, Your Majesty. What? One can never quite be sure. Who is he?! My love... Thank God you're here! I'm being driven mad by half-wits and impostors. It was all to be so simple. He should have been dead. My poor Louis. Answer my question, Fouquet. Your Majesty, I have taken the liberty of bringing to court someone who can answer your questions better than I. If Your Majesty will accompany me? Very well, Fouquet. Let us listen to this informant of yours, and it had better be the full truth. Aramis, who am I? You! Your Majesty. Mother! He's my brother. It's true, Philippe. We were all there when d'Artagnan first brought you to Gascogne. Your father immediately saw the danger. Twin brothers, do you understand? Twin brothers as heirs to the throne of France? Impossible. Ambitious men have made civil wars for less reason than that. Well, why me? Why was I the one my father chose to send away? There was no choice, Philippe. Your father just picked up one of the babies, the one closest to him, and committed you to our protection. Then no one knows which of us was first-born. No one. It can't be true! Colbert and the musketeers were the only ones who had your father's confidence. I, myself, only discovered the truth two years ago. And yet you let him live?! He is your brother, Louis. You shall not harm him. Do you not know the invisible ties binding the lives of twins? By harming him, you would risk even greater danger to yourself. I shall not demand your word. For you have never felt obliged to keep it. But remember well my warning. It is the last thing you shall hear from me. There was no choice, d'Artagnan. Your own words. My brother was crowned, but there was no choice. For all we know, I might have been first-born. Are you saying that you would take the crown from him? Would I make France a worse king than Louis? No. You'd make a better king. On my honor, lad, you'd make a better king, but-- Mind you, that's not saying much. What's more, you're talking treason. That's true. Nasty thing, treason. Nasty. We want no part of that, do we? - Not I.- Risky business. Very. Beware delusions of grandeur, my liege. I'm afraid they're right, lad. Better to forget the whole matter. Back to the country, that's the life. Open skies, trees, the smell of new mol-- It's true, His Majesty has...many moods. Not all of them bad ones, I trust. Your Highness has her own experience that that is not the case. Monsieur Colbert, I did not trust you at first, but you are a kind man... in spite of the fact that for you this marriage is nothing more than a political convenience. Your Highness, please believe it is my deepest hope that it will prove much more than that. Thank you, Colbert. It's mine too. Oh, there's someone hunting! Aren't those the king's horses? Yes, I believe they are. Let's surprise him. I think it might be better to leave them to their sport. Oh, nonsense. If the king is enjoying himself, we may find his mood nearer to yesterday's than this morning's. I would like that, Colbert. I'll take your bird, ma'am. Here. My darling, what a wonder you are! The most beautiful woman in France, and still, you hunt better than any man I know. Dear God! Am I to be hounded like a criminal even here. Madame. You abuse the privilege of your freedom at our court. Privilege, Your Majesty? The infanta of Spain requires no privilege to move as she pleases. But we are sorry to have disturbed your...sport. Don't move. The thing won't attack unless you move. You'd better explain about Her Royal Highness' freedom. He doesn't seem to understand. Hie! Colbert. I suggest you conduct Her Royal Highness to the safety of her apartments. We shall talk later, ma'am. And you, Colbert, have done yourself no service this afternoon. The hunt shall continue. No, Colbert. Never, never, not for all the dead in Europe will I marry that man! Get out! Don't come back! Stranger, what is your business? Monsieur Bernard? Who wants him? My name is Monsieur Guillaume. Then you'll be looking for your friends. You'd better be quick, or they'll soon be gone. Colbert! If you have news, come with us. We're making a run for it. Where's Philippe? I'm right here. You know us, always the masters of disguise. Besides, Porthos had already emptied the barrel. Well, you aren't the only ones on the run. The infanta left Paris. There was nothing I could do. What happened? Oh, need you ask? Louis happened. You realize the consequences It means war and everything I've struggled to prevent. The princess must not leave France. I don't see what can we do. When the king finds out she is leaving... He'll send troops. That is why you must reach her first. How? We'll do it, d'Artagnan. But how? I can tell you where to find her. Where? Why, then all we need is horses. We're quite proud of these animals. Chantal, an excellent hunter. And... my spirited friend. Perhaps you'd like a closer look at this one. You appear to be a little nervous. With good reason. Your Majesty. I'm ambassador for the king of Spain. I'm... I'm protected by the crown. You're protected by nothing. Where is she?But no, I beg you! Please, no! Where is she?! Your Majesty, I beg you!Where? Tell me! Don't! No! No! No! Whoa! Whoa! Drop it!MARIE-Who are you? This is an outrage! I must talk to you. Trust me. How dare you stop my coach. You're in danger. Come with me. No! Please!I don't want to come. You must come!Soldiers! Don't be stupid! MARIE- No, no! D' Make her go. We'll try to cut them off! There's no time to talk now. I must take you to safety. I'm not going! You must! No, I'm not going. I'm sorry. We'll talk later.I hate you. Get them going! Hyah! Hyah! Into the woods! Come on! Force them to dismount. Stop! Stop in the name of the king! Right, then! Oh, no! No! She's not here! Shall we go after them? No. We've held them off long enough for Philippe to get away. What do we do now? The ladies. We can hardly abandon the ladies. The ladies! Of course, Aramis! I was raised in Gascogne under the care of d'Artagnan. I always believed that my father had been killed at his side. Little did I know that in Paris there was someone exactly my double-- The king of France. I swear to you, Louis and I are twin brothers. Philippe. I only found out myself this morning. Philippe. But what are we going to do now? Something... miraculous. Easy now. Careful. Mind the step. You all right? Bernard, listen. What? Careful, Bernard. Who's there? Shh. Quiet, Bernard. No one knows we're here, including you. But I thought-- Don't be stupid. Come on in. MARIE- I don't want you to go. It's late. We must be going. Stay. Stay here. No one knows that we're here. Please... Quickly! Come on. Oh! This time, there will be no escape. Surprised, Colbert? She's not under arrest, surely. Not under arrest, exactly, But she will not find it so easy to escape us again. Aren't you relieved, my dear Colbert? After all, it is your own diplomacy that I have rescued from the ashes. Together with her Spanish dowry, of course. Oh, of course. Twin benefits. Much to be desired, don't you agree? Forgive me. I have much to attend to. Monsieur. Uh, Your Highness? You will remain here. Your Highness, can I be of some service to you? You may step out of my way, if you please. May I ask Her Royal Highness where she is going? You may ask. The king does not wish to see you. Madame, you permit yourself great privileges for someone of such minor consequence. The king permits me great privileges. I suggest you remember that... Your Highness. I wish to see the Spanish ambassador immediately. I'm afraid that is impossible. How dare you tell me that! His Excellency has suffered a fatal accident. A riding accident. Very tragic. I find that hard to believe. The ambassador did not even ride. He was terrified of horses. Ah! Then perhaps it explains it. It explains that he was murdered! Guards! Escort Her Highness to her apartments. She is not well. Whatever you need, send word. It will be brought immediately. Get out. You have your orders. Get out! That was very unwise, Your Highness. You're not in your father's court now. Madame... you may have a high opinion of your influence here... but remember, it is I who am to become the queen of France tomorrow, and not you. Do you really think that will change anything? You're very young and very pretty, but very naive. And you, madame, for all your extra years, have remained extremely foolish if you think that my influence will not be felt. Your influence will be confined to whether that your peasant lover of yours merely rots to death in the Bastille, or is tortured till he screams for it. The thought seems to excite you, madame. I wonder why. A curious passion. Forgive me, but I must do my best to see that such a passion remains ungratified. Ah, Your Highness. It's good to see you safe. It would be better, I trust, to see me free. Monsieur, our orders are to accompany Her Highness to her apartments. Well, orders are not given to be ignored. May I suggest, may I walk with you to your apartments. I must confess, one of the many pleasures in Your Highness' company is the opportunity to practice your exquisite native tongue. You will recall, when I was in your father's court, I had some proficiency in Spanish. We can't let this happen and still call ourselves musketeers. Well, one of us has to say it. What do we do? Well... but frankly... You can tell us, at least. Well, it's based on what Philippe told us about his imprisonment last time. But it would depend entirely what she says she can do. I don't know. Then again, she's a very remarkable girl. All will be ready for Your Majesty's return tomorrow. Yes, be sure it is. I may be getting married, but I'll be damned if I'll miss a full day's hunting just for that. Who is it? My love, where are you? I thought you would be at Fontainebleau. I was just about-- How did you get in here? I walked. Are you alone? Ah, you mean my guards? Oh, but they're at their post, quite unaware of any deception. Oh, please, Your Majesty. I beg you. Just a few moments. Believe me, I have no wish to displease Your Majesty any further, but I have a gift. An heirloom of my family. There is a saying that the man who wears this at his wedding will be blessed by all he desires. It's exquisite, but-- Really, Your Majesty, it is the finest in Europe. I will wear it. Your Majesty is most gracious. I feel I've delayed Your Majesty too long. Excuse me. No, no, no. Wait. I only... What an extraordinary girl you are. Yesterday... Yes, yesterday. Yesterday, a man came to me in the image of my king. You were running away from me! Not from you. Just from my own fear that I could not be what Your Majesty desired. Not what I desired? No message, madame. Does madame wish me to send to the palace? No. The king will be here shortly. You may bring more champagne. I wish only to be your wife on whatever terms Your Majesty demands. And, uh... my brother. What are your feelings for him now? I feel nothing. Nothing at all. And yet you allowed him to make love to you, didn't you? But I thought it was you. How could I know it wasn't? You realize you've become party to a great secret. Its keeping worth more than the life of any man... or woman. Its keeping's worth everything to the queen of France. And his life? What would you give to save his life? Your Majesty asks me to bargain for the life of a man who has humiliated me? Come. Let us talk more about your loyalty. Shh. Easy. Easy, now. Careful! You go next, Porthos. I am going to my room... where I do not wish to be disturbed by anybody! My dear Colbert. How fortunate not to have missed you. We have an appointment, you and I, in the Bastille. Hurry! Come on, then. What shall we do now? Uh-huh. Don't be coy. We have plenty of time, Your Majesty. Well, then. We have all the time in the world. Be patient with me. I will make you the happiest... This is an outrage, Fouquet. Just a few questions you might care to answer, such as who you met this afternoon, and why? Quickly! Quickly! You did well, my dear. Yes, now it's our turn to take over. Athos, find some of his clothes. Allow me. Oh, we'll need some of your skill later, Aramis. I... I think I remember this from the old days. Aramis! You'd better go ahead and start on the lock. Athos, pass me the lantern. Rest a moment. We can use this. Uh-huh. Aramis! Philippe. So you really think you can help your young friend. Well, let us show him the impostor. Lower that light, Porthos. Ooh! Never mind, carry on. Stop worrying about your back. Go on! That's it. Easy, easy does it. You'll be all right. Careful, don't wake him! Philippe!The shirt, pass me the shirt. Come on! Let me help you. Come on. Go on. Go on. Hurry! Now let's see how Louis likes the mask. Put his arms in. Now the other. Closer. Let's leave it as we found it. Come on, my sweet. Come on. Somebody's coming! Aramis, we must go now. Go on! Go on. Give me that lamp. You can't fail us now. I've done it! Now, Monsieur Colbert. Shall we wake your young friend? Do you wish to speak to him? Quick! Up the stairs! Oh... My God! Let me out! I can't-- What is this? Where am I? Ow! I can't breathe! My God! Let me out! Let me out! May you and your king be damned in hell for this. Colbert!And may you and your pretender be there to greet us. Fouquet! Fouquet! It's me, the king! Fouquet, do you hear? Fouquet, it's me! I command you! It's the king. Let me out of here! Silence the prisoner. No, no! No! No! Come, enough of this foolishness. I think monsieur is in the mood to reconsider his position. We will talk later, Colbert. No! Fouquet, please! Oh, no! We bring orders from the governor. Hey! Let them pass. I don't understand this. Are you questioning the royal seal? But why you two? If the king tells us we're in command of the Bastille, we should argue? The keys. Not so fast. Porthos wishes to repay you for your past kindnesses. Yoh! Let's put him in here. No one will find him in this cell. Colbert! Colbert! Aramis. You found him? Oh, my God. It was the commandant. The fat musketeer and another one threw him into a cell. I saw it! You saw it? I swear! He's a prisoner in the Bastille. And the man in the iron mask? Fouquet! Where is the king? Louis is in the Bastille, it seems, and the pretender has gone to church. The others are at the church.
