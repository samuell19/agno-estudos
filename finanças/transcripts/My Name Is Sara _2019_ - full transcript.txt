A little more of that one and then move on. [Grisha] Okay, okay. I hear you. (Sara speaks foreign language) (Ivan hums melodically) (Ivan sighs) I'm looking for work. Huh. (sighs) You're not from around here? No. (rake clatters) Jew? No. Ah. (sighs) Wait there. (Grisha spits) (horse whinnies) (stomach grumbles) (bench creaks) (jug thuds) (sighs) I take you to my brother's, hm? They have two little kids and just got rid of their nanny. (somber music) (cow moos) (dog barks) (distant chatter) (children laugh) Whoa, whoa, whoa! (hay rustles) (children laugh) She's looking for work. No papers. What's your name? - Many a. - Many a what? Romanchuk. - Where are you from? - Korets. (Pavlo sighs) - A lot Jews in Korets. - I'm not. Get off the wagon! Jew earlobes. Make the sign of the cross. How old are you? 14. Why aren't you with your family? My mother died when I was 11. Last year, my father married a woman from Bogdanovka. She slapped me for nothing and then tell lies to him about me. In May, she had her own baby, and it got worse. Everything. (Nadya sighs) You want her or not? (Pavlo spits) No pay. Just food and a roof over your head. (fire crackles) You are lucky you showed up on Sunday. It's pork. You love pork or are you just hungry? Both. (boy chuckles) Too bad. It's the last of it. (water splashes) (dark orchestral music) (water splashes) Forgive me, Jesus, for thy dear son. The ill that I this day have done. Many a? Come in here. The ill that I this day have done. That with the word, myself, and thee, I... (suspenseful music) E'er I sleep. [Danylo] E'er I sleep. At peace may be. [Danylo] At peace may be. Now into bed. Many a too. (Sara kisses children) (door creaks) You sleep in the barn. (brooding orchestral music) (Step an giggles) (rope creaks) (rooster crows) (chickens cluck) (rooster crows) (door slams) (Sara sobs) (somber orchestral music) (distant rattling) (chain rattles) (water splashes) I'll do it. Many a? Clean yourself up. (door thuds) (sheep bleat) Germans came last month for our animals. I got word early, thank god, and hid our best stock in the forest. The rest I had to leave for those sons of bitches. (grunts) (Sara gasps) (blood splatters) (door creaks) (egg taps) (Danylo giggles) (boy and father laugh) Many a, Many a, save me! (Sara mimics plane engine) After you're finished, he's taking you to Korets to get your papers. All right. (mimics plane engine) (cart clunks rhythmically) [Pavlo] This will take us all day. I'm really sorry. I left in a hurry. [Pavlo] And what will you tell your father? I don't know. I'm worried. - About what? - He'll be angry. He might start trouble and not let me go back with you. (Pavlo grunts) (soldiers shout in German) (suspenseful music) (woman whines) (soldier speaks German) (soldier speak German) You know her? Of course not. But it's awful what's happening. (sighs) God help them. [Pavlo] Save your prayers. Have you no faith? Faith? It died with my first wife and daughter. What kind of girl leaves her own family, hm? (soldier shouts in German) I have no family. My mother was everything to me. (distant guns fire) (distant screams) What am I doing here? We will go another time. (soldier speaks German) (dog barks) (dog barks) (ducks quack) (cows moo) - What are you doing? - It's a waste of time. I can't lose the day for nothing. It's not nothing. Get her back to the wagon. Shut your mouth! I'm not talking about it. (chain rattles) (somber music) (birds tweet) (lively chatter) (soldiers laugh) How am I supposed to keep up with my quota when they took almost all my animals? Go cry to him and see if he gives a fuck. Starting next week, bring in four more sacks of wheat. Because I asked a question? You're not that important. It's for everyone. Now get the hell out of here! (Pavlo spits) [Woman] Come, come, we have potatoes. Potatoes for everybody. Go. Maybe we can make some money today. (sighs) The soldiers look like their pockets are full. Your little one's gotten so big. And already a devil. This is our new girl. So nice to meet you. I'm Vira Ivanenko. I'm Many a Romanchuk. Where are you from, Many a? Korets. Welcome. We can always use more bright young people. Please. Thank you. (Vira chuckles) (lively chatter) (soldier speaks German) (Pavlo speaks German) (soldier speaks German) (Pavlo speaks German) (soldier speaks German) I'll give you shit! Think you can rob us, you filthy Ukrainian? (murmuring in foreign language) You can take the whole basket. But ask anyone. My wife makes the best wheat loaves in the district. And next week, we won't be here. These will be the last you will ever eat. (soldier speaks German) Thank you. I need to see Katya's new baby before she leaves. We are still bidding. For god's sake, she's my best friend. 15 minutes. (tower bell tolls) (groans) Go find her. (tower bell tolls) (lively chatter) (man chants in foreign language) (distant giggles) (hatch squeaks) (suspenseful music) (Grisha breathes heavily) (Nadya gasps) Get out! Hey, hey. Hey. [Nadya] Damn it, Grisha. [Woman] I can't believe it's been three months. (Nadya scoffs) You're a smart girl. I could tell as soon as Ivan brought you. You just missed my friend Marina. She was here with her aunt who used to live in Korets and knew your family. They'll be back next week! That's wonderful. (Vira chuckles) (suspenseful music) (cart squeaks and rattles) (door creaks) (door slams) Six grams left. (sighs) Six grams till the end of this fucking war. Hear about the peasant girl in Morasivka? (Pavlo grunts) She picked up a coat left by one of the Jews, and found nine diamonds sewn inside the lining. (Pavlo scoffs) A drop in the bucket compared to what those parasites stole from us. (match strikes) (insect buzzes) (ax thuds) (ax thuds) You can't go to church like that. I don't wear this anymore. You can take up the hem. (ax thuds) (Pavlo sighs) (suspenseful music) (Pavlo whistles) That man respects nothing. (Pavlo sighs) Even on Sundays, he rolls in the dirt like a pig. (cart squeaks and rattles) (priest speaks foreign language) (congregation sings in foreign language) (priest speaks foreign language) (priest speaks foreign language) - Nadya. - Nadya. (speaks foreign language) (speaks foreign language) Many a. Many a. (speaks foreign language) (sheep and goats bleat) (thunder rumbles) (rain splashes) (barn door squeaks) (rustling) Who are you? [Girl] Vidya. Are you a Jew? (somber orchestral music) I'm just hungry. Wait up there. (strong wind blows) Thank you. (apple crunches) (apple crunches) Where are you from? Rivne. But I can't go back. I'm looking for somewhere to stay. I have gold coins. Don't show them. Not to anyone. They will know you're a Jew. I am not a Jew. Make the sign of the cross. Like this. Right, left. [Vidya] Oh, yeah. Can you say the "Hail Mary"? You have to know it. Say it after me. Mother of God and Virgin rejoice. Mother of God and Virgin rejoice. Mary full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Mary full of grace... (creaking) The Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou amongst women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb. Blessed is the... (thunder rumbles) (sighs) If you want to live, you have to learn it. But it will be all right. No one thinks I'm Jewish. No one. - Well, you can't stay here. I am Mirarra Dubner. I'm Many a Romanchuk. (sack thuds) (Pavlo grunts) (sack thuds) (stamp thuds) (Pavlo spits) (cart squeaks and rattles) Hey! Do you have time to see her? Just say hello. We are not here to visit. (suspenseful music) Marina! This is Many a. Thank you for coming. Aunt Kati! Aunt Kati! Mm? This is Many a Romanchuk from Korets! No. [Marina] She was only seven or eight when you left! She's changed! - Don't you remember- - Louder. Don't you remember? You made a doll's dress for my fifth birthday. No dress! No dress! I was much shorter then. No! She's getting worse and worse. She can't even be left alone anymore. I hoped she'd recognize your face. (suspenseful music) (tree creaks) (ominous tones) (Sara speaks foreign language) (Sara speaks foreign language) (Sara gasps) (birds tweet) (children giggle) How long was I asleep? I don't know. Let's play hide and seek! Hide and seek, hide and seek! Okay. Let's hide. One. Two. Three. (rhythmic thuds) (chickens cluck) Okay. It's starting to freeze at night. You can sleep in the house. (fire crackles) Many a? What were you saying when you fell asleep in the woods? (children mimic foreign language) (thud) I don't know. Sounds like Chinese. (Pavlo spits) (door creaks) (door slams) (eerie whispering tones) (fabric tears) (sighs) (somber orchestral music) (rope creaks) (door squeaks) (scraping) (crunching) (Pavlo sighs) The roof's leaking worse. Tomorrow I'm going to the sawmill to get new shingles. You should take the boys. You know how much they love it there. (strong wind blows) (snow crunches) (distant rattling) (muffled moans and grunts) (Nadya moans) (Grisha pants) [Pavlo] The Germans are surrounded in Stalingrad. It will be over for them soon. So the old goat at the sawmill has a radio? (Pavlo sighs) (Pavlo grunts) You'll see. The Germans will find it and kill him. (Pavlo sighs) Maybe the krauts aren't as clever as we think. (grunts) (grunts) (Nadya moans) (flames roar) (dog barks) (gun fires) (soldier speaks Russian) (Sara gasps) Get dressed! (soldier speaks Russian) (dog barks) (soldier speaks Russian) (soldier speaks Russian) (dog barks) (gun cocks) (gun fires) (Nadya gasps) (Step an sobs) (soldier speaks Russian) (boys sob) (soldier speaks Russian) Get inside. Go. Go, go! Go! (soldier speaks Russian) We've got only a root cellar. (soldier speaks Russian) We've got potatoes, carrots in bags. 40 kilos. You take every... (thuds) (soldier speaks Russian) (speaks Russian) (soldier speaks Russian) It's the truth! (soldier speaks Russian) (gun cocks) I'll take you! (soldier speaks Russian) (soldier speaks Russian) (soldier moans) (suspenseful music) (chickens cluck) (soldiers laugh) (soldier speaks Russian) (thud) (soldier grunts) (thuds) (chatter in Russian) (soldier whistles) (soldier speaks Russian) (soldier spits) (soldier speaks Russian) (chatter in Russian) (Nadya grunts) Come inside. In a minute. (slap) You had to open your mouth? I thought they were going to kill him. We didn't take you into our house to think. They were not going to kill him. They want to keep coming back for more food. I can't stand looking at your face. (ice cracks) (creaking) (trap clangs) (rabbit squeaks) (bones crack) This was a much kinder death. (flesh squelches) I don't like rabbit. (Pavlo chuckles) Learn to. I can't! Complain to Many a. (horse whinnies) (Pavlo sighs) It's Ivan. He can barely stand up. (muffled singing) (Ivan laughs) Your big brother strike gold. (laughs) Ah! But he doesn't forget his own blood. [Pavlo] Where did you get them? Where are you hiding your vodka, huh? Show some hospitality. Hah! (glass clinks) (laughs) (vodka splashes) (coins clink) (sighs) Where'd you get them? [Ivan] From the prettiest little Jew you've ever seen. (chuckles) (coughs) It wasn't easy getting into her, but, Christ, I have never had a better fuck. Boys, out. Out! You come to my house to talk like that in front of my children? Sorry there wasn't a piece left for you. But she... (laughs) "Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah!" (laughs) But she wouldn't stop squealing. (laughs) Hey, hey, hey, hey! - You sick son a bitch! (Ivan yells) (door slams) (horse snorts) Eh! (Pavlo breathes deeply) (somber piano music) (creaking) Excuse me. (water splashes) Do you know what's happening? I think so. It comes every month. Are you cramping? A little. This will help. When you're feeling better, we need more kindling. (strong wind blows) (somber music) (birds squawk) (Sara mimics gunfire) (Sara mimics gunfire) You got me. We've been searching for this for weeks. The idiot pilot couldn't locate our signal, so, he just dropped it and left. (gun cocks) I'm sorry about your dog. Why did he have to shoot her? Because he's a bastard. No one can stomach him. I don't care. I want to join you. (soldier chuckles) I don't think he would allow it. Ask him. There is talk he is leaving to organize another partisan unit. Maybe you can join them. Have you killed the Germans? How many? Not enough. The big one with the eye patch. He's a Jew? The Bear. His real name is Kapinski. But I'm afraid he's not going to be around much longer. Why not? His hatred is too strong. He takes too many risks. Are you a Jew, too? Do you have to be Jewish to hate Germans? It's not so easy to kill another human being. It must be. If it wasn't, why is the forest filled with so many dead bodies? (distant calls) There's the rest of my squad looking for the drop. You better go. [Soldier] Boris. Boris! (jaunty accordion music) - Welcome! - Welcome! [Step an] Grandpa! Whatever happened between you two is in the past. You don't know what he did. What he said in front of my children. I don't care. You are brothers. Pavlo! It's Malanka. A new year. Please. For me. (mother laughs) (feet stomp) (floor creaks) (Grisha clears his throat) With war all around us, we know this new year will bring times of pain and sorrow. So let us vow to savor all the more the special moments of joy... And pleasure. (group yells in foreign language) (jaunty accordion music) (Pavlo growls) (Nadya laughs) Let's get some fresh air, you and me. (muffled accordion music) Sit. Have you seen them together? Her and... My nephew. No. (glass clinks) Lie to me and I'll hang you by the feet and slit your throat. I've never seen them. Do you swear on the soul of your dead mother? I swear. (moans) (group cheers) Is this how your greet your Queen Malanka? With drunken insults? You will show my friends more respect, if you know what's good for you. (group cheers and applauds) And where is the Jew? (group chants "where is the Jew?") Here is the Jew! (group cheers and applauds) (creaking) (group cheers) (whispers) (Sara growls) (group laughs and cheers) Let's go! Let's go! (traditional folk music in foreign language) (group laughs) I bless this house with good health and prosperity. Happy new year! (hammering thuds) (bird squawks) (hammering thuds) (mouse squeaks) (mill churns) He asked me about you and Grisha, when we were at his parents' house. What did he wanna know? If I'd seen you with him. And what did you say? I said I didn't. You wouldn't lie to me? Ever? Everyone lies. Even Grisha? (sighs) Especially him. (muffled hammering thuds) (man chants in foreign language) [Priest] What are your sins, my child? Go on. I... I lied to the man who took me into his home and- And? What? Is that all? And I... In confession, you must open your heart completely. (man chants in foreign language) (soldier speaks German) (soldiers speaks German) (chatter in foreign language) (father speaks foreign language) (mother speaks foreign language) (Sara speaks foreign language) (mother speaks foreign language) (chatter in foreign language) (mother speaks foreign language) (Sara sobs) (mother speaks foreign language) (speaks foreign language) (sobs) (distant clinks) (door creaks) (door closes) (rabbit squeaks) (trap rattles) (rabbit squeaks) (rabbit squeaks) Go. (claps) (door creaks) (gasps) (door creaks) Don't think badly of me. She must have told you about me. And the girl before you. No. Then why are you scared of me? I'm not scared. Good. Don't let her get to you. She's jealous because you are prettier than she is. No, I'm not. I think you are. (door creaks) (door slams) (children giggle) What animal am I thinking of? A cow. Moo! No. An owl. Hoo, hoo! - An owl isn't an animal. - Yes, it is! - Many a, is it an- - Danylo, cover his eyes. (dark orchestral music) (rope creaks) (sighs) (chain squeaks) (cow moos) Are you all right? (water splashes) This will bring the fever down. What did you think when you saw them? Hanging. It was like an awful dream. (somber music) It didn't seem real. I'd do anything to protect my children. Anything. I'm not a Jew. (Nadya scoffs) I'll leave in the morning, if that's what you want. (Nadya chuckles) (somber music) Pavlo would have a fit. And that would hurt the boys too much. Did he try anything with you? No. My mother said I had to marry him when I turned 15. My father died, we were starving. And he had his own farm. You know nothing about me. I know you're as strong as he is. Absolutely not. The partisans are for men. Hardened men. Not girls like you. Do you think you could kill another human being? You wouldn't be capable of it. You don't know what I'm capable of. You are a Jew, aren't you? How do you know our prayers and rituals so well? My best friend in school begged me to stay when the Brits came in for religious class. We'd sat together since we were six. Your friend is Many a- - Romanchuk. - Romanchuk. Do you realize the danger you are bringing on the family? And those two little boys. That's why I have to join the resistance. You'd never survive, my child. I would. I have to. I promised my mother. God bless you, and you, my son. God bless you. It's Stepan's birthday. How old are you? Let me guess. 12? I am four. You are sure? (chuckles) Then God bless you, Step an, with health, long life and great happiness. God bless you. God bless you. (Pavlo hoots) (children scream and laugh) - Many a! - Many a! Come in! - Come in! I can't swim. [Pavlo] I'll hold you. Go ahead. (Pavlo giggles) Many a, come in! (Pavlo giggles) Come in! (Pavlo gasps) Come in! (group laughs) Relax. Relax. Trust me. Relax. Relax. (Sara pants) Trust me. (car approaches) Everyone out! (sheep bleat) (cows moo) (chickens cluck) No. No, please. No. I... I need my horse to finish plowing, please. If you approach me again, you'll be shot! No, no. (flask clangs) Sir. In case you are hungry, there is fresh bread and cheese and also a bottle of homemade vodka. I know, I know. We are not supposed to have it, but- Are you trying to bribe me? You miserable piece of shit. Put it in my car. (chickens cluck) (shouts in German) (cow moos) Thank you, sir. (soldier speaks German) Thank you. Thank you, sir. (cow moos) (car doors slam) (wind blows) (cow moos) This is insane! Go ask Ivan for his horses! I'm not crawling to him for anything. Why didn't the Germans take his animals? He was tipped off. I guess he didn't have time to tell his own brother, though. Enough! Many a, hit her. (slaps) Harder! Harder! (children cheer) Come on! Come on! - Go, Lula! - Come on, go! Go! (grunts) Go! (grunts) (cow moos) [Danylo] Lula, come on! Let's work. (Nadya sighs) (cow growls) (Nadya grunts) (cow moos) (wind blows) (cow growls) (grunts) Push! Come on! Come on, come on. (cow moans) Come on! (somber music) What? Come on. (grunts) (cow moans) (bucket clatters) (cow moans) Stupid animal. Stupid... (grunts) (chains rattle) This is never gonna work. (wood clacks) (Pavlo grunts) (Pavlo pants and grunts) (Pavlo yells) (Pavlo pants) (Pavlo pants) Many a! Water. It's late. I'm taking them to bed. We haven't finished. Are you coming back? ♪ Sleep, baby, I lullaby you ♪ ♪ If you sleep, I'll never leave you ♪ (Pavlo pants) ♪ But ♪ ♪ The stones I'll rub you, baby ♪ ♪ And to the sheep ♪ ♪ My feet will leave ♪ (thunder rumbles) ♪ I will who cure your little ♪ [Pavlo] Unhook it. ♪ On a green sprig of thou tree ♪ ♪ Wind ♪ ♪ Will blow and gently sway you ♪ ♪ And lullaby you ♪ ♪ To your sleep ♪ [Pavlo] Don't be afraid. I won't hurt you. (Nadya hums melodically) (door closes) (wood snaps) (wind blows) (Pavlo and Nadya pant) Before we plant... For good luck. Grisha should come over and... And fuck you right here. (chuckles) (Nadya yells) (thud) (Nadya grunts) Oh, you filthy, pathetic old man! (groans) [Sara] Let's go, come on. (Nadya grunts and yelps) (Nadya grunts) (somber music) (Nadya pants and grunts) (Nadya growls) (Pavlo screams) (thud) (body clunks) (steel scrapes rhythmically) (children laugh) At least your family's good for something. They are good for a lot of things. (steel scrapes rhythmically) (brooding orchestral music) (spits) (steel scrapes rhythmically) (muffled snores) (Ivan snores) (children laugh) (background chatter) Who did it? Who did it? Pavlo, you thought it was some kind of god damn joke? Have you gone crazy? What are you talking about? Uh-huh. It's just the kind of shit you'd pull. It was him. He did it. (Ivan scoffs) Whatever it was. (suspenseful music) Did you do this? Stop right there, you little cunt! You wanna die? Get a hold of yourself. What are you gonna do about her? What do you want me to do? Get rid of her. No. (Ivan sighs) Get in the wagon! You leave now, you get no help from any of us! What should I expect from a man who can't even control his own wife? (Pavlo sighs) (Pavlo grunts) (distant explosion roars) What was that? Shh. (distant explosions thump) Partisans. Look. (distant explosions roar) They are close. I hope they killed the Germans who stole our animals. They stole from us, too. (Sara gasps) The night... (somber music) In the barn? (inhales deeply) (footsteps recede) (suspenseful music) (soldier speaks German) (soldier yells in German) (soldier yells in German) (chatter in German) (yells in foreign language) (soldiers yell in German) Shh, shh, shh. (children sob) (soldier speaks German) (Step an sobs) (engines roar) (soldier yells in German) (dogs bark) (soldiers yell in German) Go, go, go, go. Mom! Dad! (soldiers yell in German) Ivan! (chaotic chatter and yelling) (soldier yells in German) (officer speaks German) Last night, an army checkpoint was attacked, and two of our soldiers killed. (officer speaks German) The Fuhrer, Adolf Hitler, has decreed that in all occupied territories, for every German soldier murdered by partisan bandits... (officer speaks German) 10 civilians shall be executed. (crowd yells and screams) (officer speaks German) (somber music) (crowd yells over each other) (soldiers yell in German) (mother screams) (crowd yells over each other) Come. (speaks German) (officer speaks German) (mother sobs) (somber music) (crowd chant in foreign language) (officer speaks German) (guns cock) (crowd chant in foreign language) (officer speaks German) (guns fire) (crowd wail and sob) (gun fires) (gun fires) (gun fires) (officer yells in German) (somber orchestral music) (crowd sobs) (birds tweet) (children laugh) (dog barks) [Danylo] Do you miss your brothers and sisters? I don't have any brothers or sisters. I've told you before. [Step an] But do you miss them? No, I don't miss them. What do you miss? I don't miss anything. (water splashes) (Pavlo clears his throat) I didn't want to say this in the house. She asks too many questions. What is it? The Americans and the British have landed in France, and the Russian army is closing in. Know what that means? Yes. There's something else, I never asked you about. That day in the field with you and Ivan... Was it because of what he did to the Jewish girl? (creaking) Yes. (somber music) (footsteps recede) (distant clacks) (rabbit squeaks) (suspenseful music) (rabbit squeaks) (thuds) (muffled squeaks) (distant chatter) (marching footsteps approach) (hushed chatter) (machine gun fires rapidly) (soldiers yell) (explosions roar) (plane engines roar) (explosions roar) (soldiers yell and scream) (machine gun fires rapidly) (soldiers yell) (plane engine roars) (tense music) (glass shatters) German soldiers.

(groans) (somber music) (distant plane engines roar) I'm Sara. My name is Sara Gralnik. I have to go home. To Korets? Is there anyone even left? Maybe a brother. It's not safe. Russians are bigger animals than Germans. I'll be fine. Goodbye, Danylo. [Danylo] So you do have brothers? Yes. Goodbye, Step an. Can you come back? Maybe. (birds tweet) (water splashes) (car approaches) (soldier speaks Russian) (soldier speaks Russian) (soldier laughs) Hey! Wait! Where are you going? (soldier yells in Russian) Please wait! I need help!
