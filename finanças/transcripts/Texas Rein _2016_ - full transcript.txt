(gentle music) (horses galloping) (dramatic music) (people clapping) (people cheering) (volley ball players cheering) - [Dana] You're good Cass get up. - [Male] 70, 70, 70. (people cheering) - Good game. - Yeah. Let's go back and celebrate. - I can't I've got Sam with me. - Dana can watch him. - Tonight. I've got a babysitter. - Enjoy the game. - Yeah, it's great exercise. - I wasn't talking about volley ball. - Yeah. I'm enjoying that game too. - We have all tried. But it looks like he has his eye on you. Rumor has it he's looking for a trophy wife. What aren't you telling me? - Hey, buddy. Looks like you got a full corral there. - Yep, just like grandpa's horse ranch. Except I need Hank. Best ranch dog on the planet. - He ask me to move in with him. - What, what are you waiting for? That gorgeous beach house. - I know it's just not that simple. - [Sam] Hey, mom we're going back to Texas for Christmas this year right. - We'll see. - That means no. - Hey, Sam. Let's go for a swim. - Okay, race you. - Looks like the kid's busy. Come up to the beach house. - His name is Sam remember. I just asked him to go for a swim. - Go I'll watch Sam. (cellphone ringing) - Hello. Mom. Wait slow down. - What, what is it? - I can't understand. Yeah, we'll be on the next plane. - The next plane what's going on? - It's my dad he's had a heart attack. Dana. Dana, come back bring Sam. - Look I'll go with you. Oh, wait I can't I've got a closing tomorrow. Why don't you just stay here see what happens? - It's my dad, Garrison. - What is it mom? - [Cassie] Pack up honey we have to go. - But mom. - It's your grandpa. We're going to Texas. - Yeah. - Cover my shifts. - Yes, yes, go, go. - [Garrison] I'll call you later. (gentle music) (people chatting) - Wow. - Yep, I'm home. - Even the taxi drivers are cowboys. - I'm guessing you're Sam. - Yep, and that's my mom. - I thought Guy was picking us up. - I was already at the hospital so I offered. Can I take this for you? - No thanks. I've been carrying my own baggage for years. - Suit yourself. How about you, Sam? You seem like a sensible kind of guy can I help you? - Yeah, sure thanks. - Let's go guys. I'm just over here. - Uh, where's your taxi? - I never said I was a taxi driver you did. I work for your dad. (engine revving) (country music) Oh, that's my jam right here. I'll just put your things in your dad's truck if that's okay with you. - Fine, that's fine. - He's on the third floor by the way just left off the elevator. - Thanks, mister. - Chase, Chase Eversoll. - Thanks, Mr. Chase. - You're sure welcome, Sam. Cassie. - This is from James. Now listen you who say today or tomorrow we will go to this or that city carry on business and make money. Why just do not even know what will happen tomorrow. What is your life? You are like a mist that appears for a little while and then vanishes. - Okay, well, that was sure uplifting. - Grandpa. - Sam be careful. - Well, there is my little mist right now. - Here come give your mama a hug. - How you doing daddy? - Well, according to Clara I shouldn't be planning for tomorrow. - Hush Marvin. Son, give your grandma a hug. I need one too. Oh, you feel so good. - Really dad how are you? - It was just my gallbladder. - Just your gallbladder. They had to take it out. It's not like it was a hangnail. - So it wasn't your heart then. - You sound disappointed. - No. - We just found out last night honey. - All things work together for good. - Really. I grabbed my son, got on a plane in the middle of the night. - I am sorry that I made you come all this way. - You're here now and that's good. Now where's Chase he's my ride home. - Who is this Chase guy anyway. He says he works for you. - You ready to go Aunt Clara? - Honey, I thought you forgot about me. - Going home soon, Marvin? - Tonight if they'll let me. I gotta visit with my grandson. - Let's see what the doctor says. - Before you know it you're gonna be eating brisket at the Summerville County Fair. - I don't know about that. He's gonna be on a special diet. - I bet Sam would love to see our little county fair. It's no big city amusement park but we got plenty of horses. - It's only a few weeks away. - We'll be long gone by then. - Let's go Aunt Clara I'm double parked. Marvin, ladies. Sam, keep a good eye out for a grandpa will you? - I will. - Just sad that's all. It takes a near death experience to bring you back home and now you're talking about leaving. - Hank and I are getting eggs. Come on Hank come on boy. - My job at the restaurant. - You can do so much more than waiting tables. You have a degree. - No, mama I can't. This is my life now. - Well, don't tell your daddy just yet. It's his first morning to come down and I don't want him to get all-- - Tell me what? - Hey honey look at you all dressed. Come on sit down. Casey pour your daddy a coffee. - [Cassie] Feeling better daddy? - Yeah. Tell me what? - Sam and I are flying out in the morning. I've got my job and his school's starting soon. So we're gonna-- - Waffles. There you go we're trying something new. They're made be quinoa because of your gallbladder. - I don't have a gallbladder. - Yeah, so that's what I mean. - We got schools here and we got restaurants too. - I have a life back there. - Waiting tables all hours of the night is no life for you nor Sam. - Daddy please don't start. - Look who I found stealing eggs. - Guy, oh my goodness look at you. It's so good to see you. I was hoping we'd get to see you before we left. Sam honey go wash up. Here sit down. So how's Jeff? - Great. He just finished vet school. He's coming back home to start a practice. - You're kidding me. I remember when me and that boy used to run around the pasture trying to rope calves with balling twine. - Look at you ladybug. You're just as pretty as you were when you were the reining queen at the Tri-County Fair. - Yeah, right. Have a waffle, Guy. They're made with quinoa. - I don't believe I will. - Y'all can make fun. But it's my job to keep my husband alive. - I will have some of that bacon though. Marvin, I did what you asked. He's in the barn. - Who's in the barn? - Splash. He's awesome mama. Guy says he's just like the horses you used to ride back in the day. - No, son he's better. - Daddy, I thought your riding days were over. - They are but yours aren't. - If you brought me back here. - I didn't fake my gallbladder, darling. It was just interesting timing that's all. This horse is special, Cassie. - That's what you always-- - I am right this time. Aren't you just a little curious? - Marvin, looks like he missed you. - How old is this horse? - Five. - Five isn't that a little old for a reiner? He's missed the fortuities. - Who said anything about fortuities? We're training him different thinking long term. - That doesn't sound like Cliff. Who you got training him? Alright bring him out. Let me take a look at him. Kind eyes. Nice deep chest. Clean legs too, but I don't see anything extraordinary. - It's also his breeding. He was sired by Commander Liam. - [Cassie] It's impressive but-- - He handles like no other horse I've ever been on, Cassie. And Chase Eversoll says that he-- - Chase Eversoll what does he have to do with this? That's who you have training him? Daddy, he's got you all worked up over nothing. I knew I didn't trust that man. - If you don't trust me you should trust your dad. He's got good instincts. He called you right too feisty and predictable. - What? Who do you think you are? - Well, Splash's trainer at least for now anyway. - Ugh, if that man tips his hat at me one more time. What about Cliff? He's the best trainer in East Texas. Have you even talked to him about Splash? - Well, maybe you and I should make a visit over to Cliff's. See what he has. - You do what you want. I have a job to get back to. - Oh, yeah slinging hash for customers or riding the championship quarter horse in the International Equestrian Games. - I do not sling hash. It is an elegant five star restaurant. The equestrian games. Since when is reining an IEG sport? - Since now. - I don't believe it. A western competition in the games. - Yes, and you're good enough to do it ladybug. - Me? - Yes. - Riding. - What do you think? - Well, I can't. - Chase thinks that a lighter rider with a lot of feel-- - Chase again. - Where are you going? - Calling Dana seeing if she can find someone to cover my shifts until I get back. Whoa. (doorbell ringing) - Leticia. Leticia the door. Well, hey y'all. Sorry Leticia usually gets the door for me. But come on in. It's so good to see y'all. Now Cliff's on a call and he'll be in in just a minute. Cassie, I swear my jaw just about dropped when Cliff told me you were back home. It's like a high school reunion. - Well, Sam and I are just back for a visit. We're just making sure daddy's okay. - Of course so you finally married that old Ronny, huh. - No, I never married him. He just left before Sam was born. - Oh. Oh, that's right. Well, anyway come on and sit down have a seat. So Cliff tells me that you're a cocktail waitress now. What happened to that college degree? - Oh, I got it. It's just that waiting tables pays more. - Oh, right a lot of men customers I bet. Now I was gonna have Leticia get us some sweet tea but I do not know where she is. Y'all go on and make yourselves comfortable. Leticia. Leticia. Leticia. Silly, y'all go on sit. Here we go. Now Leticia makes the best sweet tea in Texas. I don't mean to brag but it's true. I don't know what I would do without her. She practically raised our boys. - How many boys do you have? - Three and they are all just as handsome as Cliff. - Darling, you bragging on me again. - Well, honey I can't help myself. - Well, look at your Cassie girl. Come on up here. Oh, goodness you look just the same as high school. Doesn't she, Mandi. - Exactly the same. - Marvin, I'm glad you come to your senses. Now come on I'm a show you how a real training operation works. I got horses here from every big name ranch in Texas. The Rio Star, Sweet Briar Acres, Gun Smoke Diamonds. Hey, Tommy bring him on over here. Now you and Cassie are just like family which is why I'm considering training your horse. Now I don't mean to sound condescending but you're not my usual clientele. Hey, Tommy bring him on over here. Hop on off their, Tommy. I wanna show our friends how it's done. (dramatic music) - That was beautiful, Cliff. Really brings back memories. - Thank you, Cassie. Marvin, I know you have high hopes for your Splash. But training for the games that's a whole new world. I just don't wanna see you embarrass yourself that's all. - Impressive. We'll certainly keep you in mind, Kesterson. - Look, Marvin I offered my time here today to show you the facilities and give a demonstration. So if this is some sort of a game. - This is no game son. I got a lot invested in Splash. A lot of money, five years of-- - And that's another thing. I sure hope that Chase Eversoll hasn't ruined him. I not even sure I should take him on. To start with a five-year old. - Trials stipulate a horse's entry no sooner than six years. - [Cliff] I know that it's just that-- - Eversoll's been training him slow. Letting him go at his own pace. You ought to know better than anybody. A reining horse only has so many patterns in him over a lifetime. Well, let you know. Come on, Cassie. - Dad. Cliff, I'm sorry. I'll talk to him. He'll come around. - I just hope it's not too late. I'd be willing to take Splash on. Just as a favor to you. - We'll be in touch don't worry. Have you lost your mind? He just showed you everything you needed to see. - That horse was barely two years old. - Exactly. Imagine what he could do with a more seasons animal. - The horse moves like a robot. That's all horses are to Kesterson machines. - Daddy, you once told me that you'd only get back into it if you had a sure thing. If you really believe that Splash is a sure thing. - I thought you were a sure thing and look how that turned out. - You mean how I turned out. - I didn't mean. - Well, I'll sorry daddy. I'm sorry I couldn't stay your perfect little county fair queen. I grew up okay. I had a life to live. - Speeding off in that fast car with that boy Ronny was no life for you. You're here now, Cass. Stay and help me with all this. It's never too late to have your dreams. - My dreams. These are your dreams daddy not mine. - How'd it go? - Disaster. - I know must be a shock to see what Mandi did with your leftovers. - Hey, grandma Hanky and I wanna feed Splash. Can I have some carrots? - Sure in the door sweetie. - Hey, mom. - Hey, buddy. - Cliff Kesterson is not my leftovers. We never even dated. - Well, that's 'cause you never said yes. - Guess, you think my life's a train wreck too. - [Peggy] I was just teasing you about Cliff. He wasn't right for you. - You mean I wasn't good enough. - No, that is not what I mean. (gentle music) You are my baby, my only girl. You're daddy and I well we just had such high hopes for you that's all. - And I went and messed it all up. - Well, it's like Aunt Clara says. All things work together for good for those who love the Lord. - And are called according to his purpose. I know the scripture mama. I just don't buy it. - I know sometimes it's hard to see the end from the beginning. - It's okay mom. I really need a shower I'm gonna do that and I'll come back and help you with lunch okay. - Okay. Lord, I give it to you again. - Hey, there Sam. See you found yourself a new best friend. - He's awesome, Mr. Chase. Grandpa says he's gonna win the trial. - God willing we're sure gonna do everything we can to give him the best shot. You wanna help? - Yeah, what do you need sir. - Well, first thing any horse needs for a good workout other than the carrots is a good brushing. Hand me the curry comb we'll get started. - What kind of comb? - Okay, bud if you're gonna help me out you gotta learn the tools of the trade. Hand me that bucket right there. This right here is a curry come on. Now let's lead Splash out and I'll show you how to use it. Sound good? - Yep. - Hey. - Hey. Lunch is ready. - Isn't he something mama. - He sure is buddy? Now go wash up grandma's got lunch waiting. - [Sam] Awe, mom. - You heard your mama boy. - Okay. - Heard you went to visit that show boat Cliff. - He speaks highly of you as well. - Oh, I'm sure he does. - Well, I'm gonna go wash up for lunch. You joining us, Chase? - I gotta get on back. Listen it's good we're exercising her, but if we don't get a rider soon we're gonna lose some ground. - I know. - Why can't you ride him? - I could he's just used to your dad. I'm about 40 pounds heavier. We'd just have a better shot if we had a lighter rider. Why don't you come on out to my place and see the horses I train before you let Cliff ruin Splash. - Chase, it's nothing personal it's just that Cliff has a world class facility like no other around here. It's just that if a horse is gonna make it from East Texas to the equestrian games it'll be out of Cliff's barn. - Why don't you see what I'm about before you make a decision. - Okay. - Okay then good. Let's go Splash. - Now in the reining competition the most impressive move is the slide. So when we're in the equestrian games-- - If, don't you mean if? Thanks for lunch mama. Daddy, can I borrow the truck? - Where to? - Chase Eversoll's I promised I'd go by and check out his set up. - Can I come mama? - Well, come on. (gentle music) - I see what you're doing. Don't get her hopes up again. She's been through too much already. - This is Riata. - She's pretty. How old is she? - Three. Bought her off some guys selling some broad mares. Thought she might have some talent. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Easy girl, easy girl. - What's she scared off? - This is all new to her Sam. She's green. - That's right. We have to teach her to trust. Reining's about the horse and the rider moving together as one. Knowing each other's thoughts. Not forcing her into some cookie cutter program. - Is that what Cliff's doing? - It's not what I'm saying. But every horse is an individual. Relationships take time right, Cass? That's why this part Splash's training is so critical. Whoever rides him in the qualifying rounds will be the one to ride him in the games. - Aren't we getting a little ahead of ourselves? - [Leila] Hey. - Hey. - Sam, Cassie this is Leila. She's our Light Fair and State Fair champion. - Two years in a row. Got babies in the barn wanna see them? - Well, go on. Is that your daughter. - No, she's my assistant's niece. Her mom's divorced so she comes to Shawna a lot. - Hey, Chase you want me to walk her? - Here she is now. Shawna this is Cassie. Cassie, Shawna. Shawna's my training assistant. Most of my horses start with her until they're strong enough for more weight. - Yeah, I'm just his light weight. I'll take her and cool her down before we head out. - [Chase] Sounds good. - It's nice meeting you, Cassie. - Yeah, you too. - [Chase] So what do you think? - I don't know it's a lot to process. - No, it's actually pretty simple. Your dad just got out of the hospital. He's not up for riding so if you're as good as he says you are. - Wait how did we just get from you possibly training Splash to me riding him? - Your dad's been talking about you riding Splash all along. - What. How manipulative. I mean how selfish to think that I would. - Right your dad is so selfish. I mean to ask you to ride in the International Equestrian Games whew he's just a mean, mean man. - Mom. Leila says I can keep him. He's the runt too little to compete. Can I mom please? - No, Sam where would we keep him. Come on we gotta go. - But, mom. - I said no let's go. - She's mean. - Nah, she's not really mean. She's got a little fire in her belly. Come on let's go put him in the hunch. - I don't feel like going home just yet do you? You want a Coke? - Okay. (men grunting) (horse neighing) - Here this loser's all yours. I'm done with her. - Come on. - Looks like you're having a little trouble with her. - It's like she knows where she's going? - Where's she going - Auction at Knoxsworth. - This mare she's about to foal. - What's Knoxsworth? - It's a place that they buy horses and then sell them. - Never mind. (dramatic music) How much? - What? - How much do you think you can get for her? - Boss said not to take less than 250. - I'll give you 200. You can pocket the rest and save on gas. - The boss said. - You and I both know you're not gonna get more than 175 at auction. Suit yourself and you still have to load her. - How are you gonna load her? - Just follow us. Hey, grandpa. I'm gonna go get some more carrots. - I know, I know. It was impulsive, stupid, irresponsible. - So what'd you name her? - [Cassie] Bell. - Suits her. - I know. Can't believe she was on her way to that action and then off to some slaughterhouse in Mexico. - It's like she got mixed up with the wrong crowd. She got some scars. My guess is she wouldn't take the abuse. Got labeled for bad behavior that happens. - She just looked so scared. I didn't wanna leave her there. - So who's gonna look after her when you and Sam go back home? - I don't know I'll think of something. Dana's already called and left me three messages. - What are you gonna tell her? - I need a few more days to help sort things through. - I've already decided I'm sticking with Eversoll. I just trailered Splash on over. - I thought I was helping. - Don't worry you got your life to get back to. - I'm sorry daddy if I couldn't just drop. - It's okay I got it. - I don't think you should ride him. - Yeah, I know girl I'm too old. Chase is too big and you're too antsy to get back on. - Well, then who's gonna ride him? - [Marvin] Shawna. - Well, now wait a minute. - Hey, Guy. - Hey. - Jeff. No way look at you you're like a real man. - Yeah, last time I checked. - Hey, guys y'all pick me up at six you hear. - Yes, pop you already told me. - Peggy still has coffee. - Good. - I'm not finished with our conversation daddy. We'll talk latter. It's so good to see you. Guy told me that you're starting a practice. - Yeah, I'm just moving back in with pop till things get going, but I'll be doing ranch calls and fair reining competitions as a vet medic so that sort of thing. - That is so great. You know what I could use a vet's opinion right now. Come on. - [Jeff] What we got? - [Cassie] We got this horse. Take a look at her. - [Jeff] Yeah. - I kind of identify with her. - Well, sometimes the scars are on the outside. Sometimes they're on the inside. I imagine you both are gonna be all right. - You have grown up. - Well, you call me as soon as she shows any signs of labor. Because I imagine it's gonna be a rough one. - Is Bell okay? - Sam, hey this is Jeff. He's an old friend of mine. - Hey, Sam have you ever been to the Summerville County Fair before? - No, but I'd like to. - Well, you're in luck. It starts this Saturday with barrel racing and the reining competition. Why don't you and your mama come join me. - Can we mama please? - Well. - I'll take that as a yes. I'll pick you up Saturday night around six. And take a shower before then. You know put on some make up or something. Look like a girl. - Thanks, thanks a lot. (soft knocking on wall) Come in. Hey, daddy you look nice. Y'all coming tonight? - Yeah. It's what I wanted to tell you. Splash is competing. - In the county fair. Why? - Chase think they need more time in a competitive arena. Splash needs to trust Shawna sooner than later. - I can't imagine Cliff entering his hopefuls in the Summerville County Fair but whatever. - That there is the girl that should be riding Splash. But whatever. (lively music) - That brings back some memories don't it? - Oh, my. - [Tom] You said I could have ice cream. - You haven't had your dinner yet. - I wanna hold the money. - I'm the oldest. - Mandi's got her hands full. - Let's go have some fun come on. - Now wait a minute. - Ice cream now mama I'm being good. - Zip it. Zip, zip, zip it I mean it. My goodness. Okay, you know what here is a 20 for each of you. But that is it for the whole night. I don't want to hear another word and I do not want to see you again get out of my sight. Go, go. - [Jeff] Well, hey Mandi. - Hey, Jeff. Cassie. How long y'all been. - Those are some good lucking boys. You and Cliff sure know how to make them. - Yes, well. Well, it is hot out here isn't it? I'm gone get some lemonade see y'all. - Goodbye. - Look, look a ring toss come on. - [Male] Three tries you ring a bottle you get a prize. - Oh, so close. - Nice try buddy. - Things happen, Sam. Let's give it another shot. - Hey, Mr. Chase. Now you don't wanna go for the ones in the middle they bounce too much so stay to the side. Think up and over right. Up and over. - Up and over. Up and over. - Good job. - There you go. - Chase Eversoll this is Jeff. - Jeff Deavers you're Guy's son right. - Yep, I'm so proud of him. He's starting his own practice. - Well, if you're still taking on new clients I'd be interested in having you back at the farm. Absolutely be a pleasure. - Great. - I'm up right after this. Feel kind of silly competing at the county fair. - It's okay sweetie. It's just like we talked about remember. You do smaller circuits first. Then as soon as you're more comfortable on Splash we'll get you out on the bigger ones. - Hey, Sam you been to the large dunk tank yet? Well, come on. - Uh. - Don't worry I'll take good care of him. - I just wanna thank you Ms. Roberts forgiving me this chance. - Yeah, well if Chase thinks you're the gal for the job. - I mean the International Equestrian Games. I just don't know if I'm good enough. - That's nonsense alright you're willing. That's the most important thing. - Nice meeting you Jeff, Cassie. - Your proud of me. I'm touched. Girl you've got it bad you know that? - What are you talking about? - Let's get some ice cream. - [Announcer] Make sure y'all take sometime to visit the booths and support all our local vendors. - Good. Not as good as that old brisket you and Walt used to make at the restaurant though. - Mercy I haven't made that in years. - I miss old Walt. - Reining competition is next up folks. - Me too. - [Announcer] We've got some old favorites and some fresh new riders for you to view. - You okay? - [Announcer] There are 10 categories competing tonight. - Cassie. Hey, y'all. - [Announcer] Barrel race will be coming up next. - Isn't that cute? They were just friends in school but I'm hoping for more now. - I don't know Peggy. I don't see any sparks. - Stop your meddling. - Would it be so bad for our daughter to marry a doctor? - Shawna's up next. - [Announcer] And now for the Robert's Ranch. - See who's here? - Yep, I saw him. - She's one of our very own. Shawna, riding Splash. (crowd applauding) - How exquisite. - Splash does look impressive. - Who's talking about Splash. - She looks good. - She looks good with me in the practice ring but out there on her own I just... (crowd applauding) - Good for you. - He's got her number. She's asking for a love spin and he's saying no ma'am. (crowd murmuring) (dramatic music) Oh, this is bad. - We're not gonna place? - No. - Better go get her. - Yep. - Are you kidding me. - Hey, you too wonderful performance out there. - Why don't you shut it, Cliff. - If she does this good at the county fair I can't wait to see her at the Four-H Pony Show. - Alright, Cliff we get it. - [Mandi] Cliff honey. - By the way Cassie it's good having you home. You improve the view. - Don't you have somewhere to be? - Cliff. Cliff. - Coming. - What were you thinking? - Shawna's an incredible rider all right. Splash is a lot to handle. She just gets a bit nervous in front of a crowd. - Well, she'll do just fine at the games. Hardly anybody watches. - Did you see that? - Sparks. - The qualifying rounds are just a few months away. Cliff's already told you he's willing to ride Splash. - Don't you have a waitressing job to get back to. - Cliff is making you an incredible offer. I don't understand why you-- - Why do you think Cliff Kesterson showed up at the county fair to watch some rinky dink reiners? Splash is special. He knows it. I'm not gonna give up all our hard work just to turn him over to that. - Look mommy. - Y'all are gonna kill me. I told him I had a extra cage. - Just put in the barn with Bell. Mom's got breakfast ready. - I'm not hungry. - Whenever you would take the rein the whole stadium would go silent. They knew they were in for something special. They were right. Such confidence, poise for a young thing. You moved with the horse like you were flying on Pegasus smooth as glass. You never disappointed them and you never disappointed me either. My tough cow girl and sweet angel all in one and you still are. - Well, hey there cow girl. What do you think of my duds? - What in the world are you doing here? - You've put on some weight I like it. - Thanks. Where'd you get that hat? - Airport it was the biggest one they had and I just had to have it. - Put it on there. - So what are you doing here? - Dana was getting worried. A few days has turned into a few weeks. - Yeah, I know it's gotten complicated and my dad just-- - Dana said he was doing fine. In fact she thinks they might be keeping you here against your will. - Marvin, come take a look at this. - I've been helping my dad with our family business. - What's the family business. Tumble weed control. - It may not look like it now but this was once one of the premier horse breeding farms in East Texas. - Okay, calm down sweetie. You look so cute when you get frustrated. - Who's that disaster? - Garrison. Mom likes him I don't. - Is there anything I can do to help? - No. - Fixing things is my specialty. - No, we can manage. - I'm with you, Sam. - Hey, don't meddle. - I know you've had fun playing cow girl. But this isn't you anymore. Now come home with me. Move in with me. You, me, and the kid. - My son's name is Sam. - I know. - S-A-M. Garrison, I think you should go. - Now hang on a second I came all this way. - I think I'm more of a cow girl than I realized. - Cassie. - You heard the lady now get. Go on get. - Well, Dana was right. You people are crazy. - Okay. Time for breakfast. - I'm sure glad that fast car left without you in it this time. - Me too daddy. Me too. Call Chase tell him to bring Splash home. This cow girl feels like riding. (lively music) - They're here, they're here. - [Cassie] I wanna set up some ground rules. - Okay. - First of all, I saddle my own horse. Now I know that might sound a little snobbish but I like to make sure he's cinched up properly before I get on. Second, I've been riding since I was old enough to sit up there in the saddle so I doubt there's much you can tell me that I don't already know. Third, I know you and dad have been trying out this new training method and-- - Excuse me at what point do you actually get on the horse? - Now. - Lord, thanks for bringing Cassie around. We all know how hard headed she can be. - Daddy. - Seriously, Lord you know all our prayers all these years thanks for bringing them home amen. Clara, you know I love your baked apples. When are you gonna make some of that good old barbecue of Walt's. - I haven't smoked a brisket since we had the restaurant. - That was before I landed on your front porch that made your life crazy. - Honey you helped to keep me sane. - That sure was good brisket. - Oh, give it a rest Marvin. It don't matter now anyway. You can only eat like this on special occasions. - If have to eat more thing made with that quinowa I'm not gonna. - It's quinoa. - [Marvin] Whatever. - So Sam school starts tomorrow you excited? - No, I wanna stay here and help train Splash. - Next few months are gonna be brutal for Splash and your mama. Trust me school's gonna be much more fun. But I don't know anybody. All my friends are back in Virginia. - Oh, buddy. - What grade are you in now, Sam. - Fourth. - [Clara] That would make you 10 right? That is exactly the same age that Chase was when he came to live with me. - Tell you what, Sam. Why don't I swing by tomorrow morning and pick up you and your mama. Drop you off at school kind of like a first day celebration thing. - Really can we mama? - We're gonna be up early training anyway? - Okay, it's a plan. (kids chatting loudly) Have fun. - Why do I need to go to school? Everything I need to know is on grandpa's ranch. - Hey. - Hey. - We're in the same home room I already checked. - See you mom. - He's not gonna learn that on grandpa's ranch. - [Cassie] Uh, where are we going? - [Chase] Still early I wanna show you something. - [Cassie] Okay. (gentle music) - It's so beautiful isn't it? - [Cassie] I guess. - My Aunt Clara moved out here from Santa Fe. I came with her just to help her get settle in. I saw this place and it was so beautiful I couldn't leave. - Wait you lived in Santa Fe? - For a while. I was born in Dallas. - No way. I never figured you for a big city guy. Why in the world would you ever leave Dallas? - My mom and dad died in a car crash when I was 10. Aunt Clara took me in. - I'm so sorry, Chase. - For a while there I couldn't forgive them for leaving you know. Aunt Clara prayed with me every night but it didn't help. I was just too angry. Then one day I was sitting in church, and the preacher said something that just hit me. He said, "No condemnation for those who trust in Jesus." No condemnation. All this time I thought I was mad at them, but it was me. I realized I... I needed to forgive myself, They were coming to see me on my first reining competition. We got a lot of work to do. We should probably get on back. (dramatic music) - Is it dad? - No, it's Bell. She's starting to foal. Your daddy's in there with her. - Call Jeff. - I'm trying I can't reach him. - Foal's breached. Worries me she's so still. - Where is Jeff? - I'm gonna go call Guy's cell see if he knows where he is. - I should've checked on her this morning. - Cassie, stop. Just talk to her. - It's okay. Easy. - Easy girl. (dramatic music) One leg's out. Come on. Come on girl. You got it girl. Here we go, Cass. That's it girl. That's it. (gentle music) - Well, it looks like I'm too late to be the hero. - [Cassie] Shawna, what are you doing here? - Oh, well we were... - On a date. - [Marvin] What you gonna name her? - Me. I don't know how to. - Splash was born in a middle of a rain storm. His mama dropped him right in a puddle. That's how he got the name Splash. - This foal was born in a barn. Boring. - This foal beat the odds. It's alive and well because your mom thought it's mom needed a little help. A second chance. - Chance. - [Cassie] Chance it is then. - When can I ride Bell? - Let's give mama a little break. - Have to ease her into it buddy. She needs to know you're on her side. - Off to school guys. - Awe mom. - Come on kids I don't wanna get in trouble for making you late. - Have you good day. - You ready. - Let's do it. ♪ Everybody's got something they wanna run from ♪ ♪ Everybody's got something they wanna change ♪ ♪ Everybody's got something ♪ They wish they could be deep inside oh ♪ ♪ Everybody's got a dream they keep caged ♪ ♪ Well it's easy to breathe here on the ground ♪ ♪ With nothing to knock you upside down ♪ ♪ Where everything is safe and sound ♪ - We can get him moving right after the spoon. - I know you told me. - It's all at the speed, Cass. - I know. - Look you're doing great. - You're giving me instructions. Daddy's yelling stuff at me and it's just I'm tired. - Hey, you are a phenomenal rider. It's just qualifying is in less than a month. - I know. I just need a hot shower. - I better go. - Okay. - [Chase] I'll see you later. - [Cassie] See you. - Clara called. She wants you to come over for dinner. - Right now I'm a mess. - Well, she says it's important. - Make sure Sam does his homework. - I already did. - See Bell loves me. I think she'd let me ride her. - You heard your mom Sam. - My mom's too busy. I don't she has time to help me. - She's training for the Equestrian Games, Sam. It's a big deal. - Yeah, I know. - Ms. Clara you here? Am I eating alone? - I ate so much of it while I was cooking. I can't eat another bite. Take a bite. - Oh, is this it the brisket. - I'm doing a new thing. - Excuse me. - When I wake up this morning that was the scripture I came across. I knew it was time. - For brisket? - I never lost that recipe. Walt died right before Chase came to live with me. No, no keep eating. I was missing Walt so much I had to close down the restaurant and I had to be there for Chase. We were pitiful pair. He took just as much care of me as I took care of him he sill does. Well, this morning I pulled out this recipe and I mixed up the spices for the rub and I cleaned out that old smoker and brought it back to life. Then I remembered this morning's scripture and I thought of you. Do you dwell on the past. See I am doing a new thing. Now it springs up do you know perceive it. I am making a way in the wilderness and streams in the wasteland. - That's beautiful Clara really. I just don't see how it applies. - [Clara] Read that first line again. - Do not dwell on the past. - Stop there. Let it go. The hurt, the pain. - My dad had tears in his eyes that night I drove off with Ronny. I never even looked back. - Let it go sweetie all of it. I am doing a new thing. - [Cassie] What does it mean? - I don't know. Sometimes that's the fun part about God. Sometimes he just gives us a little nibble. It's a good nibble. Chew on it. - [Cassie] Oh, my don't you look spiffy. - Yeah, I'm heading to church. - Daddy and mama just left with Sam if you wanna come back and talk to daddy. - No, no. Look I just need to get something straight with you. - Look if this is about training I know I can be obstinate. - Oh, I can be obstinate. - I don't think you realize just how hard I can make your life. - I bet I do. - Oh, yeah you're gonna think I'm your worse enemy. You're gonna be begging me for mercy. - Yeah, I have a feeling you're the one who's gonna be begging for mercy. - I'm sorry. - One minute you're a total flirt. The next you're backing off. - Your dad's paying me. I just wanna make sure I'm being respectful. - You think you need my dad's permission to kiss me? - Well, I was hoping to do a lot more than kiss you. - Well, I doubt he's gonna give you permission for more than that. - That's not what I meant Cassie and you know it. - I am really confused. - Look I just wanna take things nice and slow okay. Like my training and my horses. - Great now I'm a horse. - I just wanna think it through Cass that's all. - You think it through I'm done. ♪ Oh, oh ♪ You're spinning out of control again ♪ ♪ You life feels like a sinking ship ♪ ♪ You're wondering how it came to this ♪ ♪ You're in the wreckage underneath ♪ ♪ Your hope buried somewhere deep ♪ ♪ You're wondering how long it will keep ♪ ♪ It's never too late ♪ Never too far ♪ For you to reach out ♪ And take a hold of love ♪ Step out on the edge ♪ Don't be afraid of it ♪ And when you feel the rain ♪ Love is made to find you in the hurricane ♪ ♪ Oh, oh ♪ Oh, oh - Well, first of all it's been a really long time.

Thank you for that. - We're getting down to the wire. Qualifying is in less than two weeks. We have to work together right? - Yeah. - [Chase] Am I right? - Yes. - So we're a team. Let's just keep it that way. (loud screaming) (dramatic music) - Sam. - I begged him not to. He made me promise I wouldn't tell. - Sam, Sam. He's not moving. - It's okay, Leila. - Yes, it's an emergency. - He not moving. (machine beeping) He just has to wake up he has to. - Hey, come here. Let's pray. - No. I can't trust in a God who would do this. - Cassie, God may have allowed this. - If you say all things work together for the good I'm gonna scream. - Cassie. - Just go. I don't want him to hear me so upset. - [Marvin] What about the X rays? - Sam has a concussion on the left side of his brain. - It's been over six hours why hasn't he waken us? - How bad is it? - Until the swelling goes down we won't know for sure. The next 24 hours are crucial. Marvin, why don't you go on home and get some rest. I'll stick around and check in on Sam and Cassie too. - Thanks, Doc. - I'm staying too. Even if she doesn't want me in there I'll wait in the family room. - You are family son. Come on Marvin let's get you home. - I'm not leaving. - Get some rest Marvin. She might need you even more in the morning. - He's right. Come this way. (somber music) - Is this the new thing you had in mind God? Is it? - You know how much I care about Sam. Please heal him. - Well, I have news for you. I don't want it. - Would you make him better? God Cassie I just I want her to know you and trust you. - I thought I could trust you. - Can you just let her know that you're there? Please? (machine beeping) - [Sam] I'm sorry mama. - It's okay, baby. - Can I have a milkshake? - Hey there buddy how you feeling? - My head hurts a little. - You sure gave us all a real scare. - Here you go baby. - I don't feel like eating. - You gotta eat, Marvin. (telephone ringing) - Hello. Will do. Our grandson wants a milkshake. He's okay. He's gone be fine. - Let's go get that boy a shake. - Praise the Lord come on. - How's he doing? - Good mom's got him propped up in front of the TV. - Cassie, you don't look so good. - Two nights in a hospital chair will do that to you. - Cassie, why don't we take the day off. You need to get some rest. - You know we can't. We've already lost two whole days. - All right. Well, you have to go easy on him he's had two days off too you know. When he's ready ease him into a gallop. Ease up on that left ring, Cass. - My girth. I think it's lose. Ah. (tense music) My leg I can't move it. - Don't, don't just stay still. - I'm gonna be sick. - Just hold still, Cassie. - Well, maybe God is trying to tell us something. - Yeah, like you need to open a Robert's wing at the Summerville Hospital. - I'm sorry daddy. - No, darling I am. This was my dream not yours. - Don't kid yourself. I wanted this just as bad as you did. - Yeah. - It's too bad grandpa can't ride. Splash would do anything for him. - I'm too old son. - There's no age limit. There was a 67-year old dressage rider in the 1996 games. I looked it up. - Don't y'all go getting any ideas now. You know Sam's right. - Splash will do anything for you. It's a good thing this happened before the qualifying rounds. - That's right. The same rider that qualifies is the same rider for the games. - Are you two nuts. It's less than a week away. - Absolutely not. Look at Marvin he's in the best shape he's ever been in. He's lost weight. He looks to fine. - All things work together for the good. - Even quinoa. - He said it right. - Oh, Lord we're gonna get that Robert's wing after all aren't we? - Sounds like we got some work to do. - Let's go tell Splash. - Yeah, let's go tell Splash. (gentle music) - Steady, Marvin. Keep him close to the edge of the ring. - I know that son. - Watch his left lead daddy. You don't want it sloppy. - Cassie, I told you that. - I know that daddy I'm just reminding you. - You can do it grandpa. - Son you're the only one that has any sense around here. (loud giggling) - Careful easy, easy. You okay? - It's a little wet let's get you sitting down come on. Easy. You cold? - You think he's ready? - We'll see in the morning. - Yeah, I just keep thinking you know if I hadn't have messed up my leg if I'd a just taken the girth one more time. - Yep, this is definitely all your fault. See if somebody would've just let me saddle Splash but no you're all like I saddle my own horse. - Yeah, you're right another bad decision. Yeah, I can pretty much sum up my entire life in two words. Wrong again. - And I can pretty much sum up mine in three. I love you. - What? You love me. You love me. Why? - Because you're you. (soft music) - That would be the reason not to love me. - You know I don't know if I love you more when you're spitting nails at me or when you're crying in my arms. I do know for sure. - No, no don't, don't say it. Don't say it. Okay, say it. I love you. - Mama, why are you just sitting there. We need our rest. - Well, you heard the man let's get some rest. Come on Sam help your mama. You got her. - Yep. - Goodnight y'all. - [Cassie] Goodnight. (dramatic music) (crowd cheering) - As you can see local riders are warming up. This is quite an event for owners as well. (crowd cheering) Number 518 Splash sired by her stallion Commander Liam.
