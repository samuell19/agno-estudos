There you are. Say, has, uh, this castle always had four turrets? Always. Four turrets. That doesn't seem right. If you hurry, sir, you'll still be in time to catch the last tour. Thanks. The room you are now standing in... is an ancient banquet hall. And this table, ladies and gentlemen... is said to be the famed Round Table... used by King Arthur. Many of the restored shields of the Knights of the Round Table can be seen on these standards. Sir Bedivere. - Sir- - [Man ] Sir Bors de Ganis. - Sir- - Sir Lancelot of the Lake. If you don't mind! Not at all. Go right ahead. Now, ladies and gentlemen, if you'll kindly follow me. Over here, ladies and gentlemen... we have the shields of Sir Galahad... Sir Dalliance... and Sir Sagramore le Desirous. Good old Saggy. And over here, ladies and gentlemen... a remarkably preserved portrait. Lady Alisande la Carteloise. - [ Woman ] Wasn't she lovely? - Lovely indeed, madam. She was renowned in legend as King Arthur's favorite niece. Over here, ladies and gentlemen- Pardon me- we have a hauberk dating from the sixth century... said to have been worn by Sir Logris of Astolat. Kindly notice the round hole through the breastplate... undoubtedly caused by an iron-tipped arrow of the period. Mm-mmm. I mean- Well, you see, that happens to be a bullet hole. Impossible! Firearms weren't invented... - until the 15th century. - [ Chuckles] Oh, come now. Perhaps the gentleman saw the bullet fired. Perhaps the gentleman was there. Matter of fact, I was. Undoubtedly caused by an iron-tipped arrow of the period. Well, uh, that concludes the tour, ladies and gentlemen. On behalf of the orphanage and Lord Pendragon, I hope you've enjoyed it. - This way out, please. - Thank you. It's been most interesting. - I beg your pardon, sir. Lord Pendragon would like to see you. - Hmm? Well, that's very nice of him. Just as I remember her. - [ Clears Throat ] This way, sir. - Yes. “Just as I remember her”? And she dead these 1300 years. [ Knocking ] Come in, come in. [Sneezes] And shut the door. That's the worst of these confounded castles- very picturesque and all that... but the wind whistles through like a howling gale. This is the American gentleman, Your Lordship. I'm quite aware it's the American gentleman. - You may go, Richards. - But, Your Lordship- Go, go. Scat. Now, no tricks, young man. I warn you, I boxed for Cambridge until my arm- [Sneezes] Now, what's all this I hear about your creating a disturbance? You don't look balmy. I assure you, Your Lordship, I'm perfectly sane. Well, stop staring at me as if I were a ghost. Have we met before? Here. - Well, no, not exactly. - What do you mean, not exactly? - Either we've met before or we haven't. - It's difficult to explain. I feel like I know you. I know this castle... and the girl in the painting downstairs- Lady Alisande. I know her too. Wait, wait. Don't ring. I wanna show you something. - Take a look at this. - What is it? It's a gold amulet... just like the one on the girl in the painting. Yes, yes, of course. Of course. - A remarkable duplicate. - It's not a duplicate, sir. - Where did you get it? - She gave it to me. Young man, you're either a liar or a lunatic... and I'm not gonna sit here- Here. - Thank you. - Excuse me. I've been wanting to get this off my chest for a long time. - I'm not keeping you from anything, am I? - [Mutters] My name is Martin. Hank Martin. I was born in Hartford, Connecticut, U.S.A. I'm a blacksmith, and my father was a blacksmith before me. Or I was a blacksmith until a few years ago, when these automobiles came along. - Boy, it sure is powerful-looking. - Boy, it sure is. - Go ahead and touch it. I dare you. - [ Engine Sputtering ] - You do it. - I asked you first. Yeah, he asked you first. - [ Backfires ] - [Screams ] Look out! - Did you fix it, Hank? - I fixed it, all right. The operation was a success, but the patient died. Well, we'll give her another whirl, huh? - You kids in no hurry? - No, not me. What do you suppose makes it go? - Know. There's a dragon in it. - A what? A dragon, just like in King Arthur, that spits and shoots out fire. - Oh, you're daffy. - I am not, am I, Hank? I think she's got something there. What we need is a little dragon bait. - [ Engine Sputtering ] - Say, it's taken a hold. Oh, there's a dragon in there, all right. [ Backfires, Engine Stops ] I think it's a reluctant dragon. we'll let it cool off a while. Does that book tell you how to fix automobiles, Hank? This book tells you how to fix everything. At least that's what the fellow said that sold it to me. - Wow! Look at that. - What is that thing, Hank? - Yeah, what is it, Hank? - That's a phonograph. That'll bring a 20-piece band smack into your parlor. - Drums and everything? - Sure. Drums and everything. There's an electric light bulb, a magic lantern and a motorcycle. Wow! Look at that! You mean we're gonna have all those things someday, Hank? Son, every one of those things in that book, every item, we got 'em right now. You know why we got 'em?

Noble King, I crave pardon for this most unseemly intrusion... but I have just returned from capturing the fiercest... of all human dragons. - Behold, the monster! - [Murmuring ] I'm a monster. A weird-looking creature. How camest thou by him? 'Tis a most wondrous tale, my liege. I fear we're in for it. My king, ladies of the Royal Court... fellow Knights of the Round Table... while riding in a far land... I came upon a concourse of a thousand ogres. And despite their numbers... determined to capture the most sky-towering giant among them- Oh, here, now. Wait a minute. I was alone. I was asleep under a tree. Cease, monster! From dawn till dark and dark till dawn, we battled. With lance and sword, I laid upon the demon throng... till all were dead but one- the fiercest ogre of them all... when finally I drove Aim to corner. He changed into a dragon... bellowing fire and flame upon me! When that availed him naught, he became a tusked and taloned werewolf: Oh, now, see here, Your Majesty- At last, the beast changed to his present form... and with one mighty bound... leaped to the topmost branch of a tree... 200 cubits high! I picked up a stone... the size of a bullock and hurled it at the beast. He fell to my feet. And here, milord, here is living proof... of my mighty deed. - [ Sparse Applause ] - I thank thee. Your Majesty, mayeth I sayeth a few words? - In the first place- - Silence, ogre! What makest thou of the creature, Merlin? A most dangerous and evil demon. The beast must be destroyed. - A hanging? - No. Burning at the stake, my liege. Pardon, milord... but the monster seemeth a gentle soul. - Gentle? - He hath nice eyes... and his features are not unpleasant. True, true. Monster, has thou a name? Hast. Martin. Hank Martin. The truth now. How camest thou to this kingdom? Well, I'm a little confused as to how I came here... but I did come from Connecticut. Hast heard of, uh... what he just said? Couldst be in Ireland. Oh, no. It's way past Ireland. You lie. There's naught beyond Ireland but the Great Sea. Trapped by his own words, my liege. An evil demon confronts us, whose abode is the dismal depths of the ocean. Destroy this pestilence e'er he destroy us! - Thou hast a good point, Merlin. - [Man ] Death to the monster! [All Shouting ] Quiet, quiet! Oh, my ears. Monster... I have bad tidings for thee. Tomorrow morning, thou burnest at the stake. Take him away. Well, Your Majesty, if I can just have a minute to- I'd like to explain this- Wait a minute! Hey! Help! Wait! Help! [ Chattering ] 'Tis said this monster has seven heads. Aye, and a forked tail. It is I, Sir Sagramore. Open for Sir Sagramore. - [Door Closes ] - Well, what do you want now? I have brought thee a dainty tidbit from the king's kitchen. Roast meat. At this point, roast meat doesn't appeal to me. - When do I- - Within the hour. How thou must hate me for the mischief my foolish tongue has caused thee. You ought to be press agent for Jack the Ripper. An ogre, you called me. Dragon, werewolf. - No wonder they wanna get rid of me. - Cease. I feel bad enough. If there were aught I could say, aught I could do to save thee- Well, ain't there aught? Naught. Wait! - Zounds! what an idea! - An idea? Who hast condemned thee? 'Tis Merlin, the maker of miracles. What if thou shouldst create a miracle? What if thou shouldst prove a greater sorcerer? Doing what? Nay. Nay. 'Tis a foolish thought. A greater sorcerer than Merlin? None such exists. He's the champion, huh? I have grown to like thee, monster. 'Tis sad to part. 'Tis sad. Farewell.

First, of assuming through demon wizardry... - the form of a man-devouring ogre... - Stay away, clouds. - Of a fire-breathing dragon... - Good old sun.

There's a lot of things I don't know- how I got here, how long I'm gonna be here- - I do not comprehend. - Don't try to follow me. Please. Just listen. What I'm getting at is this: Would you consider being betrothed to me? - But Sir Lancelot. - we'll get to him later. - Do you love him? - Lancelot is a wonderful man. - Brave, stalwart, handsome. - Do you love him? A wife would be proud of such a husband. Do you love him? No, Hank. Hallelujah! No, no. Thou must not. 'Tis most unseemly. Why? Dost thou not understand? I am betrothed to Sir Lancelot. I know. I know. - But when does he get back? - Perhaps a month. Well, you leave everything to me. I'll handle old Lance. But I fear for thee, Hank. Sir Lancelot's anger is known to freeze the hearts of the most courageous. Sandy, don't worry. Now, please. - Just toddle along home to the castle. - But, Hank- Don't you trust me, Sandy? - Yes, I trust thee, Hank. - Good. Here. You forgot something. I'll see you later. Okay, men, shove off. Heave ho. Departeth. Forward! [Clanging ] - Sir Boss? - Yeah? - I must warn thee. - What about? Did you get the squeak out of there? - Methinks I have, sire. Behold- - [ Loud Screech] Not entirely. Not entirely. - But, sire, I must warn thee. - Yeah? Art occupied, blacksmith? - Have care, sire. - Yeah, okay. I'll fix that in a minute. I got a cash customer here. Wait a minute. What's on your mind, friend? Death to a scurvy knave... whom I shall find before this day has ended. Wouldst have an edge on my weapon! Yes, well, you came to the right place, friend. I guess you'd like a little edge on the lance too, wouldn't you? I'll get it. Well, don't stand there fidgeting. Give me a lift here. Come on. By George, big fella, you've got your dander up today, haven't you? Hate to be the guy you're looking for. [Screeches ] In a minute. In a minute. This man has urgent business here. - Somebody do you wrong? - A grievous wrong. Well, I can tell. When a fella's as mad as you appear to be... there's generally a woman at the bottom of it, right? - Thou art wise, blacksmith. - Somebody stole your gal, huh? Naturally, you're gonna take steps-long steps. I shall seek out this interloper... and be he the size of ten giants... and hath he the strength and fury of a thousand lions... I shall meet him upon the field of honor and thrust him through... like an ox on a spit. Ah, but the end shall not come swiftly. Mark you, the death of this knave who calleth himself Sir Boss... shall become legend, a warning to all... who would covet the betrothed of another. I don't blame you. If was in your spot- Did you say “Sir Boss?” Aye, blacksmith. A scourge on the dog. Well, now- [ Clears Throat ] Perhaps we ought to think this over in the cool of the evening. We don't wanna be too hasty about these things. - What sayest thou? - No offence, friend. I just don't want you to do something that we'll both regret. - What wouldst suggest? - There are two sides to every question. I suggest you sit down with this fella and try and talk it over. They tell me he's a fine boy. A message for thee, sire. 'Tis from the Lady Alisande. - It must be for you, friend. - No, Sir Lancelot. - 'Tis for Sir Boss here. -[Clanging] Sir Boss! “Beware. Lancelot cometh.” [ Chuckles ] And here you are. - If you excuse me, I have a couple of irons in the fire. - Wait! I hurl the gauntlet in thy face. Good day, sire. Good day. Clarence, are you there?

Another rope, serfs. Wait a minute. I can't handle this. This is awful. Let's see. If I don't go through with it, I'm a coward, huh? If I do go through with it, I'm a dead hero. Isn't there something in-between, something conservative? - Nay, sire. - Nothing, eh? [ Neighing ] - Tex! - Tex, milord? Get to the king and tell him I've gotta have a ten-minute postponement. - Tell him I've gone for a mustard plaster. Hurry up. - Aye, sire.

Thou hast not only won the fair maiden... but given me the merriest afternoon I've had in years. [ Sneezes ] In years. Thank you, sire. - You proud, honey? - Proud? - Proud of my part in this unseemly spectacle? - Oh, after all- Proud that thou hast made a fool out of such a noble gentleman? Well, won, didn't I? What do you want me to do? - I want you to apologize to Sir Lancelot. - Apologize? - Yes. - For what? - For insulting him. - What do you expect, me to be killed like a gentleman? In truth, thou art no gentleman. - Wait. Where are you going? - I need to comfort Sir Lancelot. Well, after all, sire, it's just the rules- Hast thou not learned there are no rules where women are concerned? Here, take this pill. It will ease thy gripe. [Banging] - Not too close, fellas. - Pray, sire, what art thou contriving? Just trying to keep busy, keep out of trouble. I think I’ll let you fellas in on a little secret. See this gadget here? That's a pistol. These little gimmicks- bullets. Stand clear. Stay right there. I'll show you how it works. Suppose you're out in the woods late one night... and a big old wolf all of a sudden pops up in front of you. You wouldn't be scared, would ya? - Oh, no, you wouldn't. - Not even a little, sire? No, sir, because you got your trusty pistol with you. All you do is just hold it up like that... pull back that hammer like that, get all set, aim- Where'd everybody go? It's all right, fellas. You can come out now. The big bad wolf is dead. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. That's just a sample of what's comin', fellas. The world is gonna be chock-full of miracles- useful miracles... like the printing press, the sewing machine, bathtubs. - Bathtubs? - Yeah. [ With British Accent ] You mean we're all gonna have to take baths? Every single Sat- [ With British Accent ] Every single Saturday, yes. Greetings, milord. Hi, Saggy. That's all, fellas. So long. See you tomorrow. We've got big business here. - Goodnight, sire. - Goodbye. She won't see me? Rumor hath it that Lancelot and Lady Alisande are to be wed within the week. But she's not in love with him. She told me so herself. Female paradox. Well, this changes things. There's an old saying in Connecticut: “When you got to 'git', 'git.” - Thou wouldst leave Britain? - There's nothing to hold me here now. - Greetings, O Mighty Sorcerer. - [Hank ] Hello. What's on your mind, honey? Come in. 'Tis- 'Tis about my father. - What about your father? - He is sick unto death, sire. For three days now he has lay in a bed growing weaker and weaker. Now, now. Has the doctor been to see your father? No, sire. No one. They say he hath the plague. The plague? Be gone, child! - Clarence! - Please, Sir Boss. Thou canst help him. Thou art a mighty wizard. We will pay you these coins, and our pigs, we have two of them, and a goat- I'm afraid you've got me wrong. I'm not, uh- Where do you live, honey? - But, sire- - Wait here for me. And don't be playing around with that. You might get hurt. - With this toy, sire? - Put it down! Come along, honey. Ridiculous that a mere trinket should harm a grown man. Ridiculous. Utterly ridiculous. Who is it? - A friend, ma'am. - A friend? We have no friends. Did you see the sign outside? None may enter this house of pestilence. Fly, stranger, while there is yet time. If it's all right with you, ma'am, I'll stay a while. Stay then, and bless you. - Your husband? - My husband. Well, I'll be careful. I'll try not to wake him. That you will not, for he is dead. [ Sobbing ] Cry if you will, child. A month ago this was our family- a fine husband, two strapping sons... a daughter. Now we're alone. Your sons, are they dead too? Not dead, but better dead. Years ago, the lord of the manor planted certain fruit trees on our farm. 'Twas his right. - His right? - 'Tis the law, sire. Some time ago three of those trees were found hewn down. Our sons ran frightened to report the crime. And although they themselves were innocent... they were accused of the crime. Well, in His Lordship's dungeon, there they lie. And there they shall lie and rot till they confess. But such things can't be. His Majesty wouldn't allow it. Truly thou art a stranger. [ Sobbing Continues ] Cry, child. Would I could cry with you. - It's a masterpiece. - A masterpiece! It needs a touch of ermine. Ermine and velvet? 'Twould clash, sire. - They wouldn't be happy together. - I want ermine! - Oh, yes, sire. - Yes, certainly, sire. - Take it off. - Yes, sire. Certainly. - Ermine. You shall have ermine. -[Grunts] [Sighs] - More hot water. - [Man ] More hot water! [ Man #2 ] More hot water! - Hot water. - Hot water! - [Man #3 ] Hot water. - [Man #4 ] Hot water! Blasted incompetents. They can't even keep the water hot. - I don't how I've survived all these years. - Things are bad all over. Why don't you get wise to yourself? Get acquainted with your people. My people? But I see my people every day. I don't mean these musical comedy personalities around the palace. I mean your subjects. How do you suppose they feel about you? My boy, they love me. On the morrow I journey to London. All along the way my subjects will be bowing and smiling and doffing their hats. Did you ever happen to think that underneath those smiles they may be hating you? - Hating me? - That's the word. But why? I'm a good king,. Good King Arthur they call me. It may surprise you to learn that this country is crawling with people who hate you. Sick people, hungry people, people who no longer hate you because they're dead. - Why, sire, I can tell you- - Cease! [ Groans ] Oh, heavens, I am sick. And it's all your fault. Young man, I could have you hanged for this. But you won't. 'Cause I have a feeling you believe me. All these lies about my subjects? Are they lies? I don't know. I don't know. What, with my ill health, how could I know anything? If you don't know, sire, I suggest you find out. - Find out? - Yes. We could make a trip around the country. Might open your eyes a little. But... how 'bout my cold? This could easily help your cold and your country. A miracle? It could well be, Your Majesty. - How worketh we this miracle? - Well- How does it strike you, sire? Well, as thou sayest, it's a... cinch? - A cinch. - A cinch. I postpone my official visit to London. Make the trip disguised as a humble freeman with Clarence and me along for good luck. But dost think that any humble garb can conceal evidence of our royal blood? It'll take a bit of doing, but we'll handle it. - Till dawn, sire? - Till dawn. I'll only be a minute, honey. I just wanted to say so long. - So long? - Goodbye. - Thou art leaving? - In a few hours. - I see. - But I had to tell you this. I think you're doing the right thing- about Sir Lancelot, I mean. Why, marrying me would be a national disaster. Disaster, sire? This knight business, I'd-I'd be no good at it. Instead of gettin' on a horse and goin' out and polishing off a few ogres or dragons... I'd be hanging around the house, watering the lawn or fixing the fence or something. And our kids would grow up and think their daddy was a sissy... because we'd be the only family without a dragon's head over the fireplace. It's better this way, honey. You marry Sir Lancelot, settle down... and raise a lot of little lords and ladies. I hope you live happily ever after. Goodbye, Sandy. So long, Hank. [ Sniffles ] - What thinkest thou, my boy? Do I look like a commoner? - Well- Well, what about this? Yes, that helps. Better. And this? Here. May I? - Thank you. - Oh, yes, much better. Huh. I say, we are not alone.
