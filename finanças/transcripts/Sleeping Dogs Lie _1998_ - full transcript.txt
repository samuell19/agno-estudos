I gotta go. ♪ I shall wake up in the morning ♪ ♪ On my own honeymoon ♪ (moaning) - I gotta go! - Just a second. (moaning) (audience clapping) - Christ! Where is she? Where the hell were you? - Oh, bugger yourself! (audience clapping) - Evening, Mr. Small. Great hands. - Always glad to hear that. (whimsical music) - Your wife is very talented, Jack. Smile, Jack. - It's a fact, my friends. As soon as they get off the boat, the Roman Church welcomes every true Catholic into our country, making a comfortable home for them and for that Dago on the tiger. That's right! Making a home here for the Pope! God save the Dominion of Canada! One flag, one religion, and one King! (clapping) - Well done, well done. - Daniel Small exploits immigrant workers! Corman Distillery is an exploiter! - Somebody sampling the stock? (laughing) Purely medicinal, eh folks? - It's fatal! It's fatal! - They've been shunning us out too long! This cannot continue! We deserve the same opportunities! If Corman Distillery can stay in production, they can pay their workers! (dramatic music) - [Woman] Here, take one. Do you read English? - Come on kid, time to get your feet wet. - Daniel Small is a son of a bitch. He rips off immigrant workers. Yeah, take one. They've got no right! (dramatic music) Shayna, get the police! Shayna! - [Shayna] Leave him alone! Let him go! - Shayna! - Do something! Stop him! (dramatic music) Can't you help? - We don't need to attract that kind of business. Not now. - And why now in particular? - I'm expanding my business. - Is that some kind of a joke? Prohibition must be killing you! - I need $100.000. - Dare? - Well, why not? You and your wife are in the chips, aren't you? (groaning) (dramatic music) - You brought this on yourself, son. Stay out of Corman Distilleries. Daniel Small doesn't take kindly to people meddling in the business. - You're just gonna leave him there? - He'll get over it. Clean your lip, I'm dropping you at the Grand Opera House. Owner needs an escort to the bank. Listen kid, I told your old man I'd show you the ropes. Not all the work is pretty. (dramatic music) Stage door is at the side. (lighthearted jazzy music) ♪ There was I ♪ - Manager's office. - Top of the stairs. ♪ Waiting at the church ♪ - Do something, act like a man! - Get out, before I lose you and the whole deal is done! - Clear the way! - Tratt Detective Agency. You need an escort to the bank? (lighthearted jazzy music) - Jack, where's that champagne? - I'm the business manager, not your step and fetch it. - Oh come on, Jack. You've been lucky to fetch for me. - Son of a bitch! I built this place! - Come on, let's not have another foaming fit. Come on son, you might as well join the party. (lighthearted jazzy music) (chuckling) - Good God, Amby. One million dollars. - That syndicate can turn my theaters into movie houses or dog kennels. (chuckling) Young man, get yourself a glass. - Oh, I- - Here, you can take mine. - [Ambrose] There you go, my wife never touches the stuff. (sighs) - Movie houses. Amby, I can't believe it. - [Ambrose] Cheers, gentlemen. - To good fortune, Amby. So, Theresa. I hope you'll let Amby lead a life of indolence now, huh? - I'm sure he will do as he will, Mr. Flynn. - Why not, eh? - Exactly. Theresa, who can look down their noses now at the showman and the brewer's daughter. How's your drink, Thomas? - Ambrose, it's still early in the day. - For Christ's sakes, can't I even celebrate the sale, Theresa? Theresa, let me celebrate. - I'll take the deposit to the bank. - I'll sign that check. - And don't forget Sister Rosaria expects us at the orphanage to present our donation. - I'll be there. You do love me don't you, babe? (dramatic violin music) - You know I do. - I really should buy her something nice. (celebratory music) - It isn't the time or place. I think we should be discussing this later. - I want to make sure we're clear. - Could you wait below, please? - Yes, ma'am. - I'll just be a minute. (celebratory music) This is all the public wants ever since the end of the war. (clapping) - Well, at least you give the public what they want. - I'll be well away from it. (cheering) So, your last name is Willis. Irish, is it? And how many generations off the boat are you, Mr. Willis? - We're good old Orange Protestants. From Cabbagetown. - Oh, Little Belfast. And me, a German Catholic. Oh, what would the boys at the Orange Hall say to you taking arrangements? Thank you very much. Did you pout like that when you were a boy? I bet your poor mother denied you nothing. - I don't remember my mother. She died when I was three. - Oh, I'm sorry. Today I can afford to be generous. Would you let me pay for your lunch? - No, thanks. - Would a man of principle allow a millionairess to walk into the restaurant alone? (lighthearted music) - Hey, ma'am. (silverware clangs) I can run back to the theater and see what's keeping your husband. - No, please, that's... What time is it? - Nearly 2. - How did you hurt your lip? In some defense of your principles? - I walked into something. I can telephone for you. - No, I'll go on to the orphanage myself. I know my husband. - Would you like me to walk with you? - Yes, thank you. (dramatic violin music) - Two kids and my mom were killed in the fire. - Must've been horrible. - It was hard on my dad. Gave me up for a while. Spent most of my kid years in a place like this. Not Catholic though. - And now you're a detective. - It's something to do. - Why not a policeman? - You get a healthy distrust for police growing up as I did. - Thank you for your kindness, Mr. Willis. You be sure and bill my husband for your time. Sister Rosaria. How are you? I'm so glad to see you again, I'm sorry my husband couldn't be here. Hello children, hello Margaret. How are you? (dramatic music) (doorbell rings) (moaning) (mysterious music) (moaning) (woman screaming) (lighthearted piano music) - I'll take two. Thank you, Marjorie. (lighthearted piano music) - Here, here! - Oh, oh, wait. You got a place? Somewhere we can go? Do you? - Jesus! - What? What's the matter? - You're a fella! - It's okay, it's okay! You knew it, asshole! (lighthearted music) (clapping) (screaming) (dramatic music) - Hey, you. What are you up to there? Was that you, Willis? - I thought I heard a scream or something. I guess it was nothing. (mysterious music) - Nope, it's not like Ambrose to just fall off the face of the Earth. - Ambrose Small? - He's missing, two days. - You call the police, Mr. Flynn? - Oh, the police. The police do next to nothing. Because that Catholic shrew he married says that he's out celebrating. - Well, the man banked a million dollars. - Sure, sure. Look, Amby would go out and booze it up and not tell the wife, but none of his friends? Nah uh. That's not Amby Small. For God sake, in 48 hours, I go to the press. - All right, all right, let's not go off half-cocked. This paper, and I'm gonna need a deposit. - That'll be fine. - Mr. Flynn. Supply and marshal the list of your pal's haunts. Cole, you slip over to the Grand. Look around his office, see what you can dig up. Mr. Flynn, it's your money, but I'll lay odds he's on your door tomorrow. (chuckling) - A millionaire goes missing, and the wife won't call the cops? Mr. Tratt, I'll just be very glad if he shows up alive. - It's my job to stay on my toes. - Maybe you missed him. - [Man] Mr. Small never left. - Can I go upstairs? Talk to Doughty? - Asshole. - What are you doing? - Mr. Doughty, I'm looking for Ambrose Small. - Mr. Small's out of town, business. - He forgot his appointment calendar. - You're with the Tratt Agency. What do you want, a check? Send me an invoice. - Mr. Small was last seen the day of the sale. Was he here when you got back from lunch? - Who says he's missing? Certainly not Mrs. Small. - What business is Mr. Small on? - Personal business. You can go now. (dramatic music) - Personal, I bet. - That's all they said. - What about you, Tink? You come up zip too? - Ditto. Sunny side of the beach. - I called the National, the Jockey Club. Nobody's seen him. - The addicted gambler calling bets no matter what shape he was. - Unless he was far away, like Havana. - Missing from but a mere phone. - Ambrose Small, everything in the whore houses. - Cole Willis? Come with me, lad. Come with me, boy. - Hey! What the hell's going on? - [Cop] He was seen behind the Grand last night, we got questions about the disappearance of Ambrose Small. - The guy's on a bender, for God's sake. - [Cop] Come on, Willis. - All right, answer the questions and get right back. And you treat him right. (dramatic music) - So where do you think he is, Madam? - Flynn, stay out of it! Mrs. Small. You must have some idea. - He was with a woman. There. Is that what you wanted me to say? - What woman? - Shut up! Can you give us a name? - No, I cannot give you a name! - Just a coincidence you were outside the theater when Small goes missing. - I guess so. - Do you guess? - It was a coincidence, yes. - You have a record, Willis. Brawling, assaulting a police officer. - That's right. - Your lunch with Mrs. Small, what time did you leave? - Around 2. Then I escorted her to the orphanage. - You escorted her to the bank, she bought you lunch. Do all your clients buy you lunch or just the lady ones? Young buck like you. How old is her husband, hm? 50? How long have you known Mrs. Small? - We only met. - Only met? - I said that! - Do you suppose she buys lunch for her chauffeur? Her gardener? The fella opening her doors? - I wouldn't know. - See, not quite right. Woman buying lunch for a man she only met. But the rich are different, eh? And she is rich. - I wouldn't know. - You watched her bank one million dollars. - I've never seen her before. I was doing a job! That's all I can tell you. - This isn't done, laddy. (dramatic music) - You didn't have to drag me here. - Come on out. - Mrs. Small? - What's it do ya? You won't get under her skirt anyway. - Why haven't you followed up on any of these leads? I mean, look at this stack of reports! - Get Flynn out of here! Jonas, please. Let's get this thing under control. Mrs. Small. You may go now. - Thank you, Inspector Mitchell. (dramatic music) - You all right? - Yes, I'll be fine, thank you. - Need a taxi home? - Yes, please. - Theresa. Where's my son? - I wish I knew. Driver, Glen Road. Mr. Willis, I can I can find my own way. - That man owns Corman Distillery. The agency's done work for him. - I appreciate your concern, but- - You were at Corman, weren't you? - We sold the business to Daniel Small after my father died. - Is that a coincidence? Selling it to your father-in-law? - He ran the distillery for my family, which is how Ambrose and I met. Now, if you don't mind. - Funny world. A temperate woman making her money in beer. - Mr. Willis. Nothing about my life is simple. - Do you know anything about your husband's finances? - I know everything about them. - Well, if he's cashed a check lately, the bank knows where he is. - [Man] I'll inform Mrs. Small if any checks are cashed in their account. - Where are the bonds? There was $100.000 worth of bonds in here. - Mr. Doughty was in this morning. He often opened the box under Mr. Small's instruction. - Jack Doughty has absolutely no right to our personal deposit box. - [Man] Yes, the Grand Opera House. - Mr. Doughty must've heard from your husband. - Mr. Doughty, please. It's the Dominion Bank. He what? He didn't return to the theater? - Mrs. Small. Mrs. Small. Do you know where Doughty lives? - No, I don't. Why would I? - I'll find out and I'll call you later. Will you be at home? - [Theresa] Yes, call me. Glen Road, Driver. (knocking) - What? - Jack Doughty, is he here? Aren't you his wife? - Get off of me, get off of me! - Where's Jack Doughty? - Gone! You won't find him. - Where's he gone to? - I don't know! - Where? - The train station. - Which station? - West End, 20 minutes ago. (dramatic music) - Doughty. (dramatic music) - Get out of my way! - Get out of the way! Move! (suspenseful music) Come on, Jack! Jack. (suspenseful music) (train horn blowing) Come on. Up. Wake up! Sit up and talk to me. Sober up! - What's going... What? Jesus. What is going on? - Mrs. Small informed us that your husband has something that belongs to her. - [Cole] Your husband and Small fought a lot. - If Jack took anything it's 'cause they owed him. He made those theaters, and then Ambrose throws him into the deal like a stick of furniture. - Do you know where Mr. Small is? - Hiding, probably. - Probably? - Yeah, Amby liked to gamble. No saying how far he was down. - A million dollars would cover a fair debt. - What were you and your husband fighting about at the Grand the day Small disappeared? - Do I have to answer questions from him? - Answer this one. - We fight all the time, I can't remember. - He said he didn't want her to see you. - Look, I don't know anything about that business between them, all right? - What business is this? - Jack said he had the bill on Theresa. He said she came by here a couple times after Amby went missing. - That's a lie. She doesn't even know where you live. - If there's a liar in any of this, it's Theresa Small. (dramatic music) - But she's expecting my call. - [Woman] I'm sorry. Mrs. Small isn't available to come to the telephone. - Did she sucker you too? (dramatic music) - Want a ride home? - Maybe Doughty's with Small. - I figure Small sent for Doughty. Now the two of them are probably shacked up with, well, a hundred thou in mad money. - Maybe. - So we'll give what we have to Flynn, call it a day. Hold it, Cole. You know, son, I beggared up a few times trying to sort out good folks from bad. Push far enough, people are capable of just about anything. Now, the cops have you on the scene. So stay clear. Mrs. Small has money enough, she needs help, she'll get it. You trust too easy, kid. You protect the wrong people. First and foremost, protect yourself. - Yeah. - There's a woman in the parlor. Female visitors are not allowed. - Give us two minutes. - I heard from Inspector Mitchell. Are you all right? - You knew where Doughty lived. Why were you there? - Well, I told Inspector Mitchell. It's personal, and painful, and it sheds no light on my husband's whereabouts. - That satisfied him? - He agreed to respect my feelings, yes. This has been a very difficult time for me, Mr. Willis, and I very much want my husband found. - The police will do that. - I want to hire you to find my husband. - My services are contracted through the Tratt Agency. You need me? Call Tratt. (dramatic violin music) - I consider my family as such, that we're offering $15.000 for information as to the whereabouts of my son. - Is that dead or alive? - Either way. - Where's the wife? Why isn't Mrs. Small here? - Yeah. - Ah! That's all today. Direct your remaining questions to Inspector Mitchell. - I'm gonna head to the Grant. - Oh, don't be a dope, go grab lunch. - No, I'll meet you back at the agency. Tell Ed I'll be back in an hour. Did Mrs. Small come back that night? - No. And Friday night she'd usually stop to see how box office stood. She telephoned stage door asking about Mr. Small around 10. - And Ambrose never left? - Not by stage door. - Is there another way out? - There. There's a door. No one has the key except Mr. Small, and I guess Jack Doughty would too. - What's in there? - Well, I've never seen in. - Is there another exit through there? - I believe, yes. (wondrous music) - Jesus. His own private love nest. (mysterious music) - I guess that way takes you down to the back alley. (mysterious music) - What the hell are you doing? - Doughty killed Small. - The bonds? - Listen. He was sore at Ambrose for gypping him. - And so he killed him? Stuffed him in the furnace? You ever smelled a burning body? That isn't something people would miss. He could've just as easily walked out the alley door. - Walked where? - All right, Cole. Drop it. Small will be back, dragging his tail behind him. You're on my nickel now. So forget it, all right? Don't forget, we have lunch with Daniel Small tomorrow. (dramatic music) (dog barking) - Inspector Mitchell. - [Man] We have a body down by the tracks! - Mitchell here. Ambrose abducted? By whom? Can you give us a description? Well, what the Devil can you? Oh, go to hell! Ah, Judas Priest! Send it to the morgue. (dramatic music) Ah! - Damn dogs. Jesus. It's Ambrose Small. - The victim's body is not that of Ambrose Small. - Is she sure? I mean, his face was beat in. - Mrs. Small has informed me that her husband was afflicted with hammered toes. This would make positive identification possible by the feet. - Mrs. Small. Mrs. Small. The sighting of your husband in Mexico, is that possible? - With webbed feet? Yeah, he swam. (laughing) (cameras flashing) - Mr. Willis. Will you ride with me so we can talk? Please, Mr. Willis. There are bounty hunters crawling around my house, all over the property. I don't feel safe, I need someone on the premises. - That's not such a good idea. - You told me you were principled, and I believe you. - You have to tell me the truth. Why did you see Doughty? - Can we go somewhere where we can talk? Please? Mr. Willis. Please, will you wait? He sold me letters. Letters my husband had written a woman. - Where are these letters? - I burned them. - And he? - They were obscene. - Who's the woman? - Vivian Doughty. - Doughty's wife? - Jack threatened to take 'em to the papers. He had tried to sell them to Amby, but my husband didn't care. - So, why did you? - My husband struggled with alcohol, and gambling, and with women. I tried to protect him, even if he wouldn't protect himself. I didn't go to the police when I was sick with worry because he has done this kind of thing before, and he would always come home saying that he was sorry, saying it was all a mistake. - Do you think he's still alive? - I have to. (dramatic music) - Okay. I'll come to your place in the morning. (dramatic music) (Cole whistles) King Eddie. (dramatic music) - Cole, this is Mr. Small. - How do you do, sir? - Have a seat, son. You know Mr. Gallagher? - I heard you speak a couple of weeks ago. Quite a speech. - Well, you get pumped up and the words just flow straight from God. - Do you really think the Pope's army is set to invade our country? - I think nothing, I was raised by Catholics. I have seen guns in the basement of their churches. Their sisters of service practicing military drill. Oh, it's coming, my son. Just as sure as judgment be ready. - Thank you for stopping by, J.J. - Well, I'll get back to my table and leave you to your business. Gentlemen. - Sometimes it's the loose wheel that keeps democracy rolling. - I suppose, sir. - So, Mr. Willis. You're my daughter-in-law's friend. - Cole's a good kid, Mr. Small. That was a wrong time, wrong place type of thing. - I was doing a lady a good turn. - And what do you suppose this lady's done to my son. Was that part of your turn? - As far as I know, she's as anxious to see him as you. - Bullshit. Damned hypocrites, the whole Corman family. They sold the distillery and then jump behind prohibition. Now they're using my money to buy themselves into heaven. - If you don't want us doing business with her, sir, we won't. - Pious is the Pope, Theresa. But she put a Protestant in her bed when it made her money. My son got her million, now she's rid of him. - But it was her money too. - Half it. Never underestimate Theresa's cunning, or her greed. - Cole! In any way, are you that gullible? Hold on! - She didn't do it! - Oh, Jesus, kid. - Not this clean, Ed. Not without a trace. You don't learn that kind of thing in Catholic girl's school. - Well, you know bugger all about Catholic girl's school. Now listen to me. If you go to her, I'm gonna have to cut you loose. (dramatic music) Cole! Don't get into it. You'll come out the wrong side. (dramatic music) - Anyone in or out lately? - A bunch of priests and nuns. She's seen nobody else. Ally, she's seeing nobody. - Cole Willis. Mrs. Small is expecting me. - Wait a minute! - Who is this guy? (cameras flashing) - Let me take a picture. - She planned a special dinner for the two at 7 that night. At 6, she told the cook to hold off to 8. When we didn't hear from him, she said we can serve her at 9. We kept his warm 'til a package came, then she told us to put them all away and go to bed. - Is she alone a lot of evenings? - I don't know how she put up with it, but I suppose it goes both ways in a marriage. - How do you mean? - I mean as I've said. - What was the package? - I didn't see. You'll find the bathroom down the hall. (mysterious music) (nuns praying) (lighthearted music) (woman snorting) - That pleasure powder's gonna eat the insides of your nose. - Beat it. Friend. If I knew where he was, I'd get the 15.000 myself. - Were you in love with Ambrose? - I don't know, was I? - You had relations with him. - Well, maybe I did. - He throw you over? (laughing) - "Did he throw me over?" How old do you think I am? I was 23 when his old man traded me off to Ambrose. - You were with Daniel Small? - Father like son, leave it at that. I knew he'd never ask her for a divorce, and I knew she'd never give him one. So, I find myself pregnant, not able to work, he doesn't want to be around me. Jack took me in. - You had a child? - I miscarried, six weeks after Jack married me. Oh, and you know how I paid Jack back for being so nice to me? I took up with Ambrose as soon as he'd had me. And then he sells the theater and Jack with it. He doesn't care about anybody. Not me, that's for sure. - Do you hate him, Vivian? - Sometimes hate is not a big enough word. - Did Jack kill him? - No, he couldn't. - Who then? - I don't know. I make a point of not knowing too much, and I'm not gonna start guessing now. Hey, I'm stupid, but I'm not that stupid. - I tell you what. You keep this in case you get smarter. - Hey, divorce is a sin. But for a few hail marys, maybe murder is worth it. (dramatic piano music) (thunder rumbling) (suspenseful music) - Here. - Mr. Willis. - There was a package delivered the night your husband disappeared? - Yes. - Who was it from? - Ambrose. - Hm. This is quite a present. - Yes, he always did understand the significance of a gift. - What did you think the significance of this was? - That he was sorry for something that he had done or was about to do. A gift can mean several things depending on the context in which it's given. - Maybe this meant goodbye. (thunder rumbling) - I assume it meant that he would have too much to drink and might not come home that night. I'm very tired. Would you turn out the lights as you leave? (dramatic violin music) - Is someone there? - My name's Cole Willis. Mrs. Small hired me. - I know who you are, Mr. Willis. - Sister Rosaria. Thank you for coming. (car honks) (crowd murmuring) - Still playing detective, Willis? This way, Mr. Rainville. - Yes. This is his house. (dramatic music) Mr. Rainville is one of the most respected psychics in America. - This is a sideshow, he's a carney gag. - With the most impressive record of crimes solved. - [Cole] Come on, Mitchell. - Mrs. Small. We've searched from door to door, we've dragged the harbor, we dug up half the ravine, I have steam shovels turning up the dump. - And I so appreciate that you're being thorough. - Your husband's disappearance has been reported by every newspaper going. If he is just wandering around out there, somebody reliable will come forward. - A tea leaf reader is reliable? - I have no ransom demand, I have no suicide note, I have no proof of foul play whatsoever. It must begin somewhere. - And you do everything you need to do, Inspector Mitchell. - Thank you, Mrs. Small. Maybe he's got amnesia, or some nervous affliction. We can't be sure that he's dead. - Oh, he's dead all right. (dramatic music) - You sure? - I feel him on the other side. - What are you seeing? Anything? - A room. A bedroom. A woman calling to someone. No, screaming to someone. "Stop, stop!" (dramatic music) He's in a car, in the back of a car, on the floor. No, held down. - What do they look like? The car, which way is it traveling? - East. - [Cole] Oh, this is crazy. (yelling) - Red hands, your hands covered with blood. His blood. Dead. Dead! - No! - He's dead. - All right, knock it off. Mitchell, Jesus! - Excuse me. (dramatic music) - Can you get another look at that car? (phone ringing) (crickets chirping) (knocking) - Mr. Willis. - I'm right here. - The telephone is for you. - This is Willis. (sobbing) - [Vivian] Someone broke into my house this week. - Vivian? - [Vivian] I got out, but I haven't been home in two days. - Did you call the police? - I saw them at gateway to get in the theater at the stage door. - [Cole] Who? Who are they? - I think I made a mistake, I made an awful mistake. - What kind of mistake? - [Vivian] I was with him. - With Ambrose? When? - [Vivian] That afternoon, or maybe that night. We were both out of our minds, we were drunk, but he wasn't dead when I left him, I swear. I couldn't of killed him. I remember going out the stage door. - [Cole] Okay. - [Vivian] No, they must've took him. Oh God, I don't know. He wasn't supposed to be heard- - Who are they? - I think they killed him. I don't know, I don't know, I don't know anything! And they're gonna kill me too. - Where are you? I'm gonna come and get you now. - No, no. I'm in a hole on Bleaker. I don't know the number. I can come and meet you, it's not far. - No, no, no, no, listen. I know the speakeasy on Bleaker. You stay there. - Okay, okay. (sobbing) - What's going on? - Vivian Doughty. She knows what happened to your husband. (dramatic music) - Cole. Cole! (door slams) (dramatic music) (dog barking) - She was over there by the phone. - Vivian? (dog barking) Vivian! (dramatic music) - Whoa, whoa, it's all right, it's all right. I'm with the police. Christ. (siren blaring) - Detective Hammond wants to speak with you. - Who is Hammond? - Provincial Police, special investigation. Some twit gets his knickers in his twist, and I've got another smart ass on my back. You wanted Willis? Well, Hammond, do you want him or no? - This isn't yours, is it, Willis? It would appear Mrs. Doughty chatted for a time with her killer before she went over the edge. Can you tell me why she telephoned you? - She didn't trust cops. - What'd you say exactly? - I think she knew what happened to Small. She was with him at the time he disappeared. - The woman's a liar and a drunkard. - A dead one now. - Mhm. Did you ever meet Jack Doughty, Mr. Willis? - A few times. - So you'd know him to see him. - Sure. - [Mitchell] Do you think Doughty perpetrated this? - The letter amongst the contents of Mrs. Doughty's handbag was addressed to a postal box. The sender had according to this, been forwarding money until recently. Unsigned, postmarked, Oregon City. I need someone who can recognize Doughty on sight to come with me to Oregon. - Well, I should be the one to go. - Have you ever met Doughty? - Not in person. But it's my case. - Yeah, yours to bungle, lose the evidence, and alert the perpetrators. Mr. Willis, would you be good enough to come with me to Oregon so I can arrest Mr. Doughty? - [Cole] I don't know. - Well, Mrs. Small hired you to locate her husband. You want to find him, don't you? - Yeah. Yeah, I do. Okay. Okay. (dramatic music) - Excuse me, Sarah. In you go, lads. Down the basement, hurry it up. That's it, well done. - Inspector Mitchell, what are you doing? - Please, Mrs. Small, if you've done nothing wrong this will help clear your name. That mob out there believes what it's told, and I intend to prove them wrong. - I can assure you, sir, my husband is not buried in the cellar. - [Cole] Detective Hammond believes we'll be back from Oregon in a week to 10 days with answers regarding your husband's whereabouts. (dramatic music) - Let's see if there's anything in the next compartment. (train horn blowing) Let's see if anybody knows this fella. Hey, friend. You seen him before? - No. - More familiar? - You can try the main office. - Any luck? - Could be the camp bookkeeper. - That's the right line for Doughty. - Uh huh. The office is just across the way now. He may bolt if he sees you here, so wait outside until I call you. - Okay. - Eddie. (dramatic music) - Hello, Jack. (dramatic music) Jack! Give it up, Jack! They got Vivian! She's dead, Jack. They killed her. (train horn blowing) - If Small's friends hadn't raised a stink in the legislature, Mitchell would still be twirling on his arse consulting tea leaf readings. - You could uncuff me so I could eat proper. - I'll uncuff you. Only because I have to relieve myself, and I don't fancy your company. Mind your behaves. (dramatic music) - What are you staring at? - You hit the son of a bitch, didn't you, Jack? Everything he'd done to you? She was screaming, and you had to get her out of there. You should've finished him, but you didn't have the belly for it, did ya? But you knew someone who did. Who'd you call, Jack? - You're in over your head. - Come on, Jack. Cooperate! You cooperate, and- - And what? I tell you, I end up as dead as Vivian, as dead as Small. I'm keeping my mouth shut. (dramatic music) - Catholic Theresa insinuated... - Jack, Jack! What'd you do with the money? Come this way, Jack. - Did you kill Ambrose? - Just smile! - [Reporter] Jack, come on! - Are you loving this, Jack? - Where's the money, Jack? - [Reporter] Where is it, Jackie? - Cole, Cole! - Go back to your Catholic church! - You shouldn't be here, Mrs. Small. - I will not have the likes of Jack Doughty spreading lies about me. Does he know where my husband is? What does he say? - Nothing, he won't talk. Let me take you home. - And you one to spend the money on, Mrs. Small? Done with Jack, eh? Well, we are not done with you, Mrs. Small. You hear me? We are not done yet! That's right, Mrs. Small! We are not done yet! - I wish to put an end to the spurious comments in the press and elsewhere, and let the church know that it may rely on my continued support. My check for $500.000. (clapping) (cameras flashing) - Ambrose was born a Protestant, and he remained a Protestant until Theresa. Theresa, who panders to the Roman church. Theresa, who conspired with the Catholic elite. The Bible tells us plainly to honor the Lord, thy God. But who does Theresa honor with her blood money? The Pope! - Come on, clear the way. - Are we going to stand for this? It's intolerable! She's giving all of her blood money to the Catholic church! Jack is taking the- - Let us pass, please. - Where's your husband, Theresa? Giving his money to the Catholic church? - Hang for you, Catholic bitch! - Get her out of here! Get her out of here! - Lover! - Freedom for Jack! Free Jack! - You, John Doughty, stand indicted of theft. To with the theft of bonds totaling $100.000, how do you plead? - Not guilty, your honor. - Free Jack! Free Jack! - She killed her husband for the Catholic church! She wants his money for Rome. Free Jack! - Get this woman out of here! - [Woman] Let go of me! - Still doing the lady a good turn, boy? Where's my son? - Mr. Small. Please. (dramatic music) - Look at me! Hero of the people. - Jack, wise up. You gotta tell them what you know about Small. - You'd like me hanged. Well, I'm walking away from this, free! - Cole, Cole. (crowd jeering) (bottle breaks) - Oh, Sister. I'm sorry. - God grant the strength you need. - Talk to me for a second. These visits are like waving a red flag out there. - I can't stop the people from judging me. (dramatic music) - If she comes back, tell her I've gone. - When will you be back? - It was a great story. But you know, I don't believe a- - Guys, I need to talk to Tratt. He around? - Look what the cat drug in. - Tratt's not here. - Hey, Cole. Want to see something funny? - Tink, don't bother. - What's the matter? Cole's an Orangeman. Aren't you, Coley? You like fun, don't you, Cole? - What is it? (laughing) - Oh, what's the matter? Don't you get it? - Where's Tratt? - Haven't seen him in three weeks. - What do you mean? - He showed up for work, and the place is closed tighter than a drama. - You took an Orange oath, Cole. A man who breaks an oath better watch his back. You hear me? - Tink, sober up. - You've gone Mick lover. You used to be one of us! - Ed! Ed, it's Cole. Ed, you were right. (car honks) They're gonna hang Doughty for something he didn't do! (mysterious music) - [Man] About time you showed up. - [Man] What's the hurry? (dog barking) - [Man] Hey, fellas. (dramatic music) - Look, I'm going. Hey, I said I'm going. - You should've been gone sooner. - [Cole] Ease off, pal. (dramatic music) - Oh my God. Oh, Cole. What happened to you? - It's okay. It's okay. - I saw something I shouldn't have at Corman Distillery. - What? (dramatic music) Don't leave me. - [Woman] There she is! - [Man] Mrs. Small! - Mrs. Small. Mrs. Small. Has the court frozen your husband's account? - Is your husband's family behind it, Mrs. Small? Mrs. Small? - Will you have your husband declared- - Would you let us pass? - Dead even without a body? - I'm not sure. - Theresa must pay. Theresa will pay! Freedom for Jack! - We've reached our decision, Your Honor. In the matter of John Doughty, accused of the theft of $100.000, we find the defendant guilty. (dramatic music) (crowd jeering) - [Woman] Get outta here! - Do you believe what the newspaper said? - Not usually. What in particular? - That a guilty verdict means that the jury thinks that Doughty's responsible for it all. For Amby's disappearance, everything. - That's not what he was tried for. - Yes, I know. - The law won't allow a charge of murder without a body. Doughty knows something, but I guess he figures any amount of jail time beats being hanged. - Well, and I suppose he's right. I just wish this would all end. (dramatic music) - Sweet Jesus. - Yes, this is Theresa Small. - Fire! There's a fire! - Who is this? (dramatic music) Who are you? (glass breaks) - Call the fire brigade. - Well, you'll have to give me time to get the money together. (dramatic violin music) (fire burning) - Just stay back. Let it burn. I don't think he'll talk to us. - Well, we'll see if a holiday at the Don will soften Mr. Doughty's disposition, huh? He oughta be back from exercise soon. We'll wait here. Do you read the Times, Willis? Sir Arthur Conan Doyle wants to solve the Ambrose mystery now. - Let him. - Sherlock bloody Holmes. (chuckling) - [Man] Doughty! - Oh, Christ. Hurry up! Hold him up, Cole. Come on, hold him up! (dramatic music) (vacuum cleaning) - Gone? What do you mean? Where did she go? - That man called again, from the other evening. - What man? - I didn't know the caller's voice. He said to say he was a friend of her husband, and that the Sisters of Charity were premature. - Premature how? - I'm sure I don't know. - Megan. You knew it would get her to the phone. - Someone put up a notice in the inner sanctum at the convent of the Sisters of Charity begging prayers for the soul of Ambrose Small. I saw it myself the day he disappeared. Who'd ask prayers for a soul they didn't think was dead? (door slams) - Sister, it's Cole Willis. Did Mrs. Small put a notice on the secret board? Where is Theresa Small? - Mrs. Small has been under a great deal of strain. She needs time to contemplate to allow her nerves to settle. - Does she? - There is no need for your concern. - Was it Theresa? - I told Theresa even Christ was made to wrestle with his demons. - People are disappearing, being killed. I want Theresa alive. - Cole, stop it. What are you doing? - I can have him removed. - No, that won't be necessary. Just give us a moment, please. I am sorry. (door shuts) - I found Jack Doughty hanged in his cell. - Suicide? - Jack had too high an opinion of his neck. I think it's the same people who killed Vivian and your husband. - Ambrose isn't dead. - What? - He's alive, they telephoned me. - Theresa, it's gotta be a hoax. - No. This man told me things only Amby knows, things in his letters to Vivian, in the letters I burned. The man said they were higher ups, he didn't know the reasons. But he's been guarding Amby for two months, and he's tired of the game. - We gotta tell Hammond. - No. Someone in the police is in on this. Whenever anyone gets too close, they throw the trail. He told me to bring him money. Alone. - Come on. (dramatic violin music) (phone ringing) - Yes? Yes, this is she. - Ask to talk to him. - Yes, I know where that is. Could I talk to my husband, please? Yes, I'll be there. Alone, yes. He wants me to go to an address on Mill Street tomorrow. (dramatic music) - Go in, I'll be right behind you. Okay? (dramatic music) (knocking) - Hello? (dramatic music) - We're upstairs, Mr. Willis. Please join us. Well, Mr. Willis. I was wondering if we would see you. It seems you and Mrs. Small are constant companions. - Where is my husband? Where is he? - I'm sorry, Mrs. Small, but I'm the one in charge here. I'd like to see the color of your money, please. - It's in the car. - Then I suggest you bring it here. - You don't have Small, there's no way you do. Come on, let's go. - No, I want to see Ambrose. - Really? I'm surprised you're so anxious. Ah, that'll be him now. - Theresa. Theresa, he's playing you. Let's go. - No. You have my husband, I want to see him. - Well, I can tell you he's very anxious to see you. Especially after you hire Jack Doughty to smash in his head with a fireplace iron. - That's a lie. If Doughty said that- - What the hell's going on here? - You should've hired somebody with more balls. Ambrose wasn't dead. He got up after Doughty and Vivian left and walked out. (loud footsteps) - My God, Theresa. Look at your color. Somebody get this woman a glass of water. - You don't have him. - I believe we've seen your worst nightmare. - Theresa, let's go. - Not yet, son. It's time Mrs. Small and I came to some sort of deal. - Deal? Why would I deal with you? - You killed my son. I don't intend to let you keep his money. I only want the share you promised the church. - No. - You think this will all go away. The cry will end, and you can have my son declared dead in the courts. (dramatic music) - [Cole] Theresa, watch! - That isn't gonna happen. I won't let it. - Enough. Let's go. - I made you believe he was still alive. I can make the public believe it too! - What the hell was that about? - Just get me home. - Theresa. Tell me the truth. - I don't know the truth. - Theresa! For Christ's sakes! Do you know what happened to him? - No. - You're lying! - I don't know. I don't know what happened, I swear to God- - Stop lying to me! - I wish I knew, I don't. - What did you do? - Doughty came to me and said that he would kill him if I gave him money. And I was so... I said yes. And I'm sorry. Dear God, I'm sorry. But it was too late. - What happened? (sobbing) - I don't know! - Damn it, Theresa! Tell me. - He said he tried. (screaming) He said he couldn't do it. - Oh God, help! (screaming) Somebody help! - So I called the stage door, I had them go and look for Amby and they said he wasn't there, that he had gone. And so I thought maybe he wasn't so badly hurt, maybe he would come home and... I don't know where he is now. And then Doughty demanded the money anyway and I told him I wanted nothing to do with him. Oh, Cole. I've prayed that he's alive. I have prayed. - I'll take you home. (car door slams) - Cole. Come in with me. Cole. Oh, please. Just let me try. - Try to what? What? Make it better? How are you gonna do that, Theresa? How the hell are you gonna do that? - You watch your voice with me. Cole. Where are you going? Cole! - Ed. (laughing) Hey. - Yeah, I hear you've been looking for me. - I heard you closed up shop, what happened? - I've been laying low. Listen, kid, when I took you on, I promised your old man I'd do right by you. You're a good kid, decent. Walk away. - Ed, I'm in this real deep. - Listen to me! Walk away. Get out. (dramatic music) - What'd you got there, Marjorie? - What the hell are you doing here? - What are you selling? - Let go. Let go of me! That's mine. - Oh, that's nice. - Jesus, look at what you're doing. - Where did you get this? - You're crazy. - You tell me where you got it. (phone rings) I don't know if what's going on has to do with the drugs coming out of Corman's, or the fact you're giving all your money to the damn church. I'm sick of this bullshit, Theresa. Between him dealing drugs, and you and your lies. - Cole, don't be crazy. Come back to the house. I can help you. - No, no. No, no, no. You're in this up to your neck. I don't care if you all go down, I'm clearing my name! - Operator. This is Theresa Small. Get me the police. (dramatic music) - I told you you'd come out on the wrong side of things, didn't I? Wake up, boys. - Where'd he come from? - Daniel's in his office, get him. - When your boys pounded me I figured it was for something I saw going on the truck, not coming off. Tidy operation. Between the bootlegging and this. - Sit down, Cole. - You're too decent to be in this, Ed. What are you doing? - Looking after myself, kid. - I remember going out the stage door. - Did she struggle, Ed? Vivian. - [Hammond] This isn't yours, is it, Willis? - Did she put up a fight before you pitched her off the roof? - I beg your pardon. - And you. - Just a second. (screaming) - [Vivna] Help me! - Called up Daniel. Told him the crazy theater manager finally did Amby in. And Amby would've financed the old man's bootlegging too. Not Theresa. - They're using my money to buy themselves into heaven while I go to the poor house making ginger ale. - So, Daniel calls his clean up man. That's you, Ed. You're a professional. What did you do? Huh? How did you get rid of the body? Did you burn it, Ed? - Nice guess. But wrong. - Pushed far enough most people are capable of anything. - First and foremost, protect yourself. - Right, Ed? - You destroy the evidence, Theresa walks. You don't know what you could believe anymore, or who. - Well, that's the way it's always been, Cole. That's what I've been telling you. - [Man] Get out, there's cops all over the yard. (sirens blaring) - Jesus Ed, what are you doing? - Looking after myself. - Stop! Get back here! - Hey, come on, stop! Ed! - You sons of bitches! I'll have your badges. You whore! - Just get in the car. (dramatic music) - Ed, come on! Don't do this! (glass shatters) Ed! Oh, Jesus, Ed. (dramatic violin music) - Are you all right? - Tratt's dead. - Cole. I'm sorry. - You don't have to worry anymore. - What do you mean? - Daniel hired Tratt to cover your tracks. And he didn't even know. He was the best, Theresa. They'll never find the body, never. No body, no crime. (dramatic music) - Let me take you home. - It all started with you. - Cole. Don't. - No blood on you, Theresa? - Cole. Cole. Cole. - [Cole] No trace of Ambrose Small was ever found. In 1923, the courts declared him legally dead. Theresa Small lived as a recluse in Rosedale until she died in 1935. She left her estate to the church. (dramatic music) (bird chirping)
