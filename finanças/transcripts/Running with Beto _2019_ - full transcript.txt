We're at the cusp of it tonight. A full-blown race towards sanity. All of us can say we've done everything. Everything we could possibly do, and we're racing across that finish line. (honking) Woman: Go Beto! Beto, Beto, Beto! (honking) Can we get a picture? Eric is a first-time voter. Yay! -First-time voter! -(cheering) Do you know what day today is? What's today? Do you know? Hart: Do you know why today is important? Have your parents voted? That's good. Let's hand out buttons, let's hand out buttons. (children clamoring) Beautiful. He's got some more, he's got some more. Salas: Hi, is Christina home? My name's Amanda Salas, I'm with Battleground Texas. I'm calling people in your area to encourage you to go vote for the Democrats in this election. We're calling because it's Election Day. Do you know if you'll be voting Democrat up and down the ballot today? -(ringing) -He's actually-- Oh! -(cheering) -Yeah, so he's like... (speaking Spanish) -I'm like-- -(rings bell) Hey, Beto! -I voted for you! -You did? (cheering) No way. Oh my gosh. Did you vote already? How come? -Ah. -No papers? It's okay. Then you pray for Beto, okay? Okay. There was a meme that described me earlier. You know how when you're in a group project, and you did all your work, but you don't know if everybody else fucked everything up? -That's where I'm at right now. -(laughter) I know I've been working my ass off, but I don't know if everybody else has been. Woman: Beto, we've got a fireman who voted for the first time right here. Beto: First-time voter? -Woman: A fireman! -(cheering) Have you had a chance to vote yet today? Okay. Was there any way we could count on your support for Beto? -Oh. Thank you. -(door slams) Oh my. Blitzer: This is the moment our people are waiting for. The first results about to come in. We're watching it oh so closely. A high-stakes night here in Washington. We're standing by for the first votes this hour. (TV playing indistinctly) Okay, guys, you gotta know this. I have offered when he wins, if he has to take over Ted Cruz's office, I will go do a spiritual cleansing on that office. I don't want Cruz cooties -on our boy. -(laughing) And I mean that. -(indistinct chatter) -Ken Batista: It's still early, but Democrat Beto O'Rourke has a lead on Republican Ted Cruz... (cheering) All: Beto! Beto! Beto! I just can't get excited yet. Not at 60%. We're at 60%. That's... the margin of error is too close. Last time people got excited this early, was a presidential election, and I can't do that to myself, personally. -(cheering) -It's still way too early to call. Beto: Hey, Wysong, do you wanna go in and just see what it looks like in there? What kind of line there is, or if there's still people still voting? -(laughs) -Yeah. We'll see. We need it to continue at some rate. Me, too. I'm still hoping it. For all of those who are still in line, there were a couple polling places that stayed open late in Harris County in the Houston area. Stay in line. That polling place will stay open as long as it takes for the last person in that line to get to the front of the line and cast their ballot. Beto: Thanks for coming out and voting! The lights are now off at the polling site, which hopefully, that voter got to vote before... before they turned it off. Blitzer: We're just moments away, moments away from this, the biggest round of poll-closings tonight. Williams: We have a big call, this is out of Texas. -All: No! No! - NBC News is projecting Ted Cruz will return-- -Oh! No! -(groaning) And Republicans will be guaranteed control of the Senate as a result. Fuck! Shut the fuck up. It's a 78-- The Latinos turned out in greater numbers than they have ever turned out. But it wasn't enough. Fuck. We have been talking about how remarkable it is that Beto O'Rourke would get this close. It feels, for it to be called at this point after watching it on such a knife edge, feels like a blunt ending to this. ♪ ♪ (indistinct chatter) So, it's 9:00 now... ("Don't Stop Believing" playing outside elevator) Let's get a little more information because they'll... Man: We have a crowd of about 6,000 people. -Beto: Awesome. -Man: Yes, sir. -Beto: Good? -Yeah. (music playing louder) (cheering, applause) Man: Thank you, Beto! (cheering continues) All: Beto! Beto! Beto! -Hey! How are you, man? -Good to see you. Thank you. Thank you so much. Beto: You guys, family. Everybody, come on. Jimmy. Come on, guys. Jody? Let's all get over here together, real quick, huddle. Come on, everybody get in. All right. I love you guys so much. There's no way, physically, biologically... -(laughter) -...on the amount of sleep and Whataburger that we've had that we are still standing right now... It was love that carried us through, and it's something that will persist after we've disbanded as a campaign, and it's something great and we just released that. And so, I just feel very, very, very lucky, and I love you guys more than you'll ever know and... I know I was a giant asshole to be around sometimes... -(laughter) -...and you all never allowed my shortcomings to get in the way of running the best campaign this state has ever seen. And so, I just am just super, super grateful. Love you guys, all of you, so much. (crowd chanting): Beto! Beto! Beto! (loud cheering, whistling) Crowd: Beto! Beto! Beto! (cheering) Beto: El Paso, I love you so much! I was inspired. I'm as hopeful as I have ever been in my life. And tonight's loss does nothing to diminish the way that I feel about Texas or this country. (loud cheering, whistling) This campaign holds a very special place in the history of this country every day going forward, and you have made that possible. -(cheering) -Every volunteer, every ambassador, everyone who knocked on doors, everyone who made phone calls, everyone who allowed themselves to hope, and to believe. I'm so fucking proud of you guys! (cheering) Yes! -Yes! Yes! -(clapping) I paid for that one! (laughing) Oh, get it out! -Beto (on TV): ...United States of America! -(crying) (cheering on TV) I am honored to have been able to do this with you. I am grateful forever, and we will see you out there down the road! Thank you, El Paso! Thank you, Texas! Thank you every single one of you for making this possible! I am grateful! I am grateful! Thank you! (crowd roaring) Crowd (chanting): Beto! Beto! Beto! (indistinct chatter) Well, you did make us cry, -so don't worry about it. -(laughter) I love you. You ready to go home? (kids chattering) Come on, buddy. (sighs) Oh, this sucks! This fucking sucks, but we're gonna be okay. Trish: We didn't knock enough doors. I mean, that's what it is. We didn't knock enough doors. Gay: We did all we could do. We're gonna let him go home and enjoy his children, get reacquainted with his wife. Let him have some downtime, and then get him ready for 2020. This is a simmering fire. This is just the bed of coals. This is the bed of coals here, and we're just getting cooking. (McClinton speaking) (cheering, chanting on video) Salas: I'm pretty heartbroken about Beto. But this is one battle. This is one battle, and we won a lot of other battles tonight. You know, Texas is officially a battleground state. A lot of people didn't think that was gonna happen until 2020, if it ever happened, and we made it very clear that Texas is now a competitive state. I had a lot of people messaging me tonight. "I don't know what I'm gonna do now." And I'm like, you're gonna cry about this tonight, and tomorrow we're gonna work. (speaking Spanish) -Molly: Thank you. -Beto: You're welcome, Molly. (Henry speaks) I am gonna stay home tomorrow. (Amy speaks) (Molly speaks) (Henry speaks) -Beto: You ready, Molls? -Amy: Yeah, let's do it. Henry: Do what? -Go to bed. -Get you guys to sleep. (indistinct chatter) (plates clatter) -Did you end up eating? -I just had biscuits. (sighs) I need to figure out what to do with all my shit -in DC. -(laughs) -We'll figure it out. -Yeah. People have brought out the very best in themselves. Somehow, we've gotta be able to continue to feel that way. That this cannot be the defeat of the hope that you feel, or the purpose that you have in your life, or the things that you wanna see this country do. It can't, and I don't think it will be. I... believe too much in people, and they're too strong. Everyone's got it in them and through this campaign, we're reminded of that, and... we get to be a part of it, which is just fucking amazing. Just like the most amazing thing in the world. So cool. And so, you know, maybe in some way, and you may disagree 'cause I think I'm a lot more cheesy and sappy than you are, but I think maybe we did what we were supposed to do. Like... (slaps table) You know. So, maybe that's it.
