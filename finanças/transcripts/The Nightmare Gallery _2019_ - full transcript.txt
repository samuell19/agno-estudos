[thunders] [soft music] [calling tone] [keys tinkling] Professor! [woman] Jesus, Sanjay, it's like 3... They miscataloged it! They didn't know what they had. Can we just-- Can we talk in the morning? [Sanjay] The Hermopolis dig, my requisition went through. I have The Alchemical Manuscript of the cult of Hermes Trismegistus. - Good Christ! - It's ours, professor. [laughing] They thought I was asking for some old grave robber's journal or something. I'm on my way. I can't wait to see what they say when Ellen and Osama outshine the rest of the department. Us against the world, right? - Always. I'll see you soon. - Okay. [suspense music] [knock on the door] Professor! Hello? Professor? What the fuck? Where did it go? What? No, no, no, no, no. [noise] [crackling sound] What the-- How did that get-- [scream] Sanjay? It's Sam. Sanjay? Are you here? [suspense music] Sanjay? [phone ringing] Professor Rand. Ha. You can't be serious. No foul play? Are you blind? Did-- Yes, yes, I'm calm. Listen, he didn't just get up and run off in the 20 minutes it took me to-- What about his phone? Mm-hm. Mm-hm. [sighing] Okay, fine. Case closed. God forbid you do any actual fucking police work. [suspense music] [suspense music] [knock on the door] Yeah? What the hell are you doing here, Rand? Oh, just sampling the fine academic vintages of tomorrow's gas station attendants. - You care to join? - You're grading papers here. You know we had a faculty meeting? Oh... damn it? Since we moved to three a week, I just get them all mixed up. What the hell you're talking about? We just have the two. Come to think of it, you have missed every single Friday meeting. Get a damn TA. Jesus, it's been years. Kid probably got himself deported or something. [suspense music] Hello? Hello? Dawn? [noise] [suspense music intensifies] - Surprise! - [scream] - What's with the knife, Sam? - I just-- You and the cupcake agreed to a clean fight. I-- It's just I called you and you didn't answer. That's how surprises work, honey. Happy anniversary! Aw... You are so good and I was-- I was at the office and I didn't remember. Hush, hush, it's totally fine. You're just going to have to make it up to me later. That is a deal. [doorbell ringing] - Are you expecting someone? - No. - Ooh. - [mailman] Sign here, please. [Sam panting] Ooh. You ordered a whole bunch of lead, right? This thing is so frickin' heavy. - [Dawn] Oh! - Ooh. [Dawn] Oh, no. It's addressed to you, babe! [suspense music] What is this? A subscription box? You're doing Indiana Jones stuff now? It's from Sanjay. Sanjay? That-- that's crazy. He's been gone all these years, scares the shit out of everyone and then sends you a box of junk? There's no mistaking it. This... This is the text that Sanjay found. It's thousands of years old and he wrote all over it. Let's call the police. And let them confiscate it? No. They wouldn't even know what they are looking at. No, we-- No, I, I need to help Sanjay. - He would do the same for me. - I know. I know... I have faith in you. But can you fit some anniversary dinner in your schedule first? [muttering] Still at it? [sighs] Just getting started. You have class early. Mm-hm. Happy anniversary! Thank you. You too. Well, don't stay up too late. - I love you. - Love you too. Well, okay. [muttering] Okay, Sanjay, what does all of this mean? [sighing] [suspense music] [whisperings] Help me, help me, help me! Help me! [screaming] Please, tell me you didn't stay up all night. No, I slept, I just-- You never quite made it to bed, huh? God, and on our anniversary. God, I'm sorry I'm such a shitty wife. It's not a big deal. I'm late for yoga. Make sure you eat before class. Lecturing on low blood sugar is against the rules, remember? - Mm-hm. - Dispense some knowledge. Yeah, the ghost of Socrates is going to be so jealous he could not have courses. - I love you. - I love you too. [speaks in foreign language] Something museums. [repeats in foreign language] [repeats in foreign language] Grand, grand museums. Sure. [soft music] I'm sorry, can I help you? I wasn't sure if that was you or not, professor. We missed you in class, thought maybe you were sick, but-- Your Anthro 220 class. We sat there for like 15 minutes, but... Oh, my God! I was focused on some other work and I just-- No, it's cool. We'll just see you next time, right? Okay... Wait, are you the one that's been posting these? Yeah. Was he a student of yours? Grad student. Do you mind if I take this? Sure. Okay. [suspense music] Hey! It was you! You sent me the package. You left me the trail to follow. No-- I don't know what you're talking about. I'm here to give you this. My mail box was out of order, I take it? The door was unlocked. Aft-- after we talked in the library, I asked around and heard you needed a TA. And I was hoping that you might consider-- [Sam] I don't need one. The department head said that you did though-- I don't care what he said. Are you-- Are you even a grad student? No. It's just after I-- After I saw the poster, I wanted to help you find him. You can't just find him, okay? He's been gone for a long time. I've tried everything. He's just-- He's just gone. Then why are you posting those? Okay, I'm not clear on why you would care. I've made posters like those before. For my sister. She disappeared a few years ago. I'm sorry. I'm sorry that you went through that. But it has nothing to do with Sanjay. Did you even know him? No. Look, I'm sorry. I just-- I saw the poster and... it was like it was happening all over again and I don't know, it might sound irrational, but I thought that maybe, if I helped you find him, I could-- Look, you're just a student. You have enough to worry about. I'm sorry, professor, but that is not how this works. I never get to stop worrying about my sister, just like you don't get to stop looking for your student. Okay. God, this must be what it's like to argue with me. So, what is your name? It's Chloe Bishop. Samantha Rand, Professor, I guess. Look, the majority of the search is back at my house if you want to come help me go through it. Okay. And, if you prove to be helpful, I might consider bringing you on as my TA, maybe. [Sam] Hey, I'm home. It's about time. What took you so long? When you said you left something at the office, this wasn't exactly what I imagined. [Sam] No, I imagine not. Chloe, this is my wife, Dawn. Dawn, Chloe. Um, Chloe's going to help me with the project. She has a personal interest in it. Well, it's been a long time since your last late-night research party. - I'll whip up something. - Thank you. When you were looking for the person that you lost, you didn't happen to get a random box of artifacts in the mail, just on the off chance? No. You think this is all related to Sanjay's disappearance? I do. Why don't you dig in and see what you can find out? I think I found something. Maybe. It's just a drawing and it's only appeared on the internet once. - How on the earth did you find-- - Reverse image lookup. Where's it from? It was published in a psych study in 2015. This shrink was studying cases of extreme schizophrenia and disassociation. It doesn't say what the image is of, but maybe we can call the doctor tomorrow. We can do one better than that. It's only a couple of hours drive away. But first, I'm probably going to take you home. I've kept you too long as it is. No, don't worry about it. It's-- I feel like I'm actually doing something, you know? It feels good. Calling it a night? [Dawn] And you look wiped. I'll be taking the young lady home this evening. Thank you. Thank you. Okay. Chloe. I really want to thank you for helping Sam. This Sanjay thing has been really hard on her. It's fine, I um-- I am not really being entirely selfless either. Well, I know Sam and, when she's set on something, she's going to keep going until it's done. And I'm not in that world with her, but you are. Would you look out for her? She means the world to me. Yeah, yeah. Thank you. [suspense music] [dull noises] [voiceless] Ah, wife, come join us. We're about to play around. What do you say? Ah, she's too timid for these stakes, too frightened to even speak. I hardly know her, yet I can see she's not clever enough to understand what's going on. [Dawn] There are rules. She gets a chance. Sit. She consents. She's not equal to the task. The truth is too large for her. This is not good, professor. She is lost. [voiceless] [coughing hard] [Dawn] You okay? Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. It's probably just my sinuses or something. Sorry, I woke you. No, it's okay. Do you want some water? No, just go back to sleep. Actually, I'm going to get up. I'm going to get an early start. What do you mean? Nothing. Um... Chloe found something last night and it's few hours up north and I just want to follow up. But what about class? Um... I'll check in with Thomas. There's no way he'll say no. Oh, come on! Thomas is the worst. Don't lose your job over this. I know. I'll call him, okay? I love you. I love you too. [suspense music] I wasn't expecting something quite so homey for someone who specializes in the tough cases. It's useful for people to feel comfortable when chatting with me. I'm not sure candy works on an anthropology professor though. Look, um... I'm interested in a drawing. Uh, does this look familiar to you? It does. Do you mind me asking what the significance is to an anthropologist? That's what I'm trying to find out. Well, I'm not sure you'll have much luck. The patient who drew that isn't very communicative. Well, maybe I could speak with them. That would be against policy and most certainly pointless. Look, what could happen? It's either no harm, no foul or your unresponsive patient becomes responsive, right? I'm sorry. The policy stands, immediate family only. Just out of curiosity, does your patient do other drawings of symbols? Any chance they drew this one? Or maybe this one? [suspense music] Colton, you have a visitor. It should be okay to approach him. Hey, Colton. I was wondering if you could help me with something. Can you tell me about your drawing? Yeah? What about these? These are his. His! You should not have these. Someone's a thief. Roll the bones, oldest trick in the book. You want to know what happens next? [coughing hard] I bet you didn't win. Colton! Ah. Someone lost the game. Tell me about the dice. Tell me what the drawings mean. Shouldn't have them! Someone's a thief. Stole from museum! Museum, Grand Museum? He's watching you, watching your heart. He wants to know if you're scared. I'm scared, you should be scared. Oh, God! Oh, you should run. You should run. Oh, fuck that! You should die. Yes, yes, yes, yes. You should die. Fucking, kill yourself now before it's all-- It burns in here! Burns and scathes and no room for you! Oh, my God, it burns-- There's no room in here. But they'll give you a room in here! They'll give you a room in here! [shrink] Colton! Orderly! Professor Rand, out now! But the drawing, it will lead you like it led me. Fear and lead. Like lead, you know, so heavy! [shrink] It's okay. It's okay. You should die! You should die! - I wish I did. - [shrink] Settle down. - I wish I did! - Settle down. Just settle. [knock on the door] Oh, Chloe, come on in. Who's Chloe? Just one of my students. I guess you got my voice mail. I did. But an interesting lead is no excuse for missing meetings. And I heard you missed a class out of the blue. Okay, circumstances have been a little abnormal, but this isn't just a lead. This is the kind of research that can make headlines. Regardless, it's no excuse for missing meetings. Do your job. Is now a bad time? Um... Ignore him. So, uh... lead. It means "to lead". You went to see the psychiatrist? Oh, yeah. I met the patient who did the drawing. He was, um... interesting. Well, I could come by later tonight, if that's okay. Great. Okay. Where are you leading me to? [suspense music] [shrink] CT scans and symptoms consistent with exposure to unfiltered reality. You did this to me, Sam. How will you protect me, Sam? I suspect the patient-- I've seen the naked face of truth. Unable to grasp what she's just witnessed. She's attempting to process the experience in a perpetual level. [back and forth] Perpetual level. A self-imposed hell. Worried that, incessantly-- a rotting tooth of the mind. The situation recalls an expression about omelets and eggs. [Sanjay] We were going to prove them wrong, it's us against the world. Not everyone can walk in the light of truth, Sam. Some will merely burn. [voiceless] There, see? I'm done. I need you to learn all of it, you understand? See, I've lead you exactly how he led me. Now, the great work will not be stopped for our convenience. There's not a lot of time. We are going to need you to take notes. There'll be a test. Wait, wait, I don't have anything to write with. Speaking from experience, I'm quite confident that you're wrong there. Take it, you hesitate, it's gone. You wake up, all of this is gone! Do it. Do it! Do it! Come on, professor! Do it! Do it! Do it! [screaming] [Dawn] So, Thomas was in her room yelling at her? He's always had it out for her. And now he has a better excuse than disapproving of our lifestyle choice. Shitty old white guys, best part of academia, right? I'll drink to that. Sam. Hon, are you okay? - Fine! - You look a mess. I'm just-- I'm just eager to get to it. No, you're going to go rest. No, I gotta-- I gotta do this, please. I thought you'd be home a few hours ago, so I've been working on this for a while. I don't think it's an actual language. There's nothing on the internet that's like it and I-- - What? - I can read it. All of it. You're kidding. No, it's an ancient lost language. Proto-Sino-Tibetan. It led to Chinese and other languages from that region, but... it's pictographic. Here. God... Wait, how long did this take you? This afternoon. Uh, here's what I've got. "Winter, sleep, ground, you, flame, men, naked, summer, sun." Some more nonsense. Okay, maybe this language is just too old. No, no, that's ridiculous. Winter, sleep, ground, you, flame, men-- Doesn't that sound familiar? [muttering] Winter, sleep, winter, sleep, winter, sleep. Oh, God... This. Yes! "In the winter, he sleeps on the floor in front of the fire with the men and goes about all in rags, but, in summer..." Ah, that is it! It's The Odyssey. No, that's insane, it's not even in Greek. How could you possibly figure that out? It's because I teach it. I mean, hell, you just took an exam on it, right? My God... Wait, this was-- this was purposeful. Only a handful of people could have ever possibly figured that out. This was meant for you. Can I see the book? [Sam muttering] Winter he sleeps on the ground... This "you" is wrong. Winter sleeps, ground, you-- This "you" is a mistake. No way! Someone goes through this much effort, they're not going to make a mistake like that. Wait a minute, what else doesn't match? [Chloe] Okay, this "are". "You are... asleep and awake." Okay, uh, it's a dream guide. Grand museums, leads, "You are asleep... and awake." You. This doesn't make any fucking sense! I mean, what the fuck am I supposed to do with that? Um, we're just exhausted. This will all make sense tomorrow. What was that? I dropped a book. I'm going to head out. Good night. - Did you throw a book at her? - No, I just-- What was that? Look, no one gives a shit about my hand. - I just-- - Sh. I give a shit. What the fuck is going on? You're throwing shit, your hand's all cut up and you're lying to me. Sam, when have we ever lied to each other? I'm going to bed. Are you coming too? No. I'm going to stay up for a while. Get some rest. [suspense music] What's going on? Come on, open! Dawn? Dawn? [deep male voice] You are not permitted passage. You are yet to make yourself worthy. You lack the conviction to proceed. Where's Dawn? Where's my wife? It would be better, easier to choose death. The price of knowing is always the same. Your offering is accepted. She shall sleep among the [indistinct] in their millions. [whisperings] You shall sleep. You shall sleep... You're okay. Baby, why wouldn't I be? No reason. I'm so sorry. Oh, I just cut myself when I put my necklace on. It's no big deal. Wait, what's in the bag? Nothing, just go back to bed. No, wait, what's going on? What are you doing? What are you doing with those? - What are you doing? - Those aren't good for you! I don't know, but something in them is making you sick. - That's ridiculous. - Really? You're sleeping like shit, you could lose your job and you're hurting yourself. I'm fine. I'm just under a little bit of stress. Stress? Come on, Sam! We've been together long enough. This is something else. - Give me the bag! - No! You got to know I'm doing this for your own good. I can't-- I can't believe that the person I trusted the most in the world would steal from me. When all I'm trying to do, the only thing I am trying to do is to find Sanjay. Sanjay? You're killing yourself over Sanjay? You don't even know that he's involved! Sam? Sam, don't go like this! Do not go. Sam, look, I'll give them back to you. I'll give them back to you. Sam, don't leave. Don't. Come on, we can figure this out. Just talk to me. Talk to me. I'm sorry. I love you. [mobile phone vibrating] [suspense music] Okay, I'm inside. [Colton] We need a place she won't look at every day and so that no one else will stumble across it. [Sanjay] I got it. Holy shit! You know? This would be a hundred times easier if we just asked her to help. [Colton] Your professor, you really care for her? Yeah. Of course, she's... She's my best friend. You'd like for her to be able to pass another night in peace? Then keep that damn foolishness out of your mouth. It's likely that you and I will die doing this. This is our contingency, Sanjay. A signpost on the path for your professor should we fail. I just-- [Colton] To become the map for mankind's journey to light... any price is a bargain. [distorted voice] Isn't that right, Samantha? You're already thinking about it, aren't you? Weighing, whether or not, you could live with yourself if you sacrificed everyone. You're such an eager student, aren't you? [panting] - [Chloe] Hey! - Oh, my God! [Dawn] Thank you so much for coming. Absolutely. I just didn't know what to do. So, she just left-- in the middle of the night? We had a fight and she just wouldn't let go of those things. I didn't want her to leave, but-- No, of course not. Look, I know I hardly know her, but this stuff is getting to her, I can tell. It's like our life just got turned inside out all of a sudden. But I'm going to do something about it. [suspense music] Okay, she's gone. Class is still for another 50 minutes, so we should have some time. Wait, shouldn't you be in class not breaking and entering with me? No. Keeping your wife from retiring to a padded cell is way more important right now. Hold on, this is new. Um... "Only when the young crescent moon's light alone shines." Does that mean something? Could be part of the message we're working on. [Chloe muttering] Crescent, crescent... I'm getting an awful feeling about this. [soft sad music] Yes. Okay, so there was a new moon five days ago. So, this young crescent moon is either tonight or tomorrow. Whoa, wait, wait! What are you doing? What? You take that and she's going to know that you came in here and stole this stuff. So? This is my wife we're talking about. There's no way Sam's not going to resent you for that. And right now she's probably just blowing off steam. So what? We just wait? And we just let her go down this rabbit hole? Dawn, we know exactly what she knows. So we're going to keep a close eye on her and, when nothing happens tonight and nothing happens tomorrow, she's going to realize this was all in her head. Okay. All right. "Only when the young crescent moon's light alone shines, the dream guide leads. You are asleep and awake, grand museums?" Where the fuck is it? Ah! "You are asleep and awake." Oh. "You are asleep and awake." "You are asleep and awake." "You are asleep and awake." [door creaking] [Sanjay] You. You are foolish too. Found your way here to this hypnagogic state or is it hypnopompic? [laughing] It's both. Place liminal to sleep and wakefulness. I'm trying to help you. Tell me how to find you. Your journey won't be a pleasant one, especially with that failing liver of yours. So desperate, you poisoned yourself. Even I didn't go that far. I suppose one could argue. It means you're ready. I gave you everything you needed, Sam, to bring you here. Within the voice of wisdom. [Sanjay's voice] I gave you everything you needed, Sam. Within the voice of wisdom. [groaning] [knock on the door] Oh, dear God! [distorted] I'm calling help. Please, come. [heart monitor continuously beeping] Sam! Sam! You okay? How are you feeling? Oh, you're awake. Hold on, hold on. I'll get the doctor, okay? Wait, wait. What happened? Thomas found you in your office last night. You were sick. Um... They said you overdosed. That you did some damage to your liver. And you could have gone in a coma... or died. I love you so much. Why would you do that? I'm here for you. You could have talked to me. Just go get the doctor, please. - Sam... - Dawn, go get the doctor! Just go. [suspense music] [phone ringing] Hey, Chloe, I was just about to text you. - I think I found something. - She left. She left? What happened? I tried to stop her, but then she shoved me up against the wall and she was screaming and... Okay, is she still in the hospital? I don't know. Maybe. - I'm sorry, Chloe. - No. I should have stopped her. Dawn, she was out of control. Look, why don't you come back here? No, no. If she's in the hospital, they'll find her. If not, I might know where she's going. I think I've finally found what she's been obsessing over. - [woman] Hey, thanks for the tip! - [Sam] Yeah, you bet. Hello? Anyone here? Holy shit! [whispering] Sam... I need full compliance, otherwise, I get to change the date on the placard. Why are you here? Did the little lamb get lost? No, no. I was led here. Explain! In my dreams, my student, Sanjay... Mr. Ramdas, mm. I'm sorry, no exceptions. The museum is for ticket holders only. I choose what happens to intruders. I have-- in my pocket I have my ticket. I'm not sure that I care. [male voice over loudspeakers] Security, we talked about this. Check our guest for a ticket before you have your laughs. You're no fun. It's not my job to be fun, pet. Shouldn't be my job to babysit you either. I have my ticket. Wait! Where's Sanjay? My job is to keep out undesirables. I don't have to help you. Good luck finding your way. Be careful of the hungrier exhibits. [evil laugh] [creature panting] [sniffing] [growling] [screaming] [creature sniffing] [bones cracking] [screams] [man humming] Hey! Oh! [with English accent] Oh, what the hell are you doing with that? That's a bloody priceless relic you're tossing. Were you planning on clubbing me the thing, were you? Ugh, rude! A saint used that cross in the 13th century, Edmund of Canterbury. Here's the fibular taken from his left leg and it healed people that touched it. Well, actually the healing part is a little bullocks, but they did make his leg burn the relic. And that's not in my collection yet, if I'm being honest. [sighs] What do you have that stupid look on your face for? Who are you? My darling, I'm a docent. You are in a museum. Are you that easily confused? What kind of museum exactly? The museum-- Well, not the museum of this or that, but rather "The Museum". Why would Sanjay bring me here? Why does anyone come here? They were led here either by donating something or... just going mad. Oh, mad? Yes, dear. Ooh, you've been quite a long ways now, haven't you? Rough trip here? I'm looking for my student. His name is Sanjay. Hmm, yes, I know him. If you just follow me. [ringing bell] Uh-- I, uh-- I don't go in there. Uh, well... Thank you for your patronage, dear, and do take care to keep off the carpeted areas in case you decide to, uh-- Well... [door creaking] Dear, dear, dear. Magnificent, isn't it? Sanjay! I've been looking for you and you've been here the whole time? [Sanjay] I know. That's what gave me hope you'd actually make it here. What is here? My marriage is on the rocks, I probably lost my job. Please, tell me... that this is worth it. Most certainly, professor. This is the noblest of causes. For people like us, this is the Holy Grail. Uh, well, bad analogy. That old trinket is lying on a shelf in here somewhere. I've spent the last decade unlocking the secrets of this place, but, with your help, we'll finally finish what I started. Not a decade. It's only been three years. Hmm, I always wondered what would happen to time. Feel that? That's the power of real change, real alchemy. Alchemy, really? All those references to affirmative action will seem so quaint after we quite literally change the world. I think we're beyond departmental bullshit, don't you? When you said it was us against the world, you weren't wrong. We stuck together and now we have this. Oh... The Alchemical Manuscript -- you-- Oh, my! You translated it. Funny story about that-- [giggling] When I said it was a stroke of luck that whoever dug it up didn't know what they had... [laughing] It was a trap. Someone on the same road as you and I just waiting to see who'd take the bait. Someone-- Colton! You know the bastard? He's not rotting in hell? Close enough though. He's in an asylum. He's not doing very well. He's lucky. I've translated every word in here a hundred times. I'm ready to take the final step, but you-- you were always stronger at this. That's why I brought you here, professor. I'm guessing at some of the meanings, but we only get one chance. At what? What's the point? Read it. If you can perfect my translations, then you'll see. And so will everybody else. [footsteps] We have a situation, Mr. Ramdas. Hmm. I'll let you get to work. We're so close, my old friend. [suspense music] My God! Dawn! I never thought I'd see you again. Sanjay, untie me before that woman comes back again. What is happening? Don't worry about her. - But-- - Dawn, you are safe. I promise you. And so is Sam. She's working on something right now. It's very important. Take me to her. I need to talk to her. She's really busy, Dawn. I don't think it's the right time. She hurt someone in the hospital. I need to speak to her. Dawn, I really think you should come back at another time. Take me to her. Yeah. Of course. Right this way. I see why you never told me what you were doing here. Would you have done all this if you would have known? I don't think we were meant to do this, Sanjay. It was locked in there for a reason, right? This entity thought-- You speak of our God, professor. This is literally infinite knowledge. All the world's problems could be solved in an instant. All we have to do is let that knowledge into our world, to allow humanity to evolve in the footsteps of the scribe. But we don't know what it means. We don't have any idea what the costs might be. Professor, we could achieve world peace, an end to disease, anything we can imagine and much more that we can't. This is the patron of science and wisdom. It's a God, Sanjay, your words. We don't know what this entails. What happened to careful scholarship? Science harnessed the power of the atom, but science brought us to the brink of nuclear war. - How is that any different? - Did you read this? All of it? Did anything in there scare you? This is our chance to advance human society into a golden egg. You-- You finished the translation. It was the only way to know what it meant. I had to finish it. My God, professor. You've given the world a great gift. Sanjay, you're hurt. It's nothing. Just a little blood. That's a lot of blood. No time. Let's begin. What are you not telling me? That woman that came in... What happened? What did you do? [suspense music] What happened to you? [woman] Ah, professor! You should return to the theatre. What happened? What was the situation that you mentioned to Sanjay? Return to the theatre, now! Answer my fucking question! Very well then, right this way. [evil laugh] [screaming] Oh, you're not supposed to be in here. Get back! Get the fuck back! Get back! Stay away! [crying] Oh, my God! Oh, my God! No... You! What did you do? What did you do? Oh, my God! Oh, my God! No, no... Why? Oh, God! No! No... No... Wake up. Please, wake up. I love you. Wake up, just wake up. Please, baby, wake up. No! I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. You! You! You! Did you do this? No, no, no, no. Who did this? Tell me now. Your student was in here and he came out of... If you-- If you touch her body, if you start whatever the fucking hell ritual you were doing, if you start it again, I'm going to come up here and I am going to do worse to you than I did to the guard downstairs. Do you understand? What did you do to the guard? What did you do to her? Go look. Go look. I love you. [crying] Oh, God! Oh, Dawn... I'm sorry. I'm sorry. [speaking in foreign language] You killed her! How could you? How could you do that to her? To me? Dawn, she cared for you. She cared for you and you killed her for what? [deep male voice] My students, come and drink the sweetest nectar which is true knowledge. Yes, we humbly offer ourselves to you, who knows the two lands. The machinery of this reality lies rusted and choked with dust. We shall reawaken it to its purpose. Sanjay, you can't let this happen. You have to stop it. Do you know nothing? We are before the-- Let the [indistinct] become my, oh, self-begotten. [deep male voice] Into this land of shadows and smoke, we shall pour the cold light of truth. [speaking in foreign language] No! No. No! No! Sanjay... [speaking in foreign language] Sanjay, this isn't you! No, why would you do it? No, what happened to you? What happened to the guy who talked Dawn into making donuts at 3 a.m. while we were translating some stupid pointless books? Remember, remember when those-- when those stupid racist fucks jumped you? And I maced them? I maced them. And when they came up and said that they were really going to fuck me straight and you stopped them? And then you walked me home and you stayed with me until I was okay? Please, remember... "Us against the world," right? [emotional music] Sam! Sam! I'm sorry! I-- I-- I killed them. So many people died. It's inside me. I can't. No! No! No! Oh, God! I'm sorry. [Sam crying] No! No! No! No! It's okay. I'm sorry. I love you, old friend. [Sam yelling] Thank you, Sam. You... are always... Smarter. [screaming] [suspense music] [knock on the door, door opening] Ah, Miss Bishop! Please, come in. I'll just grab my keys. Actually, um, I'm here to see Samantha Rand. Professor Rand? Ah, yes, well, she's not in the best of conditions. I, uh-- Of course. If you'll just follow me. Oh, my God... Professor? [whispering] It takes everything for a bit of knowledge. It takes everything, everything for a bit of knowledge. Everything. [shrink] That's about all she says. Compulsive repetition. It takes everything for a bit of knowledge. Everything, everything. Professor, can you hear me? Is there anything that I can do for you? I'm so sorry. It takes everything, everything. Takes, takes, takes, everything. Takes everything for a bit of knowledge.

It's too early to hope for a breakthrough, but... I stopped hoping for that a long time ago. You're a real bastard, you know that? Chloe, you were raised better than to speak that way. Her wife is dead and she's now in a padded cell down the hall. Does that even matter to you? Does that even register? Yes. Look, I feel... deep gratitude for both of them and for you. I cannot be more proud of you. Chloe, you've done a good thing here. Do you understand me? We've laid one more stone on the path to enlightenment. To expect anything else would be hubris. Chloe... Look at me. Don't mourn too long. This falls on you, to send the next seeker on their path. [suspense music] [door closing]
