What's wrong? Are you seriously going to wear that? Why not? You don't go to the club wearing jeans. Darn it, you! Dinda, come here. - What is it? - Just sit! Now close your eyes. Dinda, your birthday is coming soon. What do you want me to get you? This is not like you. You don't need to. Stay still! - All right. - You messed this up. But, seriously, no need to get me anything. I mean, you still ask your mom for money. I've been saving up for your present, you know. So sweet of you. Really though, don't worry about me, your boyfriend needs you more. He's still coming tonight? Why should I care? Of course you should. Look, he wears the other half with your name on it. Gross! Look. I don't need this anymore. You're so dramatic. What's wrong anyway? You're fighting? Pout your lips. Let's see how soon you guys make up. Hey, not too much. See, you're messing it up. You barely have enough for you and your brother. So just this once... Once a year, let me buy you something. Please? Just once a year? So, what do you want? Done. Pretty, right? Smile! They're here? I don't know. Let's check it out. I'm going first. - Hi! - Hi! We're going now? Let's drink here first, then we go. Why don't we go and drink there? Because it's expensive. - What a cheapskate! - Why did you say that? Rosa, is he with you? Nope. Just kidding, he is. - Is she being serious? - Hello? Are you going to stay there? Who are those guys? I thought we were going just with Rosa and her boyfriend? It's okay. They must be Rosa and Gerry's friends. It's not like we get to hang out with them often. Right? But, is it okay? Your mom? As long as you don't tell her. Promise? Okay. All right, come on. - Cheers. - Cheers! Hey! What are you doing? What are you... Come here! Kara? Kara! Kara? Kara? Hello, aunty? Do you know where Kara is? I don't know. Is everything okay? Kara isn't here. I've been calling, but couldn't get through. What were you girls doing here? How did my apartment get this messed up? I don't know. You're not lying, are you? It's not like Kara. Okay, let me try to find out what happened. Thank you, Dinda. MISSING PERSON MISSING PERSON We haven't talked since Kara disappeared. Nothing to talk about. Do you think Kara ran away? From what? You know how strict her mom is. You are too. What do you mean? Kara told me. That's because I care about her. MISSING PERSON I should've done more to protect her. Right, you should have. It's been a month, Dinda. Do you think there is still hope? What did you guys really do that night? I've explained everything to the police. - I know, but... - I don't care if you don't believe me. Dinda, you're not the only one who misses Kara. We're closed. - Granny... - Come back here tomorrow. I have something to ask you. Here. My daughter. It's about my daughter. You don't look for a missing person here. I've made a report to the police. I've searched everywhere and couldn't find her. Please, it's for my daughter. Please? Granny. Come here. Your daughter... is dead. - Pass here! - Here! Goal! Ari? Ari? Ari? Ari, you're so sneaky. Happy birthday, Dinda. Oh, my God, Ari. You're so thoughtful. Make a wish first. Done. Let me blow the candle. Help me with this one. You're not going to sleep? I'm about to. Let's sleep. You'll never leave me like Mom and Dad, right? Hey, what kind of question is that? Mom and Dad didn't leave us. They went to a better place. Don't leave to that better place, okay? But if you do, take me with you. - You, stop talking like that. - Let me go. I'll never leave you. Dinda... Okay, let's sleep. It's late. KARA'S MOM Sir! Sir! Oh, it's you again. Have you taken care of the water? - We have, ma'am, but... - Why does it still reek? I've reported to the building management. We'll check again... Do you know how much I pay for my rent? I can't shower. I can't eat. Come in. How have you been, Aunty? Please get the teacup in the kitchen for me. Thank you, Dinda. Is this for Kara? Yes. But... We don't know what really happened to Kara. I know, Dinda. I know. Dinda, I see you as my own daughter. And I was always grateful that Kara had you as a friend. So for the last time, Dinda, I'm begging you. Tell me where Kara is. I'm sorry, Aunty, but I honestly don't know. This has been too long. And I'm ready for the truth. Whatever happened to Kara, I only want her to rest in peace. Don't you feel sorry for Kara? What are you talking about? Where did you hear it? I promise, I will never tell anyone. If I knew, why would I not tell you? Aunty? Aunty? I'm sorry. I promise... Wisnu, Gerry, Marko, Rosa. And especially you! There's no way none of you don't know where my daughter is! I promise I will look for Kara and find her. This is all your fault! Rot in hell! What's wrong with your friend? What do you mean? Is she sick? Which friend? The one next to you. I'm not with anyone. Don't try to scare me. What do you see? Do you really want to know? Not really. No, thanks. So stupid. Good night, sir. Please, stay closed. Please, stay closed. Help! Help! Somebody, open the door! Help! It's not like you to take a bath this early, Ari. Dinda, hurry up. I need to shower now, or I'll be late. Dinda. What happened to you earlier? - It was nothing. - What do you mean nothing? Dinda, you can talk to me about anything. Come on, tell me. Dinda. Dinda. Dinda. Here, let me tell you this, I'm totally fine. Trust me, okay? Dinda, look at that granny there, she's staring at us. Just ignore her. Let's go. Ari, later... Stop fooling around. That granny was staring at you. So weird. Hey, wait. Let's go. - Come on board. - Hurry. Go. Dinda, the granny from before gave me this. She said it's for you. What's that? Just throw it away. - But why? It'd be such a waste. - Listen to me and throw it away. Don't keep it! - What are you so busy watching? - What? - Let me see. - It's nothing. No. - I want to see. - No. Tell the driver to stop now, or you'll miss it. Driver, pull over! - Be careful! - Bye. Where? I don't see anything. This, right here. What do you think this is? - Where? - Here. This can be anything, Dinda. Kara came to me last night. What? What are you talking about? So you're saying this is Kara's ghost? Is that it? Do you even hear yourself? I'm sure it was her. I heard her voice. I could feel her. So you're saying Kara has turned into a ghost, and the ghost killed Wisnu? - That's what you mean, right? - I know this sounds crazy. Not only crazy, you're out of line, you know? What if her mother heard what you just said? Then please listen to me. I need you to believe me because I need your help. - How can I even help? - Well, we have to find Kara. Dinda, even the police can't find her until now. What can we do? So you've given up? - That's not what I meant. - Driver, can you pull over, please? Dinda. I came to you because I thought you cared about Kara. But if you don't want to do it, I'll do it myself. Dinda. Dinda. Dinda showed me this video. - I didn't trust her at first. - But is this really her? - Don't be stupid. - I know it's her. We understand Kara was your girlfriend, but this is not right. Just look at the video, okay? DEEPEST CONDOLENCES Do we have to, babe? So you're saying Wisnu's death is related to Kara? Don't you think Wisnu's death is odd? Seriously, Putra? Can you explain Wisnu's death? Here, watch it. - I saw it. - Watch it carefully. Look at this part. If it was Kara, what did Wisnu do to deserve it? You guys should've known better. What do you mean? Something must've happened to Kara that night. - Of course, she just disappeared. - You really don't know where she left? I don't know. After you left, we both left, too. But before that, she was still there, right? With who? Didn't you state in the police report that Kara was with Wisnu? - I thought Wisnu had left? - Hold on. What makes you think it was her? I went to see Kara's mom yesterday, and saw her mom holding a ceremony for her. A ceremony? And after that, I saw Kara as a ghost. - Where? - In my flat. You said a ghost? You're crazy! What if she is really dead? I don't care, not my problem. Let's get out of here, babe. Babe, can I stay at your house tonight? I don't mind, but don't you want to go home? No one's at home, I'm scared. But you have a housekeeper. Please? Just tonight? Okay. - Thank you. - Yes, thank you. Turn left, and forward. Thank you. - Babe, do you think Dinda has a point? - Stop it, don't bring that up. You're already skittish. But you saw Wisnu, don't you find it weird? I do. But what are we supposed to do? We can't ask Kara, she's dead. But you heard it yourself, she was screaming that night. No, I didn't hear anything. And I don't want to get involved. It has nothing to do with us. I still can't believe Wisnu could do that to Dinda, and also Marko... Stop it! Can you stop talking about it? Did you even listen to me? Babe! What was that? There's nothing there. What should we do? What? Babe, get in the car! Did you see what it was? ROSA BABE Babe, you left me here! Hey, open the door! Open the door! Open up! Gosh, what is it? You're asking me? You're too loud, people are trying to sleep. What were you even doing? Playing football? Yes, I was playing with balls and you interrupted me. Stop playing football this late. - You're too cute. - Don't play with me! I have school tomorrow, you know. Gosh, I was playing until you bothered me! Don't get loud again or else... Are you threatening me? Go home! Go to sleep! Wash your feet! And don't forget to wipe your bottom! You wipe your bottom! You little rascal. Dinda, open the door! Dinda! Open the door! Ari? - Dinda. - Ari? Ari? Get back in, quick! Why? What's going on? Ari! Ari! Ari! What happened, Ari? What happened? Are you okay? No, Dinda. Rosa? Dinda. What should we do now? You remember what Kara wore that night? And the woman you hit earlier? But we went out of the car and there was no one. But then Gerry was terrified and drove away by himself. Do you think... it was Kara? But what did Gerry do wrong? What did he do wrong? What did I do wrong? First it was Wisnu, now Gerry. Then who's next? Me? You? Who else? I'm scared now that Gerry isn't here. Gerry is gone, I'm so scared. I don't know what to do anymore. I don't know either. Marko is not coming? He should be. I'll call him now. His phone is inactive. Are we still waiting for someone to come? No, we're not. So this spirit has been haunting all of you... since your friend went missing? And no one was able to find her? Not yet. What was she like? Kara. You know something? Where is she now? Do any of you know what Hong Gui is? A woman who commits suicide in a red dress so her spirit can come back for revenge. She will never stop until her revenge is fulfilled. You must find her dead body soon... or each one of you will die. This is why we came to you, we don't know where else to look. I can't help you find Kara, but we can ask her. Who among you was the closest to her? I'd say it's me. Call her name. Kara... Kara? Kara? Kara? Kara? Kara? Dinda! Rosa? Putra? Granny? Help! Dinda! Help! Dinda! Dinda! Dinda! Dinda! Rosa! Rosa! What all of you seek... - Granny? - Is where it all started. Putra! Putra. Putra! We have to go to Kara's apartment. What do you want to do now? You heard what Granny Wong said. You still believe her after what happened? "Where it all started." It must be her apartment. She went missing since that night, from that place. If she was really there, the police would've found her. We've gone this far, we're running out of time. I don't want to die like Gerry and Wisnu. My brother needs me. Young man, please hold the door for us. Come here, quickly. Thank you. This belonged to Kara. I know you two wore a matching piece. Do you still wear yours? I keep it at home ever since she's gone. I know this must be difficult for you, Putra. I used to tease Kara a lot... about you two being a cheesy couple. But now I realize how much this necklace means to you. Forgive me, Dinda. If only I was there that night. None of this would've happened. It wasn't your fault. I should've stayed by her side that night. Dinda... What actually happened that night? That night, we were drinking at her apartment before our plan to go to the club. Things started to get blurry for me. What are you doing? Kara? Kara! I haven't seen her ever since that night. Why did you never report Wisnu for what he did to you? What for? So he can be held accountable! It's pointless. I don't have any evidence. After all, I'm a nobody. I just want to forget this whole thing. And that would never bring Kara back anyway. When you left the apartment, did you see her? I don't know. - Either you saw her or you didn't. - No! I didn't see her. Could she have been with Marko? Kara! Kara! Kara! Dinda! Last night at Granny Wong's place... I saw Kara. You saw her? I could feel what she was going through. What did you see? Dinda! Marko! Dinda! Dinda! Dinda! What did you see? Kara being raped by Marko. He needs to be held responsible for this. I want you to forget everything that happened that night. Let me put an end to this myself. I know this isn't easy for you. But we haven't found Kara and Marko is the one who knows the answer. I will find him. Remember, Putra, we're in this together. Dinda. Kara was happy, wasn't she? Dinda. Hi. What are you cooking? Vegetable soup, your favorite. Why did you come home this late? I just joined the basketball club. Right, I totally forgot. No wonder you're so stinky. All right, why don't you clean up? Ari, don't take too long in the shower. Help! Help! Ari, stop playing with the water. Ari, hurry up. Don't you want to have dinner? Ari? Hello, Dinda? It's not over. Hello? What happened? Where are you? Are you home? I'm coming over. We're all going to die if we don't find Kara. But how? I don't know what else to do. Wait for me. I'll be there right away. Dinda? Dinda? Putra, I think I know where she is. Where? In her apartment. Where it all started. But we went there. I know, but we need to go there again. You remember what Granny Wong said? What we're looking for is where it all started. But we only found her mother there. But we're looking for Kara, not her mother. Let's meet up at the apartment. Okay. Please look after him. - What if something happens? - I'll pick him up later, okay? Thanks. Kara! Dinda? Dinda? Putra! She's here! Kara is here! Putra, isn't this... Putra... Putra! Why are you doing this? Putra! Putra, open the hatch! Putra! Open it! I'm sorry, Kara. Putra? Putra. Putra. Help me. Putra! Please, help me. Putra... Open it, Putra! Open it! Putra! It's too late, Dinda! It shouldn't have been like this! Putra! I was wrong. I loved her too much. If you really loved her, you wouldn't have done any of this! I'm really sorry, Dinda. But Kara made me do this! You're wrong! Please open this! I'm begging you! Kara would never betray you. And what did I ever do to you? I promise I won't tell anyone! - Putra, don't do this. Please open it. - Putra! I don't want this to happen again. Marko? Marko! Open it! I did this because you raped my girlfriend! How many more people need to die? You're sick! - Dinda! - Do you want her to turn you in? Marko, help me! Marko! Marko, help me! You better go downstairs and make sure that there is no evidence of Dinda! You didn't do it, Marko! It was Putra! He killed Kara! He set you up! Marko! Help! Kara. Kara? Crap. Kara, wake up. Kara? Kara? Putra... - Putra... - What were you two doing? Putra, Kara is... What happened to her? I don't know. When I woke up, - she was already like this. - Kara? Kara? Kara? Kara? Kara! - Putra? - Kara! What did you do to her? What happened last night? I don't know! You're finished! Putra, who are you going to call? Please spare me. I'll take full responsibility for this. If I were you... I would get rid of her body right now. Screw you! It was you all along! You lied to me! Go to hell. Marko! Help me! Dinda! Dinda! Dinda! Dinda! I'm begging you, Dinda. Please! Dinda! Dinda. Dinda... Putra, this isn't you. It is truly me! Kara? All right.
