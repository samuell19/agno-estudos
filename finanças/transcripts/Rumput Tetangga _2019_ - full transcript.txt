IF I WERE YOU Wake up, Kir. The kids have to go to school. -We have Mbok, Ben. -It's been a month since Mbok left. Oh, my God! We're late! Hurry. Wake the kids, I'll cook. Kir. -I'll be going in a minute. -You have to drop the kids to school. I can't, I'm in a hurry. Still waiting on a taxi. I thought today I could... Forget it. -Could what? -Free-- I'm kidding, Ben. This is my job, anyway. I'm sorry I've been so busy lately. You know, Mr. Tanoto asks for a daily evaluation. Can you forgive me? It's okay, keep up your hard work so we can get the bonus to go to Singapore. Singapore? Are you sure you want to go to Singapore? It would be better if we use the money for-- I'm joking, Ben. We'd better use the money for the house and car payments, right? I'm going. Here, let me kiss you. -My face is dirty, Ben. -It's okay, come here. -Seriously? -Of course. Just kidding, Kir. Regga. Windy. Honey, what happened to your hair? Mom, today I want to have my hair like my idol, Rihanna. What if it looks like a Taylor Swift pony tail? I like Rihanna. Why don't you become fans of Tukul, that would be easier. Mama, there's a fire. What? It's so scary. So close. Mom! Windy. She's allergic to peanuts. Windy, stop. Spit it out, don't eat it. It's burnt, Mom. -I want to sit in the front, my turn. -But I'm older. Stop fighting. Let's go. -Hi, Kirana. -Hi, Lidya. -Windy, Mom. -What about her? -You left her. -Oh, my God. Windy. Come. Get in, smart girl. Rihanna sits in the front seat. Tukul sits in the back seat, right? I sit on the front seat every day. You move! We're late. Hurry. Hurry. Run. Quick. You're late. Please, open the gate, sir. Please open it, sir. Can't do it, ma'am. Miss Rhonda will be angry. Miss Rhonda is fierce, just like a hungry tiger. Miss Rhonda is fierce, but you're so kind. -Please, it's the last time we'll be late. -One last time? Late never again? -I am kind, right? So kind? -You truly are. I can't do that, a rule is a rule. If Miss Rhonda says no, it means no. I'm obeying Miss Rhonda. Good morning, kind Miss Rhonda. Welcome, Mrs. Sisca. I'm sorry, ma'am, for being late. It's okay, I'm grateful that you're taking the time to speak to our children. It's my pleasure, ma'am. I'm so excited. I'd like to share my experiences as a movie producer, ma'am. Especially to young girls. We must educate young girls. They shouldn't be satisfied with just becoming housewives. Why? Because we have the same opportunity. Whatever we want, whatever career we want, we can do it. Am I right? Don't you agree? So... -Please, come in. -Sisca. Sisca Malandouw. Kirana Permatasari? Oh, my God. What are the chances of us meeting here? This is your children's school? Are they your children? Hello, I'm Sisca. We used to be in the same group, friends of your mother. We were called Screaming Queens. We were the most popular. Your mother was the chairman of the Student Board and the cheerleaders. She got good grades, she was so cool. Do you still see other girls form the Screaming Queens? Let me get your number. Okay? -My WhatsApp isn't working. -Mrs. Sisca... Sorry, ma'am, one second. Are you still seeing Yanti and Indah? They must be thrilled to see you. You know Yanti? Yanti, now, her rendang is everywhere. And Indah, her batik boutique is selling well. So cool. Where have you been? I know, usually people who are as quiet as you are the most successful. Of course she's so quiet, you won't stop talking. I'm sorry, ma'am, I'm gonna be quiet in order to be successful. Mrs. Sisca, finish the reunion later. The children are waiting. Please come in. Mr. Sueb, take Mrs. Sisca to the classroom. Okay, Na. I've to go, I'm running late. Regga, Windy, come inside. Ma'am, I want to talk to you in the office. What do you think of Regga's grade, ma'am? They're dropping. Way below the standard. We should feel sad. If we get paid, then we should be happy. Is there a problem at home? Fights with your husband? Divorce? Another woman? Or are you the one with another man? So, you are a playgirl. Sorry, I'm just joking. There's something more important. The role of the school is indeed important in a child's education. But it is more important for you as a parent to supervise your children while they study at home. -Especially since you don't work. -I'm working, I'm a housewife. Do you get paid? No, right? So you have a lot of time to supervise your children strictly. Don't just pay attention to your clothes. Children need more attention, too. Who likes watching cartoons? Me! -Who wants to make movies? -Me! You should study hard. You should... INDONESIAN CUISINE YANTI'S RENDANG It turns out that Kirana Permatasari is just a housewife. Miss? -The total is 375,000 rupiah. -Okay. What are you looking at? It's Lidya. She's so cool, Ben. Good career, successful, future mom. You... you're cool, too. You take care of me, take care of the children. Thank you. -But a little slow. -It smells bad. How can I not be slow? I spend my time smelling your farts. You. Come on. Kir, I set every clock in this house 30 minutes ahead. So you won't be late anymore. Ben, did you underestimate me? I can wake up early. Regga, Windy. Time for dinner. -Did you call Mbok Diah? -She didn't pick up. It seems she's mad. We can't be too hard on her. I told her nicely. She can't do the laundry, all my clothes were ruined. -Let's get a new maid. -No need, Ben. I can do it myself. You said it yourself, we must be more efficient. I... have... a... school... holiday... Regga, why do you read it like that? Read it normally. I'm confused, Mom. All the letters are jumbled. What? Try again. "Saturday... School..." Right, school. Regga suffers from dyslexia, though it's in an early stage. This time he needs an intensive treatment and attention from both of you. It's okay. The doctor said he would be fine. Okay? But it is so expensive, Ben. Should I get a job? No. If you worked, who would take care of the children? Poor Regga. He needs you the most, Kir. I know you're worried. But trust me. Inshallah, there's a way out. Okay? Come. Let me massage you. Whatever happens, we'll face it together. That's gross, Kir. "Kir"? Can't you give me a romantic nickname? Dear, honey, or Mammy. A nickname is not important. It's how I feel about you. -Playboy. -Gross. Diana. DIANA - Just got back from Europe. Let's meet! She wants to meet up. She just got back from Europe. She's so great. She works in PR. Look. She's so beautiful, Ben. She had a crush on you back in high school. Why did you say no to her? You could've been her husband. She is still single. Could it be that her heart is still stuck on you? -But I'm stuck with you, Kir. -"Kir"? Am I Bokir? -I'm going to take the children to bed. -Me? I mean, I'll follow. Gross. Na, these are for Windy and Regga. I miss them so. Thank you Hold on. Yes, Indra. Don't forget to bring Mr. Gunawan's case file. So I know what kind of brand image will fit the most. Thank you. Indra is too slow. Is he our junior? My secretary in the Student Board? I'm looking for the right moment to fire him. Our school will hold a reunion. Why don't you come this time? I'm the chairman of the event. It will be exciting. We will have a costume party. Nope. Why? Not in the mood? Or not confident? You told me yourself, you're not comfortable with you being just a housewife. Actually... -Shit. -What? -That's Bram. Why is he here? -That's the Bram who had a crush on you? He's handsome. He seems like a nice person. He's nice and handsome. But I'm not feeling it, I can't imagine my life with him. He's coming. -Hi, Di. How are you? -Good. This is Kirana, my high school friend. Hi, Bram. -Kirana. -Nice meeting you. By the way, you look prettier since you came back from Europe. My invitation for dinner is still open. Please, let me know. Bram is a good match for you. What are you waiting for? Are you afraid of becoming just a housewife like me? If I had kids like Regga and Windy, it wouldn't be a problem for me. Bring your kids to my new apartment. -Another new apartment? -Indra is here. -Hi, Indra. -Hi, Miss Kirana. Did you bring the file? You didn't? How could you? I'm sorry, miss. I'll ask Inge to bring it. Your tie is crooked and doesn't match. Not a good image in front of the client. -Oh, my God. -Did you forget? I'm sorry, miss. I really am. This is your invitation, miss, with the souvenirs. I forgot. Thank you, Indra. Please come, miss. It's a Student Board reunion. Our friends in high school. I will be there, too. It will be great. By the way, it would be cooler if the tie was dark blue. Is that so? Thank you, miss. -Hurry up, Indra. We're late. -Excuse me, miss. -Bye, Na. -Bye, Di. Yes. You guys finally made it, Na. Ben. -You're so beautiful, Na. -Thank you. Ben, let me take Kirana for while. We want to hang out. Can we? -Hi. -Hey, Ben. I'm happy you finally made it. Thumbs up. I just fired him. Can you imagine? He made an appointment with the client very early in the morning. He knows that we're having a party tonight. Poor Indra. Why pity him? You make me look like I'm the bad person. If you worked with him, you would not be able to stand him either. You would be firing him, too. Do you remember him? Tama? Tamtama Eka Putra, he is the most promising young politician. Didn't he repeat his class twice? The past is not important. The most important thing right now is he has 4.3 million followers. He is a candidate for the position of Jakarta's vice governor. -Wasn't he in the Student Board, too? -Just to get closer to you. Can you imagine if you were with him? Probably your name won't be Kirana Permatasari. Instead, Kirana Eka Putra... Now you're not the wife of a car salesman, but the wife of the future vice governor of Jakarta. Isn't that cool? He's waving at you, right? -So, now what? -Kirana. You're so cute. It's so hard! -Where have you been? -Yeah. You've been absent twice, and now you've appeared. If we knew you'd come, we'd have worn the same costume. Princesses. It doesn't matter. The important thing is all the Screaming Queens are here. By the way, I've got something to do there. I'll be right back. We haven't even made a Boomerang for Instagram. Just because she's the chairman of the committee. -Where have you been for all this time? -Did you know? Diana said she had become a PR consultant in a well-known company. And she had a lot of clients. Why didn't you say it when we met at school? You know what? She still manages the time to take the kids to school. I can't stand it. Diana. I'll see you later. -Why did you have to lie? -What do you mean? You told everyone I'm a successful PR consultant. Do you want me to say you're just a housewife? No, right? -What's wrong with being a housewife? -They will look down on you. Come on, Na. It's okay. This is a reunion. It's not a big deal. Reunions are all about lying and bragging. So you don't need to feel bad about it. -Kirana. -Tama? I think it's going to start. I'm going in. The alumnus I wait for most is you. I'd like to say thank you for our time together at the Student Board. It made me who I am today. I also heard that you have become a successful PR consultant. Right? -We are all proud of you, Kirana. -I... You must have heard, I want to go on to become a vice governor candidate. And I need a good campaign manager. I'm sure you're the one. Well... It's a professional thing. Just tell me how much you want for the job. After all, the party is paying. -Tama, one moment, please. I need to go. -Kirana, can I have your card? Kir-- Sit down. Yes, you. Sit. MADAME SRI MENYAN FORECAST AND CHANGE YOUR FATE There's anxiety on your face. Can I help you? I don't need any help, Mom. "Mom"? Am I marrying your father? It's "Madam." -What is your name, dear? -Kirana. Well... Kirana. There's a cloud in your heart. A dark mist covering your life. Pick a card. No, I don't need a prophecy. -Well... what do you regret? -Regrets? I don't... Man is full of regrets. What regrets in your career? -I don't have a career. -Housewife. Then you're sorry for your household life now, Kirana. Pick a second card. Well... this is bad. What are your deepest desires, Kirana? -What do you mean? -If only... Follow my words. If only-- Kirana, follow my words. If only, when I graduated from communication school, I did not get married immediately, but instead started my career -and achieved my dreams. -Which is... Becoming a great PR consultant, no need to bother taking care of the child and husband, have a lot of money, live in a luxury apartment... No, it's just a joke. It's just a foolish dream, Madam. One's desires must be revealed once in a while. It must be done once in a while. Open the last card, Kirana. "Before the day changes, back to the starting point. Afterwards, there's no return." What does it mean? Later, you will understand. Keep it and open it later. If the card is black, be grateful for your life now. If the card is red, your wish is fulfilled, Kirana. -Kirana. -Ben. I've been looking for you. Let's go, it's going to start. Ben... Miss Kirana... I'm still sleepy, Ben. I'm Indra, miss. What are you doing... in my room? Last night you told me there will be a coordination meeting tomorrow and to wake you up at 6:30. -Where am I? -Your apartment, of course. Apartment? Where are my children? Children? You're not married yet, how would you have children? What are you, a turkey? Miss... Is this a dream? This is so real. THE BEST PR CONSULTANT IN JAKARTA If the card is black, be grateful for your life now. If the card is red, your wish is fulfilled, Kirana. So... all my wishes are... fulfilled? This is all real? What? It's not a dream. What? -How do I look, Indra? -What? -How do I look? -This is how Miss Kirana looks everyday. -This is your breakfast. -Nothing else? It's healthy food. Let me brief you before the meeting with Tama's campaign team. Tama? Tamtama Eka Putra? That's our client? Yeah. Wait a second. Seriously? I met Mr. Jokowi? -I'm so cool. -Please, take a look, miss. -Do you want to eat here or on the way? -I want vegetables with rice. Okay. -Which car do you want to use today? -What do you mean? Yes, do you want that car, this one, this little one, or that one? -What? These are all mine? -Of course. Excuse me, ma'am. Which car will you use? Indra, all my cars are cool. Too bad the driver isn't cool enough. Shit. Indra, we rented this big building, right? Rented? You own it. Did you forget that you're the CEO? Let's go. -Good morning, ma'am. -I'm so sorry. -You. -Yes, ma'am? Your tie is crooked, let me fix it. See? It's better, isn't it? Morning, ma'am. Morning, ma'am. Something wrong with my clothes, ma'am? -You have a nice batik. -Thank you, ma'am. -These are the files you asked for. -Okay. Here, Indra. No need to rush next time. Relax. -What's your name? -Inge, Inge Wisnubrata. She's your secretary. -Are you married? -No, I'm not. -Any boyfriend? -I don't have one. Indra seems to have a crush on you. He said you're beautiful. Thank you, miss. Why did you thank me? Tell it to the one who said it. Thank you, Indra. Thank you, Indra. -Respond. -Yes, you're welcome. Let me. Love is in the air. I'm going. Good morning, miss. Morning to you all. -Indra, are they Tama's team? -They are all your employees. Sit down, miss. Miss... Okay. Let's start the briefing. Who wants to start? Phillip? Okay. Why are you standing? Stay seated. It's okay. Good morning, everyone. Our client is one of the rising star-- Stop it. Can you speak Indonesian? Your English is a little bit off, isn't it? So our client is one of the most talented stars in the entertainment industry. -Tina Cempaka. -Wow, Tina Cempaka. Indra, it's so cool. She's my favorite artist. So cool. Go on. So, thanks to the brand that we're developing for her-- Sorry, Miss Kirana. I'm late. -My children were-- -What happened to them? Are they sick? No, ma'am. I had to take care of them. My maid had to go home. So I had to take them to my mom's house. I know you can't accept these kind of excuses. -How many kids do you have? -Three, ma'am. Can I see their picture? Sure. They're so adorable and cute. Their cheeks are chubby. You must be very busy. It's a handful for me with two kids. Okay. Sit down, Linda. Thank you, ma'am. Two kids? When did she get married? I don't know. Maybe she thinks of me and Inge as her children. Please ask her, does she still need a child? My mother has passed away. -Indra? -Yes, miss? Make a meeting at noon next time. Poor Linda. Okay, Lip. Go on. Okay. So this is the number one beauty product in Indonesia. Hold it. No snacks in here? Combro, misro or seblak? It's so empty. Tama and I, how close are we? -You look so happy. -I'm dead. If Ben saw this, he'd go mad. -He must be thinking I'm cheating. -Ben? Yeah. My husband, Ben. Benyamin Kristanto. I'm not married, right? You broke up with Ben when you went to Sydney for college. I broke up with Ben? He was desperate for two years, miss. Miss... Indra... Excuse me, miss. I just wanted to remind you of your lunch meeting now. Another meeting? We just had one. It was an internal meeting, miss. Miss Kirana indeed has appointments with several clients today. It's all in the schedule. What? It's so full. -Damn. Non-stop meetings. I'm hungry. -I already prepared the food. -Is this the food? -Yeah. -Nothing else? -It's a healthy diet. -What is that? -Padang food, ma'am. Okay, I'll take that. You take this salad. I already did the afternoon salat, ma'am. -All right. Take this. -Are we trading? For the campaign locations, as I said, we'll go to several places. Including, we're gonna clean garbage to keep up the good image of Mr. Samsul and Mr. Tama. And hopefully, we will achieve our goals. This is the end of my presentation. Hopefully, all of you are pleased, thank you. Kirana, what a great presentation. Yeah, thank you. About your idea of creating YouTube content, I've hired them. And starting today, they'll follow me everywhere I go. Yeah, I just presented it, but all the ideas came from Indra. Your presentation is something. Because of your ideas, this is what I've become. Really? You said it once to me in Sydney. Don't just criticize the government. If you dare to help, get involved. Help them get it down. Did I say that? Yes. Kirana, you're my inspiration. Excuse me, sir. Can you do it again? -Why? -The first one was blurred. One more time, miss. It's good. Standby. Action. -You're-- -Down a little, that one, sorry. Okay. You're my inspiration. Excuse me. You got that? I forgot to push the button. It wasn't recorded. It's okay, sir. We can retake it. But can we call her again? Idiot. -Mommy! -Regga! Windy! -Windy missed Mommy so much. -Me, too. -Mommy also misses you guys. -You must be tired. Let me massage you. Miss... It's from Mr. Tama. It was in the lobby. Tama is serious, isn't he? Miss Kirana should prepare to become the wife of a vice governor. -It won't happen. -But why? Because this is not my actual life. This is only a piece of dreams. A piece of wishful thinking that becomes a reality. I just taste it for a while, so I won't be wondering anymore. -All of this is not real, Indra. -Which one, miss? Thank you, Indra, for being my best personal assistant for one day. Bye. What are you talking about, miss? I'm not fired, right? Miss Kirana. Okay, Madam Sri Menyan. Thank you for the opportunity. I got to live my dreams today. Let me go back to my real life tomorrow. Regga and Windy must be missing their mom. Shit. Why am I still here? Miss... What are you doing here? I want to go home. Where to? To your hometown? The holiday season is still months away. -They are waiting for you. -Waiting for what? -There's a press conference at 9:00. -You're still here, too. Yes, you told me to. "Inge, for the preparation of the press conference, you should come to my place with Indra." -What press conference? -Tina Cempaka, our client, miss. She is accused of being a mistress. Last night, she was cyberbullied. -You whore. Sleazy actress. -What the hell? If her image turns like this, Tina's contract with the beauty products will fail and be canceled. Actually, Tina Cempaka is a nice person. I know why I'm still here. I have to settle this thing. Okay, we'll do the press conference. What should I say to the press, miss? I'm tired of saying "No comment." How will you answer it? Mr. Indra told me to say there's nothing between us. And we're only good friends. And that all the pictures are hoaxes, Photoshop edits. That means you're lying. You do have a relationship with that businessman, right? -Yeah, but-- -So, just tell them the truth. Are you serious? Calm down, everyone. To all the media people, today, Tina Cempaka will provide clarification regarding her scandal. You once said that creating an image means creating an illusion. So if it's not match to reality, it doesn't need to be. So? Why did we ask Tina to tell the truth? -I'm really tense, Indra. I'm sorry. -Yes. My apologies to Mr. Adrian's family. For I have caused chaos and unrest in his family. I feel guilty, and I promise I will not continue our relationship. I hope, after this, Mr. Adrian and his family will be harmonious and happy. Thank you. So, your affair is true? Oh, my God. Even her acting in a TV show can't be this good. You're right, miss. Look, her Insta story is gaining a lot of positive comments. -Her haters are quiet. -It's true. A woman who admits her mistakes and dares to apologize to the other woman will invite sympathy from many people. -I see. -Okay, my job is done. Not yet, miss. You still have meetings. Miss... Meeting at the Mulia at 2:00. At 4:00 p.m., you have a meeting about Hotel Acacia's new image. -Then, you'll go to the salon at 6, and-- -Salon? Yes, because you want to get prepared for the charity dinner with Mr. Tama. You said it yourself that you wanted to appear all-out for Mr. Tama. Many journalists will be there. The gossip spreads quickly. "Special relationship." "Couple of the year." No way. Anyway, Inge, cancel everything. I want to go home. -She means her apartment? -Maybe. Let's go. -Yes, I'll go with you. -You two. Come, quick! Is this your house? How am I just finding out that Miss Kirana has a house here? Anyway, all of you are off today. It's up to you, see a movie or go sightseeing. Be free. You're free. Go on, have fun. If you like her, just tell her. Miss... what about tomorrow? Maybe tomorrow we won't meet again, Indra. Bye. Did you realize, Inge? Miss Kirana is acting weird. -Inge... -What? To a movie? Dinner? No? It's okay. Miss Inge, I'll go to the movies with you. No? It's okay. Wait a minute. Run the car, not the window. Mbok Diah. You're back. Oh, my God. I'm so happy you're back. -What? -Who are you, ma'am? Don't you recognize me? I'm Kirana. This is Benyamin Kristanto's house, right? -Regga and Windy are his children. -That's right. But, who are you? You're kidding, right? Diana? Diana with Ben? How could it be? How could-- What? Ma'am, who are you? What do you want? This is impossible. This is not reality, right? I don't want... -Security. -Mbok. -Security. -Stop it, please. Please, do not scream. I'll leave. But you don't have to scream. I'm not a bad person. You have to leave or I'll call the police. Okay, I'll leave. Kirana Permatasari? Lidya. Thank God, there's someone who recognizes me. Of course I know you. We were neighbors. -Of course-- -Back in Sydney. Sydney? -No, we-- -Yes, in Sydney. We were in the same dormitory, but only for a while. You were too smart so you graduated earlier. But I followed your career. You are such a great PR consultant. Where are you going? Let me take you. You are said to be a distinguished graduate of Sydney. You're such a role model for every girls who thinks of-- How is your baby, healthy? How'd you know? Is it showing? -I was forced to get pregnant, actually. -Forced? I didn't plan to get pregnant. But my husband insisted that if I didn't get pregnant, he wanted a divorce. He was very jealous to see our closest neighbor's life. -Ben and Diana? -Yes, you know them? He really hopes that I become like Diana, the perfect housewife. Why did he marry me if he wanted a woman like that? I-- -Should I go first? -Yes, you go first. -I really liked the movie. -Me, too. So did I. What a nice movie. But if I could choose, I'd prefer action movies. Yes, I really love action movies. I also like action movies. -Anyway, do you like horror movies? -No, I don't. It's scary. Unless I am with someone. -Yeah, I also don't-- -Can you shut up? -Which superhero do you like? -Superhero? I like Superman. -Superman? -Yes. He's cool, handsome and strong. I prefer Gatotkaca. Iron muscles-- Can you shut up? They're dating. It's okay. You can continue. Hi, everyone. This is our family activity-- Hello. Here's Mommy preparing breakfast. Hello, dear Mommy. Hi, dear. -And the kids getting ready for school. -Hello. Mommy, thank you for doing my hair like Rihanna. -Do you like it? -Of course. -Great. What about the breakfast? -Love it, too. You will take me to school, Dad? -Of course. You, too. -Okay. -Thank you, Dad. -Okay, let's eat. Bye. Let me wash the vegetables. There's a woman looking for Mr. Ben, ma'am. -A woman? Who was it? -Her name is... Kirana. -Kirana? -Yes. Here. -Do you want more coffee, sir? -Yes, please. Please.... let me go back. Let me wake up in my own room tomorrow morning. Mommy, are the kids already asleep? Yes, dear. You know what? Me and my sales team were called by Mr. Tanoto. I did what you suggested me to do. I protested. Then? Mr. Tanoto praised me. He said that I have big initiative. And he promoted me to the Head of Strategy. -Are you serious? -Yeah. Thank you, Mommy. I'm proud of you. I want us to be like this forever. Where are you going, anyway? I don't want to stay here! I want to go home! Miss Kirana. It's been three days since you've come in to work. Are you sick, miss? Go away, Indra! Where's Mommy? She hasn't arrived. Regga, Windy. Do you remember Mom? Mom misses you so much. -No way! -Let go of my sister! Stop it! What is this about? -Sir, let me hug my children. -Don't even try it, ma'am. -I'm their mother. -I know who their mother is. Her name is Mrs. Diana, she doesn't look like you. Miss Kirana, you should go to the office now. What are you doing here? The office is chaotic if you're not there. All the clients are angry because they can't meet you. All the staff are confused. No one dares to make a decision. Do you have the heart to watch what you have built be ruined like this? You'll never understand what I've been through. We will not understand if you don't want to tell us. Useless. You will not believe me. Go away. No, miss. I can't go back to the office if it's not with you. Yes, me too. Okay. If that is what you want... We're going to the office now. Are you going to work or talk? What are you smiling about? Your tie is crooked. We are working as PR consultants. Image is everything, all of it. That's where we make our living, what we sell. Pay attention to your image. Clothes, attitude, pay attention to detail. Do not embarrass this office. -Everybody understand? Do you understand? -Yes, ma'am. Where's Inge? What's taking her so long in the toilet? Get her. Since this year, the chart is decreasing, we decided to raise... Chew it. Are you done? Starting now, there'll be no snacks on the table. Understood? I'm, sorry, ma'am. I'm late. Child-related excuses again? If you can't do both, stay home. -Just be a housewife. -Yes, ma'am. Why did she turn nasty like this? I don't know. We need Mr. Tama. Tamtama effect. -If you want to date, just go outside. -Yes, miss. I'm sorry. What's with the silence? What did I just say? No more snacks, clean it up. Our schedules are tight. -Kirana. Surprise. -Tama? How did you get here? Yeah. Indra gave me access to your apartment. I have a surprise for you. Special dinner. Thank you for the dinner. I didn't see it coming. -But I need to be alone. -Okay. You should relax more. Okay? That's why I need to rest. -So you have to go home. -What about the dinner? I will eat it. I promise. You should eat. We're also a surprise, miss. May I leave, too? I'm also tired. But before that, any message to our YouTube viewers? Go. You're so wise, miss. Subscribe. Morning. You're late. What kind of socks are those? They don't match. That's embarrassing in front of our clients. One more thing... Pick it up. Never give your access key to anyone. Not even the future vice governor, okay? Okay, miss. What? -Today's schedule, miss. -Let me look at it myself. Arrange it logically, Inge. Why is it so tight? Am I a robot? -Yes, I think usually-- -Don't just think, use your heart. SPEAK AT ELEMENTARY SCHOOL What is this? I was invited to be a speaker at Budi Pekerti Elementary School? No, miss. Indra has canceled it. Why? -Indra. Indra. -Yes, miss? -My schedule at Budi Pekerti Elementary. -Yes, it's-- A student's parents recommended you, but I know Miss Kirana wouldn't want to go, so I canceled. That is my child's school! Inge, call the headmistress right now, Miss Rhonda. Tell her I'll come as a speaker there. Now! One more time. -Diana. -Kirana? Oh, my God. You look different. I barely recognized you. Honey, she is my high school friend. Her name is Auntie Kirana. -Auntie looks like-- -Regga. Windy. Ma'am. I think I saw you once, but I don't know where. Everywhere, because I'm a public figure, well-known. You must have seen me. -You're a celebrity. -Miss Kirana, welcome. -Miss Rhonda, I'm sorry I'm late. -It's okay, I was confused. Finding an alternate for a canceled speaker. But now you're here to speak to our children. It's okay, I'm happy to share my experience as a PR Consultant. Especially for girls. They must know early on that they should not be narrow-minded, not to just be satisfied being a housewife. Women nowadays must have high careers, and be successful. To be equal to men. What did you want to say? I-- Being a housewife is a choice, not a matter of a narrow or broad mind. -But-- -Interesting discussion. What time is it? Ma'am, the children are waiting in class. Please. Regga, Windy. Please go to your class. -Mommy will pick you up. -Okay, Mommy. Bye. Mrs. Diana, I'd like to speak with you in my office. I'll wait. -Please, Miss Kirana. -Miss Kirana. Diana, if Miss Rhonda talks about Regga's grades going down, please tell her he is dyslexic. Please, Miss Kirana. Okay, kids. My job is public relation consultant. So what I do is make people look cooler, so a lot of people will like them. Miss, you mean like my mom. My mom makes me cool. My hair is in a ponytail like Rihanna. So did my mom, miss. To get more friends, I bring more food to school to share with friends. -Right! -Kids... What your mama and daddy do is different from what I do. I was hired to do it. I mean, they pay me. It means you are a bad person. People ask for help, why are you asking for payment? You are bad. You are not sincere. My mom sincerely helps me. Shut up. That's not what I meant. Please, listen to me. Please. Be quiet. Quiet. Na... Diana. -How did it go? -It's... It went well. They all liked it. Especially Windy. Did she? What about you? Did you meet Mrs. Rhonda? Did you tell her that Regga is dyslexic? I did. Mrs. Rhonda actually praised Windy's and Regga's achievements at school. In fact, she asked me to take a seminar or class for mothers about how to teach children at home. Anyway, would you like to have dinner at my house? Dinner? Actually, it's Ben's idea. I told him I met you here. And then he asked me to invite you and Tama for dinner at our home tonight. Tama? Everyone knows about your relationship with Tama. Everybody talks about it on Instagram. BEN, HUSBAND TAMA WILL COME TO DINNER Tama said okay. Ben spoke with him. Lately, Ben and Tama often communicate. Tama bought several cars from Ben. So, let's have dinner tonight. I will cook something special for you. You can cook? Good evening. We're so happy. Our humble home is visited by a candidate for vice-governor and his partner. Well, as advised by my personal consultant, she said I have to, somehow, gather votes. Don't worry, Tama, Ben and I will vote for you. Yes. -Where's Ben? -Ben's inside, preparing the dinner. Regga. Windy. Come here, honey. They're Mom and Dad's friends. This is Uncle Tama and Auntie Kirana, remember? Say hello to them. Why didn't you greet them, Windy? I don't want to, Mommy. Auntie Kirana was mean at my school. Why did you say that? Auntie Kirana isn't that fierce. Greet her. Okay. -Nice girl. -Okay. Now, go to your room. Mommy's friend's mustache is so tacky. -I'm sorry. Kids nowadays. -It's okay. -Let's go inside. -Please. -This is it. Roasted chicken à la Diana. -It looks delicious. You're great, Diana. Thanks to Ben. He always says my cooking is delicious. So, I feel motivated to try all kinds of cooking. But my taste and theirs are different. If it doesn't taste good, just say it. Is it okay? It's okay, dear. Where are the kids? They had their dinner. They're doing their homework. -Where's the water, Mommy? -Gosh. I forgot. Let me get it. Wait, allow me. -I'm sorry. It's an old habit. -It's okay. Me, too. But, since you're special guests, let me bring the water. -Come on, please. -Let's eat, I'm hungry. Please, don't bother. It's okay. It's our duty to serve as an official. Incredible. Thank you for having us for dinner, Ben and Diana. We're the ones who should thank you, having special guests. The future vice governor and his future wife. -Are you okay? -I'm fine. Excuse me for a moment. I'll take the kids to bed. -Me? -You... Excuse me. Okay, Mommy. Do you want you coffee with sugar or without sugar? -With sugar, please. -As sweet as your story of getting Kirana. In a minute. They're so awesome. A profile of a harmonious young couple. -I hope someday we can be-- -I'll help them clean up. Hello? Yes, Mr. Guntur. It's not a problem, sir. Number one or two, they're only numbers. -Yes. What? Ben, I'm going outside. -Okay. Please, don't bother. Leave it to Mommy. -I mean, Diana. -It's okay. -Where is that special coffee? -It's here. It's special, so I can smell it. Thank you. -How's your work, Ben? -Not bad. I have a celebration today. What celebration? I got a promotion. I was appointed as the Head of Sales in Southeast Asia. -You're great. -You, too. I heard a lot about you, that your career is now-- Ben. I'm sorry. I wasn't a good partner. I didn't support you. If it's about our breakup in high school, no need to be sorry, you're not wrong. It's the way our life is supposed to be. Besides, now I'm happy, seeing you with Tama. You're such a perfect couple. Diana and I are waiting for the invitation. -Now, repeat after Mommy. -Okay. Hair, mouth, nose, eyes, ears, stomach. Gosh. I'm wrong. -Okay, now it's my turn. -Okay. Mouth. -You won. One more time. -Okay. -It's my turn. -Okay. Eyes! Get ready. You win again. I love Mommy so much. Mommy loves you, too. But now, we have to sleep. We'll do this again tomorrow. Now go to sleep. -Mommy, where's my princess? -This is my princess. -Pleasant night, thank you. -Safe ride, Tam. Thank you. Bye. -Bye. -Come, Mommy. Are you okay, Kirana? Okay. If this is about the surprise the other day, I'm sorry. It's not about that. So, what is it? This is not my life. I'm the one who should've been in that house. -What do you mean? -I... It's okay. Just take me home, Tama. Miss... You're such a good assistant, Indra. I called you, you showed up. What's the matter, miss? Why did you do this? Madam Sri Menyan? This is the life that I wanted. But this is not the life I needed. I need my family. My past life, Indra. Now, I'm stuck in this life. I can't go back. I knew you wouldn't believe my story. I don't know where Madam Sri Menyan is. I can't find her anywhere. I believe you. You don't have pretend to believe me just to calm me down. -You, too? -That night, I wished for... I wanted to remain as my boss's trusted person. But not the same boss. I liked you since we were on the Student Board. You're the best boss. This isn't real, Indra. It's all real. You, me, this apartment, your job. Mr. Tama's feelings for you, all real-- This is not real, Indra. Should this card determine our destiny? And the price for that, I have to lose my family, Indra. I don't know. Maybe you lost something, too, that I don't know. We have to find Madam Sri Menyan at any cost. -We have to go back. -Back to my failed life? -To my old boss? Miss Diana was cruel. -I am too, Indra. You saw it, right? I've become cruel. Now I can feel what Diana feels like. When we can't get what we want and we're never satisfied with what we get, we tend to hurt other people around us. Thank you, Indra. Tomorrow, we'll go around Jakarta. We'll look for Madam Sri Menyan. Let me check our schedules. What is that? Invitation for the high school reunion. You're invited, aren't you? REUNION COSTUME PARTY Miss Diana is the chairman. Oh, my God. Now I know. It means that the life we are living right now is before the high school reunion. Before we met Madam Sri Menyan and changed our destinies. No wonder we can't find her. It means returning to the starting point. The point where I first met Madam Sri Menyan at the high school reunion. "Before the day changes, return to the starting point. Afterwards, it will not return." It means we have to make a wish before it's past midnight. If not, we will not be able to return to our past lives. We'll be stuck in this life. We must go there. -I'm ready, Indra. -Okay, miss. -Drink this, so you feel fresh. -Thank you. Come, let's go. -My head is spinning. -Are you okay? Miss Kirana. Are you okay? Miss. Miss. Miss. Miss. I'm sorry, miss. I don't want to go back. I want it to be like this forever. I take one, please. -You came alone, Indra? -Yes, miss. -Kirana didn't come? -No. -Thank you. -Thank you. Did you invite Miss Kirana? What for? Kirana never likes it. She never comes to the reunion, right? Excuse me, Indra. -Hi, Mommy. -Hi. -Get a wife. -How are you? -Hello. -Always intimate... Miss. Miss Kirana. Miss. Inge? Indra asked me to take you to the reunion party. Indra? He regretted it. He's sorry. He felt guilty, Miss Kirana. Let's go. We can still make it. Please, Ma'am. Don't close it yet. Your mouth should be closed. "Ma'am"? You knucklehead. It's Madam. I'm sorry, Madam. -Don't close it yet. -The reunion's over, why should I stay? There's one person who wants to meet Madam. It's important. -She's on the way. -Indra! There she is. I'm sorry for... It's okay, Indra. I'm here now. Do you want to go back to your life that's full of regrets? No, I promise I will never regret it again. I love my family and I want to go back. Come inside. Pick a card. What is your biggest regret in life? I'm sorry for not being grateful for my past life. Pick the second card. What is your deepest desire? If I was still with my family... I would take care of them better. I love them. Open the third card. It's blank? There's someone who wanted your life. Ask her to give it back to you, too. The one who wanted your life, you and her should swap places. Diana? Come, Indra. Let's go. Thank you, Papi, for accompanying me to the reunion tonight. You're welcome, Mommy. -I love you, Papi. -I love you, too, Mommy. I'm sorry, Mr. Ben. My friends need advice to buy a car. If you have the time... Wait a minute, Mommy. Who is it? Some of my friends. I'm sorry to bother you. -In a minute, please? Where? Okay. -There. REUNION - ANGKASA HIGH SCHOOL CLASS OF 2000-2002 -Kirana. -Tama? I'm sorry, I'm in a rush. Kirana, I've been looking for you everywhere. Sorry, there's something important I need to do.. Kirana, this is also more important. Will you marry me? Tama... Tama, get up. -We can't be together, Tama. -Why? There must be a woman who is more appropriate for you. I am sorry. That was a rehearsal. A rehearsal. Wait for the right day. Rehearsal. -Kirana? -Diana, I want my life back. No way. The reunion is over. Madam Sri Menyan has already left. No, Madam Sri Menyan is waiting for us at the back. I don't want to go back. You want to take my life? You're the one who wanted mine in the first place! -Yes, but I don't want to lose my family! -Neither do I! Diana! Stop, Diana. Are you crazy? No. I don't want to go back to my past life! They're my family! Regga and Windy are my flesh and blood! They love me, too! I'm a better mother than you! I raised them! I took care of them! You don't have those memories, Diana! It's because it never happened in your life before! It's the same with me. I don't know the process of building a PR consultant company! Because it really never happened to me! How can we be proud of what we've accomplished if we have never experienced the process? -Stop it, Diana! We could die! -I'd rather die than go back to my past. You're not a good mother, Diana. You don't love Regga and Windy. You'd rather we both die than you go back to your past life? You don't think about how Regga and Windy would feel if they lost their mother? I know it now. You didn't do this for them. -You're still in love with Ben! -Because you took Ben from me! I never did that. Ben was never in love with you! It's your-- Yes? What? Windy? Okay, I'm coming home now. What happened to Windy? -Windy is suffocating. -Get in the car. Hurry. Miss Windy. Oh, my God. Miss. Windy? Windy? Windy. -Are you okay, Windy? What happened? -I don't know, ma'am. Windy. She had a biscuit with peanuts. She is allergic to peanuts. Why did you give it to her? -It wasn't me, ma'am. -Okay. Go to the refrigerator. Please take the blue bag under the eggs in the chiller. Go get it! Hurry! Be patient, dear. Don't give her a pillow. Let her lay on the bed. Windy, hang on, honey. Windy? Kirana. Windy? -Get up, Windy. -Windy, Na. -Windy! -Get up. One, two, three. -Windy, Mommy loves you. -Mommy! -Mommy. -Honey, this is Mommy. Here, ma'am. -What is that, Na? -It's her allergy medication. Hold it, dear. Just a little pinch. It's done, dear. It's okay. You will breathe better later. Just lay for a while without a pillow. I'm sorry, Mom. I'm the one who gave Windy those cookies. Why did you give it to her? It had peanuts in it! I can't read, Mom. How could you not read? Do you want to hurt your sister? Diana. I told you Regga is dyslexic. Na... That time about Regga's reports... I lied. His grades were dropping. Please, give Regga confidence. Don't let his weakness destroy his future. Please take care of the children, Di. Kirana. I'm going with you to meet Madam Sri Menyan. You are right. I will never take your place. Too late. It's already past midnight. Did you forget Ben's habit? All the clocks in this house are 30 minutes ahead. Oh, my God. You're right. Let's go, come. -Five minutes left. -Patient. They won't make it. Are we still friends after this, Na? Okay. Stop right here. We still have time. Come on. They'll come, wait for them. Here they are. -Are you ready? -Hold it. I'm sorry, Indra. -Okay, miss. Let's go. -Please, come in. Pick a card. Take out your cards. You are ready. I'm afraid, Na. They hate me. All the staff love you, Di. Especially Indra. He's a good assistant. Na... Morning, Mommy. Mommy? You said you want me to be romantic? Just Kir. It's romantic. -It smells bad. -Really? Sorry. I missed you. Me or my fart? It's not like you, Kir. Windy, Regga. Mama loves you. -Windy loves Mama, too. -Me, too. Good morning. Everybody is awake. I'm sorry for being too hard on you. It's nothing. Let's shower, you'll be late. -Me first! -Me! Happy birthday! Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you -Happy birthday, miss. -Thank you, Inge. By the way, Indra has had a crush on you for a long time. -You like Indra, too, right? -Yeah. Can I have the cake? Happy birthday. Speechless? Is it because I didn't bring you a gift. I just need one gift. Ask me for dinner once more. I promise I won't say no. Tina Cempaka, will you marry me? What did I say? Wait for the right day. This is the day. So, Diana and Bram are next, right? No. I gave the opportunity to the younger ones. Indra and Inge first. -Right, Indra? -Amen. I agree. We will continue later, okay? Bye. -Bye. -Bye. -Mama. Join us, come on. -Okay. Let us take a picture. Come on, Ben. Take the picture. Come on. One, two, three. Three, one. Action! It doesn't work. Stupid! Help me, please! Action! Just take me home, Tama. Pick it up. -Don't you never-- -Never. Don't you never. Take your hands off me! I'll burn this house! By the way... You once said that creating an image means creating an illusion. It's not match to reality. -So? -Why is it... Hold on a second! I'm in a hurry. -Who are we? -Screaming Queens! -Say what? -Screaming Queens! This is bad. I forgot this line. I'm sorry. -This one! -Donald Duck character! -Take our picture! -What are you doing? Take one! Will you marry me? Yes! I'm sorry. What should I do first? Take one! Action! The shutter is closed! One more time! I'm so tense, Indra. Why am I laughing? I'm tense, too! What should I say? I forgot! I should've told... What's the line? Bang! Bang! Wow! Disco! You're single! Enjoy! Oh, my God. I forgot! Wait a sec. I've to go to the toilet. But, Kirana, may I have your card? Kirana?
