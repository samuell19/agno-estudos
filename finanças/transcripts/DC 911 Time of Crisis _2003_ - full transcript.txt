[jet engine roaring] >> Goodness gracious. [chuckles] Must be something here I'm just not communicating. >> No, Mr. Secretary. We understand how much you want to revamp the Department of Defense. You've made that very clear. I guess we're not communicating our problem. Lack of available funds. Both political parties are committed to a Social Security lockbox. >> Well, Social Security is a wonderful thing, Congressman, but without national security, it won't be much use. >> That's, uh-- That's pretty dramatic. >> No doubt. But be clear, gentlemen. We've got North Koreans launching missiles. We had an attack on the World Trade Center in 1993. Then the USS Cole, the East African Embassy bombings, the Khobar Towers. There's a war going on out there. Now, it's in slow motion, but it's real. And there's no reason to believe that the people responsible for these events have decided to take up new careers. There's bound to be more. >> More? Can you be specific? >> [chuckling] Not at this moment. But mark my words, there'll be something. Yeah. An event. And we-- you and I-- don't want to be on the wrong side of that event. Our military must be transformed, made ready for this new world, or we'll be very much on the wrong side, Social Security lockbox or not. >> ♪ Ooh, ooh, ooh... ♪ Ooh... ooh... ooh... ♪♪ [children laughing and chattering] >> Thing is, you don't pronounce that "E," but there's a reason it's there. So, Cindy, can you say that word? [pager buzzing] >> Game. >> No, so everyone can hear it. >> Game. >> Yeah, see? [chuckling] Bunch of good readers here, huh? >> Yeah. >> A second plane has hit the second tower. America is under attack. >> Say that word for me? >> Game. >> Guess you know why that E's at the end of that word. It all begins with reading. I think you've all done a terrific job. >> Mr. President, are you aware-- >> We're gonna talk about that later. Thank you very much. >> Thank you. [reporters chattering] >> I would imagine, uh, what we just saw was a twin engine-- It appeared to be a twin-engine jetliner. >> This is clearly deliberate. >> A chilling, chilling horrible scene that we just saw. ...the World Trade Center the very soul and the very heart of our nation, Joe. >> A twin-engine jet... >> Al Qaeda? >> Is it true? >> ...people work in these buildings each and every day. It happened right at 9:00 A.M. A good number of those folks were already at their desks. [chatter] ...the plane slamming into the second building. Look at it. It's coming in from the side, coming low, hitting the building about in the middle. Folks, uh, you see the pictures. It looks like Hollywood, but this is real. [sirens wailing] >> Roger that. That's been confirmed, ma'am. Both towers. We understand Senator Kennedy is standing by. >> Well, the hearing will of course be postponed. We can testify about education initiatives another day. But we'll continue on to the Hill. >> Postponement notwithstanding? >> Absolutely. This is a day to stay orderly. We'll appear with Senator Kennedy and... and explain to the press. It'll be good to see him on a day like this. He knows so much about... national loss. >> Mr. President. >> ...of the police and the fire department and the emergency technicians are headed to... >> Rummy? >> Yes, Mr. President? >> Hike alert status-- Delta. >> That's military, CIA, foreign, domestic, everything. And if you haven't gone to DEFCON 3, you ought to. >> Done. But there's still 6,000 civilian aircraft in the air. >> Norm Mineta will ground 'em. In the meantime, I want you to get your boys up there. We'll pass on the word. [chatter] >> As you can see, this is a story of enor-- of enormous magnitude. [phone rings] >> Vice? >> Your current, Mr. President. >> We are at war. Is the Counterterrorism Task Force up and running? >> Yes, and we're checking all flights in progress. >> Mineta's gonna ground the whole civil aviation fleet. >> In the works. >> Okay, you just keep Rummy up to speed on that. You let me know how that order progresses. I want you to brief congressional leadership. I'm gonna make a statement, and then I will call you from Air Force One. >> Is Karen with you? >> Nah. She stayed home. Last night was her wedding anniversary. >> There's a makeshift studio setting up next door. >> You ready? You up to speed? >> Those are two separate things, Andy. I know we're at war, but face it, we are in a scramble mode. [chatter] Ladies and gentlemen, this is a... difficult moment for America. Today we've had... a national tragedy. Two airplanes have crashed into the World Trade Center in an apparent terrorist attack on our country. Now, we're gonna hunt down and find those folks who committed this act. Terrorism against our nation will not stand. Now if you'll all join me in a moment of silence. May God bless the victims, their families, and America. Thank you very much. >> Yes, Annie. Yes. No, no, I must speak with him. [loud explosion, rumbling] [horns honking, sirens wailing] [indistinct shouting] [siren blaring] [explosion] [woman shrieks] [siren wails] >> Come on! >> I'm really sorry, Miss Hughes, but we can't establish contact with Air Force One. >> Thank you. >> ...a blast, an explosion. We looked up... >> [sighs] Madness. The world's gone mad. >> Sir, you need to see this. >> Hawkeye Two and Hawkeye Three, assume escort positions on Angel. Hawkeye One. >> Okay, wilco. >> Hawkeye Three, wilco. >> Hey. They got our backs. >> ...flying the plane that crashed on the other side of the Pentagon... >> All right, we're at war. That much we know. >> ...just, uh, west of the Pentagon, one eyewitness claiming that he saw a U.S. Air 737... >> Whoever did this isn't gonna like me as president. They're gonna pay for this. >> Vice President, line three, sir. >> Hey, Vice. >> There have been threats against nuclear plants, a reported car bomb at the Lincoln Memorial, stories coming in of snipers all across the country. >> All-out war? >> They're evacuating the Capitol and the Supreme Court. >> You hold down the fort, Vice. We're on our way. Get full security on Laura and my girls. >> Right. >> I need Mueller. He's only had six days on the job, but the rubber's hit the road. And I need Condi to... >> Mr. President, we've received a threat against this aircraft. >> Air Force One? A credible threat? >> Very much credible, sir. They used today's code word. The Angel is next. >> Coordinate with Governor Pataki because the National Guard is-- >> Sorry, Mr. Vice President. We've had three threats on the White House. >> To be expected. >> Supported by a credible threat on Air Force One. >> How credible? >> They had today's code name. Angel. [phone rings] >> And just overhead a moment ago, something I have never... >> Yes, Mr. President. >> Condi, we have gone to DEFCON Delta. I don't want that misunderstood. >> I've already spoken with President Putin. He understands. All he needs to know is that-- >> Miss Rice. >> He'll stand his forces down. I'll confirm when it's done. Right now, I believe we are evacuating. >> Need to go now, please. Outside as quickly as possible. >> Where are we going? >> Downstairs, sir. >> Where downstairs? >> Very downstairs, sir. [sirens wailing] >> No! [woman shrieks] >> Oh, my God! [shouting and screaming] >> [coughing and gasping] >> We're continuing on to Washington. This is a war. People can't have an AWOL president. >> But, sir, the Pentagon's been hit. There are still three planes unaccounted for. The White House is not a secure location. >> Camp David. We'll take this down at Andrews. >> Mr. President, reports of a rogue aircraft hitting Camp David. >> John, thank you. We are awaiting to hear when the president will land and exactly where and when he might have something to say about all of this. >> You're breaking up. Hello? Hello? >> Trying to reach Danielle? >> Yeah, no connection. She's dropping the kids off at school. >> Schools ought to be safe. >> This is a Jewish day school. >> Normal pace. No panic. >> I can't hear you. You're breaking up. >> Mineta gave the order. The entire civil aviation fleet should be on the ground by now. He's on his way. So is the entire emergency group. >> Then, let's get to work. [siren wailing] >> It doesn't matter what's on the schedule. The annual Congressional barbecue is not gonna happen on the lawn today! >> You'll have to evacuate the premises, Mr. Henick. We're emptying the building. Try to remain calm. An orderly exit is best for everyone. [sirens blaring] >> No panic. IDs in plain view. >> Run! Run! Hide your IDs! You may be under attack! Hide your IDs! You may be sniper targets. Let's go! Move it! Everybody, move it! >> Drive on. >> Clear skies ahead. >> Intel says six planes still unaccounted for. Stories of a fire in the White House, unconfirmed because it's evacuated. >> They're reporting rumors of a hit on the Supreme Court. >> Sounds like an attempted decapitation. Cut the head off the government. But vice and staff are in the PEOC, where no one's gonna get them, and any further silence from me, whoever's behind this is gonna think they've succeeded, to say nothing of the rest of the world. >> All the more reason to keep-- >> All the more reason-- get me home! >> The security shield isn't up around Andrews yet. >> Well, then, get me to the closest place I can speak to the nation. The American people want to know where their dang president is! >> ...Colombia, where, of course, terrorism is a constant threat. Uh, we are, uh-- we're waiting, as we noted, for further word from the White House, uh, where communications are obviously a problem because everybody's been evacuated-- >> You can bet they do. >> ...where and when the president will land. >> Barksdale AFB is secure, sir. But with the reporters and everything-- >> Ari can secure the Press Corps. >> Unidentified aircraft over south-central Pennsylvania. Not responding. 18 minutes out and closing. Request rules of engagement, sir. >> The president ordered the fleet be grounded. Issue another warning. If still ignored, assume a hostile. Engage and bring to ground. [beeping] >> 12 minutes out and closing. Civilian aircraft. Do we engage, sir? >> If unresponsive, take it down. [rapid beeping] >> Eight minutes out and closing. Rule of engagement still stands, sir? >> Of course it does! [steady beep] >> It's gone, sir. >> Back to work, please. >> Did we shoot it down? >> Apparently not. Some internal failure. >> We'll find out in time. We're gonna kick the hell out of whoever did this. No slap-on-the-wrist game this time. >> Ten-hut! >> How the hell did it ever come to this? [indistinct shouting] >> Let's go! Let's go! >> We are safe and sound at Barksdale. Look, I need to speak to the American people. >> There's no capacity for civilian transmission from that AFB, Mr. President. >> It has been hours since they've heard from me. We got the TV showing 'em we've been bombed and blasted. We dang well better show 'em this government is not in chaos and that we are functioning smoothly and that we're gonna get the bastards. How long has it been, Ari? >> Since you spoke in Florida, almost three and half hours ago. >> Can you set up a video feed? >> Yes. We'll transmit the signal over secure military lines. >> The plane that went down in Pennsylvania, you said it wasn't us-- internal failure. Anything more specific? >> No, sir. From what's coming in, some passengers on cell phones figured out what was happening, and they took matters into their own hands. >> [sighs] God bless their souls. God bless 'em. [sirens blaring, helicopter rotors whirring] Freedom itself was attacked this morning by a faceless coward, and freedom will be defended. I want to reassure the American people that full-- the full resources of the federal government are working to assist local authorities to save lives and to help the victims of these attacks. We have taken all appropri-- appropriate security precautions to protect the American people. Make no mistake. The United States will hunt down and punish those responsible for these cowardly acts. We've been in touch with the leaders of Congress and with world leaders to assure them that we will do whatever is necessary to-- >> You need to read that, ma'am. >> ...and Americans. >> It's a message from the downed plane. >> I ask the American people to join me in saying a thanks to all the folks who have been fighting hard... >> Get me the FBI. >> The resolve of our great nation is being tested. But make no mistake. We will show the world that we will pass this test. God bless. >> Yes. All right. [chatter, phones ringing] >> Flight Attendant on American Flight 11, Amy Sweeney, Mr. President. She had the presence of mind to call her head office with the seat assignments of the hijackers before... FBI identified them as follows. >> What is the degree of doubt? >> Not much. This is a very sophisticated operation. That made us suspect Al Qaeda to begin with. With these positive identifications, we now have to use that as the working assumption. >> You have to be sure before you tell the world. Meantime, I'm coming home. >> The Secret Service advises against that, and frankly, Mr. President... so do I. >> We have the threat against Angel by name. We have an almost positive fix on the enemy, and that's-- that's one that we have to take very seriously. >> We haven't diverted all the international flights. Not all the rumored bomb threats and sniper reports in the DC area are clear. >> The bigger the enemy, the greater the victory if they can keep me here and not there. Where is Laura? >> Safe with us, sir. >> Well, then, I can be as well. >> It's still unsteady back here, sir. Very unsteady. Angel is safe. We should listen to the pros on this. You know we should. >> They're on our side, Mr. President. >> Offutt? >> Yeah. >> At least take the safe route home. Stop at Offutt 'til we know that Washington's secure. >> All right. For now. >> Yes, sir. >> Could you get me Laura? >> Mayor, what's the situation right now? >> The situation is that two airplanes have attacked apparently... >> Got ahold of Giuliani's office yet? >> Coming. >> All right, well, then, let's get-- let's get-- let's go north, then. [TV mutes] >> All right, say it is Al Qaeda. Saying we're going after 'em could be an empty promise. But they're mosquitoes. You got to get the swamps they live in. >> Do we know where all those swamps are? >> Excuse me. Uh, Mr. President, the press is desperate for photographs. >> Yeah, whatever. Yeah. Well, I got to get back to Washington because I'm not gonna let those people keep me from getting home. >> What if the lull is deliberate, waiting exactly for your return? >> Sir, Pataki and Giuliani. >> Hi, George. Hello, Rudy. Listen, I know-- I know your hearts are breaking. Your city is... oh, it's stinging, but, uh... if there's anything we can do to help, you just say the word. And, guys, I've seen you both on TV, and you are handling things, I mean, really, really well. Just be wary. Our intel people say you can expect a second strike. [camera shutter clicking] Our thoughts are with you. Our prayers. You just-- You hang in there. >> Come on. >> [sniffles] All I can offer-- a few words. Well, the sooner I get home... [sighs] Oh, God. God, I need Karen. >> We have two themes, Karen. People need to be reassured. They also need to know this won't go unanswered. Just work a draft. >> All right. >> We'll talk as soon as I land at Offutt. Dick? >> Uh, just a minute. Sir. >> Thank you. Mr. President? >> As soon as I land, I want a complete National Security Council meeting. By then, we have to start on some firm answers. >> Yes, sir. >> Uh, I'm gonna speak to the nation from Offutt at 4:00. >> Amy Sweeney's initiative led directly to names of other suspected Al Qaeda operatives on the manifests of all four aircraft. We're at 14 so far and still counting. All Saudis. >> Tourists? Legal residents? What? >> Working up those answers now. >> Well, surely it's not an official Saudi connection. >> Unlikely. One of the hijackers, a Khalid al-Mihdhar, surfaced on our screens in Malaysia last year. >> It would be nice to find one country to pin this on, but as you know, Mr. President, Al Qaeda means "the base." If this is who we're dealing with-- and I'm now ready to use that as the operating assumption-- then we've got a subnational conflict on our hands, a new kind of war. >> One we'll be fighting on our home front. >> Without doubt. And we're way behind them in terms of domestic intelligence. >> Are there any other arrows that point to this bin Laden? >> Our people overseas have been collecting all kinds of chatter among Al Qaeda operatives congratulating each other. They're burning up their cell phones. >> Bob, I know you've only had six days on the job, but what have your folks been getting? >> Can't say yet, Mr. President. We're very constrained when it comes to domestic intelligence. We're sifting through it now. >> Okay, what-- what have they given George's people over at CIA? >> Our computers don't network, Mr. President. >> How long has it been since the last civilian aircraft landed? >> A little more than five hours. >> Tell Karen forget the 4:00 speech from here. I'm coming home. We're gonna talk to the nation from the Oval Office tonight, 9:00 p.m. Eastern. >> But the Secret Service doesn't think it's safe-- >> If some tinhorn terrorist wants me, tell him to come on over and get me, all right? I'll be home. I'll just be waiting for the bastard. >> Mr. President-- >> Try Commander in Chief, whose present command is take the president home. >> We'd better all remember in the weeks, months, and perhaps years to come that we work for the president, the political head of state, but we also take orders from the commander in chief, and his instincts take precedence, when necessary, over our opinions. Now let's get to it. >> ...one of the fatalities on the airplanes. And many other people... >> Oh! >> ...who are suffering tonight, but that of course, uh, you know, is-- is even more dismaying. >> And all of us of course are-- knew Barbara Olson very, very well, and our hearts and our condolences go out to her family and Ted Olson, the solicitor general. A very, very sad day, uh, for the Olsons... >> First Lady from her secure location. >> Are you all right? >> I'm coming home. I'll see you in the White House. >> I spoke with the girls. They're-- They're safe and well. >> Thank God for that blessing. >> We'll be fine. >> We will be fine. I have faith. >> We both do. I love you. >> And I love you. Amen. No. Can't talk about war. Not tonight. There is enough angst and anger on the street. >> But we are gonna have to deal with it. >> If you declare war, you have to be clear who it's on. >> United States will make no distinction amongst those who planned these acts and those who tolerated and encouraged the terrorists. >> Very vague language. What if that includes a sovereign state? >> Preemptive war? >> Well, if that's what it takes, I mean, to prevent another day like this, you're damn right. >> Going after terrorists' allies could mean collateral damage to civilians. >> Well, the farther away we get from today, the less comfortable the American people are gonna be about that. But, uh, no, this declaration is not for tonight. >> That's it, then. >> How much time we got? >> Less than six minutes. >> It's gonna need some tweaking. >> How much? >> A little more reassurance that we stand strong, and the strike-back factor can wait 'til we get our breath back as a nation. "This is more than an act of terrorism. It's an act of war." Strike the war part. Tonight's message is about reassurance. One step at a time. >> Right. >> Think they might want something a little stronger out there? >> Well, we're all still struggling to get back on our feet. How fast we get there is a judgment call. >> 30 seconds, Mr. President. [camera shutters clicking] 15 seconds to air. >> Stand by. Here we go. >> In five, four, three, two... >> Ladies and gentlemen, the president of the United States. >> Today our fellow citizens, our way of life, our very freedom came under attack in a series of deliberate and deadly terrorist attacks. Thousands of lives were suddenly ended by evil, despicable acts of terror. The pictures of airplanes... ...justice and peace. America has stood down enemies before. It will do so this time. [door opens] None of us will forget this day, yet we go forward to defend freedom and all that is good and just in our world. >> Good evening, Mr. President. >> All right, I know we're all tired. I just need a quick rundown before a full Cabinet and full schedule tomorrow. John? >> Still pulling the strands together. But I can tell you now there are real gaps in the I.N.S. The whole visa system. That's where I have to start first thing in the morning. >> Okay, good. But there is one thing I know-- they have figured us out. I mean, they figured out how to get around whatever systems we have in place, so I want you to rethink it, John. All of it. This must never happen to the American people ever again. Never. It is time to start thinking in unconventional ways. And I'll be ready to listen. >> Then, I'll be ready with ideas. >> Norm? >> We're still inventorying the number of aircraft in Canada and Mexico. How many and where. I'll have it by morning. Meantime, all airports remain closed. >> Really happy to see Colin. Had to be a record getting from Peru to DC. >> It was for me. But we were in good hands with Condi while I was incommunicado. >> Your work with President Putin paid off. He stood down and never flinched at the DEFCON Delta. >> Let's just hope he's on board for the long haul. >> I expect so. He's got his own problem with the Muslim Chechens and a huge Muslim population in Central Asia. >> How about the rest of the world? >> Blair is solid. He trusts we're not about to nuke Arabia. But the usual suspects have the usual sniffs of distrust. >> Based on what? >> Based on we're Americans and can do what we want and they're not and can't. And there's the matter of their comfort zone with you personally. >> By usual suspects, you mean the Europeans? >> They're skittish. They have large Muslim populations. >> I'll make the calming calls first thing in the morning. I'm used to that with the Europeans. >> This can be an opportunity for us. We can reach out, especially to the Russians and Chinese, use this to improve our relations with them. They've also got a large Muslim population, reason enough on their own to fear Al Qaeda. We can make common cause. >> How to prosecute that cause, Mr. President? How much evidence will we want before we go after Al Qaeda? >> We're almost there. >> Have we considered cutting off the head? The ruling Taliban was nurtured by Pakistan's Internal Security Agency. Now they are funded and embraced by UBL and his Al Qaeda. Afghanistan is the terrorists' virtual fiefdom. >> Then, we're gonna start there. >> That's easier said than done. It took six months of Desert Shield to enable six days of Desert Storm. If we're after making faster headway, we've got to skip a generation of military thinking, fight in a new way. >> That is exactly the kind of thinking I'm talking about. That is unconventional. All right, Rummy, you want to shake up them generals, huh? Go ahead, push 'em. Ask 'em. Well, why not? >> Yes, sir, yeah. Hard, fast, and soon. >> And that is just a start. Now, we're not just going after terrorists. We're gonna target anyone who pays 'em, supplies 'em, feeds 'em, or harbors them in any way. >> That's new policy, Mr. President. >> Maybe, but there is no other way, and we're not gonna let time slip away. >> We'll have to make it clear to Pakistan and Afghanistan that this is it-- showtime. >> Please do. >> You'll need to declare to the world that this is what we're gonna do. That there's a-- a risk to aiding and abetting our enemies. >> This will take some selling. >> [chuckles] What new policy doesn't? So, we get our ducks in line. >> That means NATO and the U.N. >> The Brits are already preparing an Article V resolution from NATO that'll put them legally and militarily on our side. >> I'll report back on the U.N., but I don't think al Qaeda reads the resolutions. >> All right, how do we tell Al Qaeda we're denying them sanctuary? >> By using every tool of U.S. power. Military, diplomatic, financial, intelligence, cyberscience, legalisms, money, everything. >> We're gonna start there first thing in the morning. Now, look, you know there's a whole lot of people out there, most likely the terrorists included, millions more around the world, a whole bunch right here at home, that think we have gone soft. That all we can do is send a few million-dollar cruise missiles into an empty tent. Some of our own right here at home that think all we can do is, uh, file a few lawsuits as a response. Well, if that was the case, it isn't any longer. And we are gonna have to educate the whole world to that. Hey, I'm not saying it's easy or that I know exactly how to go about that. Not here, not tonight. But I know it is what we have to do, and I intend to tell that to our own people and the world. And together, we're gonna make it stick. Now, I'll be available all night. I will see you and the entire Cabinet at 7:30 first thing in the morning. >> Good night, Mr. President. >> Sir. >> Good night, sir. >> Good night, Mr. President. >> Thank you, sir. >> Mr. President. >> Yeah? >> I believe that you and the First Lady are expected to spend the night in here. >> Expectations... can't always match reality. I'm gonna be upstairs in my own bed. ♪♪ [dog panting] [dog whimpers] [sighs] Come here. Come here, you. >> [chuckling] >> Good night. >> You're exhausted? >> Just beginning to feel it. Pure adrenaline 'til now. I ran three hard miles this morning. Thought I needed to keep an edge on what would be an ordinary day. >> You wanted the job. >> Maybe this is why. >> Mr. President? Incoming aircraft. Possible attack. Come out, sir, now. >> The only planes in the air are our fighter cover! >> Please, sir. Come out now. >> I can't see. My contacts are out. >> You okay? >> Yeah, I'm fine. >> Sorry, Mr. President. It was a friendly. One of our own F-16s. >> Thank God. >> Told you so, huh? Sorry, folks. False alarm. [assemblage murmuring] [exhales sharply] Mr. Prime Minister. >> Mr. President. You received my message? >> Yes. Yes, and I'm more than grateful. Well, all Americans are. We have always been able to depend on you. >> And you can continue to. We're shocked at this horror. You have our total support with any retaliation. >> Yes, we've had a lot of statements of support. Uh, but yours is, uh, actually the first to specify retaliation. Our European allies not too secure with me, are they? What with the Kyoto and ABM Treaty. >> Early days yet. They'll get used to the Texas accent. Have you begun to set a course? >> Strike back hard. >> How? Where? When? >> Well, the when is easy. I want to move yesterday. But I'm not gonna pound sand with million-dollar missiles. So the where and the how are what's holding me back. >> I agree completely. The present choice is between rapid response and effective response. >> Crushing response. There's no flashy or meaningless targets or targets of opportunity. I want to inflict pain, bring enough damage so they understand there's a new team here. A fundamental change in our policy. >> We can work with you on that. I have my own intelligence people gathering all they have to share with you. I'll have our Foreign Office liaise immediately. We're already all over NATO. >> Well, once again, I am more than grateful. [sighs] I mean... here's the thing. This is gonna take a while-- not forever but a while-- to make sure we use this military option in a smart way. But in the meantime, as long as we build an international consensus now, while this outrage is fresh, we will then have a political and a legal basis for the military option when it comes. >> I hear and believe you. They will too. We'll get our staffs on it now, yes? >> Immediately. And thanks, Prime Minister. >> Thank you, Mr. President. Good-bye. [door opens] [footsteps] [door shuts] >> Condi and Tenet are ready. >> So am I. We always knew it might come to this. >> You said that if it did, it's how we'd have to earn our pay. >> And we will. It's a war. It's just a different kind of war. It's gonna need a new playbook. I plan to get that moving at today's Cabinet meeting. Besides that, we'll need a smaller, more compact unit. A war cabinet. >> Roosevelt's was chaired by Stimson. I can chair this exec committee, report to you daily. >> I'll be in the chair. Only the commander in chief can send Americans into harm's way, Dick. No one else. >> Of course. >> [sighs] I'm gonna need you at my side at all times, consigliere. Main thrust, Dick, is to protect the line of succession. I want to be sure that if they get me, you are there and you are ready to step in. Seamlessly. Now, let's do it. We're still scrambling. The order of the day is focus. Focus. This isn't the plane down in China. We have no time. By the end of the day, we must have focus. >> Yes, sir, Mr. President. >> Who's in the crosshair? >> Usama bin Laden. From where I sit, the evidence is conclusive. Human asset on the ground in Kandahar reports that the attacks were, quote, "two years in the planning." Another picked up a strand saying this was, quote, "the beginning of the wrath." >> You know, talking like it's their handwriting doesn't make it so, George. I mean, there's no tolerance for error here. >> Cell phone traffic in several areas confirmed that the attacks were following the doctor's program, obeying his orders. >> We're almost certain that that's Ayman Zawahiri, uh, the Egyptian doctor we identify as UBL's number two. >> And perhaps the real brains behind Al Qaeda. And finally, the designation of zero hour apparently came from Abu Zubaydah. >> Zubaydah. He's the USS Cole planner. >> Exactly. >> CIA and FBI have managed to talk to one another enough to establish, so far, that at least three of the hijackers were trained at Al Qaeda camps in Afghanistan. >> Tell ya, those camps, they cannot be left to fester. What's the status with your contacts with tribal leaders in the south? >> CIA people move in and out regularly. >> Can we intensify our presence there? >> It'll be expensive. >> George, whatever it takes. >> There might be casualties. Mr. President, you have to make the case to the American people. >> There is no need to instruct me on my job, Director. I know my job. Your job, make sure what happened yesterday never happens to the American people ever again. >> Yes, Mr. President. >> Now, can you work me up a plan? Thanks. Uh... I'll need some time with Karen before the Cabinet meeting. Thank you, George. >> Thank you, sir. >> Condi. >> Tom, need your plan for an immediate military response. >> As I said, Mr. Secretary, immediate is what's on the shelf. Sea-launched cruise missiles. >> That sounds like, "You want it bad, you get it bad." >> Sir, it's all we have within 96 hours. >> My goodness, this president isn't about to sling a few missiles at a tent and not follow through. >> What about follow-through, sir? What is the level of political commitment? Like Somalia? Or Beirut? >> Neither. The level just spiked. There's a new game in town. The president wants decisive action, and he wants it fast. In weeks, not months. >> This is not Desert Storm the sequel. >> There'll be a new national mandate by day's end. We'll need a new military doctrine to support it. >> So, the option we're looking at is boots on the ground? >> Whatever it takes to do the job. >> Start with the shelf plan. Add strike aircraft. >> Team up with the anti-Taliban warlords. >> Put Special Forces in there directing the air strikes. >> We remain flexible, keep a small footprint, avoid the Soviet mistakes. >> Excellent. That's the kind of option we're looking for. >> JDAMs, UAVs. >> Exactly. [shouting, jackhammering] >> Let's look at the big picture. A faceless enemy has declared war on us. We're at war. That's what we have to communicate to the American people. It's about educating 'em. There's a war. And that's gonna be the main focus of this administration from now on. >> Yes, sir. >> There's a faceless enemy, runs and hides. Can't hide forever. Thinks its havens are safe. Nah, won't be safe forever. Not the kind of enemy we're used to. But if we educate the American people properly, if we explain it, we do our job right... America will adapt. >> Yes, sir. >> He did the right thing. He took the advice of the Secret Service and went to Offutt Air Force base. >> He hid. He stayed away for hours after all the planes were accounted for. And-- And as for the cock-and-bull story about Air Force One being under threat, give me a break. >> A cock-and-bull story by who? [knocking at door] >> Yeah. >> The military? The Secret Service? >> See the op-ed column? >> The one about the photograph of POTUS on the Air Force One telephone? >> "Is he demanding that his real keeper, Cheney, let him go home?" [chuckling] >> Karl, it's to be expected. >> Is it? >> Most of them get it. The Cheney-runs-the-show myth is always gonna be with some of them. But every day, more and more see what's really going on here. >> Good. >> The Congressional delegation is gathering. >> Sounds ominous, doesn't it? But we got to deal with 'em, so get 'em in the Roosevelt Room, Andy. They're gonna want to know what we know, which is their right, but this whole policy thing, we're not fully there yet. >> This enemy did not attack us because of our policies. >> Mm... So we say. But there's gonna be the chorus of it's our fault, beat up the Israelis, stop using the oil. >> Terrorists don't hate people for what they do. They hate them for what they are. >> Modernity, pluralism, freedom. These are good things, Condi. Liberty is God's gift. It is not negotiable on this watch, and that is the policy. >> Morning, Mr. President. >> Welcome. >> Thank you very much. >> Good to see you, John. >> Great to see you. >> Senator Byrd. >> Mr. President. >> Please be seated. I want to thank you all for coming. Well, I'm glad you're all here. For the obvious reasons and the not-so-obvious ones. It was the enemy's dream for us to be unable to meet here. To see this White House in rubble. And the Capitol. But they failed. So far. >> So far? >> This is not an isolated incident. Our intelligence community is sure of that. And we're gonna have to work together. >> Well, you know you can count on us, Mr. President. >> Well, I'll need ya. We'll need each other. It's gonna be a long struggle. A month from now, Americans will be watching football, World Series, thinking about Thanksgiving, the holidays, but you and I, we will have to continue to wage this war. >> Against whom, Mr. President? >> It's a good question, John, and that's where we begin. As much as anything, we're fighting a frame of mind. >> Though, surely there are things we can do to reach out. >> Well, to ordinary people, sure, but the actual people who did this? No, they hate us. They hate Christianity. They hate Judaism. They hate everything that isn't them. >> Everything? They attacked only us. >> Well, that's because we are the leader of the pack. We protect other nations and have since the advent of the Cold War. Now, you all know that. American people know that. Time has come when many other people and nations are gonna have to choose-- which side are you on? >> Strong rhetoric, Mr. President. War is a powerful word. >> Senator, I can't find the rhetoric powerful enough to contain the way I feel about yesterday's events. Or express the size of the reaction that these people can expect from the American people. >> Well, Mr. President, you can count on full bipartisan support. And I know that we can count on being full partners in this, uh, challenge. >> Oh, yes, you can. Although, I won't be seeking a declaration of war from the Congress. With a shadowy enemy, specificity makes that problematic. But I will be looking for a resolution endorsing the use of force against those who did this and those who helped and harbored them. >> Sir, you may certainly not expect the kind of blank check Lyndon Johnson obtained from us with the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution. No, sir. No more Vietnams. We, sir, still have a Constitution. >> One that I truly revere, Senator Byrd. And I want you to be assured, I will ask nothing from the Congress for which we first haven't made a case to the American people. This will decidedly not be Vietnam. >> Today the president spoke with Prime Minister Blair, with Prime Minister Chrétien, with President Chirac, with Chancellor Schroeder, President Jiang of China, and twice with President Putin. >> Colin, your report... really encouraging. And my own calls uh, to Putin, the Chinese, French, Germans, in the wheelhouse. That is the first part of our job. The second is to move past reassuring the American people and prepare them for what is to come. We want to prepare them without alarming them. The best way to do that is to show them we are on top of this first battle in what may be a long war. Robert? >> [clears throat] Well, we've made real progress in filling out the roster of the hijackers, nailing down their whereabouts. We even know the vehicle they used to get to Logan. >> Good as far as it goes, but what about their support system? >> We're moving as quickly as we can, but deliberately because of the danger of tainting evidence. >> Taint it. The most-- For now, the only important thing is to make sure we stop any planned second strike, stop any accomplices or terrorists before they can hit us again. Or make good their escape and parade through Kabul as heroes. If we can't bring them to trial, so be it. >> Well, that's different. >> The president said to think unconventionally. >> Mission completed. But if you taint the evidence, what'll you do with them? >> Watch them. Keep a tail on them for the rest of their lives, if need be. Remember, in the end, Capone went to jail for tax evasion, not murder. >> We were a different country then. >> And after Tuesday, we're a different country all over again. If we're to make the mission, the Justice Department-- that's FBI, INS, all of it-- has to shift the focus from prosecution to prevention. This is a time to be proactive, not reactive. >> Well, I understand the logic. But it's a radical shift in policy. I'll put it before the Cabinet. In the meantime, you continue on with this preventative plan. All right, while domestic issues are being worked on, uh, we're gonna need some clarity with the big picture. >> We've started on the "for us, against us" message to both Pakistan and the Taliban, in general terms so far, but moving towards a list of demands. >> Taliban need to understand, handing over bin Laden won't do it. All right? I mean, this whole Al Qaeda has to be dismantled, the leaders handed over, the sheep kicked out. Nothing less. Pakistanis, they need to understand their role in this. I am telling you. >> What should I be asking for, precisely? >> Whatever it takes. >> We need to start as we mean to go on. How we define the task going in will lock in other nations when they sign on any coalition. >> Meaning? >> Meaning, for example, we let Saddam Hussein off the hook the last go-round. The Arab Coalition partners said they never signed on to help remove an Arab leader. So our hands were tied. This time, the mission should define the coalition, not the other way around. The mission is the destruction of Al Qaeda. Hussein isn't germane. >> He is if we're talking about terrorism in the broadest sense. We know he never stopped developing weapons of mass destruction, which we know he's used on his own people. >> But has never used outside of Iraq. >> What about Iran? >> Al Qaeda lacks weapons. That's why they used our own aircraft. You put Hussein and bin Laden together... >> Is that an immediate threat? >> The enemy is clearly more than UBL and the Taliban. If we're including people who support terrorists, that does open the door to Iraq, but unlike bin Laden, we know where to find them. >> We start with bin Laden. That is what the American people will expect. Getting him will be a huge blow for our side. So let's build a coalition for that job. Later, we can shape different coalitions for different tasks. I said this is gonna be a long war. Things will change. For our opening campaign, we are going to need a major military assault. >> To start with bin Laden was the right move. Good instincts. >> For the moment, I want a target the average person can understand. Thank you. Please. And with what we know, he's the right starting point. In time-- not long, but in time-- we'll get the bigger idea across. Condi, what did you think of John's idea? >> Sensible but problematic. When national defense and civil liberties come into conflict... >> Yeah. Saturday, we'll hash it out then. Camp David is best. >> I'll see arrangements are made. ♪♪ >> This NATO vote is a big boost to us. We need to know you are there with us. Well, we know you Brits always are, but some of the others-- >> Well, they'll come to see this is different. That NATO's entire history's always been something of a one-way street. This is the first time you've looked to us for help in facing down a hostile threat. >> Everyone's in place in the Situation Room. You ready? >> What, to hear the CIA's solution to the Taliban? You better believe it, Vice. Look, we're two days into this. The scrambling time is over. Today we start making the hard choices. >> We've been deep in the Northern Alliance for some time. They began as a ragtag amalgam of mobs-- five major groupings, perhaps two dozen subsets-- led by local warlords who go back and forth according to the daily market price. The one steadying hand that could pull them all together was Ahmad Shah Massoud. Charismatic, Western-educated, exactly what was needed to whip the Alliance into a potent fighting force. Four days ago, two suicide bombers posing as journalists assassinated him. >> Al Qaeda? >> Almost certainly. But we still have some CIA paramilitary teams operating in-country. If we increased those so there was, let's say, one with each warlord backed with enough money to keep them loyal, we can lay the basis for a wider action. >> These teams, they'd have to transform into army special forces and rangers if they're to link to conventional military. >> If you mean the boots on the ground that use lasers to guide ship-launched missiles, aircraft, Air Force AWACS, of course. But those elements will take time to deploy. These teams are ready to go. >> Cofer Black, Mr. President. I run these teams. They can bring home the bacon. And the guy who looks after the pigs with it. >> [chuckling] >> But make no mistake, Mr. President. Doing it means people will die. Americans will die. My friends and colleagues. But... give our teams the mission, and we'll take these guys out. And I mean out. We'll drop a team in here and here and here and here until we're as tight as a tortoise to his shell with every local leader in the north. That gives them and their fighters confidence. With the Afghans, you have to be the winning side, or you're a non-starter. Then a little cash to keep it all lubricated. Now we have a cohesive force for the soldiers who'll come in behind us. We use that force to hit the caves. Hit, hit, hit! Because that's where these A-Q types live, like worms in the ground. Oh, yeah, we'll smoke 'em out. We'll flush the bastards into the open air. And that's bonus time for us, sir. Because our local allies have all kinds of scores to settle. By the time they're through the accounting, we won't have a whole lot to clean up, and then it's on to the next set of caves. It won't be bloodless. But give us the mission, and we'll get 'em. Within a matter of weeks, we'll have it set up so the military will face a one-sided rout. The enemy will have flies on their eyeballs. >> You did say unconventional. >> Well, Joe Hagen and I have juggled it back and forth, made allowances for all the policy and political issues. It comes down to Monday. >> Five days off. The media will howl he's ducking it, but work here comes first. >> Karen's for televising today's phone call to Pataki and Giuliani, show he's intent on outreach. >> The only other day would be Friday. >> Friday's a national day of remembrance. He's delivering the homily. To then fly to New York, it's a lot to ask for one day. >> Under the best of circumstances, New York makes me very uneasy. >> Well, you're gonna be on the ground way ahead of the game. The National Guard's already in place, and the president's gonna stay behind police barricades. See, the president is gonna approach Ground Zero this way. You got fire and police personnel lining the street, media at a discreet distance. Then to the site, always staying behind your lines, Chief. Then he gets back in the limo, drives up the West Side Highway with Rudy and Governor Pataki, where he meets with the grieving families. >> Crowd control at Ground Zero, it's still spotty. >> It's not that. It's about emotional exposure. Think about it. Since this happened, a wall's come down around him. The president becomes a nation, doesn't he? And we wrap him up in a cocoon. I mean hell, Chief, your boys didn't even want him to come back here to the office. You wanted to keep him all cuddled up at Offutt. So, he became Commander-in-Chief, took back control of his destiny, and since then, he's been pushing, prodding, listening, studying, and slowly we regrouped, and the fog started to lift, and that's good. It's good for us, good for America. And now this. >> I don't get it. What am I missing? >> On Friday, we lift the wall, take the defenses away, and send him to the pulpit of the church. Then on Monday, to the raw emotions of rescue workers and grievers. Forget about the emotional stress of discussing policy. Now comfort tears and pain as an ordinary man. And this is a man who feels very deeply. He's got a whole load of emotion of his own. >> Okay, here's what's gonna happen. The president's gonna arrive when the phone connection is up. When the call is concluded, we leave. No questions. >> George. Rudy. Listen, you all are doing an amazing job, and uh... you know our prayers are with you. >> He's fighting his emotion. What happens when we take him there? >> We got a few days 'til then. He'll be fine by Monday. >> On Friday, after the national remembrance service, I'm gonna come out there and visit ya. >> When he's done, you get the press out. >> I wish I could visit under better circumstances, but, uh, at least this'll give the three of us a chance to, you know, hug and cry with the fine people of your good area. [clears throat] >> Mr. President. >> Yeah? >> Could you tell us what you're thinking? Your prayers, where your heart is? >> I'm not thinking about myself... not at this moment. I'm thinking of all those people, the families... all those children. Hey, look, you know I'm a loving guy. But I also am someone with a job to do, and I intend to do it. And this is a terrible moment. But this country will not relent until it has saved itself and others from this terrible tragedy that came upon us. >> Okay, that's it, everyone. Thank you. >> Just have one more question. [quiet chatter] >> That put the awful office speech of 9/11 behind us, and that is the man the nation needs to see and understand at the remembrance service. So, it's full-out on that until it's done. >> I'm still at the reaction part. This was begun at a time of others' choosing but will end in a way and an hour of ours. Clumsy, and I am polishing. >> It's good. But you can't get there without going through the grief process first. How's that? >> Really good. >> Good. Thanks. >> We can't take on the Taliban without help from Pakistan. >> Let's make a wish list. Everything we ever wanted from Mr. Musharraf. >> First, stop all Al Qaeda agents and personnel at the border and stop all arms and logistic shipments through Pakistan. No help or aid of any kind to bin Laden via Pakistan. >> Or by air drop. We'll need to police that. So, second, full overflight and landing rights. >> But the region is still beyond our reach for now. So, third, access to the military, air, and naval installations. That bottles them up. But we still need to smoke out as many as we can. So, Pakistan has to cut off all fuel shipments to the Taliban. >> And stop the flow of volunteers. No more allowed to cross the frontier. >> Ah, tough to police. Unless we have access to their intelligence. >> Access to intelligence. >> Good. Closes Al Qaeda in, quarantines the Taliban, and makes serious moves toward starving them out. But this cannot be our little secret. The world has to know where he stands. The president has said, "With us or against us." So, point six, publicly condemn the 9/11 attacks and suppress any internal shows of support for those who inflicted them. And seven, if bin Laden is shown to be implicated in these attacks and the Taliban refuses to hand him over and dismantle Al Qaeda, then Pakistan will break all diplomatic relations with Afghanistan and join in the effort to unseat its government. >> His own people put that government in place. You're asking a hell of a lot. >> Nothing ventured... In any event, we need to put the questions and have Musharraf's answers by Saturday's meeting at Camp David. >> Okay. >> The president today has made a series of phone calls to world leaders. He has spoken with Prime Minister Koizumi of Japan, Prime Minister Berlusconi of Italy, Lord Robertson of NATO, Crown Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia, and President Mubarak of Egypt. This afternoon he will visit a local hospital, and later he will meet with members of Congress from the Virginia area to talk about the ongoing efforts of the federal government to be of assistance to the families and victims. >> How you doing? >> Fine, sir. >> How are you? >> Thank you for coming. >> Do you have everything you need? You hang in there, huh? >> [sobbing] ♪♪ >> How are you, dear? What can we do to help? >> I'm just so grateful you're here. >> We wouldn't be anywhere else. >> I crawled through the flames. >> Now you're gonna walk right back through that front door. >> You will take care of us? >> You count on it. [siren wailing] >> Look, as long as he stays behind NYPD lines, you guys got nothing to worry about, okay? No, no, no, no, no, I don't need visible National Guardsmen. Yes, you can have NYPD and FDNY lining the streets as he approaches the tents, okay? Excuse me. I want DOBs and Social Security numbers on all the family members that are gonna be at the Javits Center, all right? >> For God's sakes, we're running out of time. You got to get a hold of this thing. >> Well, I'm trying to, but he made the decision. He didn't ask my permission first, and he is the boss. >> Look, this is not just about capturing a few people and holding them accountable. It's also about removing sanctuaries, support systems. >> Do I hear Iraq? >> The hawks will always be with us. More preparation for Saturday. >> This is a campaign and not a single action. We have to keep after these people and those who support them until it stops. [chatter] >> Sir! We have questions, Mr. President. >> There's been a threat on the White House, and we're taking it seriously. >> Well, this isn't the place to tell me, Andy. Not where the press can see. >> Sir, we need to evacuate you to the PEOC. >> [sighs] And alarm the whole country? I'm staying here. >> Mr. President-- >> I'm hungry. I could splurge on a hamburger about now. >> Well, if you're gonna splurge, you might as well make it a cheeseburger. >> Dick. I may not want to leave... but you have to. We can't allow the possibility of a decapitation. Karen, let all non-essential personnel leave early, and make sure Laura's safe. >> Yes, sir. >> And then we're staying on. >> ...outside Buckingham Palace. Prince Andrew, second son of Queen Elizabeth II, and the U.S. ambassador William Farish attended the ceremony. ["The Star-Spangled Banner" playing] The military band played the U.S. national anthem in honor of the victims of the terrorist attacks. >> One result of Tuesday's tragedy is, as we've been talking about here, that patriotism in this country has surged in the face of an attack on our way of life and the liberties we hold dear. Americans have made it known their allegiance will not waver. >> ♪ And crown thy good ♪ With brotherhood ♪ From sea to shining sea >> I think I should share the secretary of state's thoughts with you. "Dear Mr. President, please don't break down." [laughter] It is good advice. I think I got it all out of my system. >> Good. On a day like today, you'll need to. You got all the emotional words out of your cathedral address? >> Every one. Thanks. I believe Secretary Rumsfeld has prepared a short prayer to begin the meeting. >> Lord, we pray now for Thy guidance, that Thy will be our will, and that we have the strength and patience to measure our lust for action. Amen. >> Amen. >> Amen. >> I want to assure you all that the War Cabinet is making great strides. We are past the scrambling, and we're formulating a strong and steady plan of action, a plan we will soon be able to share with the full Cabinet. But for now, let's just go around the table and see where the broader government is. Transport? >> Civil aviation fleet slowly coming back. We're 16% up and rising but need to discuss new safety protocols. >> Beyond today's service, the president wants, and must, address the nation. When and where? >> And precisely what? >> Content's still ongoing. Changes daily, hourly. For now, let's just stick with the when and where. >> Not the Oval Office. We don't want a repeat of the 9/11 Awful Office speech. >> We're way past that first night. Besides, we're not looking for a cocoon. This needs to be something that the people can connect to very directly. >> The War College is a great venue. Provides an audience, offers an atmosphere of strength. >> It has to be to a joint session of Congress. It's their right. It's the country's right. It's politically right. Our man is always best in front of a big audience. That's the way the nation needs to see him. At his best. >> No, Prime Minister, I understand how difficult it is for you to sit on your hands. But this business can have only one outcome. The end of terrorism. For us and for you. >> What you ask, Mr. President, is reasonable. But we don't deal with reasonable people in this neighborhood. >> Which is why we have to clean it up. And your restraint, even in the face of renewed attacks inside Israel, will help us in that goal. >> We have no greater friend. So, for as long as we can and as much as we can, we will hold our hand. But the world press, they fret over the so-called Arab street. Mr. President, I also have political realities. A people under attack daily. But for as long as we can. >> I can't ask for any more than that. >> Shalom, Mr. President. >> You all right? >> Yeah. Today the president has to be the country. Permanence, continuity. No room for W today. Today has to be the turning point, or it'll be a terrible setback to the whole healing process. Besides, you did such an amazing job pulling this whole thing together in 36 hours. I better not let you down. [choir singing indistinctly, church bells tolling] We are here in the middle hour of our grief. So many have suffered so great a loss. >> [sobs] >> And today we express our nation's sorrow. We come before God to pray for the missing and the dead and those who loved them. >> [sobbing] >> On Tuesday, this country was attacked with deliberate and massive cruelty. We have seen the images of fire and ashes, and now come the names, the list of the casualties we are only beginning to read. They are the names of men and women who began their day at a desk or in an airport, busy with life. They are the names of people who faced death and who, in their final moments, called home to say "Be brave" and "I love you." Just three days removed from these events, Americans do not have the distance of history, but our responsibility to history is very clear. To answer these attacks and rid the world of evil. War has been brought against us by stealth and deceit and murder. This nation is peaceful but fierce when stirred to anger. This conflict was begun on the timing and terms of others. It will end in a way and at an hour of our choosing.

So when your dad comes back... he'll know you met me. >> Thank you, sir. >> You're welcome. >> Update the Secret Service. You tell 'em we're gonna be here a lot longer than the scheduled half hour. >> Missing a husband? >> No. Son. >> And he's missing? >> No, lost. One of the first pulled out. >> Sorry. >> I already knew. I called the precinct. They said he hadn't been in for roll call. They told me to check back in an hour, but I said, "No need." If he hadn't called in, I knew where he was. Mr. President. >> Yeah? >> I would like to present you with his shield. I want you to have it. He'd want you to have it. To honor all the men and women who lost their lives down there. >> Thank you. >> The president woke at his usual early hour. He walked Barney and Spot at about 5:30 AM. He went for a run. He then had intelligence briefings and security briefings. He also called Presidents Aznar of Spain and Fox of Mexico. He later recorded his radio address. >> One more mile, Mike. Come on, son. Morning, Cool Breeze. >> Morning, Mr. President. >> Is today the point of no return? >> No. Nothing impulsive. Now, there's gonna be a couple hundred years of experience sitting around that table. Let 'em make their presentations, debate it out, while we listen. I'm partial to the flies-on-the-eyeballs guy's solution myself, but we got to listen because that may be all sizzle, no steak. >> Wise. We still have a little time before doing anything final. >> We have to take the time we need, we're not gonna analyze it to death, but we are gonna define the problems and find the best solution. We've accomplished part one in a very short time. Let's not trip up on part two. Besides, nothing's gonna happen 'til the American people know what's in store. [chatter] And these guys are the best messengers for that. >> Then, what can you tell us about the current state of play in Afghanistan and the terrorists' possible global reach? Do we have specific intelligence of activities elsewhere in the Mideast? >> This is an administration that will not talk about how we gather intelligence, how we know what we're gonna do, nor what our plans are. And when we move, we will communicate with you in an appropriate manner. We're at war. >> My news is encouraging. The coalition building goes well. We presented our seven points to Pakistan. Pretty harsh stuff. Draconian perhaps. They were accepted without exception. Musharraf is fully on board the program. >> Well done. That was no easy task, I know. >> Thank you, Mr. President. As you know, NATO is fully aboard, having invoked Article V on our behalf for the first time. The Brits have really been steadfast on this, as always. The French and Germans required a little prodding. Now, how well all this holds together over time, as the events of last Tuesday recede, hard to say. It'll depend on what action we take when we take it. This is even more true of Musharraf's ability to keep his street in line. The man has a huge radical element to deal with, and if we react clumsily, he'll be seriously threatened, parts of the European coalition begin to waver, and that would affect the other states in his region. In 1991, we formed a comprehensive coalition. That should be our goal this time. >> Back to that problem. Sure, in '91 we built a terrific coalition. So big, it held us back. When we should've gone in after Saddam, we had all these fair-weather allies who said they wouldn't assist in bringing down a fellow Arab leader. We let the coalition define the mission. >> We needed bases on their territory. We needed overflight privileges, intelligence access, and other resources, as you well know. And that was a conventional conflict. This is virtually a guerrilla war, where those assets become exponentially more important. >> We're mixing issues here. I mean, if the problem is how potential allies will react when they find out what our intent is and how we plan to carry it out, hell, let's go there first. >> We would begin with six to eight CIA paramilitary teams on the ground in Afghanistan who would fan out and link up with various elements of the Northern Alliance. They lay the groundwork for the regular military, the Special Forces units that bring in both the firepower and the latest technology. They, in turn, lay the predicate for a larger military presence that would assist and support a total assault on Al Qaeda, and if necessary, the Taliban government, should they fail to rally the cause. >> How reliable are the receiving units for the Northern Alliance? We've made the mistake of backing unsure allies before. >> These people are desperate. At the moment, we're their only hope. But if this is as far as we go, it won't do the job. If we're serious about bringing down Al Qaeda and those who sail with it, the CIA needs authority to go after them anywhere in the world, to use whatever means necessary to cut off their head and their limbs, to act when the opportunity arises and not have to come back for presidential approval every time we want to strike. And it also means we have to get into bed with intelligence services and other assets some might find questionable. >> Currently off-limits. >> Yes. There are folks out there who don't view the sanctity of human rights the same way we do. They use means we would never employ. But by the same token, they often get results we never would. The third leg of the stool, supporting our existing operations. We're covert in over 75 countries. On the ground with human assets. We want to be more aggressive with this, want to do more than gather intelligence. Bribe with money, food, toys. Authorize break-ins, go lethal, whatever it takes. Finally, it all needs to be backed up with disruption of computer networks, financial links. This we can do given the funding, but above all, the flexibility. >> Frankly, I like the military aspect. Really like it. It gets us started while we prepare our ground forces. CIA can get in faster than we can. They can't do what we can in the longer haul, but for now... >> Good. No, good job. Sits well. >> Sir. >> For some years, law enforcement has been restricted to being reactive. We must become proactive. While the FBI is making great steps in investigating this attack, that is not good enough. There are no investigations after Armageddon. We have to disrupt domestic terrorism before it can bring about our Armageddon. Seek it wherever it hides. Schools or civic organizations. Even places of worship. I will be seeking a presidential finding to that effect. >> So, those are the three leading military options. An immediate cruise missile strike against known Al Qaeda camps. But they're mostly empty, and, uh, that option hasn't proved very successful in the past. Option number two combines missiles with a bombing campaign. >> With what targets? What's left worth mounting a high-cost bombing run against Afghanistan? >> There are Taliban installations. >> If we choose to go after the Taliban immediately without first giving them the opportunity to help us against Al Qaeda. >> Precisely. Which brings us to option number three, the one that meshes best with the CIA proposals. Special Forces lead the way, with missiles and bombers supporting our troops on the ground who will path find to rich targets and bolster the advance of the Northern Alliance. >> It depends a great deal on the Northern Alliance and just how allied they are. >> The Alliance, the whole area, it makes the Balkans look serene. That's what creates the danger of having the conflict spill over into the surrounding region. >> But if we succeed in ridding Afghanistan of Al Qaeda, we send a serious message to other regimes-- Iran, for example-- that there is no future in harboring terrorists. >> Do we? Sir, I can assure you the entire international community is in the coalition to eliminate Al Qaeda. But if we begin extending to other groups or states, those allies will begin dropping away. >> At some point we may be the only ones left standing, and that will have to be okay. That's why we're America. >> I doubt it will come to that. The number of allies might dwindle, but those who truly get it will remain solid. The Brits, certainly. >> But others will argue against it. Afghanistan is a graveyard of empires. The British were crushed there twice in the 19th century, the Russians sent packing in the last decade. >> Only because we gave the Afghanis Stinger missiles as part of the Cold War effort. >> Surely there is a consensus to remove the Taliban if it refuses to cooperate in the battle against Al Qaeda. >> But the Taliban is only the beginning of the problem. If we leave Saddam Hussein in place, we've accomplished very little in the long run. >> Uh, be careful. We do not want to declare war on all Islam. >> Not all Islam. Just those elements determined to destroy us. >> And Saddam Hussein is tied for first place with Usama bin Laden. >> UBL attacked us, not Saddam. >> Only because he was unable. But he's got the arms. He's been developing everything from nuclear weapons to smallpox to anthrax to... well, the whole range of weapons of mass destruction ever since he so frustrated the U.N. inspectors that they walked out, and the Security Council looked on and did nothing. All he's lacked is the means to deliver those weapons to our shores. Well, UBL has shown that he's got a system of delivery, and it is not an arsenal of ICBMs, but it is something just as deadly. Cells of radicals, suicide bombers, of the sort the Israelis deal with. >> We can't use 9/11 as a general warrant to hunt down anyone we think doesn't like us. If we're seen to do that, we won't have one, not one, Arab state in the coalition against UBL and the Taliban, which will weaken the resolve of certain Europeans. We'll be doomed going in. >> After what happened to us on 9/11, if we leave any of our enemies standing, it will embolden him. Back to the central issue. Does the coalition define the mission, or is it the other way around? >> Let's take a break. And when we reconvene, let's refocus on the military options in Afghanistan. Well, the outlines are becoming clearer. But so are the pitfalls. >> Iraq? >> Yes. And that graveyard of empires business? I want to hear this whole debate go on this afternoon. >> Is there any special mission for me? >> Listen. Just listen. And then we'll go over it together, but no decision today. [applause] [helicopter rotors whirring] >> No, I definitely agree with Rove on this one. For the last eight months we've been middling, Karen. We know that. We've had a success with the tax cut, sure, but education initiative stalled, defense transformation, faith based, no. We have to go to Congress for this speech. We speak to them, and then beyond-- the American people, foreign leaders, the press, everything. 9/11 was a new era. We have to start off new. >> Better start there. The whole tenor of the press is to try and fit whatever's planned into what they remember from '91. >> This is not gonna be a replay of the Gulf War except in two ways-- efficiency and winning public support. So you zero in on it. I remember the '60s. I've seen what can happen when you decide to go to war without explaining to the people what it's all about. You know, risking their blood, their treasure. No. This is not gonna be Gulf War II. >> Then we need to speak with a new voice, sir. New information. >> There'll be no shortage. Those decisions will be finalized at tomorrow morning's Executive Committee meeting. Now, there's things, basic things, to explain. Who are we going to war with? I mean, who are they? Radicals? Why do they hate us? Not because of what we do, because of what we are. >> What will victory mean? >> Justice. And finally, how it will be won. And that's for tomorrow morning's Exec Com meeting. [door opens] I've made up my mind. A course of action. And no half measures. This is all-out war. >> State is worried that an Afghan war might destabilize Pakistan. >> I know. They'll need a program to help shore up Musharraf. Our hands have been tied too long by fear-- fear of the Arab street, fear this regime may fall, that regime may turn nasty on us. And all the while, the world is getting more unfriendly. I mean, is that why we sacrificed so much to win the Cold War? Hmm? To shrink back from the peace? How is that undisclosed secure location, Dick? >> Very secure. And they haven't disclosed the location even to me. [laughter] >> Hey, you were great on the Russert show yesterday. [applause] Uh, can you see everyone? >> Yeah. >> All right. As promised, we are here to define the jobs for the first wave of the war on terror and terrorism. George, I'm gonna endorse your plan as proposed and sign that finding today. I want you to get your paramilitaries into Afghanistan, link up with the anti-Taliban forces. When that is completed, you will then lay the carpet to receive our regular ground troops. John. This reordering of priorities you outlined, absolutely appropriate. No greater priority for the CIA and FBI than to protect this country from further attacks. Moving you away from this strictly investigative and prosecution, we're gonna need a special package sent to Congress for legal authority, so start working on that. Oh, uh, Rummy, we're gonna need a similar package for overseas troops and installations. State. We're gonna make an ultimatum today to the Taliban. They're gonna hand over Usama bin Laden or suffer the consequences. Just make sure that the Taliban understand we are not out to destroy them, but the outcome, that's in their hands. All right. We are gonna take option number three. That is the missiles, bombs, and the boots on the ground. I want you to rain holy hell on them so when our-- when our soldiers hit the ground, the enemy is in flight. So you hit 'em hard. You hit 'em very, very, hard. Hard enough to send a signal to Syria and to Iran that there is a change in U.S. policy while they still have a chance to change their direction. And that'll give ol' Saddam pause to think. We are about to put American lives at risk. Nothing about this is tentative. This is all-out. >> Sir, an ultimatum today may be beyond reach. It has to be written. We have to secure our embassies. And by the time all that's done, well, they are some 10 hours ahead of us. >> You need until tomorrow morning? You got it. But make this statement strong. Make it powerful. Leave them terrified. This is part of the larger plan to help shore up Pakistan. So, uh, if there is a delay, we'll use that to develop the plan further. >> What if bin Laden has nukes or other WMDs? The CIA knows he's been trying for years, very hard. >> But not yet got them, as far as we know, right? >> Not as far as we know. >> Well, then to hold back our hand in fear that he might is just inviting him to use that time to go out and get 'em. Making sure he can't deploy what he's already got, that's the main focus of this undertaking. The danger of not acting, that far outweighs all the other problems. This post-Cold War world in which we are the only real power left standing isn't any nicer, it seems, than the one that preceded it. Weakness is despised. Strength is admired. And I believe that any further delay will be perceived as a weakness. Decisiveness, action, that is vital. >> What about Iraq? What if Saddam dips in his oar? >> Well, now, I believe, like you, he already has. '93 World Trade Center, if not this one. That man, he means us no good, and he is surely developing WMDs. So, write up a plan for him, but not here, not today. Let's just deal with Afghanistan. He'll just have to wait his turn. >> The idea that it's about justice. The president's already said it's about bringing them to justice. We need to hit that theme. >> Mm-hmm, and more. Krauthammer's column touches on it. It's not about a lawsuit, it's about a choice. Bringing them to justice or bringing justice to them. >> Make no mistake. The hour is coming when all Americans will be called upon to make sure these terrible events never befall us again. And I know you'll all be ready to do your share. Yeah? >> Sir, do you want bin Laden dead? >> There was an old poster out west. As I recall, it said, "Wanted dead or alive." >> Whoo! >> How's "Freedom is at war with fear"? >> "Freedom and fear are at war." Uh, make the sides clear. Okay, the president's due at the mosque. >> It is important to understand our battle is not with Islam, a religion of peace, but with those who would hijack it. Americans respect the Muslim faith. Our Muslim citizens have contributed so much to our national life. >> As speeches go, it's still a little rough, but it's very promising. You sure? [door opens] >> These are the findings and memoranda, the authority for this morning's decisions. >> Thank you. >> Oh... The speech? >> Yeah. Next to deciding on what to do, biggest challenge of all. >> You'll meet it. >> We all have to. There is no room for a Vietnam here. They hit the homeland. >> You'll do fine. Almost a perfect record so far. >> Almost? >> Well, just one, um, small item. Well, that "Wanted dead or alive" thing? The world isn't filled with Texans. A lot of people will not understand it. They'll think it, um, well, belligerent. And you have set such a good tone. And, um, one other little thing. Don't ever forget about how they treat women. That's a big part of this. >> It is. It surely is. And we won't forget that part of it. >> Good. >> Today the president spoke with Secretary-General Kofi Annan and also with President Cardoso of Brazil, who expressed his sympathy and solidarity. Also, the president spoke again with Prime Minister Chrétien of Canada. There will be a brief moment of remembrance on the White House lawn this morning, one week after the attacks. >> May God continue to bless America. You know, this current draft isn't working. So drop the FDR quotes. This isn't the time to raise ghosts. Look, this is a different kind of war, and this speech is about educating the people to that. Now, we have to be clear on the size of this, a war that may not end on my watch. And we have to pursue some form of normal living, or they win. This is what my presidency is all about. >> Our paramilitary teams are streaming online. The first unit is on its way to the Northern Alliance, will be in-country and in place within eight days. >> Our planning's to speed. Special Forces teams will be ready to follow the CIA teams within weeks if not days. Strike aircraft are moving into the region, and naval elements are steaming to nearby waters. >> We've already connected the hijackers to funding sources, and we'll be able to identify front organizations-- businesses and in some cases charities-- that need to be closed and assets frozen. Deputy Secretary Armitage is on his way back from Moscow after what can only be called a very successful trip. They understand our resolve and have accepted they have little recourse but to cooperate. The Arab states are falling into line, and Musharraf's televised statement can speak for itself. And the ultimatum to the Taliban will be on your desk this afternoon. >> Thank you. This shouldn't go through some back door. World needs to hear this. >> Into the speech. >> Into the speech. >> State reminds us that an emphasis on coalition-building will bolster the Secretary's efforts. Defense keeps harping on focus. The best defense is a good offense. Also, let's be careful about raising expectations. This is a war to destroy the terrorists' ability to threaten our way of life. >> The ending. The final reminder. That's everything. >> Yes, sir. >> It is my hope that in the months and years ahead, life will return almost to normal. Even grief recedes with time and grace. >> That's good. But more. >> Yes, sir. >> [thinking] I will not yield. I will not rest. I will not relent in waging this struggle for the security and freedom of the American people. [chatter] >> Mr. Speaker, the President of the United States. >> Mr. President. Mr. President. >> Please be seated, Mr. Secretary. Mr. Speaker, Mr. President Pro Temporate, members of Congress, and fellow Americans, in the normal course of events, presidents come to this chamber to report on the state of the union. Tonight, no such report is needed. It has already been delivered by the American people. My fellow citizens, for the last nine days, the entire world has seen for itself the state of our union, and it is strong. [crowd cheering and whistling] We have seen the courage of passengers who rushed terrorists to save others on the ground, passengers like an exceptional man named Todd Beamer. And would you please help me welcome his wife, Lisa Beamer, here tonight. [applause] We have seen the state of our union in the endurance of rescuers working past exhaustion. We have seen the unfurling of flags, the lighting of candles, the giving of blood, the saying of prayers in English, Hebrew, and Arabic. We have seen the decency of a loving and giving people who have made the grief of strangers their own. Tonight we are a country awakened to danger and called to defend freedom. Our grief has turned to anger, and anger to resolution. Whether we bring our enemies to justice or bring justice to our enemies, justice will be done. [applause] We will not forget the citizens of 80 other nations who died with our own-- dozens of Pakistanis, more than 130 Israelis, more than 250 citizens of India, men and women from El Salvador, Iran, Mexico, Canada, and Japan, and hundreds of British citizens. America has no greater friend than that of Great Britain. [applause] Thank you for coming, friend. Americans have many questions tonight. Who attacked our country? The evidence all points to a collection of loosely affiliated terrorist organizations known as Al Qaeda. They are to terror what the Mafia is to crime. But its goal is not making money. It is remaking the world and imposing its radical beliefs on people everywhere. Our war on terror begins with Al Qaeda, but it does not end there. We have seen their kind before. They are the heirs of all the murderous ideologies of the 20th century. They follow the path of fascism and Nazism and totalitarianism, and they will follow that path all the way to where it ends, in history's unmarked grave of discarded lies. [applause] Every nation, every region, now has a decision to make. Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists. [applause] From this day forward, any nation that continues to harbor or support terrorism will be regarded by the United States as a hostile regime. Freedom and fear are at war. Our nation, this generation, will lift a dark threat of violence from our people and our future. We will rally the world to this cause by our efforts, by our courage. And we will not tire, and we will not falter. We will not fail. [cheering] It is my hope that in the months and years ahead... life will return almost to normal. Even grief recedes with time and grace. But our resolve must not pass. Each of us will remember what happened that day and to whom it happened. We'll remember the moment the news came, where we were, what we were doing. Some will remember the image of a fire or a story of a rescue. Some will carry memories of a face and a voice gone forever. >> [Bush] And I will carry this. It is the police shield of a man named George Howard, who died at the World Trade Center trying to save others. It was given to me by his mom, Arlene, as a proud memorial to her son. It is my reminder of lives that ended and a task that does not end. [applause] In all that lies before us, may God grant us wisdom, and may He watch over the United States of America. Thank you. Thank you. ♪♪
