Blow attention. Blow over. Plan Dalet is the name of a planned Arabian terrorist operation- -against a target in Scandinavia. We don't know the details. No military in the Secret Service. We do our job, you do yours. If we worked together the man who killed the prime minister would have been caught within a week. Now it's about the Middle East. The best armed terrorists in the world. The best terrorists! The best state terrorists as well, if we let the Israeli join the club. Your problem at the firm is that you think in the past tense. Here at the company we operate in the future tense. Plan Dalet will be carried out here. On our territory. - "Coq Rouge?" - A code name. He's name is Carl Hamilton, lieutenant. Placed here with immediate effect. His official title will be: Chief executive officer, The National Police Board. Code name? Chief executive officer? - Does the police commissioner... - He's been informed. - Come in. Good. - Lieutenant Carl Hamilton. Folkesson, chief of the Middle East section. The chief of the Security Police Henrik P Näslund. - May l ask? The government informed? - You may ask but won't get an answer. I'll fix this. - Is that the guy I'm gonna work with? - Not with, under. Näslund! Näslund... I can't say anything, but I can probably put a stop to Plan Dalet. You?! What the military authorities seem to need half their forces for? - I know something they don't know. - What? No, I don't want to know. Just go ahead. Abort Plan Dalet and I'll get rid of that fucking count. The UN in Lebanon says that the growing number of casualties- -is due to the fact that the Israeli, in their attacks over refugee camps- -used bombs with delayed detonation- -in order to obstruct the relief work or even make it impossible. Even if Israeli Air Force earlier performed similar attacks- -the raid on Ein El Helowa has provoked protests in Israel. According to Shimon Perez it was.: "A bombastic killing without a military purpose." Näslund thinks the fucker was involved in the Palme murder. Ponti? - We were once on the same course. - Oh? Well, "nobody's perfect" as they say. I want all known details about Plan Dalet. Why? I'm supposed to stop Plan Dalet. That's my mission here. So I'd tell you more than I tell Näslund and the others? - Well, how can I work on the case? - There'll be no case. I know what it's all about, so they'll never go through with it. - Then it makes no difference. - Oh yes, it does. I give them a chance to withdraw without losing face. No one will know They have confidence in me. Forget Plan Dalet. I'll stop it. So I don't know what you're gonna do here. You don't want me here, right? We don't like members of the armed forces, specially not those who become chief executive officers all of a sudden. No, wait! I'm sorry about that last part. It was fucking clumsy. I always want to try to be funny. You're not an ordinary soldier. You've got some special training, right? I can't answer that, and you're probably not allowed to ask me that. PLO terrorist by the Lebanon border. Jerusalem. A bomb in an Jewish café. 21 injured, 6 dead. A bomb against a Lebanese mosque, 58 injured, 1 2 dead. Have you...ever killed anyone? No, I haven't. - So Plan Dalet would be like that? - Worse. Hamilton, Carl Gustaf Gilbert? You have to perform a shooting test. Right away, if it's OK with you. - Or you won't get a service pistol. - A service pistol? I suppose you've got your own. - Hey! Do you play golf? - No. - Pity. Good luck with the shooting. - Good luck to you. Folkesson. You'll have seven seconds to shoot all the five shots. To pass they must all hit the target, three of them inside the red circle. Are you going to stand like that? Ready... Erik, please, don't shoot at grandpa. - Hi, sis. - You're late, dear brother. - Only 20 minutes. - Hi. - Hi. Old antiquities! I'll give you better stuff. Dad's keys... - I'll keep mine. OK? - Yeah, OK. - Will he settle down in Switzerland? - Back when taxes are reduced, he said - A data consultant? What do they do? - Telephone calls, lunches, bills. Well, I suppose that's work, too. M1 6. Viva Zapata! - Can you stay here? - Since I grew up here I think so. That's an original conception. Can Erik stay here the week before Christmas? Got to go to Lausanne to help dad decorate. You're just consulting... - Not much just before Christmas! - Say yes or I'll shoot. OK. - Bye. - Great, we'll be in touch. THE SWEDISH CODE OF LAWS Plan Dalet. - Fristedt. Who the hell is that? - One of Näslund's gossipmongers. - Näslund, Näslund, it's Folkesson. - On the phone? No, he's... Yes, Näslund. Yes. Tokarev, a Russian gun. 7,62. A very rare weapon. - I was out on my morning walk. - And the man came towards you? I didn't see his face, but he had a green hood jacket. He just passed by. Was Folkesson in charge of the inspection of Palestinian terrorism? That's right. But his field of responsibility was even bigger. It embraced all security questions regarding the Middle East. - Are Palestinian terrorists excluded? - No, of course not. - So you don't know? - No comment. - But you have suspicions? - We follow different clues, yes. It was an Egyptian cigarette. Who smoke Egyptian cigarettes? A murder weapon left on a crime scene?! We can trace the gun in the Russians' weapon register. You don't believe the Russians will inform us if they're involved. Are they? Hell, it's a Russian gun. You said so yourself. For Christ's sake, Fristedt, when we get the bastard who did this... The upper desk drawer contains: A pocket diary, designated B1. A pen, designated B2, a... - ...peg. - Designated B3. A minicalculator of the brand... What about the murder weapon? A ruler, designated B5, a bunch of keys with... Skip that now. We'll do that later. There's a time for everything. What are you doing here? I'm Fristedt and this is Appeltoft. Hello, hello. - But who the hell are you? - "God's Revenge?" December 23! "God's Revenge?" "Last Number Dialed." - "Shulamit." - "Hanegbi." WAS IT THE PLO? - Shulamit, can you stop Plan Dalet? - Yes. You're making a mistake. What happened to the Swedish police can happen to you, too. Why the hell did you go there? Normally they're co-operative. If the Israeli know, others know too. What about "God's Revenge"? Forget it. The murder investigation comes first. I deal with the embassy. - It's about time! - What? I waited an hour and a half outside the movie. - Five years ago! - Exactly. What's your business nowadays? Computers. This is Carl, active in the pro- Palestine movement before your time. - This is... - Anders Hedlund. Petra Herngren. Then we have Arlanda. A green jacket with Air France to Paris 1 0:45 a.m. Helsingfors, two green jackets 1 1 :1 5 a.m. but one without a hood. - Copenhagen, 1 1 :30 a.m. one... - OK, good. - You know Ponti is under surveillance - Yes, why? He flew to Norway this morning, stays at the Grand Hotel in Oslo. An Israelian congress tomorrow... Ponti... If the Israeli know something, he must... - Ponti, of course. Ponti should know. - Yes, but he's in Norway now and... He happens to be dressed like that. A green hood jacket. Oslo on the line. - Has it something to do with us? - Classified. Just like always... Some shit we won't know about. Näslund wants to solve this on his own. He wants to show that it's the Kurds this time, too. - What else have we got? Fingerprints? - No, nothing. An Arabian butt and the number of the Tokarev gun. I've made a contact. "Reception, the 45th anniversary of the Romanian People's Army." Romanian embassy... Have you become a Communist, Fristedt? - Is it the serial number? - Yeah. Russian military attaché. - Hey, can you lend me 400? - You owe me 500 since last month. You'll have it. Don't tell Mom. Where are you off to? The restaurant? - Hi. - Hi. No, no, no... That's classified. - Will you get the bastard? - I hope so. - Now we're even. But you owe me 900. TOP SECRET So this is Näslund's secret principal clue. Ponti... He's at a Middle East conference in Oslo. Näslund says it'll happen there Let's hear the phone call again. - Hi, Ponti. The counterdemonstration? - If it's news, it'll be broadcasted. - Do you know who shot the SÄPO agent? - I'm busy right now. Why? You do what you find appropriate, and we'll see what I can do. Bye. The guy talking to Ponti is Anders Hedlund, a known security risk. Now Ponti is done... He's with a contact. The Norwegians took a photograph. They're at the Grand Hotel in Oslo. It fits. Murder weapon from Beirut. How do you know that, by the way? - Well... - For five years under surveillance... ...and we haven't nailed the fucker, but now... - Where is Hamilton? - No idea. That's the photo... Hamilton in Oslo?! With Ponti. - What the hell...? - It's not that unbelievable. They're both registered Communists in the Security Records. Shit! A hole in my sock, and Communists in the firm. - Suspect Ponti! So stupid... - Some shit from his compartment. Receipts, program from Täby Galopp, a manual, a driver's log and... - Notes on where he's been? - No, distance covered and filling-up. There's a note on the back of the program. "Call or check up 441106." 44 1 1 06... - Do they mend socks nowadays? - No idea. I'd like to know who's got the number 44 1 1 06. Thanks. "Stina's haberdasher's." A haberdasher's shop! Kiss my ass! Are you still alive? Näslund said he'd kill you. We've found the murderer. A haberdasher's shop. Why did you let in a security risk in the Security Service? - A security risk? What? Who? - A Communist on the Folkesson-murder! - So fucking awkward! - He's been specially trained. For what? He knows nothing about police work. The first thing he does is to contact a suspect in a murder case. Ponti. Have you got proof? Don't touch Ponti unless you've got something on him. Continue the surveillance but don't touch him. Such a great reporter... - Do I make myself clear? - Very. If Hamilton contacted a murder suspect he has his reasons. He's specially trained by the CIA. Officially a UCLA student, computers. But in reality, he's specially trained by the CIA. They gave us a professional killer, Näslund. We'll make use of that. 44 1 1 06. Bingo! The shop is in the Security Records. - Shit.... - I wonder why. - What are you doing now? - Checking why. Here... Petra Hernberg. Active in the pro-Palestine movement since 1 981. The owner's daughter. Writes for the Palestinian Front. There's more. Active in the pro-Palestine movement. Beirut at the same time as Hernberg. - Her cohab. - Anders Hedlund. Anders Hedlund, that's the... Shit... Fucking cop! Fucking fascist! We used up those insults already in the 60's. You'd better get fit, if you're gonna continue sitting here denying. - You here, too? Weren't you at... - ...the PLO house. - No, no! No talking over there. - Don't mind him. - What's it all about? - I don't know. - They keep on asking about Plan Dalet - Yeah. And "God's Revenge". Hedlund knows nothing about Plan Dalet or "God's Revenge". The main question now is if he killed Folkesson. August Strindberg, "The New Kingdom". Suspect literature? - This stereo was reported stolen. - Excellent! - Why did they bring that? - How the hell would I know. Arabian! Fristedt's clue prevails. The Tokarev gun. Beirut. - Fucking cops! - Johansson! Here. Arab. Södertälje. Probably in possession of weapons. Abelkader Musahraf. An Arab in Södertälje. Probably armed. Appeltoft, go with him! You never know what he's up to. Hamilton! Stop, for Christ's sake! Stop, for Christ's sake! Hell, the bullet proof vests! .44 Magnum. Not bad. If you shot Folkesson, it'll be a pleasure to cut your throat. Näslund, look at this. Well, Hedlund, now you're in trouble. He sold the stolen stereo to them. That's all. He didn't even know them. - Someone could have told me that. - No time for that... You almost cut the throat of a common fence and petty thief. He'll be prosecuted for illegal possession of a weapon. That's all. I couldn't know that. He could have been the killer. Could have been... The conditional! Didn't you work in the future tense? - He had a .44 Magnum. - What's that? A potato plant? Now that we have Hedlund, we don't need to bother about Plan Dalet. Well, Hamilton, I'm sorry but our co-operation stops here. Chief executive officers don't pull knives on petty thieves. Thank God the press didn't get wind of it. Näslund is like that. Now we take over. But not Beirut. Israel. It wouldn't look good if someone from the company was found shot in Beirut. - Shot in Israel would be good? - Not good, but better. Officially you go as the company's courier. - But Hanegbi will come to Stockholm. - No, now working in her home country. Your ticket and Shulamit's address to her countryside outside Jerusalem. He fell on the cartridges. - Well, Tokarev is a rare weapon. - Yes, but you can get ammunition. - I'm sure it was planted. - Interesting. Can you prove it? How the hell could I? - Hi. - Hi. I'll be away a week at the most. Here's his stuff. - Is it a customer? - Yeah, a customer. Make him brush his teeth, at least those in the upperjaw. His smile when he'll be a grown-up, I always tell him. Well, I'll be off. Bye, honey. Bye. - Hi. - Hi. Officially you go as a courier to Israel. They have sensitive material. An interrogation with Arab terrorists and a tape that might be of interest. - You are to contact colonel Meyer. - I met him at the embassy. - Meyer in Sweden? Then he should... - Hello. - Hello. - Your mission is to... - My name is Erik. What's yours? My name is Erik, too. - Your mission is to get that tape. Get Shulamit to tell you everything she knows. Who? Where? And when? - We know when. - It's in seven days. Is it Hedlund? You know him. I used to know you. - Is it him? - No, I don't know Hedlund. He's just one of the youngsters in the pro-Palestine movement. Are you married? No. Maybe we could date again? No. Is it because you're a cop? Here is a letter. - What does it say? - I wrote it. No confidence in me? The border to Israel. Their security zone goes up here. Above it it's OK. And western Beirut. Watch out, not to meet any fallangists... See you tomorrow. Bye. Ponti... - Hamilton! You scared me stiff. - I'm sorry about that. - Why are you here? - I want to talk to you. - Not selling computers in Norway? - It's not what you think. - I know a lot but not Arabic. - And "God's Revenge"? "God's Party" exists. An Arabian group of extremists. Maybe they were the ones Folkesson had tracked. If there's something the PLO dislikes it's fractionated small groups. If Palestinians were involved, the Palestinian intelligence knows. - You'd better ask Abu Al-Houl. - Abu Al-Houl? The Chief for the Palestinian intelligence. Abu Al-Houl. Is it Beirut? Probably. Does the PLO know that you're a SÄPO agent? - Yes, but I don't know how. - Then you can't go to Beirut. Then this could be a pure execution order. But since you're a former Palestinian activist it'll be OK. Do you know that you're under surveillance? Yes, they seem to want me to know about it. That's why you were in Oslo? Shit! Firs the Navy, then the political police. An old left-winger friend... - That's a bit thick! - Times have changed. No, times don't change. People change. Milk, milk, milk, milk, milk. Bread. Hamburgers in the fridge. And the microwave oven? How many minutes? One? I usually wait two. I'll be away three days. Will you manage that? - Hell, yes. - No swearing. Give this letter to Mr Hamilton when he arrives. Give me the letter she gave you. It can be a letter-bomb. No! No! - Hello. - Hi, it's me. How's it going? Things are piling up, so I'll stay a few more days. Will it be OK for you? Erik...hello. Erik, hello, hello! Hello... What are you doing? What's the noise? I'll be away a few more days. - Will you manage on your own? - It's OK. It doesn't matter. Good. And don't forget to brush your teeth and so on. Bye. Bye, bye. Someone knows I'm here. The Israeli are mute. I'll check the number now. On the other side of the border. In Beirut? Good. You do what you think is best. But I know nothing. Got it? - Why don't you have the sound on? - I know what he says. - Then why are you watching? - To see if he'll tell a lie. - Was it really that guy Hedlund? - He's been convicted. - How did you nail him? - A note. "Call or check up 441106", it said. - We run it through the computer. - I see, a social security number. Why do you want to see Abu Al-Houl? We can tell you all that you want. Abu Al-Houl is one of the most important persons within the PLO. See it as a diplomatic business. We co-operate with you, not with Israel as we used to. It could be of help in a future recognition of the PLO. Here is the number of the Russian gun. - What social security number? - 44 1 1 06. - Shit, so many names! - All born on November 6, 1 944. Kotvicz, Hämäneen, Stenlund, Andersen, Mendelsohn, Gustavsson. - 40 names at least! But he's here. - We'll do it after the weekend. After the weekend?! "God's Revenge, December 23." It's today. Erik! Erik! I didn't say how long you've been away. - Ljungdahl! - Are you working here again? Check this tape. There's a message but I don't know where. - We work with fingerprints. - Isn't it the technical squad? There's nothing more technical than this. - Do you know what day it is? - In the US they'd fix it in no time. There's no message. Just music. ...the first empty page, and it landed on December 23. Hamilton?! You've been granted leave? What are you doing here? Mendelsohn's Violin Concerto. Mendelsohn! He's on the list. Come. - What are you doing? - Celebrating Christmas. Alois Mendelsohn. 44 1 1 06, Naturalized Swede 1 97 4. - Jewish Defense League. An Israeli. - Mixing with Arabs? Fleminggatan. There, there... Good evening. - It would be a breach of duty. - Go ahead, for Christ's sake! Look at this... Weapon grease. But where the hell are they? Where and when? Where and when? You have five seconds. The PLO house. We stay here. Let's wait for Fristedt and the reinforcements. I'll just have a quick look. Shit, Hamilton! Appeltoft. - Appeltoft, Appeltoft, come... - Appeltoft here. Come. Appeltoft. Don't call me unless I've called you. Do you get me? Yes. Can you see anything? Come. They've killed everyone! They've killed everyone! Is everything OK? Hamilton! Do you hear me, Hamilton? Hamilton, Hamilton! This was Plan Dalet. Shulamit Hanegbi warned Folkesson and she tried to inform me. There's Folkesson's killer. A green hood jacket. - Israeli. - Israeli? The passport is from Libya. Hurry up, for Christ's sake! She's sitting there dying. Come on! For Christ's sake, Hamilton. Put her down. - Your man shot four Israeli. - Israeli? - The passports are Libyan. - A cover. They were Israeli. Same pattern as in Lillehammer 1973. Sayeret Matkal, God's Revenge. Israeli right wing extremists, it was to appear as an Arabian settlement. With Russian weapons. I came too late. Go home and tidy yourself up. Hedlund, innocent, must be released and the government must be informed. That's not your business, Näslund. For the moment you take no actions. You're under professional secrecy regarding Plan Dalet. Do you get me? - Any Swedes among the victims? - Is it an act of vengeance? Something like that. There are Swedes and Palestinians among the victims. - Were the perpetrators Palestinians? - They had Libyan passports. - PFLP, General Command, Avenidad? - We have no opinion about that. - Murder commandos sent by Kadaffi? - As I said they had Libyan passports. - Was Folkesson related to the attack? - Clearly, yes. Näslund, what will happen to the four dead bodies? - Will they be sent back to Libya? - That'll be a question for later on.
