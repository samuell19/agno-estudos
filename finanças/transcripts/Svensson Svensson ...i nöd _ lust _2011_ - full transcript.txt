You've been married for almost 30 years. - Yes. On Sunday. We'll be celebrating our 30th wedding anniversary. - Would. - Sorry? - Yeah, why do you think we're here? - Ye-es— You also have two adult children, Max and Lina. And from what I understand, you've never— - Of course we have. Obviously. Otherwise, Max and Lina wouldn't have existed. - That's not what I meant. As far as I understand, you've never been to a therapist together. - No. And frankly, I think it's too late. I want us to separate and move away from each other. - How do you feel, Gustav? I absolutely do not want us to separate and move away from each other. - No. Okay, so we have a clear starting point for our conversation. Lena, what do you think isn't working in your relationship? - We don't have a relationship. Gustav has a relationship with a ball—football. An extremely intimate one. - I simply ordered a satellite dish, and then— - He's been sitting on the TV couch watching football for a whole year. With no interruption other than to pop popcorn. What was the last thing you followed? Wasn't it the Iceland boys' teams series? - The Icelanders have come on strong lately. Their game system is based on a zone defence. - Gustav, I'm getting out of here! - Yes! I mean,after a marriage as long as yours it's no wonder you need some inspiration. A new perspective on the relationship. - There must be something we can do. We can't give up a week before our anniversary. - I actually have a suggestion for what you might do. There's a small guest house where I send couples in your situation. Svensson Svensson ... for better or worse Before the three of us meet regularly, I want you to spend a week there together. Take this book with you. - What did she call it? - Little repair book. Looks like a lot of good advice here. And we have to write down what we think of each other. - In that case a little repair book probably isn't enough. - Listen. She said people often change their minds about each other when they start to think about it. - But if you think about it again, you realise you were right in the first place. - Darling, you'll see. I'll surprise you on this trip. Feel that, baby? What a breath of fresh air. It's a perfect place for you to start loving me again. This week, I, Gustav Svensson, swear that I will devote myself only to you. I won't watch football, talk about football, think about football, even dream about football. - Good. So you know what's at stake. - I know what's at stake. Trust me, baby. Our marriage is actually more important than any football match on this planet. - Welcome. Are you the Svenssons? - Yes that's correct. At least for a little while longer. - Yes, exactly, it was Karin who sent you. - So you've ordered the romance package. - Exactly, with baked potatoes. - I see your wedding anniversary is on Sunday. So you're here to boost the love batteries a bit. - Or replace them entirely. You can see roughly what it's like. I've promised my husband one last chance. - He looks like he deserves it. - You think? - Do you want a room overlooking the garden or the river? - Can we have a look at the rooms, perhaps? - Yes, of course, of course. Yes, it's great to see that you're trying. I wish my ex husband had shown as much good will. But I'm keeping my eyes open. All of a sudden, he'll be standing before me, my dream prince. And then I'm going to eat him. - Maybe I'll have a look too. what I would like to get better at: 1. Compliments - Darling, what lovely hair you've got. - What? Was it ugly this morning? - No—no no. I just thought I'd pay you a compliment. - then I thought—there's nothing wrong with your hair. Hello! Darling. Hello. And Nils. - Mum, this is Sebastian. Sebastian, my Mum. - Welcome, Sebastian. - Thank you. It's nice here though. Gustav Svensson in a blazer and actually without a TV. You never thought you'd see that. - And no one thought you could make Scooby Doo with real people either. But anything's possible. Are you staying here? - Yes. A few days, along with that early-retired postman over there. - Are you married to him? - No. Well—yeah, but I don't know if I should continue to be. Because he's quite a pain, you see. Something you'll never be. Or who the hell knows? The years pass quickly. Suddenly—you eat too much, watch too much TV— get to 140 kilos and forget everything that's important. Oh God. Sorry, what am I going on about. - Nils? Come on. - Is he bothering you? - No no, not at all. It was nice to talk a little. - That goes here. You can't—it has to be at the bottom. That's it. - You have a lovely daughter. A nice little family there. - Sebastian isn't Nils's real father. It's actually the first time I've met him. The real father wasn't very nice. He cheated on Therese for three years with her best friend. - Yeah. That kind of thing's never easy. Hope it'll turn out well this time. - How do you feel now? Wasn't it Sunday you were supposed to celebrate your anniversary? - Yes—celebrate—I don't know. But at 7 on Sunday we'll have dinner. I promised Gustav I'd wear the same dress as when we got married. - I promise to cook something delicious for you. -Thanks. But no salad. Gustav gets so sad when he sees vegetables. Tommy Franzén. - Room 5, same as the old match shirt. - Yes. You remember that? A wonderful time, but it's long ago now. - Upstairs first floor. Breakfast from 7 to 9. - Thanks. I was just wondering what there is to do around here? If anything exciting is happening this week? - You're actually in luck. Are you interested in art? - Yes, very much so. - Just this week, our famous artist has his annual private viewing down in the village. - That's exciting! What's his name? - Lars Runke. - Do you know him? - No, I just lost track of the thought. Is there a cafe here if we wanted to go for a walk? - Yes, if you go along the river— - Sorry, is it OK to take a towel? - Sure, go ahead. Go to our fine patisserie. Just go out the back here and turn right. Drives the ball up. Edström runs into the gap, gets the ball— finds Tommy Franzén. Franzén goes past one, two and shoots the ball in the goal! In the goal! - That sounds great, doesn't it, honey? It's been a long time since you looked at me like that. God. I'm asking honestly, directly. Why? - Gustav, are you coming? Gustav, can you go up and grab two seats while I do a little shopping. - Just not too little. - Just go! - Are you finished, maybe? - Sure, it's fine, you can sit here. - It's going so well. Let's see what I can choose here. - Listen to me. I want that too. But Therese gets suspicious if I'm on the phone all the time. I can't, not now. I have to wait for the right opportunity. We just got here. I want to tell her. We can't—Yes— Therese's here now. I can't talk any more. Bye. Hello, darling. - Who were you talking to? - Oh, it—it was—my mother. What is it? - I just met a man down there who didn't put me in a good mood. - I didn't bring him here, I promise. I haven't even said Hi to him. - Calm down. It's not your fault Therese's new boyfriend is cheating. - Therese's new boyfriend? - Yes. Yes. Am I right in saying he wasn't in the '74 World Cup? - The one condition for this trip was that you wouldn't talk or even think about football! - Sorry darling, I forgot. It will absolutely not happen again, I promise. Stop that! - Ready? Shall we go? You can get a towel from the spa. - Do you want some oil or something? - No it's fine. Go on, I'll just grab this. - You're on holiday. Turn it off. Hello again. - Hi! - Let me say hello properly. I'm Therese. - Lena. - Looks cosy. I was thinking of taking a steam sauna. My boyfriend's on his way. - Isn't there anyone else you can think of to go to the steam room with? - Yes—at least—what are you thinking? - You're young, and if I were you I'd be looking around. - Shall we have a sauna first and a little winter bath afterwards? - That's a good idea. Cool off a bit. - This is Lena. This is Sebastian. - Hello. - Hello. Sorry, is there something wrong? Are you looking at me? - No, I— - Hello. Tommy. - Tommy Franzén! There are no words to describe what you've done for Sweden. How did you get past Breitner, the best back in the world? How old were you? You were 17 years old. A wonderboy. A wonderful wonderboy. - Well, a fan! - No, a brother. An inferior brother, but still a brother. Tommy, Tommy—this—this will be our only meeting. - I don't mind talking old football memories. - No, you don't— I'll say it exactly as it is. I have promised my wife— that this week for the first time in my entire life— not to say a single word about football. If I do, she'll leave me. - Gustav? - I have to ask you a favour. My wife mustn't know who you are. I'll explain later. Remember. You're not Tommy Franzén, the footballer. - Gustav, why aren't you coming? - I'm talking to someone I don't know and don't want to know either. Come on darling. - Oh Gustav, you can't say that. Don't you understand? Hello. My name's Lena Svensson. - Hello, Lena Svensson. - Sorry, I didn't catch your name? - My name? Lars Runke. - The artist? - Yes. - That's so exciting! Because I'm very interested in art myself. It's really not often you get to meet the artist himself. - Well no, now's your chance. - You're having an exhibition here, is that right? - Yes. - I'm looking forward to the viewing and I hope we might see more of each other before then. Come on. Gustav, come on now. We won't disturb you any more. Don't disturb him any more. When are the Svensson couple supposed to have their anniversary dinner? - Let's see—Sunday, seven o'clock. Hello again. - Yes, hi. - Things got a little crazy with your wife. - No no, you did well. You saved our marriage. - Oh really? - Yes, seriously. - It's a shame your wife doesn't have a different attitude towards football. Because you'd have been very welcome at the match. - The match? - Yeah, the match. It's Ralf, Ralf Edström, he's turning 60. We've arranged a little surprise party for him. Then we're playing a match in Bålstahallen. And it's kind of fun, actually. Because all the old WC team from '74 are coming. Ralf and Roland Sandberg and Ronnie Hellström. The German team's actually coming too. Beckenbauer, Breitner, Müller. - When exactly is this match? - It's on Sunday at seven o'clock. That was good. - Gustav. - Tommy. - What? Why did you call me Tommy? - It's a nice name. Yes, it's a sign of affection. Some say "my little dog-rose". But I call you Tommy. Cheers to us then, Tommy-girl. Morning everyone. Champagne breakfast! I must say we have an unusually nice gathering this week. And of course I hope that you'll have time to talk to each other a little too. I assume you've noticed our extra-special guest. - We've met. It was very nice. - Sorry, I must be ignorant, but I don't actually recognise you. - Don't you? For shame! So young, so uneducated. Come on, Lars. You shouldn't have to put up with this. - But— - But, I— - Sorry, I've been thinking. A chance like this, you only get once in a lifetime. So, we have to find a way to let me watch the match. - The match is on Sunday at 7. That's when you're having your anniversary dinner. - I know. And that's what we have to change. What about this? Do you think Ralf could have his birthday on a different day? The Ato Indians celebrate their birthday the day after they are born. "Radum" they call it. It means "the day after arrival". Couldn't Ralf do that? If the sports hall got a bomb threat, the match would have to be postponed for a day or two. I know a guy called Pettersson who'd enjoy making a call like that. Sure, this match thing is a great idea, but it'll work much better next week, believe me. - The match will kick off on Sunday at 7 o'clock. If I could do something about that, I would, but I can't now! - I know I have no right to ask this. But for Åby Ericson and Astrid Lindgren's sake, say yes. - What does Astrid Lindgren have to do with this? - Well, I don't know, but I usually name people everyone in Sweden likes. I could go for that one. - Yes, I think—why not a bigger one? - It would fit well. - It's pretty good. - Lena? - Hello, hi. - Can you help us with something? What do you think? Should you put names or just dates on engagement rings? - Ah, so you've decided to get engaged? - Yes, we have. - You and—? - Me and Therese. - Oh right. You've got her too. - Too? Why do you say that? - Yes, why do I say "too"? Do you know, Sebastian? - No, I don't think so. - You don't think so, no. Maybe you should tell us. - Tell you what? - Tell us what you're up to. Go on, tell us. - I work in the same industry as Therese's mother. I'm an operations manager for a hotel chain, I do balance sheets— - Well, maybe that's not quite what I had in mind. - Okay. - Yes, you should know I'm keeping my eyes on you. And they see everything. - Sure. - And they hear everything. Maybe it's the ears that hear. But they work together. The eyes and ears. Like two cops. - No, Gustav, it won't work! Stop it now! OK, I understand. It's OK, no problem. What is it? - Nothing. - Are you in pain? - No, only when I'm under a bit of pressure. But the medication takes away the worst of it. - Medication? Are you ill? - Don't say anything to my wife about this. Nothing. - But what exactly is it you have? - Cardiac mortesum. - What does that mean? That means six months left for postman Gustav Svensson. I hoped that maybe my last months might hold a little happiness. But thanks anyway, Tommy, for all your help. I hope life turns out better—for you. No! Bloody sausage! No! No, Gustav! - No, you can't do that! - Wait! - Gustav, listen to me. Although there isn't much time left— you have so much to live for. Believe me. Of course I'll stand up for you. Thanks. Refill? - No thank you, I'm fine. A new guest? - No, that was a prospective buyer for the hotel. - Are you going to sell? - I don't really want to, but it's hard keeping the books balanced. - That's a shame. - Yes, but I'm not giving up yet. My daughter's fiancé has asked to go through the finances. That might be a good thing. He says he's good at all that. Forgive me—I don't want to intrude in any way, but it's not the case that any of the guests— thinking mainly about that Svensson— he won't leave you alone? - No, not at all. Can you keep a secret? - Yes, of course. Go on. - He's not well. - I wouldn't want to go that far. Eccentric perhaps— - No no no. He's—he's seriously ill. He only has six months left. - No— Gustav? Gustav? I think you're admirable. - Yes. Yes, I understand what you're thinking. - What a man you are. -Brave, strong. - Lena? - Is there anything you would like me to do for you? - Lena! -Nothing in particular you're longing for? - I'm here. What do you want? Nothing, it's her. - I just have to say that I think you have a wondeful husband. Although now of course it's terribly sad. - Have you broken something? - I haven't done anything. I think she's lived alone for a very long time. - We'll make this a beautiful stay. Something you can carry with you later, Lena. Villa Laurin. Good morning. No, but as I said, I haven't been able to make a decision yet. You've made a good offer and I promise to get back to you as soon as I've decided. Yes. - Was that the prospective buyer? - Yes, he doesn't give up. - Yes, I understand from Therese that if you're forced to sell, it'll be quite a lot of money. - Yes, that's true, we own all the surrounding land, but I don't want to give up yet. - Of course not. But I still have to ask: is there a timescale? I mean - worst case scenario, when would you have to sell? - Well, it'd take 3-4 months to get everything turned around. But how's that going to happen? - You'll come up with something, you'll see. How long until she's forced to sell? 3-4 months. - There you are. - Yes, here I am. - Hi. What do you say? Shall we go out and build a snowman? Anyway. It makes me so angry. Imagine trying to cheat the person you live with. - Darling— Forgive me. I couldn't help myself. But think about it. This is a once in a lifetime chance. - What are you talking about? - What are you talking about? - About Sebastian the pig, of course. - Oh that pig. - What did you think? - No, I thought you meant another older pig. In spite of everything I'm so glad I have you. Even though you're crazy, you'd never try to trick me. Seeing you here makes me happy. You feel new. - Gustav, do you have a moment? - Of course. - You even got to know an artist. - I've thought of something. How about if I do a painting of you? - What? -That we tell Lena— - Yes? - oh, hi, Lena. I was just telling Gustav here, I'd like him to model for me. - Gustav? - Yes. Because I'm working on a theme: "Swedish kings on the battle field". I've got to Karl XII. - And Gustav would be—? - The old nun watching by the king's side. I'm going in anyway on Sunday to do some painting around 7. - On Sunday at 7? So, in the city? You're a genius! As it says in so many articles about him. Isn't that true, dear? - Yes, but that's when we're having our anniversary dinner, so— Come on. Although I have to say—what a thing to be painted by such a famous artist. How long do you think it would take to paint him? - Two 45-minute sessions. - Sorry? - Well—that's how—that's how I work. Two 45-minute sessions, unless there's an extension, of course. By—Gustav, so that he'll be right, relative to the king. - Gustav. I don't think there's any problem. We can celebrate our anniversary later when you come back. We can have a late supper. Rate your marriage: Scale 1-10 - God, it's beautiful. Are you sure about this now? - You know what? I thought I had loved before I met you. I was so wrong. - Are you having a good time? - Yes. Did you throw a pear at us? - So I did, that was mine, yes. Thanks. Are those the rings you have there, Sebbe? - Yes. I'm sorry, but can we have a little peace please? - Of course. Yes, that goes without saying. Yes. Which finger were you thinking of wearing your ring on then, Sebbe? -On that finger—there, maybe?! That must have hurt. I'm sorry. The bottle just slipped out of my hand. Let's just hope that finger doesn't swell up. Then you wouldn't be able to get the ring on. And you wouldn't be able to get engaged. Can I see? - No. You won't get a ring on that finger. What a shame. Then maybe you should go to your other girlfriend and console yourself with her for a while. - What? I have actually heard him on the phone with someone called Eva. Saying things like: "No no no. I haven't told Therese yet because she'd be so sad." And: "We need to hang up now because Therese is coming." - Hello Eva. It's Sebastian here again. We are having a great time. We're sitting here having an engagement dinner. Sure. You should say congratulations. Here she is. Hello? Yes, it's absolutely wonderful. It's great, great. Absolutely. You'll get him back on Monday. - Would you like to talk to my boss too? - Yes. I can say a few words. Yes, hi. My name is Lena. How does it feel to be a boss then? - Hello, hello. - I've booked a room. - What name? - Lars Runke. - Hello. - Hi there. - A new guest, I presume? - Yes, it's a beautiful guest house, this one. Been here before? - No. But I've been to Kalmar once before. That was exciting too. The postal academy's summer school. - So you're a postman? - Ex. Emails have made me and my ilk redundant. - Yeah, damn it, yes, but—that's life. Things evolve. Not me. - What work do you do? - I'm an artist. - It seems to be teeming with them here. - Oh really? Have you met any of my colleagues? - Yes, you could actually say that I have. - Ah, but now you get a hello from me. Lars. Lars Runke. - What? - Lars Runke. - No no no! You have to get out of here. No, I mean—this is a very bad old guest house. You shouldn't stay here. You're supposed to stay in a better boarding house a long way from here. No, I almost always stay here. I'm actually hanging some of my paintings tomorrow. - Yes, but, why? - It's a tradition that Linnea and I have. It was nice to meet you. I expect we'll run into each other. Congratulations on our wedding anniversary! Champagne breakfast in the dining room. Kiss! Gustav What're you waiting for? - I'm not waiting for anything. I'm standing here enjoying myself. - Doing what? - Being all alone here in reception. - But you're not. I'm here. - Yes I know. It's great fun. But right now, nice Uncle Gustav would like to be left in peace for a bit, you understand? - Are you going to do something stupid? - Where did you get that from, silly? - You're weird. - No, it's called funny. Here. - What's that? - A chicken leg. I took it from the buffet yesterday. You can have it if you just get out of here. 20 kronor then? - Hello. - Morning. Have you been painting? - Yes. Nothing like an early winter morning when you want to capture nature undisturbed. - What have you caught today? - A little fox. - Yes! Really world class if you ask me. - The paint hasn't really dried yet, so I have to be careful. Bye for now. - This is so typical! - Sorry? - It's so typical that I never get any messages. Like that letter, for example. It's in your pigeon-hole. Not mine. It's almost never anything important. There. I'm going through here anyway. - Strange. - Not bad news, I hope? - It's from someone called Bob Stevens. He has an art gallery in Bedrock Square in New York. Bedrock? Isn't that where the Flintstone family lives? - I don't know. Go on. - He's interested in representing me in the United States. He lands in Stockholm tonight and wants to meet me there. - I know we don't know each other. But when you see a person get such an opportunity, you have to step up and congratulate them. There's a train to Stockholm at 8.45. - Well— You can make it if you take the taxi that's waiting outside. - Are you absolutely sure it's all right? Will you help me hang the paintings? - You can trust me. I'll hang up the shi—the art. Feel free to stay an extra day in Stockholm. There's a lot to see. Hello darling. - It looks so nice, Gustav. - Eat up quick, and we'll have time for seconds before they clear the table. Hello. - Lena? - Yes. - Why are you under the table? - Because I made one helluva cock-up yesterday. I don't want them to see me. Gustav! Gustav! Can't we leave now? - We can't leave now. - Why not? I don't have the heart to let Lars Runke down. Have you? Oh my God. I really don't give a shit about Lars Runke. You can't say that, you can't, because this is a sensitive artist's soul. Van Gogh cut off his ear. Who knows what Runke might do? He's just a very, very strange man. Yes, he is very odd. He's very exciting, I think. A bit mysterious. You don't really know— - No no, on the contrary. Just the opposite. It doesn't feel like he's a real artist at all. I spoke to him yesterday. He didn't even know who Monet was. - No, he doesn't know who Monet is, because it's all about prestige, artistic prestige. He pretends not to know artists other than himself. - Nonsense. - Honey, listen to me now. Think about why we're here. - Can we go to this viewing together then? - Viewing? - Runke. He's showing his art and talking about it today. There. - Oh damn. - You're crazy. What the hell can I say? I know nothing about art. It's nothing remarkable. Walk around looking haughty. Explain to Lena what the paintings represent. Listen. It's important. I have a feeling she's getting suspicious. - Yes, but we have to go soon. I have to warm up at least an hour before the match. - Believe me. This will be enough of a warm-up. Good morning, good morning. Listen. If Lena finds out what the two of us are up to, I'll have to live the rest of my life alone. At worst with Pettersson. - Pettersson? - Has Lars got his paintings up yet? - Yes. - Where is he? - He—he left. - Has he gone? - Yes, he's left. - Yeah. See you later then. - Sure. OK. Are you ready for your first viewing? Well, sweetheart. Already enjoying yourself, I see. What do you say, Lars? How does it feel to see your art admired like this? - It's funny. - I'm curious to hear about how you do it. But maybe you can tell us a little about your artwork? That painting for example. - Yes, here—here— rather— - What about this one? - A dog. He was quite tired and so— - And this one over here? - Yes— - What can we say about this one? - That one—well— - It's a good thing you don't say too much. You shouldn't talk art into pieces. Let art work in silence. Live in silence— - I think he's a fraud. - No no. - Wait, you'll see. Well, I was just thinking. Before you use our anniversary to paint my husband, could I ask a tiny little favour? - It's because I would also like to be painted. - No, Lena, no no no. - But why not? It doesn't have to be anything big, majestic like Gustav's painting. A small portrait would just be so nice. - I am so curious to see Lars at work. - There's nothing to see. You see, I think there is. So if you gather your things, we can meet in ten minutes. - Is here all right? - Here's perfect. Here—I like it here. There's air and— Here. -Yes. - Will this be all right now? - Yes. Ah, that's incredible. Baby, you should see this. It's so beautiful. Can you—can you stretch that arm out a little bit? - Like this? -Can you—can you look like it's windy? - Well, when Tommy interprets your movements— - You just said Tommy again. - Yes, I like that name. When a person moves me, I call that person Tommy. You know that little girl with glasses selling mayflowers. I called her Tommy. - Yes, forget the rest. Because I want to look now. - Stop! - What's the matter now? - Lena, my Lena— - Yes? - You, me and the children— -Why are you dragging Max and Lina into this? - Of course I want to continue meeting them too. - Gustav. What are you talking about? - Gustav? - Don't you realise it's over? - It's ready now. - It's you! - A fox? - Yes, a fox. That's how I see you. Soft, but still a little dangerous. Well, it'll take about an hour for the paint to dry. - I don't know what to say. I really doubted your painting ability, but—you are incredibly skilful. And so fast. - A fox? - Yes. - I hope your painting will be just as nice. And Gustav. You must hurry back, because Linnea promised to arrange that supper for us. Oh and— I was able to get into my wedding dress. What is it? - Just a moment. - Gustav—! - Someone's tricked me. There is no Bob Stevens. There isn't even a museum with that name. - What are you saying? Who in the world could do something like that? - I really wonder about that. - Some real fool, probably. Some sick, sick fool. It was pure luck that I called and double-checked. I had to get off in Mjölby and take a taxi back here. - For God's sake—! Hello Eva. It's Sebastian. That was a close call yesterday. No, it went well. Yeah. But there's some crazy fucking lady running around here. No, now we can talk. - Gustav, Gustav, we have to go now. Hello. - Who do I have the honour of—? - Runke. Lars Runke. Hello. - Are you the artist? - Yes. Gustav, we're leaving now. - Are those your paintings hanging there? - Yes, indeed, a real bunch of Runkare up there. Gustav, come on now. - That's him. He must be the one who sent me away. - Go and call the police. - But—why? - I've been involved in this kind of thing before. Go and call the police. Go, go, go! What an honour. I mean. To stand like this face to face with such a successful artist. - That's nice. I'm in a bit of a hurry. - Gustav! - No, Therese suspects nothing. No no. Thanks for putting up with this hassle. Has the breakdown finally happened? Out with the pain. What is sad must be allowed to be sad. When I was a child, I had a little tame bullfinch. He lived in a small shoe box with cotton wool. One morning he didn't wake up. And I shouted at him: "Fly! Fly!" He would never fly again. - It took me a long time to admit it. - Yeah. - But— My advice to you is simply—enjoy. Enjoy your Gustav now. There must still be time for a small toast. Your health. - Well—yes, a small one then. Cheers to those who are genuine artists. Death to the fakes. - Yeah, just kill them—cheers, I mean. - Wasn't that a bit sweet? Wasn't it? - Yes, maybe, you could be right. -Did you call the police? - The police were unfortunately not at home. - No problem. I don't think our friend will make any attempt to escape. He'll sleep for two days. - Sleep for two days? - Gustav, if our plan is to work, we have to leave now. - Plan? Are you in on this? - No, this isn't the plan you're thinking of, it's a completely different plan. - We're going to trick Gustav's wife so he can go to a football match. Nothing dangerous. - Does this plan have anything to do with your pretending to be Lars Runke? - Why do you say that? - Because I am Lars Runke. - You can deal with this one, Gustav? - Does this plan have anything to do with me going halfway to Stockholm today? - Maybe a bit. - Because you wanted to trick your wife? - Well, trick— I love my wife more than anything else. But I love football too. - Gustav. Haven't you left yet? - Please please. Don't say anything to her. - Unfortunately, as an artist, you have to be true both to yourself and your surroundings. I'm afraid I have some sad things to tell you. - Gustav, what have you been up to now? Yes, you had something to tell me? Well—? - Couldn't you start? - What? - Is it—it—it's very dark in here surely? - I don't have time for this. Now what was so important? - It's terrible. - Gustav, who the hell is this crazy person? That question is the poodle's— daddy— - I'll give you exactly one minute to get to the point. - Thanks. - Who are you? - I'm an artist. And my name— Wait! Wait! - What are you doing? - We can't risk him telling her how everything is. No problem. We haven't killed him. He's just a drunk. - First you make me lie to your wife and now we're going to kidnap an artist here too! - At least I'm fun to be with? - Uncle's head is just a little sleepy. Thank you for giving us this chance. I think we'll get through this! - But what shall we do? We can't leave him here. - I'll tuck him in a little. - If anyone sees him, they'll think he's dead. There. Now he looks like a real artist. Yes. - Sorry. - Come on! Well, I suppose congratulations are due. - What for? - For your success in deceiving Therese. - Please. I asked you to leave me alone. - What have you got there? Oh, Linnea's accounts! - Nils? Nils? Are you coming? We have to go now. Hi, I thought you were going shopping? - Yes, we are. We're just going to pick up the mail. -What are you doing? Work? - I'm going through some numbers. - Can't you show us what the numbers are, Sebastian? - It's nothing interesting, just boring. - That's it, I've had enough of this. I've been made out to be an idiot even though I was right all along. Tell the truth! You're hiding something from Therese. - Yes, I'm hiding something from Therese. - Yes. - I'm hiding the fact that I'm trying to save this guest house. I'm trying to get my boss—Eva—to understand— that maybe we should buy Villa Laurin so it doesn't have to go bankrupt. Your mother will of course continue to work here. This was sort of meant as a wedding present for you. But then I didn't want to say anything in case it didn't work out. Now I'm trying to add up all the numbers. - Oh darling. What are you staring at? I told you he was up to something. It wasn't my damn fault it was something good. Yes, may he live, yes, may he live, yes, may he live for a hundred years, yes he will live, yes he will live, yes, he will live for hundreds of years! Four hearty cheers for Ralf! Hip, hip! Long may he live! Hooray, hooray, hooray, hooray! There's the guy I was talking about. Hello? Linnea? - Hello? - This is Lars Runke here. - You do sound strange. Has anything happened? - Yes, you could probably say that. Yes! Yes! No! Nearly a year later Hello. Am I disturbing you? - Hello. No not at all. - I just wanted to let you know that I found the DVD box I was talking about, if you'd like to see it. - I'm sorry, I don't have time now, because I'm leaving tonight. But I'd love to when I come back. - I don't suppose you have time for a beer or something before you go? - Yes, I have. Gustav Svensson. Hello, Pettersson. Hello. Yes, Christmas bowling? It's a tradition? What do you mean by that? Ah, it's a new tradition. Okay. So who's going to be there? You and me? Yeah— We'll see. I have to think about it a bit, you know. Okay, let's do it Bye. Is that Max? It's Mum. I'm on my way home now. And I wanted to ask if you could still drive me to the airport? God, that's so kind. See you in a while then. Take care. Say hello to Ebba. Kiss, kiss. Hello. - Hello. I asked Max if I could drive you instead. Is that OK? - Yes, that's OK. - I beat Pettersson at bowling. - Well—congratulations. - At least—he was late, so I was there a bit before him. I got a head start. But I did win. Where are you going? - Nice. I'll be staying with Marianne over Christmas and New Year. What about you? - Max and Lina are coming over after Donald Duck. - Will there be any more besides Max and Lina? - What? - On Christmas Eve. - Yeah yeah. Yes, everyone's coming. John and the children and Ebba. - Not Pettersson, right? - No, not Petterson. I thought we needed to be apart for a bit. - That sounds wise. You have to be careful with love. - Yes, you do. - Don't you think it's strange I didn't go to Nice? - Yes, but I didn't dare ask why. - Gustav, in one African tribe a man goes into the desert every 10 years and buries himself in a pit. He wants to find out what's important in this life. - I don't need a pit. But I understand if you want to bury me. Because I know what's important. - And that is? - You. And football. In other words, I know what I did to you was terrible and I am truly sorry. But I can't help that I—that I'm— Gustav Svensson. - No, I know. But you can have a little too much of him and then you get tired— even if you actually like him. - Do you like me? - Yes, of course I do, you idiot—I suppose. I've tried not to. I've had beer with Björn. I've even gone to a restaurant with that idiot in the finance department. - Jörgen? - Yes. I tried to think it was fun, but it wasn't. It was just normal. - So you mean that— - I don't know what I mean. But I realised that I married Gustav Svensson. And that a bit of football is sometimes included. And calls to Pettersson sometimes. And worst case scenario, that pizza you make on Fridays. The one with caviar and chives. - That's the nicest thing you've ever said to me. I mean, apart from the bit where you say you think I look like Ingemar Stenmark when I'm asleep. - Ingemar Mundebo, I said. - Oh, OK. There's something nice about Christmas anyway. If it's not SVT running Scooby Doo again, it's you coming to tell me you love me. - I didn't say that. - No, but I can feel it. - You know the margins are small now? - Yes, I know that. Exciting times, honey. Exciting times! English subtitles by faxeholm1234 and jeremys TNT 2023
