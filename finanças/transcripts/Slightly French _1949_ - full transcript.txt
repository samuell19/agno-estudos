Cut! Cut! Cut it! Here you are, Mr. Gayle. It's worth all those takes. That one was terrific. That makes an even one of us who thinks so. Ms. La Tour. Yes, Mr. Gayle? Can you tell me why they call you the French Fireball? John, I droop like the cabbage. How can I be the ball of fire when I amfatiguee to exhaustment? Oh, it seems to me you extinguish easily. But then, when an actress reaches your age... My age? Oh, ça ç'est trop! I have danced this dance 20 times! Do you saymercionce? No! You say,"Encore! Encore!Again! Again!" And now, I am the old bag! Well, I say no, no, no and no! That's it! That's what I want! Start the playback! Pick it up there! When they tell to me you're directing picture, I said, "No! This man is a slave driver." Twenty-six takes! They insist. I listen! I am a fool! But now I have say no! No more! No more every day like this! This is finished, through! I dance no more! Jamais!Never! Playback! Never! Action! Cut it! Cut it! Brother, wait till Hyde hears about this. Yeah. And I'm just the guy that can tell him. But, Doug, there's a limit. Gayle's got every department on this lot in a tizzy! He had a set torn down because one window was out of place! He told the production manager to keep off the stage! All right, all right! They know his reputation. They're looking for trouble. They don't have to look, brother! Now, Doug, I know you're old classmates. I know how fond you are of him. But being kept out of pictures for two years hasn't taught him a thing! He's still the same self-opinionated, egotistical-- John's a perfectionist! He knows what he wants, he won't compromise! He's turning out a great piece, that's what counts. Wait till they see the picture. Everybody'll go flat on their faces! Mr. Hyde? Yes? Stage 9 just called. Ms. La Tour just went flat on her face. What? All right. Let's wrap it up. Nine in the morning, same scene from the beginning, playback. Where's Yvonne? I sent her home. A little dizzy spell. Phone for my car, will you? Oh, wait a minute, Gayle! All right, wrap it up! Everybody on the set, 9:00, tomorrow morning! Dizzy spell, huh? The dizzy one around here is the guy who talked J.B. into letting Gayle on this lot! Leaving for the day, Mr. Gayle? Mr. Gayle, sir. Where's Andrews? I sent him on an errand. How do I know you'd want the car so early? La Tour needs the afternoon to get her nerves restrung. Oh! Here we go again. Are you implying I'm hard to get along with? For the people who work with you, yes. That was the general insinuendo. Insinuation or innuendo. You go to your church, and I'll go to mine. Why can't you tat antimacassars? Embroider cummerbunds or raise aspidistras. Any hobby except that silly business? That business is what I love. It's all I wanna do. It's in my blood. Can't you understand that, Louisa? It's my food and drink. That I understand. Food and drink. And I know a place near here where we can get some. There? Why not? A little gaiety must snap you out of it. Anyway, it positively smells of food. It positively smells, period. 168, right on the nose! Sorry, lady. Who's next? Let me guess your weight, sir. If I fail to guess your weight within three pounds, you win a beautiful prize. Step right up, folks, to see the beauties of Brazil. The heat waves, here to break your thermometer. Step right up, folks, and don't stop. For the small sum of a dime. Thank you. While I dola rumba, I shakemis maracas. Buy these tickets, step inside. You'd like to see me, no? That was Lolita, ladies and gentlemen! She's not bad. That's where La Tour belongs, in a carnival. Why don't you unlax? Forget the picture. I didn't mention it. But you're thinking about it. I say, maybe you'll be pleasant if you ate something. I'm not hungry. Oh, come on then. Listen to me. Coney Island hotdogs! Coney Island hotdogs! Say, a loaf of bread, a pound of meat, and all the mustard you can eat. Step right up, governor. Here you are. Let the lady see what the old Limehouse looks like. What you've heard is true. What you've guessed ain't half of it. Now, come on the inside and see it all. My name is Chelly Flowel. She means Cherry Flower, folks. You know the Chinese have a great difficulty in pronouncing the English R. Go ahead, dearie. When I 14-year-old, my cruel father had too much Inka-pa. Inka-pa, folks, is the Chinese equivalent to bourbon or Scotch. My wicked father make life very sad for me. So Chelly Flower run away and come here to old Limehouse. Thank you. Step right this way, folks, and see the evil faces in the London fog! The waterfront dimes like old Harry himself! The dens of Chinatown! Our guide will see you through, folks, so don't be afraid! Come on, governor, hurry up here, you're all set. Isn't that the girl from the Brazil show? The Chinese girl? Sure. A wig, a different accent. It's perfectly possible. It could be. You know women better than I do. Take a powder from the Pampas? You buy ticket, you see me. You no buy ticket, you no see me. But you are Lolita, aren't you? No. Me Chelly Flower. Excuse me. I rush inside. What happened to the Gayle charm? My interest was purely technical. Oh, look, cotton candy. Buy me another. Oh, that's disgusting. How can you eat so much? Mmm. Health, youth, good, clean thoughts, and a glass of hot water every morning. Yes, folks, this show is just starting! It's just commencing. See theStreets of Paris! See those luscious lovelies that were brought over here from Paris, France. Yes, sir, those dollies are the follies! Look! Look at that girl! Mmm. Standard equipment. I'm talking about her face. Yeah, looks vaguely familiar. Why, sure she is! That's the same girl. What? With a new look. Just here, ladies and gentlemen, is Mademoiselle Fifi! A tasty little tidbit, but only a sample of what you'll see on the inside! Yes, sir! Say, you get around, don't you? Oh,mais oui. I travel all the way from my dearest France. Satisfied? Perfectly. Poor kid. She certainly works hard, doesn't she? Is that bad? At least she has a job. Yeah. Let's get out of here. I got an early call. Ladies and gentlemen, the show's just starting! It's just commencing! Our beautiful galaxy... Thank you very much, sir. Nine o'clock. The whole company on the set and not a sign of La Tour. Know what J.B. will say if she's seriously ill? You're wasting a lot of good worry, Marty. It can't be much! It can't... I'll go over to the set with you. Uh-oh. Go on. Yes, J.B.? Yvonne's doctor just called, Doug. What is it, J.B., a touch of indigestion? He says it's nervous exhaustion. She'll have to rest six or eight months. Six or... Oh, no! I've had Gayle sent over to your office. I don't have to tell you what to do about him, do I? That you don't, J.B. When I get finished with him-- Good. I'll call you back. Yes, sir. Well... Have you heard about La Tour? Just now. And you've got to fire me, so don't beat around the bush. John. You're the greatest guy in the world off a picture set. Thanks for making it so easy for me. I'm not. And I'm not going to be fired. What? I couldn't give you the argument until you said I was. But you know I have to or I won't be working here! That's what I'm thinking of, Doug. Your career. Mine doesn't matter. 'Cause I've put my life's blood into this picture. It was my idea, my story. You're the one who stuck his neck out. I fail, it's a blot on your career. I can't let you down! I can't let you fire me! Well, I have to. If you had heard the old man-- That's it. J.B. has poured a lot of money into this picture. If he has to shelve it, naturally, he'll take it as hard as a Wisconsin winter. But if we can keep going-- How? You know La Tour can't be replaced. When she refused to do the picture, we tested every possibility in the business. She's absolutely unique in her field! Granted. There isn't another French girl. So we change the characterization! She's an American living in Paris! John, John, you're wasting my time and your own. Even if I consider it, the old man wouldn't. Will you ask him? No! I'm out on a limb now. It's better than being out on your ear. Ask him. No, no, no, no, and that's final! You're right. I beat around the bush. I won't this time. I'm tired of going to bat for you. I'm gonna tell J.B. exactly what-- Hi, I was just gonna call you, J.B., I-- What have you done with Gayle? Well, I was just firing him, J.B., when I-- When I got a terrific idea. If we just make a slight change in the story, we can still fulfill our commitment. The girl isn't French, see? She's an American girl, living in Paris. Then we can use any of the stars we have on the lot-- If the girl isn't French, the picture isn't worth a nickel. Yes, I know, but we could-- Yes, but we could salvage more than half the stuff we shot, and besides, Gayle has won a few awards for us. No. Get that menace offthis lot, and that's an order. Yes, sir. Thanks for trying, baby. If you die first, I'll send you some flowers. All right, friends and neighbors, this show here is just starting! It's just commencing! Don't fear to step inside... How many, sir? Thank you, sir. See theStreets of Paris, ladies and gentlemen! Thank you. I hope you like the show. If you don't, when you come out, get your money back. Try and get it. Right, folks, see these luscious lovelies that we've imported over here! ♪ I'm Fifi ♪ ♪ From the Folies Bergere ♪ ♪ Fifi and I'm devil-may-care ♪ ♪ Would you buy A midnight snack for me? ♪ ♪ Take me home ♪ ♪ And scratch my back for me ♪ ♪ I'm Fifi ♪ ♪ And no one in Paris ♪ ♪ Can cancan like me ♪ ♪ If you want to take A little promenade ♪ ♪ On the boule, boule Boule, boulevard ♪ ♪ Call Fifi ♪ ♪ From the Folies Bergere ♪ ♪ And I'll be there ♪ ♪ Fi, Fifi ♪ ♪ From the Folies Bergere ♪ ♪ Fi, Fifi ♪ ♪ And I'm devil-may-care ♪ ♪ Marry me ♪ ♪ I make you crepes suzettes ♪ ♪ Fill half a dozen bassinets ♪ ♪ I'm Fifi ♪ ♪ And no one in Paris ♪ ♪ Can cancan like me ♪ ♪ Would you like someone To sing your praise for you ♪ ♪ Call upon your boss And get a raise for you ♪ ♪ Call Fifi ♪ ♪ From the Folies Bergere ♪ ♪ And I'll be there ♪ ♪ And I'll be there ♪ It's the second dressing room down there.

They let anybody pet 'em, but I can't say the same for me, see. Clearly. I came to compliment you on your versatility. Look, just 'cause I work in a creep show don't give you a right to insult me. Oh, I'm not. I'm complimenting you. Well, I wish I could say the same for you. Look, I think you have talent. Sure. I ought to be in pictures. That's right-- Listen, chum, you smell of money. Can't you afford to buy a new line? But I'm sincere. I am John Gayle. So what? Well, doesn't the name John Gayle mean anything to you? I guess it ought to. I read the funnies. Don't you ever see pictures? Oh, sure. Between the Brazil show and theStreets of Paris, I got almost an hour to do anything I want. Does that answer your question? Listen, I'm a motion picture director. Oh, so that's the caper, huh? You're gonna make a big motion picture star out of me! Why not? I think you have the ability. Have you ever heard of Yvonne La Tour? It's her stuff I copy for theStreetsroutine. She collapsed on the set. Read it in the newspapers. I'm directing the picture. I've got to finish. That's why I came to see you. Well, maybe later. You said you had an hour. I got to eat! Well, that's a great-- Great idea! Brother, you stick like glue. Do you think you can stand the tariff in this joint? I think so. Let's go. Honest, you're on the level? Mm-hmm. Yeah. You're not just buttering me? Cross my heart and hope to make a picture. But I can't speak French. With your knack for accents, you'll learn it in nothing flat. What about the dances? Why-- The one I do I put together myself. I'll get you a teacher. My voice? It's pleasant, and it has quality. Yeah, but she acts too. That is my department. You certainly sound sure. I am. I know you can do it. You have aptitude, spirit and intelligence. You're not afraid of hard work. It'll be tough. Tougher than what you're doing now. But it'll be worth it. Fame, fortune, your name in lights. Rochelle-- What's your last name? O'Leary. Mary O'Leary. O'Leary. My mother was Irish. My father was a plumber. O'Leary. Olivia. Rochelle Olivia. How would that look on a marquee? Gee, great, but-- Can't you see your name in front of theaters, your picture on the cover of magazines, your name in the gossip columns? Yeah, but-- Think of it. People staring in the streets. Whispering in the theater as you walk down. Nightclub MCs introducing you as a guest. The public copying your clothes. Women envying your furs and jewels. All the money you can ever use. How does that sound, Mary? So wonderful. It's a shame I can't do it. But you can. You will do it! Oh, no, I won't. I'd never get away with it. All of a sudden, somebody would come and tap me on the shoulder and say: "Hey, Ms. Olivia, your O'Leary is showing." Mary, you have to do it. You have to do it for me. I have poured my life's blood into this picture. I've thought of nothing else day and night. Now it looks as if it's slipping away from me. I wanna finish it. It means everything to me. And only you can give me the chance. Will you help me? I guess I can try. Thanks. Now, how long will it take you to pack? Pack? I'll take you home with me tonight. Home with--? I can't let you be seen until you're ready. With the instruction you're gonna have, you won't have a chance to be alone. Now, how long will it take? Well... Vi can take my place. She did when I was sick. Then I gotta go tell the boss I'm quitting. Then I'll get packed and... Can you meet me here in 10 minutes? Good girl. Maybe I'm smart, maybe I got a head full of feathers, but, brother, you sure make with the influence. Pa didn't know what "procrastinating" meant, so he told the teacher that if she'd swear I was doing it, that he'd beat me up. And I told him that if he did, I'd run away. So she did, and he did, and I did, and that's all. Hey, what goes with the hotel? That's my house. Good evening, madam. Hello. Good evening, sir. Evening, put that in the north room. Indeed, sir. You're a game trouper, Mary. I want more than ever to make this venture a success for you. Gee, thanks, Mr. Gayle. John. John. I'm sorry I was such a blister. I mean about trying to give you the brush-off and all. You were scared. Let's face it. Could be. You're not anymore. Nothing in this house to be afraid of. I never want you upset or startled or-- Hey, what are you--? The one man in the world who mustn't see you. But-- But-- I'm sorry I missed John. Hiya, Doug, Louisa, lovely evening, isn't it? What are you doing? I? Doing? What should I be doing? Hanging up my hat, of course. In there? Why not? That's where Wilson always puts them, isn't it? Not that I knew of. Well, Doug-- Douglas dropped by to see how you were feeling. Thought you might be kind of low after-- Low! Far from it. I feel great, really great. Louisa's right, I'm bun-headed fooling around with this picture racket. You're not going to direct anymore? Realized I'm not temperamentally fitted for it. I'm gonna forget the whole business. Well, I'm certainly relieved, John. I thought you'd like to hear that. Yeah, well-- I'm glad you dropped by, fellow. Sorry you're leaving. Thanks for your thoughtfulness. Yeah, I've got to get back. J.B.'s running stuff, and I always have to-- Where you going? To get my hat. You said Wilson put it in there. Uh, no! No, no, don't. Um... I mean, don't bother. You didn't have to scare me to death, did you? You'd think you had something hidden in here. Everybody's got a skeleton in their closet. Good night, and thanks again. I'm glad everything's on the up-and-up. Good night. Good night, Louisa. See you, Doug. You could've fooled me. Ah! Skeleton, huh? Pretty well-padded. I couldn't have Doug see her, could I? Not until I have her ready to step into La Tour's shoes. Why not? I'm fool enough to ask. You know what an insecure guy he is. He'd never have faith unless he thought she was authentic. All he'll see is Rochelle Olivia. Cousin of a friend of yours. From France. French cousin. Wait a minute. You didn't mean what you said about not making pictures? Of course not. Louisa, this is Mary O'Leary. She's going to stay with us. I gathered that. How do you do, Mary? Hello. I'm sure you'll be as happy here as you would be in any asylum. Good night. Oh, John. Come in when you get upstairs, will you? You don't like her, hmm? Well, she's not exactly my type either. You forgot to tell me you were married. I'm not. Oh, oh, Louisa! Oh. She's my sister. Oh. I do like her. I think she's beautiful. Yeah. It runs in the family. John? Yeah? How'd you like her? John, I'm not going to hold still for it. Well, what do you mean? If I can produce a star to take Yvonne's place, I'm in again. It's all right with me when you're out. Listen, dreamboat, I'm a great director! Surely I'm entitled to my due! Not by trickery, you're not. I'm not going to let you get away with it! Louisa-- And don't act! I know all your tricks. "You must know how much this means to me. I've poured my life's blood into it. I've lived it 24 hours a day. And all night too." I wasn't gonna say anything like that. I'm not thinking of myself at all right now. Doug's on the spot. And I've just got to help him out. After all the years we've been friends, I should think you'd wanna help him out too! I do! That's why I won't let you fool him. Look, when I get through with this girl, she'll be great. Doug'll be crazy about her. She'll save the picture. The answer's still no. I haven't asked you anything! You won't tell him because I told you in confidence. Won't I? Of course not. Will you? Oh, you can't. Good old Doug. This will mean so much to him. After the way he stuck his neck out for me, I've just got to come through for him. I owe it to him, Louisa. You can see that. You do understand, don't you? Oh! Perfectly, glamor boy. And the first time you think of anybody but yourself, it'll still be the first time! Oh, all right! But just tell me whoever does think of anybody but himself. The mail, madam. Good morning. Good morning, Mary. Sleep well? Oh, gosh, yes. And as long as I wanted to. I couldn't a slept another minute. I couldn'thaveslept another minute. You too? No, you. You couldn't haveslept another minute. That's what I said. Mary, he's a purist. I thought she was going to speak French. She'll think in English. It has to be correct to translate. Poor kid. Oh, I don't mind. I'd like to be able to talk good. Coffee sure smells wonderful, don't it? Doesn'tit. Aha. Uh, you wear size 12, Mary? That's right, if you don't mean my shoes. I thought I'd pick up a few things for you. If you could go with me-- Impossible. Nicolette will be here any minute. She's late now. She has a school in Paris. She'll-- She'll teach you singing, dancing, and language. Gallic manners, customs, history, and geography. What? No algebra? If she comes from France, she has to know her background. You'll have to know where you were born, what your house, school and city looked like. Your mother's maiden name, you father's-- Uh, yes, Wilson? Pardon, sir. Got a match, bub? Madam Nicolette is here, sir. That's fine. Show her in. Very well, sir. He's not gonna be much fun. One usually doesn't joke with the servants. Okay. Remind me he's not people. Oh, John, mon cher ami. How wonderful you look! Glad to see you. And Ms. Gayle! How nice to meet all again! Hello. And this is? This is Mary O'Leary. The girl I talked to you about. So this is my pupil? No, your cousin. Cousine. Cousine. You think you could make a French girl out of me? I don't think. I know. I gave my word I will make a real mademoiselle out of you, even if I have to beat the French into you. Oh, thanks, but don't forget you're mycousine, not my stepmother! A... E... O... No, no, no, no, no, no. You have to move your lips. I. Smile. O. I. O. O. U. O. Now, like a whistle. U. U. Ooh. Allons,Mary? Mary? Come on. Now, let's come here. And you do the exercise for the glamor of your legs, to have lovely, lovely legs. And to be able to-- Yeah. You must, like, talk with your legs. Your legs... Look. Oh, God! That's what we want, de la grace. Now, you do. Now, it's your turn now. De la grace? Give me your legs. Yeah? That's fine. Now, you put your... What's happened to you? Have you slip? No, I always sit down to rest this way. No time for rest. ♪ Night sings A lonely serenade ♪ ♪ As I walk along ♪ ♪ With my kisses on parade ♪ No, no, no, no, no. More feeling! If you mean I'm numb, you're not kidding. You have been working her pretty hard, Nicolette. Why don't you sit down, Mary, and relax for a minute, hmm? What's the matter? You look as if your face hurts. It's not my face that hurts. Very, very good, Nicolette. Merci, monsieur. Now, I want you to start with theLearn About Lovenumber. The one from the picture. What? How would you like it, homogenized? All right, come on. Let's start, let's start. With emotion. Think how you are feeling! I know how I'm feeling, and it won't sound like music. Now, those are your marks. You come up to them when Bill comes in. Keep your left profile to the camera, which is right here. Okay. And this is the door. All right. Go back to the piano. Okay. Action. ♪ I want to learn About love from you ♪ Knock, knock. Entrez. He's opening the door. Oh,MonsieurBill. That is such-- Watch the marks on the floor. No, don't look at them. To the right. Little bit... Watch the marks-- Don't look at them! Well, how can I watch 'em without looking at 'em? It's impossible! The whole silly business is impossible! You expect the impossible! I can't do it, and I don't wanna do it. I'm going back to the carnival where I can get some rest. You're pretty tired, aren't you? Everything that don't hurt itches. All right, Mary. We'll quit... ...as soon as we run through the entrance scene. Come on. Over to the piano. Now, I knock, and you come to meet me. And don't forget you're in love with me. In love. Yes, John. All right. Action. ♪ I want to learn About love from you ♪ Entrez. Oh,MonsieurBill. Mademoiselle. That is such surprise. John... That's good. That's very good. But your arm was covering your face. This time, raise the arm away from the camera. So-- Well, what--? No. The lesson almost-- John. Didn't I warn you I was not going to let you browbeat her? Have I? I've been as gentle as a butterfly's burp. You've watched me for weeks. That's right. I was beginning to think you'd gone human, but you can't say she seems to be having fun. May I remind you I'm not working my brain to the bone for that girl to have fun! That's right. It was all done for Doug. To save his face with J.B. Durham, pay him back for the break he gave you. Well, regardless of your motives, ducky, the results will still be the same for Doug. That's the only reason I finally agreed to your plan. What's the matter, baby? Oh, I told her she did a fine piece of acting, and she clouds up to dampen the whole atmosphere. There, there. Have a good cry and enjoy yourself. I hate him. I hate him! Of course you do. He's so mean and hard, and selfish... and I love him. Oh, Mary, you can't love him. You mustn't. I know. I didn't mean to. I didn't want to. I didn't know it at first. And then I got to wondering why I was taking such a pushing around. And then I knew. And now it's too late. And I hate him. You think I'm a bubblehead, don't you? Naturally. Falling in love with John is like falling in love with a refrigerator, or an adding machine, or... Mary, it'll be hard for you to understand people like John and me. We're so completely self-centered that we're incapable of love. That's why neither one of us has ever married. I don't believe that. You just think so because neither one of you have met the right one. Have it your way. Just trying to let you down easily. All you've told me is that... That I have no rival. Oh, but you have. That insane desire of John's, that driving ambition to be the world's greatest director. That's right. Then, that's the way I'll get him. I'll be such a good actress that-- That he'll need me, he'll admire me first and then... Oh, John... John. I'm so glad you came back, John, I'm-- I'm all rested now, and we can go on with the lesson. Well, that's good. 'Cause up till now, I've been so proud of you. You have? Perhaps I should have told you how much I admire you. What a game little thing you've been. How clever I think you are. And... And what, John? Well, this may come as something of a shock. Yes. You're ready. You're ready to spring on the studio. You didn't expect me to say that, did you? You're so right. And I'm gonna say something that you didn't expect. Yes. Go jump in the pool! What? No, on second thought, don't. 'Cause I'm going to! Hello. Hi. You swim as though you were raised in a pool. One of these dinky things? We kids had the whole East River at the end of our block. I never even saw one of these until I came to California. Been here long? Uh-uh. But often. We get to the coast about every year this time. Your father travels? Pa? Ha, ha. The only place he ever traveled was down to the bar. He couldn't even travel back, they used to have to bring him. That's some people's idea of a good time. Sure was his. He'd rather have a beer than a license to steal. My name's Mary. What's yours? My-- Well, well, well, if it isn't Doug. Hello, Louisa. Hello. I was asking him what his name was. She was telling me about her Pa. Sure, Douglas. Douglas Hyde. Hide. These mosquitoes here. I was just telling him about Pa. You found your robe, didn't you? Of course, we should have sent it back to you, but we have been so unbelievably busy. Uh, here... Here's your robe. I'll take it and wrap it up for you. You don't have to bother. I'll just put it in the car. I was talking to Miss-- Well, where is she? Who? That girl. Uh, Mary. She's gone home, I guess. She always does. I guess she's gone home. She didn't even say goodbye. Probably in a hurry. You know how it is. Wouldn't you like something with ice? It's hot today. You look hot. That's what I said. It's hot. Hotter than most days. Come up to the house. Where does she live? Who? That girl! She's staying over, visiting some people. She's nice. We let her swim. How are things at the studio? How is J.B.? What's her name? Mary's? Mary, I guess. I mean-- Uh, John, what is it? It used to be-- I don't know her married name. She's married? Sure, ever since her wedding. I'll take a rain check on that drink. I haven't got time-- Oh, you haven't. Next time then, huh? Your car's over here. Yeah. You needn't trouble to see me to it. Thanks. Oh, it's no trouble. It's a pleasure. I'm sorry. I guess I spoiled everything. It's not your fault, Mary. How could you know it was Doug? No, no! He might have been selling magazines to put his grandfather through college. Sharp as a pillow, aren't you? Oh, behave. Both of you. But I-- There still might be a way out. Name one. Well, I was thinking-- Thinking. Some of my best friends are men, and, uh... Well, Mary was wearing a bathing suit. Bathing suit. Say... I wonder if he would know what her face looks like. Then there's still a chance? In an evening gown. Mmm, yes. Her hair piled up. Yes. After all, what have we got to lose? Night. In a different background. That's it. Let's have a party. Mmm. Not now. I was thinking-- Of course! A party for Nicolette. And her cousin. Sure. Straight from Paris. Get her a gown and everything. Pile up her hair. Lend her some jewelry. Get out invitations, order a buffet, hire music, arrange for flowers-- May I ask, what are you going to do? I'll see that Doug gets here. And I will be as French as French fries. This is too bad for me to be late. Oui,I hope I have not derangeyou. Oh, nonsense. You needed your rest. Oh, may I present Mr. Douglas Hyde, Miss Rochelle Olivia. How do you do? I do very well,merci. And how do you? Oh, I do... I mean, I'm fine, thanks, but... Haven't we met somewhere? Oh,impossible! I have never been somewhere. I mean, if I had metmonsieur, I should not have forget. Uh, Rochelle is Nicolette's cousin, straight from Paris. With all the latest songs. You will sing for us, won't you? Mais oui.IfMonsieurDoug would like to hear it. Of course he would, everybody would. Avec plaisir. Then I will sing. Lovely girl, isn't she? I'm sure I've seen her before. Must have been in Paris. She's never been out of the place. Well, I've never been in it. Ladies and gentlemen, I'd now like to present our charming guest from Paris, Miss Rochelle Olivia, who will now sing her newest song. ♪ I want to learn About love from you ♪ ♪ I do, I do, I do ♪ ♪ I want to learn What a kiss can do ♪ ♪ From you, from you From you ♪ ♪ Take me, teach me ♪ ♪ How a heart should feel ♪ ♪ When to know it's real ♪ ♪ I yearn to learn ♪ So familiar.

No. That's over and done with. Forgotten, finished and through. All right, don't fog your glasses. Besides, she'd never do it. Why? She doesn't like pictures. Her family would never let her. Never, never. What, with all that talent? She just uses it to entertain her friends like us. Too bad too. Think where that'll put you with J.B. if you could salvage the picture. Yeah...yeah, well, uh... Let's go over and talk to her. Okay. But remember... Yeah? Don't mention pictures. Don't tell me what to do. You've been getting me into trouble since we were kids. From now on, I'm gonna do things my way! Your high blood pressure. Yeah. I haven't got high blood pressure. I enjoyed your singing very much, Miss Olivia. Rochelle. Rochelle. And I enjoy singing so much for such a, how you say, hunk of man? Ahem. Shall we have a drink? Yeah. Oh, no, this is out of the question. Even thinking of it gives me the goose pimples. Yeah, but Rochelle, Doug is talking about a test. Wouldn't you like to see what you look like in pictures? Hmm.Oui. That'll be nice to send home to your family. Ah,oui.That is most interesting. This I would like. Splendid, how about tomorrow? Tomorrow? Uh... Is that a good time for you to make this teasing? Testing. Testing. Oh, John won't make it. I, uh... I have another director who-- Oh, no, that is impossible. It wouldn't make any difference, Rochelle. You want to bet? With someone else, I would be so scared that my hair would stand on their ends! No, no, no, no, no-- Wouldn't you do it for Doug? Ah, forMonsieurDoug.Oui. Withplaisir. But only if you make the test. N'est-ce pas? Mr. Gayle. Is Miss O'Leary here? In the drawing room, sir. "The house." "The little house." Bonjour.Hello. Bonjour, monsieur. Hello, mister. Hello. Blossom test was great, great! I knew it would be okay if you made it. Doug wants to sign you right away. But I refuse, huh? Definitely. This isimpossible. At first. Oh,mais oui. Gradually, you weaken. But only because you like him. Finally, you'll do it. If you direct. What if Doug won't go for that? Oh, he will, stop worrying. You sound like a grandmother. Feel as though I were. Suppose he won't bother-- Pardon, sir. For Miss O'Leary. Miss Olivia, sir. Thanks, Wilson. Must have sent it by carrier pigeon. "Will you do with the honor of dining with me tomorrow night?" I will, huh? Certainly, you're anxious to see him. Remember, you like him. I do. Well, that doesn't matter. The important thing is he thinks you do. Let's call him. Well, you like him, don't you? Of course I do. He's my best friend. I ought to take a look at my flowers, so I'd know what to thank him for. They're roses, of course. Doug has no imagination. Oh,mais oui. Thank you so much for your beautiful bouquet. And your beautiful package with the message. Thank you. Good morning, Hilda! Good morning, sir. Lovely Sunday, isn't it? Yes, sir. Miss Olivia having breakfast? No, sir. She left early this morning. For Arrowhead. It must be a lovely day there. Yeah. And with that nice Mr. Hyde. Is that you, Mary? No, it's not. These came for Mary and I want to put them in water. Aren't they beautiful? Just peachy. Her room must look like a mausoleum. What's eating you? Your plan's going like a Swiss clock, isn't it? Or a Swiss cheese. It's full of holes. What do you think she's gonna look like when the picture starts? Up until all hours, every night. Why don't you tell her to sign the contract? Tell her? I can't even catch her! Ciro's with Doug. Tennis with Doug. The Bowl with Doug! But when I kept her up teaching her something for her own good, kept falling asleep like a dormouse. Maybe she likes Doug. Well, sure she does. What are you looking so smug about? You kinda like him yourself. I always thought that, one day, you and he would-- John, you have an abundance of imagination. Maybe. I'm sorry. What for? Mary couldn't happen to a nicer guy. I wish them all kinds of luck. Oh, and John? Don't look now, but your jealousy's showing. Well! Well, Jean! I am so glad that you are still awake. Drop that phony accent! And stop that. Champagne. Champagne, that is. Well, I finally agreed to sign the contract. Finally is the word for it. But I did everything just like you told me to do. I had to be talked into it, and I was. But only if you direct the picture! What did he say to that? He's gone back to the studio to talk to J.B. Does he live there? Practically. Everything's going as you planned, isn't it? Aren't you happy? Yeah. Gay as May. Maybe you'll be able to get to bed. By the time the picture starts, you'll look like a fugitive from a dark belfry. Yeah. Doug did ask me to go to a dinner dance tomorrow. After you'd agreed to sign? You know, I don't think it's all campaign with him. I think he really likes me. You or Rochelle Olivia? Yeah. He's so handsome. And such a nice guy. I feel like a crumb fooling him. You're not fooling him! You're acting the part to convince him that you can do it. And if you come through, it will put him on top of the heap. You know, I keep telling myself that. That I'm doing it just for his own good. Oh, you do. Well, what about me? You? Why, John, I owe you everything. My first duty is to you. Duty? Hm. Well, what else do I owe you? Oh, nothing. Nothing at all. Certainly not your interest. Definitely not your time. That's for Doug. Dear old Doug, for his own good. But I who found you, educated you, who worked myself to the point of exhaustion to make you a star-- Just a minute, schmo! Let's don't get this thing tangled. Making me a star wasn't the pitch. This whole clambake was to get you back in pictures. Now that you're almost there, do I get any thanks? No! Do I get a pat on the back? Mm-mm. Just the usual stingin', that's all. You got a nice, even disposition. Always mad. Just because I wanna be with Doug, who's a nice, kind, considerate guy like you wouldn't know from, you make a noise like a jealous husband, I never-- Oh, John, you're not-- You're not j-- Point killer. Hello,oui. I think of you all the time, Doug. Have you talked to, uh,MonsieurJ.B., no? This is most unlucky. Then I cannot do this contract. You'll be talking with MonsieurJ.B. again, no? Then that make me very happy. I will wait. I don't think it'll do much good, Rochelle, but if you say so, I'll try. All right. Anything you want, darling, and-- Will you dream of me? You will? Good night, darling. Now what? I, uh, just talked to Rochelle, J.B. And she said she just won't sign unless John Gayle does the picture. You know what I toldyou before, don't you? Yes, sir. But, look, J.B., John Gayle doesn't wanna direct anymore, but he says he'll do it as a favor for us. The only favorhe can do for me is take a long walk on a short pier. Yes, sir. Rochelle is absolutely adamant, J.B. But Gayle promises to play ball with us this time, if only-- After all, he did win a few Oscars for us, didn't he? The answer is no, sir. Yes, sir. Rochelle is going back to France, J.B. She says-- I don't care what she says, I say no! Yes, sir. Listen, J.B., Rochelle is packing. Packing? Guess I'll have to handle this. Yes, sir. Sign this. Hold it! Thank you! Just one more, folks. Oh, Mr. Gayle, you're-- Oh, I'm sorry. Ah, that's it. Now, hold it! Thank you. I hope you'll be very happy here, Miss Olivia. I am hoping so too. But if I should miss my own country too much, I have here my dear friends, Doug and John. We are... How do you say... Insufferable? No, inseparable, Rochelle. But, that is what I say, no? Well, we better get you started at wardrobe. Oui. Au revoir. May I have one more picture, Mr. Gayle, please? Right there, hold it! Thanks a lot. Oh, uh, Doug, set the picture up for me at 3, will you, fellow? And send Stark to my office with those sketches. How did you wangle it? Getting Gayle on the lot again? Well, I just told J.B. that John was the only director for this picture. That is, unless he did it, I wouldn't touch the thing. What could he do? ♪ Night ♪ ♪ Sings a lonely serenade ♪ ♪ As I walk alone ♪ ♪ With my kisses on parade ♪ ♪ My lips are uninspired ♪ ♪ My arms are tired ♪ ♪ Of love's ♪ ♪ Masquerade ♪ ♪ Night ♪ ♪ Knows the way I really feel ♪ ♪ And the song will change ♪ ♪ When I meet with my ideal ♪ ♪ Until that happy day ♪ ♪ He holds me tight ♪ ♪ The night ♪ ♪ Sings a lonely ♪ ♪ Serenade ♪ ♪ Until that happy day ♪ ♪ He holds me tight ♪ ♪ The night ♪ ♪ Sings a lonely ♪ ♪ Serenade ♪ I think J.B. will like that. If the rest of scenes in the picture are as good as that, mmm! Save it, Mac. John, I'm so glad-- Oh, Jean, I am so happy that you are pleased and everything has come out just as you want. It sure has, baby. Now you get over to publicity. They're putting on a campaign that'll put you in every home... like a breakfast food. Oui. But tonight? Tonight? You know, the first day of the picture celebration-- Better tell Louisa I won't be home for dinner. - I got hours of work. - But, you-- You and I-- You and I'll be together on the whole picture. Now, be a good girl, don't hold up production. Hi. How does it feel to be all signed, sealed and delivered? Great, I guess. From Doug. Lovely. You were right about John, Louisa. My brain must be all thumbs to think that I could ever mean anything to him. Don't tell me. He's won his point, now he's giving you the quick brush-off. And I was so sure I was getting somewhere. The other night, I thought he was jealous of me. But I guess he was temperamental. Take my advice, baby, it's free and worth it. Forget John. Doug's such a sweet human guy who's crazy about you. He doesn't even know Mary O'Leary. When the time comes to tell him, he'll probably hate her. Besides, he won his point too, you know? Probably won't be calling like-- You answer it. Hello. How are you, Doug? Yes, she's here, pretty tired. Oh, not too tired for that. She'd love to. Sure. See you. You're having dinner with your producer, cherub. That guy's something you could count on beside your fingers. Yeah, he is swell. That's an understatement. He's sincere, loyal, kind, considerate, everything a woman could want. Then, uh, why don't you want him? I? Oh, I told you, the only way I'd be happy in marriage is as a widow. Probably. Go on now, put your things away, get in the hot tub and wash off that dreary expression. Yeah. I'll turn on the other drips. Evening, Wilson. Good evening, sir. Is Miss Olivia... Miss Olivia left you a note. She left a-- I'm delivering flowers. Really? I thought you'd come to trick or treat. Take those upstairs. Good night. Oh, Mr. Gayle, I presume. What a domestic item. Fire, robe and the funnies. Fancy finding you at home of an evening when you're shooting a picture. I was tired. Thought I'd get to bed for a change. Something on your mind? You should pardon the expression. No. No, I, uh... I was just... Mary upstairs? Uh-uh, she's out. With Doug, I suppose? Why not? Why not? Why do you suppose why not? She's working. She's in the middle of a picture. Hasn't she been good? Magnificent. Great. She can't keep up like this. No actress can burn the candle at both ends. Nobody can burn 'em in the middle. What a comic. While I'm devoting every waking hour to making this picture for her and Doug. Couldn't you see to it she keeps her looks? Oh, she looks fine. She only went to that big press party at the Sultan Club. Strictly business. Oh, why'd Doug have to take her? Why don't you go and find out? Me? Rot! Where are you going? To bed. Oh, uh, Rochelle, may I present Mr. Starr, Broadway's most famous-- Oh,monsieurStarr. I have heard this name before, no? You are the famous, uh, how do you say? Plagiarist. I say something wrong? You did not write these plays? You mean playwright, Rochelle. A plagiarist steals ideas. Steals? This is terrible. I hope you will forgive. Certainly, provided you do a song for us. This I will do. You are most kind to forgive. Oh, John. This is a surprise to see you at this party. Rochelle-- Now I know, you are here so these nice people can write you down in the newspapers for publicity. Ladies and gentlemen of the press, may I present Miss Rochelle Olivia, who will sing a song for us, "Let's Fall in Love." ♪ Let's fall in love ♪ ♪ Why shouldn't We fall in love? ♪ ♪ Our hearts are made of it Let's take a chance ♪ ♪ Why be afraid of it? ♪ ♪ Let's close our eyes ♪ ♪ And make our own paradise ♪ ♪ Little we know of it Still we can try ♪ ♪ To make a go of it ♪ ♪ We might have been Meant for each other ♪ ♪ To be or not to be ♪ ♪ Let our hearts discover ♪ ♪ Let's fall in love ♪ ♪ Why shouldn't We fall in love? ♪ ♪ Now is the time for it While we are young ♪ ♪ Let's fall in love ♪ ♪Cherie,let's fall ♪ ♪ In love ♪ Well, that was wonderful, Rochelle, wonderful. Yes, wonderful. I want to talk to you. Excuse me,monsieur. What do you want me to do? What do you mean "do"? Stop looking at me as if I'd set fire to my grandmother, I just want to talk to you. Who are you kidding? Since you started work on the picture, you haven't had time for a word that wasn't direction. Maybe because out of the studio, you haven't time to listen to anyone except Doug. I was supposed to make him think I liked him. Yes. "It's unimportant whether you do, make him think you do." That's what you said, isn't it? That I did. You're running it into the ground like a-- Like a subway. You've got the contract, we're doing the picture, you don't go on stringing him. Just like that? Now you got what you want, I'm to tell Doug to step in the front of a steamroller. Listen, Mary... Well, I got news for you, brother, I'm not stringing him. I like his liking me. And now that I've made him think I like him, I do. You're making Hollywood think you're in love. Well, maybe I am. Why, are you silly? You're giving yourself romantic notions you haven't time for. What do you know about love? Ah, get him. I'll tell you what I know about love. I was in love once, head over heels in love, for the first time in my life. And guess who with? You. Yeah, you. That's a laugh, isn't it? The most selfish, cold-blooded, egotistical stuffed shirt that ever put himself 6 feet above contradiction. Why, Mary, I had no idea-- You never had an idea in your life that concerned anybody but the great John Gayle. And there are a few other things that ought to be brought to your attention. You might have picked me up in a carnival, chum, but for my dough, you couldn't get a job there if a fix was in. Why, you're lower than the midgets and colder than the snake pit. Your head is so big you couldn't get it in a lion's mouth! Why, you couldn't be a real guy if-if you did imitations. I'd be back there doing exactly what I was doing if I thought there was a chump's chance of ever getting to be like you. Mary, listen to me. But I'm gonna stay me, you see. If I have to be Rochelle Olivia for the rest of my life, just don't forget that Mary O'Leary is underneath. Yeah, Mary O'Leary from the black top show of a rag trick, remember? That's who I am and that's who I'm gonna be. And if I live to be as old as an elephant, I'll never be anyone else. What a scoop! Where are the telephones? Over here, come on. Follow me. What a score! Yeah? Just heard what happened at the press party. I'm writing my resignation now, J.B. Okay. When you get it finished, file it under "Experience." - Don't you want it? - What for? You've got a picture to finish. Then you haven't heard. Rochelle isn't French, she's just-- Got somebody better for the picture? Well, no, but... It'll be all over the papers tomorrow, J.B. Thousands of dollars' worth of publicity that we don't have to pay for. Yeah. Yeah, you're right, J.B. Break Gayle's contract on fraud. Hold her to hers, and tell her we expect her on the set in the morning. Yes, sir. Where are you going? Back to the carnival. I was just writing Louisa. Oh, Doug, you just got to forgive me. I wouldn't hurt you for anything in the world. I don't believe you would, Mary. And I-I haven't really been hurt, I guess. J.B. refused to accept my resignation. He expects you on the set first thing in the morning. You mean they want me to go on with the picture? You're a great actress, Mary, and a great gal. You don't even know me. I don't-- Heh. I know that you weren't raised in a swimming pool, and that your old man was taken drunk now and then. You knew? Why didn't you tell me? Well, I... I figured you'd have more confidence this way. That's why I clipped John tonight, for making you tip your hat. Oh, Doug. Well. Clinch and fade out, hmm? Yeah. Mary's fading out. Mary? Mary. Goodbye, John. It's been weird knowing you. You don't have to tell me she can do it, Doug. I don't understand it. I know she can do better. I've seen the stuff Gayle shot. Ever since I have started directing that girl, she's so listless. So apathetic. She needs adrenaline. Maybe the kid's sick. Nonsense. The studio doctor gave her a thorough examination. Is she getting enough sleep? Those circles under her eyes... Maybe she needs more vitamins. Maybe it's psychological. I don't know. I wish I did. I thought you guys might have some ideas. Ha, I wish I did. Well, we'd better break it up. All right, let's get back to work. Look, Doug, I'm sorry, but it's getting to be quite a problem. Yes, J.B.? Just saw that last stuff shot by Whittaker, Doug. Maybe Olivia should be in a carnival. But she's trying, J.B. I know she is. I just can't put my finger on what's the matter. Well, you'd better or the finger's on you. Yes, sir. Doug. Louisa. Gee, it's good to see you. How have you been? Worried. I'm sorry to bother you when you're busy, but you're the only person besides me who understood John. Well, I have to talk to you. He's not ill? No, he hasn't slept well or eaten very much in the past weeks, but I wouldn't say he was ill. He's drinking? No more than usual. Oh, then why couldn't-- Well, for one thing... He's sorry about the trick he played on you. Oh, Louisa. Heh. He told you that and you believe him? Well, that's just it. He isn't just saying it, he means it. He's sincerely sorry. Did you ever hear of John being either sincere or sorry? No. I know it's hard to believe, but he's actually charitable and humble. Even affectionate. Has me worried to death. I can understand that. Sounds like sort of a mental disintegration. Yes, or... Or love. Love? John? You mean... Mary? Yes. I believe that John's in love with her. And unless I'm very much mistaken, Doug... Mary's in love with him. Mary. Mary. Well... No, you're not mistaken, Louisa. Not at all. I... I'm sorry, Doug. There's nothing tougher than doing a solo in a romance. Yeah. I know. You, Louisa? Well, I have to be running along, Doug. See you. Louisa. Yes, Doug? What are you doing tonight? What I've been doing for a long time, waiting for you. Yes. What is it, Doug? I think the picture's going to be all right, J.B. In fact, I think everything is. - Morning, Mr. Gayle. - Morning, Mr. Gayle. All set? Yes, sir. Camera ready? All set, John. Miss Olivia here? Yes, Mr. Gayle. She's coming down. I haven't told her yet. We're ready for rehearsal. Watch your step there. This is the "Learn About Love" number. Watch the cable here. Watch your dress. All right, let's hold the gun, everybody. All right, settle down! All right, settle down. Quiet! Await rehearsal. Stand by with playback. You fellows be quiet, will you? Come on, kids. Ready? All right, come on. All right, hit the playback. ♪ I want to learn About love from you ♪ ♪ I do, I do, I do ♪ ♪ I want to learn What a kiss can do ♪ ♪ From you, from you From you ♪ You really think this is the answer, Doug? I don't know, but at any rate, John's the man for the picture. Yeah. If he doesn't cause trouble again. He won't. He's a changed man. I've talked to him. ♪ Love, love, love From you ♪ ♪ You, you ♪ Entrez. Mademoiselle. Oh, MonsieurBill. That is such a surprise. Cut, cut! Cut it! Cut it! Cut it! Cut it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Are you paralyzed? And you're not much better. I saw the stuff they shot of you last week, and there is nothing wrong with your acting... that a miracle wouldn't cure. There's your changed man. This part calls for some emotionalism, so will you please try to act as if you're still alive? Now I'll be Bill. And if it's not too much effort, remember, you're in love with me. In love. Now go on back. Mademoiselle. Ah,MonsieurBill. That is such a surprise. Mary. John.
