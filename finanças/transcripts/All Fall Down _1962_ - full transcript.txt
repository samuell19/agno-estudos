MAN 1 [IN MIND]: It seems I've been on this crummy bus for half my life but I still think it's worth it because in a couple of minutes... Wake up, Moe, we're getting there. MAN [IN MIND]: For the first time in over a year I'm going to see my brother Berry-Berry. MAN 2: Next stop, Key Bonita, Florida. We'll have a 10 minute rest stop here. Passengers, pick up your luggage inside the terminal. [BELL RINGS] [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] What do you want? Uh, sir, I'm looking for my brother. Who's your bother happen to be? Berry-Berry Willart. I came all the way from Cleveland to help him out. Is that your brother? Yes, sir. Is he here? No. He ain't here. He's in jail, thank God. Jail? Well, what's he in jail for? Look, you go down to the Festival Bar, out on the end of the pier. Ask for a girl named Hedy. Maybe she'll tell you. Hedy? Thank you. [BAND PLAYING JAZZ MUSIC] Hi, Sweetie. You want company? [COUGHS] I want a drink. Well, I'm having a champagne cocktail. What about you, huh? MAN 1: I'll have the same. Have you lost your feeble mind? He's till got his baby teeth. Well, it ain't my job to check birth certificates. Look, I'm no lush. I just came in here looking for Hedy. What do you want with her? The man at the Tin Pot Arms Hotel said she could tell me what happened to my brother. Berry-Berry Willart. If Berry-Berry Willart was my brother I wouldn't go around bragging about it. Look, why is... Why is everyone around here so down on Berry-Berry? He's really a great guy. He's a rat. He is not a rat. Look, if you just knew him-- I'm Hedy. Oh, heh. That's why Berry-Berry's in jail. He threw me clear across the room and my head hit the corner of the television set. And I was unconscious and they had to take me to the hospital, heh in an ambulance. And the doctor had to take nine stitches in my head. Your brother ought to be in a zoo somewhere. Now you better disappear, kid. Huh? Beat it. Do you want me to lose my license? Well, what did I do? Get out now. Come on. Come on. Get out. Get out. What do you think this is, a nursery school? Out. O-U-T, out. HEDY: Hey, kid! [COUGHS] Hey. [PANTS] Hey. Listen, you tell Berry-Berry I'm not really sore. Huh? Tell him that... Ah, well, what the hell. Tell him he can come back any time he wants to. You tell him that, will you? Tell him I want him back. Okay. Now, go on, beat it before they haul me in for hustling a minor, heh. Gin. MAN [OVER DISPATCHER]: 1-8-5-1 to control one. Request make on vehicle 2-7-9-3. Something you want, boy? MAN [OVER DISPATCHER] 1-8-5-1 to control on. Yes, sir. Um, I'm looking for my brother. Yeah? Berry-Berry Willart. Ah, all right. Sit down for a moment. So you're his brother, huh? Yes, sir. Tell me? Do you go around beating up dames too? No, sir. You see, I came all the way down from Cleveland to help him out. I brought him the $200 he needs to start a shrimp boat business. You see, last summer I worked all year round in a Quick Bite Drive In. Do you have $200 on you? Yes, sir. Well, that just happens to be what we've set your brother's bail at. Two hundred dollars. MAN 1: His bail? OFFICER: Yeah. Oh. Hmm. [CLEARS THROAT] Gee. Spring him, Jess. MAN [OVER DISPATCHER] 1-8-5-2 to control one. Report suspect apprehended at corner of First and Main. Sign that. Willart, you're released from jail. Considering the nature of your offense we are acting with great leniency in giving you your freedom. Hi, Berry-Berry. Hi, kid. [CHUCKLES] Now, get out of town. And never come back. And that goes for the both of you. Did you get a return ticket home? No. I don't wanna go home, Berry-Berry. I wanna stay with you. I wanna live the way you do. Gee, kid, you can't stay with me. Ah, please, Berry-Berry? I won't be any trouble for you. I promise. I'm sorry. You got any money left? No. [HONKING] Why don't you come home with me, Berry-Berry? Yeah. No, heh. Heh. Do you think I'm gonna come back there and let old Annabel start bossing me around again? Aren't you ever gonna come home? Sure. I'll show up some time. I'll just breeze in some day and say hello. Come home for Christmas, will you, Berry-Berry? I might do that. Will you really try? Ugh. Yeah, I'll try. Hey, are you nuts? It was a ride, wasn't it? We can do better than that. What're you thinking about? Peanut butter. Peanut butter, heh? Do you still eat it? Yeah, sometimes. Why? You used to couldn't get enough of it. Remember the time Annabel couldn't find it in the kitchen and you had it upstairs in bed with you? [BOTH CHUCKLE] Ugh, you used to eat it with your fingers. Yeah, I remember. [BOTH CHUCKLE] [CAR APPROACHING] Get in, stud. Heh, oh, they ought a stock the highways with guys like you. You cow. I seen him first. WOMAN: But it's my car, though, isn't it, doll? Drive on, buck. Hey, Clint, how's this? Oh, man, this is living. [CHUCKLES] [PIANO PLAYING] Hey, Berry-Berry, don't you ever work? Yeah. I was working when I first left home. I was picking oranges. Heh. You know what I found out? What? I found out if I worked hard all day long, made good money I was too tired to go out at night and spend it. Who wants a life like that? I think working's for the birds. MAN: Good evening, Mrs. Mandel. Good evening, Tony. Mind if I kill a few minutes? MAN: Delighted to have you. Won't you have a night cap? Or brandy maybe? MANDEL: Yes, just a little, thanks. Are you leaving tonight? Yes, we're, uh, going on a cruise to the Bahamas. My husband had a thought time finding a crew today. They all want such enormous wages. It's shocking. Lady, if I had a yacht I wouldn't complain. Do you resent people with yachts, huh? No. It's just that I got an old man at home that talks about share the wealth and all that. Well, I'm perfectly willing to share any of my possessions. Perhaps you'd like to join us? You might enjoy the Bahamas. How do you know I'm not some dangerous maniac that goes around killing beautiful women like you? [CHUCKLES] In that case I won't have to take a sleeping pill tonight. Well, uh, these are the only clothes I got. I think I can find a pair of trunks that will fit you. Oh, I got another problem here. My kid brother, I gotta take care of him. I need about 50 bucks to get him home. Be down on that pier in half an hour. If you don't come I'm gonna have to have you shanghaied. Didn't I hear you say you had a husband? Oh, I do. But I don't think he'd appeal to you at all. [CHUCKLES] Berry-Berry. Are you sure they couldn't use a cabin boy or something? Take that. It'll get you home in style. Aren't you gonna need any money, Berry-Berry? I'm gonna make out. [SIGHS] Boy, I sure am gonna miss you. I'm gonna miss you too. So long, Berry-Berry. [JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS] MAN [ON TV]: Did you get that, ladies and gentlemen? And now we go back a few more years. Stay with us and see if you can "Guess that Song". [PHONE RINGS] Oh, Berry-Berry's just fine. Oh, he's just traveling [DOOR OPENS] around the country, seeing it. We couldn't be happier about it. [DOOR CLOSES] Clinton. I'll call you right back, Willidene. Clinton. My baby, heh! Hi, Annabel. Ralph. Clinton's back. Ralph, come here. Oh, I was just talking to Willidene Proctor, that pest. RALPH: Clinton She called up to check up on Berry-Berry. Clint, how are you, Clint? Hi, Ralph. Old kid, old kid, old sock, huh, heh? Come on, tell me. Tell me, how's that old brother of yours, the old rhinoceros? Yes, tell us all about Berry-Berry. Is he all right? Did he buy the shrimp boat? No, not exactly. Whoa, what do you mean? He didn't buy the boat? But that's what you went down there for, wasn't it? What happened, kid? Clinton. Nothing happened. Berry-Berry's okay. Nothing happened, that's all. I don't feel very well. You don't feel well? Clinton, what's the matter? Nothing's the matter. I just wanna go to bed. Ralph, what do you suppose it wrong? Oh, I bet he's picked up malaria or something down in those swamps. Stick out your tongue, honey. Oh, for crying out loud can't a guy just go to bed around here when he feels like it? Let him go to bed, Annabel. He'll be okay in the morning. We've got a right to know what happened, Ralph. Annabel.... A boy drives thousands miles to visit his brother then comes home and doesn't want to tell us what happened. Annabel... I intend to know what happened, Ralph. Annabel... Just let him go to bed. He's tired. He just doesn't take an interest in anything. Clinton hasn't been the same since he got back. I mean, did you have anything of this sort with Echo? Will you put your psychic powers to work on my boys and see what you can find out. Now, you tell that daughter of yours the least she can do is to pay us a visit when she comes to town. Now look, Bernice, I'm gonna be furious if she doesn't stay with us. Yeah. Look, I better hang up. Ralph gets livid when he has to pay my long distance bills. Look, take care of yourself, Bernice. Goodbye, Bernice. Are you up yet, Clinton or just dawdling? I'm dawdling. [BREATHS OUT] Sleep until noon. Make a servant of your mother. I see you've pulled your blanket out again. I couldn't sleep a wink if I thought my feet were out in the cold. [SIGHS] You think your father's going to let you get away with this? No, I don't think Ralph really cares whether I sleep with them tucked in or not. Smart. What time is it? Ugh, ten o'clock. Hmm. You said it was noon. Smart. Clinton? Hmm? Are you in secret communication with Berry-Berry? No. You wouldn't tell me even if you were. Look mister star boarder, you're not getting away with a thing. I want to see you downstairs in just a very few minutes. Ralph, you're gonna have to talk to Clinton. Yeah, what about? What about? Do you realize that boy Hmm? hasn't set his foot inside a classroom in the past two months? Maybe he doesn't like the school he has to go to. Maybe we should call the school board and ask them to start a new school just to please his majesty. Ralph, will you talk to him? I'm seriously considering sending him to some sort of a psychiatrist. To a what? ANNABEL: Some a counselor. Now you listen to me, Annabel. There is nothing wrong with Clinton. Listen, Ralph. This is very serious. And very hard to explain. You're gonna have to meet me halfway. Now all the time Clinton's not been in school do you know where he's been? He's been sitting around the Aloha Sweet Shop. [SCOFFS] And this is what he's been doing. Copying down conversations he overhears. Look. This one is marked 142. Now that means that he has filled out 141 of these things, Ralph. Now this is serious. You remember those very intelligent kids they used to have on the radio Hmm. that know the answers to all the questions? One of them got put away in a mental institution. He went around memorizing streetcar transfers. They couldn't do a thing with him. Ralph, it's not normal. Normal. Normal? Now what do you suppose Victor Hugo did when he was a boy? Or Tolstoy or Theodore Dreiser? Well, how do we know that Tolstoy was sane? Oh, now.... Or Theodore Dreiser? I mean these notebooks are an obsession. Clinton, are you up there in that bathroom? Eavesdroppers never hear anything good about themselves. [WINDOW CLOSES] Bernice told me Echo's coming to Cleveland for a convention the week before Christmas. Yeah, who's Echo? ANNABEL: Oh, Ralph, I've told you a hundred times. She's Bernice's daughter. Oh. I told her to make sure she stays with us. Oh, why with us? Now look, Ralph. You don't think I'm gonna let the daughter of my very oldest friend go down and stay in one of those hotels, do you? Where who knows what might happen to a sweet, unsuspecting young girl. Yeah, who says she's a young girl. Why, she's not a day over 30. I want to know, why does she have to stay here? CLINTON: Aren't you scared she'll get grease all over your slipcover? Isn't she some kind of an automobile mechanic or something? She's nothing of the sort. She's a receptionist in this great big insurance office in Toledo. She just happens to be clever with mechanical things. She got this big old car and taught herself to take care of it. It's sort of a hobby with with her. How did you find out about that, Clinton? Look, Bernice wrote me that in a letter. Do you read my letters too? And write it all down in that notebook of yours? What are you doing with raw cabbage and carrots? Fixing breakfast. Breakfast? I've got perfectly delicious pancakes. Oh, those soft foods don't build you up. They're no good for you. Oh, forever more. Raw cabbage and carrots. After I go through all the trouble of... Well, I don't ask to be appreciated around here. Look, Clinton. Yes, Annabel? I'll never get used to be calling Annabel by you. You know, it was never my idea, the first name thing in this family. You know, it's all part of your contempt for the family unit. You think mother's a dirty word. Oh, Annabel. No wonder everyone around here thinks we're Communists. Ah, wait a minute. Just because I happen to think that-- People around here think we're absolute freaks, Just because I hate to see people starve and you tell me-- I don't know what people say about us, Ralph. Ralph? Ralph? [BLENDER WHIRRING] Clinton, I hope you don't think every word your father says is gospel. I don't. But on the other hand you must always respect him for what he was. So don't think you can poo poo your father or be condescending about him. Oh, no, not by a long shot, Mr. 16 years old and don't you forget it. I wasn't. As he was as brilliant a man as I ever met. Before he started committing suicide. Hey, what are you talking about? It's no secret. Your father's been committing suicide for the last 30 years. Bourbon. Ever hear of it? Clinton. Families mustn't quarrel amongst themselves. About you sleeping with your feet out, for instance. That was just nervousness on my part. I mean if you're content to sleep with your feet that way it's none of my business. I admit it. Now will you sit down for a minute while I ask you something? Just between friends. No umbilical cords. Whoo, what an awful word. Clinton. Do you honestly think the only thing I care about is Mother's Day presents? Golly, how little we understand each other. Listen, baby. We have love, don't we? Now go on and eat your breakfast. Or drink it. [CHUCKLES] How does it taste? Great. Great. [**] [HORN HONKS] ANNABEL: Echo? Annabel? ANNABEL: You must be Echo. [ANNABEL AND ECHO CHUCKLING] Oh, we've been expecting you for the longest time. I didn't think you'd ever get here. But now that you are here, I couldn't be happier. When Bernice said you were gonna stay in a hotel I said I wouldn't hear of it. She's gonna stay with us. Oh, I really didn't expect. You're gonna stay here with us. Of course you are. This is Ralph. I've heard all about Ralph. You know that snapshot you sent of Ralph to Mama? She said Ralph had the most unusual shaped head. And Mama knows a lot about phrenology. ANNABEL: Oh, Bernice is psychic? Well, she said that Ralph's head shows he's just as smart as Albert Schweitzer. You know, Schweitzer, that went to Africa, with the mustache. [SPEAKS IN FRENCH] French. Did you hear that? Oh, you've made a real hit with Ralph. Have you got your bag? ECHO: Oh, I've got some bags in the trunk. RALPH : Let me take them. ECHO: Oh, I really wasn't expecting this. I almost changed my mind on the way. But now I just feel like I've known you my whole life. Oh, Ralph. Those bags are so heavy. Heavy, these bags? Lord no. What have you got in them, cotton candy? Here. [CHUCKLES] So, where's Clinton? I've heard so much about him, he's the one I'm dying to meet. He's my guy. Hi, Clint. I'm The Old Maid from Toledo. [IN MIND] You don't actually see her quiver. You just feel it. You know that inside she's all alive and quivering. [CROWD APPLAUDING] The way Echo O'Brien makes me feel is this. I like to come up beside her and just be with her. [INDISTINCT CHATTERING] Clint! Here I am. Here. Hi. Did you get tired waiting? No, no. I just got here. Oh, it's the same old pep talk we always get at the beginning of the convention. But it cheers me up somehow. Did you get the car washed? Yeah. Yeah, and I got a job too. I start work tomorrow, washing cars. Wonderful. Now you can start saving your money so we can get married. You're a good driver. You wanna know something, Clint? I can tell a lot about a man by the way he drives a car. You wanna know something else? I don't think I could ever go for a man who wasn't a good driver. You're my guy, Clint. You really are. Hey. Did we miss a turn? Oh, gee, I'm sorry. Heh, well, it's all right. Just thought you were gonna drive us off to the moon maybe. [SIGHS] Wouldn't you like to do that sometimes, Clint? Just get in a car and drive off to the moon. Leave all your worldly cares behind. MAN [ON RADIO]: This is KWFJ in Miami, Florida. Reminding you there are only seven more shopping days until Christmas. [CAR ENGINE REVS] [BELL DINGS] [MUSIC PLAYING ON CAR RADIO] Yes, ma'am. Oh, fill it up please. You want high-test. Yes. You're new here? I'm just helping out for a while. I wondered. I trade here regularly. I knew I hadn't seen you before. I think I would have remembered you if I'd seen you before. I, uh, mean you're not the kind of young man one expects to see in a job like this. Why is that? Well, if I were a young man and I were as good-looking as you I think I'd go to Hollywood. Try and get in the movies. Is that where you're headed? No. I'm going to Louisville. For my Christmas vacation. I'm a teacher. I have three weeks vacation. I'm going Louisville. I have a sister there. Heh, I hate to drive all the way to Louisville by myself. I don't suppose you know any young man who'd drive me, do you? Uh, somebody reliable? Who'd be kind of a companion too? I don't suppose you'd like to change your mind by any chance and go to Cleveland? Cleveland? I don't have any relatives in Cleveland. Well, what if this, uh, young man didn't have any, uh, bread and he couldn't afford a room? Bread? Didn't have any money. [CHUCKLES] Oh, well, teachers aren't ever rich. But I'm sure I could afford a room for him someplace. As long as my vacation lasted and provided he'd drive me back. And if he'd take me a few places in Louisville. My sister and her husband don't go out very much. And sometimes I get very lonely. You get yourself a driver. Well, you can go? Heh. Oh, my. You mean you can just, uh, pick up and leave? My goodness. You can't just go right now. And leave the station without anybody left to take care of the customers. Look. You want me or don't you? Well, I'd be delighted if you took the job. But I don't want you to inconvenience other people. [**] Gee, Echo. You've got the nicest things. Oh, thank you, Annabel. Echo, why is it a pretty girl like you has never got married? I don't know. I really don't. And you wanna know something, Annabel I would do anything for a man if I loved him. I would even go to Lapland and live in a fish barrel if he asked me to. Isn't that crazy? Well, an attractive girl like you must have had oodles of chances. Not really. You know, sometimes I think there's some sort of jinx on me. Oh, honey, you've never had a real sweetheart. ECHO: Oh, yes. Once. [INDISTINCT DIALOGUE] ANNABEL: Well, go on. Well, he and I went together ever so long. And he used to take me many places and bought me many pretty presents. And he and I had some wonderful times together. But he never wanted anything of me. What happened to him, Echo? Oh, he started drinking very hard. You wouldn't put up with that. It wasn't that. I stayed with him through all his problems. He used to have to go to the hospital sometimes and get well. And I would always go and I'd just sit there. He just liked having me there. It's crazy. How little we know about people? People we think we know very well and then something happens and we don't know them at all. What happened, Echo? Well, don't let it depress you or anything, Annabel. Because it's just water over the dam. And I... I don't think about it myself anymore. It was, uh, more than a year ago. And he locked himself in his car, in his garage. And he left the motor running. [CRYING] Damn it. I just didn't think I felt so bad about it. And I'm just silly to be crying about something that happened a whole year ago. [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] Mister, are you home? Yeah. ANNABEL: Well, you might come up here and get Echo's luggage and take it down to the car for her. Oh, and ask Ralph to come up out of the basement. Oh golly, Annabel, you treat me like I was royalty. I wish you didn't have to go, Echo. Me too. But I've stayed much longer than I intended to already. Hi, Clint. Hi. This all you got? Mm-hm. You know how I feel about that Clinton. I could just eat him up. I mean it. He's a real peach. Just you wait until you meet Berry-Berry. He's the lady killer of the family. You wanna know something? I'm gonna miss that woman. [ECHO AND ANNABEL CHUCKLING] Gee, I've had the best darn time visiting you folks. Honest, I never thought I'd find such wonderful friends. RALPH: Don't go. Heh, oh. Oh, Echo, I wish you didn't have to leave. RALPH: She's right. Will you come back soon? RALPH: Stay for Christmas. Yeah, stay for Christmas. Berry-Berry will be here then. Bernice said so. Bernice is never wrong. [**] Darn. I don't know why I always bawl every time I say goodbye to anybody. Clint, I sure wish you were going with me. Goodbye, Echo. You remember you're still my guy, hmm? [ENGINE REVS] Anything wrong? Do you want me to call the garage? [ENGINE REVS] Just a little trouble with the distributor. Bye. Merry Christmas. [INSTRUMENTAL CAROL PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS] [BELL DINGING] [ALARM WAILING] [**] Give me a bottle. Why did you have to meet me in this sordid place? You know I don't have any clothes for anything else. It makes me sick. Well... [POLICE SIREN WAILING IN DISTANCE] I called your room all afternoon. You didn't answer. Where were you? Went out for a walk. You're trying to do everything you can to cheapen me, aren't you? Why don't you shut up? You're trying to cheapen me and humiliate me. You want me to beg for you, don't you? And I won't do it. I've got some pride. I come from a very fine family. Oh, get lost, will you? Don't you talk to me like that. Where were you this afternoon? I was with another damie, the whole afternoon. We had a ball. I despise you. Really? All right. Here's the keys to your car. Where are you going? I don't know, lady. That's the God's truth, I don't know where I'm going. You are a drifter and a sponger and a parasite. Lady, that's all I'm gonna take off you. You know what I mean? I'm gonna do something I don't wanna do. Now get out of the way. Not unless you drive me back to Miami. You have to find another chump for that. Now, get out of the way. I'm not gonna let you leave me alone. Enough, lady. [YELLS] You made me do it. I didn't have any choice. You made me do it. I didn't have any choice. [YELLING INDISTINCTLY] I'm so happy. Isn't the tree perfect? I just wish Echo was gonna be here to enjoy with us. You know, Annabel, I think all this crud's gonna make everyone feel lousy. What did you say? Well, this Christmas decoration. I think this family's reached the point where Christmas will be a lot better if we didn't do so much about it. Clinton, I can't believe my ears... Do you think I want all this agony for myself? Oh, please, just forget I said anything. Oh, you think it's smart to make fun of Christmas. That's young people today, for you. No spirit. Well, I'm ashamed of you, I declare, I... What I mean is all this... Well, all this Christmas stuff just reminds us all of what a big fizzle it is without... Well, you know what I mean. Doubting Thomas. How do you know that your brother isn't speeding on his way home this very minute? Oh, Annabel. All the world is full of you doubting Thomas's, I have no patience with you. No patience at all. Here Annabell. For me? Dare I open it? You know, as a rule I wouldn't open a stick of gum till Christmas morning just don't think I can wait that long. Shall I? Here goes. What are they? CLINTON: Well, they're ballpoint pens. You're giving me six ballpoint pens? Mm-hm. I sent away to the Disabled War Veterans for them. Each one's got your name on it and I thought maybe you could use the different colors for different outfits. Well, I declare. If you haven't got the biggest darn heart in the whole wide world. That's the most thoughtful thing I've ever got. [PEOPLE SINGING INDISTINCTLY] RALPH: Gentlemen! Wait right here. Annabell. Annabell. Listen to me, Annabell on our front porch are three children of God. Orphans of misfortune whom I've invited to spend this night under our roof. Shut up. Now, you are going to stuff their gullets with about half that food that you have stashed away in there. And then we're going to put them to bed with a bottle of whiskey a piece. You keep still. Keep still. And in the morning you're gonna give them some of this this junk that you have under this Christmas tree. And if you betray mine eyelash that they're anything less than welcome in the house of Ralph Willart I will beat your rear end until it's black and blue. Yes, I will. Gentlemen, the pleasures of my humble house. These three kings will pause here tonight. And tomorrow they will continue their journey to Bethlehem. I bow to the ground, pretty lady. For the warmness of your house and heart. Won't you be seated, gentlemen. Ralph, would you excuse yourself and come and help me to make a drink for your friends? Gentlemen, excuse me. Has it never occurred to you that your own son might want to use his own room on Christmas Eve? And how many diseases do you suppose those men are carrying around with them? Berry-Berry isn't coming home to use his bed tonight or any other night. How do you know? He could-- And just because a man is jobless doesn't mean that he's got diseases. So why don't you stop being an ignoramus, and... You drink a glass of water and think about what it says in the bible. Do you dare to quote the bible to me? There was no room at the inn. Oh, you don't fool me for one minute, Ralph Willart. You don't care about those tramps out there. Why didn't you give them some money and leave them alone? Do you know how much it costs to fumigate a house? Money? Look. They don't want money. They want to spend the night in a warm house in a comfortable bed. Ralph, put those glasses back. Ralph, these glasses were a wedding gift. Please, put them back! Some good food and drink some good whiskey. So you just get those sheets and blankets and put them on those beds. And keep still. Honored guests, I would like to propose a toast. In honor of the greatest man who ever drew breath. Uh-uh-oh-oh-oh. For you. Well, here I am surrounded by one, two, three, four, five handsome men. Aren't I the luckiest stiff? Now, listen, gentlemen. We have this big old house here just going to waste so we'd just love to have you all spend the night here and enjoy Christmas dinner with us too. But only if you'd enjoy it. Isn't that what you say, Ralph? Well, I think I have here three crisp, new ten dollar bills. So you can have your choice. [CHUCKLING] [DOOR OPENS] [DOOR CLOSES] Ralph... It's never my intention to go against your wishes, but there are times when... Oh, all right. Sulk then. RALPH: Oh, Annabell, keep still. Well, I think I'm about ready for bed. It's a big day tomorrow. What do you suppose is the matter with that big rhinoceros? The least that hyena could do is drop us a card. [PHONE RINGING] RALPH: Oh, what's that telephone ringing at 4:00. ANNABEL: Very, very. I know it. Hurry up. Answer it, Ralph. All right. Give me time will you? Hello? Hello? You'll have to speak up. Who? Yeah. I'll hold on. Huh? Who do we know in Louisville? Yes. This is Ralph Willart. Who wants me? Who wants to speak to Ralph Willart? Well, put him on! Naturally, I'll pay for it! He's my son! It's Berry-Berry! Now, you keep still. I wanna hear what this is all about. Hello? Hello! Yeah. Merry Christmas to you you big guerilla! Let me talk to him! You what? He wants to talk to his mother! Listen, I can't hear you. Your mother's putting on a show for us. No. Shut up! Yeah. She's squawking her head off and doing a fanny dance. Yeah. I'll see, if I can't talk her into shutting her damn big mouth! Oh, such too language on Christmas Eve. Well, now, isn't that great. You did, huh? No, you are? He's in jail. Oh! No, no, no. I'm still here, son. Uh-huh. Yeah. Okay. Get me a pencil! There's never a pencil here when you need it. Now you tell him. They've made a mistake. All right, now. Where do I send it, son? This is not a police state. County Jail... We have a Bill of Rights and a Constitution. No one can hold a perfectly innocent young man on Christmas Eve when his mother is waiting-- You talk to him. Come on. You talk to him. Just say Merry Christmas now. He doesn't wanna hear about the Constitution. Merry Christmas, son. I knew you'd call. And I had this truly amazing letter from Bernice O'Brien. Well, you tell those policemen they can't do this to you. This is not Russia! You tell them! You know they can't hold a perfectly innocent boy. Ralph! He says he's not innocent. RALPH: Sure! That rhinoceros hasn't been innocent since the day he was born. Well, just don't you worry, son. Yes. Your father will take care of it. Yes. He'll go straight down to Western Union right now. Just don't you worry. Yes. Your brother wants to talk to you. Yeah! Hi Berry-Berry! What are you in jail for? Don't ask him too many questions, Clinton. Yeah? I don't think he did anything bad. Okay. Sure. So long Berry-Berry. Come on! Ride downtown with me. Now, you put your clothes on first, Clinton. Ralph? Ralph? I just wanna say something. And I don't want any filthy answer. I've always worshiped you for the way you are in a crisis. Always the complete master. And that's a very Christian way to be. Now, go ahead and say I'm silly. [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] Come on, Clint! You know that knucklehead's got it in his brain that Western Union is some sort of bank. And I'll tell you what he's great at. He's a colossal expert at getting money out of Western Union. You know what he went and did? Didn't tell you, huh? You know who he took a poke at? A woman. Yeah. You don't fool around that big guerilla. No siree. Some dame says something he doesn't like... Wham! Lays her out. Heh. And the old man carries the gold down to Western Union. [**] I had a letter from Bernice today. She said Echo's feeling much happier these days. You know, she feels she's got friends and a place to come to now. I'm awfully glad about it. I think she's a wonderful girl. Don't you Ralph? Mm-hm. Mm-hm! [RALPH AND CLINTON CHUCKLE] Oh, you boys. All you see is a pretty face. All right. She's pretty. But I think she's a wonderful girl too. Look at the way Clinton woofed his food down now that he's working. How'd the work go today, Mister? CLINTON: Okay. ANNABELL: Is that all you can say, "Okay"? Well, I still think you ought to go back to school like other boys. I don't care if you are a genius of some kind. I mean you belong in school. Of course, it wouldn't hurt you to go to church either. I guess that's asking too much. I don't know what you young people want today. I mean you're just stubborn. It's all that's the matter with any of you. You believe that-- No, wait a minute. What? ANNABELL: Ralph? I'm getting goose flesh. What is it? Shh. ANNABELL: Are you trying to scare me? Well, I'm a son of a sea cook. You old rhinoceros. CLINTON: Hey! Berry-Berry! BERRY-BERRY: Good. All right. I guess maybe I surprised you, huh? RALPH: Get out the old fatted calf. CLINTON: Gee, I didn't think you were ever coming back. BERRY-BERRY: Bad penny, huh? CLINTON: How'd you get here? BERRY-BERRY: What's the matter? I'm here. Aren't I? RALPH: You old rhinoceros! Wait till your mother sees you. BERRY-BERRY: What? You know, the house looks just the same. [ALL CHUCKLING] Nerves. Yeah, nerves. Terrible thing for a woman. Can't help themselves. She'll pull herself together in a few minutes. You're looking damn good, Ralph. You really look good. Yeah? Are you kidding? Yeah. Listen. Take a look. Not a blade. What does a guy need with a lot of hair. You look damn good. Ha, ha. All right. If you say so. Then I look damn good. Okay. Thank you. You look really great. All right. [ALL CHUCKLE] Who's your friend here? That little son of a gun? I don't know. Somebody left him here on the front porch. I don't even, I'm not even sure I know his name. So what's your name, kid? Huh? [ALL CHUCKLING] Hey, uh, Ralph. Listen, I'm gonna whip around the block a couple of times. Okay? Uh, just for few minutes. Yeah, sure, go ahead. Wanna come with me, kid? Yeah. Sure! Where? We go around the block a couple of times. Five minutes. Okay, Ralph? What do you keep telling me how long for? Am I asking you how long? Go on! Get out of here. Both of you! Berry-Berry! We love you! He's gone already. He's not home two minutes and he's gone already. Can't hold him here, Annabell. Can't force him to stay. What'd I do wrong this time, Ralph? It's my fault, I suppose. What'd I do wrong? I'm not quite sure I know. [**] CLINTON: Hey, what's all this, Berry-Berry? You mean you've been right here and never even called? You want one of these? Yeah. They're sweet as hell but you've got to look out for the worms. You want to know something about me, Clint? Yeah. I hate life. You do? Yeah. I hate it. You know something? I do too. I hate life something awful. [MOUTHS] Yeah. Hey, Berry-Berry? Hmm. What do we live for? BERRY-BERRY: You mean what's the point of everything? CLINTON: Yeah. Well... Maybe that's the answer. It's the only thing I could ever figure out. WOMAN: Hi, Berry. Hey. Hey. Hey. Did you bring me a present? He's cute. WOMAN: Sleep with me? BERRY-BERRY: You want her? You want her, kid? Heh. I could take it or leave it. [CHUCKLES] BERRY-BERRY: Hey, Miss. Listen. Would you do something about yourself? My name happens to be Dorothy, thank you. Well, shave your legs then. My partner, Vinnie. My partner, Clinton. Hi. Hi kid. He owns the orchard. I keep him supplied with booze and leftover broads. Hey, listen, Berry-Berry. Don't you think we ought to give Annabell a ring? You know it's been more than-- Come on. The hell with it. Look, I guess you know I hate her guts. It's mainly why I don't come around. I'm always scared I'm gonna do something rotten. I'd keep the hell away. I can find the string. I may move out of here soon. It's not the kind of place that I'm used to. Do you think I'm trapped here? Because I'm not. I wanna show you something. That's my freedom. See, any time I want to, I stick this stuff in my pocket and I take off, like a big-tailed bird. Me, I've got my freedom here, okay? Go ahead, look. See this ring? A couple of grand at least. Hey, you remember that broad in Florida? Wild things like that happen to me all the time. I don't even understand why. I don't know. Next time, I think, maybe I'll go out west. I don't know any reason why I shouldn't. Do you? I never know what I'm gonna do next. I just follow the breeze. I just live for kicks. [BERRY-BERRY CHUCKLING] Hey, look. Tell old Annabell and Ralph I'll be back soon. Maybe tomorrow or something. I've got a lot on the orchard I've gotta get out of the way. Okay. Berry? So long. So long. I'll see you Wednesday. Take it easy. Berry-Berry, will you do me a favor? Come into the house for a minute. Just for a minute. Maybe have a cup of coffee with them or something? Well, it'll give them something to talk about for the next couple of years. Would you? [CAR ENGINE STOPS] [**] I told you they'd be back! Now look, Mister-- Shh. Berry-Berry is outside and he's coming in. Now don't go making a big tailed fuss over him or everybody will just get nervous and he'll run away again. Shh. No, no, no. Sit down. Now just sit here quietly in an everyday natural kind of way and have some coffee with him. Shh. Well, if it isn't that big rhinoceros? Ha, ha. Won't you join us for a cup of coffee, Berry-Berry? I've got some pecan rolls here, if you'd like one. Good. Very good. It's my second one. Some eggs, maybe? Yeah, why not? They'd be good. Tell me, um... Berry-Berry, have you seen Herbie lately? Herbie who? Her behind! [CHUCKLES] It's an old one but you bit on it, didn't you? Ha, ha. [ALL CHUCKLING] I'm glad you laughed. [BERRY-BERRY CHUCKLES] Mister, do you wanna go upstairs and see if your girlfriend's ready? Echo? Mm-hm. Got in last night. Boy, the way that girl drives, she made it in under two hours. [ECHO AND CLINTON TALKING INDISTINCTLY] ECHO: Oh, talk about him like some Greek God off Mount Olympus or something. RALPH: Hi there, Cleopatra! Ha, ha. ANNABELL: Echo? This is Berry-Berry. Hello. Come and sit down and have some coffee with Berry-Berry. Well, you've heard us all talk about Berry-Berry-- Ahem. Would you like some coffee, Echo? Thank you. * The bear went over The mountain * * The bear went over The mountain * * To see What he could * * To see what he could see To see what he could see * BOTH: * The bear went over * * The mountain * * The bear went over The mountain * [CLINTON AND RALPH TALKING INDISTINCTLY] I forgot the potato salad. BOTH: * The bear went over The mountain * * To see what he could see * * He stuck his head in a dark hole * * He stuck his head In a dark hole * * Stuck his head In a dark hole * * To see what he... * CLINTON AND RALPH CHUCKLE] * To see what he could see * * To see what he could see * * To see what he could see * That one to Berry-Berry, wouldn't you? * He stuck his head In a dark hole * * To see what he could see * [RALPH AND CLINTON TALKING INDISTINCTLY] RALPH: Okay, on the scale, next verse. CLINTON: Okay. Come on. CLINTON AND RALPH: * He sat upon a flag pole * * He sat upon a flag pole * * He sat upon a flag pole * Now, you don't have to go making him a drunk in two rounds. Whom are you calling a drunkard, Madam? Heh. You never go anywhere without that bottle. You'd even take it to church with you, if you ever went to church. If I ever went to church, I'd have to take it with me, heh. ANNABELL: Those are awful well done. RALPH: Oh, I like them that way too. That looks awful well done. Seconds? Yeah, give it to, yeah... Mm-hm. [**] Ralph? Hmm. What do you know about that? Well, they didn't even bother to say goodbye, huh? Come here, old kiddo, son. [MUTTERING] Hey, hey, hey. I gotta talk to you. CLINTON: What about? Well, you had a bad dream, huh? CLINTON: Yeah. I want her, Clint. She wants me. I know it. What do you think? [SIGHS] What do I think? You saw her first, Clint. Yeah. But I'm 16. She's 31. Look, I won't look at her again if you don't give me the word. You love her, don't you? Don't you? Maybe. Treat her nice, will you? What do you think I'm gonna do? Well, I didn't mean anything. Thanks. Thank you. What do you got to thank me for? For telling me. Good night, kid. Good night, Berry-Berry. [DOOR CLOSES] [**] [**] Ralph, can I admit something to you? Sure. Shoot. Ralph, it hurts me to realize that Berry-Berry is in love. Why should I feel so sad? When my first born, my boy's in love. And with a perfectly wonderful girl, even though she is older than he is. I don't think it matters. It's just that... It's just that it hurts when the boy you love loves somebody else. Good morning, one and all. RALPH: Good morning, heh. How's Albert Einstein this morning? And how's Annabell? Fine, Echo. I feel so happy. Do either of you realize how happy this girl is? Do you? I am happy, happy, happy [CHUCKLES] But I can't even remember when I've been this happy before. Maybe never. And I feel a little guilty about it. Isn't that crazy? Guilty as though I didn't really have a right to be happy You do have the right, Echo. You deserve every bit of happiness you can find. Oh, what the hell. We all do. Ralph, you hit that nail right on the head. We all do. Heh. Now where's Clinton? Where's my guy this morning? Good morning. Hi. Well! Berry-Berry, I haven't seen you up this early since you were in high school. RALPH: Before breakfast? Must be love. [RALPH CHUCKLES] [CAR HORN HONKING] Hi, Echo. Hey, what are you doing here? I came by to give my guy a ride home. Really? Geez, thanks. Listen. I'll check out and I'll join you. Just a minute. I'm leaving now. MAN [OVER RADIO]: Finished that Mercury? Yeah, it's finished. Where's Berry-Berry? Oh, just because we're going together doesn't mean I don't have time for my other guys, does it? Clint, you wanna see something? CLINTON: Yeah. Wow. Isn't that the most beautiful thing you've ever seen? Berry-Berry give you that? It's the nicest present anyone ever gave me. Clint, I guess you know how I feel about him. Yeah, I guess. You wrote me a note once when I first came to visit. [CLEARS THROAT] You thought I'd forgotten, didn't you? [CHUCKLES] Well, about that note, [**] I just want you to know it goes double. I guess I was pretty crazy to think I had a chance. Just think of all the years you have ahead of you to fall in love with beautiful young girls. They'll make you lots happier than an old woman like me. Oh. Anyway, you're still my guy. [IN MIND]: Au revoir, notebook, old pal, old thing. You have had it. This is my last entry. Berry-Berry can go straight. So can I. Now look, mister, you can't study all night. I brought you a snack. Here. Thanks. Oh, we're one big happy family now, aren't we? Berry-Berry's still home. Just think of it there were times I thought I would never see him again. Has he said anything to you, Clinton, about getting married? No. You sure? Sure I'm sure. Oh, you wouldn't tell me even if he had. I'll bet anything they get married. I'll bet anything. Clinton, do you still write in those notebooks of yours? You write down the things I say, don't you? Sometimes. Well, when you read them over do I sound like a silly woman, Clinton? Gosh no, Annabell. Heh, I mean no. [WHOOPS] What's the matter, honey? Nothing. You're thinking of something. I can tell. All these people walking around, leading everyday kind of lives, guys with families and kids, you think I'm getting to be like one of them? Don't you want to? I don't know. Do you think they're happy? Well, I think they might be. [**] What's the matter? Nothing. You haven't been talking much. Well, I haven't wanted to. You happy? Yes. You sound sad like there's something wrong. There's nothing wrong, Berry-Berry. Honest. BERRY-BERRY: You sure? Honest. [**] Well, there you are. Have you had a good time? Did you go to the Ballad East room? I hear it's a wonderful place with real oriental girls to wait on you. Lord, I wish I was young and could go dancing again. I never could get Ralph to dance a step. I guess he thought dancing was capitalistic. Annabell, I think I'll go on up to bed. Oh. Oh, I was hoping you'd stay and talk for a while. Thanks for a wonderful time. Good night, Annabell. ANNABELL: Good night. Well, Berry-Berry, let's you and I have a little talk. Your father never talks to you boys, not seriously. So, as usual, it's left up to me. I think I'm going to bed in a couple of minutes, Annabel. Well, I just wanted to tell you how happy I am about you and Echo. I think it's time you were settling down. And I think Echo's just the girl to do it with. Maybe that will be the best thing for you. A woman who's a little older than you are. I'm sure there's plenty of good jobs in town for a boy like you. You know, Berry-Berry, your father has a lot just down the street a ways that I know he'd be glad to give you. Shut up! [**] RALPH: Well, you and Echo been out on the town? Have a big night? How about, uh, splitting a night cap with me, huh? No, thanks. Anything wrong? No. Then, I guess, I'll just follow Annabell to bed. BERRY-BERRY: Hi, kid. CLINTON: Hi, Berry-Berry. Where you been? Out on the town. Did you have a good time? Yeah. Did everybody stare at her? Yeah, they always do. Yeah, I don't blame them. [SIGHS] Me either. I bet Echo's a good dancer, huh? Yeah. Something wrong, Berry-Berry? I'd better go to bed. What are you doing down here? I couldn't sleep. Now don't worry about me, Berry-Berry. Go on upstairs. I'll be sleepy in a little while. Why are you pretending to be so interested in that stupid puzzle? I'll stop. Don't you have anything to say to me? No, baby, I don't. I guess I better have a drink. Would you pour me one, too, please? Whee! Straight! I wanna thank you for tonight, Lover. It was the best time I ever had. I mean it. For the first time in my life, I danced all I wanted. You know, most men wanna quit after two or three. Has that been your experience? Mm-hm. I could go on all night. Could you? Yes, I could. Berry-Berry, the reason I came downstairs was so you could all get some sleep. Now, why don't you go on upstairs, for heaven's sake. Why'd you tell me you were a virgin? Because you asked me, Honey. And I was. It just happened to be the truth. I'm not complaining about my new status. So why don't you just quit worrying about it and go on to bed. Why is it you never married anybody? I guess I'm just backward. Or never made out with anybody? You know, something tells me not to answer that question. Why? Because you might get sore. Am I right? Well, would that be so terrible, if you made me sore? I'd just rather skip it. I wanna know why! You know why. Because you never loved anybody else? You're pregnant, aren't you? Aren't you? Well, whatever or not I am, Berry-Berry, it's none of your business. Why is that? You're not ready to spring the big news now? You wanna wait for a more dramatic moment? Berry-Berry, why don't you just stop and think about what you are saying? I'm sorry. Yes, I am pregnant. [**] Now, I've got a few things I wanna say to you, handsome. You have given me all I expect from you. Do you hear? Berry-Berry, I wanna make this clear. When you and I first started seeing one another and I knew how I felt about you, I decided to take a gamble. And I did. I took a gamble that someday you would love me. And I didn't say marry, Berry-Berry, I said love. Berry-Berry, listen, I know I've lost. You are free as the day God made you, Berry-Berry. Do you hear me, Berry-Berry? You're free! Oh, God! Berry-Berry! Berry-Berry! Berry-Berry! [CAR ENGINE REVS] Berry-Berry! [PANTING] [**] [KNOCKING ON DOOR] I've gotta leave, Clint. Don't go, Echo. Clint. No, I've got to. Now, I want you to tell Annabel not to worry. And tell her I'm gonna call her tomorrow. Now, Clinton, do you wanna help downstairs with my bags? You're coming back, aren't you, Echo? You bet your boots I am, Clint. Gee, Echo, it's an awful long way to Toledo in the rain. I love to ride in the rain. I love to. [CAR ENGINE REVS] Do you wanna give your old girlfriend a kiss? Goodbye? Clint. Remember, Clint, you're still my guy. [TELEPHONE RINGING] RALPH: Hello. Yes, this is the Willart residence. ANNABELL: Who is it, Ralph? RALPH: What? ANNABELL: Ralph! RALPH: What's that? ANNABELL: What is it? Who's calling? Tell me! RALPH: What? Ralph, what's happened? Ralph? Where? MAN [ON RADIO]: About miles out on the highway, the car smashed through the fence and crashed down the embankment. It's a bad curve. I suppose the rain ruined visibility. [SIREN WAILING] No. No, never had a chance. I don't think it was an accident. She was too good a driver. I just can't believe it. Poor Bernice. She wouldn't get into an accident like that. Not that girl. What are you talking about, Ralph? Where is this rhinoceros son of ours, huh? Where is he? Now, Ralph, don't go blaming anything on Berry-Berry. What do you know about this? Huh? It was an accident, Ralph. Berry-Berry had nothing to do with it. He had something to do with it! Don't tell me he had nothing to do with it! You know what I'm beginning to think? I'm beginning to think that our son is a real rhinoceros! Stop it, Ralph! Don't stop me. He's a real killer! That's what he is! A killer! Why? We always used to worship him and think he was a holy priest or something! ANNABELL: No! No! Stop! No. No, I won't let you do it! Go away! I love him, do you hear? I love him! I don't care what he's done. I'll love him always and forever. [**] [GLASS BOTTLE TINKLES] [DOOR CREAKS] WOMAN: Come on, Dad. Look, I promise I'll come up later. Now, let me go. [WOMAN GROANING] Please. Now look, Daddy, wait. I think you're just the greatest but when you're drunk... You're hurting me! Help! [WOMAN GRUNTING] Oh, you dirty freak! All you wanna do is hurt people. That's all you wanna do. You're nothing, but a dirty freak! [WHIMPERING] Go ahead, blame me. I'm used to it. Clint, this particular case, I may not be to blame. You know, she did drive like a maniac. She always did. Maybe there was something bothering her. That's why I went down the basement to talk to her. She wouldn't say anything. It could've been an accident. Did that ever occur to anybody? You know, there are such things. When did you find out? I went back home. What for? I guess I wanted to talk to her again. Ralph told me, then kicked me out. [**] Where are you going, Clint? I'd better go home, Berry-Berry. Well, uh, you don't have to go right now, do you? I'd better, Berry-Berry. Can't you stick around have a cup of coffee or something? No, I really have to go. Clint, why were you up here waiting for me with a gun? I wanted to kill you. I'm your brother, Clint. Remember me? Old rhinoceros? She told you she was gonna have a kid. You were listening to us, weren't you? You heard us? You really do hate life, don't you, Berry-Berry? You know, when you told me that before, I went along with you, because I wanted to be just like you in every way I could. But I like life, Berry-Berry. So long, Berry-Berry. Kid. Kid.
