(slow pleasant guitar music) - [Voiceover] This ball has a chance. It's out of here. Home run, Eddie Mills. (cheers and applause) The Clippers, with the help of Mills' league-leading 21st homer, hold on to beat the Mud Hens five to three. There's a hard hit ground ball down the third base line. Diving grab by Mills. From his knees, he throws across the bag and gets Harris by the slide. What a play by Eddie Mills. (cheers and applause) Some sad news tonight out of Cooper Stadium. After last week's tragedy, Clippers star third baseman, Eddie Mills has left the team and there is no word on whether he will rejoin the Clippers at any time this season. - [Eddie] Three times two. - Six. - Three times four. - You already asked me that one. - Well, then what's the answer? - Ouch. - Sorry. Three times four? Four, three times. - I just told you. - Ten, nine, eight, seven. Eat your lunch. - You don't need to count, Dad. - Six, five, four. - Twelve. Three times four is twelve. - That is correct. Very good. Three, three times. - I'm going to miss the bus. - Okay, all right. Bye, love you. - Bye. - Oh, could you tell me what tonight is? - My night. - You're gonna hit it out of the park. - [Coach Steve] What are we gonna do? - [Kids] Win. - [Coach Steve] What's that? - [Kids] Win. - [Coach SteveI can't hear you. - [Kids] Win. - [Coach Steve] All right. Yeah. Right here, Abby. All right. - Abby? Hey, guys, Steve. Okay, Abs, here's the deal. He's working both sides of the plate. Shoulders down, nice and relaxed. Power's gonna come from your back foot, okay? Short, compact swing. Remember-- - Don't take my eye off the ball. - [Coach Steve] You're up, Abby. - Go get 'em. - [Coach Steve] Come on. You can do it. You can do it. We really need your hit, Abby. Come on. Keep your eye on the ball. - [Umpire] Strike. - [Eddie] Let's go, Abby. - [Coach Steve] Come on, Abby. - [Umpire] Strike two. (applause) - [Eddie] You can do it, Abby. - [Umpire] Strike three. You're out. - You were great out there today, honey. - I struck out twice, Dad. - Yeah, but Babe Ruth struck out-- - I'm not Babe Ruth. I strike out all the time. - Don't you remember? Babe said you gotta start from the bottom. - No. He wasn't talking about me. I can't hit at all. They lose because of me. - You tagged Matt Reed out at second. - Maybe I shouldn't play baseball. - Are you kidding? You've already got the Mills swing. - I want to try ballet, Dad. Krista does ballet. - What? - Ballet. I want to try it. It looks fun. - Fun? Baseball's fun. - Is that your truck out there? - Yep. - She needs some work. It looks like your base is caving. I'm Matt. I came from Sammy's garage off Route 33. You know it? - Nope. - Yeah. I was like second guy up at Sammy's. I needed a change, though. Man. It really is you. I mean, the guys at Sammy's said you were working here, I thought they were screwing with me. I mean, I did not believe them. - Excuse me. - I thought maybe a different Eddie Mills. Wait til I tell my old man. He's gonna want to bring me to work. Every night at dinner, we got an Eddie Mills update. Man. I was only in junior high. Who would have thought that we'd be working at a garage together? - [Abby] Ouch. That hurts, Dad. - I'm sorry. Look, look at her hair. Mine doesn't look like this. - Yes it does. It does. Actually, if you want my opinion, I think it looks better. - Dad, I look dumb. Make it right. - All right. Hold on a second here. - Everyone is gonna have their hair braided. - So are you, so are you. Just a second. Why can't you just put on a baseball cap? Why? - Because I'm going to ballet, not baseball. Do you get it? Ballet. - Abby? Hey, Steve. Let me give you a hand here, help you load up. - What's going on? - Well, you know, this whole ballet thing with Abby? She's never gonna like it. - I think probably all little girls like ballet. - No, they don't. Not really. Besides, baseball's in Abby's blood. - Abby quit baseball. - She doesn't have the mechanics yet to hit the ball consistently, but if we can encourage her to keep her head down, right on top of the ball, I think we got a player on our hands. What do you think? - I think that Abby is the only girl on a team of seven and eight year old boys who want to win the championship. Abby's never gotten a hit, Ed. Ever. - She bunted. Against Smart Mart. - Look, Ed. I'm gonna be honest here, okay? Those boys want to win and so do I. Abby doesn't have what you had and I think it's great that she's trying something else. I'm sorry. - Your boy looked pretty good out there. I like what you've done with his arm. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Did you see that curve starting? It was like right down the middle. - Yeah. We know baseball. - All right, look. I can take it from here, man. Thank you for your help. (classical piano music) - Let's go home. - It wasn't what you thought, huh? - Yeah, it's hard. We learned to spot, which is like staring at the same place and then when you turn around, you have to find the same exact place again. Krista was really good at it. I got a little dizzy though. - Well, you wouldn't have known unless you tried, right? - Yeah. I have to learn to spot before the recital. There's a recital and everything, with costumes. - I hope you remembered to bring your Yankee hat home. - It's in my bag. They said I wasn't allowed to wear it during class. - Really. (knocking) - Ed. You're eating late. Lucky for you, I just went to the store. Eggs or milk? - I borrowed one egg, one time. Okay, two maybe. - A cup of milk last week. I'm glad to help. - You working late? - Yes, I'm filling all my clients' orders for those baskets. Summer's just around the corner. Work, work, work. Ed, did you want those organizer shelves for your porch? They're so easy, you just hook them on. - I told you, Nancy. I don't need your shelves. - You can see your porch from the street. - Abby is starting ballet lessons, just a couple and I thought-- - Ballet? Oh, my gosh. That's a fantastic idea. Now, Ed, do you have all the clothes she needs? Because she'll need the leotards and the tights and the slippers. - I have all the clothes and the slippers. I was wondering if you could take her for a lesson or two. I can pick her up. - What happened to the baseball thing? - She's taking a little break, a little breather. The place is on-- - A breather? - Yes, Nancy. Even the pros sometimes take short breaks from baseball. The dance place is on Pierson and Fifth, Tuesday and Thursday. She'll have her clothes with her at school. If you could pick her up at three o'clock--? - No problem. Tuesdays and Thursdays are perfect for me. - Thank you. Oh, could you make sure she has her seat belt on? She knows, but make sure. - Everybody wears a seat belt in my car. Are you sure you don't want those organizer shelves? (dog barking) - Good morning, guys. - [Abby] Hey. - Do you still play? - No. - You know, I hear Ryan McGillian is closing in on your home run record. He already beat your RBI record. Did you know that? - No. - Yeah, he has quite a following. I mean, they're comparing him to you, which is absurd. I mean, he's great, you know, but you ... ? You getting with it? Yeah, he'll be called up anytime now. The Yankees are looking at several of the guys. The Clippers are doing real well this year, you know? They're the best farm team in the northeast. What about an after-work league, Ed? I mean, you've still got some good years in you. You ever think about joining one of those? - Hey. - Hey. - What are you doing? - Waiting for you to get home. Two for one, plus popcorn. - Let me see? - I pick The Parent Trap again. You can pick the other one. - Cool by me. How was school? - Good. Krista asked me to spend the night tonight. - That was nice of her. Are you hungry? - Her mom said okay already. - You want to sleep there? All night? - Dad, it's a sleepover. - When do you come home? - In the morning. I think. - Oh. Okay. - I'll be careful, Dad. - Okay. - I'll be careful. - [Eddie] You got your toothbrush? Your clothes for tomorrow, right? - [Abby] Yes, Dad. - [Eddie] And your pajamas, right? - Yes, Dad. - Okay. Listen, you can call me anytime. You can call me anytime, it doesn't matter, all right? I'll come pick you up. We can watch movies late night. - Krista has bunk beds. - She does? - Yeah. She said I could sleep on the top one. I mean, there's like a ladder and stuff, too. - Just be careful, okay? - I will. - Okay. - Bye. (girls giggling) - Hey, Ed. Sarah. - Oh, right. Right. - Hey, listen, thank you for this. - Oh, it's no problem. We're glad she could come over. Abby's a really good friend. Well, better go before the girls burn the house down. I'm kidding. You used to have a great sense of humor. I mean, a bit off-color but you were still funny. High school? Mr. Nelson's class, fourth period? It was right before baseball. I think you came twice the whole year. - You were in Nelson's class? - Yeah. I mean, it's been a while. I didn't really run in that crowd. I was in the back, over to the side actually. Behind Robyn. She was always so nice. She was always so nice to me. I'm sorry. You know, Abby really has her smile. Mr. Nelson is still teaching. Can you imagine? Still drawing those sentence diagrams in the shape of spaceships? (chuckling) Well, here's our number. So, call if you need anything and I'll see you tomorrow. - The bunk beds. Surely, the top one has a safety bar? - Yeah, yeah it does. - All the way across? Both sides? - Yeah. You know what? They're not really that high off the ground anyway. - Yeah well, you know. They're off the ground, so ... - Right, right. You know, if you don't want her to sleep in them, I can always put them downstairs. - No, no. It's fine. If you say it's safe and she really wants to, it's not a problem. Okay. Listen, you don't have a pool, do you? - They won't be out of my sight, okay? - [Voiceover] Tonight, another one for-- Coming down hard, 72 degrees, we've had less than a quarter of an inch of rain. Let me show you where the rain is. These storms are not severe but they are-- In Columbus-- Hey, look out. I was afraid of this-- (applause and cheers) (slow guitar music) - [Abby] Hi, Dad. - Abby. - [Abby] I'm gonna show Krista my room. - Hi, Krista. (girls giggling) How were the bunk beds? - Teardribble, the Klutzy Cupid. Now do you remember me? - You wore the pink hat with the silver bead thingys. - That matched my braces. Yeah, I got braces late. - Yeah, I remember your story. - You remember the hat. - Well, who could forget the hat? - Well, klutzy cupid paid off, so I guess the mortification was worth it. You know? Children's books and stuff? Surprised? - No, no. You were one of the smart girls. - Yeah. One of the nerdy girls. - I don't know anything about baseball. - What? Really? Really? You're kidding, right? Okay, watch this. See? This is my all-time favorite card. That is Tino Martinez. He plays for the New York Yankees, okay? - Where the hell have you been? The owner of the red Mustang came in. - I was running late. - You were supposed to be here an hour ago. - Mustang's finished. Bobby knows that. - Bobby has his own jobs. The Mustang was yours. - And I finished it. - What? You have a girlfriend, huh? Is that it? You've been sidetracked these last few weeks. I just wonder what you got going, because it's affecting your work. - Affecting my work? - You're sidetracked. - This is ridiculous. Abby left her ballet clothes at home. I dropped them by school, that's it. Okay? That's it. - Your girl is taking ballet? Eddie Mills' girl is a ballerina? (laughing) What? You practice with her? Those leaps and spins and shit? (laughing) My God. Nobody would believe it. Old hotshot Eddie Mills, twirling around and shit. (laughing) - There's a new ding in my truck. What the hell are you thinking? - That is not your truck, all right? Now, stay off my back. - I just-- - I'm out of here. - Where are we going? You know, my dad was in a major funk when you quit. Baseball season was over for him. For a lot of people here. People think you'll come back. - Try to get it close to the plate, all right? - Yellow cheese or white cheese? - [Abby] Yellow. - I was thinking we could spend the day throwing the ball around at Pebble Park. It would be fun. Get some ice cream after? - [Abby] Dad, come look. These are so good. - I brought you the recipe, Ed, and I included my easy version of my lasagna. These muffins aren't too difficult. - Did you ever have lasagna, Dad? It's so good. - Look at that pretty hair of yours. It is a rat's nest, though. It would look so nice braided. Now, for ballet, you have your ballet slippers, right? And you have leotards and tights, now do you have--? - I have one pink leotard. - Only one? Oh, that's not going to do. We'll take you shopping today and we'll get you some more, okay? And I was thinking, what about one of those skirts like that little blonde girl has? It's so dainty and nice. Any color you like. - A purple one? - Oh, purple would be very nice. Oh, Ed. This is a good idea. Why don't you peel this orange for her? You know, fruit is so important. - Can I go, Dad? - Yeah, I guess. If you want to, sure. - You want something? A leotard? (giggling) Tights? Ballet slippers? (giggling) (lawn mower rumbling) - Okay. These are all of them. It's really good. "Our Family Timeline. "Choose three pictures that "describe you and your family. "First picture, you as a baby. "Second picture, a current photo of yourself and "the third picture, create a drawing of yourself "and your family five years from now." This is a silly project. - We should have started earlier. - Okay, you start drawing, I'll go through the pictures. In five years, that would make you 12. You'll be in the seventh grade. (whistling) (giggling) - I loved that ride. - Me too. So much fun. Okay. - I'm drawing you and me. Did Mom write that? - Yeah. - It's pretty. - I never do this. I never write on the back of pictures. - We'll remember. - Matt? Help me pull. Come on. - That battery is too big for this car, Eddie. - I know. Help me pull. - Why would you put a battery that size in this car? - I didn't. - Man. This must be embarrassing. I mean, it isn't a common mistake. It's a battery. A battery like that doesn't fit in a space like that. See, Eddie? You're not a mechanic, are you? I've been trying to tell you-- - Listen. The owner of the car put this in. Now I gotta get it out. Help me pull? Okay, you aren't pulling. You aren't pulling. - [Sarah] Hi. - What? What's wrong? - Oh, oh nothing. Absolutely nothing. I'm sorry to interrupt your working but I was just over at the bakery and I'm Homeroom Mom this week. Abby told me which garage you worked at and we're ordering costumes for the girls tonight and she wanted me to check with you about-- - Can we ...? Let's move outside. Order anything. - Oh. Okay, great. Why are we over here? - It's quiet. Order whatever she wants. Really. Just as long as it's not one of those damn hats with the silver bead thingies, I'm fine. - Wow. You always succeed in making me feel like I still have braces on my teeth. - Sarah? Sarah, I was kidding. I don't even remember you with braces. We never talked in high school. - No. We didn't. You know, I just want Krista to have a good friend. Lord knows she needs it. I'm sure they both need it. That's why I'm here, okay? For the girls. I'll order the ballet costumes. Sorry for interrupting. - Sarah. (telephone ringing) - Ronnie's. Yeah. Eddie? Telefono. - This is Ed. - [Sarah] Ed? It's Sarah. - Sarah, listen. Is that Abby? - [Sarah] Yeah. I just got to school to pick Krista up and take her to dance and Abby wants to go, too. But, I wanted to check with you first. - Well, the Yankee game's on tonight, so she'll just take the bus home. - [Sarah] She wondered if you could tape it for her. - The Yankee game? The Yankees are playing the Red Sox. - [Sarah] She mentioned that. - Roger Clemens is pitching. - [Sarah] Ed? Ed? - I'm here. - [Sarah] Oh, okay. This phone just cuts out sometimes. - I'll tape it. - [Sarah] Everything okay, then? - Yes. - [Sarah] Great. Well, listen, I'll bring her home. The girls get their costumes tonight, so it will be, you know, a late practice. Invite your friends over, you know? Watch the game, drink some beer. - [Voiceover] We've got 'em, Hank. Tell us again, tonight at Yankee Stadium. Roger Clemens enjoying his first game back. Of course, he missed his last start due to stiffness in his lower back. (slow guitar music) - Hey, Tommy. - Eddie Mills. I'll be damned. It's been a long time, huh? - [Eddie] I'm ready to play ball again, Tom. - [Tommy] You're ready? The deal was you'd be back on the field in six months. It's been five years, Eddie. Five years. I've got a team of boys. Good athletes. Fast and young. - [Eddie] I hold the record. - [Tommy] Look, this better not be about no "lost youth." Don't waste my time trying to get those years back, Eddie. - You asked me for a favor. - What? - I went to school yesterday and I waited. Miss Kerry told me that she'd already gone home with Sarah Parker and Krista. - She did leave with them. I forgot. - You forgot. I waited. I was worried. She got her costume last night. - Sarah just thought it would be easier-- - It's just up the street. It's no big deal for me to do it and switching around like that is confusing for a child. - It is sort of out of Sarah's way to drop Abby off. - Yes, it is. So I can do that. It would help Sarah out. She has her hands full already with her own daughter and zero help from that no-good ex-husband of hers. Not that she needs any help from a man. (slow guitar music) (upbeat guitar music) - Hey. The team's traveling to Louisville and then to Charlotte. You warm up with them, just to get your juices flowing. Then, we might try you out next home game. You're hitting, Eddie, but don't get too comfortable. Derek's just two weeks out of high school. I haven't even made the rotation. But, great potential there, hm? - Oh, boy. (chuckling) I love this game. - Don't move. - You look pretty. - What? - You look really pretty. I like your lipstick. - Oh. Turn around. (giggling) (knocking) - We're back here. Here he comes. - What happened to your face? - How do we look? Nancy did my makeup and I did hers. - I think you look beautiful without makeup. - But don't we look fantastic? - She's seven, Nancy. She doesn't need to learn about makeup and she's not allowed to wear it. Wash your face, Abby. - But, Dad--? - On second thought, come on. Let's wash your face at home. Come on. My daughter doesn't wear makeup. And we are not rearranging our porch. Ever. (knocking) - Go away. My room is private. - Private? Don't you have math homework? - I already did it. On Nancy's computer. It's easier that way. What's that? - I strained my shoulder. - All the moms let their daughters wear makeup onstage. I'll be the only one. - For the recital, only. Look at you. - New cleats? - That's your costume, huh? Hm. What's in the box? - Ballet slippers. Nancy has to do them, though. - Do what? - Like, sew on the piece. - I can do it for you. - Nancy can do it. - I can sew. - You can't sew this. - It can't be that hard. Let's see. Very nice. - You're gonna mess it up and then I'm gonna need new ones. Are those your cleats? - Yeah, I just got 'em. - [Abby] Why? - That looks good, huh? If it's okay with you, and you care, I'm ready to play ball again. - For the Clippers? - Yeah, if it's okay with you. - You'll be on the team? - [Eddie] Yeah. - Third base? - [Eddie] I hope so. - Number four in the lineup? - [Eddie] I don't know. - You get to ride the bus and go to different cities? - You're gonna play baseball. I don't have a Clippers hat. Where do you go first? How many days again? - One week plus one day. - Eight days. - Right. - So, the next time you go, I get to go on the bus with you, right? - That's right. - Where are we now? - Right here, right here. - Three, four, five, six, seven, eight. - Yoohoo. Hi. Hey. I'd like to come see your new room. - Okay, let's go. - Will any of these do? - Wow. You've got a lot of nice luggage. - Well, everyone needs good luggage, in case. Now, this one has a lot of different compartments. This big compartment would be perfect for shoes and it has smaller compartments which you could use for makeup or whatever. - That will work great. You sure you won't be needing any of this? - Well, I may need to whisk off to somewhere exotic. (chuckling) - I promise I'll bring it back. - I'm not worried. I have your daughter. If there's anything else that you need-- - Thank you, Nancy. Thank you. - Show and Tell, last Friday of every month, which isn't this Friday, but it's the Friday after, so you might want to start thinking about something for that as soon as you can. What else am I forgetting? Did I give you her vitamins? Yes, her vitamins, great. You know about ballet? - Of course. - Of course. - Oh, for emergencies, you can call Tom's cell phone. - Yes. This is his cell phone number. I have it right here. - Great. Okay. Okay. Abs? - You ready? - I'm ready. - Watch the ball. - [Tommy] Come on, man. Get out of here. Get on the bus. Jones. Mills. - Buffalo, they have Reggie. Have you seen that guy's arm? - Yeah, he's got an arm. But, we can stay in there with a couple of dingers. Right, McGillian? - Yeah, that's right. - Isn't that right, Eddie Mills? - Yeah, that's right. - [Tommy] Mills? Get in there. Loosen that arm up. (crowd cheering) - [Eddie] Nice game, guys. Way to go. That was a hell of a match. Can I get a beer, please? Thanks. - Don't tell me you miss this. - I missed all this. - You know, you can't ignore your calling, Eddie. You tried. It didn't work. You had a blind spot in your life. You dating anybody, Eddie? - Nah. - Whoo. Look at all these women. Some beautiful women. Some nice women, too. - What about you? You seeing anybody? - Me? No. I've been real busy these days. - Excuse me. Is she there? Are you sure? Okay, could you just tell her that I'll call her tomorrow? Okay. Bye. - My mom was a good cook. - Oh, really? - Yeah, my dad says. - I'm sure she was perfect, judging from her perfect daughter. Was your mother ill? - No. She died in a car accident. I was a baby. - I'm sorry. You know she's always with you, right? - My dad gets sad. He stays in his room. - And you know that she's always with your dad, too, right? - Did your husband die? - Oh, no. I've never been married. - You haven't? Why not? - Well, a woman doesn't always have to get married. Sometimes, we're better without. - Do you have any kids? - No. - [Abby] You don't want kids? - You know, I didn't even ask you if you like blueberry pancakes. - Getting used to a bat again? You take a healthy cut. (cheers and applause) - Now, Tom. Let me hit. I can bring him in. - Let's see how you do next home game. Matthews? Bring him in. Let's go, boy. (cheering) (knocking) - Hey, Nancy. Good to see you. - Ed? - Is she here? - We weren't expecting you til this evening. I'm on my way to pick her up. - Oh, great. I'll get her. Thanks. It's not a ballet night, is it? - No. - [Sarah] Hi. How was your day? - Fine. - Good. - [Sarah] Good. - Daddy. - Oh, I missed you. You're taller. - Tell me everything. - You tell me everything. Where'd you get this? - The fair. - There was a booth at the fair. - We went on the roller coaster. Front seat. I put my hands up the whole time. - I held onto her. - Sounds fun. - Dad, you're not supposed to be home. Nancy and I are making a homecoming meal for you. See you later. - I guess we're going now. There's a home game tomorrow. I'm playing. - Good luck. - There's no roller coasters, but the games are pretty exciting. It's Free Hat Night. - Dad, let's go. Okay, so the Clippers are 15 and 6. The only team close is Toledo, right? - Right. They're 14 and 8. - Right. I can't wait to go to Toledo. We're going to kick their butts. - Yeah, we're gonna kick their butts. You better believe it. (squealing and giggling) - I figured you'd be in here. You know, there was a time I thought I'd have to kick you out so the other players could get a chance to use the facilities. Unfortunately, the cage has stood pretty idle without you. The new boys, they don't have the discipline. They won't go above and beyond what I require. Anyway, look. I'm gonna lock up. Close the door behind you. I got dinner at Matthews' house. I've got to address his swing, or lack thereof. His wife, she makes a mean meatloaf, although nobody's cooking holds a candle to Robyn's. She must have thought I had a tapeworm. Bring that bat all the way around, Eddie. - That was pretty good, huh? - Is Ryan McGillian nice? - Yeah, he's nice. - How many ribbies does he have? - Did you know that Abby made this whole meal herself? I told her what to do, but she did everything. - It's delicious. I don't know. - Pete Stewart's got a great arm, huh? - He's got an unbelievable arm and he's only 20. He's got his whole career in front of him. - Any girls on the team? - Not yet. You know what, this was wonderful but I'm beat. - Oh. We have dessert. - I think I'm going to have to pass. - Abby made it. You can't pass. - Okay, so after tomorrow's home game, we got to Indianapolis and then Toledo. - Pie. - Mmm. - Then, we come off for three days to play Buffalo and then we go to-- - Abby? Would you run and get some plates for me and some forks? And pour some milk. - Big glasses? - Sure. Abby knows a lot about baseball. She knows that Boston, Massachusetts is the home of the Red Sox and of the famous Roger Clements. - Clemens. Roger Clemens. And he is now a Yankee. - Oh, and she knows that the Yankees originated in Boston and that Babe Ruth played for the Red Sox before he went to New York. - And the Orioles before the Red Sox, but Abby knows that. - But, you know what she doesn't know? Is that Boston, Massachusetts is the home of the famous Boston Tea Party and Paul Revere and the Boston Massacre. - Baseball is history. She'll learn the rest in school. Besides, Abby knows more than most seven year olds. - Yeah, she does. And she will learn the rest in school. - [Abby] Dad, do you want milk, too? - No, thanks, honey. - She tells me that she's going around with you to a bunch of different cities on a bus? And that she's going to be part of the team, one of the boys. Ed, she needs school. She needs girlfriends who are seven years old. She needs a home. She needs stability. Surely, you know that, don't you? - I couldn't carry the plates, too. - I'll help you. - So, you got your costume, huh? - Mm-hm. - But you're going to miss the recital. Are you sure you want to miss the recital? - There's two of them. I'll be in the winter one. - You're going to miss Krista, probably, and school, too, huh? Isn't there a spelling bee coming up soon? - I don't care about the spelling bee. - Well, you should. - Besides, we're not going to be gone forever. - No. We're not going to be gone long at all. Nancy will probably rearrange the porch while I'm gone and I won't be able to find anything when I come back, but what are you gonna do? - You said I could go on the bus with you. - I know I did. - You lied. You said you never lie but you do. You said I could go with you. - Abby-- - You lied. You're a big liar. - Abby. - I'm gonna live with Nancy forever. - Wait a minute. Abby. Honey, I want you with me every minute. Abby. Please understand. I want you with me every minute of every day. But, school is important. And ... and stability. I am your father and you need to stay in school for the next two months, Abby. It's important. She needs to come home now. It's late. - She's been asleep for 20 minutes, Ed. I'll bring her home in the morning. - She sleeps at home. - Let her sleep, Ed. She wants to stay here. - No, Nancy. You want her to stay here. She belongs at home with me. (slow sentimental piano music) (knocking) - I don't think Abby's up for going to the game. - Not up for the game? I'm playing tonight. - [Nancy] I know. - It's Free Hat Night. - She doesn't want to go. It's just a game, Ed. - So what's it like out there, Eddie? It's like The Natural, isn't it? God, I love that movie. When he hits the lights? I bet you could hit the lights, make it spray everywhere. You know, my dad played in high school. His arm wasn't bad, but he was pretty slow and couldn't hit worth a damn. It wasn't for not trying, though. He worked so hard. Worked me so hard. - Nothing else exists within this fence for nine innings. Nothing. You can smell the popcorn and the hot dogs. You can hear the crowd. It's on the outside. It's got nothing to do with you. You can be whoever you want on that diamond. It doesn't matter. You just play a good game. - Well, good game.

Bus leaves tomorrow 8 AM. If you're not there, you know you can walk. - Good game. - Thanks, man. - Well, I'm out 20 bucks. To Ronnie, no less. I was sure you'd give me a homer, Eddie. - I never knew baseball was this exciting. I was dying when you got that guy out. - She was excited. Hey, well. Good game, Eddie. Good luck on the road. I'll be listening. - Thanks, man. Don't you touch my truck, all right? - You're just as good as you were in high school. - Somehow, it doesn't feel as easy though. - Yeah, well, you make it look easy. - Listen, I got to go. - Just like you make raising Abby look easy. - She won't talk to me. - You must just trust your instincts with baseball. You must be doing something right. Baseball's fun. - I thought you might want this. It was Free Hat Night tonight. All those people were wearing Clipper hats. They played, "Clipper Fans, Ring Your Bell." Everyone singing, dancing. It was kind of neat. Pete was pitching a no-hitter until the 8th inning. You believe that? Want me to show you something cool? - You don't have to feel sorry. I don't want to go with you anymore, anyway. (slow classical piano music) How do I look? - Beautiful. Fantastic. Good luck, sweetheart. (applause) (slow guitar music) (slow classical piano music) - [Voiceover] Ladies and gentlemen, the final score this evening is four to seven. The Clippers thank you for your attendance. - McGillian? Let's take a walk. - Yeah, hold up. - [Tommy] Now. - Hey. He got the call. - [Nancy] She was the best one. Once, there was a klutzy cupid named-- - Teardribble. I can read. - Okay. Read to me, then. - [Abby] Once, there was a klutzy cupid named Teardribble. - What are you doing down here? - I can't find 103.1 FM. - Oh, well. - [Voiceover] Their only true competition so far this season, but the club will now have to deal with the loss of Ryan McGillian, who was called up to the Yankees earlier this week. Who knows who the Clippers are going to have to pick up the production? One candidate would certainly be Eddie Mills, who's making a comeback for the Clippers. You might remember him from the '93 campaign. We'll see if he'll be able to keep up the pace and if he does, who knows where Mills might end up at the end of season. - What does that mean? - I'm not sure. - Where would my dad be? - I don't know. But, I think he means he'd be surprised if your dad hadn't been called up to the Majors by then. Hey, but who knows, right? Just a bunch of commentators talking shop. What do they know? Hey, you like popcorn? We can't listen to baseball without popcorn. - Okay, now you're the pitcher, see? Okay. You stand over there. You have to get it between here and here. Throw it over the plate. You can throw it underhand if you need to. Or overhand. Hold on. Okay. You want to take the ball, follow through and bring your leg up, okay? A little out. - [Sarah] Keep trying, Abby. - All right, Abby. Good job, Krista. - Could you do that again, Krista? (telephone ringing) - Hello? Oh, hi, Ed. She's fantastic. Guess what? 100% on her math test. - Tell him I hit the ball. - What? - Tell him I hit it. - Yes, and she was playing baseball with Krista and she hit the ball. - Four times. - Yes, yes she hit it. She hit it four times. - [Eddie] All right, Abby. - Now be really careful, because this roof breaks easily, okay? - You remember all the steps we took? You're going to have a fantastic Show and Tell. Everyone's going to want to know how you made this beautiful house, so here's some directions in case anyone needs them. Okay? The other moms or Miss Kerry, even. Do you have everything you need? - I'm ready to talk to my dad, now. - Oh, I think that's nice, honey, but we don't have any way of getting hold of him right now. - Tom's cell phone. - That's just for emergencies. Your dad's probably in a practice, anyway. He'll call you tonight. What do you need? - I want to talk to him now. - I'm sorry, honey. Let's go to school and tonight will be here before you know it. Show and Tell's gonna be so much fun. - If my dad calls, ask him to come home tomorrow morning, before his game in Toledo. - Toledo isn't that close, sweetie. - So, when me and my brother, Zack, go to the pond, we're usually there all day. Mom calls us forever. She gets mad because we say that we'll get home earlier. She says she won't let us go again, but she always lets us. I caught four fish last weekend. My brother only caught two, a big one and a little one. So, like, one and a half. I caught four. - My dad is a baseball player. He plays ball for the Clippers but, he's gonna be a Yankee. (children chattering excitedly) - Well, I knew our gingerbread house would be a hit. Oh. I brought you a recipe card. It's not too difficult. - Roger Clemens pitched the New York Yankees to another victory today. Clemens pitched seven innings of two-hit baseball and Derek Jeter-- - Yo, Ed? What are you drinking? - I'm okay, thanks. - Come on man, we're celebrating. - No, no. I'm okay. - Bobby tells her she's a good girl when she cleans her plate. I've told him over and over again, she's going to be an overeater if she thinks she's only a good girl when she cleans her plate. - That makes sense. - No. I think it's okay in some circumstances. Like we do. We emphasize that she's a good girl if she finishes all her vegetables. She hates vegetables. - Except, if you have to force a kid to eat, they'll start thinking that they have to eat on a schedule, instead of just when they're hungry. - She won't eat all day if I don't force her to. - Oh, she'll eat. When she's hungry, she'll eat. It's like sleep. When she's tired, she'll sleep and not until then. - Ain't that the truth? - Sounds like a full-time job. - Oh, it is. Yes. - It's a great full-time job. - Okay, here you go. - I don't feel good. - You don't feel well. You don't feel hot. - I don't feel good. - Heartache is worse than the flu. Let's buckle you up again. - You didn't pull on it. You have to check. - Oh, it clicked. - I know it clicked, but you still have to pull and check. - Okay. - My mom's seat belt didn't work. My dad checks. He makes everyone check. - I'll check it from now on. - I won't tell him. - [Nancy] Thank you. - [Abby] What time is it? - [Nancy] It's almost nine o'clock. - My dad's practice is at ten o'clock. - What time's the game? - Five-thirty. - [Nancy] Well, I certainly hope it's Free Hat Night or Free Shirt Night or something. - Eddie? Eddie, a Yankee suit wants to meet with you after the game. Brosius strained his arm last night. The Yankees need a back-up, just in case. A third baseman who can hit. (laughing) - Hi, everybody. This is Terry Smith from Skeldon Stadium in Toledo, where tonight the Clippers get ready to take on the Toledo Mud Hens for the first time in the 2000 season. These two teams battled each other down the stretch a year ago. The Clippers had to win the final three games in the '99 season. - You feeling good? - Yeah. - How you feeling? You feeling good? - It still smells like it did five years ago. You think they would have done something about that. - Look, Eddie. You play a great game tonight and you hit like the last time you were here. You remember that game? - Yeah, I remember. - Okay, go get 'em, Eddie. Go get 'em. - - [Voiceover] Coming to the plate for Columbus, the third baseman, number three, Eddie Mills. (crowd cheering) (slow sentimental music) (breathing deeply) - Anytime you're ready. - All right, all right. - Go, Ed. - Go, Daddy. Go get 'em. Whoo. (crowd cheering) - [Tommy] Eddie? This is Brian Hall. Brian's with the Yankees. - Good to meet you. - And you. Eddie, we lost a player due to injury. We're going to need you on the field tomorrow night. You're booked on the red-eye to New York. Game time is 7 p.m. There'll be a Yankee uniform waiting for you in the locker room. Be on the field, five o'clock, ready to play ball. - I hope you didn't miss too much at school today. We have a long drive ahead of us, Abby. We definitely should go. - Daddy. - Abby. Oh, God, I missed you so much. - You were amazing, Dad. Crack. - He was pitching inside. - Let's just you and me ride home in the back seat, okay? - Well, now, let me see. You must be the famous Abby Mills. I'm Coach Tom Donner. - Hi. You know, I believe you've got the look of a ballplayer, just like your dad, who got the opportunity of a lifetime tonight. Your dad is going to be playing ball at Yankee Stadium tomorrow. - Wow. Could you still ride home with us? - We don't put them in bowls. - What do you put them in? - We just eat off the floor. - Abby? We don't eat off the floor. Abby, are you hot? - No. Are you? - You're letting in the bugs. - [Abby] It's baseball. We have to let the night air in. (telephone ringing) - Hello? Yes, just a minute. It's for you. - Hello? - [Eddie] Hey Abster. - Dad. Where are you? - [Eddie] I'm in the dugout. I'm on Jeter's cell phone. - No way. - [Eddie] Way. - Nancy forgot to get peanuts. She doesn't know how to keep score or anything. She doesn't know anything-- - [Eddie] Abby. Baby, I gotta go. I'm going in, I'm going in. I'm playing for you. - Dad? Dad? - [Voiceover] Eddie Mills coming in now for Scott Brosius. Looks like Brosius is in need of a break after the strain on his arm from last night's game. - Oh. Ed. You're here. Ed, I've never raised a child. I don't know what to do for her when she's upset. If you should need anything, I'll just be next door. (clearing throat) - Dad. - Hey. Hi, baby. - You played ball for the Yankees. - I warmed up Paul O'Neill's arm. - And you talked on Jeter's cell phone. - And I threw the ball to Tino for the first out. - I cried. You played three innings for the Yankees. - Yep. Scott Brosius' arm isn't as bad as we thought. - So, you'll play in Durham tonight with the Clippers. Nancy didn't do anything right. She doesn't get it. I'm not going to stay with Nancy anymore. I want to stay in my own house, in my own room from now on. - Hey. Weight room locked? - I don't know. - Don't be discouraged, Eddie. You knew Brosius was going back into the game. Look, I want you in the game six days a week. Five days on weights. We got 55 games left in the next two months. I want you to eat, sleep, breathe baseball. Next time, you'll stay up. Full-time Yankee. Hm? You know, some guys, they spend their one game with the Yankees on the bench. But you? You played in the Bigs. Come on, Eddie. You coming? - You make Yankees out of Clippers. You're the coach that makes the difference. For all of us. I love baseball. But, sometimes, it's from the bench that you get the best view. Besides, my daughter and I can't both be in the spotlight. She's becoming a hell of a dancer. Hell of an athlete, if you ask me. (sentimental guitar music) (knocking) - Ed. - I thought I'd return these and let you know that Abby wants one of those hats. - She does? - Yep. With the silver thingies. I told her only the cool people wear them, so naturally she has to have one. - I feel like all I do is start over. Would you like to start over? - Yeah. Yeah. Baseball game is a good place to start.
