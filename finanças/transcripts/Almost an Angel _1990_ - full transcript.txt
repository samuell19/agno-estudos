- Try it now, Tom. Terry, you are a genius. Yeah... Thats why I'm in here. Um... Hey Tom, he a trustee? Trustee? (laughs) I trust him as far as I can throw him. That's Terry Dean. He could get in and out of Fort Knox if he wanted to. Last days, Terry. Got a big job lined up next week? No Guido, I've done my last break and enter. Are you crazy? You're the best bust-out artist in the business. True... but it's just getting too hard. Come on... Everybody knows there aint a lock you can't crack. Yeah, everybody knows. That's the problem. As soon as someone cracks a tricky security system, they bust me. No, I've gotta find a new career. Stick ups... Banks... you should hold up banks. If I was a regular-looking armed raider like you, I'd still be out. - Hey, we're missing Santa Barbara! - Nah, take it to the chapel. Yeah! You see, with me... being such a striking individual, so to speak... Everytime I pulled a job, some teller would pick me out, in a line up. GUIDO: Ha-ha! You know, we should switch trades. You hold up banks, and I'll go in on second-storey busts. - You? - Yeah. - You gonna climb up buildings and slip in windows? - Yeah. Bubba, you can't climb up to the top bunk. Can, too. There ain't no reason to climb up to the top bunk. There ain't nothing up there, but you. Oh Bubba, you really know how to hurt a guy. Oh, Terry! Hah hah hah! Alright, sir... change of a 100. That's 20, 40, 60, 70, 80, 85... 90, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100. - Thank you. - Thank you. ♪ To all the girls I've hmm before ♪ ♪ Mmm Mmm because ♪ Good luck, Willie. ♪ To all the girls I've loved hmm before ♪ Howdy. Howdy partner. This here's a stickup. ♪ To all-- To all the girls I've loved before ♪ [TV] I'm sorry, Fonz. I didn't see it. [TV] Alright, alright, lets get down to cases. That's all we got. Could you at least give us a height estimate, build? I told you. I dont know. When a big star like Willie Nelson... ...comes up to your window and puts a gun to your face... uhhh... you'd get confused, too. I got a good a really good look at him. Oh, yeah? Well, I didn't like his last album very much. He doesn't like love songs. Pretty good, if you like love songs. Well, it's not-- You talking about Willie Nelson the country singer? Yeah, yeah. Who else do you think that is? But why would Willie Nelson rob a bank? Well that's it... if you heard the album. - That's not fair. Come on-- - No, he gets away from his-- Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I thought his last album was pretty dang good. Don't touch him, call an ambulance! I didn't see him. He came out of nowhere! He saved my baby's life! He's a hero. This man is a saint. Who is he? I thought he was asleep. I was just covering him up. I didn't know about any possible complications. - His chart doesn't say anything-- - It's a bit late to start panicking, nurse. This man is dead. (echoes) dead... dead... dead... I checked him at 6:30. He was fine. It's not your fault. These things happen. He probably died a few minutes after your rounds. By the feel of him, he's been dead for hours. (echoes) dead for hours... dead for hours... dead for hours... [TV] You wanted the truth. I'm giving it to you. [TV] I'm an angel. (echoes) I'm an angel.... I'm an angel.... I'm dead, aren't I? Were the hell am I? Are you God? You're not a religious man, are you, Mr. Dean? No, but... I did plan to get very religious... ...just before I died. - You know, just in case? - Yes. - Left it a bit late, didn't I? - Mmm... Let me put it in language you'll understand. You're on probation, Mr. Dean. Think of me as your Probation Officer. Probation Officer. Sure. I've been through your sheet... Mr. Dean. You have a criminal record that started when you were 9 years old. Yeah... ...well, I dont suppose I can lie to you, sir. You can try. You're almost a mystery. In your entire life, you did nothing, but take. Yet, in the end, you gave the noblest gift. You gave your life for another being. Well, it... seemed like the right thing to do at the time. Rubbish! It was instinct! You'd have time to think, you wouldn't have done it. Nevertheless... ...your intinct has... earned you another chance. Probation... Mr. Dean. How does that work? You will go back, dedicate yourself to helping others. Giving, not taking. You will become an Angel of Mercy. An angel? Me? Probationary. Strictly on a trial basis. You will not speak of this incident to anyone. Your Honor, Does this happen all the time when people get sent back to help out? From time to time, worthy people are chosen, to be Angels of Mercy. - But these are difficult times, Mr. Dean. In this century, you're the first Scumbag we've sent back. Scumbag? That's a bit much, isn't it? Scumbag? Hey Pop! Was anyone in here just now? Only Death, my boy. Only Death. That explains it... I'm in the nut ward. (radio playing loud music) (music stops) Nobody move! Get your hands up were I can see them! You people! Get down on the floor... now. I said now. Fill the bag. The bag, stupid! Look it's... it's Rod Stewart. Rod... (whispers) Rod! Sign this... "To Nancy with love." Rod put "To Janet, last night was great." (alarm) Lets go! Walk out this door, and you're dead! Just stay calm. Nobody move. (motor stops) (restarting engine) - He's running! - He's running! I put three holes in him and he's running! I couldn't have missed him! How did he miss? How did he miss? - I shot him. - You didn't miss. I knew you'd flip out if anything went wrong so I loaded your gun with blanks. - Blanks? .44 Magnum, 6-inch barrel. Couldn't have missed. It should have blown my head off. Couldn't have missed. Didn't miss. Passed right through me. I'm an angel. Jesus Christ! I'm an angel. Sorry. I'm an angel... You can't kill an angel. Fly. Aerobics. You know, like uh... Jane Fonda. Holy water, right? This proves I'm not a vampire. Did you think you were, my son? Oh no, I saw that holy water trick on uh, "Son of Dracula". No, I've got a... I got a... real life problem... Father. Ah! Come along with me. We'll talk it over. (Loud) Well, I've been up all night-- (echoes) (whispers) I've been up all night... talking to... your boss. And checking out your book. I couldn't find any answers in there, so I thought... ...the best way to get the inside data... ...was to ask one of you Holy Joe's. - That's why us Holy Joe's are here. - Good. Do you know about... angels? I dont mean the ones with the long white dresses and the wings. I mean like Angels of Mercy. You know, the ones that come back to earth and do good deeds and stuff. You've been visited by one of those angels, right? Nah. I'm not supposed to tell you this, but... ...as you know about angels, I guess it's ok. I am one. You're an angel? Well... almost. I'm on probation. I'm bullet proof, but I can't fly yet. God... didn't choose you... to save the world from... evil politicians, did he? Nah. - Ahh. - No, to... To help the needy... ...and to give instead of taking. Same as your caper, right? - Right. Problem is, um... I'm not really cut out to be a bible basher. Oh, you don't have to be a preacher to serve the Lord, my son. You see, we're all given different gifts. Use those gifts in Gods name, even if your gift is that of a... simple carpenter. It's all there. - Ok, but where do I start? - Well... Oh, helping the needy. Well, they're not hard to find. Look around. Oh, I'm sure that... that God will give you a sign. God give you a sign to get into this, uh, racket? I believe... God... called me to do His work. God spoke to you? I believe He did. Hey... don't you reckon He looks just like Charlton Heston? - For the needy, Father. - Oh I'm sure the needy will appreciate it. Oh, just one thing... I wouldn't go telling anyone you're an angel. That's exactly what our boss said. No sweat. Please... don't let him try to fly off the top of a building. (Yea Though I Walk Through The Valley Of Death...) Psalms of David, right? (Cause I'm The Meanest Son Of A Bitch In The Whole Valley) MAN: Hey, buddy. You got a few dollars for some food? You mean drugs, don't you, pal? This is America, people don't beg for food. Where have you been the last few years? Yeah... "Fed the starving multitudes." Fed 'em on "loaves and fishes"... Hmm... Bread and fishes... Do as I say... ...no-one gets hurt. I'll have 200 Tuna-on-a-Roll to go. Paper or plastic? Ahh... I hate it when they ask you that. In what everyone assumed was a PR excercise... the Bonzo's Burger man cruised the downtown area last night distributing samples of his products to the homeless. It now appears he obtained his samples at gunpoint. But, thanks to an accurate description of the hold-up man, Police expect an early arrest. He's medium height, medium build, and looks like this... This is Cindy Miamoto for Channel 8 News. "Thou shall not steal." You know the Ten Commandments? - You're not going to preach at me, are you honey? - Oh no. I was just wondering... ...do you think they might be flexible? You know like... for a worthy cause? Well... there's one commandment that would be flexible as far as I know. That would be the one about adultery. FATHER's Voice: "I'm sure God will give you a sign." Moses. A sign? Moses... Moses. "Moses shall lead them out of the wilderness." (Truck blows horn) Hold it. - Hey man, what's your problem? You got some death wish or something? Calm down. - I need a lift to wherever you're going. - No. - 200 bucks? - Hey, come on my man. Right this way. End of the line, cuz. Take it easy now, alright? Thanks, Joe. - Yes, sir. - Draught, thanks. Hey! - Sorry, Steve. - Clumsy fool. Come on! I didn't see you. Dont mind him. Just sometimes he gets a chip on his shoulder. Where I come from someone would soon knock it off. Yeah, but he's a cripple. His being a cripple is a bit like being a dwarf. How's that? A guy I knew, Tiny Hollis. This high, shot three people, Cause they treated him like a dwarf, instead of a man with some short legs. You gonna move? Are you rude to everyone who's not stuck in a chair? No. But if you were stuck in this chair... I'd punch your lights out. Hmm. That sounds fair. Chair. - Come on. - Hey... take it easy. Hey, I dont need any help on this. Hey, that's enough. No... ...let him go. Let him go. I started it. Hey, come on, Steve. You're a cripple. Yeah... and everybody could see that. What about you, mister? You're not blind. What do you see? I see a man in a wheelchair. Acting like a jerk in a wheelchair. - Jerk in a wheelchair? - Mm-hmm. - Can I buy you a beer? - Nah, but I'd love a scotch. Steve Garner... ...professional jerk. Terry Dean... part-time jerk. Hey, Terry, so where you staying tonight anyway, huh? I thought I'd check out the motel I saw down the corner. Nah, nah... you're staying at my place tonight. - and don't argue with no poor cripple. - Aww. Okay, but don't worry, 'cause you don't see a cripple here, do you? STEVE: Just a man who happens to be in a wheelchair. TERRY: Make that a pig in a wheelchair. (Steve laughs) - Which way? - This way. Follow. Hey, I don't need any help. I'm as strong as a bull. I know that. I was just helping you balance. That's what I like about you, Terry. You're such an asshole. Oh. Thanks. You don't live by yourself, do you? Nah, not since these, uh... legs gave in, I had to move back home. My mom and my sister, they live in the main house, but I got my own spare room in the back. it's my own pad and everything. You'll be okay. What did you do before this happened? I drove a truck... Stole a few bases... And... I chased a lot of girls. - You got a girl now? - Nah, not lately. I don't know. There's something about me that's putting them off. Do you think it's my haircut? Nah... Nah. More likely... (sniffs) it's your deodorant. (Steve laughs) Are you kidding? Women go crazy over this stuff. - They do! It said so on TV. - Well then, they must be right. Come on, Steve. You met him in a bar. Anytime your friends from the city visit, they're perfectly welcome to stay here. Mom, we're not talking about some old buddy from high school. Yeah, you're right, sis. I had so many old buddies dropping by lately... - ...I lost track, - That's not the point, Steve. It's not like you and it's not right... ...to bring home a complete stranger in the middle of the night like that. Terry is not just some drifter, Rose. I mean like, the guy's got money... ...he lives in LA. He's got a house in L.A... a big house. - He's just on vacation. - I saw him reading the bible, earlier. Anyone who starts the day with The Good Book can't be too far off the track. An axe murderer can read. (knock on door) - Hello? - Just in time. Sit down, Terry. - Thank you. Got to feed the body, well as the soul. You won me, Mrs. Garner. So... you have family living in L.A., Mr. Dean? No, uh... not living. They're all dead. I'm sorry. I killed them with an axe. Look, I'm sorry. But, uh... It's perfectly normal for you to wonder what I'm doing here in your house. It's just I was planning an easy, wandering vacation anywhere away from the city and uh... ...I went into a bar and some... ...ugly jerk picked a fight with me. Steve came to my rescue. Here I am. No, he ca-- he came to my rescue. I'm just returning the favor. The guy was a jerk, but whe was not ugly. And what is it you're vacationing from, Mr. Dean? Oh... claustrophobia, mostly. Well, I work in electronics. - Really--? - Pass the sugar... please, Rose? You know, we've got broken video games down at the Rec Center. Maybe if you've got some spare time you could come down and have a look at them. Hey Rose, the man is on vacation... right? - You and that damn Rec Center. - Alright, it's ok. - Does this Rec Center got anything to do with... the needy? - It certainly does. Rose and Steve run it. If it wasn't for them, the kids would be out on the street. Doing drugs, drive-by shootings-- Ma... this is Fillmore, We don't even have walk-by shootings. What we do have is a lot of latch-key kids in the area. The Center's the only place they have to go... ...'til their parents get home. - In that case, I'd be delighted to help. - Thank you. Thank Moses. - You know, those video games are in bad shape... Pretty complicated. No problem. They used to say about me that I could eat batteries and shi-- Shoot out electricity. More coffee, Mr. Dean? [Girl] Video's on! [Boy] Alright! [Girl] Why? - Hey, you want to play doubles or...? - Yeah. - You'll be 1st player. - Ok. That's amazing! You know, these machines were donated to us because they've just about had it. That's true. Well... I guess you are what you said you were. - Yep. Can I apologize and start over? - Thanks. - My pleasure. Just, uh, using my gift to help the needy. - Anything else I can do?. - Yeah! You can teach these kids how to box. I know you can do that. Why not. Well, he seems alright... but he does talk kinda wierd. - Yeah, he was born in Australia. - I didn't mean the accent. Never mind. - I wanna play. - Hey... I'm next. Hand speed, boys. Very important to you in life. When I was your age, my hands were so fast... I could steal your socks, without taking your shoes off. Now, the left hook. Very important when you throw the left hook... keep that elbow up high. Know why? Because if you miss with the glove, You can still take 'em out with the elbow. I'll tell you what, an elbow will open up an eyebrow better than any glove. I-- The reason I'm telling you boys this... 'cause that's the kind of tricks that dirty fighters get up to. Now, I never ever wanna see any of you guys doing any of this dirty stuff. Okay, come here and help me with the bag. Put your hands down. First rule... never trust anybody. - You sure that's him, Father? - That's my angel, alright. It doesn't add up. This much cash usually means a drug deal. - That doesn't go with Dean at all. - Then... he isn't a crook? Is the pope Catholic? Uh, um, no offense, Father. Dean is a born thief. An old fashion pro, if you will. Too much pride in his trade to get involved in drugs. He specializes in security systems. Safes, banks, uh-- Hey, Bill! What was the take on that state bank? The Willie Nelson job. They estimated 67,000. 62,000? He took a wad out. I think we can cancel APB on Willie Nelson. - Hey kid. - Yeah? What do those guys want? Oh, they're just asking about the place. - You know, how many kids come here, stuff like that. - Huh. Gotta run. Hi Steve. Who's this guy? - He's got cash. - Check it out. Let me guess, boys... Social workers, right? Yeah, and what's it to you...? Popeye. Free samples to start the ball rolling, eh? And dont move... or I'll have to hurt you real bad. - What we do, call the cops? - We can't call the cops. We'll call the family. Cover me. Trust me. What? No no, Vinny. No... We cant waste 'em. We've got orders. If they move, you can shoot 'em in the legs. You know you enjoy that. Just the legs, Vinny. Guido. Yeah, we got 'em. No, they're not Carlotti family. I knew the Carlotti's wouldn't come into our territory. - They're like a couple of small-time freelance punks to me. What do we do with 'em? Mad Vinny wants to waste them. Check with the Consigliere. We'll all stand by. No, Tony. Trigger happy. Grazie. Ciao. Vinny! Good, good. Lucky day, paisanos. - Get up! - I've seen you before, I know you. - Shut up and listen. - Watch it. On my signal, You walk back to your car. Walk calmly, keep your hands in plain sight. Drive out of town. Never come back. Have a nice day. Oh... That's yours. Ah. No, it's not ours. - We-- We dont need it. - Suit yourself. Don't even look at it. - I could have grabbed the gun. - Dummy, that's what they want you to do. There's like a dozen scope sights on us, right now. I could feel it. Oh shit, you know this guy from somewhere? County Jail. He used to run with real heavyweights. - You mean like hitmen mafia-like shit? - Yeah. He's name's Dean... something Dean. - Dean, Dean, that doesn't sound Italian. - No? So what's Dean Martin, Polish? Oh yeah, yeah. The guy at the Bus Stop. Ah, ah, the truck across the street. - The car... ...get in the car. Just get in the car. Keep your hands up. Up! - Okay. - Hurry. - Alright! Get in! Heh heh. Run, you dogs. Hey, they're going to have to take their pants straight to the laundry, after this. Me, too... ...I think. How did you know how to handle it? Oh, I... saw that in the Godfather movie. Hey, bullshit, Terry. I trusted you, trust me. Yeah... I owe you that. You spend enough time in the sewer. you get to recognize the other rats. I did time with scum like that... A lot of time. Anyway, that's all in the past. You religious, Steve? You know about... God and angels ...and miracles and stuff? Ah, yeah, I think I've prayed for my share of miracles and stuff. Well I got one, a miracle. God gave me another chance. Brought me back to life. So, that's it. You're a born-again Christian? You know about that? I mean, born again? Jesus Chr-- Sorry. A priest knew about that, too. You religious people know how to keep a secret. The part with the gun. Back there. Offering it back to them, that was pushing it a bit. Yeah, but did you notice? I kept meself between you and them. Yeah, but, they could have shot you! If you know all about me being born again as a you-know-what, You must know I'm bullet proof. Of course, and can you leap over tall buildings in a single bound? Fly? Not yet. Well... for a devout Christian, you throw a pretty mean punch. Ah yeah... but that's allowed. In the bible where Jesus found all those dealers on the steps. He said, "Cast them down." You know, belt the shit out of 'em. Monica and Daphne stay outta the fridge! What are you two up to? We were just having a bible discussion. Oh, great! Good practice for the cocktail party tonight at the Bealemans. Oh terrific, an evening of grovelling with ol' bible-thumping Bealeman. Oh, come on. They're alright. Besides, if they don't help us out, this place is history. We're broke, remember? Oh God... all I can do is sit there, trying to looking tragic. Why don't you ask Terry, here? I mean, if the conversation turns religious... ...it could realy open their eyes with some of his interpretations. I think we've taken enough control over Terry's life. - No. If I can help, I'd be delighted. And if it involves a free drink and the... company of a good-looking woman, then, that's a bonus. So, don't worry, I scrub up okay. Thanks. My pleasure. - Rose doesn't have a man? -Ah, Nothing serious. She's too hard to please, She finds too many faults. And I keep telling her, she'll never find a saint in Fillmore. Ah... you never know. - What? You? - Yeah. Yeah... I guess you could do worse. Think, uh... Jack the ripper or Freddy Kruger. What? - Jason from Friday the 13th. - What about you, Mr. Buttface? - You have an eye for quality, Mr. Dean? - Yes, ma'am. Early Mexico Parish. Really in, these days. Well, I guess were ahead of our time. George picked that that up years ago, at a garage sale. A garage sale? Phew... That would bring 100 to 150 thousand dollars today. Really? Are you in the art business or...? Oh, no, uh... used to be a removalist. Oh, well, when you're in the business of... ...transporting objet d'art, you get to know the value... - ...for insurance purposes. - Ohh. Well... ...I guess we're fortunate that most thieves don't have your background, Mr. Dean. - Pardon? - We had a burgler in last year. Didn't touch that. Took the VCR and the stereo. Ah. It's these times, Mrs. Bealeman. You don't even get quality burglers. Oh, hah hah hah... Excuse me. - I think you do a wonderful job, Rose. and I... I wish I could help, but I've already made a considerable commitment to support Reverend Barton, who is, in fact, on the air right now. Excuse me. Hey, it's on now. [TV] To be in the service of the Lord is a special calling. - Rose, how did it go? - Not good. I think it went over better with Mrs. Bealeman. Ah, she was probably impressed by Steve's jacket. I've been kind of avoiding this, Rose but, what exactly is wrong with Steve? He didn't tell you? Umm... both kind of avoided it. I know he thinks that... it might scare me away. But, it won't. He has a malignant spinal tumor. Does that mean he's dying? Yeah. He never said a word. First few months, he cried... yelled. We all did. Then, he just sort of, accepted it. He was always a tough kid. Damn. I don't suppose there's any treatment or...? No. I'm just hoping he doesn't suffer too much, for too long. That's why the Rec Center was such a Godsend. Helping those kids... took his mind off it. Made him feel useful. GEORGE: Here it comes! [TV] I don't usually name names, but it is people like... ...Brother Daniel Ruffles and Brother George Bealeman... ...who show their genuous and continuous support... ...help keeps this ministry alive. You can see he hates that recognition. How can I compete with that? I don't have my own television show. People believe in TV, don't they? No, why don't we join our hosts inside? I need a drink. Give your love to the old... the infirmed... Give it to the children. Alright... I dubbed those pieces as close as I can. Works pretty good. So will this. It should transmit 20-30 feet. That cable. You know, Terry, I don't want to pry... but a guy with your flair for electronics... could earn $100,000 a year legitimate. 100 grand? A year? I earned... close to 100 grand, my last job. It took 20 minutes. How long was your last stretch? Five years. Okay, so I'm good at this stuff. Could never do math for shit. (snoring) So I say to you, I dont want your money. Give it to the children. What in the name of God was that? Oh, the switch. The wh-- wh-- what? The remote control switch I probably rolled on it. George... it's on top of the set. It's not plugged in. It can't possibly come on by accident. There's... There's no power in it. There's power in it, George. The power of the Lord. He spoke to us. The Reverend Barton spoke to us. It's 2:30 in the morning, dear. The Reverend Barton comes on at 8 pm. And besides, I never heard your Reverend Barton, suggest giving money to anyone else. He said, "Give it to the children," didn't he? It was a message from God. I know it. What children? We don't have any. Needy children, I suppose. Rose's children! Rose asked us for help, for the Recreation Center. GEORGE: No... I just dont know. - The Lord via television? - You say it yourself all the time, dear. The Lord works in mysterious ways. Hmm... I'd better call Rose tomorrow. I was planning to... make a contribution to the Center anyway. - For the children. - Of course you were, dear. (snoring) IRENE: George... (snoring) - George. - Hmm? I'm too excited to sleep. Do you feel like playing 'Ride the wild horse'? Ehh... Ohh... Ohh... uh... Maybe tomorrow night dear, my... back's been acting up a bit. I'll consider that a raincheck, then. Goodnight, dear. Goodnight... Irene. - Terry! Shit. What are you doing here? I was worried about you. How'd it go? Did it work? Like a charm. You nearly gave me a heart attack. Thought I was busted. You know how embarassing that would be for me? Three hours in the house, no loo, I'd be a laughing stock. Yeah, what about me? I'd be known as the slowest getaway driver in history. - Yeah. Car! - Get down! This is exciting. It's kinda like being in Vietnam. (both laugh) No, it isn't. Yo, Terry. I know I'm your getaway driver, but uh... do you mind giving me a little push? Oh, sure. - Get back! - I don't want to catch anything. (both laughing) Did you hear the one about the quadraplegic who... - who tried to swim the English Channel? - Nope. He had to turn back 'cause his ears got tired. That's funny, but uh... it's in bad taste, isn't it? No. Only if you say it. I'm allowed. - Ah... like when all the kids at the Rec Center call you the road runner? - They're allowed. - Kids are really straight, aren't they? - Yeah, they're pretty cool. TERRY: They think I'm a jerk. Yeah, well Terry, kids call it like they see it. Thanks. Well, I know what you're gonna be if we pass a big stairway. - Hm? - A test pilot. STEVE: Oh! Oh! Oh! (both laughing) STEVE: Hey! This is no cab! I just read this witness statement from the West Hollywood bank job. Lady swears one of the customers was Rod Stewart. - So...? This is Hollywood. - Yeah, but Rod Stewart's in England. Besides, this guy ran out of the bank right behind the gang, maybe, even with them. Rod Stewart, Willie Nelson, Terry Dean... I dont know. Sometimes, these leopards change their spots. But their soul to gang jobs? Nah! Maybe he's smarter than we thought. Maybe... I doubt it. - Come on. I've been waiting for hours. - I've been waiting for weeks. Well, I've been waiting for years. It's my turn. - It's my turn. Hey, hey, hey. I'll solve this. Have you kids heard of the wisdom of Solomon? - No. It's my turn. - Wait a minute. You see, there were these two women, fighting over possession of a baby. And King Solomon said cut the baby in half and give you half each. - Yuck! - So? - So... What if I take this paddle, snap it in half, and give you half each? - That's a realy dumb idea. - It's stupid. Now you see, the real mother said, "Don't cut the baby in half," "give it to her." And then Solomon knew she was the real mother. You're weird, Terry. I wanna play Space Invaders. It's my turn on that next. Your supposed to say give it to-- I guess there's a fine line between wise and weird. ROSE: No, no, Mr. Bealeman, whatever time's best for you. Terry! Tomorrow night? Sure, no, no problem at all. Thank you. Guess what? Mr. Bealeman wants to come here and check out the Hall to see what we need. Old George is coming through. Well, that good news. Now, I somehow get the feeling that you're involved in Mr. Bealeman's coming here? Me? No. I hardly spoke to George. I'm just gonna go and check on Steve. He's been in bed all day. He's been getting tired a lot quicker lately. Oh, he'll come good. He's a fighter. When's George coming 'round? 8 o'clock tomorrow night. - Good. See ya. Hey Rose, come judge which one's best. It wouldn't hurt to give George another push... a sign. Like the burning bush. No... been done. Yeah, 8 o'clock tomorrow night. I can set it up tonight. Hey Boss... sometimes you make it too easy. - Hey Steve, got any batteries? - I don't think so. Let me guess... the Bealeman's are in for a re-run? No... I've got something special in mind for George. Need some help? Not on this one. Definitely a solo job. I'm not gonna ask you what you're doing. But, I would like to know why. Why are you so intent on helping out? That's my job. Helping people who need help. Are your parents very religious, Terry? Nah... Devout atheists from memory. Anytime I went into a church as a kid... I used to knock off the poor box. Well... I was poor. - What changed you? - God. When he gave me this job as a-- When I was... like you said, born again. God told me that... Well, He told me not to talk about it. You just have to trust me, Steve. Yeah, I do. I... I dont know why, but I do. I'm afraid your ol' faithful getaway driver wouldn't have been much use, anyway. I seem to be getting low on gas, lately. Yeah, well... Get a good night's rest, Sundance. Leave this one... to ol' Butch. Terry... Next time you're talking to God... Do you think you can put in a good word for me? You got it. Don't know if it'll carry much weight, though. Last time I talked to Him... He called me a scumbag. He's really no scumbag. J-- J-- Just... Now he's got me doing it. He's got me doing it. I'm not trying to tell You how to do the job, but... Steve deserves better than me. He deserves a proper... professional idol. I'm not even sure this is how to help him. You haven't given me a sign. Jesus Chri--! Sorry about the blasphemy. Wasn't my fault. I... just forgot I was immortal, okay? And besides, if You'd have given me the wings, would have made the job a lot easier. Think about it. Omnipresent. Everywhere at all times. So, that's how You knew about all those crimes I committed. Everytime I did the wrong thing, You were there. Ah... I'd like to explain about that weekend in Las Vegas with... Froggy Franchetti's wife, and his mother-in-law. - They were both in the Jacuzzi-- - Good! I was hoping to catch you alone. - I need your help, Terry. - Ah, sure. - A favor. - Oh, you got it. First, I want to thank you about Steven... I know his condition hasn't improved but, He's really perked up since you came along. The kid's got ba-- ah, guts, Mrs. Garner. More than most of us, I'm afraid. You know, it's terrible to watch your child dragged down by illness. Worse, when it's both of them. - Rose hasn't got it? - Hm? Oh no, not physically. But, when Steve got sick, she turned off her life... and gave up a good job in public relations and all her friends in the city... and came home to help him. I know she loves working with the children, but she's still young and attractive. - She should have a fuller life. - Yeah, I know what you mean. Um... Do you find Rose attractive, Terry? Yeah, I reckon your daughter's a real class act, Mrs G. Good. Then, why don't you make a pass at her? Invite her out. Do anything. Well, I was... I was gonna do that, but Steve siad she'e pretty fussy and... I know I'm not exactly off the top shelf. Being fussy is just an act for Steven's benefit. A woman should to be told she's attractive, and desirable. Otherwise, she ceases to be either. Remind her. Put a move on her. You have her mother's blessing. Oh, for Gods sake, dont tell her that. I'm a lone wolf, Mrs G. I'm not looking for any ties. But, I'd be delighted to put a move on your daughter. As a favor. Not sure that Rose will be all that thrilled, though. Oh, don't worry, she's well aware of you. Has she said something? Um... She uh... takes off her glasses, fixes her hair... whenever you're around. That says enough for me. - Is... Is tonight too soon? - Ah. The sooner, the better. Terry... - I think you're a class act yourself. - Yeah? Hey... did You hear that? Class act. Hope You're taking notes. - Hi Rose. - ...Hi. - Just... preparing for the royal visit, are you? - Ohh... I was just trying to clean up a little bit, I guess. - A dump's a dump. - Yeah. I still don't understand why Mr. Bealeman's seems to have changed his mind about helping us. Ah, you know what they say, Rose: The Lord works in mysterious ways. Rose, could I take you out to dinner? I mean, uh, just to sort of celebrate George coming through. It'll be a little premature to celebrate. - Ah. Oh, yeah... - But, ah, Yes... I'd love to have dinner with you. You would...? Great! - I'd have asked you sooner only, ah... - Only...? I guess I figured you were way out of my league. It's probably the nicest thing... anyone ever said to me. 8 o'clock. I gotta meet George out the front. It's dark, you know. I don't want him to flip over and break his checkbook, do we? (Rose laughs) Mr. Bealeman, Terry Dean. We met the other night. Oh yes, of course, with Rose. I thought I'd better lead you up there, sir. It's quite dark around here. Yes, it certainly is. Thank you. There are some lights about but, ah... ...except for the Rec Hall, the power round here was, uh... ...disconnected, years ago. My God... It's obvious there's power somewhere. Beg your pardon? The light! On the cross! Where abouts? Didn't you see that? The cross all lit up? Oh, the old church. You got better eyes than me, Mr. Bealeman. No, it was bright. It was glowing. Ah... must have been the lights of a passing car. Or something. I can guarantee there's no lights in the old church. Went through it yesterday, trying to scrounge anything for the kids' hall. Not even a light bulb. No, there's, uh... no power in the old church. Except, maybe... Power of the Lord. I think we got him. We're a good team, You and me. Listen, Mate... Oh, I guess You've been asked the question a million times but... Is Elvis with you? Sir? Detective Freebody, robbery division, LAPD. What's the problem, officer? We're looking for a good friend... Mr. Terry Dean? Got a tip he was around these parts. Dean... Dean... Nah... doesn't ring a bell. - What's he wanted for? - He's not wanted for anything. We were just hoping that you could maybe help us out. - Yeah... - Yeah, he has been in here. He picked a fight with Stevie Garner. That's the darndest thing I've ever seen cause Steve's a crip-- He's in a wheelchair. Then, they drank together all night. Try asking Stevie. He's here now. He should know. He just left. Heh heh. Check around the back. Mr. Garner. Police officer. Hey! Damn! Beaten by a wheelchair. Very funny! Ha! Not nesessary, my boy, my path is brightly lit. - Oh well, goodnight then, Mr Bealeman. - Goodnight. Goodnight, indeed. Nah, quit while you're ahead. - Well... - ...how did it go? - He's not gonna fix up the hall. What? He's gonna build a new one! I can't wait 'til we tell Steve. I don't think I even thanked him. I reckon he knows you're grateful. You said the Lord works in mysterious ways, but I have a feeling, The Lord had a little extra help on this one? - Well... he's a busy God. - Thanks. Well... why don't you buy me that dinner, and maybe fill in a few blank spaces, mystery man. Me? I'm no mystery, Rose. I'm about as deep as a teaspoon. Something's wrong. Stevie, what's wrong? Look at you. Oh, you're bleeding. Gangs and bottles. A broken town. - In town? How long ago? - A long time. I'll call an ambulance. Keep that bandaged tight. Terry... 2 cops... they're looking for you. They know where I live. You gotta go. Shit. We'll get you fixed up first. I must have cut a vein. You know, they say you bleed to death in 15 minutes. It's been a lot longer. Terry... I'm dying... and I'm scared. Yeah. I know. But, there's nothing to be afraid of. Trust me, Steve. This isn't the end, this is just the beginning. I know. How you know? How can you know? 'Cause you gave your life for another. That's the way I died. That's the noblest way to go. God told me that. God told you? God? Yeah, God. God sent me back. To help you, Rose, the kids. Help the needy. But, you... you're not a scumbag like I was. No probation for you. Where you're going, you can forget the chair. You'll be able to run the 100... in 9.5. Steve... I'm only a probationary angel. You're gonna be the real McCoy. I know it. Terry, I know you believe, and I want to, but, I'm scared. I'm scared, man. - I'm scared. Can't You let this kid know it's gonna be alright? Please God... give us a sign to let him know I'm telling the truth. Oh God! Thank God. Hey... sis... - I'll run... the hundred... in ninety-five. (Steve moans) Stevie... Stevie... He'll be fine, Rose. He just looks so young. Steve's with God now. I know that for a fact. You really do believe that, don't you? Yeah. God gave me a sign. This isn't powered by God, Terry. - Just batteries. - I don't need batteries, Rose. God told me to do that. Terry, I heard what you told Steve And I'm glad he believed you. - But you can't expect-- - Rose... look at me. I don't wear funny robes or carry signs around. I'm not a religious nut. I just help people. Like you do. I don't think I'm an angel. Oh, I don't think I'm an angel, Rose. I know I am. (siren approaching) I've gotta go now. Now?... You're just gonna walk away? I have to go. There are things I have to do. But God said I can come back, if you want me to. I want you to. I will come back. I promise. I can't tell lies. I'm an angel. Well, almost. I hope I was right about him running the 100 in 9.5. Any slower than that, He'll be after my hide when I see him again. Terry! Holy Jes-- I'm cool. I'm getting used to it. Indestructible, right? I'll be back! (Terry's voice) Steve's with God now, Rose. THE END
