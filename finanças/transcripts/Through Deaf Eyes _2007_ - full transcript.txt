I was driving down on the freeway, oh it was a beautiful day. All the birds were flying and all the birds were singing and all the birds dropping, "Hey you," "I got you." All of a sudden I look through the rear view mirror, the guy behind me was so angry, "Hey you, what are you deaf, huh?" Well, that makes me angry, of course I'm deaf and proud. So I step on the gas. Oh, by the way I have a Mercedes 500 ACL. I'm rich and deaf, thank you very much. Finally I caught up with that car. Automatic window. "Hey you, what are you hearing, huh?" Yeah. When you talk to people who can hear and you ask them, "what do you think it would be like to be a deaf person?" Then all of their thinking is, "well, I couldn't do this. Can't, can't, can't, can't, can't." They would start listing all the things they can't do. And I don't think like that. Deaf people don't think like that. We think about what we can do. We sign, we make movies, we do stage performances, we can write books, but we make ourselves understood. ♪ It's just a deaf thing ♪ ♪ It's just a deaf thing ♪ There was a little girl, a neighbour girl that came over a Nd played with me. And we used gesture with each other. One time I went over to visit her, and I saw her using her lips to communicate with her mother. They weren't using their hands at all. And so I ran home and I asked my mother what was happening. Why aren't they using their hands? My mother said, "they're hearing." And I said, oh, well what are we? She said, "Daddy and I are deaf. You're deaf, your brothers are deaf." And I said, is everyone deaf? Is that little girl the only hearing girl in the world? She said, "No, everyone else is like them." And I said, oh, now I get it. Deafness is almost always one generation thick. Over ninety percent of all deaf people have parents who can hear. And most deaf parents have children who can hear. So deaf people interact on a meaningful and intimate level with hearing people all their lives. Yet most Americans have very little understanding of what it means to be deaf. I was doing an interview once with CNN. And the woman and I were getting ready, getting our make-up ready. And I mean this is live in front of millions of people. And I was ready to be interviewed. And everybody was in their positions. And with three seconds before the light was to come on the camera, the interviewer needed my attention and she said, "Marlee, my dog is deaf like you." And the next thing I know the light is on the camera. And there I am live. And I'm thinking in the back of my head, does she want to throw me a bone? Does she want me identify with her dog? I had no idea what the significance of that was. People need to realise that we're normal. Don't just look at my ear. Don't look at it is as a physical handicap. We're normal really. Yes, we do have some accommodations to be made to survive in a society where it's dominated by hearing people. But at the same time if you were to come into the room and it would be full of deaf people, then you would need the accommodation too. Thirty-five million Americans are hard of hearing to so me degree. Of these, an estimated 300,000 people are profoundly deaf. Deaf people can be found in every ethnic group, every region, every economic class. Some deafness is hereditary; some is caused by illness or accident. To be deaf is to be part of a tiny minority in a hearing world, but it is far from the uniform and tragic experience that most hearing people imagine. Being deaf is, well, it's part of me. It's something I have to deal with but it doesn't keep me from being happy. It doesn't make me either happy or sad. It's just like being a man instead of a woman or being tall instead of short. Maybe a person can't see and is that normal? Maybe it is. And maybe a person walks with a bit of a limp. Perhaps that's normal to one person and not to another. What about left-handedness? Is that abnormal or is that normal? We have two children. We have Bradford here who's probably the only kid in town who can talk on the phone and play basketball at the same time. He is our only hearing child. He has to sign all the time because there's no one else in the family who is hearing. Our daughter's eleven. She's deaf. We have just the two, and we don't want any more. We have a boy and a girl and that's enough for us. I guess we're the all-American family. Just the four of us. It's a nice number. Today it's entirely possible for a deaf family to call itself an all-American family, but that isn't how the story begins. For centuries hearing people saw deafness as a horrendous misfortune. When a Protestant revival swept through 19th-century America, fervent Christians laboured to bring the gospel to unbelievers. But one group of souls seemed locked away forever from the word of God. Most of the deaf people in America in the early 1800s lived in rural areas. They were separated from each other, they were isolated. Most had very little communication with the people around them. Deaf people had a limited understanding of what they could do, of their own possibilities. And people with deaf children really had no idea of what their children could achieve. Very few Americans believed that deaf people could be educated at all, until 1817, when a Connecticut clergyman named Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet discovered his mission in life: to bring the Gospel to people who could not hear. In Hartford, he opened the first permanent school for deaf children in America, with just seven students, and a head teacher from France who is now a legend in the Deaf community. Laurent Clerc was a teacher at the Paris Institution for the Deaf. And he was an extremely well-educated, sharp, witty man, who was very, very deaf, and had been very, very deaf since infancy. One of the things that Clerc brought to the United States was French sign language. Laurent Clerc taught using his hands: he communicated with sign. To Gallaudet, the language was a revelation. He called it "highly poetical." To Clerc, and to many deaf people, signing was natural, and practical. Clerc discovered that there were already some signs in use by some of his students. Clerc took his native French sign language and he blended it with a little bit of the signs that he saw students using here in the United States. The result was an American sign language that spread west and south as new schools for deaf children opened. New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Ohio, Kentucky, Tennessee, Indiana, Illinois. In 1864, Abraham Lincoln signed a law founding the first college in the world for deaf students. Eventually it would be called Gallaudet University. And all these schools used sign. My dear sir, the organs of speech are in no way effected by deafness. The deaf person is mute simply because he cannot hear, and hasn't been taught to speak. A contradiction in terms sir, a most illogical contradiction, the deaf mute's speech organs may be intact... In April, 1871, a bright young Scottish immigrant, Alexander Graham Bell, began teaching deaf children in Boston. Like Gallaudet, he had a passion and a mission: to bring language to deaf people. Nature inflicted upon the deaf child but one flaw. One little flaw, imperfect hearing. But we deny him speech by not teaching him to speak. Society in general views Alexander Graham Bell as an American hero, as the inventor of the telephone. He was famous, wealthy, and influential. His wife was deaf. His own mother was deaf. He was always associating with the Deaf community. He was a teacher of deaf children at a day school in Boston. He was very familiar with the deaf world. Alexander Graham Bell is a very important figure in Deaf folklore. He offers an antagonist perspective because he's like the boogie man. And even though he's a great man in his own right, but he did put forth the idea that a life without signing, would be a better life. Bell thought that signing prevented deaf people from learning to speak, so he was against deaf people using sign, their natural language. Bell believed that sign language marked them as different and kept them in the lower classes. He believed that earlier in the 1800s sign language had been their only recourse. But now there's a better choice, the technology to teach them to speak and lip read. The oral method. Bell thought, over a hundred years ago, that if every deaf child who received the right type of education and the use of the right technology, that those children could learn to use spoken language. Oral schools for deaf children opened in the late 1860s. They did not teach sign and, in fact, outlawed its use. Instead they began speech training, teaching deaf children to generate sounds, to mimic the mouth shapes and breathing patterns of speech. And if children knew what speech looked like, the oralists thought, they could learn to read lips. This was an idea that divided educators of deaf children, and it still does today. Oh, do you lip read? That's a very dangerous question because if you say, "yes" they, "blah-blah-blah." Whoa, wait, wait a minute. No, you have to go slower, then... No, no, no, no, no. Just talk normally. It was a bit hectic. We didn't really have a lot of time to prepare. But it's a take home. I mean we had all this homework and quizzes and stuff so I just lucked out. - Did you take a look at it? - I have it with me. I can understand people who speak directly to me in good light. And without too much background noise. And a lot of what I do in speaking is arranging these circumstances. And if that doesn't happen, I don't hear things. I can be part of the conversation without knowing what the other people are saying. Speaking, lip reading and participation in "normal" conversation was, from the beginning, the great goal of the oralist method. In 1880, the method was endorsed by an important international conference of educators in Milan, Italy. Oralism was beginning to win. Schools for deaf children all over the United States started, one by one changing, deciding that their particular school was not going to use sign language in the classroom any more. They changed their hiring practises. The teachers were forbidden to sign, and the children were forbidden to sign. After the Milan Congress the percentage of deaf teachers went way down because they couldn't teach speech. Those schools that were strong supporters of deaf teachers moved them to the vocational programs to avoid the parents' objections to them. Those were the dark ages for deaf education in America. Bell subscribed to two popular American movements that greatly bolstered the oralist cause. One was Nativism... the belief that the current flood of immigrants was threatening the American way of life. Many people were immigrating to this country from Eastern Europe and southern Europe, and this made a number of Americans very nervous. Ethnic groups often set up their own schools here; they published newspapers in their native languages. The Deaf community, too, had their own newspapers, their own schools, and their own churches, and used a separate language. And so people began to think of deaf people as an ethnic group, a group that should be assimilated into the general population. Bell was famous for going to school boards and state legislatures and arguing that American Sign Language was in fact a language borrowed from France. Sign Language was not supportive of American society. Bell was also a prominent leader in another movement that was newly-popular in America. Eugenics, the idea that planned breeding can improve the human race. "A defective race of human beings would be a great calamity" Bell wrote. "We must examine the causes that lead "to the intermarriage of the deaf "with the object of applying a remedy." He was an early eugenicist. He was quite concerned that if the deaf married other deaf individuals there would be an expansion of the Deaf community. He did not see this as a desirable thing. He wanted to try to eliminate deaf organisations if he could, find other ways to socialise deaf people among hearing people rather than deaf people. I think that Alexander Graham Bell's greatest crime was keeping deaf people apart from each other. It wasn't so much that he thought speech was important. Worse than that was that he didn't want deaf people to marry each other. He didn't want them to be near each other. He wanted them to be apart. But deaf children had to be educated, and the only practical way was in all-deaf schools, for the most part, residential schools. Here deaf children played together, shared stories, invented games, passed on unique customs and basic values. Even at oral schools, students would teach each other signing on the sly. It was all part of what would, in time, become Deaf culture. The schools for the deaf really were the first place where deaf people came together. And they shared their language, they shared their culture, they shared their stories about growing up. At times they had to grow up quickly. Children were often dropped off at boarding schools without understanding what was happening. Many arrived without even knowing their own names. From the age of four on up, they might be away from their families for months at a time. The first day at school, my mother said, "Oh Bernard, now you're in school. "And I want you to be a good boy. "Work hard. "Learn all you can." And I said, "yes," I understand, but what? She said goodbye. And she gave me a hug and she turned around and left. And I thought, why? And suddenly the superintendent took me by the hand and pulled me down the hallway. Well, years later I spoke with my mum and I said, "why did you leave me like that?" "Why didn't you sit and explain "that this school was a boarding school? "And that I would stay there Monday through Friday, "why didn't you explain all that? "You just left." And my mother said, "I know, "I just couldn't bring myself to say that." And then I understood. It was hard for her too. When I went in to the school for the deaf I was about five and I was so thrilled to get mail. A letter from my mum. My favourite holiday was Christmas. I always looked forward to the Christmas holiday. My mother would write on a card, "only two more sleeps and you will be home." It was counting the days for me to see how many days I would have to sleep at school before I was sleeping at home in the bunk bed with my brother. So it helped me have a sense of counting down to the time when I would be going home. The students always had each other. It was like a big family. And we learned a lot from each other. Maybe some things we learned were wrong and we may have had the wrong information sometimes but we were a family. And some of us had no communication at home. So we could share with each other, advise each other, help each other. One tradition was a special sign that students invented for each other, a sign they might keep for life: their name sign. When I got to the campus of the Alabama school for the deaf I didn't have a name sign yet. And after thinking about it for awhile and this is pretty typical of deaf people, they look to see what you're character is, how you behave, a personality trait and then they give you a name sign that sort of ties into that particular trait that's unique to you. Well, after time went by my friend said, "I got it. "I know the way you swivel your hips when you walk "and so we're going to give you this name sign." So it went from my elbow down to my hip. I didn't know I had that little bit of a swivel of a hip, I thought I walked like everyone else but that name sign was given and it's stuck ever since. Students might sign to each other, but not in class. For most of the 20th century, the vast majority of deaf teaching was based almost exclusively on spoken language. You weren't allowed to use sign during class. If you used sign during class you would be punished. They would make you put on white mitts and they would have strings attached to them so you wouldn't be able to use your hands. The rules in Clarke School as well as downtown Northampton, we had to keep our hands down and talk. We had to keep on talking and lipread. If we waved our hands, the teachers were afraid that if we used our hands, we would lose the quality of our speech. So when I went downtown there was a policeman in plainclothes. I did not know that he was watching me. When I went back to Clarke School the teachers told me, "Rodney, you were waving hands downtown." And warned me not to go downtown again. And many people don't realize that when children learn speech it's all repetition and speech training over and over again. Think of all the time I spent on it when I could have learned other things, be educated in other things. I spent so much time learning how to talk, how to say milk, cat, dog. Hours. Holding my face, pushing my mouth, making things go back and forth trying to make the right movements. This is an M. Awful. There have always been what's referred to as oral failures. The technology of the day was limited and those children may have had more difficulty developing spoken language. Over a period of a few months, our class has been able to learn approximately 50 nouns. Now their skills are being advanced by writing and saying from memory. - Bike. - Write it. Even the adults today who talk about oral failures, they are thinking about their own experiences going to the speech teacher or being at an oral school for the deaf and not being successful or really struggling to communicate. Right. Finish it. You're not finished. You forgot. That's right, sit down, Lynn. I can say that I was considered a successful oral person, for many years I was mainstreamed in a public school. I was able to use my speech with my family and my friends. I had a lot of speech training. I used hearing aids and was trained auditorally, but in my mid-twenties when I went to graduate school or I was in graduate school, I realized how hard I was working just trying to lipread. It would just completely wear me out. My oral abilities were limited. I learned vocabulary in English but I couldn't speak it. My parents were relying on my speech, so I couldn't show them my intelligence. You asked me to speak so I can demonstrate how successful I was as an oral deaf person. But understand that speaking is only one way. And that if I speak the other person hears me. They assume that I don't need any sort of interpreting or any kind of sign or anything like that. They assume that I can hear them. And that's the problem with speaking. It's a two-way communication. That's why I don' t. I don't want people to assume that I can hear them because I can't. It's much easier just to turn off my voice. I have always had my feet firmly in both the hearing world and the deaf world. I've always been very comfortable in both worlds. I've always been hungry for information about both worlds. I've always wanted to be connected to people, to humanity. It didn't matter whether they were hearing or deaf and I'm very fortunate that I had the communication skills to do so relatively, comfortably. I know that my speech is not exactly normal. But it's very understandable. That's gotten me through situations in communicating with hearing people. It's common for deaf people to talk about two worlds, one hearing and one deaf. At times these worlds seem to be two different planets and so a special notion has evolved in the Deaf community. A separate planet of sight, without sound. We have this planet which we call earth. We spell it E-A-R-T-H so it relates to the ear, to speaking and hearing. There's this other planet E-Y-E-T-H. And that relates to the eye and the visual. So there are two worlds. I grew up on Earth. Now, I'm on this other planet, E-Y-E-T-H, a world where all these possibilities are open to me. But back in the early 20th century, America was on the planet Earth, not on the imaginary planet of Eyeth. On Earth, discrimination against deaf people was so much a fact of life that, by 1880, they had founded an organization to protect themselves: The National Association of the Deaf. In 1906, the U.S. Civil Service flatly stated that it would no longer allow deaf people to work for the government. So the N.A.D., and its president, prepared for battle. George W. Veditz was the sev enth president of the NAD. He was loud, forceful, clear and not ashamed. He got up and spoke out. The fiery Veditz launched an aggressive grassroots campaign against the Civil Service decision. Letters poured in to elected officials. After two years of protest, Theodore Roosevelt repealed the guidelines. Deaf people had won the right to work for their country. “The deaf themselves fought shoulder to shoulder,” a proud Veditz wrote. George W. Veditz was one of the most well known presidents of the National Association of the Deaf. He was a beautiful writer, a beautiful signer, really a genius in every sense of the word. George Veditz knew four languages. He raised chickens, wrote poetry, and worked as a printer, teacher, and newspaper editor. He won horticultural awards for his dahlias at the Colorado State fair, and once earned a draw with the world chess champion in an exhibition match. In 1910, he started yet another project. Making movies. Starting around 1910, the NAD produced films in an effort to preserve sign language, shooting footage of signing masters. They raised funds and then produced a variety of films that showed these masters telling deaf people stories. Before the invention of film, when sign language was shown, it was static. A drawing couldn't show the movement. The Deaf community finally had a way to show what real sign language looked like. The NAD films were like all the other films from their era: silent. Deaf actors were made for the medium. They could play hearing characters, or deaf ones. Silent films showed deaf characters as being dummies, objects of humor. But at least a deaf person could watch the film and understand it. That was lost after 1929. Now a gala event ushers in a new era in motion pictures. With the premiere of “The Jazz Singer,” starring Al Jolson, sound comes to the screen. The transition from silent movies to talkies was a disaster for deaf people. - Another party? - And what a party. The talkies didn't change one thing: deaf characters were still stereotypes. Johnny Belinda won an Academy award in 1948. The character Belinda is seen as this poor, innocent, weak woman. Her deafness makes her even more vulnerable. The fact that this dummy character blossoms by using sign language was enough. The Deaf community was excited and proud of the film, even though the stereotype itself was terrible. Belinda, searching, ever searching for happiness and understanding, but ready to fight with primitive fury. I was concerned that my friends woul d see that character and think that all deaf people were, were like that. Hollywood films weren't made for deaf people, but they had been creating their own diversions for years. Deaf communities had theatrical societies, literary circles, masquerade balls, organized debates, sports teams, and travel groups. The Deaf culture that had taken root in the schools for deaf children cropped up all across the country in deaf clubs, for adults. People came together to sign, to help each other, and, quite simply, to have a good time. My parents were deaf. My parents had many deaf friends. They had an active schedule. We went to the deaf clubs. We went to deaf people's homes. It was a natural community for me as a kid growing up. It was like a kid who grew up in an immigrant family where many of the friends spoke a different language. Instead of speaking Italian, our family spoke sign. I love you. I love George Washington. I love my country too. I love the flag, the dear old flag of red and white and blue.
