[yawning] [engine rumbling] [instrumental music] [rooster crowing] [male narrator] It sure was a beautiful morning. The sun came up glowing and glitzeling. And when the dawn broke all the witzel birds woke. The witzel birds all woke up witzeling. [birds chirping] [music continues] [dramatic music] [male narrator] An unusually beautiful morning it was. Even the Grinch woke up witzeling. [whistles] His dog, Max, was amazed! He stared up from the floor. A witzeling Grinch? Never happened before. Never before had this nasty, old guy left out of his bed with a smile in his eye and witzeling, "Hello," to the birds in the sky. [whistling] Unbelievable! This was gooder than good. This was grander than grand. There was peace in his heart. There'd be peace in the land. And a very good morning to you, Mr. Grinch. Oh, it is, is it? Well, i-it seems so, sort of. I see nothing to witzel about. You must be out of your head, no doubt. I think the time has come for thee to repeat the Grinch's oath with me. [both] A Grinch is unhelpful unfriendly, unkind. With ungracious thoughts.. ...in an unhealthy mind. A Grinch is uncheerful uncouth and unclean. 'Now, say this together!' [both] I'm frightfully mean! My eyes are both shifty. My fingers are thrifty. My mouth will not smile. Not half of an inch. I'm a Grinch. I am a Grinch. I'm a Grinch! That's my boy! Now, go out and prove it. [whimpering] [The Grinch] Prove it. Prove it. Prove it. Prove it. [instrumental music] [engine revving] [tires screech] [engine revving] [birds chirping] [engine revving] [tires screech] Prove I'm a Grinch. Hah!
