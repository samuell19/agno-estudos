Shut up, Whiskas. Hey, be quiet. Sit! Sit! Sit! That's a good dog. Idiot! - Bastard! Move it! The news: The Pope islanding in Berlin tonight. Hundreds of people have gathered there. Demonstrations in town are causing major traffic jams. Victor! Hey, Victor! Hi, Zombie. I got a smoke for ya. Hey, fella. Hey, Victor... Shut your eyes. - What for? C'mon! - Not my cap! I didn't even see who threw it in. Maybe some guy with a bad conscience. Suddenly the mutt went nuts about a stupid plane and when I looked down again, there were 100 marks in the pot. Maybe it was the Pope, or Mother Theresa. Thieves and whores are nothing but trash! - Are you crazy? Just because I let you fuck me doesn't mean I'm your property! Kiss my ass, you bastards! That's my bag! Stop him! That's my bag! Stop! Stop him! Watch out, young man! - Sorry... the thief... my bag. Stop! Stop him! The "Triple S Program" stands for service, security and sanitation. We want to increase your comfort while you are here. How much money did you have in the bag? Money? - Approximately. - It was in my jacket. What did you have in the bag? Thongs! A bunch of shit! Hey! Condoms! That guy must've been horny. What's this shit! - He looked loaded. - Now we gotta go bumming again. I told ya this place is no good. The loot's where the Pope's at at the airport. I have the impression you don't want to help me, or you can't. Sorry, I know as little as you do. You can at least check if Ms. Oshimoto is on the plane. Due to the arrival of the Pope... I don't care about the Pope! Our company has an important meeting... - Nippon Airlines. - Not a glimpse of the Pope. - See that? I really got that cop! - We gotta go to the stadium if we wanna catch him. Oh well... My dear Dr. Schneider... If you only knew. And who's the sucker? Who drives to the airport and waits around all night? Oh well... Are you hungry? Here, take it. Here... Eat. Yummy. Oh well, I'm just too good-natured. What a bummer that I end up hanging around here with you. I shoulda known. You're sick! You're so fuckir jealous! I thought we'd have a helluva night. We'd go out to eat... with a hotel and a bath and all. - Hanna! - Forget it! C'mon, Whiskas! Hanna! I still got 80 marks from selling newspapers. If we put it together, we'll have 180 marks. Find yourself somebody else... Shit! Hanna! Aw shit! Shit! Leave me alone! Just cool it. Things'll turn out okay. "Turn out okay!" My clothes were clean this morning! Thanks, Zombie I can't go to the laundromat every day! It's all your fault! No. Hey, look. 180 marks. That makes... 80 marks for the hotel and 40 marks for dinner. That's 120 marks. 20 marks for a taxi... That's 140-What taxi? We'll take a taxi to the hotel, okay? That Negro boy! I gotcha, buddy! Now give me back my wallet. Or you won't know what hit you. Do you read me, huh? C'mon! So you wanna act dumb, huh? C'mon. You guys are all the same. Ouch! Come here! Or should we call the police? Huh? Come here... My God. Well, what do we have here? Hey, pal. Kids like you deserve a good whacking. Cigarettes! Come here. Now we're getting down to business. Come here! C'mon! Listen here, buddy. Not with me. Now what do we have here? Feliz Kolami from Angola. Just arrived and already a thief! Was that you with the sandwich? Your wallet. My God, I thought... Thank you. Now leave the boy alone. Thank you. Oh, my God. Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit! You're waiting? Ah yes, show me. Here it is... You got a mark for something to eat? - No, just a 2-mark piece. - That's okay. Thanks to you, too! Yes? Hello? Don't be so shy. Call up again when you've learned to talk. Father. Parents? Africa? And who's this? A friend? It looks like he stood you up. My God, what am I doing here? This is... I don't have time. Listen... Here's your dinner. What're you lookir at, buddy? Boy, oh boy... Hey, sweetie. How about you? One... one of those little bottles of brandy, please. Good evening. Ever read our "Homeless News?" Special edition for the Pope's visit. 2 marks. 1 mark for me and 1 mark for our welfare project with a shower and washing machine. It's for a good cause. Yeah, I know. I can tell you're a nice guy. Hey, the newspaper! - Good evening. - Good evening. Where to? Well... I bet you know where things are happening here. Really happening. You're a real joker, pal. What are you up for? A bar? Dancing? No, not exactly. I mean... Where... uh... you know... What do I know? Do I look psychic? I mean some place where... My God! Where I can meet somebody. Why didn't you say so right away? I thought you wanted to see the Pope. It's biology, as I always say. If your old lady won't let you... You're not from here, huh? Zippelsf√∂rde. Zippel what? From up north. Near Neuruppin. What do you do there? I got a farm. I was wondering where that cow smell came from. Sorry, pal... You've come an awful long way. There ain't much going on up there. I mean cultural stuff. You need a change of scenery, huh? Wanna milk some other cows! Good evening. I don't usually take dogs. It's a really distinguished dog. It costs extra if he dirties the seat. Maybe we oughta get out again. Where do you wanna go? To a hotel, please. Which hotel? Who cares. Some really distinguished place where we can sleep. It could be difficult. There must be a vacancy somewhere! The Pope's in town. The place is packed. - We couldn't care less about the Pope! C'mon! Find us a decent spot! I get 20 marks in advance. It's subtracted from the fare. Do you think we ain't got any dough? I've had my experiences. - Hey, bastard! Do you think you're better than us? She means... - Think we can't get along without you? Has everybody left already? We're closing. What's up? Did I tell you to run after me? What should I do with it? I already... Kastanien Boulevard Kastanien Boulevard... It must be somewhere along my route. Seven Kastanien Boulevards! Seven! And where's yours? In Hellersdorf. My God. Do you know where Hellersdorf is? Your pal might as well live in Bavaria! Hands off, you hear? Okay, what should I do with you? My God, I really ought to throw you out. Be happy that there are such good-natured idiots like me with nothing better to do at night than tour the town with little Negro boys. In Hellersdorf! 32 marks 20. Lots of good lookir girls here. Make it 35. Got any larger bills? No. 40, 50, 100... Have a nice evening. Same to you. Bye. - Bye. Wanna fuck? - What? You look like you wanna fuck. Wh... Where'd you get that idea? Blow job 50, intercourse 80. Extras more. With a rubber. No bondage. I didn't want to... C'mon! - What's up? - Pick somebody else. I just asked for cigarettes. - Shut up! I told you to get lost! - Let go! Damn it! Let me go! Have you made up your mind yet? Is everything okay? It's none of your business, okay? Well... I just thought... It's okay. What do you say? She didn't call you? Yeah, those Japs. Usually you can keep time by them. Brainstorming in your office tomorrow? Okay. Of course, you can have someone call me if she gets in touch. Have a nice evening, Dr. Schneider. Goodbye... Dr. Schneider, my boss. Boss... Chief, huh? 35 years old and already at the top, my boy. He wouldn't waste his time like me here. I once saw a black guy on TV who could talk. I see. You guys use smoke signals. There was a crash here, you see? A crash. You were in a hurry and not alert? I've told you everything We have to report everything, especially for insurance purposes. - There's a kid waiting at the airport. Alone! I have to pick him up! Nobody gets lost in Germany. It was no reason to get excited. He just wanted to know if we had dough. He was scared shitless. His seats... We'd have given him the dough. You think he'd have done that with a normal passenger? Yeah, he just couldn't tell that we were rollir in money. I wanna be treated like everyone else. Sure. That's why we're walking instead of being driven to the hotel! Did you see the shitty shoes that guy had on? - Who? The taxi driver. - Not again. Worn out, black, woven in front. - So what? Would you buy shoes that are woven in front? No, you wouldn't. They're for sweaty feet and for guys who have never done a decent day's work. You know why? They split apart. - And here I am, walking! You can learn a lot by looking at people's shoes. Have you ever wondered why some women wear high heels? You think it's sexy, but what's so special about it? The sound, of course... It says, "A womars coming." Not just any woman, but one with pretty legs. Without looking you get a hard-on. Or the guys with the pointed cowboy boots... cool and easy-going. In reality, they're just normal guys who've seen too many cigarette ads. The shoes are as long as their cocks should be. - Hanna! C'mon, Whiskas. Get in. Oh man. Hi. - Hello. Good evening. A room? - For 30 minutes. - 20 marks, please. 50... Thank you. 30 marks change. Room 3. Hi, Bert. By the way, I'm Jochen. - Patty. It's fucking cold here. Gimme the dough first. It's 20 marks extra if I get undressed. Any special requests? No. I don't know if I got a 20. It's okay. - Thanks. Don't you wanna get undressed? 30 minutes are over fast. They stole my condoms, you know. Hey, c'mon. Stop it! Shit, they're too cold, huh? No, no... You got special requests after all? Okay then... I can't. What's wrong? I'm sorry. - Hey, stay here. You paid, so you're gonna get decent service. I don't want it. You're a bit young, aren't you? - 18. And this place here. I've never run into anyone like you. You spit out the cash and then? 20 more minutes... Fucking cold. 20 minutes... That's so... Pay more, stay longer. No, that's not what I meant. It's not my thing. I'll make you a deal. Add 500 marks, and you can have me all night. I'll show you everything. Wherever and whatever you want, okay? 17 marks 10. They usually got vacancies here. Need a receipt? No. Here we are. Keep the change. - Thanks. Bye. - Have a nice evening. - Ditto. Are you crazy? We aren't made of money! Shoving that money down Fatso's throat! - C'mon. And leave the mutt outside! Whiskas is coming with us! Hanna, wait till we get the room. Wait here. We'll be right back. Good evening. - Good evening. We'd like a room. - For two? ...How long? Till tomorrow morning. - One night. You're lucky. A reservation was cancelled... Room 314. Would you please fill this out? The room costs 180 marks, including breakfast. You can take a look at the room if you like. A really difficult job... but not for Peschke. He finds the harbor on a foggy night. 69 Kastanien Boulevard. You see, Dr. Schneider. We're already there. Well, how did old Peschke do? Everybody out! A nice neighborhood. Oh shit. That's why I love villas. N-du-a-di-ki, Nduadiki... There! Nduadiki, 10/1. 10/1. Did ya see that? Hey, pal. Of course nobody's home! Geez! My God! Yes? - Hello? Excuse me for disturbing you. I'd like to ask you something. - What? It concerns your neighbor. Here's a child that belongs to him. Do you know when Mr. Nduadiki comes home? - He lives next door. Yes, I know. But when is he coming home? No idea. - Here's a boy that belongs to him. He's a cook. He comes home late. - I see. Sure, I wear out my tires and sacrifice my valuable time! So the relatives can have a night out! What else are idiots like Hendrik Peschke good for, huh? I've got nothing better to do! You stay here and wait. Hello! "Am Oranienplatz!" That's the name of the bar! In Kreuzberg! That's where he works! Thanks a lot! ...As if I give a shit. Where's the key? ...In the ignition. Let's get a room and hightail it tomorrow morning. - No crooked stuff! What if every place is too expensive? We'll be running all over town. A taxi's too expensive. - Shoving that money down his throat! Cool it. We'll find something. - No, we won't I thought I'd be lying in the tub drinking champagne by now. Instead, I'm traveling from one stinking station to the next. Downtown, there's one hotel after the next. We'll find a place. In the statiors restroom. - You're loads of fun! Tickets, please! My God, we aren't spared a thing! - Thank you. Thank you. - Whiskas, a conductor. If you don't mind... - Here you are. Thank you. Is this your dog? - Yeah, it's a really distinguished dog. Get him a leash and a muzzle. It's the law. Whiskas only bites people he doesn't like. May I see your ticket? Do you have my ticket and ID? - Why should I? We got time. - I must've lost my ticket somewhere. If you don't have a ticket, it costs 60 marks. She's got a ticket. We get 'em from welfare. Either 60 marks or an ID. It was here a minute ago: A plastic sleeve with my ID, my ticket... A credit card. - Hey, pal. What's the big idea!? Either an ID, or you come with me. - Are you trying to insult me? Take it easy. - We'd be stupid not to get a ticket. Get out, please! - I gotta let that watchdog insult me? Pull yourself together! - C'mon! Hands off, asshole! - Don't touch her! C'mon out! - Hey, bastard! Leave my clothes alone! Just cool it. - Grab your old lady's tits instead! Shut up, you bitch! That's enough. Apologize to the lady. - Let go, or we'll crack down on you! We know how to handle types like you! Let me go, asshole! Let me go, bastard! Excuse me. Have you seen a small black boy? About 12 years old. One was here a while ago. Quite a while ago. - You know where he is? Some rich guy left his money here. He was a bit older. May I? It looked like he'd nabbed the boy, 'cause he thought he'd robbed him. Later, they left together. Are you his father? No, I was supposed to pick him up. - Call the cops. No cops! I get it. - He's coming to visit me. The guy's name is Peschke, from some machine manufacturing company. It was on his calling card. Peschke! Fuck off, you bum! My God. Stop looking at me like that! I'm looking for Mr. Nduadiki. - Ricardo. He's off tonight. I have to... - Just a sec. - Okay. What a nice jacket you got. You made the grade, huh? I can tell. Want me to buy you a beer? - No, I don't drink. That's good... Is that your boy? Looks just like his dad. - Take your beer and shut up. Bingo! Great! - Ricardo's here tomorrow night. Should I give him a message? I need him now. The boy is his. Not another one. - Why? Have you ever seen an African boy come here for vacation? I gotta work. Do you want Ricardo's number? - I already have it. Thanks. Hey, you can't run off and steal my lucky charm! Well, what do we do now, Dr. Schneider? No Ricardo! C'mon! Get in! Hey! Hands off! - He's comir! Step on it! - Move over! Stop! Stop! That's my car! Help! Police! Shit! You oughta sit back down. This'll take a while. - I'm not sitting! Frank, will you bring me a Big Mac? C'mon, Victor. Let's go. Let's go. Alright... Henschel, Johanna. Born on March 31, 1969, in J√ºterbog. Presently, no permanent address. And you're Mr. Buchmann, Victor. Could you call your dog, please? - Whiskas, come here! Born on April 15, 1962, in Berlin. - Sit! Presently, no permanent... Lie down. - Shit! Where's the "w?" Why do I always gotta be the sucker? Shit, Victor! Ms. Henschel, would you please sit down? - No, I won't! You can leave when we're finished! - Cool it, Hanna. C'mon, let's get outta here! - Would you please sit down!? That bastard can't tell me what to do! - Just call me a "bastard" once more, and I'll have you taken away! - Cool down, man! I got witnesses, so watch out! C'mon, sit down. - Sit down! Bastard! Why don't you have a permanent address? Sleeping outside is so romantic. Hanna and I would like to live together. I thought they offered you a bed in a shelter. - Yeah... You want me to get warts? They got such creeps there, the kind the F√ºhrer dreams of. - You have a daughter? Ms. Henschel... They took her away. Believe me, I was a good mother! Try to pay the rent from the pittance welfare gives ya. You gotta kiss their feet out of gratitude. No jobs at all. All those government bastards want is their dough! - Slow down. I've had a hard day here, too. I'm so sorry. - Let's pull ourselves together, okay? When I... When I get a job, we want to take back Hanna's daughter. Why did you attack the security men, Ms. Henschel? Me? - Yes, you. - They attacked me! Look at this! Or do you think I ran into a lamppost? - She's right. You neither had a valid ticket nor an ID? I must've left it somewhere. In the taxi maybe. A taxi? - Yes, a taxi. You were asked repeatedly to leave the subway. You didn't have to sic your dog on the officers They grabbed my tits! - Oh yeah... Would you let 'em do that to you? But I'm a woman. Who cares! Anybody can grab my tits! I'm just a fucking doormat for every asshole! Shit! I'm sorry, but... - Hanna. Leave me alone. Is this a petting zoo or what? Come here, Whiskas. Since I have two contradictory statements, I'm forced to pass on the report. I'm afraid you may have to go to court. I know that it's almost eleven, but I'm looking for a child. No! Your husband! No husband... Okay. Sorry, Ms. Peschke... Could... Found him? There are lots of Peschkes in town. - Does the boy have an address? Maybe he's already there? You know why he's here, Rita? I can guess. - So I tell his parents, "Sorry, the kid is gone, lost." He isn't gone. Fuckir expensive here. - That's okay. A little culture's always good for you. It's still a waste of money. What surprised me about the movie was why everybody wanted to go to the sea. It's boring there... Nothing but water. It's lots more fun in the big city. - Keep your voice down. Oh, was I too loud? I didn't even notice. With all your smoking and that candy at the movie, it's no wonder you're always cold. Sure, it isn't pretty to be fat, but you need some meat on your bones. Don't keep telling me what to do! Hello, I'd like to buy a rose. 5 marks. I gotta get my wallet. - Shit. Here you are. Keep the change. To your health. You already paid me. Take it anyway. I gotta go pee. Shit! That good stuff! Where're you going? - This place sucks! Anyway, you wanted to see where the action is. - Sure, but... I know a cool joint. - At least we could've waited for the steak. You can get something there. - We order and then... I don't get it. You said "Buchmann?" I can't find your reservation. Maybe you talked to my colleague? We're here because of the Pope. - Yeah, we've been booked up for weeks. Until tomorrow... If I could only be sure. Someone hasn't arrived yet... 412. What does the room cost? - 95 marks, breakfast included. Okay, we'll take it. Yeah, it's almost eleven. Okay, fill out the cards. And then I need your IDs. Oh, I forgot mine. One's enough. You're married? - No, why? Oh, I'm sorry... I can't give you a double room. We're a Christian house, and we have certain principles. What does that mean? - It means you can't sleep in one room if you're not married. Not here anyway. We want to pay for it! Just one night. By tomorrow, we'll be gone. Nobody'll notice. Young man, that's not the point. The church is against self-deception. Is this a church? No! And no sleazy hotel! Do you think I'm a whore? Huh? - Not so loud. Our guests are sleeping. I don't give a shit if they're sleeping! Do you think I'm a whore? C'mon, Hanna. - That's the limit! - We have our moral principles. Shove your moral principles up your ass! - Cool it, Hanna. Leave this hotel at once! - You think you can insult me, huh? You don't have the right! And your church can kiss my ass! If you don't leave at once, I'll call the police. Apologize to me at once! - Let's go, Hanna. I'm not going till she apologizes! - Hospice here! I'm having trouble with some guests. Could you send by a patrol car? I oughta burn this joint down and the church, too! You fucking pigs! Let me go! Damn it! Hello? ...The incident seems to have taken care of itself. Jesus! Now you listen to me! - Let go, or I'll scream my head off! Why are you always picking arguments? - You can't tell me nothir I can't take it anymore. All this trouble just because of you! Oh, so it's my fault? - Yeah! Don't you see the airs those guys put on? Did you see her shoes? Fur-lined boots! Have you ever seen what the opening looks like? Like a cunt! And she had the gall to call me a whore! Hanna, that's all a bunch of shit! Hey man! Open your eyes when people insult you! Hanna! - I have an eye for stuff like that. I really like you. Think about us getting married. Shit! What if we were married, Hanna? Yeah! So the dear Lord would let us sleep in a hotel! Know what? You make me sick! Your humble puppy-dog look. Your constant pawing. Your stupid family talk. I'm still getting over my first marriage! I'm never gonna marry you. And I'll have the baby aborted. I'd die before I give away another kid! - If you do, I'll kill you! You can't tell me nothir! I do what I want! I'm never gonna have another kid! Never again! And never from you! - You won't do that! Understand? You won't do that! It's my child! Do you understand? Mine! I'm not gonna let you insult me! Find yourself another idiot! I won't take it! Never again! Do you understand? Never! Please, stop it! Stupid bitch. Was it locked? - I was just in the bar for a second. A bit careless for that part of town. Should I have taken the car in with me? Okay, if you'd sign here, please. I'll put out the alert, but don't get your hopes up With the Pope in town we got our handsfull. - You can surely do something... I work for a company, you see... - Don't you realize how busy we are? I got... Real funny! I've experienced almost everything here but preparations for war. May I use your phone? - Dial zero first. - Okay. If that's the old man , I won't answer it. - Gimme it. - Fuck off. - Gimme it. If that's a trap, we're really gonna get fucked. Hey, shut up! ...Telephone Counseling. Got a problem? Don't get impertinent! I got 'em on the line Listen! That's my car! - Do you understand? - Not anymore. I'll give you one more chance. Turn around and park the car where you got it. Is that clear? We got a little problem here. There's no music in the car. - Right on! We want music! - It's a shame, pal. Your problem. The radio is encoded. You'll get your car back, okay? But you gotta tell us the code. You think you can bargain with me? No way! Do you know what it sounds like when you kick the ceiling of a car? Just a moment... Hello? ...Just a moment... I... The code is 1... 6... 0... ...8. Wasn't so difficult, huh? Now go to bed and dream about your nice car, okay? And keep cool! Hello? They hung up, those pigs! Thank God, they aren't Poles. Hey, pull over! Somebody's lying on the street! Hey, what're you doing here? The old bag's drunk! - Fuck off! Shit, what happened to you? Wanna see a doctor? C'mon, get up. You can't stay here. - What's the deal? - Shut your fucking mouth! Should we drive you home? Forget the old bag and get back in the car! Hey, do you want a swig? Thanks. I've had it! Get in the car, will ya! Hey, great... - Leave it, okay! You make me puke. Thanks for the ride. - With weather like this! Let me know when the boy shows up. - Do you have a phone? 5052694... Good luck. Sorry. - Thank you. Rita! Thanks for everything. Got anything to eat? ...Eat! Ah, the lucky charm. I was afraid I might have to do without you. Of course it's raining. When my car gets stolen, it rains. It all fits together. Right, Dr. Schneider? Taxi! Taxi! Oh no! I don't believe it! And you stop laughing! I'm doing all this for you. Would you stop laughing? Do you know what I have to do tomorrow? Appointments, appointments, and no car! Do you know what it's like without a car? It's like having no legs. The insurance company... car rental... the appointment with the Japanese. My God, the Japanese! Have to get my cell phone disconnected. C'mon, let's go. Nothing matters now anyway. It's a cool place, isn't it? - Well... You're a strange bird. - Why? First you don't wanna fuck, then you drag me all over town. You spend loads of money. We're going out together, like good friends. - Arert there any women in your town? Sure, but they're married, or stuck up, or both. I chased after one for 7 years. Then she married a farmer. 7 years! You're still awfully young. I mean, for what you do. I'm tired of walking around. Should we look for a room? I know where. How long has he been lying here? - He was lying here when we came. Hello! Hello! Hello! Got a cigarette? Have you been to see the Pope? Thank you. They're gonna get soaked. Oh well, it's their own fault. Good evening. - Mr. Menzel, the key's on the table. Good night. - Good night. Hey, you got rooms here? What d'ya think this is, darling? I've been livir off it for 35 years. My old man used to be the boss here. But now he's wormbait. Do you have any vacancies? For you alone? Then where's the girl? She got outta the rain. - Go get her. 80 marks, breakfast included. Bargain price, out the back. It's a deal. But you gotta pay in advance. - I'll be right back. Shit! Shouldn't we go back? I mean... At last! Alex! Alex, I need the room. You can sleep up front. What a dump. - Not good enough for ya? Why don't we go back to the first place? - Go up front. I need the room. Shit! You'll save money. They're all friends of mine. Fucking cold! - Do you live here? Do I look like I do? I'm gonna get ready for bed... Okay? Don't! Stop it! I got a room for us. - Fuck off! I didn't mean it... Really. You're no better than my first guy and all those other assholes. It's because of the child. I... I love you. How can I prove it to you? And this here? Is this your proof? It's also... my child... Hanna. The child! The child! What should the child eat? Where should it sleep? We just aren't gonna make it. I found a place. Less than 500 yards. 80 marks, breakfast included. And no stupid questions. You're soaking wet. You won't touch me... Is that clear? Yeah... Oh well. Oh dear. Hey there! Take your shoes off! Shoes off! And don't look around the place. I'm not prepared for visitors. Oh man... Oh well... You guys don't always clean things up in Africa either, do you? Oh well... Phone, huh? Hello? Nduadiki... Hendrik Peschke. Are you missing anything? - Yes, I... I had an accident. How's the boy?

Not my business? Do you think I gave you 500 marks to buy this stuff? It was no present. - This is really sick. You take this stuff and sleep with the most disgusting guys. You're no older than 18! - I picked this job, okay? I earn loads. And you can't stop me! - You won't shoot up while I'm here! Let go! Don't take that stuff! Forget it! Farmer! You stink like a cowshed. Let me go! Let me go! - Don't take that stuff! Damn it! Stop it! Stop it! You're sick! You big fat ass! Slug him in the face! Come over here! Hold him! C'mon. Cool. Hey, Victor. They even got a TV here. And a bed... I don't believe it. It smells like lilacs. Just a minute. I gotta take a look. A shower. Cool. Just for the two of us. A shower. It'll be okay. Wait... I'll go shower first. A shower's a really great invention, isn't it, Victor? Victor? - What? ...Yeah! Shit! It isn't warm! It isn't getting warm, damn it! Damn it! Why do I always have such bad luck? Why can't I have any luck? Hey! Can't this lousy joint have some warm water? I'm not asking for anything special. No bathtub, no swimming pool. Only some warm water. Shit! Just when you think you got it made, they screw ya bad. Shit! Shit! Shit! Okay, Victor. Time for you to shower. Didrt that old bat say anything about warm water? Idiot! My God. Today, I invite all of you to... I am also searching... Here. Sleep tight. Let us thank the Lord, our God. We thank you, God, the Almighty and praise you... Hold onto it. You gotta cool it. In the midst of mankind, which is divided and torn apart, we learn that you are prepared to forgive us. Do you believe that we go to heaven when we die? Or to hell? That's where I'm going. If you want me to, I'll get you outta here. I earn enough. There's enough work to do, too. My mother... You'd get along with her. With the animals, too. At first, they all look the same. A cow is a cow. But when you get to know them you notice... they have a personality. When they have their calves... What a fuss... At night. You can't imagine what it feels like... a little calf. Really warm... and wet. Slippery. From the birth water. There's an awful lot of it. You wouldn't think so. Peschke speaking. Good morning, Dr. Schneider. Where was I? My God. Where was I? My car was stolen... with my cell phone. That's why... She's already arrived? Oh God! Of course. I'll be there at once. I'll be there... I'm extremely sorry, Dr... Shit! Shit! Okay, get up! The good Samaritan has to work... Work! And make it snappy, okay? Oh man. - I have to go. You wait for your friend to come. Don't leave. Thank you. Well, I'll be! He can talk, too. Just in case. B√∂hlke Machinery, Inc. As fast as possible, please. I'm a loser, and I always will be. What a filthy mess! Boy, oh boy. Yeah? ...What? Can't you make an exception? When do we have to leave? ...Shit! Hanna! Get up! C'mon, get up! We gotta go! Hey man. Leave me alone! - It's 10:30. We should've left by 10. Oh no! Was that necessary, Hanna? We missed out on breakfast, too! - Leave me alone! Did you have to empty the bottle? Couldrt you pull yourself together? What's up? - The bottle! C'mon. We gotta get outta here. - Shit! Get up. Be careful. Get dressed. I gotta fix up the room. It's already past 10:30. Wait a sec. - Just cool it. Can you help me... Now it's... Now it's in. The train station is that way. I'm going to the subway. I... I'll take you there. - It's just a few yards. I still got some time. I'm not leaving till this afternoon. I'll look around a bit. It's really different in the big city. - I don't like big goodbyes. Yeah... I'll give you my address. Maybe you'll stop by sometime. - Take care. You can write me sometime! Hey, wake up. Cool... Hey, turn on the music. Hey, music... yeah. Hey, get down from there!
