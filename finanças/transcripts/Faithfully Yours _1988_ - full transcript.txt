Thanks. Let's have a kiss, happy. Ok... Who likes to be the first customer? I'm first... Settle among yourselves. I'm first... Turn around, beautiful. It stinks! Boss, all the flies here will be extinct. Why? Killing flies will be our pastime. Our neighbour will wind-up soon. Over a hundred dollars for a cut! And no shaving! No massage, no ear-cleaning. Only pigheaded ones patrenize that salon. It's real classy. It's ruined! Do it again. Ok. Here you are, sir. Back up 5 feet, at once! Here is where you want. Do as I say, 5 feet no more, no less. Nut! That's incredible. Please take it back. You are a Sage beyond this world? Yes? Where is your consulting office? What's your title? I need your Sage advice? I'm puddin lai, 18th generation of soothsayer lai. If our lines cross, they cross, if not, you loss. When we cross again, I'll give you advice, to get away from misfortune. Sir, why you can't avert this. I leaked heaven's secret for you. I suffered for your sake. Really? Of course. Thank you, Sage. - Sage lai. - Sage lai, thank you. I can smell something evil. Something devilish lurks this direction. Let me charge, charge, charge. - I cut. - Charge. Give a hand. - Charge. - Cut, cut, cut. Hold it, count me out in this game. Charge your ass. Excuse me. Happy look at your hair, what gel do you use? It's ok. The barber next door is devilish! You know! Luckily I got through unscathed. To-day, I averted two misfortunes. Good luck. Oh! Heavens! - What is it? - What? The third misfortune. - What date is it? - The 9th. Do my hair. It's the third misfortune. No on me, but on big eye boy. Congratulations! Grand opening, good business, big money rolling in. Congratulations! Sorry, wrong blessings. No, blessing here, oh, no. No. No... here as well, everywhere as well. In short, good business, big money. Congratulations! Skilful hands. Don't you. I'm not playing. No playing! You did it purposely. Not purposely. That means playing. Shave one eye-brow. Shoot. Come to us, big eye boy. Papa. Not me, he's papa, how you become like this? Why quarrel with these people? Your godfather becomes one eye-brow hero. Your papa never bows to force. My righteous heart yearns for vengeance. Watch my revenge. Bravo. That's great! Bravo. No dead! What are you guys looking at? Lustful eyes. Go inside, ah ying. I'm not through with you yet. Nothing to see! Go inside. So pure and fresh! Fresh! Her eyebrows, nose and forehead... Are auspicious. Ah ying, I'll marry you for sure! Ying, let me apologize to you. Let me say sorry for them. What do the gods say... Will he be alright? Doomed! He's really wretched. This is my year for romance. Sure win! You're spoiled our neighborhood. You are the culprit, you should be the one to settle this. Go and apologize right now. You know what my instinct tells me? What? Don't go. Go fix it, even if you have to pay indemnity. Money! Why not. May be ah ying will be moved by your sincerity. Moved by me? Sure. It is my mistake; Not yours. I should shoulder up this. Right. Go right away. May god be with you. The gods look after you. I pray to you, gods. Hi, uncles, What I mean is... It's an early closure. No, no, I don't mean that. Uncle, I come to apologize to you. - Uncle. - Papa. Papa, please don't. For 19 years, your papa never make one wrong. Shave, not one hair, until today. Look. Shave two eyebrows to pay for mine. What! Two! Uncle, instead of eyebrow, better shave my beard. Or save you the trouble, I pay you money. Thanks. How much? One hundred. Five hundred, for each of you. Not one cent less, or else... Papa, no... Better run. I'll make-up for you. Oh, it looks distorted. No, it links better than the real one. Excellent work. Takes him so long, he is dome for. Probably comes out castrated. He has guts but no wit. He shouldn't flirt with girls. He should realise his weakness. How come... Can't believe my eyes. Bye-bye. Be careful! He looks different. Yes, what is it? Much taller. Ah! Taller. How about this style for your semi-final contest? You like this omega style? Good, good. It is this one then. It's good for mummy. Go got her. Ying, take a rest. Have some refreshments. Mum, don't disrupt us. It's not up to 30 minutes yet. You want her to die exhausted. I say, take a rest. Don't you want her to become miss Hong Kong. The prize is one million dollars. Moreover, she can marry a rich guy. Papa, what is important for my husband is: I love him and he loves me; not necessarily a rich guy. Right, greedy man! Don't you use ying to make money. Woman's mentality. Welcome. Yes. Sir, please. Smelly bean curds. What's up? Come! On the house. Uncle! I'm sure you like this. You too. Have some chilli sauce. Help yourself. This is the most smelly. Uncle, I've come to apologize... And have shampoo. So as to hear from you. Don't hurry. Help yourself. Ying, try one. No, thank you. Oh, you don't like it. Shampoo, this way. Is... she... coming... I'm honored, you do it yourself. Ah fu. It's yours. Shampoo? Your hand! Come align. That way. Ah ying. Go, go. Uncle, I present you this fortune tiger. It's will bring you big money. Is my business bad now? Your business is surely brisk. But money is never too much, right? Where shall we place this fortune tiger? This is a vantage point. Good for money. Son, here is good for money, no good for sex. Uncle, you have good sense of humor. In fact, I come to apologise. And have a shampoo as well. Shampoo over there, pay here. Shampoo? Make-up eyebrow. Make-up eyebrow. Uncle, ying, these flowers are for... I like flowers. Specially for you, uncle. - Ying.. - Don't you want a shampoo? Go. Don't touch my thing. I'll have a shampoo first. Let's go. - Are your place of work nearby? - Yes. - Trust off-duty? - Yes. Of course off-duty, it is so late. Why don't you patronize grassy salon next door? Don't mention the grassy salon, uncle. It's a mess. They pull and pluck your hair. You lost many hair in 1 shampoo. Really? - Uncle, it is true. - Really? - Many people say so. - Is it? Bull shit. Your friend seems quite exaggerating. He is always like that. Always boast and brag. What? But, this time he speaks the truth. I know, I know. Don't you move, are you a baby. You talk foul behind you friend's back. Not unethical, just face the facts. Grassy, what a lousy name. Talk of skill, can't compare with your Shanghai. - You agree? - Of course. Uncle when you see our hair-dresser friend. Ask him which is better: Grassy or Shanghai? He'll surely say: Shanghai. Shut up! You pigs! Rats! So, there you are! Good! Now, be honest; is Shanghai better than grassy? - Is it? - Dare you say "no"! No no... I mean yes. You see! Uncle. You see I was right. Sit down. Well, since you three are so appreciative, I myself will make the hairdo for you. So nice, uncle. Thank you, ying. Hey, no entry. You! Ungrateful pig! You, unthankful rat. Get lost! Cool it! Just let us in as customers. Alright? Don't take it so serious. Just now we were joking. Right. You should take jokes lightly. Why make jokes! What a hairdo! Get inside. You look grotesque. Is the Shanghai barber misinforming you. Not a trace of ah ying. I gave the barber 100 bucks, he was so happy. Is it false information. No! I dreamed of auspicious signs last night. I am sure of romance... Ah ying. - Ah ying... - What a coincidence... - It's your Shanghai barber... - No, it is our stars. Ying, are they your relatives? No, they are pupils of my class. I coach them swimming during holidays. - Let's warm up. - Good. Please teach us. Let's have fun together. Good. One, two, three... Look, they're doing it all wrong. They just stare at the teacher. Who knows what they're thinking. I know what you are thinking. You do? You want to "dab" ah ying. What do you mean "dab"? "Dab" means say hello to her. Is that right? Yes... Thanks, I got it. They're cheating the teacher again. Yes. Students... Let's practise breathing now. Good... Miss, I don't know how to breathe. Alright, I'll teach you. Let me do it for you. Hi, kid. This guy doesn't know how to breathe. That's it. It's simple. I can hold one breath for an hour. Just half an hour! For one breath, I can swim across the harbour. Liar. Don't cheat a child. - Right. - It's all talk and no action. Right. Can you do it? Why not! Go ahead. Let's test our endurance. Let's see who will die of exhaustion. We will have a race. Children, you'll be our judges. Good! Oki ying, you be umpire. Alright, let us watch them. Miss, I wish to see if they break rules. Right, go ahead. They breathe out beautiful bubbles. Really. Miss. What? They speak vulgar language. How can you hear in water? They growl at each other. Miss. How is it? They must be thirsty. Why? They drink at big gulps. Really? Teacher... yes? They look like fish in my aquarium. How do they like? With protruding eyes. How are they? Don't press, children! Want any drinks? Oh, no! No! No! Ying! You do enjoy coaching swimming? I love children and it is summer vacation. I can keep fit as well. Next month is the miss Hong Kong contest... Miss Hong Kong. I qualified for the semi-final. How nice! I am an insurance agent, I can help you to make the right decision. You look very smart. Just like a royalty. Hold on, let me do it with precision... You have used too much of your hands. The same old trick? Let you take a through look at ying. You'll ruin my reputation. Who ask you to take advantage. He's a scum. That's his nature. He's always like that. Ying, I'm ki ho yan. I'm chan hoi sum. You can call me big eye. Remember me. I'm studying fashion design. I'll be a hair stylist. I can design an evening gown for you. I can design the perfect hair style for you. Let me help you. Hey, here is five bucks for you. Don't let me pay the bill. Ok. Trust me for a new hair style. Let's go. Bill please. Yes. Here... thanks... Let me... No, I must pay. Please don't. Hey, don't grip so tight, I can't shuffle. It's my turn. Why don't you pay. You seldom pay. What now? It means I pay! Why ask stupid question. Do I have to pay you back? Keep the change! Yes, keep the change. Thank you, sir. Ah ying. It's for you, uncle. Next time, no flowers just cash. I considered the whole night. And decided... Keep calm! To offer you this. Good for you? Only two men in the world are fit for it; one is stallon, the other one is you. Really? What stal... Stallon, Rambo! Great swordsmanship! Yeah! It's sharp. He said Rambo used it. It is highly lethal! Touching it is disastrous! You saw it. Real sharp. It's sharp. It cuts into your wallet. I know, I've got 200 bucks only. Even one eyebrow is worth 500. I've got a blank check, I'll fill in there. It send chills to your back. It does. I go first. Nut! Not so chilly now! Daughter! Are you fond of these three? No, we just met a few times. Right. Our daughter won't like common folks. Papa, please! Then, why did you invite them to dinner? To manipulate them. They flirt with ah ying. With different excuses. I'll make use of the three dogs. To help ying in the beauty contest. What, three dogs! What do you take your daughter for? Well, let the dogs watch each other! Coming! Hi, ah ying. You're come! Uncle! Private collection. You'll like it. Oh, really. This is for you, uncle. This is the most expensive one. It's just a little gift. Give it to ying. Take care of it. Ying, take care of it. Come in and sit down. Honey, ready for dinner. Uncle, it's a beautiful house. Uncle, I... Auntie. My name is puddin lai, ying must always mention me. Yes, you are the hair-dresser, right! Is business good? So so. Auntie, it smells good.

Ying, let's go in. No hurry, some other day. I tried many brands of shampoo. Can't decide the right one for my hair. Can you help me? Sure. They are dry hair. You are right, you see they split. Quite many splits. Yes. Split, split, split on your dead body. Who is dead? Oh! Your palm marks escape form death. Which results in big riches. That's better. Yes. It's all right.

My son is so naughty. Careful! My dear boy, two more months. You will come and decide our fate. Hands off! By that time, two fragile hearts... Will be broken. Don't worry, I'll give you some glue. To mend them. Mend your skull. In fact, all three of you are gentlemen. Hard-working, reliable, and smart! When I marry one of you. Will you still be good friends? We've listened to you. We are good friends all along? Yes, quite good. Wow, wow your mother! Her mother is a bitch, don't you spare her? What kind of man are you? Ying, you know what he is like. Old man, I am nervous.

Male and female. Which are these? This... english; What does it say? This is odd, all are a type! All the gods in heaven. It must be a son. So I expect. Thanks for taking care of ah ying so far, how about christening for my son. You're dreaming. How about plum lai. Plum stone. Mammy! Mammy is here. Son or girl? What is it? Does it look like me? Of the same blood type? Mammy, tell us. Mammy, tell us please. It's a son. Wow, great. I knew it! It's an illegitimate son. Pa sold it to godfather. Sold my son! Going to Canada tomorrow. Take it back. Godfather has money and power. Don't fancy taking it back. Mammy? Go away! Mammy! What, now? We must stick together for once. Ok. United. Nut! Come on... Milk for you, son.

Big eye boy. Big eye boy, you are the kindest, so devoted to ying. Marrying you, make me feel secure. Woman! Hold it. Until there is the flat. 60 tables, 1/2 a million dollars, you can meet only once a month. Shut up! Have the wedding next month. The number of tables doesn't matter. Really, mother? Any complaint? No! Come with me. Son, call your daddy. Call daddy. Lost the last minute. Heaven's will! You're lucky. Big eye. You two cheer up. You're still good friends. Right! Of course.
