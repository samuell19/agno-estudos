Her legs are very thin from her knees down. That's why she uses sticks to support herself. She has a dream. "If my legs were to recover, I would run over a crosswalk in pink rain boots..." "...as soon as the light turned green." "And I would keep the sticks rather than throw them away." "I would make them longer and lend them if someone had legs worse than mine." "If someone had shorter legs, I would make them shorter and lend them." "I would run over a crosswalk with an umbrella when the light turned green." Yakko has never worn rain boots since she was born. And she has been admitted with Toshimitsu for surgery to lengthen her Achilles tendons. I was desperate, thinking about the anxious feeling before surgery. Yakko, don't be scared! It's not scary. Not even a tiny bit. I will be with you during surgery. Pick up the pink flower. That's right. Are you going to put it on your head? Ah! You are buying the same pink rain boots. Buying them... Don't be scared. When the black anesthetic mask comes onto you, just breathe in and out deepl y. When you do it, they will cast a magic spell on you. It's not scary when you are under it. I will be looking at you during surgery. Don't be scared. Don't be scared. Don't be scared. Don't be scared. Hey, I promised you. We would run to the beach when your legs get better. Right? Last year's Christmas... You promised, right? That this Christmas, you'd walk again. Yakko... Toshimitsu... And then, after surgery, you will get casts on your legs. And then, they will take them off later, and you will train hard. Surgical Room And then, they will take them off later, and you will train hard. And then, they will take them off later, and you will train hard. After that, you will be able to walk. Toshimitsu, don't be scared. Breathe in and out. In and out... In and out... In and out... It's not scary at all, right? Don't be scared. See? It's over. You'll be fine. Toshimitsu... Yakko... Ah... where did you two go? With that white dress, you look like a bride. And Toshimitsu... looks like a groom. You got out of the Hospital? The little bride and groom. Toshimitsu collects pink flowers and gives them to her. Yakko looks happy. Hydrotherapy To celebrate the discharge from the Hospital, Toshimitsu plays with a baby in a department store. 2 years ago? Ah, last year's summer... 2 years ago? Ah, last year's summer... Orthopedic Surgeon Masaya Kawabata Orthopedic Surgeon Masaya Kawabata The size of the wheelchair... Ah, this is the current one... This is a heavy one. From this, I think he is balancing his body relatively well when he pushes the chair... He even uses the repulsive force. He cannot yet make accurate movements with his hands though. - Hello. - Hello. Come here. From there, move that way. Take off your socks. Check-Up Raise your knee and hold. Yes, look at that! How does it look? Hey, make your ankle like this. Stand up. Raise your leg. - She cannot. - Ah, you cannot. Why? Why are you nervous? - Wait for a bit. - Yes, yes. This seems to be the problem. It won't work that way. - It starts hurting. - Ah, does it hurt? Wait for a bit. Raise your knee and hold. Please wait for a bit. Squat for a bit. Squat for a bit. - Why? - Yes. - Still standing without supports looks unstable. - That's right. I can see that the left-right balance is imperfect. But it depends on how he will do. That kind of movement always has a potential risk. - He must learn how to do it more properly. Right? - Yes. He tries to move like that even after getting off from the wheelchair, right? And how much can he do? Good luck!
