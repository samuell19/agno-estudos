Thief! Catch him! Thief! Hey you..stop! Thief... Oh God! Thou art the Giver of Life... Thief..Thief... Come on Ghanta! Catch him..Thief...! Come on Ghanta! Thief... Thief! Hey...Stop...Witch..! "Hey, come out!" "You come in...Come on, Come on!" Thief.. Thief.. - He has gone inside. That's great! I hope the witch turns him into a dog! He pilfered from the temple donation box. Heretic! Sinner! Madame Witch! Madame Witch! Please turn him into a donkey. He has pinched too many clothes from the riverbank I say turn that crook into a hen. It will be a pleasure to slice off his head gently. He's just a little child. The poor thing is ignorant. "Aha! Masterji! So he's a little child, eh!" Then why don't you go inside and teach him a few lessons. The witch too might get educated! I don't believe in any ghosts or witches. And it is not mine but the job of the police to catch and send him to a Remand Home. Ghanta... Masterji has a point If the police don't catch the thief then who will. "No, No Mukhiyaji, that Spider Witch does no discrimination between" ...cops and robbers. No matter whoever goes in comes out an animal. And if you guys are so passionate about catching the thief then why doesn't someone accompany us in? Say what Phuttan? Punditji? Say what Kallu! I heard he stole six hens from your shop. Come on will you. Country peasants want to take on the law. Is there anyone with the guts to go inside? Is there? There is. I shall go in. "Chunni, listen. I'll tell father. - Shut up, you sissy pest!" The witch is inside. - Come on. Come on it's nothing. "What happened? It's nothing. Come on, don't be scared." Come out. Nobody will harm you. We will let you go. Come out. Don't be scared. Come out. No one dare enter The Spider's web For Shadows are hungry In the Spider's web Trapped in her cluches trapped in her teeth There is no escape "Stay away, stay away." The night sniffs fresh blood As it wanders like a jackal Webs hang from windows Reeking of flies The twisted feet of the witch. Just who do you think you are! "Madho, Munni has cooked the eggs really well today." "Grandma, Peas look like gourds to you and gourd curry like egg curry." "Really, ask Munni. - Don't change the subject Chunni." "Father, ask her why did she go inside that Witch-house?" Masterji told us the Science does not believe in any ghosts or witches. "So, where do you think today's thief went?" "And what about The Cobbler's daughter, Phattu, Kallan eh?" And don't they say that the witch turned Tulsi's daughter into a hen! "Madho, I suggest that we also keep a hen in the house." The doctor told me that an egg a day would be excellent for my eyesight. Ugh! Why does the Buttermilk taste like water? Because this is water not Buttermilk. What happened Mugale Azam? - I'm hungry. Here. My God! I haven't seen such huge toffees in my whole life! Don't you sweet talk with me. Just eat. "So, why didn't you get anything to eat today." I couldn't wash the hencoop today. "l don't feel like going even to the loo so early in the morning," how does he expect me wash the coop! Tell me this. Why did you make that Butcher your father. He adopted me when I was still a little child. "So you are grown up now, right! Jump out of his shadow." He wants not a son but a servant... ... who can wash his hencoops all his life for free. That's it. Enough. - A little bit more. "lf you want more, you'll have to do something for me." What? - My homework! Where had you been? Witch-house. Tell me the truth or I shall tell Father. "Shut up, you sissy pest." I shall make a hen out of you and give it to Kallu. Won't he love to chop your head off "Shak, shak, shak." A razor makes a barber And the knife a butcher "The job, however, is simply to cut" "And helpless is your brother. What can be done?" O what can be done? "No one likes to die, sister" No one likes to die Dear Sister My hens are so dear to me And oh! So delicious "They sway their red crowns to the beat" And rhythmically peck at grain "Go on, get nice and fat" "Eat away, my plump darling" "Eat away, it gladdens my heart" Eat away -- its good for my health "But ah! no one likes to die, sister" "Oh my dear, you are so gorgeous" "And oh, so intelligent" "And your lush feathers, all yellow and blue" so well groomed without oil and comb "lts amazing how you settle on an egg, and lo! behold, out comes a chick" "Oh, my dear hen, you are sheer magic" Gracious! You are simply amazing Pecking away at grain and laying eggs "But no one likes to die, dear sister!" "Hurry up Chunni, We're getting late for school." "Hurry up, please. - Coming." Did you brush your teeth? "At least try not to waste water, Masterji tells us..." That there are several countries in the world where people don't even get water to drink. Shut up you sissy pest. Tata! Money Where is Munni? - She got up so late. Still bathing. "Listen, I am going to the city for four days." "l don't want any complaints when I return, okay!" "Okay. Father, what shall you get for me from the city?" A cane to hit you. - Okay. "Hi, Munni!" "Father, Money." Here. I am going to the city to sell toys. Take care of that little witch while I'm gone. Sure. Should I get something for you from the city? "Sure, a cane. - What??" An egg! A hen's egg... for Grandma's eyesight. All right. We shall keep a hen in the house when I return. Go. "Father, Money." Chunni! "You have done the homework yourself, right?" Really Masterji. Swear on Munni. Well done. Come on Munni Popatlal. Excellent. - Thank you Masterji. You have to become a great woman someday. "Come on who's next. Please come, Mr. Mugale Azam." "What's this. Incomplete homework, today as well." I'm sure you have complete meals everyday... then why is your homework always in complete. If there is a problem then please let me know. Tell me Mugale Azam. Why are you so quiet? Why is your homework incomplete? Go and squat like a rooster in the corner. Go now. Come on who's next. School's over! How...! Chunni!! Hey Munni! Time for some fun. What happened? So you lost your money. "Don't worry, have some from mine." "No, No...Not this way." There can be no gain without some pain. What? I don't feel like doing my homework today. You shall achieve hell for such sins. I shall die of hunger but will never abet you in your wrongdoings. Never. "Think about it carefully. It's your decision, really." "Chunni, shall I do your homework today?" "No, Munni shall do it. Only Munni." Hey Aladdin. Come on. "Here, have it." "Hey, I gave the lce cream for you to eat Mugale Azam..." not for that dog. - Aladdin is my brother. Just like Kallu had adopted me. I've adopted this little one. "He is my best friend, Aladdin's magical lamp." "What are you thinking about, Chunni?" Doesn't the Witch get bored sitting all alone the whole day in the House? Hmmm...I was wondering what does the poor thing get to eat? "Aw come on, you don't even know this!" She's got the biggest Pancake in the world. Shut up "Come on, you. You don't believe me right! Come." "No, No, I am not coming! - Think about it, fatso." "Aladdin! Aladdin! Don't go inside, Aladdin." "The witch inside. Aladdin, come back." Go get my ball from inside Kallu. "You are the hero of the village, aren't you?" Go get it yourself. You scrawny lizard! Why did you throw my ball inside? Mugale Azam. Hey...Scrawny Lizard! Aladdin! Don't Cry Mugale Azam. He'll come back! Aladdin! No... Nobody has ever returned from there! Where is the book? Where has she kept it? What do you want Mugale Azam? - Food! "It's time to teach you a lesson, Kallu." "Try dancing to this tune, Kallu." Now run behind your hens through the village. "Push harder, fatso. - I'm pushing as hard as I can." "Listen, hey loser, don't mess with me" "Slap you so hard, don't mess with me" Just don't mess with me "Or I'll twist your little finger till it swells like a thumb Get it?" "I'm the one who turns the wheels of the world" "With my little schemes I run the show" "Believe me buddy, I'm creme de la creme" "Come with me buddy, and we'll rock the world" But don't mess with me "Or I'll roll you and flatten you like pizza dough, get it?" "I'm for real, I'm a hoax, yeah. I'm a con" "Here, eat my thumb, I do as I please" "Chunni now, and lo! I'm Munni" "And from Munni, back to Chunni" "A little straight, a little twisted" So don't mess with me "Cause I can turn a kitten into a goat" "Chunni and Mugale Azam, time for bloodshed!" "ls this a joke, Munni?" "l had done the homework, Masterji!" "Now you too have started lying to me, Munni!" "No, Masterji. I am telling the truth. God Promise." Chunni. Chunni. When did the war of Panipat begin? What Masterji? What was the kingdom of Porus called? The kingdom of Porus... er...was...er "So, now you have started thieving as well, eh!" No Masterji...I was Go and squat like a rooster in the corner. "l can't squat like a rooster, Masterji!" Why? - Because I can squat like a hen. "Shut up, you idiot. Go in the corner." Shut up. School's over! What! You let my hens free in the whole village. Want to mess with Kallu! "Mugale Azam, Where is Mugale Azam." "Hey fatso, you saved my life. Thank you." What's up! Why do you look like a rotten pumpkin. Hey Gotcha Chunni! - Bye Uncle. God bless you. "Now only God's blessings can save you, Chunni Madam." "But I am Munni, Uncle. - Munni!" "Chunni has gone towards that garden road, that one, that" "Hey, Mugale Azam!" "Today in the science class, Masterji taught us that in the world..." "What happened? - Munni, run. Run hard, Munni." Oh my god! "How far will you go, chunni? I'll get hold of you." "Father, that's Munni. - But you are Mugale Azam, right?" "Hey, gotcha...the witch, the witch house." Run for your life. Go inside. "Munni, don't go inside. Come back Munni. Munni..." If you come outside I shall cut you to pieces. You have lots of love for your father's enemy. Shall I cut you too! Hey look at that! There it goes. Chunni! - What happened! What happened! "Munni, Munni...Munni has gone inside the Witch house." What? "Phuttan uncle, Phuttan uncle... - What's up?" "Phuttan Uncle, Munni has gone inside the Witch house." "But you can't fool me this time, Chunni." "Punditji, Munni has gone inside the Witch-house." Do something. Please do something. O Lord! Can you believe this liar? How can you expect this ailing man to help you? "Child, why don't you go to the Police Station?" You don't cry. You... You don't worry. I am there for your right? I shall go and fetch Banta right now. You go towards the Witch-house. I shall come with Banta there "And listen, no matter what happens, you don't go inside...okay?" Munni! "Who are you looking for, little child?" Have you seen my sister? I have! Munni? She went into a slumber... waiting for you all day. She is beneath the red cloth. "Munni, look who has come to see you." "Come here, come on you." "Munni, look Chunni has come to see you. Come on wake up." Munni! Munni! What...Please forgive me. You turn me into an animal but please spare my sister. She is completely innocent. She came in here because of fear... Fear! Humans tread into this mansion not for fear but for greed. For the greed of the treasure... The clothes and ornaments of our ancestors mean... only riches to you greedy people I have been protecting the honour of my ancestors for aeons. And till the elements exist nothing can take away this honour from us "For centuries I have been ravenous, for centuries I have been thirsting." "l shall do whatever you ask me to. - Oh, really?" Tell me. What can you do for me? - Anything. Whatever you ask of me I only ask you to leave Munni in return. So you want Munni instead of the hen... then in exchange for Munni you get me hens. "Tell me, how many hens can you feed me?" "As many as you ask me to. 1, 2, 5, 10, 20." Shut up! "l am a witch hungry for a hundred years," "l want at least a hundred hens. No more, no less." But don't worry. I don't want them all at once. Get them for me everyday after sunset but before sunrise. The day you complete the quota of one hundred hens... I shall turn the hen back to Munni. But if you dare tell this to anyone then you will have to feed... "on your sister's eggs all your life, remember this." "So, from this day, you shall be both Chunni and Munni..." for the rest of the world. Uncle! Munni! "Oh Munni! Where did you go missing, Munni?" "Munni, we have sitting here waiting all night." Munni! Chunni simply vanished after making us sit here. Glory to the lord for sending this little child back in one piece... from the Witch house. Oh Lord! I shall make an offering in the temple. Whose hen is this? - This is not a hen! Was it a rooster? Mother! Mother Hey Mother! What happened mother? - Oh my son! Why are you crying? Both the kids are missing since last night. What are you saying mother! I'm telling the truth. My little babies. People are saying that both of them have gone inside the Witch house. What mother! The Witch house! Stop crying mother! Grandma! Where had you been? Are you all right? Don't cry grandma. I am here. - My child. Little Chunni. "Mother, this is Munni, Not Chunni. Look at the mole." "Oh yes! This is Munni. Where is Chunni, little child?" "She's very scared, father. Please don't scold her." Do you think I'm a butcher? You kids are the two pieces of my heart. I shall die if anyone goes away. "Don't ever go close to that house, again." She won't - Whose hen is this? Chunni and me have bought her from our savings for Grandma. The doctor says that an egg a day is very good for grandma's eyesight. "Tunni! Shall we name her Tunni, your third sister?" "Munni, please forgive me." "Once you become human again," I swear I shall never play pranks on anybody. "l will have to go now, okay? Don't worry! I'll come back soon." I have got a cane to hit you from the city. "Come on, get ready for lunch, come." I have cooked the chicken specially for you kids. Here have this leg-piece. What happened? "Got it, you're saving the piece for Munni isn't it!" Where is she? - She's upstairs What's she doing? Homework. She'll have lunch after homework. Does she want to become lndira Gandhi in a day! "Munni! O Munni! - Grandma, Grandma. I'll call her." "No, you have lunch. I'll call her. - No, father. I'll call her." "No, kid. You have your food. I'll call her." Munni! Munni! Little child. Why do you study so much. Oh no! This darn nail. "Munni, get me hammer." I've told Mother time and again to get this fixed by the carpenter but she never listens to me. "Oh, come on out." "Munni. Come on kid, time for food... hey what happened?" Why are you panting so much? - Panting? I'm practicing for an athletic competition in my school. What's wrong with your cheek? - Nothing Then why have you kept your hand on it? Oh yes? I've got a terrible toothache. - Open your mouth. Show it to me. Which is that terrible tooth hurting my little child. Let's go to the doctor - It's all right now. "Okay then, come have lunch with us. - I'm not hungry father." "Come on child, I've cooked chicken especially for you" "No father, I'm not hungry at all!" "Okay, if you don't eat then I won't too" "Munni! You are Munni, right?" "No, I'm her aunty" You've started speaking correctly! But I have been speaking correctly ever sicne I was a kid That witch let you go? "Munni, shall I buy this pumpkin? - Yes." Give me the pumpkin. - Even I am very fond of pumpkins. "Good morning, Masterji" And if Munni cooks it then I shall have it too. I warned Kallu that if he dares to scare any child I'll have him arrested. "Munni, didn't you find the Witch inside that house." Haven't you taught us that witches and ghosts don't exist. "They do, Munni." Now look at your sister. Isn't she a real life witch! 13 minus 7 equals 5... 1 1 multiplied by 1 1 You find the very funny don't you. Have a good laugh "I'm a bad girl right? I deserve this, don't l!" I have to steal hens from Kallu's place everyday for the witch "God, please help me complete her demand of 100 hens..." so that my little sister can be human once again. Want a sip? - No! This is the blood of a hawk. It'll give you strength. Shall I go? Hang around. Have the chicken with me No Okay. Go. And listen... give my love to Munni And tomorrow... Only Science provides us with true knowledge. How do things exist? And why don't certain phenomenon exist? And how will those events occur that need to occur and... how to stop those that need to be stopped? Therefore.. science provides us with concrete evidence. Every action and reaction... Chunni... "These stories of ghosts, ghouls and witches are mere superstition." Chunni. Come early tonight. I am very hungry. Chunni! - Yes. What are you staring at outside? - Outside there.. There l... Did you do your homework? - What! "l asked, did you do your homework? - Yes, I did." When did Vasco Da Gama come to lndia? - 1498 (a+b} whole square? 'a' square+'b' square+2ab Excellent! Why didn't Munni come today? She is going to be absent for the next 10 days What happened? - A dog has bitten her. Whose dog? There is a mad dog in our lane. He bites everybody... Poor Munni! All right.. I shall come to your house tomorrow after my morning walk Sir! I'll have tea with you... the one with ginger. Sit down. Oh God! It bit me! The dog bit me! "Help me, I've been bitten hard on my leg." You bark well. He eats so much. - Shall I ask you a question. Now what? - Where is Munni? Which dog has bitten her and if you lied then why did you lie? Don't waste time thinking. Just eat. Hey my beautiful! Where did you go my lovely? What is it? - This isn't yours? I'm the only butcher in 5 villages. If you find a razor... ...it belongs to the barber and if you find a hen... "Kallu, It's mine!" Then who does it belong to? To the Butcher! Have your last sip of water! "Hey, stop! You! - What!" Don't even try to cross the limits. - The hen belongs to me. "Don't cry, child. Don't you cry. Each drop of your tear is like pearl" The hen really belongs to me... Ask the hen "Don't cry, Chunni. No matter who troubles you, we shall not spare him." "Yes, be it anybody" "Yes, be it this butcher or be it the Witch." "A little boat Floating like the moon" "A little boat Floating away..." "The day sets slowly, mother And I grow afraid" The day flees and hides In a dark house somewhere "Dark night arrives, the night of dread" "Dark night, the night of dread" Dear Mother Night falls like a Spider's web With gnarled hands and long nails Frightened and hiding I search for somewhere safe But darkness falls over me And clutches me in its claws "Dark night, the night of dread" Wriggling on my neck like a bug "That I cannot crush, that crushes me" "Save me from this ordeal, mother" Save me from this black curse "Who knows what tomorrow has in store" I dread tomorrow's twilight "And dark night, the night of dread" Hey... who is it? Who is it? "lt is nobody! Why do shout unnecessarily, nobody's there." Go to sleep. I shall cut you tomorrow. "Oh, the box fell. Now you hens go to sleep." You shall be cut tomorrow. So once again you come empty handed! "No aunty, I've got something else today" What is this? - Toffee. What? Try to taste it. You might like it. Not this way. You open the wrapper outside and eat the inside part. Not bad! What do you call it? Toffee fee... Toffee? Should I get 100 of these instead of the hens? Yes! Definitely! Then I too shall give you a toad instead of Munni. Think about it. Kallu has smelt a rat aunty. He sits guarding his hens all night. "How is it my fault, tell me?" You've managed only 7 hens in the last 15 days. At such a pace your sister shall become a very old woman. Remember this! "Grandma, have you seen my hen anywhere?" Don't know. Kallu too was asking about her in the morning Who? - Kallu. That foul butcher. Hey... what happened Chunni? Why are you crying? Where is Kallu? - Why are you crying? He's gone to the next village to fetch hens. Will you tell me what's wrong? How many hens has he cut since morning? None... Why? Did he get any new hen... in the morning? "Tomorrow is Mushtaq's marriage, right?" So he is collecting hens for the party. He gets a few everyday. I want my Munni back. He is collecting hens not Munnis. What's going on? Will you tell me? How many hens to go? 92 What... There are 93 in the shop which means 92 real hens... and the last one Munni - So... "Push a little harder, Chunni. We'll be in big trouble if caught." I'm trying my best. You hardly paid any attention to whatever I taught you. "But if what you say is true, then the activities inside..." this house are dangerous for the entire village. I shall go in... "No, Masterji. We'll come in with you." "No, you'll go the Police Station and get Ghanta and Banta here." "But, Masterji.... - Go now..." Uncle! "Banta, we will have to be very careful" "Chunni, what you have done has pained our heart." If I knew I would have torn that Witch into pieces. What happened? How would you have done that? By your mere hands? Oh No! We forgot our guns in the Police Station. Oh God! You kids go towards the house. We'll be there pronto. "And listen, no matter what happens, don't go inside...Okay?" It's been hours. When will they be here? There is no clue about Masterji. Even the hens are missing. Should we go in? - No way! Aunt... "Tell me what you want to turn into," "a toad, a bird, an earthworm or a snake." Please forgive me Aunty. There is no forgiveness for deceit in the realm of the witch. It's no fault of mine. I am innocent. Innocent! Your spy had come here. He is our teacher. - Not any more. You found your hens. Please make Munni a human being. You will have to be punished for the deceit. Please forgive me Aunt. 100 Goats 100 goats. How can I get them all alone? You should have thought about it before trying to cheat me. Get lost! Hey... hang on. Take your teacher along with you. "Masterji, what's happened to you Masterji?" He shall teach you now... the knowledge of science. "What happened, Chunni?" She's very angry. Has asked me for 100 goats. Where will I find 100 goats? "Look, what she has done to our Masterji." Masterji? Aladdin.. this is Aladdin! Aladdin! Science is what provides us with real knowledge. How do things exist? And why don't certain phenomenon exist? "These stories of ghosts, ghouls and witches are mere superstition." "lf this is Aldadin, not Masterji." Then that hen couldn't have been Munni. Which means that the Witch isn't a Witch. Hey come on in. Don't be afraid. - I'm not. What's that? Throw the torchlight. It's Masterji's watch. Oh yes! What's this? Masterji's stick! Yes! What's that? - Masterji's cap! Look! Look! Hey Chunni! So it's you! And you've got a friend along with you. No.. aunt... my friend got those hens for you... I wanted to ask when should I get the goats. What's his name? Mu... Mu... Mugale Azam. Mugale Azam! That's a good name. Wow! Look who has come to visit us! Uncle! Uncle! She is the witch. Don't be afraid! She's our aunt. Come... come alone. No uncle... no... Come on... Come on. "Munni, you're alive!" Munni.. are you alright? Everything will be alright. We'll find them. "How will we find them, Mukiyaji! Ghanta and Banta are missing." There is no news of Masterji. And my Mugale Azam. He too is missing. "Mukhiyaji, you please inform the Collector in the city." "That'll result in a calamity, Mukhiyaji!" All this is the result of the Witch's wrath. We cannot make her angrier. We cannot risk the life of all the villager for 3 or 4 people 3 or 4 people are missing today. Tomorrow it could be us or our kids. Do you want us to watch the whole thing quielty? "No, we will have to sacrifice a goat in Goddess Kali's temple." No. What sacrifice! Mukhiyaji.. "Look Kallu, the witch is very angry..." "You shut up! Mukhiyaji, you go to the city..." call the police and search that witch house. This sacrifice story will do nothing for us "No matter who went there, came out an animal." "Am I right, brothers? - Yes!" "What do you mean, yes.." he... he has returned... Iook at him... my dear Aladdin. "You bring me great luck, Chunni." Today I shall be rewarded for my unshakeable dedication. "Hey, carry on digging or else the witch shall turn you all into rats!" These villagers are real dimwits. Such a rare treasure is buried in their own backyard and these people don't have a clue. "Only if your uncle were alive today, he would have been such a proud man." Our uncle was in the Archaeological Department. After years of research he found out that an ancient statue... is buried somewhere in the palace of Sitapur. But before he could inform the the government... Aunty made sure that he was buried somewhere in his own house. Aunty... you are great! That's enought Go and get me something to eat! Yes aunty! "For centuries I have been ravenous, for centuries I have been thirsting." Water! Water! Munni... Munni... what happened Have some pity on these little children. They have been digging continously for the past 18 hours. The digging won't stop till that statue is found. Please give some water. You'll get nothing till the statue is found. Keep on digging Masterji or else Munni will die. Aunty! "lt is the blood of a Hawk, Chunni. Want a sip?" No. I've spiked it with crow's blood too. No. This is bat's blood. "This is grape juice, you silly!" "You are no less than an invaluable statue, Chunni" Haven't you been feeding us such delicious hens for so many days We would have died of hunger if it wasn't for you I knew that you will do anything to save Munni. "You will thieve, lie and even rob." That is why I spared you from this drudgery. This statue has sacrificed so many little children. I have lost count of how many in the last 5 years. But no one as clever as you. Move over! Hurry up. Get it out quickly! Will get at least a million for it Rupees? "Dollars, you idiot!" Hey! Dollars!! Dollars! What will happen to the kids aunt? The same thing that happened to your uncle. Aunt! Don't do this to us aunty! This statue has sacrificed so many lives. Don't leave them. Beat them up. Who are you? - Leave my way! The kids! Where are the kids! I asked you to leave my way! Move aside! Move aside! - Have you kidnapped the children! ">From the Archaeological Department, for the development of the entire village." "By freeing the village from all superstitious beliefs, Chunni has" put up a shining example of courage and scientific temperament. Chunni is a boon from the Goddess above! The village will get recognition in the whole world. Chunni is now the heroine of the village. "Hey Chunni, you are the heroine of the village." "And my Mugale Azam, I will love you more than my own blood." I swear on Allah. I am ashamed of my deeds. "Now with you all present, I ask forgiveness from Chunni." Chunni... Chunni has opened up my eyes... Chunni... this Chunni has... Chu.. Chunni... hey!
