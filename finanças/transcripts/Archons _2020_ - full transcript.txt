Six tonight to cast your votes, okay? If you don't get your votes in, you don't get a chance to win, simple as that. If you're just joining me, then you missed it. I just sat down with the guys from Tone Shark, who talked influence, inspiration, and favorite local hangouts. If you missed it or wanna hear it again, don't worry. The whole interview will be up on the XMFM website by the time you're home from work. Tone Shark is playing the Orpheum tonight. There are still plenty of tickets for sale, but don't wait. XMFM 92.9. We've got a big night ahead of us. Tonight you will hear my interview with rock sensation Sled Dog. Later on the hour I'll be playing new music from Over Oleander. But before any of that, legendary guitarist of Blackwater Doug Taylor will be joining me, answering your questions live. Stick around, you won't want to miss it. Keep your radio tuned to XMFM 92.9. Speaking of Sled Dog, here's the song that put them on the map. The song you know and love, this is "Backfire". ♪ Been here before ♪ ♪ Too many times ♪ ♪ What's one more ♪ ♪ Is there something ♪ ♪ To fan two flames ♪ ♪ Or are we left with nothing ♪ ♪ We can save ♪ ♪ Why ♪ ♪ Do we even try ♪ ♪ When every time ♪ ♪ Our love will backfire ♪ Ahoy there. Ahoy there, Captain. Fine afternoon, isn't it? They don't get much finer. I hope you don't mind me saying this, but you three look absolutely stunning today. Do you mind if I stop here for a breather? Heading down the river? Yeah, if my friends ever catch up. That them? Oh yeah, there they are. I was starting to worry I'd lost them. You ladies have a lovely spot here. It's a hidden gem. Don't go telling anyone about it. Oh, your secret's safe with me. I wouldn't know who to tell anyway, I'm not from around here. Where you from? Born in Elfros, Saskatchewan, raised in Saskatoon, and currently living in Toronto. Well welcome to BC. You're too kind. Long way from home for a canoe trip. Oh, the canoe trip's just a bonus. We're in Vancouver for a show. - What show? - Sled Dog. Hey, I was there, too. "Backfire" was the first album I ever bought. Yeah? Oh my, oh my god, you're, you're Mitch Hoffman, you're Mitch Hoffman! At your service. You're so amazing. "Backfire" was the ringtone on my phone for like three years. Oh, please. Can we get a selfie? Yeah, yeah, of course. Oh my god, wait. Those your bandmates? Yeah, yeah, that's them. Can you sign my CD and my shirt? You weren't kidding. Absolutely. What's your name? It's April, A-P-R-I-L. Like the month I was born in. Oh. Hey, let me guess, Taurus. Yeah. I'm a Scorpio. There any good places to pitch a tent down the river? Not any good ones that I know of. You guys can stay here, there's lots of space. Yeah? You ladies wouldn't mind? No. What's going on, guys? These lovely ladies are letting us share this lovely spot for the night. That's awful nice, but we got a checkpoint we should get going to. Actually, Liv, not till tomorrow morning. Plus the sun is setting over the mountains, so we can just set up camp here. Ladies, this is Eric Patrick and Olivia Greene-Wood. I think it's so cool that you play the drums. And you're really good, too. Thank you. So what are you guys doing all the way out here? Just taking in the great outdoors. We just finished a really long tour. Heard you guys had some beautiful scenery out here and wanted to check it out for ourselves. Sorry. Mitch, you wanna help me? Last night I got to sit down with Sled Dog. They had some interesting... Hey Mitch, you're gonna miss the interview! Speed through. I wanna hear the interview. You're not missing much. I still wanna hear it. That's right? Come over here, don't you get... - Don't get my... - Here it is, Liv, turn it up, turn it up. I'm grabbing a beer, who wants a beer? - Listen, listen. - Yeah, I'll take one, buddy. Also with me is frontman, singer/bass player Mittchell Ashley-Hoffman. Call me Mitch, Carl. And guitar player Eric Patrick. How you guys doing tonight? How are you doing, man? - Cheers. - You know, I think I speak for all of us when I say we're happy to be here in Vancouver. It's a beautiful city. Hear how you guys just wrapped on your latest tour. 11 countries, 50 legs, you must be exhausted. Yeah, I think that's an understatement. Eric, I actually didn't know this until today, but you don't just play the guitar, you also write the music. Some of it, some of it. I have the liner notes here in front of me, and I think each song says "Music and lyrics by Eric Patrick" on it. Some of the songs on there were more of a group effort. What I want to know is who wrote "Backfire"? Mitch, Mitch wrote the lyrics and the main riff. There's a big difference between "Backfire" and your new album, "Snowstorm". "Snowstorm" is more eclectic, you could say. What is that song - with the sitar? - Can I bum a smoke? "Ethos". Eric wrote the main riff of "Ethos" on our first tour on a train through India. The famous "Backfire" tour. Some might even say the legendary tour. Rolling Stone's best tour of the year, Carl. "Backfire" was platinum - within six months, incredible. - It's you. I think the question on everyone's mind is when can we get our hands on Sled Dog's next album? We've got tons of great shit in the pipeline, Carl, don't you worry. Hey, they didn't bleep - me out, nice. - If you're just tuning in, I'm chatting with rock group Sled Dog. They'll be with me till seven, talking rock and taking calls. We've got Lee from Bernadine on the line. Go ahead, Lee. Yeah, hello? Hi, Lee, you're on the air. Carl, can you hear me? Hi, Lee, we can hear you just fine. Do us a favor and turn off your radio. Oh, sure thing, sorry, Carl. What did you wanna ask the band? First I wanna say you guys friggin' rock. Me and my buddy Chad saw you - at Red Rock last year. - Didn't even try to edit this thing? So yeah, when you wrote "Backfire", did you know it was gonna rock? Eric, why don't you take that one? I honestly can't remember. Yeah, I think all of us knew that we had something big. I just don't think any of us knew how big. - Nice save, Liv. - Thanks for calling in, Lee. We have time for a couple more questions before we have to break. We've got Andrew from Surrey on the line. Hi, Andrew. - Guys, shut up. - Andrew. You there, buddy? What, I'd like to ask the band, what's it like being a shitty one hit wonder? Andrew, did we lose you? Hm, sorry about that, Andrew. There seems to be an issue with your reception. You'll have to try calling back later. Sled Dog will be taking questions until seven, but right now we have a track from their newest album "Snowstorm". Well, that may have been the best one yet. You okay? Yeah. Look, knowing Trevick, he was listening too. I'm sure he's gonna have that interview pulled - from their site by tomorrow. - Liv, Liv, Liv, I don't care about any of that. Then what's wrong? Nothing. - Eric. - What? The band is gonna be fine. You've been writing tons of new material, right? You know that this is the entrance to a sacred native river? They even have a cool name for it. Don't you wanna know the name? Fine. The River Where a Woman Became a Horse. That's not a name, that's just a description. Can take that up with the local natives. How many new songs have you written? Don't you wanna know why they named it that? I've got a pretty good idea. I'll tell you anyway. The Chehalis shamans would send their children to raft down the river when they turned 14. They would have then drink this special mixture, and then they would stop at all the same checkpoints that we're going to. This isn't your way of telling me we came all the way out here to become a horse, is it? No, no, no, no. I have no idea why they called it that. It was supposed to be a right of passage or something. The path to enlightenment, but that's just what Emerson told me. Right, legendary guitar player and native history expert Emerson Gilmore. He did the same trip about... Same trip 33 years ago, I know. I was there when he told us. I was also there when he said he didn't like our music. He didn't say he didn't like our music. He just said it was uninspired. Look, Eric, I'm happy you got to meet your idol. I'm just sorry he was such an asshole. He was giving his honest opinion, Olivia. Something that I think is fucking necessary. His honest opinion? And his honest opinion might actually still be relevant - if it were still 1975, Eric. - No, no, no, shut up, you don't know what you're talking about. We're talking about the man who single-handedly changed music history in the 1970s - and inspired me. - Okay, I know, I know. Look, we're here now. If you think this is what you need to get your ideas out, then here we are. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Thank you for coming. I mean it. I like to think it's part of my job to make sure you don't kill yourself out in the middle of nowhere. I'll be gone for a week at the most. No, no, five days, even less. Wait, I thought you were kidding. No. He invited me to come along. I'm going, I wanna go. April. This is a once-in-a-lifetime chance. I'm not missing out. Besides, it would be rude to decline the invitation. Your mom's gonna kill you. Just do me a favor, okay? Tell her not to worry. Your mom's gonna kill me. My cousin's in a band. They're called Tone Shark. Cool. He plays guitar too. You know him? No, I don't. Are they pretty popular? Yeah. I don't know, they've got some songs that play on the radio here. But I think they have this thing here where they have to play a certain amount of local music. Yeah, that's a good thing. Yep. Please don't kill my friend. I'll do my best. She's an idiot, but she means well. Just be nice to her. Don't break her heart. That's something to take up with Mitch. Then take it up with Mitch. Where is Mitch? You sure you wanna come along? Yeah. No, look, I'm sure, it's not a big deal. And you're okay with the drugs and everything, right? Yeah, no, totally. Have you ever taken acid before? Yes, Mitch, I have. You're not just saying that, right? - No. - You know what to do if you have a bad trip? Yeah, I know, I can handle my own. Hey, Mitch. We're going out there for five days, right? Come on, it's time to go. Yeah, I know that. You told me when you invited me to come along. Come on, let's go! - Bye! - Don't die! I won't! I remember the first time I heard your solo in "Backfire". It blew me away, I had never heard anything like it before. - Yeah? - Yeah. You're thinking of Eric's solo, babe. He's the guitar. Three years as a ringtone? My bad, I thought that you... Don't worry about it. Hey Eric, this stuff you got, it's clean, right? The stuff, yeah, no, it's clean. Where'd you get it? A guy, Liv, what difference does it make? So what is the difference between a bass guitar and a regular guitar, then? Two strings and a whole lot of funk. Pass me my cigarettes. Yeah, yeah. All right. Mitch! Where'd he go? He's right there. Okay, so this is the first of four campsites. Each one is labeled on the map here. And on the fifth day, we will be seeing a cabin up ahead. That's where the RV is parked. My uncle owns a cabin. Whoever was here before us did a really shit job of cleaning up. So the deal here, four each. One each night at the same time. Pass that down. No sooner, no later. Don't get them wet, keep them in a safe place, and enjoy. Why so specific? We can keep ours together in here. That's a great idea, babe. To new beginnings. Anybody know any good jokes? ♪ Transgender Jesus ♪ ♪ Oh, how you please us ♪ ♪ With the best of both worlds ♪ ♪ For thoughts and girls ♪ ♪ Gender confusion ♪ ♪ Is an illusion ♪ ♪ Transgender Jesus ♪ ♪ Oh, holy fusion ♪ What do you think, Eric? Do you see "Transgender Jesus" in the band's future? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, it's funny. You recording it? Yeah, I hope you don't mind, I used your recorder, and I made sure that I didn't record over anything. Just don't fill it up with "Transgender Jesus". It's the only one we brought, okay? I'm sorry the acid was a bust. It's fine. Bet I could find us some magic mushrooms out here, tomorrow morning if you want. It's fine, man. Really. We're still gonna have a blast out here this week, okay? Don't worry. I know. All right. I'm gonna hit the hay. You staying up for a bit? I'll head in soon. All right. - Thanks. - Yeah. - Night, buddy. - Goodnight. Spooky shit, man. Hello? Mitch? Mitch! Fuck. Hello? Morning. What are you, what are you doing? What did you do? Wiping the dead bugs off your face. Eric! Your shit works, your shit works! You must've got some slow-working stuff, but it works. That's all that matters, right? Cool. Oh, it looks like you fell asleep hashing out some tunes. Huh? Do you see that? The water, man, it's fucking beautiful. It's really fucking beautiful. Where's Liv? She's still out. I'll get her up. Your map says it's a ways to the next checkpoint. April made coffee, it's by the fire. That sounds cool. Is that a new song you've been working on? New song? Yeah, one of the songs you've been working on. Ah, it's just something I'm making up right now. Sounds cool, I like it. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, on the guitar, Eric Patrick! And on the microphone, the incredible Mittchell Hoffman. ♪ Anchovy paste, anchovy paste ♪ ♪ Spread it on thick for optimal taste ♪ Deep, real deep, Mitch. I don't write them, I just sing them. ♪ Look at the trees, look at the leaves ♪ ♪ Like pirates on the seas ♪ Watch out. We really shouldn't be stopping between campsites, guys. Only other option is I try to pee off the edge of the canoe, and I don't see that working out for everybody, so I'll be quick, promise. - Hey. - Fuck. So what's it like being in a band? Well, it's pretty cool, I guess. That's my bag. Just love how independent you guys are. So cool. You done already? Well, I said I'd be quick. I wanted to be a vet when I was little, but that was before we had to put Peanut Butter down. And then my friends say I should model, but I mean, I don't really know. I wanna work with the poor, but I'm just not sure I can handle the smell, you know? You'd make a great model. Thanks. Hey, what's that? Oh, it's, looks like a trail marker. Aboriginals used it to mark the trails with masks on the passages that were labeled safe. Saw it on an IFC special. Cool. Eric. Eric. What? Hey, what is this? What is what? This recording. This song is good. - What song? - It's really good. What song are you, what are you talking about? This one. Oh. Give me a sec. I don't, I don't hear anything. Oh, here you go. I don't know, Liv. I don't, I don't remember playing this. It says it was recorded at midnight last night. What? It says it was recorded at midnight last night. Midnight? I honestly have no idea, I don't remember this. Well it doesn't sound like Mitch. And unless April is hiding some incredible guitar skills, that leaves you. What is that? What's what? There, in the woods. Hey, check this out. What is this place? I have no idea. It's not on your little map? No. No. It says that the last checkpoint is back there. I have no idea what this place is. Wonder what it says. Probably something along the lines of fuck off. Pretty fucked, huh? This place gives me the creeps. Whoa. Looks like it's seen better days. Mitch. Don't touch it, don't touch it. - What is it? - Don't mess with some sacred native site. Ah, who the hell knows? Let's go set up camp. It's getting dark out. You really don't remember playing anything? Well maybe you don't remember playing it, but you did. Hey, where'd Mitch go? Don't know. There you are. - Hey. - What are you doing here? I'm just admiring nature. Have you dropped yet? Yeah, yeah, just a minute ago. Still having fun? Yeah, you? I'm having fun too. What the fuck are you doing? What? Do you wanna fucking overdose? Just thought it would be fun. We're out here trying to accomplish something. You're gonna fuck it up for everyone. - I... - What were you thinking? I'm sorry, I didn't... Drink some water before you overdose. Okay, I'm sorry. Mitch, April! Time to go, guys! I give you the light? Yeah. Easy. Hey guys? Coming in. Hi. Hey, where's Mitch? I don't know. What's wrong? Just a bad headache. Do you have any aspirin or anything? Eric. - What? - You got any aspirin? It's all packed up. Unpack it. What? You okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Okay. Just drink lots of water, all right? Hey Mitch. What are you doing? Look over there. At what? You see that? What you looking at? Do you see that guy? Guy? What guy, man? Right over there, sitting. I don't see anything, man. It's probably just the acid. Yeah. Yeah, you're probably right. Yeah. Listen, your girl there. Her head is... Hey look, he's standing. - Jesus Christ, Mitch. - He just fucking - stood up, Eric. - Mitch! Come on. Let's get going, we gotta go. Her head is fucking, I don't know. She's complaining. What are you doing, you okay? Mm-hm, mm-hm. - You okay, you sure? - Yeah, yeah, don't worry. Are you okay, babe? The aspirin's gonna start working soon, all right? Okay. Just tough it out. - Hey, man! - Yep? How'd you come up with this riff? I honestly don't remember, man. She okay? Just hung over. Nothing some fresh air can't cure. Ow, it hurts so bad. Jesus Christ, are you sure she's okay? Look, she's fine, really, all right? You know how it can be after drinking in the sun all day. Yeah, okay. You need to suck it up. No, make it stop. Okay, pull the boat over. Where does it hurt? - Get out, make it stop! - Suck it up, okay? Pull the boat over, she needs to lay down. She's fine, Liv, really... Okay, let me feel your head. No. I can't help you if you don't let me feel your head. Jesus. What is that, Mitch? Guys, what the fuck is going on? Okay, honey, just deep breath. Okay, just try to relax, keep breathing. Keep breathing. - Okay, pull up. - What's happening? - Please help me! - Just relax, just relax! Mitch, pull the fucking boat over! It's just a bad... Help, help me! Jesus! What do we do? How far is the highway from here? Another two days, three days best. Okay, what if we hike through the woods? How far is the road? Woods, woods, woods would be longer than two days. Not to mention I have no idea even where to go. The river's the best bet, the river will meet. We know the river eventually meets with the highway. All right. The river it is. Hey. Hey. Can I borrow your lighter? Thanks. Don't mention it. You okay? Liv went to sleep, she wanted to get an early start going to the lake house tomorrow. Something came out of her head. What? Her head, man, April's head. When it went, something came out of it. What are you talking about? I don't know, man, this thing. Something crawled out of her head. That's impossible. Do you hear them too? I don't, hear who? We should get some sleep, - we've got a long day ahead. - No, no, no, what do you hear? The footsteps, the forest. There's something out there, man. I don't hear anything. Can you see them too? They're watching us since last night. We're on drugs, man. Whatever you think you're seeing, it's just in your head, Mitch. Yeah. It's gonna be morning soon. Let's get some sleep. Hello? Hello? Jesus Christ. The sun's out, come on. We gotta get going if we wanna hit the cabin tonight. Did you sleep at all? - Quit dragging your feet. - Come on. Hear that? - What? - I think I hear rapids up ahead. Let's pull over. Careful, Liv. The fuck is wrong? Don't look at them. I know you can see them too. What are they? I don't know. I don't know, either. I just know that we shouldn't look at them. I don't think they like it when we look at them. You guys can't be serious. What, you don't see them? It's the acid, you're both high. You see nothing? - No. - Bullshit. I never dropped and I don't see anything. You never dropped? I know the difference, Liv, between real and a trip. Apparently you don't, Mitch, because if you think somebody's stalking us, you've lost your mind. Can you not consider for a second that maybe our minds have expanded to see things we couldn't see before? Enough of this bullshit, it's time to fucking go. Put your fucking hand down now. Whatever, let's just go. Come on, do you hear that? Let's go, go on. We'll be at next camp in probably three, four hours, I don't know. We should just power through to the cabin. Well, that means we'll be rowing through the dark... No, Liv's right. We should be fine, we'll just keep our ear... Ow, fuck, fuck, fuck. Fuck. Mitch? - I'm fine. - Are you okay? - Here, here, here. - Yeah, I'm fine. I'm gonna ride with Mitch. Just pull that straw, I'm gonna go grab the other canoe. I'm fine. At least take some aspirin. I don't need an aspirin. I don't need an aspirin. Stupid idea. Hey. What is that? Fuck. Must be the fourth checkpoint? No, no, no, it says we're at least, at least an hour away. - Hello? - Fuck. Hello? Guys, there's no one here. Let's move on. Let's stop, they might have a radio or something. Come on. Oh, what is that smell? Hello? Anybody there? Oh god. Oh god. Oh god. Oh my god. What happened to them? It looks like they were mauled by bears. Bears? Guys? Let's go. Fuck. Liv, let's go. We should rest for five minutes. - We can't just keep going. - Five minutes, not here, not here. Fuck. Hey guys, there's the fourth checkpoint. Right at the left. Let's stop. Cold hotdogs and soggy buns, - that's all we got. - It's fine, Liv. Let's hurry up, okay? Should change out of your wet clothes. Yeah, I'm okay, I'm okay, let's go. Behind me, there's one watching us. Can you see it? Ignore them. There's one across the water too. Just, just ignore them. They know that we can see them. They're catching on, man. Jesus Christ, it's just in your heads. It'll go away soon, it's been over a day since you last dropped. What is this, instructions? Yeah. What is that? Nothing, can we stop fucking around and get going? Give me that letter, Eric. No, Olivia, can we get going? What are you hiding from us? Eric. Listen, the stuff we took wasn't acid. Fuck, something else. He said it was... He, he, who is he? He, Liv, the guy who sold me the stuff. It's not acid? - What the fuck is it, Eric? - It wasn't acid, I don't know. He said it was the same stuff that natives used to get on their spiritual journeys. I really hope you're just fucking with us, Eric. You gotta be fucking kidding me. We came out here for this shit? You know I wanted to come out here alone. - Don't you fucking... - You didn't stop me - from coming with you. - Oh my god, Liv. No, don't you, fucking bullshit! Are you kidding? No, no, no, no, you knew I wanted to come out here alone. And what do you do, you insisted that you fucking join me. And what do you do, you bring Mitch. Yeah, I wanted to make sure you didn't kill yourself out here. That's funny, that's not what Trevick told me last week. What are you talking about? I know you were in the studio listening to my fucking demos last week. Liv, I know the only reason that you're out here is to stop me from leaving this band. It's all you have. I bet you didn't fucking tell Mitch that either, huh? The fuck are you guys talking about? Eric's making a solo album. So fucking what, Liv? - Is it relevant right now? - So what? - Fuck. - So what? So fucking what, is his head gonna pop like April's did? I don't know. I'm fine. I'm fine. Let's go. Let's go. Oh shit. Let's just go around. It's not a good idea to leave the water. Yeah, I don't really see another option. Okay, let's just get out, come on. Maybe we can just go through. - Fuck. - Let's go around. Fuck. Right. - Liv, Liv! - Liv, Liv, Liv! Mitch, Mitch, no, Mitch! - Mitch, Mitch! - Get the fuck off! - No, Mitch! - Fuck! - Are you fucking kidding me? - Mitch, she's gone! What do you wanna do, - leave her out here? - She's gone, she's gone! - She's gone, we gotta go. - Liv! Mitch, you know what's out there, come on! Fuck, no, I don't know - what the fuck is out there! - Mitch, we gotta go! - We gotta go! - I'm starting to feel like you might. I don't know what's out there, man. You're a fucking piece of shit, Eric! - No, Mitch, come on! - You know that? You're a real fucking piece of shit! Two people are dead because of you! Don't put that shit on me, man. - Don't fucking put that... - Get over yourself! Fuck you, man, fuck you. Are you seriously this obsessed with being famous? Yeah! Yeah, I am, I wanna be a part of something bigger than this shit! I wanna fucking make a mark! You wanna make some fucking mark - on music history, huh? - Yes! Be like your fucking man crush, Emerson Gilmore? No one under 20 knows who the fuck he is! And in 50 years, Blackwater's gonna be - a fucking joke, Eric. - You're so wrong, Mitch! - I'm not! - Not the time! And you know it! Oh no, it's getting worse. - Yeah, it's getting worse. - Come on, come on. Come on, come on, come on. Come on, come on. My fucking love. I gotta pierce. Why are we... Ah, I see it. I see the cabin, I see it. Mitch, Mitch, I see it. Oh fuck. Fuck, fuck. You all right, buddy? We're almost there, we're almost there. Come on, buddy. Hang in there, buddy. Fuck. Here, here, here. Sit, rest. Hello? Mitch, come on in, come on in! Hello, hello? Fuck, fuck, okay, okay. No, no, no, no, no, fuck! No dial tone, fuck! Fuck. Okay. Gotta be fucking kidding me! What the fuck are you doing? I'm gonna kill it! - Kill what? - The thing in my head, I can fucking feel it. Mitch, you're gonna kill yourself. Give me the fucking drill, give me the drill! What the fuck is wrong with you? What are you doing? Lay down, lay down. Yeah. Fuck, fuck. Fuck, fuck, here, put this in your mouth. Lie down, okay. Okay, you ready, you ready? Do it! Close your eyes, close them. Fuck, fuck. Okay, okay, okay. What are you doing? - Stop. - I can feel it! Stop, I'm here to help! - What are you... - Fuck. Jesus. What are you doing? Jesus fucking Christ. What the fuck is that? I don't know, I don't know. Put pressure on your head. There's a truck out there, we need to find the keys, come on. Where the fuck? Fuck! Open up. No, yeah, no, fuck. There's nothing in the truck, did you find anything? No. No. Is your head okay? Fucking fantastic. Okay. Why don't we just make a run for the highway, huh? It's 10 miles through the fucking forest. I have no idea, Mitch, come on. Let's find these keys, those fucking things are out there. I'll look around. Mitch? Oh fuck me. Shit, shit, shit, shit. Fuck. I didn't play this, did I? This is supposed to make me famous, huh? It's not even good. It's shit. It's a piece of shit. Oh, you're fucking ugly. Fuck you, yeah? Fuck this. Come on, come on, where the fuck are the drugs, Eric? Come on! Hey! Yo, hey. Open up. Drive. - Are you okay? - Please, man, just fucking drive. What happened? Are you okay? Need to go to a hospital? No. Take me to the police, please. Please, just take me to the police. Are you okay, are you hurt? Do you have a phone? Yeah, I do, but no service out here. Back in service soon, maybe 20 minutes. Nearest town's about an hour. Thank you. Your head, what happened? What are you listening to? What? That song on the radio, what is that? I don't know, just radio, I guess. Change it, turn it off, if you want. No, no, no. Wow, I just can't get over that song. You're tuned into XMFM 92.9. The song you just heard was "Hold the Hammer" by Over Oleander. This song just dropped a few days ago, and man, the story behind the song is just crazy. Jeremy Trout, Over Oleander's guitar player and songwriter, joined me in studio this afternoon. In case you missed it, here's a piece from our conversation. XMFM, 92.9. Jeremy, thanks for joining me tonight. Hi Carl, thanks for having me. A month back you joined me in studio before your show at the Orpheum. - That's right. - For most people, not much changes in a month. But you, for Over Oleander, everything's changed. Just a month ago you were playing the Orpheum, now rumors are buzzing that you're planning a world tour. Let's not get ahead of ourselves. Tell me about what's happened, what's changed? Well, where do I start? Highs and lows, you know, Carl? The highest highs and the lowest lows. The past two weeks have been tough, but... Did you hear about that? They found the plane way up north a couple days ago. Think the pilot got turned around or some crazy shit. You stayed behind. It's been all over the news. I was visiting family. - You sure you're okay? - Tragic, absolutely tragic. Yeah. Like the world was crashing down around me. I questioned everything, faced my demons. Same day your album dropped. Yeah, it's just too bad the others couldn't be here to take it all in. An incredible story, absolutely incredible. The question on everybody's mind is, what is the future of Over Oleander? Can you live up to the overnight success of "Hold the Hammer"? I haven't really thought about it. For now, just gonna take some time off. Go home and spend some time - with my kids. - What the hell? Shit. Jesus fucking Christ. I've got a bar, I'll call the police. Holy fucking hell. I'm just gonna step out, you okay? Yeah. We're gonna need to wait around for the cops, give statements, whatever. Maybe they can have a look at your head. Are you sure you're, hello? Yeah, I need to report a car accident. Shit. Halfway between Williams Lake and Fulbourn. No, I don't think so. It's pretty ugly. Looks like it's happened within the last hour. Hey man, what are you doing? What the hell are you doing? These are my friends. We were supposed to go canoeing. Oh, shit. Oh, I'm sorry. Fuck! I didn't mean, I mean, shit. Here, you okay, man? You oughta sit down. Police are on their way, okay? Fuck. Shit is crazy. I'm so sorry, man. Along with a sneak peek at Over Oleander's upcoming album. It's really kinda strange. Over Oleander's charter plane was found up in the Yukon. Asking, not sure how the pilot ended up so off course, but hey, now we know it's probably due to engine failure. There's more music coming up, so be sure to stick around. Oh yeah. Now, next pullback, the tune here is, it's the song that never gets old.
