Good morning. - Your coffee. - Mm. Thank you. Mm-hmm. Oh, wow. Are we having a client meeting? No. That new breakfast place opened up on Beverly. I figured it was our civic duty to try everything. Yes, we should definitely do our part. So, I was just going through the voicemails... Let me guess. How many people are looking for a wedding planner? About half. Maybe I need a new slogan... "Carly Mason, Bridal Stylist... I just do the clothes part." Or... you put yourself out there more. Become the face of your own brand. Then there's no question what you do. Jen, we've been through this a hundred times. People hire me because I don't seek out the spotlight and make it about me. See, I'm like... a Bridal Ninja. But you could be a Bridal Samurai. Well, I generally try to avoid swords. And hey. We're booked up for the next year, so I must be doing something right. Ooh, Sydney. Say hi to Sydney. Hey, Sydney. Hi. So I'm hearing rumors that Kira McCabe is getting married in Mexico next weekend. Would you happen to know anything about that? I'm really not at liberty to say. But you know I'm her biggest fan. So is Liam going to be the photographer at the wedding? I think so. Yeah. It's fine. We're professionals. You know what you need? A spa weekend at the lodge with your best friend. I am talking unlimited, deeply-discounted pampering, courtesy of the general manager. I would love that, but I have a wedding party to dress every weekend for at least the next year. Come on, Carly. Just take the break. You know you deserve it. Oh, hey, Syd, I have to go. I have another call coming in, and I really need to get that. Is it Kira McCabe? Tell her I said hi. Bye! Bye! Hi, Kira! Hey, Carly, so something's changed. Okay. So Kira just got the biggest leading role of her career, but they start shooting in Bulgaria on Saturday. She's moving up the entire wedding by three days. So we only have two days to prep? Mm-hmm. I'll be flying down tomorrow with all the wedding clothes. Oh, it's so beautiful. All right. Everything's in place. It's almost time. Let's get your bridal party dressed first, and then we can focus on the star of the show. Can I talk to you for a second? Yeah. Sure, Kira. Is everything okay? Are you feeling nervous? Oh, no! I'm fantastic. The dress is perfect. I couldn't be happier. I sense a "but"... Remember how my mom insisted on getting her own dress? Mm-hmm? Well, she got it. And she hates it. I just want her to be happy and enjoy herself. She means everything to me. I wouldn't have any of this without her. You're a wonderful daughter, Kira. And I had a feeling your mom wasn't feeling confident about her dress, so I brought along a little something... Oh! It's absolutely perfect. I love it! Look how happy she looks. - I can't thank you enough. - It's my pleasure. Everyone in the bridal party should feel beautiful. We scoured every store in Los Angeles. Where did you find it? Oh, I designed it. Yeah, and I had my tailor in the city make it. I didn't realize you did couture. Well, I don't. It was just a special project for one of my favorite clients. Well, you should. Thank you. That's very kind of you, but what I do for now is all I need. You made today perfect. The wedding party looks incredible, Carly. And so do you. Thanks. Well, looks like we have the entire weekend free, and it's paid for. You want to stay and hang out? You can't be serious. You broke up with me, remember? Well, if you aren't staying here, what are you going to do? I'm taking a break. - Hi. - Hey. Reservation for Carly Mason. Oh, we've been expecting you. Sydney's so glad you decided to come. I am, too. What is this? Filipino Fusion. Peking Duck-filled Empanadas, with a fresh papaya-chili dipping sauce. No. It's just an appetizer item for the bar menu. I've been perfecting the recipe for months. Here, try it. Special-menu items are the purview of the Chef de Cuisine. Oh, look. That's me. Edward. You act like I'm a... line cook. I'm a chef, just like you. A chef, yes. The chef in charge? No. I just think if we edge-up the menu a little, bring in some more fusion cuisine, we can bring in more clientele to the lodge as a destination for foodies. I think my Michelin Star is quite enough to get "foodies" in the door. With all due respect, that was 25 years ago. A lot's changed since... Why are we even talking about this? If I'm not mistaken, you have a wedding to cater, which, if I'm not mistaken, is your actual job here. You said "If I'm not mistaken" twice. That's because I'm very much not. Mistaken. Hey... I just made these killer Fusion Empanadas Peking Duck. I'm dyin' to find out what people think. Maybe just offer them up as a free sample? Did Chef Edward give you the okay? Why wouldn't he? That's not an answer. Okay. - You're welcome. - Thank you. I'm so excited! We should totally get facials. Right? Here you go. Cucumber-basil martini, and... we are offering complimentary samples of Chef Nick's Peking Duck Empanadas with a papaya-chili dipping sauce, if you're interested. Yeah, that sounds amazing. Thank you. There you go. Enjoy. Thanks. Is everything okay? I'm so sorry. It... I think something's kind of off with these. Oh, I'm terribly sorry. Hi... Hi. Can I help you? I'm the chef. Nick Rivera. And, uh... I made the bad empanada. I didn't say it was bad. Well, you sent it back. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to insult you. It just... it wasn't for me. All right. The thing is, um... The thing is... This dish is supposed to be my signature appetizer, and so if there's something specifically wrong with it, I really need to know... what it is. Specifically. Okay, well, if you must know, it sort of just had an odd bitter taste to it. No, there's nothing bitter in any of the ingredients. I don't know what to tell you. It was bitter. Mm... hmm... I'm so sorry. Um, I'll be right back. You don't have to. You don't... Okay. Jackie? From Tiburon College? It's Carly. Mason. We were on the same dorm-room floor. Of course! How are you? - I'm... - I'm great. Wow. It's so funny running into somebody from school. I haven't even been back here since we graduated. Well, seems like everyone from our dorm floor is here for the wedding. Oh? Wedding? Jason and Andrea. That's why you're here, right? Oh, that's where I recognize them from! It's Andrea and Lily. So you're not here for the wedding? No... Oh, well, you gotta come by and say hi. Oh, no, no. I don't want to intrude. And I'm waiting for my friend, Sydney. Do you remember her? She was my roommate. Yeah, she runs this place now. Oh, wow, good for her. This place is... spectacular. Isn't it? Well, you go. Have a great weekend. Thanks. You too. Bye. Okay... I know what happened. One of our kitchen staff used the wrong knife for onions. The same knife that was used for horseradish. That's why it was so bitter. Well, there you go. That makes perfect sense. I'm glad you solved the mystery. So... here you go. It's okay. I really... I wasn't even hungry. I won't be able to rest unless I know that you know what it's supposed to taste like. Look, I know I may seem a little obsessive... Mm. It's just... this dish is... it's a part of my culture. My history. And... when I serve my version of these traditional Filipino recipes, it's kind of like I'm putting myself out there. Yeah, okay. Well, I appreciate how hard that can be. Yeah... so just one bite. Okay. That is good. Mm. Phew. Thank you. Mm. Okay. Why don't you leave me to it, and I'll report back if anything changes. Okay. Good. - Hello. - Hi. Oh, you're a guest at the wedding? No, actually, but I know them. We were in the same dorm at Tiburon College, and most of them actually grew up around here. But you didn't get an invite? Ouch. I wasn't really a part of their group. Mostly because I was always working to pay my way through school. Didn't really give me much time for a social life. Yeah... I believe that. That's an expensive school. I had a partial scholarship. And my parents did the best they could. But, you know, honestly, I think my mom talked me into going to that school just so she could tell her friends that her daughter went to the "fancy school" in the hills. The classic "live vicariously through your kid" technique. Your parents weren't like that? You know "helicopter parents"? Yeah, mine were like... an entire fleet. My parents are very disappointed that my white coat says "Chef" instead of "Doctor". Oh... yeah, that's tough. Yeah. Wow. How did we go from empanadas to group therapy? I don't know. Carly Mason? Matt. Matt! Hi. Are you here for the wedding? No. No. I'm just... here. I would love to catch up. Yeah, yeah. Sure. Yeah. Ex-boyfriend? No. Just a friend from college. But you wanted to date him. Okay, yeah, fine. We were supposed to go out right before graduation. But we never got a chance to. Why not? Just bad timing. I had a last-minute internship. He had a job interview in New York. It just didn't happen. Can I give you some free advice? I'm good. Just don't act so nervous. Yeah. Play it cool. What part of "I'm good" were you unclear on? Best of luck. Okay. Carly! I can't believe you're actually here! I can't believe you didn't tell me about the little "college reunion" that's happening this weekend. Oh... Am I the only person here not going to this wedding? Aside from the staff? Pretty much, yeah. Seriously? Yeah. Crazy coincidence, right? I had no idea it was that Andrea and Jason until everyone started showing up this morning. No. Way. Is that Matt Harper? Yeah, I guess so. This just got good! Wait! Where are you going? - Go talk to him! - I don't think so. Are you kidding me? How many times have you wondered about him? Or asked yourself, like, "What if?" What if you went on that date? What if this is your second chance? What if this is fate? Okay, Syd, I came to see you, not go back in time. Anyway, I highly doubt he's single. Oh, please hold. He is so single. He's with his friends! We were friends with them, too. Friend-ly. There's a difference. Yeah. Sometimes, I feel like we worked so hard in college, that maybe we kind of missed out on all the fun. Well, I don't regret how hard we worked at all. And it was worth it. Look at us now! Good point. We are pretty fabulous. Yes, we are. But I just feel like you're really gonna regret not seeing if there's still a spark with Matt Harper. I don't want to have to be on for an entire weekend on just a "what if." You don't have to be on. Just be yourself. Okay. No one is their real selves at the beginning of a relationship. Do you really think that? I know it! But it doesn't matter, because all I want to do for the next four days... is relax. It's going to be okay. It's not going to be okay! I thought letting you pick your own pink dresses would be cool, and that way, you guys could actually really wear them again. Why didn't I realize they'd be opposite shades of pink! Yeah, but it was really nice of you to let us pick our own. We're really sorry, Andy. We should have coordinated. Yeah, we should have. It's not your fault. It's mine. I just wanted to be different. Now it doesn't even look like you guys are part of the same wedding party. I should help her. You don't have to. You're on vacation. No, it's okay. I know what to do. I'll see you later, okay? Hi. I'm so sorry to intrude, but I overheard your problem, and I think I can help you. - Really? - Really. It's what I do for a living. I don't know if you remember me... Carly! Of course I remember you. Jackie said you were here this weekend. You didn't say that she was a wedding planner! I didn't know she was. - Actually, I'm... - I'm not. I'm a bridal stylist. I just do the clothes. Help me. I got you. She dresses so many celebs. Don't worry. Okay. So I called my vendor in San Francisco, and he had exactly what I was looking for. I found a pale-pink pastel satin ribbon with a little bit of greenery to tie in the shades of both the dresses. Now, both these dresses would look wonderful with the ribbon tied around their waists. And we could wrap your ribbon around your bouquet stem, and the guys could have matching pocket squares. Henry at Barris Fabrics is expecting your call. He could have all of this done by tomorrow. If that works for you. Are you kidding? - It's perfect! - Great. Do you know what this kind of reminds me of? How Kira McCabe's wedding party looked two days ago! I just saw the photos online. Yeah. Actually, that's what made me think about it. Oh, you saw the photos, too? Well, I actually did the styling. What? And then I came here for a little R&R when we were done. Oh, my gosh. I can't believe you actually helped me when you're supposed to be on vacation. Thank you so much. It's my pleasure. I hope you have a wonderful wedding on Sunday. Will you still be here? Yeah... Oh, then you have to come! I insist. So? I'm dying. What happened? Well... I solved her bridesmaid dress problem, and she invited me to the wedding. See? Now you're not the only person here not going! Problem solved! Technically, I didn't give her an answer. Hey, Syd. Here's the finalized "happy hour" menu. Thanks. It's great. Oh... Nick, this is my best friend from college and beyond, Carly Mason. Carly, this is Chef Nick. He does all our event catering. - We met. - We met. Uh, yeah. There was an incident with the horseradish. Hi. That's Matt, yeah. Carly has a thing for him. Oh, I know. How do you know? Oh, my gosh, you guys. Because I have eyes. Oh, Nick, Carly got invited to the wedding. Should she tell you what she wants for dinner? I still haven't decided. She's going. Well, when you do decide, your choice is the thrilling wedding trifecta of chicken, beef, or vegetarian. Looks like chicken. Syd! Ooh, wow. We didn't order these. Chef Nick told me that you were his official taste-testers this weekend. Thank you. Wow. He's so talented. How come he only does the wedding food? He's waiting for Chef Edward to retire so he can take over. He did Kyle's birthday one year. It was incredible. Syd, go home. Okay, get some rest. But you just got here. I want to take advantage of every second. But you're about two seconds away from faceplanting into our plate of food. Okay. - Goodnight. - See you tomorrow. - Okay. - Love you. Love you. Mm. - Hey. - Hey. Do you make the desserts, too? Yeah, it's all hands on deck right now. These wedding parties are really fun, but they can get pretty busy. I know. Oh, thank you for the appetizers, by the way. So good. Especially those crispy shrimp wontons. Oh, hey, that means a lot coming from you. What do you mean? I looked you up online. You're famous! No, I just work for famous people. I'm normal. And so are they, for the most part. Oh, come on. What, you don't get starstruck? No. People are just people. No one really flusters me. Hey, Carly. - Hey. - Hi. - Whoa! - So sorry! Yeah, I can tell. He's coming this way. Hang on to your hats and glasses. Go, go, go, go, go. How are they? Pretty good. So, Andrea said you're coming to the wedding? Mm. Just nod yes or no. Yes. Good. I'm really glad you're here. Me too. So... How'd that go? We're engaged. You got a cookie crumb. Oh, great. Perfect. Hey, you should know better than to take a bite of food while flirting. Were you watching the whole time? Oh, yeah. It was like watching a little sitcom. And I'm the lead? No, you are the wacky neighbor. Thanks a lot. It's a compliment. Most leads are usually pretty boring. Are you going to the barbeque tomorrow? Say yes. Yes. Great. We'll catch up then. Okay. What? That was a wave. Yeah, like you were lost at sea and he was the captain of a rescue boat. I'm... I'm getting some tea. All right. You do that. You know, 90% of what you say doesn't come out of your mouth. Body language is the key. So... just play it cool. Okay, look, I am. That's not cool. You know, I like how you've just decided that it's okay to follow me around all weekend and give me advice without being asked. I'm sorry, I just know how guys think. They can see someone trying too hard from a mile away. I'm not doing that. Okay. Don't you have somewhere you need to be? Yeah. Prepping wedding potatoes. Again. Oh... sounds like you want to be doing more than that. Is it time for therapy again? I'm just asking as a friend. Okay, so this is officially a friendship now? We've already talked about our parents, and you've been giving me non-stop unsolicited advice about my love life, so... I guess you're right. Friendship it is. Well, on that note, friend, I should... I should probably head back to the wonderful world of au gratin. I'm sorry. Don't be. It's a good, steady job, and... I'm grateful to have it. Sydney mentioned that you wanted to take over for Edward someday. Yeah, that's the plan, but the man refuses to retire. Okay, well, why wait? Why not just open your own restaurant? It's impossible to get an investor unless you're a "name," which I'm not. Look, all you need is word-of-mouth. I actually have a ton of clients in the city. Maybe I can help you make some connections. Really? You'd do that? See? Friendship perks already, huh! Look, you're obviously very talented. You just... you need to put yourself out there. Okay. Well, um... I don't know what to say. Thanks. I haven't done anything yet. Still. For you to even think of helping me... That's pretty cool. And you know what? I can help you with Matt in return. Like I said, I don't need help. I am fine. One for the road. Stop it. Stop it. Don't. Stop it. Maybe I do need help. Hey, Jen. Hey, can you send someone to my apartment to overnight the blue dress I just got? And my silver Manolos? I need something to wear on Sunday night. You can't find something there? You want me to go clothes shopping on my vacation from my "clothes shopping" job? Okay. Good point. What's the event? I got a last-minute invite to a wedding. Friends from college. Well, not friends-friends. Just people we knew. Well, not "knew-knew". I helped the bride with something, and she invited me to the wedding. Just can't get away from work, huh? It's... a little more than that. You've already met someone? Actually, it's someone I already knew. - Hi. - There you are. So, should I just meet you down by the bar? No. You don't have to wait for me. Just head down to the fireplace and I'll meet you there after. I still feel like maybe I shouldn't join in on some of the wedding stuff. I mean, we're not really part of their group. It is just a barbecue. Where your soulmate also happens to be. Okay, Syd, I've barely spoken to Matt. I know. I just... I have a really good feeling about this weekend. That's all I'm saying. Now go. I'll see you later. Okay. - Hey. - Hi. Ooh, looks good. "I call it "bore-be-cue". Yeah, I'm guessing the lodge's wedding coordinator doesn't exactly invite you to meet-and-greet prospective clients. No, she does not. Hey, the bartender's off just getting some ice, but I can get you a drink if you'd like. Yeah. Soda water and a couple of cherries. Yeah. You got it. Bubbles. And a couple cherries. A couple more. Mm-mm! One more. Okay... Yes. Ooh! - Cheers. - Thank you. What? I love garnishes. I am exactly the same way. I put a ridiculous amount of olives in my martinis. Mm. Don't even get me started on skewered fruit. Actually, anything on a skewer, I'm going to eat it. What are you doing? Nick, these are not "eat the garnish" people. Yeah, but you are. Why are you hiding it? Okay... you know what, I never really vetted you in the dating department. I mean, if you're such an expert, tell me about the amazing relationship that you must be in. I'm single. - Really? - Yeah. Okay, don't look at me like that. All right? Most of the events that I do are at night. I barely get Saturdays off. I work every weekend. Mm. Actually, I know exactly what you mean. This is my first weekend off in over a year. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, the truth is, the last few women that I've dated have been pretty clear that they were tired of waiting. For you to get off work? And for me to be more than a banquet chef. That's awful. But, hey, if you ask me, I think the fact that you ran into the one that got away on your one weekend off... that's a great sign, huh? He didn't get away. I never had him in the first place. Come here. Well, now's your chance. Don't blow it. Thanks. Carly, hi! Andrea, great job planning the weekend. Everyone looks like they're having a blast. Thank you. Just like the good old days. I have to take your word for it. I feel like back then I never really got the chance to just hang out. Well, we're glad you are now. I'm glad, too. Here you go, my soon to be wife. Aw, thank you, honey. I wish the photographer was here to take a group photo of the Tiburon College ladies. Oh, well, here, I can do it. Carly, you're one of the ladies. Matt can do it. - Sure. - Thanks. Ladies only. Hey, hit me. Squeeze in. Do we all look okay? Do we need a little "zhuzh"? Is that the right word? Yeah. No "zhuzhing" necessary. You look great. Okay, ladies. Let's see those gorgeous smiles. Perfect. You, uh, got a text. Technically, that's a no. Uh... that's another Matt. Oh, there's two Matt Harpers here? I really hope so. Matt, buddy, game time. Yeah. I'll see ya. I love horseback riding. When? Lily, you are going to love this. Look what I found on my old hard drive. Photos from our ski trip over winter break. Oh, my gosh. You don't want to see the photos? I wasn't there. I was always so impressed by you, you know. You always worked so hard. You knew exactly what you wanted. Now look at you. You're at the top of your game. How do you know that? Word gets around. It was really nice of you to help Andrea. Oh, it was not a big deal. I was just happy I could help. And such a weird coincidence that I happened to be here at the right time. To me, there's no such thing as coincidence. I think people are brought together for a reason, even if they don't know it yet. I'm glad I decided to come. You weren't going to? To be honest? The older I get, the more I see the "Singles Table" as a particularly cruel form of torture. I could not agree more. So... why don't we sit together? Finally go on that date. I didn't think that you remembered that. Of course I did. I mean... who knows what might have been? Well, only one way to find out. Is that Sydney again? Yeah. Let's take a selfie. Oh, I'm not one of those "pictures or it didn't happen" people. I'm not either, but this is clearly an emergency. Okay. Okay, yeah. That oughta do it. Thanks. Guys, watch this. Watch the master work. I'm going for it. Okay, I know, that's my cue. I'm sorry. We will rebuild! Top you up? Thanks. So that looks promising. Yeah. Yeah. He's still a very sweet guy. Hasn't changed a bit. Should we book the wedding band? It was one conversation. Well, sometimes, that's all it takes. Yes, thank you. So, hey, I was texting with my client, Georgina, about you. And turns out she's hosting a function at her house in the city next week, and the private chef just canceled. So, are you interested? She runs with a bunch of Silicon Valley types with money to burn. Next week? That wasn't exactly the reaction I was hoping for. Don't you want this chance? Oh, yeah. Of course. It's a great opportunity. So, what's cooking? For the masses? Baby back ribs. But for you? Barbeque pork skewers... with a side of achara. Achara? Pickled papaya, carrots and peppers. But I put my own little spin on it. Oh, my gosh. It smells amazing. Why can't you serve that tonight? Everything okay out here, Nick? You bet. Too much spice. Of course. I'll dilute the dressing. Did you literally just get in trouble for flavor? We don't call him "Chef Bland" for nothing. It's all yours. Okay. I'm so excited. That's it. Mm. Mm! Mm! Nick, that sauce is amazing. It's my secret recipe. Yeah, I've been playing around with it for years. Any chance your secret includes sesame? You could taste that? Wow, your palate must be really refined. No, it's not my palate. It's my face. Because whenever I have sesame, I break out in a hive. How is it? No. There's nothing wrong with your... Oh, no! Is it bad? It's bad, isn't it? No, no. You can barely... I don't... I don't... Maybe you're lying to me. Are you lying to me? No! I'm so sorry, Carly. It's okay. It'll go away in a minute. Anyway, it was worth the mild allergic reaction. "Worth the mild allergic reaction." I think that's probably the best compliment that I have ever gotten. You're not really going to eat like that, are you? Are you kidding? It's the only way to eat them! I totally agree. Cha-ching! Aren't you the one who convinced us to try it this way when we all went camping? Did I? I don't remember. You're both insane. Check out this beauty. Aren't you going to finish that? Uh, yeah. I'm just full from dinner. Well, I'm going to go for it. Trust me. In my line of work, we learn to live in the moment. What do you do for work? I'm a trauma nurse in the E.R. Wow, really? Yeah. I didn't know that's what you ended up doing. That's incredible. I remember when you made everyone cookies when they got sick. I never got any cookies. Yes, you did. Everyone got them. Well, I am exhausted. I have to pace myself. Goodnight! Goodnight. Yeah... Same here. - 'Night, Lily. - 'Night. 'Night, Matt. I think I might take a little walk around the grounds. Want to join me? Play it cool. Yeah, I actually think I'm gonna call it a night. Okay. No worries. It was nice catching up a little. - Yeah. - I'll see you tomorrow? You betcha. "You betcha!" I don't know where that came from. I've never said that in my life. See? That is why pastry chefs hate me. Because whenever I make dinner, people don't have room for dessert. Oh, no, no, no. Actually, that's not it. - I just... - I have a weird quirk with dessert. Do tell. You'll think I'm insane. Probably. So... I only really like to have dessert when I'm home, so I can really take the time to savor it. I try to make it last as long as possible... And I even use a tiny fork if I can find one. Okay, yeah, you're insane. Hey, I can make a piece of cake last an hour. Have your dates seen you do this? No, because your reaction is exactly why they have not. Thanks for the "play it cool" advice, by the way. You're welcome. Hey. You got my back, I got yours. See you tomorrow? Yeah. You betcha? Funny. Mm-hmm. I forgot how nice it is to do nothing on a Saturday but take a stroll. I wish I could stay, but duty calls. - No! - I know. Okay, so there's a great little craft store around the corner, and then the farmer's market. Thank you. I'll check it out. And don't forget you have a massage at 7:00 with Hans. Okay, there's no way his real name is Hans. Okay, his name's Gary, but tell no one. - Okay. - Bye Hey. Oh! Hi, Carly. Hi. You doing okay? I was trying to find a new dress for tonight, but... nothing seems to be working. Hmm... well, do you mind if I take a look around and pull some looks for you? You really don't have to. I want to. - I would love that. - Okay. I'll be right back. I don't know... this isn't a color that I would ever wear. Just trust me. Come on. See? Oh... I would have never picked this color. I love it! You're amazing. Let's save "amazing" for E.R. nurses. I help people feel better about how they look. But you... you're a nurse. I mean, you help people feel better, period. What I do pales in comparison. Aw! Thank you. So, why weren't we better friends in college? I know. Syd and I, we weren't really around the dorms that often. But it's been really nice getting to know everyone better now. Second chances don't come around that often, do they? No. They don't. You look amazing! See? Thank you. - Hi. - Carly! - Hey. - Hi! What're you doing here? We just played a quick round of golf. Our driver dropped us off. Said there was an award-winning food truck here today. Would you like to join us? Yeah. Sure, sure. - Hey. - Hey. Matt, this is Nick. He's the chef taking care of everything for the wedding this weekend. - Oh, hey. - How's it going, man? Just played an early nine holes. Life is good. We're heading to the food truck. Do you want to join us? Uh... yeah, sure. Why not? Okay. I meant to ask. Do you golf? Does miniature count? Not really. They both use those tiny, little pencils, right? That is true. I could teach you how to play if you want. That would be great! Ooh, it's a hot wings truck? Look! You can win a hat. Oh. Yeah. I'm gonna pass. Oh, yeah. Me too. You guys don't like hot wings? Normal ones, sure, but... these are supposed to be torture, and I'm pretty sure a chef burning his own taste buds out is a bad career move. If I wanted to suffer for a free hat, I would just play in a pro-am. But hey. Feel free. I don't know. I mean, if you guys aren't having any... Hey, Carly, if you want to do it, do it. Okay, yeah. You know what? I'm doing the challenge. - You in? - No. I'm not messing with that the day before my wedding. I guess you guys are just scared. I'm in. All right, three for the Firestarter Challenge, please. Okay. Are you guys ready? Yup. Bring it. - Okay. - Yeah. Nope. Nope! No! I'm sorry. Are you okay? Oh, no. I'm out. I'm dying. Yeah. Thanks. Yeah. Milk! Thank you. You okay? All right, well, I guess... Is it my turn now? No, Carly. No, no, no, no. Seriously. You're going to end up in the hospital. Thank you both for your concern. Mm. We have a winner! Wow. Thank you. Mm. So good. You hustled us. That's impressive. My dad used to make these every weekend for Niner games. I built up a pretty high tolerance. Thank you! Guess I should have maybe mentioned that, huh? Hey, Nick. Hey. - Thank you. - Yeah. - You walking back? - Yeah. I'll join you. What do you mean? I guess I just don't get fashion. Well, fashion is a way for someone to express who they are, how they feel, how they want to be perceived by others. It makes all the difference. Isn't that kind of superficial? A little bit? Okay... do you think that people would take you seriously as a chef if you came to work in ripped jeans and a tank top? If the food was good, yeah. I just think that people should be who they really are. Fashion is an extension of who I am. Okay... well, then why don't you design your own clothes? What? It would be great. What? What's wrong? There was a great little cafe here just two weeks ago, and now it's closed. So... it's available. No. No. I'm not going down that road again. You tried opening up your own restaurant before? Yeah. Why didn't you tell me? It's not worth discussing. It was a long time ago. It just didn't work out. The investors and I didn't see eye to eye on a lot of things. So that's why you weren't sure about cooking for Georgina? Yeah. Owning your own restaurant is a huge risk, and I just can't take any risks right now. People depend on me. Oh. Do you have kids? I just realized I never asked you. No. No kids. My lola's in a very expensive retirement home. Your lola? Grandmother. Yeah, I help pay for any expenses that aren't covered by insurance, which is a lot, so I just can't risk losing a steady income because I think I'm too good for wedding chicken. Yeah, well, you are, though. You just need to make it clear to whoever invests that you want full control over the menu right from the start. I just don't want to get my hopes up. About anything. You have a gift, Nick. You need to share it. I could say the same about you. Oh, I thought fashion didn't matter. I'm sorry what I said about your job. You're amazing, no matter what you're wearing. I just hope Matt realizes that, too. I should really hustle back for happy hour. I'm making a charcuterie board. That's like all the garnishes. I'll save you a couple skewers. Yeah? Hey, perks of knowing the chef, right? This one. May I have everyone's attention, please? We just wanted to thank you for coming to our special pre-wedding happy hour. I hope you're all enjoying the wine and this incredible spread. But take it easy tonight. We expect full participation on the dance floor at the reception tomorrow. Now, has everyone entered their name into the raffle for Chef Nick's special private dinner tonight? How did you talk Chef Edward into letting you do this? Uh... I did not. It's his night off. Tonight, the kitchen's all mine. Wow. I'm jealous of whoever wins. And the winner for a gourmet dinner for two is... Matt Harper! I guess our official first date just got an upgrade. If you want to join me, I mean. Yes. I would love to. Sounds great. I should... I should head back so that I have time to make a romantic dinner date for two. - Hi. - Hi. Thank you. You look beautiful. Thank you. Good evening. First, Chef Nicolas has prepared tortang talong cakes... Eggplant crabcakes topped with bagoong tomatoes. Thank you. Wow. So, it turns out you are one of those "pictures or it didn't happen" people! No. Just this once. I'm showing a client of mine in San Francisco what Chef Nick can do. Mm! Mm. This is wonderful. Not an eggplant guy? Not so much. The cucumbers in it... It's great. - Cheers. - Cheers. Next, we have Chef Nick's kinilaw bites... Tuna ceviche stuffed in taro chips, with a seaweed salad, and a fresh hint of cilantro. So good, right? Yeah. Yeah, it's great. For the final appetizer course, Tinola dumplings, chicken and ginger filled, with a pickled trio side. Enjoy. Nice. - Are you okay? - Yeah. I'm fine. I guess I'm not the most adventurous eater. Well, this is the best way to try new things. Small bites. Lots of courses. Yeah, I suppose so. To be honest, the meal's not that important to me. I'm just glad we finally get this time to get to know each other better. Me too. So... how did you get into fashion design in the first place? Well, for a long time, I wanted to start my own clothing label, so I majored in fashion design... but right before graduation, I dressed my cousin's bridal party, and that's when I realized I loved helping people find their signature style, so that's what I do now. I'd ask you to style me, but I spend so much time on the golf course, my wardrobe is pretty much polo shirts and khakis. So many khakis. As long as they're not pleated, you're fine. Oh, no. I'm so sorry. This is my rep in Scotland. Oh! Will you excuse me? Of course. It's fine. Go ahead. Sorry. Hi. Ready for the main course? Matt's just on the phone. It's hot food. You're allowed to start. It's official dining etiquette. Okay, well, in that case. What did you make? It's my Lola Anna's famous glazed chicken adobo, and because there's so much Chinese influence in Filipino cuisine... Kiampong. My version of fried rice that's all wrapped delicately in a banana leaf. Oh, that smells just like the fried rice my mom made growing up. See? You grew up with Filipino fusion and you didn't even know it. I don't know how you do it. It's like... It's like a culinary map across Southeast Asia. Like, you could really taste how one culture influences the next. That's exactly what I was going for. Main course. That looks great, Chef. Bon appetit. Enjoy. This is so good. Mm! Delicious. So where were we? Uh, sorry? That's right. Khakis. Right. Hmm. Yeah, I think we pretty much covered that particular topic. Yeah. No pleats. No pleats. I'm so sorry. We're going to have to close the kitchen early tonight. Is everything okay? There's a water leak. You guys should probably go. I understand. Let me just get the tip for Patricia... Andrea and Jason... They took care of it. Oh. Excuse me. Okay. Sorry. Hey... Hey, what's really going on here? Chef Edward, he just showed up. Thanks again for the amazing meal and the amazing service. Hey, you know what, I'm just going to go to the ladies room. Okay. Okay! Went rogue on the menu again, huh? Maybe just a little. Okay, well, just so you know, that was the best meal of my life. Hey! How was dinner? It was incredible. It was... good. Just a few things I wasn't into. Like... cilantro. Oh, no! Oh, yes. Wait, you don't like cilantro? It tastes like soap. I heard it does for some people. You should have said something. It's fine. I bet you told the chef it was delicious. How do you know that? Because you never want to hurt anyone's feelings. It's one of your best qualities. So, what are you guys up to? Andrea and Jason are having dinner with their families, so we're going to head to town and have one last drink. Do you two want to join? I'm in. Carly? You know what? You guys go ahead. I'm about two seconds away from a food coma. You sure? I don't want to just ditch you. You're not, I promise. Go, go, have fun. Have fun. All right. You still want to go? - I'm in. - Okay. - See you. - Bye. - Hey. - Hey. Is everything okay? That was close, but Chef Edward did not catch on. - Thanks for your help. - Yeah. Hey. You know where you don't have to cook in stealth mode? Your own restaurant. I know... So... where's Matt? We called it a night. I... I made you a little something... extra. What is it? Bibingka. It's my lola's old recipe. Coconut-rice cake. No fusion. Just old-school good. Thank you. I can't wait to try it. You're welcome. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. Okay, then. Nick, hey! The Bibingka cake and the tiny fork... that was so sweet of you. I mean, no one has ever done anything like that for me before. Well, now someone has. Okay. My ride's going to be here in five minutes. Wait, where are you going? Aren't you prepping for the wedding? I already did everything so that I could have time to cook lunch for Georgina and a few of her clients. - Today? - Today. I'll be back in plenty of time. She's sending a car. - Oh! - Yeah. That's fantastic! I'm so happy for you! Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Nick, you're going to blow them away. I just, I know it in my gut, this is going to change your life. I hope you're right. I know I'm right. So, when does the car get here? Uh... three minutes. - You found a dress? - Yes! A dress the equivalent to a piece of tofu. Well, do what I would do. Spice it up. It would take more than a little spice. Believe me, if I had time, I would just remake the whole thing. Don't you have all day? I suppose... I mean, you did major in design, right? Time to use it. How did you know that? I heard you tell Matt at dinner. The question is, why wouldn't you admit that it was something that you wanted to do? I guess I just didn't want to admit it to myself. Hey, if I'm going for it, you should, too. I got to go. Wish me luck. You don't need it. You are going to be amazing. And thanks, Carly. None of this would've happened without you.

This dress... it's incredible, Carly. People would buy it. And the one you designed for Kira's mom. I mean, you know what people want. All you have to do is take a chance on yourself. I'm still not sure I want to be in the spotlight. Mm-hmm. That's because you always see yourself as, like, a... a back-up singer. You make everything and everyone around you better, and you never take any credit. Okay, but you are not a back-up singer. You are... you're a singer/songwriter. You are a musical genius. This... this is your song. I know you don't like people always telling you to be better... be more... Like your mom always did. But if this is what you want... you owe it to yourself... to give it a shot. You're pretty awesome, you know that? We both are. I'm just glad Matt finally got a chance to see it. Well, actually... Matt and I aren't going to happen. Oh... sorry. Well, I guess that answers the "what if" question... Unless... What if... this weekend was never really about Matt at all? What are you talking about? It took coming here for me to realize that you can't fall in love with someone until you love yourself. All of yourself. Not just the version that you think people want to see. Nick showed me that. Wait. Chef Nick? You were right about this weekend being about fate, Syd, but Matt is not the reason I came. Whoa. Nick is. Whoa. I know. I'm still wrapping my head around it. How did I not notice? Because I wasn't being weird around him. I was just being myself. No second-guessing. No playing it safe. Just... me. So what now? Now we find out if he feels the same way. Okay, is it Nick? Is it Matt? It's Andrea. The bridesmaids need some help putting things together. Okay, but what about Nick? Well, lucky for me, tonight, I know exactly where to find him. Perfect. ♪ It's somethin' that I can't describe ♪ ♪ It's sent from up above... ♪ Thank you. You're welcome. ♪ ...I'd like to take you somewhere new ♪ ♪ So we can start again... ♪ Oh, Patricia! Have you seen Nick yet? Did he tell you how lunch went? He only just got back. He barely made it in time. How did he seem? Oh... He was floating on air. I knew it! Hey. Sorry. - Hey. - Carly. Let's go. Hey, I'll find you after dinner, okay? Okay. I got so much to tell you. I do, too. Yeah. Okay. Here. And for you. Hello? Yeah. Uh-huh. Yeah. Hey. I thought your designer dress didn't make it. It didn't. I designed my own. Wow. It's a beautiful dress, Carly. Thank you, Lily. Excuse me. Oh, yes, oh, yes. Lily, are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. I... I just needed a moment. I just... I wanted to say I'm sorry. I should've noticed sooner that you still had feelings for Matt. Matt Harper? No. I... I don't. I broke up with him years ago. Before our senior year of college. I know. But that doesn't mean that feelings just go away. He's moved on, Carly. With you. And I totally get it. I'm happy for him. Honestly. You're amazing. Here's the thing. I don't want to date Matt Harper. And Matt Harper doesn't want to date me. He still loves you. How do you know that? Because I see the way you look at each other. The way he looks at you. I just didn't notice at first because... Didn't you have a thing for him in college? How did you know? Everyone did. I mean... he's pretty much perfect. But that's just it. The Matt Harper I built up in my head... He was perfect. But he's not perfect for me. He's perfect for you. I know he is. You need to talk to him. But what if you're wrong? What if I'm right? Big rock here. He's a lucky man. Look at the size of this rock. Yeah, let's do another one. Yeah, you take the necklace this time. Come with me. Smile! Yeah. Okay... We need to talk about Lily. What about her? You still have feelings for her. Carly, she broke up with me years ago. She moved on. Yeah, and you tried to move on back then, too. You even asked out someone new. I know our date took a few years to actually happen, but... you know, now I think... it wasn't meant to. I'm so sorry, Carly. You're wonderful. And I did wonder what might've happened if we went out all those years ago. But I'm not Lily. And I'm not Chef Nick. Thank you, Carly. Nick, wait. Nick, stop. I'm sorry. I have to go. I don't understand. A half hour ago, you were fine. You were better than fine. What happened? After the dinner service, Georgina called me to tell me that she wasn't impressed by my culinary offerings and that she was going to pass on investing. Chef Edward, who was already annoyed that I was late coming back, overheard the phone call, and he didn't like the fact that I was looking for another job while I was supposed to be making Chicken Marsala. Between that and a busboy accidentally telling him that I went off the menu again, Chef Edward finally had enough to fire me, and I can't say that I blame him. Oh, no. I'm so sorry, Nick. So, now I have no job, no investor. Nothing. I don't know what I'm going to tell my grandma. That I blew it again? That I can't help her? Nick, I'm so sorry. This is my fault. I pushed you into this. No. Hey. Carly, it was... This wasn't your fault. I made the decision to go there. I just let things go too far. Let let me talk to Edward. Or Syd. We can fix this. - We can... - Carly... I've loved getting to know you, but I... just let myself dream too big, and it was a mistake. Are we just talking about cooking here? Maybe we should've just kept our dreams to ourselves. Nick, come on. I'm sorry. I've got to go. Any luck getting Chef Edward to rehire Nick? I'm still working on it. This is all my fault. No, it's not. You were just trying to help. I can't believe it's ending like this, Syd. I know. Yeah, okay. Great. Okay, bye. Thanks, Jenn. What? Nothing. I'm just glad Sydney talked you into finally designing your own line. It wasn't just Sydney... Hey, Syd. Hey. Look at you doing your thing. I'm so proud. Thanks. I have to admit, I've never been happier. Creatively. I was talking to our retail manager about maybe having some pop-up shops in our lobby. Do you think we could display a few pieces from CJ Mason? Oh, yeah. I would love that. Great! And, you know, I mean, when you're in town, maybe you can find Nick and talk. Nice try. I'm happy to come up there, but as far as Nick goes... I have to move on. Got it. Love you. See you soon. This dress is gorgeous, Carly. I bet every piece you brought is going to sell out in five minutes. Well, that one's not for sale because I made it for you. Really? Of course. It's the least I could do. I wouldn't even be doing this without your encouragement. And Nick's. Oh, I'm sorry. Thank you so much for this dress. I'm gonna wear it to dinner tonight. You have any place in mind? Yeah, there's a new place on Main that's getting some great reviews. Let's do it. - I'm so glad we're doing this. - I know. I can't remember the last time we went out. Oh, cute. So cute. Oh, hi. Sure. Thank you. So, an old friend reached out and suggested this place. I'll be back, okay? Hi. Hey. I... I don't know what to say. The last time I saw you, this seemed... Impossible. - Yeah. - I know. How did you go from that to this? I mean, I thought Georgina didn't like the menu. Oh, she definitely wasn't a big fan, but turns out everybody else really loved my food, and eventually, they tracked me down. And they became your investors! But none of this would've happened if you didn't believe in me first. Nick, I'm so happy for you. I mean, now you're free to just put it all out there. No holding back. Yeah. And I heard that you're doing much of the same. Yeah. I was finally ready. Thanks to you. All I did was remind you of who you already were. Look, Nick, that night at the lodge, I didn't get to say what I wanted to say. - I... - Is this her? Oh, hi. Yeah, Lola, this is... this is her. Carly, this is my lola, Anna. And, Lola, this... this is Carly. Hi. It's so nice to meet you. And I'm a huge fan of your Bibingka cake. Oh, thank you. You walked away from this? Yeah... Biggest mistake of my life. Lola... maybe you can go back and sit at our table? Oh, fine. You were... You were going to tell me something before we got so... adorably interrupted? Yeah. Okay, I have an idea. Follow me. Okay. Better? It won't be better until I can tell you how I feel. I didn't think that I'd get another chance. Neither did I. And, um... I'm not holding anything back anymore. ♪ It's been a while since those days ♪ ♪ I still get that feeling when you walk my way ♪ And I'm really hoping you feel the same way. Does that answer your question? Maybe tell me one more time. ♪ ...But you kept walking anyway ♪ ♪ You smiled ♪ ♪ And that said everything to me ♪ ♪ Love came easy ♪
