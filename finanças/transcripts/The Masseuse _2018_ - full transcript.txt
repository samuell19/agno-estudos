Is this place called 'Pink Dolphin'? I'm the new freelance technician. My name is Loong. - Ohh, you are here to fix the machine. - ﻿Yes Well, go upstairs and walk all the way straight, the room is on your left. Thank you. Please strip and lie down. Uhh, no. My name is Loong. I'm a technician. Ohh... you're the new technician? Yes. Relax. You're more nervous than I am. Sorry Did it hurt? You have a good sense of humor. How is it possible for me to experience "pain"? Wow... you haven't been serviced for ages. Such is the fate of old models. If my reactions weren't as delayed, my lady boss wouldn't have summoned you. Your model is really dated. Precisely. It is only a matter of time before I am decommissioned. The new models are vastly superior, capable of dancing and singing. Do you think droids are immune to "feeling troubled"? Alright, stand up and move around, there ought to be no more problems. Why don't you lie down. Otherwise, I won't be able to test my functions. ...Droid Policy Committee stressed that... ...﻿the government would not impose strick controls... ...over the droids.

You didn't forget what you're supposed to do, did you? Get up! You again? Well... ...I'm worried if you encountered any problems, so I came to have a check. What happened? It's nothing. Have a seat. You men are all the same, always acting tough. There are things... ...you will never understand. I know. I'm an emotionless and heartless droid. How could I ever solve your problems, right? My dad... ...﻿used to be very famous. He was at the top of his game. But now he is disabled, so he strongly desires for me to become him. Truth be told, no one should become anyone. Otherwise, what's the difference... ...between you and us? If only things were this simple. To be honest, do you actually have any friends? I am referring to real friends. Are you real then?

We're free to do anything we want. No one can stop us. Alright. Stand up and move around. You should be fine now. Then... dreaming... ...must really feel good.

At times when you are alone, will you think of me? Today, is the last time I'm coming here. After this, you will be just fine. Ohh, I have installed an new update for you. Try it out. Don't let your lady boss know! I... can I hang around for awhile? I never ask you to leave anyway. If you don't ask, how would you know... ...I won't say yes? Let's leave together... ...and never come back, shall we? Why are you so quiet today? Eh? Not really? Am I? Where do you want to... ...take me to? Anywhere will do.
