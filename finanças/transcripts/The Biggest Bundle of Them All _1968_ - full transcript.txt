MY FRIEND THE PROFESSOR SAMUELS IS THE GREATEST PROFESSOR IN THE WORLD. PROFESSOR, TELL THEM A LITTLE SOMETHING ABOUT YOURSELF. GO ON. WELL... I DON'T LIKE TO BOAST, SEE?

PRETTY BOY FLOYD? OH, I COULD NAME A DOZEN OTHERS, ALL MY CLIENTS. YOU NAME THEM, I PLANNED THEM. MORE THAN $22 MILLION. THAT'S WHEN A DOLLAR WAS A DOLLAR. THEY EVEN MADE MOVIES ABOUT THEM. AND THE MOST IMPORTANT THING, HE NEVER GOT CAUGHT. THE PROFESSOR AND I, WE SAT TOGETHER MANY TIMES, DREAMING OF JOBS. SOME WE ALREADY DID. SOME WE WAS GOING TO DO. NOW, IN MY NEED-- WHEN DON CESARE NEEDS TO GET BACK RESPECT-- I CALL HIM IN PHILADELPHIA, AND HE IS HERE, THIS TIME, WITH THE PLAN FOR THE BIGGEST BUNDLE OF THEM ALL. BRAVO! BRAVO! SSS! BRAVO.

WELL, NOW, GENTLEMEN, WHAT ARE WE ALL AFTER? MONEY. WELL, THERE ARE MANY WAYS TO MAKE MONEY. WORKING... BORROWING... OR, UH... THINKING. OF COURSE, SOME OF US BELIEVE IN STEALING, BUT IF WE STEAL WITHOUT THINKING, ALL WE END UP WITH... IS TIME. BUT, UH...THINKING-- RIGHT THINKING--AND STEALING WILL BRING US... RICHES. NOW, THIS, GENTLEMEN, REPRESENTS... RICHES. ROUGHLY $95 AN OUNCE. I HOLD HERE IN MY HAND 380 DOLLARS' WORTH. NOW PLEASE EXAMINE IT. THE CHEMICAL SYMBOL IS Pt, FOR PLATINUM. NOW, THIS PRECIOUS METAL COMES IN INGOTS THIS SIZE-- 4 INCHES BY 1/3 INCH BY 7 1/2 INCHES. IT WEIGHS 100 OUNCES TROY. OF COURSE, THIS INGOT IS MADE OF LEAD. I'M MERELY USING IT AS AN ILLUSTRATION OF SIZE. IF IT WERE REALLY PLATINUM, IT WOULD BE WORTH... $9,500. BUT HOW DO WE GET IT? IT IS SHIPPED FROM COLOMBIA, SOUTH AMERICA, TO GIBRALTAR, AND FROM THERE TO TARANTO, WHERE IT IS PUT ON A SPECIAL RAILWAY CAR AND MOVED BY TRAIN TO A SECRET LOCATION. WHERE'S THE LOCATION? DOESN'T MATTER. IT WILL NEVER GET THERE. WE'LL STOP THE TRAIN AND REMOVE THE PLATINUM. HA HA HA! STOP THE TRAIN, HUH? MM-HMM. DO WE RIDE ALONGSIDE ON A HORSE, JUMP THE ENGINEER, AND SHOVE A GUN AT HIM? DON'T INTERRUPT! SHUT IT UP. IT CAN BE DONE. WHAT'S MORE, IT WILL BE DONE. WE'LL NEED SPECIAL EQUIPMENT, YES, BUT TIMING, PLANNING, AND ABOVE ALL, DARING... AND IT'S OURS. NOW, MAY I CONTINUE? SURE. GO AHEAD! THERE ARE MATERIALS TO BE PURCHASED. THEY'LL HAVE TO BE ASSEMBLED. ALL THIS WILL REQUIRE SOME MONEY. THAT BLOWS IT. HOW MUCH MONEY, SAM? $3,000, OR ABOUT 2 MILLION LIRE. DONE. WHERE DO WE FENCE IT? MOROCCO. MOROCCO? WHO IN MOROCCO? I'LL TAKE CARE OF THAT, AND I'LL INFORM DON CESARE. HOW DO WE KNOW YOUR MAN WON'T DOUBLE-CROSS US? YOU'LL BE THERE TO WATCH HIM. HOW DO WE GET THERE? YOU'LL FIND OUT IN GOOD TIME. THE PROFESSOR IS 100%. HE TAKES CARE OF EVERYTHING. THAT'S WHY WE PAY HIM THE KIND OF MONEY HE ASKS. [BENJY] PROFESSOR, HOW MANY INGOTS OF PLATINUM DO WE NEED TO GET 5 MILLION? 482. 482 BARS, 100 OUNCES A BAR, THAT'S, UH... NEARLY 3,000 POUNDS. THAT'S ABOUT 2 TONS. WHO'S GOING TO BE ABLE TO LIFT UP 2 TONS OF THAT STUFF? THE DEAL IS OFF. THESE BUMS COULDN'T LIFT 2 POUNDS OF HORSEFEATHERS. THEY'LL DO IT. I'LL MAKE THEM DO IT. YOU HEAR ME? I'LL MAKE YOU DO IT!

WHERE ARE YOU GOING? TO SEE MY WIFE. YOU KNOW HOW MAD SHE GETS IF I DON'T SEE HER. NO MORE LOVEMAKING-- NOT UNTIL THE JOB IS FINISHED. SHE'S GOING TO BE MAD AT ME. I SAY YOU RUN! SURE. I'LL RUN... FOR 5 MILLION BUCKS. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? WE NEED 3 GRAND TO GET THAT 5 MILLION. SO FAR, I DON'T SEE ANY 3 GRAND. THE PROFESSOR'S BEEN TALKING IN MILLIONS. WHY DON'T WE GET THE MONEY FROM HIM? THE HIGH COST OF LIVING HAS LEFT ME TEMPORARILY SHORT. REALLY, I--I HAD TO BORROW MONEY TO GET HERE. I SAID I WOULD GET IT. AND I SAY I WANT TO SEE IT BEFORE I DO ANY MORE RUNNING. PUNKS! SMALL-TIMERS. CHISELERS. ALL RIGHT! I GET THE MONEY. TONIGHT! [WOMAN] IS THAT YOU, CESARINO? SI, SI, CARA. WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN THESE PAST DAYS? I COME BACK FROM AFRICA AND NOT FIND YOU. I BEEN WORRIED SICK. NOT EVEN A CALL FROM THE TELEPHONE. YOU DON'T LOVE YOUR LITTLE PUSSYCAT NO MORE? YES, YES, MIA CARA. I HAVE BEEN TIED UP. VERY IMPORTANT BUSINESS OUT OF TOWN. FORGIVE ME, DARLING. OH, I FORGIVE YOU, BUT COME CLOSER TO ME QUICKLY. [CAR TIRES SCREECH] [HORN HONKS] UN MOMENTO. CESARE, PLEASE COME BACK. WHAT ARE YOU DOING THERE? UH, NOTHING. A FLY.

I COULDN'T TAKE THEM EVEN IF YOU MADE ME A PRESENT. I PAID A LOT OF MONEY FOR THOSE. ALL I WANT IS 3 GRAND. YOU MIGHT AS WELL ASK 3 MILLION. I CAN'T HANDLE THEM. THEY'RE TOO HOT. UH, MAYBE IN A COUPLE OF YEARS, IF WE RECUT THEM. A COUPLE OF YEARS? YOUR TERESA'S GOT EVERY COP IN NAPLES LOOKING FOR THEM. I'D HELP IF I COULD. I DON'T FORGET YOU STARTED ME IN THE BUSINESS. I KNOW, FRANCO. YOU ARE A GOOD BOY. BE CAREFUL GOING HOME. CELLI'S GIRL HAS THE COPS LOOKING FOR HIM? YES. YOU ALL BETTER BE CAREFUL. SHE HAVE A REWARD OUT FOR HIM? UH, YES, I THINK SO. A SMALL ONE. YOU WOULDN'T BE THINKING ABOUT COLLECTING IT, WOULD YOU? I WOULDN'T DO THAT TO MY FRIEND. HE WAS THE HAND THAT FED ME. AND THESE ARE THE HANDS THAT WILL TEAR YOU APART IF YOU OPEN YOUR MOUTH. UNDERSTAND? YES, BUT I CAN'T BREATHE. LET HIM GO. THAT'S A GOOD BOY. I WANT TO MAKE SURE HE STAYS THAT WAY. I SAID, LET HIM GO! [COUGHS] I APOLOGIZE TO YOU, FRANCO. SOME PEOPLE HAVE NO REGARD FOR OTHER PEOPLE. THAT'S ALL RIGHT, MR. CELLI. I UNDERSTAND. YOU GOT NO BRAINS. YOU GOT NO SENSE. ALL YOU GOT IS A BIG GREED. YOU DON'T DO THAT ANYMORE! NEVER TOUCH ANY OF MY PEOPLE ANYMORE! WHAT'S THE MATTER, CELLI? YOU GETTING SOFT IN YOUR OLD AGE? YOU SAID YOU WERE TOUGH. REMEMBER THE IRON FIST? I ALSO REMEMBER THE IRON HORSE, AND BOTH WENT OUT WITH THE AIRPLANE. I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU, HARRY. I THINK MAYBE WE'RE NOT GOING TO GET ALONG. YOU THINK YOU CAN GET ALONG WITHOUT US? TRY IT. YOU'RE NOT WHAT YOU USED TO BE. THEN MAYBE... I DON'T DO THE JOB AT ALL. I WOULD RATHER DROP THE JOB THAN WORK WITH A PIG. I DON'T TRUST YOU, HARRY. YOU DON'T TRUST ME? I WAS ONLY LOOKING OUT FOR OUR INTEREST. EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT. JULIANA KNOWS THAT. DON'T YOU, BABY? OH, SURE. YES, YES. HEY, BABY, WOULD THAT LOOK PRETTY ON YOU? TRY IT ON. OH... IT DOESN'T REALLY BELONG TO ME. CELLI WILL LET YOU TRY IT. WON'T YOU? COULD I? OF COURSE. OH... HELP ME HOOK IT UP, HARRY. I'M ALL THUMBS WHEN IT COMES TO THAT. MAYBE CELLI COULD DO IT. HMM?

[PROFESSOR] EASY. VERY EASY. THEY DO A FIRST-CLASS BUSINESS, AND THEY HAVE PLENTY OF CASH. I'VE BEEN CASING IT. WHAT ABOUT THE POLICE? DON'T THEY CRAWL AROUND THERE AT NIGHT? [PROFESSOR] THEY DON'T DO THINGS LIKE THAT OVER HERE. NO PROBLEM. THEY MAKE THE BEST PASTA E FAGIOLI IN TOWN. YOU CAN FORGET ABOUT THAT. YOU'RE ON A DIET. A RESTAURANT FULL OF PEOPLE. IT WOULD BE EASIER TO KNOCK OFF SOME QUIET JOINT WITH FEWER PEOPLE AROUND TO SEE. THAT'S THE BEAUTY OF IT. WHO WOULD THINK OF KNOCKING OFF A RESTAURANT AT ITS BUSY HOUR? NOBODY. THAT MEANS NOBODY WILL BE ON GUARD. ONE MAN...INSIDE. QUICKLY HE TAKES THE MONEY... OUTSIDE BEFORE ANYBODY KNOWS. SIMPLE. [CELLI] A GENIUS OF AN IDEA. OH, WELL, UH... ALL RIGHT. I'LL DRIVE. FINE. BENAMI, YOU WILL HANDLE THE GUN. ME? I'M A BETTER WATCHER. OH, I'LL WATCH. ME, TOO. GOOD. HARRY DRIVES. DAVEY AND TOZZI WATCH, AND BENIAMINO GETS THE MONEY. LET'S GO MAKE PLANS.

THEY TELL ME THAT IN THIS GREAT CITY OF YOURS THERE IS A UNIQUE AND PROFITABLE BUSINESS-- THE BUSINESS OF REPAIRING JEWELRY. AS I UNDERSTAND, A GREAT DEAL OF IT IS SHIPPED HERE FROM ALL PARTS OF THE WORLD, AND NOT ALL OF IT ARRIVES IN GOOD CONDITION. TO SHIP IT BACK WOULD BE TOO EXPENSIVE, SO EACH SHOP SENDS ITS JEWELRY TO A CENTRAL LOCATION IN THE CITY FOR REPAIRS. COLLECTIONS ARE MADE ONCE EACH MONTH FROM ALL THE BEST SHOPS IN TOWN, AND THE STONES AND THE SETTINGS ARE BROUGHT IN PLAIN CASES BY ONLY TWO MEN-- SPECIAL GUARDS WHO WEAR PLAIN CLOTHES SO AS NOT TO AROUSE SUSPICION.
