Marton, make the horses pick up the pace! Quick! Quick! Fatia Negra! Oh my God! - Are you after cash? - No, the jewels. Ferenc! Ferenc! Gosh... From her ears too! The famed black jewelry... After me! THE POOR RlCH Based on the novel by Mor Jokai Screenplay by Composed by Cinematographer Starring Distributed by Directed by Call the doctor! Clementine, doctor! Hurry up! Quickly... Oh, dear Lord, what happened? Henriette! Jesus Christ! Is she dead? Sweet Mary. Help me. Erzsi! Grab her. Take her leg. Mademoiselle... Get out of the way, Kalman, don't just stand there, go, go, go. But why? She doesn't want to become the baron's wife. She what? It is my place to decide whom my granddaughter shall marry! I’m laying here for eight years and I still live! And as long as my eyes remain open, I command here! The doctor? Margari has already left for him. Everything will be all right, the poison failed to do its worst, all he needs now is to rest. Poor boy... I’ve really grown to him. Stay calm, counselor, a young and strong body will fend off this illness effortlessly. Tomorrow morning... - Apologies. - This way please... Your humble servant, your Excellency. Good evening, Margari, why did you come? Do not be mad at me, his Excellency sent me here for doctor Lorinc, they told me you'll be here, so here I come... Is there something wrong, perhaps with his Excellency? Aaah... It is Mademoiselle: she poisoned herself! lf anything comes up, call me promptly. I’ll return in a while, she should rest until then. That is the most important thing now. Copper solution is a most dangerous poison, I’ll examine each metal container in the house tomorrow as those must be the culprits. Oh yes, the assistant and stepson of attorney Sipos was also afflicted with copper solution poisoning. - In the past weeks? - Today! I came from them. That is most strange: both of them at the same time? Is the young man over the worst of it? He is. I do hope that both of them will be up and healthy in a week or two! Kalman! He sent this. He is fine now. Szilard... Don't you cry now, that does you bad. Kalman, quickly bring my box to me, go. What I give you now, you must forward to Szilard... Mr. Vamhidy... Promise that you'll do it. I promise. Kalman! How dare you enter here? Henriette needs her rest! Aunt Clementine, I like it when Kalman is in here. No, it's not! Granddad forbade it! Get out! Out! Aunt Clementine, can't Margari visit either? I’d like him to read for me: I’m bored! Margari? Alright, Margari can visit. Oh, dear baron... I’m sure our Henriette will be overjoyed! A tiny courtesy, no more. How does Henriette fare? In a few days you sir can see with your own eyes. Oh! Then I may be hopeful that Mademoiselle Henriette will soon agree to my proposal. Henriette is an obedient little lady who knows that our decisions are in her best interest. Dear baron, we'll be soon relatives now, the Lapussa wealth shall be unified with the Hatszegi wealth and so both of them shall be blessed with the royal insignia. Let us call each other on our first names... As Mademoiselle commanded, Margari has come. Please, dear good Margari, you're the only soul I still trust: will you do what I’ll ask of you? Margari is fond of Mademoiselle... He would run into flames for her sake! Take these documents and promise me that you won't take a peek into them, but rather hand them over to my brother Kalman. He will know what to do about them. As Mademoiselle commands. Margari is an honest man... I beg to report, sir, I happen to know why Mademoiselle fell ill... Mademoiselle Henriette trusted me with these: they contain everything. Margari, did you actually read these documents?! Yes sir, I’ve read them carefully. - Give them here promptly! - Aah, it's not in Hungarian. I’ll make sure to translate it... But it will cost. A lot of money. Take a seat, my son. I’m facing you as if your father, make sure to face me as if you were my son. You've fallen in love with the daughter of an affluent family and it was mutual: you've exchanged letters in secret, they were carried to and fro by her brother, and this entire shady smuggling went on right in front of the relatives and the governess. Who could have uncovered it? Reach right under my pillow, Henriette. You'll find a bunch of papers there, pull them out and take a look at them. Hey, hey... All right, dear granddaughter... I can see you're crying, so you still trust me. It is all up to you. A marriage with a decent man that matches you or a nunnery for you and for that pounce of a kid-brother, a strict boarding school! - Grandfather! - And a criminal prosecution! ...Against that haphazard youth, so that he'll be put away for at least five to six years! Death... is not a toy... and to solicit to suicide is truly forbidden! Get in your room and give it a long thought. I’ll call for you in exactly two hours... You will make up your mind till then. Dear son, you may be quite right, but I still am the family's attorney! We've thought of that too: there may be a time when her hand will be driven to deny me. But I still won't believe this. Until she utters or writes the single word that... That only the two of us are aware of. Szilard... I’m going... Well, my child, did you make up your mind? I did. A veil... or a headdress? I will marry the baron. Bravo! Henriette... Dear counselor... Well, my girl, it is up to you now, behold the marriage certificate. The baron has already signed it. Show us your beautiful handwriting. One more thing, Mademoiselle Henriette. Kindly write a single word down here. A word, a name that only you and another soul know, to certify that your abandonment is final. lf you may. For the sake of his serenity. Mesarthym... Well, well, well, well... Dear son, try not to be perturbed about this so much. This is the way it had to unfold. But why? Was her promise this cheap?! Do not call that girl names, this is something else. The power of nobility and wealth. Everyone has a right to be happy! We all wrestle for our rights in vain until counts and barons tyrannize over us in this country. They only admit sycophants and panderers to their midst! lf you confront the lot of them, they'll bash in your head! Certainly not mine! I’ll change careers, brother. I’ll work as a judge, not as an attorney. We need prosecutors here, not defenders. Very good. Return to Arad county. You were born there, your future lies there. Dear son, serve justice over there. How beautiful you are, Henriette... Dear little Henriette... Please don't. Not here... Forgive me, your beauty has deprived me of my wits. But I am able to wait, if need be. I’d like to hope that l may be able to conquer you you're my wife after all. We'll take a rest stop, this is my homestead already. My God, look at that! The baron... Long time no see, your excellency. Did you actually marry? Who's your wife, this one? No, she's on the old side. And this one's a child. Give us food and drink, we're here to rest! Let's get inside. Oh, here, here, please enter, baron! Please, please, enter! Here you are. Hey lads, what's this? Can't you see who's entered the room? Ripa, you! Hey, move it already! Greet the baron and his wife! Leave her alone, that's just a servant. This here's Onuc, richest man of these lands! The owner of a goldmine. And his daughter, the beautiful Anica. But Henriette, a peasant girl?! I hear that your goldmine makes good returns, Onuc. The mine is small, sir, it hardly has any gold in it. I’m a poor man compared to you, sir. Because next to your wealth you have a beautiful treasure. Sit right down, dear souls, gentle baronette... - What shall I bring? - Bring us all you got! And wine to all of us here. Fetch us some wine! Old chap, what news from the Arad dungeons? My good pal Marci Csendes was hanged today. You sir knew him, he was a famed minstrel. Did any new songs survive Marci? - He wrote one in prison. - Let's hear it. My rose, hand me, hand me your white kerchief, Let me wipe my flowing tears... A nice song. Bandi, why don't you play it for his Excellency. Give us something merry instead! Anica, show the baronette how ladies dance in these parts! When did you last see Fatia Negra? It’s rumored that you're his lover. I don't know Fatia Negra, your Excellency. Stop right there, beauty, I need you to dance with me! I won't dance with just anyone! Say what?! Am I anyone? You'll pay for this! Gyurka, stop the madness, Gyurka! Gyurka, cease and desist! No one is allowed to humiliate me! Play it! Lenard! Forgive me, Henriette, I should not have brought you here. How strong you are... and it was a wonderful dance. Well if it was wonderful, some thanks are in order. And now scram, all of you, my wife wishes to rest. The bedroom is this way, I’ve already prepared it, your Excellency. Please enter! No! No. Should we go on with our travel? Yes. - Right now, in the night? - Yes. Please, in my house you command. We shall move on. Bring forth the carriages. Let's stop, sirs, this is baron Hatszegi's carriage. It really is, they are bringing the Mademoiselle! Don't you know her? She's a sight to behold. Varlet! Hey-hey, what a pleasant chance meeting, Gerzson! Lenard! Henriette, let me introduce our dear landowner neighbor, my friend Gerzson Satrakovics, the sheriff of Arad county! Baroness, my sincere congratulations to your husband! Though if one is lucky enough to have such a wonderful wife, I’m sure he's unlucky in card games! Thus allow me to express our sincere gratitude. Is my husband really such a good player? Once I won a thousand gold from him, but just once! True, that sum was stolen from me by that... roguish Fatia Negra. - Who is Fatia Negra? - A robber chief. One that we always fail to apprehend. He wears a black mask, thus he's labeled Black Face. Are you hell-bent on scaring my wife with ghost stories? God forbid! Forgive me, baroness. Lenard, where should we begin our autumn bear hunt? This year in my forests, I have some great specimens. You sure have! You see, baroness, I still carry the scar from one! You were attacked by a bear? I attacked him, but he was the stronger one! I can thank Lenard's rifle that I can pay my respects to you right here right now. Let us carry on now, Hidvar is still a long way to go! Your new home, Mademoiselle Henriette. Hidvar. Your suite. Naturally, the castle and the staff is at your disposal: please entertain yourself, invite guests, live a pleasant life. I shall only step in here if you explicitly invite me. I told you to stop pestering me, this is not my business! The school burned down a year ago. Since then, its walls are overrun with weed. The teacher left too, leaving no one to educate the children. They will grow up to be rogues, boors and they'll further damage the nation! Then watch out for your kids, don't let them deviate! This is your responsibility! And if you panhandle here once again, I’ll have my staff apprehend you! Understood? Don't you ever set foot in here again! But why don't they renovate the school? Because the people are poor, and the rich are avaricious. It’s business as usual for centuries here and I told this point blank to the baron, that is why he forbade me to enter the castle. Have the school renovated, have the peasant kids wear boots instead of sandals, practice charity to your heart's content. I’ll even send for the priest and invite him here. So that everyone can see that in my homestead my spouse is the lord... I’ll return home in a week, Mariora. - Did you take the salt? - Uh huh. The skies protect you, little son. Don't you cry! Get going, Juon, the flock is moving on. Hey Ursu, take care of them! Anica, when did you last talk to Fatia Negra? Two months ago, when he said that he'll go on a journey far from here. He's at home nevertheless: I saw the sign 2 days ago in my window at night. That cannot be. He's back for three days and won't pay me a visit? Hey now, there are many pretty girls over mountain as well! He won't find one quite like me. And he knows full well that I’d kill him if... Kill him? Do you think Fatia Negra is scared of you? That man is a devil! Hey-ho! Mariora! A new lady's arrived in the castle, beautiful one too! - Where to, Anica? - In the mill. To grind wheat. - Is Juon gone? - Yes, I’m alone for a week. A lady or a girl hates to stick alone! Are you glad that Fatia Negra has returned? - What do you say? He was here? - Indeed! He played with bear, then he left. He said he's hurrying to meet you. He was here, he played with the bear... God be with you! I’ll come around to fetch it tomorrow. Make sure it's ready by then, hear me? I’m worried, domnule, that it'll be a very potent poison. I told you, it's not against a man. It’s against a bear. Cook corn cakes and mix it with them. Understand me? Are you assured, Fatia Negra? Hey-ho! How's the weather? - Full moon! - That's right! Pavel can come in! - How was the yield this time? - At least eleven bushels. That's really good. Didn't Fatia Negra leave ahead of us? Not today or yesterday. See, father, he's not here! But I know that he's around! Then I’ll just enter and see for myself! Come to your wits, Anica! No girl may enter here. The guards force everyone to undress upon entering, and once again upon leaving. To the hell with all this then... Fatia Negra! You may enter, Anica... Make her swear on it at least, domnule... Like everyone else who enters. No, Anica's oath is stronger than that. It is about our eternal love. We're smelting the gold here! This presses it into disks! Here they cut it out, but now it's empty yet. They mint the money here. This one's done. The finest gold ever, and still it's counterfeit. lf it's gold, how come it's counterfeit? We don't hand in the Treasury their cut, but use it to mint further coins instead. This is our interest... Alright, old chap, have it measured, then receive your earning for it. Won't you be present, milord? No, I’ll listen to your daughter's voice for now instead of the tinkling of coins. Come on, my beautiful Anica... May the mine hag take you away... Didn't you fall in love with someone? Oh, I couldn't find anyone prettier than my Anica in all the counties. My father said there are pretty girls over the mountain as well... Hey, Anica! I want to see your face! Just once, just for a moment! The time will come for that too. That's what you always say... I was paid in kind, domnule. What about you? Don't be mad at me, sir, but I need to ask: when did you become the husband of my daughter? lf you ask this once again, your head shall arrive home sooner than you! Fatia Negra swore on it, but what does he care? He swore that he needs that poison against a bear, not a human being! - Against a bear? - That's what he said. He took it today. It’s very potent. He played with the bear... I think he really needed the poison against a bear! God bless you. Mariora, open up! Anica, I’m tending for someone ill! - Is it your child? - No, it is Ursu! So it is true after all. Fatia Negra targeted her! He poisoned the bear! The blackguard... - Where is Juon now? - Up with the flock. You're in danger, Mariora! Gosh, don't you wake up! Ursu! Ursu, do not die! Who shall protect me? Mariora! Are you asleep? Let me in, open the door. I cannot, I’m alone. I cannot, I’m alone! That's exactly why. Allow me to enter, that'll make two of us. That would make three of us! You know Ursu! Heh heh, Ursu has dropped dead in the time being! You are alone! What do you want of me? I have a faithful husband! And your bride is Anica! Hey! Your husband drops dead whenever I wish so. And only my mask remains faithful to Anica: if I throw it away, she'll never find out who I was! Blackguard... You'll pay for this, Fatia Negra! - You have weapons. - You have weapons! There's a tree 50 steps from here, hang your weapons on it. lf you return unarmed, I’ll believe that you don't intend to murder me. Silly broad... Here I am unarmed now, let me enter! But admit it honestly that you enter with good intentions! Woman, open it up or else I’ll break through it! Open up! You just woke my child, can you hear him crying?! Open up the door or l'll break it and hurl your kid next to the wall! Ursu! Help us! Ursu! Ursu's just died! You! Stay put! Who are you that makes our lives so hard? Are you lured by the 200 gold they grant for my head? I’ll give you 500! I don't want your money, I want your head! You'll never come free from these hands! We'll see about that! Let us see your ugly unknown face! Let me tear the mask off, you devil... Let me go! Watch out, Juon! Juon! I’m glad for you, brother. But now you can see for yourself the hardships that come with being a law officer in these parts. Alright, Mihaly, it is lit, you may leave. What happened to that strong man Juon? Oh well, he's still lying in bed full of fractures after they dropped down below. I’ll make sure to smoke this Fatia Negra out of his lair even if I die in the process. Very good, brother: if need be, I’ll support you with the county regimens. But make sure to get warm here for you'll have a hard time out there, trouble is brewing. You know, the Vienna gentlemen know exactly how to incite strife amongst the heterogeneous populace here. Then they have an easier time sorting them out. Enter. Aah, Lenard, welcome here! Allow me, sirs: baron Hatszegi, Szilard Vamhidy, our new law officer! I’m sure we'll meet quite frequently in the future, I visit here all the time with my cases. I’m at your disposal at all times, baron. My brother Szilard tasked himself with rooting out Fatia Negra permanently. A noble cause that I shall support if you'd accept. God be with you, brother. Sir. - Such a decent fellow, eh? - It would be a pity. A pity? Fatia Negra has dealt with harder men in the past. He is here... he came after me. Enter! - The postman just brought it. - Thank you, aunt Clementine. A star? Mesarthyn... Szilard! Szilard? But Henriette, what could he send you? Just wait. Beautiful... I’ll put it on! Enter! Forgive me, dear Henriette, for barging in... What a nice jewel piece... family heirloom? Yes... I’ve come to bid farewell. I’m off to go hunting. Don't! Don't go, Lenard. It’s nice of you to fear for me. lf you insist, I won't go. And will you come to the celebration? What celebration? We'll inaugurate the new school. I’ve invited the priest, the pharmacist, the... A decent company indeed... lf it makes you happy, I’m ready to embark on the hunting trip a day later. Thank you. Anything for you, Henriette. Someone who's so beautiful, so... You're really flattering, I... I’m embarrassed. - And I’m not even... - Not my wife yet. Is that what you meant to say? Henriette, can't you see, can't you tell how much I love you, how much I desire you? Let me make you mine... - I cannot wait any longer. - No, not yet... Yes, now, I want you, you'll be mine... - You're my wife and... - Please don't, Lenard! Don't! I see... I understand, Mademoiselle Henriette. Welcome, Madame! Please, come this way. Take a seat! Headmaster, sir, the baroness is arriving. Children, stand right in line as we learned! Welcome, your Excellency! Long live! Long live her Excellency, the baroness! My dear, make sure to greet that elderly lady first, the one sitting there... with the shaking head. Once she had an ugly run-in with Fatia Negra... The baroness comes here first. I’m enchanted to meet you. Such a pleasant lady. The jewelry... the black jewel! My jewels! Fatia Negra robbed them from me, how did you get them?! This jewelry is mine, it was taken from me! Mine! Yes, it was stolen! They killed my husband! My husband was killed! I bought the jewelry myself in Pest. It is my wife's! Let us go, Henriette. Hey now, don't you cry, Henriette, I won't ask you how you came by this jewelry. All I’m asking of you is not to cast me as liar. Now... I lied for your sake, telling them I bought it. Thank you, Lenard, you're so good to me. Forgive me, I’ll be different from now on! Good. Naturally, I’ll send the jewelry back to that unfortunate lady. Look, did you capture Fatia Negra by any chance, judge? Not yet, but I’m on the right track I believe. Perhaps you'll end up being the lucky one. Oh, my apologies, Henriette, let me introduce Mr Vamhidy, our new law officer. I was fortunate enough to make her acquaintance on a social meeting. Please allow me to press on. Duty calls! God be with you! Best of luck! What do you think, Henriette, shouldn't have we invited this Vamhidy over to us? He claims to know you already. Indeed. We used to know each other. Lenard, I’m your wife now, and I’m done wishing to be anything other than that! Fatia Negra... You made me wait for long, an entire week. Do you love me, Fatia Negra? And if I’d sin against you, if I’d cheat on you? I would still love you. I’d shot through your heart out of love. - When will I become your wife? - Soon enough. We'll have our marriage next week down in the Lucia cave, then I’ll go into hiding. The law enforcers are on my tail for a while. We'll destroy the mint, all of us get our yields, we'll break the machines and bury the cave's mouth... And then I’ll take off the black mask, and Fatia Negra will be no more... So I’ll just have to wait one more week. Yes. One week... Caution, brother, don't you set the brandy on fire! - It would be such a waste! - And we would all descend to hell! - Anica and her folks. - The ceremony begins. - Fatia Negra is here! - Fatia Negra has come! Brothers of mine! We've gathered here to celebrate, hear me out! l, the wearer of the black mask, swear on all underground forces of the night, on the angel Leviathan, who was cast down from Heaven due to his rebellion, and I swear on the magical incantations uttered by the snake in Paradise to the first woman, that I shall be faithful to this maiden, I shall never abandon her or else each drop of my blood should be filled with poison, and if I’d betray her, my most trustworthy mate should betray me back! You miserable pretender! You cheated all of us... But no one else so badly than myself! Remember the night at Ice Valley, Juon's cottage! I was present, I heard each of your words! I swore there and then that I shall destroy you! Look there! Behind your back! Lower your arms, everyone! Halt! Fatia Negra, you are my prisoner! Alive, sir! - The bastard's gone! - This way, sir! Help! Help! Lads, break the barrels, douse the fire with beer! Juon, this way! The miser has to be caught! Oww, my eyes! My eyes... Anica! Anica! Anica! Anica! Lieutenant, shut down the mint's entrance! Come on, people! Let us escape this inferno! Stop there! Everyone remains at their place! Leave me! Catch him! Wealth, inheritance? Where are they? Nowhere. You have nothing left! I never told you I do have. - You never even asked. - And why don't you have? Mr Demeter Lapussa has written both of you out of his inheritance, due to your swindling brother who forged representative coins and fled! There's no use staring at me. Like that. Yes, he's a forger of 40 thousand forints. In your name. And where will you get this money now? Am I supposed to repay it? Me? It’s bad enough that you were denied an inheritance, am I to use my money now? Due to a bastard of a kid?! Well I never! How can you talk like that? Why do you hurt Kalman? Who knows what befell the unfortunate soul... He stole and swindled, that's what befell him. He damaged my goods, that's what befell him. Is money worth more for you than the one you love? Why didn't you say so earlier? Why just now?! Now that I finally... Now that I love you too. Hey, don't cry, Henriette. And forgive me for my harsh tone. You see, I’ve suffered serious losses, I’m afflicted. And 40 thousand forints is a helpful sum for sure. Don't be mad at me, Lenard, I cannot help it... And my poor brother Kalman... That representative money carries your name, Henriette. And you carry my name now. That counterfeit representative money needs to be exchanged. Thank you, Lenard! My dear, good husband. I’ll travel to Pest tomorrow. Go ahead, I don't mind. The only problem is that I can't accompany you due to the Arad horse races. Then I’ll ask uncle Gerzson, he'll accompany me. His horses are also featured at the races. - Then I’ll go on my own. - You cannot... The trip is very dangerous. I’m begging you, take out the representative money. I want to take the trip tomorrow by all means. Alright then. I feel bad that you skip the races for my sake. Ahh, my horses run fine without me being there. I’m very grateful that you're besides me, uncle. I’ll protect you, baroness, even against the devil! My old hand shoots in a way that all bullets hit! Why is that kid riding so slowly? We won't make it till dawn at this rate! Haaaw, halt! Who commanded you to halt, hey? We have trouble, your excellency! Two horses began to limp! Jump off and take a look at what ails them. He was arrowed! And him too, for God's sake! Go and check the rest of them! Gosh, the devil should take all the smiths who don't take care of their animals! Where are we now? A long way forward and a long way backwards, baroness. Your Excellency, all four horses were arrowed by the smith! Shite, to the gallows with... My apologies, baroness! What can we do now? The pub! There's a pub not far from here, to the left! The pub of his Excellency, the baron! lndeed! I visited the place once, the tavern keeper is a very decent lady. I’m about to drive the limp horses to the pub, in the meanwhile you fetch new horses and come meet us. - Off you go. - Yes, sir. At your leisure, baroness. - Please, baroness. - Thank you very much. Hey! Anyone! Tavern keeper! Servant! Cook! I wonder why the lady won't come to greet us, she could have recognized the carriage. To the hell with your lot, come greet us already! What kind of a soul is that? He must be a fixture, he was present the last time. Move on if I call for you! I’m a guest myself here, hey! Hey yourself, scoundrel! Where's the tavern keeper? I don't know, the house is vacant. - And the help? - No one is here. I’ve just arrived myself, it is all empty. And are you its guardian now? They shouldn't accuse me of stealing anything: I’ll wait till they come back. Well, old rascal, take this twenty! Forget about being a guest, unwind the horses, bring them hay, water, and haul in our food. Watch out for my rifle, it's loaded. Then do what you please. At your leisure, Henriette. We're lucky that Lenard left us this Tokaji wine... - Just a sip. - No, thank you. - Drink up, uncle Gerzson. - To your health! You neither ate nor drank? The night is still young. It’s close to midnight... The whip may return here in an hour. lf he has any luck... Forgive me. Baroness, I’ve no idea what's up with me... I’m so sleepy, my eyelids keep shutting down... Smoke a cigar, uncle Gerzson, you'll be less sleepy! That I won't... I just need some fresh air. Outside, the drowsiness will leave... leave me... Uncle Gerzson, four men have arrived! Dear uncle Gerzson, wake up, someone wants to enter! Sir, wake up! Quit sleeping! Dear uncle Gerzson, wake up, robbers are coming in! - What, what's up? - Robbers are here! Don't you move! Else you're dead! Drop that rifle. No sword or bullet may harm me. Stay put! Here, my cash and my jewels! That's not what we want. You received 40 thousand worth of representative money from your husband. Give us that! I don't have it, I mailed it away. Lady, let's get this over quick: remove the steel sheet from your shoulder pad that you fastened the writ to! And give me that. Seize her! Grigor, bring out the woman, but be careful with her! Harness the horses! You ride home to Hidvar, you'll be escorted, if you try to deter from the route, you'll be killed! Get to the horses! Make her sit down. But take care of her! What about the other one? Once he wakes up, he's free to go wherever he wishes. My horse! What's this, are all the rascals asleep? Indeed, the baroness s in the castle. - But how did she make it home? - She was brought by her whip. He claims that Fatia Negra's gang followed him right to the border of Hidvar. And Hatszegi? He's reported through an emissary your disappearance. Is the baron in the castle as well? He embarked somewhere in the morning and commanded us not to let anyone in the castle. Why? It is rumored by the castle staff that the baronette... has gone mad. Fatia Negra... Sir, this minor here committed a fraud. He was renting a room that he prepared to leave without paying for it. You may leave! Kalman! Kalman... Sit down here. What happened? Dear sir, first of all I’d like to ask you not to call me Kalman. - But... - I have no family. Therefore I don't have a family name either. I am Leander Baberosi. - Leander Baberosi. - That's right, sir. I made up my mind about becoming an actor, an artist. That's a noble and high goal, dear Leander. And the relatives? I’m all done with rich people. I grew to hate my relatives, all of them groveling in front of an old man so that he won't cheat them out of 1000 forints or so. Mr Demeter Lapussa no longer lives. Is he dead? Well, that makes Mrs. Langai and Mr. Janos natural antagonists with each other. They're involved in a civil case that includes your name. But I don't intend to know them anymore, I am my own master! That is quite neat, dear Leander. However, you committed a haphazard act which can easily render you under a new master... True, I committed quite a few stupidities. But nothing of the sort that I wouldn't confess. They're talking about a certain representative money that you commissioned in your sister's name. And did Henriette refrain from taking it out? She was ready to accept this signature. But her grandfather had written her out of all and any inheritance and she's not ready to present such a tremendous sum. Dear God... So the mighty lords call this a tremendous sum. Kalman, we're talking about 40 thousand forints! What? Forty thousand? I’ll kill him! I’m going to kill the bastard! - I’ll murder him! - Who do you want to kill? Let me go! That Margari, that damnable wretch! - Kalman! - I’ll kill him, kill him... Kalman... sit down. Man up... don't cry. And now tell me the whole story. When I left my grandfather's house, I needed at least 20 forints to be able to flee. Margari promised me that he'll get me as much, but told me that I'll have to undersign for 40. Later on he told me that the moneylender won't give any unless Henriette signs it too because I’m still a minor, and he's already married. And you undersigned your sister's name. Margari urged me to it... since 40 forints is nothing! What's it worth to Henriette? lf I’d ask her, she'd lend me 10 times as much! 40 thousand forints... I’m about to hang myself! That would be your biggest foolishness. You'll have to assume responsibility for your deed as well. But Margari and another person that I only suspect at this point... I’m sure they will pay a bigger price. No, no, no, no, no! I won't cover anyone else! What do I have to do about the activities of my staff and servants? Hey now, Mr. Lapusa, Margari is the kind of confidante who used to handle your money too. That's right, sir. Mr Lapussa has to assume responsibility for me. I won't assume it. You're a crooked rogue! You forged representative money! What now? Your excellency commanded me to! Yes he did, I just followed his orders. Now he pretends that he doesn't know anything! - You lied, blackguard! - You are the blackguard! I’m just a tiny blackguard. - You bastard! - You bastard! Silence, please! Gentlemen! One is ill-advised to resort to dirty deeds as their own hands will remain dirty in the process. I hereby arrest you both. Take them away. Mademoiselle! Do not fret, I am Anica. I’ve come to beg you, your excellency. I was told that a mixed jury is about to be set up in the case of the coin forgers and his excellency the baron shall be its president. Mylady, I beseech you to talk to your husband: make him find it in his heart to act merciful with those people, including my father, they are not the main culprits here! Out with you! Out! How did you enter here? No one should disturb the baronette! The baron forbade it! SlR! YOU ARE THE JUDGE OF AN UNFORTUNATE GROUP, PLEASE BE MERClFUL TO THEM, DO NOT CONDEMN THOSE WHO ARE THE MOST lNNOCENT SOULS. HENRlETTE. Dear Henriette, have you read ,,The Mysteries of Paris''? How did you like the description of the mental asylum? Your behavior is getting strange lately. The whole neighborhood is gossiping about you becoming crazy! I was being asked of this multiple times. And I keep answering that it is untrue. But if I happen to utter that it is actually true, you can rest assured that you'll end up in the asylum! You are to present yourself at tomorrow's trial. Be cautious about how you behave. For the minting and distribution of forged gold coins, the mixed jury condemns Grigor Onuc, as the ringleader of the forgery gang, to the forfeiture of all his wealth and goods and to 20 years of dungeon imprisonment. I won't allow it! I won't allow it! That goddamned Fatia Negra is the root cause of all this, and now you all bear false witness and conspire against my father! It is not true! Not true! Not true! I won't allow! Silence! Great baron, I beseech you from my heart to be merciful: I was the one to endanger my father! With my love towards Fatia Negra! And I betrayed him due to my hatred towards Fatia Negra! Fatia Negra escaped and are they to suffer instead?! I won't let my father go! I won't let, I won't let! Silence! That's enough! Take her out of the hall! I won't let my father go! I won't let! I won't let... Baroness! You be damned, Fatia Negra! May the skies fall on you, devil spawn! It’s him! He is Fatia Negra, don't you all see?! Indeed... She really is ill... Gentlemen, the results are reassuring. Eight men of Fatia Negra are our prisoners! Perhaps we are on the right track. I hope I’ll be able to bring more tomorrow. As I said, I’m ready to employ the county forces, if needed. Even three counties! Gentlemen, I’m counting on you too. Naturally we will support you to our best abilities. Good luck to you! You can always count on me. WANTED FOR 5000 GOLD: lN COUNTlNES ARAD, MAROS, TORD A AND KOLO Z S, THE VlLLAlN FATlA NEGRA... What did they write on it? They're looking for Fatia Negra. He's worth a 5000 gold reward to them. I don't want the money. I want his head. - For my eyesight. - For my father. For my ruined life. They're sniffing our traces. The officers need to be killed! - All of them! - Quite a task, domnule. Law officers don't kid around, we shouldn't bother them. They're a better shot than we are. They're adepts in manhunting. What's this, are you scared? You shouldn't fret, I am here with you! You are, sire, but your head ain't our head! They captured seventeen of us. We'd rather hide away while they clear out. Cowardly dogs! Go ahead and hide away then, don't let the wind make you chill! Scram! I’ll show it to all of you that law officers are mortal! Are you sure you didn't dream what you told me? Sir, a blind man is never sure if he's dreaming or awake. - But Anica was present too. - Yes I saw and heard it too. Take care of yourself, sir, Fatia Negra is rallying against you from now on. And I don't feel like urging you once again. Make yourself ready by dawn, I’ll be back by then. All I have to do is a little showdown... with someone. Au revoir, Madame! Kill him, kill him... kill him! Henriette dear, you shouldn't excite yourself! Don't you cry, you'll come back here! It’s a good thing to see more of the world, a journey is always wonderful, and aunt Clementine will accompany you! Indeed. Calm down. You'll have a headache. Should I give you a pill? Or should I bring something? Some fruit juice. Fruit juice, right, darling, some fresh strawberry juice. No! You should prepare it, aunt Clementine. It tastes the best when you prepare it. - Istvan! - At your command, baronette. Run after Clementine into the kitchen and tell her not to use strawberry but raspberry for the juice. Yes, but the baron commanded me to... Didn't you hear me?! Off you go! - Who's that? - Open the door, reverend! What happened, mylady? Help me, reverend, it's a question of life or death! - Life or death? - Vamhidy... Fatia Negra is about to kill him! The law officer is not alone, 1 2 officers are with him! But sit right down here, milady, you're trembling. Where did he go, which way? Past the millers towards the Bald Peak, he said. He'll kill him, I know... Let's hurry on! Milady, it's dark, it's nighttime! Let me go! All of them are asleep. Someone mixed devil snare in their drinks. You see, Fatia Negra's reach is distant... Do your pistols work fine, sir? Someone broke them. It’s got beeswax in it! - I’ll be damned! - Here, I’ll clean it. Is your sword sharp, sir? I can hear Fatia Negra's footsteps. A fine sword. Sir, let's go to the bridge, he needs to cross it. Don't be afraid, sir, I’ve damaged the bridge. Cut his neck with it, sir, nowhere else but the neck. He wears a chainmail that no bullet or blade can enter. Don't defend, he'll just kill you then: just attack! Strike hard! Can you hear it? He's coming... His pistol is wet, now is the time to assault him! Ouch! Fatia Negra, stop there! Be careful, sir! I’ve cleaned it! - Did you fill it? - I did. - After them. - You stay behind, Juon! After them! I’ll follow them to the depths of hell. Fatia Negra, stop there! Can you hear ir? It’s shorter this way! Fatia Negra, surrender! Surrender! - Here's his blood! - Let's hurry up. This way we'll cut them off! Stop there! Sir, 5000 gold reward is on my head... - I’ll send you 20 thousand. - I won't bargain! I want your head! You'll die here, Fatia Negra! No! Do you all want my head then?! This head? My head? Here you are. Henriette... were you aware of this? The poor rich... THE END
