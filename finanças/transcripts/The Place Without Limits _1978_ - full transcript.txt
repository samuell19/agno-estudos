First, I'll ask you about Hell Where is this place men call Hell? Under the sky. Yes, but where? Whitin these element. Where we are torture and always remain. Hell has no limits. It can't be restricted to one place. Hell is here where we are... ...and here where Hell is we must remain. DR. FAUSTUS THE PLACE WITHOUT LIMITS It can't be. It cant't be. Child, wake up. I heard it. Can it be? Don't you hear? It's Pancho's truck. You think he'll come? I knew this would happen. He said one day he'd return. Don't be scared, Dad. Of course I'm scared. He's a brute. Everything's locked? You barred the door? Everything's locked up. He can't get in. We can't open tonight. Now he's leaving. What if we open later? Oh, Dad. Go to sleep. It's too early. How do you want me to sleep? Don't be silly. - Then calm down. It's no big deaI. I always knew he'd show up. But I deluded myself thinking... ..."maybe he'll never come back". It's 7 in the morning. Go to sleep. Don't be such a chicken. It drives me crazy. How do you think I can sleep? Oh no. - He's gone. I don't hear his truck. Maybe he won't come back. Sleep. You can do it. OK. Alright. Stop your none sense. It's just that I'm so nervous. Sleep if you want to. But hold my hand. Howdy, brother in law. You don't say Hi? Boy, Pancho! How long... ...have you been away? About six weeks. No, two months. And those rags? What? We're still gonna be panhandlers? No way. It's just that I drove all night. Look at me. I was born poorer than you. Do I go around all filthy? No, that's true. - I'm telling you. Now you even own your truck. Give him something. He hasn't eaten. Yes, boss. I'm late, but I wanted to say hello... ...before going home. Can it be that you went to see the girls? Look, since you're already filthy... ...why don't you move those containers? Sure. - If you can. Which ones? - The ones outside. You bet. - Let's see. Fucking Olivo. Look at that. He's deader than... Before the rains, I'll grab... ...the gasoline pump and... Here I come. To hell with this town. I won't be that last one to leave here. There they are. Where can I wash my face? This fucking life is over. One works for something, right? My new gas station is doing fine. How's Emita? It's good of you to mention her... ...because I wanted to tell you something. It's time you and your wife... ...improved yourselves. If only... ...because she's my sister. How much do you have? Not much. I took up some jobs, but the pay is awfuI. Emita saw a house. 30 thousand pesos cover the down payment. I'll be your collateraI. It's a very nice house. I promised her I'd convince you. You'd convince me of what? What else? To use the money you brought for the down payment. And the truck's monthly payments? You know how Don Alejo gets. You're almost done. You've been paying him. Sure. What d'you think? Sit down. Let's go right now to San Juan... ...and give your wife the news. No, wait. Today it's Saturday. The train comes. It stopped coming? - Once a week. The office is open for the sale of that place. Come with me. Let's go to San Juan. I'll get an eye-shutter. You'll see, Pancho. We won't be poor anymore. Your wife and you can't go on sleeping... ...in the other room in the house. I don't want my kids in my bedroom anymore. They're grown up and they spy on me. You move too much, you're too noisy... ... like an old goat. - You're the goat. We must start living like decent people. Shave before going to the store. I'm not going. - Why? Don Alejo is bound to show up... So? Are you scared? I'm not scared of anyone. You don't want anyone to see you with me? Don't say that, brother-in-law. That old motherfucker is a cheat. If it weren't for Don Alejo, I wouldn't be selling. He wants to rid the town of people. Not even an animaI sleeps as fast as you. I promised myself... ...not to sew the red dress. Not to darn it. If I never fixed it... ... Pancho wouldn't come back. But he did. See what that beast did to me. That's too fucked up. You think? - It's a rag. I think the folds can cover it a bit. I don't have red thread. Bastard. It's more than a year that he tore it. You were provoking him, right? Yes, I liked him. You think not? Such a hunk of a man. I really thought he was good. A brute, but good. With those big hands. If he comes, he'll ask you to dance. He has no balls. Just to make trouble, like the last time. If it weren't for Don Alejo... I'm not a coward, but I saw his face... ...he wanted to do to me who knows what. Dance if he asks you. It'd be worse... ... if he does who knows what. - Never ever. I don't dance for that brute. I do that just for my friends. For the gentlemen. Not for a lowlife like him... ...whose feet stink. I don't have red thread. Cloti. Cloti. Listen. Manuela. What? - You have red thread? No. What time is it? It's late, Clotilde. I think it's early. No way it's early. Get up. Make me some coffee. It's the only thing you're good at. Lucy. Disgusting. - Manuelita, what is it? Don't Manuelita me. Darling, let me sleep. I'm sure you have red thread. Give it to me. You fell off the mattress? Hey, Pancho is in town. And since he made some threats... You have to be very carefuI. Lest he disfigures you. And all because in this house... ...there's no man to protect us. Let me make myself pretty, OK? It's all yours, darling. Thanks, angeI. You know what, Manuela? - What? Someone gave us the eviI eye. Don't scare me more. When I saw Cloti coming... ...into this house, i thought: "A sad bitch is bad luck". It's just that she's old. When did she arrived? Just a month ago, and look. Why didn't you warn my daughter? I don't want to be called a bad friend. I told the Jap: "Child, this will ruin... ...the prestige of this house". Lucy, you're living in a pigsty. Jap, the fat man that came last... ...made a mess of my room. Tell her about the eviI eye. Yes, it's Cloti. I think she brought us bad luck. You think that's true? Can we get her out of the house? At least for a few days? No, Dad. Don't be mean. The poor thing is not to blame. And you, Lucy, cut it out. What? I'm just saying it for the good of the house. Jap, what if it's true about Cloti? You, stop being such a pig. And you, come out here. Tell me, Japan. Don Alejo sent me a message last night. He'll be at the store. He wants to talk to me. He says he has some good news. What can it be, my God? He got what we wanted. You think? I don't believe it. It doesn't matter if you don't. I'll tell Don Alejo... ...to protect us from that animaI. Yes, my precious. Only he can help us. Manuela, here's your coffee. She should call him Boss. She's new here. Yes, Cloti. I'm coming. Poor Skinny. First you defend her... ...and now you want me to scald her. Cloti darling, you said you didn't have thread. No, Manuela. No sugar, so you don't get fat. You're so good. Look, my daughter wants you to call me another way. Just in front of her, understand? Boss. Call me boss. Between you and me, it's nicer to call me Manuela. Hey! This is no time for you to be here. Who do you think you are? - Don't get mad, Jap. I didn't want to stay here, but I fell asleep. No, no. We must settle another account. I've nothing left. I gave you all last night. If you think this is a hoteI, pay as in a hoteI. It's 60 pesos. - I'd have more fun... ...with you, but you... ...never want to, you're so serious. I'm a whore like the rest, but... ... I choose who I do it with. That's for sure. - Now pay. 50 is alright? Be nice, Jap. Give me a break. - Don't call me that. The Japanese was my mother. The great Japanese. Call me whatever you want, except that. I have no money left. Next time, it'll be 60 pesos. More if there is electricity. She's angry. If my daughter asks... ... I went to Ludovina's to get red thread. And other little things. We'll talk later. Well, see you later. Go on. See you later. Why is she so nasty? What's wrong with her? - What else? She doesn't get off on old men. That's why she resents us. Ludo? Surprise! - Ay, Manuela! You scared me, woman! You're more deaf and prettier every day. You'll see when you're my age. May your mouth rot, you old bitch. Darling, do you have red thread to lend me? That's not to lend, but to give away. You'd give me back the empty cartridge. You're so nice, Ludito. Giving me the red thread. Here it is, right? - You're so smart, child. Look for it yourself. I can't see anything. How many different reds! Tell me about Don Alejo. Look, those were Blanquita's threads. But since she hasn't a head for sewing anymore... ... Don Alejo let me take them away. Poor Dona Blanquita, she went mad... ...since her little angeI went to Heaven. There are lots in there, if you want them. Look for them. - She's worse than me. I got them, Ludito. I'm choosing them. You're so smart, Manuela. So intelligent. Too bad you like... ...those eviI men. You'll never get to be as old as me. By the sign of the Cross, you witch. Hey, hey... Speaking of bastards, in Don Alejo's house... ...they say anything about Pancho? Pancho? - I don't know any Pancho. How forgetfuI. Pancho, with the hands like stone. The one that tore my dress. I don't know him. Besides, what did you expect... ...from those men? They just... ...go to the whorehouse... ...and they're all eviI. I didn't use to like them, but now... ...since there's no people left in this town... ...at least they're here. And Cloti is very good. Remember Pancho. With the truck. You're too old to be thinking of men. I'm still young. Tell me about Cloti. That poor Skinny is very good. Yes, very skinny. Poor thing. She loves you very much. She says you let her... ... stay there. - Why, yes. I said if Cloti didn't make it in the parlor... ...she could stay as a maid. But at night, when they have drunk... ...someone is bound to go with her. You're mean. You like them... ...but you're not going to take them all. No. Just one. Don't worry. He owes money to Don Alejo. Who? What money? The one you said. - Pancho Vega? The same. - How do you know? What are you doing to your finger? Nothing. How do you know? I know him since he was a kid. You're not confusing him? No. His father was Don Alejo's oldest servant. But he loved Pancho very much, as if he were... ...his own kid, and always took him... ...by force to the big house. The kid didn't want to go. I gave him candy. He didn't like it. He had to play with Moniquita... ...the little girI, that he killed her... ...and had to carry her in the cart... ...pretending it was a horse. He didn't like it. He went hiding in the fields... ...but they always found him. And he had to play with the girI. Poor thing, she was always sick. And Don Alejo loves him still? He wants to see him dead. He never wanted... ...to study and be a doctor. One day he left. Some years later, he came back. And then Don Alejo lend him some money... ...to buy himself a truck. That Pancho, so ungratefuI... ...he has never gone to visit him. Why do you eat so little, Alejo? Not true. I did eat. You were distracted. Yes, sometimes I'm distracted... ...but I can see that you didn't touch that plate. I ate bread and butter. You didn't see me. It's the administrator who's coming in. I don't know how you can tell, Blanca. If you'd spend your time locked up, like me... ...you'd learn to recognize the tiniest sound. You're very intelligent. That's it. You look tired. Don't work too much today. Don Alejo, the administrator's here. I'll see him. Bring more coffee to my study. Yes, sir. - Just drink one cup. Good morning, Enrique. - Good morning, Don Alejo. More problems today? I'm not in a good mood. You're unwell? - I don't feeI... ...like having problems. But what can I do, with all this papervork? I went to the capitaI. Everything's perfect. The consortium wants to buy at your price. In principle, I mean. The whole township? - Of course. If it isn't the whole thing, to raze it... ... there's no deaI. - It'll soon be ready. The problem now are the inspectors. When they come, we bribe them, but... ...it's hard to justify the Olivo being without... ...electricity, to supply San Juan. They're saying they'll fix everything. That the technicians will... ...get it done in a single day. Nobody will leave with electricity. The only thing left for you to buy... ...is the girls' house. I haven't talked to the Little Jap. But there's no problem. If she refuses to sell... ...we'll close her down for scandaI or something. You'll close her down in a jiffy. The girI will listen to reason. If not, the law is behind us. She's cooI. She won't be a problem. And these papers? You brought them before. It's for your will. We have to do that some day. I'm not in the mood today. It's simple, since there are no heirs... Of course there aren't. That makes it easier. Excuse me. I didn't mean to upset you. I don't like talking about wills. If you were my age, you'd know why. I've struggled to keep this patrimony... ... that I took from no one... - Good day. Good morning. - Excuse me. Let me tell you another thing. Sit down. This belonged to my father and my grandfather. They tried to reduce it, with laws, at all costs. I made it grow, instead of reducing it. That loan to Vega for a truck... ...is still undocumented, right? It's a speciaI case. I saw his truck in town. Pancho's truck? Pancho. He hasn't come in ages. You must to look for him, Alejo. Take the girI. She'll have fresh air. Thanks for the coffee, Blanquita. We have a lot of business. It's a nice day, and Moniquita enjoys... ...playing with other kids. Alright, enough of that. Enough, Blanca. Pancho is such a ice kid... ...and the child likes it when he tows the cart... ...and Moniquita gets fresh air. I'll see to it. Just give me a moment. Yes. I'm sorry for the interruption. Don't let your tigers loose, Don Alejo. They won't touch you, unless I tell them to. I'm not after you. I don't lose hope. You should be in jaiI, for hanging around beasts. You don't look too good. You were partying. At your age. I've warned you. Why are you in such a hurry? Who are you after now? Nobody, Don Alejo. I'm being a saint. Virgin and martyr. - Be carefuI. A dog worse than these two is loose. You saw Pancho? - When he catches you... ...he'll give you one hell of a beating. No, please. Don't scare more. He twisted my arm, remember? He was going to twist my neck. If it hadn't been for you, he'd disfigured me. And you don't know what he's saying now. What? Tell me, tell me! Things. I don't know. What? Please! Reynaldo must know. Tell me, Reynaldo. What is Pancho saying? That he's gonna ride you good. The Little Jap as well. And if you live... ...you'll see what's good. No, it isn't true. You want to scare me. Look, Manuela, don't be scared. I'll protect you, OK? Really, Don Alejo? Forget about it. I'll tell Pancho... ...to respect you. He will, because I say so. Period. - Thank you. You're a saint. I've been thinking. I don't know what you and... ...your daughter are doing in this hopeless town. If I buy your house, you an leave. Don't joke, Don Alejo. No. I mean it. I'll buy your house tomorrow. We'd go away from those criminals. You see? Troublesome. I've things to do. We open only once a week. The work piles up. In San Juan, they tell tales to my wife. I'll tell your brother-in-law. What's up? What's up? - You won't tell, right? Do I look like a snitch, or what? Go on. - He's your sister's husband. Don't you know dog don't bite dog? That's my brother-in-law. There it is. - Like a sailor on land. With your truck and your transport business... ...a woman in each port. Your wife never sees you. She doesn't complain. And you? - If you're so horny... ...go to the Jap's house. They won't let me in. For making trouble. The worst thing is, I'm in love. Sure. I went to schooI with the Jap. She was good. All the girls loved her. The teacher too. but she played hokey... ...whenever she could, and didn't play with anyone. Hi, Lila. I'm not in love with the Jap. Who then? Manuela, of course. Filthy men, degenerates. Shame on you. She's so lovely! Hello, Don Alejo. What's up, Reynaldo? Don Alejo, Don Alejo. Don Alejo. - Look, Jap... ...excuse me, but I'm busy. You told me to come here, didn't you? Yes, child. We'll talk later. You'll put the electricity back on, right? Little Jap, it's good news. We'll talk later. Cespedes. - Good afternoon. Hi, Lila. - Hello, Don Alejo. It's a miracle, Pancho. Put it back. - You're a joker, Don Alejo. Answer when someone greets you. Those jokes aren't right. What about your jokes? You lowlife! You think I don't know why you're here? I got you the alfalfa business. But I called the company a few days ago... ...to tell them to stop dealing with you. Let's talk somewhere else. You don't want them to know you're a crook? Who's this? - Octavio, my brother-in-law. The one who's selling the gas station. At your service, Don Alejo. I'm more blind each day. Sometimes it's better. I mean that for you. - Elsewhere. I'm his brother-in-law. Talk in front of me. Not here, please. - What? On top of being ungratefuI, you're a coward? Don't say that, Don Alejo. Your father wouldn't stand it if I talked like that. He was a man. Look how his son turned out. For your father's memory, I lent you the money. That's why I don't put you in jaiI. You hear me? I didn't sign any papers. How dare you? I have here all the payments. And that'll appease me? You think I don't know why you're here? My eyes are failing me, but I can see at night. I know you just as if I had spawned you. Sure, the transport deaI is off... ...so you crawI back here... ...to get it back... No. UngratefuI. Give me that money. Give it to me. - I'm not ungratefuI. What are you then? A thief? Cut it out. Don Alejo. I'm waiting. Alright. You're missing 6 payments... ...to pay me all back. I hope you pay me on time. Be carefuI. I warn you. I have many threads... ...in my hand. just because you didn't sign... ...a paper, I'm not letting you rob me. I gave you freedom, to see your reaction. But it's in vain with you. You're a brut. To think that I once thought... ... I could make a master out of you. Send you to college. I should pity you. Forgive me, Don Alejo. Enough of that. Next time... ...you're in trouble... ...and can't pay me, don't hide. Tell me. I was busy. - You lie. I hadn't been able to come. More lies. I forgive your stupidity, because... ...you were born like that, not your lies. They told me they saw you in San Juan... ... 2 or 3 times this year. You forgot the way? Would it kill you to traveI a few miles more? An animaI can go back to the place... ...where it has been fed. Don Alejo, you'll talk to the company to get me... ...the transport deaI, right? If it was so important, why couldn't you... ...deaI with me straight? Well, you know. I need that deaI. We'll see. But since... ... I don't trust you now, go round the house... ...to sign those papers. I'm too old now... ...and I don't wanna die leaving unfinished... ... business. - Don't tell Dona Blanquita. I wouldn't. That poor woman... ...loved to see you around... ...when you were such an altar boy. Give her my regards, please. Now you made me feeI bad. Let's go, Reynaldo. The day is long and I'm already tired. I almost forgot. It seems you're talking a lot of nonsense... ...about Manuela. That you have her sentenced... ...and I don't know what else. Don't let me hear... ...you've gone to the Jap's house... ...to bother them. They're good people. You've been warned. Can I have a moment, Don Alejo? Later, child. I'm too tired. At another time. - Alright. But don't forget. You heard what he said? Don't mess with my father. Or me. You cry like a girI. - Shut the fuck up! Let me go! What's wrong with you? I'll kill you, if you don't shut up! You're hurting me! You! How dare you talk to me? Let me go! Fucking old man! Don't say that. He's good. How do you know? He's good to us. He behaves. He said he'll put the electricity back on. He had it disconnected. That way, the town empties out... ...everybody leaves. That's a lie. - He can buy it all... ...and sell it again. Pancho, why do you say that about Don Alejo? God punishes the ungratefuI. I'm not ungratefuI. He wanted you to study. But you wouldn't listen. What do you mean? I listened to him. I didn't have a head for numbers. I couldn't deaI with those fucking numbers! I'm not ungratefuI. Don't cry, cunt. Don Alejo will regret it. You don't say that in front of people. It's humiliating to be called stupid. I'll kill you if you tell anyone... ...you saw me crying. And you remember what the old man said. That you shouldn't bother me and Manuela. Why would I bother you? Pancho, let's go! Love, you're leaving me... ...you betrayed me. Love, I'd like to be... ...the first one. My fataI destiny has chained me... ...to a crazy love... ...and that's my sin. I'm a flower from the mud. That's my sin. Without knowing why... ... I've poisoned myself. Pancho. Pancho. It's me. Wake up. Emita. - We need to talk. What about? Wake up first. I drove all night. Come here, sit down. Are you mad at me? I didn't go to San Juan... ...because I wanted to shave first and... ... clean up a bit. - Wait, please. How's the kid? - Fine. My sister-in-law will feed him... ...because I came out here. I missed you. Tavo told me what happened with Don Alejo. Old fart... You finally paid him? Yes. - You had lied to us. The old man is very hard. I wanted to give you that money... ...for that house you want. The one Tavo told me about. All this time you didn't pay him a cent? I thought he'd forget. Tavo says the house you want... ...is painted pink. That they're all alike, in many colors. There are no pinks left. What color are there? Blue and yellow. Pancho, it was so easy to pay him... ...once in a while and win him over. If you told him about the house, he'd wait. That old man wouldn't wait. Ay, Pancho. Enough of that. Come here. Tavo wants to talk to you. Octavio. Why do you call him? Tavo, come here. You told him? No. You tell him. I'II lend you the money they paid me... ... for the gas station. - For my house? Forget about the house. To pay off your debt with the old man. Let him know who he's dealing with. But he didn't ask for more. They're monthly payments. In this family there are no cheats. We must shut him up. Since you're my sister's husband... ...and in my family there are no crooks... No fucking town boss will offend us. My brother is right. Don't embarrass him. Change. We brought you clean clothes. I'll take Emita to San Juan. Then we'll go see the old man. Or else, you can forget this is your family. Emita, let's go. See you later. Next time, I'll do your hair like Sarita MontieI's. You always promise new things... ...and you do my hair the same way. I know why. - Tell me. You don't know any other style. I'll admit I do this one very well. The Great Japanese taught me... ...when I was her husband. Ay Manuela, you're disgusting. Don't think the worst. The Japanese and I were great girlfriends. And the Jap? She came from an egg? I don't know. - You were sleeping... ... and didn't notice it. - Yeah, right. You're the one who's distracted. You didn't notice what they put inside you. I'll put these hairpins inside you. See what you did! Help me... ...pick them up, crazy bitch. Don't joke with me, Manuelita. Searching in the dark. We're screwed. Why are they on the floor? Your mamma dropped her teeth. It must have been yours. My mamma is dead. She loved you well. I don't like those jokes. - Your daddy then. My poor little mamma. She'd be very happy, if she lived. Don Alejo brought me good news. He told you about the house? No, I couldn't talk to him. He said he had good news. He knows I want to have electricity. By the way, the batteries for the record player. Your poor mamma, how happy she would be. Yes, if we left this place. The Japanese wouldn't leave this house alive. Stop talking about the past. I'm already too melancholic. Me too. I get angry when they say... ...she died because she drank too much. It was sadness. Because the town was in darkness. Stop talking about that. I'll decorate the house... ...like my mother used to. It'II look so pretty... No, my child. Let's think about selling. It's so dark, it seems like a wake. Who said anything about selling? That's what Don Alejo wants... ...that we sell him the house. You're crazy. Don Alejo will put the electricity... ... back on, like before. - No, I tell you. Isn't that right? He wants everybody... ...to leave the Olivo. To buy their houses. That way he can negotiate whatever he wants. This is the only house he hasn't bought. Shut up, Dad. - I'II leave. Your father is a faggot, but he's not mute. He'll have his say. - He's drunk. You wish! I'm not drunk, man or woman. I'm as sober as a judge. I won't miss the opportunity of saying that... ... I gladly go away from this pigsty. What'd Mamma say if she heard you? You're mother is resting now. Who knows where. But we are alive... ...and tonight we close. That way, the rabid dog won't come in. That Pancho. And tomorrow, we sell... ... Don Alejo even the last brick. The house is also mine. I'm not selling. Besides, the good news isn't that. You're such a sucker! You're a sucker, you old faggot! Thanks. - If this house is a pigsty... ...you're the one to blame! You're wrong. A queen always cheers up a brotheI. Yes, a funnier queen. And not so old. Don't ever say that to me again. You're picking up a fight. And you'll get it, you'll get it. Get out! Open the place, it's late. I won't. - This is not... ...the first time you get ditched. You used to be all the time with that Pino guy. Now that he's gone, what? You'll be in your room all alone? Open up, Jap. You act like a novice. You really loved Pino? It's just that I haven't got many left. He was a bastard. Always beating you. I loved him very much. You'll find another one. You always find another one... ...and badmouth the last one. There are many pimps, but a man like him... He was the pimpest of them all. Forget him. Cheer up. Don't dream he'll come back. Fucking old fart. Let's hurry up and decorate the place... ...or else we'll never finish. There, those sad decorations. Go on, cry-baby. See what I brought. Look. Look at this. - You're tops, little girI. They look like artists. There's a party. - Tonight there won't be... ...men in the house. Alejo Cruz won... ...the elections, that's their pretext. You can come here and talk to me. I had never worked in such a cheap house. It ain't bad. Maybe it's historicaI. Jesus, what a clientele. Darling. I'm glad you're here, girls. The mass is about to begin. Come in. What flutes do you blow? Everyone's. and you? You're a faggot musician. We all are. These are the Farias Sisters... ... Ranchero singers and whores. They sent the other three as reinforcements... ...from San Juan. Mamma Dorita sent them. She has a cold and didn't come. Make yourselves at home. Come in. Go on. You do Spanish Dancing, right? She has no tits. But a good complexion... ...and big eyes. I just woke up. I don't have my make-up on. And those legs must be awesome. Hairy. Darling Jap, can I come in? The dolls from San Juan are here. Come in, woman. Come in, babes. Hi, Jap. - Good afternoon. Good afternoon. - How are you? She's crying. - Good afternoon. You never saw a woman crying? A man has never ditched you? Not today. I'm safe for now. What about yesterday? I have a terrible memory. And this? I didn't recognize you without the Spanish dress. How many pretty things. What a drag to put hang them. And I'm all alone. I can help you. I'm crazy about decoration. You'll help me? - Yes. I'll just take this off. Mamma Dorita has told me a lot about you. AII lies, I'm sure. She says she's half gringa. Is it true? - Who knows. Her arms are freckled. Who knows. And you, Manuela? Where are you from? I'm proud to be from the North. Almost a... ...foreigner like Mamma Dorita. But... ...she's become very tricky. She's old. She's almost 70. Have you seen the blue veins in her legs? Yes. They say her legs were very pretty. If she's too bitchy with you, come here. The truth is, I'm having a good time. You don't mind my asking you something? No. - Why do they call you Jap? You're not Japanese at all. I'm short-sighted. I don't like wearing glasses. To see at a distance I have to squint. You were always a faggot? As long as I remember. The first time was in schooI. With a little boy. I was so in love! I got expelled from schooI. I didn't dare to go back home... ...because my Dad had a whip... ...and even made me bleed. Manuela so crazy. Where did you go, then? Don't be scared, queer. We're all alike. The important thing is that you work hard. And then? Where did you go? I got screwed. Sorry! I went to work in a house... ...with a very good lady. I ran errands. She taught Spanish Dances. Too bad I didn't stay long. I would have learned to dance... ...everything. But a guitarist... ...oh, Jap, what a guitarist... With sorcerer's fingers. How do you know? - You're a cynic. I also know about men, you prick. Guitar players have artfuI fingers. He took me with a Flamenco company. We came here and I stayed crazy... ...in love with a cock raiser from Guadalajara. Now you tell me. - No, another day. Don't be like that. It's your turn. OK, but come with me. So? What then? I was a maid in a pretty house... ...and I wanted to stay there forever. Everything was so tidy. I had been there 3 years and I didn't want to leave. The mistress was very good. What a nice old lady. But the master died and they couldn't pay me. I went to San Juan, to an ugly, cold house. But I didn't stay there. There was another house there, newly painted. But it was a whorehouse. And I started. - You stayed there long? Yes. I didn't want to leave. My bedroom was beautifuI. All filled with pictures from the magazines. But I began to like the Madam's man. And they threw me out. How was he like? - A huge man. I liked that kind when I was young. The kind that stole my money and cheated on me... ...with the first one available. And you came here. Not yet. I went from house to house. 6 months here, a year there. Always packing my bags. I love having my bedroom... ...all tidy, full of decorations. A room of my own. For myself, all the time. Now you have it. Not really. I don't like having illusions. The congressman is your friend. Yes. He owns the house. The rent is cheap. But what if one day he takes it from me? No. I'm too scared of having illusions. Silence, please. Silence! Gentlemen, please! Please. A lady is asking you. Thank you, congressman. I want to announce that among this fine... ...company, there are two young ladies... ...two novices from the city of San Juan... ...from the convent of Mamma Dorita... ...the Farias Sisters. With a hot taiI and cold paws. Let's give them a hand. Won't you go dress up? Later. It'll be a surprise. Go on, already. - No. Not untiI the end. I'm queen of the party. You heard? - You're so hot... ...with those legs and that ass. I think they're false. Don't touch me. - Fucking faggot. No woman puts a hand on me. Much less a faggot. - Sit down. C'mon, man. Get in. GirI. I brought her from San Juan... ...specially for you. You're a good friend, Japanese. Say hello, girI. Good evening, congressman. Good evening. - Look, Don Alejo. What an ass. Try them. Hard as you like it. Pure love. First class. - Thanks, congressman. Sit down, girI. What's your name? Rosita. - C'mon, Rosita. Go on. - I knew you'd like her. How can I not know what you like? Cheers, then. - Cheers, sir. Cheers, congressman. - Cheers. To you, who are the souI of this town. Thank you. - It'd collapse without you. Have a drink. - Sure. Give her some more. She's thirsty. Take care of her. They might steaI her. I will, yes. - As I was saying... ...the municipaI ware houses are small and leaky. Don't say no, now that we all... ...have voted for you. A promise is a contracted debt. Don't be like the former congressman. He got rich and didn't do anything. I don't like the way you talk. Enough. This is a party. Don't bother. If you got us more policemen... ... that would be good. - That too, yes. Manuela. Have you seen Manuela dance? No. - Sit down. Thank you. - You're welcome. Faggot! What do you want, mistress? Dance. - No. It's too early. Don Alejo is dying to see you. They must drink more wine. Go on, Manuela. - I only dance... ...when they're drunk. My triumph is bigger. If you want to warm up first... ... let's go in there. - With you? Coming, Manuela? Whatever you say, Don Alejo. No, woman. I was kidding. I'm not into that. C'mon, Manuelita. Faggot! Queer! Get that degenerate out! Faggot, yes. Degenerate, no. Faggot! Queer! I'm a professionaI dancer. There's no reason to heckle me. If you don't want the show... ...pay me and I'll go. There's a reason one gets hired. C'mon, Manuela. Don't deprive us of the pleasure of your dancing. Didn't you hear these famished dogs? They don't want me. They don't understand my art. Mistress, tell Manuela I'll pay her double... ...from my own pocket, to forgive all these... ... ignorant from Olivo. - You heard him. Go on, take it. For you, who are a father to us all. With him, we'll go up... ...like foam. Dance, Manuela! You're hot! Party as much as you want. It wasn't a female! Fucking Manuela is male! Don't let the women see you. They'll fall for you. I only use this to pee. What does Manuela say? That he only uses it to pee. That's what he says, but I don't think so. Why? - Let's go, boss. Before I also jump in the water... ... with this heat. - Why'd you say that? If I wanted to, I'd make a man out of Manuela. No. - It wouldn't be the first... ...faggot I straighten up. Remember Pino? What do you think? The one that skipped with your money? He was a faggot? Yes, a reaI queer. Don't tell anyone, or he'll be stuck with that. I thought he was such a macho. To make him work, I had to stick... ...a finger up there. Pimps are... With Manuela you can't, I can assure you. I can't? You have to treat her speciaI. Softly. So that he looses his fear. And becomes a macho. - I don't believe it. You're a bit old. The deviI knows more because he's old... ...rather than for being the deviI. Of course I can. With Manuela, I don't think you can. Let's make a bet. If you wish, but you'II lose. I won't. - Alright. Better in that corner. Alright then. If you're so hot, I'll bet with you. If you make him hot and be a macho... ... I'll give you whatever you ask me. But it has to be in front of me. Me watching and you doing a number for me. What'd you say? - Done. What will you give me? I'm telling you, whatever you want. And if I ask you the Hacienda? You won't. You are smart. You know I wouldn't give it to you. Ask me something I can give you. Or are willing to give. - No, that I can give. Well, then... - What? This house. This house is worthless. I want it. Don't go back on me now. I have witnesses who might say... ...that you don't keep your word. It's a done deaI. Cheers. Cheers. Why are you hiding? To keep them from bothering me. Those rude old farts. Barbarians. I better close. If they hear us, they will come. Did they hurt you? - I'm used to it. They do that when I dance. Motherfuckers. It's as if they were scared of me. You're gracefuI and they get hot seeing you dance. You think? - Of course. They're afraid of getting hot. Disgusting Jap, are you crazy? Can't you see I'm a faggot? Shut up, Manuela. I'll pay you. Don't say no. It's worth it. I'll pay you anything. I need this house more than ever. I want it more than anything else. This town will be upscale. And me and the house with it. I'd hire you always. You'll come all the time. - Yes, Japanese. But I don't like you. If there's no bread, eat tortillas. You eat them, even if you don't like them. Yes, what tortillas, Japanese. With those huge... No, no. I mean it. If you try something, I'll scream. And if I made you a partner? My partner? Yours? - Yes. We'll go 50-50. We'll sign with a lawyer. You and me, as owners. 50-50 in everything. The house and whatever we earn. No one will throw me out? And a bedroom to your liking. But, if I can't? Silly. You just stay quiet. And we fooI Don Alejo. What a mess! Don't think about that. Imagine I'm the macho and you're the female. And the we sign with the lawyer? Yes. Don't believe what I said... ...that Don Alejo wants to watch. I said it to scare you. He wants me to tell him about it. He'll trust my word. I'd like to stay with you, Japanese. Sure, like two girlfriends. How we'd laugh, the two of us. With no problems. I'm tired of all the pimps. How nice that would be. Never having to move away. We both looking after each other. Thank you, darling. We won the bet. I feeI I love you. I love you very much. What are you saying? Just that. That I feeI that I love you very much. Manuela, don't go falling in love with me. In love with you? - Yes. You'd e a man. Me, a man? All men are brutes. I don't want to be a brute. Better be a faggot. That way we're friends. Just friends? - Yes, darling. Don't caress me anymore. Girlfriends... ...don't caress each other. Why not? Just because. That's the price. Don't be too smart. The money. If I had, wouldn't I be just like him? Or is Don Alejo a speciaI brand? A speciaI brand of asshole. You're afraid of him 'cause you owe him money. I can get you clients for your truck. Many trailers come to the gas station. When will I be able to pay you? I'm not greedy, like the old man. You'll pay as you can. No hurry. You're family. The Jap doesn't want me to go see her. Crap! Why not? If you want to and you pay for it. The Jap is his? The old man thinks he owns everything. But no, sire. He's not your boss. Or mine. You bet he's not. Old bastard. He has his own plant. Motherfuckers. I'd shoot them all. CarefuI, they bite. Othello, Sultan, inside. Shut up. Sultan, over here. Who is it? - Pancho, Don Alejo. There's the old man. C'mon, don't be a fag. Jesus, Don Alejo. Your puppies are wild. Are you drunk? - No. Excuse me. Why are you here, so late, making noise? Good evening, first of all. Who's with you? Octavio, my brother-in-law. Remember him? Hello, Don Alejo. - Hello. What do you want? What is it, Alejo? - Nothing. Pancho... ...came to say hello. No. I came to pay you. Pancho is a child. This boy looks... ...like Pancho's father... ...but he's dead, right? Dona Blanca, don't you remember me? Who are you? I don't know you. I'm sorry. - Get in. It's cold, Blanquita. If Pancho's father lived, I'd tell him... ...you don't look after yourself. You barely eat. He doesn't listen to me. Or anybody. It's been a long time. You said you'd pay me? Here you are. The 6 monthly payments. But you already paid me this morning. You can wait untiI next month. What's with you? Why such a hurry? This way you're not worried. He won't need your clients. Well, as you wish. I got him a deaI to transport bricks. Well, he'll get it for me. Whose bricks? Some guys who used to drive by the road. It's cold. - Yes. Winter comes hard for old animals. And for those that go to the slaughter. What are you talking about? Animals. Well, Don Alejo, if that's alright with you... ...we won't trouble you anymore. Besides, with this cold... Good night. - God be with you. Let's go, brother-in-law. Reynaldo, hold the dogs. Let them loose, Reynaldo. Do you need anything, boss? Nothing. I can still manage alone. Lock up the dogs. C'mon. Sultan, Othello. Go on. What's wrong? He's been bothering us all day. He's too old. Poor thing. Let someone else look after him. He's abusive. You have to be patient. No, Reynaldo, I'm leaving. They're finding me a job in San Juan. No, Lupe. You can't do that to him. Why not? - He's very sick. Don't tell anybody. He'll bury us all. No. The doctor in San Juan... ...told him he's very ill. Don't tell anyone. He won't last a year. Don't you think? - What? That you went a bit too far. No way, I'm very happy. Let's celebrate. Where? - The same place... ...you wanna go to. Let's go. Fucking Tavo. This king. It screwed up the game again. Make up already. You get angry and there's not even music. Don't be stupid. If he hears music... ...he'll want to come in. It's all locked up. Why are you afraid? Maybe he'll come again. At least let us hear a record. C'mon, Manuelita. Don't be mean. Why are you nervous? Nobody's looking for you to beat you up. Or for anything else, darling. I'm not nervous. I'm angry. C'mon, Manuela. A bolero. I'm not in the mood. Why are you angry? It's the only day that we have a crowd... ...and you won't open. Lucy, what music will cheer you up? Whatever you like, Japan. TropicaI music. No, no. Whatever you like. I won't forgive you for this, ever. Nely, a cigarette. It's him. What do we do? Dad, don't be scared. Go in and hide. Mother who are in heaven! C'mon. Let's go inside. It'll be OK, if he doesn't see you. Don't let him in, no matter what. Don't worry. I'll tell him to go away... ...without opening the door. For all that you love. Go on. - C'mon. What do you want? - To celebrate. And to get it on. What else? - No hassle. Just drinks and women. That'll do. Manuela went to San Juan. What do I care? Will you let us in or not? Come in. Manuela? - Lucy? Where are you? - Lucy. Here. Be quiet. They're in a good mood. And horny. I'II let you know when they go with someone. And if one goes with you? They want Nely. Nely? And who else? Your daughter. You stay here. As soon as I see they're naked... ... I'll come running to tell you. You'll go to Ludovinia's house. OK? - Thanks, sweetheart. Don't worry. Hide. You must leave your guns... ...if you go into the rooms. We don't want trouble. What guns? We're decent people. Did you hear? Tavo only has a cheap blade. I don't have even that. The music's over? What a lousy whorehouse, without music. Here it goes. What a nice stereo. Well, cheers. So? You want to step on my feet? You're on. I wanna dance with you. But I don't. They say you're a lousy dancer. They say the same about you. Hurry up, brother-in-law. Tavo. That's it. Go on. I dance really bad? Like the rest. You owe me one. Not anymore. You're gonna pay. You're starting to make trouble? Hold your horses. There's no need to be afraid. Tell me what's up. If we're gonna be friends... ...we have to get even first. What did I do to you? You saw me crying. So what? It's my turn to se you cry. I let you in because you promised to behave. You have to keep your word. I don't want trouble. But I'll see you cry. And I'II laugh. C'mon, Tavo. Let's go in. C'mon. C'mon, man. C'mon. Come here. Let me go. Let me go, I tell you! Enough! - What's wrong? Let me go! Let's go inside, then. No. It has to be in front of them. No! - Right here. So they can see. - They're not animals. Shut up! I don't like it when women talk. You're a brute! AnimaI! - Shut up! It hurts. Dance and strip. I wanna have fun. Enough! You're not stripping? You can't dance! Where's Manuela? Where's Manuela? I'm talking to you. She's not in. She's sick. She's in San Juan. That fucking bitch never gets sick. You thought I had come to see you? You fart face, coughing fart face! I came to see Manuela. Call her. Tell her to come and dance. That I want to see her. Tell her to come. Let me go. - Go on, bring her here. I've told you my Dad is not here. If it won't be with her, drop your panties! Coward! You don't keep your word? Yes. I promised to get you tonight. Yes, but right in there. In there, where? - You don't like women. You like making trouble. Here, I tell you! Here! Alright! Right now. Start praying, kids. Let's go! The sick woman got well here. I go out last. I'm the main dish. Sweetheart. And the most delicious. No, Cloti. Don't put that on. Now that I think about it, I'm going to dance... ..."The Legend of the Kiss". Which is even more dramatic. But you have to do it with me. It's a dance where a very beautifuI woman... ...finds a young lad sleeping in the woods. He's very handsome. But he's bewitched. The poor boy can't see or hear... ...can't eat... ...or anything. But then, the legend says... ...he will live again... ...when a very beautifuI woman... ...passes by. In that forest. Where he is... ...kind of asleep. And what the hell do I do? Wait. You stay right here. Manuela, you cunt! - Here. In the middle of the stage. Right. One afternoon... ...a divine woman... ...was picking up flowers in the forest... ...and got lost. Suddenly she sees... ...the most lovely man in the universe. But, what a tragedy!. ...he seems to be all dead. She gets close. Like so. Like so. Ands she looks at him. She likes him so much, that even though he's dead... ...she wants to plant him a big kiss. She gets close. She kisses him. She's going away, when he wakes up. He wasn't dead. He wants her to kiss him in the eyes... ...so as not to be blind anymore. Yes, a kiss in the eyes, for his blindness. C'mon! You have to tell me: "Kiss me in the eyes, my love". I won't tell you anything, fucking fag. if you don't, then I won't dance. Alright, alright. Kiss me in the eyes, old bitch. And so, this divine woman... ...this divine woman... ...not what you said... Hey! And he sees, for the first time... ...how divine she is... ...and asks her to kiss her on the knees. A kiss on the knees... ...so he can walk again. C'mon, asshole... ...ask me. Kiss me on the knees, Manuelita. And so, she, out of her goodness... ...bends down to kiss his knees. But she can't see very well... ...and gets it wrong. Pancho! Manuela, you fucked the most handsome. I've always been like that. I always triumph. Why don't you dance, you silly thing? You should learn from your mother. Leave her. Fucking her mother isn't enough for you? You'll dance with me, right, Cloti? Yes. I've always been a good dancer. But the winner of the evening is me, darling. Right, sweetheart? Without a doubt, my queen. A man must try everything once. Right? - Whenever you say. Don't be a faggot, brother-in-law. What did do? - Don't pretend. I saw you kissing him. How can you say that? Would I let that faggot kiss me? You're crazy. I would never let him. Hey you, did you kiss me? Don't worry, Pancho. Have a drink. Nothing! answer me, faggot! It was a joke. - It's one thing to party... ...and another one that you kiss me! Crap! Take it easy! Pancho! Get on the truck to catch him. They're chasing Manuela. Pancho. - And the other one. Let's go to the cistern. Get her! You'll see! - No! No, Pancho, no! No, Pancho! Pancho! - This degenerate will learn! You'll never mess with me again! Impossible. - I'll shoot if you want. No, wait. He's dead. She's playing dead. Fuck, Pancho! Let's go, before they see us. Hurry up! They killed Manuela. Motherfuckers! Shall I get them? - No, I won't get... ...dirty with those pieces of shit. But I'll see to it that they get caught. In jaiI they'll have plenty of time... ...to wonder if they're so very macho, and... ...to remember that they dared to defy me. What time is it? - It's late. They'll be back? Wait. Here's the truck. They drove by. They'll go on partying in San Juan. My God! I'll die if he doesn't come back. Here we go again. He gets drunk 2 or 3 days. He comes back all beaten up. As always. Let's get some sleep. Perhaps when he returns... ...we'll have electricity. Perhaps.
