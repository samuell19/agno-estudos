Therefore, these people... ...felt the need to leave their homelands... ...to flee in an effort to escape political and social persecution. Hence, the creation that is America.

I thought, when you write... ...you're supposed to be as objective as possible. That is a rule ofjournalism. It is often taught and very rarely practiced. This, however, is a political science course. If you wish to write about objectivity... ...write about its use in modern politics in your view. Hm? That'd make a good paper. I'll write that down. Oh, Christ Jesus. What? In future, Miss Connor, please find your own thesis. I am looking for evidence of original thought. You are not here to simply recycle dates and facts from the past. One's primary purpose at university level... ...should be to learn how to think. [♪♪♪] Now, question: Did you write this paper? You really feel like insulting my intelligence, don't you? I worked my ass off on that paper. I rewrote it three times. -Shouldn't be one misspelled word. -All right, Mr. Williams, I believe you. Are you having problems here at Columbus? It's all right. I got a problem with the way fools be tripping when they see a black face. Someone spit in your face when you first came to campus? Was there a cross burned outside your dormitory? No. I know what you're trying to get at. Just because it ain't up in my face, that don't mean it's not happening. It's less physical now. It's more mental. I gotta run and study, man. I don't see these white folks worrying about nothing but going to class... ...talking about skiing. They don't have the same worries. Then your problem is financial. Not racial, but economic. These type of problems can be worked out. For example, you are a runner, are you not? -One of the best. -A big-time track star, huh? All right. Let us say you are running a race... ...and you suspect the opposing team has a member who is... ...faster, stronger, more big-time than yourself. What do you do then? Do you leave the track?
