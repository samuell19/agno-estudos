This film is inspired by a true story. Characters, locations and incidents are fictitious and created for the sole purpose of entertainment. Lord Buddha once said to Maudgalyayana. There are two kinds of miracles. Anusasani, the miracle of teaching and Ithiriddhi, the miracle of magic and superpower. Buddha endorsed the former but didn't reject the existence of the latter. In 1945, World War II was about to end. The country was bruised and battered. Desperate people took up arms and became bandits. They robbed and killed the rich giving some back to the poor. They were called "The Blackshirt Bandits". That year, I was sent to head the Chainart Police Department. Nong Manong Chainart Province Sir, these Chinese hoodlums must be from Suphan. Members of Jek Ma's gang must've stepped on the toes of Bandit Fai and fled here to cause more troubles. I heard this Jek Ma practises black magic. He can make himself invisible. Radio the district chiefs. Chief! Khun Pan has ordered an attack. He thinks he's the boss? Eat first. Sir! Sit tight. Get down! - I'm out of here. - Get down! Stop! Kill him! Go get him! Don't let him get away. Follow him. Kill him! Over there! Get him! Chief! Chief! - All dead? - Except the women and children. Good. Let's go. Sons of crooks will grow up to be crooks. We can't let them live. Look, we're rich! I'll take you alive if you turn yourself in. I don't think so, sir. You know how the war has made us all poor. Government servants like us can't make ends meet. What we impound from the thieves goes to state coffers. We risk our lives and get nothing in return. Am I right? We pledge our loyalty to the nation and to the people. Being law enforcement officers means you have to follow the rule of law and justice. You have to be ready to wage war on all kinds of crimes and uphold the dignity of the Royal Thai Police. Sorcery is all about arming your mind. To learn this art, you must first free your mind. Find samadhi and concentrate on your faith. Remember, what you believe defines what you see and hear. A great rock is made of tiny grains of sand. Its strength is transient and it will soon return to nature. Birth and death are parts of a cycle, and what remains is energy. To control this energy is to define what you hear and see. Focus your mind on your enemy. See the bullet coming at you. Protect the skin. The flesh. The bones. Ohm! I'm indestructible! Protect the skin. The flesh. The bones. Ohm. Indestructible! Use this power to protect others. Khun Pan actually wanted us on that mission. Luckily we were off duty. Or we could've been in those coffins. Khun Pan is invincible, but his men aren't. He always returned without a scratch while everyone else was dead. Excuse me, ma'am. Your husband was a brave policeman. You should be proud of him. He had such faith in you. He told me that if you ordered him to die he would go and die. Maybe you should be proud of that. Excuse me. I'm from the Office of Inspector General. You're under investigation. Pol. Maj. Gen. Khun Pan chief of the Chainart Police Department has committed excessive and intemperate acts resulting in several deaths of the officers under his command. The extrajudicial killing of Chief Yun was also above his legal authority. The Royal Thai Police rules that Khun Pan is guilty of serious misconduct. Therefore, the punishment is his dismissal from the force. However, since he has a record of commendable services he will be suspended from duty for an indefinite period. Effective immediately. Provincial Police Region One Newspapers! The war is almost over! That's the bad guy. He looks like a bandit. Your coffee, sir. There you go. Happy Retirement, Sergeant Laem Hey, come to the fair tonight. Yes, Sir. Bike safely. A man left a bar one evening fair He'd drunk more than his share Everyone, beware Inn, give me those. Right. Come. Your target. Does the invisible spell really exist? Can you teach me? I want to hide money from my wife. Must be useful on payday. Sergeant Laem, ever misplaced a key? Think about it. Do you think the key is really lost, or you just can't see it? The invisible spell works like that. News of the hour. The Blackshirt Bandits have robbed opium dens around the Central Plains causing huge losses to the concessionaires. Now they've gone into hiding. The police still have no clue where to find them. These bandits think of themselves as tigers. Tiger Fai, Tiger Bai, Tiger Yom, Tiger Mahesuan. And in fact they're as scary as wild beasts. Skilled in fighting and protected by black magic and sacred tattoos. They also know which palms to grease. Low-level policemen like us can't do a thing. Hello there! What's that noise? Firecrackers? Hey, handsome. Yod! Move! The murders of our police officers are an outrageous insult to the law. I promise I'll do everything within legal bounds to bring the murderers to justice. Question. Eyewitnesses said the gunmen wore black and covered their faces. Are they Bandit Fai's Blackshirt gang? Stop right there! We couldn't make any arrest without more evidences. - Don't ask me that again. - Deputy, sir! Go ahead. It's humiliating for the police to be ambushed on their own turf. Will that undermine the people's confidence in the force? I'm a policeman, I don't care about those things. My job is to put bad guys in jail. Deputy Padet, do you have... That's it. Deputy, what's your plan on catching Bandit Ran? Is it true that Bandit Fai is behind this? Strange that they only targeted these guys. What do you mean? I found the victims' photos on the guys you killed. And they were just low-level police clerks. More like accountants. Why did the Blackshirt have to take out these unimportant men? How well do you know these bandits? Very well. I was a doctor in Suphan before. Bandit Fai asked me to treat his men a few times. There are two powerful men in Suphan. Governor Thammarong is one. The other is Bandit Fai, or General Fai. All the top thugs in the Central Plains are with him. But among them... Bandit Fai trusts Bandit Bai the most. When a criminal wants to join the gang he has to put his name on a record book which will be approved by Bandit Bai and Bandit Fai. Bai is the leader of a local anti-Japanese movement. They rob the Japanese and the merchants who cheat the villagers. They steal from the rich and give it to the poor. That's why the villagers cover for them. In short, people have no faith in the police and instead look up to the bandits. Provincial Police Region One Those police clerks took bribes from the bandits. Perhaps they asked for more or broke the deal with them. So the gang sent hit men to whack them. They were a disgrace to the police force. Deputy Padet, do you think Bandit Fai's Blackshirt are behind this? Anyone can wear a black shirt. Fai may or may not be involved. Anyway, I'm glad to see your concern. Don't worry. I'll wage an all-out war against these criminals. You're being suspended. I don't think I can ask you to help. The train carrying weapons and supplies for the Japanese will go to Kanchanaburi by way of Bang Pla Ma at 4.00pm every couple of days. But the next train will be the last one. Last week, I was told to clear the tracks all the way through. Because this train won't make any stop along the way. - Make sure everything's all right. - Yes, sir. We've been robbed! Find it! Hey! Bia! We're dead meat, man. Prepare to fire! What the hell you're doing? Stop it, weasel. Sir, all stolen weapons are here. Good. A bunch of trash! No! Scumbags! Scumbags! Cursed Jap! Don't do it, Jap! Don't do it! Be careful! Drop your weapons! Don't move. No, it's nothing. Kill them all. What are you doing? I didn't do it! I can't control myself! My arms just move. They move by themselves! I didn't do it! - No! - I didn't do it. Bai! Boss. Boss Fai. Bring their bodies back for a funeral. Yes, Boss. What's the matter? Nothing. Let's go. Kamma, where's Mahesuan? He can't make it. But he told us to follow your orders from now on. Fai, Suphan is your territory. Now you've got Bai and Mahesuan under you. That means Suphan, Singhaburi and Ang-thong are all yours. You're becoming too big for your own good. The more powerful you are, the more attention you'll attract. Your Chainart gang has quite a large headcount. If you join us, we'll become untouchable. The authorities won't dare mess with us. Trust me. We should stick together. Cheers. Boss Fai, the Chainart gang may have lots of tigers. But their guns are all rusty, they can't even shoot a dog. Yom, I'll let you use mine. You want to test me? To see if my gun's all rusty? I just want to know if it's true that Tiger Yom is the fastest drawer in Chainart. Enough! If you don't want to join me... I won't force you. Just stick to our own turf then. But if I ever hear that you step on my toes here in Suphan we're not going to be drinking buddies like this again. Let's go. - Drink up. - Have some. Thanks, Bai. I'm Captain Asawin Petchsiri from Department of Special Investigation. I studied special warfare and territory defence in the US. And I fought with the Free Thai Movement during the war, sir. Tell me, they say these bandits have supernatural power how do you plan to catch them? I was trained to believe in science, psychology military strategy and political warfare. I do not believe in fairy tales, sir. Good, I'll promote you as the new police chief of Suphan. Do not disappoint me. Sir! Suphan Buri Province Could you tell me where's the temple that's hosting a merit-making ceremony? Go this way. Cross the canal. You'll see the temple with lots of policemen. Well, well. You came to apologise to me at a ceremony? Where the hell is he? Can you say a prayer? Go and pray at the shrine by the river. I'll see you there. Bai. See you again, love bandit. You never change. My friend, the war is over. The Japanese were kicked out. The Free Thai Movement have come into the open. Those who still love this country should now turn to politics. Fai, join my party. Come work with me. Thammarong. You and I have different ideologies. We've chosen different paths. Which is right and which is wrong, we'll soon know. Tigers! Attack! Go! We mean no harm. Don't try to fight. Who's in there? Open it! Open! Sadhu... May you have a long life. I shall abstain from intoxicants... Found it yet? Yes! Return these title deeds to the villagers. Police! Follow them! Stay here. Who is it? Bai. Use the magic bullet. I can't until I've seen him. Darn it! Dead. He's dead. Thought you could mess with us! Tigers, retreat. Retreat! I shall abstain from intoxicants... Help! The bandits are raiding the governor's house! Help! The bandits are raiding the governor's house! Go! Doctor, I have a question. You told me Bandit Fai used to ask you to treat his men. How did you contact them? There are two ways. First, if you want to go through Bandit Bai go to the temple by the river in Bang Pla Ma. Bai goes there every full moon night to sell the Japanese weapons that he's robbed. Japanese rifles. Cheap and good! - Come take a look! - Show me the Japanese stuff. Here. If you want to fight Tiger Fai these are for you. Bang! He got down, he got up. You fire again! Bang! His flesh is impenetrable, but his insides will be badly bruised. Feels just right. I'll take it. Everything you have. How much? Five rifles and a crate of ammo. 20,000 baht. I was just joking! - 20,000, huh? - No, 30,000. Inflation. Second. Bandit Fai will make a contact if he wants to see you. He'll go through the woman called Busara. She runs the best-known tavern of Suphan The Golden Flower. She's the one who knows all the secrets. If you see him pass by On the horseback, on the fly Don't look into his eyes If you see him pass by His clothes are as black as night His eyes are as furious as fire If you steal something or if you lie Be careful, he'll come and say hi That man is a thorn to my side. Take him out, just name your price. I'll pay you double, Busara. If your intel is useful. Triple. This intel is extremely useful to you. Tell me. Boss Lhong is sending someone to whack you. Let me be frank. What brings you to Suphan? I'll hazard a guess. You don't look like a salesman. You're neither a civil servant nor a criminal. The Golden Flower is famed for our booze our girls, and our trove of information. I bet you're looking for the latter. Good evening, officers. How could you tell? Our regulars don't have a taste for such shiny leather shoes. More drinks? On the house. Have a good evening then. I've seen you before. Have you been following me? This is my table! Get these two puppies out! Who are you? Why have you followed me? You don't know who I am? Good shot. Now tell me who you are. I'm the person who saved you from the Japs at the ruins. My name's Butr. I was on the run to Kanchanaburi. The cops accused me of being a bandit. They killed my wife. So I killed them and ran here. My plan is to find myself a good gun and offer my service to Tiger Fai and Tiger Bai. The more the merrier. Are you Bai? I heard you're a hotshot. My name's Asawin, the new police chief. May I interrupt, Mr. New Police Chief? Here at The Golden Flower the good, the bad, the ugly, and the police have equal rights to enjoy themselves. If you're going to make an arrest, show me your warrant. If you don't have one, then talk to my lawyer. I'm not arresting anyone today. But don't play me for a fool. One mistake, and I'll throw you all in jail. A police chief? Looks like a puppy to me. Hey. My dear customers to make up for the slight disturbance tonight your next drinks are on the house. Let's have fun. Bring more whiskey! Butr, right? You know the golden rule of banditry? Trust no one. And if someone you happen to trust betrays you... you know how it'll end, right? Tubtim! You're drunk! Boss Meng, excuse us. - Enough. Come with me. - Bai! See you around. Bye. Easy. Watch your steps. I don't want to... Sleep now. - No. - Go to sleep. Thanks, Tubtim. This is the only place I can sleep in peace. Bai! Kill them all. I can't control myself! My arms just move. A ghost! I didn't do it! Everyone calls me Tiger Fai. You want to be a tiger too? Yes, sir. If Bai hadn't vouched for you... I wouldn't have taken you in. Ayutthaya perforated amulet. Impressive stuff you've got there. The Blackshirts are coming! Hide! The Blackshirts are on the way! Good morning, folks! The Blackshirts are here! Take your valuable belongings out. Hurry up! The Blackshirts wreak havoc across Central Plains Is it true that the police are intimidated by the bandits in the Central Plains? What kind of police are scared of robbers? Tigers, attack! Tigers or monkeys, they're all worthless to me. I'll put them all behind bars. Bandit Fai and Gang Wanted Dead Please help the poor! - Please. - Go buy some food. God bless you. You're so cheap! Robbing poor villagers! Their clothes are ridiculous. Change them. Yes, sir. Nice. Top Cop Asawin Declares War on the Blackshirts Let the sacred water be the witness. Now we're sworn brothers. We share money. We share gold. We share happiness. In joy and in danger we'll have each other's back. Maybe more? I have a small child. Get it done. Don't worry. Anyone who's drunk this oath water and later betrays his brothers may he die by the sword. May bullets and storms take his life. Even in his death may he burn in hell and never be reborn. We pledge our loyalty to the nation to the people and to our duty. Butr Phantharak You've put your blood stamp in the book. From now on... you're Tiger Butr. And these men... are your blood brothers. Tiger Bai, Tiger Fai, Tiger Butr, brothers forever! Forever! We grow our own rice. We give away the surplus to the villagers or the monks. All of Fai's gang live here? No. It's a village where Bai and myself grew up. The police have no idea about this place. So Fai likes to come here. Repeat after me. - They sell... - They sell... - Loudly. They sell... - They sell... - Silk... - Let's go. - Silk. - Silk. New pots and pans... New pots and pans... So where is Fai's base? You've asked many questions! There's no base, no stronghold. Really? Why would I lie? We live anywhere we want with villagers usually. There are so many tigers in Fai's gang that he has to have a record book. He's smart. He let the villagers spread the rumour that he uses black magic to hide his base. When the police hear this story they chicken out. That's why the cops are always one step behind him. Hey, Bai. - Give me that. - Thieving, huh? These children are orphans. Their fathers are criminals, like us. Some are locked up. Some were shot dead. Fai has taken care of them all. I send them to school. Because if they can't read... the authorities will take an advantage of them. If they grow up to become bandits, they'll end up with Fai. Like Bia and myself. Hi, kid. - Thai Life Insurance - Gather round, folks! This is a new Thai company. - We'll take care of your lives... - Vote for Governor Thammarong Governor Thammarong doesn't give a hoot about the poor. He buys votes and calls himself a representative. That's more like a crook to me. Right. But if you run for election I'm sure people will vote for you. Everyone! We're a Thai company. We're ready to take care of you. The country is going through a hard time. Only Thai people can take care of other Thais. Life insurance will give you security. What's certain in life is uncertainty. Life insurance is a safety net. Don't! Will he make it? You know nothing about Governor Thammarong. Enlighten me. He used to be an influential district chief. He's Fai's friend, they relied on each other. They linked up the state and the criminal world. That's why no policemen dared touch Bandit Fai. Now that Thammarong tried to take him out it means the order came from someone above him. The Central Plains tigers are playing above their weight. How do I pay you for the intel? Just don't die. Not many men like you around. Half of Suphan is mine, the other half is his. If we let him take our part all villagers will become nothing but his servants. When that day comes Suphan will legally belong to that corrupt politician! Taking on the governor... is a tough job. In three days, Governor Thammarong will host a reception for the merchants and wealthy bureaucrats whom he tries to recruit into his party. I've been asked to bring the girls to entertain them. The guests will bring cash to contribute to the vote-buying fund. We'll take the money and kill them all. Governor Thammarong is a good man, now give him a hand Vote for him! He's a good man. Take this. - Thank you. - Go to the poll. Thank you! - Hi, everyone. - I'm Thammarong. Vote for number one! - Good business? - Gather round, folks, young and old. Today the boss wants to have fun Come here, father, mother and son If you want a man who gets things done Please vote for number one Governor Thammarong is a good man, vote for him in the poll We'd like to contribute to the governor's campaign. Thank you so much! That's a lot! I won't let you down. Shoot if you dare, baby-face! Fai, the police! Go, I'll hold them. I want them all dead. Go. Take care of this. I'll go help the Captain. Let's go. Fai's here! He's back! Ming! - Take the money. - Yes, sir. Let's go. Duen, Dao. Dao, Duen! My darlings! It's going to be very noisy tonight, sorry about that! I'll make you mine! Let's go inside. Beside money, I have something else for you guys. Letters! Your wife wrote... "The baby can call your name now." Thank you, Bai. Bad news. Your husband said... "Come pick me up from prison in two months!" Bai. Had the bullet hit me instead of him, would you be sad? Of course. In my life... I made a big mistake once. I won't let it happen again. My life belongs to you. Take it. Sometimes a big change has to come from the roots. We must plant new seeds. What do you want to do when you grow up? I want to be a policeman. A district chief. A merchant. And you? A soldier. Alright. Go to bed now. Why do you want to see me? I wonder who tipped off the police to raid Thammarong's rally. Find the mole. Time for bed. Tubtim seems so deep in love with Bai. Tiger Bai avenged the death of her parents. It was all because of a pack of sticky rice. Tubtim was sold to a brothel. Her very first client was Bai. She had not a dime on her, just a pack of sticky rice. Next morning... Tiger Bai went and kill the men who murdered her parents. They've found that precious thing in each other. They've found love. You sound scared tonight. We're on a tiger's back. It's dangerous. But I'm not scared, not right now. You're telling me you've disobeyed the suspension order and embedded yourself in Bandit Fai's gang? I suspect that the murders of the police clerks must have something to do with Fai's gang. Right now... I know his hiding place. I'll tell you. But promise me that you won't use excessive force. In my career as a policeman I've killed plenty of bad men. But their number never seems to have declined. One day I realised that... giving them a chance could reduce the number of criminals. These people are just misled. All they need is a second chance. On your feet, please. Pol. Maj. Gen. Khun Pan, I hereby reinstate your official rank and assign you to the operation to suppress the Central Plains bandits. Effective immediately. Thank you, Deputy. You're lucky that the bullet went through your cheek. It didn't hit your brain. But the extensive burns on your body... I'm afraid there's nothing I can do about it. You're drunk again. I shouldn't have run away with you. You're right, Lamduan. You shouldn't have married me either. I miss you, Bai. Can I sit with you? Go ahead. Here. Let me ask you something. Why did you become a bandit? Why not? It's a good life. Lots of money. I give it away to anyone who's in trouble. What I have left I send back to my wife. I don't want to stay with my wife because I can't stand her! She's an old bat. She complains all the time. "You're drunk again, blah blah." And you know, you can't trust the law. Guns are justice, the rest is bullshit. Darn! Let me go! Lamduan! Lamduan. Lamduan. Lamduan! Run! No, Lamduan! Lamduan! Lamduan! Lamduan! Have you ever thought of giving yourself up? Lamduan... Let me be free. Dumb card again, Officer Isra. Your ambition is getting the better of you. If you hadn't agreed Governor Thammarong would never have had the nerve to hit me. I know that eventually you'll be the winner in this game. It's time you came out of the dark, Fai. Enter politics and stop sneaking around like petty thieves. The government has issued death warrants on the Blackshirt Bandits. Think about it. Hey! Someone asked me to deliver this. Tubtim! - Don't come near me! - Tubtim! - No! Explosives! - Tubtim. Tubtim. - Bai! - Butr! Hello. You two are fast. Who the hell are you? Show yourself, coward! What do you want? Bandit Bai, you should thank me. I've arranged this confessional meeting for you. What the hell are you talking about? Khun Pan, feel like talking? Tell him who you are. Will you tell him or not? Tubtim! One... Two... I'm a policeman. - Tubtim. - Bai! - Bai! - Tubtim. - No! - Tubtim, run! Don't come in. Bai! Don't! Tubtim! Tubtim! - Get out of here, Bai! - Tubtim! - No, Bai. - Tubtim! - Tubtim! - No! No! Had the bullet hit me instead of him, would you be sad? Of course. In my life... I made a big mistake once. Tubtim! Please don't die! Tubtim! Tubtim! We'll settle this after her funeral. If you're enough of a man. I know you'll be the winner in this game eventually. It's time you came out of the dark, Fai. What do I have to lose? You will be arrested. If you die, your ideology dies with you. But if you still want to fix this country this is the price you have to pay. You and I both know this. Now what you have to do is help me shut down all the Central Plains gangs. Including yours. Then I'll testify that you've been working as our informer. Deal? Cheers. The magic bullet can go right through your protective spell. Only when you can see me. Bai! Bia! The cops! They know all our names. The Blackshirts have been killed one after another. Sir, there's a gunfight. Fai, you've betrayed us! I'm sorry, Bai. I have no choice. Mister... Mister... Slowly. To steal someone's black magic remove his tattooed skin and stitch it on yours. To destroy someone's spell, cover his head with a woman's skirt. Why did you help me? Conscience. This time, too? I'll take you in alive if you give yourself up and testify in favour of the police. I can't promise... I'll turn myself in. But if you want me to talk... I'm ready. What do you know? Deputy Padet... is the mastermind behind the Blackshirt racket. Tiger Fai is his key player. They ordered us to steal all opium from the government's warehouses and resold it to the market at twice the price. He bribed a group of police clerks to cook the books. One day, an innocent clerk found out about the scheme. Roj. The amount of confiscated opium doesn't match the amount being destroyed. Let me take a look. Nothing to worry. This is an outdated file. So the deputy ordered Fai to send hit men to kill them. But the men he sent were drunk. Instead of taking out a few clerks, they massacred the whole precinct. Deputy Padet is pressured to end the Blackshirt gambit. I should've guessed it. When Fai sent us to kill Governor Thammarong... it's only for his own political aspiration. Where's the opium now? Busara! Busara. I'm here to pick up a package. Where are you? You're in the house of pleasure, enjoy yourself first. You go first, I'll wait here. Come here, handsome. Run. So this is who you are. Officer. Now you know me, but I still don't know anything about you. I'm one of the Blackshirts, the criminals you're pursuing. My name is in that book. It's just that the role I've been given is different from those tigers. Why did you become a criminal? Survival, I guess. I could run to the end of the world. But as long as our names are in that book Deputy Padet will come after me and everyone you see here now. This opium is the only evidence you can use to incriminate him. I'm sure he's sending his men to steal it... and to kill us all. We will help you guard this evidence... if you promise to treat us as witnesses in the trial and let us go back to live a normal life. Look out! Joi! Joi! Joi! What happened, Joi? - How're you doing? - My leg... What... What the hell are you doing? Stop! - Joi, hurry up! - Joi, shoot him! - Stop! - Quickly! - Shoot him! - Hurry up! - Joi! - Shoot! Joi! Hurry up! Get down! Asawin! Let the sacred water be our witness. We share gold. Anyone who's drunk this sacred water and later betrays his brothers may he die by the sword. May bullets and storms take his life. Even in his death may he burn in hell and never be reborn. Relinquish the black magic, so you can die without suffering. Tiger Bai, Tiger Fai, Tiger Butr. Brothers forever! Forever! Allow me. By the power of great masters I am wearing these talismans on my skin. The 84,000 verses of the scriptures are now a part of me. Think you're so clever? Paying bandits to get rid of bandits. You think the Blackshirts will kill one another? Search! Where's the opium? Khun Pan... I want him dead. Where the hell is he? Run! Everyone! Run! Shall we arrest them? Arrest your butt! Haven't you seen? You want to get killed too? Let's run! Now! Let's go! Bai, you're under arrest. Move. Papers. Captain, they're all the Blackshirt. There are many things that can't be beaten with supernatural power. After arresting Tiger Bai, I gathered all the evidences that could bring Deputy Padet to justice. You ordered Fai to rob the opium then you doctored the books. You know it belongs to me, how did you dare touch it? Because I'm a police officer. Anyway, thanks for delivering the evidence. This will back up the report I've sent to Headquarters that Isra is the mastermind. The deputy... dumped it all on Isra. His signature in the opium accounts sealed his fate. Deputy Padet walked free. Let me go! You can't do this! Padet, you weasel. Try harder next time. Power always gives you more options. But the consequences depend on which one you'll choose. I know that eventually you'll be the winner in this game. Some choose the path where they'll become somebody. Hey, Bai. Are you dead or what? Others choose the path where they'll disappear forever. Tiger Bai has escaped! Find him! He's escaped! In this country, you can pay your way through everything. You can even avoid jail if you have enough money. It's a fact, I can't convince anyone otherwise. I just hope that sometimes luck will be on the right side. You've cleared his name, he died an innocent man. That's more than he could ever ask for. I did my best. He told me to bury all his belongings in his grave. Excuse me, sir. And I just hope that one day I'll find the answer that validates my belief and what I'm fighting for. Provincial Police Region One "The only true faith is our faith in virtue." The motivation to make this film... I was inspired by the image of Khun Pan lighting a candle from King Rama IX. It looks like he received a royal blessing and an inspiration to do good for the country. Thai people must keep that candle flame shining.
