Oh, you remember? -You and I danced to this song -[breathing heavily] at cousin Sadie's wedding. And you were 18... and I was 35. And everybody there kept saying how... how we look, just like brother and sister. Do you remember? Yes I remember. I remember how you held me.

Oh sure, I tell everybody it's... good for your mental health. -[laughs] That's good. -[giggles] That's a good slogan. I'm going to keep that.

What can you tell me about a guy named Felipe Soto? Felipe? -Felipe S... Sota? -Soto. Now who is he, huh? [Fred] Well I'm not too sure. So what do you wanna know? Well, there were these three guys, um... there's this Kernel from Central America. -what's his name? Um... -You mean Castillo? Yeah! And his bodyguard and there's this big tall blonde American. -From Immigration. -Not from Immigration. He's uh... CIA. -The CIA? -Mm-hmm. Jesus Christ, it's what I was afraid of. [both speak together] There's an election in two weeks, yeah. For God sakes, I'm the Sherriff here you know -I could be accused of uh... -Nothing. [Helena] What has he got to do with you? Well they showed me a wedding photograph, right. And the guys wife is the girl working down at the diner. -Amy? -Amy. -Yeah. -Think it's Amy? Now I've been told Felipe is dead, right? But these guys obviously think he's very much alive, -and they want him for murder. -[laughs] Well it can't be Amy, you know, Amy was married to an American. His name was, uh... Frances Sutton. Yes, I don't know of allot about her, you know. It's friends of the family but... anyhow, Frances Sutton, he died in a car accident and... and um, Amy and the baby survived. so um... [chuckles] I wouldn't worry about it. Really. [laughs] You should go to the supermarket and have your picture taken. -Kissing some babies. [laughs] -[laughing] I wouldn't worry too much about it. -Alright. -Okay, keep it going, ja. -You look good. -Thank you. [dramatic music] Jerry! Got to get him out of here, Castillo is here. Pack his things, put that in. It's from the pharmacy. -Right, straight away! -Thanks. Said that he'd fight him, shit! [Jerry] Come on, get up! Gotta get you out of here, right now! Let's go. Martin, I'm bringing Felipe to L.A. Kernel Castillo is here. It's just a question of... time, minutes. [huffs] Um... no I haven't spoken to her, but-- They know about her... yes. Um... I'll be in L.A in about an hour and half. So would you try figure something out. Right, bye-bye. We'd like a few moments of your time. As you know I'm a doctor and I have an appointment -and I have to leave. -This won't take long. I don't think you understand what I'm saying. I'm a doctor and I have an ap-- Please sit down Dr. Lindenheim. [Jerry] Easy on the steps, let me help. Things bleeding again. We can stop at Dr. Robinson's on the way and tell him to have a look at that, huh? Okay. [Jerry] Alright now. Wait here, and I'm going to go in and find out who's in there with Helena, alright. Amy, forgive her. It's just talk. It was me. I was a drunk from the time I was 15. We were on our way back from some party. As usual I drank too much. And we went down an embankment. I ended up with a few scratches. She got stuck in that wheelchair. [whispers] Joe. I've been a member of AA for 10 years now. What else can I do? She still blames me. But I want to live. I want to be alive. She can't... but we can! Joe, it can't work. She won't let me stay and [sighs] it couldn't work between us anyways. [whispers] I'm so sorry, Joe. I'm so sorry, Joe. I have to speak to Dr. Lindenheim. She's waiting for some information-- it's important! Wait! Kernel. [sighs] Yes? I have to speak to Dr. Lindenheim. It's rather urgent. She's very busy. [laughs] It will only be a minute. Just one. Impossible. Why don't you wait in there. [laughs] Well um... actually... I have some... things that I need to take care of outside. The Dr. Lindenheim would prefer if you waited in there. [ominous music] [gunshots] [thud] [more gunshots] [gunshot] [ominous music continues] [footsteps] [thud] [huffs] But this is the third time I've called. You tell him, I pay him plenty for his services, Conchita. I am not going to wait for him to call me back. This is an emergency! [speaking Spanish] Mrs. Moore has called three times. She says it's an emergency. What else is new? [chuckles] -[child] Not again. -[Conchita laughs] Oh Dr. Robinson [pants] I'm in terrible pain. Joe threw me clear across the restaurant. I need a shot. [panting] Please? [sighs] Thanks Tom. [slow Spanish music] Well I told you you're not going to find anything. -You're a liar-- -You're wasting your time-- Dr. Lindenheim. Our governments are friendly Your country gives us economic aid, military aid... In Washington we were told we would get the fullest... cooperation. Really? Did you tell them that you were going to break into my office pull a gun at me, and ransack my place? Turn everything upside down, I mean, really! You should, you should produce a search warrant, in a perfectly orderly fashion, just like everybody else. Who the-- who the hell do you think you are? [Castillo] Things like that take time. The man we are looking for is dangerous. He's accused of murder. [Helena] Yeah, you make me laugh. I mean it's really, amusing I mean, in your country murder is the official policy of the government. [laughs] Thousands of people are being murdered every day. [Helena] Yes, your highest religious leader was assassinated in his own cathedral-- Be careful Dr. Lindenheim. Your political sympathies are well documented. Don't, Don't. Don't threaten me Carl. Cause it doesn't work on me. It's a complete waste of time. You know, I live in a democracy, cause hundr-- [gasps then moans] [slow Spanish music] -How do you do? -What, what do you want? Please, I'm looking for my wife. She works at a cantina near here. Do you know the name of the place? No. Shall I call a doctor? It's okay, but could I possibly rest here for a moment? Thank you very much. [sighs] Is this what you're looking for? Yes. [Joe sighs] So you ready to go? Almost. I packed the baby's stuff, I just have to pack mine. I'll come with you. Oh Joe, you can't. You don't understand. You don't know. No, I'll come with you. [sighs] Joe, it wouldn't be right. Right? It's not a word. Alone! Now that's a word. You're not alone Joe, you have your mother. -She needs you. -She needs pills. And a miserable day, after day, stretching nowhere. Well I can't do it anymore. I tell you Amy, when I stand close to you, I come alive. You have one life inside yourself, and you deserve all the years it has. Not to be lost, lousy, wasted years, don't you believe that? Yes, I do believe that. But you don't know who I am. [Amy gasps] I love you. Joe. It isn't that. Well it's not anything. It's not that. Joe, it can't be between us! Don't leave me. Joe, listen to me. It can't be! Amy... I'm begging you. -Don't leave me. -Joe please stop, Joe! Listen to me! I can't! Amy! [crying] My name is Joe, and I'm an alcoholic. My name is Joe, and I'm an alcoholic. My name is Joe, and I'm an alcoholic. You bet I am. [sighs] [car honks] -Hey Doc. -Hi Fred. Hey kids, how are ya? [Fred] How you doing today? Good to see ya. You not going to get many votes around here. Well actually Doc I came to see Connie-- Conchita. In broad daylight? My-my. She's inside. Thank you Doc. [Conchita gasps] [Fred moans] -Fred. [giggles] -Conchita. -[both giggle] -Not here, huh. -How about some fleabag motel -[laughs] -in Los Angeles, huh? -[gasps] -What are you doing here? -What am I doing here? [inhales] Well, uh... you know that girl who works down at Joe's café? -Amy? The one with the baby. -Yeah, yeah. What's she like? Well, she is very nice. Very sweet, but she seems a little troubled. Yeah? She ever talk about her husband? No, he's dead isn't he? Yeah, I mean, she ever tell you what he did, or how he died? Anything? Well no, there was never reason to. -What's wrong? -I don't know, I don't know. What do you think her nationality is? Nationality? I don't know. I've never thought about it. Alright. [Fred] I gotta go. Listen um... I got to do this rally at the high school tonight. I was wondering... if you'd like to come with me? I love you. Are you sure you don't want me to send for the doctor? No... no I'm okay now. Thank you very much for your kindness. I must find my wife. Here, take my cane! -No, I couldn't do this. -I have many. I... I make them myself. [in Spanish] Thank you very much, granny. [in Spanish] Good bye. There's a café a couple miles down the road. Maybe that's where she is. God bless you.

Look, I can buy that. -I can buy that alright. -Joe. [coins falling] -I can't buy what you-- -You don't know who I am. -Come here. Hey, hey. -[groans] Now you tell me who you are! You tell me who the-- My name isn't Amy, it's Maria! My husband is Felipe Soto, I'm still married! He was leading his people in our position to their government they arrested him and tortured him and we escaped! And we told everybody he was dead and they didn't believe us and now they after him, and they want to kill him. And I couldn't tell you that then.

They looking for him. -They say he's married to Amy. -Amy? Yeah, they also said he's wanted for murder. But Dr. Lindenheim said Amy's husband is an American, and that he's dead. Now what is that? Well, why are you so concerned? I'm the Sherriff goddamn it, that's why I'm concerned. I've got an election in two weeks. That's why I'm concerned!

Why can't these people wait till after the election, huh? I mean, then they can all go crazy! [Fred sighs] I'm sorry. [Doctor] Joe, I really should be getting back. I'm not ready to go back yet, Doc. It will all be there when I get back. Except the one thing I really care about. So another minute, another day what difference does it make, huh? [Doctor] I have things to do, Joe. Things. [Abe] Hey Doc. Why don't you have a drink? Come on. Sit down. Sit down a minute, relax. [Doctor] Maybe I will. [Abe groans] It's about time you got here, Fred. I could've died. Jesus, when Joe falls off the wagon, he doesn't kid around, does he? Did you find him yet? No, not yet. But don't worry um... Rick put out a A.P.B with highway patrol. They'll pick him up. What the hell is this? Blood? Where'd it come from? You wouldn't believe me if I told you. Fred... I want to press charges against Joe. You what? Now you listen to me. You don't want to press charges against your boy? That's your flesh and blood. So what do you say I go find him, talk to him... and then I bring him back here, alright? Maybe you're right. Besides how the hell am I going to run this place alone, huh? [laughs] That's a good point. Besides, I have a pretty good idea where he is. [baby gurgling] So where you headed? Well I tried calling Dr. Lindenheim, but I didn't get an answer. So, I guess... I'll just go over there, and wait. I tell you what. I've gotta go out to the lake and pick up Joe. That's the opposite direction, but uh... I'll call my partner and have him come pick you two up. No, no, no, no. I can wait for the bus. Really it's not a problem. Really? You wait here. Alright? Oh, do you mind stopping at Dr. Robinson's first? I'd like to leave the baby there. [Rick] No problem. Doctor... Lindenheim. It's me. Our patience... is wearing very thin. Where... is Felipe? You're being very... very foolish! [Carl] Frances Sutton. Frances Sutton, Felipe Soto, Frances Sutton. That's not very smart, Doctor. [sighs] Wife, Amy. That's the name of the girl at the diner. What day is today, Kernel? The twenty fifth. Well then just yesterday Señor Sutton, had a complete physical at the offices of Dr. Robinson. [Carl] Is he still there? Kernel, you and Bruno, drop in on the doctor and see if our friend is still there. I'll wait here. Why are you doing this? [sighs] When I was um... when I was ten years old, I... I saw something that um. [sighs] affirmed something in me. I have never forgotten. Thank God. I was in a concentration camp. And um... there was a group of women, they were... going into a gas chamber. They were, naked and um... one of them, was a dancer. Very beautiful. Beautiful body, long black hair. One of the SS guards. Maybe he had been intimate with her, I don't know. He um... said um... [speaks German] [chuckles] Dance for me. [chuckles] Very dramatic. And she did. She got closer and closer and... this black hair sort of embracing him, right. [laughs] He forgot all about that he wanted to kill her. And he didn't notice that she took his gun, right. And she shot him. Of course the next moment, she was... Shot down by the other guards but... didn't matter, see. Cause she lived! And died. [chuckles] On her own terms. [gun cocks] [gunshot] [Amy] Okay, Jerry will help me get the rest of the stuff in-- -Thanks Amy. -Thank you. -See ya. -[Rick] See ya. [suspense music] [car engine starts] Felipe? -[Amy screams] -Where is he? -Keep going. -[screams] -Is he in this one here, huh? -[screams] -Is he in here? -[screams] No! [Amy] Felipe! Felipe! [Amy screams] Felipe! Felipe! -Helena! Helena! -Where the fuck is he? [Joe] We not buying any, Fred. [Fred] You alright there, Joe? You feeling okay? Never better. -Hey Doc. -[Doctor mumbles] You always saying you need time off. Good to see you out here relaxing. I'm not sure this is what I had in mind. Mrs. Moore called me and said that uh... Joe had cut his finger off. I was wondering if that was just another one of her stories? No Fred. That isn't just one of her stories. Jesus Christ, you actually cut off your finger. What the hell's the matter with you? Why? Well I'm not sure now. But I'm sure I'm going to have one hell of a hangover tomorrow. [sighs] And I'm sure I'm going to go back to that diner, pack my things and leave. Where you going to go? Where you headed? Sacramento. Sounds good. Think I might even stop off and have a chat with the Governor. I think we should be getting back now, Joe. [sighs] He's got me beat anyway. We've got them coat hangers to deliver. Don't want to keep them dresses waiting. [Fred] You boys mind if I tag along? Son of a bitch.[laughs] Señora. Who are you? Please, forgive me. But I have come, I'm looking for Maria? Maria? There's nobody here by that name. Do you mind if I sit? For a moment. I'm very tired. [car horn] Thank you. [sighs] Señora? Forgive me. I didn't recognize you. [laughs] I see they've wounded you too. So many of us, killed. Or wounded. [Felipe sighs] Cantina since changed. So much time. I used to come back here with Maria, it was before the baby. We used to come with our friends. And we danced! And sang, and laughed. And tears too. So very long ago. You say the baby and Maria are not here? Sorry. [sighs] Me too. Don't leave without me, okay? Alright, I'll wait. But don't be too long. I'm already way behind schedule. Joe. Joe! Before you go anywhere, you'd better stop by the office and let me fix that hand right. You won't like it if you get blood poisoning. I know a better doctor in Sacramento. I'll be at the house if you want-- [Fred] Joe! I don't want any more trouble out of you today. You understand? I got to go back to the station. Now you behave yourself. I mean it. Joe! There's a crazy man inside. He should feel right at home. What does he want? He's looking for some woman, named Maria. And a baby. He's Amy's husband. [Sonny] I thought her husband was dead? [inhales] Hey. Can I help you? I remember you. You're an American reporter with a kind face. I remember you wanted a story you wanted me to tell you and there was no time. You will listen now? [Joe] Yeah, sure. Let me get you something to drink. -Something cold? -Oh very nice. Water please. -[Joe] Okay. -Just water. Okay. - Sí. -Gracias. Alright Amígo. Uh... hey, you better get Dr. Robinson this man's in pain. [speaking Spanish] [phone rings] -[baby crying] -Good afternoon doctor's office. Ah, Mrs. Moore. I'm sorry Dr, Robinson isn't here right now, but if-- [ominous music] Well he's been out for quite a while. He has lots of appointments for the rest of the day. Wait a minute, I don't understand. Her husband? Amy's husband is at the diner? Well did you call Dr. Lindenheim? [door slams] [baby crying continues] Okay, okay. The minute he gets here. Bye-bye. Where'd they go. [baby screaming] [phone ringing] I was a teacher. At a catholic university. Then my sweet children, my students. [inhales] [laughs] They demanded democracy. -Freedom. -[people chanting] And the Government shut them down. So, I had to join them in the streets. [people screaming] [gun shots] Thou shalt not kill. I said. I told them, there must be an end to war. An end to the tearing of the flesh. I pleaded with them, no weapons. No war! And they cast... blows... upon my body. And they bruised my flesh. And the authorities were there. Meaning the greed of their sins. [Abe] Hey Joe, I got to be going! I knew then only the word... only the Spirit of Christ. Thou shalt not kill. And they threw me out of the university for... political activities, they said. Following the teachings of Christ. [sighs] Not much has changed in 2000 years, huh? [Joe] Felipe, would you like to lie down? No, little brother. Very soon I will sleep for all eternity. I fear I'm half asleep already. Just listen! Please! Now! Because it was then that I met Maria. [inhales] She was born in America. Louisiana, she told me. When she finished college... her parents were homesick for their homeland... returned to our country. Maria was visiting them, when the demonstration started. Maria stayed at my side. During all my troubles at the university. But when finally there was no hope in continuing my work... we joined my people in the hills. To help fight... destroyers of our country. We went from village to village asking people to join us. Against the oppressors. The killers of our children. And then I was captured. They threw me in a room, and asked me a thousand questions. People's names and places. [speaking Spanish] [continues speaking in Spanish] I couldn't tell them a thing. But if only. They had beat me more, killed me. If only they had hit me more with stones on my bruised flesh. If only, if only, if only they had left me whole. [screaming] But the rest, for me is like a dream. Escape! In an airplane. Hospital, and American doctor. You will tell our story! Thank you. I think maybe I'll rest now. [acoustic guitar music] [gunshots firing] [screams] [Castillo laughing] Well good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Ah, the good Professor! [laughs] Goodbye Señor. [gunshots firing] [screams] [groans] [yells] [gunshots] -[Fred] You alright? -[Joe] Yeah. -Jesus Christ. -Where's Amy? I took her to Dr. Lindenheim's house. [Joe] Okay, that's where I'm going! No you're going nowhere. -No, I'm going-- -Now you listen to me. You are going nowhere! You understand? Now this is just two of them. There's still the American. Let's go Rick. Stay here! -[panting] Anything? -Nothing. [Carl] Drop your gun Sherriff! I said drop your gun, and tell your flunky downstairs to drop his too! That is if you want to see the young lady live? I didn't know Immigration Officers were in the habit of going around killing people. Let's end all conversation, Sherriff. You hand over Mr. Soto, and I'll let you have Mrs. Soto. Sherriff, I told you to tell your friend to get lost. No, you stay right where you are, Rick. -I'm asking one last time. -Fuck you! -Fuck you! -[Amy yelps] Lay your gun down. I tell you what, first, you give me the lady, alright. You give me the husband, I'll give you the lady. [Amy panting and whimpers] -[Amy yelps] -Alright, alright. -No! Don't tell him where he is. -Shut up! He's at the diner with the rest of your goddamn friends. [Amy] Oh God! Now, Mrs. Soto is an American citizen, you understand? I suggest you release her to me, right now! -Drop your gun, Sherriff. -[whimpers] When I get to the door, with both your guns. You can have the lady. For the last time, drop your gun. Don't you hurt her! Alright. [Amy whimpers] [whimpering] [thud] Okay. [Carl softly] Now kick it over here. -What? [louder] Now kick it over here! [Carl] Back up! Now tell your friend to drop his gun. Throw it away, Rick. Come on, Fred you kn-- Goddamn it, you do what I tell you! [thud] [Carl] Up the stairs! -Move! -[Fred] Come on Rick. [Carl] Back up! Move, move, move! [Amy groans] [squeals and moans] [both groaning] [huffing and groaning] [moaning] Good try. [huffing] You knew I wasn't going to leave anyone of you alive. [gunshots] [dramatic music] [dramatic music continues] [Doctor] Hey. I was hoping I could see Joe, before I left. Well... he has his hands full, you know, Getting Sonny set up with her sister in San Diego. Getting the café sold. Yeah, I know. I spoke to him allot over the phone. -Hey guys. -Hi! I'm uh, sorry I'm late. Too many reporters, and uh, too much champagne. Congratulations! Saw you on the tube last night. -Wow! -[Doctor] Pretty good speech. -Yeah, you think so? -It was great! Listen, you really didn't have to come all this way to pick me up, I could have taken a taxi to the airport. Well I want the folks in your country to know that uh, most Americans are pretty friendly and hospitable people. Am I right, Conchita? -Uh huh. -[laughs] -[Fred clears his throat] -Well, thanks for everything. [Amy] Um, listen... listen um... If you see Joe, could you please tell him that I'm r-- Maria! Joe! I'm really glad you made it out here to say goodbye. Goodbye? [huffs] What do you mean goodbye? You, the baby and me, we're all going. I got my ticket and the passport. -[gasps] -I want to be there for you Amy. Maria. There's a war going on down there, Joe. I know. Felipe told me. Well, you wanted tree lined streets, you wanted.. quiet! You wanted peace. We'll make peace there! [romantic music] [birds chirping] [Fred] You know you guys keep this up, you going to miss you plane. Let's go. I got a big backseat. You can hug all you want. [Fred] Let's go! -Oh, thank you Conchita. -She's ready for her mamma. -[Connie in Spanish] Good luck. -[in Spanish] Thanks a million. [Connie] Bye Joe. [engine starts] Bye Joe, bye Amy. [ending music]
