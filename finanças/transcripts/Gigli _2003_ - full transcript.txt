WHAT THE FUCK IS YOUR PROBLEM, BITCH? â™ª HEAR THE DEMAGOGUE, FUNKY DEMAGOGUE â™ª "BITCH"? YOU KNOW WHAT, CREATING A SCENE RIGHT NOW WOULD BE A BAD THING. â™ª CHECK A LOOK-ALIKE, WANNA SEE A JOKE â™ª YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT. WHY DON'T YOU COME OVER HERE, SO WE CAN KICK YOUR ASS. (boy #1) WHAT HAPPENED? LET ME. OK? â™ª STYLES NOT REALLY MATCHED UP â™ª GO AHEAD. â™ª PUSHED 'N DRESSED UP â™ª YOU KNOW, WHAT YOU BOYS NEED IS TO DEVELOP BETTER PEOPLE SKILLS. HOWEVER, IN THE MEANTIME... â™ª CALLED NEW YORK â™ª â™ª YOU GOT BEEF â™ª EXCUSE ME. â™ª FOUL LIKE A PIG ON A BUM â™ª ( turns off music ) YOU EVER HEARD OF TAI MOI CHAI? NO. OK. IN TRADITIONAL TAI MOI CHAI, THERE ARE 5 LEVELS OF DIGITAL ORB EXTRUSION. THAT'S THE GOUGING OUT OF YOUR OPPONENT'S EYEBALL WITH ONE'S FINGER. NOW, THE HIGHEST AND MOST DIFFICULT TO MASTER IS MY PERSONAL FAVORITE: KAI TOI MAI. LOOSELY TRANSLATED, THAT'S "THE RIP THAT TAKES THE PAST." NOW, ONCE THE THUMB LIQUEFIES THE EYE, IT IS DEFTLY AND IMMEDIATELY REPLACED BY THE FOREFINGER. DEEP THRUST, HOOKING AROUND AND SECURING THE OCULAR NERVE AND THEN REMOVING IT WITH SUCH FORCE AS TO BRING WITH IT, BY SUCTION, A VITAL PORTION OF THE VISUAL CORTEX. THE PART OF THE BRAIN, AS I'M SURE YOU MAY KNOW, THAT STORES VISUAL MEMORY. NOW, THE EXTRAORDINARY ELEMENT OF THIS MOVE, THE GENIUS OF IT, THE--THE--THE ABSOLUTE POETRY OF IT IS THAT, ASIDE FROM THE OBVIOUS WOUND, ONE'S OPPONENT IS LEFT WITH NO MEMORY OF ANYTHING HE HAS EVER SEEN. FAMILY, FRIENDS, NOTHING. HENCE, KAI TOI MAI: "THE RIP THAT TAKES THE PAST." AS YOU CAN IMAGINE, VERY DIFFICULT TO PRACTICE HERE IN THE UNITED STATES BUT, I FELT, WELL WORTH THE TRIPS TO THE CHANG RAI PROVINCE. PEOPLE SKILLS. SEE, KNOWING HOW TO PROPERLY JUDGE CHARACTER, KNOWING HOW AND WHEN TO MAKE A MOVE, IN SHORT, KNOWING WHO TO AND WHO NOT TO FUCK WITH. THESE ARE THINGS YOU BOYS ARE GONNA WANNA WORK ON IN THE FUTURE. OK? OH, AND ONE MORE THING: SPORTS ARE ALL WELL AND GOOD, BUT VERY HARD TO EARN A LIVING AT. SO I WANT YOU GUYS TO STUDY HARD, AND KEEP YOUR GRADES UP, ALL RIGHT? OK? EVERYONE, YES? (all) YES. OK. GOOD. BRIAN, LET'S GO. NICE COMPUTER. HEY, SO CAN YOU REALLY DO ALL THAT KUNG FU SHIT YOU SAID BACK THERE WITH THE--THE EYE AND THAT? NO. THAT WAS ALL BULLSHIT, HUH? YEP. SUN TZU SAID THAT, IN A WAR, THE BEST VICTORY IS THAT WHICH REQUIRES NO BATTLE. IS THIS SOME MORE BULLSHIT NOW I'M GETTIN'? - NO. - WHO'S SUN TZU? A CHINESE MILITARY THEORETICIAN WHO POINTED OUT THAT IN A CONFLICT, GETTING ANGRY, WHICH YOU SEEM TO DO A LOT OF, IS A TACTICALLY AND STRATEGICALLY STUPID MOVE. IT CLOUDS YOUR ABILITY TO REASON. IT GIVES YOUR ADVERSARY THE UPPER HAND. YOU WANNA CLOUD YOUR ADVERSARY'S ABILITY TO REASON, THUS GAINING THE UPPER HAND YOURSELF. WHATEVER. YOU KNOW WHAT? GIVEN HOW UNHAPPY YOU SEEM TO BE, I CAN SEE HOW THAT WOULDN'T BE THE EASIEST THING FOR YOU TO DO. WHAT IS THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN? JUST THAT. I MEAN, WHEN MEN ARE LITTLE BOYS, THEY'RE--THEY'RE ENCOURAGED NOT TO CRY, NOT TO SHOW THEIR SADNESS, SO THEY'RE FORCED TO FIND OTHER WAYS TO LET THOSE FEELINGS OUT. AND AS I'M SURE YOU KNOW, FIGHTING AND GETTING ANGRY ARE MUCH MORE ACCEPTABLE MALE BEHAVIORS. SO WHEN THESE LITTLE BOYS GROW UP, GUESS WHAT OUTLET THEY USE TO EXPRESS THEIR SADNESS. A GUY WHO'S MISERABLE AT WORK OR DEPRESSED ABOUT HIS LIFE COMES HOME AT THE END OF THE DAY, WHAT DOES HE DO? HE DOESN'T USUALLY CRY IN FRONT OF THE WIFE AND KIDS. HE USUALLY YELLS AT THEM. SO, LARRY... WHAT? WHAT IS IT EXACTLY YOU'RE SO SAD ABOUT? [snickers] NO, I'M SERIOUS. [phone ringing] YO. YEAH. WHAT ABOUT YOUR FRIEND? MRS. LEONARD. WHATEVER HER NAME IS. LOOK, I CAN'T RIGHT NOW, I'M SORRY. IT'S NOT A GOOD TIME. IT'S NOT A GOOD TIME, MA, THAT'S WHY. NO. OK, OK. ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT! OK, WHAT DO YOU WANT, BLOOD? I SAID OK. I'M COMIN' OVER, ALL RIGHT? I'LL BE RIGHT OVER THERE. I GOT TO, UH, MAKE A QUICK DETOUR. YOU CAN STAY IN THE CAR. (mother) OH, EASY. A LITTLE LOWER. (Larry) RIGHT HERE? A LITTLE BIT HIGHER. A LITTLE LOWER. - - MA. A LITTLE LOWER! ALL RIGHT, RIGHT-- OHH, GOD. LOOK, MA, IF MRS. LEONARD ISN'T AROUND, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO CALL A DOCTOR SOMETIMES. I CAN'T JUST DROP EVERYTHING AND SHOW UP HERE ALL THE TIME, OK? WHAT, AND I DIDN'T DROP EVERYTHING FOR YOU? "OH, I'M SO SORRY, LARRY, "I CAN'T CHANGE YOUR DIAPER NOW. YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO CALL MRS. LEONARD." [knocking on door] - LET ME JUST-- - LET ME. HOLD ON. WHAT? HE'S GOT TO PEE. I GOT TO PEE, LARRY. I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU TO WAIT IN THE CAR. I THOUGHT YOU'D PREFER IT IF WE CAME IN RATHER THAN TAKE THE CAR SOMEWHERE. WOULDN'T WANT YOU TO THINK WE LAMMED OUT ON YOU. BESIDES, I WANT TO MEET YOUR MOTHER. [scoffing] NO. (mother) LARRY, ARE THOSE FRIENDS OF YOURS? YEAH, CLOSE PERSONAL. - WELL, INVITE THEM IN. - I GOT TO PEE, LARRY. - LARRY, INVITE THEM IN! I AM, MA, ALL RIGHT? (mother) WELL, [chuckling] HELLO, EVERYBODY. HELLO. MY GOD. WHAT A BEAUTY. MA. WHAT? I'M JUST SAYIN'. YOU SHOULD SEE SOME OF THE PIGS HE'S BROUGHT BY. I MEAN, NOT THAT THEY WERE PIGS, PER SE. IT'S JUST THAT, BY AND LARGE, THEY WERE WHAT I WOULD CALL INSIGNIFICANT WOMEN. YOU, I COULD TELL RIGHT OFF THE BAT, YOU SEEM TO BE OF SOME SUBSTANCE. EXCUSE ME, MISS, WHERE'S THE MEN'S ROOM? OH, RIGHT THIS WAY, DARLIN'. LARRY, SHE'S GORGEOUS. DON'T YOU FUCK THIS ONE UP. (mother) SO, WHAT IS YOUR STORY, HONEY? (Brian) I'M LARRY'S FRIEND. DON'T, DON'T PAY NO ATTENTION TO HER. SHE THINKS I'M BEAUTIFUL. YEAH. SHE'S BLIND IN ONE EYE, THOUGH. OPEN THE DOOR. YOU ALL RIGHT IN THERE? SO THIS IS WHERE YOU GREW UP? ARE YOU WRITIN' A BOOK? - [sighing] - MA. OH, SHUT UP. I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING. I THINK YOU TWO MAKE A VERY CUTE COUPLE, THOUGH. - MA. - WHAT? WHAT'S WITH THE "MA, MA, MA, MA, MA"? STOP ALREADY WITH THE "MA." SO, TELL ME, - ARE YOU AND LARRY SWEETHEARTS? - MA! BEFORE YOU ANSWER, LET ME SAY UP FRONT THAT I HOPE SO. WHAT? YES, I HOPE SO. WHAT'S SO TERRIBLE ABOUT "I HOPE SO"? YEAH? GUESS WHAT. WHAT? SHE'S A LESBIAN. NEVER MIND. SHE'S BEEN WITH FELLAS BEFORE. AM I RIGHT, DARLIN'? HUH? (Ricki) YOU'RE RIGHT. BUT SOMETIMES THEY HAVE THEIR LIMITATIONS. AM I RIGHT? YEAH. [both laughing] WHAT ARE YOU TWO TALKIN' ABOUT? OH, NEVER MIND. WE KNOW WHAT WE'RE TALKIN' ABOUT. AM I RIGHT, SWEETHEART? YOU'RE RIGHT. YOU KNOW, I WASN'T ALWAYS JUST LARRY'S MOTHER. MMM, I USED TO BE QUITE EXPERIMENTAL. - OH, JESUS CHRIST! - LOOK AT HIM! LOOK WHO'S NOT UP-TO-THE-MINUTE NOW. - BIG BOY. - THAT'S IT. WE'RE GOIN'. BRIAN, COME ON. WE'RE GOIN'. THAT'S IT. MA, WHAT THE... ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT. JUST REMEMBER, YOU TWO, LIFE'S NOT JUST BLACK-AND-WHITE. ALL RIGHT, MA, WE'LL REMEMBER THAT. BRIAN, LET'S GO. WE'RE GOIN' NOW. WE'RE GOIN'. LET'S GO. COME HERE, YOU BIG LUG, GIVE ME A KISS. - I LOVE YOU. - YEAH. - I WASHED MY HANDS, LARRY. - CONGRATULATIONS. LET'S GO. - GOODBYE. - COME HERE, DARLIN'. [sighing] I FEEL LIKE I KNOW YOU ALREADY. - VERY NICE MEETING YOU. - IT'S MY PLEASURE. ALL RIGHT, WE'RE GOIN'. LET'S GO. COME ON. LET'S GO, BRIAN. JUST REMEMBER, YOU TWO, KEEP AN OPEN MIND BECAUSE YOU NEVER KNOW. - WE WILL. - BYE. - BYE. (Ricki) I LIKE HER, SHE'S VERY NICE. (Larry) OH, MAN. (woman on phone) ON THE SATELLITE MAP, THE CLOUD OVER QUEENSLAND AND NEW SOUTH WALES IS BRINGING SHOWERS, AND THERE'S VERY LITTLE ACTIVITY OVER THE REST OF THE CONTINENT. BUT THERE IS SOME LOW-LEVEL CLOUD OVER SOUTHERN VICTORIA WHICH WILL BRING ISOLATED SHOWERS MAINLY TO COASTAL AREAS. ANOTHER CHILLY NIGHT IN MELBOURNE'S OUTER SUBURBS WITH THE MERCURY... HEY. WHAT ARE YOU DOING NOW? ...AND AVALON FALLING AS LOW... BRIAN, I TOLD YOU, THIS IS VERY EXPENSIVE. IT'S NOT EXPENSIVE. DON'T ARGUE WITH ME. WHAT--WHAT ARE-- WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS? WHAT DO YOU CARE ABOUT THE WEATHER IN FUCKING ENGLAND FOR? IT'S IN AUSTRALIA. - WHATEVER. - IT'S NOT ENGLAND. WHATEVER, BRIAN. WHY DO YOU KEEP CALLING THERE? 'CAUSE I REALLY, REALLY LIKE HER VOICE. OK. TRY TO KEEP IT UNDER CONTROL, THOUGH. ALL RIGHT? OK, LARRY, I'LL TRY. THANK YOU. YOU'RE WELCOME. [exhaling] SO I'M NOT YOUR TYPE, HUH? HOW DID WE GET BACK THERE ALL OF A SUDDEN? RELAX. YOU'RE MORE WOMAN THAN I KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH. I DON'T NEED TO BE DIPPIN' INTO THE SISTERHOOD. BUT I'M JUST CURIOUS, BECAUSE ALL OF A SUDDEN NOW YOU SAY YOU'VE BEEN WITH GUYS. I HAVE. BUT THEY HAVE THEIR, UH, SHORTCOMINGS... WELL, BESIDES THE FACT THAT THEY GIVE TERRIBLE HEAD. SEE, RIGHT THERE, THAT TELLS ME SOMETHING. I KNOW THE GUYS YOU'VE BEEN WITH OBVIOUSLY DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO, UH, HOW TO BRING HOME THE PEARLS WHEN THEY WERE DIVING FOR OYSTERS. I WAS ACTUALLY JUST JOKING. EH, WELL, SINCE WE'RE LETTING IT ALL HANG OUT NOW, LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING ELSE. OK, WHEN IT COMES TO PLEASING A WOMAN, YOUR GIRLFRIENDS, THEY'RE JUST... THEY'RE AT A NATURAL DISADVANTAGE. IT'S LIKE THEY MIGHT TRY HARD, BUT THEY'RE JUST NOT BACKED UP WITH MILLIONS OF YEARS OF GENETIC ENGINEERING, PROGRAMMING, INSTINCT. (Larry) NATURE HAS EVOLVED MAN FOR THAT PURPOSE. SATISFY. LEAD THE PACK. THAT'S WHY THESE LESBIANS ARE ALWAYS GOING OUT BUYING, YOU KNOW, SPENDING ALL THEIR DOUGH ON, LIKE, YOU KNOW, SEXUAL APPLIANCES, EROTIC MONKEY WRENCHES AND SHIT, TRYING TO COMPENSATE FOR WHAT THEY DON'T HAVE. WHAT THEY'RE NOT GETTING. THE PENIS. (Larry) THAT'S RIGHT. ITS VERY DESIGN TELLS YOU EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW. FORWARD MOTION. WITH ADVANCEMENTS. FUCKING PROGRESS INTO THE DARK, DEEP, MYSTERIOUS UNKNOWN. IT'S LIKE ADVENTURE-SEEKING, FRONTIER-CONQUERING, OBSTACLE-ERADICATING. WHOA. AND YOU TRIED TO CREATE THE IMPRESSION YOU DIDN'T READ BOOKS. WELL, YOU'RE SETTLING FOR SECOND BEST. THAT'S ALL I'M SAYING. SO, IN REVIEW, YOU'RE SAYING THAT IT'S MEN THAT ARE AT THE TOP OF THE MUST-FUCK PYRAMID? THAT'S ALL I'M TELLING YOU. LOVING, CARING, SENSITIVE, GIVING MEN. - THAT'S RIGHT. [exhaling] WELL, YOU'RE ENTITLED TO YOUR OPINION. BUT LET US RECONSIDER WOMEN FOR A MINUTE. SHALL WE? SURE. THEIR FORM: NECK. SHOULDERS. LEGS. HIPS. I THINK PRETTY COOL. NOW, AS FAR AS YOUR FAMOUS PENIS GOES... THE PENIS IS LIKE SOME SORT OF BIZARRE SEA SLUG OR LIKE A REALLY LONG TOE. I MEAN, IT'S HANDY, IMPORTANT, EVEN. BUT THE PINNACLE OF SEXUAL DESIGN? THE TOP OF THE LIST OF EROTIC DESTINATIONS? I DON'T THINK SO. ONE'S FIRST IMPULSE IS TO KISS WHAT? TO KISS THE LIPS. FIRM, DELICIOUS LIPS. SWEET LIPS. SURROUNDING A WARM, MOIST, DIZZYINGLY SCENTED MOUTH. THAT'S WHAT EVERYONE WANTS TO KISS. NOT A TOE. NOT A SEA SLUG. A MOUTH. NOW, WHY DO YOU THINK THAT IS, STUPID? BECAUSE THE MOUTH IS THE TWIN SISTER, THE ALMOST EXACT LOOK-ALIKE OF THE WHAT? NOT THE TOE. THE MOUTH IS THE TWIN SISTER OF--OF THE VAGINA. AND ALL CREATURES, BIG AND SMALL, SEEK THE ORIFICE. THE OPENING. TO--TO BE TAKEN IN, ENGULFED. TO BE SQUEEZED AND LOVINGLY CRUSHED BY WHAT IS TRULY THE ALL-POWERFUL, ALL-ENCOMPASSING. NOW, IF IT'S DESIGN YOU'RE CONCERNED WITH, HIDDEN MEANINGS, SYMBOLISM AND POWER, WELL, FORGET THE TOP OF MOUNT EVEREST. FORGET THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA, THE MOON, THE STARS. THERE IS NO PLACE, NOWHERE, THAT HAS BEEN THE OBJECT OF MORE AMBITIONS, MORE BATTLES THAN THE SWEET, SACRED MYSTERY BETWEEN A WOMAN'S LEGS THAT I AM PROUD TO CALL MY PUSSY. SO I GUESS THIS IS JUST MY ROUNDABOUT WAY OF SAYING THAT IT IS WOMEN WHO ARE, IN FACT, THE MOST DESIRABLE FORM. [inhales] WOULDN'T YOU AGREE? I AGREE. MMM. AND SO DO I. [breathes deeply] [redial button beeping] (Louis) HELLO? HELLO? HELLO? IS SOMEBODY THERE? YES. WHO'S THIS? WHO IS THIS? WHO'S THIS? [chuckling] WHO IS THIS? I DON'T FIND THIS FUNNY. WHO IS THIS? IS THIS THE RETARD? [chuckling] WHO IS THIS? (Larry) BRIAN, WHAT ARE YOU DOING NOW? GIVE ME THE FUCKING PHONE. HELLO? WHO THE FUCK IS THIS? WHO THE FUCK IS THIS? WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON OVER THERE? NOTHING. SORRY, LOUIS. - WE'RE NOT GETTING THE DESIRED MOVEMENT HERE. WE'RE STEPPING UP THE OPERATION. FIRST THING IN THE MORNING, I WANT YOU TO SEND HIS THUMB TO JAMES DORF... ARE YOU LISTENING TO THIS? - YEAH. - GOOD. TO JAMES DORF AT THE U.S. COURTHOUSE ON SPRING STREET. HOLD ON ONE SECOND. GO--GO IN THE OTHER ROOM. GO IN THE OTHER ROOM IN THE BACK. GO IN THE BACK. I'M TALKING ON THE PHONE. GO IN THE BACK. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? HOW DO I SEND HIS THUMB? YOU CUT IT THE FUCK OFF. YOU TAKE IT TO BOXES 'R' US OR WHATEVER THE FUCK IT IS, YOU PUT THE APPROPRIATE POSTAGE ON IT, AND THAT'S HOW YOU SEND IT. AND SEND IT EXPRESS NEXT-DAY DELIVERY. AND MAKE SURE YOU KINDLY REFRAIN FROM PROVIDING A RETURN ADDRESS, YOU FUCKING DUMMY. I MEAN... YOU WANT ME TO CUT HIS THUMB OFF? OH, IT'S ENOUGH ALREADY. PUT THE CLAM-LICKER ON. HOLD ON. W-W-WAIT A MINUTE. WH-WH-WHAT ABOUT, LIKE, YOU KNOW, THE BLEEDING AND THE-- I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M HAVING THIS CONVERSATION WITH A PROFESSIONAL. YOU WANT I SHOULD SEND PEOPLE THERE TO HELP YOU? THEY'LL TAKE YOUR THUMB, TOO. I'M NOT SAYING THAT. I DO NOT LIKE THE HABIT OF HIRING YOU AND THEN HAVING TO HIRE SOMEONE ELSE TO MAKE SURE YOU DO YOUR JOB RIGHT. - DO YOUR FUCKING JOB RIGHT! - OK. I'M GETTING TIRED OF THIS. [switches off phone] LARRY. WHAT? CAN I STAY HERE WITH YOU? NO. [sighs] TIME FOR YOU TO GO TO BED ANYWAYS. - I DON'T WANNA GO TO BED. - GO TO BED. IF I TELL YOU TO GO TO BED, GO TO BED. I DON'T WANNA GO TO BED, THOUGH. (Larry) "NEW. OUR BEST CHARMIN EVER. "CHARMIN ULTRA DOUBLE ROLL. "TWICE AS MANY SHEETS AS REGULAR CHARMIN ULTRA. UNSCENTED BATHROOM TISSUE. 170 SQUARE FEET." BLAH, BLAH, BLAH. "4.5 INCHES BY 4.0 INCHES." AND THEY GOT IT IN CENTIMETERS OR WHATEVER. IT'S THE SAME SHIT ON THE BACK. ALL RIGHT? GOOD NIGHT. - GOOD NIGHT, LARRY. YEAH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. [switch clicks] [sighs] WHAT ARE YOUR FRIENDS LIKE? I DON'T REALLY HAVE FRIENDS. WELL, WHO DO YOU HANG OUT WITH? NOBODY. WHY DO I THINK YOU'RE NOT EXAGGERATING? I JUST KEEP TO MYSELF. I GO ABOUT MY BUSINESS, YOU KNOW. DO MY WORK. A CHARMING, LOVEABLE GUY LIKE YOURSELF? YOU SHOULD GET OUT MORE. I'M SURE THERE'S A TON OF STRAIGHT WOMEN WHO YOU COULD MAKE VERY HAPPY. LOUIS WANTS US TO CUT THE KID'S THUMB OFF.

HOW WOULD YOU GET AROUND IT? I'D WORK IT OUT. BUT FIRST I GOT TO KNOW, ARE YOU WITH ME? SURE. SURE OR YES? THAT'S THE SAME THING. NO, IT'S NOT THE SAME THING. SEE, IF I WERE TO ASK YOU TO MOVE MY COUCH FOR ME, YOU'D PROBABLY SAY, "SURE." BUT IF I WERE TO ASK YOU TO LOOK DEEP INTO MY EYES, AND TELL ME FROM THE BOTTOM OF YOUR HEART IF IT WOULD GIVE YOU GREAT PLEASURE IF I WERE TO SUCK YOUR COCK FOR 12 HOURS, IF I MAY BE PRESUMPTUOUS, YOU'D PROBABLY SAY, "YES." SEE, IT JUST IMPLIES A DIFFERENT LEVEL OF COMMITMENT. ASK ME THE QUESTION AGAIN. OK. ARE YOU WITH ME? YES. GOOD. - ISN'T THIS "B" LEVEL? - THIS IS "D" LEVEL. YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE HERE. WELL, I'M LOOKING FOR "B" LEVEL. NO, THIS IS A "D" LEVEL AND NO ONE IS ALLOWED ON "D" LEVEL. SO YOU NEED TO GO BACK TO "B" LEVEL. OK, HOLD ON, BECAUSE YOU'RE CONFUSING ME, OK? NO, YOU'RE CONFUSING ME. LET'S JUST START FROM THE BEGINNING. IF THIS ISN'T "B"-- [gasping] OH, MY GOD. OH, MY GOD. I AM SO SORRY. - OH, THAT'S OK. - I'M SORRY. SHH. (Ricki) JUST SOAK THAT IN COLD WATER AND IT'LL COME RIGHT OUT, OK? I PROMISE YOU. YES. NO, IT WILL. IT WILL. LOOK, THE THING IS, THE REASON I'M HERE IS THEY TOLD ME TO GO AROUND THE CORNER... - CLOSE YOUR EYES. - WHAT? [whispering] CLOSE YOUR EYES. FOLLOW ME. JUST WALK IN. CLOSE YOUR EYES. DON'T LOOK.

YOU'RE OLD-SCHOOL, TOO, LARRY. YOU'RE OLD-SCHOOL. [Larry snorts] [crackling] SO WE GOT AN ITEM THAT WE WANNA PACKAGE OURSELVES AND, UH, YOU KNOW... - MAIL OUT. - OK. SO COULD WE JUST GET, LIKE, AN ENVELOPE FROM YOU? WHAT SIZE WOULD YOU LIKE? JUST THE TOP, RIGHT-- - SIX BY NINE. - YEAH. SO, ALL RIGHT. - WE'RE DONE, RIGHT? - MMM-HMM. THAT'S IT. ALL RIGHT, THEN. [laughing] YEAH. THANKS. [paper crackling] WOULD YOU LIKE YOUR PARCEL INSURED? [chuckles] NO, THAT'S ALL RIGHT. I'LL BE RIGHT BACK. FRIEND OF YOURS? CLOSE PERSONAL. [slams door] [starts car] YOU KNOW SOMETHING? YOU'RE RIGHT. IT IS SADNESS. IT'S SADNESS, AND I'M FUCKING SAD. YOU GOT ME. YOU'RE A GENIUS. YOU KNOW WHY I'M FUCKING SAD? BECAUSE I GOT THIS FUCKING BEAUTIFUL, SEXY, GORGEOUS HEARTTHROB-O-RAMA, FUCKING SMART, AMAZING BOMBSHELL, 17-ON-A-FUCKING-10-SCALE GIRL SLEEPING IN A BED RIGHT NEXT TO ME. (Larry) AND YOU KNOW WHAT? SHE'S A STONE-COLD DYKE. A FUCKING UNTOUCHABLE, UNHAVEABLE, UNATTAINABLE BRICK WALL FUCKING DYKEASAURUS REXI. SO IT'S SAD, OK? WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO? I FEEL FUCKING SADNESS ABOUT THAT. THERE'S NOTHING I CAN FUCKING DO. AND NOT ONLY IS SHE A MAJOR BABE, BUT I REALLY LIKE THIS GIRL A LOT. A LOT. I MEAN, SHE'S NOT LIKE ANYBODY ELSE I EVER KNEW BEFORE, AND THAT'S A COMPLETELY FUCKING NEW ONE ON ME. AND I DON'T EVEN KNOW HER REAL FUCKING NAME. SO THERE YOU GO. OH, AND IN CASE YOU'RE INTERESTED, MY LIFE SUCKS. ALL RIGHT? STICK A FORK IN ME, I'M DONE. [laughing] [squeaking from T.V.] CLEAN THE BAR ALL YOU LIKE. I'M JUST GONNA PUKE ON IT AGAIN. (ape #1) OH, YOU GOT ME. (ape #2) OH! I GOT YOU! OH! [keys jingling] DO YOU THINK YOUR FINGERNAILS NEED TRIMMING? THEY'RE FINE. WHAT? YOU DON'T LIKE MY FINGERNAILS NOW? LOOK, I HAVE NO IDEA IF THIS IS TRUE OR NOT, BUT I'VE HEARD IT SAID THAT THOSE WHO ARE BALANCED MORE TOWARD THE MASCULINE OF EITHER SEX CHECK THEIR FINGERNAILS THIS WAY. AND THOSE BALANCED MORE TOWARD THE FEMININE CHECK THEM THAT WAY. AND I JUST HAD A FEELING THAT EVEN THOUGH YOU HAVE THIS TOUGH GUY THING GOING ON, THAT YOU... ARE WRESTLING WITH SOME VERY STRONG FEMININE LEANINGS. (Larry) THAT'S FUCKIN' BULLSHIT. I--I CAN'T SEE. I'M FARSIGHTED. NEARSIGHTED. WHATEVER IT IS. SO I HOLD 'EM OUT HERE, BUT I CAN'T SEE 'EM UP CLOSE. YOU WANNA FIND OUT HOW SOMEBODY'S BALANCED TOWARD A MASCULINE, LOOK AT ME. I CAN'T SEE. THAT'S WHY I HOLD 'EM FAR AWAY. - [chuckling] ALL RIGHT. - YEAH, IT IS ALL RIGHT. NO, ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT. I WAS GONNA GO LIKE THIS, THAT'S WHAT I WANNA DO. BUT I KNOW I CAN'T SEE, SO I HOLD THEM OUT THERE TO LOOK AT 'EM. ALL RIGHT. DON'T GIVE ME THAT LOOK. I SEE YOU LOOKING AT ME. ARE YOU GAY? WHAT THE FUCK. NO! I'M NOT GAY! I AM NOT GAY. WHY DO YOU LOOK AT ME AND THINK I'M GAY? I AM NOT FUCKING GAY! ARE YOU SURE? YEAH, I'M FUCKIN' SURE. YOU KNOW WHAT, I BET YOU'RE RIGHT. - THANK YOU. - IT WASN'T A COMPLIMENT. RICKI, WHATEVER YOUR REAL NAME IS, ALL RIGHT, THIS IS MY EYES. LOOK--LOOK--LOOK HOW I'M ACTING. YOU'RE DRIVING ME CRAZY. YOU, LIKE, FUCKIN' GIVE ME A FUCKIN' H-H-HEADACHE. I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY I HAD A CRUSH ON YOU BACK A LONG TIME WHEN I FIRST MET YOU, THAT YOU REALLY CURED ME OF. I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE YOU KNOW I CAN KICK YOUR ASS. MAYBE THAT TURNS YOU ON. YOU CANNOT KICK MY ASS. OW! WHAT? [chuckles] YOU--YOU NEED A WOMAN. I GOT ONE. OW! STOP. KISS ME AGAIN. I THOUGHT YOU WANTED TO BE MY BITCH. THIS IS SO FUCKED UP. WHERE YOU GOIN'? IT'S TURKEY TIME. HUH? GOBBLE, GOBBLE. WHAT? NOW, YOU TALK THE TALK, YOU KNOW I'M EXPECTING YOU TO WALK THE WALK. COME ON. SHOW ME WHAT I'VE BEEN MISSING MY WHOLE LIFE. LAY SOME OF THAT SWEET HETEROLINGUS ON ME. I THINK, UH, TO BE SERIOUS... - MMM? I JUST... YOU KNOW, I THINK... I WAS THINKING, YOU KNOW, AND YOU WERE RIGHT WHEN YOU SAID, YOU KNOW, PROBABLY, ACTUALLY A WOMAN MIGHT KNOW MORE ABOUT WHAT FEELS BETTER TO ANOTHER WOMAN. SHE'S A WOMAN HERSELF. A GUY MIGHT BE AT A CERTAIN DISADVANTAGE. YOU KNOW, LIKE, UH... IT'S LIKE, YOU NEED, LIKE, A HANDICAP. YOU KNOW, LIKE GOLF. SHUT UP AND GET OVER HERE. OH! [laughing] GOD BLESS YOU, PENIS. WHAT'D YOU SAY? NOTHIN'. EVERY RELATIONSHIP HAS A BULL AND A COW, HUH? THAT'S RIGHT. MMMMMMOOOO! JUST TO BE UP FRONT ABOUT ALL THIS... - MMM? - WHEN THIS GIG IS OVER, I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT I'M GONNA BE LEAVING. [phone ringing] [rings] - YEAH? - (Louis) LISTEN, YOU AND TRIXIE OVER THERE, MEET ME AT BEVERLY AND LOMITAS. LOUIS, WHAT'S GOING ON? AND DON'T BRING THE THING. - THE WHAT? - THE THING. - DON'T BRING THE THING. - WHAT THING? THE THING! DON'T BRING-- DON'T BRING IT. - OH, YOU MEAN THE, UH... - YEAH. DON'T BRING IT. YOU LEAVE IT SOMEWHERE SAFE FOR THE TIME BEING. - ALL RIGHT. - YOU UNDERSTAND? - YEAH, I UNDERSTAND, I UNDERSTAND. - AND HURRY UP, JACKASS. [phone clicks] WHAT? IT'S LOUIS. HE'S FUCKIN' PISSED. (Larry) SEE THIS? SOME COOKIES IN THERE. WE'LL BE BACK. - WHEN ARE YOU COMING BACK? - SOON. JUST RELAX, EAT YOUR BREAKFAST. OK? I'M NOT HUNGRY, THOUGH. WELL, YOU CAN'T SKIP BREAKFAST. IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT MEAL. ALL RIGHT? DON'T GO NOWHERE. DON'T TOUCH NOTHING. DON'T MAKE ANY PHONE CALLS. I'M NOT KIDDING. ALL RIGHT, LARRY. ALL RIGHT. SEE YOU LATER. BYE, RICKI. BYE, BRIAN. WHAT? NOTHIN'. YOU KNOW, I GOT THIS, UH, FANTASY. ABOUT MAKING IT WITH A GUY? [snorts, laughs] NO. [laughing] THAT'S NOT IT. GOING SOMEWHERE, YOU KNOW, LIKE, SOMEWHERE REALLY, REALLY, UH...CLEAN. CLEAN? YEAH. NO SCUMBAGS TELLING YOU WHAT TO DO. NOBODY YELLING AT YOU ALL THE TIME. SOMEPLACE YOU COULD JUST BE. [birds chirping] BE YOURSELF. NO BAD STUFF. THAT SOUNDS GOOD. WHAT'S UP? WE HAVE A VISITOR FROM NEW YORK. FOLLOW ME. [starts engine] HELLO. WELCOME. NICE TO MEET YOU. - HELLO, SIR. - FINALLY. NICE TO MEET YOU, TOO. COME. WOW, LOOK AT YOU. BEAUTIFUL. COME ON IN. HERE. GRAB A COUCH. SIT, SIT. I SAY EVERYTHING TWICE. IN, IN. SIT, SIT. I'M SO GLAD YOU COULD COME ON SUCH A SHORT NOTICE, TOO. THANK YOU, I REALLY APPRECIATE IT. I REALLY... I THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE IT. HERE, I'VE GOT SOME STUFF. I'M SORRY IF I'M A BIT OF A MESS, BUT I JUST GOT IN A FEW HOURS AGO. I'M SURE LOUIS TOLD YOU, YOU KNOW, I'M HAVING, UH, SOME LITTLE LEGAL PROBLEMS OUT HERE RIGHT NOW. WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO? IT'S A REAL NUISANCE, BUT WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO? I GOT TO FIGHT IT, RIGHT? I MEAN, I CAN'T GO TO JAIL. THAT JUST CAN'T HAPPEN. HUH? I'M USED TO THE FINER THINGS. LOUIS, AM I RIGHT? YOU ARE RIGHT. IT CAN'T BE. SO I THINK WE CAN SAY BEYOND A SHADOW OF A DOUBT, THAT IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN. (Starkman) HUH? SOMEWHERE, A MISTAKE HAS BEEN MADE. DID YOU KNOW THAT APPARENTLY SOME PEOPLE DO NOT REGARD THE THUMB, TECHNICALLY, TO BE A FINGER? CURIOUS FOR MYSELF, I TURNED TO LOUIS HERE, WHO, WITH HIS NEWFOUND DICTIONARY SKILLS, LOOKED IT UP FOR ME. YOU KNOW WHAT IT SAID? NO. TELL HIM WHAT IT SAID, LOUIS. [clears throat] IT SAID, QUOTE: "THE SHORT, THICK, INNER DIGIT OF THE HAND NEXT TO THE FOREFINGER." UNQUOTE. NOW IT SAID, "DIGIT," NOT "FINGER." SO I STILL DON'T REALLY KNOW, TECHNICALLY, IF IT'S CONSIDERED A FINGER OR NOT. RIGHT? - RIGHT. RIGHT. LOOK AT HIM. I LOVE HIM. I LOVE THIS GUY. HE EATS NO MATTER WHAT. I LOVE YOU, LOUIS. WHAT'S THIS? WHAT IS THIS? LOUIS... I'VE BEEN SUBPOENAED. I CAN'T BE CONSORTING WITH ARMED FELONS. A LITTLE CONSIDERATION, PLEASE. BESIDES, YOU THINK SOMETHING LIKE THIS IS NECESSARY, ANYWAY, TO INTIMIDATE PEOPLE? I SAY INTIMIDATION COMES FROM WITHIN. THERE ARE A MULTITUDE OF QUALITIES AN INDIVIDUAL CAN POSSESS THAT MAKE THEM INTIMIDATING. NOT ONLY THIS, THIS IS THE OUTSIDE. THEN THERE'S THE INSIDE. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT'S THE MOST INTIMIDATING QUALITY? NOT THAT YOU ASKED. BUT THE ABSOLUTELY MOST INTIMIDATING, IN MY OPINION? WHEN AN INDIVIDUAL JUST DOESN'T GIVE A SHIT. LOUIS, YOU WANNA GO TO MEDICAL SCHOOL? MEDICAL SCHOOL? [gasps] YES! STUDENTS THERE CAN ALWAYS USE SOMETHING TO LEARN ON. [wheezing laugh] I FEEL LIKE I'M FLOATING. (Starkman) I FEEL... RELEASED. I DON'T GIVE A SHIT. I DON'T. I HAVE NO COMPUNCTIONS, NONE WHATSOEVER. AND I AM VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE WAY THINGS HAVE TURNED OUT HERE. HOW WAS THE BLEEDING? THE BLEEDING? NO, NO, NO. NOT HIM. [wheezing laugh] THE RETARD, WHEN YOU CUT HIS THUMB OFF. LOUIS, UH, TOLD ME YOU WERE CONCERNED. BLEEDING WAS FINE. FINE? IT WAS ALL RIGHT. OK. GOOD. I DIDN'T NEED YOUR HELP, YOU KNOW. I COULD HAVE BEATEN THESE CHARGES. WHAT WERE YOU THINKING? YOU WERE GONNA EXTORT A FEDERAL PROSECUTOR. YOU THOUGHT YOU COULD SAY... "KIDNAPPED YOUR LITTLE BROTHER, DROP ALL CHARGES," AND THE GUY'D ROLL OVER? YOU DIDN'T THINK ALL HELL WOULDN'T BREAK LOOSE? YOU DIDN'T THINK EVERY FUCKING FED WOULDN'T DROP WHATEVER THEY WERE DOING AND DIVE IN TO PROTECT ONE OF THEIR OWN? WHAT DO YOU MORONS THINK, THIS IS LITTLE ITALY?! WAKE UP! THIS IS THE TWENTY-FUCKING-FIRST CENTURY! SO NOW... THINGS ARE BAD. AND WHETHER YOU WANNA CALL A THUMB A FINGER OR A DIGIT, FOR THE SAKE OF THIS DISCUSSION, IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER. YOU KNOW WHY? BECAUSE WHATEVER YOU CHOOSE TO CALL IT, A THUMB HAS A FINGERPRINT, AND THE ONE YOU SENT HAD THE WRONG FUCKING ONE. MR. STARKMAN-- I KNOW MY FUCKING NAME, YOU PIECE OF SHIT! YOU DON'T TRY TO EXTORT A FEDERAL FUCKING PROSECUTOR! AND IF YOU DO, YOU DON'T FUCK AROUND! FUCK THIS. CUTTING OFF HIS THUMB WAS A STUPID ORDER AND WE WOULD HAVE BEEN DERELICT IN OUR RESPONSIBILITIES IF WE HAD FOLLOWED IT. HELLO. HOW LONG DO YOU THINK WE COULDA KEPT BELOW THE RADAR WITH A THUMBLESS, BLEEDING HALF-WIT? YOU SEE, SOMETIMES ONE HAS TO USE THEIR PROFESSIONAL PREROGATIVE TO OVERRIDE A DUMB REQUEST. WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, EVEN AT THIS POINT IF YOU WERE TO ASK US TO PURSUE A COURSE OF ACTION THAT WOULD BE, LET'S SAY, CONTRARY TO YOUR BEST INTERESTS, THEN AS AWKWARD AS IT MIGHT BE, WE WOULD HAVE TO TAKE EXCEPTION. ASIDE FROM THOSE OF US HERE IN THIS ROOM, THERE IS ONLY ONE PERSON, REALLY, THAT CAN LINK YOU TO THIS FUCK-UP. AND I FEEL THAT WE SHOULD... RECTIFY THAT PROBLEM AS SOON AS WE CAN. I THINK I'D MUCH PREFER JUST TO, YOU KNOW, END IT RIGHT HERE. HMM. AND THAT WOULD BE YOUR PROFESSIONAL PREROGATIVE. IF YOU THINK THAT HAVING THAT KID PICKED UP BY THE AUTHORITIES AND TELLING THEM ALL ABOUT BEING KIDNAPPED IN AN ATTEMPT TO SAVE YOUR ASS MAKES ANY SENSE. IF YOU THINK THAT'S THE BEST TACTIC TO KEEP YOU OUT OF JAIL. IF YOU THINK THAT'S ANY LESS DUMB THAN ASKING TO HAVE HIS FINGER CUT OFF, [chuckling] WELL, THEN THAT WOULD BE THE THING THAT YOU SHOULD DO. BUT IF YOU DON'T, THEN LET US TAKE THE THORN OUT OF YOUR SIDE. LET US MAKE SURE THAT KID WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO TESTIFY AGAINST ANYBODY. AND IF AFTER THAT YOU'RE STILL NOT HAPPY, THEN WE CAN ALL TALK AGAIN. (Larry) YOU WERE KIDDING, RIGHT? - (Ricki) WHAT DO YOU THINK? WE'LL JUST TAKE BRIAN BACK TO WHERE YOU FOUND HIM AND GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE. ARE WE GOING TO THE BAYWATCH NOW? NO, WE CAN'T GO TO THE BAYWATCH NOW. TAKE YOU LATER. MAYBE THIS IS IT. I MEAN, MAYBE THIS IS THE THING, YOU KNOW. MAYBE THIS IS, LIKE, A SIGN COMING FROM NOWHERE, FROM OUT OF THE BLUE, JUST TELLING ME IT'S TIME. IT'S TIME TO GET OUT. IT'S TIME TO DO IT. â™ª WHEN I'M ALONE IN MY ROOM SOMETIMES I STARE AT THE WALL â™ª â™ª AND IN THE BACK OF MY MIND I HEAR MY CONSCIENCE CALL â™ª â™ª TELLING ME I NEED A GIRL WHO'S AS SWEET AS A DOVE â™ª â™ª FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE I COULD SEE I NEED LOVE â™ª â™ª SO IF YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE WILLING TO MAKE YOURSELF SEEN â™ª â™ª TAKE A CHANCE WITH MY LOVE AND FIND OUT WHAT I MEAN â™ª â™ª I NEED LOVE â™ª â™ª [humming] â™ª BRIAN. â™ª I NEED LOVE â™ª LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING. YOU GOT A GIRLFRIEND? NO, I DON'T. LET ME DO SOMETHING FOR YOU, OK, 'CAUSE, YOU KNOW, TO MAKE UP FOR ALL THE PROBLEMS I CAUSED YOU. 'CAUSE I SEE YOU'RE A LITTLE-- A LITTLE NERVOUS AROUND WOMEN. RIGHT? LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING. YOU GOT NO REASON TO BE SHY. THERE'S NO MAGIC TO IT. LET--LET ME TELL YOU THIS THING THAT I HEARD, AND I'M STARTING TO BELIEVE THAT IT'S TRUE. [chuckling] YOU KNOW? IT'S THAT, LIKE, THE THING YOU'RE MOST AFRAID OF IN LIFE, IF YOU DO IT, IF YOU STEP UP, GOOD THINGS WILL HAPPEN. YOU SEE A GIRL THAT YOU LIKE THAT YOU'RE SCARED TO TALK TO, BRO, STEP UP. GO UP TO HER AND SAY: "HI, HOW ARE YOU TODAY? NICE WEATHER WE'RE HAVING." YOU KNOW, TAKE IT FROM THERE, WHEREVER THE CONVERSATION GOES. ALL RIGHT, YOU TRY IT. TRY IT WITH ME. PRACTICE. GO AHEAD. HELLO, HOW ARE YOU TODAY? TRY IT WITH ME. GO AHEAD. JUST SAY IT. HELLO, HOW ARE YOU TODAY? COME ON. HELLO. HELLO? HELLO. HOW ARE YOU TODAY? HOW--HOW ARE YOU TODAY? NICE WEATHER WE'RE HAVING. NICE WEATHER WE'RE HAVING. THERE YOU GO. YOU SEE HOW HE DID IT? IT'S BECAUSE YOU STEPPED UP, BRIAN. IF YOU'RE AFRAID, STEP UP AND GOOD THINGS START TO HAPPEN. AM I RIGHT? I STEPPED UP. STEP IT UP, PIMP. THAT'S HOW YOU DO. STEP IT UP. SO, UH, NOW THAT WE'RE PARTNERS IN CRIME, HOW ABOUT TELLING ME YOUR REAL NAME? THE REASON THAT I ASK THAT IS BECAUSE, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU GAVE IT ANY THOUGHT SINCE LAST NIGHT, BUT I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT IT. AND SEEING, YOU KNOW, LOOKS LIKE NOW WE'RE BOTH GONNA BE LEAVING. SO I THOUGHT, YOU KNOW... ALL RIGHT, LOOK. I'M GONNA LAY IT ALL OUT THERE FOR YOU RIGHT NOW. I'M JUST GONNA SAY IT, BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, HERE I AM. I THINK-- LARRY. YOU KNOW I HAVEN'T DONE THIS KIND OF THING HARDLY EVER. YOU KNOW, THE WHOLE MAN THING DOESN'T REALLY HOLD THAT MUCH FOR ME, USUALLY. I KNOW. BUT SOMEHOW YOU GOT THROUGH. SOMEHOW. BUT IN THE END... I DON'T THINK I COULD EVER BE WHAT YOU REALLY WANT. SO WHERE DO YOU THINK YOU'LL GO? (Ricki) I DON'T KNOW. SOMEWHERE CLEAN. YOU KNOW, NORTHERN CALIFORNIA, OREGON MAYBE. YOU COULD JUST DROP ME OFF ANYWHERE NEAR THE PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY AND I'LL FIGURE IT OUT FROM THERE. OK. AFTER THAT, BRIAN, UH, I THINK IT'S GONNA BE TIME TO GO HOME. WE JUST LEFT THERE A LITTLE WHILE AGO, THOUGH. I DON'T MEAN MY APARTMENT. I MEAN, YOU KNOW, THE PLACE WHERE YOU LIVE. WHERE I GOT YOU. WHAT, YOU MEAN TO STAY? YEAH, BUDDY. TO STAY. OH, MY GOD. OH, MY GOD. OH, MY GOD. OH, MY GOD. OH, MY GOD. - IT'S OPEN. OH MY GOD. - WHAT ARE YOU DOING? - SIT DOWN. - LOOK, IT'S OPEN! HO HO HO! - BRIAN, WHAT? WHAT'S HE TALKING ABOUT? THEY'RE OPEN.
