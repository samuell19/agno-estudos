Okay, are we recording? Yes. It is July 27, 1916. Private Charles Nagy, 29th combat infantry regiment and our Colonel Joseph Amen speaking. We now have a full hour right behind us. Nothing in particular happened so far. The privates Nadesti, Marik, and Teweger were given orders to confiscate several gasoline barrels from the property. We are here on the homestead in Czinkota, east of Budapest. We haven't come across anybody. No... Something is wrong here. We are moving behind the house. We have made a horrible discovery. Never before have I seen anything like this. Only the devil himself could have done this. We're here on the property of Bela Kiss. Loving friends... Loving partner... Loving family... What are we willing to sacrifice for this love? What's wrong? Julia. I got a bad feeling. Maybe you should take a back road. You're just being paranoid again. Right, 'cause you're the one giving the orders here, right? Hey, guys, everything's gone really smoothly so far, so why don't we just relax a little? Yeah, well, we're taking a back road. Doesn't matter, anyway, so my buddy picks up this chick, right, I mean they're both totally wasted, it's obvious they're gonna bone, I mean, they're chewing each other's faces off. Back at his place, she realizes that it's... Aunt Flow has paid a visit. So anyway, she realizes that it's that time of the month but she's like, "Whatever, he's, you know, he's so drunk, he won't even notice." So they go for it. But the next morning, he wakes up alone. He folds down the blankets and it's a fucking mess, like, it's full of blood. And he's like, "Holy shit, what have I done? Jesus Christ!" So he jumps out of bed, he runs to the gun safe, and they're all there. "I didn't shoot her." The knife block. So he runs to the kitchen and he counts all the knives and they're all there. "I didn't stab her, either." Then he goes to take a leak, and he passes the mirror and he stops. "Holy shit. I ate her." What now? I can't see shit. Well, maybe we should just check. Wait, I think something's not right here. Come on. What the hell was that? Shots, those were... Gun shots, right? Hey, be quiet. Hi. My car. My car. I'll move it in a minute. Uh, okay. I... I haven't got a good feeling about this. Don't... don't open the window. Hi, guys. My car isn't starting. Can you give me a jump start? We don't have a jumper cable, sorry. No problem. I got one in the back. It'll be quick. In that case... Is that blood there on your hand? I hit a deer. It was bleeding pretty bad so I had to kill it. Okay. I'm the ranger. Okay, I'll start it. Whenever you're ready. Where do you want to go anyway? You hit the deer head on? What? Oh, yeah, yeah. That's strange, 'cause I can't see anything. I hope you don't want to go to the hotel. Odd things happen there. But for that, you're one cock too many anyway. You think so, yeah? All right. I killed the fucking thing. Shoot me. Well, come on. Just start the van and I pull over. Five robbers that held up the Central Bank this morning are still at large. Three men and two women in their 20s escaped in an old Volkswagen van. The suspects are armed and dangerous. Caution is advised. What the fuck is going on here? Easy there, it must be a misunderstanding. Fuck you! You fucking trouts! Get out of the fucking car! No need to get rude now. Shut up, faggot! Give me your guns. They're in the car, um... Get them! Slowly! How about we all just go about our business and nobody gets hurt? Throw them over here. Is this supposed to be a joke? No, they're fake because we didn't want to hurt anybody. Please, just let us go... I gotta call the cops. Oh, shit, oh, shit. Julia, sweetheart, it's okay. It just grazed you. Let me see. This is all your fault! We said no real weapons, no casual... What? You want to shoot me, too? I'll tell you what I'm gonna do. I'll get rid of this guy. And you, you move this piece of shit. Oh, you gotta be kidding. Hello? Yeah, I'm really sorry. Yeah, we just... We had a little incident here. Nothing to worry about. Okay. Don't forget your documents from this weekend's conference. Thanks. If it wasn't for you... Then you probably wouldn't be on business trips all the time. - Good afternoon. - Hello. Welcome to Bell Hotel Hoffmann. We really gotta hurry up because you got to be back at eight. My name's Ms. Jakubec. I'm the lady of the house. And you are Mister... Bad Wolf. Big Bag Wolf. Very good. Under what name may I sign in your friends? This is Ms. L... I beg your pardon. Mr. and Mrs. Rumpelstiltskin. I hope you enjoyed your stay. It was lovely, as always. I'm very pleased to hear that. And it will be a pleasure to welcome you again soon. Yeah, just right in time for the next conference. So long. Excuse me, Mr. Big Bad Wolf. It's fine. So this is Ms. Little Red Riding Hood. These are, well, the three little pigs. Very well, please sign here. Yeah. How long do you intend to stay? A few days, maybe. Excellent. That's longer than our guests usually stay. Dinner will be served in an hour. You must be very hungry after your long journey. Here are the keys to your rooms. Unfortunately, adjacent rooms were no longer available. We're fully booked. Are you injured, miss? Oh, no, no, it's nothing. Just a scratch. There's first aid boxes in each room. Thank you. It's almost over. I can't believe it. - Be over in a minute. - Looks worse than I thought. I know. That really hurts. I know, I know. I'm sorry, dear. Yes. Better? Thanks. I love you. You know, if we hadn't listened to Nick, none of this would have happened. He was just trying to help us. Jules, he killed a man. A man who shot at me. Felix, he's one of my oldest friends. I trust him. But you've got to trust me. I love you so much. I want to start a family with you. I... You're crazy. I know. I know you know. You know what? I just can't right now. All right. I'm sorry. What's the matter with you lately? Unfortunately, the Cabinet did not come to an agreement on this matter. A final decision is expected to be announced publicly this Thursday. In local news, the police are still searching for the five suspects in the bank robbery case. They are in their 20s and fled in a VW van. People are advised to be cautious, not to pick up hitch hikers, and to inform the local police about any information they may have on this developing story. There you are. Take a look at the menu. Did you notice anything? Nothing but meat. Oh, your favorite. Everything okay? Yeah, everything's okay. Yeah, it just hurts a little bit. So, what's the deal? You in a hurry? Okay, listen, Right now, they're looking for us. So we might have to stick around for a bit. Make yourselves at home, guys. Good evening. It's a pleasure to have you. I've prepared a little welcome drink for you. Our house wine. And may I also introduce to you, Sir Pester-Haigh. He will be serving you during your stay. At your service. Ladies, gentlemen. Enjoy. Oh, the good carpet! Have you decided? Um, excuse me, do you have anything that's vegetarian friendly? How cocky can you be? My apologies. Meat is all we have left. Yeah, but I don't eat that. I'm very sorry, miss. You've got to have something else. Just get her a steak anyway. She'll eat it, thank you. Very well. Cheers. Cheers. This place is weird, I'm telling you. What? What, we don't have these over there. Do you remember the last time we had them? Yeah, at the candy store. We used to steal them. And you remember Mr. Cretu from the orphanage? Remember how he used to snap when he heard about it and he'd start yelling at us, "You two one day..." and shake his finger at us? I remember. It's good to have you back. You're nervous? What? No. I'm not doing that. How are you doing that? That's not me either. Still wearing it, huh? Mm-hmm. Nikolai, don't... don't do that, please. Is that your soon-to-be? Yes. Why? Just curious. Please don't take that the wrong way. What could I take wrong? It's actually none of my business. Everyone knows Julia is my girlfriend. You booked two doubles and a single, I just wasn't sure which gentleman would stay in the single. My mother, God bless her soul, she always used to say, "Love can do anything but walking on a tightrope." But it can't. If you need anything, you know where to find me. May 18, 1912. We have finally arrived in Czinkota. My wife Marie and I. It is close to Budapest. And we have a perfect little farmhouse nearby. I have never been to this part of Hungary. But I believe it will make a fitting place to devote myself to my work and to my needs. Twenty-three Kosert Street. The house is well-furnished. But Marie doesn't like it much. I can tell. My work is going well, and I'm starting to feel quite at home. But Marie... Marie's seduced by the big city. Budapest. A ghastly mark greedily luring criminals and whores. Marie spends much of her time there. Mounting to my many sleepless nights. I am lost to understand how she's drawn to such a place. So this is why we move to the country? Marie never was an attentive wife to me but... Since arriving here, she's a stranger. But I used to love her. Women. A trap of nature. They say love transcends death. But tonight... Your wallet. Now. I said now! I died twice. WBK 2.3 news. It's 8 o'clock in the morning and my name is Charlie. Welcome to the local news. The unsuccessful search for the five bank robbers that held up the Central Bank has been called off. The police commissioner in charge of this case has ordered the checkpoints to end. Those checkpoints caused much road confusion and traffic jams. That's it now from your news team. Over to Camellia with the weather forecast. Felix? Is that you? We used to have fun with Nick a couple years ago, remember? The exchange string that we used to pull at the banks? Oh, yeah, that's right. Wait, we'll take that in fifties. No, a hundred. No, wait, we'll take that in pounds. So dumb. We kept going until the clerk was all confused. And we walked away with several grand extra cash. What's the founding of a bank compared with the robbing of a bank, anyway? What's up? Look at these barrels. Sophie, what are you doing? What does it look like? I'm being curious. Fuck. Let me try. Fuck. They're sealed really tight. You are interested in the barrels? Uh, we're just... We just wondered why all those barrels are standing around here. I mean, what's in them? You would like to know what's inside? Ah, the youth of today. Always a little curious. You know what? It's not that important. We better leave. One moment, please. Since I'm responsible for your welfare, I don't want to leave you unsatisfied. Please, follow me. That's not necessary. We can just... We can go back to the hotel. By all means. Why did you have to mess with the fucking barrels? When the hotel was built, the power grid wasn't very widespread. Therefore, we are not connected to it out here. We have to utilize a power generator. 'Kay, and that's why the barrels... Contain the necessary gasoline. What do you suppose barrels with "gasoline" written on them contain? Where's Felix? What? Where's Felix? He'll be back in a few minutes. Be right back. Hello? What's the matter, Julia? I don't trust that woman. Someone seems to be a little jealous. No. Hey. Where's Nick? Uh, he's on the phone. I'd really like to know how much longer we'll have to stay here. What were you talking about with the manager? Oh... Nothing. Small talk. When are we leaving? Well, on the radio they said that the cops have increased their checkpoints. So we might have to stay a few more days. And they also put a price on our heads. Outstanding. Is that so? What are you trying to say? I don't know. I just wonder why you keep the only radio and all the money. Oh, and the next time the boss calls I want to talk to him myself. Why are you so stressed, man? It just pisses me off that we keep playing "Nikolai Says." Excuse me. Do you mind refraining from smoking your cigarette? Unfortunately, smoking is prohibited in these rooms. The other guests feel slightly irritated by it. Well, there can't be too many, but if it makes you happy. In the face of death... All else is meaningless. There is nothing but the empty cold when Father Death rips the soul from one's body. Nothing as horrifying as the final dissolution of the self. Death is the oldest and deepest fear of man. To escape death... The eternal dream. That night, time stopped dead and saved my life. And it left me with the realization of astounding significance. I cannot put it into words, but I know that death is but a dream. December 19th, 1912. Marie Kiss has left with her lover. This is what I tell the neighbors. They believe me. The whole town feels compassion. I have recently hired a housekeeper. She is eager to work and does so with diligence. She is more rewarding than my wife was. My wife, the whore. The nosey watchman asked me about the barrels today. So far, I have seven barrels directly behind the house. And others spread in the field. I tell them they're for storing gasoline, that the big war seems imminent. And I want to be prepared for shortages. I like living in the country, people are trusting and gullible. I have taken to courting women again. A feeling long missed that is slowly returning. A good feeling. Life. What was that? - Hey. - What? That, did you... Do you hear that? Sounds like someone's having fun. 'Scuse me, could you please bring it down a notch? Hello! Is everything okay? I think we should get someone. Who's next door? I... I don't know. Okay, now listen, man, I don't know what this is about but you think it's a little late for your jokes? Stop it right now, asshole! It stopped. What was that? I have no idea. Good afternoon, Mr. Bad Wolf. Ms. Jakubec. Unfortunately, smoking in the elevator is prohibited. Really? I know who you are. You and your little girlfriend. I know. We'd almost abandoned all hopes. We thought he's dead. We're here. All alone? Excuse me? That's unfortunate. May I sit with you? Sure. What do you mean, unfortunate? Usually our guests come here to enjoy their togetherness. What kind of hotel is this? You don't know? Well, this is a place for couples whose love for one another better remain a secret. Especially from their spouses. So you're saying this is some kind of no-tell motel? That's an unpleasant phrase. It's perfectly normal to have little secrets. Don't you think your girlfriend keeps any secrets from you? Forgive me if I seem a little indiscreet. But, what is it with your girlfriend? What... Was her name again? Julia. Right, Julia. Were you able to take my advice regarding her and your mutual friend? Now you're being indiscreet. Of course. I apologize. They're just old friends. Yes, a common childhood can forge a bond. Yes, they grew up in the same orphanage. Childhood friends. Just platonic? Yes. Don't you think Julia has ever lusted after another man that you didn't know about? We love each other. And love is a beautiful thing. However, sometimes... Lust is stronger. We see that here over and over again. It flows through your body. It's in the blood. Carnal desire. You feel it, too. Don't worry. It's only human. I should go back. The others are probably waiting. Very well. Good evening, Ms. Jakubec. Good afternoon, Mr. and Mrs. Puss in Boots. It's a pleasure to have you back. Dinner will be served shortly. Felix. Wait, wait, no. Stop it, stop it, please. Whatever. I'm sorry. I'm going to sleep. January 23, 1914. The Budapest police department is still searching for the two missing woman. Katherine Varga, and Carla Schmeidak. Where are you? According to witnesses, both women were last seen on the Margaret Bridge, accompanied by a man, a Mr. Hoffman, who has also disappeared without a trace. November 13, 1914. I will have to go to war. I have left everything to my devoted housekeeper. My fatherland calls me to its trenches. Just in time, I say. Sweet war. Only the dead have seen the end of it. July 29th, 1916. Twenty-three bloodless bodies discovered. In Czinkota, a town outside of Budapest, the local police were confronted with a scene of horror. Three soldiers were to confiscate gasoline barrels on Bela Kiss' property for war use. What they discovered in the barrels was not gasoline, but 23 bloodless bodies, preserved in alcohol. Bela Kiss himself is believed to be killed in action. One of many casualties of the bloody spring, 1916. Well nothing is as it seems, I guess. Everything's right, okay? I wonder where Felix is. I think he's outside. - Yeah? - Yeah. You know, I'm gonna go get some fresh air. Should I come with? No, that's okay. Check this out. - I'm really good at it. - Yeah. - Okay? - Mh-hm. You watching? Oh, fuck. Oh, brilliant, yeah. What's the matter, dear? I saw... I saw... There was a... there was a... You've had a little too much wine, is that possible? No, no, no. I saw there was a... A man with a... A knife, that... Shh, calm down, now. Breathe. Please, please listen to me, you've got to call somebody. Young lady, I believe the wine's somewhat gone to your head. Felix, Felix, I saw a murder upstairs and she won't believe me. I saw somebody get murdered upstairs in the room. Please. A murder in our hotel? Are you sure? Yes, yes, I'm sure, I saw it. It just happened a second ago, I... I know I'm not going crazy, I... Wait, wait... Can we just check, Ms. Jakubec? Honestly, I'm not thrilled to bother a guest at this time of night because of an absurd story like this. You do understand? Very well, come along. And you're sure it was on the third floor? Yes, I'm sure, I... I saw it, it was on this side. Here we are. This is the only occupied room on this floor. Okay, well then, we'd like to see. We won't do anything, young lady. I must emphasize again how inappropriate it is for me to be knocking on our guests' doors at this hour. Ms. Jakubec, could we just check to make sure? Very well, please stay back. See? Everything's fine. The woman is still in one piece. I'd like to check for myself. Just fun and games. That's enough. Thank you, Ms. Jakubec. And we're very sorry for the inconvenience. I told you to keep an eye on your little girlfriend. What the hell are you thinking? There was a murder, I know what I saw. We're wanted bank robbers. That means not to cause a goddamn scene. Felix, I saw somebody get killed. You've got to believe me. What? You're on her side now? Just keep imagining things like that. I wonder what else you dream up in your frickin' sick head. Ooh, I've seen a murder. Ooh, I am so frigid. It's all bullshit. You're such an asshole. You know what? Why don't you go fuck Ms. Jakubec, if that's what you need so badly. Oh yeah, and why don't you go to your beloved Nikolai, and maybe he can give you some? Maybe I will. I didn't know if he liked coffee or tea, so I... I offered him both. I spilled the milk. If I hadn't spilled the milk, I don't think... And then I tried to wipe it off him. It was like... He pulled the skin off my body. And then just left me there. Felix came home so late that night. I... was still in the shower. He asked me why I was still in the shower. It wasn't his fault. I should have told him. I should have told him right then. It's better that you didn't. Believe me. Were you looking for me? - No, no, I just want... - Shh. Is it this you need? Don't do this to yourself. Come on in. What are you doing here? Hey. Come here. In Bela Kiss' desk, countless postcards and letters were found, sent by women who were responding to an advertisement in which Bela Kiss passed himself off as a certain Mr. Hoffman, as an allegedly lonely widower who was looking for female company in order to lure helpless women into his house. His housekeeper, who was at the crime scene, and who was intended to be Bela Kiss' sole heir, claimed not to have noticed anything unusual. A certain Ms. Jakubec. Son? Son. Son, get down here. Good morning, dear. Oh. Good morning. Have you met my son? What? He's not exactly what you call a mother's pride and joy. He's a little bit shy because of his appearance. What are you talking about? My son. You'll meet him momentarily. Stop it. Be good now, just stay down. What? Frickin' gold, huh? Still looking for your family? They just disappeared and all they left was a locket and a cradle. Hey. How are you feeling? Hm? Aren't you gonna get it? Hello? Is everything arranged? Of course. I did you a favor with the bank. I'm glad everything worked out. You can count on me. So now, I expect you to obey my orders. I understand. It's time. I'm gonna look for Felix. I'm looking for Felix. Good morning. I've already served breakfast for you and your friends in the dining room. Delicious. I can't find Felix anywhere. I just saw Ms. Jakubec changing bloody sheets, and then I went up to our room, he's not there either. Nick, the money... Is the money still there? Let's go up to my room. Nick, can someone tell me what the hell is going on? - Lock the door. - Where's Felix? I don't know, that's what I'm trying to figure out. Nikolai, what is this place? Nick. Take the money, go to the van, and wait there for us. Hey. You wait there. And what about you? We'll look for Felix. Trust me, okay? We'll see you at the van. What the hell is taking them so long? Just stay cool, all right, they're gonna come. We just gotta... just gotta wait. Did you hear that? What was that? There. Lock the doors. Peter. Quiet! Where the fuck is it coming from? Fuck! Shit. What did you do? Shit. What did you do? I didn't do anything. Sophie, what did... I didn't do anything! Fuck! Let me try, let me try. What are we doing now? Peter, no. Sophie, have you got a better idea? What is that? Try it again. Yes! Hello? Is anyone here? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? What happened to you, love? What is this? There is a man. A man, he... He killed Peter. Shh, don't worry. He killed Peter. Just calm down. No, no, you don't understand! Just come with me, and you can tell me all about it. Take a deep breath. That's right. Let's get you cleaned up first. What are you doing? You're in luck. I was just going to make myself a nice cup of tea. No. Have one yourself. You don't understand, Peter is dead. It'll calm you down. Did you ever hear of winter fern? What are all those... cups doing on the floor? There's nothing like a nice, hot cup of tea. Are you enjoying yours? Apparently not. You know, it's fascinating. Winter fern is a paralyzing poison, but I assume you noticed that already yourself. We normally don't use it anymore. It leaves a bitter aftertaste in the blood. But then again, everybody has to make sacrifices. Isn't that right? Don't look at me dumbfounded like that, you little veggie twit. What would you do in this very moment in order to survive? Hmm? I lived through two world wars. Believe me, I know death. If Mr. Kiss hadn't saved me... Blood. For eternal life. Just like the vampires only without the fairy tales. And without these. Look at all this as a revelation. Five-hundred years ago, man thought the world was flat. Up to 200 years, they thought flying will forever be a dream. And until now you thought eternal life is preserved for gods? What distinguishes God from us anymore? Twenty-three bodies discovered. Preserved in alcohol. Anemic. The murderer, Bela Kiss... gets drafted to fight in World War I. He's killed in action on March 30th, 1916. But it wasn't Bela Kiss who died. Berlin has fallen. Berlin has fallen. Rumor has it that Bela Kiss was seen all around the globe for decades. But he never came back. Where did you bring us? I brought you home. Everything you've searched for your whole life, this is it. It's my father. No, this can't be my family. Hey, hey, Julia, listen, listen, he's found a way... He's found a way to live forever. Don't touch me. Where are the others? Don't be scared. It's just us now. You and me, we have a shot here, okay? Stop it! Where's Felix? What the fuck, after all he's fuckin' done to you! Stop it, leave me alone! Get away from me! Incapable moron. Too dumb to keep that little brat under control. His daughter, he never cared about such things in the past. There, that wasn't so difficult. Even my slow son could've figured that out. Nothing to be proud of. Your mother was just one of his little affairs. Shhh. I'm gonna get you down. I'm gonna get you down. I'm getting you down. Stay away, stay away from me. You think I haven't noticed you? Haven't smelled your blood? I've been watching you the whole time, little sister. Don't you ever think that my father cares for you! Do you think he loves you just because you wear this? What's wrong? I know who you are. Little sister. Your mother was just one of his little affairs. You've searched for your whole life. This is it. Just keep imagining things like that. I wonder what it was you dream up in your freakin' sick head. Where did you bring us? I brought you home. This can't be my family. Do you think he loves you just because you wear this? It's time. It's over. Nick. - Nick. - Yeah? I'm gonna get you outta here, okay? - Nick, Nick! - What? I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. You gotta go now. Go! Go. You can just let me out at the next town, okay? Thank you. What about your bike? You gonna get it later? It's not mine. Are you all right? Everything okay? Yes. Doctor, doctor, where are you taking me? I'm taking you to the morgue. I'm not even dead yet. We're not at the morgue yet. What a terrible joke. So, what's a nice girl like you doing on a country road with someone else's bike? It's my boyfriend's bike, well, ex-boyfriend. I could kill that asshole. What happened? I left work early to surprise him only to come home and catch him with that whore. Smoke? Thank you. Really not your day today, is it? Guess not. What kind of guy puts a death card in his car? A sadistic serial killer. So maybe another terrible joke would cheer you up? No, thank you. I wouldn't survive another one. If you say so. Please, stop! Stop, please! We're closed. Didn't you hear? Master. I... it didn't work out as we planned. Is that so? The plan hasn't even begun. Stop, freeze, police! You're my family. That's my father. He loves you. Excuse me, excuse me, are you okay? You're bleeding. Excuse me, miss? We're looking for Hotel Hoffmann. Actually, we're lost. Could you show us the way to the Hotel Hoffmann? I brought you home. Hoffmann. Yes, of course. I can show you the way. Wonderful. Would you like to have a ride with us? They could help you at the hotel. Everything you searched for your whole life. Everything you searched for your whole life. This is it. Just take a left here. Are ya sure? Yes, I'm sure. It's my way home. In the face of death, all else is meaningless. Only the devil himself could've done this. We're like family.
