So, Delise, thank you for telling us your story. This is perfect for us. This is exactly what we need. You know, we're looking for connection that Indigenous people have to the other side, you know, to family that have passed on. So, please, can you tell me about your brother? Yeah. Yeah. He was born after I had my two kids to Mum's third marriage. I didn't know him as a person, sort of concentrated on my own two sons and I never had much to do with him. Mum's 80th birthday was going to be held at my place and he was in a panic because he hadn't bought Mum a present. So we agreed to meet and I took him to the shopping centre. He chose a nice diamond chain pendant. I would have liked to have time to sit and talk, but the party was happening that night, so it was rush, rush, get home and prepare. He told Mum that he enjoyed our time together and that he wanted to get to know his big sister, but it wasn't to be. Well, I didn't know him that well. That day that we went shopping was the first time in 39 years that we actually... were alone together. We just never crossed paths that much. I'd worked up in the Northern Territory for 12 years and life just rolled along. Anyway, he called to visit that day and Mum was there visiting from the country. She was staying with me. Little did we know that would be the last time we'd see him. Two days after that, he took his own life. Mum was devastated. The funeral was conducted in the afternoon. The lady celebrant, it was done with compassion - a lovely lady. I had chosen He Ain't Heavy, He's My Brother to be played as he was taken out of the chapel. His brothers, his male cousins and close mates filled in the grave. Everyone was invited back for afternoon tea and a slideshow of Geoff in his younger days as a teenager. It was probably a week later when I was back in the city, I was about to go to bed. Mum was ringing a lot. She was still distraught. And I was trying to help her in any way I could. One night, I was so exhausted and emotionally drained, I went to bed. I turned the light off, I heard this distinct sob. I just froze - 'Oh, my God. It's Geoff.' He's sorry that this thing has happened. I decided I wouldn't tell Mum 'cause she was still too upset. This went on for some weeks. Not consistently - it was every couple of nights. Sometimes I wouldn't hear it for four or five nights. Then I'd hear it again. I wasn't afraid, but I found it so distressing to hear the sadness - the sadness of his sob. I hopped into bed and turned the light off. And I heard the sob again. I laid there and I shed a few tears and I said, 'Geoff. It's OK, matey. It's OK. Grandmother and Grandfather will be there with you. They'll look after you. And it's OK, Geoff. It's OK to move on.' I turned the radio on. I heard this music, and I thought, 'I know this music.' And I heard it. It was He Ain't Heavy... He's My Brother. I knew then that that was him. I just thought, 'Be free, Geoff. Whatever happened, be free.' I've never heard it since then. About my experience - it was '96, '96 - and I was on... Thursday Island at the time. I was eight months pregnant. I was staying at my cousin sister's house on TI - on Thursday Island and, um... it was night-time in the room. Now, I'd made my bed on the floor. I'd taken the mattress, placed it on the floor and, I was sleeping on the floor. It was comfortable for me to sleep on the floor at the time, but my husband was sleeping on the bed. So just as I was falling asleep, as I was dozing off, I, uh... I could feel a hand on my face, on the side of my face. It was pushing me down into the pillow. You know? It was just pushing me down. And I, uh... I couldn't move. You know, I... I... I was struggling. I couldn't move at all. I was just stiff, you know? I was stiff. And I tried to move my fingers, but I couldn't move. I was completely stiff. It was like all the energy had come out of you? Yeah. It was like I was paralysed and I couldn't move, you know. And this thing was just pushing my head deeper and deeper into the pillow. And I felt like I was getting pushed into this big hole, you know. And it kept pushing. But, you know... and I'm a Christian, you know. I believe in God. And I just... I said to this thing, you know, 'I rebuke you in Jesus' name.' And it came off me. And I sat up and my heart was beating so fast, like, I was so scared. And I was just sitting there trying to catch my breath and I turned and I said to my husband who was sleeping on the bed, you know, 'Come down here and sleep with me on the mattress. Like, something was... it was trying to suffocate me.' Into the pillow, eh? Well, I told him, 'Come down and sleep on the mattress with me. Something was trying to suffocate me, like, spiritually.' You know? - Mm-hm. - It was trying to suffocate me. And he came down off the bed and he made his bed, he slept next to me on the mattress. And, you know, he had dozed off, he went to sleep. But I couldn't go to sleep because I was still afraid, I was still scared. So I just laid there, you know, for a while, and then I could feel myself, like, dozing off. I could feel myself, like, starting to fall asleep again, you know? And then it happened again. You know, this hand on the side of my face, pushing me. And it all happened so quickly, like, just pushing me into my pillow. And I... it felt like I was going into this deep, dark hole. You know, this hand was pushing me into this deep, dark hole. And then I woke up and I was floating above myself, you know. I looked down, there was my husband and there was I - we were both sleeping on the mattress, but here I was. - So I was out of my body. - Mm-hm. I was floating above the bed. And I looked around the room and I looked into the corner and there was this black woman - a woman was crouching in the corner. And, you know, she had... her skin was all folded over, you know, like, folded and wrinkly, like, um... - You know those dogs? - Yeah, the... You know, dogs with the folded skin? Oh, what's the...? I can't remember. You know what dog I'm talking about, eh. I don't know the name of that particular dog, but you know what dog I'm talking about. Well, that dog, the one with the folded skin, that's what her skin looked like, you know? You know, and getting back to that woman, she had folded skin and she was just sitting there, staring at me. And as soon as I saw her, I was afraid, but I knew that God was on my side, you know, 'cause I'm a Christian. And I said to that woman, or that thing, in the corner, you know, 'I rebuke you in Jesus' name!' You know? And that... that woman, it stood up, but it had no legs. It stood up on its arms, like this. You know? And I said to it again, you know, 'I rebuke you in Jesus' name!' And it started crawling along the walls. You know? Crawling along the walls, like this. And it was crawling, and I was floating and I was looking and I was saying, 'I see you and I rebuke you in Jesus' name. I rebuke you in Jesus' name.' You know? And it... it was crawling along and it was, like, looking at me, and looking like this and crawling along the wall. Moving with its hands? Moving with its hands. You know, it didn't have any legs, this thing. Just moving across the wall. It had red eyes glaring at me, you know. And when I said 'I rebuke you in Jesus' name', you know, 'cause God has more power over the creature, and this thing, it just basmout. Like, it turned to ash. - Ash? - To Ash. You know, turned to ash and, like smoke, it just went underneath the door, underneath the door. It went underneath and it went outside. Because I worship the Creator, not the creature. My God is more powerful. Well, thank you. Thank you for telling your story. It's beautiful. Au eswou. This story I'm gonna tell happened about 11 and a half years ago. We were travelling... travelling from Alice to Adelaide. We got about 100k's out of Coober Pedy and it was very late. And we're travelling and I was looking forward to getting to Coober Pedy to have a stretch and a drink. And so we got about... probably about 80k's out of Coober Pedy, and we're driving along and I'm just looking to the side of the road - Mark's driving, all the kids are in the back - and I spotted this young girl. I reckon she would've been about 11 years old. So from where the road is, she would've been probably about 100m along the fence line. And this young girl was, sort of, she was walking along the fence line. And for a stage, I could see her whole body - her legs - she had long legs and long arms and a fragile body and she had a white dress on. I just was looking at her, then I thought, 'I wonder what that girl's doing walking along the fence line. It's gonna be nightfall in an hour.' Anyway, it was just a thought at that stage. And I just watched her and she just kept walking along the fence line. So I said to Marky, I said, 'Did you see that girl walking along the fence?' And he said, 'What girl?' I said, 'There was a young girl there. About 11 years old.' And I said, 'What do you reckon she's doing walking along the fence line? There must be an Aboriginal community close by.' It just really bugged me and I said, 'Oh. You know, it's gonna be dark soon. We should turn around and go back and just check on her 'cause she might be, you know, walking into town and she's got a long way to go.' You know, like, by this stage, I think we were around 30k's out of Coober Pedy. So he sort of said, 'OK, then, let's go back and have a look.' We drove along really slowly. And sort of at the stage where I thought I'd last seen her, we got to that stage, and I said, 'Oh, she should be round here somewhere.' So we had all eyes looking for her - everybody in the car... looking for her. Anyway, we couldn't see her and I said, 'Look, we must've passed her.' And Marky said, 'Oh, well, never mind, we'll drive up a bit further.' So we probably travelled another 15k's up the road, there was no sign of her. And I sort of gave up then, gave up hope of seeing her again. And I sort of, in my mind, had come to the decision that young girl must have lived there somewhere or she was walking along the line and she was meeting somebody, and that sort of thing. Anyway, so I said to Marky, 'Nup. This is too far. She's not there.' So we turned around and started coming back, and, you know, like, he just travelled slowly, and by this time, it was really coming in to dusk. So we're travelling along and everybody's still sort of keeping an eye out, so we got back around the place where I thought I'd seen that little girl, the last sighting I had of her. And all of a sudden, there was a little child walking along the side of the road. And everyone sort of said, 'Oh. Look there! There's a kid there! There's a kid there!' So we pulled up. Anyway, it was a little boy. So we jumped out of the car and, 'Hello! Are you alright?' And he said, 'No. Mum left me behind.' And I said, 'Oh, what? Where's Mum?' And he said, 'Oh, we went... we went hunting and on the way out hunting...' They were going to look for some witchetty grubs. 'On the way out, I'd fallen to sleep.' And he was probably about seven years old. 'And I'd fallen to sleep on the way out and my mob went hunting and I was asleep in the car. When I woke up, they weren't in the car, so I got out to go to the toilet and look for them. And I couldn't find them. And so... I walked back to the car and the car was gone. My mob had left me behind. They must have forgot about me.' And we said, 'OK, no worries. What's your name?' And he told us his name was Ringo. 'OK, Ringo, don't worry. We'll take you home. Where do you live?' 'In the community at Coober Pedy.' 'That's alright, Ringo. We'll take you home.' So we put Ringo in the car, asked him if he wanted a drink and gave him a drink, asked him if he wanted anything. He really didn't want anything. And his little eyes were, you know, a bit frightened and whatever else. So by this time, it had turned to full dark now. And so we've got Ringo in the car, and as we come up, we could see the headlights of a big truck and we could see these two women, one standing on the road, and as she spotted us, she sort of put her hands out and 'Stop!' And another woman was talking to the truck driver and had the passenger door open and I said, 'Ah, Ringo, this must be your family looking for you.' He said, 'Yeah, that's my nana and my mum there.' You know, and I had this big sense of relief that, you know, Ringo was gonna be reunited with his family and they were looking for him and that sort of thing. And as I walked up to them, this old lady came to me. And I said, 'Are you looking for Ringo?' And I said, 'We got Ringo there.' And she just started crying, eh. And so she was crying and she grabbed me and then his mother come over and so Ringo has come out of the car and they're that happy. 'Oh, Ringo!' You know? So it was a lovely sort of reunion. And I was like, so I said to that old woman, I said, you know, I said, 'I was looking for a little girl. Was there a little girl with Ringo?' She reckoned, 'No, that was his spirit. That's his little spirit.' You know, totally disregarded, like, all my concerns that there was a... that I'd seen this little girl and then I'd found this little boy. And they just said, 'No, that was his little spirit. She's looking after him.' And so that's a little story, anyway. I always still feel there's a little girl lost out there somewhere, walking them lines, the fence line. Beautiful little black girl. And that feeling has stayed with me. You know, it's like there's still this beautiful little girl there - a little spirit. A little protective spirit. ♪ Help, I have done it again ♪ I have been here many times before ♪ Oh, oh ♪ Hurt myself again today ♪ And the worst part is there's no-one else to blame ♪ Be my friend ♪ Hold me ♪ Wrap me up ♪ Unfold me ♪ I am small ♪ I'm needy ♪ Warm me up ♪ And breathe me. ♪ So, Kim, thank you for doing this interview. Thanks. Um, I guess just start at the start, please. Um... yeah. Well, I went over to stay with my brother-in-law and his family over in South Australia. And his, um... For a holiday. And his family are the original white people who've come down from Adelaide, who settled in the area. And, um... yeah, they were mostly, you know, sheep farmers, but his family were fishermen. And they settled there. They call it settling. And, um... yeah, well, I kept asking my brother-in-law and my sister... Actually, I was kind of annoying them 'cause I kept asking them who lived here before they settled there. And they were like, 'No, no-one. No, no-one was here.' And I didn't feel like that was right because I thought there'd probably been massacres on the Yorke Peninsula and that because it's just, you know, it's like everywhere else in Australia. Yep. 'Cause I had a feeling, you know, that something had happened in the family's past, you know, what with claiming the land... that they lived on. - I don't think they paid for it. - Yeah. So, um, yeah, so he said it was just a matter of they came there and they settled there, you know. It just didn't feel right. So yeah, so one night, I went out late, you know, to go to the toilet 'cause the toilet was outside. And it was July, it was freezing cold, you know. It was a beautiful night. 'Cause it had been windy and cloudy and that and everything, but just for a minute, it actually just - I remember it - it actually just sort of cleared up. And it was really, really cold and I was just standing there looking at the sky. 'Cause they have these amazing skies down there, you know, and ocean and that, because they're right there on the beach. Wow. And all of a sudden... all of these people started to appear right in front of me. And, you know, they wouldn't have been very far - they would've been about from here to, say, that rock over there, so probably not far, probably about 20ft. And there would've been about a hundred or so. And I didn't count them or anything, but there was this main man, front and centre, and he had on these beautiful hat and boots and skins. I wasn't scared or anything. It was more like, 'Oh, there you are.' You know? 'I knew you were there and, you know, thank you. You know, thank you for showing me.' - You know. - Yeah. Yeah, and, you know, who was there before. Yeah. 'Cause I was like, 'Oh, there you are. 'Cause I knew youse were there.' And, you know, it was like... it was really, really cold, but they were all really cosy, because they had these beautiful, really striking outfits. You know, like these beautiful hats and boots and cloaks and everything so warm. Mainly the women and children, everyone, so warm. And, you know, they were just like, I remember, they were really... they looked really, really beautiful. You know, like, really beautiful and healthy and, you know, they looked good, but, you know, there was a sadness there that I could feel. 'Cause, you know, even when I was looking at them, I was thinking that something had happened to them. You know? So, yeah. And that main fellow who was in the front, he had sort of black, sort of wiry hair, sort of longish and a big black beard. And he was, you know, he was a good-looking fellow. He was probably in about his 40s maybe. And there was this woman who was near him, about the same age. You know, older man. And there was some other women and some men, but not many men. You know, and there was some boys and girls and they were more or less to the side of him and just behind him a bit, you know. And... they sort of come up and they sort of appeared and they sort of stayed there for a while and then they just faded out. Which is, um... how I sort of experience it when I see ghosts. They all seem to do that. I don't know what that's about. It wasn't, like... It was like, you know... 'cause it was like I was fully awake. I mean, I wasn't sleepwalking or anything. And they were there. And I had this sense that this was their country and that I was standing on their country. And you wanted to know, eh? Yeah, and I wanted to know, because whenever white people try and deny things to me or try and act like things that I know to be true aren't, the more curious I get, you know. And... you know, they made me very curious, my brother-in-law and my sister, when they were saying, 'Oh, no, no-one was here. No-one was here.' And I was like, 'No-one? How could there not be anyone?' It was like, 'No, no-one was here. They would've all took off.' And, you know, from what people have told me, the ancestors probably chose to show themselves to me 'cause I was so curious. You know, and I'm just lucky that they showed me, I guess. You know, it was a real honour. Yeah. I'm Kenny Dalton. I'm 72. I was 16 at the time, and my wife Amelia and me, we were travelling up to Beerwah, from Beerwah to Bundaberg. And I was, um... I was working, cane-cutting at Childers for a while there. And we were staying in this shed. It was a big shed. And the shed faced eastward. And just outside the shed was this hill. It went up pretty high. And Amelia and I, we were just laying there and we were looking. And on top of the hill, I saw this light. It was like, them glow-worms? What do you call them? - Fireflies, eh? - Fireflies. Yeah, yeah. And it was coming down the hill, this light. It was a bluey sort of light. And it came down the hill, stopped, just out the front where we was. And it turned around and it went back up. I said to Amelia, 'There's something wrong here.' So, inquisitiveness... I went up. And here on top of the hill was this house. It had been burnt. Burnt to the ground. But out the front was all these flowers. They was in full bloom. When I went to work, I told the people, 'Where we're staying on top of that hill, there's a house.' And this fella said, 'Yeah. It got burnt down. The people that were there - a husband, his wife and their child - they were burnt. Burnt to death.' Because back in '55, '56... Well, it happened in '52, they perished. But there was no fire brigade and things like we got today. So when I came home that night, again, that light come down the hill. They said this woman, she was a keen gardener. She put in all the gardens. And, um... she were mad keen for gardening. She was only young - about 20 - when she died. Well, when I came home, I said to my wife, 'Did you get them flowers from up at the top of the hill?' And she said, 'Yes.' I said, 'We better take them flowers back up.' So I took the flowers and I went back up. And I was just standing there. There was nobody else around. And I said, 'I'm sorry. My wife didn't know what she was doing.' And I put the flowers back. And we never seen that light no more. 'Cause I believe, I believe that when we die, our body goes into the ground, our soul goes to meet with our Creator and our spirits remain. Our spirits remain. And I believe that spirit is still around that house, 'cause that woman didn't like us taking her flowers. Yeah... Well, we decided to take the rubbish to the tip, 'cause in a country town, the tip to Aboriginal people is like... treasure. A lot of good things, you know? So we're down there just walking around and I just go for a stickybeak - it's just what I used to do when I was little. And I seen this square board upside down on the ground. And I thought it was a placemat for the table. And I'm thinking, 'Oh, yeah, looks good, brand-new, good condition.' So I flip it over. Ouija board. So I jump back. So you knew what it was? Oh, yeah, I knew what it was. I jumped back, wouldn't touch it. And then I went to my sister-in-law and said, 'There's a ouija board over here.' She goes, 'Where, where, where?' I go, 'No, no, no. Don't touch it. 'Cause it's bad luck. You're not allowed to touch it.' She goes, 'Nah, I don't believe in that.' So she calls her mum, she comes over, and they pick it up, and I told the mother and daughter not to pick it up and take it home. But the son comes over, he picks it up, throws it in the boot and says, 'I'll take it home.' I wouldn't walk in that car. I wouldn't get in that car. Wouldn't get in there. I walked from the tip back home. Like, it wasn't far. And the next day... No... Yeah, no, that night, they decided to play the board. And the board goes... They asked the board questions, you know, 'So and so and so.' And the board turns around and it goes, 'I'll get you for...' 'Cause I walked out of the room and when I came back, all I caught was, 'I'll get you for that.' Who... Who said that? The... The board. It, like, spelt it out or...? Yeah, yeah. No, it spelt it out. And my sister-in-law, she goes, 'Get who? Who are you gonna get and what's gonna happen?' And he goes 'you' to her. Goes, 'You. You'll never have a boy. Every son you have, I'll take.' She's now had eight girls. But, um... that's part of the board, too - wishes - or whatever it cast on them. And Tee-Boy, it said, 'I'll get you. I'll get someone dearly to you, you and your missus.' It took Tee-Boy. He died after that. And the eldest brother, he goes, 'I'm gonna take someone you love dearly.' Took his wife. And 'cause I was in the room, it took my daughter. Mm-hm. And the youngest brother who picked the board up, it said, 'I'm gonna get someone dearly to you.' Took the mother. So the whole family is, like, lost, it's gone. One's schizophrenic... Two's schizophrenic. One's full alcoholic. One lost the plot. One sister died. Dropped dead, young age, 32, I think. 34... 32. And the other sister, she lost her mind. The dad, things are happening to him, 'cause it keeps carrying on. And my sister-in-law's daughter, it attacks her. 'Cause they didn't get rid of the curse from the ouija board - 'cause they didn't know how to do it. So now it still follows the family. Yeah. Back in about 1999, I was at an outstation... that belongs to my family and I read about it in the paper. My old grandfather and one of my relations... relatives, we went back out bush to sit down. But I had been reading about the eclipse during the weekend, while I was in Tennant Creek. And I was explaining to my old grandfather - he would've been about 80-odd then - explaining to him what was gonna... happen on this Tuesday. And, uh... And my other brother's standing up there, 'Yeah, that's what's gonna happen'. It was the eclipse of the sun where the moon comes in the middle of... between the sun and the planet. Yeah, so, I told the old fella, that it's gonna happen today.' And, anyway, I'm waiting for it to come around lunchtime. I'm just waiting for it all day. And, uh... There now. I said, 'There, look Apurlye, it's coming. It's just starting. Eh? Eh!' And he's looking at it, 'What's going on here?' And he started getting really uncomfortable, like, tying his swag up and going and hiding his head down under his arm and having quick peeps, you know, and me and my brother there ripping ourselves laughing because we knew what was going on but we were just laughing at this old lawman, Aboriginal lawman, culture man. And he's wondering, what's going on with this planet? This is something that's gonna... Something bad's happening around the country. You know? Someone's destroyed a sacred site or someone's ill, some mythological thing that belonging to the creations sort of thing was coming. It was funny, eh? Oh. Talk about a laugh. So then it all finished, then it was really bright again. So I had to explain what happened and draw a couple of pictures in the sand of what happened. And, uh, to an old 80-year-old tribal man, even the pictures couldn't explain to him what happened with the solar system that day. You know, I think it only comes round once a blue moon and it was a good time to witness it, out bush, where it's all clear, you know? In 2009, I went to the National Film Sound Archive as a research fellow. And I was being housed next door to the National Film Sound Archive - NFSA building. Mm-hm. In a building that I found out was previously the house of Sir Colin MacKenzie. Sir Colin MacKenzie used to be the head of the Institute of Anatomy, which was once housed in the same building where the NFSA is now housed. - And this is Canberra, yeah? - And this is all in Canberra. I got to learn a bit more about Sir Colin MacKenzie, this man who I realised would have been involved in and oversaw the anatomical dissection of Indigenous peoples as specimens, as scientific specimens. Mm-hm. It became intriguing to me that the parallel between the National Film Sound Archive being housed in the very same building as the Institute of Anatomy, the place that would have housed our remains, the remains of Indigenous peoples, now housed the representation of us. So that was the first intriguing correlation for me. Then, more and more, I felt like I was being watched - first by the portrait. Studied, almost. Studied. That's right. For the majority of my research, I was living alone. For a good two and a half months, I was in this house alone with the presence of Colin MacKenzie. About four weeks into it, I remember laying down in my bedroom. Each night, I was terrified to go to sleep. It had built up so much, the energy around the nature of Colin MacKenzie and his work. And I was dozing in and out of sleep. I saw this man walking towards me and he just got closer and closer, totally in silhouette, and he walked into my room. And in his right hand he was carrying a scalpel. And he raised his hand and he sliced the scalpel through my body. And I remember the pain of feeling the scalpel passing through my body, and I woke up. It was such a violent swing of the scalpel that made me wake up. I jolted awake. From that moment on, my research that I was originally there to do changed. I was now more and more interested in what happened to the remains of our people. I was increasingly drawn into the nature of anatomical research. And I was shown the morgue, which is on the lower level of the building, where bodies were kept. There is one single photograph in that building now that shows all the skeletal remains. That is now the permanent exhibition of film - the history of film in Australia - once housed all the skeletal remains of animals, people, the theory of evolution, et cetera. That's an interesting point because we're talking back in the days when they were still looking for the missing link, and they thought that Indigenous people could be or would have a close connection to this so-called missing link, isn't it? That's right. That's right. And all of the ethnographic work I was looking at, which is the anthropometric work, you know, the measurement, the archival footage of people standing up and sitting down - all of this correlated to a physical examination... - Yeah, yeah. - ..beyond film. So this was an intriguing relationship to me. And I ended up... I became obsessed with finding out what happened to us in that building. I became more and more aware of spiritual unrest, um... people not being returned to country. I ended up going to talk to David Kaus at the National Museum of Australia who now is in charge of the yet-to-be-repatriated remains of Indigenous peoples. His office sits outside about two or three shipping containers full of Indigenous peoples' remains that have yet to be repatriated. David Kaus himself was involved in the physical transference from the Institute of Anatomy into the National Museum of Australia, into those containers, where they now sit. - To me, their voices are really clear. - Mm-hm. To me, the voices of those people are really clear and that is... Um... You know, it is - it's searching for connection. You know. - They've gotta be returned home. - Yeah. So what was actually really quite a dry research topic... which was looking at the Indigenous cultural intellectual property and filmmaking, by examining the ethnographic works held in the National Film Sound Archive ended up becoming... about... the rights of... the dead undead... Mm-hm. The still-living spirits of our people, who have yet to be treated right. For a lot of reasons, they're not repatriated, not knowing where they're from, those kind of things. But it was then that this man, this awful, awful thing of having a scalpel cut through my body, being jarred awake by Colin MacKenzie, actually, led me on this path to the very people he probably would have once examined, to hear their voice, and really to work harder in taking them home. So, Graham, thanks for telling us your story. Pleasure. I suppose, just start at the beginning. Yeah, alright. Well, when this happened, we were living in Gove. Our house had been pretty badly damaged in Cyclone Tracy and so we'd been relocated to Gove and I actually had a project going on there already. I was pollution monitoring at the factory there and so I was pretty well occupied but I had a bit of spare time and I was pretty interested in what was going on around the countryside and that. The thing that was really big at the time, and this is the background to the whole story, is that, in the '70s, the thing that was big with the aquarium people were these fish called rainbows, and the Germans were really into them because they were line-breeding stuff, make fancy designs of fish. Anyway, there'd been some collecting trips done and there was a fishing inspector there who had a place that he wanted to visit and he said to me would I like to come with him and we go looking for these little things, these little fishies. So I was like, 'Yeah!' You know? 'I'm there, for sure.' So the idea was that we'd spend the first night on the Cato - that was a place I hadn't been to, a place he hadn't been to. So we took off and we kept going until we came to a billabong on the Cato and this was, you know, this was a beautiful site, this was lovely, it was magnificent. So the idea was we'd spend the night there. We'd left in the afternoon, it wasn't dark, so we said, 'Why don't we just put the dinghy in?' So it was a steep bank, so we had to rope the dinghy down, and I didn't have any strange feeling here but Col said to me afterwards that he had felt a bit strange here. So we went out, put all our gear in, we went out in the dinghy and we were looking for an area where there'd be some rainbows - there was obviously going to be rainbows there. And upstream, it started to break up into little islands but they couldn't have been islands, I looked at aerial pictures later and they weren't islands, but there were channels. There was no way, or it would've... I don't know how anyone could've got to the other bank. I mean, you would've had to go a long, long way up to get to the other bank. And we were going up this channel and we threw out a line because we knew there'd be barras there, and then, all of a sudden, and this was sort of strange, the river, the stream, that was about five or six metres wide, suddenly widened and there was an indentation in the right bank of about three metres or so, and it came to a point. And sitting on the point was a girl. And she was sitting there with her legs tucked up into the point - it was an Aboriginal girl, she was probably, I don't know... She was a young girl, 16, 18 years old, conventionally pretty. But the thing that really got me was that she was in a dress and the dress was very, very clean. Now, if you've driven through that country and no utes or Land Rovers in those days had any air-conditioning, you'd have just had the windows open and dust would've been coming in the windows and I mean, even if she bought that dress at the mission in Karla and popped in the car and came straight over here, she'd be dirty, I mean, we were all dirty. Yeah, yeah. But she was clean. I remember it was a pale blue dress and it had these floral designs - these flower designs were in at the time - yellow with black rings and white with black rings. She was just sitting there and she was, like, clean! And... You know... then we looked out, we kept going towards her and we looked out to the right about 45 degrees, and beyond her, maybe 50, 70m, there was a lean-to. Two trees, one with a fork low down, a piece of timber across, wired with fencing wire, and a covering just there, not rusty. It was... it looked fairly new, corrugated iron, and all around there was like the other place, like it had been swept and it was all clean. Wow. And anyway, suddenly, it was a barra, I thought it was a barra, but Col said it was a saratoga, started jumping and that distracted me. I turned around, went, 'There, let's get this! Let's get it in.' Then it threw the lure and I turned around, and when I looked to the point, there was no girl. There was no lean-to. There was nothing. And the grass that she was sitting on... there was no suggestion that anybody was sitting on it. She just wasn't there anymore. And I said to Col, 'Did you see that?' And he said, he muttered something, I don't know what he said. But she wasn't there. I did hear later on that an Aboriginal woman had been taken by a croc downstream but that was, like, you know, months afterwards. All that was there was they found a piece of tin. The crocs like chewing on tin - they like the texture of it. But, you know, I don't think it's got anything to do with it. So it just completely disappeared. The whole scenario... the whole... everything. It was all current. It was all... And it was just like everything was clean... and then they weren't there. - Did she look at you or...? - Yeah, yeah. She looked at us but she sort of... It was like she was looking through us. Yeah. - And... yeah. - Wow. She was real, real... She was real. I think. There was about 20, 25 people there - men and women - and we were introduced to these people that were going to take us through the meditation, so it was this guy - a didge player - they said we were really in for a treat 'cause he was quite a famous, well known didge player. I don't know his name, I've got it written down somewhere, but he was going to play for us. And his girlfriend, who was an Aboriginal lady, and she looked very fantastic and authentic with the painted arms and bare midriff, not exposed or anything, just bare midriff, and she was covered in, like, bark or paperbark. Stuff like that. OK, sort of traditional? - Yeah, yeah, like traditional garb. - Mm-hm. And, um... and he had this massive didge, like, not just one of those smaller ones, it was a really big didge. So she explained that we should lie down in a circle on our yoga mats and, um, go through the process of relaxation, take a few deep breaths and she warned us that we were going to smell smoke. So, um... we were lying down and he's in the centre playing the didge up and down our bodies. So you could feel this, like, waves of vibrations coming off the sound of the didge and she was chanting and you could smell the crackle of the eucalyptus leaves and smell the smoke. It was really like, um... just all your five senses were heightened and it was like... I felt myself being transported somewhere. Like I kind of... Like my body was there but I was leaving my body. It was really... an incredible feeling. I started seeing out to the left of me this kind of holographic image and I couldn't quite work out what it was. I mean, intuitively, I could see it because I had the eye bags on so it was in my mind. And, yeah, I just felt like... you know, things were... I was being transported somewhere and I was losing my current... going to a different consciousness. It was an incredible feeling. Ah, I love this song. So I could see this Aboriginal elder standing there like a holographic image, and he was talking to me, like, I couldn't understand what he was saying 'cause he was speaking in, yeah, an Aboriginal dialect. And I was saying, 'I don't understand what you're trying to tell me!'. And then he was kind of getting louder and louder and I don't do drugs but it was like, I don't know, it felt like what it would be like to be on drugs - it was really dizzy and I was feeling really spacey and he was talking to me. And then I looked down and I thought... hang on, there is a massive rainbow serpent snake coming up from under my foot and it's winding its way up my body really purposefully and I can see its, like, eyes looking right at me and I can see its little fangs and its tongue flicking in and out and I am just like... I couldn't feel my body and I couldn't move and I'm just thinking, 'I'm going to die. Am I going to get squashed?' And it was moving its way up my body purposefully and the Aboriginal gentleman just kept singing and talking and trying to tell me something. And then the snake, just as it got close to my face, did this... this magnificent movement where it just flicked its body around so that its head was resting on my throat. Just like if you were looking at me, you would see the snake looking at you. It was a beautiful feeling. It was like he was protecting me, like, it was a comforting feeling and I thought, 'Oh, right, you're not here to hurt me!' And all the fear and the anxiety just dissipated. The Aboriginal elder, like, he was far away on the other side of the room and then, suddenly, pow, you know, bang! He was right there, his face right in front of me. And then the room started spinning again and suddenly we just landed in this place. It was night-time and it was red and barren and I think, maybe, I was, like, near Ayers Rock. And there were all these Aboriginal men dancing in a clockwise motion around a big campfire and I was thinking, 'Wow, I shouldn't be here.' I was the only woman there and I know that this is maybe sacred men's business and why am I here? Why am I being shown this? And the Aboriginal man came right up to me and he was talking really loudly, like, the sounds were coming from everywhere and he had this white paint. He put some dots on my temples and dots right under my eyes. I just felt really... honoured, like I was being... accepted. I just felt very, very honoured. Yeah, and then he just started to fade away. Yeah. Anyway, at that point, I just kind of felt this convulsion and I landed, like, bang, back in my body, back in the North Shore lady's house. There was no didge playing, there was... no smoke, the meditation was over. I woke up and sat up, and I said, 'Wow, that was really trippy!' And the Aboriginal lady was there and I said... 'I just had the most amazing experience.' And she said, 'Yeah, I know. You saw my grandfather.' Mm. And I said, 'Yeah, how did you know? Did you see the spiders as well?' She said, 'Yeah, yeah, yeah, I saw the spiders but more importantly, you saw my grandfather, and that's never happened before - he's never appeared to a white person before, let alone a woman.' And, um... I get a bit emotional when I talk about it but she said that the reason why he would've... I would've experienced that was because I have... because I'm open. Like, I've got the heart of a child. And that the rainbow serpent was there to protect me and in the Aboriginal... It means creation and spirit and, um... Yeah. - I just felt really honoured. - Mm. And it just feels like it was some sort of initiation to let me do the work that I do now. Wow, that's amazing. Yeah! Oh, so where do I look, brother? - Look at the camera or I look at you? - No, no, look at me here, yeah. - Look at you? - Yeah, beautiful. Thank you. Yeah, well... Well, we was heading over to Mount Isa. There was Mum, me and David. We left Alice Springs and we were cruising, anyway, and we ended up in Camooweal. Our car broke down, you know. We couldn't get it fixed or anything, so we were kind of stuck there, you know. Anyway, I reckon we must've been going to primary school at the time - me and my brother - we were only kids, you know? Yeah, yeah, that's right. We were going to that school at Camooweal. - You know that school there? - Sort of, yeah. Yeah, yeah, we were going there. Anyway... I reckon we might've been there maybe four weeks, five weeks. Anyway... We were hiring out this big shed, renting it, and it was across the road from that old fuel station there. Oh, yeah, yeah. And that shed, I tell you, man, that was an eerie old shed, you know? Real scary one. That had a dirt floor and it had all these big meat hooks, everything, right down the back. I don't know what was going on there before. Anyway... It had all these old steel shutters. You know, like them ones you've got to prop open with an iron bar - you know, the little iron bar? Prop them open. Anyway, you got to use a bit of force to prop 'em open. They're not easy to open up. Anyway, we were staying there and that big shed we were in, it didn't have any lockable doors either, you know. We used to have to prop up them big... - Cyclone beds. You know them ones? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, they're heavy - them ones. They stand the test of time, I'll tell you, man. Anyway, we had to prop it up just to close that main door. Anyway, look, there was two sheds there. There was a little basic small shed there, too, and it was same as that one - it had no facilities, no power - but there was an old woman staying there. Old woman. - One old family member. - Aboriginal one? Yeah, old woman, old Aboriginal woman. She used to live there with her husband. She actually lived there. We were only renting. Yeah. Anyway, a couple of days before the incident, the dog that we had that was there, he was doing all these strange things, you know? - Like barking up this tree. - Yeah. And it was only a small tree 'cause it was right next door to that old shed. You know, right next door to it. Right along the side there, anyway. And he's barking up this tree and he's trying to run up the tree, and he's falling off and we're thinking, 'What's going on with this dog?' It was weird, man, really weird. Anyway, Mum saw that and she said, 'Eh, something happened.' - Like... like, something bad, you know? - Yeah. Like maybe someone passed on or something like that. - Like an omen? - Yeah! Yeah. Yeah, it was scary. Anyway, my uncle noticed that, too, and he said, 'That's real weird.' He thought something bad happened, too, 'cause dogs don't normally act like that, you know. Up trees, barking? Yeah, he's barking up a tree. There's nothing up there! You could see it, it was only a little tree. - Well, not that little, but you know. - Yeah. Yeah. Anyway, couple of days later, Mum... me and David, we went into town, 'cause the butchers were having a barbecue, you know. So we went in there to have a feed and it was a good feed. And then it was getting late so we all decided to walk back, you know, to where we were staying in that big shed. And it was a beautiful night, like, a bit like now - you know, the moon was lit, you could see where you were going, it was real quiet, a calm night, beautiful night. Anyway, we got back to our shed and there was family there camping outside, a family that had come up a couple of days before, 'cause they'd come up in a troopie, about six or seven of them, and they were all camping in swags. Anyways, we all said, 'Goodnight!' Then we went inside and put up that cyclone bed up against the main door just to close it, you know, and we all went to sleep, lying down there. And I don't know how long we were asleep for but all of a sudden, this noise started. Like, them shutters, they started to slowly rattle... little bit. No, bruz? Yeah, like, intermittently. You know, like, not at the same time, different times. Anyway... it was getting a little bit louder, more abrupt, like, aggressive, you know? - Yeah, yeah. - Like, angry. And we woke up. I mean, I didn't get out of bed, none of us did. We didn't know what was going on. You know, it was pitch black - we couldn't see anything. - There was no wind or anything? - No, there was no wind! - Nothing! Still, like tonight. - Yeah. Like that. It was a good night. Anyway, the shutters started, uh... just kind of be slammed together, like someone... duh-duh-duh-duh... knocking them together, you know? And then, next minute, that thing - whatever it was - it started on that door, then, pushing at that door. You could see that cyclone bed... well, not see it but you could hear it. Hear that cyclone bed moving. Then all of a sudden, he pushed that door open and that cyclone bed went flying! - Boom! - Yeah. And then you could hear this noise, he come in, like, 'Argh...' He breathing, you know, like groaning and moaning, you know? Carrying on, brother. Carrying on. And anyway... I didn't know what it was 'cause it was right up in your face, too, you could feel it here like this. - It was in your face! - Yeah. Like angry at you. Anyway... - What, man? - You hear that? Nuh. I thought I heard something. I can't hear it. Bruz, we're still rolling. You going to sit down? What's that? Oh, I thought I heard something, brother. Anyway, we, um... We jumped up out of bed, well, me and Mum did, but my brother David, he couldn't move. He was, like, like, petrified. - Unna. - Yeah. Yeah! - Stiff as a board. - Yeah? Yeah, yeah, he didn't move. Anyway... - From fright, eh, or...? - Oh, he was shitting himself. - Yeah. - Yeah, yeah. But we all was. - And it was still in there? - Yeah, it was still in there! You could feel it, brother. Yeah. It was real bad energy. Anyway, Mum picked him up and carried him outside and he was stiff while she was carrying him, too, you know, like, he didn't move - he was like that. And we got him out and when we got him out, you know, everything seemed to kind of just change. Like... it went quiet. I don't know how it happened that quick. - So was it still inside? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Or had it moved? It disappeared or something? It just disappeared. But it was really like... Well, we found out... 'cause we asked everybody afterwards, we said, you know, 'Who used to live there?' And they said that there was an old whitefella, old cattle drover used to live there - a skinny fella with a hat. He used to live there. - He was a bit of a racist. - Mm. - Yeah, he didn't like blackfellas. - Mm. So I reckon he was angry that we were there, eh. - Yeah. - I reckon... Old mongrel. Yeah, and you know what that old woman said to us afterwards? She said, 'Ah, don't worry about him! He's always pushing me around. He's always choking me, always picking on me. But he's alright.' The ghost was always choking her and picking on her and he's alright? That's what she said! Yeah. Anyway, a couple of days later, we gone, bruz, we took off. How was that? Was that alright? - That was deadly. - I don't know. Thank you for telling me your story, Steven. - That's alright. I think I got it all. - Ma. When I was around about 28 years of age, I lived just around the corner from where I'm living now at O'Sullivan's Beach and, um... A friend of mine rang me up and wanted me to come over and see her. I started driving over there and, um... I think, with this story, like, I was stoned. I was actually stoned and cruising from there to my mate's house and on my way to my mate's house, I just... The whole car just went really cold... and I just felt really in an anxiety sort of space. I don't know. All of a sudden, I just, like, looked in the rear vision of the mirror and she showed herself. And I just started freaking out 'cause I'm thinking, 'I'm stoned! This is bullshit! I'm hallucinating! Like, this isn't something... This is crap!' You know? So, I pulled into a friend's house halfway through, um... 'cause I was freaking out... and I just stayed there and I just told her what I had witnessed. I was like, 'Nah, it's probably 'cause I'm stoned.' She was like, 'These things happen when you're stoned and when you're not stoned, ' and things like that. And, um... I sat there for a good couple of hours until I was right, until I was straight and stuff and then I jumped back in the car and I went to drive off to the other person's house and she revealed herself again. I was like, 'What the hell's going on? Is this real? What the hell?' And she, um... Nana just turned around and said, you know, 'You don't need to be doing this, ' 'cause, like, I was on a really bad road. So she said to me, you know, 'I'm always here for you.' 'Cause when she was gone, it was really... really hard to deal with my life, because she was my rock and my foundation. And... she was always there to help me sort things out with my parents and stuff like that. So, um... so within that moment, it was just like, 'I'm always here for you. If you ever need me and you need a... All you need to do is ask and I'll support you. And sometimes you'll see me and sometimes you won't.' So that was my road to healing, I guess. That was my door open. It was my way of understanding that they do exist on the other space and, um... I'm never alone and they're always with me. That they actually help me understand death and the greater space. Especially for Aboriginal communities, like loss and grief. Can you tell me about the second encounter, please? Yep. My niece was born at 25 weeks old at Flinders Medical Centre and, yeah, we... We were already told that there was a very small chance that she would survive. And we were very grateful because, you know, she got to a point, Taylah actually got to a point where she was OK, you know? Like, she'd been in intensive care, of course, when she was only 25 weeks old, so she was going to be in there a long time, at least till she hit her 40-week space. And she passed away at three months old in there. They, I... I remember there was a big scare. She was basically breathing on her own. You know, we've got beautiful photos of her in the bath in the hospital and everything like that and we were so happy, you know. We thought, 'Wow, she's going to be OK. She's going to survive.' And then, within a week, she deteriorated, and the doctors said that her lungs, they'd given... every kind of drug they could for her lungs to take effect and, um... I prayed and... of course, asked Nana to be there, like, to help her heal and things like that and, within a week, she was right! So, like... I was like... 'Yes!' You know? This is saying thank you, you know? Um... So she was OK for about three weeks and she started doing really, really well. And the lungs started to work and things. And then after, then she would've been about 2.5 months old by then, and we were really stoked, we really thought she was going to make it. My sister got a phone call saying that she's gone into... respiratory problems and... and that, basically, we're keeping her alive because we can't do anything. We don't understand why this has happened. Again, I prayed and I asked Nana... to help, and... I very strongly said, 'It's time.' That's what I heard. That it was time. And that there was nothing more that they could physically do here and that she would... It's time. And, um... Oh, yeah, I cried and tried to understand it. So, yeah, I kind of knew that it was time, even though I couldn't tell my sister that. I just knew that I had this... um, relationship, spiritually, with Nana and Nana knew that I obviously had been strong enough to be chosen to be able to have this strength to help my family through it. Or had tools, myself, to be strong enough to get through it. So we went to the hospital and we went to see her and I took my daughters to see her and we had photos and everything. Then they were explaining the procedure of palliative care on an infant, where they give her a drug to slowly slip away safely, even though their body's not stressing or anything like that. So all the family came to the hospital and my sister said that she couldn't do it, she couldn't be there overnight - they said they'll probably lose her overnight and my sister, the nurses asked her to stay, and she, um... my sister just broke down and just said she can't do it again. 'Cause she'd already lost her son at six months when she was six months pregnant before. And so she asked me whether I would stay at the hospital that night in case she passed and I said I would. So in the evening, they left and they went home, and I stayed in those little rooms just outside the hospital, just outside where the babies are. And I stayed there with a friend that night. And it would've been about four o'clock in the morning, I swear I heard a big bang on the door, 'cause the nurses said, 'If it's going to happen, then we'll come knock on the door and be prepared to be with her, hold her until she goes.' I heard a big bang and I just fly up and open the door, and there was no-one there. And it was either because my body couldn't sleep because I was prepared for the worst and I just felt like that was just the calling... Nana was trying to prepare me, that it was nearly time and stuff. So then, we were very lucky that it didn't happen that night. But I did fly up and I went in and see what was going on, and they said, 'No, no, there's no change or anything. She's still just... We're just keeping her in that space. In that live space. We'll wait till your sister comes back in the morning and we'll go with it.' So she didn't go then. So my sister and my family all came back - Mum and that came up for the day, and we just sat in the room together, just cuddling her and spending time with her. And they said the palliative care, so that she would be relaxed, they took her off everything and they put her in the room with us. And we were there the whole day, basically, and I had no sleep and we were, of course, stressing and worrying - not knowing when it's going to happen. But we were... We tried to make the most of it and we were singing My Girl, the song My Girl, we were singing that to her. And I felt really, really tired and I went to lay back on the bed and, as I lay down, I just felt, like, something touch me on my face and tell me, 'It's time.' And I thought that, I thought I was hearing things. And I know it was definitely Nana's voice and that's what spins me out because from the moment of prayer and then, you know, within 48 hours that we were in this space. And it was like Nana was saying, 'Right, I'm here, it's five o'clock. I'm here and a quarter past five, she'll pass, and I'll be here to take her.' I told my friend and I said, 'Look, I just heard Nana. Nana's here now.' But I couldn't see her. I could hear her. I watched my mum. My mum was video-taping my sister holding my niece, and they were singing My Girl, singing it over and over... and I just watched the clock. I just watched it count down. It was like the longest 15 minutes of my life, I thought, because I was just watching everyone. Everyone's happy - really, really happy. Yeah, I was just watching the clock and it got closer and closer, and I just heard Nana say to me, 'You need to get up and you need to stand behind your sister.' And I did. And I just watched Mum and my sister, was leaning over my sister behind the chair, I'm sitting like this. And I just watched Taylah. It was a couple of minutes before it hit the 15 mark, and 15 past, and I was back and forth, watching the clock, watching my niece's face. And then it hit and I watched my niece, and I just... It's like a stillness in time. And I just watched my niece open her eyes and just... take a deep breath... close her eyes... and it was right on a quarter past five. And I just heard Nana say, 'Oh, she's OK. I've got her.' And I said to my sister, 'I'm going to get the nurse to come and check on her, because I think she's gone.' So I did and the nurse come back and she checked her heartbeat and she had gone. And then I was into the next space of grief. But it was so happy. And I couldn't tell my family at the time, but I had to tell them later and my sister was grateful, you know. Even though she's not much of a believer... But I just had to say to her, you know, 'You're not alone. She is here, and Taylah's here with you all the time and so is Trey.' And that was basically that story.
