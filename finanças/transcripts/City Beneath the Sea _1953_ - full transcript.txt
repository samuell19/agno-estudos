Well, here we are. How hot can it get? Boy, what a night, eh? Yeah. Hey, I could use a beer. If you don't mind, old man, I'd like to get to shore. No that's a coincidence, so would we. These infernal foreigners. Say, Brad, what's the guys name we're supposed to meet down here? Trevor, Dwight Trevor. Please, if you don't mind. Look, buster, will you settle down? Jamaica will wait for you. That's not very humorous, young man. Please step aside, I want to get ashore at once. I'm in a hurry. Well, if you're in such a hurry. Okay, muscle, too hot to play. Look, Tony, do me a favor. On this job, will you let me relax about you. Okay. Mr. Bartlett and Mr. Carlton. Yeah, I'm Brad Carlton. This is Tony Bartlett. Dwight Trevor, of Fornby and Company. How do you do? Hey, is it always this hot down here? Only in the morning. In the afternoon, the temperature usually rises. This is my boy, Dijion. He'll be at your service if you need him while you are here. This is a boy? Dijion, I'm glad you're glad to have as aboard. Thank you, sir. Take the gentlemen's luggage, will you. I imagine he'll check out our diving equipment. Oh, certainly. He'll have it unloaded for you right away. I'm anxious to get started as soon as we possibly can. Suits me, I'm anxious to get in the water. How long do you think this project will take? Oh, it's hard to say. You'll probably be able to judge better after you've learned all the facts. I suggest we go directly to my office. The Lady Luck was in the service of Columbian company for over 20 years. And here's a full newspaper report on the hurricane. According to the last radio message we received, the ship was at approximately this position when the typhoon struck. The radio went out immediately. But no telling which way that twister took her before she broke up. That's right. All we can do is assume that she sank somewhere in the vicinity of her last known position. No survivors? There were none. She went down with all hands. That's no good. Means we'll have to cover about two square miles of ocean bottom in that area. Could be hit or miss. I'm leaving everything in your hands. Our New Orleans office considers you gentlemen the beset salvage men in the business. Well, we don't get a thousand bucks a day to dig clams. I trust this will be a profitable venture for all concerned. If you recover the cargo, there will be a $25,000 bonus as agreed. How big's the cargo? I see no harm in telling you. You'll find out for yourself if you locate her. Lady Luck carries a million dollars in gold bullion. That's a lot of bullion. A million bucks, I might never come up. I regard her loss as almost a personal one. You see, the day the Lady Luck was launched was the very day I became Fornby employee. Like losing an old friend. Yeah, an old friend with a million bucks. Well, how soon can you get ready? Have to hire a boat, check our gear, two days at the most. Splendid, splendid. You probably need some means of transportation while you are here. My car is the little green one, directly across the street. It's at your disposal, here's the key. Well, thanks. If you want us in the meantime, we'll be at the Caribbean Hotel. Good luck, gentlemen. One million bucks. Do you think he's telling the truth? Sure he is. What's his angle? Oh, why don't you shape up. Does everybody have to have six fingers? This guy's just trying to do a job. It's an awful lot of loot. You know it doesn't seem fair, find a million bucks, only get 25 grand. The set up is a snap. All we gotta do is find the tub, mark the spot, come back some time when nobody is looking You don't need a partner, you need a lawyer. What's the matter, can't I day dream? You better wake up, get your mind off money. Think of something constructive, like dames. What, at a time like... Oh there. Whoo, hooray. Come on bull fighter, let's go. You know, you've got nothing but nerve. Are you kidding? I could have got good. Whoo, I thought this was banana country. Why don't you look where we're going? How could I, our backs were turned. All right, all right, let's get this banana stand out of the way. Will you, come on, give us a hand, will you? Who are you yelling at, mister? We'll take care of the banana stand after you pay me for the bananas you ruined. If you'd look where you were driving instead of gawking like a schoolboy, this wouldn't have happened. I'm sorry, something must have got in my eye. I know, I saw her. Absolutely right, miss, I told him to take it easy, watch his driving, but you know how some men are. Now if there's anything I can do for you... You certainly can. But I'm sure you wouldn't enjoy doing it. All right, Sergei, let's get the rest of this stuff on board, on the double. Well, you know, she sounds like a chief petty officer. Better built, though. Company, halt. All right, wise guys. Let's kick in with about 10 bucks. Hey, hey, how can you be so mercenary? It's easy. Now if you don't mind? I refuse to pay on the grounds of-- Calypso, get a cop. Oh, wait a minute, woah, woah. You win. You haul anything besides bananas on this tub? It's not a tub and I haul anything I can make a dollar on. What time will you be back in Kingston? Oh, we're just taking a little trip. We'll be back in a couple of days. First name Calypso, pleased to meet you. Aye, aye, cap. Calypso. Hey, seriously, wait a minute. You wanna charter your boat when you get back? No. - We pay well. Double the usual price. Come on, don't make a federal case out of this. We apologized, didn't we? No. We paid for the monkey food we ruined, didn't we? The money's good, we made it ourselves. Don't be hard on us. We're nice boys. We're loaded with complexes, don't confuse us. All right, all right. Save the jokes. That's a good girl. I'm Brad Carlton. This is my completely irresistible partner, Tony Bartlett. Thanks, you wanna bite? No thanks. I'm Terry McBride. This is Mama Mary and Calypso, you already know. Hi. Now what about the boat? What do you want to chart it for, fishing, sponging? We got a salvage job. Salvage? We're divers. We got a deal Fornby and Company. Oh, the Lady Luck. Know anything about her? Only that she was hit by a hurricane and went down with all hands. Double the price? That's right. You got yourself a boat. For that kind of money, I can afford to cancel a trip. You can come aboard whenever you're ready. Aye, aye cap. I think I'd like to be her first mate. Coffee? Brad. Why thanks, skipper. How's he doing down there? Still with us, Tony? Yeah. Where else do you expect me to go? Hey Brad, our property pour, acres and acres of ocean and all mine. You spot anything? None. Not even a mermaid. Well, they probably heard you were coming. Nothing yet, Mr. Trevor. It's most discouraging, five days and not a trace of anything, not even a piece of wreckage. Yes, it is rather like looking for the proverbial needle in the haystack. Are you sure the position on this chart is accurate? Oh, yes. According to the last radio message from our captain, this is where they were. Not bad. You know, for a skipper, you're a pretty good cook. Say, when this clam bake is over I'd like you to show me around Kingston, how bout it? Swell, but what'll we do with Terry? Very funny. What's your opinion, Carlton? Any sense in continuing this fruitless search? Hard to say. Well, you've covered this entire area pretty thoroughly. But it seems incredible that she could have disappeared so completely without leaving any trace. It's a big ocean, Mr. Trevor. Unfortunately, we can afford to cover every square mile of it. No telling where she might have settled. We're at about 30 fathoms now, but there are places around here where the bottom drops off to nothing. Oh, Captain Clive, I am afraid I'll have to notify my home office to write off the Lady Luck and our cargo as a complete loss. Yes, I agree with you, Mr. Trevor. You'd better bring your partner up. Well, that's that. Okay, pal we're going up. Party's over. You can't do this to me. 1000 bucks a day ain't hay. Well, that's life. Hang on, here we go. I'm almost sure I'll spot something in a couple of days. Oh, knock if off will you? We're divers, not promoters. Wanna hear me sing, Calypso? We walk along the ocean floor We won't care, follow me, don't work more Got the sharks swim by And a wiggly swing The wind swim by anyone we meet There's coming for night, so what's the pull 'Cause if I do What happened? I don't know. Tony. Tony, can you hear me? What's the matter? I must have stepped in a gopher hole. Are you all right? Don't go away, I'll let you know. How you doing? I don't know yet. My air hose is caught. It's squeezed between the rocks. Pressure's going up. He's not getting enough air. You want me to come down? Ah, don't be a hero. I can get it loose. You'd better hurry, buster. I'm trying, but I've got to take it easy. Get my gear ready, quick. I'll be right down. Save your air, relax. I'm in. All the way to the bottom, no stops. It's 30 fathoms. I'd take it in easy stages if I were you. You haven't got a pal down there that might wind up fish bait in a couple of minutes. Let's go. 30 fathoms. He's on the bottom. When I give you the word, let Tony's line go. Pull my line up as fast as you can. No, he'll get the bends if he comes up too fast. You'll get the bends if you come up-- Don't argue, just do as I say. Up, up. Bring him up, bring him up. How long does this last? Well, he should have come out of it by now. Wasn't too deep, it's just that he came up too fast. Must have been something I ate. Thanks, hero. You're welcome, Buster. Next time do me a favor. Huh? If you have trouble with your air hose, don't answer your phone. Here you are, sir. Oh, thank you, Stewart. I have your money for you. Sign here please. After you. Cash, as you requested. Although it wasn't necessary. I assure you any draft issued by Fornby and Company would have been honored anywhere. Oh, it isn't that, it's just that we find cash easier to spend. As you wish. Are you leaving for New Orleans immediately? No, we'll stick around a couple of days. Yeah, he's crazy about the climate. Well, thank you for your cooperation, gentlemen. I'm only sorry our search couldn't have been more fruitful. Hey, maybe we're giving up too soon. Maybe a few more days of diving will do the trick. If it were my ship and my crew, I'd probably never give up. Unfortunately, I'm only acting as my employer's representative and as such, I am forced to follow their instructions. You were engaged so that they might conform with maritime insurance laws. Now the Lady Luck is a closed pursuit. Well, if anything comes up that changed the situation, let us know. I will, I will. Excuse me. Hello? I will. Big man. Very well. I'll be there tonight. Well, thank you again. Good bye, good luck. Take it easy. See you around, eh? Mr. Trevor, come in, come in. Get the gentlemen a chair, dear. Mr. Trevor, I believe you know Captain Mendoza. Oh, yes. Yes, we know each other. What's the matter, the Obeat people got you bothered? You oughta be around when they really get worked up. You said you wanted to see me. That's right. Captain's ready to make a deal with us. Well? I will pay you 50 cents on the dollar. 50 cents on the dollar for gold. Gold is not so easy to dispose of, my friend. There are not too many markets, and a million dollars worth, I would rather carry other contraband on my boat. Oh, we'll have to talk it over. Well, I say goodnight. I have business in Port-Au-Prince. I will be back in maybe two weeks. Should you want to reach me, my boat will be anchored in the same place. Montego Bay. You will let me know when you are ready. You'll hear from me soon. Just have the money with you when you do. All right. my friends. I figure he oughta hear from us in about two weeks. Two weeks? Have you lost your mind? How can we deliver the gold in two weeks? We can't make a move until the Lady Luck is completely forgotten. Maybe you can wait that long, but I can't. You will have to Captain Meade. Sorenson, Ralph Soreson. Captain Meade went down with the Lady Luck, remember? Don't ever forget it was me who had the guts to give out the wrong position when the hurricane hit. At that time, it was practically suicide, but it made everything easy, no inquiries, no questions asked. While you were sitting in that air conditioned office acting a big man, I was knee deep in this slop. But you had to stay hidden. I know. But we waited long enough. I gotta get that gold. Now look here, if we act hastily now, we may ruin everything we've worked for. We've worked for? We've gotta make our move now before somebody accidentally stumbles onto what's left of that ship. But that couldn't happen. All my reports cover an area miles away from where she went down. How do you know where she went down? I don't. The position I listed in my report was the one you instructed me to give. You don't think for a minute that's her true position, do you? I haven't the vaguest idea. I merely assumed that. Just keep assuming. Don't you think it's time you told me, just in case. You must really think I'm stupid. That's my big ace, the location of that ship, and you want me to purr it in your ear. That's very cute. I'd wake up some morning stone cold dead and you're a million in front. Sorry, friend, wrong angle. I happen to hold an ace, too, which I do not believe, captain, you are in any position to ignore. The authorities will be quite anxious to hear why you remain in hiding all these months should you happen to turn up alive? They won't hear unless you tell them. And I've no intention of telling them. So I say we wait until I give the word. We wait. Goodnight, Mr. Ralph Sorenson. Big white drums Thick and full Filled with rum and good old gin Brandy, next, fill the empty space Sit awhile, sip Fall on your face Oh, give him this one on the house, then throw him out. Before you drink the rum spot special, give us your name and address so we know where to send the body, huh? You're all alone here? Stick around, see what I can do for you. Come on, lighten up a little, will you? When are you gonna learn, a dame is a dame? Terry's no different. What are you trying to prove? Maybe she was telling the truth. Maybe she has got a business dinner. Yeah, it's possible, but I guarantee she's not talking about boats. Welcome to the rum pot. Hi. Well, I hope you brought me some Yankee dollars, huh? We're loaded, honey. Oh, boy, let me show you the tables. Oh, a table we can find. It's company we need. And company's what I got. Hey, Helen, Marie. You're gonna love these two girls.

You're doing all right. Maybe I oughta call her. Play hard to get, that's what I always say. What do you always say? Maybe I oughta call her. No, the trouble with you is you have no Latin charm. Look, listen to me. Come here, honey, give me your hand. You should have gotten what I said. What's the matter, honey? Don't you like me? Not particularly, but keep on talking. It helps clear the smoke. Oh, this is gonna be a long night. I can make a bad man good I'll make him change his livelihood Let me make it understood I am a gal you want to handle with care I can make a good man bad Wishful thinking never had I can make a sad man glad I am a gal you want to handle with care If a man is wise, I'll make with the eyes That'll do it every ooh If a man is coy, I have to employ Things I didn't learn in school I can make a bad boy good Teach him like a teacher would Make him act the way he should I am a gal you want to handle with care Daddy, Daddy, buy me that.

Well, you see, but I've gotta change. You look all right to me the way you are. Some other time, mister. I've got to change. Look baby, when I wanna buy somebody a drink, I wanna buy them a drink, sit down. Hey waiter. Now where you're going? Where else? She's all right. She can handle herself. Yeah, I know she can. What a chance for an introduction. Hey, what's gonna happen to our romance? That's the way it goes, baby. It's life, it's life. Boy never will learn. You see, baby, this ain't so bad. Look pal, why don't you lay off? Say please. Pretty please. That's better, now shove off. Come on, sweetheart, get out of the way, will you? You know, bub, I'm getting a little sick of you. Oh, don't do that. I might have to hold your head. Tony's not gonna like that. Popcorn? They're killing him? Talking about? They're hitting him on the head. Never find him. Tony's getting old. Two years ago, in LA, he handled three six footers for five minutes before they knocked his brains out. Where you been? I had a good seat in the balcony. Boy, you're dynamite. Hey, what do I do for-- Oh, don't give a thought. Never lost a penny in ruckus like this. Tomorrow night they'll fill the joint. Excuse me. Where you going now? To the victor belong the spoils. He's the victor? Hello. Hello. Your friend out there was very rude. He forgot to introduce us. My name's Tony Bartlett. Mine's Venita. It's Venita? That's me. Hello. Hello. How 'bout a drink? Well, no thanks. I've really got to change. I like you just the way you are. You know, the last time a man said that it started a fight? No kidding. Tell me about it. Might take a long time. I'm in no hurry. Rum Pot Athletic Club. Got it. Hey, is there somebody by name of Brad Carlton? Excuse me, ladies. Telephone. Hello? Hi, remember me. Hello, Terry. Sorry about our date. - Date. Yeah, you and I. What date? You forgot all ready? Oh, yeah. - I had some business come up. That's okay. I realize business comes first. I knew you would. How come I hear bottles? Oh, it's just causing a couple. Just a couple, huh? Well I got-- - Take you home? Take you home? Well, if it's too much trouble, you don't-- Okay, I'm sorry. So you're forgiven. How soon? I'll pick you up in five minutes. It's going to take you that long. I just left. Hurry it up. How do you feel? All right. How do you feel? Mighty nice. Maybe just a little bit leeward, but I like it. You're gonna invite me aboard? Nope. For a good night's smoke? Well... Good. I thought the shoulders were pads. First time I ever kissed a skipper. How did a little girl like you ever get to be a skipper, anyway? Inherited this boat from my father. He was a wonderful man. Great skipper. Woah, woah, now. This could become a habit. Well, I hope so. Goodnight, Brad. Would you believe me if I-- No. I'm sorry. I guess the rum exploded. I know, I can feel it. I suppose you think I'm other fellas. You mean there's somebody different? Oh, that kind. Well, happy bananas. I thank you. I leave in a week. You'll be gone a week. That's the story of this romance. You'll live. Oh, sure. This is a lot of boat. How much of a crew have you got? Just Calypso and Mama Mary. Not enough. Oh, sure it is. Oh, no, bad wind, wet weather. You can get in a lot of trouble. Okay, I'll go along with you. Oh, now wait a minute-- A good man, able seaman, experience, no salary. The answer's no. Why not? Because. Great, then it's settled. I said no and I mean no. Good night, Brad. Holy mackerel, must be whales. Oh, you don't. How'd you like to go in with me, huh? No. Oh, what a setback. You really got it licked. Makes a guy think of buying a little boat, spending the rest of his life just crawling up the coast line. I don't think you'd like it for a city guy. No excitement, no sunken treasures, just a man and et cetera, et cetera. It's the et cetera that gets me. Guy can get pretty tired of being on the go. Five years moving mines for Uncle Sam, five more eating oxygen. I think I'm pretty sick of it. Why don't you settle down? Well, thanks for the proposal. Oh, that's what I like about you. No ego. Don't you think I could cool off and lead a normal type life. If you wanted to. What do I have to do? Grow up. Stop thinking about your medals. Get married? It might help. Maybe it would work. Could buy a little boat like this, find a girl like you. Other hand, if I found a girl like you, the boat goes with it. Don't let the salt air get you sick. You're comfortable now and you've got that get married feeling. Few hours back in town, a couple of laps with Tony, and it'll all go away. Oh, wait a minute. I like you, Brad, and I hope you like me. Okay. Now if you don't mind, sir, I'd like you to kiss me. Orders is orders. Oh, that's a good boy. Now you get some rest. Well, that's a good boy. What are you thinking about? You. Come on, now, come on. What is it with this Venita stuff? That's my name. Yeah, Venita from where, the whole book? All right. It's Mary Lou Beetle from Evansville, Indiana. I'll take Venita. How fast three days can go, eh? Have you made up your mind yet? What, about New Orleans? I'm waiting for you to make it up for me. That's all that keeping you, we're practically there. Well, no, it's not that simple. It's not easy to give up old ties and old friends. Any old friend in particular that you don't wanna give up? I'm trying to think of one but I can't. Look, I do all the clowning in this family. Get your coat, I'll go out and buy you something. Like what? I don't know. The world? Hey, waiter. Check. Keep the change. Thank you. I wanna talk to you. Some other time, pal. How'd you like to cut yourself in for part of that million in gold? How'd you like to take a flying jump at the moon? The name is Sorenson. I know where the Lady Luck is. Yeah? That's right. Why don't you nail it? I'm no diver. I don't usually make conversation with raving maniacs. I've got a direct question to ask. How do you know? This oughta take care of the questions. There's $1000 If you don't find the gold, you're ahead. If you do-- - Yeah. I'll give you $50,000. What would happen if I went to Fornby and Company with your proposition? I just don't think you will. When do we start? First what about your partner? Don't worry, I'll handle him. I'll be in touch with you. How much further? In about a half an hour, we'll be over Port Royal and the Lady Luck. Is that where she went down? Right smack in the middle of the sunken city. You head for west bay waters? Yes, sir, what about it? You make dive for three hour, we don't go. Sunken city taboo. He no go. Wanna go back, you'll have to walk. Go on, beat it. What's eating him? Forget it, just superstitious. What's all this malarkey about sunken city taboo? It's supposed to be haunted by the spirits of the people who drowned when Port Royal dropped into the ocean, about 250 years ago. Guess they never knew what hit 'em when that earthquake and tidal wave struck. A big section of the city, sunk into the ocean, along with about 5,000 people and millions in pirate loot. If there's so much loot down there, why haven't other divers been down there to get it? A lot of other divers had tried, but no one's come up with a dime. Till now. Just forget about the fairy tale. Be sure you put me right down on top of Lady Luck. Are you sure this is the spot? As close as I can figure. Gotta be within a quarter mile one way or the other. All right. Tell your boys not to get too superstitious and forget the pump. Don't worry. I can't afford to let anything happen to you. All right, but on the face plate. Shut up. Start pumping. And stop thinking. Well? She's right there. Right smack in the middle of town. How is she? She easy to get at? Can you get-- One at a time. Take off this tin hat first. Get that thing off him. She's resting on her starboard side, couple of sticks of dynamite, and everything oughta tumble out right into my lap. Our laps, don't ever forget that. All right, all right, our lap. Watch it, hey. You never did tell me how you knew where to find it. What's the difference so long as we found it? Mendoza's still back a week from tomorrow. He'll anchor at Montego Bay. We'll make the dive the day before and we'll have everything ready for him. Will he have the cash with him? Everything's settled. Except one thing. Except what? I want a bigger chunk. I thought we made a deal. What deal? How do you figure things oughta go now? 50, 50 up the line. And if I say no. I'm ahead 1000 bucks. I'll give you a third. One half. I said a third. Okay, you just made a deal. And Bartlett, one more thing. Huh? You step out of line again and I'll cut your guts open. Better get a sharp knife. I don't cut easy. You know, I've got to admit something. Well, what is this you've got to admit? I gotta admit, I'm glad you begged me to come along. Delighted. Just one of those lucky little twists of fate, I guess. Never would have thought of it myself. Great, thanks. It is lovely, though, isn't it? Baby, that's the understatement of the year. What is that racket? Sounds like native voodoo drums. Is it the Obeat people? Yes, but why is voodoo now? You mean they still practice voodooism around here? It's not common but it still goes on. Why? What brings it on? Anything's liable to start it, superstition, fear. The Obeat people are supposed to be able to drive away the evil spirits. What can they do for heartburn? You ever seen one of these shindigs? Neither have I. What do you say we row ashore and take a look? Calypso, pull in the skiff. What's it all about? I don't know yet. This passage of our sacred rite. Listen closely to my words. They are meant to warn you. Today, someone went down in the waters of Port Royal. The sunken city. He or you or no one else must ever go again. When the waters are disturbed, the spell of... will ring and wake up the spirits of the dead, and they will rise against you and all people like you. You think it was Tony? None of the native divers would ever go down into Port Royal. You must stay away from the sunken city, let the dead stay dead. We better get out of here. Oh, sweetheart, you're gonna love New Orleans. It's like you. It's got everything. You know I'd also love a cozy place like this. Yeah, with or without me? With you, of course. After we're married. Married? Well, yes, isn't that what you meant? Yeah, sure. But I couldn't do that to a girl like you. It wouldn't be fair to you. Why not? Well, you have your career and friends, old friends, I couldn't ask you to come up for some old broken down deep sea diver. Well, now for some old broken down deep sea diver, I wouldn't, but for you I would. Now isn't that why you wanted me to go to New Orleans with you? So we could have our honeymoon there? Honeymoon? Honey, are you sure I used words like marriage and honeymoon? I'm usually pretty careful in my language. You know something, Tony? - Huh? If I could make up my mind to marry you, I could also make up your mind to marry me. I bet you could. Honey, you can't rush into these things. Marriage is a very important step. You've got to give it a lot of thought. Gotta think about it a long, long time. Long enough for you to get to New Orleans alone, Tony, is that what you mean? What's so hot about New Orleans? Take my advice and stay right here. You're better off. I'd better drive you to the club. You'll be late. Let them wait for me. But you're liable to lose your job. You don't wanna throw away your career on a guy like me. Think of what our kids would be like, full of bends and nitro bubbles. Honey, I'm not afraid of that. Maybe you're not but I am. I better go outside and knock. Oh, no, no, stay right here. Venita was just going, weren't you, baby? Here's a key to the car. I thought you were gonna take me. Oh, Brad and I have a couple of propositions to talk over. Will I see you after the show? Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure, sure. Goodbye, goodbye. Yeah. What goes on? I never thought you'd be ducking that. Well, I guess I must give women the wrong impression. She wants to marry me. Well, you could do a lot worse, and you probably will if you pass her up. All right, pal, all right, save it. Hey, I've been waiting for you to show up. What would you say if I told you that I found the Lady Luck? The Lady Luck? Yep, right on the bottom of Port Royal. She's sitting there big and fat, fat with gold. So it was you who went down the sunken city? Where'd you hear it? I heard. What did you make the dive for? For us, Daddy. I'm gonna make a rich man out of you. Here. There she is. Just sitting there waiting for us to come and get her. Couple of sticks of dynamite, and we'll be rolling in gold. Will be the softest $25,000 we ever made. When does Trevor want us to fish it out? A week from today, but Trevor has nothing to do with it, and we're not settling for any 25,000. We're getting a third for our take. I don't follow. Well, here's a rundown. I found a man who knew where it was, and it wasn't Trevor. Keep talking. That's it, I made a deal. We get a third, of which you get half, if you want it. Well, what about Trevor? What about Fornby and Company? Well, what about 'em? You must be walking on your heels. Who is this mystery man? Where did he get that star-- Would you quit being a quizmaster. All you've gotta know is that I know where it is. We take it and we're in gravy, that's all. That's not all. We can't just walk down there-- Look, will you listen to me? This is the biggest shot we've ever had. A chance to grab a load and lay off from here on in. Now don't get touchy about it, just climb on, will you? I don't know, Tony. What's the matter, you're blind? Can't you see it, there's no holes. We can't miss. This is it. We'll never get another chance like it. We talked about it for years. All those nights sweating out that stinking law. This is what we were looking for, a potful. I gotta bow out. Should have figured you'd go that route. Look, meathead. Don't you think I've got an itch to go along with you? I'd like to latch onto that dough, but you haven't got a chance. You gotta strike out. All right, boy scout, if that's the way you want it, but from now on, you go single. I'm not blowing this parlay. Listen to me, five minutes after the law gets wind of this, they'll be right down your throat. Who's gonna tell them, you? So if my information is correct, then we find the Lady Luck, here's your gold, right in here. But the whole thing is so fantastic. How could you, an outsider, come across information like this? I used a Ouija board. What difference does it make where I got it? I'm merely trying to judge the validity of this information. For all I know, this may be the figment of someone's imagination. It might be but I don't think so. If it isn't, Fornby and Company get their gold back and I get a salvage fee. If it is, all I get is my feet wet. Come on, what have you got to lose? I admit it's a shot in dark, but if I were you, I'd take it. Just one question, what, if anything, does your partner have to do with this? Nothing, except this. When and if I come up with the gold, he gets half the bonus. All right, if that's what you wish. When can you be ready? I can be ready to make a dive in the morning. We'll use the American Beauty. Excellent, excellent. What about the port authority? I'll need a permit. I'll make the necessary arrangements. I'll meet you on board, tomorrow morning. Right. Now one moment, Carlton. I prefer that we keep that entire matter quiet. If anyone else has designs on that gold, I don't think it's a good idea for too many people to know what we are up to. That makes sense. Furthermore, I'll have to make arrangements for its safekeeping. Our holds here are too small and you just don't leave a mIllion dollars in gold lying around. That's your department. After I bring the gold up, I don't wanna have anything more to do with it. Then we're in accord. See you in the morning. Stewart. Yes, Mr. Trevor? Get me captain Pedro Mendoza, SS Island Queen, Port-Au-Prince. We're the SS Island Queen, ready Kingston. There you are, sir. Yes? Hello, Mendoza? That shipment we spoke about will be ready tomorrow. Can you handle it? Good. We'll sail with the tide. I should be in Kingston in the morning. Fornby Docks, is there anything else? Come in. About time you showed up. Sit down. What's the matter with you? You hear that? What, do you think I'm deaf? You drag me down here just to listen to an audition. Those tom toms are for us. How touching, you mean they're playing our song. Tell him. It is Obeat people. They have sworn vengeance on those who have broken taboo on sunken city. It is not good. They've been going at it ever since you made that dive. So what? I know these characters. They'll keep going till something busts loose, and I don't wanna be around here when it does. All right, all right, what do you want me to do about it? Means we'll have to move sooner than we figured. We gotta get that gold and get out of Kingston while the getting's good. Okay, tomorrow morning, what about Mendoza? I tried to reach him at Port-Au-Prince but he's left, no one knows where, but I know a spot up the coast where we can hide the gold and wait for him. Okay, whatever you say. Where you going? I got things to do, personal things. Unless you want me to sit here and hold your hand while you listen to the currencies. All right, shut the door. Are you certain you are using enough dynamite. You wanna blow up the ship? Just wanna blow a hole in her. Let the charge, Calypso. Let me lean on this rail. Well, here it goes, a beautiful friendship. Born, Los Angeles, 1939. Died Jamaica, 1952, rest in peace. What are you talking about? What do you think Tony's gonna say when he finds out I beat him to the gold? But you're only doing this to keep him from spending the rest of his life in jail. You understand that and I understand it, but do you think Tony will understand? Let her go. Well, I hope it's all clear down there by now. Pick out a plate, let's go. He's on the bottom. Check all your gear? Yeah. What about those two jokers you brought along? Don't worry about them. They're good boys, I took care of them. Just worried I steal a million bucks every day. Don't go away, folks. I found something and I don't think they're cigar boxes. Guess what I found. He found the gold. Wonderful, Carlton, wonderful. Anything missing? How many boxes? Is it all there? Look, Mr. Trevor. It's tough enough down here just getting around without having a running conversation. Lower the basket. Hey Sorenson. What? The American Beauty. You sure? Take a look for yourself. Trevor, and a diver down there. How much did you tell that pal of yours? I had to tell him enough to try and bring him in with us, didn't I? You didn't have to tell him the exact location. How was I to know he'd pull this? Boat is coming. Lots of boats use this channel. Yes, I suppose so. How long's he been down there? For about five minutes. Seems like five years. I say, how's it going down there? I'll send you up a written report. Get away from that pump. No, sir. Get away from there. What's the matter with the pump? My air's gone. Turn, get back on the pump. Stay where you are. The rest of you get back against that cabin wall. Wait a minute. Stay out of this. Don't be stupid. What have you got to gain? We want the bullion, there's a diver below, let him bring it up for us. All right, you, get back there. Quick, sugar. Keep an eye on that guy. Now, listen to me-- Nothing to get excited about, Trevor. Take it easy, nobody will get hurt. But the gold. I'll get it. Just like I always planned. And me? You'll get it, too, but not the way you planned. Tony, what is this? Shut up. You know, my pal's down there. You turned out to be a couple of beauts, huh? He's only doing this to keep you from going to jail, he knew you would never get away with it. Save it, sister. Hey, what's going on up there? Give me that thing. Hey you down there, just keep on working the way your are. It would be a very simple thing to cut you loose. But you can't do this to me! After all I've planned. Get back, then. Go on, get back there. Now let's not have any more hysterics. Brad, Brad, are you all right? Pull him up, pull him up. Brad, Brad, are you all right? Dijion, Dijion, Dijion, give me a hand. Brad. His line is cut. Brad. - Calypso. Hold it right there. You get a crowbar. Pull the side. Man, cut these bolts loose before we pack up. We're getting out of here till this blows over. No, no, you can't go away and leave Brad down there. That's just what we're gonna do. Cut that bolt loose. I'll give you two seconds to get back here. Pull me up, pull me up, help. Out of the way, here comes the sea. Out of the way, out of the way. Brad. One, away. Tony, Tony. Tony. - Take it away. Take it away, Tony. Hey, I found him. He's not getting any air. Stand by and be ready to haul up on the basket line. Pull the line up. Pull him up. Hold it, hold it. Now grab more lines and haul. I'll be glad to kiss this place off. All that voodoo business gave me the creeps. It's like radar. They seem to be able to feel things coming. They sure called a turn on our little job. If we'd had any sense, we'd have stayed away from there. They can keep it. I wouldn't go after the million bucks again for a million bucks. Now, you're smart. I'm not smart, I'm scared. Pardon me gentlemen, but the captain says he'll be ready to marry you as soon as we get three miles out. Carlton, Mr. Bartlett. I didn't think I'd get here in time. What's up, Calypso? Mr. Fornby just flew in from London. He's been looking all over for you to bring up the gold. He said you can write your own ticket. What are we waiting for? Tony, wait, what do we do? Honey, a buck is a buck. We'll take a later boat. Don't go away. Oh, great. Terry, do you think we'll ever have a honeymoon? Sure, we'll have it, but it looks like it's gonna be underwater. Well, let's get the luggage.
