Well, how are you boys? Which boys? Paavo and Veikko and Seppo and Heikki Your own sons Grandma, I am Erkki Of course. Who you thought I thought you were? Read to me a little bit from that Bible Which part? Of course from the Gospel of Luke Read about the "hammerhead man's" servant - about how Jesus cured him That's the kind of healing I am waiting for also while laying here And a certain centurion's servant, who was dear unto him, was sick, - and ready to die, and whom he respected dearly And when he heard of Jesus, he sent unto him the elders of the Jews - beseeching him - that he would come and heal his servant. And when they came to Jesus, they besought him instantly, saying, That he was worthy for whom he should do this: For he loveth our nation, and he hath built us a synagogue. Then Jesus went with them. So Jesus went with them And when he was now not far from the house, - the centurion sent friends to him, saying unto him; - Lord, trouble not thyself: for I am not worthy, - that thou shouldest enter under my roof; - Wherefore neither thought I myself worthy to come unto thee: - but say in a word, and my servant shall be healed. For I also am a man set under authority - having under me soldiers, and I say unto one: - Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; - and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it. When Jesus heard these things, he marvelled at him, and turned him about, - and said unto the people that followed him; I say unto you, - I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel. They returned to the house, found the servant that had been sick. I haven't found so great faith not from Israel either. I don't know I say to you, Matti - that going around with those guns and the business of hiding them - it shall end right now. And as far as I know - it's not even lawful to bring those home from the front. Is it? I don't know what grandma is talking about Hey, I saw with my own eyes - when you buried that gun next to the threshing barn I still know many things - and keep learning more every day I accept the civil guard guns - but now it's different times Paasikivi is the president now. He's not like "Ukko-Pekka" Grandma rests here now in peace and quiet You'd think that a man's head has gotten a little common sense - from revolts and two wars - to end the temptations of pointing guns at people - when two brothers are resting in hero coffins under the gravestones I don't anything about those Get up! Damn it! Get up! I... both of them! Don't go anywhere, Erkki! Erkki! Erkki, don't you let him go alone to the town! Where are we going? You will see At that intersection... people have died in the past Not many enough Go to hell! Come out so we can talk a bit What do you want? You know that really well Off the phone or I'll bend your husband's head off God damnit! Holy sky How can you charge people like that It is a crime. - Money! There's no other money, perhaps tomorrow I get the next pay Money! Satan...! God damnit, maniac! Let it be the last time This Hakala charges here on Sunday like possessed devil and begins... This is private business Have you been threatened with guns? This is a minor offence Things become common, when it comes to waving the arms What are you? It's our new police, Matero Don't let it where people are - before it has learnt how people behave here Boys, it's best that - you negotiate about textile mill's business during working hours Put that gun in the closet and let it be there Hakala boys go home now Well? Veikko spanked the business partner a little bit Do you play "dog"? - I don't have time now He has no time now. He's in hurry Shut up dudes Wasn't Jesus your son? Come on now good boys, it's Sunday morning There's grandpa's earnings from America Hearts shark Diamonds great, said glass master I've got my heritage Would anyone go to church with me? Laina, you come I've no time to come and listen to priest's twaddling today It's him, if other one cuts from the pack I don't let you cut He cuts if he cuts There's no need to make it happen. Let the veteran show Don't begin to teach them card swindling at least on Sunday Markku! Where did you spend your night? It's none of your business Did you look at this? Do you see? "Tomcat's damn" Hey see who's coming! Welcome Good day. - Hello, hello Maledict (you and your tricks) Greetings from Vaasa friends and elsewhere from the world ...stays up Isn't it better to leave that matter alone? It brings us nothing good. - Satan! Some night I'll go and light the new textile mill on fire At least come inside to bellow Hey Matti, I had a dream where we went with your dad - to buy a harvester from the town's cooperate store Your dad had all the needed money with him I was afraid that he'll spend them to some worthless - boozing or going to a bar Well, we made it to the cooperative store - and managed to purchase that harvester Did you really see that I buried that gun under the ground? I guess you think that I am some old senile grandma - but I also know something about this world How could you see it? From the living room window. Straight view to where you're digging The engineer has been made a dog twice already It doesn't seem to help with playing dog - even if the man is educated to an engineer with own money They didn't teach cardgames at the institute Markku, don't smoke in the house, the rooms end up with such repulsive smell Already a third time Seppo, we need get you a bone Bow-wow bow bow... Did you shoot here? Me? - We heard a gunshot from here Car exhaust pipes crackle on the road That's what I was telling too, but I came anyway cos the whippersnappers were so sure Learn to recognize - when it's guns crackling and when it's the tailpipes Whippersnappers Where is that gun? In your restless imagination Come next time in 5 second intervals - so I don't die to laughter, when I have to watch - your primitive wrestling style. - Erkki knows the wresting stuff Don't you have a coach from Nurmo? You do? Grandpa brought a gun here during the war and buried it For what? -The communists were expected to take charge in the country - and execute all officers and Ostrobothnians Let go! It would be superb in moose hunting Is it legal to shoot moose with it? Who could and who don't Hey, I saw how you left with - that biatch from Kauhajoki last night You could care a little bit more how you go about I don't bother How was she... as a human? Not a word so that Taina would hear You are crazy if you think you can do that in secret - at least in Halkosaari of Lappaj?rvi Go further, out of the province When I'm drunk I go so crazy somehow I don't know This is small next to the whole world's craziness He has a bride at the cigarette factory. -No A girl from Kortesj?rvi You don't know anything about anything So you know then? - Always something Hey, you have to tell If Erkki got married soon and began living like other people He wouldn't be chasing some cigar wrapper. He's different man You must tell that to us It's too terrible to hear for female Stop it! At Str?mberg factory in Pietarsaari - there're no workers from Kortesj?rvi anymore Str?mberg at Vaasa, that's Kortesj?rvi people's America I told you Hey listen, I had the weirdest dream All of us brothers were burning the grass on the field Don't start changing the subject Your women business are being dealt with now I don't care to talk about them with you How have you become such awkward person in Pietarsaari? I've told you thousand times Didn't I, Paavo? No single person - shall write his name on Veikko's papers - not crosswise nor lengthwise. - We have heard this Not often enough. - I think so too Behind carpet rugs and "lousko" we shall put a clear house And sir himself sits - at restaurant Ernst in Vaasa wearing a necktie and slurps cognac You wanted to look like great nobleman - and let Ketola take the firm's moneys They were my moneys Ha, were they? Were they? Were they, was this house yours too? Ketola has those moneys now - with them he's banging curd carpets at Toholampi in his own factory Okay, it's like that too We brothers should go one more time to bang I'm not going at least You keep talking about banging - even though half of the house goes as soon as the bank demands Laina, keep your mouth shut, unless we specifically ask you I talk when I please And there's something to talk about with you too I hear you have lost at Sein?j?ki trotting race - 10 thousand marks plain cash Paavo, is your malt barley germinating? We'll see in the autumn Yes, money will be from own malt barley in the autumn You better not dream about making any homemade brews Laina, don't you recall yourself drinking - sauna-scoopful of strong brew so you could get into mood? Don't you recall? So you may talk - when requested I'm just amazed that how can an adult man be so stupid - that goes losing at race, jesus, ten thousand Some big bird was flying at the field What the priest talked about? Pleasant things, like he should talk to old people - about being old and dying and God's mercy - and His son's atonement blood I'm going to swim to Lummukka. You come too Have to think Have to go the station What's there? I'm going to see that the train's last car - hasn't remained by the Matsope mountain. -Hah! Express train nr 69 from Helsinki to Rovaniemi leaves Children will come after a week When you need to be at Pietarsaari? On Wednesday morning 6am My whole family is at home, dividing grandpa's American legacy I'll try to come again later in the evening We get a lot? Alpaca plate and sat pocket watch No kidding? I guess there were couple photos of grandpa and some rags You are timid man They told being harvesting There's nothing new for you there Let's screw before the elderly return from the field Are you serious? Why wouldn't I be? Wait now. I undress this skirt Thank you much You are crazy No, I've got more time in the evening Ketola is making a charge with breaking sanctity of the home Go ahead charging me He said you had threatened to burn the mill I advised him to take ample fire insurance He's advising you to keep mouth shut about burning mills Satan! Aren't my sufferings ending ever? Police chief says that there's been gun shooting here in the morning Such observations have been reported from the town Tailpipes crackle on the road, because tomcats are driving recklessly Erkki, you stay away from Veikko's and Ketola's businesses Is that what you think? Veikko, have you learnt anything from that bankruptcy? Perhaps something You could have kept the mill that small - that you could have managed to handle the office stuff Thanks a lot for advices Indeed you police chief are - exactly such economic adviser - who I've been needing and actually been waiting for Just send me a bill for these advices. I will pay Advices are never worth ignoring. Especially for you In the spring I calculated that cuckoo is calling for me 2 more lucky years I wonder where they might be now? The police chief didn't put you in irons? Not yet You tell me where Markku was last night I don't know I had a dream where Markku had another woman - some bank clerk from Sein?joki - who drove Markku around the province in her own car The dreams always know something I don't know about that Look hey, look after yourself a bit with Saara Why so? Her husband was Nurmo Jymy's champion wrestler What are you talking about? I saw you in Vaasa at Waskia - even though I didn't come to talk to you You could have come Be sure to keep my warning in your mind Those'll never learn to cook proper tasting milk potatoes Those in the Central-Finland don't know what's good No wonder she took you What did the police chief want? He came to give good advices for Veikko Veikko never gets too many of those Right Here we are dividing grandpa's legacies now Out of us only mom has seen him with own eyes But still grandpa is a relative to all of us But no blood relation to daughters-in-law Almost as many daughters-in-law as brothers Erkki is still single He might have a wife... although not own Because of Ida, grandpa went to America I like milk potatoes Pauli will be trained below 3:40 man on 1500m run He has too short legs for that for now Go and put the child to sleep Children's legs grow faster than head and other body How do you know that? You would have become a runner - but homebrew spirits and cigarette smoking spoiled you He got spoiled by looking under womens' skirts Erkki, remember what we talked about We let the food to digest for an hour, then we go As soon as your health allows Erkki, come to the yard Markku! At least don't go to the town We have decided to mock that Ketola that much - that he realizes with whom he has started bustling Let it be We're going to take care of this now, and we need your help - just that much that don't let Veikko get close to Ketola How I'm going to accomplish that? Try this. -Do we dare to offer him sugar wine? Why not dare? He becomes so wicked from it Oh jesus, how humid it is What tomcats are doing here? Damn it! Stop now - that kind of raucous in this kind of weather It's pity that nobody does sugar wine anymore All kinds of folk musician traditions - are kept alive, but not the correct things I'm sure there are brewers still. - Where? Have to know to ask from right people - even if nobody publicly offers sugar wine to you Everybody knows that you've become troublesome since you become engineer At Str?mberg everyone talked about it in early summer Who everyone? - All the workers They said that you are the fucking nastiest engineer there I might be so, but can't get along there otherwise The workers there are from parishes of Ostrobothnia - people who have migrated there and they're so quarrelsome - that nothing else has effect on them except being fucking nasty Nobody can stand this heat I'll go and drive around the town a bit What're you hiding there? This is strength-beverage for the swimming trip We all end up getting god-awful diarrhea Are the boys also coming to the sandpits? They come later if they have time I have couple bottles of Vaakuna-booze... in hiding Don't you boys ever drink half-brewed drinks In 50's your old man, - due to half-brewed wine at Halkosaari in Lappaj?rvi, - got diarrhea shit in his pants on the dancefloor Don't you lie now Don't you recall how wicked it was to ride the bike - standing the whole trip from Halkosaari to home? Don't tell such stories about father to the boys Listen, Laina. It's the best - for boys to know the truth about things in this world There's a muskrat on the shore Maybe it was a rat? Sometimes those come from the cooperative store's warehouse They have to leave from there too. They can't stand that ideology Don't be silly We are going now. - But we will return Markku! Can't I go to the sport field even? Take me with you What would you do there? Just watch Perhaps you start training shot put? Everybody are making hay Under the bench Kauhava is the best place on Earth I would move back but... You really can't find anything that's wrong here? Restaurant is missing from here, one that serves lemon sole I don't know am I leaving at all Of course you'll leave I can't even keep afloat soon I haven't swum for 10 years at least Every man leaves And Erkki gets to drive, cos he's bachelor He's got most idle money to spend... to waste on trivial drives Good day. - Good day I am Rintam?ki from Lapua. - Yes I heard you have established a carpet mill I'm on the same business also, so I was just thinking to... Let's see. At least we can talk Veikko, haven't you been getting booze from the mill? How so. Do they have booze there too? Let's drive via tavern No way. Directly to swim A little bit respect for older brother, I ask Boys keep coming more and more impossible Some day we got to really mock them Nothing else but smash their faces in I still need to drive to Vaasa Rikki may drive We 4 brothers aren't able to - empty a Vaakuna booze bottle in one round anymore? I don't think we need any written contract neither now Okay. Let's shake on it I go and get the bros to witness As long as they don't go spreading the business Our boys? And not me due to my ferocious nature - won't press ahead Joy is love and off the ground - girlfriend likely exists... Aren't you boys of Paavo Hakala? Veikko Hakala's brother's boys Do you know our Veikko? What do you boys mean? Want to talk a little bit about carpet weaving Sure, let's talk. Come and sit Wouldn't it be nice to talk somewhere else than at your place? Isn't this just fine? But if the place gets bloody mess all over? Satan! You could have given a thought earlier, about what you're doing You can take 20 years off - in order to our Veikko's muscles to have anything worth showing I wonder is that enough? Boys, I haven't done anything to you Via the old road There won't any passer-bys So warm like bird's milk In this blood, Paavo, - no need even for an older man to be afraid of heart attack Damn, this is a wrong car Veikko was all kinds of things at first. Like my own, he was always... Yes we know that Especially Veikko's moneys you kept like your own Erkki, don't you dare to go to water? If I had time But now And such man tries to entice Vainio's wife from Nurmo Where's your car's key? Key! I think we'll go and open it at M?hkyl? Let me go! Let it be with that flailing Baseball is fair Ostrobothnian game Baseball ain't Ostrobothnian game Tahko Pihkala created it for military purposes What militaristic there's in baseball? Getting wounded, death, burning, plunging Throwing the baseball is - nothing but practising the hand grenade throwing What kind of war term is death? More deaths happen in civilian life than in war Realities are facts Those I want to always express uncensored Veikko, it's not worth for you to get angry about it Okay, let's shake on it Baseball requires wits and fitness. I understand such games Father said in 50's that it was good that - whole M?nts?l? riot in 1932 went as it went I certainly don't care. - Me neither Dad liked Joona Taipale and Vuosalmi get to fight very sufficiently - with those 32 who had wanted to go to M?nts?l? so much Spirit of Lapua In a stall small - a mare stands, - long time has been without stallion Evening is already darker, - turning to night, - and stallion isn't arriving Evening's already darker, - turning to night already, - and that stallion isn't arriving From far away can hear hoof noice - there that stallion is Together with other - unfamiliar mares, - has began partying Together with other - unfamiliar mares, - has began partying Took, boys, Jesus, satan Surrender! You are surrounded Oh jesus, that tomcat Say, damnit, where you are hurting Cheekbone, you damn vicious Fuck, you did your last trick Show now How did you find this? - Such men find these - who are able to do something worthwile than this everlasting bullshit talk Shoulder... arms! By the right flank, march! Oh hell, I really startled I already thought that Italians attacked here, - the men of red brigades, as I just read about them from the paper Or shore-Swedish fox farmers This is just like... Quickly the gun here, I'll shoot that dog No way in hell you don't It's closed season now. No letting dogs loose to forest They would kill all the baby birds out there You shot here? He's a teacher Out there in the woods I heard a noise of a submachine gun I haven't heard such noise, not since Vyborg shore in 1944 With what we have shot with, since we don't have a gun even? It's closed season. No letting dogs loose in the woods Open fires, they are forbidden in forest I guess it's so From school I know every boy Nothing important learnt there, - except how to whittle naughty pictures on toilet walls Would the teacher like some homebrew spirit? I'm with a car Is it so dangerous to drive to the town in little "kilju"- stoop Shut up, tomcat You don't come here to give me orders We aren't at town school now, and so you can't tear my hair I don't recall ever pulling your hair It's not worth recalling old stuff here Bad homebrew. - Eh? You piece of shit - never had anything positive to say to us On my behalf drink piss from your heads! There were shots fired here with submachine gun I sure recognize that noise. - Exhaust pipes crackle on the road I listened to machine gun crackling - in both wars for real Your father was so careful in everything Do you still have cartridges? Yes, but we don't give them Oh It would've been fun to shoot few times People hear I will take full responsiblity And what sort that might be? Dad's gun isn't yours, and so isn't the cartridges! What's this dog's name? Let me try too Put it to single shot Say, which mug you mean? You shoot over all the time. Take balanced aim You start to guide me? A little bit anyway Haven't come here to listen to any lectures What's that dog's name? Not worth to do rapid fire with this unless in close combat In Winter war at Taipaleenjoki I get to really know this gun Are you still going to drive car today? Hey listen, we should drive to Lappaj?rvi, to my cottage There they are used to my shooting With what you shoot there? Nagan booty. I took it from Russian officer - in July '41, at S?rkisyrj? He just handed it to you? At first he wasn't going to - but then he had to, after he died Seppo should be in Vaasa in the morning acting as engineer I can ring that I'm taking a day off He can actually do it. He's such a higher-up there In the morning we can ring - from Lappaj?rvi tavern to Str?mberg Come quickly now, Paavo On this kind of sand heath... If you had to - deploy infantry unit, how would you do it? Depends, from which direction the enemy's coming from The enemy's always coming from east - from Lappaj?rvi Wait! Drunk we are and driving car - as well as this whippersnapper Hey, you got the worst booze-head in the family I took little bit after eating - cos I didn't care about the hags' babbling It's a 1000 mark stitch for you Satan, this whole car isn't worth even 1000 marks I paid 6000 for this in the spring In your stupidity Got to go and get a tractor from Lummukka house If I deployed infantry unit right here - neighbor would have hard time getting through With a platoon of Ostrobothnians I could hold this for 5 years Who would want this crater anyway? Especially if you'd let TVH-men - transport their sand through here in peace How can you adult man be so stupid - that you let another take all your moneys, and don't fight back at all? If this all is about that I haven't had time, - and no opportunities to go to such... higher up schools as Seppo and you, teacher I've had to stand up to myself Like with that textile mill... It was fulltime job Acquiring clothes and - selling carpets, so that... Then... Plain stealing And goddamn, I think - there's been enough talk about that bankrupt for today If you really need to talk more about it - then go to our place and conduct with Laina She'll willingly talks about it for a week straight Laina sure is awkward person and foul-mouthed Let's go and get that gun now When visiting America they searched for grandpa in Canada - whose heritage we are now dividing here But there wasn't enough time then And as he wasn't at the address I had with me - I didn't continue searching for him in Canada any further The annoying aspect about business trips is that there's - not enough time to do much else than the work At Seppo's age I hadn't been anywhere but Soviet Union And even there a gun in hand They had men here doing installation jobs With old sneakers they bought young girls Really, you live and learn Oh damn it, can't hit anything with this Hey hey, don't, damn it! Boys, boys... I'm loading... Is it okay here to pay - with old man's cash? Hey, this is lake iron Give it here It drips or floats Hey! Let's get submachine gun That'll make some sort of marks Listen I go visit Kauhava and I'll get you in the evening You can trust me Submachine gun Ostrobothnian doesn't trust anybody but himself That's how he differs from Finland's tribes and foreigners Recall, this is what I warned you about I'll bring that submachine gun. Believe now Shall we believe? Oh well, we'll believe the man Where you left the men? At teacher's cottage Surely they've begun boozing there Oh well, at least not Seppo. He still needs to drive to Vaasa I wouldn't bet on that For a pleasure of resting day, - he might have began taking the sour stuff too Was Markku at Lappaj?rvi? Boys went to the sport field. - You swear? Even with 2 hands on top of the bible Don't speak such things I go and look around a bit Hey, bring at least Markku back home He's most likely gone to the tavern At restaurant in Lapua Saara's husband - had promised to beat you spotted with blue together with Saara Would he really hit a woman? Engineer man Hey, he's former wrestler and pungent by temper Erkki, did you come and be our Cossack? Men sure are needed now, - but I can't pay salary for you Working on Sunday is sinful Surely not the greatest of your sins I guess you still recall how to rake the hays on the pole? I can do all sorts of things, but I don't have time now, - cos I'm going to drive around and see old places What old places our fields are for you? Are you going to be here all day long? I have to do what others do too I can't just sit and wait you You could help us I'm out of here How I reach you in the evening? Call me Saara, stop that babbling and start working Hays don't fly on the poles by themselves here Well? Please say something Police chief came and wanted to talk to the boys, Paavo or Veikko Something must have happened to Markku Could you stop squalling there? Erkki, those Markku's businesses aren't rightful Shall we write a report here and now? What fucking report? You'd been looking for me so that's why I came here There are no reports needed We have to speak with Veikko Boys are at teacher's cottage I already sent a whip Matero, could you go to the gas station bar - and drink a cup of coffee for instance? Do you know where your Markku, Raimo and Antero are right now? No Around noon they went to the sport field I went to Lummukka with my brothers There was a call from Lummukka. Do you have a gun? At least none of you has a gun licence Why wouldn't we have? Kind police chief, please let me call home to Maija - so I can tell I didn't get hurt, that I'm doing alright Where is Markku? - At intensive care unit at Sein?joki What the hell has happened here? That would be good to know Police from Sein?joki brought them They had driven to hospital and told - that Ketola had stabbed Markku at Lapua's Straight Ketola claims that boys had come and forced him out of his home - and tried to kill him Forcibly busted in legendary Lapua style How's Markku doing? Ketola had hit him to the head. But his life is not in danger Satan, boys will wrench his head off, when they learn about his Ketola is incompetent at hitting, if he hits head at first blow He's so timid. Swiped in a panic It's good that he hit with Kauhava-blood, - so tabloids don't write - that there's been stabbing at Kauhava with Mora or "S?mi Knife" Knife had slipped over the forehead to the eye Did boys have homebrew booze at Lappaj?rvi? Yes, we had Do you know, who has done it? Yes, but I can't tell. - I see How long the boys are going to be held in custody? As far as I know they haven't stabbed anyone Forcing a man out of his home and taking him to the Lapua Straight for beating is crime in itself Paavo and Seppo are being questioned now - and Veikko's course of events, and of course you too You should order the police to beat Ketola He knows the truth about this Matero would jump and break some ribs of him in pleasure I don't feel like listening to that kind of stuff Makes me bored What the fuck! Let go of that man! Fuck satan! Damn it! Flour squire! I will kill you, satan! Let that be the last time tearing me! No you don't fuck, goddamnit! Let go Seppo, I will kill it! Let go! It's best for the teacher to go home now Nobody asked you to be here Hey! How did you send whip? You were supposed to come yourself? I didn't send it Police are attacking and start dragging Goddamn! Fuck! Let's talk with Seppo first. - Okay Who drove? Erkki What was that shooting, - that was heard from sandpits at Lummukka in the afternoon? We were target shooting with teacher's gun The shots fired at the sandpits were from submachine gun I thought that the teacher had a pistol You haven't bothered to acquire permit for it? I didn't get buying permit for it neither I got it from Russian officer in summer '41 At first he wasn't willing - a bit, but then he consented - after about a finger-size hole appeared on his head Those were such times back then There were no times to ask permits from police chiefs 18 boys are buried - at cemetery by the church in soldier's graves in July '41 Yes, yes. That's how it certainly was And due to my furious nature, I'm not going to - bow my head down Should I go somewhere from here? Sit down over there. Lots of witnesses for once, - when you start talking in the town, that you were beaten at questioning Are you able to answer those questions, - that are going to be asked from you? It depends complete... It depends comp... letely on the questions Where were you in the afternoon? Oh me? A little bit here and there At sandpits in Lummukka? Yes, certainly What did you shoot with there? With submachine gun? No way. Don't talk nonsense How could we have such guns? Wait now, if I really recall hard, - I think I might have heard some kind of crackling from there I wonder what were they? Well, Lummukka farmers probably shot with stump bomb I'm asking this for second time now With what weapons did you shoot with? Did you say that, at Lummukka sandpits? Don't you know, what gun shooting is? Police chief, could it be so now - that at the moment Paavo is too drunk for questioning? There was a call from Lummukka - they say that there's been shots fired with submachine guns We know the Lummukka people What do they understand about anything? Not worth trusting their ideas They lowered their lake's water level and tried to make a field, but - they created such puddle, so that there's no lake nor field now Isn't this clear matter? See, they didn't know how to lower the lake, and now - they don't know when it's guns banging and when stump bombs Lummukka people are having hard times, if war would break out And since they cannot distinguish bullet spurt from pistol shooting Be quiet or go away, - if you can't stop interfering the questionings So what did they shoot with at Lummukka? And how did you go to the teacher's cottage in Lappaj?rvi? Who left with Erkki from Lappaj?rvi? I'm staying 100% with my original story But you haven't said a word about Lappaj?rvi What, haven't you written anything on your paper? Oh jesus, police chief, such man you have as clerk This isn't going anywhere This talk with you is like shouting into the wind Go home or sit there We don't go anywhere until it's we know - who are sitting here in custody Raimo and Antero sit in jail Markku lies in hospital bed with his punctured eye You satan! Listen up boys, - Veikko is in such furious mood - that he's not going to be let out today Go home and go see Markku I go there right now to have questionings Let Veikko and little boys free We take them to beds to recover You can prove anything about Veikko? I assure that he won't get nasty The little boys are done with questioning, yes? I answer for my children It doesn't look like it If you would call to the hospital - and ask, how is Markku doing Hey, don't you start advising - the government employees how to do to the official business Let me out! Let me out! We are coming there. Behave properly Shout then, when you are ready Satan! I'm going to wrench off your arms, when I get out of here Police chief said, that I get to decide - that do we dare to take you home Hey, I still decide what I do Whatever Satan! We wouldn't be here, if you didn't take away that gun! It'd have been useless for Lammi to try to put me into Maija, - cos I would have let her through Try to think yourself, - even though you don't have own children, - that how Laina and I feel. Little boys are in custody - Markku is in hospital at Sein?joki with punctured eye Satan! I don't care about you and your wife at fucking all Erkki, we are going to leave Veikko here to recover Veikko, don't you in hell... Veikko, we aren't leaving you now, or never Here's your hat Satan! Damn I come and get you right after I've taken these guys home Shall we go into the house - or shall we let a tempest appear here? Is this good now, that kids have made it to "knife mouth"? I told Matero that we will see, as long as don't get lathe sliver into eye We sure didn't realize - that he might have knife in his pocket on Sunday What did you tell to the police chief? That Ketola stopped us and began slashing with a knife He won't believe that. -Do you believe that it's all the fucking same for me You'll get suspended from school if you're lucky We don't care I wonder do they really care, what we do on our summer holiday? For sure they care for murder cases You knew all along, what we were doing If they suspend from school, I'll enlist to the paratroopers With such education I can get to America's army They take such men there, who have sense in their head I wonder where such men are found? I could come along I have one doctor friend there He's able to tell, if Markku is losing his sight If you can't be without crying, go back to bedroom I'm going to Vaasa now, you can come along, - if you don't prefer to stay home and drink homebrew I promised to the police chief - that boys don't show their faces in the town today anymore Boys don't go anywhere, if I say so Nothing holds me back Polices may come on the flat, with or without guns I'm not leaving Veikko to be beaten by polices There's no match for two of us in the whole town You don't let Paavo and Veikko free - until I've returned from Sein?joki I know that I should make a change in my life, but what? You want me to figure that out? - No You aren't needed there at all I gladly help my friends The boys' father was my best friend in both wars I didn't know that That doesn't matter too much now I'm not into this because of friendship Let's leave the whole man here Let's just wait Can't make it to Sein?joki without beer... Wondering if the homebrew makes thirsty. We sure know that And recall, that you don't start crying no matter what Do you think that I'm ever crying again in this world Do you remember too, Taina? - Yes I do For sure? Feeling better? I met men from our regiment from the continuation war times - Boys from the Jr 58 I see. Isn't there plenty of that kind around? Bitches quiet! - Who are being called bitch here? A memorial day of S?rkisyrj? battle - may we celebrate here with the boys - in cigarette-smoky bar while lifting medium beer mugs But when the country was in danger, they sure asked then Don't you believe nurse's talks? We came all the way from Kauhava to see man - who is here in treatment, one called Markku Hakala Come during visiting hours But we came now What man you think you are? I'm corpse's uncle Who are all of you? Mom, and Markku's mom and wife. Oh, and I and teacher Come tomorrow during visiting hours The time is on the front door, if you are able to read in the first place We came now Let's go They just have such rules, - that other people than close relatives aren't allowed into the ICU Where do you think that we can find you? Sit down and wait, I'm coming in a minute You may visit, but don't talk too long We had to remove his - left eye. So you know Taina, recall what we talked about We have to talk a little bit That's alright Come to the police station after you've taken your party home - and seen that boys are in safe there What came? We are here... -Taina and your mom and I and Erkki They took my eye and are afraid, that I'll lose sight in another too The main thing is that you didn't get killed I wouldn't be so sure about that It's the same for me, if lose an eye or two For me you are my husband - and together with Pauli we take care of you always Hey, you don't need to take care of me Didn't need to before either What did you say to the police chief? That what we agreed with the boys How come Ketola was carrying knife? We three strong men against that one codger No sound comes out of me Cut the head in half with an axe if you like Stop now, adult man, this childishness We got other things to worry here, than herding you They have taken an eye from Markku's head and the other one might go - so we don't really have time... for you Well, if you seriously want to take me with you, then... It's how this was then It's how this is then, - but the other eye must have the sight, - otherwise it's too unreasonable for him There's nothing reasonable or unreasonable in this world It's always aggravating I also thought, that it was enough for us, - when Martti's brothers were brought from gravel in coffins It wasn't adequate for anything Martti himself got killed under a tractor So I don't have time to believe in any reasonabilities Damn! Satan! That Ketola must be killed before he takes all of our - houses, goods, carpet mills and now even eyes from the boys' heads No more killings and fightings are needed Erkki! At Sein?joki I sure have to help Shut up now! I come when I come Alina always worries a lot Boys, you should go and bring Veikko in the house, - before he decides to go the town Erkki... Give me that dad's submachine gun, - and I'll go and kill everyone What sense would that make? There's no sense in anything You are crazy. -Let's go to the police station and kill everyone there Hey, now it's wisest that we start to think, - what the boys really bustled with Ketola What does it benefit? Well, Veikko, well Veikko, let's just go into the house now I was just wanted to say to you - that you shouldn't join those Lapua people anymore Who do you think I am again? Men go to America, and they die there - in iron mines and Copper Island smelters Boys are sent to wars - and they are brought back in coffins - and get buried next to the church - in soldier's graves Children are born and die Animals give birth and they get killed for food Grains get sown - and when they're ripe, they get cut and threshed Whole world is about being born and dying Every day so many are born and die - that if began to count them - one person's age wouldn't be enough for the task - even if took into account only one day's dyings and births But the Earth stays It changes all the time, but it remains Are you going to remain as long as the Earth? I've been thinking about myself and other women too - and wondered, that in Ostrobothnia all wisdom is in old women They have the wisdom and goodness. Do you believe, Erkki? What's wrong with the men here then? They sure have... insanity Police chief asked me to come here He went to visit home. Asked me to call when you come I came now Why your trunk is open in such downpour? I don't know Matero Was there something valuable in there? Nothing at all Police station, police officer Matero Yes... There is. Just a moment Hakala. It's for you Yes Really I'll come as soon as I can Veikko has escaped to the town His intention is to shoot everybody, first polices Where he got a gun from? I don't have time to explain now Veikko took submachine gun and bullets from me Satan. Does the police chief know already? I just came to tell that Veikko might have a gun From where has he got that? I don't know. Boys are in the town searching for Veikko Matero, don't you shoot them Maybe he has gone hiding somewhere Do you know about his friends? He has some drinking buddies If he has gone with them We will continue looking around Sister went with her husband to visit Mallorca. -I see I thought that we could drive there and make coffee Okay Isn't that man him? - Yes Boys said that your husband is going to kill me some day He might do it as well Have you thought at all, what will happen? I didn't bother to think about you by really thinking What is wrong with your husband? There's nothing wrong with him He is nice man No... Don't That your job Always similar It's like I'm just some kind of... "straight away on your back" for you What are you clinging to me? Able-bodied engineer waiting at home But I was thinking... that... we could be old friends Like people are between themselves How's that wrestler as a bed buddy? It's actually none of your business In Finnish championship competitions he never made it - higher than score point positions How far you made it then? I've never got excited about such - sweaty guys' wrenching Every now and then shoot farts to each others' noses This is why you came here? I can take you home too That's where I have thanked myself - that I didn't join your sled when I was a young girl What would I be now? Pietarsaari worker's wife What's wrong with Pietarsaari workers' wives? You should know them Satan! This is the end Satan! This game's enough What game? - Damn! I know everything Satan! I heard you are driving around with my wife. - like she was your fianc?e Are you Saara's husband? - Yes... at least I've been Hey, come and sit here in the car from that downpour Erkki Hakala. - I know Hey, we are old school buddies together with Saara You shouldn't forget and leave old friends in this world People have very few real friends in this world Don't you betray me An adult man and gets nervous about women's talks One trusted friend called me On my behalf you can keep your wife in complete peace I'm not taking her anywhere This is something I decide myself Think sensibly now You must be able to do it, as an engineer man If they haven't completely squashed your head against wrestling mat - now you go and say sorry nicely to Saara about your doubt Then you'll live with her happily with rest of your life This is not going to stop here Call me when you have something to say, and let's talk Come out of there now and stop making fool of yourself Where are the others? They went to see Veikko. They called from the police He has... died in the prison You killed him with fists or baton? Doctor came already and said, that it was a heart attack That heart attack had good timing Go to the morgue and see I sure will I thought that he had passed out, when I found him at the market place He was just growling Then when I went to the jail to check, he had died Do you know what gun this is? Looks like Finland-submachine gun I know about guns that much too, but where did he get this? He might have bought it. He was a businessman There had been machine gun shots fired at Lummukka in the daytime So there you got plenty of clues then Did you know about this, when you came to warn us? No I'm beginning to be somewhat fed up - with all this lying Has someone lied to you? They left already... everyone I would like to see him too Come in the morning I can come in the morning too, but now I'm going to see Veikko I don't really have time Erkki, goddamn. I heard that they have killed your Veikko Don't you believe all talks Help me a bit now Goddamn! What do you read there in such poor light? You have to dress up into a new person - and change to totally another person You often have to do, what you don't like to - and leave it undone, that you'd like to do. You will see, that what pleases others, succeeds - but that what you want, progresses slowly That what others say, is listened to That what you say, is judged little Others request and receive You ask - but you don't get what you ask That's how it surely is Erkki, you stay alive at least so long, that you can bury me - so that my youngest don't have to be burying me I will try at least
