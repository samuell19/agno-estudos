♪ Deek: It was the after time. I don't remember the old world, because I was born after the corporation ruined it. Their greed caused the great eco-collapse, and now our planet was a dangerous place. The people who were left did what they could. Tried to hot wire the environment. But after the resistance was crushed, most of the adults disappeared... or were taken away. The days of the clear, blue sky were over. ♪ ♪ ♪ In the after time, people lived together for protection, but it was a hard world. only the smart and the strong survived. Get back here! Oof! Sorry. It's big, sir. Better get back down here! Get back here! You don't to make us come up and get you! Gentlemen, what seems to be the problem? Problem is that little punk up there stole that copper off us. I didn't steal it. It was in a free zone. We both went for it and I got it. I have to agree with Adam. Unless this piece was in your living space when he found it, you can't exactly say it belongs to you. Listen here, old man. Kenji, where are you? Just back off before you get hurt, all right? [Kenji barking] Ha, ha... you'll have to use more than that cyber mutt to get rid of us. Was there anything else? Vike, what is it about you? They see you and run. Happens every time. Adam, you're sure it was in the free zone when you picked it up? It was Grandpa. I wouldn't steal it. They tried to take it from me. Thank you for sending Kenji to us. You communicated with him, didn't you? Yes, Grandpa. Good. It means the comm-collar is working. [Pounding on door] Voices: DTs! DTs are coming! DTs are coming! For Adam and his grandfather, the after time was all about fear. Fear of the corporation and the power it had over all our lives. The corporation controlled everything with their thugs, the doom troopers It seemed like no one could do anything, because the DTs might take away your family, or your friends at any time. And the people you loved never came back. That was the way we lived then; trapped in the darkness, frightened all the time. Frightened of the DTs. Once, William had been a general in the resistance, a great fighter for justice, but now he was ill... and there was something he had to do in the time he had left. He had to train his grandchildren to survive outside the only home they'd ever known. Adam! You plan to come over here and do some work, or are you going to stare into space all day? There's nothing for you to see down there. Adam! How many times do I have to tell you? Green is bad. Yellow is good. And avoid anything that grows directly in the sun. Excellent. Adam lived for his grandfather's approval. But there was one more member of the family -- Jada. She was friendly to everyone, but she knew the rules of the game. You were always careful who you talked to. Thanks, Danny. Catch you later. Yeah, later. Be cool. Hey, Jada. Saw you on that rope. I'll give you a 9.5. How you doing, Lizzie? Mmm, not good. You can see what's happening. There's DTs everywhere. Hey, Jada. Do you want to trade? I can make a really good deal for you. What you got? What's the catch? Catch? No catch. I'm getting out of here before the DTs grab me. I can't take everything with me, can I? What would the DTs want with you? I think my brother Danny's in trouble with the DTs. I'm trying to get him to come with me. We hang here they'll mind-wipe us both. It seems like a lot of fun and everything, but I kind of like the mind I've got. Last chance. Get out of here. You should watch it, Jada. They'll come after you too. Something big's going on here. I've got nothing that they'd want. Oh, yeah? What about your grandpa? Bet they'd just love to suck his head right out. I tell you, as soon as they find what they're looking for, they're going to trash this place. Where you gonna go? You've never been outside of here. I have a trick or two up my sleeve. You and your tricks. It won't be as much fun without you around. I'm going to miss you. I still think you should get out. Thanks. Well, I can't, even if I wanted to. It'll be all right. Don't say I never did anything for you. Hey, guys. Got a nice stash of canned food here. Thanks, Vike. So, Adam... heard you got yourself into a little trouble. No big deal. How you doing, Grandpa? I'm fine. Did you get that fire box working again? Yeah, yesterday. You were right. The angle of the lens was a little off. Right, of course I was right. How are you coming with the bug light? Okay, but I can't get the lightning bugs to give off any real light. Try shaking it. Stop... I said stop! Lizzie was right. Things were changing fast. The DTs took one of William's colleagues from the old days, and her brother, Danny. Messing with them really ticked them off. I enjoyed that. You, off the bike. I don't think so. After him! Let's go! Move! Come on! Ahh! Let me go! Get off me, you idiot! Get off! Grandpa... You can't be at the work bench all day and night. You need more rest. Do you see what's happening in here? The DTs are getting bolder and bolder. That's not good. I don't think we need to worry, Grandpa. We're not exactly a threat to them. Don't kid yourself -- To them, everyone's a threat, especially you and your brother. If they know who your parents are. You mean were? Don't be so cynical, Jada. I say your parents are alive. I say they made it to New Eden. I don't want to talk about this. We have to talk about it. You have to plan. Plan for what? Where is this New Eden and how do we get there? We couldn't set foot outside of this building without being stopped by the DTs. So, you're just going to accept this kind of life for yourself. Is that what you're saying? No... No. Look, Grandpa... Maybe New Eden does exist. Maybe somehow Mom and Dad did make it there. But you're in no shape to travel. When you are, we'll talk about it. Until then, we're not going anywhere. I'm never going to be able to make that trip... and you know it. You need to go without me. That's not going to happen. You are going to go... and you're going to lead the way. No one knew where the DTs took their victims... But we knew what happened to them. They were mind-wiped, by one man, Dr. Kao. "So hard to be brave." "Be careful." "I see them." "It's no use, no use." "Too many of them." "DTs! More and more DTs!" "Hide the map." "Hide it." "Last hope we have!" Ha, ha... Who would have thought that you, such unpromising material as you are, would have so much to tell me. So, a map in sector seven. I'm delighted to hear it. And don't worry, I'll take care of it, when I find it. Ahem... Yes? Sorry to disturb you, Dr. Kao. That's all right. I'm already quite disturbed. We have the next two prisoners you asked for. I can hold them till later if you aren't finished here. Bring them in. And we need to talk about sector seven. I didn't think they were ready before now. But Jada is growing up so quickly, isn't she? But I worry about Adam. He has trouble breathing, and I don't know how he will react to the after time. You were a great soldier for me, Vike, and an even better friend. I could never have survived without you. I'll miss you, my friend. Keep this... in memory of our battles together. The kids are going to need you more than ever before. When the time comes, you know what you have to do. Remind me so much of your mother. What happened? Nothing. Go back to sleep. I just want to say goodnight to you, that's all. Okay. I love you, Grandpa. I love you too, Adam. ♪ ♪ Is something wrong? Is it Grandpa? Yes. The old man had died in his sleep, and they were on their own now. William had spent his life preparing them to survive in the after time, and now the time had come. They had to face the future without him. Mom and Dad... Vike... Grandpa. What is this? Voice of William : Dear Jada and Adam. Please don't feel too sad. I loved my time with you both very much. This is a map and some information I've been putting together over the years which I believe will take you to New Eden and a better life. You have to go, not only for you, but for all those who will follow. The future starts today. The journey begins with you. I love you both very much, and will be with you all of the way. Love Grandpa. No... No. It's nuts. I mean, looking for some possibly fictional place that we don't even know really exists? I mean, even if we wanted to, how could we, on foot? No chance. We wouldn't be half a mile from here before we were all mind-wiped. You know that. The journey begins with us. How? Grandpa and I developed something that might help. We call it a road sailor. It can handle a lot of different types of terrain. Well, how does it work? Basically, it uses a kind of magnetic field. Wow. It probably can't outrun the DTs, but it could help us cover a lot of ground. Would it take you a long time to build a couple more? There's two more in there already. Grandpa said we might need them. DTs are coming! DTs! DTs! I think we better start packing. [People clamoring] DT raid! DT raid! That's us. Adam, come on. Adam, we've got to go. No, I can't. You guys go. I want to stay here with Kenji. Hey... I can't tell you I'm not scared too, because I am. I really am; But if we stay here, we could be in even more danger -- You know that. We need you, Adam. We need everything that Grandpa put in here. Okay? Okay. Good. Let's go. Spread out. ♪ Move it. I said move it! Move, move, move! [Mechanized voice slowed down] ♪ ♪ Well, don't it get you down ♪ Wondering how it ever got to be this way ♪ ♪ And you know ♪ It ain't the first time ♪ And when you're coming down ♪ Head on the floor ♪ Oh, everyone forgot your name ♪ ♪ And you don't know ♪ Anyone else's ♪ When you come around ♪ To their way of thinking ♪ Instead of the sinking down ♪ You can only go ♪ So far away Let me see those. Wow. So, according to Grandpa's notebook, there's a layer of vaporized toxic pollution under that plain. That's why they put a check point there. Doesn't look too dangerous to me. Yeah, well, let's check it out. Let's go. Kenji, get down. Why can't we just go through here? No, stop! What? Watch this. [Gas hissing] [All coughing] This stuff is lethal. There's got to be a way around it. Uh-uh, there isn't. It goes on forever on both sides. Through this valley and all the way beyond. We have to get through the gate. But how? I don't know yet. Right now we need food and sleep. We'll think of something tomorrow. Let's go. I'd been watching this group for a while, and something told me they had the map. Hey! You?! Back off! I will if you let me know what you think you were doing. Oh, Vike. It's okay. I can't believe you tried to rip me off like that. Why? I don't know. I thought you were one of us or something. I don't think so. What were you looking for anyway? I thought you might have a map. Do you? Hey, what is your problem? You're the one with the problem. You think you're going to get through all those vapor mines, huh? On your little sailing rigs? If you know about the check point, what do you need the map for? 'Cause that's all I've got. I need to know where I'm going after I get through. Do you really think it's possible to get through? I know it is. I'll make you a deal. take us through with you, and then I'll tell you where we're headed next. So you do have the map. Ah, forget it. I'm not taking your whole family along with me. What if it was just you and me? You'd leave your little brother behind? I don't buy it. Look, the fact is, he and the giant should probably just head back anyway -- He's 12. He's got trouble breathing. We've only been out one day and he's struggling already. He'll never make it. No. I can make it through without your help. If you really believed that, you wouldn't have tried to steal the map. What do you say? Ha... All right. If it's just you and me. But it'll take me a few days. I've got some things to get ready. I'll get Adam and Vike to help. Let them think they're coming with us. See you in the morning. Think this will work? Thanks a lot. [Kenji barking] What is the deal with this animal? He doesn't trust you. I don't think Vike trusts you either. Yeah, well, I'm not here to make friends. Deek, how do you know the DTs will fall for this? Because it's brilliant. Says you. Look, kid, it'll work, all right? You think we'll be safe on this? Yeah, you'll be fine. ♪ You sure you can handle this? Yeah, I'm sure. Let's just go. When I give you the word. You know what to do with these? Yeah. Okay... I've spent two full days watching these guys. Every hour they change the guard. The gate stays clear for about two minutes. Okay. Ready? Yeah, yeah. Get set... Clear! Perfect. Let's go. Light the flare! Stand back. Whoo! Ahh...Ahh! He's gaining. Smoke's running out. Quick, turn! Hang on. Ahh...! What's the matter? You feel guilty or something? You did what you had to do. Don't feel bad about it. Believe me, I don't. Whoo! Yes! [All whooping] We made it! We made it! Yeah! We made it. Whoo! Come on, Kenji. Deek, that was so amazing. The plan worked perfectly. Where did you guys come from? It was so awesome. You took out the gate and the DT guards, exactly as Jada planned, and then we flew through untouched. I just wish Grandpa would've been there to see it. Me too. Just a second. Deek! You proud of yourself? I wasn't going to leave my family behind. You should've known that. We had a deal. Let me see the map! No! Come on, Let me see the map. No! I didn't say I'd show you the map. I said I'd tell you where we're headed next. Ahh! And we're headed to a large rock formation in the middle lands. 20 coordinates to the east, 35 to the south. Under the rock will be the next piece of the puzzle. Well, that's all I wanted to know. But I should warn you that the area between here and there is filled with more quicksand vapor mines and heavy DT patrols. And how do you think you're going to get through that? I've got directions. I don't believe this. Come with us. Deek, I know how good you are at taking on the DTs. But you saw how we got the van ready for the check point. It took half the time it would've taken if you'd done it yourself. We can help each other. I'll come with you. But if I want to take off, any minute, I'm gone. Okay, that's fine, Deek. We won't stop you if you want to leave. ♪ We moved into new terrain, the middle lands. It was a threatening place. The map told us we could live off the land, but we had to be careful because the eco-collapse had made many of the plants poisonous. For the first time, we understood the scale of what we had taken on. It was scary. We went on, uneasy, looking for the rock. I had to admit that the wind sailors were pretty cool, and the group was tougher than I thought. As we traveled deeper and deeper, the land looked empty, but we were easy targets. We all knew that the DTs were out there. Time was on their side, not ours. We received a satellite response from the quadrant supervisor at check point 17, sir. Talk to me. Bit of a mess. A successful assault was launched on the check point and a group of young rebels made it though. One of them appears to be that cyclist from sector seven. Really? How very clever of him. Ooh, I'd like to suck his brain dry. See what little nuggets he's got up in there. Find out who else is with him. It sounds like our men were asleep at the wheel. Any survivors? Yes, but all are badly injured, sir. Just a second. Oh, sorry. Just for a moment, I thought a hint of compassion for them might be crossing my mind, but I was wrong. Have them sent up to my lab. I'm thirsty for a mind shake. Yes, sir. And let's also get a small DT force after the rebels to keep an eye on them. They've come too far to be traveling blind. Something tells me they have that map. ♪ Hey, Deek. You sure that stuff's okay? Maybe we should wait till Adam gets back. Let him check it first. Ah, it's fine. Okay. Hey, Vike. You hungry? Yeah, it's good. It's fine. Yeah, good. Vike, Vike, don't! You can't eat that. It's poisonous. Sorry, Vike. It was an innocent mistake. Come on, man! I said I was sorry. Jada! Let me go! Let me go, you idiot! Ahh! You think that's funny? Oh, come on, Deek. What did you expect? You nearly poisoned the guy. Look, we're all going to have to work together, all of us, if we're going to make it to New Eden. You know, I'm sick of this. What are we doing?! There's no food or water. We don't know where we're going. We don't even have proof that where we're going even exists! I'm in the wind, losers. You're on your own. Don't listen to him. But what if he's right? What if there is no New Eden? What choice do we have? We can't do back to sector seven, can we? We have to keep moving ahead, Adam. Once we stop believing, we're finished. Remember what Grandpa said? The future begins with us. Yeah... The future begins with us. Why had I joined these people? They needed me. I didn't need them. But I couldn't get them out of my mind. [Groaning] [retching] Think he'll be okay? I don't know, Vike. I loved Grandpa. But I don't know if I even believe in New Eden either. He hadn't been out of sector seven in years. How would he know? I mean, what if we get to the next spot on the map and the information we need's not there. Then what? I didn't ask for this responsibility. I'm no leader. Feeling okay? Yeah... I'm fine. Fine. [retching] Well, I can tell you're happy to see me again. So I came back. And that night, as we went to sleep, I started to feel like I was part of the... Started to feel like I belonged. [Gasping and moaning] "Oh, yeah. So cool." "Totally awesomely cool, cool, cool." "Man, Lizzie." "You're so wired." "Yeah, it's me, Lizzie." "Yeah, it's your brother, Danny." "Keep cool, Lizzie." "I'm okay. Look, Lizzie." "Look how okay I am." "Sure..." Wha...! Yes? Ah... Sir, we have the information on the rebels you asked for. It looks like the cyclist is accompanied by three others and a dog. All from sector seven. Name of the family is Wesley. Tell me, Thorne, would that be William Wesley? William Wesley was their grandfather -- died a few weeks ago. Well, it looks like we may need to prepare for a reunion of sorts. It's going to be a mind-wipe marathon when I catch up with this group. "Oh, it's gonna be way cool." [Malevolent laughter] We knew the rock was out there, the map said so, but the middle lands all looked pretty much the same. It was weird not seeing anyone. The feeling grew and grew that we were being watched, but we kept going. We had no choice. Finally, we slowed down. We'd been traveling so fast, Jada was scared we'd miss what we were looking for. We did... but Kenji didn't. [Kenji barking] What is it, Kenji? What have you got, boy? [Kenji barking] Kenji found it! Whoo! Yes! Good boy, Kenji! Good boy. Good boy, Kenji. You see anything? Nothing. Well, keep looking. What you find, Kenji? Good boy! Yes, yes. Come on... It won't open. Come on. Here. Let me try. Let me try. Oh, yes! Thanks, Adam. No problem, Jada. Come on, read it. "Welcome friend." I think that's what it says. The writing's a little bit faded. "If you hold this in your hands, you've known where to look" "for help to find New Eden." Yes! "You must first go to Endgame," "two days march from here." "Ask Caesar. He will show you the way." That's it. That's all there is. What? No, there must be more. Look. Oh, it's a map. Hey, you guys! Hey, Lizzie! [Kenji barking] Hey, some welcome. What's with the dog? How'd you get here, Lizzie? Oh, you'll never believe it when I tell you. Never, ever. Hey, you guys hungry? I've got some really great stuff. Did somebody mention food? There. Genuine H2O. The real and precious stuff. It is so cool to see you guys. I mean, it's amazing. Uh, Lizzie, you said you had some food? Oh, yeah. Here. Eat up. On the house. Absolutely no charge. Not for my friends at sector seven. Do you want some, Deek. It's a bit old, but don't worry. I wouldn't eat the green bits, but the rest is just fine. So, Liz... how did you make it through the check point? I'll just put this out, eh? Don't want to give us away. Is that good, Vike? Can you believe it? Real tea. I traded it. That's part of the story. I got it from the DTs. You traded with the DTs? But you were scared they were coming for you. Oh, sure, but that was back in the sector -- When I got to the check point, I watched those guys for a while, and I happened to have a few things they needed. They're a long way out there and they feel neglected sometimes. So, I just talked to them, showed them the stuff that I had. Did a bit of trading and they let me through. You know me. [Kenji barking] Hey, keep him quiet. Sound travels out here. What's his problem anyway? He senses things. You know that, Lizzie. Yeah, I guess he does. He could be useful. Want to trade him? No. I was only kidding. Got you going for a minute. Do you see anything? So, what's happening? We think we've found out how to get to New Eden. Well, part of the way. It's real then. Yes, it is real. Wow. We found this just before you turned up. It's the next place we have to go to. We have to find someone named Caesar. Do you want to come with us? Oh, Jada, I'd love to, but I have to wait here for Danny. Well, maybe we can wait for him as well. He can come too. Well, I tell you what. Could you wait for me and Danny in Endgame? Just for a day, okay? [Kenji barking] He's not happy. There's danger. We should go. See you, Lizzie. See you, Deek. Bye, Adam. We'll wait for you in Endgame. Are you sure you want to stay, Lizzie? I can't disappoint Danny now, can I? You can't. Take care. See you. Dr. Kao: Lizzie? Yes? Lizzie? Yes, I hear you. And...? Yes, they have it. They have what you're looking for. Well, guys, the good news is, I don't think Endgame's more than a day or so from here. And the bad news is? Don't be so cynical, Deek. I wish I could've eaten that bread that Lizzie gave us. I'm so hungry my ribs are talking to my backbone. Don't worry, little man. We'll find food. Won't me, Kenji? [Kenji barking] He says yes. Well, I guess we better get going. ♪ Jada, come check this out. We should find shelter. ♪ Over there! Kenji. Good boy, Kenji. Hey, guys, look at this. Oh, wow. This stuff might belong to somebody. No, it's been dumped. Hey! Get your hands off that stuff. Who's going to make us? I trust I have made myself entirely clear regarding your brother Danny, Lizzie? Yes. Speak up. Are you deaf or just dumb? Neither. Don't play games with me, fire girl. Disobey me, and I might just find a use for what's in that hot little head of yours. Danny, Danny! I'm afraid your Danny's checking out. This is my turf, and you just walk right on in and you stole my food! Well, I'm going to make sure that you pay, people, big time! How could we know it was your food, we didn't think anybody lived here. Not good enough, and can you please stop looking at me? You're very ugly. Do what he says, Vike. He's off his tree. Did I say you could talk? Did I! Kenji, Kenji. Kenji, Kenji. Now... What did I just say? You just spoke to the dog. What did I just say? Would you take this dog please? Take it! Don't hurt him! "No, don't hurt him." No, mate, we're not going to hurt him. We're just going to eat him. What do you say, guys? Hot meal? Eat the dog! Eat the dog! Hey! Stop picking on the kid! We've got a hero. We like heroes here. They're so much fun to play with, right, guys? Yeah! Come on, mate. We're all just trying to survive. Well, it seems like some of us are doing a better job than others. Come on, just let us go. Guys? They want us to let them go. Should we let them go, hmm? Eat the dog! Eat the dog! Eat the dog! [Kenji barking] Somebody get rid of that dog! Would someone keep that dog quiet? Adam, pick the lock. Eat the dog! Eat the dog! Come on, you can do it. Not now, Vike. Vike?! Run! The DTs are coming! Save yourselves. I'm out of here! DTs! Look. Yeah, Vike! Okay, Fire girl. We've got a deal. Get the stuff. Lizzie, what are you doing here? The deal's off. This is for Danny. After them! Leave them. Get the others! They haven't seen us. Go, go! [Man screaming] I guess you're going to miss your bike, huh, Deek? Well, when we get to New Eden we can build another one. What say we build two, huh? Lizzie, that was so great. I never knew you could do all that. Let's just say I've been practicing. So, what are you doing here? I thought you were going to meet us at Endgame with Danny? Jada... I lied to you before. The DTs got me at the check point, and Kao had Danny, so he forced me to cooperate with him. I was supposed to help the DTs bring you in. Kao? Yeah, he's your worst nightmare. He runs the DTs and he's after you. He knows you have the map to New Eden. What? How? I told him. I had to. He has this terrible power over people's minds. And he had Danny, only... now he isn't Danny any more. At least, he isn't a Danny I can help any more. Please take me with you. Of course we will. They all escaped, Thorne, including the fire raiser. I'm sure you recall what I said would happen in a worst case such as this. Yes, sir. Somebody should call your wife and tell her you won't be coming home for dinner - ever! Come along. Hop up. Up, up, up. [Chuckling] Thorne, Thorne, you're as good as a weekend away. Your face just then. So expressive. [Both laughing] Enough now. I'm bored. One of the many differences between us, Thorne, is that I understand patience. The rebels are already on their way to me. They don't know it yet, of course. I would have hoped to have welcomed them earlier, but que sera, sera. Oh, anticipation. Such a pleasure in and of itself, don't you find? ♪ This is Endgame? Excuse me, do you know-- No, no, no, no, no! I have no knowledge! Ha, ha... What was the question? We're looking for a man-- Have a nice day. We'll continue this discussion anon. Lunch, lunch! Must eat lunch! Lunch! Lunch, lunch... Uh, excuse me. Do you know Caesar? Oh, yeah. We're looking for someone called Caesar. We were told that he lives here. Maybe I can help you. Yes. There's a good chance I can help you. Depending, of course, on what it is you need help with. I make no promises, and I make no bones about that. My name is Caesar, and I would be pleased to be at your service. Yes, I'm certain of it... I think. I can't be too sure. Please. No pressure, as I have a tendency to forgot things when I'm pressured. My name is Jada Wesley. We're trying to find New Eden. Well, have a nice trip. Send a card. No, no, no. I don't think you understand. We've come a long way to find you. We've been told that you could help us get there. I see. I see. Yes, well... Ahh! I've evaluated your situation, and in my best estimation, I don't have the slightest idea what you're talking about. Well, do you remember my Grandfather? His name was William Wesley. Would that be Bill Wesley? Yes. Never heard of him. Look, I'm an old man. I'm not very sharp any more. I'm approximately as sharp as I was this morning but, even then, that was nothing to brag about. Caesar, please, show us the way to New Eden. I really wish I could. You seem like people. And I don't have much else to do right now. I'm sorry. I, I was a different man once. Perhaps that man could have helped you. Would you like some tea? No. Oh, I would. I haven't had tea in years. Come on, Jada. Let's get out of here. This guy's nuts. Yeah. You know him, Vike? Good to see you again, my old friend. It was once a beautiful world, with a beautiful sky. I'm sorry you missed it. William told us there was a place near here where a part of that world still exists -- That's why we're here. Yes, yes. I remember now. The doctor stole most of my mind, but I held on to just a little piece of it. Please, come with me. Recognizing Vike had triggered Caesar's memory. We listened carefully, trying to make sense of what he was saying. He told us how the resistance had held out against the corporation until the very end; but Kao and his friends controlled the technology and all the resources. In one last desperate battle, Jada's parents rallied the rebel forces to defend the fort on the island. It was the last resistance stronghold. The rebels had built secret tunnels underneath the fort which led to New Eden. Some of them made it through, hiding the tunnel entrance behind them. Then Kao took over the island as his headquarters. The entrance is hidden, right? So how will we find it? Find what? The entrance. Oh, that -- Yes, well, first you must look for the sign, of course, to unlock the door and beware of the poison gas. Well, where can we find the sign? Can you tell me where the poison gas is? Would you like to join me for dinner? Yes, I'm sure my wife would love to have you, although I haven't seen her for years myself. No, Caesar, we're trying to find our way to New Eden. Don't you want to come with us? New Eden, New Eden... Never heard of it. Caesar was in his own world again, but he'd given us the information we needed to make it through the tunnels. We called out to him, but he didn't here. He was our last link to the past. Maybe it was kinder to let him stay there. The tunnels were beneath the island, right under Kao's nose. They'd been there all along. Okay, we travel light, we travel fast. Surprise is the key. I think I got just about everything Caesar said about the tunnels. Boy, that Caesar. So hard to understand. You did well, little man. Do you think what he said about the poison gas was true? Guess we're about to find out. Okay, so, once we're on the island, we're looking for the tunnel's entrance -- even if we get split up, okay? If any one of us gets taken, we agree the others go on. Okay? What we're doing here is more important than any one of us. Vike, can you do this? Deek? Liz? Adam? [Kenji barking] You too, Kenji. Okay, my friends, come dark we go. ♪ He likes you now. He wasn't exactly your best friend when you joined us. You stayed. You came all the way with us. You know we couldn't have come this far without you, Deek. You know, I'm glad we met. You guys, you take care of each other. You know, you trust each other. Is trust so hard? Yeah, for me it is. You'd think I could trust my parents... But they abandoned me when I was just a kid, went to work for the corporation. Just left me there alone. Well... maybe they had to. Maybe they thought that the best thing was for you to stay outside. Maybe they trusted your smarts. Do you think we'll make it? I hope so. I really do. We should get back. It's almost time. [Kenji barking] Hands up, hands up, hands up, hands up! Deek, go! We agreed! Save the others! Kenji, go, go! What about him? Leave him for later. Take her. Hey! They took Jada! What do we do? Find her. ♪ Jada was alone... right in the heart of Kao's lair. She wouldn't let them see how scared she was. All she could do was wait and try to plan... Wondering if we had escaped, hoping we were okay, trying to believe we'd find her. Out, all of you. Jada Wesley. You do look like your mother, don't you? You knew my mother? Oh, yes. Very well. Your father and grandfather too. That was taken in younger, sillier days. Oh, we were so idealistic. Eventually, I found their methods a little too soft. My ideas would have helped their cause, but they all thought they were too, I don't know, how shall we say... extreme. So, you just went over to the corporation? Yes. And I've been much happier since. I have to admit, I was quite fond of your mother. Can't say she shared my feelings though. I think she'd have made a great corporation leader. But enough about me. Let's talk about you. Oh, you're right, you're right. There's no hurry. I'll have someone in shortly, to get you properly set up. Then our fun can begin. Um, I don't suppose you'd like to talk about the map now? Would you? No, of course not. To be honest, I'd be disappointed if you had. I'd much rather suck it out of you myself. Make yourself at home. We've got a lot of work to do. Back soon. ♪ [Kenji barking] [Man groaning] ♪ Thorne, I'm sure you feel that now I have the girl, I'm somewhat sated, but I'm afraid that's not the case. No, sir -- I assume I'm still guilty of other unspecified failures and infractions. Oh, indeed you are, yes. There's still the cyclist and the others who were traveling with her. They didn't just disappear. Find them! Come along. ♪ After I finish with the girl, I'll want a mind-wipe night cap. And if it's not going to be them... I may finally have to call your number. Yes. ♪ Ahh! Come on. Stop! [Footsteps approaching] Go, go! [Sirens wailing] [Men groaning] [Punches landing] Come on, come on. I don't even know what I'm looking for. [Alarm sounding] Stop where you are! You're coming with me. Hands in sight. I said hands in sight. We've been expecting you. Sergeant, take the intruders to Dr. Kao. Okay, move. I said move! Ow! Oh! Do you think it's the right time for this? In your dreams, biker boy. Go on, find the girl now. Move! It's not here. Caesar was insane. He just made it up. Come on! Look! Jada! We found it! Jada! Let's go. Come on. Over there, over there! What's that? They've found the entrance to the tunnels. This way. Dr. Kao...? Sir? Which way? I don't know. Let's look. Come on. ♪ Wait! Lizzie?! Ahh! Vike! Oh, Vike, you're hurt! Get him up. Watch his leg. Get him up. Careful. Come on, Vike. You can do it. Don't forget the gas. Watch out. Adam, the gas! This way. We go this way. Keep moving. ♪ Hang on, Vike. Keep moving. Which way now? Easy, Vike. Adam! Where are you? Around here, guys. It can't be far now. Hang in there, Vike. Oh! Vike! Vike. Come on. you can do it. We're almost there. Yes, we are almost there, aren't we? Thank you, Jada, for leading us so keenly. I've found it. New Eden. The secret of the after time. Ahh! Vike! Vike! Vike! The gas. Vike! Ahh...! Vike! Vike! Come on, we've got to go. ♪ The sky is blue. We made it. We made it. [Kao gasping] [Groaning] ♪ I don't know if New Eden was what I expected. But that carving on the rock told us we weren't alone. For the first time since we'd left sector seven I felt really good about things. I looked at Jada and Adam and thought how proud Vike and William would be. And then I thought about my own mom and dad, and wondered if I'd ever see them again. If we'd made it to New Eden, anything was possible. At that moment, we weren't Doom runners any more. We were just a bunch of kids hanging out, having a good time.
