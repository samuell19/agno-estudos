Who has the keys? Javi, I think. Javi. Do you have the keys? I have them. Come on, we'll make another trip. Careful, careful. Come, little girl. Does it hurt? What? My stitches hurt. You exaggerate. We've all had stitches. It doesn't matter. What do you want to eat? Sushi, I want sushi. Have you been to the bathroom? - Ama. - Well, nothing. No way. Beans or porrusalda? Well... beans. And fish. Well, not to argue. Do you need anything else? Does anyone need anything else? Casserole dishes, I don't know where you have your casserole dishes. Casserole dishes. And the oil. Hey, it's hot in this house, Javier. Koldo, you have to go shopping. I'm not off the hook, I'm not off the hook. Hey, if you want, we can have some of that sushi. Let me know. I can come down if you want. I'll be down in a moment. Let's see. Let's see, I'll come down. You better finish assembling the cradle. Come on, I'll get the car and go. I'm going to set up the cradle, okay? Okay. I think he is hungry. Of course he is. - I can't get it. - Chiquitina, come on, let's eat. Come on, lazy. Ama, you're going to suffocate her. Stop. How am I going to suffocate her? Ama, stop. Of course. Eat, eat. Let's see. There. What? It hurts, doesn't it? I got horrible cracks. The midwife told me that they were cured by breastfeeding. That really hurt. Come on. Let's go. Mirentxu's son sends you a hug. He's been promoted, made branch manager. Almost all the bosses have had to plead with him. Yeah? He sends you his regards. He gets asked about you a lot. You see, how nice. And you, how are you doing at work, Javi? - I'm fine, very good. - Yes? All good, yes. - But you are working now, aren't you? - Yes. Well, I finished the tour a week ago because Ione was going to be born, but now I will see, well, we'll see how we organize ourselves. - Of course. - But good. It must be nice to be in the theater. Very unstable, too, but nice. The truth is that I have been lucky, Since I started working, I haven't stopped. - How nice. - It is fortunate, yes. And in the end I guess an electrician is always needed. I mean, without lights you wouldn't see anything. Ama, he is not an electrician. - It doesn't matter. - He is a lighting designer. That's right, sorry, son. - It's all right. - Designer. What's wrong with being an electrician? Nothing, I didn't say it was bad. No, not bad at all. But it is different. I am a lighting designer. What we do is, we create an environment with lights to tell a story... Eat, daughter. And do you travel a lot too? Have you thought about how you are going to organize child care? - This is delicious. - It lacks parsley. You didn't say anything about parsley to me. I told you three times before leaving. Sorry. So then, have you thought about how you are going to organize the childcare? Let them be, Begoña. That's up to them. - But I'm asking. - You're messing up. I can work from home. So, you haven't thought about it? Ama, don't worry. Me worry? I don't worry about anything. Only about the flan. I'm going to see how it turned out. I don't know what we will do without you when you are gone, Begoña. When you are not here, because this is... - Enjoy, Javier. - Thank you very much. How do you sleep here? With the head up and the feet down, I imagine. Good. Koldo, forgive me. I'm going to bother you for a moment because I have to... Of course. Take out the sofa. Practically no one has slept here. It's brand new. Some sheets, here are the pillows, and a quilt in case it gets a little cooler at night. A quilt, no, thank you, because this heat is killing me. But then it gets cold. - No. - No? Unless you want to kill me. No, man. Not to kill you, Koldo. - Then take it. - Okay, I'll take it. - See you tomorrow. - See you tomorrow, sleep well. See you tomorrow. Where are my glasses? Here. Javi. Javi. What? - Fuck, Javi, I'm calling you. - I'm sorry. Can you stand up? Here. Like this, with the head still. Watch out. It's just a couple of nights. Go to sleep. Guess who is here? Ione. Thank you, she's very good, actually. This room is impossible to ventilate. One month to come back? That's a long time, isn't it? How long did you breastfeed, Ama? However long the doctors were recommending at the time. And you weren't working? No, of course not. I didn't work. I think I'm going to stop breastfeeding. - Okay. Take her, Aita. - Come on, into the water. I'll get her. There she is. She could get burned. That is why the temperature must be measured. Let's see. Here it goes. Now it is. Your first bath. Here goes the lizard. Careful, Aita. Aita, you're going to drop her. - All done. - Watch her head, Koldo. Her head is fine! It's well bent. Man, she moves a lot. Come, Amaia, don't be afraid. But she's liking it and everything, I think. Very good. - There it is. - Very good, this little one. Did you see how well she did? Very good. Well, Ione, your first bath. Ione says hello. Look, say hello. I think you farted. Come here. You have the hiccups. Koldo. They need detergent and wipes. - Didn't we buy those already? - No, those were other things. How little stamina you have, boy. You're good for one errand, can't run two. - No, I can. - In the end, I'll have to go myself. Then go. Look, go. Go wherever you want! No, no! If I went where I wanted to go... Look, don't make me talk, Koldo! Speak, speak, speak! Speak, speak, speak. I'll take the suitcase right now and leave you here. There you go. Okay. Detergent and wipes. Yes! - Hello. - Hey, Javier. How are you doing? I'm just going to... Let him go. Tell him, my love. Tell him. Let him go. All right. That's it, Amaia. I left food in the fridge for you. Please eat it, lest it spoil. Don't worry. If you need anything, call us. - Okay. - And you, lizard... I have my eye on you. Promise. Come on. We have to go. You know how your father is when he's in a hurry. I don't know what's wrong with me. Well, everything, daughter. Everything's happening to you. Come on, honey. Calm down. Every day is a little bit better. Okay. We're good. See you later. Let's see. All right. That's it, honey. Yes? - Did she fall asleep? - Yes. Really? - All right. - Yes. - I'm going to bed. - Okay. If he wakes up, will you go? - What are you doing, Javi? - What? What was that for? It's nothing. - Fuck, Javi. - Nothing. I am the one who breastfeeds her every two hours. The one who is tired is me. The one who doesn't sleep is me. - I can't take it anymore. - I know. So don't sigh, damn it. Okay. Amaia. What? I just got a call from the company. They have a job for me. These people are crazy. They dropped the guy who was going to do it and called me. When? Now. Right now. Three weeks in Valencia. Three weeks? Yes, but it's good pay. Three weeks away from home? Yes. What do we do? Say no. - Say no! - Okay, I'll say no. Of course! Are you sure? Do you want to do it? - No. - Do you want to take it, Javi? - No. - Do you want to take it? I want whatever you want, Amaia, but it's a job. - I can't go saying no to work. - We have a daughter. If you had a normal job you'd have a normal leave of absence. - Or not? - Do you have a normal leave? - So now I don't have a normal job? - Is this normal? Telling me you're leaving for three weeks? - Amaia, please. - What? Are you going to work? I wish I would go to work and you would stay here, Javi. But you can't. - Is it not possible? - Honey, you can't. If you want to get a job, what the fuck are you telling me? Call. Let's call them. Let's get the fucking job. Amaia, please stop. Amaia. Why are you treating me like this? - Like this, how? - Like this, badly. Wrong! You said you don't have to give up anything to have a baby, people still do things, life doesn't change. Did you say that or not? Bullshit, Javi! You lying piece of shit! - You said that! - I'm a liar? Can you tell me what you want me to do? Nothing, Javi. I just want you to stay. - Okay? - Okay. We can talk about it tomorrow. We can consider. I've told you so we can consider. And that's it. I want you to stay. How beautiful. Do you go send him to daycare? Yes. That's nice. I want to do it soon. Because if not, I don't know how... I mean, I can't... At the beginning you pay for nothing. It's just that you have them at home all day. They catch everything. Hey, and which daycare center do you- Gonzalo, please get down from there, you're going to break your head! Hello, hello. - How was the trip? - Very good. How long will you stay? Through Tuesday. Hello, sweetheart. Very good. No. Softer. I learned about a day care center that seems to be very good. - There are no vacancies, but- - How much does it cost? We can wait for one to open. Very good. I don't care what it costs, Javi. Okay. - What's it name? - Colorín Colorado. Colorín Colorado. Are you amused? - A little bit. - Yes? Ione, honey. Yes, Ione, my love. This man is daddy. Hi, sweetie. I'll eat your nose. Goodbye. Amaia, where did you put the diapers? - What? - Where did you put the diapers? Javi, can I take a shower for a moment? Can I take a shower in peace? Don't worry, I'll look for them. Ione, please. You're on fire, my love. Fuck. That's it, Ione. Shh. Wait for me here. That's it, my love. That's it. Forgive me, my love. Taxi! Over here! Hi. He has a high fever. Anything else? He fell off the couch. Everything okay? Yes, thank you very much. Okay. Amaia, did you call me last night? Yes, I called you. Did something happen? Nothing. Ione has had a slight fever. Oh, my little girl, have you taken her to the pediatrician? Then keep her warm. It keeps raining here, sweetheart. Not a soul on the street. I think we are the only bland people who spend the winter in this town. Your father is messing around with the computer and I don't know whether to iron or not. Let's see if it dries up a bit. And Javi? Javi is in Gijón. Are you all right, sweetheart? What's wrong, Amaia? Nothing. What's up? Come, give me the child. And you, sit down. We are already home. We are already home. Well, who is here? My goodness, how she's grown! My god, she looks so pretty. How beautiful my granddaughter is, my god! - Where do I leave this? - Right over there. What a beautiful thing. How was your trip? Good? Good. Aita, can I help you? No, I have it. - Give me the lizard. - Are you sure? - She's dead asleep. - Come here. - Careful. - Gentle. - Watch out. - Come here. - Look, you'll see. - Let me see. Watch. What hair you have, daughter. - Ama. - Are you angry with the hairdresser? I'm not going to the hairdresser, Ama. - Why not? - I don't want to see people, okay? The hairdresser is people. - You're too thin. - I'm tired, Mom. My goodness! I'll fix this in four days, you'll see what I mean. It was left by Don Mirencho, his grandchildren no longer use it. Don't put it close to the wall. This house is very humid, you know. Ione does not sleep in a crib yet. Not yet. When will I feel like a mom? How old are you? Thirty-five. Thirty-five, where are you? - At my parents' house. - All right. At least you sleep in your bed. Amaia, what's wrong with you? Ione fell off the couch. - Off the couch? - Yes. But is she hurt, does she have any injuries? No. What a scare. You fell headfirst out of the cradle several times and speak multiple languages. Come on. Come on, woman. It's nothing, it's silly. Children fall, Amaia. Come on, help me with the bed. Did I really fall out of the cradle? Yes, several times. Aita, what are you doing? This? A video I saw on YouTube. An Australian doctor. It's to reassure her. Don't you see how it works? Sure, you're scaring her to death. How little faith Mom has. Since when do you watch YouTube, Aita? You little animal... Tomorrow I will show you a video. It's for gas, you can make a bicycle. A small animal, see. Look at Peché, go to Peché. Where is Peché? Peché is not here. Where is Peché? Go to bed. - No, I'll stay. - Where is Peché? Amaia, no. Go to sleep. What time is her bottle feeding time? Three o'clock. Well, I'm awake. Go on, get out. Look, Peché. All right. Amaia? Amaia. - He's already hungry. - I'm coming. Already. Amaia? Sorry. Hello! What a night. It's just that we're not in the mood for this anymore, daughter. And now I'm going to the bathroom. Lizard, we're getting thrown out. All right! Wow! The water festival. Hello? Hello! Who is coming? I'm here, Begoña. Look, Aita look. Look, Ama. He is going to have breakfast. Hi, sweetie. Come on, lift up a little bit and let me pass this way. Are you going to be long? We have to go to the bakery soon. Can I send an email Ama, please? We need to get a little bit of air. - What's Aita doing? - Aita has to go to get the fruit. What if he goes for both? In this house you eat at 2:30. - Good morning. - Good morning, Begoña, how are you? - Good morning, Begoña. - Carmen, how are you? - Well, very well and you? - Good too. I'm fine. - I see you're in good company. - My daughter and granddaughter. - I'll see you later. - Good to see you. Goodbye. What can I get you today? - Some anchovies from Boca. - Very good. Amaia, what brings you here? Spending a few days? - Yes, just a quick visit. - Good. As soon as she sets foot here, she's already thinking about leaving. - She speaks English so well! - Yes, well, it cost us enough. Hey, well invested. Can't you explain to them that you can't now? No. It doesn't work like that. Sweetheart, you're not a surgeon. - But what do I know? - It doesn't work like that, okay? - You can't tell them no? - No. I can't. I've been saying "no" for months. Too much of that and they won't call me anymore. It's just the impatience you have- Impatience for wanting to work? You just want it all at the drop of a hat. Okay, I want it all. Ask the Three Wise Men for it. - Bego! - See if they listen. I don't know why I tell you anything. I am trying to work. I don't have time, you won't let me. Iñaki? Bego, it's been a long time. I didn't know you were back. No. I'm not living here. One of my sons lives here. Of course. - But look at you, you're beautiful. - No. You exaggerate. You never liked compliments, right? No. Not really. - And this must be your grandson? - Granddaughter. It's a girl. Amazing, isn't it? Grandparents already. I have two grandchildren and a third on the way. How nice. Ama, let's go, Aita is waiting. - How is Koldo? - Fine, as always. - Well, goodbye. - Bye. Goodbye. - Can I help you? - No. - Are you sure? - Surely not. No need for that. Tell your father, go ahead. - Aita? - You scared me. Time to eat. - I'm coming. - Hey, what are you doing? I am- Let's see, do you remember those Super 8 rolls? Well, those. I transferred them first to VHS, then to DVD. Now to the hard disk, everything is already digitized. - Beautiful. - Yes. If someone comes out with a new format, you're going to go crazy. No, a new format. No, please. No, I've been doing this for months. Let's eat before it gets cold! - Come on, let's go. - Wait. Please don't tell Ama about this. - Why not? - Because it's a secret. She thinks I'm tidying up the office. - I left my glasses in the office. - Go get them. Begoña, I'm going down to the office for a moment. I left my glasses. No, Koldo, the food will get cold. -I can't see- - Ama, let him go downstairs. Okay. Yes, I'll leave them. Come on. You should leave your glasses on in the first place. - It's delicious, Ama. - Chickpeas again! That's the way it is. Legumes are good for digestion. Your daughter is constipated, so they're handy. - I don't need chickpeas for that. - You shut up. Obey. When your mother gets something in her head, you know? All right. - I burned myself. - You have to blow a little bit, Aita. These are bland, Begoña. - They don't taste like anything. - I like them. What a shame, man. Holy shit, Begoña. It's all right. Ama! Be careful, don't cut yourself. What are you doing? Do you want to cut a hole in the carpet or what? Stop. - It's just a plate, we have more. - It's not about the plate. Take it easy with the smooth surface because otherwise this is a horror. Come on, stop. I'll do it. Better to break a plate than a head. I once threw a can at your father's head, narrowly missed. The bad thing about throwing things is that you have to clean them up. I didn't remember that one. How would you remember? You were so little. All right. Hold it. What did Aita do to make you throw a can at him? He refused to pick us up from the pediatrician. It was raining cats and dogs. We waited until the office was closed. And in the end we had to take a cab back. Many times I've sworn to myself, "in 10 years I won't be here anymore." And look where I am. Let's see. And why didn't you leave? Do you think it's that easy to leave a four-year-old girl? You wouldn't have left me, though. Okay. Come on. And you, what's wrong with you? You will be happy. Promise? Promise me. What do you mean? You have to be happy. You have to be happy. - Who is coming? - I am. Javier. How are you Koldo? - All good. - That's good. - Come on, they're there. - This way? How are you doing? How are you? Who is here? - My little girl. - Hello! Let's see, what? How heavy is this baby? How big you are. How are you? - Good, how was your trip? - Fine. - How was your trip, Javi? - Hello. Very good. I saw the scenery and the greenery. - A marvel. - A blast. Yes. - Daddy has come to see you. - Yes, Grandma. Yes. She is so pretty. Shall we go to the park to play? Let's go there, take a walk. Let's go to the park. Why don't we all go? I have a lot of things to do. We're going out. Okay. - Let's go, Amaia. - Mm-hmm. It's very bad for me, it needs to be better organized. - Goodbye. - Yes. - Come on, let's play. - Bye. Okay. Come on, Amaia. - You feel like it? - Mmm. Shall we go for a walk? Finish first, if you want. Okay, no no. I'm going to get his things. Chiquitina. Do you want to take it? There. Amazing how she has grown. Watch out for this child coming. Can I take the car? The car? No, she's playing with it. Not now, okay? The politeness of children. I miss it. We pour this. Water comes before powder. It doesn't matter if it's mixed, does it? How many bottles have you made, Javi? Well, I don't know. In four months? Less than you for sure, right? - Sure, right. - Yes. But everything can be learned, you know. Careful, Javi, the car. Take the car, Javi. Fuck, man, I'm freaking out. - I don't even want to look. - Well, that's it, he snuck in. I've been telling you for- - Okay. - It's always the same. Could you ever do what I ask you to do? - Okay, stop. - That's what I want, to do as I say for once. Go get it. - What? - Take the car away from him. I'm not going to take the car away from him, Amaia, he's a small child. This is the jungle. He took our daughter's car. He's a little boy. - Take the car from him. - Just rip it from his hands? I'm telling you to take it, yes. Take it. Okay. I go, I get up, I take it out of his hand, I rip it out of his hand. - Shall I write it down? - No, I'm going, don't worry. Okay. Let's see, this car- Everything looks good. How the cheeses smell. I don't know if she wanted parsley. I'll get it, I'll get it. No, don't worry, Javier, ask Amaia. Yes, I'll ask Amaia. How much are the piparras? 1.10. - And parsley too. - Yes. Hello? Yes, this one looks good. Hi, how are you? Good. You're Begoña's daughter, right? - Yes. - Yes. Hello. - Javi. - Hello, how are you? - Nice to meet you. - He's a friend of my mother's. I didn't recognize you at first. Well, I had it easier. You look just like your mother. - Here she comes! - Look, Ione, a friend. Look at her. We are going to be late. Us too. It's lunchtime, you know. Okay, goodbye. See you later. See you later. Mom, we're here. If Javi keeps being so kind to your father, I'll end up strangling him. Today we saw that friend of yours, what's his name? The one from the park the other day. You mean Iñaki? Iñaki, yes. Who is Iñaki? Youthful romance or what? - What is it? - No... of youth no. Of what? We had a relationship about 30 years ago. - But 30 years ago you were married- - I was very lonely, Amaia. And married too, yes. How long did you say your husband is... "staying," or whatever? I don't know. Koldo, where did you say the mattress was? - Wait, I'm coming. - I looked around, but it's not here, is it? Aita, does he know? Yes. Of course. There is another mattress here. This weighs nothing, you take it. Wait, Javier, you can do it. - Hold on, let me get in there. - Watch the furniture. I get the idea now, Koldo, this is payback for our sofa bed, isn't it? What do you want, a hammock in the garage? It's only for a couple of days, Javier. I'm just kidding. Because that's what it's going to be, isn't it? Shh, don't make noise. This mattress, for fuck's sake. Javi? What? Why don't we separate already? What? - Why don't we separate? - What the hell are you saying, Amaia? You're there I'm here, you visit for two, three days and leave. It's just that we act as if we were separated. Amaia, we are not separated or any such nonsense. I just don't understand. Well, why not? Because I love you. Come on. My god, Javi, you have such a way of saying "I love you." Okay, can't I tell you that I love you? As if that would solve absolutely everything. "I love you." - Saying "I love you" is a problem? - It's not. - Are you fucking with me? - No, I'm not. No. "Don't fuck with me," that's how you say it, like it means nothing. Saying "I love you" and meaning it is super hard, Javi. I don't find it hard because I really do love you, really. Do you understand? - No? - I don't know. Well, that's too bad, because I do love you. I love you very much. Well, my family loves me and finds it hard to say so. It costs your family everything. So the problem is my family now. - No it's not. - It is, isn't it? They just have a hard time with everything. Well, maybe it's hard for you to see that we are already separated, Javi. But we are already separated. You just don't see it, you don't see it! Good morning, Begoña. What? Did you not sleep well? - No. - Are you sure? Thanks. Amaia doesn't like it at all. Let's see, I'll make the coffee. I'll bet you were a very obedient child. - Me? - Yes. - Why? - No? I was a jerk when I was a kid. What was Amaia like? Amaia? She hated helping in the kitchen. How about you? I was an obedient child. Tell me, today, honey, are you going to be good? I think this is your bus. Yes, this is it. It's leaving now, I think. Yes, what's your hurry? I'm not in a hurry. I got a call back from Colorín Colorado, the nursery, we have a place for September, if we want it. How? Because I called and got it squared away. We're signed up. You could have told me. If you want, I'll remove our name. No, I'm not saying that, Javi. I am not saying that. I tried to tell you. Koldo, do you remember that old song you always used to sing? Yes, I was quite the soloist. If I had clipped her wings, she would have been mine, and never escaped. But then she would no longer be a bird. But then she would no longer be a bird. And I, what I loved was a bird. And I, what I loved was a bird. How young we once were. Amaia. Little one. - Look, she laughs. - Are you a little clown? How sweet. It's amazing how she's growing up, it's unbelievable. Hey, how was Antxón's party? Good. Did Aita cook? Little one. So pretty. How beautiful! What about Javi? He left too soon, didn't he? - Has something happened? - No. No, don't say anything, Mom. What am I going to say? Maybe you can muzzle your dog, or make him calm down a bit. Lady, I've already told you I don't like my dog to be muzzled. Maybe you'd like him to be put down better! Where have you been? What do you care? What do you mean, what do I care? You leave me standing there. You were just fine. But when you leave, you should say something. I made a fool of myself in front of everyone. "Where is Begoña?" "I don't know where she is, she left!" I don't want to talk, Koldo! Fine, don't talk, just give some explanation. I don't understand this. I don't understand it, Begoña. What happened for you to go away and leave me standing there? It made me feel ridiculous in front of them. Why couldn't you just sing them a song? Go sing to them! Well, okay. That's it, stop. - What's up? - It's all right, Aita. It's all right. Amaia! Mom, Mom! What's wrong? - I don't know. - What's wrong? - I don't know. - Come on, what's up? - Aita, go get the car. - What's wrong? - Get the car, Aita! - I'm going. - Mom, I'll pick you up, come on. - I can't, I can't. I can't. I can't. Wait. Don't let my clothes get lost. This one is done. I'm going to put this one here, here in a bag. I can't take this off. Have you talked to Javi yet? Can he manage with the child at home? Yes, everything is fine. He doesn't know where anything is. Well, he can call me, right? He calls me and that's it. Don't worry now, Begoña, she'll figure it out. And the baby, don't let her come here, it's full of germs. Okay, okay. I don't like hospitals at all. I dislike them even more than you. I don't either, I'm very... If you're trying to reassure me, you're doing a terrible job. But this one is fine! You know... It's all brand new. It's very quiet, it's a little weird that way. Silence is fine too. - Right. - Right. When I met your father, he was a very quiet boy. And I thought, "how interesting." And then, it turned out that he couldn't carry on a conversation for 30 years. - Let's go. - We're done. Hello, Begoña, how are you? How are you feeling? Is it you? It is the effect of anesthesia, you gradually become more aware. - Be calm. - Okay. If you need anything, call me. - Okay. - I'm here. - Mom. - Water. - Thirsty? - Yes. I don't know if you can drink water now. Do you want me to call the nurse and ask her? Hello. Hello. How do you like my nose? Do you like my nose? It's very funny. What about my hair? Do you like my hair? Not the hair? Aita. No, not Aita. Johnny, do you like Johnny? Nice. - Nice. - And do you love us? - Yes. - Do you love us very much? Yes, I am very thirsty. Water. Okay, water. You want water. Wait, wait. Wait, I'll be right back. If you can get it under her, all the better, but- - What about this one? - She'll tolerate it. It's best to cause as little pain as possible. You can't always do that. But is it because of the pain? Not because there's something seriously wrong after what happened? No, it's because of the pain. Then, once she's done, you come here, you dump it out, rinse it well and hang it up again. Yes? That's it. Is that okay? - Yes? - Okay. Hello, Begoña. How are you doing? Well? Good, she may have a little bit of chest pain, from the intervention. Have you practiced abdominal breathing? Yes? Okay. Little by little, okay? Anything else, let me know. I'll come back and check on the wound. - All right? - Okay, thank you. Don't make me laugh, it hurts. Well, don't laugh. Oh, what madness. Did you bring me the book? Holy shit, I forgot, Begoña. The one thing I ask of you. Let's keep it peaceful. I'll ask the nurse for a magazine or something. - What? I don't like magazines. - Okay. - Mom. - What? - I'm going to go now, okay? - Sure, go, rest. I'll see you tomorrow at 7, and if you need anything, call me. - Rest. - No, you rest. Okay. Good night. Good night. Aita, you missed the visit with the doctor. It's going to be all right, Amaia. Aita, she did not tell us that. That's because that doctor doesn't know your mother. Go on, take it easy. Call me for anything, okay? Yes. - See you tomorrow. - Okay. Let's see. Let's see, what have you brought me? I don't see anything I asked for. This one? What do I want hairspray for? - Hello. - Hello. Thank you for coming. You're welcome. If you want, I can ask for a couple more days. No, it is not necessary. Today the man in the next room died. Really? Mm-hmm. Mom has told the nurses to be more attentive. It hasn't taken her long to make everyone hate her. Well, I like your mother. Why? I like her, not like you. I don't like you either. Hi. Hey, excuse me. My mother was here last night. - Were you in this room? - Yes, where is she? Well, I don't know. If you want, I'll ask someone, okay? How do you not know? Excuse me, her name is Begoña. Yes, I'm looking for the supervisor. Don't worry. Hey... Hey, excuse me, one thing. Sorry, hey... Do you know what happens, Begoña? The tests are like this. "They're like that, they're like this," but then you take us out in the corridor and we freeze. Oh, hello. Look, my daughter. - Don't worry- - The child is there. You're on your way home. I'm going home, yes, yes. But now, the room hot again. You have here the patients up and down. We're never in the room at all. Oh, be careful, Koldo. Almost there. Careful, Koldo, you're going to hit the girl, please. Aita, okay, that's it. One moment. I have it. Let me, really. Take Ione. We are finally at home. Ama, shall we lie down? - Yes. - Come on, let's go. I'll hold you, shift yourself. I am thrown by the stitches. Come on, Ama, we've all had stitches. What an ass you are. The good thing about this is I won't have to listen to your father snoring. That's right. Ama, the doorbell. Anything else, let me know with this, okay? And I left you a glass of water there. Do you want anything else? Tablets. I'll keep the pills, the doctor said it was better. What else did the doctor tell you? Nothing you don't know. Let's see, is there something that, I don't know, something that you would like to do, would have liked to do, haven't done yet, any of those things? Something like what? Well, something, I don't know, like going to India, for example. Or paragliding or something like that. No. I just want to be here. Complaining, scolding your father, the neighbor, the neighbor's dog, watching TV. Okay, well, that can be arranged. - Okay. - Well, that's it. Pass me the glasses, come on. And the book. This one? No, the one below. This one? Here. What are you doing looking at me like I'm the Mona Lisa? I am leaving. Here. Well, whatever, come on. Begoña. Begoña. Ama? Please go to sleep, I'm not going to die tonight. Ama! I can't. Oh, god. I can't. Ama, wait. Wait, wait, wait. Okay. We are done. - I can. - Okay. - Let go. - Okay. Quiet. It's just that I'm dry, and you'll drop it, watch out. - You're soaking all over my skirt. - Be still. Koldo, if you don't know... - Ama, what is it? - He just can't, your father can't. Okay, wait. Aita, here. - No, it's okay. - Take Ione. - Let's see. - Okay, out of the way. Get over there. Let's go. - Let's get down on our knees. - Wait. Okay. Need help? - Need help? - Hold my head. The head, okay. Are you sure? Slowly, slowly. Okay, that's it. Okay, relax. I have the water. Come on. Close your eyes first. That's it. Feels good. Aita! Give Ione a bottle, please! - Amaia. - What? Tell me. What? What, Ama? Oh, Ione. Aita! Please, give a bottle to Ione! Don't rinse them so much, you'll wash them out. You'll leave them tasteless. Oh, how disgusting, please. Let's see, do it carefully. It's okay, Amaia. It's full of shit. Like anchovies. They have stuff. But this is bullshit. Let's see? Don't take it. How do I turn it off? - Hang up. - But how? Ama, just hang up. Here? Here? Amaia. Who called you? No one. Well, "no one" speaks English. I don't know what I'm doing. What you can, sweetheart. You're doing what you can. What a fucking shitty life, seriously. What a fucking shitty life. Would you like to trade for mine right now? No brainer, let's go. All the lives you don't live, are always perfect, all ideal. But at some point you have to live the life you've been given, sweetheart. Which reminds me, that someone has to make the food. I'll do it, Ama. No, thank you. I'm sick of tortillas. Did you get parsley? No, I didn't. I forgot. We are off to a bad start. Look, this is very easy. See how it comes out in one piece. There. That's it. Hold the anchovy there, don't let go and that's it. Rinse and dry. Another one, look. If this one doesn't come out, you take out its belly. You open it like this and the thorn comes out. Okay, I'll do it, Ama. - I know. - Are you sure? Positive. Sit down. Are you sure? Positive. Good. Well, that's it. Good morning, Ama. Hello. Hello. How was last night? - Good. - Good? Okay. I'll be right back. Look at this! What is this? Watch. Ione, my love. It's all right. Let's go. Mommy is going to go make lunch now. Aita, please watch Ione. - What? - Aita, watch her, please. - Now? - Yes, now. What do you have to do? Amaia, the child is crying. She's coming. Amaia. What is it going to be today? - Hake. - Herring hake? Yes, last time it was great. - Yes? - I think it's best. - Hello, Glori. - How is your mother doing, well? Good. Well, little by little. Could I stop by later to see Ama for a little while, you think? Whenever you want. Whenever you want, Carmen. And a little bit of parsley. Otherwise she won't let you in the house. How are you doing? - Good. - Good? The little one! Your mother must be going crazy with her at home. Yes. You could lift anyone's spirits, chiquitina. Aita! Come. - What? - Take the child. What's up? - Amaia, no. - Aita, shut up. - No, come here. - No, I'm going, Aita. - Amaia. - No, I'm not! I'm going. Come here. Careful, Amaia. - Careful. - Give it to me. - Put that down. - You give it to me. Lur! Come on, Lur. Excuse me, look at me. Do you know who this is? It's my daughter's best toy, you know? Can you muzzle the dog? - Can you muzzle it? - Lur, let's go. Eneko, can you muzzle the dog or not? - Are you going to muzzle the dog? - Come on, Lur. Put a muzzle on the dog, dammit! Don't let it happen again! Do you understand? You hear that? Well, you already know. Aita, Ama needs to be given the medication. Go downstairs. No, you go down. I have to make lunch, okay? I don't know what medication to give her. I'm going. What is this doing here? This doesn't go here. You're moving things around on me. This goes here, in this drawer. Okay. What are you looking for, Ama? Tell me what you are looking for and I will help you. Be careful. Amaia, this is my home. Don't tell me what to do, please. In the notebook drawer. Thank you. Ama, two? No, that little one. We're done. Wait, I'll take the thorn out of your side. Okay. We're done. Come on, let's go. You're doing very well, sweetheart. Look at her, all grown up. All right. Old people cry a lot. Come on, Ama. They see death coming. Let's keep the peace, Begoña. Let's change the subject. Since when are we not allowed to talk about death in this house? Can we just not talk? Please. You've become so delicate! We're all going to die! Stop it, Begoña. And lo and behold, I'll be the first. Let's drop the subject, let's drop it. I'm the one who should be crying. Am I to blame for this? Because it feels like I'm to blame! Aita, stop it! Enough! Aita! I don't feel like eating anymore. I don't feel like anything anymore. Enough! Aita! That's enough. My love, look... Cinco lobitos had the she-wolf, black and white behind the broom. Five she had, five she raised, and to all five tetita she gave them. Come on. Ione, love, very good. More. What are you doing here? Aita, where were you? - Around. - Around? You could have taken your cell phone with you. Oh hell, I just went for a walk on the beach. Where to? At this hour on the beach? - Don't talk to me like that. - Don't talk to me like that. Don't talk to me like that. Don't do that to me. - Don't raise your voice. - I'm not raising my voice. Look, let's just go to bed. Tomorrow is another day. Another shitty day. Come on, that's it. Tomorrow will be another shitty day like today, and yesterday, and the day before yesterday. - Amaia. - Aita, tomorrow will be a shitty day like today, like the day before yesterday, and so on, Aita. The one inside too, Aita. What time did your father come home last night? Afternoon. I thought so. You gave him an earful. - Ama, I don't want to talk. - Don't talk to him like that. He has been a horrible husband, but a good father. What else needs to be done? Nothing, that's it. A kiss to daddy. Sing with me. Let's blow. What happened? I told you. You can't send that video to her father, Koldo, no. She burned her hand. Where is Ione? Here! - Where is she? - Where is Ione? Come on, let's do the song again for Javi, please. Very good. Good. Bravo. All right, let's go. - Did it look good? - It was very good. Hi, I just sent you a video of Ione's birthday. We have already celebrated and nothing has gone super well. We ate chocolate cake... And I know Ione misses you. Good night. When you're finished, because I've already prepared, you know. Okay, give me a minute. Begoña, whenever you're ready. Before I begin, I wanted to tell you that this is a surprise that I have been preparing in secret because it's a birthday, and this has no title because I didn't have time to put the title on it, but I'm going to put lizard stuff on it. Come on, I pressed play. You didn't bathe me in a faucet, Mom. Look how much you look like Ione. How tiny. Mom, what a brute you were with the spoon. Shut up. - Look at that look, you see? - Look at her, there she is. - Look how thin he was! - Look at the body he had. She loves it. Thank goodness I'm doing something right. It was about time. - Mom, look how pretty. - How beautiful. Sometimes you are happy and you don't realize it. Look how beautiful you are, Amaia. Your birthday, how old were you? - Seven? - Eight. Eight years old. Amaia. Why did you always cut my hair like that, Mom? I liked it. Look, Ione. - Be careful with the head. - The head is fine. - It's crooked. What a pain in the ass I am. Shall I play it again? Amaia, what was I like as a mother? What do you remember about me? I remember you were very tidy, you were always very busy. And I remember you weren't very affectionate, you got very angry if I did, I don't know, some mischief, or if I fell down. If I didn't say hello to your friends, you pinched me. Do you remember? But you took great care of me. I did okay. Bring me the pills, come on. Yes. - There he is. - I'm coming. Come in. Who is it? - Who is it? - We have a visitor. Who is the visitor? Hello. Are you burned? Let me. - No, that's it. Fuck, that's it - You've made a mark. - No, that's it, let me go. - Come on, cold water. You didn't tell me you were coming. - Better? - Better. Damn, that looks good. Glad you're hungry. This is coming right up. Mom, do we have to do this now? Yes, better now than ever. I still remember my mother. I didn't even know where the wind was blowing. I had to take a Valium to go to the funeral, I wish someone had given me instructions. You won't suffer less, sweetheart, but at least you know what the fuck you have to do. The house, the deed to the house, half of it is for you, the other half is for Rita. This is grandma's land, this is all yours. That's a lot. I'll leave all of them here. Wait. - Don't go? - No. Come, sit down. If I die, even if it's like grandma, you have to call emergency services, and don't insist on keeping my things. It's a hassle to go around picking up all that nonsense. Funeral in the church. Which one? Whichever is closest. But you're not religious. It's more comfortable. And I want to be cremated, no body present, those horrible things I don't want. Help your father. My father, what? What are you going to do with him? I didn't know I had to do anything with Dad. Last year he was home alone for three days and almost died of poisoning. He doesn't look at the expiration date of things. Don't leave him unattended, sweetheart. You'll lose him. Okay, I hadn't thought of that. A woman. Find a lady for him, someone from the village to come here. Two hours each day for cooking and housekeeping. Because otherwise he'll go crazy. You know that your father doesn't... He will die of grief. No, I don't think so. Even if he did, he wouldn't admit it, even under torture. What are we going to do without you, Mom? What are you going to do? Sweetheart... I think that's everything. I thought it was going to take longer. What a thing. We're done. Ione, let's go to the water! - Keep going. - To the water! Step by step, very good. Get the boat! Do you want to or not? Are you taking me back? Maybe. So you don't know. Yes or no, Javi? You bumped my leg. Don't make noise. - Are you all right? - I'm fine. What are you doing? Come. No, I'm going by myself. - You see? - Mom. Amaia. I'm sorry. Where is she? She went in her sleep. All the better for it. Call 112, call. An endearing and exemplary mother of a family, a caretaker of her home and yours, she would want you to stay together. Amaia, may you take care of Aita, as your mother took care of him. Faith can help us cope with this pain. - I am very sorry. - Much strength, Koldo. I don't know where I put the glasses. Aita, we can't stay much longer. Amaia, don't worry. Leave when you have to leave. Javi suggested Thursday. This Thursday? It's fine with me if it's fine with you. I'm going to hire a local woman to help you. I don't need anyone. It would only be for two days a week. - What's her name? - What do you care? If you're going to hate it anyway. Aita I will call you every day. Okay, just don't get mad if I don't answer. I'm not going to get mad. I'm not going to get mad, but if something happens. But what is going to happen? Nothing is going to happen. - Nothing is going to happen. - Of course. - That's it. - That's it. That's it. You be calm. Relax. Come on. Come on. Aita. Poor little lizard. Good morning, little lizard, come here. Come here. We're going home, my love.
