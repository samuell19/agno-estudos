Vips, whose origins are lost in the night of pre-historic time, have been recognised throughout history as the most powerful of all supermen! Their noble aim has always been to protect the weak from the oppressor! The first Vip who appeared on earth created the tradition that this breed is heroic, invincible!!! And marriageable! And through the ages the tradition has been unbroken until the time our story begins, when BaffoVip equivocated the word "Super" and instead of marrying a superwoman, married a girl from a supermarket! This marriage produced contemporary History's first two new supermen!!! Supervip!!! And MiniVip! But due to the mixed genes these two brothers bore only a superficial resemblance to each other!!! Supervip was handsome!!! Minivip!!! Well!!! Supervip was invulnerable!!! Minivip was!!! Supervip could fly at supersonic speed from one planet to another!!! Minivip could only manage limited flights a few feet from the ground! Whereas Supervip was the strongest man ever know on earth!!! Minivip was the weakest superman of all time! I c-cant d-do anything right!!! But he can do everything - everything! What's the matter Minivip, you haven't eaten anything or talked to anyone for the last two days? I want to be a superman - like you! But MiniVee - you are a superman even if you're not like me! Then why do I have this V, and these wings everybody expects me to be like you!!! And instead I can't do a super thing, not a single, solitary super thing! Come on, Minivip, I know some psychiatrists who might be able to help you! - When did it start? - What? - Whatever started. - Tell it in chronological order. Be as brief as possible, please! - Well, my name is Minivip!!! - This means nothing! And I've always envied Supervip. - Does it hurt when I prick? - Ouch! - Would you like to be a superman? - Tell it in chronological order. Yes, I would, but as a matter of fact!!! Say, ahhh - Ahhhh!!! - You're jealous of Supervip, aren't you? - Who is SuperVip, man? My brother. - Tell us about your Mother. - You hated your Mother, didn't you? No! I didn't! I loved!!! Tell me, do you ever hear strange noises. - Does this look to you like a dog or a superman? - A dog! Then why do you want to be a superman? I'm not - he's the one who does everything!!! I think your images are confused! Take a deep breath! - Are you his brother? - Yes. Alright - you can come in! The patient is exhausted! He needs a long rest and a complete change! I suggest a cruise! But it would be best if he covered up and travelled incognito. You see, we suspect it's the color red that excites him! Goodbye MiniVee! Try to enjoy yourself and remember: - Forget to be a Vip! - I'll try, SuperVee - goodbye! Hurry! The gang-plank is going up! So long, MiniVee! Be careful not to catch cold!!! !!! And keep the hat and coat on! You want to see what color my next dress is going to be - see!!! Oh, lovely!!! !!! A real sick green! IShoutsl. Oh no! We've hit a tunnell. There's one on every cruise! Well, hell-lo! (PANTING) Oh boy! I'm sorry, sir!!! Only passengers in costume!!! At this party! Good evening, Madam evening Sir! Lady or Miss? A mysterious woman, eh? A Vip!! Ladies and gentlemen, attention please, an exciting event! We have among us a genuine Vip, a fascinating fantastic man who comes, perhaps, from other planets! A mysterious legendary being who flies in sidereal space, invincible, invulnerable, he can go through concrete or steel as if they were butter! Here he is, folk, a big hand for THE VIP! Those who want his autograph line up on my right! However, before interviewing the wondrous Vip!!! - Blood's running to my head!!! - Oh, sorry!!! We'd like him to give us a small demonstration of his renowned invulnerability!!! We're going to ask him to swallow this stick of dynamite and let it explode in his stomach!!! Squeamish ladies or those with weak hearts are requested to leave the room!!! All set, Vip? Come on, stupefy us! You saved my life!!! How can I thank you!!! That roar sounded real!!! A carnivorous lion! Helppppp! Holy mackerel, that water's cold! I wonder!!! If it has teeth!!! How many teeth do you have? Ah!!! You should have told me at once, that you were a second hand lion!!! - What were you doing aboard the ship? - Ghieghen din ghighen din ghieghen din den den!!!! Oh - you like dancing, eh? I like it myself, you know! But I haven't found the right girl!!! !!! The one I love, I mean!!! And maybe I'll never find her! I'm good for nothing! Here is the latest new!!! A Vip, one of the famed supermen has disappeared from the ship 'Annabella' while cruising in the Pacific! The Vip was last seen as he jumped through a port hole and it is now assumed that he fell into the sea! MiniVee! Fish don't bite at this hour! Got it?! Let's see, now! This is the route, yesterday it should have been here! I hope I can get there in time! A fish? Leave it, leave it! Still there? Maybe it's asleep!!! It's the first fish that ever smiled at me! Never mind!!! Well!!! It's means that I'll have to cut your tail!!! Uaaaa!!! Uaaa!!! Uhhh!!! Uhhhhhhhh uh uh! Not a sign of a ship!!! MiniVee! This must be the spot!!! But there's no trace of him here!!! Hallucinations are beginning!!! I'd better write a message!!! "Dear, whoever reads this, we need water and blankets and a motor! Yours truly, MiniVip!!!" Go and do your duty! This is the way to start a day! - Uh!!! Uh!!! Uh!!! Uh!!! - If you're asleep you don't catch fish! Land - we're saved! I can touch bottom! Let's get out!!! Next time it will be your turn!!! To save me! Well! It seems quite a nice island! MiniVeeeee!!! MiniVeeeee!!! Now let's count - the odd one out, goes to look for food! One, two, three, four, five, six!!! Sorry, six always loses! While you're gone, I'll get the fire ready! How the hell did they get to light the fire with two sticks? O! K! O! K! It will catch in a minute! Uh - uh - ahhh! Suffering Toledo! Why don't you try to help with the fire instead of making such a racket? Uh - hu - uh!!! Wh - who - who are you? First commander for spies elimination! Marsc!!! One two, one two!!! One two, one two!!! There's something down there!!! It's from MiniVee - he' s still alive! One two, one two!!! Stop! Get into the car! Wake up microbe! Move you slacker! Yiiiiii! Fasten your seat-belts and no smoking! - Have you got a driver's license? - Shut up - you flying shrimp! Ha-ha-ha! Fire, fire, fire! Ach! It's you! I didn't recognise you! Shultz, you idiot - for an excuse to fire that gadget you'd shoot your own grandmother! What has my grandmother got to do with it? THIS time I'm gonna report you to Happy Betty! Blast you! Blast you! Bis teine deworchen! Feuer! Feuer! - Who is Happy Betty? - She's the smartest woman in the world! She owns the H-B Supermarkets, 15,000 of them, all over the world! R! Vip! Please, don't leave me!!! Look!!! I'm not a lion! An island! An abandoned dinghy!!! And a trail! He' s there! Hooray! It's O! K! MiniVee, I've got you, we can go home now! No! No! My friend, she isn't a lion she's a girl! She's been kidnapped, I must save her! Tell me again, Confucious - who am I? Ichantsl Happy Betty, the super Supermarket Queen who's super-super. brains are supersuper keen! Smart boy, Confucius! Have a pep-pill! Ha! Colonel's coming back! You - down there! Look out, here comes Colonel. You'd think by now he'd know how to use those brakes!!! Stupid fool! It will be dark in a few minutes, then we'll have a look around for Miss Lion! No! You cover me, while I look! After all, she's my friend! Let's not start that again, MiniVee you know!!! You're not cut out for rough stuff! When it's a matter of power let me handle it! He was there, right behind me in the car, with the lion!!! Then poof! He disappears! If that description is right he can't be anything but a Vip! Hmmmm! I don't like it! I don't like it at all! The shareholders committee are due tonight and!!! I don't want any slip-ups! Tell Schultz to increase security! What about this lion? "Lock him in the tower; he might be useful for an experiment later!" Are you afraid of that little Vip? Afraid? I'm not afraid of anybody! Now get going! And don't forget who I am! - Super brains!!! - Shut up! Up there, go on, move! One two, one two!!! One two, one two!!! One two, one two!!! And if you try any funny stuff, you'll end up bald-headed! Come on, boys! I promised my wife I'd get home early! Don't fly, MiniVee, they might see your infraglow! Midnight! And we wish you happy dreams in your Happy Betty pyjamas! If that's the man who was taking you to Happy- Betty, he should be wearing the H-B badge! It's him! He's the one! The one who drove the car! Then the girl is sure to be somewhere near! Look out, SuperVee, a helicopter! At last, it's the shareholders' committee! Quick, go and meet them! Happy Betty extends you all a cordial welcome! - Bon-jour-Good evening - Salve. - Buenas dias - Chee-hi. I better hurry! Wait here, MiniVee!!! I'll go in trough the window, get the girl and come back! I want to come, too! Please, MiniVee, let's not start that again! Feuer! Feuer! Feuer! Feuer! Feuer! Zuborneit! Verboten! Fahreneit! What in tarnation is going on? I have heard a zibilant noise like the hizzing of a snake and I have pulverized and disintegrated it! It was a very small man like an inzect, and with two red eyes which zent out flames! You stupid! Miss Lion!!!! Miss Lion!!!! Incredible! Everything is going according to plan! Only a matter of hours now to demonstrate the experiment! But that Vip business makes me nervous! Get the projection ready and tell the Committee!!! That Happy Betty will join them shortly! I wonder where is she!!! Maybe upstairs!!! Mother! There's a Vip out here! Well, well, what an interesting visitor! Can I get you something? I'm looking for a lion!!! Hmmm, lions!!! Lions!!! George, have you seen any lions around? - Not recently! - Sorry! - Thanks anyway! Goodnight! - Goodnight! Did you see him, George? A Vip! I must tell Mrs! Martin right away!!! Mrs! Martinnnnnnnnnn! Ssssshhh! Aaaahh!! I heard once more the zibilant noise!!! Something fishy going on up there! - Oh! You are a girl!!! - You scared me! - Sorry-I guess I should've knocked? - Another Vip? Who are you? I'm Supervip - Minivip's brother!!! Uh-huh! There's a definite family resemblance!!! But what a difference in physique! That will make an interesting point for my thesis! - Thesis? Uh-huh! I'm an anthropology major and I'm doing my thesis on Vips! That' s why I followed your brother when he jumped off the ship!!! I wanted first-hand information!!! Then I got into this crazy situation!!! By the way, where is your brother? Minivip? Oh, he's waiting outside in a safe place! Ztrange!!! Very ztrange!!! An overturned tree! Thig iz very Zuzpicouz!!! Goodnight! Gentlemen, we are all aware that the most important factors of modern times!!! Are advertising and publicity! Now I have found a way of harnessing them!!! By an ingenious method which will give me single-handed power over international markets! Gentlemen, you are about to witness the birth of the brain-missiles! Colonel, get the Professor! I am hungry!!! You'll eat later! Right now, show these gentlemen the results of your research on man! Start the film! This is man! Trough a slow but inexorable process he has been "absorbed" by civilisation which has transformed him into a different being! Here is man as he is now, who because of the progress of our mechanised civilisation, has become almost completely automated! He crosses the road to the signal of the traffic lights!!! He gets up to the alarm of the clock. When raising his glass he says 'cheers' And when insulted his reaction is always 'who do you think you are'! The physical structure of human body, both internal and external! The substantive difference between the two consist in this: If, when viewed sideways, one of the two ossesses curves, that one is the female! The main parts of the human body showing residual activity are four: The right hand, the right foot, the eyes and the mouth! The right hand is to signal, to pull levers to sign checks, and push buttons and to carry out actions of public utility! The right foot is to exercise pressure on the accelerator of a car! The ideal man of the future will be born with two right legs! Eyes are for looking at television, movies and highways! Intellectuals also use them to read book covers! The mouth is used mainly for smiling and smoking! Those who use it for speaking become politicians! Those who don't use it at all become subtle humorists! Internally man is very simple! He has a few organs, all numbered, whose job it is to become diseased! The most important organ is the heart because without it, it would be impossible to tell whether a man is dead or alive! However, the most important result of my research is that this automated life has caused a partial atrophy of the brain! This organ that yesterday was considered the most important of the human body has now almost totally disappeared leaving a considerable empty space in the skull! But I had a different concept! A small missile, with an electronic remote control receiver, operating on one single wave length controlled by one person only, can be launched into men's heads! The impact is so sharp as to be painless! Its immediate effect is to wash what's left of the brain and eliminate any residue of hostile or wicked thoughts! After that, it enters an active phase in which orders sent out on the same wave-length will encourage man to harbour only feelings of fraternity for all living things, whether human or animal, - thus giving man a new possibility for!!! - That's enough! Colonel, take him away! I am very hungry! With a little!!! Encouragement, I 'persuaded' the Professor to make some slight modifications in the missiles using the local island inhabitants for our initial experiments!!! My next test was a sample launching on the people of South Coniferus where I have two markets!!! The impact of the missiles was timed exactly to the release of the supersonic notes of the activating theme song containing the control message! The control message, gentlemen, which I and I alone can send is!!! BUY FROM HAPPY BETTY! Let me tell you, gentlemen, in under two hours those people bought both of my super supermarkets completely empty-for cash! Now I have a new rocket ready for my first major launching of thousands of brain-missiles to the Continent, and after that, others, larger and still more powerful, will follow, until saturation point has been reached and I control the buying power of the entire world! But to complete this colossal operation will be costly, and that is why you are here, for the present I need financial support! Well, gentlemen, what do you say!!! All this is very interesting, Madame, but how can we be certain that the missile will, in fact, be effective on every individual? Before we invest in this project we must be sure that the brain-missile can work effectively on superior individuals, not only on mediocre ones! After all, for the average individual, television, radio, and movies works well enough! That's correct! He's right!! He's here, Happy Betty! It's him! The Vip! Catch him! The Vip is my answer to your query! I have him here for a final experiment, to satisfy your doubts!!! Colonel! Get Schultz and find the Vip! I want him alive and I want him quick! Get me out of here! Come out of there, you stoop, and help me find the Vip! Put on your pants, stupid and go search the tower while I look in the underground passages! Listen, Miss Lion, would you like me to take you out? What a question at a time like this! Of course, I would!!!! I mean if I were someone else, would you go with him? Come on, Supervip, let's go!!! Don't be childish!!! He's not here!!! Yah, up here is everything normal!!! Halt! Feuer! Feuer! Feuer! Feuer! Verdampte Vip try to hide, he? Dressed as a mouse, eh?!!! Very clever, Vip, Yah!!!! I'll be ready in a minute, SuperVip! Achtung! Vass ist das? I hear voices!!! Ya, ya, Ich feuer nachforsehen! Ach! Stop, stop, stop! Gee, Miss Lion, I bet you're the most beautiful anthropology major in the world!!! My name is Lisa!!! !!! And my hair must be a mess! Lisa, your eyes are like sparkling Jewels!!! Supervip!!! Listen! I hear something!!! Ich du fortasse kleine Vip! Let's go out on the terrace and look at the stars!!! Don't be silly! There's no terrace on this horrible cell!!! There isn't, well, I can fix that!!! There you are!!! Wonderful, isn't it? - What? - The peace and quiet! We are those who represent progress. We don't mind being fools nonetheless! Hurrah! Hurrah for the advertising atmosphere!!! We, with a missile stuck in our head. Nothing but Carousels we watch like mad. We put tiger in double soup!! Two blue drops into off-white! Great cook in your engine, durum wheat!!! Wash the dirt into bright! I've been waiting such a long time for you!!! I knew you'd come for me!!! But I never thought you'd be so handsome!!! - What's your name? - M-m-Minivip, what's yours? - Nervustrata!!! - Nervustrata? Don't you like it? Oh yes, yes I do, it's a lovely name! But why are you kept in there? See this thing in my head? I've been used by these awful people as a Guinea pig for their experiment!!! And it hasn't worked very well on me!!! But it doesn't look bad on me, does it? - You're beautiful! - I am? Then you will get me out of here, won't you? Hmm!!! Well, certainly!!! At once!!! It may take some time!!! Though, but don't you worry Nervustrata!!! I'll get you out of there, that's for sure! Oh! But Minivip, you don't have to cut the bars! I can get through them, see!!! - But!!! But!!! Then why? - It's the jump that frightens me! It's dangerous!!! But if you could catch me!!!? Whooops! What huge muscles you have, Minivip! I'm so weak, Minivip, I need protection!!! And you're so strong and virile! Don't you think we make a good couple? Marvellous! - So you're the strongest man in the world, eh? - We-ell!!! I knew it! I was sure it would be you! O! K! Let's see who's the strongest!!! Come on, step forward!!! Don't hit him too hard, Minivip, he's got a long way to fall!!! Come on MiniVip! - Oooohh!!! You're super Minivip! - No! Super's my brother, come on!!! Let's go! Supervip! Help!!! That sounded like my brother's voice!!! Wait here a minute!!! Who's there? What do you want? You!!! I mean the little you!!! Vip!!! The big one!!! In the cellar big one!!! Small one!!! Anyone!!! Vip doesn't matter!!! I'll kill any size! Sorry, I thought it was my brother! Hah! You little squirt! I've got you! Na-aang! - Let him alone! You big bully!!! - Now it sounds like a woman's voice? Ha! You wriggling super-worm I'll squash you for good! Do you mind letting go of my brother! Minivip! You were wonderful!!! Wasn't he, sir? He certainly was but he shouldn't have come in here!!! And the next thing to do is to get you out as fast as we can!!! I'll take the girls to a safe place and then come back for you! Safe place? Where? To the beach! No-one will look for them there! - The beach, huh! - Come on, Lisa!!! All set girls!!!? We're off! This time I'll get him! - There, girls! Safe! - Oh, take a look at the sea! Beautiful, isn't it? So many wonderful birds!!! Look!!! A butterfly!! What beautiful colours! Stay close, young lady!!! You'd better be careful!!! Never mind, sir!!! I'll stay nearby! Such a cute butterfly you are!! Hmm, yes, that should be a safe place!!! Whooops! What's going on up there? - Help! - Yes, help!! IchantslHappy Betty, the super Supermarket Queen! Hey! Look who's here! Colonel! Schultz! Somebody, hurry! I caught him! So hot, isn't it? No wonder! With that costume you have on! You know what I'm gonna do? While waiting here for you, I take it off and go for a nice swim! Do you mind, SuperVip? Not at all, just be careful not to swim too far out. Don't be silly! I swim like a fish!!! Especially without such a costume on! SuperVip, what's going on? Are you all right? Lisa! Lisa! I love you! So? Well? Lisa? Lisa? Lisa? Lisa? So? Oh, SuperVip, I love you too! OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO OOOOOHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!! Ha ha! That must be him! As promised, gentlemen, I have captured a Vip, the Superman of Supermen! Schultz! Show the gentlemen! - Incredibile! - Wonderful! - C'est vraiment lui! - Diablo! - Non I'avrei mai creduto! - Mein Got! - You have forgotten who I am! - Happy Betty the Super!!! However, before carrying out the experiment on him which will prove to you that my invention works perfectly even on super-brains, I would like to show you something unique! Gentlemen! You are about to see missile base 'Happy Betty' Ready?! Come on! Pull! And this, gentlemen, is only the outside! In a moment we'll have a brief tour of the works! Schultz! Take Vip to the experiment room! Alright, gentlemen, let's go! Yaaaaooohhhh!!! Hello, my name is Nervustrata! Don't be afraid!!! I won't hurt you!!! What a lot of lovely flowers there are!!! I wish I could pick them all! Here it is, the marvellous small steel city where the consumer destinies of future human generations are forged! Its working population is one hundred thousand strong! A Million six hundred thousand fingers working incessantly at our great project! Excuse me, you mean: ONE million Fingers! I mean what I said! Our bio-electronic laboratory has been able to create - collaborators with an eight-fingers hand! - Marvellous! And how do you manage to discipline such an enormous work-force? By taking advantage of the most modern methods of industrialization, and safeguarding each individual's personality! For example, after deducting part of their wages, we provide meals for our collaborators! Not the usual fixed menu, but a free choice! Butter! Each guest can have his grain of rice with either butter, ketchup or onion sauce! Ketchup! Furthermore, we see to it that our collaborators get a good relaxing rest! After deducting part of their wages, we allow them to use an apparatus which gives immediate, deep and healthy sleep! When, after a few minute of such special rest, our collaborators wake up, ready to go back to their work, they are conveyed by mechanical means to avoid loss of energy! The collaborators have some way of entertaining themselves? Why yes! After deducting a small sum from their wages, we offer them the use of a Park specially created for them with a particularly gay atmosphere!!! Where the collaborators can instantly satisfy their various and varied er!!! Venal appetites! - What about vacations? - Short, intensive, exciting, healthy! Our collaborators are given the opportunity to see the most beautiful sights in the world! While international artists sing and dance to their local music!!! There is also special apparatus to provide sun-bathing!!! And for local 'souvenirs'! - Do you provide medical attention? - Of course! No bureaucratic delay or lack of interest here, attention is immediate and categorical! Each illness is tackled decisively and rapidly carried to its solution!!! Supervip, now let's see if you can swim! SuperViiiippp!! Heeelllppp!!!!! OH! SuperVip! You're wonderful! You saved my life! This time you're not getting away! SuperVip! Watch out! Come on, good looking, I'll let you in too! And then this handsome man named Minivip. Came along and rescued me from prison! Boy, you gotta hand it to Happy Betty! If you please, Miss, step right in!!! And now for some maximum security measures!!! Phew! That's that! Now we'll proceed to the production area! The supporting part of the missile is plunged into a fusion at 1,400?! When the arm of the special expert in charge falls off, we know that the temperature of the metal bath is correct! In another department the missile undergoes a test for heat resistance! The technician after swallowing a mixture of gasses proceeds to the rigorous test! Unfortunately, we lose one match at each test! This custom of bowing causes a loss of approximately 15 percent in productivity!!! On the other hand, the problem of going to the wash-room has been brilliantly solved! As you know, gentlemen, this arbitrary and uncontrollable break in the work pattern is of capital importance in a large plant, and our research department has solved it by strategic placement of a running generator, which stops from time to time giving out charges of 60,000 volts! This inspires our collaborators not to waste time and prevents them from lingering longer than necessary! Wunderbar! If we had had something of the kind at the time, perhaps we wouldn't have lost the war! Phew! That's that! To return to the actual making of the missile! At this point, the electronic brain, produced in cans by a secret process, is grafted on the missile-head!!! And the whole thing is thoroughly sterilised! After which it is ready to be fitted into its final shell! The brain-missile are then taken to the great rocket which can house up to 15,000 and which is ready on the launching pad! When the rocket takes off, goes up !!! The small missiles detach them and by means of the electronic eye are directed automatically towards the people on all continents! This rocket cannot be picked up by radar, because it is motor-less! Ninety specialised collaborators, who pedal with all their might, activate a propeller which projects the rocket into space! The first rocket in history to work without a carburant! And now, gentlemen, let's go back to our friend, the Vip and to his new gold-plated brain! Look at it carefully Vip! See, we had your name engraved on it! Get ready, Vip! One two, one two!!! I caught the Vip O! K! I've got him locked in the safe! - See! - Be quiet, you idiot! I captured the Vip, not you! Heellpp! Stop him, don't let him get away! Catch him - quick - quuickk! - Gosh, it's dark! Where am I? - Ohh! At last! - I see a lot of little hearts!!! - Supervip! Get us out of here! We are locked inside a safe! Inside a safe? Where? Why? How did we get in here? Listen to me Vip! This is Happy Betty speaking!!! Running or hiding won't help you!!! The missile will reach you wherever you are!!! For the simple reason that you are the only one on the Island without special protective cover! All the others are safe!!! Inside our base!!! In a few seconds the missile will be firmly planted in your super square head!!! And you'll come meekly back here asking me for instructions - ha! Got it? See you soon Vip! O! K! Girls, don't worry, I'll get you out! That's it! Man, what a kiss! What a kiss! Wow, my head! I see hearts whirling around!!! Mmmhh! What a kiss, boy! Oh boy! Oh, oh! Next time I better send it to you by telegram! Oh good, here's my suit!!! And my belt! It was Minivip who saved us all from those terrible men!!! It was, wasn't it Miss Lisa? - Minivip! Were is he? - Minivippp! If I were you!!! I wouldn't worry too much!!! Up to now, he seems to be doing fine!!! All by his mini-self! Hmm, you might be right!!! Maybe I've underrated him! But then again, maybe I haven't! I'd better reconnoitre and make sure! Minivippp! Let him alone!!! Well, you atomated banana, are you through? - How was it? - A little too bony, but not bad! There you are, gentelmen! Success! This signal indicates that the missile has hit the target and now even the invincible Vip has become one of our "devoted clients"! Hmm, yes, very good, but I think rather it should be under our direct control? Intolerable insolence! You seem to have forgetten who I am? Happy Betty, the super!!! The supreme rocket will be launched in a matter of minutes! There is no time left to discuss stupid and useless controls! You'll have to make up your minds right now!!! Well? O! K! We agree! Congratulations, you made the right decision! Colleagues, slaves, worms! His is Happy Betty speaking to you to announce that the count-down will start in a few minutes! When our creation starts lifting itself into the sky advertising will become a PURE science! Posters, film and radio commercials will be useless because there will be no more doubts on the part of the consumer as to what to choose they will forever buy only Happy Betty products! After this rocket, others, increasingly powerful, will follow, because a cartel of international shareholders has now decided to finance my colossal project! - Long Live Betty!!! Long live!!! - Clear the launching pad! The count-down will start at once! Hurry, Minivip!!! Hurry! Do you remember which was it was? That way, no, that way no wait, maybe!!! Ten!!! Nine!!! Eight. - Seven!!! - I must find it! Six Five Four Three. - Good! Here it is! - Two!!! One!!! Zero! There you are, this way it won't bother you any more!

No, it's something even more powerful !!! It's love!! Are you really a superman? You know, Minivip, you're wonderful! Without your help that fellow!!! Would have been killed at least twenty times!
