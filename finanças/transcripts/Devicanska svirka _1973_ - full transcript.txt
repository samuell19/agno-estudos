I'll be with you as long as you need me. - Oh, Lord what is with me? - You need air. Can I open the window? Oh, no, I'm al right. Forgive me... There were pleasant days here. This was pleasant house...once... It wasn't so quiet... Can you hear? The silence... Man has to be silent. My name is Sybila. I live alone. Often, I lay my head in my palms. When there is no where to go... And I would come... I would go so gladly... Even to death... ...to death. That?s all about that! That is so bird like! If you only knew how cruel am I... No kids, nothing... I had a husband... I don't know what was in his head when I was talking to him... When I was telling him same what I tell you... He was laughing... His face was serious, but his stomach... That stomach was shaking... Do I look like a bird? Like that... I was faithful to him. I didn't want to be humiliated as one that humiliated me. You can't kill a man... You can take his joy... I knew how to respond to him... But I rather kept my silence... Let that go with water... For revenge... Though crawling... I got my music... Those sounds... What was that music? What was... Can dead ones raise before angels trumpet sounds? I live like that, like in dream for whole eight years... I shouldn't wondering... At the cemetery trees howl so that it could keep in sound sleep ones... that want to be awoke so much... - You are here... - I'm here - That is good... - I'll be with you... Thank you, Ivan... Forgive me, Ivan... Forgive me... That music... From where is it? That is love. Would you like to hear it better? Yes! Take me! I keep memories of my husband right here. Everything is same as than. Except death... Why running when it is so close... Close to love. I know that death is stronger. It could destroy her but it can't hurt her. - Do you want to find out about it (music)? - Yes. You'll find out. I promise. At the end. - At the end. - I don't want end! The end is beginning and beginning is the end. I love you, I love you. Ask me! I can answer on any question, but I rather keep silence. - I didn't want to ask... - But why? Please ask... If anyone should kill me, why wouldn't that be you? - Me? - You shouldn't look at me so cleverly... You know where my heart is. Please... Don't talk like that... You can do anything you want. But you have to know... I didn?t' hug you just like that. I really loved you. Ivan, tell me the truth... Could you kill me? Every year they fly over us... But only for one night and we wait... - There is one more secret. - What? Listen... That is secret. Virgins secret. It is above love. It's like death... It's stronger. It could destroy her but it can't hurt her. Hug me firmly so I won't shout. Hug me! - Would you like to find out her secret? - Yes! - You'll find it out. At the end.... - No. Now. Now! - You are starting to thing about everything. - Be quiet. Please. Even if you haven't come back, you couldn't escape. - Virgins music would follow you until you find out it's secret. - Be quiet. Be quiet. I just wonder... If I now it all... It is like love... But why it bothers me? Why it bothers me? If you want to go, just go. Be free to go. I don't want to. Take my carriage. I'm not joking, my knight, I'm serious. Bartholomew! Prepare carriage for our guest. - Is that a command? - Oh, no! How can I assure you? No. Than I won't go! I wanted to hear that from you. You can go, Bartholomew. Are those roosters? I can't hear them. All right. - It's time. - Time? - Do you still want to find out virgins secret? - Than it is the end. The end is beginning, and beginning is the end. - Are you afraid? - Of who? Of me. Come in. Come in. Look at them! They are mine. Mine! They were just like you. They kept their word. They didn't left me. They didn't. Look at this one. Come! That's him. My husband. He was the first and he will always be! Don't I look like a bird? And they... They loved me. Just like you. I know them by the sound. Everyone have his own sound that never changes. I would lie if I tell you that I loved only you. I loved them all. I still do. And you to. I love you. I love you! I love you! Look, look... I'll recognize your sound. I always will. Like your love. I am sad, Ivan. Only if you knew how sad I am. If it's hard for you to die, I swear you... I swear you... to kill me. I am waiting for that too long. Kill me. Kill! I love you. Kill me! Please! Forgive me... Forgive... Forgive... Forgive me.... Forgive me... Bartholomew! No!
