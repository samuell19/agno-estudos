You give us a list of the names of all the people, the places you've transacted with, and we're going to let you walk. Yeah, my lawyer should be here. Your lawyer? Your lawyer's the biggest charlatan. You know something? I think maybe your lawyer got himself lost on the way over here. Or maybe-- you know, maybe he's having himself lunch with some big old Hollywood producer? You're wasting your time. Yeah, well, you know, he's not your lawyer. He's there to protect Klein and Angel. Who I happen to know is living quite large out there, while you are in here. How do you know? How do I know? It's my job to know. And Angel-- Bobby, how am I going to-- how am I going to tell her? I don't believe you. Well, why don't you listen? Cause I'll just tell you. No, no, you know what? She's in denial right now. But let me tell you something, honey-- denial's not a river in Egypt, and you're in goddamn jail. You want to fucking tell me something new, go ahead. OK. OK.

Who's keeping you warm at night? The bottle. Not the blow? Who can afford it? So if you could afford it, you'd do it? Let's drop it, all right? So I had a little visit from the DA the other day. They're trying to build a case against you and Klein. What did you tell him? I told 'em to fuck off. But they said if I cooperate, they'll take some time off my sentence. What the fuck would you give them the time of day for, huh? That's stupid, man. That is fucking stupid. No, what is stupid is the fact that you fucked up. That's what's stupid. No, we told you a million and one times we'd get you out, haven't we? Look, baby, if Klein's going to help with more money, you don't need to hear this shit, OK? Yeah. Like the money that you were supposed to give my mother? What is this, a fucking prosecution, or what? Where is my money, Angel? I invested it, all right? Your mom would have drunk that money quicker than you can blink, and you know it. Come on, baby. Let's not argue, huh? You'd better get me out of here, or I-- Or what? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? Huh? You gonna bust out? If the cops don't get you, Klein will. Look, I'll go by and see your mom's, OK? OK?

Inmate Gidell Ryan escaped right here, through this gate, from Holmesburg Prison. She was missing from roll call at 3:00 PM, but it wasn't until 7:00 PM when the authorities pieced together her escape. We believe a correctional officer who was recently suspended assisted her in the escape.

Gidell Ryan was serving a six year sentence after being charged with money laundering and conspiracy. Also implicated were several prominent businessmen. God dammit. Among them was Victor Klein.
