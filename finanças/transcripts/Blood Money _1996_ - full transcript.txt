Let’s go Grisam Lester Grisam, your appeal is denied for the crime of murder. Grisam. Please. Grisam. I’m sorry. I did the best I could. You did just fine. How’d it go, Grisam? Just like I figured. We’re going to do it, huh Les? Yeah Dexie, we’re going to do it. Just like I planned. Don’t shoot. Go. Let’s go. Get his gun. What about me? Sorry. Didn’t see ya. Ah, come on. Come on. Honey you’re going to be late. It’s a quarter after. I can’t find my socks They’re in the box marked bureau But you’re not even dressed yet. I told you. My sister’s coming today, so I’m taking a sick day. Oh yeah? Uh huh. Well. Maybe I’ll take the day off too. Ooh. Why don’t you? Her flights not coming back for a couple of hours, maybe we can go back to bed? Hmm. I would love to. But today’s the day I hit Roberts up for that raise. Why don’t you wait until tomorrow when I can soften him up? No. Can’t have you fighting all my battles at work for me. Hey I just figured that since I work for him that maybe I can make him feel guilty. No. I’m going to fight this one on my own. And besides, I uh… I have this mortgage to pay off and everything. You mean we have this mortgage. Oh. Right. We. Well, since, uh, one of the two of us is going to be a slacker and hang out with her sister all day, someone’s got to pay the bills. Goodbye. Do you think we are going to turn into a bickering old couple like the people we bought the house from? You know what? I don’t mind as long as we turn into a bickering old couple together. Yeah. I guess. I mean, I wonder if we are going to be as happy as we are now. You know. When we’re older. Oh what, you mean like when we’re in our golden years? Yeah. Our golden years. So long as you’re by my side, I’ll be a happy old fart. You know you just say some of the most romantic things sometimes. So, is your sister excited about being your maid of honor? Yeah. I think she’s more nervous than I am. Oh. So now you’re nervous about marrying me? I’m nervous about the wedding. Not about marrying you. Aye, you just say the word and we’ll skip this old formal wedding thing. We could always to see a Justice of the Peace. Maybe fly to Vegas. No way, you’re not getting out of it that easy. Can’t blame a guy for trying. See ya later. Be home as soon as I can. Home. It really means something, doesn’t it? It certainly does. I love you. Christ’s sakes, they had a key. Where’d they get this? I want this whole building sealed. No one in. No one out. Pastorelli? Sir, over here. What a mess. What do we got? Uh, three escaped cons and a whole lot of dead corpses. Key and a handgun taped under the bench in the holding room. They just blasted their way out of here. Carjacked an old lady right in front of the courthouse. Yeah. You got a tail on ‘em? What? You’re kidding me. Took everyone by surprise. Just vanished into thin air. We have an all points out on the vehicle. Okay. Well give me all the files on these guys and check out the next of kin. Somebody may get a phone call. Done. Who are these bastards anyway? Sabbit, Sonny. Serving life and a twenty for murder and rape. Ah, Dexter, Clarence doing two lives for double homicide. And, Grisam... Lester Grisam? Yeah. Wrap sheet goes back since he was fifteen. You know him? Yeah. I put him away four years ago. Multiple homicide and armed robbery… That’s the guy. Oh yeah. That’s the guy. Les, what are we doing walking out here in the wide open? That car is hotter than a two-dollar pistol by now, stupid. Well then where the hell we going? Tell you when we get there. Dammit Les, I just don’t think this is a good idea. I’m doing the thinking here, okay? Anybody doesn’t like it, they can forfeit their share. Who are you laughing at? You. Fuck you. Hey, Hey. Hey. Hey. You want to play? You want to play? I want to play. I want to play. I want to play. Not too much further. Stupid shits. Stay away from me. I told him it was ridiculous, but he insisted on requesting an appeal. They all do, you know. So naturally it was denied. I said I did my best. That was the last I saw of him. So are you going to tell us you knew nothing about the gun and the key under the bench in the holding room? I’m a public defender. Why I would I want to help those schmucks? Did he ask you to deliver any messages, you know, to friends or relatives? No. I got the impression that he was in touch with his girlfriend, Wendy or Wanda, or somebody There must be records. Did he say anything like people he wanted to kill, people he hated? Do you want to teach your boy about attorney client privilege lieutenant? Look asshole I don’t give a shot about attorney client privileges And you’re not going to either as long as you’ve got my foot up your ass. Do you realize what you’re doing lieutenant? Oh yeah. Have you ever been deloused in the County lockup? Because I’m going to bust you as an accessory unless you tell me what the fuck I want to hear! I love it. Remember now, we just moved in. Oh. It’s great. It’s a mess. Needs so much work. Oh God, getting married, buying a house. Ooh, just like mom and dad. Please. It’s true. That’s a scary thought. So are you still seeing the surgeon? Adam? Uh, no. That was like three boyfriends ago. So, when do I get to meet the sucker? His name is Stuart. You’ll meet him soon enough. Can’t wait. Hello. Hey baby, your sister make it in alright? Yeah, we just got home. Great, I was thinking how about we all go out to Rinaldo’s for dinner tonight. How does Italian sound for dinner? Whatever. But I don’t eat meat. Since when? Sure, Rinaldo’s is fine. Listen, I have to go. Someone’s at the door. Okay, alright I’ll see you in a little bit. I love you. I love you too. Bye. Excuse me. My car broke down. May I use your telephone please? Kelly? Hey. Who do you… what’s going on here? Keep your trap shut little lady. What are you? And nobody gets hurt. Hey. We’re just going to make ourselves comfortable until your boyfriend gets home. Who are these guys? Oh, we’re just friends of ole Stuey boys. Or whatever he’s calling himself these days. What do you mean by that? When I knew him he called himself Hank. That son of a bitch set me up. Now sit down! Nice neighborhood. Dexter, see if they got some beer. And tequila. Ain’t nobody going to deny me a drink after all these years. So, when does lover boy come home? Soon. Good. Yoo-ee. Kitchen’s loaded. Fancy ass foreign beer and everything. Any booze? Only a Goddamn cabinet full. Don’t be going crazy on me Sabbit. I don’t need you sloppy. Ah. It’s been a long time since we’ve been around pretty ladies like you. I told you to take it easy on that shit. Don’t bust my nuts. You’re nice and soft here. Keep your hands off her. Hey. Hey. God damnit there’s time for that later. Right now we stick to the plan. Bobby bondo over hear I.D.d the photo, said they just walked out of here. They, uh, make any calls? Yeah one. Long Distance. The girlfriend. Probably. We’re checking on it. Well, let’s find her. Aren’t you going to tell me what we’re up against here? Well, you read the rap sheet. Yeah, but you busted the guy. Grisam’s the worst kind. No remorse. Ever. Just bad blood. Someone’s pulling into the driveway. Ah! Ah! Ugh. Kick him. Yeah. Yeah. Stop it. So Hank, or should I call you Stuart. Surprised to see me? No. No, no Grisam. What’s the matter boy? Cat got your tongue. What the fuck do you want? What I want is four years of payback. You’re doing nice. You’re doing real nice. Leave them out of it Lester. Your beef’s with me. We’ll see about that. All depends how you help me out with a little favor tomorrow. We found her. Wendy Munroe. She lives in Copperville. She was Grisam’s main squeeze up until his arrest. Okay. She was busted for possession of crack cocaine, served three months, other than that her record’s clean. Well have the Copperfield boys check out her residence. Let them know the three of them are armed and dangerous. Approach with caution. Done. Think she’d the one that planted the gun and the key? Well someone sure as hell did. If not her I got someone else I want to check out. We cut a deal with one of Grisam’s pals, got him to testify in exchange for immunity in the Witness Protection Program. What was his name? Simms. Hank Simms. It’s 942 Pine Street. I got it baby. You’re doing good sweetcakes. Can’t I come tonight? I miss you baby, I need you. I need you too darling, but we got to stick to the plan. But look, I just... Sit tight. We’ll be together soon enough. One more night’s not going to kill us. I don’t know if I can wait one more night. You listen to me, sweetcakes. You stay off the shit, you hear me? I’m off the shit. I’m clean. Make sure you stay that way. We don’t want to blow it now. Alright. I miss you. I miss you too baby. Tomorrow night. I told you to take it easy on that stuff. You and me, we are going to take a little trip in the morning. Where? Oh. Your office. What surprises me is why anyone would hire a felon like you. Oh but that’s right, you were never convicted. See your boy here made a deal. He sang state’s evidence against me for his freedom. And I was fool enough to think we were partners. No, no, no. We were never partners. You took the job, didn’t you? How the hell did you find me? You didn’t really think that the Witness Protection Program could keep you hidden from me, did you? Are you that stupid? Huh? Stewie. Stewie the stoolie. Are you that stupid? Huh? You see your boy here, he was quite a safe cracker in his day. Smart too. I bet you didn’t know that, did you? Is that true Stuart? Oh yeah. See I recruited your boy here for a little heist. See Nick Vento ran all the games in town. Gambling. Drugs. Prostitution. Grisam, I’ve got a funny feeling about this. What’s the matter? You don’t trust me? Alright Joey, you keep a lookout. Come on. Come on. Let’s go. Let’s go. Alright. Grisam, someone’s here. No problem. No, no no, hey. Burglary is one thing, no way am I going to be part of an armed robbery. It’s dirty money. Nobody is even going to report it missing. Forget it. Hey! You took the job. You’re not backing out now. Tell me no one’s going to get hurt. Scouts honor. No let’s go. He was as greedy as any thief I’ve ever worked with. No altar boy, oh no ma’am. Did you tell her about that big-titted Mexican cocktail waitress that you were banging back then? What was her name? Rowena. Does she know about her? Oh, there’s plenty you don’t know about Stewie the stoolie here. What’d he tell you, we went to college or something like that? Stuart? Oh yeah. See little lady, we ended going upstairs, and got down to business. What the hell are you doing? You don’t want him identifying any of us, do you? I’m getting out of here. No you’re not. Now you get to work or you’re next. Come on. Here it is. Come on. How long will this take? I told you, twenty minutes. Yeah, your boy here was real good at all that electronic bullshit, cracking codes and hacking. We’re going to utilize some of that talent come tomorrow morning. Forget it. You’re going to do what I tell you to, otherwise these girls are going to bleed all over these new hardwood floors. Now I’m getting a little hungry. What do you say we go into the kitchen and fix us up some grub? Huh? Yes, Agent Pierce. Pierce, Kincaid here. Lieutenant Kincaid, I didn’t think I’d ever hear from you again. Say do they still let you carry a badge? Well, somebody’s got to bust the bad guys. Why are you calling me for? Do you remember Lester Grisam? Oh yeah. I heard. Well I need to run a check on Hank Simms. I need to get his new I.D. remember him, State’s witness? You know once the witness enters the Protection Program we’re not allowed to disclose any information about his identity or his whereabouts. You should have known better than to even ask for that. Yeah, but we have reason to believe this guy may be in danger. Federal policy, I’d really like to help you, but... Can’t you at least check him out? We’re not supposed to even bother these people. Besides that, the chances of anyone discovering his whereabouts are very slim. Listen shit for brains you know Grisam. Simms may be a sitting duck or he may have had something to do with the escape. Yeah, yeah. I’ll check it out, okay? Uh, well, I’m sorry to bother you Pierce, but it is good to see all this cooperation between law enforcement agencies, huh? Got word from Copperville. Yeah? Girlfriend has cleared out of her apartment. No forwarding. And the neighbors say she’s been gone for a couple of days. Well figures. I want her found. Police. Freeze. On the ground. Alright scumbags, on the ground. Move it. Now. Hey sugar why don’t you come over here and give me some dessert? I’d rather die. Dead or alive makes no difference to me. Cindy. You… Hmm. Good. Grisam, you want my help Lester, you better keep your boys in line. Who are you calling boy? Put that down. I mean it Lester, anything happens to them… Don’t worry lover boy. They can be real fine gentlemen when they want to be. That’s right. I can be a real gentleman when I want to be. I’ll kill you Lester. I swear to God, anything happens to either one of them. Ou. We’re not here for your women, stoolie. After our little business tomorrow, we’re going to get all the snatch we can shake our sticks at, right boys? Woo-ee You got that right, Grisam. Who are you expecting? Nobody. Come on, let’s go. Come on. Who is it? Never seen him before. Don’t bullshit me. I swear, I have no idea. Get them out of here. Okay. Get rid of him. And be real cool about it. Mister Duncan? Stuart Duncan? Yes. Remember me? Special Agent Pierce, FBI. Listen, can I come in for a minute? No. Well, actually… Just a minute of your time. See, the thing is my fiancé is here and she doesn’t know about the…you know. Uh, no I understand but like I said I just need a minute of your time so maybe we can go someplace private. Yeah, she’s in the kitchen. What’s up? I don’t know if you’ve heard yet but, uh, Lester Grisam, he escaped from the county courthouse today. The authorities there requested me to come and check on you. I thought I was safe. No, no, you can relax. You’re safe. It’s just a precautionary formality, by the way you haven’t been to L.A. recently, have you? No. Why? I know you can verify that, right? You don’t think I have anything to do with this? Listen Mister Duncan it’s like I told you this is just a formality. I haven’t been in L.A. since the trial. Okay. So, uh, look. You know if you, uh, see anything, hear anything. Yeah, yeah. I’ll be sure to call. Okay. I appreciate it. And I’m sorry I had to bother you with all this. It’s okay. It’s just a precaution. I’m sure you’re safe. You understand? Yeah. Thanks. You did real good, lover boy. Couple of uniforms picked her up on a routine crack house raid. She used an alias, but when they ran her prints, bingo. Did you say anything yet? The boys saved her for you. You better get some coffee. Wendy? Wendy? I’m not deaf. I’m here to help you, if you let me. Right. Pig. Uhm, where is he Wendy? Where is who? Lester. How the hell should I know? You haven’t heard from him? Nope. I just thought maybe he missed you and…gave you a call. But then maybe I’m wrong, maybe he doesn’t give a shit about you. Look, I know what you’re trying to do, man. So just quit the shit, alright? You don’t know Lester. He loves me. Do you love him? Because if you do, you’ll tell me where he is. Before he gets hurt. Ain’t nobody can hurt my Lester. Yeah. Why don’t you try it yourself some time. Well Hank, you really turned yourself into a respectable upstanding citizen, didn’t you? Yeah. Why don’t you try it yourself some time. Oh, no worry about me. After tomorrow I’ll be plenty respectable. Yeah, how do you plan to do that? With your help. You see, I’ve been keeping tabs on you Wasn’t as hard as you might think, finding out where you are and what you’ve been up to. You must have had some help. Let’s just say I’ve got some friends. Then I guess I have some enemies. Nothing personal. Purely business. It’s just that you working at a big corporate bank and all made you a likely candidate. That’s all. I’m just a glorified clerk, Grisam. They don’t let me get near any cash. That’s not what I heard. My information tells me that you’re in charge of wire transaction security. Guess all that computer mumbo jumbo paid off, eh? Your information’s wrong, Grisam. Well it better not be, for your lady’s sake. See I figure we waltz into those fancy-ass offices of yours and play a little tune on that computer keyboard, something to the melody of ten million dollars. You’re nuts. Nuts to not have thought of it before, yeah. Then again I never had a friend in banking security. With the help of your security codes I figure we just wire some money to an offshore account. It will never work. It takes weeks to open an offshore account. Oh, don’t worry about that. It’s all taken care of. Sounds like you put a lot of planning into this. Let’s just say I’ve had a lot of spare time to think about it thanks to you. Alright let me get this straight. I pull off this little wire job for you, and you leave us be. Nobody gets hurt. Scouts honor. Fill it in. Grisam. What’s up Joey? Joey? Joey come in Come on. Grisam you son of a bitch you’re a dead man. Nothing personal Nick. Purely business. Fuck you Grisam. I got you. Alright. Alright take the money and get the fuck out of here. You are in no position to tell me what to do. Now get on your knees. Ah, cut the bullshit. I said get on your knees. Grisam, please. No, no, no come on Grisam. Should have stayed home tonight, Nicky boy. Listen to me, let’s get out of here. What are you doing? Dexie What? Huh? Change places with Sabbit. Get some sleep. You better get some rest, too. We’re going to need you bright-eyed and bushy-tailed come morning. It just doesn’t figure. Alibi is airtight. I checked him and the alibi personally, not a thing is out of place. Well just give me the guy’s new address, let me put a man out there. No can do. Regulations. Always by the book, huh Pierce? What do you want me to do? It’s called upholding the law, you should try it sometime. Any luck? I’ll take it under consideration. Any luck? No. She’s no Goddamn help. But I know she knows something. What are we going to do with her? We’re going to let her go. What? You heard me. We’re going to set her free, and let her lead us straight to Grisam. Alright. I’ll get Phillips and Shebrowski on it. No no no no. I want you. I don’t want any screw ups. Please just don’t do anything foolish. I’d never to anything to put you in danger. Kelly I’m so sorry about all this. I’m so sorry that I lied to you. I just never expected my past would come back to haunt me. Yeah well I feel like I don’t know you anymore. No, you know me. I’m still the same person. I still love you. Let’s go Romeo. It’s showtime. You know no matter how much cologne you put on it still won’t get rid of your stink. Now we can do this the easy way, or we can do this the hard way. You know she’s right, Grisam. You’ll never be anything but a stupid two-bit thief. Hurry it up. Yoo-ee Damn Grisam. You’re looking good. Get used to it boys, after today I’m going to have a whole closet full of these, let’s go Stewie we’re going to be late to work. Tell your boys. They know the score. No, just tell them. I want you boys to be on your best behavior in front of the ladies. Got it? Look Grisam I ain’t had to tail in eleven years. I gave this man my word, now you don’t want to make a liar out of me no do ya? Wouldn’t dream of it. Sabbit? Whatever you say, Les. Stuart, be careful. I’ll see you in a little while. Don’t worry, I won’t let anything happen to your little boy. She’s been in her room all morning. I told the manager to alert me of any calls, in or out. Call me if she makes a move. Will do. So where have you been? I was expecting you last week. Oh, you know. I’ve been busy, busting punks. Good month, huh? Not bad. You still on for that fishing trip next weekend, right? You bet.

What’s not polite? Well isn’t it obvious? What? Dexter…he’s obviously, you know… Oh. Yeah. I’m sorry. What do you mean? It’s nothing to be ashamed of. Calling me a sissy? Is that what you mean?

I figure I’d use yours this time. Setting me up. That’s your plan? It will buy us the time we need. Besides, you don’t have to worry about that. Look, it ain’t part of the plan. We have to stick to the plan. Do you really think Grisam’s going to share his money with you just for keeping watch on us? I trust him. I wouldn’t if I were you. What would you know? We did time together. We were like brothers. Dexter I have to go the bathroom. Well you can forget about it. Come on. I really have to go. Okay you two go together. That way I can keep an eye on you.

This place is giving me the creeps. In time. All in due time. What do you want Kincaid? Let him go. He’s a cop. It’s alright, I can handle him. I just lost my partner because of you. He was tracking Grisam’s girlfriend. What are you talking about? What am I talking about? I’m talking about Hank Simms. Does he happen to live in Mayfield? Goddamn you Pierce, that’s where my partner was killed. I told you, I already checked Simms out. I want his new I.D. now. Or do I have to slap you again?

I still owe Stewie four years of payback. Don’t be stupid, Grisam. You got your money. You got what you want why don’t you get the hell out of here why you still can. If I wanted your advice smart-ass, I would have asked for it. Come on Les, baby. I mean, maybe he’s right. Come on let’s just beat it. I’ve been waiting four years for this. It’s time for a little fun. Get away from me. Yeah. Let’s have some fun. You gave me your word. Yeah, that’s right. Scouts honor. Trouble is, I never was a scout.

Aren’t you going to tell them about the Cayman Islands account? Caveman Islands? The boy’s delirious. Dexter, he’s got millions stashed away in an account. Ooh. Hey, you take it easy buddy, huh? You too Les. Let’s go Sabbit. I’ll be right there I’m stocking up. Somebody’s coming out. You recognize him? No. Let’s go Sabbit. Hey Les! What the hell was that? What the fuck! Get down. He’s still got hostages inside. You think I don’t know that, huh? You think I don’t know that. Get the tear gas. No, not yet. We’re going to try to make contact first. Oh yeah, yeah, everything by the book, huh Pierce? You got a problem with that? Get me a phone. What? Grisam, is that you buddy? Well if it ain’t my old friend Jack Kincaid. Long time Lester. Four years. You still extorting money from two-bit bookies? Oh, what’s that supposed to mean? I mean are you still mad at me for killing your friend Nick Vento? You two had quite an arrangement. Okay let’s cut the crap, Grisam. Are you ready to give yourself up or should we do it the hard way again, huh? Not while I’ve got three innocent hostages in here. Oh yeah, and how do we know that? You don’t. Care to call my bluff? Ah, I just want to see em. You’ll see em when I see a armored car out front that’s going to take me to a Lear jet that you’re going to arrange for me. Look I’m not cutting any deals until I see those hostages. Have it your way. Grisam. Grisam. Shit. Think he’s bluffing? Well knowing Grisam, if there are any hostages in there they’re dead my now. They killed Dexter. Basement. Storm door. Shit. It’s locked from the outside. They’re gone! Go find them. Shit! Hold your fire. Hold your fire. They stopped shooting. Kelly. I want you to know I never meant to put you in any danger. Stuart, please. Listen. I know I have made some mistakes in the past, I thought that was all behind me. I am not like that anymore. Please, forgive me. I do love you. I love you too, Stuart. No more secrets. I swear. Hey. I’ve got a little secret of my own. Look out. Upstairs, now! Hold on Wendy. It’s over. I said upstairs. Do it! Wendy. Calm Down. Everything is going to be alright. Wendy! Wendy! Do it! Wendy. It’s not worth it. Wendy, where are you? Now. Give me the gun. Give me the gun. Wendy! Are you okay? Sorry. Just wait here. What the hell was that? Kiss your ass goodbye, Stoolie. He's got a gun. Stuart. So. Still want to marry me? Now more than ever. Can you hear me? Yeah. Where’s Kelly? Well we were hoping that you might tell us that. What do you mean? Well she and her sister haven’t been seen since the night of the shooting. Is she alright? Do you have any knowledge about the missing eleven million dollars from several accounts at your bank? Yeah. Grisam. He made me wire it into am offshore bank. We know that. But that particular account has since been closed out. So. What that got to do with me? So tell us where Gina is. Who’s Gina? Gina Zimmerman. Also known as Sally Walters. Also known as Miss Ryan. Your darling fiancé. Don’t play dumb. Hey. Wait. I don’t know what the hell you’re talking about. She’s been on our most wanted list for almost six years now. Fraud. Confidence games, mostly. Her and her sister have an outstanding warrants list a mile long and we know that she masterminded this whole charade. Took her own sweet time about it too. Worked for two years at the bank so she could know the exact right account to hit. And she recruited Grisam while he was still in the penitentiary. Somehow got that information to him and still kept her identity a secret. Played him like a puppet. She managed not to reveal her identity to him. I guess somebody had to take the fall. She disguised herself as the cleaning lady at the courthouse, planted the gun and the key to the handcuffs so he can make his escape. No. it’s not possible. If what you say is true then she must have known all about me, and…Stuart Dunkin, you have the right to remain silent. What are you talking about? I never told anyone. Come clean, Mister Duncan. You had ties to both Grisam and Kelly. Nobody’s that stupid we know you were in it from the beginning. You’re kidding, right? Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to an attorney during questioning. If you cannot afford one, one will be provided for you free... of charge.
