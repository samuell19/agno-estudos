What will you do? I'll be out in the street. -That bad? I won't have it I'll think of something -No way The same old story:. A desperate young girl with nowhere to go, - street lamps swaying in the night, the pier, the dark inviting water We must think of something else. You know the address You're sweet. -No, I'm an evil pig Never trust people. Don't answer the phone If you go out, leave the door open. -How will you get in? I'm away for the weekend. Let's see if I come back It is weekend, isn't it? -Do I have to clean up? No, don't touch anything. You can wash the dishes How can I repay you? Let's think about that later. -So you've become selfish too? Can't afford not to be If you get cold, close the window. Got it? Out you go, nice and easy Hi, Manne. -Shut it Nice to see you again You think so? Sorry, no bananas today Wait in the car Nice company you keep, Mitya. Is he your TV-club leader?

You knew the rules I meant money. Twenty grand Right, Mitya? I wasn't hired as a bookkeeper We'll settle that later Looks like you don't know which side you're on Manne's a special case You should get paid extra for ratting on a friend When will you bring my money? -Whose money? Send the Law Smartass. Do you have the money? -Of course not Then you've got a week to find either of these The painting's more important She'll come back anyway What am l? An art dealer? That's your problem. You know a lot of people And if I find it for you? -We'll forget the whole incident And that ape will serve tea and biscuits? You've got one week, smartass We won't be so friendly next time Something's wrong with your head. -Whose isn't? I'll put a bandage on it Guess you don't want to tell how you got it. -No, I don't Some old lady clobbered you It's not bad. It'll heal in a week Well... -Well what? Where's the painting? -What painting? The one you talked about. -Oh, that painting What else? You asked me to come and see it Yes I did, in the morning It was a long time ago. It's in the office I knew it. -ls it a fake? No. How did you get this? From a hysterical woman - who needed a ticket far away I gave her all I had, over 2 000 marks She'd got it from her mother. That's what they always say This woman? -That's her, but the photo is old Forget the whole thing. I must go Is it valuable? Yes, don't show it around for a while I have to sort things out Have you seen Veera? -Veera? Why? I saw her this morning. -I don't want to know She was as beautiful as a freeway at night And just as fast Who do you think you are? -What do you mean? All you have to do is open the door - and I'll jump in, right? That's what you did. -So what? You're still wrong Well you can't come straight through the door, or can you You wouldn't be surprised if I did. I've got my reasons And I know how to get a lift That I remember. -No use pretending anything Alright Would you kindly get in? The car's electrics are gone and your eyes would be a joy I plan to navigate by the stars. -Alright Perhaps we'll meet again. -Perhaps we can't avoid it Are you planning to try? -I'll do my best. And you? Likewise Don't look back Is this a dream or wine talking. I'm sitting here alone, - remembering the times when we were so little, - that we sat on the edge of the carpet and sway our feet About the size of a horses head? -That's right Take a sip My God, the bottle is empty Who drank that? Go inside. It's cold and you'll freeze Manne, take care of her little hands Is she new here? -Brand new Gives faith in the future of the countryside. Interested? Always. In everything that moves I have to get away from here soon or it'll be too late Shall I leave or not? I'll give myself five minutes to make my mind up Time flies like an elk.

Shall we marry? How many acres you got? -What? No way otherwise with that face One has to think of one's future Will you really watch wieners boil the rest of your life? -I guess not Let's dance then, I'd like to hold you in my arms Was it a good party? My little wife Anna-Kaarina Her tiny little hands Where's the car? I'll drive If you fail to return in May, I'll burn the whole village away... Leaving is the most important thing. -Why don't you go then? Do you want me to, woman? -I guess not You don't sound too convinced I'll drive! What about the truck? -Keep it You'll get it back when you return. -I'm not coming back Sure you are. I'll have coffee ready Put some oil in. -What? In the truck. -Right Bye, Harri. Send us a postcard Don't do that! My shoulder will fall off Something's wrong with your head Unnecessary violence. Terrible! Just when I'd cleaned the place up Why didn't you fight back? -I tried but there were three of them I could've managed two. I hit one of them Drink that. -Thanks How did they find you? Who cares? The press poisons the minds of our children You don't have any. -Who knows? So the painting's gone? -Yes We'll have to think a bit. -You think. I've had it I need a change of scenery, if you get my meaning All my plans keep getting fucked up. -Where're you going? Paris, Rome, Rio. The possibilities are endless Your passport? In the fridge That's all there is. I'm dieting Ville Alfa, yes V for Verner, A for Athos. Thanks The plane for Paris leaves in an hour. Ready? Yes Nowadays one must travel light Shame to leave a good business It's impossible to be in peace here If you try to sleep somebody peers from under the bed - making sure you're alright. You can't even die in peace here! That's true Good day. -Good day They wouldn't take this as an toothbrush I got it from a Japanese princess You've never been in Japan. -I never said I was Call me when you've pulled off the Revolution You'll need a Minister of Finance Crazy bastard.

In the kitchen Manne, I must go now So the pocket calculator's taking you back then? Lots of luck, you'll need it Do you have to take it like that? I don't take anything in any way.

There are no exceptions It's not that simple I've had some problems lately That's why they want to take a look at your accounts I'm not going to allow it. -Think again What have they done to earn their money? They just sit behind their desks They don't have to get up. They've lawyers for that You know it just as well as l Yes I know, unfortunately. What can I do? Nothing. -You wouldn't have spoken to me like that ten years ago Ten years, it's a lifetime. -Are you scared? No, just tired They asked me to warn you. Now I've done it That's all A beautiful painting. But like I said on the phone, - I'm not interested And I've heard there's been a slight dispute over this one. -Perhaps Thing's would've been different a few years ago Perhaps I'm getting old The years roll by, like it or not. What do you plan to do with it? Who'd be interested in the painting - but not where it's coming from That's in Tampere He'll take it without questions I don't want to hear any more of it Do you know who you're messing with? -Yes Better use the back door Manne. -Mitya!

What'll it be? Rye whisky. -You talked me into it Where's the Snake Woman? -She's gone Where? We've got a show tonight How should I know? To the mountains, I guess Ask Carlos, they had a terrible fight He never gives a straight answer Did she take the snakes with her? Yes... I guess Good, I hated them Want to play the roulette? I heard you've got money. -Why not Gambling is illegal but luckily the flesh is weak And I'm sick of arguing over coffee packets - with old country hens Too bad. Another try? This is just the beginning. One of us will end up a rich man You can't win. I cheat That's a very bad habit Does this place pay? Yes, I can tell you that - but don't tell the taxman I've never been called a loudmouth You want a job? We've got openings I must see the world a bit. I've been sitting still for 23 years I've been on the road since I was one. In fact longer, - I was born on the Orient Express between Bombay and Delhi But you get tired of it, of everything True, it's strange My wife got tired of me two years ago No wonder, really Ladies and Gentleman, welcome to Eldorado!

That's Manne's I know. What about you? What about me? Nothing much. What're you talking about? We're old friends Met in lceland a year ago Are we going to stay here? No, we're already on our way What is there between you two? Only love Nothing serious then Why aren't you together then? We don't fit together, we argue terribly I don't quarrel. But I do A Scotsman says to his friend: Are you the one that pulled my son out of the water yesterday? You're supposed to say: Yeah Yeah. Where's his cap, then? Put that on. Haven't got a cassette deck What? No deck? Nope There must be a radio shop somewhere. Guess so Well, then... Will my wings carry the load of my sorrow I couldn't stay with you for long I think of you but I don't know I wasn't ready for your leaving Looking out I see your eyes there... Bad hangover? Remember me? I'm trying to. Thanks for the blanket The night was cold and you just wouldn't wake up I guess I was having a nice dream Where do you know Manne? From school, and you? Sunday school Is Veera your real name? Why? Not a sensible question, I guess I don't like sensible people Should I mind my own business? Think you could try? If I was ten years younger, I'd go swimming Then you'd be three That was nice. Too bad it isn't true We must not see reality as it is - but as it lives in our dreams Shall we wake Manne up and make some coffee? A beautiful morning. Good morning. A cigarette, young man! Great car. A car's a car License and registration The photo's old. lt was taken in confirmation class Get out of the car Where are your papers? Don't have them with me Let go! Let the girl go! She's wanted! What do you know about it? You should stay at home Another round Why are they looking for you? You wouldn't like the answer They've been after you as long as I can remember That's different. Why's that? I'm me. Who am I then? Wish I knew. Not me, anyway. Thank God for that I want to know why they are after you. -I stuck up a drug store Is that true? It's a long story A guy tried to buy me with trinkets - and when it didn't work he claimed I'd stolen them. Ok? Say the word and the bastard dies What good would that do? The world is full of bastards Is that the only reason? No. I've been stealing too To get something to eat? Just for fun Not enough, since you got caught Will you go to Afghanistan with me? What would I do there? I'm entering a convent tomorrow Think of what you're saying You should act and not just think Veera's gone. I know, I talked to her Why didn't you wake me up? She told me not to You call that a reason? What am l, a family advisor? I'd drag her to the altar if I was you Did she explain anything? Only that if you cared for her, - you'd take care of her. She's right That's what you think How can you care for somebody who can't stay still a moment? I just told you that... I don't want to hear! Mind your own business. Don't complain then I'm not complaining. You don't understand anything about these things Fuck off, will you. Understood Don't make noise! Let's go. I want to finish the game How long are you going to play? Until they close the joint I'm going. Suit yourself With the dawn, the sky turns red I cast away the cape of pain Sun and moon they change places And the night again sinks its teeth into my neck I follow the bright star Wheels are turning days roll by No matter why I'm leaving All that counts is I can't stay I can't stay I am a flower savaged by the cold rain All my hopes run into sand The rain throws me to the ground Although I don't live by the sword I die by it I die by it Guess I missed you I'm not sorry, but my car is We all make mistakes How could I've known that you were the wrong man? I'm not Do you often shoot at passers-by? If they come too near. This is my land - and I've got a right to defend it Do you want coffee? Looks like you need it I've heard about you. How come? We listen to the police radio More to listen to there than on the networks Did you know that you're wanted? I thought it likely Where are the others and what are your plans? Don't ask so much What was that shooting about? We own this land and they're trying to evict us Who are they? By what right? That's a complicated story They've got some sort of expropriation order - but I have to sign it first I see. That's why I let nobody near The postman didn't call twice Now they've decided to use force And you? We stay here Stop shooting your mouth I want to listen to some music He must know all the facts - to form his opinion. Music What kind of music do you like? Anything goes. You got anything to drink? Wake up, you must go What? Don't ask questions, come down Gotcha! But now they mean business Go now, we'll cover you. I could help No, you got your own problems Go now, Manne Hurry up! Goodbye and good luck. Good bye Good day. Good day I need a room. Sign here Room 14, turn left at the end of the corridor I'm not taking any calls. I want to sleep Wake me up at 8.30 Good evening, it's 8.30. Thanks Vodka and mineral water Two calvados May I sit down? Looking that sad, you'd better What's a nice girl like you doing in a place like this? Cleaning and making beds. Then I have to listen - to guests like you trying to pick me up I can't afford to fail any more. Nobody can Who jumps in first? Neither We both know that The future's bright Really? Where? I've got a plane ticket to Paris. Will you come with me? We'll see. I must think about it It's getting cold May I see you safely to your room? Don't wake me in the morning I'm not going to wake up myself What's up, Harri? Nothing much. You? Nothing special. I found Veera Isn't that something. How about a game? If you want to lose. I won't lose, you will That's what you think Little boys shouldn't trust women They only bring you sorrow But even a little boy in the evening can stare through the window At the princess of his dreams In the window, in the window in the window I found my girl She's the prettiest woman I know Got no chest but I don't mind Her hat is fine, body divine In the window I found my girl Oh! Glendora, Oh! Glendora Oh! Glendora how I adore you Place your bets No more bets Red, sixteen Place your bets No more bets Red, sixteen. Not bad. May I have this dance? We met on a wonderful evening The moon shone birds were singing You took me to your summer place And I knew how it would end When we got there I could smell the flowers... Can I help you? You can't Get dressed It was a mistake to try to fool me I know you've sold the picture. I want the money! Go fuck yourself! Hagstrom! Keep out of this Do you think you can treat me like a fool? I could've forgiven everything else You've got five minutes to produce the money And you've got five seconds to go to hell You know that I can make you talk How much do you care about her? Get the hell out of here. Hey, what's this? I'll take care of him I've had enough. I quit. Now get the fuck out of here! You have a patient there called Harri Salminen I'd like to know how he is How's Harri? Harri who? He's dead Roadblock. Where? Straight ahead Should we stop? I guess so Remember the day we met? What about it? Nothing much. The clouds looked the same You've got a good memory You used to smile back at me then What the hell is all this? Don't worry about it. Business as usual The opposition gets gunned down or their milk gets spoiled at night I can't take any more hassles. What can we do? First we have to rest. Then we'll have to split for a while I'm going to see Hagstrom I'd like to make a call to Paris I don't know the number here, I'm in a phone booth You can call directly? The wonders of technology. Shoot 9-9-0-3-3-1 And yourself? Minor problems Where are you? Need help? I'll take the first available taxi Absolutely not. Stay there Do you know how ugly Paris really is in the spring I don't want to hear. You're escaping from reality No, reality's escaping from me Perhaps it's not worth catching That' s not good enough reason for existence You must learn to be humble You need to learn that? More than anything else Arrogance comes naturally Pessimistic theory. Whose money are you living on? Until I finish my great historical novel - the fire in a girl's eyes keeps me warm Her name is Zelda I just wanted to tell you - that I've sent you a pile of money to the Poste Restante That was nice. Life is very expensive here Downhill all the way since the Revolution The Moulin Rouge is like McDonalds Got to hang up. See you soon The train will be here soon. Have you got money? Enough Why won't you take me along? I have to do it alone But I'll be waiting for you in Paris, at the Gare du Nord - on June 30, 6 p.m. Will you be there? I'll try Mitya... Manne here I know You must help me I want to find Hagstrom You didn't quit then. Where is he? What room? Room 209. Thanks, Mitya I'm a sick man, an evil man Repulsive being. And I think I've got liver trouble Will you take me to the airport? This is Veera Hello, Veera
