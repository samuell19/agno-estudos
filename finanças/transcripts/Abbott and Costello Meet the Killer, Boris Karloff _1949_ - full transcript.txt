You didn't dot the I. Whew. Hey Joe, who's this guy Strickland? All you news hawks hanging around here, half the guests are inquiring about him. A fine hotel dick. Don't you ever read anything outside The Racing Form? Amos Strickland is the number-one criminal lawyer in the country. Why all the excitement? Lawyers have visited the Lost Caverns before. Sure, but when the lawyer's Amos Strickland and he postpones an important case to come up here, something's cookin'. Hold it, no pictures, boys. How about a statement for Herald? No statement, and I said no pictures. Mr. Strickland, how long are you gonna be here? Come on, boys, break it up, you heard the man. Beat it, go ahead. Who is he? You must be Mr. Strickland. Brilliant, you must be the hotel detective. Jeff, Mr. Strickland. Good evening, Mr. Strickland. I'm sorry you were annoyed, but you know how newsmen are. Unfortunately, yes. Tell Mr. Crandall I'm here. I'm sorry, sir, Mr. Crandall's not in, but I'll tell his niece you're here. She's very anxious to speak with you. Young man, if I wanted to speak to his niece, I'd ask for her. The moment Mr. Crandall comes in, tell him I want to see him. Yes, sir. Freddie, will you show Mr. Strickland to room 125? Yes, sir. Oh, my leg. Be more careful, my good man. I'm sorry. - My umbrella. - Yes, sir. Oh, pick up my bag. Look, look. Look at my glasses. They're broken. I'll have your job for this. Aren't you too old for this type of work? I'll have you discharged, fired! Pick up my bag. Get out, you, you, you careless idiot. Get out of here, get out. What seems to be the trouble? Who are you? I'm Mr. Melton, the hotel manager. Oh, you are, are you? Well, look at my glasses. Who's responsible for this? - He is. - What! Well, it's your fault. If you hadn't come here, you'd never have broke 'em. I insist that you discharge this moron immediately. Take off that uniform and get out, you're fired. Fired? Okay, I'll go. I wanna tell you something, Mr. Strickland, I'll get even with you for this. Every dog has his day, and I'll have mine. I'm gonna make you pay for this. Are you threatening me? In words of one syllable, yes. Pah, pah. So you got fired, eh? Yes, I did, and I'm gonna tell you the same thing that I told him: Every dog has his day. I'll show you to your room, Mr. Strickland. Casey, bring the bags up. - Who, me? - You. The key please, Jeff. This way. Jeff, give me a hand, will ya? Jeff, have you been demoted to bellboy? No, just helping Casey. They belong to the great Mr. Strickland. Jeff, I told you to notify me the instant he got here. He said he didn't want to speak to you, just your uncle. Mr. Strickland's a man you don't argue with, he just got Freddie fired. Betty, I said Freddie's been fired again. What? Oh, Freddie. I'll speak to my uncle. Is there anything wrong? Not a thing. - My key, please. - Yes, Mrs. Grimsby. Thank you. Mr. Strickland, I'm sorry I barged in like this, but I really came in to apologize to you. I'm sorry for the way I talked to you. Really I am, Mr. Strickland. And I'm also sorry, Mr. Strickland, that I dropped the golf bag on your toes. It musta hurt. Mr. Strickland, there's somethin' else I wanna say. I'm sorry I broke your eyeglasses. Thanks a lot for allowing me to apologize to ya. Mr. Strickland, now that I apologized, would you mind tellin' Mr. Melton? Mr. Strickland, don't you think it's better if you go inside the next room? There's a bed in there to lay down. Hmm, it's a short walk. Mr. Strickland. Don't you feel well? Uh-oh, this guy's plenty sick. Oh. Whew. He made it. Oh. What you need is air and plenty of it, and I ain't gonna give it to ya with a little handkerchief. I gotta give you plenty of air. Mr. Strickland, come on, will ya. I gotta do somethin' to help you. Come on, I, I want. Blood. Blood. He's dead. Who did it, Mr. Strickland? Gee, that's funny. I always thought that if I was in a room alone with a dead person, I'd be scared. Ha, ha. But, Casey! - Hey, Mr. Melton, come on. - Where? - How you feelin'? - Casey! What's going on over here? What's the matter, Mr. Melton? This idiot just attacked me. Take him out of here before he kills somebody. Oh me, I didn't do it, I never killed anybody. I just happened to find the body, he was dead before I even got there. - What body? - Who's dead? What are you talking about? Mr. Strickland, he's been murdered. Murdered? Yeah. Impossible, we don't permit murders in this hotel. - Ah, Mr. Smelton. - Melton! The poor man, he's dead, dead, dead. I walk in, tip my hat,. Come here. Excuse me. Th-Th-Th-there he is. - He is dead. - Sure, he's dead. I been tryin' to figure how to say that he's dead. - I'll see ya later. - Wait a minute. Walk away, and nobody touch that body. Touch it, I don't even wanna look at it. Not a word of this to the guests, we must keep it quiet. Maid, you'd better leave an extra sheet for Casey to cover up the dead body. Dead body? Oh! That's enough, that's enough. Get her quiet, and don't touch a thing. I'm gonna call the police. Hello? What's the matter, what happened? - There's been an accident. - Is it serious? - Murder. - Murder! Hello, Operator. Get me Inspector Wellman. Why, it's Mr. Strickland. Jeff, take Betty to her room. No, I don't wanna speak to the sergeant, I wanna speak to Wellman. That's awful. He was such a nice man. Do you have a handkerchief? Yeah. Uh-uh. What happened? Strickland was murdered. He's dead. No, no, I don't wanna speak to the sergeant, I wanna speak to Inspector Wellman and hurry it up. What's going on here? Hey. I caught this man trying to make off with that briefcase. I thought it might contain important evidence. You caught me trying to get away with this briefcase? It was him, you fibber. How dare you call Mr. Brooks a thief? Apologize at once, tell him you're sorry. Apologize? Mr. Brooks, I'm sorry you're a crook. - Pig head. - Ping. Freddie. Mr. Melton. Keep this as quiet as possible. I'll put this in the safe. Hello. Hello, Inspector Wellman? This is Casey, Casey of the Lost Caverns Hotel. You'd better hop right over here, looks like we've got a murder on our hands. Okay. - Oh, Mr. Casey. - Yeah? My name's Relia, I checked in this morning. What can I do for you, Mr. Relia? I heard about the murder. My gun disappeared from my room a couple hours ago. It's registered in my name. And if it turns out to be the murder weapon, well, I just want the police to know. Have you any idea who took it? Well, it could've been a maid, a waiter or a bellboy. Bellboy, that makes sense. Bellboys carry pass keys. Right. Could be a bellboy, because I was a bellboy myself and I know. I had a passkey, I could get into every room in the place. What am I sayin'? Casey, search him, he may have Relia's gun on him. - Now, listen, I mean... - Quiet, quiet, quiet. I don't know how I get in the middle of all these things. "Casey, search him," hmph. That's mine. Nothing on him. Mr. Smelton, or Melton, you're not gonna implicate me unless you get away with it. Casey, I heard him threaten Mr. Strickland. Don't let him out of your sight until the police come. Troublemaker. - Casey, I'm worried. - I know. You don't think I had anything to do with it, do ya? No, no, but it looks bad, Freddie, it looks bad. I know. Course, you have two things in your favor. Number one, they found no bloodstains on ya. Number two, the gun that killed Strickland is still missing. That I'm very happy for. Yeah, but on the other side of the ledger, all the evidence points to you. You were seen fighting with him, - then you lost your job. - Yeah. Course, that supplies the motive. Sure. Then you were heard threatening him, and you were seen coming out of his room. What are you doing? Gotta take to laundry. Laundry, to the laundry? Yeah. Wait a minute, come here, just a minute. Hey, where'd you get that gun? I don't know. Freddie, for the last time, I'm going to ask you where'd you get that gun? I don't know. Where'd you get that gun? That's not fair, you said for the last time, - I answered it. - Now, look Freddie... You're using unfair tactics. I'm trying to help you out. There's no doubt this what this is Relia's gun and there's now doubt what they planted it in here. We've gotta get it back to his room before the police come, otherwise, you're a dead duck. Now, why would anybody want to put a thing like that in here for? When we find that out, we'll find the culprit. Who's the culprit? The culprit and the murderer are the same. Oh, they are? Come on, come on, shake a leg. Duck, duck. Something sneaky about that dame. I think you're right, I'm gonna question her. She went that way, over the other way. Now, don't forget, if he's in here, just pretend we've made a mistake, shh. Just stop. - Ah, the wrong key. - Try this one. What? Where'd you get that? - Red. - Red who? Red Skelton, it's a Skelton key. - Skelton. - Opens up any door. Come on. Hey. This guy is certainly a messy housekeeper. This place has been searched. I wonder if it coulda been that dame we saw down the hall. Whoever it was did a thorough job. I'll say they did. Look, let's plant the gun here and get out. Hey, wait a minute. This is a telegram to Michael Relia. Get a load of this: "I'm including your case in my memoirs." "Imperative you be at the Lost Caverns Hotel this weekend." "Signed, Amos Strickland." You know, this could tie in with the murder. I'm gonna check on this Relia. You go see if the coast is clear, I'll plant this gun in one of his suits in the closet. Oh. You didn't see me. You didn't see me. You didn't see me. I wasn't here. Okay, I planted the gun. Come on, let's go. Come, what's the matter with you? - I didn't see him. - You didn't see who? - The man who wasn't here. - What man? All I did was open up the door, see if the coast was clear. My mind went blank. Your mind's been blank all your life. Come on, close the door. I said come, come on. I didn't see him. I'll have a coroner's report on Strickland the first thing in the morning for you, Inspector. That'll be fine, Doc. Now, let's see, where were we, Milford? You said you've been Strickland's secretary for nearly 20 years. Over 20 years. Know any enemies he had? Oh naturally, Inspector Wellman, a big criminal lawyer is bound to make some enemies. But I don't know of anyone who would've resorted to murder. You're wasting your time, Inspector, you've got the murderer, Phillips, the bellboy. Mr. Melton, if you don't mind, I'll handle this case in my own way. Sergeant, bring that bellboy in. Okay, Phillips, the Inspector wants you. Now, be firm. You just leave 'em to me, I can handle this two guys. Atta boy. You can go, Melton. Okay, Phillips. I didn't do it, I tell ya. Inspector, I didn't do it. Please, please, Inspector, I didn't do it, don't hit me. Don't hit me, don't twist my arm, don't twist my arm. I'm innocent, I tell ya, I'm innocent. Don't hit me on the head with a rubber hose. Please don't, what, don't hit me on the head with a rubber hose. Wait a minute, shut up. What? The man didn't touch you with his little finger. What kind of third degree is this? I don't give third degrees. - Stingy. - All right. What's the matter with that guy, Casey? Oh, Inspector, he's been that way all his life. He's too dumb to commit a murder. But I don't understand, why is he always hollerin' about rubber hoses? Casey, show him the telegram. What telegram, are you withholding evidence? Oh no, no, no, Inspector. I was going to give you this. We found this in Relia's room. I'll look this over later. In the meantime, I'm releasing this bellhop in your custody. He's not to leave this hotel. - Oh, but I got to, Mr. - Melton said I have to get out. You'll remain as a guest of the state. - A guest? - That's right. They pay for everything? Inspector, if you get a chance, come up and see me sometime. Thank you, goodbye. Oh, excuse me. Oh, oh, just a moment, dear, it's all right. Will you bring the phone over here, please? Hello. Yes. Of course. I'd be delighted. Thank you. We're gonna have a guest. Casey, I want you to order me pheasant on the half shell. Also order me crepes tied around Suzette, and my special order of caviar with bologna on the side. Now look, Freddie, I know you're a guest of the state, but don't you think you're carrying this thing too far? After all, California's a big state. If it was Rhode Island, it'd be different. - $8.55, Mr. Phillips. - Can you spell California? - Certainly. - Sign the check, please. If you please. And put a big tip on for everybody. Oh, thank you very much. You're welcome, you're welcome, you're welcome, you're welcome. Goodbye now, see you tomorrow. You won't be here tomorrow. Yes, I will. Wait'll Inspector Wellman sees the report I have on Michael Relia. You will be just an ordinary little bellhop again. I don't intend to be a bellhop anymore. Mm-hmm. Furthermore, I have a date with Angela Gordon. - I... - Ha, ha. You mean to tell me that good-lookin' dame made a date with you? - Yes. - I don't believe it. Angela, my Angela. Please. Ah, come in, darling. Darling? Here's your suit. Angela, huh? Angela. Oh, am I intruding? No, but he is. Hmm-hmm. Angela. Won't you sit down, Freddie? I think so. Over there? - Sit down? - Please. Gee, you're pretty. I bet you say that to all the girls. Yes, it don't go over so good with the boys. You're sweet. And to think that they suspect you of murdering Strickland. It's ridiculous. Yes, and if they ever give me the gas chamber, they're hangin' the wrong man, and they'll be sorry. Have you any idea who the real murderer is? Yes. Who? The culprit. But who is the culprit? - Well? - The murderer. Casey has a full report on him. He has to find out only one thing before he can put him in jail. - What's that? - If he did it. - If who did it? - The culprit. - Who is the culprit? - The murderer. Don't you understand? Freddie, if you could prove who did it, you'll be a hero, and I just adore heroes. Why don't you get him to sign a confession? Get who to sign a confession? - The murderer. - Who's the murderer? The culprit, don't you understand? Yes, yes, I do. If I get the murderer to sign a confession, that will prove that I'm innocent. Why couldn't I think of something like that? Ooh, if I only had a pencil and paper, I would, you know what I would do if? Thank you. I'll dictate, you write. Hmm-hmm. Start. I hereby confess. - You did it? - Oh, no, Freddie. Write. I hereby confess to the murder of Amos Strickland. Now sign it. Me sign it? Certainly, you are the witness. Then when the real murderer signs it, everyone will know who got the confession out of him. Huh. Yeah, that's right. Freddie Phillips. Pretty good. Boy, will Casey be proud of me. Oh, don't tell Casey, we'll keep it a secret. Okay. Excuse me, there's someone at the door. Ah. For me? I took the liberty of ordering this. - That'll be all. - Yes, ma'am. I thought it might be fun to have a little champagne. Gee, I never thought I'd live a life like this. I've got a report on every one of ya, thanks to Mr. Strickland's secretary. Now, you've all had enough experience with the law to know that the sooner you start cooperating, the sooner we'll get this case over with. Okay, who's gonna speak up? Nobody, huh? Inspector, I've gotta talk to ya right away. Inspector, I've cracked this case wide open, I've got the murderer for ya: Mike Relia. Maybe that's why we can't find him. You got any proof? Sure, I sent his fingerprints down to headquarters, and I've got the complete report. You know, he was defended on a murder rap by Strickland in 1940. Old stuff, Casey, we know all that. Wait a minute, it matches in with the telegram he received, that's your motive. Sure, except for one thing. Outside of the girl, everyone in that room received a similar telegram. And they've all got just as much to lose as Mike Relia. - Crandall too? - Crandall too. Sorry, Casey, keep on tryin'. Sergeant, send Mike Relia and Miss Gordon in here. I've got two men looking for 'em now. Not Angela Gordon. Yep, she was once tried for feeding her husband champagne cocktails. Two jiggers of champagne to one jigger of poison. Holy smokes, she's up in Freddie's room. I saw the champagne wagon headed that way. They're having cocktails right now. What? There's a poison antidote in the doctor's office. Let's go. I'm hurt, Freddie. I mixed one of my special champagne cocktails just for you and you won't even taste it. I have a confession to make. - You did it? - No! I mean that stuff, I never drink that stuff. That's like drinking poison. Oh, just one teensy-weensy sip. Oh. Oh, stop it, the bubbles is ticklin' my nose. For little Angela. I wouldn't drink it for big Angela. Cut it out, will ya? And stop pressure... Oh, drink it. Give me that glass, I've had enough of this, Angela. There you are, Inspector, see, just as I told ya. - And he drank some. - The antidote. - Wait, wait, wait. - Get him outta here. - What's goin' on here? - Quiet. I got a date with a girl. - What is that? - Mustard and milk. - Mustard and milk. - Mustard and milk? - Come on. - I got a girl over here. This is an outrage. I told them who you are, Miss Gordon, you can stop pretending. Why, you. I also gave the Inspector the background on your playmates, including that fake swami from Brooklyn. What else have you got? - Flour and water. - Swell. What are you doing to me? - Quiet, quiet. - I gotta... Hey. - I'll give you the head... - Save your strength. When are you gonna start cooperating with us, Miss Gordon? Inspector, I'll do anything you say, but please don't let my name get into the newspapers, I'm engaged to be married and it would wreck my life. What else have you got? Sweet oil and lime. - Swell, all right... - Casey, Casey. - Take it easy, Freddie. - I'll take care of ya. Who killed Strickland, Miss Gordon? I don't know, Inspector. Please believe me, if I knew anything at all, I'd tell you. - What else you got? - Atropin and belladonna. Casey, Casey. Oh, get in there, get in there. I'll tell you, Inspector, there's nothing in that drink. We'll find out soon enough. In the meantime, I'm holding you. I've tried everything, given him everything. Nothing happened. See? Casey, what are you doin' to me? Sorry about the rough treatment, Freddie, but that champagne cocktail might've been poisoned. Poison, poison, poison? Are you tryin' to tell me that, oh. What are you, oh, oh. I didn't even drink the stuff. Well, why didn't you tell me? Every time I opened my mouth, you kept pouring something down it. Oh, oh. What good is this confession if that bellboy is still around? You've let us down, Angela. We were all rather surprised when the police found there was nothing in the drink. Why, you don't think I intended to kill him. I just wanted to get him drunk and put him on the slow boat to Shanghai or some place. Not permanent enough, my dear, he'd come back. If Mike Relia hadn't left, he'd know how to get us out of this situation. Well, I've done my part, I got the confession. I suppose it's up to me. This bellboy will commit suicide tonight and this will be found beside the body. Suicide? I have ways. You are in a deep sleep, a sound sleep. You hear nothing but the sound of my voice. You will do as I say, you will obey without question. Open your eyes. Freddie, your future is black. A terrible fate awaits you, you have nothing to live for. - But you have one escape. - Escape. Yes, eternal sleep. The sleep that brings peace. The sleep that goes on forever. I may as well be dead. That's right, Freddie. Stand up. Stand up? Obey me, do as I say. Now walk. Stand on the foot of the bed. Put the noose around your neck. Now, when I count three, jump. One. Two. Three. Sit up, Freddie. Stand up on the floor. Take the noose from 'round your neck. We'll have to try something else. Freddie, do you have a gun? Then get it. Do you have the gun, Freddie? Then don't delay. Put it to your head and use it. No, no, no. Maybe you'd like to select your own means of self-destruction. How would you like to die? Old age. Freddie. Come to the window. Climb up on the sill. Now then, Freddie, jump. Not into the room, out of the window. Now climb up again. You're going to commit suicide if it's the last thing you do. Now then, take this knife. Use it. Freddie. Listen to me. You will do as I tell you. You will obey me without question. Freddie, I want you to take this knife and plunge it into your heart. Do as I say. Amazing, even under hypnosis the will of an idiot to cling to life. Freddie, would you plunge this knife into the heart of the man in the mirror? Good. Then take the knife. Plunge it into the heart of the man in the mirror. No, no! No, Freddie, not me. Not me, you fool. The man in the mirror. Freddie, obey me. The man in the mirror. - Hey! - Freddie. Freddie, Freddie, Freddie. Freddie, wake up, what is this? Gimme that knife. What's the idea of chasing me around with a knife? How could be chasing you, Casey, I'm in bed. Get in. Wait a minute. What am I doin', I must be sleepwalkin'. What's the meaning of this? I must've walked on the ceiling too. Hmm-hmm. Casey, what a dream I had. Never mind your dream. Relia's run out, and we've gotta find him and make him talk. Now, put on your clothes while I wash my hands. Hurry up. How'd I ever make it up there? I must've come up this way, up this side wall and guess walked over that way. Probably got chewing gum on my feet. Hi. Casey. Casey, Casey! What's the matter? What's the matter, what's this all about? - What are you do. - Casey. What are you trying to say? Get out of the way. It's Mike Relia. He's dead. He's been stabbed. Now, you didn't do this while you were sleepwalking, did ya? I wouldn't kill anybody, you know that. I know it, but do the cops know it? They find this out, it'll be curtains for you, boy. We've gotta get this body back into its own room. - What'll we do? - Yeah, what'll we do? Yeah, what'll we do? I'll get a laundry cart, you get that body out of there. Well, come on, get some life into it. Don't you think that's askin' a little too much? Come on, Freddie, we've gotta get this body back to its room. I still don't know why I can't wear my brown suit. Oh, that's so nobody'll recognize you when you're pushing this cart down the corridor. Now, come on, make it snappy. Come on. Come on, Freddie, let's get rid of this body. Come on, come. Freddie. Freddie, where are ya now? - Freddie. - Here I am. Come on. How am I? - Oh, hello Casey. - Hello, Inspector. Maid, would you get me an extra bath towel? I'd be delighted, yes. Get a bath towel for the inspector. By the way, any news on the murder, Inspector? I'm expecting a phone call from Stone that'll pin it on that bellboy. You're keepin' an eye on him, aren't you? Yes, everything's in hand. I say, everything's in hand. Hurry up with that towel. The dumbest maid we have in the hotel. I've been speaking to the boss in regards to firing her several times, but nothing happens. Maybe she knows where the body's buried. I don't know. Here's your towel. Thank you. You're welcome. My phone. Come on, come on, push. Hey, shall we dump him in bed? Oh, certainly not, let's put him in the closet. Let somebody else find him. Closet. Open it up, hurry, put the light on. Thatta boy. Come on, push it in. Atta boy, put him right up on the shelf here, will ya. I'll get the sheet off him. Take it easy. Chin up. Give me a hand over here. Get it, quick. All right, come on, let's get outta here. Come on, hurry up. Turn out that light. Come on. Wait a minute. If they find that cart in there, Wellman might tie this up to you. - Go get the cart. - Go get the cart. - Go get the cart. - Go get the cart. Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up. - Come on, come on. - That's all I do. Go get the cart. It's all I do is all the work. Come on, come on. Come on, hurry up. Get it out there. Come on, make it snappy. - Move it right in here. - Okay. Before somebody comes along and catches us. That's right, get rid of it. Hey, put it right in there. Push it, push it. Hurry up, hurry up. Close the door, close the door. - That's a load off my mind. - Oh boy, and how. Come on, so, are you excited? Oh boy. Am I glad that's over with. I want to thank you for everything. You know, we were in a mess there for a couple minutes. Yes. Now, get right out of that disguise, and hurry up. Here, I'm tired out, I'm gonna lie down for a while. Take care of these things and don't disturb me. Casey! Didn't I tell you not to disturb me? And you haven't hung up my hat and coat yet. What's the matter with you? I can't depend on you at all anymore. No, no! Where's the cart, where's the cart? - Right there. - Oh. Scared you, didn't it? Mm-hmm, I'll confess. - You did it? - Oh, certainly not. Ya big dope. It's Milford, Strickland's secretary. What's he hangin' around here for? He's dead, ya dope. We've gotta get this body out of here, - get the cart ready. - Okay. - What's the matter now? - Right there. It's Relia. Hey, wait a minute, we just left him down in his room. There's something funny going on here. - Uh-huh. - Dead men can't walk. This one did. He did, he did. What are we going to do now? I don't know. We can't go back to Relia's room. No. We might bump into the Inspector again. Yeah. - I got an idea. - What? We can take 'em both down to the card room, there's nobody playin' cards at this hour of the night. We take 'em down there and dump 'em off. Good idea, kid, good idea. Come on, give me a hand with this body. - Casey. - What? Maybe they don't play cards. Maybe they don't, will you talk sense, please? Get these bodies out of here. Come on. Oh, oh maid. Say, you're new here, aren't you? Yes, it's my first night. Well, you certainly must have been busy. Mmm. Look at all this laundry. Don't do that, don't do that, you. Say, you know something? You're kinda cute. Look, why don't you let your work go for a while and stay down here and keep me company. Things have been awfully dead around here tonight. Much deader than you think. Oh, you. Oh no, you don't, now. Don't do it. Hey. What's going on here? It's getting so that a poor working girl isn't safe anymore. Oh, excuse me, the desk phone. Come on, let's get outta here. Come on now, get rid of these bodies. Okay, I'll get 'em out. What are you talking that way for? I don't know, I'm all mixed-up. Get rid of the bodies. Who? Freddie Phillips, the bellboy? No, Inspector Wellman, I haven't seen him. No, sir, nobody's left the hotel tonight. Casey? Oh yes, he's down here now. Oh, you'll be down, okay. Let's get out of here. Uh-oh, here comes Abernathy. Come on, get rid of that. There's nothing like a nice, sociable game of bridge. Oh, I love bridge. Bridge? With two open hands? Oh, we're playing with two dummies. Mm-hmm. Hold on, there's a card on the floor, his hand's dead. They're both dead. Oh no, you don't, no, that's peeking. Oh, he's always cheating. - Have you got a match? - Mm-hmm. Here's a match. Here, here. Who got the bid? She did. - What'd she bid? - Grand slam. You bid a grand slam on that hand? Yes. You know what? What? You're going to get murdered. Excuse me. You oughta have me for a partner, the one you've gots a stiff. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to get you all excited that way. Really, I didn't. You know I wouldn't do that for the world, don't you? You know that. Get your hand off me. Get your hand off me! I am partially engaged. Now, you leave me alone! No more. No, what's the matter? I wanna talk to you, come here. You're so strong. Now that you dragged me out here, what do you want? How 'bout a little smack? Hmm? You know, just a little smack. Mm-hmm. Hm. What happened? Well, he asked for a smack, so I gave it to him. Get that wagon outta here, change those clothes, I'll go out and see if the coast is clear. Okay. Sorry, fellas, but you'll have to play two-handed. Here comes Wellman and Stone. Casey, I been lookin' for you. Where's that bellboy? - What bellboy? - Freddie. Oh, Freddie, I know, Freddie Kitzmeyer from Philadelphia. Now there's a regular kid. I mean Freddie Phillips. Freddie Phillips? You mean that little, round, chubby sort of, - with the black hair? - That's right. The bellhop? He was fired. I know he was fired. What are you tryin' to pull? No, no, no, no, no, no. For a minute, I thought you were tryin' to hide somethin'. - Who, me? - Yeah, you. Where's Phillips? I wish I knew. What a detective. I told you not to let Phillips out of your sight. Well, he's too fat to slip down a rat hole, where is he? Now Inspector, I've told you 10 times, I don't know. Maybe he's up in his room. No, we stopped there on our way down here. Stone, phone headquarters, tell 'em to get a dragnet out. - Hey, you. - Yes? Yes! You and I are gonna have a little talk. I agree with you, let's talk over here some place where I, we'll talk right here. Let's go upstairs, it's more comfortable. I don't wanna go upstairs, my room's a mess up there. All right, Phillips, what do you know about the murder? Which one, there was three of 'em. Three of 'em, there was a papa bear, a mama bear and a teeny... Never mind the fairy tales. Why did you kill Strickland? I didn't kill him. I told you boys that before, he's too dumb. Yeah, well, what do you call this? Could be ashes. Right, we found it in this guy's room. Had it analyzed, it's the remains of a linen handkerchief. Well now, a burned handkerchief can't prove anything. It does when our tests proved that it had blood stains on it. I burned it. Oh, so you admit it? - Oh no, you see, Mr. - Strickland, he was in the room, he was layin' there dead. I don't know anything like that. I saw the handkerchief right over there. Wait a minute. I had the handkerchief in my hand. Why didn't you tell me this before? I ain't got any sense. I thought maybe everybody'd think I was the murderer. - A handkerchief. - Yeah, the handkerchief. Might have had a monogram on it or a laundry mark. Yeah, it could've. That one piece of evidence could have led us to the murderer. I think it has. You stop looking at me. Don't jump at conclusions, Sergeant. Let's go upstairs and talk it over peacefully. No, no, now stop, no, stay here. Tell us one thing, Phillips. Were you and Relia in cahoots? The last time I saw Relia, he didn't talk to me. Could only find Relia, I could make him talk. If you could, it'd be a good trick. He can make him talk, you don't know Wellman. You don't know Relia. Quit stallin', I think he's hiding upstairs in your room. - There's nobody there. - Let's go up and find out. Might be a good idea, let's ride up and find out. I'm done, I'm done. Are you coming with me? I'm comin'. I'm such a young boy, too. Hey fellas, you can come up now. Come on, stick with me. Blood. Take it easy, lady, pull yourself together. What happened? I've been trying to get in here all evening, but no one answered. So, I finally let myself in and then I saw that. - Whose room is this? - Mr. Milford. Strickland's secretary, huh? This case is gettin' screwier every minute. You go to your room, I'll call you if I need you. Any of you people seen Mr. Milford in the last few hours? I was in the lobby quite late, I didn't see him go out. Okay, we'll start with you, Swami. What are you doing fully dressed at this hour? Just a little game of cards with Mr. Brooks. - And you? - I was the third hand. And naturally, you two were there? - Naturally. - Naturally. Oh, that makes it pretty convenient, doesn't it? One for all and all for one as far as the alibis are concerned. - And you, Mr. Crandall? - I couldn't sleep. I went out for a walk. Do we take your word or did somebody see you? I was with him. You people can go back to your rooms. Not you, Phillips or Casey. The rest of you stay here. - What about me? - You can go. You too, Wilson. I'd like to remain, if I may, Inspector. You see, the reputation of the hotel is involved. Okay. Betty. I don't get it. Why didn't you want me to tell him we were out on the terrace together? Please don't ask me, Jeff. And thanks for not giving me away. Someone in this room knows a lot more than he or she is admitting, and I intend to find out who it is. Are you making an accusation, Inspector? Maybe. You all had a motive for killing Strickland, to prevent his memoirs from being published. Last night he was murdered. Tonight, his secretary disappears. Maybe he's still alive, maybe he isn't. He isn't. How do you know? Because, I mean, 'cause that spot on the carpet, that ain't ketchup there. Well, it could mean that Milford has been murdered. On the other hand, it might be a red herring. Oh no, that's not red herring, that looks more like borscht. You don't have to waste any more time, Inspector. You've got your murderer. I thought so too, Mr. Melton, but Phillips has come up with an airtight alibi. Thanks, Inspector. Did you hear that, Casey? I got an airtight alibi. I'm going to locate Milford and Relia if I have to take this hotel apart with my own hands. Nobody leaves this hotel without my permission. You can all go now. Not you, Casey. Oh, not you, Casey, huh? I'm sorry you're one of the suspects. I'll do everything I can to get you out, though. Phillips, I want to talk to you. - Me? - Yeah. You're in this thing up to your neck, but there was something phony about that bunch of creeps bein' fully dressed at this hour, so I'm gonna give you one more chance to clear yourself. Now look, I'm getting sick and tired of everybody accusing me of murder. You could be the murderer, yourself. What are you trying to do, get away? - Shut up! - Casey, Casey! - Now, take it easy. - You promised. - Now listen to me. - Talk to him, Casey. As long as Phillips was under suspicion, the real killer, if he wasn't Phillips, felt safe. But now he's gonna be pretty anxious to get that handkerchief back. So, Phillips, you're gonna put the handkerchief up for sale. Who's gonna buy a lot of ashes? Nobody but us knows that you burned it. Hey, I get it, I get it. I get it too. The one that buys the handkerchief - is the murderer. - Exactly. Oh. So spread the word around that you've got the handkerchief and that you'll sell it for, say about $5,000. Sure. And don't try to blow in the meantime. You sure you're smart enough to handle this? - Him? - I'm plenty smart. I'm going up to my hotel room right now, figure the whole thing out. - Yeah? - Yeah. Where's your hotel key? - In my pocket, where I. - Is that so? I had it. - Here it is. - Oh. I didn't get this for nothing, you know. Here it is. Hey, come on. Where'd you ditch the bodies? - In the elevator. - In the elevator? - In the elevator. - Come on. We gotta get rid of those bodies. Not that one, this one over here. There's no bodies in there. That's what I'm trying to tell you, some dirty crook stole 'em. Well, at least we're rid of 'em. Now we've got to find someone who's willing to pay $5,000 for that handkerchief. Now, wait a minute, Casey. Suppose the murderer hasn't got the money? Well then, they're apt to murder you to get it back. Either way, they'll show their hand. Well, if they murder me, I'm apt to be killed. That's right. But at least you've proven your innocence. - That's true. - Sure. One way or another, I can't lose. - That's right. - Ain't I a lucky stiff? Lucky stiff, I should've never left Paterson. Come on, let's go upstairs. I tell you, I don't need a handkerchief. I have plenty. But I'll let you have this handkerchief very cheap, only $5,000. $5,000, you're insane. Oh, but it's such a beautiful handkerchief. It's really nothing to sneeze at. Neither is $5,000. Oh please, please buy the handkerchief. If you do, I'll let you have it very cheap, I'll let you on the easy payment plan, $3500 down and small monthly payments. - 15 months. - No. - 18 months. - No. 21 months is as far as I can go. - No. - No. Ay, yi. - How'd you make out? - Oh, no good. Listen, nobody wants to buy that handkerchief. It's cheaper to kill me. I wish they'd quit stallin' and get around to it. They're getting around to it, all right. Oh look, it's only a kitten. Bet somebody's puttin' him up to it. Better luck next time. Now they got the Indians after me. Hey paleface, give me my arrow. You. Another false alarm. I wish somebody'd do something to you, I'm becoming a nervous wreck. Disgusting, isn't it? Have you talked to everybody about that handkerchief? Everybody but Mr. Brooks. Brooks, I just saw him going in the health club. Say, Freddie, this is your last bet. If he's the killer, you'll be vindicated. If he's the killer, I'll be perforated, assassinated, exterminated and marinated. Well, that's that. Just a little longer, Mr. Brooks. All right. Right here, Freddie. - This my stall? - That's right. - Hello, Mr. Brooks. - Hello. Takin' a steam bath, huh? Naturally. You know, for a steam bath to do you any good, you gotta stay in here at least 10 minutes. You gotta find something to do while you're here. Wanna play cards? Mr. Brooks, do you catch many colds? No, why? Psst-psst, I got a handkerchief I'd like to sell you. Cheap. $5,000. Why, that's ridiculous. Hmph. That's enough. You know, Mr. Brooks, the way you're perspirin' now, you could use that handkerchief. It's a big one. I'll take my rubdown in my room, Bozzo. Okay, Mr. Brooks. I'll get you in a minute, Freddie. Okay, Mr. Bozzo. Mr. Brooks! I'd like to talk to you for another minute. Oh, ho, you. Guy never gave me a chance to cut my price. He coulda chiseled me a little bit. That's all. If you. Casey! Inspector, I still say, if you let me sweat that bellhop a little, I'll get a confession out of him. Okay, if nobody falls for the handkerchief gag, he's all yours. There's still a chance that Brooks is the killer. Freddie's working on him now. Well, you got until tonight to prove it. There's a train goin' outta here at nine o'clock, and that bunch of creeps are plannin' to take it. You're not gonna let 'em, are you? They know as much about the law as I do. I've either gotta book 'em or let 'em go. I haven't got a thing on 'em. Help, help! The hotel's burning! Hey, it's the health club. Freddie's in there, come on. Freddie, Freddie. Hey Casey. Freddie, where are you? Casey. Wait'll I turn off the steam. Get him out of there, quick. Whew. How do you like that, somebody's trying to cook my goose. What do you mean? I saw a hand come around the corner and he put on a lot of steam. A lot of steam, all the steam he could put on. Full force. I think somebody's trying to kill me. Sounds phony to me. Yeah, maybe you're just tryin' to divert suspicion for yourself. You're not as dumb as you look. Get your hand off me. Now, I've had enough of you, Inspector. I don't want anymore of this from you. After all, I'm a citizen and I'm a taxpayer, and it's my taxes that buys you your gun and your badge. And it's my taxes that also pays you your salary every week. You're workin' for me. You're nothin' but a public servant. So what? Get me another bottle of water. Okay. What! Well, the Inspector's not foolin' with you anymore. You heard what he said, if nothing develops by nine o'clock tonight, he's gonna place a formal charge of murder against you. Murder? So what, are you nervous? - Murder? - Gimme the key. Absolutely. Wait a minute. What's wrong? Stand back. Get in, get in. What's the matter with you? What in the world is that? - It's a booby trap. - What for? For boobs. I'm not taking chances of anyone sneakin' in here and killin' me without me knowing it. Ah, ya big dope. What's to prevent anybody from coming in those French doors? Ah. It's pretty good, isn't it? That is the most ridiculous thing I have ever seen. - Is that so? - Yeah. Well, let me tell you something, if the murderer comes in this room by himself, somebody else is gonna carry him out. Why, you dirty double-crosser. Here we've got it all arranged to have somebody try and kill you, and you're trying to prevent it. Ya know. Come here, come here. Look at this, I suppose you've got these windows rigged up too? Oh, they can't hurt me here. We're three stories up. Boy, are you lucky. Somebody's finally trying to bump you off, congratulations. Wait until the Inspector hears about this. Oh boy, oh boy. Yeah, yeah, get me Inspector Wellman. Oh, look at those bullet holes, marvelous, wonderful. Casey, why is everybody so happy I'm gonna be killed? Boy, are they really after you. Oh, come, come, put a smile on your face. That's a boy. Sure, enjoy life. That's it. Go on, go in the other room and lie down. Go in and rest. - Relax, go ahead. - I will. Sure, go ahead. That's swell. What, he's not in his room? Well, page him in the lobby. Everybody's so happy I'm gonna get murdered. I don't understand nothin' about the whole thing. Uh-oh. Every time I open up one of those closet doors, I always find a dead body. Is there anybody in there, hmm? Ah. Ah. Casey? Casey. I didn't hear you come in. You're supposed to be out there talkin' to Inspector Wellman. Now, you know, people all around here, they're all dyin' to kill me, and here you come in resting. Oh you, Casey. You oughta be ashamed, you oughta be embarrassed. That's why you got your face all covered up. Now, come on. Now, Casey, what was the matter with the dark suit? You look good in that one. Fine. What's the matter, what's the matter, Freddie? Freddie, what's wrong, what happened? - Come in. - Take it easy. I wanna show you something. - Take it easy. - There he is, over there. It's all right, so you messed up the bed. What about it, go and relax. No, he was here. - Who? - Milford. Milford. Now wait a minute, are you trying to tell me that Milford's body was there and it's gone? Take care of yourself, take it easy. Go get yourself a drink of water. Yeah, that'll fix you up, go ahead. Take it easy, take it easy. Don't get excited, go ahead. Wait a minute, what's the matter now? - Now what? - Milford. Where? Must be a leak in the tub. Oh, come here. Keep quiet. There's nobody in this suite. Now, shut up. Just to satisfy ya, I'll check. You get on the phone and see if the Inspector's on his way up. Hurry up, go on. All right, all right. That boy don't know what's goin' on here. He don't know what's happening. I know I saw it in there before. And when I go back, it ain't there. And I was in the other room over there, I went in to gargle my throat, and I go down like that, I saw it. I saw it was in the bathtub over there. I know I'm not losin' that, I know that. I could be havin' halluc, with the nation, halluke-inations, but I know I saw it. Hello? Hello. What's a matter now? What are you, what are? Come here. Come on, let me in on it, now what? What? Oh, no, no, not again. You mean to tell me that Milford was there? - He was there. - Oh. Now, listen. I am getting sick and tired of this nonsense of yours. - He was there. - Don't tell me that. Milford was there, Milford was there, Milford was there. How could he be, the man is dead. For a dead man, he's sure gettin' around. Listen, I'm gonna prove to you once and for all that he's not here. Is he there? No. Come here, come here, is he there? - No. - No. Come here, come on. All right. - Is he there? - Yes. - Milford! - Cover it up. There's something strange goin' on here. Somebody's tryin' to scare you out of this room. - I know who it is. - Who? Him. That's the Inspector. We've gotta get rid of him before he finds this body in here, come on. Come on. Hello Inspector, I'm sorry to have bothered you, but I found out it was all a mistake. It was just his imagination. That's right, Inspector. You see those three bullet holes in the window? That's only my imagination. That's all. Where were you when these shots were fired? I was sittin' right here, but not for long. Mike Relia! Casey, do you think I'm in the right room? Yes. Stone, go in the bedroom and get a sheet. Not in the bedroom, not that one. - Shut up. - Sure. - Shut up. - Shut up. I ain't said nothin'. Well, Phillips, what do you know about this? Oh, sure, sure. What do you know about this? Quit stallin', now you got two murders to explain. Better make it three, Inspector. Milford. I pulled the spread down and there he was. Freddie. No, Freddie couldn't have done this, Inspector. These bodies were planted here. That's right, this one was planted over here, it was... Hey. Look, Inspector, I don't understand the whole thing. In the suite here, I got every door locked, you can't get in or out. That whole room in there is all laid with booby traps. I'll prove it, come on, I wanna show it to you. Come on, everybody. Look, Inspector. What in the world is that thing? Well sir, I'm gonna show you how it works. Look, you see, while I go outside and leave my room, as soon as I go outside, I leave the door open just a little bit, and I reach in with my hand and I take this and I put it on the doorknob like that, you get it? Now, if somebody should happen to come in, the door opens up, pulls this down like this, this pulls this down and quaff, hits you right on the head. Then I got French doors over there, but I got 'em all rigged up. I'm not worried about these windows because nobody can come in, we're three flights up. And that door over there, that leads to Mr. Crandall's apartment. And Mr. Crandall's a neat man, he wouldn't leave any bodies lying around. I'm afraid he did this time. Phillips is telling the truth. I brought those bodies in here. Is that a confession, Crandall? Pf course not, my uncle had nothing to do with the murders. Excuse me, Inspector. Are you the guy that's been playin' hide-and-seek with Milford and me? I don't know what you're talking about. I found the bodies in my room, Inspector, I got panicky. There was no other place, I brought them here. How could you find the bodies in your room? I put 'em in the elevator. Zip it! Now you put your foot in it. That's good enough for me. Frederick Phillips, I place you under arrest for the charge of willful and premeditated homicide. Thank you, Mr. Crandall, Miss Crandall, I may want to talk to you later. Fine, Inspector. Okay, Phillips, spill it. Why did you kill those three men? I didn't kill 'em. I don't go around killin' people. But all the evidence points to me. Take me down. Freddie Phillips. What did you say, Inspector? That wasn't me. Freddie Phillips. Did you call me? Freddie Phillips. Freddie Phillips. Hey, it's comin' from over here. Freddie Phillips. Did I scare you with the bodies? - You sure did. - Shh. Then listen carefully. If you don't want to die, come to the caverns at 7:30 tonight. Bring the handkerchief. I'll be on the west bank of the bottomless pit. Tell nobody and come alone. Come alone, come alone. Persistent, isn't he? That's a phonograph record. It's probably homemade, it's coming from the basement. Anyone recognize the voice? I don't know anybody who lives in there. Inspector, I think our plan has finally worked out. Freddie'll go to the caverns tonight and he'll catch the murderer red-handed. Freddie, this is the last chance to clear yourself. I'm not gonna go down to the caverns all by myself, I'm afraid. Wait a minute. Would you rather die a hero or live like a rat? - Well? - Get the cheese ready. Casey, look. It says do not enter. Shucks, just when I was lookin' forward to goin' in there. Well, I guess that's that. Mm, mm, mm. Freddie, you go ahead alone, it's nearly 7:30. It's dark in here. Go ahead, we won't be far behind ya. And when you find the guy that wants that handkerchief, yell. Go ahead, go ahead. Do I have to? Yes. Pardon me, are you the man that wants to buy the handkerchief? You. Now, where could he have gone so quickly? Freddie, hey! - What is that? - Oh, it's only an owl. Let's find Freddie before something happens to him. Come on. Well, what do we do now? Looks like the killer's outsmarted us. We've gotta get to Freddie. There's another entrance to the bottomless pit about a half-mile down, come on. Let's go down. What's the matter? I turned my ankle. You'll have to go on without me, boys. You can't miss it, it's the first big turn to your left. Go ahead, boys, I'm going back to the hotel. Casey! Casey! Casey! Casey! Was that an echo? Was that an echo? Inspector Wellman, Sergeant Stone, Casey, are you still behind me? Inspector Wellman, Sergeant Stone, Casey, are you still behind me? I'm all alone. Oh no, you're not. Oh, yes. Hmm. Wow. That's the biggest thing I ever saw. "Beware of bottomless pit." "If lost, do not wander around." "Call for guide." Mr. Guide. Mr. Guide. I'll sit here and wait for him. Oh, I wish the guy that wanted that handkerchief would come and take me outta here. I don't like it here. A movin' rock. Hm. I gotta get another candle. Hmm. Come on. It ain't gonna work, not that one. Hey, hey. Ah. Ah. I'll get another candle. Hey, mister. Hey! What happened? Whoa. Whew. Careful, careful, I say. Hang on. Hang on, Freddie. Get up here and I'll help you. Come on. A little closer. Take my hand. Give me the handkerchief and I'll save your life. You save my life and I'll give you the handkerchief. No. I'll. Whew. This could've been serious. Casey, oh Casey. Wow. Hoo-hoo. Oh, Casey! Inspector Wellman! Hang on. Catch the rope. Throw it down, will ya? Atta boy, good work. Good work, if I can catch it. Get. Ay-yi. Hey, get the rope a little closer! Can ya get the rope a little closer! Atta boy! Oh, why do ya? Why do ya keep on? Why don't you make up your mind! Hey, I think my coat is caught. Woo. I did it, I,. Whoa. Tie it around your waist. Yeah, yeah. Are you ready? Okay, okay, first floor. Freddie! Freddie Phillips! Now, I'll have the handkerchief. I haven't got it. But if you get me outta here, I'll take you where it is. It's in my room, I'll take you there. I'll find out where. What are ya doin'? What are ya doin'? What are ya doin'! In two minutes, the water will be over your head. Casey! Casey! Casey! Casey! Where are you, Phillips? I think it came from over there. Inspector Wellman! A fine way to end up, a drain plug. He isn't in here. Look. Where's Casey? Nevermind Casey, did you see who the killer was? The killer did it. Did you see who he was? No, he had a slicker on and a mask on his face. What about the handkerchief? I told him it was in my bedroom. Come on, we've still got a chance to nab him. Oh, oh, ho, my trap, it worked. I got him, I got him! My trap got the killer. Come on, get it up. Ho, ho. I knew it was gonna work. Get that killer up. Casey. You lunatic, why didn't you tell me you reset that thing? I set that trap to catch the killer. Oh, so you must be the killer. Nonsense. What are you doin' up here, anyway? My ankle hurt, I come up to lay down. That's a likely story. You come up here to get the handkerchief. - You're crazy. - Is that so? Well, it's all beginnin' to add up now. Casey, you're tryin' to frame me. You're the only guy who was in the room here with me when the body was being moved around. Shh. Not only that, I wouldn't put it past you if it wasn't your voice that come outta the ventilator. Well you dope, you were standing right alongside of me. So, you're a ventriloquist, huh? Look Freddie, don't talk like that, I'm your friend. My friend? You're tryin' to kill me. Inspector, I demand that you arrest this homicidal maniac. Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't. There's nothin' I can do to help you now. Freddie, stop puttin' ideas in the Inspector's head. He doesn't need to, and I'm glad you're all here. It saves the trouble of me sendin' for you. Come on in and sit down. Sergeant. - Casey's the murderer. - Shh, quiet. Caught him red-handed all by myself. No help whatsoever from the Inspector. - Shh, quiet. - I caught him. Caught him all by myself. Mr. Melton, the murderer. Will you stop that? I've known for some time why Amos Strickland was killed: To keep him from finding out that his secretary Milford had been blackmailing Crandall. - Milford? - Exactly. Amos Strickland knew nothing about it. When you phoned him that you wouldn't pay another penny, he came down here, not to put the pressure on, but to find out more about it. But Milford couldn't have killed Strickland, he was 400 miles away. So he must've been working with somebody in this hotel, someone who was a partner in the blackmail. Casey, blackmailer. Now I know how you can afford to smoke them 20-cent cigars. You killed Strickland so he couldn't get to Crandall who had the goods on you. - Freddie. - Ah, ah, ah. Freddie, you shouldn't talk like that. After all, we're cousins. We have the same blood in our veins. Yes, and I wanna keep mine. Milford knew Strickland was going to be killed, so he rounded up a few former clients to have them on the scene in order to throw suspicion in many directions. Please. What about the memoirs? They were a fake. Milford invented them to get you down here. Strickland had no intention of retiring. And any lawyer that would publish a book like that could never expect to get another client. Pretty cute, eh? You and Milford? I wanna tell you somethin', I'm glad they caught you. Look Freddie, please, please. See that folks, you see that? - He's tryin' to choke me. - Freddie! You see that, he don't know his own strength. Freddie. Did you see it that time? Like that, ah. When Relia disappeared, I suspected that he was Milford's accomplice. But when both Relia and Milford were found dead, I knew that I had to look some place else. And you're lookin' at him now. Stop that. Freddie, believe me, I'm innocent. You're innocent? You're innocent? Well, let me tell you somethin'. I forgot what I was gonna say, you lucky boy. Why Relia was murdered is one of the angles of this case that still puzzles me. I have a theory, Inspector. You remember the murderer stole Relia's gun for the killing. Well, perhaps Relia found out about it and had to be put out of the way. A brilliant deduction, Mr. Melton. You're right, Inspector. Yeah, it was Casey. He put the gun in my room so everybody would be suspicious of me. But Inspector Wellman, why did the killer take the bodies from the elevator and leave them in my uncle's room? - Well. - That was very obvious. Oh, will you shut up. You tell it to her. When Phillips was no longer under suspicion, the killer hoped to make Mr. Crandall number one suspect. See? I'm glad that's cleared up. Me, too. Now at this point, the killer's only remaining problem was to recover the incriminating handkerchief. The handkerchief! That's it, Casey come in here lookin' for the handkerchief and he couldn't find it. A very clever deduction, Freddie. I think so. Except for one thing, Mr. Melton. Casey was one of the few of us that knew there was no handkerchief. Phillips had burned it. Inspector, I found what we were looking for. Thank you, Sergeant. I have a confession to make. - You did it? - Oh, no, no, no. I kept you here in order to to give Sergeant Stone a chance to go through your rooms and luggage. Now, there's mineral mud in the caves, so whoever was in there a few minutes ago would have it on their shoes. All right, everybody, get back against that wall. Quick! Don't try anything, Melton, you can't get away. I think I can. Are you going out that door? - I am. - A-ha, ha. That's in case the big one didn't work. Well, there he is, Inspector. Get him outta here. Well, now that I solved the murder, I want all you folks to go down to the Champagne Room and have some lemonade, it's on me. Nice work, Freddie, you can have your job back, too. Thank you, Mr. Crandall, thank you. Casey, something I gotta tell you. What's that? Never once did I believe you were the murderer. I knew it all the time. I was usin' you as a decoy. - It's okay, kid. - Okay, Casey. See you downstairs. Nice fella. Freddie, I wanna congratulate you. Without all those booby traps, we could have never solved this murder. Thank you ever so much. I'm gonna make a change now, I wanna get out of these wet clothes. Sure. Yee. This one, I completely forgot about.
