Andiamo! Bandaliro! Andiamo! Andiamo. There is a village down in the valley. The Grim Reaper! Jakub, I’ve been waiting for you for so long, and you wanted to escape me. Me... But why? Don’t be afraid, just come to me. Gotya! Let go of me, you bastard! Let me go! You little brat! Aren’t you scared of Death? I will soon finish you off! Just one move with my scythe. Move, you old bag! Or I will break your bones! I haven’t met anyone who could break Death’s bones. I like the boy. I could use someone like him. I have to help him. No. Don’t you dare using the scythe, Death! And from behind, shame on you! Hold on tight, get ready for the ride! Move, you old bag! You’re in my way! Sister Snow Fairy, you are helping him! You’ve got no right to do that! My scythe... I’ve got no power without it! I’ve got you! You spoiled brat! Who can save me now? Help! Snow Fairy, you betrayed me! Snow Fairy! Yes, yes, Death, I shall help you. Don’t scream. But Jakub shall be mine. THE SNOW FAIRY Making snow is very hard work, Jakub. Up and down, let’s shake this bed. Let snow fall all over the land. Jakub, where are you? Have you been lazy again? I’m here, Snow Fairy. Move aside. Excellent! You’re almost good as me. Up and down, let’s shake this bed. Let snow fall over the land! And now we’re going to look how it’s snowing down there. Snow Fairy, why is it that somewhere it’s snowing and elsewhere it’s raining? It’s how it’s meant to be. Can you make it snow in the desert? Please, Snow Fairy, do it for me. Why would you want me to do that? Why? Because it will be pretty, Snow Fairy. But it’s not right. It will turn the world upside down. Please, please... All right. Look, Jakub, what we’ve done. These people have never seen real snow before in their lives. From now on we’ll make it snow only in places where it will cover the land with a white coat. The earth will rest then, and give bread to the people. And them? What are they doing? Those are children, playing games. Look at that window, Snow Fairy. Can I draw a picture on it? Of course you can, but no silly things. Look at the snowflakes. That little girl was so happy. Why did she have to go to sleep? You’ll see. Sleep, Alžbeta, so you can grow up. - I want to grow too, Snow Fairy. - And what for? Before I became part of this magic world, I was human, too. It’s no good. Humans grow and get older. And was I human, too? Yes, you were, but only for a very short time. Why is it not good to be human? - Why? - Humans are mortal, Jakub. Enough with the questions, it’s time to work. Work again... Today we will create a big snow storm. But you said that winter is nearly over. Very good! I don’t know what I would do without you. Yes, it’s spring time. Let’s make a warm breeze to wake up nature, so that we can have a rest. Can you see? The earth was sleeping until now. I know this song. That’s Alžbeta! How much she has grown! Wait, I’ll surprise you with something. Which kid threw that at me? By the way, where did that snow come from? It’s already spring. Jakub! You little devil! What are you doing? - Nothing! - Throwing snow balls at Alžbeta? Don’t confuse people – it’s already spring. Do you see everything? Everything. And I know what you’re thinking, too. I know you want to climb to my tower. I’d better lock the gate, my dear Jakub. I can see that you are very keen to get up there. Is that a way outside? Don’t even think about it – it could cost you your life. Snow Fairy, are you asleep? I just wanted to put a blanket on you, so you won’t catch a cold. Go back to sleep as well. Don’t be scared of me – I won’t hurt you. So this is the tower I’m not supposed to enter? What is she hiding from me? And what’s this? I think it’s for looking through, but I cannot see a thing. I should tidy up this place for her. It’s a real mess. Where’s the broom? So much clutter... spider webs... My eyes... This is so beautiful. What’s happening to me? Welcome to the world, Jakub. My clothes are getting too small now! I guess it’s true about growing up. I have grown! I have grown! I am human! Human! What is this shirt doing in the human world? My dear sister, please don’t be angry. Perhaps he threw it out through the chimney, or perhaps it’s not even his. Why do you think it’s his? Let’s have a look if he still has his shirt. Keep it down, he’s still asleep. Today it is his shirt and tomorrow himself. He would never leave me. Oh, yes, he would. Once he runs away and becomes human, I’ll be the one having problems with him. I still remember him very well. And that day you saved me from him. I don’t want to see how much trouble he will cause me. There won’t be any trouble. Don’t worry. I’ll make sure he won’t grow up. Didn’t he already grow? He’ll be the death of me, one day! He hasn’t changed at all, you say? So you’re lying to me? You both want to destroy me, but I’m much stronger! You’re exaggerating. Nothing’s wrong. You’re out to get me... The boy hasn’t changed a bit. But he... he’s grown. He must have looked outside. All right, fine. But only once. He just peeked out of the window on the tower. The lad’s got more brains than both of us together. I think I should remove the ladders, but I can’t do that on my own. Well, I can help you, if you want. But be careful. All my astrological tools are in that tower. Don’t worry. Gently... My astrological tools! Oh, that stupid scythe of mine! It doesn’t listen to me anymore! You call that helping me? I said ladders and you destroyed my tower. Forgive me, sister. I don’t know why, every time I want to do something good, I do the worst. What now? How can I help you? Enough. Basta. I don’t need your help anymore. Take your scythe and go. I just wanted to do good and help. Everybody hates me. Nobody likes Death, but I will show you all! Wind, don’t be crazy. What are you doing with the leaves? Stop it! Don’t you hear me? Stop it! A heart. I was mistaken, Wind. It is beautiful. Why are you spoiling it, Snow Fairy? It was beautiful. Yeah, beautiful... Insolent little brat, you keep upsetting me. Don’t you dare to grow again! I am the Snow Fairy! And you made me into a seamstress! Stop laughing at me. You should be glad I let you at least have a look at the world. What’s wrong, father? Mother wants to see you once more. Yes, father. Mommy... Alžbeta... Listen to your father. Everything he’ll do is good. - Yes, mommy. - It’s my time to go with her. I’m coming. Farewell. Now do you understand, dear Jakub, why I don’t want you to be human again? I’m not scared of Death. Let her come here again! She won’t be showing her face here for a while. Where is she? Where did she go? Who knows? Flying around in the world. She must be taking other lives somewhere else. Whose? We could be searching forever. Let me at least cheer up Alžbeta with a rainbow. You may do that, Jakub. I can see you like this girl a lot. She is pretty, but only human. Alžbeta, don’t cry. Don’t be sad. Alžbeta... Sister, I was looking for you. I’ll get you, I’ll get you. I’ll get you, I’ll get you. Pull me fast, pull me! Yes, Dora. Faster, faster! You won’t make her happy now. She’s in mourning now. Time will heal the pain and she’ll forget. And she’ll grow old. Will she outgrow me again? She will. You’ll stay a boy forever. You even will see her children grow up. And her grandchildren, too. No, I want to grow up! Grow up! That’s all I need. It’ll mean you will grow old and die like ordinary people. Why not? I want to be a man and marry her. Don’t be silly, Jakub. A little boy like you shouldn’t be talking like an adult. What little boy? I’m twenty years old. How do you know that? - I have been counting the days. - Then you have wasted your time. Time doesn’t pass here. Time only passes on Earth. Hey Mr Mayor, what a pretty bride you have! What’s going on down there, Snow Fairy? It’s just a wedding. Alžbeta’s father is getting married again. And Alžbeta... where is she? Look. She’s sitting right there, doing her chores. You see, you didn’t even recognise her. Yes, I did. And yet, I cannot believe how much she has grown. Hurry up with that. She looks so sad. They gave her the dirty jobs to do. I’d like to strike them all with a bolt of lightning. Don’t you dare. Then let’s at least bring her mother back to life. We don’t have that kind of power, my son. Yes, we do. Mama... Mommy! Little wench. The window... She broke the window! She broke the window! What’s this? Mama, mama, Betty broke the window! You little bitch... Are you trying to ruin your dear father’s wedding? What did your mother say when she was dying? What happened? - Did somebody hurt you, daughter? - No, father. I am happy when you are happy. And I am happy when you are. Come, let’s go. Nothing happened. Betty... That’s so unfair. I can’t look at it anymore. Sometimes it’s like this between people. Be glad you live here and not there. Alžbeta can be difficult at times. She’s so clumsy. Perhaps you’re giving her too much work. Maybe we need a new servant. Seriously? Where can you find a good servant these days? You’re right. Let her work – work won’t hurt her. She’ll learn from it. I was thinking the same thing. - We’ll make her mill. - Yes, yes, she will mill. She will mill... Mill... You’re looking up, Alžbeta, still you cannot see me. I would like to help you so much, but I don’t know how to reach you. Dear falcon, take me to her. You were flying so far, dear rooster, and yet this is where you ended up. Perhaps the wind was too weak. Snow Fairy, are you asleep? Drink up. Sleep tight. This is just a dream. Play. This wind is excellent. Play, Snow Fairy, play. Farewell, Snow Fairy! I’m sorry I’m leaving without telling you, but you were asleep! You ungrateful boy. You were supposed to take care of me until I die, and you’re leaving me instead. But you’ll live forever. You’ll never grow old. You’ll never grow old. I see you’ve gotten smarter since you’ve been living with me, Jakub. But you just wait... Just wait... I’m shall send such strong wind, you will beg me to come back. You little thief! Stealing my bed cover! So Jakub, how’s the flying? This will teach you a lesson. I’ll add some more wind, so you won’t forget. Help! Help! What’s happening to me? It hurts too much! My boy, are you all right? Help! I’m growing! Snow Fairy! I’m a man! I’m a man, Snow Fairy! Do you hear me? All right, fly away, my dear. Good luck. You’ll need it. It must be so. I’m human! Jakub the human! Let my good wind take you where your heart wants to go. Be happy! Long live the world! And long live its people! This is it. This is where she lives. I didn’t mean to scare you. Be quiet and don’t worry. I’m human too. Quiet. Hello? Hey! Anybody here? Ah, soap. Smells nice... but tastes awful. Alžbeta... Who are you? Jakub. Which Jakub? Which...? Jakub from heaven. You dress funny in heaven. Indeed. We do other silly things there. Almost as silly as you here on Earth. - And what are you doing? - I’m milling the grain for flour. Isn’t there an easier way to do that? We’ve just been waiting for you to arrive and come up with a new invention. Don’t worry, Alžbeta, I’ll think of something. But I have to be more willing. Do you hear that? - Who’s there with her? - A man, a man... It’s a male voice. Where did you learn this song? You’ll be surprised, but from you. Stop. So you let any stranger come in? What is that guy doing here? Where did he come from? From heaven. What? Heaven? How dare you make fun of me! You dirty beggar! Do you know who I am? I’m the mayor’s wife! And I’m Jakub. We’ll put you behind bars! Go ahead and try. Give it to him, mother! - Come down, you dirty beggar! - It suits you when you’re angry. Good afternoon, Mayor. What’s going on? Who is this? This must be our new servant. - No, it isn’t. - You didn’t hire him? I think it’s a great idea. You must be heaven-sent. Exactly that. The mayor is right. Yes, from heaven. And please give him some proper clothes. Go ahead. So this is what we’ve been doing together, Snow Fairy. Just giving people more work to do. What is it good for? I know you want to keep them busy, but that’s enough for today. Stop making it snow. Enough! Good morning. Jakub, who are you talking to? Oh, good morning, Alžbeta. Can’t you guess? With the Snow Fairy. You don’t say. And you know her well, I guess? Don’t you believe I came from heaven? Only yesterday I was making snow and today I’m clearing it all up. Isn’t that strange? Everything you say sounds strange. I like listening to you, even though I don’t believe a word. Tell me something about her. What does she look like? How shall I describe her? I wish she could show herself. Snow Fairy, show yourself! She doesn’t want to. But you know what? I’ll create her. Well, come and help me. Come. She looks funny. Just don’t say it out loud. She might hear you and get very upset. - She can hear me? - Oh yes, she can hear everything. - Really? - Yes. So let’s give her big ears. - What was that? - You see? She’s upset. Hey, Snow Fairy, shame on you! You’re almost as bad as Death! Let me help you. - Do you know Death? - Yes, she’s my aunt. Quite a nice lady, but she takes lives from people. Death... Christmas is coming. We need to catch some fish for the village. But how can we, now that wolves have settled by the river? Tell the servant to do it. You don’t think it’s too dangerous? If he really is so clever, surely he can deal with them. Wolves... Wolves... Wolves. Again nothing. Such misery. Someone’s coming. Ah, Alžbeta. Well? Did you catch any? No luck so far. I guess they don’t like us. I brought you some lunch for after all your hard work. Well, I guess we’ll stay hungry, then. We’d better eat now – it’s more sensible. If we don’t catch anything, the mayor will put us behind bars, and then we won’t get any food. Don’t worry, my father is a fair man. He doesn’t lock people up for such stupid reasons. He is a fair man, that much is true, but even a fair man can misjudge – especially when he is influenced by others. And he’s got someone like that. What’s that around your waist? A flute. Play for us. Play. I usually only play to the peacocks. Then let’s play to fishes. Look! A fish! Sorcery... Fish! Fish! Play. You play! Let’s catch them! We won’t be starving. Food for the entire village. They’re jumping out by themselves. - Come and dance with me. - I don’t know how. I’ll show you. Carry on dancing. Jakub, are you asleep? Of course I’m sleeping. And I’m dreaming a nice dream. - Aren’t you cold? - Cold? I’ve got this warm blanket from the Snow Fairy. It always keeps me warm. Let’s share it. Aren’t you scared of wolves? Terribly. Although I’ve never met wolves before. You’re always joking. Won’t you tell me where you really come from? Will you ever stop this nonsense? And yet I’m glad you came. You brought luck to us. We’re really lucky now! Saint Hubert protect us. Look! Wolves! Now it’s time to dance! Who just kicked me out of bed? No one will protect us now. So these are wolves. They seem hungry to me. I’m old. I will sacrifice myself and you run away. I... I will stop them. - You’re brave, but leave them to me. - All right. - Take the horses. - What about you? Don’t worry about me. Alžbeta, get on the carriage. Don’t stay here, Jakub! They will kill you! Well, wolves, it looks like Death wants to feed you my bones. Follow me! I have better bones for you! Here they are! Welcome, dear auntie! Let me go! I can be young and beautiful. Let me go! Beautiful or ugly, you’re still Death. You wanted to kill me. Let go of me! Let me go! Please stop it. I swear I will get rid of them. All right then. Show me. I’ll drop them all. I’ll show you. - There they go... - Well done, Death, but next time you’d better avoid me. Have you forgotten how I pulled your nose? Oh yes, yes, I almost forgot about it. My poor, old, forgetful head... But don’t you think you’ve won so easily! These wolves of yours have really nice fur. Too bad my blood is too hot. It will get cold, one day! This is silly. The mayor’s wife and daughter sliding slopes, and this is the result. I wonder whose idea it was – the day before Christmas. Jakub... Ah, come closer, Jakub. Come. Take an example from him. He chopped wood for the whole winter, caught fishes for the whole village, escaped the wolves that were chasing him. What you mean, chased me? I was chasing them. - He’s always joking. - Keep out of this. Alžbeta! - What is it? - Nothing. Jakub is allowed to joke, because he’s skilled. Very well, all joking aside... Let’s open the presents. Dora. Presents... - Look. - Wow... - And that one is yours. - A scarf! A scarf! My present for the family is outside. 1, 2, 3 ,4, 5, 6... Such beautiful furs! Look! We’re rich. He’s giving us a fortune! - That’s... - A fortune! And I have something... for you. Don’t open it yet. Only when you’re alone. A magical flute? And what shall I give you? You don’t have to give anything. You already gave us so much. At least this. I want this moment to last forever. No, you don’t. Let this moment pass – it will give way to new and even better ones. That is why I came to find you. We’ve got a fine servant, haven’t we? Very clever and skilled. I’m sure he’ll soon be very rich. He would make a fine son-in-law. Be quiet. Keep on dreaming. See, Snow Fairy, what a wonderful life I’m living here? I cannot even fall asleep from all this happiness. You’re right, it’s time to sleep. Good night, Snow Fairy. Don’t get your hopes up just yet. You shall have to fight for your happiness. My fingers... Can’t you be more careful? Just look what a mess you’ve made! I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to. The flax rake is very sharp. I bet you did it on purpose. Go and wash it by the well. I want it ready in a few minutes. In a few minutes... Our Dora is smart and hard-working. And her dowry is vast. Whoever makes her his wife, he won’t be disappointed. There you go. But I’d better leave you two alone. Very good. Go and seduce him. Cuckoo... Look how he’s gazing at you. Well, I’ll leave you two alone. Damn... Death is here. Alžbeta, run! Leave her alone! Don’t touch her! I didn’t even need to push her. But he’s always faster. He doesn’t want me, he wants her! No, he wants you! Listen, Death, don’t you ever lay a finger on her! Ever! Do you hear me? Fine, fine. Just make sure no one else will, instead! You’re supposed to stay in bed. You caught a cold. Isn’t it enough that I’m locking you in? I feel much better. Really? Good. Then you can continue working. But not outside. I put Jakub in charge of the peacocks. And you will finish this before evening. Cuckoo... Here’s your lunch. I made it myself. Really? How did you make it? Well... I can’t remember. But it’s very good. I ate half of it on my way here. And I could even finish half of your half. The circus! The circus! What did he say? He’s inviting us to the performance. And he said we should bring Alžbeta, too. Open the door, Alžbeta. How can I, when my stepmother locked me up? You’d better leave, or she’ll punish you as well. She doesn’t want to see us together. Alžbeta... How did you...? The door’s locked. Not for me. Let’s go outside. There’s a nice breeze. And what if they catch us? Don’t worry. Nobody is home, they all went to see the circus. - Go and open the window. - What? Just do it. Wide open! Good. - This is more like it, eh? - Wonderful! Wonderful! It’s getting bigger! Hold it firmly. Why aren’t you screaming, Alžbeta? - Aren’t you scared? - No. Not with you. Look! Look! They’re flying! Fly with us! He could easily hurt her. Shame on him. You see? And you were so fond of him. But he’s gone too far. He is a fool. I will show him. - He knows how to fly? - The Director can do anything. Thank you. What are you talking about? He’ll show us a very beautiful place. Really? How can you understand that foreign language? I’m wondering that myself. I guess it’s not so difficult, then. Well, I’ll learn it too, then. Look, how pretty. Here it is. You’ll be happy here. This is where we’ll live! - Will we live so far from my father? - He can visit us. Let’s build a mill, so we can mill for the entire village. A mill? But there’s no water here. Oh, we don’t need that. We have the wind. Let’s stay here, Alžbeta. - I... - Let’s stay here. We needn’t leave. We’ll be so happy here. Yes. A shame it’s only a dream. The peacocks... My peacocks! I forgot to let them out. Somebody’s hurting them, I can feel it. We have to hurry. You youngsters are always rushing. Quick! Youth is wonderful. How I’d like to experience it once again. By God... My peacocks! What has happened to them? You see that they all got killed. Where were you? Look what you’ve done. - It wasn’t Jakub’s fault! - Shut up! You could have ended up the same way, too. We left you in charge of the peacocks. And you didn’t let them out and let them starve. But that’s not true. Somebody murdered them. And I know who. You bastard, you fool... What are you insinuating? We were going to accept you into our family. Poor Dora almost got married to you. But I won’t let you fool me again. Get away from here. Get out of here! And don’t you dare to return to this house! I don’t need your house – I’ll build my own! And I don’t need Dora either! I’ll come back for Alžbeta! Very good, very good. Only one month has passed, and already the walls are built. As if they appeared from the water. Water is exactly what still is missing. How is Alžbeta? I told the mayor what a great job you’re doing here. He is strict but fair. They should give her to you. It would be best if they did. That way I won’t have to take her from them. - Here, drink up. - Thank you. - How can I repay you? - Oh, no need for that. Last time I gave you some fish. And now I have something even better. It’s yours. And bring me some warm clothes, next time. Gold. I can’t accept this. It’s too valuable. Gold... Send my love to Alžbeta! I will, I will. Where did you find the gold? Oh, here in this well. I might find another piece soon. I found one already! Here it is! - What? Just like the first one? - No, even bigger! I’ve struck water! Who would have thought – a water source on a hill. Water, lovely water. Watch, Dora. You could learn something from Alžbeta’s baking skills. I’m watching. I’m watching. Stop eating that. Take an example from her. I will, I will. And to make it a bit easier for her, we’ll put some sugar on top. We will. Dora! Hm, so much sugar. Just like snow. You’re spoiling me with all that sugar, Alžbeta. My stepmother and Dora put it on. You wouldn’t believe how much they’ve changed. That’s hard to believe. And perhaps they put some poison in it. Although I don’t see Death around. Well, let’s eat it, then. Perhaps they really did change. - Oh, I feel so tired. - Me too. I’ll play something so we won’t fall asleep. Play, just play. Play, play... They ate the sugar. And now they’ll sleep. Sleep, sleep... Let’s throw them in the well. Not him, you fool. You know he’s got hands of gold. If my plan goes well, he’ll be your husband. But this... could be... very... useful. Let’s wrap her in it. And her dress we’ll put beside him. We will, we will. This time he won’t save her. She’s fast asleep. Like a rock, like a rock. Such a strong wind... Quickly, quickly. Dora, you stupid girl! Do you want to sleep as well? Stop that wind, Snow Fairy! Do you want to save her as well? She belongs to me! Let me go inside the well! Stop the wind! Hear the verdict. Each of you is claiming the sheep is yours. We shall make this a short process. We’ll split the sheep in half, and each of you get one half. Yes, that’s for the best. No, please don’t. The sheep has to live. Let her have it, then. It’s yours. You proved you really love her. You see how smart our mayor is? And fair, too. No one can lie to him. Alžbeta hasn’t returned yet. Perhaps she lost her way. Let’s go and look for her. We’ll have to find her before nightfall. Alžbeta! We don’t know whether she’s even been here. She was. The cakes I gave her are here. And there’s the basket by the well. Perhaps she fell into the well. Take a look inside. That is strange. There was water in here and now there isn’t. Pull me up! There’s nothing here. Wake up, man! Wake up! What happened to Alžbeta? What happened to Alžbeta? I’m asking you that. She hasn’t come home from here. We were sitting here together and then... then I fell asleep. She left, right? Without clothes? What do you mean, without clothes? Don’t pretend you don’t know what I’m talking about. I have no clue. And what’s this? This belongs to Alžbeta! What have you done with her? Take him away! You’ve got it all wrong, mayor. Let me go and find her! Shut up, you bum. Children, go home. The others will keep on searching. Light some lanterns and search the forest. Take her, Snow Fairy, and protect her. But Death is stronger than love. My time will come! Alžbeta... Wake up... Am I dreaming or am I dead? You have slept long enough. I... I... In here you’ll have to work. Are you Death? You don’t really mean that, did you? Do I look like Death? I helped you. Why did you help me? Why did you save me? Actually, I wanted my snow blanket back. You are the Snow Fairy. You’re a smart girl. I’m glad you brought back my blanket. That fool Jakub would probably break all his bones flying with it. Where is he now? How is he? Stop questioning me! We’ve got work to do. Christmas is coming and we haven’t made any snow yet. He took my best snow blanket and the world was without snow. I’ll help you. I know everything. Jakub told me all about it. When he jumped from the chimney, he ripped the blanket apart. It took me a whole week to sew it back together. But you, Alžbeta, are a very well-behaved girl. You’ll stay here with me. We’ll have so much fun. I’d like that, but for how long? There’s someone waiting for me, down there. Oh, waiting, waiting... You’re both so selfish! I have to live here, all alone. I’m keeping you here forever. Come, let’s watch the snow falling. How beautiful the snow falls on earth. Like a big, white blanket. Can I see what Jakub is doing? As you wish. Still he’s nowhere to be seen. Not over there... Neither over there... Where could he be? That’s a prison. And I see him in there, behind bars. Locked up because of you. A few days before I could bring you something better to eat, my boy. Don’t worry, at least I won’t grow fat. I’m worried that they will hang you. A shame. I won’t die before I find her – dead or alive. How could you lose sight of her? I believe she’s still alive. I’m convinced that Dora and her mother are to blame. I’m powerless now. All evidence is against you. The law is the law. Have you really searched everywhere? She wasn’t inside the well, nor in the woods. We couldn’t find any trace of her, apart from her clothes we found next to you. Go on, eat some. Let me get out for only one night. I must find out what happened to her. I’d like to, but... Don’t worry, I will come back. If they find out... You know how the mayor is. They will hang me instead of you. Then what am I supposed to do? There is another way. How? How? On the day of your execution, if there’s any girl who wishes to marry you, they will grant you your freedom, and then you can search for Alžbeta. That is, if you don’t happen to like the other girl more, of course. I only want Alžbeta. Alžbeta! Then just wait in there for your other bride: Death! You can see what justice is like on earth. And your father is the judge. I could tell him the truth. If only you would let me go there. I won’t. Don’t you know any other way? Just think about it. Then let him marry the one who can save him from the gallows. He doesn’t need to be mine. I just want him to live. Well, all right, Alžbeta. Because of your good heart and your strong love, for giving him up just to save his life, I shall allow you to send him a message – the same kind he used to send you every time you were sad. You know how to make snow, and now you’ll learn how to make a rainbow. There they come! They’re taking the prisoner! God help you, boy. Jakub! Jakub, flee them! Flee! Thank you, Snow Fairy, for the rainbow. I see you haven’t forgotten about me. Though I rather would like to find my Alžbeta. But you never cared much about love. And therefore you are condemned to die on the gallows. But before that, we shall perform a tradition given us by our forefathers. This is your last chance to save your life. I ask you all, my people: Is there a girl amongst you who wishes to save his life by marrying him? If so, she’ll have to answer before the bell rings three times. Me, me! You, Dora? You? Stay put. This is our chance. - Yes, dear father, me, me. - That’s very noble of you. Our family, that has been affected the most by his crime, is showing mercy. I have to ask Jakub if he will take the offer. I ask you for the last time: will you take this virgin as your wife? - Never. - Are you crazy? Do it. Don’t cry, Dora. Don’t cry. - He doesn’t want me. - There, there... Wait, father. Yes, I will. I grant him mercy! You’re ours now. Ours... I know, my son-in-law... You should go and get ready, my boy. The wedding has almost started. And you play on! Everybody sing! The first guests. What kept you so long? A blizzard. Where are you off to? Josef, are you checking up on me? Where were do you think you’re going? Your clothes are upstairs. Upstairs. All right, I’m going. Give him the clothes, Michal! Here you go, groom. - And here are the boots. - Okay, okay... Everybody is so helpful, today. - Let me help you. - Stop it, I can dress myself. And I’m too shy. You’re protecting me like a treasure. Nobody will be able to steal me. Right? I want to try out my horse. All in due course, groom. After the wedding you can try out the horse and the bride, too. After the wedding. You could fall down. I will try the horse myself. - Bring me the horse! - The horse! - Am I pretty? - Like a painting of a saint. Even prettier. The horse is ready. Show us what you can, Dora! You’re staying here. I’ll help her. Hold on tight. Does it suit me, does it suit me? Magnificent, like a Hussar. But now we’ll make it more interesting. Help! Mommy, mommy! Hold that horse! - Stop him! - Let me through! Don’t let him get away! I’ll be back for my wedding. But with the woman of my choice! Mayor, Mayor! The groom is escaping! Boy, why are you running away? Stop! You fool! Shall we catch him? Let him go. Papa, papa, there’s a stranger on a white horse. - Stop. - Where is the director? He’s inside that tent, Jakub. Why did you lie to me, director? You said we would be happy on that hill. I didn’t lie to you. What do you mean? I lost everything! We all... shall dance... on your wedding day. What are you saying? Dance, Jakub. You old witch! Now I’ll never find out what he predicted. Ah, don’t hurt me and I’ll tell you everything! Where is Alžbeta? I’m not to blame. Dora and her mother poisoned you. Poisoned us? With the sugar. Blast it! I knew there was something strange about it. And then they both threw her into the well. But she wasn’t found in the well! So where is she? Where did she vanish to? I had to take her, just like this one. Are you saying Alžbeta isn’t alive anymore? No... she isn’t. Then my life no longer has any meaning. Tomorrow you can come and take me from the gallows. Finally you’ll be mine, Jakub. Yuck, you old hag! Just look at him! You would never get him, if he didn’t offer his life to you himself. You lied to him! Alžbeta... Wake up, Alžbeta. Open your eyes, my dear. - I have some bad news. - What is it, Snow Fairy? Jakub’s life is in danger. - Jakub is in danger? - He is. But... you said that Death was too scared of him, Ah, I said that, but that was then. The problem now is that Jakub offered his own life to Death. You are the only one who can save him. How do I get back to Earth? That will be difficult. Difficult. But if you truly love someone, you can do it. I am not scared, Snow Fairy. I’ll try it. I’ll make it spring for you. The trees are green. It will be a beautiful death. I’ll do it quickly, Jakub. Come. Where is Death? She should be here by now. I shouldn’t allow you to have your last wish – not only did you kill my daughter Alžbeta, you also betrayed my second daughter Dora and falsely accused my wife. Despite all of that, I’ll hear your last wish. What it is? Without Alžbeta my life has no meaning. My last wish is to die as soon as possible. That’s a strange wish. I won’t grant you that. If won’t grant me that and let me live, then I have a second wish – hang your wife and Dora. Insolent fool. Hang him at once! Jakub, oh Jakub... Do you have a mirror? Why? To see this lovely cravat. Right, commence the hanging! She has returned, she has returned. Alžbeta! Do something, do something! There is my Alžbeta. Alžbeta! You witch! She’s still alive! You lied to me! Help! Snow Fairy, he broke my scythe! Now I’m powerless! Jakub! My Alžbeta! Alžbeta... My father! Where were you? This is too much! He will pay for this, one day! And once again you’re scared of him, Death. But this time he will stay there forever. - We’ll take everything. - Everything, everything... Someone’s coming, someone’s coming! Carry on. - We won’t leave them anything. - We won’t, we won’t. - How could I be so blind? - Don’t worry about it, father. Look at this! What happened here? They took all the money. This is a disaster. How will I explain this to the people? Let’s get them! My horse! Let’s take the horses and go after them. Now we’ll catch the real culprits. So the Snow Fairy saved your life. Not just mine, but yours too. If she didn’t let me fly here on her snow blanket, you wouldn’t be alive either. I’ll wash it, and after our wedding we can sleep underneath it! - Sleep? - Yes! We’ll be flying with it! The Snow Fairy will create a wind and we will see the whole world! No trace. They completely vanished. I don’t know what to do now. Don’t worry. This mill will earn us back all the stolen money. And when will it be ready? It’s already finished. When will you test it? We’ve been waiting for your return. Hey, Snow Fairy! Listen! Send us some good wind! Look, the wicks are turning. Did you hear that? - The wind is good. - It is, it is. Here’s to you and your wonderful invention. It’s a good mill. It’s working really well, this mill. This will make so many loafs of bread. - This is not for bread. - For what then? Ask Jakub. - It’s for the wedding cakes. - The circus has arrived. For you, Alžbeta. Hold on to it, Dora! Now you have your peacocks again. Hold on to me, Dora! Don’t let me fall! Now we’re actually flying. Try to catch us now! Watch out, Dora! Look out for the wicks. The money! We’re losing the money! Well, mayor, there’s your money. Didn’t I tell you the mill would bring the money back? - Where will they fly to? - Wherever the Snow Fairy sends them. We’ve lost all the money. Why didn’t you hold on to it? How am I going to get married now? It’s all your fault, your fault! Without the money we don’t need your clothes either. That was my wedding dress! Now, what am I going to wear on my wedding? - You crazy, stupid mother! - You won’t get another dress, you goose! Dora, Dora! Wait for me! Dora! What’s this? What it is? It’s filthy water. What does she want? You. You! You, you... Jakub... In your bliss you’ve forgotten all about me, haven’t you? And I prepared this special wedding snow for you – snow from blossoms... wedding snow. It’s snowing blossoms. It’s snowing flowers! Hey, Snow Fairy, are you having snow in the summer? Finally you’ve learned something new! Thank you, Snow Fairy, for everything!
