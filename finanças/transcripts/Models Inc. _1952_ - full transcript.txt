I beg your pardon. Yes, ma'am? Is there a Mr. Cronan registered here? Just a minute, please. They're waiting for you, Mr. Stafford. Thank you. Room 433. The house phones are right over there. Thank you. 433, please. Hello. Oh, Rusty. How did you find me? Where are you? No. Nothing's the matter. Of course I won't see you. Suppose I call you there in about an hour. Bye. Yes, please. This is Mr. Cronan in 433. I'm checking out. Will you please send a bellboy right away for my luggage? Yes? The maid. Moving again? Look, Rusty. I can't help it. Try to understand. Why? My wife. She phoned last night. Unless I come home at once, she's going to sue me for divorce. I can't face a scandal. You mean you never told her you promised to marry me. I must have been crazy. Sure, crazy with love. That's what you said. You did all right. The point is I'm leaving. You can't bloom to town and promise me a job modeling your crummy lingerie and after a fast pitch, slough it off as a sweet dream! Look, Rusty... I don't let anybody run out on me. I haven't anything more to give you. Get it, or she will. This is blackmail. Right. Don't forget I gave you the best month of my life. You're no good, Rusty. A matter of opinion. Well? That's all I have. It was an anniversary present. That's sweet of you, Ed. From you to me. How am I going to explain that to my wife? You lost it. Besides... cat's eyes are hard luck for some people. How does it make you feel, Rusty? Cheap. But that's how it is. Everything out, sir? Everything. One more turn and then take off the capes. Hey, what's going on in there, honey? Fashion show rehearsal. Is he the boss? Yes, John Stafford. Don't get any ideas, honey. Peggy, who is that girl? I never saw her before. Excuse me. Ow! Oh, I'm so terribly sorry. What happened? Ah, I don't know, exactly. Get me a chair. There. How'd it happen? The door. My foot. Maybe out to get the hotel doctor. Oh, well, that won't be necessary. I'll be all right in a moment. As you wish. All right, girls. Start again. Say. It's a beauty. Just salvage. Any beefs? He grunted once or twice, but I explained to him the high cost of leaving. You know why I like you, Rusty? Why? You talk like a man. Well, as long as I don't look like one. I don't worry about you. You got cash? Eh, $200... It depends on how you look at it. For you, fair. For me, great. Now you can pay your tab. $68. The drink's on the house. Next time around. Look, kiddo. Don't con me. I'm not. I'm investing in a big deal. Not with my $68. I'm parlaying this $200 into $2 million. You ever hear of John Stafford? John Stafford. Take it from me... he... Try any paper any day. The model guy? Eh, I'll say he..., but who with? You sure you haven't been drinking somewhere beside here? Wanna bet? Bet what? The ring against the tabs. I bring him in here. You do that, I'll eat them tabs. OK. Start developing an appetite. In the meantime, I'll hold the stakes. May I help you, miss? Yes. I'm interested in enrolling in the school. Fill out this application and have a seat, please. Thank you. Well, um, you two ladies come with me, please. Congratulations, ladies. Now, it's not going to be as easy as you might think. As a matter of fact, it'll take a lot of hard work... exercise, study, long hours. We may want to make you over from head to foot. So be prepared for anything. At any rate, you're part of the family now, so good luck. If you'll just follow Miss Howard, she'll get you started. This way, girls. Oh, Miss, uh, Faraday? Yes, Mr. Stafford? One moment, please. I've been, uh, studying your application form... interesting background. It depends upon how you look at it, Mr. Stafford. When did you decide to become a model? Yesterday. Well, run along. I think the most important point to be remembered in a good looks program is how to stand... that is, good posture. Now, several important points to be remembered are these, and I think you guys would be wise to make note of them. The first one is chest high at all times. One, two, three, four. One, two, three four. Inhale. Exhale. Inhale. Exhale. Inhale. Exhale. Inhale. Exhale. Inhale. Exhale. Would you step down, please? Miss Faraday, could you step on the platform, please? Very nice. Miss McGuiness? Would you care to step up on the platform? What's the matter. You getting too classy for the bar? Stop... My, well, as soon as you pay me what you owe me, every week it's getting bigger. The trouble with you Louie... you've got no imagination. Oh, I get that line from every panhandler just before the touch. You'll get your dough plus a fancy interest. I don't want it fancy. I'll settle for 130, plain. You're holding the ring, aren't you? Oh, big deal. For 130 smackers, I'd buy three like it. Maybe four. Well, I can't rush this. I need time. ...you do. I've been saving it for you. So he's interested in charity. So what? So he's also interested in her. I know. I've been following him in the paper, like... watches his stock. I've been watching him too. Yes? Miss Faraday to see Mr. Stafford. Tell her I'll be right out. She says it's important. She wants to see Mr. Stafford personally. Send her in. Smart girl, that one. Very. It's all right, Miss Faraday. You're on. Oh, sit down, please. I'd rather stand for what I have to say. You sit down, please. Wow. It sounds serious. It is, Mr. Stafford. I skipped my lunch waiting to see you. Please. Mr. Stafford, you're a man who goes in for a lot of charity. Now, don't tell me you're going to sell me a raffle ticket. Kind of, only I'm the charity. It's your form letter. Pay up my tuition or I'm dropped, as of tonight. Well, now you've had a week to take care of this. Why the last minute? I hoped I'd get the money, but I didn't. Nevermind, Mr. Stafford. Forget it. Oh. Before I go, I want you to know that being here was the one decent thing that's happened to me. Oh, Miss Faraday. Yes? Your studying here means that much to you? If you only knew how much. All right. I'll buy that raffle ticket. And lunch. Oh, Mr. Stafford. You've done enough already. Not at all. It's all part of the scholarship. I was just thinking how much you've changed. Thanks. No, I mean what the school has done for you... hair and makeup, everything. It must be a satisfaction in knowing that you can press a button and prove almost any woman that comes along. Well don't most men think they can do the same thing? Thinking and doing are two different things. With you, it's a profession. Well, I like my work. And dislike women. I don't follow. Well, anyone who makes a career out of changing women can't have a very good opinion of them in the first place. Interesting observation. Is that why you never go out with any of your models? Well, I didn't think it was a matter of public gossip. Well, it is. Well then maybe I better do something about it. Oh, my compliments to the maestro. And tell him to keep playing. Anything special, sir? No. I'll leave that up to you. Yes, sir. And now stand by for the 11 o'clock news round up. AM or PM? Who cares? Say, haven't we skipped a meal or two? Have we? I hadn't noticed. Well, we've got to eat some time. Come on. I know just the place. All right. How did you get in here? I was the landlady's type. Get out. Aren't you going to say hello? Hello. Now goodbye. After all I've done for you. You've done for me! Get out. I like it here. Look, Chisler. I'm doing all right now without you. So Louie told me... clothes, Jaguar, plenty of money. He's also good to me. That's more than you ever were Well, I'm good for you, Rusty. All you ever did was to keep me running... running from suckers who squealed, running from cops. Always running. If I never see you again it'll suit me fine. But it was all right for me to take the rap for you? For me? Who talked me into that deal anyway? Two years... two long years out of my life. If anybody should be mad, Rusty, it's me, not you. But I'm willing to let bygones be bygones. Stay away from me. Stay away. It's been a long time, Rusty... a long time. Oh, Lennie. Why'd you have to come back now? ...now I've served a whole five years... No, Lennie, no. Only everything was going so good. It'll be better. Lennie's back. If you think you're upsetting this gravy train, you're out of your mind. I work too hard for it. You've got me all wrong. Live and let live... that's my motto. I know you better. A place like this must have cost quite a few grand to put together. You can't talk me into another one of your two-bit swindles. You haven't heard it yet. If I've heard one, I've heard them all. OK, if that's the way you want it. OK. Who do you think you're kidding, you phony? And who do you think you're kidding? Rusty, this is the perfect set up... the one we've always dreamed of. I don't get it. Stafford has models, hasn't he? So? So what's wrong with putting someone to work? He can't object to that. You're crazy. He has... Prose, but not for the students. That's where I come in. What's wrong with them picking up a little dough? Stafford's no fool. He'd see through you in a minute. Right. But not through you. Of course I'll need a place to operate from... something with style. Well, that takes money. Sure. I figure $1,114, to be exact. You dirty crook. I might have known you never change. Nothing ever changes. Hello? Oh, hello, darling. Sure. I got home safely. No. As a matter of fact, I wasn't thinking about you. No? I've been thinking about business. Business? That sounds serious. I've just had the most terrific idea. I'll tell you about it tomorrow for your birthday. Sure. I knew. Well, I'm very flattered. I can't wait until tomorrow. Sleep tight, dear. Goodbye, darling. I could kill you. You'd miss me. All right. Fine. That's good now. OK, kids. Here you are. Thanks, Peggy. What do you think? God... She'll like it. Oh, you'll find a little something from me in the third drawer, left side. You know, I'm old fashioned. I believe in giving you a present on your birthday. Beautiful. I'm glad you like it. Like it, I love it! Well... I've arranged a party at the club. This is one night I'd hoped to have you to myself. Well, it's just a small party, dear... a few close friends. I thought we could stay here. Well, what about dinner? Turn around. Close your eyes. Now. What... I cooked it myself. Well, I'm flattered. See what's on your plate. Go on. Rusty, it's beautiful. I'm glad you like it. You shouldn't have done this, Rusty. It must have cost a lot of money. It belonged to my father. It's been our family for years. I've been saving it for the right man. You've made me very happy. That's the point. Well, what about that business arrangement you spoke of on the phone? Oh, that can wait. First things first. From now on, I want every model on the Kennedy job approved by me. The whole account's fouled up. That was the day we couldn't reach you, remember? Oh. And speaking of Ms. Faraday, did you authorize her to get a list of all our student models? A list? What list? Names, addresses, phone numbers. Oh, a list. Yes. Yes, I did. It's part of some social work she's doing. Mmm. That I'd like to see. Look, Peggy. Why don't you give her a break? All you've done ever since she came here is try to find fault with her. I'm not here to discuss Ms. Faraday with you, Mr. Stafford. I just wondered what she'd want with that list. ...now, girls. Make sure your phone numbers are on them. Thank you. I'll, uh, contact you later on in the week for individual interviews for advanced work. Thank you, Mr. Stone. Thank you. I hope you call us soon. You'll be hearing from me. Thank you. Yes? Is this the place where you sign up for the, uh, the camera class? That's on Wednesdays. Freddie said it was tonight. Well, Freddie's wrong. Come back then. I'll... I'll get to snap pictures of... of real Stafford models, then? Sure. All you want. What's that? This? Well, this is my camera. Where's the lens? Lens. I need a lens? Fred didn't tell me I... Nevermind. We'll rent you one. See you Wednesday. Freddie. Freddie! Look, stupid. Can't I depend upon you to do anything right? What'd I do? The live model class meets on Wednesday. Now, you got that? Check. How about the hackies and the bellboys? You line any yet? My boys are all set. And they've got a full list of all our services. Hi boys. Hi Rusty. Hi. Well, it looks like I've got you all set up here. Don't take all of the credit. Remember, it was my meal, the one I cooked for Stafford, that cinched it. The things they teach you at San Quentin. Who asked you? Take over. And remember, this is a respectable place of business. OK. Be right back. Oh! What a nice surprise, darling. I thought we had a date tonight. Did we? Darling, I'm terribly sorry. It must have slipped my mind. How's the new car running? Wonderfully. But wouldn't you know, just because I like driving it so much, I couldn't tonight. Why not? It's my wrist. I hurt it. Who drove you home? Oh, John. You're jealous. Mr. Stone and I were just working on our little project. It must be very important to keep you there until midnight. Why, I thought you approved. Otherwise I wouldn't have started it. You don't mind, do you? I'd mind less if you'd send him away. Oh, he's still waiting... some names I promised to get for him. Oh, here they are. I'll be right back. Amateurs, Studio B... registration, $5. Professionals, Studio A... registration $10. And $2 and $3 an hours. What will it be, gentlemen? That's pretty steep. For the models, gentlement? The models? What will it be? Amateur. Uh, you'll want a camera, won't you? Oh, yeah. Yeah. Sure thing. Sure. Rental is $2. Follow me. All right, gentlemen. Here we have the four seasons, and over here, the famous women of history. Take your pick. It's coming along fine. Eh. $7 and $12 a head, not bad. And the day is young. My wife thinks I'm in San Diego. Say, Mr. Stone, on winter, would you use a 3.5 lens stop at 1/100th of a second shutter speed? Not me. Right through the red door. What can I do for you? Amateur or professional? I'm John Stafford. Lennie. Lennie! Lennie! I'll take care of it. What do you want? Oh, uh, Mr. Stafford? Yes. You're Mr. Stone, I take it. Fred, I've told you before... this is a place of business. You'll have to stop shouting. I'm sorry, sir. I've, uh, been meaning to call you, Mr. Stafford, to thank you for being so decent about everything. - You can thank Ms. Faraday. - I know. And not only that... she's been giving up all her spare time helping us get started here. Well, that's nice of her. I wish you could hear some of things she says about you, sir. She says you're a prince if ever there was one, and I certainly agree. Now, where were your studios before this, Mr. Stone? Well, you see, uh... the last place I, uh... Why, darling. I was just on my way over to your office. I see you two have met. Yes. We were just getting acquainted. You're getting along fine, Mr. Stone. Thanks to you, Ms. Faraday. Come on, darling. I'm starved. A pleasure meeting you, Mr. Stafford. All mine. Goodbye. You're angry about something, John. This man Stone. You known him long? A few years. I needed help once and he did me a favor. That's why I want to help him now. Well, I want to believe you, Rusty, but... John, you don't need to be jealous. You know that. I don't know what to think, Rusty. All the thinking I do leads to you, anyway. I've become suspicious, distrusting. Oh, you needn't be. I love you, Rusty. I want to marry you. Tomorrow, if you'd like. Are you sure, John? Yes. But I want you to be sure, Rusty. I'll be waiting for your call the first thing in the morning. All right. Let's have it. Have what? The money you held out. Me? The rest of it. Come on. I can't make a living. Not bad for a night's work. Half of it's yours. Keep it. What's the matter? Couldn't handle Stafford? He wants me to marry him. Just like that. And this is only chicken feet compared to what he's got. Maybe. I don't know. The point is he wants to marry me. Well you've got what you want. And you've got what you want. Is that it? Oh, stop hounding me, Lennie. Give me a break. How long do you think it's going to last? I don't know. Well, I'll tell you. Just long enough for you to start thinking about me. We're no good for each other, Lennie. We're no good period. We're a team. We come two in a package... a couple of first class heels that were made for each other. He wants to marry me. So do I. Use your head, Rusty. All you wanted out of Stafford was money, and you've got that now. We've both got it, and we're set up to make a lot more. Just you and me, baby. Tell me I'm wrong. Oh, I don't know, Lennie. I don't know. I sent the Whitney account executive away. I told him you had a headache. Anything I can do for your headache? You can go home, Peggy. Miss Faraday didn't attend classes today. Any connection? Yes. Just as well. Know it all, don't you? Well, here's something you didn't know. I asked her to marry me, but she's not interested. That's right. Our little student can have me... the whole works... and that includes you, Miss Howard. Only she's not buying. Save it. Yeah? I want to see Rusty. Well, she doesn't want to see you. John. You we're supposed to call me. Why didn't you, Rusty? Haven't you made up your mind yet? What do you think? I meant what I said last night... for better or worse. And I know what he must have meant to you, but it doesn't matter. Now, you know I'm right. Come on. Let's get your things. Leave him alone, you maniac! Leave him alone. You want to go back to prison? Get out of here quick. I'll try and save your neck. Here. Oh, that crazy fool. Are you all right? What are you going to do? Call the police. Please don't. Does he mean that much to you? No. It's just what I needed to make up my mind. Do You still want me? We'll go to Mexico tonight. You are as one now. You may kiss her. Thank you. And for luck, you may keep this. Thank you. Gracias. Hey, you're supposed to be happy. I am. All girls cry at their wedding, haven't you heard? Yes, I've heard. Look. Let's make a bargain. We'll forget everything that's happened up until now. The road ahead is clear, Rusty. The road ahead. All right, John. Let's go. Whatever you say. Well, then it's a deal. Right. We'll call it the, uh, Bathing Suit Buyers Convention. Yeah. Big Jim will like that. There's one more little item. Yeah, what's that? The money. $5,000, right? Well, here's $2,000 in advance. Here. And just make sure they're all Stafford models. Nothing but the best. See you at the party. Yeah. I'll be there. I like that... Bathing Suit Buyers. Ha. That's a good one. Hello? Mexico City calling? Uh, who? Ah, yeah. How's it going? No fooling. I knew you could do it, Rusty. Oh, good. That's... that's great. What? Rusty? Where are ya? I've been looking for you for two days. You married him? Yes, Lennie. I promised to love, honor, and obey til death do us part. I meant every word of it. Where are you? Where you can't get at me to mix me up. You're crazy. Not anymore. I'm through running, Lennie. You're on your own from now on. Look, Rusty. No. I'm giving you a better break than you ever gave me. You've got two weeks until we get back. That's long enough for you to pick up some cash and get out of town. Because after that, you're out of business, so goodbye. Wait a minute, Rusty. Don't hang up. Two weeks, Lennie. Goodbye. Rustie! She hang up? Well, we said... had a mind of her own. We were cut off. I'm leaving. You didn't tell me it was going to be this kind of a party. You've been paid for six hours. Your time's not up yet. And who's going to pay for this dress? Get into a bathing suit. It'll be less wear and tear. How about a dance? Don't... Oh, come on. That's old fashioned laws. Just... Please don't! Fill her up, Mack. I got 19 inside already. How's about one on the outside, huh? Now we start all over. Take it easy over there, you guys. Watch the old blood pressure. Everything all right, Jim? Ah, it couldn't be better if I'd arranged it myself... especially the entertainment. Glad to hear it. Um, there's a little matter of, uh, $3,000 due. ...any time to get my old friend Marney over there a... You know, that's all Marney thought about while he was up in the pen. I was going to give him a real old-time party when he got out. Well, I guess I kept my word. Glad to be of service. Having a good time, Marney? Glad to hear it. You know any time when my... gets out, you guys get the business. Thanks. Well, I'm certainly glad you are back. Congratulations, Mrs. Stafford. Thank you. Uh, this is Sergeant Mooney of the Detective Bureau. He wanted some information on that girl. Mmm. A terrible accident. Well, these things happen. Thanks again for your help, Ms. Howard. What was that girl doing up there? Well, as far as I know, she was one of a group sent by your agency to model bathing suits. I explained to the Sergeant that the girls were sent by a sub agency of ours operated by Mr. Stone. Yes. I remember her... a very young girl. When did this happen? A little after 10 last night. She'd been drinking. Well, I guess that's about all for the present. Oh, uh, how long has Mr. Stone been working for you, Mr. Stafford? How long would you say, Rusty? Oh, about three months, maybe. I see. Thanks. I'll get in touch with you if there's anything else. Do you mind, Peggy? Not at all. I know what you're thinking. Then why don't you start lying your way out of it? I'm all out of lies. Why didn't you tell me the kind of racket he was carrying on behind my name? I tried to, but I couldn't. Why not? Because I was fool enough to think that he'd leave me alone if he got enough money. You've got to believe me. I don't know what to believe anymore. I thought we said we were through with the past. The girl who went out that window was through with hers, too. It's not fair to blame me for that. Isn't it? You knew all along what he's been doing. You've never really been honest with me. All right. If that's the way it must be. Goodbye. I think I found something. Two to 10 for blackmail, just starting parole. Where does he come off in a photo shop? He's supposed to be working in a garage. Where are you going? I think I'll have my picture taken. John. Leaving town? Look, you. I'm in no mood for cat and mouse. If you've got anything to say, say it and get out. You've got your mind made up, huh? Moving too fast for your quarters or maybe just going home to mother? What difference does it make? Well, I wouldn't know whether to give you a wedding present or my sympathy. It gets around fast, doesn't it? Well, how do you like that? I was just guessing, but it turns out I'm right. Stafford's giving you the gate, huh? All right. You've had your laugh for the day. Now beat it. And leave you here alone, crying the blows? At a time like this, a girl needs a friend. Haven't you done enough? Leave me alone, can't you? No. One thing about me, Rusty... I don't care kid myself. But you never learn. Keep away from me. Make me. The police will. Oh. My peace offering. I wanted them to tell you that I was willing to forget everything. How stupid can one man be? What'd you expect? Don't, Lennie. I wish things were different, but they're not. Why don't you be smart? Go on home. Forget it. It wouldn't have worked out anyway. I guess not. The pity of it is I thought it would. Spoken like a gentleman, Mr. Stafford. Now I guess it's time to put out the cat... you know, tie up all the loose ends. After all, the lady has to live. Yes, I see. I don't want his money. No? What was it you liked about him? Let's face facts. See, Mr. Stafford, without me, she'd go hungry. Leave it the way it is, Lennie. You've got your husband all wrong. He wants to help you. What's it worth to you, Mr. Stafford? No scandal. She just fades right out of your life. Everything has its price, hasn't it? $10,000 and she files for a Mexican divorce in the morning. That's where you said goodbye to a past. Keep talking and the price goes up. $10,000. She could have had that many times over. You know that, Rusty, don't you? The price just went up another 5. He said 10. Let it go at that. No, no. 15. It's still a bargain. Here. Paid in full. Now if you'll just phone the bank and tell them to expect Mrs. Stafford. I never could get over how just a little piece of paper could carry so much weight. Hello. This is John Stafford. May I speak to Mr. Reynolds, please? Get your things on, Rusty. We're going shopping for money. Is that you, Joe? Fine. Look, my... my wife's coming over to cash a rather large check. Would you take care of her for me, please? Thank you. You know how it is with banks. Hate to take chances. Yes. Yes, I know. Oh, you'll probably want this. It's an old family heirloom. It goes with the winner. Thanks, Mr. Stafford. I'll consider it a wedding present. Goodbye, Rusty. I hope you'll be very happy. It's too late for that now. You should have turned them on when he was here. Why did you do it, Lennie? For this. Somebody's got to worry about you. About me or what's in it for you? For both of us. After all, you're still his wife. That gives you some rights. You talk of rights. What's the matter, Rusty? Am I beginning to remind you of your father? Maybe it's beginning to remind me I once had a conscience. You never were too good in the home stretch, Rusty... where it counts. Even when we were kids. That's right, Lennie. Neither of us has changed very much. Oh, a better suit or a dress, maybe. But in here, where it really counts, we're still the same kids looking for shortcuts to the rainbow. We haven't got time for speeches. Get your things. Sure. No time for anything but running. I'm tired of running to noplace. What's in the cards for us, Lennie? I don't know. But whatever it is, it's for both of us. Come on. How do you do, Mrs. Stafford? Nice to see you again. I want to ask you a few questions, Mr. Stone. Why, sure. What's it all about? A couple things. That school you operate in. The parole officer said... Lennie! Come on. I had to do it. What'd you want me to do, go back to San Quentin? All right, Lennie. What now? Bank. No, Lennie. No. We've got to take the chance. We need money... lots of it. Walk around the block. I'm frightened, Lennie. It's our only out, baby. Oh, Mrs. Stafford? Yes. I'll be with you in just a moment. Now. If you'll sign right here. Uh, sign? Your name. Ah. My name. Oh, excuse me. There we are. Amalia. Posbischield. That's right. And now here. Here? If you please. Amalia Posbischield. And now I sign. I come back later. That's right. On Tuesday. Ah. Thursday. No, no, no, no. Tuesday... Monday, Tuesday. Tuesday. That's right. Goodbye, Mrs. Posbischield. Goodbye, sir. Mrs. Stafford, please. I hope you had a pleasant trip, Mrs. Stafford. Oh, yes. Oh. Would you endorse this, please? You know, I've always wanted to go to Mexico. I might do it Sunday, too... take the wife along, of course. Thank you. Now, how do you want this, Mrs. Stafford? Oh, 50s or 100s... anything at all. Excuse me, please. Pardon me, Mrs. Stafford. Mr. Reynolds tells me you're, uh, cleaning us out. I best be seeing you to your car. I'll be all right. No trouble at all... all part of the service, ma'am. No thank you. It won't be necessary. As you wish. Here we are. Now, let's see if we can find an envelope. Some day I'm going to clean this desk out. Yeah. Here we are. Yes? Yes. Yes, of course. All right. Goodbye. There you are, Mrs. Stafford. Thank you very much. Not at all. Goodbye. Bye. Put some into your purse. That's it! ADK to Controller One. The Jaguar automobile described from the attack on Officer Moody is going east on Third Street. We'll report. Come on. Trouble? I need a gun. Now look, Lennie. I'll pay you. Don't mix me up in nothing. You get it. Don't drag me into this. Get out. Rusty! Rusty. I can't run anymore. I'm too tired. Rusty! Rusty. Now, it's not going to be as easy as you might think. As a matter of fact, it will take a lot of hard work, exercise, study, long hours. We may want to make you over from head to foot. So be prepared for anything. At any rate, you are part of the family now, so good luck. Now, if you'll follow Ms. Howard, she'll get you started. This way, girls. They're waiting for you, miss. If my problems weren't solved, I had to stay away from New York for all time. But... Roberts was listed as dead and had to stay dead. But I could never go back to Hollywood. Someone might recognize me as Haskel. Then to there was Sue. I could never go to her with a thing like this hanging over my head. All I could do was pray she'd be happy. I was in Bakersfield before I read that... body was discovered. And if the police were looking for Haskel in connection with his wife's murder, isn't that a laugh? Haskel got me into this mess and Haskel was getting me out of it. The police were searching for a dead man. I keep trying to forget what happened and wonder what my life might have been if that car of Haskel's hadn't stopped. But one thing I don't have to wonder about... I know someday a car will stop to pick me up that I never thumbed. Yes. Fate or some mysterious force can put the finger on you or me for no good reason at all.
