In my dream, I saw my mother. Lashes Hair It was my mother. Her hair. Her walk. Even her shadow. Mother? But I've never seen my mother's face before. They said my mother's eyelashes were long. That's why my sisters' eyelashes were long, too. I resemble my father. The only person who remembers my mother's face is my father. Mother. They said my mother had a mental illness. My eldest sister died in a car accident. Could it be my mother's fault? My mother and father divorced, and I don't know what my mother looks like. The only person who knows my mother's face is my father. My daughter. I thought my daughter resembled my wife. But my father said she looked like my mother. Whether I like it or not, I'm taking after my father. In my dream...

From Kim Hyun-seung's poem, Tears A Drop of Clear Salty Liquid Tears just came out. Tears just came out? Yeah, tears came out, I'm telling you. That's impossible. It's because of a guy, huh? I don't even have a boyfriend. - Then how? - I don't know. Then did dust get into your eyes? (Bak Mee-sun,18, student) Everyone and I was shocked cause it was a first. I think they said they were shocked, too. (Yoon Hyae-mi, 18, classmate) Some girls imitated her to get the teacher's attention. Well, since she seems different from us. Some girls said she's a crazy bitch. So it doesn't mean that I'm weak or very lonely. And it's not like I cry at the movies either. I'm just a normal guy. Somebody bothering you? No. Then is it your test results? No. Then why did you cry? (Lee Sung-min, 37, School Counselor) Wouldn't it be because of stress? But stress doesn't just come out of nowhere. There's no cure at the moment. Have to be stronger. No. Then why did you cry? Why are the lessons so expensive? Do I have to send him this month? Tell me so I can understand. He'll come home early. Because of his fit this morning. - Something wrong at home? - No. So why the hell did you cry? At first, I thought people would see, so I wore sunglasses. I didn't know when it would stop, but I couldn't just wear it all the time. So people I knew eventually found out. Others were more worried and agitated than I was. (Nam Hyun-woo, 62, security guard) They said medicine would help, but I guess it didn't. - Have a nice day. - You too. They said, how could we send that crying girl outside? That's how they grieved their misfortune. Something's wrong at school? If so, her homeroom teacher Would've said something. So what's wrong with her? So what's wrong with her? Go to the school tomorrow. What about the hospital? What about the hospital? Then go to the hospital first, okay? Go to the hospital, okay? It's the discharge in your tear ducts. Medicine will make it better. I hate it when people treat me as a strange person. Thank goodness the hospital cared for me a lot. I always took the medicine they gave me. It's probably in the records. (Bak Mee-gyung, 35, School Nurse) Where was it? Here it is. She only came twice. She just laid here and left. The other time she brought her medicine, took it, laid down, and left. (Yeo Mee-jung, 33, apartment resident) I'm not too sure. - Did you hear about her? - About who? - A girl that keeps crying. - Don't know her. Well, I'm not too sure. Strange, I would've heard it. No, I don't know her. But... The tears still came out. It's really strange. This high school girl saw me, and she cried. I rode on the subway, and the tears came out again. But the girl across from me looked at me and tears came down. Without a doubt, she was looking at me. I probably can't sleep today. I feel strange. I took the medicine for a few days, but the tears still came. So I hated to ride on the subway. Even if I think about all the eyes looking at me, it's very horrifying. But there was a weird occurence. Tears fell again, and a man across from me was looking at me, and he started to cry. Without a doubt, he cried because of looking at me. All of what I am has neither crack, scratch nor speck.

I'm not on my period, but weird puss keeps coming out. Why does it keep happening? Go to the hospital. They said nothing's wrong. Because it's hot, that's why. Don't you think so? So-mee.

When they had weddings long ago, they set the date based on the lunar calendar, so my mother didn't know her wedding anniversary. What my mother remembers is that on her wedding day even though it was a hot summer, there was a very cool breeze. Afterwards, that was how I was born. You can put your bag in front of the seat.
