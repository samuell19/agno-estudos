(Multicom jingle) (engine rumbling) (brakes squealing) (dramatic music) - I am the fugitive. Leave your money. - Go. (punches and kicks thudding) (yelling) - Now, hold it! (gun firing) - Jiang Wu-Ke, we've got you at last then. (yelling) (blows thudding) Now, get him! - Yes! - Okay! (dramatic music) (blows thudding) (officers groaning) (gun firing) (dramatic music) (gun firing) (dramatic music) (wind whistling) (yelling) (blows thudding) (dramatic music) - You done well. - Thank you for waiting. Xiao Lan, let's take a stroll. (soft music) Xiao Lan, I've got a bit of good news to tell you. - What kind of news? - Have a guess. - Please tell me now. - Hey. My brothers agreed to our marriage. - Really? - Ah, you happy then? (dramatic music) (laughing) (man yelling) It's Yaba. (man grunting) Yaba? Are you sure Chen San has come back? (man grunting) Xiao Lan, maybe something's going on? We'd better go back. Come on. - I am sure you thought me mad, you stupid fools, huh. (man laughing) I tell you each dog will have his day. Heh, you men push me out of the village, heh. Told me go, Joe. This Joe went off to Japan, heh. They took this silly fool, me, Chen San, and now I've come back to show you what I picked up there and Hoh Sau-san what it's called. Heh, I will help you to know what I learned there in a moment. - [Men] Hmm? - Heh. Heh. (laughs) Heh. Heh. Hey! Heh, heh, heh. Heh, this is something special, a mix of killing blow judo and karate. Could say that it's unbeatable but now you men too are favored. The Japanese want to come here to this place and set up a gym now and then you can learn too. - Huh? We'll have Japs here? - Don't knock it. I've been sent ahead as their first guy out here. I've been sent here to try and buy some dragon herb for their great leader and I can pay well. (dramatic music) - Nothing doing! We're the only villages growing the dragon herb. If the Japanese buy it all and the plague comes to China, what will we do? - God Almighty. What's the difference how you sell it? The Japanese, I am sure, will pay well and make the village fortunate, heh-heh. - You speak up for them in this way and then lead them here? What sort of rat are you? (blows thudding) (men yelling) - You better not think Yu Yang has taught you to fight. Just hold on. Right, in a minute you will know that I am Chen San. (men yelling) (blows thudding) (yelling) - [Man] Yu Yang's coming! - Chen San, you dare come here? Two years back, you were driven from this place. You are here again, what have you come for? - (blows thudding) (laughs) - Young master, you're still as fast as ever, as ever. Powerful, powerful. - Chen San, I'm telling you, could be you're up to your old tricks again. Be good or I'll flatten you. - Sure, sure, sure, be good, be good. (laughs) (dramatic music) - Come on. - Mother, could be that he'll be the one to go. The Japs are coming. They will show you. (dramatic music) - Uh, brother. I'm a traveler. I'd like to spend the night here. Would you know of a place that could put me up, just for the night? Leave tomorrow. - Hm, hm, hm. Hm. (dramatic music) (blows thudding) (laughs) - Hey, Xiao Lan? - Oh, she's on her way back home. - Ah, haven't seen her for some time. - Now, tell me, when did you get here? - I just got here. I must say you've really improved a lot. - Ah, compared with you I feel useless. Hey, each year you come home in October. Why so early now? - The plague's the thing that brought me. The north is suffering badly. I came back here purposely at their request. Dragon herb is what they need now. - Oh, we'll pack some right away. Say how much you want. - That's terrific. We knew we could rely on you. - You must be sure to return quickly. - Ah, brother. - Yu Yang, they told me just a while ago that bad guy Chen San is back here. - I know he is, we've already had some words. - Seems he left here about two years ago now. He's been in Japan ever since. - Who's come back, someone we know? - He's a guy we drove out years ago. He was such a villain and now he's here again. - Oh? - Tell, me how are things developing? You're in government, you should know what's going on. - The Japanese are hiding out now. They have robbed and plundered, taken what they want, every time, but they flunked the (speaking in foreign language) Fortunately. There we laid in wait and got two of the leaders. We've now heard there are plans to try and save these Japanese. We will not be forced to let them go. I wonder if there's a link here somewhere. - With the Japanese here in this town, perhaps it's part of their plot to take over? - Could be. - No, wait a minute. They must want something. Now, what could they want round here? People barely make a living. I wonder what they want. - [All] Hmm. - Hey, I know what they want! - [All] Dragon herb! - Right, the Japanese know all about the plague and know too we grow the only herb to cure it. They'll want to have it and they do not mind how, by force if they have to. By withholding the herb, they'll barter for the release of their men. They're ruthless and they could come at any time. - Now what can we do? - Let's go and get Chen San. - Sure! - Teacher! They're here the Japanese! (dramatic music) - Master, you've come so early. I had thought you had asked me to come here first and you come the following week. - We just appeared. We don't explain our plans to you because it's our little surprise. - Sure, sure, of course it is, of course it is. Sir, now which gymnasium would you like to visit, huh? - [Kuan Tai] Anyone will do now. - Oh, we'll go right to Sen Yang's place. (dramatic music) (men yelling) - [Sen Yang] No, no, you must use more force. - Heh. - Okay. - Hey, you my friend, remember me, then? - Of course, why'd you come back? - Heh, I brought some friends here, they're Japanese. They say they want to buy some of your famous dragon herb. They also expressed keen interest in opening a gym here. - Chen San, have you gone out of your mind? You're just as bad as the men you're messing with. Now, just get out and don't come back. Go! - Oh? - Go on! - Huh? There's no need to talk like that now. You're just being stupid. We could all profit well if we just did a deal. (yelling) (blows thudding) (laughing) - Hey, why don't we go down to Yu's House? (dramatic music) Think now, if we kill his brothers, things will slot in place like a jigsaw. They'll have to, we'll have the herb. (dramatic music) - [Kuan Tai] Are you Mr Yu Chang? - You're the Japanese. - [Kuan Tai] Now, listen, I can help you, that is if you do a deal with me. - What sort of deal? - [Kuan Tai] With that herb. - I can't. - [Kuan Tai] But I can give you a good price. - I'm sorry. I cannot sell to you. It's a firm rule that we have. (laughs) - You don't understand. You can make lots of dough. So, why not do yourself a favor? - You must know the truth, so be it. If we were dying of hunger, we would not sell to you. - Yu Chin, why don't you see that this could be good for you? Now, listen here, it seems I must spell it out for you. The man who's just been speaking to you is the (speaking in foreign language) able to buy you all a hundred times over. Heh. Here is most famous of all teachers Tio To. He's very tough. Heh, here is teacher Hazkowa. Heh, also one of the best in all of Japan, last but not the least, this is teacher Jo. - Ah, then tell me the breed of snake you are. - Heh, what's that? You dare to sneer at me? (yelling) - [Man] I'll take him! (blows thudding) (yelling) - [Kuan Tai] Stop now. You Chinese have an old saying that courtesy is everything. I like that. There is nothing I like better than to do business with courtesy, but you'd better know I also intend to buy your gymnasium. - Ha, you'll not get it. Scram! (dramatic music) (laughing) - Go ahead, hang it. - [Man] Yeah. (men chattering) - [Chen San] Heh, let's go. (grunting) - To my best village prosper. I'm willing to buy the dragon herb for the highest price and to improve your fighting spirit, I intend to run a gymnasium here. Those of you who think they can match my men can come and try. You'll start tomorrow. This is a chance for all. - Okagawa. (dramatic music) - Heh, I sure don't get you. I must be told why, just tell me why we don't get them because that will solve all our problems then. Rub out the ewes and the herbs ours, you know. Maybe you'll explain your reasons to me, doing things this way. (laughs) - [Kuan Tai] You think that I enjoy playing around like this? - No, not at all. Even if we had the herb, it would be no use. The boat's not here. Five days more and the tide will be right again. The herb will be growing nicely then. We'll replace it with fresh opium. (laughs) Chen San, now then are you willing to fight the duel? - Eh? No one needs me there. You guys can handle the Yu brothers, well, better include me out. - [Kuan Tai] Hmm. Now that's what I call real cowardly. Sad, I would have really liked to have seen another Chinese fighting you. (laughing) - It seems that someone wants to challenge us. The Japanese want to defeat us here. I know what they'll gain by that, so we can't take it lightly. - Hmm, Hoh Shando is Japan's number one martial art. We men have got to come through. We must defeat them. We must make sure we win. - I know we will win. We will fight to win. - Yu Yang, Yu Chung, please be careful. Doubtless you will go against them but then the Japanese are very cunning. No doubt of that. It's imperative to hold onto the herb. You see, there are thousands of people depend on us. - Be sure, me and my brother will do our best, you'll see. Rest assured, we'll keep the herb. - Hmm. But if Captain Kim were here right now, I'd feel a lot better. - Now, is he the one who caught all the criminals they say? - Surely. He has wiped out quite a few. Could be he's the man we want. Two times in Ching Sang, he's foiled the Japanese plans. - And who is it now he's investigating? - It's the infamous fugitive whose whole family were robbers. Jiang Wi-Jung, he is a clever fighter. Up in the north, he's slain some men and it's my guess that he'll be sentenced to death there and so he must move on. He will come here. (dramatic music) - Remember. You seem familiar, don't I know you from somewhere? - From where? - Eh, eh. I can't remember. - Has there been a man around here called Kim? - Eh, what's that? - Oh. I should say you may have seen a stranger here? - Uh, 'fraid not. It's hard to find this stretch of coastline, not many strangers find it. (laughs) - Oh. Thank you. He seems to be a bright guy although he's deaf and dumb. - Heh-heh, he can hear you speak though he can't speak back. I suppose you'll have to leave here soon. - Heh. Hmm. There's gonna be a duel here tomorrow, so I would like to see it. (dramatic music) - Look out. You gotta watch that guy very carefully. - [Man] Yeah, yeah, you gotta be careful. - We must all depend on you now. Lose this fight, we lose everything. - [Man] Yeah, that's right. - Listen a minute. You know that I won't let the Japanese get in if I can help it. (yelling) (dramatic music) Tighten your belt now. (yelling) - Here, you're gonna get those guys. (men talking over each other) (laughs) - Now, just relax and don't be nervous. - When he reaches you, you watch him. Be very careful. He's very quick, very fast indeed. - And don't forget to look out for his legs. You be on guard all the time. - And now, let the duel begin! (hands whooshing) - You're gonna be okay. Don't be nervous. - Well, this is it. Our blessings go with you. - [Man] Hey! Ya Ba! - [All] Huh? - That's Chen San's brother. - Isn't that Chen San's brother? What's he doing? - [Kuan Tai] Is that guy your brother? - He's not. - Oh, Chen San's brother, huh? - No, he's not worthy of the name! He's just a traitor! (blows thudding) (yelling) (dramatic music) (blows thudding) (yelling) - Hear me now. - What happened? - What happened? - What happened? - [Kuan Tai] Those two guys, Yu and Sang, proved to be much stronger than I had thought. It's important that we beat these guys now. We can't afford to lose face over this thing, especially as someone helped him. You were nearly killed just now when he threw that coin, just a little coin and he beat one of my best men. There's more power in that coin than in a fist. (laughs) To get that sort of skill, a man would have to train for years. - Who threw that coin, did you see? (laughs) - [Kuan Tai] I see all that goes on, I miss nothing. - A man called Sun is sent here. He's sure he comes to take a crop of the Dragon herb. - [Kuan Tai] Hmm, listen, Chen. Tomorrow, I want you to take some men and kill him. - The guy who threw the coin, what about him? - He's taking it off. - That means he'll do it himself. - Heh. - [Kuan Tai] I want him dead! (dramatic music) (wind whistling) (bird screeching) (dramatic music) - Well, what's the matter? - You should know what it is. - Oh? I like to mind my own business, that way I don't get involved. - That so? It's not that simple. - Just what do you want? - Heh. Ah. Hmm. Well, what do you know? He's a skinny guy. - You take him. (hands whooshing) (yelling) (blows thudding) - Stop now. (dramatic music) - Hmm, so, it seems that you're the big boss. Show me what you do. Don't waste my time because I'm in a hurry. - Hurry? - To leave this village. - Then you aren't from this area? - Course, I'm not. You must be deaf or something. I'm just a silly guy who keeps out of these things. - Just where are you off to? - Not your business. (dramatic music) - So, you can go and I won't try to stop you, just this time. (laughs) Go. - You think you've been so smart we don't know why you're here but, I tell you, you won't get a sprig of herb neither will you get away. (laughs) - You don't scare me and you'll soon see which side will win here. - Hmm. (yelling) (blows thudding) (dramatic music) (blows thudding) (yelling) (dramatic music) (waves roaring) - Why aren't you practicing? - Sang is gone, been murdered by those thieves now and they'll think Sang can be used as a sort of bargaining power. So, they'll feel they can squeeze us like a lemon. - Nobody has seen you practicing except me. Those men won't defeat you easily. - No. I must say I don't think I can beat these men. With all them coming at us together, our men won't be able to win. I don't mind that. Losing or even death doesn't matter if we can keep the dragon herb. Nothing else is of any importance to me. - So, thousands of lives depend on us. Perhaps, we should just call on them and you say we and our village must die now. What for? We don't have to die here. Let them die now. Soho will thank us for it. - Xiao Lan. (dramatic music) - Hmm. (heavy breathing) (dramatic music) Ah! It's the plague. The plague! - Huh? - Quickly, Ya Ba, go and bring some dragon herb here. (dramatic music) Ya Ba, go and light that fire now. - Huh. (dramatic music) - You're very lucky to have come here. (dramatic music) - Master, the dragon herb is still there. - Right! - Right! (thudding) - Nothing here. Nothing here. - Huh? (yelling) - The Yu family must have hidden it. God damn. (whip cracking) (yelling) Huh. Hit hard. Stop. Hmm. Quick now, just tell me where the dragon herbs hidden. - Dog, I don't know. - Oh? Heh-heh. You don't know? Beat him again. - Yes, sir. (whip cracking) (yelling) - Hm. (laughs) Right. (screaming) How are you feeling? Now, surely, we don't have to kill you then, maybe you'll just tell us now, huh. - Pig. Filthy stinking dog! I wouldn't tell you even if I knew! - You little swine. Add another! (screaming) - Chen San. How can you do this dreadful thing? You bring the Japanese and they'll kill your brother, thanks to you. Have you a heart in your body or has your conscience died as well? (sobbing) With a son who is a bastard traitor, we cannot lift our heads and face the villagers here. Better to die right here and now. Woe, what is my life to you? - Mother! - What is my life to you? You better let these villagers go at once or I'll call a curse upon you. (sobbing) - Here, take these two away then! - [Man] One minute! - Ma. - He's not a son of mine. - Ah come on, let's release them. Better let them go now. - [Man] Sir, sir! (dramatic music) - Wait now! I'm so glad. You've been ill a long time. You had the plague. You'll be alright now, my son. Ya Ba made some dragon herb tea each three hours or so. All night, he was right here. - Thank you, Ya Ba, thanks so much. - Ya Ba and the dragon herb saved your life. - Dragon herb? - Hmm, surely, Japanese came to grab it for their leader. Two men have been taken away. They want the herb. The village is full of them. Seems like the entire Yu family is going out to fight them. (dramatic music) (mumbles) (moans) No! Stay where you are. You're too weak now. Rest here a few days. - [Man] Come on. Check around here. - It's Chen San and the Japanese. They're looking for the herb. It's so worrisome. - Aye! - [Kuan Tai] Chen San? - Huh? - [Kuan Tai] Where's the herb then? - Uh. Heh-heh. We're searching every crack and cranny in the whole village. It's just where can it be now? But I know I'll find it now for you. - [Kuan Tai] Stupid! - Chen San, you told us when we came finding the herb would be easy. What do you say now? - Chen San, are you trying to fool us, you idiot of a traitor? - I would not dare, no trick, sir. You mustn't believe that. - Time is running out now. What if they dispatch reinforcements here? Things could get messed up. (mumbles) Get everything ready. We'll go to the Yu brother's place. - Right. - Right. - Wait there. Why waste time? The herb's been hidden secretly, so I think you're wasting your time to go out there. Well, I have a good idea. - Hmm, you and your ideas. They never seem to work. - Heh, this time is different. - [Kuan Tai] Hmm. (dramatic music) - You go first then. I'll come and see you later on. Lock the door carefully. Don't come out of doors. - Right. Oh, wait a minute. For you. - [Yu Yang] Thank you, you're very kind. I'll wear it always. I'll go now. - See you (door clicking shut) (dramatic music) (whistles) (screaming) Let me go! No! No, no! - Brother. Xiao Lan made it. - Hmm. Yu Yang. I have the most dreadful fears, seems like the quiet before a storm. It's too quiet, the Japanese will try something. I have a feeling. - Teacher! Chen San sent this letter. - Huh. Huh? Huh? Xiao Lan has been kidnapped. (dramatic music) - No! - Yu Yang! Yu Yang! - I must rescue her! I must! - Yu Yang! Don't be stupid! They have asked us to go to White Dragon Mountain, so you can tell Xiao Lan must still be alive. They need her. Early tomorrow morning then, she'll still be there when we go up. (dramatic music) (yelling) (thudding) (dramatic music) (insects chirping) (door creaking) (blow thudding) (laughing) - I know that you feel very sorry. Xiao Lan is just a corpse. You've come too late. It's a shame, huh. She's lying inside, you can go see her. - [Yu Yang] Xiao Lan! (blows thudding) (yelling) - [Kuan Tai] Hold it! Now, until we get the herb, we'll hold him. (dramatic music) - Yu Yang! Yu Yang! Yu Yang, Yu Yang! Ya Ba! Ya Ba! - Huh! - Ya Ba, listen to me. You know we'll fight the Japanese. (groaning) You have just seen Yu Yang? - [Ya Ba] Mm-hmm. - Hmm. He could have been captured by Japanese. (groaning) Ya Ba, you mustn't go. Think now. You know just where the herb is, you mustn't show anyone. You hear what I say? - Mm-hmm. - If something happens to me, you must hide yourself in another place because Chen San won't let you go. (dramatic music) Do as I tell you now. You must take Captain Kim to the place where the herb lies. You hear? I'm going. (groaning) So, the stranger? Now, why didn't they tell me? Can't I trust anyone? When he leaves, he can take the herb with him. Hmm. Right, but you tread warily. It is our secret. (dramatic music) - Now then, where were you going? Running to the place where the herb is hidden? Right then. (screaming) (dramatic music) Damn it! (dramatic music) - You're a bunch of evil-hearted rats! Release our people right away! (laughs) - You know your brother was not invited to come up here but this kind of business can easily be settled. - Now, what do you want? - [Kuan Tai] Just one thing. You just tell us where that herb is hidden and we'll let Yu Yang and Xiao Lan go. - You pig! (laughing) - Don't be insulting. I know of your deep affection. Yu Yang is the apple of your eye. You brought him up yourself. (laughs) Yu Chung, I'll give you a minute simply to cool off then, if you've still got nothing to say, nothing can stop us from killing your brother. (dramatic music) Time's up! Okay then! (laughing) - No deal, me and my brothers will make any sacrifice to keep that herb from the Japanese. No! - Now, I'm gonna kill you! (yelling) (blows thudding) - I'm going. Please go back, I'm better now. - Thanks so much for all that money. - It's nothing. Get Ya Ba to buy a new set of clothes. But then where is he just now that I'm leaving? When he gets back, you must tell him that I'm grateful. - [Man] He left early this morning and I haven't seen him since. As I understood him, he was gonna fetch some herb for you to take with you. - Ah. That was very kind, but there's no need. I'm completely recovered. Where did he go to? - Eh. Well, I really don't know where. (laughs) - I shouldn't really ask. - Hey, hang on. This is yours then. Please take it. - Oh, thank you. I thought I'd lost it. - You better be careful and luck go with you. (dramatic music) - You knew all along then just who I am. - No, I've only known for two days. Only Ya Ba knows it too. So then, while it is still easy, quick, go now. - I'm sorry. I prefer to stay here and fight the Japanese. - But you know it's too risky, better go on your way. Quick now, quick now. - Grandpa, I'll see you. (dramatic music) Ya Ba, Ya Ba! Ya Ba, Ya Ba! Ya Ba, Ya Ba! Ya Ba. (somber music) (dramatic music) - [Kuan Tai] Yu Chung was jinxing us. Now he's out of the way, Yu Yang has to die. Better get on with it. - [Men] Ha. (sobbing) (laughs) - Oh, it's Miss Chen, what do you want then? - My mum is sick, sir. I've come for my brother. - Heh. Hey, your brother's inside, so let's go, huh. Hai. (dramatic music) Follow me. (laughs) Your brother's out, so play with me. (screaming) (dramatic music) - [Miss Chen] Let me go! Let me go! Let me go, let me go! (screaming) (dramatic music) (groaning) - Ya Ba knew just where the herb was hidden, but he didn't get far. Now, how about you? (yelling) (blow thudding) You better speak up quickly. Ya Ba wouldn't speak and we've already sent him to a better place now. - Huh? (blows thudding) (yelling) (dramatic music) - Grandpa, grandpa! Grandpa! Grandpa! Please wake up now. Easy now. Grandpa, it's me now. Grandpa. - Give Ya Ba revenge. The herb's now in the White Snake Cavern. Keep 'em safe. (dramatic music) - Grandpa, grandpa, grandpa! (somber music) (dramatic music) - Beware! Beware! (yelling) - You fool, you must be blind, you idiot! - So sorry, so sorry, I didn't know it was my sister. Enjoy yourself, just enjoy yourself, but now that stranger's come back quietly. - [Man] Who? - No one can figure out who he is, but he's already killed some of our Japanese friends. - Huh? - He has. We better go tell teacher. He'd better get rid of that guy. - No need to tell him. Now, you quickly go to Yu's gymnasium and call all the students together. We shall go and beat them. (dramatic music) - All right. There they are all tied up tight. - Hmm. - Heh-heh. Listen, you will die here, killed just like a stuffed pig, if you don't tell me now right away where the herb has been hidden. If you don't, every three minutes one of you will die here then until you tell just where the herb is. Now, get ready. (waves roaring) (watch ticking) Time's getting short, you'll die soon. Five seconds. Four seconds. Three seconds. Two seconds. So, time is up. (watch ticking) - Ha! (yelling) (blow thudding) - Now then, so why you being so damn foolish? Heh? (watch ticking) Your time is nearly up now. Three seconds, two seconds. One second. Now, tell me now! (yelling) (dramatic music) (blows thudding) (yelling) - I've come too late. - I thought you had left here for good. Why aren't you on your way? - I smelt the blood from 10 miles away. - Stubborn as mules they are. They only need to talk and blood would not be spilled again. - Don't you see they'll all die here? They will die rather than tell, so thousands will be saved. They would rather die. - Then I'll oblige them. - I prefer them alive. Will you release them if I tell you right now? (laughs) - What makes you think I'll believe you? - If you knew what my name was, you might change your mind. - Who? - Jiang Wu-Ke. (dramatic music) (laughs) - So, you are the always on the wing fugitive. Taking quite a risk, aren't you then? If you're caught, it's the end of the line. - So then, when you have released them, there is something I shall want in return. I would like to take a trip with you on your ship. - Bastard! - What do you think? - Your request will be granted that I can promise you, but first I must know where the herb is hidden. - White Snake Cove. - Right, heh-heh! Of course, it's obvious. It must be there. - You traitor! (yelling) - [Man] You sold us out! - You traitor! - Release them at once! - [Man] Traitor! (men yelling) (dramatic music) - Swine! - Traitor! - You! (dramatic music) - [Kuan Tai] Now, you'll lead us to where it's hidden. - [Chen San] Sure, come on. - Wait! The deal was I would tell you, not that I would have to go with you. - It really doesn't matter. I know the place, come on. - No deal. You can know the truth. You'll never have the herb at all. - What do you think you're up to? - You'd better know I shall get what I have come all this way for. - There's something else you should know. To get it, you guys have got to get past me, you'll see that. - We're wasting too much time here. Kill him now! - Hold it. I think you've lost your mind. You're still a wanted outlaw, sentenced to death. Why are you losing your only chance to escape from this place? Just to go against us? (laughs) - Perhaps, I'm a fool. I don't know. But I know this, you'll never beat us Chinese. Never! - Hmm. So, now we will carry out the sentence of death. Kill him! (yelling) (hands whooshing) (blows thudding) (rope swishing) (waves roaring) (laughs) (suspenseful music) (yelling) (blows thudding) (groaning) (yelling) (blows thudding) (weapon swooshing) (waves roaring) (weapons clanking) - Fugitive, Fugitive! Fugitive! (mumbles) Sure, we've beaten them and it's due to your bravery. You've saved all of us. - I just wanted us to help each other out. - Don't speak, your wounds need attention. Can you stand up now with me? - I cannot. (dramatic music) I really can't. - [Yu Yang] You must, you must. - Better this way. This has been such a great day for me too. Yu Yang, will you tell Captain Kim that I didn't try to escape. Ya Ba and I will stay here and guard the herb. Forever and ever. - Fugitive! Fugitive! Fugitive! Fugitive! (dramatic music) (Multicom jingle)
