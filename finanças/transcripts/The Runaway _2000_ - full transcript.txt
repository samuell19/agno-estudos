[Captioning sponsored by CBS and Hallmark Cards] His name is Son Joshua and my hand is on him. There's a white boy being born right this minute this night. His name is Luke. Shh, shh, shh. They are bound together. Bound? Together, they will make change. My hand is on them, both of them. Luke! Sonny's coming up the road! Luke, do you hear me?! Brought some sardines and soda crackers. Good. I like soda crackers. So we're all set then? I guess. You're not going to back out, are you? No. Good. We're going now. Okay. Fine. Hey, Sonny. Hey. How's your mother and Remona? They doing all right? Good. They're fine. Now don't you let him keep you up all night with his stories. I'm used to his stories. Bye. Bye. Hey... What are you doing? Sit down. What for? Sit down. I'll show you. All right, now hold your arms up. Hey... It's got to look like we were kidnapped and dragged off. Kidnapped? Sure. That's part of my plan. There. Looks just like something an escaped convict would do. Hadn't I better drag you, now? No. They could've picked me up and carried me. You're the one that had to be dragged. Now, come on. It's getting late. I don't know about this, Luke. I never run away before. Well, I did, a hundred times. And you got found a hundred times, too. All those other times... they was just practice. This is the real thing. That's why I asked you to come with me. I don't know... What about Atlanta? And New Orleans? Remember what you said? Any place is better than here. I found this here the other day. It's a perfect way to get us downriver. You mean, we're going to steal it? It's not stealing. We're just going to take it for a while, that's all. I don't know, Luke. Look at this bone. Yeah, I bet it's from a bear. Or a cow maybe. Now make up your mind. You coming with me or you want to stay here? I want to go with you. Well, come on, then. So what do we have here, Hugh? Two boys gone missing. Ma'am. It's Luke, Sheriff, and Reba's boy. It's my boy, Sonny. When they didn't come back this morning, I... Come back? From where? This is the way I found it when I came to fetch them for breakfast. I knew he was going to run away again. Again? We don't know that, Troy. That Luke, he got a bit of rabbit in him. Must've run off at least a dozen times I know of. We thought he was over it, Sheriff. Sonny never run off. Not once. Luke, is running away always this easy? Nah. I don't usually go in a boat. Okay, this group, take the woods to the east and this group, the fields to the south. Everybody grab a map. We're going to have to cover every square inch around here. I'll take one of those. Isn't that kind of a waste of a good map? They got a right to look. There's two boys lost out there and one of them is his nephew. Okay, let's get a move on. Luke... how we going to live when we get to wherever we're going? Well, I thought we could kind of live like Robin Hood. You know, take what we need. People will try to kill us if we do that. Nobody gonna kill us. My daddy got killed. But... he wasn't taking anything from anybody. Pegleg done it. Your daddy sure was nice. Come on in. Hello, Amy. Have you seen Jule? I need him over at the farm. Well, he's out with the rest of 'em looking for Luke and Sonny. You gonna help look? Ain't that what we got a sheriff for? We're moving a lot faster than a while back. We sure are. You hear that? What is that? Paddle, Sonny! We better get back to shore! We're going too fast! Get to paddling and come on, get over here, now! We got to turn it around! My paddle! It's too strong. We're gonna go over! Sonny! Sonny! Come on... Come on, Sonny. No sign yet but don't worry, we're going to keep looking. We'll find them. Well, come on. You men must be starving. Thank you. Help! Somebody, please help us! Come on, Sonny. Don't you go dying on me. ...and this time we'll start south of the railroad tracks right along the old creekbed. You take your group first... I found this in Luke's room. They're on the river. Look. It's even got the pages here. Luke? Sonny? Sheriff! Come on, Sheriff, hurry. Get him in the boat, quick. Luke, you all right? Yeah, but Sonny's hurt real bad. I see. Here we go. Sonny going to be just fine. I'm sure he is. Just keep an eye on him. If you need me, have Mrs. Winter give me a call. Thank you, Doctor. Remona, Cecily. Don't worry now. He'll come around. Hey, Doc, how's he doing? He's in a coma. He probably hit his head on the side of the boat. Could be bad. We'll see how it goes the next couple days. Thank you, Doctor. Sheriff. Hey, Doc... I got a question for you. Do you have any idea... What kind of bone this is? It's a femur. Leg bone. Hip to the knee. That's human? Sure is. Where'd you get it? It just turned up. Well, there's a lot more of him to turn up if that's all you got. Sheriff. How you doing, Troy? Luke around? Yes, sir. I'll get him. Luke. Sheriff's come to get you. Come to take you to jail, I hope. Morning, Luke. Let's you and me take a little walk. What do you say? Let's you and me take a little walk. Is it Sonny? Is he...? He's still asleep as far as I know. Listen, when I found you boys there was a bone next to your blanket. You had that a while, have you? No, we just found it yesterday. Really? Whereabouts? It was over by Carnes' old mill near where we found the boat. You remember exactly where you found it? Mrs. Carnes? Yes. I'm Frank Richards. Oh, sure, I remember you. It's been a few years. I believe so. Since just before you got married to... Jim. He passed, you know. Four years ago. I heard. You have my sympathies, ma'am. I-I-I'm sorry. Could I offer you some iced tea? I have some already made. Thank you, yeah. Appreciate it. Please. Sorry to bother you like this. I've just been down to your old sawmill. The mill? Why on earth for? Yesterday we had two boys run away. Oh, yes, I heard. Amy Winter called me. But you found them. Yes. She said that the colored boy was injured. Is he...? He's still in a coma. Oh, my. Anyway, they passed through your property by the mill, and they found a bone. A human bone. And I just found the rest of the body. Body? Whose body? Don't know. Looks like it's been there a long time, though. And I was wondering if you had any ideas... No, certainly not. Why, that mill's just been sitting empty since Jim got sick. Anybody could have come along and... I understand. And Jim, before he died he never said anything...? No. Of course not. You think Jim knew a body was buried there? I don't think anything yet, ma'am. Just wondering. I don't mean to upset you, ma'am. It is upsetting. A body buried on my property... it is very upsetting. Of course. I'm sorry. Well, I better get going. Thank you for tea. Pegleg? You think it's connected to him? Only unsolved murders we got around here that I know of. And that was years ago. Thank you, Meg. I remember hearing about it though. Three victims, right? Yeah, three of them. Abducted, never seen again. That supposed to be him? That Pegleg? All the witnesses described him the same way. He was a man wearing a leather hood. And he had a limp. Sheriff Logan ever have a suspect? Well, you remember Logan. Yeah, I remember Logan. Had a peculiar sense of justice. Let me see that. Hey, you know who one of the last victims was? Who? Yeah. Rody Monroe. Sonny's dad? Mm-hmm. Now wouldn't that be something? Him finding the bone and all. It's R... it's Rody's shirt, all right. He was wearing it the night he was taken. I'm sorry to bring you news like this, Mrs. Monroe. We can have us a funeral now. You know, it never seemed right to have a funeral when there weren't no body. I just pray Sonny wakes up for it. I hope so, too. Don't walk in here. It's wet. What are you doing that for? Where's Remona? She's down sitting with Sonny. Reba, too. Well, what for? That's not going to make him wake up. See, why you always let them get away with that? And where is Jule? That fence ain't anywhere near fixed. Reba sent Jule for help. What, to fix a fence? Help for Sonny. Ah. All righty. No... No. I want you to go down there and I want you to tell Remona to come up here. Here, see you know, you're worse than they are. At least they don't suck on a bottle all day. I never picked up just bones before. Pug, you just go on out there and collect the body and prepare it for a funeral. After all this time, dig up a skeleton bury it again somewhere else. I'd say let sleeping dogs lie. Just do it. Excuse me, Mr. Holly. We have a few questions about Monica's burial. Of course, Mrs. James, how can I be of assistance? How are you doing today, Cecily? All right, I guess. I know it's been a while, but do you remember anything about the night that Pegleg took your father? Not really. The police report said that you were there. I was in the other room, with Sonny. How about your sister, Remona? Did she see him? Mm-hmm. How about your father? Did he have any enemies or owe people money? No, he was saving his money. So we wouldn't have to work for Harlan Davis anymore. How's Sonny? He's just the same. Cecily? You have work to do. Yes, sir. This here is Luke. Oh, I know him. He carries the sign. The change is coming soon. Luke and Sonny will make it together. Mama! Mama! What is it? He opened his eyes. Sonny's awake! Oh! Morning, Sheriff. Morning. Do you have a moment? Certainly, yes, please. Here. What can I do for you? It's about that body. Amy tells me you think it was Rody Monroe. Yes. Terrible thing. I remember the day Rody disappeared. Jim was in the hospital. I distinctly remember visiting Jim in the hospital the day that it happened. I just thought you should know that. I see. Thank you, but I-I don't want you to think that I was suggesting that Jim might be involved. Rody was buried on Jim's property. You wouldn't be much of a sheriff if you didn't wonder about that. Thank you for coming down. It's turning into another hot one out there. We don't even have a cold drink to offer you. Hugh, we should have some cold drinks in here. We are failing in our hospitality. Oh, you want me to run down and get some? Oh, I really should be going. Uh, well, you know what? I could use a cold drink, myself. Why don't we just go on down to Keeler's? All right. Got some work to do? Police officer in New York. My, that must have been exciting. Sometimes, a little too exciting. Mighty fortunate to have a sheriff with your experience. And your war record... it's really very impressive. I-I just... feel fortunate to be back home have a good job. Must seem awfully quiet here. Well, that's what I came back for. That, and the pecan pie, of course. Well, I understand that. I really do. I often cook up things we had when I was young. Just simple things. Reminds me of... oh, I don't know happier days, I guess. Before I left for the war, this seemed to be just about the happiest place in the world. And now? It's still pretty nice. But I've been away for quite some time. Some things that I took for granted don't seem quite so agreeable now. I hope you're not talking about the pecan pie. No, that's still as good as ever. I'm going to be, uh coming out your way again, soon. Well, you have to call ahead. I'll be sure to have a big pitcher of iced tea all made up. Thank you. Don't mean to bother you but we do still have to dig through the rest of those sawdust piles. Oh. Well, there are two victims still missing. And you think they're buried there? It makes sense to look. It would just take a day or so. Well, I really better be going. Leave you to your work. Bet you a nickel I can shoot this sweet potato off your head. Just like William tell. You told me that story before. It's an apple he shot. Well, apples aren't big enough this time of year. Besides, this potato's flat. It'll sit on your head just like a hat. Not my head it won't. If I'm going to be William Tell you have to be the son. Forget it. I don't want you shooting at me. You see that scarecrow? Put this on his head. See? That could have been my head. Sheriff! Luke's trying to kill me again. Is that right, Luke? I-I was wasn't really going to do it. I was just playing with him. Now, Luke, you got to watch out, okay 'cause sometimes your playing around can get people hurt. Sonny, is your mom home? She's... She's with Jule... buying a suit to bury his daddy in. Why do you want my mama? Just want to ask her a couple questions about the night your daddy was taken. Do you remember anything about that? Not really. I remember Mama and Remona hollering. I was out back. Where's Remona now? She's up at the house working for Mr. Davis. Tell me what you remember about that night. He just came busting through the door hit my daddy on the head with some kind of hammer and carried him off. But you couldn't see his face? He had a hood on. But I could see his skin. It was darker than mine. And he had a limp? It was Pegleg, I know that. Is there anything else you can remember? Any detail that maybe you haven't told everyone else? Now I see why nothing's getting done around here. Just checking on a few things, ma'am. Harlan won't like you bothering her when she's supposed to be working. Just doing my job. And now she's going to have to put in extra time. Wasn't her fault, Mrs. Davis. She knows if the sheriff asks questions she's supposed to answer. And she knows when she's got work to do she's supposed to do it. Say, Frank he was by a little bit ago. Said you were looking to investigate the Pegleg murders. That's right. That's old news, isn't it? Well, I don't know. Ben, what do you think? Three unsolved murders still news? Wasting your time looking for Pegleg. That's right, Sheriff. This is a nice peaceful community. Why resurrect all that Pegleg stuff? You just get out of here! Mr. Harlan... he just come at me. He didn't say one word. He just kept hitting me and hitting me. It's all right. You'll be fine. Nothing's broke. Come on. Harlan Davis hit Remona! You're arresting me for disciplining my own employee? I'm arresting you for assault and battery on a minor. Yeah, well... I might have to add resisting arrest to that charge, too. If I resist, you ain't going to be arresting me. You're right, Harlan. You resist and Pug Holly will be coming up here to collect your body. Hugh, if he doesn't drop that pitchfork in the next three seconds just go on ahead and shoot him. Wha...? Well, he's in jail. At least for tonight anyway. Thanks to our Luke here. Finally stopped making up stories and did something. Not just any old thing. The right thing. Most people around here wouldn't see anything wrong. It's the way they were brought up. I swear, sometimes I feel we're going backwards, not forward. Nobody wants to deal with it, not really. Deal with what? A sorry mess is what it is. Always has been. But me and Sonny, we'll always be friends. It's the livestock. They have to be fed before he gets home. I'll do it. Well, he wants you to fix that fence. I'll do that, too. Stay here with Remona. Tea leaves in a compress... it eases the pain. There he is. There he is. All right! Did you find another one, sheriff? Two. Well, well. You think they're Pegleg's work? Looks that way. You know what I heard about the first one? Reba bought a new suit to put on the skeleton. Suit? A good one, too. Imagine that. Dressing a skeleton up in a suit. Dear friends, our brother Rody Monroe has returned. He's returned to his family. He's returned to his community. And now we return his remains back into the hands of the Lord. The sadness of this occasion only magnified by the fact that everyone that knew Rody knows that this was a good man... a churchgoing, god-fearing man who worked hard to provide for his family. Worked hard to take care of his wife and children. Now, the circumstances surrounding his death might be unsettling and yes, they might cause some to be angry... Thank you, Reverend. We'll all rest better now. Miss Monroe? I just want to let you know that I'm still trying to find whoever killed your husband. Hey, wait up. Where are you going? Nowhere. Never seen most of these folks before. You never been to this church before. No, I guess not. Look, I'm, I'm sorry about your daddy. We found him. I'm not sorry about that. What? Come on. What is it? What's wrong? Luke, we friends, ain't we? Of course, we are. My mama's going to be mad. She said not to tell anybody. Tell anybody what? About Mr. Harlan and Remona. What about 'em? She's carrying his baby. What? You, you mean he...? He forced her. She told me last night. What are you going to do? There's nothing to do. You can get the sheriff. Yeah. He'd go after old Harlan. No. My mama says white folks ain't never going to help us. That we shouldn't tell 'em anything. Do you believe that? I don't know. I'm telling you, ain't I? Look, you've got to do something. You can't just let Harlan get away with that. My mama says that's just the way things are. But it's not right! Remember what Conjure Woman said? She said we're supposed to change things. I got to get back. I just felt I needed to tell you. It's a very serious crime, Luke. You did right to tell me. Come on, Avery. You're the county prosecutor. He forced that girl. Her word against his. No jury in this area would ever convict him. You know that. What if there was corroboration? Somebody to back up her story? You think you're going to find a witness? You're a vet, Avery. What did we fight for? A better world? The world right here is no better than it ever was. Harlan Davis can commit any manner of atrocity against this poor girl and you're telling me that there's not a thing that we can do. If there's no evidence, there's no case, Frank and no reason to cause trouble. Right. Sheriff Logan's law. I think it's time we repeal that law, Avery. Put it six feet under, right alongside Logan. Our new sheriff? I think he's just trying to make a name for himself at the expense of my little brother here. He's trying to impress somebody. He ain't impressing me. We all with you, Harlan. We know that little gal's a liar. That's right. You must think I'm crazy putting up all this fruit. No, ma'am. Not if you enjoy it. I do. Jim could never understand that. He thought I could just buy canned fruit at the store. I heard he could be a contrary sort of fellow. Jim? He was a charmer, though, when I first met him. But, yes, he could be hard on some people. At the mill, there was always trouble. Here, let me help you. Thank you. You've done this before? Once or twice. You're saying there was trouble at the mill? Oh, you know, the usual. Jim would fire people. They'd get pretty upset. Such as? Well, once this colored man came by the house at night insisted on talking to Jim. Jim went outside to talk to him. I heard arguing, angry voices. He seemed pretty mad about something. It must have been something pretty bad. Because after that Jim took to sleeping with a shotgun by the bed. When was that? I don't remember exactly. Was it before or after the Pegleg killings? Do you remember that? Uh... it was before. But just a little while before. Yes, that same summer. Might be a connection. I never thought of that. But you're right. Why, that man could have been Pegleg, couldn't he? He might have put those bodies out at the mill to get back at Jim in some way. Where did you hide that bottle? You don't even care. You don't care about me. You don't care what people are saying. Nobody believes it anyway. What difference does it make? I know what I believe. I believe her. I believe every word. You? You don't know nothing about it. I know this is the last time you've humiliated me. I'm not going to put up with your sick ways anymore. I'm going to tell everyone... Ah. I can get a deputy out here if you like. I can take care of myself, thank you. I guess you can. I just... I don't get it. Why would he come here? Why now? I have no idea. Maybe he was just trying to frighten you. Well, he succeeded at that. So that you wouldn't reveal something. I've told you I don't know anything. Maybe it's something you don't even know that you know. I know that a man broke into my house about scared me to death and I know it has something to do with those bodies you dug up. That's all I know, Sheriff. Ma'am. Mrs. Carnes? What is it? Ma'am, I just want to apologize to you. I know it must seem like all I do is treat you like you're some kind of a suspect. I don't mean to do that. None of this is your fault in any way. Well, I'm glad to hear you say that. Somehow I seem to be... rubbing everybody the wrong way. Everybody in town seems to be slamming the door in my face one way or another. Well, maybe it's because you've been away. Been through a war. Seen how other folks live. Take folks a little while to understand that. Just got to give them time. Well, I hope I get that time. I wasn't slamming the door in your face, Sheriff. I was just trying to keep the flies out. "Pegleg back! White woman attacked." That's just a bit inflammatory, don't you think, Ben? You're the one that wanted the case reopened. I don't recall seeing any headline about Harlan Davis assaulting a girl. That is an unproved allegation. Printing something like that would upset the entire community. Especially the colored. Now you wouldn't like that, would you, Sheriff? What I want is to find someone that's going to back up Remona's story so I can put Harlan Davis in jail where he belongs. I think you got your priorities all twisted, Sheriff. With Pegleg back in town and going after white folks you got yourself a real problem on your hands. You know what, Ben? I'm starting to think you're right. Hey, Coy? You got a minute? Well, I was just on my way to the bank. It'll just take a minute. You and Harlan Davis... you're friends, right? I no longer keep company with Harlan Davis. But you used to be friends? Wasted time, Sheriff. Shamefully wasted time. Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got to get to the bank. You know anything about Harlan and Remona Monroe? Why would I know anything about that? Did he say I did? No, no, just wondering. I-I told you... our paths have not crossed in some time. Not since I quit drinking and I'd just as soon keep it that way. Don't you go telling him I talked to you. Why? You afraid of Harlan? No. Of course not. I told you I don't even know him anymore. But based on your previous knowledge of the man, do you think it's possible that he might have done what Remona said? Harlan Davis is the most despicable man I ever met. I'm prepared to believe that. Anything specific? I have a dim recollection of that whole period. I-I don't know anything about Harlan Davis and any girl. Wait, y-you mean back then, when you were drinking? I'm saying I don't know anything about Harlan and any girl, now or any other time. Okay, Coy. I know how you feel about this... but if Remona doesn't testify how are we going to convict Harlan? I don't know. It's the only way to see justice done. If we can send Harlan to jail maybe things like this will never happen again. Y-you have to believe me. I-I'm, I'm trying. Cecily. Can I talk to you outside? How long you been living in town now? Four years maybe. Why? But before then, when you were... living at home there... you worked for Harlan and Alice Davis, didn't you? Up at their house? Didn't you? Yes. What were you then, 16, 17? Like what Remona is right now? Wouldn't you like to see Harlan Davis go to jail? It doesn't matter what I'd like. All that matters is the safety of my family. If Harlan was in prison your family would be safe. He's not the only white man around here. You have no idea what it means to be a black girl in the South. What is, what is this? This ain't dinner, uh-uh. I want hot biscuits with my dinner. I want gravy. Now you just... walk back to that stove and you fix me a proper meal. I wouldn't feed this slop to a hog. Could have sworn I just did. Oh! You thought you just did. You thought you just did. Uncle Jule, you better come out here. We don't work for you on Sunday. Now you know that. Yeah, well, Miss Alice ain't feeling well, and we need somebody to come up to our house and cook for us. W-well, you tell Miss Alice I'll bring her something... after we done had our supper. No, no, no. I'm hungry now. So why don't you just bring a piece of that chicken there up to the house and cook it for me? Please, Mr. Harlan, why don't you just go on home and let us be? Now you get yourself or one of your gals up to my house. Where are them gals anyway? Hey, Remona! Get down here! We don't want no trouble, Mr. Harlan. Well, there ain't going to be none if Remona come and cook for me. Ha-ha! There you are. Come on, honey. Just come on, honey. Come on. No, you go on back to your room, Remona. Hey, I told you that she was going to come up and cook at my place. Don't you hit my mama! You... what are you going to do about it? Please, Mr. Harlan, just go on home. As soon as I have my dinner. All right. I'll fix you something. Well, okay. All right, good. That's all I'm asking. That's all I'm asking. And me, and me and Remona, we're going to help you, too. Me and you, we'll cook up a stew, we do. You like stew, don't you? I-I seen you eat stew. Tell me you don't like it. Me and you... are going to cook up a stew. And you and me... how happy we'll be! You leave her alone. Well, I'll be. Are you going to shoot me, Sonny? If I got to, I will. You'd never do it. I will if you make me! Mr. Harlan... just go! Well, you know, shoot! I don't guess a piece of fried chicken's worth getting shot over, is it? I'll see you, Remona. I'll be going now. He pointed that shotgun right at his belly. Stared him down... cool as can be. Why, Mr. Harlan practically run back up to his place. He done it now just like his daddy. That's right, Ezra. Rody never wasn't scared of nobody. Mm-mm. No. Sonny ain't here right now. Oh, that's okay. I can wait. I don't want you waiting. It's not right. Not anymore. What's not right? You and him. Did he say that? I'm saying that. But... but we're friends. Now I want you to listen to me. Look where you live, child. You and him can't be friends. Can't you see that? I know that you didn't mean no harm about Remona... and your mama has always been kind to us. But it's better for everybody if we just stay with our own from now on. What are you going to do with that thing? You stay away from my sisters. What are you going to do if I don't? What you going to do, Sonny? You didn't see anyone? No. You have any idea who might have done this? No. What are you wasting time for, Sheriff? It was Pegleg. You ought to be out looking for him right now! Now, Mason, we don't know who did this, okay? We have to collect some facts here. Sheriff! What is it, Luke? Did you catch him yet? Um, Pegleg. Not yet. It was Pegleg who did it, wasn't it? Maybe, Luke, I don't know. But whoever it was, don't you worry. We're going to catch him. But it must have been Pegleg, though, don't you think? Luke, we're a little busy right now, okay? I'm sorry. Anyway, that's not all of it. County prosecutor left you an urgent message said he needs to see you right away. Apparently, Jule Monroe was going around town yesterday afternoon bragging about how Sonny threatened Harlan with a gun. Can I go with you? Please, Sheriff, it's real important. No, Luke, okay? I want you to go home and stay calm. You and everybody else in this county. Mr. Harlan was drunk. Sonny just meant to scare him off. Sonny got Mr. Harlan to go on home and then we sat down to a nice dinner. And that's all there was to it. You didn't follow Harlan up to his house? No, sir. You didn't shoot him? No. What kind of gun was it? It was a shot... Just my old shotgun. It been fired recently? Uh, no, sir. Not in some time. You mind if I take a look at it? You sure you put it underneath there? I'm sure. Somebody must've took it. Sonny's just a kid, Avery. Kid or no kid, he had motive, opportunity... And you believe he did it? I'm just a prosecutor. It's up to the jury to decide whether or not he did. Come on, Avery, you know what juries are like around here. This kind of situation... We have an explosive case here, Frank. The sooner we act on this, the better. Now you got to bring him in. How's your father doing? I haven't seen him around in a while. My father? He's fine. Glad to hear it. I always liked him. He's a good man. And an excellent lawyer. He was the best. Till I came along. No... No! Why you taking my baby?! He ain't done nothing! Hope you're right, Reba. But I have to do this. I'll make sure he's protected. You have my word. Why they taking my baby?! Sonny! It's gonna be all right, baby! It's gonna be all right! Sonny! Oh, why they taking my baby... We just can't have the prosecutor's own father representing the defendant. As a prosecuting attorney of this county for over 30 years I believe I have the qualifications... I'm not talking about qualification. I'm talking about you going up against your son. I agree, Your Honor. This is not suitable. There is no rule against a retired district attorney appearing for the defendant... I still don't like it. As I recall, the law of this state it is not up to the presiding judge or the prosecuting attorney to determine who is the defense counsel. Now, the defendant's own mama has asked me to represent her son. And gentlemen that is exactly █ what I intend to do. That true? Yes, sir. 'Cause of death was a shotgun blast right in the chest. He couldn't have been more than six... seven feet away... Your Honor... the witness's gesture is extremely prejudicial. I... The witness was not there. He could not possibly know who pulled the trigger. The jury will disregard the gesture. Now, can you tell us what kind of shotgun pellets you found in the body? Sure can. 12-gauge standard bird shot. I was just telling the boys how Sonny kept Mr. Harlan from bothering us. By pointing a gun at him? Yes. And threatening to use it? Yes. And that was your shotgun he was pointing at Harlan Davis. The same gun that is now nowhere to be found. What kind of shotgun was that? 12-gauge. And what kind of ammunition did you use in this shotgun of yours? Oh, just regular ammunition. Isn't it true that your shotgun was loaded with 12-gauge standard bird shot ammunition? Yes, sir. Well, it was a little after 4:00. I got home, got out of the car and noticed that the barn door was wide open. I went to close it and... found my husband shot to death. And what did you do then? I... ran into the house and called the Sheriff, of course. Thank you, Mrs. Davis. That'll be all. Your Honor, I have just a couple of questions for Mrs. Davis. Mrs. Davis. About your husband... would you describe him as a kindly man? No. I-I'm not sure... No, I understand. Let me put it a different way. Was he well-liked in the community? Let me put it this way. Did your husband have a temper? What do you mean? I mean, isn't it true he was a, a violent and abusive man? Your Honor...! And a mark of that abuse has been seen on your face... many, many times, ma'am. In fact, there's a trace of it right now. This is out of order and offensive to the witness. Your Honor... my apologies to Mrs. Davis. Just simply trying to demonstrate there are many, many people in this community... have a good reason to shoot Harlan Davis. I have nothing further to say. Hello, Mrs. Carnes. Hello, Sheriff. Give you a hand with that? No, thank you. I'm fine. I'm headed over to a coffee shop to get something to eat. You care to join me? I'm afraid I can't. Amy asked me to accompany her on an errand. We're going to help Alice dispose of Harlan's effects. She seemed anxious to get it done in a hurry. I can understand that, given... What he was like. I'll say. You knew him, did you? Hardly. He used to come around sometimes to see Jim. A drinking buddy. That's what Jim called him. Here I am. Let me get the door for you. You take a number of your meals at the coffee shop, don't you? Uh, quite a few, yes. Well, I was wondering if you might enjoy a nice home-cooked meal sometime. Yes. I certainly would. All right then. Ma'am. Sheriff! What is it, Luke? It's about Mrs. Davis. What she said this morning. She didn't come home and find the barn open. She was there all along. How do you know this, Luke? Well, I... It was... it was just obvious she was lying. I know she was. Luke, if you're going to accuse folks of lying it's best to have some proof, okay? What are you going to do with all this? Get rid of it. Get rid of all of it. One pair of bloodstained gloves. One bloodstained hammer. One jar of theatrical makeup to blacken one's face. And one... leather hood with the eyeholes cut out. I submit that this evidence conclusively proves that Harlan Davis was Pegleg. No! Justice was done. This does not exonerate the defendant. Thank you for coming. My pleasure. Coffee? Coffee? Thank you. I'm sorry I don't have much else to offer you right now. That'd be fine. We've had quite a day. Yes. Certainly cleared up a few things. But not everything. It's been so frustrating trying to get people to talk. I don't know, maybe I've gone about it the wrong way. I know I've upset you. I'm sure sorry about that. Appreciate it. Thank you. Maybe I'm not going to find out why Harlan killed those men and buried them at the mill. Maybe it's not even important anyway. No, it is important. I didn't want to make the connection, but I should have when I heard about Remona. Remona? What connection? I hardly knew Jim when I married him. I was young... he seemed so successful, so charming. I didn't know him at all. It came out gradually... the meanness, the drinking. You just learn to live with it. But I was not prepared for... the other. I came home one day and I heard them in the basement. Jim and Coy and Harlan. Jim and his friends liked to go down in the cool and play cards and drink. I heard them bragging. Jim... crowing about all the girls he'd been with... and he was planning to be with. It was like a contest, you see with Harlan and Jim and Coy and others, too. I don't know. I should have said something. But I was so ashamed. To have been married to a man like that. I'm still so ashamed. Anyway, I think that's why those men were killed... because they knew what Harlan and Jim were doing. And I think now that... Jim knew Harlan killed those men. And I think it was that knowledge that gave him the cancer. Come on in, ladies. They're expecting y'all. Frank. Thank you. Please come on in. Thank you for coming. Please, sit. We've asked you here because we want to talk to you about something. We want you two younger ladies to testify. We want you to talk about Harlan. About what he did to you. Both of you. No. I don't want that. None of it. It don't have nothing to do with Sonny. True. Not directly. But this entire trial should be about Harlan not about Sonny. Ain't there some other way? I am tired of my babies being hurt. I agree. But we have to expose what's been going on here. Put an end to it. We can't force you girls to do this. We wouldn't do that. Too much of that's been done already. But... we are asking you. Sheriff. You said you needed proof about Mrs. Davis. That's right. Well, I have proof. She was lying. You said that before, Luke. Well, yeah, but I didn't tell you how I know. I was there. There where? I was on the road near Sonny's. I heard the shot. I looked up to the Davis house and the car was there under the tree. She didn't come home later. She was already there. Are you sure about this, Luke? You're not making this up, are you? No. This is very important, Luke, okay? I need to know exactly what you saw. I saw her car. It was there by the barn. You see anything else? Nothing. You were how old at that time? Sixteen. What'd you do? I told my mama and my daddy. And I told them about the other girls, too. Other girls? Yes. Mr. Harlan, Mr. Jim, Mr. Coy... They all bragged about being with other girls. What's the relevance of this testimony? Your Honor, I will show you the point just as... All right, proceed. What happened after you told your parents? Then my daddy went to Mr. Harlan and insisted that he stop. But he didn't. Then my daddy told Sheriff Logan. What'd the sheriff do? Nothing. Then what happened? Then Pegleg killed my daddy. And those other men too I was telling you about. They were all related to the other girls. A father or brother... and each one of them tried to get Mr. Harlan to stop. That's why they were killed. And when Harlan Davis began assaulting you over a year ago, you didn't tell anyone. Not even your mama? No, sir. Why not? What good would it do? I knew if I said anything somebody going to get killed. Maybe my mama. Only way for you to protect yourself and your family... shield them from any further violence was for you to suffer your humiliations in silence is that correct? Yes, sir. Your Honor, there is enough guilt in this town to go around but none of it belongs to Sonny Monroe. I move this case be dismissed immediately for lack of any credible evidence against the defendant. Your Honor... What about my brother's murder? You be quiet. I'm tired of all these diversions. And you, sir I want to know right now if the prosecution has any evidence at all? Do you have the missing gun? We have the fact that it's missing. I'm dismissing this case right now and ordering the release of the accused. Your Honor, I wish you wouldn't do that. Sonny's safe in jail. Can't we just keep him there until everyone calms down? You want to keep him in jail, fine. But if you do not come up with any additional evidence implicating him by 6:00 this evening, he's going free. All right, all right. He killed my brother Harlan Davis! My brother! Guy killed him! Shot his shotgun! Knock the door down! I'll let you talk to him, Luke, on one condition: That you tell me everything that you saw, okay? Somebody's life may depend on this. Just, just let me talk to him first, please? I haven't told about you, Sonny. Not anyone. But now you've got to. You've got to tell the sheriff. Why should I trust him? You heard what happened when Cecily told Sheriff Logan. He killed my daddy. And now they're going to try to kill me one way or another. He's not Logan, Sonny. You've got to trust somebody. I trust you, Luke. Well, all right, then. That's a start. So when nobody answered the door I went over to the barn. Harlan come at me and grabbed the gun right out of my hands. You didn't see anyone else out there? No, Harlan scared me so I ran over to the side of the barn and then I heard a shot, so I ran. He was running, all right. Did you see any cars parked up there? Miss Davis' car was parked under a tree. It was there. I saw it. You said you knocked on the door of the house before you went to the barn. Yeah, but nobody answered. She was there. I know she was. We both saw the car. You believe me, don't you? We better let the judge hear all this. We better step on it. Come on. Let's go. Hand him over, Sheriff, or we'll come get him. Not going to be easy getting him through this crowd. Maybe not but that's my job. Our job. You ready? Stay close. You going someplace? That's right, Mason. I'm going to take this young man home and then I'm going to go and arrest your brother's murderer. Now step aside. Sonny. If the kid didn't do it, who did it? Coy? Was it Coy? Did you see the way he ran out of the courtroom? If it was Coy, I'm going to get him. I'll kill him with my bare hands! I'll get him with my bare hands! I'll kill him! Sonny? Sonny! Oh, Sonny, oh, baby! Oh, baby! Oh! Oh, Sonny! Sonny. You take care. Thank you, Sheriff. Go ahead, Mrs. Davis. I heard a noise and woke up and I saw Sonny leave the barn so I went out there, and Harlan... he started talking about Remona again the way he did. Made me sick. He told me to mind my own business and then he come at me and that gun was lying right there at my feet. It was self-defense. You, you'll get a trial... and a fair one, I promise you. Tell me, what did you do with the gun? I dropped it right there. I know I did. I don't know what happened to it. Okay. You have to come with me, Mrs. Davis. So, you want to come over to my house? I can't. I got chores. Anyway, I'll see you later, then? Sure thing. All right. We found you and we found your killer. I can't ask for more. Change has started and we will all ask for more. It won't be easy. We'll have to accept some things we don't like things that hurt... but... we will ask for more. Even Joshua will ask your permission to leave home and you will let him. Something wrong, Sheriff? No. No, I'm just wondering which I'd like more: another piece of that pecan pie or to just sit here and enjoy the night air with you. I don't see any reason why you can't have both, Sheriff. You calling me "Sheriff" makes it feel like I'm here on police business. Are you here on police business? No, ma'am. I don't believe I am. Well... Oh, I'm so glad you all came around. You're good boys. Let me show you something. Here is the gun that everyone is looking for. And now, I'm going to get rid of it for once and for all. You won't be needing it. I mean, guns won't help you make the change you got to make. It's going to take hard work. My mama says it's time for me to leave. Well, that's right. Do you know what you're going to do? You're going to leave here. You're going to go up to the highway. You're going to catch a ride to Atlanta. And that's just the first of many stops you will make in your life. You have far to go. You are going to make a difference. And so will you. You will make a difference. Am I going with him? No. No, but your life will have as much purpose as his. No, you're going to stay here awhile and make change right in this town. Come here, boys. You have hard work ahead of you. It's going to be hard. But you're going to come through. My hand is on you. It's been on you since you were born. So go. Go. Go quickly. Go on. Shoo. Go. Make change. Come on, darling, get in. Looks like my ride. Luke, when you saw me running down from Harlan's why didn't you tell anybody? Tell me the truth, Luke. You thought I shot him, didn't you? Well... no. I-I didn't. We're bound, Sonny. Like Conjure Woman said... we're bound together. Yeah, Luke, we are. I'll see you again, Sonny. [Captioning sponsored by CBS and Hallmark Cards]
