Looking through the log, I got what I wrote the night I ran the Tudor "The worst day of my life." Now think with more îngãduinþã at the absolute superlative, which would have to do and in the evening trying not to exaggerate. If it was to write something that night, then I would have written: October 22, 1936, Just another unhappy day of my life. You know,'re more beautiful now than you ever. Maybe I'm in love. You have to take care, many men a run after you. My luck. A you will be missing me, Eva, more than you realize. I love you. Sleep now.

He sold the forest, somehow, cottage, everything that belonged to it. A! you did n't know! You don't have to tell me what to do with things that belong to me. Not to tell his fiancée ...

You must go, is your chance for a new beginning. - Give me ... - The carriage is waiting. Thank you, Irene. I do not... Go, you don't get worried. I'm glad for Betty, but at the same time I could not help thinking that Mom was now closest to Betty, after everything that happened, Although he refuses to accept the truth. Maybe and that her state of health has deteriorated so rapidly. To stay away from me. Maybe someday you'll understand that all men are the same, And that actually is not so bad a guy. At least I'm here and I will always be. Get out of my room! Going to happen, one way or another, it's your choice. I prefer to die than to touch me, Disgusting old woman you are.

Suddenly my mind was fully illuminated. I had an answer: I hated him now, Because he crushed my life closing it in a horizon without the Exit And wherever turned my head, I could see only himself ...

Please stay, this time, for me. I can not. Every Friday night after 8 o'clock, I'll call. There you will. Within a few months, Romania entered the war on German's side. In those days I joined a committee sponsored by the Queen Mother Elena, to help the injured and the bereaved families. Collect donations, set up canteens for disabled and orphans. At a concert to raise funds, I met Dr. Gunther Bohm. I said that I would like to work as a sister of charity at the Military Hospital. Eva, are you? Lucian, Constanta, September 1938.

First in Cairo after that ... I do not know. You wanted to ask me something? Yes, one moment. I have an idea about a business. Here are some drafts ... I think you make money ...

All good, my treasure. You know, and now I remember What frightened you were in the church at our wedding. Smiles ... well. Îþi will take me smile. He left, leaving me the impression that he wanted to tell me a secret. I had no strength to ask. I had to. Maybe we help in any way. It was the last time when I saw Oswald. Yes, good Gunty. Gunther told that Oswald was assassinated in Cairo in mysterious circumstances. Went. I loved so much ... My soul was filled with remorse that I never got to ask her forgiveness. Hi, Eva. You remain for us a mystery. We are in war, and you open a music store. Yes, I like who enter here, to enjoy a moment of peace. To give little hope. Goodbye. Goodbye, Gunther Thank you that you came. I never noticed how're high. You've beaten me, were a kind of fool when we met. I was in seventh grade, exaggerate. Smells as white roses after rain ... It is a colony water brought by the father. How easy dance, Eva. It's a flake. You did hours of ballet? At school, a few years. I am a little tired. Let's go home. Eva. Lucian go home. - My bad Plaza. - I wandered. I missed you. I made it my life. Nine years of struggle, I have enough. It's time to leave me alone, Tudor. I bring you in mind wherever I go. It hurts every day that I don't live next to you. You expect me to believe you now, After nearly three years of absence? What do you want from me ? I think you need a hot bath. Are you hungry? For you. You must give me my life back. You got it, when I was 16 years. Since then I'm wandering about you, like you're a shadow. This time I'm not letting you go. Lock the door, closed certainly for you, your legs tied. I think it would be better for me, Eva. I don't even know if I love you. Maybe you don't. Doesn't matter anymore. You're mine. Do you understand? Only mine. Lucian, you're? What a surprise. - Hi, Eva. - Wait to see you. You look well in your uniform. You're a real man. Just leaving. Let's go for a walk, to tell me what you have done since I haven't seen you. I called the hospital to find you. They told me that you are improving. Where are they sending you? I volunteered. During training, I was stationed near Campina. Tomorrow I'll go to the front. My unit is somewhere near Iasi. Lucian, be honest with me. What did you do that for ? Had only a year to finish college. Eva... ... I love you. I loved you from the first moment, then the keys when this gentleman is leaving ... When I drove home and I saw that he has returned, I realized that everything is in vain ... Can you not to feel something for me. But I'm keeping you, Lucian. Aren't you my best friend? Yes I am, but it's not enough. I must go, Eve. Parents are expecting to get me to the unit. They came from Constanta to say goodbye. Fair. I want you to come back healthy. Don't be too brave. Good evening. Hi, Peter. Your hand is trembling. What happened ? It would be better to leave quickly. What happened ? They have been a few times in the restaurant, "Seguranja" (secret police) They asked for you, recently. - When was that? - A few weeks ago. - Why you didn't tell me earlier? - I was afraid I have been followed. I saw them watching the restaurant. Why they were looking? Any explanation? What did you said about me? That I have not seen for a few years, that you're abroad And of course, I didn't mention anything about Eve. You're a nice guy, Peter. Greetings to the others. Please, do not want to have problems. Good friend, it would be better to get out from the back door. Everything will be alright. Tudor, go on. Taxi. Tudor ? Tudor, I am! Tudor ? Wakes up yourself. Wakes up yourself. Everywhere moans, cries for help And the crowd is trying to enter the station to look for the missing persons. But the army has raised a protective cord for the rescue troops to work peacefully. I gave up again looking for Tudor. When I saw how stretched the ruins are, I realized that there were too many holes for one man. I learned later that the day of bombing, Gunther was injured by shrapnel and remained without two eyes and Lucian died the front somewhere near Iasi. All the loved ones have left us. Eva, can I sit next to you? You're in great danger. I'd like to help you leaving the country. - Where Tudor? - I don't know. Last time we met three days before his departure. I searched everywhere in the station, Apartments, I have not found ... Maybe he managed to get into another train. Some trains have managed to get out of the station during the bombing. - who you are? - No importance. Tudor asked me to look after you if something happens. Nothing happened. He's alive. Yes, he was also in serious situations, but I promised to take care of you. We must leave immediately. secret police Connection will be, between you and Tudor, sooner or later. Secret police ... Who is he, anyway? Come Eva has no importance. We have to go. - Where are we going? - In America, at Tudor's mother. We will contact there. - But how do we leave the country safely? We are at war. - I have my contacts. The captain of a Turkish vessel will help us. He is paid. Can I go my home and get a few clothes? No, it's better them to think that you disappeared during the bombing. Before the war, Tudor was recruited by American intelligence service. This task isn't familiar to me. We are cousins. My father and mother are brothers Tudor. They were working for the State Department. Why you didn't tell me, why didn't you trust me? It was not a matter of trust. You were safe if he didn't know anything. I suffer every time you leave. Eva, once you have chosen, you must bear also the consequences. In the winter of 1941, Tudor had to leave urgently. I saw running in your car. I had a mission. You must disappear for a while. Did it had any connection with the bombing of Lahovary market? Yes. Oswald ? No, Eve, I did not know that Oswald will be in the car. It was an accident. Let's go. Gestapo killed Oswald. If Tudor is wanted, he could be killed also, then. Then I understood why he hasn't been so. I knew that Oswald worked for German intelligence service supervised by Admiral Canaris. Negotiated secretly with the British services for the surrender of Germans. After his death, an entire network has tried to betray Hitler fell. I loved them both so much. Neither wanted to be involved in things that could have hurt you. Excuse me young mate, take us a picture, please. It's good ? Thanks. I would like to think that I'll meet him soon, entering the door with his smile, as if he had left an hour ago. If not, I hope you will find his peace and that he had, though he sought it, the tranquility they deserve all know. sync bluray © 06.08.2019
