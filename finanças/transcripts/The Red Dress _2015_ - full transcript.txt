[car revving] Rainer! Patricia! [birds chirping] Rainer! Patricia! [gasp] Patricia! Patricia! [panting] [gun shot] Patricia! Patricia! [panting] Put the gun down. It's okay. It's okay. Just put the gun down. Just put the gun down. Wait! Wait! Wait! Hold on! Hold on! As I get further into the temple I hear something. Not sure what it is but I can hear something, and it's... It's the patter of bare feet on stone. So I stay really still and I can hear it getting closer and closer. So I'm getting scared at this point, and then out of the shadows emerged this huge guy; huge sort of thin, wispy hair, and just straight towards me and he says very calmly, "Do our lives shape madness or does the madness shape our lives?" [small scream] Then to make matters worse he then says again very calmly, "My full name..." No. Seriously, it's true. [laughing] So he's looking at me. I'm looking him like that, and... and it's like he can look into my soul and read everything about me. So I'm thinking, "What do I do? What do I do?" Do you know what I did? I did what any self-respecting coward would do. I get the hell out of the temple. I get straight to the airport. On the plane back to London. Get into my bed and cry. [laughing] This is a true story. I can't believe you expect us to believe that you believe this rubbish? [laughing] No, I'm... that is how I perceived the experience. Or a drugged up 20 year old would. Well, it's funny you said that because I have a doctor friend that says experience is experience, be it in dream state or under the influence. I mean, for example, Candice? Yes? What did you dream about last night? I, um, I was driving in Spain. Now was it hot or cold? It was, um, it was hot. It was hot, right but it felt real to you, right? Yeah, of course. Right. Subjective reality. Candice is much freer without her husband around don't you think? Did I overhear you saying you have a conference this weekend? No, it changed, Tuesday. Did you tell me? Yeah, I was explaining the, uh, copyright protection plan I was working on. Remember? You don't want me to leave? You want me to stay? Spend the weekend in a foul mood blaming me for missing it. I can miss one conference. Hmm why mess with your perfect attendance record now. Got it. I'm just saying... Of course, of course. Why don't you, uh, go to bed. Get some rest. I have to clean up. I'll do this. You're exhausted. [dishes clattering] Come here. You're good to me. [sirens] [coughing] [baby crying] [crying] I couldn't get to her. [sobbing] It's okay. [sobbing] [crying] I'm a failure. [crying] Come on. You're not a failure. You've got two choices here. You can drown or you can get through this. We can do that together. Alright? Yeah. Yeah. [sighing] [screaming] Pat? Pat? You know what the psychiatrist said. I'm not taking any pills. It'll stop the nightmares. I don't need them. You need rest, Pat. I'm not taking pills! I'm not talking about the pills. I'm talking about distancing ourselves. Look. It's in Malta. It looks beautiful. Hmm? Reset our lives. What about your work? I'm senior partner, Pat. I'm sure I can take a holiday. James is there. It's a three hour flight home. Will you think about it? ♪ ♪ Thank you. [footsteps] Rainer: Oh wow. Wow. Pat: It's very remote. Rainer: Huh. Don't worry. There's a village not too far away. Come here. Better than advertised, huh? [waves crashing] Thoughts? None. [birds chirping] [car door slams] [birds chirping] Hello, handsome. Oh, God. It's so good to see you. You too! There are cheaper rental cars, you know. Can you see me driving one of those awful match box things? I'm loving the Brits abroad look by the way. Well, it started from a rampant metrosexual. Thank you. You two never change. Hello Patricia. What are you doing here? Oh, I was just in the neighbourhood. Paperwork run. I need some signatures on original documents. Got to close the past before you move on. Kind of a long way to come just for that. Well, I thought I'd take a holiday. You know, kill two birds with one stone. He met an Italian girl. Serious? Serious fun, yeah. You should have brought her. Oh, she's back in Valletta but I bring gifts; figs and olives from Malta. Not bad for a guy who buys everything online. [laughing] Please come inside. Let me make you a cup of coffee. Okay. I'll be in in a minute. Alright. It's great to see you. You too. How have you been? Uh, good. I'm sleeping more. Rainer's been really wonderful to me. He likes being the man. It's his upbringing. So, an Italian girl, huh? You know I can't resist the accent. You know if you ever change your mind, and get lonely you can always come home. I have Rainer. You certainly have and that's something you should hold on to at all costs. What are you suggesting? You guys talk? Little by little. Rainer: So what do you think? It's our new little home. Oh, fabulous. Just don't make it your retirement home. [laugh] Cheers. Say hello to Miss Italy for me. I most certainly will. Oh, by the way how's everything at the office? Yes, good. Do they miss me? Everybody misses you. It's better for Pat here. Did you bring the...? Yeah, it's the bottom of the box. Okay. Pat's doing better. It seems to be working. Good. Oh, um, by the way the police are now thinking that it's arson. Arson? That's what I heard. Well, that's what Tommy heard. Nothing official. What happened? I suppose it started in the lane behind your house. It's probably an insurance scam. Yeah. That's all I know for right now. I'll tell you as soon as I hear more. Keep this between you and I, okay? Yeah, of course. There's no point in getting Pat upset. Hmm. Thank you. Alright. Take care. Patricia: So what did you two talk about? Hmm? You and James by the pool. [sigh] Uh, I dunno, business. I wanted to say hi to the guys. And Candice. Yep. Why, is there something wrong? No just being noisy. Hmm. I should be noisy about what you and James talked about should I? We just talked about Malta. I don't know. We didn't really talk about anything. Did he mention anything to you? Like what? I don't know. About his life? I don't know anything about his life. No. What's this Italian girl like? Oh God. I don't know. They could be married for all I know. He really gets around, huh? Not really. It's all talk. Big shot. Promise me if you don't want to be here anymore you'll tell me. Okay. I just don't want you being here only for me. Same goes for you. [sighing] [screaming] Help! [choking] Somebody! [water lapping at rocks] This tea is bitter. It's natural and good for you. Drink up. Well, it tastes like crap. So does cod liver oil. You know we used to go camping all the time when I was a kid. My mother hated cleaning fish. I can remember this one time. My sister and I watched her for like an hour trying to gut a trout. Yeah, you told me. Did I? Yes, you told me that you and your sister cried for a whole week. It ruined your father's trip. Remember? Rainer? Hello. Do you live here? Oh. You're a little young to be out here on your own. Do you speak English? Okay, I'll take that as a yes. I'm Patricia. What's your name? Oh... hello? [water lapping at rocks] [gasp] Need some help? Hey! What is this for? Just because. It reminds me when we were first married. That was a long time ago. [Phone ringing] Hello James. The minute I got home I received an email on that matter we talked about. It's official. It's arson. Really? The police have been asking a lot of questions. They've brought in a special investigator. Okay. It's shitty. Yeah, I'd like this tied up as quickly as possible, okay? Yeah, you and me both. Problem? Just a botched contract at work. James is working on it. What are you hiding? It's work. I want you to tell me what James said? Don't ask. You know you can't trust him. James is my best friend. He's the only one I can trust. And me? I'm here to protect you, aren't I? That says nothing about trust. I think our relationship is far beyond that. [footsteps] [door slams] [knocking] Candice already left. I know. I came to see you actually. What can I do for you, uh...? Simon. Simon. Um, well to start you... you and I need to have a serious talk. [laugh] This is about Candice? Well and... and you. You'll burn. You should put that sunscreen on. I'm fine. Okay. Hey! Hello! Hey. Mm. Have you met any of our neighbours? Uh... nope. Not yet. But there are people around us, right? [laugh] Oh yeah, there are people around us everywhere, Pat. Don't be condescending. I'm not. What are you asking? I don't know. I'm just; I wanted to ask you that's all. We're only as isolated as you want. Well, is that safe? Why wouldn't it be? I'm here. Hi. Hi, Candice. You just missed him. Damn. I came here on a whim. Well, I'm not sure if he's out to lunch or just picking something up. He might just be at the deli, he'll be five minutes. New dress? Yeah. I just got it. I couldn't resist, I'm bad. You look good. You think so? Hmm. It shows off your body well. I'm just going to wait in his office until he gets back. I feel sick. Is it your stomach? No, it's all over. Here, I got you some more tea. Thanks love. Why don't you put a blanket on? Sweat it out. My mom used to say that all the time. I don't think it ever worked. Well, you just take it easy and drink the tea. You'll feel much better. I hope I'm not coming down with something. You'll be okay in a couple of days, promise.

The red castle? Yes. Not a very happy place. Violent history. One legend among many goes a mother slaughtered her whole family there; six children. So they wouldn't be sold into slavery by pirates. There's a lot of blood been spilled over that castle; in and around it. Probably used by smugglers banking on the horror stories to keep people away. Anyway come back down. Yeah. [leaves crunching] Rainer? Mm. Have I changed? Everybody changes, Pat. No, I mean am I too emotional? Do I dwell on things? We have to learn to let things go. That's such a male answer. Learn how to let go of the baggage. I really want to. That's what I've been trying to tell you. I just miss her. I know. I really wanted you to be happy that I had her. So you wouldn't think I was sitting at home wasting my life. I just wanted to do what my father warned me about. That's all I wanted. Just the family, never wanted friends. It was so much less complicated. I think that's why I let everybody fade away in the last couple of years. You have friends. I have your friends. I met them all through you, people like James. You think about him a lot don't you? Not more than anyone else. I'm just going to wait for him in his office. Why don't you come wait in my office? Not so lonely. Are you sure I won't be disturbing you? Please. You can disturb me anytime. [laugh] You know that dress really is very sexy. Enticing. How am I supposed to respond to that? It wasn't a question.

What do you think I'm lying to you about this, Pat? Huh? Do you think there is some secret I'm withholding from you about this? Do you? No. No, exactly so it's a miscommunication like the doctor said. Do you remember? She didn't say anything about that. My mistake. Don't make this about that. Okay.

There were six of them right here and Angelo was up there. There's nothing here, Pat. Well, maybe he took them. Why would he do that? I don't know. Did you tell him about us?

Tell her that it's beautiful here. Tell her you're drifting further and further away from your husband. That's not fair. When I first met you, you used to tell me everything.

Listen if you want the next time she phones and says, "I've got something to talk about I'll say, "I'm sorry darling you're going to have to phone a shrink." Sorry. No. Has she mentioned anybody else or...? I mean she hinted at something but you know I'm not too sure. Maybe that's why she wanted to talk to me. She felt like she couldn't talk to you.
