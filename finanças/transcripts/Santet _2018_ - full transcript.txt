I need to talk to you about something. Okay. Laura, I think you and the girls should go back to the States. What? Why? With everything that's happening around here, I don't think this is the right place for you and the girls anymore. Rendy, I am not leaving you here by yourself. -Laura, please. -No, Rendy. We're family, okay? We'll stay here till your mom gets better, and then we'll go back home together. This is not a suggestion. I'm telling you to go back. -Why, tell me. -Because I told you so! That's not a good enough answer! This is for your own safety. -For our kids. -Safety from what? What is it you're not telling me? You saw what happened last night? Yeah, I saw her. But, there has to be some kind of rational explanation, right? Laura, please, just listen to me. I'm thinking about you, especially the girls. Yes, the girls are scared, but, they're fine. We've got everything under control. Just let us stay for now, okay? Rendy, I'm not leaving you behind. Rendy, please, you're my husband. Kelly, come on, honey. No! Kelly, baby, oh my god. Mom! What happened? -You okay? -I saw you push her. That woman was gonna hit Kelly! What woman? Is she okay? That woman was gonna. What woman, mom? There was a woman she was gonna hit Kelly. Where? Is your arm okay, honey? Oh, my god. I'm so sorry. Oh, my god. You okay? Let me help. No, I'm okay, I'm okay. Kelly, wait. I'm sorry, okay. I thought that woman was trying to hurt you. I'm so sorry, honey. I would never hurt you on purpose. I, I know. Come on, Kelly. Hey, dad. Hey. What happened to you? Hey, tell me what happened to your arm? I, I fell, dad. But, it doesn't really hurt. What happened, Laura? -Tell him, Mom. -Aliyah! What, you have to tell him. What's going on? He needs to know, mom, tell him. Tell me what? Mom pushed Kelly and she fell. You did what? Can you girls please go upstairs? I need to talk to your dad. You pushed her? I didn't mean to. Maybe I'm seeing things. Maybe I'm going crazy, I don't know, but, now I know what Aliyah is talking about. What do you mean? Look, I didn't wanna say anything before because of everything that's been happening to your mom. What are you talking about? Aliyah, okay. She's been seeing things, and now I'm seeing things. What things? She says she saw your mom last night in her bedroom. That's impossible, Laura. And then today at the supermarket, there was this woman, and she tried to hurt Kelly. But she just wasn't there. Look, Rendy, you have to trust me okay. I know, I sound crazy. But, what is going on? Why is this happening to our family? I don't know what to say to you. Rendy, I am scared, okay! The kids are scared! That's why I told you to go back to America! You know I can't leave you here!

To hurt your family. Santet. What is that? Black magic. Excuse me. Can I help you? Oh, I'm sorry, I just wanted to have a look around. Uh, you are Rendy's wife, aren't you? How did you know? It's a small town. Everyone knows everyone, and Rendy is the only one around here who got married to an American. Of course, I'm Laura. I'm Hendra. I live right down the road, and I work in here. How long has this place been closed? It's around three years ago. So you wanna go inside? -Yeah. -Please. Be careful. So, what brings you here? I was just driving past. I saw my father-in-law's name on the sign. I wanted to see where he used to work. Okay, please. This used to be the biggest factory around here. We had over 600 workers, and Ms. Amber used to run this place. Who's Ms. Amber? She was the manager. Mr. Dharma's favorite employee. They were very close. He trusts her with everything. But, one day she just stop coming to work. What happened to her? Some said, she ran away with her boyfriend. Some said, she found a better job in Jakarta, who knows? But, she never came back, and not long after that Mr. Dharma started getting sicker and sicker, and, well, nobody took care of the factory because Ms. Amber was no longer here. Go see. Here. Oh, that's Ms. Amber and Mr. Dharma. Mrs. Laura, are you okay? I'm sorry. I've got to go. What happened to you? Fatma, I'm hungry, could you make me something? Can I help you with something, Kelly? Fatma. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to come into your room It's okay, what did you need? I was just a little hungry I'll make you something. Thanks. Is that you in the photo? Oh! That's my mother, and that's me when I was eight years old. Wow, you look exactly like your mother. Come on, let's make you something. Okay. Aliyah, where is your mom? I don't know, dad. Okay. Kelly, where is your mom? I don't know, but, she said she wants to run some errands. Hey, I've been calling you. Why didn't you pick up the phone? Fatma, could you please leave us? Of course, ma'am. What's wrong? Why didn't you tell me what happened to your mother? What do you mean? I went to the hospital today. She tried to kill herself, and you didn't tell me. You went to the hospital? Yeah. Why? Why didn't you tell me? Oh, so now you're angry at me for going to the hospital? You should have asked me first, Laura. Why? So you can keep lying to me, making me fell that everything's okay when it's not. I didn't lie to you. I just didn't want you to worry, okay! Who is Amber? What did you say? Who is Amber? Answer me! She's nobody. You're lying. What do you want me to say? The truth! What does it matter? Because I think she has everything to do with what's been going on in this house. Are you serious? Where are you getting all these crazy ideas from? I saw her here, Rendy! She tried to hurt me. She tried to hurt our kids. Okay, so now you're just going crazy! I went to your dad's factory today. I saw her picture on the wall. She used to work for your dad. So, don't you tell me you don't know who she is. And the guy that worked there, he said that one day she stopped showing up for work and nobody knew why. Why, Rendy? What happened to her? I think you know what happened to her. I don't know what the hell you are talking about. I don't know who she is, and I don't wanna hear anything about this ever again. You hear me! No, you're not walking away this time. I know you're hiding something from me. Who is Amber, why is she trying to hurt us? Why do I keep on seeing her everywhere? I'm seeing her everywhere! You can't see her because she's dead.
