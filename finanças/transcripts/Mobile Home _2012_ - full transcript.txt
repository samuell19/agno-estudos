-Hey. -Hi, Luc. -Hello. -Give me a minute. -OK. -You're going out? -We'll get a drink. I thought you wanted to go to the park tomorrow. I will go. -How are you? -Good. Good night. You'll tell me how it ends. We'll see about that. -Are you coming? -Yes. Wait, you're going too fast. Watch out, don't fool around. Fuck! Mum, you're unbelievable. -You'll be knackered tomorrow. -I know, but... You know, but you keep on doing this. Go to bed, Mum. Go to bed, OK? I'll hem your trousers. You'll what? -I will hem your trousers. -But Mum... Some people would like to sleep. Mum, it is 5 in the morning. -I'm awake now. -But I'm going to bed. Mum. My mother keeps on talking about you, it's crazy. -So how are you? -I'm good. I'm OK, and you? This does me a lot of good. I mean, the countryside is... I know my furniture is at your place, but I haven't sorted it out yet. Once I get a van, I'll pick it up. I just need to find time. I'll come. -Should we walk? -I'm going to go. What? Sylvie. I don't know why I came, I'm in idiot. You're not. I'm happy to see you. You're distant. You're not with me. Well, I'm distant... It's not like it used to be, I can't hold you. I'm not asking you to. You just left and we didn't even try. We tried a lot of times. We did try a lot of times. We broke up so many times, it was... We tried, but we didn't manage to... If we were meant to be together, it wouldn't be so hard. I'm not good at being a couple, that's it. Sylvie. I missed you too, Caroline. Can I kiss you to celebrate? You can. Hey, Julien. I'm good, I'm just taking a break. So, what have you decided? Remember that at first, I wanted to extend this wall? But actually, I'm going to break it down to make a big loft with a spiral staircase leading upstairs. Do you have some news about the roof? Not yet. One thing at a time. It could be nice. Yes, it could be nice. Dad, you have some soup and meat left for tonight. It's a shame to stop on the first day. Dad, I'll be back tomorrow. See you tomorrow, then. See you. Remember our summer tour? We did three dates. It was a small tour. We left and Vincent came to see us in this small village. He was so pissed. He came on stage and threw up on a guy at the front. It was Bourmesse, right? I was so mad at you all for chickening out back then. We were all meant to leave after college, but it never came up again. You were all coupled up, it was done. And if we had left, I would have had to rush back. Why don't we leave now? Why don't we hit the road in a van now? I'm not kidding. We can buy a van to sleep in and just leave. When we need to make some money, we get seasonal jobs, physical and tangible jobs, out in the open. When we're sick of it, we hit the road again. We just travel. Can you imagine? Can you? Most people would dream of that but are stuck. We are lucky to have no strings and we don't even take advantage of it. Well, no strings... You father is fine now, he's cured, right? He is. Supposedly. I've started the barn. Honestly, Julien. I don't know, but this barn thing... It's a huge amount of work. It will take your three years and you're on your own. Moscow! Wait. Where is St. Petersburg? If we want to go, it has to be before Moscow. We need to go through... Lithuania. Isn't Iceland around here? I've heard it's gorgeous. Iceland is far. We might as well go to Greenland. Greenland? Let's check it out. Back already? What are you doing? Nothing, we're looking. -I'm making coffee. -Thank you, Luc. Thanks, Dad. Look at Sardinia. I've seen a documentary about the coast. -It looks beautiful. -It's a long way. -Go check it. -I'm on it. There. When would you leave? I don't know. As soon as we're ready. Really? I thought the barn was important to you. Dad... It's too heavy. It will take 3 years and I'm alone. But that's what you wanted. Are you under his influence? I'm not. He's arrived and you've changed. But Dad. You're better now, aren't you? I will get to work, earn a living and travel at the same time. It's great, isn't it? It is. It has no window. This one was 6000. It is something, and it has its limits. No, this is too much. For just twice the amount, it is an amazing deal. We can check the prices together. -But still. -Wait. If you want to go far for a long time, this is what you need. It's pretty good. Too expensive. Let's check it out. Come on. Come on in. Look at that massive fridge. I won't have much left. This will save us loads. We have a shower and a toilet, no need to go to a hotel. We can cook, no need to go to a restaurant. We won't need anything. It's great. But we need work, and fast. I know. It's not a problem. And we have TV. Have you seen the size of the mattresses? I can picture us. You drive and I lie there, watching out the window, chilling, and bang, bang... What an ass. We're thinking of travelling from city to city and stop when we need money. We will ask farmers if they need help with picking grapes, potatoes or beetroot. However, to get started, we need financing, but since you gave Sophie and I some money, I could use it... The money we gave Sophie and him is to help them settle down. It's not for a holiday. Dad, this isn't a holiday. I'm leaving to work, so... Do you know how seasonal jobs are like? Yes, I do. You're going to pick plums and potatoes when you can't even do it here? You can't compare, this is about travelling. It's not like here. You should think about it. He will use that money when he settles down. I don't want to settle down. -Do you realise? -I do realise. I stayed with someone for long, I already worked, and it is not what I want, that's all. Did you give it to me or not? We gave it to you for housing. -Then I'll give it back. -No. If I can't use the money you gave me, what's the point? I know someone who will find a use to it. I wanted to set up a veranda. Stop it. I'll transfer the money for your veranda and a second tower on your castle thing. -Stop it now. -It's going to be nice. You're taking a ball and tennis rackets? Yes, maybe. Don't take it all, we'll bring it to your apartment. -It will be done. -How are you going to carry it? Don't worry, Mum. I'll be fine. Why can't we drive you to the station? Because I need to say bye to Julien. Are you running off because of your dad? He's not running off, he's out to get a job. We're not throwing you out. Mum, I know that. You OK? All right, take this. I'll take that. And the guitar. Do you know who he's staying at? No, I don't know them. -Is he mad at us? -No. -Hey, Simon. -Not this one. What an ass! Imagine being parked on a deserted coastline. You can see the sun-red sea by the window and hear nothing but the waves. Then we drive down the coast. You drive and I sleep. And... -What's that? -We're out of here. -It's a Dutch van. -You're the Dutch. No toilet paper needed, you can poo in the shower. Stop it! Have a drink. You have hot water? Yes, we even have a radiator in the bathroom. We can go to cold countries. Where did you get the money? It's a family thing. You have to get on fine here. Let's toast to... Our new life. Cheers, St√©phane. Cheers. Do you have a bed? You're going to have fun and then what? What happens when you get back? Who said we would go back? You're becoming nomads. -Why not? -Yes, why not? -You find it all here. -What a dick. I don't know, but you won't... Move on that way. Listen to you, you sound like Dad. I think it's great, you don't have to meet the standard. I didn't say that. -We can do different than you. -Don't attack me. I'm not, but we try to scare people who want to be different. They're taking risks and I think it's cool. It's easy with Daddy's money. Your parents didn't help you build the house? It's different. It's good to know where you're heading. -Where are you heading? -Stop it now. To your ass. Wait up. What's up? Can you drop me off? I don't want to sleep here. Of course. Thanks. -Where does your friend live? -By the church. No problem. One last drink? She said to me: "You're leaving, we won't see each other again, we might as well enjoy it while we can". She's very mature for her age. And have you seen her breasts? No kidding. What? -Come on. -It's a discount. -No, but look. -At the beach. OK, give it. It's the last time. -It's a pack. -Yes but... -That's enough. -Promise. Her breasts are dope. She has massive breasts, but they are firm like small ones, so... Should I get a grill? To grill stuff. I know, but it's a discount. What are you gonna do with this? We can be loaded with this. My cousin uses it in Spain, he found loads of coins. How much? 149 euros. -No. -Instead of 250. Still no. -Simon. -No. Fuck, it's my parents. Did you hear me? Julien, it's my fucking parents. Don't worry. It's OK, I don't think they've seen me. Fuck, hide! Put that in front of your face. -Am I good? -Simon. Watch out. My stuff. We're fine. They're gone now. -We're good! -You scared me. Fuck, they're following us. It's ridiculous, they've seen us. They'll let us go. At the end, we take a left, I'll pretend I know my way. -It's ridiculous. -Don't worry. -Can we turn? -Not here. -We can. -Where to? I don't know, but we're turning. -He's going to follow us. -He won't. The mud will scare him off. He won't let us go. We'll find another road at the end. We can't take your father to Norway. Norway is a long way. We can't go further. How much for this? It's a great bargain. How much? Not much. Some people save up all their life to buy this. It's cheap. Did you push him into this? No, I... -Did you share the expenses? -I pay him back as we go. Do you know how long you have to work to pay that back? You need to pick shitloads of apples and plums. It's ridiculous to buy this at this age. It's pathetic. You wanted me to buy a house, so... -Come, Monique. -But wait. Why didn't you tell us? I was about to. -You were running away. -No, I wasn't. -Monique. -Go, Mum. Come on! There's no point talking. You don't realise how bad this is. Come, come. Stop. You can't, stop! We're done. -Here. -Thanks. Why the hell did you drive on a muddy trail? It's not motocross. How much will it cost? For this part? Probably 2000 or 3000. That's the downside of these vehicles. A problem and you cough up. It's best to avoid these pieces of junk. Come to my office. Excuse me, where are you leaving the RV? Outside. I live in it. I have nowhere to sleep so I'd like to stay here. If you don't mind. I don't have 3000 euros. Maybe it will be less. A garage never gives you good surprises. And we need a bit on the side. If we have to come back in two weeks, forget it. Some would be so happy... Hello, we're looking for Mathieu. -Thank you, Val√©rie. -No more sausages. -That's OK. -Hello. -Val√©rie, Julien, Simon. -Nice to meet you. We went to the same school. They're looking for a job. OK. But I don't need much help. I was told you left with a caravan. We still need some money. It's not a caravan. Maybe you can make root balls. It's tedious, but you get paid per piece. Strong guys get away with it. You need skills for the rest. Will it do? Yes. Can you start tomorrow? OK for tomorrow. Great. If someone told me I would give you a job... -Are you eating with us? -No, thanks. -Are you sure? -Yes. -It smells nice. -Yeah, right? OK, well... You can sleep at home. The trip has started. It's simpler to get to work together in the morning. OK, then. Have a nice trip. Thanks. -Come on, let's go to work. -I'm coming. Spread the branches open, lean on the tree and hit hard. Be careful of the root. And turn. You twins don't wear a tie? A big root. There you go. If you work well, you can do 30 an hour. Do all the red ones. Sorry. Here. Great. How many did you get? I don't know, I didn't... -Ten? -No, more than that. You did seven. I didn't. I counted. You counted? Mine were big so of course I did less. You'll get less than minimum wage. It's just a question of technique. -Technique? -Yes. And strength too. Come on, laugh. You won't be able to jerk off, that's all. Guys... I'll go food shopping, I guess. See you later. What happened? Why don't you come visit? Calm down, I'll explain. Let's have a coffee. Are you really happy? I haven't felt like that in years. Years. You should come over. Mum, I left. Yeah, well... Come and talk to your dad. Tell Dad I swear to pay him back. It's not the point. So what is? I have nothing more to say. I'm happy, I feel good. What can I do if he thinks it sucks? OK then. Should I take your laundry? I've already left. Julien. What? Should we go? I'm up and running. Ouch! -You OK? -Yes. -286. -Sorry? -286. -Don't worry, you're starting. -Don't start. -It's a good number. -Don't let Raph walk over you. -You have the technique. He's a champ at that. -I have other plans. -See you Monday. You let Raph walk over you. That t-shirt! -Hurry up. -I landed 843. I can land another one if you want. What a drag. Add 50 and I can handle you behind the curtains. -I doubt you can. -Don't be so demanding. Go to the whores, you'll feel better. It's all yours. -I don't mind the money. -You don't? Get out of here. -You OK? -Yes. 416. -Not bad for a first time. -You type really fast. It's not bad. At some point, it will close up. I've seen it. -Don't worry about me. -You got a dildo? You have a dildo. How are you, Mounir? There are flies around. 892. See you Monday. Kiss your dildo for me. I haven't felt that in such a long time. A real good fatigue. What do you think of Val√©rie? Do you like her? What? Val√©rie, the secretary. Isn't she fine? Don't you like her? She's a bit old. Old women have experience. I'm sure she's... What did you say? I said I'm sure she's a whore in bed. Julien... Julien, land your big fork. Come on, dig out my bush. Julien's big tree. -I like that. -Mummy loves it. -It's done, guys. -Great, thanks. Simon, it's done. Thank you, G√©rard. 1950, right? Thank you, G√©rard. Don't leave before the second payment. Or I'll go to your parents. Don't you worry. Excuse me. Hello, Dad. OK, bye. Honey, we're off? I need to drop by my dad's first. -Come on, Julien. -It won't be long. It's unplugged, Dad. It says "no signal". It doesn't say "unplugged". You should have told me, I would have explained. You can print now. I'll eat first. You can eat here if you want. You go ahead. Go. Off we go! Hop in. Sorry, but I think I'm staying for lunch. Oh, no. He's insisting. Don't wait for me, go for a ride. Yes I will. It won't take long. I've got wine if you want. Dad. I'm allowed one drink with food. Don't make me watch you. I didn't have any. I knew you would come by this weekend. I have the check-up results. Yes of course. So? Apparently, I'm fine. Apparently? I don't know. Do you feel stuff or what? I'm not sure. Your exams are clear, right? So they say. What does that mean? Remember Aunt Lise. She was fine and two weeks later she got buried. Stop with that. It was three months later and that was ten years ago. Medicine made progress. You should stop with that. It's been just five years. What? Nothing. If they said you were fine, you are. Just a small one. Cheers. -You're pissed off. -There's just one drop. -I waited all afternoon. -I know. -Why don't you answer your phone? -Hi, Julien. Hi. -How are you? -Good. Let's go. What did you do? We went for a ride, it was nice. Don't move and drop your toasts, RoboCop. I surrender. -You want war. -I don't. -You do. -I don't. -All hide. -Toasts! You promised. Oh come on. -You made a promise. -Yes, but... Please. It is so beautiful. Thanks. Thank you. Whose is it? -It's mine. -No. It's when I had a band with St√©phane and Julien. It was our first song. And the last. But why? When we started composing, we had to go to college so we saw each other less and we ended up stopping. The classic story. It's too bad, you have an amazing voice. A lot of bands will never write a song like that. You do it right off the bat and you quit. It's too bad. Are you going to see her before leaving? No, I'm not meant to. Let's stop playing and watch the end of the game. -Play. -It's almost over. Come on, I'm kicking... But you always play with your dad, you're doped. Hi. Maya? You're soaking wet. What are you doing here? My mum dropped me at the station but I didn't take my train. It's just prep classes, I don't need it. -Are you sure? -It's no big deal. Can I stay? What are you going to do? We'll be working and stuff. I can tidy up and cook. -You cook? -I'm a great cook. Why don't you call Val√©rie? She's single. I don't know her. So? Worst case scenario, she blows you off. We're out of here soon. I don't know. I'm not sure I want to. If she was in your bed, you wouldn't sleep elsewhere. She has enough to snack on. Rabbit with prunes tonight. I hope she got it right. I'm very demanding with rabbit and prunes. My mother's was excellent. You can't imagine. All right, I'm on fire. -Five more minutes. -No, come on. Time to go. See you tomorrow. I'm starving. Maya? What's wrong? Tell me. Val√©rie. -You OK? -Yes. I don't know what you're up to, but if you were off for a drink, I... Thanks, but I have to pick up my kid. OK. I'm saying it, just in case. You can come and eat at my place. I don't want to intrude. -I'm asking you, so... -No. -If you don't want to... -I do. So what should we do? Are you coming or following me? OK. -Are you following? -Yes. Great! -See you, then. -See you. -See you. -Yep. For someone who wasn't really hungry... But it's delicious. Thank you. What were you doing before this project? Well, I did stuff. I did loads of stuff. I mostly took care of my father. He was really ill and needed treatment. But he's better now. -It's brave. -What is? Taking care of your father. -Not everyone would do it. -It's normal. He's all alone. So I thought I could maybe think of myself. I understand. What about you? You're not from around here. No, I'm not. I don't know anyone here, but I was looking for peace and quiet. What's wrong, sweetie? You had a nightmare? A story? -I'll be right back. -Of course. "From far far away, from the end of the world, the smell of tasty meals came to him. Max gave up on becoming the king of the Wild Things. He sailed away again, in the morning and in the evening. Days stretched like weeks and weeks like months. But after one year and one day, in the middle of the night, he finally came alongside his own room where his dinner was waiting for him. All warm." Where were you? At Val√©rie's. Did you go for it? No. I think I could have, but I just didn't. What's wrong with her? I don't know, but she's not OK. I won't go to work tomorrow and I'll drive her back to uni. It's probably for the best. It's just the way it is. -You OK? -Play something for me. If you want. Blues? You seem fine, brother Tonight was under the cover I said I didn't. This is what I see And I see a happy guy I would tell you if I did. You got red cheeks And shiny eyes Back from old Val√©rie All lovey-dovey Julio is better than Iglesias You've got so much class -Classy at Val√©rie -What an ass. -We should... -I'm so sick of overthinking. It's not what life is about. You need to live in the moment. And... That's what you and Julien are doing. You live in the moment. I think it would be great if I could travel with you for a while. It's exactly what I need. I need to... I have money, I can take care of myself. That's not the problem. But what would you do with us on the road? The same as you. Meaning? Meaning... Take time, enjoy what's there. Take time to understand who I am and what I want. Julien and I know who we are. We know what we want, you know? Do you understand? And the other thing is that we don't have the same age, you and I. There's so kind of gap... I'm not sure we're in the same place. But Maya! I felt good with you. I never felt so close to anyone. Wait, listen. Fuck! I'm going to run some errands, OK? -Right now? -I can't do it anymore. I need a break and we need food anyway. Laters. -Curly is tired? -Shut up. Simon? -How are you? -Good. -It's been a while. -Indeed. Also visiting your parents? Right. How are you? I'm really great. I had some great parts and I have just finished a movie shoot. -It's a project... -Charlotte. This is Ga√´tan. -Hi. Simon. -Nice to meet you. Let's go soon, beautiful. OK. So I've just finished shooting a movie for cinema. I had the main lead, it's crazy. It was amazing. What about you? I'm doing great. Really really good. OK. Do you still work at Li√®ge? No, I'm done with Li√®ge. I play music, actually. I picked it up again, I'm way into it. I write songs to make up an album, that's my goal. Is it going OK? It's going great. I'm really happy. Are you still with... Sylvie? No, it's over. -I'm sorry. -That's OK. Come on, of course I'm fine. I'm really good. Guess who I just saw? Charlotte Feller. She's so hot now, seriously. -Not really. -Come on, she is. No, really. -Did you know she was pregnant? -I was told. Her boyfriend is loaded, he's some kind of trader. OK, I get it now. It helps. Last time I saw her, she seemed to be in love. Yeah, right. Come on. -I would bang her too. -It's not that. It has nothing to do with that. She's not as beautiful as she used to be. I don't care anyway. People who are constantly happy are weird. They hide something. Can I borrow your polo shirt? Why? I'm going to the movies. Who with? I'm going with... It's Val√©rie, right? -She asked me, so... -You never tell me anything. I'm telling you now. What, you want to come with us? I'll come to shag her too. I'm just going to the movies. Right, the movies. -Are you going to be OK? -Yeah. I can stay if you want. It doesn't matter. I'd like that. I'd like you to stay. Just go! OK, I'm off. To the movies. Bye. What did you think of the movie? Well, I found it... I didn't like it much. Me neither. I'd like a drink, but the baby sitter is done. OK then. See you. You don't want to come? Yes I do. I didn't want to... I'm just asking, you know. OK, yes. Are you... Following me? Simon? We're going to be late. Shit, I just went to bed. What an idiot. I played music all night. So you're not going to work? Music is my thing, really. Why did I give it up? It's my thing. I wrote an amazing song. I honestly think it's really cool. I called St√©phane this morning, we can rehearse. We'll play together again. I'm so happy. So you don't want to leave anymore? Are you crazy? You bet I want to leave. We write on the road and play in the streets. We can do that. That's what it is. This trip is about daring. We'll dare loads of things. By the way, since I'm into it right now and I have inspiration, I'm going to skip work for two days to keep going. Do you mind working by yourself? No, I'm fine. Really? Cool. I'm going to bed, I'm pissed. How was Val√©rie? It was nice. Nice. -How nice? -I'll tell you about it. You'd better. But you look just fine. Hey, guys. Let's start, guys? Let me show you. I know, I don't have lyrics yet. I'm mumbling for now. Then you have the chorus. It's a bit different. Like this. This is it. That's the idea. There's something. It's sweet. What? No, it's nice. Simon, remember this? Listen. It feels good, right? Remember? Come on, Simon! No, it sucks. No, minor! No, come on. For fuck's sake. Your home is coming. What's wrong? Let's go. Let's leave. -What, when? -Now. We should have left 15 days ago and we're still here. I can't stand it anymore. -We don't have enough savings. -Yes we do. We can fix the van and find work anywhere. Grape-picking in France. We can manage, come with me. Weren't you writing? Of course I'm writing. All the time. But I can write anywhere. The point is to leave whenever. If you ever get sick of a place, I'll be on your side. I just need some time to say goodbye to my dad and... He knows, we should have left already. -It's not that simple. -Yes it is! We just leave. You hop in the van and we leave, it's that simple. Your dad is not sick anymore, don't treat him like a kid. Just live your own life. You have no idea what we went through, so shut up. Just leave me the weekend. Give me time, OK? I'm sorry. Sorry. Monday. Fine, Monday. Are you OK? You still got the key? Yes. Give it back to me later. You've got a van? More or less. -Are you by yourself? -Yes. How are you going to carry all this? I'll manage. Do you have boxes then? -Shit, I don't. -Simon. Don't worry, I'll be fine. Wanna go for a drink? I don't think so. I'd like to talk to you. About what? I don't know. -To see if you're fine. -I am. I'm going to work. Can we at least talk? Why are you being violent and aggressive? I'm not aggressive. I've been waiting for weeks and you never answered my texts. -Sorry, I have things to do. -You show up and I have to... I wanted to see you. You decided not to see me anymore. -I did not decide that. -Right, you didn't. You haven't decided, since you never do. You're incapable of making decisions. I just want you to pack your stuff and get out. You can keep my stuff. I don't want to. I don't want to see it, OK? Sell it, give it away or burn it. Do whatever. I don't need it anyway. -Don't go without it. -I'm leaving, OK? -Where to? -Far. You might never see me again. Wait! Simon? -Here you are. -How are you? What's wrong? Nothing. I came to drop something. I'm in a hurry, I'll see you later. -What's the matter? -Nothing, I'm fine. -I'm fine. -No, you're not. I'm in a hurry, Mum. -What is it? -I'll see you later. See you Monday. -No, we're off. -Already? Yes, we're off. -How are you? -Good, and you? It's 726. What are you doing this weekend? So you're leaving on Monday? Yes. That's why I thought we should... You know. See each other? Right. -Here. -Thanks. Do you want to come by tomorrow? Yes. Dad? Get down. Come on down. Dad, come down! What is wrong with you? Why do you do this? I do it for you. I can play and I can put two cards. I didn't know we could do that. Do you know which country you're doing first? France, I think. And then? I don't know. We'll see. Do you want more Coke? I'm fine. Green. Fuck. No, I won't leave all that in front of my house. Let him do it. Look, he's coming. Let go. Leave it to him. What are you doing? He's going to take care of it. Why is Sylvie's father dealing with this? -Where will we put it? -Nowhere, I'll handle it. -To do what? -I'll handle it. Let him. Get in, Mum. Please don't stay here. Don't stay here. Let him handle it by himself. Mum, get in. Stop it! It's all good now. I don't give a shit about this. -He's breaking everything. -It's all right. What's that? "FESTIVE". I'll be back. -What's all this? -We'll sell it in France. -We need to leave, Julien. -Tomorrow morning. We need to leave now or I'll lose it. I'll lose it if I stay one more minute here. Honestly. One night ahead is not much. Please, do it for me. Please. Speak. You want me to drive you back ? What will we do? What will we find? I don't know. I don't know. Well... See you. See you. -Can I come in? -Of course. I wanted to say goodbye. I'm leaving and I wanted to say goodbye. That's all. I'm back on the road. SUBTITLING: RED BEE MEDIA FRANCE
