Hello. Whatever you're doing isn't right. Please go back right now. You'll suffer the consequences. S**t! S**t! S**t! S**t! You have no idea what you're about to do. You can't run away from us. Accept your fate. I've told you before. I'm telling you again. Why don't you get it? You can't escape us. Listen to what I'm telling you. Go back. Ahead of you... Shut up! How much do you want? Fill this up. Keep this. The Muslim ghost. The fishy ghost. The widow ghost. And last but not the least the benevolent ghost. All these supernatural elements are an integral part of Bengali literature. -Hmm. -Hmm. We have all grown on these ghost stories. When I was a kid, my granny told me a ghost story. -I came down with fever I was so scared. -Hmm. I still get goosebumps thinking about it. And kids these days... They know about vampires and zombies but nothing about the local legends. What's your point? Halloween is coming up. Hmm? There are going to be lots of parties. Kids are going to be dressing up in costumes. But no one is going to dress up as a Bengali ghost. They'll dress up as a witch but not a local one. -Right? -Hmm... So... I was thinking, for our special issue on Halloween... Let's do a story... that introduces the present generation with our supernatural legends. Hmm... It should revive the ghost stories hiding in the nooks and corners of Bengal. -Hmm but these characters-- -Hold on a minute. These characters are already obsolete. And no matter what you say, no one reads Bengali ghost stories anymore. We must revive them because they have become obsolete. Right? What do you think, Soumen? What's the point of digging up obsolete ghosts? -Why spread superstition? -This is not superstition! Take any country in the world. The supernatural elements are a core part of the culture of any country. They have preserved their ghost stories. Haven't forgotten them. Take Japan or America for example. If this is superstition then Durga festival is superstition too. I don't fast or wear new clothes on the festival because God would curse me. But because my grandpa taught me as a kid. I have a lot of memories attached to it. When I have kids of my own and they grow up... I will take them too. Just like that the Bengali legends of ghosts and spirits... It's our duty to make them relevant again. Isn't it? Hmm. I really think he has a point. Hey, you're not making any sense. You're being emotional for no reason. No more arguments. We're doing the story. -Hmm? -Hmm. You'll take the lead. Soumen, find out about the famous haunted houses in Kolkata. And Sayantika... look for an interesting perspective to write about. A new angle. So that it increases our youth connect. Think about it. Do you want to say something? No, it's okay. Is everything clear? Aren't you ashamed of yourself? Three prospective grooms rejected you. And you don't seem to care. It's our fault that we allowed you to work. We may have been relieved if you found someone on your own. You've not been able to do it either. How long do you plan to torture your parents? And I've asked you to go to the parlour once a week. What kind of a haircut is this? Your dad is very angry with you after he saw your photo. Mom, can you... please give the phone to Dad? He doesn't want to talk to you. Please stop bothering us... Mom, please... Hello? The subscriber you're trying to reach is busy. What happened? What's bothering you? Why did you ask Tanusree to lead the project? I don't take these decisions. The boss decided. The boss has considered her for the sub-editor post. It'll be official soon. You know very well that I deserve that post more. Baby, it doesn't matter, what I know and what I think of you. What matters is what the boss wants. And to be fair, Tanusree is quite talented. She is. And you have a lot of problems too. You're late every day. You hide in every board meeting. You don't speak up. You got to have an individual voice. You have to figure things out. Don't lecture me. -This story is the boss's fantasy. -Yes. So, he's deeply focused into it. No point wasting time feeling demotivated and demoralized. Do a fantastic job. You never know, the tables can turn any time. Uh hmm... Hmm... Damn it! Nothing is coming to my mind. What am I going write? S**t! This is... Rubbish! Hello. Have you forwarded an email with a link to a prank site? Nope. What kind of a site? I don't know, dude. I've received a strange email in my inbox. There are a lot supernatural stuff here. A dead Brit's coat. Taranath Tantric's loincloth. "Aghora" holy man's skull. An online shopping site for supernatural objects? Yes. Seriously? I think someone is kidding. Halloween is right around the corner. It's an interesting concept. Hmm. You can write about it. Do one thing. Buy something from there. Are you crazy? I'm a 100% sure it's a fake website. Waste of money. Why don't you buy something and check? The company will reimburse you. So, don't worry about that. What should I buy? Wait. Let me see. Umm... No, no, no... Dude! Can't believe this. Hundred percent authentic "Brohmodoityo", the benevolent ghost, for sale. Three hundred and fifty years old. Prime condition. Weighs 65 kilos. Stock clearance. Ninety percent off. It costs Rs. 999. We can pay cash on delivery. Should I get it? Interesting! Buy it! Hey, I want my money back. You'll get it. Forward the site link to me. Okay. Bye. Hmm... Authentic "Brohmodoityo"! (indistinct chatter) Can I play with you? Ashish, can she? -Yes, she can. -She can join us. Make sure the blindfold is tight. Hmm. Hmm... Check if it's alright. -Hmm... -Is it? -Yes. -Now let's spin her around. -Which way? -No, no... This way. -Let's go. -Yeah. -Blind man, blind man, catch us if you can. -Blind man, blind man, catch us if you can. -Blind man, blind man, catch us if you can. -Let's get out of here. -Blind man, blind man, catch us if you can. -Blind man, blind man, catch us if you can. Hello. Hello! Why are you calling me? You have the keys. I can't come today, ma'am. My son is unwell. If you keep taking leaves... I'll come in early tomorrow. Hang up. Same news. -Ms. Sayantika Mukherjee? -Yes. There's a package for you. -Oh, yes! Right! -It's here, ma'am. -So soon? -Our delivery is really fast. Oh! Please come in. Bring that in. Be careful. Ma'am, can you show me where the south of the house is? Why? Ma'am, I think it's that side. Then we'll have to move the TV. The TV... -But why? -We have to place this. The south corner is ideal. No, no. Please don't move anything. Just keep the trunk in the centre. Ma'am, it's very heavy. It'd be impossible for you to move it later. Is this like feng shui? And I don't believe in all this. Just position it in the centre. I'll figure it out later. Okay, ma'am. Ultimately, it's your choice. -Bring it in. -Put it there. This is the instruction manual. Before you open the trunk, please read it carefully. It's written in Sanskrit. The audiobook is loaded in the music player. You can just listen to that. But ma'am, please be very careful. Please don't disobey the instructions in the manual. Hmm... Well, can I speak to someone from the management? I'm doing a story for Halloween. So, it would help me with the coverage. Umm... No, ma'am. We don't want any publicity. Sorry. It's against our policy to interact with the media. Oh! -Ma'am, one more thing. -Yes? Please be very careful. Because you're going to deal with a very powerful supernatural entity. -So, please be very careful. -Sure. Thank you. Huh! Whatever! Good morning, Ms.Mukherjee. Welcome to chapter one of the "Brohmodoityo" user guide. You're now the owner of a rare, supernatural entity at a very good price. That's why, we congratulate you. Let me introduce you to the "Brohmodoityo" starter pack. You've been given a special chemical. It's been made with cobra's venom, human ribs and ashes from ritual. Before you open the trunk delivered to you... use the chemical to draw a protective circle around the trunk. Imagine that this is a bird's cage. The moment you open the trunk, "Brohmodoityo" inside will be released. You have bought him, that's for sure... but if you want the rightful ownership... you have to find out his name. "Brohmodoityo" is a very powerful spirit. It's very difficult to control him. He won't tell you his real name very easily. So, until you can earn his trust and find out his real name... it's very important to keep the trunk within the protective circle. The "Brohmodoityo" will be weak as long as he's inside the circle. What the hell! He'll able to move around your entire house. But he won't be able to harm you in any way. Put the trunk in a place from where you don't have to move it often. It's really heavy. Because once the protective circle is broken it won't work anymore. I hope you've found a suitable, permanent place for the trunk. Now, draw the protective circle carefully. The maid is not coming in today and I'm making a mess. "Brohmodoityo" is used to living on banyan trees. If the banyan tree is in front of him he'll feel at home. It's difficult to adjust to a new place. Keep the bonsai plant near the trunk. This... This is heavy too. That's it! Now you're ready to welcome "Brohmodoityo" into your life. Open the trunk and release him. What the... Holy strings? Fake stuff! "Brohmodoityo", my foot! What a waste of time! Nonsense! Uh huh! Nothing to get upset about. "Brohmodoityo" are shy by nature. He likes privacy. He's not social like the fishy ghost. He won't appear in front of you so easily. And him suddenly appearing in front of you, is certainly not good for your heart. Relax! There's a way to test if the 'Brohmodoityo' is really in your house. You just need a lemon. Lemon? Put the lemon on the trunk. If there's a 'Brohmodoityo' at your place... What the... The lemon will turn red in a few moments. Try it. I don't have any lemons. I have an apple. No problem. Although we insist on lemons... But this test can be done with any fruit. Hey, who are you? Can you see me? In this manual, we've tried to give the very detailed instructions. But it's not interactive. Don't waste your time by trying to talk to it. Hello. Where are you? Late again? I'm on my way. In the lift. Idiot! How many lifts are there in the office? No, no, it's okay. I'm in the lift too. Coming... Damn it! I'm going to be late again. -Hi! -What's up? -When are you going to Soumen's party? -Soumen's party? Oh, sorry! That was last week. Got things mixed up. Anyway, how's your work? -Didn't you get it? -No. When did you send it? Very strange! Hope you weren't dreaming. No, not at all. I ordered a 'Brohmodoityo' like you said. They delivered a trunk in the morning. And a manual. Then you probably were right. It must have been a prank site. Anyway, I need to get back to work. Oh gosh! Huh? What the-- It's rotten in half a day... How is it... Welcome to chapter two of the 'Brohmodoityo' user guide. 'Brohmodoityo' is an angry and moody spirit. If his mental and physical state is not stable... can be injurious to your health. So, the 'Brohmodoityo' must be given a proper diet at least once a day. Ideally, he should be given a living being to eat. He prefers humans but if it's difficult to procure... you can give him pigeon, chicken etc. Don't try to feed him rats or cockroaches. The consequences would be really bad. Living beings or humans? Have you lost your mind? If you can't find a living being... you give the 'Brohmodoityo' some raw meat too. That's better. Ideally, in a bell metal plate. Chicken... Chicken... Chicken... Thought I'd come home and cook. Do me a favour and eat up, 'Brohmodoityo'. Disgusting! Uff! 'Brohmodoityo' is a very proud spirit. He was a very strong sense of self-respect. Please be formal and respectful. Mr. 'Brohmodoityo' please have your food. Please. Let's see how long you can carry on with your practical joke. Please give 'Brohmodoityo' some time to adjust to the new place. Please respect his privacy. He will appear in front of you when the time is right. All sorts of strange tales! Nonsense! Please don't be impatient. Give 'Brohmodoityo' some time. When he will be activated... even if you can't see him you'll definitely feel his presence. Your home will be filled with a beautiful fragrance. The temperature inside your house will suddenly drop. You'll feel very cold. Good thing is you'll never have to use the AC again. Electricity bill will go down. Apart from that all the mosquitoes, flies and other pests will disappear. If a strong supernatural force is activated nearby... they feel it. All kinds of made up stories! Damn it! Is it a 'Brohmodoityo' or pest control? Chilly... Who's there? Who-- Must be a draft of wind. Hey! Who's it? Who's there? Tell me who you are or I'll call the police. Who is it? What... What is this doing here? This... This... Now that your 'Brohmodoityo' has been activated... welcome to chapter three. Now, I'm going to teach you... how to communicate with a 'Brohmodoityo'. I have said before, he is an introvert. So, in the beginning, he'll not talk to you directly. You can use sounds or different symbolic gestures... to talk to him. Let's say you ask him a question. You can ask him to communicate the answer by making some kind of a sound. Try it out. Is there someone in this house? Is anyone here? If you're here... If you're here, 'Brohmodoityo'... then kindly make a sound and let me know of your presence. Welcome to my humble abode. I hope you are comfortable here. If you like it here then make a sound once. And if you don't like it then make a sound twice. You don't like it here? 'Brohmodoityo' is an extremely powerful spirit. You can use those powers to your advantage. For example, 'Brohmodoityo' can tell you your future. You can try this feature out too. There's a Manchester v. Liverpool match tomorrow. Please tell me who is going to win tomorrow's match. Knock once for Manchester. And twice for Liverpool. Liverpool... Okay. You ask for boons from the 'Brohmodoityo' too. If he is happy with you... and if you can build a strong relationship with him... he can completely change your life. Do you want to try? Well, Mr. 'Brohmodoityo'... can you arrange for five crore... no eight crore rupees please? Then I can quit my job and settle down. Is it in any way possible? 'Brohmodoityo' doesn't appreciate greed. Moreover, before a strong bond is created with him... he'll not grant you any big boon. You can start with something small. Why are you talking so much? Sir, my promotion has been stuck for a very long time. I really deserve it. There's a girl called Tanusree Roy... She is very undeserving but she might get it. Please give me the promotion. At least, grant me this. It's yours. Oh God! What...What... No, no, no... THE BENEVOLENT GHOST Don't eat too much. You'll burst. Let's have her food. You can have my tiffin. Oh no! You are so greedy. -You were right. -Yeah, she is a glutton. Who is it? -Who's there? -Ma'am, please open the door. It's me. Yes, coming. Aren't you going to office? Sleeping till late? Yes, I have to go to office. Breakfast is ready. Come and have it. Hey! hey! Hey! -Sujata! Sujata! -Yes, ma'am. There was a circle around the trunk... Where did it go? Oh gosh! What a mess you you had made in the room! Red powder all over... Chicken bones everywhere... I've cleaned it all up. Now increase my salary. Can't do so much work for so less money. It's cleaned up... -Hey! -Oh gosh! How...How did you lift it? With my hands. You've put it in the middle of the room. It's in the way. -Cauliflower for dinner. No chicken. -Last night... Can't do this anymore. Huh? This is... so light... Hello. What happened? Tanusree is in a coma. What? She slipped and fell while getting off the bus today. Another car hit her... Sad case. She'll survive, right? No guarantee. Everyone is very demotivated. Boss, too. Of course. -I can't understand anything. -Everyone's morale is low. But what to do? The show must go on. What about your article? Working on it. Listen... Now, you'll have to lead the story, hmm? And after talking to boss, I feel you're getting the promotion. -Promotion... -Hmm... -The boon! -What?? The boon. -There was a Liverpool v. Manchester match? -Yes. -Who won? -Liverpool. Why? There are strange things happening at my place. I mean... I had told you... Please come home with me. -Why are you behaving like this? -Please come with me. You need to see it to believe it. Trust me and come home. Okay. Calm down. I have a few things to finish. -I'll meet you there. -No, but you have to come. I have to tell you something. I'll be there, dear. Let me finish some stuff that I have to. You go ahead. I'll be there. -Hmm? Are you going to be alright? -Yeah. Ma'am, are you back? Did you forget something? What is it? Who... Who is it? Who's there? Open the door. Open the door! Blood! Blood! So much... NOW YOUR TURN Now it's my turn. It's going to be me... I have no idea what's going on, Bipul. Nothing like this has happened in my life before. I'm telling you there's something really, really wrong. Otherwise, this can't happen. Damn it! It's a simple case. A thief broke in. The maid tried to stop him. Thief kills her and takes off. -Simple case. -But... The girl was saying there's a supernatural angle. Supernatural, huh? -This broken trunk? -Don't kick it. Why? What will happen? -No, I mean...ghosts... -Whatever! -Look! Up there! -What? What? -The imaginary cow is flying! -Damn you! Why do you do this? I don't like kidding about ghosts. Listen bro, this is a police case. Don't turn it into a scary movie. Ghosts are only nice to hear about in stories. It makes me very angry in reality. Whatever it is. To each his own. Don't talk like this. Wuss! Listen, you keep an eye here. I'll look over there. Hmm... Moni! Moni! Moni, where are you? Moni! You're such a scardey cat! Quit the police job. So scared! This is no time to joke. Wh--Who is that? Who is that? -Who? -That... That... That...Right behind you. -Who... Who is that? -What's wrong with you? What are you talking about, idiot? You're kidding? Oh! Giving me a taste of my medicine? -Move away from there. -Are you trying to scare me? Move away. -Come this side. -Why? What's there? Hey! Where are you going? What the hell! Hey! Who are you trying to scare us? Hey! Come out. Come out I say. Bro, come scare me. Are you a brother or a sister? Come on. Please scare me too. Superstitious fantasy tales! (humming) Show your face. It's getting late. Want to go home. Who is ? Hey! Who are you? Tell me who you are. How did you enter the room? Where were you hiding? Huh? Who? Hey you! (indistinct) In my years of medical experience... I've never seen anything as grotesque as this. Exactly! -That's the point. Something is unnatural. -I don't get it. There's no explanation... Oh my God! A ghost! -What happened? -This is not a police case. This is a supernatural incident I think. -Supernatural incident? -Madam, please call this number. -I really don't understand. -It'll help you. (chanting) Have you... I mean, did you... Did you feel something? Was there a presence? I'm very sorry to say Ms. Mukherjee... You're right. There's a supernatural spirit in the house. The temperature falling suddenly in different parts of the house... Strange smells in different parts of the house and.... an electromagnetic force. This... All this indicates one thing. You've brought home a 'Brohmodoityo'. Did you feel anything? Did you see anyone? How will he see? Strange! I can see. Yes, I can see. I'm not a run-of-the-mill ghost hunter. I'm a medium. In simple words, I can see ghosts and spirits. I can feel their presence. A lot of people feel I have a great power. But believe me it's a curse. I still can't forget the first time I got the ability and what vile things I saw. I don't want to see those things. That's why I have blindfolded myself. I don't want to see them anymore. That's why I keep this tied around my eyes. There's another reason. Sixth sense. The five senses in our body... when they work and their power is used. But when I cover my eyes, its power gets stored... enhances the sixth sense. helps it. It helps in feeling the presence. That's why... I keep my eyes covered since I don't need to see. Okay, madam? That's why. Did you feel something? Did you feel a presence? Or is it just me? Yes, madam... Are you okay? Yes, madam. There's a 'Brohmodoityo' in your house and... he's angry. Why? You've had the audacity to buy and keep a 'Brohmodoityo' at home... How can he be happy with you? He is angry and can harm you at any moment. But I've always heard that 'Brohmodoityo' is a kind spirit. -He always helps people. -You're talking about the fairy tales, right? -The one in which he helps a farmer. -Hmm... Madam, you're talking about the happy ending in the story. But you're forgetting the ghastly beginning. Let me remind you. Almost 250 years ago... there was a huge village. Outside the village, there was a huge banyan tree. A 'Brohmodoityo' lived in that tree. Once it was evening and the sun had set... all the villagers were afraid to go near the banyan tree. Because the 'Brohmodoityo' would snap their neck and hang them from the tree. You've probably forgotten this history. These pictures tell the lost stories. Take a look. Do you remember now? Madam? But there must be a solution to this problem. What if I throw the trunk somewhere far? Won't that work? No, you can't do anything. There's nothing you can do. If you've got the trunk then you've brought him home. There's nowhere you can run. No witch doctor, amulet, astrologer can help you. Wherever you go, this spirit, this 'Brohmodoityo' will follow. 'Brohmodoityo' is the highest order of entity and you won't have any relief. If he was inside the protective circle you could have controlled him a bit. Now, it's out of hands. You can't do anything. Please, there must be some way. There is one way... You can run away from here. But you have to run away several times. You have to keep constantly running away and 'Brohmodoityo' will follow you. And you can't spend more than one night in a place or else he'll get you. There's another way... Wherever you go you have keep a small animal with you. Like a pigeon, a rabbit, a cat or a chicken. You have to keep something with you. Whenever the 'Brohmodoityo' tries to harm you... you can present the living creature to him. So that he spares you and attacks the animal. And while he attacks it, you can escape. And you have to keep running like this. And you have to give him a life. You'll run. He'll follow. You'll have to keep running. There's no other way. But you're lucky. You were saved because of your maid. If your maid wasn't there at the time... then you wouldn't be here talking to us. You're lucky to be alive. What happened? Blood! Are you okay? The tea has turned to blood. That means... he doesn't want me in this house. I must leave. Yes, I have to go. Wait a second. Listen, please... You said I'll have to run for the rest of my life. But I have a career. I have a life. This can't be a permanent solution. Give me a solution, please. -There is none. -Please... There is no way. There is no-- Where did it go? Keep this stone. This stone is very powerful... supernatural artifact. Keep this stone with you wherever you go. This stone... can help you... Can give you power. Against the spirit. Yes. Keep it with you all the time. Okay? Keep it. What are you looking at? Don't waste any more time. You have run away from here. Get out of here. Yes... yes... Run! Why will I die? What is my fault? -Bad company. -What? That's a kind of flaw too. Switch off the AC. I'm feeling cold. It's switched off. Roll down the window. S**t! S**t! S**t! Don't you smell something? -Please drive faster. No, no, no! -What? -Drive faster. -What smell? Drive faster. He's coming. He's here already. -What are you saying? -Drive fast. -I can smell him. Drive faster. -Calm down. -I'm in the middle of a f**king road here. -Please, please, please. -My head is not working. -Wait. Wait. Wait. -I can't understand... -Let me focus on the road. I don't want to die in the middle of the road. No! I can't understand... What's that? What-- Can you see him? Oh God! He's standing right there. Go away! Go away! No! No! (indistinct) No! Leave him! Leave him alone! Let him go! Leave him! Leave him! No! Let him go! Keep that black stone with you at all times. It saved our lives. Take some rest. I'll get the shot. One gets rabies if a dog bites. What happens when a ghost bites? -I'll come with you. -You rest. I'll be right back. Hurry back. Please. Thank God! Oh God! No! No! No. No. No! There's no one. No one is here. Relax. Souvik! -We have leave. Now! -What happened? How long are we going run? I don't know. I need a living animal. We were saved by hair. But it won't be like this all the time. Hey, do you have a chicken? Yes, there's chilli chicken, chicken curry. Do you have a live chicken? This is food stall not a market. You'll find it in the market. Any other living animal? A rabbit? Or mutton, I mean, a goat. Do you want to eat it or ride it, sir? Mad or animal lover? Hey, listen... There's a village nearby. I'll manage to get something there. -You...where-- -Have to get a living animal somehow. Don't worry. I'll be right back. -Please come back soon. -Will be back in a jiffy. Welcome to chapter four. If you've failed to control your 'Brohmodoityo'... then your life and the lives of people around you are in danger. There's no point in running away. Prepare yourself mentally for your imminent death. We'd suggest that you spend the last moments of your life alone. So that your friends and family are not hurt. We suggest you spend these last moments alone. So that your friends and family are not hurt. All the best. Hey! -Where did the girl go? -He's back. Who knows! Maybe to forest to look for an animal. I can't run like this for the rest of my life, Souvik. This is my problem. That's why I'll have to solve it myself. I don't have the right to put your life at risk. Don't try to look for me. I have to confront him. If I can find his real name and bring him under my control... then I'll see you tomorrow. And if I can't, keep me in your memories. The number you are calling is switched off right now. Please try later. Where are you? Where are you? Who... Who is there? Don't come any closer. Don't come close. Who is it? Where are you? Where are you? Where? Huh? Where are you? I'm warning you. Don't come close. Don't you dare come close. I'll hit you. Who is it? Who's there? Leave me alone! Let me go! Leave me alone! Let me go! Let go! Leave me alone. Leave me! Let go of me! Leave me alone I say! Let me go! Leave me alone. Don't come any closer. I am warning you. Don't move. Don't you dare! -How dare you! -Hey! You dare to give me orders? -You dare to disrespect me? -Yes. You're not worthy of respect. You killed an innocent person. Do you know who you are? You're an evil spirit bought at a discount. I bought you at a sale. You don't have the power to hurt me. You can't harm me. How dare you attack me! Don't move an inch! Don't come close. You are my property! You have to listen to me and follow my rules in this house! You'll do as I say. You'll sit when I ask you to sit. Stand when I ask you to stand. You'll sing when I ask and dance when I say so. Tell me... Tell me your name! No, I won't tell you. Tell me. I can hurt you really badly! What is your name? -Tell me your name or I'll finish you. -I won't tell you. Tell me your name! Bibhuti Mukhopadhyay! I don't have the words to thank you. I wouldn't be alive if it wasn't for you. This stone... -This stone? -Yes, right. It's magnificent. You told us the other day it is a supernatural artifact. -What is it exactly made of? -This is... I have an aquarium. It's my hobby. -I love it. -Hmm. I decorate it with different kinds of things. Mainly with colorful stones like this. The day I came over I already had some stones in my bag. And then... after hearing about the 'Brohmodoityo' from you I realised... that you... don't have the power to dominate the 'Brohmodoityo'. To prove that you are much powerful than him. Then I gave you the stone. Once you got it you thought the supernatural stone will save you. Isn't it? You found courage in your heart. You got your confidence and will power back. You started defending yourself and in front of this will power... The 'Brohmodoityo' accepted defeat. Neither me nor this stone saved you. What saved you is the will power within. You know, Ms. Mukherjee... The human mind is the most powerful thing in the world. The human will power. Hmm... Okay guys, to sum up today's meeting... Our next issue is on depression. And we have to make a very impactful presentation. Because this is a very sensitive issue. No doubts, I believe. -No. -No. Okay. Fine. Great! You can chill. -So, yeah. Let's get to work then. -Sure. -Yeah. -Good. Sayantika, wait. Do you want to say something. We're going to a club after work. Do you want to come? I'd love to but someone will be waiting at home. Your boyfriend? Umm... We'd like to meet him. -No, I mean... -Trust me, you don't want to meet him. -See you later. Have fun. Bye. -Bye. What was that? Why did you change the channel? Gaining knowledge is part of responsibility. It's important for me to watch the news. I've told you to watch the news after I'm asleep. Change the channel, please. What's taking so long? I'm not liking this one bit! That's better. Here you go. Eat up. Huh? I don't want to eat the same food every day. Chicken! Can't you get me some mutton? You're lucky I'm getting you chicken on my salary. Demanding mutton, huh! Four-2-9-7-8-9-5-2-3. What's that? Some home delivery's number? This ticket number will win the fifth prize in the lottery. Prize worth one lakh rupees. One lakh... Hey! Why don't you give the ticket number for the first prize? It would be a minimum of one crore rupees. Give me that number. My life will be set and I'll give you mutton every day. I've told you before also. 'Brohmodoityo' doesn't like greed. Don't disturb him constantly by asking for boons. You greedy woman! I'll sell you off online for Rs. 12. Then you'll know. Hello. Hey! Do you have any sense at all? I've tried to get in touch with you so many times... Horrible customer service! And you're calling me now? I was going to die. Relax, madam. I've called to congratulate you. In 150 years, you're the first person who has brought 'Brohmodoityo' under control. You've achieved an extraordinary feat. We extend our heartfelt thanks. We are sending you a free gift. What gift? We're sending you a high quality widow ghost. Absolutely free. Hey, wait a second... Do you think this is a day care center for ghosts? What will I do with them? I'm having trouble managing one ghost and you're sending me another one! Please don't send me anything. I'm sorry, madam. We don’t have any policy regarding taking gifts back. The gift has already been sent to you. Hey! No, I don't want it. Hello? A widow ghost!
