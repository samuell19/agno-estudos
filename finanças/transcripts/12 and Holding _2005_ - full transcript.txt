I need help. - You know what, Lee? Any parent would be parent of the year next to you, selfish prick. Yeah, well. - You're late. - Yeah, well, I began menstruating this morning, and I had some difficulty inserting the tampon. What? It's a natural process. You know I could conceive and carry and birth a child right now? - Big deal, you won't. - But I could. - [Jacob] Do you think I should have Mom look at it? - Our birthday comes once a year, and you ask for a hockey mask. You don't even play. - Jason from Friday the 13th wears one. He's bad-ass. - I dropped piss on Kenny's head. - What? - Jeff and Kenny were here. I dropped the piss I've been saving on their heads. - Why were you saving piss? - Just in case. Pretty smart, huh? - [Jacob] No, it's stupid 'cause now they're gonna come back here and kick all of our asses. - You're such a butt munch! - [Malee] You guys! It's your birthday! Try to get along. - Malee, take this up, please. - [Boys] Cheese. (Camera whirring) (mom giggles) - Okay, you got your small gifts this morning. Now for the big ones. - Oh, my God! Yes, this is too cool. - Do you like it, Jacob? - [Jacob] Thanks.

Jeff and Kenny pick on you all the time, and you don't do shit. - [Jacob] It's my problem. - No, it's my problem, too, because we're brothers.

I just don't wanna recognize it ever again. - Okay. - This hospital is a nightmare. How are you feeling? - My head hurts. - You're lucky you didn't get killed. - I told you I'm sorry. - I've never been so scared in my Iife. And (sighs) poor Rudy.

Well, you're gonna like Dr. Chung. This is only my second session. She's really good. - I'm not a patient, I'm her daughter. - Oh, yeah, I can see the resemblance. - You trying to make me sick?

And it's okay to cry, you know? - Ma, I know it's okay to cry, okay? I don't need you to tell me it's okay to cry. If I wanna cry, I'll cry. - Fine. (Whimpers) (machines beeping) - [Voiceover] You've gotta eat something. - Leonard has a condition. It's called anosmia. - Oh, my God, is it serious? - No, anosmia is when a person loses their sense of smell. It's not uncommon in patients who suffer severe head injuries. Unfortunately, it's also affecting his ability to taste. Again, not uncommon. - Is it permanent? - That depends upon the patient. - What do we do? He can't eat. - Oh, he can eat. He just can't taste what he's eating. - I can't believe this is happening. - Considering what Leonard could have suffered, he's lucky. And he is severely overweight. Perhaps a loss of appetite will be a benefit. - It feels gross, this film on my tongue. - Hey. - I don't like apples. - So, you can't taste it, right? Maybe you'll like the crunch. (Chainsaw buzzing) (melancholic orchestral music) - Oh, my God. That guy... I, like, know him. He's one of my mom's patients. - So? - Should we go over and say hi? - I just wanna get out of here. - You coming, Malee? - Tommy Camacho. Jacob Carges. Rudy Carges. Rudy Carges. - He's not in class anymore. - Now, how do you know? - 'Cause he's dead. - [Teacher] It is not funny to joke like that about a fellow classmate's death, Mr. Carges. Are you? - His brother. Was. And I'm not kidding. He's dead. - I'm so sorry. - Eight. Ooh! The state's requirement for upper body strength is 10 chin-ups. Leonard, you're up. (Boy giggles) Come on, son. Come on, son, fight it. (Leonard farts) (students laughing) Hey, that's enough. All right, good job. Who hasn't gone? (Boy chuckles) (all playing out of tune) - Did anyone practice over the summer? Great, well, we still have a fall recital coming up. If anyone would like to perform a solo, the sign-up sheet is on the door. Class dismissed. (Clumsy cinematic music) - Not you, Leonard. Center, that's the position you'll be playing in two years. - Football? - You don't like football? - I love it. It's just, I'll never make the weight requirement. - Oh, there's no weight requirement in high school, son. (Leonard panting) These are your new bibles. One on nutrition, the other exercise. Now, you do what they say, and you can play for me once you come to high school. - Thanks. Coach, why are you doing this for me? - Because I've never met a child so out of shape in my life. - [Ashely] I'm being stupid? No, they are wrong, you call them back. - [Jim] Ashley, I talked to the lawyer, he wouldn't lie. - What's going on? - You know what, this is all your fault. - Me? - Yes, because if you'd done what I said and gone to the trial, this never would have happened! - We both agreed it would be too painful! We both agreed! - [Ashley] No, you agreed. - [Ashley] You agreed! - Mom, what happened? - Tell him, tell your son. - The boys who killed Rudy cut a deal. They got a year in juvenile hall and five years probation. - One year. That's what his life is worth. - Ashley, just calm down. - [Ashley] One year. - [Ashley] How can you be so unaffected by this? Your son was murdered! - It was an accident. It was an accident. And those boys were juveniles. - So that makes it okay? (Door slams) (wind chime sounding) - You're dead! (Thunder crashing) - [Jim] You don't believe me. - [Ashley] No. They're wrong! - [Jim] It was an accident. - [Ashley] One. That's what his life is worth, one year. - [Jim] Ashley. Just-- - [Ashley] Your son was murdered! - I can't believe how much you suck. I want them dead. I wanna kill them. I could handle a year in prison. Don't you miss him? You don't even care! - It's not that we don't care. It's just-- - Life goes on. - It does. You have to deal with it. You know 90 % of people's problems are due to their inability to get over the past? - How do you know? - Mom tells that to all her patients. I've eavesdropped on some of her therapy sessions. - That's cool. Can I listen in sometime? - No. Anyway, she says if a person wants closure, they gotta deal with their problems head-on.

All this happened 'cause of you. You deformed retard! - Every night I lie in bed and plan your murder. - I'm shaking. - I'm gonna take a kitchen knife and chop off your fingers. Then your nose, and then your tongue. Then I'm gonna take scissors and cut off your ears. When they find you, it'll be like putting a jigsaw puzzle back together. - You kill me, you come here. - So? What do I have to look forward to? You destroyed my life! - What happened was an accident! - There are no accidents. You're gonna pay for what you did. And it's gonna hurt like hell. (Phone receiver slams) - [Malee] Don't I know you? - You're Dr. Chung's daughter. - Yeah, you remember. We were never introduced. My name's Malee. - Oh, hey. Hi. Gus. Hi. What are you doing here? I was in the mood for a picnic. And I thought this would be a nice place to have one. - [Voiceover] Move that fucking truck! - Right. - Would you like to join me? 'Cause there's plenty of food. - You know what, I don't go for lunch for another 10 minutes. - I'll wait. Meet me by that cement mixer when you're ready. - So last time I saw you, you were just getting back from a funeral. How are you doing? - Okay. Death is, like, so weird, you know? I mean, it's sad... But I also feel like I've been given this sign. A sign which is telling me life is short, so you gotta do what makes you happy. You gotta take chances and get crazy! (Chuckles) - And what are you doing to get crazy? - I play the flute. (Chuckling) - Wellthat's totally nuts. The flute. (Laughs) - No, not like that. Like every year my school has this recital. And every year, I've been, too chicken to play a solo in front of people. But I'm gonna do it, I'm gonna do it this year. - You know what, good for you. That's great. Good for you. When is it? - Why do you care? - Oh, 'cause I'm gonna come. - What? - Yeah. - You can't go! - Sure I can. - Nobody goes to these things. I don't even think my mom's coming. - Well, you're gonna need somebody to root for you, right? And besides, I Iove music. And I owe you for this terrific lunch, right? - Are we having company? - It is all for you. Your favorites. Oh, and I, made everything extra spicy so you can taste it. - Mom, it doesn't matter how spicy the food is. - So you're not gonna even try it? - I'm sure it's delicious. - Forget it. Don't eat. You can't just eat apples all the time. Why not? It's unhealthy.

Though? I haven't fought fires in over three years. - Something stirred your unconscious. If we can figure out what that was, we can get some answers. - Okay. All right! Let's do it! You said that your nightmares started around the time that you moved here. - Yeah. - Let's explore that. Why did you move here? - A friend of mine was working construction. He got a job offer over at the Lindsay Acres job, and, I thought it'd be a good idea to come work with him for a little while. - Are there any recurring elements to your dreams? Faces? - Burnin' For You keeps playing. - Burnin' For You? - Yeah, you know, the Blue Oyster Cult song? - Dad? - [Jim] Jacob! - You okay? - Fantastic. You know... For the past few weeks, I sat in this house. I couldn't move. Everything reminded me of Rudy. And then from out of nowhere, I had a revelation. I'm alive. Your mother is alive. And I became overcome... With joy, because I realized how lucky we are to still have you. - Me? - Jacob. I love you. I went to work today for the first time in weeks. I was fearless. It was as if I'd just gotten out of college. I went after accounts I'd avoided for years because I thought they were out of my league. And I was amazing. I was magic! But then when I came home to share the news with your mother, I found her asleep, and then when I looked at the house, I realized that her office, for lack of a better word, was also piled up, so I took to the house. I have made it my duty to clean this place from top to bottom, even if it takes me all freakin' night. Jacob. - Yeah? - Will you join me? Join me in this symbolic gesture of cleaning out the old and bringing in the new. - Do I have to? - No. ♫ With a banjo on my ♫ Knee ♫ Thank you. (Applause) - A wonderfully rousing rendition.

It's a good song. - Yeah. - What made you choose that? - My mother, she was humming it all last week, you know, 'cause she's a big B.O.C. fan. - Right. - Yeah. - Was she here? - No. No, she's got class. - Hmm. - Yeah. - Well, she missed out. - You're so sweet.

Are you in a cult? - [Dad] (chuckling) Grace. - This is exactly what happens when kids join cults. The first thing they change is their diets. - I'm not in a cult. The issue is that you have stolen one of the most exciting nights of the year from your sisters. - If anybody had done this to you when you were a kid, we never would've heard the end of it. - Exactly. - Now, get upstairs. Now! - I wish somebody had done it to me. Maybe then I wouldn't be such a fat pig. (Snorts like pig) - What'd you say to him? Just stop. Why are you doing this? - To remind you. - How could we forget?

It's not easy being in here. You saw Jeff. - Oh, what happened to him? - Pissed the wrong guy off.

Kind of creepy here, you know. You know that a boy died here? Right before we started this job? - Rudy, his name was Rudy. - Oh, you knew him? - Yeah, he's one of my best friends. You remember that funeral I went to? - Yeah, that was him? - Some kids threw a flaming cocktail at him. Can you imagine killing someone like that? I mean, how evil can you get? Gus? - Yes? - You okay? - Yeah. - Jeff Laskey is dead. - What? - He committed suicide in his jail cell last night. Carol Evey just called to tell me. Justice is served.

Come on, do it now! (Sighs) - Your father and I have seriously discussed... Adopting for many years now, so, we decided to adopt a baby. - Hopefully a boy. - Don't worry, white male infants are the hardest to come by. 60 Minutes did a whole story on it. Any adoption agency worth its salt has at least a three-year waiting list. By the time your parents get a kid, you'll be in college.

You know, I think when a couple has an age difference, they, they end up splitting up because they want different things. - You mean sex? - No, no. Well, yeah, yeah. Let's say you're 12, right? And a boy just a few years older than ya, well, you know, he'll be more experienced, and boys, they can be impatient about that sort of thing. - Are you impatient? - No. But I was when I was a kid, yeah. - Why don't you have a girlfriend? (Chuckles) - Well, I did, but that didn't... (chuckling) That didn't work out so well. - How old was she? - About my age. - See that? Age wasn't an issue, you know? You still wanted different things. I don't think it's about age. I think when two people really connect, they connect for other reasons. And since soul mates are eternal, they have no age.

I love you. - Malee, stop. ♫ Pretty thing, I've got you ♫ Touch me. ♫ Right where I used to be ♫ ♫ We ride across this city ♫ ♫ Starting fires recklessly... ♫ - Where are you going? - To call your mother. - But we're soul mates. - I don't even... know what to say. (Car engine starts) - It's alive. - What happened? - Gas leak. - My mom, is she-- - She'll be fine. She broke her hip and a few ribs. We're trying to get your father on the phone right now. - I have to see her. - Shh. You need your rest. Everything is fine now. (Clears throat) - Before we begin, I want to apologize-- - You know what? It's my fault. I knew she had a crush on me. I just felt bad for her, you know? She's a very lonely girl. If it's any consolation, (chuckles) the whole thing was kinda therapeutic for me. Right. (Chuckles) Sorry. - It's okay. It's your therapy, not mine. Well, so, how was it therapeutic? - I don't remember the last time I slept so deep and so sound. Don't remember dreaming. Nothing. - Why do you think that is? - One of the last fires I ever fought was a brownstone. Whole families wiped out. During the inspection, I went upstairs. And I found a little girl. The whole right side of her face was burned off. But her eyes were open. She was still alive. You know that the pain must've been excruciating. You know? (Sobbing) She was begging for me to, to kill her. - And what did you do? - I did what she wanted me to do. I killed her. I kept telling myself that that was the right thing to do. You know, it's, just... But I've never been so sure. - I'm sorry. Gus, that's devastating. What does all this have to do with Malee? - When I saw her last night, she had the same look on her face as that little girl. She just wanted me to take her pain away. Doctor? I heard it's supposed to rain, so I packed a poncho. - You're acting weird, man. You're not gonna be a chicken. - No. I'm telling you, man, it's gonna be great. You ain't gonna be a pussy, right? - No. - Wanna play some catch? - Where the hell did you get that? Did I say you could touch this? Did I?! Okay, everything, and I mean everything, in this house is mine. You got it? You are not allowed to touch a thing, including this glove! What's wrong now? - I was just looking at a picture of you and Rudy when you were born. God, I miss him. - But you have Keith now. - What the hell does that mean? - You have Keith. Two boys again. Everything's fine. We didn't adopt Keith to replace Rudy. - Didn't you? No, your father and I discussed adoption for years. Honey, we toId you that. - Right. Maybe if it was me that died, you wouldn't need another kid to get over it. - What are you talking about? I wouldn't wish that on any of my children. - But one of us died. And I bet if you could choose which one, you wish it was me. - You know what? I know that you feel we favored Rudy. - You did, admit it. - I admit that he was easier to raise, but that doesn't we loved him more. Honey, Jacob, you were born with a different set of challenges. - My birthmark? - Yes, and it's not easy being different. - I'm not different! You always made it seem like there was something wrong! There's nothing wrong with me! - [Ashley] I know that-- - No, you don't! It's like you don't know what to do with me. You never did. - Well, I'm sorry that you feel that way. You know, you do what you can as a parent and sometimes you don't always make the right choices, but you are my son and I love you, and I would do anything for you. I would fight for you, I would kill for you, I'd die for you! - Rudy used to say the same thing. - And he was right. And as un-Christian as it sounds, I still want the boy that killed Rudy dead. And someday, when you grow up, you'll understand that. Someday. (Thunder crashes) - A week? No, Dad, I can take a train alone. I understand. You, too. (Sighs) He really hates me. - He doesn't hate you. - I'm just gonna go see him. - That is not a good idea. - He doesn't wanna see me, fine. - I just want him to look me in the eyes and say it. I can handle it, Ma. - You don't know him. - That's the problem. Aren't you sick of being angry at him all the time? - He hurt me. - But you have to take me to see him. You have to. - Okay. (Alarm beeps) (wind chimes chiming) - You're late. Put this on. What the fuck is that? - You didn't bring a disguise? - No one gives a shit what I'm up to. - [Kenny] Where are you going? The main road's this way. Yeah, but if we cut through the construction site, we'll hit the railroad tracks faster. - Good point. After you. - I'm sorry, Mom. I just wanted to help you. - I spoke with your father. He and the girls caught a flight. They should be here by morning. - Did you tell him what happened? - I told him there was a gas leak. - I meant the-- - I know what you meant. I didn't tell him, I don't think I will. - Are you mad? - You know... Even if I could manage the food... Can you really see me running a marathon? - You just have to run to the end of the block. It's not as hard as you think it is. - Easy for you to say. - No. It's not. - Okay. I'll try. (Thunder crashing) Ow, ow, ow. (Chuckles) (thunder crashes) - [Kenny] Son of a bitch! I knew you'd chicken out. Where'd you get that shit? Is that real? (Gun cocks) - You killed him. - Come on, man, stop joking.
