A beer, please. Coming up. Hello. It's you. Yes. The biking idiot. How is it going? Bad. I ran into one of those guys who think because they offer a girl a ride, they can do as they please. I guess you got rid of him. Not at all. He's the most persistent jerk I've ever met. He's waiting for me out there. We'll let him wait, if you don't mind traveling by motorcycle. I'm ready. Shall we? Yes. I'm ready. Wait a minute. She's with me. Not anymore. You're wrong. She's coming with me. Is that so? What do you say? I say we're leaving. Hold on. I can't let you take her. Out of the way. Well, they got company. Those are the kind of people that look down on you. Who are they? - She's the widow of Elsa's lawyer. - Yes. How many? Two. Look at them. The only thing they know is how to spend other people's money. That is no reason for hating them. And him? I think he was a clerk who later married the widow. Some people will do anything in order to succeed in life. More cards, please. I'm sure they are judging us. In any case, he's now in charge of Elsa's affairs. One. I find it weird that Elsa's husband is not here. She sent him to solve some issues in Soren. Poor Ernest. It must be horrible being married to a businesswoman. Hello? Elsa, it's Ernest. What's the matter? We're waiting for you. My lawyer is here. Where are you calling from? From Soren? That's ridiculous. I know. What can I do? The notary had to leave due to a family emergency. He won't be back until late in the afternoon. All right. Wait for him. We need that notarization finished. We need those documents by tomorrow or we'll miss our chance. Goodbye. We are here in Soren. I see there's about 60 kilometers between here and Milen. About an hour if we don't rush it. What do we do? Do we stay here or do we keep going for Milen? I'd rather we keep going. Me too, but it's getting late. Anyway, your call. I don't mind traveling at night. Bartender. One whiskey and a call to Milen. - Keep the change. - Thank you. I saw two roads that lead to Milen. Yes, the new highway and the old road. Which one would you recommend? The old road is shorter, but... But What? That road goes through the lower part of the valley, and this time of year, the dusk brings fog. Thanks. How much do I owe you? $10.50. Your life is yours to do as you please. Exactly. But if you had some dignity, you'd leave your wife. You know I still love Elsa. Yes, I know that. Not too long ago, she loved me too. We used to be happy. I hope one day we can be again. Nonsense. Why won't you tell the truth? What truth? You're not leaving Elsa because of her money. You're wrong. I have my own fortune. You had it, sweetie, but you spent it on women like me. Wait, don't be mad. Forgive me. I shouldn't speak to you like that, but that's how I am. Besides, you know I love you... Thank you. -And I can't stand watching her treat you like a servant. Everything changed when her father died. She inherited a big fortune and she had to handle all his businesses. I don't know how it happened, but she suddenly stopped being a loving wife and she became a businesswoman. Who won't even have sex with you. I'm sorry, Ernest. I'm sorry. Don't go. Don't be so grumpy. Hold me. Please, hold me. Honey, what good is money without love? What good is love without money? The guests are finally leaving. You drank too much. Watch your mouth. Shut up. Someone is coming. I spoke to my husband on the phone. Does he have the notarized signature? Yes, but his car's shaft broke, so I need to pick him up. We're going with you. No, that's not necessary. He won't take longer than an hour. We'll go with you. I'll take my car. That way, we'll get the document and we'll continue our trip. You must want to get home. I intend to be back by tonight so I can submit the paperwork first thing tomorrow. It's hard to tell distance on these roads. Do you fear we passed the fork? I do. Listen. That sounds like a car engine. Yes. It's coming. Maybe they know the road. I'll ask. Watch out, Fred. I don't understand the urge to get back tonight. I didn't know there would be fog. There always is this time of year and you know that. Can you see Elsa's car lights? No. She knows the road but I don't. She should know that. When she realizes she's too far ahead, she'll stop and wait for us. I wouldn't be so sure. I need to catch up with her. Don't be reckless. Do you want to get lost in this fog? We shouldn't have left. Don't speed up, idiot. Shut up already. Don't make me more nervous. Careful with that curve. Yes, I saw it. Don't yell. You're going left. Turn right. Turn right, we're going to crash. Get off. Hello. Are you lost? Careful at the fork. The road to Milen is on the left. I hope this road's not too dangerous. I mean, with this fog. It's narrow but straight. No curves until the top of the hill. Thank you. Wait. Did you see a big, old car pass by? I haven't seen any cars. Ah. Who is there? Who is there? Who is it? Answer me, please. Who are you? Answer, please. What if we took the wrong road? I'm pretty sure we turned left. But the road should have been straight and steep. That's what the man said. But this road is neither straight nor steep. Are you okay? Yes. What happened? What do you think? We're lost, that's it. Help me out. Help. Help. I feel I'm in another planet with suddenly appearing and disappearing roads leading to nowhere. Help. Did you hear that? What was that? Help. What happened? What happened to you? I'm being chased. No one's chasing you. I don't hear it anymore. What? What aren't you hearing? The breathing. What happened to you? I don't know. I was in my car on my way to Soren. And you got lost in the fog. Yes. The same happened to us but we were headed for “Men. It's obvious that you and us took the wrong turn at the fork. No. I was on the right path. I know that. Then I stumbled upon a cemetery. I can't see anyone and I can't hear anything strange. Are you sure that...? Yes, I'm sure. First, I heard a noise like a deep, gasping breathing. Then, I saw a man. Tall, muscular, wearing a chauffeur uniform. I couldn't see his face, but I saw his chest and it seemed as if he had... He had a... I don't know. Maybe I imagined it. Tell me, was this uniformed chauffeur alone? No. He was with an old lady in black. You don't believe me, do you? You think I'm crazy. No. I told you what I saw. I'm not crazy and I'm not seeing things. No, you're not crazy. No one said that. Calm down. It's just that this is weird. The only truth is that we got lost. Your car broke down. And I can't go anywhere to get help because this fog is too hard to navigate. Not to mention that, according to the map, we're nowhere. Well, that's true. We're nowhere. But there's a cemetery. Where there's dead people, there ought to be living ones. The town might be across the cemetery. Are you thinking about going there? No. We'll go around the wall until we get to the entrance. That's where the town must be. Look. See that? A Rolls. What about it? Don't you think this is the kind of car a uniformed chauffeur would drive? It's the same plate. Unbelievable, right? What is unbelievable? That this car almost ran us over a half an hour ago. It's an abandoned cemetery. The town must be as black and solitary as those graves. What kind of place is this? I'd never seen it. It's not real. Of course it's real. Don't you see it? Don't talk nonsense. This path must lead to the town. There's a light. Over there. Come on. Turn that light off. Didn't you hear me? Well, we meet again. So it seems. You? Come in. Elsa? So you got lost in the fog too. How come you opened the door gun in hand? When we arrived here, someone was trying to break in. When they heard us, they were frightened and disappeared in the fog. I thought I saw them in a uniform. Yes, they were wearing a mess jacket, or something like that, and high boots. Boots. Yes, I was probably lost in the fog too, but I would have found the way to Milen if you hadn't rammed me with your car. The fog was very thick. Drop it. The truth is we're stuck now. Indeed. During this time of year, the fog doesn't disappear until late in the morning. If you wish, you can spend the night here. I just saw there are four rooms available, albeit a bit dusty. Ms. Clinton brought us here after the accident. -We honked, and... -I heard noise and I went outside to see what happened. Where are we? An abandoned town about 15 kilometers from Milen. Could we make it there? That's not possible. You'd get lost in the fog. Sit down, please. How did you get here? By bicycle. On a path through the woods, but this fog would make it very hard to find. I could try on my motorcycle. Try what? To get to “Man. Do you know how you got here in the first place? I made a mistake at the fork. I turned right. No. You turned left, but instead of going straight, you took a road that ends on this town. But we arrived at a cemetery. This road branches off into others which lead to isolated farms. You took the road to the cemetery. It isn't finished yet. See how easy it is to get lost in the fog? How come you didn't rush for Milen once the fog started to roll in? I thought it more cautious to spend the night here. This house belongs to me. But I only come once in a while to clean up. I live in Milen. I'm surprised you also got lost at the fork even with the fog. Why? Because you know this region well. How do you know that? I've seen you in Milen. I don't recall seeing you. We come from different worlds. Speaking of different worlds. I have the crazy feeling that I crossed the border that separates the real world from the unreal world. I had never heard about this place. It's no surprise. Its inhabitants abandoned it years ago. They must have had a reason to do so, right? There are some theories. The locals here are superstitious. There was some sort of epidemic and word got around that people were killed by a vampire biting their throats and drinking their blood. Thus, the town was abandoned. I heard about a night when 12 people died. Apparently, that was the last straw. The survivors buried their dead and left forever, leaving their lands, their homes, and everything they owned. Listen. That noise is coming from here. Please, don't open it. I haven't been down in the cellar for years. The last time I went there, I saw a rat. I got so scared that I never opened that door again. Besides, the lights aren't working today for some reason and I'm very nervous. If that's a rat, it must be enormous. If you want, I can kill it with a bullet. You open it and I'll... No. Rats horrify me. Please, don't open the door. Fine. As you wish. Well, there's no more noise. I see you're interested in the portrait of my great-aunt Julie Clinton. Yes. I saw the resemblance. My aunt was an eccentric woman. They say she was into witchcraft. Maybe that's why she collected all these paintings. That's just a guess. There is no truth in that. Anyway, she stayed in this house when everyone else had left. Only the graves in the cemetery across from here reminded people that there used to be a town that was ravaged by a vampire. Did she live alone? No, she had service. A brute of sorts who was her servant, gardener and chauffeur. He was always by her side. She trusted that man. It seems that she drove my aunt's Rolls very well, but one day, he was drunk while driving and he crashed the car against the cemetery wall near here. Both of them died instantly. They died? Yes. Thirty years ago. She broke her neck and he pierced his chest with the steering wheel rod. Are you unwell? What's the matter? She's on medication. She's having a nervous breakdown. Do something. She can't breathe. Let's take her to the window. She's been like this before. We need to bring her to her senses. Are you feeling better? Can you hear me? Answer me. Do you feel better? Let's lay her down on the couch. Thanks. I'm better now. You really scared us. We didn't know you were so nervous. I'm sorry. Come, sit down. You need to rest. Yes. Is it true she suffers from the nerves? Yes. Ever since her father died. Did he die in an accident? No. He had a heart attack. He was with a young lady in her daughter's bedroom. It was a terrible scandal. Why? You youngsters might think this is very natural, right? However, those my age thought it outrageous. We have different views. Anyway, the fact is that Elsa, having lost her mother at a young age, was very fond of her father. This resulted in a nervous trauma from which she's been unable to recover. How do you feel? I'm better. I passed out, didn't I? Yes. I'm sorry. Here, take this. You'll feel better. It's a sedative. Do you need anything? No, thanks. By the way, Mr. Porter, are you comfortable? Yes. Perfectly. - Don't you need anything? - No, thank you. You're very kind. Goodnight, Mr. Porter. You won't be cold with this. Get some rest. Help me out. This is all I have to offer. My apologies. Don't worry. Thank you. I hope you're not too uncomfortable. We'll be fine. Don't worry. How's the nervous wreck doing? I gave her a sedative. She'll fall sleep immediately. I have a feeling she won't fall asleep so easily. If you need anything, you can call for me. Everyone else is in their bedroom. Thanks. Goodnight. Goodnight. Where are you going? I'm going to check on Elsa. She must be sleeping. Leave her alone and go to sleep. What if she needs something? Ms. Clinton will tend to her. Come on, come to bed. You need to rest. We have a very busy day tomorrow. You're scared. Wait. What do you want? To know. To know what? What's going on here. And you think the answer is in there? Possibly. Go ahead. Did you notice? The lock feels very smooth. Not a single creak. Right, so what? If I remember correctly, Ms. Clinton said that this door hadn't been opened in years. You're right. Look it at once. No. Calm down. I want to see something. This is very dark. What is it that you want to see? The story about the rat seemed off. Why? It couldn't be a rat that was making that noise. Do you see? No marks. But if it wasn't a rat, what was it? I don't know. That's what... Look. What do you think? It wasn't a rat. Come on. Let's get out of here. I'm scared, Fred. Shall we dance? Were you asleep? No. What do you want? I thought you might need some company. I don't need it or want it. Goodnight. Do you want a sip of whiskey? No. Don't you feel alone in this room so grim? I beg you to leave. It's awful, and it's not just this one. All the bedrooms are. To be honest, I'm nervous. That's why I thought you might like some whiskey. I don't want your whiskey or your company. Leave. Get out of here. Do you really want me to go? Yes. I guessed as much, but I wasn't sure. Now, there's no doubt. Of What? Why tell you? You know it well. Excuse me. How is it going, dad? It's fine, sweetheart. I can't complain. You look lovely. You don't look half bad for your age. An orange juice, please. Nice compliment, sweetheart. You know very well you don't look your age. But something gives you away. Is that so? What is that? You like them younger. I saw you with Adelina. How can you talk to that child about love? She's not a child. She's your age. I'm aware. Today it's Adelina. Who will it be tomorrow? Do you want me to introduce you to someone? No, thanks. I'm fine on my own. I don't need your help for this. I saw you dance. I take it you had a fight with Ernest. That's right. Take my advice as your father and as an old man. Get away from him. Ernest has his own wealth and... That he inherited from his parents, yes. He'll never amount to anything. I don't agree. Well, suit yourself. If you'll excuse me, they're expecting me. An extra dry martini. Ernest, what a surprise. I'm very glad to see you. Are you? Are we starting over? I'm begging you. Please, Elsa. I'm old enough to idealize a woman I love. I see you as you are. Capricious, dominant, spoiled. I thought you loved me some. I love you. You're beautiful, young, I like you. I just can't stand your ridiculous whims. Please. Fine, let's talk. Let's go, shall we? I'm sorry about yesterday. I promise I won't get mad over nonsense again. I hope so. Where are we going? Wherever you want. Take me home. Home? Yes. We'll be alone. Who is it? It's me, Porter. Can I come in for a bit? Ms. Clinton. Is something wrong, Mr. Porter? No, nothing. I just feel lonely. Don't you? Come in, Mr. Porter, and close the door. Perhaps you'd like some whiskey. I don't like drinking alone. I thought you wouldn't mind keeping me company. Hold on. What? Can you do me a favor, Mr. Porter? Yes. Tell me. Turn around. What? I'm asking you to turn around. Yes, I get it. As you wish. All right. Fred? Fred? Fred, are you there? Answer me. Laura, it's me, Fred. Don't scream. Idiot. You scared me to death. I'm sorry. I didn't know that was you. That's why I turned the flashlight off. What are you doing in here? Investigating. You'll never guess what I found. If it's bad, I don't want to know. Nonsense. Come and see. I'd rather not see anything and run away from here. This tunnel leads to a crypt. What? Come with me. You'll want to see the Clinton family mausoleum. Elsa? Good night. A father is not a God you worship. He's a man as any other with defects and virtues, someone who can disappoint you bitterly. A husband can also disappoint you. Right, honey? But this time, I didn't do it. Admit that it was you who failed. Admit it once and for all. You failed me. I thought I heard yelling. I came to see if something happened. But you were asleep. It must have been a nightmare. Yes, it was a nightmare. You were very upset. If you want, I can stay here and keep you company until you're calm. Why don't you tell me about your nightmare? No. It's too private. I don't want to talk about it. I understand. I feel exhausted. I'll try to get some sleep. This corridor was probably built to come to Mass in the family crypt. What an unpleasant place. That's weird. What is weird? The slab that covered the tomb was moved. Look. "Julie Clinton." “1864 - 1942." Julie Clinton. It seems that woman actually lived. If she and her chauffeur died, how come we saw them on the road? That's what I would like to know. Do you see anything? It's empty. No. Yes, and I don't get it. Either Martha Clinton is lying to us with her story of an epidemic and a vampire, or there's something truly inexplicable going on here. Do you mean she is the vampire? I don't believe so, but that's the general idea. Are you serious? If you intend to scare me more than I already am, you won't make it. I have no such intention. I'm just trying to understand. Understand this evil mess. "Clinton Family." Do you see? The only thing I see is that I'd rather be in the fog than in that awful house. Who is there? That's Porter. Porter, what are you doing? What's the matter with you? Porter, don't shoot. That man has gone insane. Stay here and don't move. Laura, come here. What's wrong with him? He's dead. Are you sure? Yes. Maybe he had heart issues. It might have happened when he saw us leave the mausoleum. He was already dead. What? Rigor mortis has already set in. You see? He's stiff. How did he shoot us? I don't know, but this gun was just shot. Do you hear that? Yes, I hear it. What is it? No idea. Hey, stop. I have a gun. I'm warning you. Shoot, Fred. Shoot. Stop. Stop or I'll shoot. Let's run. It's useless. We're trapped. Let's go back to the house. Here, help me out. What happened? Move, please. Do you mind telling me what happened? He's dead. What? Have you seen my wife? No, why? She's missing. What? Indeed. We went to bed last night, and when I woke up, she wasn't by my side. I looked for her in Elsa's bedroom, but there was no one there. So Elsa is missing too? Yes. I've been looking for her everywhere. I haven't found her. Goodness, what happened to Mr. Porter? He died. That's not possible. How did he die? A heart attack. It was probably caused by an intense emotion. We'll have to wait for an autopsy to know for sure. Don't you smell something burning? Yes. Something's burning. Over there. Laura, try to put out the fire. Don't just stand there. Come back soon, Fred. She's regaining consciousness. Take care of her, will you? Are you leaving me alone? It's necessary. Why? Because something must be done and quickly. What are you planning? To find the truth. Here. You know how to use it, right? Yes. You remove the safety. Exactly, and then you pull the trigger. I'll be right back. How is she? She's asphyxiated from the smoke. She is in shock. She needs medical assistance. Listen, young man. Do you intend to go to Milen on your motorcycle? Yes, that's what I'm doing. Don't do it. You won't make it. You'll get lost in the fog. Possibly, but I must try. Good bye. If you make it to Milen, notify the police. I will, don't worry. Why did you leave me alone? I thought you were asleep. I was asleep, but I was woken up by a sound and you weren't in the room. I'm here now, don't worry. Where were you? I was looking for this blanket. You need warmth. I need to get dressed. You should stay in bed. I want to get dressed. All right, but stay in bed. Where did you put your clothes? In that wardrobe. The gun, give me the gun. I put it here on the bed. Let's get out of here. Come on. Hurry. Don't stop. Please, hurry up. Come on. Step away. Step away or I'll shoot. Come on. Help me. Come on, help me. What's wrong? What's the matter? Elsa, what are you doing here? My husband, where is he? What's the matter, Mrs. Tremor“? Please. What's wrong? The pills. Which pills? The sleeping pills. My husband gave me sleeping pills. He said I needed them. All right, dear. We did it. This was your best performance as an actress that I've seen. It's a shame it wasn't at your theater. It's interesting seeing to what extent fear can dull the senses. Porter, dead from a heart attack. Elsa, gone insane. The couple, they think Porter's corpse shot at them at the cemetery. They didn't even realize that the only real bullet was in the chamber while the rest of the bullets were blanks. We need to dismount the speakers and wipe the magnetic tape. Igor will take care of that. Don't worry. The sun will be up soon. We must hurry up. Imagine the policemen's faces when the youngsters tell their story of ghosts and vampires. And we'll just tell them that nothing happened here. They'll probably take them to a madhouse along with Elsa. Of course. Oh, it's you. Everything went perfectly just as you planned. However, the agreed amount is not enough. You'll have to double it. What are you doing? Are you mad? Listen, I... What was that? What was that? A gunshot. Mrs. Tremont, don't fall asleep, please. Try not to fall asleep. What is the meaning of this? We did our part. What do you want now? All right, pay us what we agreed. We'll take whatever you give us. No. No, don't shoot. I swear I'll never say anything. You'll never have to worry about me. Laura? Laura? Laura? Laura? Laura? I'm here, Fred. I'm here. Laura? Come on, come on. It's all over. Come on. Laura. We can't waste a second. Come on, hurry. We can't leave them. We have to. We need to tell the police and call for an ambulance. It's almost dawn and we only have the motorcycle. Elsa.
