All right. Well, the water looks good. I think we're all set. It hasn't rained in a while, so there should be maximum visibility. Just follow my lead. Yeah, right. I'm not the one who wanted to quit early last time. You follow my lead. Oh, I see how it is. First person out of the water buys drinks tonight. Oh, you are on. Got you! Just dive, you goofball. Mike! Mike! Ah! Are you sure this is the right pier? That's what the directions said. Do you have all your gear? Yes, Dad. I double checked this morning. All right, let's go. It's supposed to be around here somewhere. With a name like the Jubilation, it shouldn't be that hard to find. Well, you could just starting screaming, "Jubilation! Jubilation!" That should get their attention. I don't know if that's the attention I want, Dad. You know, I really wish you were coming on this one with me. One of my sea legs is faulty. But as soon as I get my bum leg out of this stinky cast, we'll hit the high seas again, okay? On this one, you need to scout this new charter boat and the captain. Make sure they are both up to snuff, okay? Sir, yes, sir. On a very important scouting mission. What's the name of this captain again? Banning? Captain Banning. And remember, be respectful of her and her boat, okay, just like Papi taught you. Hey, can you slow down just a little bit? They won't leave without you, I promise. I paid a lot for this charter. Are you okay? Si. I just wanted to show you this. You did not bring this picture! I did bring this picture. It's so embarrassing. You know, I'm glad you're not coming on this trip. - You're way too embarrassing. - You take that back! Okay, fine. I wish you were coming on this trip. But enough with the picture already. I love this picture! Look at you. So determined. Eight years old, out in the pouring rain at the break of dawn tossing that reel over and over again trying to nab the big one, huh? Just like Papi? Yeah, well, I hope I get to reel in some big yellowfin soon. Oh, wait. I think I see it. Yeah, that's it, the Jubilation. Kind of looks like an old boat. Uh-huh. So you want me to walk you out on the boat? No, Dad. I'm a big girl. I think I can handle this on my own. Okay, good. 'Cause I don't think this cast will make it out on that rickety dock. Dad... Okay, remember, be respectful of the captain and her boat, okay? Oh, and if you need any tips, you call me? - Yeah. - Okay. Oh, and photos. Take lots of photos. Okay, lot of pics, yeah, okay, I got it. I gotta go. I'm late. - Bye, I love you. - Okay. I love you too, Lucia. My little angler. Okay, then. Captain Banning? Yep, that's me. Oh, I thought... You thought you'd see a woman, right? N-n-no, I didn't think... I wanna captain my own boat one day. My dad just... It's okay, it's okay. I guess with a name like Shelly you can't help it. People see the paperwork before they get here all the time, they think they're gonna see some old salty sea hag. Then they see me and you have that same look on your face that you have when they see this salty old sea dog instead. You must be Lucia. That's me. Jump on aboard, Lucia. Thanks. I'm looking forward to catching some yellowfins. My dad and I, we caught some a few years back up north in San Diego. Yeah. Fish is good up there, especially this time of the year, but we have bigger ones. Your fellow anglers have arrived. Oh, I can't wait to get out there, D. I haven't gone fishing in I don't know how long. And the horseback riding on the beach tomorrow... one for the bucket list. And today I get to take off deep sea fishing off my bucket list. Me too. Who knows? Maybe I'm secretly an expert. Well, there's only way to find out. Hey, I'm Wyatt. This is my fianc√©, Donna. Hi. This is Lucia. Hey. And I'm your captain for the day. Call me Banning, Captain Banning, whatever you want. Just don't call me Shelly. Got the new radio, Captain. And this here's Shatto. He really doesn't talk much. He talks enough for both of us. Shatto's my first mate. You been mate for how long, Shatto? Uh, too long. Too long, yep. That's about right. We got a few life vests for you. Do we have to wear these? I'm just concerned... I'm really trying to get like a tan. And I don't want to mess up a tan line, you know. Uh, if you're on this ship, you do. It's regulations. No exceptions, no excuses. You can probably take it off later on when we get past the Coast Guard. I can make this work. We're gonna have to make helmets work tomorrow for horseback riding. I guess you're right, D. So there's a little something that I like to do before we go on a voyage. Not that I believe in luck, but it's supposed to bring us some. So here goes. It's a fisherman's poem. "Give me luck to catch a fish so big "so that even I, when talking about it afterwards, may not ever have to lie." Shatto, let's get this "before" pic out the way. And maybe the "after" pic, the boat will be filled with fish bigger than your dreams. Yeah. Hey, my dad used to have a camera like that when I was a kid. You hear that, Shatto? We're older than dirt. Come on. Huddle up together, y'all. - Say "feesh"! - Feesh! Hey, you know, my pop taught me how to drive a boat like this when I was a kid. - Oh, is that right? - Yeah. What do you think about me taking it for a joy ride once we're on the open water? Not on your life, kid. Besides, you're gonna be too busy pulling in a lot of fish. So you won't be able to steer this vessel. Worth a shot. Now you all have your licenses intact, which means you're gonna be on the Jubilation for like five hours. Now the Jubilation may not look like much, but she's a tough old broad, kind of like my ex-wife. Now I won her in a high-stakes poker game in Chicago playing against a Lake Michigan pirate. He could barely hold his hand. So I skunked him and he followed me all throughout Lake Michigan, Erie and Superior trying to get his boat back. So I had to come all the way to Cabo just to get him off my tail. True story. We're gonna go out a little bit further. You can blame it on global warming, the Illuminati, Big Foot, I don't care. It's just that fishing's been a little light this season, but I know a place. We go out further where you're gonna catch a certain amount of divine yellowfish tuna that you've ever seen. So just sit your butts in your seat and enjoy the ride. He's a character. That he is, bro. How long you been doing this for? A few years. Captain took me in when I was caught up in some bad stuff. Taught me everything I need to know about this boat. Gave me some purpose, you know. He knows what he's doing, though. That story about him winning the boat in a poker game, is that true? No clue, and I've asked. I can never get a straight answer out of him. Details change from one charter to the next, though. You know, you really shouldn't text on a boat. It'll make you puke. Not me. I've never gotten seasick once. Lucky you. Texting your boyfriend? My dad. He worries. Only child? Yeah. Me too. Sometimes you love the smothering. Sometimes the smothering is just so... smothering. Yeah, sometimes. It's just been him and I for so long. Oh, I'm sorry to hear that, but I know the feeling. I'm lucky to have found Wyatt. He has four brothers. Family gatherings will never be boring again. That's beautiful. Oh, thank you. Yeah, he's got good taste. Think I'll keep him. It seems like he really loves you. Like I said, he's got good taste. Woo-hoo! This is it, y'all! Water's a bit choppy, but this is my secret spot. You can't see it right now, but you look right over there, that's a sandbar. Kinda acts as a barrier, sort of funnels the bigger fish this way. Later on this evening when the tide recedes, those beautiful yellowfin tuna will have no place to go but jump on our hooks. Nice setup you got there. Thanks. My dad and I kinda collect lures. When I was a kid, I would beg my dad to bring me to the sport shop whenever I had enough money in my allowance or birthday card. I'd run right to the fishing section and I'd spend hours picking out a rainbow jig or fly spinner. Well, I see you got one of these. I got one of these, but never had to use it, though. Gotta be prepared. I see you are. Sure you don't wanna use live bait? I mean, those yellowfins sure do love some mackerel. Thanks. I prefer the jig. Less chance of the bait coming off the hook. But I will give the mackerel a shot if my jigs don't hold up. Spoken like a true angler. I'm gonna let you get to it. Think I'm gonna check on our happy couple. You two better get some bait on your hooks. Oh, those are definitely not beers. Nope. Frozen mackerel. Those yellowfins will gobble them bad boys up, I guarantee. Shatto, help this fine couple bait their hooks up, will you? Aye, Cap. You wanna give it a try? Why don't you do the first one so we'll know how to do it properly? You're gonna want to get it right through the eyes. Right through there so they can't turn around and bite the hook. See? I see. Right through there. All right. You can try the next one. You're all ready to reel in a real prize catch there, D. I already got a prize catch, babe. Ooh. How about we up-anchor and move a bit further out? Whatever you say, Captain. Sure about this, Cap? We never been this far out on the charter before. You know, there's a lot more dangerous things than yellowfin in the deep water. Shatto, they came to catch fish. They don't wanna waste their time and money. We'll be fine. Yeah. Yeah, understood. I'll have him in the sky ASAP. Davila, we need you in the air now. We just got a report of a jet ski attack involving sharks. We need to make sure these shivers aren't moving closer to shore. On my way, Officer Fuentes. Do you see anything? Nothing yet. Just some jet ski debris. Wait, wait. I see a whole shiver. They're attacking the jet ski debris. But it makes no sense. There's nothing for them to eat. These sharks have gotten more aggressive in recent years. My brother just had a run-in, I don't know, a few months ago. Yeah, it looks like they're staying away from shore, moving more out in the open water. Copy that. My recommendation is to send a warning out to all vessels within 10 miles of shore. No in-water activities, no swimming or diving, no fishing. These sharks have become hyper-aggressive nowadays. All right. I'll get the word out immediately, but you keep flying. See if you can spot any more of them. And see if you find out exactly where they're heading. Copy that. I'll stay as close to them as I can. All right, good. Out. Open an emergency line. Warning! All vessels must cease in-water activity immediately! Make your way back to shore only if safe to do so! Be on heightened alert for sharks. Contact Marine Search and Rescue if spotted. I repeat, all vessels must cease in-water activity immediately! Do you want me to help? This one is kind of putting a fight, but I think I got it. - You got it? - Got it! No problem! She's got one? She's got one! Whoa! Looks like we got a pro over here! Let's see, a really nice one! Woo! First catch of the day. Now, who's next? Woo! Wow. I can't wait to tell my dad! I can fillet it up later for you if you want or if you want a mount or whatever. Not sure. I might catch a bigger one with my next cast. - Okay. - I like that spirit! Oh, my God. Oh, my God! All right, just stay calm. Go easy with it. Just start to slowly bring it in. - Okay. - Reel it in. The more you fight, the more the fish will do the same, okay? Okay. Wyatt, I caught a fish! You got a fish. - You got this, D.! - Oh, my God. Looks like a lucky day on the Jubilation! It usually takes about an hour before we get the first bite. Just take it easy, reel it in and pull. Reel and pull. Reel and pull! Reel and pull! Reel and pull! Get her on the boat! Wyatt! Wyatt! I've got you, D.! Wyatt! Wyatt! Hold on! Pull her back in the boat. Just hold on! Help me up, Wyatt! Wyatt! Here! Here! This might help! Grab the net! Come on! Stop, stop! She's gone! No, no! I can't let her get away! Wyatt, no! No! No! I see it, it's right by the motor! Out of my chair, Wyatt! Out of my chair! I told you, I'm the only one that pilots this ship! Cut the engine! We gotta keep moving! Cut the engine, Cap! There's something wrong with it! We gotta get to shore! We've got to get to shore! We're gonna be in major trouble if we don't! We're gonna be in trouble if we do! - No! - We've got to get Donna! She's gone! - We gotta do something! - She's gone! - I gotta get Donna! - She's gone, bro! - I gotta get Donna! - She's gone! - Donna! Donna! - Wyatt, she's gone! Come on! Come on! Ah! I'm sorry, Donna. I'm so sorry. You tried your best to help her, bro. That's not gonna bring her back. Donna... She's gone. She's really gone, man. I had her in my hands and she was just here a second ago. She didn't even want to go on this fishing trip. She did it for me. We were supposed to go horseback riding on the beach. I'm... I'm sorry. I mean this is horrible, I know. I'm sorry about Donna, Wyatt. We gotta figure out how we can get back to shore. I mean, we've already lost one passenger and... The shark's trashed our engine. Yeah? What are you gonna do about it, huh, Captain? What's your plan? Wyatt, I think I can fix this. Let me get what's left of the net. I gotta free up the engine before she'll start. Shark's caught up in it. Not looking good, Cap. I don't know how we're gonna get her operational. She's not gonna move like this. I see a problem I can fix. Let me help you there. Ah, hooked yourself, huh? It isn't the first time. You'd be surprised how many hooks I've cut out of people since I started this business. Okay, keep it steady, keep it steady. Keep it steady. - Okay, okay. - Keep it steady. Well, I had this one group of kids that were casting their poles like they were fly-fishing on an open river. So this one kid whips his pole back and the hook gets caught in the scalp of the other kid behind him, right there behind his ear. So the kid with the pole just starts yanking like he thought his hook was stuck in a net or something, I guess. So the other kid behind him is... grabbing the hook out his scalp and just screaming, like, ahh! I tried to help, but I just couldn't get to the back of the stern fast enough. How did the kid take it, removing the hook? Well... Let's just say you did better than him, champ. Let me patch that up. Okay, keep it right there. Whoa. It's still alive? Shatto! Get back! I got this. I don't want to be useless. All right. We can get out of this if we work together, brother. - All right? - All right, fine. Dude! Antagonizing the shark is not gonna help anything! Fine. What do you want me to do? Right now we have to focus on getting the oar between the shark and the engine. Can you do this? Yeah, yeah. Let's go! Come on! Get deep in there! You gotta get all the way in there. I'm trying. Come on, push! Keep pushing! - It's moving, man! - Keep going, keep going. It's moving! Oh, shit! Man overboard! Get him the oar! Wyatt! Wyatt! Pull him in! Do you see him? He's over here! Get back into the boat! Wyatt, get out of the water right now! Back here! Come on, Wyatt! Get back to the boat! I'll kill you, you piece of shit! Wyatt, listen to me! This will not bring her back! Wyatt, get out of the water and get in the boat! Wyatt, get back in the boat! Hey, you guys see that? I killed the shark! Wyatt! Look out! There's another one! - Wyatt! - Come on, Wyatt! - Swim! - Faster! Wyatt! We gotta get this engine sorted out. There's more of them. We gotta move, Captain. Three of them. Never seen them act this way before. Probably desperate for food with the number of fish being so low this year. Exactly. I mean, either we sit here and wait for them to come to us or we get back to shore. Back to shore. I agree. Shatto, see if you can get that engine fixed. On it, Captain. No luck, captain. It's pretty shot. I want to check the electrical and see if that's the issue. Gotcha. And the radio signal is being spotty. Any ideas? You know, I don't bring my phone onboard. I got a phone. What's the emergency number in Mexico? Same as it is in the United States, kid. 911. But good luck with getting through. Fast response is not their forte around here. I'll call my dad. He knows a lot of people in the area who might be able to help. The reception is spotty but... I'll try to get through. No. What is it? Battery's low. Well, make this call count. It's ringing. Okay... okay. Oh... Dad? Hey! You're back so soon, huh? Did the ocean run out of fish? Listen. There's been a really bad accident. I'm okay, but... Two others fell off the boat and were eaten by sharks and our engine just seized. Okay. Sharks... did you call the Coast Guard, honey? Our radio was damaged during the attack. They won't make it out here in time, dad. We're dead in the water and there are so many of them. There's so many sharks. Okay, okay, honey. Stay calm, okay? I will relay the message to my contacts down there, okay? What is your location? Uh.. The coordinates are 22 degrees, 52 and 46 west, and 110 degrees, 3 and 22 north. Okay, okay. Stay on the line and I'm going to call my friends on the landline... Dad, I can't. My battery is low. I have to save the battery. Okay, so just sit tight. I've got this. I'll get someone there soon, okay? I've never seen so much blood before. Baby, baby, it's okay. I'll get the Coast Guard there soon, okay? Look, you're safe on that boat and you are the most comfortable when you're on the water. Remember that, honey. Yes. You got this, you hear? Okay. Yeah, I can do this. Just... please hurry, dad. I love you. I love you too, Lucia. Yes, hello. I am on land, but I am relaying an emergency of a boat that is stalled off the coast. Si, yes. And there's been two fatalities... shark attacks. Could you please get me with the Coast Guard, please? No, no, now! My daughter is in danger. No, no! Don't put me on hold, please! You...! Oh... He's calling the Coast Guard. Someone will be here soon. How does that engine look? Bad news, cap. We got a few stripped gears. A little bit of a burnout, but it's not fatal. I'm doubtful we can get it up and running, though, without a total overhaul. Best to let it rest and not risk a total flame-out. See what you can do to get us going. Aye, aye, Cap. Okay, my daughter is out there. Sir, we're getting someone as soon as we can, okay? Okay, please hurry. So I said, "Wrecked 'em? Damn near killed 'em!" That gets funnier every time you tell it. Hey, come on. That's a classic. Try to get a new joke, Captain. Your phone's buzzing. Jose, old barnacle! When are you gonna come down here? We'll tear up this port like we used to. All right, Dan, there's an emergency. Lucia took a fishing cruise today and there's been a couple fatalities. Is she okay? How can I help? Look, she's stranded and there have been some shark attacks, a couple fatalities. And I called the Coast Guard, but God only knows when they'll show up, right? Yeah, it'll be sundown before they get there and that's if she's lucky. Is the Dew Drop up and running yet? Give me a pen. No, no, she's in the shop. But I'll tell you what. I can wrangle up something. Look, I'm sorry I couldn't get her on the charter myself... No, no, no! Don't be sorry. You can make it up to me by getting me a boat as fast as you can get me out there as fast as you can, please! No, I'm gonna get us out there fast, okay? I'm not letting you alone out at sea with that foot of yours. Now give me the coordinates. Okay, buddy. I promise you I'm gonna wrangle up something, all right? We're gonna get your little girl. I need to warn you, my friend, there are sharks involved. It's never easy, is it? Well, we'll just have to leave sooner than I thought, that's all. It'll be impossible to find them once the sun sets. Thanks, Dan. I owe you. I'm on it. Give me another coffee, a big one. Okay. She's gonna be okay, por favor, Jesus. She's going to be okay. We haven't moved in such a long time. And all this blood splattered against the boat, they probably think we're another shark or a whale a.k.a. dinner. Yeah, I'm working as fast as I can. This motor is still jammed. Once that sun goes down... I know, Cap, I know. How you holding up? Is that hand hurting you? Doesn't even hurt. I'm still running off of adrenaline. I don't feel a thing. Good. Adrenalin's good. Keeps you alert, on your toes. So... We're gonna make it out of this. Got it? Yep. Yeah, I know my dad's gonna pull through. We'll put through. And you're gonna have one hell of a fish tale to tell him when you see him. On, no! We're taking in water! Oh my God. The hull can't keep taking a beating like this, Cap. She'll break into pieces! It's just us out here! We don't have the luxury of waiting for help to arrive! We need to find land... and fast. And the wind is picking up. We'll be blown further out soon. No, no, that's actually a good thing. We're drifting, so the wind will point us into the direction of the sandbar that we were at earlier. And that should buy us some time. But we're gonna have to help this old girl along if we're gonna make it out. We're gonna have to move! She's not gonna be seaworthy much longer! Can we use the oars to paddle? We'll have to try. You start paddling. Try not to provoke the sharks. But give 'em a good whack if you have to. There it is! The sandbar! Put your backs into it, people! Keep on paddling! We're almost to the sandbar! Aye, aye, Captain! We hit ground! Nice job, crew. So I don't think we're gonna sink for a bit. Thanks, Cap. I think it'll be too shallow for the sharks here, but they are smart creatures, so we need to be careful. But we've only bought ourselves, you know, a little bit of time. We're already on the high end of an ebb and flow. It doesn't seem like they're leaving. We can only hope that they get bored, but I doubt it. We're gonna be easy pickings at high tide. There... There. It's a boat! Our luck's 'turned around! Hey! Hey! Help! Hey! Help, over here! Help! Over here! The sky's too bright. They can't see the flare. They can't hear us either. Engine's too loud. Hey! Over here! Hey! Hurry, stand up! You can stand on the sandbar! Mayday! Can anyone hear me? Mayday! - Shatto! - Lucia! Come here! - Lucia! - Shatto! I'm coming! Come on, baby. Come on. Watch her legs. Come on, move, Shatto! I got you! We're gonna have to put a tourniquet on this wound, pronto! How bad is it? I'm not gonna lie to you, kid. Getting bit by a shark is not good. It hurts. Tell me... tell me something. Listen to me, listen to me. Eyes up here to me! Eyes up here to me! Eyes up here to me, kid. Tell me something. Why do you like to fish? Wh-what? Why do you like to fish, Lucia? Why do you like to fish? Because it's as simple as life can get for you. It's, uh... oh! Yeah, come on. Come on, baby girl, come on. It's... it's one person and one fish with a thin line between you. And sometimes... you make that cast and you make that connection and sometimes you don't. There's no wiggle room in between. Life doesn't... Life doesn't really offer up that many absolutes like that. Yeah, I like that. It's like you get the fish or the fish gets you, right? Plus, it give me more time to spend with my dad. Come on, come on! When... After my mom passed, we both felt like were on borrowed time. And we were terrified that something would just come along and tear us apart. Yeah, yeah. I actually lost my mother when I was young, too. And it's not something you ever really get over. I can't die out here. No, no, no, no. I can't leave my dad alone. No, no, not today, kid, not today. You're not dying on me, not today. It's not gonna happen, okay? You'll be fishing with your father again real soon. Hey, hey. It just mouthed you, Lucia, okay? Barely a bite. You hear that? Just took a little gnaw at you, just a little gnaw. Even though, a little bite from a shark is still a pretty big bite. Not helping, Shatto. You must taste like crap, kid. He took a bite out of you and just spit you right out. There's so much blood, though. I wanna call my dad. I wanna call my dad. Just sit up. Sit up. No! My phone is missing! My bag must have been torn, it's ruined. Come on, sit back, sit back. I can't die out here. I need you to breathe. Don't over exert yourself. I need you to breathe. I need you to breathe. Come on, breathe. There you go. She's gonna go into shock. We can't lose her. She's a soldier. She's not gonna make it much longer, man, if we don't hurry to get her help. We got about a couple of hours. Yeah, that's a lot of blood. Just need you to keep the tourniquet tight and make sure it doesn't loosen up. All Right. I'll do what I can to keep her awake. Thank you. Time is really working against us. S.O.S. from a fishing vessel, shark attack, two casualties. Copy. Where's the vessel? What's your location? Officer Fuentes told us to reach out to you for possible assistance. Well, a couple of miles south of Cabo San Lucas. Scanning the shoreline for sharks. I'm already following one shiver. Where do you need me to be? Should get a visual on them shortly. Then we'll give you exact coordinates. Roger that. Keep me posted. Stay safe. All right. I need everyone to contact every vessel they can. Find out if anybody saw anything regarding that jet ski attack. And find out if anybody knows anything about the Jubilation. Come on, Lucia! See anything? No. It's clear seas. Can't this thing go any faster, Dan? It's all I could get on such short notice. It's not a speedster, but it floats. Well, look at that! It looks like the Guard's have finally gotten off their butts and doing their job! TK-421. TK-421! TK-421! Didn't they send a chopper? Try to catch up with them! I'll try. They're a heck of a lot faster than this old floater. Good news that the Guard's out looking for 'em. Si. We're gonna find her, my friend. I can't keep up with them, but eventually we'll catch up to 'em. Thank you, Dan. I appreciate you doing this. I owe you one, my friend. Hey, you and your daughter just have dinner with me when this is all over. And then we'll call it even, right? You got yourself a deal. She's gonna be okay, my friend. Eventually the tide will get high enough to pull us off the reef. We don't have much time before the boat starts to sink again. How's Lucia? She's good. She's stopped bleeding for now. Her color's coming back. You know I can hear you. Man, stop being a big ass baby. You're going to run out of bandages, you know. Got plenty. But you are gonna be looking like a few mummies in a little while. Lucia, wake up, please. Can't have you falling asleep until we get some help. You okay? Um, yeah. Actually, I'm the only one that's not cut up or bit, aren't I? Yeah, but you should rest. I mean, you're taking care of everybody. It's the captain's job, my friend. Hey! Get up! We can't have you falling asleep, Lucia. On your feet, soldier. On your feet! Okay, okay, I'm up, I'm up. Try not to put any weight on your leg. You can prop it up if you need to, okay? I'm gonna go below deck to see if I can find something to help. You care about him a lot, don't you? Yeah. When I first came here from Hawaii, I didn't know anybody. Captain took me in when nobody else would, gave me a job, taught me all about this boat, and gave my life purpose when it didn't have any. Kind of like you said. Life doesn't give you many absolutes. So the captain is your absolute. Well, I absolutely wouldn't be here without him, for better or worse. He helped me, so I'd do anything to help him. If you sad sacks stop talking about me, maybe I can give you a perfect update. Water's filling up quickly below in the deck. This means that we have to jump on the offense situation. Now these sharks are beautiful creatures. Massive monsters, who survived on sheer grit throughout the millennium. As much as I know that we like to marvel at these perfect relics in their natural habitat, we gotta realize that they're trying to end us. Now, personally, I'm not trying to get ended yet. Now we don't know when the Coast Guard is coming. So we have to do something. So we fight back. Exactly. Now the water's still shallow, so that means we'll see the sharks when they get close. Now when they do, we let 'em have it. You use that thing a lot out on the ocean? What? This right here? More than you know. Used for customers who don't pay me. Don't worry. Your credit card went through. I got one! Starboard side! Come on, what are you waiting for? Ah... Better be careful! Those aren't dolphins! Come on, come on. Shatto, watch out! - That's my first mate. - Yes, sir. Yeah. Great job, crew, but the tide is still rising fast. We're still taking in water and we still haven't gotten any help. So we're not out of the hot water yet. Lucia, you definitely need some medical attention as soon as possible. I'll be fine. Lucia? Lucia! - Lucia! - Lucia, wake up! Wake up, kid! We can't let her go into shock! The tourniquet is still holding, she should be good. Lucia, wake up, kid. Wake up. Lucia? Lucia! Lucia, wake up! Wake up, kid. Lucia? Wake up, kid. You fainted on me, kid. I did? Yeah, too much excitement, I guess. It's okay, I'm good, I'm good. Here. Take a swig of this. Fighting off hungry sharks can make you thirsty. I'm gonna go clean some shark blood off of the boat. Get off! Give it back! Give it back! He's gonna yank you under if you don't just drop that bucket in the water. Yah! I hate these sharks! Once the water lifts us off the sandbar, we'll be targets again. We'll float a bit, but we're taking in so much water that those sharks will practically be able to jump on the boat with us. It's just a matter of time. Am I dreaming or is that a boat? That's a boat. The Coast Guard. Hey! S.O.S.! Over here! Over here! - Help! - Hey! Over here! - Hey, over here! - Over here, help! Hey, over here! Hey, I think we're saved! I think we're saved! Go grab your stuff! Lucia, grab your stuff! Shatto, just grab the essentials! Yes, yes! Wait, wait, wait, wait. That doesn't look like any Coast Guard vessel I've ever seen. What? It's got to be. Well, you're right. It's definitely not the Coast Guard. I don't care who it is. We're saved. Wait a second. That's... That's my dad! That's my dad! Dad! That's them! Chopper One, do you copy? Go for Chopper One. TK-421 is having trouble locating the vessel. Do a perimeter search five miles out and see if you can spot anything. Roger that, Office Fuentes. I'm on my way. Did you get a call sign or a name of the vessel? We did. The initial report says... and we just confirmed... it's called the Jubilation. - The Jubilation? - That's correct. Are you sure? 100%. Why? I was on that boat a couple of weeks ago. I caught the biggest fish. All the more reason for you to find that vessel. With food harder to find, those sharks won't hesitate to attack a boat full of fish. I'll search as fast as I can. All right, good. You update me if you find anything. And Davila, didn't know you fished. You never asked. I go out with Captain Banning a few times a year. I just don't know why it had to be the Jubilation. I mean, Banning's one of the most respectful captains out there. Really? Like he even took in his first mate when he had nowhere else to go. Man, I hope he's okay out there. Do you have any idea where he could be? Anything at all that could help us locate that vessel? Well, normally, Banning sticks closer to the shore. But the fish are moving out further out these days. So this one time, he took us to the sandbar. Man, the fish were jumping into the boat. It was like... that was the best day of my life. Do you remember where this sandbar is? I know exactly where that sandbar is. Heading that way now. Lucia! - Dad! - Lucia! Dad! They don't know about the sandbar. Over here! Lucia, are you guys okay? Stop! There's a sandbar over there! Oh, no. Dad, please stop! Dad, please stop! I think they want us to stop. Why stop? Stop the boat! Stop the boat! Watch out, brother! Some extremely hostile sharks over here! The first thing I need to know, are you okay? We have one severely injured! We need to get her some medical assistance in the boat ASAP! Dad, I'm okay! Dad, I'm okay! Lucia, baby why are you bleeding? She's okay! She just needs medical attention to get in the boat! Dad, I'm okay! I was just bit. I'm fine. Is that Uncle Dan? - Uncle Dan? - He's a friend of my dad's. Hold on, Lucia! We'll be over there in a quick minute! We're coming, baby! No! No, Dad, no! Wait! If you come any closer, you'll be trapped on the sandbar just like we are! Dude, stop! Stop or you're gonna get stuck! Back off. Okay, okay sit tight! Slow down, slow down. Why are they so aggressive? These waters... they've been chummed up by some dead sharks! Dad, they've already eaten two people and they're still hungry, okay? They won't leave us alone! You gotta get us out of here! Okay, okay! Just hold on and let me see what we got in the boat! What do we got, Danny? Do we have something? What do we got in here, Dan? We got this! Okay! Okay. I'm going to throw you this rope and you tie it to the bow, okay? And we pull you off the sandbar! Got it! Attaboy. Okay, tie it to the bow! How's your motor working? It's dead, but if you pull us hard enough, we'll get closer to you. But you gotta do it quickly 'cause there's a hole in the hull and we're pulling in a lot of water! Secure the rope to the boat! Okay, on my signal, Dan, okay? Hold tight, baby. Daddy's gonna get you out of here. Papi's coming! You better do it quick! This boat's being held together by a lick and a promise! Now! Come on, you little dinghy! You can do it! It's no use! It's really wedged in there! We've gotta get off this boat, Dad! We're too heavy! I got a plan, Cap. I'll jump out, dislodge the front of the ship. No! Shatto, no. That's suicide! There's sharks still out there! No. No way. We've lost too much today. And I'm not losing you, brother. There's gotta be another option. You know there isn't. Shatto, I can't ask you to... I'm gonna do it whether you give me permission or not, Captain. Look, the boat will be lighter with me off it anyway. And, look, you can distract them on the other side with this. All right. We'll use both. It might work, but you better move fast. Aye, aye, Captain. You hear me? And I do mean fast! Aye, captain. What's going on? We've got a plan! Just make sure when I give you the signal, you fire up your engine! Trust me, captain. I can do this. That's my little girl over there! Hey, it's gonna work, buddy. You ready for one last cast? I'm ready. Okay, Shatto. Ready! Hey! Come on! Come on! Don't fall apart on us now! Come on! Better make it quick, Shatto! We're running out of fish! Pull! Pull! We got you, hold on! We got you. Keep going! We're almost there! It's working. We're moving! It's working! Okay! Come on! Get back here! - Move! - Come on! Come on, Shatto! Move, Shatto! - Shatto, come on! - Just move! Don't look back! Move! Shatto! No, Banning, I cannot lose you, either. - Shatto! - Banning, no! - No! - Shatto! Come on, you know we have to keep moving. - Okay, you know it. - Shatto... Hey, hey. Banning, you know we have to get off this boat, okay? We have to go. Okay.. okay. Come on. I got you, baby girl. Come on. Hold on one second! I'm coming, Lucia! I'm coming, baby! Come on! - We're out of time here! - Come on. I got you, I got you. Banning, come on! This is my boat! I choose how it goes down! Captain Banning, just leave it, just let it go! Yeah, you want this boat? Come chew on this! Come on! Danny! Danny! Help! Uncle Dan! Oh my God! - No! Uncle Dan! - He's gone! Lucia, he's gone! Honey, he's gone, baby. Come back here. Come back here. Come back here. Banning, get your butt in here! Banning! Come here! Wait! Give me my tackle box! Go on! Get in here! Wait, my leg. Are you okay, honey? Are you okay? Matches. I need matches! I need matches! I quit smoking. - Will this do? - Atta girl! You're gonna have to drive, hon. 30 years we were together! To the Jubilation! Goodbye, girl! Thank you, Danny. Whoa. Come in, Officer Fuentes. There's been an explosion. Copy that. Can you get close enough to find any survivors? It's almost impossible to see anything through the smoke. I might have to circle down a little bit lower. You wait as long as you need to. We can't leave until we know for sure one way or the other. Roger. You're all right, baby. Get ready. The smoke is too thick. I'm gonna have to circle back. Do two more pass throughs and then we'll call it. Copy. Come on, Banning. Where are you? Come on. We'll find him. Don't worry. We have to. Banning can't be gone, not like this. Look, I never told you, but after my divorce, I was in pretty bad shape. I'd work, come home, that's it. Just work. I even canceled my fishing trips. But Banning... he found out where I live, came to my house. He refused to leave until I agreed to go fishing with him again. I'm sorry. I just can't give up on this. I gotta find him. Well, keep looking. We won't call it in either way until we know for sure. Thank you. There's gotta be something we're missing. Wait. I think I see something. It's a life raft! Are you sure? Yeah, yeah, I'm sure. Yeah, that's it! - Hey! - Yes, it is! It looks like Banning's with them. We got 'em! We got 'em! That's them! That is great news, officer. Get TK-421 on and let them know. Copy. Tango-Kelo 421, do you copy? Go for TK-421. Hey, we found the survivors. Looks to be three of them. And Captain Banning's one of them. Copy that. I'm mounting a rescue ASAP. Congratulations. We found the Jubilation and Banning and the rest of the survivors. Okay. Hey, a celebration is definitely in order when you get back to the station. Thank you. I'm looking forward to it. Now if you'll excuse me, I have to drop a ladder and get them out of this mess. Copy that. See you soon. - Down here! - We're saved! Down here! Hey! Yes, we are! Hey! Hey! It's okay, baby. We're going home. Quick, quick, come on! Okay, okay. We're good, we're good. But what about the Jubilation? Oh, no big deal. No big deal? Didn't you have her for all this time? That's just what I tell my charters. Truth is, I just bought it off eBay last year. All these people... gone. Wyatt... and Shatto. They're all just... gone. But not forgotten. Si.
