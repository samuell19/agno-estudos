Would you lay with me In a field of stone? If my needs were strong Would you lay with me? Say a prayer. I need it. All you gotta do is sing. Knock them dead. - You ready? - Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. - Ready? - Are we ready? That's great. I knew it was all good. Here we go. You're back with a new project, the first one in 17 years. - Come on. - Yes. Can you believe that? Why did you wait so long? Were your plans to never make new music again - until this happened? - What was the reluctance there from you? Well, we got a little old gal over here who started at the tender age of 13 - making hit records. - Didn't she? Ladies and gentlemen, here's our second guest of the day, Miss Tanya Tucker. Delta Dawn What's that flower you have on? Could it be a faded rose From days gone by? And did I hear you say He was a-meetin' you here today To take you to his mansion in the sky? I first started singing when I was about 9 years old. I sang in every talent show, whatever club that I could find. Her very first record was released when she was only 13 years old. It was called Delta Dawn. It became number one on the country music charts and there were many more hits to follow. By the age of 15, she had a Grammy nomination and landed on the cover of Rolling Stone magazine. Fame, multimillion-dollar record deals, and countless hit records followed. Here you are at the ripe old age of 19, and you're considered a country and western great. Does that get to be a bit much to carry around? Ladies and gentlemen, Tanya Tucker. So we have all followed her since she was a little girl. You think, that girl can sing. Over the years, Tucker's personal life, especially her fiery and well-publicized affair with Glen Campbell, has kept her in the public eye. - They love to write about you, don't they? - Yeah, boy. Well, how much of it's true? Tanya Tucker is on top of the charts this week. Tanya Tucker is part of this Sunday's halftime show. She's still making headlines and topping the charts. The unstoppable Tanya Tucker. Everybody always describes you as being this wild child, this... That's sort of been your rep. Do you think you are? When the good old boys of country music go out and drink and have a good time, it adds to the aura. When a gal does it... Doesn't look so good. Do you think any of that hurt your career? In a way, I don't think you could be successful unless you've had a lot of failures. And I've had some. You had these years of depression. - It wasn't a matter of months. - Yes. No, it was years. I got thinking, what's wrong with me? I'm the life of the party. I tried everything because I wanted to be better. It's something I've not conquered. - It's a good room. - It's a great room and there's a good piano. I bet it's the piano that's in there now. Man, this is cool. When I first got pulled in the project, it was Shooter. Because Shooter knows about what a Tanya fan I am. I have loved Tanya Tucker since I was 8 years old. Tanya's voice is in all of us that sing country music. Time for us to do an about-face and recognize that. Brandi and I are of a different generation, but we're people that really care about older music and we really care about the past and the future. And with Tanya, there's kind of this well that we're all kind of drawing from. And I think that there's a certain kind of responsibility for music being in good hands. When I heard that Tanya Tucker hadn't made a record in the better part of 15 years, I suddenly realized how much I had forgotten and how much I think that the rest of the world has forgotten how potent an influence Tanya Tucker has been on women in country, and rural Americana music. And I wondered why they had forgotten, and I wondered why I had forgotten. Man. I'm nervous. Because they can't get it off their mind now, so... - Hi, there's... - Hi, baby. Hi. Good to see you. - Good to see you. Love you. - Long time no see. - Hi, Tanya, I'm Brandi. - Hi. I feel like I know you. - Me too. - Good to see you. We were talking... What about doing "High Ridin' Heroes"? - Yeah. - "High Ridin' Heroes"? - Yes. Let's do it. - Shit. It'd be great to get into this thing. Let's do it. Didn't expect that reaction when I was like, "Let's do it" - because that's like... - We got it. - I love that song. - It's dialed in. We're doing it. Wow, do you hear that? Time was when he was... The rodeo is just an old man's dreams Down in between - No. - He's a credit to his flaw. - Oh, my God. - In the flesh. Those old hard times They're nothin' new Once you've done the best you can do You just tip your hat to the wild and blue And ride off to the west Oh, I love that song. - I'm getting chills on my legs. - Yeah. The ease in is what it's all about, so... The only thing I forgot... There is this little hangout room here. - A hangout room. - How are y'all? - I'm good. How are you? - Good to see you. - I'm Chris. - Chris, Tanya. - Eleanor. Nice to meet you. - Eleanor. - That fellow right there, that's Tim. - Hi, Tim. Tim's got an identical twin, so try not to get worried - when you see two of them. - Oh, my gosh, yeah. I'd freak out if there were another one around like me. - Feels good. - It's a good vibe, isn't it? So where's those big tape machines? Right there. And I'm starting to get really nervous. So, Tanya, did you know that Rick Rubin yesterday... The other day when we talked on the phone, I called him and I said: "I have the opportunity to make a record with Tanya Tucker, and I want this record to be a Renaissance period in her life - and in her career. - Yeah. And I want it to expose people that weren't aware of her to her music in the way that Johnny Cash's American Recordings did. Rick always had his finger on the pulse of young people and their longing for understanding where their music came from. You're not old. It's not about your age. - It's not about where you are. - Fucking getting there. But it's about the influence you've had. Because Dolly Parton was 1967, - but you were 1972. - Two. That's really nothing. That's five years. That means that you are as important to the U.S. music as Dolly is. And Dolly is seen as the ultimate icon. And you are seen as the ultimate icon to the hip people that know, but I think more people need to know. That's sweet. It means a lot. I mean, if anything, I mean, God, you know, to be able to leave behind something, you know, that's good, you know, that done something for somebody. And I guess music is, you know, the gift I have. - It's the only thing I'm given, you know. - I've been saying to you -and I've been calling Grayson, going: -Right. "Let the pressure go. Just enjoy it." - Which she's doing. - This is about you. This whole thing is... It's not about one hit song. This is so much more about... It's more about Tanya fucking Tucker. But I'm not comfortable with that. I've been kicking, fighting, scratching all the way. - God touched you with something... - Yeah. And he gave it to you as a gift. And you have it, and you have to use it. - And for you not to use it is a crime. - Would be a crime. Yeah. I thought about this so much over the last month. I will not let you down. - Okay. What key is this in? - What key...? - The original is in C. - It's in C, and I felt that would be too high for you. I'd go with G. Was king - I thought G might be a good one. - Okay. You wanna go down...? You wanna hear it in C, the original? - He'd just play it and... - Sing in the key the guys are singing in? Well, I don't know. I mean, if it feels better. High ridin'... Yeah, it's way too high. High ridin' heroes They're anywhere the wind blows He's been to hell and Texas And he knows how it feels To be ridin' that hot streak Drunk on some back street I like that better. - The lower step is popping a little more. - Yeah. And under the wheel - Yeah. - Cool. - Yeah. I'm feeling it. - Okay. - Where's the...? Tequila. - Ice? Tequila? Oh, I hope Chris didn't get ahold of it. - No. I... No, the... - It's right there. - There's an open one, right? - This one's open. - This one is open. - Okay. I'm lucky. - You're gonna taste this. - Okay. Oh, yeah. We got ice? - Yeah, we got ice. - I'd put some ice in there. - I don't wanna ruin your chemistry here. - I know. I love that. - Oh, shit. That's good. That's dangerous. - Good, huh? That's ruby red grapefruit juice. It's good, isn't it? - It's damn good. - It helps it go down really easy. So this is the master here. - Yes. That's overall volume. - Okay. Hey, I just wanna let you guys know, Tim and Phil think the kick drum - needs to tighten up a little bit. - Awesome. And he's a credit to his flaws He's a credit to his flaws, to his flaws He's a credit to his flaws - I'm ready when you are. - Everybody sounds beautiful. Tanya wants to do an intro with Shooter on the piano. I like that. Let's give it a whirl, shall we? - Okay. - All right. One, two, three, four. Right here, Tanya. Daylight or midnight Holy shit, man. Red eyes... - I'm lost. Sorry. - No, you're right, you're right. - I was right? - It was not you, Tanya, it was Shooter. It's still me. It's still me. Shooter, are you excited? I feel like you're excited, - and I like it. All right. - There you go, you funny. - Let's do it again. - Funny as hell. All right, all right, all right. - I'm... Okay, see, I'm missing it. - No, no, so... - You mind some company? - I'm kind of... You're doing great. I was wondering if I could be... To be ridin' that hot streak - It seems like I'm rushing my words. - You're doing bril... You're perfect. Every time you thought it was you, it's them. So don't worry about it. Time was when he was king Now the rodeo's just this old man's dream The highs are few and far between The lows get the rest - Everybody happy now? - Yeah. Because that sounds real good to me. Let's get it. - Rolling. - Can we try one, just to humor Brandi, - where you say "she" instead of "he"? - Yeah. It's a good idea that Shooter had. I'd love for you to hear it that way. And if you're like, "No, I wanna hear it with the male pronoun," we'll do that. Time was when she was queen Now the rodeo's just her old man's dream The highs are few and far between The lows get the rest These old hard times ain't nothin' new Once you've done the best you can do You just tip your hat to the wild and blue And you ride off to the west Those old high ridin' heroes They're anywhere the wind blows She's been to hell and Texas And she knows how it feels To be ridin' that hot streak And drunk on some back street Falling off the wagon And under the wheels Oh, shit. - Okay, we got it. - Yeah, nice work. - That's really nice. We got it. - You have female heroes? - Female ones? - Yeah, women heroes. - Elvis was big for me. - Elvis. - Yeah. - Elvis was really a big... He was really influential to me. Funny, I have never really had any girl... Mostly Haggard and... To me, Haggard was everything. He was just like... See, when I was a kid, it was you. You were everything. - That's wild. - Because... Well, because you sounded so tough. - I knew I was a bit different. - Yeah. - I knew my gender wasn't on point... - Right. With the other women in my family, and I felt a little bit different. But I was like, "Tanya sounds tough," you know? Yeah. And I still remember every word to all those songs, by heart, - and every growl you did. - Sometimes I don't. And every time you said "hey" with your little yell in front of the H. - Yeah. - Every time. - My little yodel back there somewhere. - Yeah. There's so much about my music now that wouldn't exist. And I see it in number-one country singers every day. I wonder if they know where they got that from. - They got it from Tanya Tucker. And so... - I stole it from Haggard, though, - you know? - Bullshit. First time I remember listening to music per se is... Was in Willcox, Arizona. So I was about... I don't know, 5 or 6 maybe. And there was a country radio station in that town called KHIL Radio. I've often thought, what if that would have been a rock 'n' roll station? Yeah. - You know? - Yeah. - Might've been... - You might've had a different life. - Totally turned out different. - So that radio station - was influential to you, yeah. - Was very... Yeah. - You're not from Nashville, Tennessee. - No. I live there, but I was born in Texas and raised in Arizona. We lived in a 12-by-50 trailer in Willcox, Arizona, out on Fort Grant Road. We were very... I don't wanna say poor, but we were broke. We were busted. My sister and I would be washing and drying dishes every night. We'd do harmony and start harmonizing. She would harmonize with me and my dad started listening to it and felt, "That sounds pretty good." He'd make me read over and over and over to him. "One more time with feeling. Do that with feeling. You don't have enough feeling." He said, "You should never be smiling when singing a sad song." Well, we started singing in church and singing at the VFW hall. What was the first time you ever sang in public for money? I think it was in Calaveras County at a frog jump contest. Where people bet on the frogs? - Yeah. - Kind of a strange job. I got about $50 for it or something. So one day you went to a fellow and said, "I can sing." And he had you do eight songs one night? Mel Tillis. I went to him and said, "I'm a singer." I was about 9 years old. And he said, "Well, can you sing?" I said, "Yeah." And so I went back and I sang a song. He said, "Come on." I went on stage with him. And ever since, they've loved it. I got to be known as the little girl with the golden voice. Daylight or midnight Red eyes and that old hat Whiskey bent, busted flat She's a credit to her flaws She's a bad risk but a good friend Small change and loose ends She only regrets that she might've been A little faster on the draw - Pushing it there a little bit. - Yeah. Yeah. Right there. "She's..." It sounds weird. Vocal take is so good. Your voice sounds so good. - You play guitar? - No. - You play piano or anything? - No, I... It's one of my biggest regrets. - Really? - Yeah, that I didn't learn to play guitar. I think it's very instrumental, very, very important. If I play guitar, I would... I probably wouldn't have a band most of the time. I'll be, "This is me. This is an evening with y'all." - Yeah. - I wonder if your delivery isn't as potent as it is because you don't play an instrument because of the fact that you know you gotta be more potent without one. So when you say something, it's much more powerful than your average singers leaning a little bit on their instrument. I don't know. I don't think about it too much, you know. Yeah. I could see why you wouldn't. It just sounds like when you sing the lyrics, it always sounds like you wrote them. It always sounds like it's... That's interesting because I've had several songwriters - tell me that. - Yeah. I got a chorus and I'd sang it to Loretta the other night. She called me. Wanna know if I will need any money. I'm thinking, next time I'm gonna say for the hell of it, "Yeah, I do." - Wait. Loretta Lynn? Loretta Lynn? - Yeah. Loretta Lynn. - Is she asking if you need money? - She always worry about me. - "You need any money?" - That's amazing. - I'm thinking, "Is this a trick question?" - That is the sweetest thing I've heard of - Yeah. - In my life. And so I said, "Listen, I got..." And I said something about... going to somebody's funeral or something. I said, "Man..." I said, "Bring my flowers now while I'm living." Because I won't need your love When I'm gone Don't spend time, tears or money On my old breathless body If your heart is in them flowers Bring them now And she goes, "Is that...? Oh, hey, what...?" She goes, "Did you write that?" I said, "Well..." I said, "That's as far as I got with it. So I don't guess I've written it yet." She's like, "I wanna write that. You get over here. We'll go write that." - "We'll write the verses." - She gonna write it? - She wants to. - We can write it and put it on this record. That belongs on this record. - What? - Yeah. That's amazing. It's just waiting to be written. It's just laying there waiting for a pencil. - For me to pick up the pencil. - Since we're cooking, why don't we get the feel right for "Seminole Wind Calling." You got where you're at? One, two, three, four. Seminole wind Let me feel your breath again Take me back To the place your love did find me Black ribbon, lead me home Wherever I may roam And may the bridges That I cross not burn behind me - Here we go. Modulation. - There you go. As I followed this great highway - You enjoying this, Tanya? - I'm having a great time. Can we tell Tanya about my idea that I have? - Yes. - Okay. - Miranda Lambert is one of my favorites. - She's my favorite... - She's my pick of the litter. - Is she really? - Oh, yeah. - Okay. So she wrote a song - called "The House That Built Me." - Her idea is for you to do that song. No. I said... Man, when I heard it, I went, "Goddamn." But it's just you have a different story to tell than Miranda does. In all of Middle America, so many people have lost their farms and their houses and the place that they raised their kids. And I thought about changing the script of that song, a couple of nuanced words to where she comes up and she's, "Ma..." Says, "Ma'am, you don't know me from Adam. But those hands on the front porch, they're mine, not yours but your kids." And it's a different thing. It's a wiser voice. And when I even hear it with that perspective, I get a lump in my throat I cannot make go away. Because we were real poor. We lived in desperate poverty. I did that in Willcox, Arizona, see? I went back. - You did? - The trailer house. But it was gone. But my dad had put my handprints and I signed it "Tanya Tucker." Were you raised with your mother? Did...? My mother, my dad, they were married, like, 67 years when he passed, you know, in Thanksgiving morning, of course. - I bet you miss him. - Yeah. Are you one of those people that still feels him? - You think he's around and things? - Yeah. I... You know, I'd just like to have him harp at me one more time, you know. Because it was... It was... You know, it was a different relationship. - Yeah. - Yeah. Sounds like you might have been his favorite. Yeah, but I was always... I was also his, you know, biggest... - The recipient of his criticism. - Re... Oh, yeah. Yeah, he wasn't a complimentary person, you know. He believed in me, but he would bark. He would, you know. When did he ever...? Was there a time he was, like...? Last time I saw him, I was borrowing... Getting my 200 bucks from him. And those people I was going to see, I don't even know who they are now. Yeah. So I wish I was... Walked back and went, "You know what?" How you doing?" Sit down and talk with him. And that was a... Yeah, I should've cared more and been there more. I said, "Bring my flowers now while I'm living." Because I won't need your love When I'm gone Bring them flowers now, when I'm living I don't wanna need your love when I'm gone Don't waste time, tears or money On my breathless body If your heart is in them flowers Bring 'em on That's it. Got it. - Hi. - Hi. I mean... I got this verse for you. I think if I give you this first verse and I got the chords to the chorus, that you should knock out the rest of it. Just by telling me stories and I'll help them make them rhyme. So let's go like... Or maybe you already know how they rhyme. Hell, no. Bring those flowers now, while I'm living Because I don't wanna need your love When I'm gone Don't waste time, tears or money On my breathless body Breathless. Breath... Breathless body. Don't waste time, tears or money -On my old breathless body -My old breathless body - Body. - Body. Yeah. If your heart is in them flowers Bring 'em on This is all from your stories. You say, "All those miles have cast a long shadow. I'd take a couple back if I could." You told me that if you had spent not so much time on the road with Layla maybe it'd be a little easier to get through to her. "I'd learn to play guitar," which is your biggest regret. On that guitar he spent the last dime on, you know? - Yeah. - Gibson, the guitar. And tell your daddy more that you loved him. I know you wished that would have been your last interaction. "But I believe that, for the most part, I've done good." Because you have. You just have. - Hi. - They say that the difference between an artist and a successful artist is audacity. Yeah. Would you say your dad gave you your audacity? Oh, yeah. Never give up. My dad looked across the table at me when I was about 9 years old and we were living in Willcox, Arizona. And he says, "Tanya, do you wanna live here and get married and stay here for the rest of your life in Willcox? Or do you wanna go be a star?" "Daddy, that's not much of a choice. I wanna be a star." - Sure. - He picked up the whole family and moved. We got in the car and went to Las Vegas and spent six hours in the studio. I did the "Put Your Hand in the Hand of the Man" and "For the Good Times,""Proud Mary," "I'm so Lonesome I Could Cry." Hear that lonesome whippoorwill He sounds too... And I remember sitting there in the car with him. He said, "To the left is L.A. and to the right is Nashville. Which way you wanna go?" "Make a right." You know. He did a lot of things that I can't imagine somebody doing now. But he opened the doors. He didn't just open them, he kicked them down. You know, when I was in the middle of it, my mother was sort of in the background, but I realized later when I got older how really important that background was, you know. My mother always would say: "Have a soft heart." You know, "Don't let people harden you." My dad was a very strong, determined man that was kind of gambling her life and his life, their future, on me. I asked my mother... After I had kids, I think, looked at my 9-year-old going, "No, I couldn't do that." You know, just gamble all my future on this kid right here. - Yeah. - And I said, "What made you follow him? I mean, not go like, 'What, are you crazy?'" And she goes, "Honey, your daddy believed in you, and I believed in him." I love you. We love you. So, what's the plan here? - She's supposed to be here any second. - Waiting for Tanya. - Hey! - Hey! - How are you? - Hey, guys, gals. - I'm good. I'm doing pretty good. - All right. - I'm a little better. - Sweet. I had my little Adderall, so I'm feeling better. - Ready to focus? - Yeah. Yeah, because I could not before. All right, so the first song on there is... On that CD y'all gave me. What was it? - "Winner's Game." - "Winner's Game." And love You know me. I gotta change the lyrics. - Little details on there. - Okay. A lot of space in this one. You know, none of those... lyrics that kind of trip us all up. It's like: -Love is a winner's game -Winner's game And you can do it any rhythm you want. You know, love is a winner's game No one to thank and no one to blame Ain't always easy to play by the rules When you start keeping score That's when you lose I tell you, love is a winner's game And some say death Is just our cause for sinning Some see the end Some see the beginning We'd find our way through the joy And the pain of love Oh, love Love is a winner's game - Yes! - Cool. Oh, love Love is a winner's game Yeah, right? I mean, that's gotta be one of her best songs yet. That was awesome. God. She's gorgeous. Look at those eyes. So Tanya Tucker is Mama's favorite singer since I was a little girl. Grandma Teresa and me used to sing all Tanya Tucker songs. It was really special. So this is a really special time. It's very special. That's my wife right there. Come on, Catherine. - Hi. Nice to see you. - Hi. Nice to meet you. Pleasure. Yeah. - You met this little one? - Oh, my gosh. - Isn't she cute? - Gosh, she's just... I'd say put her in the movies if it wouldn't screw her up, you know? - I've thought about that. - Yeah. Tanya, let me ask you about some of your young life. - Are you happy? - Yeah. I am. Most the time, when I'm not tired. Or when I'm not very busy, I really like to... You know, I'm happy. - You're the best. - Thank you. Wanna buy the record? Thank you. It's a hard life sometimes, but everybody says, "You're young, you can take it." But that's not really true, you know? Just because you're young, it doesn't mean you can hold up as much as an older person. You know, I don't think... I don't wanna think that she's growing up, you know? I wanna keep her young and small. "Tanya, there's no reason to beat around the bush any longer. I might as well tell you that I'm in love with you and I'm asking you to reply to my marriage proposal. Sorry to shock you, but I believe to getting to the point about everything." - Well, he did. - Did he really? "Please answer soon. My heart is throbbing." That's sweet, but gee, I'm a little young. Not good enough. - That's great. - Happy birthday - Fantastic. - Dear Tanya Happy birthday to you I'm the one supposed to be singing. - Yeah! - Thank you. I think that I'm kind of all different kind of people rolled up in one because I change from day to day. I like to consider myself as the entertainer on-stage and then when I come off-stage, I'm just a regular person, you know? The one who said she'd rather be alone If you could only hear me now Like, if I got my Levi's and tennis shoes on, I'm a little girl. Then if I'm on-stage and I sing, I try to put a lot of feeling in my songs. When you change, what do you become? You become a sophisticated woman? Yeah, lots of times if I... Depends on how I'm dressed. And then if I want to, I become just a little kid. - A little kid. - Yeah. Did your dad stay involved with your career, like manage you? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - For how long? When did he hang it up and go, "All right, Tanya..." - He didn't. Never did. No. - He never did, huh? - Right up until 2006? - Never did. Never did. He took me everywhere he thought could possibly get me started. So this guy was... I don't... Can't remember his name or anything. But he took my dad and my mother in the office and he said, "Listen." He said, "I'm gonna right you a check right now." He wrote a $50,000 check. And he said... He handed it to my dad, he goes, "Here you go. I wanna manage your daughter." But he said, "I don't want no daddy involved." And my dad looked at him, he took the check and just went... and just walked out. My mother, of course: - $50,000... - "What are you doing?" - What was that? Like, how old were you? - I was 11. So this was $50,000. That was like a lot of money. - Yeah. Especially when you ain't got none. - Yeah. In fact, especially when you're... On the way there, my dad stopped at a gas station because we're out of gas and he told the guy, "I got a brand-new jack in the back. If you fill that tank up, I'll give you that brand-new jack." And the guy said, "You got it." So he filled up the tank and we went on to the meeting and $50,000 would have been real nice, you know. And then just before that, - he traded one of his tools for gas. - Yeah. Yup. - And then ripped up a $50,000 check? - Yeah, yeah. He had balls. - He knew what was best for you. - He had balls of steel. Was it protectiveness or you...? Also, at one point, they wanted to change my name. They didn't want Tanya. They wanted to change it to Tammy. Tammy Tucker. And my dad said, "Hell, no. Her name is Tanya and that's the way it's staying." If I could just come in, I swear I'll If I could just come in, come in, I swear Hey, guys, can I get the proper lyrics to "The House That Built Me"? They're lying around there somewhere. I got one here, Tanya, where I wrote in our changes. Okay. And then they're printing one out for you without all these scratches on it. So it'll be... Right. And then you can do whatever you wanted too. I really doubt I'm gonna get a vocal on this today. Don't worry about it. One, two, three. They leave home Move on And you do the best you can Lost in this whole world - I'm not retaining much right now. - You're doing great. You're doing great. Yeah, I just need to get it where I can learn it and come back and nail it. I know they say you can't go Okay. Plans were drawn, concrete poured And nail by nail, board by board But once the kids were grown Shit. Two, three, four. I thought If I could touch this place or feel it This brokenness inside me Might start healing - First one is not good, though. - It is. I thought if I... I thought... - It's so good, Tanya. - Pitch there. So now you're gonna punch us in. That very last line she just did was so well-timed. We'll use that one, Shooter, - as the one she hears. - Okay. Maybe I can find myself Ma'am, if I could walk around I swear I'll leave Won't take nothing but a memory From the house that built me They leave home, they move on Then you do the best you can I got lost in this old world And forgot who I am - Smoking. - We got it. Yup, she's done. The king of rock 'n' roll was born today. What would he have been, 85? Yeah, I'm getting a little dry. - Little dry in there? I thought so. - Oh, Elvis's birthday today. So let me send a... "Happy birthday, baby," out to him. - Happy birthday, Elvis. - Elvis, Elvis. Ain't nothin' but a hound dog Crying all the time Ladies and gentlemen, Tanya Tucker. A lot of people have branded me as female Elvis. I think that's neat. Because how much higher can you get? Yeah, Elvis is the biggest. Can't get any bigger. I've been wearing suits like the "Delta Dawn" suit and wearing dresses. Because that's what all the other girls wore. So then I decided, am I gonna be like the other girls or am I gonna be different? And I decided I wanna be different. And my dad wants me to be different. He's, "If you're gonna be different, you can't wear these long dresses and stuff and pant suits and all that." I said, "What are we gonna do?" So I went shopping one day. I found this one suit. It's a black suit. So I bought it. And I can also imitate Elvis in that suit. I can't imitate him in a dress. And I can't do songs like "Burning Love" in a dress. I can't just get up on stage and stand still. I can never do that. The power that he had in concert... not really envied, but I really desired. I enjoyed all those early years, but not too many years after that, it sort of got distorted a little bit. Do you wanna be the talk of the town again, like having engagements you have to say yes or no to? - I toss and turn with that sometimes. - Yeah. Do I want this? Sometimes I have a battle with it. Yeah. I feel like the people that are most successful always feels successful no matter what's going on. Because if they're doing what they love... No. - You don't. What do you feel like? - Very rarely ever love it. - Really? - Right, yeah. - Do you love this? - Yes. - Do you love playing live? - Rarely. I don't think I've ever come off stage... Maybe one or two times in my whole life and went, "Well, that was good." It's interesting because you've inspired generations of people. What's your mama's name, child? What's your mama's name? What's your mama's name, child? What's your mama's Name? - Did you think "I sound so different"? - I didn't. I didn't think about that much. Because you weren't, like, maybe that little yelp of Connie's... I can see that, but there just wasn't much else mimicking. Connie and Loretta was the ones I really... I can hear Tammy sometimes too. - Can you? - Yeah. Yeah. She was something. She's good. Because your good girl's gonna go bad I'm gonna be the swinginest swinger You ever had If you like them painted up Powdered up Then you ought to be glad Because your good girl's gonna go bad Shit. Good times. - All right, let's see if I can... - All right. - I don't know. - I can do this all day. - I know. - All day long I can listen to you talk. I'd have learned to play guitar And tell my daddy more I loved him But I believe that for the most part I've done good Yeah, Tanya, that's good. There's always sunrise And rainbows and babies And the little things I cherish on the way And even though someday They'll bury me and Jesse Ray I believe we're gonna ride again someday Bring my flowers now while I'm living I won't need your love when I'm gone Don't spend time, tears or money On my old breathless body If your heart is in them flowers Bring 'em on If your heart is in them flowers Bring 'em on Did I tell you the story about... In Henderson, Nevada, we pulled up to this "Trailer Estates," it was called. - It was a trailer park, but... - "Trailer Estates," - that's gonna be the name of my next band. - Trailer Estates. Trailer Estates. - That's the title of your next album. - That's it. - Tanya Tucker, Trailer Estates. - Trailer Estates. And we pulled up in front of it, and it had a "for sale" sign out front. And we moved in. - Right then and there? - Then and there. And I was 11. We were watching a movie one night and was watching the credits, and my dad said, "Hey, that woman right there..." It was the credits for the songs. "That woman right there lives in Las Vegas." I've heard her name because he's been out and about trying to get me started. Her name was Dolores Fuller, and she wrote a lot of Elvis's movie songs. - Okay. - And so I said, "Let's call her." And my dad said, "She's probably got an unlisted number." I said, "There's a phone... We got a phone book with this place. It come with this place. So let's look it up." And we looked in the phone book and she was listed. So he called her. She said there's one guy we gotta get, Billy Sherrill. We're gonna meet with him. We signed one of those little two-bit contracts that they give everybody. And me and Billy sat in the office and listened to material people would bring it in. And I started figuring out that this guy... - Had some power. - He's a pretty powerful kind of guy. I read that when you were 13 years old going through your first stack of songs, you ran across a song called "Happiest Girl in the Whole U.S.A." I'm the happiest girl in the whole U.S.A. You turned it down and you picked a song called "Delta Dawn," which is a much more complex adult-type song. Why wouldn't a 13-year-old pick up "Happiest Girl in the Whole U.S.A."? It's... Now that you asked me that, I've pondered that several times, thinking: "There I was sitting in Billy Sherrill's office with Al Gallico and all these people. Al brings in a song, "Happiest Girl in the Whole U.S.A," and I said, you know, "No, I don't like it." And they go, "Oh, she don't like it." The girl's got a choice, right? But the next day, we were by ourselves and he said, "You know, I heard a song." Played "Delta Dawn," and it started out, you know: She's 41 And I thought, "Well, that's my song." She's 41 And her daddy still calls her "baby" All the folks around Brownsville Say she's crazy Because she walks downtown With a suitcase in her hand Looking for a mysterious dark-haired man In her younger days They called her Delta Dawn Prettiest woman you ever laid eyes on Then a man of low degree stood by her side And he promised her He'd take her for his bride Delta Dawn What's that flower you have on? Could it be a faded rose From days gone by? And did I hear you say He was meeting you here today To take you to his mansion in the sky? Yeah. Goddamn, man. That is the shit. I mean, I've been singing with you now for a while, like, being in this booth and watching you come in and, like, know one like that and hit it out of the park was insane. Well, my voice is not awake yet. - Oh, good, man. - It's like... Because I sing... It's my last song in the set, you know. And by that time, my voice is a little lubricated. I don't know if that's the best idea. That's a good idea. Okay. - You think? - Yeah. Oh, yeah. You would know. Oh, shit. Bottoms up. - And she goes, "Hair of the dog." - All right, here we go. I had a fucking headache every day I've been with you. Last thing you wanted was another drink. God dog it. Well, all right. Bottoms up, bitches. I'm not tough enough for this. She's terrified. She tried everything she could think of to get out of this. It's been weeks of trying to convince Tanya to come here and listen to this. And she will never admit she's scared about it, but I feel like... She just... Is... Has all kinds of hesitation about what this moment and what this movement means in her life, and I think it's a really beautiful thing to see somebody that strong showing vulnerability in the way she is around this project. - Hi, baby. - Hey, beautiful. So good to see you. All we care about is making Tanya happy and helping her have the good life and the respect she deserves for the work that she's done for us. And that's why... 100% why we're here, because God knows there ain't no fucking money in it. Let me have some of that. You can't have it all. You look nice. - I'm sending Jimmy with me. - Yeah. Oh, hey! Oh, my God, my hero. - My little Waylon. - Yeah. Oh, I'm so happy to see you too. - How are you? - Oh, I'm so happy. - This is my mom. - Oh, my God. - Mom, Tanya Tucker. - Oh, my God. - Nice to meet you. - Come on, Mom. Your song you used to sing: I'm going down -To my last teardrop this time -Last teardrop this time - It's true. - Baby, I'm down to my last - This is the reason Brandi loves me. - Yup. - Don't grab the mic cord. - Right here, Mama. So what's this I hear about you don't like the word "comeback"? - No, no. - Why don't you like it? Tell me. Because that's been beaten to death. Every time it's a comeback. I like "relaunch" better. - Relaunch? - Yeah, relaunch. - Everybody loves a comeback. - It's a relaunch. Yeah, but I've come back so much, they don't believe it no more. - This time it's happening. - Yeah. I'll tell you right now that I played it for my mom and for Jesse Dayton. I don't know if you know him. But the reaction that I've gotten every time is like, wow, this reminds me of the early records of yours in a way. There's extra chairs. Feel free to pull them up and set them wherever you guys want. Get comfy. It's great to have you all here. Especially great to meet you. - Mama T, the original Mama T. - Yes. You are about to do a really brave thing. There's been a bit of time and space that's gone by and you've hit different rough patches in your life, your dad passed, you've struggled with substance, and here you are, ready to do some real truth-telling and what you have is a town right now that is waiting for a matriarch. And it's not about glossing anything up, it's about doing the opposite of that. And I think part of that really resonates with you too. So let's hit it. You guys might recognize this one, but we changed the lyrics to make it a... different perspective. I know they say... Oh, shit. I'm going. You're fine, T. - No, no. No, no, no. - You're not. I just had to come back one last time - It's gonna suck. I know it is. - No, it isn't. No, it's great. Ma'am I know you don't know me from Adam Oh, fuck. But these hand prints On the front steps are mine Up those stairs In that little back bedroom Is where they did their homework And learned to play guitar And I bet you didn't know Underneath that live oak It's fucking great. My favorite dog is buried in the yard I thought if I could touch this place Or feel it This brokenness inside me Might start healing Out here it's like I'm someone else I thought that maybe I could find myself If I could just come in I swear... - And that's it. - What the hell? Yes, ma'am. - Oh, no. - Yeah. - No. - Cheers, babe. Do we have your blessing to move forward with all this? Yeah, but I just think I should maybe punch that one line. - Which one are you talking about? - In "Laredo." You have a way that you wanna do it? - Just the last one. - What is it you don't like? Keep on running - You wanna kind of go up. - I wanna go up on the last one. - You know... - You know? This album is a little bit more like... If we do another album, you can punch the hell out of it. - Okay. - I wanna tell you something. This album is like a photograph where you can't go back and change what you were wearing because you don't like bell-bottoms. You can't go back and change the picture. You just can't. It happened and it happened, and we just... If we ever did anything to it, it wouldn't be the same studio, wouldn't be the same microphone, the same mood. - I'm there. I'm good. - It's fucking perfect, T. We're taking it all the way. Can I run with it? All right. - Okay, run with it. - Okay. - The new CD just came out. - Today. While I'm Livin'. - Don't wait 17 years to give us new music. - No, I didn't want to... For a while there, I didn't really know if I wanted to do any more. Are you excited about this week? Like, are you nervous? Like, what's it like? The amount of attention it's getting is... I can't really wrap my head around it yet. You know, I'm 60 years old, so it's like, wow, what...? Why now? - Right. - You know? Thank you. See you all later. You two have such chemistry. I can see it with the two of you. Why was it so important to you? You're really instrumental in making this project happen. Why? She's crazy. - Something ain't right. - What was your experience of Brandi leading up to your meeting? No. I... Actually, I'd never heard Brandi. - I'd never heard of her. - She had no idea who I was. Which does not... Which does not mean anything. At one point, Shooter... She's not the best with texting. - No. - At one point, Shooter texted me and he's like, "Brandi meet Tanya, Tanya meet Brandi." She didn't know she was texting me, she was texting him... - "Who is this chick?" - "Who is this Brandi bitch?" Say that again. "Who the hell is this Brandi bitch?" she says on the text thread. I was talking to Brandi, and Brandi really considers you an outlaw. Sometimes I don't hear your name get mentioned with these icons. Yeah, me either. Well, why do you think that is? Oh, I don't know. If I were to pay attention every time my name wasn't mentioned, I'd be upset all the time. I think what it made me is I kind of went against the norm. I moved out to California and was 18. That was Glen Campbell years. So it all just kind of snowballed. Do you feel you are now at a turning point in your career that you're leaving behind now the teenage years and the little girl who became the singer at the age of 13 and going into a maturing process in terms of how the public perceives you and what you do for them? I think so. I think not only in my career but my personal life as well. He was already a major star when she was still in kindergarten. Now Tanya Tucker is 22 years old. Glen Campbell is 44. And it's that 20-year age difference that's caused a lot of gossip about their relationship. I enjoy Tanya very much. I have a lot of fun with her because I think she's... Well, she's crazy about me. In the '70s, you were the leader of the pack out in Los Angeles. You had more than your share of fun. - 1980 you met Glen Campbell. - Yes. You both had an affection for cocaine. Well, it... I kind of grew into that later. Not before I met Glen. I felt it's my time to let loose. And I went for it. And I got a name. I got a reputation that followed me. When did you realize, "I'm in trouble here"? It was about two years ago. It was several of my friends and my family. And they did a intervention. I went through my wild oats like anybody else does. Just happened to go through them on the cover of the Enquirer. - Thank you for coming tonight. - Thank you. Now, I know I'm getting into trouble here... It's been a hell of a year for you, hasn't it? - You're already in trouble. - I know I'm in trouble. You came to me, you were upset when you came out here. - Oh, well, I was joking with you. - Come on. All right. It's been a hell of a year, hasn't it? A hell of a year, a heck of a year. Sorry, Daddy. A lot of people come to see you in personal appearances not only because they admire your music and your performance, but they have great curiosity about you because of what they read in the tabloids and the pulp sheets and the rags. - Don't you think? - I don't believe that. I think people that read those magazines are not record buyers, first of all. I don't think they really... The majority-type thing is like... Well, I won't say the difference between one show and another, but your show... To be on your show sells records because people... A majority of people watch your show and it sells records. - You're really nervous, aren't you? - I'm not. Actually, I'm scared to death. No, TV makes me nervous. Well, really nervous. Anyway, so... I'm in rare form tonight, folks. Better enjoy it. No. The difference is those people don't buy records. You know, my voice is... - Tired? - Yeah. Tired, and it's about to give up on me. Hurry up and wait. Man, I gotta quit smoking. Shit, I hate... I hate the idea of having to quit smoking. - Because I like doing it so much. - Yeah? Fucking ain't got a choice, though. How much can you put in your lungs - before they finally go, "Fuck off!"? - Yeah. But it's really affected me. I think being tired was the most... The biggest thing, but... definitely has a lot to do with smoking too. Sure. So... I dread having to be disciplined about anything. You know, age will make you eventually have discipline, but... Hang on, just hang on for a minute I've got something to say I'm not asking you to move on or forget it But these are better days To be wrong all along and admit it Is not amazing grace But to be loved like a song you remember Even when you've changed Tell me, hey Did I go on a tangent? Did I lie through my teeth? Did I cause you to stumble on your feet? Did I bring shame on my family? Did it show when I was weak? When that's what you see, that will be me That will be me, yeah That will be me That will be me Mercy. Yeah! Dang, you guys. That's gonna be great, man. If your heart is in them flowers Bring 'em on If your heart is in them flowers Bring 'em on Ready for T. Waiting for T. Waiting on Tanya Tucker I'm gonna call Jerilyn and James, find out what's going on. This is an event for Loretta's birthday. And Loretta and Tanya are friends and Loretta has mentored and supported Tanya. There'll be a lot of amazing people there. Everybody from Miranda Lambert to Kacey Musgraves, Garth Brooks, you name it. A lot of people coming out to tribute Loretta. Tanya will be the only one singing an original song. A song that she wrote with Loretta in her mind and in her heart. So it's quite significant in that sense. Also the only one singing without the house band. So it's gonna be profound and just very real and raw, like this album. So it's, in a way, Tanya stepping out in front of one of her heroes and in front of this town and saying, "I'm back and I'm ready to reveal myself in a new way." And there's all these people that are watching, that have been a part of Tanya's past, good and bad, that are wondering: "Is she gonna make it? Is she gonna come out and do this?" And so no big deal. I don't like to be surprised. I can't even open my birthday presents in front of other people. Tanya's like a constant birthday present. I've thought about it so many times, like, should Tanya take media training? Should she talk to somebody about...? I was telling Miranda Lambert, "You know, Tanya, she's a real wild card. I never know what she's gonna say, it makes me really nervous." She's like, "At some point", you have to accept Tanya Tucker's fucking crazy and you can't control what she says, that's what we all love about her. Just deal with it." Takes a drink, and I was like, "Okay, I think at some point I'm gonna have to understand that Tanya Tucker's crazy, in the best possible way that a person can be crazy." And maybe I was put into this project to force me out of this rigidity that I have around being fearful about what people are gonna do and say. T.T. here? No? - Not yet. - Not yet, huh? What time do I gotta leave, Ike? 5:30? - We should... The latest 5:45. - Okay. - I mean, I'm pissed. - Yeah. She fucking knows I'm pissed. She knows the song. Because she's been singing and showing it off. Right. But you guys needed the time. So it... I had a bad feeling about it, so I specifically asked them not to put her on the official rehearsal. I said I'll rehearse her myself and then I'll come to the rehearsal. And don't worry, she'll be rehearsing tomorrow. Because if she had been even 15 minutes late to the official rehearsal, she'd throw off the whole timeline in the day and then rumors would start. - The rumors wanna start anyway. - Oh, I know. I never worry about a performance when she gets there. If she can get there, she'll be the best thing since sliced bread. - Yeah. - She'll kill it. I'm 90% sure you're right, but I'm 10% so protective of her in this next phase of her life that we cannot put her on stage at the Bridgestone Arena unless I hear it and it's perfect. It's all on me, this one. I called this one in and if she... I mean, I'll tell everybody she's sick, I'll do anything, except for have her stand up there and forget the lyrics. She just text me going, "I don't fucking know, but you're pissing me off." So my response is, "Fucking good." I'll just go to my rehearsal. Call me, and if she's in a good state of mind and it can happen, then I'll come back. If she's not, we'll pull her from the show and we'll protect her from making a fool of herself. Okay, I'm gonna go to my rehearsal. Sorry I'm late, guys. That secret extra. - Extra, you know. - Yeah. - Hey, T. - Hey, babe. I'm so sorry. It's all right. - One thing after the other. - It's all right, T. But you know... Yeah, oh, no. I was like, "I really wanna be late, yes, I do." - No, no, no. - For your first big thing? - I'm ready. I'm ready. - Okay, I'm ready too. - Are you afraid of tomorrow night? - No. - No? - Am I supposed to be? - I don't know. - I'm talking about just normal. - I'm afraid of tomorrow night. - Oh, shit. Okay, she planted the seed. - Now it's planted... - It's all right. I'm going to damn sit on that egg and go... Are y'all ready for this? - Yeah, it's good. - Bad reputation's made me a good living. "Made me a damn good living." That's what she said. It sounds great, Bran. Nothing to worry about there. - Yeah. You got it? - Yeah. But it is a big night. All the things I've been running my mouth about for the last five months are happening, like right now. Yeah. Here, here? No, like by 2 or 3 in the afternoon. This is the kind of stuff I want in my horse stalls. Just like this. Look, my Lee press-on nails look pretty good, don't they? Calling on T.T. to the stage. Hi. Hi, y'all. I've got your picture That you gave to me And it's signed with love Just like it used to be The only thing different The only thing new I've got your little things She's got you You sang your ass off. - Well. She ain't got one no more. - Cool, man. Shit. Lookit, my hands are shaking. I'm a nervous piano player, I'll get it right. I'm a nervous singer. I'm a nervous wreck. - How's that? - If I'm singing, I'm good. If I'm trying to back you up, that scares me. - Oh, hell, no. - It's good to be scared. - Well... - And I'm scared. Yeah, me too. I think I got you beat. Oh, it goes... So if you got love Then you're sitting on a gold mine And you can't take it with you when you go This one here. So don't wait, help your sister Forgive your brother and your neighbor We all think Yeah, that's the one. It comes in a little earlier, didn't it? I mean, than the other one. - No, it's exactly the same time. - One more time. Forgive your brother and your neighbor We all think, yeah, we got the time Until we don't Your voice sounds good. - Why does it sound so good today? - I have no idea. What did you do? Steroid shot in your ass? I'm fixing to, though. You don't need it. You sound crazy good. - Okay. - You sounded great too. I ain't never heard that song sung like that ever. - Thank you. - Ever. I'm comfortable, like, doing that. Like, I can do that. I can do the vocal aerobics, and the throw down thing, but it's this, like we're saying something that really means something and I don't wanna screw this up. Like, I don't wanna be the one... I'm just terrified. Well, you're gonna fine because it's gonna be perfect. All there is to it. Well, I was born a coal miner's daughter I feel like I've been carrying her since we started this thing and tonight, she's actually more prepared for... I think to do this than I am. - She's gonna be carrying me. - Oh, she totally will be. - A little bit. - I can just tell. Socials. I get to introduce another legend that would like to sing a special song. Somebody that you might love very much and find familiar. The great Tanya Tucker. Thank you so much. Happy birthday, my girlfriend. My hero. I love you. Bring my flowers now, while I'm living I won't need your love when I'm gone Don't spend time, tears or money On my old breathless body If your heart is in them flowers Bring 'em on All the miles Cast a long shadow I'd take a couple back if I could I'd have learned to play guitar Told my daddy more I loved him But I believe, for the most part I done good There's always sunrise And rainbows and babies And the little things I cherish on my way Even though one day They'll bury me and Jesse Ray I just know we're gonna ride again someday I could not be happier with that. Could you see the people's eyes? I was looking. He told me to look at everyone's eyes. So I did. - Oh, shit. - I'm looking in people's eyes. You have a way, man. You open your mouth and it's like... silent. Even when you're telling your stories, it's like you gotta know that you're sanctioned. Like, you have something. But you've always known that, but you have something from another place. It's a real thing. Well, I'm happy that it's transferring. Because I tell you what, for three minutes that song was, about 3:15? - Yeah. - It was heaven. Was it? - That's what it's gonna be like. - It was heaven. So the label... We went for dinner last night. First, they were overwhelmed with how great yesterday went. - Awesome. - So the second thing is we gotta talk about strategy for this record. To make sure everybody hears it. Every time we talk about strategy, I'm pulled back into the Rick Rubin... direction with American Recordings and the stuff that he did for Cash around that, you know? Johnny Cash did like a House of Blues, Viper Room, Mercury, Bowery-type tour. - Right. - It just was like, "Oh, my God. Did you get tickets to the Johnny Cash show? Place only holds 400 people." This music will lend itself to that, people feel it's intimate and lovely. The truth about Tanya's hard ticket game is that she might only be able to sell 500 tickets. So selling out a 400-seat club makes it look like she could have sold 2,000 tickets, you know. We all do it. We all do it to, like, help pay for the cost of the road and stuff. It's not like Tanya can never go into a casino again, it's just that, like, if you do more hip, perception-based gigs than casino gigs, then you're gonna change that. - Yeah. - Yeah, and we... Optics on what Tanya Tucker does on the road. But it's gonna be meager for a while, like, hard to make ends meet. Yeah. We are all in. And we looked at each other and said, "Are we insane?" - We're gonna find out. - If you're insane, we're all insane. We're all insane, so... But we believe. And shit, you know, music does this to us. Show me the pictures, the ones we chose. No, first... - Last one's a charm. - Here we go. - The only thing I worry about. The... - Oh, never mind. You're talking about the camel toe? - That camel toe rules. - You wanna leave the camel toe? - Don't take that thing out. - Okay. Man, when you can rock a camel toe, you are like a boss bitch. - But... - She said to leave the camel toe. Okay, here's what Brandi says: "What new songs should we learn for these shows coming up and what old songs should we do of mine?" She says, "Well, you can't go wrong, people love 'What's Your Mama's Name, '" 'Delta, "Strong Enough," Last Teardrop.' An acoustic version of 'Two Sparrows' will rip folks to bits. "I can't wait to see one." You know, I come from the Elvis, you know... thing. I told them that last night. So you know: - You know? - An introduction, yeah. And I'm talking about, you know... - And then you go out singing something... - Great. Oh, see, C.C. rider Right. So, I got that Elvis syndrome going on. I don't have the Neil Young syndrome, where you go out and just walk out on stage and go, "Hi, everybody." And go into: Old man, take a look at my life And then do a bunch of songs that I've never heard in my life. - If it makes you... - And I'm bored to death. If it makes you uncomfortable to do that, then start with "Trouble" and then go into those. If "Trouble" gives you a comfort zone, start with it. 'Cause that's what you gotta warm up your vocal with anyway, basically. Yeah. I'd move like... "A Little Too Late" up. - Up where? - After "Stroll." It's a fast-tempo song and another fast-tempo song. Right, but don't you want to have your newer ones before that? I'm 60, you know. - I know you're 60. - I gotta get my breath. So, this is what I came up with. Okay, that's what I came up with last night. "Blood Red." - "Jamestown Ferry." - Yeah, yeah. -"What's Your Mama's Name,""Lay With Me," -Yeah. "Don't Bleed My Heart" and "Stand Another Year." Yeah. I'm getting cold chills. Yeah. And then "Strong Enough to Bend," "Lizzie." - Say, hi, Uncle Craig. - Hey, baby. - And then go into the new stuff. - Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. "This is what I am. You don't like that, you can get your ass out right now." - They'll love it. - I know it. - "Hello, I'm Tanya fucking Tucker." - I know it. I know. I'm gonna tell you how it's gonna be You're gonna give your loving to me Love lasts more than one day Tanya Tucker's new album is TNT, and it's her most dynamic, most exciting, and most explosive one yet. I wanted to bring country music to a new level. And these people didn't know how to do it. And it kind of bit me in the you-know-what. I wanted to be a singing entertainer. And I told my dad, I said, "They think we're still in horse and buggy down here in Nashville." It was Charlie Douglas. Big, you know, DJ in New Orleans. He called every major radio guy and said, "No, don't play Tanya Tucker, man. She's left country music. She's betrayed us." When you started, there was no real place you could look for direction. And what you were doing, you were what, 12, 13? - Oh, yeah. - And no one had really done that. - No. No one available. - No. - Not in our business. - No. - You were the one. You took chances. - Right. I don't like to be called a country singer. Not to offend anybody, I rather be called a singer because when they call you a country singer, or you're a rock singer, they're limiting you. - Right. - And I can do anything. I feel like I can sing rock or country. Can you remind me to tell Jodi to have a bottle of tequila up there? On my table? I just wish everybody'd get really drunk. So then they would... not know how bad I'm gonna be. Do you think I should put... Take this out. And put in "Texas," or... - I thought I'd do it. - Take what out? "Little Too Late." Yeah, I would. I'd do "Texas." Instead of "Little Too Late"? Well, you asked me. - I know. - Yeah. I'm trying to shorten this motherfucker, not lengthen it. A woman's life ain't just a list Of the bad Of the bad things she has done All I can say is, I'm glad there's a teleprompter up there. The problem is, can I read it? - Tanya, are you on there? - Hi, darling. Hi, baby. How are you? Oh, I'm a little tired, but I'm here. - I wish you was here. - Where you at? I'm at the Exit/In in Nashville. Oh, in Nashville? Getting ready to go on. Oh, my goodness. - I love you, honey. - I love you so much, - and I... - You know you're my number one. Well, you're my number one, you know that. Oh, I love you, Retti. We love you. No over-singing. Remember, it's just Nashville. Lot of real good friends of mine in the house tonight. I want to say thank you to all of them, and of course I want to say thank you to Brandi Carlile. How about it for my daughter and Spencer? Reverie Lane. Thank you all for being here. When I die, I may not go to heaven I don't know if they let cowboys in If they don't, just let me go to Texas 'Cause Texas is as close as I've been Help us out. When I die I may not go to heaven Come on! I don't know if they let cowboys in If they don't Just let me go to Texas with y'all 'Cause Texas is as close as I've been Okay, so, it's been since 2002 that you've made new music. 17 years, yeah. So, 17 years. I mean, there are human beings driving now that were born 17 years ago. Why did you wait so long? I think maybe there's two answers to that, but the one that comes to the top of my head would be... You know, after losing my parents, you know, I really kind of lost my mojo. And I just thought... I didn't have a manager, didn't want one, because I couldn't imagine anybody managing me but my dad. So, I went through a lot of things. So, me and my daughter got in a three-horse slant-load trailer with my Ford truck and we just started, you know, just being gypsies. And that worked for a little while. And then Merle Haggard called me and said, "What are you doing?" I go, "Well, I don't think I'm gonna do it no more. I think I'm done doing it." He goes, "You can't do that. You've got to get back out there and you gotta get to doing what you do the best." Okay. Time check, ten minutes. I'm nervous this is all gonna be for nothing. Should I make myself a blessing To everyone I meet And when you fall I will get you on your feet Did I spend time with my family Here we are! - Here we are. - T.T.? Let's get started.

And you'll be sitting there with me. - Right by your side. - Yeah. - Hey, guys. - Hey. Well, we got stuck. Did you have to get him out? - Good. How are you? - Good. This is so pretty.

It's mighty fine. I just poured like $75 in there. We need a race. - Hey, you wanna race? - Wanna race. We got stuck on the hill. Yeah! Have you ever been nominated for a Grammy outside of country? I have no idea. The first one, I was 14, though. I remember that. Are you kidding me? But you still haven't won one. Crazy. I don't know a better loser anywhere. Did you think this would happen? No, I had no clue. - You had no clue? - Nope. We knew it would happen. We knew it the whole time, from the first day. It's a... Thank you guys all, for having the vision, driving around in your cars, listening to my music, - Googling me. - Thank you. - And I love you. - I love you too. Brandi, I love you too. Goddang talented gal. Go down every avenue you can. Oh, yeah, there we go. Amazing. It looks good. That looks great. Nice bum! Great. I love it, guys. I know who that's for. - Mom and Daddy. - Look at that, it's my parents. - Right there on your arm. - Named Beau and Juanita. Isn't that awesome? - And look at that. - So this is "Two Sparrows in a Hurricane." Oh, gosh! One flip of the hat, you change your whole attitude, you know? Hi, y'all. I'm Brandi. Is there anything you'd like to say before we get this day started? Shall we open the champagne? Too early. What is your inner thoughts right now? My inner thoughts are... that someone said I should... get four pieces of paper, since I'm up for four awards... and kind of write a... A different kind of thing for every award. - And that... - Don't forget that. I want to thank Brandi and Shooter for having a vision that I did not have. A vision of my future, that my music could be important in my future, not just my past. Yeah. I want to say something like, "Awards are..." I'm not really... I'm not used to getting any awards. If it wasn't for Brandi, I wouldn't be here. I'm pretty sure. Hey, Brandi. Oh, man, I'm running around like a one-legged man in an ass-kicking contest. Tryin' to get my shit together for today. I was callin' to see how you were feelin'. Well, I'm a lot better. By the grace of God. So I took my last breathing treatment because it makes me nervous. - Oh, yeah? - That's the last thing I need to be. You got this. You got this. Lot of emotion floating around here. I wanna go around wanting to cry all the time and I don't even cry. You know what? It's good. That's all good. You guys have everything, correct? - Yep. - Shit. If she doesn't get one, this recognition, through an award, what more could have been done? - Okay. - Here's the other earring. Here. I'll get this. - Okay, that's good. - Good? Is Rod fixing my hair? Am I going out like this? He's coming. Where the hell is he? There. Where'd you go? Just trying to find superglue. Get somebody else. You're supposed to be doing my hair. There's a million people to do that shit. - Yeah, take it. - Okay. Here. - Can you hold this? - Yeah. - It's good. - Come on. Come on! It's all fun and good from here. - Yeah. - Let's rock and roll. Let's do this! No matter what happens... And everyone who voted to get you here cares. You look beautiful. Good luck. - Okay. - I got this. Right here. Right now, it is time for music's biggest night of the year. That's right. The Grammy Awards are finally here. Tanya Tucker is here. She has had quite a journey the last few years. Kind of doing nothing at all, and now she's suddenly back with multiple nominations for her first album of original music in 17 years. Happy Grammys day. Both huge nights for you guys! How are you feeling? I don't know how to say what I'm feeling. It's just... I'm overjoyed. For Best Country Song, a songwriter's award... And the Grammy goes to... "Bring My Flowers Now." Thank you. You know, after... almost 50 years in this business, after many dreams... and it's still unbelievable to me that I'd still have a few firsts left. So after 14 trips, 14 nominations, this is the first win, and I... I can't believe it. Me and Shooter asked Tanya why she hasn't made an album in almost 20 years, and she said it's because when her mom and her dad died, she just couldn't do it anymore. And that she thought that it meant there was more love behind her in her life than ahead of her, and she knows that's not true right now. - Thank you. - Thank you all! I feel like the gates are wide open for me to be able to do some of the things I know I'm capable of, but just never had the avenue. Couldn't find the right road. It's been a long, hard climb, but I'm sitting here at the edge of the hill still looking up at Mount Everest, and I finally got my hiking boots on and I'm ready to go. Someone was asking me about what I thought about this album, and I said, "Well, it's a beginning." Would you please make welcome to the stage of the Grand Ole Opry, Miss Tanya Tucker. I felt you calling I saw you start From the old town movies To the bars on the boulevard The bells were ringing For a gypsy soul Straight to the smart-mouth Little girl from Seminole All you outlaws and the Opry queens That wrapped those golden arms Around the baby of the family To stand beside you then Was more than enough I always was And always will be looking up So gather around now It's time to sing It's bittersweet But it's a hell of a silver lining I tell the same old stories Y'all get your wings And I get better every time I kiss a weathered cheek And watching doves fly Sooner than me I guess I'm ready Ready as I'll never be The snow don't fall on Willcox And the whip-poor-will don't lie Are the two things you can count on And if you blink You're gonna miss it twice Even if I saw it coming Even if I wanted to You're just going to the one place left That I can't follow you So gather around now It's time to sing It's bittersweet But it's a hell of a silver lining I tell the same old stories Y'all get your wings And I get better every time That I don't know Ain't no debts to repay Even if you're light years away May the circle be unbroken Let it breathe through you So one sweet day Whoa, happy day Gather around now It's time to sing It's bittersweet But it's a hell of a silver lining I tell the same old stories Y'all get your wings And I'll get better every time I kiss a weathered cheek And watching doves fly Sooner than me I guess I'm ready Ready as I'll never be I'm ready as I'll never be
