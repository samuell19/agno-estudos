What happened? Nice race, Danny. Hurt yourself, Danny? Stand away. What brought on this attack? Exertion. Did you let him enter that race? Listen. He begged me every day for a week. I thought it better for his morale. You are an idiot. But I never thought you'd allow a boy with severe asthma to go into a race. At this altitude. It wasn't Bill's fault, Miss Evans. I wanted to. I won, didn't I Bill. Go back to your business, Bill. I'll take care of him. I'll give him something to quiet him. Danny, I want you to be a brave little man. No. Not the needle. Please just give me a pill, but don't stick me with a needle. You need something that works faster, Danny. No. No, no. Last time, you promised me. I know I did, Danny. But I won't hurt you. No. No, no! Are you alright, sonny? Are you the kind that's been lost all night? Are you Danny Lambert? Hey. Everybody and his brother has been looking for you. The rangers, the scouts, campers. Come on, sonny. Come on. You've had a tough time. Can you walk? I hurt my leg but I can walk alright. Are you a ranger? No. I am not a ranger but I'll take care you, sonny. Come on. It was on the radio about you. Your dad came up to the hotel last night. Would you take me to him? Please, mister. Sure, sonny. We'll phone the rangers and they will come up in a jeep. Or maybe with horses. Come on. Let's keep going. It said on the radio that your daddy owns the Columbia Tyre & River Company. That's right. Do you live there? - Sometimes we live there. Then we have a house in Santa Barbara and one in Denver. You are a lucky boy. Your daddy is a very rich man. Mom can't travel much anymore. She has got a weak heart. They always have phones in these things. Come on, let's go. I don't want to, mister. Now listen, sonny. If I leave you down here you're just going to wander away again. Come on. I won't let you fall off. Up you go. Look, son. Don't worry. I'll be right behind you. I won't let you fall. Come on. Alright. In you go. Nah. They took the phone out. Sit down, kid. Rest. You must be almost worn out. Too bad there's no phone. Here, kid. Some crackers and jelly. Hungry? Take me to my daddy. That is just what I'm doing. Once I get word to the rangers they will be out here in an hour so. Now, you wait it out. Stay here and rest while I go for help. Okay? - Okay. You will hurry, won't you? - You bet I will. Now, you eat something and then take a nap. I don't know how far I will have to hike. It's an awful long way down to the ground there, isn't it. So don't you go out there. You might fall off. You just sit tight and I will be back. Okay? Mr Lambert, these things always seem very grave while they're happening. But nine times out of ten they turn out okay. Last summer, we had a little baby girl lost up here for three days and nights. She was found. Sleeping peacefully in a cranny in the rocks. Yes. I know. But Danny isn't well. He suffers from asthma attacks. He has been gone all night. I've had search parties out all night too. Look. Let's put on more men. Maybe someone with bloodhounds. I am willing to pay a substantial reward, Mr Erickson. We are paid, sir. This is all part of our job. We have handled these things before. I've got every available ranger out on search duty. It may take another hour or four or five. Or it may take all night. But I'm sure I'll have some good news for you shortly. Well, don't phone me at our rooms. My wife must not know of this. She isn't well. Alright, sir. I'll phone the desk and you call me back. Excuse me, please. Mr Lambert, there's a phone call for you. Thank you, son. I appreciate all that you are doing, Mr Erickson. That booth, sir. Thank you, son. - Thank you, sir. Yes? Hello? This is Robertson Lambert speaking. Mr Lambert. Now listen. Listen very, very carefully. Your boy isn't lost. He is safe. "And he's in good hands." "Say anything to anybody and you will never see him again." "Now feel under the shelf in your booth there. You will find an envelope." Have you seen a kid wandering around here anywhere? How old is the kid? - Eight or nine. Dark hair. Blue eyes. Wearing a Boys Camp uniform. The mountain rangers and he has got a bad case of asthma. Oh, the kid that's missing? No, I haven't seen him. But a bunch of scouts just went over that ridge there. Yeah. That is a search party. Just a minute please, doctor. I hope that is an emergency call. Yeah. It sure is. My partner fell climbing on the rocks. You want us to help? Where is your camp? - Comanche Lake. But it will be alright. You got all you can do finding that kid. You read that yet? Yes. "Can you make up that shipment?" Yes. I think so. My Denver office .. Just answer yes or no. "Can you get it together today?" I think so. If you need more time, take it. I don't want any slip-ups. No. No. I'll get it together today. The sooner my son is .. Shut up. Alright. Get it ready. Now, listen. Go to the Cliffhanger Bar. Sit at the table closest to the bridge at the south end. Be there from five onward tonight until you're contacted. "Got that?" Yes. Don't miss. Mr Lambert. Mr Lambert. Right here, son. I have a message for you. Go on. What is it? You're supposed to go and check your car in the parking lot. Thank you. Hey, what's that? Some knucklehead on a cycle. What goes up must come down. A pretty stupid place to take a ride. What's the idea? This is a foot trail. It is closed to vehicles. I was just doing a little cow-trailing. You know, you can get yourself killed off these cliffs. Let me have your identification. Mr Lambert. Come in. Mr Erickson. My son has been kidnapped. Kidnapped? How long have you known this? Since that phone call when we talked on the terrace yesterday morning. And I suppose you were warned not to report it? They threatened to kill Danny. They threatened to tell my wife. What would you have done? I paid them the money. I followed every order they gave me. They promised to release Danny this morning. They didn't tell me where. Driving up and down these roads looking .. I can't stand any more. Get me the FBI office in Denver. "We tipped off our rangers about the kidnapping." "We warned them to silence." "They were ordered to search all cars." "To list all occupants." "And bring in suspicious persons." "The father had let eighteen hours go by." "Eighteen precious hours." "National Guardsmen and other searchers were allowed to continue." "So as not to alarm the kidnapper." "Should he still be in the park." Right. Form a line ten feet apart and head south through the woods. "At Pinnacle Camp grounds .." "The motorcyclist who had delivered the ransom money." "Was picked up as he was packing to leave the park." "At about this time the Royal Gorge Limited .." "Made an unscheduled stop in the heart of the canyon." "And special agent James Madden of the FBI got off." "En-route from Denver to Salt Lake City." "Madden had been contacted by the Denver field office." "As the agent then closest to Royal Gorge Park." "Mr Lambert identified the cyclist, whose name was Driscoll." "And he admitted his part in the case." Sure, I delivered the package. This guy came to me and gave me five hundred bucks. So I cow-trailed it up to Lookout Point and put the package in the rocks. And that is all there is to it, mister. I am still holding you for the FBI. The FBI? Holy smokes. What am I into? You got to make a charge. I have a charge. Reckless driving where only mountain goats should go. Besides, the rim of the gorge trail needs a shovel crew after your ride. "Our net caught a few strange fish." "A girl who was wanted in Grand Junction for shoplifting." "She thought the net was for her so she blabbed it out." "And a bigamist." "Whose talents certainly weren't obvious." "A scared mobster from the plush pitfalls of Nevada .." "Seemed to have possibilities as a suspect." "I tried to reassure the father that everything was going to be alright." "Personally, I was very glad to welcome Mr Madden aboard." "And I'm sure Mr Lambert was relieved to have the FBI on hand." "I briefed Madden on the happenings so far in the case." "And continued with the investigation." "Meanwhile, a careful check of all cars continued at every exit from the park." Sorry to hold you up, sir. This one is okay, Mack. On you go. Can I see your park permit, sir. And your driver's licence. Thank you. Is this car registered in your name, Mr Hansen? Yeah, that's right. We'd like to take a look in the back, sir. Been fishing, eh? Those are some nice rainbows. Where did you get them? Where I was camping. Comanche Lake. Comanche, Lake, eh? Sure are nice ones. This must be yours, huh? Are you a peace officer? No. Just a citizen. I'm camping alone. You know. A guy likes to have a little security. Did you declare this when you came in the park? Why, no. I'll take your keys, Mr Hansen. Why? I'd like you to explain to the Chief Ranger about this gun. Firearms aren't allowed in national parks, Mr Hansen. A guy has got to have some protection. From what, the birds? I hear you had good luck fishing. I caught my limit. Ten days straight. Rainbows. For my own personal information. Where did you snag all these rainbows? Comanche Lake. Erickson. The helicopters. Well, you'd better have them scan the walls of the gorge. And search the Copper Gulch area. And warn the pilots about air currents and downdrafts. Have them take off late afternoon. Okay, Mack? So, you caught rainbows in Comanche Lake. That is very interesting. And highly unusual. As there has been no fish in Comanche Lake since the fall when we poisoned it. The trout were sick with a contagious fungus. We won't restock it until next spring. "Ranger Atkins identified Hansen as the man .." "Who had made a call from an emergency box in the high country the day before." "From the conversation .." "Atkins gathered that Hansen was talking to a doctor." "Hansen had explained to the ranger .." "That his partner at their camp on Comanche Lake had been hurt." "Atkins checked later and tried to help." "And found no camp and no partner." "Hansen didn't remember the doctor's name." We found this in Hansen's truck. - It was inside the spare tire. You said you took down the numbers? Yes, sir. I didn't have much time. Just the last bill in each packet. 'L-2- 3'. '9-2-9'. '2-0-4-B'. Where is Danny? Tell me, where is my son? I paid you the money. You told me you would let him go. Well, answer. What have you done? Mr Lambert. If I had my way I'd kick your guts all over this room. You take it from here, Mr Madden. And good luck. You've had the luck. By nabbing a kidnap suspect so quickly. There can be no luck until that boy is found. "Reports on the suspect came in from the identification division in Washington." "Mr Arthur Hansen's true name turned out to be Gerald Barker." "Plus a host of aliases." "He was a man with a busy but not imposing criminal record." "His favorite professional interest seemed to be extortion." So, a wealthy kid is missing from a summer camp. This happens every summer all over the U.S. I am waiting around for just such a set up. Then this Lambert kid runs away. I know his old man is loaded. So I sent kidnap notes. And make it look like the real thing. Like that jacket, for instance. Then I wait around to collect the money. But I don't know this kid. I never saw him before. Never been near him. There has been no kidnapping. I just gambled on the chance .. That the kid would be missing long enough for me to collect the money. I won my bet. The kid will turn up. You will see. "That was the position that Barker took." "And he stuck to it spite of all our questioning." "Barker refused to reveal the hiding place of the rest of the ransom money." "And of course, we didn't have the authority to hammer the truth from him." "Which is to be regretted." "He denied having accomplices." "As for the jacket he sent to Mr Lambert." "Barker insisted he had bought it in Canyon City." "And he did have a purchase slip to prove it." "I went down to Canyon City to verify this last piece of evidence." "Canyon City is only a few miles from the entrance to the Royal Gorge Park." "Despite laboratory tests." "We had been unable to tie the ransom jacket up with Danny Lambert." "So, I didn't have too much hope." "It was a plain blue denim type such as millions of kids around the country .." "Wear in the summertime." "The jacket was too commonplace to pinpoint." "And the owner couldn't identify it as coming from his store." "The sales check was dated the 18th." "The day Danny disappeared." "And was positively identified." "Apparently, in this one instance." "Barker was telling the truth." "He had bought the jacket." "When I showed Barker's photograph to the clerks." "None of them recognised the suspect." "I informed our Denver office that Barker's story on the jacket checked." "The agent in charge said that the United States District Attorney .." "Preferred a bird in the hand to one out in the wild blue yonder." "The government felt it had a straight extortion case and nothing more." "And that is what we ended up with." "An extortion case, pure and simple." "Barker pled guilty to extortion." "Because of his manner in court his frozen face and icy eyes." "The newsmen gave him the name 'The Iceman'." "And the judge gave him 1-5 years." "The Iceman was sent to Cascabel Island prison to serve his sentence." "Despite its non-penal exterior." "Cascabel, because of its geographical location .." "Is considered a maximum security institution." "Cascabel, incidentally, is Spanish for rattlesnake." "On good behaviour Barker would be out in a matter of months." "And who wouldn't be on good behaviour with $200,000 hidden away somewhere?" "The concept of modern penology .." "Is to rehabilitate regardless of the nature of the crime." "So that a man does not just disappear into prison and become lost." "In order to accomplish the primary objective." "The penologist realizes the criminal still has habits and emotions." "That he has to be kept locked up and guarded .." "Does not mean that he is any less a human being." "For the first thirty days like any other newcomer." "Barker was assigned to a specially segregated orientation cell block." "The new fish, like our Iceman." "Are studied by the various divisional officers of the prison." "When they added their findings together .." "They had about as thorough a picture of Barker a study could give." "By the time the Iceman had finished his 30-day quarantine period." "I made it a point to go down to Cascabel." "To confer with Warden Machek." Well, your Iceman has been studied, psyched and analysed. He thinks he's tough and he is tough. As cold as a clam and as likeable. I wanted him assigned to work as tough as he is. But the man has a hernia that needs attention. Did he agree to an operation? No. Violently. No, he refused. He said he would take care of it himself when he got out. A 'real doctor in a real hospital' as he put it. Probably afraid of talking under the anaesthetic. Yes, that is it. Since Barker is so tough and uncooperative .. I've assigned him to the lion's den. You'll remember some of these. All lifers. Old-timers. Prison wise. 'Machine-gun Mason'. He started out by knocking off husbands to order for itchy wives. And did some work for the mobs. He ran with the Corpus crowd for a while. He was suspected of being the machine gunner in the Kansas City massacre. 'Benny Kelly'. He is the youngest of the lot. Went like a comet through the mid-west about ten years ago. The 'mad-dog' type. He kills for excitement because he likes it. He never made a nickel out of bloodshed. 'Alamo Smith'. Border killer. Narcotic runner. Wetback smuggler. You know, he isn't a bad guy. If he is kept locked up. 'Rollo Lamar'. Bank robber. Killer and strategist. He became so good at planning bank jobs .. The gangs used to use him as a consultant. If and when he ever gets out of here. The states of Missouri, Iowa, Georgia and New York have holds on him. Well. There they are. The wormy aristocracy of Cascabel. The Iceman will be in proper company any minute now. If his icy outlook ever cracks. If the grapevine here sends up the slightest smoke signal .. I'll let you know. - Thanks, Warden. And remember. Anything at all. There is slimy Barker the kidnapper. You dirty rotten snatcher. You fink you. We don't want you. You're a yellow kidnapper, Barker. Hey, rat Iceman. Suck it up a little, Iceman. This is home. In here. Well. The Iceman cometh. The kid killer. Boy, that's really scraping the bottom of the barrel. I am Barker. Gerry Barker. Who asked you? As long as you are here. Why don't we forget who you are? What are you trying to do? Blow us all to kingdom come? The safety valve is not working. Best pack the steam into the other boiler. Into the heating system? They're cleaning that boiler. Do what I tell you. Hey, Mason. Close the door to the boiler. We are going to pack steam into it. You ought to tell them about .. Dipsy. And kick all our plans down the drain? Close the valve to the outlet pipe. Let her blow. Let me out of here! Please let me out. Let me out of here! Please help me. I'd give the old ranch house. And my best Bramber bull. For just one hour with Sadie. Sadie was from Amarillo. She was as pretty as a sunset. Sweet and loving. Besides, her old man didn't get wise. Alamo, you shouldn't talk like that. You are here to be rehabilitated. You leave me be, Rollo. Well, I would sure give a lot to be up in the mountains fishing. Maybe you could hook another kid? I didn't snatch that kid. I never even saw him. I got one-to-five for extortion. Are you guys smarter than the FBI? The FBI don't spend much time in penal institutions. Of which this one happens to be a model. They don't know how we think. But we know how you think. Listen, you. We got to live with you and we got to see you and we got to smell you. We don't have to listen to you. Now shut up. Come on, get up. Come on. Come on. - Don't be a jerk. You want to get the hole? For a creep like him? That is very wisely said, gentlemen. I am only a poor nameless number. [ Tannoy ] "All inmates. Cell Block D." "Prepare for special count." "Stand against the back wall facing out." Sing out your names. Mason. Kelly. - Lamar. Smith. - Barker. Somebody must be missing. Everybody around here is missing. But nobody misses us. Hey, you guys. You want this magazine? What's he got, Benny? What is it? The lottery. You can go to prison for that, you know. Well, who cares? If that's something for the guys on the inmate council I'd like to get in on it. You want to get in on something good? Look. We're fighting a war around here and nobody is neutral. Spies wind up with a shiv in their kidneys. You saw something you shouldn't see. Put it in your unconscious. Forget it. Don't worry about me. I'm no rat. No. You are no rat. You just kill kids. Any questions? [ Guards whistle ] "As we continued with our investigation of the Lambert case on the outside." "The reports from Cascabel indicated the Iceman was neither melting or cracking." "Barker automatically became the most hated man in Cascabel." "He had done the worst thing that man can do." "He had harmed a child." "As society had locked him away from itself." "So his fellow inmates locked him out of their lives." "He had plenty of time to himself to think things over." Why couldn't they have sent that creep to Alcatraz? Let's fix it so he makes the hole. Yes. I can figure. He ain't no use to any of us anyway. That is where you are wrong. This guy is an asset to our burdened lives. The ego of every man in this joint is going up a hundred percent. There is someone you can look down on and feel superior to. You know, I think I'll give this creep a break. Yeah. There is probably a break in it for yourself somewhere. You are so right. Look at the king fish. What do you know? Getting chummy with the Iceman. We had better lay off Barker until we get the drift. You weren't supposed to see what happened to Dipsy. Who is Dipsy? He's the guy that had the unfortunate accident in the boiler. Around here, we say it's like .. Being pardoned by God. I suppose by now you got an inkling, huh? If I have it's my business. What you saw, forget. If you don't I'll step on you and squash you. Look, you. Top dog. Big wheel. Boss con. Or whatever you rate around this iron lung. You don't scare me. Okay, so all the pimps and perverts and pot-lickers have no time for me. Fine. But nobody around this joint calls me a squealer. I appreciate your ethical outlook. Well, appreciate it someplace else as this hate business goes two ways. Have I ever said anything to deprecate you? Have I ever said anything against you? On the contrary. You have got my respect. Do you realise that the FBI have solved every kidnapping but one .. Since they took jurisdiction twenty years ago? And you are the guy that got away with it. Believe me, boy. You have got my admiration. There wasn't any kidnapping. You are smart. Real smart. Cop a plea and serve a short term for extortion. It's worth it too. Unless your accomplices waste the money or spend it. I get it. It is clever. You work alone. That is real clever. If you are smart, why share? I'd like to include you in a little adventure I have in mind. Yeah. That's cosy. The one guy everyone wants to spit on. Wait a minute. Intelligence I admire. Besides, you have got an inkling. I can't give you all the details right now but I'll tell you this much. I intend to lose the motherly care of this institution. Crash out? No, no. Not me. I am serving my time with good time every month. Oh, I get it. Like working. You serve your time at $40,000 a year and after you leave you collect, huh? Look. Just leave me out of this. Just leave me out. You got your plans. I got mine. What's with that weasel brain of yours? Have you gone screwy? It said on the radio he hid his take in the Royal Gorge Park. If we go after it we get nailed. We may as well have your comment too, Junior. Why did you tell that creep anything? He'll quote it to the warden. Now hear me. There's fifty, maybe a hundred guys in here know we're up to something fishy. Would they turn us in? May I say: not if they were boiled in oil. And Mr Barker won't rat on us either. And I've got news for him. He is going out with us. He's our golden goose worth $200,000. We'll never get to it. That's right. Barker is still too hot. The law will lay a big fat trap for us if we go after that dough. I've thought of that. Believe me, I've thought of everything. Now, the Iceman is going to die in the escape. Apparently die. Any of you geniuses now what 'apparently' means? Apparently? - Yeah. Yeah. It means something that ain't looks like it is. That is excellent. Now, I want all you guys to lay off him. He's a walking map to buried treasure. We're going to need him so bad when we get on the outside. Get back to work. The Iceman is on his way up to the warden's office. You told that creep too much. He is going up front to bubble it to the warden. He will be in solitary in two hours. Oh, stop it. He's not going to rat on us. Is everything ready? Yeah. The tunnel from the steam pipe to the outfall. We are set. Are the gadgets all made? Yeah. Five sets. I hope they work underwater. Alright. Now, listen to me. Tomorrow is the first of the month. We go on nightshift. The boat will be ready any night after tonight. The Iceman just came from the warden's office. He wanted the warden to change his cell. To give him a different work detail. That's all? - That's all. What did the warden say? He would think about it. Thanks, Randy. Get lost. Well. Rollo was right again, wasn't he. Now, I don't want the Iceman to slip through my fingers. Hey. Take a look. There he is. That is my pigeon. I'm going to kidnap a kidnapper for the ransom he kidnapped for. It is ironical and profitable. "Because probable kidnapping was involved .." "Our local Denver office kept its files open on the Lambert case." "It was decided I interview again the person who had last seen the boy alive." "The nurse Emily Evans." And the doctor also advised against using the needle .. Because of disturbing the boy further? I don't recall, Mr Madden. The day Danny disappeared, the doctor was away. I was in charge. One of those idiot playground directors. You know, they think athletics can cure anything. Allowed Danny Lambert to enter into a race. Imagine. A child with chronic severe asthma. When he was brought to me at the hospital he was suffering. I merely tried to take the quickest way of relieving him. You see, Danny was no stranger to me. I liked him and I wanted to ease his attack. Mr Madden. I felt terrible over this whole thing. To think that Danny ran away from me and disappeared from the face of the earth. You said Danny was no stranger. You knew him before he came to summer camp. Right here in Denver. His parents used to bring him for allergy shots to Dr Reiner .. When I worked for him three years ago. Thank you, Miss Evans. You've been very helpful. Have I? "A new fact." "The name of Dr Reiner had not been brought up in this connection before." "But it had in another." "It rang a bell in my brain." "There it was in Barker's record." "In 1951 he had attempted to blackmail a Dr Reiner." "And Emily Evans the nurse, and also the last person to see the boy alive .." "Had worked for Dr Reiner in 1951." "So I interviewed Dr Reiner." "A professional man of the highest calibre." "Yes. In 1951 he had been the victim of attempted blackmail." "It was a pure shakedown trying to get the doctor in a compromising situation." "The plan didn't work." "The doctor refused to pay and refused to prosecute over a fear of publicity." "Why had he discharged Miss Evans?" "Over the blackmail case?" "No. She had nothing to do with that." "But there had been a mistake in his narcotic inventory." "And no doctor can afford irregularities in that." "So he had discharged her." "The life of Miss Evans it seemed, would bear a little looking in to." "We checked the records of the Denver Nurses Registry." "Emily Evans full name turned out to be Emily Eurydice Evans." "And she had a good record." "Among other things .." "She volunteered her professional skills to help the blood bank without pay." "The Red Cross worker was high in her praise of Miss Evans cooperation." "And suggested that I myself cooperate by .." "Giving a pint of blood." "I was running out of leads." "Rangers had turned up no trace of the missing boy." "Lambert had given me all the information he could." "But the Iceman wasn't cracking in the slightest." "And Miss Evans was spotless." "I talked again to the manager of the Cliffhanger Bar." "With his help I located in Canyon City a Terry Ripley .." "Who had worked as a bellhop during the summer." "And had brought Mr Lambert the message to go and check his car." And what did the person look like who gave you the message for Mr Lambert? Well, gosh. I don't remember. Well, was he a tall man or medium or ..? No, no. It wasn't a man. It was a lady. A woman? Yeah. She gave me fifty cents and told me how to find Mr Lambert. And then told me what to say. And you don't remember her well enough so you could identify her? That's right. I don't. Thanks, Terry. Mr Madden. There was one funny thing though. She could have given him the message herself. She went right by where he was. What was the reason she gave you to have you do it? She said she had to get back to the hospital. That she was on duty. Thanks, Terry. Thanks very much. "After what Terry Ripley told me about a woman who worked in a hospital .." "Giving him the message, we turned our attention back to nurse Evans." "While she was on duty we gave her apartment a thorough vacuuming." "And found two objects of great interest." "A Kino gambling sheet from Aubrey's club, Las Vegas, Nevada." "It was dated by time clock." "The date was three days after Danny Lambert disappeared." "The other object was a whiskey decanter." "An attractive piece of work." "But more attractive to us because we found Barker's fingerprints on it." Miss Evans, do you know this man? No. No, I don't. Wait a minute. I've seen that face in the papers. That is the kidnap .. The extortionist. So you think he is a kidnapper too? That was in the papers. Now, Miss Evans. Right after the boy vanished, you took a week's leave and went to Las Vegas. The hotel clerk said you kept checking to see whether a Mr Hansen had arrived. Yes. I .. There is an old friend of mine named Hansen. Hansen was the name Barker was using when the rangers arrested him. Oh. It is a mighty fine decanter. You must be proud of it. - What is it doing here? The Iceman Mr Barker liked it too. His fingerprints are all over it. Let's go over this, Miss Evans. You knew about the boy. About his illness and his wealth. You probably knew Barker .. Because of the blackmail attempt when you were working for Dr Reiner. You might even have contacted Barker. To suggest he kidnap Danny Lambert from summer camp, where kids often get lost. You are dreaming, mister. You prove it. The boy ran from the hospital in fear of the needle. Later that night or the next morning. He ran into the tender arms of the Iceman. It was extortion that you sent him to prison for. We have since proven him a kidnapper. He hid Danny Lambert in an abandoned fire tower. We found the boy's fingerprints and Barker's. Danny had scribbled his name here and there. That is enough to prove kidnapping. Although there is still no trace of the child. That is his case history and nothing to do with me. Except you put the jacket and the final ransom instructions in Lambert's car. You had the boy Terry Ripley give Mr Lambert a message to go to his car. Then flew to Las Vegas to meet Hanson, or Barker, and then shared the ransom. Except Barker was caught. Now much of the money was your share? None. I never saw any of it. Oh, this is terrible. He said he wouldn't hurt Danny. Just get the money. Matron. Take her out and get her some coffee. She can talk later. Get a warrant for felony kidnapping on Barker .. And a court order releasing him to our custody for trial on new charges. Yes, sir. You're next. I ain't going. Captain of the watch? Captain Arnold? This is Handley. Power plant. You got to swim for half a mile out into the bay. There is about 15-20 minutes worth of oxygen in this tank. Don't waste it. I'm no skin diver. I can't even swim. I haven't had much practice myself lately. Just pull the water into your arms like you would a dame. You will make it. Come on, let's get out of here. Go ahead, men. I think it will be easier to swim if we all take our shoes off. Now don't forget. If we get into enough water put your mouthpiece on and turn the air valve on. When you get to the end of the pipe .. You'll be thirty feet underwater so stay down as they'll have lights up above. Okay? Good luck to you. I'm beginning to appreciate the delights of our good old cell. Maybe we should have left you there. Now come on. Let's go. Your next, Iceman. Turn around. Move out. Well, something has happened. Looks like all hell has broken loose out there. Yeah. I hope they pay you. Are those words as good as a governor's pardon? Is that you, Rollo? No. I'll go back and try to find him. Is that all of you? Yeah. Yeah. That's all. Go on, go on. Take off. No lights. You alright? Thanks, Benny. You saved my life. That is alright. Is he dead? Did he drown? Well, he swallowed an awful lot of water. Get him up. Come on. Look at the good Samaritan. Fattening the golden goose. When they see the Iceman came also, they will know we're after his buried ransom. They will stake out the whole Royal Gorge country. Yeah. That's what I kept telling you. I know you did. So we are going to have to do away with the Iceman. But then we won't know where he's hidden his loot. Apparently done away with. I told you this before. Now do what I said earlier. Get busy. You mean Benny? - Yeah, Benny. That still goes? - It still goes. He just saved your life. - Alright. So he saved my life. Go on, go on. Get busy. Here. You put Barker's shirt on him. I will light the torch. You put Barker's shirt on him. I will light the torch. Burn that. Make it look like it's been in a fire. Alright. Now Benny. With this? Why not? He's dead, isn't he? Destroy the fingerprint ridges. Char the features real good. Then burn the shirt but leave Barker's number on it. What are you doing to the kid? Stay where you are, pride of Texas. The kid got us out. He knew what to do. We couldn't have got out of it without the kid. He was useful to us when I told him what to do. Now his body is useful to us. Alright. Go ahead. Throw him to the sharks. Want to head for shore, Rollo? Huh? We came out here to go fishing so let's make it look good. We fish. Head out to sea. Turn your heads the other way. There is a boat passing. You want them to see us, huh? He feels safer with the cops than with us. He is right. Put that radio back on the news band, will you. Listen, Rollo. We heard the news forty times. There's nothing on it. There has going to be something. Put it back, will you. Alright, Barker. You got a choice. Either you join us. Or you join Alamo and Benny. A bite. And it's a beauty. Take the hook out. Take it out. Come on, take it off the hook. It's got teeth. Please, will you take it off the hook. Unhook it. Unhook it, will you. Shall I belt him again? - No. Let him alone. Let him alone. Alright, Now listen to me. You thought it over? I'm not cutting anyone in. I took all the risk. I took a big risk kidnapping you from the Pen too. Suppose I got it in my head to kill you? What good will dough do you tomorrow? Wait a minute. Listen. [ Radio: ] "From Cascabel Island prison." "The two bodies found afloat in the sea off Angel's Point by a sardine boat." "Have been identified as those of Alamo Smith." "A Texas narcotic runner." "And Geraldo Barker. Known as the Iceman." "A suspected kidnapper." "Barker's body was badly burned." "He was identified by his prison jacket." "Authorities believe that the escaping convicts were picked up by a powerboat." "That there was an explosion and fire at sea." "And that all had to abandon the boat in a hurry." "No trace of the boat nor of the other three escapees has been found." "However." "The FBI states they are satisfied as to the identification of the dead men." "As Alamo Smith and Geraldo Barker." The all-knowing FBI. God bless them. May congress cut their next appropriation. Okay, Tommy. Get under way. You know the favor I have done you. Barker the Iceman is dead. You're free to roam around at will and spend the dough you got from the kidnap. What course, Rollo? I don't know. Maybe back to the mainland or maybe south to Mexico. It's up to this creep. Just stand by. You got two minutes to make your choice. If you don't work out I got other plans. And it's my free time you are wasting. There is no choice. Either I cut you in or .. You knock me off. What kind of a deal is that? I appreciate your realistic outlook. You know something? For a million dollars you shouldn't be alive. I tell you what I'll do with you. I'll take half your dough and give you a break. Like you gave Benny and Alamo? - Shut up. We are not playing ping-pong and your two minutes are just about up. Look. Put me ashore. Let me go and you can have all of it. I'll tell you where it is. In the Royal Gorge Park up in Colorado. Oh, that's clever. Somewhere in a thousand square miles of mountains. No you don't, Iceman. You are going to take us to it. When I get my hands on the dough, like big businessmen say, it's a firm deal. Now stop hedging, kid. What do you say? I'll take you to it. Tommy. Head for the mainland. You know my instructions. Now go on with your run-down. You gave out a news item .. That Barker's body had been found at sea. Yeah, They wanted us to believe that. So we led them to believe that we believe it. How complicated can you get? But whose body was it? We don't know but it wasn't Barker's. Prison records show that he had a bad hernia condition. The body with Barker's jacket on it showed no sign of a hernia. Now look, Will. This is a gamble. Maybe the others are dead too. Drowned. Maybe there was a boat accident. But the bank robber Rollo and the others hated the Iceman. They took him with them. They tried to make us believe that he was dead. They took him with them for only one reason. He was worth a fortune. And that fortune is hidden somewhere in your park. I guess there's nothing for us to do but sit here and wait until something pops. Keep moving. Keep moving. Howdy. - Hi. Fishing eh? Yeah. Hiking up to Comanche Lake. Well, it's a nice hike. But you won't find any fish. We poisoned the lake to kill all the fish. And I caught my limit there ten days running in July. Maybe you rangers are keeping that lake for yourselves. Good luck. You did pretty good. Yeah. You know this country real well. I think that's clever. I hope so. Let's go. Walkie-talking Number 1. Chapman. Calling radio control car. Come in please, McCormick. "Mr Erickson." "Joe Chapman reports one of the three men. He answers Barker's description." "He said he'd caught fish ten days running in Comanche lake last July." "They're on the trail to Deception Peak on the rim of the gorge." "Over." The Iceman. This is Erickson. Put this on the Walkie-talkie. All standby parties are to converge east of Deception Peak. We'll be right up. Over and out. Let's go. The only man who catches fish in Comanche Lake is Gerry Barker. He is one fisherman that's been caught twice with the same lie. If I were in the Iceman's boots I'd want to get caught too. All Walkie-talkies. This is McCormick from Porcupine Peak. "The three suspects are crossing Little Beaver valley towards Deception Peak .." "On the rim of the gorge." "Walkie-talkie units on standby in other areas." "Converge east of Deception Peak at rendezvous point." "Await arrival of chief ranger." Mobile Unit 7. Johnson and Smith. We are at Big Cedar meadow. "The three men are coming up the slope out of Little Eagle Valley." "They are heading for the Grizzly Flat route to Deception Peak." "On the rim of the gorge." "They have crossed the ridge into Grizzly Flat." "Mobile 7 over and out." Throw him over the cliff. Come on. Lamar and Mason! You are completely surrounded. You have thirty seconds to surrender. Or you can jump a thousand feet to the bottom of the gorge. Don't shoot. Please. Please don't shoot. Please. Please. Please don't shoot. No, Don't kill me. Please. "And so the case that began in the Royal Gorge Park." "Ended there." "The unconscious Barker was taken into custody." "All the ransom money was recovered." "Rollo Lamar, bank robber and advisor to bank robbers." "Died in the gas chamber for the murder of Alamo Smith." "Emily Evans, who clinched the case against the kidnapper Gerry Barker." "Is now doing twenty years to life in a federal prison for women." "Gerry Barker, the Iceman." "Also went to the gas chamber for felony kidnapping." "He kept his secret to the end." "And that secret was: what had happened to Danny Lambert?" "Only the canyons, the mountains and the snows of the Royal Gorge country .." "Know the answer." ...w-g...
