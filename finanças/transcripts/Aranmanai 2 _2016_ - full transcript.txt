~By Zeus~ Guru Ji, we have reached the temple. Tell us what to do now. Take the car to the left. Hey brother, take the car to the left. Listen, increase the speed of work. Is it necessary to shift the idol? Otherwise the frame of the temple will fall. This has happened for the first time. Goddess has always helped us. That is why it is our duty to take care of the temple properly. What if the paranormal experts know about it? That is why we have to keep Tantrics away from this? And I have given this responsibility to Laxman. You have given duty to the right person. Not only Tantrics but I will not even let ghosts come near the temple. Listen people, work properly. Listen, pick up the idol carefully. No scratch should come on it. Okay master, we will take care of it. Anyways, for how many days we will have to be away from Goddess? On the 10th day we will establish the idol here with all the rituals. Hail to Goddess. What is the matter Baba? Why did you call for goats in hurry? After so many years the idol of Goddess is being removed. This is the last opportunity we have to rule the world. Not only people from our village but from far.. ..people come here to get rid of ghosts and evil spirits. Today while removing the idol of Goddess in the temple she will be consecrated. Goddess will be kept in a treasure box full of grains for 10 days. For these 10 days the Goddess will lose all her powers. This is the opportunity to get control of evil spirits that are in slumber. By having control over them we can get the black magic and rule the world. Oh my God, this is a very powerful evil spirit. Come on run ..hurry up. From tomorrow the carpenters will start their work. - You get the work done under your supervision. - Yes. You do not worry. Hail to Goddess. Only 10 days are left for temple's great offering. So much work is left. We will have to do all this work. We cannot have faith on anyone else. Hey, he is the dumb priest. He is always calm but why is he so restless today. He is behaving in a strange manner. Maybe he is hungry. Give him the bananas. Take this. He must be a mad beggar.. Go away. What is this? Who has put a lock on the gate? I think Komal must have again gone to sleep after locking the gate. - Call her. - You have some misunderstanding. She will not come. For last 23 years she is not talking to me. That means for so many years you both have still not compromised. It can happen in Pakistan but.. Why did you put a lock on the gate? I did not put. Then did it come on its own? Put one lock on your mouth as well. Neither I want to see your face nor talk to you. I don't know when will you become better. She doesn't even look good nor has a sweet voice. How many times will you say the same thing? Hold my hand. Hold my hand. Hold my hand. He is not from our caste. - You can't marry him. - Leave. Leave me. - Let me go. Leave me. - no. quiet. I will die without him. - He belongs to a lower caste. - I want to go. He will bring disgrace for us in the society. Stop, stop.. Who is there? Save me..Kali, Kali.. Kali.. Where are you Kali? Hey Kali.. When I reached the hall I saw that sir was lying unconscious on the floor. Because of being hurt on the head he has gone into coma. But doctor says that he is out of danger. Did you call up Murali? I called him many times but cannot get through his number. How will you get through? To roam around before marriage like this is a sin. I will message him. It's really nice. What happened? Father is in coma. Come soon. Murali.. ..you don't worry. Uncle will be fine soon. Doctor has advised to keep him at home instead in the hospital. He might gain consciousness soon if is at home. She is a nurse and has come to take care of father. She will stay in the guest room. I have to go to Allahabad for some important work. You stay here and look after uncle. Keep his luggage in the car. - Okay. Murali.. Suresh, come. Look, someone is there. Hey, there is no one there. - Let's go. Come on. You just keep saying anything. Many years ago he got deeply hurt on his backbone. He could neither walk nor lie down. In such a situation a physician came and treated him. The physician did what doctors could not do. If we call him then your father will be cured soon. There is no problem of money. You just call that physician. I remember I had noted his name and address in a diary. I will write a letter to him immediately. We have to take account of it so that is why. The idli should be sold and the business prospers and I should earn. Whose order is this? It is from government hospital and it is order of 10 plate's idli. I am going there. You take care here. - Whose order is it. Tell him that idli is over. - Why are you rejecting the order? - Stay away. I made that doctor eat Dosa yesterday and he got food poisoning. - Give one more plate idli. - Take this and concentrate on work. - Come inspector, eat dosa and then go. - It is so hot. It is his hearing today so if I eat and go then will get late. ..and there will be problem in the stomach. - He will escape if I sit to eat. - Look at his innocent face. He is very soft like idli. Release him. Tie him with the cart. Eat and then go. - Okay fine. Don't even think of escaping. Bring the idli that was lying in the mud. Don't move. I think he has been trapped in wrong case. Thinking about this is not our work. Come on put water. Hey… Stop him. He took my cart. Stop… What are you doing? Hey, he is running with my cart. Someone stop him. Does anyone run like this? Give my handcuffs back otherwise the money will be deducted from my salary. Hey, that hooligan destroyed my business of idli sambhar. And you are worried about the handcuffs. Master, all utensils are broken. Everything that was round has become square. Dogs took away the utensils because there was spicy paste on it. The photograph of you sinner father has remained. Take it. Hey, I have not hung this inauspicious frame because of love for my father. Someone said that by hanging photo of donkey good luck comes to business. My shop is totally destroyed now what the use of this photo is. - Throw it. - Sir..our luck is going to shine. This is not a letter but lottery's ticket. - Are you mad? - Sir, that landlord is seriously ill. They are ready to give any amount. My father is in hell. Look carefully. There is only one difference between you and your sinner father. If you have a bath properly then you will look like him. - But I am not a doctor. - They do not know. We will go as false doctor and get the real money. Hey, why have you come here? Go and sleep. There is someone on the bed. There is someone on my bed. Who? - I don't know. Come with me. Murali, have you come to see Suresh? Who is with grandfather? Father.. How did this happen? Father.. Father.. Who would not have heard your name? You have treated so many diseases. - You are right. The life of the person is over whomsoever I have treated. Komal, Komal.. Sir, why did that man run away saying coma, coma.. He was not saying coma but Komal.. Komal.. Komal.. Komal.. Do one thing. You stay here and I will be back soon. Komal, today you will see your brother again. The physician who has come for sir's treatment.. ..is none other than your lover who was separated at the platform. - Really.. - Yes sister. He is the same. Your old lover. I gave you such good news and give me something sweet to eat. I can hear sound of dog, cat and frog but cannot hear the heartbeat. It is easy to save someone from the jaws of death.. ..but difficult to save someone from coma. Everyone says that you will cure my father but I do not know how. - Even I do not know. - What? I want to check his pulse. I want silence as silence zone in hospital. Go, go.. Sir, why all this in front of everyone? I have never seen any landlord so closely. He is in coma but his face is glowing so much. Come, come.. Coming… Hold my hand. Come quickly… Komal. I miss you. Sir, since long that old woman is staring at you. She is trying to woo you. You have become old but you are still stylish and sexy. This old woman is not talking about me. I am talking about you, dear. That day also you were looking so smart. Which day are you talking about? - Don't trouble her. Tell her the truth. Now I will never intervene in matter of your romance. Now hurry up marry her and make me uncle. I will be back. Why is he trapping me to become uncle? Did you see she has become so active all of a sudden? You came like the season of love for her, brother-in-law. Season of love..are you drunk? I know you are also annoyed with me. But you both are made for each other. I have separated two lovers so that is why I have been very unfortunate. Marry my sister and now it is time for you to get destroyed. Sir, that old woman is you sinner father's lover. And this rascal is thinking of getting you married to her. I will get you married immediately. All my sins will be washed when my nephew will be born and will urinate on me. Hey stupid, just to wash away your sins you will make me a fool. - Where is it? Where is it? - I did not mean that. Hey, you are unnecessarily getting annoyed. Hey, save me. Your Sari..not Sari but sorry.. I will help you. - Sorry. - It is okay grandfather. Grandfather.. I want to become grandfather of her grandchildren. And she made me grandfather. Romance.. Even the taste of my idli was not so bad. Enough, enough..stop it. Who became mischievous first? So this is the reward for that. Murali, enough. Are you mad? You made my entire Sari wet. Hello, what are you looking at? Go away from here and do your work. I was trying to work but you came in between. Hey, what did you say? Nothing. I heard what you said. Say it again. I did not say anything. - Murali, leave it. You do not know what he said. I am saying let him go. If she does not have any problem in me seeing her.. ..then what problem do you have? Murali. Leave him. Murali.. - Leave me Anita. You are doing wrong. - Rascal. Wait, Murali.. Wait, wait… Have you gone mad? - I will not spare him. Why are you beating him? What has happened to him? Tell me. First ask him to leave. Hey, go away from here. Didn't you hear? Go. Have patience Murali. Why are you being so angry? If you are seen here again then.. - Murali.. My dear, my darling.. My dear.. - What are you doing? I have just found this way of treatment. Love, massage.. You are doing massage and I am waiting in the passage. What has happened to your voice? How come your sweet voice changed to like that of a witch? It is not my voice but that of aunty. - Aunty.. Who allowed you to come inside? No one is allowed unnecessarily near the patient. Go away from here. I just want to watch you doing massage. Hey, where are you going? Sit here and learn how to do treatment. Boss, today you are in trouble. I am not in trouble but the landlord is going to be in trouble. Try it out. Do you know what is it called? This is called dosa massage. So the old woman came to know. How did she come to know that you are massaging in the way of making dosa. Did she have any doubt? This is a treatment. Now see what I do. What next? - Next is fried bread and vegetable. This is called Pao Bhaji massage. Am I right? Either she is an astrologer or mad? How does she know so much? My father must have treated her. Do the special massage which you used do to me. What? Make her a fool. How? That is what I am making her. Do the beat massage dance. - Okay. I think the time has come to call his family members. Either he will be cured or will die. Hey yellow, dirty fellow.. You were doing Surya Namaskar by standing on him. What if he had died? You know how to do acupressure of fingers. You tried it so many times on me. I hope your back is not hurt. My back is not hurt but the beautiful girl went. By mistake I handed over groundnut oil to you. What is going on? After treatment the massage oil becomes cooking oil. Why did she go away laughing like a witch? Instead of telling you her feelings she wrote it on his back. She wrote with powder on the back and if.. ..she would have written with blood then his back would have gone. I am feeling very scared. I will sleep in your room today. Okay, fine. You will beat me. Now I will have to show you your position. Let me see who is awake so late at night. Who is it? Who are you? Hey, answer me. Save me. Who is there? Hey, what has happened to you? Who killed you? Murali, this house is not worth staying anymore. Take away everyone from here otherwise all will be killed. Hey Muthu.. Murali, what happened? What happened to Muthu? -What happened? Who was shouting, Yes sir. Okay sir I will see. He had a fight with the landlord's son. He had threatened to kill him. And he was found near the dead body. Okay sir. I also don't know.. I am sorry but I will have to arrest you. Tomorrow is Sunday so the court will be closed. His bail will be done on Monday. - What nonsense is this? Will my brother stay in jail for two days? - Brother.. ..let me go. Murali.. For such a small matter he killed the driver. So just think what will happen of a fraud doctor like you. Stupid, only those are killed who attack. I will bring peace before the fight starts. You do not know that I am very intelligent. One more thing. Look at my hand. My life line is very long. Longer than the highway. I will live long. Do you tell destiny after looking at the lines? Yes, you are right. After seeing the line of my hand.. ..it seems that I am going to go in flashback soon. My hair is going to become black. Why are you saying lies? Understand that the girl is trapped. How is my hand? It is very soft. It seems that you wash it with cream instead of soap. I am not talking about my hand but my line. When will I get married? If you agree then you will get married on next full moon day. What? I have still not found the boy. There is no need to find a boy. God has set everything. How will he look like? He is 5½ ft tall and mixture of Salman Khan and Shah Rukh Khan. When will I be able to see him? - You are already seeing him. When you take 3 rounds with eyes closed till then your super hero will come. One more thing. He must be different but you have to accept him. Okay. I think I am in need of massage now. Sir, why did you delay the matter till evening? You should have said that you are the groom. How could I go in front of her as old man? I will get time till evening to become a hero. If you are caught then you will be killed. Stupid, father and son look alike and.. ..if the matter goes wrong then straight away grandfather. Look at the entry of the hero. Hey stupid, am I not looking like a hero? You were looking smart in the get up of father. Shall I hit you? Don't forget that at this time I am not a comedian but a hero. Come on. She has burnt the lamp for offering. The lawyer has told me that there is nothing to worry. Is that you physician? After hair cut you have even dyed your hair. At the time of having bath by mistake instead of shampoo I applied dye.. ..so I have become young. Am I not looking cute? Okay. You are just looking okay. Why did he speak behind my back instead of saying it directly to me? Is there mirror behind me? My dear… Look, I have worn your favorite floral Sari. And have also put artificial flower. Come and hug me dear. I can do anything but will never hug this old woman. This get up is not for her but for Pari. She has already taken one round. My dear brother-in-law, my sister is ready for marriage and so are you after dyeing your hair. You will die for each other. He is talking of dying before living. He has taken the third round. Let me go. Your super hero is standing in front of you. Why are you showing your body to her? Let's take a selfie. After seeing your face even the mobile has got hanged. How can you take a selfie? Oh, God! - Hi. - Hi, I am Manju. You just talk to anyone. Who are you? He is Anita's brother. He shoots wild animals and show on Junglee TV. Supali Rao. - He is the one who is treating sir. Physician. Murali praised you a lot. You are very young in age. That is why I talked to you like that. Sorry grandfather. Grandfather? It was better if you had cursed me. Ravi, Anita told me that you were coming. When did you reach? - I just reached. Then come inside. - I really liked him. Thank you. - For what? You had said that after finishing rounds around basil plants.. ..my future husband will be face to face with me. Thank you. - I had said 5½ ft but he is 6½ ft. I am not bothered. I have not got less but have got extra. Girls like extra. Oh no, God has given me extra sadness in bonus. God has given me extra pain. Look at Manju. She fell in love so soon. But our love is so old but still we could not meet. I do not like you so spare me. I had really seen someone there. Don't talk nonsense. I had seen him. I took a leave so that I could make arrangements for your marriage.. ..but everything went wrong. Something strange is happening here, brother. I am scared that something wrong might happen. All this happening before marriage is not auspicious. You don't worry. Everything would be fine. Nothing will happen to Murali. Uncle is there. Come on, meeting time is over. You go and I am coming. When I reached father's room I saw that he was in air. After hearing screaming at night I came towards the well. Driver was lying in injured condition under the tree. When I went closer to him to talk he was trying to say something. But he could not tell me anything completely. Before that he.. There is a ghost here and everyone's life is in danger. I am not worried about myself.. ..but some problem might befall on people staying in that house. Why didn't you tell this to anyone else? Will anyone believe me? I just know one thing. There is something very scary in that house. The moment you reach his room, close the door from inside. I will scream and gather the family members. And in next 10 months you will guaranteed get married to him. But if people come to know that he has raped me then he will get insulted. Come out after getting disgraced. I will try my best. - All the best. My dear, beautiful beloved is here. The floor has been swept and if we rub more, then dents will be made. What do you want? I will do special cleaning for you. It is okay if you come to clean the room when there is no one. But I am having doubt on you that you have to clean the room .. ..especially when a man is there alone at night. Go now. I will teach you love in half a minute. What will you do in half a minute? Do you have lice in your hair? Why are you doing this? Wait and watch. Old woman, I have come to know your real intentions. I am not going to get trapped in your plan. Go. Go. Leave my hand. -No, no I will not go. No, I will not go. - I should be saying that. All of you come here. - Leave me. Leave my hand. - What are you doing? Hug me. What are you doing? - Come on. Who stole the glass from here? - You are tickling me. Brother, look here. - If you do not go.. ..then I will scream and gather everyone. My brother had to do this work. If you do not go then I will have to throw you out. Come on. Come on. Brother, scream. - Old woman. His eyes are open wide as if he has seen a ghost. Brother.. - Hey.. Don't shake him otherwise he will freeze. She is talking as if she is VIP. 'Sanskrit chant' 'Sanskrit chant' 'Sanskrit chant' Take this and eat something. If you give him money then he will throw it in the gutter. Hey, why are you throwing the mud? Are you mad? I will kill you if I see you again near this house. Go away from here. Get out. Hey.. ..what has happened Suresh? How did you come inside water? Tell me Suresh. Tell me. What has happened to you? - What were you doing in water? Be careful. - Suresh.. Are you fine? Nothing will happen to you. Today God saved him. How many times have I told you to play inside the house? Why did you go out? It is entirely your fault. You can't take care of a child. Servants cannot take place of a father. Understood. I was a fool to marry you. I always take care of him. Suresh, why did you leave that toy there? And how did it reach water? It came to me on its own. When it fell in water then you should have called someone to take it out. Why did you go in water? - It pulled me in water. Who? - The one who lives in our house. She always troubles me. Did you tell this to your mother? If I tell her then the nurse will get annoyed. How does it look? Tell me how it looks. What happened? Stop. Throwing flowers in water, red color on the wall, giving toy to the child.. What is the secret behind all this? Tell me why did you kill that driver. What did you say? You are the reason behind whatever is happening in the house. Tell me the truth. - No, I have not done anything. The entire fault is of my horoscope. My uncle had said that if I perform this ritual for 19 days.. ..then I will get married soon. That night when I sat down for the ritual then.. ..I heard the sound of bike from outside. I hid this secret from everyone.. ..so that no one comes to know about my ritual. Don't misunderstand me. You said that you had heard the sound of bike. From which side did it come? From this side. When Murali had beaten the driver then his hand get got fractured. In such condition he could not ride the bike. Then who was with him. What is this? - Measurement tape. Our first carpenter was crazy about facebook. One day while seeing facebook.. ..he was working on the cupboard and instead he hit his face. After that he never came face to face with me. The second carpenter had the habit of ringing the bell. So I send him to temple. Why are you asking about this? You are finding him. He has not come today. He has gone on leave from today. Till when he will come back. He will be back in 1-2 weeks. Hey Ram, why did you lie to him? You know that he is relative of landlord. Why did you do like this? There is something that I cannot tell you now. Hello.. I told you that he is on leave. Then why have you come again. Don't you understand? Go away quietly from here otherwise.. ..the legs with which you have walked and come.. Sir, don't hit. I will tell you. I just know that Murali has not committed any murder. Then who has done it? Are you telling? - I will tell you, sir. Don't hit me. That night Muthu and I were heavily drunk. Turn the bike towards the palace. What you have work there at late night? I have some work. Let's go. Why is the beggar screaming so much? There is no use of making you understand. You wait and I will set him right. Wait. What is the use of fighting again? For last 20 years I have hidden all their secrets within me.. ..and that young boy insulted me in front of everyone. He slapped me. I won't spare him. - Come on, don't do like this. In just two minutes I will set him right. I tried to make him understand but he did not agree. After waiting for long I peeped inside the palace. After seeing that scary scene I ran away from there. Next day police arrested Murali for killing Muthu. If I had talked about ghost then people would think that I am a fool. That is why I kept quiet, sir. I really saw a lady there. When I reached father's room then he was in the air. She always troubles me. I wanted to tell you another important thing sir. What? Hey, what is going on? - This is tradition. That is why before the festival the folk dancers.. ..come and dance in front of our palace. If they are really interested then send them to Dance India Dance. Don't stop them. Sir is in come so it would be auspicious if they dance here. Maybe sir become swell because of their dance. She is right. Then ask them to do break dance. Your dance is over so now you will get your money. Okay. Give the money. - Okay. ..so I have put cameras everywhere. What is this? This is a thermo scanner. Look there. You cannot see in dark. But look in the monitor. Look, everything can be seen clearly. This detects all those temperatures. Due to which we can see minute insects also clearly. What happened? - Someone was there. Where? - There. I saw it myself. Suresh is not to be seen anywhere. He cannot be found. What are you saying? - He was lying next to me. But when I opened my eyes he was not there. You will not be spared if you do not take care of him. Oh God, the light had to go now only. Come on, come on.. We tried to find him everywhere and the light had to go now. Come on I will go this side and you go and see that side. Come on Anita. Whenever he shouts something happens. What are you saying? The day uncle went into coma.. ..when the driver was killed and when Suresh fell in the water tank. It seems that there is some secret behind his screaming. We should find that boy. Suresh.. Where are you? - Suresh.. Where are you, son? - Where are you? Suresh. - Suresh. Suresh.. Suresh, where are you son? Are you playing hide and seek? Ramesh.. Ramesh.. Ramesh.. Suresh is found. He is here. Come out. Did you find this place to hide? Uncle, aunt and everyone else is finding you. Come out. We are finding you in the entire house and you are sitting here. Come out. I will not spare you today. You have troubled me a lot. How many times have I told you not to scare the child and smile? But that fool does not understand. Where has Ravi gone? Ravi, Ravi.. - Where are you? Ravi. - I am here. I got scared when I couldn't see you. I am fine but your brother is in problem. What are you saying? Blood.. This blood.. Someone dragged your brother from here. I could not see the face but whatever I had seen.. ..must be recorded in any of the cameras. What was that? Someone crossed from there. - Even I felt the same. Ravi, play again and check every frame. Freeze. Zoom it. Maya.. Do you know her? She is my sister. Get up quickly. Suresh's father is lost somewhere in the house. Usually women lose lipstick and other make up things.. ..but the women of this house lose their children and husbands. I was dreaming about Sunny Leone.. - What are you doing Komal? Don't you know? After coming back from America he has gone out for the first time. You all sleep. Come on. Did you see? Her husband is lost and she is not bothered. Ramesh had an affair here. When sir came to know then he got him married to this woman. But still that woman did not leave him. He must have gone there. Sleep now. My sister was dear to all of us. She was princess of this house. In other words she was world to us. After her birth my father's life changed. He became very prosperous. From that day every business is named after her. We all loved her a lot. Both the brothers were ready to give our life for her. Wait, I will show you. Wait.. Thank you.. He is my son and wants a job. Sorry, sorry.. When talks about Maya's marriage proposal was going on.. ..then we came to know that.. ..Maya ran away with the manager who takes care of our farms. Father was heartbroken. We tried to find Maya everywhere.. ..but inspite of our efforts we could not find her. Then three years later I had to go to Bangalore for a presentation. And there.. So to summarize this machine combines IMRT and CT scanning technology. It helps us scan deeper and find those hard to reach tumors and treat them. Thank you. Congratulations, very nice demo Murali. Thank you sir. With your support everything will go on well. He really did a nice job. Very nice, excellent. Maya.. Sir, one second. Have you called for a taxi? - We will go by Ola. Maya.. Maya.. You both sit and I will see. I saw you in the hospital today morning. Do you know where all I tried to find you? Don't tell this to father. If he comes to know then he will kill us. If you had told us.. ..that you love this boy I would have got you married with pomp and show. All my desires remained unfulfilled. Thank you, father. Father.. Forgive me, sir. - Stand up son. Why are you calling me sir? Now you can call me father. First time I am eating food made by my daughter. It is very delicious. Thanks. - You have just put a little more salt. Is it? - Make preparations to move. I want my daughter to stay in front of my eyes always. It is different if you are feeling bad to stay with us. Actually I want to name half of my property in Maya's name. When you did not think so much while running from the house.. ..then why are you thinking so much to return back? Come on brother-in-law. I am not thinking but I have some important work. I will come later. You take Maya with you. Okay then you come with us. After marriage I am coming home for the first time.. And I am pregnant also. It is just a matter of two days. Once the work is over we will come. Maya, Maya.. Maya.. Child Maya.. Maya, station has came. - Child Maya. Maya.. - Child Maya.. Child Maya.. Maya, Maya.. The train will go so get down. Maya. Maya. - The train is going. They were supposed to come by this train then why haven't they come. Yes father but I don't know why they haven't come. Maya.. - Just call her. What happened? Ask her. Maya.. Oh, God! - The phone is not reachable. She had said that she would come but she didn't come. I went to house in Bangalore again. But they had shifted from there. First I thought that she might have.. ..gone somewhere because of father's fear. Then I just prayed that she should be fine wherever she is. But today I saw her in this condition.. She had not gone because of your father's fear. They both had come here. But they were asked to get down one station before. Come on get down here. Brother, why did you come on this station? Get down. I will tell you. Relatives can get annoyed on your arrival. That is why father asked me to make you get down one station before. And our house is not far from here. We will reach in just one hour. What happened? It is a second hand car so I think it needs to be pushed. Wait, I will push. Brother, stop the car. Let him come. Wait.. Come inside. What are you doing, brother? Wait..stop.. Brother, why aren't you letting him sit in the car? He is a dog. He has the habit of running behind the car. I was just showing him his position. What did you say? What is it, brother? Did you forget to put the break? Did you forget your position? - What? Krishna. What did you do? - What did you both think? That we will make you both meet our relatives and get disgraced again. What are you doing? Kill him. Maya.. - I will see to her. Maya go from here. - Leave, leave me. It is time for you to die. - Maya, don't worry about me. Run away from here. Save your life. Run. No, leave him. Maya, go.. Go away Maya.. Don't spare him. Don't spare that rascal. Maya, Maya.. Where has he gone? I will find and kill him. He will not remain alive. Hey.. No brother, don't beat me. It is really paining. No brother, don't beat me. It is really paining. Brother, don't beat me. - No. Don't come out. I am pregnant. Don't beat me, brother. This is not my voice. That is not me. Don't do like this. - No, Krishna.. No brother, it is really paining. Krishna.. Krishna, please save me. Where is Maya? Hey, where are you? Come out Maya. If you do not come out then I will chop him off into pieces. If you do not come out then I will kill him. Maya, don't come out. They will kill you. Don't come out. Don't come out. Father.. What are you both doing? - Father. Maya.. - Father, please stop brother. He is my husband, father. Stop them, father. Father, look.. Now forget that man, child. You made a big mistake so you have to repent for it. Father, how can you do like this? I request you. - Maya. Maybe you forgotten that we have dignity and position in the village. Sir, kill me if you wish but let Maya go. How can I let her go, son? First, she was alone but now she is carrying your child. Yes father, not for us but at least spare us for our child. That is the cause of the entire problem, child. I have brought you up with so much love and pampering. That it is why it is difficult to kill you with my hands. I have brought poison for you. Drink this and do me a favor, child. I request you to drink this, child. Drink this child. No Maya that is our love. Don't do like this. You promise me that you will spare Krishna. He had refused for marriage but I was adamant. The entire fault is mine. I am ready to drink this poison. But in return you will have to let him go from here. Please. Maya, you are my daughter and I will fulfill your last wish. No Maya, for the sake of our child to be born. Don't drink this poison. They will kill me as well. No Maya. Maya, don't do like this. They are saying lies to you. Maya..leave me. Maya, Maya.. Maya.. Child… Maya child, forgive me. Kill him also. He has dared to love my daughter. Father you had promised that you will not kill him. If I have not spared you then how can I spare him? Stop it. - Leave me. I am telling you top leave me. I believed you but you cheated me. I will not spare you. I will kill your entire family. Hasn't she died yet? Maybe a child of low caste is being brought up in his womb. But the blood of high caste runs in Maya's blood.. ..that is why she is still alive. Take both of them and bury them in a lonely place. I cannot see all that. I am going. Under the effect of intoxication.. ..driver revealed the secret to carpenter. I came to know this from him. And Maya considers you as the biggest culprit. But I have not harmed her at all. Now you and Suresh are the heir of this family. And Maya wants to kill you both. If you don't mind then I can talk to my uncle. He is a great priest. He can control the spirits. It will just take half an hour. Everyone come here. Some people from the village have come. Greetings, son. - Greetings. Actually the thing that there is prayer offering in Goddess's temple. Your father is head of this village. And he had to perform this offering. But since he is unwell.. ..so his elder son will have to perform this offering. But he has gone to city for some important work. But how can I do this? - Brother, you go. Now we will take your leave. Everyone will be waiting in the temple. Okay I will come. But listen to me. Let me meet him. - Try to understand madam. He has heart problem.. ..and he has been just discharged from hospital yesterday. Doctor has advised him to rest for few days. Under such condition how can he offer prayers? No problem. We will leave. Stop. Wait. Make preparations for the offering. But priest, your health is not good. These people have come with great hope. We will have to help them. For this ritual you will have to take the sacred water of this river.. ..and take it to the middle of the temple and make it flow. Now it is fine. Now you can move towards the temple. I agree that injustice happened with Maya but.. ..will she kill her brother and nephew. Till the anger of her revenge does not cool down.. ..she will keep killing people. She was pregnant when she was killed. Because of this she became all the more angry. [Religious chants] [Religious chants] [Religious chants] [Religious chants] [Religious chants] This offering is being made after many years. That is why it has its special importance this time. People from neighboring villages have come here in different outfits. In some time there will be a crowd of people here. [Religious chants] [Religious chants] Religious chants. Religious chants. Because of this offering to fire all spirits are coming here. They are the ones who were killed forcefully. Wait. You are not the one whom we are waiting for. We can only call those spirits that are not in peace. I did not understand. Spirits may be very strong but cannot do anything on its own. Human body is very necessary to control it. Maya has also entered body of any one of you. Priest Acharay has finalized sunrise as an auspicious time. At that time great offering to fire will start. He has also said that everything should happen in this auspicious time. At that time great offering to fire will also begin. The flame of offering will go quite high. When the flame of offering will reach very high.. ..then people from the top of the temple will throw water. With that water Goddess will be consecrated. Then the power of Goddess will be awakened. Tomorrow a great offering to fire will be done in Goddess's temple. Before the offering to fire is over that spirit will remain powerful. And tomorrow she will try to take revenge. We have to find out the body in which she is residing. What will we have to do? First find out and then I will come myself. After so many days we are drinking. There is no fragrance in alcohol. If you want fragrance then you can drink my body spray. We have got it after so many days so enjoy drinking. Water.. What is sister doing there? Has ring fallen down in the well? You killed, you killed.. Did you kill him? For so many days you are killing people. Come on call everyone. Why are you opening your mouth to eat Idli? Scream and call everyone. You will not be able to do it as you are drunk. She is standing draped in red Sari.. ..as if she has to perform role of a bride and has come for shooting. But.. I am running but why aren't I going ahead. Who is she? - She might be her friend. Is she a friend or a riddle? She should be staying in her house and not in her body. - She is coming, master. - Stay there. Hey.. Otherwise after seven rounds we would have been married to her. I will remain unmarried all my life. Stop. Tell us the reason for slapping us. He has gone mad. We have not done anything and still we are being slapped. If you are really a witch.. ..and have been brought up among ghosts then beat him. I am gone. I trusted him for so many years and he cheated me. By beating me your value in the market will be reduced. You made a mitake. - Child. Maya, forgive me. I made a big mistake, child. Forgive me. Because of your false pomp show and dignity.. ..you killed my husband and my child mercilessly. And now you are begging for kindness. Beg for kindness from those who serve you. They will save you. Save me, child. I beg for kindness from you. With this poison I saw a father destroying the child of his daughter. Today I am making you drink the same poison. It is daughter's duty to repay what father has done.. ..and I will fulfill that duty. Master I don't know why but.. ..my body is really aching. - You are right. After drinking cheap alcohol head should be paining. But why is the body paining. Now I know the reason. - What? Under the effect of intoxication we have beaten someone badly. We beat someone and our body is paining. And how much would be his body paining, whom we have beaten. The lemon will tell about the spirit. How can this happen? This.. - This is a very powerful lemon. If uncle has said then it must be true. Did you see Murali, your brother has still not returned. Yes, sister-in-law. From the time he has returned from America, he is not bothered anyone. Only waiting is there in my destiny. That means the spirit is in sister-in-law's body. Whose? That of Maya. I will tell you when the time is right. For now stay away from sister-in-law. I will tell about this to rest of the family members. The spirit is not in your sister-in-law's body.. ..but in the body of my sister. What do you mean? This did not turn black from the side sister-in-law came. But it became black from the side my sister Anita came. I have made the matter more complicated. Good that she knows we doubt sister-in-law. Within next one hour we will have to take Anita away from this house. Why so? What are you saying? There is ghost in sister-in-law's body. This cannot happen. If you do not believe then look at the marks of her feet. Oh God. One foot straight and one backward. How would she be wearing slippers? Physician. I am dead. She is calling me. Go, she is calling you. Why is this witch taking attendance like school teacher? Physician, come quickly. Come with me if you wish to. I will have to go if she is calling me. The ghost is calling. - Come on let's go. Come on. [Religious chants] Why are you saying it wrong? [Religious chants] The ghost is chanting the chant that keeps the ghost away. It is difficult to escape from her. Your disciple had given me medicine for hair. - Okay. But from the time I have started applying.. ..my hair are falling at a great speed. Then we will have to call her bald ghost. Did you find this ghost to sell fake oil? Which is the oil? I do not know the name but it seems to be groundnut oil. Groundnut oil? I will change it. The disciple? - No, I will change the oil. Who are you? I am Manju's uncle. I have come for the festival of the temple. She said she was doing duty here so that is we came to meet you. We are already not feeling well because of entry of witch in the house. Tell Manju that her uncle has come. Okay madam. Please come. What happened? Nothing. Don't misbehave in the restaurant. Come on. - Be careful while going. Aren't you coming, sister-in-law? - No, I have a head ache. From the time you have come you have not moved out of the house. Come on, let's go have dinner out today. If she is refusing then you do not be persistent. Take us along. - We will also come with you. We cannot stay alone in this big house with sister-in-law. Okay, you also come along. Come on let's go. - Come on. They have come, priest. Let's go. Come on. Isn't your uncle coming for dinner? He has already finished his dinner. Today she must have eaten all of us. Bus without a conductor. Hey..come back. It will be breezy. Not cool breeze but I will feel giddy. I feel giddy in the bus. Wait, I am coming. What will I do alone in the house? Now you will kill us mercilessly. By sitting in AC hotel you will not spare us. What should I do? - Now you will not be spared. Muthu had said that they were buried somewhere here. But even I do not know the exact place. Sister-in-law I request you to sit behind.. ..it is very breezy and comfortable. Why should I sit there? I will sit here and gossip with you. It will be real fun. While gossiping with me she will kill me. I am not sitting with my boyfriend but with a ghost. What happened? Nothing, the seat is small for me. What nonsense is this? The size of the seat is the same. It has become smaller after you sat on it. You are my favorite sister. Shall I sit with you? Religious Chants. With the help of this coconut we will be able to find the place.. I am dead. - What happened? ..and is pressing my neck with her long sharp nails. Does the witch have extra time? Let me see. It is a nail whom this old man is thinking to be her nails. I should take advantage of the situation. Uncle, if you want to be saved from death then promise me.. What promise? That you will not get your sister married to me. This old man changed his decision. The fear of death can cause change in decisions. I will get another sister but not life. Fine, fine. Hold my hand tightly. - Okay. First I will recite a chant.. ..and then will blow air and then as soon as I do that you jump. What? The moment you blew that hand left me. You seem to be a specialist to make the ghosts run away. Let's together make the ghost run away rather than only her hand. The chant for making the ghost run is just like one time password. Are you feeling hungry? Anita, cut an apple for her. I am sorry Anita. Suddenly the hotel came so I had to put break. You all go inside and give order. Suresh and I will park the car and come. - Okay. Take me along. - You too go and I will come with them. You are my safety guard. I will not go without you. Come on. Let's go. I think she will eat both of us for dinner. What did you say? I said that I have come here many times. What will you take, madam? Get all the non veg that is there in the hotel. Okay madam. Let's go. - Where? You go alone. Come quickly. I cannot control. Let's go. I am dead. You all are thinking that the spirit is in me.. ..but it is actually in Anita's body. She is saying the truth. Maya's ghost is in Anita. She should not come to know that we all know about it. Uncle at home is a great priest. He has come here to make this ghost vanish. On his saying Murali has gone to him to hand over.. ..the handkerchief stained with Anita's blood. We will have to put this magical ink on Anita's head at any cost. Are you there? Now I am at ease. What was the need to hold the Sari? What if you had left? I feel scared alone. That is why I had caught hold of your Sari. Madam, soup. Some people urinate because of fear of ghost but your sister took ghost for going to toilet. It is good that the ghost went and sat there. Where are you going? Why hasn't Murali come? - He will not go anywhere. But you sit here with me as you are my safety guard. Sit and give me company. My sister is innocent. Without knowing the truth she might say.. ..something to the ghost and get trapped in some problem. If you call her then she will die of heart attack. Look, that ghost is proposing me. She still thinks that you are a ghost. Wait, I will call you. You leave it. Let me handle this case. I am trying to save her life and she is.. ..giving me expression like a secret heroine. I think my patience has paid. He is calling me out. You wait here for two minutes and I will be back in half an hour. Without any interruption we have got a romantic opportunity today. Give me a long kiss. Stop talking nonsense. You are sitting with Anita and there is ghost of Maya in her body. Maya's.. Don't scream like this otherwise I will die of fear. Not only this. You have to do one more thing. What? You have to put this magical ink on her head. Okay. - No, no. You want me to put this ink in her parting of hair. Old woman.. - No, I will not do this. You will have to. You start it and I will remain with you. Okay, then I will do. I will stay but you will not remain. Oh God save me from the trouble. What happened? -There was a fly. I did not see. He is not Rajnikant that he will come and stand in front. Now will not be spared. My brother's head has got stuck. I think he is dead because of your stunt. Brother… Master.. - What is it? Another ghost is ready. No, no her soul has vanished. Did you see the man who was driving this van and came here? I do not know. He left with the child long back. Hurry up, she is leaving. Wait, the soul of this old man is in our hands. Start digging here. She is driving very fast. She flies faster than the soul. Don't waste time. Go and put the ink on her head. How can I go? - Hurry up and go. Thank you. Who put chili sauce on my cheek? - I hope you enjoyed. I waited 25 years for this. I will sleep if you do this. What are you talking? - Go and sit back. You are stinking. Madam, stop the car for a minute. I want to urinate. Sister, he stinks even after applying perfume.. ..so think how much he will stink after urinating. Save me. I am dead. Go, go quickly. Hey, don't come back before one hour. Take your time. Why has the breeze stopped? Why did the car stop? He seems to be a nonsense driver. Whose turn is it now? - What turn? To put this ink. You have still not been able to do this work. As if it is very easy for you. I have put, I have put it. Why are you staring at me, fool? Did you think we will get scared? I have already set right 36 ghosts like you. Last warning. It is a good opportunity to run away otherwise you will repent. Do you know who is sitting behind me? He is a hopeless doctor for human beings. But he is a great surgeon for ghosts and witches. Show her your face. Where has everyone gone? Till now you must have seen a ghost slapping a man. But today she is kicking in WWF style. - He is gone. Brother is gone. Brother is gone.. I am dead. Aren't you scared of me? Tell me the name of the person who told you this. Don't beat me so much otherwise I will urinate. Hug me. I am feeling very scared. And on seeing you I feel like vomiting. Did you call me fool? I was just joking. In fact I am a fool. I am moving round and round. What condition has she done of my brother? He is looking like number 8 The soul has come to know about this. She will not come here. And she will go straight home to find them. This child is not at all at fault. Spare him. Do not do like this. You wait here and I will be back soon. Priest. At last the sin has ended, priest. This is not the end but the beginning. There is only one remedy to free that soul. I will give you a Trishul.. ..and you will have to attack with that on Maya's body. But Maya will attack with her hand. How is this possible? - Any spirit can control anybody. And then to fulfill her goal it enters that body. But it is not possible that the spirit always wins. A time comes when that spirit loses. The soul of your sister is not that powerful.. ..that it can defeat Maya's soul. When this good and bad soul unites.. ..then destruction of a living or a dead person is for sure. That means even if the good soul wins there is always a possibility.. ..that the living body will be completely destroyed. That means someone will have to put his body at stake. There is no option other than this. Is there any human being who is ready to take such a big risk? I am ready. Now pray to God that whatever happens is good. [Religious chants] Her soul has entered your body. Try to control it. Now with that Trishul attack the dead body. Do not delay. Hurry up. Hurry up. Pick up the Trishul and attack. Come, don't let that bad soul become powerful than you. Come. ♪ [Religious chants] ♪ Come. Don't delay. The security of that family is in your hands. Come. ♪ Religious chants. ♪ Come quickly. Come! Come! Hail to Lord Shiva. Call the ambulance and take him home quickly. Hurry up. The moment the soul enters the body burn it. Take it. Hail to Lord Shiva. - Priest, priest.. What happened? - What will we do now? What happened? Are you okay? Why are you quiet? Why aren't you talking? Say something. Now I cannot do anything. God will help you. Reach the temple. What will I do without you? Go. Goddess will help you. Come. Uncle.. - Are you fine? - Hey Murali has come. - Where were you? I am late in coming. Let's start the offering. Still 10 minutes remain for the auspicious time. We cannot start the offering before that. Only some time is left your good soul will control the bad soul. And then you can get whatever done from it. Listen.. Go, go.. Wait.. Come here. Uncle.. He will sit ahead. No problem. Come in front. - So Ravi, when will we meet again? I will have to go to Kerala for an urgent shoot. Once the shooting is over I will come. I promise. - Okay. Take care. Bye, Anita. - Bye, brother. Take care of yourself. How come you are here? How will you cover such a long distance alone? I thought of giving you company. Manju, Manju.. There is no girl in my destiny and no money in my pocket. I am at loss. My dear brother-in-law, shall I send my sister with you? Hey, old man your sister cheated and my father married someone else. I was born after that marriage. I am leaving. Before leaving drink sweet milk from my hand. She will not spare me. Here, I drank it. Now go. Good bye. He drank it. I waited for you for 25 years. And you got married and gave birth to a child. What did you think that I will forget easily? To take revenge for that cheating I had added poison in your milk. Hey, old woman if you were married on the right time then.. ..your child would be as old as mine. If you are ready to marry my sister then I have a remedy for this poison. Make me drink another cup but I will not marry her. I will keep following you till you die. I will stay with you. - Yes, great idea. ~By Zeus~
