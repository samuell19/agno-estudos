And once we hit it, Madison and I are going to get blackout drunk again on camera like we did for 1,000 but no vodka shots this time. We're going to stick to the rosé all day, every day. So yeah, that is it. Hi, guys. Welcome back. So today, we are going to be going on our river. Well, yeah, it's not our river, but we're going to go on to our annual river trip. And I am super, super, super excited. But I also, I don't know, feeling a little-- Yeah, I don't know. I guess it's going to be different and a little weird this year without-- OK, well, I'll show you. So this is 100% going to be the strangest unboxing video that I've ever done. And yeah, so Chuy actually made it just in time for the trip. And we have his urn-- Yeah, there's a little note from his mom here, so. Yo, you ready? You scare the shit out of me. What is this? Chuy. What's up, bro? Hey, was that recording? Are you still doing this vlog shit? Come on. You only ever get one view. Come on, we got stuff to do. Let's go. Let's get going. Love you. You guys all know that we got like at least 100 views on the last video. So yeah, little, little Jackson doesn't know because he actually barely watches these. But we love him, right? Yeah, we do. He's lucky he's cute. Oh, here stand like that. Hop to the river. Hop to the river. [inaudible] Girl, I love your extensions. Thanks. I love your sweet little face, Maddie. We should totally do a tutorial on why you put those in. I bet that would crush. Come on, guys. Let's go. Nice to see you too, Dee. This is going to be [inaudible]. All right, ladies, next stop, Monte Rio, T-minus, hella hours. I hope everybody went to the bathroom, too, because I'm not changing that black water. OK, whatever, dad.

And plus, he would have wanted us to do this, anyway. 100%. I mean, he loved this trip more than anyone. Remember, when he brought that slingshot and he was launching beers at people as this [inaudible].. Man, classic Chuy. Totally. So why wouldn't he want us to keep it going. I'm just saying he should be here. Well, here he is. Chuy, going to miss you there, bro. There's two extra cases. Natty ice are going to miss him, too. Those few extra bumps, too. Hey, guys, chill. We all party a little bit too hard. It's not Chuy's fault he had a problem. It's a disease. Mental illness, self medication. OK, Dr. Phil, how many credits did JC have again, like five? More than you, Mr. Welcome to speedy change. Here we go back in I'm the one person in this car who has a job. All right, guys, let's see if you're talking to that trash when I go by the alcohol, all right? By the way, are we buying stuff for Blake and Zola? Hell no. Blake is on his own. Why the fuck is Zola bring him anyway? They're supposed to be broken up. Baby-mama drama. Yeah, mommy and daddy can be YO. Still can't believe they have a kid. Wonder who's going to watch it while they're gone. Not in it, Dee. You make Thea sound like they're a dog or something. Just ew. They totally have a kid. Yeah, I don't know, it makes me feel like old. Blake is old. He's like 26. Blake's hot, though. Totes. Too bad he's a douche. Hey. Blake's my boy. I like him. No, it's true, Jackson. Blake's kind of a douche. He's certainly not you. Ew, get a room. [music playing] All right, guys. We made it. Oh. Don't even. OK. Hurry up, let's go. We are. Auntie Kali. Hey, guys. Zola. Hey. Hey. You brought Thea. Yeah, my mom's on some self-determination bullshit, says if I want to have some fun, then I'm going to have to take on my own responsibility or whatever. Hey, Dee. Hey. Yo, ladies, y'all going to help me with the shit or what? Allow me, miss. Thank you dear, sir. Yeah, real fucking chivalrous assholes. Kali, is it 2,000 yet? Not yet but when I do, we're going to get fucked up. Mad, I'm filming. Is that OK? Yeah, you should see my Tinder. This is nothing. No, it's all good. I'll turn it off. Speaking of 2,000, you subscribed, right Dee? I-- I haven't gotten to it yet. What? Dee, are you serious? I'm busy studying for my LSATs. School has been super busy. Yeah, it's all good. I know you have your own shit going on. No, Dee that's fucked up. Kali's really trying to make something of herself here. She's putting herself out there, and she's actually really good. I'm not saying that you need to help her with her vids like I do. But you could at the least be supportive. I am supportive. Does that mean I have to watch her videos? I mean, I feel like that's a pretty good way to support her. No, I can be supportive by not doing that-- Like how? By just being her friend. In what way or-- Mad, it's OK, We're best friends, Dee. Why would I need you to subscribe? It's all good, Kali. You are just one viral bit away from being a star. I just know it. Thanks, babe. Why do you even care, Madison? It's not going to be you who's Insta famous. I'm not allowed to want to help my friend? Yeah, sure. You can do that. I just don't see what's in it for you. You're fucked for that, Dee. I just want to see Kali succeed. Not everyone is just out for themselves. And what's that supposed to mean? Nothing. I'm just saying. Oh, really? I feel like you have more to say to add to that. Hey. OK. Let's all just relax and get back to the real world. OK? [laughter] You're so annoying. Let's get drunk. Never. Just drink.

I wouldn't if I were you. We do it every year. This year is different. The river has been taking people, certain people. Like who? Like your friend. Chuy? I don't know his name. He seemed like a nice kid. Come back next year. How about you come back when you get your fucking shirt clean, buddy? I'm warning you. Do not float the river. Whatever, old man.

The river was just there. It didn't take shit. I guess. I don't know. Why would he just say that? Because he's a fucking tweak or some shit. I don't know. Look, OK, the river has no current. It's like two feet deep. The only thing dangerous on this river is that, to be honest with you. [laughter] Yeah, probably. Fuck, now, I'm scared of him. You know, I'll protect you. Put on some music.

Isn't he cute? Yo, Kali, turn that shit off. So you guys, things got a little bit messy last night to say the least. But that's OK. Today is going to be wild.

I can't just leave her in the bathroom for five hours. Oh, shit, dude. I thought I told you not to float the river. Yeah. And I thought we told you to fuck off, bro. Blake, get back in the car. Yo, what's up, old man? We're going to have a fucking problem? You're going to have a problem if you float the river just like your friend Chuy. Hey, get our friend's name out of your fucking mouth, bro. You know shit about him. You think you know how he died? Jackson, this is fucked. Get back in the car. You think he overdosed? Man, shut the fuck up, you potbellied sister fucking hick. Go back to your trailer and eat some fucking pork rinds before I whoop your fucking ass, you understand me? I'll fucking knock you off the concrete. It's not my problem then. Yeah. Well, leave us the fuck alone or we'll be your fucking problem. Fuck out of here. What the fuck, Blake? Hey, babe. Chill, chill. We got this. Let's go get some fucking tacos. What's up, brother? What can I get for you? I'll have three carne asada, please. Actually, we're all vegan. OK. We'll just get some chicken. Yeah, three chicken. Yeah, please. So you guys, this creepy groundskeeper dude is actually trying to kill us like irl. Yo, that dude is a fick. Straight up, bro. That dude's a fucking 100% dumbass, right? I don't know. Maybe the creepy dude is right. Like maybe it's a sign or an omen. What do you mean an omen? Like maybe this isn't the year to float the river with Chuy and all. I mean he obviously knows the family. Plus, I feel like I'm at barf from last night. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, not in the hellcat. Are you fucking kidding me? You can barf from the fucking river. Yo, are you filming this, too? I don't know why.

You know, they caught an 8-foot sturgeon around here last year. Gross. Is it going to eat us? No, bud. We're going to eat it. No one told me that there's creatures in this water. Oh, don't worry, they're more afraid of you than you are of them. Am I supposed to be offended? Yeah, low key. I wonder if there are monsters in this river, too. No, sweetie. There's no such thing as monsters. You're right. I'm always right. Yeah, this is nice. I do miss Chuy, though. Yeah, I do, too. I just wish there was more that we could have done for him. You were a good friend to him. He was lucky to have someone like you in his life. Ew, ew, ew, ew. There's something on my leg. Ew, get it off, Zola, here. Get it off. I'll get these off. Ew. I thought this was supposed to be more scared of me. I guess you might have sweet blood. Yo, where's Thea? What? What do you mean what? I gave her to you. I swear she was just right here. Are you fucking kidding me? Thea? Thea! Thea! Thea! Thea! I swear to God, when we find her, I'm taking her from you. You can't fucking control her. It's not good for her, and it's not safe. What do you think I've been doing by myself for the past five years? Well, it's a miracle she's gotten this far. Oh, my god. Oh, my god, Blake. I see her. I see her. Oh, my god. Oh, my god. Man, Dee, she's so jelly of you, she forgot her own kid. Seriously, I don't know why they're still together. I can't believe Dee had leeches. Ew. I totally had leeches. Sounds like an STI. Ew. Oh, baby. Wait. Do you have a condom? I have leeches. That's hot. Ew. Blake? Hello? Thea? Thea? Blake? Blake? Zola. Blake? It was supposed to be a friend weekend. I can't believe they brought her. Madison. Yeah, I hope they find Thea. Should've just duck gone down the river or something. I don't know. Blake, Blake, Blake. Zola, stop. Relax, relax, relax. I saw-- I saw-- Zola, Zola, relax. Where's Thea? Oh, my god. What? You don't have her? What the fuck, Zola? What are you doing here? They killed Blake. What do you mean they killed Blake? I saw it with my own eyes. There's something in those woods. That's OK. I'll go find her. That thirsty? Madison, someone just died. Bullshit. You really believe this bitch? Look at her. She's fucking hammered. Are you sure? Yeah, no problem. I'll go with her. It's fine. Jackson, I'm scared. Can you stay here with us? Maybe Maddie can go. Fuck that. It's OK, guys. I'll go see if I can find Thea. Hey, we're not that far from the cabin. If I find her, we'll just go there. What if Blake actually did get killed? No, I'm with Maddie. There's no way Blake is dead. I love you. Shut up, Kali. See you in like five minutes. Hi, guys. So things have kind of gone downhill since last time we chatted. We lost Thea. And Zola is convinced that something happened to Blake. I don't know. Do you think that something actually happened to Blake? Maybe it was that creepy groundskeeper dude from this morning. But yeah, I don't know. She's like catatonic. And I'm going to be live streaming all day so be sure to like, share-- Jackson, read the room, the girl's in shock. Jackson's right here. Zola? Zola? Zola! Zola! Zola, what the fuck? Zola. We have to do something. I know but what's in there? Do you think it's a sturgeon? No, where did she go? Zola! Zola! Oh, my god, Zola. Shit. What the fuck? Jackson! Jackson! Jackson! You see her? Fuck, I can't find her. Fuck! where the fuck did she go? Jackson! Oh, my god. Oh, fuck it's hot. Get out. Oh, my god. Fuck. Guys, get the fuck to shore. Thea? Oh, my god. What the fuck? Guys, I can't get a signal. What are we going to do? Oh, my god, Zola. It's Chuy's soul. He's come back to haunt us. You spaz, ghosts aren't real. Yeah, some people thought that coronavirus wasn't real, and it still killed them. Even if Chuy was a ghost, he was our best friend. Why would he come back and do this to us? I don't know. Maybe he's mad at us that we weren't there for him, that we didn't try to help him more. I mean, whatever it is. We got to do it now. Do what? [music playing] You know-- No, not like this. Maybe it's the only way to put him to rest. [music playing] I'll do it. [music playing] Chuy-- Chuy, I'm sorry that you were depressed. And I'm sorry that you felt the need to self medicate. And that's all that defined your death. But it's not what defined your life. You're the life of the party. And you are the brightest face in every room. And you never said a single bad thing about anyone even when Maddie and I would have our epic shit talking sessions. You held us together, Chuy. And now, you're gone. Then we are falling apart. And I know that wherever you are, you would be trying to help us. And you wouldn't try and hurt us, because you were a good person even though we weren't there for you when we should have been, and that fucking sucks. We're so sorry. We love you, Chuy. Are you sure? Yeah, I would not get back on that inner tube if it was Justin Bieber's big beautiful dick. Gross, Mad. OK, take care of yourself. I love you. I love you, Kali Fyre. All right. I have the girl. No, no, no. Stop. She's safe. I can take you to her, but you have to be quiet. You're in danger if you don't. You haven't vlog since-- Yeah. I hadn't even thought about it. It's been nice. It's just you and me, no phone, no viewers to act for. I'm not acting when I vlog. I'm just being me. Yeah, but it's like a version of you. What do you mean? It's like I've known you for 10 years and then there's the real you. And then there's the Kali Fyre you. And those two aren't the same people. You don't think I know that, Jackson? You don't think that I feel like a fraud every time I hit that record button, or do you think I'm so frigging awkward about it? So why do you even do it? I don't know. Maybe it's something that I just have to do, makes me feel important, gives me a voice. Yeah, but you should talk about other important stuff like going premed and all that. Like what happened to that? People change. I'm not really sure I like this change. Are you trying to tell me that you don't like my vlog? Is that it? I thought you knew that I didn't like your vlog. I always tell you that I don't like it. I thought you were kidding. But why would I be kidding? It's been three years since we graduated. And everybody else is making moves. And you were just going to be 40, like making makeup tutorials or something? Geez. I'm sorry. No, no, no, you want to talk about it, clearly. So let's talk about it. Do you need me to say it out loud? No, that's fine. That way you can hear how ridiculous it sounds, because I'll do it. Yeah? OK, sweet. Let's go. I want to be Instagram famous when I grow up. I want to get that blue checkmark. And I want to ride this wave until it's over. And I want to get paid to try makeup that cosmetics company sent to me. And I want to get paid to rosé all day. And I want to vlog from tropical beaches, not some fucking-- Some fucking what? No. Say it. Never mind. Say it. Come on, you don't want to be like at a white trash river float with all your friends like you are right now. No. That's not what I meant. But you didn't have to. It's like Kali Fyre's too good for her and all of her friends. I guess-- It's not what it's about. She's not really worth with her friends. Jackson. What? Like no, it's honestly-- Jackson. The truth, though. Jackson Jackson! Are you OK? Yeah, I think so. We're almost there. In there? What is it? It's a safe place. Can't she just come out here? It's pretty cold in there. Take this. Thea? Mom? No, it's Dee. Your mom's friend. Thea. Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Yeah, let's float. Yeah, let's float. Yeah, that's real, real smart. Let's just go float on the death river. Fuck that. I'm gonna be dry. Gonna get service. Somebody's going to pick me up. [inaudible] [music playing] No, no, no. [music playing] Where are my parents? Is something wrong? Thea, sometimes being an adult is just really hard. You know, your mommy and daddy love you very much. Yes, they argue sometimes but not about you. And then what's it about? How about grown up stuff, sweetie? Is that why my dad left? Your daddy will never really leave you. Have you ever done a pinky swear? No. Well, maybe but I don't think I remember it. Do you know why we do it? No. Well, to promise something. Oh. And you know why we use our pinky fingers? Well? Well, you know how we've been floating on this river? I didn't want to go but my dad made me. I know, sweetie. But do you remember how we put the tubes on the river and it flowed down? Yeah. Well, our arteries are like little tiny rivers carrying blood from your heart to everywhere it needs to go. It's going to your feet, going to your knees, your eyes. It went to my butt? Yes, even to your butt. You know something. But little kids, those rivers don't end at the tips of their pinky fingers. The little kids are special. They have an invisible river that flows out from their pinky fingers to their moms and their dad's pinky fingers no matter where they are. In these invisible rivers, they flow to your parents veins and into your parents hearts so that no matter what, you'll always be in their hearts forever. Even when they die? Yeah, it's forever, the pinky swear. [music playing] Let's just get the fuck out of here. Shit. What? Oh, shit. What? My keys, they were never in here. OK, well, where are they then? Oh, fuck. What, Jackson? Shit. What? I left them in the center console, the raft. The center console-- it's not a fucking car, Jackson. I know. I'm so fucking dumb. OK, we have to go back. They must have dumped out in the Rapids. Yeah, well, I'll go upstream and try to find them. That'll be useless. It's almost dark. What other choice do we have? What about Dee? What if she found Thea? It's getting dark. I'll only go as far as the rapids. At least let me come with you. It's scary up there. You're safer here. You should stay. OK, please be careful. I will. I love you. I love you, too. [music playing] Well, here I am in some random fucking parking lot. I started the day out with my boyfriend and three of my best friends. I don't know if you'll see it but Zola disappeared. And we think she-- I'm not even going to say it. Madison could have been picked up by some psycho by now. And who the fuck knows where Dee went? And Thea, I don't know if I can know about Thea. All just like-- It's all just too much. And now, my mascara's smearing. That was supposed to be waterproof, so. Hello? [inaudible] Jackson? Jackson, is that you? Jackson? Help me. Madison! Madison! Madison! Madison, what happened? I fell on a stone. I saw the guy. What guy? Who-- what? How'd you even pass the rapids? What rapids? Never mind. Never mind. We got to-- we got to get you some help. Chuy? Chuy, what are you talking about? I thought you OD'd and fell into the river. I hadn't taken that much before. I know you're trying to reach out to me. I was trying to give you tough love or some shit. I should have been there for you. I was too busy focusing on my stupid vlog shit. No, it's not your fault. It's the river. It took me. And now, it's trying to take all of you. It preys on your weaknesses. Why do you even care, Madison? You still doing this vlog shit? Not everyone is just out-- I saw you guys out. I don't have time for-- Move your fucking ass. It preyed on mine. Don't go near the river. What the actual fuck? Here, you good? Yeah, I'm OK. Hey, Jackson. Yeah? Remember I told you I'd kill you earlier. Yeah, I do. I'm not going to kill you. You're actually a good guy. I'm glad you're dating my best friend. I'm glad you're my girlfriend's best friend. [music playing] It's safe-- Jackson, Jackson, Jackson. Jackson! Jackson! Hold on. Jackson! Jackson! Hold on. Jackson! Madison! Madison! Jackson! I have your friend and the girl. They're safe. What about the rest of them? There is another girl. Maddie? She's about my age walking down this road. They're of the river. They're off the river? Of the river. Hell does that mean? It means I can't help them. But I can help you. Let me take you there. I have to find my friends-- And Mace. OK. You don't happen to have an iPhone charger, do you? Can you at least tell me where we're going? To see your friend and the girl. Yeah, you told me that. But where? I'm going to jump out of this fucking car if you don't tell me where we're going. I warned you not to float the river. So what, you're trying to punish us for not listening to you? It's not me. OK, well then who? Not who, what. What are you talking about? There is something in that river. It took your friend Chuy. I don't know how many others. I tried to save as many of your friends as I could. Do you think you're immune from reality? You're not. We're here. It's in here. Hey, thank you. I know that we can be selfish sometimes. And-- We made it really, really hard for you. I appreciate you still trying to help us. Hello? Hello? Wait. Auntie Kali. Dee. What the heck, Dee? He was trying to help us. What? Do you mean by killing Blake and walking us in a shack? My god, Dee. I'm so sorry. It got Zola, too. There's something out there. Yeah, there was. Now, it's dead. I don't think it was him, Dee. OK. All right, let's go, motherfucker. Dee, come back here. Come on. Dee. Come on. Come back here. Hello? Dee, please be quiet. Come and get me. I'm right fucking here. Dee. Come and get me. Come back here-- Hello? Now. Dee? Thea, I need to see how fast you can run. OK? How about we do this and see who wins? OK. Let's do a race. Ready, set, go. My mom has one of these. But yeah, I don't know she's like catatonic. Zola. Zola, Zola. Don't go near the river.
