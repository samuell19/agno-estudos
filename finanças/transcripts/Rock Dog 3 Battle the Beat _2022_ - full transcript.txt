Oh, they look fantastic! I know, right? It's like I'm a whole new me. Dad, wolves don't attack sheep anymore. Those were the old days. It's a new era. You're the best, Larry. It's all coming together. Best friends forever! Hey, good to see you again. You're gonna teach Tai Chi, huh? It has many health benefits. So, Bodi, how long you back in town? A little while. That last tour was exhausting. We're taking a break. If you're lookin' to make a little extra money, I could use someone to sweep up the clippings. Nah, huh? Look, it's Angus Scattergood. Ladies and gentlemen, please join me and my new best friend who I've never met before, Neon... -Lyte. -Is that your real name? Oh, I like that. It says Neon Lyte. So it's quite clever, see. Hey Angus, why don't you tell the peeps what our new show, "Battle the Beat", is all about. Well, "Battle the Beat" is a musical talent discovery show. Now you might say, "I've heard of that before" but not like this because this time each week we coach a musical act. Now you might say you heard that before, but not like this because they will battle each week for biscuits or points or soot or asparagus, whichever they choose and it culminates with a very ostentatious finale, which means final in French, in which a winner will get a mega deal recording contract! -Whoa! -Really? -Shh! -So get on it, Jack, download the app, watch on your device, and it'll be cooler than ice. Yeah, just what he said, Jack. Uh, who's Jack? -What's the Wi-Fi password? -I don't have the password. I can't believe Angus is doing this show. Why? It looks like fun. It's a shortcut. The contestants aren't willing to pay their dues. They just want overnight success. I don't even know if they care about the music. But it has celebrity coaches and lots of sparkly stuff. I'm downloading the app. It wants access to my location and contacts. That's okay, right? - Pardon me! - Hey! Coming through. Excuse me! Coming through! Move aside, would ya? Is it true? Is it true? The moment I heard about it, I came running. Whoa, Hazel, calm down. What's going on? I just heard an unsubstantiated rumor from a totally unreliable source, but there was a near wolf attack this morning. No, it was nothing. I misread the situation. Oh. You look disappointed. You realize this isn't natural, right? Sheep and wolf fraternizing together. It's not the way it's supposed to be. And Khampa, look at yourself. You're a mastiff. You're supposed to be all eyes on the target, ready to protect and defend at any moment and you're not! Oh, you've gone soft and not comfy pillow soft. You're like mushy bruised banana soft. Hazel, things are different. -Times have changed. -Different? How about boring? How about we're living in peace and harmony? Peace and harmony? Oh! Peace is totally overrated. And harmony is a major buzz kill. There's no action. Oh, look around. There is nothing to do. You can enroll in Khampa's Tai Chi class. Eh, I prefer CrossFit. What can I say, Hazel? Everyone's getting along. Hi-yah! Huh? Ooh. I, um... I like, uh... You like what? Spit it out. I like what you were saying. It's boring around here. Right? Right? I liked the way it used to be. There was tension and excitement! Yeah. Now look at everyone. Eyes glued to their screens, watching all the feel good shows. It makes me sick. There needs to be a show where the characters are mean and nasty. Hmm. Yes! A show that could get everyone excited about conflict again! And once they see what they've been missing-- Wolves and sheep will be enemies once again. Hey, you're pretty smart... for a wolf. Single whip. Cloud hands. I love cloud hands. It's like jazz hands only with clouds. Now right heel kick and carry the tiger over the mountain. Uh, Khampa, Fleetwood fell on Karl again. Um, Khampa? It's time. Time? Time for what? "Battle the Beat." There's only two shows left and the contestants are neck and neck. Really? You guys would rather watch some... Huh? -Dumb TV show. -All right! What? I really like the new host of the show. I particularly enjoy the witty repertoire between the musical coaches. That Lezah's a real game changer. Let's give it up for Tara! Shh, shh, shh, shh! We have heard both contestants sing. Now let's hear what the coaches have to say. Neon. Tara girl, let me tell you, it's a pleasure coaching you. You took that song to another level. I mean, bang, pop, this week you are on top because what we heard from the Angus side, I mean, I know all those years in rock and roll affected your hearing, Angus, but uh, I didn't know you were tone deaf. Zing! That's why they call me the king of zing. Am I right? Am I right, people? Come on, let me hear it. Come on, give it to me now. Angus, are you gonna take that? For someone whose name is Neon Lyte, you're quite a dim bulb, you know. The fact is, you are jealous of me. In fact, you're so green with envy, you should change your name from Neon Lyte to Limelight. Or Big Green Apple Light That Doesn't Really Work and is Envious. Huh? Dad, what are you doing? Bodi, you missed it. Angus just said the funniest thing. I can't believe you stopped class for this. This show is a waste of time. Jealous much? Actually, I was asked to be on the show. Really? Hey, everyone, Bodi's gonna be on "Battle the Beat!" But I turned them down. -What? -Are you crazy? It's a show about music. No, this show isn't about singing. -It's about-- -Zing! Don't forget to join us next time for the grand finale where our two contestants will battle it out and you, the fans, will choose our winner. It will be a night full of excitement, music, and lots of zing! I'm Lezah Lynn. Until next time, you stay in tune. Great show. See you tomorrow and keep those zings coming. ♪ La la la la la la ♪ Hmm. ♪ La la la la la la ♪ ♪ La la la la la la ♪ Uh, 25 degrees centigrade. I clearly said, 26 degrees centigrade. It's freezing in here. It's freezing! Carbonated? I don't want carbonated. I specifically requested cucumber infused spring water. No carbon. Just the non, just the floaty stuff with cucumbers in there. This is a disaster! Huh? Angus? Who put the avocado on a fruit platter? -Huh? -A twit must have done that. Yeah, they should go to Twit School. Hello? Angus? -You there? Can you hear me? -Bodi? Bodi, on the phone! Bodi, Bodi! Ah. Did you call to congratulate me on tonight's show? Well, um-- Angus, the instant ratings are in. Best numbers ever. You are killing it. Keep doing what you do. I don't know what I'm doing, but that's music to my ears. Yeah, I guess. Ooh, don't like that tone. That's a bit judgey. -Can I be honest? -Yes! Yes, be honest unless it's gonna upset me. And then lies will do fine. Angus, I'll be straight with you. I'm not a fan of the show. Well, I think I prefer the lies. It's a music show that's not really about the music. It's about zingers and insults. Yeah, well I'm with you mate. But the audience, you know, the public out there, they want the zingers. That's all they seem to be interested in. Not in chords and stuff. Your music is about making listeners happy, making them feel good. This show doesn't do that. You once told me there is no music without harmony. So, hang on. So instead of fighting against each other, you're a twit, I'm a twit, we should be working together in harmony? Yes, because you see that way-- Yeah, well, hang on, hang on, stop talking here. I'm thinking I'm having a moment of creative, what do they call it? Genius stuff. It's one of my moments. I'm having an epiphany moment. Yeah, I've got it right. Okay, with my purple pen here, I'll write a song that's celebrating harmony, not on a wishy washy way, but in a washy wishy way, which is the opposite wishy washy. And then Neon and I shall perform a song together with young musicians in the grand finale, which is French. And we should call the song... -Harmony? -No! Uh, wait. Yes. I was gonna call it "Blither-Blather." but harmony makes more sense, I suppose. Yeah, what a nice idea I've just had. Bodi, it's great that you're just listening in while I've had a great idea. Tune in for the finale, French. I will be spectacular and the other guys I suppose, maybe. Sounds great, Angus. That'll be... I'm in the zone. Harmony! Now to share my brilliance with Neon, Mr. Lightbulb. The two of us singing together? Yeah, along with the protégés as well. I mean, maybe. Kind of changes the vibe of the show. Yeah, well caring, sharing vibe. All about the oneness. Harmony. Ugh. Harmony is overrated. TV is about viewers. And right now the ratings are going through the roof. Not because of the music, but because they love it when you zing each other. That's what makes the show fun. Hmm. I think it will turn off the audience. You will lose fans. Nope. Pass. Hard pass. Really hard pass. We're just going to keep the show the way it is, Angus. So that's your decision, is it? Well, perhaps I'll just float the idea by the network executives and see what they gotta say. Some of those executives know a thing or two about stuff. -Hmm. -Mm-mm. I knew you would change your mind. Oh, what you got there? No, hang on. What are you doing? -Hey, come on, hurry up. -Okay! Bodi, I'm surprised to see you here. I thought you didn't like the show. I didn't, but Angus has something special planned for tonight and I don't wanna miss it. Angus? Uh... True to his unpredictable nature, Angus has left the show. -What? -Yep. He went totally rock and roll and quit. Ooh, this leaves his performer without a coach, which means they forfeit the finale. Neon, your team wins. Yeah! Neon, what do you have to say about your fellow musical coach and his decision to leave the show? I mean the only thing worse than being a loser is being a quitter. Zing! Well, that's gonna do it for this season of "Battle the Beat." But don't you worry. We have a fantastic brand new season right around the corner. It's gonna be bigger and better. Epic battles, more zings! Battling it out for an exclusive record contract will be guitar shredding impresario Axe Arrow. Competing against Axe will be the hottest girl band around, K-9. -Hey! -Hi, there! We're on TV. Hi Mom! Welcome. Of course, Neon will be one of the coaches, but we don't know who the other one will be yet. I'm kind of bummed. I was really looking forward to meeting Angus Scattergood. Yes, he is a legend. Right, girls? Like, literally, we've never heard of him. What? You don't know who Angus Scattergood is? He's a genius. A rock legend. He's the reason I first picked up a guitar. You know they can't hear you, right? This is crazy. They're contestants on a music show and they've never heard of Angus? Or his music. I have to do something about this. What can you do? I'm gonna take them up on their offer. I'll teach these kids who Angus Scattergood is and restore his legacy as a Rock God. I'm gonna be the next coach on "Battle the Beat." Where am I? Who am I? Hang on. That's a pleasant sound. I like that sound. Do you know who I am? I lost my memory. Hello? Mesdames and messieurs, hello. Uh, pardon me, are you sheep, 'cause you seem to have no leader and are traversing this mountainous region with no guidance? Yeah, we ain't formally organized or nothing. Ah! That's what I do! That's what I do. I'm a sheep leader. A sheep herder. A shepherd. I'm your leader. I will tend to your herd. Uh, yeah. I mean technically we're a flock. One man's flock is another man's herd. We're good with that. Right! Let's soldier on. And we'll move forwards. Okay, V formation. This sheep here, you take point. Just everyone move to the left. Oh, and move to the right. Right. Skip to the left and skip to the right and jump to the left and jump to the right and spin, spin, spin, and down. Move to the left and then move to the right and skip to the left and skip to the right. Now jump to the left and jump to the right and you spin all around and you-- Whoa! -Hmm? -Hmm. Welcome to the new season of "Battle the Beat". Back with us again as our resident musical coach and reigning champion, Neon Lyte! Thank you, thank you. Please, sit down, sit down. The King of Zing is in the house! Sit down, sit down. And replacing Angus Scattergood from the band True Blue, is a multi-platinum recording artist that sold out arenas worldwide. Ladies and gentlemen, Rock Sensation Bodi! Bodi, are you ready to mix it up with Neon? I'm more excited about getting together with Axe and sharing with him what I know about rock and roll. That sounds wonderful except for one small detail. What's that? You're not going to be coaching Axe. -Huh? -That's right. Neon will be coaching Axe and you will be coaching the all girl group, K-9! What? I can't coach those girls. Sure you can. They're little pop star wannabes. They don't know anything about rock and roll. So teach them. That's what being a coach is all about, right? I guess so. Hey, I know. The show still has access to Angus's mansion. Why don't you set up shop there? What better way to introduce 'em to the world of rock and roll than in the legends lair? -That's a good idea. -It's settled. Now if you'll excuse me, I gotta take my head off. Huh? Oh, that's a show biz expression. I guess I've got a lot to learn about all this. You'll catch on. Unbelievable. A half hour late for their first rehearsal. Finally. Whoa, this crib is lit! Okay, girls, let's get... I am so crushing on this closet space. These digs are straight up amazing. Look at this studio. Me and my squad are gonna lay down some sic tracks. Hashtag killing it! Look at that screen! It's epic. I have to play my game like right now! Does anyone know the Wi-Fi password? This is unbelievable! Um, hello? Girls? Can you stop running and shouting? Oh my gosh! Huh? Whoa, dude. Why so salty? I was trying to get your attention. So, you do that by busting out our ear drums. Hashtag random. Yeah. You totally killed the vibe. What? No, I just... Look, you don't come into a stranger's house and start running all over the place. Do you know whose house this is? Yeah. Andy Smatherwood. No. Smattergood. I mean Angus Scattergood. Eh, I like the other name better. Yeah. I just posted I'm at Andy Snatterwood's house and I already have over 30,000 likes. Huh? Make that 30,000 and two. Could you guys handle your own luggage? -This is too much for Ozzie. -Sure. But we're gonna need some help with our other bags. What other bags? Why did you pack so much? Well, we have all the outfits we perform in, plus lighting. You brought your own stage lights? Do you spell your name with an I or a Y? I. Why? No, seriously, which is it? I or Y? No, why do you need to know? I'm tagging you in a post. -Which platform do you like? -Platform? Look. They came down the mountain doing this and haven't stopped. Hmm. And they wanna sing "Glitter Rainbow." That's not even real music. Bodi, sweetie darling, don't complain to me. You have to use the video diary booth. What is that? It's a crucial part of the show where you can sound off about anyone or anything. Viewers love it. Gets a lot of zings too. Okay. I'm doing this because of "Glitter Rainbow" that new song the girls wanna sing. It's not good. It's not even music. It took no talent to write and less talent to sing. I mean, if that's the kind of music they wanna do, I don't know if I can continue to do the show. That's how much I don't like that song. This doesn't seem right. ♪ Let's go ♪ Huh? Hey, Bodi. Well, what do you think? That was different. Since you're doing the TV show and we have some time off, I decided to explore different musical horizons. What do you call that? Zydeco Viking medal. Maybe we play it on our next True Blue tour. Check this out, Bodi. I call it aqua crunk ambient trance music. That's definitely not rock and roll. No, it's music they play in the elevators. And if you're lucky, the dentist office. Bodi, what are you doing here? Aren't you supposed to be coaching your performers? I think they're uncoachable. That's what my soccer coach said about me. And my track coach and my toe wrestling coach. What? It's a thing. What seems to be the problem, Bodi? For one, they don't understand rock and roll. What kind of music are they into? "Glitter Rainbow", but I'd hardly call that music. Oh, and they like bubbles too. Lots of bubbles. Bodi, you have to be patient and open-minded. Remember, rock and roll isn't the only kind of music. But it is the best kind of music. Only the girls don't know that because they've only heard it. They've never actually played rock and roll. Hey, that's it. If they play it, they'll truly get connected to the heart of rock and roll. Does rock and roll have a spleen too? 'Cause that would be very important for preventing infections. Or would that be the gallbladder of rock and roll? What do you think, Darma? Well, it's not exactly what I meant. I know. It's better. I can't wait to tell the girls they're gonna be performing an Angus Scattergood song live on TV. Ladies, it's time to rehearse. We've been practicing. It doesn't matter. I'm so stoked. I found the perfect song for you. Oh, 'cause we have a song we'd like to sing. Really? It wouldn't happen to be "Barking Moon" by Angus Scattergood, would it? Who's Angus? He means Andy. -Oh. -No, no, no. It's "Sugar, Sugar, Boom, Boom" by Neon. It's straight fire! Okay, I don't know what that means, but Neon is the competition. You're singing "Barking Moon." But we don't like that kind of music. You don't like it because you've only heard it. Yeah, duh. But once you play, actually play the music, you will totally fall in love with it. Huh? You're kidding me, right? Yeah, we can't play like that. Not yet. You just have to practice. Why can't we just do what we did on our audition tape? You want to win the recording contract, don't you? Yeah. Well, listen. I'm the coach. Trust me, with my band, True Blue, I filled arenas and sold a lot of music. This is the song that will get you votes. Hmm. Let's rock and roll! The beat is a little off. Let's try it again. ♪ Now who's the big dog ♪ ♪ Who's bigger than you ♪ Try it again. ♪ Me and my big bloodhounds ♪ ♪ Who likes to shout at the moon ♪ Again. Again. ♪ Barking moon... ♪ ♪ Yeah! ♪ ♪ ...Going out to you ♪ ♪ Barking moon... ♪ ♪ Yeah! ♪ Again. Yes, that's better. You're starting to get it. Wow, we've been up all night? Now that's rock and roll. I need sleep. Me too. Me three. -Me four. -Let's turn in. Hello? Bodi, where are you? We're at the mansion. Why? We have a show today. Oh, you and the girls are supposed to be here for tech rehearsal. What? No, the girls can't perform today. They're not ready. Bodi, this isn't rock and roll park where you perform when you feel like it. This is showbiz. We have a schedule to keep. Get over here. There must be someone who knows who I am. Is there? Hang on. No sound. This is music to my ears. I feel like I belong. Hey! Are you the mechanic? Mechanic? Is that what it's called? Yes. Yes, I am. That was Axe from Team Neon. A truly explosive performance. Now let's hear K-9 from Team Bodi as they perform a cover of the classic Angus Scattergood hit "Barking Moon." ♪ I can howl at the moon ♪ ♪ Louder than a wolf in the night ♪ ♪ I just keep barking like a dog ♪ Ooh. ♪ It's a big dog bite ♪ Um... ♪ Barking moon ♪ ♪ I'm coming after you ♪ ♪ Barking moon ♪ ♪ I'm coming after you ♪ Okay, interesting start for both acts. Let's hear from the coaches. -Neon? -What can I say about Axe? He look good, he sounded good. Dude is the whole package. Stellar performance. Bodi, what did you think about Axe? He was great. Yeah! I wish you were on my team. Did I say that out loud? Wow. I know, right? Bodi's nose looks really big on TV. No, I meant wow, I don't think Bodi knows how this show works. Neon, any comments about K-9? Hey, you know I come with the truth and the truth is I was bored, the audience was bored. Heck, their music was so boring even their drummer fell asleep. Zing! Bodi, don't just sit there. What do you have to say? Um, well, you know, I have to agree. It could have been better. Their rendition of "Barking Moon" was more like "Barking Doom." Zing! Bodi just zinged his own group! Oh, no he didn't. Oh, yes he did. No that wasn't a zing. I was just pointing out that-- How terrible they were. Now it's time for my favorite part of "Battle the Beat". Viewers, log into your smart devices and vote now. Everyone's voting for Bodi's group, right? Absolutely. You bet! So, now that we're all getting along, we're supposed to follow his orders like sheep? We're wolves. It's time we started showing our teeth again. Okay, let's see how the viewers voted. With all the votes in, 98% went to... Team Neon! Leaving only 2% For team Bodi. That gives Axe a whopping 98% to two lead. However, it's still early in the competition, but that's a big lead to overcome for Bodi and K-9. It could have been worse. How? All three of them could have fallen asleep. If you ask me, Bodi's gone soft. He's like a marshmallow. I kind of agree with the wolf. He let Neon walk all over him. He's gotta stand up for himself and fight back. Are you saying my son is weak? Well he sure didn't look like a mastiff. He was more like one of those little shaky dogs that lives in a purse. Ooh, zing! "Shaky dog?" It's all happening just the way you thought it would, Hazel. Perfect. You get those wolves on board and I'll continue to take care of the rest. Whether you zing or not, not my boy! There you are. You guys disappeared after the show. We were venting in the diary booth. Really? Who are you guys griping about? Who do you think? You. Me? Why? You threw us under the bus. Neon was crushing us and you piled on. What was I supposed to say? Um, maybe that we did a good job? It's a competition. You want us to win, don't you? Yes, of course. -Then you have to up your game. -How? When Neon gives you a verbal jab, you punch him right back. Pow! -You want me to hit him? -No. If he gives you an insult, you zing one back. So, if he says something snarky about our singing, you say "Neon, I know someday you'll go far. And when you do, I hope you stay there." That's funny. A little mean spirited, but funny. It just seems like it would be a better show if we were nice to each other and got along. Yeah, no. -Who would wanna watch that? -I would. Yeah, but you're boring. No, I'm not. I'm a rock star. -Not when you talk. -The least you can do is toss a couple of zingers Neon's way. I don't know. It's not really my style, but for you girls, I'll try. You made us sing that lame song and embarrass ourselves on live TV. We have to do a song that's in sync with our groove. "Sugar, Sugar, Boom, Boom." -Yes! -Fine. Let's hear it. - Hello? - Hello? Oh yes. Mrs. Barstool. Yes, I'm working on your car right now. It should be done at three o'clock. Better make that four o'clock. 4:30. Quarter five. What? You just came in to change the oil. I'm not a mechanic! Bye. That song was amazing. ♪ Sugar, sugar, boom, boom ♪ ♪ Boom, boom ♪ ♪ This beat's something sweet ♪ ♪ Sugar, sugar, boom, boom ♪ ♪ Boom, boom ♪ ♪ Sugar, sugar, sugar, boom ♪ Okay. That'll work for now. But we have to think ahead to the finale where the points are tripled. We can sing "Snap It Hot." Everybody loves that song. Or, or, or "Love Storm." That was number one for weeks. No, if you really wanna blow the audience away, you can't do somebody else's song. But we don't have our own song. Hmm. So write one. Hmm. What in your past caused you to embrace music? Where we grew up, the other kids teased us. -A lot. -We were different. So they made fun of us. And how did that make you feel? Sad. Like we couldn't be ourselves. And that's why we started playing music. It made us feel good. Like we belong to something. That's what you need to write about. You need to do it for yourselves and for all those kids out there who don't fit in. But won't it seem like we're whining about our problems? No. With music you have the power to heal the divide and bring everyone together. You really think we can do all that? I believe in your talents. The question is, do you? -Let's do it! -Yeah! Hey! Watch where you're going. Me? What do you think, you own the street? Yeah, keep rolling your eyes. Maybe you'll find a brain back there. Hang on. That sounds familiar. Hey! Ah! Shoosh, shoosh, shoosh, shoosh. Shoosh, shoosh. That's it.

Neon? Once again, my boy Axe nailed it. Yeah. I felt like his guitar was singing to me. Just a stellar performance. What are your thoughts on K-9? Well, nobody in the band fell asleep, so that was good. Zing! Bodi, what do you have to say to that? I thought it was a really solid performance. Are you sure about that? They sounded a little pitchy to me. Well, yeah, they were a little off key here and there. So you admit it was a flawed performance? -Yes. -Oh, no. -Well, what? -Aye, Chihuahua. Come on, Bodi! Fight back! Zing him again, Neon. What part of their performance was worse? The dancing that looked like they were waiting to use the bathroom or the singing that sounded like they were chipmunks sucking on helium? Zing! Why is he just sitting there? Perhaps he had a recent accident that rendered his legs useless. No, I mean, why isn't he saying anything? Maybe the same accident where he hurt his legs he also damaged his vocal chords. He wasn't in an accident. Oh. Well that's good news 'cause there was a rumor floating around that he was. Of course I can't blame the girls. With you as their coach, it's like the tone deaf leading the tone deaf. Zing! Neon, you're on fire! I know, I know. They may have to issue an excessive heat warning. Yeah, Neon. You're hot stuff all right. And someday I know you're gonna go far. And when you do, please stay there. Ooh, Bodi with a little half zinger. Yeah, keep rolling your eyes, Neon. Maybe you'll find a brain back there. Now that was a full fledged zinger. That's my boy. Chihuahua, huh? Look, man, no need for personal attacks. I'm just pointing out that clearly Axe had the better performance today. Yeah. And I would love to agree with you, Neon, but then we would both be wrong. Zinged! All right, all right. You got a couple of shots in. Don't start thinking you're all that now. I don't know. Awesome ends with me and untalented begins with you. Zing! Okay. You know what? Well, you just need to you, uh... -You just, uh... -To what? Sorry, Neon. I didn't mean to push all your buttons. I was just looking for the mute. Zing! Lezah, I should have bought a shovel with me. -Why is that? -Because I'm about to bury Neon. Zing! Look at Bodi! We may have a new King of Zing! Let's see how the audience voted. Drifty, drifty, drifty, drifty. Ah. Drifty, drifty, drifty. Well, at least some of my wool is clean. Shush, shush, shush. Drifty, drifty, drifty. Look at that! All right. All clean down here. Ta-shush, ta-shush. You were amazing! You shut Neon down! You are a baller. Bodi got game! So no diary booth today, huh? Nope. Bodi, you finally stepped it up. I like the new you and this is just the beginning. Starting tomorrow we're gonna launch a whole new ad campaign centered around you. -Me? -That's right, Bodi. You are the new you face of the show. The King of Zing. Neon, if you ran like your mouth, you'd be in good shape. You're like school in July. No class. Bodi! Neon says he's gonna dethrone the king of Zing. You can tell Neon I think he sounds better with his mouth closed. Huh? -Hmm. -Yes. Next time, bring a ladder with you because that's the only way you'll get to my level. And that's why they call Bodi-- The King of Zing! Bodi, Bodi, Bodi, Bodi, -Bodi, Bodi! -Bodi! Bodi! We're playing here. Just gimme two seconds. How does this sound? We were so disconnected. Totally rejected. We were living on our own still together, -but alone. -Mia, that is fire. Yeah, those lyrics are savage. It's Lezah. I gotta take this. Bodi. Where are you going? I gotta do this podcast. Then I have a meeting with a publisher. They want me to write a book. We thought you were gonna help us with our song. The finale is tonight. I know, I will. Just gimme a few hours. I know we're, like, killing it on the show now, but something doesn't feel right. What am I? What do I do? I'm just wondering around not knowing. I don't know... know nothing. Do I sell shoes? Doubtful. Don't like feet. High-rise window cleaner. Scared of heights. Bee keeper. No, they'd bite you. With teeth as big as dogs. I don't know! No one knows! If only there was a sign. Oh. Hang on. Like seriously, how can I beat a robot? Bodi's still on the other side of town. How do you know that? Is he posting? No, I put a tracker app on his phone so we know where he is 'cause he's like always gone now. Yeah. How are we gonna finish this song without him? Wait, I have an idea. Come with me. Whoa! Do you think Angus played all of these? I don't know, but I want to. Wait. It says choose wisely. Only one guitar will work. Ugh. There are literally a million guitars in here. -It would take forever to-- -Found it! -What? Are you sure? -Yep. -Which one? -That one. The one with the bubbles on it. Hello? -Whoa! -Congratulations. You have chosen the bubble guitar, which is my favorite guitar 'cause I really like bubbles, you see. I like bath bubbles. I like bubble gum. I like blowing bubbles with the bubble gum in a bubble bath sometimes, you know, 'cause I'm very crazy and rock and roll. Because you chose this bubble guitar, I'm gonna share with you my wisdom about all things guitar and bubbly. Now I like other instruments, like, uh, you know, the cowbell and the glockenspiel and the sliding monkey. But the bubble guitar is really quite special. It is the unicorn of instruments because it is so magical. "Well, how is so magical?" You ask. Well, look at this. This is the whammy bar. With this I can make all these other interesting sounds as well. That sounds like an elephant. That's a motorbike. That's a six speed blender. This, listen to this one. This is the spectral glide. Otherwise known as the "wah" effect. And this one is a talky-box. It's always loud and the-- It's like auto tune. Only better. Now just imagine what you could create with the bubble guitar. So this is what Bodi was talking about. We were recording, right? Uh... Ozzie, you're the man! Or the robot. Or whatever. I'll upload the song and send it to Bodi. He's gonna love it. Our special tonight is bubble and squeak dumplings. You see, bubble and squeak, it's got bubbles in it and squeaky things which are dead now so they don't squeak so much. Here we go. So first of all, we add a little bit of this. Put that into, pinch of salt for flavor, a bit of pepper. This is Bok Choy. That's a vegetable that's just given up. And put all that, bit of this, bit of... Oh, what's that's? The spices. It's oregano. That's called dill. That's Kevin. Okay. Oh, sorry mate. Huh? Voila! There we go. Voila, that is your meal. Eat it. That's strong. Just make sure you bring your A game tonight because it's the finals. Yeah, I will. But you gotta do something about Bodi. Don't worry. I hired a guy. You hired someone to take him out? What? Nah, nah. I hired a joke writer to come up with zingers for me. ♪ So let's come together ♪ Whoa. Is that an original? I've never heard it before. Huh. That is straight up fire. ♪ Together ♪ Did they write this? I think so. It's all about positive energy and togetherness and unity. No, no, no, no. They are not doing a song like that on my show. It'll ruin everything I've created. Hey, hey, you can't stop them from doing their own song. Oh, you'd be surprised what I'm capable of. Huh? Have you seen Bodi? He was here a while ago, but he left. What's up? We were wondering what he thought of our new song. You're not planning on singing that song tonight, are you? Yes. Why? Don't you like it? Oh, I love it. It's just that... Well... What? I'm not so sure Bodi liked it. Did he say something? Yes. In the diary booth. Huh? I hesitate to show you this, but... That new song the girls wanna sing, it's not good. It's not even music. It took no talent to write and less talent to sing. I mean, if that's the kind of music they wanna do, I don't know if I can continue to do the show. That's how much I don't like that song. I'm sorry you had to see that, but you really should know the truth. Okay, let's take five, all right? Ta-da. What do you think? You look like that dude that sells mattresses on late night TV. I'm the King of Zing. What does that have to do with music? Nothing. But it's the hook for the show. Which is kind of not cool because it's all about you being nasty and stuff. Yeah, but it's all in good fun. I don't know. What you do on TV affects others. Is this how you want everyone to act? Oh, the girls sent me their new song, ♪ Dare to be different ♪ ♪ Unique and comforted ♪ ♪ That's just me and you ♪ ♪ So let's come together ♪ ♪ So let's come together ♪ Togetherness and unity. Now that is how I would like people to act. Well, rock onto that. Bodi, they're ready for you. I'm done with zing. It's time to sing. Eh, Bodi, Bodi? Hear ye, hear ye. Is anyone interested in buying a mattress? Hey girls, I loved your new song. We need to rehearse it before the show. Huh? Bodi, we saw your video diary. You took some savage shots at us. What? We understand if you don't like our song, but your zinging is out of control. We thought you were our friend, but you hurt us. It was just like being little kids all over again. You once said that music would bring us together. But if all you're gonna do is tear us apart, we can't be part of the show. We're going back home, back home. What is going on? Lezah? Huh? Angus is the only one I know who writes music with a purple pen. Angus, this is amazing. Why didn't you play this on the show? That new song the girls wanna sing, it's not good. It's not even music. It took no talent to write and-- Oh no! Mia, Lucy, Tess! Um. I wasn't talking about your song in the video! What is Bodi trying to say? Well, I... It doesn't matter. I love your song! Yeah right. Oh. Instead of fighting against each other, we should be working together in harmony. Mia, Lucy, Tess. I'm sorry. I've lost my way and forgot what this show is all about. It's not about zingers. It's about music. Music isn't meant to divide us. It's supposed to bring us together. And thanks for reminding me of that with your beautiful song. I am so proud of you. And if you can find it in your heart to forgive me, I would be honored to sing it with you together as one in harmony. What should we do? Hey, what's going on? Why did you post my video diary? Because K-9 can't sing that song tonight. -Why not? -A song about togetherness? Where's the conflict? Where's the drama? Without it, we don't have a show. You could have a show. It just wouldn't be all negative. The show has to be negative. That's what gets viewers riled up. Why do you want everybody agitated? Because then we can go back to the old ways. Hmm. I know that voice. You sound like-- Hazel? Yeah, but... I guess you never figured out that Hazel spelled backwards is Lezah. Um. Are you okay? Yes! This mask is, uh, tricky. Could you gimme a hand? What? You're Hazel? Yes! I'm a sheep in wolves clothing. What is it with you guys? First it was wolves pretending to be sheep and now it's sheep becoming wolves? Very confusing. It's really quite simple, Bodi. I liked it much better when the wolves were after the sheep and the sheep had to fight back. Those days are over. I'm bringing them back. And this show is helping. I'm sorry, Hazel, but I can't let you continue this. The world needs to hear K-9's song. We need unity, not division. You sound just like Scattergood. That's why I had to do away with him. What? Look, I don't know what you did with Angus, but you are telling me where he is and we are shutting this show down. No! No? No. Okay, maybe you've been dressing up as a wolf too long, but you're a sheep and I'm a mastiff. Uh-huh and he's a wolf. What? Really? A frying pan. Eh, it worked, didn't it? Everything okay between you and Larry? I thought you two were friends. I don't know what's gotten into him. Lately he's been getting all wolfy. Really? He's not the only one. Have you noticed how they always travel in groups now? Pack mentality. The other night I heard several of them howling and it wasn't even a full moon. It was waxing crescent. Nope. It was a waning gibbous moon. I think you're getting poor reception with those antlers. It was waxing crescent. They're horns. And I know my lunar faces. It was waning gibbous, you dingle head. Does it really matter? The point is the wolves may be returning to their old ways. So we better keep an eye on them. Bodi, we're back! Huh? Bodi! Bodi, where are you? Bodi! Where is he? Bodi! I called again. He's still not answering. Hmm. Wait, I know! I'll use the app to find him. What is he doing on the other side of town -in a warehouse? -Huh? What you're doing isn't right. I know, but it is fun and I like working with Hazel. But if you succeed, you can't be friends. What are you trying to say? That wolves attack sheep and sheep run. Hard to maintain a solid friendship with all that going on. You don't know. We might be able to work out some kind of arrangements. Her and I can... Hey, I know what you're trying to do and it's not gonna work. You're not getting outta here. Huh? What is that? I think it's a helicopter. Inside here? -Do you know how to drive this? -Don't worry. I play racing games all the time. -Huh? -Well, I see the joystick, but where's the star button on this thing? Huh? Huh? Whoa! A whale in here? How is that possible? Welcome to the season finale of "Battle the Beat." I have some startling news to reveal. Did she say startling news? Yes, now quiet down so we can hear. Button the lips, sheepy, or I'll make a wool coat of ya. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Why don't you both cork it? Huh? Shh, shh, shh! Huh? I'll reveal the big news right after this commercial break. Um, guys, a little help? Getting nauseous. Voila. Dad, look! Someone's on the roof! Huh? Thanks. Huh? Game over. We're never gonna make it in time. May I? Welcome back. You may have noticed that Neon and Axe are here but where's Bodi and K-9? Well, much like Angus Scattergood, they could not handle the competition and left the show. Quitters! Congratulations to Axe and his coach, Neon. You are our new champions of "Battle the Beat." And I'll take my scepter back. Not so fast! K-9 isn't quitting anything.
