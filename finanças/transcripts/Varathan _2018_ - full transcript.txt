George, I'm really confident about this project. We can finish it in two months' time. This is its initial design. Have your coffee, pal. Abin, actually we can't continue with this project. Our company is going through its worst phase. I don't think our company will get such a big project in the near future. Above all, you're really talented and you've years of experience working in Dubai. Actually you're way too qualified and talented for us to afford you any more. That's the truth. Do you want to say something? - No.. Absolutely no. I think this is the right time. You've enough contacts in this city, right? I'm really tired and I want to leave this job. Even I want a break. There is a reason. Priya is pregnant. Really? That's good news. Congratulations, pal! So, things are working out. - Yes. I guess.. It was a pleasure. Anyway, George, you've been wonderful. You needn't hurry. Finish your coffee, pal. No, I'll just meet everyone. I'll inform all of them. And have a smoke.. Sorry about this. No.. Absolutely no. Thank you, George. It's been a pleasure. - Same here. Let me walk you out. - Yes. Can I take this? My phone.. - Yes. 'Smoking is injurious to health.' Hello. - 'Abin.' - Yes. 'Have you started from the office?' No, we had a board meeting today morning. 'Okay, I'll go along with Shantha.' 'Call me when you leave the office.' Okay. Why did you bring a gift? How was the presentation? Well, that didn't work out. The client backed off at the last moment. What happened then? The board is really confused as the company doesn't have any new projects. I mean, about my job. Did you buy this stuff to break the news to me? No. I bought it on a whim. I'm fine, dear. I'll be with you hereafter. You need rest at this stage. Abin. I met the doctor along with Shantha. They couldn't hear the heartbeat during the scan. They said, 'There is no hope.' Why didn't you inform me? You were in the office handling your presentation. I didn't want to make you upset. Are you all right? It was not planned anyway. It happened accidentally. Maybe, it's not the right time. We at least understood that we can become parents. Abin, get up. Let's eat out. Do you really want to go out? Abin, don't be so boring. I'll get ready soon. Do you remember our first drive? It was to Mamzar, right? With the IBM gang. - Yes. I miss that. I really miss those days, Abin. "You are the synonym of love." "You're the truth that I'm looking for." "You're a budding flower which would slowly blossom in me." "I saw her in the morning twilight." "She was as beautiful as the moonlight." "I heard your voice during a hot summer" "and it comforted me.." "Oh, love! I'm preparing myself" "to be yours." "I'm trying to find you" "as I want to be a part of your life." "I waited for so long.." "I waited.." "To see my reflection in you." "You're the synonym of love." "You're the truth that I'm looking for." "You're a budding flower which would slowly blossom in me." "You're as beautiful as a poem." "You're the fire of my life." "You're the song which I desperately want to sing." Thank you. I called up my mom soon after I left the hospital. Did you divulge it to her? No, I just called her up to hear her voice. Good. Had she got to know about it, she would've panicked. Abin, shall we leave this city for a while? What happened? I'm really tired of this place. The same feeling that I'd when I went to school on Mondays. You never studied in a boarding school, right? Every day was like Monday for me. That's not it, Abin. Why are we staying here needlessly paying a huge rent? I could meet my mom and my sister if we're in our home town. You could also go to Bangalore and spend some time with your brother. What about your job? Not an issue. I can work from home as I'd applied for it because of my pregnancy. I just need a laptop and a Wi-Fi connection. That's one of the few advantages of working in this field. Isn't it better to launch your start-up at our home town? You know about start-ups, right? There is very less chance that it will succeed. It's okay, Abin. Take your time. It's your long-time dream, right? You haven't seen dad's plantation at Eighteenth Mile, right? You'll love it. It will also be a change for us. Let's go and stay there. It would be better than eating the organic food of this city. It's a good idea. Won't you miss Dubai? We'll come back if we miss this place. Really? Do you want to smoke yourself to death or what? 'Attention, please.' 'Venus Airlines Flight IC 367..' - 'VARATHAN' '...from Dubai to Kochi is ready for take-off.' 'On behalf of the captain' 'and rest of the crew, we welcome you on-board.' 'If you need anything' 'please let us know.' 'Until then sit back, relax' 'and enjoy this flight.' 'Sit back, relax' 'and enjoy this flight.' 'Sit back, relax and enjoy this flight.' 'Attention, please.' 'Attention, please.' 'Sit back, relax' 'and enjoy this flight.' Mister, is there no rain? Not really. Dear, why don't you stay here for a few days before leaving? No way. Why? - Mom, we'll be here for a while. We'll visit you next weekend. Hey! Set the table instead of eating all the 'Papads'. Kurian hasn't visited you guys for a long time, right? He was here just a few days ago. He has to retire after one and a half years. The service can be extended, right? What's the point in extending the service? Getting a job after retiring from the Air Force at the age of 48 is very difficult. Kurian will surely get a job. As if you've a job to offer him. Even youngsters are struggling to get a job. - No. Abin, pass me that curry. Government servants get pension after retirement. - Mom. What is your plan, Abin? - Mom. I'm planning to launch a start-up. - Mom. What is that? Private or government sector? What kind of a question is that, Mom? I'll bring the glasses. Abin, eat. Did mother-in-law go to bed? - Yes. Mom is becoming more practical with age. She struggled a lot to bring us up after my dad's demise. Don't take that seriously. It's all right, dear. She will be concerned about her daughters' life. Let's leave early morning. Maria has let us borrow her car. Come here on weekends. - Yes.. Have you saved Mr. Benny's contact number? - Yes. I've told him to get you the internet and the gas connections. Abin, he is a little annoying, but be in good terms with him. He is useful. - Shut up. He is an innocent guy. You can trust him. But he is slightly into politics. That's all. He has all the bad qualities that come with it. Since you guys will be there, keep an eye on everything. Okay, Mother-in-law. See you. - Bye. - Maria. - See you. Inform Kunjumol once she is awake. I'll surely visit you next week. Go. The 'Appam' and stew she prepared was delicious. Really? You should've told this to mom instead of telling me. She might have understood. I ate a lot. But you could've told her. Why did you get inside the car so soon? You could've held her hand and said goodbye. I am not good at following such etiquettes. Okay. I know that. Leave my hand. Let me drive. I won't. Sir, can you please drop him at Eighteenth Mile? He has an examination. There is no bus service at this time. Can you please drop him at the school? Yes.. Get in.. Okay. Which exam are you taking today? Mathematics. Sir, can you please stop the car? Why? - I want to get down here. What time is your exam? - Mathematics. You asked about the subject, right? - Yes, it's mathematics! Okay, sir. Kids of this generation are clear about everything. Mathematics. Sir, two cups of tea. Do you want cut cakes? One is enough. We'll share it. Sir, one cut cake. Where are you heading to, sir? - Are you going to the resort? No. To a nearby place. Palathingal. I see. DFO Paul's place. You work in the Air Force, right? - No, I work in Dubai. Priya. You didn't recognise me, right? Your mother and sister still live in Kochi, right? Yes.. Hello. - Yes. - Rs. 27. Take Rs. 30. Okay. Sir, the change.. - That's okay.. Some people are keen on ruining our culture. I wish I was born in this age. 'Gents' Beauty Parlour.' Greetings, sir. Hi, Ms. Priya. Sir, please get off. Let me park the car. It's okay. Well, it's something else. It's an old water service setup. The car will fall into that drain if not parked correctly. Shall I try? Okay. It seems he is really adventurous. Was your journey fine? - It was good. How is your mother? - She is fine. Do you remember that vehicle? Of course. Dad used to drop me at school on it. It works fine even now. It's perfect for short trips. Really? - Those two. Sir, I'm Benny. - Abin. Sir, let me carry it. - No. It's okay.. Murugan, take all the luggage. - What? Keep that inside. - It's okay. Keep it there. Sir, this is Murugan. Murugan is versatile. Where are you from? A place near Theni. - Okay. Take it. Abin, is the internet connection working? It will surely work. He is good at this. I'm able to connect and its speed is good. So, shall we leave? Sir, let us take your leave. - Okay. - Okay, see you tomorrow. Okay. - Mr. Benny don't you drink? Sir, I'm fasting. I don't drink at this time of the year. Sorry.. I forgot that. Sir, please give it as it's the first thing that you've offered me. I can drink it once the fast ends. Right, ma'am? 'Alcohol consumption is injurious to health.' Okay. - Okay. - Bye. Bye, sir. - Okay. See you tomorrow. Abin, bring the suitcases as well. - Okay. My grandpa bought this property from this man. This is my grandpa. Mr. Varghese Paul. He was an advisor of the British magistrate of this town. This is my father-in-law, right? Mr. Paul was really handsome! Right? Abin. You look great! These are night-vision goggles. That's my grandpa's. - Okay. Hero pen. It's exactly like a villain's den from an 80s movie! Cockroach.. Hey.. Don't kill it.. Why did you kill it? Then? Should I've made it my pet or what? You shouldn't have killed it. It would've lived somewhere. I don't want it to live in my house. This is my dad's biogas set-up. Nice. Mr. Paul was some man! Yes, but this set-up was a flop. Oh, God! It's so noisy. It's the sound of male crickets. Who said so? - My dad used to say that. Oh! Why do they make this sound? To attract female crickets. Really? They will never get attracted. 'Bible.' Abin. Abin. Abin. Abin. Abin. - Good morning. Didn't you sleep? - I woke up early. It has been so long since we sat together like this. We've enough time to do it now. My mom and dad used to drink coffee here. Is it? Abin. What are you thinking? I was thinking that I don't have many nostalgic experiences to share. What do you call it? Reminiscence. - Oh, God! It's so tough to pronounce. How can we feel it then! "We're turning into new seasons" "which add" "new dimensions to dreams." "The gentle breeze which is embraced" "by the mountain is blending with our tune." "Love is falling on us like dew drops." "The eyes are sparkling." I studied from eighth grade to twelfth grade in this school. Really? - Yes. We shifted to Kochi after dad's demise. Good morning, Sister? - Where is your classroom? Well.. It's there. This is a new block. You're Priya Paul, right? - Yes.. How are you, dear? I'm fine. This is Abin. How are you, Sister? - I'm fine. She has read all the books in this library. What you said is right. She has a great memory. She said your name after just one glance. It's not that she remembers everyone. She remembers me as I was her favourite student. Oh! Okay. - Really. Okay. Really. - I believe you. Give it to me. Shall I get two cut cakes for you? No. It seems you could start a fans' association here! Abin, look at that guy. He ogles women. It's difficult to even walk close to him. My sister and I used to refer to him as 'Chameleon'. Why? - He used to make us feel really uncomfortable. Hey. She is Lilly's youngest daughter. Maria's younger sister. She is more gorgeous than her mother and sister. He is really lucky. Even when my parents' moved here, he used to sit there like this. She is Maria's sister. Priya Paul. Class 12 B. Are you tired? - A bit. Take rest for a while. - Okay. Mr. Benny is already here. Mr. Benny. Good morning. - Good morning.. Where did you guys go? - For a walk. I thought of selling all the pepper we have. I see. How much is its selling price? - Nothing substantial. The business is dull. No one really wants it. After paying the labourers, we won't have anything left. Our effort goes in vain. Murugan, bring everything that's kept there. - Yes. They.. I told them to supply a bottle of milk twice a day. It's good quality milk, sir. They have good quality cows. They live nearby. They are poor people. Did you recognise them? - Was it for them? How was your examination? He always says that it was average. Give the bottle to him. What's your name? - Preman. Preman. Shall we leave, sir? Sir. How do you know them? Mr. Benny, even we know a few people of this village. What do you want, coffee or tea? Tea. You're lucky, Ms. Priya. He is really caring. How are your wife and kids? Yes. Raechel's examinations are going on. So, my wife and my daughter are always in the church. I see. Parunthumpara is not like how it was before. It got renovated. Tiles were laid. The place is worth watching. Visit the place someday with Mr. Abin. You made the tea so quickly. Here you go. Shall I also go sell the pepper? You guys have come here to take rest. Why do you want to do it? That's okay, sir. It's good to know about all that. - That's right. Do one thing. Get ready quickly, sir. Shall I finish my tea first? - Sure. Sir, are you looking for a job here? I have to. I'll do that after a while. If you want a servant to do the household chores I'll inform Preman's mother. No, we can manage it. Sir, please pull over. - Okay. He has come. Did all the cement sacks arrive? Yes, we've unloaded it. - Is it? - Yes. I'll just go to the town and come back. - Okay. What building is that? The new information centre. No one can do anything wrong in this town once it's ready. We can keep an eye on everything from there. What could possibly happen here? You can't even begin to imagine. The other day, a guy took his wife to the hill and pushed her down the cliff. He murdered her. He then filed a complaint to the police that his wife is missing. The police searched the vicinity. They found nothing except a pig's skeleton. That's about it. What happened next? Isn't it obvious? He escaped by bribing the police. Strangers come here and commit such crimes. We're the ones who suffer. Don't you understand, sir? It's simple as that. I am getting a hang of things. 72 multiplied by 456 is equal to 30,080. We'd learned that 72 multiplied by 456 is equal to 32,832. Calculate once again. - 72 multiplied by 456 is equal to.. He is right. 32,832. How could you make a mistake while using a calculator? That's because of this cold and cosy weather. It doesn't work properly during winter, right? Mr. Benny, let's go. Isn't this the whole amount? I'll count. - Okay. He is our regular buyer. Is Mr. Benny here? Who are you? Jithin. Contractor Pappalli sent me here. Mr. Benny is not here. He has gone out. Contractor Pappalli has asked Mr. Benny to come there. I'll inform him. Do you want one? - No. Or else give me one. I'll give it to my friend. Foreign cigarettes are really expensive here. She might have fallen asleep. Priya. She'd have fallen asleep. - Maybe.. Priya. Sorry.. I was attending a client's call. Here is the money that we got by selling pepper. I needn't go to Kochi for giving this. Yes, you can give it to me. Shall I leave, sir? - Okay. Sir. - Yes. - Someone called Pappalli sent a guy to inform you that he wanted to meet you. He has taken our land on lease for agriculture. I'll meet him tomorrow. Okay, sir. Can I come with you? - Okay. Okay, see you tomorrow. Wow! Nice. Happy anniversary. Happy anniversary to us. Four years. So, one.. Two.. Let me arrange the rest. Three.. Four.. I had called up Thomas. I explained to him the basic plan of my start-up. - Really? What did he say? - He is a little busy. He said that we could discuss once he is free. It's okay to wait for a good designer like him. Abin, take enough time to do it. Everything else is fine. Thank you. Hold this. Do you know which couple lived together for the most number of years? Who are they? - Shoshama Thomas and Philipose Thomas. Are they from Kerala? - Yes. They were from Kottayam. Shoshama was 12 and Philipose was 13 years old when they got married. They lived together for 90 years. Let's hit a century then. - Sure. To Shoshama. - And Philipose. And to our happiness. - Happiness. Blow it. - Together. Yes. One.. Two.. Three. Abin, someone is standing there. What? - Someone is standing there. There is no one here. I saw someone near the window. It must have been a dream. Come, let's sleep. Come. 'Wear helmets while riding motorcycles.' Sir the man who is sitting on the wall and drinking is Contractor Kuriachan's brother-in-law, Baby. He is in the army and he is a heavy drinker. He is on leave. The other guy is Kuriachan's second brother, Peter. He is single. Did you notice that bodybuilder? He is the youngest. His name is Kunjimon. He is short-tempered and reckless. That man who is wearing eyeglasses is the contractor's father. They shifted to this place during his dad's time. I see. - Did you notice that guy standing near the jeep wearing trousers? He is the contractor's son, Johnny. The guy who is standing next to him is Jithin. He sticks around here. He is a nobody. Don't be afraid. Come this way, sir. He is the contractor.. He took all the land good for farming, in this village, on lease. Don't be afraid.. Come. It won't hurt you. This is Mr. Paul's youngest daughter's husband. Abin. - Abin. Did the dog scare you? - Well.. He got a bit terrified. - I was wondering who the stranger accompanying Benny was. If you're terrified of him now what would you do if he breaks the chain and runs at you? Dear, bring that packet inside my table's drawer. Okay, Dad. Who is that? It's me, sir. Benny from Parakudi. Hey! There are gorgeous women there. It's useless talking to you. You've never seen gorgeous women. You've only seen the ordinary women of this town. I'll manage with that, Brother-in-law. Whatever. Kunjimon, give us company. No. - Exercise well. Give that to him. You're in the tenth grade, right? - Yes. Sandra, right? Dad, I'm leaving. - Okay. Did your elder daughter return after completing her education? Jessy has gone to attend the pre-marriage course. What's the point in educating girls? Mom, I'm leaving. Shall we leave? - Carry on with your work. Okay. - Bye. - Okay. Who is that? - He is her husband. She looks gorgeous now. He is that military man's son. His name is Josy. He runs a textiles shop in the town. Did I scare you? When did you come? - Just a while ago. Sweets that were bought for Jessy's bride seeing ceremony. I had some already. Priya? Why do you do chores that you shouldn't? Give that to me. Come and watch me if you want to. He is in an awful situation, isn't he? Not really. He is happy. I'm bothered about Priya. Hope he is taking good care of her. It's obvious from his smile that he is good-for-nothing. You have started drinking so early in the day. Jithin, can't you do some work? Come, Sabu. I think the yams are ready for harvest. Whenever she smiles like this I remember our tour to Ooty from school. Haven't I told you about it? - Yes. I've a start-up conference. You can narrate that even now. It'll be fun listening to it in this mood watching her. He is right. Narrate that story, Mr. Josy. I spoke with her for the first time during our tour to Ooty. We were in the twelfth grade then. I was afraid of talking to her before that. She was really studious. All of us, who sat at the back, were drunk. She came and sat near my seat at night and asked me something. 'Could you please close the window?' That made me really nervous. I was free from intoxication. I asked if she was feeling cold. She replied that the cold wind would make her vomit. I lied to her that my mom had told me a remedy to it. I asked her to keep a finger on her belly button for she wouldn't feel nauseous anymore. Pour me another drink. Abin, turn it inside out. Not like that. Turn it inside out. Turn it inside out? - Yes. Turn its inner surface outside? - Yes. Does that matter? Yes, it won't pill if it's hung like this. Oh! Technicalities. - Yes. Tell us the rest. She fell asleep while we were moving downhill. I had gone crazy as she came and talked to me and I was looking at her. I kept my hand on her abdomen when I felt that she was going to vomit. She kept her hand over mine. I tried to take away my hand. But she held my hand tight to her abdomen. Until we completed the descend.. "I want to shelter you." "But with the beast inside" "there is nowhere we can hide." - Abin. "No matter what.." What is it? Few of my clothes are missing. It will be there somewhere. Abin, I looked everywhere, but I couldn't find it. Where can it be? Abin, it's my undergarments that have gone missing. Where can it be? Abin, I don't find this funny. I'm sorry. 'So, I shifted people to the valleys' 'located behind the wall.' 'I kept the natives safe' 'with the help of my weapons.' 'I stood up and spoke to the rich men' 'and the commoners.' 'You need not be afraid of them.' 'He told us to fight for the well-being of our brothers' 'sons, daughters, wives and houses by keeping in our mind' 'that Jesus Christ is powerful and supreme.' 'Let's pray' 'to the Almighty.' 'Oh, Jesus!' 'We pray to You.' 'Oh, Lord! Please protect us.' 'We pray to You..' 'Oh, Lord! Please protect us..' Is duck meat available here? How come you crave duck meat all of a sudden? In the past when I used to visit my hometown, mom used to prepare 'Appam' and seasoned duck curry. It was really delicious. That's my brother's favourite. Shall we go to Bangalore and stay there for a few days? Brother keeps on calling me. Let's first sort out everything here. Okay. I'll ask Mr. Benny about the duck meat. It may not be as delicious as your mother's preparation. But I'll try. Abin. - Yes. Abin. - What happened? Abin.. A guy is standing there. - Who is it? He is looking through the window. That's a scarecrow. Can you please go and look? Don't shout. Abin.. What happened? What happened? Did you see the tape which I had kept here? Abin, what happened? Abin, what are you taking? He is working there. The issue will be resolved once we close that window. W-When will you be free next week? Let's do it that way then. Then.. Hello.. Who was it? - Thomas. He is my friend. He is your classmate, right? We were colleagues. He is from Kottayam. You can use my mobile phone if it is urgent. No, it's all right. - Its network is fine everywhere. Why is there a crowd? - Let's find out.. - What! Pull over. Don't lie. Shut up. - We've to leave immediately. I'll be right back. Just a minute, sir. I didn't do anything, sir. We were just talking. What's your relationship with her? - Tell us. You can't leave from here. Josy, what happened? - Ask him. What's your relationship with her? Let me ask.. - Sir.. - What is it? My friend and I were having a conversation inside the car. Do you think I'd buy it? She isn't his friend. - It's his girlfriend. Look at her. This is his so-called friend. - Lower the window.. Let me see the friend. You can't leave from here. - This is his friend. - You won't. What was the conversation all about? Let me explain. They've been here for a while and their behaviour was inappropriate. He was the one who noticed it first. Sir. - Where is your hometown.. - It's nearby. - Where exactly? Pala.. Pala.. Sir, please don't trouble me. Please.. How dare you.. Josy, what's the matter? They were snogging in the car. Oh, no! - Stand up. Get over here. - Oh, God! Leave him be. - Don't hurt me. Jithin! - Let go of me, Mr. Benny. - Listen to me. I'll fix this. I will. - Mister.. Just calm down. You need not interfere in this matter, Benny. Josy, let me talk. Sir, please don't hit me. Come here. Sir, it's nothing. We came here just to talk. They unnecessarily created a scene. Let me tell you something. You'd not want to mess with them. Don't take things from bad to worse. Sir, if you suspect me, please call the police. Let them resolve the issue. - Mister it will take them at least two hours to reach here. Are you going to make her stay here until then? Give them some money and solve this issue. I'll give you anything. Please help me leave from here. Give me the money that you've. I'll handle the rest. I don't have much money, sir. Give me whatever you've. Handle the issue yourself with this money. This is all I've got. I don't even have money for fuel. Don't you dare come here ever again! Do you get me? - I won't come. - Go. Can I go? - Yes. Get lost! Here you go. Go. - Go. Leave. Y-You must pay me as I noticed it first. - Here you go. That's how it should be, right? W-What? This is very less. It's a meagre amount. - Get lost.. - You! Get lost! Don't you dare come here again! She is not letting me record a proper video. You will get hit by the car. Move! Such scoundrels show up here. I felt sorry for her. Else, I'd not have let him get away with it. Mr. Benny, God created all these forests and mountains for human beings. Sir, you're so philosophical. It's a verse from the Bible. Do you remember me, Priya Paul? I studied in the class, 12 B. My name is Josy K Baby. I see. When did you arrive? - A week ago. I see. What does your husband do? He was working for an IT firm in Dubai. IT industry is in decline, right? I saw him on the way. What do you do? I run a textiles shop in the town. My family has farmed all this land. - All right. I'm coming. Okay. Let me go inside. I've some work to do. Oh. You can contact me if you need any help. Sure. - I'll be nearby. Shall I give you my contact number? Let me. You can call me up if you need any help. Okay. Thank you. How did it go? - She took my contact number. She will surely call you. She might be taking a shower. Hey! You should not ogle her. If you're serious about her, we won't ogle her. Johnny, haven't I fulfilled all your wishes? I'll always do. You're incredible, Josy! "Oh, my love!" "This song is for you." "Oh, my love.." "A song from my heart.." "Oh, beloved! You touched" "my heart." "You touched" "my heart." "Thankamma, you eloped with a stranger.." "Are you satisfied now?" "Thankamma.." What happened? - Abin, can't you hear it? "You eloped with a stranger.. Are you satisfied.." Use this. It's not just that. How dare they step into our land and ruin our peace of mind? Dear, this is a village. People work till evening. They then have a couple of drinks and sing folk songs. That gives them happiness. This is not a folk song. They are singing it to annoy me. I can't tolerate it any more! "Thankamma.." "Thankamma, you eloped with a stranger." "Are you satisfied now?" "Thankamma, you eloped with a stranger." "Are you satisfied now?" Hey, stop it.. He is coming here. Sir, be careful. What's the matter? Could you please stop singing? My wife and I are working. - He is unable to work! Hey.. Shut up. They are youngsters. Just ignore them. You could've said this from there. You needn't have come here. It's all right. My wife has some health issues. No, sir. We won't sing anymore. We have stopped. - Okay. - Okay. There will soon be a wedding in the family. That's why. Pour a drink for him. - No.. Why? Don't you drink? I.. - Have a drink before you leave. I.. - Have it. - Have it for us. Say, 'Cheers', sir. Cheers. Would you like to have some more? - No. This is enough.. Okay. Thank you.. Poor guy. They got a bit carried away with the wedding celebration. So.. Did you drink? Just one shot. Why did you drink with them? Abin, this isn't Bangalore or Dubai. You've no clue about their character. They stopped singing when we asked them to. So, when they offered me a drink, I didn't feel like rejecting it. What's wrong in that? There is nothing wrong, Abin.. - Talk to me. Talking to you is pointless. Whatever! Where is your mother? - She has gone to work, sir. How is Sandra? I saw her at Contractor Pappalli's house. It's going on. You're blushing! Was yours a love marriage? - What! Was yours a love marriage? Yes. It happened. Okay, sir. I'm leaving. I've to attend the class. Are you really going to the class? Yes.. Priya! What are you doing? Step back. - Move aside. Priya! Whose mobile phone is this? Whose mobile phone is this? I got this from the bathroom. Bathroom? Who would keep it there? Priya. Hey, what are you doing? Get up. Move aside, Abin. I've no peace of mind since I came here. What are you looking for? Whom are you calling up? - Abin, just a minute. Just a minute, Abin. This is Josy's mobile phone. Abin, I know them since my school days. They are scoundrels! I know how to handle it. - Hey, what are you doing? Abin.. - Sit here. Let us calmly talk and decide. None of them should enter our property hereafter. We're cancelling the contract. Abin, I don't want to feel so scared in my own house. I can't even use the bathroom peacefully. Relax. I'll talk to them. It might be a misunderstanding. Josy. - Yes. Is this your mobile phone? - Yes. How did this break? I'd given it to Biju for repairing its display. Who broke it? What's the issue, Uncle? - Go inside. Eat something and go to the church. I shouldn't have given it to a moron like him. I told you, right? Our boys won't do that. You brat! - What is it? I'm sure. - What! You'd kept the phone there. Show it to me as well. Hey.. Just leave it be. As for the contract you can't cancel it just like that. Definitely not for such trivial issues. But I'll warn the boys to not trouble you when they enter your property. Isn't that enough? You may please leave, sir. The wedding is on the horizon. We're busy making its arrangements. And one more thing, sir. This is a village. It has its own rules. Your wife and you should keep that in mind. All right then. You're leaving, right? How long is your leave, Mr. Baby? Were the problems of the area sorted out? No, not at all. We can resolve all the issues if we're given complete freedom for two days. What's the matter, Brother-in-law? Some people are keen on wasting others' time. Abin, what happened? That was just a confusion. He had given his mobile phone for repair. Abin, I've got no confusion regarding this. Abin, don't be so naive. It wasn't the right time to talk even if he were responsible. They were busy with the wedding of his eldest daughter. Sandra's elder sister's wedding. You need not do anything, Abin. You haven't understood it. I explained everything to the contractor. He promised me that they won't trouble us. Abin, I'm not interested in listening to this. Why are you worrying so much? We could always approach the police. If they trouble us anymore, we'll handle them legally. Did you eat anything? Come. Let's eat something. Come, dear. Shall we go for a drive to Kottayam day after tomorrow? Is it for meeting Thomas? Yes, he is free. No, Abin. I've some urgent work to finish. The deadline is already over. But I won't stay here alone. I'll go to the convent's library. Are you sure? - Yes. You can go without any worries. You guys will be discussing business. What will I do there? You could've woken me up. I didn't want to. What would you do waking up so early? Am I looking fine? Awesome. Shall I leave? - Okay. How will you go to the convent? On my dad's scooter. - Okay. Call up Mr. Benny if you need any help. I'll call you before I start from there. Okay. All the best. - Thank you. Take care. I know that you're angry with me. I wanted to tell you something personally. There shouldn't be any misunderstanding between us. Okay, bye. Ms. Priya, don't close the door. I got to know about it when my uncle informed me. I'd really given that phone for repair at Biju's shop. Ask Johnny if you think that I'm lying. You should leave. My husband is not here. I've nothing to talk to you. How dare you! Didn't Josy tell you that he is innocent? Johnny, no. Since Ms. Priya has said.. I've nothing to talk to you. 'Pappalli's.' Pull over. What happened? - Reverse the car. Come. - What's the matter? Just come. Hey! - J-Josy.. Josy.. Please.. - Let go of me. Don't hit him. - Come here. Come here! - Listen to me. Josy, let go of him. Take her. - Brother. - Come. - You! Brother. - Don't beat me up, sir. Listen to me, Brother. Brother, stop. - You! - Don't beat him up. - Stop.. No. Come, Johnny.. - Don't hit him, Brother. Hey. Come here. Come here. Hey.. We shall deal with him later. Come, Jithin. Priya.. Priya. 'The number that you're trying to reach is not responding.' 'Please try again later.' 'The number that you're trying to reach is not responding.' 'Please try again later.' What happened? - Nothing serious. She met with a minor accident. She is fine as someone brought her here on time. You need not worry. Where is she? - There. Doctor, this is Abin. He is her husband. There is nothing to worry. She just has a few minor injuries. She is still in shock of the accident. She was crying profusely to go home. Are you done dressing the wounds, Nurse? - Yes. Did you get scared? There is nothing to worry. You can take her home after buying these medicines. Priya. Priya. What happened? Priya. Stop. Don't you want the key? Priya. Priya. Priya.. Priya. Priya. Priya. What are you doing? I'm talking to you. Abin, go out. Tell me the matter. - For what? I told you umpteen number of times. You can't do anything, Abin. - What did I do? You never did anything. They know very well that you won't react. They are the ones who left me in the hospital in the evening. You won't understand the abuse and the violence that I had suffered today. We can't ignore this any more. Come. Let's go to the police station. We've to register a complaint. - For what? I don't want to be the victim of verbal abuse as well. There is no evidence that I was hit by their vehicle. No one saw them leaving me in the hospital. Who'd then believe me if I say that they did it? They will say that I'm being delusional. I know that no one will be there by my side. But deep inside.. I know what happened to me. Abin, don't touch me today. I don't think I can live here safely with you. I don't think I'd be safe with you anywhere. This wouldn't have happened to me if my dad was alive. Priya. Abin, please leave me alone. Just leave. Sir.. Who is it? Sir.. Sir, can you take us to the police station? Please sit. What happened? Sandra and I were talking to each other. Mr. Josy and the others saw us. They took her. They thrashed me severely. Mr. Murugan told us that if they see him, they won't spare him. They are looking for him, sir. It's them, sir. - Go inside. Go inside. Why are you standing outside, sir? Did your wife kick you out of the house! I just wanted some fresh air. Did that boy, who supplies milk, come here? No. I saw him entering your compound. I didn't see him. Inform us if you see him. - Okay. Let us take your leave. Brother, it was obvious from his demeanour that they were inside. This is his slipper. You could've dragged him outside, right? You brat! I've told you not to interrupt me while I'm talking to my brother. Don't try to act smart! Oh, God! Can you guys stop? Give me some peace of mind. I'll handle this. Johnny, keep quiet. Sir, let me come to the point. Send that milkmaid and her son with us. He has done something unforgivable. I'll take them to the police station tomorrow morning. We can settle the issue there. - You needn't do anything! Don't act like you're his father and shelter them! Calm down. - Brother-in-law Baby I had asked him politely. But he lied to me then. Leave it be. Sir, a wedding is going to happen in our family. These kinds of incidents will defame us. Call them. We'll talk to him. We didn't come here to invite you to the wedding. There is a proverb. You might not have heard it. 'One must not feed a stray dog.' - Shut up! How dare you raise your voice at my home! No matter what, I won't let you take them tonight. I'll handle you alone. Let's not waste time talking to this scoundrel. Go inside and bring them. This is not your home to barge in when your dad asks you to! I won't let anyone enter my house and take them! Stay in that room. Dear, don't cry. - Don't cry. Just shut up. Sabu, bring a cloth immediately. Hold his hand. Dad, do it carefully. Brother, we shouldn't spare him. We must chop him into pieces! I won't spare him as he has injured my son. We'll leave only after murdering him! Mark my words! Break the door. - Come. - Take all the weapons from the jeep. Brother. Kunjimon. Hey. I suffered an electric shock. Drat! There. Brother, here you go. Let's see how long they could stay inside the house. Brother-in-law, give that to me. Josy, disconnect the internet and phone cable. No one should find out even if they die. Sabu, come. - Come.. You were wrong when you said he is good-for-nothing. They won't escape from this house, Johnny. Just wait and watch. Kick it. - You! Hey! Open it. Brother-in-law, what was he doing in Dubai? - I don't know. Josy, reverse the jeep. Why did they come here? I've no clue, Baby. Don't touch the door.. You'll suffer an electric shock. Break the door with a log. Let's first move him. Kunjimon, come. Careful.. Make him sit on the sofa. Careful.. Slowly. Hit it with more force! What's the matter, sir? The police? Yes, sir. Don't open the door no matter what happens outside. Abin. - Don't worry. Nothing untoward will happen to us. Close the door. Uncle. - Dad. Don't spare him. I reckon he is a Maoist or terrorist. You scoundrel! Come out if you've the guts! You.. Bring him! You could leave. Someone else is on the way to take them. Come, Brother-in-law. Don't be scared. Nothing bad will happen. Hey! Don't forget to bring the milk in the evening. Try entering my house. Neither the police nor the army could sue me. You are unfortunate that there are laws that would acquit me.
