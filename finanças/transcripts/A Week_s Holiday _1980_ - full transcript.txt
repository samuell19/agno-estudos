Prices rise up in january: plus 1,9%. It's the worst case in 21 years. The CGT says the real number is 2,2%. The minister of economy said that the situation could only get better. Laurent Fabius said that Georges Marchais is like a football player specialized in scoring against his own team. Lyon. Winter 1980. Yesterday, Raymond Barre has made a surprizing declaration while asked about the question of unemployment by communists militants. You know, Anne? I found that piece of work that I gave to that pupil of mine at the end of the year. He had to complete sentences like "I would like to... " "I have dreamt... ", "Nothing is... ", etc. I put some bits of it together. "I'd like to be an animal, to watch others without speaking. " "I'd like to know what people really think of me. " "I'd like to be a boy, just to know how it feels. " "Nothing's worse than being shy. " "Nothing's more dangerous than a broken motorcycle. " "Nothing's more beautiful than a chess board. " "I dreamt I was the mailman, giving happiness to everyone. " "I dreamt I was a typewriter that didn't make any faults. " "I dreamt that my parents were happy together. " Can we go, captain? Finish your meal, I'm tired of screwing with a skeleton. The first fag is Ro, because Ro fucks Pierre. [Ro baise Pierre] The second was To, because: To fucks Hambourg. To fucks Hambourg. Yeah, I get it. Sorry, I thought that.. Yes? No sir, he's not here sir. I'm Conchita, the spanish housemaid. No, tonight he's going to see prostitutes. Well, okay. I'm coming. Take care. Bye. Come on, let's go. I'm always the one waiting. Put the lights off. Life's not easy, hmm? Well, let me finish. The third faggot is Ma, because Ma hides Bono while he screws, "Ma hides Bono screwing. " It's a clever one, isn't it? You have a cigarette? I just quit smoking in the staircase. ONE WEEK OF HOLIDAYS Public education: "Filling the heads full of all those condemned to live. " [Jacques Prevert] Laurence, Laurence! You're not going to the school? Leave me alone. Are you feeling ill? I'll return home. I'll feel better. I'll call Grenoble, I'll say I can't go. I can't leave you like this. It's all right, really. Sabouret will give me some medicine. You'll get a fee now for your car. I don't care. Leave me, please. Come on now. Laurence Cuers! Just a little longer and I wouldn't have been able to leave the car. I had to avoid going to the school. That's what scared me. What did your pupils do, did they sell drugs or what? It's not about them, it's about me. Of course.. Anyway, you'll take a week of vacations as soon as possible. And don't fool around with Pierre. Take a good rest. He just called me. He's not in Lyon? He's gone to Grenoble a few days to sell houses. Call him tonight or he'll have a nervous breakdwon, too. Take this three times a day, before dinner. You should have taught maths, that's something solid. Even after may 69, maths stayed the same. Only Marchais could have been able to mess that up, and still. Will you read me? Don't be stupid. I'm not kidding, didn't you see Debray-Ritzen on TV? If you were to put them through a real test, not half the children would be judged fit to go to school. Also, we discovered dyslexia. So, when you start again, take it easy. Is Heredia still taught in school? "The beautiful bottom of the pale madrepore" We send them straight to the factory. Can I dry my hair? A beer. You plant a tree and then forget it. You think that's ecology. I give a dime to the bathroom lady. She thinks I'm being nice. We're leftists just because it's in. /i> We're already revolutionaries. Mancheron, you'll go to the director. She's a bitch. Ok, you'll go to the disciplinary committee then. I don't care, your life's finished anyway. Sending a kid to the disciplinary commitee! Deep inside he's a good kid. I think he likes me. Everybody makes mistakes, Laurence. Maybe we should quit this job then. But we still pay our taxes for we're still afraid of cops. One-way! - Hello. - Thank you for coming. I'm glad to see you. I bought some sweets, so we can get high on sugar. It's cold outside. I almost forgot, Tubiana gave me the homework of your pupils for you. Here. Do you see how much there is? I'm sure it's gonna be bad, too. Some are quite good. See the first one for example. You're beeing fooled, Anne. His parents must vote left, that's all. It's dreadly conventionnal although it's on our side. So it's true your depressed! Don't tell me... The more you let them express themselves the worse it gets. We go to the expos, we do audiovisual, "parrallele activities" and all we get is cliches. The only difference is how bad they write. I prefere when you tell us what we must do. Why so? It's more work to think it up ourselves. Actually, they're not all stupid. 1978 was the year of the woman, 1979, that of children, and 1980, the return of the sadistic teacher! I don't like it when you talk like this. You didn't even take a chocolate. Do you want to sleep here? When I was little I used to think I was shrinking at night in my bed. My body got so little that it became just a dot. And that dot was going away until it melted in the void. I was afraid, but, I always pushed the dot further but it never disappeared. Why are you laughing? It reminds me of my first boyfriend. We never had an intimate talk. One night, I told him a story that happened to me when I was little. As soon as we put off the light, I thought there was a corpse under my bed with its eyes wide open. So I didn't move, otherwise he would wake up, and that would be terrible. Something of an offense. And he would take revenge. It was my friend. My boyfriend just answered "Well, that's pretty common. " For me it was like giving a wonderful present to one's mother and finding it the next day in a closet. Tell me, why did you become a teacher? I didn't want to. But then I liked it. I didn't want anything, only to be a pirate. What is it? It's the chocolate? Yes, that's it. How much? I'll tell you. Let's say 20 francs. How much?! Okay, 10 then. 10 francs. You take it then? Hello. What would you like? I've got a nice one here. Do you like it? It's a beautiful flower. And it lasts long, too. It's a strong plant. You want it? Miss Cuers! Hello, can I help you? That's a strange plant. Jean told me you were ill. Oh, you miss school on purpose! I knew it! I did that a lot, unfortunately my teachers never did! Let's celebrate! Come on, we'll have a drink. That's something to celebrate! So this is your restaurant? Jean didn't tell you? Sausage for table number 3! Are you staying for dinner? I've got some nice crawfishes. Not today. It's for the flower. But next time with Jean, sure. A teacher missing school.. That's amazing! I thought only the pupil did, I mean the bad ones, like I was. Something happened to me once as a child.. I wanted to miss school. It was around two a clock, I told my father: "I'm going to my english class. " So I went to the parc. It was a place were I thought I wouldn't meet anyone. But 20 minutes later.. 20 minutes later, two large avenues, with absolutely no-one, and then, "plof" I met my father on the spot. I can still remember his eyes.. I never get used to it.. I hope I didn't break it. It's on the floor anyway. I didn't want to, I didn't see your bike. It's a motorcycle. I'm looking for Miss Cuers. Yes, that's me. Very well.. My name is Mancheron, I am Jean's father. Poor Jean! But I expected you on Tuesday. I couldn't come. And since I was in the neighborhood. But, if you're busy.. No, it's all right. Let's go in my class room. You tell Anne. Follow me. Volleyball is nice. Jean likes sports, right? Yes, unlike everything else. Excuse me. It's still the same. What? The smell. Someone forgot his things. Sit down. I wanted to talk about Jean. It's nothing serious, don't worry. I don't worry, but, the disciplinary comitee.. It will get better. He's witty, and nice. He's plain bad. Oh, no. I have bad ones, you know. But lately he's become agressive. Maybe he has problems. How is it going at home? He's like everyone.. TV, friends.. Does he have brothers and sisters? No, he hasn't. And your wife, does she work? No, she died when he was ten. But it's not a trauma for him. I forgot my things. Well, if you don't work, with all that.. What's he into? Does he talk with you? I don't know.. He likes bikes. Does he read? Never. He gets books on his birthdays, but it drives him mad. It's like an allergy. I didn't like school, either. In religion class, they threw me out. We were talking about earthly paradise, Adam and Eve.. So they asked: "Does anybody have any questions?" The fool I was, instead of keeping silent, I asked: "Let's see.. He created the apple, He created the desire to eat it. He knew they would eat it, yet he put it there. If I don't want somebody to eat something, I don't put it on the table!" "Get out, Belzebuth!" they shouted. I thought you were ill? Lucie, it's nice you're here. Come. You want to drink something? Water, maybe. You were thirsty! Mama says I drink too much. What class did you have? I think I'm dumb. What do you mean? Just that. Hi. Hello. You're busy? I have a pupil here. I got a letter from mom. Wait for me at the restaurant. It was my brother. I just wanted to say that. Anyway, it's stupid. Wait Lucie, stay here. I'm glad to see you. Why do you think this? I have bad marks, and there are other things. What things? Everything. I don't know, I don't understand the explanations. I can't do it.. I don't understand things. Even the movies. I don't say it, but often I don't understand. You see it, in class. Not being good in french doesn't mean anything. But when we have to work together, it's unbearable. Everybody's talking, and I don't know what to say. It doesn't matter. It's not about being smart. It's hard to learn some things, but it has nothing to do with that. The fact you've come here proves you're smart. Many were bad at school yet they succeeded in life. It's not just school. Listen.. Nobody is beautiful, smart at school, tender and strong altogether. We all have something less and something more. If I were a painter, I would like to paint your eyes: they're as beautiful as inside the woods. Cats are happy to play and birds to fly. But a cat would be unhappy if it dreamt of flying. I'll try to help you. Together we'll make it. Being happy is what matters in life. The rest doesn't matter. You want to eat with my brother and myself? It's about dad. He's going back to the hospital by the end of the month. We have to pay part of it. How much? First the laboratories... I don't need the details. Just tell me how much. Mom gets lost in this. You didn't count it all? Well no. She would like you to come by, you don't come these days. I know you have little time. I like your pullover. How's your work? It didn't work. We were exploited. We were fed up. So you're not working as usual? I'm searching. There's nothing interesting, or too far away. I have to go now. You want a dessert? Apple or lemmon-cake? Apple. One apple-cake please. And a pack of Gitanes. Here. Thanks. You're coming sunday? I don't know. I'm going to the theater tonight with a friend. Will you come with us? Okay. I pick you up at school? No, we'll meet at the cinema. Bye. Bye. I thought you weren't going to school? No, I'm not going. But you told him... I don't want to see him this afternoon. He bores me. I was afraid you'd screw up, but you were fantastic. I don't get it. It was you who proposed to write a script. It was a great idea. But in your work there's nothing. Nothing. Only cliches, not a trace of imagination. They killed our imagination. They killed our imagination? You heard that on TV, it's not from you? Yes it is. Because school... School... Quite handy to blame school isn't it? Then you only have to wait and blame others. At this rate, you're old at the age of 20. The lights are coming back. Ugly. The film's over. I wake up the guy next to me, he's sleeping like a newborn. I get up of my chair, I want to yawn. It was the last sequence, it was the last screening. Now it's over. No, he's not here. Tomorrow. Bye. The words "The End" can make you laugh or cry. But I know the fate of a small theater like this. It will end as a garage or a supermarket. There's no hope about it. It was the last screening. Now it's over. Farewell, the heroes I loved. The intermission's over. Farewell, for ever and ever, to the ice-creams also. If I could have chosen my father it would have been Gabin for sure. Did you like it? Yeah. Wasn't it on TV? Yes, I think so. Okay, I have to go then. I've got a meeting for a job tomorrow. We walk you home? No, I'm on my motorcycle. Bye. You should come at my house sometime. Next week? Okay. He's nice. It's hard to talk with him for me. I'm seeing Philippe tonight. I think I don't love him anymore. Already? Come on.. I think I want to fall in love so much, that I often mistake making love for it. Don't you? The worst is when the man you think you love kisses you and you don't care anymore. But suddenly, it comes back and you don't know why. Is it love or desire? I'm gonna give up everything. What, Pierre? No. School? Yes. You just feel sad. What would you do? It's crazy. Anything. Writing. You can very well write a book and have a job at the same time. Come, let's meet Philippe together. Come on, you look depressed. I just had a great idea. You'll sit next to us, so you can hear everything. Tell me what you think of him. Okay? It's him? Yes, shut up. Am I late? No, I just got here. If we have just one hour, wear a skirt. I need to feel your legs. You want something? You, you. I want the same as you. Since last night, I can only think of your legs. So soft and nice around my neck. Philippe... Wait. Let me finish. Other women have a rough pussy. Once I slept with a black woman. But you, it's so soft, it's like silk, like the hair of a baby. Did you just become crazy? I can't help it, I make bubbles. Bye. I never heard him talking spanish. He must be a spy. But he's cute, don't you think? And so poetic. I'll call him. We weren't nice. Pierre isn't here? No, you know it. You want me to stay? No, I'll go to sleep. Bye. Laurence! You won't give up? We'll see. It's snowing. Who is it? Social security control. What time is it? 8 o' clock, madam. Fuck! You can leave the house from 10 to 16. So, I come before or after. It's logical. It seemed strange to me. Yeah, don't tell me... Careful. You were ready to punch the face of that poor controller! You're really silly. You're not going to school? No. You dress sexy when I'm not here. Hello. Now I'm here, we have to take it off. Leave me. You're welcome. I smell like gasoline. They won't poor it for you so I always spill some on myself. It's bullshit! Well, I'll just make some coffee. Still no sugar? I forgot to buy it. She forgot... Can you spare a cigarette? No, I've quit. Tell me, Cap'tain, you know the story of the pregnant woman who wonders if the child's really hers? So? Well since she's a woman, it has to be hers, no? Everything all right in there? Everything in order? Stole it in the caf. Sorry but I got just one. At least THEY are talking. These days, kids are not like their parents, they ressemble the times. Jean isn' a Mancheron, he's a "80's". The uniform, like the house. One doesn't live in a house with a door like this, a garden like that, a green balcony. No, one lives in a "F3". Funny, we always want our children to be exceptionnal. Not necessarily president, that would rather displease me, but different, with a little something, a sparkling light. I used to write fairy tales. I'd rather have had a girl: I could have read tales to her. I'm sure a little girl would've like them. You, did you like them? Yes, but no-one read them to me. Boys are rude. I know it doesn't show, but, I do like finesse. If I had had a teacher like you, I'd have payed attention in class. Or perhaps, no, I'd have been dreaming, but quietly. I wasn't a quiet pupil at all... The teachers, back then, were often bastards. What punishments they were able to imagine! Humiliating the children like sadists. I still have dreams were I spit at their face. I hated school so much that I never walked Jean there. The other day, that was the first time I ever went there since. Does Jean know that you wanted a girl? He knows that I prefer girls to boys. But not that I wanted one. Hard to be a kid, too. You have to please your parents. I know it's not easy. One blunder after the other. I don't feel him anymore, it's risky, because, when two people fall appart, it goes fast, the distance. Very fast. You know teachers who don't give a fuck about their pupils, who don't get involved in their work, they never miss a class. They're always there. They've been boring everyone for 30 years, if there's a strike they don't take part. Perhaps, but I don't picture myself going to my boss and saying: "Mr. Schmurz, I need 3 weeks holidays, I can't take it anymore. " It's true I build houses, not kids. By the way, there's still no sugar in my coffee. You know the story of the guy who drinks his coffee without sugar and tells a girl who's naked in the bath: "You're great at making love. " And she answers: "I know"? So that guy, he stares at his cup of coffee, and drinks it up, since he has nothing to say, the dumbass. You know that story? Gotta put up some good will with the stories. I'll be going then. I don't like when you lock yourself up in the bathroom. Some people drown in their bathtub. Seriously. It's all right, Pierre, it's fine. Okay, bye then. The kitchen, the living-room, and the TV. But we put the kitchen close to the living-room. So it's more handy for the one cooking. So it comes in handier for you. I don't cook. That's me. Okay, well, we can go see the kitchen now. Normally the kitchen is larger than this. But there's a cellar in this one, so it's smaller in size than usual. Hello ma'am. I'll wait for you outside. I just sell the kitchen and I come. Were you longing for me? What would you say of a house like this just for you and me? With walls so thin I could hear your heart beating from the next room? Why do you sell them if that's so? I thought professionnal conscience was only for intellectuals. The sad thing is the stupid jobs make more money. Did I say your job was stupid? No, you never talk about it, that's worse. Because I only talk about my job. Women are all the same you know, talkative, egocentrical, and very, very mean. I want to take a walk in the park. The say that in America even grown-ups do roller-skating. Must be fun. Laurence. Come here. Don't quit your job. You won't hold up without the kids. Hey, you take a ride? Can I? I'm going to Bellecourt. Me to the Cordeliers. You don't mind? Excuse me. I thought you didn't work on tuesdays? I changed the day because of the kids, and I replace Charlie on monday evening. Was the Ardche nice? Fantastic! The kids loved it. Same for us. Playings cards, drinking beer. A bit foggy, but the weather was perfect. The only problem was we were invaded by dutch people. And you? I'm doing fine. Annie went to see her mother, she has problems with rats. How annoying! But it'll get better. Madam, did you read my work? No, I told you already. For the one time I had it done... It was not bad, I had a couple of ideas. My father liked it too. I'll look into it. You want one? No thanks. It's for my parents, since I never have a good grade. As for me, I don't care. Madam! I thought you were sick? You're coming to the class? No, I'm going to the doctor. But I'll be there next week. You all right? So you're here? Since when? You're early. I want to make love. I want to make love. If you saw the people working at my father's office.. One of them, in his fourties, goes to the bathroom to read the paper. He daren't read it in front of his boss. They're all scared like that. Where did you buy those eggs? Why don't you just let me do it? I do it because I'm so nice. If they weren't scared, they'd be talking bullshit anyway. I'd rather have that. If you're allowed to express yourself from childhood on, one day you'll say something beautiful, even if it's just once. We used to put them in jail. Today we despise them for not talking. It's like sexual doctors. They once used to tell you what you shouldn't do. No they tell you what you should do, where when and how. You like that better? I dunno. It must be ready now, no? Just a bit more. Didn't you put that upside down? Still, doubting can be good. I dislike people who think they know everything. You people read more books than anyone and yet you know nothing. Is that the idea? Don't get upset. I'm not upset. I just have it with intellectuals claiming "Fuck culture", just like when rich people despise money. Let them give it to others first, then we'll see. If they want to burn the books let them read them first. Doubt is a privilege. Children need the sure things first. If you don't give that to them, they'll just end up being lost. A whole generation of bums, that's a bit much. It's not working with those eggs, I've had it! Those eggs! I work myself out, but it won't do if you buy eggs like those. The education is more democratic now, it fits the capacities of the children, doing away with any kind of selection. With all those help crasses for instance. Sorry I meant help classes, to help the ones lagging behind. She's stupid! Stupid! What a surprise! But what time is it? I always eat beforehand. You want some? I've eaten already. Come on, just have a little. I'm making myself something delicious, you can have a glass of wine, and try this too. You can't refuse it, it's all home-made. Here's a tiny salad with some eggs. You're going away? Seeing my parents in the Beaujolais. Jean's mother was from there. Don't hesitate. Are you enjoying your holidays? In front of my house there's an old lady living alone. Just in front. I never saw her before. Can we eat? We're full. Looks empty to me. It looks like it but it's not. It's nice to come along. I must grab something at Saint Jean. It's on the way. And there's no-one before 5. It's here! Number 35. For 15 years Mancheron was happy there. We had a pub at Saint Paul. Then I sold it and we moved off. I said it was because of Jean, but it was not. It's funny. You love some people so much you're afraid of remembering them. It hurts too much. My wife was too nice. I think she even married me just to be gentle. It's good you're going to Saint Paul. We couldn't have gone to Perrache. I tried going there the other day. I didn't understand, with all those crossroads, one-ways, and whatever else, but I ended up on the highway to Valence. I take off again, and then, I find myself in the tunnel of Fourvires. Rousseau, come here! Livie! You come with me. Rousseau! Sorry I didn't see you. Here. I heard she had a rough time? Perhaps she should just change her job. You'll do it again? Will you? Hi mom. What, you got even thinner? I don't know. Give it to me. It's all right. It's still changing, what are they building there? One day I wont be able to recognize anything. Countries change faster than people. How's dad? As always. He'll be happy to see you. So they gave you a week holidays? You're lucky to have a job where you can do that. Put your bag here. I'll bring it in your room. I'll do it later. You want to wash your hands? Public transports are dirty. You can change clothes too. I don't like seeing you in jeans. I'll say hello to dad first. Hi dad. You see? Laurence came to see us as I told you. You look well. Do you want more water? Guess who I met? Marcel's daughter, you know, the girl who looked a bit dumb. She works in a shop at Valence. I'm glad to see you. I believe that's all. They still ask the birthdates of your children. Even though they know it for 20 years already. I hope you checked it all well? Cause last time... Last time I forgot to make you sign one paper. That's why they sent it all here again it's not my fault if they're stupid. You want some help? No it's allright. You'll bring him up his tea, he'll be happy. He was so glad to see you. They give him pills so he's not in pain. Of course, he doesn't talk much, but he was never very talkative. Does he read? Yeah, the news of the country. He listens to the radio. I'll taste it. I don't use much salt, it's no good for him. It's nice like this. Everything was very expensive. The hospital, the doctors... I know mom, I saw. Let me do it. No, it's dirty if it stays here. You can't rest for a minute. Here. Don't let it get cold. Drink your tea. I'll make someone repair it. That would be better. I'll leave you with Laurence. Soon she'll start feeding me. I used to be so skilled with my hands. So skilled. You don't like it do you? But we love each other. That's what matters. You know what joke my pupils did to me last year? They exchanged rooms. I came in the morning, and found the pupils I had the year before. They were all ready to work, no-one laughing. I wondered if I was getting crazy. Then one of them raised his hand and asked: Are we going on with Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme? I felt so stupid, I didn't know what to do. I told them it was very funny but they had to go back to their class. Saying that, I realized that they all expected me to play the game with them. But I didn't know how. I couldn't. I watched them leaving the room. I'm sure they hold it against me. Take it. It's some jelly, I know you like it. Thanks. You said you were staying for three days. I've got a lot of work to do. Before you go, we could pay a visit to Marie Thrse? She'd be pleased. But we wont have the time. She used to be your best friend. She always wants to hear from you. I'd rather be with you, mom. Bye dad. You know so much, so much. Will you marry Pierre? I don't know. I'd have been fine with Eric! You told me already: he was perfect. He had everything: a good education, a good job... But I wasn't happy. I don't understand you Laurence. You're 31, without children. It's about time, don't wait until you're too old. Do you really want a child? I don't know. I want to, but I'm scared. But a little girl... Boys are good too. Yes, they are. Dutch people came the other day to visit the house. You should sell it, and find a place under the sun. We have the sun here too. Nothing is softer than your softness. I dreamt that I was the postman bringing happiness to everyone. I dreamt that my parents got reconcilied at the spectacle where I danced. She's afraid of the break of the war because of the children she'll have. She's afraid to die young of illness. She's afraid to sleep in the dark. She's afraid of hospitals and injections. He's afraid to go back to sleep and find his nightmare waiting for him. It's Laurence Cuers, is Pierre here? Tomorrow evening? Yes, I came back earlier. All right then. Could he call me back? Thanks. Laurence. I've had enough. I want a child from you. A child is something real, is that what's you're afraid of? When one's really in love, one wants a child. I don't know. What don't you know? If you love me enough? You always exagerate. It's not just to keep you. But if you go away, and I'd have a child from you, my life would be meaningful. Help me. Please help me! I want a child from you. Are you afraid of something real? One wants a child when one's really in love. I thought I was normal, quite content with myself not too good nor too bad, but in fact I'm banal, not far from being a zero. I'm just a number. I've got a postal code, just a number, another for the social security, and for the taxes. Now I've got a trial, they think I'm handsome. I'm just a number. That's why I like to go out at night, get drunk to prove myself I'm alive, find love without even asking her name, to run and lie without reason. The only way for me to save myself, to breathe and find a reason to live, create myself a world without numbers. I dream of myself making the show. But at dawn I'm just a number. Okay. Good. Good evening. Good evening. I'd like to eat here. I'm alone this evening and I want to make the best out of it. But I don't serve dinner in the evening. But you can still stay here, though it'll be upstairs then. The waters boiling already. A little Montrachet? It's sane and natural. Sir! One Beaujolais, please. Excuse me. One bottle please. It would be even better if it came with a pretty girl. That's a rare thing these days. Good. I just got a call from a cousin, when I came in. He told me they had no room left, in the family grave! Have to make room for the new ones. He asked me if he could put uncle Victor next to aunt Adele. Since they're dead for 25 years, I guess they don't really care. Then he got very serious and told me: "We don't wanna make a blunder. " That's what he said. "Because uncle Victor and aunt Adele didn't talk to each other. " "They hated each other, and never talked at all. " So I told him: "As they are now, I doubt they'll get into a fight". He was horrified. Is that bottle coming? Just a minute. It's here. This way. It smells good! I made a "gratin dauphinois". Jean isn't here? I told him to go see his friend. I'm only waiting for Michel Descombes. Can I come in? He's here. Hello. Hi. It smells like gratin dauphinois, that's gonna be good. Laurence Cuers, Jean's teacher. Michel Descombes. So it is you who is trying to make Jean become clever? That musn't be easy. And he's surely not the only one! They say that ignorance is progressing these days. Bernard just changed his job. He works in a library now. That's better. My son. He's incarcerated at Saint Paul. It's been five years. What used to be his work? Knitting work. Knitting for five years for five francs a day can be tiring. Is he still holding up? Yes. It depends. The hardest thing is to hear the trains. He can't accustom himself to it. Especially during the holidays. What were they thinking, putting a prison next to a train station! Are we drinking something or what? Sure, just sit down. They described me as a "totally stubborn pupil". Harsh, isn't it? "Totally stubborn pupil": in short, no hope for him! And you? It was more subtle. Less overwhelming. My math teacher wrote: "I don't see the use of having this pupil in my class". Not bad either. He is something special though. He hated school so much, he didn't only skip class or just make noise. He actually learned false lessons in order to trick his father. Yes, I learnt those of the year before. My father didn't understand anything: "You know it by heart yet you get a 0!". You have another? Was it rebellion? No, that's saying too much. I was just an awful pupil, that's all. But you know, life's awful when you're bad at school. It's a nightmare, people have no idea. You can't imagine the angst of such a pupil. You're scared to death of being questionned. It's true, it really is. Now we're laughing, but it's truly terrible. I remember a teacher, he wasn't mean, but every morning, with his lips like this: "Recite!" We were all shaking with fear, who's it gonna be? And, tac! he chose you. In the evening, your parents would scold you. Above all, the worst was the contempt in the teachers' eye. I had a teacher of history and geography, when he caught someone sleeping in his class, he hit him with his ruler and said: "I don't want a bum here!" And that makes you laugh! I find it funny that someone would end like that after going to the university. Once we made an awful joke to him. I paid a beggar to come in class and sing a song. And he sang for two hours in the street. He stopped once in a while, silence: and then suddenly he would sing even louder. Awful! Do they do such things to you? An obscene drawing on the board sometime. Normal. They talk in class, but not to make a mess. It's because of the TV, they can't concentrate. Yeah, the TV, the TV.. This is something special. Sounds great. Just a drop. There's a cinema in front of the jail and a pub a bit further. Everytime I go see my son I want to enter into that pub. That's not just a drop! I want to enter there in order to talk with the bartender. Because I say to myself, when someone is freed, with no-one to expect him, who find himself alone, he'd surely come in this pub. So I would like to know how it goes. How does he behave, how does he talk, and behave with the other guy. Perhaps he'll take his gun and steal the money. Stupid! Even today I walked passed by that pub. But I didn't dare come in. Strange. You could tell him: "My son's coming out in 10 years, make sure the coffee's good that day!" You go first, I'll throw this away. My car's here, just where it's forbidden. Don't look inside, it's such a mess. It's because of Sylvie, Bernard's daughter. She'll be five soon, just when her mother leaves jail. Isn't that nice? Yes it is. I heard you're not doing too well? Mancheron told me. Are they hard on you? I don't know. For the last three years, it seems they are just fed up. Perhaps it's because of me. Perhaps it's not you nor them, but everything else. Since my son went to jail, I wonder about his daughter. And you know, you have to avoid staying still. It gets rusty fast in there. My car is further away, where it's allowed. Bye, Laurence. Thanks, Lucien. The hardest part is to listen, but the kids don't know that yet. Bye, Lucien. Give my greetings to Jean. Thanks. I want to kiss you, can I? I knew I shouldn't have. I knew it, damnit. I'm so stupid! Better jump in the Rhne than kiss me, right? No, that's silly. I even make her laugh. Damn it, shit! Just go home. I've got the TV left, at least! Hello, Cap'tain. You're back sooner than expected. I came back this evening. Your parents are doing well? Nice picture. Put it more to the left. Any coffee left? I don't know. Tell me, did you take my black pencil? I've lost it then. Good. If the idea was to break it, then it's a success. There's no coffee. And the day after tomorrow, school. It doesn't really show yet. But with a little red curtain, it would start to look nice. And of course that should be the prettiest red curtain. I was thinking about something. I should paint a nacked woman in bricks with very large, inexpressive eyes, standing up, her arms in the air. I'd paint an open door on her belly with a key on it, and behind the door, there'd be a newborn baby. I've got plenty of such ideas. I slept with a guy. You don't believe me? In truth, not really. Of course. What's going on now? You told me I wouldn't make it without the kids. It's awful to say such a thing. What do you know? You're all being funny, you, Anne. You're so scared that I'd give up. "Such a beautiful job!" You don't like the idea. It's as when beautiful lovers part ways. No one's thinking "perhaps she's right". No one! Of course: Laurence is having a bad time, we must take care of her, it will get better. I've got no right to go elsewhere. I can have dreams but not live them. You've got no imagination for me. But you're right since I'm going back. Listen, I didn't force you. Nevermind, forget it. I'll go take a walk. For long? I dunno. You're here? Yes, I wanted to apologize for the other night. You could've go upstairs. I didn't want to be a nuisance. I know what you feel. So I thought, she must'nt give up. They need you. It's not just Jean, but the others too. They need a teacher like you. I guess they only find me less ugly than the others. I'm helpless. No, that's not true. It's hard to say, see, the other day, someone said on TV, "you must do everyting to make life less heavy". He said that? That's a very generous grade. "You must to learn liberty. " I'd have given that an F. Just leave it. 4000 francs per month for all this. But as we said the other day, there are the holidays. Without them there would be 60% less teachers. You should hurry up, they wont wait for us all day. You had 8 days to make all this. I know. She always knows everyting. Even heroes have to it. I can smell that sandwich. Johnny Walker, Chivas Brothers, drink them dry. What's going on? Fuck! What are you doing? It's stuck. How did it get stuck? I threw their homework in it. I threw it in and it got stuck. You still haven't bought a screwdriver? We have this. No, you got it wrong. It ain't a screwdriver. I'll leave it to you. Here we are. I'll got home soon to wait for you. Bye. Another. Another still. How do you do? Hello madam. What about Philippe, he still talks spanish? Still. Are you better? You don't look good. They let you watch TV all day long again? Paul, you seem to have something interesting to say, why don't you tell it to all of us? Come on, Paul! Come here. No? Good. Before talking about your homework.. which is, in fact, not really great.. As anyone watched "Golden Helmet" on TV? It's the third time they broadcast it. So, what did you think? I thought it was awesome. Not bad. When she sees him comitting murder, I cried. Did you cry much? You shouldn't make fun of her, it made me cry too. All right, your homework now. The grades were abysmal so I decided to keep them. But, madam... Silence. Take out your books. Take your books. I believe that Moliere is pretty much always the same story. There's always something with money and a wedding in the end. I think Moliere must've liked money a lot, but he didn't have much. That's why he made small books, in order to make money. Always about money. It's not always about money! Well, I think, there's always something about it, even if only a little. And the audience of his plays is mainly poor people. Let him make his point. It attracts them to know fun will be made out of the rich. If we'd make fun of the poor, it would attract fewer people. Quite the contrary. Moliere entertained the nobles. Some of the whealthy weren't pleased with that and wanted to put him in jail. Because of his satires. I think all this thing with money is related to his times, cause it was very important then. I think that Moliere didn't agree with the important discrimination made between the poor and the rich. There was a big difference. The poor could die of hunger, no one would care. When a rich man died though, big fuss was made. Women were deemed inferior. It was up to the men to decide things. Women only obeyed. And Lucie? You've got nothing to say? Do you like "The Miser"? So you blend the gasoline with oil like this, three quarts to one, as shown on the board. The air filter here filters air. Don't tell me! So gasoline comes on the left, and there the air comes in? Yes, it blends together here. So it's air and gasoline blended together? This thing here opens this valve. When it's open, air enters this compartiment. Afterwards the valve is closed again. So when I push the accelerator, there's a call for gasoline. You're not doing it right! It must be funny to see you drive. They were so full of energy. It was amazing! One half of my heart is here, doctor, but the other is in China, with the army marching towards the yellow river. Every morning, doctor, at dawn, my heart is shot in Greece. And when prisonners fall in their sleep, when you hear footsteps leaving the infirmary, my heart goes away, doctor. In an old wooden house in Istanbul. It's been ten years, doctor, that I've got nothing to give to my people. Only an apple, a red apple, my heart. It's because of all this, doctor, not the arterioesclerosis, nor nicotine, nor jail, that it hurts in my chest. I watch the night through the window, and despite the walls that oppress my heart, it still beats with the furthest star. You change the channel? No way. I want to see something. I bet they're all watching this. Your pupils? You're not gonna watch this american trash just because your pupils do? Just say that you don't like opera. That's not true. Do tell me that you don't like it. Stop it. Come on, say it! Leave me! Say it, say it, say it! You piss me off. I piss you off? What the fuck! Shit! If the idea was to break a cup, then it's a success. You're not the same anymore. You used to be always happy. What's going on? It was my first day of work. School, school, always school. What about me? Yeah, I know. I wanted to buy you a dress. How was it? Green. With large squares. And long sleeves. You may not have liked it after all. I started smoking again. Can you spare a cigarette? Laurence, when you'll go back to school in september I wont be there. I give up everything. It's a bit because of you and your doubts that I got scared. Suddenly I couldn't bare the crowded class-room, the brutal program changes, the ongoing governmental reforms, transforming teachers into experimentators. The pupils as test-subjects. I've got no strength left to charm 120 children. Perhaps I never had it. I only see people giving up around me. I hope I'm not like them. I hope that leaving school doesn't compare with deserting. What are you going to do? I've got a job at FR3. I got it thanks to my father. You're preparing yourself for the coming year? Yes. I'm scared too. For 3 weeks already. In 8 days I'll be sick, perhaps I'll throw up. They, too, are scared. Less than us. I don't know. I've forgotten. And still, you go on. When I went to see my parents, my father surprised me. His gestures were so slow, so slow. And I though, "That's being old for him, being clumsy, slower, being in pain when he bows". For us, it'll be the incapacity to listen. In my hometown, women become old at 40. It's not just the body. It's just that one day they sit down, in the afternoon, they watch a tree, a little one, and burry their youth just like that, without rebellion. It's true, I hold up to the children. They laugh, they are violent, and they often hurt, but they help me to live. I'm accustomed to it now. I couldn't live without them. And I don't want.. You know, in a world of adults, and adults only, I'd be afraid. I need to be surprised. And the children.. I'm fond of them. What happened to the old woman you watched from your window? I don't know. One night she disappeared. She's perhaps moved off. I never saw anyone at her place. I never knew her name. She's afraid to die young of illness. She's afraid to sleep in the dark. He's afraid of injections and hospitals. He's afraid to go back to sleep and find his nightmare waiting for him in the night. There's nothing more troublesome than being timid. I'd like to know what people really think of me. She's afraid of the break of the war, because of the children she'll have. She's afraid of being scared during a horror film. She's afraid of waking up as a dead person. I dreamt I was a typewritter that didn't do spelling errors. I dreamt that my parents got reconcilied forever at the gala where I danced.
