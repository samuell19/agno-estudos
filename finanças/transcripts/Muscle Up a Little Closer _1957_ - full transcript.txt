[♪♪♪] ♪ Hello ♪ ♪ Hello ♪ ♪ Hello ♪ ALL: Hello. [♪♪♪] I'll make the salad as soon as the table's set. Okay. [KNOCKING ON DOOR] The boys. [GASPS] I'll ring the bell and we'll-- Don't bother ringing the bell. You know it's broken. It is? Yeah, it's been broken for a long time. What are you doin'? Aw, come on. Aw, come on. How do you like this bubble brain? He keeps picking his head-- Hey, hey! I'm sorry. Tiny, baby. Mary. Look what I got for you. Oh, you went to the barber. Oh, how nice you look. Let me look at you. I'm sorry we're late, honey. Yeah, we had to get that shipment of groceries out you girls sold to Adler and Company. Working at the same place sometimes does have its disadvantages. Kiss me, baby. Oh, Joe, get rid of that gum. Gee, Tiny, don't I always? There. Ah. I'm ready. Okay. Oh! Ha-ha! Oh, Joe, you forgot to ask me about the ring my grandmother willed me. Yeah, I-- I didn't forget. You told me you received it. You told me that it was a 5-carat diamond, and you told me that it was worth $5000. Show it to me. Okay. Come on, honey. Darling. Baby. ALL: Aw... [GASPS] My ring! It's gone! [SCREAMS] Don't yell! It's gone, my ring! What's the--? Her ring is gone! Aah! Not so loud! [SOBBING] The ring is gone! What's the matter? Her ring is gone! Were those windows pried open? No. No, I opened those. The one who took the ring must have a key to this house. But I only have one key to the house, and that was in my personal locker down at the plant. You told most everybody at the plant about the ring. I'll bet somebody took the key out of your purse, came here, stole the ring, and returned the key before you missed it. But how did they get into her locker? Hey, wait a minute. Elmo Drake, the trucking foreman. He's got a pass key to all the lockers. Hey, you know, I never did trust that guy. I think he's a crook. And so do I. Wait. We better search the place. It could've fallen under the bed. Let's look before we leap. Yeah. He's a good looker and not a bad leaper. MOE: Well, come on. JOE: Let's go, let's look. Larry, did you find it? LARRY: No. [SOBBING] Larry! JOE: No, that's Tiny. Come on. [LARRY GRUNTS] Hey, we forgot about Larry. Poor Larry. MARY: Oh, you poor thing. Oh, a truck hit me. Get me out of this trap. Okay, kid. Come on. We'll get you up. I'm mortified. You're all sprung. Yeah. [WHISTLING] Hey, Moe, that shipment came in from Japan. What was in it? Matzos. Oh, just in time for Thanksgiving. [CRASH] Joe, here's a rush order. Wrap it, and get it out fast. Okay, okay, okay. [WHISTLING] [GRUNTING] Get that case of matzos open. It's stuck. Well, put some muscle behind it. Ooh! Oh, I'm sorry, Moe. So am I. What is this? That's a-- [GROANING] Hold that. [WHIMPERS] [GASPS] Ooh, you scared me. You get rid of that gum. I won't, I won't! Okay. [CRUNCH] Ow! Ow! Oooh! Good for you. Good for you, you gum stealer. Get rid of that package. It's a rush package! You hear me? [BARKS] Ooh, he's mad. [HUMMING] What are you doing? You told me to hold it. Well, you can let go now. Oh, good. Oh! Oh! I'm sorry, Moe. Moe, Larry! Moe, Larry! I'm caught in a trap! Do something! Get me out of here! Okay, okay. Gee whiz! Okay, okay. Gosh. My goodness. Oh, I'm glad I'm out of that. Now you wrap that package, and do it right. Larry and I are gonna do a little snooping to try and find Tiny's ring. Yeah, do a little snooping for me too. Right. Okay. They're wonderful snoopers. They're... This is Elmo's locker. You look around the place carefully. See that there's nobody here. All right. What's the matter with you? I'll search his locker for the ring. You stand guard. Aye, aye, captain. Lieutenant. Shh. Nothing. Aha. Must be under one of these legs here. [CLANGING] [BIRDS CHIRPING] Ah, nothing. Hey, Larry, Larry. Fine guard. Nice time to go to sleep. Come on. Something knocked me dizzy. You were born that way. Listen, I didn't find a thing. We gotta get these keys back before he misses 'em. Come on. [WHISTLES] Come on. [SLAP] LARRY: Ow! I don't know where we can search now. There must be some-- [HUMMING] Hey, what's the idea of the burlap? That string is an octopus. It's all over. Get that finished, and get it out of the building, will you? Okay. Just gotta get a stamp, and off it goes. Well, stamp it and off it. Off it goes. It's following me! Well, hold still, and it won't follow you. Ooh. [GRUNTS] Oh, look what you did to my shirt, you! I'm so... You, you, you... [YELLS] Ugh! Listen, you. You get those eggs into the refrigerator right now! Hm. Go on! [GRUNTS] You almost made me knock these over. [GRUNTING] [CLANG] Oof! [CRASHING] [GRUNTS] Ooh, raw egg. I hate raw eggs. Ew. Larry, will you help me? Help him. He made the mess. Let him clean it up himself. Quit stallin'! I'm not stallin'. I'm thinkin'. Hey. [HUMMING] What is with this guy? [SCREAMS] Whoa! Doin' something. [HUMMING] A frustrated short-order cook. This guy must've come from outer space. Clean. Oh! Ooh! [WHIMPERING] Ow! Ow! Ow! [SCREAMING] I'm having a heart attack! I think I'm having a heart attack! Take it easy, Joe. Relax, come on. Sit down and relax here. Take it easy. We better get a doctor. We don't need a doctor. I was in the army medical corps. I saw you on TV. Be quiet. Get him a glass of water. Don't go away. I won't. Ooh, ooh, ooh. [CLEARS THROAT] I'm so sick. Here's the water. Don't touch me. I'm sterile. There we are. Say "ahh." Ahh. Say "it's a fraud." It's a fraaaud. Weak heart. Get a new one right away. Oh, take a mouthful of water, but don't swallow it. If you please. Now say "pink pill." Pink pill. Well, that's an involved case of high water pressure, but I'll test his heart anyway. Pardon me, doctor. [BLOWING AIR] [IRREGULAR POPPING SOUNDS] Must be a little dust in it. Where's the rag? Wait. I'll take care of that. [BLOWS AIR] Ow! Please. Doctor, is it serious? Slight case of musical cardiac, rock and roll type. Lot of fat around the heart and plenty of it around the head. Strenuous exercise is what I recommend. Good. At lunch, we can take him downstairs to the gym, and give him a workout. I thought we were gonna look for Tiny's ring. Ah, but we must take care of you first. Oh, you're my pals. Thank you. Now close your left eye. Tilt your head. [ELECTRICITY BUZZING] [GROANING] [BOTH SCREAMING] Hi, fellas. Hi, Tiny. Hey. Oof! Hey, what are you doing here? You're supposed to be looking for my ring. Well, we're gonna get to work later on it. Yeah, and I gotta take exercise because my musical cardiac is-- Oh, Joe, you're too fat. Look at your head. Oh, that has nothing to do with it. What you need is exercise. Yeah, take care of that. Oh, you tell him, Tiny. Yeah. Here's what you should do. [GRUNTING] [SIGHS] [PANTING] Come on, Joe. You do it. Yeah, well, I'll be seeing you. Joe, come on. Pick it up! Pick it up? I can't even bend. Oh, come on. I'll help you. Come on, Joe. What do I do? Get ready to grab it. Okay. Up, up we go. That's it. [BOTH GRUNTING] [GRUNTING] Wonderful! You don't know your own strength! Yeah! What are you-- What are you doing over there? Oh, no! [THUD] Moe! Larry! [TINY GASPS] JOE: Tiny! Oh, are you all right, honey? Okay, kid, get him up there. [BOTH GRUNT] Oh, Joe. Are you all right, honey? Hey, there's Elmo. Let's jump on him and search him. No, we'll follow him after work. Yeah. Keep an eye on him. I'll keep both eyes on him. Are you all right, honey? I'm all right. Don't worry, Tiny. Are you sure? Don't worry. Ha. Hey, fatso, you gotta build those muscles before you can lift that thing. Yeah? And wrestling's the way to do it. Hey, wait a minute. What are you doing? The headlock. Oh, he's hurting my Joe. Take it easy. See, when I put on pressure, I flex and stretch my muscles. You're stretching my skull. This'll make a man out of you. [ELMO GRUNTING] [BOING] Ouch! What's the idea? You're a crook! Oh, Joe. That crook. He made an imprint of Tiny's key in the soap and had a duplicate key made. Hey, now wait. You got it all wrong. Let me at him! No, Tiny. Wait a minute. Hold on. This is a man's job. Where will we find one? Quiet. Come on, you dirty crook, give me Tiny's ring, or I'll let you have it. I haven't got it. Oh, yes, you have! Oh, oh, oh! [GROANS] [CUCKOO TWEETS] Why, that dirty crook. Let me at him. Yeah, go get him. You asked for it, you crook. See that? It was a great fight, Ma, but I lost. [CUCKOO TWEETS] That does it. Let me at him. I'm so mad. Let me at him. Let go. Let go of me! Let go of me! I'll kill him! Let go of me! Ooh, she let go of me. You get him, Tiny. I'm afraid I'll kill him. [GROWLING] That's the stuff. That's the stuff, Tiny. I'll be right in back at you, and all the time I'll protect you. No, no, Tiny. No. Let him have it. Ooh! [BIRDS CHIRPING] [PANTING] [LOUD CRASH] [LOUD THUMPS] That'll take care of you, you crook. I found it! I found the ring! You found the ring! Yeah, I got it. Gee, now I won't have to buy you an engagement ring. When will you marry me? Now. Now. Now we can hock our ring and go on a nice honeymoon, doll face. [♪♪♪]
