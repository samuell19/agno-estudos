(inspirational music) (ominous music) (traffic passing) (banging) (shouting) - [Man] Don't let him get away, man! (suspenseful music) - [Man] Come on, come on, come on! (horn honking) (truck smashing) (speaking in foreign language) - Man, we messed up. (soft music) (phone ringing) (papers rustling) (books falling) - Speak to me. Patty, Patty, I have got a horrendous hangover. Company, what do you want? Who arrested her? Well then who called you and told you about it? Alright listen, I want you to get in touch with Rudy and tell him everything, okay? Alright, I'll meet you down there right away. Right away, I'll meet you. - You alright? - I feel like hell. - Where are you going? - My family has got some trouble with my sister. Well like my sister's daughter, my niece. She needs me. She's absolutely beautiful, Church. Who is she? Molly, Maggie, Mary, Madison? Come on, Churchill, what the heck was her name? Sara, Allie? Mandy, how are ya? Katelynn? Melissa? Karen? No. (birds chirping) Hey! Simple possession, half a gram of coke. No, let Rudy handle it. He's in there, leave him alone. - This is crazy, she's a baby. - Who's the guy she was with? Rudy tells me he's 28. - I don't know, Sam. She told me she was going to the mall with her friends and then a party in Montecito. - She's 16 years old, Patty. I'm 38, she's got more going on than I do. And how could you not know where your daughter is at night? - Please don't lecture me, Sam. Look, I've got a life too. I work five nights a week in that damn bar. I've got the right to some fun. - Having fun has never been one of your problems, has it? - Well look who's talking. - Listen to me, you've got a daughter who gets thrown out of school, she gets arrested for pot and now this? What's next? She gonna be out turning tricks on State Street? What's up with you? - I don't know what to do anymore, Sam. (sobbing) Can't you talk to her? - No. That doesn't work, remember? Alright, come here, I'll talk to her one more time but listen, you gotta remember, you are her Mom, alright? You're not just one of her girlfriends. She sees you entertaining the troops night after night, how can you expect anything different from her? I think they learn by example. Hey. - Church? - Yeah. - We gotta talk. - Can't it wait? I got something at home that really can't. Oh, what's the use, it's too late anyway. I need to call Burt? Yeah. - So what is it today? Save the whales or save the penguins? - No, that's the bluffs pipeline thing. It's important, Burt, leave 'em alone. - Okay, so Rudy got her released. - Yeah, to my custody, not Patty's. But she still has a chance to testify against that lowlife she was arrested with. - She got caught with the goodies, kid. It sounds like his big crime is contributing to the delinquency of a minor which the DA will bargain that down to zip. - You have not seen Stacy in a while, Burt. The only thing minor about her is her IQ. Jeez, would you give it a rest? Come on, Burt, I'm sitting here trying to get normal, you're pounding 'em down like it's Super Bowl Sunday. - It's the hair of the dog, Church, last night, whoa. Last night was rough, okay? - No! - Wow. - Alright. Guy with a liver concession at Cottage Hospital is gonna love you. - Bless him. (laughing) - So what do you say, pal? Patty's basically broke. Will you represent Stacy on the old installment plan? - I can do better than that. I got a phone call yesterday, some gal from out of town needs help tracking down her old man. Sounds like your basic runaway boyfriend case. So if it happens I'll do your legal plus pay you a few bucks. - Deal, I can sure use the money. - Well I wouldn't go on any spending spree, not just yet. - Burt, I haven't shaped a board in a month. Another week of this I'll be polishing boat bottoms and diving for dollars. - Sammy, I pleaded with you 20 years ago, take it to law school, you understood it. You could've gone on-- - City College I majored in fun. You taught an interesting class, counselor, but surfing was always easier than studying for me. - Here's to you, Church, living proof that old surfers never die. You just go searching for urchin and maybe a runaway boyfriend or two. (soft music) - So by the time I got back to my place she was already gone. - Bummer, bro. - Yeah, maybe I hallucinated the whole thing. I was so hung, I guess I can't drink tequila anymore. - Oh, it's okay, Church, you'll hook up again. (horn honking) Whoa, what's with the geez, dude? - Oh, might be a payday. Hey Burt. - Hey Sammy. - What's up? - You know the deal I mentioned? Looks like a go. I don't have all the details but it sounds very promising. - Great, what do you want me to do? - The basics, check the hotels. Call Rudy, see if the cops have anything. Maybe we'll give this girl some peace of mind, make a few bucks, everybody's happy. You gotta meet her at the pier, three PM, she'll be on the sundeck at Longwood's, okay? - Alright, I'll call ya. - Listen, Sammy, three PM, don't be late, okay! We're professionals! - Hey Church. What an outrageous blonde you left with last night, man. Bitchin' biscuit, definitely worth it. - Chelsea, another day, another T-shirt. Hey! I'm Sam, Sam Churchill. - You're also late, I believe we had a three o'clock. - Yeah, well low tide brought some pretty decent waves over to Hammond's, I guess I just lost track of time. Could I order you something, Miss-- - Laura Anders. And I'm not here to eat or drink, Mr. Churchill, I came to talk business and truthfully I'm very upset. - Yeah, about what? - You, the attorney that referred you, the police. Actually the entire town. I simply don't trust a place where people live because of the weather. - Oh, just where is it that you live, Miss Anders? - A real city, Chicago. - I understand the weather in Chicago is just lovely this time of year. Alright, so you don't wanna eat, you don't wanna drink. What do you say we take a walk, huh? - Well don't you have an office or something? - No, I'm, you might say in between offices at the moment. So we either talk here or we talk at my place and I got a feeling you would really hate my place. Alright Miss Anders, what are you doing here? - Didn't Mr. Geiger explain? My father's disappeared and I'm certain he's here in Santa Barbara. (laughing) What? - Burt thinks you're looking for an old boyfriend. - A boyfriend? - Yeah, you know, as in run off with another woman kind of boyfriend. - So I called Mr. Geiger's office number but the noise in the background sounded like a bar. No wonder he didn't understand me, he was probably drunk. - Look, would you let me save you some time and some money, alright? Miss Anders, call the police. They're equipped to handle missing persons, Burt and I aren't. - Listen, I already called the police, alright? The police don't give a damn about my father or anyone else without a permanent address. The homeless here are treated-- - Did you say homeless? - You're obviously not that experienced, are you, Mr. Churchill? I guess the attorney was confused about that too. - Well I'm not experienced when you're talking about finding some homeless guy if that's what you mean. Hey, listen to me. I'm Sam Churchill, not Sam Spade, alright? I shape surf boards, I paint boat bottoms, I dive for urchins. - Why are we talking? - Well, because occasionally I do some investigative stuff for Burt. I look for records, I take pictures. Alright look, the biggest thing I've done ever is repossess a motor home from some guy in Lompoc. (groaning) - Well at least you're honest. And more courteous than the police were. So I'll be honest with you. Mr. Geiger was last on the list, alright? I have no choice here. It's you or no one. - Alright look, Laura, why don't you tell me about your Dad. - Well, several years ago my mother died and it just devastated my father and he began drinking heavily. Just sitting in front of the TV all afternoon and I tried to get him out but I'm so busy with my work. Anyway, one afternoon we went to the park near Soldier Field and he met some men there, some vagrants actually and they began talking about their adventures on the road, their summers in California and their winters in Florida and the strangest thing happened as he listened. For the first time in months he came alive. I guess I shouldn't have been surprised when he decided to join them. - So you went along with it, huh? - Well we had an arrangement. See, once a month every month he'd call then I knew he was alright and I'd forward him some of his Social Security money. - Doesn't sound too bright. I wouldn't want a pocket full of cash if I was sleeping out on the streets. - My father's not an idiot, Mr. Churchill. Along with the others he worked for his meals, odd jobs, like what you do. - What do you think happened? - Well last month Dad didn't call. He had been in Los Angeles and was headed for Santa Barbara. In three years my Dad never missed a call, even if he was sick. - Well maybe he's still in LA, it's a big place. - Nope, I know he was here. See, this was dated two weeks ago. The man right there by the sign, that's my father Arthur Anders. Alright well, how about the police, what'd they say when you talked to them. - That there's nothing they can do which means there's nothing that they will do. - Hang on, a lot of the cops around here are friends of mine, they're good guys. - Oh come on, don't you understand? My father is doing this crazy thing and I'm responsible. I should've stopped him. Whether he's alive or, I've gotta know. - Alright, I'll do what I can but don't expect much. Looking for a vagrant in Santa Barbara. - Together we can find my father, I know it. - Together? No, no, no, listen, Burt and I, we take care of business. You just stay out of the way and pray that we get lucky, alright? - Don't be ridiculous. You've already told me that you're no investigator but you do know this area and I know my father. We'll work together. Now listen, tonight, I'm gonna drive around town. I've noticed areas where these men gather and you should go back to the police. Maybe they'll treat you more decently. - Listen, I-- - And then tomorrow we're gonna head out bright and early and get a move on this whole thing. Everything's gonna be great. I've got a good feeling about this. - Hey Rudy! - Museum of Natural History at 8:30 AM, not your style Church. No waves and no beach babes. - Listen, I ran into Jeb at Audrey's. He said you'd be up around to call. What's going on? - Break in. Somebody got into the chu-mash-berl relics. - Listen, I'm doing some snooping around for one of Burt's clients. Kind of a trade off sort of thing. Tell me what you know about a fella named Arthur Anders. - The missing vagrant. Other than the fact that his daughter's a pain in the butt, not much. - Yeah, well at the moment she happens to be my pain in the butt. You guys gonna do anything about his disappearance? - What disappearance? The young lady's working off a blurred photo in an out of town newspaper. Even if the old dude was in town he's probably moved on to greener pastures. - Get real, come on, this is Santa Barbara. For a bum it doesn't get any greener than this. - Politically incorrect, Church. So far this year four street people have been killed. We have no answers to those homicides and there we had bodies. If you have some ideas on how to track down the elusive Mr. Anders, let me hear about it. Right now, the SBPD ain't got a clue. - Thanks for your help. (soft music) Hi. - Where have you been? - Well, rim-con was happening so I surfed for a while. It was like blatantly unexpected. - This is your idea of an investigation? - Hey, I checked on some things this morning. Gee whiz. - Mr. Churchill, if you actually plan on helping me it's a full time job. I am paying for your services, you know, as ineffective as they may be. - Look, the financial arrangements are between you and Burt. - Listen, Peter Pan, my agreement with your boss is a day's work for a day's pay. Now what about my father? - Okay, one, I went down to the police station. As far as they're concerned you're just one major pain in the butt so you can forget about them being any help. It's kind of hard to drum up any sympathy for a homeless guy who wants to be homeless. And two, I went down to the news press and got you a much better picture than that crumbled up clipping you've been carrying around, thank you very much. And three, don't worry about it, I've got a plan. - Well I took a walk around town today, a very unique place. So many people don't seem to do anything but just hang out. - Well, it's not Chicago. - Yeah, more like a third world country, you fit in perfectly. Now what's your plan? - Well, tomorrow Burt's gonna check out every hospital, mental institution and morgue between LA and San Francisco. - Can he handle that? - Please, Burt can handle anything when he's sober. - Difficult to believe. - And I figured I'd go straight to the source, see if dear old Daddy did come here he's probably got a friend or two still around. - I'm going with you. - No, you're not. - Listen Sam, I've got to be involved, okay? You can't stop me. - You know what, I think that is an excellent idea. I really do. I think you need to see the kind of folks your old man was hanging with. It was dumb of him coming out here but I guess dumb kind of runs in your family, huh? (grunting) - I wish there was someone, anyone else in this horrible town that could help me. (train horn blowing) And by the way, this is a pathetic way for a grown man to live. (train bell dinging) - Gentlemen, I'm looking for this fella, I was wondering if you can help us out. No? Alright, thanks anyway. - [Laura] This is how my father lives? - This is Santa Barbara, they don't freeze to death in the winter. Looking for this fella here. Or get mugged just based on esteem, right? Sir, can you help us out? We're looking for this guy here, you seen him? - No, I haven't seen him at all. - Well if you do find me at that number. - [Vagrant] Okay, I'll do that. - Most folks in town try to help out those who want it but those boys over there, hardcore. - [Laura] Are they military veterans? - Well maybe a few of 'em. Here you are, sir. Looking for that guy. If you see him give us a call. For the most part a bottle of wine, spare change. Sure beats working. - These aren't the type of men my father left Chicago with. - No, but these are the type that are out there. The strong ones pray on the weak ones. You wanted to come along? Come on along. - I told the cop, chief of police in Fort Pierce, to screw himself. I told him just where to stick it. - Hey guys, I got some pictures I want you to look at. Jerkoff sent me, me, to Belgrad for 90. I did it too. Every damn day of it. (laughing) But on the way out of town. Left him something to remember. I grabbed me a local girl that was hitching to Miami. Only about 15 but I showed her how nasty. (laughing) - Alright, listen up. - Who the hell are you? - Looking for this man in the picture right there. Anybody gives us any information, we'll give you 20 bucks. - Beat it! 20 bucks, I don't care about 20 bucks! - Hey, hey come on! - Sam! - Knock it off! (punching) (grunting) Pay close attention to the picture, gentlemen. Anybody gives me the right information, there'll be a whole lot more than 20 bucks on the back end. Now listen to me, pigpen, this is your lucky day. I'm just a gentle soul on a mission of mercy. You understand me? - Yeah. - What? - Yes sir. - Good. - Hey, you didn't have to hurt that man. - Yes, I did. He'll get over it and then go on to Florida. She won't, she's 15 years old, just like my niece. - You didn't believe that story. - Absolutely I believe it. You better believe it too if you're serious about getting your father back. (tense music) AJ? AJ, come on, what are you doing back there? - Hey bro, how is it? - What's up? - Just hanging, come on back. - Hey guys. - Join us for some classic Miller Shore footage. There's a reel up for the pipeline with some dude named Sam Churchill doing some serious shredding. (upbeat music) - Actually I was hoping maybe you had some work for me. I'm tied to a gig at the moment but I'm thinking about bailing. - I'm dying here, man, no custom jobs in a month. And you shaped the last one. - I was afraid of that. - Yeah, but your man Burt's got an APB out on you. He called an hour ago, maybe he's got something. - Yeah, he's got something alright. (phone ringing) (soft music) - Burt Geiger, attorney at law. Hey Sammy, how you doing? Man, you sound a little uptight. - Yeah, well I am a little uptight. I'm burnt, Burt, this Laura Anders chick and I are not simpatico, you know what I mean? Half a day with her, I think I met every bum in Santa Barbara. I'm going fruit. - Look, you just gotta stick with it, kid. If nothing else, it's an invaluable lesson. You don't always like your clients in this business. Yeah, that's the deal. Alright it sound better, Sammy. Listen, I looked everywhere, nobody's heard of Arthur Anders. No hospitals, no morgues, na-da. Yeah, I got one thing more going. Buddy of mine up in Sacramento, he's checking the state computers for stiffs that match this guy's age and description. Yeah, just a day or two, maybe a little longer. - No, a day or two and no longer. Please, Burt, I'll call you. Who are ya? What do you want? - [Cory] Hey Church, Cory here. It's breaking at K-39, the Baja's happening. - Cory, you're breaking my heart, cut it out. - [Cory] Call me if you wanna go, see ya. - [Patty] Hi Sam, it's Patty. Listen, Stacy's acting up, she refused to stay home. She's in your custody, Sam, so can you call me or come over? Yeah, come over-- - You promised me you'd talk to her. - [Patty] You promised you'd talk to her, Sam. - [Man] I know about the guy in the picture but the money's gotta be right. Go to the dirt road next to the tracks on the far side of the bird pond. There's a bridge, make it 5:30 and be sure you're alone. (train rolling) - Sorry fellas, I'm a little short on bread myself at the moment. (suspenseful music) (crashing) (ominous music) (laughing) - What do you know? It lives! How's the head? It's Sam, right? He ain't saying much. But you gotta believe that his head feels like-- (grunting) You punk! (screaming) (flames crackling) - Ow, my leg! - Where is he? Where is he? Find him, find him! - Let's get! (tense music) - What the heck happened back there? - One half gallon of Shell unleaded. I heard them plotting after you left this morning. Figured you might be needing a hand. - Up and over, huh? - No need, cuz. As long as I've been around, ain't too many locks I can't pick. - What is your name? - Too Sweet. - Too Sweet? Anyway, I really appreciate what you did. Risked your life. Those friends of yours aren't exactly-- - Arthur was my friend, not that trash. And you trying to find him. - Wait a minute. Too Sweet, are you telling me that you know Arthur Anders? - We was traveling companions and I owe him. He helped me out more than one time, I'm telling you. Gave me this coat. Bought me medicine in San Diego when I was near dead. He's a good man. - Where is he? - Damned if I know. Come here, come here! I don't think he seen us. - Tell me about Arthur Anders. - We was out at the polo field. - What were you doing at the polo field? - Every year when I drive up through this area, I pick up some running money shoveling mess from the stables. I know this fella that do the hiring. It's Mexicans mostly but it's got so even the wetbacks ain't willing to stand knee deep in horse crap. - Tell me about Arthur Anders. - One day Juan had something special for Arthur, work to do at some rich folk's place. - Who is Juan? - That's who we talking about, cousin. He the man out there. Juan Ochoa. They call him Johnny A and that bad boy is making the long dollar. He running errands for the members. Transports illegals up from Mexicali. - But I understand Arthur had his own money so why would he need to work? - Can't say for certain. Arthur is a funny one. It ain't like he's really one of us but he always want to do what we do. - Well if I need to talk to you again where can I find you? - With Yancy and them on my trail, and they will be-- (grunting) - You can run but you ain't gonna hide. (punching) (tense music) (shovel smashing) (shovel clanging) - Too Sweet, Too Sweet, you alright? - I've been better, cuz. - Call an ambulance! Call the police, now! (engine revving) (tires screeching) - Sam, Stacy didn't come home last night. - Patty, I didn't come home last night. - My God, you're bleeding. - How you can stay out till all hours when you're employed to find my father is just beyond me, Sam. Oh, you're bleeding. - Yes, I know, I'm bleeding. Now please, all of you, go away, leave me, leave me alone now. - But Sam-- - Patty! If it can't wait talk to Burt, he's at the Wildcat. And you, meet me back here at two o'clock. No, three o'clock sharp. - I just-- - Go! (soft music) Unreal. - I've been wrong about you, Sam. I'm sorry. - Hey, forget about it. We're onto something now and that's all that really matters. - So, Yancy didn't hurt my father? - Too Sweet doesn't think so. So until we learn something different we'll just have to keep believing that your father is alive and well. Well, alive anyway. - Well that's encouraging. Kind of. Now what? - Now we ask questions. Hey buddy, you know Juan Ochoa? - No. - Juan Ochoa, Johnny A? - No, no. - No. - No. - Senor, Juan Ochoa? Senor, (speaking in foreign language) Juan Ochoa? Senor, (speaking in foreign language) Juan Ochoa? - Oh, come on, somebody here has got to speak English. - No, not to us they don't. - Hey, Sam, this guy. (speaking in foreign language) - I hab-la just fine, thanks. What can I do for you? - We're looking for a guy named Juan Ochoa. Can you help us out? - The boss man? - Boss man. Yeah, is he around here somewhere? - I haven't seen him. And don't bother asking the com-pas-inos. - Actually, it's someone that Ochoa hired. He's an older man. - I mind my own business, Miss. And I give you the same advice. - Please, it's my father we're after. - Try the Copacabana. It's a bar in town. - Yeah, on Milpas, I know the place. - He's usually there, center court. (speaking in foreign language) Considers himself quite a pool player. - Thank you. - I've done you no favors, Senorita. Watch yourself around Johnny A. (billiard balls cracking) (Latino music) (laughing) (speaking in foreign language) (bell ringing) - Ah, the congenial atmosphere of the Copa. - I felt more welcome at the stables. - Senor. (speaking in foreign language) - You play pool? - Well-- - Guy in the suit, he's our man. All right, now that we've passed the first test, what do you say we mingle? - What's the matter, amigo? Don't you cheer for a winner? - Well, it kind of looks to me like you're playing with yourself, amigo. I don't see how you can lose. - That sounds like a challenge. Friendly contest, say 20 dollars? - No, thanks, I just came for a beer. - Oh, come on, Sam, play him. - For the honor of this beautiful senorita. - Well, in that case, we'll play partners. - No, I don't think so, maybe some other time. - Well, senorita, you and your partner could not play against (speaking in foreign language) and there don't seem to be no other ladies, but wait, Migilito! The na-no will be my partner. (laughing) (cheering) - Yes! - Just don't leave him a shot. - Who are you, Willie Mosconi? (ominous music) - Where did you learn to shoot shape like that? - Midwest girls know how to shoot pool. - Chica, I'm talking to you. What are you, some kind of pool hustler? No way I'm paying you 20 bucks. - Listen, we don't want your money, Johnny. We just want some information. - Oh, you know me? I don't know you. How you know me? - Come on, Johnny A, Juan Ochoa? Everybody knows who you are. - Where you think you are, asshole? Some white bread sports bar in Ventura? Look around, man. Mess with me, you won't get out of here alive. - Where's Arthur Anders? - White haired guy in his 70s, does odd jobs over at the Polo Field. - I don't know who you're talking about. I hire a lot of the old winos for that stuff. He sounds like most of them. You gotta let me go! - Listen, you can talk to me or you can talk to them, you got a choice. - I got no knowledge of this guy. But I'll look into the matter. Maybe he was out there, I hire so many. Meet me on the Polo Field tomorrow, three o'clock and come alone, or you get na-da. - Alright, that's good. - Mm-kay. - Don't forget. Meet you back here in one hour. I want to get to the shop and pick up my car before it closes. - Okay, but don't you think I should go with you? - No, I don't. - All right. But hey, you be careful. - I'll be careful. Now go on, go on. - All right. (dramatic music) (horses neighing) - Holy cow! (smacking) Come on! No. (horn honking) I'm coming! - Sam! Come on! These men were trying to kill you! - No, Ochoa was trying to kill me, which means we're on to something and (speaking in foreign language) is running scared big time. (phone ringing) - [Sam] Sam Churchill here, what do you want? - [Burt] Morning, Sammy. - [Sam] Oh, hey, Burt, what's going on? - [Burt] I got something, your friend Ochoa? - [Sam] Yeah? - [Burt] Remember that little guy Marty? - [Sam] Not the guy that sells phony designer jeans in supermarket parking lots? - [Burt] The very same. - [Sam] Oh, come on, Burt. He's the sleaziest character you ever defended. - [Burt] Thank you. Anyway, he says he knows Ochoa, and has done business with him. - [Sam] Now, there's a surprise. I can believe that. - [Burt] Look, I set up a meeting for three o'clock. - [Sam] Where? - [Burt] 718 Sycamore. It's a long driveway, you'll see my car at the end. - [Sam] Sycamore? What's the little chiseler doing in the high rent district? - [Burt] Selling real estate. Can you imagine buying a house from him? - [Sam] You got to be kidding me. I hope the owners nailed the furniture to the floor. - [Burt] Marty's a hustler, Sammy, and hustlers hustle. See you at three. - [Sam] Three o'clock, I'll be there. - It was a done deal. One of my guys checked out the merchandise, said it looked good. Thought I could turn a couple of bucks on the stuff, so I gave it a go, should've known better. - Marty was arrested. - It was some kind of sting operation. Copped a plea, Burt got me a reduced sentence. It was the start of a beautiful relationship. - So why are you helping me out with Ochoa, Marty? Seems a little out of character. - It's a barter deal, isn't it? Counselor said you need information, I need the counselor. - Marty got into trouble in L.A. He goes to court next week. - Not guilty. Let them try and prove I knew those shoes were not Reebok originals. - Marty says Ochoa has an office on the east side. - It's in a trailer behind a warehouse. It's off of South Sa-pue-des. I was there once, picked up a shipment out front. - Picked up a shipment of what? - Love films. Quality stuff from Mexico. - Right, right. - I found the material to be socially redeeming. - I believe the D.A. called it pornography. - The man's a Phil-is-tine. - Will you take me to see Ochoa, Marty? - That's sticking my neck out. - You know, Marty, that situation in L.A., I don't know. I mean, I have to burn a lot of favors to keep you out of County through appeal. Oh, what a hassle. - All right, look. I'll meet you at the corner of Garden and Haley at nine o'clock. We'll go from there. We'll take your car. I don't want to be seen in that scumbag neighborhood where anybody can recognize me. - What, are you afraid of Ochoa, Marty? - No, bonehead, I do business with these people, I don't want them thinking I'm ratting out a local. You don't crap where you eat, pal. Showtime. Hi! You found the place! Wonderful. (ominous music) - Nice place. - Take a look around, pal. It's not exactly Santa Barbara beautiful. - Sam, maybe this isn't such a good idea. (banging) - Quiet, quiet! The wrong people see us here, we're in big trouble! - Well, I just fell down. - Why is she here? (door creaking) - [Sam] There's got to be a light switch in here somewhere. - [Burt] Oh my God. - This is horrible. - See anybody you know? Hey, hey! - It's done now! - Sam, look at this. - [Sam] Prescription drugs. - Hey, I had nothing to do with the pharmaceuticals. Love movies, that's it. - Sam, there's a lot of gasoline containers with a bunch of fuses. - Pipe bombs. - Gasoline? - Arson, sweetheart. Pills, porno. The guy is a real renaissance man. - Hey, Burt, take a look at this. - These phone numbers are all in Mexico. - Wait a minute, here's a 969 prefix. That's Montecito, right? - Yeah. - Brander, that name mean anything to you, Brander? - Dr. Franklin Brander? - That's the LNG Pipeline property guy, right? I wonder if he's got a membership at The Polo Club. - No, wait a minute, Sammy, you are reaching here. This guy is old money and plenty of it. Please, the consortium is about to pay him, what, 26 million for his land. Guys like that don't get involved in this. - Look, look, if Ochoa's getting him something, he's getting him a gardener, he's getting him maids, he's getting him something. If his name is in the book, then there's got to be a connection. - How about stopping all the chit-chat, huh, before somebody shows up? - Wait a minute, I smell something burning, - Gasoline. (intense music) (chattering) (banging) (shouting) (exploding) - We might have been killed! - You wanted to come along, right? Come on! - Eats lunch here, almost every week. A moment of serenity in an increasingly violent world. - What's up with Ochoa? - He's been a very lucky guy. Five arrests, no convictions. He's the reason people want to close the borders. - But those horrible pictures. - Other than Marty, there's no way we can connect anything to Ochoa. - Not exactly what I call a reliable witness. - He's what I call a career criminal. So would the grand jury. - So you still refuse to help? - When we catch up with Ochoa, your father will be the first topic of conversation, I promise. Until then, there's nothing we can do. - Good, good. Thank you, Rudy, thanks a lot. I'll call you later. - Adios, amigo. - That man infuriates me! I mean, his attitude is so-- - I've known Rudy for a long time, he's a good cop! - Well, then why didn't you tell him about the name in the book? - Because if he gets involved, then it has to be official and I want to get to Brander, but not with all the baggage that comes along with a police visit, all right? - Will they see you? - Well, Burt's got this friend who does some legal work for the family. He's trying to set up a meeting for me. - Why don't-- - No. I'll get maybe five minutes with this guy and I don't want to press my luck. There is something you can do for me though. - What? - Have a girl to girl talk with my niece Stacy. - Oh, about her all night parties and her drug dealer boyfriend? - Uh-huh. - I don't think so. - Hey, Sam. - Burt. - Meet Tully Corso. Tully, this is my associate, Sam Churchill. - Good to meet you, Sam. - What can I get you? - Nothing, thanks. - Fair enough. Claire, one more, for me. Tully set a meeting this afternoon up at the Branders for you. - Great. - Let me warn you out front, Sam. Word is Dr. Brander is very ill. Hard to believe, because I just played 18 holes with the old pirate two months ago, he was driving the ball 180 yards off the tee. Probably the pressure from that pipeline deal has got him down. He's had several business problems these last couple of years. Lost a fortune on a medical start-up company. - What time do I get to meet the doctor? - I'm sorry, Sam, I thought you understood. Dr. Brander isn't seeing anyone. Sounds like he wouldn't even make the hearings unless his presence was absolutely required to finalize the sale. I got you a few minutes with Mrs. Brander. The lady's alright, a little different, she and that son of hers. But very gracious. - Good afternoon, sir. - Hi, Sam Churchill, I have a meeting with Mrs. Brander. - Identification please. - You guys expecting some kind of invasion or what? - Thank you, sir, I'll accompany you in. - Fine. (tense music) (whistling) - [Guard] This way, sir. - Hey, is that Dr. Brander? - Follow me please. (gentle piano music) - Mrs. Brander? I'm Sam Churchill. - Hello, Mr. Churchill. - Hi, I appreciate you seeing me especially on such short notice. - The afternoon opened up. Mr. Corso's call came at a propitious moment. Please, sit. My son Randall's work. - It's very unique. - Randall is an original talent. Misunderstood, as creative people often are. - I'll bet. I was very sorry to hear about your husband's illness. Mr. Corso said-- - I'm not concerned with my husband's illness, Mr. Churchill. Tully Corso shouldn't be either. He'll get his damn fee. - Oh, yeah, I'm sure that he will but that's not what I meant. - I know what you meant. You were being courteous, which was nice, but unnecessary. It's commonly known that I loathe my husband. We haven't been in the same room for two years. We've spoken only through attorneys for three years. We haven't slept together for five. He hates me and he hates my son. We would have divorced years ago but neither of us was willing to give up this house or what money there is left. If there is a God in heaven, he will make my husband's current illness fatal the minute the pipeline property has sold. Now, why are you here? - I understand that you, your family, is a member of The Polo Club? - I haven't been to a match in years. Randy goes occasionally, I believe. - There's a man that does odd jobs for some of the members at the club. His name is Juan Ochoa, do you know him? - [Mrs. Brander] No. - He may be a broker for your hired help. Maids, servants here, a gardener, groundskeepers. - We have nothing to do with him. - Hello, Randall. Mr. Churchill, this is my son. - Mr. Ochoa has been employed by numerous members at the club, finding them barn help and grooms and whatnot. But no more. - Well, maybe he's branched out. - We wouldn't know. Mother, why is this man here? - Because Juan Ochoa may be responsible for the disappearance of someone I've been hired to find. - There are hundreds of members at the club. Why are you bothering us? - Because your unlisted telephone number was found in Juan Ochoa's record books. - If the number is unlisted, how do you know it's ours? - Because I called the telephone number and your maid answered the phone. - I want you out of here. You're annoying me, and you're disturbing my mother! - If that's true, then listen, I'm sorry, but I have to-- - Mr. Churchill. Even though this really isn't any of your business, my stepfather is gravely ill. We're involved in a number of litigations, these ridiculous hearings which have put the family under a considerable amount of stress. So won't you please do us the courtesy of leaving now. Unless you'd rather I call security. - No, thank you. Thank you for your time. - [Laura] Well, what about the Branders? - They have the house set up like a fortress and they have rent-a-cops everywhere. - Why? - I don't know. The Branders are rich, eccentric people. They can afford to be left alone. That's not all that unusual in Montecito. - But Sam-- - I'm sorry. - Ochoa had their phone number. - Ochoa had a lot of phone numbers. I think Burt was right. I'm really-- (tires screeching) (screaming) (intense music) - Now, I don't want to hurt you, so sit back, relax, enjoy the ride. - Who are you? - Where are you taking us? - To see a fella, just to talk. (dramatic music) - How do you do? - I've done better. - I hope you weren't too inconvenienced by our invitation. - Who are you? - Nathan is the name. Welcome to our camp. - Why have you kidnapped us? - My way of being cautious, my dear. More on that later. Right now, we'll walk and I'll explain. Isn't that spectacular? - All right, I've had enough. What do you want with us? - I apologize, but it was imperative that we talk. - A phone call would've gotten my attention. - You're right. That would have been the civilized way to do things. But a number of people would like to see me incarcerated. I just need to know where you stood on that issue. - Okay, who are you? - I'm the leader of this ragtag outfit. Earthkeep we call ourselves. Folks back at the camp are members of the local chapter. - I read about you. He's the environmental terrorist. - According to Time Magazine. I've got nothing against spiking the trees in the forest or putting sugar in the tank of an earth-mover. That's eco-defense. And if we don't do it, who's gonna? - Well, how about The Sierra Club? - Now, they're good people. Often as not, they get used by the same system they're trying to change. - Well, that's all really great, Nathan, but what's that got to do with us? - What's going on with you and Dr. Brander? - Nothing, I haven't even met the guy. - Yeah well, I bet the two of you will appreciate the beauty of this point as much as do. - Wait a minute. Wait a minute, this is Brander's property, isn't it? Where the LNG refinery is supposed to go. You know, I surfed right off this point once. - Then you understand it's value. - Yeah, 26 million and change according to the paper this morning. - So, this land is priceless. Once they grade away the hills, dam up the creek, cut down the trees, that's all she wrote. You see, Brander knew that. He committed the property to a conservancy. - Wait a minute, if Brander is on your side, I don't understand, what's your problem? - Well, I was hoping you might shed some light on that subject. The last time we tried to contact him, we got run off by a bunch of armed guards so we followed the stepson, and the fellow he runs with. Doc didn't trust that boy. He trusted Ochoa even less. - Ochoa? - Ian was following his sidekick when he saw you folks at the trailer. And when you drove out to the estate and actually got in he figured it was time we talked. - Nathan, I'm afraid you've wasted a lot of time here. I don't have any interest in Brander or his property. I'm after Ochoa, but it's for an entirely different reason. - Look, I need your help, and maybe you could use ours. I want you to go back out to the estate and talk to Doc Brander for me. - I don't think I'm very welcome there, but sure, if it happens, I'll see what I can do. - Stakes are high here. This is a fight we're planning to win. I'm going to give you the number of one of our people in town. If you need our help, we'll be there. (laughing) - Hey, hey. - Easy, easy big guy. Shh. - Shh, come on. - Hi, Mom, we were just leaving, I left you a note. - Oh yeah? And what did it say? - It said that we were going to a party. - Oh, with your Montecito friends. - What is wrong with that? - It's after midnight, Stacy. - So? - You are going nowhere except to bed. Your own! - It's no big deal. We'll be back in an hour or so. - Hey, babe, let her have her fun. She's a big girl. - No, she's 16 years old! - Come on, I've had it with this. - Stacy-- - Hey, lighten up, honey. You invited me over for a drink, remember? - One hour, Stacy. That's it! What are you doing? - Nothing. - Get out of there! Get out of-- - Shut up! - No, you leave my things alone. Get out, get out of here! (slapping) (crying) (dramatic music) Stacy! (door shutting) Sam, she's gone! Stacy's with that guy! - [Sam] Rudy, hey! Yeah, I know. Listen, I wouldn't call if it wasn't real important. Yeah, I'm sorry. Look, I need to the address of the guy who was arrested with Stacy. Yes, now! Get it, please, now! (tense music) (knocking) - Private party, pal. - Yeah, well, I was looking for. What are you doing with my niece, pal? - Beat it, clown. (punching) - Stacy! - What the hell is going on in here? This va-to has got more lives than a cat! Randy, Randy, Randy! I got to talk to you. - Brander? - Do something. - I've had enough. Mess with me, man, I cut her throat. - You cut her throat and I'll kill you! - Leave the videotapes! - My camera. - Forget the camera! - Ochoa, how do you get this door open? - Press the button, stupid. - I just need the one-- - Shut up! Okay, hero. She's all yours! Used goods. (laughing) (tires screeching) - It's all right. It's all right. It's okay. (banging) (buzzing) (curtain tearing) (tapes breaking) (jazzy music) - Sam, listen, I know I've been critical but it really is time to bring in the police. - No. Not if Stacy would have to get involved and she can't handle that right now and neither could Patty. - The trail comes back here to Ochoa. The cops blow it, Ochoa goes to Mexico, that's the end of it. - I've got to get back on the grounds of the estate. Ochoa's there with Randy, I just know it. - Oh, good luck with that one. - I just need some help, that's all, Burt. - Well, what about Nathan? - If he can distract the rent-a-cops long enough for me to get onto the grounds and into the estate-- - Us, get us onto the grounds. - Forget it. - No, wait a minute, there's something going. Listen to me, you said the house was big. If we all go in together, we can pull-- - It's too dangerous, Burt. Now, this guy has tried to kill me three times already, I'm not dragging her into this. - Listen, we come along or I'll call Rudy. - That's extortion. - Oh, come on, Sam. Somebody's got to look after you. I mean, you're accident prone. - All right, all right. But you've got to do what I tell you, both of you. Laura, you can start by getting Nathan on the phone. Burt, I want you to call Tully and see if he can get me any information he can find on the estate, the grounds, the house, something. - And what about you, kid? - Well, I hear Hammonds is breaking, I'm going to go surfing. (suspenseful music) (gun shooting) - Jack, what the hell was that? - [Jack] Maybe gas. - You call the fire department? - [Jack] They're sending someone up there. Keep your eyes open. - Right. (gate creaking) - Hey, put that away or you're out of here. - I'm just having a sip for courage, sort of like the last blast before the charge-- - Pocket. - God. - [Guard] Well? - It was some kind of bomb. They left these behind, some tree hugger crap about the pipeline. - They may still be here. If they are, I want them found. And if they're found, I want them hurt! - Yes, sir. - Hey, put it away. - Sam! - Every little thing that happens ain't because of Sam Churchill. - I have had it, Ochoa! Mother and I should just leave until this whole thing blows over! - Quit sniveling, you sound like a little sissy boy. You ain't going nowhere until this deal is done. Don't blow it, Randy. We're too close. Come on and shut up. - Fine! - Too close to what? - I don't know, but I'm going to go find out. - No, listen to me, these guys are playing hardball. We'll leave now, it's simple trespassing, okay? We call Rudy, we tell him we found Ochoa and that's the end of it. You go into that house, that's breaking and entering. You are fair game, they can legally shoot you. - Burt, something is going on around here and Ochoa's right in the middle of it. Now, come on, we, all right, do you have your cell phone? - Yeah. - Keep your eyes and your ears open. If anything goes wrong, then you call Rudy. - I don't like this, Sammy. - Stay here, come on. Didn't I tell you it was cozy? It's Mrs. Brander. She won't give us any trouble. You look down here, I'm going to go on upstairs. - Okay, what am I looking for? - Something to do with Ochoa, I guess. I don't know, I'm not a detective, just be careful. - Okay. (banging) - [Dixon] This is Dixon. I just heard something in the living room. - [Morton] Morton here. I found a bunch of leaflets by the pool house. - How come you don't have a label? (door creaking) - [Guard] Captain, there's something at the garage. Tracks in the mud. Wait, I see them. There's three of them! - [Captain] All right, everybody to the garage on the double. - [Dixon] This is Dixon, 10-four, I'm on my way. - Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't realize you were, I mean, you're Dr. Brander. Sir, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to bother you but there's someone following me. And of course, we shouldn't be here, in the house I mean, but there are guards everywhere and your stepson is with that horrible Ochoa. And see, I've been searching for my father and he's been missing for. Father? - Laura. - Oh, I knew you were alive. Oh, what have they done to you? - Drugs. - Oh, Daddy. - Get help. - Listen, Sam's here, okay? I'll explain later. But we're all going to get out together, okay? (knife slamming) - Here's Johnny! Sounds kind of corny, but I always wanted to say that to someone to scare the hell out of them like Jack in that Shining thing. Hey, Grandma, what's up with the old dude? He's mine. I found him and I'm keeping him. Okey dokey? - Sam! Sam! - Laura? Laura? Laura! - Hero! Have a nice trip? (laughing) - You couldn't leave us alone. - I'm going to kill you, you little weasel! - That's how heroes are heroic, man. Always sticking their nose in someone's business. Let's go. - Sam! - Laura, are you all right? - Sam, this is my father. - Dr. Brander? No, Sam, this is my father. They've been holding him here prisoner. - Let's just call him a reasonable facsimile. Amigos, this one is slick. Hold him tight. - Where is Dr. Brander? - Traffic fatality. You know how unsafe the roads can be. - Ochoa! - You killed Dr. Brander? - No, man, that we do to you and the pool hustler. He forgot to look both ways before crossing the street. - Don't even mention that here. - Oh, po-co squeamish, this one. Not me though, I ain't nearly so sensitive. - Wait a minute, you killed Dr. Brander and you replaced him with Arthur Anders? - The old man was in the wrong place at the right time for us. He ain't no twin brother. - Hey! - But he'll do. - But why? - The property, chica. The old man was going to give it all away. - To Nathan. - Right. - We tried talking some sense into him but he wouldn't listen. He had to be alive to sign the papers because if they look at his will they see that Randy boy and his Mama were finished. - But you already have so much money. - No, not if Dr. Brander's poor investments make any difference. Mining leases, futures trading, real estate. Dr. Brander's been losing money big time for years. - Ooh, right again, John Wayne. - What about the porno operation, Ochoa? Was that just lunch money until the refinery deal came through? - Chump change. But I had the connections and Randy's a very talented boy. Besides, chi-qui-tas, they were fine. (laughing) - No, Sam, come on! - Okay, amigos, it's time! Take them down to the wine cellar and may I suggest a cabernet. It goes real good with a bullet. - Dad, Dad, it's okay. I'm gonna be right back, Dad. - You can't kill them in this house. - Shut up! Go to your Mama while I handle the dirt like always. - Sam? - What the hell? - Burt, get out of here! (gun shooting) (screaming) - No more killing. - You did this! You did this to me! I've got nothing without this pig, nothing! - Drop it, Ochoa. (speaking in foreign language) - Burt? Oh, Burt, what were you thinking? - He even bleeds booze. - I had to call Rudy, kid. I couldn't stand the waiting. - Don't try to talk. We'll get you to a hospital. - He shot me. - Rudy, call an ambulance! - We're gonna check you. - Oh, that is a sign, Sammy. That's it, I swear to God, I'm over with that. - If I'd have known that all it took was a bullet, I'd have shot you years ago. (sirens chirping) (chattering) (soft music) Can you believe they almost got away with this? - They had a lot of people fooled. - Hang in there, you old pirate. There goes a good friend. - So am I, Church. That's why I'm going to tell you how damn stupid you are. You should have told me the truth about all this. - You're right, I'm sorry. I don't know how you do it. I take this stuff too personal. I guess that's why I wouldn't make a good cop or a good lawyer. - But you did get your man. - Yeah, I did, didn't I? Yeah. (sighing) - Sam! - Hey! I know, I know, I'm sorry, I'm late. - Let me guess, the waves. - Yeah, at Stanley's, consistent three and four. - What's up with the suit and tie, huh? - Oh, I save this for special occasions. Real special. Last time I wore it was my high school graduation. - Well, you look sharp. - Thanks. Hey, speaking of wardrobe, you're looking pretty sharp yourself. - Oh, yeah, totally Santa Barbara. You know, at least until I get back to the real world. - Listen, do you really have to go back now? I mean, come on, another week in Santa Barbara won't kill you. I know a place you could stay. - Responsibilities, Sam. I've got a cat, an apartment, a career. - Yeah. - But thanks for the offer. I mean, I do have vacations, and now that I'm tight with one of the locals. - [Announcer] 203 to Denver and Chicago now boarding at gate three. Flight 203 to Denver and Chicago now boarding at gate three. (kissing) - Bye Sam. I'll miss you. - Yeah, me too. - Hi, Sam! Nice suit. - Hey, wait! Look, hang on a second! Next time you're in Chicago, why don't you wear this, huh? See you. Ellie? What is her name? Hey, what's your hurry, come on! Hey, hey, whoa, hold on, hold the phone!
