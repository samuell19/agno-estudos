of a place does dr weldon have it was used as a private insane asylum until the doctor disappeared disappeared yes don't you remember that they found the body of a murdered girl in his yard oh is that the place even that doesn't explain why this man should break into my house in this manner well you see he had rather a personal reason for wanting to scoop this story a personal reason yes well he's been secretly engaged to your daughter engaged to roof yes fact matter is i rather unwittingly aided their romance why should you do that because i wanted to see ruth happy even though i'd hope someday to be able to make her my way sam that wasn't to hurt my feelings a bit dick are you sure this is the right place oh what's the matter why something touched me what are you doing here just
