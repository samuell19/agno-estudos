THE 90th BIRTHDAY or DINNER FOR ONE Dear audience, ladies and gentlemen. We are located on the country estate of Miss Sophie. For privacy reasons, the first name of this ancient race is not reported. Miss Sophie has invited her four best friends to a birthday dinner. And this is the seating arrangement. Miss Sophie will sit over there, here will be Sir Toby, here Admiral von Schneider, There Mr. Pommeroy and over there Mr. Winterbottom. But there is a little difficulty: Miss Sophie is not the youngest lady. Today she celebrates her 90th birthday... and she outlived her best friends a long time ago. She has buried her last friend 25 years ago. Nevertheless, Miss Sophie would not renounce her birthday dinner. And because the gentlemen, for understandable reasons, cannot personally attend the dinner, they'll be represented by Miss Sophie's butler James. All the years that worked well and it will work again today. The procedure for this dinner has not changed for years. James will keep asking: "Same procedure as last year?" In german: "Die gleiche Prozedur wie im letzten Jahr?" And Miss Sophie will reply: "Same procedure as every year." In german: "Die gleiche Prozedur wie in jedem Jahr." With an emphasis on "every year". The ongoing conversation between Miss Sophie and her butler James is rather not interesting. So you won't have a hard time to follow the dialog of the most unusual birthday dinner, that has ever existed. Ladies and gentlemen, I hope you'll enjoy this dinner. And here is James... - Good evening, Miss Sophie, good evening. - Good evening, James. You're looking very well this evening, Miss Sophie. Well, I am feeling very much better.
