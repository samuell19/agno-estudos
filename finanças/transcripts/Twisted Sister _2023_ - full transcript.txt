When my parents were alive I was always doing what was expected of me. And then, with the marriage and then the baby, my whole world became about that. And then when my parents passed I was expected to run the business all on my own. And it's not that I didn't wanna do any of those things, I love being a wife, and I love being a mother, and being able to run the business. It felt like there was always something missing, something that wasn't right. And I ignored it. And I ignored it. And then I found out everything that you hid from me, and I had done so much for our family, and this is how I was treated in return. It, it was unfair. Emily, that is great. You are opening up, you're really opening up. That's exactly what these sessions are for, so you and Kyle have a safe space to talk. How's it make you feel to hear Emily say those things? She feels like our marriage was a mistake. That's not what I'm saying. Let's talk about how we are feeling and not assign feelings to someone else. Is there a way that you can say that to Emily? Another way? When I hear you say that, I interpret it to mean that you wish you made different choices, about me, about us. I don't regret our life together. I just, I want things to go back to the way they were. It's hard not to get stuck in the past, but how can we use what we know now to improve in the future? I mean, for me, I think it starts with honesty. I can promise that. Sometimes certain decisions are precipitated by how we might feel at the moment. It's important that you express to Emily things you want her to improve upon as well. Okay. I just never felt good enough for you. Is that... I mean, I-I remember the first time that I ever saw you and I thought, "That is my dream girl." But I also thought, "I'm never gonna get a girl like that." And then you looked at me and you smiled and. Do you remember? Well, we just, we started talking and I, I'd never felt that way before. But if I'm being honest, from that moment, I- I was scared that I was gonna lose you. I didn't know that's how you felt, Kyle. Yeah. You were always enough. Always. I just want my family back. Daddy. - Hey. - All right. Let's end there for today. You guys did great. It's a great session. You guys should be really proud of the progress you're making. All right, we gotta get you ready, okay? Mwah, you have an awesome day at school, and I wanna hear all about it. Americano? Good morning. I think it was a great morning. Hm, you know what would make an even better morning? If we drove to work in one car together. I'll think about it. Morning, Cassie. He looks happy this morning. Guessing counseling went well. I think we're making real progress. It feels different. Good now. He's really trying. Love it. You know, I'm rooting for both of you. It's the firm's 30th anniversary and it's three weeks away. I'm excited to announce that the yacht club has a cancellation and we can host the event there. - Ah. - Oh, there. My parents worked hard to build this company, and I thought it would be a great way to honor them. Your parents loved boating. Yeah. So mark your calendars. There's one other development that I'd like to share with you all. Recently, we've acquired some major clients, and if we want to continue with this trajectory, we have to have a bigger outreach. I've decided that the best way to expand this company to other states is to partner with a PR firm that already has a stronghold in those areas. And the company I feel most comfortable partnering with is Viator. I know this is a big move, but it's a business decision that my parents thought about for a long time and didn't end up making before their passing. I believe in the future of this company and want to see it grow and succeed in the way that I know it can. Is this an acquisition? No. Sounds like an acquisition. We'll be using their resources in those areas, and they'll take a percentage of the payment. It's a partnership. There will be no buyout of our company. When did you talk to them? I've been talking to them for a few weeks now. And the next step is getting everyone here on board and contracts, which I plan to draft and sign in the next month. You can play with your Legos after homework, okay? Mommy! Are you all right? I-I-I think my heart literally fell out of my body. I almost hit you. I was just, uh, um. I'm here for the interview for the babysitting position. Yes. Oh! Sorry about the scare. I wasn't expecting you for another hour. I know. It's totally my fault. I was coming from out of town and I didn't know how long it would take me. This is a beautiful place. - Thank you. - Did you build this yourself? No, it belonged to my parents. You grew up here? I moved here when I was three. Lily, right? Yeah. How long have you been working with kids? Uh, few years now. You said you just got to town. Where were you coming from? Down south. Texas. Oh, my, my family's originally from Texas. Oh. What do you think of Forest Hills so far? Mommy? I saw someone outside. It's probably just an animal, honey. Didn't we say dinner? What's going on? - Daddy! - Lily, this is my husband, Kyle. Kyle, this is Lily. She's interviewing to be Nina's babysitter. I don't wanna intrude on dinner. No, not at all. We, we always have more than enough. It'll be good for you to spend time with Nina. Nina, why don't you show Lily what you've been working on there? A babysitter? Uh, with all our new clients I've been working later, and I need someone to help watch Nina a few afternoons a week. I don't feel comfortable with some stranger being alone with our child. Well, that stranger came from a reputable site. She's got great references. When did you decide to do this? I don't know, two weeks ago. Why didn't you ask me about it? We're both meeting her now, at the same time. I don't know what the problem is. I will find someone, if you're desperate for a babysitter. Kyle, relax. You don't even know her. Yes, that's the point. We don't know her. It's my child and I should have been consul. He's right. I misled you. I answered your babysitting ad because I wanted to meet you, actually. Me? I- I wanted to know who you were. I'm not following. I don't know how to say this. I, um. We're related. Related how? We're, we're sisters. What? I can't tell if this is a joke, or. I'm not joking. I'm your older sister. I don't understand, I. If I can just explain. I think that we, our parents. I think you need to leave. I know you need time to digest. Um, I'm sorry. Here's my number. Maybe we can talk more about it tomorrow. You're not actually gonna believe that woman, are you? - My parents' names are on- - Em. Her birth certificate. Anybody can forge that. Well, why would someone lie about something like this? I don't know, but why would she show up just out of the blue? It is all very suspicious. Mommy, mommy! Are, are you okay? Em, sometimes you're too trusting. You can't just let anyone in. All right, she'll dream. You know, Em, I don't feel comfortable leaving the two of you alone here tonight. I mean, what if that woman comes back? We'll be fine. I could sleep in the other room. I appreciate that, Kyle, but we'll be fine. There was something so familiar about her. Don't let that rattle you. You know, Em, I have to be honest, I feel like you're hiding things from me. Hiding from you? Yeah, first the Viator thing this morning, now you're looking for a babysitter. Why aren't we talking about these things? There was already so much going on between us, I didn't know how to bring all this extra stuff into the mix. But these are huge decisions, Em. Look, I get it, that you are someone who likes to run everything yourself, but there are those of us who care about you and wanna help you. Especially if we're partners inside and outside of work. You're right. I'm sorry, I should have talked to you about it. Look at us communicating. Your sister? That's what she said. I don't even know what to say. What are you gonna do? I'm trying to see what I can find about her online, but so far I haven't found anything. Her name doesn't show up anywhere. Not even on social sites. Well, that could be a really good thing or a really bad thing. My sister's best friend's aunt met this guy who didn't have any digital trace, and he ended up- Being a serial killer? Being a very nice guy. How's it going? We were just discussing your supposed new family member. She's a fraud. Is this fraud my height and has curly auburn hair? I'm gonna tell her to leave. No, don't. I asked her to come. What? Why? Because she agreed to do a DNA test, so we're going to see Dr. Andrews. Then we'll know for sure, right? Emily. This is awkward. It really is. I'm sorry I lied to you about the babysitter position. How do you walk into someone's life and just say, "I'm the older sister you never knew you had"? I didn't know how to go about doing any of this. Maybe a letter? - Right. - Or a phone call. Okay. In hindsight, I can see that either of those methods could have worked. Honestly, I wanted to meet you first before I said anything. I just wanted to find out what kind of a person you were. It's a lot to take in. I know. I have so many questions. Well, ask away. Well, how old were you when my parents- - Sent me away? I was about six years old. Where did you grow up? In a boarding facility. Did they ever come visit you? No. Did you ever try to contact them? I didn't want anything to do with them. I regret that now. I wish I'd had the opportunity to say goodbye. It's just, I, I can't imagine them ever doing something like that and to not even say anything before they passed. People can surprise you. How well do you really know anyone? Why do you think they didn't say anything? I don't know. Maybe they were hoping you'd forget. Forget what? The years that overlapped. What do you mean? You were two when they sent me away. You're too young to remember anything. I barely remember anything. The one thing that sticks out in my memory is this toy that you had. It was like a red dog or something. A fox. It was a red fox. You were obsessed with that thing. It was literally attached to you at all times. Are you both ready? Let's do it. Hello? Hi, this is Emily Caldwell. I'm calling about a payment that my parents made to the school years ago. Oh, we haven't been a school for some time. We're a nonprofit organization now. Well, my parents made a payment to the organization every year. Could you tell me what that was for, if, if I gave you their name? What year did they give the money? I don't know the exact span of years, but I-I definitely know it was in the '90s. I'm afraid I can't help you. We only keep files on our end for seven years. If they were paying for a student, those files would be shipped to them post-graduation. So you would've sent the files to my parents? If they were the custodians on the account, yes. All right, thank you. Hey. Thought you all had forgotten about this place until that man showed up to look at it. What man? Someone's been to see this locker? Yeah. Last week. Are you sure? Sure I'm sure. Nobody's been to this locker in five years, so I definitely remember he came to see that one. And he had the code? Yes, ma'am. Well, do you remember his name? Did he have to sign in? No, we don't have sign-ins here. It's that big one right over there. Hello? Get cozy. - Thank you. - There you go. Good? Yeah. Okay. Mommy. Are you all right? What happened? - Hi. - Mommy. Hey. Nina, Cassie's here. Why don't you, why don't you get your magic set and show her some of your tricks? I wanna stay here with you. We just need to talk for a little bit, honey. - Okay, Mommy. - There you go. Thank you. Come on, sweetie, let's go. I went to my parents' storage unit and this man jumped out and grabbed me. Grabbed you? What was he trying to do? I don't know. It was terrifying. What did the police say? Uh, that he most likely was looking for something valuable. Apparently it happens a lot. Were there security cameras? They said they weren't working. Of course not. Hmm. What were you even doing at your parents' storage unit? Um, I was looking for some old paperwork from my parents. The manager said that a man had been to the storage unit in the past week and had the code. It was me. I went there. I was looking for something nostalgic to give you as a gift. Maybe refinish the old desk. You've been missing your parents a lot lately, and I thought that it could help. How did you know about the unit? Your dad showed it to me. When we cleaned out the files from his office, that's where we put them. I thought you knew about that. Listen, Em, I think we need to take a pause with everything that's happening at work. - Why? - Because this is a big deal. You need to recover from this. Oh, don't be silly. The anniversary party isn't for another couple weeks. I'm hungry. Yeah, me too. Cass, you wanna stay for dinner? Yeah, I'd love to. There's something I need to tell you. Can we just talk about it after dinner, please? I-I tried knocking. The front door was locked, so I just came round back. I wasn't sure if you got my message. I didn't realize you invited her. It's so beautiful. Thank you. How are you feeling? I'm better now that everyone is here. Ah-huh. Um, thank you. We're just about to sit to eat. You should join us. Oh, okay. Kyle is an exceptional cook. - Oh, really? - Well, exceptional is a strong word. Are you staying in town, Lily? Uh, no, I'm at the Gold Coast Inn. Oh. It's the best I can afford at the moment. Maybe I can help you find a place closer to town. That would be amazing. Thank you. Yeah. Of course. So what's the plan, Lily? Fake being Emily's sister, and then what? I'm not faking. I don't know what he's talking about. Okay, I was gonna say something after dinner, but I can't just sit here and listen to her manipulate you. When I was leaving work, Dr. Andrews called and he said the DNA test results were ready. So I went by, picked them up and opened them. I'm telling the truth. It says you're not my sister. That's impossible. You see, if anyone reads that document, they're never gonna believe you. So I think it's time for you to leave. Emily, I'm telling you the truth. I'm your sister. I think you should go. I'm sorry. What just happened? I'm sorry, Em. I know you were really hoping that she was your sister. I'm just so confused. I mean, why would she lie about this? I don't know. She obviously really wanted something from you. But she knew things. How could she know all those things about me and my family? She obviously did her research. And even her name. Lilies were my mother's favorite flower. Just all seemed to add up. Even the payments to that academy. What academy? My parents made a payment to this school for years. I just assumed that it was for Lily. It was probably just a donation. I mean, your parents gave a lot of money to a lot of different charities. But think about it, Em, this woman just shows up. She doesn't call you for all those years. You can't find anything about her online. This is someone who doesn't want you to know who they really are. I think I miss my parents. And when Lily showed up maybe I thought that a part of them was coming back to me. I should have known it was too good to be true. Em, you have a family. I felt so lonely lately. I know. But you and Nina are everything to me. You're the only thing that matters, and yes, I know I messed up. But I'm always gonna be here for you. I know. I guess it makes sense. It's, I can't imagine my parents giving their child away and never speaking of it again. Yeah. Tonight I was reminded why I love you. Oh, yeah? You were always great at protecting me. You were looking out for me and I didn't listen. I'm sorry. Okay. So then let's make a promise. The two of us will always be a team, and we'll have each other's backs no matter what. - Promise. - Mm. I was thinking. About getting in the hot tub? No, I-I have to get that thing fixed. No, I already got it fixed. What? When? Well, you mentioned it a few weeks ago, so I called someone. They came out, they fixed it. It should, it should be working. So what do you think? It's a perfect night. A couple glasses of wine. The two of us. We do another night? Deal. What are you thinking? I was thinking that maybe you should move back in. Do you really? Do you really mean that? Yes. It's the right next step. We both wanna be together, so has to happen eventually. And you're right, you, you belong here, you're family. Okay. - You ready to go, sweetie? - Mm-hmm. Here. Oh, no, I don't need those. I was thinking we could take one car to work today. I'll race ya. All right. May I have your bag? But wait, there's more. I'm gonna close the door, okay, sweetie? After you. Oh. I could get used to this. - Could you? - Mm-hmm. No, I've got it. Thank you. Come on, we're late. We're late! - Bye, honey. - Bye, Mom. Want me to get your backpack? Yep. Got it. Yeah? Let me get this one. - Okay. - Okay. Come on, come on. Hi, Cassie. Um, I just need to tell you about- Oh, uh, Cassie, hang on a second, um, my battery's about to die. I forgot to charge my phone last night. Ah, hang on a second. Cassie, hang on. Hang on, hang on. Oh. - Em? - See if he's got one. Em? Cassie, are you still there? Oh. Em, let's go! What is this? Emily, you weren't listening to me. You, you told me it wasn't a match. Wait, you showed me a document that said it wasn't a match. You were so adamant to have this person in our lives that we barely know. So you forged fake documents and lied to me? Lily's not a good person. What evidence do you have that she's not a good person? That's what I thought. We just spent the entire night talking about having each other's backs, how we're family. Emily, I'm just, I'm asking you- - You promised me honesty. How can you not see that Lily is lying to you? Kyle, the only person lying to me is you. How can you not see that? Em. That is the real document from my doctor's office. I found it in Kyle's trunk this morning. I don't know why you would lie about this. Maybe you felt threatened? Maybe. He has said recently that he was always afraid of losing me. Is this the first time he's done something like this? No. We've had some trouble lately. About six months ago, Kyle was acting weird, stressed out more than usual. He kept saying it was work. Eventually I found out that he had taken money out of our savings and invested it without telling me, and then lost all of it. I'm so sorry. Yeah, it's been a rough few months, and now this. We started marriage counseling and I thought it was working, but. Right before I moved here, I'd just gotten out of a bad relationship. Really? It made me wanna get in touch with you. I want someone in my life I can trust. In the beginning it was great. He was great. Then he started lying more and more, and eventually I just got sick of it. I guess that runs in the family. Can we start fresh? Maybe you could come over to the house later and spend time with Nina and I? I would love that, but I'm actually leaving town today. You're leaving? Why? It's embarrassing to say this, but I'm out of money. No one seems to be hiring in this town. Well, why don't you come work at the PR firm? Really? What would I even do there? Anything. We could start you part-time for now, and, and you could stay at the house. Nina would love that. - Are you sure? - Yes. You're family. You mentioned over the phone you wanted to discuss marital assets. Are you, uh, thinking of getting a divorce? Uh, no. It's a little more complicated than that. Well, you've come to the right office. We specialize in complicated. My wife and I have been separated for a few months. We share a daughter. Our home, and the place of business where we work, were inherited from her parents when they passed away. Now, recently, a relative has come back into her life and I'm worried that- - The relative wants to get their hands on some of the inheritance. Exactly. She has already come between me and my family, and I'm worried it's just gonna get worse. Are we talking any relative, or? It's a sister that she never knew she had. Oh, I see. That is complicated. Nothing, I just. I get this impression that this sister doesn't want me around my family. Hm, what has she done so far? I don't have specifics. It's, it's a general feeling. Unless you can prove malice with intent, there's not much a legal court can do. So you're saying I have to prove she's dangerous? Normally? Yeah. Well, we've gone through all the nuts and bolts. Organization of files, sharing accounts. Basically I bored her to death for an hour. Okay. Well, let's hear it. What are your biggest takeaways so far? Important to connect personally with clients, someone they can trust. When we send out proposals, we do a three-month, six-month, and one-year trajectory plan. Pretty good for only being here a couple of hours. We actually have a new client coming in right now. I think it would be great for you to sit in on the meeting and see how it all works. Who's the client? Aurora Botanicals. It's infused with all natural oils that block the rapidly changing hormone levels from affecting the underlying skin layer. What inspired you to start this brand? After I had my baby, I had a facial acne problem for the first time in my life. Um, and the skincare company that I had at that time developed a product to help women with this exact same problem. But, after we started marketing, we found out that the side effects to those products were far worse than the acne. Some of the women's skin would either itch or burn, and eventually we found out some of the chemicals we used could actually cause skin cancer. It was a nightmare. So I just, I just really wanna help women by giving them products that were safe and effective. Your passion is what's gonna help sell your product. That's the strategy that we start with. We bring your personal connection- - Oh, um, I-I-I don't wanna be in any of the videos, or, or pictures. Well, typically we see the best response to brands when there's a familiar face behind it. It's a way to personalize the company. I would prefer if I wasn't in it. I think the brand name alone and what it gives to people is more than enough. I mean, if, if, if that's an issue, I can just, I can just go find another PR company. Did something happen? I am sure that we can find a way to, to- - I looked up your previous company, the one that you had with your husband? Ex-husband, and, and what does that have to do with, with anything? I saw that you had some legal trouble with that company. I know what it's like to wanna start over. I think that you start with being honest about your past mistakes. Look, in a world where everything is photoshopped, where people are constantly posting online about how happy they are when they're really miserable, people are looking for authenticity. I know I am. If you're honest about your past mistakes and that Aurora Botanicals is your way of helping women feel better about their real selves, I think you can build your brand and gain back some of your previous clientele. Build back that trust that you have with them. Yes, but my ex-husband ran our previous company into the ground. We were sued by so many clients. Look, I, ah, I just really want you guys to run PR and make sure that my name is kept out of the new, new brand. I think we should do the opposite. Like Emily said, your clients are going to want to connect with you. When they hear you speak honestly about your story, they'll see your dedication. We've all made mistakes. I know I have. And it's hard. It's scary to put yourself out there, but you owe it not just to your clients, but to yourself. You really think they'll react positively. I think so. We can walk you through the steps of what that would look like so you can get comfortable with it all. And you guys have really helped restore other people's reputations? Yes, many. It's one of the aspects of this job I like most. All right. We'll talk to the rest of the team and we'll send a proposal over to you soon. I look forward to working with both of you. Can I talk to you in my office for a second? Sure. I, uh, I wanna apologize. We clearly got off on the wrong foot. My only intention was to protect Emily, but I hope we can put that behind us now that I hear you're, uh, joining the team. All right, thank you. Yeah. That was nice. Don't feel bad for him. He made his bed, now he has to lie in it. Thanks for letting me be part of the meeting today. Of course. You did a good job. Maybe I can do the next one by myself. Ah. I mean, if you think. Like I said, Lily, you did a good job, but there's just so much more to learn and experience before handling an entire portfolio by yourself. Right. Totally understandable. You done? - Mm-hmm. - Thank you, Mommy. - You okay? - Yeah. You're not still mad at me, are you? No, of course not. You get like I do when you're hyper-focused on something. You just laser in and drown everything else out. I'm thinking about Kyle. Anything I can do to help? Mm, turn back time? Well, while I get on that, how about I put Nina to bed and you can get some much needed relaxation time. That would be great. The fox leaped up and grabbed onto the branch. "Just like this," said the fox, and then the two of them- - Lily? Yeah? Is my daddy going to come back to stay here? I don't know, sweetie. That's up to your mommy and daddy. I miss when he used to live here. They fight a lot now. I don't want them to be sad. I know exactly how you feel. You do? Mm-hmm, my parents used to fight a lot. Why did they fight? I don't know. I was around your age when it happened. But you know what? I will always be here for you no matter what. I promise. Help! I don't understand. What happened? It sounds like you were electrocuted. What? Electrocuted? Maybe there's a loose wire. It can't happen. Oh. Here's the. Thank you. Shouldn't you be resting? I feel a little weak, but I can handle it. Wow, look at you, all ready and dressed for school. Are you sure you don't wanna take today off? No, there's too much to do at the office. Nina, I think your mom is Superwoman. Wanna head out in five? Sure, let me grab my bag. I'll be right there. Hey. I know that last night was probably pretty scary for you, but I'm okay. Why did Grandma and Grandpa hurt Lily? What do you mean? Lily said they weren't nice to her. When did she say that? Last night. Yes, Cassie? Get in there. - What? - Now! Okay. I saw you in town the other day. Okay? I know that the law office you were visiting handles divorce cases. Emily is my best friend and I don't wanna see her get hurt anymore. I don't mean to be rude, but my marriage is none of your business. I can't keep this from her. I'm giving you the chance to tell her first. Are you giving me an ultimatum? Everything all right? Yeah. Cassie, I was thinking that you could help show Lily how we prepare for client pitches today. Of course. Let's do it. Can you get me the number for the guy that you sent to fix the hot tub? Did it break again? No, he left a live wire inside and it electrocuted me last night. What? Are you okay? Can you just get me the number? Okay, Em, please. Em, can we talk? No. It is way too early for Lily to be taking clients. Kyle, I don't wanna talk right now. I need space to process everything that has happened. We have to talk about it eventually. Then I will let you know when eventually is. Can we at least talk about work. If it's unrelated to Lily, sure. Okay. So, um, what's going on with Viator? Have you signed paperwork for partnering with them yet? Not yet. Well, I think the company should meet them and then we should all discuss it. I totally agree. That's why I invited them to the anniversary party so you can have your chance to ask them whatever questions you want then. Ah. How long will it take? Shouldn't take long. It's urgent. It always is. We work hard because we care. In a world where authenticity is becoming increasingly more rare, we wanna be the public relations firm you can trust. Here at Viator, we work one-on-one with brands, big and small. We know what it's like to work your business from the ground up and also what it's like to keep your already-successful business afloat- - Nina's asleep. In this highly competitive time. Still burning the midnight oil? The company that I want to partner with, they redid their website, so I was just checking it out. Viator, right? Yeah. I know some people at work are apprehensive about this change, but I feel good about it. I can't tell you how great it is to have someone helping me. Thank you so much, Lily. Of course. It's what family's for. So I've heard. I would suggest a relaxing dip in the hot tub, but I imagine that's off limits for a while. Hm, I never wanna go in that thing again. Fair enough. There was something that I- I wanted to talk to you about. What's up? Um, well, you know, the day that I went to the storage unit? I went there because I was hoping to find something that might tell me more about why you were sent away. I just, I needed to know for myself. And I found this article that my, our parents had saved, uh, about a family car accident that paralyzed a woman. I'm sorry, we haven't talked about this before. I guess I-I was afraid to tell you the truth. The truth? It was my fault. I'm the reason she was paralyzed. What do you mean, you caused the accident? There was a, an event that we were all supposed to go to one night. I didn't wanna go, so we were fighting on the front porch. It was winter. The steps were icy. And I pushed her away from me and I ran back inside. And she, she slipped. She fell all the way down the stairs. Right, right as our father was pulling around to pick us up. He tried to stop. But he, she fell right in front of the car. It was too late. I didn't mean to hurt her, but she blamed me. When, when the boarding facility came to pick me up, she didn't even come out to say goodbye. That was the last time I ever saw her. I'm sorry I never said anything. I- I don't think I've ever shared that with anyone before. I'm so sorry that all of that happened to you, I. I tried to visit you once. Really? When? Right after I graduated. I wanted to confront them and I thought maybe we could be a family. When I drove by, I-I saw the three of you. You looked so happy. I couldn't do it. I chickened out. I was too scared. Why did you decide to come back now? I always felt like I was missing something. Everybody always had something I didn't. A family, and I wanted one so badly. When I heard our parents died, I thought maybe, I thought maybe you could love me. You know, I-I've always felt like there was something missing too. I'm really grateful that we were able to find our way back to one another. Do you think all of these things going on are weird? Almost getting electrocuted in a hot tub is like one-in-a-million. It's beyond weird. Should I be worried? Worried about what, exactly? I don't know, that they're related somehow? That's an absurd thought, right? You're just under a lot of stress. It'll all be okay. This is just a rough patch. So how long have you been experiencing any dizziness? A few days. Any loss of eyesight? Any tingling sensation in your arms or legs? - No. - What about memory? Huh, you been having trouble remembering things? No. That's good news. Huh? Just sounds like stress fatigue. No concussion from the attack. No nerve damage from the electrocution. Oh wait, Ms. Caldwell. There was a problem with your credit card. Do you have another one? That can't be right. I've tried it multiple times. Here. The Aurora client is on line one. Okay, thank you. Hi. Is everything okay? I just received your proposal and it's not at all what we discussed. Uh, hold on. Are you there? Yes, I'm so sorry. I- I just got into the office a few minutes ago. I'm looking at the document now. I don't know why it was sent out this morning. I was caught by surprise and frankly, I'm a little upset. I understand, I would be too. I am very sorry. I did not approve this. We will get it straightened out right away and we'll send over the proposal that we talked about. All right, thank you. Why was the Aurora proposal sent out this morning without my approval? Oh, I-Lily said you okayed it. What? Where is she? Uh, I don't. Can I talk to you for a minute? Is-is everything okay? No, it's not. Cassie just said that you approved a document that went out to the Aurora client this morning. We had discussed- - We never discussed it. I talked about how to set it up if you were the one doing it, but I never said that you could approve a document and send it out to one of our clients. I thought that since my initial meeting with her went so well, it would be okay. We could potentially lose them as a client over this. I'm sorry. Come in. I've had a strange morning, Marty. Oh dear. How can I help? I was hoping you could keep this between us. Of course. There's money missing from two of my accounts. What do you mean missing? I checked both my personal and my business account and there's a chunk of money missing. Well, that is very concerning. If they were withdrawals and I didn't okay them, then that means someone forged my signature. Let's not jump to conclusions. I'm sure there's an explanation. Did you look to see what specific withdrawals were made in the last few weeks? I was going to do that today, but now I have to put out a fire with the Aurora client. So I was wondering if you could look into it while I handle that. Absolutely. Absolutely. Thank you. So this is our three different color arrangement. You said the event was at the yacht club, correct? Mm-hmm. We can also do a nautical theme. Uh, well, we want something celebratory, but a little more elegant. Of course. We've got several options. Why don't we start over here? This one. Lilies. Mom's favorite. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I should have asked you about it. I don't know what I was thinking. I- I guess I just, I really thought that you would approve it. I wanted you to know I could do it. I'm pretty particular about the proposals. Is it fixable? I think so. It's just, there's so much that's been going on, and then I got that call from the Aurora client and it was the last straw with all the stress. I didn't mean to take it out on you. I-I want you to know I'm here for you. I don't know what to do, Lily. I'm, I'm so confused about everything. I feel like I'm going crazy. We can figure it out together. Sorry to interrupt, but it's for sure the lilies, then? Yes. Great. Where's Nina? Nina! Nina! Hello? Hello? Nina? Nina? Nina! Nina! Oh, thank God. You can't just take off like that. We didn't know where you were! - I'm sorry. - I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's okay, sweetie. Kyle, I can't talk right now! What? What happened? Oh, hey, hey, hey. How are you? Where is she? She's just inside. She's just inside. You wanna go play? Yeah. All right. All right. Kyle. Please just leave me alone. Hey, can we play? Ahhuh. - Who can I be? - This one. Oh yeah? Does this one? What happened? The back door was locked, so I took the stairs and I tripped. Saying it's an accident, but I saw someone in the stairwell. What? - Mm. - Did you call security? Yeah. They're saying that it was probably the building janitor, since he's the one who found me. Do you think someone pushed you? I do remember tripping on the stairs. Told the janitor that I felt something, but when he checked, he said there wasn't anything. But, Emily, something just doesn't feel right. I-I'm canceling the anniversary party. What? No, don't do that. Cassie, you're in the emergency room and everything that's happened to me the last couple weeks. You've been planning this for months. I know what this means to you. If you cancel this because me, I would just feel more awful. - Cass. - Please. Okay, I-I won't cancel it. Well, there's, there's something else I wanted to tell you. - Cassie. - But it's- - How are you feeling? Mm. Mommy, you're so pretty. Oh, you look beautiful. Thank you. This is the fanciest thing I own. Do you think it's okay? Hold on. I have just the thing for you. It was our mother's. Oh, I don't think- - I want you to have it. Here, and you'd be silly not to wear it because it goes perfectly with your dress. Here, let me help you. I love it. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm all right. I'm just thinking about Cassie. We should take a picture for her. You have my phone? Great. Okay. Hi. Hey. - Speech. - Okay. Thank you all for coming. This milestone, it means so much to me, and it, and it would've meant so much to my parents. Six years ago we lost my father, and a year after that, we lost my mother. They built this company together from the ground up. I practically grew up at the offices. I remember asking my parents why they started this company, and they said that it made them feel proud to help other people's businesses become successful. I find it very difficult to fill my parents' shoes, but with the help of all of you, I, I feel so blessed to be able to continue their legacy. So thank you so much for all of your hard work and dedication, it, it means the world to me. And lastly, uh, a few weeks ago, I, I got the most wonderful surprise. And that was finding out that I had a sibling I never even knew existed. I'm very happy to have my sister Lily in my life now and even more proud that she's the newest member of Caldwell PR. So thank you everyone. Please enjoy tonight, and yeah, thank you. How did I do? Fantastic. Thank you. - Great speech. - Mm, huh. Would you mind if I had a moment alone? - No, of course. - Yeah? I'll see you. You were right. What did you find? There is some odd activity in one of the accounts. It's all in here. There's been some cash withdrawals. All in the last two weeks. Why didn't our accountants catch it? They're small sums, so they'd go under the radar of anything substantial, but they add up. I don't know what these withdrawals are. I didn't approve any of them. I'm sorry, Em, it's not the best time to tell you all this, but I wanted to tell you sooner rather than later. No, it's okay. Thank you, Marty. I appreciate it. Can I talk to you for a second? Okay. What is going on? Did you forge my signature on accounts to withdraw money? I can't believe you even asked me that question. Well, it's not that far of a stretch for you. That's unfair. Are you telling me the truth? Yes, of course. And I'm just curious, are you gonna ask Lily this question too? What does this have to do with Lily? What do you have against her? I don't get it. Ever since she showed up, a lot of things have been happening. I've been thinking about that too. Maybe somebody's doing all this to make it look like it could be her. - Okay. If you're- - Hi, sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt. Not at all. I'm so happy you could make it and to finally meet you in person. Yeah, likewise. Uh, Thomas Viator. Hi. - Hey. - Nice to meet you. I guess we will talk about this later. I was, uh, really moved by your speech. Oh. Viator's been in my family for years. It's, it's a lot of pressure carrying on a legacy. It is. I am constantly second guessing myself. How do you handle all the pressure? One day at a time. Maybe some naive confidence I've gotten from obstacles before, and I know I can get through it again. Well, thank you for coming out. Yeah. Did you get to meet some of the team? Yeah. Yeah, they seem like really great people. They really are. Some of them have been working at the company for over 20 years. I have to admit, there's a little apprehension around us possibly partnering. Yeah, I can understand that. Probably worried about their jobs, but as long as you continue to ensure them that it's a safe partnership, I think they'll come around. You're different from what I expected. Really? How so? I don't know. I- I know that we met on Zoom and, uh, but in person, I-I guess I expected someone more corporate. Oh, well, I hope you're not disappointed. No. No, the opposite. Um, well, I would love to meet the rest of the team. Maybe we should, uh, head back to the party? Yeah, um, I-I'll be there in a minute. Okay. Emily? - Emily? - Hold on. I-I'm really worried, Em, who's doing all of this? You're gonna think I'm horrible for saying this, but Kyle just, he hasn't been himself lately. I mean, he, he was the one who went to the storage unit and he had the code. He had the hot tub fixed, and he was at the party where I also found out that money was fraudulently taken out of my accounts, again. You think I'm horrible for saying that. No. No, actually. Look, I-I didn't wanna be the one to tell you, but I don't think I can keep this from you any longer. Hi, Ms. Caldwell. We've gone over everything you've, uh, disclosed. We talked to Cassie who is positive her slip down the stairs was not an accident. We didn't find anything on the stairs. That could mean that someone cleaned up after her fall. But what we did find was that someone broke the door lock, so the door could not be opened. That, coupled with your attacks, we're positive it all points to premeditated murder. Do you have any suspects? Not yet. Does your husband live here? No, we're, uh, we've been living apart for a few months now. Do you have a good relationship? We did. I don't, I don't know anymore. Why are you asking me about Kyle? The only way into your work building is through the use of a key card, right? Yes. The night that Cassie fell, Kyle's key card was the last one to swipe in and out. We spoke to Kyle who said his key card had been stolen the previous week. He never mentioned that, um, but if, if he put in a request for a new one, there might be a record of that. Is Kyle a suspect? It's protocol that we look at everyone. My assistant told me that Kyle visited a, a divorce attorney. What? She saw him going into a, a law office building. She Googled it and they only handle divorces and estates. Is he the sole beneficiary if something would happen to you? Yes, it would all go to him, and then eventually our daughter. All right. Well, if we have any more questions, I'll keep in touch. I'll see my way out. Thank you. Who are you calling? The locksmith. We're changing the locks immediately. Oh. It's okay. It's not okay. How is any of this okay? You're right. It's not okay. It's absolutely completely scary. But I'm here and I'm not going anywhere. Do you think Kyle's really doing all of this? I don't know. How can someone that you think you know so well turn out to be someone so different? I mean, was everything that we had a lie? No. I think sometimes people are driven to do things that surprise even themselves. It doesn't mean that the good times weren't real, or that he never meant any of it. It just, he's choosing to do bad right now. It'll be fine. I promise it'll all be okay. What book do you wanna read tonight? How about Father Rabbit? Did you hear us talking? I'm sorry, sweetie. Why are you and Daddy fighting? It's complicated, Nina. I wish I could explain it to you, but just know that Daddy and I love you so much and it has nothing to do with you, okay? Do you wanna come sleep in my bed tonight? No. Can Lily read to me? Well, I was thinking I could. I want Lily to read to me. Okay. Nina wants you to read to her. Um, I-I'll be right in. The locksmith just left. He changed all the doors. Oh, thank you. Emily, I just want to talk. Lily is lying to you. There are things you do not know. You need to leave. I hired someone to look into her past, a private investigator, and I'm telling you, she is not telling you the whole truth. Kyle, you're really scaring me. The accident that your mother got in, the one that left her in the wheelchair? I know about the accident. Lily told me our mother blamed her for paralyzing her. No, she's not telling you the full story! Em! I just want to talk. You have to let me in, please. - What's going on? - Kyle's here. We have to call the police. To talk. Em, Em! Em, let me explain! Here we go, baby girl, I need you to get up, come on. Listen, I need you to stay in here and don't come out, whatever you hear, all right? Let me in! Did you call the police? I-I don't know where my phone is. Please. Please, I just want to explain. Please, just let me in. You stay with Nina. If you don't leave, I'm calling the police. I just wanna talk. If you don't wanna let me in, just come to the window, okay? We were going through a hard time. I dated somebody. That's what you're banging on my door to tell me? It was Lily. What? At the time I didn't know that you were sisters, but she obviously knew who you were. I didn't wanna come clean because I didn't wanna risk losing you. But now, with everything that's happened, with the police thinking I'm a suspect, I had to tell you. This has gone on far enough. She's the one behind all the attacks. I'm sure of it. She was with me when Cassie fell. Well, she must have gotten somebody to do her dirty work. I saw her go into my office. When I confronted her, she said Cassie just asked her to get something, but shortly after my key card went missing. This is ridiculous. I hired a private investigator to dig into her background. He got access to her sealed juvenile records. Em, you had a baby brother that she was accused of killing, of smothering, and your parents, they feared for their lives, so they sent her away. I know that all of this sounds crazy, but you have to believe me. This sounds more than crazy. I'm calling the police. Em, Em! Em! Em! I can't let you do that. Lily, what are you doing? Oh-uh. Oh, I don't- - Lily, wait! I wondered when you were finally gonna come clean. Oh, it must have been agonizing when you didn't know whether, if or when I was gonna tell her the truth. But you left out the part where you wanted to be with me. How your wife didn't understand you. How we were gonna run away together. You used me to get to Emily. Don't for one second think that you're the victim in this! You're right. He is a liar. But he does love you. He's never gonna leave you. Yeah, that doesn't matter. I don't care. I don't care about that. What I care about is everything else you've got. All of this! How come you got all of this when I got nothing? There were nights I had to beg people for food. I wanted to help you. Oh, really? You were gonna, you were gonna sign away half the house, half the business, 'cause that's what I'm entitled to. I'll sign, I'll sign whatever paperwork you want right now. No, I don't want paperwork! I want this, all of this, and I don't want you to exist. You're nothing but a replacement for our little brother. You should have never been born either. Emily, run! Mommy! Just go! Go! Open the door, Mommy, hurry! Please, no! Don't move. Give me Nina. Lily, please don't. Give her to me. Give her to me! Give me Nina! Mommy! - Mom! - Baby! Hopefully this is the last time our paths cross. We found this in her bedroom. Either of you missing any money? We'll return the money to you once it's been processed for evidence. We searched her phone and we're gonna apprehend her co-defendant. I'm gonna go check on Nina. She's here, she's here! Surprise! Thank you. Happy birthday. Thank you, honey. That's so sweet. Hi. - Thank you. - Happy birthday. Happy birthday, Em. - It's great. - You're very welcome. Thank You. Hi. Happy birthday. - Thank you, Cassie. - Oh. So Kyle showed up. Yeah. I'm surprised that he's not groveling to get you back. There's no going back, Cassie, but we've reached a good place and it feels right. Mm, so that means you're ready to start dating again? Well, the ink on my divorce isn't dry yet, but. Well, there is someone who I think would be good for you. You invited him? I'm gonna go say hi. Hi. Hi. I'm glad that you came. Happy birthday. Thank you. I promise that this party will not end with me being tossed off a dock. Thank you. Just a gesture to mark the beginning of Caldwell PR and Viator's official partnership. Now we're alive.
