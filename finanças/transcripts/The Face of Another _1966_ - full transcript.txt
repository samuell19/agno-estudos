A TOHO RELEASE A TESHIGAHARA PRODUCTIONS... - TOKYO EIGA COPRODUCTION Recognize these? You know what they are? You don't, do you? You have no idea. They're replicas of body parts. You see? Sadly, this is not only a finger. It's an inferiority complex in the shape of a finger. It's not that I specialize in treating fingers. I'm a psychiatrist, in fact. Inferiority complexes dig holes in the psyche, and I fill them in. THE FACE OF ANOTHER Produced by NOBUYO HORIBA, KIICHI ICHIKAWA and TADASHI OONO Based on the Novel by KOBO ABE Music by TORU TAKEMITSU Cinematography by HIROSHI SEGAWA Production Design by MASAO YAMAZAKI Edited by YOSHI SUGIHARA Starring TATSUYA NAKADAl MIKIJIRO HIRA, KYOKO KISHIDA MIKI IRIE, EIJI OKADA MINORU CHIAKI HIDEO KANZE KUNIE TANAKA ETSUKO ICHIHARA EIKO MURAMATSU YOSHIE MINAMI And Featuring MACHIKO KYO Directed by HIROSHI TESHIGAHARA I was inspecting our new factory. You don't mind my talking like this? No, please continue. Perhaps my technical background made me overconfident. We were to use liquid air with extra nitrogen. But they were short on time and gave me liquid oxygen. They led me to believe it was liquid air. You were terribly unlucky. Yes... but I was to blame as well. If I could have called it destiny, or even a war wound, it wouldn't be so bad. But this is like being in exile. Nobody remembers me... - not even as a cautionary example. You mind stopping that? I've become very sensitive to noise. I'm sorry. I was almost finished. I wonder if losing one's face deranges one's senses. You're tired. Everyone says that. What if we took off the bandages? Out of the question. - Some tea? - No. Come and sit down. You can't sit still for a second when you're not polishing your gems. Come on, sit down. You sat over there so we wouldn't have to look each other in the face. You're imagining things. No matter. I'm planning a little experiment. Care to help? - Aren't you cold? - Are you? No, not very. I'm hot. It's probably the bandages. Why not take them off? They'll ruin your skin. You can't kill something that's already dead. - Your face... - - What? You're old enough not to be so touchy about it. I'll make some tea. - Don't run away. Why would I run away? Why are people so biased about skin color and cheekbones and such? Or repelled by hives, for example? Exactly. What I do know for certain is that you, for one, needn't cover your face with bandages. Why are you so sure you do? Perhaps I wouldn't if I were corresponding by letter, or on the phone. What was your experiment? I'll help you. All right. First turn off the light. Turn it off? Civilization demands light, even at night. That may be. But a man without a face is free only when darkness rules the world. Isn't that why deep-sea fish are so grotesque? How can you compare yourself to... - Compare myself? I live locked in a darkness ten times deeper. What's that noise? What noise? I want to extinguish every last light in the world, or gouge out all of humanity's eyes. If only somebody gave me that right. Eyes aren't only for looking at faces. The face is just a few dozen square inches above the neck, covered with a layer of dough. Isn't that right? I wanted to think so. I told myself a million times it was only a layer of skin, a surface. But now I'm not so sure. The face is the door to the soul. When the face is closed off, so too is the soul. Nobody is allowed inside. The soul is left to rot, reduced to ruins. It becomes the soul of a monster, rotten to the core. I feel as if I've been buried alive. You closed the door yourself. No one's stopping you from getting out. You're right. I and others are on equal terms... as long as we're all in darkness. You see? There's no hope. It was just too sudden. No, you'll never accept me. Why aren't you stopping me? But you work here. How do you know? How do you know I'm not an extortionist in disguise? Tell me. - Your voice... - - My voice? Nonsense. Everyone would sound the same in bandages like these. I'm sorry, sir. What for? Don't worry about it. Hey there. Mind if I smoke? Of course not. Why? A cigarette dangling from a crack in the bandages... it looks freakish. Don't talk like that. Your secretary let me in without confirming my identity. What? I'd like to take some time off. Of course. That's what I've been suggesting. I want time to figure out for myself whether I'm really qualified to stay on here. You're the same person. What's there to figure out? I don't want to take advantage of your kindness. Don't say that! It happened in the line of duty. That's not the problem. I have no face, and yet... - - You're tired. If only it were that. Sometimes I seem like a monster even to myself. Stop tormenting yourself. You think too much. That's just wrong. You're prodding me to cut off your hand instead of replacing your finger. Saving patients is your duty. But carrying out mercy killings is not. Mercy killings? Don't exaggerate. I'm prepared to replace any body part at any time. That's worse than bandages. The obvious deception makes it even more hideous. Would you prefer rotting teeth to false ones? - That's different. - How? Tell me, how is it different? - Go ahead then, if you insist. - May I call the nurse? But remember: You'll be the one responsible. I'll burn my wife's face so it looks like mine. No objections to that, right? Then you can give her your "false teeth" and all will be well. You're talking like a child. A man of your standing! My wife refused me. What good will revenge do? Revenge? Not at all. I'd simply be acting upon your theories and freeing her from her prejudices about faces. That would be therapeutic for me as well. Nothing encourages a patient like being able to trust his doctor. - Are you serious? - Very much so. Serious or no, it makes a good pretext. I'm such a coward, I can't resist such clever excuses. Still, I'd rather not get involved in anything criminal. I don't follow you. I doubt it would succeed, but it would make an interesting experiment. It's against medical ethics, but you've twisted my arm. However, there's one condition. You must tell me everything you do from now on. I'm lending you the mask as a therapeutic tool. It's not yours to keep. Thank you. It came out very well. - Plaster of Paris? - No, sodium alginate. Next we'll use a paraffin mold. - Can you come tomorrow? - Yes, anytime. This is my only work now. SUPERINTENDENT Do you live here? I'm the super. I saw the ad in the paper. I'd like an apartment. You can't. He has a lady visitor. - But I've come for an apartment. - Please don't tell him. I'll give it back right away. Yes? Who is it? I saw your ad in the paper. Any vacancies? I'll be right with you. Sorry to keep you... - Yoko! Did you steal it again? Your daughter? Well, yes. Excuse my appearance. I was taking a bath. About the apartment... - Just a moment. I'll bring you a brochure. The doors lock by themselves. It's a rough neighborhood, hence the chains. Come on in. Here we have the bath. This also locks automatically. This is the toilet. This is the bedroom. Nice view. There's a closet here. I'm as determined as ever. I found a hideout for the mask right after I left yesterday. That's not what I was asking. You mean my plans? What's the purpose of your double life with the mask? Ideally we'll compensate for one another. You think it'll really work that way? You know what I was thinking in that apartment? Let me guess. What to do with all your freedom? No. I was thinking about jealousy. - Jealousy? - Yes. But that's only natural. It's impossible for me to make my wife jealous. You want the mask to make your wife jealous? I want it for all my dealings with people, including that. I'll ask you again: Are you more interested in rejoining society than escaping it? Anything wrong with that? No. Psychologically, it's the healthier inclination. I was afraid... you would use it to escape from yourself. That's all a matter of perspective. This plastic is fascinating. Now it's like clay. But the second you stretch it, it becomes elastic like rubber. The modulus of elasticity is close to that of the skin's cellular tissue. Applied along Langer's lines, it takes on the structure of real skin. Langer's lines? The axes along which collagen fibers are oriented. I see. I wonder how my face will look. That's not to say I don't trust you. Yes, please leave it to me. We can't do much without changing your bone structure and skin's thickness. At most your face will make a slightly different impression than before. How does the mask join the skin? That's the difficult part. It'll be most obvious around the eyelids. You'll need sunglasses. I'm in your hands. I won't complain. It's chilly out. What are you doing? I thought I'd make some tea. We just had some. Stop fussing about, looking for things to do. It makes me feel you're hiding something. Shall I turn off the lights? No. As you see, I'm quite comfortable. I've grown used to the light, or maybe I've given up fighting. - Where'd you go today? - Nowhere in particular. Are you concerned? There's no reason to be. There's not much a man with a bandaged face can do. Still angry at me, aren't you? Come now, don't say it as if you were the victim. I didn't mean it that way. You may be a victim too, after all. Until a few days ago, I half-seriously intended to carve up your face until it looked as bad as mine. It would serve you right: spouting lies about how a disfigured face is no big deal. I understand why you feel you had to say it. The monster is always to blame... - what a convenient stereotype. Everything's the monster's fault. You harp on it so much, I'm beginning to believe it. I think that way because you do. Your attitude makes things so awkward. Why? What makes you imagine that? How am I supposed to... - Never mind. I've outgrown that attitude. Actually, I saw a movie today. I hadn't in a long time. It was cold. Theaters do their business in the dark. You needn't care how you look. - What were they showing? - As I was saying... there was a young girl sitting in front of me. She was alone, but soon a young man sat beside her. There were other seats, but he made a point of sitting right next to her. I'll leave the rest to your imagination. A very bold fellow. Didn't care what anyone thought. - And she let him have his way? - I think so. I mean, I don't know what really went on between them. There were signs something happened, and signs nothing happened. I was startled to realize he had the mindset of a man in a mask. Executioners wore masks long ago. I wonder if they shared the same mentality. I'm watching you closely. You feel you're talking to a hole in the wall, don't you? - What does that mean? - Nothing in particular. There are monsters who act like people, and people who act like monsters. Even monsters have their pleasures. Anyway, stop acting like a victim, and spare me the phony sympathy. Man, what a knockout! Hey, don't be so stuck up. Come on, say something! Open up, please. PSYCHIATRIC WARD NO. 2 Attention! Air raid! Let's play baseball! The air raid's over. A nice breeze. It's a foul wind. I'd like to see the sea. Stupid girl. I meant to tell her something nice. Fine! Have it your way! Hey, lady, get the ball! - Oh, gross! - She's scary! I'm surprised. You're enjoying it even more than he is. Yes, I am. You can't perform such a visionary experiment on just anyone. Wouldn't you like to make a mask for yourself? Never. Simply watching such a perilous stunt is more than enough. Is it that perilous? It's like a drug that makes you invisible. I can't say I understand where you see this leading. What would my wife do if I made a mask for her? Don't do that. I'd like some coffee if it's ready. - Sugar? - Lots. I've been smoking too much. My tongue feels raw. Your wife's listening again. We may be doing a terrible thing. It's frightening. We're violating a cardinal rule of humanity. Perhaps he'II... become someone else and seduce his own wife. You think so? You don't? There are limits in life. Men don't have wings. No matter how high they rise, they always fall back to earth. I've turned into a monster. Brother... there won't be another war soon, will there? Probably not. But who knows? We can't even be sure about tomorrow's weather. That's true. With war, as with everything else, you don't even realize until it's already started. That's really true. Good morning. Don't worry. I'm in a good mood today. Say, will you have lunch with me? Just kidding. A mask makes a man bold. Think nothing of it. Just pretend I'm drunk. I've thought a lot since our last meeting. I've managed to calm down a bit. I'd like to talk rationally about my future. What's there to talk about? Keep working here as before. There's nothing more to it. No, I can't deal with people anymore. Let's not pretend otherwise. I can still handle technical matters, though. I'll have to wear the bandages for life. If possible, I'd like to return to the factory at my present pay. I don't see what's wrong with the current arrangement. But if you insist... - That's a load off my shoulders. I'll arrange it before your leave's up. Is your wife well? Why? "Why?" Don't clobber me for asking. From now on, I'll exist via telephone calls, documents, letters. No offense, but all you'll see of me is my signature. I want to be as inconspicuous as possible. Well, I suppose we'll both get used to it. Your face has lost its usual cheerfulness. A few minutes looking at me leaves you exhausted. No wonder my wife's not looking too well. Well, I'll be leaving now. How would he be? That face? Not the features... but the dimensions and skin texture. Isn't he a bit young? He looks easy to persuade. Shall we go in? What'll you have? - It's kind of early for lunch. - A cola, then? Pardon us. Two colas. One for me too. We'd like to ask you a big favor. What? What the hell's that? The favor is worth 10,000 yen. What do you say? You haven't told me yet what it is. We'd like you to sell us your face. My face? A mold of your face, that is. We wouldn't skin you for a measly 10,000 yen. Just a mold? We won't use it for anything illicit. But isn't that like taking my fingerprints? The shape of a glove changes with the wearer. We only wish to reproduce your pores and sweat glands. Just the surface details. This one's a waste of time. There's nothing to lose, yet he refuses. Let's go. I still don't get it. What are you buying it for? Please take it. I'm going to Kansai tomorrow for a week. - Business? - I assume you don't object. Of course not. I'll have to pack your things. When do you leave? This is a surprise. I thought you'd be impressed: I've pulled myself together enough for a business trip. Of course I'm impressed. I'm sorry. Don't be offended. I didn't mean to pick a fight. Let's talk about something else. Your gem-polishing class is on Fridays, right? Did you finish that stone you were working on? Not yet. Almost. I wonder if we see the true face of a gem when it's polished, or in the rough. - I don't want to talk about that. - Why not? I think it's a trick question. I see. Changing the subject's your prerogative. What would you like to talk about? Have you ever wondered why women wear makeup? Let's see... Isn't it to deceive men? You're way off. During the era of the Tale of Genji, women believed it was a virtue to conceal their faces. That's why poems of the time only mention their black hair. Even now in Arab countries, a woman's face still remains hidden. Makeup is also a sort of mask. It's a sign of humility. Humility? As long as a woman is a woman, her face isn't worth showing without makeup. Sounds like very roundabout sarcasm. - Sarcasm? - Isn't it? Isn't humility better than vanity? Sensible, practical, adventurous, pleasant, idealistic... - it was surprisingly hard choosing from so many facial types. I asked the nurse's opinion. Maybe I should've asked your wife too, eh? No, the honor is all yours. Bring the eyes. Well? You left the mole too? Yes, it's more lifelike with a few blemishes. Shall we try it on? You can't really get a sense of it until it's in place. Let me take off your bandages. Don't move. It fits nicely. Beautifully done. It's wonderful. It'll be hot, but please bear with it. The chemicals will gradually set. Slowly move your lips sideways. Now back. Moving your facial muscles under this heat will create the appropriate wrinkles. It's unnaturally smooth as it is. Move your mouth once more. That's fine. You're free to talk or do anything you want. Won't perspiration loosen the seal? An astringent in the adhesive contracts the sweat glands. You may feel short of breath at first, because your skin won't be able to breathe. It's hard to make a "B" sound. A slight change in your voice might be a good thing. There's one hard-and-fast rule: Never wear the mask for more than 12 hours. Any longer and your skin will suffocate. This exceeds... my wildest expectations. It's an amazing change. The face of a politician. As I thought, it looks unnatural without facial hair. What look shall we go with? - Too big. - Wasn't that one all right? Not that one. The other one. This one? Yes, that's good. It's a rather odd feeling. As if someone else has taken over. It has character, doesn't it, Doctor? The skin is only about four millimeters, even at the thickest point. Just four millimeters? Yes. It was a very delicate and precise operation. I'm still not quite used to it. It's a pleasant face, though it has a few quirks. Even changing clothes can affect a person. But I am who I am. That can't change. - Let's hope so. - What's that supposed to mean? Some juice, please. As I said at the beginning, I was reluctant to do this procedure. I was certainly curious to see the results, but I also felt it was dangerous. But you pressured me, and I had to give in. Please drink this. Practice using your lips. Take this medicine as well. - What is it? Can you drink easily? It was difficult to get down. Fine, as long as you don't spill it. Can I drink hot things? Of course. Shall I give him the injection? Yes, that's probably best. I'm feeling dizzy. Another five minutes and you'll be fine. Now, what was I saying? - What was that shot? Ah, yes, my apprehensions about the effects the mask might have on you internally. Please don't exaggerate. Does it feel like a thin pane of glass is shattering inside? I don't feel the mask is really a part of me yet. No feeling as of fresh air rushing in though an open window? I feel trapped in a hothouse. You'll feel better soon. Once you're used to the mask, you'll be a new man... - one with no records, no past. A mind invisible to the world. - I'm me! That pill... that shot... what were they? - Are they taking effect? - I feel numb. One was a narcotic, the other a sedative. I was afraid your resistance to the mask would wrinkle it unevenly. Relax. Laugh. Whistle. Yield to the mask. Accept it. - I understand. - Three minutes more. Smile for me, please. No face can go over thirty years without smiling once. You look as if you have a stomach disorder. Come on now, smile. Try! No, no, a real smile. I can't feel the wind on my face. Is that so? They say a blind man can sense obstacles from the air pressure against his face. It's as if there's something between me and the world outside. I have to be careful not to lose my footing. Give it a while. You were born less than an hour ago. You're like an infant. To your maiden voyage. Wouldn't it be more fitting to toast your remarkable creation? No need for that! Wait a minute. I see now. You're trying to evade the issue. - Evade the issue? - That's right. You're trying to ignore how the mask is agitating you. Nonsense. You're the one who's agitating me. Your manner shows you're no longer afraid of the light. You're no longer the man you were when your face was covered. - It's the drugs. - No. When the waitress brought the beer, you stared at her legs. That's a sign the mask has started asserting itself. I'm just dizzy, that's all. Everything around me seems fragmented. - Isn't that the essence of the mask? - Can't you be quiet? You feel guilty, don't you? What on earth do you want from me? For you to observe yourself honestly. That was your promise from the start: to tell me everything. I'm not hiding anything. I just wish you'd stop asking leading questions. Very well. Perhaps I was too insistent. Just don't push yourself too hard. Push myself? How? - If it becomes unbearable. - That again?
