Hey, mister... you're a Grim Reaper, aren't you? You know? It's that obvious... Did you kill Mitchan? No. Reapers don't kill anyone. We just talk to those whose death is foretold. Talk? It's our job to judge whether that life... is worthy of death. We decide if it's right for that person to die right now. Like an umpire... I guess so. Mitchan was only ten, you know. Age doesn't matter. She'd fulfilled her purpose. Do you always come to the funerals? You must be busy. Lots of people die every day. We only handle unexpected deaths. No illnesses or suicides. And we only come to funerals for children. Why? A child doesn't understand what's going on. It's a service offered only to children. Give Mitchan a flower. I can't. Shall we go? I hope Mom will be all right. Why is she crying like that? She probably wanted to be with me longer. Is that it? You don't get it, do you. 'Accuracy of Death' 'A job.' 'It's raining here, too.' Yeah. 'Your subject' 'is an office worker,' 'Female, 27.' 'Proceed or suspend' 'at your discretion.' Don't keep telling me. I know! 'Customer Service Center' - Yes... We'll send someone over. I've got weird calls yesterday. He kept calling... Yes. No, it's not designed to fall under normal use... I'm very sorry. Yes. I'm very sorry. Kazue, that complainant called again last night and requested you. Take care of him, will you? Yes. Let's hit that disco later... Sure! Go! Good night! Hello? Hello? Is that you, Ms Fujiki? My VCR remote won't work. The writing in the manual's too small to read. Read it for me. Um... Are you looking for something? Music! Music. 'Proceed' again, just like always? No. The judging starts now. You say that... but with you it's always "proceed". You're going to let her die, aren't you? Probably. Tomorrow you make contact. Sorry! What's wrong with this thing? Wait! I'll pay for dry-cleaning... That's all right. No, please... Damn this umbrella! Wait! Music! What's going on here?! Oh, I'm sorry. I like music. That's mine! What are you doing? Drying it. Three more minutes. Is this a joke? Or are you trying to pick me up? Pick you up? No, no, it's all right. You're standing. You don't need picking up. I don't mean that. Are you making fun of me? No. You have iron poor blood. On the stairs... So you helped me? I was looking for somewhere you could lay down. So we came here? There's a bench, and you can dry clothes. I'm really sorry. Here I thought you were trying to pick me up. I'm not sure what you mean by 'picking up'. You don't know about 'picking up'? There's so many new words... So have I picked you up? Don't feel that you have to. Please... This is actually the first time. I've ever been picked up. Is that so? I'm hard to look at. You are? I can see you very clearly. You're not hard to look at. No, what I mean to say is that my face... isn't very striking. I'm plain. Oh, I see. That's true. Did I say something? You're different. Mister, uh... 'Chiba'. I'm Kazue Fujiki. People scream at me, or get sarcastic. But it's an important job. If we listen, the company gives better service. But this one guy keeps calling and asking for me by name. He just gets worse and worse... calling and calling all day long. Why do you listen to him? Tell him you don't like it, and to stop asking for you. If I could do that, I'd have done it ages ago. So much for my plans for the evening. I'm sorry. Did you have plans? No. My plan was to have no plans. I see. But... sometimes in life you get days like this, don't you? Thank you for tonight. Not at all. I had a great time. I'll see him again... I won't... Keep still and this won't hurt. Aren't you cute! What are you all doing? What do you want? This isn't for you to see. But I can see it. Huh? What kind of a trip are you laying on us? Laying on you? I'm not laying on you. A comedian, huh? He's asking for it! What did you do?! Nothing. Asshole! Are you OK? Thank you. You're really strong. No, I'm not. They have iron poor blood, just like you. They'll wake up soon. Let's get out of here. I don't run much... Sorry. You're not hard to look at. When you smile, you're easy to look at. Oh... You dropped this. Thank you. Here. Do you know "tossing a coin"? "Heads" or "tails". It's a kind of fortune-telling. You decide heads means good and tails means bad. But for me... it always comes up tails. Then just say that tails means something good. Yes. But when I do that... You get heads? Yes. What do you think about death? Why do you ask? You ignore it? I think about it. There's nothing good in my life. Sometimes I want to die. I see... But... you don't have to worry. Soon you'll be at peace. Welcome. Hi. You fell for that?! Yo. It's been a while. You're judging, too? Not now. I just went to "proceed". Drunk, fell in front of a train. She was a pretty girl, too. That's a real blue sky... Look at the girl, not the sky. It's just that I've never seen blue sky. No? Yeah, it's always raining when you work. I wonder why... Don't ask me. Anyway, your subject's a woman, isn't she? You gettin' any action? Is that fun? What's wrong with some fun at the end? You want them to go in a good mood, don't you? Is that it? Sure it is! Especially with young women. I'm mourning her with this. That guy's called a 'producer'. It's the producer who makes the music good. Not the singer's voice? You'd think so, but no. It's the producer who finds the voice. Yeah? Come here... This, and this... All the same producer. Every singer he finds is a success. Then it hit me... Maybe we reapers are the producers of the final performance in someone's life. So give the girl a good time! Have this. It's "proceed", isn't it? She's only got a few more days left. Hello? Fujiki speaking... Ms Fujiki? It's me. Good. This is the right number. You're home... One moment, please. Ms Fujiki... Line 3. He asked for you. I'll bet you that's really her boyfriend or something... No way! It's me again, Ms Fujiki. The tape's stuck in my deck. Yes... There's a song I want to hear. Could you sing it for me? Perhaps I could meet you somewhere. Music? Can you sing? No! He's just harassing me. I like music. It's humanity's greatest invention. But I don't like rain. Lately it's always raining. I still can't sit outside. Still? For some reason it always rains when I work. You're a "rain man". Is that like a 'snowman'? Whenever he goes out... it always snows? That's kind of funny. It rains... It snows... There! Stop that and come on! OK. What's wrong? I'm sorry. For some reason... everyone around me dies and leaves me. When I was small... my parents were killed in a plane crash. Then the aunt and uncle who took me in died in a fire. Then my boyfriend... When am I going to see some blue sky in my life? Rain always stops. Or so they say. But I'm not so sure... Why am I always left behind? How are the subjects chosen? By lot. Laugh. It's a joke. There's too much death around her. That doesn't mean much. I know. Tomorrow's the last day. So it's "proceed"? Probably. I was near your office, thinking we might meet. But then I thought we should set a time first. He's been harassing me. Now he wants to meet me. Can't the company do something? Well, he's not threatening you or anything. We'd act if he did something... That's no help! I'm going home. Hello? Ms Kazue Fujiki? Could you come with me? There. Go in. Hey! Wait! I'm sorry... Mr Chiba! He's the guy! You're the guy? No. You're wrong. Ms Fujiki? Kazue Fujiki? Oh, it's you... I'm sorry. This whole thing is over the top. What's going on? How do you know my name? I'm sorry about this. Hi. I'm from Tyrell Records. I'm sorry you got the wrong idea. Mr Ohmachi gets these crazy ideas... and there's no stopping him. It's not crazy. I didn't want her to know who I was. - But... - Why are you here? I was worried! I'm Ohmachi. I'm a record producer. I'd like to use your voice. My voice? I've been looking for a voice like yours. He called in a complaint, and happened to hear you. Is her voice all that special? Yes. Now I've heard it, I'm sure. Real, completely unspoiled, a voice born to sing. Music... Why did you "suspend"? Shouldn't I have? You were in love with her? Nonsense. Then why? She hasn't fulfilled her purpose. Purpose? Even the greatest musicians... end up as bones, you know. Emergency Exit Hey! You OK? You're Chiba? Yeah. Why did you come out of there? You're supposed to be coming from outside. Sorry. Been waiting long? I know you've come here... but I'm sorry, I can't take you to Mr Fujita. That wasn't the deal. Look, you're working for Kuriki. He told you to find Mr Fujita. No, I came to sell Kuriki to Fujita. So take me to him. He's not "Fujita" to you, buddy. He's Mr Fujita! And this information of yours better not be bullshit. You don't get far on bullshit in this business. Akutsu here. Yes. I'm with the guy now. Rain again... Yes... But are you sure about this? OK, I'll bring him. Come on. Can I hear some music? Music? Come on! You're bad luck. Oh, shit! The subject is... 40 years old. A yakuza. Another one... How many is this? Their business is killing. So it'll be "proceed"? Probably. Boss, it's me! They've found us. Kuriki's toying with me, saying he can hit me any time. No... Mr Fujita, I'm sorry! I threw the rock! What? Sorry. There was a crow. It was weirding me out. Look at me! A stupid rock and I freak out. Hey... who's that? Hey, you with the beer! This is Chiba. Oh, it's you? Sit down. I've seen these. What are you doing? Put it down! It's nice. It hasn't been fired. I don't like gunplay. So you know where Kuriki is? Why do you want to know? To kill him, of course. He'll die one day anyway. Do you need to kill him now? Yeah. He's out of line. That's all the reason I need. Kuriki... When did you get a conscience? This is how it's done. Using kids to push drugs... Don't sell the kids short. They're good workers. It's your boss who told us to. You can't come telling me to stop now. Boss! Boss! Boss! Boss! Mr Nanami won't rest if we don't... take revenge. So hurry up and tell us where he is! Will revenge make Mr Nanami happy? Damn right! How do you know for sure a dead man is happy? Isn't it you it'll make happy? Why, you... Settle down, Akutsu! You're soaking wet! Go get a shower. Go. Revenge isn't for the dead. It's for those left alive. Where did you hear that? Sit down. Thanks. Torazo Katsuta, the old Godfather, used to say that. Yeah, that was his name. He told me that. He died 30 years ago. You were still a kid with a runny nose then. "Runny"? Can a nose run? You're a funny guy. Tell me... what do you think about death? Why? I'm not afraid of dying. Mr Chiba, a yakuza... goes on reflexes, not brains. If he can't toe the line, he's better off dead. Good. It's a relief to hear that. You get it, don't you? Lately there's lots who don't toe the line. What about you? I wouldn't have lasted 20 years as a yakuza if I hadn't. You're an informant. Just tell me what I want to know. That's all you need to do. I'm going out for a minute. What for? Cigarettes. OK. Get going. Don't go getting cold feet. If you can't do the job, you're no use to us. I understand. Hang in for two more days. We're counting on you. Who said you could use that?! Where are you going?! Kuriki's. Wait a minute! You can't trust him! You brought him. I trust you. So it's information you brought. Wait! Please, Mr Fujita! Wait! Yes, Boss? Yes... Yes... Yes... Wait a minute! You mean you're cutting a deal with him?! No! But that means we're the ones out of line. "The bottom line"? "Profit against loss"? What kind of yakuza is that?! That damn fool! Mr Fujita, no! He said to stay here, didn't he? You of all people should know I won't take that. - Move! - Yeah, but... What? He could be lying to you! It's the truth. Chiba, you shut up! I'll go check if he's really there. There'll still be time. Please! Wait a bit longer. Please! Is that it? Yeah. Lots of guards. Yeah! How many are there? That's how much Mr Fujita scares them. There he is! Looks like he's got some new heavies. Look... The wise-ass one with glasses. The bastard! Damn. We're going. Here's Kazue Fujiki with "Sunny Day"... Keep your hands off that! This is no time for music! I want to hear music. I hate music! Then what's this for? Shut up! We're going. Damn! Won't Fujita be waiting for us? Just shut up, will you? What'll happen if we go back and tell him Kuriki was there? He's bound to go after him. He'll go busting in there alone. We can't let him do that. It's your turn. Even Mr Fujita can't take on all those guys by himself. Wow! You're good! Act a little happier. Mr Chiba, do me a favor. Let on that Kuriki wasn't there. Why? If we have our stories straight, Mr Fujita won't get killed. OK? Please! Please! Hey, Chiba. What happened? You fell asleep. Have you been staying out too late? Yeah? About what I said... OK? We can't let Mr Fujita go. We can't let him die! No one doesn't die. That's not what I'm saying. Listen... Mr Fujita treats a punk like me like a real little brother. What happens to me... if he's gone? I win. Hey, are you listening to me?! It sounds like you don't have faith in Fujita. Sure I do! Fuck off! Gone? Yes. We watched all night. Sorry. I see... Akutsu, go do some laundry. I'm out of clean clothes. All right. Kuriki was there, wasn't he? Yeah. I knew it! Akutsu's a lousy liar. He doesn't want you dead. I worry about him. There's no future anywhere for someone who can't lie. His father died when he was small, and his mother abandoned him. He grew up alone. Is she still alive? Don't know. She was a singer. A singer? Yeah. She retired years ago. I don't know if she's alive. Neither does he. Mr Chiba, tell him for me that you die the way you've lived. That the way you die says how you've lived. Tell him to walk the line and live like there's no tomorrow. I'm no carrier pigeon. You tell him. I'd feel like an idiot saying that. Kuriki's? No. His hideout doesn't matter now. My boss called. Tomorrow they're meeting Kuriki. He'll be alone. I'm inviting myself. Thanks for your help, Mr Chiba. That's tomorrow. Where are you going now? I've got something to do. A woman... Nothing gets by you, does it? One last thing... Do you have faith in yourself? Yeah, I have faith in myself. I always have high expectations for myself. Akutsu, are you keeping an eye on Fujita? Yes. It goes down tomorrow. We told him there's a meeting. Don't you go pulling anything stupid. You're really going to? Stop being so hung up on "Mr Fujita". He's past it, understand? What's happening with your subject? He says if you can't walk the line, you're better off dead. So it's "proceed", then? The punk doesn't want him dead. So this is sympathy? Probably. Chiba! The truth! If Fujita goes up against Kuriki, will he get done? You mean "die"? Yeah! No one doesn't die. How do you know that? There might be one! He is Mr Fujita. Come on! I'll get Kuriki. Why you? They sold out Mr Fujita. There's no meeting tomorrow. They know he'll come. It's a trap. He knows that. Watch the road. You die before he does. Shit! That's right. I'm scum! But I'm through betraying Mr Fujita. We can still save him. Can't we! Just one thing... Am I coming? You ever hear "in the same boat"? Yeah. Come on. Talk or I put a hole in your throat. Then you'll Whistle when you breathe. Whistle. Well, I like music. Chiba! Don't tell them! Shut up! So that's the truth? Yeah. I let Mr Fujita get away. Tough shit. Call him here. That won't bring him! He's the old-fashioned type. He'll come for his little brother. He knows I sold him out. He won't come! Let's see. Tell me his number. Like hell I will! 090-9818-901 What? What did you say? His number. Chiba, shut up! Shut up! Again... 090-9818 You traitor! Shut up! 090-9818-901 Don't worry. He'll come for you. You idiot. I know he would come for me. I know. But when he does, they'll kill him! You simply lack faith in Fujita. Wait, Boss. Mr. Fujita. Mr. Fujita. - No! - It's been a while. There's five men in here, and four out front! We're partying down with your little brother. No! Stay away! Don't worry about me! The same place. Mind your manners. Keep quiet when I'm on the phone. Mr Fujita's coming alone. Let's get prepared. Boss... Akutsu, don't worry. It's not Fujita who'll die here. Mr Fujita! I'm sorry! It's OK. OK. - Thank you! - Wait. - It's OK. Get up. - Sorry about that. It's OK. Yeah. You OK? OK? It's OK. A car accident? Is that a good death? A good death. Why, when he could have gone out in a blaze of glory? He'd met his expectations. He'd fulfilled his purpose, so I went to "proceed". What about the young guy? He'll live like there's no tomorrow. All right. The day after tomorrow, then? Handle it however you want. Bye. Robot User's Manual Good morning, Missus! Great! It's been ages, Takeko. Yes, it has. She's working fine. Let us know if there are any problems. Thank you. Subject is a hairdresser, 70. An old lady? That's rare. Are you open? Welcome. A haircut? Yes. So what are you here for? A haircut. Anything else? I want to draw the scenery from here. Well, it certainly is a good view. Marvelous. But surely not in the rain. Well, I've never seen a real blue sky. Is that possible? I'll wash your hair. You're a Grim Reaper, aren't you? You don't deny it. Most people would say something. "Don't be silly," they'd say. But you stay silent. So I'm right. I've met people like you. There was a man I lived with once. When he died I had the feeling there was someone Near other-worldly, like you. That guy took him away, right? Did you cut his hair? I wasn't doing this then. I don't know why... but everyone I love seems to die in an accident. So I'm used to people like you. Your whole family? Yep. Except for my son. He still seems to be alive. But I won't see him again. Why not? I abandoned him as a child. He hates me. Takeko? Masashi! Hello! It's been years! Yes! There's someone ahead of you. It's been a long time since that happened! You've grown! Yeah? You're a lot bigger. Where's your son now? I don't know. It doesn't matter... as long as he's all right. Still, I'd like to see him once before I die. Is that a last wish? That must mean... I'm going to die. Your haircut's done. Why are you still here? I have to see something. You mean the sea? It's different here. A photographer said that 732 days ago. What do you do? The Grim Reaper! That Grim Reaper card is really rare. Be careful. What's the sickle for? Hmm... You're all done. Thanks! Takeko, it's raining. Will you see me home? Sure. Is that all right? Yes. Go with him. Great! You come, too! Come into town with us. All right. Is there music there? Music? I still haven't paid you. I don't need your money. But could I ask you a favor instead? What? Get me some customers. - Customers? - Yes. Some boys about 7 years old, who I've never seen before. Get them to promise they'll come the day after tomorrow. In two days... Yes. But not with their mothers. Only the children. They should come together. Why should I do that? Why not? Just bring them. Surely a god can make one wish come true? I'm not a god. Thanks. You're welcome Tell me, is there a school around here? What are we doing today? Soccer, I hope. Why? What else then? Hey... Do you guys want to get your hair cut? In two days, at a salon by the sea. Way out there? Forget it! - Who is this guy? - Weirdo! Come on! Go catch the frogs! Yeah! And earthworms. Come get your hair cut... Come get your hair cut... And now, turning to sports... The Soccer World Cup, last held here in 2002 in Japan. It returns to Japan after 24 years. The Japan line-up was announced today. How did it go? Kids don't seem to like me. Nobody likes you! Except for crows. Tell me, what do you think about death? Why do you ask? That question seems familiar, somehow. - Forget that stuff. - "Stuff"? Get me those kids. But about death... This is the last wish of my life. Beware of this man! What are you doing? How do you get a bunch of kids together? Your missus told me to. I wonder why... For a free haircut. Maybe for practice? No, not at her age. Kids... Hello. How did it go? I did what I could. You did? Thanks. Could you tell me what you want them for? Surely I can keep one secret from you? It really has to be a secret? Well, it's not nice to ask you and not tell you why. I'll tell you when I'm done. Tell me, what do you think about death? That's my line. Answer me, anyway. Death is nothing special. Death is nothing special. Everyone dies someday, so it's not special at all. But that's easy for you to say. I mean... you see lots of people as they die. But you don't see any of them as they live. So you don't really know life. That's the reason you can say death is nothing special. Is life special? Against the whole world or all of history... one life is nothing special. But... for those of us living it, it's very important. Not special, but important? Yes. The sun in the sky is nothing unusual. But it's important that it be there. Death's like that, maybe. I'm sorry, but I've never seen a blue sky. That's right. So that's not a good example. I'm confusing you. That's kind of fun. She's running you around in circles. I'm tired. Why does she want kids? Dunno. She says it's her last wish. Her last wish? Then we can go to "proceed"? Probably. Can we get the card? Yeah. It's worth it. Yeah. This is the card. You've got this. I've got this one. Let me see. And this one. Give it to me. You see. Thanks for coming in this rain. It's worth it. That man said he'd give me a rare card. A card? This one. Soon I'll have the whole set. Oh... So that's it! Give me my card! There. Thanks! Thank you. The Grim Reaper! Thanks! I've never seen this one! Thanks! Excuse me... Coming! Yes? Is this enough? Children are free today. Didn't that man bring you? Who? Didn't you come to get a "Grim Reaper" card? No. Can I get one? Sure! Thank you! It's OK? Great! Thanks! Thank you. - Hello. - Hi. Today they said it was free. And I got a card! Is that why we came here? That's right. Great. Your hair looks good. Let's go. Akutsu Box Lunches It's still early. Should you be closing already? That's enough. It's been ages since I was this tired. But why all those kids today? My son called me the other day. The one you've lived apart from? Yes. And... he said I have a grandson who's almost 7. A grandson... My son said he wanted me to meet this grandson. But I said no. Why? I was afraid. So I said, "I don't want to see you." And he said, "It's all right if you don't see me. "But "at least meet your grandson." I said he could come as a customer... but only on condition he wasn't told that I was... his grandmother. Why not? Well, if I knew the boy was my grandson... I'd go all to pieces. How would that make the boy feel? So those kids were to stop you knowing who he was... Everyone I love dies. My parents, when I was small, then the couple who raised me... When my fiance was killed, I lost hope. I wanted to kill myself. But then, by some twist of fate, I became a singer. At last I had a life. When I got married and had a baby... I thought then I'd be truly happy. But that didn't last. My husband up and died... and I took it into my head that I'd abandon everything. "I'll never love again," I said. And so I abandoned my son. There was one boy who wanted to pay. Oh? There was, was there? You knew which one he was, didn't you. I didn't. Let's leave it at that. Today was a busy day, but it was fun. Where are you going? For a walk. Don't you get the feeling it's going to clear up? That won't happen. Do you play this a lot? She likes to listen to it when she's alone. Beautiful... So you can see that, can you? I've never seen it before. It really is blue. Yes. It's beautiful. So this is what the ordinary and not-special looks like? Yes. But it's very, very important. Yes. Not hard to look at. We meet again... Mr Chiba... was it right that I lived this long? Yes, I guess so... It was? Then I leave no regrets. I leave no regrets. I can die any time. Don't say that! That means there's no need for me. Eat your heart out.
