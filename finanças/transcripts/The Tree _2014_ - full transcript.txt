THE TREE Leave the curtain alone. Do you hear me? Veli, get away from the window! One, two, three, four... Go into the house. Go on. - Veli, wait. - Where's my squirt gun? - I brought you something else. - What? -Come on. Can I see? It's nice. And one and two and three and four and five and six. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. Veil! I was gonna give it back. Did I say anything? Come on, let's go in. Go get dressed. Veli? - Why are you not sleeping? - I was hungry. - Let's go find something in the kitchen. - I already did. - Shall I tell you a story? - Yes. In the middle of a vast plain there stood a house. It stood there for many years. Until time vanished from it. A boy living in the house wanted to find it. He counted everything he could. One, two, three... Every day was just one day and one night. The boy was always the same age. He couldn't count his time. So he decided to go find it. Can I take the knife? No, I need it. - What will you do with it? - I will cut the twigs. Here. Just be careful. Can I come in bed with you? - Are you scared? - Nah. Do you think daddy would like my forest? I can't wait for trees to grow. What about Dritan? Is he with our daddy now? Are you asleep? Why are you putting clothes back in the wardrobe? So they will be nice when we leave. What if can't leave again? Soon. We will go soon. - Will we be nicely dressed at the party? - Yes. - What day is it today? - It's Friday. And the date? Is there anybody else who could talk to them? - Stupid trees. - They will grow. - Why don't we have any tasks? - What tasks? With this game. We are just hiding in this crappy fortress. What if we attacked the ones on the other side of the wall? Listen. You can never go out. If you do the game is over. So what? I want to climb the tree anyway. - You will climb the tree later. - When? Well? When? - What have you done? - What have you done? Let it go! Stop it! Enough! Stop it! - Liars! - What are you talking about? There will be no party. No cake. No tree. Veli, there will be a party. I will make you the best cake. Now I'm nine! - Alek. - What? - Would you read to me? - Why don't you read yourself? - I want you to read to me. - Are you so lazy? No, it's not that. I feel better if you read to me. Come on. Far away in the distant horizon in the sky there is a fortress. - The wind is playing with white flags. - Not from the beginning. From the warriors. The fortress was unreachable for everyone, friends or enemies alike. Only the flying beings living in it could reach it. The winged warriors had big swords, axes and shields. They had shiny armour. No one could equal their might until they got a mighty enemy, the Green Arrow Clan. Alek! Where's Veil? We've arranged transport for the weekend. Don't worry, mum. Yes, we will continue by train. Yes, soon. Home. Let's go back. Have you turned into a stone? Come on. Piggyback! - Hello, Liri. - Hello, Liri. - Hello. Liri will go with us. No need. It's not heavy. One nil for you. - Does this count? - No. You know it was supposed to be just for two months. It's different now. - We will stay there. - What do you mean stay? - We're moving. - How can you move just like that? Mum think it will be easier for us there now dad is gone. - So we're not here alone. - Alone? You have me. - Why don't just she and Veli go? - She wouldn't let me stay here. Oh, don't be such a wimp. You always do what she says. - Don't be such a baby. You're not Veli. - Don't you get it? - I can't let them go alone. - Alek! Oh, come on, Veli, we agreed you will not wear just socks. Yet you are. No wonder my bed is full of sand. Go back now. Let's go! Look. And my brother is frantically looking for it. Let's see. - He'll kill you, man. - Kill? Me? When I tell him about you and Liri, you'll be the dead one. You know him. He's like a crazy animal when he's mad. - It doesn't matter now. - What doesn't? The thing with Liri. Maybe you'll return here. And when you do, you'll bring somebody else. You're just like your father. You don't get it, do you? This is my sister we're talking about. You only have two choices. Either you're serious or you're not thinking at all. Alek, talk to me. What happened? Did he fall? I told them you didn't push him. But they want revenge anyway. So they say. Don't go out. Both of you. They can't just do this. They can't just kill us. It was an accident. And why Veli? He's got nothing to do with it. He's your brother. Listen to me. - Nobody goes out. - Never? Out of your room? We'll stay at home until the car comes to take us to the city. - When will it come? - Soon. - Can you come closer to the door? - I'll help you with baggage. Please. Closer to the door. Is your husband in the house? - He's dead. - Who's in the house? The children. Two sons. I'm sorry. This is between you and them. Veli. We're not going today. We'll wait for another cab, ok? Stop it. It's not your fault. I could stay here alone. No. That wouldn't solve anything. What about Liri? Did you see her? Alek? I asked everybody. They all say there's nothing they can do. The police... Nobody can help. What will we do? Here. I don't feel like it anymore. - I just finished. - What? - This. It's for you. - For me? Go. Why don't you leave? You know why. Wherever I go, they will find me. And Veli. - Let's go inside. - Can I show you something? Yes. Where did you find it? Go to the room. I'll come later, all right?
