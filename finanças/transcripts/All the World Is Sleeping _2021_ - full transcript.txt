[indistinct] [indistinct ruminating] [Chama] Play the same song over and over. I stuck a needle in my veins. My sister listened to me. My sister wouldn't ask if I came home. Abuelo used to say that if you find a black feather... it's a warning. [woman] Come on, come on, we don't have much time. [Chama] I love you. I love you, I love you. [indistinct ruminating] -[Santi grunts] -[screaming] [Toaster] Where are you going, Chama? You broke it! [Chama] I am my mother's lost sisters.

You find what it is you were looking for? -Don't be like that. -Like what, Chama? Like your mother? What else have you got? Your Abuelo used to say, "I don't need a watch-- I got the river." If you leave... I don't ever want to see you again. [Chama] I wish I would've put my arms around you. One last time. I wish I would have held you, felt you, smelled that lipstick. I wish I would have been home when they found you. I hated you. I blamed you. I skipped your funeral and Mari hated me. But I pretend in that last moment... you saw something beautiful. [Nell] I used to be married. He's famous, I can't tell you who it was. [Chama] Okay. I was independent though. Yeah, I loved to work. I ran five restaurants. I mean, most people only, like, oversee one. Wanna know how many I ran? -[Chama] Five? -Five! Yeah, they respected me. You know, like... I wasn't a bitch to them or anything if that's what you're thinking, but I was the boss. You should see the way they looked at me when I walked into a Chili's. [Chama] Nell likes to talk. -[Nell speaking indistinctly] -[Chama] A lot. She says she first tried heroin at age ten. Given to her by a neighbor. She told her father, who went to her and beat her. She started cutting her knuckles in high school, but her sister found out and threw away the razors. All her friends worked at a local Chili's. Nell claims she did, too. She goes on and on and on about it. I just want to scrub a toilet in peace. Yeah, I don't really like Chili's. Oh, you're one of those... Applebee's motherfuckers? [Nell chuckles] Anyways I was doing really well, you know? My husband was like... [rhythmic vibration] [snoring] [rhythmic vibration continues] [snoring] Okay, let's check in. It's a cloudy day out there today. What's that make everyone think of? [siren wailing in distance] Rain. Makes me think of my son playing in the puddles. [Lucy] Sweaters. I hate t-shirts and short pants. How about you, Gata? Go fuck yourself. That's what my ma used to always say. Clouds remind me of her. Every time I'd mess up... like, when she'd catch me slipping. "Great... go fuck yourself, Gata." First time I came here, -Nick suggested that I say-- -Go love yourself. Yeah, so now... when I think about my ma... it's like... Go love yourself, Gata. Go love yourself back. [Nick sighs] Ow! [car horns honking] Well, I did it, because I wanted to. Um... I climbed out of the second story window at my parents' house and, um, I jumped. [chuckles] Probably broke, like, two bones. [clears throat] But, you know, he was-- he was older, uh... he liked me, uh, everyone liked me. [chuckles] And, um, I wanted to see him. So, yeah, we got a little strung out... and, uh... well, I woke up in a trailer with four men... that I didn't know. I don't even think they knew my name. [Nell laughs] I had to take Clonazepam, so I wouldn't get seizures. But one night after my husband got rough... I took too many and OD'd. This spark plug is fried. [Gata] I got arrested in middle school. Sent to Las Nunes. He ordered a youth diagnostic. I spent Christmas in jail. When I got out of the hospital... the doctor... prescribed me Clonazepam. [Gata] But I liked jail. No one was gonna molest me there. [Shorty] People always ask what's your favorite number. I always thought that was a dumbass question.
