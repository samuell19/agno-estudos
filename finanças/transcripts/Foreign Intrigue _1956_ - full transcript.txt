Dannemora the doctor was curious as to why you should want official certification oh well I don't imagine it makes any difference if you know now also I was not to speak of it during mr. de nemours life I understand what is it exactly mr. de Namur entrusted me with a sealed document and instruction set in the event of his death I was to obtain official certification of the cause of the death and if this cause was normal or natural I was to destroy his document and open it and under it and if the death was not natural I was to open it and follow instructions contained therein oh no no no I holding it until such time as I had received certification I asked for eight years mr. Mannheim don't destroy that document why I say anything wrong about no no there's nothing wrong there's a plane leaving here tomorrow afternoon that arrives in Vienna at 7:30 p. m.

Vishal yes I will put her on how do you stay yes of course I understand I baked for you know day I'll wait for you you see your room he's dropping everything we are not having lunch together because you see the cable from a friend of his in Vienna it's urgent business and his location explain you don't have to lightly nor do you have to tell him anything he's coming back kisses when he finishes it means it's too late he has another lead to another man there's three other men and none of them are dead perhaps he will forget us forget you until he has broken one of the others and then he'll be back and there won't be any point in lying to him then you know everything there is to know what are you going to do stop him I'm going to offer him a partnership a full and complete partnership if it isn't accepted did you know she would offer him a partnership and if he didn't accept but it means you would stop me I was a grantee listen to me Becca I won't let you make this: I won't let you destroy what I helped be had yes what have you built you said my father was a liar on a tray yes he was but only we know that how can you say that who is that woman that woman either wife or Victor and then more she's taken his place I will not be blackmailed as your father was pay as he paid it I will stop anyone from revealing visit and me ghost you hello I'd like the number of the Grand Hotel yes hurry please yes 1-0 hello hello hello LM flight 1 for 2 that leaves at 6 o'clock and that arrives in Vienna at two o'clock in the morning and one of these at midnight will you please send the ticket to the Castle Hotel this is done if Tony Forrest information is as complete as his cable indicates he may have some reservation about giving it to you it trusts me that's good it's nice to have trust between friends it's good for friendship like I trust you I told you I'd like to deal with I know I knew you would there's so much money involved right just one thing yes I find the Lindquist family is out no matter what we find oh the girl you spoke to on the phone they're out he's dead and there are others we can afford to be generous you will be going directly to the hotel yes Tony I'll be expecting you that I think the best thing would be if we separate here when you have the information we both need call me at this number all right how long will you be there I'll be there until I hear from you or until I don't just another word of course the aura I received and ignored can be given to others first you and now we are gambling for very high stakes and we must be extremely cautious we must meet cautiously and we must travel cautiously I'm inclined to rely on your judgment in such cases the first mark of the talented amateur is that he respects the professional Wow don't turn mr. Bishop just listen to me who are you I'm the man who sent the cable that brought return will sign your friends name to it why I can explain better as we ride he's entered a sedan parked on your right well if you're not threatening me I have nothing to lose by riding with you if you are I have no choice save you the trouble of an explanation get in P what I didn't do down here I'm just a tourist Pierre Sanders swiss counterintelligence what is this not a very long drive hello air terminal there was a plane that left for Vienna unknown today I want to know if I can get a message to someone on that plane when it arrives it has arrived wait is there a plane tonight reserved a seat for me may I introduce mr. Smith American intelligence mr. brown a British CID and mr.

Bishop yes thanks cigarette nice Maltese this meeting was call rather suddenly mr. Bishop and we haven't decided who should explain why yesterday I don't know I guess I'm a great car for talking I probably need this often picked up at the airport friend yeah everything go well I don't know how well it's gone but I'm here that's actually perfectly yes you're here and you want to know why exactly you're here mr. Bishop because for seven years you work for Victor Danimal because you went to Vienna because you spoke to mr. spring because you were almost accused of the murder mr. Mannheim because you went to Stockholm and spoke to the family Lindquist yeah because you answered the cable we took the liberty of sending how long have I been watched since you first met mr. Santos and the travel agency on the Riviera why because you wanted to know who Victor de Namur was story of Victor del amor mr. Bishop is a saga of our times it is the story the true story the world forgot then the story isn't finished yet it started way back in 1938 with a man who planned to conquer the world and then called little Hitler in 1938 one year before his armies moved he took his first step towards war no one knew it at the time but in 1938 he made a conflict with a man in each country he planned to invade and then who was welfare a man who was powerful and then who would sell his country for more power and he selected well you understand mr. Bishop this men were to do nothing and did nothing until Hitler's armies into that country but at that point these men became the rulers the Gauleiters of their country in Norway it was Quisling in France it was there in how and was it in Belgium Degrelle these are the men who made the deals the men the world knows and talks about but there are four men the world doesn't know from the world's forgotten the men who remained unknown because Hitler failed to conquer Iran mr. Bishop in your country the United States man in my country England a man in Switzerland a man in Sweden these men who waited for Hitler's armies were left behind were forgotten but they still exist and these are the moment denim or blackmail yes the four forgotten men of our times the men who proved in a preoccupied country of the world that they could throw their nations into confusion delay command decisions drive pitted against patriot this is the true efficient instrument of modern warfare not a new bomb that can destroy more than an old bomb but a group of men who can stop a bomb who can turn a cannon and these men remain today waiting as they waited before how long have you known as these men exist if all this meant every intelligence agency in the world never know who these men were but we always know they existed we never stop searching our first break king a new love linguist committed suicide yes he committed suicide they permitted mrs. link with to conceal this fact we never told her why but we ourselves did not want this information revealed linguist with the only step ahead it took five years of the most intensive investigation before we were able to discover a connection between linguist and anymore unfortunately I arrived too late and so you started watching me not really you mr. Bishop but the man who was watching you spring we had hoped that one of the men denim or blackmailed good luck resist the temptation of sending an invoice whilst Christians to find out if his hidden identity it was in jeopardy and mr. spree appeared and that's why I'm here you now know what mr.
