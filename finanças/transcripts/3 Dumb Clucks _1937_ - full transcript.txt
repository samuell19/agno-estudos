[♪] [CURLY HUMMING] Why is it every spring we work ourselves to death in this place? I don't know. Didn't you guys ever hear of spring cleaning? Yeah, it wouldn't be so bad if we didn't have to wash all our clothes. Here, wash these socks. More work. Mmm! Hey, you guys, here's a letter for you. MOE: "My darling babies, "your father has made millions off that old oil land "and has divorced me for a blond whom he's going to marry. "You must get out and stop the wedding. "I want him back. Love, Mama." We gotta get outta here and stop the old man. Think of something. Oh! Ooh! I got an idea in back of my head. Well, bring it out front. Oh-oh-oh! What is it? You knocked it clear out. I thought of something. What? The tools. What tools? The tools we've been using for the last 10 years. MOE & CURLY: Oh, those tools. Yeah. Come on, get busy. Get up there and get to work. What's the matter? It's stuck. Let me see. [SQUEAKS] What happened to you? What happened to me is gonna happen to you. It's a good thing they got an electric chair in this building, otherwise I'd kill you. Go on. Give him a hand. [CLANGS ON FLOOR] Shh. Shh. What's going on in here? What's going on in here? Termites. Termites? I'll report 'em. Come on, fellas. Give me a lift. Oh! Hey, this is too small or I'm too big. Get down out of there. Come on. We'll try the wall. Wait a minute. You get busy with that. Hmm! Nyuck, nyuck, nyuck. Where are we gonna plug it in? Where's my razor? Under the mattress. Give me that plug. Hey, warden. Hey, keeper. Oh, hello. Say, would you plug that in for me, please? I wanna take a shave. I guess it's all right. Sure. Best razor I ever used. Let you try it sometime. [GRUNTS DELIGHTEDLY] [DRILL STOPS] Stopped up. [DRILL STARTS] [CACKLES] What you need is a hacksaw. No, we tried that, but that window's-- Oof! Imagine. A hacksaw in jail. [LAUGHS] Whew. How are we gonna get that out? Use your head, dummy. Wait a minute. Give me a hand. MOE: We'll use your head. Come on. MOE & LARRY: One, two, three! LARRY: Oh! That's the old man's joint, all right. Yeah, they got him behind bars too. You got your razor? Hey, warden. Hey, keeper. What's the matter? This is no jail. How are we gonna get in? Use your head. I got it. If I only had a hammer. Hammer? Nyuck, nyuck, nyuck. Oh, boy. Mmm! Give it all you've got. Mmm. Good one. Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh, look. It's open. Yeah, look what you did to my hand. Oh! Oh! Oh, oh, oh. Yeah, come on. We got work to do. Look. There's Pop now. And there's the girl he's gonna marry. [GIGGLING] Popsie, you say the cutest things. Nyuck, nyuck, nyuck, nyuck. And I got the marriage license too, Daisy-Waisy. Better let me take it, Popsie. You're so forgetful, you know. All right, my love. Yes, sweetie. Hmm, Popsie, why don't you have those nasty old sideburns shaved off. Oh, not that. Oh, please, Popsie. They tickle your little baby. All right. For you I will, Daisy-Waisy. Well, I better be going. Sorry I can't stay for lunch. Me too. Now, don't forget 3:00. Peek in there. See if anybody's watching. Watching? No. Oh! Come on. Come on. Get up outta there. Hiya, Pop. Hiya, Dad. Hmm, food. Wait a minute. Can't you wait till we're all ready? Go! Low man again. Say, what's the meaning of this. What are you doing here? Ma sent us to keep you from marrying that blond. And I aim to do it too. That's what I aim to do. I aim. Nyuck, nyuck, nyuck. Quiet. [GRUNTS] [BARKS] [MUFFLED BARK] Hmm. Now, you boys be nice and I'll let you come to my wedding this afternoon. Here's some money. Go get yourself some new clothes. Nothing doing. We ain't gonna let you marry her. You can't bribe me. Me neither. Me too. Give it back. [GROANS] You would, eh? Now there's three nice, smart boys. Ooh! Get outta here! Whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo! [GROWLS] Whoo! Whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo. Now all you need is a new hat. [GRUNTS DELIGHTEDLY] Hmm. Well, that's nice. Let me see it from the back. Get out. [YODELS] Oh, oh. How about this one? That's it. Why didn't you show us that before? I didn't know we had it. How much do we owe you? How'd you make out, baby? Well, we got the marriage license and the wedding's set for 3:00. Ah, that's great. Chopper and I decided to have the wedding up here at the penthouse. Yeah, because it wouldn't be polite to give the guy the works in his own joint. Especially on his wedding day. It's all right by me. I'll bring him up here then. [CHUCKLES] Attagirl. When it's all over, you and I will go to Europe and spend the old guy's dough, huh, baby? Try to act dignified. Hiya, toots. Hey, get rid of that hat. Get rid of that hat. Not this one! [TIRES SCREECH] Mmm. Why, Popsie, darling. That's the girl that Dad's gonna marry. She thinks he's Pa. Popsie, you look 20 years younger without your sideburns. Whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo. Oh, what luck finding you here. I was just coming to get you. You know we're having the wedding in my brother's penthouse. I can't wait till you marry him. Come on, let's go. Room for everybody. Don't crowd. Come on, lady, hurry up. Whoa! Hiya, kid. Go ahead. [LAUGHS] Hello, folks. Enjoy yourself. Don't stiffen up on us now. [BLOWS] What's the matter with you? Now, take it easy. Don't get excited, kid. Look at me, I'm as calm as a cucumber. What are you shaking about? I don't know. I'm in a hurry all over. A guy that's gonna get married should have a drink. Fix him up a drink. Mix him a sarsaparilla frapini. Won't Ma be tickled when she hears we broke up the wedding? But won't Pa sizzle when he finds out you married his girl. She's supposed to be his wife but now she's gonna be his daughter. Nyuck, nyuck, nyuck, nyuck. He'll tear your tonsils out. Shake this up. Thanks. [CLEARS THROAT] Hey, it sounds like it's done. Let me see it. We sure mixed it, didn't we? [CHUCKLES] Yeah. What's the matter with you? Put back them silver muglets. But I didn't-- You didn't have. Put 'em back. Oh! Oh! [GRUNTS] Yeah. [LAUGHS] Whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo. Yeah. Oh! Oh. Mmm! MAN 1: Wait a minute. You know what to do. MAN 2: Sure. As soon as this mug marries Daisy, we'll polish him off. Yeah, but we can't shoot him. That would make too much noise. Do you think they mean me? They don't mean me. Me either. MAN 2: How about choking him? [COUGHS] MAN 1: No. That'll leave fingerprints. I got it. As soon as they get married, we dump him out of a window. He falls 14 stories and it looks like an accident. MAN 2: Great. That guy thinks of everything. I'm glad they made up their mind. They had me worried. I'm still worried. Wait a minute. Where you going? After the thin man. Hiya, Pop. Come on, Popsie-Wopsie. We're ready for the wedding. I changed my mind. I don't want to be married. That's what you think. You're gonna marry her right now. I'll marry her when I'm ready. Are you ready? Yeah, I'm ready. How do I look? You look much younger, Mr. Howard, without your sideburns. Thanks. I wonder what's keeping my Daisy-Waisy. Just a moment. Mr. Howard. Hello, is Daisy there? Yeah, but she can't come to the phone. She's busy getting married to old man Howard. Thanks. I'll call later. Married? Wait. Hello, hello. You can't do that. I ain't there. I'm here, but I'll be right over. Whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo. I now pronounce you man and wife until death do you part. Whoo! Oh, he's fainted. Give him some air. Bring him over by the open window. No, not the window. [WHIMPERS] He passed out again. Speak to me, kid. Say something. Come on kid, please say something. Something. Oh! He's all right, folks. Come on, everybody. Let's have a drink. That's a good idea. We can't throw that guy out the window with all those people in there. Hey, let's dump him down the elevator shaft. Daisy-Waisy you can't get married without me. Let's go get him. Say, where you been? I'm looking for my Daisy-Waisy. Oh, Daisy's waiting for you downstairs. Oh, I better go down then. You said it. No! [CRASH] Where are you going? Upstairs. [GROANS] That's that. Yeah. Ha, ha. Nyah-ah, whoo! There he is again. Come on we'll head him off with the elevator. Nyah-ah-ah! Say, are we drunk? [BARKS] Whoo-whoo-whoo. Whoo! Come on. Nyah-ah-ah! Nyah-ah-ah! That guy must be twins. [BARKS] [BARKS] [YELLS] Whoo-whoo-whoo. Whoo-whoo-whoo. [DOOR SLAMS] They locked it! Open this door, somebody. Success. Whoo-whoo-whoo. They're after me. We've gotta get outta here. Whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo. Trying to do me bodily harm, eh? I'll call a policeman, I think. Whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo. Whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo. Whoo. Mmm! Oh! Ah! What's the matter with you? We're caught. Up the pole. Hurry up. They'll catch us. Let us in here! MOE: Faster. I'm going as fast as I can. MOE: Go on higher, higher. Get that door open. WOMAN: Hey, what's going on here? [CURLY GROANS] Got room for me up there? They asked for it, let's give it to 'em. Come on. Gimme a hand. MOE: Take it easy. Whoa! CURLY: Get away from me. CURLY: Whoa! Whoo-whoo-whoo. LARRY: My hand. MOE: Take it easy. [STOOGES YELLING] Oh! Whoa! Whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo! [STOOGES CONTINUE YELLING] Spread out! What are you crowding for? Happy landings. [STOOGES YELL] [STOOGES YELL] What's the idea of getting in our way? What's the matter with you? Hey, look! It's Pop. Come on! Take him home to Ma. Come on! [♪]
