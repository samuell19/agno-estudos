[music playing] [electrical sizzle] Revenge is best served cold. How long has it been since I felt the warmth of the sun, trapped here on this dying planet, no conquest, no terrified screams, no fun. It has been too long. Chamberlain! You called, my Lord? Tell me of your progress for getting us off this rock. Everything is ready, my Lord. There is one faction that might pose a problem to us, The Planet Patrol. Let nothing stop us in our quest for warmth. [lightning crackles] [music playing] Welcome aboard, Curtis. So, this is your first assignment. Yes, sir. I want to take this opportunity to introduce you to the other members of our team-- Lieutenant Abel, our engineer. Hey, kid. Patrolman Garth. What's up? [clears throat] This is a remote outpost, Curtis. And things are usually pretty quiet around here. But that doesn't mean we take our responsibilities for granted. No, sir. According to your file, you're designated as a double P specialist. Yes, sir. Curtis, what is a double P specialist? Psychic powers, sir. Psychic powers? Yes, sir-- telepathy, telekinesis, quantum manipulation, mind control. And you can do all that? Sometimes. I'm afraid it's not all that reliable. Tell me what I'm thinking right now. That you don't believe I have any psychic powers. Ah, too easy. Well, Curtis, around here we're going to be based pretty much on traditional police work, the reliable kind. Yes, sir. This is just one of over 2000 stations in the galaxy. Planet Patrol was created to monitor and protect the cosmos from tyrannical threats. We are the first and last line of defense. [music playing] [high-pitched twittering] [theme music] WOMAN ON COMMUNICATOR: Section 538, patrol complete, proceding to Section 539. [techno music playing] [toy squeaking] Put it down, idiot. Yes, Drass, that's a valuable artifact you have there, even if our colleague Rolf thinks it's useless junk. Yeah, well I'll tell you something else. I'm not getting stuck cataloging this trash. I got stuck with the last shipment. Curator asks me, I'll just tell him that I-- Tell me what Rolf? Why, he just wanted to tell you that Drass here has volunteered to catalog this shipment. Of course, we wanted to split the work up, but he insisted. Isn't that right, Drass? Huh? That you'll be cataloging all the new acquisitions. Oh, well, OK. Well, Drass, that shows a lot of initiative. It does? [laughs nervously] [suspenseful music playing] [electronic beep] [alarm buzzes] Close out security, Section 12, immediately. What is it, sir. Alarm! Alarm for the specimen room. [dramatic music] It's Drass'. It's been disintegrated. Murdered. Normally our jurisdiction only extends to interplanetary crimes. But apparently the original charter makes us responsible for local crimes on certain planets. Theka, the Museum Planet. What is it, some kind of homegrown monster? Mutant life form? No, it's a murder. Here are the briefing documents. Teleporters are locked in on charge. We will be leaving in 23 minutes. [music playing] [growling] [electronic beeps] Excellent. Yes. Yes, excellent. Lord Doom, our agent has activated the mini shape machines. Really? How marvelous. Yes. They're searching now. Excellent. They've begun their search for the Pickory stone-- limitless power, my Lord. Hm. What? What's that? Are you sure? Well, proceed as planned, and-- and keep me informed. Transmission ends. [electronic beeps] Well? Nothing serious, my Lord. I've simply been informed that the Planet Patrol has been summoned to investigate the-- not, of course, that it will interfere with our plans. Our plans? How nice of you to include me, Chamberlain. I must speak frankly. Of course, my Lord. If this plan fails, I feel I have no choice but to send you to the ice room for a week. If I did less, it would ruin my sleep. And of course, you wouldn't want to ruin my sleep, now would you, Chamberlain? Why-- why, no. Of course not, my Lord. [music playing] Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Are you going to be much longer? Excuse me, sir? Well, we have all these new artifacts left to catalog. I'm sorry, sir. Nothing in this room can be disturbed until our investigation is complete. And I was so looking forward to it. Oh, me too. Is there anything else that any of you can tell us? Well, Captain, I've done a full brain check on the robot guards, and they are definitely excluded. And according to you, there's no one else left in the wing of the museum. Yes, that's correct. The wings of the museum are environmentally isolated. This wing occupies several thousand square miles. So it's just us three. - Well, I know I'm innocent. - That's strange. So do I. That's enough. It could be any one of us. Too bad you can't run a full brain check on those three. That's an interesting point. Patrolman, how about it? Sir? Can you use your psychic powers to determine who's telling the truth? Well, I don't know. I suppose it would be possible, but only if they open their minds to me. Gentlemen, how about it? [music playing] [screams] Patrolman, patrolman, what's wrong? Psychic-- it's a psychic blast. Are you OK? As all right as I can be with this siren blasting in my ears. Oh, dear. I suppose that means that she can't clear us. Yes, that is a shame. Can you explain this, sir? I? How can I? There's nothing in this wing of the museum capable of producing such an effect. I should know, I've been curator of the Museum for, oh-- oh, heavens-- the Pickory stone. Patrolman, take care of Curtis. We'll be right back. [sobbing] I told you, I'm fit for duty. And I'm telling you the same thing the Captain told you. You need to rest. You're not fit to do anything right now. Maybe you should rest in one of the sleeping quarters. But they're the suspect's rooms. Now look, what's the point? The point is, you're out of commission until we get that psychic siren turned off. So just rest like the Captain told you. Look, it's easy to follow the orders you agree with. It's the ones you don't agree with that are tough. So just follow your orders and rest here for a while. OK? I just can't believe someone stole the Pickory stone. Curator, we need to know. What exactly is this Pickory stone? A priceless artifact, the only one in the known universe. It's incredibly powerful and dangerous. It was hidden here. It wasn't even listed in the museum records. What a tragic loss to the museum. Yeah, well, in the wrong hands that thing could be a disaster for the entire galaxy. I still don't get it. Who could have taken it when everyone was accounted for? (SCREAMING) I just don't-- [screaming] Weapons on stun, there! [roaring] Guess you should have used light stun. Shape machines. There's another one that got away. Yeah, and neither one of them had the stone. Well, it appears that this is no longer strictly a local crime. Shape machines means Lorien Lorien? The dark planet. The bad breed of trouble always looking for civilizations to conquer. And with that stone, they'll be able to do it. Well, whoever stole it must have made arrangements to get himself and the stone teleported off. Well, he won't be able to unless can find some way to get out of our site. But we're going to have to search anywhere that those shape machines might be able to get to. But we don't have much time, so I suggest we start immediately. [geiger counter clicking] There's no reason to search here. This is my personal research library. No one else has access. There's something here-- a hidden panel. Code lock. I've never seen that thing before. I have. That was one of the artifacts that came in yesterday. This was how the shape machines were smuggled in. Honestly, I can't explain it. Well, we couldn't have planted it there. That's right. We've been in the curator's sight or yours ever since we found Drass. And the shape machines aren't smart enough to be able to open this lock. So, it was the old dog all along. Of course. That's enough. I would never betray the trust of the museum. WOMAN ON COMMUNICATOR: Curator? Curator, is that you? There's no point in pretending now. If you want any leniency, you'd better cooperate. I am innocent. Come on, old boy, fess up. Where's the stone? I am innocent. Hey, watch it. What's that? It's your former associate. What's left of him. Uck. All 1.3 kilograms of him. What's that? Sir? All at 1.3 kilograms? Yes, sir. I mean, well, I might have missed a smudge or two. Able, give me the file on the murder victim. Hurry. - Right. Where are the files? Thank you. That's what I thought. Check his body weight. How much would disintegration leave behind? - You're right. - What's the problem? Some of him missing? No, there's too much of him. Then the dust was planted. Planted? Then what about Drass? [animal screeching] [growling] [electronic beeps] Captain. Ruric here. I spotted the shape machines and someone heading towards the rotunda. I'm going to follow them. Curtis, we're on our way. Robot security to the rotunda. You all stay here. Come on. You two, wait here. [sinister music] Freeze. You're under arrest. [growls] Come out. There's no escape. And you're not armed. Not armed? You could feel the power of this stone. Just wait, and I'll show you what it can do. [laughs] [electrical sizzle] [creaking and cracking] [sinister music] [gunfire] GUARD 1: No. [painful scream] [electrical sizzles] You see? And your next. So, what are you planning on doing now, huh? [laughs] Well, there's something you don't see every day. Stay undercover behind those pillars. The stone! Smash it. Smash the stone! Smash it? No. You can't. [dramatic music playing] How about that? So Drass wasn't as dumb as he looked. Then again, he did get caught. I always hated this place. Why'd I have to be born on the museum planet. Why couldn't I have been born on the-- the arcade planet, or the beach planet, or the fast car planet? Oh, don't bother answering. It's a rhetorical question. Captain, you know I was thinking. The Chamberlain's expecting a delivery, and we have the teleport coordinates now. So I was thinking, maybe we should send him something special. What is this? I thought your agent was coming through with the stone. Well, my Lord, the stone should be inside. Wait. There's something here. Let me see. [electrical sizzle] Ice room? Ice room. Yes, my Lord. Chamberlain, come back. My Lord? Take this with you. Yes, my Lord. Chamberlain. You called, my Lord? Tell me of your progress for getting us off this rock. Everything is ready, my Lord-- your agent, the warrior beast Kraa is ready for transport. What target have you chosen? A small planet in the Omega sector, called Earth. Earth. Yes, the warm planet. Yes, my Lord. It's conquest should be a simple matter. The most powerful weapons are merely atomic, no match for us. I mean, you. You need only give the word, and it'll be done. The word is given. Take this planet for us. COMPUTER : (ANNOUNCING) Official alert-- unauthorized transport. Unauthorized transport. [alarm sounding] Official alert-- unauthorized transport. Where? COMPUTER : Approaching planet three, sun 97. Is that inhabited? Yeah. Planet Earth, class 5 industrial civilization. I don't like to look at this. See? It just dropped into view. That means it was teleported. What's the size? Base? COMPUTER : 87,000 metric tons, Lieutenant Able. I'd call that big. And it's entering Earth's atmosphere. [explosion] [water splashing] [animal growls] [electronic beeps] There he is. [animal screeching] This is huge. Can we identify him? Kraa-- planet wrecker for hire. Not too smart, but he's as tough as they come. But who sent him, and where did he come from? You're supposed to be the psychic. You tell us. Run a teleport trace. It'll take time. It's a cold planet. What's that? It's a cold planet in orbit around a burned-out sun. There are people there. But they're very deep, close to the core. The-- the planet's losing it's warmth. It-- it's-- The dark-- The dark planet. They're cold, they're nasty, and they've got no sense of humor. Looks like Lord Doom is trying to heat things up again. But I guess we shouldn't be surprised. Curtis, looks like you're going out on your first patrol. You and Garth get your gear. You're ready to go to Earth. You've got a monster to fight. All right. It's about time we get some action around here. Let's go, Curtis. COMPUTER : Alert! Alert! We are under attack. Danger! Danger! [blasts] My Lord, the pulse cannons have been fired. The Planet Patrol has been neutralized. Good. That should keep those little brats occupied while Kraa secures Earth for us. [alarm sounding] You OK? Able, status report. Hold on. Base, status? Base, reset and respond. Come on. Base, wake up. Base is down. Do it the old-fashioned way. Manual systems check. Main power is down. We're running on auxiliary. That means teleportation is shot and no way to contact main headquarters. Then we're on our own. That's not the worst news. Whatever hit us destabilized the core. With auxiliary power at maximum, I might just be able to keep us from going critical. But if we can't make repairs-- We'll blow up like a supernova. Right. First thing's first. There's still a situation on Earth that needs dealing with. But we can't get off base until the main power is restored. Earth can't wait that long. We'll have to send somebody else. Who do we have in the reserves? Checking. Not good. The only agent we have in range is Mogyar, but he's on a scouting mission. He's got no supplies, no backup, and no weapons capable of stopping Kraa. He's an officer of the Planet Patrol. He'll have to do. Contact him. Right. We'll just have to hope that he can find assistance from the locals. [music playing] Sorry, grill's closed. I'm getting ready to lock up. OK? [high-pitched whine] You hear something? Uh-uh. There's something there. What is that? I think it's an aircraft. Don't see any running lights. I ain't never heard no airplane make a sound like that. No, neither have I. I think we better get out of here. [explosions] [intense music] Don't move. Get your hands off of me. I'm checking you for injuries. Are you a doctor? I took a couple of years in med school. Yeah? Well, go back and graduate before you start looking for some spinal stuff coming out of my nose. Pretty smashed up, huh? What the hell happened? Somebody drop it out of a plane or something? This thing should be in one piece after the way they crashed into the ground. Hey, I come in peace. OK? I mean you no harm. [inaudible radio communication] There is definitely signs of damage. [inaudible radio communication] Roger that. Move out. [military music playing] Aimes, Henderson, secure the roof. Bell, check the freezer. [suspenseful music playing] Command, we have an object-- non-biological. So, do you have a name? MOGYAR: Of course, I have a name. How else would the people know what to call me? Mogyar. Well, I'm Bobby Macek. And this is-- Alma James-- pleasure. MOGYAR: Pleased to meet you. So, listen up. I'm what you might call an interstellar policeman. I'm here to apprehend an alien life form, a very dangerous being known as Kraa. And he's big too, around 200 feet tall. You see, there's an interstellar pirate that named Lord Doom. And he sent Kraa to destroy the Earth-- not the whole planet, just the Earth civilizations. That's what Kraa does, like for a living. He goes around destroying planets. If we don't stop him, then Doom will take over your plan for himself. That's why I'm here. That's why I need your help. [door crashes] Freeze! - What the hell are we-- wait. - Wait. I mean you no harm. Hey, man. Haven't you guys ever heard of the Constitution? Come on. Man, you don't-- MOGYAR: [non-english] [military music playing] Oh. Oh. Hey, I come in peace. OK? Biocontainment on the double. MOGYAR: Hey, I'm here to help you. OK? [growls] [intense music playing] [brakes screech] [explosions] It's unstable. No change. All right, I'm going to have to bridge across the whole section. How much time do we have left? 35 hours by your estimate. OK. I can do it. I hope. Sir, something's happened to Mogyar. Please, make it something good if you can. Well, sir, Mogyar's been taken prisoner by some local Earth government. OK, people, for whatever reason, two beings from another planet have arrived here. Your cooperation is necessary. Now you talk to me. Where are we? - Interrogation one, right. Mr. Bridger, you're needed in command, extremely urgent. Right, Mr. Monroe. Continue the interrogation. Yes, sir. [suspenseful music playing] [air rushes] [explosions] What news? Kraa destruction is proceeding as planned. The Planet Patrol base is still disabled. Unfortunately, my Lord-- Unfortunately? They've been able to send another agent to Earth. And with his assistance, the Earth beings may be able to destroy Kraa. Well then, deny them his assistance by all means possible. It is being done, my Lord. We have sent a message to Kraa. [air rushes] [explosions] Hello, containment one. We have a no-go on surveillance. Hello, containment one. OK. That's it. Ladies and gentlemen, listen up. Mr. Collins, call an evac team, priority one, red alert. Let's hustle. [alarm sounds] Hello. This is alpha yuma indigo three three bravo. We need priority evac, full vehicle complement and security side 12. This is a priority one. MAN: All right, what's going on? Get me a picture up there. COLLINS: Sir, camera's down in containment one. [explosions] [alarm sounding] [squeaking] Look at me. I'm totally filthy. I been crawling through vents for I don't know how long. It's disgusting in there. Hey, what's going on? Do you know what that siren is all about? Sure, I know. But the big interstellar fugitive I was telling you about, Kraa. Well, he's right outside, coming here pronto. We got to get the heck out of here. Those crazy guys in the suits, they blame me. I keep telling him it's not my fault. They had me locked in a cage. I think they wanted to dissect me. Can you get us out of here? Of course, I can. I'm a superior form of life. Come on up here and follow me. I know a way out through the vents. [explosions] It's clear. Come on up. [explosions] Oh, my-- [gasps] Get down. Get down, Bobby. Get-- Kraa's too close. They won't be able to get away. There's got to be something we can do. Able, Mogyar is in trouble. We need to work some kind of delaying action. That'll be a neat trick from 14 light years away. Can we use the auxiliary power to knock him back? We don't have enough power for that by a couple orders of magnitude. Mogyar's mother ship is still in orbit. How about the power supply in that? I have a better idea. We'll use the ship itself. Able, send a transmission to Mogyar's mother ship. Crash it in Kraa. I know it won't kill him, but it may give Mogyar some more time. Captain, we'd go critical before I could finish the repairs. Able, I'm sending the transmission. You're just going to have to work faster. Captain, wait a minute. The mother ship is moving out of orbit, accelerating. [explosions] [sirens wail] OK, Bobby, come on. Come on. Come on. Hurry. Come on. [distant sirens wail] Let's get out of here. OK. You just used up 40% of our remaining reserves. In 10 hours, all that's going to be left of us is a rapidly expanding ball of plasma. Understood. Continue with the repairs, lieutenant. Yes, sir. Continuing with the repairs. We have our way of doing things around here in the Planet Patrol, Curtis. First the mission, then ourselves. Yes, sir. Scared? Yes, sir. Me too. But there's a whole planet full of people who are depending on us. [sirens wailing] Suppose we were the guy in charge of that secret base, Bridger. Now, if he wanted to get all this stuff, he could. Couldn't he? And if he needed, say, the entire electrical output from the Harvest Point Nuclear Facility, he could get that too. Couldn't he? He's got to be able to just pick up the phone and-- and call who he needs to get what he needs just like that. Would it be something like Alpha Yuma Indigo Three Three Bravo, priority one? Well, I just bring it up because that's what the [inaudible] guy said on the phone when he called in that big emergency evac. I don't suppose you got the phone number. The phone number is 1-800-555-0005-- bada boom, bada bing. Well, it's worth a try. Hello, this is alpha yuma indigo three three bravo. We have a priority one request. We need to take over the Harvest Point Nuclear Facility. We need to have their entire engineering and operations staff on hand. [dramatic music playing] Well, you didn't tell me how you wanted the controls laid out. So I hope this makes sense. OK? Right here, you've got your initial power-- laser controls, secondary generators, phase controls. And right here, you've got your master power shunt. That'll put the full 250 megawatts right through your system. That's fine. You've all done a great job. Now I suggest you get your people and get out of here. We're going to have a visitor anytime now. [dramatic music playing] I'm powering up the ray. Kraa's 200 meters and approaching. It'll be close. Pairs are finished. The stabilizers are on recharge. Figure 11 hours until we're able to bring them online. How much time do we have? The core will be hypercritical within five minutes. Make that 4 minutes 40 seconds. We'll never know what hit us. Sir, they've brought the weapon online. Well, that's something. [dramatic music playing] Oh. What? Damn it. MOGYAR: What's wrong? I don't know. A loose connection, I hope. You two stay here. I'll go try to track down the fault. They should have fired by now, Curtis. We're checking, sir. The power's been interrupted. He's getting mighty close. If Kraa reaches to the projector before they get that thing back online, it'll all be over. Able, isn't there anything we can do from here? Nothing but blow up. And I don't think that's going to help them. Yeah, us either. Curtis, any change down there? No, sir. The power is still off line. Curtis, can you do anything? Look. You know what you're capable of. We don't. Is there anything you can do? Can you help them? If you can, just do it now. I've never tried sending my powers that far. I don't know if I can. Try, patrolman. Do what you can. [growls] [explosions] [siren wails] Kraa stopped moving. Way to go. Let's hope that'll be enough. Keep going, kid, you're holding it. I can't hold on. I need your help. Curtis, what can we do? I need your psychic energy. Psychic energy? Everyone has it., but for most it's dormant. But I can use yours to increase mine. Everyone join hands. Whoa. Total mind meld action. Garth, concentrate. I can't hold on. Yes, you can, Curtis. You've got to. I can save us, but I need another 40 seconds. Save us? How? No time, don't ask. Kid, can you do it? Can you hold on? I'm trying. How much longer, Able? Sir, stop asking me. Hold on, kid. I can't hold on. [electronic beeps] Done. Done what? It's up to them now. They have to fire that weapon. To defeat Kraa? To save us. They're firing. And I'm rerouting. [electrical crackles] I'll use the last of our auxiliary power to redirect the beam. And the beam will recharge the stabilizers. In around four more seconds. Come on. Move it. ABEL: 70%, 80%, 90%-- [explosions] Full power, now. Launch full counter measures at Kraa. [high-pitched whirring] [explosions] [siren wails] Stabilizers are back online. How is she? I don't know. Reporting for duty. Hey, Curtis, you did it. You saved the day. Totally sweet, Curtis. And thanks to you guys. You go to the infirmary. Get some rest. CURTIS: Yes, sir. Base, are you back online? Affirmative, Captain Ruric. All functions operational. RURIC: Good. Prepare the transport. Set course for the Neutral Zone. The planet, my Lord, it's called Raspin. It is one of the last outposts established by the Veringian Empire prior to its collapse approximately 100 years ago. Very lightly colonized, hardly at all. Ideal for conquest. What defenses do they have? When the colony was established, they had a fleet of hyper robots. Hyper robots. No cause for concern, my Lord. After the fall of the empire, all but one was destroyed. That one robot, a scorpion model, I believe is their sole planetary defense. A single scorpion robot is more than enough to defend an entire planet. Yes, indeed my Lord, precisely my point. And more than enough to conquer one, if we can gain control of it. [inaudible] machine. We've had bad luck with these things. I freely admit their limitations, oh majestic one. But for this, my Lord, they are perfect. CONTROL: Everything OK? No problem, Control, just a little glitch with the elevator. Ready to board. Thanks, Control. Alpha to Home, mission accomplished. Understood, Alpha. How simply excellent. Proceed without delay, phase two. Proceeding to phase two. Powering the laser. GROVES: Planet Patrol, Planet Patrol, come in, please. This is President Groves from the planet Raspin. We have an emergency here. We're reading you, President Groves. What's the nature of your emergency? GROVES: The nature of the emergency? Take a look. What in space is that? Hydro robot. Did you see that, Planet Patrol? A group of mad men have taken possession of our scorpion robot. I've evacuated the entire population to the impact shelter. But that won't hold them off for long. We need your help now. [music playing] It's one of a series of planetary attack robots built by the Virginian Empire. Since deceased. Yeah, atomic shielding, has a billion teravolt laser. What's the gas mileage? Fusion power. Should be good for around 500 years. Hey, I was kidding. OK? I know. Curtis. Sir? Your recommendation. Well, atomic weapons are no good. Then, a laser weapon. You're familiar with our arsenal. What do you suggest? Well, for something like this, top of the line, a Mark 10 dual laser cannon. Don't you consider that to be overkill? No, sir. That extra mass means extra charge time on the teleporters. That thing can do a lot of damage in that amount of time. Yes, sir. But it could do even more damage if we teleport in with insufficient firepower. Lieutenant Able, move the Mark 10 to the teleport chamber. Already on the way, Chief. Patrolman Garth, you and I are on call. Let's suit up. Yes, sir. Oh, Lieutenant Able, you're in command. Can do, Chief. I agree with your reasoning, patrolman. Ma'am. Counting down to teleportation-- 5-- 4-- 3-- 2-- 1-- teleporting. Right. We're dropping them right down in our little scorpion's path. Checking. Teleportation is successful. There they are. What's wrong? Well, something sure is. That blast should have cut that thing in half. They're firing again. It's firing. [intense music playing] [explosions] We're losing the image. I've lost it. - What happened to them? Are they alive? I don't know. I'm sorry. Base, we need to know any modifications to the Virginian hyper robots in the last days of the empire. Checking. If they've modified that thing to deflect the Mark 10, then it's stronger than anything in our arsenal. But how could it be? I mean, we saw the readouts. I've completed a scan, and nothing about the retrofitting on the robots. Great. Of course, you understand, recordkeeping was a bit spotty at the time. Yeah. Get your gear, Curtis. We're going to Raspin. We'll just have to hope that they've got the information in some isolated database somewhere. What about Garth and Captain Ruric? I guess we'll find out. Let's move. Patrolman. Patrolman, wake up. Man, I'm dizzy. It's not you. We're moving. Where are we? Ah. Awake and chipper, are we? Well, if it isn't Chamberlain Cough. That's Goff. And if I were you-- Then you'd be human. That's enough, Patrolman. What do you think you're doing, Goff? Well, I think that I've acquired two members of the Planet Patrol, who are now riding on the back of my robot-- and who may prove useful as hostages. Don't kit yourself. If necessary, Lieutenant Able will blast us right along with your robots. Really? Well, that's a nice consolation prize. But as you, yourself, have discovered, destroying this machine may prove a bit of a problem, even for the Planet Patrol. Have a pleasant day, my captive friends. Cup blasters on full power. Aim for the door. Fire. Wow. Totally power shielded. Looks that way. [intense music playing] [electronic beeps] Ah, at last. Nice office, sir. Yes, well my office in the planetary palace is much nicer, but this one will do in a pinch. Did you come to discuss architecture, officer? I understand you didn't even bring any weapons with you. What do you plan to do, get blown to atoms like the last two? You don't know that. Patrolman. President Groves, have you confirmed that the other officers are dead? Well, of course they are. What else in a blast like that? Patrolman, scan for them. Have you checked your databases for the-- Yes, I did just as you asked. There is no record of any modifications being made to the scorpion robot. All those records were erased long ago. You must understand, officer, this all happened 100 years ago. I think I found them. You think? It's just a trace. It's very slight. Are they wounded? Unconscious? No. Shielded somehow. I can't get any more. But I know they're alive. Well, that's something. [alarm sounding] What's that? Sir, the robot is approaching. I'm opening fire. Is the armor holding? Yes, sir, for now. The armor on this shelter is tough, but that beam is tougher. An hour at the outside, he will cut through, and then we're all finished. What do you plan on doing about it? [explosions] I've got it. President Groves, there have to be citizens alive today who had parents who served in the Hyper Robot Corps at the end of the war. Maybe they can remember something-- even a hint. Not likely. Unless of course, you have something better to do with your time. Now look here, young lady. Excuse me. Well, yes, yes, what is it? Well, I was just listening. And I may have an idea. Yeah, don't you have a circuit to repair. Hold on. What's your idea? Well, I don't know any people who fought in the wars, but I know a machine that did. A machine? What the devil is that? It's an old battle computer out of one of the 1012s. When I was a boy, I got it for scrap after the war. I used to use it to compute field equations and-- well, you know, for company. I've had it in my attic for, gosh, 10, 20 years now. Does it still work? Well, I'm not sure. COMPUTER : Standing. Working. I recognize you. You're little Joey McPherson. Yes. Yes. Boy, Computer, it's great to hear your voice. I judge from your appearance it's been 10 to 12 years since I was last activated. Well, yeah. COMPUTER : So how have you been? Oh, well, I know I should have looked in on you, but-- COMPUTER : That's all right. It's not like I have any feelings to hurt. I hate to intrude here, but in about 12 minutes we're all going to be blown to bits, unless you can help us. There's no time to explain. Plug him into the main data terminals. In scanning. Oh dear, bad situation. Look, Computer. We need to know if there's anything that can defeat that robot, any weapon that can penetrate whatever special shielding it's got. Well there was once. Hold on. Let me see if it's still in existence. Well, even if we find the weapon, how are we going to be able to deliver it from in here? Don't worry about that. It comes with its own delivery system. Ta-da. Bingo. Found it. 300 meters southeast and 800 meters straight down. Straight down? What is this? Curtis, Mr. Fierson, take your computer. Let's move. A minor complication, my Lord. I see. I'm online, and I feel great. Where are they? Where are they? ABEL (ON COMMUNICATOR): Lieutenant Able to President Groves. Able, that beam will cut through in a matter of minutes. Well what are you waiting for? Engage them. Destroy them. COMPUTER : Scanning. Objectives approach from due east. Weapons are powering up. I'm turning to bring our objective into view. Get ready to fire. Ready to fire. OK fire. Position locked on. They're on board. What? Hello, Planet Patrol. Before you open fire, I'd like to show you something. I'm told this won't prevent you from blasting my little robot. So, please, blast away. Ta-ta. Locking weapons on. No, wait. I don't like his attitude. Give me some room. Got it. [electrical sparking] Here it comes. [intense music playing] Fire! Fire! The [inaudible] dead. Computer kicked him out? Come on, boy, you can do it. Fire! [explosions] Hooray. Hooray. Nice work, old buddy. Come on, Patrolman. Let's go find Captain and Garth. Captain, we're both here. Are you two OK? No problem at this end. Yes, sir. One more thing. Lieutenant, Patrolman. Yes, sir? Good work. Thank you, sir. Thank you. So, another failure. Yes, my Lord Doom. There must be punishment for your incompetence, of course. Yes, my Lord. Your warmth allotment is reduced by half. [thunder crashes] Uh! The Planet Patrol. Lord Doom, you have violated the Omega Planetary Peace Treaty. And sending Kraa to Earth constitutes as an act of intergalactic war. You're under arrest. Well, if it isn't Varic and his whiny space police pre-school. I remember when you were still at the academy, barely able to wipe your nose. Now, you're a captain. [laughs] I don't like prisons Varic. I don't like them at all. You two, get Chamberlain. Doom is mine. Ah, good, a fight. [growls] Man, this guy's slipperier than a weasel. You're finished Doom. Master! No. No. [growling] Make yourselves at home, fellas. Enjoy your victory while you can. No prison can hold me for long. Yeah, what he said. [growls] Shut up, you little space flea. This is all your fault. Let's go. We'll figure out what to do with these deadbeats later. This isn't over Varic. I will get out of here, and then I will have my revenge. My Lord? What. Revenge might be easier if we use this. [laughs demonically] [music playing]
