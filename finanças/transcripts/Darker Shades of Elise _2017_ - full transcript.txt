Subtitles by explosiveskull - What? - What do you... What salad do you like? Elise, what are you doing here? You didn't even... call to say you were coming. Yeah, um, so... I'd better be off. I'm preparing things for the Collins account tomorrow. Um... So if we meet first thing and grab a coffee, then we can review. Yeah. You better make mine extra strong. As if I'd forget such a thing in the morning. So... What do you need? Well, I just thought you said you were gonna be on time this evening for dinner. They needed me to stay late, so... so I'm here. Do you know what day it is today? You lost me. Third of March. Our anniversary. Fuck, Elise. I totally forgot. Yeah, I know. It's the work load they put me on. I was completely snowed under here and... Yeah, you looked really busy when I walked in just then. Really busy. Look, I was just... Hello. No, I can't right now. Okay, okay. Yes. All right. Okay. I'll come and meet you now. Okay, bye. I have to go. Okay? It's an emergency. Sorry. - No, you don't... - I have to. I have to go. - Okay? - Please, no. That was Simon. Oh, Rick. No, not tonight. It's our anniversary. Come on, please. Look. Stay with me tonight. Elise, I can't. I've got to go, okay? No, you don't. Just put my... Just put my dinner in the oven, okay? I'll have it later. So let me get this right. Actually, he forgot your anniversary? Yeah. And I was stood there, and of course... got completely rejected. God, I feel like such a fucking idiot. You're gonna need something stronger than that. - Right. - Hold on. I mean, it's obvious what's been going on, though. I've known it for months. Go on. That he's cheating on me. What, with one of those receptionists? Yeah. Yeah, he must be. In fact, I know he is. I mean, all these strange work hours of his, and having to suddenly leave in the middle of the night. No, he's cheating on me. You know what I would do? What? Go fuck every man in sight. What? Get him back. You know, and if he has a reason to dump you in the future for some other girl, then... you'll have something to throw in his face. No, no, no. I couldn't do anything like that. I mean, I'm married. I couldn't do that to him. Go have fun. Enjoy yourself. You deserve it. I couldn't do that to him. It's just wrong. You know... He's here. - Who's here? - He's here. - Come on, you need to go. - Wait, who's here? Raymond. Some guy I met online. No, no. Didn't you learn your lesson after the last one? That guy... I can't remember what he was called. Charlie? Yeah, Charlie. Oh, he was hot. But he got weird as fuck, you know. He wouldn't stop texting and calling me and stuff. I had to get rid of him. Now, come on, you need to go. Okay. Just be careful with this one. Is he cute? Hmm. He's stacked. And he's well hung. If that makes me a bad friend, then so be it. Now, come on, you need to go. All right. Okay. God, ever since you left your marriage you've been having so much fun. I have. And so should you. Now, don't be a sorry ass and get some fresher meat. Come on, you need to go. Okay, okay. Have fun. You bet I will. I'm sorry, I just don't have any notes in the book. It was for 3:00 p.m. to meet with Janet Waters. Take a few images for a plan, I suppose. Felix. Oh, Janet. Nice to meet you. Yeah, we don't actually need you today. Why is that? Because we don't need a photographer. It must have slipped my mind. But, anyway, we don't need you, so please leave. Really nice way to run a business, lady. Really nice. Thank you for nothing. Cheers. Thank you very much. Great. Oh, Elise, if you're looking for Rick, he's actually got a meeting with a client about... He and she have had the a date booked in for a while. Elise? Elise? Right. I'm almost out. Do you wanna go out for a bit of dinner? You're off out somewhere? - No. - It's just the outfit, then? Okay, I'll see you later. Hey, do you mind? No, go ahead. You know, you could just go over there and talk to him. What do you mean? Whoever that guy is over there, you're pretty enough to just go over there. I'm sure he would not turn you away. No, no. It's nothing like that. What's it like? What's wrong? Man in black gone. What? Yeah, actually. Well... I'm not going anywhere. I don't know who that guy was over there, but he clearly doesn't deserve you. Wow. You sure do know how to flatter a girl. I flatter the ones I want, yeah. And the ones you don't? Why would that matter? You are not one of those. Ah. Oh, my God. It's you. The photographer from the office. Oh, my God. I'm sorry. Nice to see I've made and impression. No, no. It's not that. I've had a lot on. But, listen. About Janet... Don't pay any attention to what she said. She can be a complete bitch. Your boss? No, no. She's not my boss. And I don't work there either, for the record. May I ask you what you do? Don't tell me you're a photographer as well and stole my job from me. No, no. - Are you? - No, no. Good. I wanna photograph you. Not a portfolio, just a one time thing. No, my days of posing for the camera are long gone. Wait, you've posed before? Why don't you tell me? Yeah, I used to do some acting when I was younger. Why did you stop? Please let me. You'll enjoy it. Just let me. Are you sure we should be doing the shoot inside? What? You don't like it? It's fine. I can... No, you... You look incredible. Have a seat. Anywhere you want. Pick it. Anywhere you want. - Anywhere? - Mm-hmm. Okay. But not there. - Is here okay? - Mm-hmm. I have also... prepared some candles. I'm a bit nervous. Don't be. I'm just gonna take a few test shots. I haven't done this for a while, so... You'll be fine. Just relax. So do you live here with someone? Yeah, actually, um... My husband. - Oh, really? - Yeah. And where is he? Embarrassingly, um... Turn this way. He was the guy I was spying on. Really? Yeah, I know it's a bit weird, but... That is a little bit weird. Why would you say... No, I think it's actually quite hot. Trust me, it's not. How do these look? I'll show you in a minute. You're so impatient. I'm curious. What? You had a little bit of... Oh. ...lipstick on your... My chin? You're perfect. I'm really not. What has your husband done to you? What do you mean? Well, to make you lose all your confidence. Come here. - What? - Give me your hand. Come on. Walk this way. - What? - Come with me. Sit down. Oh, gosh. What are you doing? Get ready. Boo! That is what we call a mirror. Look at yourself. You keep your eyes on yourself. You're beautiful. And you need to know that. Look at yourself. Nobody looks like that. Or feels like this. Take your dress off. What? What? I don't even know your name. Oh, how rude of me. Felix. Nice to meet you. Elise. I want your confidence to come back. Kiss me. You're so beautiful. Wait. No. I can't. I can't. What's wrong? I can't do this. Why? You just need to leave. Can I get any of you guys coffee? We're fine. Thank you, Elise. You're so sweet. Rick, I've got to get home. Give me a kiss then. Uh, Rick, actually... before you go, I just need you to have a look at this floor plan. I've had them drawn up for a while, but I just need you to approve them. What is this? Remind me. It's the floor plan of the stairs. Remember? I was thinking we should have it over in this corner, - like I originally planned. - Wait, wait, wait. That would make more sense. Tessa, we can have some time to go over this? Yeah? Give Elise some help? I'm more than capable of doing this myself. - I can finish this. - You don't know the first thing about this stuff, okay? - But look... - Tessa. Next week, okay? Yeah. Yeah, that's okay. You have to go no, okay? Sure. I am going to... No. Oh, my God. - Don't drop me. - Are you ready? Are you ready? Don't drop me. Oh, my God. Oh. What's that? Huh? All that shit. Oh, my God. Oh, fuck. It's Rick. Yeah. You have to go. - It's fine. - No. - If he thinks... - I can handle him. No. No, please, just go. Are you serious? Look, I need to go and speak to Rick. Please. Hey. I know you didn't expect me back so soon. Listen. I know I haven't been around that much. And I've been absent in our relationship. Yeah. But I want this to work. I want us to get back what we had again. But why? Why haven't you been there? Work has just completely taken over. And after what happened, I think I used it as a big cover up. And I delved deeper into it to avoid the realities of life. I should have been there for you. I shoulldn't have left you on your own to cope. I'm sorry, Elise. Anyway... See? I'm just gonna grab a shower. - Can you do me a favor? - Mm-hmm. Can you grab me some ties? I've got to pack up. Yeah, of course. Oh, my God. What are you doing? What took you so long? Felix, he's in the shower. Yeah, I know. That's exactly what you love about it. No, we can't. Yes, we can. Yeah? Can you grab me a towel? Yeah, sure. Elise? Can you pass me the towel? How long were you watching? For a minute. Get in the bed. Okay. I will see you in a few days. This trip... what is it? Some boring business. Nothing you would be interested in. Okay. Okay. Have a good time. Okay. You too. See you later. Perfection. - Fuck. - What? Don't I have to go? Your husband's gonna be home. Oh, no, no, no. Relax, relax. Relax. Rick's actually away on a business trip. - Is he? - Yeah. You didn't say. Well, he's not back until Tuesday. So I'm gonna be all alone. Hmm. Am I invited? I can come around. Oh, do you even need an invitation anymore? You know when we first met... Mmm? I said that I want to fulfill your every desire. Well, I do. I do. Like what? Well... You wanna know something? Hmm. I liked seeing you with another man. I did. - Really? - Mm-hmm. I wanna... How should I put it? Invite... other men over to your house and... give them permission to... make love to a married woman. Don't look at me like that. - That's what you want? - Yeah. Do you want that? Yeah. I guess. Okay, I'll arrange it then for when your husband's away. Wait, I don't... This weekend, when your husband's away. I don't know. Hmm. No excuses. You said yes. Elise? - Who's that? - Oh, fuck. Oh, it's Rick's PA. You need to leave. Now. Go. Give me a kiss. - Just go, go, go. - Tell me you love me. - What? - Tell me you love me, or I won't go. Elise, are you in there? - I won't leave. - Okay, I love you. I love you. Tess. Please, please, please, don't tell Rick. Tell him what, Elise? Thank you. Look, if you ever need to talk, I'm here. Okay? Bye. So he told me that he loved me. And then he made me say it back. You don't, though, do you? No. No, of course not. Are you sure? Yeah, I think so. So, what's he like? Oh, he's amazing. Yeah. I mean, he's not really your type, but he's well built. Great ass. That's important. Yeah, I was... I was thinking about taking up my acting career up again. Oh, yeah? Well... Be careful this time, okay? You got hurt really bad last time. I don't want you to get hurt again. I really care about you. Yeah, yeah. You're right. Yeah. So, um, we're experimenting this weekend. - Oh, yeah? - While Rick's away. Yeah? Tell me more. Oh, my God! Who are you? Get the fuck out. I said get the fuck out of my house now! Felix. Are you ready to explore, Elise? I wanna see you get taken by another man in your husband's bath. Why are you sleeping with me? It's a long story. I have time. Um, well, I moved to London when I was 16, um, for my acting career. I was doing really, really cool shoots all over the world and stuff. And I met Rick here in London at a networking event. He was a little bit older than me. He was a banker. He had a great job, and he was so charming. Um, the age difference didn't really matter to me. There was just something about him that made me... I just wanted him. I felt like I needed him. We had great sex. - Hmm. - Just like this. - Just like this? - Just like this. And we had a great relationship based on great sex. But, um... I don't know. After a while I fell pregnant. And then what happened? Well, I was indifferent about the pregnancy. But, Rick, he... He wanted the baby. Seven months into the pregnancy, I, um... I lost it. I lost the baby. I'm sorry. No, don't be. It's... It's stuff that happens, isn't it? It can't be helped. And now? - Now? - Mm-hmm. Um, now. Okay, now I'm no longer a model. No longer have a career, no longer having fun, no longer... No longer in love. Oh. You know that day we met in the cafe? How could I forget? I was following him to the woman he's been sleeping with. Yeah. I plan to confront him that day. What stopped you? I didn't have the facts. Would you have left him? Yeah, I was thinking about it. You deserve everything. Including this strawberry. - Open. - Why are you so messy? Open. Bite it. I bit it. Oh, my God. Do you wanna try something else? Huh? - What now? - Do you wanna? - Now? - Yeah. - What do you mean? - Stay here. Wait. No, no, no. I don't think I'm ready for any more. Felix. Felix? Who are you? I'm Tom. You must be Elise. So, what do you think, Elise? Do you, uh... Do you wanna try? Yes. Yeah, I loved it. Did you? What did you love about it? I love all that you do. We should do it again. Fuck, it's Rick. Shit. I'm just backing out. - Leave. - Go. Who is he? - Who? - Don't lie to me. Hi. Cheers. Thank you. Felix. - Good to meet you. - Rick. Good to meet you. I'm Elise's husband. We didn't realize you'd be back so soon. We were just... on the rooftop taking some shots. Elise, I'm proud of you. Can I have a look, then? The photos? Oh, what do you think, Elise? - Oh, I don't know. - Should we... show him? No. No, I don't know. You'll have to wait until I'm airbrushed. How was she? Still got it? Your wife is... fetching. You know, I've told her numerous times to take it up again. And I'm glad that she finally listened. Anyway, I'll be seeing you soon, and great to meet you. - And you. - See ya. He's nice. Oh. It's about time you turned up. Wait, is Rick back? Calm down, he's not here. His assistant let me in. Thank God. You scared the hell out of me. Seriously? You do realize you missed our lunch today, right? Oh, shit. B, I'm sorry, I completely forgot. Sorry? Where were you, then? Assuming you weren't with Rick. No, listen. I was with Felix. You spend every living second with that guy. Seriously, what's going on? I thought it was a bit of fun and you didn't like him like that. He is a bit of fun. I'm married. Well? You're blushing. And I know you. It sounds more than just a bit of fun to me. So when's Rick actually gonna be home? I don't know. He's probably out with clients or at the office, as usual. I guess I best be going then. No, wait. Don't do that. You don't have to go. Come on, stay. I... I can get us some wine and we can have a catch up. Come on. Look, Elise. I know what it's like to be crushing on someone, okay? It's just... You're my best friend, and... you've just disappeared on me. Just... Give me a call when you actually want to meet me, okay? I've got to go. I love you. Boo! Oh, my God! Felix! How did you get in here? The door was open. Why, what's the matter? I've missed you. Felix, stop, stop, stop. What? Look, should we go out for a drink or something? No. I have something better planned. - No, no, no. - Come... with me. - No, no, no. - Come on. What is this? Our next adventure. Sit down. Meet... - Mindy. - Don't touch me. Get down there, you little slut. Come on. Quickly. Come on. Join us. Ow. Do you like that, Elise? Do you like him in pain? You do, don't you? Do you want a go? He likes it. Here, you have a go. Come on. Good girl. A bit harder. Come on, you can do better than that. Oy. Oy. Come here. What's the matter? I don't know if this is something that I want anymore. Why? I don't know what I thought this was, but... it's all gone completely out of control and I... I was thinking I should go back to my husband. It's because of the girl? No. I've seen four men take you in front of me. I do it for the first time and that's a problem? No, Felix, she's not the problem. We are. I needed to speak to you today, because... I had a pregnancy scare. And if it had been positive I wouldn't have known who the father was. So I think it's just time that this little fantasy ended before it gets out of control. You told me you love me. No, I didn't. You told me in your house. Oh, Felix, no. No, no, no. You made me say that. You made me, You wouldn't leave. We would have been caught. What was I supposed to do? Felix, look, I'm married, okay? You knew this about me. I can't give you what you want and it's not fair to continue this any longer on anyone. - No, I know what you want. - No. I know what you want. I know. You felt threatened because of the girl. That's all it was. I can give you what you want. You know I can. I love you so much. No, please stop. No, listen to me. I can give you what you desire. Oh, Felix, don't. Now get in here! Felix, no! Felix, no! Shut up. What the hell is going on? Get the fuck off. Are you all right? What the fuck is wrong with you? Seriously, what is wrong with you? Get the fuck out. You heard her. Get out. If you don't leave in the next minute, I'm calling the police. I'm going. You need to keep away from that kind, all right? He's not fucking worth it, is he? - Thank you. - It's all right. Go home. Elise, did that guy hurt you? Leave it, Tess. Elise, you need to end it with him. Good guys don't do stuff like that. I have ended it with him. Good. Let's just say he didn't take it very well. You gotta be careful. Yeah, I know. But don't worry. I'm fine. Good. Yeah. Let's just... hope I don't see him ever again. Yeah, hopefully. Mmm. Ready? Yeah, I think so. You look like a million dollars. Thank you. - I'll be right back. - Okay. Wait. Why is Felix here? Well, you wanted someone here, so, um, I wanted you to have someone. Bianca wasn't free, so... Take a seat. Elise. You look stunning, Elise. Hey, you okay? Thanks for inviting me. - Wow. - Yeah, I know, right? So have you... Sorry. John, have you met my wife, Elise? Elise, this is John. They've met before, no? Hey, Elise. Oh, hey. - How are you? - Oh, good. How are you? - Ages ago. - Yes. You look great. It's good to see you. I love the dress. Thanks. And who are you? Kept him a secret, didn't you? - Felix. - Tara. - Great to meet you, Tara. - Nice to meet you too. You have gorgeous eyes. Oh. You sure know how to flatter a girl. I flatter the ones I want. Ooh, really? And those you don't? You do not wanna be one of those. Cheers. How about that? I mean... I think you'll find that actually me and Greg will never die out because we discovered that he has this insane love and hate... and we got... You know... It was loads of fun. Elise, what's next for you and Rick now that his contract is terminating? Elise? Yes, sorry. I said, what's next for you and Rick now that his contract is terminating? What do you mean? Yeah. Actually that is what tonight's about, and I've actually called it quits on the old job. And... So I can focus, take something a bit more manageable, for less hours... Less stress. So I can focus more time at home. Oh! Sweet of you. Excuse me. The toilet. I'll go and see if she's okay. What's got you so tense? You have people sat at that table out there. Felix, you did that right in front of my husband. It was hot, though, right? You enjoyed it. Are you not listening to anything I've been saying to you? That was far too close. Never again. Never say never. This isn't some game, Felix, okay? This is my life. - Your life? - Yes, my life. Your life? Let me tell you something. Your life is gonna get a whole lot more interesting now. - Do you understand? - Get off me. Don't speak to me like that. Who do you think you are? Felix, you fucking assaulted me. - Kiss me. - No. Get your fucking hands off me. Get off me! Fucking creep! She was just... Elise. Your husband is a very hard worker. We'll be sad to see him go. You're a lucky girl. And the men's bathroom is at the other side of the restaurant. I just came to see if she was all right. Right. I don't think you realize just how lucky you are. Now, you may think that you have everything, but you can lose that just as quickly as you got it. Rick is a dear friend of mine, and I don't think he knows about these silly little games that you're playing. But when he finds out, there will be hell to pay. And as a loyal colleague, I have my suspicions. You better watch your back. Janet. Elise, you're okay? Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. Rick will be back in a second. He's just seeing some of the others off. Yeah. No, it's fine. I'll just... I'll wait. If you ever need anything, I'm here. Okay? I mean it. Thanks. Bye. Bye. Looks like they got lucky after all. After you, my lady. Okay. Oh! Thank you. Is that our best champagne? Maybe. Oh, Rick, why the suspense? Oh! Looks like I'm all yours now. Rick, you didn't have to quit your job. Why, Elise? The job... didn't make me happy anymore. I needed some time out to rethink things. And I realized that if I stayed there, you would... I would lose you. And you... are the most important thing in my life. Cheers. Oh, what's this? I love you. I love you. I love you. I love you. Who was that? I don't know. Postman maybe? Listen, why don't you pop on the kettle and I'll make us some breakfast? Wow, that's a first. Mmm. Where's the fucking remote? What do you, uh... What do you want for breakfast? Oh. Weird. Ah. That solves the mystery of the remote. Do you know what? I think it's Bianca. She must have taken it by accident the other day when she was around here. Bianca was here? Yeah, yeah. She popped around the other day. Sure. That solves that then. Where would my beautiful wife like me to take her today? Actually, I kind of have somewhere I need to be. Hmm? Where? I have a castings afternoon with Leila. - Elise Styles? - Yes. They're ready for you now. - Thank you. - Okay. - Hello there. James. - Hi. - And you are? - I'm Elise. Elise. Ah. - This is Leila. - Hi. - How are you? - I'm good. How are you? Good, then. Thank you. Good to see you. - Please. - Have a seat. Thank you. So, thank you for coming in today. As you're aware, Leila is casting for her new client. It's a very hip, young, and current brand of fragrance. So the aim of this casting is to find a girl who best matches that brand. This is your portfolio. The agent sent it across to us earlier today. Yeah, that's correct. So we'll see what we've got, shall we? I actually did something similar to this brand that you were describing. It's just in the middle of the book for reference. Of course, some of the images are a couple of years old. Sorry, is there something wrong? Sorry, it's, it's... It's not what we're after. I'm sorry, we're not looking for that kind of model. Thank you for your time. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. You didn't reply to my texts. What the fuck is wrong with you? Oh, so you got the message, then? Message? What do you mean the fucking message? You look so hot when you're angry. Oh, Felix! - So hot. - Oh, get off me! I'm sick and tired of these silly games, okay? I'm not gonna leave him. And you listen to me. If you try and... No, you listen to me. You'll do everything that I fucking tell you to do, otherwise I'll show your husband everything you've done behind his back. - All of these. - What? Do you understand? You'll do as I say, or I'll show him everything. Look, you don't have the power here. I do. Do you understand? I do. You are mine. You don't have anyone anymore. And if your husband see what you've become, he won't want you either. You allowed men you don't know fuck you. You allowed yourself to do things that no other woman would allow. You have no respect for yourself. I'm gonna show Rick these discs. He'll see you for what you really are. A fucking disgusting little slut! Tomorrow, I'll tell you where you need to be, and when. You'll do one more thing for me and this is all over. No. Now you can leave. Go on. Get the fuck out of here! And until then I'll get Mindy around again. She's a better fuck than you anyway. Stay here. Are you ready? I only wanna hear you say one thing. One word. And that's "yes." Okay? Anything else... I'll tell Rick. Ready? Surprise. Get on the bed. Get... on... the bed. She's all yours, boys. Hello, darling. Do you like that, Elise? Are you sure you want this? Do... you... like that? Yes. I can't hear you. She takes it good. Go harder on her. Go on. I'll fucking show you how it's done. I'll fucking break you. I'll fucking break you. Move over, Kyle, my turn. Now you'll do one more thing for me and that's it. No. No, you said this would be the last thing. No, I didn't. Yes, you did. No, I didn't. One more thing. Do... you... like that? Yes. I can't hear you. I said, yes! Same time, same place tomorrow. You disgust me. I'll tell Rick. Where are you going? I'm gonna tell him first. Fucking bitch! Put your clothes on. Get out. I said put your clothes on! Elise. I wasn't expecting you back. I thought you'd be out living the life of luxury. Rick, I found it. So have you heard? Rick has signed all of the papers and everything over. And it looks like I'll be filling in for him. I mean, it's a shame, really, that he's given up everything to be with such a... deceitful, unworthy slut. But hey, ho. Life shits on you sometimes. What can you do? Have a great life, Elise. Well, whatever's left of it. Janet. Get the fuck out of my house. Now. Elise, what are you doing in here? What's the matter? What's happened? - Rick... - Shh. - I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. - Come on. I have to tell you something. Right. I've been a bad person. I'm sorry. I'm so, so sorry. What is it? Hmm? I need to... I need to ask you something, okay? And I need you to be completely honest with me and tell me the truth. Okay. Have you been having an affair? Elise... Oh, please. Just... Just tell me the truth. Of course not. Who have you been talking to? What is this? Hmm? I cheated on you. What? Rick, I'm sorry. - Elise, no. - I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Rick, sit down. Who? Who was it? It was Felix. Felix? Rick, I'm sorry. Rick, I'm sorry. It didn't mean anything. It was... How long? How long? I don't know. Like the past couple of months or something. Don't look at me like that. Did you like it more with him than you did with me? No, no, no. Please, Rick. Please. Was it just with him? How... How many men? You don't wanna know. You are horrific. No, don't say that. I am gonna stay in a hotel this evening... No, no, no! - And you are gonna pack your things, - No, please. - and you ought to go. - No. I want you out of this house. No. - I want you gone. - No, please. Don't say that. Rick! Don't. It all just got completely out of control. He had this group of men there waiting for me. He said... He said that if I went through with it, that... he would leave me alone, that... that would be the end of it and the secret would be... would be safe with him, but... But it was not the end of him. He won't stop. He won't. Oh! Like, what kind of a person would do that? What kind of a person would actually agree to that and go through with it just to keep a dirty, horrible lie from her husband? Go stay at a friend's house. Stay somewhere safe, you know. With someone who can give you support. Okay? Look, I know Rick loves you. And after all of... everything that you two have been through together, I know that you're both gonna get through it. Okay? - Thank you. - Come here. You're fine. You're gonna get through it, okay? Look, I have to go, but thank you so much. Be cautious, okay? B? B? Rick? Oh, my God! Rick! Rick, are you all right? Speak to me. Speak to me. You got the message. Felix, what have you done? Sit down. Sit down. These are bad people. Do you know what they were doing all along? Sneaking around behind your back. All those worries of this one sleeping with another woman. Well, ding dong, you were right. It was this bitch. Is this true? Do you see it now? Hmm? I'm the only one who's ever been here for you this whole time. Since that day I saw you... at Bianca's. I was one of Bianca's many men. You remember me, don't you? I thought the first time we met was at the office that day. So, what do you mean Bianca's? What do you mean you saw me there? She thought she'd just let me go like I was nothing. You know, I was there that day. All of those you were seeing behind my back. But then I saw you. Everything changed. I saw in your desperation. Your need to be touched. To be desired. You're Felix? He told me he was Charlie. Didn't you learn your lesson after the last one? That guy... I can't remember what he was called. Charlie? Yeah, Charlie. Well, he was hot. But he got weird as fuck, you know. He wouldn't stop texting and calling me and stuff. It was a one-night stand, and you couldn't let it go! Who the fuck are you anyway? You don't wanna know who I am. Get the fuck off of me. You know they were there that day. At the cafe. It happened twice. It was over before it started. Hello? Hey, can you come around? No, I can't right now. You can't do this to me. You think I'm a one-night stand? If you don't come right now, Rick, I'm gonna tell Elise everything. Okay, okay, yes. All right. Okay, I'll come and meet you now. Okay, bye. I wanted to be with you, Elise. That's why I quit my job. I wanted to make it up to you, and be there for you. Like I should've always been. Shut the fuck up. Liar. Once a cheat, always a cheat. Well, now you know the truth, consider them for what they truly are. You see them. And you see me. It's all black and white. Felix, this isn't right. Okay? You need to let them go. Let them go? After what they've done? These two are the last attachment. Once they're gone, it's just us. Look, what they did wasn't right, but neither was what we did, okay? So please just put the knife down and let them go. Are you serious? Hmm? Let them go? You just wanna forget it, just like that? Hmm? No, no, no! No, no, Felix. You know, Elise, you've never been one to make decisions. No. I'll do the hard part. No! No! No! No! No! No! No! Please! No. No! No! Please, Rick. Rick. It's gonna be okay. It's gonna be all right. I promise. I promise. I'm sorry. Elise, please untie me. Please untie me. It's okay. Go, go, go. Go get help. Please forgive for me. Please. Just go. Just go, okay? Just... Go, I said, go! Go now! Yes, I need the police. Yes, police. I need help, please. He's got a knife. No. I'm gonna come back for you, okay? I need to go and get help. You're gonna be fine. You're gonna be fine. B? B. B, come on. Come on, come on, come on. Come on, speak to me. Come on. Please. Please speak to me. Come on. B, you're gonna be fine, okay? I'm gonna go get help. I'm gonna get help. We're gonna be okay. I'm sorry. Don't. Please don't. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry I hurt Rick. I need you, Elise. I don't love anyone or anything but you. Do you understand? I need to have you. You're mine. I don't know... why you rejected me before, why you said we couldn't be together. It's because you're married, isn't it? You can't leave him because you're married. Till death do you part, right? We can be together now. We can be together. Fuck you! What did you say? I said fuck you. Yeah, I heard you. Go on. Give them a show. I said fuck you! You don't have control. I do. No! Stop! You just don't get it, do you? You never had the control. This whole time you felt empowered, that's what we taught you to do... I was hoping at last you would know that. Look at you. Without me you're nothing. Without me you're nothing. No. Do you hear that? Without me, you are shit. You never had the power here. I did. I did love you. But not anymore. Go on. Do it. I... made you. Fantasy over. Uh, and then moved on to Bianca Matthew's house. Attacking and binding her, before moving on to your place, to pick up his next target, Mr. Styles. Felix... Well, we should stop referring him as Felix now, really. It's very unlikely his name was actually Felix. At the moment he's a John Doe. There's next to no evidence he ever existed. Can't you trace his family or friends? Surely, someone must know something. Oh, we followed up every lead that we had. Each one was a dead end. So he really did have no one, then. Elise, I know it's a tough subject, but I might as well run it by you. Um... As we have no contacts for Felix, there's no one to take his ashes. We can dispose of them, obviously... No, no. It's fine. I can take them. Sorry to interrupt. I just want another one. Good to see you've made a full recovery, Mr. Styles. Well, I couldn't have done it without this one. Or this one. Do you know what you're having? A boy. Congratulations. This garden is so beautiful. What will it be, that is until... the little man comes along. Who's that? It's no one. What? What? Do you want me to get some water? Yeah, please. Okay. Thank you. Yeah. Subtitles by explosiveskull
