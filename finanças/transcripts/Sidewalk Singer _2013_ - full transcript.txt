He loved to fly but he crashed his plane. We had no children. - Sorry about that. I've seen you here a couple times before, with a dog, I think. - Sam, my chocolate lab. I'm a veterinarian. - Beautiful, I've got a cat named Mocha. I got him from the humane society in Ann Arbor just a couple of months ago, so he hasn't been to a vet yet. - Well, why don't you bring him to my office on Saturday morning for a physical, no charge. - That's nice, where at? - It's on Pearl Street behind Martin's Home Center. It's called the Purple Pet Clinic. - Naturally. - Well, I didn't mean to interrupt you, it just...

That's supposed to be your job, you know? You need to earn your keep around here. At least you can do is provide a little homeland security. Hello, Mr. Johnson, I'll have the rent money in a couple more days. - Well pal, you're all ready a week late. - I apologize, Mr. Johnson. - Your apology will be accepted when you give me $350. You got two days. - Nice to see you, Mr. Johnson. Mocha, what did I just say about security? Next time attack, or are you afraid of his little bark?

Where do you go to church? - Just down there a little ways. - What's the name of it? - New Life, we got us a new pastor, my grandpa's mad. - Because of the new pastor? - No, he just doesn't like the old lady Stern on the organ. - Her name's not really old lady Stern, is it? - That's what grandpa calls her because she never smiles like you do. - Well, a singer oughta smile, right? - Guitar players, too, I play guitar. - Beautiful, are you pretty good? - I can play three chords, C, D, and G. - That's a good start.

Anyways, I made something for you. - Wow. - You can display it while you're singing, it will get people to step a little closer. - Thank you, Mrs. Johnson. I'll give it a try, it's beautiful. - I thought you'd like it being a Jesus freak and all. - You've got that right, Mrs. Johnson. Thanks again. Here we go, Mo. Time for a pick me up. It is for freedom that Christ has set us free. Stand firm then and do not let yourself be burdened again by a yolk of slavery. Huh. It's for freedom that Christ has set us free. ♫ Talking about freedom, freedom ♫ Jesus set the captives free ♫ Talking about freedom, freedom ♫ Jesus set the captives free ♫ Talking about freedom, freedom ♫ Jesus set the captives free ♫ Talking about freedom, freedom ♫ Jesus set the captives free ♫ Jesus set the captives free ♫ Talking about freedom, freedom ♫ Jesus set the captives free ♫ Talking about freedom, freedom ♫ Jesus set the captives free ♫ Talking about freedom, freedom ♫ Jesus set the captives free ♫ Talking about freedom, freedom ♫ Jesus set the captives free ♫ Jesus set the captives free - Catch you later, Kris. - Hey, Halim, thanks for hulking the crowd, I owe you one. - No prob. - Sir, wait a second, mister, hold up! You gave me a grant. - You earned it. I'm Kris Kivi. - Pastor Eric Boykan. - Pastor? - For all of five weeks, fresh out of seminary, my church is just a couple blocks away. - You wouldn't happen to have a little boy named Micah in your congregation about nine years old? - Micah Miller. - I met him yesterday. - He said you were the greatest so I figured I'd come see for myself. - And what do you think? - Well, I coughed up a 50, didn't I? - Well, was that out of your own pocket or out of the church's mission budget. - Petty cash but don't say anything. Listen, I didn't mean to take you from your music. - No problem, just getting ready to change my pitch anyway. - Your pitch? - Location, gotta find a hot spot. - I have a spot for you. Why don't you visit my church this Sunday and sing a song? - You mean during the service? - Yeah, we'll have you do special music during the worship service. - Just like that, you just met me. - I heard you singing about Jesus Christ, right? - Yeah. - Well, what's the problem? - I can tell you're new. - Really? - No pastor with experience would work things out quite like this. - The others want me to grow the church, I'm just trying to recruit a new member. What do you say? - I only sing my own songs. - That's fine, just give me one solo on Sunday at 10:30. - I'll give you my best. - Don't worry about me, just give Jesus your best. Listen, there's a little restaurant right near the church. You got time for a quick bite, it's on me? - More petty cash. - Pastor's discretionary fund. Here, let me help you carry something. Does this help you get more money/ - I guess so, I just started using it today and I got you. So, tell me Kris, have you been a street singer long? - No, I used to be a college soccer coach. - Were you successful? - Not bad. - What happened? - Recession happened, I was let go. Nobody wants to hire a 59 year old. - You have a family? - Had, I lost them all. - What do you mean? - I hit a truck killing my wife and two kids. - I'm sorry. - The truck was going the wrong way. I froze and they died. - And the people in the truck? - Just the driver, he broke his ankle. - Was he drunk? - Just tired. No record so he only got a year in prison. - He's out now? - He's out and I'm still in. - Well, you blame yourself, that's a mistake. - How many people have you counseled, Pastor? - Well, you're the first one. - You've got a lot to learn. - So do you if you're still blaming yourself. - I'd rather blame myself than God. - What did God do? - Nothing, that's the part that confuses me. - He could've done a miracle, is that what you're thinking? - Maybe. - Were your family members Christians? - Yeah. - So, they're in heaven, that's a miracle in itself. That there's a heaven and God takes believers there. For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only son, whoever believes in him shall not parish but have eternal life. - I know the verse, and I felt like God let me down. - But now you're singing about him. - Yeah, because I realize he's my only hope for coming back up. You see, I tried it for a while without God in me. Then I realized I was turning my back on my best friend and I needed my best friend. So, when I couldn't find a job, I hit the streets with my guitar and my best friend. - That's quite a testimony. - You married? - Engaged, her name's Jessica, she lives in Indiana. - When's the wedding? - We haven't set a date yet. I'm waiting to see how this job turns out. - Well, after what I've seen, I'd wait too. You just spent too much time and money on a busker. - A busker? - Yeah, a street performer, a sidewalk singer, a busker. Doesn't roll off the tongue quite as nicely as troubadour. - Yeah, well we'll see what rolls off your lips Sunday at church. I gotta run, I got an appointment in two minutes. - Counseling someone? - Actually, my first counseling session with the church. - I hope you learn something practicing on me. - Very funny. See you Sunday at 10:30. - Where's the church? - 211 West Chicago Boulevard. I'm gonna put your name in the bulletin so don't forget to show up. - Okay. - Look your best. - This is my best in a long time. - Kris? - Yes, Mrs. Johnson, it's me. - Tell me, did the sign help? - Definitely, please tell your husband I'll have his rent money tomorrow. - I'm sure he'll be celebrating tonight with an extra cup of coffee. - That'll wire him up. - Nah, he's wire proof. The only thing up night's gonna be me. He snores like a wounded buffalo. - Well, thanks again for the sign. By the way, if you're free Sunday morning, I'll be singing at New Life Church at 10:30. - Elmer, wanna go hear Kris sing Sunday at church? I heard him sing on the streets. He ain't no top liner. - He's standing right here! I'm still waiting for my money. - Ah, pay no attention to him, he's living between a rock and a hard place. - It's all right, it's pretty much where I live, too. I'm waiting. - Hush, Elmer, he'll have it for you tomorrow. - Mocha, guarding my stash? Let's see, 315 right here. $330, here you go, $330 for Mr. Johnson. We'll have a roof over our heads for another month. It's me and you, Mo. Me, you, and Jesus. For some reason, some people don't seem to like Jesus anymore. I hate to be the one to tell you but some people don't like cats either. I know that hurts but I like you both. Three of us need to figure things out before winter because I can't be singing with icicles hanging off my mustache. Florida would be nice. But I can't leave my family. We need an inside job. Maybe the vet needs a mouse catcher. - Hi. - Hello. - Hello, is this Mocha? - Yes, it is. - He's gorgeous. - Don't give him a big head. - I'll take you back to the doctor. Mocha is here, Dr. Purple. - Hello, Kris. - Nice to see you again. - Oh, Mocha's a ragdoll. How handsome, ragdolls have a very sweet temperament, very calm, lots of charm. - Definitely a charmer. - Just sit him here on the table. I hope you don't mind, but I called the humane society and had Mocha's records faxed to me. - No problem. - Let's see, he's two and a half years old and all of his shots are current, so let me just take a look at him. What about it, sweetie pie? 12 pounds, eight ounces. And a nice healthy coat. - No flea circus. - Not even a ringmaster. Oh, what a smile, nice gums. What kind of food are you giving him? - He's a cat so I feed him cat food. - Are you always such a smart aleck? - Only when I'm around nice people. - That supposed to be a compliment? - Pretty much, you're one of the few people who somehow seems to bring out the best in me. - This is your best? - My new Pastor seems to think so. - I see. Oh, such pretty eyes. Let me get nosy. All right, let me listen to his heart and lungs. - How is it? - Steady and strong. Good. Well, it looks like Mocha's healthy. - Well, that's good news. - Yes, it is. And how about you? Are you staying healthy? - I don't need my temperature taken, if that's what you mean. - Well, Mocha still has nine lives. - Thank you, it's nice to see you someplace besides a cemetery. - So, where do you work? - I'm a musician, I write songs and play the guitar. - I'd like to hear you in concert, where do you play? - Well, I'm playing at New Life Church tomorrow morning. - That's great, a musician. - Thanks again. - Oh, it's my pleasure. Oh, here's a purple mouse for him. - Beautiful, a training aide. - Well, god bless you. - I don't hear that a lot. - What, god bless you? - Yeah. - Well, you said you had a pastor and you're playing at church tomorrow, right? - Correct. - Well, I put two and two together. If it acts like a Christian and talks like a Christian, it must be a Christian, right? Oh, look at that, my college degrees came up after all. - Who's the smart aleck now? - Ah, it takes one to know one. - Adios. That wasn't so bad, was it? Told you I'd be right beside you. Of course that dog was a little scary. I think his name was Killer. I'm just kidding, had you going though, didn't I? You definitely weren't afraid of a dog. I should just call you macho instead of Mocha. Just switch a couple letters around, right? - Don't say a word. Empty your pockets. - This guitar's a piece of junk. - Yeah, but we got a big payday. Come here. Hold still. The letter S for satan. - Looks and sounds better now. Don't call the cops. - He ain't got no phone, he's just a bum. - Let's go. - Why'd you have to kick him? - Who cares, he's just a bum! - Oh no, the church. Good morning, everyone. Good morning. - Welcome to New life Church. It's great to see everyone this morning and I hope that you've all had a wonderful week. Let's begin our worship service with a word of prayer. Our dear Heavenly Father, we thank you for this gathering and invite your presence. You are so good to us, God, and I pray that what we do here today will please you. Kris! Excuse me everyone, this is Kris Kivi, a friend of mine. - Isn't he supposed to be performing today? - Oh, I certainly hope not. - I'm sorry, Eric, I can't sing. - Jesus man, what's wrong? - What happened, Kris? - I was beat up and robbed. - Who did it? - I'm not sure, some gang. - Let me look at him, I'm a doctor. She'll just give me a rabies shot. - Only if you need one, I'm a vet. - Please, just go back to the church service, I'll sit here and be all right. - I don't know, Kris. You need to go to a hospital. - Oh no, I'm okay, just skip my solo. - Here, let me take that, Pastor. - Pastor Boykan shouldn't be inviting people like that here, we're in the church. - I think we hired the wrong minister. - Let's go ahead and sing Hymn number 886. Oh, for a thousand tongues to sing. - You sure you're all right? - More embarrassed than anything. - Embarrassed? - I let the pastor down. - It wasn't your fault. - Story of my life. - What do you mean? - Nothing, forget it. - Can I help you? - I was mugged last night. - What was taken? - Almost $400. - Were you hurt? - I was kicked and knocked out. - Well, this is Sunday and everyone's pretty much out. You can fill out a report and we'll have someone call you and go over it with you. - I don't have a phone. - There's no way to contact you? - Not really. - Not at your workplace? - No. - Where do you work? - I'm a street musician. - Street musician. Take this and fill it out and bring it back tomorrow, we'll go from there. - Beautiful. - That was interesting. - No one cares much about people who are struggling to survive. - I care. - Well, thanks for showing up to hear me sing. Maybe some other time. I'll walk from here. - Well, where do you live? - I've got a place, if that's what you mean, it's not just a cardboard box. - That's not fair, Kris. I wasn't implying anything. - I'm sorry. I rent a place with my cat, since I never went home last night, Mocha might think I got mugged or something. - Smart aleck. Oh, Kris, I heard the bad news. - That was quick, news travels fast around here. - I never have to go to church on Sunday. I just sell my sandwiches and listen to the talk. Today it was toasted single and roasted preacher. - Paster Eric got criticized? - His wisdom, or lack thereof, was being questioned. - Concerning me? - Inviting people to church that make a living on the streets was a hot topic. - For me? - Streets take care of their own, man. - Thank you, Kareem. - Never fear, Kareem is here. You tell me who beat you up, I'll sprinkle their hot dog with rat poisoning. - I'll pay you back. - It's on the house. - In spite of the gossip, you oughta give real church a try. - If and when they invite you back, I'll come along for the ride, man. - Deal. Hey, Mo. Did you miss me last night? Our first night without each other. I hope it never happens again. I slept in an alley, but I didn't meet any alley cats. Found the. - Please, I just wanna talk, I mean no harm. - What do you want? - It's $125, it's my take from last night. - Come in, sit down. - I'm sorry about what happened. I didn't want any part of it. - Cops want me to fill out a report. Right there, what do you suggest? Since you know all the players, you wanna fill it out for me? - I don't really know what to say. - What's your name? - I don't really wanna say. - Then our talk is over. - Jason Sturgis. - Hand me my guitar case behind you, Jason. You got a knife on you? - What? - A knife. Toss it here. - What are you doing? - You'll see. ♫ Come rest in my arms and be ♫ Just be - Greater is he within you than he's that's in the world. - What does that mean? - First John 4:4, Jesus is greater than evil. This guitar is not what it should be because a string's missing. When Jesus is missing from your life, you're not what you should be either. - Ricky cut the strings, not me. - Ricky? - Ricky Jones. - What's the other guy's name for my report? - I'll go to jail if you turn us in. - I know there was a third guy, what's his name? - I shouldn't have followed you here. - I'm glad you did, you learned a lesson. When something's missing from your life, when you realize what it is, you apply. - I'm sorry you got hurt. I'm gonna make it up to you. - By picking new friends? - Tommy Jackson, the third guy. ♫ Just trust me and I'll be all you'll ever need ♫ I've been battered and bruised ♫ Thought I'd lose it all ♫ Fell flat on my back - Find what you're looking for?

Some of the people might not like the moonlighting. - Well, I work for Jesus and I think he likes this. - This is my friend Dwayne, he jams with me sometimes. - Hey, padre. It's the most reverend, Eric Boykan. - You're a cool dude. - I was gonna say my therapist. Hey Pastor, say a few words to our congregation. Give them some church. - Make no bones about it, I love Jesus. The Bible says that he sets us free from bondage and heals broken lives. I believe it so much that I became a minister. I would like to invite all of you to New Life Church Wednesday at 6:30. This little band will be playing the music and we could really use your support. I'll be sharing how Jesus can change your life, no problem is too big for a big god. I hope to see all of you on Wednesday at 6:30. - As you can see, this pastor is not normal. That's why you wanna come and hear him speak. We'll see about the music.

Elmer went upstairs, that's when the cat took off. And I went inside and the cat went right past me. - Which way did he go? - He went that way, Elmer ran after it. - Mocha, Mocha! Mocha! Mo, Mocha! My god, you found my cat. - Not so fast, man. Finders keepers. - That's my cat. - The way I see it, I have possession so this cat is mine. I'll sell it to you for $200 or else I'm keeping it. - You all ready stole my money, Ricky. You and Jason, and Tommy. - Hey, how do you know our names? - Come on, Ricky, give him his cat. - Shut up, Jason. - Like I said, I'm keeping it. - Over my dead body. - Put the knife away, mister. And I thought I was deaf. I said put the knife away! And give him his cat. - You're gonna pay for this, old man. - The name is Wyatt Earp but you can call me sir. - You're crazy. Let's go. - Jason, come on! - I'm done! - What is that supposed to mean? - If you touch either one of these men ever again, I'll turn you in for last night's robbery and assault. - You were part of that too, buddy! - I'll turn all three of us in, including myself. - Fool, let's go. - Thank you, guys. You know how to use that thing? Careful with it. - I ain't fired it in 20 years, I couldn't even find the bullets. I wasn't coming out here with no protection. - Okay, Wyatt. - Sorry for all the trouble. - Looks like you've left trouble behind. What will those guys do to you? - I won't be here to find out. My parents will take me in, that is if you don't turn me in. - Go with god. - You'll see me again. - Let's go home and let Mrs. Johnson know everything's all right. - I don't need any escort, I walked here all by myself. - I know that. - You still owe me rent! - I know that, too. How about if I trade you something? - I don't want nothing, I only want cash and my patience is getting thin. - I know, Mr. Johnson, I know. I think you saved my life tonight. - Oh, don't go telling my wife that, she won't sleep for a month. - It's me, Kris. I've had a crazy few days. I was mugged but I'm okay. Let's see, I met a pastor and I had a gang member over to the house. You'll be glad to know, Annie, I went to church. The pastor's a new guy, a young guy. Derek, you'd like him, he reminds me of you. And you'd like him too, Heather. He's helping me some. It's not my fault. He told me it's not my fault. I know in my heart you don't blame me. Thank you. I'll be right back. I heard you love flying. - Hey, Kris, where'd you get the sign? - My landlady made it, she's a sweetheart. - My sister's my landlady. I have a tent out by her house. Busking takes care of my food. You think anyone's gonna show up Wednesday night? - He will and that's good enough for me. You know the song, Dwayne. ♫ My shield, my shield is, my shield is ♫ My shield is, my shield is God most ♫ Oh my god, oh my god ♫ You make me cry, you make me cry ♫ my enemies ♫ Can overcome the past ♫ ♫ my agonies, my agonies ♫ Touch the hunger and soul and heal me ♫ Touch my hunger and soul and heal me ♫ My shield is god ♫ Mother, father, sister, brother, you know why ♫ My shield, my shield, my shield, my shield ♫ Is god most ♫ My shield, my shield, my shield is god most Thank you, everyone. - That was fun, man. - Jesus man, you gotta get to church. - What's the matter? - Old lady Stern's and some other people are yelling at the pastor. - About what? - About you. - Keep our pitch, I'll be right back, okay. - I got your back. - Where's the meeting? - At the church library. Why would you there? Sneaked up by the door, they don't want you singing at church. Okay, you go home, I'll take care of it. But I wanna come. Not this time, I'm sure they don't want any kids there. But-- Just go home, thanks for finding me, okay. All right. - The last thing we wanna do is turn people away from the Lord. Hello, Kris. - May I come in? - Certainly. - This is a closed meeting. - I won't stay, I just wanna say something. - Did the pastor tell you about this? - No, suffice it to say, a little angel told me you might be discussing me. - Well, um-- - That's right, we are. - Shh, Mildred. - I'm a street musician, I sing songs on the street and people give donations, if and when they want. There's a bit of danger doing what I do. Sometimes people pretend they're placing money in my guitar case, but they actually steal from me. Other people have called me names and threatened me. And as you know, I was beaten and robbed on Saturday night. That's the rough side of one world I live in. The other world I live in is a lonely one. My wife, son, and daughter were all killed. Now I live in a tiny apartment along with my cat. It's hard. You know, in the other world, I've discovered, actually rediscovered, is this world right here, the church, the Christian world. Pastor Eric brought hope from this world into my other worlds. He brought encouragement, friendship, he brought Jesus. He gave me a chance, believing that the people that he represents, you, would give me a chance, too. The other night I confronted people who don't wanna see me singing on the streets. They were evil people. Now I confront people who don't wanna see me singing in the church, supposedly the good people. I'm confused. In the end, I don't think this is really about who I am. It's about who you are. Thanks for your time. - Kris, I value our friendship. - Hey, brother. - My man. - You gotta let me cheer you up, Kris. - Yeah, how do you plan to do that? You gonna cover my rent? - Yeah, you wish. I did get some breakfast bars from the pastor the other day. I call it. - You better keep it for yourself. - Oh, don't worry about that. There's plenty where that came from. They got this thing called Granny's Cupboard down there. I'm pretty much granny because I get most of the food. What you say we get the buskers together and do some playing? I mean, we can get Annie, and we can get Sheila and the Bakers. Heck, we can even get the reverend on the congas. What do you think? - What do we play? - I say we play some of your material. We about picked up on a dozen of your songs. Heck we'd have some fun. We'd cheer people up, offer them some hope, give them some religion. Heck, we might even show the church what they're missing. - I don't know. - Well, let me know, I gotta split. I gotta go save the world. - Thanks for hanging out, Dwayne. - Hey, no worries, I'll see you on the streets. - What can I do you for? - It's a Steve Wilson original oil worth almost $1,000. - I've seen this painting before. Where's he from? - Montana, he's a paraplegic and he's great. Got a nice frame. - Hmm, it's your lucky day. Thursday's my wife's birthday, I'll give you 150 bucks for it. - It was my mothers, I need 350. - I couldn't sell it for that anywhere. - You said it was for your wife. Do you usually sell the gifts you give her? - It is your lucky day. 250, take it or leave it. - Mister, it's your lucky day. - I've been cruising the streets looking for you. I thought you'd be singing somewhere. What were you doing in a pawn shop? - I've been thinking about whether to give it up. - Give what up? - Singing my songs. That'd be killing my only connection to my past, to my family. God put music in my life and I've decided it needs to stay. - God put me in your life, too. I'm trying to figure out why, maybe I saw you needed a friend. Maybe I needed a friend, someone who could understand, someone who's been where I've been, ya know? - I know, thanks for caring. I told you I did. - To be your friend is a gift. - It was your music that drew me to you in the first place, remember? - I remember, I won't give it up. - You didn't sell your guitar then, did you? - No, not my guitar. - Please keep holding me. I haven't been held in such a long time. - Neither have I. Mr. Johnson, I've got the rent money for you. - About time. - Sorry I'm so late. - From now on there'll be a $10 late fee. - Beautiful, thank you. - One more thing, I like you, Kris, but-- - I know, don't tell your wife. - I got an image projected. - My lips are sealed, Mr. Johnson. ♫ Oh, sweet Jesus, master, shelter ♫ Holy one mediator, savior, redeemer ♫ Lamb of God, Emmanuel, and let you Jesus fix you up ♫ I cannot stop loving you - Hi, Kris. May I come in a minute? - Sure, good to see you, Pastor. Have a seat. That's Mocha. - Hi, Mocha. How you feeling? - I don't know, how should I feel? - I came to tell you what the elders decided after you left. - Yeah, do I get to sing in church? - No, you get to sing outside the church. Outside? - Isn't this what you're used to? They want you to go outside on the lawn to get outside of the four walls and attract newcomers. - They came up with that? - Well, I gave them some guidance but they voted for it. - Yeah, what was the vote? - It was a three to three, and whenever there's a tie, I get to vote. So, what do you say? This is exactly what I've wanted. Will you help me reach out to the community? - This is what you want? - Absolutely, this is a God send, Kris. - Well, if I can bring some fellow musicians and if you'll play the conga drums. - Done. I'll set up the PA system and all the equipment you'll need Wednesday afternoon, and we'll start playing at 6:30. The whether forecast looks great. - We've gotta show 'em. - We will, we got a secret weapon. Jesus. - Everything is turning out right. - How about that? I've got a little business to take care of near Detroit, but I'll be there Wednesday. - Okay, I gotta get the word out. This is gonna be fun, brother. - Definitely. - Bless you. - Did you hear all that, Mo? Sounds good, you should go. - Where you headed? - Belleville. - That's where I live, on Belleville Lake. - Can you tell me how long it takes to get there? - Oh, about an hour is all. We make a couple of stops along the way. - Sounds good. - Don't tell me you're gonna sleep. - No, I doubt it. - I like meeting new people is all. You've been to Belleville much? - I went fishing on the lake a couple times, years ago with my son. - I've lived there for 35 years. My daughter lives just west of Ann Arbor so I go there often, it gives me someplace to get to. - That's nice. Where are you going in Belleville, if I may ask? - Belleville Mobile Home Park, can you tell me where it is? - Yes, it's about a half an hour from the bus stop, up Sumtville Road. I'll point you in the right direction when we get there. - Beautiful. - Hello. - Don't you recognize me, Larry? - I knew this would happen. Knew what? - You'd find me. - Sorry, but I had to come, I had to see you. - Not much to see. - Me neither. The accident set me way back. - I didn't mean to, I had been driving all day. - I know, I know, I heard your testimony. - I made a terrible mistake, terrible mistake. I hate myself, I'm so sorry. - Me too, Larry, I'm so sorry for what I've done to you. - What you've done to me? - That's why I'm here to ask your forgiveness. - I'm the one who needs forgiveness. - That's why I need to apologize. You see, I worked things through, I forgave you after you'd gone to jail, but I never told you. I let you sit and suffer, and I didn't try to help you. I should've come and visited you. And I'm sorry I waited until today. I have forgiven you, Larry. You're a good man, you suffered a lot. But we both know, and God knows, it was an accident. It's taken me a long time to ease that pain in myself. - I would give my life to bring your family back. - Thank you, but my purpose for being here is to make sure you and I get our lives back. Understand? You working somewhere? - A couple months ago, I got a job as a carpenter. - Good. And what about your wife, Jeannie, is it? - It's Janie, maybe she'll come back. - If things work out, just remember to love her while you have her. - I will. I will remember. - Will you forgive me, Larry, for waiting so long? - I, I'm so glad you came when you did. - God bless you. - Goodbye, Mr. Kivi. ♫ Lord, my spirit is on fire ♫ I could feel you everywhere ♫ With your presence growing stronger ♫ I can feel you in the air ♫ Bringing healing to my heart ♫ Bringing healing to my soul ♫ Heal me father, from within ♫ Pour your spirit out again ♫ Like a mighty rushing wind ♫ Like a mighty rushing wind ♫ Like a mighty rushing wind ♫ Pour your spirit out again ♫ Like a mighty rushing wind ♫ Bringing healing to our hearts ♫ Bringing healing to our souls ♫ Heal me, Father, from within ♫ Pour your spirit out again ♫ Like a mighty rushing wind ♫ I built my house on the rock of Christ ♫ And I know my house will stand ♫ Another man turned his back on god ♫ And he built his house on sand ♫ My house on the rock will stand ♫ His house on the sand will rot ♫ When a storm comes crashing down ♫ Then your house will hit the ground ♫ I built my life on the rock of Christ ♫ That will not be destroyed ♫ Another man said he didn't believe ♫ And he built his life all wrong ♫ My life on the rock will stand ♫ His life on the sand will rot ♫ Sooner or later comes a hurricane wind ♫ The walls fall down, the hut will sink ♫ As for me and my house, we will serve the lord ♫ As for me and my house, all mighty god is ♫ As for me and my house, we will serve the lord ♫ As for me and my house, we stand on the word - I wanna thank all of you for coming. We're reaching out into the community to make a positive difference in people's lives. With that in mind, you can get a free carwash on the other side of the church building. And join us Sunday morning and we'll get your lives cleaned up and washed up in the sanctuary, and both services are free. We have with us tonight Kris Kivi and the Street People Band. Formed yesterday and christened today. But before we start the music, I've been told we have a special presentation. Will Elmer Johnson please come up? Sorry, Kris, but Eleanor, she thought giving you this present might make you sing a little bit better than usual. - You'll never know what this means to me. - You know what, it means 400 bucks to me. - What a nice gift, and a real blessing. May God bless us all as we enjoy this time together, amen. ♫ We come to gather at your ♫ We come to worship at your feet ♫ We come as sons and daughters ♫ To drink your waters ♫ We come to get caught up in the ♫ We study your holy word that should be heard ♫ To every land and every tribe ♫ Your holy scroll that wakes the soul ♫ And makes a dead man come alive ♫ Your holy truth that burns up lies are ♫ Turning darkness into light ♫ Your holy book that opens eyes and ♫ Gives a blind man perfect sight ♫ We come to offer hearts and ♫ We come to sow and surely reap ♫ We come as sons and daughters ♫ We drink up waters ♫ We come to get caught up in the name ♫ We study your holy word that should be heard ♫ In every land and every tribe ♫ Your holy scroll that wakes the soul ♫ And makes the dead man come alive ♫ Your holy truth that burns up lies ♫ By turning darkness into light ♫ Your holy book that opens eyes ♫ And gives a blind man perfect sight ♫ We come together as your ♫ We come to worship at your feet ♫ We come as sons and daughters ♫ To drink of living waters ♫ We come to get caught up in the deep ♫ We come as sons and daughters ♫ To drink of living waters ♫ We come to get caught up in the deep ♫ We come to get caught up in the deep - What is this? - A piece of your dream coming true. - It's fantastic. - You like it? - I love it. I can't believe it, who's it from? - Let's just say that Kris made a persuasive presentation to the church missions board. - So, I'm a mission, am I? - Yes, sir, feeding the hungry. - I promise I'll do my part to help the homeless. In fact, I'll give one of them a job running this food cart for me. - Beautiful. - What comes around goes around, right? - Yeah, thank you very much. God is good, my friend. - I'm starting to believe that more and more everyday. - Me, too. We'll catch you later, Kareem. - See you in church. - I'll be there, I'm kind of liking the music. - Hey, what about my preaching? - Very tasty, could use a little salt though. - It felt good, didn't it? - Lots of things are feeling good lately. How about you and your fiance, Jessica? - Oh, you'll be the first to know, we just set a date. - So, your job worked out after all, eh, Pastor? - Yes, it did. ♫ Some people share his light ♫ And leave their footprints in the sand ♫ ♫ So, will I, I, I, I ♫ So will I, I, I, I ♫ So will I, I, I ♫ So will I, I, I ♫ So will I, I, I - That's nice. - So, how's it feel to be the new music director at New Life Church? - I feel grateful. - You made it happen. - I've got a secret weapon. - The new homeless shelter is keeping people warm. God has really used you, Kris. - And that's a miracle because I was dying in this place. - And now? - Better now. I'm better, it's a place for healing now. God and people like you and the Pastor helped me rise up out of the ashes, like the phoenix, to live again, to begin again. - You know that the phoenix was mostly purple? - Kind of like you. - It's my favorite part of the story, the rising up to live again part. - Thank god for heaven. - Well, I'll leave you alone for a little while. - Okay, Becca, I'll join you in a bit. I love you all. Jesus is taking care of you. He's taking good care of me, too. Me and Mocha.
