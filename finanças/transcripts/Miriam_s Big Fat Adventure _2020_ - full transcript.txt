This programme contains some strong language. Do I take my shoes off? Yes, please. Righto. I'll take my hankies out of my pocket! Not that they weigh very much. Right. Shall I step on? Yes, please. OK. So, we now put in your age. 78. Yeah. And if you stay where you are we should get a small printout. So what's my body mass... Mass index. It's 41.6. So I'm morbidly obese. Is that what it's called? If that's the terminology you want to use. No. What do you call it? SCOTTISH ACCENT: Bloody fat! After a lifetime of worrying about my weight, I wanted to come to terms with my body. I'm only four foot 11. But somehow, over 78 years, I've managed to eat my way to 14st 10lb. I look like a sumo wrestler! And I'm not the only one. You're not a small person yourself, are you? No. No, I'm not. The country weighs more than ever before. I steal food. Can I ask what it is you steal? Chocolate? I was on a mission to understand why we're doing it to ourselves. Is she right? How extraordinary! And what it's doing to us. Argh! There's times that I, like, start punching my pillow because I'm just so angry with myself. I was entering a controversial world where people took things to extremes. Don't you think your, erm, twingle is a bit loose? A little bit, yes. And sometimes had to face the consequences. See, I've got all this. A world where coming to terms with what you're doing to yourself... So you don't care that you're fat? No. CHEERING Means you might have to come to terms with yourself. THEY CHANT I'm happy with who I am. I'm happy with my face. I'm happy with my life. I am disgusted by my body. I loathe it. If I could migrate my whole personality and my face onto another body, I would be delighted. Whose body would you like to inhabit? Claudia Winkleman. I fully understand that most people would say, "Get over yourself and stop eating." It's not so simple. I keep trying to do things about it. I've gone on diets all my life. I worry about it all the time. And whenever I go into a food shop, I think, "I mustn't have that. "I mustn't have that." It's a constant battle. It's difficult being fat. It's a hard, miserable fate, and I'm sure that there are loads and loads of fat people who would agree with me. They might not want to be perfect, but they don't want to be fat. And they're right. It seems we've become a nation of humungous arses, sagging bellies and pendulous bosoms. And according to the internet, nearly a third of people in the UK are officially obese. I wanted to know why. I decided to start with people who are fighting back against fat. And I knew exactly where to find them. A health farm. The main rule when you go to a health farm is limiting the amount that you eat and increasing the amount of exercise. You're prepared to eat less? Of course I'm prepared to eat less. That's absolutely essential. I've booked in for two full days at Team Bootcamp, where they fight obesity with a military-inspired regime. Oh, what a lovely house! I wanted to find out why the campers' weight had got so out of control that they needed such an extreme intervention. Hello. Hello! Let me clamber out. Come on in! Right. What a nice place! So, first of all, my name's Craig. This is Paula. We set up Team Bootcamp about six years ago. Are you lovers? Yeah, we're husband and wife. Oh, right. So we're not lovers any more. We're not lovers any more! We've been married for six years. What is your background, may I ask? So my background, I spent over 12 years in the Royal Marines. And I think the military does give you self-discipline. The majority of campers that come and stay here would say, "I just wish I had more discipline, self-discipline." The reason why bootcamp works well is we strip choice away from you. The way we describe it is "hard on the outside", and then Paula brings the soft and nurturing on the inside. I have, for a big proportion of my life, been a big, big girl. I was 20st at my heaviest, and also suffering from a lot of kind of mental health problems. And so I did loads of research on how to be happy. And then finally woke up one day and realised, you know what? You have to make yourself happy. At bootcamp, campers are left with only one decision - where to sleep. £600 gets you a week in a tent in the garden. £1,400 gets you the executive suite. So this is you, just here. VOICEOVER: I don't DO tents. How beautiful is that? Do you want a cup of tea or something? I'd like a cup of hot water. Is that allowed? Yes, it is! There you go. Thank you. It's really hot, actually. So, let's have a look at you. I mean... ..what do you weigh now? I weigh 12 and a half stone. And where have you lost it most? Everywhere. Apart from my legs - I have heavy legs. But you see, I haven't. My legs are sort of... You've got nice legs! They're sort of diddy legs, aren't they? See, I get terrible leg envy. Leg envy? I do get leg envy! Well, you're not havin' mine, love! I do. But it is what it is, isn't it? I think that as soon as somebody says, "I was fat and here I am, "look at me now," you think, "Wow, that's authentic." Because it's no good, some little willowy thing undulating towards you and saying, "You can have a body like me," because you know fine well you can't. Everything at bootcamp runs on military time. There is absolutely no unsupervised eating, and portion control is strictly regulated by chef and bootcamp graduate Ricky. Hello. Can I come and investigate? You certainly may! You certainly may. Come on in. You came to lose weight? Yeah, I came because I'd actually got to the point where I was 35st. 35st?! Yeah, 35st. So I've lost about 13 and a half stone in total now. Have you got some before photos? I do have. I have one from the day I got to camp. Oh, show us. There we go. What prompted you to come here? Was it a realisation of imminent death or something? It was a lot, actually, quite a big combination of things. I lost my job. My parents decided to get divorced after 35 years together. And because of the divorce I moved out of the family home and was living with friends. And it became a cycle of just waking up, going to the shops, buying copious amounts of rubbish, going back to their house, sitting watching TV and eating that rubbish all day. I think I put on about five, 6st in three months. I couldn't go to the toilet properly, I couldn't shower myself properly. It really had got to that point, a point that I really never thought I'd ever get to. So coming here was really a chance for me to sit and reflect and actually change who I am and the way I think. There we go. Thank you. So is this the suggested portion size for...? ALL: Yes. If you were at home and you, erm, being who you were, let's say, what would this meal be? A lot bigger. Three times the size, yeah. A big dinner plate, yeah. I would binge. Yeah. So, like, one of my biggest binges I ever had was two large pizzas from Pizza Hut. The chicken goujons, the garlic bread. And, to top it off, I had the ice cream with a two-litre bottle of Coke, and I ate that in about a three-hour sitting. So coming from that to come to this, you see exactly what your body actually needs. Do you think that society's rough on fat people? Yeah. Yeah. Meeting people is especially hard because you know the first thing they'll see is how big you are. Yeah. I agree. Oh, thank you. I get to like people very quickly and they've opened themselves to me so sweetly here. They've exposed their vulnerabilities. Obesity. It's a pit that you fall into and you scrabble and scrabble and try to get out. And, really, they're being shown a ladder and they're climbing it. Training will start at 9:00 in the morning, with every camper facing five and a half hours of physical exercise every day. How was it, the first night? Oh, I slept well. It's very comfortable. Are you ready for some rigorous exercise? Yes, I-I'll certainly watch! No, I'm quite looking forward to it. Excuse I. Sorry! So when the trainer comes out, we'll stand up and do a register, and then it's straight on with the... Yeah. OK, guys. Let's line out, then. Nice straight line. Stand up. Come on. It's not Butlin's. The one rule that you all should be aware of now is that our feet are constantly moving. To start off with, I'm happy for you to do something like this. Were you sporty as a kid? I was never sporty as a kid. Jogging around, nice and light. Loosen off the fingers a little bit. I was always the very last person to be chosen in a team. As we're jogging around, then, I just want to you sort of high fiving people that you pass. And that is quite humiliating, to be the very last person. Keep it nice and tight. Light on the feet. Just as I was the very last person at the school dance. Going to go straight into a floss. Who can do the floss? Anyone? And I was always the wallflower that was stuck longest to the side of the wall. It's a humiliation you don't forget. And it means that really early on in life you learn the pain of rejection because your body isn't wanted. I'm just going to sit down... Yeah, sit down for a bit. ..for a minute. Three, two, one, sprint! Let's go! SHOUTS OF ENCOURAGEMENT That's not for me. I can just keep trying to move. CRAIG SHOUTS ENCOURAGEMENT Excellent! Love the little relay we've got going on here. This is my bootcamp! Let's go. GENERAL CHATTER Guys are walking - come on, let's job. Be ready. Charlie, take charge! Come on, let's go! Much better. Will, hang in there. I am so breathless with admiration for you all! It's stunning, what you're doing. Is any of it fun? Yes! Yeah. Is it? Some of it's fun! No! Argh! Nice! Good! Keep the chest up. And five... Fuck it. Yes! Well done! It's my back, you see. Well done. I'm damaged goods, darling, you've got to understand. We all are! I'm not just 78. I'm 78 and fucked, basically! TRAINER CHORTLES They are forcing people to see life in a completely different way. But that's what they've been asked to do. This is your finish. You finish it. These people here want to be controlled. They are giving up their freedom in return for a vision of themselves... ..that they think they might achieve. Will is the newest recruit in bootcamp. After five years at the private boarding school Harrow and a year at university, he's grown to 28st. I wanted to know why he'd let his weight get out of control. Will! Yeah? Come and have a chat with me. Sure. You interest me very much. Oh, thank you. You want to lose weight because...? Loads of reasons. Self-confidence. I don't want to be at uni and my friends come to me and say, "Let's go canoeing," and I say, "Oh, God, I wonder if the boat's going to be able "to handle me." Do you know what I mean? That kind of thing. I know exactly what you mean. Yeah. I don't want my weight to get in the way of me having fun, or getting into a relationship or anything that. What are the things that hold you back? I think it's me just being self-destructive. I mean, it's all mental. I've struggled with stress, I've struggled with anxiety. Going to the schools that I went to, it was always a really pressurised environment. And it sucks, because, like, I really want to get in shape. I really want to do this for myself. And then I don't, and then I'm so angry at myself, and it gets exhausting. There's times that I'm in bed and I, like, start punching my pillows. Or scream into pillows. I'm just so angry with myself. I feel as if I'm listening to myself because I have an exercise bike in my house. Yeah. I know that if I go first thing in the morning... Uh-huh... I will go on it. And I find ways not to go. To not go. It's my situation. I know it so well. But to be fat at 78 is ridiculous. To be fat at 20 and to be doing something about it, I think it's good. I just hope with all my heart that he sticks with it. Off you go! Training is accompanied by compulsory daily therapy. Today, campers are working on visualising a positive future. It looks like very confident and very like, on the go. And very much ready for anything. The aim is to retrain residents for a thinner life in six weeks, but some campers end up staying a lot longer. Georgia's been here almost a year, and works part-time to pay her way. She struggles with the most common eating disorder - bingeing. Before I left, I wanted to find out why she was unable to return to normal life. So that was when I first started camp. So that was August last year and camp was my last hope, in a way. I came to camp at about 21st. Shit! That IS a lot. Yeah. I was... That's a lot! I got told that I looked like a thumb. Who told you that? Some boy. I hope you got hold of his testicles and squeezed them till his eyes watered. But when I look back, I did. What happened that you...? So, I've struggled with my weight my entire life. And then, when I went to university, I put on about 10st. You must have worked very hard to put on 10st. Erm, I ate a lot of pizzas and takeaways. And I did a lot of bingeing. So, once... And you didn't move much? No, I didn't move at all. Stayed in my room, in my house, became a bit of a recluse. I do suffer with depression and anxiety, and that had a bit to do with it but, yeah. As I got bigger, the less I wanted to go out and do things. What was your bingeing? What did you do? It would be a 2:00 am drive to McDonald's drive-thru. And I'd order wherever special burger they'd have with the fries, a chocolate milkshake. Then I'd order a Big Mac, and then I'd order three Double Cheeseburgers and two Chicken Mayo burgers. And I'd sit in my car and I'd eat all of that. What have you learnt here that has helped you? That it is an addiction. For me personally, it's the first bite. That's where the happiness comes from. Because when you're eating, you're not thinking about whatever it is that's upset you or frustrated you. You're all focused on that food and you've forgotten how you're going to feel afterwards. Because afterwards, you never feel great. It's still there and I still binge. But my win is that it's four chocolate bars. It's not four burgers with an extra side of another four burgers. It's quite complicated, losing weight, isn't it? Trying to. Yes. Right. Most people don't understand that it's in your head. It's not in your tummy. It's in your head. But society is not sympathetic. Society is a bugger. Society is hurtful and cruel. And I hope that they've got the strength to be able to say, I'm not worthy of being despised and don't laugh at me in the street. At bootcamp, the campers were protected, but when they finally left, they'd have to be ready to deal with society's disdain for the overweight on their own. The accepted way of looking at the world is that you have to be thin, and when you're not thin, you're made to feel that you're not good. And that is a tough psychological burden to have to carry. Some people are now espousing a movement called body positive and they say, "I'm fat. Face it. "Deal with it. I'm not prepared to. "It's your problem, world, not mine." There's a woman on the world wide web called Bethany. She's an anti-diet, plus-sized activist with a doughnut tattooed on her tummy. To be fat and happy goes against everything I've always believed possible, but I was intrigued. Hello. Hello! Nice to meet you. I'm Miriam. Nice to meet you. I'm Bethany. WAITER CHATS Thank you. So you don't care that you're fat? No, I don't care. It doesn't distress you. No. You don't worry about it. No. You refuse to know your weight. Yes. You're not interested in your weight. No. Your attitude to it, has it changed over the years? Yeah. I think I did find it harder when I was younger. And then, the older I've got, the more I've kind of found what I really feel, rather than what I'm kind of meant to feel about my body. What do you think you're meant to feel? Shame and difficulty and unhappiness. Have people been horrid? Yeah, of course. I mean, it's not like I live in some kind of other fantasy world where I don't experience all the same, like, rubbish stuff. It's just, I don't know, I feel like I know that they're wrong. I don't feel bad about myself. I, personally, don't feel like I am a bad person, like I'm unattractive, like I don't deserve love and friendship and an interesting life and a fulfilling career and all of this stuff. But it is a fact that being fat is a strain on your body. So it seems a bit wilful of you not to take that on board. We know from various studies that long-term, large amounts of weight loss are not sustainable, that if you track, like, people that have lost a large amount of weight for more than two years, something like 2% of them keep it off. If you don't keep it off, you're in the cycle of kind of crash... On and off? On and off, which is so dangerous for your heart. And I cannot get behind the idea of, like, regretting years of my life that I spent worrying about what I was eating or whether I was going to enough spin classes or whatever. That's just so sad to me. It is sad. Yeah. Because, like, you hating your body for however many years, it hasn't made you thin or happy. I'm not sure if Bethany's correct. Most medical advice is agreed - being fat is not healthy. But Bethany had managed something I never had. She'd made being fat a positive part of who she was, although, as she admitted, she still had to deal with society's ridicule. You doing some homework, are you? Yeah. I'm trying to find out whether being fat is really funny. JIMMY CARR: Of course, not all fat people are jolly. Some of them are women. AUDIENCE LAUGHS Fat girls have got feelings. Mainly, they're hungry. Watching Jimmy Carr having a go, a whole theatre full of people laughs. It's only a joke, isn't it? It's only a bit of fun. I told it the other night and a girl got up and walked out. Well, waddled out. Oh, dear. I presume offended, possibly just peckish. AUDIENCE LAUGHS Jimmy thinks that fat people are hysterical because they waddle. They don't walk. They waddle. They're walking out because they're hungry, not because that they don't think he's any good. I do laugh, but at the same time, I think it's shitty. I mean, there is no doubt that it is a prejudice against fat people and it's a prejudice that everybody who isn't fat is prepared to join in with. It's a nasty way of exposing fat people. I do notice fat people. See, there's a fat lady. She's fat, too. Every other group, you know, blacks and gays and trans, they're quite vocal, but fat people are a silent majority. We don't have a voice because we're ashamed. With fat people keeping quiet, society gets away with publicly ridiculing them. But I wondered if society itself was keeping quiet about deeper, darker prejudices. Dr Eric is a behavioural psychologist, leading the research into how a person's mental health might become damaged, simply by being obese. Hello. Hi, there. Hi. I'm Miriam. Nice to meet you. Yeah, you as well. What do you know about being fat? I know plenty, but you're pretty slender! When thin people see fat people, what have you found is their response? So, the research that we've done suggests that it's common to attribute stereotypes to people of heavier body weight. You know, lazy, greedy, lacking self-control. And I think one of the reasons is because of what we're fed by media about what's success, and that's a thin body shape, and what's failure, and that's a heavier body weight. And that seeps into our consciousness over time and changes the way we think. Dr Eric's latest research investigates whether society's contempt makes the obese self-destructive. For this, he analyses his students' behaviour when they're made fat with the use of prosthetics. Miriam, nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. You're very tiny! So you've no idea what it's like to be fat. No. So are we talking about a fat suit that you're going to wear? You put it like that, it doesn't sound very scientific, but that's exactly what it is. The idea is that when you put it on and wear it, you look like you're overweight. Eric is a psychologist. He's not so much interested in the hanging tits and the hanging belly. He's interested in the effect that that has on the life of the fat person. Oh, my God! NERVOUS LAUGHTER Hello, fatty! Well, go out and have fun being fat. There's a popular idea that stigmatising people somehow makes them change their life and dramatically lose weight. Snap out of it. Exactly. The research shows that, actually, people who experience stigma are more likely to go on and develop more serious health problems. They gain more weight. So there's a bad reaction. Which is not at all surprising if you think about what humans are like. We're inherently social creatures. We care about what people think of us. Social exclusion, social rejection, they hurt. The other psychological effect, it's called internalising. Over time, the idea that fatness equals failure becomes ingrained and it changes how you think about yourself. Self-esteem plummets downwards. You have gradually accepted the messages that you're no good and that you're not going to succeed. So how was it? Erm, it was interesting because obviously, it's graduation today. And I felt like I was a very stark contrast to them. Uh-huh. Because they were all very glamorous, very slim, and I felt very self-conscious. I felt that if I was kind of graduating next year, I wouldn't feel comfortable. Yeah. Which is incredibly similar to what lots of people with obesity report experiencing. If you have that chronic belief that people might judge you negatively because of the way you look, and that's quite stressful, and something that can impact on mental health as well. Dr Eric's research is part of a worldwide study that actually shows that the disdain society holds for the obese is deeply embedded. Participants are shown the famous evolutionary scale that represents the ascent of man. And so, in the study, what we say to participants is, where would you rate different people on this scale of evolution? Oh, God! Right. So where they'd put a person with normal weight would be here, the top end of the evolutionary scale. When we ask people, well, how evolved and how human do you think people with obesity are? Then a proportion of people put a person with obesity further down, closer to a primitive, unevolved ape than a human. I find that offensive. Mm-hm. Mm-hm. We're not just ugly and smelly and greedy and lazy. We're actually subhuman as well. We haven't evolved. That IS hard to bear. I've developed a strategy for being fat. I say, "I'm fat. "Notice me because I'm fat. "Don't bug me about it. "And I wish I weren't." Is it effective? Up to a point. Yes, I think it is effective. It's not effective because I'm still fat. It would be more effective if I weren't! A recent study found that, if you're obese, you're 45% more likely to be depressed. And it's middle-aged men who struggle the most with their weight. I was off to meet a 39-year-old called John, whose obesity had left him a social recluse until he found the answer - football. Man V Fat is a weekly football league that combines dieting and chasing a ball. I wanted to know if losing weight meant you could lose your mental struggles too. Hi! I'm John. Hiya. I'm Miriam. Hi. Are you the fattest? Who's the fattest? I probably was when I started. Were you? Yeah, possibly! How much have you lost? 10st. There or thereabout. You must have been a big boy. I was. But... I mean, I don't understand how you could run if you were 10st heavier. When we started I don't think I did, did I? No. It was... He just strolled about, did he? Yeah. How long have you been doing it? Nearly two years now. Are you married? Yes. Is she a big woman? Yeah. She just given birth to our baby. Oh, well, you can manage to get it up then, can't you? LAUGHTER I can now! Bit of a problem before. We were trying for a baby for ten years. Never happened. Do you think that was because of the weight? Well, my wife thinks so. Whenever you're ready, mate. Feeling good this week? Yeah. How much have you lost? 2.1kg. That's four pounds? That's four-and-a-half pounds. Four-and-a-half pounds. Oh, that's a lot! Great week, yeah. Yeah. You look forward to this? Yeah. It's sort of rolling back the years, really. You get to play football. Get to know each other. We've got a WhatsApp group where we support each other. Have a chat. You sound just like girls, because women are good at getting together and talking. And I never thought men were. But... I don't think, if it wasn't for this, I would talk about it. Normally, dieting is kind of, you're screwed up to it and you don't really want to do it. But they want to do this. They're encouraging each other. They're having fun doing it. You know, we know that you've got to move more, but they're moving together. And that's the thing. They're doing it together. GENERAL CLAMOUR When you hear about fat football, you think they're just going to be little snails, kind of going very, very slowly along a pitch. Far from it. These guys are pelting down! It's not a soft option. They mean business. And I don't think they're thinking about whether they're fat or not when they run - they want that bloody ball. That's what they want. The men were revelling in their own safe space. John's team wasn't due to play until the end of the evening. His wife, Kelly, lived round the corner. I went to find out how John's weight loss had transformed their lives. Hello! Hello, I'm Kelly. Oh, good. I'm Miriam. Hi, Miriam. Nice to meet you. And you. Come on in. Come on in. Thank you very much. This is Freddie. Hello, Freddie! Oh! This is a chance for girl talk without your lovely John! Yeah! What a nice man! He is, yeah. You're not a small person yourself? No! No, I'm not. No, no. When did you meet? We met on an online dating site. So it was still very taboo at that point. That was 2006. When you saw him coming through the restaurant door or whatever it was, did you think, Blimey O'Reilly? Yeah, I was a bit, I was shocked that he was bigger than I thought he was. But I had it in the back of my head the chats that we'd had. So I sort of looked past that. The fact that he was overweight... Uh-huh. Didn't, it didn't... Didn't stop your gonads? No! I put it! No, no. You thought, "Ooh, I like him"? Yeah. He was just, he was lovely to me. And that's what... Yeah, I didn't care that he was fat. You saw the man... Yeah. ..behind the blubber. I did. Yes. So to speak. Yes. I'd like to see photos. Yeah? I've got a picture over there. OK. I'll grab it. Oh, that's divine, isn't it? That little face of his! It's so gorgeous! I know! Coming out of that bulk! I know. I know! But until now, John was very like closed within about it. He knew what he was like. He knew he was fat. Yeah. But he couldn't talk about it? No. He was terrible, terrible self-conscious about it. So he's getting more confident? Yes. Incredibly. His just whole persona, his whole being has just changed and he's not unhappy any more. And that's because he lost weight? Yeah, yeah. And I've put it down that we conceived Freddie because John lost a lot of weight at that time. They say that the sperm count in an overweight man can be lower. Yeah. So it's possible. Yes. Say hello? Say hello! What do you think would have happened if John hadn't slimmed off and played football and changed his life? I think we'd have still been together, I think. But not as happy, maybe? No. No. We're definitely a very happy family. You are. WHISPERS: You're a happy family! You're a happy family! There never has been a clearer example of how weight loss can transform lives. It's about two people falling in love and having a gap in their lives. PLAYERS SHOUT And the weight loss transforms itself into a baby. Marvellous! Magic, really! One of the tragedies of fatness is that people see us differently, and that really pisses me off. Because there's no reason why people should not allow fat people to have romance in their lives. But somehow, it's not attractive to the ordinary person. So they pretend it can't happen and doesn't happen. And it does, and it will, and it should. MIRIAM CHEERS You weren't moving terribly fast towards the end, were you? I saw you being a bit conservative with the movement. Yeah, but I'm moving a lot more than I used to, so I... Oh, I bet you are. Football, love, and losing weight seem to be allowing John to fit back into society and get the life he wanted. He was going to the pub with his team-mates. I wanted to know how damaged he'd been. You were really unhappy being fat, weren't you? Yeah. Just before I started Man v Fat, I went to get petrol at a petrol station. And the person behind the counter says to me, "How much do you weigh?" Like, I don't know him. And how did you feel when he said that? Terrible. Would you say that your mental health was affected by the way they laughed? It got me down. I felt depressed, but I just went back in my shell. That was my protection. But, yeah. It probably did put me in a bit of a dark place. Did you feel that women wouldn't be interested in you because you were fat? No, I'm still good-looking. No, I'm joking! Well, you are. I found Kelly and it sort of fell into place. I didn't see what she found attractive, but she says she fell in love with the personality. Why didn't you see? When you don't feel good about yourself, why would anyone else? You know, when I was younger - and I've always been fat - I was always sure that nobody would ever want to go to bed with me because I was fat. Would you fuck a fat girl? I can't see why not! Not in... Not... Well, I've got a girlfriend. Been with her for nearly 11 years. So, there's no way... No, no, you're not in the market. But would most men? I don't think they would, would they? As long as they're a nice person and I find them attractive. Well, I'm encouraged! I thought they were prepared to be serious in a way that I wasn't expecting. And John was endearingly open about his weight and the effect it had had on his life, and the effect that losing weight had had on his life, which was entirely positive. For John, weight loss seemed to be the answer. When I met Georgia, she'd already lost 7st, but had been unable to leave bootcamp because she was still trying to deal with her bingeing and mental struggles. Georgia was home for a weekend with her mother. I wanted to know if they thought she was ever going to get better. Be quiet! DOG WHINES Hello! Hello! Lovely to see you! Come in, I've got a load of dog. I love dogs! So that's gorgeous. This is my mama. Sheila. Hello! Very pleased to meet you. I'm Miriam. So I've just popped home for a few days. Come and see the mama and my dog. And we've just been to a family wedding. Did you see things that you wanted to eat? Yeah, and I ate them. But I just didn't eat, like, there was cheesecake. So I had slice, like a normal person, instead of a whole cheesecake. And you could manage that? Yes. Yeah. There was a lot of food. That's, don't you think that's...? There was a lot of food. I did eat... That's an amazing thing. I did eat a lot. Of course, she, second helpings and third and fourth helpings. Why do you think you binge? Self-harm? It's just another form of self-harm. Can you tell if it's a binge day? No. Yes. Yes. No. I could tell. Yes. In the past... Hang on. Is it no or yes? I'd be hard to push to find a binge day now. But, yes, I could tell it was a binge day. How? Why? How could you tell? Withdrawn, secretive. Isn't that something? If I don't make eye contact with you, Mum, you won't know I'm lying. Is she right? How extraordinary! But I couldn't have said to her, "You are not to go out and get food." Because I'd get double the amount, then. Yes. And you knew that? I learned that. Gosh! It's quite mad, really, on my part. Yes. You weren't well. Yeah, but that can still happen again. I can still go to that place. But I don't want to. Do you think that the family had any part in creating this? It's very difficult when I have two others who are not binge eaters but there must be something there. You're a parent. You must take on that responsibility somewhere. If you had advice for parents, what would you say? I don't know. Trust them. Have faith in them. Give them time. Are you allowed ice cream? I am allowed whatever I choose to have! Are you? Yes. Whatever we choose to have! Do you want a Flake? Do you want a Flake in yours? Definitely! Yes. Two Flakes as well. This is very good, isn't it? Two Flakes! You got two Flakes! Yeah. I'm going to have this Flake and then I'm going to get rid of the rest. Will you enjoy it? I will enjoy the Flake. If you could meet your ten-year-old self, what would you say? Be kinder to yourself. Not everything is your fault. Sometimes things just happen. And that's OK and you'll be OK. She's really a splendid girl, isn't she? She is. I was very struck when Georgia just said that bingeing was the equivalent of self-harming. Yes. Every time she put something in her mouth that was extra to what she was eating, it was like she was abusing her body. Every can of Coke, every bit of chocolate, every burger, was a suicide tablet that she was putting in her mouth. And you are powerless, you are helpless. She was so obese, so ill with depression, that I didn't think that she would live to see, say, her 30th birthday, which she's just had this year. And now when you see her, how do you feel? Relieved, I think. Proud of her. I bet you are! Proud of her. Obesity is something that people laugh at, but when you talk to those two, it's not funny. It's heartache. And it's also real terror because she thought that she could lose her daughter. And that's not something people think about. You just think, you know, too many cream buns. Pull yourself together. There's so much more to it. Georgia had made massive progress, but believed her happiness relied on becoming mentally stronger and continuing to lose weight. I'd begun to think that turning yourself slim may not simply turn your life around. I went to see my best friend Carol to try and make sense of it all. Hello! Hello! It's open! Oh, is it? Hello! How you doing? I'm all right. How are you? All the better for seeing you! Definitely. When I first met you, which was in 1968, you were a little elfin thing. I know I was. And I put on weight, but I've lost a lot subsequently. Yeah, you have. I've lost over 2st. I think I've become accustomed to smaller portions. That's my problem. I know it is. You don't have a stop button. Like everything else has become encased in the fat. Thank you. Carol's always telling me off. That's one of the parts of our relationship that has remained constant! She knows what I'm like, but she still likes me. Can you imagine me slim? MIRIAM CHUCKLES It's difficult. That's called a curved ball, I think. Erm... I AM a curved ball! You ARE a curved ball. Yes! I can imagine you slimMER, but slim? No. You would lose an enormous amount of personality if you were slim. Would I? Would I actually lose personality? I mean... That's awful. No, what you are is a little powerhouse. And I think if you were slim, some of the power might go. Well, I'm not eating too much now. I've had an elegant sufficiency. It was, but it was twice as much as I had. No, it wasn't! I don't believe you. You ate half what I ate? Yes. I'm quite upset to hear that. Why did you give me twice as much as you had? Because I knew you'd eat it. Well, I think that's awful. Sorry, but if I'd put the same portion on there that I had, you'd have said, "Can I have some more?" No, I wouldn't because I'd have been... Oh, yes, you would have. Well, I might have. I might have. You might well have. Love you lots. You take care. I mean, nobody wants to think that their personality is residing in globules of fat. But I think if I were thin, I would be quieter. I think being fat makes me noisy. Maybe Carol was right. Maybe everyone wouldn't be improved by being thinner. I decided to go back to school to meet a body confidence activist called Trina. Trina had just appeared as a plus-sized model in a nationwide advert, and she was trying to teach the children that being slim was not the only way to be happy. The girls are there, waiting... OK... if you want to come through. Hello, everybody. ALL: Hello. Trina, you and me, we're the only fat people here. LAUGHTER So "slim" isn't a word that interests you particularly? No, no. Slim doesn't interest me at all. Not one bit. I just want you, in pairs, to list as many beauty standards as you can. Curvy. But not, like, curvy, but, like, curvy. What's happened is that they're seeing the glorification of how these women or men are being celebrated by looking this certain way. I'm absolutely fascinated by "big bum." That is the very last thing I would have thought. Yeah. Big bum? Yeah, boys are attracted to big bums nowadays. When you're seeing that having a curvy body, having a big bum and then being very popular kind of goes hand in hand, then it's like it's something that they want to attain. This is me over here in the recent TU clothing advert. Often when people who are overweight share their experience, it always comes from a very negative place. So I feel like it's important to share that not everybody who is bigger is unhappy. Personally, in relation to what you've written down in your list, I don't think I really tick those boxes. I've got cellulite here. I haven't got that hourglass. My belly's hanging out. I haven't got a flat stomach. And yet still, my booty and my body is, like, blasted all over the UK. My experience has taught me that people who are fat and say they're happy are kidding themselves. Is that because of what other people think about them or how they think about themselves? I think it's about what society is telling fat people... OK. ..that they don't fit in. And I said, "You know what, I look good! I look good." And then came the comments. Oh, no! "Ugh, she looks fat. "She's spreading obesity. "This is disgusting." Body-shaming after body-shaming after body-shaming. I think there's many things that make you happy apart from your size. To me, it's not so much about what is on the outside, it's what's on the inside which I think is so important. If somebody ever says to me, you know, "You are fat," it's like, "Well, I'm not fat. I have fat, but that's not who I am "because what I am is a beautiful black woman, thank you very much." Well, you are! The minute I saw Trina, I fell in love with her. Oh, yeah, she's fat, all right. But she's so much more than that. You don't look at the fat. You look at the fun. I never believed that you could be fat and happy. But she may be changing my mind for me. Trina runs a haven for plus-sized women. She believes that if you can get big bodies in motion, you can change minds, and maybe the world. LOUD MUSIC PLAYS WHOOPING MUSIC STOPS Hi, Miriam! You're seeing me in a very different setting, aren't you? How are you? It's going to be very loud in here. I know, I'm going to put my fingers in my ears. If at any point you want to get up and join in... It's not my thing, darling. Well, you're welcome to, OK? We have a guest in the room, so everyone say hi to Miriam in the corner. ALL: Hi! We're going to do some strutting. And that's just because I'm bored of people acting like big girls can't be sexy, we can't look good, we can't work our hips, cos we can, honey. OK? Yes, we can. Five, six, seven, let's go. MUSIC PLAYS If you actually were unprepared for the size and proximity of some of those buttocks and some of those bosoms and some of those bellies, it could give you a bit of a turn. But when you rise above the bellies and the bosoms and see the faces and the dancing eyes, you know that it's a good thing. Grab some water, have a break, stretch your legs. That must have been fun. It was, you should try it. In the mirror, like, "OK..." In my first class I actually cried, especially doing that, touching yourself. Because it's so liberating? Yeah, because I wasn't OK with touching myself or even exposing this much skin. But coming to this class, I actually got to discover who I am. And it's my body to touch, it's my body to take control of. MUSIC: Get Busy by Sean Paul # Shake that thing, Miss Kana Kana Shake that thing, Miss Annabella # Shake that thing yan Donna Donna... # Five, six, seven, go! They've created their world and they're happy in it. And they're all the same. They're all fat girls. When you're among your own kind, you feel strong and safe. I'm just very interested in what Trina has got to offer to these girls. So why are you all here? To be empowered. Yeah. Why weren't you empowered before? Because society has these ideals and I don't fit that ideal. Out there, it's a different world. You can be on the tube, yeah, every other poster is about diet pills. Nothing wrong with skinny, but there's nothing wrong with me either. It's great that when you build up confidence here, you can bring it to the outside. And if you walked in and people look and stare, you're like, "Sorry, babe, I'm walking, don't stop me." LAUGHTER You get that from here. You're unapologetic. Sometimes I go out and it's about being unapologetically sexy, like, I am who I am. We are all so sexy and once you own that and you take that for yourself, yeah, no one can get you. It's also about the reprogramming of society, because as we become more confident in this space, we also go out and take that out there. Reprogramming, changing the world one big girl at a time. OTHERS: Yeah! APPLAUSE And it is our job here to tell you, whatever you look like, you can be happy in whatever size you are. You can be fat and happy? Most definitely! What?! Look at me, honey! OTHERS EXCLAIM You've seen fat and happy today. I have always thought that you couldn't be fat and happy. I have believed that. And now I've come here, I'm really not sure that I was right, because you are happy. And sexy, I can see that. WHOOPING It's thrilling to see people owning themselves. And you've taught me to go, sort of, you know... CHEERING AND WHOOPING APPLAUSE ALL: Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Thank you! Thank you. That was great. Bye-bye! Bye-bye. I've come out feeling quite invigorated because when you're with happiness, it spills over, and they were happy. They've all suffered from being fat and they decided that they weren't going to suffer any more. There's a definite defiance. There's a shift of power. And they've said to themselves and to the world, "Yes, I am fat and I'm loving it." The ladies were starting to make me realise I might be wasting my life pointlessly loathing my body when there was another way to be happy. Will had just finished six weeks at bootcamp. I wanted to know if he'd discovered his own way to find happiness. Hello! Hello! Welcome, how are you? You look great. Thank you very much. Hello. Hello, I'm Miriam. I'm Jen. May I ask you, how much weight have you lost? The six weeks that I was there, I have lost just under four stone. Yeah. Wow. So it was a lot. It was a lot. You did say that you thought that being a bit smaller would help you to find a woman. Mmm. So how's it going? Well, you know, it's actually going pretty well. I'm not gonna lie. Don't... stop. There were a couple of interesting people in the camp. Have you had sex in the camp? Don't ask that! I'm not answering that! You don't have to. It's just, a woman has to ask, you know. You would be surprised at how often it does happen, because as people lose weight at the camp, they get more confident. So it's a knocking shop as well as everything else? It does happen! But there have been improvements, shall we say. Isn't that great? I know. It's amazing. I think you're a remarkable young man. Thank you. Don't you feel very, very proud? I am. I am enormously proud of him. Yeah. This is brilliant. He's brilliant. His sisters will laugh because they think I think that far too much. Mummy's little prince. Mummy's prince? Mummy's prince, yeah. You're not little. No. And you're not large. You have done well. So pleased to see you looking gorgeous. I think you've got a great future ahead. Thank you very much. Bye-bye. He didn't only lose weight, Will lost the nonsense in his head. The sun's come out on him. It's wonderful. I'm only halfway through this journey, but it's changing me. I came into this thinking that I was going to find the answer to obesity and that it would work for everybody. But there isn't one answer for everybody. One size doesn't fit all. I need to explore further. This is the first time I'm realising that there's a lot of factors, and it's made me more sympathetic to people who are fat and angrier with people who are cruel to other people who are fat. If you're mean about fat people, I hate you. I hope you wither on the vine. With fat threatening to break the NHS, the Government tries to cure the future obese. And I meet a mini me... I steal food. Can I ask what it is you steal? Chocolate. ..And discover how we're being drawn into a quest for body perfection. So I've got all this. It's replacing one obsession with another. It's not just paring down of food, it's paring down of life. And I didn't sign up for that. Well, I'm going to revisit my past. SHE LAUGHS What a little angel I was! That's Miriam, aged about three. What a little charmer! You don't, erm, look fat there. No, I don't look fat there. Well, that was 75 years ago, darling! I look fat now! Last time, I discovered that despite everything I'd ever believed, it is possible to be fat and happy. That is hysterical! I think that is actually a bridesmaid's outfit and I look slim. I'm only four foot 11, but somehow over 78 years, I've managed to eat my way to 14st 10lb, and it's crippling me. There's two chins there. Now, I'm off to investigate how, when we live in a world that's become obsessed with achieving body perfection... I've still got all this. ..the country's becoming fatter than ever before. All there is is this awful image in my head of my body. With obesity threatening to break the NHS, I wanted to find out if our future is doomed... What a face I had! What a lovely face. ..or if swapping one obsession with another may lead us all to the answer. Bloody Aida! Hello! Darling girl! Hello! The world seems to be full of people in Lycra, all in pursuit of perfection. I confess that I would like to have a six pack, and a rippling body, but it's so far from the realms of possibility, and I know I haven't looked after my body. I've eaten too much, too often, of the wrong things. And my six pack has disappeared in a mass of fat and flesh, never to be seen again. I'm not the only one who's forgotten to exercise. Obesity-related illnesses like high blood pressure, type two diabetes and certain cancers cost the NHS over £6 billion a year. That's more than the police, the Fire Service and the judicial system combined. I wanted to understand if there's any way to stop the crisis. I decided to start with someone who knew the true cost of obesity. Hi, Angela. How are you doing? Hello. Not bad, how are you? I'm good. Are you ready to come in? Yeah. Are you happy to wheel yourself? Come on, then. Angela's just 41. Two years ago, she had to have her leg amputated. Hello. Hello. How lovely to meet you. You too. I'm Angela. I'm Miriam. Every day the NHS deals with 23 new obesity-related amputees. All need made-to-measure prosthetics and weeks of physio to be able to use them. Gosh, it is a monster, isn't it? It's surprisingly heavy. Can I hold it? Absolutely. Oh, shit a brick! Yeah, it is! Does it feel like a foreign body? Yeah, it does. And I don't ever envisage it being a natural feeling. But you're going to have to get used to it, aren't you? Yeah. If I want to walk, then... Oh, well, you do want to walk, don't you? Well, yeah. Ultimately... You do. ..you have to. I want you to walk, and I've only just met you! Ultimately, you have to get used to it. But it does, it does feel strange. Well, you'd better get on with it. Right, then. Let's get your hands on the chair. And then coming up. That's it. And as you're up, click your knee back so you can feel it lock. And holding on. OK. So really hitching that up. That's lovely. Good. You're managing really well there. That's great! Good. OK? You did it! Yes! That's it. I'm done now! How was that? Exhausting. Amputations are frighteningly more common now, aren't they? Yes. Type two diabetes is on the rise. And so obviously, one of the consequences of diabetes is amputation. And one of the consequences of obesity is diabetes? Yes. So it's a kind of horrible chain of circumstance. It absolutely is, yes. Do you blame yourself for this situation? Do I blame myself for being now fat and one legged? Yeah, probably. Because I could have done more. Angela is only 41. She's too young to have to see her life disappearing like this. Her nails are red and beautiful. She's someone who wants life, who is part of life, and it's being cut off. Her life is cut off, not just her leg. Angela's weight has cost her her leg and her freedom. Stuck all day in her living room, she relies on carers to wash, dress and feed her. Hello, it's only me. VOICEOVER: I was concerned. Come on in! Oh, that's good. The door opens. It's like magic! Hi. Hello. I apologise, I'm in my pyjamas. No, they're very fetching! Thank you. I brought you a couple of things. I'm going to put them in the freezer if that's all right. OK. Cock-a-leekie soup. You've brought me a spider as well! Oh, well, that was no extra charge! Oh, OK! And some cottage pie. I've put it in in the second drawer down. Oh, lovely. Thank you. That was really kind of you. OK. That's it. Well, I was going to show you my scar. Well, let's have a look at it. Well, it's healed up amazingly. It's beautiful. I mean, I don't know what I was expecting to see, but something that was kind of bleurgh, you know! Yeah. But it's not at all. No. What effect does it have up here? It's not great for mental health, because there is all that self-hate. At the moment, all there is is this... ..awful image in my head of my body. Despite her self-esteem having plummeted, Angela still dreams of being able to walk down the aisle with Ryan, her partner of eight years. We have known each other for 25 years and then, the wonders of social media, both of us had divorced. And, well, you messaged me on Facebook, didn't you? I certainly did. We went on one date and he hasn't gone home since. You didn't bargain for all of this, of course? No. I mean, what's it like? What's sex like? Do you have sex? Can you have sex? We do, just not very often. Sex is a massive issue, though, isn't it? Mm-hm. Is it the leg that's coming between you, so to speak? I think so. I probably could count on one hand how many times Ryan's seen me naked since my amputation. But he loves you. I certainly do. But I don't believe it, do I? No. Because? Who'd want to be with me? I've lost count how many times I've told her that I'm not going anywhere. I'm here to help. You're listening, aren't you? I notice you paint your nails. Yeah. What's that about? That's my kind of little treat. And also, when I've got them on, I don't feel like my fingers are quite so fat and sausage-like. So you really care about your appearance? I think I care more about other people's perception of me. I've never actually seen a stump before. It was like a tombstone for a leg. And it came from obesity. She lost her leg because she was too fat. That's a bit scary. Fat is expensive. It's costing the Health Service a fortune. Fat people are taking too big a slice of the budget. Now, that, we can't have. So somewhere, the cycle's got to be broken. The next generation is predicted to be the fattest ever. The government has decided to act. They've initiated a weight management scheme. All over the country, children are being measured, the overweight identified, and invited for retraining. Hi. Hello, good morning. How are you? Good, thanks. Emma? I'm Emma. Nice to meet you. So I'm not quite sure what goes on here. So we ring overweight children that are identified by the National Childhood Measurement Programme and they are identified... So who's measured them? So school nurses measure them. Is it a big problem? Yes. Yeah. Yeah, we see a lot of very overweight children. From what age do you take care of trying to...? So, five to 17. Kids can be obese at five? Yeah, they can be obese younger than that. But we take them from five. Hi, my name's Emma. I'm calling from the Live Lighter programme at the Weight Management Service. What we do is we run a 12 week programme. So we do a little bit at the beginning on, say, things like sugary drinks, portion sizes. And then in sort of the second part, we do some physical activity. You know, this is a very tough job you're doing, because you're ringing people who don't know you, and trying to get them to get their kid to join a club... Yes... that they don't want to join. Yes. Essentially, in a nutshell, that is what we're tying to do! It is difficult. And, you know, we have had some telephone calls where we've had some very, very angry parents. You know, they have said we cause anorexia and, you know, we haven't got the right to speak to them and all that kind of stuff. You can tell... You can tell... ..that they're resisting like billy-o. Yeah, definitely. And I do get it to a certain extent. I get it, because it's a cold call, it's something that they might feel quite conscious about themselves, because there's a load of judgment on parents, you know, if you've got a child who's overweight, well, it's your fault. And it's just not as simple as that at all. The blame game is a very common game in the fat world. Yes. Mm-hm. My mother, from whom I inherited fat, she was a feeder, she fed me so that she showed her love for me. All her culinary skill was focused on making me a fat, happy baby, a fat, happy adolescent, but a miserable fat grown-up. This is Claudia. She's just joined the programme. She's almost 11 and the only child of Helen and Mike. Oh! THEY LAUGH Family shot! I wanted to know if Claudia was experiencing everything that I'd gone through almost 70 years earlier. Hello! Hello! Mind the very... Oh, I love dogs... loud, barky dog. Come on! I'm always better with dogs than I am with children. Hello! I'm Miriam. Hi. So, when you look at me... ..what do you see? A kind person. Do you? Yes. I'm going to stand up so you can see me better. What do you see? Erm.... Tell the truth. It's hard, because, like, you're trying to... Someone's asking you what they look like. But you don't want to say something, because... Why not? You don't want to be mean! Don't be... I won't be offended. I know what it's like to be judged. And it's not a nice feeling. I know that I am overweight and I know I am a bit fat, but I'm not THAT fat. But I know that I'm at that risk, that I will be like that very soon, if I carry on what I'm doing. Now, tell me, what are you doing? I steal food. You steal food? Do you mean you steal from shops? No. From the house. From the house. I'm glad of that! Because I don't want to be interviewing you in a cell! So can I ask what it is you steal? Chocolate. Why do you think you do that? Probably out of boredom, is one of the worst things. But I'm try... I've stopped it now. Ish. Claudia, of course, reminds me of me. I'm not sure I was as articulate as she is, but, oh yes, there's a mirror there I'm holding up to nature! What's it been like for you, with that enchanting little person? She's hard work sometimes, she really is. But very engaging. Do you worry? Very much so. I don't want her to be fixated on her size, to be upset with herself about her size. I would much rather her focus on the health benefits of being slimmer. But also, she's going to secondary school in September and I worry that... she's started to get, not the bullying so much as name calling at the moment. I think it's just going to get worse and worse as she goes through school. Do you ever feel guilty about the situation? Not guilty. But responsible, yes. To an extent. And I think when she was a baby, we were a little bit obsessed on making sure she ate everything. And then we did use treats as rewards, didn't we? We have done, yeah. Did you know she steals? Yes. We found the evidence behind the sofa. Have you thought about simply not buying anything sugary? Well, I try not to eat it. It's just your habit. I've got a bad habit. Well, tough shit. You're going to have to stop! Thanks! Well, he does hide it in his golf bag! Yeah. Well, that's where she's getting it from. Yes. It's all my fault. Well, it's not ALL your fault, but I think you're implicated, let's say! Without a doubt! Every week for three months, Claudia and her parents join up with other families on the weight loss programme for two hours of exercise and education. Hello! OK, guys, so we've got the first question, we've got how much counts as one portion of fruit or vegetables? OK? Is it your own handful? Is it an adult's handfuls? Or is it as much as we can eat? I think I was expecting to see much fatter kids, real roly-poly infants. Adam? Your handful. It's your handful, yes. So if we're having things like that pear... Almost normal. We're just going to pop one bowl on each table and it's going to have a different food in it. The people who measure are very beady. They're not letting anybody get through. If you really don't like it, don't worry, we have got a bin, you can spit it out. I'll try this big one, if you try this tiny one of these. Go on, have a try of it. It's lovely. What do we think? Don't like it? Oh, I hate the one that's... You've got to try it. Ooh! Come on, try it. I can tell you now, that's my favourite, that one. Go on, in it goes. What do you reckon? Do you like the taste of sweet pepper? It's not that bad. It's not that bad! There, see? Did anybody try anything then that they've tried before and didn't like before? Yeah? Claudia's going to chase you all around this square. Go! I can absolutely understand that people might feel, you know, "Piss off, it's... it's not... it's not for you to say that my kid's overweight. Let me be the arbiter of that!" But the fact that they enjoy it so much shifted my view of it. Fat kids go on to be fat adults. So the sooner we can get hold of them and slim them down, the better. What was it like, had a good time? Yeah, I've gone red! Well, it suits you. The famous Jesuits said, "Give them to me before they're seven and they're mine for life." And I wish that somebody had done that for me. I would have been saved from a lifetime of people saying things and laughing at me and me feeling lousy. It would have made me a lot happier and a lot fitter, and I wouldn't have to walk with a stick and all that bollocks. Since I grew up, the world has changed beyond all recognition. Things like the all-you-can-eat buffet had not even been invented back then. But that still didn't stop me. I remember when I was at school, I was a little girl, and I had four helpings of chocolate semolina, and I couldn't finish it. And they made me sit and look at it all afternoon because I was greedy. Are you greedy now? Of course I am. Of course I'm greedy. Now, there's temptation on every street, and Britain has become the fattest country in Western Europe. The NHS's radical approach to curing some of the super-obese is surgically to stop them from overeating. I booked myself into an Airbnb near Manchester. Hello, duck. They probably said, "There's an overweight woman. "She might have some food." SHE CHUCKLES I'd come to meet someone currently undergoing the NHS's most controversial obesity cure. I found Jess on the internet because she posts pictures of herself and the story of her search for slim. I think she's very pretty, but she's got one hell of a big body, and that's what she wants to get rid of. Jess is 28. A year ago, she'd reached 23st. She's now begun trying to cut her body weight in half and is already down to 17st. After proving she could change her eating habits, the NHS decided Jess was eligible for bariatric surgery. Six weeks ago, Jess had her stomach reduced to the size of an egg, limiting the amount she can eat for evermore. I wanted to find out if bariatric surgery could save the obese, and the NHS. Very pleased to meet you. Nice to meet you. I'll come and sit next to you. Yes, of course. Well, I've been fat all my life. So have I. And clearly, you've decided you're not going to be fat at 78 like I am. How long is it going to take? I should be at goal weight... they say about a stone a month, so... God, that's fast! I've got a way before getting there, but I'm hoping I've only got about 7st more still to lose. I would be too scared to have an operation. Does it take courage to take that decision? Absolutely. It's a life-changing decision. And you think it's going to change for the better, obviously, because this is something you desperately want. Yeah, it's something that I've always wanted. The NHS already performs over 6,500 bariatric procedures a year. Jess's recovery is being overseen by Professor David Kerrigan. So, this is your first post-op visit. It is. After your operation. How's it been? Fantastic. At first, it was so painful, like, the trapped wind was horrendous. And then two weeks after the operation, I got my energy back and could start being normal, back to work and everything. Now I'm starting to see a difference here and everywhere else. Everyone's noticing, so that's fantastic. This kind of period of fairly rapid weight loss is going to go on for about six to nine months. Yes. It does definitely start to kind of plateau out and tail down, and there's a small number of people who do regain the weight, long-term. Is there? About 15%, 1-5. Why do they regain weight? Is it that their discipline drops? Yeah, I think it's because this actually isn't a cheat, it's hard work. And I think what you have to do to get a good long-term result is - you have to change. Following surgery, Jess can only eat minuscule amounts of solids. If she doesn't stick to her nutritionist's instructions, her stomach could stretch and she could regain weight. I think I'm ready to go onto the softer foods stage. Yeah. OK. Each bariatric operation costs the NHS between £5,000 and £8,000. There have been complaints that it's not a fair use of resources. People get very angry, and thin people think that they shouldn't be having surgery, they should jolly well get on with it and do it themselves. I think it's all very well if you're not in that situation to say, "Well, just get off your backside and exercise more and eat less." That's fine when you're somebody like me who maybe needs to shift a stone, but actually, once your body goes beyond a certain level of obesity, it's a point of no return. The NHS, at the moment, spends £1 million an hour, every single hour of every day, just treating diabetes. And these operations, we know, can get rid of diabetes in three quarters of patients within two or three years of having the surgery. So you don't need a Nobel Prize in Economics to work out that this is actually something that's very good for the health service in terms of saving it money in the long-term. Bye-bye. Bye-bye, Professor. I wasn't sure what to make of bariatric surgery. For Dr Kerrigan, it's an effective way to reduce the cost of obesity on the NHS. For Jess, it seemed much more about becoming who she wanted to be. Oh, this is posh. Do you have your ideal body image, let's say? I do know I've got a curvy figure, because my waist goes in quite a lot compared to my hips. So, you know, it's like I'd love to have the Beyonce-like curves. I'd love to have that kind of hourglass shape. It's a devil of a job getting out of your car! By the time I was in my 20s, I'd simply learned to cope with being fat. Things were clearly different now. I wanted to know why. Hello? Hello! Nice to meet you. Lovely to meet you. Jess was taking me to see her mother, Jill. When Jess cracked on doing this operation, she said you weren't thrilled at first. Not at first, cos, as a parent, obviously I was extremely worried. And how did she convince you? It's because it's what she's always wanted. And nobody else knows this cos, on the outside, Jessica is the most bubbliest, smiliest, positive... You should hear her to all her friends. All her friends are so tiny, you know, really, really tiny. And her friends would say, "Oh, I look fat in this." And Jessica's like, "Well, I'd change it to that," because she wants them to look their best, you know what I mean? But on the inside, Jessica's thinking, "I wish I was like that." You've obviously never had a weight problem, I'm imagining. No. Do you belong to a gym? No. I don't exercise at all. JILL LAUGHS Right! Sorry! So did people ever comment on, "Why is your daughter a big girl when you're not?" Jessica would say, "Something, something, something, Mum," and people would go, "Mum?!" That is hurtful, isn't it? Very. Throughout your journey of life, have you had lots of nasty comments? I was always so... aggressive in personality that people didn't dare, because I would have punched them or I would have said something horrible. But do you think also that society has changed a lot, you know? I think that young girls, particularly, think that they've got to look a certain way in order to be attractive and acceptable. Yeah. Now, that wasn't true when I was growing up. You could be whoever you wanted to be. Yeah. You know, I've just said, "Well, this is me and tough shit if you don't like it." Yeah. I wish I could have had that, or thought like that. But when you're young, it's hard. Jessica lives in a different era now, doesn't she? All her friends are extremely skinny, and they're striving for the Instagram bodies. And that's what Jessica was up against. I'll give you a hug. Thank you so much. It was lovely. Lovely to meet you. You've taught me a lot. Jess has a fixed picture of herself, slim. She believes that when she's this, she will be happy and she will have achieved her dream. But it's not an easy thing to do. I'm concerned for her mental peace of mind. She might be OK. The... The proof of the pudding. Bariatric surgery might be a short cut to healthy, but I was curious if it could be a short cut to happiness. Jess's friend Sammy had bariatric surgery nearly two years ago. I wanted to see if it had made her dreams come true. I'm not sure if that's the doorbell or not. Hello! Hello, I'm Miriam. Nice to meet you. And you're Sammy, aren't you? Yeah. Can I come in? Yeah, of course. Thank you. So you had the surgery two years ago. Yeah. And how much weight did it enable you to lose up to now, say? Eight and a half stone. May I ask how much you weighed before? I was 16st eight. So you lost half your body weight, really? Yeah. More than half. I've gained a stone back. What about the... missing the food? That's the hard bit. In the beginning, that was really, really hard because with having a gastric bypass, it's the only one that comes with a term called dumping syndrome. So when you eat something you shouldn't be eating, like, for example, sugar... It punishes you. It punishes you bad. My worst ever one was eating half an After Eight mint. I'd say about five minutes after eating it, my heart starts racing, like, thumping really fast as if I'd just done a marathon. I started sweating. I started with a horrible stomach-ache. And between where I sit at work and the toilets is not far at all, and I did not make it. It was like projectile vomit. Of half an After Eight. In a way, you've got to have some sort of willpower, otherwise you're going to learn the hard way like I did. But you still are glad that you took that step? Yeah. Health-wise, yes, but I have a lot of excess skin. It's like I've lost the weight, but the skin is still there. I've not got it as bad as a lot of other people because I wasn't absolutely huge, but with my legs, you can see the lines. Yeah, well, I wouldn't bother about that. But it's mainly my tummy. See, I've got all this. Gosh, you must have lost weight. Crikey. So when I have my tummy tuck, they'll pull it all in. So all this will be gone. So that's quite a bit of skin that's got to come off. Yeah, all this. There's a lot there to go. I imagine that you don't like that, you don't want that. No. Can you show me what's in the kitchen, what you've got in the fridge? Yes. I have, like, a bit of an addiction to food shopping. Christ! that is the fullest fridge I have ever seen. With bariatric surgery, you do eat very small amounts, but you eat so often. A pack of chicken, this would probably last me about four meals. And in the beginning, you have to follow what's called the 20-20-20 rule, which is where you take a 20p piece size of food, you've got to chew it 20 times. Swallow it. Wait 20 seconds before you can have your next piece, which is again, another 20p piece size of food. Blimey. I know. It is a pain and it's something that's hard to get used to. "Nothing... nothing tastes as good as skinny feels"! So your feelings about your body are...? It's a bit hard, really, because with my gastric bypass, unfortunately, one of the things I have gained is body dysmorphia. So some days I can get up and I'll see... ..I'll see a little person staring back at me. But most days, that's not what you see. You see somebody just the same size as what they were when they had the surgery looking back at you. It's something to do with the rapid weight loss that your brain hasn't caught up. Do you notice that people treat you differently now? Sometimes, yeah. Like, some people are quite rude about it. They're like, "Oh, so you just took the easy way out." Not everybody can be happy. You can't please the world. As long as you are. Are you happy? HESITANTLY: Yeah. Once I've sorted the skin out, maybe. And once I've got my head around it. Sammy just doesn't see how little she is. The brain doesn't catch up with the body. I had no idea that the brain was so slow, that it could reject what it sees. I was still puzzled. Before I left Sammy, I wanted to find out whether surgically shrinking her stomach meant she was living out her dream or her nightmare. Hello. Hi. I went for lunch with Sammy and her son, Alfie. How old are you, Alfie? Five. I'm 78. His face! His mouth dropped open! Can you show me some photos of what you were like when you were fat? Yeah, of course. This is one. God! It's quite scary to look at. Look at you! I know. Mummy was fat, wasn't she? Yeah. Thank you. Do you want the sausage? Mummy can't eat it. You can't eat it? Yes, please! I can't eat sausage. There's too much fat in it, it'll make me sick. So this will be what I can eat. I can't eat the bread. So this is kind of like what I don't... Will you eat all of that bit that's in the middle? No, that'd be far too much. She's got a lovely figure. But I know that I would go stark raving bonkers. What you're left with is this endlessly, mind-bogglingly boring job of having to slice little tiny bits of chicken, buh! And you never can have chocolate and you can never have pasta. It's not just paring down of food, it's paring down of life. And I didn't sign up for that. Have you finished? Yeah, I'm full. That was just a few tiny mouthfuls. It seems to me that all the fun has gone out of food. Yeah. So is it worth it? Yeah. No, I see what it's worth and I see the benefits. Are you mentally prepared to face another 40, 50 years? Yeah. I think I'll be fine. Pasta stupenda, grazie. Grazie. God bless. Thank you very much. Goodbye. Bye-bye. Bye! It seems to me that Sammy has achieved the Holy Grail of a thin body, but that's only the beginning of the journey. The pilgrimage to happiness is going to take a lot longer. I don't know if there's any liberation possible. We're trapped. I'm trapped in fat. And Sammy's trapped in thin. Bariatric surgery was not for me. But Sammy and Jess clearly believed that, to transform your life, you needed to transform your body. While they were working on it from the inside out, it seemed there might be a quicker way - go from the outside in with plastic surgery. What bits would you like to zap off? I'd like to zap off my belly, some of my arse... ..and a bit of tit. I think those are the areas that are holding me back, particularly the belly. I avoid looking at it when I get up in the morning. Last year in the UK, nearly 30,000 people had some form of cosmetic surgery. I wanted to discover how a private plastic surgeon could help the overweight transform their lives. I've come to see Mr MacQuillan. I'll introduce you to me. Oh, right! Hello! Pleased to meet you. I'm Miriam Margolyes. My name's Anthony. How are you doing? You caught me while I'm eating a biscuit, I'm very sorry. That's all right, I'm glad you eat biscuits. Biscuits are a bit of a problem for me. Everybody likes biscuits. Yeah. Or at least most people do. I've come to talk about your speciality, which is making people thinner. If I can help people, I try. Here is the magic door. To help work out surgical possibilities, Anthony has a special machine. Here we go. It enables a client to see themselves exactly as they are... So if you give me your dressing gown... ..to get a better idea of what they could become. Stand where you are for a second, arms out to the side. Doesn't have to be that much, but just down to about there. And it'll be a bright flash in about ten seconds' time. OK. That's it. That's it, is it? If you pop your dressing gown back on... Thank you. We've now just got to wait for the picture to process. And what it's doing is, it's putting the 96 individual images together to make one big, 3D picture of you. There we go. I look like a sumo wrestler! What this machine isn't good at doing is picking up hair. So it has a tendency to give you a complete haircut. We're quite lucky, actually, because it doesn't like black cloth either. There's a possibility that when we spin you round, you may have a hole in your bottom or something. You know what, I hope I have got a hole in my bottom! Yes, an additional hole in your bottom. Right, OK, so here we are. Now, what you've got to remember is it's not designed to be a filtered image. This is you as it is. This has done nothing for my self-confidence, I will tell you! I didn't realise my arms were so saggy under here, you know, this bit. What do you call these flappy bits here? People call them bingo wings. Bingo wings? I've never heard that. It's just excess skin in the upper arm. And I mean, these tits could do with a hoist. It's just uncomfortable to look at yourself and not like what you see. I can push and tuck and... Well, just make her half the size! Well, OK. For a start. So, liposuction, which will basically reduce the volume here. Oh, Christ! So let's go for half a litre, all right? That's all right, half a litre. That's a bit of lipo there. Now, we can go further, but that would be a very, very good result for you and you probably might need to combine it with a little bit of dieting. That is before weight training. That is after weight training. And a bit of Instagram. Are people perhaps too much concerned with what they look like? That's a very difficult question. Well, it is difficult for you because part of your work is involved in catering to people who aren't satisfied with their body image. And I'm asking you, you know, to cut your nose off, really, which I shouldn't. But I'm just wondering if you feel that it's gone too far, this thing. I think there's a big pressure these days on social media. I think people do see themselves differently than they did before and perhaps not always with a very realistic, you know, light on it. Also, the whole pressure in social media of being fed images like, "This is what Kim Kardashian looks like. "This is what you must look like," people are feeling pressure to sort of be driven towards some sort of perfection which actually, in real life, in nature, doesn't exist. And it's important to understand what the limits of what we can achieve are. I think it's damaging to try to foist on your body the image that you've gleaned from some other human being, and then actually want to carve your body up to match the image. Don't like that. Tackling obesity surgically was not a path I was prepared to travel. I wanted a more natural alternative. I'd found a man called Aeronn. His response to being overweight was to build himself a new body without surgery. Aeronn's a natural body-builder who's transformed his body through diet and exercise. I was hoping that he could show the way to the rest of us. How are you? Are you Aeronn? I am, yes. I'm Miriam. Very nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. You're not what I was expecting. Good! What did you expect? I thought I was going to see a big, sort of beefy sort of type. Mm. How tall are you? Not very - 5'2" on a very good day. I'm interested as to why you want to have a muscular body. Do you think being short has made you... Most certainly. ..conscious of this sort of thing? Yeah, I do. I didn't want people to look at me and think, "Oh, there's a short guy." I would have liked people to look at me and say, "There's a muscular guy." Were you ever fat? Very. Yes. Yes. When I was studying in university, and at other periods in my life, I have been really quite fat, yeah. I was fat 25 weeks ago. I lost 40lbs of body fat to do this competition. In the build-up to judgment, Aeronn sculpts his physique by dropping over 4st through a strictly controlled diet. So there's no fat with that, is there? According to the plan, yeah, there's less than a gram of fat. What's your fluid intake? Today I am drinking eight litres of water. Eight litres?! Yes. You must be pissing all day. Very much. Yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'll be back and to the toilet quite a lot. TOILET FLUSHES I'm fascinated by it because it's new to me, but I can't quite see the magic yet. Wow. Don't you think your, um, twingle is a bit loose? A little bit, yes. I think you need to... Sort that. I have another pair. We don't need anything popping out, no, no, no. No, of course not. Extraordinary. What do you want to improve on? For me, as part of always being slightly heavier, I actually have some loose skin on my lower abdomen. It doesn't shrink. Yeah. It doesn't. And you can see quite clearly, there's stretch marks on me. I think it's quite empowering for some people as well, because someone might see my physique and think it's quite impressive. But also, there are these little imperfections as well. And I kind of wear them as much as everything else. I can totally see that this is therapeutic for somebody with a body image problem. I mean, he's made himself attractive to himself. Many of the obese people I'd met seem to agree with Aeronn. If they could perfect their bodies, they'd end up happy. I was going to see Aeronn at his competition. If body perfection was the answer, I was going to what should be the happiest place on Earth - Newport, home to the Welsh Natural Bodybuilding Championships. If you see Dave, he'll get you weighed. If everyone's dream of defeating obesity comes to pass, this is what the future might look like - brown and beard-free. Hello! I like him without the beard, don't you? Yes. What is the thing that's being applied to you? It's a body-building stage tan, so it gives you this lovely glow. The gentleman who's applying... Yes. Do you know him? I've never met him before in my life. I saw him and I thought, "This chap looks like a guy that can apply some tan." And you've got your tight knickers on. Yes. That's good. Yes. Are you getting nervous? I feel excited. Are you? Yeah. Well, good luck. Can I come in? What are you doing? We call it pumping up. By pumping up, it makes us look bigger. So when we go on stage, we're already... Bursting. That's a good way of putting it. The judging was about to begin. APPLAUSE COMPERE: Front double bicep, front double bicep. APPLAUSE And give me your most muscular. This is really the ultimate scrutiny. You can't hide. It's "tan and go for it". I was in a place where everybody seemed to be approaching perfection. Quarter turn to your right. I was curious whether they were all happy. Why are you doing this? HE PANTS Body dysmorphia! I feel like I have to for my own... So that I feel good about myself. Makes you feel good about yourself? Yeah. These are the teenagers now. APPLAUSE Side chest, any side. Bless 'em! Bartholomew was 16 and had made himself into a teenage superhero. Come on, remember, these guys are teenagers! CHEERING But it wasn't enough to remove all his insecurities. Hello. Hello. I want to ask you something. Yeah. You said you suffered from body dysmorphia. I don't think it's something that's, like... What is that? ..proven. It's like you think you are small, so you keep going to the gym. But really, you're big. Some people call it bigorexia, cos you think you're small. So your view of yourself is not the view that I see, because you're an EXCEPTIONALLY handsome man. Thank you. So do you think of yourself as good looking? No. I'll look in the mirror and I still see things that I can improve. What sort of things? A classic teenager will want abs and big arms. Once you get those things, you start thinking, "OK, now I want a big chest. "Now I want big legs," and stuff like that. Why big? I think it's the idea of being that alpha male, the biggest guy in the room. Well, what a ravishing young man. I mean, he really is gorgeous. And he's 16 and he's worried about his arms. There's something wrong with a society where people worry about their arms. Somehow today, even people as perfect as Bartholemew have got themselves trapped, seemingly chasing an unobtainable dream. I'm trying to find out what people think about body image, and I wondered if men are able to deal with it. I don't think men deal with it as well as women. They don't? No. We've had it for years and years, and we've become accustomed to it. But I think with the onset of social media, Instagram, Facebook and things like that, there's more pressure for them to look absolutely flawless and perfect. So people try to achieve flawlessness, and it's not achievable. The judgment was coming to an end. The strange thing is it makes me feel a bit sad. I just feel that it's all about externals. I don't think externals matter, and they do. I'd like the body to be something that people didn't have to work on and so on. But it's very sweet, which I never thought body-building was going to be. Welsh overall champion 2019... ANNOUNCEMENT DROWNED BY APPLAUSE I was quite surprised at the person who won. Bless him, he cried. He was so emotional about winning, which is terribly touching, actually, but it's about obsession. The obsession to lose weight, I can understand. The obsession to look like these people did, I don't understand. It's an accentuation of the muscle before the mind, and I'm afraid for me, the mind has got to be paramount. And I will say that over and over again. Which is why I'm allowed to be fat, because my mind is not fat. I'd come to realise that, even if I grew 2ft taller and dropped 5st, my life wouldn't be automatically transformed. Perhaps I should stop blaming my mother for making me fat and re-evaluate. That's Mummy and Daddy. Daddy ate just as much as we did. But he didn't balloon. You know, this is the way the cookie crumbled, straight into my mouth. And I'm happy because a lot of things in my life have worked well for me. I am loved. I have a partner. My parents love me. My friends love me, and I love them. And I think that's what makes you happy. It's... relationships are the key. I think, you know, whether you've got a size 50 or a size 20 or a size eight... ..it's who you are that makes the difference. The people I met made me worried about our obsession with social media. It seems to have made it hard to be happy when everything is focused on your body image. It was Claudia, my mini me's 11th birthday. I decided to crash the party to tell her what I'd learned. Hello! Hello. Who's a year older? Not me! Here's your present. Thank you! And don't say anything about how badly it's wrapped, cos I'm not a wrapper! I'm really bad at wrapping, too. Do you know what it is? Is it a towel? It is. It's red, my favourite colour. Your favourite colour. Good, so that's basically a success. Who... who slept in here? We didn't sleep in there, this is the common room. Let me see if I can climb in. The point is, I might never get out. The most important thing in life is to be confident and to feel loved. My best friend and my best friend. And you don't care what anybody looks like, do you? No. You don't care that I'm fat, do you? No. No. Are you sure? It's what's inside that counts. It's what's inside. I think that's wonderful, because... Go on, get it in! Group hug! ..they care about you. Yes. Isn't that wonderful? Yes. You have inspired friendship. When I saw her in the common room with her mates... Sorry if I've got my arse in your face. ..and I knew she's confident and she feels loved. Oh! I made it! She knows who she is, and they know who she is. Who's that horrible goblin? It's a Mandrake. Oh, of course it is! Ha-ha! You should... LAUGHTER I should know that, shouldn't I? She's not worried when she's with them. She feels good. Oh! Aaah! That's what I wanted to see and what I hoped I'd see, and I did. There's no need to feel bad about yourself, ever, because, look, you've got lovely friends who really care about you, and don't take too much notice of... What did you call it? Snap, Snapchat? Snapchat, there's Twitter, Facebook, erm, Instagram and TikTok. They're just... ..chickenshit. Fern is deeply shocked. LAUGHTER Bye! I don't like children, usually, you know, they're not my favourite thing, but she's a little dear. It was now seven months since Jess had bariatric surgery to cut her stomach in half. I was acting in a play in London. I heard that Jess was in town and I want to have a chat with her. I wonder if you'll recognise her. I don't know. I've got a picture of her on my phone, and she's a pretty, pretty girl, but, erm, definitely on the large side. That's our Jess. That WAS our Jess, anyway, we'll see what she gives us this morning. I thought it would be quite nice if we went on the stage so she could have a really dramatic reveal. Bloody Ada! Hello! Darling girl! Hello. How are you? I'm really well, how are you? I'm going to give you a hug. Oh! That is fantastic. Come round here, and, I want to see a... ..the full body. JESS LAUGHS Yep, it's different! Isn't that amazing? It is, it really is. How much weight have you lost? In total, erm, I've lost 11st. I was 23st... You've lost half your body weight? I've lost half my body weight. I've lost a person and more, 11st. I'm interested to know what are the things that you can do now that you couldn't do when you were fat. Going out shopping. So this is amazing, because I've never been able to go to a normal clothes shop, and it's, like, wow, is this real? That's a lovely feeling, I bet. Yeah, yeah. And one of the main ones would be exercise. I've never, ever in my life, other than when I was 11 to 12 years old, been able to run. Going out, socialising with friends, to feel like I fit in, basically. What are you after? What's the end result? It changes all the time. Does it? It really, really does. So the goalposts are moving? Yeah, I mean, it's... I'm... I'm happy where I am now. Because what worries me is that maybe you keep moving the goalposts and you think, "I want my lips done, or my tits." I'm going to have them done. What are you going to have done? I'm going to have them enlarged. Why would you take weight off and then make them bigger? Because of how big they were. They was a double J, whereas now it's like they're hardly there any more. But they're lovely! Yeah, they're lovely in a bra. So you are continuing with operations, then? With my boobs and my... with my skin, yeah. So you've got your boobs, and your skin. Is it going to stop there? Yes, absolutely. Hmm. Thank you for sharing all this. Thank you very much, Miriam. You're a bobby-dazzler. Thank you. For Jess, it was absolutely right. She knew what she wanted, and she went out and got it. But is it for everybody? No. Is it for me? No. I've got to make do with this, this body that I've got, and I'm doing all right so far. When you're the age I am, you don't see total solutions. Partial solutions, and I'm happy with that. But this journey has changed me. It's been amazingly interesting to hear other people's stories, see their struggles, see their triumphs. Losing weight may be one answer, but the ideal thing is to look in the mirror and like who you are. It's not always easy, and everything in the world is pushing us to change, to look like that person. I don't think that's healthy. I want to be able to look in the mirror and like what I see, and I don't always, but I find that if I sit down, and just look at my face, about to here, and after that, leave it alone. Don't look down.
