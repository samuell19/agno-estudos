It was devised in order describe to Schea Cotton. COMMENTATOR: ...playoffs, high lob for Schea. Oh! MAN 1: Growing up, Schea Cotton was the ultimate ball player at our age bracket. MAN 2: When I first saw him I was like, "There's no way this dude" "is the same age as everybody else." MAN 3: Schea was the first superstar that I remember watching when I was young. COMMENTATOR: Schea's animated. Cotton's on the drive. Pounded with a big slam. MAN 4: Some of those dunks he had as a 14-year old. Because kids were dunking back then, but he was dunking. [AUDIENCE CHEERING] It was unfair. You know, I felt like, "Oh, that ain't fair. This ain't fair." By far, Schea Cotton is the best high-school athlete that I've ever, ever seen. COMMENTATOR: ...been on all Monarchs so far. High lob. If there was a high-school hall of fame, Schea Cotton would definitely be in it. COMMENTATOR: Cotton punctuates with his signature slam. All the kids that he was playing with was around. We were all trying to be as big as Schea Cotton. MAN 5: Schea Cotton was like LeBron James before there ever was a LeBron James. Google Schea Cotton, you'll see. NARRATOR: For a true competitor, unrealistic expectations do not exist. Being great simply means being the best, with no litmus test or comparative scale by which to judge your accomplishments. It's sailing a sea of uncharted waters, defying the odds, cementing your legend, writing your story. Where that story ends is not always the choice of the author. Where that story begins isn't, either. He was very daring, and he was fearless, and he kept me busy non-stop. Schea was so active as a child, but he was so competitive, too. NARRATOR: Vernon Scheavalie Cotton was raised in San Pedro in the Los Angeles harbor area. The youngest son of Big James and Gaynelle Cotton, Schea's birth marked a transitional chapter in the Cotton family's story, and one that would ultimately shape them for years to come. First thing, we placed James and Schea into baseball. JAMES: Tee-ball at Peck Park. Our parents put us in sports to keep us active, you know, out of trouble. SCHEA: Started playing, um, I think around nine, ten years old, and I had a talent. I was really good at it. I enjoyed it. I was a right-fielder, had an arm. A little wild, so they put me in the outfield. Then it was time for them to go to the next level where it was live pitch, and live pitch, I was afraid the ball was going to hit 'em. So, that's how we got introduced to basketball. - ANNOUNCER: Schea Cotton. - BOY: Schea Cotton! NARRATOR: A natural athlete, young Schea picked up basketball quickly, developing a hunger for the game that transcended his adolescent attention span. Yeah, it went good. He picked up basketball, and it burned him out, see? We needed something to... with all of that energy, to tame him down, so to speak. So, basketball, running up and down the court was really good because by the time practice was over, he was ready to go to sleep. LAWSON: I used to love when it was time to go to my cousin's house and, you know, just playing there, and you knew, like, where you're on, this ain't... play, like, these dudes is for real. He got the shorts on. I got on this shit, the things Mom threw on me. You know what I mean? They come out, they had the shorts on, they're making all the baskets. Sports to my mother and father was really important, to get me and my brother involved, 'cause they wanted to keep us out of the streets. At that time, growing up in the late '80s, early '90s, there was a lot of family members and friends that were very entrenched in the city life and the street life, whether it's gang-banging, dope dealing, and whatever methods of making fast money. NARRATOR: Schea's obsession became a relief for Big James and Gaynelle, who were determined that the only statistics that their two sons would ever be associated with would be the ones found in the local sports page, not the obituaries. By the time I was eleven, I started playing with Slam-N-Jam with Issy Washington, which is what the guys in the LA area were playing. And I got a chance to see some of the better talented kids in my age group. GAYNELL: We played with Issy, and then, from there, we went to, uh, Pat Barrett. He had a team that was... ...called PTI, Performance Training Institute. Pat Barrett was the coach. Schea wasn't initially on their team. Schea had, like, 50 points against them. When I first saw Schea play, it was playing for Slam-N-Jam, Issy Washington in a local league out here, and I thought he was a couple of years older than they said. And then we found out that he was the right age. The first thing we had to do was get him to play with us. [CHEERING] NARRATOR: It would be the first time in Schea Cotton's life that he would be recruited for his talent. It would certainly not be the last. So he talked us in. "Well, you're gonna get the best coaching, you're gonna get the best training", and everything. Because he had wanted the better trainers in the country working with him. Des Flood from the shooting course, We had him over here in junior high school, a college coach teaching us shooting. AD Firiquido was still around. I loved him to death. He coached at Carson High School. He put us through footwork drills. Early on, Marv Marinovich, he put us through so much tests and things we would do so early, people thought we were way older 'cause of the way we started developing. Working out with Marv Marinovich was cutting-edge. He had a lot of Eastern European, uh, methods of training. He was like a weird scientist or something like that. You know, you're coming into the lab and you're gonna conjure up some kind of recipe for the day, something new. I analyze the body, find the weak links, and then fix them chronologically. My system actually enhances the athlete's play. All right. Good. Now, quickly, fire it up. All the way down. There you go. I just wanted to be the best that I could, so, when I would train with Marv, I just soaked everything up, and I did exactly what he told me. People told him what to eat, told him when to work out, what as good for him, what wasn't at such a young age, and combine that with his natural ability, you created a phenomenon, especially a guy who loved basketball as he did. Something that people were just in awe to see. He had it all. He had the strength and conditioning coach, he was lifting weights. The dude was like, you know, he was a physical specimen in the sixth, seventh grade. At night time, we would do donkey calf raises. People say, "How do you start jumping and all this?" The secret was, he'd get on my back, and I'd do, like, a hundred calf raises, and I'd hop on his back, and he had to lift my weight. He'd do a hundred calf raises. And what happens is, your calves become so strong, you just start flying. NARRATOR: Already six-foot and just twelve years old, Schea Cotton's physical gifts became the stuff of legend throughout Los Angeles schools and gymnasiums. Tales of a basketball Frankenstein spread like wildfire. JASON COLLINS: You hear stories about, "Man, there's this kid, his parents have him doing, like, you know, like, 500 push-ups, and, you know, a thousand sit-ups. You're gonna be like, "There's no way that kid is 12 years old." JARRON: And this is at 12 years old. JASON: This is at 12 years old, and you're like, "Man, who brought the high school kid" "to the 12-year-old basketball game?" DAVIS: When I first saw him, I was like, "There's no way that this dude" "is the same age as everybody else." I said the same thing that every other parent says. I was like, "There's no way that this kid is", "you know, the same age as me." "I know damn well. Look how small I am." He was just so much bigger, and he just had game. He had a game, like, a pro game, at an early age. I remember going to a Slam-N-Jam game when he played for Slam-N-Jam and watching him. He'd go from this happy-go-lucky kid... Like, that's what I knew. I didn't know it'd get serious at jump ball. And if you were to assemble a dream team, a dream team of the best 14 and under players in the country, perhaps at the top of the list would be a kid by the name of Schea Cotton. He is a 6'4", 14-year-old seventh grader out of Los Angeles. This is Schea in action last night. This kid is like a man among boys. I just think to myself, "If these kids only knew" "what these games were like when he played." When he was here, everyone would leave whatever game they were watching, whatever basket they were watching, they'd see Schea Cotton on the floor and they'd flock around his court. He had that ability to make you step your game up when the college coaches came, I got a chance to see John Thompson, Jim Boeheim, Lute Olson. Coaches all over the country were drooling and so forth. You know, "We need to get Schea Cotton." So, at that point, everything got crazy. So we tried to keep his head small and not let it get blown out of proportion. GAYNELL: He achieved a lot of success at 12 years old. The good thing, he kept his head on the ground because of Big James and me. Well, I look at it like, it's not one-man team, you know, it's five people manning the court. Have to play as a team. We just benefited off him. He was basically a traveling rock star with a rock band. When Schea was playing, it was more word of mouth. "Have you seen this kid?" "I heard this kid at 13-under nationals was..." "This kid has the chance to be a NBA." I mean, that's what people would say. I mean, people in the NBA were hearing about this kid. And so, when he played, it was packed, because the only way you could watch the kid was coming to the gyms. It was probably one of the first plays that I knew he was really the real deal. It was in a summer league game. He up screened this kid, caught the ball, did a reverse pivot, jab stepped and went to the middle, took one dribble, went off of one leg and tomahawked it. The funnest thing was going to Vegas for tournaments and stuff. And, um, the gyms would be packed. I mean, 4,000-seat high school gym, just packed. COMMENTATOR: Gym filled up for the defending national champions. PTI out of Los Angeles, and eighth-grade to be, Schea Cotton. This one, folks, wouldn't count offensive goaltending, but he would draw some "ooh" s from the crowd shooting from three-point range, and can the kid play defense? Look at him read the "D" here and make the rejection. And then, look at the no-look pass here. The bucket's missed, but Cotton's there for the follow-up, and of course, what's a Schea Cotton highlight without the alley-oop slam dunk? 27 points on the night. PTI remains undefeated with a 96-42 victory over San Antonio. From an early age, I think it was more so just the explosive athletic prowess he had. And I think it created an aura of excitement that we have not seen for a long time. Growing up, Schea Cotton was the ultimate ball player at our age bracket. You know, 12, 13, 14 years old. It's like, I wanted to check birth certificates 'cause he had the strength of an 18, 19-year-old, he had the athleticism, he had jab steps. He was left-handed, he could shoot to three. And he was the ultimate baller at that age. CHENOWITH: When I was a kid, playing with Schea, just the mention of the word "Schea Cotton," it was like a mystical figure. He was so much better, so much dominant than anybody else. It wasn't even really fair. PAUL PIERCE: Probably have to go back as far as sixth grade. That is my earliest memory of Schea Cotton. I just remember him being a phenomenal athlete, a fifth-grader who can dunk. He was sort of like my motivation. It just pushed me, and ultimately, he became my rival. He was pretty much, at that time for me, the only pro I had seen. CHRIS RIVERS: If there was social media covering Schea Cotton, I think it could have broke the internet at one point. Some of the things he did, some of those dunks he had as a 14-year old. Because kids were dunking back then, but he was dunking. I would always play a division up when I was coming up. I was always the best player in my division, and so I'd play a division or two up. Schea would actually play, like, four divisions up. I think my brother played a huge part in my development. I'd play against him, and he was bigger and stronger, so he would manhandle me early on, and then I would grow, get better and keep working. And then we would even out the one-on-one match-ups. That's when we couldn't play no more. Because it got to be, "I'm not gonna lose to you". Falling and hitting, and it turned to fights. SCHEA: And my mother wasn't really with that. So she was like, "If ya'll can't play without fighting", "then you're not gonna play at all." So it just started to become like, "Okay, we're gonna train together," "and we'll beat up on everybody else." NARRATOR: While Schea Cotton's parents worked hard to keep him from growing up too fast on the streets of Los Angeles, their son's talent made him grow up just as fast on the city's basketball courts. He spent day and night developing a focus far beyond his years. There was no doubt in Schea's mind that the hard work would pay off. It had to. Like I said, we were chewing bubble gum, eating... and Burger King and all that before the game. This guy was stretching and doing all this stuff to put on a show for these adults that was coming to see him play. So his childhood was quickly compromised. From 12 years old on up, um, I was living in a fish bowl. I didn't have any personal life anymore, or private life of my own. So we practice all day at school, we come home, we eat, and we'd be at the gym again. Friday night, we go and shoot, or do the stair climb or do weights, something, and just keep working. We always would say, like, while our friends were all partying at Friday night parties, we were in the YMCA working out, getting better. [WHISTLES] First guy up. Everybody else on the base line. Right now, what's gonna happen is, this drill here is for agility, lateral quickness. So we're gonna start at defensive stance. Get ready. Go. And when we get here, it's like hot coals. How quick do I need to touch and be out? Okay? Quickly. Don't stand there too long. And do not touch the octagon. All right, ready? JAMES: We went from having LA Gear, the sponsor to I think Reebok, Converse, and then, Nike. When Nike came, it was over. So eighth grade, they had a Nike contract. As an AAU team, they only lost two games in two years. They won over 200 games. MAN: Nike was very excited. They were happy. They had the next Michel Jordan on their hands, they felt. And he was the next great one that they wanted to back and make a shoe for, and get him in NBA, and take care of, so to speak. DAMANI NKOSHI: First time I saw Schea play was in Inglewood High. He walked in the door, sweatsuit on. Nike sweatsuit, everything tucked in, perfect. With the shoes, the mess, every little stripe with... I don't even know. I ain't trying to be on him or nothing like that, I ain't tripping. But it was a little bit... We're just coming in with maybe a hoodie, you know, whatever. So he just looked all the way, you know, just kept that way, like he was ready to go. I was basically a poster child. I mean, I wore every sneaker that they made from all the top ball players and the top athletes that they had, from Andre Agassi to Michael Jordan. I wore a brand-new pair of sneakers every game. He'd sit off to the side, gets ready to play. So he got a spank brand-new pair of, you know, Nikes. He's taken off the other brand-new Nikes to put on his game Nikes. So I'm like, "Okay, hold on, this is just..." We were in high school, so not only did we play in the shoes that we played in over the weekend, but the ones we walked in were the ones we played in. Schea had every sweatsuit that came out. Every pair of Jordans, every shoe, every sock, every... All the gear. Schea had everything. I think he had a direct line to Nike, and if he wanted some shoe, he'd call, they'd ship it. Fast forward, we get on the court. And they said, "You're not jumping ball." "You got the off-guard." So, I'm like, "Okay, this is... All right." So I'm just peeping all this out. Maybe the first or second play of the game, he'd do this little move, top of the key. My homeboy... I forgot who was on him, but he dug in, got low... It looked good. The way he dug in, but he just hit him with the cross. It went through the hole. All I saw, it was a swoosh under the shoe. I've seen this... Yeah, so. I mean, I ain't got no shame. That was a long time ago, so I can say that now. I wouldn't have told that story ten years ago. Now it's cool, like, "All right, I seen the swoosh." Joining me now is Gaynell Cotton, the mother of this phenom if you will. What's it like to be the mother of a kid that seems to attract attention wherever he goes? Well, he's just an average kid. We don't treat him any differently at home, you know? He still has chores and everything to do, but, um, it's great. We really enjoy him. Schea's a joy to be around and it's a joy to be on this team. I'm sure. It starts with the family. I know you probably have a lot to do with his success. You can't help but think to the future of high school and college, and, perhaps, the NBA. What would that dream mean to you, Schea and your family, if he could make it in the show, so to speak, by the year 2000? Well, right nowwe're looking at college tuitionbeing paid for, and anything beyond that is a blessing. He's looking forward to NBA first round draft pick. I hope his dream comes true. NARRATOR: As his prep school legend loomed as large as his physical stature, Schea took the Cotton family work ethic with him to the high school court. SCHEA: Mater Dei is a perennial powerhouse, so... I mean, they're inUSA Today top 25 every year, you know, the stakes are highand if you're not strong enough, you'll feel the pressure and it'll get to you. But for me it was right on time. You know, around that time I was just out of high school. So I remember hearing the name and people talking about this kid in high school that was just ill with, you know, with hoop. To be honest with you, before Schea Cotton came to Mater Dei, I didn't really know who he was. There was a little buzz about this guy coming out of St. John Bosco, transferring in. The first day of practice, you could see by his size, he was actually, you know, bigger than the guys we had. They were running drills. I'll never forget it, the first time down Miles Simon at the time takes it down, dribbles down on Schea. He goes up for a layup, Schea swats it right into the stands. Schea comes down one-on-one on Miles and dunks on him. NARRATOR: The Mater Dei Men's Basketball program has gone on to become one of the elite basketball programs in the country. Mater Dei Head Coach Gary McKnight would also go on to become the winningest high school basketball coach in California state history with over a thousand wins to his credit. It seemed to be the perfect fit for the rising star. GARY: He was a very special player. One time we were playing in the state tournament and we were running our zone offence, and Schea played short corner at times. And we threw him the ball and he did a dunk, where he literally sprung straight up, no dribble, and his head was even with the rim. He just threw it through. And on film, we're watching it, and notice the two guys on the end of the bench of Westchester, both got up and gave each other high-fives. In my fortunate years of 33 years here, athletically, there was nobody better than Schea. Shared a lot of those dunks for him, showed him how to do those things. When I had Clay show 'em the three and I got the nerf basket out and I showed him on the door how to do those things. COMMENTATOR: Schea's animated today. Cotton on the drive. Plowed it with a big slam! At least ten boards for Shawn today. - Cotton with a great pass. - COMMENTATOR 2: Great catch. RANDY: My fondest memory of Schea playing on the basketball court was... "You know, I was guarding him, "and I was always taught with a right hander, "to take his right hand away and make him dribble left. "Well, I didn't pay no attention to Schea being left, "so, I played, you know," "I took his right away and made him go left." Well, there was a guy by the name of Rashamel Jones that played for the University of Connecticut, UConn. He was on my team at Nike, and Schea blew by me, and I said, "Help!" So Rashamel Jones comes over to help me. It was bad defense, it was just bad, but Schea alleviated and dunked on Rashamel Jones, and I was like, "Oh, man, that's my man." I mean, he flushed on it pretty good. Schea was like... Like Charles Barkley but with, like, guard sense, you know what I'm saying? Like early Charles Barkley, when he was just a bully. He boosts everybody's level. You seen Schea, you're like, "There is no way that I'm going to the NBA." That's from me, probably Lamar, Elton, Baron, everyone else who was in his class. How can you make it to the NBA when the slot is already taken up? You knew Schea was going. COMMENTATOR: Cotton inside for the baseline slam! Unbelievable. [ALL APPLAUDING] - Everybody good? - Yeah! Schea came to the big game. He'd show up and show out. He'd drop a 40. Uh, I remember... the Las Vegas Tournament, when our team had, uh, our older team, I was playing on the younger team at the time. [LAUGHS] Baron, he was watching. He was watching your big bro. Let him know, you played the game before. [LAUGHING] Everybody was telling me, "Oh, Schea's flying into Vegas, Schea's flying into Vegas." This fool flew in to Vegas. Got a call on the phone, my AAU coach. This is high school now. I'm in summer school. "I need you." My services were needed, flight, plane ticket... And they had their team together with a lot of the top players and I just remembered he didn't play in most of the tournament, he just flew in for the championship game, and I just remember him having, like, 30 at the half. The hype of the game was Kevin Garnett and Schea Cotton. And, man, them two dudes was going at it, but it was just one play where Cotton was on the wing, and he pump fakes a guy, went baseline, and he went like he was going to dunk it on this side, and just came all the way up under the other side. He first dunked on Garnett, and just, like, shook the rim and just swung off. It was one of those games where Schea just, he told me, you know, "Just give me the ball." You know, just give me the ball. I never even knew he could shoot a three-pointer. I was coming up court, he was coming out the pick. Gave him the ball, he hit, like, six or seven threes in a row. I believe it was seven. Schea went baseline, man, and that was it. Once he go baseline, and you don't cut that baseline off, you better be prepared for flight school. Mr. Garnett proceeded to try to contest one of my baskets going to the rim, and I dunked on him, not once, not twice, but three times in the game. Different plays, I can remember one. I came on this side, made a move, left wing came down the lane... And turned around underneath the basket and KG went up, thought he was gonna block the shot. And Schea just... Oh! If anybody could've had that picture, it would be worth money today. SCHEA: Kevin's in the middle, the rim's here. He thought he was gonna block it. I showed it to him, put it on my numbers. Finished 180. In traffic, with friction, the crowd erupted. Everybody in the front was on the court. And me and Baron Davis, we were sitting right next to each other, and the whole time we're just nudging each other just like this game is crazy, it was sick, man. It was sick. And at that point after about six years, that was the first time that I ever beat him in a championship game as a youth, uh... And I started playing against him in sixth grade and got my first win against him in 11th grade. Oh, man, we live and direct, man, doing this photoshoot with Slam Magazine, shouts out to Slam. SCOOP JACKSON: We started Slam Magazine in 1994. And I came in in issue three. The first assignment... The first assignment I got was to cover Nike basketball camp. In Chicago, at Nike camp, went to Chicago Bulls training center, and was again, Kevin Garnett, but this time they had him with Ron Mercer. Same dunk. [CHUCKLES] MOSS: You know, it was the championship game of Nike, so Nike had their whole team, California had their own team. It was 12 teams. The number one seeded team was, like, the team. You know, it had Garnett, Ron Mercer, you know, it had all the top guys in the country on the number one seeded team. So, they met up, one and 12 met up. You know, all the hype. I was like, "Ooh, I gotta see this." You know, so, uh... They played, and when I tell you and you know, I'm not exaggerating, I'm not trying to blow smoke, but Schea Cotton embarrassed every guy on that team. SCOOP: The one cat that stood out of everybody on that Cal squad was Schea Cotton. So I'm writing this story, and all I'm doing is talking about this cat, Schea Cotton. And I'm like, in my mind I'm like, "I'm putting this dude on the map." Nobody knows about this dude. I don't give a fuck what anybody says. I discovered his ass. I'm not blowing him up but I'm letting everybody know that even when it came time for the dunk contest, Vince Carter didn't get any because Schea won the dunk contest in the lay-up line. Schea was doing dunks that they were like... Vince was like, "I'm not even getting in the dunk contest "'cause of what this kid here is doing in the lay-up drill." When I finally seen him play, it was against Kobe Bryant at the first NBA Top 100 Camp in Princeton, New Jersey. That was the place to be. They went at it. I'm talking about Schea was coming, power, dunking, mid-range, left-handed, going hard. Kobe was coming more of a jump shooter at the time. It was a war. That day Schea got the best of Kobe. It was close, but I'm gonna give Schea the nod. And I'm from Philly but I'm keeping it 100. He was such an imposing player. I mean, he was so massive, he was so LeBron-esque, Jordan-esque. I mean, his body was... How can this kid just be a kid? Well, he had... The term "Man-child" was devised in order to describe Schea Cotton. When he had just finished his freshman year in high school he was probably 6'5", 220-225, and just a powerful athlete. They used to interview me. Who's my favorite player? I would say, "My brother." 'Cause the things he did at a young age, I never seen anybody do. And I played against Michael Jordan, my first game out the shoot, guarded him and everything. Just as big as they made him, he lived up to it. Every game, where it was sold out, he played against another top big player in the country and there's coaches and everybody sitting on the floor. He gonna show up, he gonna come in there and dunk on ten people. He gonna take off from the free throw line near the end of the game, he gonna do all the stuff you expect him to do. And that's the difference between Schea Cotton and a lot of the stars now. He had the total package and he showed up every night, he never let you down. DAIN ERVIN: Back when Schea came up, and the people that spoke on Schea were legitimate real people. This wasn't no facade, this wasn't no fake, this wasn't no act. I always say, along with LeBron James currently, there are very few athletes in any sport that actually lived up to the hype that was them. And Schea would be one of those guys. COMMENTATOR: Cotton gets up in the air. Just a freshman, Marcus, all the confidence in the world. NARRATOR: In a world before social media hashtags and viral videos, the buzz surrounding Schea Cotton meant that his already broad shoulders would have to get that much broader. Schea Cotton was like LeBron before LeBron. Schea Cotton, Felipe Lopez, LeBron James coming out of high school, you put them all in the same category. Felipe probably should've left out of high school, Schea probably should've left after his sophomore year and went to the NBA. STEPHEN: He had the body of a LeBron, he was left-handed, with the athleticism of Jordan and Harold Miner. With the attitude of Metta World Peace and Steve Jackson. So, you add all that into one and imagine what kind of animal that is. To me, he was LeBron before LeBron. I mean, he did things that, you know, when you think of, quite honestly, LeBron James. Probably before LeBron James people thought of Schea Cotton. STEPHEN: Schea was a dog. Schea seemed like he ate gunpowder before games. Like we always say if LeBron had that... If there was a high school hall of fame, Schea Cotton would definitely be in it. You could make a good argument for that. He would be in the early high school hall of fame, the kids who were the best players ever as freshmen or sophomores. If there was a high school hall of fame, Schea Cotton would be first ballot. I don't if Schea would be, you know, first ballot, first, you know, the inaugural piece to get in, I don't know about that. He would definitely be in the high school hall of fame. First ballot in my book. But I do say if we did create a basketball hall of fame, which is still something that can be done, just in theory, you know, he would, without question, be in it. If you see Halle Berry, would you wanna have sex with her? It's a no-brainer. It's a no-brainer. If not, he should be first team, MVP all high school hall of fame. Because there would never be anybody bigger than him in high school basketball. And I say that by knowing it. You know, from being older than LeBron to seeing LeBron and being able to witness the Schea Cotton era, it's not even close. It's not even close. He would definitely by first team hall of fame. From 12 to pretty much 17-years-old, being one of the most famous basketball players in the state of California. When Sports Illustrated came in, it was like wow. I mean, all the cameras, the lights. I mean, they had different cameras I'd never seen before, you know. Big money comes to the table, you know it. At that time, I think there was no-one else that'd had something like that as a young ninth-grader. You know, this was when the rating star really coming out for high school players. There was a kid named Estaban Weaver, too, out of Ohio. And I remember when Schea first played Estaban that summer and he, like, destroyed him, and Estaban was supposed to have been the greatest thing ever. This is the first time he really started seeing, playing kids from different states, and they get the hype from back east. He killed him. I was sitting in Hawaii, uh, relaxing in Maui, and I got a Sports Illustrated and there's Schea. And there's like four pages on Schea. Pretty proud to be sitting there and being able to read about one of my own players. Siwas like the national bar, so to speak. You knew if you got there, you arrived. There wasn't that instant access to high school players. So, a guy being in Sports Illustrated, I mean, a national magazine that was about as big as it gets. But if you open up aSports Illustrated, and you see the dude from right down the street in here in Los Angeles, dunking on somebody and then talking about the path that he's on, There was no ESPN the magazine back then. Sports Illustratedwas it. Yeah. So it was actually very impressive. Sports Illustrated, I like that magazine. The only thing I dislike about it is what happens with the exposure. And because of the exposure at that time in our life, in Schea's life he was too young. The Sports Illustratedthing, I think, to be honest, was a negative, was bad because then it was like, where do you go from there? You know, there's so many times guys get over-exposed, you know, they say, okay, he can run, he can shoot, he can pass, he can dribble. And then, what else do you need to prove? So, I think once that point, you hit the pinnacle and then people just started picking at him and finding what's negative about him. After that, that changed his entire life. And us, too. NARRATOR: For the first time in Schea's life his legend loomed larger than his size. Despite the pressure, Schea was unmoved, channeling his focus on the court even further, blocking out everything in life that didn't fit between the baselines. Once he got between the lines on the court, that was his domain right there. Whether he was 6'6 " or 5'11" you just didn't wanna get into a physical, you know, match with him. I mean, everyone was scared of him. MAN: Guards were too small, seven-footers were too weak. He'd do whatever he wanted on the court. He was a man against boys. Actually, he was... [CHUCKLES] He wasn't even a man. He was an immortal against humans. He was almost... I mean, you know, it might sound like a lot but he was almost God-like for him to be that young and that good. NARRATOR: No matter the size of the stage, Cotton seemed to rise above it. MIKE WOLF: Nogales Mater Dei was a night game, and Schea I think had 20 points in the first quarter, uh, and for the play that you just never forget was, um, he caught an offensive board in traffic right under the hoop. Stood, kind of paused for a moment, which as a coach you sort of watch and wonder what's he gonna do next? They had a guy who was seven feet tall. And he was standing right there in the middle of the paint with about three or four other guys. And off two feet with, you know, not a whole lot of effort, it looked like, Schea jumps up with two hands and smashes the ball on everybody, off Verton. The whole crowd just sort of stopped, like... "What did we just see?" IAN POWERS: First time I heard about Schea was in... '94, I believe, it was. I was going to my junior year of high school. Long story short, my sister and I are 11 years apart. We have different fathers. Well, her father's son played with Schea at Mater Dei. A guy named Kevin Augustine. COMMENTATOR: Kevin Augustine into the game, high lob for Cotton for the slam dunk! Schea Cotton off the beautiful pass. My brother-in-law went over to go check him out. He actually called me on the phone, he said, "Man, I just saw this dude named Schea Cotton. You ever heard of him?" I said, "Yeah, I've heard of him." He said, "Man, what you doing to work on your game?" 'Cause this dude is the truth, basically is what he was telling me. His sophomore year, Mater Dei versus Fremont High School. It was my first time that I finally see Schea Cotton. I've been hearing a lot about him. Right there, you know, it seemed like he was going to be a legend in the making. POWERS: He, uh, in the state championship game uh, Fremont started out in the zone. And Coach McKnight had Schea running the baseline of the zone. He scored the first nine points of the game. He had three threes... to start the game off. When he came down on a break, on the left side of the floor, and crossed the guy over from left to right, got to the middle lane, and finger-rolled with his left hand, and got an And1. That pretty much set the tone for the rest of the night. NARRATOR: No longer a myth, Cotton had become the man. With the ball in his hands, and the world at his feet, he seemed to be standing on stable ground. That would quickly change. GAYNELL: Uh, the earthquake. We had an earthquake here in Northridge. And we worked for ourselves. We were able to move all these places because we worked for ourselves. And so, had not, we wouldn't have been able to do it. And we rented. So wasn't like we had to sell something, right? So, we couldn't get any of the work because we didn't work in LA County. So we had to move to LA County. We thought about post office boxbut that wasn't gonna work. So we physically had to move to LA County because at that time you work with a lottery. And so, your number go in the hat, and when your number come around, then you get work. So we needed to work. So we moved back and he went to Bosco. SCHEA: For my junior year, transferred to St. John Bosco High School where I started. It was a real good transition. Um, got back in the LA area. Just... It was a new Schea. So I was refreshed, rejuvenated, new team, new system. Wanted to just go in and really play well and make a name for ourselves and put the school on the map as far as nationally. Which I did. We were ranked the USA Today Top 25. NARRATOR: Feeling like he had more to prove, Schea elevated his focus on the court once again. MAN: We in Los Angeles, man. People do not understand. They see all the glitz, the glamor, the Magic Johnson style. But this is where it all starts. Right here on the block. - Yeah. - Break it down, man. Most definitely. I mean, most of your playground players, and your NBA players come out to the playgrounds, you know. You got to start somewhere like me. I started playing on the playground with the big boys, you know. You learn to take a beating here and you gonna think back on the program, you know what I'm saying? - That's the way it's supposed to be. - Right there. MAN: What's your next move once you get through to high school? My next move is to just, uh... I'm trying to take care of my entrance exam, the SAT, and just go from there. I mean, whatever happens happens. I can't really call it right now'cause it's tight. But my main goal is to get as good as I can while I can. You know what I'm saying? Because you only have the opportunity one time. Well, the summer of my junior year, played in the Long Beach NIT. National Invitational Tournamentlssy Washington used to run. So it was like a big time game. And I played well. I believe I had, like, 38 points at the end of the third quarter. We had another quarter to go. I was on my way to 60. You know, 60-point game for sure. I felt really good. I felt like they had no answer for me. It was at the Gold Mine, Long Beach State. The old gym. Hot box. And he went up for a rebound. He was doing good. He was playing against Lamar Odom's team and Shabaz and Khalid El Amin. And me and Karim and Shabaz got tangled up on a rebound. I tried to grab the ball out of his hand with one arm. And uh... Somehow my arm got intertwined with his and I pulled back with the basketball and he pulled forward. My shoulder snapped like a drumstick. I dislocated... My shoulder had to have reconstruction. Had a labral tear. And that changed the course of my career, from that point. NARRATOR: For the first time, the immortal man-child was suddenly mortal. Not only would he sit out injured for his senior year of high school, the allegations came, adding insult to injury. GAYNELL: They knew that we didn't do anything wrong with his car and the tires. They send you through all of this enormity for what? We worked for ourselves. So we were able to support our family and buy things for our kids because we worked for ourselves. And they started investigating everything about this. The car, which is ridiculous. The car he was driving, uh, was a hand-me-down from me. The stereo from my old car went into his new Ford Explorer he got. I bought the Explorer. I don't need nobody to buy anything for my kids. Not then and not ever. They came to us for information, NCAA did, about other people's kids. My kids don't snitch. That's one thing that they learned growing up at a young age. I don't care what goes on in the street, you leave it in the street. And Big James told them. "If you want to know about James' shit, this is where you come." "Anybody else, there's the door." The point I really want to talk about in terms of NCAA rules and findings... Schea Cotton was never found guilty to have taken money or been routed to a particular school. I think Schea... Schea's family, in particular Mrs. Cotton, allowed her son to choose the school that he wanted to go to based upon what they believed the best opportunity was to be educated and play at the next level. TRIGONIS: They had a tight-knit family. Mother Gaynell was terrific. Very unique and engaging personality. Father James, famous for his cowboy hat, cowboy belt buckle, no nonsense... You know... Videotaping every game. You know, taking a smoking breakoutside at half-time. They were a slice of Americana. TROUPE: Without a doubt, genuine people, salt of the earth, honest communicators, look you in the eye... You know, Mr. Cotton was a quiet soul, strong man of few words. Mrs. Cotton was, you know, a jovial, outspoken, strong, African American woman. Similar to my mother so I connected with her. So I remember, you know, like it was yesterday, meeting Mrs. Cotton, and she said, "Well, baby, we don't have anything to hide. "Come on down whenever you like." I like to cook, and people wouldcome over to the house after games and I'd cook. And I'd cook and nobody'd bring nothing but I'd cook and they'd sit at the table and Big James would eat and go to bed, but I'd stay up and talk. My mom, you come in the house, she'd welcome you like you were a family member. She never met a stranger. TROUPE: I mean, we ate red beans and rice and all those Southern dishes. And so, over time, even though I had to ask them tough questions, they always took it in the spirit of my job. They never attacked me personally, which is rare. Most often the families that I dealt withwere critical of me or the NCAA. And they just treated me like a person and a man that had a job to do. And like I explained to him, we not taking anything. And they said to me, "These boys, they work. "They're gonna be taught the value of a work ethic. "We're not taking handouts. We don't need handouts." "We're gonna earn our way through this life." [HIP-HOP MUSIC PLAYING] Being recruited, it probably all started around seventh, eighth grade. Started receiving letters and stuff. I mean, big schools. Syracuse, UCLA, USC, Georgia Tech. All the bigger name schools. I used to get excited about that because I would watch them coach on the sidelines watching these games, and then see them sitting there watching me play. It was like, "Wow." Back in the mid '90s, early '90s, I was an assistant coach at the University of Kansas. We recruited California heavily. Jacque Vaughn from Muir High School. Paul Pierce from Inglewood High School. And the next guy we wanted was Schea Cotton. SCHEA: I had an early commitment, and I chose to go to Long Beach State strictly to play with my brother. You know, we always wanted to play together, never had a chance in high school. And the goal was for me and him to play a year together and play well enough to blow the lid off the Pyramid, and get as much exposure as we can and go as far as we can in the Conference Tournament. And then on into the NCAA tournament. And put our name in the hat, you know, and both go to the NBA. JAMES: I had a really good year. I started here and toward the end of the season I might go from 16 to 30. Mid first round to late first round. Work's slow at home, Dad's sick, so we had a meeting. I said, "Brother, you know", "I might have to go." When he decided to go hardship, I really thought about my decision. It really felt that I wanted to go elsewhere. And that's when I wrote a letterand asked to be released from my commitment. The school released him. But one of the coaches wanted stipulations. He told it to me. And I told him that release is unconditional. And the stipulation was that he can go anywhere but UCLA. Now, I'm telling you this but I haven't said this to nobody else. But, I mean, this is the end of the line. So... Because my husband might not make it, but... That's what happened. So Big James said he can go anywhere he feel like going, they gonna release him. So they did. Overnight the steering committee released Schea with no conditions meaning he can go anywhere. So he could go anywhere he wanted to go that next year. And that's when he went to summer school at UCLA. [ROCK SONG PLAYING] BARON: That was... That was a crazy summer, man. 'Cause it was like... When Schea said he was coming to UCLA, that was like... That was bigger news than my news and I was, you know, Gatorade Player of the Year and whatnot. I had finally arrived to where I was supposed to be. But when Schea came, it was like, oh, man, we for sure. We were ecstatic, man, because we had such a... During that time, we had the number onerecruiting class in the country. And I think with them, we had a chance to win a championship. Also never seen a guy work so hard. He was a professional. You could see he was gonna be one of the top players in the NBA in the future. So he was still, like, setting the bar. And every summer, we'd go to summer class, and then in the afternoon, all the pros came to the gym. Magics, Penny Hardaways, Hakeem Olajuwon at the time. Eddie Jones. Schea was going house on all of those. He was out there killing. Game of seven, he may, you know, he may score four. Jab. One. Two. Good. One more. Opposite. Good work. Good work. Get your money. Eat your breakfast. Jab. One. Two. Your shot. Yeah. Looking good, baby. You getting better today. Go straight up, sell it. Nice. You got it. Yeah. Uh-huh. I'll take that. JAMES: I'm flying to Seattle. I land to start training camp. My mom calls me and tells methey invalidated his test score. He can't go to school the next day to UCLA. Couldn't believe it. The day before school starts. It was uh... She told me. I remember she said, "I don't know how I'm going to tell him this" "but I just got word they invalidated his test score." And the headline was, "NCAA invalidates Cotton's SAT score." And it was like a shot to my heart. I felt so small. We had just finished up, we were waiting to get my gradesfrom my last class from FSP, and the bottom fell out. And I'll never forget the first day of school. We look around, it's like, "Yo, where's Schea?" "It's time to go to class. Where's Schea?" "Where's Schea at? Where's Schea?" "Schea's ineligible." I was like, "What?" You know, for us, it wasn't losing that ranking, and for me it wasn't losing a teammate, it was also losing a friend. You know, finally when he felt like he had a home or some comfort, some brotherhood with some dudes he could rock with, they cut his wings. JAMES: He tested for testing anxiety. So if there's a test, he gets nervous, so they gave him extra time to take it. Once that was recognized that I had a learning curve situation, it made a lot of sense to me because I thought I was different for the longest time. Not knowing that I had issueswith tests when they were timed. We can do anything we want till it comes to a test. He would just freeze. I mean, I could go to the DMV, and I'd know every question in the book, but when I get ready to take that written test, I freeze up, you know. But you put me behind the wheel of a diesel, I'd run you raggedy from here to New York. And back again. ALESIA WESLEY: One of the more common accommodations is the amount of time that a person takes the test. And providing a person that is experiencing testing anxiety with additional time, you would imagine how that decreases the amount of stress that they experience. So it allows them to be more relaxed, it allows them to process what they need to process, and subsequently be more successful in whatever they are attempting to do. He took the SAT with bold print and more time. And at that time, it was the ETS testing center and the NCAA. Well, the testing center agreed for him to take the test like this. And he had a counsellor that sat with him and administered this test. I'm the onethat proctored him in that test. And it was a one-on-one. He had it on a... It wasn't a timed test. He was documented to have a needfrom other sources, testing services, with the SAT. The manner in which the test was taken was okay for Long Beach State. But it wasn't okay for UCLA. But when James didn't go to school there, when he signed out to go on the draft, and Schea said he was going somewhere else, the problem started. That's it. Who did it? I don't know. Who had more to gain? Long Beach. I'm not crazy. Is it somebody from my school that did something to start all this? It just seemed like it to me. And I love my school, you know. But it just didn't seem right. Something didn't seem right to me. Yeah, that was hard. I mean, that was hard for me to deal with. Because in the back of my head, it was like, "Well, if I would have never went pro, we wouldn't have this problem." And that's what was challenged. The manner in which he took the test. Well, it wasn't us. It should have been challenged with the ETS center. But the NCAA instead went after us. UCLA was ready to fight. They really were. I'm telling you. They had attorneys everywhere that was ready to fight. But the NCAA, they would spend a fortune to hurt one kid. That's the worst organization in the world. And they make millions off of kids. For what? To destroy their lives. NARRATOR: Devastated by the news of Schea's invalidated test scores, the Cotton family was reeling, struggling to make sense of the situation. Where should he go? What should he do next? The family began weighing their options and searching for the next move to keep Schea's basketball dreams on track. What we had to do? We had to get him out of California. [HIP-HOP MUSIC PLAYING] Schea Cotton should be playing power forward for the UCLA Bruins. But he's not. He's back in high school for another year. We travel to Connecticut to find out why. SCHEA: At that time, I was just starting to get frustrated. You know, I didn't understand why people were picking on me. All I wanted to do was play. I didn't do anything wrong. What is this all about? And I started reviewing my options and realized that if I went to any other college, that my eligibility would start. So I did some research on some prep schools, and took a trip back east to a prep school in the tri-state area, St. Thomas More in Connecticut. JERE QUINN: I remember when Schea arrived, with his mom and dad, and I did the interview and they were instantly sold. They seemed to love our school. SCHEA: It was really cold in the wintertime. And it was just books and basketball. So there I honed my skills in my downtime 'cause I was, like, upset. I felt like I earned the rightto be playing Division One ball. You know, the biggest thing ishe had a hard time understanding why is this happening to him. All he wanted to do was really play basketball with his brother at Long Beach State. And his real dream was probably to play for UCLA. That's really where he wanted to go. I just remember on one of the laundry breaks, we put laundry clothes from the washer to the dryer, he just really broke down, ad he just started to cry. You know, you got to realize, when kids are going to prep school, kids are being there because they put themselves there. Whether they had bad grades, whether they had, um... You know, whether their behaviorwasn't up to par. But Schea was there not because of those reasons. I wanted to make some noise. In my head I didn't care where I was at. I wanted to make my presence felt and I wanted people to know that I could play. You can bottle me up all you want but it's gonna come out. During the prep experience at St. Thomas More, and then laterally into Long Beach City, when the NC State opportunity fell through, I did a lot of soul-searching. It was tough, man. I mean, I had days where I barely wanted to get out of bed. I had to really challenge myself and think about where I wanted to go with my life. And there were times I didn't want to be here. I was empty inside. I had nobody to relate to. I had to come back home and show my face where I made my name. Where they started calling me the man-child. And I felt embarrassed. I felt so many different emotions mixed up and nobody had the answers. And there came a time when I wanted to take my life. You know, I could remember I was in my father's pickup truck going somewhere, I can't remember where at the time and I called my girlfriend and told her. I said, "Now is the time" "for me to end it. I'm tired," "and I'm ready to go." Of the fighting, I'm tired of the fight. And she responded and told me, "Well, if you're gonna do it, come pick me up, I wanna go with you." And when she told me that... something went off in my head. I was like, "Wow, that's heavy," if I have that kind of impact... to do something maybe in a negative way, I could imagine what I could do if I put my mind to doing something powerful, something positive. And that stopped me from putting the trigger. I had a .357 out cocked, ready to go. And I had it up to my head... and when I thought about that, it's like my life flashed in front of me, and I saw my mother, and I saw my family, and... people crying, and... I froze. NARRATOR: The valley of the Manchild's life had reached its lowest low, but as Schea picked himself up yet again, opportunity came knocking. And Alabama came into the house, Gottfried, and Coach Kelsey, and... and told him he was gonna be able to play, and and that he was gonna be on the wing, and... and then all that was a bunch of lies. I was told that I need to play the power forward position, which ultimately really hurt me in my guard. My guard skills, they were what people could see when I used to showcase my ability. COMMENTATOR: They tried to take his game outside, I think, to show the NBA scouts what he can do and... on the drive there is Schea Cotton... It changed my game, it changed the look of me as a player, and ultimately, it changed the path of career. I guess, in fairness to Gottfried, looking back at the situation now, I can say this. I'm pretty sure nobody else is gonna say this, but all the big guys, two of them got hurt. So, there was nobody to play the forward spot. My brother, strong, athletic. You know, he could play anywhere. So, what he did was, he sacrificed Schea, to try to win games. So, he put him in the post. BOB GOTTLIEB: He had a solid year at Alabama. He had 15 games, but there were some coach-player differences. Christmas he came home, big James was diagnosed with prostate cancer, and that was the end of that. He wasn't going back, but what we didn't know was that Gottfried took the scholarship. NARRATOR: With his college playing days over, he only had one option. So, I decided, then, to draft for 99-2000 and hired an agent, and went through a couple of workouts, not many. Which was surprising. Everybody else had about 15-20 and I did, I think about two workout maybe. Before the draft started, me and brother went to get some... some hot wings. Enroute, I got a call from Orlando Magic and they were talking to me briefly as well as the Minnesota Timberwolves. They both were expressing interest that I'd be a mid/late first round pick. And that they had picks, and they were looking, really enquiring... thinking of picking me up if I was still available. But they heard that I was gonna be taken before them. So, man, we're going back with the wings. We're happy, we're like, yeah, worst case scenario, we know Minnesota. So, I was excited. I felt like I'd be a guaranteed first round lock and that I would get my name card at some point. I remember sitting down in the living room. It was all of us, and I remember when 13 was called. I remember him getting phone calls saying he would go no later than 11, I think. And then 13 was called. I forget who called, but anyway 13 went and that was it. So, to sit there and watch the whole draft, and my name never get called. That was one of the lowest points in my life. You know, not getting drafted after everything I put into the game. Words couldn't express the feeling. GEOFF HOLLIDAY: Then draft comes, he doesn't even get picked up. So, that was a blow to me, and I'm not even Schea Cotton. And... I was like "wow." How does a guy not make it to the NBA after everyone knows his talent? GAYNELL: It wasn't meant to be. He wasn't meant to be drafted. He just had a talent, and he can teach kids what to do, and what not to do. And hopefully, some of these yoyo parents will understand because if you take 'em, you're pimpin' your kids, and trust me, their lives will never be the same. Never! So, he never really got drafted, and it's a crime. It's an absolute crime that he's not in the NBA. He's by far the best young player, 6th grade to 9th grade that I ever saw in my life. Dick Vitale and a few other people told him the same thing. That money is gonna always be there. That's the biggest crock that could have been told. If the child got a chance to go and one of them parents or somebody they can trust can go with 'em, they need to send 'em. But otherwise, no. Let him go to school, or go to trade school, or do something, so he can take care of himself. 'Cause this sport, it destroys a lot of people. A whole lot of people is destroyed from basketball. NARRATOR: With Draft Day disappointment behind him, a determined Schea used the experience as fuel to get back on the basketball court. The one place he could always count on to be a sanctuary and a safe haven from life's tragedies. This time however, tragedy even followed him onto the court. Playing in the summer leaguein the NBA, I had an opportunityto play with Orlando Magic, in the Long Beach Summer League. It was a big opportunity and I was excited about it. I could remember the night before I met Conrad McRae, who I watched playing, growing up at Syracuse... "McNasty" they called him. We had dinner together the night before. Great guy, you know, just a calm, cool collected guy and we went through our first day and it was our second session... and we got through the practice and we were almost done and we were running some 17s, and I was running right next to Conrad McRae. I could remember we were on seven or eight, and we touched the line, and he stumbled, and it just sounded like... a bunch of weighs just hitting the floor. I mean, he's like 6'10, the man's like 270, probably somewhere in there, 265. I mean, he was solid, and it was just like, boom, boom, boom, boom. And I looked, it was like... like dead weight. I mean, he wasn't even moving. It shook me, I was just like "Man, what's up with my man. What's up with Conrad?" And as they got medical attention running over to help him because he was just out, like unconscious. And at that point I said something's wrong. I mean, he was laying on his face. They rolled him over on his back and... from my understanding, never revived him. Even though they didn't pronounce him dead at the gym, I knew he was dead on that floor, and that moved me in a different way. I learned a lot about life at that point, and I felt like I had a good opportunity to make that team, but it just seemed like, if I wasn't having bad breaks, I wasn't having any. NARRATOR: With the NBA seemingly in doubt again, Schea was left to weigh his options and make yet another decision. SCHEA: At that point, I turned pro. I wound up playing 10 years professionally. I went right into Euro League when I was undrafted. Played with a team in Belgrade, Yugoslavia. Formerly known, which is Serbia now. Played for Vlade Divac's team, KK Partizan. [COMMENTATOR SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE] And it was a great experience playing in Eastern Europe. Learnt the culture, the cuisine, getting to know the people walking in the center. Just really engulfing myself in the culture. It was one of the better growth experiences that I had. Just didn't have the consistency playing wise that I would have liked. I mean, I played well, but sometimes I didn't play for two games. JAMES: If you don't know too much about Eastern Europe, 'cause I played there too after NBA, the coaches are like old school. Throwback coaches. They like, tough, tough, tough, tough, tough. Talent, they don't care, they just want tough. So, if you're skilled, they just want you to be a tough, hard nose... He was with a East European Coach that was like a tyrant. Evidently the coach didn't care for the Americans, and I was one of the first to go into that country to play under those circumstances, and my money was secure, but my playing time wasn't. So, it was difficult from that aspect, but it was a great experience as far as worldview. Other countries I played in was France, Greece, Italy, I played in China, Venezuela, Dominican Republic. Played all through CBA, the USBA, NBDR, did all the minor league circuits in North America. Globetrotters... had all those experience, so I felt like I've done a lot. It was a real ride, but my pro career was more of a slap in the face than anything. HOLLIDAY: Why didn't Schea make it into the NBA? Oh, man, I've tossed and turned with this question my... my whole life. [SIGHS] Why didn't Scheamake it? That's a good question, man, I've actually pondered that in my own mind because like I said, when I saw him play as a sophomore, I would have bet any money I would have earned 20 years down the line that he was gonna be in the league. He was just not gonna be in the league, he was gonna be a superstar in the league. Don't leave Mater Dei. Stay in one school. MAN: I don't know if it mattered if he transferred high school, or didn't matter. If he went to 12 schools, he was gonna dominate wherever he went. His coaches never really enforced that he had to defend, just like everybody else, the line, the wings, the front, the post, to help them recover... he could just stand around block shorts, and rebound. The world has a perception of where you should be at that point, and I think when he wasn't exactly at that point in their eyes, and he wasn'tjust averaging 50 points a game. 'Cause that's the pace he was on. He was on the pace where his first year in college, he should have been averaging 40-50 points a game. MAN: His gap was so wide as a Sophomore, against anybody else in his class, I think that it was only inevitable that the gap is gonna close some way. That's a complicated question, and then, there's not an easy answer for that. Maybe his game didn't translate as effectively at the highest level. I know fo sho it wasn't 'cause of talent. If I look at what I know, all the facts that I have, and I know the circumstances, the environment of collegiate professional sports. I've been working here for 20 years, so I know it. I would say that it was a combination between outside influences and Schea not being able to play the position that he was suited to play. He got black balled, he was ousted by whoever, Long Beach or UCLA. I mean, whichever one it is. JAMES SR: Blame belongs to one organization. You know, so... They know who they are, we know who they are. I'd say that... the system failed him. I think college ultimately led to his demise and not really ever, ever achieving his dream. MAN: He should have went overseas. There was no reason for Schea Cotton to be playing high school basketball when your skill level is at professional level. You know, whether you say it was God's will, or it was something that Schea was missing, the reality is, he's a better person now for it. And he's helping more kids, and to me, anybody that's about helping the kids, I'm about them. SCHEA: Let's do it. [CLAPS] Game time. This is gonna help all your moves in the game. Good. Eyes up. There you go. Better. Good job... MOSS: I don't know what reason he didn't make it to the NBA, but I just wanted to be able to let him know man, that he influenced me to be able to choose my path of not trying to second guess myself. If I wanted to go to college and be a two sport athlete, he helped that decision. It was so much shit. It was damn, how do y'all pile all this on a kid? The greatest misfortunes that can befall any young athlete is the cancer of early success, and the recognition of that success. But, someone who was as dominant as he was at an early age, he would be led to believe that he was at the peak of his basketball career and his basketball journey would have only been beginning. I was stripped of my... what I thought was going to be my future. A long term career in the NBA. I came out with Kobe Bryant, and guys of that nature. I didn't get the breaks Kobe got, consequently I'm here telling my story, but none the less, I feel like I'm blessed. I can touch you guys and girls, day in and day out. [APPLAUSE] You can't look at it as failure when your story becomes more powerful than it did if your dream came true. And I don't wanna get it twisted. This is not, like I said I believe this story lends itself to damn-near everything in life. So, it's not just basketball. I want my kid to be able to sit down and look at this man's story and be able to learn from it. Yeah, absolutely. I think it helps all the kids. Some of these kids have real false hopes. They all think they're division one players, they're not. A lot of them are division two. They're gonna have a great time in college, get a scholarship, play division two basketball. But they'll wanna try to do so much, and here's a guy, he did it all. Oh, it's very important, because he has a powerful message, and our younger kids today need to hear those type of messages. We all aspire to be successful in our chosen field if we work hard at it. But sometimes with fate, it doesn't happen. Like, this guy was the best of the best, so because he was the best, there was a process to becoming the best. And Schea can speak to that process, what it really takes to becomes the best, and then he can speak to the valley when you fall off the mountain. When the bully socks you in the mouth, what you're supposed to do, and he's done that. The bully in this case was the institution of athletics that socked him in the mouth... in the gut and took him down for a period of time. I was a great player in high school, I was good in college, and a lot of people thought I would end up playing a lot of years in the NBA. It didn't happen, and again, why doesn't it happen? And you can tell a story, and players will listen to that. SCOOP: My calling though this game of basketball wasn't necessarily about me becoming the next so-and-so. Me being the first Lebron James. The fact that I was... I could back in the day beat Kobe, but I never became Kobe. That wasn't my path. My path was different, my path was bigger. HOLLIDAY: Life isn't all about basketball. But, you can learn a lot about life through basketball. He almost needs to be a mainstay to everyone in the country. I mean, regardless of shoe brand. I don't care if it's Nike, I don't care if it's Under Armor, Adidas. Anybody that does any event with kids in America, they need to have him a part of it. And the reason why I say this, and it's not arrogance to him, it's not bias on my part... majority of the kids at those events won't go through what he went through. They won't be as good as he was. To be in a position to take a scholarship from UCLA NC state, and eventually still go to Alabama. Some of 'em won't even do that. But to keep them humbled and bring it all back home is to say, I had all that, and I didn't make it. This is now the time to use it. Back then... I shouldn't even say used, back then he was exploited. Now, he's for everyone's use. I don't wanna say his story's more important, than the life he lived through basketball, but I do believe that his place in basketball right now may be more important than it would have been had he fulfilled the dream that we expected him to fill. But one day, he'll get his due. Yeah, one day. JAMES SR: Someday... there's gonna be another kid that's gonna come along. That's gonna be, not a Schea Cotton, he'll be himself... but he'll be equally as good to come out of California. And that will play pro-ball. And I think that Schea will be one to bring him. That'll be poetic justice, for the family and for Schea.
