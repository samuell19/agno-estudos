- Dad? - Dad, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry, I screwed up. I'm in trouble. Please help. Hang up the phone. Show me your hands. Oh God! - It was right here. - You sure you have the right- - Yes, I'm fucking sure! It was right fucking here! Somebody saw me here and they moved it. - Why would anyone do that, senor? You do realize by coming in here unaccompanied, you're trespassing? - The gate was open. - Still trespassing. Look, senor, perhaps you were mistaken. It's a very common car. Maybe there was a similar car to your daughter's and the owner just happened to come and pick it up when you came for me. Who knows? - I know. I fucking know. The goddamn plates were on the car, I told you that. - Well, unfortunately, Senor Beckwith, we see this sort of thing all the time. A gringo like you finds out someone he loves has disappeared close to the border, and he just points his finger south at all those dangerous brown people living just across the bridge. - Don't play that bullshit card with me, you got that? - As I've said, Mr. Beckwith, there's no proof your daughter or her friend ever even came here to Juarez. - Her friends came here to party. They saw them. They got no reason. Look, I said the fucking plates were on the car! It's her car. - Perhaps. Unless these so-called friends are the ones responsible for their disappearances in the first place. You should go home, Mr. Beckwith. This is no place for you. I told you, if we find anything, I will call you. Officer Sandoval here will escort you back to the border. - Hey. Lauren. - What? You promised to keep us safe. You didn't. Get out! - She didn't mean it, you know? She's just hurting like the rest of us. - No, she meant it. And she's right. - Sean, you didn't know where she was going. Neither of us did. She knew how we felt about her crossing the border. That's why she didn't tell us - When she left for school, I was sick for a week. I didn't tell you, but every day, sick to my stomach. And I was worried about Daddy's little girl in the big city, the big dangerous city. Then she comes home for one day. One fucking day. She wanted to bring Lauren- - What are you doing? This is bad enough already without imagining how it could be worse. What happened today? What's going on, Sean? You're talking like it's hopeless. Look at me. I don't believe that. I can't. Where did you get this? - Leigh's car Where? - In Juarez. Impound lot somewhere outside the city. - Oh, no. I mean, was there, was there any sign of? - No, there was nothing. Nothing I could see, no struggle. That's good, right? You told the police? - Yeah. And by the time we got back to the lot, the car was gone. - How is that possible? What did the police say, Sean? - They're in on it. - What are you saying? Sean? - I know. - How you holding? - I'm holding. - Yeah? Any leads? - I'll tell you over a beer. - So obviously they're fucking in on it. Can't say I'm surprised. Mexico's a hard place to be a good cop. What about our team? - Well, um, border patrol has 'em crossing the bridge, her and her friend, at 1900, about a week ago, Monday. And they confirm there was no return. - And they're sure about that? - 100%. - So what now? What are they doing to help? - Well, there's not much they can do. Their reach ends at the border. - Look, she is out there, brother. Right? And we will find her. Look, um, I mean, I don't know if it'll do you any good, but I was able to get you a meeting with the US Consul General. And the other girl's old man, too, if he's interested. - Huh, I've been trying to get in there since this whole thing began, man. I tell you, they haven't even called me back. - Sometimes I guess it just pays to be a charming, sexy-ass motherfucker, you know? - So how did that work with you? I appreciate that. I really appreciate that, brother. - You know, I am there whenever, wherever. You know that, right? - I know that. Good. If it were me, I'd forgo all this political bullshit. Roll over there, grab that dirty cop, waterboard the shit out of him til he start talkin'. - And what if he didn't? - Blowtorch and pliers. - If that didn't work? Then what? - Fuck, I don't know, man. I would light that place up and burn that whole fucking town to the ground. - Well, you hold that thought. I'll do it my way for now, all right? - You let me know if you change your mind. - Consul General Marcus Dobson. - Sean Beckwith. This is John Langencamp. He's, uh, Billie's dad. - Good to meet you both. Please, have a seat. I can't tell you how sorry I am to hear about your daughters. I'm a father myself. Look, I wish I could say this type of thing was something incredibly unusual, but I can't. Since this past fall alone, 23 Americans and at least 400 locals have gone missing. - Okay. So what can you do? - There isn't a great deal we can do. Unfortunately, most of the authorities here are in bed with the cartel. Can't really blame 'em. Most people would rather take a bribe than a bullet. - What do you mean? - Six months ago, a tough-talking new police chief got himself elected. Later that day a truckload of gunmen blasted into his house in broad daylight. They killed him, his wife, and his four children. The guy was just trying to do the right thing, and by sundown he and his entire family were dead. You see, it sent a message. In Juarez, you either get on board with the cartel or. - So are you saying you think this cartel might have something to do with what happened to our girls? - It's a possibility. Or perhaps it's just as likely your daughters went to that party, took a hit off the wrong joint, and OD'd. Someone panicked and- - Leigh doesn't do drugs. - All right, if you say so. - I just did. - Well, if it was the cartel, then they've probably been taken to one of their safe houses until ransoms are paid. - No one's asked for any money. - Shit, I don't have any money even if they did, but yeah, we've heard nothing. - Or. - Or what? - Your daughters are beautiful girls. Maybe someone grabbed 'em and shipped 'em off to one of their clubs. - Clubs? Jesus. - Look, I'm sorry. I'm not trying to be insensitive. Like I said, I have a daughter myself. I would want someone to be straight with me in your position. - This Juarez cartel, who are they? - They call themselves Los Mercenarios. They're as bad as it gets. Known for their brutality, their shock and awe tactics. - Shock and awe? - Beheadings, torture, you name it. - They're all ex-Mexican military. - Former counter-narco commandos. Many of them are even trained by our own military at Fort Bragg. Only now they've gone rogue and ply their trade moving narcotics, sex trafficking, and gunrunning. - It sounds like you're telling us that there's nothing you can do. - Look, I don't think you understand, Mr. Langencamp. This is literally one of the most dangerous places in the world right now. Just this last weekend, there were 39 killings, including the murders of three police officers. The two of you, just coming here and poking around, you're playing with fire. - She's an American citizen, General. She's my daughter. - Look, I know your background, Colonel. These guys are savages. Every bit as ruthless as what you faced in the sandbox. Don't make the mistake of underestimating what I'm saying here. They've got connections on both sides of the border, and trust me on this, they don't care what color your passport is. - Thanks for your help. - Mercenarios are business first, Colonel. You get in the way of that business, they sense a threat, or think there's an example to be made in any way, and. Three men died last night in a confrontation between 19 to 20- - Jesus. Members over a drug deal- - Sean! That borders the Hotel Especial Cancun and the Silver Pearl Beach Resort. Another person identified as a hotel guest was hospitalized for a head injury. The US government is warning Americans to exercise extreme caution due to crime and kidnapping. - Look at where we are. This is insane. And to ourselves. In the wake of shootings between rival- - Look, I want Billie back too, as much as you want Leigh, as much as any father would, but Sean. - Two south Texas girls are missing in Mexico, and their parents believe it may have something to do with the local cartels there. Leigh Beckwith and Billie Langencamp, both 18, are believed to have crossed the border into Juarez early last week to attend a party and haven't been seen or heard from since. Leigh Beckwith's parents, including her father, Colonel Sean Beckwith, a decorated former United States Marine, held a press conference at their ranch earlier today and made an impassioned plea for both girls. - My daughter didn't just disappear. She and Billie didn't just up and run off without a word. Someone out there knows what happened, where they are. We are begging for the safe return of both Leigh and Billie wherever they might be. We, as well as the Langencamps, just want our daughter back. - If your daughter should be listening to this right now, is there anything you'd like to say to her? Leigh, we love you so much. - Yeah. Oh yeah, um. Leigh, I'll find you. Wherever you are, whoever you may be with, I'll find you. - No, no, no! - Listen to that. Wonder what's got them so riled up. Where are you? - I'm right here - No, you're not. Babe, talk to me. - What do you want me to say? - Really? - I got nothing, Susan, I, my words have no meaning. I- I'm worthless. - No. No, you don't get to do that. It's not fair, Sean. You don't get to shut me out. You're not the only one missing a daughter. - I'm sorry. You're right. You're right, I'm sorry. - I know. It's killing me too. Now we just have to have faith. - Here you go. Hey, hey. Come on. There you go, babe. - What's going on? - Coyote. - Multiple systems reeling on high-band. Latest military-grade jammers. 360 coverage. Other than your team's radio frequencies, aren't any calls coming in or out of that ranch. - Have they seen us? - Susan! - Mom? - Yeah, honey? - What's going on? - It's nothing. It's dad. He's just looking for a coyote. - Susan! - Oh Jesus. Shit! - The phone's dead! - Get away from the window. Go upstairs, get my gun in the office. - Sean, what's going- - Fucking go! - Call 911. Oh my God. - What? - There's no service. - Hey, baby. No. No, of course I'm not at Manny's. You know I can't eat that garbage. Yeah. No way. I know, right? Dispatch to Sheriff Riggins. Do you copy? We have a report of shots fired. Over. - Hang on, baby. I got a call coming in. Go for Riggins. Over. Sheriff, we have reports of automatic gunfire at the Beckwith ranch. - Wait, what? The call came from Bill Mitchell. Heard what sounded like a full-fledged gunfight coming from the Beckwith ranch. - Alpha! Delta! No, no, no, no! - Shh, shh, shh, shh! - Sean! - Dad! Okay. - Shh! - Dad? - Dad! - Sean! Out the window. Out the window now! Right behind you. - Stay behind me. Really? That's your plan? Threaten to shoot the guy I sent up first? The same guy, I almost killed him myself last night. Carlos. Carlos? - What the hell? Fuck! Sheriff Riggins to dispatch. Over. - Riggins to dispatch. Over. What the hell's wrong with this piece of shit? Oh, shit! - Fuck! - Fuck it. - Dad? - Sean! - Go to the truck. - How about you? - I can't leave him alone. Go! - Dad! - Sean! Sean! Go, go, go! Go! Yes! Come on, come on! Come on, come on! Come on! Come on! Come on! - You okay? - She's okay. I've got her. - Oh God! - What? - Down! - Mag! My daughter. Where is she? - Fuck you. You are a dead man. You and your whole family are. - I'm giving you one more chance. My daughter. Where is she? I don't fucking know! Wait, wait, wait! Those policias, they took her. Your daughter and her friend. They were given as gifts. - To who? To my brother, Victor! He's the leader of Los Mercenarios! - Where do I find him? - In Juarez! I can take you down there. We own the whole city. You will need me there. Don't leave. You can't just leave me out here. - Okay. I won't. Susan! Now! Come! Come, come! Let's go! Now! Come! - Lauren, baby. Stay with me. - Now! - Come on! Come on. - Let's go! Get in. Come on. Come here, it's okay. - What's happening? - It's okay. Come on. Here you go, baby. Sit down. I need your phone. Okay? Whoever's still out there, they're not gonna be looking for this truck. So you drive right to the Rizzi's place, go slow and steady, do not stop. Then you call the police. - Sean, no, I'm not gonna lose you too. What are you gonna do? I'm going to get Leigh. Sean! - Yeah? - Yo, remember the way you said you played? - I remember. - You ready? - You just say the word. - Look, they found me. The scum that took Leigh, they found me. They came to my house. They came after my family. Jesus, man, are you all right? - I know who they are. Victor Garza. Mercenarios cartel. Okay. Where are you? - The old Big Chief off 86. - All right. Let me just get my gear. All right, so that's our boy. Victor Garza. The story of his exploits would curl a maggot's stomach. You know? Bad as it gets. And that is his address. Ain't exactly a secret. As far as he's concerned, he's un-fucking-touchable. For good reason, I guess. He's got an army. Come here. - How are we gonna get all this in? - Nobody trying to keep shit out of Mexico. Just shit leaving. We ain't bringing this back. - Look, this is probably gonna be it. I need you to be sure. You sure? - You know what? I'm almost offended you gotta ask me that. - Let's go then. - He's there. - And how many you figure he has with him? - 10, 20, with a QRF of another 50 on standby. - And how much time you think we have once they know we're inside? - Before the QRF is on us? Maybe 10 minutes. Gear up. Get their shit together. - Look, whether she's alive or not, nobody's getting out of there. - Yeah well, I wouldn't have it any other way. You're not looking for a hug right now, are you? - Jesus, shut the fuck up. Let's jog. Yes, sir. Our team will get there as soon as possible. - Don't move. Drop it. Drop it. - What do you want? Money? It's yours. Name your price. - Nah, there's not enough money in the world for you to slip the reckoning you got coming. - I don't even know who the fuck you are. - You remember me? - Wait! - Where's my daughter? - Where's my brother? Oh, Santisima Muerte has blessed you this day. - You'd better tell me she's alive. - Okay. She's life. - You took my daughter, you fucking motherfucker! - You sent your fucking dogs to my house! Please. - What? - What'd you say? - She's alive! She's alive! - Where? I'll take you to her. - Where? Where the fuck is she? She, she, she's at the edge of town. - Sean. We gotta roll. - She's, she's close. She's very close. - Let me tell you something, motherfucker. You're lying, you're gonna fucking regret me not finishing you off right now. - Hey, what's with the, uh, severed animal heads and the gory altars on the side of the road, huh? Hey, fucko! I'm talking to you. They are offerings. - Offerings, huh? - Yes. To Santisima Muerte. - Who? - The patron saint of death. We pray to her for protection. - How's that working out for you, huh? - What we do is against God. So we can only pray to her to watch over us when we die. What's waiting for us inside? I- I don't know. I'm guessing that most of my men are on their way to the hacienda. - What's your signal? You got a special knock, a signal? Yes. Yes, yes. - Go. - I hope you die! No! No, no, no, no! - Hi, baby, hi! It's Daddy. - Dad? Dad? - It's Daddy. - I'm sorry. - Hi, baby! Hi, it's Daddy. - I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. - I love you. - I'm so sorry. - We have to go. Easy. Fuck! Come on, Billie. - No! No! - You have to get up. - I can't. No, I can't! - Come on! - I can't! Okay. - Get the fuck outta here. You take your time. - Go. - Santisima Muerte. My protector when I die. Well, shit, I don't know, but for your sake, I hope you're right.
