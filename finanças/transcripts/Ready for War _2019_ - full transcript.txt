Something else came home. And, uh... You know, how am I supposed to die, man? What am I--what is supposed to become of my life, you know? You live by the sword, you wanna die by the sword.

No mercy. ♪ Suspenseful music ♪ Hey, what's up? ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ The deported US military veterans-- it almost sounds like an oxymoron, but believe it or not, a large number of former military servicemen and women have been deported. A law dating back to President Bill Clinton's administration allows the federal government to deport any non-citizen who commits certain crimes, even some minor crimes. Now, this applies even if they've served in the military. Many vets we talked with told us they were promised citizenship by their recruiters and others told us that they thought they became citizens when they took oath to join the military. The battle against deportation continues for an army veteran living in Chicago. Private First Class Miguel Perez Jr. Entered the US as a legal permanent resident. He was later convicted of a nonviolent drug charge, which is grounds for deportation. After serving almost eight years in prison, ICE immediately took Perez into custody. He is truly a wounded warrior, a young man who served our country, who suffered from two traumatic brain injuries. Call on ICE, on the US Government, on our elected officials, our senators, and representatives to release him. I'm the mother of a hero. My son is my hero. I'm very strong... like my son. Thank you for your support. ♪♪♪ Well, Miguel Perez is a case where he ends up being given parole for good conduct. I think he finishes a college degree while he's in prison, you know, turned his life around. He thought he was going to walk out of prison and go home and start his life all over, but instead, he ends up spending another couple years in prison with ICE. I've been very proud to serve the military and was wounded in Operation Iraqi Freedom. I ended up losing both my legs and... a lot of the function of my right arm and spent a year recovering at Walter Reed. It was at Walter Reed that I became a veteran's advocate. So, most Americans would be surprised to know that we deport veterans because they'd be surprise to know that we actually have people who served this nation in uniform, who swear that they would lay down their lives to protect our freedom, who are not yet citizens, who are green card holders, or are permanent legal residents. These folks would not be deported had they been granted their American citizenship in the first place. So, we now have a population in places like Tijuana of American veterans, who are still deserving veterans benefits but who can't get access to them and who can't even come back in the country that they defended. Hello? - Hi, Daddy. - Hi. What are you doing? Well, today was my first day of school. I saw those pictures. Yeah, that's beautiful. How do you like school today? Good. Are you playing your games? - Yeah. - What are you playing? I'm doing good in school. I finished my homework already at the afterschool program. That's good. I miss you. I miss you, too. I'm glad you had fun this weekend. Pretty soon, I'll be out there eventually, right? Dear Hector, it's been a long road. You're 40 years old. You were born in Mexico and came from a farming community in Zacatecas. You came to the US at the age of seven. You had the opportunity to live the American dream. As you got older and your parents made the decision to move to Compton, California, things changed. You were sometimes bullied and your family was discriminated. You eventually decided to get away and made one of the best decisions in your life. You joined the US military for many reasons. You wanted to get away from the neighborhood that you were growing up in, promise of citizenship, promise of an education and a career, most important, serving your country being a GI Joe. The first jump was scary. I clearly remember the opening of the canopy and looking up at the beautiful sky. You hit the ground like a sack of potatoes. The night jump was beautiful. Eventually, you were chaptered with an honorable discharge. You started having issues with drugs and alcohol. You put yourself in a position where somebody fired a weapon and you ended up going to prison. You're supposed to parole till Immigration picks you up. This can't be. You served in the military. How could they deport you? You have a beautiful daughter that you can't be with. She is the most important thing in your life. I can't blame anybody but myself. I put myself in the situation. I put myself in the circumstances. I don't blame God. I made bad decisions, but at the end of the day, I still consider myself an American, a patriot. I will keep fighting to go home. I'm proud of my service. I wouldn't take it back. And if I had to do it all over again, I would serve my country and put my life on the line. You've been doing good. It's been 13 years since you've been in prison, hoping one day you would live the American dream. ♪ Dramatic music ♪ It's an upside-down flag, which if you're in the military, it's distress or we're being overrun or we need help. Deported in 2004, Hector Barajas runs a shelter here in Tijuana nicknamed The Bunker where deported veterans can get help with job prospects, immigration advice, and legal service. You know, the support house is another animal in itself. It's very difficult to work with some of the guys. It's a big responsibility-- getting the bills paid, getting the guys going. It's very difficult. Very difficult. I've had some very difficult people to work with. We are--we are very difficult people to work with. Today, we have some special visitors. One of our deported veterans who's a Navy veteran, Juan Llamas, actually knows how to work with prosthetics. And today, they're gonna get an impression on his foot. So we're gonna see what they can do for Jaime. Like we said, we're gonna make him walk. You know, I do enjoy it, especially when I see guys doing good. Like, they get their jobs. They get their own place. And that's when you're like, you know, it's worth it. Everything that you go through. So, Fernando Orozco, who's a deported veteran, is also a barber, and he's gonna be doing free haircuts, and today-- so we squared him away with some clippers and some scissors and all the equipment that he's gonna need for-- to do some haircuts. And his first guinea pig is his brother, who is also a deported veteran, and both of them served in South Korea, so we're gonna-- Let's see how it's going down. There we go. He's getting a mushroom look over here. My commitment is to help these guys out, and that's what I've been trying to do. You know, at end of the day, at least they could say, "I had a place to stay," you know. That's-- And that's better than anything, you know? Hector is the... quintessential story of America. This is someone who came to this country, who wanted a better life. This is someone who is willing to die for this country, who served this country. This is someone who made mistakes, who admits his mistakes, who owns and takes accountability for his mistakes. I don't think there is a better tale of what makes America great than the tale of Hector Barajas. We know how to make a difference. We know how to drive change. You know, yesterday was a perfect reflection when we talked about two years ago I was approached by a group, and they said, "We have this issue of deported vets." And I said, "No, no. You got bad information. You can't deport a veteran." Because I was in the Marine Corps, and I remember the naturalization services. I said, "You do one day of military service, you get citizenship." I didn't know that we had systematically failed to fulfill that commitment. Think about the psychological impact of being-- You were willing to-- you loved this country enough, you were willing to die for this country, and you come home, and you're struggling, and that country kicks you out. And we said, "That's not enough. We've got to do better. We can do better." One category of veterans who are primarily white and happen to have been born here, when they lose their way and commit an offense, we have a veterans' court, and we have treatment, and we have diversion programs. But for that other category of veterans who wore the same uniforms, who slept in the same mud, who fought in the same battles, for that category of veterans, we have diversion treatment as well. We divert you back to a country that you may or may not know. You know, there are so many different reasons why this situation is horrific and is intolerable, but another one is as simple as the fact that we can't export those who we've trained at the highest levels to be effective in combat situations to environments where they're prone to be recruited into things that would be detrimental to the--to the United States. They're the first ones that the drug lords and the cartels will prey on. ♪ Suspenseful music ♪ I grew up... as an American in my youngster years. I was raised in El Paso. Got there when I was 10 years old. I joined the services because I wanted respect for myself, for my family. I wanted something to be proud of. I needed some discipline in my life, and so I joined the Army. We were proud, you know. We were helping people. We were good soldiers, and all of a sudden, things just changed for me dramatically. I got into some trouble. I committed an assault on another dude for shitty stuff, which it was-- it was a necklace. And the government just threw me out. Being here in Juárez, I wasn't used to the life here. I missed the US. When I got here back in 2010, it was-- it was like a horror movie. I was alone. And--because of all that I left in the US, it hit me. It hit me hard. Part of the cartels, they have their own lieutenants. We can say it's a type of like a lieutenant. Now these people, they're ruthless. They're cold. They don't care. They have no respect for life, women, kids. It don't matter. And they said not only you will be killed. Your family, your mother, your father, your brothers, everyone will be killed. I felt it was necessary for me to do this, to stay alive. So now I have to face my reality. I'm on the other side now. Well, usually every two or three weeks, they gather a group of people and I train them. We're out in the desert. I'm training people to kill. ♪ Suspenseful music ♪ Violence is a very precious resource for criminal organizations. It's a valuable resource. It's a resource that can be exploited. If you don't want... drug cartels to have military training, but you are creating a scenario where they could. Well, Mexico is now the second deadliest country in the world after only Syria, Shannon. While they're in a civil war, Mexico's violence is attributed to only one thing-- drugs. My name is Michael Vigil. I was with the Drug Enforcement Administration for 31 years. Worked undercover extensively in Mexico. I was the chief of international operations and, therefore, responsible for all DEA operations outside the continental United States. The war between Juárez and the Sinaloa Cartel rages on. And Juárez has become one of the most violent and deadly cities in the world. ♪ Dramatic music ♪ Mexico saw a record 2,186 murders in May, 30 % more than last year and the most in two decades. The capture of former Sinaloa Cartel leader, El Chapo, and others, returned, fueled largely by the US meth and heroin epidemic. Juárez is a primary drug trafficking route for the Sinaloa Cartel, for the Juárez Cartel, because probably about 60 % to 70 % of the drugs that are smuggled across into the United States go through the Juárez-El Paso corridor. The Juárez Cartel has proclaimed their prohibition against the use or distribution of methamphetamine because that is a market that is basically cornered by the Sinaloa Cartel. Well, the veterans that are deported into Mexico are gonna be put in the hands of a very deadly, deadly enemy. It's the old saying of plata o plomo. You either take our money or you take our lead or our bullets. They are reluctant individuals that are put into a precarious situation not of their choice. And I think that that is a very deplorable standard that we have used for people that really have done a great job as soldiers for this country. So, I want to hear a little bit about your childhood. Did you grow up as an American? There's no precedent that I have seen for them granting citizenship back in time, but we're gonna make it a precedent. This will be the first one, I really believe that, because it makes sense, you know. Let's give him citizenship like we should have when he was in basic training, when he was in jump school, when he was being trained as a mechanic, when he went the first time to the war and put his life on the line for the country, when he went the second time. And if he is a citizen back to the time he went to war, his subsequent crime after he got back would have no effect on him. He'd be allowed to be here. He'd get out of the jail. Today, Illinois US Senator Tammy Duckworth sent an urgent letter to the secretary of Homeland Security asking the Trump Administration to stay Perez's deportation and review his case. Perez's lawyer says, "If there's any case to review, it's that of a veteran who served two tours of war." I just don't see any argument about-- well, you come back damaged from a war and then there's something bad and you get no breaks, you get no mercy, you never can redeem yourself. That makes no sense. God bless you. Take care. This is. This is where a lot of the people that deported they end up at, and basically people end up being homeless. A couple of thousand people, like, live in this area, shooting up, and, you know. If you get depressed, if you go through all these different issues, you could end up down here. So part of our work is to make sure that these guys don't end up homeless, that they don't end up addicted. Yeah, you don't want to end up here. This is a no-man's-land. ♪♪♪ The military was very structured for me. I got out of the military, and then transitioning is very difficult. Addiction has been one of the issues that I've had all my life, and that's what end up getting me deported. Good evening, everybody. This is Specialist Barajas down here at the Deported Veterans Support House. And I wanna get home to my daughter hopefully soon. And hopefully, I'll be the first deported veteran to come home as a US citizen. So, right now, we're in the process of citizenship, so hopefully we should find out whether I become an American citizen or not. I have no expectations, but I also hope for the best, you know, just to, you know, kind of wait and see what happens. I have some really, really, good news. I-- I'm going to be issued a interview for citizenship within 60 to 90 days, and I should be back in the United States pretty soon to get my interview. So this is fucking good news. Oh, yeah. I don't want to be here for another ten years or five years and see my daughter grow up without me. So I'm hoping that we get a decision. I can take her to school and help her with her homework and be there for her when she needs me. To be honest with you, I know that I needed her probably more than that she needs Dad, so that's, you know, it's important for me to hopefully, you know, get that chance to be a father for the second time.

And we ask, O God, that you would change hearts, and change minds and change laws that someday the families of the earth would be reunited. Hector is the best possible example of somebody who has completely turned his life around-- from a place where he was really struggling reintegrating into society after leaving the military to a place where he is singlehandedly running a shelter for deported veterans, leading really what has become international advocacy on this issue, and giving everything of himself. But it doesn't require that either. We're not requiring sainthood, you know. People are able to learn from their mistakes and improve their lives. And we shouldn't be separating fathers and mothers from their children who have lived their whole lives in the United States, have fully committed and invested in this country. ♪♪♪ During his next hearing, his attorney will argue that the cartels in Mexico could threaten Perez. They know, you know, you've got weapons training, military training, you have ins with people in the United States, and you're gonna work for us. In the most perverse way I've ever seen, we're actually training people to then come back and fight against us. These folks are especially vulnerable to being, um, uh, recruited, and then by recruited, I mean, forcibly given a choice between death and joining the gangs. I've looked at a lot of the deported veterans that have military skills that have basically created a national security threat, not only for Mexico, but, you know, that violence has spilled over into the United States. Five, six years ago, you would look at pictures of, uh, drug cartel shootouts, and you would see a dead body in a wall with a hundred bullets behind that. Nowadays, you see a dead body with two shots to the chest and one in the groin. That's how military members shoot. So you have to ask yourself, who's teaching them to shoot, or who is doing the shooting? ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ If someone sends you, you just have to do it. If you don't do it, they're gonna kill you.

Well, it was, like-like, five or six, after five or six victims, it's-it's- it's-it's tough, it's tough. So I would like to get out of this, but I can't.

I'm trying my best to, uh, to keep them out of that and keep them structured. The Support House for the last couple of years has really helped me, uh, stay focused. No deported veteran has ever gone home as a US citizen, and I wanna be the first one. I'll tell you right now, if we're successful in bringing Hector back, it is a-a light in a sea of darkness. I'm not saying that the-these vets didn't-didn't do what they did. Uh, and I'm not even saying the penalty, which they all already paid-- They already completed their penalty for the offense of which they committed was too great. What I'm saying is because of that conviction, what the federal government did is the injustice. And the only way that we can right that wrong is by pardoning the original offense, because if that original offense is pardoned, then their legal status is restored and they're eligible for citizenship. Um, I'm over here with Nathan Fletcher, and, uh, I got a pardon from the-- from the governor of California. Uh, awesome. I-I can't talk over here. So I'm very happy to tell everybody that I got a pardon from the State of California, from the governor. Oh, my God, this is huge. I can, uh-- I can--it--it'll be-- uh, the process will be easier for me to go home to my family, so, uh, I'm just very thankful and I've been-- uh, uh, uh, I'm just still, like, uh, at a loss for words. You never-- when you were out there in the States, you never thought about getting it, or-- Oh, no. Yeah, yeah. Like, I got the Airborne tattoo in the back, and the guys keep-- uh, most of the guys I run into keep thinking it's Alcoholic Anonymous. So, we have, um, received the pardon from the governor for Hector. And that should enable him to naturalize immediately. There should be no question about his eligibility to naturalize. However, we're seeing that the government is just continuing to sit on it and we're not seeing progress, and so we're not sure, you know, which way it's gonna go, whether we're gonna have to take his case to federal court, um, or whether the government will finally move his case along and issue a decision. A Chicago war veteran who served two tours at Afghanistan is now facing deportation. Tomorrow, a judge will decide his fate. Good? Everybody good? All right. - Yeah. - All right. So, I was in an interview this morning with Miguel and two officers from Immigration, USCIS. Um, they basically did all the regular things that would happen. They interviewed him. Did the citizenship test. He got every question correct. - We knew it. - Yeah. Uh, and then at the end, particularly, Miguel, uh, talked about how-- I thought this was really poignant. He said, um, "There's houses and then there's homes. There's jobs and there's careers." He goes, "I might've been born in Mexico, but I'm an American in my heart." And he said, "That's why I served, that's why my grandfather served." And his uncles served in the military. It's nice and warm in this little huddle because it's really cold outside. But now we're all huddled in a little corner. And the first time I felt this warm in a little while. - Right. - But, Miguel, we're all praying for you and we're-- we-we really believe that it's time and that they're gonna come up with a positive decision. That's how we all feel. The veterans are all here for you and tons of people and press. You know, we're all waiting to hear the good news. Yes. So I just received a call from USCIS. They have a decision to render to Miguel and myself in person only. So they asked me to come down as soon as possible and I'm gonna go inside now, into the lockup, and we're gonna get the decision. God is in charge. Go in there and get the job done. God is in charge. Miguel Perez, Jr. Amen, amen, amen. ♪♪♪ Whenever you're ready, let me know. Um, okay. So, I was handed, uh, a decision by the two officers who interviewed Miguel today. Um, and it's said they were denying his citizenship based on a lack of good moral character. Uh, once again, the drug conviction. Uh, so I-I went and talked to Miguel and I gave him the bad news. Um, you know, he was disappointed, obviously. But he said, "I'm not giving up" or "We're gonna keep fighting." Just because you're born in Mexico doesn't make you a different kind of soldier. Your blood is shed for this country. This Constitution and this flag. And we're tired of the injustice. And we're gonna continue to fight. All they did was handed me an envelope with the decision and shook my hand and walked away. Maybe, this is their statement, like, "Hey, if we can do this to this guy, two-time military vet, you know, went to war, then nobody's safe, right?" So it's putting fear into the whole immigrant community. All right. Good afternoon, everybody. So, uh, I just got a, uh, email from-from the attorneys. USCIS has issued me an official, uh, appointment for, uh, citizenship. But Homeland Security would not let me cross to make it happen, so it's a-- it's a bunch of bullshit. So, uh, I think it's bullshit that our-our other veterans recently got denied. Um, most of these guys suffer from PTSD. They need to be treated over there. They need to see doctors. So, uh, we're not gonna give up. I'm a little-little pissed off but... It's all good. Uh, like we say, we may have lost the battle, uh, but we have-- but we haven't lost the war. Uh, you know, as it stands, the only way deported veterans can return home is when they die. And then Uncle Sam, uh, the US government, buries them, pays for their plot and their VA headstone.

Right now, he's-he's-- he's, like, in a little bubble right now with what--you know, his family being here and-and everybody. But as soon as you guys are-- you know, or everybody's gone, then you're in reality. You know, you-- you're down here by yourself. The good thing is, you got-- you know, you got the vets here. You got all of the supporters. But you're gonna have to face that "I may be here for the rest of my life." Just 20. Uh, you're 20? Yup. - Yeah. - And you're still-- you're still my little girl. Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm. Stop being potty mouth. You got--you got braces? Ooh. Did you brush your teeth? Okay. Okay. Yeah, I could tell. There's no bumper. It's so ghetto. Let me see your ears. Oh, nice. Oh, she misses everybody. ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ Tomorrow, I will find out about my citizenship. Regardless of the decision, we're gonna continue to do, uh, the advocacy and the work that we're doing. My name is Liliana Morales. My daddy is a deported veteran. My daddy is currently doing applications to come home right now. If maybe you guys could please help- help out my dad come back home, that would be great. And why do you want us-- why do you want me to get home, mama? Because you've been away for years and I don't want-- I don't just want us to just Skype. I want us to be together. One way or the other, ultimately, justice will prevail, and these veterans will come home. Uh, and the conversation about immigration in our country, uh, will change. This should not be a partisan issue. This should be an issue about doing right by those who have served this nation, by those who have defended us. We need to fix the system. We need to allow people who served this country, who put on her uniform and will say, "I'm willing to defend the Constitution of the United States from all enemies, foreign and domestic." And if they serve honorably, they do their tour, give them the citizenship, and then we wouldn't have this problem. The United States is a beautiful experiment. But it's not an experiment that is going to sustain itself. It's an experiment that it takes every single individual to protect, and no one knows better than veterans. Veterans understand this. And you're deporting United States veterans, honorable discharged veterans. You're deporting, you're kicking them out, your most loyal men and women, those who stood up for you, those who are broken inside because of their service? It ain't right. It might be lawful. Yeah, definitely, it's lawful. It's lawful to deport a United States veteran, but it's not just, and it's definitely not American. Hello, everybody. It's Hector Barajas here, and, uh, we have, uh, some really good news. Uh, I just missed, uh, a visit from one of my brothers that I served with. Uh, he was at Fort Bragg when I was in-- uh, stationed with the 82nd Airborne. Anyway, he-he did bring me something unique that we normally don't get, which is, uh, as you can see. You know, I actually was-- used to work at Taco Bell, so, Mexican pizza, uh, some chalupas and some quesadillas. Normally, we eat the, you know, the stuff that's out here. You know, there was never a single day in the Marine Corps if-if-if I had a mission that I would go back and say, "Hey, you know what? It was hard. I just decided to say, What the hell? I'm not gonna do it?" That's not what we do. Right? I mean, when you hit that wall and you're the first one to hit that wall and you crack it a little bit, but you don't get through, you know what you do? You come back and you-you-you-you reset, and you charge it harder. And so we've hit that wall for Hector and we broke through, and we got him a pardon. And we're gonna hit it to get him home and get him a citizenship, and I don't care how many times we've gotta hit it. We will keep hitting that damn wall until we get him home. And if he isn't successful in- in the initial court case, I wanna be there to tell him that. ♪♪♪ Oh. Deported Veterans Support House. Okay. All right. Well, that's--that sounds good. Whoo! God. It's killing me. ♪♪♪ So we got a decision. - Okay. - And we brought - you news. - Uh-hmm. And we've always said from the beginning - we never stop fighting-- - Exactly. Regardless of what we got. And so, um, as you look at it and read it, um, and you just got to know we-- - we're never gonna stop. - Sure. Definitely. So, uh, we're just gonna do a quick prayer. Yes. Thank you for this opportunity that I have today. Uh, the pardon was one of the biggest hurdles. Uh, just being able to go through this process, and re-regardless of what happens, we're gonna continue this fight. I ask you to please continue to take care of our families, our loved ones, and, uh, just-- I'm glad these people are here to-to be here for this decision. Um, again, thank you for this day, Lord. And I'll say, as a-- as a Marine, I've never seen an Army guy who fights like you, man. Right? We love you, brother. Yeah. And-and that is true. And without your leadership, uh, none of the progress would've been made. The legislation wouldn't have happened, pardons wouldn't have happened, and, uh, we wouldn't be here today. - So, um-- - Okay. Let's go ahead and let's get this over with. All right. So let's see what happens. Uh, hope for the best and expect the worst. Read it out loud. Uh, da-da-da-da-da. "Application copy, United States citizen-- Immigration Services thanks you for your interest in becoming a United States citizen. You must now appear--" Whoo! - You got it. - Woo-hoo-hoo. Congratulations, brother. April 13. April 13. You're coming home. My God. Oh, my God. Oh, wow. Okay, Hector. Congratulations. Fourteen years, man. Woo-hoo. Whew. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. And we'll keep fighting for your brothers. And I'm not stopping for any of you guys, because you're my commitment. Oh. Mom. I'm coming home, Mom. Bravo, bravo. Wow. This is great, man. Thank you. Oh, wow. Got a relative. - You deserve it. - I love you. I love you, Mom. All right. This is insane. It's never happened. They never had a Mexican deported-- who got deported back, to go home as a citizen. - It's the first. - Yes. - First of many. - Yeah. First of many. ♪♪♪ I'm like a shape. You know, nobody can know about me. I'm just a rumor. But I have to stay strong. And, you know, I'm gonna ask you this question, like-- and, like, just know that I don't-- I'm not coming from a place of judgment at all. I'm actually just curious to hear, like, what your-- what your thoughts on this are. So, there's a lot of veterans, a lot of deported veterans that, you know, don't end up joining the cartel. And they're trying to go back. They're trying to get home. Do you feel as though your work can give them a bad name? Well, no. I just feel sorry for them, you know, because... I don't think there's gonna be a way for any veteran to go back if they're-- if they already been deported. If I told you that there are veterans that are-- that are now-- just now being accepted to go back, what would your reaction be? Well, I don't know. You have to show me. Yeah, there are. There's the--there's-- We filmed with a guy. We actually filmed him getting, uh, getting the-- getting the response from the US government to get let back in as a citizen. And they give him-- uh, they give him, uh, the chance? Yeah. They giving him another chance. But if you think about- about knowing about this, you think they're gonna give me a chance? I don't know. That's not really for me to decide but, uh, I guess it's more about, like, do you feel as though the decisions that you've made now after being deported disqualify you from that? Well, I actually don't care anymore, I'll say that. I'm-I'm gonna stay here. ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ - Cha, cha, cha. - Cha, cha, cha. ♪ Happy Birthday to you ♪ ♪ Cha, cha, cha ♪ ♪ Happy birthday, dear Hector ♪ - What's your name again? - Hector. ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ - ♪ And many more ♪ - Yeah. ♪ And many more ♪ - Whoa. - Time to blow out the candles? - Oh, yeah. - Yeah.
