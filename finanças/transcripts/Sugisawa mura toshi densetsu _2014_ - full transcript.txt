"Have you heard about the urban legend of Sugisawa Village?" "From this point on..." "Yoshi: Aki, if something happens to me, take care of Hiroko." "Monday 8th, Yoshi" "Big brother" He'll be home soon! Sorry, did I startle you? Yes, well... no. It's fine. Hiro! You're not going to watch the rest? No, that's alright. - Is it better if I weren't here? - No. You can tell me how you really feel! No. I'm just not fond of scary things. Really? Neither am I. What are Yoshi and all of them thinking about? "The urban legend of Sugisawa Village" "The Urban Legend of Sugisawa Village" - Is the camera already rolling? - It's rolling. - Are you nervous? - Yeah, I am. What? Not like that! - Over here. - What's it called again? Sugi... Sugisawa Village! The first video of the urban legend of Sugisawa Village. Right, the first. Well it's a video project. - Alright, speak up. - Okay. This is the first film about the urban legend of Sugisawa Village. How nervous are you? We're going to take lots of videos. It's been a while since we've had a project like this, huh? - It's nice, feels good, yeah? - Wow, yeah. But we're headed somewhere that won't feel so good. Where is it that we're going this time? This time... here, it's this place. - When we find this... yeah. - We'll be going there? I'm going to take some photos. According to this, it should be here. But I'm not sure how credible this information is. You sure get self-conscious. I'm not used to this! I'm going to be filming like this the whole time! - Little by little, get used to it. - Okay. You've been filming this whole time, haven't you? Well, I mean, I've been holding the camera this whole time. Look at you! You love yourself! It's just funny watching Kawada run away from the camera. Instead of Sugisawa Village, it's become the main focus. No, the main focus is this! Not me. It's getting kind of strange... Is that something? A rock? What does this say? It's a rock, but what's with the money sitting on top of a broken dish? That's neat! There are three indentations. It kind of looks like a skull. - Deserted, wide, vacant land... - Wide, vacant land? Vacant land... like level grounds? Yeah, level ground. This place is super hilly and uneven. Super hilly and uneven. Not enough. Excuse me? "Spooky tales" "Sugisawa Village" "Is he still starving for blood?" "Wiped village off the map due to cruel murders." "The 37th video has been uploaded! Enjoy the latest video!" "Tragedy took place at 1:40 AM" "Gateway entrance to Shinto Shrine" "Floor of blood..." "Missing" "Fatal car accident near Sugisawa Village" "Frequent fatalities" You startled me. Yoshi... How long are you going to wear that? Hurry up and take it off. Don't stay silent, it's freaking me out. What the? Hiro. You woke up? Where's my brother? Yoshi said, "come here." - What? - Yoshi is in Sugisawa Village. - What's with you? - You've seen the website, right? - It's scary, so not really. - Same here. That reminds me, I received a mail stating that the newest video had been uploaded. Whenever a new video is uploaded I get a notification. Hiro, will you watch it with me? This is perfect. Take a photo. This is Sugisawa Village. At one time, a man went mad and massacred the whole village, leaving the land cursed. The village was abandoned and completely erased from maps. No one knows why. That's what we're here to find out. That's my line. It's the truth, right? Hurry up! Yeah, yeah. - Here I go. - Take more photos. Maybe this'll be my major debut. What's wrong? It's an unpleasant atmosphere. Isn't it? Isn't that what we're aiming for? Hey, Kohsuke! Get this! The old man who made flowers bloom! We might catch something that will have us rolling in coins. Here are the eyes... the mouth. It's a skull, right? - It can't be a skull. - Look Yoshio! Get a photo of this! All we're going to find here is glass. Surely we can find better elsewhere. Yoshio, get this! Isn't that the story where one gets greedy like the man next door? Oh, that fairy tale. I'd like to show this place to Yoshio's little sister. - Why would Hiroko want to come here? - Why not? - I can't find it. - What? Don't go further than this! You won't go home alive. Where did they come from? Good afternoon! Granny, do you live around here? Oh I see. Do you know if we're close to Sugisawa Village? What is this? Tomo? Who's Yoshi talking to? Where's the old lady? Mr. Honda? What is it? Hey, wait a second... What is that? Yoshio... Honda? What's going on? Honda! It's no use! I'm going to get killed. Open the door! What happened? What about Yoshio? Come on! Aki, I'm begging you... Go to Sugisawa Village with Hiroko! You need to go! If you don't... I'll be killed. I had so many chances to invite you out. Tons of people could just be gone. What are you talking about? I don't understand. You want Hiro to be gone? - Why? - If so, you and I... I'm the worst. I left Yoshio there. - Aki. - Yes? Aki! Aki! Don't you dare go! Aki! Aki! Honda? This isn't possible... Not enough... Not enough... Not enough... Not enough! Don't you dare go! Why? No way! I don't want to die! Have you heard the village's urban legend? Right! Oh, granny! Do you have any family with you or are there other villagers? I see. Same here, my sister and I live alone together. Can I follow you there? Granny, where is that village? I'd like to see it. Wait. Isn't that place abandoned? If you've got something to say, now's the time to say it. Once you arrive in Sugisawa Village, you may be saying farewell to your present life. - No, that's an exaggeration. - Say what you need to! I hate giving speeches. Sorry. My bad. What? The old lady is waiting, so let's go. - Let's go. - We're counting on you, Kohsuke! "Member's Card: Kohsuke Honda" Hiro, that's one of the landmarks. Yeah, there it is. Unbelievable. "Bridge of abandoned children" "Kusashige Tunnel" "Caution warning tape" Was there tape? Did we miss it? Did you take a wrong turn? - Should we go back the way we came? - Yeah. Hiro, you can wait at home. I'll be fine. Should I take a right? I think it's that street over there. On the left. Aki! Aki, stop! Hiro! - What's wrong? - My brother was standing there. - Did you really see him? - He was right there! That's strange, if he was really there, why is he gone now? It's weird! - Maybe you didn't see your brother. - I know I saw him! That's really strange. Hiro, let's go to the police! They won't believe us! That might be true, but still... Don't you want to save my brother? How can you call yourself his girlfriend? I want to save Yoshi too. "Aki, if something happens to me, I want you to look after Hiroko." And I want to protect you. I'm fine. I know that. Even so, no matter what, let's not get separated. How far does this go? What is it? Hiro! Everything's fine. Yeah. - Hiro? - What? Who is that? Big brother? Hiro, wait here. Don't move. Yoshi? Who are you? Answer me! Hiro! Run! Get out! Aki? Aki! Aki. Aki! Aki! Aki! Hiro, are you okay? I'm alright. You're hurt. This... I'm not hurt. You're not hurt? That's a relief. I'm sorry... Hiro? It's okay. - Hiro... are you okay? - Yeah. Hiro! - Hiro! - Aki, relax. Big brother! What are you doing here? Do you know where you are? Aki... Aki? Aki! Aki! Hiroko, this way. Are you okay? Don't worry about me, but we don't have much time. That's right. - We need to get Aki to the hospital. - No. You're the only one who can leave. No way! Sorry, this is all my fault. - But you have to listen to me. - No! You don't understand how dangerous this place is! What do you mean by this place? It's just an urban legend, right? - I still can't believe it myself. - What the heck is going on? I can't really remember. I can't just leave you two behind. If I do, I'll be alone. I'll go check on Aki. Hiroko... This might just be the start... Why can't I remember? Yoshio. You don't have anything you'd like to say before you go? Have you already forgotten? Shall I remind you? This... No way. Hiroko, she sure shut herself in, huh? Within an instant losing mom and dad in a car accident. That must be hard. I still don't understand. You and Hiroko made it on your own. But didn't you say it was about time that she started being more independent? I can help make that happen. Not yet. "To Hiroko" What is that? Aki. Aki. Aki! Big brother! Hiroko? Aki's already... Help me! I'm begging you! Leave her, we have to go! Hiroko! Hiroko! What's happening outside? Are you still alive? Hiroko! Get in the closet! The closet! Big brother... Big brother! Hiroko. Big brother! - How did you get here? - I found the map in Kohsuke's bag. - But that... - Kohsuke came to our house. Kohsuke did? - And I watched the video. - The video? By the gate, where you kept mentioning some old lady. What was that? How did that get... Who uploaded that? Hiroko. Brother, give that to that police. It's not as if there isn't anything on this. But it's better off having no one know. If that guy gets hold of it, that'll be the end of everything. What guy? Tomo, let's get out of here! We're leaving! This is crazy! It's great, no matter how much I watch it. What does that mean? Yoshi, we're leaving! Yoshio, let's leave! Let's take this, and upload it online. Is that why you brought us here? Of course. Besides, you guys are like him. There might be something buried, so you just keep digging and digging. Irresponsible men, aren't you? Where did you get that? I'm sorry. Let's go home. Yoshio? If you have something to say, then say it. I told you this will be your farewell to your current life. Hiro, don't listen to him. - Big brother... - Hiroko... Do you have any last words? While I hold him down, you get out of here! Look above. The gate should be after this. Sorry. - You'll come with me, right? - Run! Hiroko gets it. You jerk! Stop it! I don't have any family. Having your family taken away is horrible, isn't it? Hiroko! Your beloved Aki will be a ghost soon. Run! Hiroko, hurry up and go! Just go! You are... Hiroko? We have to go. Aki? - We're leaving! - Aki! Hiroko, we're leaving. Come on, Hiroko! Where is it? Save us! Welcome to Sugisawa Village. Big brother? I'm just a little tired. Big brother, you can leave with me, right? That's obvious, isn't it? What are you saying? Tell me the truth! Hiroko, how did you get here? By car, it's parked outside the tunnel. I see. Let's go. If we get past this, the tunnel should be there. Big brother? I'm sorry. Let's forget everything. To Hiroko, Yoshio is now a villager of Sugisawa. He can't leave alive. You may not believe this, but I'm stuck in and endless hell where dying daily is my destiny. But if you want to save Yoshi's soul, listen to the old woman. And bring a scapegoat. "Have you heard of the urban legend of Sugisawa Village?" - "Isn't it in some prefecture in Tohoku?" - "No, that's just a rumor." "An urban legend left as an urban legend." "I want to go!" "Up until recently some people were making videos about the village..." "The latest video was strange..." "Anyone know anything about it?" "I know where it is!" Not enough. Not enough.
