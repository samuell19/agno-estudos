Ooh My, my my... I said wake up, mama Can you hold my hand I said now wake up, mama I'm your man I love you, baby Can you hold my hand Said now wake up, mama Can you hold my hand Memphis, can you hold my hand? [AUDIENCE CHEERING] [UPBEAT SAXOPHONE MUSIC] Beale Street is a 24/7 party. It's the love of our life. We love Beale. Everywhere you go on Beale is love here. When you step off into one of the side streets onto Beale street, and you hear the music coming out of these places, and feel the energy associated with it. For me, it's home. The International Blues Challenge is important, because Memphis is a big blues and music city. I mean, we're very excited about all these blues men and ladies walking up and down the streets, and all that they have to offer, and I wanna wish everybody good luck. Everywhere you go it's blues playing. If you love blues... BOTH: This is the place to be. [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] [AUDIENCE CHEERING] [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] Y'all like the blues? The International Blues Challenge is the world's biggest blues competition. It's the opportunity for lesser known or unknown blues talent from around the world to find the international stage, and allow the international audience to find them. Each affiliated member of the Blues Foundation can send three acts. They can send a band, a solo, duo, and a youth act. We got a handful of acts from Italy, from Australia, almost 20 from Canada alone, Israel, Germany, the UK, the Republic of Korea is represented this year. We have 232 bands, solo, duo artists coming to Memphis from 17 different countries around the world. We have very detailed rules about how this competition works, and how we score and how we judge. The quarter-finals go for two nights, and every band plays twice, and they play each night in front of three judges, so it takes six judging scores to tell us who's moving to the next level. By the time we get to the semifinals, we have three judges in each of those panels, and we have five judges in each panel at the finals. Only 16 will make it to the final stage, and they're all looking to take home the gold JOE: Because really, if we're having fun on these stages then we're all gonna get something out of this, right? The most important thing that comes out of this event is boosting the career of the artists that come and compete, to see them grow and build their fan base, because of what started here on Beale street... I mean, that's an incredible feeling. [GUITAR MUSIC PLAYING] [VOCALIZING] JUSTINA: What was interesting for me, was just to come here and play, and have fun on stage, and share the music to the crowd, to the people here that wanna listen to good music. And coming here and finding out that there's a lot of promoters, there's a lot of record labels who could be good possibilities for me, I'm like, "Good, all in one package then.“ So good for me. Good for the band. Good for the product. Everybody's a winner. One, two, one, two, a one two, can I get an amen for that? One, two, one two, this is Bluzy Threesome live, coming to you, welcoming you to Croatia. We're coming to Memphis to you guys, 2020! [GUITAR MUSIC PLAYING] ANTONIJA: Yeah, it seemed very impossible at the beginning, because Croatia Blues Challenge was 25th of October, and we had like two and a half months to, you know, get the visas, get the money, and buy the tickets. It seemed pretty impossible, but somehow we managed to do it. BRANKO: So we came here to play to people from Memphis, because you will listen to blues, you know, and I just wanted to feel how it is to play - in front of people who really appreciate it. - ANTONIJA: Yeah. [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] JOHNNY: My father was killed when I was six years old. And then when I was 12-years-old, I was put in a wheelchair. [UPBEAT MUSIC] We all love to be around each other and playing music, and it's happy for us to be doing this together. It's really cool to be here with everybody that I idolize you know, to play on stages that they played on. All those years we made it But we were One of the groups who did I'm Nikki D, and we are the Sisters of Thunder, and this is our first IBC international blues challenge, and we are so excited. [ALL CHEERING] We are approaching? Beale street. - WOMAN: Beale street. - [ALL LAUGHING] Look at this sign, guys. WOMAN 2: Oh my God! [ALL CHEERING] NIKKI: We are here. We are excited. We're thankful. - ALL: Yeah. - Hopefully we win, and we don't have to work regular jobs no more. [ALL LAUGHING] Yeah, see that thing has to go. Too much too soon. [ALL LAUGHING] Keep on pushing me away SANDRA: There's places in the world, that just have like, there's something in the water, or something in the air that just creates like this powerful musical feeling and spirituality, and I think that's this place. You got me pushing Got me pushing instead We're coming to you, Memphis, - we can't wait. - Here we come. That was my biggest anxiety, but here we are in America. We have our very own American right here. [GUITAR MUSIC PLAYING] Here we go. Going to Memphis, Tennessee. Right, we are in Memphis. [VOCALIZING] Well, I think the blues found me. Yeah. I play music is to have fun, and the best way to have fun in a concert is having fun with the audience. [GUITAR PLAYING] MAN: Are you getting ready to vibe a little bit? I'll be singing in the weekend. How you feel about that? I feel pretty goddamn good. CAM: I met Damion at the same time I was trying to meet myself. Uh, if you could follow what I'm saying, I was still coming into myself as a musician. [HARMONICA PLAYING] DAMION: Like, I've been on Beale street up and down most of my life, and he'd already been playing, but we never met. And so with those chance encounters we met and the chemistry was there. [HARMONICA MUSIC] [UPBEAT MUSIC] On the road to Memphis I'm going to play the blues AKEEM: I'm a barber and own a barbershop, and currently in Arkansas. I did this so I can be able to kinda float when I need to do a show here and there. I ain't gotta kinda, you know, request off work or anything, and be my own boss. All of my American money for what I get out of there, which is kinda cool looking. [LAUGHS] While this train keeps a-rolling But my heart's still set on you It's very important for me to place and win in this challenge, because there's a lot riding on it for me. There's, you know, I've worked so hard. I've worked really, really hard, and you know, with the exception of friends and family I've done almost everything on my own, you know, and I've been wanting this for years. [GUITAR MUSIC] [UPBEAT MUSIC] JAMELL: If you take baby out and put Jesus, [LAUGHS] you got a gospel song. And if you take Jesus out and put baby, you got a blues song. [LAUGHING] Lord, I love you, Jesus Baby, I love you, baby That's it. Anybody can play the blues, but I think we know who own it. [LAUGHS] I own it, 'cause it's in my blood. It's in my DNA. [AUDIENCE CHEERING] You said you love me baby You did Please, call me on the phone some time MERCY: My father was McKinley Morganfield, whose nickname was Muddy Waters. My father was one of the founders of the blues. So Muddy Waters was best known for Chicago Blues, but he was known all over the world for being a blues legend. [BLUES MUSIC PLAYING] Please, call me on the phone sometime MERCY: The blues is a music genre founded by black men and women. Let's not mistake that. They came out of a tremendous struggle. The blues music is more than just music, it's American history, and it's American history as told by black people. And I don't want us to forget that that's where the blues came from. So when I speak about the blues, I'm not saying that it's something that belongs to black people. I'm saying let's not forget the historical significance of black people inside the blues. And you've got the nerve to say That you don't want me no more And you've got the nerve to say That you don't Want me no more I ain't studdin' you I tell you I ain't studdin' you If you gon think I'm gonna leave my woman Because of what somebody said, yeah You got to be crazy And out of your doggone head I ain't studdin' you BOBBY: I'm Bobby Rush, blues musician, just a old country boy who survived eight decades of the ups and down and the survival of life in U.S.A. as a blues man, not just a blues man, but as a black blues man. The work of the Blues Foundation was to keep the blues alive, and people who do the blue, people who love the blue, and people who makes the music try to help the young peoples, especially the young black men and women to keep them motivated. Now, blues is a traditional music. It goes back into the mists of time. It was music, it was created by very oppressed people, by African American people, and primarily in the South. They couldn't make money. They virtually could never own land. There was no American dream for them. You know you say you have money You better be sure Lord these hard times gonna kill you Not kidding Destroy your soul [HUMMING] I learned when I moved to Chicago, that blues is not sad music even if it covers sad subjects. I was told, you listen to the blues to get rid of the blues. Everybody have the blues. The blues is not always sad. The blues is not always happy. It's everyday living, the ups and the downs. It's also joyful. It's also angry. It's also extremely hopeful. It's also very funny. And it was poetry, and it expressed the human condition in a way that everybody in their audience could connect to it. They understood the feeling and the meaning of the person playing that song. The blues is all about telling your story, and that's what to me it's about, you know, telling your truth, your story. I think blues has the ability to change people's minds, and to move their souls. I wrote a song about Black Lives Matter, and I've been told the music is great, but the message is a bit strong. I think that a lot of people don't recognize that it was a message music. It was a story to be told about a way of life that was difficult. That was hard. That was challenging. That was defeating. The dark brown shades of my skin Or I add color to my tears Oh, oh Is it because I'm black Uh huh Somebody tell me what can I do Oh Lord Blues is a healing music, and if you don't talk about pain, you can't talk about healing. The blues is there to help heal that pain. - [AUDIENCE CHEERING] - JUSTINA: This is what I love about music. It connects everybody. Music is one, one body, one language, one connection. And that's why I love my job so much. [AUDIENCE CHEERING] Whisper in the mountain Just like a tease Open my eyes But I see nothing clear I'm from West Africa, Nigeria, precisely, and I grew up in one of the big ghettos, and slums in Lagos, it's called Ajegunle. That was where I was born and raised by my mother. I wanna know in this life of mine 'Cause I have a reason to be sure 'Cause I'm scared heavens got your heart So tell me baby My mom has been the most important person in my life, because she could have given up on me. Just give me to somebody else, or put me in the street, and somebody take me or I die, but she said never. In the rain, in the sun, she didn't care what she had to do to raise me. I wanna know in this life of mine 'Cause you're so far 'Cause I have a reason to be sure This cannot go on So tell me baby what are you gonna need When I'm gone I wanna know this for sure This is Nic Niedermann from Switzerland, my very good friend, a gift from God. He listened to my heart and brought out the light that I wanted to bring out, but I didn't know how to project it, so he tapped into it and connected with his gift and brought it to life. [VOCALIZING] Think about the good times Don't think of the sad times 'Cause we got now All we got is now I know that you're worrying But baby you will be fine So don't you give me your sad face Just give me your smile 'Cause you don't know You don't know Nobody knows What tomorrow may be Baby, you don't know You, nobody knows What tomorrow may be But you never know What tomorrow may be Yeah [AUDIENCE CHEERING] JOHNNY: This next song is an original song that I wrote with Brandon Logan. A story about my life. And it's true. Some people say What happened to me They say, it'll be okay, Johnny Wheels, just have hope And keep on believing By accident I went to a local swimming hole with a couple of friends of ours, and there had been a flood which changed the landscape, and I didn't check the depth of the water before I jumped in, and it was only three feet deep and I hit a sandbar. And so I guess the blues is just a natural feeling that's inside of me. This road nobody will travel everyday To me, the blues is a feeling that everybody gets, and it's usually associated with sadness, or trials and tribulations that aren't going exactly the way you want them to at the time, but by the end of the blues show, you feel a lot better knowing that there's other people that are going through the same thing you are. [UPBEAT HARMONICA MUSIC] [AUDIENCE CHEERING] [UPBEAT MUSIC] Well, my bandmates, they helped me get on and off every stage that we go to, especially Taylor, he's the one that always does the lifting. He lives with me, so we have that connection as well. He always sets up my harmonica, and my microphone for me. Brandon, our guitar player, he has cystic fibrosis, so singing for him is a huge deal as well. We're all messed up in our own way, but if you come together with people that you love and care about with a common goal, you can overcome all of that. [UPBEAT HARMONICA MUSIC] Every time I get on stage and play it, I'm on an even playing field, there's nothing else going on but music right there, and that's probably the biggest release I get from this situation. [UPBEAT MUSIC] But I believe in you All this time JOHNNY: One hundred percent when I play is the expression of the pain that I have, that I don't talk about, that I don't tell people about. That people probably don't even see. [HARMONICA MUSIC] [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] WILLIAM: Memphis is the crossroads of white and black Southern music. In the '60s, you began to see a music that really was birthed in Memphis of black and white musicians who were drawing from each other. You had these poor working class black and white kids, B.B. King... B.B. boogie darlin' The B.B. boogie baby Do the B.B. boogie If it takes you all night long WILLIAM: Elvis... Well, that's all right, mama That's all right for you That's all right, mama Just anyway you do it That's all right WILLIAM: all came to Memphis... and they all were aspiring musicians with not a penny to their name, and what they created was a music that was beyond race. So you have this powerful blurring of the lines between black and white music that happened in Memphis. [HARMONICA MUSIC] DAMION: My grandfather was a sharecropper. And then his era, the '50s... '40s, '50s, '60s, not everyone in the fields, they had their music. From the elders I get a lot of, it reminds them of their youth, so I feel honored that I can be a part of that. [HARMONICA MUSIC] CAM: My father's name is Kenny Malone Kimbrough, and my grandfather's name is David Junior Kimbrough. And my grandfather was a pioneer in a style, specific style of music called cotton patch soul blues. And it originated only out of North Mississippi, also at the same time, a style of music called hill country blues, and so he was a pioneer in that style. Well, I'm sorry I'm sorry right now please Oh darling I love you so bad [UPBEAT GUITAR MUSIC] I'm gonna love you, baby I'm gonna do you right I'm gonna love, honey I'm gonna take my time My grandfather's legacy, and the heritage of my family has taken me all over the world and I've met people... It's a lifelong connection, and so it's definitely like a way of life. I found I found love DAMION: We practice for the vibe, and not necessarily practice for the song. As long as we like, yeah, like if we go to practice and we kinda like, ah... we know we need some work, if we like not really feeling it. But if we practice and we feeling it, it's like, yeah, I started doing it 'cause it feel good. DAMION: Just like a baby's cw is universal, you know, you hear a baby cry and you're gonna look and see what's going on. The blues is kinda like that, it's something universal. [UPBEAT HARMONICA MUSIC] FELIX: To me, blues music is a feeling, a music that comes from the heart, from the soul. And my first influences in music was Rockabilly music. [GUITAR MUSIC] [PEPPY MUSIC] [VOCALIZING] [AUDIENCE CHEERING] [UPBEAT MUSIC] We are nothing without the audience. This music we play, and especially this old blues, it's not an easy listening music, So you have to attract them to your show. [GUITAR MUSIC] [AUDIENCE CHEERING] The blues has been recorded for about a 100 years now, and for around the first 50 years of that, the primary audience for blues was black Americans. It was recorded as singles. The only place it got on the radio was black oriented radio stations. And then starting in the late 1950s, and into the 1960s, a lot of white people like myself discovered that the blues existed. We fell in love with the music, and there grew a very large white audience. So that audience which are now in too many cases literally gray beards, became a core audience for the blues, so white audiences found this music, and black audiences tended to move on. And from that time on the white audience, and the blues began to just expand exponentially, and the black audience began to shrink. I don't know exactly did black people turn away from the blues, or did the blues turn less black? So for example, Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Eric Clapton, the guys who were always at our house, they embraced the blues. And it appears that when one group embraces the blues it becomes uncool to the other group. What we see in the '60s is yet another generational change, except that the new generation includes a lot of white kids like me who were angry, protesting Vietnam and racism, and they turn to the blues as a way of building a bridge over troubled waters. The blues is a live form. It's a living form. It's meant to be heard, and yes, recorded music is wonderful, and it's great to bring it home, and get to know the music, but there's something special about being in the club. A lot of young people have gotten away from the whole appreciation of live music. It's an experience. It's not just, "Oh, I'm listening to something." It's an experience. [UPBEAT MUSIC] This is an original song about what's happening. We come from Ohio My family and me Singing down the blues Here in Tennessee We're a family based group, three sisters, niece, and nephew, and two cousins, and so the legacy of our parents, all of our parents, my niece, her dad was a singer. My dad was considered the James Brown of Gospel. WOMAN: Yes. We was always singing Gospel, but he knew how to drop that mic, and bring it back up, and so I was always in awe of my dad and my parents. And so this means legacy for us. We had it hard through the storms of life From injustice to our civil rights But I feel like just saying it like this. I said ooh Ooh, we We made it We made it This would mean so much to our musical career, because we do love what we do. It's hard sometimes, because we are family, and we're not always received everywhere, so we kinda try to figure out what's best to do and sing. But it's so rewarding to be able to do this with the ones that I love. Yes, I love it. Yeah, and I do love them. - Yes. - [ALL LAUGHING] She give us these kinda kisses. [KISSING] [ALL LAUGHING] [UPBEAT MUSIC] We made it We made it NIKKI: Music is the universal language. All ages, of nationality, and it's like, oh my God, it's just so good to sing, but coming together here at this blues, yes. ALL: Yes. [UPBEAT MUSIC] [SHOUTS INDISTINCTLY] [FUNKY INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] AKEEM: Y'all ready? Stevie Ray Vaughan said it's flooding in Texas George Strait said that's where you can find those exes B.B. King said the thrill is gone Michael Jackson said thrill is on I like it I like it on If you don't give me no country, no blues, No rock, no pop Go pack my guitar I give honor unto all the old blues, and then just make it my own. I call it new blues, old blues with a new sound. I wanna keep the traditional blues, but make it millennial. Albert King born under a bad sign Floyd Taylor said she ain't mine I like her I started in the church at 13, so I've been playing. I feel like I've been playing there a long time. I still play there every Sunday. If you don't give me no country, no blues no rock, no pop The International Blues Challenge is very important. It's a big deal. There's a lot of major people here. There's a lot of sponsors, a lot of people from record labels, a lot of venue owners, managers, booking scout, al... everything, Everybody's here. On the road to Memphis I'm gonna play the blues On the road to Memphis I'm gonna play the blues You know I gotta get to Memphis 'Cause I got to pay my dues I mean, you know, you can listen to an old blues song, and you might not recognize what you're talking about, 'cause it was sung back in the '60s. Everything that you listen to that we put out, it's gonna be today's situation. [GUITAR MUSIC] For the world now the blues is a common cultural touchstone. Over the last 50 years, more and more people have begun performing blues, so the blues has become part of the world musical vocabulary. And hopefully, they're singing songs that are representative of their lives, not the lives of fictional people that they're attempting to channel if you like. I can remember when they made "waw waw..." [WAW WAW SOUND EFFECT PLAYING] So the white guy could sound like the black guys. Now you've got black guys buying waw waw to sound like a white guy who trying to sound black. [CYMBALS MUSIC] When I see you pushing Yeah, you're pushing on my pride And I'm not used to the way in Anyone to come over my side baby And I I will call you when I need you When I hear the word blues, I usually think of raw emotion. Raw is the best word I can think of, and that's the music I love. I see you even as you're telling all your lies I see the room is glowing deep inside your eyes And I think you know the truth baby Oh, you've been telling how to be alive And I'm the one chasing you Ooh And if you gave me half the chance I would show you Oh, that I could really lay it too Oh, let me show you Come on, baby - [UPBEAT MUSIC] - [AUDIENCE CHEERING] I've never identified as a blues artist, partly because I was a little hesitant. I didn't wanna be appropriating, because of what it came from. You know, it was born of suffering, and the African-American experience. I think that's why people feel it. At the same time like, it's just a natural form of musical communication for me. Oh, watching, watching you Watching, watching you watching me Yeah, eh, ey, yeah, oh, ooh [AUDIENCE CHEERING] I don't think that I could be in music without, um, well, without drinking and drugs. Everybody talks about music being raw and emotive, and it's a scary thing a lot of the time to talk about those emotions, and to sing about those emotions, and you feel really bare. And so I think I just needed to... to kind of numb myself before I could share that. But I also think I needed to numb myself before I could write about it. I still do have fear sometimes that I can't write without being drunk or high, and yet like I keep writing. And it's just that liar on your shoulder saying that you can't do it, you know, but... but you can, You just have to do it. [CHUCKLES] It's not the trouble then I might Having gone too many years To know it is the time And still my reputation... [CHUCKLES] I forgot the words. [ALL LAUGHING] I was over-thinking it. [LAUGHS] I was down with you Behind this hotel door I think the intimate nature of the blues you say I have the blues when you're upset, it's all a communication of what that, like the speaker or the artist is going through. If all If all I had to do I wanted to keep myself from Oh, from loving anybody baby Anybody at all, ooh, ooh [VOCALIZING] I jump out of bed Yes, and I would run across that floor And I would leave all of my love Behind that hotel door [VOCALIZING] [AUDIENCE CHEERING] [UPBEAT MUSIC] MAN: I think that blues music is a pure field, you know, you can't fake it. You can't go around it. You either feel it, or you don't feel it, you know? So when you feel it, it is good, when you don't feel it, it's not blues anymore. The most important thing is to make music, - and to share it with the people. - MAN: Yeah. I'm smoking my cigarette Slowly Waiting for the dawn to come To scare away that ghost A ghost of my memories But you are haunting me Yeah, you been You've been haunting me for damn too long [AUDIENCE CHEERING AND WHISTLING] Ooh I believe that everybody who had the chance to be here is the winner in a way, you know, because it's not about winning the prize, it's just to be surrounded with the people that really love the music that you love, - and that's awesome feeling. - MAN: Yeah. So if I could move tomorrow here and play and live, - I'm... I'm here tomorrow. - Yeah... I gonna live here. I'm moving here to Memphis. I don't wanna go back to Croatia. [LAUGHS] [UPBEAT MUSIC] [AUDIENCE CHEERING] [VOCALIZING] [VOCALIZING] [UPBEAT MUSIC] I think the blues actually covers all types of music, so country has the blues. Hip hop has the blues. Jazz has the blues. I listen to like Hendrix, and the Beatles, and you know the Beach Boys, all of these artists, and I found out they were inspired by artists from the '40s, and the '30s, and the '20s. It's authentic. It's real and it's honest, you know, and you can do it with just a guitar. While this train keeps a-rolling But my heart's still set on you And it's just one of those old kind of slow drive by songs. While this train keeps a-rolling But my heart's still set on you I don't know, maybe it's being a musician that makes me like the blues, or maybe it's the blues that makes me wanna be a musician. I don't... I can't really tell, you know. Girl I'm leaving in the morning Tell me what in the world I'm gonna do [GUITAR MUSIC] That kinda sound. [CHUCKLES] [GUITAR MUSIC] Now you don't get to have me baby It's okay if you don't stay That's all right, sweet baby I'm gonna leave you any way Goddamn You have to treat blues, songwriting delicately, because it's been done before, and you have to find a way to not tread on other people's shoes whilst you're writing. And you've gotta make it sound unique again, whilst following like a pattern that's been done. So with ragtime music, you... you've gotta train the brain to do the rhythm, and the melody at two different times, so you'll start... [GUITAR MUSIC] by playing a baseline, and then the melody comes on top. It's sounds happy doing it. [GUITAR MUSIC] So here's the second technique I use when I'm playing. Um, I jostle between both the Piedmont blues sound and an old Delta blues sound that you get from artists like Robert Johnson, and Skip James and sort of artists like that, - which is more... - [GUITAR MUSIC] that original sound. And then I like to put a lot of, uh, lead playing over the top, like B.B. King, so it kind of... [GUITAR MUSIC] Which is that kind of B.B. King Sound. [BASS GUITAR MUSIC] The blues is exactly what we need to carry us forward where we are going through treacherous waters that are uncharted. We need connection desperately now. You know what, I... I find it in the music. I have always found it in the music. I always say music helped in segregation, [LAUGHS] Because nobody cared about what color anyone was. They just wanted to dance and enjoy the music. The magic of the blues is that even people who don't understand all the words can feel this, can feel what we call the tension and the release. And that's the way that blues is magical in a way I don't think any other music is. It's a music that can always be depended on to tell the truth. JAMELL: I like to dedicate this song to my mama tonight. My mother passed away on Christmas morning, and coming to the obvious, it has been real hard for me, but... I thank you guys for helping me get through the night, all right? [AUDIENCE CHEERING] I got fire Found a better way, baby My mom was a brilliant woman. I really don't like to use the word “was," but last year I felt her with here, with me. She passed away on Christmas morning. Urn, wasn't expected, so it was kind of like, you know, still learning how to cope with it. And I thank you for giving up to me. - [AUDIENCE CHEERING] - For 31 years. I was kinda expecting her to be here. You know, see me through this journey as well. I didn't know what the blues really, really was until Christmas morning. I've gotta find a Find another way, baby To show you that I care About you, uh Oh! Uh You mean more Oh, more to me You make my heart complete, baby When my mom was in the audience, you can hear her screaming over everybody. She would wait till it get real quiet just to, "That's my baby.“ - And I'm like, "Oh my God.“ -[MAN [LAUGHING] To tell you that I love you Music started for me at an early age. Somewhere around two years old in church. When I'd come up, the blues was, you know, it was the devil's music. Well, I was on the tail end of that era, but that was the devil's music, so you really couldn't listen. Well, you wasn't supposed to listen to it. [VOCALIZING] If you only knew How much I care Oh! Oh! It can be kind of discouraging to not really see as many African-Americans doing blues, so I would like to see more, you know, African-Americans coming back to our region, yeah. [UPBEAT MUSIC] And it's just something that you walk with. Something that you live with. Something you eat with, you talk with, you sleep, it's just in you. I like to bring fun to the blues when I'm on stage. [UPBEAT MUSIC] [AUDIENCE CHEERING] Our judging system is run through an award platform, and it's set up with every band, every solo duo artist is judged on a score of one to 10. And then the judging is weighted based on, it's a four time weight for blues content. It's a three time weight for originality. It's a two time weight for musicianship. So based on what the values are that we see as most important. For the last two years, we've been able to go to a digital platform, log our judges in, and they basically have our score sheet digitally on their phone, and they're able to use that to score the acts this year. Once all the scores are in, we can then go through, and start making the tabulations in each one of the venues. BARBARA: After two days of quarter final performances, 80 challengers survive, and move to the semi-final competition. JOE: But everybody's been waiting for this moment, right?

I'm gonna continue doing what I've been doing, booking shows, traveling all over the world internationally and nationally. Doing what I do best. Performing, loving life, loving people. You know, this year, when I didn't make the finals, after making the finals, three years ago, you know, it's a little heartbreaking, but I gotta keep on moving on up no matter what it is. BARBARA: Out of those 80 competitors, 64 will be eliminated in the semifinal round. The remaining 16 challengers compete on the Orpheum stage for the coveted top honors as the best blues band, and the best blue solo duo. [UPBEAT MUSIC] You know, we didn't make it past the semi-finals, but we couldn't have done anything different. I wouldn't have done anything different, so that's important knowing that I kinda did my best, and I gave it my all. My band gave it their all. I must admit, the saddest day was about not advancing past the semi-finals was when we walked into the Orpheum theater. Man, that is a gorgeous space, like, whoo! I would've loved to play there. - So we made it to the semi-finals. - Yeah! That was exciting, and we met so many cool people and great bands. I think a highlight for us was just hugging it up a little bit with Bobby Rush, and get some advice from him. That was my first time actually competing in the IBC, and it's definitely a memory, man. It gave Damian and I something to look forward to for our future. We was able to rub elbows with a lot of different people. Hopefully, getting to a city near you soon. For real. So I gotta say that this experience really did boost our confidence. We came to Memphis with zero expectations, and came home as IBC semifinalists. We wish to inspire all of the kids that has this kind of dreams. Just set your mind to it, and do it with all your heart, and it will come to you possibly when you least expect it. We came to the semifinal, and the experience has been something that has motivated me in so many... way in believing in what I'm doing with music. That experience I would hold forever and cherish forever. When we did not make the finals... [LAUGHS] Made the semi-finals didn't make the final, that walk was probably the longest walk ever, the longest walk of shame. Well, we were blessed to be able to go to semi-finals, so we thankful about that. [BLUES MUSIC PLAYING] Say now wake up mama Can you hold my hand MOJO: Memphis, can you hold my hand?
