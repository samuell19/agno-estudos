SuomiFilmi presents: - A tale of a witch's love The White Reindeer Starring: Writers: Director and cinematographer: Music: Sound: Art Director: Production lead: A child is born to a fiery snow... Grew a girl with hay shoes... Like a young reindeer doe... Didn't know at her father's home... When she went to her bridegroom's house... That she was born a witch... An evil spirit in her stomach. Sacrificed at the altar of Kermikkä... a white reindeer doe... From there she ran as a mountain reindeer... Until the moment was at hand... A lightning impaled the white... There lay the girl with the hay shoes... The snowblanket as her cover and a pillow made of snow under her head. Hey, Pirita, will you come with us? Look at that! Hey-oop! Go, reindeer! Make way! Let me through! Go, go! Overtake! Gallop, gallop! A reindeer is fast, but a wolf is faster. Got you! Will you be mine? Looks like a hunter of she-bears is coming. We have a merchant and you have a bird. Sell her to us. Are you serious? Yes I am. You can't treat our daughter badly. I'll do my best. A great acknowledgement on behalf of the bride and the bridegroom to you who gave a present to this honorary table. Heads together... like frogs. Hello to all the wedding guests... ...and to the memory of the young couple. There is no more booze. The bread and the salt are eaten. Kosha! Go after the reindeer! Kosha! Kosha! Aslak! Pirita! Hey! Pirita! Hey! I'll leave this to you as a house reindeer. It'll grow up to be a beautiful draft animal. Thank you. Again you leave and who knows when you'll be back. I'll miss you. The weeks'll go by fast. Goodbye, my bird. Come back soon! Hello. I knew you'd come. Love potion? So a love potion eh? That's what the young women, and the older ones too, want. A man of the mountains... nu-nu-nuu Well, Tsalkku-Nilla knows how to do it Herbs from beyond ten mountains, from the streams of ten creeks lö-lö-lö-löö... A little bit of death mold, lä-lä-lä-lää... The testicles of ten deer. Nu-nu-nu-nuu... The strength of ten deer! Nu-nu-nu-nuu... Tsalkku-Nilla is such a seer that he brings the lost reindeer back home too. Tsalkku-Nilla is a great seer, brings the dead back from their graves too. You must sacrifice to the great altar the first living thing that you encounter on your way home. Then can no man resist you. Yet this winter you... you... Continue! You must sacrifice to the great altar the first living thing... Living thing... Pirita, hey! Catch! I missed you and came to visit home. The first living thing... Good day. Where is Aslak? I want to see him. He should be over there at the resting point. Aslak has a fine-looking woman. You bet. Aslak left with Tauno to hunt reindeer (almaa hiihtämään). Found fresh tracks from the Pais mountain. Stay here for the night, he may come back soon. Then no man can resist you... A wild reindeer. Don't! It's white. Let's catch it. I can catch it. Shafi, stay! How'd it happen? There's something odd about this. Niilo left to chase a wild white reindeer. We found him At Paha Kuru... ...In this condition. Where are you going? I'll go to Pais mountain to cut some lichen. Come with me! Don't play jokes with me. Will you say hi to Aslak for me? I'll do that. It couldn't have been anything else than that white witch reindeer. That's your local superstition. A reindeer can't kill a man like that. That's the second man found dead at Paha Kuru. There were clearly reindeer tracks in the body and there were no other tracks. Yeah, and Jouni went after a reindeer too. It's no ordinary reindeer. It's bewitched! You won't make me believe that. Witchcraft won't help if it gets in my sight! Bullets won't hurt it, you need cold iron. You need to kill it with a spear. Spear you say? I'll rely on my rifle if that witch attacks me. Forest caretaker shouldn't make fun of a witch. It can become angry. A lot happens here that you can't understand in the south. What's wrong with Virkku? And now I'll show how I kill a witch! What's that animal over there? I shot it... Something's happened. Woman... laughing... I shot it... Laughing... It laughs... It laughs... I shot it but it keeps on laughing... (We paid 15 000 for it) (Yeah, I paid fifteen thousand) (It was nice, good) (After a week it dropped its horns) Witch! Witch! Witch! The white reindeer! Reindeer! Witch! Reindeer! She's a witch! Let me go! Hey, let's go home. What's wrong with you? What has happened to you? Are you ill? I'm afraid, you mustn't go after the white reindeer. Promise me! Promise me. I don't want to lose you. Calm down. I'm not going anywhere. A shame that the white reindeer got away. Wonder if a wolf caught it on the mountain. What are you looking at? Is it wrong if I look? Haven't seen you in a long time. It's best that you go to bed now. I'll have to go soon too. Pirita! I saw... a horrible dream. Did I scare you? I'm afraid to sleep. Look at the moon glare. Some evil eye must have been watching you. Sleep, my bird. ...and so hugs my soul, as in Jerusalem. It's good to go there Jesus went ahead. When can I go there to be in peace? From these bonds of a madman. Sorrow fills the mind even though the night ends in a certain destiny. ...I am snow white No, no! Don't go! No, no! Don't go, don't go! Don't go! Don't go! It's a witches' coven! The white reindeer! The white reindeer! Why are you forging a spear? You can only kill a witch with cold iron. The white reindeer! Tsalkku-Nilla! Tsalkku-N... Tsalkku-Nilla! Tsalkku! Altar, altar, altar, altar Altar, altar, altar, altar Altar, altar, altar, altar The powerful spirit of the altar Take back the spell, release me from witchcraft! Hear me! Hear! Release me! Release! Release me! Release...
