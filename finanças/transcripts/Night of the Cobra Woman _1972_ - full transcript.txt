(bats screeching) (curious music) (suspenseful music) - [Francisca] Lena, I'm tired. How much further do we have to go? - [Lena] Well we've come this far. - [Francisca] We've really got enough herbs here, I don't know why you want that one so badly. - I told. - Lena, look. Isn't that the gypsum root you've been looking for? - [Lena] Yes. It's supposed to be the herb of long life. - [Francisca] I don't believe it. - At least it'll give us energy. We'll be able to work a lot longer. - Lena, we've been away from camp so long we'll have to work till midnight to make up the time. - Don't tell me you've haven't enjoyed being with me. - It's just that I'm afraid of the Japanese. - [Lena] To hell with the Japanese. Look what's in here. - I'd rather not. I'm afraid. (suspenseful music) - Um, okay, stay out there then. - Yes, I better keep a lookout. (suspenseful music) (snake hissing) (Lena screaming) (suspenseful music) (woman muffled groaning) (lena crying out) (suspenseful music) (gentle music) (gun firing) (soft music) (woman groaning) - There are 15 to 20 active enzymes in this sample of venom, but we only know what about the five of them do once they are injected into a snake's victim. The effect of the rest of them is still completely unknown. - Does the anger of the snake have anything to do with the death of the victim or is it just chemical nature of the venom? - That's a good question. You see, it was a theory held by the ancients that death came from the anger of the snake. Do you remember what Cleopatra said when she applied the asp to her breast? With thy sharp teeth this knot of life intrinsicate at once untie, poor venomous fool be angry, and dispatch. Kindly pass this around. We must allow for the possibility that the emotional state of the snake influences the composition of the venom. Probably the fear or the anger the snake feels causes the release of certain enzymes which make the venom fatal. The ancients, as you see, always have their point. All right, let's take a break for lunch. This afternoon I'll discuss with each of you your individual antivenom research projects. - I wanna study venom of that firebrand cobra that you spoke about yesterday. - You must've misunderstood me dear. That snake is probably extinct, if it ever existed at all. Possibly-- - Yes, but you even gave me the name of a woman in the hills who has one. I even wrote it down. Here it is. Lena Aruza, Vista del Sol in Antipolo. - That was during the war something, like 25, 27 years ago. People in that area have spread some stories about it but I'm not sure-- - I was so interested in it that I read up more. You know they say that once bitten by the firebrand cobra it can possess your very soul, that the action of the venom in your blood stream keeps you always young. - [Doctor] And you believe all that superstition? - No. - You know, there are some very interesting coral snakes to be found somewhere along the bay. - How do I get to Antipolo? (horn sounding) (gentle music) Hello. (speaking foreign language) (curious music) - What do you want? - Hello, I came here to see Lena Aruza. - I'm sorry, Miss Aruza sees no one. - Well, I'd like her to tell me that. Please tell her that she has a visitor who came all the way up from Manila. - Miss Aruza is in meditation and she's given strict orders not to be disturbed. - Well I'll wait if that's all right. - As you wish. But I cannot ask you inside the house. I'll be glad to wait out here, thank you. - As you wish. (curious music) (suspenseful music) (Joanna screaming) (Lope giggling) - Lope, stop. Leave her alone. (playful music) (kids chattering) - [Announcer] Flight Jet 52 now arriving at Gate 14. - Hey. Hi, going into Manila? - Yeah, we are. Any particular place you're gonna go? - Well a couple of buddies of mine are supposed to be holding a room for me at the Hotel Aurelio. - Hon, do you know where that is? - I know where it is. - Well now get in. - They were supposed to pick me up but I don't know what happened to them, you know? - Oh, that's too bad. - Planning to buy some weed down here? I hear they got some pretty good weed around. - No, I'm not really into that. I just came to keep my little girl company. She gets a bit scared of the boogeyman at night. You understand? - Oh yeah. You live down here? - Just for a while. I'm doing field research for UNICEF developing anti-venom. - Anti-venom. - Yes. It's a vaccination for snakebite. - Snakes. Listen man, call if the little lady's busy at the lab maybe you and I can kill some time together. - Okay, fine, I'll do that. (suspenseful music) Hey, wait a second. - [Joanna] I can get used to him after a while as long as he doesn't take you with me too much. - [Duff] No, he won't. Eagles don't require too much attention. He won't take up any more time than Stub did. Hey, did I ever tell you about Stub? - I thought Stub was your horse. - No, Stub was my eagle. Yeah, five years anyway. He's a really good bird. He really knew me well. We went hunting together and shit on my arm. Yeah, he was a good bird. Well anyway this one here he looks just like Stub did. - I think Dirk would be a really good name for him. - Dirk? - Mm-hmm. - Yeah, well it's not bad I guess. - Well anyway you'll have somebody to play with while I'm at the lab. - Wait a minute, chicken, you're gonna leave me all alone in a strange room, in a strange city, just after I got here? I think I'm gonna go see that snake lady while you're at the lab. - Don't you want to see the town first before you go running off into the jungle? - Well to tell you the truth I'm kind of more interested in seeing the snake lady and the Hunchback of Notre Dame or whatever was you were talking about on the phone. (gentle music) - Okay, but just be careful. - Sure will. And you do me one favor will ya? You take good care of DirK in case I don't get back. Do you know if there's a woman who lives around here in the hill someplace, a snake lady? - Up that way. - Up that way? (speaking foreign language) (suspenseful music) (Duff groaning) (suspenseful music) - [Lena] Movini. - Help me, please, help me. (playful music) - How do you feel? - Confused. I was bitten by a snake. What happened? - The venom was taken out of your body. - Where am I now? - You're at Lena's house. - Lena? Is that the woman I saw in the forest. - Yes. - Well who was that guy at the window. - [Francisca] That's Lope, my son. - He looked older than you. - Did he frighten you. - Yeah, he shook me up a little bit. - He used to be very handsome. - [Duff] What happened? - He made love to Lena and his body begun to erode. - Hey does Joanna know I'm here? - [Francisca] Joanna? - Jesus, she's probably worried sick. - Tell me where she is and I'll go see her this afternoon. - Well she's at the Tropicana Apartments room 404. - 404, all right. - You know I really appreciate this a lot miss uh? - Francisca. - Miss Francisca. - Oh and one more thing. Could you ask Joanna to bring Dirk here to keep me company. - Dirk? - He's my eagle. (suspenseful music) - Take care Lope. I'll have to go away for a while but I'll be back soon with a bird. A very big bird. Big enough to destroy Movini. And Lena's power will soon end. - Hi. (Lope whimpering) It's all right. Jesus, can't you speak? Eating? Well look, you might find it easier with this. It's all right just, go ahead. Go ahead, come on. You, uh... Where's Lena? (dramatic music) (suspenseful music) (gentle music) - Who told you to come in here? - [Duff] Did I startle you? Shouldn't I be here? That guy out there, he told me it'd be okay if I came inside. - I prefer to be alone when I milk Movini. - Well I'm sorry. - I'm sorry about what happened, I really am. - Don't worry about it. It was an experience. - He's usually very well behaved. - Is he like a pet. - He's more of a companion. - Companion? Wouldn't it be safer if he were defanged? - That's horrible. Defanging a snake is like castrating a man. His very essence is in his venom. It's the substance that enables him to live. To kill his prey. To survive. - You sure he's still not dangerous. - Movini's been with me a long, long time. Any friend of mine has nothing to fear from him. - Isn't that venom poisonous. - Venom has many, many properties. Carefully administered it can act as a fertilizer. (gentle music) (suspenseful music) - You better go in there alone. I'll stay out here with Dirk. - Who are you? - Are you Lena Aruza? - Yes. - My name is Joanna. I'm looking for a friend of mine. He's an American guy, his name is Duff. He came up this way and I haven't seen him since. - He was bitten by a cobra. He's been recovering. We would have notified you but he didn't tell us about you. - He didn't. - No. - Well who's been taking care of him? - I have, I'm a trained nurse. - [Joanna] Is he all right, I'd like to see him now. - He's fine, he's sleeping. He just needs rest. - [Joanna] Look, I came all the way up from the city. I'd like to see him. - There's an inn down the road. Perhaps you could stay there until morning. - Thank you very much for taking such good care of Duff. I wish you could be a bit more courteous with me. Will you please make sure to tell him that I was here. (Joanna screaming) - Movini. (suspenseful music) He seems disturbed about something. - [Joanna] He's a beautiful snake. Is that a firebrand cobra. - You'd better go. Visitors disturb him, that's how Duff got bitten. - If you say so. - The venom. (suspenseful music) Crafty little bitch. (gentle music) She'll get her venom. - Look what I got. - Does she know? - Nope. I grabbed it when she was out of the room. - [Francisca] Good. - I just don't like Duff not knowing. - Don't worry, I'll tell him you were here to see him. Watch out! (Francisca groaning) (Joanna whimpering) (suspenseful music) (dramatic music) (suspenseful music) - Doctor, I've really hit the jackpot with this venom. This cell is dividing more rapidly than anything I've ever seen. - This spectrographic composition shows that an unknown amino acid is present in the tissue. And the fact that it has remained unharmed by the other essence and enzymes in the venom means that this living compound here is virtually indestructible. - Well then what would be the effect on its victim once it was in the bloodstream. - You mean what effect does it have on your boyfriend? That's what you're really concerned about, isn't it? (Lope crying) - Lope. What happened? Did Movini? I'm sorry. Where's Lena? (suspenseful music) - Well I just hope this is a proper amount of venom. I'm sure that's an important factor in determining the effect it has. Injecting the venom now. - We're ready now with Mitzy, doctor. - I'm getting primary reactions now. Heart and respiration is speeding up. Basic functions are very erratic. - I think she's dying, Doctor. - [Doctor] We're getting a very high nerve impulse reading. - Yes, but don't the nerve impulses continue even after the heart has stopped? - Not in cobra victims. Neurotoxin breaks down their transmissions first. It's one of the first things to go. - Look, Doctor. (curious music) - I exorcize thee serpent. I command thee to appear before me under a beautiful and well favored human form of soul and body, and to fulfill my wishes. Incline to me thy power and enable me to succeed in this great enterprise. - [Duff] Lena. - Duff, I thought you'd left. - [Duff] Left? Now why should I have left? - Your girlfriend was here, I thought you'd left with her. - [Duff] You mean Joanna. - She brought an eagle up here, Duff. It killed Movini. - I know, that was my eagle. I just found him in the mango grove. He was poisoned. - Poisoned, they were all poisoned. That's what the mangoes were for, to protect Movini from the birds. - What about Francisca? She's dead too. She's at your house, there's venom coming out of her neck. What about that? - Duff, you'll understand shortly. Something's going to happen to me. Maybe you can prevent it, if you hold me. (gentle music) - Yeah, I can hold you. - You'll be safe I promise you. Do you think you could love me? - You're quite a girl. I don't know where you get the energy to work all night after that whole experience in Antipol. - I think we should be getting back to Mitzy. She is far more interesting than I am right now. And anyway, a good deal livelier since you gave her that venom injection. - Yeah. - Mitzy, poor Mitzy. What happened to her? (suspenseful music) - I don't understand. Must be some kind of a reaction to the venom. - What does this mean? (suspenseful music) - I've sucked the years out of your body. - It was the only way I could be a human and a woman again. - But you told me I could trust you. - Movini was taking over my body. I was becoming Movini. Don't you understand. Movini has kept me young for 30 years. He saved Francisca from a fatal-- - But Movini is dead now, you said so, that means there's no more venom. - There are a few drops left. (gentle music) Roll up your sleeve. (suspenseful music) Duff? - Huh? - I didn't find any more venom in the body. The last of it was stolen when your girlfriend-- - All I'm interested in is what are we gonna do when I start to turn old? - Duff, she was your girlfriend. You'll have to get it back. - Where are you going? - [Lena] I don't know. I just want to wander around for a while. - Don't you want to stay with me? - [Lena] I want to be alone. (speaking foreign language) - Okay. - Excuse me, do you know where Dr. Tezon's office is? - Can't we give her the venom right away doctor. I can't stand looking at her like this anymore. - Well I want to watch how much further her condition develops. listen I got a meeting to attend in the main building, will you stay and watch her. - Sure, is it all right if I go out and get some lunch? I'll be right back. - Okay. - Thank you. (curious music) - [Joanna] Lucy, was there any calls for Emilio? - [Lucy] Yes, Dr. Fernando about a file on a test. - [Joanna] Oh, did anybody call for me? - [Lucy] No Joanna. - [Joanna] Oh, you can go out to lunch now if you like. I'm just going to spend the rest of the afternoon in the lab. - I'm very sorry. (sultry music) May I help you? (man moaning) - [Ramon] Do you have to go? - I told you I have an appointment. - [Ramon] What's the hurry? You've got plenty of time. - I have to go, goodbye Ramon. (sultry music) (muffled chatter) - [Lena] Duff. Duff. (Lena screaming) (muffled chatter) We're saved, Duff. - Well I told you nothing bet on that white bird. - Anyhow that's only 10 peso's. - What a drag. You know I couldn't tell those dumb cocks apart. Why'd we come here anyway. - I don't know, I mean it wasn't my idea to come. - Listen. - I didn't want to look at a bunch of turkeys. - [Merkel] I thought the little orange one was just fine. - Well you did, why didn't you bet on it then? - I get enough of a kick watching the feathers fly. - [Harry] Hey, look over there. Now there's a classy looking broad for a change. - [Merkel] Say, I know him. Hi, how are you? - Hey, where do you guys know each other from? - We sort of arrived in town together. - Oh, yeah, hi. - How's your girlfriend? - Who? - The blonde chick. - Oh well I really haven't seen her for a while. - Who are your friends, Duff. - This is a sergeant, Sergeant-- - Merkel. - Merkel. - These are my buddies Jim and Harry. - Jim, Harry. - Hi. - And this is Lena. - Merkel, come on let's take off. We don't want to take time off his date. - Why don't you come around the Aurelio. I'll buy you a drink. - Okay, maybe. - And in exchange you can show me some of the local attractions. You seems have gotten along pretty well here. - Sure sometime I'll have to do that. - Would you really waste your time with those men. - I don't know. No, you never know who you may need as a friend. (suspenseful music) - [Lena] How do you feel? - I feel all right. But what happens when I start turning all-- - Don't worry. I have the venom in my body now. You'll always stay young as long as you stay with me. (suspenseful music) (gentle guitar music) (speaking foreign language) (suspenseful music) Please get on the table. Let me give you the venom you need. - I don't need any venom now. - Why wait until later? - Where'd you get the machete? - From a man in the rice field. - He just gave it to you? - I made love to him first. - What's wrong with me? I've made love to you whenever you wanted me to. - You're no good for that anymore. I love you but you can't give me what I need physically. You've got too much venom in your body already. - Each time? You need a new man each time? - Yes and I'm counting on you to help me. (exotic music) - How much longer do we have to stay in this town. I'm getting sick of shrimp. - [Merkel] You can go back to Nam tomorrow if you want to. (men talking at once) - This chick's big enough for both of us. - Sergeant Merkel. See any more cock fights lately. - Hi ya, didn't recognize you for a minute. Sit down, sit down, what's happening? - I figure I was just kind of lucky to find you here right now wasn't I. - I'd say a chance of finding me here are pretty good any time of day. - Oh, come on. What're you saying? You haven't been around the city that much. - What's there to do depends on who you know. Say, how's your little bit of a local color? - Huh? Local color. Room 423. (bell ringing) - Yes sir, may I help you. - Uh, no, no thank you. - Like a drink? (soft music) - [Lena] I didn't come here to socialize. - All right. - [Lena] If you don't mind I'll take off my dress now. - Let me start you. - What's that? - It's nothing, just some makeup. - You got some kind of disease. - No, I do not, sir. - Well if it's makeup let's see if it comes off. (Lena groaning) I don't know about you chicks running around cockfights. Take off your dress. - Don't you want to make love? - I wouldn't make love to you, lady. I'm too refined for that. (Lena screaming) (bell ringing) Oh so you really want to play after all, huh? Guess we'll have to pin you down little lady. (suspenseful music) (buzzer buzzing) - Lena. (suspenseful music) - [Joanna] Is there any way we could have saved her? - If the venom were to get administered steadily, small doses over a long period I guess. Otherwise it kills just like any other venom. - That's what's happening to Duff, I know it. - You don't know, Joanna. There's still a great deal we have to find out. - I don't think that there's anything more that I want to find out. I've had it, I'm sure of that. - You're just tired, Joanna. Why don't you go home and rest. Sleep on it. - Maybe you're right. I certainly can't stay in this crummy place one more minute. That I'm sure of. - All right, go home now. Call me in the morning. - Okay, but if we don't hear from him soon I've got to do something. Thank God I have you around. (gentle music) (suspenseful music) (snake hissing) (doctor groaning) (suspenseful music) Shh, Duff, it's me. You're in my apartment. - Joanna? - Shh, you're all right. - I had to see you. - You had me pretty worried. I thought you were dead or something. - I just know that I'm more scared than I've ever been before. - [Joanna] Scared of what? - I don't want to talk about it. I just want to hold you. (gentle music) (gentle moaning) (suspenseful music) (curious music) (muffled chatter) - Duff? Duff? (suspenseful music) (gentle harp music) - How much longer must I remain in this ridiculous human form? I can no longer be prey to these stupid and wasteful human emotions and instincts. I will return to you Damballa. No more fruitless and destructive unions. I'm only confused and frightened by these humans. I feel no love for them. I receive no pleasure. Only pain. Great Damballa it is my time to be with you. Incline to me thy power and return me forever to my rightful serpent form. I'm leaving you now, Duff. I brought you here so that you could see me this one last time, but soon our spirits and bodies will be closer than ever, as soon as my transformation is complete. - Your transformation? - Into Movini. My spirit is one with his now, and soon our bodies will be also. - But what will happen to me? - You'll be safe as long as I'm alive. You'll feed off my venom and stay young. - And after? After you die? - Deliverance, we'll be closer than ever. Our souls and bodies will be together forever. - But I don't want to change. - But don't worry if that's what's bothering you. (gentle music) You'll be human for a long, long time, as long as you protect me. - [Duff] Then there's no way out. - Soon after my fangs have entered your flesh, you'll feel ecstasy. Of course if you want to escape from me you still can if you dare. (suspenseful music) - Lope. (Lope grumbling) (suspenseful music) (Lope groaning) - Duff? Duff? (Joanna crying out) (gentle music) - Movini, think not of revenge. Incline to me only the power to return to you. It's all right, Joanna. But you've got to go now. - I can't go, I can't go without you. No. - You've got to. It's no use. Look at me. You can't want me like this. - I don't care. Let's just get out of here. Something'll happen. Maybe I can help. I don't care what you look like. - Look out, they're gonna strike at you again. Goodbye, Joanna. I'm ready to join you Lena. I only want to be with you now. (suspenseful music) (dramatic music) (gentle music)
