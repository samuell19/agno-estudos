All tucked in safe and sound. Aww, she's dreamin' about dog bones. [slurping] That reminds me I better get busy in the kitchen. Now that Brainy's asleep, who's gonna run the ship? (together) I am! (together) You are? You can't all run the ship. That's right, seems to me that I should be the leader because I, uh, uh.. ...I've got the longest tail. (Mammoth Mutt) 'Hold on there, Tail Terrier.' I'm the biggest and brainiest, if you ask me. I'm the one who thinks on his feet and that's a lot of feet too. Uh, guys? Guys, uh, maybe I should catch the berkelium crystals while you figure it out. (together) Go ahead! Okay. And while he's doing that I think we should repair the ship. That's exactly what I was gonna say. Yep, she took the words right out of my snout. [intense music] creak vroom [sighs] Space never seemed so peaceful. vroom splash [gurgling] [instrumental music] roar [grunting] If we're gonna get this ship shipshape..

[alarm blaring] [spaceship revving] [screaming] Aye, ah-ah-ah! [screaming] [grunts] [giggling] Excuse me. (Krypto) 'Get ready, guys. I'm heading for the surface.'

We've been swallowed by a murky megamouth blowfish. Where were you guys? [chuckling] Well, we sort of took a wrong turn. - Or two. - You're telling me! It's a macaroni disaster area back there! And I got a snootful of pepper too! Ah-ah-ah-achoo! Pepper! That's it! That's what? That's how we're gonna get out of here. But I'm gonna need you all to work together this time.

Who took charge of the ship? Well, we all did, unfortunately. We're awful glad you're up and around, Brainy. How do you feel? To tell you the truth I'm a little hungry. Oh, that reminds me I still got to make lunch. What do you want besides macaroni and cheese? I know! How about some fish? (together) 'No-o-o!' (male narrator) Krypto the Superdog in..

(Mechanikat) 'Say yes, you worthless underling.' Yes, you worthless.. Uh, uh, I mean, yes. Great! Come on in. How's he supposed to join the club? We've never had a new member before. Do I really have to join this bunch of losers? (Mechanikat) 'Only if you want to avoid getting locked out' 'of the spaceship when you get home!' Ah, before you can join you have to pass a special super hard test. That we just came up with. He he! Yeah, you have to show that you're not just a fan but a big fan. Yeah! Like us. No sweat.

Swear you won't tell, on your honor as a Supercat fan? Oh, yeah, on my honor. (Ramone) Sure, Supercat's defeated lots of bad guys but which one's the worst? I mean, the absolute, no good to anybody most worthless worst? - Mechanikat! - Mechanikat! You got that right. I heard that Mechanikat never even grooms himself. (together) Eww! Not only that, he's always eating fishy snack crackers, which he refuses to share. And he's got the worst fish breath ever. - 'Says who?' - Aah! How do you know that? I, uh, I saw it on the internet. (together) Oh! (Puff) You know who I feel sorry for? Snooky Wookums. Ha! You mean Mechanikat's little helper? - Yeah, right. - Aw, I bet he's okay. Working for Mechanikat must be tough. He is kind of cute. [gasping] I am? I mean, you think so? [chuckles] [gasping] Hey, watch out! [vehicle honking] [gasping] [honking] You'd better watch where you're goin', kid.
