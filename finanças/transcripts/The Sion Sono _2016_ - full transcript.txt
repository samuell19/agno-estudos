4 Sion Sono movies opened in 2015. Your name is associated with the unorthodox. People think you're a radical cult filmmaker. That's your public image but with 4 movies back to back, you're suddenly the hottest director. What do you think of that? There's a tradition in Japan of belittling the unorthodox. I think formality is overrated in Japan. I went to Norway where Edvard Munch is an admired artist. He's unorthodox! I think that shows something about Japan... Here people don't want Japanese culture to be represented by the unorthodox. In their thinking... They don't want something that lets down Japan as a nation. Or embarrasses it. The whole country praises something that won't embarrass them. Movies... They must be international unlike music and literature. - Only movies? - Yes. Yes, the other arts can be domestic but not movies. Fine art's the same. It can't just be for Japan. I don't care if the Japanese film industry sees me as "unorthodox." That's not how I'm seen abroad. Not that I've asked everybody overseas but... I'm not exceptionally unorthodox. "Paying power bills is not life" Aoyama, Tokyo July 2015 "My feelings are about to blow up." "My turtle makes me feel all right." "Since Tokyo was chosen to host the Olympics" "everyone walks 5 cm above the ground." About 5 months ago - Can we see your art? - Sure! Sono's studio in Shimokitazawa, Tokyo February, 2015 Wow, look at that! "To hate your parents is to hate yourself." "I have no more time." "You're born and you soon die. There's no time to relax." Wow... The price of canvas won't make me paint neatly. Nothing costs more than life, than each second! What's this...2015? Here we are, all together in this room. This is worth 50 million yen! Or even more. So here we are in the act of talking. It's 2015 and we're talking. It's priceless. See what I do with randomly chosen paint. Like this. It's not even a shape. That's what it's about. This canvas was expensive. It cost a lot. But you just apply paint without caution. That's how it starts. I messed up! It's ruined, right? What a mess... This is what adolescence is like. An adolescent canvas. She's been defiled. She lost her virginity to some fool. Now she doesn't care. Along comes another careless guy. Bad choice number 2. She's messed up her life even more! What now? Green and pink. Bad contrast. It's ugly. Now this. It's ruined! If the canvas was life, it's totally screwed! It's ugly. What's she going to do now? I worry about her future. Then Uncle Sion drops by... ...and pukes! Look at this, this is bad. It's a dramatic life. It's no longer white... It's not pure. Its purity has been lost. Life's bleak. A bleak future. The first man has gone too. The pink is all covered up now. So... If this was a 80-year-old woman she'd still have hope. She still has a bright future. While it's bright... this comes in. See? What's been done to this very expensive canvas? It was raped by a tsunami. A tsunami messes everything up! Her life is on the edge now! But this is the beginning for me. She's 18. She wanted a white, untainted life like the canvas... Many things have happened... And life begins. Life begins but nothing good will happen. Sometimes there're good things. I could... I'll show you something good. She wants to join AKB48. See what I'd do to that... A smart man. Like this. Here's a smart man. But I don't want to do this. He's 13 and acting smart. His classmates bullied him and he's gone. It's a mess! So what do you want to do? What now? This is the ultimate mess! This canvas... Look! It's dirty. So random. Is this good? Come on. Is this good? I don't know. Follow me. Tell me. Is this a good painting? How about this? This? Is this good? - Tell me, Oshima. - No. It's bad, right? But it's wonderful! I've been working on it since July 20, 2014. I painted some today too. Here, February 11. It's been almost half a year. It's not about if it's good or bad. Like a movie. From here I went to July 20... Life isn't about good or bad. Paint, express and live! That's good. When July 20 comes again... There's no good or bad. This is life. You got that? I'll continue working on it until next July 20. There's no good or bad. That's life. I'll show you how rough I'm with it. Here! Like this. You deserve it! Got that? THE SION SONO September, 2014 Hi, I'm Sono, the director. What's to discuss? - Can't the producer go first? - He's last. OK... It's called The Whispering Star. Let's make a movie without any accidents. We'll shoot with safety in mind. Thanks for your cooperation. Yoko's blood is blue fluid. Scene 33, practical effects. Night scene, walk to the mansion. A smoke machine for Yoko's walk in the woods. It's the road before Marin Park in Namie town, Fukushima. She has a flashlight and we'll make the leaves fly with wind. I haven't made a movie in a while that I put my heart into. I want to do my best but I've forgotten how to. It's been a while. It's unhealthy. It's hazardous to creativity. This one's going to wash me clean. All the indecent jobs I've been doing recently... - You'll wash them off. - Yes. I'll get clean then I'll have to do The Virgin Psychics. You can do that one for me. I don't want to read the script. - You're on camera! - I'm not reading it. When a project doesn't interest me, I work extra hard. For the record. Sometimes I rise to the occasion, like with Tokyo Tribe. That has your signature. Maybe it did but... I'm more committed to movies based on my scripts. We got the go-ahead for The Whispering Star and the set was partially constructed when the money fell through. It's a personal project for me. One of the themes is that even in space, there's everyday life. Science fiction movies since 2001 :A Space Odyssey have people on spaceships wearing spacesuits. I want an apron, like a regular housewife's. I thought an apron in space would be interesting. Just regular attire. She has to ride a bike through the deserted town. Because if there's no movement... It'd be just scenery. Like a shot in a karaoke video. If the camera doesn't move with her we won't see the shocking reality of the scenery. That nobody's there. - You drew these when you were young? - The storyboards? Yes. I was 27 or so. - You were very prepared. - Right. - You had time? - Yes. I had nothing to do all day. - Did it have the Fukushima scenes? - No! Of course not! To make The Whispering Star in 2015 I thought I'd integrate my feelings about 3/11 disaster. To make it more interesting. What's different between now and when you wrote the script 20 years ago? Well... I was pretentious and sometimes I was excessive. What I thought would be great isn't now after all those years. Because movies have evolved in those decades a preposterous story like that has become more acceptable. 20 years ago it would've made a very weird movie. Principal photography - Day 1 October 1, 2014 Kill it! Great! Good. We got a great shot. It's been 10 years. The registration ID is Z. "The Whispering Star" This is a poem I wrote about the weathering of memories. OK, lick it! This is a fantasy film about memories. How we've dealt with memories since ancient times. Seen through our memories of the disaster on March 11, 2011. It's me from the past, back for revenge. It's about time! Sono is working simultaneously on multiple projects. OK, Mr. Sono. About the project... The 2nd one's good. - They agree? - Well... They haven't decided. They want to see the treatment. You know the title? The Man from Goodbye. - The Man from Goodbye. - That's the title. Or The Woman from Goodbye. Have Woman in parenthesis. A man and woman. I'll decide which one comes from the past. I'll decide. The Man from Goodbye, for now. I might make it a woman. A man encounters a woman in the street. They meet and... They just met but he says "goodbye." They really hit it off but he says Goodbye. Because it feels right to say goodbye at that moment. He's very happy to meet her. He's euphoric. They're meant to meet. Will people outside Japan get this? They're always meant to meet. "I can only say goodbye." "What are you saying?" So it begins. I'm thinking about how it ends. They part. Maybe the man who came from Goodbye disappears as he steps into an alley. Or when a bus passes between them. Not a Japanese bus... Oh, a Japanese bus is OK. Or a train passes and he disappears. And The End. That's the movie. It's very romantic. Isn't it? I can write romance. Not just blood and gore. Who do you want to cast? I'll book them. Fumi Nikaido and... She's busy! And Shota Sometani. - Just 3 days. - Back to Himizu... Himizu It's unforgettable. It was our very first encounter. Fumi Nikaido and I were called in. It was for a read-through in the rehearsal room. That was the first day of pre-production. So I went. And Mr. Sono was late. Not only that but he was drunk. He came in and sat down. He told us to read. So Fumi and I started to read. We finished. But I'm pretty sure he was dozing. I thought, "Hey, he nodded off..." Then he lay down and slept. We couldn't just stop reading. It was my first Sion Sono movie. I was tense. When we finished, he got up. He said, "Are you done? You can go home." And I thought...what was that? It was like a challenge. The start to a roller coaster ride. I don't remember well. I noticed that he was asleep. He could have been drunk. I guess he was. But anything he said was insightful. He gave me a score. What was it? It was lower than Shota's. Each scene was very demanding. But I knew I could deal with them. I felt that I had been reborn. And... He was like a father figure to us on the set. We were like an adolescent boy and girl freely expressing themselves with Dad there. Let me see... He comes across as being adorable. It didn't take us long to become accomplices in crime so to speak. All his ideas are fascinating. He'd throw unpredictable and off-kilter ideas at me. I loved his ideas and we ended up exchanging ideas. We enjoyed that and kind of connected as a result. I want to play Sion Sono. I really do. The young Sion Sono. As the enfant terrible he is. I'm totally confident that I can play him. Hello. I see. This is good. The lantern! Can you spin it? Let me try. - It's spinning. - You can't see it... There's the carousel mobile. Is it similar to the storyboard you drew 25 years ago? Exactly. I never thought it'd be realized like this. If I was 30 making this and Love & Peace I'd have been called a genius. With girls after me. But I'm not 30 anymore... It's open. Yes. Oshima is with me. Sorry. It's a mess. Hi. Where are my keys? You're quick. - Otherwise... - You'd forget? - You were inspired? - Yes. I've got it pretty much covered. I'm done. It would probably be the same if I did this tomorrow but... Then again, it'd be different. An idea I come up with today would change tomorrow. It's storyboarded but I come up with new ideas. That's how it goes. Izumi honey! I'm hungry. Do we have something? Like yesterday's noodles... You talk about the shoot at home? No, hardly ever. Megumi Kagurazaka (Izumi Sono) I guess we don't. We don't, do we, Sion? This is my bible. Tropic of Cancer, within your reach. - You read it often? - No, but I want to, so I bought it. I gave Izumi a copy. She was like, "You got another one!” - How come? - He buys the same things. Often? He gives people his favorite things. We have many empty DVD cases. Mainly movies and novels? Movies. Sometimes CDs. - I buy many CDs. - The same ones. The same one over and over? Yes, I like to ruminate. He shows me the same scenes over and over. When he's drunk. Like an old guy repeating the same story. "The history of this mansion..." I'm like that. He can drink but I worry about high uric acid. That's a concern. You can drink but watch out for gout. Sorry. Was that boring? See you tomorrow. You met him... On Cold Fish. That's when we first met. Were you nervous at first? Cold Fish Not only was I tense and nervous... It was so tormenting that I don't want to remember. He pushed me to the edge. Can you tell us how? I was pushed... It was really intense. It was like everything I'd experienced was denied. So I was... I didn't know who I was anymore. All my experiences, hardships and sad times were denied. He'd say my acting didn't reflect my experiences. He'd say, "Is that the best you can do?" - Was that different? - In Guilty of Romance... We were dating then. So it was different but it was still tough. Yes... Because we were close... he was merciless. You know how you can be harsh to family members? Of course I wanted to give a professional performance. I wanted to meet his demands. If I failed him it would change our personal relationship. Our private life and work were one. So that was stressful. This makes you emotional. I don't mean to be rude but it's been 5 years but your response is raw. It's tough to remember. I don't know why. I break down when I remember it. I don't know. Nothing's bad now. It's just when I look back... I don't know. Each mistake I made, I... I don't know what I'm saying. Come to think of it I'm amazed that I got through it. He took you seriously as an actor. I guess he did. I threw myself into it then so I didn't... When I look back at those days I get all emotional like this now but I was OK then because I was totally absorbed. Sorry. Can I get my handkerchief? It brings back difficult memories... Let's have a break. Sorry. It's tough. Over here. It was a hard time. It was! The painful memories. There were many things... Like the woman who was hanging around him... I was mad. I don't even know why I put up with it. Let's change the topic. Many talented people have something lacking. How about Sion? I know what you mean. Is he hard to live with? I've come to accept it. He focuses on what he loves. He single mindedly follows his interests. He thinks that he doesn't need to remember some things. Like how to get places. He depends on others for that. He just doesn't remember! It's like Sion deliberately keeps his head clear. So he can concentrate on what he loves. It's amazing. - Does he cook or do chores? - No, he doesn't. It's sacrificed for his creativity. He can't operate a washing machine. He won't learn and he wouldn't wash clothes anyway. If he had a chance to learn how to cook rice, he'd rather read or see a movie. I guess that's how he's always lived. He must have washed his clothes when he lived alone. I don't think so. I think people did it for him. Someone who'd take it on for him. Do you argue? No, not recently, but... He used to come home late and want to continue a conversation he'd been having over drinks. I'd be sleepy and I'd say what I thought and it would become an argument. "I'll leave you!" He'd say it every time! "I'm leaving you!" Gnash your teeth hard, let's go! Now gnash and gnaw, let's fly! Sion Sono and the Revolution Q It's like a tingling bite Gnash 'em hard, let's go! Gnash your teeth hard, let's go! Now gnash and gnaw, let's fly! Keep 'em nice, Ga-Ga-Ga and Gi-Gi-Gi! Keep 'em shiny and clean! They won't talk about classical music or jazz. Rock music critics stick to rock. Film critics try to cover everything! - It should be categorized? - Yes! Some of them know nothing about horror films! But still... What category does Sion Sono fall into? I'm hard to categorize but it's frustrating in general. Your films are different. Riki Kinoshita, ART-SCHOOL Sion Sono is a category. I'm an outsider in the movie world. You're right about that. I'm out there. I am Sion Sono. But others make movies for a genre. The Great Passage fits into Human Drama. Who's doing literature movies? - Naomi Kawase. - Yes, and Kore-eda. - He's not necessarily... - He can be. Because there's nobody else. He's the last one. Kore-eda makes those movies but he can also be commercial. But Kawase is pure literature. Arata Oshima - The director Let's include him though. - Their category is Cannes. - Right. No one in Japan makes movies like literature. There's no Lars von Trier. He always talks about von Trier. A von Trier type movie wouldn't get funding in Japan now! A Lars von Trier movie is so much more interesting. There's nothing like his films in Japan! Japanese films in comparison are so boring. It's a different league! Stupid film critics would criticize Nymphomaniac and my movies. Then praise The Great Passage. Who do they think they are? These idiots would say Picasso is childish. Then they'd praise some picture of Mount Fuji at sunset even though it's rendered in the same old way. The time now is 3 PM. Please leave the area by 4 PM. Don't forget to do a radiation reading on your way out of town. Fukushima shoot, day 1. I don't usually get nervous on a shoot but I am today. I really am. We can see how big it is. It's the CIA! Hello, thank you for coming. Thank you for doing this for us. Ma'am, you have a little dialogue. Sono cast many local residents. Do I? You have some too, sir. If it's OK. It's just everyday dialogue. The fact that they're shooting it here is something that makes me sad but happy. I'll remember everything when I see the movie. I feel grateful. Just like his The Land of Hope, right? I bawled my eyes out watching it. As the memories fade... The movie reminds us of all that happened. I want it to jump out into the street. Maybe put a mannequin there. The wheel rolls out of nowhere... It rolls out then you watch it until it stops. You stop, put the bike down. And... You hold the wheel up, OK? Drop it then go back to delivering the package. And action. Again! Not good. Again! Last one. Rolling! This is a safety announcement from Tomioka town. The time now is 2:30 PM. It hasn't changed. In 3 years. Like my neighborhood. Nobody cleaned up around here. It's untouched. - I don't like remembering. - Right. Like that there. The ship. It was swept up on the tracks. But the vegetation has grown back around there. Canada goldenrods. They grow on barren land. - Really? - Yes, Canada goldenrods. Any untended land has those yellow flowers. - That's what it means! - Yes. They're pretty. Well... So it's no good there? - Right. - Not good at all? - There's nothing there. - I know. Pines are hardy. Last Sunday we dug around those trees and laid down activated carbon and fertilizer. Because there're no new shoots. I see. Thanks for coming today... Sir! Are you in farming? Yes, after I retired. For 35 years or so I was at Hitachi making semiconductors. Oh, really? Then I farmed. I had an organic farm. It was coming together. Then I lost it when this happened. It's unrecoverable. I'm still affected. I don't know what to do. - Where are you now? - Kashima. With... - With my family. - Right. Tell me, will this be a good movie? Will it be good? I'm not confident. It makes me feel cautious. There are the nuclear power plant employees. And the victims of the nuclear accident. It was nice to see them volunteering on our production. Our assistant was driving some of us to the location... Is the assistant's name Okitsu? The man in the back, Mr. Sato was from the power plant. He apologized to the local guy from Sun Mall. About the nuclear accident. The assistant was crying as she drove. The Sun Mall guy told Mr. Sato not to be sorry. Sato was glad to have this opportunity. He was happy to be able to apologize. He thanked me for the opportunity. And the Sun Mall guy kept saying that apologies weren't needed. It was a drama. Then they carried the dolly tracks together. And they closed the shop doors together. Really! They did! I was watching. The power plant man and the Sun Mall guy side by side. In respect to each other. That was an amazing moment. You missed it! While you shot me smoking by the sea. That's what documentaries are about. It's time. And cut! He's one of the Men of the Year. Amazing! - The most prominent. - Of 2014? Suzuki from Ghibli and Shun Oguri? - And Gekidan Hitori. - What did he do? People must say that about me! - Maybe he's the best director. - And you're the best comedian? That'd be an honour. Thank you! Let's practice for the shoot. Hold it near your chest. And your motto, Sion Sono? OK, I have "Quantity." From my belief, "Quantity over quality." Quality makes people cautious. So I go for quantity so I can advance. I just keep making things and one of them might be good. 39 feature length movies The next stop is Kozakai. Passengers should disembark from the front door. Toyokawa city, Aichi Prefecture When the light's on press the button to open. I used to get off at the wrong stop. And skip school. I'd hang out there. It's lost land...forgotten. For a virgin, everything's an adventure. Everything he does. High schoolers should be virgins. Anyone who wasn't, won't understand me at all. That's our gate. Roka! Roka? Roka! My sister's odd. - Odd? - Yes. Much more than me. She really is. She must be really unusual. The thing is, she has no social awareness. Sono's local friends You're better? I'm a model of social awareness. No sign of her with all that knocking. That's my sister for you. The house will be knocked down next month. - It'll be demolished. - What a waste... No, I won't miss it. The sooner the better. There she is! Hello. - The crew. - For what? For the movie. Roka, Sono's sister The lights are broken. It's so dark. We can't shoot in this. The light's on. Wow... Look at this. I made this, like when I was 14. A shark. It's Jaws. It had teeth! They're lost. It had teeth. I put them together for you. They bring back memories. All of them. The entire series! These are the scary ones. The Bandits' Under the Sea Witch's Coffin I remember these... All these Osamu Tezuka mangas. I was obsessed with Osamu Tezuka when I was 12. Published by Mushi Production! I could sell them for lots of money if I tried. - Phoenix? - A Mushi Production edition. Osamu Tezuka published them through his own company. - Lion Books too? - A Mushi Production edition. - They all are. - Apollo's Song? Very rare. You're clueless. Yes, they all look the same. I had more! She's our great-grandma! - A portrait? - Yes. None of us met her. It's so damp. Is it humid in English? - The manga he sold me! - Sold you? - He drew this in elementary school. - 2nd Graders' Best Friend "Free 2nd Grader Kit!" The Drifters... 2nd grade, alright. "In the February issue... A Hideki Saijo poster!” I'd love that. Great. I remember... - He sold it to me. - How much? - 30 yen. - Reasonable. The other one is 240 yen. - One was really expensive. - 800 yen. Was he a nice brother? Well...yes. We weren't really like a typical brother and sister. There was an age gap. - How much? - 5 years. I don't think our relationship was very equal. But he played with me and took me on his bike... And the manga he gave me. For a fee! I read those. You had to pay your brother? Right. Was he strange? No, but he became a little strange in high school. - Junior high essays. - I remember that! - Why? - I was blown away. Junior high? It's about a cat. - Cleopatra? - It's marked. About when the cat died. Here it is. "Chapter 1." Nobody else at school had chapters. Like a movie. Love Exposure. It's already started. "If I'd only had less curiosity." "Damn it" by Sion Sono That's a hook. Was he 15? He was 14! - "Damn it" is an unusual title. - Chapter 2, 3, 4... Chapter 4, "Dead." And it ends with "Damn it." Amazing! - At 14. - I thought he was a genius. If I'd been praised for this, maybe I'd... - Chosen a different path! - Yes, a novelist. But I was ignored. But your essay was selected. I'm talking about my environment. The people around me, like my parents. If they'd been more encouraging... I might have been an author. Contrary to his regrets... Sono's movie reviews from his junior high days. "The Exorcist Comes to Japan!" "Shampoo, Great, no less!' "The Sound of Music" "West Side Story" "Jaws, featured article" "I am the star" "Telltale evidence of excitement" "Ticket stub squashed in my sweaty palm" "Ouch! It could have been tighter." "The Godfather Part II is great but it drags at 3 hours." "79/100. For all the money spent." "The 3rd Annual Sion Awards" "Godfather Part II. Sorry, Jaws!" "Robert Shaw, Best Actor Faye Dunaway, Best Actress" "Steven Spielberg, Best Director. He made Jaws at 27!" "Director Sion Sono announces" "his first movie." "Patra and the Kitten, 3 minutes." "On an incredible 2,000-yen budget" "Audience response, 'It's not bad“ "Written, Directed, Shot, Produced, Composed by Sion Sono" "From Sion Sono, a genius" "Starring and directed by Sion Sono" I Am Sion Sono, 1985 Give it to me! It was on the web at one point. Naoto Tanobe Editor in Chief, Eiga Hiho magazine If you searched Sion Sono you got "The 3 wackiest maverick filmmakers." Sion Sono, Katsuyuki Hirano of Kantoku Shikkaku and Sho Fujiwara, who'd never shot a commercial film. Those 3 were known for their radical movies and they got attention. Sono is basically a poet so he writes monologues and shot a movie to it. Hirano had been a manga artist with a strong visual sense. Fujiwara wanted to be Bruce Lee so he shot kung fu movies at dams and abandoned buildings. Sion Sono should have become famous between 1990 and 93. If Why Don't You Play in Hell? Love & Peace, The Whispering Star were made in the 90s, it would have changed Japan's cinema history. I'm sure. No producer realized his potential. Those who knew Sono was great, didn't have money. It took Sono 2 decades to make the movies he wanted to do. It took way too long. Tokyo Gagaga! Sono sought other mediums of expression besides movies Tokyo Gagaga! In 1993 he organized Tokyo Gagaga, a performing group Sliding on the face of this boring Sunday. Where should I go today? A visit from the producer Sono worked with in his 30s. So this is your studio! I wondered what you were up to. Great Takaharu Yasuoka, Producer These are paintings for a solo exhibition. He was broke. If he called me, I knew he wanted to drink. So I'd go to Koenji where he was living then. We drank and I'd pick up the bill. - I thought he was an alcoholic. - I am! Hearing him now, I remember listening to him 20 years ago. Right. I was arrogant then. I was not open. Right now I feel completely open to your words. Every word you say I take in with all my senses. But 20 years ago I was pushy and would say, "I know a better way." It was like "I know what you mean but I'm here!" - Right. - Yeah. So I rejected whatever you said. But being rejected like that intrigued me. It was unique! I want the films I make to be interesting. But not because I want approval. Just to be interesting! That leads to destruction. Who cares if it follows the conventions of Japanese cinema? Forget the year-end top 10 movies! Something interesting comes from the rubble of conventions. But I wasn't so resolved in those days. I was also broke and I was nobody. I think you already had that mentality. When you brought me the idea for The Room I thought you were crazy. The 20-page screenplay was a collection of poems. 1 poem on each page. I wondered how it could translate into visuals? "Scene 1, a man stands." - It was "Scenery 1." - Right. - Like a book of poems. - I lost that! I still have mine. If I dig through some cardboard boxes... I read it and thought it was interesting and would make a great movie. I saw it as a 30-minute film but when we talked he said it'd be 90 minutes long. And you talked about grain. The film grain. I was impressed by your film knowledge. It'd be black and white and grainy. We had those really long takes with moving clouds and the subtle grain movement. It was stupid! It was something! The Room, 1993 The Room That was career suicide! Bicycle Sighs did well so I got some attention. I was offered to direct some teen pics like The Kirishima Thing. Then I went for a grainy movie instead. After that everybody stayed away from me for 10 years. I could see that coming but I shot The Room. So I was exiled and had to sit quietly for 10 years. - But I... - It was worth it. The Room was a blessing. It was the ultimate experiment. So the production companies stayed away. So I wrote screenplays including Why Don't You Play in Hell? and Love & Peace. 20 years later those films got made. You were shooting Bad Film. You can say that it all worked out in the end but... It tested my patience. At one point I couldn't stand not being able to make a movie so I bought a second-hand Aaton camera. I recharged it and went to sleep. I woke up to see clouds instead of the ceiling. Like, that line in Imagine. The battery from the camera... It combusted and the apartment caught on fire. - Your apartment burned down? - Yes. I thought the Movie God must really hate me but I had to choose, to make movies or not. I was definitely at a crossroad in my life. I mean... I lost my savings on the camera and I lost my apartment. Something was telling me to quit movies. It's the opposite. Movie Satan came. That's what I mean! It's not Movie God but Movie Satan. I prayed to the wrong guy! It was Satan, not God. I know what you'd say. You'd say, "Give me a break!" Not tight, like some women. Fast-forward! - All the nuance... - I love it. Can you rewind? We can lose this shot. Oh, good. The nail scene. Shibuya, Tokyo June,2015 OK, guys. Hey, Ellie! You're very close to Sono. What do you have in common? Ellie, Chim_Pom We're friends. Really good friends. He wants to transcend expression and ideas into the unknown. To see something new. He wants everyone to be happy as a result of his actions. "Happiness" sounds too cheap... But that's what his movies do to us. In that he's insanely gentle. I tell this to everyone. He's completely sane and insane. Who's in charge? - What's this? - Who's in charge? It's Sion. Address?

I don't know how long the dog has to wait but when people are repatriated there'll be a reunion. Hachiko is waiting for that day. The Fukushima theme has no end for you? Well, it should end. I want it to end. It's not that I want to continue but I always return. It's not my mission or obligation... But when I search my soul to express myself, I'm drawn there. This is cool. It's huge.

Sliding on the face of this boring Sunday The last day of the shoot September, 2015 Now can you get up? And stand here. I want to leave everything behind then move onto 2016. Everything.
