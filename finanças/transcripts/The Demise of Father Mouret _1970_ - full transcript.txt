Whoa! Holy Mary Mother of God! I'm going to kill you both! You should spill cold water on them, like dogs. I will teach you, for wallowing on my land. With my daughter. Scum! With your master's daughter. You miserable bastard! But I didn't force your daughter, Rosalie. She wanted that. Shut up, scumbag! Slacker! I will teach you. Don't you also want to marry her? And have a baby with her? And get my money too? Is that what I'm paying you for? Slacker! Go back to your plow. Faster. Giddy up! Go back to the farm, whore. I will whip you all the way there! If our Lord Jesus didn't forbid honest people from stoning the adulterous woman, maybe there would have been fewer whores. Demon. Go. Go! Stop. Do we offer our respect and obedience to our superiors? Yes, we offer our respect and obedience to our superiors. Why? Because they are above us. Who is the highest superior who gives us, through God, in his kindness? The Emperor Napoleon III. Brother, is the Emperor rich? Very rich. Like all the good people. Hell must be full of rich people, isn't it, Brother Archangias? Oh, really? Why? Because Father Mouret said that it's more difficult for the rich to enter heaven than for a cow to go through a needle. Father Mouret said that? That's the real road to perdition. It's you who will go to hell, you miserable little creatures. The big hairy devil will stab you with stakes in the heart. He will throw you alive in the fire. He will pull your eyes out. You can always shout, "I won't do it again." Too late. You will be damned. You will burn, eternally. Because you have committed all the deadly sins. Lying. Stealing. Gluttony. Laziness. Hold out your hands. Sin. Are you afraid of daylight, old owl? Of course not. But the housing inspector said that contributions for doors and windows will be doubled. So as a result, I will only have enough money for the door. And your children, don't they help you? They want me to die, yes. They think that I'm hiding some money. They must be really stupid. Well, I'm not dead yet. The old Corentin will go first. Is it going to be soon? She won't last until tomorrow. The Lord be with you. And with your spirit. If you seek him, he will be present for you. Glory be to Thee, O Lord. The Lord be with you. And with your spirit. Pray, brothers and sisters. Thank you, Father. Your lack of skill is pitiful. - Give me your tool. - No. Now this is a true Virgin Mary. She's beautiful. It's well painted. This thing will cost too much. This thing? It's our Holy Virgin Mary. I ask you to be respectful when you talk about her. I'm just saying that the parish lacks the means to renew the deteriorating sacred clothes. And the municipality refuses to pay for the most urgent repairs. so... So? I'm offering this to the church, where it's missing. For me, that one is enough. As for that, she's like a Parisian woman. Brother. I meant to say, a woman. The mother of our Lord was a woman. Exactly. Be careful with your devotion to Virgin Mary, Father. She'll take you too far. What's the matter? What's wrong? Nothing, it's the exhaustion. You're not eating, and you can't stay up on your feet. We still have to know, in these conditions, if the sacrifice is valid. If you don't want me to serve the mass, you should find us a choir boy. You might as well try finding a virgin girl in this country. However, women are still inadmissible in cult services, as far as I know. Even though nowadays, there are strange novelties. The church is dangerously losing ground with modernism. We can expect anything, even the mass in French. Come on. Let's be sensible, Brother. It will really make God angry, if we stop talking to him in Latin. He definitely won't understand another language. In any case, no one will attend your mass. Peasants have a lot of work in the fields this season. The people in Les Artaud are irreligious beasts and only think about their land. They would fornicate with their rocks if they could. We should never lose hope in sinners. You are a good person, Father That's the easiest part. But if religion is disappearing in rural areas, that's because it became too kind. It was respected as long as it was the master, without forgiveness. I wonder what they teach you now in the seminaries. The new priests are becoming soft like children. If this continues, we will see priests taking off their robes, wearing work uniforms, and hanging out with factory workers. Now that would be funny. Believe me, you won't get anywhere by setting an example, and being soft. Here, you have to lead them by force. After 15 years of trying to straighten the bastards, I haven't succeeded at making one single Christian. Don't you want to eat, Father? No doubt that he doesn't like my sandwiches. Don't be upset, La Teuse, I don't feel hungry today. Never. We have to feed the body. - Do you mind? - You had enough! I wonder why the Bishop assigned the poorest parish in the diocese, and the toughest one, to someone as delicate as you are. I chose Les Artaud. What a strange idea. At the seminary, I only dreamt of attaining salvation in solitude, and renunciation. But my confessor made me understand that I will be an outsider. Priesthood is a battle. A battle? Then you're in the right place. This very morning, I saw Bambousse beating his daughter for fornicating with Fortun?. And at this time, the heirs of the old Corentin are probably fighting each other. Corentin is dead? Maybe not yet, but she will die for sure. Why didn't you warn me? And what if she dies without salvation? But she doesn't want that. And what's the point anyway? She's already damned. During the 1793 revolution, she did the Goddess of Reason completely naked, in the church. Oh well. He hasn't lived his life, and doesn't know anything. It doesn't bother him to be pure like a young angel. He's the kind of young angels that Satan prefers. Hey! Serge, my boy. Uncle Pascal. Can't you call me Dr. Pascal like everyone else? You must be going to a patient. They came to tell me at Plassans. Jeanbernat, you know, the superintendent of the Paradou. Oh yes, the evildoer. He had a stroke at night. I still want to go and check. These old devils are tough. Take me with you, uncle. Maybe this unfortunate man will want to reconcile with God in his final hours. Him? You'll never convert that guy. Get in anyway. He will be cured just by seeing you. You know what? I don't think you're in good health. I would like to examine you. I'm not sick. A few mild headaches. From time to time. This needs to be examined, closely. Giddy up. - You've never been here? - No. It's hard to believe how close we are to Les Artaud. Albine. Albine. Albine? She's Jeanbernat's niece. She should be watching him, but where is she? Albine. What's the matter? What do you want from Albine? Well, well. How come you're up, joker? I don't need anybody. I bled myself with my knife. What is it? What is that? He's my nephew, a brave young man. I don't want bigots at my house. Their presence is enough to kill people. I told you, doctor, that I don't want priests or drugs when I'm ready to die. Otherwise, we'll just be angry. Since he's your nephew, this shouldn't stop us from sharing a drink. Albine. Albine. She's always in this damn Paradou. Albine. This is the first time I drink with a priest. Father Caffin, your predecessor, was afraid of me. He wanted to prove to me that God exists. - I welcomed him appropriately. - What do you mean? God doesn't exist? No, and I can prove it. I read a bunch of books, saved from the fire at the castle. All the 18th century philosophers have taught me so much about religion. Yes, Father. I believe in Voltaire, d'Alembert, and Diderot. And I don't believe in superstition, credulity, and faith. If you want to discuss that, then explain to me, if God exists, why does evil exist? But the Christ... precisely. The Christ. We're less miserable since he came, aren't we? The Christ of suffering. Do we even know if he really came? There's nothing, and that's the real truth. We're nothing but a little mould on Earth. All this is a joke. There's nothing. Before, during, and after. There is our eternal soul. What a discovery! Giddy up. I told you, with that man, you have no chance. The miserable thinks there is no soul. It's sad. I feel that he's so kind and sensitive. - Who made him superintendent? - The last owner of the domain is an aristocrat who lives in Paris. He seems to be involved in politics, and not interested in the Paradou. Albine, there you are. Where were you hiding? What's making you laugh? I don't know. I'm happy. You're the new priest of Les Artaud. I would like to visit you, and hear from you about God, but my uncle doesn't want that. You prefer to wander in the Paradou. It's my garden, and it belongs to me alone. - Goodbye, cute girl. - Goodbye, doctor. Goodbye, Father. Giddy up! Funny girl, isn't she? She was 10 when her father died, and ended up living with this pagan. Did you see how she looks now? Well, when she first came here, she was a little girl from the city. She was already knowledgeable and used to read, sew, and play the piano. And she was a coquette, with her embroidered skirts. Her straw hats from Italy. Her frills. Despite her attitude. We can say she came back to nature. She grew up in the Paradou, and Jeanbernat didn't interfere at all. What a strange way to raise this little girl, isn't it? When I mentioned that to Jeanbernat, he told me that we shouldn't stop the trees from growing freely. Well, Babet, your wild roses are beautiful. Every mule in the country has pissed on them. Lisa! Are you wallowing on the altar now? Give me this, hussy. Go! You want to celebrate the immaculate month with these shameless girls? It's a scandal to see women rubbing themselves against the altar. So close to the sacred relics. They desecrate the church. Are you done laughing, slackers? Move away faster! We should break their backs to make God accept them. To our dear mother Let's sing this new song It's the month of Mary It's the most beautiful month Father, you should have told me that you were going to the Paradou. Father Caffin didn't hide anything from me. His confessions must be very unpleasant. I know what I owe the endangered souls. Jeanbernat is a dog, and should die like a dog. I'd rather throw the host to a pig, than to bring it to that evildoer. May heaven crush him, along with his devil girl. Please, Archangias. That girl never had her communion. She grew up like an animal. I saw her running on hands and feet in a bush. She was jumping like a wild cat. Her lifted skirt was showing her thighs. If I had a rifle, I would have shot her, if we had the right to do that. She comes meowing every night around Les Artaud like pigs in heat. If a man ever falls under her spell, she'll eat him alive. You had a rough day, Father. You should go to bed. You are my refuge. The ivory tower where I preserved my purity. I put myself in your immaculate hands. I only want to be a child. And walk in the shadow of your robe. Queen of angels. Don't abandon me. Because I'm on the brink. I'm surrounded by sin. I'm trembling. Because the sin I'm facing has taken a human shape. Help me get rid of it. And deliver me from temptation. Liberate me from my vile body. Have mercy. Have mercy. Mother. Oh venerable virgin. Give me the death of everything. Mother, mother, save me. Help me. I wasn't sleeping. I heard you. Walking slowly. How do you feel? You're real, aren't you? This is not a dream. I'm next to you. But how? Nobody knows in Les Artaud who brought him here. Don't say anything, alright? Who do you want me to talk to? I never see anybody. And he's cured now. Cured? I really thought that this bad fever might mercifully bring him back to his senses. I'm not worried anymore about his senses, but... But what? His memory. He doesn't seem to remember his past. Does he want to remember it? You see? Those burning rocks, there, at Les Artaud, and the mistral. That was very bad for you. Les Artaud? The village. The village? You need trees. Tranquility, and fresh air. Nobody will bother us. You don't need drugs anymore. You need to be loved. Marthe, Serge's mother, was a hysterical sanctimonious person. His father ended up criminally insane. They're dead? And Serge is alive and well. Alive, yes, but the recovery will take a long time. And I don't want him to return to Les Artaud right away. He's welcome to stay here. Albine wants to take care of him by herself, so let her continue. Are you still alone here? Of course. I want you to be alone. All alone. You have to talk to me, so I stop hearing these bells. It comforts me to hear you talking. Do you want to drink? Your hand is soft. It relieves my pain. Do you want me to open the curtains? - No, no. - It's really nice outside. - You'll see the trees. - No, please don't. I don't care about anything except you. Keep your hand. I want to sleep. Everything is dead. I am dead too. I'll never see you again. The underground. I'm suffocating. For how many years... These rocks in front of me... How can I get out? Tell me my good friend. I'm lost. I'm strayed. Where is the church? My church. Let me go. Let me go! Watch out! The bell. The bell. It's falling. It's dark. Stop talking, Serge. Please, baby. When you'll wake up, The sun will be back. For us. The sun. Life. It's beautiful, isn't it? The garden is behind the trees. It's huge. This garden belongs to me. And it belongs to you too, now. I'll never have enough strength. Yes, yes, I want that. You'll see. There are places I've never visited. We'll discover them. The beautiful garden that you promise me, scares me. My uncle tells me the same thing, but he's old. And we're young. You're still weak. You'll see soon. Soon. You're so handsome. I've never really seen how handsome you are. It passed. Where are you taking me? Where do you want to go? You come back sometimes with petals in your hair. And you smell like roses. The smell of roses is too strong for you. I can never sit under the rose tree, without wanting to cry. Where will you take me? Far. Very far. Who built this castle? A rich master, a long time ago. He came to live in seclusion with a lady. Very beautiful. Like a queen. He was hiding her well, behind high walls. Nobody ever saw that beautiful lady. The castle was a palace. There were pools. And fountains everywhere. The lady never left the Paradou. And died in it. Is she buried here? Definitely. Then the castle burned down. When the master left, his hair was all white. The Paradou was abandoned. - You know, the lady? - What lady? The beautiful lady. She knew a nice shady place. And used to spend days there, and whole nights. I haven't found it yet. You're dreaming. No, it does exist. But where is it? I looked everywhere. But now you're going to help me. What a joy it will be for us. To sit in the shadow of the tree. The big tree. Where we live a whole life in one minute. The dead lady is buried there, I'm sure. The joy of stopping there is what killed her. The tree has a shadow whose charm can kill. I want to die Like that. You'll take me in your arms, we'll be dead, and nobody will ever find us. Stop it. I want us to live in the sun, away from that deadly shadow. It must be forbidden to sit down under a tree whose shadow is that scary. Yes, it is forbidden. Everyone told me that. But dying happily, is not forbidden. We'll find him together. God. Say that you want that. I want that. We're lost. You're not afraid? No, there's nobody here except us. Let's walk slowly, and not find our way back quickly. I love you. I love you. How do you love me? More than everything. To the point of giving you all my heart, and leave nothing for the rest of the world. Why do you love me? Because you came along. Let's go quickly. Let's go. Let's get out of here. Serge! Serge, I found it! I found it! Serge! Serge, I found it, I found it! I found it! I found it! Please, don't tell me anything. I don't want to know. If you prefer staying in this stifling room... We were unhappy for a while. There, if you want, everything will be like before. The garden will love us again. It's a lie. It's not forbidden. They said that so we don't disturb them in the most beautiful part of the garden. Once we're there, you'll be perfectly happy. And only then, we will know everything. We'll become the real masters. Come with me. It's really nice to hear you say that. If you knew... It's an indescribable joy. It won't be possible for me to be happy, if you don't come. We will live there, to love each other, forever. It's a tree of life. Do you want that? Do you want that? It's there. I love you, Albine. I love you, Serge. You're not angry at me? You'll see. I'll be very discreet. Didn't you hear that? They are the noises of the garden. Someone came in. I beg you! Take me with you! Hide me! Let's hide! Serge, don't look! Don't stop! Have mercy! You promised to always love me. You can't reject me. Les Artaud. Les Artaud. God, we have sinned. Let's run away. Get up! Death will enter through this hole. I don't know who I am anymore. I killed myself. I have my own blood on my hands. Do you love me? We knew that you were hiding there, with this naked female. This is an abomination. She has dragged you into corruption. This whore has tempted you. And for her sake, you disobeyed God. Don't touch her anymore. She's the door to hell. Do you love me? Do you love me? In the name of God, get out of this garden! In the name of God... Your mercy is infinite. But I have sinned beyond the sins that you suffered so much to redeem. I'm not asking you to forgive my mistake. I'm only asking you, my Lord, to give my guilty body the force to fulfill my duty, and to give my lost soul, at the bottom of unworthiness, the slightest gleam of hope. Dear brother. Dear sister. You are united in Jesus. It's a link that nothing can break. And God wants it to be eternal. So man doesn't separate what heaven has joined. You must love each other, through the love of God. That's how you will walk together, without ever losing your way, and you will find happiness. She could have left her baby at home, on her wedding day. Cute baby. Are you done with your dirty talk, you bunch of sluts. If you continue, I will throw you out. When I think that she has a baby, and yet she wears a white wedding dress. Slut. My dear brother, it's God who's giving you today a companion. Because God didn't want men to live alone. Nothing is better than loving, except protecting those we love. Take your woman in your arms, and may you be damned if you ever abandon her. When are you going to stop watching me? I can feel you monitoring every move I make. Your soul is in danger, and I'm looking after it. The danger has been pushed away. No, that carnal decay is not dead. I'm not asking for your trust or your pity. I'm simply asking for your charity. You're not entitled to anyone's charity. You should atone in despair. It's him, the beggar. I should have known, because I noticed the smell of rotten cadavers. Come with me, brother, please. Hey, good morning, Father. Don't run away, are you afraid of me? So, Father Mouret, we don't see you anymore at the Paradou. I've been very busy. You are free, everybody is free. The only thing that bothers me is that my little girl was under the wrong impression. She thinks you stopped visiting because of me. Even though I'm not annoying. You must admit that. Well, well! Are you walking your pig, Father. Wait a minute, you atheist dog. I swore I would go cut your ears during your class, you bigot. For abusing the children. But in the meantime, I have the urge to beat you. You spit on the church, I saw you. You steal the consecrated hosts to make the girls have a miscarriage. Murderer! I will report you to the police. You're the one who's going to jail, you slandering bigot. What a foolish priest, with all the stories he tells. Please, I'm begging you. You shut up. You are his accomplice. He made you desecrate the cross. You're despicable. Sorcerer! You must have laughed when you imprisoned a priest. At night, you were injecting rage into his head. You made him an animal in heat. And your slut, it's you who threw her naked in his bed. Idiot! In his bed, yes, bastard, completely naked. And you put a crucifix in the mattress, to desecrate it. I will exterminate you. God is guiding my arm. And now, that's enough. You have annoyed me so much. I will cut your ears. Stop it, stop it! This is horrible! Come on, Jeanbernat, you're crazy! You're wrong, Father. This bigot needs a good bleeding. Well, since it aggravates you, Father, I will wait. She's been really sad for a while now. I don't hear her laughing anymore. Well, you'll come back if you find it in your heart. Have a good evening, Father. Listen Father, your mistake has made me your superior. God is telling you through my voice, that if you go back there, you will suffer horribly in hell. Father. Hey! - What? - It's served. Where were you again? You should be careful, Father. Since your illness, there are moments when you look deaf, and blind. You have to regain your health. Come on, eat my soup, it's good in your condition. I don't think so. No. Do you intend to spend another day without eating? I'm not hungry. You should tell me what's hurting you. Thank you my dear La Teuse, but I don't have any pain. What you suffer from, you'll keep it on your conscience until it suffocates you. If you were feeling so good there, Father, then you must go back. There must be someone better than me to take care of you. We should never commit sin. Serge, I came to get you. I've been waiting for you for days, and weeks. Give me your hands. Let's go. You shouldn't be here. Go away. You will only increase your suffering. I don't suffer when I'm yours, and when you're mine. You are wrong. I belong to God. Will your God be angry at me, even though he's the one who made me how I am? This is blasphemy. You're desecrating his house. Let's go then. I can't. I am a priest. When I saw you so free, I thought you were no longer a priest. So, you're not a man? Your pain shouldn't be considered a crime. Despite how unworthy I am, I still pray for you every night. Keep your prayers and your deaths for yourself. - You live in a pit. - No. Here, everything comes back to life, and climbs to the source of light. Look. Look at all the suffering that my God endured for you. For me. Jesus is beaten with a rod. His flesh is torn. He's bleeding. The soldiers are insulting him. His face is covered with spit. Remember, Serge. You were only thinking about living. - And being happy. - Shut up. He gets up on the cross. He falls, and gets up again. He struggles under the weight of the cross. He carries on his shoulders all the sins of the world. Look at me, Serge. Remember the flowers of the garden. The roads we took. Our happiness. Who talks about happiness, when Jesus is on the cross. The nails going into his open hands. His bones are cracking. The weight of his tortured body horribly tears his wounds. Jesus dies on the cross. Darkness propagates. The Earth trembles. The sepulchers open up. Let the dead bury the dead. Come. Life is full of light, and love. You're right. Death is what exists here. Death is what I want. It's what delivers us from all sins. I ignore life. I refuse it. I spit on it. Your garden is a mass grave. There's nothing there but evil and darkness. Go away. So it's over? You're pushing me away? And yet I am your woman. Go away! We're going to die. To die. - Is Serge there? - He's reading his Breviary in his room. - Should I call him? - Reading his Breviary? No. Don't call him. I'll strangle him. Tell him that Albine is dead. Do you hear me? She's dead. Tell him also that she was pregnant. This will please him. Giddy up! What are you doing there? I'm digging a hole for the young girl. She'll sleep well in it. My poor friend, this is not permissible. What do you mean? Do you think I'm going to let the priests take her? I will welcome them with gun shots. You can't fight the law. Oh well. The farce is over. Let them take her, since they killed her. For the last time, I will tell you that it's extremely sacrilegious to bury a pagan who committed suicide in a Christian land. Go away. You're not welcome here. We'll see what the Bishop think about that. Oh Lord. Our Father. May you rest in peace. I'll cut the left ear some other time. THE END
