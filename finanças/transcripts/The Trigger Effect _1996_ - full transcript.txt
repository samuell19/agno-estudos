- It was a cold bitter wind, and it blew, and it blew. It blew through the trees and the little town too. It blew past the houses where the children were sleeping. It blew through the keyholes where peepers were peeping. It blew down the streets that were shrouded in slumber. Rattled the roofs right down to the lumber. I'm so sorry, man. I am so sorry. What? I don't understand what you're sayin' man. Like I said, man, I'm sorry. - $5,000 hand suit. - Hey, you don't say excuse me? Huh? - Come on, come on, we're late. Come on, we're late. - You see that? - He's a jerk. - I can't believe he did that to me. - Forget about it. - Did you see what he just did to me'? Yeah, you wanna do somethin' about it, do you? Yeah, I didn't think so. - Don't worry-- - Would you stop touching me'? I'm sorry. - Hey, hey! - Hi, guys! - I got the tickets, we're all set. - Thanks a lot, Greg. - See what I mean about him? - What? - I don't even know why we go out with them. - Hey, he's just in a bad mood, okay. Come on, we're late. - No, no. I wanna get something to eat. - Next. - Hey, I was waiting! - Well I didn't see you. - Yeah, well you see me now. - No, she was next. - Okay' - Was somebody talkin' to you? - Popcorns, one with no butter, one with really, really light butter. Two medium diet Pepsi's. Wait a second, how much is a large? - 2.75. - If I only had, I want to spend $10 total. Do I go to a smaller size? - And she done made me miss the beginning of the movie. Shit. Hey, Johnny? Johnny? - Over here. - Where? - Right here. - On. - Ow. - Hey, where the fuck is the popcorn? - I'm standing in the line, right'? And this chick walks right in front of me. Blows right past me like I don't exist, and goes to the counter. - What? - Yeah, and I'm sittin' there like, hey there's a line here. And she basically says, fuck you. - That's fucked up, man. Yeah, I know it's fucked up. Hate coming to movies around here. I hate this whole neighborhood. Man, she just blows right past me! - What'd the girl look like? - What do you mean, what did she look like? Don't know-- - What, you don't know what the girl looked like? - No, I don't know what she looked like, Johnny. I didn't take her picture either, she had curly hair. - They got to talk about this right now? It can't wait? - Hey, check this out, man, Kenny told me about this. - I got to say something. - You should. - Aw shit, my brother's got a truck like that. He's got a truck just like that, man. Hey, yo, what'd she just say about me'? - What, who? - Right here, man. This girl, she said something about me, man. - Look, I don't know-- - What the fuck did she just say about me? - I don't know what she said, Johnny. I don't know what the other girl looked like. Stop asking all these dumb questions, man. - Hey, fuck you. You ain't the one we're fucking, so shut the fuck up bitch. Better turn your narrow ass around and watch the motherfucking movie. Psh. - You want to move? Come on, let's move. Thank you. It got hotter? - Did you like it? - Yeah, it was all right. Yeah. I liked it. I was scared. - Yeah, you like to be scared. Yeah. - Let's go to that place around the corner. Cool? - Yeah. let's go. - I thought we were on three. - No, no, we're here. Boy, those guys, huh? Yeah. - Those guys are behind us. - Yeah, I know. - You think I should have said something? - What? - Should I go back in there? They're probably gone by now. - You know, I'm almost certain we're on three. Aw, baby. - You gonna go see? Yeah. - Thanks. - Debbie, is everything all right? - What a night. Hm. Debbie's been chowin' again. God. Two more weeks. Mm-hmm. I don't think so. Aw... Jesus Christ. Money well spent. I hate these guys. - Oh, god, you're so hot. You're so hot. Aw. it's okay. - What's the matter? - Honey, she's burning up. She has a really bad fever. Feel her. Will you get the thermometer? - Yeah! - It's in the second drawer. - I know where it is! - Oh, god. You're so upset. - How much do we owe you, Debbie? - 28 bucks. Please. - You know, maybe she has another ear infection. Yeah. - You should really call him. - Here, that's 20 bucks. I will, I'll ask him for the pink stuff. One guess what he said. - Not to worry unless it's over 103, and he'll phone a prescription in the morning. - You got it. - Same thing he always says. - Yeah, he mentioned that too. - He actually said that? - Why does he make us feel like such idiots? - Did you tell him? - No, I didn't tell him. Have you seen my other watch? I think I lost it. - See what I've been saying lately? - I probably just left it in New York. - Oh, yeah, right. - What do you want me to do? Start accusing the world? Pointing fingers, conducting strip searches? - Well, things have been missing lately, right? - I think that's a sweeping statement. - And there have been a lot of workmen in the house. I mean, I'm not making any accusations, but isn't it true? - I think we mislaid a few things, that's all. - God, go run for congress. - I don't think you love me anymore. - No, not for years. - Tell me you love me. - Why should I? - 'Cause I want to hear it. - Hang on. I'm thinking. - You are evil. Profoundly evil. - No, I'm a nice girl now. - Yeah, whatever happened to the wild child? - I wonder. - Oh, why don't you come over here? Why don't you come here and sit down? Say something, Annie. - Gee, it's my turn again. - Harry, what's happening? - It's all right! - Look, there's Bartholomew, see? Right there. He's in his window. His hair is blowing from the wind. Whoosh! He's getting ready to fly away. He's gonna fly over the town. See? Hey, want to turn the page? Want to turn the page? Here, let's do it together. You ready? There we go. Yeah, yeah. Who's that? What color is he, huh? He's red. He's red. The wind whistled past lampposts, screamed over the lake, all in search of a boy who was still wide awake. Bartholomew went to the window and stared. He wasn't much drowsy and wasn't much scared. He knew that old wind was nothing to fear. With a bed sheet to sail and a pillow to steer, he could ride that old wind right into the night. Take off like a rocket, a Bartholomew kite. But this would be no breeze, it's safe to assume. Granddaddy of winds had blown straight to his room. " Oh, god. What? - The power's out. - Don't move. Either it'll come back on right away, or it's gone for good. - All right. We're waitin'. Ah! - Check the circuit breakers. Maybe it's just us. - Nope, it's the whole neighborhood. - Really? Man] Mm-hmm. - A blackout, fun. - Yeah, hysterical. Steph, is that you? - Matt, Matt? Yeah. Hey. - Oh, sorry. - So, what do you make of this, huh? - Uh, blackout? - Do you mind? - Oh, sorry. Got any idea what caused it? - I don't know- Seemed like a storm was coming. Maybe that was it. - Yeah, or Raji using those weird power tools again. Oh, Christ. Hot pants, here comes chuckles. - How are you, Mr. Schaefer? - How are you, Mr. Schaefer? - The power's out. - Jeez, we hadn't noticed, Rudy. We were just tryin' out our new flashlights. - One of you call it in? - I think they already know. - Well one of you should call it in. - Hey, don't get involved, Rudy. You never know what kind of list you're gonna end up on. - That's almost funny. - Oh, have one for me, will ya? - Okay' Hey, Sunday. Football? - Oh, yeah. - Don't forget to make your picks. - Yeah, yeah. - I mean it! - Okay. Hey! Lock your doors and windows. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Hey, Rudy! What's that behind ya? - Oh! - She's worse. - What? - Her fever, it's worse! - The power's still out? " Yes! I think it's an ear infection. She only wigs out like this when it's an ear infection. Will you call the doctor? - Okay' I'll call the doctor. This isn't gonna work! Wait, wait. I'm gonna go get the pink stuff. - Did you talk to him? - No, the phone's screwed up. It's makin' this weird noise. - Really? Yeah. I'm gonna be back in about 20 minutes. Okay? " Okay_ - Do you want anything while I'm out? - Um, no, I'm all right. - Due to the power outage, we cannot accept credit cards, ATM cards, or personal checks. Use the smallest bills you have, please! Thank you! - Come on! - Ah, he said he'd call it in this morning. - The circuits are busy. He'll keep trying. Why don't you check back in a couple of hours? I know what it is. It's amoxicillin. In the pink liquid with the little eyedropper. - Maybe you have a refill on an old prescription? - Yeah, can you check the computer? - No. - Look, um, if you can just let me have it, I promise I'll bring in a prescription when the power's back on. - Now, I can't do that, sir. I could lose my license. - I understand. I'm not saying that. - There are other people in line. Yeah. Have you ever seen a baby with an ear infection? It's really painful. They try and put their whole fist in their ear. It breaks your heart. - Uh-huh. - We're not talking about morphine here. It's penicillin. - Listen, what do you want me to do? I'm not a physician, I can't prescribe drugs, and the law is the law. - Yeah, but you know me. - I don't know you. - What do you mean you don't know me'? - I mean, I don't know you. You ask me who you are, I don't know. - I've been coming since we moved here. Over a year I've been coming here. - What do you want me to tell you? - I watched you fill this exact same prescription three times. It's on a little shelf five feet behind you. How hard can it be? - You know, you're very insulting. - I'm not insulting you. - I don't like you. - You don't like me? No, I don't. - Well, I'm not trying to start a fight. - Would you just step out of line, okay? - No, no, I am not gonna go home to a sick child without the medicine she needs because of some asshole who hasn't got his... - I'll tell you what. You get your skinny little butt out of my store, or I'm gonna push your face right through the back of your head. - Oh, thank god. You got the liquid, right? - He wouldn't give it to me. - What? - This idiot pharmacist. God, this phone! I got into a huge fight with the guy. The doctor couldn't get through or something, and so he can't give me the prescription. Legally, he can't dispense without the prescription. You know what he said to me? He said he doesn't like me. I mean, what's that about? He doesn't like me? - Matthew! Her fever is out of control. - The phones are gonna be back on soon. - No, you don't know that. I mean, we don't know anything right now. Look, I tried the car radio, and all I got was static. - I know, I know. - All over the dial. Know! Just give her to me, will you? - You don't have to yell. - I'll just give her a cold bath like the doctor said we should, maybe-- - I tried that. God, what do you think I've been doing all this time-- - What are you doing? - I'm gonna take care of it. - No, I'll take care of it. - How? I don't need the diagnosis, I have the diagnosis. I just need someone to write down the prescription. - Look, I understand completely. The problem is, Burnside and St. Joseph both lost their backup power. So we have triple the load we usually have. - She's in pain, alright? All she needs is this prescription. As soon as possible! - Please! - I promise, sir! I promise! - Immediately before you are towed. Move immediately. You're blocking the entry by emergency vehicles. - Excuse me. Some help over here, my mother. Sorry. - She's got a terrible fever. - Hello, hello. Hello, hello. Hel, hello. Hel, hello. Hello, hello. - I'll be back to pick you up in 10 minutes. - Matt! - The store will be closed in 30 minutes. - No, you calm down. I've been writing checks in here for 17 years. - Out of stock crap! - Let me check that. Yeah. Hey! Hurry UP- Oh, Mr. Pharmacist. Hey! Come here. That guy, stop him! - Sir, we have a problem here. - No problem. - Hey. hey, hey! Look out! - Son of a bitch! - Get out of the car! - Hey, hey, oh, Q, Q. Aw, shit! What is the matter with people? - She asleep? - Yes. - Good. - Hey, I'm really sorry that I was a bitch before. - You weren't. - Yeah, I was. Well, at least the phones are working again, huh? - No. - Well, they got the prescription. - Not exactly. - Well then, why'd they give you the stuff? - They didn't give it to me exactly. - What do you mean? - What do you think I mean? - Matthew! Mm-hmm. - You stole it? Mm-hmm. - Oh, my god. You didn't hurt anybody? - Mm. - Did anyone recognize you? - I don't think so. Don't like this. - You like something about it. - Right here. Mm-hmm. What, what, what? - There's somebody outside! - What? - There's somebody outside. He's looking right in the window. - Wait here. - I didn't watch you guys makin' out at all. - What are you doing sneaking around out there? - The bell doesn't work. - Hey, Joey. How are ya? - I told ya to stay back there. - I'm sorry, Sarge. - Your mail sucks. - Oh, let me get this. - Don't you guys have any idea what's goin' on'? - Yeah, it's a blackout, right? - You mean you didn't hear? You don't know? - Know what? - The Martians have landed. They want our women. Watch her like a hawk. - Did you find anything out or what? - Well, you know I got my own theory. But a guy across the hall says that a meteor landed in the preserve last night. But he's lied to me before, so I don't know if that's true. - Don't smoke in the house. - Mm, mm, no, I'm not, I'm not. And the guy in line at the Food King said there was a meltdown at Indian Point. And the checker at the Food King said that he saw the meteor. But that's not our problem. Our problem is our grid's screwed up. - Okay, so, how come the phones don't work? - I don't know. Their grid's screwed up too. - So that's all you got? Rumors from the Food King? - Hey, how am I supposed to know? How am I gonna know, huh? - This is such a drag! - Well, not for me. Now I got the day off. - So what's goin' on? I mean, really? - I don't know- People are freaks, man. I heard all this stuff about looting and shootings last night. - Wow, people were killed? - That's what I heard, yeah. - No, I don't believe it. - Well I do, if it's near where I used to work. - How many? - I heard a lot of different numbers. They're not small numbers. - We don't know anything for certain, right? I mean, this is just talk. - Right. So let's go find out. You want to go out there? - What are you doing in the middle of the road like that? - Just relax, okay? She's not in your face, I'm in your face. - Unbelievable. These people are crazy. - You know, Joe, if you want to, you could come back and stay at our place. You know, until the power comes back on. - That's okay. Thanks though. - Well, I'm just saying. You know, if you don't want to go home and be by yourself-- - Well, if he doesn't want to. - I'm just offering. - Yeah, but he said he doesn't want to. - Come on! It'll be fun! You know, it'll be like camp or something. All right? We'll get drunk in the dark. It's not a big deal. - Well, if you want me to. And you don't mind. - Why would I? Come on! Fucking move your car! 62 bucks? That's all we have from the three of us? This is pathetic. - Well, we got a box of change in the closet. There's probably 50 bucks there. - I got a whole bottle of Tequila, but the scotch situation is very grim. - Well, cash is the problem, right? ATMs are all down, no one's gonna take Visa. We don't need much money. - Yeah, we got to buy stuff. We need batteries. - We got batteries. - And water, we got to buy diapers, and candles. - And a gun. - Are you crazy? - Hey, unless you have one, I don't. ' A gun? - Hey, everybody just relax. It's not like I'm gonna take it out and kill anybody with it. - You wanna buy a gun? - No, no, we should talk about this. - No, I hate guns. You hate guns. - I know, but let him make his point. - I don't like guns either. But let's not be idiots here. Power's out, TV, phones. I mean, come on, do you remember a situation like this ever? I'm just saying, it might make some sense to take some precautions. - I think you're right. I was thinking the same thing. I didn't want to say anything 'cause I know how you feel about guns. - How we feel about guns, remember? - You know what it is, Annie? It's about not being naive. - You've never even shot a gun. - Yeah, I have. - It's not that hard. Yeah. - Come on. - Well, we're just talking. - Let's not! As a favor to me? Please? God. Come on, baby. - Okay, let's go. - Really? - Yeah, it's my house too. - All right, stud. What about money? - We'll think of something. - I'll drive. - All right. Be back in a half hour. - I knew it. I knew it. I knew it. Daddy's being a jerk. Boys will be boys, huh? Boys will be boys. - Hey! Watch what you're doin'! - Cash only, 15-day waiting period on all handguns. So don't ask me about the handguns. Forget about the handguns. We're out of 12 gauge shells, and all ammunition for 22s, .38s and .45s, unless you want hollow point. You want hollow point? We got that for .385 only-. So, what'll it be? - Hey, I got a quick question. - You handle it. Now, I have this gun-- - Why me? - Cause you're in construction. You're better at this kinda stuff than I am. - Huh. - Come on, fellas. We got the world waiting behind you now. Next, please. - Hold on. Hold on, we're ready. We're lookin' for something for home defense. - Of course you are. How much cash do you have? - Here, I've got this. - That's a $600 watch. - I'll give you $300 credit. Now, what I recommend, 12 gauge, pump-action Wysler Guardian. Blue-steel barrel, wood-grain stock. Extended tube for an eight-round capacity. A 12 gauge is a good gun, a 12 gauge is a house gun. Got a big bang, got a big pattern. You don't have to be a genius to hit something. 18 1/2-inch barrel, shortest barrel legal in this state. But if you feel your personal safety requires something a bit more easily concealed, go across the street to the hardware store, get yourself a hacksaw. Even throw in a box of shells. - You said you were out of 12 gauge shells. - Okay, fine. My mistake. That's the deal, gentlemen. $300. You want it or not? - 300? The tag says 95. - Yeah. - All prices are triple. - What, are you kiddin' me? - Look, pal. You're the one that comes in here to try and buy a shotgun in the middle of the blackout. And don't take the moral high ground with me. You want the gun? Or you want the watch back? Take your pick. - I'm a licensed carpenter's foreman, I'm not in construction. You think you could keep that straight? - Come on, man, I don't mean anything by that. - Maybe it's all the same to you, it's not to me. - Joe. - And I'd like to know what the fuck the fact that I build houses has to do with buying weapons, Matt. - It means you're better at bargaining and that kinda stuff. - Oh, you're so full of shit. - Look, I'm not going to stand here holding this incredibly impressive weapon and have an insipid argument with you. I'm not gonna do it. - Well, maybe I didn't make $100,000 last year-- - Down, Joe! That was close. - Man. Once the money comes in, just a matter of time, huh? - You know, I've treated you exactly the same way for 15 years. - Yeah, like a 17 year old. - The car, open it. - So just tell me, okay, for the record, just so I know. What were you trying to say in there? - Look, actually it was a compliment if you think about it. - Yeah? - Yeah. - How's that? - Well, you're always telling me how you have to deal with these subcontractors, right? And all these fights you get into. Every day you deal with an element of society that's more, well, it's more -- - Primitive. - Well-- - You mean, like animals. - Yeah, yeah, Joe, like animals. That's what I mean. Like monkeys. That's what you are. Like a big ape in the zoo, you know? - It's not a joke. Yeah. Heavy in the forehead. - I'm not laughin'. A real knuckle-Walker. - Well, your wife doesn't mind having a knuckle-Walker around, does she? - And what do you want to say something like that for? - Well, it's just, shit, you know. The shit hits the fan, and then suddenly I'm welcome in this perfect family's home. And that hasn't happened a whole lot lately, has it'? - Well, you don't have a lot of nights free. - You jealous, Matt? - Are you? - Monopoly? - Takes too long. - Life? - Nobody plays Life anymore. - Yes, they do. - I don't feel like playing a game. - Come on, this is supposed to be fun. - Scrabble, Matt? - Ah, that's too educational. Do we really need that fire? It's like I'm burning up-- - I like the light. - Want to try and keep your clothes on'? - Oh, I'm sorry. What is that one game, you know, where you got to give away your secrets? We played that once, Matt, remember? - I'd rather stick my tongue in a fan, thank you. - We'll pretend like we're in high school, and we got to tell everyone who we wanted to fuck real bad. - Really? - Really. Or how-- Or where. - How is the wine? - Insufficient. - Then I guess Twister's out. - No, I wouldn't say that at all. - Get away from me. Come on, get outta here. - Matt. How much butter do we have? It's all melted. - This is not my beautiful wife. - You used to like my checkered past. - Checkers. We could play checkers. - It's a two person game, Joe. - I need another drink. - Think so? - Yes, I think so. - I know I do. Is he mad? - Well, he's a big boy. He can say so if he is. God, it's like I can't have any fun anymore. - I got it. - Excuse me. - That's a nice picture. - On. - It's funny, I like it. Yeah. - You know, the guy you got doin' your house is really doin' a number on ya. - Oh, I know. He's terrible. - Could have saved you a lot of heartache. Mm-hmm. Know. Screwdriver clatters) - So, uh, how's Carol? - I heard she's fine. - That didn't take long. - Long enough. - You know, there is this thing called marriage. - That's one step closer to death. - Do you know what your problem is? - That's a question I've been hearing a lot lately. I wonder. - You have too many options. - That's a matter of perspective. - I hate you. - Really? It's down there. - No, we don't. Damn it. - No, see, when I get upset, my stomach gets upset. - Oh, you're a pussy. - Hey, what's so funny? - Hey, your dad's here. - Matt, you want a drink? - All right. - Great, run out and loot us some scotch, will ya? - You told him? - What? - You told him! - Well, I'm sorry. I didn't know I wasn't supposed-- - So, when you're out looting tomorrow, I'm a 40 regular, leather cashmere, single breasted. - Shh. - Okay, okay- Looter. - I'm not a looter, Joe. I took what I took to fill a specific need. - So did the guy that took the TV. - TV is not a necessity. - It is if you sell it for food, Matt. - God, you know, I'm sorry. I interrupted something here. You know, and so I'm gonna go back-- - No of course not. We're just-- - Yeah, you did. See, we were talking, and I think your wife thinks-- - Wait a minute. Are you actually gonna stand here in my kitchen and tell me what my wife is thinking? Who the fuck do you think-- - Boys. If you can't play nice, we're not gonna have any more of these little sleepovers. - I'm gonna go outside and have a smoke, all right? - Matt, I'm sorry if-- - Don't. Good night. - Good night. Shit. - Matt? ' Hmm? - There's someone in the house. - What? - Where's the gun? - It's in the living room. Who's in the house? - No, it's not, where the fuck is the gun? - What, what's going on? - Annie, where's the gun? - I threw it in the pool. Why? - Why'd you do that? - Annie, there's someone is the house. - Somebody broke into the house? - I got a bat underneath the-- - Oh my god. - Stay here. - Ready for this? He's just a little guy. I'm gonna go around. You go this way. He's got our money. - Joe? - Leave the stuff! - Hey, turn the fuckin' alarm off! - I said leave the stuff! Leave it! - Turn it off! - Get outta here, get outta here! You see if he has a gun? Joe, Joe, does he have a gun? - I don't know- Oh my God. Hey! - Hey, don't get too close to him! - Joe, look out! - Use your knife! Use your knife! - You okay? You all right? Yeah. - Matt? What happened? - I stabbed him. - You stabbed him? - I think he's still alive. - No, I think I killed him. - You all okay? Huh? How about you? - Get a towel or blanket. Something to stop the bleeding. - He's a little guy. Yeah. That's some wicked switchblade, huh? - You knew he only had a knife? Yeah. Why? Hey, hey, why? What'd he mean by that? - Is he dead? Yeah. - We don't know that. - Hey- We're gonna have a big problem here if you don't have your head screwed on straight. - Save it. That's not important right now! - Listen! The guy's dead, okay? - Oh, my god. - Take Sarah inside. - Oh my god. - Please take her inside. - It's Richard. “ Who? - The guy who works for Mr. Alvarez, the guy who's fixing our kitchen, Matthew. It's Richard. That's your watch. - Please, take her inside. - Did you hear that? - What was it? - It was a shot, wasn't it? - A shot? - It sounded like it was up here. - It was definitely a gunshot. It sounded like it was right outside my window. - You okay? Yeah. He tried to stab me. - I saw it, I saw it. - I think it's that fellow Matthew's place at the end. - I had to protect myself, right? - Matt, what happened? - Uh, somebody broke into our house. And, uh, Steph came out with a rifle and, he, uh-- - Yeah, and this guy was waving this gun around. And he was about ready to shoot one of these guys here. And like Matt said, I come out of my house with my hunting rifle, and I shot him first. There was nothing else I could do. I mean, he was about to take a shot at you, wasn't he? Uh -- - Well, wasn't he? I mean, you got to tell them what happened. - The guy was aiming a gun at you. You got nothing to worry about. - Aw, Jesus Christ. Hey, I'm glad you guys are here man. The guy is dead. - It is what it is. - He had his hands in the air. And he had this gun. - Now hold on, hold on. Stop right there. We heard a gunshot. I want to know who fired it. You telling me that was you? - Well yeah, but what I'm trying to say is-- - Just calm down and tell me what happened. - Okay' I come out of my house, and I had a rifle, and this guy's got his hands up in the air, and I fire, just once, just to put him down on the ground, you know? To take the gun away from him. Yeah, and he stabbed him. - And he probably saved my life. - Yeah, maybe. - Where were you, sir? - Uh, I was standing over by the edge of the driveway. - Is that how you saw it'? - Uh, well, I didn't hear what he said-- - Yeah, well, I was telling him how the guy-- - Just a second, sir! You guys stay here. Come here. " Huh? Oh. T-r-a-s-- - I think under the circumstances, we can save you a lot of time and just return what he took from you right now. - What's gonna happen? - There will be an investigation. Don't worry about your neighbor. He'll stand up fine. The guy was breaking into houses, you all saw him with the gun and the blackout. They'll consider that. Yeah. Is it bad out there? - Out where? - It'll take an hour, and the lights will be on. Who in the hell are they trying to kid around here, huh? - Is that what the cop said? - That's what the cop said. - Upstairs, go on! - No, he said there was a chance that it would go on in an hour. - They don't know any more about when the power's going on than we do. Solar storm, how gullible do they think we are? - Look, it doesn't matter what happened. What are we gonna do to protect ourselves? That's the question. - We should have gated the street when we had a chance. - Oh my God. - The gates again. - Well, we wouldn't have this problem, now would we? You know, sometimes I don't understand you people. I really don't. - I don't wanna live behind bars. I don't understand why you can't see that. - The important thing is that we all stick together. - 1,500 lousy bucks-- - Look, does anybody have any information? I mean, not a rumor, not something they heard from a friend of a friend of a brother, but hard information? Nobody? - We could park a couple of cars, you know, at the end of the block, seal it off. - You know, that's a good idea. - How about that Lincoln of yours? That's a good hunk of steel. - Oh, you thought my Lincoln? - Yeah, why not? - Well, I don't really wan to run down there and move it all the time. - Leave the keys in it. - Are you insane? - What are they talking about? - I'll tell you what I want to talk about. I want to talk about Raji's generator. Hey! - You got a generator? - Well, yeah, but-- - Well, why didn't you tell us? - Why should I? - Well, that's the kind of thing we should know about. I mean, what if some of us have some kind of an emergency? - I have a very limited amount of gasoline. - Well, we can use their own gas, Raji. - Look, you don't understand, it's a very small generator. - Blah, blah, blah. - Blah, blah, blah, what? - Look, look. I don't know how they do things where you come from-- - Miami. - What? - I come from Miami, okay? - What are you saying, Raji? If one of us has an accident, we can't use it? - I didn't say that. - Some of us have kids, you know. - We have kids. - How many? " Two! - Well, we have three. - So what? - I'm just saying. - Look, the important thing is that we all stick together. - good night, everybody. - Right, Ra“. Stick together, rig ht. - But not with your generator and not with his car. Is that about the size of it? - Who the hell is he? - Matt? Hey, Matt. Matt, come here. I just wanna tell you somethin'. Come on. - Take her in. - So what'd you tell the cop? - Doesn't really matter, does it? - Well, kind of matters to me, don't you think? - I lied through my teeth. - Thanks, man. - They'll pull the registration on the gun. They'll trace it to you. - There was no registration on that one. - What do you mean? - I won it in a card game. - You won it in a card... Congratulations. - Hey, whoa, whoa. Easy, 93$)'- Come on. I just want to ask you something. - What? - Where do we stand, you and me? I mean... Do we have a problem now? Okay, I see. I see how we're gonna play this. - Okay' - I'm right across the street, you know. - What about your parents' place in Colorado? - How do we know the power's not out there too? - Well, we don't. It's got to be better than here. - It's really far. - It's not that far. We've driven it before. - Why do you guys want to leave? - It's a little different for us. We got a kid. - So you just want to run away? - It's not running away. - What's the matter with you? - There's nothing the matter with me Joe, it's not safe here. We just saw a guy get killed in my driveway. - Well, I sure am sorry about that. It must be a real strain on you. - That's not what I meant. - Believe me, it's 10 times worse for me. - I'm sure it is. I'm not saying that. - You should just be grateful you didn't get your hands dirty. Now wait a minute, let me make this clear, all right? I feel good about what I did. I acted, Matt. Me and that guy across the street. And you, and you, and your baby are probably alive because I acted, okay? - If that's the way you see it. - How do you... You know what? Tomorrow morning I'm just gonna get lost. - No, no, we're all leaving. All right? All of us. I heard you get up. Do you want to be alone? I couldn't sleep either. What are you thinking? - Nothin' good. Your folks' place is 530 miles from here. We can make it in a day if we drive straight through. We should take my truck. It's got four-wheel drive. You never know if we're gonna need it or not. If we can keep up 20 or so miles a gallon, that means we'll need 26 gallons of gas to get us there. My tank holds 14. And we can siphon some from the other two cars. Keep a can in the trunk. But that means somewhere along the way, we're gonna need another seven gallons of gas. Gas stations aren't gonna be open. Even if they are, they won't sell it to us. And even if they would, we couldn't pay. But along the way, we're gonna have to get our hands on seven gallons of gasoline. Somehow. Hey! Joe! Come on, man. Let's go! They're not gonna work. They were at the bottom of the pool. - It's okay, it's okay. That was nothing. It's okay. - Some of 'em work. Yeah. - Won't do us any good if we don't bring it. - Hey, mind if I drive? - Uh, yeah, kind of. - Come on. It's no big deal. - You drive your car, I'll drive my car. How's that sound? Hi. - Hi. - I don't suppose you have anything cold, huh? - No, I'm sorry, we don't. - All right. Just three sodas, please. - Sure. - Two cheese sandwiches, two warm Pepsi's. I wish we could do better for ya. - Thanks. Come on, hurry up. - Excuse me. - Hey, could I get a glass of water, please? Excuse me. Listen, I've got a little problem. I need some gas. You think I can get some gas from you people? What do you say? - You kiddin'? Our gas? Yeah. I'm kiddin'. I'm a joker. How ya doin'? Name's Gary. - Raymond. - Good to meet ya, Raymond. Yeah. - Listen, you know anything about cars, Ray? - Nope. - Shit, I'm having a little problem with my fuel pump, well, I don't know, something. So you don't know anything at all? - Sorry. - Can you spare a little gas maybe? - Can't do it. - I'll give you 10 bucks for a gallon. - I said I can't. - You can't spare one gallon of gas for $10? That's fight - Well, that's bad business, Ray. How about your friend here? He got a car? - We're together. - I guess I'm just shit outta luck, huh? - Didn't say that. - Yeah, you did. Hey, uh, where's your John at? - In the back. - Somebody's in there right now. - Well, sorry. Who is it, the Pope? - They'll be out in a minute. - You know what, Raymond. I just don't think we're ever gonna be friends. - Free ice cream. Come on, folks, get your ice cream. - We don't really need ice cream. - I do. Hey. - Hi, know what you want? Um-- - I'll have chocolate chip, if you got it. - I'll have a vanilla cone and a chocolate cone. - Slow down! Hey, could you watch her for a second? Yeah. - Thanks. - I'd like two cups. One vanilla-- - One for me? - One strawberry. - Thanks. - Vanilla and strawberry. - Thank you, sir. - You ready? - Look at that. - What? - You live in the middle of nowhere and your house is a piece of shit. And you don't fix it up, you buy a BMW instead? - So? - So who would do that? - Those people. - It's not their car, Matt. - Well no, actually, it's their son's car. See, he went to the city with nothing, made millions. - What are you talking about? - Yeah, he comes back to the house here, come back to help his aged and frightened parents in this terrible time of trouble. - Try this one. BMW guy comes running out of the city, like us, like everybody. Runs out of fuel, no shelter, no food. Sees this farmhouse. Pulls up the driveway, waits, breaks in, kills the farmer. Holds the wife hostage for a couple of years. Lives off their stuff. - Kills the farmer? - Why not? - Let's go, you GUYS- - Are we low already? - No, it's just safer in the tank than in the trunk. Why don't you check the gauge in that car, see if there's any gas we can siphon. - Yeah, that's a good idea. No VIN number. - What? - Little metal identification tab has been cut out. Oh, ah, sorry! Sorry. - What is it? - There's a guy sleeping in the car. - What's going on? - Nothing, I just startled this guy. That's all. - What guy ? - That guy. Hey. How ya doin'? - Hello. - Hello. - What happened? - Boom, that's what happened. Engine blew up on me. Hell, I've been out here all day long. I swear to God, I couldn't get anybody to stop for me to save my life. I just gave up. Went into the car, must have dozed off. - You come from the city? - Yeah, I did. Man, you scared the hell out of me. - Yeah, likewise. - Hey, you think maybe I could catch a ride with you guys'? - Uh, well, we're... - Hey, how ya doin'? - Hi. " Hi! Cute, huh. Uh... You got any room in there? You see, you really would be saving my life. So, uh, come on. What do ya say? - The fact is, we're full up. - Oh, now, you sure? - I think so, yeah. - Yeah, I'm really, really sorry. - How about you? You think so too? - Uh -- - Jeez, it sure must have been hot in that car, cause you look like you've been swimmin' in a pool. Funny thing is, I did the same thing this morning. Dove in the pool and got the, remember? You know what I mean? - He's right, we can barely fit the four of us. - Sorry to hear you say that. - You know what? Let me see what I can do. I'll move some things around, and maybe make some room. - Yeah, yeah, I'd appreciate that, thanks. - What are you doing? - Just hold on, Annie. - I'll just go and get my stuff, okay? I'll be right back. - He's got a gun? That's fight - A gun, he's got a gun. Oh, my God. - shit. - Keep your shirt on. It's gonna be all right, alright? Shh. - Is everything all right? - Yeah! - Just talk to him, Matt. Just stay between him and me. - Didn't change your mind, did you? - Do it, Matt. - Everything okay? - What should I do? - Get on the floor. Stay down. - Yeah, I think it's gonna work. We're gonna put stuff on the top and it should be all right. Hey! - No, don't! You shot him! - Goddamn you! Damn you! - Annie? - Why'd you do that? Why in the hell did you do that, you stupid, stupid shit! Don't touch it! What the hell's the matter with you people? I wasn't gonna do nothin' to you! - Why'd you do that? Why'd you do that? - Does that answer your question, huh? All I wanted was a ride! That's all! Just a ride! You had no right to point this damn thing at me! Not at all! No right at all! - Annie! - Get outta there! Get out of there! Outta the car! - Annie? - Get out of the car! Keep away from her! Don't look at me! Don't look! Don't look at me! You got a baby in a car with a loaded shotgun! Real smart, asshole! You stupid shit, you! You remember who started this! You hear me? You remember! You just remember! That motherfucker fired first! You understand me? He fired first! - Are you okay? Is he okay? - I see another car. - They're not gonna stop. - This one's gonna stop. - No, it's not. No one will stop. - Oh, come on now. Come on, see me here. Come on. Stop, please, come on. Stop, come on, stop! Come on, goddamn it! Stop! Stop! - Matthew, will you move? - Stupid fuck! - Okay, now, what do I do? - Here's your safety right here, alright. The safety's off now. Safety's off, go right to your shoulder tight. Cause this thing's gonna kick. - Tight to my shoulder. - Just pull the trigger. - What if I have to shoot it again? - Alright, you rack it with this hand, on here. You rack it down and back. Alright? - Okay' - Some of these shells work, some of them don't. You just keep racking and pulling the trigger until one of them fires. - Okay' - Okay' All right. So, um, how long are you gonna be gone? - It'll take me about an hour to get to the house. - Are you sure there was a car? Yeah. I saw it. - I want you to come back. Inn- Matthew, I really, really need you to come back. - It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. You're gonna be fine, all right? - Okay' - okay- - Okay- - Okay' - Okay' Oh, god. You're cold. Yeah. - Oh my God, you're freezing. - Yeah, yeah. - Oh, God. - Yeah, I'm cold. - Okay' Is that better? Is that better? You okay? You're gonna be okay. Okay, shh. Shh, shh. - I'm sorry- I'm sorry. - It's okay, it's okay. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - A fly, there's a fly. - It hurts? There's a fly! - There's a fly! - No, no, no, no, Joe! - Thank god. Hello? Hey, hey? Oh, thank god. " Yes? - Listen, my name's Matthew Kay. And we were drivin' and we stopped to help a guy whose car had broken down on the road. He shot my friend, and he stole our car. - Slow down, slow down. - My wife and my baby, we're stranded about five miles back there. He really needs to get to a hospital. Is there any way you could drive us? - You want me to drive you? - Yeah. or could we use your car? I can pay you anything when the power's back on. - You mean, take my car? - Yeah, look, here. Here's my license. - Just hold it up. - Take the whole damn wallet. Do I know you? - No, man, you don't know me. And I don't know you. - Nobody will stop. He took our food and water. - All right. I can give you food and water. - No, wait, wait, wait. - Look, hey. To be honest with you, I don't know if you're lyin'. - You don't know if I'm lying? That's fight - Well, if I was lying, I wouldn't be standing here talking to you, would I? I'd be kicking through your fucking door! - What the hell are you talking like this for? This is not gonna help you. Not gonna help you at all. - This isn't your house. - What? - Whose house is this? - Somebody I know. I don't have to explain myself to you. - Oh, you are full of shit! - Who the hell are you to talk to me like that? - Just let me use your goddamn car, alright? That's all I want! - No, I won't let you use my God... Look man, I can't just hand my car over to the first person that asks. I mean, how the hell do I know that you ain't got somebody waiting in the bushes as soon as I open this door? - Listen man, my friend is gonna die! He's gonna bleed to death in the back of the fuckin' car! - Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I thought you said your car got stolen. - Yeah, the car was stolen, but there's-- - Yeah, all right, like I said, I can give you food. - I don't want the food! A ride, I need a ride! - Man, step away from the door. - What would you do if I pushed my way in here, huh? What would you do then? - I would stop you. - Goddamn it! Oh. - Leave them right where they are. - Oh, shit! Put it down! - You put it down! - Put it down! - You put it down! - You put the fucking gun down! - Put the gun down! - Put the fucking gun down! - Don't make me... No, no, don't load it! Don't load that thing! Stop it! Don't make me... This fucking gun! Don't make me shoot you! - Daddy! Daddy? - Oh, Jesus. - Hey, hey ! Don't point that at her!

Thank you. - You find his card? - Uh, no. - Is that it? - Yeah, yeah, it's right here. - Great. - Joe, we'll be right behind you. - Okay, and ready? One, two, three. - Hello? Yeah. - Bartholomew gazed at his glistening town. Maybe something got lost, but something got found. He'd seen such amazing, mysterious things. He'd seen horses with glasses and canyons that sing. Made all sorts of new friends on the head of a pin. Played a weird game of baseball where the winners don't win. But the biggest adventure he knew lay ahead. All the dreams he could dream in the warmth of his bed.
