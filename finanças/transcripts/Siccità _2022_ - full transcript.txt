DRY ROME WILL MAKE IT CONCERT PROCEEDS AND DONATIONS WILL FUND DRINKING WATER FOR DISADVANTAGED CITIZENS - Hello! - Hi, welcome! Giulia, darling! - Valerio? - Yes. It's beautiful, isn't it? - It's amazing. - Armando? - Welcome! - This is Valerio. - Armando. - Hi. My hands are dirty. Fabrizio and Emiliana. - Pleasure. - Hi. Let me show you the house. Medium rare for everyone and well done for the new mom? - Thank you! - I got the onesies and rompers for you. - Really? - Yes. Darling, you shouldn't have! They don't fit Justin anymore, I'd like you to have them. Here's the walk-in wardrobe, where I also keep my gym gear and towels. Here's the open kitchen, with the island and induction cooker. And here... Justin is sleeping with Daiana. There he is. Mommy's little boy! Here is the master bedroom, with a small en suite bathroom. Amazing! Isn't it? Yeah, it's amazing. And here is the main bathroom, which is pretty much only used by Armando. Let me check if there's water. - Good. - We have it from 9 to 11 at night. Now let's eat. - What's going on? - Clashes. They gave me six crates. I have friends at the warehouse. You can't find this in supermarkets. I spoke to the guys, and we arranged it. - Fabio will follow you the first few days. - Thanks, it's terrific. We're a good team. You've worked in a team, right? - Me? - You spoke about a gym. Did you do full contact? MMA? Yeah. Well, actually... He was mainly a personal trainer. He had a line of ladies like this. Well, I'd believe it! The owner took advantage of him. He called him a partner, but... Valerio is just too good. But he's managed businesses. Tell them, darling! Yeah, I've had a couple of business ideas. Like a tattoo parlor. Interesting! No? - And... - An e-cigarette store. They didn't go well, but it wasn't his fault. - Valerio is a hard worker. - Armando told them! He told them he's good and wants to work. Stefania cared a lot so I went out on a limb. - Thanks. - Thank you. No worries, I'm happy to help. And old Zarate trusts me. Zarate is the boss, but he loves Armando like a son. I'm taking on a big responsibility. Thank you, thanks so much. Maybe try not to stutter too much. Come on, Armando! You'll get on well, we're like a family. Fantastic. What happened? Riccardo? Riccardo. Darling, you tried, that's enough. Oh my God! Are you ok? - He left. - Yeah, I saw. - Here, I'll drive. - Get in. It's fine, get in. Excuse me, I need to use the bathroom. Where... Go to the main bathroom, Armando's. You remember, right? God, sorry. Thanks. Your man is cute. So sweet. Are you leaving? - Yes. - Good for you. A friend from the City Council got us... This sucks! What the fuck do you want? Fuck this! Go fuck yourself! Seba, I was worried about you! I rang you 200 times! Did those fucking guards get you? How'd it go? Tell me! - How many were there? - Get off me. You're all cut! Bastards... But you got away. - Did you hit them back? - Got a few kicks in. You rock! Come on. Filippo, keep me posted, please. Here. It's all yours. Bye! Bye. Are you ok? Yeah. Doctor! Three burn victims, hemorrhages, stomach aches, food poisoning. As well as the usual hypochondriacs. Here's tonight's menu on the tablet. And there's something really strange. Eight more with a high fever and asthenia. Eight more? We isolated them. We waited for you to assess them. - Transaminase levels? - Very high. Have you spoken to relatives? Where had they been? Had they traveled? He was sick, he was drowsy, shaking. I told him to stay home and not come to rehearsal. - We'll take a look. - Thanks. - Excuse me, you can't be back here. - One minute! Please, this way. Fucking hell! - Come and see us. - Of course, thank you. - It was great! - It was, thanks again. - Thank you. - Thanks. - I'm sorry you can't come. - You were wonderful. - Are you joking? - It was nothing! - Thank you. - Valerio, remember, stay strong! When you can give, you give, and when you can take, you take! Thanks, bye! Thanks. Stefania is nice. But Armando, I dunno... He's boring, no? He seems like a nice guy to me. And generous. - We had a good time. - Let's go home. Thanks to the work of the Civil Defense... - This way. - And the Municipal Police... Today we have the opportunity to show our audience... - Entry only with a badge! - Images of the discovery. The 30 meter statue was on a pedestal... ...the precious metal had been reused. Here's the amazing find. After the destruction of the Domus Aurea, it was rebuilt by Vespasian. An amazing discovery, look. It should be said that here there is a strong smell of decay. Hurry up, the smell is making me sick. Day 367 of the water crisis in Rome. The countdown continues and we're less than 12 days away from the total closure of public water supplies. Anger is added to the distress. Further clashes tonight, with damage to cars and shops, and another serious fire in the hills of Monte Mario. We are now joined from Padua by Professor Del Vecchio, thank you. - Hello. - Hello. Every day, the drought seems to have more dramatic effects on the daily lives of the people of the capital. How should the authorities respond? You all ask me the same question, but there isn't a single answer. There are many challenges in Rome. Firstly, the losses... Antonio! - Guys. - Shut up! We're talking about dispersion of almost 70%. It's the old habit of over-consumption. For sure! Wash your hands with the gel, like the warden said. Smells like shit. Why don't you use soap? The company dry washes them, it's trichloroethylene. Shut up, you idiot! How stupid is Antonio? Shut up! Now, aside from the impact... It's been almost three years without rain. It should have been known that supplying four million people with cheap, unlimited water... would end up having dramatic consequences. - Thank you, Professor. - Bye, Antonio! Today in Municipality 11, the water supply will be on from 11 to 12 and from 19 to 20. When the supply is on, it is strictly forbidden to take a supply of over five liters per capita. We're fed up with your bullshit! Keep ringing! I've paid all my bills! Bastards! Shove your fines up your ass! Bastards! Car washing is prohibited... Hey! What are you doing? Stop! Stop! I didn't do anything! Aggressive interventions by law enforcement should not be necessary. Now is not the time for intolerance. We need decency, caution, respect and humility. We need to show thanks for all those who are striving around Italy, around the world, and please, let's forget the controversy. Give no thought to bad jokes or schadenfreude, or to the malicious joy of those who couldn't wait to vent their resentment towards the capital. We must show respect for the Umbrian and Tuscan farmers, who see tankers taking water from their streams. Their objections are understandable. We can't let our worries become anger, road blocks, more violent clashes, more arrests... Romans are called on to use their ancient grace, everyone doing the right thing in their own small way, which is to limit consumption and not mess around. We use the water that belongs to us without straining the supply, which sometimes seems to happen. Now I'll leave you with words from a Brazilian writer. "A responsible warrior is not someone who takes the world's weight on his shoulders, but one who's learned to deal with the challenges of the moment." WATER FOR ALL ROME WILL MAKE IT How was it, my love? Did you hear? - Very nice! - What are you doing? Pouring the leftover tea on the rose hip. If only I could save you... Be honest, you were shocked by the Coelho quote. Your Annie Ernaux would not work. Sure! Better that way, well done. 300 shares already! How many seconds was that? I can tell, my love, when you're not convinced, you know? What are you doing? He got in late again last night. If he was up late, we should let him sleep. He's 16! I'm on 9-17 today, but they might ask me to do a second shift. Really? To hell with them. I told them to, because after eight, it's overtime, with a 50% increase on... The water bottles are empty, I'll try and bring more. There's a case of tonic water. If I'm home late, there's puntarelle and yogurt in the fridge. - You're a star! - You too! OPENING MY EYES AND THINKING OF YOU RUNNING TO WORK AND THINKING OF YOU Oh my God... Got ya! Here we are. How much did we pay for the hotel? 30% off for water supply's interruptions. START ROUTE It's hot. Ok. Ready. It stinks in here. My mask. It's a mess in here. Korea? Beautiful! Asshole! We speak also Korean here. Is he sleeping? Hey, man! - Antonio! - No, Simone. I spoke with the judge. There's a very good chance we can request house arrest. But I don't have a house. We'll get you a place in shared accommodation. Assistant! Just make the request, we'll do the rest. I have to deliver the laundry, I'm on duty in the kitchen, I promised Father Luigi I'd serve mass... I'm up to my eyes. Antonio, no one serves 25 years in Italy! You're very kind, Simone, thank you. Will you guys tell him? Antonio! Come on, Antonio, hurry up, it's late. Come on. Go. Vincenzo, don't forget, watch that video online. It's powerful. - Come on. - Let's go. They always play these jokes. Hey, I'm inside! Hey! What are you doing? What are you doing? Are you crazy? What's that? Hey! You shut me in! - Look who's here! - We loaded him on! Antonio, what are you doing here? Did you hide? - No, you locked me in... - Sure! - Won't you bring me back? - It's right there, let yourself in! Let myself in? They love you, they'll take you back, don't worry. See you, Antonio! RIDE TAKEN BY MARCELLO77 Hombre! - Well, how are things? - No... I see you downloaded the new app. Good, get busy, go for it! Loris, your family? Your daughter? How much are you making a month? It would take a pension fund to safeguard workers like you, Loris! I raised the point at the last Council of Ministers. - Mr President, please... - Why so formal? You and I were friends! Anyway, Loris, we've done the deregulations and if you have this opportunity now, it's thanks to my government. They even told me it was right wing, you know? But what about the civil unions? The schools? The digital bonus, the Mini Jobs... I know all that, but I also know, Mr President, that you resigned, so... They made me step down because of bogus investigations, and all the fake news they put up on the web! - Don't forget that. - God forbid! Now we just need to reassemble our strengths, a great alliance of all the progressives and the non progressives too, especially the non progressives. Follow me, Loris. Who can I follow, Mr President? Who can I follow, given you're... My God... For drowsiness, mineral salts, strong sodium capsules, two potassium capsules, and papaya and guarana. - You mentioned fever and chills? - Yes, but I was 36.5 when I checked. It goes up to 37. I'm worried about dozing off. Add activin, carnitine, arginine, vitamins B, C, D, magnesium and those wipes. - Thanks. - I'll take the same as her. - That'll save you a trip. - 172.85 euro. - Morning, Rosa. - Morning. - Last night's admissions. - Thanks. - Sorry to interrupt. - Yes? I want to inquire about a patient, Riccardo D'Argenzio. I brought him in yesterday. They won't let me in. "D'Argenzio"... Just a moment. - Just let him know I'm here. - Sure. Morning, Doctor, excuse me. Doctor Maltese from infectious disease is looking for you. Why aren't you on maternity leave? - Why are you waiting? - I leave in two weeks. Thanks, Doctor, I'm well. There he is. Excuse me. - Hi, beautiful Della Rocca! - I'm off, see you tomorrow. Bye, Sara. Was it you who ordered the lumbar punctures? Why are you giving me that look? Because they're expensive, we can't do them on everyone. We can do one, just one, on a single patient. Are we looking for a tropical disease? We're not in Brazil or Africa. I think we are. Let's remove any doubt, a thorough serology test. Only because I have a soft spot for you. - Go on, Maltese! Try harder! - Are you giving me permission? Sure, just let me know everything right away. Provisions of over five liters per capita are prohibited. A reminder that today the supply... Can I take a shower? Mom, they changed to 12 to 14, but I left you half a tank. I washed like a cat and there was half left over. - Why are you at home? - Rehearsals all day today. Dad's taking me, so we can eat together. I just ordered the headlight for the car, you owe me a fortune. - Fine. - I was joking! Didn't you have a hearing? - I'm leaving now. - Cool. The concert is tomorrow. Are you coming? Of course we are. What concert? I can set some tickets aside for you. It would be good to bring some cash, because it's a charity thing, but don't feel obliged. Sorry, I'm exhausted, I need to sleep. Bye, Sara, my love. I'm off! Did you sleep in my bed? That would be our bed. You were gone and it smelled like you. That's gross. Poor guy! Why won't you talk to her? Tell her, "Sara, my love, I messed up, I see that, but let's get back together for the good of the child." Mom, please, I'm begging you. Listen to your mother. A man can't be alone. - Work isn't everything. - No. And "work"... What work is this? I could understand the one before. Man, it was high-profile! The Chigi Palace, heads of state... Then they cut the state cars. What was I to do? They made the decision. They decided they were expensive. Did I decide it? No. Come on, Dad, she's enough on her own. You don't need to work together. She's enough on her own. Don't both of you piss me off. One moment! Mine. There are 12 bottles. You'll have to put a pack back, please. One is for me and one is for my aunt. You'll have to put them through separately and pay with two different cards. Come on, we always come here, we even have the loyalty card! Show some kindness! I'm sorry. What a pain in the ass! You're right. - Can you give me a bag, please? - Sure. IT WILL BE WONDERFUL TO WALK IN THE SNOW WITH YOU Can we pay now? - Yes, sorry. - There's a queue. It's 42.80 euro. Card? Yes. ONE NEW VOICE MESSAGE Oh God, I'm sorry. A deserved homage to a great name of Italian culture, in a stunning location in the capital, the Teatro India, a hotbed of talent, a factory of theater workers. - Hey, guys! All good? - Hello. - Hi. - Hey, good morning, Alfredo. - Hi. - Massimo is waiting for you. Thank you. It's a great honor, I can't wait. - Here we are. Come on! - Hi, Alfredo. Here we are! Lots of friends, but most of all, a shout out to the great maestro, and dear friend, Massimo. - Hi, Massimo! - Please, turn that thing off. Sure. It was just to let some people know about your show. Great post today, Alfredo, very important. Thanks. Great job, Livia! Alfredo, did they tell you already? Come here. Vannoli dozed off on stage yesterday, and he's getting hospitalized today. He was Stockmann? I know it by heart, I did it with a company in Genoa. In Genoa. In Rome, I play Stockmann. Vannoli played Aslaksen. Aslaksen? The printer? Yeah, the printer! Alfredo, Aslaksen is a great role! We adapted it a bit, but don't worry, the character is there. Let me think about it, I'm kind of tied up at the moment. Tied up with what? You're not doing anything. They told me Mila had to get a job at a supermarket and you're always playing on fucking social media. Massimo, what does it matter? With all that's happening, we have to show our faces! It's important stuff! Livia says so too, right? Isn't that right, Livia? Alfredo, I believe in you. You have to realize that in theater economics, Aslaksen's eight lines are very important. Sorry, but in the original he didn't have eight lines! He has eight now. Come on, we'll give you Vannoli's script! You're a good friend, Alfredo! Come on, up, let's go. Ladder, frame, let's restart rehearsals. I want to show you... It's all here? Thanks. Here we are. Crooks! Sorry, what's going on? There's a bit of unrest. - This is the hotel? - Nice, right? There's even a thermal spa. Valle Aurelia has been under a regime for months... Calm down, don't go crazy. It's outrageous! I packed magnesium for you. It's all fountains, hot springs, pools... Around 80,000 liters a day, while civil committees protest outside. - No wonder. - You should see my room. Come on, Rome is a beautiful city, enjoy it! They're calling. Did you pack mosquito repellent? Yes. They're stinging. - Oh no. In the wash-bag. - I'll call you later, bye. Welcome, very nice to meet you. They told me at reception that there's a problem. Miss, I can't stay here. The people outside are angry. How does this reflect on me? Apologies, Professor. A small hotel near the studios would be fine. I'll tell production and we'll move you as soon as possible. Just have some patience for today. We thought we'd get you to the studio an hour early, so you can get makeup done. - The hairdresser... - "Hairdresser"? It's the news, not prime time TV song context, right? Top floor. Fuck you. It is strictly prohibited to take a supply of over five liters per capita. - Seba! - Come in. - Are your parents home? - No, don't worry. What a house! I knew you were a billionaire. All these books, even in boxes! Have you read all of them? No, Mom used to have a bookstore. - And now? - She closed it. You've a nice place. Let me see what you eat. Knew it, you radical chic are always on a diet. Did you write it? - No. - Why not? I did all the editing, even the videos from the other phones! You're the one that's good at writing. "We used to wage war against each other, but now we're allied and united. We're an institution without borders or outdated barriers. Right, left... We are the people! The disgraceful cops couldn't stop the force of so many young people fighting against the deaf and blind establishment, they're establishing a dictatorship with the excuse of the crisis. This is the last draw!" - "Straw", Lino. - Should I do it again? Keep going, you were doing well. - Right, you've written a masterpiece! - Enough with the kisses. Sorry, I love you too much. Finger food and healthy juice, counter-current swimming, relax area with herbal tea. - One. - Here you go. We have to supervise the whole spa. The pools need to be protected from water thieves, and vandalism from these assholes. Can you hear them outside? But most of all, the safety of the Zarate family. Armando tells me you're trained in martial arts. I'll put you with Raffaella today in my place, at most you'll have to take the cucquean to the pharmacy, the psychologist, or home. Cucquean? There are those assholes again! Give me a hand! Sons of bitches! Come here! Sorry, what is it that? Don't worry. Get it! Knock it down! They take public water and heat it! The water is for those who pay bribes and then get exemptions! The Zarate Group is doing its dirty business with us! Put them here, turned off. Give us back our water! End this! Shame on you! I offered Del Vecchio a suite through the network press office. Well done, darling. Smart move, right, Dad? If such a credible person stays with us, public opinion... They want to know where we get our water. Let's tell them. Where do we get our water, Dad? My dear, our 80,000 cubic meters aren't the problem, they've lost millions. We've become the focus of an ideological dispute. Exactly. Let's insist we have to safeguard jobs. Would we send 180 families home? We can do a counter-move. Let's hire, find new staff... Good, darling. I think that's genius. We're not just sold out, but we have bookings for another 90 days. At least people can wash in peace here. We'll denounce those who say there's no thermal spring here. Right. We could bottle and sell water, but we give it to customers for free. - They should make a monument to us. - You're right. He's right, it's true. But there's no... There's no thermal spring here. Along with the thermal spring, we have our private supplies. We'll say the resort doesn't use public water. Who's going? - Well, Pierluigi can do it, Dad. - Will I? Claudio. If you want, I'll do it. - No, she'll do it. - Me? - Yes, darling. - No, Dad, send Pierluigi. At least send Azzurra, she's better. I'm not able. You can do it. I don't even know what needs to be said. We don't use public water. - Go on. - You can do it, honey. Go on. "We don't use public water." What water do we use, Dad? Not public water. - I say that and come back. - Good. She'll get more pity. Come on, Dad, that's mean! The poor thing. Are you new? - And Fabio? - I'll be with you today, Ma'am. - The cucquean's coming. - Give back our water! - We've been waiting all day! - Guys, please! She's here! You didn't expect this, did you? Tell us something! So, I came here... to talk with you. Let's talk! What I would like to say first and foremost is that we do not use public water. WE CAN DRINK YOUR SWIMMING POOLS You have some nerve! Water tankers come every day. Oh, yeah? - We don't believe you! - From Calabria and from Abruzzo. Tell your little stories in front of everyone. Where are these tanks? Believe... Believe me, for the thermal spa, we don't use a single drop of the public supply. We have built our own piping network which draws sea water directly, which is then purified and desalinated. It's sea water. Brilliant. It's amazing what you came up with. It's what we need to do. I'm reading the WaterWorld project, it's this Israeli study... - Reading? - Yes, they printed it for me. Thank you. Look. It has very high costs. We'll discuss it again when we come back from Milan. Thanks, Dad. Don't crowd! Form a nice line, please! - Do you not have a container? - No. Do you want one? Here, this one holds ten liters. Thanks, but I don't have my wallet. - I left without... - It's free! It was donated by the Province of Sondrio! It's all good! The Civil Defense helped us, a gesture of solidarity! Come with me. I'll help you, you don't seem able. Put it there, under the tap. Don't put your fingers over it, it's drinkable. It's from the Valtellina valley, it's good! - One container per family. - Do you need this water? Because they give us a container per head. If you don't need it, you'd be doing me a favor. We could help each other out, maybe... I just told you the water is good, and you wash yourself? Get out of here! The issue, then, is to educate from elementary to high school to not take water for granted. To teach respect for water. - It concerns everyone. - We can't make coffee. No, I was looking for a telephone. A telephone? A pay-phone. A what? Actually, I need a directory. - A directory? - A telephone directory. If you let me borrow it, I'll bring it back right away. Jolanda? Do we still have any of those old directories anywhere? They stopped sending them years ago. Actually, I'm looking for... Scozza, Maria Giulia, or else Accatino, still Maria Giulia, that's her mother's surname. I don't understand, is she here? Her grandparents were here in San Lorenzo, our house was in Magliana, 6, Via Giuseppe Capaldo, door 10, but I don't know if she's still there, the house might not even be there anymore. I wanted the telephone directory to find her new address. Do we realize we're wasting drinking water to, excuse the term, to pull the toilet chain? I'm sorry, but it's one of many activities that is no longer sustainable. - Good morning. - That's right, actually. Look at the example of... The ancient town used to have... Did you look on Facebook or Google? Yeah. Would anyone be willing to be filmed? We want to show people how you're living during the water crisis. Is anyone available for an interview? Someone communicative, who speaks well. There's an asylum seeker from Mali who speaks Italian well. Can you get Sembene? He's very good. We helped him in the past and now he's helping us. He told incredible stories of how shepherds of his ethnicity use water. Here he is. - This is Sembene, he's very good. - Hey. We'd like to interview you for a minute. - We're going on air this evening. - Ok, what do I have to do? - What's your name? - Where's Francesca? Jacolucci, from the store on Via Germanico. Jacolucci, Giampiero. The business is closed now for various reasons. - Good afternoon. - Afternoon. If you'd like my point of view, I'm available. Ok, prepare for half a minute. We're going on air this evening. - Half a minute? - Yeah. Give your thoughts on the times we're going through. Feelings, fears, hopes, but keep it concise. Thanks. Thank you. Sir, since I'm running low on these cards at the moment... - I'll give it back later. - Sure. Excuse me, can you give us your phone number? My phone is charging. So you won't be able to reach me. Once it's charged, I'll give it to you. - Half a minute? - Half a minute. - Half a minute? - Or less. - Or less? - Yeah. Maltese, talk to me. What was confirmed? Trypanosomiasis? How many did you take samples from? All of them? All positive? I'm on my way. Why all the journalists? - Doctor! - Did you have a hunch? Were they quarantined? - Is it sleeping sickness, an epidemic? - How did you know? - Is it a result of the drought? - Is it contagious? Why don't you ask my colleagues? They told us you figured it out. Is it the tzetze fly? What's the mortality rate? Did you hear? - Yes. Where's Maltese? - This way. - There she is. - Excuse me. Your results. Fuck! If there's a relative, have them sign the consent form. - Has there been a first death? - Two more are... - Did you sleep here? - Well, "sleep"... - I'm sorry. - It's nothing. You need to sign the consent form for the autopsy. Autopsy? - A postmortem? - Yes. Sign here. You're a relative, right? No, I don't exist. His wife and son are over there. - Goodbye. - Bye. You burst into my heart Out of nowhere I don't know why WONDERFUL TO SEE SOMEONE TAKE CARE OF WHAT THEY LOVE DESPITE ALL THE NONSENSE NORMS #LOVE EVERYTHING Hey! Come on! Come on, come on. Come on, that's better. Come on, come on. Loris, I know this is a messed up time for the capital and for the whole country, but you shouldn't indulge into self-destructive acts. You need to have faith, Loris. You need to look forward. The future, Loris. The future! With the proper alliance, a good coalition, very broad... Mr President, you're dead. I was presumed dead after the regionals. Why did you kill yourself... in such a... horrible way? There have been difficulties, but why all this pessimism? The funeral... was tough. Very sad. I cried. I cried for a dickhead whom, deep down, I loved. Ok, Loris, I understand the criticism, we're a democratic party, it's all good, but still, do you remember the G7? Taormina? We gave Merkel a ride that night. Then we had cannoli with fruit and ricotta. - It was wonderful, Loris! - Enough. - Didn't we have fun? - Yes, but leave me be now. Leave me be. Leave me be. I had a moment of crisis, as happens to many business owners, but I came back straight away, I refurbished the shop and the warehouse. The bank requested immediate repayment! Can you believe it? Even the Revenue Agency got involved. I have the documents. They're here, I'm not talking crazy. Will this bloodthirsty state give me time to bounce back? To make some money? I hired a brilliant lawyer, from the best firm in Rome. He had me appeal to the Supreme Court right away. He says we'll get back everything they owe us, everything they took! That money is mine! They have to give it back! No, that's no good. I had the line about America. America, America... America... Here it is. If a business owner has a problem in America, he ends up under a bridge, but that can't happen in Italy, because he has support from his family. My family stabbed me in the back! My family, my relatives! There's no need to cry, everyone cries on television. Take some water from your own five liter canister, which we sterilize by bringing to the boil, but you should only add enough to go three fingers over the pasta. Strain it on time and you'll have pasta, al dente. Mix it all together and... we'll take the rest of the water, let me show you where. We use the left-over water to flush after we use the toilet. Make sure to adjust the flow from the tap... The show will continue on YouPorn! I knew it! Mila! WITTY AND FUNNY TUTORIAL BY THE WELL-KNOWN ACTOR Mila! What are you doing? "Sick of it all, only horror, misery and hypocrisy, only anguish. Goodbye, my shitty fancy-ass friends. Goodbye, my shitty family." Well, darling, I wrote terrible things when I was a boy. Didn't you? It's normal. I don't know. There's blood here too. Darling, you're obsessing over this boy. And sorry, I came to tell you about my tutorial. Your what? It's on the homepage of Repubblica.it! You're going to say, "Who cares?" But maybe you're wrong. It's important to try and do something, to put yourself out there. Now what I say to these people carries a bit of weight! Go on. "I love creeks and the music they make. And rills, in glades and meadows, before they have a chance to become creeks. I may even love them best of all for their secrecy. I almost forgot to say something about the source!" His name was Giuseppe. He was kind, shy, he came from Sicily. No one noticed him lying down, because, worn out from thirst, he drank water from a drain. He was poisoned and died without anyone noticing. Apart from you who do everything you can, where are the authorities in this tragic situation? We are alone. People here have different backgrounds, some have mental health issues. There are those who look for our help and those who come here for refuge or to connect to the Wi-fi or... Or else we look for them ourselves and we give out care packages, a sandwich, a bottle of water, an apple... Fabrizio, we'd also like to hear some live testimonies. Of course, Sembene is here with us. No, sorry. Sembene. Sembene has been in Italy for two years, waiting for his asylum application to be granted. Sembene is from a savanna between Mali and Senegal which is becoming desert. My people are nomadic shepherds who have lived with drought for millennia. Our farming chases the rain. If it rains, we sow our seeds. We harvest millet shoots before they dry out. We manage to do herding and farming with only two or three rainfalls a year. What do you think, at this moment, the response of the authorities should be? I don't know, but I do know what people should do, how to use water. Wash yourself without waste, and wash food and vegetables and use that water for your crops. Our traditions teach us that water is a living thing, a gift from God that we should safeguard with patience and love. It would be great to have him in studio, wouldn't it, Professor? - Let me know when I'm on. - Perfect, we're done. That went over time, we're done. Could you come tomorrow? We could send you a car? Give us your phone number and your address. REMEMBER? INSTEAD OF GOING TO CLASS, WE RAN AWAY TO THE CINEMA I'M NOT THE SAME PERSON ANYMORE GIVE US NAKED AMIDEI! THIS SUCKS! SURE, IT SUCKS WHEN YOU HAVE TO MAKE A BIT OF EFFORT YOU MAKE ME SICK. I'M DELETING MY ACCOUNT, I WON'T MISS YOU ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT TO DELETE YOUR ACCOUNT? CANCEL Fuck off! What the hell! He's never here! Does he say anything? Speak? Communicate? Where is he? You said we should get off his back! There's a limit! There are limits! Your post with the Carver poem was beautiful. It's already a wonderful poem, but the way you read it... - You think? Wasn't it too... - It was beautiful, don't feel bad. Feel bad? About that bullshit? Mom, I saw you haven't liked my Carver post! Tell her I say hi. Sure, like I didn't notice when you posted those hearts for the Malaysian kid, like everyone else did. - All at his feet. - Malian. Malian, the Malian kid, but he actually copied what I did in my tutorial. Was that by chance? - Mom? - Yes, darling? Can I call you back? Something big is happening. LOOK WHAT I FOUND ISN'T SHE ALFREDO AMIDEI'S WIFE? SHE WON'T GET AWAY WITH IT YOU'RE GOING TO PAY FOR EVERY LAST DROP I KNOW HER, SHE'S A BITCH! WHAT A PAIR OF HYPOCRITES! YOU'VE NO IDEA HOW MUCH I LOVED YOU Alfredo! - What have you done? - What have I done? You want to ruin me, don't you? Why do you want to ruin me, why? It's not what you think, Alfredo! No... Wait! Let me explain, Alfredo! Is this the one? Not my hair! Professor, you have a nice messy style, but I think it would be better if we styled it a little, no? For sure. You TV people are all crazy! - A little bit. - Ouch! There are increasing cases of African trypanosomiasis or sleeping sickness, usually caused by pathogens typical of the sub-Saharan area, but the suspicion is that there is a link with the water crisis in Rome. Professor, can I ask, is this connection possible? It seems clear to me that a change in the ecosystem is occurring. The dying off of fish in the Tiber who feed on insect larvae and eggs means the hunter is gone, leading to an increase in insects. So could it be the tzetze fly? That I don't know, but if there is a disease, there's also a carrier. Look, climate change, deforestation, over-use of resources, drainage of rivers... Mom, come and watch! Is it Dad? Look! - Look! - Jesus Christ. No! Look at the state of him. What have they done with his hair? It looks like he's wearing a fur hat, Mom! Congratulations, the Minister would like to meet you. - We have a car for you. - What minister? It's not at the Viminale. It's a lovely setup. If you'd like to follow us... - Your bag. - Yeah, thanks. For your accommodation, I have two options to show you. - Not now. - Professor... Hello, Carla? Why are you laughing? Look at you! Why are you laughing? Come on, come on... Oh my God. Tell me why you're laughing! CLOSED UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE The fuck are you looking at? Forgive me, forgive us all. Hi. Good. Well... Yeah... It's nice to hear my voice. I meant yours. Right. Wonderful. Yes. THAT WAS POWERFUL IT WAS FOR ME AS WELL I WANT TO SEE YOU TOMORROW? Excuse us. Please, this way. Excuse us. - Minister? - Yes? - Here he is. - Nice to meet you. Well done, it's vital we have you on the emergency task force. - Thanks for accepting. - I accepted? They tell me your book foresaw all of this. We need people like you to spread confidence. I really only made predictions about catastrophes. Measures must be taken, otherwise... And they will be, we'll take these measures, with your contribution. Let's set up some accounts and a fan page for him. - We'll keep you up to date. - This way. We have the senator's birthday, the red carpet... May I? I'm honored. What are you doing here? At my house? You're right, I never find time to enjoy my nest. Well, it's a beautiful nest. So? What future awaits us? It's not just climate change that worries me, but us, our humanity... What will we become? I'm just a specialist. I focus on specific questions. You seem like the only serious person in a world of crooks, narcissists and mythomaniacs. I know it's incorrect to use ice, but if we have to die, I'd rather die drunk. You'll never die, you're immortal. I'd really like to talk with you, but without all this mess around us. Come and see me, if you can. I'll write my number. Instead of taking action against the rich and the politicians, who pay the price of gold for water to have their jacuzzies, they move against us who fight to defend our streets, and our grandmothers who go shopping, am I right? Yeah! Who's thinking of us? They resent us, they point their fingers at us. While the rich do what they want, helped by the establishment, we are dying. They're all friends of mine, I'll introduce you when we're done. Come on. I won't give up I won't give up Carletta, darling, I saw I missed loads of your calls, I'm sorry. It was a never-ending night! I was afraid you'd been drugged. With that hair... No, no, I was fine. I've been running all over the place since this morning! I met the Minister, the meeting... I'm exhausted, I can't wait to jump into bed. Sleep well. It all went well. I mean... No, they're all nice. Fabio... The guys... The resort is awesome. What's she like? Dunno, normal. She's strange. Is she normal or strange? Should I be jealous? Are you joking? Come on. Babe, I promise, look, I'm going to hold on to this job. Day 368 of the water crisis in Rome and we're just 11 days away from the closure of public water supplies. He found out what's happening to this city which is dying from thirst and sleep. Give me the water! Come back here! Come here! Give me the water! Who are you looking for? Accatino... Maria Giulia. Or Scozza. Are they here? Dunno, it's just us. Excuse me... Accatino? - Accatino? - Accatino, yes. They haven't lived here for a while. A while? He died, the poor man, and Anna is in a nursing home. - And Maria Giulia? - The granddaughter? I know she goes to see her. But where is she now? Wasn't she in one of the squats near the market? - Could be. - Squats? Along the river, right down, cross the bridge to the other side, and the market is there. Thank you. Poor thing, he seems like a fool. He looks exactly like him. [FOREIGN DIALOG] DAUGHTER - MISSED CALLS: 6 Fuck... DAUGHTER - ONGOING CALL - Where were you? - Darling! I'm sorry, I fell asleep last night. I know that... I know, what can I do? Let's get some lunch together. I'll come and get you later. Well done, darling. Tell the girl to speak with her mother, so she can tell her how much you love her. Mom, Martina isn't a girl anymore. Yes, of course she is... - Sara left me. - But... Yes, she got remarried to a lawyer. Well... - He's a graduate, she's a graduate... - That doesn't mean anything. It's normal. What was she doing with me? - What do you mean? - I don't believe that. You were always kissing each other. It can't end like this. You're right, Dad, it can't end like this. It actually ended a long time ago. - That's not true! - It wasn't your fault. You had nothing to do with it, you gave everything. I'm the problem. - No! - Yes. - No! - I'm the problem and that's that. - No! - Yes. - No! - I'm telling you yes. - No! - I'm telling you yes! I'm the problem! If I say that I'm the problem, why do you say I'm not? I'm the problem. Hey! I'm the problem! Why do I have to convince you? Enough! Enough! Do you know Scozza, Maria Giulia? Accatino... - Containers between five and ten liters. - Scozza, Maria Giulia... Please, one container per family. Does anyone know Scozza, Maria Giulia? Or Accatino, Maria Giulia? Scozza, Maria Giulia? - Accatino? - Make an orderly queue! - Wait your turn! - Is the queue for water? Do you want to sell yours? This is good, it's from Sondrio, the Valtellina valley. If that's true, I'll give you ten euro. Do you know Scozza, Maria Giulia? - Or Accatino? - Who? Accatino, Maria Giulia, Scozza... I was told her maternal grandparents lived in the squats here. - I live in the squats. - Do you know her? You from another neighborhood? You've no respect! - He's right! - Knock it off! MARKET CLOSED DUE TO LOW STOCK What's going on here? Go back where you came from! It's a dictatorship! Make your voices heard! You need patience. Good morning, sir. How are you? Here we are, finally! You look great, very elegant. We're on our way to court. - Any updates on the appeal? - The what? What do you mean? The appeal, no? - Still? - Still? You told me you'd had a brilliant idea. How did you put it? There was a technicality. We could have requested an appeal in the Supreme Court. We filed the appeal, it was turned down. We lost in the Supreme Court. - It's Scotch, original. - That's not necessary. No, you must accept, for your father. I'll take the price tag off, I had left it on. Do you remember the shirts I made for your father? Who does he get them from now? Give me a break! Who the fuck does he get them from now? OUT OF WATER Dad, you're a disaster. I know, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm really sorry. I think our pizzeria is closed. I know, they're pretty much all closed. Will we go for a drive and stop at the first one we find? Who will we find? Aren't there restrictions? There's always someone who disobeys! No, I have two pizzas in the fridge. Are you saying I'm gonna set foot in the forbidden house? Here we are. You finished your container, I'd have washed up if not. There's no need, sweetheart. Anyway, we have loads of containers. - Careful, it's hot. - All good? - Yeah. I'll put it here. - Ok. Get away. What... Smells good! So the conductor decided not to replace Riccardo, the oboe player. It'll almost be like he's playing with us. That's nice. Will you come, Dad? Yes, let me know what time and I'll work it out. You and I are a lot alike. We're the same. If I die my hair green, we'd really be the same. No, I mean character wise. I'm not like the Terminator at all. She looks at me like I'm a hopeless case. Did she look at you like that too? Sorry, Terminator would be your mother? Yeah. Come on, mom has a lot of responsibility. She has to watch everything, she has to control everything. But she doesn't notice anything. She'll notice if I give her the wrong mug for her tea, but not if I spent the night crying. Why do you cry all night? Do you not realize what's happening? And it's our fault, actually, yours and the world you left for us. It's our fault. Well, not your fault. Why are you worrying like this? Sweetheart, you're 16. You should be laughing, falling in love... There is a guy I like. Well, not straight away... Straight away. - No. - Yeah. But I don't think he likes me. That's impossible. Who is he? I'll show you. He's an asylum seeker who works at the stands where we play. - This guy? - He's cute, right? But I'm pretty much stalking him, I dunno... Anyway, it's a complicated situation. He's too old for me anyway, so I don't think that... Dad? Are you ok? Dad, do you feel ok? No, I just dozed off for a second. - There we go. - You're burning up. - No... - Do you want to go to bed? Do you want medicine? I have to get the sheet music, the assembly is soon. - I'll bring you. - No, Dad, don't worry. No, sweetheart, if I stay here and fall asleep, I'm afraid I'll never wake up, so... - Is this the Nigerian boy? - Malian. - Have you got your mic? - Dunno. Have you been to makeup? Celeste! Can you take care of this nice boy? What do I have to do? He looks good. He seems a little shiny here, no? What do you think, some black around the edges? If you like, we can do a quick touch up. Just to tone it down. - Yes, ok. - Excuse, could I get a coffee? - A macchiato, thanks. - Welcome! It's a great pleasure to have Doctor Sara Della Rocca with us, from the emergency department in Sant'Anna hospital in Rome. - Thanks for joining us. - Thank you. Doctor, would you like to tell us what happened? What was the diagnostic process that led to the surprising discovery of this new epidemic? We spoke with our colleagues in the emergency department and from other institutions and the same thing was happening, an increase in admissions and patients in a lethargic state with very high fevers. So you've had confirmation that this infection is probably transmitted by insects. Doctor, this is what we're all wondering. What insects? A friend of yours is downstairs. Will I tell him to come up? Tell him I'll go down. I didn't recognize his voice. Who is he? This sucks... How are you, darling? Are you going out with your new friend? Heading somewhere nice? - Tell me. - Mom, please. Why don't you tell him to come up? - Enough. - I'll give him some tonic. Please, wait. - Let's talk. - Let me go. - Let's talk... - You bitch. - Have you gone crazy? - Yes, I'm going crazy, all right? I want to know how you are! I want to know what's happening! I want to know that you're ok! I'm fine, better than you, humiliating yourself as a cashier because he doesn't do shit. - Don't say that! - Let him go! You let her go! - Don't touch her! - Calm down! Let's all calm down. You're just making him anxious. I'll deal with this. Come here. - So... - Let me go. You and I haven't talked much recently. I'm sad about it, but it's not serious, it's actually a good sign, it shows that you're growing, that you're growing independent from us. I'm not a perfect father, to tell you the truth, I'm a mess. Can I give you a hug? Come here. My dear boy. You don't have to listen to anyone. Don't listen to your mom, don't listen to me. Live your own life, understand? You have to live your own life! Don't explain yourself to anyone, because we're all screwed up. I'm screwed up too. I'm desperate, I'm dried up like this city! There's so much hatred and you don't even realize it. Dad has a lot of faith in you, go and do your own thing. Whatever you're doing, I'm certain it's amazing. Seba! I love you! What a moron! Let's go. This way. We're a bit over time, so I don't think... Ready? Focus. Closing words, three, two, one. Well, Milena, it's time to pass the baton. Yes, it's goodbye for now, we'll be back soon with Professor Del Vecchio. We have just enough time to greet our guest, who we're delighted to have with us today. It's a shame we can't listen to what he has to say about humanity and wisdom, but he's a welcome presence, a boy with an incredible story. - How old are you? - 22. - Wonderful. Till later! - Till later. You can't scream into my ear! - If I'm speaking to the guest... - I'm lactose intolerant. - I'll check right away. - Thanks. Sorry, this? You look great, Professor. - Are you sure? It's not too much? - No, it's perfect. Commercial break. Excuse me, I was brought here in a car, he said he'd wait for me. - Dunno. - Ok. Come on, our friend will come with us now. They even put you on TV! Well done, brother! I'm sure it was great. I'd say you told your usual stories, the traditions, the rain dance... - How much did you get? - Leave me be! No, because that money was for me! I'm sick of having everything taken from me, understand? Come with me, walk. Is Martina gone out? I have to shower and go to the concert. Martina's father is asleep on the couch. - What? - Martina brought him here. Then he went to sleep. Martina tried to call you, but she couldn't get through. Loris? We saw you on TV. He said: "Give me a minute, be patient." But then... EMERGENCY ROOM - Intensive care! - There are no more beds. I don't give a shit, they'll find one. Someone's asking for you at reception. Can someone else go? I'll go with Sara. Not a patient, he has to tell you something personal. At reception? - Code red. - Another? It's serious. They're analyzing cockroaches at Spallanzani hospital. Civil Defense has sent out extermination teams. - Cockroaches? - They're everywhere. Scozza, Maria Giulia? Or Accatino, Maria Giulia? Is it you? What do you want? Nothing, I... Get out. No, I have to tell you that... That you didn't mean to. That you've felt so bad and for all these years, you've always thought about Mom. And that you thought of me, the little girl who was raised by her grandparents. And that you loved us. That we were so happy, but you don't know what got into you. You lost your job, you were drinking... And you killed her because they told you that she was cheating on you. It wasn't true. And that you thought of writing to me for all these years. Not even a single letter! How many letters did you throw out? Loads, loads. It's like I've heard this a thousand times. There's one thing you don't know. You were in the other room, in your bed. You were asleep. I sat down beside you and I called the police. Then you woke up... You laughed, you moved around, while I cried. That's what I wanted to tell you. You didn't see anything. You were laughing. You didn't stop laughing. I'm thirsty. I'm thirsty! What about that water? This is water from Sondrio, water from the Valtellina valley. It's good. Take it. You take it. Public water! No, come in the back with me. Desalinated water, we won't drink it! Father can't know anything about what we discussed with the councilors. Do you understand? No, what am I not supposed to say? That we'll supply all Valle Aurelia with desalinated water. Don't say a word about that. Ok. Maricèl, it's me. Adriano? He hasn't come back. Ok. No, forget dinner, I'm staying at Fontedoro. NEW MESSAGE Hi, darling! Is this a bad time? Sorry. I hoped I'd find you at home. I have so much to tell you. You've no idea the day I've had. I was great. All the important people were there, the powers that be. I spoke so clearly, I said... Oh God, sorry! I didn't mean to bother you, sorry! No, no, keep working. No, sorry if I annoyed you. - Ok. - Yeah. - Bye, darling. Bye. - Talk soon, bye. Bring us to Ostia, Dante, to the harbor. Miss Raffaella, please, you know Fabio said I can't. Well, Fabio isn't here tonight, we have... this guy. - Valerio. - Valerio, can I? What? - What's she doing? - What a mess, the poor thing. What the fuck are you doing? You cheapskate! I'll leave you on your ass! You're mental! - Babe, calm down! - Lilli, go inside! - "Babe". I'll take everything from you! - What have you done? - You rube! - I'll take this yacht too! - Lilli, get inside! - You parasite! - "Parasite"? - Lilli and the tramp! - What are you gonna take? Psycho! - Go! You need a psych evaluation! - Fuck you! - No, fuck you! You have to get over your pathological narcissism. - You've a long road ahead! - Go fuck yourself! I took a shit! I took a shit on his boat! He told me he'd make me have a psychiatric evaluation! Dante, did you see what I did? I took a... Why are shaking your head? Are you shaking your head, Dante? I'm fucking sick of it, ok? I have to break down this dynamic with men, understand? Don't shake your head. How long do I have to put up with this feeling? When will it go away? Do you think we need a new strategy? What would you advise the Government... in your new role as consultant in the emergency task force? Look... PRESIDENTIAL SUITE, I HOPE YOU LIKE IT. I'LL WAIT FOR YOU - How long is left? - A half hour. - Ma'am, excuse me? - Yes, I'll be right there. ALMOST DONE. THERE SOON! Is that your mom? She works here? Tonight is your initiation! Come on, you'll become one of us! - Stop, Lino. - I'm excited for you! - How are you? - I'm fine. Who do I beat up? A Pakistani who pretends to help oldies with their shopping and robs them. He's Bangladeshi. Bangladeshis are even better... They don't react and they don't report. It's him. He robbed that shopping. I'm sick of this asshole. He has to pay! Go on, Seba! Well, are you ready? - Ask him for the time, and go for it. - I'll kill him. Excuse me! What time is it? What did he do? - Are you all right, bro? - Seba! - What happened? - Answer me! I told you he's a fucking idiot. What a surprise! I was nearby, you said to call. Wonderful! I had forgotten. I have so many questions! You have to tell me everything about the future of the planet and the desertification of the Ager Romanus. - What's this, your book? - Yes, it's a gift. I wrote a little note too. May I? We often think people in cinema are empty, but I always felt there was something special about you, Ma'am. - No need to be so formal. - Sorry. I appreciate that your jacuzzi is empty and turned off. The Teuco? There isn't a party in America now without a toast in a jacuzzi. I'd have left it empty regardless, but it hasn't worked for a while. They says it's the pipes in these old buildings. The pipes? No, I'd say it's a power issue, a circuit breaker. Would you like me to take a look? Don't worry about it, we have so much to talk about! Geez! How many pages did you write? You're amazing! Straight away? Not even a little kiss? How do you feel? I can see ghosts. Doctor, am I dead? Loris, when did you and I stop being happy? Why, were you ever happy? With you, yes, very. You made the right choice leaving me for... - Luca. - That's it. Who knows what I was expecting. He texts an old friend from high school every day. They're planning to move in together. They send each other nudity pics. Nice. What, do you spy on him? No, not at all. It was an accident. He writes to his high school self. That's sweet. I feel sorry for myself. I don't care about anything anymore. I'm nothing. Come here. Take a break, Terminator. Terminator... She calls you that because she admires you. Would you have gone to the concert? Baroque music. Fuck no. My baby... Yeah, but what a drag! - Come on! - No. See how close she's sticking to you? Try and stay alive! You can start again with her, with Martina! - Stay strong, my boy! - Go away. The transfusion! - It's urgent, right? - Yeah. Go ahead, I'll take over here. - Who's that? - I'm Daniela. Sorry. Della Rocca, you're even hotter in real life. That's what you tell TV stars, right? Drop dead, Sanna. They delivered another batch of your sleepers, and there's a 16 year old boy. That's so nice! Where is your husband taking you? Luciana told me he's the actor from the series Roma Criminale. So hot! It was just a small role. Good for you, my husband doesn't want to do shit. - Bye. - Bye. Wait! Sorry. Wait! Thank you. It's ok, I'm here. So, we had fun tonight, right? Room 331. It's all a bit more normal with Fabio. Maybe it would be better if I checked the room? - You're kind. - It's the least I can do. What is it, Ma'am? Nothing. My goodness... - It's all fine. - Then you can go. Ma'am, I wanted to show you something. Valerio, what do you want at this hour? I don't have the box, but it's original. It's valued at 5,000, but it's worth it. I could give it to you for 4,500. It's a bargain price, but I have to get rid of it. I think it would suit you. You want to sell it to me? Fine, let's say 4,000. I'm offering you a bargain. Look. Wow, it really suits you. It's perfect. You stole it. No. Stole? What are you saying, Ma'am? Steal? Me? I was trying to do something nice, but... - Forget it, I'll take it back. - This is Armando's watch. Armando? Who's Armando? What's he got to do with it? Give it back, I'm getting nervous. You stole Armando's watch and you were stupid enough to try and sell it to me. I didn't steal anything. Do you know who gave Armando this watch? My father. Get out of here, right now! Ma'am... - Get out! - No, because... - I said get out! - No, no! - Shut up! - Help! - Help! - I'm a good person! I'm not a thief! - Please, come on! - Help! Shut up, please! Help! I said shut up! How dare you? You cucquean... Please shut up! Please shut up. Ma'am. How dare you? Hello? It's me. What happened? Is he ok? Yes, right away. Could you stop the bus? It's an emergency. - Ma'am, this isn't a taxi! - It's urgent, please open the door! Open the fucking door! Open it! - A moment of great emotion. - The coverage... The words of Doctor Della Rocca have aroused interest and concern. We spoke with our colleagues... DARLING, I CAN'T TONIGHT ...and the same thing was happening, an increase in admissions and patients in a lethargic state... - Who are you? - A friend. - What's your name? - His name is Sebastiano. He's a smart guy, top of his class in high school. He could have been a prince, but he wanted to be my friend instead. When did this start? A while ago. What were you doing? We were... chatting with a friend. Then bam, he collapsed. Ok, thanks, you can wait outside. Wait, sorry. - Yeah? - Did you see any cockroaches? - Cockroaches are everywhere, Doctor. - At his house too? I'm not sure about his place. But there are loads around Torre Spaccata. Ok, thank you. Go. Doctor, if he dies, I'll kill myself! Go on, sweetheart. I wanted to tell you the boy told me he got in a fight last night. He has swelling here. Maybe we should do an MRI? Shall we start diagnosing him now? Sorry, you're the doctor. Why aren't you on maternity leave? Giulia, what are you waiting for? Go home, you fool! Go home! Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, mother of God, pray for us sinners now, and at the hour of our death. Amen. TRAIN TO REBIBBIA FIVE MINUTES That would be painful for a friend of the people like yourself! I'm an enemy of the people. Have you seen the umbrella? What umbrella? My umbrella. - It's a beautiful day. - Yes, but I'm not going out. - You wouldn't put a hand on me! - Not a hand, an umbrella! We can resolve this another way. Your specialty! Get off stage, Alfredo! Go, go! Come on. Vincenzo will bring you, hurry. - Why? - Vincenzo will explain, go. Next time you'll think twice about taking liberties with me. What do you think, Mr President, can he make it? Can we make it, Mr President? Could we be contagious? It needed a screwdriver, I did it with my hands. Let's hope it holds. I knew you were a good hydrologist. Hydrologist, not plumber. Anyway, the problem in Rome is always limestone. On the other hand, without it, they never would have built this city with such wonderful travertine. Shall we fill it? What do you think? It would go well over your daily water allowance. This house is in my ex-husband's name. You seem worried. Do you think the situation is serious? I should have one of his swimsuits. Will we go back to the nightmare of distancing? I would recommend caution. When all the ice melts, the water will take back its space. We're the blue planet, not red, green, yellow. Blue! But we don't need to be afraid. No! Glorious and enduring civilizations flourished on water. So you're not as worried for Rome as you say on TV! It's not the change I'm worried about, but the transformation. Water will have the land it's entitled to and we need to be ready, and know exactly what to do. Will it come as far as here? - What floor are we on? - Sixth. But there'll be water! Below us, all around, everywhere. Venice! I love Venice! We'd be in our element, we're made to be immersed. We're made of amniotic fluid and we'll turn back into it. We're only tenants on this land, Vale. - It's nice here. - Yeah, that's for sure. Excuse me! - Excuse me. - It's ok. - What floor? - Fourth. - Bye. - Bye. It's all our fault! - Babe, come here. - I'm soaking. Doesn't matter. Did you see? What an incredible day. You met someone? What did you want to tell me? He's been restless since the rain started. Feel. He's doing the rain dance. He's happy... because he knows we'll always be there for him. Right? You know Stefania had to send Daiana, the nanny, away? Remember her? She said she stole a watch. People have gone crazy. It's raining, don't make me take out the camera!
