[instrumental music] [music continues] [bell tolling] Skip Toddhunter, this is the third time you've been late this week. Aw, gee, Miss Woods, I can't help it. Honest. I have to help grandpa with the chores. We had to let most of the ranch hands go. Grandpa can't afford to pay them. Oh, yes, I know, there's more than one rancher been havin' a hard time makin' ends meet. What, with cattle rustlin', and gun fights and outlaws like Gils Brady and Benson... Alright, Skip, I'll excuse ya this time. Go on in. Take a seat. [gunshots] [clamoring] - Gils Brady. - Brady's on the loose! [clamoring] [gunshots] [intense music] This goes for you, too, Cochran. [gunshots] [clock cuckooing] [music continues] [clamoring] Just a minute, m-- men... Quiet down! So we can get to the bottom of this. Now, please. Uh, Hal, do you think that this Gils Brady will come back? I'll be here if he does, and so will you. Oh, well, you can depend on me, Hal. [chuckles] Yes, indeed, you can depend on me. I'll see that justice is meted out to this Gils Brady. Yes, sir, the fair town of Triple Creek knows how to deal with such criminals. What about a sheriff? When are we gonna get-- Just a minute, boys! I'm looking into that right now, my friend. We must have patience. But if I should ever meet this Gils Brady face to face... Well, you could depend on me, gentlemen. [clamoring] [intense music] [gunshots] [music continues] [gunshots] That Brady is sure slippery. We're wastin' our time trying to stop him. Why don't Benson do his own gun-battle with that hombre? [gunshots] [dramatic music] [indistinct chatter] Well, I'll never teach school in Triple Creek again. No, indeed. I've endured Indian raids, hunger and privation. Put to have my life in danger day after day by a place I hoped to call civilization. Oh, no! Indeed, not. Skip, take that key over to Mr. Cochran, please. Yes, ma'am. - Well, goodbye, children. - Goodbye, Miss Woods. Run along home now. Now, run along. Now, go straight home. Don't stop anywhere on the way. [dramatic music] [groans] Hello, Miss Woods. Startin' on a little trip? A permanent trip, Mr. Turner. Why, why, Miss Woods, I don't understand-- No, I didn't think you would. Uh, yes, but, my dear young lady... Uh, well, it is my dear lady. Uh, you can't leave the children this way. No. They need you. Why, don't you realize that education is the backbone of c-- I've heard all that before, and I've told you more than once that I'd leave this town if law and order weren't established. Why, I've had my bag packed and ready at the school house for days. Ah, let her go. She's ugly, anyhow. [gunshot] [man yelling] [instrumental music] Now, listen, sister. If you ever stub your toe and fall, I'm out of business, get me? You ought to do right well in Triple Creek with that hair tonic of yours, Spud. I hear the natives have been losing a lot of scalps lately. You said it, Buck, they tell me that's a pretty wild town. No law. That's what you're bringin' into town, ain't it, Gabby? - Law? - That's right. Gabriel Hornsby... Counselor at Law. Sure gonna look good to see that shingle hung out in front of a place. [chuckles] Well, all I can say, boys, is I wish ya luck. [Spud laughs] Well, let's see if you're alright, Emiline. Gimme that mule. Just till I get on my horse.

Well, I wanted to ask if you couldn't give me a little more time on that mortgage. Things haven't been going so good at the ranch. This means a lot to me and the boy. For the last time, no. If you can't pay up, get out. See here, Benson. You can't do this to me! Why, if it hadn't been for your men rustling my cattle, I'd had plenty of money... You can't... You can't... [dramatic music] [clamoring] I want that money in 48 hours or else you and the brat can pack up and leave. Why, you... You leave my grandfather alone! Toddhunter: Skippy! Skippy boy! - Skippy... - Let go of me! Look, Brady's goin' up to Benson. Maybe that'll teach ya a lesson. Say, what's going on here? I don't know that it's any of your business. I didn't like the way you handled that kid. Gils Brady... [clamoring] Spud! Come on! [stuttering] I'm right behind ya, Gabby. [intense music] - That's Gils Brady. - Yes. I never saw him use his fists before. Now, maybe he's gonna use his gun. There's something screwy about this town. Either I'm crazy or the people in it are. [clamoring] I beg your pardon, but who's Gils Brady? Shh! That's him. That's him. - He's a killer. - Yes, yes, yes. I know. Calm down, old fellow. Everything will turn out for the best. Yeah, but not with Gils Brady in town. No, sir! I think I know just what's wrong with you. Come on. [clamoring] Where's the sheriff? Well, doesn't anyone know where the sheriff is? There isn't any sheriff. But I want to thank you for taking the boy's part. That's alright, partner. A town without a sheriff and coyotes like that kickin' kids around. That can't be Gils Brady. I'll be alright. Get me my gun. What're you gonna do about Brady? I don't know yet, but he's up to some trick. Oh, say, I beg your pardon, young man. Uh-- uh, you seem to be having, ahem, a little difficulty and I... I just... [clears throat] Ye-- yeah. Buck Halliday. Well... [laughs] I'm mighty glad to see you, Mr. Turner. Glad to see you, too. I was just headed for your office when all this trouble started. Come on, we'll get down to business. - Good. - Buck Halliday? You two stay out here and keep an eye on things. Watch Tuner, too. My good friend, this is the greatest hair tonic of the universe. Guaranteed to grow hair overnight and selling for the small sum of one wagon wheel, one s-- silver dollar. But I don't need hair, I can always-- That's what's wrong with ya. You're minus something. You're brooding over the loss of your hair and you don't know it. You follow the instructions on this bottle closely and you'll be a well man. Take two tea sp... I mean, uh... Rub two teaspoons full on your hair three times daily, and see what happens. You'll be amazed. Thank you very kindly. Okay, Brownie. So, Benson's pickin' on the Toddhunter boy, huh? - Ha-ha. - Kid's got a lot of spunk. No doubt trying to protect his grandfather. You know, Benson holds a mortgage on the ranch. Well, that's none of our business. Buck, I want to put in a right-of-way between here and Big Ben City. Old road's too dangerous. I know you can figure out a cut-off that'll save this company from four to five hours running time. A new mail contract coming up, eh, Turner? - You guessed it. - [chuckles] Well, let's see. Ho! Ho! Just wait in the depot, miss. I'll get your baggage down. Oh, thank you. As near as I can figure it, the most logical shortcut would be through the Toddhunter Ranch. You see, Mr. Turner, by doing so, you cut out Eagle Pass, which is very dangerous during the winter months on account of the snows. And the washouts during the spring rains. That is why you're running time has been slow. Then our first step will be to see what kind of a deal we can make with Toddhunter before you start your survey. Tibby: Ahem. - That's right. Oh, I beg your pardon, miss. Something I can do for you? - Buck. - Tibby! What on Earth are you doing here? Oh, Mr. Turner, I want you to meet a dear friend of mine, Tibby Mason. - Glad to know you, Miss Mason. - Thank you. It's nice seeing you again, Buck. Often wondered where you were and what you were doing. Oh, the same old routine, surveying and putting in new stage lines. Are you in town for long? I hope so. I'm the new school teacher-- Man 1: I beg your pardon, miss. Your baggage's unloaded. Oh. Oh, thanks. Uh, could you tell me where I could find Mr. Cochran? Across the street and, down a couple of doors. Name's on the sign. "Justice of the peace." Buck, I could stay here and talk to you the rest of the day, but I've gotta report for duty. Uh, as soon as I get settled, we'll be seeing each other. Delighted to have met you, Mr. Turner. - Same here, Miss Mason. - Bye, Buck. [door closes] Nice girl. [laughs] You bet. Now wait a minute till I get this loose. You got it? Hey, Gabby, I forgot to ask you. Did you ever handle a baby? - Sure. Why? - Well, the... Just make believe that, uh, this is a baby, and y-- you don't wanna wake him up. You know, kinda, g-- gentle like? You know? [chuckles] Alright, thanks. That's it, now. T-- t-- take it easy. [chuckles] Take it easy. - How am I doin'? - You're doin' swell. [shattering] I'm out of business. Gabby: Gee, I'm sorry, Spud. Didn't seem to hurt to taste any. Hank: Packing your own liquor, huh? Liquor? That ain't liquor. That's hair tonic. The greatest hair tonic of the universe. Guaranteed to grow hair overnight. And right now, I got a sale on. Never mind the sale. There's only one place in this town to buy liquor and that's Benson's saloon. Benson's? What say, we go over and have a drink? Now, you get this straight. Pack up the rest of that stuff and get out of town. Yes, sir. What do you mean, get outta town? [intense music] [music continues] [clatters] [glass shatters] [laughs] Whoo!

[laughter] Children, children, back inside, back inside. Well, Tibby, how are you getting along? Fine. My first day started off with a fight. But I think I can organize things. Say, evidently, you must look like somebody by the name of Gils Brady. You don't happen to know him, do you, Buck? Well, yes, I-- I know him. What's on your mind, Spud? You know, I think I've got a lawsuit on my hands, Gabby. - Is that right? - Yes. And nobody's gonna tell me what to do! Hank: Reach for it, gents. - Yes, sir. We just came to give ya a little warning. This town don't need a lawyer. Hank: We've got all the law we can use. Benson wants you to go out of business. And if you don't, there'll be a lot of black crepe hanging from that diploma. Buck: There'd be a lot of black crepe hanging on you if you don't drop those guns. Now, drop 'em! [guns clatter] How would you hombreslike to mind your own business for once? Now, get out of here! You know, I've been figurin'. I need more than a lawyer. What I need's a gun. Then I'd show them hombres a thing or two. There they are. They're both yours. Yeah. Well, why not? Two-gun Jenkins! That's me! [gunshot] [all laughing] Them fellas really meant business. Well, Gabby, I got a little business for ya. The Pioneer Line will have to lease the right of way through Dan Toddhunter's ranch, for that new stagecoach route. I'm going out to see him now, and I want you to draw up legal papers for the deal. Well, thank you, Buck. I appreciate it. I'd like to get your signature on this form before you leave. There it is. It's a regular form. [knock on door] [whispering] What do you want? Psst. Psst! That's Gils Brady inside. If you value your life, you'll stay out of there. He's a killer. - Give me a dollar. - A dollar? Yes, sir. Double the dose. Say, Hal, how did you hear about Toddhunter's ranch? Sure. We don't come across with a $1500 in that mortgage, uh... No, no, no. You see. The Pioneer Stage Company have offered to pay a big price if they could run their dues route through Todd's ranch. That's fine, that old turtle'll never be able to raise the money on that mortgage, and that's where I take over. Yes, I know. B-- but you don't understand who's behind it. - Gils Brady. - You're crazy. Oh, no, I'm not. No, no. It's the truth, Hal. But it don't add up. Brady representin' the Pioneer Line? Wait a minute. That's where Turner comes in. Yeah, but Brady could never be representin' that. Well, yes, I know. But you don't understand. Uh, you see, m-- maybe Brady has decided to turn over a n-- new leaf. Uh-- uh, maybe he's decided to go straight. [laughs] What's the matter, Hal? What are you laughin' at? Brady goin' straight. Why, that's it! Got himself another moniker, Buck Halliday, so's he could forget the past. Maybe he goes to Sunday school, too. Oh, well, I know, I, I'd like to believe that, Hal, because I-- I haven't slept at all well, lately and I-- But the pay-off is this. Brady is expecting to put over a business deal with me. Wait till he finds out. Who knows? Maybe we'll become the best of pals. Hal, that-- that lawyer says-- Well, speak up. Where's your guns? It's Gils Brady. I know it's him. He's up to somethin', Benson. He and them two there came into town with him. Why, you blunder heads. Get outta here, both of you. Maybe he's goin' straight and maybe he ain't. But he's gonna keep outta my business. [indistinct chatter] [mellow music] Mr. Halliday, that offer from the Pioneer Line would be a lifesaver. But by this time tomorrow, I won't own this ranch. - How's that? - It'll go to Benson. I just can't meet the mortgage. Well, I'm mighty sorry to hear that, Mr. Toddhunter. It would take you quite some time to get money from Wichita. Yes, I realize that. Have you tried the bank? Well, I already have a loan outstanding there. Suppose the Pioneer Line would back up a loan with this offer? Oh, that'd be too good to be true. Well, as their representative, I'm willing to take the responsibility. Now, you go into town and see my lawyer friend, Hornsby. You tell him I said for him to go to the bank with you, with all the credentials. Oh, that'll be just fine. God bless ya, son. Well, that's no more than right. Oh, by the way, is there a shortcut from here to Boulder Pass? Why, yes, follow this road for about four, five mile and off to your right, down in the river bottom you'll see a cabin. Cut right through there. Oh, I think I remember now. Well, see ya later. [instrumental music] [dramatic music] [horse snorts] [music continues] Gils! Buck! [exhales] It's mighty good seeing you again, Buck. It's good to see you, too, Gils. It's been a long time. Too long. Say, this is a pretty bad wound. I'm gonna get you to the doctor. Mm, it's no use. One of Benson's men got me. But he doesn't know it. We used to be funny kids. Remember? We fooled a lot of folks. I, I was always gettin' into trouble. I don't think you like very much being twins. I liked it alright, Gils. It's just that we didn't see things the same way, that's all. Now, you're going to be alright. Buck, maybe... maybe someday you'll get Benson... legal like. We'll, we'll do it your way. Y-- you will see to that, won't you, Buck? We'll... We'll... [dramatic music] Gils. [indistinct chatter] [instrumental music] Give me a drink of whiskey. [thudding] I said, a drink of whiskey. [babbling] Well, if it ain't the hair specialist. Hello, Mr. Hank. What do you got in there? Oh, two-gun man, huh? Tough guy. Now, wait... Now, wait a minute, Mr. Hank. - You can't do this to me. - Why? Well, I... I'll see my lawyer, that's why. [gunshot] Hey! Oh! [gunshots] [laughter] Old Todd just made a loan at the bank. We'd better tell Benson. - Many thanks, son. - Oh, don't thank me. That's all Buck's doin'. I am thinkin' Mr. Halliday is going to be a very valuable man to Triple Creek. Yes, siree, a very valuable man. Well, don't forget, Mr. Toddhunter. If I can be of any service to ya, don't fail to call on me. - Thank you, sir. - Good day. Good day. So, old Todd made a $1500 loan, eh? If he asks for me, tell him I'm out of town. - You know what to do. - Yeah, we know what to do. Get goin'. [instrumental music] Alright, Hank, let's stop him. Hold it a minute, Todd. - Hiya! - Stop, stop! [intense music] [gunshot] [gunshot] [gunshots] [music continues] Whoa! Ho. Whoa! [groaning] Let me 'lone. Youse done enough. You'll see. [music continues] Look out! It's Gils Brady! [gunshots] Come on! - Are you hurt badly? - I don't know. - Can you make it into town? - I'll try. I want you to get to a doctor as quickly as you can. I'm gonna round up those two. [music continues] [indistinct chatter] It's old Dan Toddhunter. He's been hurt. [indistinct chatter] Granddad, granddad! It's Skip. Speak to me! Come on, boys. Help me get him over to the office. I'm afraid he's gone. [indistinct chatter] Woman 1: Terrible. I hope he isn't in bad shape. [indistinct chatter] What are you doin' here? Hank just got plugged in the hand. I got him hid out in the barn. - Who shot him? - Gils Brady. Beat it. [indistinct chatter] I'm sorry, folks, but Dan Toddhunter has passed on. All: Oh. Benson: Just a minute, Halliday. Seems like you've been riding pretty hard. Well, what are you gonna do about it? You're the man who killed old Todd. - Why, you lying-- - Better save that, Brady. Alright, men. Examine his gun. Why, four shells have been fired, Benson. Well, what are ya gonna do about it? A man's been murdered, and the man who murdered him is standin' right here before you, Gils Brady. That's a lie. The man who killed Toddhunter is wearing a bullet in his hand. - One of my bullets. - Crawlin', eh, Brady? Well, what are you waiting for? - Benson's right. - Let's hang him. [clamoring] Wait a minute, gentlemen. You're condemning an innocent man. Say, Turner, we're not forgetting that you and Brady were pretty close pals. Friends, as your justice of the peace I have never failed in my duties to uphold the letter of the law here in Triple Creek. [indistinct chatter] And those of us who knew old Todd knew him as a man with rare character and nobility. A man highly esteemed in his community be loved by all of us. I say that justice must prevail. Now, far be it for me to say go out and hang a man without a fair trial. But here, my friends, stands Gils Brady. A killer. Brady who has never given any man half a chance. - That's right. - That's right. I don't say that you should go out, rush out, and hang this man, but I do say that here stands a man that hanging is too good for. [clamoring] Look, look! They're gonna hang Gils Brady. That's the first time you been right, yet. Just one more dose of that hair tonic, you'll be a well man. It's here. Spud, we gotta do something. They're gonna hang him. Yeah, I know, honey. I know. Whatever we do, it's gotta be quick. I'm thinkin'. Uh... [whispering] [clamoring] [intense music] Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute! Wait a minute, wait a minute! I'm Buck Halliday's lawyer and I demand a trial. Better stay out of here, tinhorn. Yeah, you take it easy, son. There's liable to be a double hangin'. Come on, get him there. Hurry it up. Come on, men, what are we waitin'... [clamoring] [fire crackling] [intense music] I sure hope this works. You don't think he'll burn the schoolhouse down. - Do you, Spud? - Huh? What do you care? You're gonna get married anyhow... someday. [chuckles] Have you any last words to say, Brady? - No. - Well, then... May heaven have mercy on your soul. Help! Help! School house is burning down! Well, the school house is burning down. Schoolhouse is burning. [clamoring] The schoolhouse is on fire! [clamoring] [bell ringing] Now's your chance, Buck. Get out of town. I'll meet ya at the cabin at the foot of Boulder Pass. - Here's your iron, Buck. - Thanks. [clamoring] - What about the fire, Spud? - Yeah, what about it? [laughs] [fire crackling] [intense music] [clamoring] [bell ringing] And that's the story. Gils Brady was Gilbert Halliday. My twin brother. Twin brother? No wonder folks took you for him. The last thing Gil said before he died was... "Maybe we'll get Benson someday, Bucko. Legal like." And that's the way it's going to be, Tibby. Legal like. How're you gonna do anything legal like in Triple Creek? Hornsby here is going into politics. Triple Creek is going to have a new justice of the peace. Nothin' to worry about, now that we got the bullet out. Thanks, Jitters. [door slams] Hank, get ready to leave. - Where am I goin'? - Old Tod's ranch. It's mine now, and it'll be a good place for you to stay till that hand heals up. - What about the kid? - Throw him out. Or maybe you're too sick for that. [instrumental music] Hornsby, you get into town and get you politics started. Tibby, tell the school children to talk their parents to vote for Hornsby. Tell 'em that he's for law and order. - I'll do my best. - But listen, Buck. Supposin' Benson and his men tries to bust up the works. I'm on a little bustin' diet myself. [horse trotting] Hank. That's the man I'm after. If you are elected, that's our first victim. Come on, Spud. [music continues] Skip! [intense music] - Skippy! - Well, what do you want? Pack up your things, kid. You're gettin' off this ranch. This is my granddad's ranch. You can't throw me off. Want me to help you make up your mind? Ouch! Let go off me. Ouch, let me go, let me go! Let go! You miss your friend, Gils Brady, don't ya? I wouldn't handle the kid like that. You might hurt your hand. [music continues] Well, what do you want with me, Brady? I'll tell you what I want. - Get his guns, Spud. - Who? Me? Oh. Huh? Hold still, Mr. Hank. Now, get over there and sit down.

[indistinct chatter] Get Cochran here, he'll speaks make that tinhorn blue in the face. Say now, see here, Brady, I want to tell you for the last time that this is illegal. Yes, it is. It's illegal. It amounts to forcible entry and intimidation. Hurry up, Cochran. I haven't got much time. - Well-- - Never mind the law books. You wouldn't know how to use 'em. You get on that horse and don't you stop to talk to anybody until you get to Death Valley. Death Valley? Why, that's illegal. You'll be right at home. Now, get out of here.

[gunshots] [music continues] [gunshots] [indistinct chatter] [gavel banging] Triple Creek County Court is now in session. Ahem. Justice Gabriel Hornsby presiding. I promised you folks of Triple Creek that as justice of the peace I'd have the murderer of Dan Toddhunter here in this courtroom this morning. Man 2: That's it. That's it... Friends, I have kept my promise. [indistinct chatter] I'm going to ask Mr. Benson if he will take the stand and tell what he knows about the murder of Toddhunter. Get Cochran here right away. [indistinct chatter] Raise your right hand. You promise to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothin' but the truth, so help you? I do. I don't know nothin' about Toddhunter's murder. What kind of tinhorn justice is this anyway? [indistinct chatter] [gavel banging] Yes, sir. I think the time's gonna come when hangin' a man ain't gonna be a public exhibition. What do you think, Hank? Yeah, that's the first time I ever used this on a dead man. That is almost a dead man. [laughs] Yep. Yes, sir. So tell the truth, Hank, you wouldn't like to be hung in a public place, would ya? Of course not. Ah! Now, you take the hang post of today. Stop it! Stop it, I tell ya! [knocking on door] Cochran. Cochran. Open up, will ya? Don't you say a word. [knocking on door] I forgot he can't talk. You're crazy if you think you can pin anything on me. Gils Brady is the man you want. [indistinct chatter] [gavel banging] Order, please. Mr. Benson, you may leave the stand. I believe Mr. Turner has something of interest to say to this court. I have, Your Honor. You raise your right hand, please. You swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you? I do. For Benson's information, also for the people of Triple Creek, I have proof that Gils Brady is dead. Order, please. He died before Dan Toddhunter was murdered and is now buried up in Boulder Pass. Mr. Treadwell, our undertaker, exhumed the body. Six of us who knew Brady identified him. The others will corroborate my testimony. [indistinct chatter] Gabby: Order! Order, please, in court. Brady's true name was Gilbert Halliday. The man you were going to hang is Buck Halliday. Brady's twin brother. [indistinct chatter] Cochran must've skipped town. I think we better do the same thing. Order, please. Thank you, Mr. Turner, that'll be all. [indistinct chatter] Man 3: Well, look who's here. [clamoring] Gabby: Order in the court! Order, please! Order, please! [gavel bangs] Order! - Hank, raise your right hand. - I'll raise it for him. Gabby: Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you? - I do. - He does. Gabby: Take the stand. - Stay where you are, everyone. Benson: We'll shoot the first one that moves. [intense music] [clamoring] [music continues] Hey, Shorty. When all this is over with I wanna have a talk with you.
