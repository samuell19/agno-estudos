That has been my responsibility Don't walk on it It's not finished You can't believe the impact these dumpsters have had Only thing is, people tend to make a mess around them It's like people just can't be bothered to open them So that's been my responsibility also Eeww Oh man, what is with people I don't know, maybe some finds dumpsters romantic I see.

Is he Polish? No, he's Swedish, fine accordionist, a bit strange Mom and dad met him at a folk festival never got rid of him after that I've been thinking, about the old days, when we were all up at the cabin together aha I believe some things are meant to be and that some things were meant to be like, sometimes when I'm at home, playing the accordion and I get so caught up in it Then I come to, and realize that I'm not there, but here and I'm alive, you are alive but in a very different place different from then, you see Well hello, Havel What have I done What on earth have I done Havel, it's just a painting Your dad, it sounds like he was a hoot Yeah A lot of people thought so I got a medal for swimming and Harald got one for Lego Wow, I'd kill for a medal, never had one Yes, well, we won the University's engineer challenge really Made this Lego contraption, it's not important Embla is a great swimmer Jeez, I just get shy in such illustrious company Kolbeinn, are you going to eat, or what?

You're not the only member of SAHOO I don't understand why it had to be like that last night suddenly this was some party some bender Is alcohol an issue no has it got something to do with the gambling?

If nothing happened in the tent then nothing happened done deal And if something happened, then that doesn't matter either you know... my dad, who was horrible basically an asshole, but he taught me one thing sex is just sex, it doesn't matter, you don't have to take it seriously can't we just meet up in town and give this a chance? you know what, Harald, I've made nothing but mistakes for years I have to start doing something right hi But, why not make one more mistake and... ...let me be that mistake? are you going to invite me in? by all means. wine?
