What are Garbage Pail Kids? Garbage Pail Kids are pictures of people who are a little bit worse off than you are... but only slightly. Garbage Pail Kids were part of the kids counterculture of the 1980s in a fine tradition of anti-authoritarian stickers and jokes would be sold with bubble gum for, I think it was a quarter. They're a take-off on Cabbage Patch Kids dolls as gross little characters on bubble gum stickers Remember, in 1985 we're still in the Cold War and here was a card of a Cabbage Patch Kid going nuclear. And I was like wow you know this, this means something. I knew that even then. There's always a smile they have on their face like something terrible is happening but I'm still good. They're just jokes... Never has there been a more exciting time to be alive, a time of rousing wonder and heroic achievement, as they said in the film Back to the Future, Where we're going, we don't need roads. If you don't like the subject of this next piece, just think this too shall pass. Here's Jeff Greenfield. Just come to any neighborhood school and watch as the latest fad instantly sweeps across a classroom and then across a continent. Watch that is if you dare because the odds are that what appeals to the young is going to appall the old. Latest case in point. Are you ready for Garbage Pail Kids? ♪ Throw away like trash ♪ We party all the time ♪ I can see you ♪ The party in the corner having apple juice ♪ ♪ Freddy Roberts on the guitar ♪ We are the garbage pail kids! ♪ ♪ We are the garbage pail kids! ♪ Here we go... You got it? Your sure? I gotta get these out of my hands. We just made it to Art's house, Art's studio. Do you wanna hear that? Yeah, I don't know, would it be funny to talk about it? Hi, I'm Art Spiegelman. I'm a comics artist. Um, and for many decades I worked for Topps Bubblegum Company making novelty items to be sold with bubblegum and one of the more renowned of the projects I worked on with Topps was Garbage Pail Kids. And they were parodies of Cabbage Patch Kids although attorneys would not like to hear me say that. But they were parodies of a then popular doll uh, that uh, allowed kids to destroy parents' refrigerators and taunt each other and excoriate themselves for whatever they'd been named, by having their little first names underneath grotesque images of these cute, little uh, doll kids. And they became a fad and Topps was essentially something that was in the fad business. At the top of the heap were the comic strip artists below those were the comic book artist and somewhere way down right before you hit tattoo artist was the people who worked at Topps Bubblegum. Topps was like, to me the end of the road in Brooklyn, like the real southern end. And that was probably about a 45-50 minute bus ride from where I lived. Topps was in Brooklyn then, in a very, kind of, romantic area - kind of - good background for a Mafia movie, where they put people in cement and stuff and throw them into the river. It was a warehouse street and it was really cool. And when you would go into inside the buildings it was like a bunker. There were like no windows and I don't know. It was just really strange. These interminable, Xeroxed buildings that looked one like the other going forever and every direction near the waterfront. Inside one of which on a kind of, cobblestone street there's one building looking like all the others, except it had, uh, detached doll heads in the street that you had to step on while walking and because a place called Uneeda Doll was right on top of the bubble gum company. The Uneeda Doll Company. And yeah, I mean you know on our way to work with our coffee in our hand, we'd be walking down the street and there'd be doll heads like littering the sidewalk. I'm sure worked it's way into our - into - into our work the following afternoon. When I first went out to Topps Bubblegum to meet Len Brown, I didn't know what to expect. And so I took the dingy subway, out to the dingy part of Brooklyn, walked the dingy street to this weird factory building. I knew it was Topps because when I came out of the subway stop I smelled bubblegum. It was unique in that the gum was made two flights above our editorial business offices. When you be approaching our building just like walking down the street. You could be talking, and the sugar dust would actually land on your tongue. And you could actually taste the sweetness in the air and smell it, you know from the manufacturing. You knew you were approaching Topps. It was totally unique. I'm Len Brown. I'm living in Bee Cave, Texas and I worked at Topps for 40 years and the last 25, I was the creative director in the New Product Development Department. We started to come into the candy business in a much bigger way. Bazooka uhh, was our big bubblegum, I don't think I mentioned the name of it. But Bazooka was probably the number one bubblegum in the country back then. It was such an icon up America in the '50s and '60s. They made as a staple bubblegum, not even the best bubblegum eventually but they made bubblegum and that allowed them a franchise to move into these baseball cards. And it was this man who would become incredibly important to the history of popular culture and certainly to me, named Woody Gelman. Woody's job was to come up with trading card ideas. Woody Gelman was of course the creative nucleus of Topps. He had been a cartoonist. He was a story and idea man first for Disney and then for the Fleischer Brothers. Going back to the earliest days, he helped create baseball cards and hired all these amazing artists to work on the Topps product that people from EC, Norm Saunders later Robert Crumb, Len Brown. The list goes on and on. But then we started talking about different products that we could be putting out. And more and more, there was a need for what they called non-sports cards. They felt that was a market that we weren't really tapping into as best we could. One of the first things that we worked on collectively was a civil war series back I guess around '61. We were instructed by the president that a company with a civil war Centennial coming up let's put out civil war cards and Woody and I both at first thought it was a terrible idea. That it's educational. Kids get that in school. Why would they want civil war cards for? And Woody had the notion well, we'll make them want it. We'll make them violent and bloody battles of the civil war. We'll show blood and guts. And 'lo and behold it became a big hit. And that was a forerunner of Mars Attacks. And that was a forerunner of Mars Attacks. Wacky Packs which was one of the very important pop culture moments that Topps engaged in, grew out of hanging out with Woody. Oh, Woody was the world's greatest collector, I mean, going to his house was a real treat. It was like going to a great museum of pop culture. Stuff that nobody could ever get to see like all the Little Nemo Sunday pages. A lot of the originals. Multiple runs of Life Magazine when it was a humor magazine. All the old Argosy, the old Amazing Stories pulps, old runs of Saturday Evening Post from the '20s and '30s. And what Woody did was collected one run that just stayed as bound volumes. Two runs that he could cut apart. And then say OK- here's the Art Young file. Here's the Harrison Cady file. Here's the John Held file. He'd like be organizing the stuff in a time when nobody had any interest in this stuff, I can't tell you how far outside the radar this was. It wasn't a world of e-bay. It was a world where finding it involved meeting like-somebody just happened to have a pile in their basement you know. And one day he brings in a bunch of these things to Topps on a day that I'm there and shows me and he says I love these things. These are advertising cards from like the 1890's and early 1900's. They'd be things that would look like a tin can or an ear of corn was one I remember... an airplane... whatever. And there'd be an advertisement for something printed on the back, on the front was this really beautiful rotary printing on light cardboard. He said you know we should be doing these, says Woody. I think what he envisioned was a pouch that a pre die cut ears of corn and apples with a bite taken out and whatever and something on the back. They're beautiful. But you're saying what? Like we would do a box of cornflakes? Or a pea pod with some peas in it? Well, yeah that would be good. Well, wouldn't it be better to do it like the way Mad does it and do parodies of these things, rather than the actual thing? I remember the back cover of one issue of Mad had a spoof, a spoof of the cigarette Salem. But I cut out the size of that package and showed it to Woody and he liked it right away. And either he or Art suggested that and it should be little more illustrative. Like a little funny guy doing something. So there's a visual besides just the word gag. And I felt that that was the beginning of Wacky Packages. Uh, Harvey Kurtzman, the guy who created Mad, also had done these kind of humanistic, if not anti-war, at least understanding about the real horrors of war. War comics at a time where the equivalent of Sergeant Rock would be like pulling a grenade pin out of his mouth and tossing it into a pile of nips and saying Here's one from my Aunt Tillie! Meanwhile the Harvey Kurtzman war comics were cognizant of the fact these were kids that were drafted into wars and were being blasted apart not knowing what they had gotten into and their lives were being cut short as a real tragedy in war. This was the height of the Korean War that they became very popular but I thought that those war comics which were never as popular as Mad became which he'd created, were the ones that taught you to question authority. And I really do believe that they had a lot to do with that 60's moment where a lot of members of my generation said "Hell no, we won't go". Or "Hey, hey, LBJ, how many kids did you kill today"? And stuff like that-all was born from that Mad counterculture influence. Because Harvey Kurtzman who created this thing had created a new paradigm. It was a kind of self-reflexive, ironic humor that cut through the bland American 1950's. It was basically saying The whole adult world is lying to you. And we here at Mad are part of the adult world. Good luck kid. Figure it out. It was like a zen koan to work with. My name is Mark Newgarden. I'm a cartoonist. I am from Brooklyn, I was born in Brooklyn, I live in Brooklyn and I'm one of the creators of Garbage Pail Kids. One of the early trading cards things I did was they were revising Wacky Packages and this would have been around '83 or '84, I think. And I started working on those pretty early on. I remember, Len and I drove out to Toys R' Us in Bay Ridge, one day - went up and down the aisles looking fat toy things to parody. And um, at that time, Cabbage Patch Kids were a big hot commodity and it just seemed like a very obvious thing to include so, I did one that I entitled The Garbage Pail Kids and that was sort of the original coining of that term. And the problem of the day around this conference table was what are we going to do about Cabbage Patch Kids? What is going on here? People are fighting over something that's become hotter than Santa Claus. The Cabbage Patch Kids. Cabbage Patch came out. Cabbage Patch Kids and became enormous. And we thought maybe we could get the rights to do Cabbage Patch Dolls on cards. You know pictures of them with the names and all that. And we thought would be a nice collectible. And so they were asking an incredible, formidable amount of money for Topps which was anything above $5 I would think, for the license. And the, the result was that wasn't going to work because they were asking for too much money and it was too far along in its own cycle of popular culture of fad to be guaranteed hit. If you could already get the T-shirt, it wasn't quite as big a deal to get the little sticker. We were disappointed and I think Arthur Shorin then said - Well, hell with them. Let's do it. We'll make fun of them. You know, we'll parody them like we did with Wacky Packages. Arthur Shorin had a term for certain - he had terminology for different types of products. And one of his favorite types of products to make were fuck-you products. He said - let's do a fuck-you product of Cabbage Patch Kids. Stan Hart had been working, going back to the 1950's at Topps and was married into the Shorin family. Brother in law of the CEO and Stan was a Mad Magazine writer and had done a lot of TV show writing other stuff a Broadway play. So at that point Stan, in a rather imperial way, said Well, we'll just do the parody version. We can do the fuck you version. And then me and Len looked at each other because very often these these cryptic statements from Stan would leave us gulping. And he was like Well Stan, what would that be? Uh, well you know we would just do funny versions. All right. Uh, And. We had no idea how to do more than one. I remember Art or it might have been Len. I think it was Art running back into the meeting room, the NPD room where I was sitting working at something asking for the painting for the Cabbage-Garbage Pail Kids that we had sitting in the pile and he ran back into Arthur and then maybe an hour later coming back to his room - Okay, we've got to do a series of these now. So that was from my vantage point. And that was Arthur Shorin's edict that now we've got to do a series of these. And that team -that group which wound up being Artie Spiegelman and Mark Newgarden, Stan Hart was this big towering voice coming into the office. Hello, hello, hello. This big guy who worked on the Carol Burnett Show and had his Emmys and all that. And there was Len Brown as the creative director kind of, you know pulling all these nuts together and the various artists who are going to be involved on it. And they would get together and have meetings and discuss where they, how they were going to develop this parody. I was not a part of that. I was never a part of the GPK team while they were doing that. I was probably you know writing and editing Howard the Duck cards. God help me at that time. So at that point the problem was how do you make up a series of these things because there wasn't much to build on except this generic doll that indeed did have adoption papers with it. And one of the things that worked well back in the very earliest days when I was at Topps was something called Ugly Stickers. Before Garbage Pail Kids they did a series of Ugly Stickers. And the first ones they did were just ugly Basil Wolverton characters that had the name of supposedly kids on them. So it would be like an ugly creature and it would be called Fred or Art or Bob or something. Except and it didn't work at first because they use the names of the people at the Topps office. So there would be these ugly Stickers with names like Maurice. You know. Nelly or I don't know if Nelly wasn't used back as the name. They weren't like names that norm, that an average kid had. They were like names for people that were in their '50s. So originally Garbage Pail in a real early stage, Art sent to me a rough of a doll, just a goofy lookin' doll, that said the name was Olga. So you know it could have been that But, Art came up with the idea of the name plus an adjective to describe what her vice is or what her grossness is. You know, like Leaky Lindsay is a kid blowing her nose. And that's what worked. That's how come they were able to do thousands of these things over the years. We immediately tried to come up with a concept that would work and now it seems like gee that must have been fun and obvious but it wasn't at first. So the style is all over the place and then I kept doing idea sketches for them every few months to refresh the idea pool. And they kind of started evolving into pages where I divided into comic panels that had no connection to each other. And I just do the same... I love one, I see where you're going with this guy... So this room, three-fourths of it was the studio. So Adam Bomb was born right here - in this spot right here? Yes. And his 400 or 500 brothers and sisters. So then in the fall of '84 one day the phone rings. And it is Art Spiegelman and him saying "Hi this is Art Spiegelman from Topps and", John, you know we know your work. "Would you be interested in doing a few Wacky Packages?" And one of them was Garbage Pail Kids, a little rough that I think it was Mark Newgarden's rough. And, and a little doll in the box and which was making him into a little bum undershirt and a trash can and so on. I was doing from '79 to about '84, I was doing these fantasy paintings as well as comic book covers. And I was starting... There was a period a couple of things happened. There was a gap in my jobs coming in and I was also thinking I really miss humor. Because doing fantasy art for me, I was almost having to pretend. In a different way than doing humor cartooning. And so I just remember saying I wish I could get some kind of humor job. So John sent us in just sheets and sheets of ideas. And out of everybody's work. John was obviously the guy there was just no question right off the bat. It's like OK this is it. John. This is John's job. I'd started working on it. And I instead of getting like six idea sketches I found myself writing. It's like this stuff was coming into my mind almost these ideas and thinking how about Little Monsters? I'd start listing up all the monsters. How about body fluids? I'd do a list of words and then I'd do some pictures. Now and then, How about a walking dead one? Because I'd done recently that year I had done a walking dead cover for Twisted Tales. And I had a little collage in my sketchbook from somewhere where it was a spoof on Ronald Reagan sitting at a desk pushing a button. And I thought Hey, how about a little kid pushing a button? And in the background let's have an atom bomb going off. So I sent them in. There's a little pause for a while and then I get a phone call saying Hey John we got the job. You think you can do all of 44 paintings in two months? And this is like late 1984 and so basically I said Yeah I'll try. You know I was a little unsure because doing fantasy art. Everything was taking two to four weeks to do a completed painting and this was like a real change of gears. But John was the one who had the chops to make this thing look like a Topps product. The problem with it was it had to be as grotesque as the Ugly Stickers, but as sweet as these Cabbage Patch things. And that was a funny spot to hit because if it's really ugly- it's not cute. So it was trying to get John to get cuter and cuter while getting uglier and uglier; it was a complex zone. And finally something that, again probably lawyers would not be thrilled to know uh, if they're working to defend Topps but at some point I said Could you take a look at these damn Cabbage Patch Dolls? They're much cuter than anything you've got. Just, if you have to, just buy one of the dolls and I'm sure Topps will reimburse you. You know, and all of a sudden it came back right. Part of one of the things I would do come in on a Monday and I'd get the FedEx's and I would open up John's FedEx. I remember like taking out that painting that was in the very first batch and thinking Oh man, this is good. This is really good. And just having this gut feeling we we're on to something special with the series. And then it was a matter of coming up with other gags because one does not make a series even two doesn't make a series if you can come up with three you can come come up as we proved with 300. So I just thought I guess I have to do a painting a day and... and that means I had to get methodical about it because I thought if I just don't have myself very organized this is going to get real sloppy everywhere. So I thought, OK let's break down a painting a day. OK - got to do the drawing. Got it. I need to a color rough so I know what the heck I'm doing for the effect. So that's... that's a two hour chunk for pencil and color. And then, then... let's say I was trying to be humane to myself, So I said OK - do, that means the actual painting would take four hours. So, you transfer it, do the flesh in one hour, do the clothes in one hour, do the props in one hour, do the background in one hour. And I thought I got it! There's a painting a day. So by knowing where I was going for my color rough I would have the white of the paper as my white and just worked my way through light to dark. Then I do the same for things like the hair and the clothing and like the character would usually, sometimes have a prop maybe it's safety pins or maybe it's a bomb, maybe it's a doll, a trash can, a gun, a steamroller maybe rolling the character down. I had time limits on myself and in drawing these things so if it was something where I had to make a trip-if I had to make a trip to the library that's across town I had to figure - can I afford the time to get references? Or can I just make do with my clips file or my imagination? Art would usually call John And, um, or he'd be on a conference call and we'd kind of go through these drawings you know, item by item make this kid's nostril bigger. Make this kid's ear lobe longer. Make the fangs sharper. Like one picture in particular is that like Russell Muscle or whatever he is-number 51. I had done a little muscular guy and Art said well that's OK. But I mean that's kind of there, but put muscles on his muscles. And another thing he would say, you know on particular pieces exaggerate more- exaggerate-exaggerate. Which, I mean, that's great advice and really appropriate for what we're doing. You know pump - pump it up more. The doing the fantasy art had - I was trying to go for drama and swagger in the work there. And so when Garbage Pail Kids came along I was still bringing that mindset to it. I thought these are cute little characters. But when I could think of an idea or a pose that would work for the little guys I was, I would try to go for something- I, mean I didn't get it on everyone but you know sometimes you just do a little character Here I am! Tah dah! I mean, literally, like you know, many, many fine tuning comments as we went along. And John was great. I mean you know he really would always improve what we were asking for and then go beyond. On series after series sitting across from Mark Newgarden where we'd glare at each other unhappily until one of 'em would say Well you know, One of us would say what about a kid with his eyeballs dripping out? What about a kid with uh, who's been ripped opened? What about a-you know, so just like trying to find possible hooks for one thing after another. And that was basically a full day of sitting there and arguing over the names endlessly. I think it was a total balance of ideas the way they would bat things back and forth one would say something the other one would-it was like a comedy team actually - Art and Mark. And now we're on the track and at that point it was working with what the backs could be that could personalize it- well, like adoption papers or other kinds of documents that you could personalize - because Topps had a series that wasn't successful way before that of Dopey Diplomas or Loony licenses - things like that. The very first set of backs, as I recall, Um, Len dug into the archives and found some old series that Jack Davis had illustrated that were sort of license plates and permits and they were very deliberately a take off of like a early 1930s exhibit card series- the kind that you would buy on like arcades. You put a nickel into a slot and you'd get like, you know, a back seat driver's license. It was a very, old staple in sort of lowbrow American humor. Um, So Len pulled these things out. And he said Well how about these for the backs? And I said, ok, you want me to like sort of like riff on these? And, he goes No, these. And I literally hand-wrote out for the first series every one of those backs, making very, very minor changes where I could just I want to try to update them and made them funnier and then sketch out whatever illustration might work in terms of the characters. And that was the very first series of backs and I think by the second series Len trusted me to, okay, you know, you can write your own now. Towards the end Jay Lynch was doing a bunch of the backs. He was um, he had been a contributor to Topps projects for years. He was not involved with Garbage Pail Kids at all early on. Basically because he seemed to be working for the competition which was Cabbage Patch on a series of Cabbage Patch stickers for another company. So it was deemed that he was not um, it was not ethical for him to be doing both of these projects at the same time. A series would run 44 images and that was based on the sheet that these cards were printed on, in rows of 11. And 44 was always the minimum you would ever want for a series. And with Garbage Pail Kids they want to do the minimum because they were double printing. They would have two names for every kid. So in theory, a kid would not only be collecting 44 images; they'd be collecting 88 cards altogether. And that took off in a big way also, almost the way a, you know, a decade earlier. Wacky Packages had taken off. In fact those are the only two products that Topps put in the history that I think we ever did something like 13 or 14 different series one after another. I mean we just kept going one. When one series was done, we immediately started coming up with material for the next series because it was just so popular. As a result it immediately became every kid had to know about it; Every parent had to censor it. They were being confiscated in classrooms all over the United States and it became a true fad phenomenon like Topps was always trying to do, but mostly Wacky Visors was not one of the big hits, but Garbage Pail Kids was, you know. It's the hottest medium of exchange right now in classrooms from Manhattan to Malibu. Bubble gum cards featuring the most grotesque caricatures imaginable. Luke warm, Spacy Stacey. Some are gross, some are neat. They're like - beautiful to other kids and sometimes gross to me. They're really disgusting. They're gross, that's what I like. They're cards with drawings of grotesque parodies of Cabbage Patch dolls. Dead Fred, Acne Amy, Baby Barfy. You get the picture. Kids all over the country, buy them, collect them and trade them like baseball cards. I will trade you for. Hairy Kerry, for Messy Tessy. I all ready have Messy Tessy. Ok... ♪ 80'S STYLE HEAVY METAL ♪ We're the Garbage Pail Kids! ♪ We're the Garbage Pail Kids! ♪ The chorus is repeated over and over ♪ When I first discovered Garbage Pail Kids cards I was actually on our school bus heading actually to school and I was sitting in the middle of the school bus and saw these kids with their knees touching in the aisle and I was like why are they looking at? So as we were stopping I was kind of making my way up as we made stops and I notice that they they're actually going through these cards and I'm like what are those? And instantly when you look at them it's almost like a parent not talking down to you as a child. It just was right away like almost adult material to me. And she sent me this. This is Beth. I still remember her name from when I was a kid. I absolutely loved my Cabbage Patch Kids just as much as my Garbage Pail Kids. I saw all of the fans around the Cabbage Patch Kids. And then the Garbage Pail Kids came out obviously making fun of it. And to me as a six seven year old. That was hilarious. I absolutely love it because Cabbage Patch Kids were so sweet and innocent, and little pacifiers and little dogs that come along with them and bunny rabbits and then you go here and they're like ripping the legs off storks, and missing teeth, and witches, and demonic and that was so hilarious. And that was probably around that age where I realized that I didn't just want to be around sweet little girly things. I wasn't a princess. I wanted to watch horror films and collect really gory cards that grossed out my parents. You know my parents can't find out that I have this Garbage Pail Kids because: they strictly forbade having them in the house. I paid for them with their money that they did not give me. So I go to bed one night in middle of the week. And I'm fast asleep dreaming the dreams of a 10 year old of Garbage Pail Kids and Goonies and I am jolted awake. The blinding light is flashed into my eyes. The bedroom lights are on. The drawers of my dressers have all been opened my clothes are strewn everywhere. And my dad is now sitting at the edge of my bed waking me up. Brian. Brian. We have to talk. Where are they? What? Where's what? Where? Where are the drugs? We know. This money's been missing. My parents. Have been convinced that their 10 year old son was a drug addict. Um, Instead I turned over a big stack of Garbage Pail Kids cards. I remember growing up and kids my age were always trading baseball cards and keeping them in their little binders in mint condition and I just hated baseball. I didn't excel at sports. That never spoke to me. And then I remember vividly in second grade someone had- I saw an Adam Bomb card and my name is Adam and all of a sudden like everything felt right to me and like here is a card for people like me. Um. I didn't really fit in. I didn't play sports and it was funny. It was crude; it was crass. At that age I was already had aspirations to be a comedy writer and I was like the universe is right - Garbage Pail Kids. I ended up writing Topps through one of the wrappers the address and it somehow got to whomever At Topps and she - you got the blanket letter back from Topps-back in the day. And then on the back when you flipped it there was three hobby shops that you could contact for if you wanted to purchase and so forth and I wrote all three and Roxanne was the only one that actually responded to my letter. And these were also issued the original time in the late 80s for Garbage Pail Kids. They were folders for kids to, for real kids to take to school. Put some of their work in, in the folders and this doesn't have anything to do with Garbage Pail Kids but it's a great piece. This is Batman sitting on the toilet. And this was done by Norm Saunders as a joke at Topps; it never made it into mass production. But some of us were lucky enough to get hold of one of these cards. During the time of Garbage Pail Kids in the '80s was the busiest time that we ever had. And I just, when I first heard about them it was from Mark Macaluso who was another mail order dealer at the time and he called and told me about them and I said to him, what is wrong with Topps? Have they cracked up altogether that they're going to put something like this out? Having been a teacher, I thought they were pretty gross and I just didn't like some of the things in them. I thought we always try to teach children to respect our Presidents. And here was Rapping Ron and things like that. But then I started selling them because I would sell everything that was out at the time. Well, mainly they wanted complete sets and we would sort them. We would buy cases and boxes and sort them and make sure that all the variations were in them. Now when Series 3 happened I didn't know until much later that they started bringing in other artists like Tom, Tom Bunk and a couple of other artists that show up in the book here. I mean, I didn't know til they were printed. To keep John from burning out. And then there was a talent hunt that extended to and included some of the key artist were really Tomas Bunk who I had met when he first came to New York because he'd been from the German wing of the underground comics planet. And when I met him he had also been inspired by the same Mad comics artist that inspired me as a kid. We got along swell. Well you know I'm not a politician. I don't have anything to lose. You can ask whatever. Hey! Good seeing. Yeah, get a good sound. Here's one. Oh yeah, that's cool. You used for reference? Yeah, that's what I had. I had to hide it. He's from the 80s, then? Yeah he is from the '80s. Isn't that ugly? Oh my gosh. So, Art said to me if I would do the fronts too because I did the backs for the first three series and the fourth also, and he said, if I would do the fronts? And I was kind of like... You know, I'm not really very ambitious. A little bit I am. But I said, Oh I don't know if I can do that and stuff. And uh, Yeah you can, you can try and then I had to do it in the the style of John Pond which was kind of difficult because he used acrylics. And airbrush. And so I have to learn airbrush and do all the stuff so in the beginning it was kind of tricky because acrylic also is very tricky to work with because it dries it gets darker and I couldn't get like. So I panicked often and so on. But then, then it worked fine. And then a guy named James Warhola. As, a, it's kind of great to do. I'm going back to these I loved doing them, but these are Just, I usually use a lot of tissues working on tissues and of course I'd get them to the point where I'd sketch them up and fax them to the art director and they'd give me the go ahead. And then I'd go with the final artwork. My originals were always done in oils back in the 80s, mid-80s, '86 -'87. But then I went into doing these in acrylic. And acrylic were for a short period it was easier because they dried faster. Paint never got on anything. There's one of my color sketches that I'd done for for the one with that was kind of a take off on the World War II poster. My name is James Warhola. I live here in New York New York City and I do art work, I'm a painter and I have a vast history in the illustration field. I guess I've hit all corners of the field and I guess you could say, one of the low points was Garbage Pail Kids. Well... I talked to Art and Mark and I got to meet them and they showed me what the project was and it had to do with doing these gross, disgusting images of Garbage Pail Kid cards they call them. And I thought wow that's kind of interesting. But on my trip back from Topps I thought to myself I would never do these things. I just couldn't face the fact that I was coming from, you know doing some of the best writers in the science fiction field like Heinlein and Asimov and William Gibson and I'd be doing Garbage Pail Kid cards. I thought no way. So, I told them I'd think about it and I left the factory in Brooklyn I took the long subway home and I said "Gee it's just crazy. I don't think I can do it." You know, and then I looked down on my shoe and I had gum on my shoes and I said Oh my gosh I even got gum on my shoes when I was there Well in those days the deadline was all was yesterday because it had to be done very quickly because it was just such a hype. So Topps wanted to throw one series after another onto the market. In terms of the quality of the series, in some ways I feel like in some aspects they kind of got better as they went along. In some aspects, they lost something, they became a little bit more busier, a little bit sort of more self-reflexive, a little less iconic than the first couple of series. I couldn't wrap my head around how do you get to do like Tom Bunk did and come up with all this stuff. He's so generous with the detail. And I thought, Oh, oh, here I am trying to keep things kind of simple and, and all of that and I guess - I don't have to but, then I would feel lazy when I look at his pictures. Oh shoot. So he'd bring these cards in and have a big meeting with Arthur Shorin and Arthur Shorin was the CEO of Topps. For a corporate guy he was... he had a very good sense of humor. I've worked for a lot of other corporate guys that I wish had Arthur Shorin's sense of humor. Who... really took an Arthur Shorin to be able to say not only - Let's do this fuck-you product. But yeah I think it's funny to see that kid blowing his brains out. Show me more like that. Not that Arthur's ideas themselves were always that good. He was always saying "Put in underpants. Underpants are funny." And it's like "they're really not." But we tried to include underpants thing for Arthur every once in a while. We always made extra cards. Some of them we kind of knew would probably never get printed but we figured what the hell. And sometimes we pushed the envelope a little bit and sometimes we were surprised that Arthur said "Great". And sometimes Arthur said "No way". There was one with a little girl being pushed off of a diving board into a pool in a wheelchair which did not make the final cut. There was a middle finger card, as I recall. There was a number of cards that just for whatever reason, never made it into the mix. But that was something that we were sort of, that we always knew that we'd have a couple that we'd get a ""no"" on, so we would always keep an extra couple in play to sort of compensate for that. Occasionally Art would say Oh, We're meeting at my place on Canal Street. So instead of going out to Brooklyn we'd have a, have a meeting over at his loft on Canal Street and I'd bring my things over and there Mark and Art would kind of go over the art instead of meeting out in Brooklyn at the Topps factory. So that was a nice change. But uh, there I got to see some of Art Spiegelman's work that was aside from the Topps bubble gum which is really fantastic since he was doing RAW magazine at the time with his wife. Francois was there and I was introduced to the idea of him doing MAUS at his apartment. He was working on it while he was giving us GPK jobs and I never realized it would have become so historically important. My Pulitzer Prize winning graphic novel about the Holocaust. Which has... Certainly I'm grateful for what that book became, but it was really immersive and deep, difficult project for me while I was in the middle of it. One of the real ironies though, was as Maus number one is about to be published by Pantheon Books who like every other publisher in New York and New England had rejected it as an impossible concept. It's a comic for grown ups and it's about the Holocaust and it uses cats and mice. Thank you. You know, It just wasn't getting anywhere. So it was rejected by everybody including Pantheon books that eventually took it on on a second submission through the art director who I was friends with Luis Fealy who designed - was their top book designer in New York publishing at the moment. But one thing that they were terrified about was that it would get out into the world that I had done Garbage Pail Kids. They said "You know how hard it is to put over the idea" that this is a serious book about the Holocaust using cats and mice? This is really an impossible task. If we also have to explain that you're doing this thing that... is, are outraging editorial columnists, parents, and educators, and psychiatrists all over America we're dooomed. That's just like all of a sudden it's going to be Garbage Pail jews and it's over. So many youngsters have become so obsessed that the cards have been banned by some school principles from the West Coast to the East. Simply said If you have them fine, keep them home, Monday morning I don't want to see them in school. You can't even play with at recess time. What are you supposed to do just sit there? I mean, really. I think almost as soon as Garbage Pail Kids was out, it was criticized by educators, parents, psychiatrists and the like and had a few very negative editorial op ed columns about what a danger it was to today's youth. And that put it on the map. ♪ 80s Heavy Metal Music Plays While at the time in the '80s parents were very upset about it. And I think it was just in the beginning, where family life was changing where - when you see a kid with a knife or a gun it was like Look it's just for fun. Kids don't do that. But then around the mid-eighties those things were becoming real. Instead of just something that was made fun of, you know cupie doll with a knife or something like that wasn't funny anymore when you saw a real kid might be using a knife or a gun, which was happening during the '80s. Here's one from 1987, Acne Amy Connect the Zits. And find out what Acne amy found to eliminate her acne problem forever. And if you connect the zits you find it's a revolver aimed at her temple. So there you go. For a 12 year old kid that's really funny and dangerous. So it's great. Still funny today. We were doing this transgressive series and the kid you know hit the mark. The kids loved it. The parents hated it. That's where we wanted to be. We were making things that Topps that kids bought with their own money. I would like 2 Garbage Pail Kids. We we're not making things for librarians; We were not making things for parents; We are making things for the kid. So that was, you know, it felt like we succeeded. Because kids are kids and they just like to do, to see things that their parents say they shouldn't. And all that stuff: the bodily liquids and all the warts, and snot. All that parents say you shouldn't do and then you see it there and it's so exciting. Tom Bunk: This is Germany. Bubble Gum war. Torture sells no matter where you go. And, but they were forbidden and they didn't. That was '88. Oh, you go to jail if you're caught with them? No, but the parents were just too, too powerful. How do you feel about that? Are you proud of that? I am proud of whatever is against all these parents- all these guys. And this is so funny. This German newspaper and this guy was against this Jugendschutzer means he's a protector of young kids. And look how he looks! He looks like a Garbage Pail Kid! JEFF ZAPATA He does look like a Garbage Pail Kids, one with glasses. First I think that the kids could buy it themselves. It was just cheap. Something that like - I didn't think much about it. But when I went to look for jobs for children's illustration and I showed them Garbage Pail Kids - that was totally wrong to show it to them because children's books are made for parents. And this here is made for kids. And because it was cheap; it was like a forbidden territory. And the parents and the schools and all... people who are kind of limiting children in their freedom, they were all against it. So that made it even better, you know. I had the good fortune of having a relative, who is also interested in art and that's how I think I became interested in doing art and that was my uncle Andy, who was Andy Warhol. And he was always on the cutting edge of everything. But I remember when I first started doing the GPKs in like '86 - I showed him those. And he was totally enthralled with the idea and he kind of suggested that I should do these paintings really large. Not as kid art or card art but do them as large paintings. He kind of saw them as an anti pop thing, an anti-popular, kind of, against society in some way. We were bringing the counter-culture to a younger group of children. But of course it was the candy counter. We have some things in here like the Garbage Pail Kids bop bag. It's very heavy. Not sure what character this is. Here are some Garbage Pail Kids stick on pictures. The phone calls that we got during the Garbage Pail Kid craze drove us crazy because we just couldn't eat a meal without the phone ringing. In the middle of the night the phone would be ringing because of people living all over the country and it just was continuous and it was it was hard. You know the hardest thing in the Garbage Pail Kid thing to collect I mean outside of original art of course is Bukimi Kun, the Japanese ones. And I like that even in this day and age of eBay and the Internet and everything going on it's still hard to find something. Like these things you just can't find. You know because in Japan they didn't have Cabbage Patch Kids. So when they tried to release Bukimi Kun it didn't make sense to them they had nothing to compare it to. So yeah all the foreign stuff all that stuff so hard to find. I really enjoy the search. You know, they're so wacky! Like, look at this guy holding up these titties. Yeah. And so now we get into the green border ones. Green with soccer balls, yeah, So the Italian yeah... You know and it's just so crazy... they're putting a flag and a soccer ball on each one. I really tried to get Garbage Pail Kids from all over the world. And it was so hard. And the one place that I really wanted them from was Israel. And I remember speaking to one of the people at Topps, Bill O'Connor. And saying, I have to tried to get these they won't send them to me because you won't let them import them into the USA.What can you do for me? He said there was nothing that he could do that I said well then I'm just going to have to go over there and get them myself. I collect fun things all over the world. Lets have a closer look at North America, Canada, French Canadian albums. Columbia, Brazil these are all complete albums and seal packs. There's a few wrappers in there. Argentina, but all the albums are complete. Germany, Belgium test set wrappers. Still need the Dutch and German, variation UK set because I'm in the UK. French sets, the Spanish sets with the really good double packs. You know it's funny-even today if you go to the FedEx Web site you can't send Garbage Pail Kids to Mexico because of its depiction of children and degrading situations. So basically you can't ship turtle hides, marijuana, or Garbage Pail Kids to Mexico, which is pretty great. So very quickly it became a fad and a phenomenon. It was beginning to make a lot of money for Topps and this is when I got my lesson in etymology. Bonuses were being passed out. Every vice president at Topps, I wasn't one of those, was getting literally a one million dollar bonus that year for how well Topps had done. And the factor that it made Topps that much money that year was not the ongoing perennials of baseball cards or the bubble gum that was coming out year in year out... But the Garbage Pail Kids that had become this giant cash cow. Like me and a few other people had managed to bring down this dinosaur. It got eaten to the last morsel by the people who had nothing to do with the Garbage Pail Kids who worked on the baseball cards or God knows what else. But at least some scraps were tossed to us. At that point I got somewhat disgruntled. The artist might have even gotten small bonuses but I remember getting I think it was a $25,000 or maybe it was even $50,000 bonus which to me was all the money in the world. But when I heard about the million dollar bonuses that had been passed out, I understood that the root word of bonus was bone. I don't remember specifically what series we were working on. It was well into it maybe at the halfway point. I do know that I walked into the office one day and everything I'd been working on was just gone. And I guess there was a discovery process, and pretty much everything on my desk was considered discovery. So all of my piles of sketches going back to series one vanished. And that's how I heard that Topps was being sued by OAA, Original Appalachian Arts who were the Cabbage Patch people. It's the gross vs. The cuddly, the sick vs. The sweet. It's an all out battle for the hearts and minds of kids. What may have started out as a joke, is now a $30 million lawsuit. There are legal issues that weren't as clean in the Topps bubble gum world, which was to say that comic books were the lowest form of literature but by God they were literature. Bubblegum cards weren't exactly literature even because you were selling premiums. You're selling something that's sold with gum and added value to the gum, but wasn't exactly an editorial form because obviously the First Amendment was designed not for bubblegum stickers and cards but for dissident opinions in the form of newspapers. And as a result it came up against a different body of law that was beginning to tighten the noose around Topps from the moment that even Wacky Packs came out. Because now, it seems obvious in a world where corporations are people too. More so than people. But at that time there was something even more important than the First Amendment which was product disparagement. Xavier Roberts's has filed a copyright suit against the chewing gum company. My point is it's not to take my product, my creation, and tarnish it. And that's really where I'm coming from. Early on in working on series 1, I was pushing, not pushing - I was just doing that the first few designs as generic looking little dolls because I thought you can't make stuff look like a copyright or trademark design of another company. This is asking for trouble; this is asking for a lawsuit or something. But they kept pushing me to make them look more like, like Cabbage Patch. You know and, and uh, so I mean, but I can see that this is like a two edged sword. It made, it more appealing and more - it underlined that the title being a parody more by making the designs look more like Cabbage Patch. But I saw it coming. It seemed like the parody laws back in, you know back in that period were a lot tougher because we weren't even allowed to parody Cyndi Lauper in a particular series. We did that series called Hollywood zombies where we clearly were parodying the images of famous actors and actresses. And back in the '80s and '70s we were told you cannot do that. So things seem like they were much tougher then. I never liked the fact that we couldn't do parody. I mean Mad did it for years and I felt we should have that same freedom that Mad Magazine had. We were publishing artwork and humor you know and why, why could Mad do this this and we can't? And then we were told well Mad's a publication and there's different laws of parody. Which have to do with undermining the value of a trademark. And that trumped the idea of the right to parody. But when Wacky Packages were coming out we would frequently get cease and desist orders from Kellogg's cereal or Pepsi Cola. And we had to stop. Because we were actually told parodying the trademark is more serious than parodying an idea or a concept. Well we were being sued, you know... by what we viewed to be a hostile court. This was a Georgia company. And the trial was going to be held in Georgia. In the suit we had to turn over all our early files to the enemy camp. Ultimately I had to go down to Georgia to give a deposition for the attorneys for Cabbage Patch. And I was really strung out about that. I wasn't looking forward to it. Just fearful I would say the wrong thing. Albeit the truth but yet get Topps in some worse trouble than they seem to be heading into right then and there. So the guys representing Cabbage Patch Kids they just kept asking questions and they have a court reporter typing out the transcript of the... of the conversation. John would submit rough sketches to us then we would send it back for a finished painting. And there was some note that somebody wrote make it more, look more like, you know - Cabbage Patch. And then they were digging through my papers and, sure enough, they found something that says make them look like Cabbage Patch Dolls. And they thought, Ah - we've got him! We felt that might have been like a smoking gun. We're waiting for it to go before the judge for the case. So we hear different things postponing it and I'm sure this isn't right, but it sounded like the judge has to get a haircut today so you guys will have to take the day off. Or something came up so you know. Then after at least a week there we hear Oh, Ok they settled out of court. So you guys can go home now. There was some negotiation that went on between both sides after that. And they made a settlement. Topps ended up paying for the right to spoof the Cabbage Patch series. We agreed to pay royalties to the Cabbage Patch people for all the past series we did. And then going forward, we would be paying royalties. Plus, we had to make changes where it couldn't look quite as much like the original Cabbage Patch. We had to change it to look a little bit different. I think they they paid till it hurt, but it didn't hurt bad enough to stop us from going forward. That lead to finally have a logo being changed for the Garbage Pail Kids and the little arc lettering being turned into a banner and a few other changes in the physiognomy of kids to make it what it was which was now a phenomenon in its own right. I guess Tom worked up a model sheet -Tom Bunk of several, you know, several designs that show the new characters. They had to be hard plastic instead of soft cloth dolls and have different number of fingers and had to have little jug ears. The proportions were slightly different. They would have some random plastic cracks in them to make, everybody - make it super-clear they were hard sculptured dolls. So I just thought these aren't going to be as cute. I didn't like I didn't want to paint ugly dolls. I mean that sounds funny because we were trying to make them gross. But I wanted them to look, I wanted them to be real appealing and lovable despite the negativity of anything that they might have to do or encounter. I didn't like putting cracks in chunka joints you know. But that was it was the agreement probably. I felt that maybe Topps might have agreed to too much as far as changing the GPK look. I don't know how many we ultimately did with that design how many series we did but we did a fair number of designs. They were still selling. They're always selling enough for Arthur to walk into the room and say "Yeah we're going to do another one." And I think we ultimately did 15 or 16 series. The changes were subtle but it was enough to kind of, to kill the whole concept I think. ♪ If your teacher says you're bad ♪ ♪ And sends you to the principal ♪ ♪ You can be a Garbage Pail Kid! ♪ ♪ If your parents say you dress like ♪ ♪ You should be in a carnival ♪ We heard there was going to be a movie. Naturally, we wanted to be involved creatively involved and we were told we were not going to be creatively involved. Hey we're the the Pepsi generation! We met with Rod Amateau who was the producer of it. As I recall we had a meeting at Arthur's office one day where he asked us a bunch of extremely general questions about Garbage Pail Kids. It didn't really seem, he didn't really seem to understand what they were. But he knew they were hot. And I think he had a contract to fulfill so this was going to be his project. So, I think we sort of showed him stuff we were working on. He would ask some very sort of vague general questions about like this character or that character. But, it was, it was basically a very non communicative meeting as I recall. But it was the worst movie ever made. And Rod Amateau I think has admitted that the reason he wrote that was that he had a contract to write a certain number of movies and this was, you know, the thing that would end his contract which he wanted to do and that's why he did it. Well, I was working pretty regularly on a show called The Facts Of Life and had a career going, if you will. And it was the summertime and along came a film that I was able to audition for the lead in. And I was super-excited because there was so much attention on the cards at the time and I figured it would be incredibly popular and a great opportunity and I got the part I fit the bill for the character of Dodger. Little did I know that it would end up being quite the film that it was. I believe one of the memorable quotes from the critics is they called it "a stunningly inept and utterly" reprehensible film" - which it is - which it is." And I don't actually remember the audition but I was glad that I got the role of Valerie Vomit as opposed to some of the other characters because I can't stand bodily functions. I don't like them to be talked about. When I got called for the role I was called by a friend, I believe it was Phil Fondacaro. He said he needed, uh... uh the production was looking for six to seven little people to play some characters. And it was the Garbage Pail Kids. When I got cast for the character we went down to Atlantic Entertainment and met with John Buechler and Rod and they kind of looked at us and said You're this character. You're this character. I don't recall the exact casting process but I was honored to play Windy Winston. That was a fun character. In fact, I brought in a little of my New Orleans flavor some R&B, some Jazz, and some attitude you know. And that's how I developed the character. I like the counter culture of the opposite of the Cabbage Patch Kids. When you're my size, you don't get to play the neighbor. You don't get to play the lead. Very, I don't know why. It's just it's just one of those things... It would be nice if that happened. But we get to play some very colorful characters. Like Ali Gator - I'm green. As an ewok - I'm brown. So I was thinking of what different character of what he would do, maybe he'd be from like New York. A little bit of deng, deng... They said not that type of a character. Get it down a little bit more like dat - a little bit down and deep. So I started doing the voice of getting like dat. That was how I really started getting the voice. A little tough guy. Ooh, I'm spitting all over the place. Actually it was only my fourth or fifth audition in Hollywood. I heard of the Garbage Patch or Cabbage Patch dolls. But I was 22 years old when I auditioned for this. And all that stuff was well in a different world as far as I was concerned. I had no idea what it was about I had no clue. So my fart direction was actually a body movement or like a like a working it, working it And like finally going whohaaa. Ahhh, uh, Aaah. There you go - one more. Ahhhh... And I would knock the people down. You know - they like - be like - Oh my God! That stinks. I hung out with the director, Rod Amateau, the late Rod Amateau. And there he was the ringleader with all these crazy, little guys wearing these ridiculous looking Paper mache kind of heads. And he's like, you know, I don't have to do this movie you know... it's not in my contract to do it... Oh, that's, that's interesting. That's inspiring, a very confident building statement. And of course the movie wound up being pretty pathetic. But I guess it's become something of a cult movie over the years and some people like it. As far as the movies I remember getting in piles of like, snapshots of some very rough maybe armatures for the costumes and that kind of stuff. Obviously, you know, we were, somebody, Arthur or whoever was just approving anything and they were not soliciting our specific opinion. I know the makeup guys would need a lot longer time to sculpt the heads and then the different things because of the Topps would come in and say "no you can't do it this way" because that looks too much like a "Cabbage Patch Kid." And so they would have to change that up. So artistry that was tough on trying to make the heads and things like that of the different characters. Let's talk about the vomit. Luckily I wasn't in the head when the vomiting took place. It was like a projectile - it was a head - a different head with an enlarged mouth. That had like a spewing device I don't know what it was that pushed out the vomit. But it was pretty, pretty gross. I went to the premiere in Times Square. I was one of three people in the audience and there was a guy living in the second row and that was the premiere of the Garbage Pail Kids movie. You know what is it that is that is so breathtaking? Part of it, I think stems from it being a terrible execution of a terrible idea. You know the, the power of those cards is in the cards. You know, it's the each indvidual - the artwork. That's that's the strength of thing. That's why they sold. That's why people were in to it the ideas behind the artwork. And to try to put that on film, it just, it didn't work and it was a catastrophic failure in attempting to do so. The thing that's so fascinating about the Garbage Pail Kids movie is, as a as a writer now and a producer, someone who's had family films made. The fact they made that movie is so amazing because it goes against everything you would do in a family movie. In a way, it's like one of those movies you look back Mac and Me - there's these certain movies where you're like that was just a really weird period in the '80s where you could get away with doing stuff. And the filmmakers went for it in a really weird way and they committed and we're left with this really bizarre piece of family cinema. That I don't think there'll ever be anything like that again. You know hindsight is a powerful thing. So at the time I didn't have any idea. I thought I was making the Goonies. Well the popularity of the Garbage Pail Kids led to CBS wanting to air a produced Garbage Pail Kid cartoon on Saturday mornings. The American Family Association didn't like the sound of that. You know, here are these gross cards of kids farting and blowing up and killing each other. This is terrible for the children. The children won't like this. So of course They start writing letters and getting it out there you know. Boycott CBS. Boycott their sponsors! Boycott the advertisers! And this, you know scared the crap out of CBS. And for the very first time in history they actually cancelled a show that they've already produced, that was ready to roll. Just because of a public protest so it never aired, not here in the U.S. I very specifically remember being in a meeting where Stan Hart announced to us "That will never be put on the air." And he was dead right. Six months, a year later, it got up to the point of being listed in TV Guide but when that Saturday morning came and the kids tuned in for that show, it was not there and it never aired. So Stan definitely had the inside track on that one. Interestingly enough, John K, of Ren and Stimpy fame, you know, before he ever did that, did some presentation materials for his version of a Garbage Pail Kid cartoon which, God would have been awesome! You know, so, oh well. We just kept going on it. Working on, up through series 16 and I didn't know till after work was done on the 16th series that - hey, they weren't going to publish it. And the thing I heard was just that sales were low enough that they didn't want to do it. That's the story I got at the time. And then abruptly it just stopped. And that was in late 88. Another person that was working at Topps was a gentleman by the name of Len Brown who was a mentor of mine at the time. He was one of the guys who plucked me out of obscurity and said Hey, why don't you, you should do more card sets. The next thing you know, we kept on saying we want to bring back some of the old brands. Should it be Ugly stickers? Should it be Wacky Packs? Which one we should do? And... we started and, well let's bring back Garbage Pail Kids. Let's bring it, it's time. And a lot of the executives at the time were sensitive to the lawsuit. And because of that we were very sensitive about how we were going to go back to doing Garbage Pail Kids. And where were these artists? It's almost... we had to go find everybody again. So the idea was to do an All new series of Garbage Pail Kids. No wait, did they call it "All new"? Yeah OK. All new That's the right title. And it was basically going to take the unpublished 16th series. And then they wanted to add in, I guess it was six paintings per artist for myself and Tom Bunk to do new work. And Jay Lynch provided some very, very thoughtful, clear drawings and he's wonderful to get ideas from. And when we restarted the engine to this beautiful car that's called Garbage Pail Kids, 20 years later or whatever it was. We still had the same card, the same rules and all that. We knew like we have to do something different. And it took us a while. I... I... I... Once you started art directing and editing Garbage Pail Kids you really appreciated what they did in the, in the original series. And I actually used to dab a lot into the well of the old timers. Call them up, "Art, what would you do? And... Jay" Lynch, what would you do? Len Brown, what would you do?" I think there was a surprise after doing the work that they were printing, printed differently. Technology has changed in whatever the time was like - 20 years from, from '84 to 2003 there. And I thought, oh this is shiny paper and the colors so much more detailed. And it's like we had to kind of get a feel for it. We were doing Garbage Pail Kids, the second series and I didn't like some of the artists we were hiring that I was forced to hire. That were... and it wasn't that I didn't like them I just didn't think that they were right for this series. So I said you know what I think I could paint just as good or better than them and I went but I am not a painter. I'm not a good painter. I'm not - I don't think I'm good. So I did a piece, not saying it was from me, and it got approved and all that stuff. And then I said Hey, that's... I actually painted that, I drew that. And now it's Armed Arnie. That's how Armed Arnie came to be. And but at least it showed that I wanted to show them like, Hey I'm not a good painter and if we're hiring this we have to get people better than me. And that was when we got Brent. Out of college, I was flat broke so I moved in with my older brother actually and was living out of his basement. I'd been getting a lot of rejection letters from different comic book companies. And, um, but I was getting steady work to make it worth my while to. So then finally I submitted to Jeff and he sent me an email and then asked if I wanted to try out and paint a Garbage Pail Kid. And it was a Jay Lynch concept. It was really stressful at the time. Like I felt like I was finally making it or something Here's Pat of Gold here. This one is Leafy Larry. Oh, geez I can't remember this ones name. I think this one is Roll-up Ralph. That's this one - Roll-up Ralph. Jeff said "Hey, you know..." we're looking for GPK artists and also Wacky Packages artists. Do you think "this is something that you'd be interested in?" And you know, inside I was just jumping with joy. I had to have my poker face on because again I collected GPK and Wacky Packages as a kid. And at that time I didn't even know that the Garbage Pail Kids had came back, You know, I just thought it was just an '80s thing. The first set I worked on was 2005. But definitely remember drawing my own garbage pail kid and showing them to my mom - stuff like that and trying to fool her that they were real Garbage Pail Kids. So I remember that. And I just always remember carrying them around with me in a big stack with like a rubber band stack of cards and always just looking at them wherever I went and bringing them with me. And they gave me a really cool character: Split Kit, which was one of the original designs, which was like a normal kid and then just put down a half and he was like this little juvenile hoodlum. I think he had a gun actually. Which is funny because we can't paint guns anymore. When we get take the classic characters and put them in modern situations I enjoy. Because that's when it's really getting back into like OK, this is what I grew up with. I am now literally painting the Garbage Pail Kids I saw. Whenever anybody finds out I'm a Garbage Pail Kids artist the first thing they say is "you have the coolest job ever." So that's exciting. And I have been asked to go to my son's school to talk to the kids and I had them come up with their own Wacky Packages ideas and Garbage Pail Kid ideas. And my kid, and my son... he has his friends come over and they've been asking me to do Garbage Pail Kids for them. So it's pretty cool that all the kids around the neighborhood, are always trying to come in there and give me ideas or get their name in there or try to do something with that. Topps is one of the few places I worked at where you actually, physically will paint something. Most most companies I've worked for they want like a digital, something digitally colored. Really rare to actually be able to do an actual painting that is like actual airbrushing. Like physically airbrushing it. I like having to wear a respirator so you don't inhale fumes. It's a lot different than sitting on your computer. So my mother had passed away when I was 10 of cancer and my dad raised three boys: myself, two younger brothers. I mean I was 10 years old and Garbage Pail Kids came out in 1985 and that was it. I was into that. And yeah, my dad was very accepting. He was just, as long as we were happy and we kept to ourselves. It was good for him. And it was good for us. So, and it made us get along a little bit - between the times that we were watching professional wrestling and beating each other up, so. What's great about Garbage Pail Kids, each artist has a sensitivity to what sort of humor they're putting into it. And it really, when the viewer sees it, there's a lot of that artist's interpretation of the gag. Because you could come up with the gag of, you know, of some kid jumping off a roof, or whatever, but it's the way that the artist draws it and makes it where it's not dangerous, it's funny and he put's a sensitivity to it. I think that's what people get out of it. And they look at it and they have for a split second when they're reading it, they have a little contact with the artist who drew it, and that artist's interpretation of that event. You know, that's the performance of it and the artist never hears the clap. But I think hearing the chuckle here and there is worth the price of admission. Blanche, down. After high school I moved to New York to go the School of Visual Arts in Manhattan. I took a major in cartooning which is a real major, believe it or not. We had a lot of professors that were in DC Comics. They wrote and illustrated for DC, Mad Magazine. So we were trained by a lot of those guys in basic storytelling too. How to tell stories, how to come up with themes and so it was kind of like we were being trained as writers also. Which helps with doing the Garbage Pail Kids now because it is like, half of it's writing. We have to write a concept or a gag. You know come up with not just you know doing the artwork but come up with an idea. I still collect the children's writing- Children saying "I bought this and my dad and.." and I love the children letters because I'm like I'm glad kids are buying it because I remember when I was a kid and it meant so much to me to buy these things. So when I hear from a kid it's sorta really nice. I saw my first Garbage Pail Kid card in 2012 at Target. I was shopping at Target. And then I looked at this pack of cards and I said. "What are those, mom?" And my mom said, "They are Garbage Pail Kids; they are gross cards. But, would you like them?" I said "Yes." I was so excited. I can't wait. So I opened them in the car and I thought they were the best thing ever. I found out about them, I got into them, and I did not know there was old series. So I looked at YouTube and I learned there was more older series. So there's a lot of really neat GPK web sites out there. When I came up with GPKCustoms there was already Aaron's site GPK World which I actually used to discover the artists. There was GPK Underground which is a wonderful forum where you can meet other people who are interested in collecting and trading Garbage Pail Kids. So there so many different nuanced groups that you can find of any aspects of the GPK toys or the Cheap Toys or the pop-up toys. It seems to be something for everybody that loved GPK as kids. And I found these wonderful web sites that had documented every single one. And that's when I looked on e-bay and realized they are actually worth a lot now. That a lot of people hadn't kept their cards in such a pristine condition as I had. Well, you know the cards themselves now have a lot of value as well. I mean it's amazing what's happened, to find a sealed box of series one, first of all is very difficult to find. And if you do, it can bring anywhere from three to five thousand dollars. As far as the prices going up on original series boxes, they're not around that much. So prices have to go up. The individual cards graded, which of course, is kind of a more recent kind of thing. People buy a card and then they get it incapsulated and graded by a third party authenticator. And if it comes back a 9 or 10 on a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being - gem mint. A card like Nasty Nick, 1A, can be $3000. I do other genres besides Garbage Pail Kids. I do Marvel stuff. I also work on another brand for Topps, Mars Attacks as an artist. And there is nothing that comes close to the secondary market of sketch cards or original art as it goes to the Wacky and Garbage Pail Kids stuff. The original series- that art goes for thousands. The original art of these magnificent cards or you know only 5 " by 7" which is kind of interesting that they're not much bigger than the cards themselves. They're about 2 up. When you see them in person. They're so colorful and the techniques and everything used to to create these images. It's very impressive. I've been impressed myself by the prices they've achieved. Certainly, first series paintings can go anywhere from you know 20 to 30 thousand dollars depending on who or what it is. Which particular card it represents and was used for. Second series you're starting to see you know go somewhere in the $15,000 range $20,000 range again depending on which card. And third series, already at 10 you know $10 to $15,000. So you're really seeing you know heavy duty action on these things as works of art not just a collectible but people are looking at it in a different way. Now, Adam Bomb, the most iconic of all the Garbage Pail Kids obviously. In my opinion is the Mona Lisa of trading card art. Right? I mean you think about it, When you think about, the 1980s pop and culture in general, that is one of the iconic images. No question about it. So you know if I were asked to appraise the Adam Bomb painting, I would look at it in a very different light than the other paintings. And I've given it a lot of thought and you know if someone had it and wanted to insure it, I wouldn't insure it for anything less than a quarter of a million dollars at this point. Well one cool thing about being a GPK artist is that we get these these fan commissions and to some of the fans you know, money is not an object. You know, they'll be willing and ready to pay for whatever commission that they want. Hey Joe! James! How's it going? Nice to meet you in person. Come on in! Absolutely! Thanks man. So some of the artists that I initially found were those that just had Web sites. So Brent Engstrom and Tom Bunk were some of the first artists that I originally commissioned. Initially it started off pretty simple just single characters and then I realized that the thing I think everybody wants at some point. Is to have a Garbage Pail kid of themselves. And so I got a painting of my whole family as Garbage Pail Kids. And then from that I was like wow you can do a lot more when you have a full painting than these little cards. And so I started to think of what would I want to see. Well I'd want to see all the Ghostbusters! Well do you just want them all standing around? They've kind of gotta be doing something. So what are they going to do? So I started to imagine these vignettes. My wife is very supportive of my Garbage Pail Kid collection but she's not a big fan. But both my kids love Garbage Pail Kids. And do you like to draw or make your own Garbage Pail Kids? Well, I kind of have an idea in my head. I already got the name: Stapled Stan and he's like stapled everywhere. His mouth is stapled together. You know how some the Garbage Pail Kids have like their tongue sticking out? His tongue is like stapled. Hands, fingers stapled together, he's all stapled. He's all stapled together! The Garbage Pail Kids are jokes. Look - a cow jumping over the moon spilling milk. They're really funny to me. They're super dupe. It's a too-many headed baby. When I first got Garbage Pail Kids, shortly after that I was actually diagnosed with cancer non- Hodgkin's Burkitt's lymphoma. And so while I had the first series I didn't have any of the other sets because I was in and out of the hospital. And my mom knew that they would become a big thing. So she bought me more and more cards. Like there's a kid there with no hair and looking sickly and kids don't know if you can't catch cancer or not. They're just see - somebody sick and kind of run away. But I had these cards everybody really wanted so they were willing to approach me because they knew that, hey if you want to trade to get a Nasty Nick there's the only guy who's going to have one so you better go over and see what you can get. So, yeah it was a way that, that I didn't feel shunned and or an outcast at all. I actually felt like people wanted to be around me. I would never, never sell this card. This is part of my childhood. This is what makes this whole business of collecting happen, you know, is that attachment to things that you had, things that you lost, things that you never had, but wanted and now you can afford. That's what this is all about. So yeah, this one I'm holding on to. Aaron Booton: And I was like WOW these are sensational the artwork, the level of artwork to me was, that's what really got me. I don't know if there ever will be anything like Garbage Pail Kids in the '80s! 30 years later, are they talking about Willow? Nah, they're talking about Garbage Pail! That's what actors live for is for-I'm going to get teary-eyed - people appreciating their work. That's just the cherry on the icing on the cake! So thanks, you guys! But I did actually spend some time in a treatment center in the early part of this decade. It was great because I worked my shit out and that was good. Part of the treatment was that you go to you see a psychologist three times a week. And that was actually extremely, extremely helpful. It's part of a rehab facility where we talked to a psychologist and one day I, I pulled up a clip from YouTube of the Garbage Pail Kids to show the psychologist. And I swear they were this close to offering me a drink. I think one of the things that kids are missing out on today. There's so much access to information there's not really that phase in their lives where they can sort of explore that, that sort of adolescence that Garbage Pail Kids allowed you to explore. Where sure it's maybe not exactly what your parents wanted but it's not awful. It's just a little bit of dirt. It isn't dirty. But my dad said I am the patron saint of the '80s and Garbage Pail Kids. So I keep trying to go on and on to to get more people to like these cards because I think more people should have them. GPK has two things that I feel that kind of make up the brand. It's gross humor. And then there's also social commentary. And I think those two things, you're always going to have people that like gross out things. And then you're always going to have people who like art you know social commentary represented in art. I always felt it needs to be funny. If you make cool stuff you have to make it funny. So to keep the balance and this balance is I think was what was so good about it. That was... and we could have gone even more so. Because I'm... I'm left anyway. You always have to question the whole establishment. It is the establishment of this you know. If you don't question it, you'll get Adolf Hitler soon. It really did have an independent life after the giant success of Cabbage Patch, Garbage Pail became a giant success In its own. It earned its wings as its own phenomenon. Howard the Duck didn't make it, but I'm glad something did well for Topps. It feels good. I'm a little puzzled at sort of the obsessiveness that some of these people have about the series. I mean we were making these for a mass market. We were not making them for collectors. We were not making them for the zealots. We were not making them for completeists. We were making them for kids. And I think a little bit of that is lost now. It's much more sort of fan-focused. It's more narrowcasting than broadcasting. As being an art director for Garbage Pail Kids, part of it was being a psychiatrist. Every artist has their own problems, their own dynamics and me taking over such a brand. That had such a history. Being able to talk to the original artists that I grew up with and admired and finding out how great they are and also they helped teach me to be a good editor. I'll never forget it. I consider John Pound like a father figure to me. And if I get a little teary eyed, excuse me. But he's... without him I could never have done it. So, thanks, John. I just loved doing the work and I felt proud of it and loved that they had a place in the pop culture arena and in the market place. And that I had work in print. And that it was funny stuff and silly stuff. I'm proud of being silly! Philly Non-sport card show. We have our manufacturers here this morning as well as seven artists. Please come by and say hello to all of them. I started to hear back in the 1980s that trading cards were no longer a factor with kids that they were moved on to video games, computers, all sorts of other things, and they just didn't care to collect pieces of cardboard any longer. The turn of the century we had Pokemon and Yugioh and all sorts of products that made it big time on trading cards. So I still say trading cards are always going to be with us. It's the property you have to match up successfully on a trading card and kids will want it. It's cheap entertainment. It doesn't cost a lot. And kids love having stacks of trading cards of something that they love. So I, I think going forward in the future. Garbage Pail Kids could be around 20 more years from now with it's 50th, silver anniversary coming up. If you're making a graven image somebody might worship it as a false god. So the role of the cartoonist satirizes stuff and takes something that's contending for false-god status and drag it down to reality and show that it has feet of clay, that they idolize a feet of clay. That would be the job of the cartoonist; that would be the appropriate job of the cartoonist. So now you know, the thing you've gotta watch is, is that the images of the Garbage Pail Kids stop becoming satire and start becoming holy icons. That just exist in and of themselves. I see the same thing with Mad Magazine; It's become it's opposite. They'll print one issue that has different covers. And so the collectors will have to buy all the different variations. And originally they were a thing that was out there to mock consumer-culture and to get people to think about such things. And now it's a part of consumer culture. Things naturally evolve into that. But I try to avoid it. But then again I got to make a living so I don't know what I'm saying. Do you have fun with those? No...
