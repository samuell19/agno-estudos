I write to you all the time always, you see. Nothing else but this. Nothing. I'm writing maybe a thousand letters you, to give to you letters of my present life. And you, you'll do with them what I'd like... you to do with them which is, whatever you want. That's what I desire. That this be delivered to you. Where are you? How to reach you? How can we come close in this love, cancel this apparent fragmentation of time which separates us, one from the other? Listen. I'll never separate you from your body. Never. It's three in the afternoon The sun is out behind the trees the air is cool. I'm in the big room where I spend the Summer, Facing the garden. On the other side of the glass there is a forest of roses and for three days there's been this cat skinny, white, who has started looking at me through the glass, eye to eye, he scares me he cries he is lost he wants to belong and I don't want to any more. Where are you? What are you doing? Where are you lost? Where were you lost while I cried that I was scared? They say that you live on one of the islands next to France and other places too They say you're in an equatorial land where you died a long time ago, in the heat, buried in the charnel of a plague or even in that of a war or even that of a camp in occupied Poland. To me, it's all the same. I see your eyes. I see the sky in a river is a blue of the same colour, liquid and blue as your eyes. I see that it's not true that while I write to you nobody has died, And that you are there, you too in this empty continent. It's Summer here. Did you love the Summer? I don't know anymore. For myself I don't know any more. I don't know any more if I loved it outside of you. Do you remember? This word. This country. This dark land. You used to say: nothing remains but this path. This river. How to get back to our love. How? The light has sunk it seems behind the trees there's a wind It's turning cooler. The garden is full of birds and the cat becoming crazy with hunger. And to me, it's all the same. The roses are going to die very soon now It's fading out on the other side of the glass. The sky, above the river will become dark. Night is falling on the cat, leprous starving frightening On the garden so still around him the night also falls. I see it. It spreads over you, over me, over the river. Can you still see? You can no longer see, perhaps? They speak They say that everything had been built on the land. That it's all been lived in, occupied, by peoples, by governments, That there were palaces on the banks of rivers and between the palaces, thickets of nettles, brambles, and swarms of running children. And women, starved thin. That there were islands. And temples. That there was a forest. I know nothing of generalities, of peoples and of the world. None of them can stand in for you for this preference that I have for you. None. Listen, under the arches of the river, now, the sound of the sea those of the dark cave and the cries of that leprous cat you know, the one blind with hunger and who calls out across time. Do you hear it? No? Perhaps you hear nothing more? No? Keep listening. Try. How to come to the end of our love? Listen. under the arches of the river, this surge. Keep listening. This apparent fragmentation that I just told you of has gone. Together we need to come closer to the end. To that of our love. Don't be afraid. It's strange, this look that the river gets sometimes in the clarity of night of going towards the sea racing to completely lose itself... But who are you? But who? How did this come about? How will this come about? Don't you still hear? In London, in the course of this plague? You understand? Or of this war? In this camp of the German "East"? In this Siberian one? Or in these islands, here? Here, you understand? No? Me, I don't know anymore. I know only of this love that I have for you. Complete. Terrible. And that you're not here to free me from it. Never. Never, do I separate you from our love, from our story. Many have been killed here. It's said. Killed, yes. Did you know that? Nearly every day. For a thousand years. Thousands and thousands of years. Yes. One time. A thousand times. A hundred thousand. The river all bloody. They shed blood, they imprisoned they wounded. A thousand years. It's then, yes, after, that all this was produced - for a very long time nothing. And then, of a sudden, your eyes. Your eyes on me. First, the liquid and empty blue of your eyes. And then, you saw me. On this cat, skinny and crazed, night has now fallen. On me, your form. You know, they say it was crematoria, near Cracow, that your body was separated from mine... as if that was possible... They say anything... they don't know... [they know nothing...] Listen... The cat, he's crying. Hunger and wind are eating him up through the tears, the cat in wind and hunger, the dark garden He cries in the dark cave... Listen... We say he complains... As if he was speaking... What? What was he saying? What word? What designation, senseless? inept? I do not separate you from your body I do not separate you from me. You used to say: nothing remains this city our dark land So temperate, have you forgotten? Have you forgotten everything? You used to say: the histories draw out the length of the river. You used to speak of their riverine monotony so sweet it calls you to lie down next it and to leave with it. Yes. You've forgotten everything. Everything What to do so that we shall have lived this love? What... to do so that this love has been lived? A fog is gathering in the garden. It spreads over the river. I see. The cat no longer crying. He is dead. Cold and hunger. It's strange... It's by way of that cat, skinny and crazed now dead by way of the garden so still around him that I reach you. By this white whiteness, this infinite fog that I reach your body. My name is Aurelia Steiner. I live in Melbourne where my parents are teachers. I'm 18 years old. I write.
