'...like merman and mermaid. 'The whispered promises... '...cheeks tanned in the sun pressed together... 'The secrets we shared... '...make me want to sigh. 'Ah, the joy of love... '...the long rose-colored days... 'The first time I ever saw you... '...on that vacation of love.' See you later! At the beach! I'm back! Hi. Here. That's rare... I usually have to ask to see your report card. Just look, will you? My average is up a point. I want a record player. There's a new compact one out. The only mark that's gone up is Phys-Ed! What about math'? No! Not a chance! You promised if my marks went up! Phys-Ed isn't a real subject. And we've got a record player! That thing?! I want to listen on my own! I'll get a job, then. Talk to Auntie for me. That liar! Great! No one's here! 'In Lane 1, Nishimiya!' 'On your marks, get set... go!' The winner! You're late! What are you doing here? It's clone! Here, Mizu. Especially for you. Why, thank you! Oh, yuck! Myu'? Myu! Have you seen Myu'? No, now you mention it... She hasn't been here since yesterday. She's never done that before. I didn't boot her out. Do you kick her?! No! 'Myu"? A stray cat she feeds. She just doesn't like being 'owned'. I know what's happened... she's in heat! 'Oh so quietly... '...the black petals fall...' Now you're getting into it! There's Nagisa! What's going on? Noriko and I were going to study together. Study? You? She's out back. Have you ever grown! Look at her, Ryosuke! She sure has! Her mother's so small! She takes after her dad. He was a big man. That's right. Noriko says you were great in the swim meet. Where were you? Your mother talks and talks! Just like you. Like who?! What's this? For not coming yesterday. Oh, the beach! I had a stomach-ache. You can still eat candy. That's probably where it came from. I met a pervert there, you know. A pervert? Yeah! Curry rice or ramen noodles? Curry rice. Soda pop or Watanabe juice crystals? Soda P0P- Hirota Mieko or Nakao Mie. Mieko. Yeah? Why do you get tears in your eyes when you yawn? How would I know'? Shut up and make posters! I'm sleepyml need energy. Isn't that neat'? It's a new candy. You blow and it whistles. Looking for Myu. Answers to 'Dinner Time! ' Here. Come on! No one's going to see it here! You never know. There's someone over there. Who is it? Do you know him? No. But he was here yesterday. You know what I whistled? 'Yesterday, too?' Look at that red-and-yellow one! It hurts my eyes! OK, that one? That two-piece? She looks like a kewpie doll! For Whom the Bell Tolls Why do people tilt their heads when they kiss? Because their noses are in the way'? Maybe it's just white people. They've got big noses. Japanese could kiss straight on. Royal Park Hotel Mami! Oh, Nagisa and Noriko! I haven't seen you for a long time! Would you like to come into the hotel for some ice cream? Sure! I've got to help out at home. Nagisa? Myu! Dinner! Myu! Myu! Dinner time! Hurry up and eat, will you'? There'll be customers soon. I wish I had some ice cream... What are you talking about? Ice cream isn't dinner! Not for dinner... Get some at the store. All they sell around here is flavored ice. I mean in a glass, smelling real nice, melting slowly... ...with wafers and a cherry on top. I thought you liked the way the flavoring turns your tongue red. Yeah, when I was small! Did you think some more about turning this into a coffee shop? Don't be silly! Hello? Oh, hello. How are you? Just a minute. It's your aunt. She's got a job for you if you want one. I'll go tomorrow! Hello, Nagisa. I'm working at the Sea House, so Mom said to get my hair cut short. You should've come yesterday! That's right! They had a real sundae! What did you say was on it? Three scoops in a tall glass... ...with banana and orange, topped with whipped cream... ...and even chocolate, too! She remembers everything about it! Mami's mom said to bring you next time. There you go! I can't. I'll be working. I'll go instead. She's a pretty woman. That's enough out of you! You can take some time off. Did you know your mother used to work at the hotel? Kind of. She was their star waitress. She really drew the customers. You'd be welcome there. I used to go there a lot myself. Ryosuke! I've got to go. I'll come back later. OK, watch how I do it. All right, here we are! Who ordered the hodgepodge? The young lady? Special today, an extra-large helping of...mustard! Honey, that bathing suit looks lovely on you! What are you blushing about'?! Don't look so happy! Drink up before the beer gets warm! See you! One ramen noodles! Right! OK, Nagisa. Second table on the left. Say, 'Here's your ramen ,' and smile! Lots of charm. OK, off you go! That's for here? Great! Set'er down. Set'er down here. I'm starving! Ow ow ow ow ow! Get me a cloth! Sorry, sorry, sorry! She's new here. Don't look at me like that! I'm an old softie at heart. Soft in the head... Oh, dear! Thank you! We're here with the beer! No, the curry's here. The pickled onions are free! Get as pickled as you like! Wow! He laughed! Hey! What a great big man like you needs is a cold beer! Hurt your foot'? You sit here and rest. Beer'? Coming right up! Here's your fried soba noodles. We gave you the special large serving... ...of red ginger. Oh, man... Gotcha! That's how you do it! But then, smile. Rememberjcharm'! There's today's pay. Thanks! Bonito! Give me some, too! Sorry! That was the last of it. Have some squid, on the house. Why all that lipstick tonight? Now, you stop that! Oh, stop! Have a drink. I'd love to. Hey! What's going on here? You be quiet! Ah, that tastes so good! P,“ “In In Y We V! 'Oh, dear!' 'Oh, stop!' I can't talk like that! Nagisa! You've gotten so big! Reiko? Yep! Hodgepvdge! Need another beer? Please! Coming right up. Another one over here, too! OK! Where'd you learn all that'? Not at your school, that's for sure! Don't copy her! Like a stray cat! Ups and leaves, ups and comes back! Here. Will Myu ever come back? Rather Myu than Reiko! Mom! The bill! Didn't they teach you to add at school? Don't give me that! The most important thing in life is not taught in school! You know what the most important thing in life is? Huh? What'? Oh, isn't this cool'? You saw me, didn't you? Getting out of that car? When you kissed that... This is him! Cool! That's it! What's important is...passion! Why are you always watching me'? I'm not. Then what? I'm beachcombing. Beach-what? Picking up things the tide washes up. I collect them. Doesn't this look like a dinosaur bone? And then... Wow! Yeah? Does that have a stopwatch? Yeah... Get set... Go! Go! Well? 1240. A personal best for Nishimiya! Really? I don't know. Oh. But I'm sure that's the fastest. What's your name'? Takewaki Hiroshi. I'm Nishimiya Nagisa. Don't you swim? I'd like to, but I'm lousy at it. I'll teach you, if you want. Thanks. Are you at the hotel? No. We've got a place. A cottage'? Sort of. But why aren't you on the big beach? That's where all the Tokyo people go. I go if it's cloudy. Otherwise it's too hot. You've got to get a tan! It's summer! 'On the hot sand... '...all glittering gold... '...let's make love naked...' 'The whispered promises... '...cheeks tanned in the sun pressed together... 'The secrets we shared...' 'Ah, the joy of love... '...the long rose-colored days... 'The first time I ever saw you...' We see you! They're in love! 'Nagisa's got a boyfriend!' Uh-oh! Let's get out of here! Who threw that?! Who threw this rock'?! You'?! I'm asking you! It almost hit the sacred relic! Who was it?! That tomboy Nishimiya again? It was me. Through me the Gods... ...punish you! Idiot! This is a holy place! Hodgepodge and fried soba I Nagisa! There's Mami, from the hotel. She's back for the summer! Don't come in here! Hello. How have you been? You've gotten so pretty! Noriko, you look healthy. Can we have a bill? Coming! Sit down. Plain and pork! Here you are. Plain curry and pork cutlet curry. Wow! Just like a real waitress! Isn't she? Mami said since you wouldn't come over, we should come here. Oh, that boy from the beach broke some glass at the Shrine. The Priest got real mad at him. He's a bad kid. Are you going to order something? I'm busy. Here's some ices for you. My treat! Come and sit here. You're working hard! Yeah. You know, that hairstyle isn't quite you. I'll get it cut. Not in a pagebvy! Sit down. That's it! It's you! Wow! Get a perm. Yeah! Pageboys look so dumb! It's him! Tatsuya! You've come to take me away again! Are you 90mg? For a while. Want to come? What'? Sure! Go! Go! Go! With the wind in my hair! Wait for me! I'm coming! Hey, that's mine! I'm buying it! Don't worry. There'll be another one in soon. I can wait. Let her have it. But... Well, if you don't mind... No. I don't mind. You want it, don't you'? No. I don't have the money yet. Wait a minute! I don't want it that much anyway. Oh, stop acting so nice and just buy it. You're rich. Hey, is that man watching us'? The guy who was in the store? Yeah. I'm being watched. Come on! He's what?! Hey! Free at last! Who was he? A Tokyo University student. Tokyo University? ls he your private tutor? He's a pest. Mom likes him, and he takes advantage of it. Schools in Tokyo must be hard. It's like being in a fish tank. Yeah, but at least people don't catch you and eat you. You can get a part-time job and go riding in someone's car...you're lucky. Maybe. Doesn't this fish remind you of your tutor? Kind of slick and slimy? Really! That one's Noriko. Exactly! And that's Reiko. Bright colors and real loud. Yes! And then... The guy in the car? You like him, don't you. No, I don't! That's Reiko's boyfriend. It's OK. I won't tell. It's you I wanted to hang around with, you know. Not Noriko. She's so boring! Did you go somewhere after work? Yeah... ...uh, no. I had to stay a little longer. The Tokyo boy's at the beach. He said you'd teach him to swim. 'Bye! Oh, hi. You got yelled at, huh'? A rap on the head, too. I'm sorry. I was chasing those kids and I didn't notice. That's OK. It was kind of fun watching him go blue in the face. You're brave. We're all scared of him. To make up for it, I'll coach you till you drop! Get your head further into the water! Don't be afraid of the water! Kick harder! Like a frog! Like that. 30 seconds more! Keep going! Hey! Show some guts! With guts you can do anything! Here yOU 9°! Do you know where Myu went? Watch it! R" get you! Pick out one you like. This one? I wore it at my piano recital. It's nice. Try it on. Enter when the music starts. OK. Mami... Ready? Yes! Isn't that pretty! You look more and more like your mother. She was lovely. You two were rivals. Maybe. Anyway, leave us alone now. Yes, ma'am. Have fun. That was a surprise! A slight interruption. It suits you. Turn around. But isn't it weird'? If my dad had married your mom, my mom's rival... ...you'd be living here now. You'd be their daughter. You'd be me. Today's stone. Three more meters. Has anyone called about Myu? No. I wonder where she went? Maybe she didn't like it here. I doubt that. She always had fish to eat, and you were always nice to her. Maybe she was born in a really classy house. She had a very refined face. Don't be silly! Oh, I wish it weren't so hot! Hot! Hot! Hot! Hot! Hot! Some 'rival' you are! What'? It's too hot! 'Bing! Clang! Rumble! "Hold it right there!' 'Bam! "Run!" Clank! Clank!' Shut up! He was big, with a lot of muscles. When he picked me up... ...his whiskers hurt, and he always smelled of sweat. That's natural, if he was on a fishing boat all day. When he didn't go out to sea, I'd always follow him around. You loved him... Yeah. He wasn't a pain, like my mother, and he was handsome... ...he'd buy me cake... ...not nice ones like this, mind you. He said when I grew up I could come work on the boats with him. Then when I was in Grade 2... ...there was a typhoon, with lots of wind and noise and big waves. I'd gone to bed. Then suddenly they woke me up... And then... You can have mine, too. Oh...OK. I'm sorry. It's just so... Let's always be friends. I wish we could trade places. I don't know about the studying, but the rest might be nice. You only see the surface. You see those two'? Those two? Have you ever seen someone kiss? NO...Uh, yes! How? Well, like in a movie, they put their heads on a slant... The movies lie. They do? Yes. --They make me sick! --Mami! I wish I was born in your house! I'm sick of being the daughter of a family that's all a lie! It'll be OK. Don't worry. I'll handle it' So... ...means 'l love you,' but if you say... ...it changes to 'I rub you.' 'l rub you'? Oh, dear! Listen... Which is it? 'L love you.' Nope. It's 'I rub you.' Stop that! It's not right! Mami's upstairs crying! How do you think she feels? Again? I don't know what she's told you, but this man is my nephew! I'm sorry. Mami reads too many novels. I'm always finding myself playing a role in some drama she's made up. Usually the villain. What role has she got you playing, Nagisa'? I'm back! Are you blue? Not any more. Great. We're going to have a beach party! A Party? Want to come? Sure! --It's at night... --That's OK. --They'll say you're bad... --I don't care! Great. See you! Here you go! Ramen! That's what I want! Great! With an extra-large pork slice. Hey. star! How's Reiko? Did you see her? I just wondered if she'd called. She's off somewhere...she was born in the year of the cat. 'The cat'? That's what she says. She's really the year of the boar, but she didn't like it so she changed it. I see. Kick harder... Breathe slowly... Yeah, like that. Almost there! Keep going! OK! Great! Next time we'll set your goal a little further. OK. At this rate you'll be able to reach that rock soon. Can I do that? That's your final goal. I'll show you how it's done. Oops! I almost forgot. Sorry! Don't worry. I've dropped it, too. Anyway, I don't want to wear it. It'll ruin my tan. What's wrong? I've never been so tanned, or felt I'd really done something before! I'm going to swim to that rock! That was a movie kiss, not a real one. Watch! What'? Nothing. Thirsty? No. What do you think I should do with my hair'? I told you, go ask Noriko's mom. Hmm...Noriko's mom... Having fun? Is what fun? I don't know...l just get the feeling that something nice happened. Well, some things are fun... What about you? Yeah, some things are fun... Hello? Oh, hello, Mizu! I've been waiting! Where are you? Sure! Whenever you like! Come on over! Oh, dear! Hi! Let me borrow Nagisa tomorrow! At the harbor, after work. 'Bye! I hate to have to do this! Wait a little longer, OK'? Sorry! How? Like this! Like Hirota Mieko! That doesn't really suit you... Then make me a bad girl! Huh? Right! Leave it to me. Oh, no! Hiroshi! I've got something wrong with me today. You practise, OK'? No! Stop! Stay there! Put your hat on and pull it down over your eyes so you can't see. Don't ask why. Just do it, OK? OK, I did it. Your breathing's gotten better. I practised. What's wrong? I just can't come today. Tomorrow I'll work you hard. OK. See you, then. 'Bye. 'The whispered promises... '...cheeks tanned in the sun pressed together...' When the song ends, you can take it off. OK! 'The secrets we shared... '...make me want to sigh. 'Ah, the joy of love... '...the long rose-colored days...' OK! See you tomorrow! See you tomorrow. Here they come! Hi! I'm not going anywhere with you! I mean it! Don't worry about it. It happens all the time. Hop in. Is it OK'? She'll come later. But... Don't sweat it. She's nuts about me, and believe it or not, she's very responsible. She won't leave you by yourself. Are you alone? Where's Reiko? I'm with this girl tonight. This is Nagisa, my new girlfriend. How old is she? ls that legal? Just kidding. She's Reiko's cousin. Want some? It stinks, though... Don't just watch! Come and dance! Hey! You can dance! Leave him. He got dropped so he's blue. Isn't that Reiko? Reiko? You must be thirsty. The star waitress! I'm your mom's right arm. I brought some, too. Have one with me. Then I'll go and make up with him. Did you get a perm'?! You did! You got a perm! Hey! Did you see this girl's hair'?! A shooting star... Give me a pageboy cut, OK? Nice and short. Nagisa! Did someone drown? Yeah, a fishing boat found him. A boy from Tokyo. Do you know him? He broke the glass at the Shrine. It doesn't look good... Hiroshi... What's the matter?! What's wrong?! Hey! Thank you very much. Here's your Pa)'- I gave you a little bonus. Thank you. Another summer gone. It's like the sun and the sea are thinking of autumn already. Is Miss Nishimiya Nagisa here'? Yes, right here. So you're Nagisa... I'm Takewaki Hiroshi's father. He'd collect things, and keep the ones he liked. He wasn't very strong, so he preferred that to playing. I wonder what that is... it just looks like an ordinary rock. Maybe that's the rock I threw by the Shrine. The Priest yelled at him for it. I'm sorry. No, no, no...he was boasting to the maid about it. No one had ever gotten angry at him. Maybe he felt like a real boy at last. He had fun this summer. Moon Man Little Foot Thanks to you. Steak This one day he didn't put a stone into the box. Even though he'd dropped his watch in the water, he looked so happy... Want one? Oh, yeah...there's a new candy. Hold out your hand. What'? Try them. See? Subtitles by Ian MacDougall
