Ted. Thank you for taking the time to meet us. Hey. Laura. Alex, how are you? I wouldn't miss this for the world. Oh, amy. You haven't seen amy since she was a baby. I don't believe it. [Speaking in japanese] mommy, what did he say? Ask him. What did you say? I said "welcome, dear amy" in japanese. Want me to teach you japanese? Sure. Come on, let's go. How do you feel? Tired. Tired. Still a bachelor? Oh, yeah. Oh, god. You got a special lady. I haven't been able to find one. You're a lucky man. You're as lucky as i am. This way, baby. [Car honking] (alex) it sure is good to see my best friend again. Alex, did you have any luck finding us a place to live? You bet. Now listen, ted. I know you're into japanese folklore and the like. But you weren't fantasizing when you said you wanted an old japanese-style house? Not at all. No, not at all. That's exactly what we wanted, isn't it? Oh, yeah. Traditional. When in japan, live as the japanese do. That's exactly what i did. I found you a dream house. It's over 200 years old. It's got a thatched roof. It sits on the side of a hill. Oh, that sounds beautiful. I hate to ask this question, but, uh, how much? 47,000 yen a month. Sounds expensive. That's about $250, american. That's not bad. That's not bad at all. Well, the reason i got the house so cheap is the house is supposed to be haunted. Haunted by what? Don't worry about it, honey. Modern ghosts are friendly ghosts. Sounds perfect, alex. It would be good for him. Help you with your research. There might be an interesting story in it. Yeah. Amy. You guys stay close. [Alex laughing] see that roof? They don't make them like that anymore. Uh--uh, amy, amy, uh, first lesson in japan. You always take your shoes off before you go in a house. Sit down. Come on, sit here. Here. Now you go. I think she's excited. Yes. How would you like a second honeymoon? I'd love that. Hey, come on, you two. You got plenty of time for that. Let me show you around the house. Watch your head, ted. (Yoshio) hello, curtis-san. [Speaking in japanese] good afternoon. The house is cleaned top and bottom, curtis-san. Electricity and telephone connected, as you instructed. [Speaking in japanese] thank you for your courtesy, and my friends thank you, too. Thank you. Don't mention it. Now i say goodbye. See you again. Amy, look, this is-- honey, look. Alex, this is terrific. (Ted) beautiful, love the house. Sweetheart. Ta-da. [Laughs] (alex) western, laura. I'm glad about that, alex. (Alex) that's your bedroom on the right. Amy, yours is straight ahead. Go ahead, amy. Open the door. Oh, sweetheart. Mom. This is your bedroom. There's no bed in my bedroom. Oh, yes, there is. There will be a bed in the closet. (Amy) why do they keep it-- there. Because it's-- because it's japan. And you have a whole room to play in. Ok, i just found my study. It's beautiful. (Amy) is it real? It's real. It's real. Oh, honey, look. Alex. Alex, how can we thank you? You don't have to thank me. I'm just glad you like it. Now here, amy. Laura. Thank you, uncle alex! What have you done? What have you done? What do you think is in here, mommy? (Laura) don't you think you've done enough? Now presents as well? Just some housewarming gifts for my favorite family. What is this? (Ted) i don't understand. [Whistles] sake. Laura. Thank you. Pal. Thank you. [Laughing] oh, that's nice. Thank you for taking the time, getting us here, settling us in. As i said, i wouldn't miss it for the world. I know you have jetlag, you're tired, and-- you get out of here. You've taken enough time. My pleasure. I have to get back... oh, sorry, i-- that's all right. I'm usually not that clumsy. Don't worry about it. Must have been one of those ghosts we were talking about. Please don't say that. Let's say goodbye to uncle alex. (Laura) come on. [Crickets chirping] ted. Ted. (Laura) ted. What? What? The lamp went off. Why didn't you turn it back on? Well, of course i did that, but it went off again by itself. [Laughing] i know that. I did that already. It's probably just a defective switch, honey, or the plug's loose or something. Hold me. [Insects buzzing] what? Nothing. Who was that? Scared the hell out of me. It's nothing. I just thought i heard something. It's nothing. (Ted) come here. (Ted) are you awake? (Amy) mmm-hmm. Good. Then give me a goodnight kiss. [Birds chirping] [man speaking in japanese] [man speaking in japanese] [door opening] can i do anything for you, father? I am the monk of the zen temple, which you can see from the road. I know all about this house and lately have had disturbing visions about it. It is a pity you have chosen this house as your home. If you need me in the future, please come to the temple. I appreciate your taking the time to come and warn us, father, but i'm--i'm sure we don't have any problems here that we can't solve ourselves. Remember this visit, my son. I'll be waiting. Good morning. Hi. Guess what i found just now, in the bedroom. It's a netsuke. What's that? Uh, an ivory carving they used to hang from their belts. It's special, isn't it? Depends. Uh, this one looks pretty old. You don't like it. Looks old. I'm gonna keep it. For us. (Ted) is amy up? (Laura) no, no. She's still fast asleep. Off the bed, on the floor as usual. At least in japan she doesn't have as far to fall. You know, this house? It's really kind of damp inside. That's no problem. We'll open up the shojis and give it a good airing out today. I don't think it has been lived in for a long time. Mmm, maybe not. Doesn't it seem strange to you that alex never married? Nah. Uh, just hard to please. I don't think i'd find him hard to please. [Gasps] i'm sorry. [Sighs] i don't know why i said that. I--i really don't. It was an awful thing to say. Don't worry about it. Don't give it a second thought. No. That was awful. No. I'm going to go wake amy up. [Chanting in japanese] [camera clicks] [speaking japanese on t.v.] [phone ringing] hello. (Alex) hi, laura? Oh, hi, alex, how are you? I'm fine, thank you. Where's your old man? Oh, ted? No, no, he's in-- he's in tokyo for the afternoon. Oh. Sorry i missed him. The reason i'm calling i want to invite the two of you to a consulate reception. Oh, that would be great. Ted would be delighted. Good. All settled in? Well, sort of. Laura? Laura? Laura? Alex. When are you coming to see us? I want to see you. Soon. Right now all kinds of congressional brass are coming through. Oh, don't let it be too long. Uh-uh, no, i won't. Have ted call me. Did you hear me? Yes. I said, don't let it be too long. Uh... i'll see you soon. Sayonara. Sayonara. [Bicycle bell ringing] [people laughing] [insects buzzing] must you continue to work while we're eating? Honey, i've got to get this roughed out, corrected, typed by tomorrow morning. I don't want to work while we eat. I got to work while we eat. I'm sorry. Is it good, sweetheart? Mmm, it's good, mommy. The eggplant's delicious. I do appreciate it. Alex called today. Yeah? Invited us to a consulate reception. Good. Want more milk, sweetheart? Yes, please, mommy. I'll give him a call tomorrow. Sure, fine. You could call him but, personally, i'd rather not go. What do you mean? Why don't you want to go? Do i have to give a reason? I just don't want to go. Amy, careful. It wasn't me. Uh. (Ted) you ready, baby? Is this ok for where we're going? The japanese? Well, i don't know about the japanese, but this american thinks you look fabulous. Come on. Oh, the... the number, for noriko. Sorry. I'm sorry. * [Band playing] [crowd chattering] ted. How are you? Laura. You look wonderful. Well, let's have a drink. Come on. [Crowd applauding] let me get that? Champagne? Sure. Thank you. Ted, right behind you. See that guy at the table? The one with glasses. He edits 4 magazines. Oh, yeah? I think he's leaving. Why don't you go over and say hello? Could be a good outlet for you. Don't worry. We'll--we'll have a drink and we'll dance. Go on. You'll be ok? Of course i'll be ok. Thank you, alex. Go get him, pal. Well, would you like to dance? Yes, i'd love to. Well, beautiful blonde lady, what did you mean by that phone call? Take me outside. What? I said, take me outside. Sure. Fletcher-san, why don't you visit me next week in tokyo? I will discuss business and i will show you the ginza. I'm looking forward to it. * [Band playing] [speaking in japanese] over there. Right. He asked us to order. Uh... beer for me. Whiskey soda. [Speaking in japanese] what did you say? I ask girls for you. [Speaking in japanese] welcome. How do you do? How do you do? (Girl) oh, be careful. Whose drink? Mine. That's mine. Oh, very good. [Speaking in japanese] please? Sure. Sure. Please. Drink. Ted. You have a nice moustache. Mmm-hmm. I like your face. Would you like to dance? Yeah. Good idea. Stand up. [Glasses clattering] be careful. Oh, i'm sorry. This way, please. Who are you? What's your name? My name is otami. Otami. Listen, i got to talk to you about something. No. Listen now. Listen, here. Don't disappear on me again, otami. Don't disappear. Ok? Hey, who are you? My name is wakako. Help, you guys. Oh! Oh! Stop, for god's sake! Ted. Wake up. Wake up, please. Look at me. Look at me. Look, i tur-- i turned the water on and it doesn't come on. Then it comes on all by itself and it covers me. Just like the light. You remember the light? It's the same thing. Don't you understand? Where were you last night? [Sighs] you know where i was last night. I was with a magazine editor. Oh. Well, i hope you had a real good time. [Sighing] well, as it happens, i had a real bad time, and it's not getting any better. Amy, we're going out. [Bells tinkling] [moans] [groans] ted. [Gasps] [groans] [speaks in japanese] what? [Panting] [bells tinkling] [speaks in japanese] [insects buzzing] [speaks in japanese] do you speak english? I speak a little english. You like these noh masks? Very fine. Yes. I'd like to look. Noh masks, from noh plays. (Laura) noh plays? Noh plays, you know, like theater. Oh. Oh, you mean they're--they're masks that actors wear in stage plays? Yes, stage plays, long time ago. They're-- they're very beautiful. [Speaks in japanese] [speaking in japanese] (assistant) they are all made of wood. They'd look beautiful in our living room, won't they? Daddy would be a little bit mad, don't you think? Think he would? I would like to buy. [Insects buzzing] [faint chanting] [bell dings faintly] i'm glad you came. I've been expecting you. Now, let us talk. The house you live in was the scene of a terrible murder in the middle of the last century. There was a young girl named otami, who tired of her samurai husband, shugoro, and fell in love with a student of her husband. His name was masanori. Shugoro discovered the 2 lovers and killed them both, then committed hara-kiri. To get power over the reluctant masanori, the tale tells of the night otami visited the witch, old majyo. [Thunder clapping] [cat meowing] [cat yowling] [water dripping] [cat meowing] [laughing] [speaking in japanese] [speaking in japanese] [giggling] [screaming] [grunting] [groans] [shrieking] [wailing] [continues shrieking] hi. We're back. (Amy) hi, daddy. We've been shopping. How's my girl? (Amy) look at all the new things we got. (Ted) what did you get? What did you get? (Amy) new tabis and new getas to go with my new kimono. Mommy bought them for me. Well, put them on. Let me see them. Ok. You ok? Yup. You want a drink? You betcha. What's in the box? Why don't you open it? What do you want to drink? Tennessee whiskey, no water, no ice. They're noh masks. You know about them? Uh, not much. A little bit. This one's okina. No, no. Magojiro. That's right. [Laura mumbles] this is okina. Hannya. She's a demon. You can tell what this is. [Chuckles] this is tengu, he's the devil. [Chuckles] he's not really a noh mask. He's a devil god and a hill god. Honey, these are beautifully made. What did you pay for them? 50,000 yen. Did you say, 15? 50. You said 50,000 yen. You paid 50,000 yen for these? That's what i said. 50,000 yen, we can't afford for anything we can't afford? And you spend on something to hang up in the living room? We can't afford? Wait a minute. But you can afford to pick up the check every time you take out a bunch of japanese businessmen who have more money than we've ever seen. That's business. Oh, that's right. It's japanese business. Yeah, it's japanese business. It's how we live, how we make money. It's business. [Sighs] i am sorry. I'm sorry. [Sighs] you know what? What? All we seem to do is argue and argue. That's true. Let's not do it anymore. I love you very much. Me, too. Hold me. [Sighs] it's the best story i have come across since we hit japan. (Laura) it's a little frightening. I'm glad-- i'm glad your work is going well. Maybe you should write at the table. No, honey, this story is going to write itself. It's going to write itself. I'm not worried about it at all. Eat your soup, amy. What kind is it? Beef and vegetable, the kind you like. (Ted) i am just going to take it easy now. Just relax and enjoy dinner with my family. I got the whole story roughed out. Now it's only a question of finding the best way to take it in to a... ew, there's an awful face in my soup. Come on. Eat your soup for daddy. No. It's all right. Come on, sweetheart. I can't. Well, let's see. Do you see anything in this soup? I'd eat it. Come on. There's nothing wrong with this soup. It's just mommy's good soup. I'll get you something else. You don't have to eat it. Eat your soup. (Amy) i can't! [Grunting] yes, you can. When i say "eat your soup," you eat your soup. [Choking] eat it. Come on. What are you doing? Get away from her. What's the matter with you? Let her go! For god's sake, what's the matter? Get away from her. Get out, amy. What are you doing? Are you crazy? [Amy coughing] amy. Sweetheart, all right, all right, ok, ok. Let's get away. Please. [Amy groaning] please, please. [Amy coughing] [whispering] amy? Amy? Good morning to you. It's not morning, mommy, it's afternoon. Oh, it is? I'm very sorry. Did you have a good sleep? I had a funny dream last night. You did? What was it about? Tell me. Well, i can't remember. Oh, then it's best you forget. Huh? How's my girl? She's all right. She doesn't remember a thing about last night. [Sighing] thank god. Hey, come on. Yeah, i know, i know. Look, i was thinking it might be a real good idea if you both came with me to pearl island. You'll be back tonight, won't you? Yeah, but i'll be back late. I just think it would be better-- no, we'll be all right. We'll be ok. Sure? I am sure. You're going to meet her kids. I don't wanna meet her-- hi. Don't be silly, that's rude. [Amy mumbling] [laura and noriko, speaking in japanese] how are you? (Noriko) how are you? I'm fine. Ok, you going to go now? Yes. Please? Thank you. [Laughing] have a good time, huh? Take care of one another. [Children chattering] bye. Be a good girl, please. [Bells tinkling] [gasps] (hayashi) they used to dive topless, but not for many years. (Ted) some of those girls have been under water for 2 minutes. Sure. Fletcher-san, don't worry. We haven't lost a girl yet. [Whistle blowing] [speaks in japanese] [yells] [muffled voice] grab me. Fletcher-san, quick. Grab me. [Car honking] ok, n-no, no. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Noriko, hey, listen, i want you to stay here and take care of amy. Stay here, please. Ok. Thank you. Amy, daddy's had an accident and he's in the hospital. Is he going to be ok? Yeah, no, he's going to be fine. But i have to go and see him. I want you to stay here and take care of one another, ok? Ok. Be a good girl, bye. Bye. Bye.

As soon as i finish this we'll leave, ok? When you're finished? When you're finished? Amy has been gone one week, you continue to write and the things still continue to happen.

Laura. [Voices yelling in japanese] [otami crying] [voices continue yelling] [gasps] [voices shouting louder] [gasping] * [flute playing] (monk) demons and ghosts are not confined to your christian world. You moved into a house occupied by evil spirits, condemned by their karma to stay in the place of their crimes. Your daughter did see a face in the bowl. When she drank, she swallowed the soul of the gaki. Why did you not go home? I wanted to try to understand what was happening. The gaki will know you talked to me and their revenge will be terrible. You must go. All right. Laura? Laura? Laura? Laura? Honey, you scared me. Everything is going to be fine. The monk is going to protect us. Tomorrow we are going home. Please.
