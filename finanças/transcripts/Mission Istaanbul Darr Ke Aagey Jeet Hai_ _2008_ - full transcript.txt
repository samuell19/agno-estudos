The decapitated body of an Indian doctor.. ...was found today, by the police patrol.. ...In the southern Kabul province.. ...where he had been kidnapped two days ago.. ...by Abu Nazir's men! We have just received the news.. ...of two passenger jets crashing into New York's twin towers! According to the tape received by Al Zohra's channel.. ...Abu-Nazir's organisation has taken the responsibility of this attack! The one because of whom this truth can be revealed! In breaking news we have received reports that.. ...there has been a bomb blast in Angara talkies in which.. Pakistan police was unable to nab the victim. And all my companions from 'Aaj Tak.'. ...will keep you updated on this breaking news! In Spain's capital, Madrid, there were three bomb serial blasts! No one has still taken responsibility.. ...of the attack on the Indian parliament! But this issue doesn't put Dr. Mathur's family in any danger. People are kidnapped and killed in front of the camera! But why did you kill an Indian doctor? It's not just the death of an Indian doctor. It is a message for entire India from Abu Nazir! Then why doesn't Abu Nazir show himself! Why does he hide from the world? Abu Nazir's main cause is the Jihad (holy war).. ...and not showing himself! There are millions of soldiers.. ...that will come forward with one order of Abu Nazir! If you have millions of soldiers.. ...then why are you pushing these children into war? They are not children. They are brave warriors ready to sacrifice their life.. ...In the war for independence! Tarik! Yes brother! Why do you want to be a martyr? Those who attain martyrdom while fighting with betrayers.. ...they go to heaven! Do you know what heaven is? Yes, you get all the fried rice you can eat there! As much as you can eat, without asking for it! This tape! This is Abu Nazir's new message! Show it on your T.V channel! Your government would want that! Hey Ali, where is that tape? It fell there! Get out of here! Kill these betrayers! Greetings, I am Vikas Sagar! Welcome to Aaj Tak! The main headlines! Abu Nazir is the most dangerous face of international terrorism! On his orders, bombings are done all over the world. Suicide attacks are carried out! Abu Nazir's main target has mostly been.. "America, Israel and their allies. But in his latest video tape statement.. ...Abu Nazir has threatened India too! Today I have warned entire India! Leave Kashmir! Or else Indians won't be able to save themselves.. ...In any part of the world. This is the first time, Abu Nazir's tape is being shown.. ...on any other news channel other than AIZohra! Only on Aaj Tak! Due to the absence of Mr. Vikas Sagar.. ...the court overrules all the objections of his lawyer! And grants Mrs. Anjali Sagar the divorce! Dear, I had told you.. - Dumbo! Papa! Now it's very late, Vikas! You are the most selfish human being I have ever met in my life! No, Anjali, no! Whatever I did till now, was just for both the of us! That's why you accepted a job in Al Zohra! And you didn't even ask me. That's just a three month orientation programme, Anjali! After that, I have to stay here! As the mouth piece of the terrorist! No Vikas, no! And anyway, what difference does it make? What does it matter, where you work! You are never at home! You are a journalist too! I was ready to leave everything for you! But you never even came home an hour early for me. And you arrived late even today! I am really sorry, Anjali! I am really sorry! No! No! No! Mr. Vikas Sagar! India's number one T.V journo! Born in Mumbai, education.. The Lawrence school, Samar! IIT topper! Computers! First job, trainee reporter at the Times of India! After that, television reporter! The pleasure is all mine, Mr. Owais Hussain. Soldier turned journalist! First job, Turkish Commando Force! Deployed in Central Africa with the U.N Peace Keeping force! Didn't like the idea of killing and sacrificing.. ...so left the army and joined CNN! From warrior to war correspondent! No, that's not it! But you journalists take Kashmir's name.. ...only when something bad happens there! You mean to say there are no public protests.. ...against the blasts, attacks and army atrocities! There are! But there is much more happening! In the last two years, the number of tourists.. ...have increased three times! Investments in millions can be seen! But until there isn't a blast or an attack.. ...you don't consider it a sensational news. What do you have to say about Al Zohra's new tape? There is normalcy spreading in Kashmir! And in such a condition, Al Zohra's tape.. ...sends out a very ominous ring! I am sorry.. what were.. - It's okay, as I was saying.. Please attend it, it could be an important call. I am really sorry! - It's okay! What is the matter, Vikas? I am busy! I have reached Istanbul. I thought I should inform you! I am feeling very lonely! Vikas, when we used to be together.. ...I would still feel alone! Everything is over between us now! Please don't call me and make me upset! Dumbo please.. please.. The one that's forlorn.. In the eyes! The untold.. that's in the breath! Narrate that saga through words. Let the heart's desire stay in the heart. Let eyes convey it! Or else.. or else.. or else.. we can be defamed. The one that's forlorn in the eyes! The untold that's in the breath! Narrate that saga through words. As I found you I was relieved. Life was filled with love! The heart found a soul mate. My prayers were answered. Immerse yourself in me! Always stay with me! Says my.. restlessness. Let the heart's desire stay in the heart. Let eyes convey it! Or else.. or else.. or else.. we can be defamed. Take my message to your American friend! Okay sir! These are the hero's of Al Zohra! Those who attained martyrdom on duty! They had gone to bring news. But they became news themselves. It happens only in Al Zohra. So, watch out. Mr. Gazni calls it his Hall of Martyrs! You do have a photo of yourself, isn't it? Why? Next! I am kidding! He is in the office, you want to meet him? Sure! As long as my photo doesn't need to be there. You never know! It maybe me next! Mr. Gazni, Vikas Sagar! Welcome to Al Zohra, Vikas! - Thank you. This is my chief of security! Zahir! Take a seat! I have heard a lot about you! They say, no one in India believes that something has happened. Until Vikas Sagar doesn't give the news. They also say, that until Al Zohra doesn't reach.. ...to cover the news.. the terrorists don't set off the bomb! There is always a different side to everything Vikas. And that's what we show the world. That doesn't mean that we support Abu Nazir.. ...or glorify terrorism! But we dare to go there, where no one else does! We give that news, which others can't! Our India operations are going to be on a very large scale! And I am sure, you will do a terrific job! Thank you sir! OWL - Sir. Tomorrow, you are going to Afghanistan! Afghanistan! The western journalists that have been kidnapped.. ...we have got an exclusive! Can I go too? Wow! You want to play with danger on your first day! Well.. We love that at Al Zohra! Show him the office and tell him about the 13th floor! 13th floor! What's that? The 13th is Zahir's department! Security department! No one is allowed to go in there. That's why a different lift goes there which asks for the handprint! Is this a T.V channel or the CIA headquarters? Don't be so shocked, Vikas! You can say that, we are alive.. ...because of whatever happens on the 13th floor. I didn't understand anything, Mr. Gazni! Al Zohra has made many enemies all over the world! And now they are all your enemies too! I hope, now that I have new enemies.. ...then I have made new friends too! Of course! Now that the work is done, let's party! Hi Vikas! - Do I know you? Now, I can't even sleep if I don't watch you. Everyday you come in my bedroom. And you don't even know who I am? Me! In your bedroom! Yes, I on my bed. And you.. on Aaj Tak! Okay! Lisa! Dr. Lisa Lobo! - Vikas! Vikas Sagar! Our past.. our future. Lies in our hands! Our past.. our future. Lies in our hands! Our life, our fate. Lies in our hands! But the time has come. When we should change ourselves. World! Hold on! Instead of messing up the future, open up inside. World! Hold on! Wonder you will have to answer the children of the sky. Sometimes.. think.. about life too. No one gets a second chance. Everyone.. everyone.. has lost their senses. World! Hold on! Instead of messing up the future, open up inside. World! Hold on! Wonder you will have to answer the children of the sky. World! Hold on! Madam, we've reached your house. World! Come quickly. Hold on. Hold on. Would you like to come up for a coffee? But then, I won't be able to sleep! Who is talking about sleeping, Vikas! And I am talking about being sensible! I like you, Lisa! - Really! But our ways are different! You want to move ahead, and I.. Hold on. Good night, bye, see you, take care! Good night! Vikas still loves his wife a lot! Football stadium! Is there going to be a football match there? A different type of game is played there, sir. You will know once you see it! I don't know about football match.. ...but we will surely meet Abu Nazir's men there! Come on, sit down! Let's sit there! Easy! Easy! Back off! Back off! Or I will shoot him! Back off! Back off! I said back off! Or I will shoot him! Back off! Back off! Or I will shoot him! Back off! Hey! Do you wish to die that you came back here? Enough games. Let's come to the point now! Open the blindfold! Sohail, what's the news? Northern alliance has passed the border. They can attack us any time! Are you okay? Come! Hi, we are from the Al Zohra news network! First, we'd like to know how long have you been a hostage here? And is there any message you would like to give to any of the embassies? Yes, we have been here for four days.. ...and we really don't know what to do! We really need your help! This is Abu Nazir's message.. ...for all the countries of the world. We will be triumphant! Abu Nazir's wrath will rain from the sky.. ...as destruction on the enemy's city! Which city? Which city do you want to target? Very soon, you and all the betrayers will know.. ...how Abu Nazir avenges the attacks on Iraq and Iran! What the hell.. What did you think? The one, for whom thousands of people can lay down their lives. You think you will be safe after betraying him? There is only one consequence of betrayal! Death! Northern Alliance! Come on, move, move, move! Move! Down, down, down! Come on, move! Get up! Come on get up! Let's go! Run! - Take them ahead! Come on.. run.. move. You are okay.. Come on. Let's go! Let's go! Get inside! Get inside quickly! Vikas, you go! Kill these traitors! Owais Hussain was Al Zohra's best journalist! But before that he was our best friend! He was the soldier of truth who has attained martyrdom. His obsession with truth brought him to Al Zohra! In the search of truth.. ...he went into the battlefield of Afghanistan fearlessly. And today when he has gone to meet Allah.. ...there is only truth in his heart! Today, he is not amongst us! But on his behalf, his companions at Al Zohra.. ...take an oath, that his photograph in the hall of martyrs.. ...will be a live example! Al Zohra will always remember you Owais Hussain. And we won't let the world forget this. Mr. Sagar, your life is in danger! Sorry! - Excuse me! A little careful, Mr. Sagar! Here, if you divert your attention even for a moment.. ...you can lose your life. Who are you? And how do you know my name? I even know why Owais Hussain was killed. Why do terrorists kill someone? Because they are terrorists! What do you think? Owais Hussain was the only reporter of Al Zohra.. ...who was killed? Meaning! Imran Baig! Senior reporter! Was killed in the Lebanon car bomb explosion! Javed Khan and ljaz Ahmed! From the roof of their hotel.. straight down! And Khurshid Alam was killed.. ...by poisoning his tea! All of them were Al Zohra's reporters! And all of them wanted to leave Al Zohra! But sadly, they are still hanging there. In their hall of martyrs. But.. why are you telling me all this? Owais Hussain wanted to leave Al Zohra too. He had told you, isn't it? You are leaving Al Zohra. - Of course! Did you tell the boss? There is nothing to tell the boss about. As soon as I get my salary, I will stop coming on the job. He will realize it himself. Whenever a reporter tried to leave Al Zohra.. ...he has forsaken the world. And still, there is a lot of space left.. ...In that hall of martyrs Mr. Sagar! But.. but how do you know all this? Al Zohra is not what you think, Vikas! Hey Vikas! What are you doing there alone? I am not alone, I am.. Come on, come on. Hop in, I will take you for a ride! Come on! Yes okay! 'You never know, it maybe me next.' 'Karachi, 10th July, 2003!' 'Al Zohra correspondent dead in car bomb explosion!' 'Whether they died in car bomb explosions.. ...or were abducted and beheaded.' 'But there is one thing common amongst all of them.' 'Everyone were Al Zohra reporters!' 'And all of them are dead!' 'Whoever he was, he was right!' What are you looking at so closely? Horoscope! What's written? I will go abroad, will get a new job! Soon I will get promotion! I will make new friends too! There is a chance for romance too, sir. Everything is mind blowing! I am having a golden period! Just that I think, I wish I could have given some of my luck.. ...to Owais too. You have suffered a very big shock.. ...seeing Owais dying in front of you. I can understand! Owais is our hero too! I have hung his photo in the hall of martyrs! See you around! Vikas knows something. - Sir. My India operations are very important for me Zahir! There shouldn't be any obstruction of any sort. I need him. - Yes sir. Come, let us go to our special correspondent Anjali Vakil.. ...who is in Srinagar.. ...where terrorists have held some people hostage. Come on, hurry up. As you can see.. - How many people are in the bus.. ...that cannot be said! There are more than 50 kidnapped passengers in the bus. Which you can see on your T.V screen! And the terrorists are hiding behind them! What do they want? What are their demands? That still hasn't been known! Ma'am, look behind! Follow me. Vikas, why do you always call at the wrong time? Anjali, listen to me. That man is a terrorist. I have seen him! Where, on the T.V? No, in Al Zohra's office.. In Istanbul! Vikas you must be mistaken, what are you saying? Anjali, I didn't make any mistake in recognizing him! Please go back! Please! Vikas, my life's biggest story is in front of me. Journalists from all around the world are present here.. ...and they have called me for an interview! And you are asking me to go back! Forget your freaking story and listen to me, Anjali! _Come! Something is going to happen, Dumbo! Please stop! Anjali! Please stop! Stop it! - Please stop Anjali! Oh God! Oh God! Oh God! Anjali! Anjali, are you okay? Anjali! Can you hear me, Anjali? Anjali! Can you hear me, Anjali? Dumbo! Dumbo, take the line! Dumbo, take the phone! Hello! Hello! Hello! Anjali! - Are you okay, Anjali? Speak to me! Oh, Dumbo, speak to me! Oh God! Madam, are you okay? Madam, are you okay? What the hell is happening here? You must have a lot of questions in your mind.. ...Mr. Vikas Sagar! But in this entire world, there is only one man.. ...who can answer your questions! Me! How did you come inside? Wrong question, Vikas. I can tell you everything! But ask the right question! Now, don't ask me what I know about you. Everything! And don't even ask.. what I will tell you about myself! Nothing. Yes, I can surely tell you my name. What is your name? Rizwan! Rizwan Khan! Now ask, who are the people who want to kill your wife? Because Vikas, if you wouldn't have called at the right time.. "Then, she wouldn't have survived. If you really want to tell me something.. Then do it properly! Venting your anger is a nice thing. But venting your anger on the wrong person.. ...Is not the right thing, Vikas! Take a look! You might know some of these people. They are the most wanted people in different parts of the world. Freedom fighters! That's what they call themselves! Rebels! Radicals! Oh no! The truth is that, all of them are terrorists! And the entire most wanted list.. ...can be spotted coming and going in your office. What are you saying? That all of them in the Al Zohra office.. But how do you know all this? I know a lot Vikas! But there are still things that even I don't know. But you.. you can find it out. By going where even I can't go! Which place is that? Al Zohra's 13th.. We saw the news on the T.V! Mr. Gajni has sent me to find out, are you okay? Tell me Mr. Gajni, if he cares about me so much.. ...then he could have called. We couldn't call you! Mr. Gajni has said, that he is very happy.. ...that your wife has survived. Tell Mr. Gajni that I am grateful to him.. ...but right now I want my privacy! Al Zohra is not what you think, Vikas! Any reporter that wanted to leave Al Zohra.. ...has forsaken the world. You are leaving Al Zohra! - Of course! Did you tell the boss? As soon as I get my salary, I will stop coming to work. He will realize it himself! 'Any reporter that wanted to leave Al Zohra.. ...has forsaken the world.' 'As the mouth piece of terrorists!' 'Your life is in danger.' 'And the entire most wanted list.. ...can be spotted coming and going in your office.' 'Tell him about the 13th floor!' 'No one is allowed to go there.' Excuse me. - Yes. I need to go upstairs, can you help me? 'Mr. Gajni calls this his hall of martyrs.' Someone went inside! Security! In the 13th floor's lift! Quickly go up! Security, go! Stop! St _ okay! _ Sotgp! Stop! Relax! What were you doing on the 13th floor? What's on the 13th floor, that you don't want me to see? How did you go inside the private lift? That lift.. mistakenly.. Whom are you trying to fool Vikas Sagar? What were you doing there? Tell me! I remembered! I remembered! That lift.. Are you okay? Why are these people after you? What do you know about them? I was lost in some thoughts! Mistakenly I entered their private lift! And then.. it set their backs on fire. Mistakenly! - They will never spare you, Vikas! What did you see there? I can't help you.. - I didn't see anything. Anyway, there was nothing worth seeing there. What did I see! What did I see! What did I see! Oh God, Vikas, they are after us. For the last time, for heaven's sake Vikas.. ...what did you see on the 13th floor? 13th floor! How do you know about it? And when did I tell you Lisa that I got down on the 13th floor? Oh God, they saw us Vikas. Oh no, Vikas! Just leave the car! Leave the car now! How do you know about the 13th floor? - Forget the 13th floor, Vikas! I will handle these people. There is a car waiting for you on the other side of the road! Save your life! Trust me Vikas! Just go! Go Vikas, go! Go! Hurry up! Good evening, Mr. Sagar! I don't think he knows anything! You need to work on him a little more! Come on! I had told you, no one is allowed on the 13th floor! What 13th floor! That lift malfunctioned! Otherwise, even this stupid bouncer knows.. ...that no one can go up without the handprint! Zahir was a bit too over excited. But what is there on the 13th floor.. ...for which I was beaten up so much? We are a T.V channel, Mr. Gajni! Is this the way! Vikas is not just our senior employee.. ...but he is also our guest. Is this the way to behave with our guest? I won't spare him so easily! I am sorry, Vikas! It's just that we are a bit careful with the security! Especially, after what happened to Owais! I hope you can understand! A souvenir given by the Americans. I was covering the war in Afghanistan! In the crossfire, I was hit by a bullet too! The bullet is still inside! Shall we start work from tomorrow? See you at the office, Mr. Sagar! - Okay, Mr. Gajni! Take care. Is everything fine? - Grace of Allah! The bugs have been planted, sir. Appoint the camera team in 24!? surveillance. Before he leaves, we should know where he is going. Right sir. Before he thinks, we should know what he is going to do. We should know even if he blinks. Yes sir! Go! Is there anything missing? Sir, is there anything missing? Everything is missing! My passport! My documents! My money! Everything! Hi. - Yes sir. Do you know a Rizwan Khan? Tall guy, long hair! Get Mr. Gazni to the command centre now. It's an emergency! We were having tea there at the table. You were serving us! Do you know him? - No, I don't know him. If he comes back, can you tell him to call Mr. Vikas Sagar. Yeah! Thank you! What's the matter? - We just heard Vikas talking! Rewind! Hi, do you know a Rizwan Khan? Tall guy, long hair! Rizwan! And, how does Vikas know him? Rizwan is in Istanbul, and you don't even know. How is that possible? We have kept an eye on Vikas from the beginning! We never saw him meeting Rizwan. Stay behind him! I want to see who Vikas meets. One falafel, please. Take your clothes off. - What? Do as I say? Wear these clothes, quick! But why? Give me your shoes. - Take your shoes off. Give me your shoes man. Just trust me. Look! Tracker! 1000 yards range. They must be close-by! Hurry up! Quick! He is in the garbage store. Go there you idiots! Too late! Will anyone tell me what's going on here? Your men are getting beaten up. You mean to say that Vikas is doing all this alone. Not Vikas! All cameras are dead! The bugs must be still there. I want to hear them. Sir that.. - What? What? Sir, they have dismantled all the bugs. 22nd May, 2005! There was a blast in Turkey! In that blast, 100 people were injured and 6 died. My wife and my small daughter.. ...were amongst those dead people. That day, Turkey declared war on terrorism. And the first soldier of that war, was me. I received the information that Abu Nazir was behind that blast. I am sorry that this happened with your family. But what how is Al Zohra connected to all this? And why.. are you looking for Abu Nazir in Turkey? I am not searching for Abu Nazir! Because Abu Nazir is dead! You go inside! But we still see Abu Nazir on T.V! Don't you find that strange? Abu Nazir was just another name for world terrorism. Just a face! The truth is that, even before Abu Nazir died.. ...there were people behind him, a network.. ...who did all the planning! And today, after he is dead.. ...the same network, the same people.. ...are just using his name! You mean Al Zohra! And those tapes. 13th floor! Oh God! Yup! So basically Mr. Sagar, which tapes do they re-edit.. ...to make new footage? Which special effects, which computer graphics do they use? How do they plan bomb blasts, terror attacks.. ...all over the world from within the Al Zohra office? You will get all these details on Zahir's computers. On the 13th floor. Then why don't you go? Anyway, you come and go like a ghost. Because I am scared. What? There is only one thing in the world that Rizwan is afraid of. And that's computers! But you! You are a computer expert. You can do this job. There are many experts like me. Then why just me? Yes, there are many experts. But no one is crazy enough to do this job. Whereas you my friend, have no choice. You will die Vikas. Either one way or another! You feel they will let you go. Vikas, whenever Al Zohra opens an office in any country.. ...terrorism increases there. Iraq! Afghanistan, Pakistan! Now their next target is India. Now they will target the innocent children.. ...of your country with their bombs. You are the only one that can save your country! Vikas! I will need a few things. Welcome to my home. Come on. But you said that computers. That's your office. And that! That's.. My office. I like your office better. I am glad that you do buddy. But let's get to work first. Let's save the world. Pen drive X' series. It contains hacking software. It can help us surpass their computer passwords.. ...and security codes. Really. After downloading the entire data.. ...It will leave a virus on their network. And exactly five minutes later.. ...all their disks will be clean. This! This thing will take care of that job. But before that, you will have to take me to the 13th floor. What about that? I will take you there. There are three problems in that. Problem number one, outside the building, 20 armed guards.. ...with automatic weapons. Problem number two, inside the building.. ...security checks, metal detectors and.. more armed guards. Problem number three. Upstairs, your best friend Zahir.. ...will be waiting with a small army to welcome you. Wait a minute! Hand print! How will we get inside the lift to go to the 13th floor? No Problem. Meet him! My friend! All the security of the 13th floor lies in his hands. You can behead me if you want! I won't tell you anything! If I do behead you, how will you tell anything? You can blind me! Cut off my tongue! I won't tell you anything! Rizwan! What the hell are you doing? Mr. Sagar, will_ you let me do my job! Go out and wait for me. Now! Free me! And you will know how I can use my hands! Your hands can be used too. Thank you! Rizwan! Are you freaking mad! He said it himself, he can use his hands! Shall we go now? But, what if this is the wrong hand? No! No! No! No please! No! No! No! So.. how will we go inside? You are serious! Why am I not surprised? Move! Let's go! Back up! Back up! Everyone back up. Come on! Vikas, go. Rizwan! - Go! 3110p! - Ok ' ay' okay, okay! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Come on hurry up, Vikas! Let's go. Shall we? Will you go out or die? Come on Vikas, show them what you have got. What the hell just happened? Security breach, sir. They have reached the 13th floor computers. Come on! Come on! Yes! What the hell, Rizwan! Who taught you how to shoot? The one who taught you to use computers. Hurry UP! Is it done, Vikas? New York, London, Mumbai! They are on our targets! Ready to be destroyed! How much time, Vikas? Done! Come on. What the hell is happening? Data has been downloaded on the pen drive, sir! How much? - Everything. Sir, they have put a virus in our computer network. Go! Go! Go! Let's go! Guys in the car, quickly! No Rizwan, she's with them? - Come on. Come on. If you want to save our lives then come on. I am there with you, we will deal with her later! Where is he now? - Escaped! Look at this, external cameras have captured something. Zoom in. Lisa! The one you trusted so much! She turned out to be the betrayer. I'll kill that creep! Watch it! Here guys! Here you go! - Thank you! I ask you for the last time, who are you? Or else I will throw this pen drive in water. No Vikas. I joined Gajni to find out his real activities. In fact, I betrayed you to win his trust. I work for the RAW! Research Analysis Wing, Indian Army! You work for the RAW! Give me a break Lisa, please. Vikas, this time I am telling the truth! In fact, RAW had asked me to recruit him! Recruit me. - Him! Not to fight. Vikas, we suspected Al Zohra from the beginning! But we couldn't find any proof! You could have given us a lot of evidence.. ...from Al Zohra's Indian office. But now you have made our work easier! Give me that pen drive. Sorry Lisa! I will handover this pen drive only to the Indian government. We've got company, baby. Check it out! Oh God! So.. are you scared? Ahead of fear lies victory! Yes baby! Let's rock it! Remember we want all of them alive. Until we have recovered the disk. Not bad Vikas, I am proud of you! Yeah, I learnt it watching you. That kick was pretty.. - I like that.. punch! Okay, we have to get out of Turkey! In an hour.. Call me! - Sure! Shall we.. The president's waiting for you sir! - Thank you! Come in! I am very busy, Reed! This is my first trip to India! What is so important? The Turkey situation, sir! Turkey! We have some kind of shortage! Not the bird, sir, the country. Oh - Seems some Indians are involved in the attack.. ...on the Al Zohra building. Indians! What are Indians doing in Turkey, for Christ's Sakes! They are everywhere! So they are. The other day I spent two hours talking about the Afghan problem.. ...with the Indian ambassador! Anyhow, I thought he was the Indian ambassador! He turned out to be a governor from South Louisiana! If the Indians harm our interest in any way.. ...do I have your permission to terminate? Reed! You can't be going after Indians too! Who's left? I realized that sir, but I have to stop the truth from coming out. No buts, Reed! We don't interfere in foreign countries. Unless if we are going to invade them. Are we going to invade turkey? - No sir! Then leave me alone. I'll go to practice saying Manmo.. han Singh. Before I get to Delhi! Why didn't you die instead of coming in front of me? Respect me, sir. I will give you respect. I had told you, this is gorilla war. Not a dog race. I will get the three of them. No! So what if they beat up 30 people? I will make entire Istanbul go after them. I want my interview splashed on every T.V channel.. ...every newspaper and every radio channel. Rizwan! - Yes! We have become world famous! That's us! Not just on Al Zohra, but on the entire media.. ...an attack on the freedom of the press. They have murdered my security chief Zahir.. - Chips! And 15 guards too! Every person working at Al Zohra is a part of my family. And I will get justice for my brothers! Our security camera's have taken the picture.. ...of these three terrorists. That's us! We look good man, see. I request the citizens of lstanbul.. ...to help us catch these terrorists! Anyone who gives us information about these terrorists.. ...will be given a reward of one million dollars. One million dollars. What, just one million dollars! I'm going to take a bath! The entire world is after us, and you want to take a bath. So, I'll just be back. And yes, Vikas, don't make a call. I'll see you in a bit. Vikas! - Cheers!
