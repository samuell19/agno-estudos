We're at the bottom of the quarter, Cleveland High is down 3 points with 10 seconds left on the clock. It doesn't look like Cleveland will be bringing home the win today, folks. Wait a second! The ball's in the air... Tyler Dell with the touchdown catch! And Cleveland steals a miraculous last second victory! ♪ Alternative rock music ♪ Dreams, they don't change a thing ♪ Cheese! Oh my gosh, so cute! Coach Paula? Leah, what is it? What's wrong? There's something I have to talk to you about privately. - Right now? - Yeah. Attack! You guys did great! Really great, I'm proud of you. Great game today, Tyler. Thanks. You're going pro, no doubt about it. Don't be so thirsty, Leah. I just want my scholarship, that's it. This is all just a way to scam a college education. You should come out to the party with us tonight. Maybe later. I'm gonna celebrate with my girl right now so, I'll see you guys! Hey you! I got the perfect picture of you! You should see all the really cool drone shots that Mikey got of you. Nice! Sometimes, everything works out perfectly. By the way, good game man. Yeah, so how about we get outta here together? Mom wants to buy you dinner. What your mom wants to do is keep an eye on us. Or me, really. Can you blame her? Leave us alone together and we can't be trusted. Touche. Hey, Mikey, get a shot of us? Sure, all right. Might as well. All right, ready? Aaaand break! Hi, mom. Hey. That's enough of that, let's go get some pizza. Yeah. Let's do it. I'll see you at the park later, Mikey. I'm going to kill her. I mean, look at that catch! I can't tell if you're admiring me or the photos. Both! Little bit of both? Yeah. Seriously, some of these are really awesome... That one looks so good. You did a great job. Well, congratulations on the win, Tyler. I think the team's discipline has been good for you, right? I hear that your grades are coming up. Yeah, it's been a good year. I feel like if I put my mind to it, I can achieve anything. I think that you do your best work when the whole community is watching. Honestly, I thought you disapproved of me, Coach White, but I'm glad you don't. No, I do. I do disapprove of you. Mom! What? I'm joking! All I'm saying is that the Captain of the Football Team and the Head Cheerleader are supposed to be together. It's like a law of nature. Okay Mikey, I get that you're into in Leah, but Tyler, my boyfriend, is not. But that's exactly what I'm saying! Their personalities don't matter. They don't have to like each other, it's like an instinctive mating ritual. They have a role to play, it's an unwritten rule. Like a king doesn't go for a peasant, he goes for a queen. No offense, Mikey, but you're not exactly an expert on relationships or romance or sex or anything! How dare you, okay? Miss "Captain of the Football Team" doubts my authority on love? You know, sometimes things are a lot clearer from an outside perspective. That's all I'm saying. you always try to make Tyler sound like he's some dumb jock stereotype. Let me guess: he's really thoughtful and really sweet? He is! Yeah, I'm sure he is. And number two: Leah is a total jerk, and she's in love with herself. Okay, we should be recording now. Let's see... Drone me! Thank you. All right, you ready? Yeah... let's do it. Here we go! Whoa, yeah all right! Jeez, this is pretty cool... I bet I could see right into people's houses. Okay no, we're not doing that. You know, I heard she's having a party today. Who? Leah and the cheer squad. Oh, that's literally like the last place I'd ever want to be. Didn't you used to be best friends with her? Yeah, like a million years ago when we were little kids. So what happened? I guess she wanted cooler friends. So you guys just never talked or anything? That's kind of lame. Hey, there it is. There's the party! How would you like it if people spied on your parties? I don't have parties, so... Just fly on home. No, I still more time on my turn. Whoa, hello ladies! Eww! I'm not gonna stand here while you literally gawk at cheerleaders. Okay time's up, come on! Goggle me! Thank you. Wait, is that Tyler? What do you see? Give me the controls. What, what's going on? I can't believe it. Sophie, what did you see? Today never happened, okay? Sophie, whatever's going on right now, you know you can talk to me about it, right? It's nothing! It kinda seems like it's something. Sorry, I just forgot that I'm late. I have to go to the flower shop before my mom kills me. Bye. Sophie, come on! Here go you, happy anniversary! Thank you. See you next time! Okay! That's really beautiful. Thank you. Nice work. Anyway, the girls' dedication is pretty incredible, I think all we have to do is tweak a couple of the new routines, and we'll really stand out at the state tournament and maybe even bring home a couple of new trophies this year. I just love hearing about that cheer squad. You know, it never really bothered me that you didn't want to be a cheerleader. It's totally fine, I get it. It's not everybody's thing but, sometimes honey, I think you're just against the idea of being cheerful. No, I'm just sick and tired of hearing about stupid cheers and how amazing it is worshipping football players. It's lame. Okay, maybe you think it's lame. That's fine, but it's not about cheerleading. It's about having a hobby, like cheer squad, or football, or playing the clarinet, or math club, or underwater basket weaving. Like whatever. I just wish that you had a passion for it. I take pictures, remember? Yes and they're beautiful, really. I just think that sometimes you're so isolated and I wish that you were part of a team so that you could learn values like cooperation and leadership. Wait, cheer squad values? Mom, you're making me sick. Well honey, it's not about where you learn them, it's about that you learn them. And teamwork is a good thing. Do you like them better than me? Who? The girls on the cheer squad. No, not at all. Well, why not? Everyone else does. They have more confidence than I do. They smile more, they're prettier than me. No they're not. You spend half your time with them, and when you're with me, all you wanna do is talk about them. You think cheering is like, the greatest thing and mom, you know what, let's be honest. I'm the complete opposite of a cheerleader. Which is amazing, it's wonderful. I love it, really! And you know, I may be the cheer coach, and that's very gratifying for me, but honey I love you more. I love you more than any of those cheerleaders, I love you more than anything on this entire planet. Really! I love you more than ice cream. No I'm serious, I love you more than chocolate chip ice cream. And rocky road? And rocky road, I promise. Okay? Okay. All right. Can I go home now? Mmm-hmm. But does this have anything to do with Tyler? My world doesn't revolve around Tyler, mom! Okay? Okay. I'm going to kill him. Hey Beth. Wait, hold on, hold on. No. Sophie is here with me, it's just the two of us. I haven't seen Leah since the game. Wait, she's missing? Beth called last night. Apparently, Leah is missing. She ran off and got everybody worried. Have you heard anything about her? I'm sure she's okay. She's not okay. They found her. And turning now to some tragic news, police have confirmed the body found last night belongs to Cleveland High head cheerleader Leah Dumont. While details are still emerging, foul play is suspected. Anyone with information is urged to contact local police. I'm so sorry. The police think whoever did this knew her. Someone's going to pay for what they did our Leah. I don't think Reeva likes you. The feeling is mutual. Whatever, she'll be head cheerleader now. That's what she's always wanted. So tragic. How are you holding up? She's upset. Easy there, Mikey. By the way, where were you last night? I could ask you the same thing. Slow down guys. Lets not get ahead of ourselves, okay? No one knows what happened to Leah. True, true. But we'll find out. Hey, c'mon Tyler. We need to get to the gym. I'll talk to you later, okay? So, do you think we need to go check on the kids? Not at the moment. Looks like they're getting it sorted out. Here we go! 5, 6, 7, 8. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8... Hey ladies. Let's all gather in a circle here. This is the first practice without Leah. So if anyone wants to talk about what happened, you know the school has brought in some grief counselors and I hope you know that you can always come talk to me about anything. Let's just hold hands here and let's have a moment. Okay good. Why don't you guys finish your warm ups and I'll be right back, okay? We're gonna have a good day y'all. A good day. Okay, two lanes of three. Let's get going. This was your idea. That's what you gotta do, man, it's what coach wants. You go on ahead, I'll catch up. Hey Ryan. What's up? So all this Leah stuff, it's pretty crazy, right? Yeah it's like, too much to think about. One day someone's here and then suddenly they're gone and the whole world's different. And nobody knows what happened to her at the party, huh? I was at Leah's party. A bunch of guys from the football team were going, it was last minute. I should have told you, but I just wanted to go and hang out and celebrate the game. We're supposed to be completely honest with each other, right? Right, definitely. I kissed Leah. We kissed each other. She kissed me, actually. I'm sorry! I'm really sorry! It was stupid, okay? It was a mistake. We were drinking, and I guess she's always had a crush on me. I'm not gonna make up excuses, I'm sorry, there's no excuse. What happened afterwards? What did you do with her, Tyler? Nothing! For real. When I told her to stop kissing me, she got pissed and she told me to leave, so I left. Me and Ryan left and we just went to run the track by the football field. You can check, all right? When I left, she was buzzed and angry, but she was alive. I don't know what happened to her after that, but me and Ryan were on the other side of town when she was murdered. You might have been the last person to see her alive, Tyler. No! The last person to see her alive is the person who killed her. Okay, you need to go to the police. And tell them what? You need to tell them everything, the whole truth! I don't know anything, okay? I don't know anything! Sophie, think about it! My dad is doing hard time for armed robbery. And I have two arrests for vandalism. I know how hard you worked to put all that behind you, but... The cops won't care! They're just going to find the tiniest reason to pin it on me, and I'm screwed. My Mom will be heartbroken; we can't afford lawyers, or court fees, or any of that bull. If I get involved in this, it could ruin me! You think that's more important than what happened to Leah? No, but one tragedy doesn't fix another tragedy. I'm scared, Sophie. Okay, I'm scared. The only thing I know for sure anymore is that... Is that I love you. I love you. I'm in love with you. From the first moment I saw you, it's like... It's like nothing else even mattered. I love you, too. So much. Look. From now until forever, we have to trust each other, and protect each other, okay? Please! I know how people look at me, okay? Like I'm trash. Like I'm some loser juvenile delinquent. If it weren't for football, or for you, I'd just be some kid who gets detention all the time. And I can't help but think that... What? What if that's the point? What if I'm being set up? What if the killer is framing me? I want you to look me in the eye and swear that you have no idea what happened to Leah. I swear! I didn't hurt her. And I don't know who did. I had nothing to do with it. Okay. Then we have a killer to catch. ♪ Guitar rock music Coach Parker. You're gonna have to start calling me Matt. How are they doing? Well, you know... I just assume that they're even more freaked out than I am, they're just better at acting cool. Tough to be the fearless leader when none of us have any answers. Oh, I forgot to send you the information on the candlelight vigil, it's... Please do. I don't have my phone. I'll be right back. I got a text from Sophie. Great picture of the game, dinner at 6:30, see you soon... Hey girls, has anybody seen my phone? Are you guys finishing up your warm-ups? Sorry, what was it you were looking for? My phone. Has anybody seen my phone? Oh, no. We haven't seen it but we'll keep our eyes peeled. Thanks. Why don't you guys run laps? I found it! ♪ Music playing on headphones ♪ Hey Mikey! Mikey? Hey! Hey. Hey. How's it going? So, you know the other day with the party? You mean the day Leah was murdered? Yeah that one. Yeah. It kind of feels like a dream, doesn't it? Like a really bad nightmare. Well, which one of them did it? What do you mean? Think about it: we got the cheerleaders, the popular kids and the football players, right? Statistically speaking, one of them had to do it. I mean it could be her parents, but the odds that this is just some random killer are almost zero. So I'm asking you: of all our friends that you know, which one do you think would do it? You really think someone we go to school with is capable of murder? We're all capable of murder. So who do you think did it? No, I asked you first. I don't know. I don't know if I really wanna know. I mean, the police will figure it out, right? Only 64% of murders are ever solved. Great. But we have so many pictures of Leah, we can find clues. I know what the drone saw. We saw what happened at the party. Tyler and Leah's kiss. I'm sorry. We need to protect each other and trust each other, right? Yes, definitely. So I'm gonna need you to swear to me that you won't tell anyone about the drone video of the party. Are you being serious? It's just going to make the cops look at the wrong suspects. Tyler is terrified right now... No he is, and you know that this could ruin him. I don't know why you think I should trust Tyler. That guy has never even acknowledged my existence in my entire life. Then don't trust him, trust me. Please trust me? Okay. You swear? Yes, I swear. You're the best! Thank you! You know there's always room for improvement, you can tighten it up, clean it up a little... Hey, Paula? Yeah. Keep going. Hey. You don't look so good. I just got off the phone with Leah's mother. Have they learned anything new? No, nothing yet. She's pretty broken up. She's asking about Leah's cheer uniform and pom-poms. I guess the family's sentimental. It's the little things, right? I totally can get that. Just heartbreaking. Every game I can remember, Leah was there. Do you mind checking Leah's locker? I'm about to run into town, I can drop those things by her parents' house. Sure thing, yeah. Ladies! Continue with your cool down stretches, okay? I'll be right back. Good job. Hello, anybody here? Hello? Coast is clear, come on. Things must be pretty brutal for your girls. Yeah. All I can tell you is I know the boys on the football team are sure feeling the weight of this. They're actually very caring, sensitive kids. I can't imagine what her parents are going through right now. Leah was like a family member. Do you know the combination? No. It's okay, I know a sure fire way to unlock these things. Do you? Yeah. Your days are numbered? I think we need to call the police. Ladies? Hey. You can't disappear on me like that, not after what happened. I just spent the whole afternoon with the police. Apparently somebody was threatening Leah. There's nobody threatening me. Yes, but we don't know where the danger's coming from, so we have to be extra careful. Okay. I just wanted to see some of my friends. I know. I know that this is difficult. You just can't disappear on me. How are your friends holding up? Everybody is just in shock. I don't really know how we can deal with Leah's death as long as the killer's still out there. All I can think of is, well... Tell me. Leah's whole world was about being head cheerleader and those girls have a history of cutting down anything in their way. What are you saying? Wake up, mom! Everyone knows they're vicious. They hate kids like me. They hate teachers who tell them what to do, but most of all, they hate each other. Well, whoever hurt Leah... Killed, mom. She's dead. She's not hurt, or sick, or coming back. She's gone forever. And while it may be scary to think about, whoever did it was probably somebody that we know. Which is why we need to be extra careful. Aren't the police supposed to arrest somebody? Are they the ones who were supposed to figure this out? Yes, but until they do, I don't want you to be alone with anyone. Not Tyler, not Mikey, or anyone. You're grounding me? No unsupervised socializing. You can have people over when I'm here, but not alone, okay? Mom, don't you think right now is exactly when I need my friends the most? No unsupervised socialization, period. Is that understood? Honey, is that understood? Fine, whatever. And stay away from those cheerleaders! ♪ Rock music All right! 5, 6, 7, 8! Yes, that's it! Looking real nice, ladies. Excellent work, excellent. Maybe a little tighter next time? I've gotta go talk to Coach Parker. Are you okay to take the rest of practice? Yeah, of course. Hey, Coach White? Yeah, what is it Reeva? I just want you to know I never wanted it to be like this. I always wanted to be head of cheer squad, but not this way. I know. It's okay, Reeva, it's all right. Leah knew you loved her, right? We all have little regrets. You want to talk more about it more? I just want to cheer. For Leah. All right, get in there. Tighter! Hey coach! My favorite cheerleader. Coach Parker. Ha, so close. One of these days you'll see me as a human and not just some jackass with a whistle. Maybe. They don't seem too devious today. 7, 8, 9, 10! Do you guys even want this? Do you? I don't hear you! What if it really was one of them? Are you kidding? They're a bunch of teenage girls. How much trouble can they really cause? All the trouble. I guess I just didn't see it before. See what? How dangerous they might be. You remember being that age? Why aren't you smiling? Tighter! Is that hard... Cheer squad and the football team can get into some trouble. But the little ways they misbehave, it's a pretty big leap to murder, Paula. All right, well what kind of trouble have you heard? Nothing, really. Hormones, popularity, college pressures. They can be pretty vicious to one other. Vicious? That's the word that Sophie used. Faster, go! You know, if you've heard anything about my girls, you should really tell me. You know them better than I do, Paula. The football team has the same kind of problems. Bullying, hazing, kids acting like spoiled brats. We got rid of all hazing years ago. I was very clear with my girls. They know that there's a standard of conduct to uphold. Sure, and the football team is strictly alcohol-free. But, c'mon, there's only so much we can do. These kids, they create their own little world. So what you're saying is: I shouldn't be worried, but they are up to no good? Isn't that teenagers in a nutshell? Yeah, I guess. 6, 7, 8! Don't put your knees down! You think you can cheer with weak little girl arms? Push ups? You're flat chested and you can't even do a push up? All right, that's enough. You know what? Cheer squad is about blood, sweat, and pain. It hurts now so it doesn't hurt later. You want to be the best? Go change, I'll see you tomorrow. Make sure none of those girls talk about the murder, okay? I don't want to hear about maybe who did it, I don't want to hear about the funeral plans. Keep a code of silence, okay? All right, head in! Hello? You better be careful. Your mommy can't always protect you. Your nose is bleeding. All of us squad sisters know that our fierce passion is what makes us great. But Leah wants to make up lies and complain to the school about our fighting spirit. Do we really want a snitch running our team? Team solidarity is what's most important. So I'm officially saying that we can do better than Leah. It's time for a new head cheerleader. Hey you. What are you doing here? You weren't responding to my texts. Sorry, I've just been caught up with some stuff. It's okay, it's fine. Is something wrong? I'm just really overwhelmed. I know. But that's why we gotta stick together. Keep each other close and safe. Mom grounded me. At least, I can't have you over like this. No unsupervised friend visits. It's like she thinks I'm a child. Do you still think I did it? No! No, I know you didn't. It's just... maybe we should wait for all the drama to die down. I hate that you feel unsafe. Have you talked to the cops? Heard anything about the investigation? Nothing, just... What? Just little clues. Nothing big though. But, if I had to guess: Reeva. She's always wanted to be head cheerleader. Whatever was going on between her and Leah, things were getting pretty toxic. Reeva. Of course. That makes total sense. I bet Ryan knows something about it too. I'll talk to him as friends, see what's up. You should find out what you can about the cheer squad, too. I will. This is gonna work, Sophie. We're gonna get through this and find this killer. Hey, not now Tyler. C'mon, why not? We shouldn't punish ourselves just for being alive. You know, if anything it's our responsibility to savor the time. Every moment with you is special. Tyler, wait. Wait! Text me! Hey, honey. Hey! Can you help with the rest of the groceries? Yeah. Hey. Paula! Good to see you again. Really nice view. I... You know, I've been thinking about our last conversation. About what we owe to these kids. And how you dodged my question. Pardon? I asked if you knew anything about any bad behavior on the cheer squad and I would really appreciate a real answer. I don't really listen to cheerleader gossip. Okay, how about football player gossip? What is it you really want to hear? Coach Parker, I'm trying to do everything I can to take care of the girls on cheer squad and clearly they're keeping secrets from me. What does that have to do with me? Whoever hurt Leah was probably one of her friends at the party. Maybe someone from the football team. Now hold on. Don't you go pointing fingers at my team. I set an example for those boys: study hard, play fair, give respect. We do charity fundraising three times a year, we do a bake... Yeah, but everybody turns their head if there's too much drinking, or partying, or whatever. I mean how much worse does it have to get? There's a zero tolerance policy for any player misbehavior on or off the field. All right, well then how did Tyler get on the team with his vandalism arrests? Tyler has proven himself to be a diligent student and a fine young man. He's made a sincere commitment to improvement. That's a lot more important than a couple of minor infractions. Well I gotta break it to you coach, that does not make a zero tolerance policy. Before this tragedy, this team was undefeated. Paula, it is my job is to keep that streak going. Yes, but... My boys need to stay focused and determined. Frankly, a dead cheerleader isn't great for morale. I need to protect these kids, Paula. Throwing accusations around is just gonna make them feel worse. What secret are you keeping? Are you gonna tell me, or the police? Tyler and Leah, they were seeing each other. Right under Sophie's nose. I'm sorry, I didn't want to be the one to tell you. Who all knew? Ryan and Reeva. A couple of the other football players. They tried to be secretive about it, but some things just can't be kept a secret. Look I'm sorry, I just thought it would hurt less if you didn't know. Well, if you want to be an example for your players, you might want to start with honesty. All right, so what do you got for me? You first. Okay, check this out. So I dug a little deeper into the cheerleaders' social media. And pro tip: don't ever set your password to "password". No... Yeah but anyway, you were right about Reeva. 5, start doing push ups now! 6! 7, 8, don't put your knees down! You think you can cheer with weak little girl arms? Okay that kind of cruelty, that's not normal right? I could never act like that. She's gotta be twisted. I mean she's a bully, that's pretty clear. But normal, twisted? People can be both. There's... there's more, too. So it's definitely Reeva. No, I mean there's more of other stuff. Like what? Look Sophie, I'm sorry to show you this. I don't want to. Just show me. I took that picture. So what? You shot more than you saw. Look. I know this is really harsh. I'm sorry. I think I have tissues. No, I'm not gonna cry over him. Here, I'll attach them all to an email and I'll send it to you. Sophie? Hey, you okay? I'm fine. Why? Mikey's mom just called. And? Mikey has been seriously injured. What? Yeah, he's on the way to the hospital, they think he's gonna be okay. But I just saw him a couple of minutes ago. They think it was a robbery, they don't have any suspects yet, but... But what? Well, it's not hard to think that maybe it has a connection with Leah's murder. Mikey had nothing to do with Leah's death. How could you even think that? Sophie! That's not what I meant... Dammit! Tyler. Hey! Hey. I'm glad you're okay. I mean these days. Did you hear about what happened to Mikey? Yeah, but I'm not here about that. Okay. We need to talk. I know all about your cheating. I'm sorry. I'll keep saying I'm sorry, because I mean it. Stop it. I know it wasn't just a one night thing. I've seen proof. Pictures. Videos. Look at me. Sophie, look at me. I love you. It's over, Tyler. It just hurts too much. Please! I'm sorry okay, I was wrong about everything. And I'll do anything you want. I'll do anything, anything, please just don't... I can't do this anymore! I'm sorry! You did this. Sophie... Sophie! Sophie! You did this! Hey mom. Hello? Mom? Mom? You were gonna stab me with those? Okay, hey. How are you holding up? I broke up with Tyler. I found out he's been cheating on me. Oh honey, that's awful. That's awful, I'm sorry. Listen... You are beautiful and you are talented and you're special and precious, okay? Thanks. How did you even know he was cheating on you? Flying the drone with Mikey. I saw Tyler at Leah's party, kissing her. He tried to deny it at first, but there was too much proof. I have it all on video. Wait, you have video of the party? This whole time? You have actual video of Leah before she was killed? Yeah, but it doesn't show any of that. Just the stupid party. Honey, that's crucial evidence. We have to give that to the police right away. I swore I'd keep it secret. Okay from who, Tyler? No, no, no. You don't need to protect him, especially if he's innocent. There could be clues on that. The police could catch the killer from them. No, but I've already seen it and it doesn't show who did it. It's just Leah hurting me one final time. Okay honey, listen to me. This is bigger than you and Tyler, this is bigger than you and Leah. We've got to get that to the police right now, c'mon. Come on! Okay. Get the memory card, we'll take it straight to the police, okay? Okay. Hurry honey. Mom? Sophie? Hurry! What is it, honey? It's all gone! All the video, the evidence, everything! What has happened? Okay they're still here. Call 911! Hi, I'd like to report a break in... Stay close to me, Sophie. Sophie, no! Reeva. I came here to apologize about the other day. I got defensive: you have every right to ask questions and look for the truth. This tragedy affects the whole community. Right now we just need to... Are you going to hit me with that candleholder? Just come in. Mikey! Hey, how you doing? It's good to see you out of the hospital. It's good to be alive. Let me see? You look horrible. Does it make me look cool? Uh-huh. Hi Ms. Will! Hi Sophie. I have pizza inside, c'mon! I gotta give my mom props for getting me a new computer. This is way better than any of the drugs the doctors could prescribe me. It's not quite as powerful as your old one, but I'm sure you'll transform it into some sort of customized supercomputer. Okay, so the person who attacked you must have been the murderer, right? I honestly don't know. I don't even remember getting attacked, it's just a big black blur in my memory. I think that might have been the point: to steal our memories. They stole all of your video files, the originals and the backups, even your drone. And then they did the exact same thing to me. So it's obviously the murderer covering their tracks, right? And now all of our evidence is gone. Well actually, maybe not. What do you mean? The drone camera makes a recording and it streams that video to my phone so we can control it, and it automatically saves that stream to my account. Wait, you're saying that we might have the drone video? I could be wrong, but... I'm never wrong! Yes! That's just the miracle of cloud storage backup. Awesome! You ready? Skip to the party. Okay... All right, so what are we looking for here? Anything. Anyone acting strange, any sign of why someone would want to hurt Leah. Wait. What are you doing? Stop torturing yourself with this. Does that look like he's kissing her, or that she's kissing him? Does it matter? Yeah, it matters a lot. Okay, it looks like two people kissing that have kissed each other a lot. I never watched this part. Look, everyone was watching her dance. No wonder no one saw Leah go. Wait a second... Wait, you read the news right? About how Leah was killed? Yeah, she was pushed down the stairs and then the killer dumped her body in the ravine behind her house, probably to make it look like an accident. Exactly. Pushed. Holy hell. It's gotta be her. Except she's at a party and has a dozen witnesses around her, that's a pretty solid alibi. There goes her alibi. Okay so she's got means, motive, and opportunity, but... And there's this: the person who robbed my house left it behind. Well I recognize that this. This is Reeva's anklet. So if we find Reeva, and she's not wearing her anklet, that's proof. That's conclusive proof. Maybe. What other possible explanation could there be? Well, it was just lying there right next to my house. I mean it's a perfect clue, Mikey. A big, fat, juicy, perfect clue. Which means either we just solved the case, or someone wants us to think that we have. I don't understand then. I don't either. But I'm not done asking questions. And I don't like the sound of that either. Okay, make a copy of that for me. I think it's time we took this to the police. Yes ma'am. Thank you. So did you invite me here to tell me another piece of red hot secret gossip? I'm all out of secrets. Look, I'm sorry I didn't come clean with you the other day. We need to be working together. The only way we're going to help our kids is by finding the truth. I agree. So the police: any closer to making an arrest? Your guess is as good as mine on that one, I don't know. How's Sophie handling all of this? Who does she think did it? Well I mean, she has some suspicions, but no real evidence yet. I thought we were gonna lay our cards on the table here, Paula. Okay, well what are your thoughts on Reeva? Leah's sidekick, right? The one who's always shouting at all the other cheerleaders. You really think she's the one? I think she's the only real suspect that we haven't eliminated. I see her a lot, hanging out with Ryan. Honestly, she doesn't seem like a killer. She seems scared. I think that there's a real problem with the cheer squad. How so? Well I don't know, exactly. Maybe just mean girl bullying. Maybe more. Before she died, Leah wanted to tell me something in private. And I don't know if it was about Tyler, or Sophie, or the problems on the cheer squad and I guess I'll never know. And I just wish that I had taken a few minutes to hear her out. You can't think like that, Paula. You're a good coach, that's why she came to you. I gotta confess, I'd be relieved if it were Reeva. All I know is my boys need to get back to playing football instead of worrying about a serial killer. Everything okay? Yeah, it's Sophie. Yeah I just have to get back to check on some things. Paula really, let me walk you to the car. No, thank you for everything, really. Wait a second! Hey! Oh my god, you scared me! The detectives called about the break-in. Did they arrest somebody? They wanted a full detailed list of everything that was taken. And? I've got something even better. Yeah? I recognize that. What the hell do you want? The cops already have the evidence. It's over, so you might as well come clean, or kill me. The truth is we all thought you killed Leah. What? You guys hated each other. Her affair with Tyler was the perfect motive, plus nobody knows where you were the night of the murder. Tyler told me how obsessed you are with Leah's popularity. Just burning with jealousy, desperate to make the cheer squad. Are you kidding me? I never even had the slightest desire to become a friggin' cheerleader. Yeah? Then why are you always following us around with your creepy nerd friend? We're the school's official photographers. Oh, so going in the locker room and taking pictures, is that part of your official job description? No, I was just looking for information. You're the bully, Reeva! You're just gonna pretend like you're not? I'm a jerk to everyone I know. And I was horrible to Leah before she died. Is that what you want to hear? You don't understand the hours we used to spend together, how we used to work together as a team. Maybe I do. Get in the car. Come on! So what, some psycho kills Leah and we all tear each other apart? What does that say about us? After what happened with Mikey, I just feel like any of us could be a target. I've never felt more unsafe. Are you kidding? Any of us can be a victim at anytime. A bolt of freaking lightning could come out of the sky and kill us right now. That's not the messed up part. If the killer was someone that Leah knew, then that means the killer was one of us. If one of us can be a murderer, then who's to say that you couldn't crack, or I couldn't crack? What if instead of becoming a better person, I just get worse? Hey! We're talking now, right? We're trying to understand each other, maybe trying to heal this. I put the doll in Leah's locker. It was just a stupid prank. I was trying to mess with her, I knew she would go to your mom and complain and I thought I would make head cheerleader. It's so stupid now. But, also... I've been covering for Ryan. It's like every time I talk to him about the murder, he gets shifty and weird. Like shifty and weird how? I mean, don't get me wrong, I have total faith in him. I love him. But? He's not a murderer! But he might know something. Plus, the last time I had on my anklet, I'm pretty sure I was at Ryan's house. You think he could've planted it? No... God, I hope not. But he could have. Damn, dude, everybody's at each other's throats right now. You know, it's like toxic. Yeah well, that's what they're gonna think as long as there's a murderer on the loose. Dude, no! I need you! I can't, just be quiet. Do you know how big this is? If I don't get, I'll be screwed! Come on! Hold up, I think I heard something. Go check it out, go go! Somebody's here! Who's there? Hey whoever you are, you're tresspassing! I don't see anyone man, I think they're long gone. I don't feel safe in my own home. Dude, someone's screwing with us. Relax man, if it was cops they would've just arrested you. Is that supposed to be funny? Chill okay? Chill. Let's be smart about this: there's only one street to get to your house, which means there's only one street to get out. Come on. Mom I'm fine, I just decided to walk home to clear my head. I'll be home in a few minutes, okay? Come on man, where's your spirit? We should just leave her alone, all right? Messing around like this, it seems like it's making everything worse. No, we're too far in now. We've gotta see this through. Hey mom, sorry I'm late. You were supposed to come directly home. So? So, can't you understand how dangerous it is? I'm trying to protect you. No, you're trying to keep me hidden! Hidden and locked up isn't the same as safe! Sophie... No mom, I'm actually out there, I'm trying to find answers. Trying to figure out what's going on. No, you're not. You're grounded. As if that makes any sense! You haven't given me the bare minimum of effort! And I have given you plenty of warning... Give me your cell phone. No! Do it. If we do nothing, this is never going to end. And if you keep stirring up trouble that you don't understand, this is gonna get much worse. What does it mean? Hey, your battery's getting low. What do you wanna do? I'm figuring that out, okay? Gotta see what she knows. Let's just go, let's just get out of here. It's not like you can do anything until her mom is gone. That lady hates you. No, no she doesn't. It's just misplaced emotion, you know, basic psychology. If Paula was Sophie's age, she'd be super into me too, y'know? But she's a little older, so she's jealous of her daughter, and she acts like she hates me to hide her attraction. What the hell are you talking about? Look, I'm going to win back my girl. I'm gonna make everything right again just like it was before Leah's death. Death is just a part of life, you know. Everybody will forget about it and move on. Tyler, nobody's gonna forget. I'm gonna talk to Sophie, tell her I love her, and everything will be normal again. Everything will be good again. Hey, Mrs. White. I'm sorry to bother you. Is it okay if I speak to Sophie for a second? I don't think that you should be here. I, I just wanted to tell her that she's right, and I'm sorry. No hard feelings, you know? I know that you're cheater. And I also know that my daughter deserves real love and that you're too selfish to care. Wow, I guess I deserve that. But if that's really how Sophie feels, I should probably hear that from her. I just want to own up to what I did. Mom! Let him in, we have to talk sometime. Please, I just want to explain things and apologize. I expect nothing more. Thanks. Hey. And keep the door open! All right, let's see who has my drone. No. Sophie just choose us. That's all I'm asking you for. A fresh start. Me and you will grow together and we're stronger together now. I thought you just came to apologize. Please, I just... Just give me a second chance. I can't. I'm not saying it's impossible, it's just that things are really crazy right now. I need some time to myself. Some space to figure this out. Look... I've been really, really patient with you, Sophie. You think you're better than me? What are you talking about? Wow. Looks like honest little Sophie has a few secrets of her own. So how long have you known? You've just been toying with me this whole time? Just go. You should learn to be a little more grateful. Hey, Mikey. Why do we have to keep doing this? You said it was an accident. You're not going to jail just because Leah fell down some stairs. Ryan it was an accident, okay? I didn't mean to do it. She just couldn't keep her mouth shut. She was gonna tell Sophie and screw up my whole life, maybe even cost me my scholarship. I just wanted to have fun and she had to go and piss me off! I didn't mean to push her down the stairs! That's messed up, man. You shouldn't have gone after her or Mikey. I've got an airtight alibi as long as I can trust you. We're still one step ahead of everybody, okay? So just keep your game face on. You have to go. Get out of my house! See, that's exactly what I wanted to do. Sophie's not much fun anymore, anyway. But we got a problem now, don't we? Here, just take the phone and go. You can have all the copies of all the video footage. You really think I'm dumb enough to fall for that? No, no, no. It's going to take a lot more to keep you quiet. No! Sophie! Stop right there! Believe it or not, I actually came here to be nice. That was my plan. Although, if I'm being completely honest right now, I never really have a plan! Life is just so uncertain. Tyler, whatever it is, we can talk it over. We can talk about it and maybe find a solution. Really? Because I tried that with Sophie here and she very wasn't interested in it. Please, just let me go... Shut up! You are just like Leah. She was cool at first too, but then she had to go and mess up everything. I'm not gonna be somebody's second choice. Either you want to see me, or you don't, okay? And I think it's pretty obvious that you love me, so... I don't get what you're so afraid of. It's not like you actually care about Sophie. I'm not afraid of anything. That's it, isn't it? You're afraid. You can't even bear the thought of facing sweet little Sophie... Shut up, okay? Just shut up about it! We're done, I don't date losers! Stop it, stop it! You're gonna end up just like your father, in prison and rotting away for the rest of your life. I am not like him! You want to see selfish? Why don't you look in the mirror? At least I'm not a pathetic loser. I can't wait to tell Sophie about all of this. You're nothing compared to me. You should've been grateful. Tyler! Tyler, you don't have to do this. You don't have to hurt her, this is not gonna be good for you. Jealousy makes people do terrible things, doesn't it? See, when I'm having a problem with a girl, I don't get possessive or jealous. No, I just throw her away. Mom! Oh honey, I love you so much. Tyler listen, you can make the wrong choice or you can make the right choice here and just let her go. I hope you just let her go. Don't worry, I'm going to let her go! No! Please don't! Love makes us do crazy things, doesn't it? We'll do whatever you want. Please! So now we're talking. You know what I want? More than anything else in the whole world? No, what? I want you to... Come on baby, come on! Let's get out of here! You're dead! You guys are really gonna make me hunt you down? Come out, come out, wherever you are. Sophie, Sophie... Leah was too good for you. Honey... honey. Okay, so after I drop you off, I'll have just enough time to go by the greenhouse. They have the most beautiful... Are you expecting someone? No. Hi, Mrs. White. Hey Mikey. I'm sorry for bothering you, but is Sophie home? Yeah. Can I come in? Thank you. Hey. Hey! So I was just wondering, because I got my license now. I was thinking I could give you a ride to school, if... Yeah, it would save my mom the trip, right? Yeah, I mean I'm good with it if you guys are good with it. Very good with it! Let's go. You don't have to worry anymore, mom. Okay. We made it. Yeah. Love you. I love you more! You guys be good. We will! Bye!
