We have to be careful we don't push too hard and break. Looking at the technique, his stride mechanics, ground contact time, how far knee comes up on the drills, stuff like that. As he gets stronger and recovers from workouts, his contact time is less, both as to how hard he hits and also the time that he's on the ground. You know, he's looking better each week, so we have to be patient and not worry it. The worst thing we could do now is push him too hard and he gets injured. The 1990s were a little bit of a lost decade for American distance running, and through 2000, we really were not very strong. I went to the Olympic trials in the year 2000. And we only had one qualifier in the marathon, and he barely made the qualifying standard of 2:12. And this was alarming. Basically, Coach Joe Vigil and Coach Larsen decided we needed to do something. You know, we need to do something about US distance running, and let's form a team. We decided that if we put together a training group up here at Mammoth with the right people that we could have effect on American distance running, because almost all of the medals that are won at World and Olympic Games are with athletes training much of the time at altitude. I followed Coach Vigil and Bob Larsen out to Mammoth Lakes, California, where we put together an incredible group of athletes all living and striving to that same Olympic dream. I've known Bob Larsen for a good 12 years now. We're similar in that we believe that for distance running that it's not just a matter of going out and pounding out the miles. If you try and run harder, you're just going to over stride. There's a lot of other things that are important in a long-term goal and plan for an athlete and building them up over years and years. Good work. 5:06. The fact that Americans could go to altitude and get in the proper training to catch the Africans on the awards podium was a great eye-opener, and it has been a fabulous turn of events to see a resurgence in American distance running. In 1939, my father was born in Minnesota. My dad grew up in a very small, very dark cabin on a farm, which is 50 miles from Fargo, which is probably the most desolate, isolated place on Earth, it seems. No electricity and no running water. I think that humbled him as a person. I think it made him who he was. He went to school with just a few classmates. I think first grade through sixth grade was all in the same exact classroom. He walked to and from school every day. Those stories of walking uphill in the snow both directions, I think it started in Detroit Lakes, Minnesota. Not exactly the weather you'd find a future Hall of Fame coach in, let alone a distance runner. So to come from that to where he is today is quite a journey. My grandfather severely hurt his back. He ended up having to sell the farm, and I believe they flipped a coin. Heads, they go to Los Angeles. Tails, they go to San Diego. It ended up hitting tails, and they ended up going to San Diego. I ran in an era when we didn't know that much about the process, how to get in good shape. So we were really inquisitive even when I was very young. I had a good high school coach, Raleigh Holt at Hoover High School, and I was pretty good all-round athlete, but when I found out there were guys actually running a distance, I said, well, nobody can beat me. I grew up on a farm. City slickers can't stay with me. And that's the way I ran the first few races. The only thing I knew about was you're supposed to pass out, because that what the first sub-4:00 miler, Roger Bannister, did. He would collapse at the finish line, and people would carry him off. So I thought that's what you're supposed to do. So any point in a race, if somebody came up and started challenging me, I thought, oh, this is great, I'll be able to run so hard, I'll pass out at the finish. That's a good mindset. But that's how dumb we were in that we didn't know much about what we were doing. But we were beating everybody. He likes to talk about that he was a runner, but he'll never, ever give anybody times or details or specifics, because, one, I think he's humble, and, two, he always says, well, it used to be a different era back then. More than anything, Raleigh Holt, my high school coach, talked me into being a coach. I don't know what he saw in me. I was clueless like a lot of guys that age. But he saw something. And I watched what other people had done. And I was always inquisitive. I was going to a lot of clinics. But most the things we did, I developed as a runner myself. At San Diego State, I graduated in four years. Fifth year, they wanted me to stay around and be the coach of the distance runners and track, which I did. And so I was a graduate assistant. So all those experiences I think really helped me. And then getting the right guy. They offered me the job to continue at San Diego State full time, but I really wanted to coach in high school. I wanted to coach at each level. And Monte Vista had only won one meet each year for two years in track and cross country. And it was a pretty new school, so they talked me into coming out there. And it turned out great. Luckily enough, I got to run for Coach Larsen. I'll never forget. When I first came to Monte Vista, I was five foot two, 102 pounds. After just two months of running with him, I was varsity material. You know, when I started it was all about toughness, more than anything else. But I know it was a big part of what I was selling when I went into high school. I would run with the guys. I'd use myself kind of as an example, and that helps a lot. I mean, that gives you instant credibility. When you have your coach that runs with you, you don't want to lose to him. When you saw me, my face would turn red and slobber coming out of my mouth. Even if I didn't say anything, and I was running that hard, nobody wanted to lose to the coach. So my goal was on every distance run that we went, stay with the coach, stay with the coach. What we were doing was a lot of race training. Now we call it threshold training. That was maybe the key single thing that put us in front of everybody else, because we were doing it on a regular basis. I had guys that could make things happen. And they weren't so good that it was automatic, but once I got them going, they were tough enough that what I was giving them as workouts would produce results. Our big thing here at Monte Vista was we didn't know the word lose. Losing wasn't in our vocabulary. We never lost a race. They would run as hard as I did when I was in high school, where we'd have to literally sometimes carry them off the finish line. And over the years, so many guys did that, and why they did it, I have no idea. But I'm so grateful to them, because even if they weren't great talents-- and not all those guys were great talents-- they made up for the difference, because they were just as tough as nails. It's not just the coaching, you know. Put his arm around you. Just say little positive things that just you would absorb and make you that much better. Didn't matter if you are the first man, the 10th man, or the last man, you were very, very important. This is a family. You stick with me, you are going to be very, very successful. Whatever he said, we did. He changed our lives. He changed my life totally. Confidence. Self-esteem. Believing in myself. I think instinctively I had something there, and Coach activated it. He put kerosene on the fire. I figured I was going to stay about four years, and I stayed exactly four years, and we were able to turn around the program immediately. Back in the day, they'd all be small. Yeah, exactly. Small or medium. People must have thought we were weird. Remember that uniform? Long-haired guy in stripped pants. I mean, come on. Look at that finish. Holy cow. All right, guys, we need a quick picture. Let's line up where these chairs are, right here. Keep your hand on your wallet, man. That isn't my wallet. OK. One, two, three. Perfect. Time for your speech. In 1967, Ron Vavra offered me the position coaching with him and Jack at Grossmont Community College. I respected both of them greatly and decided to take that job. It was difficult leaving Monte Vista. I had so much fun with those guys. But at each stop along the way in my career, I could say the same thing. I just hated to move. Let's go back just briefly in history. I don't want to make this too long. But at Monte Vista, we'd would run with that group, and then I went up to Grossmont College. Ron Vavra over here convinced me to come up there. I had some really good offers to four-year schools that were legit. I can't spell. I can't type. I can't work a computer. But I can coach athletes, and I can read people. And I knew that Bob Larsen was the best. He knew all the right buttons to push, psychologically, physically, and emotionally. I mean, I could have gone to lots of different universities. But everybody kept saying, Coach Larsen's the best. You need to go to Grossmont. Coach Larsen's the best. You need to go to Grossmont. And I'm glad I listened to that, because I would never have the experiences that I had. And I don't think I would have excelled as well. The way we trained was unique. We were cutting-edge with our training. We didn't realize at the time. Bob realized it, but we didn't. The way he coached was that each athlete is unique and that whatever their needs or their training needs to be designed for them. And each athlete improved. It's almost like magical the way he can bring out the best in every one of us, not just me. Not just someone who makes the Olympic team, but everyone on his team, he just seems to be able to get us to our best. Coach Larsen made it fun for us. There wasn't a part of it that made us feel, you know, I don't want to run any more because it hurts too much. And we were able to in our hearts really enjoy the run. One of the main reasons that threshold training or tempo runs became important in my program was I experimented with them towards the end of my college career. I had been injured in high school and in college doing lots of interval training and pretty much exclusively interval training. But when I started doing the longer distances on the roads, on trails, or especially at the beach on the soft sand, I found that my strength improved very rapidly, and I still retained quite a bit of speed on the track with very little interval training. Threshold training, which when we were doing it, I had no idea it was threshold training. Running very hard and maintaining that throughout. And then what would naturally happen in these things is that we'd have some surges going on. There would be a hill, and it's just a natural thing, who's going to be first at the top of that hill. We were all very, very competitive, and we would go out on road runs, and we just didn't want to lose. So, you know, you think about threshold training as not racing, but there is a point where we were racing. I can recall one road run where we were running back to Grossmont College, and we were in full stride racing back, and there was a wallet on the ground. And there could have been $1,000 in that wallet. Nobody broke stride to even check or pick it up, because we didn't want to slow down. But the idea of it then is to be able to run hard and not stop, just continue. And it's a simple principle. It's just run hard. But what that created was a way to race and a mindset and a focus that you can't get any other way. I know that that type of training, I carry it with me today, knowing that that's the only-- the best and only way to get truly fit. So both for myself and those people I started working with, it was easier to peak them for the big races and keep them injury-free by relying more on threshold training as the intense part of the workouts on a weekly basis. And that's where the cutting edge was. Bob knew what we were doing. He orchestrated it all. We didn't realize it, but that's what we were doing. We're at a road called Benton Crossing. We call it Green Church Road, where we many times do our threshold run. Fairly hard pace. Meb's going to go 10 miles or more this morning. Dirk is going to be on his bike, pacing him. And I'm going to be following for support and look forward to a good workout this morning. Dirk, you ready? Threshold run is close to all out. You know, where you're trying to cover the distance at a very, very high effort. It all depends on what kind of shape you're in. It's going to hurt a lot more if you are out of shape, and especially at altitude. We know what the numbers mean when we've hit certain splits. At 5:17, 41:14. When those are starting to come into range where he feels like he's pretty fit, then that gives him confidence, regardless of who else is in the race, that he's going to have a good race. Training threshold pace is all about concentration. You're on the watch basically. You concentrating on mile splits. You know, you're concentrating on form. But at the same time, you're concentrating, I don't want to let that bike go. 5:05, Coach. Thanks. It's a beautiful thing when it all comes together, but at the same time, you're just grinding as hard as you can, just because imagining that you're training for this race that is coming up, and you know, you're visualizing other competitors in that race, and saying, you know what, I don't to let them go. I don't want to let them go. And keep digging. Well, that was a tough one. You don't get him breathing that hard very often. I soon discovered when Ron Vavra talked me into going to Grossmont College to work with him how effective a coach he was, and just what a wonderful man he is. And I learn a great deal from him. He has many athletes who come back and are happy to see him and get a little bit more of the Vavra wisdom, which he has generously supplied to all of us over the years. Life is hard by the yard but a cinch by the inch. It's not only something I live by, it's something I coach by. Every day when Coach Larsen and I were coaching together was Armageddon, but we never skipped steps. We took one step at a time, and it worked. Bob used to say that running is 80 % mental, 20 % physical. And I believe that 100 %. And he teaches the 80 % mental. The physical you bring yourself. He gave me advice. He-- not just me, but others. He would invite me into his office, and he'd say, so, you know, what about this race coming up? OK, so you're in the state meet, what are you going to do? So what if that doesn't work? What are you going to do? So what if that doesn't work? What are you going to do? Kirk, you need to make sure that you have plan A, plan B, plan C. He wants you to think it out. When he would train us, he would train us to focus. And so we would focus on just a few things going into a race. And Bob would call it a business-like attitude. We would have a business-like attitude going into a race. We would have our pre-race instructions from Bob. And he would generally tell us that he will be out on the course to give us instructions during the race. He wouldn't necessarily tell us where he would be, because that would change depending on the race. But one thing that was unique about Bob is no matter where I was in the race, his voice would stand out. It wouldn't matter what was going on, we would always hear his voice. And everybody knows who's run under him, he was never a yeller. He was never screaming at you on the course. It was all constructive. He would say, relax your shoulders, or do this or do that, but there was never any uncontrollable screaming. It was always, when you saw him on the course, you appreciated it. You know, you get all the other coaches out there in the race, and they're just screaming their guts, you just got to go. You've just got to go, move now. And Bob Larsen-- Coach Larsen's like, OK, guys. It's time to go. But you'd hear it. You've got to move. And you would hear it. It may be totally just understated. You got to go. I just really didn't care that much. Even though winning was the tradition at Grossmont, he'd always remind us that if you did-- for one reason, we did lose, what do you do? You just take your foot, and you kick it in the ground, and you say, aw, shucks, you know, maybe next time. Every one of those guys out there will tell you that, yeah, he's my encouragement. He's my mentor. He's our teacher. You know, he is our leader, and it doesn't stop after you leave Grossmont College. If I were to sum up running for Grossmont, it would be that it was the pureness of the sport. Running was pure. It was a pure form of sport. Coach Larsen used common sense. He didn't use a lot of fluff. It was no fluff. There were no fluff workouts. It was all purposeful. We train. We rest. We race. And I should add here that Coach Larsen is for me, the guru of distance running. But he also coached the jumps, and the high jumpers he had, 6'10", 6'8", long jumpers over 24 feet. Triple jumpers around 50 feet was amazing. So Coach Larsen could coach anything, even though he was the greatest distance guru of all time. We're at Mammoth Creek and the temperature is probably 52 degrees in the stream here. It's ideal for recovery. You build up fluid in the tissues when you work out really hard. And this controls that. And when you come back the next day, you're going to feel better, and your muscles are going to be more ready for harder work again. We did for three times 2.2 miles today at almost 9,000 feet elevation. So that beats up your body a little bit. So this is very helpful in the recovery process. This hurts, sitting in the stream. Obviously, I'm not sitting in the stream. I've done it before, but it's not an enjoyable experience. Athletes have to really be dedicated to stay on a routine that will keep them fit, avoid injuries, and, obviously, stuff like this is a big part of this. And it's allowed him to continue to run. So all of these things, I think, contribute to that. Oh, wow, I got to get that. Oh, it's like dropping the flag. Jamul Athletic Club-- Yeah! And Claremont Toads. When I was coaching at Monte Vista, I was looking for a way of letting the guys race in some open races during the summer between cross-country and track, but now not get too serious about it. There was a little community that some of the guys lived close to that were at Monte Vista. It was called Jamul. Just a store and a bar and a church. And having been a country boy myself, that was kind of appealing. So-- and it was an interesting name. It means bad water in Indian. So we called it the Jamul Athletic Club, and we continued it when I went to Grossmont College. And it got bigger and bigger and stronger and stronger. And we were winning some major races, and guys were running very fast. Claremont High School graduates put together a club they called the Toads. And there was a rivalry between us. But they were very good. We liked those guys. They asked to join forces with us, and we decided that it would be ideal for both groups. These degenerate guys from Claremont High School who were going nowhere fast wanted to join, you know. I mean, we had all the power, and they wanted to join. And I don't know why we accepted them. I still feel we made a big mistake. But, but, they were the Toads-- apt name for those guys. And so all of a sudden, we're the Jamul Toads. It was an awesome feeling to run with the guys that had been your rivals. I mean, what a great story to bring us all together. I mean, that was very unheard of back in that period, because clubs around the country were recruiting guys, and, I don't know, maybe throwing some money around. But, you know, we were a club that was just local, homegrown talent, so I was always very proud of what we accomplished. One of the directors of the Jamul Toad newsletter. I don't remember being a director. Gary Close was the newsletter person. Do you remember these? Oh, oh. Oh, you know what? I don't have that one. The Jamul Toads back in 1973 were a bunch of long-hair, scraggly-looking guys. All of us had long hair. We were like your typical rock stars back then. I mean, we were a pretty scraggly-looking bunch. I think it was a very unique time in, you know, the running history of San Diego. Because you are, you're talking about a great wealth of talent. I mean, the Thom Hunts, you know, the Kurt Pfeffers, Mendoza, and Lux. Harper Fleet. I mean, you had caliber people. All from the same county. All from the same county called San Diego. We'd go out and we'd hammer 10-, 12-mile runs. We didn't stop for cars. You know? It was like, you'd pound on a car if it was in your way, and you were-- I mean, it was hammer city. And so for me, running with that group of guys was like probably one of the things that I think back that helped me become a strong runner. Very seldom do you get runners-- young runners that want to dedicate-- they want to dedicate what they're doing. They want to be fanatical about it. But in order to get good, in order to get to that level, you have to be fanatical. You know, one of the disappointments for going to school at Grossmont was that it was only two years. So we wanted to be coached by Coach Larsen for four years, you know. So for us, that was kind of what it was. And you still were associated with the team. And you still were associated-- you were a Toad. You were still a Toad. That was-- I was more of a Toad than I was a University of Colorado Buffalo. At that time, I had left Grossmont College and moved on to Tucson to run at the University of Arizona, and I really loved coming back to San Diego to see my friends in competition. And it was like every time I came back, it was like a reunion. It was like a homecoming. And then when I found out that we were going to run as a team, it was so exciting to come and run together every time we had the chance. And for the next two years, we all gathered together and took on, you know, every team in the United States. The biggest race of the year 1976 was going to be the AAU National Cross Country Championships in Philadelphia. It, in those days, probably was of more interest than even the NCAA Collegiate Championships. And so it was kind of the crown jewel of cross-country running. The National Championships, obviously, it was always a big race, because it's the best in the US competing. And the teams that traditionally ran in that race were pretty high-profile teams. The Florida Track Club with Frank Shorter. The Colorado Track Club. The Boston Athletic Club. Clubs with a lot of sponsorship and a lot of money would run these races. They would all have professional-sounding names. They had professional-sounding runners. But the one thing that was different about those clubs is they were clubs of people that weren't really from the same area. They were clubs of people that could have lived all over the US, but they would just join under this one banner. We were all from San Diego. We all lived within 20 miles of each other. We are all trained with one coach. And that was unique. I was living in Boulder at the time. Coach Larsen called me up and said, I'd like you to come and be part of the team, in which I felt like an honor to do that. And the thing about it was is that for me, I was living in Boulder, and who was our competition? Colorado Track Club. They really wanted me to run for them. You know. And I said, no, I'm a San Diego athlete. We're going to do the Jamul Toad thing, and we're going to beat you. We felt we had a really good team, but we couldn't get a major sponsor. We had one minor sponsor, but most of the funds had to be raised or out-of-pocket. We had some difficulty in flights, getting everybody back there. Weather issues. I was the lucky one. I had no problems flying from Tucson through Phoenix to Philadelphia. But hear the story from the other guys, what happened to them. It took us 24 hours to get to Philadelphia. They were sleeping in airports, and they were driving to Los Angeles. It was foggy, and all kinds of problems for them. So they were tired. And this was on a Wednesday night, which is a critical night of sleep before a national championship. So when we got back to Philadelphia, guys are really tired from the trip. And we had minimum time to recover and get ready for the race. And we were jammed into a couple of rooms. The day of the race, we were leaving from our hotel, and it was a little bit chaotic, because it was race day. We only had enough money for one car. You know, everything was done on a shoestring. You could put three in the front and four in the back. But you can't put four in the front and four in the back or three in the front and five in the back. So Glenn Best, our eighth man, we put in the trunk, and drove to the race with our eighth man in the trunk. It was a big car, and the trunk was very roomy and comfortable, and the drive wasn't that long. So, yeah, that's how I ended up in the trunk. And I'll never forget pulling up to this national championship in one car. And seven of us climb out of this car, and we open up the trunk, and there's our eighth man. I just remember before the race, when we were all warming up, and you know, there's so many people that you know from other clubs who are running. And I remember seeing people from Club Northwest, and they go, oh, who you running for? And I'd say, oh, I'm running for the Jamul Toads. And it was like, who? And, you know, you see people from the Florida Track Club, and who you running for? Oh, Jamul Toads. And they're like, who? You know? And so there's this kind of like, you know, what are you doing that for? Who is that? So there wasn't a whole lot of respect for us. Nobody knew who we were. Nobody had any idea what we could do. But if you took the time to do the homework to look at our credentials, I think it would have scared the pants off anybody, because we had some pretty strong credentials. There was something going on in the air. I had never felt better before a race. I remember doing my strides just feeling so comfortable and so good. I think it was a perfect storm, actually, coming together. And I remember, I slipped as the gun went off. I'm standing behind Tom Lux. And Tom, he starts way-- likes to start in a really low position, like he's almost in blocks. And I was going face down into the muddy area, and Dale Fleet was like a god. He just picked me up and threw me. So my major contribution to that race was the fact that I was behind him, and I saw him starting to go down, and just before he hit the ground, I grabbed his jersey and yanked him up and pushed him. Saved me from falling down and gave me a nice little boost. I remember the day before, we were running through the course and about a quarter mile to 600 meters out, Coach Bob says, there's a pole right here in the middle of this trail. We've got to be aware of that pole. And everyone goes, yeah, coach, you got to be aware of that pole. I went right to that pole and smacked into it. So boom. You know. I was like, bam. I'm like, oh god, so I got around the pole, and from that point on, nothing went well. But I do remember, I had nothing. I mean it was like I was up there for very long. I went right out. I was done early. I had nothing. And really the way it's set up, I think, I was being counted on to win this thing. I mean, not me personally, but I mean as one of the five scoring people to do it. I remember I was in good position at a mile. I think my mile was 4:30. And I remember going by the two-mile mark, and I passed Thom Hunt, which he was supposed be one of our top guys, and I thought, oh, that's not good. When I, you know, basically, laid an egg, Tom Lux took the step forward and ran to a level that no one expected, that no one was necessarily counting on. And I think that's what, you know, made all that whole difference in the world. Terry Hotton, especially, was running very aggressively and was up there on the lead. And his contribution was immense, because I think the other guys felt, if Terry can do it, we can do it too. The race itself, I'll never forget. After 500 meters, the 300 people that were in the starting line didn't exist anymore. They were all behind us. And I was our fourth man. And as this race developed, it was very calm. It was, it was, it was almost surreal, because here we are running a national championship, and it was like I was out for one of our threshold runs with our buddies. And I do remember at one point-- and I think it's one of the only times I've ever seen Bob Larsen get excited. It was about halfway through the race, and we came out of the clearing for a very short time. And we were running like in a little loop area, and Bob saw that we had four guys in the top 10. And he started yelling. And he normally never yells. He started yelling at us in excitement, look around, telling us where everybody was, so we realized what was happening. We were blowing the field away. So I got down to the other end of the course where you come out of the woods. It was the only place you could really catch people to go in and come out of this open area, back in the woods and then on to the finish line. And so here comes Terry, running really well. And here comes Kirk running really well. Here comes Tom and Dave. Where's Ed? Where's Ed? Where's Ed? Does anybody see Ed? No Ed. OK. And our two guys are going back into the woods again right over here, and all of a sudden, over here, I see Ed, finally, and I yell, look, you've got to move up. We got it. Ed moves from 500th to eighth, and we win the dang thing. The elation to win that meet was just beyond expectations, beyond our dreams. Later on that night I remember sitting at a bar with the guys and Bob, and, again, I saw Bob get excited. He just stopped for a moment. He goes, we're national champions. The neatest thing was going back in the hotel. And the guys from the Colorado Track Club are calling home, and somebody called the Jamul Toads just beat us, and they're trying to explain how the heck that happened. You didn't have fly home with them either. They were so angry at me. You know. And I had to fly back with them to Colorado, you know. And they were just angry. You could just see it in their faces. And there was like, you know, how could you do this to us sort of speak. And I think they just assumed that they were going to win the race. As Coach Bob would say, it doesn't matter your time, and it doesn't matter who you beat that should have beaten you. On that day, you were the best, and no one can ever take that away from you. And that is something that has carried with me for, you know, my whole life. Because when you do something in a positive way, it can never change. It can never be erased. You can imagine how irritated it was for people to lose to these guys. I mean, talk about rubbing it in. If you lose to these guys, your life sucks. In late 1970s, I was kind of looking to make a move back to coaching at a four-year college. The way I ended up at UCLA was Jim Bush, who was the head coach and had a lot of success there, called and wanted me to be his assistant with all the distance events, plus the four jumping events. And it was a great opportunity, and I decided to take the job. I think he had a thirst to become the best he could. To be offered a coaching position at UCLA, that's a storied track and field tradition that I don't think my dad could pass up. So when Bob came in, he was given the pole vault and the high jump. And Bob did a great job making that transition. I never over coached any event. I look for two or three key things that you could watch for and correct and concentrate on those, because that was the key to that event for me. And by making it that simple with great athletes, I think we got the job done. Here's a guy who's got his volume turned down to a low level, but the wisdom that the guy had was pretty vast. I think the greatest athletes really learn from someone like that. They give you a little bit more ability to do things on your own. So he kind of stood back and he watched us and he gave simple pointers that we could improve on, and we just had a great relationship. You can't absorb a lot of material when you're competing. Your blood is in your heart and your legs, not in your head. So you got to keep it short, concise. Everybody's yelling. So if I say it softly, and I say it strong enough so they can hear it, it's going to stick. Of course everybody wants to hear their coach. Right? You want to hear, tell me to do something. Am I doing this right? Is it-- you know, cheer for me. Let me know that you're happy with what I'm doing. And I remember he would just say, good job, Beth. Or go. Or get up on that person's side. I mean, it was always like one or two words. It was never, OK, now I want you to go do this. It was just a distinct go. I knew that what I was saying had quite a bit of impact. And that it didn't have to be shouted. It didn't have to come with emotion. It was appealing to their analytical side. Bob's style was intellectual and very cool and calm and very confident, which made me confident. And I think it made the other athletes very confident. But it is like-- a little bit like playing chess. You've got to hold your emotions down a little bit so you can think clearly. It's being analytical, making good decisions, because you're relaxed enough to let your brain operate in key, tight situations. So he didn't do a lot of preparation the day of. It would always be prior to the race. And for me that's good, because I like to sleep on it and think on it and know what I'm going to do and have a plan. And he would go through the whole plan. And he would talk about what would happen. And day of, he would just say, go. One of the things that really comes to mind for me, and it's just for me is exactly what Bob was about. It was the District 8 meet, the Pac-10 Championships. It was my senior year. So we show up at Stanford the day before. And, you know, Coach wants us to go out and run the course. I mean it was pouring rain. I mean, it wasn't just a drizzle. I mean, it was pouring rain. It was windy. It was cold. It was horrible conditions out there. But we're out there running, you know, the course. I wanted to take a look at the course and have the guys look at it, too, because you can take advantage of some of those things if you can do a little bit better than anybody else. It was an unusual circumstance, and I was fortunate I saw that this could be a coachable moment, and it turned out to be just that. And he comes up to a big grassy hill, and he says, OK, now I want everybody to like run, and I want you to slide on this hill, because he says, tomorrow, the course is going to be wet, you're probably going to slip. So let's just let's just practice slipping. You know. So it's like, for god's sakes, you know? Yes, I was aware that there was-- I was not the popular guy-- the popular coach, but you know, going into a championship, I'm pretty driven. We get up the next morning, and it's raining, but it's I mean, it's like a tenth of what it was the day before. So we're kind of walking around the hotel, and you can hear another team's talk, and everybody's complaining about the weather. You know, it's raining, and it's wet, and it's cold. And we're all looking at each other going, it's awesome out right now. You know what I mean? Compared to yesterday what we just did? It was great. I hit that hill that we practiced sliding on during the race, and I actually slipped and fell, and, you know, it's kind of like, there's lots going through your head, but at the same time I'm thinking, we practiced this yesterday. And the first thing that dawned on me was that I was actually sliding faster than guys were running. So I just picked my feet up. I passed three guys, jumped up, and kept going. So all that stuff from the day before somehow came back and helped all of us. We weren't favored to win that race that day, but by a point or two, we beat Arizona. It felt good. It just felt really good. I always thought I have to get the best for each individual. And if you do the best for each individual, then you're going to have a great team. But the individual came first. He also worked on strengthening your mind. Not to doubt yourself in being able to accomplish something. So when you come out here to race, it's like, you know, the sky's the limit. After a while, I stopped kind of believing what I was thinking, and I just believed what he was telling me. And when I followed that, that was by far when I was the most successful. You know, he wanted me to really focus on the steeplechase. And I wanted to be a 1500-meter runner. And I kind of, OK, I'll run it. No, I think you can do well in this event. You know, this is a great event. OK. Nobody wants to run the steeple. OK. I'll do it. And, you know what? He was right. I mean, I don't have a meet record in any other event but that steeplechase. And had it not been for Coach Larsen and his infinite wisdom, saying, Jimmy, you need to run the steeplechase, you know, I may not have that UCLA-USC dual meet record. I never asked them to do something I didn't feel they were fully capable of doing, even in a race. And they knew that, and I'd tell them before. I'd say, I'm not going to ask you to do anything I'm not seeing in that race. You see their back. Everybody looks strong from the back. But I see their face. And if I think they're going as hard as they possibly could and maybe they can't keep it up, then I'm going to tell you. BETH BARTHOLOMEW - He just knew how to say this is what you need. And when he would say it, you would believe him-- or I would believe him. I know he could bring out the best in you. And he probably figured that out. We weren't aware of it. But he was probably aware of what he had to do to get the best out of us. I think for me, the key to Bob Larsen during my years there was the amount of ownership that he gave he gave me to my own running. I think there are a lot of other coaches that micromanage everything that he does so they can be the guy that can thump their chest and say, I made that athlete. That's definitely not Bob Larsen. They never give it to the fifth place coach. They give it to the first place coach. I was so shocked I didn't even know what to say. For Bob, kind of his famous thing is this arm movement when he says you're done. It's just-- if you were doing a work out and not doing so good, it's just, you're done. You're done. And if you got the double you're done, you were done. You were toast. Hey, Beth. A hand across. I mean every-- I'm sure every person will say the same stuff. How are you doing, Dan? He's just got his thing. Well, it was-- it was the coolest gesture. And I use it today. I mean, whenever I see him, I have to take the hand, and I just go like that. There's nothing more to it. And that's what I look at Bob, and I go, he is even keel, and everything's going to be OK. So he would have a soda can. Usually Hansen's or whatever, right? And he would take it for the last drop. You know, get every little bit of the can. I've never seen a man who can get 13 ounces of Diet Coke out of a 12-ounce can. Have you ever seen that? And he had his same bag that he had from Grossmont days taped up on the handle. And you know, we were like, you make enough money, Bob, can you get a new bag? So he just likes his things. He just is Bob. It doesn't change. He doesn't change, which is what is so cool about Bob. In 1984, I became the head coach at UCLA. A big honor. And I had some definite ideas of things I wanted to do. I wanted more guys coaching individual events. I thought that was the key. And what we had done was to emphasize sprints with our scholarships, those limited scholarships, and the throws. And those guys, especially, were very, very strong on our team. But then we had enough guys that were willing to walk on in the other events, we had to be grateful that these guys were willing to do that to be part of the UCLA crew. The big years were '87, '88, when he had Kevin Young. He had Steve Lewis. He had Danny Everett. So obviously UCLA's a track school, and he had amazing coaches, like John Smith, and Andy Curren, and Art Venegas. And I think Bob was very instrumental in just getting those quality coaches and being involved in that recruiting process to bring in those top-caliber athletes. Going back to the whole recruiting process. I was really close to just making that decision to go to USC. Oh my god, the UCLA coach is calling me! I can run in college? It didn't even occur to me that I could run in college-- I was a 4:30 miler. And at the last minute, I got a call from UCLA, and Coach Bob Larsen, John Smith came to my house in northern California, sat down with me and my mom, and the rest is history. And so Larsen called me and said, well, you know, in this typical monotone, hello. Coach Pat says you've got some potential. You know those are not necessarily the times we're looking for, but we'll let you try out for the team. But he had this kind of you know, calmness about him, you know, he just, I don't know if it was in his voice or his tone, but I just kind of believed him. Oh my god. It was like-- it was almost like that. You're talking to God in a monotone, deep voice. And I still-- I'll never forget that day of talking to him. He believes I can run at UCLA. Just made me feel comfortable. Made my mother feel comfortable that if did go to UCLA that I would been in great hands. And I was. So yeah. So definitely a good decision. The fact that he took a chance on me was something I'll never ever, ever forget. Coaching staff. The culture, I mean that was very key for me. With Coach Bob Larsen, I mean, he was basically like the general, pulling all the strings, putting all the pieces of the puzzle together. Bob did create an environment where we enjoyed our teammates. We enjoyed the sport. He would get out there and run with us. Very slow, but, you know, I still, I still needed that. And it was just a culture that he developed where we all pretty much got along. I mean, I came in as a freshman, and you know, I was embraced. I mean, they didn't look at me as a threat. They looked at me kind of as a piece of the puzzle. And I just gelled right off the bat with all them. Fortunately, I had really great training partners. And that was kind of a big thing for me. So Henry Thomas. Kevin Young. Mike Marsh. Danny Everett. We basically knew how to run with each other. We gauged off each other when we competed. I mean it's kind of like, you know, birds flying in unison. We just hummed around the track. In '87, we don't know yet that we were going to be that good. It just came at the end. And we'd had guys injured, and all of a sudden, everybody was healthy. For the NCAAs I think we were ranked fourth or fifth, and we scored over 80 points, and 18 guys, and I think almost everyone had a PR in the NCAA Championships. It was just a phenomenal team and a phenomenal effort. Well, '87 team was a great team. They actually won the championship that year. 80 or 81 points. The next year, we actually upped it by one. Well, when you think about the members on that team, I think between us, we have about nine Olympic medals, several world records. We were the first mile-relay team to go under three minutes. That four-by-four-- team was the first team to run under three minutes in in the mile relay. A huge accomplishment. They ran 2:59.91. I still remember that time. And it was absolutely phenomenal. That particular team-- the UCLA team in '88-- would have beat most countries in the Olympics that year. So, yeah, I would say it was the best collegiate team in history. Those two teams are often referred to as two of the greatest collegiate teams of all time. UCLA was special, and then we had the special coaches that would draw these kids to UCLA. To this day, I feel like I had so many wonderful things happen during my career at each level, but that was collegiately, you know, how can you do more than that? The UCLA Bruins were absolutely phenomenal at the 1988 Olympics. UCLA track and field in particular played an instrumental role in all the hardware that was brought home to US. It's a testament to UCLA tradition. It's a testament to John Smith. It's a-- I'd like to think, it's a testament to my father. In 1993, I became aware of an athlete that was running very well in San Diego. I always watched the San Diegans because I had spent so much time down there. And his name was Meb Keflezighi. So I got more information from some of the people that were watching him, including Ron Vavra, who was really high on him. Meb grew up in Eritrea during the time in which they were involved in the 30-year war for independence from Ethiopia. What really jumped out at me was how difficult their life had been. Young men were being hunted down and forced to be fighters even at a very young age. And food was scarce. And it was just very, very hard times in Eritrea for this family. I mean growing up in Eritrea, it was a war-torn country, obviously, I was born in the middle of it. You know, you're dealing with war, so your life is always in danger daily. There was also a drought and famine in Eritrea. And that was also a big concern. And a lot of families lost kids, because of malnutrition and all these things. At night, hopefully you'll have a dinner, but that's not always the case. My father was involved in the independence movement, not as a soldier, as a supplier. A result of that role within the independence movement, he was wanted by the Ethiopian army. My dad's option was to stay there. And if he stays there, he is going to prison or killed. Together my parents have to make a big decision to do something. And my dad has to walk 225 miles to Sudan. But that's not the biggest journey that he was scared of. It's like leaving six kids and a wife behind that was even bigger. You know, God worked in mysterious way, and he made it to Sudan. He got two different jobs. And then made his way to Italy. After my father saved money and made connections in order to bring the rest of the family over, we reunited. My dad left when, you know, when I was five years old or so, and then I didn't see him till I was 10-year-old. And so that was in 1986. We made it to Italy-- Milano, Italy. We lived there for about a year and a half, maybe a little-- close to about two years. And then on October 21st, 1987, the family landed in San Diego, California. From Eritrea to Italy, it was all about safety. But from Italy to the United States, I think that journey was more about educational opportunities for the kids. And they got to San Diego, and here's a family without means, and for them to live in a very small house, and there were 10 children, mother, and father, a tough life. But what's overwhelming is instead of having all the kids work during the school year for money that the family dearly needed, they were to come home and they were going to study. They'd clear off the kitchen table, put their books down, and they would all study. And then clear it off, have dinner, put the books down, and study again. That was the routine. I didn't speak English, and my parents and they all they told us, this is a land of opportunity, be sure you maximize it, because we didn't have it. Your uncles didn't have it. Your cousins didn't have it. So don't waste this opportunity. And as anything, they wanted A or B in the classes. We have no idea that running was a sport. But in seventh grade, Coach Dick Lord said you know, to the class, if you run hard, put the effort, you're going to get A or B. But if I see you goof around or mess around, you're going to get D or F. Well, parents wanted A or B, so I just ran as hard as I can. I ran a five-minutes-and-20-second mile. He couldn't believe that I ran 5:20. And he says, you're going to be an Olympian, and I had no idea what the Olympics were. First time I saw Meb, he was at UCLA, at a high school invitational. And I went out and watched him run. And he's already pretty efficient, just natural, covers ground pretty well. I decided to go down there and make a home visit. So I asked Eric Peterson if he wanted to go along, and he said sure. My first year coaching at UCLA was Meb's senior year in high school. And I remember, you know, Meb with the flat-top haircut, and he was obviously, you know, extraordinarily talented. And we went down there. And I was practicing Mebrahtom Keflezighi. Not easy to say. A lot of people were saying it incorrectly. So when I got to the door, I introduced myself to his father. Hello, Mr. Keflezighi. And kind of got a good feeling that maybe not anybody else doing a home visit will get that one right. When Coach Larsen and Eric Peterson came to my house, Coach Larsen was pretty timid-- or not timid, but reserved. You know, Coach Larsen was busy, probably practicing my name, you know. We had a wonderful afternoon and spent quite a bit of time and talked to him at length. Meb blew us away. The thing that's special and unique about Meb is who he is, and his character, and his maturity, and his level of commitment, and all of those-- all of those things showed at a very early age. But when we got home, Eric and I talked about it, and talked to Art Venegas, too, because I didn't want to again load up in my area, which is distance running, so it wasn't a-- this wasn't high on our list of priorities. But thinking about that family, and what they had accomplished, coming from nothing, just you know, I could feel it in my heart. So going on just kind of faith and that this family was special, that's why I gave him the full scholarship. And to this day, I jokingly said, I didn't give a full scholarship to Meb, I gave a full scholarship to the Keflezighi family. UCLA at the time was the best academic and athletic combination, which fit my need, and that's probably why I went. Because I knew I'm going to be a runner, but I didn't know how long I was going to be a runner. But the education from UCLA is getting me a lot more down the road, and that's why I went to UCLA. I just think that they from the very beginning had a very good understanding of each other's personality. And I think they had a tremendous level of trust in each other in terms of Meb was going to let Bob push him, and, you know, Bob was eager to work with and develop an athlete of Meb's talent. You know, first when I came to UCLA, he just asked what I had been doing. So he liked to know the person as an individual and what works for him or her. The best part about Meb in his running style, his stride mechanics, and everything, is he repeats it over and over and over again. He doesn't fall apart. Even when he's getting beat, it's hard to force him out of that cadence and that smoothness, that rhythm that he just probably pretty naturally has. You know, when Meb was there, he was one of those guys that would just have that work ethic and focus, and you'd just see him running. But there was something different about him. He had a rhythm with his stride. He had a rhythm with his focus that was different than most athletes. And I talk about rhythm all the time with athletes is they have it. You know, the Michael Jordans, and you know, the Mike Tullys. They just have rhythm. The other thing he does is he works endlessly on drills. And I would, I think, be right on the mark in saying he's as a distance runner has done more drills than any other distance runner of all time, because he never misses. Meb's pretty flexible, obviously, because he works on this all the time. Meb's gone through this routine ever since he was at UCLA. Probably in high school, too. But it's a complete routine, and it's all business-like, and it's done one after another. You know, some of it goes back to things we were doing in Europe, way back when I first went over there in the '60s and '70s and took coaches over there. Really helpful to see what the Europeans were doing, because they didn't have the guys with as much natural ability as we did in those days. So they were more innovative as coaches than American coaches and were trying to show the Americans what was possible. It's kept him competing at a very high level at an age in which many guys are no longer able to compete. Great team guy. You know, everybody sees the talent and the perseverance and coming back from injuries and all that. But he's a team guy. And I even had to encourage him to run faster in workouts and sometimes leave the guys, because he wanted to help each and every one of them to get better and better. Yeah, you couldn't have a better guy. Meb. He really enjoyed our team, but he was so much better than us that he was by himself. It was, it was fun being Meb's teammate. But I was always on the go, academically. And I would call him, or go by his office and say, hey, coach, I can't make the 3:00 practice because I have academics paper due. Bear in mind that English was not my first language, so I have to work extra, extra hard at UCLA to survive or to make good grades. And he understood that, and he just said, you know what, thanks for coming and telling me. Go ahead and do your paper. I remember going on road trips on the plane, sitting next to Meb, he'd read his book. He'd be circling words. You know, at the end of the thing, he'd go over, and he'd say, what does this word mean, what does this word mean and stuff, you know? It wasn't easy for Meb. English was still, you know, his second language. He had to spend a lot of time working diligently to get the grades he wanted to get. And he still had in his mind, it had to be A's and B's. Oh, I mean, I've been very fortunate to have many accomplishments that, you know, I never thought I would-- I might have imagined at one point, but made them a reality. Been coming to the United States 26 years ago, I just wanted to learn English, plain and simple, and see what I can do. And I had no ambition of sports. Graduating from UCLA is one of my biggest accomplishments that I probably framed that diploma, because that's something that I worked very, very hard to earn it. It's the right elevation. Mammoth Lakes is a little over 7,000 feet. And we can go to higher elevation and lower elevations very quickly. And we've got a lot of relatively level running areas. All these things come together to produce a wonderful atmosphere for training for professional distance runners up here. We're at 9,000 feet. It's called Horseshoe Lake. It's one of the lakes in the lake basin up here above Mammoth Lakes. But this is why the town is named Mammoth Lakes is this lake basin up here. It's pretty flat, and we like to come up to 9,000 feet, where it's a little bit cooler. So you get a little better workout in and the recovery is better, so you can do more work, you know, on succeeding days. Here comes Meb, so we'll get ready, finish off these loops. I just wait for a downhill to catch up. You felt all right once you got warmed up? Yeah. Still hurts. The left? Or just overall? Altitude. The altitude. Towards the end of my career at UCLA, I was thinking ahead, and I wanted to retire while I still had the energy and enthusiasm to do other things. I was looking for ways of putting together a training group that would be effective in helping bring American distance running back to a competitive level internationally, because in 2000, we had really probably a low point of American distance running. Throughout the 1970s, American distance running was doing really well. Frank Shorter had a big role in that when he won the gold medal in 1972, came back in 1976 and won a silver medal. Among that group was obviously Frank Shorter, but also Bill Rodgers, Alberto Salazar, and several others that were as good as anybody in the world. On the female side was when in 1984, during the Olympic marathon in LA, Joanie Benoit Samuelson won the gold medal. There's probably various factors. It's not one or two things, but there was a huge decline in American distance running between, I would say, the mid-1980s to the year 2000. I did a 27-year study on the numbers of marathons that had met the 2:20 standard. In 1980, we had 254 runners that hit 2:20 or under. And from 1980 to 2007, we only had 57 people. So it was an incremental decrease for 27 years. And at the same time that there was a decline in the performances by Americans, there was just increasing amazing performances by East Africans. Kenyans, Ethiopians, maybe Moroccans, and other countries. So then I decided to do the Kenyan study. They had one runner in 1980 that hit 2:20 or under. In 2007, they had 589. And a lot of people felt like the East Africans, the Ethiopians and the Kenyans have some genetic advantages or just multiple reasons for them dominating. And they were so talented in running so well that I think that most Americans and Western Europeans just sort of gave up. And I think the low point was seen in the year 2000 when only one American male and one American female was able to qualify for the Olympic marathon in Sydney. Coach Larsen said, hey, there isn't a good explanation why the Americans aren't running the way they were running 30 years ago. Things should improve, not decline. In the '80s and '70s there was different cities around the country that had these truck clubs and long distance running clubs, and a lot of the best runners from around the country would end up migrating to these different clubs. There was a big training base in Florida, where Frank Shorter was part of that group. There was a huge group of runners together training in Boston. Bill Rodgers was in that group and many other really good runners were part of that group. So I think that throughout the years, the focus in the group training was lost. And then everything kind of became fragmented, and runners were just training by themselves wherever. And what it was going to take was getting Americans, in a small, tightly knit groups training together like they used to in the '80s. In, I guess it was early 2000, I was going to put together a training group again, maybe similar to the Jamul Toads from the 1970s when they won the national cross-country title. And try to create something similar. Of course, we wanted to add altitude training. 95 % of the medals that been won in the Olympic Games and in the World Championships had been won by people that either train at or live at altitude. So it made sense that we should be using altitude as a component of our training. When I graduated from college in 1996, I was looking at what the best runners were doing around the world. Gold medalists, world record holders, and every one of them was living and training at altitude. If you're going to compete against the best, what are the Moroccans, the Ethiopians, the Kenyans, where they train? Altitude. And so it was a no-brainer to me that I needed to find a group training at altitude. I landed in Alamosa, Colorado, under the tutelage of Coach Joe Vigil for four years. I'd lived at altitude. I was coaching at altitude. I had different teams come in for altitude training. So he understood the effects, and he also taught physiology at Adams State for many, many years. My education was in science. And I have three master's degrees, and then I got my doctorate in exercise physiology. And everything I learned was leaning towards the physiology of distance running. And then Joe and I talked about why couldn't we get American distance running back to at least where we were in the '70s and '80s. We discussed that, decided to put together a more formal training group, and train like we did in the past. We decided that the team should be housed at Mammoth Lakes at an altitude of 8,000-- which, incidentally, is the optimal altitude. Between 7,500 and 8,000. 2,400 meters is perfect for hematological changes to occur. Altitude is very effective for a lot of people, because the kidneys produce EPO, and that EPO then produces red blood cell mass. And the more red blood cells you have, the more oxygen you can transport to the muscles. Altitude can keep you humble. We'd train, and it was tough. It was hard. And it makes you feel like you're out of shape. In 2001, we heard that some of the top Americans were going to go for the American record at 10,000 meters up at Stanford at their invitational in early May. We went up to Mammoth. We got three weeks in. We wanted more time, but we only had three. And I had confidence that he was going to take to altitude really well, and I wanted to see what he could really do in an all-out effort after coming down from altitude. And here we go. After three weeks of training, I remember, I didn't think I was in shape. And Coach Larsen and I discussed about it to say, hey, let's give it a shot, because, hey, you've been at altitude. Even at altitude, you're not going to hit the things you hit at sea level. And there's great competition, and why not give it a shot? And we gave it a 110 % shot. 65.2 at 400 meters. Now, ladies and gentlemen, to be on American record pace, you need to average right around 65.6. So they are in fact just a hair under on the first lap. You're there, somebody's telling you. 65, 63, 61, and whatnot. So you play that in your head, and we're keeping at the pace. It was a night in which perfect conditions at Stanford. A lot of people in the stands. A lot of noise. A lot of support. And Scott Davis on the-- as the announcer realized what was happening that Meb was sticking on this pace that would be American record, it got more and more exciting. 3:13.4. 3:13.4. Still converts to a sub-27:00 race. Altitude does work. Your mind says, I'm going all out, all out, but your body says, keep going. And that's the beauty of it. And as the race progressed, he was behind a couple other Americans, gradually, they fell back. He got right on the Kenyans who were in the race and matching them stride for stride. Meb running in fourth position. Six laps to go. 20:36.6 Definitely for sure with 800 meters left, I knew I had it. I just made sure I didn't pull a hamstring. Broke the record by seven seconds, close to seven seconds. Like wow. I always dreamed I would be on the cover of "Track and Field" and that race got me there. But the picture I was not so pleasant, because I was like, so excited, and I actually did it, and I had my mouth really wide open, and thrill of a lifetime. But it's, you know, it was a special moment. For Meb Keflezighi, breaking a 15-year-old record at 10,000 meters. We'll have the official time here for you momentarily. When Meb broke the American record and ran 27:13, it didn't take too much more arm-twisting for people to be convinced. It convinced them that this is something that more people should be trying. And so the two of us started selling the group on this is where we would go for altitude. Obviously, it was a 15-year-old record that was being broken, and everybody knew about Mammoth. And it's like, well, how did that happen? And then the next day is you know, Mammoth. Mammoth, Mammoth. So in 2001, we became a close-knit team, led certainly by Meb and Deena. And with Meb's success, and as others on the team produced wonderful results, it became clear to everybody that it was worth sacrificing being away from friends and family to train hard at Mammoth Lakes. Adios. But one of the greatest benefits I found being in Mammoth Lakes with Meb, Coach Larsen, Coach Vigil and the rest of our team in Running USA, there was the amazing empowerment of being together with like-minded people. It was a training camp atmosphere. We fed off of each other every day. The enthusiasm. If you came to practice sluggish one day, the rest of the team was there to lift you up. So it was a really empowering experience from day one. It was a great place to just be focused. There's not a lot of distractions. You're photogenic. You're handsome. That's true. Thanks for noticing. You're spot on. That's that sharp wit I was telling you about. Coach Joe Vigil and I, when we teamed up, I could sense right away this was going to be special. Our philosophies are very similar, but we're just different enough. The combination, I thought, was ideal that maybe we would say something a little bit differently to an athlete, and they would hear it a little bit differently. I was based scientifically. Bob was always based intuitively. And we got along well. I think Coach Vigil and Coach Larsen are extremely different. And I think that they're so successful because they do have unique ways in motivating and inspiring their athletes. And I've gained a lot from each of them. The natural progression for our training group was first to try to establish an international-level competence. The next step would be, could we do this at the Olympic games? I think Coach Vigil and Bob Larsen tried to put together really specific planning and training as we prepared for the Athens Marathon. We knew we were going to have a hot marathon on our hands, so we overdressed in training, wearing long sleeves in the middle of 80-degree summer days. And we consulted with physiologists on how we can really gain an edge at altitude. I had been to Athens a number of times for the marathon. I knew what course was. I came to Mammoth, and I found a course identical to it. We ran it seven times. Meb and Deena. The only difference was we ran it at 8,000 feet. That was at sea level. You talk about preparation. I'm not sure if it was the course exactly. They're physiologists and coaches and apply so much of what they've learned over the years to what we do. But I feel like they're are also very good psychologists. So the fact that they were putting that into our minds that Athens was that goal on that day was really impactful. About an hour before Deena boarded the bus to go to Marathonas, the race started. I called her up and said, Deena, do you have any last-minute questions? And she says, you know, Coach, I feel fitter and stronger than at any point in my life. Inside I said, great. And she said, I run segments of the course for three days now. It's easier. It's cake compared to Mammoth. And she said, I believe I'm going to medal today. For Deena's race, Joe and Deena had a plan that involved staying off the early pace and not going with the leaders, but staying true to that pace all the way through. And the plan worked to perfection. I started catching girls when I finally got some feedback along the course. Oh, you're in 12th place. Now you're in 10th place. I started counting myself. And as I saw Elfenesh Alemu from Ethiopia up in front of me, I thought, oh my gosh, I'm in fourth place right now. If I pass her, I'm getting a medal. And so I reeled her in and just as I passed her, I got this little excitement inside of me, and someone in very clear English on the side of the road said, way to go, girl. You're now in fourth place. And I thought, oh, no, all that work for fourth place? Like, I have to wait-- I really swear I was counting properly. So I'm going to wait until I get into the stadium. I got into the stadium and the announcer in beautiful Greek voice said my name and something that followed that I had no idea what it was. And then someone in French came on. A woman in French came on and said, Deena Castor and something in French. And, again, I don't French. I said, please god, make this next language be Spanish or English, so I can understand what place I'm in. And the announcer said, Deena Kastor is going to capture the bronze medal. And that's when I burst into tears, because so much work had gone into that from the training days and in Mammoth with Coach Vigil and Bob Larsen and Meb. And then all of my family and friends that were in the stadium, a very huge crowd in the stadium that was cheering for me. It was quite a special moment to be able to share that with them. Definitely aware what Deena and I have done over the years is kind of reciprocate. If I go before her, she gets energy from me. Or if she goes before me, I get energy from her. In Athens, she was a week before me with the women's race. And she did it. And it was foreshadow almost for me. What we're doing is right. I was so happy for her. And kind of confirmed that we were on the right track and now it was my turn to see if I could do it. On race day for the men, it was extremely hot, humid. We knew it was going to be that way. So it was essential that he pace himself wisely. And in that race when he went by the 10-mile mark, I'm standing there and looking at him, and he's signals me with a thumbs up, and I'm going yelling, just perfect, and he looked like he was the strongest guy in the course. He ended up running 2:11.30 and got the silver and had a real shot at the gold late in the race. For me it was pretty special just because my personal coach happened, you know, when the finish line, he's, like, he's the head coach for the distance runner. To be able to have that moment was huge. As usual, he one-upped me by getting a silver medal, but I couldn't be more proud that we could pursue that goal together and come out victorious in pursuing it. We came in with two Olympic medals. It wasn't Kenya. It wasn't Ethiopia. It wasn't any other country. It was Mammoth Lakes, California, with 7,500 people that have two medals with just one mile of each other in this whole wide world. I think with our performances in Athens that it really opened the door for American athletes to know that they can compete on the world stage. Altitude has worked, and it's worked for years. I don't credit it all to what Meb and I have done, but it was definitely a part of the process. And it's been amazing since then to see how many middle distance runners and distance runners are on the award podiums at world championships and Olympic games. When Joe and I started this project, it was really about trying to bring America back competitively, not just about our group, or not just to get our people on the Olympic team. In 2004 alone, if nothing else came after that, I think we would have all been satisfied. But obviously that wasn't the end of the story. But it was a big, huge part of the story. After Athens, Meb continued to run at a very high level, winning several championships. Continued to-- outstanding, one of the best American distance running careers of all time. And then ran into a major problem in 2007, 2008 at the Olympic trials, which were held in December of 2007. He had a stress fracture in his hip, didn't make the team for 2008 Olympic games. He literally had to crawl around his house at one point. It was at a point in his career where he-- many athletes would probably retire with that type of injury, and missing the Olympic games. But Meb's drive was still there. He continued to train, got better and stronger, and ended up winning New York in 2009, which was an inspiration to everybody. Then he went on and made the 2012 Olympic team, including winning the Olympic trials over a very tough field. And going to London. Let's go, Meb! Let's go! Let's go, Meb! Let's go! In London, he had huge blister on his foot, got the wrong fluid in the first aid station, and had a horrible side ache, and looked terrible. He went from being in front to all the way back to about 20th. I always say running to win doesn't mean getting first place, but getting the best out of yourself. At one point in London, I thought about dropping out. They were starting to run away from him. I just yelled, hang on, Meb. Come on, Meb. Stay with it, Meb! Come on, Meb. Then I'd say, you know what, I got New York. I already have my silver medal in the back of my pocket, and why keep going, but you know, you're do it for a greater cause. You're running for the United States. And then, miraculously, he comes around on the last loop, and he's finally looking good again. And he's moving really well. And passing guys. And he's the best I've ever seen at being able to rally when seemingly everything is wrong and it's almost hopeless. Just kept digging and finished fourth. And here he comes. He gets it all the way down to fourth place. And that again was an inspiration to everybody that's followed Meb and followed American distance running. Happy with the outcome, obviously, but I really wanted to get a medal, and I think I was capable of doing it, but fourth place is fourth place. One, two, three! Woo! Thank you. So another special moment. And one that came at an age when a lot of people doubted that he could run like that anymore. But Meb is writing history as he goes and does these special things even as he ages. Probably if it wasn't for that race, finishing fourth, I would have been at the Boston Marathon this year. It was the spectators that got killed, and I was a spectator that day. I just happened to leave five minutes prior. Otherwise, not the same direction, I was in there, just as like they were, but that's really unfortunate. You know the bombing happened, and then a couple hours later, we were at the lobby at the hotel, and they say, are you going to come back? I say, I have to come back. It's not a choice. I mean, I have to come back just because I want to support the people. Hopefully, I'll be healthy and running, and, hopefully, I can go for the win. With the first wave right on their heels, the elite men take off. I knew mile 4.5, 5 miles that the defending champion is not going to have his day. And that's where I made a move. And I said, OK, come. Whoever wants to come, come, and make it happen. And I'm ready for the challenge. Like I said, I wanted to run. My whole point after probably mile 8 is I'm going to inspire people. I'm just going to inspire people. I'm going to give it a shot. Boston Strong. Meb strong. I'm going to run as hard as I can, and if somebody catches me at the end, let it be. I'll still be satisfied with it. I will be, but they're going to work hard to earn that. And right now Meb Keflezighi is trying to put some sort of signature on this race. I'm not sure what his final intentions are, but he's pulling away from Joseph as the two men combine together to pull away from the pack. So when he did go to the lead and was out front, I was comfortable in the fact that he wasn't running too fast. You know what, I wanted to be by myself. By about 17 miles, I was hurting pretty bad now, having a foot problem, and so basically I was just saying, ignore the pain. This is for the United States and kept pushing and pushing. The two times he had run it, he never got to the 21-mile mark, which is at the top of the hills in great shape. And I said, if you get to 21 this time and you're feeling pretty good, some great things can happen, because you're so efficient running down hill. You know about 18.5, maybe 19, people are getting excited, and get into it, saying, USA, USA. I'm like, USA, USA. I'm like, I usually give them thumbs up, but I'm getting very emotional and getting carried with the crowd. And I just say, use the crowd to just drive you. And he goes up through the hills and gets to 21. When he got to 21, phew. This is going to be good. And at 22 miles into it, I got a cramp on my left side, and I'm like, hmm, this is not good, I think I might get caught. Second place runner is in sight and getting closer. This could be a little hairy for Meb Keflezighi. As we get closer to the finish line, two of the Kenyans appear on television, and they say how quickly they're approaching Meb. It is Wilson Chebet in second place who is gaining on him at this point. Meb is going to need one more little surge. He's got to be drawing tremendous energy from the crowd. That has got to help fuel him. And instinct, I guess, something tell me to look to the right, and I look to the right. And I saw an orange shirt. I have no idea who it is, how fast he ran, or what country he's from, but I say, I guess I'm going to get hunted. But now, I'm like, slow down or try to maintain the gap, or extend the gap? Nobody tells you. You just got to fill in. The lead now 24 seconds for Meb. Can he hold it together is the question. I felt like throwing up. I kind of started throwing up, I'm saying, he doesn't know that. And you know, I'm going to get caught, but I worked too hard to get here to lose in the last two months, so keep working on the form, use the crowd, and just keep digging. I mean I was in pain, but at the same time, got to do what you got to do. The men's lead now we're hearing has been shot down to 15 seconds. I had a disadvantage, because I'm going forward, and he's just targeting me from behind. How long has he been chasing me? So it was kind of hard to have to look back too periodically. You don't want to make it too obvious, because then a sign of weakness. And just do it enough to, you know, hopefully, he's not looking-- he's looking down instead of looking on my side. The clock says 10 seconds now. This is headed in the wrong direction for Meb Keflezighi. Looks like his legs are tightening up a little bit. He doesn't have nearly the same stride as he did not too long ago. Meb sneaking the peak. OK, he knows what the deal is here. They had run so fast on that 10K, and it looked like they were going to catch and go by him. And everybody felt that. But when I zeroed in on them, they weren't executing their mechanics as well as Meb was. Meb was still doing all those things he works on endlessly, all those drills. It's down to the six seconds. You know six seconds. And it was getting close. I'm gettng panic attack myself. And I knew there was a right-hand turn coming and when that turn comes, sprint as hard as I can to just diagonally, not even follow the road, but by the time he turns, just make him say, what happened. And that's what I did. And was making a left trn on Boylston, and I took one more peek, and it was more than once at least, and crossed myself. I said thank you, God, for giving me this opportunity. This is it now. Boylston Street is all Meb's. Now he's joined, but Chebet doesn't look like has much left. Meb has picked up the pace. I can see the leg turnover. It's changed dramatically here since he turned here. He saved something, I think, for this move. And he's got a tremendous shot to win this race right now. I used the crowd. I used the spirit of the victims and just keep digging, keep digging. And I really wanted to do something in my mind at the bombing site. I wanted to grab a flag or something. But I'm like, this is too important of a race. On the right of the screen, Meb feels he's got it. He's telling you when he does that, I've got something left. Frankline Chepkwany in third place in the blue. Oh, these last strides, they must be killers. He's happy. He's saved something for this, Al. It's never over until the tape touches your chest. I mean, I'm still thinking, we're on Boylston Street, don't pull a hamstring. Don't pull a hamstring. Just stay mechanic. You know. Even when I'm looking back, don't look too much where you can tangle your leg and fall, you know, that would be-- so you have to be. Every step, every move is calculated. Look at how close this is going to be. One, two, three. One last look. An American will win the Boston Marathon. Yes, he will. And his name is Meb Keflezighi. There's the line. He's across. I just felt like screaming, obviously. It's like, yeah, I did it. Woo! That took all he's made of, Larry. What a-- at a personal best. Two hours, 8 minutes and 36 seconds by almost a minute. About 50 seconds a personal best. And he will turn 39 on 5, Al. This divine intervention is because of what happened last year, a year ago for the bombing, to change that to-- which I've been thinking about for 365 days or more, to say USA, USA, USA, going through that, and people on their feet just cheering to have an American win is just a pretty cool deal. You know and I feel you know really happy that it all came together for me and the most important day of marathoning. I mean, it was-- all eyes were on Boston. And, obviously, Coach Larsen was there. And I don't know, he joked around and said, who won the race or something. You know typical of him, though. And I gave him a hug. This is something just beyond storybook that's happening to someone that you've worked with for 20 years. In 2001, it was taking on the world with a message what the training camp in Mammoth with Deena and I, Coach Joe Vigil, and Coach Larsen started. And couldn't help it to think, you know, if we believe, and we can do it, and all came together. And you know what? This is a magical moment. Fortunately, everybody I ever coached, I really liked. Really liked. You kind of appreciated them for who they were. And then you try to coach them the way they are. Not Bob Larsen's system, but what works for them. No, Coach Larsen has been an amazing person, like a father figure to me. And he's seen me grow more than anybody else. The one thing that I respect about Meb is in pole vaulting and a lot of different sports, people leave their coaches, and they go to different coaches around the country, thinking they're going to get something special from them. And it's not special. It's special in the athlete and the athlete-coach relationship. And, obviously, Meb realized that his relationship with Bob was a good relationship, and it's still going on today. So quite successful. Am I still taller than him? We really think of Bob as a father figure. It's a relationship that started back when Meb was just in high school in his teenage years. And here's Meb with three kids, a wife, and Bob has been there every step of the way. Beside the winner, Meb ran the smartest race by far. Oh. I mean, they're so much alike. I see similar personalities. They're both very organized, very tenacious. They get along so well, and they know each other so well that things get done without anything being said, because they think so much alike. That's the best way I can describe it. But it does mention the coach here at the end. I left that part out. I'm trying to get him to play that grandpa role. Leave the kids behind with him and while Meb and I get out. We painted our hands. You painted them, huh? No, we get white sand. Oh. Still working on it. I think Bob makes you understand how important you are to the team. I think he makes you feel how important you are to him. I think he takes a personal interest beyond the track in your lives. He said to me, Jimmy, the most important thing for you is to graduate from UCLA. You need to get that degree over anything else. You know the running is important, that's great, but that education, that degree is what's going to carry you through the rest of your life. I owe him for instilling that in me from day one. So that was really cool. The one thing that was unique with Bob is he would relate everything to not just running but to life in general. I've carried the skills he's taught me into how I handle my life, how I handle my coaching, how I handle my personal life. I thought we had a Hollywood star coming this way. Look at you. You know we still have a relationship with him today, because he cared and doesn't just care about winning at all costs, but he wants you to get it and to do well and to be a part of your team. You're not just a pawn in his game. I can't imagine being in any other environment where we worked any harder than we worked. And I can't think of being in any environment where it was more fun than where we were at. I mean, it was a ball. We share the same love for a guy that did so much for us. And it's remarkable that somebody can have that effect but-- and I think the reason is he's a pure-hearted man. So it continues. Larsen starts here Monte Vista. He continues on. He gets his athletes. They continue on as teachers, educators, coaches, and it's just all spread out, all over the whole world. That's Larsen. Bob Larsen has magic. Wow. I'm getting a little emotional here. There's something about Bob that he can get the best out of anybody. That's the beauty of Coach Larsen. He allows you to kind of grow on your own, you know. He plants the seed a little bit. He's there for anything that you need. But at the same time, you're going to be going on your own, so it's nurturing you to be the best that you can be. And not many coaches are that way. You know, he's a wise man, and he's a great coach. And beyond that, he's a great human being.
