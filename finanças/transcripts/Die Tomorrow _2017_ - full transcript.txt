Am I going to die? Not right now, but everyone has to die some time. - Why? - Because we just do. Why? Because we're humans. Living beings have to die. - Will I die? Like sleep and die? - Yes. Are you kidding me? No kidding. No! Very Sad Pictures presents 24 MAY 2017, 2:15AM A 21 YEAR OLD FEMALE STUDENT WAS HIT BY A TRUCK CRASHING INTO A HOTEL CONVENIENCE STORE HER FRIEND REVEALED THAT THE DEAD STUDENT HAD GONE TO BUY MORE BEER FOR A PARTY IN THEIR ROOM THEY WERE DUE TO GO TO THEIR GRADUATION CEREMONY AT 6AM - It's so accurate. - What is? My horoscope. The horoscope in this magazine is totally spot on! Do you read that stuff? - You should try it! - What does it say? It says I'll have an opportunity to go abroad and those close to me will be worried. You're going to Ukraine, right? - Kiev. - Is Kiev in Ukraine? - Yeah! - There are bombings there. - What about Aquarius? - You'll die there. Stop it, bitch! Ukraine is safe. I checked. What about Aquarius? You'll invest in a business which will be successful. - Nice! - But someone will steal from you. Is it true? Yes. Joob and I are opening a boutique. - It says she'll steal from you. - I don't think she would. - She's rich. - Did she put a lot of money in? - Yeah, quite a bit. - Really? Fuck off! So it is true! Give it to me. Capricorn? You're going to have kids. - Maybe. - Really? Hey, Prae's going to have a kid. Nothing unusual about that. I'm ready to. That's so you! Mine isn't accurate at all! It says my love life is going well. Let's rewrite it. I just had a fight with my boyfriend! I'll write my own horoscope. "You're going to meet your soulmate, who'll be a foreigner." Just imagine if you could write your own fate. It could be fun! You guys wrote your own fate anyway. You can graduate on your own, right? No, I asked God for help! Are you serious? Believe in yourself. Let me write, bitches! Yok will travel around the world. What about Prae? OK! Prae... - 6 kids. - Like puppies? Let's change Som's fate! I crossed it out... No one's going to steal from Som. - Let's take a photo. - Yeah, let's do that. So we can see if it comes true. Really? I hate spoilers! It's no fun if you know your destiny. Your feet! Don't you want to know what will become of you when you're older? Look at Jaa. That's what you'll look like when you're old! Bitch! I'm serious! I want to live in America and never come back here. Why? - You think Immigration will let you in? - Will Trump let you stay? I don't want to live here. You know me. What will you do there? I'll look for a job. I want to move to New York. I'll see how long I can stay there. Will you live alone? Yep, unless I meet someone there. Someone meaning 'husband'? - What about you? - I'll open a plant shop. What trees will you sell? Coconut trees? No fucking coconuts! Sometimes you find rare trees on the Internet. Like on Pinterest. People want to decorate their rooms with those trees. My mum also loves planting trees. Don't forget to give me one. You'll sell trees online? You'll e-mail trees? I'll start a website so I can test out the market. Sounds like a plan. What about you? - I want to be like Anna Wintour. - Who the hell is that? I want to create my own fashion brand. I'll study marketing and aim for the Chinese market. Will it work in China? I can try and make it work. - So you want to study marketing? - Yes. - Where? - In Paris. Wow! I'll learn how to saybonjour properly. What about you, Prae? I just want to have a family, the kind where we can have dinner together every day. No! Seriously? I'm serious! I don't come from the kind of family you guys do. But we are your family! Don't be sad. I'm not sad. I'm just saying that I want to have a nice family. You can have one with that guy you're seeing. Not sure about that one. Enough of this crap. Let's put face masks on. Let's go. Stop talking nonsense! What time is the make-up artist coming? 4am. I need to sleep or I'll have bags under my eyes. - Don't sleep. - Prae, don't go to sleep. You can nap during the graduation ceremony! Tomorrow is the big day! Shit, there's no more beer! Prae, you drank all the beer? No, I didn't! Go and get some more, now! - Now. - No, you go. I don't want to. - We should all go. - I told you to buy a pack of 12. Who's going? I know, let's check the horoscope and see who's going to get more beer. The lucky girl is... PEOPLE DIE EVERYDAY THERE ARE 172,800 DEATHS IN THE WORLD EACH DAY 7,200 DEATHS AN HOUR 120 DEATHS A MINUTE 2 DEATHS EVERY SECOND 11 JUNE 2012 BUSINESSMAN DIES IN HIS SLEEP AT THE STOCK EXCHANGE HE WASN'T FOUND UNTIL FIVE HOURS LATER 15 JANUARY 2016 HURRICANE ALEX HITS PORTUGAL'S COAST KILLING HUNDREDS WIDESPREAD EVACUATIONS ARE UNDERWAY FURTHER FATALITIES ARE EXPECTED Next we have the weather forecast for Bangkok. A cool breeze is expected across the city with a temperature of around 16 degrees Celsius. Such a nice day for the 'month of happiness'. Try to get outside if you can. Go for a walk and enjoy this beautiful day. Sip some hot coffee and enjoy the cool breeze. That's it for today. We'll be back again tomorrow. Goodbye. Would you want to know if you're going to die tomorrow? No. Why not? You'd be able to prepare for it. No. If I knew, I'd be sad. But you're going to die anyway. But if I knew I was going to die tomorrow, I'd be really sad and I don't want to feel like that. If I don't know, I can just live my life normally and then die. OK. 1... 2... 3... Smile. - Smile! - Why do I have to smile? - You need to smile for the photo. - No way. - Smile. - I'm not going to. You have to. Please. You have to smile for the photo. - You've been acting weird recently. - Why? Suddenly you're asking for a photo of me here. What's going on? I've been away for eight years. Can't I have a nice photo of my younger brother? - Hurry up! Smile. - Go ahead! Ready. - 1... 2... - I'm not doing this. - Smile! - Over my dead body. Don't be so difficult. You don't have to take a photo of me. The flash! Done. - You got me up here just for this? - All done. What kind of camera is this? It's so hot today. It might rain later. You can have a go. Ann, what happened to you in New York? Why? It's weird. You suddenly flew back without telling anyone. I don't know. I just wanted to come back. - That's not it. - Why? There must be a reason. Did you lose your job or something? No. I had a great job. It was well-paid. - Did your boyfriend dump you? - No. - Haven't you got any friends? - I have lots of friends. What do you want from me? What did you come back for then? I told you, I just wanted to come back! Most people would have a reason but you've clearly lost it. You're the one who's crazy. Why do you keep questioning me? Was there anything you didn't like over there? No. Everything was fine. - Did you quit your job? - Yes. What are you going to do here? I can't support you. I'll think about that later. Did you see what I got you? What? The record player you asked me to buy for you. It's on the table. That was two years ago. I messaged you but you never replied. No one uses that kind of stuff anymore. Oh really? You asked me to buy it. I asked you but you never replied so I forgot about it. - I read all your messages. - Weirdo. How did you get it here? I put it in a box. You took it on board? What? It's weird. How many times are you going to say I'm weird? You're really weird. What do you take me for? This isn't you. You're being too nice. Normally you'd say that it's too heavy and that I could just buy it here. Stop it! This neighbourhood hasn't changed at all. Look at those old electricity poles. It'll never change. Thailand doesn't give a shit. Is Pichet Restaurant still open? Yes. Why? Let's have some fried oysters there today. - Not today. - Let's go! - It'll be crowded. - I'm already hungry. It'll be crowded. We'll have to queue and it's going to rain. Let's go day after tomorrow. No, let's go today. It will be less crowded day after tomorrow. We won't have to queue. It'll be less crowded. You never try to please me! We'll go day after tomorrow. You're not flying back tomorrow. Are you planning to stay long? Are you upset? I'm heading down. You're not coming? I want to sit here for a while. Are you using your motorbike tomorrow? No. You can take it. 6 AUGUST 2013 A WOMAN ON A MOTORBIKE WAS KILLED AFTER AN ELECTRICITY POLE FELL ON HER A TAXI DRIVER SAID HE SAW THE WOMAN PARK HER MOTORBIKE BEFORE TAKING A PHOTO OF A PUPPY NEARBY BEFORE THE ACCIDENT I was close to her since I was little. But she died suddenly... I was shocked but I didn't cry. It seems like she calculated it. It's like she'd planned to leave this earth, waiting for the right time to depart. As I grow up, the list of things to do just keeps getting longer. Her death has been a turning point in my life. I keep telling people around me that I love them. I hug people. I kiss my parents. I'm not embarrassed about it. Adults don't usually do that, but I do. What do you think about the notion that human suffering and death are inevitable? It's a fact of life. Where did you learn that? It comes to us all. Did you learn that at school? Yes, but I disagreed with my teacher. My teacher said death is the worst thing, but I think suffering is worse. - It depends. - Why? When we die, we feel nothing, but when we suffer, we continue to suffer. 22 APRIL 2014 AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL LOST CONTACT WITH A FLIGHT BOUND FOR THE US THE PLANE DISAPPEARED MYSTERIOUSLY AN EXTENSIVE SEARCH WAS CARRIED OUT OVER THE OCEAN BUT NO TRACE WAS FOUND It's good to be aware in advance or I'd be in trouble. Who would ever remember the expiry date? Anyone would. To renew a driving licence, you need to retake the test. I was so busy, I forgot. How will I survive without you? How will you survive without me? If I die, no one's going to remind you. We talk about it as if it's totally normal. It is normal. Can you get the nail clippers for me? I know but... We talk about it often and it depresses me. Why? I don't think it's depressing. It's good to know beforehand. Or do you want me just to disappear into thin air? It's good. It's like they're giving us time to prepare. Who are "they"? I don't know. But when you talk like it's normal it feels like... ...you're giving up and you want to die. Normal people don't talk about death often. But it is normal. I'm going to die before you anyway. See, you're talking like that again! Over the last long weekend in April, there were lots of accidents but the hospital didn't call. It's so hard to find someone who can donate their heart to me. - There's May Day. - May Day isn't a public holiday here. It's a three day weekend this year. Most people probably already took their holidays in April. People die every day. So every day brings hope. I'll have to wait until the New Year period... But I don't think I'll make it till then. You're talking like that again! I'm really tired. I feel more tired these days. - Enough. - Should I lie to you? No, but you're talking about it as if it's completely normal. I told you, it is normal. It's fate. - Put your feet here. - It's OK. - Why? - You don't have to. I'll do it. Come on! I like doing it. I've been clipping your nails all this time. Do you really enjoy clipping nails? Bit late to ask now. If I didn't enjoy it, I wouldn't have done it for you all these years. It's always nicer when someone clips your nails for you. Just like beer tastes better on draft than in a can. - That'll do. - Why? I don't want to get used to it. You can. Just find a new girlfriend to clip your nails for you. None of my ex-girlfriends liked doing it. Only you. Left foot. Your heels are cracked. Did you never use the foot cream I bought for you? Sometimes. Use it then. That cream was expensive. It's OK. It's so dry. - You don't have to do it. - I'm not. You can do it yourself. Why is your skin so dry? Without me around, you'll need to do things yourself. You're talking like that again! I can do things myself, but I'm not sure I'll survive living alone. You'll have to. You're going to the US. You can practise living alone there. I'm only there for a week. Where's your passport? Shit! See? You're so forgetful. What if you miss your flight? It's here. Don't forget to renew your passport. I'll do it when I get back. How can you live alone if you're like this? I'm not done with your feet. I don't think my soul can be reincarnated. I'll have to be a ghost so I can watch over you. That'll be good. Then you won't be alone. If I forget to do things just come to me in my dreams. Done. Are you feeling achy? No, not really. I'll just go and wash my feet. I'll come back and give you a massage. Come. - Your shoulder is really stiff. - Yeah. I'll miss the feeling of you massaging me. Sure you don't want anything from America? I'm sure. Will you be all right on your own? Yes. I'll be back. Sometimes we think of death as being normal, but does it still make you feel sad? Sure. Is it possible not to feel sad? If you already understand it. No... No, because I'm still a human being as far as the laws of nature are concerned. I still hold on to love. I dread departure, loneliness, disappearance. I'm scared of feeling heartbroken. I lost my wife. She died first. I was very sad. Then my son. It was so painful that they died so suddenly, leaving me to live alone without them. I should have died before them so that I wouldn't have to feel this pain. Do you think there's a positive side to death? Is death a good or a bad thing? I don't think that's the point. The point is whether you've lived a good or bad life before you die. Young people like you shouldn't hesitate to do things. Do good things, then you can be proud of yourself and you can be happy. 17 FEBRUARY 2015 FAMOUS THAI-SPANISH ACTRESS 'FARI' FARIDA FERNANDEZ WAS HIT BY A CAR OVERSHOOTING A BEND WHILE GETTING OUT OF HER CAR TO HELP SOMEONE INJURED IN A MOTORBIKE ACCIDENT Shit! Such a horrific crash. Poor her. - She must have been hurt really badly. - It must have been nasty. Scary. Please don't play the clip again. Calm down. She's OK. Don't take any calls from journalists. I'm going to make a call. May, just a bit longer to wait. We're preparing the next set. How will they replace her? Shooting is day after tomorrow. What a nightmare for the organisers. They can't postpone it. May, have some fruit. Everyone's upset. I just saw a clip of the accident. She was helping someone and now she's the one who's injured. Poor girl. If you're hungry, let me know. Her condition is worsening. The doctors say she might not make it. Seen this? "Please help Farida. Blood type A needed urgently. "You can donate on the 3rd floor of Ramathibodi Hospital." Please share it on Facebook in case anyone can help. Someone must be able to help, but who? I think I know someone with that blood group, but I can't remember who. Is it Parn? There must be someone. - Call her. - Yes, I will... ...although I'm not sure it's her. Someone shared my post. Let me call her. Sorry, I messed it up. Please fix it for her. - Sorry. - Don't cry, or you'll set us all off. Wait a second. Hello. Yes, we're so shocked. Farida was a perfect fit, but I'll check if the client thinks May would be suitable. It's quite sensitive. OK. I'll let you know. Are you OK to take this job? I'll be right back. Hi. Can you talk right now? Remember that brand ambassador job I told you I wanted? I just got it. I've been picked as a replacement. Lucky, right? I'm happy. Really happy. - May, repeat the slogan three times. - OK. Ready? Camera ready? Roll camera. Action! Want fair skin like me? Use Demain. Want fair skin like me? Use Demain. Want fair skin like me? Use Demain. Cut! Is this the positive aspect of death? Can it be beneficial sometimes? What does death mean to you? Disappearance. Can you explain that a bit more? To be able to rest in peace. How do you know you'll be in peace? Most people think when you die, you... ...feel nothing. How do you know? From Reddit. - You read that? - Yes. So you searched online about death? When I first learnt about death, I googled it right away. 4 SEPTEMBER 2016 TERNG'S FRIEND POSTED ON HIS FACEBOOK PAGE THE LAST SMS TERNG SENT HIM BEFORE COMMITTING SUICIDE THAT EVENING "MARK, PLEASE TELL MY FRIENDS I THANK THEM FOR EVERYTHING "I'M SORRY FOR BEING SO SELFISH "I DON'T WANT TO BOTHER ANYONE ANYMORE "THINGS WILL BE BETTER WITHOUT ME "EVERYONE TRIES THEIR BEST "BUT I'M TOO WEAK FOR THIS WORLD "THIS IS THE ONLY TIME I CAN BE BRAVE "GOODBYE, MY FRIEND" TERNG Lek! What is it, Terng? Can we talk? Go ahead. I don't want to bother you, but you didn't answer my call. It's nothing. I just wanted to tell you I'm going. Where? It's nothing. I just want to ask you to do something. What? Will you say you love me? We've talked about this. I know. You don't have to take me back. I just want to hear you say "I love you", then I'll go. I can't. Sorry. Just go. Terng? Terng? He asked me to tell him I love him before he goes. No, I didn't. Maybe. If I were you, I would say "I love you". We'll be in trouble if he actually does commit suicide. It won't help. If he jumps, it's not my responsibility. But you'll be in trouble. What if he does go ahead and do it? None of my business. Let me try. Give it back to me! Sure. What do you want? - Chinese hotpot? - No. You choose then. Thai hotpot. Thai hotpot? OK. So boring. Did you see the news? About the karaoke? What? Is this real? I want to get out of this cycle. I'm too lazy to be reborn. In our lives, we experience so many different feelings. I'm tired of repeating it endlessly. So if I have to die, I want to become nothing after. I love everyone in my life. My parents, brothers, sisters, friends... But I'd still like to become nothing all the same. Even if you have to depart alone? If I can really become nothing, then yes, I would. Today, there's really nothing. What do you mean? It's Monday but there are no phone calls or messages. Isn't that good? No. It's such a boring day. It's a good day. How come? It's too free. It's good to be free. The day goes by so fast. Are you going anywhere tomorrow, Dad? Dad? 30 NOVEMBER 2016 A VETERAN MUSICIAN DIED PEACEFULLY AT HIS HOME IN CHUMPHON PROVINCE Are you afraid of death? - Are you afraid to die? - Afraid to die? I wish I could die as soon as possible. I'm not afraid of death. I've lived for 102 years. I'll be 103 in July. I don't know how I've managed to live this long. In my time, 100 years was the longest humans would live for, but I'm still alive. Maybe it's a genetic thing. Or some kind of error... ...which created my life. Beyond our life, there's something that controls us. Somebody is controlling our lives. And whether you like it or not, you have to follow what is destined for you. That's 'destiny'. Who can know what destiny that transcendent being will have in store for us? How can I answer that question? Have some water.
