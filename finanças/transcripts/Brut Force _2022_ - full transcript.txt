Mama? Marcos? Thought you were giving me the silent treatment. It's been months. You could've said goodbye when you left but I get it. Look, someone's messing with us, harassing the pickers. Harvest just started and people are leaving left and right. Is your mom okay? No, not really. Well, why call me? You're a journalist, you're- - On hiatus. I was gonna say nosy, but you could help us, Sloane. Famous last words. Look, you can't stay away forever. Sloane, please. I do have a small opening in my schedule. Hey George. Hey Sloane. Welcome back to Santa Lucia where it always smells like cow shit and sour grapes. Hey Sloane. Oh, hey weirdly grown-up Marcos. But Arthur can't hire new workers without giving them a place to live. He's building a spot over on East Palm Court. Has anyone talked to Arthur? He won't fight back. And the cops won't come downtown for us. Any idea who's behind it? There's so many people in this town who wish we were invisible. I've only got a few days. Come on, Sloane. Mom's always talking about your journalism and stuff. I'm supposed to start school next month, but I can't leave if things are like this. This is the blend that put Gold Rush on the map. Let me know if you want to revisit anything and please take your time. Oh, Dulce, meet Sloane, my one and only stepdaughter. This is Dulce, she's my right hand around here. Pleasure. Hey, they're on number four and try and be nice, would ya? She writes for "New World Wines". Always. How'd they like the pinot? She liked it. He thought it was peppery. Wait till they try the 2016. Exactly. Nice to meet you Sloane. Okay. Let me get this. Didn't touch a thing. Just like your mom used to- - Thanks. Didn't see much of a crew out there. Ah, we are a little shorthanded. Everybody seems to want to work for Mariela Vicu√±a this year. What's her secret? You worried? Never. As soon as our new worker housing gets up and running next week, we should be golden. Good to have you home, Sloane. Unexpected. I won't stay for long. Well, I'm honored to have you. Oh hey, gotta be careful, there's a lot of fuel for a fire out here. How long you worked for Arthur? Worked on the vines about two weeks and then we started talking. Been inside about a month. He's a good man. Indeed. I'm sorry about your mom. Arthur told me she passed away in the spring. I'm sure she was a wonderful woman. Well, you didn't know her. You had any trouble since you started working here? Trouble? No. Trouble can't touch me here. Heard any rumors? I don't get out much. Indoor cat, huh? Hey! Hey! Watch it, pal. Hey, Sloane! Gerry, nice bike. Thanks. Nice mustache. Thanks. Hey, you see a guy all in black run past, smelled like dead meat? I haven't seen or smelled anybody out of the ordinary tonight, Sloaney. Okay. Hey, I get why you left without saying goodbye, I do. At the funeral, I just wanted to tell you how sorry I am. But you know, it's like my girlfriend says, you know, the past is the past, the future is a mystery and the present is, well, a present. It's good to see ya, Ger. Yeah. I have said repeatedly power lines within 8.75 yards of private homes means that each one of us are guinea pigs for big telcom's latest radiation tech. Thank you for that, Alice. See you next week, I'm sure. And now Ms. Patty Ernst, county supervisor. Oh please, you can just call me Super Patty. We can skip all the fancy formalities, yeah. This is about safety, neighborhood safety, the safety of our precious community, safety and security, security for our children. We know how important farm workers are to our little community, but commercial housing and residential neighborhoods just do not mix. Arthur Stendhal's new facility would force over a dozen strangers into a quiet neighborhood. For Joe Dunney's wife, Barb, home alone while he's traveling for John Deere or for little Sue Ellen Mason who loves playing outside with her dolls. I move to change Zoning Law 647 tonight for the safety and security of our community. All in favor, say aye. Aye. All opposed. The motion is defeated. Can you believe this? It's hard to beat a Stendhal around here. God, you're telling me. Hello? What? Sloane! You happy now? No more farm workers making your neighborhood unsafe. Arthur. Oh Jesus. '06 Zin, best of the harvest. Prefer an IPA. Hmm? Kidding. What are you gonna do without that housing? Oh, don't worry. They think this'll keep us down. It's just a hiccup. Some hiccup. Who do you think did it? I think it could have been any one of those fine citizens at the meeting last night or maybe it really was an accident. Uh huh. You know, I've been working this land ever since I was old enough to hold a pair of shears. Grandpa always wanted me to concentrate on school, but I couldn't wait to race home and work in the vines. I know this story. Yeah, did I ever tell ya your mom wanted me to give the place up? "Take me to Tuscany," she'd say. But I couldn't do it. And so she became the best damn co-owner I could ever imagine. Low bar. You used to race home to work in the vines too and interview the pickers. I still have your first article. Missed the Pulitzer by... This place. It's in your blood. And it'll stay that way. Hey, have you seen Dulce? She was supposed to come in early and stock up for us. Not a glimpse. Do you mind keeping an eye on things for an hour? I've got to go down to the cop shop and give a statement. You think they're gonna do anything? I think they're probably relieved it burned. I was hoping you could help me once you've dried off. We don't open till 10. I'm not a customer. He bite? It depends. On? If I'm in danger. You're safe here as long as you like Cabernet. I wouldn't know a Cabernet from a fruit punch. Just the man for me. I'm looking for Dulce, Dulce Lopez Castillo. My friend's sister. She hasn't been home for weeks and they're worried. Seems to handle herself just fine. So you know her? I wouldn't say know. What would you say? She works here. I need to talk to her. Well, she didn't come in today. She's a sweet kid. She's kind of a magnet for trouble though. Would you know anything about that? Well, if she shows, could you have her call me? I'm at Bettie B's. Riverside Ave. That's the one. What's wrong, bedbugs? Not since the '90's. Room 305. Tico, Tico Reyes. Sloane Sawyer. Just in case. How'd it go? Just small town cops trying to do the least work possible. Hey, Gerry said he saw you the other night, almost knocked him on his ass. Sounds about right. First the fire, now Dulce. It's not turning into a great day, is it? This kind of thing happen often? No, she's reliable. I used to let your mom have the tough talks with employees. Can we leave her out of this? Sloane, we can talk about her. We should talk about her. You must have questions. I don't want details if that's what you mean. Well, I barely saw you at the funeral. Well, I had to get back to work. Look, I know it can't have been easy for you to be away when she died. You can talk to me. No, Jesus! I just miss her, Sloane. So you haven't heard from Dulce? No. Do you know where she stays? No, actually I don't. Cell number? Yeah, it's right there on the register. At the tone, please record- - Voicemail. Catch you later. No room for the competition, huh? I just know what's best for this town is all. And what's that? Safety and Security. You've been to one of my rallies? Oh right. Well, I'm county supervisor, Patty Ernst. Sloane. You registered to vote Sloane? You heard about that fire down on East Palm Court? Yeah, it's a pity, but it's a good thing they contained it before it jumped over to anybody's home. Sloane what? Sawyer. Nora's girl. Yeah, I guess you do look like her. She knew my brother pretty well, you know, before he cleaned up, of course. He's working on my campaign now. Thinks I have a pretty good shot at Congress. Well, they can have you. Hey! What are you playing at, girl? I'm on my way out. Excuse me. Hey, private property. This okay? Can't stop you. Timothy. Sloane. I didn't recognize you with all that artwork. Yeah, it's pretty cool, right? You know that guy's name? Nope. You see the fire last night? I was tucked in tight all night, officer. There's seven people who'd swear to it. Chill dude, just asking. Good riddance. Seriously? This is a residential neighborhood. Yeah and what'd you think the workers were gonna do, reside here, right? Be gone, college girl. Hello? Oh, looking for somebody? Where is everyone? Big wildfire down past the canyon. They're saying it might jump the freeway. So our boys headed out this morning, left me here to take care of things. Is anyone investigating the East Palm Court fire? A doozy, huh? Lucky it didn't set that whole neighborhood on fire. People are so reckless. You think someone started it? Do I look like I work for the ATF? But I know an accelerated fire when I see one. They find anything on the scene? Haven't had a chance. God knows how long they'll be on that wildfire. Worst I've seen in 40 years. Thanks. Hey. Hey, you guys okay? Well we're not on fire, yet. Well, it's true. I saw the fantasma, but he got away. Sloane Sawyer. Bettie B's Motel? Hi, could you put me through to Ms. Dulce Lopez Castillo's room? Oh, the phone's down in there. I'd try knocking. Gosh, I just can't remember which room it was. I know I have it here somewhere. Might want to try writing it in a safer place next time. Thanks for the tip. Hello? It's Sloane, Sloane Sawyer. Hello, Sloane Sawyer. It's really nice to hear from you. Right, Dulce, she's actually staying at your hotel. I'd check it out, but I'm busy. I'll see what I can find out. Meet me at the Bar-with-No-Name, eight p.m.? Should I wear my cowboy boots? Just got a busted sign, that's all. I think it's called Marvin's. Yeah, it's a date. Oh, hey Sloane. Hey listen, I'm real sorry about earlier, you know? I hate to fight with you. Always have. I come in peace. I wanted to see if you heard from Dulce. Dulce? I did. She called, she's laid out with pneumonia. I told her to take all the time she needed. Hey, are you free for dinner? I'm cooking. Can't make it. All right. Hey! You again, what's your problem? Mistaken identity. Are you following me? It's a small town. Well, you cruised down the right street. Seems to be kind of an epidemic around here, flat tires. There's lots of sharp rocks. Yeah, that must be it. Work. So I bought Bettie a drink, diet orange soda to be exact, loosened right up. Dulce left suddenly a few nights back, emptied her room, paid her tab. She's gone. Hmm. What can you tell me about Dulce? She had great penmanship. No, no, it's true. I saw her jotting something down one day and it was, it was beautiful. She said she liked letters, like little worlds. So what'd, she want to be a calligrapher? She'd be good at it. You're a pretty good friend, aren't you? What do you mean? Well, you said she was a friend's sister, right? It's a lot of trouble to go to all by yourself. He's working, I had some free time. You getting in? How are you doing Sawyer? Hey Jen, long time- - Yeah, yeah. Nice to see your ugly mug, kid. Last time I saw her, let's just say someone ended up in the hospital. So what can I get you and this handsome fella here? Bourbon, rocks. Same. Ah, so you put somebody in the hospital? One of her regulars was drunk, not that drunk, and got a little fresh so I may have broken his arm. Okay. You like to dance? It makes me feel less like I'm going to explode. One more drink? No, no I better not, I'm driving. Where to? Man's best friend. You're looking at little flushed there, princess. Bourbon. Rocks. Sorry. So I want to know what makes a girl leave town without saying goodbye. Were you nervous I wasn't gonna be here when you got back? Deflection. Intrusion. Thought I was getting too deep on the first date eh, Sawyer? I hate the circumstances but I can't help enjoying the company. Where did you find this? It's Dulce's. There was a fire the other night, my stepdad's new worker housing. Let's go. What did the fire department find? The whole place went to fight that wildfire south of the canyon. And why didn't you tell me about this earlier? I didn't know if I could trust you. I'll let you know what we find out, Ms. Sawyer. You don't need to miss me, Gerry. We've had bath time together, I've seen you naked. I'm a police officer now, Sloane, Ms. Sawyer. I need to be proper, professional and all. Sorry, I'm just a little shaken on account of that barbecued human jaw I just unearthed. You think it's her? The damage is too extensive to tell. I'm sure fire will send a team in, maybe they can figure it out from the teeth. What's the hold up, McDonnell? Quit flirting with the witness. You should take his job someday. Thanks, Sloaney. You know that guy. Yeah, he's just a friend of the family. Doesn't seem to care much about burned body parts. Oh, I almost forgot, a little bit of orange soda goes a long way. It's Dulce's, you want to see if she left anything behind? Why don't you check it out and report back? It's not far. What, are you trying to get me back to your place? I can't go in there. Place must be haunted, right? Bettie B got to talking, said that some people have died there. Did she? Yeah, a woman. My mom. She'd been clean for years, but then one thing led to another and then she overdosed there. Oh my God, your mom. She was here and I was a million miles away. Goodnight. Car trouble? That's why they've got Gus's Banana Towing. Best in town. You know, I was surprised to see you with the competition last night. What? That slick fellow you were with, Alejandro Vicu√±a. Vicu√±a? Yeah, aren't they Gold Rush's biggest rivals? He said his name was Reyes. Alejandro Reyes Vicu√±a. I looked at his license. Why don't I know him? He went to some fancy East Coast boarding school, but he's back now. Whole place will be his one day if Mariela ever. Thanks Ger, I owe you one. Bettie B's Motel? Can you put me through to room 305? Checked out. What? I'm gonna miss that fella. He was cute. Get that for me, will ya? She's dead. , I don't believe you. That's not gonna change the facts, mother. They found her bracelet at the fire. What took you so long? I was gathering information. Dancing at a bar. That's just what I heard. You have little birdies everywhere, don't you? You make me sound like I'm some sort of spy. Is it that Sawyer girl? I heard she's back in town. She's nothing. What kind of nothing? The nothing kind, mother. She's just a sad girl in over her head. Hello. Alejandro, don't just stand there. Thanks, Alejandro. If Arthur wanted to see me he could've just called. I'm sure he has my number from the many times I tried to buy that vineyard. Arthur doesn't know I'm here. Huh. Alejandro, dale. Mezcal, it's my special recipe. I've been importing it from Mexico long before it was so trendy. Alejandro was just telling me about Arthur's fire, very unfortunate. He didn't say whose fire it was. Little eavesdropper, aren't you? Is it true that our Dulce was there? That she, that she died in the fire? They, they have to examine everything before they're sure. They only found parts. She's been with us for years. You know, like a daughter to me. She's not your daughter. Alejandro, Alejandro please, just give us a minute. Okay, please. Let me take a look. You're a tough cookie. It may not be her. I thought they found her silver bracelet in the ashes. You know, that was a gift from us, that is Bradley and me. Your husband? Yeah, he was a real connoisseur of jewelry, wine, other things. Here, look, all found on the property. My great, great grandmother probably skinned a mountain lion with one of these. Let me show you around. - Oh... - Oh, I insist. This dirt is in my bones. Limestone, gives our wines their special minerality. Wow! This is my favorite place in the world. Nothing could ever take me away from this land. I hope nothing tries. Will you help me find our Dulce? I'm afraid for her. Please. Fine, okay. Well Sloane, it's been a pleasure. Oh. Harvest time. Hello. Grapes everywhere for the picking, hands stained red. Too much work to be done. Hey Sloane, listen please. And why should I do that? Because I can explain. Pretty line. I mean it. You don't mean anything, not even your name. Tico is a nickname. Cute. It's what you call somebody from Costa Rica. Well, I heard it's lovely this time of year. It's where my dad is from, okay my birth dad, until he skipped out years ago. Let me know where to send my condolences. Bradley was a real father to me my whole life until Mariela kicked him out. She talks about him like he's dead. You don't know what you're getting yourself into here. Yeah, well funny how that happens when you hang around with a liar. Okay, I deserve that. Yeah and a lot more, but maybe I'm too sad and too in over my head to know better. I didn't, I didn't mean- - Sure, none of us meant. Sloane. Vicu√±a blood runs deep here, Sloane, as deep as it can get. Mariela chews people out and she spits them out, but they don't come out looking the same, they look more like Picassos. Hey, next time I need an art history lesson, I'll call you. Hey, I lied, okay, but not about everything. Alejandro? Run home, Alejandro. Alejandro? Seems like you're the person to ask about history around here. I just like to figure out how the puzzle fits together, you know? And what kind of puzzle are you piecing together? What can you tell me about the Vicu√±as? You're working with your step-daddy, right? That's right. Here land is everything. The Vicu√±a family had two branches, Chumash Indian and pure Mexican. So they think of the land as doubly theirs. And then, well, you know what happened. European immigrants like the Stendhals come in and grab whatever they can, original owners be damned. But the land remembers. Remembers what? Mariela's family history. Arthur's people? Newcomers. Trespassers. Excuse me, dear. Get the hell off me. Don't you know this is private property? Who's gonna pay for all my tires, huh? You always were asking to get hurt, weren't you, Timmy? You're a bitch. Moving to LA just made you worse. Now I'm a professional bitch. Doesn't look like it to me. You came crawling back home... You're no better than the rest of us slugs. Do you think it's funny to terrorize farmworkers? Got a thing for dead skunks? Smell better than you. Tough guy, huh? Remember that I once broke your arm? I can do it again. Out with it, what's with the skunks? Well, it was pretty funny. Hilarious. Good money too. What? Shit! I'm supposed to go out tonight. Who's the lucky lady? Okay, okay. Look, that pretty Mexican girl paid me 100 bucks every time I messed with the wetbacks. Are you surprised it was her? See, girls can do anything these days. Did she say why? She didn't say nothing. Keep my mouth shut and get creative. You're an artist. Did you set that fire too? No. Shit, no! Are you kidding me? I'm from here. Look I'd never do something so stupid as starting a fire in dry season. My mom lives next door. Fine, I should call the cops. Good luck getting them down here for me. Don't ever mess with the workers or my car ever again. I still know everyone in this town, got it? Juana? Oh, hi Marcos. Hey, listen, I found out who was doing all that stuff at the motel, a little chickenshit named Timothy Fitnall. Yeah, from the neighborhood. Anyway, you guys can rest easy tonight. No, don't thank me, just get some sleep. Juana? Oh Marcos, I'm sorry. That son of a bitch. He needs to be locked up for this. Yeah, well I called the chief on my way over here and he says his nephew, Timothy, must've been provoked. They're not gonna do a damn thing. It's a sin. The workers are not safe. And whose fault is that? Brought you some coffee with your sugar. Oh thanks. Where'd you get that? The fire. Have you really heard from her, Arthur, or are you lying again? You know Dulce worked for the Vicu√±as? What? Mariela wants me to find her. Well I see you've finally met Mariela, huh? Yes, I had that distinct pleasure. She thinks it's all hers, you know? Everything. Do you know where Dulce is? No. Getting to be a real pain, Alejandro. Please, nobody calls me that except for my mother. Well, she's a peach. Is that her? Have you heard anything about Dulce? What, your little stooge? Not yet. What do you mean, my stooge? Oh, you know how she was paying angry locals to harass Arthur's pickers. Last night, one of them beat my friend so bad he ended up in the hospital. Must've gotten a nice, pretty bonus for that kind of blood. That can't be true. I don't know anything about that. You don't know much, do you? It's my mother, she- - Believes this land is hers, ancient feud, yada, yada. I wouldn't exactly call wholesale theft of native land a feud. Yeah, you're right. But does that justify her paying for felony assault on farmworkers? That's a cute trick sending a sweet girl like Dulce. No one's gonna suspect her, right? She just does whatever Mariela tells her. Well there must be something in the water over there at your place, Vicu√±a. I don't do everything she says. Okay. All right, you're a big boy, a free thinker. Yes. So why do you lie for her? Some lies are necessary. Is that what she tells you? And you believe her? I thought I did. Where's Dulce? I don't know. Well if you find anything out, hear anything, could you please call me? Back again? Is everyone still gone? Fire's still raging. And what about East Palm Court? They found a body? You bet, big fella. You mean it was a man? Sure was, bad teeth. Hey, you seen George lately? Not for a few days. How long exactly? Monday, no Sunday. You know where he sleeps? Abandoned buildings mostly, said he found a new place recently, it was under construction. What are you trying to do here, Sloane? Look, you are number one on the chief's shit list right now, I'm not supposed to help you, I'm not even supposed to talk to you. I wish you'd seen Marcos last night. He's lucky he lived to tell the tale. Keep your voice down. Why, what's going on in there? Why was your chief so chummy with Alejandro? Mariela owns the police. What are you doing here? Remember that little arson you all forgot to solve? I think the body was George. No. Shit. Yeah cow shit and sour grapes. You need to arrest Timothy Fitnall. You've got to get outta here, Sloane. I don't think you can win this one. Well, neither can she. Juana, are you packing? What? No. Here's your food. What's wrong? You must think I'm pretty stupid. What are you talking about? Well, I'm done protecting you. What do you mean? I mean I called your patrona. Mariela? Goodbye. No Arthur, please. Please, help me get away from here, please. Talk. We had a plan. You and? Mariela. It was her idea to harass the workers. How could you do that? It's easier to scare them than to pay them more money. That reminds me, you owe me a couple of spare tires. I did it for my daughter. Your daughter? Well, where's she? I don't know. Mariela, she took her away. And why is that? It was her husband's baby... with me. So she said the baby should have been hers. But she is flesh of my flesh, she is everything. Okay so... So Mariela kicked her husband out and she took your kid? Told me I had to help her get Arthur's land. And when I told her I was sick of it, she said if I burned down Arthur's building, I could have my baby back. And instead she sent her sicario with a gun to kill me. So I escaped back to Arthur. Arthur. I told him I was being stalked by a boyfriend so he helped me hide out here. He told me about your mom, how beautiful and smart she was. Yeah well, here we are. Forgive her. Forgive yourself. And why should I take advice from an arsonist? I never hurt anyone. I just wanted my baby back. Except George. Who? In the fire. It was empty. No. Oh my God. Hey, stop it! How is this better for your child? You can't just decide not to be a mother! You don't know what Mariela is capable of. Well, you better hurry. Come on, go get your stuff. You've reached Arthur Stendhal. Please leave a message and I'll get back to you. Sloane. Oh Jesus. Somebody took Dulce. He's a big guy, I've seen him somewhere before. It must've been Cuco, by mom's muscle. Sleeps on the job. Sloane, I can't believe that she did this to you. Well believe it. Dulce's back at our place. She's contrite as all hell. Mariela won't say a word to her. Shit, if I had known that she was hiding out here- - What would you have done? Where you trying to help her get her or back for Mariela? I thought Dulce was a homewrecker, sleeping with my stepdad and breaking up my happy family. Dulce's a child. She was eaten alive by this happy family of yours and now Mariela's holding her baby hostage. Sloane, I made a mistake. I'm not like her. I know. I need to fix this. We have to find that baby. ‚ô™ Oh I wonder who's buying the wine ‚ô™ ‚ô™ For lips that I used to call mine ‚ô™ ‚ô™ And I wonder if she ever tells him of me ‚ô™ 1978, the year I took over my grandaddy's farm, also my first vintage. And this is the last bottle. I was saving it for the day I retired but what the hell? Grapes rotting on the vines, houses on fire. Arthur. What is it, Sloane? Gonna give me another one of your trademark withering looks? We need your help. You and? I'm Alejandro Vicu√±a, but most everyone calls me Tico. Get off my land, Alejandro. Arthur, he's with us. Can we talk about Dulce? Mariela took her kid and now she's holding it like some sick ransom. We need to help her. I'm tired, Sloane. It's her child. Yeah, why don't you get the police to do something? They're dirty, you know that. I'm tired. It's just grape juice, Arthur. No, you're wrong there. It's earth and sand and water. It's poetry in a bottle. It's grape juice. Is it worth separating another mother from her child, getting innocent people beaten up and worse? Is it worth holding my mom hostage? That's not fair. You could have taken her to Tuscany. You could have taken her anywhere. She gave me a life. She gave me you. This land's all I've ever known. But maybe it's not a blessing, maybe it's a curse. Why don't you get out, Sloane, huh? Get out while you can. I'm here now. All right. You go in first and don't let on- - Never seen you before in my life. Exactly. Find Dulce. I will. What's your plan? We're adults, it's time to act like it. Nicely done. Very clever. Stole my harvest right out from under me. You are hurting innocent people. Am I? Where's the child? What child? Don't play games with me, Dulce's child. Arthur, there never was a child. It was a still birth. Poor girl went half crazy with grief. Just let the child go, please. And you can have it all. Tell me, tell me what we've longed to hear for 100 years. You can have the whole rotting valley. Arthur, there never was a child, just a very, very sick girl. She's so manipulative. Weak old men are her specialty. Now what were you saying about that precious vineyard? What is that? Cries all night. What? Who? Must miss her mother. Can't sleep. Where is she? So much crying. Someone should really shut her up. Sloane. Look Dulce, I found her. What's wrong with her? Mariela gave me something for the pain. We got to get out of here. She told me my baby was dead. She's right here. Give me back my child. Damela! Alejandro? We are a family. This is your fight. No, they're my fight, not you or this land. What have I always taught you? Violence. Mariela, please. You and your family have sunk your teeth into stolen land for too many generations. You taught me to fight dirty and I will fight until I can no longer breathe. Let's go. Get them. I'm right behind you. Where's Arthur? I need to find him. I think he's hurt. You should get them out of here. Get them somewhere safe. Sloane. You wanted to get away from Mariela? Do something right. Go. I need an ambulance. Down at the dunes. Yes, that's right. Hurry. Arthur, I called an ambulance, it's on its way. You're gonna be fine. I took your mother here on our first date. I'm sorry that I left when she started using again, I was just so angry. You were living your life like she wanted you to. I was here with her all the time, I couldn't do anything. It's not your fault. You're a good daughter. Please, please Arthur. Just breathe, okay? The ambulance is coming. We'll fight for the land, we'll fight for the vineyard. It isn't mine, not really. All that shit about "been in the family for generations." You know how my noble ancestors made their first wine? The blood of Indians, slaves. This is blood-soaked land here. Anything else you hear is just a pretty story. The land, it's in your mother's name. It's all yours. No, it shouldn't be mine. You got a fire in you, Sloaney. Tell the old story, then tell a new one, a better one.
