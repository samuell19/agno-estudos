It's not fair to you or me not to ask the name of such a beautiful lady like you Beautiful lady, what's your name? Why should I tell you? What a amazing lady! Of course, she's the miss of the Wan Ma School You just reached here today? How did you know? What do you want? Our boss would like to invite you to come to the Wan Ma School for dinner I only attend big parties Wan Ma School has got 3,000 picul of wine, how's that? Enough...See you tomorrow I've promised you already, why don't you leave? I've been instructed to invite 6 but until now I have only invited five Oh, it's him Not only he isn't willing to buy drinks for others he is also not willing to accept the invitation Where are you sending the coffin at this late hour? These 6 coffins are intended for the Wan Ma School Because they said that tomorrow 6 people will die there Did you order these 6 coffins? I haven't seen him before Who told you to deliver them? It was an old lady Where's she? Lying in the last coffin Is it this one? That's correct Stop, he's Ding Qiu, the Terminator His followers, the Five Ghosts are all expert professional killers Once you open up the last coffin you'll surely be blown to pieces Pal, you're right They are really the Five Ghosts Attack Wait, this is just the beginning There'll be a lot of opportunities to meet in future Pal, you've experienced a lot I also know that the man who invited us to the Wan Ma School has gone Pal, are these coffins to be delivered to the Wan Ma School? Yes, how did you know? The word is, six will die at the Wan Ma School tomorrow Don't move What is it? Nothing, please How do you know that these coffins are empty? Because professional killers wouldn't use the same method to kill Wan Ma School of Guan Dong Guest Wan Ma School is really something Looks like we must all die here tonight How's that? Nothing. It's said that Wan Ma School has 3,000 picul of good wine If we were to finish it all we will drink ourselves to death You said that there'll be 6 guests here today Where are the others? A guest is here Please get some men to carry Mr. Le Da He's already drunk before he arrived Hero Wan, please Please Mr. Le Da, take care... No need to help me, I'm not drunk Where's Wan Ma School? Where's Wan Ma School? This is the well-known Mr. Le Da, the Drunken Fairy May I ask how often do you change your clothes? What? How often? How can you live with that I must change at least once a day But Mr. Le Da has never taken a bath his whole life Bathing will hurt the vital energy So you should never bathe, never Oh! Didn't you have 4 persons in your carriage? Where are the other two? One is here already You have sharp eyes Flying Spider's light technique is really great You flatter me Are all the guests here? One more A guest is here Sorry I'm late I am Gong Sun Duan; please Wait Our boss has only invited you Please ask your men to retreat Whoever dares to draw a sword in the Wan Ma School will end up like this Retreat, who told you to draw sword? Go... Please... Anything else? No one ever carries a sword into the Wan Ma School Please If one's sword skill is bad he might as well not carry one like me No one ever carries a sword into the Wan Ma School No one ever carries a knife either Never? Never What about you? Aren't you a human being? Let me tell you, my sword lives and dies with me Stop This must be Hero Fu the one who's so difficult to invite? It's him Since you are here, please come in... He's carrying a knife... I can only see him, I don't see his knife Please How come he can bring his sword but not I? How am I supposed to know? Go and ask them Come, let's have a drink, cheers... Cheers... May I know why you've sent for me? The swords and horses of Guan Dong are unique Have you heard this saying? Of course It refers to Shen Dao School in Guan Dong 20 years ago and the present Wan Ma School But today, twenty years later the martial arts world knows only the Wan Ma School and nobody knows about the Shen Dao School It's because, 20 years ago the chief of Shen Dao School was assassinated one snowy night And on the same night 75 sub-leaders of the Shen Dao School were beheaded too In this regard, did you invite us all here for a special reason? That's correct Did you hear noises from poultries on your way? No Do you know why? Maybe no one raises chickens and dogs here No, the Wan Ma School used to have 120 male dogs 78 female dogs, and a thousand chickens but they all died last night These people must be either sick or utterly bored Can't you see what's their intention? What? Absolute extermination Why? How else could future troubles be prevented? Does it mean that the murderers of ten years ago showed up at the Wan Ma School today? If not them, who else could it be? I still don't understand You should be the one seeking revenge How come they are here instead? Haven't you heard the saying that whoever strikes first will have advantage? We only arrived here yesterday This incident also happened yesterday That's why the Chief's convinced that the murderer must be one of us We are invited here today to find out who the murderer is Could he be found? Of course not It's not written on his face It's unlikely that he will admit it I don't think I can find him out now If not now why do you want us here today? It's late now, and your way back home is long I've prepared accommodation for you all Please Let's talk about it tomorrow, how about that? Who is it? It's me Miss Ma, what is it? Return money to me? No, I'm here to ask you for a favour What favour? It's been said that one of you wants to kill my dad I hope you could tell me who he is How do you know that I am not the one? I believe and hope you are not Tell me who he is I only knew them today How am I supposed to know? Are you using sword? Do I have a sword in my hand? That's better Because I've heard that the murderer may use a sword How can you be so sure? Never mind, it's not you anyway Stay in your room tonight and don't go anywhere, understand? Alright I'm leaving Chief has found out that that man was really sent by Ma Kong Qun and has asked us to kill him When? Midnight, and to kill Ma Kong Qun at the same time Have you hidden those dead bodies yet? Yes, behind Hero Bai's grave Close the door Blow out the candle Who are you? I'm here to serve you Why me? What? You don't like me? It's not my responsibility if it's broken You crude bumpkin Even the most foolish person won't want you tonight Who's she? Help... It's bad Auntie Wait for me Mrs. Ma? Are all the 6 guests here? All except Ye Kai Today is the death anniversary of Hero Bai We've just paid respects to him Do you know Hero Bai? Why should I? Hero Bai used to have a son but since he died, his son disappeared Is he the same age as I am? More or less It's said that his son carries a sword That's right When did you arrive here? About the second watch Did you know that someone died in the Wan Ma School? I could guess Why? Follow me There are 6 coffins here, these 2 are empty The other 4 have dead bodies in them Yun Zai Tian, Flying Spider, Murong Ming Zhu They all died before 2nd watch Because they were here when I arrived Impossible, I saw them just now You take a look at this coffin everything will be clear What? He's dead too You may have seen dummies just now Chief, you've found Ye Kai at last Unfortunately, he is not the killer Then who is? He's one of you Maybe you don't realise that Le Le Shan has been working for me secretly I've sent him to check on all who come to this place Just now he might have found out who the killer was and was killed by the murderer Then how do you know that Ye Kai isn't the killer? Because they are real, while you are impostors You killed Murong Ming Zhu & the others before midnight and then dressed like them and killed Le Le Shan and in the confusion you want to kill me too Didn't expect the one who is after my life to be the follower of the Thousand Masks I know that there should be four of you Where's the other one? In fact I knew this before I've seen the fourth coffin Only a friend could kill Gong Sun Duan and you do happen to be his friend Fa Man Tian, I treated you well why yet conspire with the Thousand Masks to kill me? I have followed you for 20 years and have gained nothing I have served you almost like a slave if you were me, would you have done the same? Besides, the Thousand Masks promised me a million tales of silver and half of the Wan Ma School on condition that you and they be killed Are you nuts? We have no connection with Wan Ma School why would you want us killed? Save the bullshit Thank you both for helping I really don't understand why'd the Thousand Masks be after us? I don't understand why Ma Kong Qun tried so hard to invite us to come and let us get away so easily? What did he retain us for? He ought to have killed us Who are you? My name is Ye Kai Why are you bullying this old gentleman? He killed my mother and I want revenge Right What is it? Hope you're aware of already being in 7 Star Formation? What? Are you here to kill me too? True, that's what we are here for We kill for a living, attack Why don't you fight? They aren't here to kill me What? One star Two stars Three stars Four stars Five stars, six stars Don't come over, or I'll kill her Hero...don't let him kill my wife What? She's your wife? That's right, they threatened us to trick you Alright, I'll stay here Dear Old man... What are you up to, you want to kill her? Why would she die? She's the Deadly Spell Lady Du What? It's well known that the Ximen Chun couple is ruthless I've seen with my own eyes today Unfortunately, not only I cannot heal but I only kill Before doing away with me can you tell me who hired you? Of course, it's the chief of the Wan Ma School Ma Kong Qun How about that? Can you die now? Yes, but not me, it's you Aren't you going to help? They aren't here to kill me What a calculating person you are It's not for that reason that I don't fight It's just that, in the Peach Wood there's still someone Another one from the Wan Ma School Men from the Wan Ma School really want to kill you But I am waiting for you For what? Because one of you must be the son of Bai Tian Yu of the Shen Dao School You are here to seek revenge from Ma Kong Qun who killed your father What? Bai Tian Yu was killed by Ma Kong Qun? That's right Who are you? I am the maid from the Bai family I've been hiding with the Ma family for the past 20 years eagerly awaiting for the descendant of Bai Tian Yu and to hand him the list of his enemies Ma Kong Qun, Xue Bin, Guo Wei Le Yin, Xiao Bie Li, Zhao Da Fang, Ding Sheng Feng Didn't you say there are 30 of them? How come there are only 7 names here? Because Hero Bai had killed 23 of them and there are only 7 left For you Why? Because I am not Bai Me neither No, one of you definitely is Because my madam said that 20 years later young master will come on the day of Hero Bai's anniversary with a sword to seek revenge You are here tonight and it's indeed Hero Bai's anniversary San Niang Old Master Come in Old Master, what do you want me for? Retreat Yes Where have you been? I... I'll say it for you You're here for 2 persons at the Peach Terrace, right? Tell me, it is Fu Hong Xue or Ye Kai? I...I don't know From the first day you were here I've already known who you are Do you know why I didn't kill you? I want you to find out who's the son of Bai Tian Yu I know that once he appears you will be the first person to see him Who is it? Why should I tell you? I already know that there's no point asking you Men Deliver these 6 letters and tell them that Bai Tian Yu's son has come back Yes Are they here yet? They will be here tomorrow You'll be leaving today? I just passed by here Really? I heard San Niang's story yesterday Only you and I are the ones seeking revenge Of course I know who I am so you couldn't be just a passer-by Hey, somebody is bathing in the middle of the street Someone's bathing in the middle of the street Taking off the clothes... Hurry... Hurry Yes Hurry...hurry and bring some water I have to kill somebody after I bathe Brother, who do you want to kill? Anyone by the name of Fu Hong Xue and Ye Kai in here? Yes I am here to kill them Who are you? Who are you then? We are the two who you want to kill Your boss wants me to kill them? Bring my clothes Do you know that I must accomplish the task once I've made the promise? I know that So you don't have to worry Of course I don't Then you can die now Didn't you say you want to kill both of us? That's right, I don't like being used by others Actually, their main purpose is to ambush you when we are fighting How can these five guys kill us? Not only five! How come you have joined us? You still don't understand? If they kill you I'll have no business at all From now onwards, apart from me No one can kill you Now it'll be your turn to kill us I never suffer losses in business I won't fight until they pay me Who hired you? You want to know? Follow me Wan Ma School Hurry...hurry... Help What happened here? Our chief was beheaded and died What? How do you know that it's Xiao Bie Li? He's the only one who's got dominoes in his hand Where's Xiao Bie Li? He's out for business Who are you? I've come here to clean up Had you been a cripple I would have thought that you were Xiao Bie Li Go Although you are not lame I still know that you are Xiao Bie Li You are smart, you've been pretending to be lame to fool others when you have to run for your life Why did you kill Ma Kong Qun? Because he killed Bai Tian Yu So you wanted to silence Ma Kong Qun You are right Why don't you fight? Three ain't necessary to fight against one When you all die, I'll fight You... Attack What are you doing? You killed my father and pretended nothing has happened Stop Be smart and leave or don't blame me for being unkind I don't need your kindness Stop, let me do it You are the only one who can move I must take off your clothes and then your skirt If you don't go, you'll be naked soon I'll settle this with you one day Let's go... You do have a way with girls Women are that way, there's no point explaining to them As long as you say you'll take off their clothes there's no need to say anything else Oh, still have some guys hiding behind Where are you going? None of your business Maybe someone wants to hire me to kill you It's better for you to look for me then If I'm not wrong, he must be going to look for the third killer, Xue Bin How would you know? Because he seemed to be very interested in what had happened 20 years ago Waiter Save your breath, there's nobody here How do you know? I bought this inn yesterday The dishes have been cooked for you, please try it How do you know that I would eat? This is the only inn around here Wouldn't a man feel hungry after walking a 100 miles? Endless flow of heroes' blood, innumerable enemies when would all the bloodshed and the feud end? Who are you? I am the one waiting for you here How do you know that I would come? This is the only way to Hero Heights Are you from the Xue family? I am the son of Xue Bin Others call me Xue Da Han Are you full? So? Better to die with a full stomach than to die hungry How come you are fighting here? Do you need to select the right place to kill? Of course If I kill, it must be in the garden Blood spilling on the flowers does indeed look pretty Unfortunately, today you needn't raise a finger you are so crude in your technique to kill Too fast Why don't you come down and try? I bet, in just three moves he could kill you If you want me to come down I fear you'll die even before I come down 1,2,3, dead Three moves, I was right I suppose you could tell me what you were doing up there I wasn't alone upstairs there was someone else too If I hadn't watched him he might have been at your back right now Not necessarily I am here too How did you come? I heard others say on the road The Nine Ghosts in White got an assignment to kill you here So I came here at once I little expected when I entered at the back that I would see him hiding here, so I... So you killed him If I were correct he could be the real Xue Da Han It appears I have no part in this either Farewell Where are you going? Don't worry, I am not going to die Didn't you say my life is reserved for you? Where are you off to now? Are you headed for the Hero Heights? Why don't you answer me? Damn, so obmutescent why don't you be a dumb instead Great, I am hungry Hero Heights Fu Hong Xue Yes, the ground was covered with red snow But his surname should be Bai (white) 20 years have passed Master...wine Have you carried out the assignment I gave you? Altogether there are 35 staff of the household They have all been asked to leave I gave each 500 taels of silver Ought to be okay to run a business for rest of his life Great There are 1,530 taels left in the treasury Good Take it all with you I am not leaving How come? Master, I am 68 where could I go? Alright, have a drink Is your surname Xue? Never mind, I am the one you're looking for Take out your weapon No need It's time Yes, master What else do you have to say? I'll serve you even in heaven I can talk to you at that time Good Why is the blood black? They were poisoned Why are you always following me? I fear you might be killed Is the wine poisoned? A potent poison Since they have already taken the poison why commit suicide? Because they didn't know there was poison in the wine So somebody else put in the poison? Naturally Who? The one who wanted to silence Xue Bin But they were alive when I arrived Maybe you arrived too soon or they died too slowly Too bad there's no one else left in Xue family so no clue could be traced Look for Guo Wei at Jie Fu Lane if you want the truth Guo residence Anyone here? All dead? Damn Who are you? He is the one I want to kill, I'm the one to kill him What are you doing here? I don't know, someone asked us to come here You have been called here to kill? Kill who? My father Guo Wei Unfortunately you are late he killed himself yesterday Nonsense, your father has not died How would you know? If he were really dead why there aren't any relatives here to pay respects? I'll bet you anything there's no one in the coffin Come Oh, this copper gate is extremely heavy Ah, so Miss Ma is here! Uncle Guo, they killed my father Who is Bai Tian Yu's son? My name is Lu He says neither is he Bai Tian Yu's son Don't try to fool me If it were not for vengeance why are you looking for me? But your search ends here anyway because I don't see how you could escape this copper gate Attack What's wrong with the gate? Nothing I was just holding it from dropping down You conspired together? No, it's coincidental that I came in You fool, I'll kill you Don't move Who initiated the ambush on Hero Bai? Let's go It seems the killer has definitely followed us all along Miss Ma... Why don't you stop and listen to my explanation? Save it. You killed my father so I must have my revenge Miss Ma, that day at your place didn't you say you didn't think I was the killer? You fooled me. Which is why I hate you even more So how could I convince you? You can't Alright then, have it your way Lu Xiao Jia once said it's useless to explain to a girl Just strip her naked and there'd be nothing left to explain You... If you still don't trust me, I'll pull down your pants Hero Bai, you died so young Such a great hero to die by petty mens' treachery Hero Bai, you died so mysteriously All I have to say is: I sincerely hope you won't be lonely in death Who are you crying for? A great hero my life saver What's his name? Bai Tian Yu, chief of the Shen Dao School Who are you? You needn't know Could you be... How much do you know about what happened at the nunnery 20 years ago? I know this day his son would seek revenge Who told you that his son would seek revenge today? He himself Who are you? I was indebted to him I have waited for those to come here to avenge him Why? I know the one who killed Hero Bai would pass here these few days I hope his avenger would come in time Where is the murderer then? I still don't know But my informant would come today How long has he been gone? 3 years Could he have died? No, he is called Jin Feng Zi truly a man of his word If he had died he would return even lying in the coffin Is there anyone by the name of Zhao? Look, he's really dead I haven't died Jin Feng Zi The murderer is already here I dressed up like this for fear he might recognise me But we managed to recognise you regardless Let's go, quick I knew he would come to kill us both Where is he now? There is a restaurant east of the town That man must be there tomorrow afternoon How old is he? Around forty Coming... Please sit Drink? No Never? Not now You don't drink before you kill? How would you know I'll kill you? You look menacing You could tell? I could feel it You have confidence in killing me? I would not have come if I don't You must be quick with your sword Quick enough Good You may draw your sword anytime What, you again? You know him? Yes What is he like? Affable He wants to kill you because he has been tricked Is he your friend? No I haven't seen you for long; pick up the sword Strike me Where's your flying dagger? You're not like your teacher I don't think even I could dodge his flying dagger If you really want to be great you must have a great heart like your teacher How's Li Xun Huan? I haven't seen him for a while either You are the student of Li Xun Huan? Yes Then he... He is uncle Ah Fei Hero Fei What's this all about? Bring them in here Yes These two are playing tricks They wanted to use you to kill Hero Fu How do you know? Here's the story I passed by a peak one day and saw a few men dressed up in mourning They and the ones carrying the coffins looked weird So I decided to tail them and found that they were looking for Hero Fu When Hero Fu left those men carrying the coffins returned Then I knew that something fishy must be going on so I went up and asked them If I am right You must be Yi Da Jing, the Iron Hand Scholar You are posing as Li Xun Huan and inviting me here What? You are Yi Da Jing You are the fifth killer who killed Hero Bai If I am not Yi Da Jing why should I kill you? Wait All our men are here It's not that easy to kill me, attack Attack... Why did you kill them? I still have a lot to ask them I... I've not killed for over 10 years Do you really want to avenge Hero Bai? Then you should check out at where Hero Bai died Nunnery Are you here for offerings? For quite long no one has been here for that How long have you been here? I can't even remember how long I can only remember that the day I came out the Buddhist statue had just been consecrated Then it's almost 20 years Are you looking for someone or seek some information? Sorry, I never accept tea from a stranger You are so cautious That's why I'm still alive Really? You know... firstly you should ask me who I am Haven't you said that already? You are Le Yin once known in the martial world as Madam Peach That was 20 years ago The 6th killer of Bai Tian Yu That's right, 20 years ago outside this door we killed Bai Tian Yu I still remember that 20 years ago it was snowing heavily The thirty of us dressed alike used the same weapons, wore masks because we were afraid that he would recognise us But his martial arts skills were exceptional When he died, out of 30, only 7 of us were left Not realising that 20 years later I'll be here to kill his avenger Kill Now you only have one option Tell me who sent you the message that I would be here? How did you know that there's someone behind this? Every place I went, they were fully prepared and finally at the last moment, the killer was killed You are no fool But you wouldn't know that because he's the one who's always at your side I found it strange too that you were always behind me The 7th killer of Bai Tian Yu is you, Ye Kai Who says it's me? You may have forgotten that of the 7, there's one who's an expert in disguise, the Thousand Masks They were using such technique to provoke us to fight each other What a good move! What's going on? Aren't you afraid he'll run away? I've hit his vital point What are you doing? What do you want? If I don't do this how am I supposed to know if you are an impostor Then let me do it too; don't run I'll pinch you What are you doing? How am I supposed to know if you too are for real? Do you know who he is? Needless to say He must be the 7th killer Ding Sheng Feng Why did he kill Le Yin? Do you know that this disguise of his means the Thousand Masks is alive That's correct. If he were dead who's going to make the disguise for them The Thousand Masks is not yet dead Which means that others could still be alive as well Where are the others? Master Ding can bring me there The Xiao store again The dead men are all here? They are all here There's something I find strange All those who killed Hero Bai are experts How could they have died so easily? They planned well They first found a dummy for each of them and killed them later This would lead us to think that our enemies were gone and they could then escape When did you know that we weren't dead? Ding Sheng Feng shouldn't have disguised as Ye Kai This way I came to know that the Thousand Masks is still alive If he were alive implies that all of you are alive too Why do you have to follow us so closely? Because he has to avenge his father He's the real son of Hero Bai That's correct. 20 years back you are the ones who killed my father My mother named me Fu Hong Xue to make me remember that when my father died, the ground was all covered with red snow(Hong Xue) I should have known it just by your name Ye Kai, why do you have to go against us? Because Hero Bai was the best friend of my teacher He knew that Fu Hong Xue wanted to avenge his father so he asked me to follow him and help him Looks like history will have to repeat itself tonight But before you die tell me why you have to kill my father Needless to ask all things in the martial arts world are that simple Men in the martial arts world for 20 to 30 years must have killed a lot of people regardless of who is right or who is wrong. And each of these people would have parents and brothers who would be after me today for the same reason Stop meddling with him This story should come to an end tonight Bring the net Attack I believe that you won't be able to get away from this blaze net Looks like our efforts will pay off What have you got to say before you die? My words are: You must die today Attack Wait How come you are here? Didn't you want me to kill them? That's why I followed them here What? Is there still a deal between us? Stop, he's my friend No matter what, all that happened here tonight shouldn't ever be leaked out I don't kill for free Don't make me break my rule What? Ma Kong Qun, you... Didn't he say that what's happened here tonight shouldn't be leaked out Didn't I say that? I must kill you tonight Leave me with this bastard Ma Kong Qun You are the only ones left here You can't be dummies You'll get to know that later They are real, be careful I, Lu Xiao Jia, have never been ambushed from behind by villains before I must seek revenge But Hero Lu, he killed my father I've been in the martial arts world for 20 years and have always kept my word But I have also waited for 20 years No offence intended, how can I not avenge my father? Hero Lu, what are you doing? Because I have to kill Ma Kong Qun with my own hands Why are you fighting? He has killed the one I was supposed to kill Are you in this for money? No If there's no money involved, why be so angry? Besides, even if you kill him now no one is going to pay you So, wouldn't that be doing this for free? Besides, I don't think you are good enough to kill him I can't accept this That's simple Let's have a contest Whoever drops his pants first will lose He will be a bastard for the rest of his life and has to greet the winner as grandpa Good. Fu Hong Xue, mind your dick Here's the result, Lu Xiao Jia, you'll be a bastard for the rest of your life Who says I've lost? Your clothes are in his hands, haven't you lost? Didn't you say "pants"? How could I have lost if I haven't worn pants?
