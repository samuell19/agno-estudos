There is a mystery other than all those solved so far. There is a mystery other than all... What does Omer Khayyam say... ...about mysteries we are unable to solve? I will tell you. I will tell you. There is a mystery other than all those solved so far. There's a light, other than all we saw. Don't ever be satisfied with whatever you've done. Go Ahead. Don't ever be satisfied with whatever you've done. Go Ahead. There is another thing to do, other than all done before. There is another thing to do, other than all done before. Are we filled up again? That's my job! A weed is all you need. This is good. Recently, in an ancient Byzantian library... ...as i was idly leafing thru an old book, i came across a story. I takes place a long time ago in ancient Greece... ...on the isle of Crete, where a monster was terrifying the people. A wise man called Daidalos saved the isle from the monster. Now in time, the king began to think: "What if this man one day locks me up in the dungeon, too?" I would better act before he does! So he shut Daidalos... ...and his son I karus in the dungeon. Daidalos ve I karus knew there was no way out of the dungeon. Gazing out of the one small window at the precipice... ...below the foamy waves breaking on the wild rocks... ...he lost all hope. One day he saw a flock of wild geese over the sea. Suddenly A bright hight went thru his brain. Trapping geese... ...he plucked all their feathers. Gluing them together with wax, made a pair of giant wings. He tied these wings securely on his son I karus and... ...said to him: Listen, my son, listen carefully to what I say. Don't fly too low. The humidity from the water will wet your wings... ...weight them down and you will fall into the sea. Don't fly too high either... Or the sun will... ...melt the wax from your wings and you'll fall down. So from my experiences, I would say, moderation is best: Always take a middle course. I karus threw himself from the window and freed at last from the unescapable dungeon. He keep on flying and flying. He keep on flying and flying. But... ...in the joy of flying like a bird, he forgot his father's advice. After soaring higher and higher... ...the sun melted the wax from his wings. The feathers came apart and... ...I karus, like a big, plucked bird... ...fell into the foaming waves of the sea and was lost. Would he dare again to fly? They do not move their wings up and down like this. They move them forward. How can they stay in the air, then? Look! The wind! Hey, Ýstanbul! Blood for blood. My subjects, what do you want? The head of those... ...responsible for the murder of Hüsrev Pasha. Why do you act like this? They are my bosom friends... Is there no other way to settle this conflict? I can't give you those heads. Of course, you can! Or we will think of another way to settle it. Blood for blood! You have the Prime Minister's seal. As the first assignment, you will behead all those dogs out there! My Sultan, those people out there are all brave soldiers... ...they have often risked their lives for the Ottoman State. Their very rebellion now stems from their concern for the well being of the State. Permit to tolk to them before I take up my sword. We want blood for blood! Abdi Agha, come near me! It is allright. Send the men away. They are dispersing. How distant do you think the moon is from the earth? You'll find out when you get there. Do you think I can get there with those wings you will make? You fool! Even when the birds can't fly to the moon! How do you know the birds can't get to the moon? A scientist never presumes, Hasan. He measures, weighs, calculates, proves. To your health, my Lord! To our health. Shall I tell you once again what you must do to preserve your good health? Are you crazy Musa? Would I give this beautiful head of yours to those mad dogs? I would gladly sacrifice this head for you, my Lord. Come Pasha, come and sit by me here. My lady... Don't be impatient, Recep. Our work is not done yet. As long as you have this passionate ambition... ...you will always get your way in the end. I've given birth to savage like Osman and a lunatic like Ibrahim. So Murat is a child's toy for me Neither my parent, nor my family and even if... ...God himself were to stand between me and my sovereignty. God forgive me! Come my Recep, it is time for work. First, we must finish our work. 50 coins and no more. 70 and no less. Greetings, Ýbrahim. What is the problem with that girl? I guess she owns that box. What is inside the box? I don't see what you find in these infidel scripts. This is my job. Bekri! Bekri! Wke up, you big lush! What's up fellow? Is it the end of the world or what? Stop asking questions. What are you talking about, what is happening? Come on, Bekri, get up, will you! I'm not going anywhere. What's the rush, Evliya? Live each moment fully, enjoy life. And you know what Khayyam says. You blind! That earth, that heaven, those stars are all vain. Leave this and that and live to your heart's conrent. In this forever dissolving and evolving universe... ...all you will ever take is a breath which also is a vain. All right, Bekri. You win. You always have an answer to everything. Is all this rush just to get these papers to our friends? They are not just any papers, Bekri. Look at them! I found these papers in the Slaves Bazaar. This Algerian pirates who plundered the Venetian ship, sold these papers in Istanbul. Hasan, this fellow seems to have found the solution to the riddle puzzling us. We must have them read. What language is it? All knowing Evliya, tell us what language this is? I can't make it out either. We'd better show it to our Venetian friends. Come on, then! Let's go see our friend Antonio. Child, we just got here. Let's take our breath first. The sky is overcast, there might be a storm tonight. We may not be able to see the stars. What I am trying to say is that now we are on this island. Whatever happens around us, happens... Never you mind, do not care. Never miss a moment. Live it to the full. Neither fear the future, nor dwell upon the past... Murat, my son! You will be the grandest sovereign inheriting this... ...empire sprawling on 3 continents. The reign over it well, you must have loyal men around you, not cowards and traitors. Neither Musa Chelebi, nor Mustafa, nor Hasan Caliph is traitor or coward. May be not, but your soldier don't like seeing them around you. Who will govern this country, mother? I or the military? What is the meaning of these remarks? Get Musa for me! They can't get him, my son! Musa isn't in the palace. He's gone. Gone? Where can he go? Doesn't he know those bloodthirsty dogs are lying in wait for him? Where is Musa mother? At Imrahor. Under the observation of Recep Pasha. I'm ready. Who ordered? Who is the Sultan? Of course, you are, my son. You were only 11 years old when you become Sultan. We used to take all the important executive decisions together. No, mother, not together. You always made the decision by yourself. Then what is changed now, my Murat? Musa is done with. Good. Musa is taken care of. Now it's Murat's turn. Where is Musa Chelebi? Recep Pasha, how did it go? Your orders are executed my lady! What order? What is this all about? Yes, my son Murat! As before, I personally made the decision. Fearing your emotions might err you and thinking the safety of the epire... ...I got a decree from the Chief of Islam authorizing the execution... ...of Musa Chelebi, Hasan Caliph and the Chancellor of the Ex chequer Mustafa Pasha. The decree has been carried out. Don't cry. Henceforth, your soldiers will fully trust you and Recep Pasha. Thus we will strengthen unity and peace in the Ottoman Empire. No! No, mother! You limping Bully! You'd better prepare for your last player on earth! No, my Lord! As God is my witness, I swear that... ...I never went against my sovereign's will. Get up, you infidel! Guards! My head to be sacrificed for you! Allow me to pray one last time. Do you think your sins will be absolved with one prayer, you dog? Hasan! Eureka! What do you want? Look, do you see how the oar goes in the water. Forwards and backwards like this. Like the wings of birds forwards and backwards. You have ruined my lovely dream. Tell us what you were dreaming? I can not. Why not? Because I have promised. Whom have you been promised? My sweetheart in the dream. You clown! I almost took you seriously. What is wrong with what I say? How serious can your promise to a phantom be? How do you know she is just a phantom? What if you yourself in somebody's dream. How come Murat has not closed this inn? Even the Genoese hadn't closed it. How can Murat touch it? Was this inn a drinking place even during Genoese times? No, it was a court house then. It became a wine cellar in Byzantian times... ...and a drinking house under the Ottomans. Come in, young fellows. Don't you fear the Sultan? Why should we fear him? I guess you are not from Istanbul. Murat's prohibited alcohol drinking. Haven't you heard? Yes, we have heard that but... They say Murat beheads on the spot anyone caught drinking. I have got immunity, young man. They can't touch me. What is the immunity you speak of? Cross the soldiers palm with gold, feed the janissary aghas well... ...then you, too, can drink to your heart's content. This Istanbul, my friend, you give and you take. And is Murat unaware of this? How could mama's boy? All he does is fool around with girls in his Harem. Meanwhile here we go on enjoying. Even see him? What does he looks like? I saw him once. He is just a scrawny adolescent. Hey, stop, young man! Stop it! Hey! This is Murat. Yes, indeed it is Murat! My Lord, with due respect, when the people of Istanbul wake up tomorrow morning... ...seeing the corpses hanging on the trees, they will be intimated enough. Please, by your leave, let's call this massacre off. But we've just started, Pasha! Now let's go over to the other shore of the Golden Horn... ...and see how the people there are honoring the Sultan's law. How strange! I wonder what this silence is all about. Strange! Apostol's inn is also closed. Agop, it is us. Open the door. It's us, Agop. Why don't you open? What's happening? Who are we hiding from? So you've turned your wine cellar into a pub? That's typical Greek mentality! What do you think, you clown? What's the Greek mentality like? If I hade your Turkish mentality, there'd be water in your cup now... ...instead of this ravishing wine! So, Sultan Murat is walking around the city in disguise... ...and taking lives like the Angel Of Death. I only hope to God that Bekri can keep out of trouble. Take a sip, gentlemen. On the sea everything must be shared. Sonny, slow down! This stuff is not as innocent as it looks. But there is a way to enjoy everything. Go slowly. Savor the taste. Tell me what life is all about! You brat! I said savor it, not gulp it down. What a hothead! Look at my face, fisherman, see if you can recognize me. How should I recognize you, lad? Or did those two sips of wine go to your head? You are going too far! Don't be angry gentlemen. Anger is harmful. Look at the beauty around you. Live, my lad, live! Alright, so I could not recognize you. Forgive me and tell me who you are. I am Murat, fisherman, I am Murat. Which Murat? Murat the fourth! Give that damn thing back to me! If you drink some more, you'll be telling me that your companion is Duce Mehmet. What did you say to them? If you are Sultan Murat the Fourth, then I am the emperor of China. Hush! Search everywhere! Yes! He poured it in here! You little kitty! Let's go. Stop, Evliya! That's enough! Ahmet, do something! He's gone! What have you done! You've killed him! You little rascal! Forgive my soul. God! I must be getting old. God! What is this?! Uçmuþ bunlar be. Baksana adam neler anlattý. As Agop told, the fellow's sworn re establish law and order in Istanbul. But what a way to establish law and order! Going on like this, he'll only establish the hatred of people. You just wait and see! Tomorrow all the people will be worshipping Murat! That is the mentality of the shepherd. Instead of separating right from wrong he just kills off everyone. Who cares? Let him kill. We shall all be dust in the end anyway. Exactly! Life is short. I want to enjoy it, not live fearing death. Why do they always prohibit what is joyful? Drinking coffee and wine, laughter and loving are forbidden. If I can't enjoy these things, how am I different from this hanged man? Greetings, gentlemen! You nearly gave me a heart attack. Gentlemen, you were all talking so bravely. But now you look Ike you have seen a ghost! You dare laugh at us, lad? I will show you what a ghost is! This is my Murat, fellow, Murat the Fourth, himself. The youth in the boat? Exactly! The youth in the boat. Is this the time to play jokes on people? You little fool! You're right. But, suppose that I really am the Sultan. And I confront you and say: "You foolish men, have you not heard of my decree?" We'd say, yes, Sultan, we have heard of your decree. We know all about your orders. But as Khayyam says: You hold the decree while we hold the hearts... ...we're more sober than you in this drunken state. You drink human blood where we drink the blood of grapes. " Have a heart. Which one of us is more wise? Come on, get moving. So, my Sultan, would you like to come with us? If you stop calling me Sultan. Fine with us. We won't say it again. Now let's go. You walk ahead, I'll catch up with you in a moment. Shall we take them, my Lord? No. I'm going with them. But what should we do with these? Kill them off. You are at the root of this trouble. What trouble do you mean? The papers from that Italian ship. The drawings of wings. He insist that it's impossible for a man to put on wings and fly. How can you be certain if you have not tried it? Are your arms a like wings? Of course not, this I know. If I put on wings... Can you flap them like a bird? I will experiment. Why shouldn't I succeed? If the birds can do it... If you do so, the nerves and the blood vessels in your arms will get tied in knots. How do you know? Do you see? What do I see? How can you say so without seeing nerves and blood vessels. Shall I cut my arm and show you my blood vessels? Why should we cut yours? Whose shall we cut off then? Thanks to Murat the Fourth! Hasan come here. I'm holding him. You untie the rope. I'm releasing him. Why do you laugh? Why do you laugh? Come on, get up. Take a drag, my lord Sultan Murat the Fourth! Bekri! You promised! Alright, lad. Don't get angry. You don't take my jokes. Enough is enough, Bekri! He is right. Sultan is no joke! He has had half the people of Istanbul executed! How true! What kind of a man can he be? Does he feel no remorse at all? What do you say, lad? How do I know? I guess, he must feel some remorse. It can't be easy to have so many people killed. Bo they live by themselves in this huge house? Do they have a family? None! He lost his whole family during the plague. All Ahmet has is his sister Leyla and this crazy Hasan. I see. And what are they going to do with this dead body? Nobody can understand what those lunatics do. They obsessed with flying like a bird. But, what has that to do with the dead body? They are rying o find out the difference between the structures of birds and humans. But, isn't it a sin in our religion to cut up dead bodies? Answer me! Does our religion allow such scientific studies on dead bodies? God forbid! Our religion orders us to surrender the dead to God... ...who gives and takes lives in the world. Even though some physicians have the cunning inclination... ...to practice their art on dead bodies, this inclination is evil temptation. I see. How do we punish those who commit the sin? With death penalty. Have you gone to sleep? Have they been deciphered? The news isn't good. In all Istanbul, I couldn't find anyone who could work out these writings. Considering the Italian ship, I first went to Antonio Pasha. No use! Couldn't it be Spanish? So, I run to Gomez Aga. No! Armenian? I asked Artin Efendi. No luck. But Itzak Efendi says it is not Jewish. Nobody can decipher this writing! How far you've cut this cadaver! What shall we do know? I did my best. Another bad news. Antonio Pasha told me that Gaileo's recanted. You do not say! What did you expect? After all the torture he endured from the Inquisiton! They were going to behead him if he did not recant. If you are a man of silence how can you recant? I would like to see you if it is you to be beheaded? Whatever the odds are, a scientist never gives up. If you give up your scientific studies on human bodies... ...and also your idea of flying, our Sultan will pardon you. Otherwise you will lose your heads. Give me an answer. Turn them over. Quick! Turn them over! Repent you sinners, repent so that I can pardon you! Hold on tight, Hasan. We are flying away! Damn it! You Devil spawns! If it were up to me... ...I would send you to the other world without trial. But our sovereign Sultan has decreed a court trial. What is this about? This had never occurred to me! You, Ahmet Cemshid, also known as Hezarfen. You, Hasan also, known as Lagari: You are conducting medical experiments on cadavers... ...and intending to fly like birds. Do you have anything to say to this? We are trying to work out the secrets of the human body. Think of a physician, my lord. He gives his patient a drink of health giving herbs. Doesn't this amount to experimenting with the human body? If it cures, he will give this same drink to other patients. What do you say to this, Chief Physician? When you experiment with living patient you can get their consent. Did you get the cadaver's consent for the experiments? Now let's take this matter of flying like a bird. Has the Almighty God given you wings? No! Then the wish to put on wings and fly is defying God's will, isn't it? Almighty God didn't give us wheels. But mankind has invented and used it for his travels. God gave us neither wings nor wheels. But he gave us brains so that we can think. Enough, you impertinent man! Do you mean that I have no brains? Not at all, my lord. I am referring to those who are... ...unable to use the brains that God gave them. When we use our minds and knowledge, mysteries are solved... ...mankind progresses and our sufferings lessen. Sir, of all the nonsense you sprout, only the following make sense: "The mind that Almighty God granted us". But, people like you use your minds to serve your... ...personal pleasures instead of serving God. Therefore you do not deserve to have your lives spared. Instead of being good subjects of Islam... ...they are bad seed who deviated from God's purpose. My loard... ...each seed is created differently... ...as a unique individual whereupon the community is formed. Individual is the essence of the community. Wasn't our prophet Mohammed an individual too? You impertinent fool! Stop profaning the sacred name of our prophet! What do you mean by saying the individual is essential? The individual exists for the good of the community and the State. You must not ask what the State will do for you, but what you can do for the State. Otherwise there would be chaos, as everyone would have something to say. Let them! Is that bad? Mankind progress only thru the personal... ...progress of each individual's mind. Therefore, my lord, let everyone have something say! Ne demek o? Then, what would be our use and the use of our laws? To provide written proof that the strong one is right! Think of two people before the law. Who gets justice? Not the rightful, but the powerful one. As the weak one has no power, the strong one changes the law. Are you aware that with these blasphemies you are denying the laws of God as well? My lord, we only believe that we should use the mind... ...granted to use for the benefit of mankind. Instead of trying to fly like birds why don't you use your brains... ...to invent a new weapon that will make our armies victorious against our enemies? That's exactly what we are doing! How so? The great Sultan Mehmet had to struggle many years to be able to conquer Istanbul. Because the city was surrounded by wals and the sea. Ans what of that Sultan of Sultans, Süleyman the Magnificent himself? He who made the Ottoman Empire the greatest... ...the most widely spread kingdom on the earth! He couldn't conquer Vienna despite the siege for years. Because Vienna is very well protected by walls and mountains! Lmagine that our soldiers could soar over the walls of Vienna. They would suddenly see our soldiers flying above and... ...dropping barrels of gun powder on them! While the infidels run around like chickens... ...we would capture the city from within. Victory would come from the sky! Oh my! But this is Murat! This is Murat, the lad in the boat! From now on, no more experimenting on dead bodies. Understood? Understood, my lord. As for the flying... ...go ahead! Funny Lagari! You are so funny! Tell me the story about the winged soldiers again. We take young children training them to fly adeptly. As they grow up and become expert birds we send them off to fly over Vienna. One day the people of Vienna look up and they see a sky full of flying soldiers. Our birds ignite the gun powder barrels they carry with them and... ...drop them on the enemy. Then they fly back to get more ammunition and once more return to the Vienna Skies. Stop! Let me take a breath! So, why couldn't you fly yet? We are still experimenting. I see. Is there anything you need? There is, my lord. We have some ancient scripts which we can't decipher. These papers belong to a Venetian slave. We would like to find her. Who and where is she now? We don't know, my lord. She is almost dead. Come, let's take away this table. I won't give up my room. Who wants you to? Get up! I'm on top of a bald mountain. A flock of birds with bright red feathers are singing me... ...to sleep with songs lovelier that the nightingale's trill. Meanwhile, inside the mountain a worm, how shall I describe it... resembling the worms that gnaw at apples, but of giant size... ...is gnawing away at the rocks. While I am lost in sleep that whit, slimy fat worm comes out of the mountain peak... ...and opens it's mouth to swallow me. At that moment the beautiful birds songs die... ...and the red birds are changed into a flock rooks... ...mocking me with their cawing. Time and time again, I woke up just as I was about to be swallowed by the worm. Chief Astrologer, what do you think this dream portends? It does not bring pleasant things to mind, my lord. Nevertheless, there must be a lesson that can be learned from it. Come to the point! The important thing is to find out what the dream portends and to take the precaution. Those pretty red birds... ...must represent the Devil, my Sultan. The cawing of the rooks, following your being tricked to sleep... ...must be the Devil's laughter. Is your opinion the same? I agree with the Chief Astrologer, my lord. The mountain in your dream must be our Ottoman Empire. The giant worm must represent the traitors... ...who want to destroy our empire from within. Conspiring with the infidel, the Devil tried to charm you to sleep. But... ...you have much a might and... ...that you open your eyes in time to prevent... ...the destruction of yourself and your empire. Yes, my Sultan. It is not a good dream. But it is good that you've dreamed it. The angels have sent you this dream to warm you... ...that the Devil will be tempting you in a charming guise. Otherwise he is already attempting to deceive you with his guiles. There we are. Drink this too. Good for you. Your fever has started to go down. You, in a one corner of the world... ...and me, in another corner. We have been involved in the same thing. Strange! But then, why should it be strange? How beautiful! Big Brother! Master Antonio has arrived. Come in, I am in here. Is she mute? Heavens! She is mute. For almost 2 months now you have been treating a mute slave! She is a human being even if so. Should I have left her to die? "I wish he had left me to die. It is better to die that to live as a Turk's slave. If she does not want to be my slave... ...she should tell me at once what these papers are about. Then she can go where she pleases. I have no wish to keep a slave. The script and these sketches are prepared by a man of Vinci called Leonardo. But since the script is in cipher nobody can read it. I don't believe her. She will remain my slave until we solve the mystery of these papers. Did you tell you? Yes. Big brother where shall I put these? Big brother! Leave then there. I'll see to them later. Do her wounds have scabs? Yes, they do. In bunches like a honeycomb? Any red blotches under the skin? You talk as you saw her. Checkmate! My lord, by your leave, I'll give Ahmet Chelebi the ointments. Of course, go ahead. We can carry on afterwards. The lessons seem to be eresipel. It is the bubonic plague! My lord, do you remember your nightmare of last night? This is the worm that was eating away at your kingdom... ...and trying to swallow you in your dream: The plague! The Devil is among us in the guise of the bubonic plague. My lord, don't be deceived by the song of those pretty red birds. Beware of Hezarfen, my lord. The plague is at our door! What is this nonsense?! Hasan, do you see how much she's improved these days! You've really gone mad. Stop wasting your time with this mute slave. We have our work to do. This is also a part of our work, Hasan. The papers of Leonardo are very important for us. Why can't you understand this? Judging from his sketches, he also had the idea of flying with wings. Those drawings! I've been against this idea from the very start. I don't believe that man can fly like the birds. You may not. But I will try it. Leonardo's wing drawings hold a great interest for me. You might want to do other things by yourself. I will do other things and leave you to your dumb slave girl! I can't wait for her tongue to loosen for ever. When you see me flying up to the sky, your mouth will fall open with wonder! Hey, big brother, let's go to Karagöz. Come, let's go. Not that way. Girls are this way. He says that I can't fly with wings and that there is no other way to do it. Alright then, how will you fly? This is it! This is it! This is the way! Damn it! Damn it! Don't dead people get frightened in the grave? Where do you get these weird ideas, Leyla? I would be frightened. Then we won't bury you in the grave. Can you give me that one? When I die, don't bury me in the grave! What do you think about of this? This won't work. Come. Here! This is soap. Make suds out of it by water, like this. Scrub yourself with this cloth, pouring also hot water like this. Do you understand? Take this dress and put it on you. How are you different from us? In what way? May be Lagari is right. Maybe it is better to give up this dream. We humans are made one way and you creatures, another way. For instance, you hatch from egg. As for us... The breasts! The breasts! The breasts! Calm down! Come here! Come here! The breasts! Yes, the breasts! The breasts! Yes, the breasts! The breasts! The breasts! The breasts! The breasts! The breasts! The breasts! The breasts! Do you know bats? The bat is a bird. It can fly. But what sort of a bird is the bat? How would you know? The bat is a mammal! Yes, a mammal. I too am a mammal! Look, I have breasts too, Eleni! Then tell me why the bat can fly and I can not. Fly away, my handsome! The sky is all yours! Fly! Well done, Eleni. Let's fly. I am flying! I am flying! You nameless slave! By the way what is your name? My name is Ahmet. Look, this is quilt. This is bed. I'm Ahmet. Understood? Here. I'm Ahmet. You? What is this? Read it. Francesca da Roma! Francesca da Roma! Francesca from Rome! Poor Francesca the slave! So, Francesca of Roma... ...would rather be dead that a Turk's slave, would she? You are absolutely right. I too would rather die... ...than be someone's slave. I hereby... ...grant Roman slave woman Francesca... ...he freedom. Signed: Ahmet. Here, take this. You don't understand, do you? This is your freedom certification, girl! You are no longer a slave. You are as free as a bird! So fly away! Francesca! The certificate! Where is it? I have done it! What is it that you've done? With God's and your blessings... ...I desire to fly to the moon with this heavenly invention of mine. To the moon? Yes, my lord. What is this lunatic saying? What do you say, Ahmet? Don't give your permission, my lord! Go ahead and fly, you lunatic! My lord Sultan... ...I leave you with God. I'm off to converse with the Lord Jesus! Ignition! Higher! Higher! Fly up! This is what I feared, my lord! You bloody, gun powder! Do you see? Your fears were groundless. Hold on, my friend, I'm coming to help you! My Sultan, I bring you greetings from the Lord Jesus! I don't know what do to with you, Hasan. Look at you now! What of it? Haven't I flown? Next time around, I will reach the moon! I very much doubt it, Hasan. You have ended down in the sea instead of the moon! If we combine our own knowledge and experience with those of Leonardo... ...we might really make a scientific breakthrough. Get the paper. Damn it! Birds resemble vehicle that work by mathematical principles. Man is capable of imitating all the movements of birds. Unfortunately man's power is not proportionate to his capabilities. With his intelligence and using a mechanism enabling... ...him to make up for his lack of capabilities... ...man can defeat the force of gravity and soar in the sky. Therefore in that the only thing... ...lacking in such a man made instrument... ...would be the life force that the bird possesses. Man will provide these wings with the required life force. This life force is spread throughout the body of the bird... ...and no doubt, the Creator had designed this to meet the requirements of the bird. Man's creation can't be superior to God's as his wings weren't created naturally. The execution of the subtle movements that... ...create balance will be especially difficult for Man. I have seen and closely studied various bird movements. The human mind can grasp only the rough ones of these movements. And his mind will find the way to preserve this instrument... ...and to keep his balance so he can keep his life. Winged Man, just like the eagle, will become the conqueror of the skies. When Man first flies with bird wings, the whole world will be awed. His name will become legend and his home a nest of victory forever. No! Leyla? What? What is happening? Yes, Chief of Islam. My sovereign Sultan! Hezarfen will attempt to fly tomorrow in front of all the people of Istanbul... ...with your gracious permission. Suppose he succeeds to fly! Did you think about that? Suppose he does! What of it? My lord! I have been trying to warn you about this turn of events. Now, if this man flies and you do not... ...what will the people think? They will think you are the lesser man. Remember, when Lagari rose to the sky, how awed the people were! Men like these can easily influence the public! God forbit, they might eclipse your power. One can't stop the legends. Once the people start to talk, your very throne might become shaky. If this man flies... ...he will have done... ...what no mortal man has been able to do before. The people might idolize him. Stone the devil worshippers! Stone the devil worshippers! Stone the devil worshippers! Come! There they are. Escaping! Let's get and burn them! What's up? What are you looking for? We are looking for 2 fugitives, have you seen anyone? I see here nothing but the fish. Get out of my garden! Have you found them yet? No. Search the back street. What's going on, Evliya? Have these men gone mad? Sultan's forbidden you to fly. They will kill you. Give it up. Give up! Giving up my dream would kill me. No, Francesca. It is now or never! Who is that man? What is he doing?! I'm flying! I'm flying! Hey, Istanbul! Now you lie beneath my wings! Good for you, Hezarfen Ahmet Chelebi. Now only have you become the first man to fly... ...you have the honor of being the first man to fly from one continent to another. Well done! Where are you taking them? What is happening? Big brother! Look at me. Men like you should be feared... ...as you accomplish whatever you set your heart on. The existence of men like you should not be tolerated. Big brother! Ahmet! Let me go! Passing away, we left the world behind... ...leaving untouched thousands of pearls we had. Because of the senseless ignorance, many a colorful thought were unsaid. Hezarfen Ahmet Chelebi: He was exiled to Algiers and never heard from again. Some says he was killed before he could reach Algiers. But, there are also those who maintain to have seen his grave there. However, it is certain fact that the scientist Hazarfen is permenantly... ...established in his special niche in the history of human progress. Lagari Hasan Chelebi: He survived to live on in Crimea. It is believed that the earliest astronomical studies in the world originated in the Ukraine. Who can say it was not Lagari, with his dedication and celestial rocket... ...who inspired and shaped those studies? Bekri Mustafa: While men of Istanbul visit this sage's tomb to toast life and love... ...with a drink, ironically, wives light candles there... ...offering prayers that their husbands may be cured of drink. Evliya Çelebi: Probably the first and certainly the most engaging of chronicler... ...Journalists, Evliya, with his nimble pen, described for us the day by day... ...panorama of the people and events of his time. Murat The Fourth: Famed for his bodily strength and... ...bravery, Sultan Murat who banned the... ...consumption of opium, tobacco and alcohol in the empire... ...himself died of cirrhosis of the liver at the age 27. They were always there, as they are still here. Unfortunately they will always be with us. But humanity soon forgets their nabes; it always has and it always will.
