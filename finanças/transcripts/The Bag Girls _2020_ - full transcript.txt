Yes. 234725 Wildbrook Lane, Miami, Florida, 33036. Yes. And when did that happen? Okay. Okay thank you. - He canceled the card. Didn't he? - Girl yeah. (soothing music) - So listen, when we get inside we taking all the shit, putting them in garbage bags, and putting them on the curb. - Period. - You know how to change locks? - No, do you? - Oh yeah. Home Depot's up the road. - Okay. - We go there before he get off. We gotta hurry. We gotta be quick though. - That's weird. I don't usually use the front door anyway. We can go around the back to the patio, see if I can get in through there. I know he didn't change the locks on me. - Throw that shit. - Deandrea, stop with this nonsense, girl. - Wait a minute. Yeah. Is this bitch recording you? - Walter why are you doing this to me? - Look Dee. Baby look it's over. Look, text me a address where I can send your things. - [Mistress] And the divorce papers. - Do that bitch got my robe on? - Come on, come on. You deserve way better than this piece of shit. And you got a good lawyer. You'll be all right. Don't worry about it. And when I see this bitch on the street it's on. - [Dee] That bitch had my robe on. - [Nola] Come on. - Here take it. I don't want it anyway. It's too big for me. - [Dee] I'll kill this hoe. - Come on Dee. Come on Dee. Get the fuck out of here, fuck nigga. - Well Mrs. Smith. We're gonna have a job on our hands dividing up the assets in your divorce proceedings. - Well I don't understand. Everything was in both of our names, the house, the business, everything. - Well, Ms. Smith, I went through all of the documents that you told me to go through, and apparently you relinquished your rights to the ownership of the business. And you also did a quick claim deed that put your home into a business called "Hightower Holdings LLC." Do you recall doing this over a year ago? - I mean, Walter gave me papers to sign all the time, but I don't remember seeing anything about relinquishing my partnership to the business or signing over the deed to the house. - You didn't read all of the documents your husband had you to sign? - [Dee] I didn't think I had to. - Well apparently he's been planning this for over a year. (dramatic music) Look Mrs. Smith, you said you caught him in the bed with another woman. - I did. - He kicked you out the house. He moved his mistress in. And he mailed your clothes to you. - Yeah. - You don't have to worry about a retainer's fee. He'll eventually pay it. My team and I we will definitely dig deep and make sure we go through all of his assets, even the ones he has hidden. You will get what you're deserved. I guarantee you that. I can't stand a lying, cheating man. - Thank you so much. No, no, no wait, wait, wait. What are you doing? This is my car. - Hey, wait clearly it's the banks. You done missed five payments. - Impossible, that's impossible. - I mean, you owe. I repo. (engine starts) - Hello Nola. Can you come pick me up from the lawyer's office? Well yeah. Apparently my car just got repoed. Okay. How do I work an uber? (dog barks) Man remember back in high school we used to fuck with them east coast jack boys, Tommy and Sincere? - How can I forget? They had us setting up old white men tourists on South Beach chasing some hot ass. - Man whatever happened to them? - Last time I checked Sincere got killed. And Tommy, ain't nobody heard from him since. - Man that's fucked up. But we grew up. I went to college, met the man of my dreams got married. I been living a real good life since then. - Till now. - Right, up until now. Man my husband keeps a lot of money in that safe downtown in his office. - Oh yeah, what's a lot of money? - Like 50K. Yeah he kept it for emergencies, just in case something happened. - A $50,000 emergency cash fund, what are y'all doing? - Shit I'm broke now. Car repossessed, and I need some money to hold me over for a little while. - That's fucked up. So you thinking about running up in there and go get some cash? - Shit we used to do it back in the day with them old white men. Why we can't do it now? I mean, it's a 24 hour security guard that carries a club, a cleaning crew that's there every night. Walter works late on Wednesdays. We need to go in there on Wednesday night. He the only one that got the combination to the safe though. - [Nola] But are you sure you wanna do this? - [Dee] Yeah I'm sure I wanna do this. - [Nola] And besides my little sister could sure use the extra cash. - Crystal. Ain't she real spiritual? You sure she gonna be down for doing something like this? - Oh yeah. When you got an extra mouth to feed and your baby daddy ain't no where to be found, you gotta do what you gotta do. And besides it's hard to find jobs out here. Why you think my ass in the strip club every night? - 'Cause you a hoe. - If I was a hoe, I wouldn't be trying to do this shit with your ass. But besides this money could put me back in school. - You know what my cousin Daisy she a real bad bitch. We need to call her. She always down to hit a lick. - Daisy, that crazy bitch Daisy? - Ever since we was little Daisy was the baddest bitch. - So we splitting four ways? - [Dee] We splitting four ways. - Let's do it. - All right, so I got us the same uniforms that the cleaning crew wear in the building so we can blend in with the scenery. - So how we still supposed to get in? - I mean I still got my keys to the building. But Walter probably changed his locks by now. But he can't change the locks to the building. So we can go in through the back. - But if the office locked, how the fuck we gonna get in? - Now that's when shit get tricky. They got a security guard that got a master key. That key open up every office in the building. If we get that key from him, we in the office and we at that safe. - Where'd you get that gun? - Relax sis. It's my pistol. - But why do you have a gun? - I'm a stripper. I mean, you know niggas be acting crazy after the club, wanna be stalking bitches and shit. So I gotta stay strapped. - I don't think I can do this. You said this was gonna be easy. You didn't say nothing about somebody getting hurt. - Nobody's getting hurt. It's just for convincing. - Convincing? What does that even mean? - Look I ain't a dancer, but I'm a gangster. But you know I stay with my shit on me. - Nope, nope. I can't do this. Y'all got too many guns on the table, and I don't like guns, and I want nothing to do with them. - Crystal relax. I mean, this is $12,500 a piece on the line. And all we gotta do is worry about some fucking fat ass security guard, and we're doing all the heavy lifting. All you gotta do is watch out. And I know your baby needs some new clothes right now. Yeah it's a struggle to keep food in your refrigerator and keep a roof over your head. So sit the fuck down, and stop acting like a baby. (upbeat music) (man screams) - [Dee] Place that motherfucker up here. (upbeat music) - Fuck this shit. - Wait, no gun. - [Daisy] Get this fat motherfucker off me. Bitch. (upbeat music) - Look from here on out, we wear our mask. We cannot risk Walter seeing our faces. - What the fuck you think this is, "Set it Off" Part II? - Bitch this ain't no motherfucking movie. You trying to get to this bag or not? - Let's get the bag. (upbeat music) - Hey what's up baby? Yeah I'm just finishing up here at the office. Hey I was thinking Chinese tonight. What do you think about that? Chinese it is. Hey do me a favor, give 'em a call, and let 'em know I'll be about 10, 15 minutes, and I'll come pick it up. All right, can't wait to see you. Love you, bye. (woman screams) What the fuck? - [Dee] Go, go. - What the hell is this about? - Open the door. - Open the door. - [Dee] Get the fuck in there right now. - What is this about? All right, hold on, okay. All right, all right. Look, I have $300 in my wallet. I have a watch, right, and I have a cell phone. Just take it, take it all and leave please. What is going on? - [Nola] We didn't come here for no damn watch or a cellphone. Where the safe at? - Safe, what safe? This is my office, my first floor office. - This safe motherfucker. - [Walter] There's nothing in there. Whoever gave you your information mislead you clearly. You know I never trust you fucking cleaning ladies. All of y'all look like convicts. - [Daisy] Man shut the fuck up. We ain't got no time for that shit. Where's the fucking key? - [Walter] I don't have a key. - [Crystal] Look y'all, come on let's go. He said there's nothing in there, so let's roll. - [Dee] Man fuck that. Hold that motherfucker down. - [Walter] Wait. - Where the fuck is the key? - What are you doing? Hold on. What key? I don't have a key. - [Daisy] Oh yeah, he gonna talk now. - [Dee] I said where the fuck is the key. - All right, all right, okay. It's right here, right here. Key. - Hold him. - I'm sorry. - [Dee] And if that motherfucker move, burn his dick off. - [Nola] Come on, we gotta go now. - All right, take it. - Not without this Roley. - Take it. - [Daisy] Shit, put your hands down nigga. - [Dee] Give me that. - What, wait, hold on. (Walter screams) Hold on. - Let's go. (upbeat music) All right ladies, don't spend it all in one spot. - I'm a get rid of these jumpsuits. - We probably should just burn 'em. - No, I'm taking these back to Carol. I'm gonna put 'em in the dumpster. Four bums gonna be wearing these bitches tomorrow. (women laugh) - Hey y'all my shoulder is aching. I'm about to go soak in the tub. Holler at y'all bitches tomorrow. - All right sis. - All right remember. Speak of this to no one. - All right. (upbeat music) - So what you think about the place? - I love it. I knew you'd pick up on my taste sooner or later. - I'm pretty sure I can pick up on a few things if you'd let me. However when you're ready to put this offer in. - Hold on now. Slow down. You're moving a little too fast. - I mean they got everything you want, 700 square feet, looking at this beautiful view, one bedroom, one bath. This look like something you used to. Where you stay at now? - Well my... I'm looking for bigger and better. I just got a new business opportunity. So I'm just looking for new. - Well you know what they say when it comes to opportunity. You better let it through the front door. - Or you can bust that motherfucker through the back window. (Dee and man laugh) - You crazy. - You know what I want it. And I'm not financing. I'm paying in all cash. - Oh your bag like that? - What y'all looking at? Dumb asses. - All right class dismissed. I'll see y'all tomorrow. I'll see y'all tomorrow. (faintly speaking) Ms. Gray can I talk to you for a minute? - [Nola] Yeah, what's the problem? - Who said it was a problem? - [Nola] Those two. - Listen don't worry about them, okay, 'cause they a bunch of jackasses. Just wanted to make sure if you need any extra class help or after class tutoring I'm available to you. - To be honest, I haven't been to school in a while, and these classes are a lot harder than I expected. So Professor Jackson I might just have to take you up on that extra tutoring. - All right thank you. I like that. - So is there a link on the website where I can sign up for? - Actually I was thinking that we don't really have to go through the school to do it. See what I'm offering you is private tutoring, more one-on-one. See I wanna make sure you get all my lessons in a more slowed-down pace and more of a relaxed setting. - Right, well it sounds good. - All right. So listen hey, take my card and thinking maybe some time next week. We can go ahead and get those classes started. - Maybe. - See you then. - Bye. - All right, bye bye. - You heard from that lawyer lately. Last time I talked to her she was still going through Walter's finances. He is doing a good ass job of hiding his assets. How's school been going? - You know I've been grinding through it. I've been actually getting some extra tutoring from this one professor. And it's been a slow process, but I'm starting to catch up. - Tutoring. What he look like? - Girl, he is so fine, tall, handsome, smart, my type. - Okay, okay I see you. Going for the professional type nowadays, okay. - But no really, he's actually really helping me with extra tutoring. We meet up at the coffee shop. And we also met up at the park one time. And girl he had these gray sweat shorts on, and I was like the print was real. - Okay, and. - Listen he was once reading me my assignment up on that bench. He opened up his legs, placed his elbows on his knees. - [Dee] And then what? - Shifted over to the left and his whole dick fell out. - Bitch, his whole dick fell out. - Whole fucking dick. - And you ain't tell him? - Girl no, that thing was looking fucking thick and juicy. - So what did he say when you saw it? - Excuse me Ms. Drake I didn't mean for that to happen. But girls my eyes seen what it saw and fuck the books. - Nola you a mess. - So how you liking your new place? - I like it. I love it actually. Girl the real estate agent who helped me find it was fine as hell, and I'm going on a date with him later. - So you looking at new jobs? - Like you said before, ain't no damn jobs out here. I got a whole bachelor's degree, and the best that I can find right now is a temporary assistant job, being a secretary. - I mean, girl, you can always get your dance license and come shake that ass with me. I mean, you thick enough. - I ain't ready for all that yet. How you still doing money-wise since that one thing? - I mean, after paying up a couple classes and paying bills, what money? - Girl I feel you. Shit I wouldn't mind hitting another lick. - Bigger than that one, shit.

I'm trying to enjoy a drink. I'm paying for it. - What the fuck does that mean? If you don't make no money, I don't make no money. Now you need to get your ass out there and make some of these motherfucking lap dances. - Vinny what do you want? Ain't nobody got time for you. - Time for me.

I don't even see it. - I put it in under the Redman's brother's file. - First it should be under the Redman construction folder, not the Redman brother's file. And second, I don't even see it in the wrong folder. Did you even do what I asked you to do? - I'm sure I put it in there. - How 'bout this? Just go back to your little desk, find it, email it to me, and I'll take care of it from here. - Okay, we'll do. - Yep. - Fucking temp. Fuck I hire you for? (upbeat music) (loud typing) (phone ringing) - [Temp Boss] Where the fuck she going? - Listen, so y'all know this Saturday is rapper T Villa's birthday party, right? - [Daisy] I like his shit, and... - And the bar makes about 150,000 or more that night. - Okay, so what does that have to do with us? - So how much money do you got left after that Walter situation? - None. - I mean, my bills is paid up for a while, and once I get a decent job I'll be all right. - So don't you think if you hit a big lick like this your bills a be paid up and you wouldn't have to worry about anything, possibly invest or something? What you think? - Shit, I think that sounds good. - [Daisy] Me too. - Exactly. We can rob the bar. - I think we taking this a little too far now. I mean, Walter was a bad person, and we got away the first time. But now y'all wanna rob a bar, a business establishment? I don't know about that. I don't think I want that kinda karma on me and my baby. I might not be able to do this one. - So you think Vinny is a good person. He has harassed every woman in that bar, pressuring them to have sex with him. And he's even harassed me on countless occasions. - Wait, wait are you serious? So did he hurt you sis? - No, but he tried. Fuck Vinny and that bar. Let's get that bag. I know his whole routine and the layout of that bar. - Shit, for a 150 grand I'm down. - And you know I don't need much convincing. I'm in. - [Dee] Crystal? - I mean, he tried to hurt my sister. And he's made other women sell their bodies, so I'm in. - Hey, I like what you called us in the group text, "the bag girls." - Yeah The Bag Girls, that's dope. - It's nice. - Yeah, The Bag Girls, but listen ladies. We gotta come up with a couple code names before we go in that building. Y'all cannot make a mistake and call me "Nola" or my ass is dead. - Look I know what we can do. We can call each other code names like colors, like Ms. Pink, Ms. Yellow, like they did in "Reservoir Dogs," the Quentin Tarantino movie. - Fuck Quentin Tarantino. - You know what I got it. We call ourselves the Bag Girls right. Why don't we just name ourselves after designer bags? - All right. - I like that idea. - Well y'all can call me "Ms. Gucci." - Yeah that figures. - Well if you Ms. Gucci, I'm definitely Ms. Louie. - I could see that. I could see that. - Okay, okay, okay, it's my turn. I'm Ms. Fendi. - All right now Ms. Fendi bag. I see you, girl. - Hold up. All you bitches got top designer names. What I'm supposed to be called? - Hold on cuz, I got the perfect name for you. See, the name that match your personality is Ms. Coach. (women laugh) You know you love a good coach bag. - Look y'all think y'all funny. I fucks with coach, and I got a coach bag on me right now. - Man I'm just gassing you cuz. I got the perfect name for you, Ms. Chanel. - Okay I could see that. I like that. Shit but on the real though, we gotta grab some more of those cleaner jumpsuits. I been got rid of the old ones. - No, I'll get us some fly ass shit that'll spook Vinny and those bouncers too. - Bouncers, wait what we gonna do about them? Do they carry guns? - From what my boy Reggie told me, the bartender, is that they keep a 12 gauge in Vinny's office to walk him to the car. But other than that there's no guns allowed in that club. - [Daisy] Bouncers too? - Bouncers too. - How many bouncers we talking about here? - So if we strike at the right time, we're only dealing with four bouncers, and on my way out I could unlock that emergency dancer door upstairs. - [Daisy] We might need a little more steel to get everybody to cooperate. Two pistols ain't gonna get the job done this time. - Right. And I got the right person to call for that. (soothing music) - Hey man where your people at, 'cause these niggas looking real serious? - Relax, we good. - Bro I see you staring all hard. I just wanna let you know you ain't the only one strapped in this bitch. Oh you think I'm fucking playing. - Jesus save us. - No ain't no white Jesus coming to save you. - Jake is that you? - At ease man, at ease. (soothing music) (faintly speaking) - Scared as fuck. Your goons had us shook out here. - Ain't nobody shook. - You gonna come here and give me a hug damn, you acting like that girl. Introduce me to your girls. - So this is Dee. I mean, this is Ms. Gucci. This is Ms. Fendi. And that little hot head over there, Ms. Chanel. - Okay, that's what's up. Well I go by the name of Jake, all right. I'll be the middle name to y'all and any street shit that y'all might need, you dig? I heard y'all looking for some heat. - Right. - Can you explain to us what each one of these do? - Of course I can. Now this right here is some nice little 45, you dig, standard weapon, nothing crazy. But now you got the AK-47. Now this baby originated in Russia, used by the Soviet Union. Then adopted by your average American gang banger, used for shootouts, drive-by's, simple shit like that. But I guarantee you it'll put a hole in a motherfucker real quick. AR-15, America's most beloved and hated weapon. Now this thing has been used all over the world to invade other countries and create war and shit like that. Then adopted by your average American white boy who felt some type of way because their supervisor passed them up for promotion. Mowing down on cheerleaders and shit like that for calling him a fat geek back in 11th grade biology. This baby, double barrel 12-gauge shotgun. Now it's the cheapest of the group, but it's the most reliable. - That bitch look old as a motherfucker, but if it's cheap and it's the most reliable, we gonna take that for sure. - And it won't jam on you, easy to conceal. Plus you got multiple ammo options for it. Personally, I like the buckshot slugs. - What are buckshot slugs? - Well the buckshot slug is when you put the buckshot in the first pipe, clear the area out, put the slug in the second pipe to put a hole in a nigga ass if he don't comply, guaranteeing that the next nigga won't make the same mistake. - So how much you gonna charge for all this? - [Jake] Shit you want ammo with it too? - Hell yeah. - Normally I charge 2,500, but for you 21 is cool. And I throw in some ammo for you for free. - Sounds like a deal to me. - All right bet. Let's rack it up. We can go in the back, and I can show you how to use this shit. Cool? - Cool. - All right, let's do it.

(hip hop music) Damn daddy why you stop tipping? - What the fuck? This is fucked up. - Why the fuck is the music still playing? Why's the stripper still in there man? - I think he out there trying to bang something boss. - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah I used to be like that too, man, trying to fuck. But hey man, get them up outta here. Man we gotta get this bag up outta here. Bank get this deposit. - Let's go baby. - You got me. - Come on. - Take the rest of that. Oh shit shoot. (gun fires) (women scream) (shots fire) (shots fire) - [Crystal] Oh we gonna die. - [Nola] Calm the fuck down. Ms. Fendi shut up. - [Crystal] That's not my name. Don't call me that. - [Nola] Vinny just ran out the back door with the money. Go pull the car right now to the garage. Go get the fucking car right now. Go get the car now. - Okay. (gun fires) (suspenseful music) (gun fires) - [Nola] Get the fuck down. Give me the bag. - [Crystal] No. Motherfucker. (ominous, dramatic music) What the fuck? - Fucking right, that shit was livest shit I seen in my fucking life. Bag Girls, who want it? Who next? - I need a drink. Who want one? - [Nola] Shit me, that shit was crazy. - Me too, and I don't want none of that weak ass wine shit. I want some hard fucking liquor. - [Nola] Crystal come on. Come have a drink with us. - No, I'm done. - [Dee] What you mean you're done? I ain't even poor nothing yet. - No I'm done. I'm done with all this with y'all. I can't live like this. I can't do this with y'all anymore, man. I just can't. I mean, we were just in a shootout. And we were the bad guys. And then I see this nigga pointing a pistol at my sister and pull the trigger. And she shot him. - [Nola] That shit was gangsta. - [Daisy] No it wasn't. That shit was insane. Nola, I love y'all too, but I can't do this anymore. - Well sis, let me talk to you. You're our good luck charm. Now out of all of us, you were the only one that done right our whole life. If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't even be alive tonight. And when Vinny pulled that pistol out on me I was gone, but the only reason why I wasn't, because you screamed out "no" and that nigga flinched. And that's the only reason why he missed. But you know what was crazy when you ran up in that building and cracked that security guard in the head with that stick that shit was epic. We need you. - I know sis, but I'm sorry I just can't do it anymore. - I respect that. But listen you still want your cut though? - Hell yeah. (upbeat music) - [Nola] Eat up bitches. - $187,000. Not bad for one night's work ladies. - Shit I can't believe I'm about to take homoe 47,000 in cash. - Nice. Real nice. (soothing music) - Hop in nigga. - What's up Nard? You got that. - Here you go. Copping your first big. You moving up out here in the streets. - Look when I go through this eight I'm a holler at you for the rest of this brick. - Hey I ain't gotta count this, do I? - Nigga do whatever the fuck you want. You know where I be at. - Old raggedy bitch. Think she all that, because she got on a new outfit. I remember her whole family used to smell like pee. That's crazy as a motherfucker. - Ms. Drake I gotta say. This right here is a real unexpected surprise. - Call me Nola from here on out Professor Jackson. I appreciated your help so much, from free tutoring and everything that you've done for me. So I figured that this is the least that I can do to show you my appreciation. - Well thank you Nola. And from here on out just call me Damon. - Okay Damon. - Well listen, I gotta be honest. This whole tutoring thing I had some ulterior motives behind it, and right now I'm just kinda wanting to get to know you more on a personal level. So why don't you tell me how you feel about that? - My question to you is Damon wanna fuck? - Waiter check please. ♪ Illuminati please ♪ ♪ You ain't talking about no money nigga fuck on ♪ ♪ This pussy here exclusive ♪ ♪ Not some shit that you just fuck on ♪ ♪ Hell no I don't kiss ♪ ♪ Give me your face that's what I bust on ♪ ♪ Five star mil made eat him eat it with the bust on ♪ ♪ Now he mad 'cause I ain't ask ♪ ♪ Ain't no cuss on ♪ ♪ Got this nigga spring cleaning ♪ ♪ In the winter playing love songs ♪ ♪ I smack my lips like what's wrong ♪ ♪ He say girl you ain't right ♪ ♪ Boy I fucked you one time ♪ ♪ You mad because you came twice ♪ ♪ See what this pussy game like ♪ ♪ You mad because you can't wife ♪ ♪ Tell me what you like ♪ ♪ And I'm a tell you what ain't like ♪ ♪ Call the shots I hold the money drive the cars ♪ ♪ What you lay like ♪ ♪ Big boss shit ♪ ♪ Your bitch can't see me in the daylight ♪ ♪ I lay the ruse you lay pipe ♪ ♪ So now you know your place right ♪ ♪ And I ain't got beef with bro codes ♪ ♪ That's just play fight ♪ ♪ Got a hood nigga hit the road ♪ ♪ He don't take flights ♪ ♪ And he give me that chicken hold he don't take bites ♪ (banging on door) - Please Todd just leave us alone.

And I couldn't help myself. - And Jake said take the money, not the dope. What are we gonna do with all this? - Sell it. Shit, y'all might not be drug dealers, but I am. And with this much dope, shit, I could be like Griselda Blanco, the cocaine godmother. - Bitch are you crazy? - Oh so y'all talking about the cocaine black widow. That bitch is dead. And everybody that fucked with her is dead too. Do you want that to be us? - Wait, so it's okay if we rob the black man, the brothers. But as soon as we hit a lick on some white motherfuckers, then y'all get scared. Man fuck them foreign motherfuckers. I'm all about a dollar. What the fuck is 50 cent? - Daisy what the fuck are you talking about? - I'm talking about I saw an opportunity to get the whole thing, not half.

What do you think the price is to make us whole for that? - Man, we ain't shoot nobody. - You're a good liar. - Hey Cheva.

That's the only reason why I could think that something like this would happen. You know if my friend Crystal is okay? - Have to check with the doc on that one. - Your friend is very lucky you got her here when you did. She lost a lot of blood, but she should be okay. She's regained consciousness, and you can see her in about an hour. - Thank you so much doc. Do you know if my other friend is okay? - Which one? It was a car full of gunshot victims, right. - Nola Drake, is she okay? - Yes Ms. Drake will be fine. We're just starting to prep her for surgery. - Thank God. - I'll be back in a little while with an update. - Thanks doc. - All right. Can you describe for me the make, model, color or year of the vehicle the shooters were in? - Look I'm a be honest. I ain't see shit. I was high as hell. My head was back with my eyes closed. I was just enjoying the weather. All of a sudden I hear gunshots. So I ducked to the floor. When I picked my head up and the shots stopped, I realized my friends was hit. I got grazed in the shoulder, and we came straight here. - Wait. So you're telling me you didn't see the vehicle at all? - No. I was just driving. Next thing I know this car pulled up on the side of us. I seen these lights start flashing on the side of my eye. Then I heard the bullets ricocheting off of the car. I put my head down. I put my foot on the peddle, and I just pressed as hard as I could, and I just drove. By the time I looked up I saw my girls was hit. And I brought us straight here. - How'd you get that bloody nose? - I must've pulled my head down so fast I hit my nose on the steering wheel. - So were they black, Latin, or white dudes who were doing the shooting? - Who said it was dudes? - Who said it wasn't? - Look lady, I told you I ain't see shit. - I know. I know. Your eyes were closed, right? - That's what I said. - Right, right. Hey Heard. - Is there anything you can tell me, any reason at all why you think somebody would wanna do this to you or your girls? - I don't know, man, jealousy, envy. People always want something that ain't theirs. - Yeah I know. It's sad. Isn't it? - Yeah, real sad. - Well here's my card. I'm Detective Heard. Give me a call if you remember anything at all. Okay? - All right thank you. (upbeat music) The vault only opens up one time a day. And that's in three minutes. Daisy and Crystal y'all take the two security guards. - Got it. - We wanna get in and out. So if anybody in there try to play hero, what do we do? - We lay 'em the fuck down. - Listen, Dee and I gotta go in the vault, okay. We can't waste any time at the tellers. All y'all gotta do is watch out for the security and the people. Understood? - Yeah, understand. - [Dee] Good. - Ladies, y'all ready? Let's do this.
