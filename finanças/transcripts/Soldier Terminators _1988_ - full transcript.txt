(film reel clicking) (dramatic music) (exciting rock music) (whistling) (ominous beat music) (whistling bird call) (whistling) (ominous beat music) (exciting beat music) (bombs booming) (rumbling) (menacing music) (ominous drumming music) (slicing) (exciting music) (groaning) (groaning) (grunting) (thudding) Okay, that's enough! Very impressive. Yeah but he's the better half. You're too kind but I agree. (chuckling) Very well done, guys. Right. And, as always, you just watched instead of joining in the fun. I'm saving my energy for something bigger. What is it this time, Tom? I suppose you two know about the New People's Freedom Army in the South Pacific. Yeah? So? Well, I'm sure you know they're supposed to be fighting against communism. Yeah, just what we want. Right. You never know about these groups. They can be against something today then, when they get some power, they become like the enemy they once fought. So what's our mission? We wanna stabilize the situation. Keep an eye on them. Make sure they don't fly off in the wrong direction. How are you gonna do that? By getting someone to infiltrate them. Who have you picked? Alexander Samson. Good choice. Alexander doesn't know about it yet, so I want you two to let him know about it. No problem. You know where to find him? Sure. Come on. (ominous music) So what do you say, Alexander? I supposed I'll do it. It's better than just being here trying to keep busy. But one thing I don't know. How do I go inside? It isn't easy. I can't just show up and say I wanna join. That's out of the question. Don't worry, we'll arrange everything. Yeah, we'll spread the word that you were once a revolutionary fighter for a similar cause now living in temporary retirement. They'll buy it. They can always use an experienced fighter. And you'll arrange it? It shouldn't take too long. We'll let you know when you can move. All right, I'll wait here then. Take a good rest, you might need it. (exciting beat music) (upbeat drum music) Hold it! Don't move. (ominous music) Is your name Alexander Samson? And so what if that is my name? What do you want from me? You'll find out! (thudding) You ain't tough. (menacing music) (motor buzzing) (exciting military music) Move! Come on! Move it! Move it! Move! Hurry it up! (men groaning) Move, quickly! (foreboding music) Take your blindfolds off. (groaning) (foreboding music) What's going on? Your guess is as good as mine. (foreboding music) So you're Samson, huh? What's this all about? You're all being trained and I'm your training officer. And you will learn that without my permission you will not speak! (groaning) (thudding) (guns clicking) Get up! All right, let's get moving! All right, move! (ominous beat music) What you're doing is against the law! We'll never consent! You better watch yourself. You're asking for it, Alexander. Now I'm in a good mood, so I'll ignore your outburst. We are the New People's Freedom Army and you are all our new recruits. And... as you know, I'm your training officer. When you graduate, and only then, can you call me by my name, Abdul. Now listen, if you've only known an easy life, well then I'm going to change all that and put your through hell. Burn and you'll come out good soldiers. All of you men, move! (ominous beat music) [Soldier] Come on! Move it! Move! Faster! (thudding) Move it! Come on, you're not trying hard enough! Listen! (groaning) [Soldier] Hurry it up! (thudding) Come on! (groaning) Keep moving. More! (exciting beat music) (gunshots booming) (water sloshing) (exciting beat music) (groaning) Rick! Why'd you do that for? Wanted to. (thudding) (groaning) Hold it! Stop it! Break it up! So what's the problem? Wasn't anything, sir. We were just fooling around. I don't hold anything against him. Suppose it was all my fault. Don't let it happen again. Listen up, you men. We don't fight amongst ourselves. There's a war going on and in order to win this war, we have to stick together, side by side. (exciting beat music) Come on up. (foreboding music) Mark, have you been keeping an eye on the New People's Freedom Army like I told you to? Yes, Commander Victor, I have. Their group has been getting steadily bigger and bigger. We have to get inside the group and gain control over them. I got it made if I can get them to listen to me. Then I can lead my own private army. Except now we're getting competitors. What're you saying, Sanderson? The Americans. They seem to have a high interest in the group too. The Americans, ha! They have an interest in every fucking thing that's going on in the world, don't they? I know but this time they've actually sent a group over here. [Men] Really? [Sanderson] Yes. Then we must get them out of our way. [Sanderson] Right. What's their strength, can you tell me that? From the intelligence report, very small. Good. Since you seem to know the situation, I'll leave the job up to you. I won't disappoint you, Commander. I know you won't. (exciting music) Alexander, the training is over and so now you must help to carry in the cause. I know that you can do it. You men are my best. I know you'll not disappoint me or the Freedom Army. It's a tough road in front of you, so be careful, all right? We'll be victorious. We'll do your training justice by doing our very best. You can be certain of that. And we will not rest until our cause has been victorious. I'm very glad to hear that. I wish you and your men luck. All right, the time has come for you to go. (exciting music) You must be Alexander. Yes I am. It's nice to meet you. I'm Commander Hadjiman. And this Terry. (giggling) Commander Jerry. There's Commander Hamid. And Chico. We're all just like a big family here, so we welcome you. It feels like home. You've all gone through the training? Yes we have. So, where do we go from here? First we go back to our headquarters. We'll plan our next move from there. We're still quite small compared with our enemy's guerrilla army. And we know how to use our strength and no one else knows the location of our camp. That's been good to hear. And what about our fire power? That you don't have to worry about. All of our supplies are more than sufficient. I must agree with Terry. Ammunition is the one thing that you will not have to worry about. We have this situation under control. We have suppliers from places you wouldn't even have heard about. (ominous music) (birds chirping) Yep. Looks like a good place here. We'll set up camp for the night. We're way ahead of schedule. Tomorrow we're gonna meet Alexander at the rendezvous point, all right? Great. In that case, we can all get a good long sleep. - We sure could use one. - Right. (menacing music) (gun clicking) (ominous beat music) Listen up. I think we've got company. Go! (exciting music) (gunshots popping) (gunshots booming) (rapid gunfire popping) (exciting music) (explosion rumbling) (explosion rumbling) (exciting beat music) (rapid gunfire booming) (groaning) (gunshots popping) (moaning) Just give me a chance! (thudding) (rapid popping) Hey, Tom, any idea who they are? I haven't the slightest idea. But I'll contact headquarters, see what they know. Nice to see you again, Hamid. Tell me, how's it going? Fine, thank you, sir. The group has just gotten a new squad of fighters. Interesting. I think it's time now to make our move before the group can get any bigger than it is. I think that you'll agree. You know their location, so you should just go ahead. All right, then. Be careful. Thank you, sir. Lieutenant? Sir. Prepare your men. Tell them the operation is about to commence. Yes, sir. (exciting music) (birds chirping) Thank you very much, Terry. Sure. (somber music) (pleasant beat music) Hello. Huh? Here, have something to drink. Thank you. (pleasant beat music) Getting used to life around here yet? It's not so bad, you think? Yeah? It's not so bad. I'm not here on a vacation. I'm here to fight for a cause just like you are. As long as we stay on the straight path. The cause is all that I have. My family was all killed. I'm sorry. You know, I think they'll be glad to know that you're still fighting. Yeah. I like to think that way. That's what keeps me going. (pleasant beat music) (foreboding music) (tank rumbling) (exciting military music) (booming) (gasping) (suspenseful music) How do they know our location? I don't know! Come on! Go back! (exciting beat music) Fire! (explosions rumbling) Come on! Attack! (rapid gunfire popping) (yelling) (rapid gunfire popping) (fire rumbling) (gunfire commotion) (exciting music) (rapid gunfire popping) (groaning) (exciting beat music) (distant gunfire) Hurry before anyone sees what we're doing! Shit. This guy's got a signal. Hurry up, man! Before they catch us. Then we'll be in deep shit. Come on! Let's go! (rapid gunfire popping) (yelling) (exciting beat music) (rapid gunfire popping) Retreat! (rapid gunfire popping) (groaning) (ominous music) (men grunting and groaning) (dramatic music) Sir, we are lucky, you know, to be alive. Could've been wiped out. You know? Yes, I know. Someone sold us down the river. [Alexander] Sir! (crickets chirping) I'm glad you're safe. Good to know that you're safe. I thought I wouldn't see you again. We were surrounded and had to break through. Very good work, all of you men. How did they find out about our camp? I think someone in our group is not what he seems to be. We have a trader and I think it might be Hamid. Do you really think so? I do. He wasn't among us during the attack today. I think it must be none other than Hamid who sold us to the opposition. I have no doubt that it was him who has become a trader. We gotta find him and question to be sure, though. We could be wrong, after all. Don't you agree, Alexander? He is right. We must find Hamid and bring him back. Right, sir. Alexander, that surprise attack from the army was caused by someone in the group who told the army about your location and we find the trader to be Hamid. Hamid? That bastard. If he's allowed to get away with this, it'll be a great disadvantage to use. I know what to do. And I'll get even with him. You just watch. Good. There's also another group of traders who are interested in the People's Freedom Army. That group's leader is Roman Victor. I think sooner or later he's gonna make his move. So be on the lookout. [Alexander] Right, I will. (pleasant music) Have another beer. Yeah, all right. Drink all you want. It's on me, solider, all right? You drink up. [Soldier] All right. It's a celebration now. (pleasant music) So what do you think? Did we do all right or what, well? - [Soldier] Yeah, all right. - I think we did good. Of course you guys did good. Those idiots were unprepared. [Soldier] Maybe so, but those guys were tough. A lot of them got away. And scared shitless, you think so? Hamid, it was all thanks to you. (chuckling) It's nothing. (pleasant music) (uplifting music) Hamid, it's your lucky day. (uplifting music) So tell me, what's your name? You can just call me Laura. Hi, Laura. Hello. (crickets chirping) I'm glad you're here. I thought you might not show up. But I came just like you asked. I'm so glad you came. I really hoped you would. I have a feeling this will be a special evening for us both. (ocean waves whooshing) (menacing music) Hey, fellas, what're you doing here? I think you know damn well. Laura? (smacking) But why? A lot of my countrymen were killed because of you. Hamid! What do you have to say? Listen. It wasn't my fault. You're making a mistake here. Tell that to the guy way down there in Hell. Tell him your excuses, I'm sure he'd like to listen. [Hamid] No. All right, let's go. Let go of me! I haven't done anything! Please! Let me go! I'm innocent! I haven't done anything, you bastards! Let me go! Let go of me! I haven't done anything, you bastards! Let go of me! (menacing music) I'm innocent! I haven't done anything! (water sloshing) This is something should never have happened. Sir? Lieutenant. Wipe them all out. Yes, sir. (foreboding music) (ominous beat music) (gunshots popping) (rapid gunshots popping) Retreat! (rapid gunshots popping) (explosions rumbling) (explosions rumbling) (rapid gunshots popping) (ominous music) [Soldier] Help me! (groaning) (rapid gunshots popping) (suspenseful music) (ominous beat music) You returned most of my men to safety. Thank you. It wasn't just me. It was by working together that we all got out. You all hear that? A real leader in the making. The moment I laid eyes on you, I knew you were special. So I will make you a commander. You will work along side Commander Jerry, here. Oh. I really don't know what I can say. (chuckling) It won't be an easy job. Thank you very much, sir. Sir, Alexander isn't experienced enough yet. You can't. That's right, sir, he's too new! What about Chico? Enough. I don't wanna hear anymore from you two, is that understood? Yes it is, sir. I'll do my best, you will not be disappointed. I swear to you. You will not regret this decision. Sir, I know Alexander will do a good job and I'll gladly follow. Let's go inside, sir. (ominous music) Hey, buddy, it's unfair. You should be the one. What're you gonna do about it? All right. Well this is it. Yeah. Here? I'm not worried about this American force. We failed one time, so what? It's just a matter of time before we finish them. Yes, Commander. You can just leave them to me. I'll make sure they're taken of. Very well, Mark. Now with that business taken care of, we can turn our attention back to more important things. Sanderson, how about that report? As you probably already know, the People's Freedom Army fought a very good battle against the local army. The local army suffered a great loss in this battle. With their recent victory, the People's Freedom Army also has a new commander. His name is Alexander Sampson. Is that so? What kind of a man is this Alexander Sampson? I couldn't find out anything useful on him. There is practically no background information on him. Still, I gotta check him out. You think you can arrange a meeting for him with me? Well? No problem. Let's see what stuff this guy is made of. Maybe he's just the guy that we need. - Maybe. - Mmmmm. (crickets chirping) Hey Laura, don't tell anybody, all right? [Laura] Okay. What is this, Chico? Nothing, Commander. Visiting our supply room so late in the night, huh? Some of my men got hungry, so I thought, well I'm sure you'll let us eat, right? Wasn't that right? Oh yeah, that's right. Well you can't take it. What're you trying to do? Come on, Commander. Put it back right now. And that's a direct order. And you'll be under surveillance. I'm familiar with your kind. I saw what you did before. You weren't busy fighting during that surprise attack. But that's past business and I'm willing to forget all about that. So don't do anything to make me change my mind. Because I will do that. And with no regrets. I'm sure you understand me perfectly. So are you going to put the supplies back or what? You've made your point perfectly clear. Now of course I'll put it back. Although, I won't forget you for this. Don't make any more mistakes. We've got to stick together. Let's cooperate. It's the only way if we wanna win the battle. Commander Alexander, don't give me any of your speeches. You know I speak the truth and nothing more. Men, put the supplies back. (menacing music) Thank you, Commander. It's not the first time for them to make off with supplies. You didn't do anything wrong at all. Now go back to bed. I'm sure they won't try anything like that again, so you can relax now. Don't you worry. We gotta go. Goodnight, Commander. (ominous music) Mr. Samson, you're not being very realistic. If we combined forces, you can accomplish your goal a lot sooner. We must work to help each other. Our army doesn't need any help. You're being very stubborn. Don't you see that we're fighting for the same cause? [Alexander] No, I don't see. All right, if that's the way you feel, I won't press you. But you just made yourself a very foolish mistake. (ominous music) Hey, how's it going? Good. And that's what I get. (ominous music) (explosions rumbling) (suspenseful music) Troops, prepare to fire! (explosion booming) (suspenseful music) Come on, men! Let's go! Hurry! (gunshots popping) (suspenseful music) (rapid gunfire popping) (gagging) Back! Go on! (gunfire commotion) (suspenseful music) (groaning) (buzzing) (booming) (gunfire commotion) (rapid gunfire popping) (suspenseful music) (groaning) (water sloshing) (booming) (suspenseful music) (buzzing) (gunshots popping) (helicopters buzzing) (gunshots popping) (suspenseful music) (rapid gunfire popping) Commander, you all right? (gunshots popping) Get out of here! Let's go help him, huh? (suspenseful music) (gunfire popping) Get out! (buzzing) (rapid gunfire popping) (helicopters buzzing) (gunshots popping) (crickets chirping) How is he? Sir, they got his kneecap. (Alexander gasping) (dramatic music) It's really bad. We must get him to a doctor. You know something, he was really brave out there, Commander. He didn't care about his own safety at all. And whether he's injured or not, he's better than 10 men put together. (dramatic music) We're gonna have to send him to the hospital right away, no matter what the consequences may be. So you two men go with Rick and take Alexander to the hospital. Yes, Commander. (dramatic music) Don't worry, Terry, he'll be all right. (dramatic music) (ominous music) Hi. Alexander, I'm not gonna say anything to make you feel better. Shit, if it happened to me, I know how I'd feel. I'm gonna lay it out straight for you. Because of what happened, it's up to you to decide whether or not to continue the mission. If you gotta leave, just say so. Then what we've worked so hard for is finished. The choice is up to you. I want to stay. I don't go down that easily. Good. I didn't think you would. You know, Victor might just take this chance to try something. So keep your eyes open and let us know if you find out anything. Take care. (dramatic music) Don't you worry about him. I'm sure he'll be all right. But, sir, I'm carrying his child. (chuckling) Don't you worry about him, Terry. He'll come back to you soon. (door opening) This should work wonders. Thank Thompson, will you? I'll walk again soon. One must never give up. We know you'd get tired of lying down. It may take awhile but you'll get used to it. But I'm sure you will before too long. You control with your muscle. It's almost like the real thing. It won't be easy in the beginning though. You better take these too. It's a real fine piece of machinery, isn't it? I will remind you that the day will come. And I will never forget it. I won't rest until the mission is accomplished. I'm sure they'll be happy to hear that good news. Everyone's eager for you to get back into the field, you know that, don't you? Yes. (ominous beat music) They're coming this way now. Good. (guns clicking) Remember, do everything as planned. Go on. (foreboding beat music) (groaning) What happened to your arm, boy? (thudding) (laughing) Who the fuck are you? Tell me or you're dead. Fuck you, asshole. Don't fuck with me. Let's finish him off. (rapid gunfire popping) (booming) (yelling) (suspenseful music) (rapid gunfire popping) Freeze! (booming) (yelling) (suspenseful music) (gunshots booming) (whimpering) Hold it! Don't try it! (ominous music) Get up and fight. Come on, get up and fight. Don't be frightened. Come on! You can do it. Come on, get up and fight. Get up and fight! Get up and fight! Get up and fight! You scared? Come on! (crying) Do something! (crying) Fight me! (suspenseful music) Get him! (gunshots popping) (screaming) (dramatic music) I missed you. I missed you too, Alexander. Good afternoon. Keep your eyes open here, huh? Sir. (dramatic music) Wait here. Good afternoon, sir. Good afternoon, Henry, Chico. Did you check and make sure that all our supplies came in this morning? Yeah, they're all here, sir. What's up? Not too much. A quiet day, huh? Oh, a bit too quiet for my taste, to tell the truth. Oh, sir. I think we should split up our supplies. It's not very safe to store all our supplies in one place. What if there's another attack? What do you think of the idea? As usual, you're right. I'll see to it. You do remember what happened last time when they attacked us. Most of us managed to get away but they got all our supplies. That was a bad business. Yes, sir, I know. But it won't happen again. I don't know, Alexander. He's not in a very good mood today, is he? (ominous music) You're certain your information is correct? Yes, there's no mistake. Mark was killed by the American force. Those motherfuckers! We all underestimated them! We must do something about them. Of course, we can't let Mark die for nothing. Try to find out as much as possible about this fucking American force and get rid of them. Will do, Commander. Did you do what I told you to do? Yes, Commander. That Alexander, I'll teach him for not cooperating. When the time bomb that I told you to set goes off, a stat of confusion will result and Chico will take the chance and kill Alexander. He will then find a briefcase that contains his instruction. Yes, then the group will be under my control. It's brilliant, Commander. I knew our chance would eventually come. When I have the whole army to myself, then the American force will mean nothing to me. Or even the government. Your day will come. You just watch! You will rise to power and then the world will take you seriously and not just think about you as another loudmouth terrorist. (ominous music) (ominous music) (menacing music) (ominous beat music) Stay out of the way! Go! (rapid gunshots popping) (explosions rumbling) (fire crackling) (ominous music) (gun clicking) Jesus, Alexander! Why'd you do it? You better explain! The bastard's crazy! I say we kill him! Explain! Come on! Here! See for yourself. There was a time bomb in there. It could've easily killed us all! (ominous music) (menacing music) (birds chirping) Hey. It was lucky that Alexander found the briefcase in time. Otherwise, all our work would've been wasted. But we don't know who the instructions were for. So Alexander's still in danger. Right but he can take care of himself. I think he has his suspicion as to who the briefcase was meant for. You know what I think? I think we should kill that Victor and as long as he's still alive, he's bound to try something like that again. I'm with you 100 percent. As soon as I can locate their headquarters, we'll go in and light up their lives. So you think we need reinforcements for that? What's the matter with you, Woody? You don't got it anymore? Just being careful. Woody is right. But I don't think we'll need any help. It shouldn't be any problem if we go in with a plan. And we will. Right. Think you'll all agree that we must find out who the briefcase was meant for. Any suspect, Commander? Every single person in this room, yourself included. And anyone who thinks about it would suspect everyone as well. It's the only way for us to stay alive. I'll tell you what I think. I'm pretty sure it's one man. Why, it could be against many here. Yes, I've thought of that too. Apparently, Victor has many supporters among us and around us. It's important that we realize that Victor is an enemy. Don't let him trick you to think otherwise. He's everything we've been fighting against. Commander, we should make our move and destroy him. He's too dangerous to have around here. I agree with you. But I think we shouldn't do any fighting until we found out who the traders are. Otherwise, our plans will only be destroyed. I hate to have to make this announcement but you're all restricted. No one leaves without permission. That's a very good idea. I'm with you on that. One more thing. Each and every one of us is in danger at this moment. So everybody please be careful. The enemy could be anywhere. (foreboding beat music) It's bad, Chico. I think that bastard knows it's us. Goddamn that bastard. We have to get out. We can't stick around. But how do we get out? Don't worry, I'll find some way. You just wait and see. And Commander Alexander... He'll regret coming back. (ominous beat music) Sir. What is it? Commander, the Americans have been sighted. Looks like they're on the move here. Those assholes! Get all the men ready. Let's give those guys a welcome that they'll remember for the rest of their short lives. [Sanderson] Yes, sir. (suspenseful music) (engine rumbling) (suspenseful music) (suspenseful music) (menacing music) You sure this will work, Chico? Of course. We'll lead them back to the camp. They'll finish the job for us. (suspenseful music) Alexander! (gunshots popping) (suspenseful music) (gunshots booming) (gunfire commotion) (rapid gunfire popping) (suspenseful music) (groaning) (distant gunfire commotion) (gunshots booming) (yelling) (ominous beat music) (rapid gunfire popping) (suspenseful rock music) (rapid gunfire popping) (groaning) (distant gunfire popping) (yelling) (yelling) (groaning) (gunshots popping) (man screaming) (suspenseful rock music) (screaming) (yelling) (gunshots popping) (yelling) (suspenseful rock music) (man groaning) (distant gunfire commotion) Stop there! (gunshots booming) (dramatic music) (suspenseful music) Bastard! (groaning) (rapid gunfire popping) (sighing) (groaning) (dramatic music) (dramatic music) Well, Alexander, you were right after all. Good thing we caught them before things got any worse. I guess we were plain lucky. Their strength was increasing. Alexander. Hmm? (dramatic music) (baby crying) Look at that. This little guy must be hungry. He looks like you. We'll teach him to know the difference between right and wrong. Maybe by the time he grows up, we won't have to fight anymore. Congratulations, Alexander. Let's go. (baby crying) (menacing music) (ominous beat music) So where the hell are they? I thought you said they were seen making their way over here. They should be here by now. We better be careful. You send to guys and try to find them. Come on. (ominous beat music) (menacing music) (thudding) (groaning) (ominous music) (whimpering) (groaning) (gagging) Come on. (suspenseful music) What the hell is taking them so long? We can't wait anymore. Let's split up and see if we can find them. And be careful. (ominous beat music) (gun clicking) All right, go. Go. (rapid gunfire popping) (groaning) (gunshots booming) (suspenseful music) (rumbling) (gunshots booming) (groaning) (gunshots booming) (yelling) (booming) (groaning) (ominous music) Hey! Good. (laughing) (foreboding music) (gunshots booming) (groaning) Woody! Woody! Woody! (laughing) You! You bastard! (ominous music)
