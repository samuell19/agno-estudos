- This coke is my house in Mexico - It's there, look - No, it's not - Yes it is, yes - You better listen to your woman, not like last time - You don't talk like that to me, that's my wife. - I'll cut you. - If you talk to me like this. I'll kill you, bastard. - I'll kill you. - Here we are! Please stop. - Open the gate to let them pass, and follow my instructions! - How much do you think they're holding? - Lieutenant says 40 kilos, but you'd think they'd be able to afford a better car like a Beemer. - What is she doing? - Slow down, cool down. - Put your hands up and get outta the truck! Get outta the truck! - I will roll over and crush this bitch! - Hurry up, bitches! - Let's move on. Move! - No I do not precede - You went too fast, call it in! - 10-23, hot water! - Shoot the wheel, get the wheel. - Got it! - Shit on you Americanos! - How in the hell does that truck keep going? - Four in a box steel wheels of DJ. Shit, she's turnin' around! - I shit on you stupid americans! - This is a 10-23, we are in hot pursuit right now. Hot water. I repeat, hot water. - Blast her, blast her! - Get outta the car. Get outta the car! - Blast her! - Go to hell! ♪ I like to look on your greatest mind ♪ Shit, there's a lot of things goin' on here in the city that need, you know. But if there's any word from New York. They say New York is a the dirtiest part is you know what we do on a day-to-day basis. - Dirty? I mean dirty is what? Cops, the corruption, network. We're talkin' about drug buys. I think that Trump has a few things to say in the process don't you think or would you just? I would agree 'cause-- - Jay, honey. - What? - I can't focus on my dance. I know the music's more interesting and you jaded from all the hot stuff you experienced in your life. But I got to get ready for tonight. Well you know about one thing? - Off. Here's the bill. When you came here from Italy with that pretty ass of yours and you drove up in a 1980's, what's that piece of junk called? Well when you pulled up, I saw your swagger and I knew you's gonna make me some ducats. - Lots of ducats, you mean. By the way, I stopped now; so keep it for yourself. - Honey, the moment a broad stopped blowin', this moment she loses her home. You know. America is insane as his It's still the Land of Opportunity. - I know, Jack. That's why I'm here. I reach my goal and I'm working hard for it. Someday I'm gonna be a lawyer. - You're working hard for it. Concetta, when a man profits off another man's war and he doesn't lift a finger, that's wisdom. That's me. Nothing control empathy. - There you go. Not bad. - Oh, muerta! - Don't you look in the mirror when you back up to a car? - I'm sorry, sir. I'm sorry. Sorry's cool, I mean mi abuela work for 15 years to get me this car and it's finally paid off. - I said I was sorry. - I'm gonna need your details, your insurance information. Do you have your license? - I really am sorry. Here's my driver's license. Mrs, Mrs Concetta Masconi's here to see you. - Okay, great. Yeah, send her in thanks. - Please go in. - Thank you. I wanna talk to you about the small accident. - Katrina filled me in. You bumped into some pretty boy. Latino, I suspect. If you were to kiss him and I'll let you walk. He claims whiplash. - I just couldn't get used to this automatic stuff. In Milan, we drove fast and we drove manual. - I'm gonna try to get you out of this one, okay. - Try? I have faith in you. I hope I could be as good a lawyer as you someday. You're brilliant. Hello, neighbor. I would help you with the boxes, but you sued me. It was only a scratch. - I dropped the lawsuit. - You what? - Look, the guilt was just gettin' to me and I had a primo of mine fix the car for a six-pack and an ex-girlfriend's phone number. So there you have it. Buenas noches, Senorita. - I don't speak to strangers and sorry, I don't speak Spanish. But I guess thank you for doin' that. - My grandmother would kill me if I didn't learn to speak perfect English or if I didn't say hello to a fellow neighbor. Max Hernandez, great to meet you. - I saw this on your insurance card, but Max is not such a Latino name. - Mexican here. My mother's German. My father, he's a hardworking Chicano. He's been in the trucker's union forever. He always thought outside the box. Wanted us to too. - Well nice to meet you, Max Hernandez. I wish you pleasant stay in the duplex. Buona notte. - Wait a minute, I speak Spanish and that sounds an awful lot alike. - Italian, I was born in Italy. High school in Switzerland. We moved around a lot. My father was an alcoholic. I wanted to get away to the good old USA. - For not speaking to strangers, you sure reveal a lot of information. - You look decent. - Is that before or after I dropped the lawsuit? - Your face looks honest. I got most likely not to succeed in school. - You seem to have a decent heart. - Thank you. - Concetta Masconi. - Very nice to meet you, Concetta. - Buenas noches. - Wait a minute, wait a minute. You don't speak Spanish, you don't speak to strangers and you just did both. How am I ever gonna trust you? - Anyone can say goodnight in Spanish. - Well not as sexy as you just did. - Goodnight, neighbor. - Buona notte, Concetta Masconi. Detective Montauk, why all the heat in the department? - Look, we're seein' an insurgence of these cartels. They're inchin' their way up through Mexico, onto San Diego and even in the Los Angeles streets. Now we just don't have the budget to cover all this. - Well it's just a happy time in the department. Budget cuts and even more crime dealing with the Mexican cartel wars on the streets Los Angeles. - Somebody in the City Council, they've gotta do somethin' about it and they've gotta do it damn fast. Well, that's an outspoken cop with years of experience. - Damn, he's handsome. Latinos. Thought it never rains in California. Nothing is what it seems. Nothing. No! Help! Help! No! Just let me... Let me go! Let me go! Please, no! I beg you, please. No, please. Please, no. Please. It's all over the news. Thank God I didn't need to come into protect you. But my God, honey, you gotta be more careful. Note that I put on 'cause I got the Latino stud to drop the case. - He felt his conscience get to him. - Some people's conscience need kick starting. I'm just tryin' to loosen you up, honey. They say you're more scared after someone experiences this type of trauma. - Jessie, it was hell. It was pure hell. I'll never forget it. It was hell, Jessie. A real hell. It's not. - He is a bastard from Hell. Now just relax, okay? You've been through enough already. - Thank you, Jessie. I'm so happy to see someone. My father's so... My mother is so far away in Italy. I know you're my lawyer. - Yeah, well contrary to popular belief, some lawyers are human. At least the ones outside Century City. - Thank you, Jess. No lawsuit, Jessie. One less thing to worry about. Thanks, Jessie. - It's gonna be alright. It's gonna be okay, girl. You're gonna stay with me tonight. - Solano, how you doin' dude? Lieutenant, I need your help. I know you're still pissed off about all that stuff that happened in Santa Monica. Well it was 10 years ago, dude. Ya gotta get over it, man. I need one of your CSI guys to help me. All the storage facilities are missing loads of dope. I don't know who's involved. I got no idea. You're talkin' about a billion dollars here. Look, it's for Los Angeles and I know you're the best. You're even better than me. - Come on, I'm not so good. If you only knew how bad I can be at things, I just work hard. - That's very humble of you. - I'll get Dick to call ya. - Dick? - Yeah Richard, that's his name. - You're jokin' right? - No that's his name, Dick. I'll get Dick to call ya. You are a funny guy. Not all the time. - Yeah, me either. - Hey, your cousin did a great job. Looking good. - Hey, I heard everything that happened. Are you alright? - Heard it at your house? - No, no, last night I was at work. I had the late shift. Seven PM to midnight. I park cars at Little Theater. My old neighborhood, just 'til I finish school. - Oh, so you were not here last night? - Of course not. If I was here, I would have found that cabron. I would have beat his head in like a pinata. - I miss machismo. Reminds me of my old country. - Italy and Mexico, we have a lot in common. - More than you know. - Oh, there's a man looking for you, a detective. Detective Solano. The cop in that car. - Why do you have his card? - This place was crawling with cops earlier and after they grilled everyone... Of course, they keep the Mexican-looking guy for further questioning until that rat cop over there is done with everything. - I'm so sorry. - No, don't be sorry. This is LA, Mija. Whenever there's a crime, any Mexican in the vicinity is held for questioning 'til the end. It's just how it is. Chingo, perfecto. - I heard that. - So you do speak Spanish? - Italian, it's almost the same. Perfecto. - Sir, the team is having tacos at Frankie's. I'm off, we got it all. Also, the lady of the house is here. CSI is leaving the building. - Hey, hey, hey! You're no Elvis. - So, are you the detective on my case? - Hey, if you wanna report me, here's my badge number. Now, how long have you owned this house? - I don't own, I rent. - Cool, I almost forgot. I should tell you that you have the right to a female officer present while I question you. You also have the right to have a lawyer present. - I don't need a woman, even as rude as you are. I'm sure you know your job and wouldn't risk it at such an age. - Oh boy, jeez. You mind if I sit down? I wanna get one thing straight, right off the bat. If you don't answer a question, I assume that's a yes. You know where I learned that? Psych class. - I'm sure you learned a lot there. Didn't they teach you that it's not appropriate to leave mustard on your tie? - Better than ketchup. - This is not starting out so well. - No you're right, it is not. Are you a prosecutor or a detective? - You're very clever, good question. Yes, I was a prosecutor from '92 to '95. Some things are just hard to change. - Look, last night I answered all the questions the police had. - Oh yeah, I know. You're from Italy and all that sorta stuff. Your mother was an opera singer until she met your father. He had a drinking problem. - How did you find that out? - The internet. It used to be really special to be a detective. Hard to do. Now, anybody can do it. - My father has nothing to do with this. - No I'm sure he doesn't, but your mom lost a big fortune due to your father's drinking, right? You guys ended up living in a very humble home in Sanremo, Italy. - What the hell is this? - I'll tell you what this is. A person with an ax breaks through your window in the middle of the night, almost rapes you. Holds a very, very sharp ax to your throat. Now if somebody could be as diabolical to do that to you, he could do that to others. So around me, every pan gets fried. Every stone gets turned. - I get your point, Solano. Oh. It's Detective Solano. That's the problem with all you young, pretty girls these days. Cross all boundaries. You've lost all respect. - Am I dreaming? This can't be real. I think I've seen a few reruns from the 50s, but you jump off the screen. - How long you been workin' at the strip club? - Slip and Slide? - Yeah, whatever. - It's not a strip club. It's a gentleman's club. - Oh, have you had any problems with any of the gentlemen there? Maybe a rough lap dance or a lousy tip? - What the hell, man? Maybe I take that female cop. - Oh, no problem. Officer Dorothy Smith. 24/7 like a donut shop. If you want somethin' sweet. - You can't be much of an asshole to all women who go through this. I'm Italian. I don't need anyone, Detective Solano. I got a real handsome Latino man, lives nearby. I'm sure he's not afraid about your badge. - That guy, has he ever been to your... The gentleman's club? - No, I never met him 'til yesterday. - You know he has a record, right? - No and that's none of my business. - I think a domestic violence case is your business. He grabbed his girlfriend by the hair and he dragged her across the floor while he was drunk out of his mind. - Drinking? - Yeah. Now, he claims he's been clean for two years. - There you have it. Some people make mistakes when their drunk. Actually, I could swear I smell alcohol on your jacket, Detective Solano. Can I get you a beer? Detective Solano you don't like me, do you? When I look in your eyes, I see a man who doesn't like women. - Now that's not true, I love my sister. - Most people would have said their mother. - Oh, we were orphans. - No wonder, you are angry. - Oh no I'm not angry, I'm amazed. I tell you that someone has a record and you stand up for him. You remind me of all these Hollywood lefties where no one can do any wrong. Where is the barometer for punishment around here? - Detective Solano, when I was 14 years old in Italy, I knew a girl named Rosanna Di Romana. She used to go out with my cousin Vincenzo. They went out one night. He told her he didn't love her and that he had a different lover. She was a virgin and thought they would get married. I saw her go to the police. I saw her make a complete lie about my cousin. Just because of her word alone, my cousin spent six months in jail while they investigated her claim. Just by her words alone! No evidence whatsoever. It was forever for my cousin. - Yeah, I've read cases like that. I tell you about a potential rapist and you stand up for him. But six months is not that bad, is it? - My cousin hung himself with some sheets in a dirty jail. If you think LA jails are bad, try Italian jails. Well look, I'm sorry to hear about all of this but my concern right now is here and you. I mean no disrespect. - None taken. - Don't worry, I just arrive. I'm in the club now. Of course, I have the best stuff with me and I'll bring two Japanese to your. Okay. Yes Gregor, how long will it take 'til the Japanese are here? You have my guarantee that they will be served with the best stuff and the hottest dancing queen in the club. What about the next though? You are preparing. Why don't you invite me to come around? - Concetta, sir? We won't get any while she's updating drink order, that's for sure, Jack. And need triples through the doubles. Make 'em bite, baby. Hush all asshole. - Sir, can I get the lady a triple? - Look at Concetta one more time and I'm gonna kick your ass. - After two week hiatus, put your hands together for Concetta. Mmm-mmm yeah!

Wow! - Only for you, honey. - You said it, doll. You like to rush? I'll rip your panties to shreds. - Honey, Coco, gimme a drink. - Is that that perfect scooter gets hot as a rock? Cola? - It's not Cola, it's iced tea. - Everything don't you, hot stuff? - She's wasted. Cut her off, Coco. - Tomboy, Euro trash bitch. - What did you say? - Take Lana home. She's wasted. - I ain't ready for shit. - Go home, little girl. You remember last time. - Fuck you, Concetta. - Great, baby doll. - Good night. - You're a bitch. - They're just jealous. I missed you while you was gone. You know my two regulars? They didn't when you was gone. - I don't wanna really talk about what happened. I'm really sick of it all. It's two weeks ago and I want my mind rid of it all. These damn cops stay outside my house and I don't feel right. That bastard, whoever it was, is long gone. He ain't coming back. Probably he left the state. - I wouldn't count on that, honey. Look I make a lot of money off ya, I don't lie. You know Jack, he does not lie. I do not play the hypocrite. I need you safe. Sweetie, you keep the cops at your door for a while or you move out or-- - Or? - You tell the police you want them gone. Maybe go back in the swing of things and I'll put Old School on you for a few weeks. He just got out of San Quentin. He needs a job. Not to mention he owes me one or two or 10. - Old School? - I need to talk to you in the back. - Alright, I have to change. - Ciao. - Jack. Jack, are you sure I'm making the right decision? Turn around. So you think I want my star player runnin' around with a bunch of hogs? - Hog? What is a hog? - It's worse than a pig. I don't like that new Spic you got a dance from your driveway, baby, around a bunch of hogs. I'd like to split his head open and smash those re-fried bean. - You're even more jealous than the Italian boys back home. - Baby, daddy's hot for you doll. Gettin' good It takes a real man to It's getting good, you losing a battle. Good, huh? Ooh, this is getting good. Yeah. - Jack. - What? - Things have changed, Jack. You can make me work for you. You can make me do Coke. You can make me fuck you. But you can't make me love you. That's so of shit. - You could make me work for you. - That's okay, baby. Saki? Jack's? You just make a hell of a girl. Here you go, baby. Pour it down. Now, pour it down. Yeah! They worship the dragon and the dragon breathes fire. Ooh, baby. - You know, I don't advise any of this. The law provides 30 days police monitoring or even relocation. The designer's page, that means you're giving yourself up to danger. I just want my life back, that's all. Oh, my favorite 50s man. - Good afternoon to you too, Miss Masconi. - Have you caught the SOB yet? Guys, get rid of. I hear you want to get rid of the police monitor and here you already went back to work. I hear you went on a date with that Max, the fella near your house. - Yes daddy, but seeing a movie is not a date in my book. We went only, how you Americans say? Second base. - Second base with a convicted woman abuser? - I could use a little abusing by him. - Now listen here, lady. This is not a goddamn joke! There are 299 murderers, 736 rapes, 8,000 assaults, 7,000 robberies and on and on and on in this town! You understand? It's not a joke. You got your female here who hears all this, who's gonna protect you from big, bad daddy. Well it's my job to protect you, too! You got it? You're lucky we got a few cents left in the budget that they give us in this godforsaken hellhole! - Are anger management courses free for detectives? I was just trying to make light. I've gone through hell. I'm still having nightmares every night. Can't think straight half the time. All the time I go outside or to work, I'm just reminded because there's a cop sitting outside at my doorstep or in the cruiser. So please sir, please Detective Solano. I have some friends of friends. They're security in a car, that's a great deal. Less conspicuous and I'll be protected. They come every night from 9 p.m. to 7 a.m. Please. - Do you think a rapist gives a frick about day or night? - I'm sure they would rather have some night. - I have no idea why you didn't take the relocation program. - I moved around my whole life like a gypsy because of unfit parents. I want to stay where I am at Please understand and please try to this bastard. Let me live my life. I can't take it anymore. Just when I thought things would get more sadder around here. - Miss Masconi, no disrespect but we had to come and let you know. - I know. Jack hired you fellas to watch after me and I'm very appreciative, but I would rather just kind of live like I used to. Is that marijuana? - Roscoe takes a hit here and there. He just got out the joint. He drinks a little bit. Do some drugs, but not the real drugs. He's well-respected in the neighborhood, but we're here to protect you, Miss Masconi. - Somehow I believe you. - Concetta, are you okay? What the hell, Cholos? - Please, Max. - Odelay, old school. Hey, easy easy! - What? Can't you Cholos do anything without a gun? - I can, Ese. - Get him, Old School. Alright , Old School. - I've had enough drama. I don't need this shit! - Let's go, homies. - It's all good, okay. - It's good? Are you crazy? After what just happened, it's all good? I take back what I said about Italians and Mexicans being similar. - Wipe yourself. - Guys, we're not. We're a lot smarter and we know when to cut our loses. If these guys are here to protect you, they have my blessing. - Miss Masconi, here's my business card. We work in a local. We've got permits for our guns. We'll take care of you, we promise. We'll be watching you. - Thanks Max for standing up for me. - It's good. Too bad it was my only day off in the past month to go to the beach. - I would have known about this place if I would have been here sooner. - My father used to bring me and my sisters down here. I had a father that loved me. My mother, on the other hand, she was a different story. - At least you had a lovin' father. Mine you can forget. He was always drunk. But I do care a lot about my mom. - Oh my God, look. It's a couple dolphin and I think a whale. I love this place. Jeez, ow. - I'm so sorry. - That Old School has a hell of a right hook. I'm startin' to bleed again. , I'll fuck you blood bath. Hi, you are always welcome in here. - Don't get too crazy. I just brought you some warm tea. Chamomile, it's good for you. It calms you. - Oh mi abuela, my grandmother used to make it. It's manzanilla for us. I know its effects. It's like a little piece of heaven. - This all happened because of me. I'm very sorry. - I know. I feel very at peace in your bathroom. There's something very calming. - People have said that about me. It's a great compliment, thank you. You really know how to take care of a man. I shoulda gone to Italy a long time ago. - Astonishing things happen if you really care. Relax, big guy. I'm not ready for all that, not yet. Good things come to those who wait. You need some pain meds, aspirin, and I'm all out. I go to the store later. Maybe you lend me your keys, so the mafia boys won't spot me and I get 15 minutes of freedom. - Are you gonna be okay, Mija? - Yeah. Because you've been such a good patient, I give you a helping hand. Lay back, relax. - Hey, where are you goin'? We gotta sign in. - I don't sign in. - Everyone signs in. - Not me. - Detective? Detective? Are you not out of your jurisdiction? - Yeah sugar tits, I am. My father ran this DEA holding joint for 19 years before he was gunned down in cold blood by some punk rising up the ranks. - Yes I know, sir. His throat was found cut and his body found in four different pieces at an Italian deli north of Hollywood. Everyone knows the story, sir. - So move the fuck outta my way. - Sexist bastard. - Sexist bastard. Yeah, you're right. Maybe I am. But when my father ran this place, this DA holding joint, not one ounce of blow was gone. Not one ounce of Coke was missing and there wasn't one cop corrupt enough to have two houses in covert city. I'm tryin' to straighten this joint out. Ya got it? So where you from? Armenia? How long you been here? - Since I was three years old, sir. Why? - Do you love this country? Really, do you love it? What happened to the truck, Donnie? - It was full yesterday with H, now it's empty. - Yeah it's empty, huh? Somebody took it, right? - Yeah, sure did. - I'm gonna stick CSI up all your asses! All of you! I wanna know what happened to this shit. I'm done with this shit! I want you to count for everything here. I want you to find it, find it! 48 hours or you're all fucked! All of you! $100 a day ain't bad to be watching, huh? Hey, Max's Mercedes is gone.

Coffee? - No thank you, Officer Chase. - Okay, you'll be alright. - If you're up to it, Miss Masconi, Detective Solano would like to see you. - I don't think I'm ready for anything except my bed. I suppose my house is full of LAPD spies. - Well it seems so, everything's upside down. Everything except-- - Except your boyfriend. - He's not my boyfriend. We've only dated. - Oh, well I guess you call him your boy toy. - How is he allowed to get away with all that? - Well he does push the cot, doesn't he? - Now Miss Masconi, he wasn't there when we arrived as you suspected. Now I suspect that he's a suspect. - No way, I only met him. - So you don't think he has a motive. See rapists, they don't have a motive. They have a drive, an overt sexual drive and a sadistic rapist is addicted to anger and the feeling of danger. The fact that he could get caught. That's what he's thinking about gettin' caught or gettin' shot in the head or getting smashed or squashed up against the wall. - Like I said, anger management. - Where do you suspect he might be? You said he has a job, so where does he work? - He works at a carpark and I know he goes to school. - And you know this? - He told me he did. - Okay, Los Angeles? You cut 50 % of what people say, we take 10 % of that and it might be good if you're lucky. - Detective Solano, I'm sure it wasn't him. He's taller than the guy that tried to rape me. - Okay, okay good. You're sure of this? - Well, it seems so. Maybe he's the same. Sorry, I don't feel too well. - Okay, it's alright. If you don't feel well, we can do this tomorrow. - He's human? - Oh, that's a matter of public opinion. After 15 years of marriage, I think I'm a little biased. - Now you know our personal lives, we don't bring it into this stuff. - I didn't and you're the one that kissed me. - Okay. - You are married? Oh my God, but her name is Smith. - Well yeah, she's a feminist. Almost because of that. Well I won't go into that right now. - Well somehow it makes me feel better. - You should see us at home, we both have dyed each other's guns. Oh it's nice to see you smile after everything that you've been through. - Thank you, Officer Smith. - Dorothy. Dorothy is fine. - Dorothy, thank you for comforting me. - Well he gets a little shy in front of me, so I'll leave you both to your business. Sir, I'll be outside if you need anything. - You let those two Latinos outta holding. - That's the most ridiculously racist thing I've ever heard. I don't appreciate that comment. - Okay, what should I say? - That there's two suspects who are obviously innocent outta the slammer so they can get on with their lives. - Okay okay, I'm not gonna go up against two women alone without backup. - So Detective Solano, I want them to drive me home. I feel very comfortable with them. They make me feel very safe. - The LAPD doesn't? That is the strangest request I've heard in my entire career and trust me, I've had a long one. Alright let those two jumping beans out. - Yes sir, I'm on it. - Can I call you Concetta? - You may. - Concetta, CSI came back with the report of that rubber sampling you tore from that freak and it's strange, I'll tell ya. It comes from a particular sex shop. It makes this brand and that shop is only in Japan. That's a freak, as you would say, right? You know anybody from Japan? Maybe a customer? - Oh, not that I remember. - The ax, that came from Pasadena. You know anybody from Pasadena? - Pasadena, that's in the valley, correct? - Yeah, like you know any Armenians? - What? I'm sorry, that's an inside joke. - Not a funny one. - Okay look, my father was Italian, my mother was German. I think I'm entitled to a sense of humor. - Sir, I don't know people's race has to do with any of this. - Alright I'm just tryin' to get to the end of this nightmare. The ax is made in Pasadena, the rubber sample's from Japan. It's just a very strange combination. - Anything else they find? - No. I don't feel good about you staying at your house. Can you stay with friends or maybe family? - No, this going to be fine. As long as Bougart and Old School are near me, I won't ever trick them again and I will let them stay closer to my house. - Say what? - Those are the two Mexican American men you have in a holding cell, that your wife is letting out. Those are my friends and I really trust 'em. - We're gonna get you outta this, alright? I promise. We're in East LA, we're gonna get you out. - Yeah, you're right. I'm not gonna let this kill me. This is interesting, can we stop? I love that music. Somehow reminds me of home. - Latin. Latin, Concetta. Oh I mean Miss Masconi, I'm sorry. - Honey, I'm a stripper for goodness sakes. Concetta's fine. - My pops used to bring me here every Saturday and they got the best sopa de pollo on the spot. - Similar to Italian soup? Oh, I bet it's lovely. - No, sopa de pollo; the best in town. You see, Old School's like a celebrity in here. - He don't speak much lately. - You know Old School, he sometimes gets like a little tiger. - Tiger, my ass. A fuckin' lamb. Alright ese, let's go. Help me on the. - Who, Mija? - Mija's kinda like my daughter or somethin' like that. I guess in Italian it's different. - Mmm, I love this soup. I'm in amor, mmm. - Amor, right? - Yes, now that's similar. - Yeah, but Mexican we like it slower and rhythm, our rhythm more smooth. - Oh crap, I got the text. , Everything's handled and he's gonna stay up at my mom's house. Old School can stay on the couch. - Are you sure? I don't want to put anyone out. - Hey, it's the best thing. Whoever this motherfucker is, he wants to slice you and dice you. He ain't comin' to this part of town. East LA's off-limits for freaks like that or he gets capped LA style. - Somehow I feel so secure here. I love the food and I the people. They're so warm and nice like Italy. What's the others' place Detective Solano made me promise? - These are Los Angeles street. - Care to dance, senor? - No thanks, I got your back. I don't play games when I'm watching people's back. - I can imagine. Bougart? - Of course, senorita. My pleasure. - Detective Solano, it's all perfect. Trust me. No disrespect sir, but no cop could make me feel this secure. I don't wanna feel like in a cage. These are wonderful people and I really appreciate it. I'll probably take a week off work. Yes. Thank you, Detective. - Max! - Concetta. It's so nice to hear your voice. - Honey, are you alright? - Well after the inquisition, I feel a little bit jaded. Yet I'm fine. My nose is still a little in pain, but everything's good. I really miss your voice. - Oh baby, you got my texts right? - Yes, where you're staying it's right next to my tia's. - What? - My aunt, she lives right around to where you are. Concetta? - Yes, honey? - You know it's not me, right? - Baby, never even came across my mind. I miss you. Te amo. - Hey if you're there long enough, I might lose you to a hot Latino. - You are a hot Latino. - Ow shit, that hurts. - Max, buenas noches. - Okay baby, I'll see you soon? - I don't need a man to do that. I don't need a man. - Jack, I got you on speaker phone. - Hey, what the fuck? The house, make yourself a home. Why don't you just sit down and have some? - Are you there, Tomboy? I said are you there, Tomboy? What the fuck? I can't hear you. Maniac, quit bein' so hard on your goddamn phone. - What's going on? Old School, look at me. Mama said no guns and no business in this house. You know to listen to her. - Mija, sit down. Everything's okay. Sit down, sit down. Everything's okay, it's a good business. It's a good paying job. I'm gonna get mom that old car she'd been wanting. Everything is okay. , This ain't right. When she gets back from church, don't think I'm living here now. Do you hear this? This is bullshit we have to put up with? - Ooh! - Nice. - Spaghetti. - Bon appetito. - What the fuck kinda music is that? - It's some Mexicana, Mexican bullshit. - Jack, you should have come yourself. Missing my famous spaghetti. You sent Tomboy here, I must be special. - Tomboy's there for business. - I guess that means you pass on my spaghetti. - Yeah, that's cool. - Hey, my mom don't want any of this crap in her home. I want you out! - Mija, Mija, Mija sit down. Everything's gonna be alright. We have it under control. - Here's for your mother, for you and for all your troubles. It's not gonna be long now. - I feel like a piece of property. - Nothing personal, Concetta. - You know Old School, dude. I helped you out a lot. When you were in the slider for ducats in your prison fund every weekend for 10 motherfuckin' years. I made sure your kids were cool. I set you straight. - Yeah Jack, you helped us out a lot. That's why I'm doin' this gig. I'm man, it's all cool. - The problem is, see. She hadn't worked in a while. Everyone knows Concetta is Prime. When I lose Prime, I don't get a dime. That ain't cool. So in the front. Concetta, when are you comin' back to work, babe? - Jack, what she's been through, she's pretty bent up from last night homie. - I ain't yo fuckin' homie. I'm a republican. It's all about motherfuckin' finance, pal. Now, I'll pay you guys good. I want her back to work. - Hey, I have some say in this. Jack, are you crazy? - You better fuckin' shoot me, punk. Bougart blasts your dank ass all over the wall. I'm coming in for your scalp for a door prize. - Tomboy, what the fuck? Did you just pull a gun? Did I say anything about pulling a gun, did I? - No, sorry Jack. The bitch was bein' disrespectful. - Put it down. Put it down, now. I'm over here tryin' tend to my shiny new car and you motherfuckers are rainin' on my motherfuckin' parade! - Lemme tell you something. You wanna walk like a man, talk like a man? I'll kick your ass like a man. I'll gender bender your fuckin' head. - It's cool, it's cool. Look Concetta, it's fine. - Look, I'm losin' a lot of money each day she ain't workin'. Concetta, you know you're my number one. We talked about this. No pressure, listen. I want you, okay? I paid these guys lots of ducats and I ain't no pimp. I told you that. I treat my bitches good, don't I Tomboy? - Yeah you do, Jack. Everybody knows that. - Concetta, baby listen to me. I care for you as a person. I picked you up from that shelter when you couldn't even eat when you got here from Italy. Your parents couldn't even send you $200, remember that? - Yes Jack, I owe you and I respect you. You know that. You've been good to me, but don't forget what I've done for you. Your club is not number one until you made a lot of ducats with me, so I'm a good investment. You're a good business man. - I don't like this new Max, my friend. I just need my Benjis, ladies and gentlemen. - I understand, Jack. But if you could see my face, faster to tears this one week. Ask Tomboy, it's a little screwed up. I gotta take a break. - She ain't lyin'. - I'm okay, Jack. I'll be alright. One week and I'll be back on the pole. If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't be able to get my degree. I hold you in high regards, Jack. Pure and simple. It's Max and he's got some comin' into my town. - Okay guys, see you Monday. Weekends are free and so am I. I'll be a monkey's ass. - Yeah, Jack it's him. He's here. What the hell, Concetta? - That's the fucking cookie that she likes lick on. That's fucked. You can go out, but you can't work? - Jack, I'm going to Tijuana for the first time in my life. You should be happy for me. A girl that's gone through what I have needs a break. One weekend getaway. I'll be back Monday and we will make all kinds of ducats for you next week. You boys cool down, I'm havin' some fun. Old School follow her. - To TJ? - But-- But, my ass. That's seven Gs walkin' down the street. - Got it Jack, we on it. - I love Mexico! This is so romantic. Thank you, honey. I feel alive again. Long way from home and away from all that insanity. I was so distraught. Thank you for bringing me here. Baby I want you, but I'm not ready. Not yet. - Dammit! Dammit, you gotta be kidding me. - Baby, it's not my fault. I take care of you real good. Te quiero. Come on, kiss me. It will be worth to wait when I'm ready and I go. I go, go, go. Go. - Hermanos. We've already established that you're the resident badasses, but can we get a little privacy please? - You wanna go another round, ese? And then you ruin my Sunday meditation. - Come on guys, you kiddin' me? You've been on us all day. - Oh yeah, Latino stallion? We've been on you the whole fuckin' day, pendejo. - What the fuck, guys? I came to America for freedom. I want my freedom. Mija, don't worry. Do what you gotta do. Consider us your new big daddy. - I go back to the room and I'm staying 'til they catch that freak. I'm done with this crap. I'm an independent woman. I love you guys, but I want freedom. I'm losing my mind. - Don't worry, Mija. - Old School, I want my freedom. Guys look, this crazy is losing her mind. She just needs a little time away from everyone. - Including you? - Including me. Look, this she isn't such an easy ride. - Fuck off, we know what we're doing. - Well check this out, we ain't calling off the torpedoes until Jack says. So keep or Latino, whatever you are. Let's go, Old School. - Are you alright? Is the time now? - Yes, honey. - Timing is right? Yes, are you alright? - Yes, baby. - Is this what you need? I want to steal your heart. I wanna own your body. What? - Just love? That's what you need. We could have waited just a little longer, I would have my spirit was. - Dammit, really?! How could you let me get so close to the fire, let me tie you up and then nothing. - I wanted to trust you, Max, with my heart, with my soul, with my body. Where are you going? - School. It could've been worth skipping. - I'm so sorry. Max, just not ready. Hey guys, what's up? - I love my Torino. But you know what? This vato wants to go to the donut shop and I ain't keeping you. - Hey, I got some blush. You got problems, Concetta. Can I just go grab a donut or something? - Yes, I see - Hey I heard that in a movie. Doesn't it mean I understand? - Comprendo. - Okay well look, he's gonna stay here and I'll be back in 30 minutes. Is that okay? - Hey, you guys need both to live. Whoever that was that did that to me is not around here. There's no damn chance in hell they know I'm here, so go and take a damn break. You both need it. I love you, boys. - Hey, what the fuck? What are you officers here for? Must be for a blunt or a little joint? - He's not an officer, Old School. That's one of the highest-decorated detectives in LA County, motherfucker! - I'm impressed. Can I have his autograph? - You know what, how 'bout you-- - Hey hey, he didn't do shit man, relax! - I know who you are, Old School. I've known you a long time. I know what happened to you long ago and I know who you used to work for. I know your uncle got his hand cut off. I think maybe I should put a bullet in your ear. Can you imagine if I put a bullet in your ear? You're gonna live. But the rest of your life, you're gonna hear ring ring ring ring. Is that what you want? No, so tell me what happened to all the pallets at the DEA joint. I know the van was involved! We know it! - Hey wait, this ain't even my ride. This is a loan, now. - Tell this punk to stop talkin' to me like a rookie. Hey fuck you,. - Hey come on, man. You better do more than fuck up my hearing. - Yeah, you're a fuckin' badass right? Look at him. How 'bout I just shoot your fuckin' dick off? - C'mon take it easy on him, man. You know them eight years he was down, he was innocent. Do you the DEA has somethin' to do with that? - That was eight years ago. Back then we didn't have all this CSI, BSI, PS, what is bullshit. We didn't have all those little pings, but now we do. We know this van was traced to the DEA facility near it and we know it, so tell me what the fuck happened or I'm gonna blow your face off! - He doesn't know anything, man. Zero. - They're clean. Let's go home. - But Nick. - Max? Concetta. - Hello? - Oh yeah, I'm just callin' to check in on you, honey. - Detective Solano? - That's my name. Saving damsels in distress. It's my game. - I'm in the bathroom now. - Well listen, Concetta. I have some very, very serious information about Max and it is urgent that we speak. So can you call me back when you get outta the bathroom? - Okay, yes. - Okay. - Bad, bad, bad cop. Smoke? Old School? Old School, are you smoking out there? Old School, are you out there? Help! Bougart! I'm home, babeh! - Max? Max? You scared the hell out of me. Max, are you okay? - I lost my job today. I've been spending too much time in my social life. - Max, you're only entitled to one personality in your life. I mean usually. - I've been spending too much time tryin' to get that pussy. - What? - Do you know what it's like to see that fine little ass and to not be able to hit it, huh? - Hit it? You're completely drunk, Max. I've opened up myself to you. I told you how I hated my alcoholic father! How could you behave like this to me now? How could you do this? - You understand hit it. You understand slang, you dumb fuckin' wop?! Huh?! I'm gonna fuckin' own that pussy tonight. - No, please no! - Where are you fuckin' going? Don't make me fucking hurt you! Don't fuckin'! - Hey an infant you idiot. Here, here. We brought you donuts. Enough for you and mama is very angry. She told me to don't bring anymore to the house if not for Concina. She left all the mess with the spaghetti. But you know what? They stole mama's car. - What? - Yes. - Ey, you know what? We gotta call that... What is that fuckin' detective? Detective Montauks or somethin'? Maybe he knows somebody around that area to see who took the car. Don't worry, we'll find mom's car, okay? - Yeah, don't worry. Don't worry, in the meantime what? - Where ist the rest oft the money dumbass? - I do not know what's wrong. I got the child! - Walk you to the car. Let me walk you to the car. Come on, Old School. - They were crying. They were - No, come on. - Stop fuckin' screaming. I'm gonna fuckin' hurt you. Can you fuckin'? - It was you! It was you! It was you that tried to rape me! Are you fuckin' crazy, you dumb fuckin'? Are you fuckin' insane? Yeah, I think it's time I'm gonna hit it. You like those Cholos, man. I'll be a Cholo for you tonight, baby. Come here. Be your Cholo tonight. Yeah, yeah. - I love you! - I love you, Max. Stop it! Stop it! I'm gonna cut you! I'm gonna! - Your ass is mine. Punta fuckin'. I'm gonna take that ass tonight. Ooh yeah. It's time. Your ass is all mine! - No! - Your ass is mine! - Open the damn door. - You bitch! - Open it! - You tryin' to fuckin' get me killed?! - Get her out, get her out! Bougart, get her out! Get her out! You dumb shit. Damn it! No Stop! - It's Sunday morning, what the hell? Don't these Americans ever sleep? May I help you, Detective? - You've gotta see this. - Jack? I can't believe it. - Lots of corruption, ma'am. Mexico to Los Angeles, lots of dirty bastards. - I guess you lost your war, Jack. - Excuse me? - Oh, it's really just something between me and Jack. - I just wanted to let you know Detective Montauk and I are always here for you if you need us. - Thank you, Detective Davidson. - Goodbye. - Arrivederci. I'm gonna miss you, crazy nut. - Sir, Officer Michaels. Is it possible we could leave this for Detective Solano? - What is it? - It's pretty important, sir. We got tip from some people in the hood who knew Max before he-- - took an exit. - Yeah, before he exit the stage and left. - Cut the crap, vatos I got a report to write, what is it? - Sir, you see these DVD? It has a DVD of the night that Max worked. - We have footage of Concetta, I mean Miss Masconi, who's almost raped the first time. - In other words, it was impossible that Max did the crime. He was working. We got proof of it on DVD. - Why didn't you call Detective Solano? - Why didn't he answer? We went by Concetta's house to check on her. We went to her house, went to the living room. There's flowers all over the living room. - Alright, I got an APB on her. Open Detective Solano's door, put it on his desk and shut it. - Okay, officer. - You guys see if you can locate her on the streets somewhere. - Okay. - Check the Slip n' Slide Club. We got the streets covered. - You were right, tio. You were right about Max. He's nothin' but a drunken crack. He's not the real rapist. - I'm always right, cabron. - Alright tio, we gotta find this chick. She has a big corazon, tio. We gotta find this cop. That's the least we can do, tio. - Ain't nothin' a Latino can't do. I know a guy at. He's got address to all the detectives in case he has to put one down. - Man, you always comin' through, homie. Damn, homie's on point. - Are you gonna act like a good little girl? If you do, Lana will take off your. Ssh. - Please, I beg you. Help! Just let me go, please. I don't know who you are or what you want. Just let me go, please. I have 600 dollar in the bank and it's all yours. All of it. I save it. It's all yours. Oh, please. - Hey, hey, hey you're such a fucking ignorant slut. Look at you. You make me wanna burn my bra, baby. Let you go? I don't think so, sweetheart. You're gonna die here tonight. Do you understand me, you fuckin' slut? You whore. Go ahead, baby. Go ahead, take off your rubber. Nasty, nasty, nasty! Take it off for little Do we have here? - Dorothy? - Ey! Oh my goodness, who do we have here? Peek-a-boo! - Concetta, remember what I told you about 300 murders, 3,000 rapes and tortures. Do you know how many of those I've been involved with, I've had to investigate, I've had to endure? You know what that does to a cop's mind? Gets in my mind, makes me want it. Makes me fantasize about it, makes me dream about it. You know what, you little bitch? You cost me millions. Two million dollars to be exact and that was my cut. You had your goody-two-shoes Montauk and Davidson sniffin' up my ass, then your boy got busted. Well you cost me two million dollars and that was my cut, you fuckin' bitch! All we had to do was get that to the Japs in Long Island and you fucked it up! Well we're gonna make up for that. You're gonna pay me back. We're gonna make $200,000 off of you with a snuff film. - Snuff film? - Now lemme tell you what a snuff film is. That's where I fuck you and I kill you on camera and then we sell it to the Japs. - No! - Yes! Them little Japs gonna be lookin' at you. Jerkin' off their little spring rolls, drinkin' saki. - I used to get so angry when I was younger. He used to have to visit the strip clubs. I'd get so angry, I'd be so jealous. I used to be such a good girl. But after a while, I couldn't climax without more and more and more. I remember when he used to visit you in the strip club. You probably don't remember. He was incognito in a big hat and a fake beard. He'd bring pics of you home. He'd bring pics of you home. We both got off on you. You ruined my marriage, Miss Blondie. You pay, you pay! Fuckin' whore. - You both, you will go in jail forever. This is insane. Your police, they will go out of. - No baby, they won't. You're all wrong. You don't seem to understand. The judges, the lawyers, the cops. All the black robes, we're all together. We're all deep in the dark side and authorities take care of authorities. - You can torture me, you can kill me, you can rape me, but you will never get away from the law. You bastard! - Hello. - Bougart. - Yeah, whassup? - Officer Michaels. - Man I'm tellin' you, Detective Michaels. I know Detective Solano's involved, man. If you're scared, I'm not. He wasn't at his home and Concetta's nowhere to be found. I need your help. If I'm wrong, you have a bad week. But if I'm right and you don't do nothing fast, you're whole department is screwed. But just tell me where he goes, anywhere. Hotels, bars, anywhere. I just need to know where he's at, anywhere. - Listen here you didn't get this from me, you got it? - Come on, of course man I know. That's it right there. - That's it? That place is freaky, ese. I aint goin' in there without a piece. - I got a couple donuts back there for you. - Where are they? Bougart, you're okay? Yeah, everything's all homie. Hey man, what's up with that light man? - Hey man I'm sorry, we just ran outta gas. Do you know where there's a gas station around here? - You know what, if you go down there. There's like one right down the right side. - Shit. - Where are your balls now? Jack ain't here to save you. - Listen, listen, that's Detective Solano's house. Concetta's in there. Help her. - Concetta? She played me bad just like men bullshitting their way out of a beating. - Tomboy, let my nephew go. - Tio, don't worry about it. If I have to go, I have to go. Don't do this, padre. - Look at you macho pigs die so manly. Look at you idiots. You're both gonna bleed all over each other's macho-eaten, war-torn asses. - You ain't a woman. You're the fuckin' devil. - Tio! - Freeze, bitch! Davidson! - Tio! - I'm sorry, boys. It's my fault. - Old School. - I'm sorry. - How did you know we were here? They had CSI six months we've been following this psycho. - Tio. - I'm sorry about your uncle, man. I knew him a long time. - Tio. - I knew your father a long time. Listen to me. You don't say a fuckin' word about this, you hear me? - Okay. - Take the gun. Finish her off. - Fuckin' nasty bitch. Listen, that house on the right over there with the light on, they've got Concetta. They're gonna kill her. She's there, go! - Okay, you stay here. You stay here. - Okay. - I got back up comin'. Davidson, I got back up. Stay here. Freeze! Help! - You got one bullet left. - You too, asshole. - In a Mexican standoff, Mexicans always win. I'm sure Old School will have the last laugh. - Everybody knows you're a lousy shot. You couldn't hit the ass of an elephant. - Come on out, Wallsy. - Alright, puppy dog. - Come on out, Wallsy. Solano, lemme jump in and save her. Let me save her! - Nah you're not jumpin' in there. I'm gonna fuckin' kill you. I'm gonna jump in there and I'm gonna fuck her. - I can you outta this, lemme jump in! - Ain't happenin', asshole.
