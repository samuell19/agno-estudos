Hello, Zhen Zhen. That's right, your eyes look better if you draw them bigger. Jenny, the lipstick color looks really unique. It's a pity that your lips are too thick. Your foundation is too pale, your eyebrows are too thick. You just look like... A clown who doesn't know how to crack jokes cry in the circus. It's too heart-wrenching to watch. Jenny. Your thighs didn't used to be so huge They make skin that you are wearing now look like... like a very narrow womb, fervently supporting a pair of premature obese twins, who can't get out no matter how hard they try. It's such a sad plight to watch. Zhen Zhen Zhen! I've tolerated you for too long! You've been taunting me since day one! I've had enough! Stab me if you dare. Jenny. Remember what you told me on your first day of work? You want your dad to retire next year. Let your sister have her surgery. Send your brother to study in England. You want the whole world to know, without certificates of university education, you also can be successful just like me. Remember? You're conscientious and that's your strength. You'll notice details that many of us neglect. So you have to utilize this strength. Understand? I'm sure you haven'! had lunch. Go grab a bite. If not, your gastritis will acts up again. I'm not hungry. I'll get back to work right now. Go ahead. I want you to fire Jenny at the end of this month. Understand? Me? Rule no.2? Must not argue with mommy. Rule no.5? Love each other, for peace and harmony. No. 4? Wider. Wider. Good girl. Ladies! I love you! "Chen Xiao Hu, second son of Chen family" How are you today? Thank you...

Excuse me, you old lady. Isn't botox free of charge these days? How can you call yourself a mother? With a mom like you, your son's bound to become a gangster at 10, a thief by 20, a robber by 30, a terrorist by 40. At 50, he'll rob his own mother. At 60, he'll dig up your grave and sell your bones to the junk dealer! Don'! think I forgot about you. Get up...

I only knew that after I was admitted to the hospital, the doctor made me become Superman Do you sing like this only after you drink? Don'! you feel better after singing your heart out like this?

Don'! be like this, Brother Xiao Hu... Open up! Who's in there? Why did you block the door? Open up! I'm going to throw up! Pardon me... let me help you clean this up. Don'! move! Brother Xiao Hu, I heard that it's very popular to bathe like this in Venezuela. Bathing in vomit is great for the complexion! I finally get to try it today! I must really thank you, brother Xiao Hu. Do you know why I'm always drinking? I don't know. Dad is always scolding me. Saying I don't work hard. But so what if I work hard? No matter how hard I work, dad will never appreciate me. I didn't cause mom's death, I really didn't. I didn't... It wasn't me... What are you doing? Brother Xiao Hu, look over there! What happened? Why is it so dark? Oh dear! There's broken glass on the toilet ï¬‚oor! Brother Xiao Hu, be careful! There's broken glass on the ï¬‚oor! I saw a lizard on the wall just now, so I decided to throw something at it. Are you afraid that the lizard will eat you up? Nuts! Why are you wearing so much clothes? Feeling cold? I like to perspire when I sleep, when whole body is wet, it's easier to have wet dreams. You have really gone mad from thinking about women! That hurts! Can you be more gentle? All right. It tickles. You complain when it's too hard, and now ticklish? What you want me to do? Then don't be too hard nor too soft. Troublesome. Stop screaming! Are you trying to wake everyone? "Hao Han Bak Kwa" What are you doing? How dare you mess around with my recipe? Are you tired of living? Wonderful sauce... yummy... Why are you so happy? I invented a new sauce. I'm going to use this sauce for the upcoming "Bak Kwa King" competition. And the wretch next door will be doomed. Get it? It smells the same. What do you know? Your nose is like everyone else's, how can you smell it? I am the only one in the world with a nose that's more sensitive than a dog. You smell of sweat. Oh yes. But I really can'! tell what's inside, Actually, it's really simple. what ingredients did you use? I merely put... Would you know if I told you? Don'! waste my breath! Hi Mrs. Toh, long time no see. Boss, your regular customer is here. You go and take care of it first. Hi Mrs. Toh, feel free to tell boss what you need. Boss, let me help you keep this sauce. Never mind... I... you... Hey, be careful! You haven't been here in a while. Half a kilo of chicken jerked meat. Thank you... Mommy, I have something for you. Boss, I need to go out for a while, be back shortly. Mom, I'm being followed by Chen Hao. And the sauce is with me. What should I do? Rule no. 9. The more afraid you are, the more calm you must be. Tum around quickly and follow him. Really? Tum around! Stop! Go and look for a ladies toilet. Am I not following him? Why is he following me instead? Crazy! I swear I'm a woman. If you don'! believe me, I'll prove it to you. Pervert! Don'! be afraid, I'm best at catching perverts! Fancy a gentleman like you being in the ladies toilet. Good that you're here, I've something to ask you. Who exactly is Teh Si? Is Teh Si my son? Is Teh Si our son? Teh Si is so young, how could he possibly be our son? He's not. Don'! lie to me! I saw it with my own eyes, he is wearing the jade pendant. We agreed a long time ago. That if we had a child, we'd let him wear the jade pendant. Why? Even so, that has nothing to do with you. After the day you drove Brother Wan to his death, you and I had nothing more to do with each other. You were the one who killed master, not me! You drove Brother Wan to his death! Master was killed by you! It was you who killed him! It's you... Do you really like him? I like him. I'm already his woman. Lift up your hand. This cleaver has been with me for more than 40 years. I am going to give it to you now. He was orphaned at 5. I adopted him. I taught him to make jerked meat and treated him like my own son. Yet, he betrayed me. Do you think you could trust a man like him? The first time I had a whiff of her scent, I fell in love with her. I used my life savings to purchase her. I used my life to love her. Yet, she betrayed me. Do you think you should love a woman like her? Mei Mei, you are too forthright, people read you too easily. You need to master your emotions to accomplish bigger things. Hao, you need to speak your mind. And be a man. I am going to reveal to you my secret recipe. Go and die. Listen up, brothers of "Bai Wan Bak Kwa". I will give half of my inheritance to Hao. And the other half to Zhen Mei Mei. All of you must be united. Don't let the "tree fall and the monkeys scatter"! Do you still love me? Do you regret loving me? You have not even uttered a word, are you still a man? Go and die! What happened... what are the two of you doing? Put down the cleaver. I am trying to break up with my ex-lover and we are negotiating! We have already broken up 28 years ago. And you're negotiating only now? I am slow by nature, I like to wait for 28 years, can'! I? So why do you have to negotiate in the ladies toilet? If not at ladies toilet, should we be in the men's toilet instead? Lame! I don't know where she is. She didn't answer any of my calls. She didn't answer any of my calls. Where have you been? Why didn't you pick up your phone? That's great, now we'll see how badly he'll fall. Does this jade belong to me? Is Chen Hao my father? Don'! spout rubbish. I heard everything that the both of you said in the toilet. He said this jade belongs to your child. No wonder you sent me abroad to study since young. And now that I'm back, you sent me to be a spy. Actually, it's because you don't want to see me. You do not want me by your side. Since young, no matter what I do, you've never scolded me. Actually, it's because you couldn't care less. Yuan. Mom, Yuan is joking, right? Mom... That stingy, loud-mouthed brute of a monkey is not my dad, right? Yuan, I'll let you wear this necklace. Mom, look at me. Look at me right now! When I told you I wanted to go for plastic surgery, you gave me money. To get Shu Qi's lips, Lin Chi Ling's nose, Zhao Wei's eyes. Actually, it's because you didn't want to see any trace of that hateful monkey on me! Why did you lie to me? Zhen Zhen. Zhen Zhen, sorry. You really are me and Brother Hao's child. "Hao Han Bak Kwa" Big sister! Big sister! What are you doing... let go of me... Big sister... Let go of me. Big sister... I've checked. Everything about you is fake. Mr. Fake! It's you! (You two. Pay attention) (I'm going to film this girl) (You two are in charge of her boobs) (Squash them) (Punch them) (And make them become unbalanced breasts) (You two, film her) (Upload the video and share it with the world) (Understand) Big sister! Open the door... Superman... Don'! you do anything rash. Superman... Superman, don't die. Big sister. I promised you I'd protect you. Stupid Teh Si, I'm going to kill you! Teh Si! Teh Si, come out right now! Come out! Teh Si! Moon river. Wider than a mile. I'm crossing you in style, someday. Oh dream maker. You heart breaker. Wherever you're going, I'm going your way. Happy birthday. Are you nuts? Do you think you look great dressed up like a gender-bender? And... why did you tell people that I was your boyfriend? Do you know that the whole world now thinks I'm gay? If you fancied men, you should have told me earlier. Go ahead and cross-dress as a woman for all I care. Just don't drag me into it! They're both my daughters, one's own child, one's adopted. One says I don't want to see her face. The other says I don't want to keep her next to me. I have never harbored those intentions. Why did they say that? Yuan always says I am her little miss angel. And I have really tried my best to be their angel. Do you know? Mickey! Do you know that angels come in a pair? From now on, will you let me be your angel? You've misunderstood a situation for a long time. I didn't mean to rescue you those years ago. That day, when you were locked up and abandoned in that back alley by your enemy. I saw the ugly luggage and thought it was in the way. Sol... No matter what, let's give Yuan Yuan and Zhen Zhen a complete family. Shall we? You put the ring on the wrong hand. It should be on my right. Today's the competition, Superman didn't come home last night. Where is he? Hello, yes speaking. What did you say? Where is Teh Si? Don'! be rash, I'll be there right away! Hey... didn't you say you'll stay to help me? Gosh. Miss Mei Mei, did you forget today's the competition? Wanna buy my jerked meat to take part in the competition? I'm getting married. Do you have anything to say to me? Somebody still wants you at your age? Congratulations... Don'! you want to know who the groom is? Does it matter who it is? You're getting married, the groom is not me. Congratulations... ls the boss of "Hao Han Bak Kwa" in? Who? Yes... Me. From the Public Health Department. Yes sir... I received complaints that there were rats here. You must be joking, I've been here for so many years and I've never seen a rat. We sell jerked meat here, not rat meat. We'll know only after checking. Hey good-looking, I dropped my ring. It's not convenient for me to bend down and get it. Can you help me please? Please... It's over there... Look out for my diamond... Be careful... it's expensive. Have you found it? Okay? You're so kind, thank you. What sound is that? No, nothing. Tum around and show me. Did you hear me? What is that? Open up your mouth. Open it up... Open up your mouth. I want you to open up your mouth. I want you to open up your mouth right now! Open your mouth! Now! Open your mouth! Two of you, open up your mouths! Right now! Can you not be so intimate in front of me? I can't take it anymore! You said there were no rats at here? Teh Si! Hello! Teh Si! Mickey Mouse? So it was you who called me. It was you who told where is Teh Si. Where is Teh Si? Our Little Miss Yuan Yuan came home with crying last night. With your palm print still on her face. Defeat me and I'll let you go. Let's begin! Stand properly... hold on, I'm not even perspiring yet. Again! This... the nose. That's right, it'll be the nose. You... Teh Si... Are you all right? I'm all right. At most, I lose my nose only. I've already warned you. You are to give 3 rubbers, 2 rulers and 1 sticker each week. Why have you not given me yet? Eyes, mouth or nose? Are you all right? I'm all right. At most, I lose my nose only. You mean you are the one who... I'm her. That's me. You're awake. Who are you? Who exactly are you? I'm sorry. I'm Mei Mei's foster daughter, lam Zhen Yuan Yuan. I've been sent by "Mei Mei Bak Kwa" as an undercover. I know I look neither like a man nor a woman. But I like you! Actually... I have had someone in my heart for a long time. That's her. Who is she? That cute girl really looks like me. Don'! move... Superman. It's me. Big sister. Look at me. You're all right now. Where are the bad guys? All the bad guys are gone. Big sister. Don'! move... Although I'm injured, Don'! move. I can still protect you. Lie down! You don'! have to protect me anymore. From now on, I will protect you. Why are you the one protecting me? You're hurt, of course big sister will protect you. But, I'm Superman You're Superman, then I am Wonder woman! I'm going to hit you... The arm is bent. I'll certainly win you. The arm is bent? It's okay, I'll beat you... and bend the arm again How dare you whack me? There were some old men who tried to take advantage of me. When they groped me, they were shocked! "King of jerked meat" What? I counted, there were a total of 17 of them. Why? Gone speechless after winning the "Bak Kwa King" competition? Let me ask you, why were there rats? Why was he disqualified? I told you. I will never let anyone bully you. You! You're back? And we have guests? Come... come have a seat. Come... come this way... Come sit over here... Sit... come sit. Come, come here... Sit... It's good that all of you are back. I cooked a lot of dishes today. Since you came back together, have it while it's warm. Infernal Affairs? Actually, it's tough being a spy and is very stressful. I'm sure your health is not good. See? How skinny are you. Drink more. This soup is suitable for both man and woman. Here. Xiao Hu, you should try to drink less. You have a lot of potential. If one day, you are to strike out on your own, you will certainly succeed. Drink! Come. Why? Got hurt? I won'! ask, but you must have gotten hurt while saving someone, right? Superman has to take care of many people. So you need to learn how to take care of yourself. Understand? Drink! It's your first time come to my home. I don't have much to offer. Here, have some soup. If you like it, you can come over more often to have it. Don'! stand on ceremony. Since I'm going to be very free from now on. Try it. Drink up. Drink up everyone... Look at the sumptuous spread today. There's chicken, duck, fish, soup... except bak kwa. You guys must be the happiest, am I right? There is something else that will make you even happier. We don'! have to sell jerked meat in future anymore. And you no longer have to eat leftover jerked meat. Happy... Master. There're decades ago when I first learned to make jerked meat from you. I bathed for 3 hours daily with the most fragrant soap. But there is still this smell on me. Sometimes when I'm about to sleep, I can even smell jerked meat on myself. But today, they're telling me they want to close down my shop. They say I can'! sell jerked meat anymore. I can no longer sell jerked meat. I'm sorry, master, I'm sorry... I have mined the business you worked so hard for. I'm sorry... I'm a lousy disciple. I'm a lousy person. Just like what you said, When the tree falls, the monkeys scatter! When the leader falls, his followers disperse. We just like the tree has fallen, the monkeys has scattered. The tree has fallen, the monkeys has scattered... I'm sorry. I caused "Hao Han Bak Kwa" to shut down. No doubt I have won the "Bak Kwa King" competition, But I donâ€™t feel good not being able to compete with you. I would like to challenge you one on one. Forget it if you don'! want. Your shop has been getting smaller, your business is getting lesser. Your customers are getting older, you might as well shut it down. What are you doing? You wretch. You are disqualified for the worshiping of Brother Wan. Why can'! I? So what if you won? You won only because I wasn't competing. If I was competing, would you even stand a chance? Oh really? Don'! just talk! If you're man enough, compete with me one on one. Sure! Who's afraid who? Without any publicity, nor packaging. And no machinery. Using only manual labour. Sure, whoever does the best jerked meat will be the King of Jerked Meat. On... We will soon reveal who the King of Jerked Meat is. Old customer will try the jerked meat later. Whoever he picks will be the winner. Let the competition begin! Dad, is this meat all right? If you're skilled, you can use any meat you like! So what if you have good facilities, but no skills, you will still lose until you call mom. Call mom... Good... When choosing meat, always select the best. Choose meat imported from Texas USA, Baytown Poultry. Always be the first in what you do. Don'! be like those who always lose. Always the no. 1 loser... When slicing, you must be fast and quick. Slice it into two, clean and good. Don'! be wishy-washy and draggy. Not only must you be quick, you must be sharp. Be careful when you are slicing, and do it slowly. If not, you will cut your finger and bring it to the grill. And what comes out will not be a slice of jerked meat. But a stick of jerked meat. What are you doing? When marinating the meat, do it generously. Only then will the meat be properly marinated and achieving consistency. Unlike some people who look kind but are evil on the inside. Despicable and shameless! I spit on you! Spit... Marinating takes time, we'd need half an hour to season this Nothing more, nothing less. Only then will it be the best! That's why I always say, Research and development is very important! What Iâ€™ve just said must sound very complicated for some people. My apologies. Said enough? Start grilling! Quick... Are you blind? Can't you see there's no more meat? Okay... You see... he always likes to talk back to me. Dad, have some water. Water. Okay done, smells good. Bring the dish... How can you be his dad? Who are you? What are you doing? How could you keep scolding him? Why not? He's my son, none of your business! Not only am I going to scold him, I'm even going to beat him! I'm going to shield him... Come, let me wipe the sweat from your face. Don'! beat him again. Why don'! you wipe yourself instead? There's no need to compete anymore. It's burnt. I said stop the competition! I've lost. Our sauces maybe the same, but your tastes better. You haven't even tried it, how'd you know? There isn't any secret family recipe. The secret is when a family gets together to make jerked meat. True flavour can only be attained when you grill bak kwa together as a family. You're the real Jerked Meat King. Dad... My business has been suspended anyway. This no longer holds any meaning for me anymore. You can have it back. Brother Hao! Be careful! Brother Hao! Brother Hao! Are you all right? Dad! Get up! Dad... Are you okay? I'm all right, don'! worry... I'm just feeling a little cold... Can you hold me tight? Zhen Mei Mei! You're disappointed me. Go and die! Dad! Brother Hao! Boss! Dad, are you all right? Dad! Brother Hao, wake up! Help him! Are you okay? I'm okay. I learned 'steel head kung fu' when I was young, I'm fine. Mei Mei, I've been meaning to tell you something for the past 28 years. I'm going to tell you today. Do you still love me? I love you. Please come in... "Half a year later" Please come in... You look exactly like me. Even though you've had plastic surgery, you still resemble me. Beautiful! Doesn't that mean I've to go for plastic surgery again? I don't want to be a woman anymore. I want to go back to being a man! Nope, you said it before. You will cross dress for as long as I did the last time. And your time is not up yet. Is it nice? Tastes great. Are you happy? Absolutely! What flavour jerked meat is this? Beer jerked meat!
