Dispatch, we're pursuing a suspicious car. Grey Chevrolet, license plate SN 1104 Bangkok. Hey, can't you go any faster? They're closing in on us! Why are we running from the police? I wonder how much bad luck a person can have in one life. Shit! Hey, if I can't pay your boss this month... FIVE DAYS AGO It all started because I owed bad people money. But I couldn't find a way to pay them back. Are you gone? God... Shit! Such bad luck to have a useless boyfriend. I want you to break up with him. Only then can I date you. He and I are now... What the hell? Why were you screaming? - Ploy, can you hear me? - Yes? Hello? As you know, I'm Porsche, the Rich Elite. I don't want society to call me a homewrecker. You understand me, right? - Are you sure? - Yes. - You sure? Great. - Yes. Well, I... I'll break up with him soon. Before the end of the month. That's good. You were talking about opening a Japanese clothing line... Because you want your mom there with you, I'll pay for the store and the accommodation for you. Porsche, I'm very grateful. When we started dating, we planned to earn enough to buy a house. But now, we can barely pay the rent for this tiny apartment. - Wrong number? - No. We have a meeting with a client about making a video. What? - Today? - Yeah. I can't today. - I'm swamped with work. - Really? Yes. PLOY & DIN IN LOVE - Din. - Ploy. Didn't you say we're making a video of us visiting my parents in the countryside? - What is this all about? - Guys. - Yes? - Yes? Look over there. PREMIUM DIAMOND "PET MET PENG" "Pet Met Peng." My company sells wedding rings. Not fruit baskets for old people. - I'll get going then. - Hey, wait. At that time, I thought for a couple that's broken up, there's nothing worse than making a video of someone proposing. But... - Oh, dear. - Secretary. Find me an influencer couple and give them whatever they want if they're getting married this month. I'll give them a budget of two million baht. - I'll have a grand opening... - Din. - ...of the Love Never Dies Pink Diamond. - Din, wait. If this video goes viral, I'll make them a brand ambassador of our products. Wait, Din. If the bad luck meant paying off our debts I wouldn't complain. - Don't leave. - Let go of me! But the problem was that Ploy and I had to pretend we were still in love. I'm kind of confused about your relationship. Please let me explain. I think I should break up with Din once he takes out the ring to propose, because that's heartbreaking for most people. This will surely go more viral than an ordinary proposal video. Ploy, you can't break up with me in front of everyone. I'm not a fool. You're not a fool. People will feel sorry for you. Yes. That's very sad. Wait a minute. If you're breaking up, how will you express how much you value the ring? Hold on. Ploy. Well, when I reject him, he'll say... "Ploy, please accept this limited-edition 'Love Never Dies' pink diamond ring "that's being relaunched for their 100th anniversary. "For me, love isn't about possession. "But to give it to someone who deserves it. "And this ring "represents all my love for you. "Please accept it." That's too far. Oh, my gosh! Din. I'm very grateful for your love for me. I'll always treasure it! What's wrong? I'll always cherish it. I'll never sell it. Is it out? So touching. It's gonna be sensational. I pick you both. What? Even with the fake tears? From now on, all you need to do is to love me like crazy. Easy-peasy. ONE HOUR EARLIER Ploy and Din are together for almost four years. Din never took me to his home in Ayutthaya. But we're heading there today. Should I expect a surprise? - Nah. - I'm so excited. All right. I should cheer the driver up a bit. - To keep him awake. Here. - Is it hot? Yeah, drink up. Good. How is it? Is the coffee sweet? How can it be sweet with no sugar? Din, you're supposed to say, "Whatever you feed me is sweeter than sugar." Okay? Come on, have another sip. So? Is it sweet enough? Whatever you feed me is sweeter than sugar. Oh, Din. That's sweet of you. Be careful, Ploy. I'm driving. It's dangerous. All right, everyone. Let us have some romantic time, okay? - Bye. - Bye. - Say "Bye." Bye. - Bye. That's what I'm talking about. Work as a team. Just hang in there. It's our last video. Can't be too hard to pretend to be in love once again. This might be against my will, but I have to do it. This video needs to go viral. So I won't have to be poor ever again. But our bad luck never stops. Stop! Who would've thought that a famous life-coach is running from the police? Which one of you thinks you can't be successful in life? Say, "U-Wah!" - U-Wah! - Yes! Baby Baramee is the force that reinvigorates me. If you buy our course today... He's the inspiration that shapes our lives. One, two... - U-Wah! - U-Wah! U-Wah. But then comes trouble. I may be about to lose my custody rights. The court hasn't decided about the custody. You can't stop me from seeing my baby. Aren't you ashamed of yourself? When he cries, you can't even tell if he's hungry or if he needs to poop. How could you coach everyone how to be a good father? Ally. I'm begging you. I really can't be without the baby in my life. Without him, my work is doomed. I've been unemployed for too long now. I don't want to go back to that terrible life again. Listen. If I'd told the world what a lousy dad you are, the court would have reached a verdict. But I don't want our baby to be a troubled child. What are you doing? Let go of him. Give me back my child. - Let go! - Security! Please help! - Give him back. - Before the court date later this month. I'll do whatever it takes to show you all that I'm perfectly qualified to be a good father. And I promise you, if I fail this time, I'll be out of both your lives for good. - Get him. - U-Wah! No! Don't come near me! - Let go of my child! - Boon. I'm outta here. Officer! He kidnapped my baby! What the heck? Is he dead? Why is the siren so loud? - It's approaching so fast. - Let me check. Yeah, check on him. Where is he? Please help me and my baby. - Who are you? - Get in quick! The surprise proposal video's now turned into a fast and furious chase. Is someone trying to kidnap your baby, Mr. Boriboon? Why are we running from the police? Didn't you watch "Internal Affairs"? Andy Lau was a spy in the police force. And no one knew about it. But that was just a movie. It's based on a real story. This movie also taught you a lesson. The good are among the bad and vice versa. So you can't trust anyone by their looks. Can I trust you, then? What? Sure, you can. I'm wearing a suit, don't you see? So confusing. What's happening? If you'll drive this slow, we might as well walk. I'm stepping on it. - Do I need to do everything myself? - Hey! - Hey! What are you doing? - No, you can't! Stop the car! Stop the car! Don't step on the gas. Don't step on my foot! Turn! - A fork! - We'll be fine! Go! Go! Go! This is great! I've found the perfect video content. We're running away from the police, everyone. - We're now... - Hey! What are you filming? Stop it. My image is copyrighted. You can't film me. That way. Wait. Where are you going? I need to propose to my girlfriend. - You're proposing? - Yes. You're YouTubers, right? Yes. - How many subscribers? - Over 100,000. You just watch, Ally. The image of me taking care of Baby Baramee in this couple's video will prove how great a father I am. I can be your priest. How's that? That's not necessary. I don't need one. It's just a proposal, not a wedding. You need me. We'll just make it up. Just say you met a noted life-coach who gives you energy and becomes an inspiration for your marriage. I should stop the car and turn you in. You're stomping on my foot. - Shit! It hurts. - I suggest you think again. Everything I said is free. I won't charge you a dime. My baby is also in the back. Is he still there? He is. Wait a minute. You should be paying us. - This clip will help promote your brand. - No. It's a win for us both. You get the views, I get the publicity. - Do something, Ploy. Stop filming. - I think it's a good idea. Every time we've collaborated with other YouTubers, our view count reached over 100,000. With the baby, it'll be crazy! Your girl is smart. Why are we stopping? Yeah. Keep going or they'll catch us! Did we lose them? - Get off. I'll drive. - Get off of me. - You get off! - Stop! Where is this place? Fearless Love - Let's turn around. - I think this is fine. It's so dark. I can barely see a thing. - I don't think it's this way. - Look. We're on the right track. The road is too narrow. Tada! Today, I'm spending my precious time taking my son, Baby Baramee, for a father-and-son trip. There, there, baby. Let's check his backpack together to see what's inside. Let's check it out. If you don't agree to go along with our story line, I'll let you off right here. We don't need you that much, you know? - Din. - What? It says here in 900 meters we should turn left to go through some village. Have you never heard someone following Google Maps and ending up in a canal? Don't say it out loud. I told you earlier that we should turn around. - Was that better? - Okay. Can we play some Blackpink? I need a change of mood. This is too creepy. No, it's copyrighted. - Seriously? - Let's make some clips now. Why can't I do what I want? Din, I'm scared. Don't be. We're all right. - I'm scared. - Don't be, okay? I'm here. It must be cold outside. See all the fog out there. How about we open the window and feel the fresh air? What's that smell? It stinks! Did someone burn sewage? It now stinks in the car. It's a thick fog outside. It reminds me of a ghost story my grandma told me. A ghost story? Tell me. No way. It's very scary. Tell me. Grandma called it "The Village of Death." Wow, it even has a name. The way to the village is filled with thick fog just like this. Once you pass this fog, you'll see a scary creature lying in the middle of the road. - Really? - Yes. Grandma said... It's like that. Exactly like that. Pull over. - It could be a man. - She said it's not. I'll run him over. - Then run over it. - What do I do? - Run over it. - Watch out! - Go around! - Run it over! Are you all right? What? No Service here? Everyone. This is Uncle Phol, the new member of our trip. Ta-da! We have Uncle Phol to thank for. Because if it weren't for him, Din would have driven right into the canal. Uncle Phol is so kind too. He's towing our car to the repair shop. He's so sweet, isn't he? Uncle Phol. Can you smile for the camera? You have a nice smile. The atmosphere here is so... It's so quiet. Uncle Phol. How about you sing me a song? To lighten up the mood a bit. You know, like... Is she possessed? Shit. What a huge mosquito. - What were you saying? - Forget it. Honey! Miss you. Keep up, okay? What a spoiled brat. She really never listens to anyone. But she's right. If Uncle Phol wasn't here, would you stay there and wait until morning? So many mosquitoes. You would probably die of dengue fever or malaria. Or elephantiasis. You'll die with big feet. Mosquitoes are dangerous these days. I think he's more dangerous. He drinks fresh blood. Look at his eyes. He must have cataracts. I can barely see his pupil. Maybe he's wearing a lens. I suggest no mocking each other. The way he looks, he's definitely a ghost. A mosquito flew into my mouth. - Hey! - What is it? My baby. Where's my baby? He's right here. Baby Baramee is asleep. Very soundly. What's that? Is it like a hand brake on a bike? BAAN WOENG TA CHAI BAAN WOENG TA DIE DIE All right, here we are. I'll show you around. Uncle Phol. Wait for me. Hey, Ploy. Can someone give him a nail clipper? It's so squeaky. How could I forget the key? I shouldn't have forgotten it. How could I forget the damn key? - What are you saying? - I forgot the key! Forgot the key? I'll help you find it. Why would you help him? - Where did you put it? - Ploy. Where could it be? Is this open? It's locked. - Ploy. - What is it? Let's get out of here. What's the matter with you? You can be at ease now. If he's a ghost, he would've probably walked through. How did he get inside? Uncle Phol. You totally startled me. - Isn't it obvious? Let's get out of here. - No, no, no. Uncle, you really climbed over? You're so strong. You'll have a long life. - Come on. Let's get inside. - Go ahead. I'll wait in the car. Suit yourself. What about you, Coach? Coming with me? Let's leave. I didn't forget him. Just wanted him to sleep longer. It'll make him smart. Wow, Coach. You're the best dad ever. Let's get inside. Are you a collector, Uncle Phol? You can make this place a museum. Let me put you down here. You're a little heavy. Were you a soldier, Uncle Phol? A soldier that survived a war, That's awesome. I'm sure you killed plenty. You stay here. I'll be back. Can't he just wipe his mouth? It's so dusty. He looks familiar. Why is it so hot? Where the hell am I? Who the hell are you? - Why are you hitting me? - Where's Pim? Blood! He's burning me alive! Light it up! Hello, everyone. Right now, I... I have no idea where this place is. And... no idea who I am with. The fog here is getting heavier by the minute. And this fog smells like rotten flesh. Burned and rotten flesh. Did you... Did you happen to see anything here? Something just now? Come on. All right. I guess it's nothing. So let's just take a look. Let's just check it out. So we can witness it together. Okay? Shit, I don't need a howling prelude. Do you want me to see it that much? How about we hunt it down? The sound came from somewhere near here. So black. I knew it's a black dog. I'll throw a stone at it. Don't worry, everyone. It won't hit the dog. No, no. It really didn't hit the dog. It's just a scratch. I'll show you. You can see a trace of dirt there. Look. See there? A trace of dirt? Can you see? And also a part of... What is that? Shit! Ploy, we really have to go. How can we leave? The car is still not repaired. Damn it. Shit! What's going on? I just saw... It's a haunted doll. - Why bring it here? - It's dark. Let's turn on the lights. - Or stay in the dark. - It's okay. Keep it on. So it's clearer on camera. - But it's too bright. - Keep it on. The dead are still with us. I'd rather stay with my son. What do you mean "The dead are still with us"? Come closer. I'll tell you. I don't want to know anymore. Instead of telling me that, how about fixing the car for me? No! I have no spare parts. You need to wait until tomorrow. You have to stay here tonight. Here? No way I'm staying here even for a few minutes. - Make yourself at home. - I just can't. There's a homestay here. Really? There are a few beds available. How lucky. It may be old. But it's comfy enough. The dead are still with us. Ploy. - What's with you? - Listen to me. Slowly walk out of here. Who knows? We could run into something more normal than this. Din, don't you think this is the kind of weird thing that content creators like us need? This clip will definitely be a hit. Now we're in the middle of a corn field. The ambience is somewhat eerie. So quiet like a graveyard. Anyway, I'll take you around and see what's around us. Let's go. Smile, everyone. Smile, my baby. - My baby looks good on camera. - Let's go. Tell me something... Don't you think these dolls are staring at us? - Yes, this one is. - No! It's cockeyed, Coach. - You're funny. - Gotcha. What's so funny? Din, listen. I once saw a village on Facebook. It's in Japan. It feels just like this. A village in the valley far away from everything. The youngsters come back and make dolls of people who died. Then they'd put the dolls around the village to make it feel like they're still alive and well. So the other villagers wouldn't get lonely or depressed. What are you so afraid of? What the hell? Uncle Phol said it might be a little old. But it looks like it's not in business. Are you sure about this? From this spot, we can see Uncle Phol's house and where our car is parked. You can be at ease now. Everyone, let's check this out together. Let's go. Come on, guys. Wow. Look at that, guys. Looks cozy and hip. - Look at that. - You must be kidding me. Why is it so dark? I see no light switches. It's here. Shit! It's too green. I'll turn it off. Don't! It's too dark in here. What's the matter with you? Are we going to talk to this green face? This is so creepy. - It's so dim and so green. - Are you scared of ghosts? Have you seen one? Nearly. That means you never saw one. You never saw one because it doesn't exist. Whatever. I'm still scared. I'll set things up then. What a wuss. Hope you didn't forget the firework you're supposed to light after proposing. Did you forget it? I'm not that forgetful. We'll see about that. Shit. I forgot the charger and the extra batteries. What? - That must be the ghost. - Are you... I meant no disrespect. ...going to help me up. Okay. Yuck! It stinks! What's that smell? Can you smell it? I know you're trying to distract me from the fact you forgot the batteries. Check your armpits. Maybe it's you that reeks. I so want to hit you now. It really stinks. Could it be... the coffer? What? The stench from the coffer. Coffer? This one. This coffer. You mean the chest. But it's like the smell is getting closer. Yes. The smell is all around us. No, please. It's so close now. So close indeed. It's right in front of my face. Get his ass away from me. - Your baby just pooped. - No wonder my hand is gooey. - My poor baby. - What did you feed your baby? I think his bowel is rotting. Where's the restroom? Is there even one here? Shit. Wait for me here, okay? Perfect. Perfect position. Oh, my. Did he get his tetanus shot? Hey. Come on. It works. Don! You all have to pay! Let's check out our bedroom for tonight. It's filled with antique items here. "Vintage" would sound less creepy. Ploy, someone just scratched me. There's a ghost under the bed. Let's get the hell out of here. Wait, Din. Stop right there. - I'm outta here. - Din. Din, how about this? I'll look under the bed. If I see a ghost, I'll get out of here with you right away. But if I don't see anything, you have to focus on making a good video and stop all this ghost nonsense. Do we have a deal? - Promise? - Sure. Just earlier, my son, Baby Baramee, pooped through his diaper. Actually right now, I'm also exhausted from a long journey. But he still managed to boost me and make me feel energized once again. I'm happy whenever I take care of him. Come on, let's clean up, shall we? Here you go. The yellow liquid from my baby's butt is like a golden ray shining to light up the heart of all... Let's witness it together. We'll look under the bed. Let's go. - What's the matter? - Wait, I'm not mentally prepared. Come on, get down. That's it. Let's take a look together. This is when the ghost comes out. - Ploy, let's go. - Wait. Not just yet. We have to look under the bed first. - Come on. - Can I not look? - I don't want to look. - Get down. - Ploy. - Come on. Get down. Yeah. Hey! Don't do that. Can't you see there's nothing here? Now you have to do as promised. Ploy, did you hear that? Sounded like a knock. Over there. Come on, Din. I really heard it. Don't be scared. I see a silk towel for me to use. What's this stain? Gosh, what a fishy smell. But it's okay. I'll wrap you up, okay? All right, it's done. Let's go. Coach. Can you stop him from crying? I guess it's disturbing the other guests. What am I supposed to do? What? You're his dad. Don't you know how? Go on. Of course, I do. I'll make him stop. It's a piece of cake. There, there, my baby. Don't you know "Baby Shark" can do the trick? "Baby shark?" What's "baby shark?" I'll show you. That's it. Try it. Ploy, no! Don't open it! Did someone knock? This shark is very tiring. Don't open it, Ploy! - What's that? - Birds. - This is not funny anymore. - Ploy, wait. If you have a problem, show yourself so we can talk. - Let's sit and talk nicely. - What's with this house? - What's your problem? - Ploy, no. I think... I saw... Where are you going? Don't! I'll tell Uncle Phol someone's trying to mess with us. - You can't go. It's dangerous. - He's right. If they're bandits, they're probably waiting for you outside. Do you think it's safer to hide in here? I think we should ask the locals for help. Wait. Stop! - Let me go instead. - Took you long enough. You go. What? You can also ask if they have milk for your baby. Are you going to let your baby cry all night? I'll take care of the lady here. - Easy-peasy. - No need. I can stay here alone. I don't need men. Go. - You might need me. - No, I won't. Go. Hey. Is it expensive to make a ghost hologram? I'd like to have one at my next seminar. Hey. It looks so real. So cool. What are you talking about? What's a ghost hologram? He's not here. Do you believe in ghost-hunting cameras? Wait a minute. Don't tell me that you... You saw something on camera? The thing is... Shit! Uncle Phol. Where did you come from? I just finished taking off the towing hook. What are you doing here? Well... The thing is... Someone was knocking on the windows. When we opened the door to check, no one was there. Was it you who knocked? No? It wasn't him. Then it must be some bandits. From the looks of it, there's a group. - Let's call the police. - No! All right, we won't. Could be Granny Mee who sells toys, she's with Granny Moi who sold weed tea. Granny Mee selling toys... Granny Moi selling what? Weed tea. What? - Can you repeat that? - Sure. - Weed tea. - Weed Tea. Why did they have to knock on our door? Once upon a time, Moi's weed got stuck on Mee's toy. Mee was so upset and had a fight with Moi. Moi ran away. In the end, Mee found Moi's stabbed body. With her guts on the outskirts of the village. Let me guess. The culprit hasn't been caught. Right. I'll be off now. Where are you going? I haven't finished. Listen to the end. Your hand is so cold! Can you go straight to the end? Mee was devastated as they were a lesbian couple. She kept telling herself that Moi was still alive. She started knocking on every door to look for Moi until recently. Is that the end? Can you repeat it? I lost it at Moi's toy got stuck on the weed of Mee... - It's the opposite. - Let's just... What are we supposed to do? Let me take care of that. You can rest in peace. Wait. - Why did you stop him? - Have you got Mee's milk... I mean UHT milk. Have you got some? You aren't milking a buffalo for your son, are you? He'll have diarrhea, I tell you. Let's go back. Let go of me. Hey. The battery is running low. Just looking into my baby's eyes, I knew right away how hungry he is. How could a great dad like me do nothing to satisfy his hunger? Go ahead. You can walk through that haunted corn field back to the hostel alone. I'll stay here and milk the buffalo for my baby. Baby Baramee, hang in there, all right? Hey, listen. Let me get this straight. If I could walk back by myself, I would be gone. Please come with me. Help me milk the buffalo first. Then we can leave. Come on. Look at you. So nicely wrapped up. Do you like it? You look like a baby guardian angel. Come on. Let's explore the kitchen. What do we have here? Anything to eat? The fridge. Let's take a look inside. What do we have here? There, there, there. There, there. There's nothing there. I have to hide you somewhere safe. What is it? Stay here for a while, okay? Don't make a sound, all right? I'll be right back, I promise. Okay? Good boy. I must have been hearing things. Let's go check on Baby Baramee. If Din was here right now, he would definitely wet his pants. The floor probably creaks. Everyone, it looks like a museum here. This must be a tea kettle. Over 100 years old. Oh, gosh, everyone. This looks like an ancient tattoo. Looks so mystical. Look. Look at this cloth. This must have been used for real. Look over here. There's a blood stain. I wish you could experience this for real. This place really gives me goosebumps. Come on. Let's explore a little more. This must be real gold. If I sell it... A proposal video has turned into something else. But you know what? You don't look like a couple that's getting married. We already broke up. Do you expect us to act like we're crazy in love? - We're obviously doomed. - You broke up? What the heck is that? The figure wasn't here, was it? - It wasn't. I'm outta here. - Wait. - What is it now? - What do you mean you broke up? What about the proposal video thing? Explain yourself or I won't let you go. What's the matter with you? Tell me. If the court finds out I put my child in this failed relationship situation, I'm surely going to lose the case. Damn it. The case? What case? From now, you can't have me or my baby in your video. You're not allowed to have my face or Baby Baramee in any part of your video. How am I going to edit it out? You're in all of my videos! - I can't do that. - How about this? If you delete me and my baby from all your clips, I'll be your life-changing coach for free. One on one. How about you coach yourself first? I think the worst environment for your baby is you. Don't blame anything else. Hey, stop! What the hell are you doing? Why are you... Hey, wait! Stop it! - Coach myself? - What the hell is wrong with you? Do you think you're better than me? Then why did your girlfriend dump you? What a loser. You couldn't even keep your girl. Watch out! Behind you! On the buffalo! Watch out! Milk... for my baby. Hey! Not now! Coach. Coach! Get up. We have to run. Come on. KHUN AMMAHIDHRACHAI "Khun Ammahidhrachai or Thong Kon, the Warrior of Devil Sword, who has no records in Thai Chronicles." He looks so cool. So cute. Hey, no! Get a grip, man! I'm exhausted too. A ghost. It's really a ghost. How could you dump me like that? Didn't you know that corn leaves itch? Shut up. The ghost might hear you. - Hey. - What? I told you not to film me. I'm not gonna do that. I'm gonna film the ghost. The ghost? You should've just said so. - What? - Shit. Can I scratch now? Damn ghost and itchy leaves. What a crazy night. Ploy. Ploy! Baramee. My baby. Ploy. My baby. Ploy. My boy. Ploy. - Hey. - What? My baby is missing. - Where are you going? - Ploy. Ploy. Ploy! Ploy! Ploy! What the hell? Shit. Get the knife and cut it! Come on! Don't just stand there. Move! Where's Pim? Coach. Coach! Don't come near me! Who said I wanted to? Are you crazy? Are you possessed? No. No! What the hell is going on here? What the hell is happening? Ploy. You can't die, Ploy. We still have to make our video. You can't die. Ploy. Ploy. Ploy. Ploy, please wake up. Ploy. Ploy. You woke up. Ploy. Ploy! Stop! Ploy, where are you going? There's a ghost in here. I've checked. No ghost here. Listen. Come here. Listen, I've checked with this. Look. Ghost-hunting cameras exist. - I'm locking the door. - Wait. - Why? The ghost can vanish. - But Baby Baramee can't vanish. - You. - Hey. - Where is my baby? - Calm down. Tell me! I hid him in the kitchen. In the kitchen? - He wasn't there. - No? I looked and he wasn't there. You were the last person with him. You're responsible! - Where's my baby? - Calm down. Easy. Just stay calm. We need to pull it together now. First, we need to deal with this ghost thing. Listen, we just can't see it. So we think it can vanish. But it walks just like us. Think about it. When it wanted to come in, it knocked on the door, so we opened the door for it. You mean we can use the camera to find a ghost-free area - and get the hell out of here. - Exactly. How many cameras do we have left? One of yours is gone. And this GoPro, 13% left. And this one of mine, nearly dead. Shit. I feel like someone pushed down on my chest. Ploy. - What? - Secure and lock the door. Coach, help me put the cupboard against the door. No, no, no. - Coach. - What? Why are you standing there? Give me a hand. I'm not touching any antique items! Why not? It's about life and death. This cupboard is so heavy. Help me push. - Come on. - But... But I... I got a flashback. What's the flashback? Every time I touched an item here, it's like there's a special effect of a bright light and a whooshing sound. Next thing I knew, I was in someone's body being tortured. I was being flogged and hacked and burned alive. And everything felt so real. All the pain, the burning. It's extremely excruciating. I still find it hard to believe that ghosts exist. Now you're saying you had flashbacks? Then you secure the door. Ploy, you got to help me. Come on. The ghost probably has a sword. Who lit the fire? Let's go. - Come on. Go. - Do I really have to touch it? Yes. - Push harder. - I'm giving it everything. Hurry! - Din, look at that. - Look at what? A secret chamber. Look. Is it this the house? Yes. Why is the place burned down? What does this have to do with us? Why are they trying to kill us? Hey, wait! What are you doing? Your flashback. We need to know what they want so we can work it out. - Yes! Good idea. - No freaking way! I said no more flashback. It hurts! I can't die here. Who's going to take care of my son if I die? Hang on. Look at this woman. She has a massive forehead just like you. - You have a big forehead? - You can park a car on it. Look. He's right. It's freaking big. Hey! This is a serious matter. - I'm being serious. - It's big, so what? Just look. Look at that. - Looks familiar? - Who? This one? I don't think so. Me neither. Hey! So tired. Who's this? Look. Why can't I control the body this time? Everyone's going to die because of our love. Let go of me! Where's Pim? So? Got anything? - I got it. - What is it? You were the Khun's wife. And you tried to get away with her. The two of you were in love. - An affair? - An affair? What does it have to do with me? Damn it! - Give me the camera. - Hey, wait! - No! - Just let me go! - Give it back! - Get the camera! Just let me go. It has nothing to do with me! - Just let me go! - But I need the camera! No! Hey! Wait! Ploy, let's go. I'm so outta here. The milk. Coach! Give back the camera! Where are you going? I can't do this anymore! I'm getting outta here! It's every man for himself. Isn't he dead? Din, look at this. Camera. - Wait, how do we turn this on? - Come on, Din. Where is he? - Where is he? - Not here. I can't see him. Is it there? No. Where is he? - Where is he? - Get the phone. - Look for him. - Not here. - Where is he? - I can't see him. - Nothing? - I don't see him. - Ploy. - What? - What is it? - Get on my back. - Why? - If he could survive the jump, we can too. - No way. - Let's try our luck. - Are you sure? - Come on. Keep the camera on, okay? You love him so much? Get down! He's coming. Din, get up! He's here! - Just a sec. - Get up now! - Hang on. - Come on, Din. Let's go. Get up! Come on! Help. I can't get up! Wait, no! Wait! So high! There's a roof too. Din, hang on. He's here. - What the hell! - Jump! We're going to die! - Come on. Get up. - How did we survive? Unbelievable. Where are you, my boy? Where are you? Poor boy, if anything happens to you, how am I going to live? When he cries, you can't even tell if he's hungry or he needs to poop. How could you coach everyone how to be a good father? You're somewhere here. Daddy is coming, all right? Where are you going? To get the E-Tak truck and get out of here. Can we just run out of here? Don't want to go near there. The main road is far. You think you can run? I can barely feel my legs. Wait. Why stop? The ghost may catch up any time. Put on my shoes. Come on. Come on, lift your foot. - I'm okay. - You even wear slippers at home. - And you? - I'm used to being barefooted. My feet are rough. This won't do me any harm. Don't worry. They may not fit. But it's the best I can do right now. Okay. Thank you so much for trying to do things against your will. It actually feels kind of nice. Well... it's our last video after all. Let's do this. Let's try... Let's change the mood a bit. It may help relieve your fear. I do it often. Trust me. Give me that. So? Feel better? Ploy. Let's go. Din. Give me your phone. I'll keep an eye on the ghost. Good idea. The memory is full. - Then delete something. - Now? Hurry up. Are you done deleting? - Delete them yourself. - Why? Hold on. Quiet! What are you doing? We need to distract him. I don't know if it'll work, but we need to try. Okay? Quiet. Don't make a sound. Din, a rat! Ploy, don't scream. - Ploy, don't scream. I'm here. - Rat! Is it gone? Is it gone? - Not yet. - Not yet? - Not yet. - Chase it away. - Shoo! Go away. - Chase it away. Go away! Ploy, don't make a sound. - Go away. - Lie down slowly, okay? Okay? Don't be afraid. I won't let anyone hurt you. Even myself. Don't be afraid. I'm here. What the hell? Shit. Shit. I'm out of here. Are you kidding me? This is suicidal. I don't know who you are. I don't know what you want. If you return my baby now, then we're at peace. But if you don't, I'll find you and kill you! My baby. My baby. My baby. My boy. Are you there? Don't come near me. My baby. My baby. No! You can't burn my son! Help! Please help my baby! You already know how it feels to lose your baby. Why are you doing this to me? Please give back my baby. Just take me instead. I may not be as cute. But I'm a smooth talker. Give me back my son! I said give him back! Give him back. Give him... You must be hungry. I got some milk for you. Drink some. Drink it. The taste may be unfamiliar. But if you keep drinking, you'll get used to it. Good boy, don't cry. Daddy is here. Good boy. Yummy, isn't it? Shall I sing a lullaby for you? I'm so sorry. My baby. My baby. You're full of ant bites. Does it hurt? I think I found a baby-powder. I'll get it for you. What kind of powder is this? Very rough. You can't leave me and our baby. How am I going to live? No. Don't go. No! - Ploy. - Are you all right? Come on. Shit, it's locked. - Ploy. - Come in. - How did you get in? - Climbing. I climbed. - Through that? - Come here. This way. - You could open it. - Come on. Hey. Keep quiet. Give me your foot. - Easy. - Put it down. Oh, boy. Your rash is starting to show. These damn mosquitoes. They're terrible. I remember when you were nursing me when I had dengue fever. Back then, you would wipe me down with an iced towel all night. You were so harsh. You had a high fever. If we had made a video back then, it would have been a hit. Still talking about making videos? I should find the starter for the truck. - Hey, don't. - Why not? What do you think? Look at your foot. I'll find it. You stay here. Now that we won't make videos anymore, I feel a little sad. Sorry. Sorry for what? Don't worry about it. Sorry that I'm not rich like Park Saeroyi. I guess he's gone. Stay still. - Din, are you all right? - I'm fine. What do we do? Hey, Ploy. Let's hide up here. How do we get up there? Step on my back. - Come on. - On your back? - Are you sure? - Yes. Go. - Just... - A little higher. Din, come up. Come on. Take my hand. Hey, what are you doing? Let it go. No, Din. I'll distract him. He wants to kill you. - He won't kill me. Trust me. - Din, no. - Let go. - Please don't do this. Din. Din. Please come up. Please don't do this. - Din. - Let go. Din. Open it, Din. Please open it. Din. Please open it. Din, please open it. I've been so stupid. I had real treasure by my side all this time. But I chose to take it for granted. Now that it's about to be go away, I started to regret it. I've now realized how precious it is and how much it means to me. I'm so sorry, Ploy. I should've taken better care of you. I'm sorry. Now I know who I was. And what happened in this village. That night, it was a blood moon just like tonight. Back then, I was a monk in this village. And this is what you all have to pay. No! Both of you ran into my hut to hide. That Khun guy saw you and came after you. Burn it all! Pim, let's go. Pim. Pim, wake up. What's this stupid net? Sir. Don. Please don't hurt us. We really love each other. You have no right to love her! Pim, wake up! I will kill you. You are my property. Your heart must belong only to me. If I can't have your heart, I'll never let anyone else have it. So you caused the fire that burned the village? Yes, it was me. Even though you killed me in this life. In the next life, I shall love Pim again. Don. May this humble heart of mine... bond with yours forever. - Pim. - Don. Don. No, Don. I hereby swear I shall love this man in every life ever after. And this was what happened to Thong Kon. The Warrior of the Devil Sword. Wait. Where's your ex? Holy shit. Ploy. What is it? I don't think your ex will make it. - Why did you stop? - Coach. What? Why did you say that? I just... "I've already proposed to you. "Ploy, "you can... "say the breakup part." Din. Din. Din. Gosh. - Hey, wait. Hang on. - Din. Listen. Listen, you can't help him. Let's get out of here. Coach, if you can't do this, you may leave. We've just met after all. All right. Let's go our separate ways. I hope Baby Baramee will be proud of you. Wait. Do you know how to start the truck? I was amazed you could start the engine. Now you're even driving it. I observed Uncle Phol all the way. I guess I must've picked up something. But won't it be faster if we walk? Look around you. You want us to walk? We'd probably stumble and die. Wait. Do you think the figure looks a bit strange? Din must have gone this way. Oh, boy. Din. Din. Din. Am I dead? Finally, you've come back to me. Who came back to you? Ploy has run away. She's far gone. She'll never come back to you. Finally, the wait is over. I think this is a misunderstanding. This must be a mistake. Let go of me. I said let go. Let go. Get off of me. Don. Please stay here with me. Stay with the one who loves you the most. Please don't ever leave me again. I'm begging you. No way. No, it can't be me. - This can't be true. - I'm begging you. Don, hang in there. Get up, Don. Don. Don, no. Don't go. Don. Don! No. What have I done wrong? Why are you doing this to me, Don? I hereby swear I shall love you in every life ever after, Don. Here, break it. Din. Din. - Coach. - What? Can you help me here? Coach. I forgot there's another one. Can you stop hitting me? Let's go this way. Come on. You're safe with me. Hurry. Is the rope cut? Don't be scared, all right? Nothing to be scared of. I'm right here, Din. Hang in there, okay? Din. Please don't hurt Ploy. You gotta hang in there, Din. Ploy. Let go of me. If I can't have your love, no one else can either. Because you are my property. Your heart must belong only to me. It's a heart with no love for you. Why would you want it? Why? Get off of me! Then I apologize in advance. No matter what, I'll always love you. Only you. Let go of me. Let go. Ploy. Don. If you agree to stay, I'll let Pim live. I'm right here, Din. Just hang in there. I'm right here with you. Din. You gotta hang in there, Din. Fine. I'm right here with you. For me, love... isn't about possession. But it's about seeing the one we love happy. Be happy with someone. Even though that person isn't me. You gotta hang in there. I'm right here with you. And that's... my definition of love. That kind of love doesn't exist. I'm about to show it to you. I'll prove it to you. Ploy. You gotta hang in there, Din. Din. No, Din. Din. How could you do this to me? Din. Don. If I die here, I won't be able to see the person I love being happy. Din. Din! Din, wake up. Are you going to let me stay like this? Just pull me up, will you? I said, pull me up. Why did you let go of me? Save your love for later. Let's get out of here. - Okay. - Oh, boy. You're unbelievable. The camera. Okay. Hey, wait up! We need the ghost-hunting camera. Wait up! I've changed my mind. You go ahead. Don't be scared. It's a heart with no love for you. Why would you want it? Hang on. Ploy, here. What are you doing? This could be the only way to get rid of him for good. We need to... We need to show him that we love each other. But we aren't in love anymore, no? But there's no other way. Just pretend you love me one more time. We may get out of here alive. Ploy. Please accept this limited-edition Love Never Dies pink diamond ring... Just skip that part. The vibe is totally wrong here. Hurry. Put the ring on my finger. Ready? Three, two, one. This ring... represents... represents all my love for you. Will you marry me? Whoa! Do you think I'm that stupid? You die! Ploy! - If anything were to happen to you... - No! ...I wouldn't be able to go on living. No. Even though we aren't together... No, Ploy. ...you have to live, Din. No, Ploy. Ploy! No, Ploy. Why? Why? Do you see now? My love belongs to me. I own my love. And I'll give it only to Ploy in every life. Do you get it now? Ploy. Ploy. Ploy. Love isn't about possession. Ploy... No! But it's about seeing the one we love happy. Be happy with someone. Get out. So that is love. Farewell. Don. It's gone. They're all gone. Ploy. Ploy. How is she doing? I can't wake her up. Uncle Phol, where did you come from? You thief. - Why am I a thief? - What about this? I only borrowed it without telling you. - That's stealing. - And you? Where were you all this time? I went to look for Granny Mee. And she said she didn't knock on your door. Also, I needed to poop. So I stopped by the toilet. I had the runs. Too much buffalo milk. - Because of buffalo milk? - Yes. What happened here by the way? You guys were so noisy. Please, don't ask anything now. Please help me take Ploy to the hospital first. Her breathing is so weak. Please. How? The engine just exploded. I have an idea. Moi bought a motorbike for Mee. I'll borrow it from her. Then we'll take her to the clinic. Wait here. Please hurry. A motorbike? Ploy. ONE MONTH LATER Come on, Mom. I won't die that easily. Your daughter is very strong, don't you know? I know. Since we live so far apart, don't do anything to worry me, all right? I know. Mom, next week, if they like my work and they pay me, I'll fly to Japan to see you. Well, I still need to finish up my work. Let's catch up later. I've to say your video's very entertaining. The haunted village part is such a good idea. You guys are real pros. I believed the way you're terrified. I'm sure the climax is still to come when you propose. - Are we almost there? - Yes, right after this. Even to propose to my girlfriend, I have to use a product from a client. I've tried to buy everything you wished to have. But I really couldn't afford it. I'm sorry I wasn't born with a silver spoon. I used to tell you every day that I loved you. Because I thought... you would value my words. Though I didn't expect... I didn't think you'd value them as much as bitcoins. - Why include that? - But in the end... Why not right to the proposal? This is embarrassing. In the end, it had no value at all. Sorry, I digressed for a bit. Let's just cut to the chase. Will you marry me? Din... I'm so sorry. I... I didn't... Hey. Why did you stop it? You can't just let me be hanging like this. Sorry. I... I didn't love you anymore. That's how I felt before we had to make this video. But when we got back together for the job, I realized I've been fooling myself all this time. You're the only one I feel at ease the most with. I could always be myself with you. It's all my fault. All this time, I wished to have things like others. So much that I forgot... how we were so much in love from the start. I even forgot... that I never wanted to have a big house. I could live anywhere because a home for me... was never about the place. But it's about the warmth I got from you. All this time, you took care of me. It was I who always wished for what I didn't really need. From now on, I won't pressure you anymore. Let's be in love like how we were in the beginning. I'll marry you. I promise I'll never part from you again. We'll be together forever. I won't let you go anywhere. 'Cause if you leave me, I don't think I can live. Where are you? Please come back to me. I'm right... right here. That is all. How could you do this to me? I'm so sorry. I will... We're going to make a new one for you. I love it. - Love it? - Love it? It feels so real. Yes. Ploy. How about this? I'll buy a new ring for you. This one is too expensive. I don't think I can pay for it. There's no need. Let's say it's a gift from me. You can have it. But, I'll change the diamond to this size. That big? To live up to the name, "Pet Met Peng." You're very generous. Stand up. - Thank you. - Thank you. You're very kind. Kiss. Kiss. Love wins it all. Fear may make you run. But love can make you face it again. I've been fighting for myself all this time. But its power is nothing compared with when I fought for the ones I love. So now, you need to ask yourself. Who is it that you love? Who are the ones you wish to live for? Then you'll know... you can also be one of the Marvels. If you think you are the superhero, say "U-Wah." - U-Wah. - U-Wah. Amazing. You're all amazing. Thank you for being my son. Baramee, the son of Coach Boriboon. If one day you wake up and don't see me, don't panic, all right? I'd like you to know that my love for you embraces you at all times. I have something for you too. Ta-da. A keepsake from me. It's me, your Daddy. So I'll be with you all the time. Hey, Ally. Help me. Do it yourself. Big Daddy. Oh, boy. Can you pause the live broadcast? - It's chaotic. - Pause it. It was going so well. I could even feel the energy. - You want me to take it from your mouth? - Yeah. Sure it's a good idea? Any hidden cameras? You'll make people jealous. - You naughty girl. - Let them be. - Is it good? - So sweet. Sweet? It's cheese flavor. So salty. Whatever you feed me tastes sweeter than caramel. Hey, that's great acting. I wasn't acting. It came straight from my heart. - Really? - Yeah. All right. So, it's sweet? - Here. - How about this? Let's have it in bed. - No, are you crazy? - Why crazy? I meant eat popcorn in bed. - Yeah? - Yeah. Yeah.
