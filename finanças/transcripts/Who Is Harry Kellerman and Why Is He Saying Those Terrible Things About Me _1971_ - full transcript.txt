Look at my face. Inside is worse. Midgets in there, having a picnic. Chomping on my brains. Sleep. Wear my pajamas all day just in case it comes. Like party clothes in case of an invitation. No sleep at all, Mr. Soloway? Some. Not good. - Gotta see you right away, honey. - Mr. Soloway. Mr. Soloway, your regular appointment is tomorrow. But my life is happening to me now. Sorry, your regular appointment is tomorrow. Now, doc. I gotta see you. My marbles, doc, they are spilling. They're rolling out onto the floor and behind the refrigerator where you can't get at them anymore. DR. MOSES: Very well, Mr. Soloway. - Can you be here immediately? - Beauty, baby.

[INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE] [DRUMMING AND YELLING] [DRUMMING AND YELLING FADES OUT] Hello. Hi. How are you feeling, doc? Good. Almost lost my ax today. My sweet old ax. My sweet old ax. Lot of good sounds, lot of heavy sounds come out of this ax. Sixty-one songs this year, not counting two peace marches, a cigarette commercial, four Christmas ballads, and the new Air Force hymn, cancer jingle. A lot of good songs left in this ax, right? Right, doc? Hey. Look at that. Voice of the people. How do you like that? Songs of love, Solly. Can't love anybody this year without using Georgie's words. Everybody banging to Georgie's beat. Finger on the pulse, eye on the sparrow. Everybody loving Soloway style. [CHUCKLES] Chrissake, doc, I nearly killed myself getting you that magazine. - The least you could do is-- - Mr. Soloway, you referred earlier on the telephone to an emergency, a crisis. "Mr. Soloway?" Chrissake, I mean, seven years and you're still calling me Mr. Soloway. Aren't we buddies yet? Fine, then. Now tell me what's wrong, George. Good. There's a fellow who wants to kill me, Sol. A fellow. I don't know who it is. I mean, you're not paranoid if everybody really does hate you, right? Now, we've established that I'm ready to be loved. I mean, it's years getting me ready for that number. And I'm really ready to love myself and commit myself to another human being now. And I'm really ready to love and commit myself to another human being now because I've learned to love myself and forgive myself for how rotten I am. That is where we're at, that is the scene, right? Well, that's not exactly-- I mean, it cost me $52,560, not counting cab fares, and a lot of years so you could sell me back to myself. And now I'm supposed to be straight on this love thing. And now an outside force, 2 big gun from out of town, a person, is screwing it up. You got that? Some rat calling himself Harry Kellerman is calling up every chick I see and telling lies about me, giving me the bad-mouth all over town. Sol, please, talk to me. I mean, who would hate me so much? Doc, what do you think? What should I do? I absolu-- I don't mind-- [RAY CHARLES' "DON'T TELL ME YOUR TROUBLES" PLAYING] RAY CHARLES [SINGING]: Don't tell me your troubles 1 got troubles of my own Don't tell me your troubles Just leave me alone Leave me alone Go on home Tell it to a friend 1 got troubles of my own You say your sweet love left you Well, what'd you think about me?

Doc, it is cookie-jar time. - It is time to put me in the cookie jar. - Cookie jar? I mean, the New York State cookie jar, buster. Doc, certain things-- Certain things have been happening. I mean, now the-- I see a lot of shows that aren't listed. I mean, they are not in the TV Guide, Sol. Last couple nights, I get ahold of Chomsky. We drive around in my limo. I think if I'm moving, I can sleep, see? I started thinking about King Lear last night. Old cat in the forest took him out. Shakespeare is a winner, man. Those sonnets... Jeez, the right music, I tell you, they'd all be in the top ten. King Lear, see? Alone in the forest, he looks up in the sky and he says, uh: "Oh, God, let me not be mad." Doc, I gotta know. Am I getting crazy? Help me. Help me, O Wizard, for I lie busted in the yellow brick road. Chrissake, say something, will you? Isn't this your table that wants service? [TAPPING FINGERS] Come on, Ringo, earn your 50. Calmly, George. It is clearly the Kellerman problem and the resulting lack of sleep. Your dreams seek other stages on which to play. Our attempt here, of course, must be to embrace reality, to welcome it. Why? Why should I do anything for reality? It never done nothing for me. We shall have to continue tomorrow, George. Not tomorrow, now! George, I have waiting outside for me another patient. Not yet. Give me another hour. I'll buy off your next nut. Stick with me today, there's an extra grand in it for you.

GEORGIE [WHISPERING]: Yes? RUTHIE: Georgie, where are you? I can't see you. GEORGIE: I'm under the couch. Oh. - Georgie? - Yes. Why are you under the couch? Yes, I want to explain to you about that. There's this unfortunate thing that happened. You see, this couch, Ruthie, - this is a foldout couch. - Oh. And it won't fold out. - That's the unfortunate thing. - Oh. [CREAKING] I'm trying to fix it. That's why I'm under it. [IN NORMAL VOICE] You okay? RUTHIE [IN NORMAL VOICE]: Yes, fine. Well, actually I'm cold. Oh. Well, there's a blanket on the couch. That's fine. Thank you. How's it going? GEORGIE: Well, it seems to be something with the spring. - You okay? - Yes. It's just that I was scared for a moment when-- Because when I came out of the bathroom, nobody was here. For a second, I thought you'd gone away. I didn't go away. I'm right here. [CLANGING] I'm really very sorry about this. This is a very unfortunate thing. This never happened before. - It usually just folds out. - Oh. It usually just folds right out. - Have you folded it out a lot? - Huh? The couch? Have there been people who you fold it out for? - Well, you know, I mean-- - Listen, that's all right. - People come and I fold it out. - That's all right. - That's the way it goes. - Of course. - Georgie? The ceiling is coming down. - Huh? - The ceiling is coming down. - Oh. Big chunks of it. [THUDS] That was another one. I'm really very sorry about this. This never happened before. Here comes another one. It's really coming down a lot, Georgie. I better fix this first, and then I'll come out and look at the ceiling. Okay. But it's really coming down. Georgie, really, a lot of people? Girls, I mean? Many, many? - Well, you know... - Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to ask. I was hoping not many, many. Just some. [THUDS] Uh... It's really coming down. Plaster everywhere. And I've never made love to anybody before. - Nobody? - No, not anybody. And now the ceiling is coming down, and the couch won't fold out, and I'll get pregnant. A piece of the ceiling will fall on my head and I will be dead. Ruthie, the reason why this couch doesn't fold out is because I never folded it out before. I've only slept on it alone. Alone and unfolded. I want you to know that. Ruthie, if this lovemaking thing is so terrific, then how come I fixed this couch five minutes ago, and I'm still lying here under it with my old socks? [THUDS] Georgie... Georgie, [PIANO CHORD SOUNDS] Can I come under there with you? Because I think the ceiling - is going to kill me. - Yes, of course. GEORGIE: Hello. RUTHIE: Hello. GEORGIE: Ruthie, I love you. RUTHIE: You don't have to. GEORGIE: I know I don't have to, but I do. RUTHIE: Well, that's good. Because I love you too, Georgie. GEORGIE: Forever, Ruthie? Always?

Georgie, Danny Ackerman. GEORGIE: Who? - Leon, Danny Ackerman. - Who? - Danny Ackerman. His heart, poof. GEORGIE [VOICEOVER]: Here we are, doctor, 724 Ocean Avenue, home of the brave. On the floor below us is their restaurant, Leon's Ports of Call, where occupancy by more than 42 people is dangerous, unlawful and highly unlikely. Here they are, doctor. Here they are as they have always been. My father is dreaming of a larger restaurant and my mother is reading the obituaries. My father has had trouble talking to me since the day he noticed I was taller than he was. You will notice that he talks directly to my chest, which is where my head used to be when I was 12. Georgie, look at this. Scarlatti's Cafe, Neptune Avenue. My competition. Forty tables. Can you imagine, Georgie? Can you imagine what they take in there one night, a place like that? Danny Ackerman. Leon, you know, from the Democratic Club. Oh, yeah. What about him? On his way to the airport yesterday, his heart, in the taxicab. No warning. Perfect health in a taxicab. His heart on the way to Cleveland, Ohio on business. Danny Ackerman? I don't believe it. A life is here, a life is over. GEORGIE: Pop, Ma, there are certain decisions which I have reached about not going to school to be a musicologist and-- Danny. Danny Ackerman? We just saw him. On the beach, running in place. Running, jumping, swimming. GEORGIE: And about this girl and marriage and writing songs and I-- He couldn't have been more than what? - Sixty-four. Sixty-five, tops. He was-- GEORGIE: Pops, Ma. Heh. I'll tell you why I came home this morning. - To eat. - No, Leon, it's his birthday. For what other occasion would he leave his gorgeous garret - where God knows what's going on? - His birthday? - Happy birthday, Georgie. - Nineteen years old. He's playing an out-of-tune piano in a nightclub. GEORGIE: It's not a nightclub, it's a kind of restaurant. An out-of-tune piano is a sin to the ears. - Happy birthday, Georgie. - Nineteen years old. Look at the face on that kid, the intelligence in the eyes. GEORGIE: There's something I wish to discuss with you both. Those are not 19-year-old eyes, Margot. GEORGIE: First, about school. [PHONE RINGING] What about school, Georgie? What's up? GEORGIE: Well, I wanted to tell you both together. MARGOT: Hello. Blanche? - Tell me. I got to go to the restaurant. MARGOT: Blanche, Danny Ackerman. - What is it, Georgie? MARGOT: Danny Ackerman. You know, from the Democratic Club. - You need some money? GEORGIE: No. No money, Pop. MARGOT: His heart, Blanche, on the way to Cleveland, Ohio. Yeah. - Well, what is it, Georgie? GEORGIE: Some things, some things. What is it? You got somebody pregnant? You quit school? What? GEORGIE: Yes. - Yes what? What yes? GEORGIE: Both. - Both what? GEORGIE: Both of what you just said. What did I just say? What? Oh. Oh, boy. You quit school and somebody's pregnant? GEORGIE: Right. - Oh, boy. GEORGIE: Well, I wanted to-- Don't tell your mother. She won't understand. Somebody you wanna get married to? GEORGIE: Well, I was thinking-- You don't have to. I know a doctor in New Jersey. I'll fix it. GEORGIE: Really? - Mm-hm. Both waitresses at the restaurant. They run a shuttle practically to New Jersey. GEORGIE: The thing is, I was thinking-- You tell your mother, I'll kill you. She won't understand. She lives with your Aunt Blanche on Mars. Your sister Phyllis had an abortion her last year at Hunter College. GEORGIE: I didn't know that. Phyllis? - Shh. - You tell your mother, I'll kill you. GEORGIE: Phyllis? What about school? You don't wanna be a...? - What do you call it? GEORGIE: Musicologist. No, I don't think so. - What would you like better? GEORGIE: I don't know. Writing songs, maybe. We're having dinner at Phyllis' tonight. You look funny at your sister, and I'll kill you. GEORGIE: I won't. MARGOT: Leon, Blanche wants to talk to you. Come tonight. After the dinner rush, we'll work it out. Georgie, I told Blanche to keep him on the phone. You got a girl pregnant, right? GEORGIE: Well, I-- - Garrets and nightclubs. I know a doctor in New Jersey. Don't worry. GEORGIE: Really? - He was good enough for Phyllis. - Don't worry. GEORGIE: Phyllis? Tell your father, I'll break your neck. He doesn't know the world - outside of the restaurant. GEORGIE: Okay. After he leaves for work tonight, we'll talk. Arrangements. You're young, Georgie, don't worry. Don't worry, you'll be free. GEORGIE: You okay, Ruthie? - Yeah. It's just that I thought we'd get married, Georgie. Yeah, me too. - But, see, with school and everything-- - Okay. - The thing is, when [ finish school-- - Do you love me, Georgie? Sure, I do. - Now, don't worry, there's a doctor-- - It's okay. I told my sister. She got me this doctor in New Jersey. Oh. I gotta go now. I told my sister I'd be home by supper. - She worries a lot now. - Oh. I'll be in New Jersey a couple of days, Georgie. Uh-huh. - Will you wait for me, Georgie? - Sure. - Georgie, sometimes I think-- - I can't hear you, Ruthie. I think sometimes you never got out from under that couch. GEORGIE: Hey, doc. Ruthie Tresh. Pretty, pretty Ruthie Tresh. Red hair and lime green sweaters. Heard she got married to a neurologist and lives in Forest Hills, where the sky never falls. DR. MOSES [ON RECORDING]: Hello. Good morning. How are you? This is a machine speaking to you. When you hear the machine go beep, beep, you will please leave your name, your telephone number and your message. [LINE BEEPS] Beep, beep. Right. Gotcha, doc. That's the clearest thing you've said to me in seven years. [KNOCKING ON DOOR] MARTY: Georgie. Georgie, baby. We're here. We love you. Oh, Georgie. Georgie, we're here. - We love you. Right, Lemuel? LEMUEL: Love. What are you doing here? How'd you get here? On the wings of joy, George. On the wings of joy and happiness. - Joy. - What the hell you doing here? Well, you said to come, Georgie. Your production manager called. Said you wanted to talk about a demo with my boy. What production manager? MARTY: Kellerman, he said. - Marty, go away. - Georgie, look at these contracts. - Away, Marty. Go away. Humiliation, Georgie, a hundred percent. - Marty, I want you out of here. MARTY: He doesn't like white singers. It's not your fault. Goddamn racist. White is beautiful. Marty, get out of here! Get out of here! You're crazy, Soloway. Look at you. You're crazy. He told me about you. You're crazy. [GEORGIE HUMMING] DR. MOSES: A loony bird, Mr. Soloway. A crazy, nutsy, loony bird. [GEORGIE HUMMING] Somebody. Gotta talk to somebody. Who's around, who's up, who do I know? Hey, my old buddy. Yeah. [LINE RINGS] MAN [OVER SPEAKER]: Hello. Midtown. Hey, Midtown Drugs. How the hell are you, Midtown Drugs? Oh, Mr. Soloway. Yeah. Send me an overdose of anything. What'll it be tonight, Mr. Soloway? The reason for living, some bubble bath and a comb. Mr. Soloway, we're kind of busy here. - If there's nothing I can send you-- - Uh, matter of fact, I need a shave. I could use some shaving equipment. Fine. What'll it be? Blades, razor, cream? First thing I'm gonna need is a face. You can't shave without a face. Midtown, send me a face. [BABY CRYING] GEORGIE [SINGING]: Free as the sun and moon Free as a bird Free as a bird Free as a bird in the sky Free as a cloud rolling by Hey, Gloria, come on out on the terrace. The sun is shining. It's terrific. GLORIA: I'm reading the papers, Georgie. [SINGING] Free as me rolling by What's the connection between reading the papers and not coming out on the terrace, Gloria? I'm just reading the papers, Georgie. [SINGING] Free as me rolling by In my Pontiac My Pontiac, my Pontiac What's the point of us having this big, beautiful terrace with sun pouring onto it if you're never gonna use it, Gloria? I use the terrace, Georgie. In all the time we've been here, you've never been out on the terrace. Will you tell me why is that? Just because we have a terrace, there's no reason that I have to feel obligated to that terrace to be out on it all the time. I'm not asking you to sleep on the terrace or live on the terrace, Gloria. I'm just asking you to come out and read the papers with me on it. [STRUMMING GUITAR] [SINGING] Free as a bird rolling by Gloria, I'm gonna ask you once more to come out on this terrace because I know that you will love and enjoy being on this terrace. You could probably get a nice sunburn. And I'm gonna drop the subject. [BOY CHUCKLES] GEORGIE [SINGING]: Free as me rolling by It would really be a pleasant way to spend the afternoon, Gloria, believe me. Gloria, please come out on the terrace. There's iced coffee out here for you. - Okay. Here I am. GEORGIE: Good. - Want some iced coffee? - No, thank you. Georgie, did you marry me because I was pregnant? GEORGIE: Huh? I was just in there, and I started to cry on the newspapers, and I wondered if you married me because I was pregnant. [GEORGE CHUCKLES] Chrissake, Gloria, that was ten years ago. Twelve. Did you? Twelve years ago and you're just asking me now? I always meant to ask you. Chrissake, Gloria, I mean, why all of a sudden now? Because last night, when you made love to me, you called me Sandra. And two months ago, you called me Jan. And since your making love to me is a rare enough occasion, I just wish you would at least get my name straight. Because you were in California on business for at least six months this year. And when you are here, your eyes never look into mine. And suddenly before I started to cry all over the magazine section, and I wondered if you married me because I was pregnant. I married you because I loved you, Gloria. And now? And now I got this problem. It's not you. It's nothing personal. I got this problem about time. See, it's like this house is full of time. I was sitting in there thinking about when you were playing piano at the Paradise Café. I was waiting on tables a year before you noticed me. Time keeps going by. I keep thinking how come I got two kids and I...? I feel like I'm only 18. One night we're closing up and I found you asleep on the piano bench, so I covered you up with a checkered tablecloth. It's nothing personal, see? Our kids, those goddamn kids, they keep ticking at me like clocks. When you woke up, you said: "Who are you?" And I said, "Gloria De Cecco. I've been watching you sleep.” - It's like goddamn clocks, those kids. - That was 12 years ago. And sometimes at night, I still watch you sleep. I get terrified. "Forever," you said. "Forever and always." So when you were away last month, I went to speak to Arnie. I mean, I had to talk about this to somebody. You know how he is when he listens, good old Arnie. He keeps puffing on that cigar. I talked to him all night. And then I slept with him. I don't understand how I could do that, Georgie. I started thinking I was crazy. I mean, I love being married to you. I love you. I even like laundry. What do you think, Georgie? Do you think I'm crazy? - Did you hear what I told you? - Sure. - You want some iced coffee? - No, thank you. - What would you like? - A divorce. GEORGIE: That was fast. MAN: Short and sweet. Wowee, baby. GEORGIE: A couple of seconds. Wowee, baby. Hey, listen, is this thing really legal? It's hard to believe. - Is this any good? - Sure, it's good. You betcha, baby. That's it. They stamp the old seal on there, kid, and it's over for good. That's it, baby. Forever, always, you're free. [PHONE KEYPAD BEEPING] [LINE RINGS] WOMAN [OVER SPEAKER]: Hello, 5702. Good morning.

Now, come on, you tuck yourself into a taxi, because I have to talk to Georgie. Here, come on. Come on. He's the one who wrote "Last Morning." A taxi, Samantha. Those are the yellow cars with the lights on top. Oh, Sidney. Samantha, you are very good at arriving, but you leave badly. Now, you be a good girl and I'll take you to Thailand for the weekend. Taxi. [WHISTLES] Taxi. [WHISTLES] Samantha, in New York, there are no more dragons left to slay, so I shot you a taxi. Good night and good morning. We leave for Thailand Friday.

Tell me. Where is the right combination? I shall have to screw every attractive girl within the limits of the city of New York. It's a dirty job, Georgie, but somebody's got to do it. Lovely outfit, Georgie. You look terrible. Oh, Jesus, Sid, I'm glad to see you. I gotta talk to you. I came as soon as I got your message. - Message? - Yeah. "Emergency, - crash dive, red alert." - Oh, yeah. This Kellerman thing is getting worse. SIDNEY: Don't worry, man. I figure he's doing you a service, getting rid of the losers. It's time you put together a new stable anyway. No sleep, Sid, no sleep. - Maybe I better call my doctor again. - Oh, come, you and that doc. Docs are taking over the world. Blessed are the docs for they shall inherit the meek. I know what you need, Georgie. Now, for inspiration, let us, uh, turn to the good book. - No, it ain't gonna help. - Ah, let us see what we got here. - We got Susan Sometime. - Split. - Sometime Susan never fails. - She split. She split. Now, wait a minute. Stoney Jeannie. - Stoney Joannie's on the scene. - No, not tonight. Georgie, Ping-Pong Julie. Ping-Pong Julie. - Tall, nutsy eyes. - I don't know. True love, my darling man. It's all in the book, the love book. You got the pre-dawn crazies and true love is the answer. - Let's get down to business. - I wanna talk. Chick from the audition. Did you score there? - Allison. - Right. GEORGIE: You know, she's really a lovely girl. SIDNEY: Yeah? Let me give you the word on Allison. - The chick's a grabber. - She's not. SIDNEY: Oh, I see it in her eyes. She's with the raiding party. She lies in wait for the walking wounded and grabs off the strays. But you don't know her, Sid. This one's different. Georgie, the chick's a grabber, I tell you true. But tonight, you know, I-- I've been thinking about getting older, about how much time I got coming. Georgie, listen to me. How many hits we write together? Twenty-two, babe? - Twenty-one. - Twenty-one golden beauties. Three this year alone, Georgie. This city is ours, and we're still young. We're young, Georgie. Allisons and Allisons to go. Georgie, do not make funeral arrangements until you're dead. Oh, I've seen the way these Allisons operate. It's Robespierre, man. It's the reign of terror. She's just looking to cop a basketful of heads. Sid, if they're mostly losers, when are you gonna know when a winner shows up? I mean-- SIDNEY: I am Baron von Richthofen, and I am flying over enemy territory. When I go down, it'll be an ace who gets me. I don't know, Sid. Speaking about planes, what happened to the flying Tuesday? You were supposed to give me a call. Oh, well, see, uh, Allison and me, Hook her up in the plane. - I'm sorry, I should have called. I-- - Yeah. Yeah, right. Splitting time. Quarter to four. I got some quality Swedish merchandise flying in. - Stewardess? - Yeah. Air freight. Can't be beat for speed and reliability. - Well, I won't keep you, then. - You bet you won't. GEORGIE: Okay, so long. - Hey, friend. - Yeah? Watch the skies. I repeat, watch the skies for low-flying starlings. They ruin the motor. I'll watch out, Sid. Hell you true, sir. [PHONE KEYPAD BEEPING] [PHONE DIALING] [LINE RINGING] MAN [ON RECORDING]: Hello.

This week. Aw, Georgie, to consider a venture like that you have to re-evaluate. - What? What? - Your expenses, Georgie. The planes, those incredible gifts, and, of course, the women. - You know all about me. - I get the bills. The bills, the confessions, like a priest. Please, Irwin, stay awake. - Do you have any children? - Three. 1 didn't even know you were married. Sixteen years, I never asked you. You must hate me. - What's your wife's name? - Marcia. - Would you like a drink? - No, I just got up. - Marcia. Do you love her? - Of course, yes. Do you love me? [LAUGHS] Georgie, I'm your accountant. It's not a matter of love or hate. No, wrong. Everything, it's all a matter of love and hate. What's wrong with you? Don't you understand about life?

I'll be all right soon. - We got a crazy lady here, Georgie. - Go ahead, Peter. I'll take care of it. Ronnie, why don't you give me the house lights, then you can go. - Hello. ALLISON: Hello. I feel like I just auditioned for the part of human being, and I didn't get the job. Yeah, I know what you mean. See, it took me three weeks to get this audition, and I bought a new dress, and I worked on my song. And I had my hair done. Mr. Max, 22.50, a work of art, with lashes. And now I can't leave right away. I just can't leave right away. I will just have to hang around here for a while, see? Fine. Fine. Sit where you are. Thank you. I can't move anyway. My hand is stuck on this lamp. Really physically stuck? Yeah, it happens all the time. I get stuck onto things. Chairs, coffee cups, doorknobs, people. I'll be all right soon. Just don't shake hands with me or anything. You have kind eyes. It's funny to see your face after all that darkness. It's a nervous face, but kind eyes. Really? Oh, God, I hate these auditions. I'm not what you're looking for. Heh-heh-heh. I'm not even Linda Kaiser. She's my roommate. My name is Allison Densmore. I never use it because it sounds so old, centuries old. Oh, it's... It's a nice name. It's kind of graceful. Sounds like a lot of doilies to me. It's very beautiful here with the lights on. This is-- This is a great set for Lucia di Lammermoor. Dawn on the moors. I study opera, every day an hour. You like opera? Yeah. I have them all in here. Opera is the best. People live at the top of their lives and die very beautifully. Lucia and Eduardo, they meet on this moor at dawn. She saves him, in a way, but mostly he saves her from a wild bull, and she's crazy about him, but so they save each other. [ALLISON CHUCKLING] Mister, listen to me. I'm still auditioning. All the time I think I'm auditioning. I wake up in the morning and the whole world says: "Thank you very much, Miss Densmore. That'll be enough for now." I'm crying so odd, one eye at a time. Hey, can I get you some coffee, hm? Something you'd like? No. Mostly I'd like to get my hand off this lamp. I have to go back to work soon. I'm a corporate librarian. That's a file clerk. With only three good notes, you have to back yourself up with something. Heh. Think I'll be able to get this lamp in a taxi? I'm crying from the other eye now. These-- These auditions, uh, I don't blame you. No, no. It's not the audition. It's not that. Then why are you crying? Heh-heh. It's my birthday. I'm 34 years old today, and I'm not prepared. I'm prepared for 22. Right now, I could do a great 22. I woke up this morning, and all of a sudden, I was not young. I was not old, but I'm all of a sudden not young. Sure you're young. Not young enough for this dress. Not young enough to be a corporate librarian with three good notes and a briefcase full of opera. Mister, I don't understand what happened to the time. [SNIFFS] All of a sudden, I'm going into my tenth year looking for a new apartment. I'm not much of a singer, and I'm not a gifted file clerk either. The one good thing I'm good at is being married. But my husband wasn't. That was ten years ago. [LAUGHS] I've never learned another trade. The time, mister, it's not a thief at all, like they say. It's something much sneakier. It's an embezzler, up nights, juggling the books so you don't notice anything's missing. Hey. Heh. I let go of the lamp. Heh. Yes, you did. Now I have your arm. - Yeah. - Look at that. Do you wanna let it go? Can you? I don't want to. I don't want to.

Ha-ha. BOTH: Can't go wrong singing my song [BOTH HUMMING] GEORGIE: Happy birthday. ALLISON: Thank you. You wanna sleep with me now? What about your roommate? Linda Kaiser. I made her up. She protects me. Some fellas, I have a roommate. Some, I don't. The plane, mister, is that your number? Your make-out routine? No, I usually go up alone. Sorry. Loneliness has made me a smart-ass. - Yeah, when you're alone-- - 1 didn't say alone, I said lonely. There's a difference. If we're going to bed, we better start now. It's a long trip. It's dark. Be careful not to step on my mother. She lives in the linoleum and moans all night. You make it all sound very attractive. [CHUCKLING] That's my routine. I make jokes. I make jokes because you'll be gone before I wake up, and I'm gonna miss you. - How do you know that? - Because that's the way it goes. One of the few things I know is the way it goes. Fact is, uh, I will have to leave pretty early. My work-- I know your work, mister. You're an escape artist. And if I tell you I love you, you'll leave my bed in a rocket. But I know all that. So don't worry, nothing dangerous will happen. There will be no loving. I promise you, you're safe. [ALLISON SIGHS] Thank you for my birthday. I was sitting on my fire escape this morning with my imitation citrus-flavored dietary beverage, thinking about dying. There's this man who types every morning, this woman who waters six geranium plants. They, uh... They're right across the alley. They're there every morning like the sun. And I'm thinking, "Isn't it amazing how we're all gonna die?" I mean, isn't it amazing how we keep typing and watering geraniums and buying new dishes, and we're all gonna die anyway? Then you took me up. You put the city in my hand. You're not gonna like this, but there was love in what you did. You'll leave tomorrow, but the feeling won't. And I thank you for it. This morning, I was thinking about dying, and tonight, I'm thinking about living. That's a very snappy birthday present. It's a pleasure to meet you, George. How do you do? ALLISON: Funny, this is how I first saw you. GEORGIE: What do you mean? ALLISON: In the dark. Hey, I love her. Kellerman. If he ruins this for me... Chomsky, we gotta find him tonight. [PANTING] Doctor, this tunnel... ...it doesn't seem to have an end. That is correct. So if it's all the same to you... DR. MOSES: Heh. I'm sorry, Mr. Soloway, but there's no beginning either. That will be 50 cents, please.

Pop, how are you? Fine, fine. Five o'clock. - Uh, how's the, uh, restaurant? - Closed. It's 5:00. How come you're up? I don't sleep good. How come you? I don't sleep good either.

Don't worry. A crackerjack. - Thanks, Pop. - Listen, I got terrific news for you. Last week, I put you on the menu. I got them all in there, the greats from show business, sandwiches named after them. - And now you, Georgie. - Oh, thanks, Pop. Well, what's new with you? How's business? Business is good. - You see TIME magazine this week? - TIME magazine. Yeah, terrific, Georgie, except what they had on the cover. - They put gray in your hair. - Hm? Yeah, you got some gray in there. What else is new? How's Gloria? What do you mean, how's Gloria? We were divorced five years ago. - Oh, for a second, I-- - All right, forget it. How's, uh, business with you? New places opening in the neighborhood. Cheap places, cheap food. They grab all the lunch business. Nobody cares. Plastic tables, plastic food. Across the street now, they got Eat-O-Rama. A monster, 94 tables. Can you imagine, Georgie, what they take in there, one night, a place like that? For chrissake, Pop, why don't you move, expand, get a new restaurant? You keep sending back my checks. I don't want them. What the hell's the point? Take the goddamn money. There's no point. What do you mean? Because I'm dying. I got something with the arteries. Arterio something. Makes me talk foolish. I forget things, like about Gloria. My head gets silly, I get days mixed up, sometimes years. 1 didn't know. So there's no point expanding at the present time. Pop, I'm sorry. How do you feel? Cheated. I had plans. Seems so fast. I'm very old, but it still seems fast. A finger snap. An appetizer. - Is there anything I can do? - Yeah. Queens Park Cemetery, remember the name. Terrific place. Right across the river. Terrific view. Pop, don't talk about this. I put your name on the menu. Got all the greats in there. Sandwiches named after them, the Jackie Gleason Special, Johnny Carson Salad, Sammy Davis, Merv Griffin. All of them I got in there, and now you. - Great. What am 17? - You're a triple-decker sandwich. - Beautiful, beautiful. - The Georgie Soloway Triple-Decker. Fresh thin-sliced Novy, Golden Lake sturgeon, cream cheese, chives optional, sliced Bermuda onion - Wow. - and toasted thick pumpernickel. - With a side of coleslaw? - Of course, with a side of coleslaw. - Pop, I'm immortal. - Sure.
