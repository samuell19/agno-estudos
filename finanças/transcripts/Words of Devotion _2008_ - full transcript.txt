We often feel we can?t have everything. In this sea of people. The person I care for Why is it him? There are many attractive girls around me. Also, many chances of meeting them. I ended up falling in love with someone?s whose like a brother to me. Right now time with him it?s something that can last forever. thoughts like this for him? are like a dream that won?t come true. I?ve always thought this way. ?cut class? Ootani! Yo. Did Tachibana come to school today? Uh?I brought his DVD back. Oh. We left separately this morning. I?m not sure. Oh, I see. Sorry to bother you then, can you give this to him? ?ok. Ootani-kun, you guys are really convenient. If you find one, the other one?s there too. It?s really convenient for you guys too, right? Not particularly. It?s just a roommate thing. That?s nice. I want to live with someone too. How about it, Sho-kun? Bye. Bye. What?s wrong with it? Isn?t Sho-kun?s house big? I don?t want to! Just the thought of your friends coming over? Don?t worry. I?m great at being sneaky. Thank you. It needs hot sauce. When did you buy this? This is mine. What?s wrong with it? It?s not like you?ll die or anything. Besides. What?s mine is yours and what?s yours is mine. So that DVD is still mine. Just a bit longer. I?m almost done. This guy is my roommate?Tachibana Miyako. If you introduce him this way in front of a girl they?ll definitely laugh. He says. I don?t think it?s particularly funny. But I instinctively call him by his last name. Are Sho-kun and Kitawa going out? Dunno. They?re together a lot though. Are they? What?s wrong? Nothing. They were talking about living together. Wonder if it?s going to work out. We worked out. We?re different. Just pretend. Wait a bit longer. Ok! Done! About this weekend?s plans. Yeah? How about the two of us get something good to eat this year? What? Nothing. Isn?t this a date? Then never mind. Shinya. Shut up. I?ll think about what I want to eat on my birthday. There?s something I want to talk to you about. What? You?re acting weird. Your cup. You! What did you do to my cup? This is the cup I gave you last year! That?s why-! Don?t think you can get off that easily. I already said sorry. I?ll glue it, okay? Don?t be angry! Let?s eat. Hot sauce, hot sauce? Ok. Let?s eat! I know! Geez? Itadakimasu. It?s too spicy! I?ll give you mine. My special spaghetti! I won?t forgive you! Don?t eat it all yourself! That?s too spicy! Way too spicy! Of course! You put too much! It?ll quickly be two years since we?ve started living together. Moments like these are my favorite. Ai no Kotodama You go to the next class. Don?t feel like it. Me too. Ocean! Let?s go to the ocean! Ah! You can?t be?you?re Tachibana-kun? Ootani-kun?s here too? Yuki-chan! Long time no see! Yeah. What are you guys doing here? My friend?s studying here. So you?re here for vacation? Yeah. How are you? Really good. Yuki-chan?s still really cute. I always liked saying that. You?re doing it again. This is Murikawa Kana-chan. Oh. You guys are from the same school? I?m Kana. Nice to meet you. Hi. I?m Tachibana. And this un-cute guy here is Ootani Shinya. Hi. Really, you? You guys are still together like before. Yeah. We?ve gotten used to it. You guys aren?t turning into one of those homosexuals, are you? How would that happen? You got it right. It this the first time you?ve seen a gay person? We live together now. Come and visit sometime. Shinya. You! Sorry. A place where two guys live is messy and stuff. I?ll find a place where we can get drinks. Ok. I work part time at this coffee shop around here. Come for a cup of tea sometime. I?ll definitely go. When do you work? Uh?weekend. Sorry. I already have plans. I?m leaving first. Bye. Shinya. Hey. That was a bit harsh, don?t you think? The way you acted makes people feel really bad. I?m not like other people. I can?t pretend to be happy. Don?t you still act like a little kid in front of my mom? That?s different. This is the same thing. Whatever. Wait, that?s not different at all! Think about it! They?re really cool, those two. They were your idols when you were in high school, weren?t they? You still remember? That feeling? You told me so many times! Don?t talk about me! You?re looking for a part time job around here. Are you? You?re thinking about it too much! Let?s go. It?s late. He?s always like this. Have you ever seen a Kankoro? No. Do you want to? Doesn?t matter. Look, look. (Kankoro bird sounds) It?s probably not like that. Right. I?ve made up my mind. Let?s close the shop today. Eh? I was going to say if I could see you smile, I could continue to work. That?s?impossible. 200,000 yen? I?m really hungry. Oh. You?re home. You?re early. Where are you going? Nowhere. Dinner? I was gonna go out and eat. Where? Where Yuki-chan works part time. You? Who wants to go with you? You still came. I can?t just not eat dinner. Sorry to make you wait. Ootani-kun came too! That makes me happy. He says he hasn?t eaten either. That?s weird. You guys haven?t changed at all. Where? Everybody says that. No matter what you do. If you invite one person, two always show up. That?s not true. We?re not in elementary school. Sorry. I?m in elementary school. This place?s cooking?s pretty good. Take your time. For you. The guy?s whose always invited. It?s always you. Your face is really scary. Something that annoys me about Mizusawa Yuki is probably that really easygoing attitude. She probably has a lot of friends. And she?s cute. Probably very attractive to people. It?d be better if her personality was a bit darker. Cheers! Drinking beer after working can feel this great? It really does. Shinya too. Good work. Good work. Ootani-kun. Where do you work? The ramen place up there. This guy has the same poker face in the store. Really. Ootani-kun?s cool like that, ne? Well said, very well said. She?s not wrong is she? Hit the nail on the head. Why do you always have to have that expression? You?ve been talking too much. It?s kind of nostalgic. Really. Oh. Right. Early birthday present. It?s really for me? Tachibana-kun, it?s gonna be your birthday in a couple of days, right? You still remember! Thank you! Can I open it? Of course. jealousy Does this have any meaning? Eh? No meaning! I just like the smell. If you like it, you guys can both use it. Last year?s present. Do you remember what I gave you? Huh? Lighter? I?ve always used it very lovingly. She should be a type people like. Oh. You mean Yuki-chan. She?s a good girl. That?s right. A good girl. What are you doing? Arrow? It smells like Mizusawa. She had the same perfume on today, didn?t she? I have this weird feeling. Giving your own scent to a guy. There has to be some meaning behind that. Yuki-chan isn?t that deep. She never stopped liking you in high school. Did she? Don?t try to avoid it. So? Have you guys ever gone out? Ootani Shinya-kun. Mm? Do you know how to write ?jealousy?? Of course. With a 'girl' on the side... Whatever. It?s not only girls that can get jealous. I thought Mizusawa used a different type before. Oh. Something called Tiffany. Why do you know it so well? She made me go with her to get it. Hello? Senpai! Yes. Yes. Ok! Ok. Since when? This is the first time I?ve hear about it. I got it. Bye. Why did you suddenly tell me now? What are you talking about? Tiffany. It?s because?you brought it up. Things you say out loud If there?s no need to hide it, then say it from the start. If what you say isn?t necessary, then don?t say it at all. Damn it. It has Mizusawa?s scent. Shinya. Have you ever seen this? Newest contract? Newest contract? It just says to pay two months? rent. Yeah. And there?s Fudo-san?s present. Let?s just move. This place is far away from the train station anyways. Yeah. But I really like this house. The light?s good. And there?s a nice breeze. That?s true. For a 1DK, it?s not bad. But if we do have to pick, The number?s not high enough. That?s right. Two men living in a 1DK house doesn?t sound too good. There?s only one sheet. Yeah. And we can?t call girls over. Like Mizusawa. Why are you always like this? I?ve never said anything like that before. Those rumors are true, right? I think Mizusawa wants to get back together with you. Then we?ll tell others that one of us is just a guest. At those times, men?s lies don?t work. Our relationship is something we can?t tell other people about anyways. It doesn?t matter if it?s Yuki-chan or someone else. I?ve never thought about telling them to come over. Who knows? How about we don?t live together then? Yeah. Sometimes I think that having my own house would be really nice. Are you trying to say that I sometimes disturb you? I didn?t say that. No matter if you said it or not, that?s what you mean! You think I don?t get it? Damn it! Come to my house? Yeah. I can?t? Actually, someone?s staying there now. Oh. I see. I don?t know what it is, but she says she wants to be on her own. It?s just living together but in different rooms. What happened? Get into an argument with Tachibana? ?something like that. Oh. Sorry. It?s fine. I should be the one apologizing. At least Tachibana?s probably looking for a place to stay too. I?ve been with him so long so I know that at times like these, he won?t come home. So that?s it. Only today. I only need one day. Please. Today? It has to be today? Only today. It only has to be today. I?m begging you. Today?my girlfriend?s coming over. I get it. If your girlfriend agrees, then help me out, okay? Sorry. Please. Ah? Expensive? It?s not that we really want to stay in our own rooms. In the city, 2DK, 3000 dollars?! That?s suspicious? What are you saying? Let me stay here today. Done! Fried rice ok. Go deliver it. Here. Sorry to make you wait. What were you saying earlier? Did you think about it yesterday? The new thing? What do you want to say? Ah, never mind. Press the ctrl key along with this key down here. Yup. It?s done now. Does anybody not get anything? Everyone understood everything? Next we?re going to go to page 19. Using the same method. In the city, 2DK house, 3000 dollar rent? Sorry. Isn?t that too suspicious?! You?ve drank too much! Really? It?s fine! Good work, good work. Your face is really red. No it isn?t. I?m not drunk. Can you please bring me a beer? Yes. Bring a beer? Miyako-kun?s part time job is at a liquor store, right? Yeah. Do you have a boyfriend, Yuki-chan? Why? So suddenly? Yuki-chan?s really picky? What are you talking about? Well?what about Tachibana-kun? Me? Well?I?ll leave it up to your imaginations. Ah, that?s horrible. Tachibana-kun?s being vague. You didn?t say anything either! No I didn?t! Is he by himself too? It?s fine. Wait. Quiet down a bit! It?s okay? Ah, can you hear it? Really, what?s the big deal? We?re happy! You drank too much! I said there?s nothing wrong. Happy! Yuki! I?m home! Mou?this room is? Is it okay? Can we come in now? Ah, come in! How refreshing! Beer. Can?t drink anymore. I said there?s nothing wrong. Yuki! Give me beer! Give me beer! Kana! Sleep! It?s so hot! It?s like this every time. She drinks beer and becomes really chattery. She can?t drink and talk. Though it?s because it?s nice that so she likes it. I guess so. Sit. Ah, thank you. That?s rare. It?s just you. I do have times where I want to be by myself. Did something happen? Just the usual fight. Eh?you guys can fight? Of course we can! What?s so interesting about that? After being together for a long time, you start to understand. At times like these, that guy?s probably living outside. Is he? Have some tea before you leave. Ah! Ow, ow, ow. What are you doing? Can?t you tell by looking? I got hurt. Hurt. How can you get hurt at a place like this? It?s because you came back so suddenly. Went for a drink with a bunch of research buddies. Here. Hurry up. It was my fault yesterday. Mine too. There?s still time this weekend. We can think about it if we find something suitable. I still had a question I had to think about. It was, what present to get Tachibana. What to do? What to tell Sho-kun? Tell him? I shouldn?t. What?s the point in telling him things that?ll make them fight? Really? Kitagaki isn?t my girlfriend. But don?t you guys live together? We?re just friends. She found a job today and moved out. Ah. Sho-kun! Bye bye! Bye! And, my lover?s at America. Eh? Really? Where?d you meet her? A high school in New Jersey. Oh?how cool. Sho-kun gets girls from different countries. Yeah. I just didn?t really explain it. Got a picture? Picture. Got one? Whatever. It?s fine if it?s you two. I trust that you guys won?t say anything. He?s (can?t catch the name, sorry.). I?m impressed. Should?ve we have told him that we were together then? Maybe he already noticed. Sho-kun. I still think that I?m most comfortable when I?m with you. Me too. We?ve been together for so long, so why is it still so amazing? Who knows? You?re not allowed to say ?who knows?. Say something with more meaning. What are you doing? I am meaningful. Sorry. That?s my earring. Your stuff is my stuff. You?re scary. Are you working tomorrow? Then let?s go to a planetarium. There?s no problem with that?but? Two guys going to look at stars? No. Yuki-chan too. We?ll arrange it with her. Just ask it really calmly. Why is it like this? There?s no problem with it. Everyone?s friends. And it?s on top of everything too. I can see love?s fireworks. Can you? Please look to the east. You can see three shining stars towards the east. If you connect them, you?ll see a large triangle. It?s called Summer Triangle. It?s so that you can find your horoscope in the summer. The brightest one is that one. It?s the brightest in the constellation Lyra. Vega. In Japan, Pleiades is known during Tanabata. (TN: A Japanese star festival) Now that we?ve found Orihime, let?s find Hikoboshi. (TN: The two lovers in the Tanabata legend.) Here?s Hikoboshi. It?s towards the bottom. It?s that star. That?s it. I can smell jealously coming from you two. Hikoboshi is a Scorpio. It?s called Scorpio?s Milky Way. Stop joking. The three of us have the same scent. You guys used it on purpose. I just accidentally got it from you guys. Ootani-kun doesn?t get jokes. As long as you can find Summer Triangle. Which is why I said to stop joking. Tachibana-kun. Do you have any plans for your birthday party? Haven?t thought about it. How about we have a party at my place then? Kana said she?d bake a cake. Really? How do you usually spend your birthday? I usually go get a few drinks. Ah, I forgot about it a couple of times. Then make it more special this year. Like that, huh? You forgot this. So I did leave it at your house. Thanks. Shinya. I just realized I have something to do. I?m leaving first. Wait! You guys stay. Stop acting like a little kid! I?m a little kid anyways. You?re making it really hard for Yuki-chan. Didn?t you say it?d be just us two for your birthday this year? Even if it?s that, you don?t need to have that kind of attitude! Lighter. It was the day we argued, right? You went to Mizusawa?s house? Yeah. There?s nothing between us! Kana-chan was there too. The three of us just went out for drinks. Then why did you lie to me? Did you do something suspicious? I?m wondering why you always think about things that don?t happen. What are you doing? You?ll know when you see. We have to get a new contract anyway. It?s a good time. Sorry. It?s so sudden. It?s fine. You guys argued again? I?ll find a place within two or three days. Sorry. Let me stay for a few days. You can stay for as long as you like. Thank you. Oh. So he is at Sho-kun?s place? He?s taking a shower now. What happened? We have different views. Sorry, we?ve dragged you into this too. It doesn?t matter to me. Just make up soon. It gets more complicated as time goes on. Ah. I got it. Bye bye. Aren?t you worried? Eh? Two people split up in two different places. Ah, of course I?m worried. Thank you. When two people separate Your thoughts aren?t controllable. It?s unnerving. Even when you?re close, it?s still nerve-racking. Sometimes there?s this urge to see him. Then go see him. I don?t have money. If I?m going to go, I have to stay for at least a week. I guess? dating?s a completely pointless thing. Because there?s no meaning, that?s what makes it good. Because there?s no meaning, that?s why you?re happy. Bye?Bye? Good work. (Tomorrow, at the usual long bench, 12 o?clock.) (Shinya.) Today?s been completely boring. Boss, where are you? I can?t do that either. Ah, ah, ah. Ah, it?s nothing. Sorry. Tachibana, look. Morning. Long time no see. How come you haven?t been with Ootani-kun lately? Things happened. You didn?t hear Sho-kun say anything? Ah, speaking of which, Sho-kun?s going to America next month. Maybe he?s using the break to go see his lover! Maybe. You know about it? Sho-kun?s lover? I know. Tachibana-kun?s heard about it too, right? Ootani-kun?s going with him thing? Yesterday Tachibana-kun came to the shop. He seemed really odd. He can?t hide anything. Did you argue? Did I do something to make you not happy? No. This has nothing to do with Mizusawa. It?s something between us two. Ootani-kun. Do you have someone you like? To put it plainly, you think I?m annoying. It?s a weird way of putting it, isn?t it? Every time I?m with Tachibana-kun, Ootani-kun?s always there too. Sometimes there?s a really obvious lack of interest. I wondered why. If I found you annoying I wouldn?t have gone. But I don?t think I?ve ever done anything with Ootani-kun. I?m always like this. Everyone I like doesn?t like me. Ah, what am I saying? Sorry. Don?t mind that. Sorry. I? So you do have someone you like. Oh. Is it? It is? I? It?ll probably be better if I don?t see you two anymore. Specially made birthday cake. Sorry, I can?t find a cold drink. It?s fine. I?ll be leaving soon. Is it about Ootani? I heard you?re going to America. I?m borrowing money. Shinya wants to go too? How?s that possible? It?s just that he lent me the money. What?s that about? Lying to me? You came all the way over here just for that? You and him have been together for how many years? Around four years or so. There were some breaks and setbacks in between. That?s amazing. Long distance relationship. What do you like about him? Your question?s really hard to answer. Mm? To put it simply, his stupid side. It?s hard to understand, isn?t it? Sometimes, unknowingly, there?s a feeling that a part of the heart is softer. With only a small period of time on the phone. And I can?t suppress the feeling of wanting to see him. I get that. I?m like you too, liking that guy. I like him also for the simplest of reasons. No matter if it?s good or bad, a high ego self confident, a stupid little kid. Because it?s like that, it?s easy to be hurt. But I just can?t let go of him. Though he?s not like Sho-kun?s boyfriend, To me, no matter what happens, there?s only him. So it?s like that. Ootani! I?m going to the store. Why are you standing there? Birthday cake. Though I already bought it, I was wondering when would be a good time to give it to you. I dropped it once. I don?t know if it got smashed. Look. If you want to move, buy a house here. What about this one? The house is kind of old, but it?s pretty big. No other house can compete with it. And you can call friends over. And this one. It?s close to the south train station, so it?s convenient. The rent?s a bit high, but I?ll work hard. I?ll get a part time job, so? That?s enough. Let?s go back. Hey? When did you find out? The thing with Mizusawa. Truthfully I sort of had a feeling back in high school. So you mean the jerk was me? Just a bit. Why didn?t you tell me? That?s because? I was afraid you?d be swayed. So? I?d feel really pathetic. Tachibana Miyako-kun. Can you write the word jealousy? Sorry about it. I can?t write it. Seriously? Sorry. Private tutor can?t write it. I?m not some private tutor. Just a computer teacher. Press the finger. Press the finger. So it's only on the keyboard? Please take care of this. Ok. Hello? It?s me. Ootani. If you have time As expected, she?s not coming. I guess. Start then. It?s not bad with just us two. That?s true. Ok! Mizusawa. Yuki-chan. The backdoor will attract less attention. I mean the police. It?s hot! Hot, hot, hot! It?s awesome! That?s dangerous! Now we?re entering questioning time. What? You?re the first. Yuki-chan. Do you remember the guy in the second class called Obori? Nobori? The guy who was chasing you. Was there that person? I remember! Glasses? Yeah, yeah! That guy. He always came to me looking for trouble. It was annoying. Yeah. Why did I get involved too? Sorry, you two. Ah, though I guess I shouldn?t be apologizing for that. When Yuki-chan was in high school, she was considered something of an idol. Idol? Wasn?t that you, Tachibana-kun? Me? You were always so happy and cheerful with everyone. Didn?t you know? You should have said that earlier! You should?ve said that in high school. It?s because it?s now, that I can say it. Speaking of which, when you were a senior Didn?t someone profess their love to you? You had this look like you were going to eat someone. You said something about not stringing people along. Shut up! I wasn?t like you. I?ve always been innocent. Tachibana Miyako-kun. Can you write the word innocent? Can?t write it! You?re annoying! You can?t write it? You?re an idiot. Rock, paper, scissors, shoot! Oy! You?re going up too much in one step. My legs are long. You?please always keep a childish innocence about you. How about here? Thank you. I?m really happy. Mm. Bye. Wait. This is a sincere hug. Take care. Ok. Happy birthday. Thank you. You?re not allowed to be with anyone else. You too. Drinking until now. And then the three of us set off fireworks. I sort of feel? Though it?s saying that it?s three people reflecting together it?s like I?m just sitting there, listening to the two reflect. But I still think of it this way today Actually, all the way up until now, it?s their background of being together that I?ve been chasing for. Shinya?Get out of class yet? I haven?t eaten anything today. Bring something back with you. Cutting class? Tachibana-sensei. I have a question. Is this bread really good or really bad? It?s hard? The stuff inside is good. Everything else is so-so. After this bite my saliva goes with it. And I still have to swallow it. If I swallow it, I?m going to want water. You?re the one who wanted it. My throat?s so parched its smoking. Got it?how about coffee? Maybe I drank it all. Hey. I love you. What? Mm? I?m not going to say it again. It?s your own loss if you didn?t hear it. What? Tell me? It was nothing. Hurry up and tell me! Wait for me! Oy! Those are my clothes! Your stuff is my stuff. My stuff is still my stuff. And you?re wearing my shoes. Don?t bother about me! Take it off! The future?s still far away. There?s no point in thinking about it anyways. Thinking about it won?t make everything perfect. Only? living like this everyday. That is my wish. The supposed words of devotion, do they really exist? Does what come of your mouth really become reality? It would be great, if all the words of devotion I say to you would become reality.
