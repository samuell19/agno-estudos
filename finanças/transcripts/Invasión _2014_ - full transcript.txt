- Ready. - Go ahead. I was cleaning my room. It was almost midnight. I was putting things into the drawers. I had the radio on. The broadcast was interrupted, and some American voices came on, people speaking Spanish, saying things like "Alpha," "Charlie," speaking in code. I understood right away that we had been invaded. Do you know why? Because before that, I had had a dream in which I was looking out from my balcony, and I saw an image of Jesus in the sky, very big. He looked sad, and he was shaking his head "no." And I said, "Lord! Forgive us!" But he just shook his head. "No". When I left the room, I heard, "¡ta-ta-ta!" The bombardment was a block away from my house. The shooting had started. You could see flares. You could hear planes, flying above the house. Lots of people running, crying and looking for a place to hide. I remember that sound. No Panamanian could ever forget it. The sound of the bombs falling… It was something like… I don't know where they came from, but suddenly helicopters were all above us, and it sounded… The people were shouting, "Invasion! The gringos!" And I asked, "What do they want?" "They want Noriega out!" My wife Leslie was pregnant, almost full-term, and with each bomb there was a contraction. It was incredible. Bomb, then 'urgh'! There were so many things happening in front of you. You could simply sit down in a chair, a soldier would walk by, a wounded person, people carrying 3 or 4 Betamaxes… People started walking by my house, carrying televisions, stoves, They were breaking into all the shops on 50th street. The looting had begun. I never would have imagined that these people were physically and biologically capable of carrying what they were carrying. I got to my house with a bag of sneakers. There were people who didn't dare to go into the shops, and I made it easier for them. "Give me whatever you want for that, 5, 10, 20 dollars…" And we were there as if we were at a good party. We exchanged books, "Give me that Cervantes, take this Dostoyevsky." You could say it was a very sad Christmas, but at the same time very juicy for everyone from El Chorrillo, because they had food, their Christmas dinner, and all of that. Our family story is that when Sammy was born, Noriega surrendered an hour later. It was at about four in the afternoon, or something like that. And I don't know the exact time that Noriega surrendered in the Vatican embassy, which was close by… You could hear the rock music from the hospital. There were loudspeakers directed upwards, and downwards towards the Vatican embassy. Very high-powered speakers. You could hear the music from half a mile away. I liked it, but I imagined that it was torture for him. They were the heaviest rock songs of the time, but some of them contained messages. "Bang Your Head" by Quiet Riot, "Come On Feel the Noise," which we used to listen to in those days, "Welcome to the Jungle," by Guns and Roses. I never thought he would surrender. I never thought he would surrender. I thought he would kill himself first. Because in those days, I might have done that myself. I might have done that myself. I confess that I cried in that moment. And I cried for quite a while. Because it was then that I really felt a feeling of triumph and relief at the same time. Nobody here knows exactly why the invasion happened. Was it to overthrow Noriega? No. Others think differently. How are you going to seize and destroy a country just to bring down one man? That's outrageous! It should be noted that before the invasion, first, there was a very corrupt, drug dealing, criminal dictator… Noriega… who was also involved in arms trafficking. But second, that criminal, as corrupt as he was, was supported by the CIA, the DEA, and the mastermind… George Bush Senior. Any ordinary person was nauseated by this dictatorship, but also nauseating were the US policies that made it possible. The US Congress decides not to spend more money to overthrow governments, whether they were communists or not, and then Bush, the CIA, the DEA, and any other espionage service, allowed drug dealers from Medellin and Cali, in Colombia, with Noriega as chief manager, and Coronel Oliver North as strategic manager, to send drugs to the US freely, like commercial enterprises. As simple as "half and half." Noriega began as a US agent. Then they got "divorced." The marriage didn't turn out to be very happy. Everyone has a different story about what happened. But it was very sad to see happen in your own country things that you usually see on TV. It's different when you live through them yourself. I don't understand why the invasion is not taught in schools nowadays. We're deleting topics from History, and Geography in schools. Why don't we speak about the invasion with students? You hear a lot of stupidities around that day. The date of the invasion should be a day of national mourning. Whatever the reasons, many people were killed, from this side and also from the other. But nobody cares. This background works for me too, but let's stick with this other one here. Let's go with this one. The dead over here... And the camera over there where you're standing. - How many do we have? - 9. - What's that? - To put on your finger. Scary... I could get in one if you want. - Who will film then? - Lara. OK, so let's say you're in one... One, two, three, four, five... Let's go see... Here's another person to ask. Should we ask him? We're shooting a scene of a documentary about the invasion. We're missing one person. Do you want to make some money with that? If you feel like it. Do you have some water? Yes, I have some. I have water. Did you see... Were you here during the invasion? No, I was in Cerrillo. Sorry, I meant to ask if you were in Panama. Did you see when they were picking up the dead? Yes, they were all over from 27th street to 21st street. - Were there many dead? - Yes. - How did they pick them up? - They would throw them. - Throw them? - Yes. We're not reenacting it Hollywood style. So it doesn't matter if you can tell that it's a live person. We just want the symbolism of picking them up. But you need to close them up, they look too open. OK! Ready? Everybody keep still! Action! Roberto? Do you mind if we put a microphone on you real quick? Go ahead. Where were you during the invasion? We were in a place, in a bar, and a friend of mine had come over. He came from the US for a show. He's a singer. He went to my house and gave me two tickets. Ulises? Ulises was his name. Better without the drink. It's just water. After midnight my wife arrived. I had some money and I was spending it, and she said, "Honey, let's go home, there's an invasion!" I figured my wife just didn't want me there spending money. And I said, "Go away, I'm going to spend my own money!" She said, "No, honey there's an invasion!" "I don't believe that crap!", I said. She went away crying and said, "If they kill you it's your problem." My wife left and I kept drinking. Ulises' show started. And then Enanitos Verdes were going to play. My buddy went outside because there was some noise. Then he comes over and says, "We better go home, buddy! There really is an invasion." I asked, "What are you talking about? Invasion?" Did my wife talk to you?" "No buddy, come on," he said. We left the bar and you really could see the explosions. "Look up," he said. And when I looked, I saw red, blue and black. He said to me, "Let's go home, because this is an invasion." And I was drunk and shouting, "These gringos come here to screw with us!" A buddy of mine had given me a machine gun. "Give me a machine gun, I'm going to defend Noriega!" Then I went to my house and got out the machine gun. I shouted, "I'm going to defend Noriega!" My sons grabbed me and tied me up, and said, "Dad, you're crazy." If they hadn't done that, I wouldn't be here today. - You were really going out? - Yes, I was drunk. I shouted, "I'm going to defend Noriega!" They grabbed me, tied me up, and the next day I woke up next to the bed, still tied up. After the invasion, they were looking for Noriega everywhere. The dignity battalions would come to assault and rob houses. I grabbed the machine gun, and stood out in the street. "I'll kill whoever messes with us! I don't care!" I started taking care of all the neighbors, and those same neighbors who I defended started saying that I was hiding Noriega in my house. How many people died in the invasion? Many, many people, man. There were people shot in the head, big holes like this. A father dead with his son in his arms. A whole family burned in a car. It was bad, bad… Bad, bad… I was watching everything on the street. I was a prisoner in the third gallery in La Modelo prison. Nobody except me and the prisoners could see how things really were, because regular people were hiding. It wasn't really an invasion; it was premeditated murder, with treachery and everything. They arrived at midnight, the sky filled with helicopters, planes, and all of us were watching it. People were running. After 15 minutes of the planes, they attacked the barracks. But nobody was there, maybe three men sleeping. The infantry arrived in the streets. We were up there watching the soldiers. There wasn't anyone to fight with. People were running, women, and children. And they gunned them down like nothing. Noriega was a CIA agent, folks, he had been in the hands of the CIA for many years. The whole invasion was a farce. It was planned. Because here the people were in power, and that didn't suit the Americans. So they did a mock invasion, that invasion was a circus. Not an invasion but a circus. Am I on camera now? Yes, I'm recording. I'm talking about things that I shouldn't. Well, I already said it. Fuck it! In detail? At 4:00 a.m. we broke the prison doors and got out. In all the streets we saw dead bodies torn to pieces because the tanks didn't have regular wheels, they were caterpillar tanks, and they passed over the dead bodies. The American folks brought out machines before dawn that would clean the ground and clear away all the flesh. I'd say we all presume, that it was so journalists wouldn't take photos, surely. So there wouldn't be evidence of their butchery. How many people died in the invasion? Oh, mister! Nobody has ever been able to get an exact number. In Juan Díaz they dug mass graves to throw the bodies into. Nobody got an exact number though. - Why? - Because it was a lot of people. But why couldn't they get an exact number? How are you going to calculate that? Who specializes in that sort of thing? Nobody wants to dig into that because they could become the victim of an "unfortunate accident." My film is not really about what happened during the invasion, but how it is remembered. For that reason, I won't use videos or photos from those days. But I have to show it anyway, because this is a film. So we are going to place you on the street with no make-up or fake blood, just like you are, lying down as if you were dead people. Is it raining too hard? No, come on let's do it! Let's go to war! If any of you have any suggestions, please go ahead and tell me freely. You lay down between the street and the sidewalk. The bodies were not so close, but more spread out. We'll get them spread out. Not yet. And you… Come here. Careful, kids. I need to get in here and I don't want to move the camera. Was it more or less like this? Yes, pretty much. Closer to the sidewalk, lady! There! The Lord said, "What I have received in grace I give in grace!" When they vituperate against the Gospels! My house was in a place where you could see massive fire coming from the Canal Zone to Panama City. My wife asked me, "Are those fireworks?" I said, "No, something's going on. I'm off to the hospital." When I arrived here, I learned that two corpses had come in. I asked what was going on. And someone said it was an invasion. So I said, "What's that got to do with these bodies?" They said, "It's an invasion. The Americans are invading Panama." I just kept saying, "What do you mean, "invasion?" More and more corpses kept coming in, continuously. I remember on that first night we counted more than 480. And they kept coming and coming. I estimate that there were over 800 or more. People talk about the number of dead. We wrote down the numbers. I might have missed one or two, but when I went looking for our registry book, the pages were gone. All those pages had been ripped out. But not the rest of the pages, from before, because it was a used book. It wasn't as though it were a new book. But those pages were gone. I thought, "Maybe they took them in order to keep records?" Will we ever know how many people were killed? As the Aymara saying goes, "paper talks." This is the publication, full page. The list. It appeared in all the Panamanian newspapers. So this is the first list. As of today, it's the only one that's been published. This is the result of the investigation by the Center for Strategic Studies. What's their function? Is this the type of project that the Center does? No. The Center for Strategic Studies was founded in 1990 for other purposes, and began doing this because nobody else would. The Center for Strategic Studies is the space between here and that corner! We hadn't been to Panama for some years. We arrived in Panama on the 20th of January, 1990, which was exactly one month after the invasion. The first question was, "How many deaths were there?" People talked about anywhere from 43 to 7,000. But… wait a minute! We wrote the names down in alphabetical order, with verification key words. All the dead we… identified. Harold Luna Edgar appeared in another list, as a member of the defense forces. He died of gunshot and shrapnel wounds. Roberto Rivera Castillo, died of a gunshot to the chest. We began including, crossing out, and eliminating. Let's say that this is the investigation's journal. This journal which we started at one point and continued working on, this took us a year and a half, more or less. For the Center for Strategic Studies, it doesn't matter, if it's one death or a thousand deaths. What is important here is that: first, lists existed; second, obviously the Southern Command had a list; third, the Catholic Church, the hierarchy, also had a list. But nobody has ever wanted to make it public. The diabolical concept of "collateral victims" had not yet been invented. The obvious interest was to minimize... A "surgical" intervention in Panama to abduct, and then bring to justice this tropical Saddam Hussein that Noriega was made out to be. There were planes, helicopters, flying. All over Curundu and El Chorrillo you could see fire and smoke. Towards Ancón and the rivers there were also fire and smoke because they were aiming supposedly at military headquarters. On the avenue, you could see people breaking into stores to get everything. People were shouting from the houses. Others had cooking pots in their hands and were making noise, celebrating the invasion, as if they were happy that people were getting killed. The decision we made that day was to keep on working. What happened that day... let me tell you... On the street people were selling brand-name perfumes for 5 dollars. Things from the looting. My guests went out to buy them. I sat them down and talked to them. And through that wall there a shot came. There was a tank in front of the lottery building. And later we were told that it happened because the kid in charge of the tank, who wasn't even 19, fell asleep and accidentally fired. When I heard a loud bang, I immediately got down, and then I thought, "My daughter!" When my mom saw me, I had fragments of shrapnel, like little pieces of coal all over my face. And this line here is the result of my turning at the sound of the machine gun. And that bullet, which left a sort of burn mark across my forehead, went right into the middle of Celina's forehead. At the same time another bullet hit me here. We both fell to the ground at the same time, but her brains were coming out the back of her head. She had blood here, bloody bubbles in her mouth, her eyes were going in circles, it was extremely shocking how in one second she was dead, that was it. And a bullet had gone through me, but I didn't even realize what had happened yet. I only saw a hole in my shirt, and I was thinking what to say to my mom, because she saw me walk normally. I didn't want to frighten her. I said to her, "Mom, I'm going to the hospital with Celina." She's dead." And she said, "No. Let Miller, the security guard, take her." We'll take care of you here." So I said, "Mom, please sit down." But she wouldn't sit down. We were talking and we had left this area, and gone over to the bar area over there, I said, "Mom, sit down." And she said, "No, you sit down." So I told her, "Mom, I have a hole in me too." And I showed her my back. She saw my shirt all ripped and bloody, and then she sat down. You were facing her when it happened? We were counting 25 dollars in one-dollar bills. We were on 23. Just two dollars later, and we would have been walking towards the bar. There was a wall here, the bullets came in through the wall. No, there were windows here, mom. They were 50-caliber bullets. They're this big! I don't know, when that kid fell asleep, whether the gun tilted down or up. This was the trajectory. Are you shooting a film? - A documentary about the invasion. I've got photographs I can sell you. No, thanks. - Are you Panamanian? - Yes, I am. I'll give them to you for free. They got hit by bullets from a tank over at the Soloy Hotel. I had a friend who died here. She worked here. I also got hit that day. She fell on top of me. Yes I remember her, she was a beautiful black woman. Celina, she was 23. The security guard, Miller, was there. I used to play basketball with her husband. She left a 6 year old boy. - He's a man now. - William. Thanks to the Americans… Well, many innocent people died, but also thanks to them we live in a democracy. We have to thank them for that, too. So you prefer to be governed by a gringo rather than a Panamanian? That's your choice. Well, my opinion as a Panamanian, I'm happy to eat a hamburger, and French fries. When you inform yourself and learn about what really happened. You were for the military regime. You enjoyed the military regime while poor people suffered from it. - You were baptized by a colonel. - That was only by chance. The most corrupt regime we've ever had was Noriega's. And the day he dies we'll throw a party bigger than the Grand Carnival. May that be on your conscience. We used to wash the tanks for the gringos, they would pay us four dollars for each. Like a car wash? Those same tanks they used to fire bullets at us. This was serious stuff then, the invasion came at midnight. Your belly! When we got here, we saw the soldiers were coming down with their parachutes. We thought they were Americans but they were Puerto Ricans, nationalized Americans. When they landed, they sank up to their waists in the soft mud. They would shout, "Please help me!" Do your feet get stuck or not? I see your feet! I see your feet! Then try in that low spot! In that low spot! He looks like he sank there. - You think so? - Yes, it looks good. Moises, could you please get him out? Some were shouting, but others started shooting, so we had no other choice but to shoot back at them, because it was either them or us. Did you see the people getting the soldiers out of the water? After the break of dawn, some civilians started helping them and pulling them out with ropes. They found it curious that the soldiers spoke Spanish. You're wiped out already? No, this is how the gringo laid down. They thought they could run right after landing, but they found themselves stuck in the mud. Lower down. And people started coming this way, and then the Black Hawks came, and that's when we brought one down. A Black Hawk was taken down? Yes, we got an RPG like this, and boom! It went down. - Did you do that yourself? - No. - But did you see it? - I was there. On this side there were about 20 of them, and on that side I don't know, because I wasn't there. This guy remembers it well. Then when they started pulling them out, the Black Hawks came, and we left. About how many of them did you shoot? In about half an hour it must have been around 25 of them, here, there. They came down over there. You love me I love you Wonderful woman Please make some Please make some Some coffee I'm portraying everyone's truth. Everyone has a truth. Even if that truth is a lie, I accept it anyway. I cannot be completely objective because I'm deciding what to film. I do want to let something of my personal view come through. But my main intention is to let everyone have their say, telling their own little piece of the story. If I achieve my goal, the audience will take it all in to understand what happened. They'll draw their own conclusions. Or they'll feel like investigating further. I think one of the most important parts of what you're doing is giving voice to the pain that was here. That pain hasn't really been talked about here yet. That pain was so enormous, and it was all so shameful, that some people kept all of that inside, and I feel it's important for that to come out, and for us to face it, at least. I think it's important for us to face it. It's very hard. Those who didn't support the invasion where deemed pro-Noriega, and those in favor of the invasion where pro-gringo, things were limited to those two sides of the argument, but in the middle are all the people who died, all those who suffered, all those who went through all of their tragedy in silence. There were a lot of things for which one hadn't been trained, because they took me out of a situation in which I had been doing portraits of happy brides throwing their bouquets, and girls celebrating their 15th birthdays. And all of a sudden, I'm taking pictures of dead people, from up in a helicopter. That was a lot for me up there. What did you do before? I was a studio photographer at a US military base. All the Americans who came to Panama, that needed photos for their visas or whatever… It was the only authorized place they could go to. Someone mentioned, "This is the base photographer," and it would be good if we, the Southern Command, "had material from someone trustworthy." - OK, let's start with El Chorrillo. - Yes, El Chorrillo. The idea was to get to know how precise they had been. Since the primary target was Noriega's main headquarters, we flew over that area, and they themselves were surprised at how clumsy they had been. They had missed by miles. You see that green area over there? That's where Noriega's headquarters used to be. Right there! I'll take photos so I can compare them with the ones I took that day. This building was totally destroyed. Of course, there were no roofs… None of these buildings had a roof. All this was destroyed. If the headquarters would have been in a rich neighbourhood not a single bomb would have been dropped. All the people in El Chorrillo ran to this place. There was no more room for anybody. We were packed in like sardines. I worked here when the invasion happened, and I also lived here. This is the reality of how our neighborhood ended up. Can you tell me about each one? - These are the projects. - The projects also survived. And all this here, what was it? Those were the houses on 25th, 26th and 27th. And is this the church? Over there is the church, and the nursing home. The only thing that wasn't destroyed. I suppose they were areas that were not to be touched, because everyone was taking refuge in the church. This house that's destroyed here, is where I lived. - That was your house? - Yes, that one. Were you there? Yes, I was in my house sleeping. We're going to have fire come out the window. The material that will burn inside there with the hay can simulate a fire in a house in El Chorrillo. More. Were the firemen able to do something then? No, they couldn't, because of the explosions. There was gunfire everywhere, and I suppose it was a risk. Today, if a house is on fire in El Chorrillo, the alarm sounds, and fire trucks from three stations go down there immediately because it's a neighborhood of wooden houses and fire spreads fast. - That whole structure caught fire. - Was it a wooden house? We were on a balcony that was made of cement. On what floor? On the first floor but it was high up, stores were below us. And when they told us, "Jump," I thought quickly, "Oh, god," and we just froze. And Rita said to me, "Mom, jump, jump." I said, "No," and threw the smallest one down, now he is… Oh god! Rafa is 33, right? He was small. I told him, "Jump, they'll be waiting for you below." And a man came by with a bucket, one of those metallic ones. I shouted from above, "Catch him! Catch him for me!" The man put the bucket down and I said, "Rafa, jump." And Rafa jumped. I said, "Run for the Canal Zone, run!" He ran but he was afraid because I was up here. All of a sudden my daughter-in-law came over and jumped. Then she helped a neighbor get the kids down. Just Rita and I were left, and I said, "Rita, you have to jump." "No, Mom you jump first," she said. "No, you jump first, I want to see you down there," I said. But when she jumped, she landed all sprawled out. She hit her forehead, and she fractured it. I told her to get up and run, and she said, "I can't, I can't." There was a clothesline, and I thought I would get down OK with that. I grabbed the clothesline and rolled it up like this. I was going down, but because it was so hot from the fire, my hands were sweaty. I had to hang on like that, and all of a sudden I went like this. And I wanted to go back up, and when I fell, I landed on my knees and broke my legs. And there is my daughter, blind and disabled. I was sitting in the dining room when we felt the first impact. It was a loud noise. I turned around to say to my husband, who was in the kitchen, "Did you hear that?" And right when I turned the missile came in through the apartment's roof. It impacted here, made a hole here. That wall went down. It made a big hole over here. The missile exited through the kitchen, the laundry room, and out the balcony. The missile spread its fragments. The ceiling laid all over the table. We had the key to the apartment on the table. One of the fragments from the missile landed here, where I have this scar. It threw me from the dining room to the living room. I landed in the living room and felt as though my head had exploded in pieces. I laid there on the floor. The carpet was on fire. There are fragments of the missile all over the floor as you can see. There were flames and smoke. My baby was on the floor. He was 1 month and 10 days old. Everything was dark, and when I heard my husband's voice say, "Lucy, get up!", it was a distant voice, as if I wasn't here any longer. When I realized I was alive, I started touching my son's head, my daughter's arm. I thought they were all torn to pieces. I started praying, asking the Lord to help me, to give me strength to get up. I thought everyone was dead and I was the sole survivor in all of Panama, because the helicopters were still hovering above the roof. I dragged myself and took the baby in my arms, I dragged myself downstairs, to the door. The missile's impact had split open the door, but the metal gate you saw as you came up was locked. We couldn't get out. The neighbors ran around desperately. The helicopters were still circling above us. People shouted out for help, and we were locked inside. Because the key was on the table, and the whole ceiling had come down on the table, we couldn't find it. My husband went up and down those stairs, nervously asking, "Lucy, where are the keys?" I told him I didn't know. We had one half of a broken key in the closet in the room, so I told him to get that key from the closet. My daughter came down walking, and I had my baby cuddled like this in my arms. When she saw the baby she said, "Mommy, is Isaac dead?" I didn't know if he was dead or alive because his eyes were open, his face was white, and he couldn't move. I said to her, "No he isn't dead, "but I didn't know if he was or not". My husband came down with my son Eleuterio. He had been knocked unconscious right away because one of the fragments had entered his skull, and the left side of his body was paralyzed. He came down and put my son beside me. My son Noe came down, walking, bleeding from his head and belly. There was so much blood all over, we couldn't see his wounds. My daughter Yuvisol, the eldest, came down, and when she asked about the baby, I saw that her eye was nearly out of its socket, bleeding. She said, "Mom, who did this to us?" and I said, "I don't know, the gringos." She asked why. I said, "I don't know. It's an invasion". In the midst of all this desperation, my husband running up and downstairs, one of the neighbors saw us and we were able to get through the broken door, but the metal gate was still locked. And then we managed to give the piece of key from the closet to the neighbor and that was a great miracle, because iron doesn't stick to iron, and she was able to turn the lock and get the gate open. Devils are an allegorical fantasy, a magical view of Good and Evil. The fight between Good and Evil. I went to El Chorrillo with a bunch of foreign journalists. People were dying there, people picking up body parts. It was horrifying! There were hundreds of black plastic bags. Something was happening there. Death was there. But when you moved elsewhere, because it was Christmas time, and you went to the Cathedral Plaza, all of a sudden there, you could see general looting. You could see people with millions of things. Like, for example... Blue chiffon dresses, items with the tags still on them. Because such a thing costs 300 dollars, women would wear them. A woman from the neighborhood couldn't pay 300, but she could wear it. And you could see the tanks with the machine guns, and people saying, "Go to sleep!" and I don't know what… And people with beers, partying. That was all part of the scene in Panama. Put it on your back. Put it on your back. How far do you need it? If you don't pick it up, then it's not possible. You have to walk at least 30 to 65 ft. - 30 to 65 ft.? - Yes. It slides down. Scott says that nobody would do that… They didn't tie it with anything, they just grabbed it. How did they carry it? Up, up! And there he goes with his fridge. - Can you manage like that? - Yes. That's the way to go. We're filming a documentary about the invasion and the looting. Is that what it looked like? You shouldn't be doing that. People have suffered a lot, and now you're going to stir those ashes again? That's just not right. But it's a topic that needs to be discussed. You see it from your point of view. But I see it from mine. OK, I respect that. Sorry for the inconvenience, but this has already been forgotten. The invasion… Take it. This was the first jewelry store. Remember those guys with rifles who wouldn't let anybody in until after they were done with the place? Their people took out all the gold and wouldn't let us in until they were gone. When they left, that's when we were able to come in. There were people lying dead on the floor right here, you know. Some people were wounded, slashed by glass, because they were desperate to get into the jewelry stores. They would break store windows and get cut. This is where most of the real bad guys lived. They called it the Big House back then… And after the invasion it was named 'The Vatican Embassy' because all the criminals would go there, just like Noriega went to the Vatican embassy. A friend of mine, a servant of God today, a great pastor named Danilo, he went in there to that hostel and went all the way up to the place where you pay to get in, and showed the girl a grenade and demanded the money. That grenade had come from the officer's club over there, he had no money so he went in there and said, "If you don't hand over the money, I'll blow you away." I was standing right over here; I had come with him. He told me to wait here and went inside and showed that grenade, and the girl gave him all the money, and we left. Also, over here was the hat shop. Everyone ended up wearing a hat during the invasion. Remember the leather ones, in different colors? And with the little buckles and stuff? The dignity battalions started the looting. They'd even kill you if you didn't give them a case of whatever you had. They'd put a bullet through you. If you were driving a car full of merchandise, they'd stop you and, just like in Africa… They'd say, "Do you want the merchandise or your life?" People would give it up, of course. You had to leave. I grew up there. This used to be the National Post Office. We played here when we were kids. This is El Chorrillito. The presidential chair appeared here, near El Chorrillito. How did it get there? They left it there when they were looting the Presidential Palace. They took everything. Even the herons! Yes! A guy called Duck Butt. This used to be the Supreme Court of Justice. This is where they would judge and sentence those who came in for murder, right here in Panama. You still can read the letters: "Justice And Law." This is where we stocked up on weapons to go out to the streets and do some mean stuff. We went into the evidence room, in the right wing of the building. There were plenty of knives. In those days knives were popular. It was common in '87, '88. People would kill each other with machetes. Nobody had firearms up until after '89. From the time of the invasion on, shootings started. Men began killing each other, feeling stronger because of guns. There's a saying, "With guns, no one's afraid of anyone." You can't say anything, not even to a little kid. Years ago you could scold him, give him a slap on the head and kick his ass. If you do that to a kid now, he gets a gun and kills you. Does this place resemble the place where this happened? - Hell, yes, it's identical! - Does that dog bite? Out! Out! Remember how they had the presidential chair? Those guys who sat on it and smoked? That's what we want you to do. Get into the mood and do it on film. Maybe you should get a close up of what he's doing here. The presidential chair of 1989. The same presidential chair. Attention! Salute! Attention! What are you interested in? I'm interested in the place where things happened. Well, everything was over there. If you could please start walking that way. But please don't laugh. Just pretend we're not shooting now. Every morning we had to go jogging around the city and we sang, "Here comes the Dignity Battalion!" We ran a lot. They made us go all the way to the Bridge of the Americas. So they had us all in shape. We also trained with weapons, crawling on the ground… Basic training. They would take us to the jungle. But in the end, none of this served any purpose. Did you learn how to shoot? The weapons they gave us shot blanks only, and they would tell us how to use them, but we never grabbed a real one. "Ta-ka-ta-ka!"… What were your orders? What were you supposed to do in case of an invasion? Major Dominguez had told us that we would be what you call… What was it?… "Urban guerrillas"! So I asked him, "But, Major, where are the weapons?" I was still young and had faith in Latin liberation. He smiled and said, "We'll have the weapons at headquarters." We didn't realize the absurdity of waiting until after the invasion and then go looking for weapons! That's why we got massacred. Dignity Battalion "Rufina Alfaro" is present! Whoever doesn't jump is a gringo! Whoever doesn't jump is a gringo! We knew it was impossible to beat the U.S. Impossible. We were young and we thought that we would give our lives for Panama. But it wasn't like that. Homeland or death! It's completely different today from how it was 24 years ago. 24 years ago, if you told me that I was going to speak to Colamarco, I'd have died of fright. The very head of the Dignity Battalions. Here we see an area that's completely different from how it was in 1989. In Panama there were about 8,000 to 10,000 American Soldiers on the military bases of the former Canal Zone. And 32,000 more came to the bases here for the invasion. Troops and war materiel came from the US for the invasion. But actually, all they had to do was cross the street. From this street, it was Panama. US military bases were on the other side of the street. It was Panamanian land, but according to treaties, it was US territory. One day, General Noriega walked from Building 8. Building 8 was that one. You could film it. It was empty the day of the invasion. Same as the Support Building, because it was an administrative facility. Also the mess hall. One day, General Noriega walked from Building 8 alone, with no bodyguards. He just walked through here, straight to the US Navy Command building. Now the ARI building is there. You could film it. There was a mango tree. He picks up a mango and starts eating it in front of the US Navy building. Of course, there was military protocol. The soldiers at the entrance had to salute him formally. And that's on film. This was Building 8, one of the headquarters offices. I learned from my mistakes. I knew how to apologize when I had to. We all make mistakes, but I don't regret being a nationalist, or anti-imperialist. I have no regrets for defending the integrity of my land. Based on those values that I treasure in my heart… I was locked in jail for four years, physically, but I was mentally free, with my values and principles intact. Obviously, there were mistakes. And one should apologize for those mistakes. I have apologized many, many times. But we have to put each thing in its proper perspective. I say it from the bottom of my heart, to you and to my children, who know this story and this fight. And I also say it to the relatives of the dead, who were my partners, and who should not be treated as if they were nothing. Stop. This part of the story is important. No one speaks about it. Let's continue. OK. It's important because here it seems like the people who died don't matter. Nobody seems to remember. I can give you names, because they were with me. Angel Benitez. Manuel Carol. Alejandro Hubart. Listen. The only body that was found… They drove to the Bridge of The Americas and Avenue "A", as we drove to Balboa Police Station… The only body that was found was that of Angel Benitez. Alejandro Hubart and Manuel Carol's are still missing. Some say they were buried in Honduras, at a US military base, I don't know its name. Bodies recovered in Panama were buried in Honduras. In the morgue of Santo Tomas Hospital they snatched all records of the killed and the wounded. This happened here in Panama. In 1989 I was head of the Locks Division. The military visited us often to do operations. Months earlier I had to help discharge military equipment at this very lock. We ought to remember that at the time, the canal was under US administration, under General McAuliff. He could stay until the 31st of December 1989. From January onwards a Panamanian administrator would take over, and there was a swap of positions. From your point of view, are the Panama Canal and the invasion related? Some say the US did not want to give the Canal or the Canal Zone to a government like Noriega's. We lived from day to day and didn't think that. There was already a relationship with the US… It had to do with Noriega being involved in drugs and so on, which was contrary to us, the rest of Panamanians… I mean, we knew there was a lot of corruption. We knew that Noriega's participation in that was for real. But we did not agree with that sort of oppressive regime. We never wanted an invasion. We didn't think it was the way to solve the problem. But it seems that options ran out at some point. The good thing is that since then we've had democracy and have seen a lot of progress during this time. And during this time, little by little, we're leaving that all behind. Where are you from? Germany. Welcome. What are you doing? A documentary about the Panama invasion. Did you hear about that? No. It was in 1989. The US invasion of Panama. Ah, yes. Do they teach about that in Germany? I'm curious. Never heard about that. Really? It was about the same time as the fall of the Berlin wall. Can I ask you all a question? How old are you all? 18. 37. 21. What do you know about the invasion? I have no idea. The invasion… Are you Panamanians? Yes, we're Panamanians. They spoke to me about the invasion, but they didn't give me much information. My suitcase! They were looking for Noriega or something like that. We'll be right back after this commercial break. Time Magazine wrote that Panamanian communists were so well organized that they had red T-shirts with numbers on the back. Those were firemen! Panama did a good job in making them believe that we were so well organized, with the Dignity Battalions, and the Popular Army… That idea was given to us by the Cubans, by Fidel Castro. "The only way to avoid an invasion is through a civilian paramilitary. The US knows how to fight an army, but not urban guerrillas." But our guerrillas were useless. It's 6:41. We now read from the newspaper "Crítica." On Monday the 19th, there was a concert at a bar called Las Malvinas, on 50th street. Ulises was performing, and he was married to Marcela Tason, the General's secretary. There was also a band from Venezuela called Los Buitres, who imitated The Beatles. It was Roberto Durán who stepped outside of Las Malvinas and came back to tell us, "The invasion has started, let's go." Everyone went their own way. I went home. When I was at home, Rubén Darío Murgas came by. He was my partner on a morning radio show. He decided to try to walk to the National Radio station at the General Accounting Office Building. I said, "You're crazy." I won't go there, not on foot." But every officer in the defense forces knew where National Radio was. That's why he wanted to go. They began giving messages of unity, solidarity, resistance. And we began to lie, to tell you the truth. We said that Colombian revolutionary forces were coming, and also from Nicaragua, that Panamanian forces were dominating US forces in Clayton. All false, of course. How long was it before they repaired the eighth floor? A year and a half. The Americans left it like that for a year and a half. - Destroyed? - Yes. We saw when a helicopter landed on the building roof at the General Accounting Office, where the antenna was. Some soldiers rappelled down and blew up the antenna. I called Rubén and said, "you better come here. Now." - I've never been back until today. - Really? My office was there. There was the office of the chief news editor. The recording studios were there. And here, the operations center. When did the explosion happen? Incredibly, Abner, it happened when the US forces heard Noriega speaking with me on the air. Right at that moment they blew this up. The first thing they did was to fire an incendiary rocket here. It came through that window and destroyed the broadcasting equipment. When the General called on Saturday morning, we told him, This is it; it's all over. There is no coordination with resistance forces, no communication with your General Staff. "We recommend that you seek refuge." He considered the Cuban embassy. I said, "No, it's surrounded by the gringos." Then he asked about the Nicaraguan embassy. I said that that was even worse. Then we said, "General, why not the Vatican embassy?" He didn't trust the Papal Nuncio. The Papal Nuncio was a friend of the US, and Noriega didn't trust him. Since this is a people who respect, in a certain sense, freedom of speech, they know that destroying a radio station is not something that will fill them with pride. What they did here at the National Radio station they also did, though differently, in Iraq and in some other invasions. Noriega's home? All the Canadians go visit it. You can go inside. It's by the beach. It says "Private Property", but everybody enters. You gotta wear shoes, there's a lot of glass. It's pretty spectacular. NO TRESPASSING UNDER PENALTY OF FINE AND ARREST COME IN This is Casa Noriega. The house of Noriega. Before it was absolutely beautiful. Before... very beautiful. You see? There's people in the house. There's always people. The first time I came to this place was in 2004. This was a bar. And there was lots of wood. It was beautiful. Then you'd come out here. That was a bathroom, obviously. Look how big it is. You can see the ocean. As you can see, it's all metal. And this is wood. There used to be reeling, but everybody just robbed everything. Yeah. Anyway. - Coming up? - Yeah. I swear to God this was like a dome. All a big mount of glass. It was beautiful. Noriega's island. You can see the caves that go through the island. There's three of them. I jet-skied through one of them. They say that... the people that... that worked for him, if they didn't do what they were supposed to do, he used to chain them in, wait for the tide to come up, and they were shark bait. But that's rumors. I don't know. Who are you? Like a star You lit up my way I, who was wandering through life With no destination. I was a singer, married to his secretary. I would go in and out of the country all the time. That Christmas I had a show at Las Malvinas club. I had brought a group with me from Venezuela, Los Buitres. Las Malvinas was right behind there. - So that's the bar you were at? - Yes. And that's where the invasion got you? Were you singing, in the middle of a set? Yes, I was on my third or fourth song. "They're searching for Noriega house to house," they said. Time passed, and I didn't see anything happening at all. Something from God came to my head, and I said to Marcela, "Tell your boss that I'll take him." But to be going around with a general who had a million-dollar bounty on his head, and who the US army was looking for, you must have had nerves of steel. - Well, our Lord protects me. I always say, if something is going to happen to you, it'll happen. If not, it won't. When it comes for you, you cannot move aside. The bodyguard was just to my right, and Noriega was in the back, lying on the car floor, covered with a tarp we had. And how did you choose the location? The place belonged to an old friend of mine. So I took a chance. It was a little house like this one, but it wasn't painted or any of that. This was a dirt road. - A little house similar to that one? - Yes. And at nightfall, I opened the door and I told the bodyguard to get out first. He entered, and afterwards the general followed. This is where we spent the four nights. I think he never thought the US would invade Panama. So there was no plan B, no plan C, maybe there wasn't even a Plan A. I always thought he had an ace up his sleeve. I'd say to him, "You must have another option, rather than getting caught and going to prison." He wouldn't answer. He only took notes. I remember that he took notes on a little paper. He was always taking notes. I never saw them. There was a pay phone around here and I would go and call Marcela, who would contact Mario Rognoni. He was our contact to finally hook up with the Vatican people. At the Dairy Queen parking lot. This is incredible, I don't even recognize the place. I got thirsty and stopped at a bar and got me two pints of beer. The general was worried because I wanted to drink a beer, but I told him, "Don't worry." And I kept on driving up and down Via España, until I saw the Vatican embassy car. I think we had said two o'clock p.m. and they got there 20 minutes late. So I parked and I told him they were there. I parked the car hood to hood. - What did you call Noriega? - Boss. So I told him there was a military man driving the Vatican embassy car. He asked me who it was. I told him... what was his name... - I think it was Donadío. - It was Donadío. He said that guy is all right. So I said, "It's time to get out of the car." And we got armed just in case of any event. And he went to the back seat of their car. - Did he take his weapon? - Yes. - What kind of weapon was it? - A machine gun. So... He had it covered with a newspaper. No, with a jacket. Careful. So... We said goodbye, and I followed the Vatican's car up to Panama Viejo. Then I went my own way, and he continued on to the Vatican embassy. When I was told that he was on his way, I opened the door and I saw him. He stepped out of the car and went inside the Vatican embassy. The first thing, I remember, he asked for… He got inside quickly. He wore a jacket and a cap. And the first thing he asked for was a beer. There was no clothing for him to wear here, he's a relatively small man. I went to my place which was close by, I got more provisions, and clothing for him. The first clothes he wore were my sister's. Because she was smaller. When it was learned he was at the Vatican embassy, when they knew he was inside, they stationed themselves there. And as everybody knows, they played loud rock music as psychological torture. Say this is the Vatican embassy here, we lived right over here very near, and over here was a tank. We then made contact with this person I wanted to tell you about. Who was it? It was one of the soldiers from that war tank. He was blonde, white, blue eyes… We waved at each other, time went by, he kept looking at us, and we invited him up to our apartment to eat. He said he couldn't then, but he could come up at night, at around nine. And at that time, he indeed came up. On his own, he took the elevator up, with no escort, alone, trusting he would be fine. He came up to the apartment door, rang the bell, we opened the door and there he was, wearing a helmet, military fatigues and his huge weapon. That was an impressive image, to see him in the door frame like that, a man all dressed out for war, accepting our invitation. He came in, sat down in the living room. We talked for a while, we shared, we made him see how happy we were and how truly grateful we were for the invasion, for them liberating us from the difficult times we were going through in Panama. And then we prepared a T-bone steak. I remember we had it tucked away in the freezer, waiting for a special occasion. We took it out, cooked it, and he ate it. He ate alone at the table. We were looking at him, talking to him. And he ate happily. US soldiers were posted at those doors. They could not enter Vatican property. They had invaded Panama, but this was Vatican property. Two years before, Pope John Paul II had said to the youth in Argentina very categorically: "The soul is smothered as much by communism as by consumerism." It was the first time I heard such a comparison, equating both things. Were you a volunteer here when Noriega arrived? I was a friend of the Nuncio. This was the room I slept in, in the corner. Those were the buildings from where people shouted obscenities. They thought I was Noriega's assistant. People were very angry at that time. This was Noriega's room. And if you see here in front there is a parking lot that is very important. That was the psychological pressure he faced all the time, that soldier stationed there 24 hours a day, like a statue. And to top it all off, the bed was facing that soldier. So he had the curtains shut, and he had a TV over to the side. I remember he was watching kids ice skating at Rockefeller Center in New York. Trying to make conversation with him, I said: "Wow, what a contrast," those kids skating at Rockefeller Center "while here we are in this situation." And he said to me, "Definitely. We're all molecules." That phrase stuck with me, I even wrote it down. This looks smaller now. I think on New Year's Eve he already had made up his mind. That night we were in this dinning room. He was very downhearted while the others present were very happy. His body language said everything. A call came in from the Vatican around midnight or 1:00 a.m. We were eating at the time and the Nuncio left the table. So it would seem that negotiations were happening around the clock. It was New Year's Eve, and almost 1 a.m., and when the Nuncio left the room to receive the call, Noriega picked up a wine glass, and put out the candle in front of him. It was a long dining table with many candles. He picked up his glass, snuffed out the flame with it and set the glass down again. That says it all about his state at the moment. The Nuncio gave us the task of instilling as much fear as possible in those staying in asylum here. We were to say there was a big demonstration the next day, and tell them about what happened to Mussolini, about how he was lynched by the masses and hanged from a tree. So we needed to apply some pressure to them. And that demonstration was about pressure, as though to say, "If the gringos leave, then the people in the street will enter the Vatican embassy." They had called for the demonstration, and there were crowds nearby, shouting, threatening to jump the barricade to come and lynch Noriega. Monsignor Laboa says to me, "General Noriega wants to ask you a question." He asked, "What's it like in the street?" I said, "It's unsettled." So he said, "What would you do?" So I said: "Listen, if the gringos let them cross the barricade", first the nuns, then Joseph, then Monsignor Laboa and myself, we would all face them before they catch you. "But it'll definitely be a blood bath." I didn't know why he asked that question. But at that moment he said "I'm going to get dressed." That was one of the most emotional moments I've ever had. People came out of every corner of the house. Without anyone telling anyone else what to do, a sort of improvised honor guard formed from the bottom of the stairs, all the way upstairs, all the way to his door. Monsignor took me by the hand and said to me, "You need to be witness, as the only Panamanian civilian here," that General Noriega "is turning himself in voluntarily to the US forces." At that moment, I looked back and he was coming down the stairs. It was impressive to see how the nuns, and the ETA members, were crying. I could understand that his friends and comrades might do so, but these people had no relationship with him, and they were in tears. It was an extremely solemn moment. I think it was also a moment of relief. You could see that this person, who was said to be so evil, who was said to be the cause of all this… To see that it was all over… I imagine that when people saw Marie Antoinette being led to the gallows, they must have felt something similar. Your human side betrays you and you feel empathy. We escorted him. The Secretary in the lead, Monsignor Laboa stayed at the door. The Vatican embassy secretary walked first, then Noriega, then Father Villanueva and then I. And we took him outside to the gates. And I tell you that the Americans must have known what was going on because the doors had barely opened when what was like an electrical storm begun with all the flashes from cameras in all of the buildings around. So the Americans grabbed him and began wrapping him in masking tape. With masking tape. And I said, "No mistreatment. There's no need for violence!" I was afraid that things would get out of control, that he might try to come back and get his head beaten against the bars of the gate. It was my instinct. And that was his surrender. Here you can see him. He's wearing a Panama football team uniform. How long has he been in jail? It's been 23 years now. Twenty in Miami, two in France, and now one year in Panama. An eternity! I had thought that when I went to the jail to talk to Noriega, I would leave thinking about what Noriega had done, about the dictator he'd been: was he good, was he bad? But when I left, the only thought I had was, "23 years in jail…" Are you going to interview him? That's the reason I went, but he doesn't want to be on camera. I might only use audio. - Let's go to the shade. - OK. Time is like summer leaves. They fall, and fall until they cover up everything on the ground. That's what has happened here. The invasion… and its aftermath are being forgotten. There's a new generation of people who don't know about it. There's a new generation who are not told about it, who are misled about it, prevented from knowing about it. So, no one remembers the invasion.
