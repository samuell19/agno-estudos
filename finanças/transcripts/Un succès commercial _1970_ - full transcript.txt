START CINAK PRESENTS A revolution mustn't start where others have ended nor end where others start. But must a revolution be political? Or sexual? Or both at the time? You understand?! SO CINAK PRESENTS A COMMERCIAL SUCCESS A NATIONALIST TRAGEDY AND A UNIVERSAL COMEDY We wish to thank Suzanne Olivier, Yvon Malette, Pierre Hébert, the Conseil québécois pour la diffusion du cinéma and the Galerie Place Royale Only...

On November 8th, 1969, when the following sequence was shot, the following people occupied the following positions: Pierre Elliott Trudeau, Prime Minister of Canada, Liberal Party. Jean-Jacques Bertrand, Prime Minister of Québec, Union Nationale. Jean Drapeau, Mayor of Montréal. Richard Nixon, President of the United States. There's nothing fictitious about those persons. Even though their names will soon belong to the small or big fiction of history. If I name them, it's to remind you that those men speak and act on your behalf. It's also to remind you that you make them live and let them survive or you will kill them. So it is with porn movies. Let's recall finally the result of last night's demonstration on November 7th, organized to protest against the growing climate of political repression in Québec and to demand the liberation of Pierre Vallières and Charles Gagnon, the resignation of Québec's Minister of Justice, Rémi Paul, and the withdrawal of Bill 63 Some 2,500 took part in this demonstration. The police, numbering more than 1,000, could watch the comings and goings of the demonstrators through closed circuit television. Some ten Molotov cocktails were launched. Few arrests were made. PERSONAL FILE Note... From yesterday, today and tomorrow, every guilty person will be punished and the punished ones will be guilty till the end of their life. No man, no woman will escape from the destiny of any political movement: left, right, center, back or front. Revolution and anti-revolution, morality and immorality, decency and indecency, photography and pornography, censor and anticensor, God and Satan, living dead and stillborn, politicians and drunkards, homosexuals and lesbians, cats and rats, clowns and bleeding hearts, officials and hippies, nothing nor anyone will escape from the power of opposites, from the politico-erotic split of cosmic instinct. That's all. From yesterday, today and tomorrow, every guilty person will be punished and the punished ones will be guilty till the end of their life.

Here's Canada. Canada: second widest country, with 3.8 millions square miles, It's the world's second largest country, more than half of the North American continent, with five important geographic regions. Because the French Canadians have retained their language and traditions after the conquest of Quebec by the English, French Canada has a particular cultural life. Most of the French Canadians live in Quebec. The English-speaking population has grown through immigration British and American immigration did that more than 3.5 millions of Canadians today are descendants of Scotch and Irish. Many are descendants of the first American settlers who came to Canada during the American revolution. In the beginning, Canada was inhabited by Asiatic tribes which could have crossed the Bering Strait some few thousand years ago. The Eskimos and the Indians are descendants of them. The name “Canada" probably dates back to those first inhabitants. The Hurons-Iroquois used the word "Kanata" to signify a colony. The true founder and colonizer of French Canada, Samuel de Champlain, was impressed by the quality of the furs exchanged with kind Indians. From 1604 to 1634, he established small colonies of French pioneers. The first attempts by the English to found colonies date back to 1628. Canada has parliamentary government since British North America Act in 1867 which declares that Canada will have one parliament composed of the Queen, the Senate, and the House of Commons. Prologue #1. God created woman. Man invented the key. From this day the doors multiplied. And came cinema, inventing the key hole. Prologue #2. CANADIAN OCEAN My name is Q-Bec. I am 434 years old. I was discovered in 1535. In 1608, Samuel de Champlain, after seeing my Diamond Cape, lands on me and clears a part of my virgin forest. In Indian, my name means "narrow passage''. One day, Samuel told me... One day, Samuel told me... The conversion of an unbeliever! - "The conversion of an unbeliever is by far better than the conquest of an empire." That's how he killed two birds with one stone, establishing God's empire through conversion. However, Champlain enters me more and more and sails the Ottawa River up to Ottawa, the capital of Canada. Left alone by my lover, I welcome missionaries, trappers and Indians. In 1642, I move to Ville-Marie with de Maisonneuve, who said that now famous word: "If all the trees of Montreal should become women, it is an obligation for me to fecundate a colony, and I will." For a while, nothing special: new explorations, widening of the territory... I have to wait till 1690, to feel new sensations when Admiral Phipps tries to rape me. But Frontenac is there ready to shoot. However, in 1759, what was up came down, while my drill-ground of Abraham was bleeding. Then, after my Lower and Upper Canada, I underwent a hysterectomy in 1867. Result: the birth of the assembly of fools. Little by little, I spread from an ocean to the other. I fool around with anybody, anytime, always, as long as it pays, with the communists, the fascists, the imperialists, and the English Canadians. SEA OF SARCASMS Only humour isn't pornographic.

Quebec to Quebecers. Me. They're all stuck together. Quebec to Quebecers. EPISODES OF A NATIONALIST LIFE My name is Jean-Baptiste Bilingual. I have no age. And you want to know what I'm fed up. Here or elsewhere, who cares, it's the same fuckin' thing. Everything's the same. Some fuck, others watch them. Some make laws, and others suffer. I'll tell you all about it and smack it right into your face. And don't you try to tell me how to speak. or that I won't be understood in gay Paree Don't you fuckin' try, you bugger, to tell me I swear, that it's ugly and that I will be censured for Christ's sake. I'm not drunk and we're just alike. My shit! I'm tired of shitting my shit and smellin' it. Who cares about Quebec and more about Canada? I'm overtired of bein' a man. I want to be me. End of the monologue. Q-Bec B.B.Q. $1.84. Have a beautiful breast, be well shaped, desirable, sexy. Develop an amazing breast size. You want to be like Hollywood stars? Don't be shy. Lose your inferiority complex for ever. Be a woman. Imagine, in your own home, few minutes a day will bring you fabulous results in no time. Send only a dollar and obtain the most gorgeous bust. All sizes available. No doubt, Quebec's chicken made in Quebec by Quebecers and eaten by Quebecers... It's the best. Don't worry baby one of these days we'll have our own B.B.Q., for Christ's sake. National Union objectives. Quebec's Liberal Party political program: Quebec on the go. Worried about all the workers troubles. ...spread disorder and confusion and enable all Quebecers to earn an honourable... ...cultural and artistic living. Problems are multiplying. They result mainly from the Liberal regime's feverish haste to implement plans... ...for culture, the obligation for theatre or concert companies, with the cooperation of the State, to offer the public tickets at popular prices. We can thus present quality shows... Of course, there are a few centres in Québec where we find cultural activities. Some regions also maintain at a decent level the productivity of their handicraft. and some traditional arts. But because of the isolated character of such activities... ...facilitate the development of film creation and production. We're intensifying our policy of purchase of works of art and subsidies to artists. For artists we'll fix up centres for meetings and symposiums... ...is unfortunately far from being radiant enough all over our territory, and it should be much more influential outside our borders. Like the dairy industry supplies... ...the majority of the population to live in French wherever on the Québec territory. Measures will be taken to give Québec a French face and the French language the priority it should have in the administration and public services. That's enough. Come to bed. You don't dream. I'm sleepy, for Christ's sake. Come on to bed. Naturally, I'm no playmate. Naturally, I don't look like USA. Come on to bed, Christ. Go to hell. IS IT TOO LATE TO DREAM?! Women, men, you all, myself, you, us, us all, from here or elsewhere, I dream of telling you a dreamy speech. I dream of telling you a dream. I dream to see you dream. Listen to the silence of the light that brings me birth. Listen to the silence of the galaxies. Look at me! Look at you! Look at us! You don't understand what's going on. We don't and they don't. This time, I won't show you my arse. I want you to look inside of me. I want you to imagine that I may suffer. I may have cancer. I may soon die before the end of this shot... before the end of this film, who knows! My arse, your arse, his arse, our arse, your arse, their arse... And still you make war! You kill! You're killed! You're without a job! You suffer! And still you're the slaves of dealers, bankers, politicians, bishops, publicity, films... And still you let it be, you let yourself buy, humiliate, exploit. But you have color TV and a brand new car. But still, you're the only one responsible for what's happening or not happening. A nobody-country has always the politicians, priests, pornographers and terrorists it deserves. I repeat: A nobody-country has always the politicians, priests, pornographers and terrorists it deserves. Women, men, of yesterday, today, tomorrow, we have no more time to split around between legitimacy illegitimate, illegitimacy legitimate, law and fate, good and bad, left lung and right lung. As I told you, I'm fed up with the truth and the truths. The bombs that fall or will fall on your head are the truth. Useless money that buys everything is the truth. Politicians' and notables' treason is the truth. Cancer, heart attacks, syphilis, abortion, are the truth. How can you possibly make the difference between decency and indecency? Men, women, comrades, friends, grandfathers, enemies, white, yellow, black, greyish, bitter, sweet, sad, deceived, proud... Truth is nothing but the lie of truth, life, the illusion of life, death, a simple inconsequence. However death is the only moral. You should occupy your leisure dying, dying properly, for somebody, something to love. To live. Because tomorrow, once you're dead, it's gonna be too late to really die. Only pornography... Only pornography is not humorous. What we used to say when we were kids: "What... the Brother... said." The other thing that's not humorous... The other thing that's not humorous is politics. Is... Is po... Is poli... Is politics. Where will stop the hypocrisy of those who think for others and the weakness of those who let it be? Where will stop the hypocrisy of those who despise man in allowing him to be only passive and where will stop the weakness of those who let it be... this simple, passive spectator before the world and before the screens that cheat the world, cheat love, life and death. Cinema must be vanquished. Screens must be burnt, and that fire must be of joy to break down the frigidity of mankind. Air must become music, and falling snow must be falling snow.
