If we go with you, then it wouldn't be the same. Right! Your mother wants to see your father! Go! Go! Stupid! Go! I am trapped on the thirteenth floor, come save me. Little Fa, can you give a little emotion? Darn, show some emotion. I am trapped on the thirteenth floor, come save me. We will be right there... Don't worry. Right! Mrs. Fa, I will push the thirteenth floor's button But we will end up on the fifteenth floor. I will push the button again and we will end up on the twelveth floor. I will then push the button and we will end up on the fourteenth floor. Mrs. Fa, this building doesn't have a 14th floor. Yes! He is right... Really? What? Nothing... Nothing? The steps are wrong! We should end up on fifteenth floor first. I will push the button again and we should end up on 15th floor. Thirdteenth... Fifteen?! What is going on? Wah! Nothing... Mrs. Fa, what is going on? This is not fifteenth floor! Sing, how can I get back to the old house? I want to see Ah Fa. Mrs. Fa, we will try again. Again?! - Little Fa... Come out. - Don't worry. What? We will try again. We will go into the elevator, push the button... And the old lady will appear. We will turn around and then we will leave the elevator. Shut up! Just start when the old lady diappears. This is what I mean. Go... go. Sing, we have to be fast. Put your hands on the wall and count to three and scream. Do I have to go higher? Yes! One, two, three! Mrs. Fa! Enough! The old lady has gone, let's go. Sing, what should we do now? Mrs. Fa, run that way. Wait. Why are you screaming? We were screaming like this yesterday. You are right! We can't see old lady anymore. Which way should we go? If we didn't see the old lady, we should go this way. But if the old lady is here we should go that way. But the old lady is not here... Which way should we go? This building is haunted! You don't have to be so scared?! Uncle Wah, you are more scary than a ghost! Forget it, we should continue with our steps. Mrs. Fa, the rest is going to be kind of tough. If we run you have to run. If we walk you have to walk. Sing, wait. Mrs. Fa... Sing... Mother? Did she run past us? Are you okay? Mother... Ah Fa, Little Fa said he saw our old house and it's truth. Honey. I am a ghost already. You must have suffered a lot this past couple of years. You have to raise the kid alone. But he is our son. Honey, do you still hate me? No. I hate myself for asking you to die on the phone. Why did you... You... You never listen to what I said... Why... For many years, I felt very guilty. It's like I murdered my own husband. I am a murderer! Do you know that? I am very hurt! Since that day I was never happy. Honey, my death is not your fault. I just want to take the ghost with me. So I can save both of you. You lied! Why didn't you come back to see me all these years? Not even in my dreams. I am sorry... I just don't have guts to face you. Why are you still here for all these years? Because I am waiting for you. Waiting for me?! There is one thing I haven't done. That is why I am still here! What is it? Tell me. I will finish it for you so you can rest in peace. Ah Fa, say it. Honey, sorry! Will you forgive me? Is that all you want to say? Ah Fa, I haven't changed a bit. If I have a chance to start over I wil still marry you. Thank you, honey. Little Fa. Sorry! I was never able to help you. Dad can't be with you So you have to take care of your mom. Honey. I... I... I love you. - Ah Fa... - Dad... Dad. Sing, wait for me! Mrs. Fa. Mrs. Fa, where did you go? We have been looking for you. I saw Ah Fa. Okay! We don't have to look for him again. I want to go worship him tomorrow. I will go buy the sacrificial articles. Okay, I want to go too. I am going too! But please do it a little late. I need some sleep. Mother, I will put the chicken and fruits in place. I brought the newspaper too. You can burn candles for dad. Let me do it... Let me do it. Mrs. Fa, look, since your son has worked in my security company he behaves well now. You are right! Thanks, Ah Kon, you are something. Little Fa, will you go work at 888 Yam Yen Road? Uncle Kon, will I get a raise? Yes, you should! Yes! We have been working for so long. Two uncle, don't get me wrong. You two are lazy and always pick on the rookies. I don't think you should get any raise. You little darn?! Right! But you can't talk to your Uncle like this. No raise for you. Ha! Serve you right. Forget about business for awhile, let's worship Ah Fa.
