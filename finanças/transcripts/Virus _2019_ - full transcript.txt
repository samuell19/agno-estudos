Eager to wear the suit for the wedding. [Mockingly] Oh, that’s why you chose to be the keeper right? Be fair, he’d played for the last three and a half minutes. Not an issue bro, you just hold in, your tummy, when photos are taken. Being slim is not a big deal. Look at you, your internal organs will all be crap. You will know it only at the autopsy. Alas! you won’t be seeing it. That’s true, we won’t be. How are you going home? Won’t you drop me? No, I'm not going home, I’m already sleepy, will put up in the hostel room. What the hell are they doing? Just to trouble us. Madam, Superintendent has come. -Oh. [MOBILE PHONE CHIMES] Sajith.. Hey, Sajith, get up. Hey... Look, I’m not gonna swap our duty today, you just leave. You need not swap the schedule, please cover for me for an hour from 8.45 AM. Will do. Now keep quiet and go, let me sleep for a while. Are you in your right mind? Yes bro.. [SLOGANEERING] //Workers unity – Long live// //Justice should be served// Superintendent is coming. //Salary is our right, not your benevolence// Babu, I understand your problems, and definitely we will find a solution. Now, think of the commoner’s plight, before you go on strike. What about our plight then? We have'nt been paid for the last 6 months. Babu, your contract starts next month, right? Does it make any difference? The situation will be the same. Isn’t it? We have done our part, rules and regulations are there, you know. Everything will be sorted out in a week. We don’t want to trouble the people, those who have duty will report in a while. Hope you hold your end of the deal. One week. Anyhow let the strike shed remain there. Bye sir. Good Morning -Hi. Where is Nirmala? She is in the Red Area. He came with chest pain, index pain was at 4 AM, had briefly gone to hypertension, in between, stabilized after that.

He has severe fever and headache for the last two days, started talking gibberish since yesterday, threw up a couple of times this morning. Does he have breathing difficulty? -Yes What about the vitals ? Saturation is low. Move him. Sajith, aren’t you coming? I am on the way. Please do rush. His condition seems to be serious, can you please attend? Yes.. Yes. Athira, Where is Abid? -There he is, intubating. Get me an Ambu bag (Manual Resuscitator). Aabi.. -Yes. I will manage it. Thank you. Are you leaving? Yep. It’s not time yet. It is. Let’s have the breakfast. Don’t you have duty? It’s OK, I can drop you. No need, I can catch a rickshaw from here. Is there any problem? Nothing. I saw your message. So, you read the message, that’s all I have to say. That you are going home? Yes, I am going, peace be upon you [Islamic greeting]. Do you remember the date of the accident? It’s been almost a year. Oh, we need the exact date, what I should do if you don’t remember? Let me check. Alright, next. Rs.35… give this at the OP office. Do you know where it is? -No. Honey, please show him the OP building I am in a hurry, Chechi -Please do… As if she goes straight for some Emergency. Are you Doctor? Yes. What kind of? -Community Medicine. You mean, a bone specialist? Look bro, the OP is in the 1st floor of that building. Are you insulting me? Why should you be insulted? [MOBILE PHONE RINGS] Yes, Sajith. How would you go? -Abid will drop me. Look, that patient with ARDS… Don’t say he is dead. Not like that, but it’s getting worse. I am on my way. Come soon. What’s at home? Is it a proposal or something? I don’t know. Are you OK with it? Why should I tell you? Can’t you just behave properly! -I am. Ok, you are frustrated, but won’t tell me why. Alright, you may go, I have patients to attend. Ok. Good luck, take care, my friend. [SLAPS] [SOMBRE MUSIC] Are you looking for Suhana? -Yes. She left the class, was quite unwell. I had taken some medical records from her home. Wanted to return those. I shall hand it out, I am her neighbor. Do you know Razak? (Suhana's Father) -Yes. Alright then. [MOBILE PHONE RINGING] [SUHANA PANTING] [TENSE MUSIC] His name was Roshan. Fever with ARDS (Acute respiratory distress syndrome) But his condition worsened quickly. Didn’t survive for long. He had vomiting, ain’t he? , aspiration might have caused respiratory failure But he was very young Are you having the night shift tonight in causality? Yes Ma’m Geetha, the attender in radiology is admitted with viral fever. She should get special care, the Superintendent had called me. Who is on duty now? Abid and Afna OK, inform them too Sure, Ma’m. -Ok..? Ok Papa, would you give me your phone Sure, in a while, now you go and study. Don’t touch me… Anu.. Dear, Keep your books in the room. And come, lets have dinner. I have washed my clothes, you keep off from it Why, what’s the issue? A patient came today, 21 year old Pradeep. Presented with high fever, temperature was above 103 F Was it dengue? No, He was tested negative for Dengue. His report from the Medical College read 'fever for 5 days and altered sensorium’, came here because it was crowded there. It may be of high fever At this young age!? He showed no altered sensorium after coming here, Initially blood pressure was normal; 120 over 80. Paracetamol had been infused to control the fever, and BP was being checked in regular intervals. In a couple of hours he started showing distress BP was 230 over 120 Don’t exaggerate, don’t you know how to check the BP? I did check properly Abid told it was normal, let’s have a look. Geetha.? Geetha.. Let’s check the other hand Geetha After a while he started throwing up, had severe head ache too. After some time his behavior changed drastically as in rabies. I probed the bystanders whether he had animal bite or something, they said no. No, doctor, he had fever only. He too nodded in negative. Have you been bitten by some dog or? -No In a while he started throwing up incessantly, body was not responding to the medicines. Then I thought of sending him for an MRI. By then he was unstable because of seizures. MRI was not possible. Rajetta, she is showing segmental seizure, we can’t take MRI... let’s go back, let’s go. Why do you think it is contagious? When I was about to leave, I got a call. Another patient Akhila, from Perambra has turned up with similar symptoms. Headache, vomiting and ARDS. She also has tested negative for Dengue. I am having sort of intuition. Is that Pradeep also from Perambra? No. [MOURNFUL MUSIC] [LABORED BREATHING] Clear off, clear off. Name and age please. Akhila, 34. I am a nurse at Perambra hospital. I have severe head ache and fever. Vomiting also, now only it subsided. Dengue is negative. Take an OP ticket, -Let me check the saturation. This is something else, not dengue. Please intubate me. Please call someone senior Doctor Abid.. Doctor Abid.... Yes..?? It’s a referral from the Central Hospital. She’s a nurse. Saturation seems low. [BREATHING HEAVILY] Doctor, I can’t breathe, please intubate me. Let me examine. Please intubate me. Do we have her previous reports? Ok, Dengue is negative, Will do one more. It’s not dengue. Not vomiting also Oh.. you have taken its medicines as well. Don’t worry, don’t worry, we will take care of you, sister, you are one of us This’s not dengue. We will repeat the tests; move her to the red area, initiate oxygen and go for the routine check-up once more. Don’t worry, we will take care of you [AKHILA PANTING] Sister, please increase the oxygen flow. [LABORED BREATHING] Bilateral infiltrates are there in the X-ray. We can repeat an ABG and go for ventilator if needed Doctor Abid, she is not maintaining saturation. Doctor, would my daughter be contracted with this? -No. No. I had breastfed her. Hey, no nothing will happen, Don’t worry. You do not talk, intubate her Sister get the intubate set. It is contagious, Doctor. A patient I tended had the same symptoms. He died. Same symptoms? His relatives are admitted in Baby memorial hospital with similar symptoms. Ok, ok, you calm down, do not talk. [BREATHING RAPIDLY] Two have already died from Razak’s family, for me they are not mere voters. It was from their home, I started my life's first door-to-door election campaign. All of them has respiratory distress. In Suhana’s case brain has been infected. Will get a clearer picture after the autopsy. Their condition worsened very quickly. Routine test results were all negative. The advanced tests have been fast tracked. Razak’s brother and son are on the way to Manipal with the samples. OK, Thanks When is the result expected? Result? I will send it. We shall wait. Why should you wait? Weren’t you supposed only to carry it here? This is my Father’s samples, he is my uncle. Oh, I’m sorry Ok. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] Peace be upon you [Islamic Greeting] May the peace, mercy, and blessings of Allah be with you too. Quite a greeting it was, brother Razak. What if it was my last? Let it be a proper one Have you started playing the Doctor too? I had a look at Suhana’s CT scan. It was same as Zakariya’s. My daughter’d been telling me, that it was all over. Isn’t it enough (to understand), Doctor? Doctor, my son had some debts, which I am obliged to repay, now what happens to it? I am not taking your time, you may do your duty. I have already done that. You take rest. His eyelids are heavy of drowsiness. Stiff neck and tremors are symptoms of brain infection. It could be poison, but not a snake bite, because four members of this family fell sick at different times. Because of this fever and systemic autonomic symptoms, I don’t see the chances of poison in this. As all of them are from the same family, this is clustering of cases, this should be considered as viral encephalitis. Doctor, Herpes simplex and Japanese encephalitis are tested negative, as per Dr.Suresh Rajan’s update. Other possibilities are.. West Nile encephalitis and Equine encephalitis, but they have not been reported in India. If it makes such a rapid progression in a healthy body, it should be Nipah virus Ask Dr.Suresh to run a test for that too. Name Suhana. Moderately built and nourished adult female. 24 years 43 kilograms, 157 centimeters. This is the brain, this is edematous. As she was a fever patient with altered sensorium, we should take a bit of it and send to the pathology lab. Lakshmi.. Sir, Health minister on line. Hello, teacher [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC CONTINUES] [HIZZING OF THE FUMIGATOR] We won’t go unless we get to meet the Superintendent. He is not here at the moment Hey, what’s the problem here? We need to know why this place has been fumigated. I am the one who performed the autopsy. You need not be agitated. There was a situation, and we took care of it. Sir, don’t try to sugarcoat, we need a proper explanation Our primary duty is to safe guard people’s health, isn’t it? That is why we did fumigate the place. Do you think we will do something that could jeopardize your safety? Would we, Midhun? Abid..?? So stop creating a scene here. Disperse, please. We have identified the virus. The samples we tested were of Dr. Sudevan’s patients. Ma’am.. It’s Nipah A zoonotic disease, which is one among the ten WHO priority diseases. This could be transmitted from animal to man or directly between humans Nipah has been reported in Singapore, Malaysia, Bangladesh and India till date. In 1998, 102 of 265 people infected were died in Malaysia. Since 2001, 75% of the 263 patients lost their lives in India and Bangladesh. The scariest fact is that, neither vaccination nor treatment protocol are in place. Technically, as per the samples we got, this is the third day. But If we consider Zakariya as the index patient this is the fifteenth day of the outbreak. The number of patients may substantially increase in the next 24 hours. Can we have a number? Apart from Dr. Sudevan’s three patients, there are another two in the MCH. No Madam, two more patients have been admitted with similar symptoms Then it’s been 7 We will have to wait to get the exact number of infected patients. Those who have contracted the virus from the index patient may come in the next six days. It could be four per day or even more which means there would be 25 patients In the next incubation period, which is, at least 21 days from the beginning of this wave there could be 25 new patients from each of the existing 25. We are talking about 625 patients in a month. And we can’t be definite that the death toll won't touch the same number. [TENSED MUSIC] Luck is the only hope for the infected, talking of the others, maybe we have hope. As the patients are coming from different localities, we have to stand clear about the number of sources. We are yet to define the transmission dynamics of the outbreak. Anyone who had contact with the patients should be quarantined and observed Those who participated in the funeral, bystanders, those who have the possibility of socializing with the patients. all of them should come under this list, may be some of us too. This is not an easy task for sure, this is not meant for scientists or surgeons In short, if at all we have to hope something, it should come from your side only. Yes sir, hm. Health services and the District- administration should operate from here. For the time being this would be our control room. Ok teacher. We can do it with minimal make-shift. Smrithi, identify the members for the core committee and coordinate with them. Sure Teacher, Maya come with me. Maya, you should fetch me some contacts, I will give you the names. Not only their office numbers, but personal contact info also. Don't we need some volunteers? We can start with my interns, and then form a team through them. The period in which the disease could be transmitted from each patient, the incubation period, is 21 days. Which means, from the first reported patient Zakariya, 21 days. that is, 5 May to 26 May. After that, If new cases are reported, this cycle may repeat. It should be stopped, if we are to succeed completely. This is a list prepared by the health inspectors, of suspected people, who may get infected. What you need to do is, identify people who might have been in contact with them, and add each of them to the list. Okey. The important thing, there should be four categories– First category, Those who had direct contact with the patient; Second, those who have used the belongings of the patients; Third category, those who have travelled along with the patient; like, same van, train or whatever. And finally; those who have shared the room space with them. I repeat, the categorisation is important. [SARA CHOKES & COLLAPSES] The latest patient is a student of the MCH, so the caregivers including the Doctors are panic-struck. Not only we should ensure their attendance but have to address their concerns as well. You do the briefing. I will say it before you first, you might have something to add. This is not an announcement about some accident or tragedy, but an advisory. The presence of Nipah virus has been confirmed, in the district, after we examined the samples from patients admitted to- the Medical college hospital and the Baby memorial hospital. Even though Nipah is contagious, it can be controlled- with the help of the media and the public. All should cooperate with the health department in its initiatives to curb this outbreak. The city and its outskirts are soaked in fear as the information about the Nipah outbreak is coming out. Close physical contact with the patients could cause the spread of the virus. In order to prevent this, experts advice to keep away from public gatherings like marriage, funeral and religious meetings. Health department advice the public to be careful while consuming fruits which might have been partially eaten by animals or birds. The small scale shops and establishments are the worst affected with the fruit merchants taking a real beating. Even vehicular traffic is very minimal. The pay-ward block of the MCH has been converted into the Isolation center. As decided by the high level meeting the patients who were admitted in the pay-ward have been shifted- -to the multi-specialty wing and the Palliative care institute. The process of moving patients and the setting up of isolation ward- ..'ve been carried out as per the WHO protocol. We have a list of 2853 people who had been in proximity with the patients. 291 of this have had direct contact with the patient. This list includes relatives, by- standers, and care givers including doctors and nurses. This is the list. Son, Nabeesa is with me here. Why don’t you go to the hospital? No, I should be here, Mom. Then, you may go to the Mosque, the least. Don’t sit idly here. I wonder why you are not getting the gravity of the situation. Son, come on in, I won't let you leave without a proper good bye. You please keep the bag there and go. Then, I am also coming with you to the flat. All you need to do is pray for me, Peace be upon you. And unto you peace. [Islamic Greeting] Yes sure. Both of them would come? -Yes, both Doctors are instructed not to go on leave, right? That’s meant for clinical practitioners, they are the ones who are needed here. Please don't take this the wrong way. You pack your things, I will help. [PHONE RINGS] Hello. Annu, we need two additional hands at the Nipah cell, to work on an FAQ. Can you get there soon? Ok Ma’am, I will be right there. It’s a herculean task to monitor almost 3000 peoples. It’s precisely 2853 people, we should constantly check on them to ascertain their health condition. The social life of these many people will be messed up. That’s inevitable. The contact list has been updated for the patient Pradeep who tested positive yesterday. He had participated in his uncle’s funeral, but we don’t know how many people attended the function. We will have to find that. [BROADCAST AUDIO] The admission of Akhila, a nurse from- the Govt hospital- Perambra, with Nipah has triggered panic among the health workers. Akhila’d been the one who tended the index patient Zakariya. The health minister said that the Government would take every step possible to take the health officials in to confidence. So many people are infected, aren’t they? Hey, no it’s not like that. No it’s not like that. What about my daughter? She is good. Don't be tensed. Mother? She’s there, I just met her. She is Ok. You will be shifted to the ward soon, then you can meet all of them. Can you give me a pen and paper? [MOBILE PHONE RINGS] Nirmala. Abid.. Sister Akhila is dead. [MOURNFUL MUSIC] [BROADCAST AUDIO] There are confusions over the cremation of Sister Akhila. According to the sources, her body might not be handed over to the relatives. There is no further official information available on this matter. Sir, we cannot keep the body for long. Ten hours, the maximum, trust me on this. OK. Let’s call Dr. Baburaj. Him..?! He will make it happen some how. Hm.. How are things unfolding, Ma’am? Body is still there in the isolation ward. We should take a decision in 12 hours. We should train the workers to use PPE kit and body wrapping. Do we have them? We can’t be sure about the daily wagers. She is a nurse, Everybody is scared. We don’t have enough PPE kits either. You don’t worry about it, Ma’am. Collector will arrange the kits and the drivers for the Ambulances. I need three more men, I can join them as the fourth. We are ready to give Ambulances attached to our NGO, but no driver is willing. The vehicles have insurance and other papers. If something bad happens during the trip, who will look for us? Just saying as we would be painted as villains. Not at all, You are all heroes. You guys showed the heart to come over. Normally nobody does, I know. For the last few hours, this place has been surprising me like anything. We did not have enough ventilators, it was provided by the private hospitals. We need at least 800 PPE kits, a day. Agreed, it is very difficult to arrange. But by early morning, PPE kits worth around 80 lakh rupees arrived at our airport. An industrialist friend from here made it possible, in his own aircraft from abroad. This morning, Dr Sridevi, was picking up the newspaper at her gate, an unidentified man turned up with a bundle of N95 mask. He just handed over it and left. He did not even bother to introduce himself. For me, these are all miracles, you might not be feeling so, coz you are the natives of this city. Sir, I need two things to be assured. I should be paid on-the-spot. If something happens to me, the Government should take care of my family including my children’s studies. What’s your name? Sadasivan. Brother Sadasivan, Firstly, you will be paid, doubt not. On the second matter, I can assure that nothing will happen to you. You give that assurance in writing, I am ready to come. Those who are ready to cooperate, write YES on this paper with your name and phone numbers. Those who are not, simply write NO, nothing else. [RUSTLING OF NOTE PAD] Everybody is scared, no one is coming. The workers are not available. Government is considering to regularize those who cooperates with this mission. [EXHALES] So, no interview, this time !? My contract starts only from next month. You do everything by the books, don't you, Sir? We do this work not only for the wages. This is an institution where common people like us get treated. I am ready for anything, you tell me what. Nobody will compel you, Babu. There is nothing wrong in being scared. I am not scared, Madam. But, I can’t stand if anything happens to my family. Why do you want this many clothes? -Will have to stay for some days. In the hospital? Yes.. You need not do something stupid. Not like that, what if they regularize me after this? Its a Government Job after all. Where are you going, Dad? To the hospital. You might be happy that you don’t have classes, right? Hang the bag on one shoulder. -Is that the fashion? No, the left strap is about to rip-off. Off I go, there is some work. Are you about to cremate her? Sandeep, I don’t have any pleasantries for to offer. No matter what I say, none of us will be kin for her. No one else should have her fate, that’s why we are not handing over the body. Why did I come all the way? There was no need to... [VOICE BREAKS] There is no use of me. Where is your daughter? Hello. -Where are you? On duty, in the male ward. So, aren’t you studying for the test? It’s become a joke. Got posted here on request, only to get busier than ever. Causality duty was better than this. What’s up in there for you to be this much involved? A young patient with fever. He is too unwell. Throwing up constantly. You should clear the test this year. I am really fed up with this lonesome life here. Shouldn’t we attend when the patients get sick? He is as young as our Nikhil. I am also not well here, [FAKE COUGH] Why don’t you come and attend me? Here, there are so many patients who need care for real. Fake patients can wait. Sister, please attend him. Leave that phone behind. I will call later. Ok. Put the glasses on. Left and Right... this is Right.. Body should be wrapped first. Who’s coming with me? Come. Sandeepetta.. I am almost on the way. We won’t be meeting again, Sorry. Take good care of our daughter. She is too young. Please take her to Dubai with you. Don’t be lonesome like our Dad, Please. With lots of love, Kisses.. Sara got it from me only. How come it be possible? Stop your nonsense. We did intubate Roshan, right? Wasn't he having the symptoms as Sister Akhila? I went to meet Sara straight from there. So what? I kissed her, man. [RUSTLING OF PLASTIC] Haven’t I told you not to enter here? Get out Don’t act dumb, get out. Hey, brother, don’t be mad at him. He might have lost his way. It’s not safe here, you should not have come here, please stay away. These three cases from the Baby memorial hospital have been tested positive. There are 5 more positive cases in the MCH. Besides, we are expecting the lab results for another seven. Case number 1, Anjali Vasudevan, 26, from Makkaraparambu, Malappuram. No no no.. -Anjali She was admitted with Encephalitis with altered sensorium. Relax. How far is this Makkaraparambu from Perambra? Around 90-95 kilometers. With this distance, for me, this spread does'nt look like from natural sources. Next case: Krishnankutty Thachaparambil. Aged 40, admitted with fever and ARDS. and he is from Mukkom, Kozhikode. Sara Yakub, 24, is a house surgeon in the Medical college Hospital (MCH). She showed the symptoms at the college. [TENSE MUSIC] What about the others? They did not come. Local people are wary about them as they carried the body. They will come once the issue is sorted out. Is it possible? I don’t know, some sort of talks are under way. Sister, It’s me, Vishnu. Please ask Majeed to pick up my call. So, you need Majeed now, when your wife got admitted in the hospital, right? It should have been you, instead of that poor girl. You will have to answer to the God for sure. The body of a Nipah patient is expected anytime now. I’m instructed to block the door. What should I do? Whose body? Krishnankutty’s? Is it not been over yet? No. The workers have not turned up. Let me see. Where are you going? You can’t enter. Sir, do you need help? Let him in. Oh, Doctors?! That’s interesting, come. My wife is admitted here. What’s her name? -Anjali. Have you seen her? Yes. How is she? She will survive, won’t she? It was all because of me, I had been stupid. If we go there with that protection gear we used just now, there is no difference between you and me. [WEEPING} I am all disturbed dear. Are we becoming a burden for others? I get scared when somebody tries to help us. Have you noticed the photo of our marriage? Weren't we wearing an artificial happiness? Original happiness will come with our baby. [CHUCKELS] Then it will be full of real happiness. -Are you crazy? I am thinking of the house rent for the month. The air blower is not working. Without it, the smoke won’t go out. Sir, we can’t run the cremation furnace. You try some other public crematorium, may be East hill. Another death has been reported from the Baby hospital, the toll could rise further. We will have to find a solution. I'm trusting you on this. I will do my level best. [PHONE RINGING] Tell me sir. Any updates? On my way, will call once I finish this off Two more patients have been died in the MCH; Anjali and Pradeep. Sir.. I will call you back. You guys need not assemble here, only those who work here should stay. Spell it out. If they do it here, we are done. So, all of you work here? Who is Rajan? Are you ready? Sir, we are scared. Why? Sir, I need an enforcement team here. No need of Police. We can't afford to succumb to the pressure from these people. We are not doing it forcefully. We already have a body in the vehicle and two more are in the hospitals. Should I roam around with corpses like this? Why are you talking like this? Sir you know, I am already at cross with the Corporation. What I need is your support to finish this job at hand. We will need Police force. Using force is an easy option for me. I entrusted you with this task to avoid it. I need you to do it without spooking the people there. [BROADCAST AUDIO] The fatality rate of the Nipah virus here has touched 90 percent creating panic among the officials. Where as it is 60% to 70% in other countries. Do you have a cigarette? Can’t even have a smoke with this crap put on. Sir, can you find a place for cremation? If so? I know people who do it. This zipper should be tight, press here after wearing the mask. Is it tight? Do you want cigarette? No. Do you have a family? Not anymore. She has sent me (divorce) notice. I am yet to sign it. Why did you stop there? Ran out of questions? What about you? I have wife and two daughters. I too wanted to have kids, but it won’t suit my character. I should have signed that notice, didn’t do it yet, for some reason. Sir? Sir? [GROANS] [RAIN CHATTERS] Didn’t you buy the groceries? What happened? Dad has Nipah, hasn’t he? Who says so? Sivan, the shop keeper. He told us not to come to the shop anymore, He won’t give us anything. Dad is alright, he has gone for duty. No, he has Nipah, else why don’t he come home? Mom, you just ring him. [MOBILE PHONE RINGS , SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] [MOBILE PHONE RINGS] They were about to shift to this new place. All of them were there to clean the well. Nobody has come here after Zakariya's death. [CLANGING SOUND OF THE BUCKET & WING FLAPPING OF FRUIT BATS] [RICKSHAW MOVING] Sister, this is tenth block, where to go from here? Do you know the late Pradeep’s house? You may please ask around, Pay me Rs 70. You’d agreed to wait, hadn’t you? Sorry, I can’t. Please give me the fare. Have this. I thought, you won’t have tea from here. What do you want to know? Would you answer some questions? [1. Is your ration distribution prompt?] Are you getting the ration without fail ? They drop it on the road and honk. [2. Have you shown any symptoms of disease?] Mother, do you have any physical discomforts? Yet again the same question. Glad that you asked in person. Jameela lost two of her kids in two weeks. Didn’t even get to see Razak for one last time. We won’t stand if the body is burnt. You are the only one we got to request. This is matter of public health. I can’t agree with risking it, for religious sentiments. I prefer to stand with the family. It’s not a negligible issue. Moreover, personally I can’t watch them suffer again. That should not be our priority now. Is cremation the only way out? We are following Ebola protocol. Cremation is recommended in it, as Ebola spreads through body fluids. In Africa deep burial also had been done, considering the cultural sentiments. No evidence suggests Nipah could spread through body fluids. Its a droplet spread disease. Do you think deep burial is safe? In Malaysia, it was burial in 1999. No outbreak has been reported there after. In 2010, W.H.O had issued guidelines for deep burial after the outbreak in Bangladesh. If we have a scientific base for the burial, why is this confusion, again? Our concern should be about the place of burial and the people around. We would also require a deep burial expert. If the facilitation is ready, I can send experts from the NCDC (National Center for Disease Control). What did the doctor say? Doctor told Yahya that all is fine in the X-ray. Then why don’t you remove the steel rod? Let the rod stay there rather, than a week long hospitalization for the surgery. It’s your leg, and your choice. This is for the one (Rabbit) stays inside. You could have brought some Indian Borage leaves for Zakariya. How is his fever? He has gone to the Doctor’s with Yahya on his motorbike. Mr. Santhan Vaidyar, you spread false information while the entire state is fighting the virus. Can you substantiate your point that Nipah is not spread by the bats? Abhilash, can you scientifically prove that it is spread by bats? These guys tested the bat poop first; then closed all the wells in the locality. Now they say it is fruit bats. Eating fruits is forbidden! Don't eat this.! Don't eat that.! What a farce! Its 100% unscientific. You have no moral right to talk about science. Why.?! Is science your own crap? -It’s neither your crap Then you tell us by your crap, where did it come from? SWAGs aren't enough. Alright, It is a not a matter to be argued between you. A scientific explanation is needed. Doctor Smrithi, What scientific version can you give, officially? It’s not wise to jump into conclusions, especially at this point in time. Inquiries are underway on Zakariya, the index patient. Evidence are being collected about how the others contracted the virus. Controversies won’t do any good at this time. [QUACKING OF DUCKS] My kids and husband didn’t deserve to suffer. They might have reached the heaven. Yahya, Where were you on 4 th May? I went back to college in Mananthawady. Ok. What is it? Do you want these pigeons? I am coming. Zakariya was admitted in the Taluk hospital around 11 AM on 4 May. There were 12 patients in the male ward then. He was on bed number 8. Eight patients who were there, tested positive for Nipah and died later. [COUGHS] Sister Akhila was on duty on that day. Sister, please come, brother is not well. -Hold it tight What happened? [COUGHS] We all know she contracted the virus on that day. Zakariya’s father Razak and sister Suhana were also there as bystanders. Patient Lohitakshan and his bystander Rajesh. Lohitakshan was on bed no: 7, Next to Zakariya's bed. They might have helped each other. The toilet is on the far end of the ward. Zakariya might have thrown up on his way to the toilet, causing infection to Rajan of bed number 3. Prabeesh and Sunil who were the bystanders of two other patients also got infected. Zakariya’s mother did not contract the disease despite being there. Due to the hate for hospital smell, she used to cover her nose with the sari. That might have saved her. So, what about (Zakariya's aunt) Khadeeja? Zakariya was discharged early on 5 May, as he’d been referred to the MCH. Please wait till I reach brother, I am almost there. I want to see him. Come. Son, what happened to you? [Cultural practice: Blowing on face after reciting religious verses for protection] Okay, let’s go. We should consider six patients including Khadeeja as hospital spread. Suhana and Razak are community spread. We need to find out the epidemiological link of the remaining eight people. [MOTOR BIKE REVS] Could you drop me by that driving school? What’s your name? -Pradeep. I am Kunju. Which gear is better when we go at a speed of 20 KpH? It’s not like that. What if we go at 60-70 KpH? Pradeep’s mother told me about the accident, that’s why I probed further. I have Kunju’s OP ticket with me, it’s on 5 May, the same day Zakariya was admitted. Couldn’t there be a possible contact between Pradeep and Zakariya? Yes, it’s possible, but we can’t prove anything with two OP tickets. How did they get exposed to each other? Can we say everybody had contact with Zakariya on 5 May? Why not? All of them are quarantined because of that possibility. The sequence of events at the MCH after Zakariya’s arrival should be traced. We will get a clearer picture then. Yes. After Anjali and her husband Vishnu from Makkaraparambu, another patient Sneha from Chemmadu got infected. To clear some possible doubts, we probed in detail. She had been in the MCH on 2nd May with her mother, said a relative. From the CCTV visuals we have checked, it was found that Zakariya also was there then (May 2nd). Sneha and her mother was there at the same time. And why was Zakariya there, on that day. He came with his uncle for a scan. He had a surgery scheduled to remove of a rod from his leg. Sneha and her mother came for a US Scan for appendicitis. You are trying to say that Sneha is linked to that index patient, Zakariya? Which is now obvious. Zakariya, whom you try to place at the MCH, was actually down with a burn on his leg. It was his brother Yahya who’d come to the hospital with his uncle. What are you guys trying to cover up? There is nothing to cover up. We are trying to dig out all the information we could. Then why can’t you consider the possibility of a weaponised Nipah attack? The natural reservoirs of Nipah are in plenty here, then what is the relevance of such a conspiracy theory? There is nothing to be surprised of. Even the WHO has endorsed that Nipah could potentially be a bio weapon. Can you say how could it be weaponised? Ma’am there are many methods, Anthrax was transmitted by a letter. It’s politically irresponsible to move ahead without considering this aspect. Where did you get these information about Zakariya? You should be worried not because we got it, but you didn’t. I have asked a junior resident to come, he will be there in no time. Annu? Which patient do you want to see? Vishnu, what is his condition? His throat swab only was tested positive. Blood and Urine were negative. He has got some fever, but he is clinically stable with no ARDS or Encephalitis features. It’s very confusing. Are you sleeping? Take out that money, we have to give it back to Majeed. We should keep our ‘happiness’? But.. Anjali, why didn’t you wait for me? Hadn’t the doctor said so? You didn’t even feel like waiting for me. Brother Majeed also told its only possible today. You two did kill my baby..! [SLAPS & SOBS] We could not trace the contact of your relatives. Even if you did, they would not acknowledge us. Vishnu was admitted here on 5th May after poison intake, was Anjali with you? Yes, she only was there. [SOBS] Vishnu.. Vishnu.. Abid.. Abid..! Good evening Annu. -Good evening Ma’am. As you asked, I looked in to that Sneha’s case. She’d been here on 5th May also, almost the same time as Zakariya. Do you have any details proving they were there on 5th may? No, Ma’am. I’d called her mother yesterday, you’ll get it from the CCTV footages. Ok. -Ok Annu, we’ll see. Annu, aren’t you leaving? Annu? Who is it? She is an SPM student, (Social and- Preventative Medicine) in the FAQ team. [SNIFFLING] She has done some research work on her own. It’s from her, Preethi and team are getting the data. [SNIFFLING] Then, ask her to present in our review meeting. Ok. I prepared this after, talking to some of the people concerned. I think, the CCTV footages from that day could prove more effective. That we can arrange. Tell us about your findings Zakariya was in the MCH from 10 AM to 4.30 PM on May 5th. What I probed was, the presence of other Nipah positive patients in the MCH, on that day. He was in the yellow area, which means here. Shameer, who’d been treated for a fall injury, was also there. Around 11.15 AM, Zakariya was taken to the radiology department. [COUGHING] He was moved back to the casualty as he started coughing and vomiting. Praveen, Krishnankutty, and Sneha were there at this time. They might have got infected from there. None of them are in the patient list on that day. All of them were bystanders, I’d collected the details of bystanders too. Praveen came there for the X-ray of his uncle who’d been treated after an accident. Krishnankutty had to get the scan result of his wife, who was undergoing a surgery for uterus removal. How did you know about the time? I’d collected the OP tickets on which time also is written. By 12 noon, Zakariya was brought back to the casualty, where he threw up again. Pradeep was there at that time He came with a patient named Kunju. By 1.30 PM Zakariya was taken again for the CTscan. where he had seizures and vomited again on the corridor. Anjali and Vishnu were there, then. Finally, the CT scan was taken by 3 PM, but he died soon after. So, the spread is from the index patient himself with the only exception of Sara Yakub. There is a rumour in the MCH… Abid Rahman, a PG student, had been in contact with Sara. He intubated the patient, Roshan just before meeting her. Even Abid belives so. But I am not sure about such a transmission dynamics. More over Roshan doesn’t fit the bill as a Nipah patient. [COUGHS] [COUGHS] Let me push off. Have to make a video call to my kids before they sleep. Annu, your findings were very crucial. It doused the controversy over the patients from Malappuram. You’ve done a good job. Thank you ma'am. Thank you. Good night. What if that Roshan was Nipah positive? Then matters will be more complicated. Sir, Ma’am is quite unwell. Come on in. What do we do from here on? [MOBILE RINGING] Hello. Have you slept? No, I was putting the kids to sleep. When are you coming? Shall we come over there? Just to see you. That’s not a good idea. This too should pass. 50 dose of a medicine, containing Human monoclonal antibody is expected to arrive from Australia in a week Even though, unapproved, it can be used in human body on compassionate grounds, which means, as a last attempt to save the life. In Australia, this medicine had been very effective against some other viruses. But against Nipah it is experimental. Dr. Smrithi says she is willing for the trial. I have mapped 8 suspicious deaths in the corporation limit, between 5th and 17th of May. Roshan also is in this list. Thank Goodness, It’s only eight. Shall I keep it here, or? No, you hand it over to Annu. Who is that? Who is Annu? Sir. I am asked to give it to you. So, you are that ‘detective’? I have checked only four patients from the list. That’s enough. They are the ones who showed Nipah-like symptoms. Sudheesh and Charles can be seen in the footage. Geetha might have got infected from the radiology room. Roshan is the only one who sticks out. We have to ascertain his presence near the MCH. You may seek the help of the cyber cell. On 5 May, this Roshan had called one Nabeel and Vipin several times. The name Nabeel appears in the list, but not from Koduvalli. There are 8 people named Vipin in the direct contact list. Let me see. Can you call, Vipin, the Ambulance driver? Are you Vipin? Are you from the cyber cell or the health department? How do you know Roshan? He was my friend. On 5 May, he had called you several times, right? Yeah, he needed my vehicle. Had he come to the Perambra Hospital? No, when returning after a trip, I picked him up and together we went to Kakkayam. He had somebody to meet there. -Did he have Nipah? Was he your friend too? No, not mine. Are you too an ambulance driver? -Hey, no, I do no work. [MOBILE PHONE RINGS] Sajith.. Sara is conscious now. Have you seen her? -No, Harris told me, it was his shift. Now it’s mine, you want to swap? Yes, I am on my way, I want to see her. I thought so. [EXHALES] [HINDI VERSION OF THE SONG FROM KATHALAN] What the… Why did you stop? This Hindi version sounds awful, This is the better version. Really! Tamil is simply brilliant. What’s wrong with this one? [MOCKING] What is not wrong with this one? Hindi too is good, no? Both the Hindi lovers should get down after this bridge. Play it. [MUSIC RESTARTS] [Islamic Greeting] Peace be upon you.. You will survive for sure. Survival rate is 20-30 %, you definitely would get over. You are doing really better. I love you Sara. This Abid is an impossible character. If I express my love, he might taunt me. Annu says that Sara’s infection has nothing to do with Abid. If so, we need to know whether she had gone to radiology or casualty on 5 May. I don’t think she had gone. We were in Pediatrics during that period. Where is her phone? I had taken it to the room from the library. But now room is sealed. What to do? This is a CT scan report sent by Sara to a relative. The time stamp suggest that Sara might have gone to the radiology room, when Zakariya was there. Doesn’t it make a transmission possibility? Can you send it to me? Ok, Done. [PHONE RINGING] Hello. Doctor, there is a good news. The test results of Dr.Smrithi is negative. Oh.! Thats great. Sara is our best survivor yet. She shows improvement too. Vishnu also seems stable and there are no reported cases for the last six days. What does it say? It says nothing until this day passes. [COUGHS] Take me to the Medical College. -I am not going. Then, why are you wearing this uniform? -Didn’t I tell you?I am not going. [COUGHS] Don’t stop, he has Nipah. Go away. [COUGHS] [COUGHS] Who has Nipah? -Somebody stop him. Go away. Who has Nipah? Go away. -Must be you. Somebody stop him. Must be you. Strike him, Somebody stop him. We will share the location on WhatsApp, you send the ambulance ASAP. [TENSE MUSIC] Headache. [UNNIKRISHNAN SHIVERING & COUGHING] When did it start? Start, it started... it started... Sister, it’s not safe to take throat swab now. take the blood sample only. Let's take the blood. Hold the hands. [INAUDIBLE MUTTRING] Collect urine sample too. [COUGHING CONTINUES] [INAUDIBLE MUTTRING] Move him to the isolation. - OK Sir. [TENSE MUSIC CONTINUES] [MUTTRING] To where? please go slow. Initially we couldn’t take throat swabs as Unnikrishnan was agitated, We had done it after stabilizing him, sample’s been sent to the lab. If Unnikrishnan is positive, and we could find no link to the index patient Zakariya, Then we will have to worry.. Can you elaborate? It could either be a new cluster, or it could be the next attack from the terrorists. Hey, please don’t try to politicize the situation. We shouldn’t be risking national security for your political scheming. How can we be sure that terrorists are behind it? It could also be the drug mafia, right? I mean, there are many theories. We have to test the genetic similarity of virus to that of Zakariya. If they have the same genome, we have to prove the epidemiological link between both of them. If they are not the same, possibility of a weaponized attack can't be ruled out. If Unnikrishnan is the index patient of another cluster, similar number of patients and even deaths could be repeated. In that case we need to reinforce quarantine measures. We haven't even identified the source of the virus, in Zakariya’s case. After his dubious foreign stint, Zakariya became a Zoophile. He used to frequent nearby forest areas like Janakikkadu. He had more than six SIM cards, and four mobile phones. According to another report, he is a highly religious person. Listen, I have pressure from the defense ministry. If you cannot prove otherwise, in a week, The office of the Defense Ministry will take over this whole mission. If something is there to be found out, the Government will do it for sure. But now, we are not giving in to any political threats. The incubation period from Zakariya is ending today. Yet the possibility of Unnikrishnan being a secondary case from Zakariya, still exist. Aren’t you done? I need to go. -In a minute. Son, some one of the name H-I-5 is calling you for sometime. Mom, it’s not H-I-5, it's High-Five ! What’s your problem? Who is this High Five, brother? Tell me. It’s my friend, Mom. Have you pressed my red T-shirt? I have to leave, is breakfast ready? -Yes... Who is that? -Haifa! Who? -Haifa! Who? When did you meet last? Do you remember? We did not know anything until she said. We will go inside, let her talk freely. I don’t have such issues, Dad. We’d gone to Vayalada. Do you remember the date? Last week of April. Is this Zakariya's number? Yes, he used to call me from this one. Did you know of the many numbers he had? Was there any problems? What’s wrong in having more than one number? He had some debts, once he called me from another number, but asked not to save it. Why didn’t you tell your parents? Had Zakariya asked not to? No, Zakariya had already told his family about us, it was me who delayed it. If any acquaintances see us here, you say.... Hey… bike... Please don't laugh, please.. Hold this glass.. Burnt? Burnt!? -Ah, slightly. Tried calling you. Couldn’t get through. I don’t use phone anymore. It was my boy who spread it to all? wasn’t it? Can you please put Yahya in touch with nurse Akhila’s family? Sure. I need to know something else. That's why I came. What is there to be known? When you investigate more, will everyone hate my boy? Mom, he is a busy person. The things he need are in the homestead, I am taking him there. Where was Zakariya living in Dubai? At first, he had a job in Sharjah, when he lost it, he put up with a friend in Dubai, for three - four months. What’s that? It's a Rabbit Cage. There were two Rabbits- Pathu & Moidu. Some animal killed Pathu. After that, Moidu was kept inside. Later, Moidu was taken away by someone like you for some tests or so. You must have come here, reading something on social media, right? Why do you want to meet Akhila’s family? If they have some feeling against us, let them vent it out. Come, come, and chase it. No, sister. I had told him. It’s illegal to hunt the boar or deer. Don’t we know Salman Khan’s case? Powerful people like him get away, but we can’t do it, right? I somehow convinced him and we came back. Then? Then we cooked a chicken here and had it. After that I have not seen him. We are neither that close. Is there any problem, sister? Unnikrishanan told us that you guys had boar meat. If it is the cause of his infection, you also stand that chance. Alright, then. Sister, Oneday he came here with a gun, And said, "Come, let's go for hunt". Had I not gone with him, he would have shot me. Please spare me, please do not report this. You'd asked me to come by evening, when I called. What do you want? I want to have some information on Unnikrishnan. He doesn’t live here. This is my husband Govinda Menon’s house. He is no more. Unnikrishnan doesn’t come here? My husband never allowed him in here. Some days ago he came and gave me some money, but I have not touched it yet. I am a little busy, you may please go. [MOBILE PHONE RINGS] What’s it, Brother Radhakrishnan? -Yes..... Unnikrishnan, the one you were looking for, was spotted at the Taluk hospital- -on 4th May. But there is a woman who claims it was not on 4th, but 2nd May. Take that rickshaw. -Okey. Anybody with you? - No. Get in. Come to the Taluk hospital. Are you sure it was on 2 May? Yes, I am sure - because my son’s result came out on that day. Can you stop pedaling for a while and talk? Sorry. It’s school season, I am too busy. Schools won’t be opened soon, it’s a matter of the safety of our kids. Please give way. Please clear off. Why are you so late? Don’t you know how to treat for dog bite? Do what is necessary. That’s why I am here, you do not shout. Don’t be scared son, Close your eyes. Close your eyes tightly. What! What happened? Ok, then. Please try to find out that OP ticket. -Ok. In which class are your kids studying? -I don’t have kids. This is a map I prepared using the information collected by Annu as well. I have marked the travel paths of Zakkariya and Unnikrishnan. The paths have crossed many times at places like Perambra, Vayalada, Janakikkadu, Balussery. At none of these crossing points, they had met.. ..each other on same date and time. So, we cannot establish a physical connection between them. But, they have a striking similarity. Both are linked to forests and animals. Even though its in opposite ways, the possibility of them having contact with Nipah reservoirs are high. Do we have any evidence for this? Not yet. We did not get anything substantial from the examination of Zakariya's pets. Unnikrishnan had gone for Boar hunting and ate game meat. But he hasn’t done it for the last two months. There is a potential threat in this. We cannot ignore if a conspiracy theory pops up, using the travel history of both Zakariya and Unnikrishnan. How is it possible? Most patients are from the areas where both of them had recently travelled. It is enough and more for an allegation, that they were part of some network. Fruit bats from the locality are being tested for the source of the virus. If it comes negative, I would also be forced to think so. No, we shall wait. Unnikrishnan.. Unnikrishnan.. This is Dr. Annu. She wants to talk to you. You have come to treat the disease, why should I talk to you? You just treat it! I need to know how you contracted the disease, then only we can decide about the treatment. What do you want to know? Do you know one Zakariya? [COUGHS] You mean the late Zakariya? Do you know him in person? I haven’t seen him in my life. Do you eat game meat? [NODING IN AFFIRMATIVE] Do you remember what you ate last time? Who remembers? For what? It should have been excreted too. Why did you go to Perambra? I don’t remember anything. Please leave me alone. I’ve met your mother. She has not even touched the money you gave her. Why is it so? [SOBS] Is this how you treat a man who’s going to die? Why are you talking like this? Are you even a Doctor? [COUGHS] Go away, go. Go. [COUGHS] Look! Sitting in your room and seeing me here, don’t you feel jealous? Oh! What a scenery! Look! Let me tell you something, this is somewhere we had toured as a primary school student. Are you kidding me? The place has changed. By the way, what is your new Instagram story all about? What creature are you asking your followers to identify? I did not understand anything from that photo. You try. My followers should find it using their brain. How many followers do you have? How many people saw that story? It has even hit a century, you know! I don’t have 32K followers like you, Only 300 followers. And less popular than you in social platforms. Please sit. This flash drive has all the videos and photos he had sent to me. Ok, then. [COUGHING & VOMITTING] You stop drinking, go to some hospital. It’s migraine. I didn’t have breakfast today. [COUGHS] Why don’t you go to hospital? What if it’s something else? What kind of friends are you? Give me a drink. You please go, if it’s something like Nipah, we are done. [COUGHS] Yes, I have Nipah, you dog. Are you crazy? [COUGHS] [MOTOR BIKE REVS] Are you having fever? Go that way. Remove the mask. put it there. Doctor, My mother has got me only. I am not married. When did the fever start? Yesterday. Are you from Perambra? No. Have you been here on 5th May? No. Have you attended any of those funerals? No. This has been expired. Go show it there. Hello! Where are you going, without even a helmet? I am unwell, Sir. Are you drunk? [COUGHS] Honestly, I am unwell. -Blow a breath. Sir, I have Nipah. What?! Nipah?! Let's blow a breath. [COUGHS] -Blow a breath. He had temperature when came, now it’s under control. Breathing is normal. Is he agitated? No. Senses are normal, But he seems to be scared. Alright. How many patients are there in the observation? Now only him. My body might not be handed over to the family, isn’t it? Prakashan, you only have slight fever. Nothing will happen to you, the test result would be negative. I know, Doctor. I know the truth. Otherwise you wouldn’t have come wearing this. Tell me about Unnikrishnan. Unnikrishnan is a dimwit. His last case was a bike jacking. Is he a thief? Not a thief per say. He took a bike from a garage and did not return it. Later we found it from Kakkayam. When I was returning from MCH after a trip, I picked him up and together we went to Kakkayam. Did you ask Vipin, why he went to Kakkayam? No. Salih. -Sir. Call this number. -Ok, sir. [HEAVY BREATHING &COUGH] [TALKING GIBBERISH] Did they cuss my dad? I didn't steal mom. I didn't steal. [TALKING GIBBERISH] Don't talk bad about my mother. Vipin, will you speak or do we need to ask you? Sir, I did not know anything. I thought it was a normal thing. What was that abnormal activity? Roshan used to call me for his money running. He said my vehicle was safe. I too get some bucks. I thought, it was as usual at Kakkayam too. I did not know it was counterfeit notes. What is Unnikrishnan’s role in this? Unnikrishnan? Which Unnikrishnan? If Abhilash interrogates him bit harder, he will spit it out, but it’s of no use if he doesn’t know him for real. So, Kakkayam gives us nothing. Some days ago he came here and gave me some money, but I have not touched it. Let me tell you something. His mother told me that he had given her some money last time. These are the counterfeit notes we seized from Unnikrishnan’s house. Notes from the same series have been impounded from Vipin too. In another words, Roshan and Unnikrishnan got infected by the same transmission. So, the last patient Unnikrishnan and the index patient Zakariya are- -linked through this ambulance. [SINGING FOLK SONG] Brother Unni, have you reached? I am coming. Mind a drink? Not now, have to go. Take it. Alright. These are photographs we got from Zakariya’s girl friend Hifa. This is his Instagram story of 20 April, with the tagline "Identify this creature?". This has been decoded by the Police with the help of zoologists. This is a very confusing photo of a mammal. In plain sight it seems like a baby of some animal like squirrel, rat or even fox. The surface in the photograph is a tarred road, so the possibility of it being a flying creature was minimal. But in a closer analysis, we could see a possible wing like part. Bats or flying foxes are also mammals. The longer snouts give a clear suggestion of its nectar feeding character. So this is a picture of a fruit eating bat-pup. 20% of these bats we found in Perambra have been identified as Nipah reservoirs. The virus secretion will be on the higher side during their breeding season. When bats fall down, the secretion level will be very high, of their panic. This is the nearest convincing explanation for Zakariya’s exposure to the virus. All other allegations remain rumors without any evidence. Sir, Sara Yakub and Vishnu Bhaskaran, both are negative. Very good. Please email me those reports. Madam, you may wear the PPE kit from there. Let them see me as a human. It’s the protocol, madam. We should wear it while visiting the patients. They are no more patients. come. let's go. Sara, Vishnu, I did not want to leave their hands when I stood up for this speech. The reason is, nothing but the energy I got from them. No disaster can defeat us anymore. Bro, this bag, please. Today, we are sitting close and tight here. Some days ago we were fearful of gatherings. From that fearful moments, we fought hand–in-hand to get here. In this saga, we have 21 martyrs including Sister Akhila who laid lives in this fight. Their absence is an irrecoverable loss and pain for us. All of them contracted with this malady, while trying to help out somebody else. How painful! At the same time, The same kindness was instrumental in our victory over this tragedy. The memories of Sister Akhila, reminds us of that lesson. Now it’s the declaration part. I hereby declare that, the districts of Kozhikode and Malappuram are free of Nipah virus from this moment. [APPLAUSE]
