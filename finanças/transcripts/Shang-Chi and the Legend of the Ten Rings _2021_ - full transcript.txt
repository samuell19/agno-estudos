The legend of the ten rings has been told for thousands of years. Every generation, the story grows. But at its centre there is always one man. Some say he found the rings in a crater or stole them from a tomb. They gave him the strength of a god, and the gift of eternal life. He could have used them for good. But all he wanted... was power. He called his army The Ten Rings. Over the centuries, they spread into every corner of the world. They moved in the shadows... Toppled governments... And changed the course of history. He chased money and power for a thousand years. But he still wanted more. Have you heard the legend of Ta Lo? A hidden village with mythical creatures and ancient magic. Where people practise a martial arts style from the gods. I want to find it. Of course. I'll send a scout to explore the area, and come back with more information. I want to go now. The forest... ...is moving. He had nothing left on Earth to conquer. That's when he came for my home. Where's the entrance to Ta Lo? You're not welcome in our village. You don't know who you're talking to. I don't care who you are. Turn around now, and I won't have to hurt you. Is that all? That was the first time I met your father. He was the last person I thought I'd fall for. But love had other plans. Shang-Chi, there's much more to know about the legend of the rings, but you'll learn about that when you're older. If Dad's rings were so powerful, how did you beat him? Where I'm from, we are empowered by the magic of the Great Protector. When you have the heart of our dragon, you can do some amazing things. Can you still do those things? I left those powers in Ta Lo with our dragon, but what I got in return is so much better. I want you to have this. Whenever you feel lost, this will help you find your way home. Can you remember that? Okay. Hello, sir, welcome to the Fairmont... I'm driving. No, you're not... Katy. Hey, hey, get back here. Give me the key. Please open the door. Oh, my God. - Get out. - You get in! Look, if happens to this thing, we're gonna be jobless and in debt for the rest of our lives. Oh, come on. Nothing's gonna happen to this car. I'm the Asian Jeff Gordon. I don't know who that is. Most career wins in all of NASCAR history? Please get out of the car. Shaun, we've been friends for 10 years, okay? You know I'm not an idiot. Please, get in. I'll go slow. Katy, watch the... I knew Katy was trouble the first day we met in high school. I was getting picked on a lot, for all the reasons we all get picked on a lot. Plus, I had just moved to the US, so I was struggling with my English, and I was on my way to lunch one day when this guy who was like twice my size yells at me from down the hall, "What's up, Gangnam Style?" So I yelled back, "I'm not Korean, idiot." And I turn the corner, and I see this guy drop his backpack, he's getting all up in his face... And right before he was about to throw the first punch, Katy comes out of nowhere, steps right between us and starts screaming the lyrics to Hotel California. What? It's the art of confusion. Works great on stupid people. And that's how we met. Then I pulled him into the parking lot... At which point she revealed that she had also swiped the keys to the guy's Mustang. Yeah, we went on a little joyride around the block. And your wife was in the car, too. - That's true. You were. - What? I was just in the back seat. That's a part of the car. That's still a part of the car. How have you never told me this story? You know, before she was a lawyer, your girl was pretty wild. Oh! What happened? I grew up. What's that supposed to mean? Yeah, what's that supposed to mean? That maybe there's a point where you're supposed to stop going on joyrides and start thinking about living up to your potential. Please tell me you're kidding, Soo. Look, we're now living in a world where at any moment half the population can just disappear. Life's too short and too fragile. Katy, you're a valet driver with an honours degree from Berkeley, and Shaun can speak, like, four languages. You've always been the most talented people I know. I just don't get why you're scared to actually use it for something serious. Wow. You sound like my mom. You also... dress like her a little bit, too. Where's this from, Talbots? We're not running from adulthood. How is it running to have jobs that you actually like? Yeah, that doesn't even make any sense. Did you think valet parking is easy? It's like the most challenging job ever. You need people skills, driving skills... Soo can't even parallel park. Well, it's almost midnight. We got the early shift. Should probably be responsible, go to sleep. Yeah, we can be responsible. We can do that. Or... Over, sideways and under on a... Take my horse to the old town road I'm gonna Close my eyes I don't wanna... Morning, Mrs Chen. She's not ready yet. Come have some joe while you wait. Katy, Shaun's here. Yeah, Mom, be there in a minute. Ruihua, you're supposed to be helping your dad stock the shop. Mom, I can't work on an empty stomach, my legs get crampy. Maybe Shaun can help him instead of just showing up every day to eat our food. I'm happy to help. No, it's Ruihua's job, let him do it. Waipo. That seat's for Waigong. Oh, sorry. He's getting all his favourite things this year for the Day of the Dead. Are you sure that Waigong's allowed to take Funyuns and cigarettes back to the afterlife? He can take anything. Last year I put a bottle of whisky on his grave... And it was gone the next morning. I know you kids think it's silly. We don't think it's silly, Waipo. We just know Waigong would've wanted you to move on and enjoy your life. "Moving on" is an American idea. You're American, Mom! Don't forget. Shaun, did my daughter apply to any new jobs this week? She really likes her job. We both do. Mm-hmm. Waigong didn't move here from Hunan so you could park cars for a living. Well, on that note, I think we're gonna miss our bus. Mm. I'm sorry for my unacceptable job. And for staying out late last night, trying to enjoy my life. But one day, I'll make you proud, I promise. I'm proud of you, sis. Parking cars is super hard. Thanks, bro. Maybe one day you'll pass your driver's test, live the dream like me. Come on, Shaun, let's go. When are you two going to get married? Waipo, we're just friends. All right. Go, go, go. Look. Look at that. Look at that girl. She's writing a research paper on a bus. So? That is exactly the daughter my mom wishes came out of her vagina. I'm sorry about her. How's it goin'? Give me the pendant, and no one gets hurt. Do you know this guy? I don't know what you're talking about, dude. - Hey! Get off of me! - Whoa. What is wrong with you, asshole? I don't want any trouble. Then give us the pendant! You have the wrong guy! Does he look like he can fight? Come on, bro! You okay? Yo, what up, y'all? It's your boy Klev, comin' at you live on the bus. I actually did take a little bit of martial arts as a youth, so I'm gonna try and grade this fight as we're goin'. Holy shit. Who are you? You got this, bro! My bad. No, no, no! Sorry. What the hell's going on? You really wanna talk about this now? Bus driver is down. I'm not gonna handle this. Every time I've tried to drive a bus, I get yelled at. Go, you freak! Open the door, please! The back is about to go. On my signal, make a hard right. What signal? Everybody to the front now! Go! Go, go, go. What's up, y'all? What's up, y'all? What's up, y'all? You and your sister deserve what's coming. Hold on, everybody! Oh, God. Oh, my God! Sorry. Heh. We make a good team. Shaun. Hey. You need to tell me what the hell's going on. What are you doing? Where are you going? - Macau. - Macau? Those guys are going after my sister next, and I have to get to her first. You have a sister? Look, I know this is confusing. I'll explain it when I get back, I promise. No, no. Hell no, dude. This is bullshit! I have been by your side for half your life. I get there are things you never wanted to talk about, and I never wanted to push. But a guy with a freaking machete for an arm just chopped our bus in half, Shaun! Who the hell are you? My sister sent me this a few months ago. I think it's the address of where she's staying. Those guys back there were sent by my dad. What? If they hurt her... I'm sorry, but I have to go. Fine. You can explain on the plane. What? No, Katy, you can't just... You can explain on the plane, Shaun! After my mom died... my dad started my training. From sunup to sundown, I was taught every possible way to kill a man. By the time I was 14, I could barely remember what life was like before she died. That's how old I was when he sent me on my first assignment. I was willing to do anything he wanted. If he asked me to burn the world down, I would've asked him... Beef or vegetarian? We're all out of the chicken, so I can only offer you beef or vegetarian? Um... - Vegetarian would be great. - Yeah, same. - Okay. - Thank you. So... Oh, we're out of the vegetarian too. Now we only have beef. Beef. 'Cause that's all you have, right? - Okay, you'll have the beef. - Yes. - And... - Beef. - And the beef. - Two beefs. Did you go through with it? I knew that I couldn't go back to him, so I just... ran. I know this is a lot to dump on you. I'm sorry about your mom. I should also probably mention that my name's not technically Shaun. What? What is it? It's Shang-Chi. Shaun-Chi. No. Shang-Chi. Shaun-Chi. Shang. - Shaun. - Shang. Shan. S-H-A-N-G. Shang. Shang? Yeah. You changed your name from Shang to Shaun? Yeah, I don't... Yeah. I wonder how your father found you. Okay, I was 15 years old. All right? What is your name change logic? You're going into hiding. - Okay. - And your name is Michael, you go on and change it to Mishael. That's not what happened. It's like, "Hi, my name's Gina. "I'm gonna go into hiding. My new name's Gina." Can't hear you. I'm sorry. Yeah, okay. Oh, yeah, you can hear me. Sign here to get in. I'm looking for my sister, Xu Xialing. Have you heard of her? This is the address she gave me. Okay. Seems like a nice fella. And this elevator is definitely up to code. There's absolutely no chance of it just falling off the side of the building... Bus Boy! Uh... Two million views in three days, bro! Damn, dude. Oh, no. And you're the driver! Oh, my Chinese sucks. Oh, all good. - I speak A-B-C. - Oh, great. - I'm Jon Jon. - Jon Jon. Welcome to the Golden Daggers Club. Okay, let's get you ready to fight. Wait. What? We're a multi-platform global operation. Every fight livestreamed on the dark web. Thousands of viewers placing bets as we speak. This is gonna take your brand to a whole new level. Think there's been some sort of confusion. I like your spike face. Thanks! Usually, you gotta fight your way to centre ring, but a viral star like you? Front of line, baby. I'm not here to fight anybody. Okay? I'm looking for my sister, Xu Xialing. Never heard of her. We just lost a fighter at the last minute, so you get the next slot. Nice one, Helen. Is he gonna be fighting in one of these? Oh, no, no, no. These are like low-level fights. You're gonna be fighting up there. That hurt, Emil. You want me to show you how it feels? Wong! Wong! Wong! Wong! Wong! Wong! Go, Wong! I always bet on Asian. Oh, my God. Yeah, look, I'm not going up there, okay? - I'm just trying to... - Whoa, whoa, whoa. It's too late to back out now. - You already committed, bro. - What? You signed the contract, remember? Your name's on the roster. The bets are piling in. - Really? What's our cut? - Oh, it's huge. It doesn't matter. It matters. Dude, I saw you fight five assassins and a giant Romanian with a razor for an arm on a moving bus. This is just one guy. Just do it. Then we all get paid, and then I'll help you find whoever you're looking for. Come on. You got this. - You got this. - Don't be nervous. Thank you. - Yeah. - Yeah. How's the jaw? Maybe you'll start controlling those punches like we practised? Love that guy. Now take your shirt off. Ladies and gentlemen, the fight we've all been waiting for. The incredible viral sensation, all the way from San Francisco, USA, it's Bus Boy! What happened to your shirt? And his opponent for tonight, it's Macau's own fearsome killer... Xu Xialing! Sister. Wait, wait! What are you doing? I know you're upset. But can you hear me out? We don't have time for this. Ooh, that's gotta hurt. Can you please stop hitting me? Stop it! I'm trying to help you! Dad's coming for you. I'm not fighting you. You shouldn't have come back. Sometimes when I'm doing my forms... I close my eyes, and it's like I can feel her. Do you ever feel like that? No. I know what you're going there to do. I don't know what he's telling you, but Mom... Mom's dead. Please don't leave me here. I'll be back in three days. Xu Xialing, you're amazing! We love you, Xu Xialing! Whoo! You run this place? I own it. Where'd you get all that money? Did you bet against me? No. Hi, Xialing. I'm Katy. You're, like, such a badass. Everything that you do is, like, so cool. That was really cool. I like your pants. Thank you. Thanks. Yeah. What do you want? The Ten Rings ambushed us in San Francisco. I saw the video. They took my pendant. They're gonna come for yours next. I don't know what he wants with them, but we both know it can't be good. You know what he said to me when he left? "I'll be back in three days." And after three days, I went to our mom's shrine and waited. Three days turned into a week, a week turned to a month, and a month turned to six years. That's how long it took me to realise I didn't need him any more. I built this place on my own. I didn't need you then, and I don't need you now. Then why would you send me the postcard? What postcard? I didn't send you this. Is there a back exit? Shaun. Hey. Hey! Hey, open up! She's gone, dude. What do we do? What do we do? Uh... Come on! Oh, hell no. Screw you! I'm not doing this. If we make it to the elevator, we can hop in on the next floor. Katy, we're out of options. We have to go now. One, two, three. Whoa. Just head straight for that elevator. You got this. I'll buy you some time. Just keep going. On a dark desert highway Cool wind in my hair Shaun! Shaun! Shaun! Oh, my God! Ohhh! I'm coming! Shaun! Hang on. Gotcha. Shaun! Katy! You left us for dead! Now you know how it feels. What does he want with the pendant... Did America make you soft? He has the pendant! I told my men they wouldn't be able to kill you if they tried. Glad I was right. I've missed you, my son. Let's go home. My son is home. Take the girls to their room. I've seen some really scary stuff this week, but your dad's on, like, a whole 'nother level. Is he gonna kill us? Just nod. Don't talk. He'll forget you're there. That's how I survived. He always treat you like that? Only after my mom died. He said he couldn't look at me because I reminded him of her. I wasn't allowed to train with the boys. But I watched everything they did and taught myself to do it better. When did you leave? I ran away when I was 16. As soon as I knew my brother wasn't coming back. You started an underground fight ring in Macau when you were 16 years old? If my dad won't let me into his empire, I'm gonna build my own. Hell yeah. Shang-Chi. That's enough. Have you been practicing your English? Yes. You have to strengthen your mind along with your body. If you want them to be yours one day, you have to show me you're strong enough to carry them. How did you find me? I always know where my children are. I gave you 10 years to live your life, and where did it get you? Now it's time for you to take your place by my side. That's not gonna happen. American girl. Her name is Katy. What is your Chinese name? Ruiwen. Names are sacred, Ruiwen. They connect us not only to ourselves, but to everyone who came before. A funny story. Some years ago, a terrorist from America needed a boogeyman to bring your country to its knees. So, he appropriated The Ten Rings. My Ten Rings. But because he didn't know my actual name, he invented a new one. Do you know the name he chose? The Mandarin. He gave his figurehead the name of a chicken dish. And it worked. America was terrified. Of an orange. The truth is, I've had many names throughout my life. The Warrior King, Master Khan, the most dangerous man on Earth. For years, I thought that was all I was meant to be. But when I met their mother, everything changed. She showed me a part of myself I didn't know was there. It was like I was seeing the world for the first time. She gave up everything so we could be together. And so did I. You know who's in there? Say, "Hello, little sister!" After all those years, I finally found something worth growing old for. My real name is Wenwu. She was the only one who called me that. And when she died... I was lost for many years. But I'm not lost any more. When you children ran away, I was so desperate to connect with your mother, I threw myself back into the studies of her village. The legendary Ta Lo. I wasn't able to find the secret path to the village entrance, but I did find what they are hiding. There's a gate deep in their mountains. Your mother is waiting for us there. I know this is a lot. I might not have believed it if she didn't tell me herself. What are you talking about? I was sitting right here in this seat, deep in my research... and she spoke to me. It was like she was standing in this room. I could feel her breath on my cheek and her hand on my back. She told me she needs my help. To do what? To save her from her people. After we fell in love, your mother wanted us to live in Ta Lo. She asked permission from the elders, and they refused. They said I wasn't worthy. She would still be with us. We would all be living there together. Ta Lo did this to us. They locked her behind that gate to punish her. Don't you see? She's leaving clues for us. She wants us to find her and bring her home, so we can be a family again. Dad, Mom's gone. She's not talking to you from behind a gate, and she's not leaving any clues for us. Then what are these? The passage to Ta Lo is guarded by a moving maze. But there's a direct path through the forest that only opens once a year on Qingming Jie. To get through, you need to know the route and the exact time it opens. Now I know both. Three days from now, we will rescue my wife from her prison and bring her home. This is why you're here. To help me bring her back to us. And what happens if they don't let you open the gate? We'll burn the village to the ground. What? You can't just march into our mom's village with this bullshit. I mean, do you have any idea how insane... Hey! Where are you taking me? When will you stop pretending? Lock them up. It's okay, my dear. We're all going to be together soon. So, um, pretty confused right now, because, uh, initially I thought your dad should definitely see a therapist for his delusions, but then that dragon vomited a magical water map, and now I have no idea what's real. Is what he said about your mom's village true? She used to tell us stories about Ta Lo when we were kids. A village in another dimension full of magical creatures. I thought it was just a fairy tale. What if Dad's right? About Mom being locked behind a gate by her own people? Crazier things have turned out to be true. Look, I don't know what the hell is going on, but if we don't find a way to get to Ta Lo before him, he's gonna destroy everything that's left of our family. This family was destroyed a long time ago. The hell was that? Oh. You're going toward that noise? "Wake Duncan with thy knocking. "Oh, I would'st though could'st. "My deed 'twere best not..." Oh, hello, loves. What year is it? Who are you? Trevor? Slattery? The actor from Liverpool? Wait. Are you the governor's kids? I've been preparing a monologue for your homecoming dinner. Oh. Where's she going? Why are you down here? Well, some time ago, I was offered the role of a terrorist. I know, facile, trite, I couldn't agree more. But times were lean, you know what I mean? Anyway, the producer told me he worked for the BBC. But, ironic twist, it turns out he, in fact, was a terrorist, and I wasn't playing a character at all, but what I now recognise to be a rather unflattering portrait of your father. We all got our just deserts. The producer got blown up by Iron Man, and I served time in federal prison, which turned out to be the best thing for me. I got clean, I rediscovered my passion. - Then my dad broke you out? - Exactly. - To kill you. - Exactly. But just as his men were tying me up for my execution, I launched into a performance of my Macbeth. "Whence is that knocking? Wake Duncan "with thy knocking. I would'st though could'st..." They couldn't get enough of it. I've been doing weekly gigs for the lads ever since. So you're like his jester? I can give you a quick preview if you like. "Nuncle, nuncle, nuncle..." Uh, thank you, Trevor. I think we're okay. Right now, we really just need to find a way to... What the hell? What the... Oh! - Whoa! - What is that? What's what? - That! What is that? - That! That! That! You can see Morris? Morris? Oh, Morris! They can see you! You're real! All this time I thought I was hallucinating him. Oh, this is such fab news. Where's his face? He's a bit sensitive about that. Oh. Really? Morris says he knows who you are. It talks... It talks to you? If he didn't talk to me, I'd have gone mad yonks ago. How would he know me? He says he grew up with your mum. In Ta Lo. Apparently, your father picked him up in some magic forest on one of his expeditions to find the entrance. He wants you to take him home. Believe me, buddy, I would if I knew how. According to my dad, the path there only opens once a year. Oh. Morris says he can guide you there right now. You can get through the maze without waiting for the path to open. But, and it's a big "but," it's very dangerous. How dangerous? No one's ever made it out alive. But Morris is 90% confident he can guide us through safely. Oh. 19%. Look, I've done dumber things with worse odds. But even if that chicken-pig is right... ...we're still locked in your... Whew! How did you... Dad has a tunnel system under the whole compound. That's how I escaped last time. Oh. This will take us straight to the garage. Oh, my God. I kinda like this guy. Just head up that ramp and through the front gate. Should be a straight shot. Figure we got about 30 seconds until he... Do you mind? I get sick in the back. Carsick. That's my car! God damn it. Hold on. Is there another exit? The other end of the garage. But we need a fingerprint to open it. Incoming! Shit! What's happening back there? Doing my best. Scan hand print for gate access. - Hurry up! - I'm trying! Scan hand print for gate access. Shaun! Access approved. They will come back once I bring her home. Prepare the men for war. Yes, sir. The first time I witnessed pure artistry. 1968. Planet of the Apes. I was sitting in the cinema next to my mum, watching mastery unfold before my very eyes. After the film, I asked her, "How did they get those monkeys to do those things?" And she patted me on the head and she said, "It's not real, pet. It's just acting." That's when I knew. If they can teach those monkeys to act that brilliantly, just imagine what I could bring to the world. So you became an actor because you thought the monkeys were actually... Riding horses? I did. Yes. When, in fact, they were simply acting as if they were riding horses. I still can't get my head round it, to be honest. Good for you, dude. You found your passion and went for it, and eventually used it to cripple the US government, but whatever. Yeah. No, yeah, thanks. Um, this is really cool and all, but how long do we have to sit here? Morris is very clear. The way through is all about timing. Okay, but how long are we talking? Like, hours? Days? Friends, I am but a transitory vessel for the infinite wisdom of a creature far more advanced than we'll ever truly understand. What he sees, what he feels of this vast, unknown universe is beyond anything our simple brains can... Oh. You can go. What? Go. You can go. He says "go." You should speed up. What? Why? Katy, go, go, go! Morris says, - "Hard right on three." - What? Two... Hard right where? Now. And left. It's all about staying in the pocket. - What pocket? - We're in it now. What happens if we don't stay in the pocket? The forest eats us. Eats us? What does that mean? He says it eats us. Go left. - Watch your back! - Stay in the pocket. - How close is it? - Five metres. - Stay in the pocket. - What is that in feet? Really fricking close. Stay in the pocket. Will you just stop saying, "Stay in the pocket"? One last right, then straight on to the end. You might wanna hurry up. What do you think I'm doing? We're not gonna make it. I'm coming home, Mummy. Morris says, "Great job, everyone." Now, all we have to do is go through that waterfall, and we're pretty much there. Bloody hell. I think those birds are on fire. Really? Oh. Morris says it's normal. They're old mates of his. That's a weird horse. What's it looking at me for? Hi there! I am Xu Shang-Chi. This is my sister, Xu Xialing. We're Ying Li's children. This is my friend, Katy. Get in your car and go home! Please. You don't understand. Whoa. Guang Bo! What are you doing? Put down your weapons! Shang-Chi. Xialing. I'm your aunty Nan. I've waited so long to meet you. You look like your mother. Hi, I'm Katy. Welcome to Ta Lo, Katy. Oh, thank you. Look who has found his way home! I'm not a threat. Just an entertainer. Morris can vouch for me. We don't have much time. Our father is coming. Our people have been here for over 4,000 years, preparing for something we hope will never happen. We are the keepers of the Dark Gate, sworn to protect this realm and yours from the evil that's locked behind it. Our dad is coming here to open that gate. He thinks you're holding our mom there. Why would he think that? She told him. He says he can hear her asking for help. Is he wearing the rings? He hasn't taken them off since she died. What do they have to do with all this? The realm of Ta Lo stretches far beyond the shores of our small village. We have cities that surpass any in your universe, rich with culture and history. Thousands of years ago, all of our people lived in peace and prosperity, until the attack of the Dweller-in-Darkness. He came with his army, devouring every soul in their path, and with each kill, they grew stronger. After decimating our largest cities, they were headed to your universe to do the same. The leaders of Ta Lo sent their strongest warriors here to stop them from reaching the portal to your world. But our ancestors were no match for them. Until The Great Protector joined their fight and turned the tide. Together, they pushed the Dweller and his army into the Dark Gate and locked it behind them. Our people have guarded that gate ever since, empowered by the magic of The Great Protector and the gift that she gave us. Dragon scales. Makes very good armour. Your father isn't the first to come here to open the Dark Gate. Many have tried and failed over the centuries, and they all had one thing in common. They were lured here by the voice of something on the other side. A voice that promised them their greatest desires. So you think soul eaters are talking to our dad? They know The Ten Rings have the power to break them free. Oh. Here you go. Oh. To the range. What? Okay. Um, looks like I'm gonna go deliver some dragon arrows. Oh, you're gonna deliver some dragon arrows? Yeah. Make myself useful, you know. Thank you. Let's go see your mother. I just love how you guys know exactly what you wanna do, and you spend your whole life getting really good at it. I wish I was more like that. It's like every time I get moderately good at something, I just quit and start something new. But I just know my own limits, and I'm not gonna waste my time chasing something that will ultimately be a disappointment for me. That's not me. Guang Bo. Let her shoot. If you aim at nothing, you hit nothing. You were everything to her. She knew that one day you would find your way here and asked me to prepare something for your arrival. After losing someone like her, it's easy to feel alone in this world. But you're not. You are children of this family, and I welcome you home. You're not in your father's house any more. In Ta Lo, we train as equals. You've been in the shadows long enough, my child. Guang Bo, you saw that? That was tight! My mother was the only one who could beat him. Show me how she did it. No, sorry. Sorry. Offside, offside. Your mother knew who she was. Do you? You are a product of all who came before you. The legacy of your family, the good and the bad, it is all a part of who you are. Stop hiding, nephew. It only prolongs the pain. We'll be together soon. Sir. The men are ready. The passage will open at dawn. I'll prepare the vehicles. Lead with your breath. Look into your heart, the light and the dark. To know yourself, you must face them both. Your husband tried to destroy us. The Iron Gang is here to repay that debt. My husband is not the man he used to be. It doesn't matter. Your business with him has nothing to do with my children. They can go, but someone has to pay. Xialing. Shang-Chi. Go inside. I'm going to talk to our guests. But you don't have your powers. Shang-Chi, you have nothing to fear. Mama. Mama. Papa. She told me I could change. That I could leave my past behind. But she was wrong. If I hadn't taken them off, those men wouldn't have dared to do this. And now they will pay for it. Where's your boss? I don't know! I swear I don't! Okay. A blood debt has to be paid by blood. Will you help me? We found the man responsible for killing your mother. It is your right to finish this for both of us. And when you return, we will rebuild The Ten Rings to what it once was. Been looking everywhere for ya. You okay? I'm not who you think I am. You already apologised for that. We're good... That's not what I'm talking about. Okay. What... What is it? When my dad sent me to find the man who killed my mom... I told you I couldn't go through with it. I lied. I thought that I could change my name, start a new life, pretend like it never happened. But... She would hate the person I've become. Your dad trained you to be an assassin when you were seven. He sent you on a hit at 14. You realise how messed up that is, right? My mom is dead because of him. And now he's coming to destroy her home. A blood debt has to be paid by blood. What are you saying? I'm gonna do what he trained me to do. I'm gonna kill him. He's here. No! You're not ready. She stays here. Are you here to help the people holding your own mother captive? She isn't back there. You're being lied to by a creature who wants to destroy us all. Is that what they told you? I know my wife's voice. I miss my sister as much as you do, but this is not the way to honour her memory. Did you honour her when you turned her away from your gate? You fool. We turned you away. The sins of your past would have destroyed this place. Be careful how you speak to me, young man. I've lived ten of your lifetimes. Let me pass. We cannot do that. Burn it down. Stop him! Are you planning to stop me all by yourself? I'm not afraid of you. Yes, you are. You've spent your entire life afraid. Always running, always hiding. You were there when they came for her, and you did nothing. You stood at a window and watched her die! She was gone and we needed you. But you chose those damn rings over us. You trained your son to be a killer. Is this what you wanted? Even if you could bring her back, what makes you think she'd want anything to do with you? Save me. Save me, my dear. Save me. I'm coming, my love. He breached the gate! Those things are gonna kill us all if we don't work together. You think I'm going to fall for that? Your weapons are useless against them. We don't need your help. We are the mighty Ten Rings, and any... We... We should work together. Release them. Release them! What are they doing? Stealing souls to feed the Dweller-in-Darkness. If it grows strong enough, it will break right through the gate. That was just the beginning. It's too dangerous. I have to help my friends. Don't die. Everyone to the water now! To the lake! Let's go! Let's go! Hey, where's your brother? I was hoping you knew. Save me. Aim at the sky, to win or die! Deep breath. Shang-Chi, you have nothing to fear. You have the heart of our dragon. I will always be a part of you. And your dad will too. Take everything we've given you and make it your own. I'm so proud of you. Our family needs you. Go. Draw. Fire! You have to stop your father! She's not back there, Dad. Get out of my way, boy. No. Calm down, mate. I'm not dead, it's just a performance. Now get down here and play along. I have to save her. She's calling to me. I wish that were true. Dad, please. Your family needs you. Let me out! Shit. It's headed for the village! If it gets our dragon's soul, it will be unstoppable! Aim for the throat! You have to let me go. Let go! I'm not leaving you again. Holy shit. Go. Tonight, we honour those who gave their lives so we might see another day. They were more than warriors. They were our mothers and fathers, our sisters and brothers. And though we will always hold on to their memories, tonight we release them to rest with our ancestors. Farewell, Dad. Mum, we'll be okay. A thousand years ago, and a thousand years from now, we will always be together. I seriously thought we were going to die. And I'd only learned how to shoot a bow, like, a day earlier, now I'm on a battlefield, killing all these Soul Suckers with Shaun's aunty, who's this awesome, magical kung fu goddess. And I'm hanging on to The Great Protector with my sister at this point, trying not to get eaten by the Mega Soul Sucker. Oh, the Mega Soul Sucker was such a nasty bitch. Yeah. It was trying to eat our dragon's soul. Which would have allowed it to destroy the entire universe. Yeah. I only had one arrow left, and all I could hear in the back of my mind was my mom's voice saying, "Just take the shot, you little mooch!" And so, I aimed right for the Sucker's throat - and I let her fly. - She hit it dead on. And then Shaun used the Ten Rings to do this crazy Kamehameha fireball that exploded the thing... ...and he saved the world. Yeah, we, uh, lost some good people that day... but we made it. We made it. Are you done mocking me? Oh, no. We're not mocking you. So where is this sister of yours? She's back at my dad's compound, shutting down his operations. Yeah, his dad was the head of The Ten Rings for the past thousand years. Two weeks ago, you were parking cars for tips, and you want me to believe you're now saving the world from soul-sucking monsters? I know, you're trying to get me back for what I said last time, but I'm not gonna apologise... ...for speaking the truth as a friend. I really meant what I said, and, in fact, I actually think this whole bit you're doing just further proves my point. You guys are obviously... - What? - Shang-Chi. Shang-Chi. Uh... Here. Present. My name is Wong. Yeah, I know, sir. I'm a huge fan... Do you have the rings? Uh... Yeah, yes. Good. Let's go, we have a lot to talk about. You too. Me too? - I think we should... - Yeah. - Uh, we gotta go. - Yeah. I know this is, like, crazy, but I'm gonna text you, and we'll do this again. Nice to see you, John. I'll Venmo you for the... You was crusin' with your top down Fourth of July I was movin' down the block We got caught at the light Out my window I was shooting my shot Watching fireworks in the sky I'm calling it now I'm calling it now I'm calling it now You'll find love with me somehow Yes, somehow I'm calling it now In the summers we let the top down Soak up the light All I wanted was just to lock down the love of my life Nice and simple like a midnight drive Watching fireworks in the sky I'm calling it now I'm calling it now I'm calling it now You'll find love with me somehow Yes, somehow I'm calling it now Ooh, ooh, ooh Every line, every word every noun and verb can define you Ooh, ooh, ooh You were shy but you told me to pull over And now I'm right behind you We was movin' kinda fast but the feeling was right We should cruise up to Nevada Get married tonight Life is simple as long as you're in my life Watching fireworks in the sky I'm calling it now I'm calling it now I'm calling it now You'll find love with me somehow Yes, somehow I'm calling it now Hmm. They don't match any artefacts from our codex. What do you think? Mm, I'm not sure. They're not vibranium. Chitauri? Not like any alien tech I've seen. How long did your dad have them before he gave them to you? Um... About a thousand years. Their thermoluminescence indicates they're older than that. By a lot. The first time you used the rings, we felt it in Kamar-Taj. What is it? A beacon. They're sending a message. A message to where? I'm so sorry. I have to deal with this. You can get my number from Bruce. It was so nice to meet you. Yeah, I... I don't have her number. She... She does this a lot. Guys, stay safe. Welcome to the circus. I know this is a lot to take in, but you're gonna have to start getting used to that. From now on, the trajectory of your lives will be like nothing you've ever experienced before. And there's no going back. You both have a long journey ahead of you. Go home, get some rest. Yeah. That's a good idea. Yeah. Yeah, we probably should do that. Or...
