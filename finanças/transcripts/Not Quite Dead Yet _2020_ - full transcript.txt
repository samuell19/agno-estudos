You have one minute to introduce yourself. I'm Nobata Nanase, third year in the Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences at Keimei University! Boxed shumai lunch is my favorite. I eat it with side dishes. I'll start with the apricots, then shumai, then the boiled bamboo shoots, then rice. Then I hold chicken with red pickled ginger in between... then back to shumai. What I hate are zero yen smiles from store clerks... ...and Nobata Hakaru is my father. He's annoying and stinks. If I can smell him, it means that the molecules from his body will be dispersed through the air and into this body through my nose. It really sucks! That's why I have no desire to join a company where a man like that is the president! I would refuse, death! By the way, I'm in a death metal band right now. I'm shouting requiems for the world's miseries at mass. That's all, death! Right. Please come to the next mass. Our band's name is... We are Soulz! - Having fun?! - We're dying! Welcome to the mass of Soulz! You can forget all the bad stuff here! Death! - This world is full of misery! - Death! - There's always despair! - Death! - What's the end of life? - Death! - Can we sing a song? - Death! Let's go! Death! Here's "I tried Dying Once"! Not Quite Dead Yet (Ichido Shinde Mita) ~ Death, death, death, death! (Death, death, death, death!) ~ ~ Death, death, death, death! (Death, death, death, death!) ~ ~ Death, death, death, death! (Death, death, death, death!) ~ ~ Death, death, death, death! (Death, death, death, death!) ~ ~ Shut up! So stubborn! ~ ~ Do this, do that, you're annoying! ~ ~ You've been like that since I was a kid! Death! ~ "Snow White came back to life with a kiss from Prince Charming." - Impossible. - What? That's artificial respiration. Are you okay?! It's a kiss! It's a kiss! Wait. You can also think of it this way. Oh my god! Don't ruin the dreams of children. This is static electricity. Try it. The world is full of experiments and observations! ~ Life is not an experiment! Death! ~ ~ Life is not an observation! Death! ~ The color of the fireworks is a flame reaction of the elements. The color of stronftium carbonate when it burns is red. Hey, stop it. How about green? From barium nitrate! Correct! Copper oxide, titanium alloy, aluminum. Geez~ Watching fireworks just became science experiments. Be sure to become a respectable researcher when you grow up, Nanase! ~ I sincerely decline! Death! ~ ~ I don't want to listen to you ~ ~ H He Li Be B C N O F Ne ~ What's the element number? 11 is sodium, 32 is germanium! How about the time now? Silicon manganese o'clock! Correct! Stop with the atomic numbers. Everything in the world is a combination of elements. You are also made up of many elements. Okay. One, two! ~ H He Li Be B C N O F Ne ~ ~ I'm so tied up, I might throw up! Death! ~ ~ I want you to stop interfering! Death! ~ ~ I really hate you! Death! ~ Stop using phones. It will make you dumb. Stop wearing makeup. It's a waste of resource. Stop playing in a band already. Join my company and succeed my research. ~ You're so annoying, I'm gonna die! ~ ~ That's why, please die ~ ~ Please die ~ ~ Please try dying once ~ The president suddenly passed away awhile ago. Really?! Good morning. Today is Sunday, December 21. This is the morning news. "Early Rising TV". A 65-year-old woman was arrested last night on suspicion of defrauding a 40-year-old man out of a total of 8 million yen. Nishida, the suspect, who is based in Yokohama, met a man at a blind date party. She fake her age, imply for marriage, just to swindle people out of money. Currently, a fake rejuvenation drug has been trending which could be acquired from illegal channels at a high price. All of the money raised in the scam was in rejuvenation ... What do you want to do with all that money and be young? What a creep! Join Nobata Pharmaceuticals. She's been dating men under false pretenses. If this rejuvenation drug is truly commercialized, it's an invention that could change the course of human history. I hate it when people try to make money by making rejuvenation drugs. Succeed my research. "Die"... Stop saying that since you're the daughter of a pharmaceutical president. It's like you're singing that song of yours. - Stop... - It stinks. Hm? Hm? No, it doesn't stink. Yeah. You stink! Geez! You smell like an elephant poop! Hey! Stop that! Stop! The hell is that?! It stinks! Listen. This is to avoid incest. The smell would draw the genes closest to you away from the act of reproduction. It's not that I stink. Stop it! Stop spraying already! Stop with your band too. Stop sending the same message. I'm here! I'm here! "I'm here! Ah!" Stop that, Mother. Where is Father? He's still in the lab. What? It's alright. Leave him be... That's not right! He's still at work at a time like this?! President! Your wife! Sorry, I still can't go! But... Awhile ago... ~ You didn't make it in time! Death! ~ ~ You chose work rather than your family! Death! ~ ~ You are always so selfish! Death! ~ ~ That's why I can never forgive you! Death! ~ ~ Death! Death! Death! Death! (Death! Death! Death! Death!) ~ ~ Death! Death! Death! Death! (Death! Death! Death! Death!) ~ ~ Death! Death! Death! Death! (Death! Death! Death! Death!) ~ ~ Death! Death! Death! Death! (Death! Death! Death! Death!) ~ ~ You're disgusting! Death! You're creepy! Death! ~ This is death metal? That way of ending sentences is polite. Besides, you're holding up the wrong finger to begin with. Sending this to the president. Sorry! I didn't notice you at all. Ah, I'm okay. I've been called a ghost since I don't have any sense of presence. Yeah, you have no sense of presence. I'll pay for the cleaning fee so contact me later. Producer James Hotei Mr Nunobukuro, did you come here to scout? It's read as Hotei. Ho-te-i. Hotei... Even though I came to see them, I'm leaving. I heard that if they don't aim to debut this month, they will disband! Death! She doesn't have a soul while singing. To think they're "Soulz" even though she has no soul. In other words, they're just... "z". - "z". - "z". Bye then, ghost boy. They're just "z". "z"... "z"... "z"! "z"! ~ Death! Death! Death! Death! ~ "z"! "z"! You're annoying with the "z"! You've been coming here for quite awhile. What do you want with Nanase? I'm keeping my watch of her through the president's orders. Order? To watch out for her? That's quite a delusion. When your love is maxed out, you'll surely watch out for her. No, that's not it. Then what kind of job are you doing? Um... drugs. You're taking drugs?! That explains the delusion?! You shouldn't do that. Stop it. Okay, let's call the cops. I'm not taking one. Well, you see... I'm making a rejuvenation drug. Rejuvenation drug? And our company is being targeted. This guy is a complete wreck! That's bad Mr Drug. - Don't call me that! - Mr Drug! Here, drink a lot of this! I can't drink alcohol. No, I really can't drink. I just can't. You punks! Be sure to follow what I have to say to your death! Yes, Sir! When I say you gather, come here in five minutes! Yes, Sir! Mr Drug is scary... Don't move, you punk! Death, death, death, death! Death! Succeed my research! I don't know what you're talking about, you lame old man! Die already! I refuse! I don't think it's that bad, President Nobata. I refuse again! Here's your grated shirasu. Sadly, your company is the one that is leading with the research of the rejuvenation drug. But your management is too strict. How about it? Why don't you complete it with us, Watson Pharmaceuticals? That possibility... ...is like finding an octopus in the grated shirasu that it's too low! But that possibility is quite high. Huh? Then how about a small whale? - Stop looking for a whale. - I'm sorry. People are willing to spend money to be young and healthy. If there is a rejuvenation drug, only the rich who would spend them no matter what would buy it. So young! You're so young! Such smooth skin. Isn't it? Try poking my cheeks. Huh? Hm? Why did you poke me? I'm sorry. Okay, here's one roll. Huh? On my phone? Yes. Wow. Wow. Ah. How cute. Hey, I'll be in trouble! These are quite unnatural photos. Hmph. So strict! It's true that our company is strict. But this month, there would be a professional management organizer. I'm Watabe. I'll take responsibility and I'll set Nobata Pharmaceuticals straight. Your help is like a hairdryer for bald man. They're not needed. Yes. I don't understand your example at all. It means you are not needed at all. You're idealistic as always, Nobata. Then we'll take our leave, Mr Tanabe. Why did Yuriko chose an idiot like you? Stop talking about Yuriko! You'll regret this, Nobata! Say. How do you know each other? He's a junior in the same research laboratory. But things happened. Ah! President Tanabe is in the news! What?! See? Look here, it's the top news. Oh no! Why are the contents of our Romeo research here?! It got leaked from the inside. Hell Chinese Food Shop Even her part time job is hell? Stop watching me around! You're annoying! But it's president's orders. Will you kill yourself if he told you? I won't. Why would I want to die for the company. Then why are you watching over me?! I wanted to save people that's why I joined a pharmaceutical company. But whatever I do, nothing works for me. That's when the president told me he has a job for me with my special skill. Huh? And what is that? He said I have no sense of presence that it is perfect. He still is with experiments and observations. That lame old man! I will never work in a pharmaceutical company~ Sir! A plate of bean sprouts again. Eat Chinese noodles, you bean sprouts fool! Okay, only Chinese then. Come out, Chinese! Whoa! God is angry! Hey, I have a simple question. What? Why do you only spend your time hating your father? Huh? Is there anything you want to do? What? I'm here! I'm home. Die! Nobuta Pharmaceuticals Matsuoka is late. Sir. You were here? For a long time now. Your lack of presence is amazing. Well, differences of people are everyone's special skill. That doesn't sound like a compliment. "I think, therefore, I am" - Descartes. That's scary! That's from the philosopher, occult Descartes. The fact that you're bothered, tells that you exist. What do you mean? You don't exist because you can be seen. What is important is why you exist. Like what do you live for. Well, those that do not have them don't exist. They are the same as being dead. Dead... Ah! And, and, and? How is Nanase? She's "z". "z". - "z"? - Please don't worry. They don't have any soul that they can't debut. Oh. "z", huh? But why do you want me to watch for her? Well, I want her to be a researcher. But she suddenly said they're going to debut. She needs to be observed. You can just talk to stuff like that directly. Observation first. Still, she sure is brash with "Death, death". She's my daughter. By the way, I've always been wondering about this. It was always my dream to go to space. I tried making an imitation. There are still many things that science cannot explain. President. Tell him that I'm out. Excuse my intrusion! President! We should call Watson's Mr Tanabe... Dammit, no one's here. I'm here. Whoa! So you were here, ghost! Tell me if you saw our president. He already left? Huh? Huh? You changed in that small locker? It's my special skill. "People's differences are everyone's special skill." Correct~ But it's useless. Ah, right. Want to go in the laboratory with me? Okay. "z" huh? How dare he. He said we have no soul. We must get an offer to go to a major label within the year... Time to disband Soulz, I guess. - That sucks! - Right? They had to cancel Go Hiromi's Christmas Dinner Party because of a medical emergency! You're talking about that?! That's in Crown Hotel, right? ~ Japan! ~ I even bought a ticket! You really are into old men, huh? Japan! He doesn't look old, huh? Japan! He sure doesn't! Japan! Ah, suddenly, I'm free on Christmas. Japan! How about you Nanase? I prefer to be alone~ Japan! Gramps. Please call me by my real name, President. Fujii, I haven't seen you for two days. I was too busy so I died a bit. Ah, President! We should call Watson's Mr Tanabe... - There's no need! - That's right! Hey, you. How far is the rejuvenation drug, Romeo, done?! Well, while making Romeo it became a different drug. Different drug? Yes. Here. A drug that will make you die for a little. Hm? Drug that will make you die a little? Yes. You will die if you drink one pill. But after about two days, you'll be back alive. "Please read the precautions for use to pass away properly." Ding dong. Don't give me "ding dong". Why did you make a drug to die?! That will never sell! No... But then, did it have a clinical trial?! Yes. I have to try new drugs to myself. That's my rule. What? To yourself? Huh? I told you awhile ago. I said I died for a bit. You really died?! Yes. Its name is Juliet. So that it's Romeo and Juliet. Got it? How lame. Can't be helped, it's Gramps. Stop making weird drugs and make Romeo already! Romeo! Um, can I sleep like how I died for the past two days? - Huh? - Huh? Wait. Can I die like I was sleeping? It's confusing so I'll leave it to you. Ah. Okay. Then I'm off. Off to being dead. Ah, off to being dead. Hey! Don't just die and continue your research in Romeo! Currently dead This would be our last performance. Last, huh? Finding a job would be hard singing all about "Die, die". Job? Life insurance is my top choice. That would really be hard. I'm not gonna go job hunting. Right?! But I'm going to be a housewife in April! Huh? You're marrying? With who? What?! You two were going out? What? You didn't know? I'm also going to find a job in railroad. He really likes the Yamanote Line. Yamanote Line? Well, the sound of the train and drums are the same. They're not at all. Okay, I'll find a job. I'll never will. That's company prez's daughter for you. - Huh? - There also people like their life depends on it who goes to companies and doesn't have unofficial offer. Hey, is that what you really wanted to do? Then, I'll listen to you. What do you really want to do? President. President? Huh? Where is he? President... President? Hm? What is this? I told you. We must not be beaten by that president of Watson Pharmaceuticals, Tanabe. We have to find the spy quick. I have an idea. What? How about dying once? Die? Me? Yes, using this Juliet. Oh, the one from Gramps. If you die, I'm sure that one from Watson will make a move. If we observed that, we'll catch everything in one go. I see. It's truly an experiment and observation. Leave the observation to me. In two days, you'll be back alive. This is an experiment nobody has ever done! Watabe. You really are excellent! The one who knows this is only you and me. We should hurry. Let's die. Ah, wait. I have to talk to my daughter properly. No, we must fool our allies before fooling our enemies. Ah, right. Yeah, yeah. - Then drink this. - Okay. Let's see... "Please read the precautions for use to pass away properly." Ah, the precautions. You don't have to. People shouldn't just throw this away. There are important things written and people don't read. You can ignore all the details. The details are important. President, drink this. Fine. Then off I go. Since it's going to be harder when I return, you don't have to hold a flashy funeral. Yes, Sir. Ah! I have to ask you to sign these papers before dying! Hey, hey, are you asking me to work till I die? I'm sorry. What's with you? Here please. Ah! Are you okay? This too. - Here? - Yes. And also here. And the last one here please. What's going on... A little bit more, just a little bit! Okay, thank you very much! Whoa! What's this... This must be... the revolving lantern when you are about to die... How unscientific. Ah! What do you need? The chat history from Line... Please erase them... The last thing he's concerned about is Line? By the way, President. Where is the research data of Romeo? There is no data... Because it might just get hacked. Everything is written in the research notebook... Research notebook?! You sure are old fashioned... The primitive way is the safest way...! But where is it?! It's over there and locked with a password. Where is "there"? Ask my wife. But your wife is already... A! Then what's the password? The one that's most precious to me... What is it then? Here. ~ Please die once ~ President?! President! President... December 23. 2:02 PM. That is the dying time. Really?! Sadly. And here is the president's last will. "The new president will be my daughter, Nobata Nanase." "And all her support will be entrusted to Watabe." What? What? What? What? What? Me? The new president?! No! No! No! No! No! No! I don't want to! She is currently in shock. Accompany her to the president. Huh? Me? Go! Yes Sir. Then let's go, Ms President. I said I won't do it! It's alright, come on. Let's go. I told you, I'm not doing it. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Wow! I'm really dead. Welcome. Who are you?! Are you alright? I'm already dead. I'll be the guide sending you to the next world, Hino. It's unscientific. Okay. Shall we go to the Sanzu river. Ah yes. We're about to go there. Yes. Yeah. Then one boat. Okay. No, you don't have to. I'll revive in two days. I'm fine here. I understand how you feel but I just called our boat. It's crowded during the end of the year, especially now. I won't go. - Let's go. - I won't! - It's crowded. - I won't! Geez! We'll have to line up. Stop complaining, okay? Let's go. He is in the cafeteria. Cafeteria? Here. Is this really true? It's true. He died once awhile ago. "Once"? Ah, you see. His life has ended once. Huh? No way! What's with his face? I don't know... So this is the Sanzu River. It sure is. And this is the world after death. What's wrong?! I'm not going there! No! Give it up already! Come on, calm down! Stop, stop. Sit down, sit. Hm? Yuriko? Ah! Yuriko! Hey! What're you doing?! What're you doing?! Darling! - Long time no see! How are you? - Who is she? I'm dead just like always. I'm also fine but I'm dead! Ah, that's right. Which is it? I've missed you! I've missed you too but I didn't want to see you so soon! What? I don't understand your conversation. I tried dying for an experiment for two days. Huh? Experiment again? Correct! Have you talked properly talked to Nanase? No, I haven't. You're always like that! If you don't talk, she won't understand. But it's just two days. What do you mean two days? If you die now, I'm going to kill you! Your wife? She's scary. I'll be killed if I die now. I don't understand what you're saying. You're dead, right? Well, you see... You're already dead right? What's with two days? That's why don't let me cross the river yet! Don't stand, see? I really won't go! No! No! No! I don't feel good! I don't feel good! I feel sick! I feel sick! Okay! Okay! Okay! Okay. I don't really get it but okay. Stop shaking the boat. Let's go back. We're going back? Ah, we're going back! Okay, see you! See you again! - It makes me feel sick. - Ah, sorry. I have a poor stomach. Oh, really? Ah, I'm glad we're going back. Hm? Then what's the cause of death? Well, about that... Then let's do an autopsy. Autopsy? Then he'll die. He's dead that's why. No, let's not do that. Then why did he die with a face like that? Well... Because you told him endlessly to die. What? Words have souls! The power of words are scary! - Words have souls? - Yes, they have. The souls of words are scary. Death, death, death, death! Just die! This is bad. It would be better if Mr Watabe told the truth. Cold... Don't really die. Why did you die...? Why are you so selfish till the end? You lame old man! Yes, I'm your lame old man. Huh?! Why?! Why?! You can see me? You can see me? You can see me? Why? He left the company to her "Death, Death" daughter. That is so like you. Trust me, I'm going to have the board vote on this merger soon. Huh? What? Go away! Go away! No, no, no! Stop flapping your mouth! She suddenly gone crazy? This is bad. Nanase, Nanase, listen! This is an experiment! I'll be back in two days! Two days! You stink! You stink! What? You can't hear me? You smell of elephant poop! I don't stink! Huh? He vanished! Hey, who were you talking to? He was here. He was here. Yeah, but who? My lame old man! He was here! What? I guess two days isn't enough to make him go to afterlife. Huh? Two days? Hey, you're hiding something? No, no. It's nothing at all. Huh? Is your neck kind of in pain? Huh? Ah! Stop that Father! You're choking him. Huh? What? He said that liars will be killed by a curse. Ah! He's choking you! No! Stop! Stop! Stop! Wait, Nanase. Wait... President! Please stop! I'm going to tell the truth already! Tell me, tell me, hurry! Ah! You'll die! Come on! Okay! The truth is I saw everything! I saw you! Huh?! What? Experiment? He'll be revived after two days? And with the rejuvenation drug? Yes... He's horrible! Stay dead! Wait. This smells like a conspiracy! Smells like it? I've had enough of his experiments! Whoa! Stop! Stop! That's not something you spray on a person! Leave Mother alone. I'll never forgive you for doing experiments for making the rejuvenation drug. Lame old man! Wait... It smells nice. It doesn't stink. Smell? Oh, it seems like there's a smell where only a father and daughter knows. It's an elephant's...! Elephant? What're you talking about? Ah, it's nothing. I heard that when they smell that they would be able to see the soul. That's why Nanase saw me. Yeah. But she can't hear your voice. It would have been better if I talked to her first. I'm sure everyone crosses the river with that in mind. Why do people don't notice it while they're alive? But you are always like that. First time to notice it only when dying. When you notice it, it's too late. Something important to you is always like that. You thought that you can always do it anytime. Then suddenly, you cannot do it anymore. I wonder why humans can't move on without having regrets. Yeah, that's true. You don't want to die when talking stuff like this. Yeah, but I'm already dead. What's going on? It seems like nothing happened? Good morning. Good morning. By the way, heard the president died. Oh? Really? They said his cadaver is currently in the cafeteria. - That's annoying. - Wow. What will do for lunch? Hey, you can't be serious. - What will do for lunch? - You're more worried about lunch than me?! Well, the reality is more or less like this. Shall we just go to the convenient store? Convenient store? - What? - How about delivery? Delivery? Um, since the President suddenly died... But frankly, how much should we give at the funeral? Around 5000 yen. Since there are a lot of expenses at the end of the year. You should give more respect to the deceased. Can't they be a little sad? Yeah, only 5000 yen as directors. Right? Board of directors. Now that the president is gone, why don't we talk about the merger with Watson? Finally we're gonna find who's the traitor. Is it alright if we continue with the merger? - Yeah, whatever. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Huh?! - Then let's proceed with it. I'm sure the president in heaven would also like it. No, I'm not! Right, President? - I'm here! - Yeah, here, here. Dammit, Watabe! But... the president might visit us as a ghost. Yeah, yeah, yeah. He was really against it. He was really stubborn about it. Stubborn?! It feels like he's watching us closely. He sure is. Yeah, yeah, yeah... Correct! Something like that. Correct! Wait, wait... Correct! There are no such things as ghosts! It's not scientific! So we're not doing the merger. Meeting's over! Wait, wait! Hold on! Wait! Wait! No, no, no... Wow! What a horrible company. - I know. - Will it be okay? Watabe...! Wait! We're not done... You failed? What are you doing?! I'll be sure to find the research notebook! Watabe. Yes? Even if you kill a dead person, it won't become a murder, right? Yes! So there's no funeral. So they'll fry him immediately. Don't say it like he's getting barbecued. But if there's no funeral, we won't get to eat sushi. True. Sushi is delicious. There won't be free alcohol drinks too. Yeah. Since I have no plans for Christmas, I wanted to go to the funeral. True. What's this? What's going on? There will be no funeral. He will be cremated on December 25, 11AM. I think you were right. He will be cremated in 11AM? Huh? Since he died in 2:02PM... Then he won't be revived! Who will? - Come here. - Did you know? But he reaps what he sows. Huh? You won't save him? I'm not! Wait! Hey wait. Huh? What? Huh? Why won't it open? He really has no sense of presence. No sense of presence! None! None! Nobata Nanase! 21 years old! You're into death metal because you always say "Death, death"? You're quite late to be rebellious with your age. You aren't popular with the girls, are you? You never had a boyfriend for 21 years, right? I had a boyfriend! And you have a habit of pulling your ear when lying. You actually want to save him. No, I don't! I really hate him! You'll rip your ear off. No, I won't. I really like how passionate the president is. Then go ahead and save him yourself. You're really troublesome. The president wanted to talk to you before he drank the drug. What is it then? You ask him yourself when he's back, you raccoon dog bitch. Huh? People told me I look more like a cat! Raccoon dogs are mammalian cats. Raccoon dogs are cats? Hey, raccoon cat. Raccoon cat! Ah! Dammit! Raccoon cat?! You still have things you want to tell him, right? I have a lot! I'll bring him back and complain to him till he die! Let's make a plan, raccoon cat! Don't hold back, ghost! Damn your static electricity! I'm sorry, I've often been told that. Ow... Stop grinning. Merry Christmas! Bean sprouts on the house! Thank you, Sir! Two days after he died would be the 2:02PM of December 25. We have to delay the cremation before then. We have to make an excuse. Can you act? I'm really... ...good at it. You're pulling your ear. Hm? - You're pulling your ear. - Hm? I would like to... Hold a funeral! She really sucks. We should at least have one. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Mr Watabe. Let's hold a funeral. Okay then! I'm so happy! There's the zero yen smile! We'll do it then. I deeply apologize! That "Death, death" daughter made us. Reserve all the funeral homes. Hello, this is Masumi Seven Funeral Homes. Hello. This is Aoiwa Funeral Homes. Understood. Okay. Thank you. Oh no! There's no available funeral home! We won't be able to hold a funeral with this. I have one place in mind. What? Where? Japan! Japan...? ~ Japan! ~ Yes, it is open for reservation. Since the Christmas Dinner Show is cancelled. Would we be able to rent it? For what event? Funeral...? We can't hold a funeral there. Ah, yeah, I mean, a concert. Yes, yes. It'll be a mass of the death metal band, Soulz! Death metal? Mass? Soulz's Christmas Mass! Mass? What is this? And the cremation will be moved to 3PM! 3PM... Cremation Time of Revival What?! Then he will be able to revive! They will hold the funeral at a hotel. Do everything to stop it! Which reminds me... Oh dammit! All the caskets are all sold out. How about the cemetery? What about it? There are caskets there. What? Really? Yeah. Same day delivery... What?! All of it are sold out! What?! No way! Click, click... Click, click... Here's the same day delivery! Where did you get that? I'm looking forward for the Christmas Mass. We heard everything from that ghost there. Thank you guys! What's with that cheap smile? What?! They have a casket?! All we need now is a monk. Condolences Hmm... This bouquet is too dark. It's death metal! Death! What is this photo? A picture of our song jacket! - Isn't it a photo of the deceased? - We're gonna revise it! - And this is? - A ticket booth. And this is... the name of the show! This sign here is really... Ah, that is... This! ~ Death, death, death, death! (Death, death, death, death!) ~ ~ Death, death, death, death! (Death, death, death, death!) ~ ~ Death, death, death, death! (Death, death, death, death!) ~ ~ Death, death, death, death! (Death, death, death, death!) ~ Excuse me... Are you the daughter? Yes. You must had a hard time living with someone as rigid as him. Yes. Even though he's stubborn, selfish, ugly... - Hey, hey. - He... ...remembers everyone's names. It doesn't matter if he or she is someone important. He got my name wrong though. What? Really? He really worked hard to make drugs. He said that it's his job to save people. Yeah... You should do your best even if you're alone. It kind of stinks. Can you smell it? Whoa! The spraying! Wearing this seems hot. Hey, what kind of person was my lame old man? A lame old man. It's the same. Well, he's a daydreaming old man. He rans off to his dreams with everything. Dream? Yeah. To think he was very against my band! Tell me, is that really your dream? I feel like when you're singing, you don't exist. What? I don't exist? Yeah. You're wearing a flashy outfit and feel like you're just rebelling. Huh? "You don't exist because you can be seen. What is important..." ...is why you exist. Like what do you live for. Well, those that do not have them don't exist. "They are the same as being dead." The hell is that? The president told me that. Really? Daydreaming old man, huh? This looks weird, huh? Because his face is annoying. His face is annoying yeah. I wonder what's with it. You are probably hungry. Here. Ah! Isn't this?! My favorite! Really? Hey, the way you eat. Hm? Is something wrong with it? No, not really. This is really stalking. It's observation! Hey, did you know that today's the Christmas Eve? Oh, I almost forgot. - Here's the Christmas Cake. - What? So you bought one. Let's use that candle. What? Bam. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. - Here it goes! Here it goes! - Hey, hey, hey, hey... You didn't have any plans for Christmas? I had. To watch over you. What? Hey, hey, hey, hey, Matsuoka! Delicious! You have cream. This is not romcom. That was close! What the hell! Geez! Sorry, I thought there's gonna be static. Static... Why did you marry him? I felt static. Static. Please wait. This way, all that static electricity is discharged from your feet to the ground. You sure explain everything with science. Yeah. There. Okay then. I'll leave the night to you two father and daughter. What? Ah, relax. I'll be outside. Bye! There is no static! Now you're relieved. No, no, no, no... Then well, relax. I'll be outside. It's been awhile since we slept in the same room. Father... You somehow... Stink... It sure stinks. How long has it been... ...since you called me "Father"? I've had enough. Oh, this is bad. Very bad. Bad, bad, bad. Hey, this is bad. Whoa! A ghost! I'm no ghost! I'm just using a moisturizer! Okay. The schedule is being sped up! The funeral starts at 11AM. The cremation starts by 1PM. He won't make it. He's gonna be burned! - What?! - My, oh my. Cremation Time of Revival You look scary so remove that. But is there any way where we can revive him sooner? We have no choice but to ask the one that made the drug. Currently Dead Ah! He doesn't answer! - What? - Dammit... Ah, hello, hello. Yeah, 1PM then. Yeah. I'll reserve one boat please. Yes, yes. Ah! Wait! - What're you doing here?! - What's wrong? - Wait, wait, wait. - What? What? What? Watch. Watch me carefully. What're you saying? Watch me. Watch. Is this charade? Charade! Okay. What is it? What? Look, look, I'm breathing. Breathing! I don't get it at all! You really have low communication skills. Here. This looks like a deep breath. Come on. This, this. Breath? Breath! Breath, breath! Breath? Breath? It's breath! Then next. Hopping. Hopping? Hop, hop... Again? Ah! I see! Breathing again? Back to life! Poor girl. It must have been a great shock to her. Ah, um... Toothache! Oh, I'm wrong. Way, way? Ah! The way! The way! The way to bring you back to life is! Five. Three? In katakana, katakana! Trash! Yeah, that's right! Yeah! And then - caaaan! - Trash can! - Ah, that was startling! Trash can! Whoa! - What's with that kid? - Huh? Ah, he can't see me, huh? Ah, I'm tired. There it is! So what's the faster way to bring him back to life? Ah, it's not written. Wait, you have to read everything here. Yes. Ah! Research notebook! Research notebook? Let's find it! Hm? It's not here. Not here. Huh? Why are you looking over there? Don't look there... Whoa! What's this? That's during the end-of-the-year party. You sure is a pervert here. - You're horrible. - I want to die... You're already dead. Ah, that's right. - What's his password. - His birthday most likely. Don't just fiddle it. Wait. I think we should stop trying to save him! Wow! Cute! Wow! Sexy! Ah, she just sends them without asking me! Ah! You're really horrible! You've got it all wrong! No, don't spray me! Stop! Wait, wait. What're you doing? To Mother? He's sends a message everyday. "As I promised to you" "I'm watching over Nanase." "I cooked the miso soup just like how you taught me." "It should taste how you cook it." "Since Nanase is good at chemistry," "it would be great if she succeeds Nobata Pharmaceuticals." "From the medical drug to treat your illness," "I have made a rejuvenation drug." "I still regret till now that I didn't make it to the hospital that day." "I wanted to make it in time to save you." "I really regret that you passed away." I'm sorry... "I'm sorry." Yuriko, I'm sorry. "I'm sorry." I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Yuriko. "I'm sorry." "I'm really sorry..." "I'm sorry." We won't know if you didn't say anything. You're so stupid. Huh? That's why he likes to be in the locker. My lame old man... There? Please ask my wife... Hey! Where is your mother now? I'm here! Hm, what's this? "I'm here"? But where? It's here! Whoa! Huh? Password? The password is the one most important to him. The one most important to him? I'm sure that's you! I'm sure it is! Nanase... There! Oh... So it's not me... Really? Um, experiment. Observation. I'll leave it to you. Do it. Ar* y*u sure? Space. That's not it. Hmm... Hmm... Nitrogen. Oxygen. Barium... Huh? What're you talking about? Well, I think your name is made of element symbols. N, nitrogen. O, oxygen. Barium. Tantalum. - Tantalum? - Element symbol #73. Everything is an element symbol! He said that before to me that I'm made up of elements. Ah! Nitrogen, 7. Oxygen, 8. Barium, 56. Tantalum, 73. Sodium, 11. Sodium, 11. Selenium, 34! The one most important to him is? Death! Ooh! Wow! This is it! All the data of Romeo is written here. Even Juliet's data. There it is! "If a high electric current can be applied to them," "they can be brought back to life faster than normal." Let's go! Huh? We will be taking that research notebook. Th*nk y*u. What? Please spend your time at home. You should go ahead! Come on, go! It's your time of death. G* b*ck *ns*de. G*ve m* th* n*teb**k. N*te*b**k. N*teb**k. I don't understand what you're saying, you lame old man! Lame old man! Die already! How dare you! It's the "die already" kick! Meow! You're amazing, Ms Raccoon Cat. Stop with the formalities. Let's go! Okay. Hey. Don't let them in no matter what! Call the crematorium and burn the body as soon as possible. Go! It looks so lively and looks so much fun. Mr Fujii? You really came back to life... Wow, I died so well. Well, it's really refreshing if were dead for two days, Mr Watabe. Really? Huh? Don't you look a little tired? No, I'm not! How about it? Want to try dying? What're you talking about?! Stop it! You really are... What? Huh? What? Huh? Hey, it's Drug. Oh, Mr Drug? Gather a hundred people... Hundred people? Huh? Come here in five minutes! Got it, Mr Drug! Oh no! He really is a complete wreck! Oh no... I've been called up! A real mass! Come on, guys! Let's go! Let's go! Come on! Ah, hello? Um... "z"... "z" will have a concert later... Will you come? Make things tough. Hey. Prepare the mass media! Go! Go! Hey, we won't be able to get in at this state. Let's wait a bit. - Isn't this great? - What's with that portrait? A spacesuit in the tropics with perfect hair. This is too much. The tropics is actually, well... Whoa, what's this? What's this? What do you mean? Whoa, I don't want to see. What's with that mouth! I wonder why I look like that. - Wait, wait! - Huh? What? Y-You're dead! Whoa! It's true! No! Of course, I know... What's taking them so long! Let's start! One, two, three... Bam, bam, bam, bam. Don't do that! Stop! Stop! Please stop this! This is already a funeral. That's chanting. Ah, no. That's a drum solo. Drum solo? Listen closely. He's just saying the stations of the Yamanote Line. No way. Yamanote Line? Shinjuku. Yoyogi. Harajuku. Shibuya. Ebisu. It's the Yamanote Line! But however you look at it... Then how about this? Ah, this is great! I told them to not make my funeral flashy! This is... New! - It's the will of the dead! - No, it's not! You really talk like a dead person. Correct! Let us hold the mass! It is for our best friend's father! Hm... Hey! Cancel the funeral immediately! This is truly... ...a concert! You're sure about this? It's none of your business! Death! Let's go as planned. Yes, Sir. Ladies and gentlemen. This is the final goodbye. Please decorate the departure of the deceased with flowers. You owe me 3000 yen, right? I took it out from the funeral offering. Ah, I also got the interest. You will start your new journey to space. I'm sure the president is smiling somewhere in this hall! I'm here. To continue, the friend of the departed, President Tanabe of Watson Pharmaceuticals, will announce the merger with the company. Merger?! Thank you for the mass media to come here. Whoa! It's a real mass! Who are you?! Hey! Hey! Just who are they?! Hey! Hey! Now, raccoon cat! Meow! Who the hell are you?! Death, death, death, death... Ah! Why are you there?! Please let me say a few words as the family of the deceased. We don't have time for that! It's an order as the president! Death! Everyone, my condolences... Death! How are you? We're dead! Welcome to tonight's mass. We are Soulz! Death! ~ Sailor Liebe is my ship. ~ ~ Even though it might sink in the tears of the sea ~ ~ The one important to me is him ~ ~ I only realized it when he passed away ~ ~ Even though his voice is so annoying ~ ~ I can't hear it now and I'm now lonely ~ ~ I miss the ordinary happiness ~ ~ H He Li Be B C N O F Ne ~ ~ But nothing starts if I only regret ~ ~ Na Mg Al Si P Cl Ar K Ca ~ ~ I should have talked to you more ~ ~ H He Li Be B C N O F Ne ~ ~ I thought I didn't care about science ~ ~ So this world is still here ~ Hey! Stop them! We can't! Huh? This is a great concert! What the hell. So you have a soul after all! How dare you! Ghost! Since when was he there! We didn't notice him! Why doesn't he has a sense of presence! So you two were like that?! No, that's not how I bend! Stop! Stop! Please, please stop! Ah! Ah! Static electricity! This is bad. Go! Father! Hey! And now, the funeral service is over. We will now carry the casket out! Hey, let's go! Father! Come back! Hurry and burn it! - Hurry! - Yes, Sir! - Go! - Yes, Sir! But be careful with your steps! Yes! Ah! It's the bicycle from the Chinese food! Let me borrow it! Wait! That's my Chinese bike! One plate of bean sprouts! Eat Chinese noodles! You bean sprouts fool! Go! Raccoon cat! Wait! That's my Chinese bike! He's strong! Wait! Wait! What took you so long? Father! If you die now, I'm going to kill you! Farewell, President. What's that? Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas... How did you do change inside the casket?! The casket is like a locker. That's the president's special skill! Father! Since you're going to kill me if I die now. Whoa! You stink! It sure is. Watabe. It's just like you said. I will know everything if I die. What can be seen is an illusion, and what cannot be seen is the reality. The ones that are important are only the ones you cannot see. But then again I know who you really work for! A person who died came back to life after two days! This is the technology of Nobata Pharmaceuticals! Hello? It looks like I have to cancel the boat. Yes, thank you. Congratulations on reviving! Thank you very much. What did you felt when you died? Well, I finally understand once I died once. It is very important to live a normal life. How is Nobata Pharmaceutical's rejuvenation drug, Romeo? Ah, about that... I'm the new president, Nobata Nanase. There is something I realized when my father died. That is... One would not be able to convey your feelings without saying them. That's why let me say this. The rejuvenation drug is crap! And the people who are making money out of them are also crap! That's why I will personally halt its development. I want to spend my years getting old with the people important to me. I want to hear the voice of my loved ones as long as I can. When my father died and finally came back to life, I finally understand. Drugs are there so that people that are precious to you will be saved. Hold it right there! I demand the dismissal of the new president. Watabe! Look here! It says here in the president's will. "Whenever there would be a problem," "the new president will obey the most senior member present." And you signed it! Oh my. It's really my signature. So that means, the most senior member here decides. That would be me. What a pity. Nobata Pharmaceuticals will now merge with Watson Pharmaceuticals! Watson Pharmaceuticals will take over Romeo's development. Excuse me, excuse me. Ah, excuse me. Excuse me. Um, I apologize for this. What is it? I'm the most senior member. What're you talking about, kid! How old are you, Mr Tanabe? I'm 60. I see... I'm 80 years old. Huh?! I drink Romeo during clinical trials that it did a great effect on me. You're saying you've rejuvenated?! Yes. Wait! The reason people are call you Gramps is not actually from your name Fujii?! Yeah. He really is a grandpa. You just joined the company recently so you didn't know. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Tell that sooner! Um, Watabe. You're fired. What? And Mr Tanabe, the one you're looking for is there. Ah! When did you get there, Ghost?! Ah! What do you plan to do with Romeo's data?! I'll send it the next world! Death! Death! My condolences. Death! That was a lot of work. Wow Gramps, you're a lifesaver. Don't mention it. Thank you very much. Hm? It's tough to have a face like this at 80 years old. Growing old is a right that you have to have. Yes. Do you understand? - Yes. - No, you don't. - Well, she said "yes". - I think she doesn't understand. Gramps? Gramps? He has a hard time hearing. - How about it? - You startled me. Want to debut in a major label? I'm sorry but... I kind of found a job I really wanted. Oh, I see... Right, Father? Hm? If you don't say it properly, I won't understand it. What a pity... It's really a waste. So you found something you wanted to do. Japan! Japan! Japan! Japan? I wish to join your company. We'll be waiting then. Okay... What? - Huh?! - What? - Huh? Wait... - What? Oh! There are things in the world that can't be explained by science. Yeah. - I won't be going there for awhile. - Understood, death! Ah! - Congratulations in joining the company. - Whoa! You startled us. So you were there? You really have no sense of presence. Okay, let me take a picture. Here goes. She's the new employee... Death! New employee, huh? - What? - Huh? Let me buy you a suit or something next time. I don't need it. Huh? Death! ~ Death, death, death, death! (Death, death, death, death!) ~ ~ Death, death, death, death!
