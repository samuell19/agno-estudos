Oh, Harvey, You're So Incredibly Full Of anger. When are You Going To Come To Terms With That? I'm Full Of Granola. And I'm Trying To Come To Terms With Granola. I Thought We Were Going To Talk About My Needs For Once. Spencer and I Want To Split For Stinson Beach This afternoon. And He Doesn't Want To Get Sand In His Porsche. And I Thought He Was Irresponsible. Can We Have The Volvo at Least? No. Thanks. Joanie, I Don't Lend My Car To anyone With Funny Eyes. Kate, Did You ever Take a Look At Spencer's Eyes? Wall-To-Wall Pupils. Oh, I Can Really Groove On Your Sense Of Humor, Harv. You're So Sick. It's The Granola. A Lot Of Rage, Harv. A Lot Of Rage. [Dog Barking] Elton? Elton John? Granola.

Ah, Damn It. Hi, Harv. Sam, Hold On. Can I Keep This In Your Trunk Today? Sure, Harv. My Chain Snapped. Brand-New. Great. Now You Can Take Your Car Like a Normal Person. Yeah. If I Was Married To a Normal Person, I Could. But You Know Kate and The Way She Feels about Polluting The atmosphere. What Has The atmosphere Ever Done For You? Not Much Lately. You Know, Angela's On That Ecology Committee Too. Big Deal. Last Month They Saved The Condor. D'you Ever See a Condor? Not Up Close. Scare The Shit Out Of You. Harvey, Will You Be Good To Yourself and Use Your Car? Will You Take a Look at This? 6,000 Pounds Of Solid Comfort. It Takes Up Space, It Pollutes The atmosphere, It Scares The Birds. Fuck ?Em. I Love It. Did You See Carson Last Night? No, I Missed It. Johnny Had This Chick On With Incredible Jugs, And He Turned To The audience And He Says... "We'll Be Right Back after A Few Tits From Our Sponsor." Come On! I Swear To God! I Swear To God! I almost Fell Out Of Bed! Angela: Tony! Tony! Tony, What's Going On Here? Nothing's Going On Here, That's What's Going On Here. No, Thank You. Hey, I Respect Your Space. Tony, You Knew Weeks ago That I Wanted This Ready For The Wedding Reception. Angela, I'm Really Not Into This Kind Of Pressure Trip. But You Told Me It Would Be Finished Tomorrow. We Sent Out The Invitations. I'll Cop To That. I'll Take Responsibility. Sam Bought Five Cases Of Wine! You're asking Me To Pay Some Serious Mental And Physical Dues. How Much are The Dues? Well, It's Not as If I'm Making A Profit On These Dues. I'm Giving You These Dues at Cost. How Much Do These Dues Cost? 200 Bucks. You Got It. Prick. Sam, Do You and Angela Spend a Lot Of Time Having Meaningful Discussions About Your Marriage? You Didn't Get Laid This Morning Either? No, No, I'm Serious. Angela and I Don't Have To Talk About It anymore. All We Do Is Look at Each Other. We Know We're In Hell. Well, What Is It? There's Something Crazy Going On, And I Don't Think It's Us. Believe Me, Not Getting Laid This Morning Has a Lot To Do With It. That Is Certainly Part Of It, Yes, But It's More Than That. When I Start Getting Laid Every Morning, Then I'll Start Looking around For The Other Part. Harvey, I Figured It Out Once. From The First Time You Whack Off To That Final, Feeble Fuck, A Man Has Got Maybe Seven, Eight Thousand Bullets In The Old Pistol. I Got a Thousand, Fifteen Hundred Left. At The Rate Angela and I Are Going, When I Die, I'm Gonna Leave Behind a Major Munitions Dump. So We Both Said Hey, We've Got A Caring Relationship. We're Each Willing To Give The Other The Space To Grow And Nourish Our Basic aloneness. Why Not Make A Total Commitment In a Legalistic Sense? So Tomorrow's The Big Day. I Can Dig It. Who's The Chick? Martha Stearns. No, I Don't Know Her. She Used To Be Martha Byers. No, I'm Not Familiar. Well, Before That, She Was Martha Crimm. And Before That, Martha Peel? You Know Her? I'm Fred Peel. Right. Her First Husband. No, Her Second. Right. Well, Hey, Stokeley, What's Happening, Babe? Nothing. Darling, Will You Excuse Leonard and I For a Minute? We're Gonna Have a Private Rapwhich Doesn't Concern You. Bullshit. Good. That's Cool, Martha. Stokeley's a Patient. I'm His Therapist. He Knows Why He's Here. Why Don't We Informally Dialogue about It Then Stokeley and I Can Go Inside and Rap In a More Structured Manner? Right. This Morning I Caught Stokeley... Not In The Sense Of Spying, You Know How I Feel About Violating a Child's Space. I Hear Ya. This Morning I Caught Stokeley Dealing With The Maid As a Sex Object. Of Course, For Her Own Protection, I Had To Let Her Go. You Were Reaffirming Her Selfhood Without Denying Your Own Power Perimeters. Exactly. Good Girl. Now, As Far as Stokeley's Concerned, It's Just a Question Of Puttin Him In Touch With His Childhood. I'm Only Ten Years Old, You Dork. Well, Then We Don't Have Too Far To Go, Do We? Schmuck! Perfect! [Streetcar Bell Ringing] Ok. Bye-Bye. Great. [Mumbling] Typing... 50 Words a Minute. Shorthand Is 40. Let's Face It... Uh, Harvey. Harvey. Secretarial Skills Suck. Mm-Hm. You're Kind Of Cute, Though Hey, You Know That? Uh, You are Real, Uh... Cute, Too, Stella. But, Darn It, This Job Calls For Someone With Skills. Don't Worry, Harv, I'll Fake It. When Do I Start? Oh, I Wish It Was That Easy. But I Have Got all Of These Other Girls To Look at. Ok. Hire One Of Them. See You Around, Harv. You Know, Stella. I Seldom Speak More Than 40 Words a Minute. Ok, Harv. When's Lunch? Oh, Yeah. Man: Uh, Shin Splints. [Man Chatting, Indistinct] [Horn Honks] Hey, Watch It! Rachel? Hi. Oh, Hi. I'm Martha Stearns. Get In. I'm So Glad You Were available. My Regular Maid Maria, Uh, Quit, Suddenly Gone Back To Panama. And You Won't Be Lieve The Next Few Days. My Consciousness-Raising Group Is Probably... Waiting at The House Right Now. And I Have To Get Everything Ready For a Big Wedding. Oh. Mine. It's Not Far Off. Oh, Wonderful. Rachel. Hmm? This Is Gonna Be Hard To Verbalize So I'm Just Gonna Be Right Up-Front With You. I Realize What Kind Of A Statement You're Making And I'm Sure It's Valid For You, But... I'm Having Some Problems With It. With What? The Uniform. Well, What's Wrong With It? Oh, It's Not The Uniform, It's The Idea Of The Uniform. Oh, You Want Me To Wear Regular Clothes So People Will Think I'm Just Your Black Friend Who Dropped By To Clean Your House ?Cause I Ain't Got Nothing Better To Do. Would You? [Women Chatting In Next Room] Martha: Completely Negative. Everything I Did. Carol, I Swear. When It's Your Turn To Bring The Goodies, Your Taste Just Boggles Me. Oh, Really! Look at This Brie! It's Gorgeous. I Could Make A Meal Of It. Well, Enjoy It ?Cause It Almost Didn't Get Here. This Kid at The Market Had The Hots For Me. I Mean, He Followed Me Out To My Van Even. I Practically Had To Hit Him With The Groceries Just To Get away. Like I Said, It's a Problem Sometimes, But Tell Me, Carol, I'm Dying To Know... How Do You Cast A Spell Over Men? First, She Grabs Their Balls. That's a Really Negative Comment. Well, Most True Things are. Don't Be a Bitch. A Bitch?! Wait, Wait, Wait! I... I'd Like To ask a Question. I Mean, Not To Put Down The Group Or anything, You Know, But We Have Been Coming Here For Months, Rapping Like This, And I Just Get The Feeling That We Should Do Something. Like What? Hold a Bazaar? No, We Come, We Talk, We Tell Each Other How Pissed Off We are, And Nothing Happens! Spare Me The Jane Fonda Impression. Excuse Me, Mrs., Uh... Martha. Oh, Rachel. Hello. Oh, I'd Like You To Me Et Some Friends Of Mine. This Is Vivian, Carol, Angela, Kate. Hi. Would You Like Some Coffee, Rachel? I Don't Know... Absolutely! We're Just Raising Our Consciousness Here. What's That? What's That? Rachel, We're Rapping about How Women Have Changed. We're Not Buyingthat Drudge Bit anymore. We're Not Just Taking Care Of Kids and Cooking, Mopping Floors, Scrubbing Toilets... Right. Where's The Comet? Fuck The Comet. Sit Down, Rachel. Now, Rachel, You Don't Have To Talk Unless There's Something You Really Want To Talk about. For Instance, Rachel, I'm Marrying Bill, And I Guess I Wanna Talk about Why I'm Having Trouble Talking about It. Well, Could Be Because Bill Was Married To Vivian For 10 Years. Right? Vivian and I Got Clear On That Months ago. I Think It's Really Nice That Martha Is Carrying On Vivian's Work With Bill. Darling, as I Recall, Martha Came To Work Early. That's Not Fair, Vivian. You and Bill Had an Open Marriage at That Point. Bill Had An Open Marriage. I Had A Yeast Infection. Look, Can We Get Back To The Point? I Mean, Martha Has Her Doubts, And I Think They're Valid. I Mean, Does She Want To Wind Up Like Kate? What's Wrong With Kate? I Don't Think It's Kate. I Think It's Harvey. Of Course It's Harvey, I Mean, Harvey's a Drag. Harvey Is Not a Drag! You... Uh... There are Certain Things That He... He Has To Work Out. Axelrod Has Been Having A Problem Lately. [Whistles] Very apt, Carol. Very apt. God, You Don't Hold Nothing Back, Do You? Isn't It Beautiful, Rachel? Women Feeling Free To Say Whatever Crosses Their Mind. How's Your Sexual Relationship, Rachel? For Instance, What about This Morning? He Was at Work Before I Woke Up. How about Last Night? He Brought Home a Six-Pack, I Made Pizza. We Watched Merv Griffin, Then He Looked at His Watch Like He always Does And Says, "Well, It's Time To Play Hide The Salami." He Makes Sam Look Like Cary Grant. I Didn't Mind. Didn't Mind? Rachel, It's Supposed To Be A Richly Fulfilling Experience. I Mean, First, A Tingling Feeling, Then Wave after Wave Of Beautiful... Oh, That. It's Called An Orgasm, Darling. I Know, I Had Seven Of ?Em Last Night. Seven? Since We're all Being Perfectly Open With One another, I'm Sure Rachel That Will Be Willing To Tell Us, Purely From a Socio-Cultural Overview Of Course, If all Those Stories We Hear About Black Men are True. I Have No Idea. I've Never Been To Bed With anyone But Wong. All: Wong? Fellow Members Of The Human Community. This Is a Wedding Of Two Separatenesses Under The Cosmos. Now, I'm Not Going To Pronounc These Children Married. Great, Let's Go. Come On, Harvey. Only They Can Do That. They are Now Going To Recite Their Vows. Martha. You-Ness, Me-Ness, Us-Ness, We-Ness... [Snicker] Your-Ness, My-Ness, Our-Ness. Happiness. Sickness. Harvey. Now, Bill, I'd Like To Hear Where Your Head Is at. Thank You, Martha, For Pushing My Button, Thank You For Inviting Me To Participate In Your Life, For I am an asshole, And Being an asshole Is Neither Good Nor Bad. It Just Is. I Think That Says It all. These are Exciting Times, Aren't They? Gas Is Over a Dollar a Gallon, And It's Ok To Be an asshole. Shh! I Now Pronounce You... Pair Bonded For as Long as Your Relationship Continues To Be Mutually Nourishing. [Applause] That Spike Is A Really Spiritual Person. I Wonder If He Fools around. Isn't This Beautiful? Friends and Family And Music. The Idea Of Telling Someone That You're Gonna Love Them Forever. Kate, Have You Noticed How Martha's Forevers Tend To Last About Two Months? Yeah, Well, at Least She's Not Afraid To Make The Commitment. Vivian, I Want You To Know That During The Ceremony You Showed a Terrific Sense Of Dignity And Maintained A Nearly Perfect Center. Thank You, Leonard. Coming From You, That's Totally Unnecessary. Well, Were You Properly Moved, Sam? Do You Believe This Garbage? Kate Loved It. Oh, Boy. Who are They? Weekend Freaks. No, They're Gay. Homos? Yeah. Well, No, No. During The Week, They're Completely Normal. But On Weekends, They Dress Up Like Hell's Angels And Listen To a Lot Of Judy Garland Records That's It? And They Beat The Shit Out Of People Who Offend Them. You Mean No Decorator Jokes? No. What The Hell Are They Doing Here? Well, They Came To See Spike. You See That Guy In The Silver Helmet There? That's Skull. That's Their Leader. He's Got a Crush On Spike. So Spike Is A Little... Oh, No, No, No, But Skull Is Sure Gonna Try To Change That. Now There's a Wedding I Would Pay To See. [ Disco Music Playing] What You Got With Meat In It? Nothing. Try This Lentil Loaf, Man. No, Thanks. Leonard, Have You Seen Kate? Yeah, But Not Nearly Enough. You Know, Harv, I Think Kate Should Come and See Me Three Times a Week. Sustained Therapy... Leonard, Leonard... Lenny! Here. Now. No. Spike? Hi, Harv. Great. Thanks. Carol. Carol? Have You Seen Kate? Oh, Harvey. I Don't Think I've Seen anything In The Last 20 Minutes. That Spencer Deals Some Heavy Shit. Ha Ha. I'm Telling You, Joanie, I Know One When I See One, And Harvey Is One. For The Last Time, Spencer, My Father Works at Wells Fargo. He's Not a Narc. Just Look at The Man's Shoes. People Don't Buy Shoes Like Those. Want To See a Narc? This Guy Coming Over, He's a Narc. Jim Is No Narc. He Used To Be Such a Stoner He'd Come To Parties With a Seeing-Eye Dog. Hey, Jim. Say Hello To Joanie. Hi. Hello, Joanie. So, Where Have You Been? Oh, I've Been Getting My Life Together. It's all Beautiful Now. Oh, Right. Did You Make That Big Score? Oh, No, Spence. I'm Out Of That. I'm Living With Some Beautiful, Loving Peop Le. We Have a Big House In The City. "Church Of Oriental Harmony." I'm Not Into Organized Religion. Come See Us, Joan. You'll Like Us. Sam, Get In That Tub. Angela, I'm Not Gonna Do It. Maybe I'll Try When Everybody Goes Home But Not In Front Of all These People! It's No Good Unless a Lot Of People Get In It Together! What's Everybody So Uptight about? All Right! I'll Do It! I Need You To Help Me With The Hors D'oeuvres. Oh, Sam, It's Good I'll Be Back. Look, I'm Ok, You're Ok. Ok? No, You're Not Ok. Ok? Ok. So Long, Spike. Harv. Yeah. You Know What I Think? It's Beautiful. I Think It's Wonderful That Martha and Bill Have a Marriage Contract That Spells Out Everything. I Wish We Had a Contract. You Mean Like Who Takes Out The Garbage? That Kind Of Everything? Every Kind Of Everything. How Often? Who Starts It? Everything. You Mean Nooky? Sam! Sexual Responsibilities Are Covered, Yes. He Means Nooky! Oh, Sam, For God's Sake! Where Do I Sign? It's Gotta Be Better Than My Present Deal. Where Have You Been? Where You Weren't. I Don't Want Any Trouble. Well, Thanks. I Had To Talk To That Idiot Leonard. See? That's What I Mean. What? You're attacking Leonard. I'm Not attacking Leonard. I'm Supporting Leonard. I'm Giving Him $240 a Month Every Month For Your Therapy. Oh, Well, I'll Pay For It Myself. With What? I'll Get a Job. Doing What? You've Got a B.A. In Literature. You're Gonna Go Door To Door a Explain The Hidden Meanings Of Huckleberry Finn? A Lot Of Rage, Harvey. A Lot Of Rage. Harvey: 8:30. I Wonder If Bill And Martha are Still Married. Kate: Do You Care? No. I Just Wonder. [ Music Playing] [Dog Barking] Harvey: What The Hell Is Going On In Our House?! Jesus Christ! No. No, Thank You. What's Going On Here? Harvey! Joanie. Joanie! Harvey! Joanie! Harvey! Get Down. No... Get Down! All Right, all Right. He Didn't Mean It. Spencer! Hey, Man, Just In Time. We're Out Of Beer. When You Wanna... Shut Up, Spencer. I Don't Believe This. Will You Just Take It Easy? You Don't approve Of This, Do You? No, But There's A Way Of Handling It. Right. How's This? All Right! Everybody Out! Come On, Out! Out! This Is a Private Home! [Music Stops] Bye. Nice To See You again. Joanie! What Is This? I Hope You Had a Good Time. Where Do You Find These People? Under Rocks, Or Something? Off My Bike! Hey, Uncool, Harv. Spencer, Get Out Your ass Out Of This House Now! Stay Mellow! You're Really Sick, You Know? You're a Sickie On a Power Trip. Sit Down. Harvey! I'll Do This! I Wanna Talk To You. You Don't Talk To Me, You Talk at Me! What's The Difference? You Don't Listen anyway. Because You Don't Make Any Sense. Try This. I'm The Father And You're The Daughter. Why Don't I Make You Real Happy And Just Split? Joanie! Joanie, You're Grounded! [Dog Barking] I'm Not Finished! Oh, Yes, You are! You Know What You've Just Done To Her Peer Group Dynamic. Her What? Her Socialization, Her Individuation, Not To Mention The Father-Daughter Interface. What are You Talking about? What Is "Interface"? A New Word For Oral Sex? Kate, For Christ's Sake, Can't You Just Speak English? All Right. I am Tired Of Living With Someone Whose Mind Is Closed, Who Is Unwilling To Grow And Will Not accept Reality. What Reality? Coming Home and Finding Out That My House Has Been Turned Into an Opium Den After Watching a Couple Of Self-Proclaimed assholes Getting Pair-Bonded By a Priest From The Gong Show. Kate, Do You Call Lentil Loaf Reality? I Call This Reality. I'm Unhappy, Your Daughter Is Unhappy, And apparently You are Unhappy. Well, My Unhappiness Counts around Here. You're Not Hearing Me. I Heard The Part about My Not Being Happy. Oh, Yes, Take It Back To Yourself! We Were Talking About Me! I Might as Well Talk To a Wall. I Might as Well Sleep With One. Oh Ho Ho! Well... Oh, That... That's It, Harvey. You Move Out Or Do I? Who Is Talking About Moving Out? I've Never Felt Such Hostility Towards Harvey Before. [Sniff] You Felt This Incredible Hostility. Right. So I'm alone Now, I'm Picking Up The Pieces. And, Well, Joanie's No Help. No Help at all. You Know, Of Course, She's Confused, She's Not Home M'Uch. She's Gone. I Don't Know If She's Trying Lay a Guilt Trip On Me Or What. Who Knows? I Just, Uh... Phew. I Can't Handle any More Emotional Input Right Now. I Really Can't Handle It. You Can't Handle Any More Emotional Input. Not Right Now, You Just Can't Handle It. That's It. I've Got Enough On My Mind. I am alone, I've Got Money Problems. You Got Money Problems? Yes, Sir. Mr. Luckman Will See You Now. Sir? Oh. He Left. Ha. It's Me. Thank You. You Know Why They Call Me The Head-Hunter, Holroyd? No. No, I Don't.

I Think I'm In a Place Right Now, In My Life Where a Change Of Jobs Is Important. You Know, It's Funny, I Hired a New Secretary, Here I am Looking To Bust Out, But, Uh... I Feel I Have Talent.

You Know, Gay Or Straight, Um, You Still Have That Certain Something. You're a Cunt. Still? Work On It. Kate, We Need Harvey. Where Is He? I Know We Need Him. He's Comin He'll Be Here any Minute. Born To Be Wild Martha: Kate, Peopleare Getting Into A Really Heavy Eating Trip. Well, I Know, But Don't Worry, He'll Be Here. He Said He Was Coming. Man: Hey, Look! It's Skull! Oh, My God, It's Harvey! He's Got Joanie! He's Got Joanie, My God! Oh, I Love It! Fellow Beings... We are Here To Celebrate a Wedding. Not One Imposed By An Uptight Consumer Society Which Kills Whales, Builds Nuclear Reactors, But a Real Marriage. Will You Touch Each Other, Please? Beautiful. Harv... Can You Relate To Making A Heavy Commitment To Share Your Space With Kate, Respecting Her Identity As a Free Being? No. No? No. I Promise To Love, Honor, and Cherish Kate Lindell Holroyd, In Sickness And In Health, For Richer, For Poorer, Forsaking all Others, For as Long As We Both Shall Live. You asshole! Woman: Oh! Uncalled For. Man: Uncalled For. Kate... Will You Tell Us all Where You're Coming From? I Think Harvey Took The Words Right Out Of My Mouth. All Of Them? Including The "asshole." Harvey: Honeymoon Time. Come On. Friends... and Neighbors... It's Been a Slice. [Chatter] Harvey: We Can't Make It Here. We Gotta Get away. Kate: I Know. You Do? Yes. Well, Then What Do You Guys Think About Denver? Denver? What's In Denver Except a Lot Of Snow? Well, My New Job And Our New Place, And Joanie's New School. It's Gonna Be Rough at First, But I Think If We Keep an Eye On Our Spending We're Gonna Be all Right. It Won't Be That Rough. I Gotta Hand It To You Guys... You're Weird But You've Got Balls. Thank You, Joanie, But Watch Your Language, Ok? They Don't Talk That Way In Denver. Denver. That's Near Aspen. Yeah. Isn't That Where They Have The Institute For Humanistic Studies? I Hope Not. You Know, It'd Be Sort Of Good For Us, Relating To a Community That Isn't... Well, You Know, Superficial. Harvey: Hey... It's a Changing World That Greets The Day It's a Changing World And It Spins away And You Hold On Or You Fall Off You Hold On Or You Fall It's a Changing World And It's Moving Fast And The Love It Brings Doesn't Seem To Last But You Hold On Or You Fall Off You Hold On Or You Fall You Think You Got It Made You're Master Of Your Fate You're Doing It Right Then Overnight Your Life Is Out Of Date And So You Face The Facts Your Future's On The Line You Either Get In And Run The Race Or You Get Left Behind It's a Changing World And It's Been Fun It's a Crazy World But The Only One So You Hold On Or You Fall Off You Hold On Or You Fall Yes, You Hold On Or You Fall Off You Hold On Or You Fall
