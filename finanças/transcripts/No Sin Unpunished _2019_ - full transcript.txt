Claire. Claire. Claire, Claire wake up. Wake up, wake up, Claire. Claire, wake up. Baby. Baby. Baby. Baby. Please, ah. Who's baby? I don't know. Baby, baby Huh. Well, I'm not gonna get any sleep tonight. Yeah, no, I'm sleeping with all the lights on. Why do we do this to ourselves? It's fun. Oh shit, we're so late. I feel like I lost my voice from screaming so much. Okay, back to the real world. Why do we still work here? Oh, because it's a fabulous salary. Uh, I can't wait to leave. Do you think your boyfriend will be here tonight? He's not my boyfriend. Really? Because you stare at him like you want him to be. He's pretty cute. Oh Hero, oh my Hero. I'm sorry. So what time tomorrow? Six, if we're gonna find a place to park. Drinks first? Make it five, then? Beautiful. Bye, slut. Love you, Maggie. I love you too. Hey Taryn. Sweetie, can I get a cup of coffee over here? Yeah, I'll be right there, Neely. Taryn. I know. You're 10 minutes late. I know, I'm sorry, man. I got a restaurant full of people here. I got it, Rodney. How's the search going? Actually, I think I've narrowed it down. Really? Do you know that old drive-in movie theater at the edge of town? The Starlight? I just came from there. And? And I've always thought that place was pretty special. Been going there since I was a kid. Hey, I could use some more coffee over here. I'll be back. How's your chicken parm tonight? It's the same as it always is. Charlene still taking care of her mom in Lagrange? Yeah, and her sister still has the kids. Who's the drifter? Drifter? Oh, wrong guess. That's Hero, he's an archeologist. He has all kinds of college degrees. Hero? It's just a nickname. His real name's a jaw buster, it's Her, Hieronymus? He's kind of shy, but once you get to know him, he opens up. Has he been coming in regular? About three weeks. So what's he here for? Guess he's trying to find some stuff. He's looking for this ancient civilization. 14,000 years old. And he thinks he's found it, right here in Carverstown. He's gonna put this place on the map. He sounds like just another nut case hitting on you. What time are you getting off? Same old time. Same old time, why? So I can pick you up. I might have other plans. Oh, you fixin' to be mean to me. Your wife's my second cousin. That's never bothered you before. Well maybe I've done some growing up since then. Why don't you tell me all about it at midnight. Order up. Eat your chicken. Everything okay? Sure. Is that where you think it is? If not, I've wasted two years of research. But, when I'm there, I feel it. Feel what? Emanations from the ruins of a city buried 14,000 years ago. But whatever's left is discharging enough energy to make my skin crawl. I mean, I'm naturally sensitive to the earth's energy fields, but this place, it's almost enough to knock me on my ass. So what happened to it? Believe it or not, earthquakes strong enough to move mountains. There's earthquakes in Georgia? Well, seismically this area was very, very different back then. So these visions, is it like being psychic? Well, neurologically speaking, I'm epileptic. When I have an occurrence, a seizure, I see things. People, events, places, past, present, future. It's never the whole thing. Just quick flashes. Order up. Okay. Here, let me top you off. Ah, ah. Sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Hero. Somebody help. Rodney, somebody call 911. Hero, can you hear me? Hero. Hero. So he's already been discharged? Did he leave an address or maybe a phone number? No, this is very important. I have something he needs. Okay. Thanks anyway. Damn. No luck. Well, he'll probably be back for his glasses, right? Listen, I wanted to show you something. I found that on the floor. He was showing this to me earlier. What is it? Do you have any tape? Yeah, I think so. I bet you good money I know exactly where he is. Yeah? I'll just take it to him on my way home. Were you planning on stopping by? I mean, why bother? Because I need to know he's okay. Hero. Hero. Hero? Hero. Taryn? Goddamn it, Hero. Sorry. What are you doing here? I brought you your glasses. You shouldn't be here. Hero, look out. Hero. Oh my God, Hero. He's not dead. I don't want him dead, yet. Why did you do that? We didn't do anything. Liar. Our Lord did not bleed for you, so can throw His mercy back in His face. Is he your, your newest? Hero and I never-- You get tired of being defiled by that son of a whore, Neely Blasemore? There were so many. And you took your, your goodness, your sweetness. Neely's been done for a while. No, how many have there been, huh? I seen 'em. I seen 'em all. You're right, I'm sorry. I'm sick. I need help. God's help. Please help me, John. Please, John, please. Help me. No, you can't be helped. Who do you think made me this way? Go with God, if He'll have you. Oh my God. What? Oh my God. No, I-- Hey. Hey, hey. Hey you. Thy steadfast love, oh Lord, extends to the heavens. Thy faithfulness to the clouds. Thy righteousness is like the mountains of God. Thy judgments are like the great deed. Man and beast thou savest oh Lord, how precious your steadfast love. Thank you, Brother John, for that eloquent reading from one of our favorite Psalms. Now let us turn to hymn number 79. So, that's the last time you saw her? I just can't believe it. So Megan, did Taryn call or text last night. Um, maybe. It's just the usual trash talk gossip, you know? So she didn't mention having a late date? Mm-mm, I would've been the first. We've been friends since fifth grade. Blood sisters we called ourselves. We did this stupid blood oath. Still have a scar. Taryn, Taryn, she was squeamish about being cut. She was very dear to us, Megan. Pauline and I loved her as if she were our own, you know? She was such a blessing to Pauline, God rest her. We couldn't have children of our own. Taryn's tragic loss for a family was God's blessing to us, you know? I hope she had only good things to say about the years she lived with us. She didn't talk much about personal stuff. You know how she was. I'd spend hours trying to cheer her up and, Sheriff, can I get back to work please? In a moment, Megan. I'm just trying to establish Taryn's whereabouts after she left the diner last night. Excuse me, John. We talked to Rodney. There was something going down here last night that might have to do with the case. Like what? There's this hippie who was taking his meals here for about three weeks. Hero? You know him? I've seen him a couple times. Can you describe him? Shy, I mean unless you had him warmed up about his favorite topic which is velocities of Atlantis. I meant, physically. Oh, hmm. Tall, thin, lots of hair, glasses. Fits the description we have from the witness. Also he's an epileptic. Had a seizure here last night. Medics scooped him up, but he was out of the ER in a couple hours. Did you get a phone number or an address? No, but we're getting a copy of his insurance card. I might know. I mean, he talked about the Allatoona Camp Ground. I guess they rent cabins by the week and-- Dispatch, who do we have right now in the vicinity of Allatoona-- Hero couldn't have done this, though. This guy wouldn't hurt a fly. Well did, did Taryn have a, you know, a crush on him. She didn't say anything to me. If anything, he brought out the mother in Taryn. You know how she was, stray cats and dogs and stuff. Like that was her biggest flaw. Thank you, Megan. Hero, look out. I don't want him dead, yet. Clear. Got his meds, Diazepan. Good, he'll probably try to refill that if we don't catch up to him first. It looks like we just missed him. Yeah, sun's gonna be down in about an hour. We need a search team here pronto. And get Charlie Hodge up here with his dog. Yes, sir. Okay, okay. Where am I? Okay. Latitude. Longitude. Okay, nearest town, Eddysville. Three and a half clicks north, northeast. Okay, that's good. And that is really, really bad. Okay, okay, think, think, think. Okay, do I back track down the creek? That's not gonna fool those dogs for long. You? It's me. You can't be. I'll explain later. Oh my God, but you're-- Stop gawking. Run like hell, find Jacob's bus. But how? That way, half a mile. Find the damn bus. I'll take care of the dogs. Sheriff? Yeah, go ahead. Them damn dogs are red hot on his trail. Can't be long. Just let the dogs off the leash, they can get to him faster than you can. That ain't highly recommended, Sheriff. These shepherds will tear him to pieces-- Well not if he has enough brains to climb a tree. Come on, boys. Saddle up. Oh my God, there is a bus. Stick him, boys, get him. Come on. Well, here you is at least. I begun to have my doubts. Taryn? Oh, she'll be along directly, no worry. Man, that's sho enough the hounds of hell. You best get on board now. Where are we going? A more commodious place than you at right now. You got my guarantee on that. Where is she? Right here. Where am I? No, no, wrong question. Where are we? It's all a reality field. Jacob, did you not tell him anything? Reckon I'd leave that to you, missy. Sure, since I'm the expert. I did just die a few hours ago. Taryn, I-- Hero, you really should get a grip on something. Wait, what? Jacob's about to haul ass out of here. Yes, ma'am. Never changes. Thanks for the warning. I told you to grab something. What is that smell? That's the scent of violets. No, don't touch me, I'll disintegrate. Different energy fields, it'll take hours to pull me back together. How did you find me? Astro configuration. Trust me, it's nothing that teach at Princeton. Hero, we've got a problem. Seems like we both do. Sheriff John Stone. Listen, as long as you're still alive we can do something about him. Place the blame for my murder where it belongs. Otherwise, I am doomed just like the rest of them. Who? Take a look around, Hero. Where did they come from? They got on here and there while you were nodding off. Nodding off? It's happened six times since we've been talking. There, you just did it again for a couple seconds. I mean, in your time frame and velocity of course. So, my funeral is in two days. Once I'm in the ground, I only have two options left. The better place, it does exist, Hero. Or I become one of them. And am restless and earthbound with nothing but John Stone on my mind and nothing that I can-- Hero, wake up. Okay. So in order to ensure that you're not stuck here, we have two days. He's obviously a mad man, but any specific reason why he targeted you? Fear. He was afraid that I would expose him one day. And unless we put John Stone in the hell that he deserves, I'm going to be stuck in the in between forever. Expose him for what? Him and his wife took me in after my parents passed away. He abused me the first time when I was 14. And then he continued doing it until I was old enough to get out of the house. Did his wife know? If she did, she was too scared to say anything. I mean, being married to a pillar of the community is-- I, I got it. For now, I have to get going. You need to have a safe place to sleep tonight. Belvedere Cemetery. That's you, Mr. And Mrs. Olgivie. Nod off, Hero. Hi, Megan. You okay? Spider. We don't have all night. Get in the car, now. I think I'm gonna hurl. Deep breaths. Better? I can't believe this is happening right now. I have a little favor to ask. Thought you were gonna snooze through the rest of the night. You're here, my friend. Wait, I am? Where? Call it your jumping off place. Get in. Megan? Get in. How did you know where to find me? Seriously? You saw her too. It's nice. My brother's place. Mine is a horrible one bedroom. But he's out of town so I think we'll be safe here. When was the last time you ate something? I don't remember. Then I will make some eggs, after I make a drink. Do you want one? Huh? Oh, uh I don't drink. I can't, it's a neurological thing. Bathroom? If this is a miracle, it's one that nobody wants. And honestly, I think she's taken this blood sister thing just a little too far. But that's probably how she found you? Okay, and where is she now? Right here. Jesus Christ. Nope, still Taryn. You did it again. Should you call ahead? No, considering the circumstances, I think you're doing just fine. Is that my shirt? How many of those have you had? Enough to knock me on my ass. It just, I wish you would've told me about Stone. It was too dangerous. If you would've just looked at him the wrong way, he would've known that I told you. And why couldn't you have just left? It takes courage to leave. Courage, self-respect, everything that he stole from me. Now in two days I will be stuck in this shitty little town forever. We gotta bring Stone down and fast. Okay, so how? He has photos, Megan. And videos he took of us. Okay, even if we knew where to locate these tapes. He has a locked filing cabinet in his office at home. Do you know the combination? No, but you could get it off with a hammer and a chisel. In the garage. My brother has more tools than Chippendale's. Okay, that's after we break into the house. The Sheriff's house. He's lived alone since his wife died. And the house is empty during the day. He's never locked it, not even at night. So I just walk in? That's easy. Except for the fact that my face is gonna be plastered all over the news tomorrow morning. I've got it. You wear one of my brother's shirts, his tool belt. If anybody does see you, they're gonna think you're there doing a repair. I drive you up to the front of the house, you walk right in. It can't take what, a couple minutes? Okay, even if we get the videos, what then? Post them online. The local news station, the sheriff's department. I mean, YouTube, just get them out there. Taryn, what do you-- Is she coming back? What is that scent? Violets. I think it's what she leaves behind so that we can remember her, her soul. Hero? Yeah. Are you scared? Is there any other way to be? What, what if we screw this up tomorrow? I don't wanna think about that. Yeah, me either. What? You'll do. So what do you think happened last night? Looks like he knew we were coming. Yeah, somebody's giving him some help somewhere. Then there's probably another story. Take what, two weeks? It's negative on the prints from the knife. Too fragmentary. So what do you think? Do we go with person of interest or prime suspect? Well, tell me what we know about the kid. He's 28, multiple degrees in ancient history, archeology, paleontology. Research grants from different foundations, including the Smithsonian. Well that's nice, come on, Lara. Okay, no beefs. Not even an overdue parking ticket. Anybody that we've talked to so far speaks very highly of him. His temperament, diligence, social life. Parents are divorced, no siblings, but here's a recent photo pulled from the internet. You know, John, for me he just doesn't fit the profile. It takes a rare breed of killer to cut the throat like that and so far, no motive. So why's the kid on the run? Terrified, probably. Yeah well, if he happens to be innocent, maybe he'll come to his senses and turn himself in. Meanwhile, he's probably armed and I presume dangerous and that's what we're going with. That can get him shot. Yeah well, he's made that his problem, hasn't he? There it is. Yeah, and anybody could be watching through different directions. Walk right in through the front door, just like we talked about. Yeah, just walk right in. I will be right here when you come out, studying for my exam. Studying what? Tax accounting. I know, it's boring for someone who has been on expedition to Outer Mongolia. Yeah, subzero temperatures, dust storms, hostile locals. That was a cake walk compared to this. Hero. Yeah? Please get out of my car. We said no glasses. Repairmen don't wear glasses. And put your phone on silent. All right. Come on. Good, okay. Shh, shh, shh, shh, you'll wake Pauline. No. Got you, you son of a bitch. I thought I heard someone. Sorry, I-- It's quite all right. Did you find what you were looking for in John's office? Yes, ma'am. Sorry, didn't mean to disturb you. No bother, hardly a day goes by that John doesn't send one of his deputies around to retrieve something he forgot when he left for the office. I'm Mary Stone, John's mother. Which one are you? I'm Brian. Brian, you must be one of John's new deputies. Yes, ma'am. Second week on the job. Like I say, he's always in a hurry to be on his way in the morning. What was it today? Don't rightly know, Mrs. Stone. Just an envelope, don't know what's inside it. Speaking of which, I should probably-- Oh no, no. No rushing off. John will understand. I always make it a point to get to know all of John's deputies. May I take your arm, Deputy? We always take time in this house for tea and cookies. I've learned my way around this house very well since I came here. Almost two years now, but the stairs can be tricky for me. My mind wanders or forget how many steps there are. Did you tell me your last name? My short term memory's getting to be a problem, I'm afraid. It's Wakefield. Now the kitchen's around this way. Wakefield, Wakefield. Not the Wakefields that raise horses near Jasper. Shit. Sheriff. Hey, Megan. What are you doing here? I was on my way to Rick's place and it just died. Happened to just coast here, I guess. Well just pop the hood and I'll take a look, okay? Yeah, thank you. Okay, now try it. Sounds great. Well, Megan, if I were you, I'd go straight to Vinny's and get that battery checked. Yes, sir, will do. Thank you. My pleasure. The water's hot, if you wouldn't mind pouring for me. I love those homemade cookies that Ginger Wilson makes for me. But sometimes I have to hide them because John can go through a half a dozen with his bedtime glass of milk. You know Ginger, don't you? Of course I know Ginger. Mrs. Stone, I should-- It's a 357 Magnum. Please, stay seated whoever you are. Judge, how you doing? I may be blind, but I never miss a point blank range. I gotta call you back, Judge. Shit. Mother, for god's sake. Oh, John, I think he went out the way of the foyer. Put that thing down. I've told you and I've told you that the trigger pull on this piece is too long. Come on, come on, please, please. Shit. Where's Cruz? She's on her way. Should be here by now. Check around back, he's armed. I'm sure he's gone by now, but see what you can see. Gotcha. What the hell? Hero, thank God, I've been trying to get ahold of you. Hero, what happened to you? Hero, can you hear me? Hero? Here, let me give you a hand with that. Thank you. Hey, you've reached Megan. Leave a message and maybe I'll get back to you. Now what? Come on, she's needing you real bad. Where? Where it all began. Better grab ahold, son. Okay, that hurt. Taryn. I'm here. How do you do that? I can't. At least not without you. I, I don't understand. We've always been better together. The two of us. We're where it first began. Stone. No, it's deeper than that. I know you felt it, that connection to this place, to each other. The city. It is here, isn't it? Yes, where we first met. First fell in love. We've been doing this dance for a, a very long time. And hopefully we'll do it again. But right now, I need you to focus, Hero. I wish we had the luxury of time, but we don't. What do you need me to do. Open yourself to me. I need to use you as a conduit. Stop, stop, stop. It's like my head's on fire. You'll be fine. It's always difficult at first, but you'll get stronger. You have to get stronger. Wait, no, Taryn. I've got the disk. I saw what that bastard did. We've got him. And hopefully it's enough. But I can't risk that, we can't. If it comes to it, you have to show everyone. Taryn, I have no idea what I'm doing. Can't you just-- I don't know if I'm gonna have any energy left. Focus on the truth, Hero. I need to go rest up for the big day. You can rely on Jacob. How am I supposed to find a ghost. He'll know when you need him. Jacob's not a ghost, he's an angel. Terrific. Hero. Her-- Oh, thank God. Hero, I got food. Hero. Hero? Shh, shh, shh, shh, you'll wake Pauline. No. That wasn't so bad, was it? No, no. Where is he, Megan? Where is he? Listen, there's always a little blood in the beginning. A little pain. It'll get better. That's all right, baby. I'm fine to myself. Thou shalt not kill, John. Jesus. John. Oh, thank God. Megan? Oh God. Megan. Megan. Megan. How's she doing? She'll make it, but I've got some airway concerns. Whoever it was, was one strong dude. Is she gonna die? All I can tell you, is her spirit ain't left her body. This is all my fault. What am I gonna do now? In a couple hours Taryn's body's gonna be buried and her spirit's gonna be stuck here, maybe for eternity. Whoa, whoa wait. This ain't no time to be crying the blues. Now you know what's got to be done. Bad odds, they'll shoot me down in the street. Now listen, the Lord looks with favor on the righteous, son. Get this to the lab. Yeah, you got it. What the hell happened here? Whoever he was, he was in a hurry. Some more blood splattered over here, but it's not as if he cut an artery. Why don't you go ahead and track it. I'll see how far it goes. Now, slay all the whores of Babylon. For they stand between the just and the righteous in the throne of heaven. John, it's late. You should be in bed. I've always, always done the Lord's will. Obeyed His judgments. Even when they confused me, mother. I know. And I've dedicated my life, my life mother, to the destruction of the kingdom of evil wherever I find it on this earth. I know. I have licked the wine of her fornications from my fingertips. And yet, she is not dead. John, please. You're overtired. Come to bed. She is not dead. And still, she stands between all of us at the throne of heaven. And God, God torments me in His silence. What, what do I do now? What? Pray, John. Yes. Yes. She gonna make it? He almost crushed her windpipe. I overheard the nurses talking. She'll pull through. If I had been there-- You'd both be dead. Don't underestimate him. He's quick and he's strong. Promise me you'll take care of her. You need to get going, now. Now. What are you doing here? It's after hours. I know, I'm sorry. I was just leaving. You need to stay right here. Security. Security. Hey, you. Hi, can you tell me what room Megan Holloway's at. 512. Security, 1033 on the fifth floor. Security-- - Where are the stairs? Intruder on the fifth floor. Have security meet me on the fifth floor. Come on, come on. Not this way, get to the roof. Why? Just go. I'll explain everything on the way. Deputy Sheriff, stop. No. No. Take it easy, now. You don't wanna be up there. I didn't do anything, he set me up. Okay, let's talk about that. You come any closer, I jump. Okay, easy. Hero, right? I'm Lara. I didn't kill Taryn. I didn't hurt Megan either. Please, you have to stop him. Who is he? You won't believe me. I believe you. And we need to find out what happened. You and me. I'm not falling for that. Open your eyes before it's too late. No, shit. What kept you?

But John and his dearly departed wife, Pauline, took her in, gave her a home, and raised her as their very own. So John, would you like to come up and say a few words for us, please? Thank you. And thank you, Miranda for... I know that the song that you chose was one of Taryn's favorites because I would hear her at night at home in her room alone singing it over and over to the music. And yes, the And yes, the (coughing), words were especially meaningful... It's all right, John. It's all right. Must be the flowers. I'm afraid that I didn't see Taryn as much as I would have liked around here. But I know and believe that Jesus lived always in her heart. So I know we will all excuse her for the anger and confusion she was feeling. Now, I would like to invite you all to follow the procession to the grave site service. No baby, your sister did not see me on Friday night. Okay Taryn, do your stuff. - No, I was goin-- - That's tellin' her. Boo. Sorry. Get out of the car. Stop. Hey, come on. What should I do? Just, just follow that hearse. John, what is it, what's wrong? I don't know, momma. Lara. This is Cruz, go ahead. Someone hijacked the hearse from the funeral. They're southbound on 68 near Beaver Falls. Copy that, we're in route. Hit the lights. Pull over now and stop the vehicle. Don't lose him, don't lose him. Over there. Get over to the side of the road. Pull over. Pull over, now. Get out of the hearse, show me your hands. Stay here. Stand down, stand down. Is everybody here? Get out, slow. You're in a world of trouble, son. What you're gonna slaughter me too? She was punished according to her sin. No, I saw you. I felt what you did to her. Any evil you saw in her was just a reflection of you. You can't prove a thing. I'm not the one who's going to. Mommy look. We didn't do anything. Liar. Oh my lord, what is happening? You, you're doing this. What have you done? What's wrong with you? But she had to die. Don't you understand? Tammy, Sandy, you know what I'm saying is true. It's there, in the Bible. Revelations, Mark. Amber. Heed the word, listen to me, people. Listen to me. Don't do it, John. Let Hero go. Haven't I always done what I felt was necessary to keep the evil from this earth. To keep the evil from darkening the sky, like it's darkening our soul. The evil that's in that young whore, fawning. Stop, that's blasphemy. Drop the knife, Sheriff. No, remember, remember the prophesy in Revelation. Come out of her, people, lest you be part of her sin. Lest you share in her plague. John? Mother. Whatever you have done, John, there is forgiveness for all sins. Please don't hurt me anymore. Only one way to salvation. What is that way, John? It's, it's, it's blood. Mother. Shed blood. - Oh John. - No, no. Hero. So, it worked? You're getting stronger. You came to me. And are you? Good, for the first time in a while. Good. Find me a little sooner next time? You always find me first. Thank you, Hero, for everything. Whatcha thinking about? These were left here this morning. They look fresh. All I know is they weren't here last night. Then you think it's her way of telling us? Wherever she is, she made it. Well I guess we got a lot of work to do, huh? How do you figure? The lost city. You're the most famous guy in Carver County right now. I mean, just wait 'til this hits the internet. I figure we buy two shovels and start digging. Shovels? Do you realize how expensive an archeological dig is? No idea.
