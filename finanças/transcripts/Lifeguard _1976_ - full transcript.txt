How about a ring back? (TELEPHONE RINGING) Right. Perfect. Up yours, too. See you later. -Rick Carlson? -Yeah. I'm Chris Randall. Supposed to be helping you out on weekends? Yeah, come on up. RICK: The important thing is, man, to spot trouble before it happens. Watch the people when they go in the water. See what kind of swimmers they are. See how they treat the ocean. You know, are they confident? Are they scared? And keep a special eye on the little kids. Man, they can get knocked down in a second. Now, if you're alone, if you have to leave the tower... take the phone off the hook and they'll send a back-up man. Keep the rescue can with you always. Even if you're just going to the john. You can never tell when you're gonna need it. Keep your eye out for any weird stuff happening on the beach... or up in the parking lot. -Like what? -Anything. All the weirdoes seem to end up down here. Man, you're gonna see stuff you're not gonna believe. The funny thing is... by the end of the summer, it'll all seem normal. Hey, guys, that's it. Out of the water. Black ball. Thanks a lot, man. It hasn't even gotten good yet. Man, you guys know the rules. On weekends, swimmers beach after 10:00. Yeah, thanks a lot. Hey, Lifeguard Rick! Hey, what's happening, Machine Gun? Hey, old buddy, you ready for another thrill-packed summer? Not if you guys have anything to do with it. Okay. Just for that we're moving down to tower seven. That a promise? Hey, listen, this place would be a drag without the UDT. These guys get their kicks out of feeling up the local ladies underwater. Underwater Demolition Team. Try going straight this summer and just concentrate on getting laid. All the chicks our age, they dig older guys. And all the chicks younger than us, they aren't even chicks yet. One of these days, you're gonna get your asses kicked by somebody's old man. No chance. We've been working on our technique all year. This summer's gonna be different. I promise. Cross my heart. Better cross something else while you're at it. Those are the horniest little guys this side of TJ. -TJ? -Tijuana, man. (LAUGHS) Why do they call him Machine Gun? I don't know. Everybody calls him that. He claims he holds the international record for jerking off. When I was his age, I thought I held it. Yeah, we all held it. But I think he holds it more. (LAUGHS) -What do you do during winter? -Same thing I do during summer. -Yeah? Must get Ionely, huh? -Beats selling encyclopedias. Yeah, that's for sure. You want to stop for a beer? I'd like to, but I got a little stewy friend coming in tonight. Is it true what they say about stewardesses? Yeah. And nurses, secretaries and schoolteachers. (LAUGHS) What do they say about schoolteachers? They make you do it over and over again, till you get it right. -(LAUGHS) Okay. -See you tomorrow. -All right. -Good night. (WHISPERS) I'll be damned. -(KNOCKING ON DOOR) -Shit. Yeah, be right there. -(KNOCKING ON DOOR) -Yeah, I'm coming. -Hi. -Hi. It's only a 12-hour layover so you're gonna have to work fast. -Miss me? -Sure did. I'll bet you did. A little vino. Gonna crack it open. Still haven't gotten any plants in here, have you? Yeah, right around the corner. Careful, it's a man-eater. -Plastic. That's obscene. -It saves on the watering. Too much responsibility for you? You just got to work up to some things gradually. Only some things. I've been on a plane for about two weeks, it seems like. -I'm gonna take a shower. -Okay. (WATER SPLASHING) (LAUGHS) Oh! TINA: It's cold! You! (GRUNTS) (GIGGLES) I met a man on the flight to London who wants me to go to Marrakesh with him. Marrakesh? -Well, are you gonna go? -I don't know. He's attractive. And wealthy. -And he's better in bed than you are. -Nobody's better in bed than I am. (LAUGHS) I know. That's your problem. That's my problem too, though. But I know your secret. What's that? You don't care. -What are you talking about? -You. You're great technically, but you don't feel anything. I really didn't go to bed with him. Who? The man who wants me to go to Marrakesh. -I don't think I'll go. -You ought to. Why, you'd have it made if you hooked up with one of those rich guys. I know. My problem is I don't think I can do it. I mean, I'd have to love him, too. Your problem is you want everything. All I want is someone to love who'll love me. Your problem is you want everything. Do you have a Band-Aid? Yeah, sure. Come on up. Dunk your feet in that bucket. -How'd you do that? -On a root beer can. Probably gonna have to amputate. Not that bad, is it? There you go. -Thank you. -You're welcome. (SCREAMING) Yoo-hoo! -Do you know what time it is? -Yeah, sure. (WAVES CRASHING) -4:15. Give or take a few. -That's pretty good. (LAUGHS) Old Boy Scout trick. Never fails. Are you an old Boy Scout? Yup. And I still remember the tricks. (BIRDS CHIRPING) (BARKING) (BARKS) PHOTOGRAPHER: Okay, honey, give me that big cheese number. Go all the way in. Get yourself wet. Marvelous. Let's go into that one-two-three routine. This is gonna be good watchin'. RICK: Look at that set of melons. You're beautiful. There they go. Lookit. (LAUGHS) Whoo! Oh, my God! Look out! GIRL: Oh, my God! (LAUGHS) (PHOTOGRAPHER YELLING) (LAUGHS) BOYS: Whoo! BOYS: Go! Go! Get a move on! -Can't those guys get arrested for that? -You kidding? Remember coming down here when you were 14? See a girl in a two-piece suit, you'd have a hard-on for a week. Yeah, I remember. RICK: Hi. How's the injury? (BIRDS CHIRPING) -It's all better. -Looks good. No scar. Thought I'd let you know about it in case you were worried. Oh, yeah? Matter of fact I was just saying to Chris... "All week long, I've been wondering if that little girl's finger's all right." -Right, Chris? -Yeah, right. Little girl? What are you? -Just a girl. -Oh, just a girl. Well, you're just an old Boy Scout. (RICK LAUGHS) Keep you eyes on the swimmers, rookie. Enjoy being a little girl. You're gonna be a woman soon enough. Thanks a lot. Getting there is half the fun. -I guess you ought to know. -I guess so. Well... See you. Be careful. Boy, she's some stuff, huh? -I'd like to run into her in a couple of years. -I'd like to run into her right now. -She can't be more than 15 or 16. -So? They don't call it statutory rape anymore, but they'll still throw your ass in jail. -What do they call it now? -IIlegal sex. (GIGGLES) Boy, I think it'd be worth the risk. Not for 10 years in the can. That's rule number one. (MUSIC PLAYING) (ALL CHATTERING) Anybody sitting here? Coors, please. Hi. Aren't you a lifeguard down at the beach? Yeah. You look really familiar. Have you saved anyone lately? Yeah, matter of fact, I was three for five today. (LAUGHS) What happened to the other two? They were just too far out. Had to let them go. -Three for five's not bad, though. -Isn't it? -Come on, you're kidding me, aren't you? -No. Actually, I haven't spent much time at the beach lately... -since I've been working. -Oh, yeah? -What do you do? -I work for a doctor in Century City. -Are you a nurse? -No, a receptionist. -What kind of doctor? -Gynecologist. (LAUGHS) I hear there's a lot of openings in that field. No, actually, it took me a long time to find. -Then things must be pretty tight. -Yeah, they really are. -Hey, my name's Sandy. -I'm Rick. Can I buy you a drink? -(BOTH LAUGH) -Sure. That old guy never stops. He must be at least 70. (GIRL SCREAMS) Look at that old gal. The water's not even up to her boobs and she thinks she's drowning. -Better go in and get her. -Me? -You're a lifeguard, aren't you? Go on. -Yeah. (SIGHS) (GIRL SCREAMING) (BEEPING) -Where you going to school? -Santa Barbara. Like it? -A necessary evil, I guess. -Yeah, I know what you mean. Tried it once. Got a degree, too. B.S. Bored Shitless. (LAUGHS) I'll be damned. -Hold the fort, will you? -Sure. Hey, Larry! -Rick? -Yep. -I'll be right with you. -What's happening? -Rick Carlson. How the hell are you? -Good to see you. -All right. How you doing? -Fine. -You look good. -You, too. It's got to be 10 years, right? Why, yeah, at least. How's the acting career? Gave that up five years ago, told my agent to shove it. What are you doing? You are looking at the man... that owns the largest Porsche agency in the Valley. -It is a basic gold mine. -You got to be kidding. I want to show you something. -How in the hell did you swing that? -Just charm. Plus, my partner does have a lot of money. Now the truth comes out. There. Where is it? There. -Too much. -Isn't it something? -I'm really happy for you. -You know something? In five years, I'll have made my first million. Not bad for a kid who was voted class clown, huh? Really. -Plus, we do have a few fringe benefits. -I noticed. Hi, ladies. You gonna be at the class reunion? Man, I don't think so. It'll probably be a big drag. Hey, I understand that Cathy split from her old man. Oh, yeah? That's too bad. She'll probably be there. Maybe you two can kind of rekindle the old... -So you ended up selling cars? -Not cars, Porsches. The finest machine on the road today. Porsches. Hey, you know something? You know, I think we could use a guy like you. We've got a very groovy, hang-Ioose kind of operation. I think you'd love it. -Me? -Yeah, you. With your personality, I'll bet you'd earn $20,000 the first year. $20,000? -Will you think about it? -Yeah. Okay, you got my card. Give it some thought. Now, come on, I want you to meet a customer and her friend. All right. (HELICOPTER WHIRRING) Hey, some big guys are beating up on Machine Gun. Okay, I'm right there. You got to stop it. He's gonna get hurt. I told you I don't got any, now cut it out! I'll bet you got it hid. Come on. -Now, you're gonna get it. -Knock it off. You better get back to your tower, lifeguard. Any more rough stuff and I'll call the cops. Okay, back off, asshole! -(GRUNTS) -Come on, man, come on! -(WAVES CRASHING) -You all right? (EXHALES) Yeah, I think so. Machine Gun, you want me to call the cops? No, it'll just cause more trouble. Get the hell off the beach and don't come back! -Sure you're all right? -Yeah. All right, go on home. I'll see you later. I thought I told you to always take this thing with you. Yeah, I forgot. Next time you better remember it. It can save you a hell of a lot more than lives sometimes. I love to throw bastards like that off my beach. Get him lying down. Get a resuscitator! (GIRLS SHOUTING) (BIRDS CHIRPING) (WHISTLING) Come on in! Come on! It's great! What are you doing down here? It's a lousy day. I didn't have anything better to do. Come on! -Where are your friends? -Don't have any. What do you mean you don't have any? We just moved here from San Diego. -Oh, yeah? How do you like LA? -Hate it! The girls are snotty and the boys are a bunch of creeps. At least the ones I've met anyway. Come on! Get wet, you big chicken! (LAUGHS) Okay, huh! (LAUGHS) Ok, I quit. -Why'd you leave San Diego? -My dad got a better job. Good reason. Sure, for him. It just ruins my life. Oh, yeah? You'll make some friends. Hey, you have a towel? -I forgot it. -(LAUGHS) Come on, I'll get you one. -You going to school? -One more year till I get out. -Going to college? -Nope, don't think so. I'd like to travel. Maybe go to Europe. Find yourself a rich husband? No, I'm not interested in marriage. Like to live with someone, though. Like to see what that's like. -Do you live with anyone? -No, not right now. -But have you? -Yeah, a few times. What does that mean? (LAUGHS) Well, when it's good, it's pretty good. When it's bad, it's bad. Look at all the divorces. -Your folks still together? -Yes. -They love each other? -(EXHALES) I don't know. -I guess not. -See what I mean? You take all the people that are divorced... and all those that should be divorced, who you got left? I'm sure there're some people somewhere. I'm sure. Ozzie and Harriet. Have you made love with many girls? What, are you writing a book? No. Just curious. -Have you? -Yeah, a few. -Have you made love with many boys? -Just once. I didn't really like it, though. We didn't really know what we were doing. You got lots of time. A woman doesn't hit her prime till she's 30. Yeah, by then I want to be really good at it. It's a great ambition. -I want to make love with you. -What? I want to make love with you. I've thought about it ever since you bandaged my finger. Why don't you wait awhile? At least till you're 16. I'm 17. You got a deadline? Don't you want to? Yeah. Find somebody closer to your own age. Someone you really like. I really like you. What's your name? Wendy. What's yours? Rick.

The pitch. Strike three. Garvey's out, and Bill Buckner at the plate. Fourth inning. Dodgers leading one-to-nothing. -Hey, Ricky! Good to see you. (LAUGHS) -Hi, Dad. Good to see you. Hey, Mother! Ricky's here! -How are you doing? -Pretty good. -Who's winning the game? -I don't know. I dozed off. The Dodgers, I think. -How you doing? -Good to see you. Good to see you. -I got a good dinner for you. -Great. What are we having? -Lamb stew, okay? -Perfect. -It'll be ready in just a minute. -Okay. -How's things at the beach? -Crazy as ever. Saved anyone lately? Yeah, I was three for five today. That's better than Garvey's doing. It's a lousy game. -Win some, lose some. -Yeah. Hey, I heard a great one at work today. What do you do with an elephant with three balls? (LAUGHS) I don't know. (BOTH LAUGH) You walk him and pitch to the giraffe. (BOTH LAUGHING) Heard anything from Chet? He called last week. He's fine. He's working up at school, doing some kind of research. -Says he's working real hard. -RICK: Good. One more year and he starts raking it in. Says he'll have no problem starting somewhere around $1,500 a month. RICK: Man! Kid brother makes good. -Money isn't everything. -It's most things, believe me. Don't ever put down financial security. I know what money can do. Without it, you're lost, dead. You know, that stew was an old recipe of Grandma's. I'm doing okay. -You putting any away? -A little. You better start now. Things aren't getting any easier. Everyone's sweating these days. I put in 23 years in the same place... and now I've got to worry about being cut back. The damnedest thing of all is if I get canned... I stand to lose my pension. Twenty-three years down the drain! It's no goddamn fair. Who said the world's gotta be fair? Anybody like some ice cream on their pie? You're not a kid at the beach anymore. -Well, I'm doing what I want to do. -Father? A little dab'll do you. That's the problem right there, no discipline. You know, it's crazy... I still wonder what you're gonna be when you grow up. (BIRDS CHIRPING) -Hi. -Hi. -What are you doing out here? -I spent the night here. -Crazy? -Why? Know how many people have been raped and killed on these damn beaches at night? Oh, it was beautiful! I saw the sun come up. -Do your parents know you're here? -No. Don't you think maybe they'll be worried? Don't care. We had a fight. And I had to get out. They've probably got the cops out looking for you. They probably don't even know I'm gone. Look, I've got to open up. -Why don't you go give them a call? -Okay. I'll split. I wouldn't want to get you in trouble. You're the one who's gonna be in trouble if you don't give them a call. -What's this? -WENDY: Oh, it's for you. -Something to cheer up the tower. -Thanks. Don't worry. We could pretend we don't know each other. (LAUGHS) My God! Oh, my God! MOTHER: Oh, my god! (MOTHER SCREAMS) Oh, my God! Help! Somebody help those kids! Help! Oh, my little boy! It's my little girl! (SIREN WAILING) He's got Marie. (MOTHER CRYING) I told you not to go in, didn't I? Didn't I tell you not to go in? Marvin, you were so brave! My God!

Of course I'm Ionely at sea. Get planked at sea, then you're alone... Lifeguard! There's a man over there being obscene. -He's showing his privates. -Where is he? Well, he was right over there but... There he is. Want to file a police complaint? -I don't want to do that, do you? -No, just make him stop. For God's sake, there's kids around. Okay, we'll take care of it. Thank you. -Hey, Chris. -CHRIS: Yeah? See that guy in the blue over there? -The old guy? -Yeah. Two ladies complained he was wagging his weenie at them. -That guy? -Yeah. Tell him if he doesn't keep it zipped, we're gonna call the cops. Okay. -Be courteous, but don't take any crap. -Sure. CHRIS: Sir! Sir! I couldn't do it. -What do you mean, you couldn't do it? -I couldn't do it. Why? -He looks just like my father. -(LAUGHS) Oh, shit. Here. (LAUGHS) (KNOCKING AT DOOR) Trick or treat? I don't believe it. How'd you find out where I live? I did what any respectable girl would do. Followed you home one night. You're nuts! -Can I come in? -Yeah, sure come on in. I thought you'd be happy to see me. I am. It's just that I'm getting ready to go out. -You want me to leave? -No, it's all right. Sit down. I'll be right out. I just wanted to see you and talk to you. I like talking to you. You have your high-school reunion tonight? Yeah. It'll happen to you someday. Fifteen years! -That means you're over 30. -That's right. -I didn't think you were that old. -What do you mean "that old"? Nothing, I mean, I thought you were in your 20s. -Big generation gap, huh? -Nope. -You're scared of me, aren't you? -No. Yes, you are. So are my parents. -Did you know I'm straight A's? -No, I didn't. But I'm impressed. They're scared I'll do something crazy. Run away, or use drugs. Ruin my brain. You're scared I'll make trouble for you. I won't. Okay. Another. Come on, I'll walk you out. -Some other time, okay? -Yeah. Some other time. (MUSIC PLAYING) (ALL CHATTERING) Good to see you. Bye. Ricky Carlson. Norma Sommers. I used to be a blonde. -Nice to see you. -How you doing, Ricky? -Bill Winkler. Remember me? -Good to see you. How you doing? -Okay. -Let me pin you up. You haven't changed one bit. Yeah, I bet you're saying that to everybody. -Thanks. See you later. -Have fun. All right. Hey, Rick, old buddy. -Still driving that 5300? -Yeah.

(PEOPLE CHATTERING) -LARRY: Rick. -Hey, Larry. -How you doing? -Good. Man, were you right. Can you believe this crew? Man, I told you. You were supposed to call me. What happened? Fringe benefits in my business, too. I was serious. I even told my partner about it. -He wants to speak to you. -Tell him to come down to the beach. I just ran into Cathy back there. I mean she is really looking good. I bet. Between you and I... did you two ever really get it on together? No. I knew it. You used to go around telling everybody you did, right? We all said a lot of things. Most of it was always bullshit. Well, I hate to drink and run, but I'm gonna split from here. -Will you think about that $20,000? -Yeah. -Save yourself, lifeguard, will you? -All right. Good photo. Pete says you're the one who corrupted him. It was the other way around. He used to take me... to Tijuana every other weekend. -That's not the way I heard it. -Well, that's the way it was. We'd get a little bombed on tequila and he'd spend the day... chasing all the whores around waving a $5 bill. That's not the way you tell it. -Thanks, pal. -Just wanted to keep the record straight. Did he tell you about the chick with the donkey? A donkey? Oh that's sick. That's really sick. A donkey, a poor little animal, defenseless... (ALL CHATTERING) Hey, Rick. -Hi, man, how are you? -Fine. -Good to see you. -Fine. You remember Janet Murphy? Yeah. She had the biggest tits in junior high and high school. Right. Well, she's sitting over there, take a look at her now, in the green dress. -Holy shit! -Hey, we gotta have lunch sometime. -Yeah, sure. -What are you into now? Wait, let me guess. -Let's see, you're in insurance, right? -Nope, I'm... Wait a minute. Outdoors, constructionist, huh? -Still down at the beach. -Lifeguard? That's right. No kidding. That's great. (SIGHS) God damn, Rick, when I think how I used to fantasize about Janet Murphy... CLASS PRESIDENT: We have several awards to hand out during the evening. I have an award to give here. The award to the guy and gal... who've changed the least in the past 15 years. It goes to Woody Oberman and Peggy Snider. Come on, let's hear it for Woody and Peggy. -What have you been up to, Rick? -I'm still down at the... Well, actually I'm moving over into sales. Automobiles. -Far out, man. -Yeah. And now, the Pride of the Class Award... goes to the assemblyman from our own district... our own Walt Valentinei (CROWD APPLAUDING) (WOMAN CHATTERING) Maybe we could get together for lunch next week. JUDY: Yeah. That'll be nice. Why don't you bring your little boy and I'll bring my three. -Okay. -We can have a mob scene. You can come by the gallery and then we can... I'd like to see it. -Then we can go to lunch. -Okay, that'll be fine. I'll give you a call. I'd like to meet your little boy. EXbrook 34482? Hi. (EXCLAIMS) That's incredible. My mother still has that number. (CHUCKLES) -You remember Judy. -Sure. Hi, Judy. Hi, Ricky. Frank and I ran into Ricky in Hawaii at the... What's the name of that hotel where you won the surfing championship? Oh, yeah, sure. Can you join us? Thank you. -You still surf, Ricky? -No. Never. -You certainly look as if you could. -Thanks. Great tan. -Do you work outdoors? -Yeah. Yeah, I work for the county. Really? That must be interesting work. Imagine remembering that number after 15 years. I call my mom every week and I have trouble remembering it. Well, I better find Frank before he passes out. He's always lecturing his patients on the abuses of alcohol. But I wouldn't want to light a match near him tonight. I'll call you, Cathy. Yeah, listen, the first one is home and the second one's the gallery. But don't call me at home during the day. All you'll get is, "No en casa." -Okay. Bye-bye. -Bye-bye. -Bye-bye, Ricky. -Bye, Judy. Nice to see you. (CROWD CLAPPING) What gallery? It's on La Cienega. I got a job after my divorce. Now I run an art gallery. -(LAUGHS) -That's great. Well (LAUGHING). The mustache really threw me. I like it. Thanks. Somehow, I thought you wouldn't show up. I almost didn't. Just too many people asking too many questions. Wild man Ricky Carlson. The living legend. Something like that. (CHUCKLES) Oh, the hell with them. -Been saying that all night. -Listen, you rat. I've never forgiven you for not taking me to grad night. I thought that was the way you wanted it. No, really. (CHUCKLES) You just maneuvered it so that you could take... that sexpot, Sally what's-her-name. Oh, yeah. She was pretty sexy at that, wasn't she? And I wasn't, right? Well, you were a nice girl. That's a different kind of sexy. Hey, Coltonon and Carlson. The class couple. This is just like old times. Hey, remember me? -Yeah, man. -Hi. -Cathy, you remember... -You bet. Hi, Cathy. Boy. Did you two tie the old knot? No, we're still going steady, man. This is really... We are all together here. I think it's... Going steady? (PEOPLE CHATTERING) (MUSIC PLAYING) (CLEARS THROAT) Very nice. CATHY: Come on. I want you to see someone. And this is David. RICK: Cute little guy. It takes some getting used to. You with a kid. Damn. I haven't spilled anything in years. (SIGHS) Will you stay tonight? I really want to. But? I don't know. It seems strange. Why? Because I'm still a nice girl? No. Because you're you. It just feels wrong. Being with you just once. Okay? Okay. Can you come to dinner tomorrow night? (BOTH CHUCKLING) -(CROWD ROARING, MAN WHISTLING) -Thank you for being here. They're moving into the surf line, the final leg of the dory competition. In orange helmets we have the County. In red and gold, State Southern, white and blue stripe, City.

You sure you want to swim anchor? -(MAN CHATTERING) -You got any better ideas? Chris swims for the team up at Santa Barbara. -You never told me that. -You didn't ask me. So what? You should've told me. I figured you wanted to be anchor. (WHISTLE BLOWS) Okay, men, it'll be Bobby, Kenny. Me and Chris'll be anchor. ANNOUNCER: Okay, run-swim-run competitors. Line it up. Let's go.

The start of this event will be, "Swimmers, to your marks," and the gun. Everybody ready? Swimmers, to your marks. -(GUN FIRES) -They're off! In the green caps, we have South Bay. In light blue, State Central. In the red, State Southern. In gold, we have County. Black and white caps, City. State Northern in dark blue. Into the water, in the first leg of the four-man relay. Exciting race, ladies and gentlemen, very grueling. County needs to win this one -(CROWD ROARING) -to retain the championship. They are a mere four points ahead of the other teams. They're on their way into the surf line, now. It looks like County is in first place in the gold caps. They're followed by State Central in light blue. And State Northern in the dark blue caps, racing their way up the beach now. Here they come. Give them a nice round of applause... as they exchange here and start into lap two. County in first place. State Central in second place. -State Northern in third place. -Go on! County must win this to retain their championship. Very important race for them. (ALL CHEERING) Come on, Kenny! ALL: Come on! ...and battle with each other towards the beach. Hoping for a wave. Here they come. It's still County in first place in the gold caps. It's State Central in the light blue caps. Immediately behind them, it's State Northern in dark blue. Here they come, running up that beach, ladies and gentlemen. Come on! They're making the exchange, here. (ALL CHEERING) MAN: Come on! (ALL SCREAMING) Looks like County's dropping back. Being overtaken by the State Central team in light blue... and the South Bay team in the green caps. Dropping back. It's a rugged race, ladies and gentlemen. At the buoy, it's South Bay in green, State Central in light blue... State Southern is moving towards the third spot. In fourth spot we have the County in gold. The race is far from over. Anything can happen at the surf line. Third lap. Swimmers are picking the man to beat. South Bay in the green has now taken over first place. Come on! Go on! (CROWD CHEERING) They'll make an exchange. Anchor lap, coming up. Don't go away, ladies and gentlemen. (PANTING) -(CROWD CHEERING) -Central now, State Southern now. Here comes the County for their exchange. Into the water. South Bay is still in first place. State Central in the second. State Southern in the red caps, third. County in fourth. Off to the buoy. It's a four-man race, still. (ANNOUNCER CHATTERING) County is moving to third place, back in the thick of the race. (RETCHES) All swimmers are on their feet now for the run to the beach. Here they come! It's South Bay in first place. It's State Southern in second place. County in third place, making a move for second. It's South Bay, State Southern, County. South Bay, County, State Southern... in that order, ladies and gentlemen. What an exciting finishi We came in second. Chris pulled it out for us. Yeah, great. -(PEOPLE WHISTLING) -Congratulations. -(GASPING) -Are you okay? (PANTING) Yeah, I just swallowed some water. I think I can get out tonight. I can tell my parents I'm baby-sitting. Swimmers, gather around the announcer's stand for the presentation of awards. (GASPING) Aren't you in enough trouble with them? Hey, Rick. They're giving out the awards. Yeah, okay. -Nice going. -Thanks. You're breaking your rules a bit, aren't you, Lifeguard Rick? Maybe bending it a little bit. The shape he's in, about all he can handle is just a little. -You goddamn... -Come on, get off. Okay. Man, you've really got a problem. It was just a joke. Jesus. I'm sorry, man. Now, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to present to you... the Chairman of the Surf Festival... and Captain of the County Lifeguards, Jim Anderson. Keep your arms down. Attaboy, kick them hard. That's right. Pretty good. Look, there's Mom. Let's go see her. Here, get on, chief. We're coming. Where's our lunch? CATHY: Where are you in this book? Look what I found. Funny. Real funny. (CATHY LAUGHING) David, let me show you a picture of Mommy. David, look at Mommy upside down. -(RICK LAUGHING) -It can't be as bad as yours. Look at this. JV rally. -No picture could beat yours. -Junior Varsity, 1960. Let's see that. In the next page is a picture of old sexpot Sally what's-her-name. Where? -She looks kind of fat, don't you think? -Don't look too fat to me. -How's it look? -CATHY: Open your mouth. (CATHY LAUGHING) (MUSIC PLAYING) Will you put that book away? Is he asleep? He will be. He's exhausted. He loved having a man around. Look at this. Look at old Morgan. He was such a weird guy. Was he at the reunion? No, he's dead. Suicide. Wow. Things change. Do you like that kind of music? I can put something else on. No, it's fine. It's nice. I sold a painting today. An Eilshemius. It was a special favorite of mine. I almost cried when the customer took it away. Eilshemius was a funny old man. Insane, I guess, but... RICK: Yeah, I like the winter, too. It gets so quiet out there. Sometimes, I feel like I'm the last man on earth. CATHY: Lonely, huh? (RICK LAUGHS) It sure is peaceful. Got a lot more time to think in the winter. You can really get into that ocean. Even the fog... gets so thick sometimes, you can't even see the water. Funny thing is you just keep on looking. Even when you can't see anything. Summer's fun. A lot of action, fun in the sun. But I like the winters more. How many winters? Six? Eight. Long time. Yeah. (SIGHS) So what's next for you? Do you move up? Or out? Out, I guess. To what? Maybe selling Porsches. -CATHY: Sounds good. -RICK: Yeah. (ENGINE REVVING) -JACK: Did you say lifeguard? -RICK: That's right. What makes you think you can be a salesman? (SNICKERS) I know a lot of good jokes, and I can hold my booze. I repeat my question. What makes you think you can be a salesman? Mr. Gilmore, in my business, I deal with people and problems. -It's nothing different... -We don't deal with problems. We deal with money. We don't care about suntans or muscles. We care about sales. That's not the beach out there, it's the marketplace. Those guys aren't solving problems... they're selling. Mr. Gilmore, you got it all wrong. That blond, Adonis image you're talking about... that doesn't fit anymore. There's a lot of training involved, responsibility and a lot of discipline. I do more P.R. work out on that beach in a summer day... than you do in here in a month. But you're right. Saving lives isn't selling cars. Now, wait. Wait, wait. That's pretty good. I like that. But if being a lifeguard is so great, why are you here? -Larry told me I could double my money. -Fine. Before I spend a dime to train you... I want it in blood that you're gonna stick with it. No drifting back to the beach the first day you resent wearing a shirt. -Mr. Gilmore, I came here because... -WOMAN: Mr. Gilmore, private line. I'll be back. Why don't you take a look and I'll be right back, okay? How's it going? -It's going. -Good. Hell of a personality. Forget it. He's just giving you his old treatment. Don't worry about it. -Can you smell the money in this place? -Yeah. -All right? -Yeah. I gotta get back to my customer. -Now just stay easy, hang loose. -Okay. (CAWING) (CHILDREN SHOUTING) (WAVES CRASHING) (CHILDREN CHATTERING) (GIRL LAUGHING) Hi. Hi. Haven't seen you for a while. Couldn't get out of the house for two weeks. -Bad scene? -Bad scene. Sorry to hear that. -Finally realized my parents are insane. -Most parents are. I thought about you a lot. -Thought about you, too. -Really? When are we gonna make love again? I don't know if it's a good idea, Wendy. Why? 'Cause both of us could get into a lot of trouble. Because I'm jailbait? You are underage. It is against the law. -It's a stupid law. -Yeah? I could still lose my job. You wouldn't want that to happen, would you? No one has to know. It's just too dangerous. In a lot of ways. -Then you don't want to see me again? -I didn't say that. I just think it'd be better if you found someone else closer to your own age. But I want you. Okay, then I have to find someone closer to my age. Probably already have. Have you? Sort of. Then you don't want to make love with me anymore. It's the best thing. For both of us. Try and understand that. I am. But I can't. Hey. Come on. (KNOCK ON DOOR) Hi. Is señora en casa? -CATHY: Rick? -Yeah! I'm in the kitchen. -Thank you. -CATHY: Gracias, Amalia. -Hi. -Hi there. -I thought you'd have her doing this. -She's great, but Mexican dishes only. -Hi, David. -DAVID: Hi. Well, I got the job. Fantastic! I got some champagne in the refrigerator. Let me finish and we'll celebrate. I got the offer. I'm not sure I'm gonna take it. Why? It sounds like a great opportunity. Let me, Mommy. All right, let's see. Here. Here's a bowl, and here's some spoons. You pretend you're cooking, okay? We have something to celebrate. I told them I wanted to think it over. -Why? -I don't know, I just... You're not gonna stay at the beach the rest of your life, are you? No. You know, I meet lots of rich people at the gallery. I could steer them your way. -You'd sell loads of Porsches. -I'm finished, Mommy. Honey, why don't you go in and play with Amalia now, okay? Mommy's busy, come on. (SIGHS) Rick, you've always been able to make people like you. You'll be very good at this job. Now, will you please open the champagne? -Okay. -Okay. I quit once. I sold insurance. Worked for my brother. My brother's got plenty of money. My brother is younger than me, but he looks about 50. (LAUGHS) And after a while, I started to look like my brother. I got real nervous. I even started smoking. RICK: Ah, whatever happens, I'll finish out the summer. -I don't want to put you in a bind. -CAPTAIN: Thanks, I appreciate it.

Come on over to the house later and we can talk. If I'd been there ten minutes later, she might have pulled the whole thing off. It's over. Yeah. MR. REISMAN: I'd much rather speak to Cathy, if you don't mind. Will I see you later? I'll fix dinner. I'm gonna have to start paying rent. Only if you give up your place. Would you like that? Cathy, Mr. Reisman insists on speaking to you personally. He likes the Jackson you promised to Weinhart. All right, I'll be right there. Yes, I think I'd like it a lot. -How would David react? -He'd love it. An in-house swimming coach? Cathy, I must be going in a minute, dear. What about the neighbors? They're okay. Their Cathy? Shacked up with a lifeguard? A Porsche dealer. That makes a difference... Cathy, love, I really must! -Look, man, will you just shut up! -Rick! -You don't have to take that kind of crap! -He's a customer. He's a rude son of a bitch, too. Just take that one! It goes with the suit! Cathy, I'm sorry. Does the offer still stand? Yes. Can we both sleep on it? Of course. Okay. (SEAGULLS CAWING) (WAVES CRASHING) Putting in for overtime? Morning! Morning. I brought some coffee. -What's wrong? -Nothing. Today's my last day. -Back to school? -Yeah. -I kind of envy you. -Well, I'm resigned to it. Bullshit, Chris. It's a good deal and you know it. You sound like my old man. Yeah, I even sound like my old man. Hey, Lifeguard Rick! Machine Gun! What's happening? Where you been? -I had to go away with my parents. -Yeah? -School starts Monday, doesn't it? -Don't talk about it. Keep you out of trouble. Listen, I'm gonna take your advice... and I'm gonna work on getting laid. RICK: Yeah. Well, don't work on it too hard. You'll spoil all the fun. I'm gonna make it my project for the year. All right, man. Good luck. -I'll see you guys next summer. -Okay. What the hell's your real name anyway? Harold. Harold. Well, good luck, Machine Gun. (CAWS) Chris, you might as well just take off. -You sure? -Sure. Hell, it's your last day, man. Go on. Okay. -You have a good time up there. -I will. Crack a book, too. Otherwise you'll end up like me. Okay, Dad. Thanks for everything. -For what? -Well, everything. I really enjoyed working with you. I learned a lot. You're better off forgetting what you learned. Good luck. Okay, pal. You, too. Take care. -I hope everything works out for you. -Thanks. -See you around. -Adios. Swimmers in front of the toweri You're in a rip. Please move to the south.

What do you want hear first? Relax man. Just relaxi Anyway, the bad news is that one of my men quit this week. The good news is that I'd like... Take the phone off the hook. Christ, man! Everything was gonna be all right, just fine. -RICK: Why'd you reach for the tube then? -You guys are just like cops. You won't let a guy have a good time! -Sorry. -Shit. The hell with you! Do you have to deal with these idiots every day? It's typical. So what's the good news? Yeah, it's all right, Ron. -You said you had good news. -Right. The good news is that we got an opening... sooner than we thought and we'd like you to start on Monday. Can you make it? I don't think so, Larry. That's too bad. Listen... is there any way that you might be able to start before the 16th? Can't start at all. What do you mean? I mean I don't want the job. You don't want the job? Look, I don't want to sell cars for a living. Not even Porsches. Excuse me, Rick... but how long can you go on being a lifeguard? Just as long as they'll have me. Wow. Hey, look Larry, I really like this job. The hours are good... working conditions are fantastic... the pay isn't even that bad. Besides that, I like the fact that I'm goddamn good at it. You're giving up a hell of a good opportunity here. You know that? I might be passing up a lot more. (SIGHS) Oh, brother. What am I gonna say to Jack? You can tell that son of a bitch that he can... Lifeguard! -Yes, ma'am? -Come quick. There's a man in the ladies' room. I'll be right there. Look, Larry... I appreciate everything you did, man. Thanks. See you. You're making a very big mistake. I don't think so... but if I am, I'll let you know at the next reunion. Take the phone off the hook for me, will you? Yeah, sure, why not? I might as well be a lifeguard, too. I was standing right there, naked... and I happened to look down. Okay, man, come out and we'll talk about it. MAN: What do you want to talk about? About what the hell you're doing in the ladies' room. (MAN GRUNTS) I'm a policeman. We have this place under surveillance. RICK: Let me see your badge. (SIGHS) We don't use badges when we work undercover. Now get out of here, you're gonna blow the whole thing. Okay, man. Come on out or I'm gonna call the cops. Come on.
