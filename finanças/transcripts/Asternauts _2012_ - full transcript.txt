Morning Earl. Hope I didn't wake you up. What are you doing up there, Joe? I'm just putting the finishing touches on her. Ain't she a peach? Well what the hell is it? It's a subspace interstellar communications array, of course! And here we are, bottom of the 9th, the Rangers down by two. Thomas on third base, Gables on first, representing the tying run. Johnson takes the plate, it's been a rough night for the Rangers, and you can tell that tempers are running hot. Anderson's pitched a hell of a game this evening, but he has not done well against Johnson allowing- This is Joe McNut. Can anyone hear me please? Hello, hello? This is Earth, come in, over. Phil, what the hell you trying to do? Trying to contact me an alien race, Earl. Well do you have to do it now? I didn't know him. I suppose not. Hello space, come in over. This is Joe McNut. To space. Earl? What did you do? Probably some damn airplane toilet dropped its load. Then why are you taking your gun? Because whatever it is it's trespassing. You coming? One small step for, well wait up Earl. Hold on Earl, wait for me. This dang thing pulverized itself a cow. One cow, one bull. Now what are the chances of that happening? I've seen everything now. Except that, of course. Maybe you should poke it with a stick. I ain't poking it with no stick. That's it. Go on ahead, give her a good poke there. What, do you want me to do it? I don't know why you thought you had to go poke it with a stick. Get it all pissed off. Keep your voice down Joe. Now I suppose we'll have one of them intergalactic wars or something. Whole damn planet will probably be taken over. You and I'll be the first to go, but whatever. I said keep your voice down. Besides, there ain't no such thing as aliens. Then why are we hiding in a hay stack? Cuz whatever it is, it might be dangerous. I think I understand. You're a-feared of the unknown. I ain't no feared of the unknown. Yes, you is. No, I ain't. Yes, you is. No, I ain't. Yes, you is. Oh, now you all gone paranoid. How many times I gotta to say it? There ain't no such things as aliens! It's just you and me sitting on the porch and that's all it's ever going to be. Look Carl. Aliens! Is this your property? Yes ma'am, me and my brother Joel. I'm special agent Carlisle, with the NC66. Over the past several months we've been monitoring the deteriorating orbit of geostationary meteorological satellite number 216B4C10. At 21:21 number 216B4C10 succumbed to the planet's gravitational pull and we've since tracked its beacon to this location. We will now remove the satellite. Your cooperation, though mandatory, is appreciated. Excuse me, what about my cow? Sorry? Whatever the hell that thing is. It crashed into my field and blew up my stud bull and milking cow. We are not trained to respond to that. Your country thanks you. I suppose that's the government for ya, Joe. Hey, you dropped this. Throw it in the trash, Earl. It's garbage. You sure? I mean, you never know when those aliens will come down and. Makes you think though, doesn't it? About what? You know, about what's out there. Here we are, sitting on this porch night after night, drinking the same beers, never leaving this town. And one day, out of the blue, smack, here comes a goddamn weather satellite. Crashes into your field and turns your best bull into hamburger. And you realize we're not just sitting on this porch in the middle of this field, we are sitting on a front seat of a planet. That is shooting its way all across space. And who knows, maybe even time. In a way, Joel, You and me, we are astronauts. Yeah. I guess we is, ain't we? Hey Earl, that was awful good cow meat. Yeah, it wasn't half bad. Course it was probably crawling with radioactivity. Hey Earl. Lord what now? Sure is one nice night. Yeah, it is, isn't it? Hello, hello, this is Earth, come in, over.
