Let him write the cornball stuff, you should be writing rock and roll, that's what's happening. - That's what Mike keeps telling him. - Well, see 'cause Mikey's right for a change.

They got the song, they've already listened a master, we're ready to go. - Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, Murray, let's slow down, please. I mean, the big record companies are saying that this teen music thing is already over with. They're saying it's already peaked. But for a little guy like me to survive, who knows, maybe this surfin' craze will be the next big thing, huh? - Then you'll release the record? - Not if they're gonna call themselves the Pendletones. - Hey, Russ, you make my boys a deal, you can call them whatever you like. - It's better than being called the Lifeguards. - Beach Bums would have been cooler. - Well, what's wrong with the Pendletones? - Yeah, at least we could have got some free shirts, from the company. - Yeah. - Denny. - What's with you? - Who are we kidding, they're not gonna play it this weekend. Pop just gave it to the guys yesterday. - Hey Dennis, don't tell anyone but guess whose folks are going out of town? - I'll call you later. - Is there any girl in Redondo Beach you haven't been with? - Two or three. - Two or three. - Two or three.

(boys holler and laugh) (guitar music) - Your boys go on during the break, Mr. Wilson and lots of luck, you'll need it. - What's that suppose to mean? - Well, let's just say, sir, lots of bands try out through this place and some have more polish than others. Just kids. - Look, bud, my boy, Brian, God bless him has more talent in his pinky than all those other bands put together. With me in their corner, these kids will go to the top of the charts, top of the world. - Yeah, sure, bud. (audience cheers) - Hey, you guys come on, let's go. - [Announcer] Thank you very much guys and gals. - This is a big mistake, we're not ready to play live. - When then so we'll play dead.

Yes, (indistinct). - They like us. - Because we stunk. - Where's my dad? - Probably ran for cover. - Which is what you oughta do until you learn to play those drums. - That was the worst 15 minutes of my life. - Come here. It was a big thing. I mean, it was cool hearing our song on the radio, it's all over now, it's okay. - No it's not. Dad, I know we were pretty awful out there tonight, but we'll practice, or I'll write better songs, we'll show them. - Brian. - No, we'll be top of the charts, top of the world, just like you said. - Let me tell you something you did a bang up job out there, all of you. You played your hearts out. - You're not mad. - Yeah, I'm mad, mad at anyone who tried to book a brand new act during intermission for no money. Don't worry, I'm gonna find a major record company to back us. I think we can set up our publishing company, that's where the money is. That way we can handle everything ourselves. But, it's not gonna work if you won't listen to me. - Whatever it takes, Pop. - It's gonna take writing the kind of songs that'll sell, I know what'll sell. And you have to want it as much as I do.

(slow music) (Brian cries) (Mom hushes Brian) - I was really out there in Fruit Loops land for awhile but I'm feeling like a totally new man now. - That's the important thing. - The important thing is you guys pulled off the tour without me. - Thanks to Glen Campbell. - What was it like working with him? - He's all right for a session guy. - Campbell thinks he's gonna make it as a solo act someday. (boys laugh) - You know what might be good, you remember a Bruce Johnston from The Rip Chords, "Hey Little Cobra?" He's a nice guy and he's better looking than me. - What are you saying, Brian? - I can't go out on the road anymore. - What? - Well, hey don't worry. - Don't worry, without you we might as well throw in the towel. - No, what are you thinking that I'm quitting the Beach Boys? Man, it's what I live for. And staying home will give me time, to you know, write songs that'll give The Beatles a run for their money. Nothing's gonna change, I promise. - Yeah, well one thing better change, you can blame your little episode on the tour if you want to, I think it's because all the dope you've been smoking. - You been using marijuana? - You guys sound like Pop. - Tell the truth, Bri. - Okay, yeah, I experimented with it a little, I mean, everyone's doing it, it's a groove, it's what's happening. - Not for me. - Listen, if it begins to affect my music, I'll put it down in a minute.

Can we ask you just a couple questions please? Shannon Harris filed a paternity action against you in superior court this morning. - What? - Are you father of baby Shawn? - Excuse me. (Dennis laughs) - What are you laughing at, you'll sleep with anything that walks. - Oh is that right, he's so full of it. - Hey, what's happening? (dogs barking) - So? - So, it sounds like a pack of barking dogs. (man laughs) - Right on. - You're not really gonna put those mutts on the album. - You know, all I ever get from you guys is negative vibes. Negative vibes. - You know that could be Brian. - Man, you can put me down all you want but I just can't write about little miss cheerleader on the beach anymore. I have got to move on. - All right, fine, times are changing, we'll change with them but that doesn't give you the right to freeze us out. - Yeah, well I'm trying to make the greatest rock-n-roll album ever made. - With barking dogs and pounding spoons and love songs to God. - Whatever, hey, why don't you go collaborate with Pop on the many moods of Murray Wilson. (rock music) - He sucks on that damn pipe all day, don't he? - Phil Spector says what he's laying down is pure genius. - Is that why your brother turned his living room into a giant sandbox? I say this is our band. - Well, I say we let Brian finish the greatest album ever made. - Hey, Denny, want a toke? - No, I'm a vodka and lime kind of guy from way back. - Let's go, come on. You can have pudding if you wash your hands, sweetie, go on. - Oh, you're home early. - Who's here? - A friend of Brian and Marilyn's. - Shelly, come here.

(psychedelic guitar music) - Hi, Dennis, remember me? - I believe you picked up some of my girls who checked into Malibu yesterday. We got a lot in common, you and me. You're a musician, I'm a musician but you don't care much for soul music. I predict the race wars coming that will be the end of the world as we know it. Have you ever been to an orgy. - Who is he? - It's the guy I told you about. That's Charlie Manson. - I'm so over my head, I don't know which end is up anymore. - Well, let me put it in perspective for you, Dennis, Manson has fleeced you for over $100,000. - I don't care about the money. - Without Brian, your records aren't selling, your concerts aren't drawing- - Just shut up and tell me what you're gonna do to help me. - Okay, calm down and start worrying about what's important. Dennis, just put this Manson stuff behind you, all right, I'm telling you, it's all gonna blow over. (dramatic music) - [Reporter] The self-styled guru of a bizarre hippie cult, Charles Manson has been formally charged along with three young women in the gruesome murders of famed actress Sharon Tate and five others last August. The Tate-LaBianca murders were among the most violent crimes this nation has ever seen. It is not known how Charles Manson and his followers will plea. (motorcycle revs) (dramatic music) (Dennis knocks) - Dennis. - I'm in trouble pop. Can I come in? - Sure. - At first it was truly like being on a commune. The girls would bake bread and they'd sew and it was wild and free but there was no violence. But even with Manson in jail, I mean, he's got girls on the outside that would cut me in a second. - Should have thought about that before you let them spend all your money. But that's not your trouble. You know what your trouble is, Dennis. You never listened to me and neither did Brian. That's why the band's all washed up. - Well, I should have known better than to come to you. - Don't talk to me in that tone. I spent a lot of sleepless nights thinking about the state of your life and Brian's. And I think I've come up with a solution. - What, what, what are you saying? - I said the deal is $700,000 cash. - For what, for what? - For 100% of the songs. - No, please, no, please, please. - How can you be so cruel? - It's a good deal Marilyn, it's cash. It's the best I could do. - You can't, you can't sell my music, please, oh no. - Pop, these songs are like Brian's children. - Look at it, got bands today Deep Purple, Vanilla Fudge, Iron Butterfly don't record "Little Deuce Coupe." But we gotta face it, the songs have no value. They were a fad, they're worthless, completely worthless. (Brian cries) - Why don't you see if you can lay it on a little harder. - It's not my fault if he can't cut it. - Well, who's fault is it, Dad?

Brian, I have something to tell you. Something you're not ready to hear. Your father is gone. (slow music) Murray's dead, honey. (slow dramatic music) - You okay? Dad, it's hard separating family thing from the music thing. But he's the only dad we had and for Mom I think we should all be at the funeral. - I don't know, Carl, I'm going through some changes, I don't feel so good. - If you don't go to the funeral, you'll never come to terms with him. Don't turn away, Dennis, you know what I'm talking about. If you and Brian don't put him in the ground, you'll never be rid of him. Don't make me go there by myself. - I'll be there. (slow dramatic music) - [Pastor] Dear Lord in time of sadness we turn to you, in times of loss we turn to you for meaning. We (indistinct). We pray for a peaceful rest for our loved one. (dramatic piano music) - [Marilyn] Brian refuses to get any kind of psychiatric treatment. I threatened if he don't, I'm gonna walk out, it doesn't make a difference. He thinks (indistinct). He won't get out of bed, I can't even get him to take a shower, he thinks there's poison gas in the shower. Last month, (indistinct) dropped by the house and Brian was petrified, he started sobbing and then he locked himself in the pool house until I went out there- (Brian knocks) - Let me in. (Brian knocks) Let me in. Why are you telling him everything? - He's a therapist. - But it's like a regular thing, it's like he's here everyday or something. Well, if you're gonna talk to him, I wanna talk to him too. - Brian, meet Dr. Landy. - Come in, Brian. (dramatic piano music) - [Dennis] Did you sleep with him? You can tell me, Karen, did you sleep with him! It's a simple yes or no. - Well, I'm not gonna answer that, not until you tell me about you and little Gracie. Ow, Dennis, you're hurting me! - Did you sleep with Elliot? - No, all right, no, we're just friends. Are you satisfied now? - Go to hell. - You hypocrite, you go out on that road and you jump any hippie with a stone around her neck but you expect me just to- (glass breaks) Oh, look at mister macho, mister tough guy, huh. - I want you out of my life, right now! Get out! (dark music) - Fine, I'm out of here. (dark music) - You wanna know about little Gracie, huh? The truth is we do it every which way we can. You're out of my life, gone. (water splashes) Finished, it's over! (water splashes) (Brian breathes heavy) - Oh, I gotta take a break, let's just break, come on, let me catch my breathe. - Okay, okay. - Oh, man. - Oh, gross, Jack LaLane. - Hey, how did you know I was gonna be here? - Oh, come on, man, they've been putting you through the same paces for months, six mile runs, cardiovascular funk. I mean, what's next bowling for dollars? You must be bored out of your mind. - I'm bushed. - Let's cut out. Come on, man. I got the burgers, I got the fries, I got the coke. That's a workout. Come on. (Dennis laughs) (upbeat music) - Go, just go, go, go away, man, go, go. (piano music) - Yo bummer man, machine's not on. - Dennis. - All right, we're rolling now. (Dennis laughs) You're the only guy in the world that can blow two grams and still be hungry. - I'm a growing boy. - You know you're not gonna grow creatively until you dump Landy. - I cut him loose man, he cost too much. - Man, now you're talking, Brian Wilson doesn't need anybody. You're the genius man, without you the band is nowhere. - Man, Carl wants me to go on tour with you guys and do Brian is back kind of thing. - It'd be easy, you just play them a couple of oldies, that's all they wanna hear from us. - That's so freaky. - It's nostalgia, man, everybody's into it these days. - Man, Pop must be turning over in his grave. - Jerk. (slow music) - And he sold me out for the short money, he never believed in anything I did. - He worshiped you. - Oh yeah, is that why he hit me. You know, that's why I've never been able to hear my music, any music on the stereo, that's why he hit me in the ear. You remember. - I remember he used to beat the crap out of me till I learned how to fight back. - You think about him a lot, huh? He hated us. - He loved us.

First you get him hooked again and then you try to set up a drug deal on a microphone. - It was a joke. - Joke's on you, you're out of the band, buckwheat! - He started it, he started it! Oh, he's trying to kick me out of the band, huh? - I know. - What, you're on his side? - You've gotta clean up your act, Dennis. I can't responsible for you anymore.

Mike Love. - Oh, you're Shaun, baby Shaun. (laughs) Oh. Would you like to take a walk on the beach? (Dennis laughs) - You wanna know the biggest single mistake of my life, getting married again, the biggest. - Yeah, well if you hate me so much, why don't you just divorce me? - Because of Gage. A little boy needs his pop around. - You're too weird for words. - And what would you know about it? You never had a real father anyway. - What good is a father if he's drunk all the time? - That's what's so sick about you. You're so hung up trying to be Mike Love's daughter, you don't even know how to be a decent mother. (baby cries) (door slams) - Let her go, Denny, life's too short, man. - Salute, salute. - [Reporter] In the capital today, Secretary James Watts announced that The Beach Boys will be barred from performing at the 4th of July party on Washington's Mall. In a memo, Watt charged that The Beach Boys attract the wrong element and said that their performances created drug and alcohol problems. Watts said that this year's 4th of July celebration should point to the glories of America in a patriotic inspirational way. - Who the hell is this guy? - James Watts, Secretary of the Interior. - [Man] James Watts has substituted Wayne Newton for The Beach Boys. - This is great, oh god, what a set up. - I didn't even know you were touring with the band again. - Oh, man as long as I show up sober, they don't give thought, wrong element. Yeah, Brian is gonna blow his mind when he hears about this. - [Brian] Hi, leave your name and number after the beep. - Ever since he hooked up with Landy again. I gotta go up to Malibu. Chucky, put this on my tab, will you, I gotta see my brother. - Dennis. - It's covered. (Brian laughs) - I don't believe it. - Long time no see. I've been trying to get in touch with you for 10 months. Your shrink's got it in for me. Hey did you hear the Secretary of Interior said we can't play DC on the 4th of July? We're (indistinct). - Mike's been on the phone with the White House. - Oh yeah. - Yeah, we'll probably get invited there instead of the Mall. - That's cool. Check this out. - No. - Oh yeah, come on, man, we'll jam, we'll get high, it'll be like old times. What's the matter with you, we're talking pure Bolivian honey here. - I'm gonna pull an Elvis man. I'm exercising and I'm eating right, I can hear music in my head again just like before. I don't do drugs anymore. - We'll just hang out. - You know, you can do it too, Dennis. You could turn your life around. - Don't worry about me, I'm better than I've ever been. You remember that time Dad took us down to the pike, we went on that roller coaster ride?
