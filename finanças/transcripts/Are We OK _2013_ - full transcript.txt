Many thanks to author Hakan Gunday... for being such an Inspiration for this movie through his novels. Don't be afraid. I'm your favorite everything and everyone... in a form collected into one body. I'm no ghost or phantom. I'm a man, just like you. Remember when you wake up. Don't forget my face. Find me. Wake up. Wake up. Wake up! What the hell was that all about? Good morning! Look who's up, look who's awake! What a dream, Princess... It needs to be told to the water, as my grandmother always said. Was that you? What am I saying? Look here, Leia. Today, if we can make our coffee without the red light going off... and without the coffee machine shaking... it will mean that this dream will be good news. Yes! Okay, Leia. We will leave soon. Don't hurry. Don't ruin my coffee. You want everything to happen immediately. Yes, Princess. Today, if we can get to the park in three songs... it will be a marvelous day. Should we accept this challenge? We should. Slow down! Damn it! We couldn't make it. Come on. Good girl, good girl. Come on. Good morning! Why are you yelling so early in the morning? Temmuz, maybe you should buy yourself a printer already. I'm leaving my work place to come up here. There's no way I will come again. You can come pick it up yourself. Good morning! So what, is it a bad thing? You get to walk. Leia, my princess! Are you pooping and peeing? Just poop everywhere. Whoa. We don't speak so openly around her. She's still going through puberty. Don't put my girl through embarrassing traumas. "Little Duckling in Pink Boots". That's ridiculous. What's next? What kind of a high are these children's books authors on? It's a story about a tiny duckling that's afraid of water. That's why it wears the boots. Aren't ducklings little anyway? They just have to write it out in those children's books. They think children are idiots? Temmuz, aren't we also like a clich? children's book story right now? You, me, a dog. In a park. Think about it. Think of a name for it. "What Happened to Temmuz, Beste, and little Leia?" I'm so going to throw up on you now... but I'm holding it back because Leia is between us. - Let's get a cup of coffee. Come on. - Come on, girl, get up. Come. I'm fine, mom. I'm trying to empathize with a confused duckling right now. I'm working, yes. No, you're not interrupting. If anyone is to interrupt, it should be you, my mother! The plane is landing tonight. There was a meeting in Ankara. They're "marrying" companies, that sort of thing. Well, we'll have to go to that wedding. Do we sit on the bride's side or the groom's... That, I don't know. You rich folks, you know how it works best. Okay, okay, don't get mad, mom. I'm not drinking, mom. Stop asking me that. Look, I'm drinking soda. Here, listen. Okay? Did you hear that? We are good, mom. Don't worry, we're great. Okay, bye bye. Please leave your message after the tone. The person you have called cannot be reached at the moment. My love! Where are you? I miss you so much. Call me when you get this. Our encounter is near. Don't be afraid! Oh, but enough is enough! What's going on, Princess? Hello, my love? Have you landed? Come over right now, or I will die here. I keep having this ridiculous dream. Good thing you called and woke me up. Was that you in my crazy dream? Come quickly. I miss you so much. I want to hold you right now. Okay, I'll shut up. Don't shout. I don't understand. Alright. Baby, what are you talking about? What is in my e-mails? Okay, I'll look, okay. Hello? Temmuz, I took a few days off. I won't be in Istanbul. I'm off to a coastal location. I didn't want to e-mail you, I'd like to have talked to you. But there's no way to talk to you, because you don't listen. You'll start explaining yourself to me again. No relationship starts just so that it can finish. Yes, it is wished to last. Yes, dreams are set about it. But you dreamed so much that you forgot about reality. You haven't even noticed... ...that I've been like a corpse around you for the last three months. You always said "we're OK", but we weren't, Temmuz. I'm tired of you holding on to me like you have nothing else in life. I'm tired of you smothering me. I'm tired of you running to a bottle at every hardship... your "life hurts" nonsense and your Bohemian artist act. I'm tired of the nights and the mornings... ... when I have to run after you... to pick you up from the streets you fell, threw up, and crapped on. While I'm working like crazy... I'm tired of you calling me constantly... ...knowing that I'm in a meeting or something... just to ask me what to cook for dinner. I'm tired of your paranoia and your palpitations... ... when I can't call you back or pick up the phone for two minutes. I'm tired of carrying you, Temmuz. In the world of your imagination... I'm tired of watching only you and your dreams, Temmuz. You're so far away from reality. The sculptures you think you sold at the exhibitions... your mother and I were the ones buying them. Just so that you could be happy. You know, so that you could earn some money. I'm sorry for this slap, Temmuz... but perhaps it will bring you to your senses. It was for your own good. It's over, Temmuz. But it's not the end of the world. You'll be fine, you'll heal. Be good and don't go drinking. Dude, what kind of a high Hello! Do you need anything? Why don't you just go away, bro? You guys too, huh? Pick up the damn phone! The person you have called cannot be reached at the moment. Please leave your message after the tone. Now, look, I'm going to count to three. If you can talk, none of these things will have happened. Okay? Are you ready for the most difficult challenge? Come on. One. Two. Three. We lost! Wake up! Not even a phone call. Am I so easy to forget? Now, what if I count to ten... Temmuz! If you start with the "what ifs", I swear, I will leave. My friend... I know, it's not a good time, but... The guys are waiting for the drawings. Do you know those people? - Who? - That kid in the wheelchair. I've seen them around. It's so sad. - It's the first time I'm seeing them. - Could be. No, it's not like that. Temmuz, for God's sake, what are you saying? No way! I'm having a very intense d?ja vu moment right now. Whoa, I'm so overwhelmed right now. Temmuz, you've probably seen them before but didn't notice it. I don't know, maybe it registered somewhere in your mind... No, no. I didn't see him here. It's him. - Beste! - What? Take Princess home. Take the keys, lock the door. I'll come pick them up from your office. Temmuz! Have you gone crazy, what are you doing? Sir, open the middle door for us! Wait, wait! - Ma'am, let me help you. - God bless you. Open that ramp for me, please. - Alright. - Thank you, brother. Thank you. One second. Ma'am, come on over here. Thank you. You didn't get burned in the sun, did you? We can put lotion on you when we get home. Come on. Thank you, brother. God sent you to us today. Look at that, you get off here too! Yes, what a coincidence. Who are you? What are you doing here? I'm working for social services. Are you serious? I'm really surprised. We take Ihsan to their meetings sometimes. Today is Sunday, it's sea day. He loves to stare at the sea. Yes. Actually, it wasn't a total coincidence. When I saw you, I wanted to help... as well as to find an appropriate moment... to talk about something. Now is appropriate. You talk, we'll listen. What is it about? Now, uh... By the way, I'm sorry. I didn't introduce myself. My name is Temmuz. I'm Feride. What a nice name, and warm, just like the month of July in summer. I'm Temmuz. Oh, I'm so sorry! I'm so sorry! - It happens a lot. - I was off guard like an idiot. No, no, don't feel bad, we are used to it. I'm Ihsan. Nice to meet you, Ihsan. So, what were you going to tell us just now? It's about a social services project. Volunteers like me find a disabled friend and... read them books, three days a week. So, you are going to read to us. Ihsan knows how to read, but... If you want me to. Of course, why not? Is it a textbook? No, it's not. More like a novel. Would you like that, Ihsan? Of course he would, that would be very nice. Look, we live right here. I'll set you up a spot in the garden, we can make tea as well. What a lovely way to pass the time. Let's ask his father also, right? Okay, then, I will be here tomorrow at 11:00 am. I'll bring my ID card and documentation... to ensure you that I'm reliable. We trust you, why shouldn't we? You're no thug! Okay, let me write down your address. I can fill out the paperwork then. Carnation Neighborhood, Daisy Street. Our street always smells of flowers, you know. "Mom" Are we OK? What do you say? You must be completely out of your mind, I say. You are worth a thousand maniacs. Okay, I'm out. Thank you. Now, watch. "Hello. Hi there! Mrs. Feride, yesterday..." I don't want to answer your calls. I told you all I had to say. I called your mother and apologized to her. It hurts me too. But it will pass. You'll be okay, we'll survive. Please be strong and don't drink. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16. Temmuz, welcome. Thank you. Good morning. Ismail! We should talk with his father as well. Of course, yes. Hello, I'm Temmuz. - Welcome, brother. - Thank you. Feride, make a cup of coffee. - How do you like your coffee? - Medium sweet. Go on, please. So, how are you? I hope you are doing well. Things are good. Just working and bustling about, that's all. Brother Temmuz, let me get right to the point: Feride told me a little bit. Look, this is a small neighborhood. - Sure. - Everybody knows each other. Certainly. If you have any reservations... Of course, you are doing something nice with the social services. But here, it's seen as a grown man coming to our home. Of course, people talk, rumors spread. Sure, I bet you are an honest guy. Don't get me wrong, but Feride is here alone. And people will just keep on talking nonsense. I understand, of course. You don't need to worry at all. If it's going to be a problem... No, we'll take care of it. Here's what we'll do: I'm not at home during the day. Until you arrive, Feride will have gone to the neighbor's. She goes to clean homes two or three days out of the week anyway. You can sit with Ihsan and read him a book or something, or do what you do. Sure. If necessary, I can take Ihsan to the park. There, we can continue to read. After all, this program intends to boost morale. To make our friends like Ihsan feel better about themselves. What can Ihsan feel, for God's sake? He just sits there. What else can happen? At most... That's the way it is. - Bring it, bring it. - Here. Thank you. I'm going to the neighbor's. - Okay, then, take it easy. - Thank you. - I'll bring Ihsan. - Sure. Let me help you. Here we go. I'm going to Aysel's place. If you need to go pee, tell Temmuz to call me. You can call me about anything you need. I will be at my neighbor, Aysel's place. I've taken him to the toilet. He won't need to pee for about two hours or so. You can give him water if he asks for it. Yeah, sure. - Okay, take it easy. - Good bye. - How are you, Ihsan? - Good. Don't be scared, your job is not that hard. I'm sitting just fine like this, no problem. Yeah, no problem, come on... - So, you're not stressed. - No, I'm not. Why would I be? Cool. Give me a high five, bro! But you're pulling my leg here. Yeah, go ahead, laugh away... Good for you. But if you want, I can give you a high five. How so? Now, say "That's cool, bro." - That's cool, bro. - High five. - Wow. - See? You thought you could just have your way with me, huh? Come on. Are you ready? Look, this book got a lot of praise. I have wanted to read it for a long time. Nice coincidence. But if you don't like it, tell me. We can change it for another book. Oh, by the way, I put the permission form here. You can get your father to sign it in the evening. I also wrote my number and my address down, just in case. What do you want from us? - What should I want? I told you... - Do you think I'm stupid? ID cards, book readings, this and that. There is no such world. In fact, you followed us to the bus stop. I didn't fall for it. Dude, why did you come here? What do you want from us? Look, if you're here out of pity, you can leave right now. I can't handle that treatment. I saw you in my dreams. Look, don't take it the wrong way. I mean... How should I say it? Now, you'll think I'm crazy. You summoned me. You wanted me to find you. There's something you want from me, or it's the other way around. I don't know, I think it's mostly because I want something from you. I don't know what it is. But I think we will be of help to each other. Somehow, this will help both of us. I believe in this dream. So, we... Look, I know, it's ridiculous. But you said "Our salvation is near." I know it was you. And then, I saw you there... At the park. I saw you, the boy from my dreams. Okay, I should leave now. I've been talking nonsense. Stop. Stop! I believe you, man. Come on, bro, sit. Don't go. I believe you, and your dream. I also had the same dream. Look, I don't like to beat around the bush. Yes, there really is something that I want from you. Tell me, what is it? I want you to kill me. I don't get it. Yes, you do. - What do you mean? - It's pretty straightforward. If I had limbs, I'd do it myself. I've tried a few times. I threw myself out of bed and stuff, but... nothing happened. I just got a bruised face. Got it, bro? No. You're crazy, brother. I'm sorry. Temmuz, what happened? He got bored, he didn't want it. If you want to do something... I wonder why he didn't like it. He likes to watch movies and stuff every once in a while. Was it the book? I don't know, you should check on him yourself. Aysel, I'm going home. It's Beste. They gave the job to someone else. Of course they would... it's not like they were going to wait for me, is it? That's nice, isn't it? Someone wants me to be a killer. The other gives my job to someone else. Another says "get out of my life". Oh, big world, how is it that you can't fit me in? Let's finish this at least, so we can get money for your food. Or I won't be able to keep you by my side either. But so what if I finish it? Who can we sell it to? Who are you, brother? Show me your face! This must surely be a harbinger of disaster. It's worse. Run to the shelter. It's my mom. Do you realize that I've called you a hundred times? Do you want to kill me? No, I'm supposed to kill someone else. Who? What are you talking about? You are slowly killing us all already, don't worry. Your home has turned into a dumpster. Early tomorrow, I will send Serif here. Yes, let's see what we have got here. Mom, don't pour it out. Don't pour it, mom, let go! Temmuz... Temmuz, please, don't. This is life. Whenever something goes wrong... you act as if it's the end of the world. Please don't be so fragile. Don't be so emotional. Let go! You start to cry when an ant is killed. You are on top of the world when flowers bloom. Stop seeing everything! Don't see it, stop noticing, let it go. It's just an ant, doomed to be crushed. It has been created that way, what can you do about it? Come on, baby, please. Pull yourself together. Don't you see what kind of shape you are in? I am together. I'm real from head to toe. Have I ever lied to you? You're the ones who lied. Who's the one who lied to her own son when buying those sculptures? It's because I don't know how I'm supposed to help you! Because you're exhausting all my efforts. I love you so much. I love you so much, but I don't know how to help you. It hurts so much, mom... I know, dear. I know, son. Of course your sculptures are not sold. Because they are too good. Your statues are similar to your soul... always moving forward ahead of you. Oh, mom, why didn't you wake me up? I became a couch potato again. Mom? Temmuz, hold on, Ihsan had me call you. Hi, Temmuz. Brother, I'm sorry, I was a little upset today, that's all. If you're not doing anything, can you come back tomorrow? Oh... I mean, yeah, sure. I'm sorry too. I mean, I'll come. Okay, we'll be expecting you. We had a match, it was insane. I was scoring goals and throwing fakes and all. Ihsan! - Hello. - Welcome, dude! Thank you. Brother, we hear you're reading to him, don't overdo it. Then he comes and gives us lectures about it. Shut up, man! We should get going, bro. "Write, write about us." Write the book that is proof that we have come to the end of it all. Because he was holding a gun... I should have taken what he was saying as an order... but I had welcomed that idea more as a plea in my mind. But now, sitting across from me was an old friend, who wanted to do this. And if I didn't comply, he was prepared to take my life... "...a life not at all as valuable as his." What the hell is this? I'm fed up, let's stop for now. You're not fed up. You like it too, keep reading. - No. - Read, bro. I said "no", it's over. Look, the book says the same thing. I'm telling you, dude. There is something to all this. I mean, you saw me in your dreams, I saw you in mine. Bro, all this is not a coincidence. I tried to tell you that yesterday, but you didn't believe me. And the book says the same thing. Kill me. You'll be doing me a favor. You'll be heaven-bound in the end. Ihsan, for the love of God, shut up. I do love God. That's why I want to go to Him. And when I go, I want to ask Him why He made me this way. There is a reason. There has to be. Okay, brother, that's what I want to find out. I couldn't find the answer so far, I can't find it. To find out, I need to go to Him. Am I wrong, man? Temmuz! Ihsan! Take a break from reading a little, let's eat. Okay, I'm leaving anyway. You can eat comfortably. I won't let you leave. Have a bite to eat first. Don't go, buddy, let's eat. I mean, his mother is such a sweet woman. Even when she's just serving beans, her face just lights up when sharing. I mean, through all that hardship, how can she keep a smile on her face? What kind of will to live is that? How can she hang on to life so tightly? Maybe that's why the kid wants to die. Maybe he thinks his mother is pretending. No, there's no pretense in the woman's attitude. Maybe he's just being a spoiled teenager. I swear to God, I don't understand. How am I supposed to understand? Is it even possible to understand it? You're not going to take him seriously, I hope. It's ridiculous to even ask. Well, don't ask, then. What are you on, girl? Are you crazy? Crazy people have a tendency to bond quickly. - Come on, let's go. I have to sculpt. - At this late hour? What can I do, I've gotta make a living. Temmuz, look at me. If we get any new work, I'll pass it on to you, okay? But please make sure you finish it. You're really starting to lose their trust, be careful. - Okay, don't worry, come on. - Let's go. Save me! Set me free! Save me! Set me free! Save me, brother. Set me free. Okay. Convince me. - How? - Tell me why. Why? The reason is right in front of you. I'm right here. Okay, I'll tell you. Let's say you get bored, you want to go out one day. That's all there is to it, buddy. What more do you want me to say? Should I tell you about how my father hates me for being born this way? Let's skip that. I don't really care about that. But my mom... What about my mom? I'm a burden to her every single day. Look, I'm not saying it to upset you. I just want you to understand. This is the first time I'm openly expressing myself. I'm bored, bro. I'm tired. I'll never be able to hug and kiss a girl. What more can I say, buddy? You know what we should do? You know, it's summer. We leave the windows open every night. You come right over. The house is on the ground floor. You enter through the window. Then, you can press a pillow over my face and leave after. In the morning, you can come to read for me again, as if nothing happened. You can act like you're surprised. As if nothing happened. Nobody will suspect a thing, I swear. I already told you about my father. He won't complain about it. And my mother... My mother will shed a tear or two, but then, she'll go on living. I'll get to ask Him my question. And you'll go to heaven for your good deed, probably. This is the meaning of your dream, bro. It turned out good, you see? It's for the best for all. - Alright. - What? Okay, I'm going to kill you. Really? Don't lead me on. Really, yes. - Swear. - I swear, bro. High five, bro! - But I have one condition: - Tell me, bro. This book will be finished. We won't leave it halfway, okay? Okay, but you're going to read fast every day, like 50 pages or so. No way, you'll leave me out of breath. Look at you laugh! You pamper someone enough, they'll go crap on your head. How can you always be so funny, man? Okay, let's call it a day, that's enough. Okay, we agreed on that. Now, I've got one last requirement. Well, tell me. You'll tell me what you want to do most in life. What is this, are we in a movie? Tell me! Okay, let me think. I'll tell you when it comes to mind. Let me think. Look, it should be something we can do. It shouldn't be money or property. I'm not rich, you know. Come on, bro, who cares about that, as long as you're fine? Let's do a little workout now. Are you up for it? - What workout? - Are you ready? Dude, dude... Dude, stop. Faster! Come on, come on! Mr. Hayri, soak us too, soak us! Are they crazy? Have they gone mad? I got it. - I found my wish. - What is it? There was a movie that I watched with my mother. - "Titanic". - Yes, I know it. You know Leonardo, the blond guy. He goes to the prow of the ship with open arms... and he shouts "I'm the king of the world". I don't know where, but I want to be somewhere high up... I want to open my arms and shout "I'm the king of the world". With open arms. How are we going to do that? I don't know, bro. You asked me, and I answered. This is your puzzle to solve. Temmuz?. Temmuz! What's up, man? How's it going? It's good, we were in the park, over there. Of course, this book thing is pretty good and all... I want to tell you something, Temmuz. Maybe you can talk with social services... and maybe get some support for us. You know, some aid or an allowance. - I don't understand, sir. - You do, man. Our situation is obvious, let us get a few bucks out of this. I mean, it's for Ihsan, don't misunderstand me. You're coming and going and all, that's fine... but this can't keep on going this way. You people should make more of an effort. Or else, it will be difficult. You can't keep coming all the time. Come on, you got the point. Take good care of yourself. Good day. You're here. Here you go, sir. Give me that too, Temmuz. You want me to buy you a tea? No, sir, thanks. Well, see you later. Temmuz hasn't been here for two days. He says he has work to do. Did you say something to him? What are you talking about? What can I say to him? Your father didn't say anything, son. You asked him for money, didn't you? Don't make me beat you up! Ismail, for God's sake, don't. Ihsan, you shut up. I won't shut up. Call Temmuz, call Temmuz! Temmuz! - Feride, shut him up! - Temmuz! Shut up! Temmuz! - Temmuz! - God damn you both! You have ruined my youth! You have finished my life! God damn you both! I've got 22 pieces in hand. But I was stuck on that bust that I haven't been able to complete. "Forget it", I said. It can work without it. - Right. - I spoke with Beste. In two or three months, she will arrange a gallery for me in Galata. You'll see, I'll hold that exhibition. Well, bravo. But you're invited to come only as a guest. If I hear that you've made a purchase... Okay, okay. So, can I get my friends to buy some? The posh ones. That's okay. - You look really good. - Mom, don't worry, I'm fine. I'm trying. I'm attacking life, I'm wrestling in the middleweight class. I wonder, to what do we owe this change? Or whom? To a friend. No, it is not like that. Let's say, more like to a brother. He reminds me of what I need to do, he shakes me up. Gosh... I wonder what's the secret of this brother. Based on him doing what I couldn't, he must be pretty interesting. Yes, he is. It's a mystery, an enigma. It's a puzzle I need to solve. For now, I'm trying to find the answers. But no matter what the outcome is, I will be very happy. - Is this another challenge? - No, it's not a challenge. It's a collision. It's more like a confrontation. I swear to God, my dear, whoever you collided with... good thing you did. I'm very happy to see you like this. How is my father? As usual. Unpleasant. Oh, don't mention him. Come on. Let's drink to us. In the meantime, don't forget breakfast, okay? At Demircikoy, on Sunday. I'll pick you up from your home at around 9:30 am. - Hello? - Temmuz! He just went to sleep. I didn't know what to do. I'm sorry I disturbed you at this hour. Don't say that. Of course, you can call me. I wish you had called me earlier. How could I have known that this would happen? That pig slammed the door and left. He won't show up until the morning. If he does, he will come back drunk and beat us both up. Should I stay here tonight? But that would also be a problem, right? Let me take Ihsan, then. Let him stay with me for a few days. Of course, if Ismail doesn't mind it. He won't. You can tell him that we went to the social services center. I will. You can say that we'll stay there for a few days. He will be grateful. He will calm down if he doesn't see him for a few days. Although, it would be better if he never saw him again. I already know, he will leave us soon and go away. I know, I know. He will leave us. - Are you going to be able to do it? - Do what? Look after him? Of course. I mean... I think I can. It's just because Ihsan wants to, not that I'm afraid of Ismail. He can go to hell, he knows the way out. But my baby wants to be with you. This will be the first time I will be separated from him. You can call me if you need anything. Ihsan will tell you what to do. Don't be shy around him. You've become like his big brother. You are the first person to put a smile on his face. I can never repay you. I have nothing to give you, except my blessing. I hope you'll live a long life, but one day, when we are gone... I will speak to the angels on your behalf. I will say: "Don't ask him, don't ask him. Temmuz is the most innocent person in the world. I bear witness." Thank you. Dude. Is that you? Come on, I got you. Dude, this is not tiring for you, is it? No, man, this is good exercise for me. I'm out of shape. Do you know the myth of Sisyphus? No, I don't. In mythology, he rolls a boulder up a mountain, non-stop. But the boulder always rolls back down. So, he goes back down to get it, goes up and down, up and down. Okay, brother, thank you very much. No problem, good evening. That is Sisyphus. Never mind him, he's a jerk. Where is that half a son of yours? Temmuz took him to the social services center. Make yourself comfortable, you won't see him for a few days. Good. Let him go to hell. I hope he doesn't come back to this house again. Great, then, make yourself comfortable, go sit on your thumbs. Has he really gone? I feel horny, woman. - Back off! - Come, come. Back off! Stop, stop! You can't escape, where are you going to go? - Good morning. - Good morning. - Did Leia wake you? - No, she's just lying there quietly. Alright. Are we going to the toilet now? Alright. Okay. - Dude, I'm embarrassed, I can't go. - Don't be silly, bro, relax. Maybe you can make a sound or something. Maybe it will become easier. Tell me something. Okay, what should I tell you? Tell me about yourself, you never have. - I'm like you, you know. - What do you mean, like me? I'm different. I'm different since birth. That's how I am to other people. I'm a different color. Like you, I'm a rare color. I was born into this world... ...but I have another world of my own, unlike anyone else's. I choose life partners, intimate friends, lovers... that are like myself, Ihsan. According to you, this may be a terrible thing. But believe me, it's really a minor detail. When you think about it, we all live the same life, don't we? Our problems, our joys, sorrows... Our love, our conversations... For real? I get it, what's not to understand, bro? What is there? The world and my father have always wanted me to be someone else. The more they wished for me to be like them... the more I wanted to keep my hands in my pockets... and whistle while walking countryside roads. They wanted me to manage companies and make money... I wanted to become the summer rain and freshen things up. When they didn't want to hear the truth, I purposely... chiseled stones A to reflect the truth. I put sounds and words in them. The more I told them to look into my eyes... the more they worried about what's in between my legs. Then, when they learned the truth... they kicked me out from their world. Bro, I'm sorry, but I'd crap on a world like this. Good for you, go ahead! Leia. Leia. Come on, girl. What's going on? You've gone crazy so early in the morning. Beste, what's up with you? Let her down. I'm getting angry, finish your breakfast. Come, Leia. Leia, go eat your own food. Shall I get you one more tea? Yes, please, Beste. Dude, give me some of that milky stuff, I really like it. Come on. Should we call your mother, do you want to hear her voice? If it's not too much a bother, dude. Hello? Good morning, Mrs. Feride. We're fine, don't worry. Look, I'm putting Ihsan on the phone. Hello? How are you, mom? We're fine. We're having breakfast. I had forest fruit cereal. Okay, okay. Okay, Mom, don't worry. Beste is also here. No, mom, she's not his girlfriend, she's just a friend. Okay, mom, don't worry, we're fine. How are you? Okay, cool. Alright. Take care of yourself. I'll come back tomorrow or sometime soon, anyway. I'm sending you kisses. What is this "I'll come back tomorrow" stuff? Did you come here to stop by? I don't want to be a burden. Ihsan, come on. Don't give me a headache. Temmuz, that's it, that look. The statue should be called "Shy Ares". - Who the hell is Ares? - The mythological god of war. - War is not for me. - No, I didn't mean that... Dude, what's going on? Alright... - Now, give me that look again. - What look? Ihsan, don't you realize how handsome you really are? Truly, you have one of the most beautiful faces I've ever seen. Stop it, you are making me shy. God grant us strength. Dude, what are you doing? Dude, it will be cooler, you'll see. What did you do, bro? What color is that, red? Temmuz, what did you do to the boy's chair? - Beste, it looks ugly, doesn't it? - It looks good. - What are you writing there? - It's a surprise, don't look. What do you mean, "don't look"? What color is it? Make it blue at least. Damn it, I was trying to draw a heart. I am going to do more. I will add new parts around here. We will plant flowers and stuff. - Temmuz, where are your flip-flops? - Look in that bottom drawer there. Bro, we can plant strawberries or something. We can pick them and eat them. - What is this? - So what, I like it. Don't throw it. Are you a loser, or what? "I knew everything about you and every part of you." Like a mother that gave birth to a baby. Knowing everything there is to know... my last will and testament will be a single sentence: "Bury me face-down." - Dude. - Yeah? Shall we call my mom over tomorrow? I missed her. Sure. I'll call her now, she'll come in the morning. - Do you want me to cover you up? - No, dude, it's hot. Alright. Good night. Temmuz. Yes, Ihsan. - Thank you. - Thank you, Ihsan. Thank you. - My mom! - My mom! I completely forgot. Today, we were going to breakfast. Hello, Mom? - What happened to you? - Nothing happened. No, Mom, not you, I said it to Mrs. Feride. Who's Feride? Temmuz, what are you saying, son? Mrs. Feride is here, that's why. I'm downstairs, my dear. I'm in the car, waiting for you. Come on, come on. Oh, no, mom! I need you to come upstairs. - Welcome, mom. - Thank you. Welcome. Hi, my son. You are also welcome. What happened to your face? No, it's nothing. Mom, it's a long story. Can someone explain to me what's going on here? If possible, please. I suppose this is the secret you mentioned, Temmuz. - We should go, Ihsan. - Please, I insist. Wait a minute! Nobody is going anywhere. Who is going where? No one is going anywhere. Okay, here's what we do: Mrs. Feride, you sit here with Ihsan for two minutes. I'm going in there with my mother. Let's go, mom. While waiting here, you can make yourself a cup of coffee. While you're at it, can you make some for us too? We will have some too, wouldn't we? Sure, we would. Mom takes her coffee black; it doesn't matter much for me. Come on. Come on, come on. If you want, Mrs. Feride, take Ihsan to the kitchen with you. He knows where everything is. He can show you. Smart kid, in two days, he learned it all, faster than me. When I saw him, I said "okay, Temmuz" to myself. "This is your path. This is the riddle of your life... "...it's finding the inspiration that you lost." Thank you. Thank you. Mrs. Feride, I thought about all this. I understand that your situation is a bit difficult. In every sense. Now, I have a proposal that will benefit us all. Because... Temmuz's happiness is more important than anything else in life for me. Of course, I'm sure that you know that feeling well. Indeed, I do. Mrs. Feride, so... I needed someone to help me around the house as is. So, I would like for you to work for me as a live-in housekeeper. But believe me, this is not a favor, I really need a housekeeper. We can hire professional caregivers for Ihsan. To live with him in this house. For the first time in his life, Temmuz has taken some responsibility. How can I say... He wants to adopt Ihsan as a brother. Of course, if you also give your permission. I won't involve myself with your decision about your husband. That decision is yours. But my husband will never know of this. I'm asking you to be careful about this. Also... It's OK. Are we OK? We are OK, my fairy godmother, mom! You silly little... Please, no need, please. Mrs. Feride, I want to give you my card right now. Keep it on you, please. What do you say, Ihsan? Why didn't you answer, bro? What was with that crude attitude and spoiled brat looks? What's up? Are you offended? Will we enter into a rich and poor conversation now? Oh, for crying out loud, leave it. Get over it. No offense, but I'm going to talk. Eat up. It was rude to my mother. It was rude to your mother. This is not a situation where we are giving charity or doing a favor. If there's a better alternative, let's go do that. If this is about individuality... "You are making decisions behind my back, not asking for my opinion." Is that what this is? We did ask you. Didn't we? Why would we do something bad... Don't you understand? I've grown used to you, bro. I've grown used to you a lot. I love you as my big brother, yes. But dude, what will happen next? What will happen then? Today, everyone was very happy, very joyful. Just like in a dream. What will happen when you wake up, man? Won't you get sick of me? Of course you will, one day. I know, I'll always be a burden. Human flesh is heavy, man. Hard to carry. Don't look at how little I am. I'm the world's heaviest burden. One day, you'll say: "I wish he would just leave." Then, what happens to me? Won't I be hurt even more? Wake up. See the truth. Do you hear me? See the truth! I don't care about the truth. Their truth has hurt me. My dreams are my reality, bro. One day, everyone will wake up, buddy. Kill me. I want to die even more now. Because the more I get used to you, the more I hurt inside. "Life is so undeniably real and beautiful..." In this life, hope, love, friendship and humanity exist. While death is a blank sheet of paper. Kayra, you must collect... the pieces of your life shattered by your journey and come back. "Because everything is here. Everything." This evening. Both of us. What? Bro... Don't say anything. Hello? Beste. I need to ask you for a favor. One last favor. Look, I promise. I need a phone number. I also need to make up a good lie. I'm going to do Ihsan a huge favor. Ismail. Ismail. Wake up, come on ... It's noon, come on! - Hi. Mr. Temmuz, right? - Yes. - Mrs. Nilgun sent me. - I know, don't worry, come on in. I have a dog. She's harmless, don't worry. - No problem, I'm used to dogs. - Okay. Go ahead, meet Ihsan. I'm leaving soon anyway. Mom, the helper has arrived. Don't worry, everything is fine. I'm going to have to come over, I need to get a few things. Temmuz, your father hasn't left for work yet. He's lingering. Tell me what you want, I'll bring it. It's nothing, mom, don't worry. This confrontation was meant to happen sooner or later. Okay, bye. I swear, we are very sad. Mr. Levent from the municipality has already called you, right? Yes. The doctors gave him three months to live. It's the last wish of the poor guy. What can he do, you know? Alright. The guard will be informed, right? Well, we'll be there in the late afternoon anyways. Thank you very much, thank you. Mr. Temmuz? Stop. You animal. Did you come down from a mountain? No. You made me. Do you remember? How you said you're ashamed of me, that I was a mistake? I'm just one of the millions of your sperm. According to you, if I'm a mistake, it's your mistake. Yours. You don't even have the right to be ashamed of me. I was the first to make it to my mother's womb. I've left behind millions. I think I'm a champion. "Dad!" Though it's always windy around here, this year is different. Ismail, where have you been for so many days? - Here and there. Why, what is it? - Bayram, can you leave us please? Listen up. I want to talk to you about something. You are sober, right? Tell me, what's going on? I'll tell you only if I get to make something out of it too. Because there may be a little bit of money at the end of it. Okay, I just left, I'll be home in half an hour. If you can't park there, leave the car in the parking lot below, okay? I hear they hang out in the same circles. That's the look I expected. So, you see, he's... - How do you know? - What do you mean, "how"? How do I know what? What do you mean, dude? I hear everything. I sell some stuff to these people every single day. Good God, he asks me how I know. Forget about me. - Do you know where this guy lives? - No. But I have his phone number. He had brought a form or something. From there, I can find his address. Thank you very much, Mr. Selim. You don't need to come back at night. We'll take care of the rest. Thank you. Slowly, slowly. Bro, the plan is very simple. Listen to me. We'll go there. We'll say that he touched Ihsan. We will claim harassment. Also, we can make a nice threat about the police, okay? I swear, man, they have a ton of money. I swear. Don't you see how well he's dressed all the time? - Yes, he is. - They can't go to the police anyway. They'd be afraid if this situation were to be revealed. You see, the money is guaranteed. Once we have roughed him up a bit... we can take whatever he has in his pockets. I'm telling you... He would even give us whatever money he has in the bank. Where are you going, you slut? Where? Have you guys ganged up on me or something? Give me that phone. Let go, Ismail! - Give it to me. - Ismail, let go! Where the hell are the forms Temmuz brought? - What forms? There are no forms. - Don't lie to me. I'll turn the house upside down, and I'll find them. Where are they? Where are they? Didn't I tell you not to lie to me? Bro! Bro, enough. Enough, bro! Enough! Enough! - Here's his number. Should I call? - Bro, are you crazy? Don't you think at all? We are going to this house. I don't know, Mrs. Nilgun. He beat me up again. They left the house in a hurry. They took the address. He will do something terrible to Temmuz. Please, call him. Call him, tell him to get out of the house with Ihsan. For crying out loud, the traffic is not moving at all. Relax, bro, we are on our way. - Dude, where are we going? - To the end. As we agreed. We did not agree like this. You're not coming, I'm the only one going. - Bro, say something. - "Something". Get it, get it. - Do you think he's home? - He should be. He can't really go anywhere with Ihsan. If he's not, we will just stay here and wait. There's nothing else to do. Well... The door is open, man. Sir... If you ever go near my son, or Feride, or Ihsan again... these guns will go off. Both of you will find yourselves rotting under the ground... in a forest in the middle of nowhere. No one would ever know. Except me. I will come to spit on your corpses. Now, listen to me. I'm giving you a day to leave Istanbul. These big boys, they'll be watching your every move. Just in case you decide to try something. Bro! Hello. Mr. Levent must have told you about the situation. Yes, I'm fully informed. Alright. We will go up, and we want to be left alone if possible. That's how my friend wants it. Mr. Levent mentioned that, right? He did. Help! I have one more request. Can you please take the dog for a little walk? Go as far as possible. Okay, I'll walk her. Bro, I'm here! Bro! I'm going to give you some money. Then, I'm going to hurt you a little. Him too, of course. Then, these guys will accompany you home. And then, this event will be forgotten forever. Are we OK? Is it a deal? Bro! Dude... Dude, what are you doing? Man, say something, say anything, man! Don't be scared, trust me. Dude, dude, stop. One, two, three, four. - Bro, I beg of you. - Five. - Bro! Just me, okay, bro? - Six. Seven. Eight. I don't want anything to happen to you. Bro, please. Okay, think of your mother. Nine. - Think about Princess. - Ten. Eleven. Please, dude, I don't want anything to happen to you. No. We have started this journey together, and we will go together. - Okay! Okay, I give up! - Eighteen. Nineteen. - I broke my vow! - Twenty. We will not give up! Bro, stop! Okay, I don't want it anymore, stop, bro. No! We will not give up! We will not give up on life! Like that jerk, Sisyphus... we will not let our boulder roll back down. We will carry our boulder to the summit in one go and place it there. See, after that, it will never fall again. Thirty-three. Thirty-four. Thirty-five. Thirty-six. I know stones. I know boulders. I'm their words. I'm their voices. I have vowed not to leave you. Man, I have vowed to keep you alive. My stubbornness is true, my wings are made for you. Forty-eight. Forty-nine. Fifty. Who am I, bro? Aren't you the one who woke me up from my deep sleep? Aren't you the one who found me in my dreams, calling out to me? Am I the one saving you, or are you the one saving me? You told me that human flesh is heavy and hard to carry. Wrong. You are my wings. Come on. Come on, baby bird. Come on. Come on. To the very top, to the summit. Leave this beauty and go where? Yeah, dude. Ihsan, never forget this. Never forget it. Every day... I will remember it every day, brother. This is a happy ending. This is a happy ending because it leads to a start. Are we OK? We're OK. Come on now. Open your arms and scream out. I'm the king of the world! For My Friends
