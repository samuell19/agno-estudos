I'm sure it is. I'll tell you someday. I will. I promise. When you're first getting To know someone, And in that blissful, psychotic First flush of love, It seems like every aspect Of their personality-- Their whole demeanor, The simple lovely twist Of their ear lobes, And their marvelous Phone voice, And their soft, Dark, wet... Whatever... Is somehow imbued With an extra push of color-- An intensity heretofore, You know, unknown. You want a molson? You drink molson? Uh-huh. In your own home? I've been known to. So why can't you sleep? I want to solve this. I wasn't exaggerating. It's been since i was 14. Aha.

But-- Why not? I just don't. Your career? What career? No. I think kids are great. I just don't think it's fair To raise them in the world The way it is now. Where else are you Going to raise them? We're here. Say. Like the woman In the white hotel, People really do Struggle their whole lives Just to die in lime pits. And not just in books. Women... Go blind... From watching their children Being murdered. Not in this country, They don't. They get shot on the sidewalk In front of their houses In some drug war.

Why would you want to go Inside another person's body If you didn't know them? That's conjecture. I think i know That, peter. But wouldn't you do better To pick somebody that you knew? So then you could do, Or be, or have The things that they did, Or "beed" or had? Right. Are you rita now? Is that what you're Telling me? That you two have... Merged? All right. Have you ever-- This is sort of A bizarre question. But have you ever been having Sex with somebody... No. And they're doing Everything right-- More or less-- Oh, yeah. Thanks. I remember.

I couldn't tell my mom Or go to the cops. Who would believe me, right? They could've thrown me Into an institution Or an old folk's home. I didn't even Have our keys. I had to pretend to be him Until you figured it out. And i knew you would. I think this is like One of those dreams Where you keep telling Yourself "just hang on "and we're all Gonna wake up. We'll walk in And she'll be there and It's gonna be okay, rita." I just keep thinking There's something I'm forgetting. When he leaned in To kiss me, Something-- I-i gotta slow down. I'm sorry. That's okay. I get short Of breath. Better? What was i saying? You get short Of breath. No, before that. I'm not senile. I know. I know.

What do you mean, You're sorry? Rita's gone back To lake forest With her mother, peter. Why? I don't think it's A good idea for you to come To the house or call For awhile, Until she calms down. I went for a walk. "calms down"? We brought both cars So i could pick up Some of her things, And i'll be out Of your way momentarily. Wait a minute! Marshal! I'm sorry for Whatever personal turmoil You're going through, son. Turmoil? What did she tell you? If you want me to Refer you to someone-- Rita says That you're suffering From delusions, peter. And i should tell you That she's talking about Filing for a divorce. Or an annulment. Whichever. Oh, now-- okay. What sort of delusions Did she say I was suffering from? She says... That you're convinced She's someone else. Uh-huh. Sure. I'm sorry. I'm gonna have to Defer to her wishes. I can't believe this! You're just gonna take Her word? It's difficult for me To believe, knowing rita The way that i do, That this is about a squabble Or a tiff of some kind. You don know her! You don't know The first thing about her. That's the absurd part. You don't even know Your own flesh and blood. I'm sure you're right, Peter. Rita was a communist. Did you know that? That she was in a communist Or socialist party? Then all right. Here's something else You didn't know. We didn't go out for a year. We didn't go out For anything like a year. You only see What you wanna see. She's lying to you now, Dr. Boyle.

Two weeks ago, We had to go pick him up In lake forest. Why? Did he know Someone there? No, not that We're aware of. He doesn't always Get this way. Lately. He just takes off. Is your father Involved in any Activities that might Bring him into the city? He isn't involved In anything. We keep telling him to take An interest in life. Is your father Suffering from any Mental or neurological Disorders? He hasn't been himself Since my mother died last fall. He had to move in With us, and-- This has been Coming on for awhile. What has? I'm not saying He can't stay here. He struggled For so many years Just to make ends meet. Then when he was ready To retire, boom. We'd just gotten My mother buried. We found out he has Lung cancer a few weeks ago. He always complains, So i didn't-- I guess i didn't Take it serious, And cirrhosis he's had For years. I can't put him away. He doesn't even have A year to live. You know? If you knew the man He used to be-- He was a-a self-starter, A real fighter. I'm sorry, Mrs. Blier. I-- Oh-- I think i left the gas on In the kitchen... In the center. Well, should I call someone? No, no. I'm so embarrassed. The fire department? I apologize. I'll drive you. No. Yes. Uh, no. I have a car. It's just up the street. I'll be fine, thanks. I'll call. So what did you say? Nothing. Am i sick? No. This is me, peter. Remember? You have lung cancer And cirrhosis. She said she thought You had a year to live. Wow. The next six days Were the worst, The strangest, Of my life. We moved back and forth From room to room. We called her parents. No answer. The next day, the same. And the next. I called rita's aunt dorothy In cincinnati. She had no idea Where they were, And wanted to know Why i didn't know. I told her Rita and i had split up. Trust me. The car's gone. Mom never turns The lights out, ever. They're not here. Then why are we whispering? Some suitcases Are gone. I miss your face. How soft it was. I miss it too. Your hair was so great. Oh, come on. And your little white feet. What? You don't like these? At night i could feel The loneliness Coming off both of us Like heat. It was as if we'd been Married forever, suddenly, Without the sex. Rita and i, meanwhile, Kept up the pleasantries. The old married couple We'd become. Time's up. Rita. What? You know... If you think How we're born... And we go through All the struggle Of growing up... And learning The multiplication tables... And the name For everything. The rules. How not to get run over, Braid your hair, Pig latin. Just all the effort. Then getting a job, Probably something You don't even like doing... For not enough money, Like tending bar. And that's if you're lucky. That's if you're... Not born in calcutta... Or the u.s. Without money. Then there's your marriage, Having your own kids if-- You know. And they're going through The same struggle All over again. Only worse, because... Somebody's trying to sell them Crack in the first grade by now. And all this time, You're paying taxes, Your hair starts To fall out, And you're wearing Six pairs of glasses... Which you can never find. And you can't recognize Yourself in the mirror. And if you live long enough, You finally get to watch Everybody die. All your loved ones-- Your wife, Your husband. Your kids, maybe. And you're totally alone. And as a final reward For all this, You disappear. No one knows where. I don't want you To die, rita. I don't want me To die either. And i'm going to. So are you. But... We got to have this. I mean, What a trip... Meeting you... And being in love, Falling. It was bitchin' For awhile. And okay.
