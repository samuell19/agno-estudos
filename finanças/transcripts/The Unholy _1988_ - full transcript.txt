I detest all m... No, don't. No... no. No, no. Please. - Where do you think you're going? - I'm a priest, officer. I'm sorry, Father. Park right there. Thank you. Mrs. Baker, just relax. Just routine questions. I don't know. I didn't see him. He just jumped in front of my car! I'm a priest. Help me, Father. John Michael, you're in danger. Come on. We have to go now. I want you, John Michael. He's gonna jump if somebody doesn't talk to him soon. Yeah. You're right. Where's he at? Could have had the Pope by now. Hi. Father Michael? Thanks for coming, Father. His name is Claude. J-Just let us deal with this. You ever handle a suicide before? Come on, Father. Listen, you've... you've got to be very careful, because he's liable to jump. His? Yeah. - Father... - Stay away from the window. Claude? I'm Father Michael. You wanted to see me? It's too late. You sent for me, Claude. Listen, it's... awkward talking like this. So we can see each other. Do you have any family, Claude? They don't care. I care. Oh, don't give me that. Claude, I'm going into that room. I'm gonna clear it and sit on that bed. Why don't you come to this window so I can see your face when we talk? - No. - Hey, if you still want to jump... it's just as high from here. I'm going in now. I'll let you know when we're alone. Would you wait outside? Let's do what the father says. They've gone, Claude. Smoke? Father Michael was thrown from a 17th-story window. Then it wasn't he. I have been mistaken. We must begin again. Yes? Yes, this is Archbishop Mosely. Dr. Sulay to radiology. Dr. Sulay to radiology, please. Your Excellency. May I show you the way? The attending surgeon has been waiting to speak to you. Dr. Brill, please pick up the phone. Thank you, sister. That will be all. He's sleeping now. He will be for several hours. Will he live? His X-rays disclose no broken bones, no fractures. We did a brain scan. No indication of any damage there. In fact, so far, we haven't found any injuries whatsoever. How is this possible? Well, there have been cases of pilots parachuting from very high altitudes whose parachutes have failed to open, and somehow they survived. With no injuries whatsoever. Your Excellency. Where am I? In a hospital. I fell. Yes. But I'm not injured. The doctor says you're all right, John. He wants to make some further tests, but he finds no signs of injury. No. This isn't possible. Try to get some sleep. - Sherry? - No, thank you. The hospital is giving you a clean bill of health, John, I have good news for you, John. You've been granted your own parish... St. Agnes. Because of the fall. Your fall. Doesn't it trouble you? As a priest, you're called upon to believe Why should this be so difficult to accept? Fortunately, we were able to keep the incident out of the newspapers. The church is taking care of that. His holiness does not approve of miracles. You can take over St. Agnes immediately. Three years? Why was it closed? Father Dennis, the last pastor, was murdered there. Who did it? That's a matter for the police and for God. I'll try not to disappoint you, Your Excellency. I know you won't. God be with you. Oh, he's so young. I am certain. He is the one. Francis, stop that, you bad dog. Can I help you? Hello. I'm Father Michael. I was expecting you, but not so soon. I'm Teresa Montague, the caretaker. Hello. Is, uh, is this your dog? He's very old and sickly. Now that Father Dennis is gone, I just don't have the heart. He keeps coming in here looking for Father Dennis. He don't understand death. Well, Teresa, we have a lot of work to do if we're gonna open for business. We now anoint this altar and this building. May God in his power make them holy. Stay, Francis. Police. Lieutenant Stern, you startled me. I'm sorry I scared you, Father, They told me you weren't hurt in that fall. Hard to believe. Is that why you came here in the middle of the night? To see for yourself? I don't like unsolved cases. You're working rather late, aren't you? I'm not on duty, Father. I'm... I couldn't sleep. I... I got lots of questions and no answers. Would you like some coffee? Yeah. Thank you, Father. - It's not fresh, but it's warm. - Thanks. - You're the third priest. - What do you mean? Don't you know about Father Collins? Father Collins. Was murdered here the Saturday night before Easter Sunday The archbishop managed to keep both incidents out of the papers. We got two homicides filed "Unsolved." It's been 3 years, but, uh... How were they killed? Both the same way. and, um, their throats had been ripped out, Father Dennis did have one kind of unusual name in his appointment book. I wonder if it's still around here. Yeah. Huh. Yeah. That's it. I never got anywhere with that either. Somebody around here just hates priests. Maybe it's the way they make coffee. What happened? You sure you're in the right place? I know where I am. Millie, come over here. This is, uh... Oh! What did you and Father Dennis talk about, Millie? He wanted me to quit this scene and go back to school. And what else? I said I would. Did he offer to do that? All he offered to do was pray for me. Great. Oh, yeah. Ohh. How old are you? Nineteen. Who do you think killed him, Millie? A priest hater. Who else, Father? Ohh! Bye. ♪ He's my comfort ♪ There's a young woman here to see you. Says you know her. Millie. Show her in, Teresa. All right. You can come in now. Am I disturbing you, Father? Not at all. Have a seat. So what can I do for you? I didn't tell you all I know about Father Dennis. Will you tell me now? Just before he died, I came to him for confession. Millie, I'm a priest. You can tell me. I told him I gave myself to the Devil... to Luke. I'll serve the coffee, Teresa. Thank you. Come on, Francis. Come on. You want some? No, thanks. So how did you meet this Luke? I ran away from home.

I'm gonna tear his eyes out! ...from the mouth of the beast. Hello? Hello? Who is this? I... I can't hear you. Is this some kind of joke? I'm waiting for you in Hell. Oh, Father Michael.
