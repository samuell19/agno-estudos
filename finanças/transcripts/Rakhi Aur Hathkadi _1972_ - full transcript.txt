Lord! Lord! - Where did you get her from? - From the temple. - Her parents? - Her father was an old, blind priest over there. The poor man died. Did he die or did you... How much will you charge for her? Not charge, Pannabai. I will take rupees for her. - A total of 1000 rupees. - I will give you 300. You can't fool me, Pannabai. I will take her to Hirabai. I will give you 500 rupees. Not a penny more than that. - Give me. - Here. Count them. And remember, if you ever inquire about the girl... I will give your name to the police. Don't worry, Pannabai. I don't act in a way that might get me to the police. I hope you will recall me when this bud blooms in a flower. Mangal, charity begins at home. May God bless you, Pannabai! If you don't know how to put bangles on someone... why do you deal in bangles? Only for you. So that I can meet you and talk to you. These bangles are broken, but my hands are still empty. Just as your forehead, your hair and your life is also empty. What are you up to, Ramesh? Have you worn Janaki the bangles? You've broken so many bangles? You bring poor quality bangles these days, Ramesh. Not poor quality, they are as delicate as my heart. Just a small push, and they break down. You also get pushed, Ramesh? Don't talk too much, and wear my dear child the bangles. I am still to get her ready like a bride. Today is her show; many rich people will come. Sir, Janaki misses you very much. She's cried her eyes out. Won't you come to meet her? Sister is coming! Hide somewhere. Not here; behind the sofa. - What's this? - What? - You're again going on hunting? Sister, I am a Thakur. Will I play cricket instead of hunting? You haven't hunted down even a sparrow till now. I missed my shots till now. But today I won't. Come back early in the evening. Or your brother in law will be angry. Sister, I don't fear when you are with me. Please, convince brother in law. Come out! - Here, take these 10 rupees... - 10 rupees? Don't make noise. Give it to Pannabai... and tell her that I am coming this evening. Go! Go fast! What's this? Who's he? Sir, he might have come with a message from Pannabai. That means Vikram still goes at Pannabai's brothel. Yes, sir, he hasn't yet stopped visiting her. It should be stopped, Munimii. Go to Pannabai today and tell her that... if she allows Vikram to enter her brothel... - we won't let her live in this city. - Yes. Wow! What beauty! 'How do I come to meet you, dear? ' 'How do I come to meet you, dear? ' 'How do I get out of the house? ' 'Look! Look! Look! ' 'How do I come to meet you, dear? ' 'How do I get out of the house? ' 'Look! Look! Look! ' 'I get scared after walking a few steps' 'Look! Look! Look! ' 'In an unfamiliar street.' '... I was waiting with my drape off my head' 'In an unfamiliar street.' '... I was waiting with my drape off my head' 'My body was dancing like a flame burning all night' 'Look! Look! Look! ' 'I get scared after walking a few steps' 'Look! Look! Look! ' 'These wretched bangles speak.' '... that my beloved laughs at me' 'These wretched bangles speak.' '... that my beloved laughs at me' 'These Ghoonghroos prick my leg like thorns' 'Look! Look! Look! ' 'How do I come to meet you, dear? ' 'How do I get out of the house? ' 'Look! Look! Look! ' 'I get scared after walking a few steps' 'Look! Look! Look! ' Dear, sir, what has displeased you? You know that I've come here to hear her sing... not to get myself insulted, and that, too... by some ordinary man. This isn't an insult. This is the style of a lover. She attracts her lover with some jealousy and agony. Look, Pannabai, you know that... I've been crazy after Janaki for long. And you also know that I have the first right... over whichever new girl comes to the market. Why not, sir? But you also know that... there are millions of lovers of a prostitute. But that guy is the luckiest whom the prostitute loves. And that lucky one is you. Really, Pannabai? Then Janaki should be sent... to my bungalow near the lake tomorrow night. - She will reach there, sir. But there's one point. - What? Such a priceless flower blooms once in years. And its price is what one asks for. Got it, sir? We are ancestrally rich, Pannabai. We understand such points at once. Will thousand rupees for a month be fine? What are you saying, sir? 1000 rupees a month will only be for smelling its fragrance. What about its beauty, color, youth and style? I will take 5000 rupees for all that. Very good, Pannabai. Janaki has robbed my heart; you rob my money. I'm robbed! My place is only at your feet, Lord. I've been offering you flowers of my dignity. I won't let that dignity be robbed. Before my dignity gets robbed, take my life away, Lord. Pannabai! - Is Pannabai here? - She's inside. Tell her that Munshi Dindayal has come to meet her. Please, have a seat. I will call her out. - Pannabai! - Tell me. - I agree to all that you say. I'll leave now. I will eagerly wait for Janaki tomorrow. - Aunt Panna! - Who? Janaki? Speak! Speak! Aunt, Munshi Dindayal has come to meet you. Munimii? Why did that wretched come here? Pannabai, do something. Don't worry. Go out by the back door and I'll handle the rest. Come with me. Come. My house is graced today! How come you're here? Where is Vikramsingh? Who? Thakur Viredrasingh's brother in law? I refused him to come her... the same day you told me the orders of Thakur. Don't lie, Pannabai. Vikramsingh comes here. And he is present here at this moment. Girl, you tell me, is Vikramsingh here? Believe me, Munshiji. I've stopped him to come here for good. We singers go to Thakur's place to pay him respects. How can we dare to disobey his orders? Vikramsingh is not here. You can search my house if you want. Pannabai, I am warning you the last time. If Vikramsingh doesn't stop coming here... this brothel of yours will be shut down for good. Remember that. You! Would it have bothered you if you... had said that Vikramsingh does not come here? How could I lie? You think yourself to be sati Savitri? I've spent all my earnings to bring you up. And now when it's time to recover it, you act smart? I've already made a deal with someone for you. You will have to go to Vikramsingh tomorrow. Got it? You're so strange, Munshiji. If Vikramsingh was at Pannabai's place... why didn't you drag him back here? Don't you realize that his habit defames us? Who says that Vikram goes to Pannabai's brothel? Munshiji, do you have some enmity with my brother? What are you saying, madam? Then what will you gain by defaming him? Munshiji is just doing his duty... Munshiji said that and you believed him! That poor boy had gone for hunting since the morning. - Had gone on hunting? - Yes, I'll call him. - Vikram! - Yes, sister? What is it? What were you saying, Munshiji? He had really gone on hunting. Very good, brother in law. You're wearing clothes of hunters... but perhaps you did that in hurry, right? You're holding a shoe in hand, the button's undone... No, the button is done. - What have you killed? - Killed? Yes, you had gone hunting, right? Yes, but I had to come empty hand today, brother in law. Such a pity! You've been hunting since many days... but you've not caught a single animal till date. The thing is, brother in law, I've been after a deer for many days. I'll shoot her tomorrow. Brother, if you were a real hunter... you would know that a hunter never kills a female, but only males. Yes, yes, I know that. Well, whichever deer you kill tomorrow... I will come along to see your shot. Yes, sure, sure. But brother, that jungle is very dangerous. - That means I should not go with you. - No. - Come, Vikram. - Wait! - Do I also wait, brother in law? You can go. You can also go, Munshiji. Come. Sit. Do you still think that Munshiji is lying? Listen, Ratna, everyone loves ones own people, but not like this. Your love has spoiled him and made him a bad person. Don't know what will he be in future. - I know you don't like Vikram. - No... no... What else? If I had kids, why would he stay here? - He has everything in life. - What do you mean? You're getting defamed because of him. He will not stay here anymore. - I will tell him to go... - Wait! Wait! If you've felt bad, I won't say anything to Vikram from now on. Are you happy now? I am ready to lose anything for your happiness. Just tell him to keep in mind my prestige. That's it. - I will tell him. - Look at me and say that. I will talk to him right now. Look, Janaki, if you dare to displease Vikramsingh... I am Pannabai, got it? You've brought me up like your daughter, auntie. Please, don't ruin my life. I will serve you by singing and dancing all my life. I will survive on two pieces of bread. Stop blabbering! You should be happy that... a rich man like Vikramsingh is crazy after you. You will live like a queen. You will live luxuriously. It is better to die... than live luxuriously after selling your dignity. Shut up! Think yourself to be a decent girl? Sit here and wait for Vikramsingh. I am going, and will take you back in the morning. No, no, auntie. I beg of you; don't leave me in this hell. - I won't stay here. - How will you not stay? Let go of me. You won't stay here? Aunt Panna! Aunt Panna! - Pannabai! - Yes, sir? - You are wonderful. - Where is my darling? - She's waiting for you inside. Here, take this 5000 rupees; it's your price. And this 5000 is the salary of Janaki, in advance. Thank you very much, sir. Pannabai, you can go now. Driver! Drop Pannabai at her home. 'Without you, o darling, nothing interests me' 'Without you.' Have you locked the door from inside? Doesn't matter. I know how to come in. You helped Draupadi once when she was in trouble. You will have to protect me today. I will die, but I will not let anyone touch my body. You? What will he know, darling? Look here. A living Kanhaiya is standing in front of you. Whatever you want, ask from me, dear. - Come here. - Don't touch me! Pannabai has just taken 10 thousand rupees from me. I've bought the rights to touch you. Come and hug me. - Scoundrel! - No, lover has ever slapped me. Here, slap me again. Slap, but don't make me wait, dear. Let go of me! Leave... Help! Let me go! Let me go! Lord, help me! No... listen... no fighting... Don't hit me. Is anyone there? Get hold of him. Catch this man. Hit him hard and break his bones. Where will you escape now, dear? O God! Scream now! Call him! Ramesh! - No, I won't go. I won't go. - How won't you? She's gone! Idler! Do you pay you every month for this? Aren't you ashamed to get beaten by a poor man? Curse you! When I saw you at Pannabai's place... don't know why but I felt sympathy towards you. But after listening to your story, I am ready to help you. That's why we've come to you, Munshiji. Today I've saved Janaki from Vikram... but he won't rest till he revenges for that. He's a rich man. Don't worry about Vikram. I only want to know... whether you really love Janaki. I not only love her, Munshiji, I can give my life for her. Despite knowing that she's been brought up by Pannabai? Munshiji, river Ganga also flows through so many places. And so many dirty creeks get place in her waters. And yet its holiness is never at threat. When do you want to marry Janaki? As soon as possible. All right, you both stay at my place for tonight. I will get you married tomorrow. Munshiji? Don't worry, Pannabai. No one can dare question Vikram. I will smash that bangle man. Like this. - Munshiji? - What happened? Pannabai, we cannot get Janaki now. Let's go back. Coward! Get out of my way. This marriage cannot take place! This marriage is already done, Pannabai. If you create any nuisance, I will get you all in jail. Thakur? Why have you come here? I've come to congratulate the groom and the bride. To congratulate? I see. Come. Please, come. Bless you. May God always keep you happy! Congratulations to both of you! And to you, too, Munshiji. Vikram, what are you doing? Has anyone said you anything... that you are displeased and are leaving? Why don't you speak? What do I say, sister? If I live in this house... people say that I am at the mercy of my brother in law. That mere Munshiji is respected here, but not me. How can you be compared to Munshiji? Munshiji is our servant, but you are my brother. Listen, sister! If Munshi stays here, I will not. Why do you get upset, brother in law? - I will get him out right away, but on one condition. - What? - What's his fault? - Brother in law, his fault is... - Yes, tell me... - Speak! Why don't you tell him? - The fault is that... - I will tell you, Ratna. The thing is that the female deer he wanted to shoot... - Female deer? - Yes, Munshiji has let her run away. You're a Thakur and yet you fired on a female deer? Weren't you ashamed? If you must shoot, couldn't you shoot a lion or a cheetah? Sure! Sure! But, brother in law... Your secret will be disclosed. Better take out your clothes from this bag... and put them back in the wardrobe. - What are you staring at? Take it. - Go. - How innocent he is, isn't he? - Yes. Thank God I have only one brother in law. If I had two, what might happen to me? Come. - Give. - Eat fast while the food is hot. You also sit here. I can't eat a bite without you. - Is Ramesh home? - I'll see who's come. - Munshiji? Please, come. - How are you, sister? - Greetings. - Greetings. - Please, have something. I am fasting today. You carry on. - Please sit. - Today I was passing by this street... so I thought I might as well meet you both. I hope Vikram or Pannabai are not troubling you. - Not till now. - Good. Sometimes we wonder, how will we repay this favor of yours? Someday... Ramesh, what's the matter? - Why are you holding your stomach? - Nothing. Munshiji, he gets such stomachaches many times. It pains him, but he does not care to visit a doctor. It's not good to be so careless about health. Promise me in front of Munshiji that you'll go to a doctor. Hold him... lift him. Let's take him to the bed. I will call the doctor. Don't worry. I will call the doctor, right away. - Thakur! - Doctor, I hope there's nothing to worry about. It's not a matter to worry, but to be happy. You mean? That means whether you have a boy or a girl... don't forget to send me the sweets. Boy or... what are you saying, doctor? - Is Ratna going to be a mother? - Yes. - Really, doctor? - Yes. - Keep lying, Ratna. - Congratulations. God has granted your wish after many years. - Yes. - Have patience, dear. I'll be off now. - Ok. Doctor, I didn't expect it. So many years after our wedding... Ratna, did you hear what the doctor said? It has been 15 years to our marriage. We had lost hope of having a baby. - God never lets anyone down. - Yes. - He has heard our prayers after all. - Congratulations! Congratulations, sister. Congratulations, brother. - I am also going to be a Mama. - Mama? Didn't get it? Double Ma, that is Mama (maternal uncle). Don't sit, brother in law. Let us be alone on this occasion of joy. Got it. So that you can have a romantic chat? Yes, that's it. Close the door. What's the matter, sir? Why do you look so tensed? What do I tell you, Munshiji. She was unconscious when she gave birth... and the baby was born dead. Doctor said that Ratna is in a critical state. I fear I might lose her. Don't say that, sir. I've given her the medicine. She'll regain consciousness by 8 or 9 o'clock. But take care, Thakur, that you don't tell her... about the baby till she is conscious. But we will have to tell her, doctor. That might put her life to danger. We will have to hide this matter from her... till she is completely all right. It's not that easy, doctor. Ratna became a mother... after 15 years, and that, too, of a dead child. What will we answer when she asks? Don't be tensed, Thakur. Come with me, please. Ratna! - Are you feeling better now? - Yes. Try to sleep. What happened, Ratna? My baby... where is the child? The child is with the nurse in the other room. - Did you see him? - Yes, I did. He's beautiful, healthy... - Bring him to me. - Yes. - Go... go... - The child might be asleep now... or the nurse would have brought him here. And the doctor has said that you need rest. See the child tomorrow morning. No, I will see him now. Ratna, what's the hurry? See him later. You won't get it. I can't rest till I see him. Please, bring him. Why don't you go? I will neither go nor bring the child. Doctor has said that you are ill and need rest. Ok, I will talk to the nurse myself. What are you doing? Are you crazy? Let go of me! There surely is something... because of which you don't want to show me the child. - No, it's not that, Ratna. - I will see the child right now. I will hug him and love him. Please, for God's sake, show me my child. How do I show you the child? Actually the matter is... Actually the matter is, madam... that you are ill, and that's why sir refused to bring the child. This is the matter, Ratna - If you want to see the child, you surely can. Nurse, bring the child. Here. Ratna, give the child to the nurse and lie down. No, let me hold him for some more time. Let her, sir. Come. Munshiji, I will give... as much money as required for his treatment. Go and give her the money tomorrow. And tell her that Ratna should never know of that. - Don't worry, sir... - Vikram is coming here. Brother in law, forgive me. The tyre of my car got punctured... when I was returning from a hunt. That's why I am late. I should have been here earlier at such an occasion. Good that you came late. Right, Munshiji? - Why? - You won't get it. - I won't get it? Anyways, tell me whether she had a boy or a girl? Better find it out yourself. Sometimes you crack such jokes; I really enjoy them. No, no, Munshiji. We haven't sold our child. One day you did a big favor to us. Janaki, any big favor can be valued, but not yours. I am giving you this money because... no illness can be treated without money these days. Ramesh is ill; it is necessary that he recovers. Get him treated so that he can recover fast. Even if I do recover, how will I forget... that I increased my life by losing by son? Don't be silly! You both are still very young. If God wishes, you can have 10 sons. Janaki, I got you married. So it is my duty to take care of your husband. Look, Janaki, if you ever need anything, just let me know. Do you remember, Janaki, I had told you... on the 1st night of our marriage that... I am not worth being your husband? I controlled my tears when I lost my child. - Do you want me to cry again? - No, Janaki, no. A good child is his parents' support. Our child proved that as soon as he was born, didn't he? Yes. Yes, put it over there. Munshiji, some one has come to meet you. I've made her sit in that room. Yes, I'll go and see. You guys continue with your work. Viru, see that they work properly. I'll be right back. Come on. Who? Janaki? You? How come you're here? I am leaving by next morning's train... with Ramesh, to get him operated. I want to see my child once before I leave. What are you saying, Janaki? Just think, if anyone sees you... in this house, it would be terrible. You shouldn't have come here. I tried to convince and stop myself, but couldn't stop my heart. Once... if I could hug him just once... I will go away for good then. I understand your restlessness, but can't do any thing. I can neither take you in, nor bring the child out. Forget him, Janaki. Now he is not your son. - Nor is there a way to meet him. - There is one way. Today is his naming ceremony. I had abandoned dancing to gain my husband. I will dance again to see my son, Munshiji. Janaki! Let me sing on this ceremony, Munshiji. I will never forget this favor of yours. All right, Janaki. Go now, and come back in the evening. 'Blessings to your son' 'Blessings to your son' 'Swings on the swing of my heart' 'Blessings to your son' 'Swings on the swing of my heart' 'Your son.' 'Your son.' 'Swings on the swing of my heart' 'With small legs he falls and stands up again' 'May the sun always bright his future' 'The sky will bow down and kiss him' 'The sky will bow down and kiss him' 'In this courtyard' 'Your... your... your son.' 'Swings on the swing of my heart' 'Your son.' 'Swings on the swing of my heart' 'Your son.' 'Swings on the swing of my heart' What is this, brother in law? You're giving your son in the hands of a prostitute? Stop blabbering! And what's wrong even if I give her? - She will only love her. - Never! Vikram is right. A prostitute cannot love my child. Forgive me. I had forgotten my identity for a while. 'Like a naughty moon swinging in the pram' 'Don't look at him too much, or his complexion will be dirtied' 'Take my drape.' 'Take my drape.' 'And put him in it' 'Your... your... your son.' 'Swings on the swing of my heart' 'Everyone can give away money and diamonds' 'I have only brought good wishes for him' 'May he get my life! ' 'May he get my life! ' 'May you live long! ' 'Your... your... your son.' 'Swings on the swing of my heart' Please, give this prize money in charity after your son's name. May God always protect him! May all my well wishes fall on him like a mother's milk! You've fallen back to your old status. If you wanted to live a decent life only for few months... I could have done that for you. Where are you going? You refused me for a poor man? - Get out of my way. - Ok. But remember, Janaki I will ruin your life. Janaki, sir Thakur has come to meet you. Janaki, I regret for what happened yesterday. You had done us a big favor by giving away your child. But yesterday you made us your slave... by keeping quiet at the ceremony. - Sir Thakur... I... - I don't know what do I say to you, Janaki. You strangled your motherly love... but didn't let our prestige be blotted. Don't embarrass me, sir. Now he is your son. That's what I've come to tell you. Don't worry about your son's future. He will live like a prince in our house, and will lack nothing. He will be called our son, but we will try... that he acquires virtues like yours, and becomes like you. Munshiji! Here! There are some photos of your son in this album. Munshiji will keep you... informed about your son regularly. That will be enough for me, sir. We cannot repay your favor, but God will repay it. Your husband will get well very soon. You will recover. Greetings, sir. Come, sir. Ratna, kiss him. Go child, and play outside. What's the matter? You look very happy today. - I won an old case today. - Really? Our son is so lucky. Since the day he was born, everything goes well. - Not at all! - What? Every thing is not going well; it is going very well. Are you making these socks for Suraj? Aren't they a bit small? They're not for Suraj, but for Chand. - Who's Chand? - Suraj should be having a younger brother. He should be having or is he going to have a bro? I see. That's why you look prettier everyday. - Pretty! Prettier... - Brother in law! Come, come, dear. Come in now that you are already here. Brother, Munshiji has come to meet you. That's fine, but we really disliked you... coming here at this moment. How would I know you would be romancing... Greetings, sir. Greetings, Munshiji. Sit down. Did you meet Ramesh and Janaki? How are they? No, I couldn't find them. Don't know where they've gone. What does that mean? I could only find out that... Ramesh got operated successfully and recovered. And after that he also found a good job. That's good news, but why did they do this? They didn't even inform us. That's for the better, sir. Now this secret of the child will be buried. That's true, but I wanted to be of help to Janaki all her life. Looks like they broke relation with us on purpose. That's possible, sir. But, Munshiji, I will never forget her decency. Nor will I let her child feel any shortage in life. Janaki, the more you recall the child... the more you will find it difficult to forget him. Look here. Why these tears in your eyes? You used to encourage me. How come your heart has fallen so weak? With God's grace we've got everything. I have recovered; we have a house and a business. Your faith on God will make you a mother once again. Rather than recalling Suraj and crying... pray to God that he makes him happy. And make him a successful person. He might not be called our child. But may he make his guardian parents feel proud! Close this album for ever, Janaki. Close it. You seem to be in a hurry, bro. Where are you going? Why haven't you gone to the college? I will go, but where are you going? I... I am going to the office. - Suraj! - Yes, father. - Where is Suraj? - Brother has left for the office. - So early? Well, give this letter to Dr. Gupta on your way to college. And listen! Go to some barber and... Yes, yes, I will get them cut when I return. How can you come in so shamelessly? Father is home. Doesn't matter; let him be at home. - What? - Yes. And he also knows that you come here everyday to meet me. - That's even better. - What? - Yes. How come you're not scared to hear father's name today? I saw Munshiji going out and so I hid. He went and so I came. I see. So that's the case? Ok, tell me, how long will you keep meeting me secretly like this? You joined your father's business after completing studies. This is my final year. Don't know when will I get to see that day... when you'll come to meet my father... and talk to him about our marriage. - Tell me. - It's very simple, Shobhana. According to the rule of our family... a proposal will be sent to your family. Then a priest will be sent for. Then... Then the priest will come. Find an auspicious day... and then I will be marrying someone else. - If that happens, I will feel very sad. - Only sad? - Yes. I don't understand why I love you. - It's because I love you. - Father! - We'll be in trouble. - Why has he come back? - Don't know. - Greetings, Munshiji. - Bless you, child. Have you come on some errand? Yes... I was going to the office so I thought I will take you along. Shobhana told me that you had already left... but here you come back. Let's go to the office. You go on; I will come after some time. Father, I am going to the college. Fine; I'm going to the office; I will drop you at the college. With God's blessings your wish is fulfilled today. I have got your Kiran admitted in a college. Raja, here comes your Kiran. Wow! I've been waiting for this meeting for long. You have never looked at me with a smile... ever since you've come to this college. Answer to me with your sweet voice, and not with this cycle bell. I've heard that your voice is like lovely bells. Get the signal, Raja. This is just the cycle bell. I hope you don't get thrashed. One does not get thrashed after meeting such a pretty girl. One hears the wedding bells ringing. Shall I arrange for that? I won't let you go without hearing the answer. - Right now? - Of course. Have you got your answer? Remember, my name is Kiran. - Listen! - Yes? You're going home alone. If you don't mind, can I drop you home? - Who are you? - My name is Prakash. It wasn't wise of you to mess with Raja. They are planning to revenge on you this evening. Mr. Prakash, I can take care of my self. By the way, thank you very much. Prakash, you were talking to the girl who can thrash any one. Are you in your senses? What's wrong with him? Raja, the chain's down. Let's fix it, dear. Come. Do you want help, Ms. Kiran? Help? That, too, from a loafer like you? Kiran! I haven't forgotten my insult yet. You shouldn't forget either. By the way, I don't want to bother my hands again. I had thought that I'd forgive you if you'd ask forgiveness. But looks like I will have to teach you a lesson. Oh! So you've come with these guys to teach a lesson? Teach me. But first tell me, which lesson? A lesson that you will remember all your life. Catch her! Girls! Start! Wait! Looks like they're thrashing in wholesale! Help! Stop! Where are you running? Raja has got a good smashing today. Sister, forgive me. Let him go. His team has run away from the field. He's already got a good smashing. Let us give him a chance. Ok, we'll recover in the next match. Get up, and disappear! Mr. Raja, shall I help you? - Shut up! - Go! You should be ashamed, Raja. You act like a loafer instead of a college student. You've broken the discipline of the college... and acted like an uncultured person. I tried to make you understand... I advised you and even warned you, but all in vain. Sir, I say again that Ms. Kiran has accused me falsely. I had not come to the college yesterday. You can ask them. Really, sir, Raja was ill yesterday. Yes, sir, we didn't go home last night. Sir, I'm still ill. I've come to ask for leave from you. Ask me, sir; I will tell you the truth. First of all Raja teased Kiran. He harassed her. And when she was going back home, all of them surrounded her. If the girls of the college hockey team had not... been there, don't know what might have happened. I've seen all that myself, sir. You can call on the whole team and ask them. I don't need to ask anyone after hearing your statement. Raja, we are now convinced that you will not improve. Boys like you defame the college, city and country. I am giving you the last chance. Ask forgiveness from Kiran. I won't ask forgiveness, sir. If you don't, I will rusticate you. You can, sir. I don't care. - Hallo. - Hallo. - Listen! - Yes? You warned me yesterday, and today you stood on my side. You've done me two favors. I will repay them as soon as I get a chance. - You can repay now if you want. - How? Look, for favor number one... stop calling me with respect one has for elders. We study in the same college. Your name is Kiran, and mine is Prakash. Done. And for the second favor? - For that you will have to come with me. - Where? On a picnic. Some girls and boys have arranged a picnic. - Will you come? - Yes, yes, she will surely come. I've talked to some of my girl friends. You can also bring your friends along. But not those hockey girls, please. You didn't answer me, Kiran. Now I will have to agree to you. It will be better to repay your favor as soon as possible. What time are we going? Be ready at 7 a.m. We will pick you up from your home. - Ok? Done? - Done. One thing is assured, Prakash. Kiran will never smash you now. Because she's said 'Done' to you. You're going fast, dear! It took you just a leap from 'thank you' to 'picnic'. - Now you are to take me further. - Me? How? Look, bring the boys and girls on the picnic spot late. Late? Got it. You both are burning in the same fire. Don't know about her. But I am really burning. I wish I could get a chance to talk to Kiran in privacy. - Where are the others? - Who others? The boys and the girls. We've come here on a picnic, haven't we? Y... yes, yes, they must be coming soon. - I hope they know this place. - Yes, they all know it. By the way, how did you find this place? Very good. The climate is good... and this lonely place... I am also with you. What else would you want? That's what you wanted, right? That you would get a chance... - to talk nice things to me in privacy. - What? Speak, dear. Don't feel shy. Now that you've brought me here with the excuse of picnic... speak up whatever is in your heart. - Is there a need to say? - Shut up! - I thought you were not like other guys. - Kiran! Keep quiet! I will complain about you to the principal. And will meet your parents and tell them that... you took me to a jungle in the name of picnic and teased me. What do you think me to be? Oh! Is that so? 'Dear, it is not good to tease a restless heart' 'Why do you cry? I had teased you with love' 'Someone will lose his life in this game' 'Why do you cry? I had teased you with love' 'Dear, it is not good to tease a restless heart' 'Why care for heart or life in this game of love? ' 'Dear, it is not good to tease a restless heart' 'If you say so, my dear, let it be so' 'That it is the fault of this youth and not yours' 'If you say so, my dear, let it be so' 'That it is the fault of this youth and not yours' 'When you meet me with love, you play mischief' 'Why do you cry? I had teased you with love' 'Dear, it is not good to tease a restless heart' 'Why care for heart or life in this game of love? ' 'Dear, it is not good to tease a restless heart' 'Whether I tease you or not, you don't like it either way' 'Looks like you've gone crazy from today, dear' 'Whether I tease you or not, you don't like it either way' 'Looks like you've gone crazy from today, dear' 'You are unable to brace yourself' 'Dear, it is not good to tease a restless heart' 'Why care for heart or life in this game of love? ' 'Someone will lose his life in this game' 'Why care for heart or life in this game of love? ' There's only one problem with this agreement. This figure does not match our expenses. - Greetings, sir. - Greetings, Munshiji. Come. What are these flowers for? You've forgotten as usual that today is your birthday. See, Suraj? Whether I celebrate my birthday or not... Munshiji never forgets to bring flowers for me. - Thank you. - Greetings, uncle. You don't come so often to our place nowadays. Uncle, it's my last year of studies... And you want to gain 1st rank as usual, right? Vikram, go and tell your sister to sweeten Munshiji's mouth. What a bad era! It is the birthday of a big Thakur... and you expect me to just sweeten everyone's mouth? There should be a grand party today. Father does not believe in these things, uncle. It is a waste of money. I don't understand... how you were born in this Thakur family, nephew. The grandeur or the rich people lies... in wasting money, not gathering it. Just as I wasted. People till date talk about my kindness. Yes, of course. And it is me who pays for... your kindness on the first date of every month. It is your duty, brother. If I lose my prestige, you will lose, too. Yes, dear, there's a saying... let everything be on one side, and let wife's brother be on the other. Munshiji, come to the office. I have some work with you. Sit, child. I'll be back in a while. Elder nephew, I wanted to talk something important to you. Talk to me next month, uncle. You've already talked this month. - Listen! I want some books. - Yes, let's go upstairs. Dear me! - Tell me which book you want. - Not among these. I want the book which the priests use... to find out the auspicious marriage date. I've given a few hints to my father about that. What have you done? I haven't yet got a chance to talk to father. If you can't tell him, write him a letter. I will post it. Don't joke, Shobhana. It is a serious matter. After all it is a matter of our wedding. You can't talk to your father. You're scared of talking to my father. - Do you know what will be the result of that? - What? I will be married to someone else... and you will just keep watching. Don't say such inauspicious words, Shobhana. Think of a way to talk to father. I will tell you the way, brother. - Greetings, Bhabhi. - What? You called Shobhana Bhabhi? If I knew this earlier, I would be calling her Bhabhi since long back. You proved to be really secretive, brother. Prakash, I don't like such jokes. What are you saying, brother? It's a matter of life and death for both of us. I mean for the two of us. For you because you can't talk to father. And for me because if I don't make Shobhana my Bhabhi... my being born as your younger bro would be useless. Prakash, will you stop this blabbering? Brother, you will understand it when you will go to talk to dad. But won't be able to say any thing. That day your obedient brother like Laxman... and this tape recorder will prove useful. Listen! You also listen. I want the book which the priests use... to find out the auspicious marriage date. I've given a few hints to my father about that. - What have you done? - Listen; it's your voice. I haven't yet got a chance to talk to father. - This one is yours. - If you can't tell him, write him... Younger brother in law, promise me that... if not needed, you will not let anyone hear this tape. I swear on you, Bhabhi... as soon as brother gets married, I will give it to him. So that you both can recall old memories with your kids. - Will you now go or not? - Yes, yes, I am going. But I give you a time limit of one week, bro. If you don't talk to father within this week... I will have to act like your elder bro then. Move now. Bye, brother. Bye, Bhabhi. - Wicked! - He's very naughty. Shashi, do you want to give any message to aunt Sarla? Kiran, get me some money from mother... and tell her that I pay much attention to my studies. You're paying attention? Movies in the morning, and comics at night. I am going to tell her that, and I won't get you any money. - Parkar, what are you doing? - Parkar is following my orders. And my order is that... you will go only after attending the function. Mr. Chandraprakash... - is the table man of this function committee. - Hey! I mean the he is the chairman. So it is the duty of ours, his friends, to follow his orders. - I bow down and accept this order. - Good. - But I have a request. - It will be heard. It will be heard. There are still 15 days to the function. I will meet my mother and come back immediately. Grant me the permission to meet my mother. It will surely be granted. But you will come straight to me after meeting mother. - I surely will. - Parkar! - Yes, guru. - Let her bag be given back to her. - Sure. - Let the lady be dropped at the station. - Sure, sir. - Thank you. - Come. Janaki! You've been working since the afternoon. Got a bigger load, sister Sarla. You got a bigger load, or did you purposely take it? You know, sister Sarla, how much money... your Shashi needs every month. If I don't work, how will I be able to pay for Kiran's study fees? My Shashi spends only on studies. But your Kiran lives like a princess over there. To put up a false prestige, you sold your jewelry... and mortgaged this house. Take my advice and tell Kiran the true state of affairs. No, sister Sarla. Her father never let her feel short of anything till he was alive. And neither do I want her to know my troubles. And get distracted from her studies. She's studied enough, Janaki. If a boy had born to you instead of Kiran... he would have earned some money for you. And would have been the support of your old age. Let Kiran come this time. I will tell her the truth. For God's sake, don't do that. She'll feel bad. There aren't many days left to the completion of her studies. Till then your bones will be broken, Janaki. Let my bones break, sister. Let anything happen. Kiran's father wished that Kiran would study a lot. He had many dreams for his child. I don't want to be embarrassed in front of his soul. May God give you strength! Come with me and eat some thing. Don't cook anything now. You've ruined your health by working at nights. Come. But, Prakash, 2000 rupees is too much. Why don't you get it? - Yes, that is too much. - Ok, give me 10 notes of 100 rupees then. - That should be fine. Look, I am the chairman of the function committee. You be the chairman of the funds committee. I don't want to be that. Talk to Suraj; he handles the business. I've already talked to brother. He says he won't give me more than 100 rupees. That's a waste of money. If Suraj has said 100, you will get only 100 rupees. What are you saying, father? You are a big Thakur; I am your son. All my friends have come. What will they think of us? - Greetings. - Here, Kiran has also come. - Greetings. - Greetings. I feel I've seen this girl somewhere. I don't recall. How can you have seen her, dad? - She's come at our house for the first time. - I see. Father, the fund? Yes, I will talk to Suraj. But you won't get more than 1000. Uncle, we had written only 1000 over here... - So you were fooling me? - Look, father, you've promised. A promise is a promise. - You've also promised... - Daddy, not in front of every one. - That's the modern style. - Is that a modern style? Ok, take an appointment of a barber. One thousand. Very good, Kiran. You've come one day earlier. Come; let's sit and discuss about the function. Prakash, I had come to tell you that... What's the matter? Why do you look so tensed? No, it's not that. I won't be able to participate in the function. - Look now; don't joke. - I am not kidding. I am telling the truth. She is telling the truth, Prakash. - Is there a telephone? - Telephone? What for? - I want to call at the hospital. - Hospital? What happened? If she won't participate in the function... we will get thrashed on that day. Why not book a bed in advance? Shall I, miss? Please! Why do you want to put us in trouble? Please, agree. Did you hear that? Ms. Kiran, you are a great artist. Now don't force us to flatter you more. Let's start the rehearsals. - 'What are you? - Yes, tell me' 'You are my shadow' 'What are you? You are my shadow' 'I've got such beauty' 'I taught the crazy boys what love is' 'What are you? You are my shadow' - 'What are you? - Yes, tell me' 'You are my shadow' 'What are you? You are my shadow' 'I've got such a heart' 'I taught the pretty girls what love is' 'What are you? You are my shadow' 'My delicate hands will be your support in grief' - 'The life brightens up with my fair face. - Got it? ' 'My delicate hands will be your support in grief' 'The life brightens up with my fair face' 'I've lighted the lamp of each heart' 'I taught the crazy boys what love is' 'What are you? You are my shadow' 'I've got such a heart' 'I taught the pretty girls what love is' 'What are you? You are my shadow' 'My tears make the pearl necklace in your neck' - 'If I sigh, your eyes will weep. - Got it? ' 'My tears make the pearl necklace in your neck' 'If I sigh, your eyes will weep' 'It is me who has cheered up the magic of each beauty' 'I taught the pretty girls what love is' 'What are you? You are my shadow' 'I've got such beauty' 'I taught the crazy boys what love is' 'What are you? You are my shadow' 'What are you? You are my shadow' - Excellent! Excellent performance, Kiran. - Thank you. I want you to have tea with me tomorrow evening. - But I... - Please, don't refuse. If you insist with so much love, I will surely come. - Here's the address. - Come. Eat, dear. Why are you looking at me? I've cooked them with much love. That's why I am looking at the one who cooked. Really, Ratna, it's been 40 years to our marriage. But neither yours nor my love has faded. You still look like a bride. That's why I tell you not to look without the specs on. You're caged in my eyes. Why do I need the specs? Here. There's no difference. No difference. You've grown old, and our kids have grown up. They might have grown up. Does that mean that we are old? Ok, have this. - Father! - Come, Suraj. Sit down. Have the Snacks. Your mother cooked them for me, but you can have them. Father, I want to tell you something important. Yes, child, is it regarding the business? - No, more important than that. - Go on, tell us. I've been wanting to say this for many days, but couldn't. What does that mean? Tell him to speak. - What's the matter, son? - I'll tell you. There's only one matter, nephew... that one hesitates to tell to the parents. - Looks like you're in love. - Really, Suraj? - What are you saying, uncle. - What's the matter, Suraj? - I'll tell you later, father. - Wait, Suraj, listen. - Will talk to you later. - Listen! He's feeling shy and went away. Didn't even speak to us. I will tell you, father. Why would I say either? Listen for yourself. Not among these. I want the book which the priests use... to find out the auspicious marriage date. I find this voice very familiar, but can't recognize it. - No. - She is Shobhna. Munshi's daughter. I haven't yet got a chance to talk to father. - Is that Suraj's voice? - Yes. - Stop it. Did you get it, Ratna? Suraj had come to talk about marrying Shobhana. But felt shy and went away. - You're enjoying this? - Yes... - Mom, they both want to marry each other. - Keep quiet! Why? Do you object to this relation? Yes, I do. Munshiji is our servant. And his daughter cannot be our daughter in law. You're strange, Ratna. - I've never considered Munshiji a servant, but a friend. - But... It is your greatness, sister and brother in law. - The world believes in only what it sees. - You mean? To the world you are the master and Munshiji your servant. The times of master and servant has passed, uncle. Now are the days of equality, right? Why discuss on this matter? We cannot tie relation with someone lower in status to us. I will choose the daughter in law of this family. - Come, Vikram. - Coming, sis. Forgive me, brother in law. You've never respected any of my ideas till now. But do think over what sister has said. Right, younger nephew? What are you thinking, Prakash? What if elder brother knows of this, father? Don't worry. Go and tell your brother... that I will talk to Munshiji tomorrow. Brother in law takes Munshiji as his friend. And Munshiji takes brother in law as his prey. This is the signal of danger. You made it clear in front of everyone... that you will choose your daughter in law. But brother will convince you somehow... and that daughter of Munshiji will become your daughter in law. Only God can save this house now. What nonsense you keep talking! You always find my ideas nonsense. And that Munshi who keeps calling you 'Madam'... you and brother in law don't know how cunning he is. He has trapped Suraj through his daughter. Now he will become your relative. Munshiji has forgotten his standing. And he will get insulted for this mistake. Dinu! Come here. Cut off the leaves that are falling outside the fence. - Come, come, Munshiji. You're late. - Greetings, sir. Greetings. Go and tell madam that Munshiji is here. Munshiji, I want to discuss something with you. Anything special, sir? I think we should get Suraj married now. He has already chosen the girl. Then why wait, sir? Get them married soon. The girl who will marry Suraj will be very lucky. That means, Munshiji... listen carefully... that if we propose to the girl's family, they won't mind. - The girl's family might mind, sir. - About what? If they come to know that Suraj is Janaki's son, they might mind. You've put me in confusion, Munshiji. There's no confusion, sir. The world knows that Suraj is your son. So he should get a girl from a high status and rich family. Munshiji, do you also believe in status and rich family? The times have changed... but we still have to follow it in the matters of marriage. Did you hear that? Munshiji is talking sense. Please, make him understand. To him the wish of a boy and girl... are more important than the prestige of a family. One cannot sacrifice the prestige of the family... for the silly wishes of kids. What are you thinking, sir? I am thinking that what will I tell Suraj. Don't worry about Suraj. He is my son and he will have to agree to what I say. Come, Kiran. Perhaps you'd be surprised to hear this. I am stepping in this dance hall after 3 years. I was the owner of this hotel and also a cabaret dancer. People from near and far came to this hotel to watch my dance. I had been fond of dancing since my childhood. When I used to come on stage... the hall would be filled with the sound of claps. I would feel that the whole world is welcoming me. And I would dance out of uncontrollable joy. Ladies and Gentlemen... today I will present a novel item in front of you. 'Come, come, my dear love' 'Dear, this night, and also my words.' '... are only for you' 'Come, come, my dear love' 'Dear, this night, and also my words.' '... are only for you' 'Come. You and I will be somewhere else then' 'These few moments are nothing, but they are enough' 'Come. You and I will be somewhere else then' 'These few moments are nothing, but they are enough' 'My love is restless. You are also waiting' 'You and I have only this evening' 'Come, come, my dear love' 'Dear, this night, and also my words.' '... are only for you' 'How come you don't recognize me? ' 'The drink we drank together last night.' 'How come you don't recognize me? ' 'The drink we drank together last night.' 'That glass, my dear, still has the sign of my lips' 'See you are still holding that glass' 'Come, come, my dear love' 'Dear, this night, and also my words.' '... are only for you' Hey! She's fallen down! My leg was broken. From then onwards I could not dance. Dance was my life. My life was taken away from me, Kiran. I recall those old days today as I stand in this hall. Forget those old days. You are a born artist, Kiran. I want you to dance here. I dance here? In this hotel? Why? Does art fade away if one dances in a hotel? The world does not consider it a decent thing. Whatever the people think... an artist considers his art as his worship. And wherever you worship, that place becomes a temple. But I cannot dance in this hotel. My mother is poor, but she will never like... people saying bad words about her or her daughter. Kiran, I've danced in hotel all my life. But no one has ever said anything bad about me till now. By showing one's art, one gains prestige, fame and money. You had said that your mother is poor. You can serve your mother with your art. And also serve the art itself. Tell Kiran the true state of affairs. I do not want her to know my troubles. And get distracted from her studies. She's studied enough, Janaki. If a boy had born to you instead of Kiran... he would have earned some money for you. And would have been the support of your old age. - What are you thinking, Kiran? - Well... - What have you decided? - I will dance in your hotel. Thank you, Kiran. You've given me a new life. I will arrange such a grand program for you... that everyone will be amazed. Brother! Why are you standing in the dark like that? Now the life of both of us is going to be lighted by love. This tape recorder had recorded the voice of your heart. Now listen the voice of my heart. - I will tell you the girl's name later. - Let it be, Prakash. Erase mine and Shobhana's voice from it for good. - Brother! - Never... never again play this game of voices. Father, you were going... to talk to Munshiji about brother's marriage. Yes, but what Munshiji said was right. I wanted Shobhana to be my daughter in law. That she would marry Suraj, but... And yet you agreed to mother? I would have convinced Ratna any time. She's a mother after all. She would have forgotten... this gap of high and low status within a few days. - But regretfully, Munshiji minds this relationship. - Munshiji? - Yes, he refused to it. - I see. And after his denial it was no use taking this matter further. Listen, child, tell Suraj that I could not fulfill his wish. Not every love story ends successfully, Shobhana. It would be better for us to forget each other. Will we be able to forget? What can I do? I will have to accept my mother's wish. Brother, you should have also loved after asking mother. This is cowardice! To give up one's love for mother's wish... is not cowardice, Prakash; it is sacrifice. It is Munshiji who refused, not mother. This is an accusation on my father. He was insulted by being called a servant. And that's why he refused to save his dignity. And you took that as a code of law? Come with me; I'll get you both married. Mother will have to bless you then. Mother will never give us her blessings, Prakash. You don't know what she has told me. I can never hurt the feelings of my mother. You cannot hurt mother, but you can break her heart? Why do you quarrel with him, Prakash? He cannot hurt his mother. I cannot bear my father being insulted. Let us bear what's written in our destiny. All right, Shobhana. No one can stop those who want to die. God bless you! Prakash, whose car did Kiran go in? Don't know. Let's check. Prakash, this is the car. Yes, this is the car, but where is Kiran? Let's go in and check. 'Come, come, my dear love' 'Dear, this night, and also my words.' '... are only for you' 'You are a coward. Why wouldn't I say it? ' 'Look at me. My heart is damp and yet I smile' 'You are a coward. Why wouldn't I say it? ' 'Look at me. My heart is damp and yet I smile' 'Whatever you say today, dear' 'This is popular news that I have your love today' 'Come, come, my dear love' 'Dear, this night, and also my words.' '... are only for you' - Driver! - Yes? Do you know where is the girl you brought in this car? - In room number 17, with Mr. Reen. - Mr. Reen? Some work. - Yes. You have some work with her? Yes, I want to meet her. - Ok. - Here's your prize for today. - Thank you. - Go down; my car will drop you home, ok? - Yes. - Prakash? - Why do you look scared? Because I've come here suddenly... and have seen your true face? - Prakash! - I didn't know you would stoop so low. - Is this your price for one evening? - Shut up! You should be ashamed to talk such things about me. You love me, and yet you insult your love this way? What does coming here and this money mean then? I had come here to dance, and this money is my payment for that. But why did you need to dance in a hotel? - I have some problems. - Why didn't you tell me of them? I didn't want to tell anyone. But looks like your suspicion... would not be cleared without telling you. The last time I went home, I came to know that... how much trouble my mother is going through to make me study. She is bearing much pain for me. I came back without meeting her. When I was returning I decided that I will quit studies. I will work and help my mother. I met Mrs. Reen in the function. She offered me to dance here, which I could not refuse. I thought I will be able to continue my studies... and will also help lessen the burden on my mother. But you doubted me... told me bad words. Go from here! I've done a big mistake, Kiran. Punish me as you like, but please, forgive me. I love you more than my life. I swear on you that I will never again doubt you. Please, one more chance. Forgive me. - I forgive you. - Thank you. Now tell me what can I do for you. Not now. First learn to be independent. Then I will give away all my worries to you. And rest carefree. Come. Mr. Reen's driver must be waiting for me. No, you won't go in Mr. Reen's car. You will go in my car. - Not again. - I am not forcing you; I am requesting you. All right. Come. Janaki, is there a letter from Kiran? No, it's a money order. - And see, she's sent me 200 rupees. - Really! - Yes. Listen to what she writes. Mother, I felt very bored after the study time. So I give tuition to two kids in spare time. I am sending you this money... because if I keep them with me, they might be spent off. Shashi is fine, and waiting for aunt Sarla's money order. Your daughter, Kiran. See, sister? I had told you that education does not go in vain. Kiran has filled up the lack of a son, hasn't she? - Hasn't she, sister? - Really, Janaki, Kiran is your son. Yes, sister Sarla, she is a son. A son. - Who is it? - It's me, madam, Parkar. - Come in. See? She called us in as soon as she heard my name. I'll be right back. Madam, my prestige... is now in your hands, or rather under your feet. I don't get you, dear. The thing is, madam... that I told one of my friends that I know you well. Now he wants me to arrange a meeting between you and him. Now tell me, what should I do? What's there to worry so much about? I will meet your friend. - Where is your friend? - Standing outside. - Call him in. - Thank you very much, madam. Thank you very much. I am sorry. Come in, dear. - Good evening, madam. - So this is your friend? - Yes, Mr. Raja (king). - The king of which state? My name is Raja, madam. Oh! I see. So you're a king just for name's sake. Not only for name's sake, madam. I am also a king by heart. I want to spend this evening with you. This evening is over. But the night's not over yet. Tell me, in which hotel should I book a room? Mr. Raja, you are a very, very smart person. Thank you, my sweetheart. Talk business. What do you charge? I don't charge; I slap! You're beaten again, Raja. Looks like you didn't recognize her. It's surprising. You didn't recognize me... even after being beater the 3rd time. - You? - Yes, me. Very good. A college student in the morning. And a cabaret dancer at night. You've insulted me the 3rd time today. I will revenge for that. Those who speak too much don't act. If I were in your place, I would have smashed so hard... Enough, Prakash. This punishment is enough for today. My name is Raja, Prakash. I will break your bones today. - Hallo. Hallo. - Why are you peeking in, Parkar? Raja is being welcomed inside. Is he? Then we should also go in... No, no! Let him enjoy. You guys go now. Mr. Reen, good that you've come. Madam wants to see you. Go in. Can I go? Get out of here, or I will hand you over to the police. Got it? - Ok. - Get out! The wound is deep. It is necessary to take an injection and tie bandage. Why need such a long treatment for that? Just put your hand here, and it will be fine. Don't joke. I will go and change. Then we'll go to the doctor. I will come with you, not to the doctor, but to your mother. She lives 100 miles far from here. Doesn't matter even if she lives 1000 miles away. I will go to her today. It is necessary to tell her every thing. Tell her what? That we love each other, want to marry... and have promised to live with each other. And you will agree to me and convince your mother... that whatever I am saying is true. I am not shameless as you are... who would accept her love in front of her mother. It is not shameful to tell one's feelings to one's parents. Rather it's shameful to hide. And you know that one cannot... progress with being shy in this modern days. Just as our Munshiji didn't let his daughter progress. But the son of Thakur Virendrasingh... does not want any obstacles in his wedding. Enough! Enough! Thakur Virendrasingh's son... if you say such boring dialogues of some idiot play... in front of my mother, she will consider you some joker... and deny to marry her daughter to you. I can hear that denial, but I will not accept it. Listen carefully, pretty one, I've vowed that I will make you mine. And even if God himself tells me that... you cannot marry Kiran, do you know what will I answer? Mr. God, it is none of your business. Get ready fast. We'll move from here, ok? Who's knocking on the door so late in the night? Coming, dear. - Who is it? - I've come from Kiran's college. Open the door. - Greetings. - What happened to my daughter? Don't be scared. Nothing's happened to her and she's fine. My name is Prakash. I study with her at the college and want to marry her. What? You... you want to marry Kiran? Yes, and she also wants to marry me. You can ask her if you want. Wait, I'll call her. Kiran! No need to feel shy; I've told your mother everything. - Come. - I won't come. - Come, dear. What is he saying, child? I don't get this. - Speak, child. - What do I say, mother? Kiran is not going to say any thing, auntie. Hear this tape and you'll get every thing. Shall we eat something in the meanwhile? We are hungry. Here, listen to it. Kiran, show me the way to the kitchen. Who would accept her love in front of her mother. It is not shameful to tell one's feelings to one's parents. Rather it's shameful to hide. What was the need to let mother hear that tape? Don't know what rubbish might be stored in it. Nothing stored in it except our love story. You're strange! What might she think of us? What might she think? Are we saying something new to this world? We're doing what our ancestors have already done. Now I won't be able to look into my mom's eyes. Who is asking you to look in her eyes? Just walk behind your groom like a shy bride... with the drape on the head and eyes facing down. - What did you say? - Please, make tea for me. Just as our Munshiji didn't let his daughter progress. Munshi Dindayal? But the son of Thakur Virendrasingh does not want... Thakur Virendrasingh? He is Thakur Virendrasingh's son? He is my son? My son! No, no! What is this terrible incident, Lord? A brother wants to marry his sister? No, no! This cannot happen, God. Tell me, O Lord, what do I do now? You've heard the tape recorder, auntie. Now bless us quickly and sweeten our mouths. What is it, auntie? Why are you silent? - This marriage cannot take place. - Auntie! You are Thakur Virendrasingh's son, right? - Yes, do you know him? - Very well. He is a very rich and famous man. I cannot let my daughter marry his son. Is his being rich a crime, auntie? People have exaggerated his fame. You are denying just as Munshiji denied, scared of his fame. He ruined the life of my brother and his own daughter. - Brother? Which brother? - My elder bro, Surajprakash. What did you say your name was? I told you it's Chandraprakash. My brother is like an angel. He accepted Mushiji's wish. But I won't accept either your denial or my parents'. You will have to bless us. Please, auntie, agree to us. Now that you've decided, how can I refuse? Thank you, auntie. Now get ready fast and come with me to meet my parents. Not now, child. I will come to meet him soon. - Really, auntie? - Yes, I will surely come. I will inform Kiran before coming. Kiran, your mommy is great! - Mother! - My child! We take your leave now, auntie. We are to attend the college next morning. Come, Kiran. - Go, Kiran. - Bye, mom. May Lord always keep you happy! You are lying, Raja. Prakash can never do that. If you think I'm accusing Prakash... come with me and see for yourself. Elder nephew, I will also come with you. Where are you planning to go, brother in law? Why don't you also come with us, brother in law? Where? What's the matter? It's nothing, father. Raja wants to take me to a program. Uncle is saying that he will also come along. Brother, your hair is turning grey. You are not at the age of attending programs. Your sister is going to the temple; go with her. You might wash some of your sins. You don't hear the whole matter, and then keep scolding me. - Ok, tell me. - I won't say any thing now. Child, I've got rid of your uncle. Now run off to the program, or he'll be after you again. 'He held my hand and hugged me in the dark street' 'He held my hand and hugged me in the dark street' 'Wasn't it you, dear? O my God! ' 'He held my hand and hugged me in the dark street' 'Wasn't it you, dear? O my God! ' 'He held my hand and hugged me in the dark street' 'That naughty guy looked very handsome. How do I explain you? ' 'He was as fearless as you in fighting' 'Look at this dark night, dear' 'Look at this dark night, dear' 'It created such a tragedy, dear' 'He held my hand and hugged.' 'He held my hand and hugged me in the dark street' 'Wasn't it you, dear? O my God! ' 'He held my hand and hugged me in the dark street' 'Since that day, dear, some lightening shines in my body' 'I am crazy. Why do I dress up and come to meet you? ' 'I left from home alone' 'I left from home alone' 'What a terrible thing I have done! ' 'He held my hand and hugged.' 'He held my hand and hugged me in the dark street' 'Wasn't it you, dear? O my God! ' 'He held my hand and hugged me in the dark street' 'Wasn't it you, dear? O my God! ' 'O my God! ' Prakash, I will wash the makeup and change. Ok? - Perfectly all right. - Then we'll leave together. I get it now. So it's you who brought Suraj here? You can take it that way, dear. Ok, now tell me something, dear. What will you gain by making them quarrel? - I will get what I want. - You mean? Kiran will not be able to meet Prakash from today onwards. - And start meeting you?! - I hate her. - I see. I will get her thrown out of the college. - I will insult her on every step. - Very good. She will cry, she will suffer... and will fall at my feet some day to ask forgiveness. Why are you coming with me? Go back. Is it wrong if I walk a few more steps with you? Yes, the name of that badness is Shashi, and she is awake. She is awake, and also hearing her insult. I am going, dear. Why such a hurry? Say some thing to me; listen to some thing. It's too late; go to sleep. There's a letter from Janaki auntie. She has a message for you. For me? What does she write? She writes that she will stay at Munshi Dindayal's place. - Tell that to Prakash. So I've told you. - So I've heard. Kiran, we will go to... Munshiji's place tomorrow after the college. - Ok, good night. - Good night. Why did you read my letter? It's a postcard. The postman must have read it, too. Don't blabber. - Kiran, shall I tell you something? - Tell me. You will be going to your matrimonial house tomorrow. - Dress up nicely. - Go in. Go! Brother, you're still awake? Why haven't you gone to sleep? Who was the girl with whom you were dancing at the hotel? You had gone to the hotel? I had to go to see your deeds. When Raja told me I could not believe, but... So you went there just because Raja told you? - He's a big scoundrel. - And you're worse than him. You're ready to defame... the prestige of our family for a mere dancer? He is a very good girl, brother. I wanted you to listen to her voice that day. I've listened to her voice and also seen her face. And also seen the glow on her face... which was a show for the people. And now she wants to trap you and blot our prestige. I won't let that happen. The one you're calling a dancer... is a daughter of decent parents. She studies with me at the college. Studies at the college and dances at hotels. Is this her decency? One does not lose his decency just by dancing at hotels. She dances to help her poor mother. She's found a good excuse to fool you. Your giving away your love to please mother was sacrifice. And if she dances at a hotel... to help her mother, that's an excuse? Decency is not a private property of any one. The rich ones have to take... the help of money to prove their decency. While to the poor, decency is their only property. I don't believe in... this segregation of the rich and poor either. But I do believe in familial prestige. I assure you of that, brother. Kiran's mother is coming here tomorrow. Meet her and you'll know how good those people are. If that is so, I promise you... I won't let you sacrifice your love as I did. Thank you, brother. Raja, if you still have any tricks left, use them, too. So that you won't regret later. Get out! That's fine, Janaki. But marrying Kiran to Prakash is impossible. Why? Will Mr. Thakur refuse? No, he won't refuse. He is like an angel. But, Janaki, your daughter is not to be... the daughter in law of Mr. Thakur, but that of his family. And daughters of lower status families... cannot be the daughters in law of that family. I had washed everything out of my memory, Munshiji. But destiny has brought me again at this crossroad. Tell me what should I do. Janaki, if you want to save your dignity like I did... convince Kiran in any way and take her back. How will I be able to convince her, Munshiji? I will do that. I will tell her that... for years of my loyalty towards them... I got the disappointment of my dear daughter in return. Tell me, Janaki, how will you go there... and propose for your daughter? Father is right, auntie. Don't go there. No one gets anything except insults from that family. Kiran, your mother is going to meet my mother today. I hope you won't feel shy. Greetings, auntie. Greetings, Munshiji. Mother, you never told me anything about Munshiji. - Greetings, Munshiji. - God bless you, child. Come, auntie; I've come to take you. Everyone's waiting for you. Kiran, we cannot go at Mr. Thakur's place. - What are you saying? - Why not, mother? I don't want you and Janaki to go there. There has to be some reason to deny, Munshiji. My status is not so... that I can propose them for your marriage. And if you go, your mother will be insulted so badly... that you won't be able to bear it. It is you who are insulting, Munshiji. My brother and father are not so bad... that they would call someone home and then insult them. Rest assured, auntie. You will get the same respect... in my house that a girl's mother should get. Mother, I swear on you... that if you are insulted in that house... I will forget Prakash for good. Please, auntie... don't decide anything before meeting my family. It is a matter of Kiran's and my life. I will take you with me. - Please, come with me. - Please come, mother. - What are you thinking? - Nothing, child. I was just thinking that Janaki's going there is not good. Prakash and Kiran's stubbornness will ruin Janaki's old age. Do this. Bring my umbrella and hat. Go fast. - Did you get it clearly? - Yes, sir. - Here. You will get what you ask after the job's done. This is a very simple task. Will be done today. Good. That's what I want. Brother, I've brought auntie and Kiran with me. 'Swings on the swing of my heart' 'Your son.' 'Swings on the swing of my heart' 'Your... your... your son.' 'Swings on the swing of my heart' I am meeting you for the first time today. But don't know why I feel as if I've known you for years. You both must have had some relation in your past lives. Come; my mother is waiting for you. Come. See, Kiran? Brother took auntie with so much respect. Mother, she is Kiran's mother. - Greetings. Where is Kiran? - Coming with Prakash. Come, sister. Come. Sit down. Mother! She is Kiran. Dear, where did you find such a good daughter in law for me? He didn't find her, mother. He got her by good luck. Child, what does your father do? Mother, I've found out every thing about their family from Prakash. Their family is no less in prestige than ours. Then I don't need to ask any thing. Sister, my Suraj is very mature. He understands my feelings even before I voice them. His father has handed the business to him. May God give a son like him to everyone! Strange, mother! You're praising only brother. Praise me sometimes. Sister, he is very worthless. Guys these days decide every thing on themselves. We are just to fulfill the rituals. So let's do it. I've taken your daughter, and given you my son. You've honored me by accepting my Kiran. Now sweeten everyone's mouth quickly. We will do that, son. But first call your uncle. Let him see our daughter in law. - Meanwhile your father will also come. - Ok. Sister, relations are predestined. My naive Suraj had chosen a girl... who was not appropriate for our family. Congratulations, sister! Congratulations... - Why are you looking that way? - I am seeing God's miracle, sister. She's become young again in the form of her daughter. Do you know her? Who doesn't know her, sis? The whole city knows her. You know her, too. She is the famous singer of the city, Janakibai. You're taken in by him, mother? You know uncle has the habit of spreading poison. It is she who has come to spread the poison. I am just curing. Suraj, you had found out about them, hadn't you? Uncle is mistaken, mother. They are poor, but they are decent and good people. I will show you how decent they are. Didn't you find anyone else except... a prostitute's daughter to make our daughter in law? No! For God's sake, don't say such bad words to me. Will you be able to hide your reality by taking the help of God? I will say it a thousand times that... Shut up! Or I will slap you. Yes, your mother had punched my heart; you can slap me. Uncle, if you will say even a word about them, I won't spare you. I knew, child, I had no status to come to this house. But you both acted stubborn. I have done a mistake. I didn't know they would accuse you so badly to refuse me. Come; let's go back. Wait, Kiran. Prakash brought you here on my instigation. And I cannot tolerate your mother being accused so badly. Uncle, you will have to prove whatever you've said... I will prove that. See this. And this. And you see, too. Ask your mother whether she had come... to sing on my Suraj's naming ceremony or not? Speak now, Janakibai. Why are you silent? Why are you hiding your face? Now I get why you didn't want to come here. If you had told me earlier... why would I come here to get insulted? - I would have drowned myself. - Kiran! - Your Kiran is dead! - Kiran, stop! - Stop, Prakash. You cannot stop me, brother. Whoever or however she might be, I will marry only her. Keep quiet! A daughter of a prostitute cannot be our daughter in law. Brother, I will abandon this world for Kiran. Wait, Kiran! What happened, Prakash? Why was Kiran crying? Parkar! What's happened to both of them? Get out of here! - What are you doing? - I am doing the right thing. - Let me go, Thakur. - No, Janaki, you cannot go. - Let her be thrown out... - Shut up, Ratna. You don't know what you're saying. You don't know, father, she had come... to propose her daughter's marriage with Prakash. She wanted to blot the family... which has been spotless for generations. - She's a prostitute... - Idiot! Who told you that she is a prostitute? Sir Thakur! Forgive me, Janaki. It's the first time I've beaten your son. I've done a mistake. Her child? Suraj, her child? Yes, Ratna, Suraj is her son and not yours. What? Suraj is not our child? What are you saying? That what I couldn't say for 25 years. Ratna, the one you're calling a prostitute... is as holy as the waters of Ganga. Thousands of decent women can be sacrificed for her. She let go of her maternal love and gave her child to you. Because the child... you gave birth to 25 years back was born dead. What? If you knew that as a result to your prayers... God had given you a dead child, you would have died, Ratna. This goddess not only gave you her child, but also a new life. She is still silent after such a bad insult... because she had promised that to keep silent. But what is surprising is that... why didn't her own blood recognize her? Wretched! Why didn't you become dumb before... calling your own mother a prostitute? Come here, Janaki. Ratna, ask her forgiveness right now or I will never forgive you. Sir, it's not madam's fault. She knew nothing of this matter. Do you hear this, Ratna? This is called loyalty. It was he who got the child from her so that you might stay alive. But you got provoked by this low and... worthless brother of yours and called Munshiji a servant. You also ruined his daughter's life. It is scoundrels like you who ruin the life of decent girls. Go away from here or I'll shoot you. Suraj, you also... Catch them! Take them from here. - Hallo. - Brother Suraj? - Yes, it's me. Raja's men have caught Prakash and Kiran. - What? - They've gone at the Ghost Bungalow. - Their lives are in danger. Please, come soon. - Okay. Come soon. I'll meet you outside the bungalow. Let go of Kiran, Raja, or I will kill you. Kid, save your life first. You cannot save yourself from me, Kiran. I will revenge for each of my insults today. Parkar! Scoundrel! I will break your head. Let go of me! Leave, I said. Leave me! What has happened, Suraj? I got this moment after so many years... when I could call my son as my son. Don't cry, mother. You should be happy that... your son killed a wicked person to save his sister. I have done no crime. Brother, I am so unlucky. I could not tie Rakhi on your hands, but got handcuffs for you. Your Honor... the prosecution finishes its procedure with this statement. And requests the court to sentence Suraj... a deserving punishment for killing Raja. No, Lord, no! I suffered all my life, but never asked any thing from you. Today I beg of you to get my son released. You will have to answer to an aggrieved mother's prayers, God. Taking all witnesses and statements into account... the court decides that murdered Raja was a bad man. He tried to rape the sister of the accused. And so the accused tried to save his sister. In that fight, Raja lost his life. This does not prove the crime of the accused. So this court releases the accused man, Suraj. Brother in law! What's this? What is this black thing on your face? I've smeared my face... with black color before people would do it. Till sister Janaki and Munshiji don't forgive me... my face will remain black like this. Sister Janaki, do you forgive me? Thank you. Brother in law, what about you? Go and wash your face. Now you guys forgive me, too. Have you? Thank you. Thank you.
