Didn't you grasp that suspect? Here it is What happened? He won't confess? Mr Chen What have you to say about The suspect being killed at the car-park? I'm not satisfied with their explanation myself Chia-hui, you knew best the situation then Me? Come on, speak the truth I really have nothing to say Good, but no point in finding any excuse A gunman breaking into the police station to kill doesn't happen every day Just raise your vigilance from now on And you're lucky No one around the suspect was injured This means he's a sharpshooter So the Serious Crimes Section has specially sent Two aces to take over this case But they need 2 men to lead them in that territory To lead blind men? Any volunteers stand up How's it? What's up? No problem? OK Are you volunteers? One man and one girl, just right Report at once. Good luck!

I mean to review it once We'd understand better if you spoke Chinese The picture showing the damage to the payroll van You can imagine the power of the guns used We understand that No need to explain I don't I'm stupid The fact that they even owned Remington guns could link them with the arms syndicate Could it be those guns lost by security guards? Not yet your turn to speak This is the position where the arrested bandit got hit How was the situation then? They say after Chia-hui arrested him At the car-park he...

Ask inspector Liu It was his decision You're really narrow-minded I can't forget this, I'm not reconciled What's wrong?

No They're fighting. What now? Go in and stop them, quick! Don't! Stop it! Talk it over You know what his strong suit is?
