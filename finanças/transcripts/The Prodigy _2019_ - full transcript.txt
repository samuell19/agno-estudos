No! No! He took my hand. He took my hand! Talulah, stop. Honey? Is he early? Yeah. It's only the 22nd. He couldn't wait, John. Honey. I think you might need these. You okay? - Me? - Yeah. Good, yeah. Yeah, seriously. I'm good. You'll never believe it. We're gonna bring you home a little brother. Finally. You want to try Dr. Lee again? - Okay. - Just a sec, okay? Looks good, right? Everything looks good? You okay? Good. Okay? Listen. - Good. - Breathe, baby, breathe. Good, good. - Good. - Breathe. Take a breath. Ready? Push. Push, push, push. - Good. Push. - Push, breathe, breathe. - Great, good, good. - Okay... Here he comes! Police! Get down on your knees! You heard him! Get down! Stay where you are! Get down on your knees! He's got something behind his back! - What the hell was that? - Get a light on him. Go through the house. Make sure nobody's inside. Bravo team, let's go inside. You're perfect. He's perfect. Are his eyes different colors? Yeah, it's called heterochromia. It's a genetic trait. He's like David Bowie. He is. He is my little glam rocker. We tried so long to have you. We weren't sure you'd ever come. It's gonna be... Okay. There we go. Isn't he supposed to cry? Well, most do, but it's not required. Is everything all right? Nothing wrong with this little guy. - He is very aware. - Yes. Mama. Did he really just say that? You know, he's even been using some words. That's quite early. Usually, language doesn't come on for about a year or so. There's nothing wrong. Your son's just developing early. He's what we call a smarty-pants. Smarty-pants. Good job, honey. Can you show me again? Put him inside the castle? What are you reading? Nurturing Genius. Yes. A Gifted Life. I'm preparing. For what? Miles' brain isn't wired like other kids. Yes! He's special. Good job! And I was thinking, we should really start thinking about preschool, seriously. Preschools? He's two. Isn't that a bit early? These aren't regular preschools. They're special. It's a preschool. We need a letter of recommendation? Honey, it's a very good preschool. Are we going to Dr. Collins? No, Mom's taking you to see a different doctor. Go. Good. Very fast. Go. You were right to bring him in. Miles' intelligence is off the charts. I don't have an exact score, but it'll be very high. How about his behavior? Is he adjusting well to preschool? He's been having a very difficult time making friends. Well, Miles' brain is extremely well-developed in certain regions, but there are other areas that appear to be delayed. I'm not sure why he wouldn't be as developed in those areas, but we need to watch it. And you and your husband should really consider a dedicated education plan. There's this excellent school, it's called Penmark. It's a little bit more expensive than the school you have him at now, but they're just outstanding with kids with specialized needs, just like Miles. I can call ahead for you, if you like. Here. Finish your homework after you eat. That's not homework, by the way. We don't have homework. Yeah? How come I had homework when I was a kid? Because you're not as smart as me. Excuse me? Yeah? Do you have any paprika? Paprika? How do you even know what that is? I don't know. Just want some. I am so ready to go out tonight. Here. Knock yourself out. Excuse me. When did you start using that? - I don't know. - Hey. Can you please do that eye thing for me? There it is! Do you wanna do a staring contest? No, you have to finish your dinner. Okay, all right. Your mom said only two episodes. Tell you what. What if we play one game before bedtime? Just one. Hide-and-seek. Okay. You want me to count or hide? You count. Cool. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten! Ready or not, here I come! What're you doing? You're supposed to hide. Miles, are you okay? You want more time? Okay, cool. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten... 11, 12, 13, 14... 15... ...17, 18... 19... 20. Okay. Ready or not, here I come! Okay, I got you. Okay, I give up. You can come up now. Miles! Miles? Miles! Miles! I want you to tell me everything that you remember. Me and Zoe were watching TV, then she was hurt. Then... Then she started screaming. And then I saw blood. Miles, you must remember something else. When did Zoe go into the basement? I don't know. She was counting and then she was hurt. There was blood everywhere - and I didn't know what to do. - Okay. It's okay, sweetie. I don't remember anything. It's okay. It was an accident. It was just an accident. Talulah. What's up? Hey! What are you doing here? I heard you talking in your sleep. You were having a bad dream. No, I wasn't. I mean, it wasn't a bad dream, it was a good dream. I wanna work with Hailey. Sorry, we already made our plan. Yeah, go ahead and use the bathroom, Miles. Dash. Dash! Help him! What do you see in this one? A face. Whose face? I don't know. And what do you see in that one? Hands. Whose hands? The hands of a nice lady. When you hit that boy at school, can you remember what you were feeling? You can tell me how you felt. I thought if I did it, I wouldn't get hurt anymore. Get hurt? Has someone hurt you? I'm afraid to tell you. I don't want anyone to get in trouble. Who? Get who in trouble? The person who's been hurting me. I want to consider a course of medication for Miles and he may need a specialist. A behavioral interventionist, someone who can help him - with his anger issues. - Okay. What's wrong with him? At first, I thought it might be a deficit in his cognitive morality or maybe ODD... Oppositional defiance disorder, but honestly... I'm not sure. Maybe you should listen to this. I recorded this while he was sleeping. Yeah, okay. Sarah, I hate to ask this. Is there any possibility that Miles has suffered some kind of abuse from someone in your family? What the hell are you accusing me of? I am not accusing you of anything, John. I'm telling you what she said. I never touched our son. Is this about my dad? My dad was a piece of shit. I have processed all of that. You know that. That was part of us deciding to have kids. I would never hit Miles. I love that kid. Maybe Strasser's wrong. You've always said he's wired differently. What if this is just the way he is? This is not the way that he is. All right. I don't understand what's happening, John. I don't understand what's going on. I just checked on him. That medication really knocked him out. You okay? I'm sorry. We're gonna figure this out, all right? Yeah. Hey, I'm worried about you, too. I feel like I'm going crazy. It's gonna be okay. We just have to keep strong. Okay? Okay. Go fuck yourself. What is it? What happened? What happened? There's someone in here. Where? He's in here. Honey, it sounds like you were having a bad dream. - No. No. - There's no one in here. No. He's in here. He's inside here. - He's inside here. - Okay, come here. Baby. Arthur, hi. Elaine Strasser. Yeah, do you... Do you have a minute? - Hi, Sarah. - Hi. They lock it up on the weekends. Thanks for coming in on such short notice. Arthur Jacobson. It's a pleasure to meet you. Hello. Has Elaine explained anything about the type of research I do? Good. I'd like to start with a few questions before we get into that. Okay. Does anyone in your family speak a foreign language, Sarah? John and I both took Spanish in high school but neither of us remember more than a few words. And what about the boy's grandparents? Any recent immigrants in your family? I'm sorry, I'm confused. Is this your son's voice? Yes. Yes, that's Miles. It's just some gibberish from a dream. Actually, it's not gibberish. I had the words translated by a colleague of mine. What is it? Hungarian. Specifically, a rare dialect of Hungarian only spoken near the Romanian border. Listen to what happens next, Sarah. This is equally important. I heard you talking in your sleep. You were having a bad dream. No, I wasn't. I mean, it wasn't a bad dream, it was a good dream. Miles says it was a good dream. Why is that important? The words, Sarah. What Miles said. "Shut up, you filthy whore. "Stop crying or I'll cut your eyes out. "I'm going to watch you die." No. No, Miles did not say that. But he did. And he did it in a dialect spoken by less than 400,000 people in the world. Does Miles get along well with children his age? Has he ever mentioned feeling displaced in his body? Yes. What about his taste in food? Have you noticed any change in his palate? These are indicators. Indicators of what? Half the people on earth, billions of them, believe that consciousness and energy, what we often refer to as our souls, are capable of returning to this physical realm to live new lives. It's only foreign to Western minds. In most of the world, reincarnation is an accepted part of life. Reincarnation? What are we talking about? Let me tell you about a boy I met when I was in India. His name was Padman, around six years old. But his family claimed he was much older. He could remember every detail from a previous life. The bakery he owned, his siblings, his mother's favorite song. He even described his death in detail, what it felt like when he was drowning. I found the town he described about 100 miles from his village, and I took Padman there. He showed me directly to the house where he was born. Introduced me to his brothers and sisters who were by now over 50 years old. We stayed there for three weeks with an old woman he claimed to be his mother, singing to her as she passed away. Now, I believe that the soul inside Padman drowned before he had a chance to say goodbye to his mother. And when we allowed this entity to finish what it had left undone, Padman returned to being a little boy. In an instant, he was back, with very little memory of what had happened. This would explain so much. The crucial thing to understand here is that these souls return for a reason. To complete something left unfinished, to find closure. So, you're saying that my son is possessed? No. Possession refers to a non-human entity taking control of a human host. So the invading soul in my son was another human? Yes. And from what I heard on that tape, that person is dangerous. Sarah, there's a battle being waged inside your son. A war between his natural soul and this older one. These two entities cannot exist in the same body forever. One will become dominant and the other will be absorbed. This is what we're trying to avoid. I'm sorry, I can't do this. Sarah. Sarah, wait. Just, please... Just watch this. I know how hard this is for you. I thought that you were gonna help my son. Miles may have developmental issues, but he is still my son. And I am not going to subject him to this. Hey, Mom, wanna do a staring contest? I'm not in the mood right now, Miles. Okay. One, two, three. I don't like it when you touch me like that, Miles. What is that song? What? That song you were just humming. I've heard you singing it before. Where did you learn it? - From you. - No, you didn't. I would've remembered. You used to sing it to me when I was a baby. While I was sleeping. No, I didn't. Excuse me. I'm sorry. Andrea and Bruce of Lafayette, Louisiana, are a highly educated modern couple. To them, the possibility that their little son, James, was manifesting signs of a former life was, well, a little out there. Between the ages of two and four, James would reveal extraordinary details about the life of a former fighter pilot. I believe that he had a past life and he came back because he wasn't finished with something. We are taught at a very early age... What is that? ...that reincarnation doesn't exist. A colleague of Dr. Strasser's gave it to me. You went to see another doctor? His name is Arthur Jacobson and he studies reincarnation. Reincarnation? - Past lives? - Yes. Come on, Sarah. This is the oldest trick in the book. He knows from Strasser that we're having trouble with Miles. Just look at this. Just look at this little boy. He... It's incredible. Please. Hey. Please don't tell me you believe in any of this. I don't know what I believe. Miles is sick. This isn't about past lives. This is hard. But we can get through this. We can help Miles. Just not with this kind of craziness. - Yeah. - Yeah. You're right. Not with this. This is nuts. Hey, Miles? Five minutes, then PJs, okay? Talulah! Get! What did you say, Mommy? What? Who can tell me the difference between the denominator and the numerator? Anyone? Okay, I have a better question. Who likes pizza? Me! Me! Me! Yes. So, how many slices on a pizza? Kill him, take his weapon! Good job, soldier! I need a medic! Take cover! Take cover! Talulah! Sarah? You seen Talulah? No. The back gate's open. I'm gonna go look for her. - Take him down! - Miles. Honey, go help your dad look for the dog. Double kill! Miles? Finish him off, soldier! Head shot! Kill him! Now! Move, move, soldier! Move! Let's go. She never goes this far away from the house. Maybe she got hit by a car. Why would you say that? When a dog knows it's gonna die, it doesn't come home. They drag themselves under a house. They like to die alone. We all have to go sometime. Even you. You're gonna die. I'm your father, Miles, you do not talk to me like that. Or what? Are you gonna hit me? Like your father used to do to you? What are you talking about? He was such a piece of shit. And now, you're such a great dad to me. You never told him anything about my dad? Never, honey, I've never said anything to him. He was saying all this creepy shit. Like what? John, what was he saying? How would he know? Know what? What the hell is that? It's a camera. What? My God. He used the baby monitor. He's been spying on us. Hey! How long have you been watching us? - Look at me. Where's Talulah? - I don't know. - Where is she? - I don't know! - Where is she? - John, stop it! What the hell's wrong with you? Where's Daddy? Daddy needed a little bit of space. He's at Uncle Tommy's house. Just until he cools down a little bit. Mommy? What's wrong with me? Miles, you're sick. You're just sick, honey. Sometimes I leave my body when I'm lying in bed. Sometimes dreams can feel real. They're not dreams, I do it when I'm awake. I do it to make room. Make room for what? Things. How often does this happen? Every night. Miles? Miles, what's wrong? Mommy, I'm scared. Come here, baby. - Come here. - Mommy! Were you having a dream? Yes. Can I sleep with you tonight? Mommy? Yes, baby? Will you always love me no matter what I do? Yes, Miles. I will always love you. I'm your mother. What... What is it? Mommy? Use this. Miles, what did you do? Sometimes when I leave my body, bad things happen. Mommy! Miles, be quiet. It was my fault. It was me. Listen to me. I'm gonna take you to somebody who can help you get better. Sarah. I was so relieved when you called. So you must be Miles. Watch the silver eye. Just watch. The regression won't work if you're in the room. Is this going to hurt him? No. It's hypnosis. Miles goes out of body when the invading soul is present. He won't even remember the experience. The goal here is to identify the person who has returned and, this is important... Find out what they want. I'm going to be candid with you, Sarah. This may be your last chance. Miles is eight now. Soon the invading soul will have control and Miles will be gone. Watch the silver eye on top of the arm. Every time it swings, let's pretend we're unraveling a piece of string little by little. Let's pretend that piece of string is time. Unraveling minute by minute, second by second, going backwards. Time slipping away. Everything around you... This house, my voice, your mother... All these things are getting further away. We're going back through your life, back to when you started school, when you first learned to walk, when you were just a baby. Back to the day you were born. Back to the time before this body. I'm no longer speaking to Miles. I'm speaking to the person who has taken residence inside his body. You came uninvited. Tell me if you can hear my voice. You speak Hungarian. I learned a few words in anticipation of meeting you. I prefer English. But you were born in Hungary? My parents were Hungarian farmers that moved to Ohio. Simple people. Just happy to own the piece of land. I was driven to more creative things. I would like you to tell me your name and why you've come back here. What is your name? I am Miles now. Miles, if you can hear my voice, tell me the name of the person inside you. Tell me the name. Tell me the name. Tell me the name. Miles, tell me the name. No! You have quite a collection of medication in your bathroom. Everything there is legal. Not if you give it to a minor against his will. Did you take my pills? What would Sarah think if I told her I fell asleep in here and woke up with your cock in my mouth? Then the police find drugs in my blood. The same drugs from your medicine cabinet. Not to mention the pubic hairs with your DNA that I found on the rim of your toilet and placed in my teeth. You're insane. Who will they believe? An aging hippie living off his family's fortune? Or an innocent little boy? When I snap my fingers, Miles will return and you will tell Sarah that you have failed to regress him because there isn't anyone inside her son. Then you will leave and that will be the last time you will ever see us. One, two, three. How did it go? It didn't. I'm sorry, I was wrong. It was a mistake to ask you to come here. What happened? Nothing. The regression didn't work. - What? - I'm sorry. - What? - Christopher will see you out. This way, please. Miles. Go inside. I need to talk to your father. I don't feel safe with him in the house. I made some calls while I was at Tommy's. There's a place called Summit Hill. I think Miles would be a good fit. He would have round-the-clock supervision. It's less than an hour from here. We're talking about locking up our son? What else can we do? This is tearing us apart, Sarah. - Hello? - Sarah. It's Arthur Jacobson. Arthur, it's 2:00 a.m. I know. I'm sorry, this can't wait. Is Miles near you? Yes, he's in his room. Sarah, go to your computer. Arthur, I'm gonna hang up the phone. Sarah, wait. Your family's in danger. Go to a computer where Miles won't be able to see you. Hang on. Listen to me. The person inside your son is an exceptional liar. He'll pretend he's sleeping, he'll pretend he's your son. You can't trust anything Miles says. I couldn't talk when Miles was here. During our session, there was a struggle, but I think your son heard me. It just took a moment to figure it out. He scratched what I realized was a message, the name. He gave me the name, Sarah. Type "Edward Scarka" into your computer. S-C-A-R-K-A. The Thrush Creek Killer. That's him. Look at the eyes. They're two different colors, just like Miles. When's Miles' birthday? August 22nd, 2010. That's the day Edward Scarka was killed in a police raid. He died just after 4:00 a.m. Miles was born at 4:15 a.m. He killed nine women over a span of five years. The last victim, the tenth one, managed to get away, but not before he cut off her hand. They all had their hands removed. That was his trademark. He would cut off their hands, then kill them. Cut off their hands, then kill them. The survivor, Margaret St. James, wrote a book about her ordeal. She led the police to him, where they gunned him down. So now we know. Right? Yes, but we still need to know the reason why he's come back. What Scarka wants. That's what will free your son. Wait. Arthur, I have to go now. John. What's going on? We have to do something about Miles. We have to do something about Miles right away. But he absolutely cannot know. Wait an hour. I'll pack some of his clothes and meet you there. Is there another fraction that is equal to two-eighths? So can we simplify to... Mr. Blume. Is everything okay? Yeah. I'm here to pick up Miles. Well, we're almost finished our lesson, I can bring him out in just a second. No, I'm sorry, we gotta go now. It's a family emergency. Right. Do you need to sign out in the office? No, Sarah just called over. Spoke with them. Hey, Miles, come on. Let's go. Miles? Let's go, buddy. Miles! Oh my God. He came back for you. He wants you dead. Miles, your mother and I had to make a decision. You're gonna go and live somewhere for a while. And... The place where we're going has people who can help you get better. Really good doctors. It's gonna be tough for a while, but I think as you get older, you'll understand that sometimes... Sometimes what's best for us is the hardest thing for us to do. We just want you to know that we love you very much. More than anything in the world. Miles... Miles! He's fighting very hard right now. We'll have to keep him unconscious for three or four weeks. When the swelling in his brain goes down, we'll determine the extent of his injury. Your husband's strong. What he needs is time. Where is my son? He's across the hall. I'm so sorry. I love you. I love you. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I think I know how to stop this. I think I can save him. If we do this, maybe... Maybe we could all be back together again. I'll leave you two alone. Miles, what happened in the car? I don't know. I don't remember anything. I know how I can help you. But I need you to trust me. I need you to trust me, whatever I do. Can you do that? Do you remember those pills I gave you so you didn't get car sick? You remember how it made you sleepy? Yeah. I need you to sleep. But why? Because I can't trust you until you're all better. I want to see you take it, Miles. Where are we going? Shut your eyes. I'm gonna take care of what you came back for. Can I help you? Are you Margaret St. James? What do you want? My name is Sarah Blume. I recently had an experience, and your book, it... It helped me. I was wondering if you had a moment. I have a rule of not seeing people in my home. Just five minutes. Please? I have nowhere else to go. I'll make some tea. You can grab a seat. Pickles, you're just gonna wanna come back inside as soon as you see how cold it is. Yeah, okay. Here you go. Go on. Peppermint or lemon? Either one. This thing's not pretty, but it can tear a piece of toilet paper. I'm so sorry. Was it recent, what happened to you? It's been going on for a while. It's my son. This is about your son? Yes, Miles. How old is he? He's eight. That's a wonderful age. My David was so sweet at that age. I didn't know that you had children. I've made a choice to keep my family private. David's father and I got divorced before I met Scarka. But I didn't feel it was fair to link them to all that pain and hate. Where is your son now? Starting sophomore year at Michigan State. And from what I hear, he has a new girlfriend, too. It's okay. You'll get through this. I shouldn't have come here. May I use your restroom? Yeah, it's just down the hall. I'll make you that cup of tea. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Pickles. How'd you get back inside? What are you doing? What are you doing? Stop. Stop. Please don't... No. I can't. I can't. I'm so sorry. Hey! Which one you like better? Blue or hazel? Blue or hazel? Blue or hazel? How do you... That's what he said the night I met him. Miles! No, don't! Miles, no! No. You should never have left me, Margaret. Miles! Miles, it's over! Miles! Miles! Miles! Miles! Miles. Baby... Miles... It's too late. You got what you came for. Let me have my son. You still believe Miles is alive? Did he sound like this? Mommy? Will you always love me no matter what I do? You were easy. I knew you would bring me to her. How long has he been gone? The night you promised you would always love him... ...that was the last time he ever spoke to you. He's gone now. You are a monster. You took my son's soul? You will not... You cannot have his body! Jesus! She was trying to kill me. You're safe now. You're safe. No. No. Sorry, we're running behind. It's fine. It's great to see you again, Miles. We're excited you'll be staying with us while your dad gets better. Wanna see your room?
