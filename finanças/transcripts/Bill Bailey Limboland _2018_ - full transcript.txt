Hello. Good evening, Hammersmith. Hmm. Yes, it is I. This is my new name for Britain, Limboland. People have suggested others. Poundland. Uh, Leavakia. Uh... Who is gonna take us forward in these uncertain times, these tumultuous waters? Well, it's not gonna be the Greens, is it? God love 'em. God love the Greens. Closest to my political heart. But they are, they're well-meaning, but helpless, aren't they, you know? They're just useless, the Greens. They're like a CND sticker on a submarine, you know. They just... Every election I'm willing them to say something that isn't bereft of common sense. Come on! Come on! You can do it! Uh, we want to scrap the army. Ugh... And what? And replace it with a stout wicker fence. Oh, Christ. Not again. Cars are illegal. Petrol's free. Yes, thank you, thank you. My local hospital's been torn down. Been replaced with an app. Uh... You download it, it tells you where you can harvest local medicinal herbs, just like Tinder for witch hazel. And... But I'm a massive supporter of the NHS. Is there any NHS supporters? Any NHS workers? Big up yourselves. Massive respect. My mum and dad worked in the NHS their whole lives. I couldn't do that job. Well, I haven't got the qualifications, obviously. I'd be a liability if anything. "Hold on, mate. I'll Google it." It's not just about qualifications, is it? It's a vocational thing. You've got to know what to say to people sometimes in difficult times. You've got to know what to say. You've got to be compassionate and firm. You've got to be tender. I don't think I've got it in me. I think I'm too emotionally glib. If I had to be the bearer of bad news, I'd probably get it all wrong, you know. I'd probably do it in song form. That'd be wrong, wouldn't it? Come out like this. ♪ I've seen your scans ♪ Don't make any plans ♪ A farming incident in Ukraine ♪ ♪ Poultry will never be the same ♪ ♪ A revolution the world held its breath ♪ ♪ The day the chickens marched on Kiev ♪ ♪ Their beaks are shiny and not very long ♪ ♪ Their wings are tiny and not very strong ♪ ♪ Bravely they marched their banners all a flutter ♪ ♪ Stop pumping us with garlic butter ♪ ♪ The first to fall was the bravest of fowl ♪ ♪ He attacked a queue in KFC ♪ They killed him with a trowel ♪ ♪ They grabbed the body 'cause the staff were gonna chuck it ♪ ♪ They buried him with some coleslaw in a hero's bucket ♪ ♪ Hurrah, hurrah ♪ This chicken havoc we are wreaking ♪ ♪ Rejoice, rejoice ♪ The ducks have taken Peking ♪ Nothing left all streets swept clean ♪ ♪ No chickens no chickens to be seen ♪ ♪ Just a lone voice in this poultry Waterloo ♪ ♪ You can cut off our heads ♪ But we'll still be chasing you ♪ ♪ The day the chickens marched on Kiev ♪ Cheers.

The cockney marathon I call it. Yeah, that's it. Move it up, yeah. ♪ Do me a favor ♪ I'm doing the cockney marathon ♪ I just love it. I had a very odd experience in Tallinn in Estonia. Some years ago I did a sitcom called Black Books. - And in it... ...there was a scene in it where I held up a neck massager to my breasts, and there were two rotating cones. I was like, "Bernard, Bernard, Bernard. I'm a prostitute robot from the future." Now fast-forward to Tallinn Airport security. I'm putting my items through the scanner, the Eye of Sauron as I call it. And the guard fixed me with a gimlet eye, and he nudged his mate, and he went, yeah, mumbling something in what I assumed was Estonian. He turned to me and he went, "Bernard, Bernard, Bernard, Bernard, Bernard." He went, "Bernard, Bernard, Bernard." Now... I knew what he meant, but it freaked all the other passengers out like you wouldn't believe. They all thought it was some weird Estonian folk greeting. And then of course we had to take the obligatory selfie. Now I'm fine with that. I accept social media into my life, albeit grudgingly, because if you're in the public eye, like what I am, you have to have a social media presence, otherwise some other nerk will rob it off you, all right? As I discovered when I went on Twitter, and there were four other Bill Bailey Twitter users pretending to be me, having a much more fulfilling life, which is really galling. It's extraordinary. Facebook is like the Death Star. It sucks us in with those tempting links. Protractor beam of Facebook. Oh, look at this link, oh, I must resist. But, no, look at it. It's so tempting. When this guy put some bread in a toaster, you won't believe what happened next. What happened, what happened, what happened? You will believe what happened next. And... and YouTube, it's just like a portal for the deranged. It's like a... it's like a sump from a vast underground lake of anger. I put a still photograph of a cabbage on YouTube to see what would happen. The amount of hatred that came back my way. What did you do that for? You stupid man! You stupid cabbage man. It's a cabbage, isn't it? Being online is very dangerous, you know. Being online we're at risk from cybercrime. My email was hacked. Some hackers got in. They guessed "bill123" and they got in. And they emailed my accountant. Now some of you are thinking, "You haven't got an accountant, Bill. You keep all your money in a tree stump in the woods, and every midsummer's eve you ask the wise old stag of the forest to tap out where I should invest it." But, no, I actually have got an accountant. Well, I did have and they emailed her, and asked her to transfer some money to an account in Turkey. A place I've never been. Showed no interest. And she bloody did! She just handed it over! Now what really annoyed me was the language that they used was so clearly not me. Hurry up. Where is money? Send money now, Julie, for Turkey house. Did she think, "Bill's a bit grumpy today. He's lost his grip of grammatic structure"? And then they used a load of baffling emojis. Things I would never use. "Hurry up, Julie. Where is money?" Pony, pony, pony, cricket bat, sad face, cable car. But we have to accept technology into our lives. There's nowhere back. Umm, I-I'm going to make an assumption here, Hammersmith. I'm gonna guess everyone here's got a smartphone, and, uh, everyone's got their own ringtones. Umm, but here's a way... Here's a thing you can do. Uh, you can make your own ringtones. Umm, you can make them out of any everyday household object, like this hand-carved African log drum. Perhaps like a messaging tone. Something like that, or perhaps a WhatsApp. Or perhaps a longer personalized ringtone for a family member. Hello? You know... Something of that nature. And what you can do, I'm just gonna demonstrate now how you can create a very simple, working everyday ringtone. Right, so that's it. Recorded. Now here it is sampled over here. And you can improve it with a bit of a musical counterpoint like this. Here comes the ringtone. Or if you prefer, you can layer the ringtones into a kind of ringtone symphony, like this. Uno, dos, tres, cuatro! A sitar solo. Something like that. You never see any Satanists playing log drums though, do you? ♪ Satan is coming for your eyes ♪ You never hear that. Now... I'll tell you what really annoys me, apart from taramasalata and bad manners, and that is... the constant pressure to upgrade. Not just technology, but our lives generally. Every time you open a paper, or a magazine, there's some article exhorting you to live a better life. Ten super foods you should be eating right now. Ten places you should have gone. You've been looking out the window wrong your whole life. And really I was disturbed recently by one. It said, "I'd been eating biscuits the wrong way up my whole life." Right, now does anyone here eat chocolate Digestive biscuits? You, sir. Do you? When you eat them, when the chocolate goes in your mouth, - it's on the top, right? - Yeah. So the chocolate goes in on the top, the writing's on the bottom. But when you eat the plain Digestive, where's the writing? It's on the top. That's how we should be eating them. We've been eating chocolate Digestives upside down our whole lives. I'm clearly more freaked out by this than you are. It's just part of this pressure to improve our lives. I get this all the time, and you can't withhold. Eventually, you succumb. Friends were telling me, "Bill, you look a bit stressed. You need to get a massage." And I hate massage. I'm covered in hair. I feel like a dog being groomed. But... I say, "All right, I'll go along with this." So eventually I went to get a massage, you know. Not a, you know... I mean a... A legitimate one. Not a, you know... I don't know what that is actually. That's just a weird gesture. There you go, mate. It's like a cockney drive-by massage. There you go, mate. Have some of that. There you go. That'll sort your chakras out. No. Ooh, double-bubble. And, uh... I went to a spa, you know, like a tosser, and, uh... I got undressed, put the robe on, put the little hairnet thing on like that. I'm waiting for the masseur, and she comes in the room, and the first thing she did was this... Which is not a good start for any sort of social interaction. That. It turns out it wasn't a hairnet, it was disposable underpants, right. I don't know. I just put them on. And I actually thought, "These are really comfortable. There's two holes for your ears. This is brilliant." And while I was waiting I had teased all my hair out through the holes. I looked like Princess Leia's wizard uncle, you know. But happiness is now no longer a thing, which may happen to us, you know, and that's the thing, that's where it's leading all of this. The end point of Western civilization is to be happy. Happiness. And happiness is now no longer just a random thing, which may or may not happen to us if we're lucky. It's a quantifiable resource. It's a currency. I flew to Copenhagen. I came out of the airport, there was a sign saying, "Welcome to Denmark, the happiest country in the world." Now I've been to Denmark, it's nice, but people are not congoing down the street going, We all live in Denmark, we all live.. Wearing a cape, made out of bacon, and a pastry hat, which is obviously what I'd do. And the reason for that is that Denmark has got great social provision. It's got, you know, good healthcare and great education and the roads are nice, and everything's nice. But that doesn't necessarily equate to happiness. To me, happiness is more elusive, it's more mercurial, it's subjective. It could be anything - birdsong, a funny-shaped cloud. Finding a valid receipt for a faulty domestic appliance. Ah-ah-ah-ah. That is like the universe shining on you for a day. There. Because if you've tried to take a toaster back without a receipt, - that is a walk of shame. I've tried that, you walk in, "Uh, I'd like to return this toaster, please." "Do you have a receipt?" "Uh, no, but I did have one, and I bought it here, well, not here, another shop. It doesn't matter because I bought things, and I bought a toaster, and I like toast. I like to butter toast. Yum, yum, yum." And you're making no sense. Then you start babbling like an African prince, who has promised me £5 million, if we email him some toast. I'll cut you in on the deal. And then they realize you haven't got a receipt, and this must give them a mild sexual thrill I think. "Well, I'm terribly sorry, sir, if you don't... have... a valid receipt..." But if you do have a receipt, oh, what a beautiful thing that is. Oh, frabjousday. "Do you have a receipt?" "Yes, I do. Ooh, look, I've laminated it for my pleasure." "I'm looking at you through it." Pa-ding! Such a glorious reveal that is. I sometimes delay the pleasure of that by pretending I don't actually have a receipt. "Do you have a receipt?" "No, a kestrel snatched it from my grasp seconds ago, but I need this cordless kettle because I have a rare condition, where my knees need to be immersed in boiling water all the time. I need... Then you turn away all broken and go, "Wait a minute. What's this?" 'Cause that is happiness right there. What the Danes have is something else. That is contentment. Contentment is knowing that you're right. Happiness is knowing that someone else is wrong. Namaste. Tiny little things make us happy. For me, it's schadenfreude. The vicarious pleasure of watching popstars humiliated. That's all it is. When Justin Bieber fell down the trapdoor. Whoo-hoo! Yeah? I wanna see more of that. I wanna see Kanye West step on a rake, right. Nothing life-threatening, just annoying. Dang! Elton John gets his hand stuck in a teapot. That's all I want. Somebody's told him there's a Fabergé egg in there, and he's gone in after it with his pudgy little pub-piano playing fingers. The preposterous, pompous, wiggy little berk that he is. Don't know where that came from. Uh... Don't mean it in a bad way. Now I've written a song for Adele. And it's called You Left Me, But I'm Not Gonna Go On About it. ♪ I met you down on the street ♪ ♪ And you said that there was someone you were on your way to meet ♪ ♪ And I knew it couldn't be me ♪ ♪ Because I was the one that was there ♪ ♪ I stood for many hours crying outside your door ♪ ♪ Because I knew that our love our love was no more ♪ ♪ And I said why, why, why, why, why ♪ ♪ Why, why, why, why, why, why, why why, why ♪ ♪ Why did you leave ♪ Why did you leave me ♪ Why did you leave me ♪ Why did you leave me ♪ Why why did you leave me ♪ You, yes, you Why did you leave me ♪ ♪ But I'm not gonna go on about it ♪ It goes on like that. I wrote a song for Coldplay, as well. It goes like this, uh, "things will probably work out all right. Who-oa-oa-ah!" Seems to sum up their miserable oeuvre,doesn't it? Mumford and Son's album. Uh... You see... British happiness is different from happiness around the world because we process happiness in a different way in Britain. American friends I've met, Australians, they're much more in the moment. Oh, yeah! They're in tonight! Whoo-hoo! They're much more, much more upbeat, much more positive. I say to my Australian friends, "How are you?" "Awesome, awesome!" I mean, genuinely in a non-ironic way. "How are you? How was yesterday?" "Awesome, mate! Today's gonna be awesome." "What are you doing tomorrow?" "I don't know. Picking up stones in the rain. It's gonna be awesome." We never say that in a non-ironic way. In Britain, the best you're gonna get... Because our happiness is based on this premise: things could have been a lot worse. All right? That's as good as it gets in Britain. That's why the standard greeting in Britain... "How are you?" "Not too bad." That's as good as it gets in Old Blighty. "Not too bad." Things are clearly bad, but they're not quite as bad as we thought they were gonna be. We've dialed down our expectation to an acceptable level of disappointment. We're eking out our expectation in diminishing increments of reduced joy. Things are not too bad. There's the abyss. We're not in the abyss, we're in the car park and snack area adjacent to the abyss. It's not too bad. That is the ludicrous optimism of the British psyche. In Britain we have the highest per-capita ownership of convertible cars in Europe. That is preposterous optimism, right there. When you see a couple with the top down in July, their faces contorted in a rictus of optimism, as the horizontal hail drills into their retinas... "It's clearing up, it's clearing up." My own mother, God rest her soul, one of the greatest optimists I ever knew. At the end-of-term school play... I was in it, obviously. It was The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui by Bertolt Brecht. Some of you will know it. Yeah, we had quite an ambitious English teacher and... For those of you that don't know, it's a play. It's about the rise of gangsterism in Prohibition era Chicago. But it's a thinly veiled satirical allegory about the rise of Nazism, the thuggishness, the brutality and the inexorable rise of Hitler. A lot of parents were expecting the Nativity. Oh, they've reworked this. They've done the baby Jesus up as Hitler. Naturally, I was the lead. I was the Ui character, the putative Hitler character, so to go that extra mile, I dyed my hair black, cut it short, and combed it to the side. I came back from the hairdresser's, and I walked in and my mum went, "Oh, my goodness. You look lovely." I said, "Mum, I'm supposed to be Hitler." And she goes, "I don't care. You look very smart." And I didn't know it at the time, but that was the high watermark of her approval of my appearance. The Hitler Christmas. The Hitmas. See, one of the jobs as a comic, you have to listen in sometimes to the idiosyncratic way in which people talk. Sometimes you hope to get a glimpse of the zeitgeist. Sometimes you don't get that. I was in a pub in North Devon. I overheard two blokes talking, and one said to the other one, "You heard about that Eric Beaumont? He's in a right state." "Why's that?" "He entered the North Devon vegetables that look like celebrity competition." "Oh, yeah." "Here... he had a piece of root ginger looked like Sandra Bullock." "Oh, yeah?" "Yeah." "Sellotaped it to the wheel of that coach like in Speed." "Yeah, lovely job, lovely job." "He's been disqualified." "'Cause it didn't look like Sandra Bullock?" "No, 'cause technically ginger's a fruit." "Oh, right." So... That's ten minutes of my life I'm never getting back, you know. I was outside my own house here in Hammersmith where I live, keeping it real on the west side. And... - Yes! And, uh, I was walking up and down my street, not walking up and down like a distressed polar bear, I was just walking, looking up there, what's up here oh, that's changed, isn't it? And, uh... Oh, bloody developers. Oh, yeah. Oh, ooh, a Costa, oh, and, uh... That's evil. The evil of Costa. So that's another show. And, uh... So I'm walking up and down my street, and I overhear two women talking, and I naturally, I instinctively listen in on their conversation. I catch the end of the conversation, and one says to the other, "There's that puddle I was telling you about." You see, the thing is I think that's just transference. I think people wanna talk to each other in Britain, but we can't. We're incapable of saying nice things. Other people, other races are able to do that. I walked the Ridgeway last year. It's a beautiful walk, and when you walk outdoors sometimes strangers accompany you for a portion of the walk, and there's this wonderful American couple join us. Really positive, upbeat, totally, uh, you know... very kind of full of life. As they were walking they kept up this commentary about what a great time they were having. "This is a great walk. What a fantastic idea this is. Thanks for inviting me." "Why, you're welcome. What a great idea. I'm so glad we're walking on this path. What a terrific path. Look at that view. I'm having a great time. Shall we have lunch?" "Yes, let's have some lunch. What a great idea." On and on and on. It was weird and charming, I guess. And, but... All of us Brits, we're incapable of doing that. We'd love to be able to say that, we'd love to be able to say, "You are my fond companion. I like walking with you." But we can't. It comes out in a different way. It comes out like this, "Whose idea was this. How much further?" And the "not too bad", that's just like a... It's like another daily greeting. Somebody goes out in the week. "How was last night?" "How was the night out?" "Oh, not too bad." But if you haven't seen someone in a while, you get a bit more, you get a bit, you get a bit extra. You say, "I haven't seen you in ages. How are you?" Not too bad, all things considered. When people say that to me, I want to say to them, "You have considered all things?" Uluru, the Okavango Delta, The Cradle of all Life, the Alps, the genius of Mozart, the limpid minimalism of Arvo Paärt? The unplayable piano music of Franz Liszt, whose giant manatee-like flipper hands means that if you're not a circus freak or a yeti, you can't actually play the bloody stuff? The tectonic plates inching around the planet, mocking our brief dance on the surface? Those yogurts with a bit of fruit in the corner? All human artistic endeavor? Everything that has ever existed at a molecular level? Pushing somebody in a pond when they least expect it? Sitting around the house in your pants eating gluten for a laugh? Wars, religion, ideology, a rose, opening up a new jar of instant coffee with the back end of a teaspoon? The sensation of that! The baffling longevity of LinkedIn? Standing on the Rialto Bridge at midnight covered in Marmite, naked, chucking wine gums at tourists shouting, "I forgive you"? The uncountable stars, the boundless universe, beyond which our imagination founders on a distant shore, where we dare to touch the hem of infinity's cloak? You considered the opalescence that shimmers on the surface of a tear, that wells up in the shepherd's eye, as he... as he marvels at the beauty of yet another Patagonian sunrise? "You considered that?" "Yeah." "And how do you feel?" "Not too bad." OK, it's time for a couple of poems. Uh, I use the syllabic structure of the football formation: four, four, two. This is called Love Gone Wrong. "I held you close, you looked morose, dead wasp." And this next poem is a five-lined high coup, a cinquain if you will. And in it I tried to sum up what it is to live in the West. We see such chaos and destruction enter our lives through the TV. We feel upset by it, but we can't be upset all the time otherwise we'd never take the bins out. So we have to distract ourselves with the mundane, the sensual, the quotidien. This is the paradox of Western existence. "In this mad world spun fast For nothing lives fly past Helplessly we look on aghast. Ooh, cake!" When I was a kid, when I was learning the piano, I always preferred the minor keys. The major key was always associated with happiness. But I preferred the more melancholy minor key, the beautiful minor scales, like the melodic minor. That hopeful ascent and depressing descent. ♪ Things are looking happy and joyful ♪ ♪ No, they're not they're depressing and bleak ♪ And the wonderful harmonic minor with that Eastern figure at the end. It's impossible to play that without playing it like this. That's why... I failed my Grade Three. I'm in a social situation, people say, "It's someone's birthday. Will you play the piano?" And I say, "I will." "Will you play Happy Birthday?" I say, "I'll do it in the minor key." Then I go a bit Liszt. Bit cabaret. I've rewritten the lyrics to Happy Birthday because I think Happy Birthday is a bit of a dirge, so... It's also too unrealistic. This is more downbeat and realistic. This is Happy Birthdayin the style of the 1930s Berlin Cabaret. In a Kurt Weill birthday if you will. ♪ Happy birthday ♪ Happy birthday ♪ What a rhapsody of fear ♪ Let's strum the harp of pointlessness ♪ ♪ You've survived another year ♪ ♪ Each little candle ♪ A tiny death knell ♪ A snickering footman ♪ A tolling bell ♪ One for deception and one for a crime ♪ ♪ And one for a dream extinguished by time ♪ ♪ Our lives a brief shuffle down the gangplank of pain ♪ ♪ To adjust an old sponge cake ♪ ♪ Left out in the rain ♪ Stumbling to oblivion ♪ From embryo to ghost ♪ So let's charge our dirty glasses ♪ ♪ And raise a futile toast to you ♪ ♪ And your meaningless milestone of decay ♪ ♪ Happy birthday ♪ Happy birthday ♪ Like anybody cares ♪ It's a lie, it's a lie it's a lie, it's a lie ♪ ♪ It's a cake in the shape of a lie ♪ ♪ Why use that knife to cut the cake ♪ ♪ Why, here's the reaper's scythe ♪ ♪ Happy birthday cheeky chops ♪ ♪ It's not every day you're five ♪ Thank you very much!

You're a punk band, and you... Argh! Right. - What's the name of your band, sir? - Death Star. Death Star. - I like it. And is it sort of quite fast and furious? - No. - No. - It's slow punk. Hmm. ♪ Smash the system from within ♪ ♪ For that is the only true way ♪ Sorry. It's gone medieval. Medieval punk. - Hmm. ♪ Smash the system from within ♪ ♪ And then we'll take the wolves to the tower ♪ Sorry. I got a bit distracted there. Uh... - And do you play an instrument, sir? - Guitar. Guitar! Right on. And when you're, when you're playing with Death Star, when you're rocking out, do you feel transported by the power of music? Yeah? Yeah, yeah. So... Well, that was a long walk down a windy beach to a café that was closed. So... I don't mean that in a bad way. It's not like they're recording it for a DVD or anything. Any metal fans in? - Yes. 'Course there are. Uh, I like a bit... All kinds of metal. Anyone play in a metal band? - MAN 2: Yeah! - Yes! Excellent. And what... what is the name of your band, sir? - WKD. - Pardon? - WKD. - WKD. Wicked. Have you looked at the bottle you're drinking and gone, "Good name."? And are you...? What kind of metal do you play? - Thrash. - Thrash. Right, that's one of the best, one of the most aggressive forms of metal. Uh... There's, uh, there's death metal, and death metal, again, very aggressive form of metal, and there's certain sort of protocols we have to follow, like there's two singing styles, there's the growling style, roo-roo, and the screaming style, agghhh! And there's a chord progression, very popular in death metal, which is this. Which I think is the only chord progression in death metal. And you add that to the singing style, roo-roo, oh-ooh-oh-ohh-oh. That's a death-metal rowing team. Oh-uh-oh-uh-oh-uh. Which I would bloody love to see, I have to say. Oxford and Cambridge rowing along sedately, and then a long black boat pulls up alongside. Oh-uh-oh-uh. All Viking helmets chucking goat carcasses at them. Oh-uh. Oh, make that happen, someone. - Umm... I've got this theory that most songs in the popular canon will be improved by playing them in the death-metal style. So if you'd like to suggest a few songs, I will endeavor to do that. MAN 3: Justin Bieber. Justin Bieber. Not Justin Bieber. That's the only one that doesn't work weirdly. - What was it? - MAN 4: Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star. Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star. All right, then. ♪ Twinkle, twinkle, little star ♪ ♪ How I wonder what you are ♪ Up above the world so bright ♪ ♪ Like a diamond in the night ♪ Twinkle, twinkle, little star how I wonder what you are ♪ ♪ Twinkle, twinkle, little star ♪ ♪ Twinkle, twinkle, little star ♪ ♪ How I wonder what you are Very good. Thank you. Well done. Well done. Good suggestions. Now along with metal, I like bird watching, right. Not at the same time. That would be weird. Oh-uh... Ooh. Satan. A chaffinch. - And, umm... But when we travel we always have a kind of visual idea about what it will be like when we get there. And I had this very clearly in my mind, when I took my whole family to see the Northern Lights, and it was a beautiful image. We were all bundled up in the cold drinking cocoa, looking at this marvelous, natural phenomenon. That resolutely did not happen, right. We went to Tromsoø in northern Norway, in the Arctic Circle. I don't know if you've ever been to the Arctic Circle, but it is nippy. And I mean that seems an obvious thing to say, but, I mean, it is properly nippy. It's not just, "Oh, I might throw a pashmina over myself." No. It's "argh!" Your eyes freeze, and you forget your own name, and you have to put on all the clothes you've ever owned in your life. And then another suit, and then more and more suits. I had more suits than you can imagine, and pour soup into each layer. And you just... And also... this is my idea by the way. I had this idea that we would dog-sled under the stars to see the Northern Lights, not just passively enjoy it from a hotel balcony or a cruise ship. No, we were gonna dog-sled through a forest, across a glacier, and thus see the Northern Lights. What could go wrong with that scenario? And, ahem, we arrived at the dog-sledding place. The dogs looked existentially furious with everyone around. This is not a good start. The sledge looked like something I'd made coming back from the pub. Couple of deck chairs, bit of carpet, brilliant! The guide just looked bored with the whole thing. He was the security chap, the safety talk. He was wearing animal skins. Clearly, some of them just recently been killed, you know. And... He looked bored and stoned in equal measure. And the sledge had a braking system. It was just a metal bar with teeth in it and he just said, right, he goes, "Right, to stop it, you just press that." Good luck. And... So we all got on these sledges. Me, my wife, our son, my dad, my wife's parents. We all got on sledges, and headed off into the darkness. And within seconds I realized this was a terrible idea. It was so fast, terrifyingly fast. We got on the sledges. I was all ready to go. Really excited. "Ooh, this looks great." So here we go. Argh! God! We just shot off, and low branches whipping over my head. Argh! Argh! Jesus! And even if it hadn't been totally overcast, there's no way you could have leaned back to look at the Northern Lights without fear of instant decapitation. The next thing I found out was that the dogs, right, they don't pull you up a hill. The slightest incline they just stop, right. They weren't having it. This, this... A millimeter up like that, and they go, "Ugh, we can't..." And then the one at the back would just look back at you, like all sort of contemptuous, like, "We're not pulling you up there." Hmm. So you had to get off the sledge, and walk behind, until you reach the level area, and then jump back on the sledge, right, fine. Uh, within minutes of leaving the dog base, there was also, there was a tremendous kerfuffle. Two nurses from Prestatyn were catapulted into a crevasse. Started screaming uncontrollably in a darkened wood. I don't know if you've been on holiday when people scream uncontrollably in a darkened wood, but it puts a real downer on the whole thing. And they were scooped up, put on a snow mobile, taken back to base. And as they were going past, they were going, "Go back. It's terrifying." You don't wanna hear that on your holidays, right. Anyway, so then this is what happened, right. My wife's parents, they were a team. Anne, uh, she's a tiny petite birdlike woman. She was the passenger and her husband Peter was driving the sledge. A larger, uh, quite a-a-a sort of a heavyset man. Quite a fit man in his early days. A hill walker. A mountaineer. Now reaction time, not quite what it was as a younger man, and quite a big weight differential between the two. Quite important later on. So... Peter was on an uphill section, and quite rightly he was behind the sledge walking, and then for some reason the dogs were spooked, and they just took off, and he didn't quite make it onto the sledge. So now he was running behind the sledge and Anne telling him, "Peter, you have to jump on." "I can't jump on. I'm just going to run behind." "No, Peter, you have to jump on." I can't jump on. I'm just gonna run behind. I'll catch up. For about a quarter of a mile he ran behind the sledge till eventually the cold caught up with him. He started to falter a bit and his leg went down. He was down on one knee and now he was on two knees being pulled along. Whoa, whoa, whoa. And gradually he held on. Clung onto the sledge until he was being pulled along on his chin. Argh, argh, argh, argh, argh! "Peter, don't let go." "I can't hold on, Anne. I think I'm gonna have to let go." "Darling!" "I'm gonna let go." He let go. Zoom! Gone. Vanished in the arctic night. The end! No. - And... We were oblivious to all of this. We were at the front of this caravan of doom. I remember saying to my wife, "Everyone's having a great time." Just as I said that Anne came hurtling out of the darkness. No driver on the back. Out of control. Screaming. I don't know if you've got in-laws, but it's unusual to see them in that state. It's... It's unnerving, you know. It's surreal, you know. You don't quite know what to make of it. Whoa. It's so different to how you normally see them, which is quite sedate. When you go round their house and you go, "Hello. Do you want a cup of tea?" "How was the trip? "Oh, not too bad." "What was the.... what was the journey like?" And then you have the route conversation. "Well, we went on the A4792." "Oh, the A4792. Well, normally you go the B4793." "Well, normally we go the B4793, but this year we went the A4792." "What was it, the satnav?" "The bloody satnav." "Took us round the bloody..." "Let's have a look at the map." "So you went on the A4792..." On and on. We have these conversations for years of our lives. Nobody's listening anymore. I've been making them up for years. "Which way did you come?" "We tunneled out the house. Let ourselves in through the back door." "We were fired out of a cannon. We landed in next door's garden. We've been passing ourselves off as Belgian diplomats for six years. Madam and Monsieur Bertrand. We've been living in the attic. We come down every night on a pole." "The front pole or the back pole?" "Oh, the back pole. We come in. We were beamed here. We got a lift with camels. W-W-We hitchhiked. We got a lift here with the Banana Splits. Snorky done a load of crystal meth. Smashed into a lamppost. The point is... Such a surreal sight it was when I saw Anne that my first reaction was not the correct one. It should have been. "Oh, my God. Let me help you." But no, it was this. "Wow." I've never seen her make that noise. Then a second later an even worse thought entered my head which was, "That's actually quite funny." Right. And then the correct thought which was, "Oh, my God. Let me help you." So I leapt onto the sledge and brought it under control and uh... 'Cause, I mean, the machine was caning it. She was absolutely barreling along. The dogs without the counterweight of Peter. There was no weight. The dogs thought they'd been given the night off. They were hammering along. It was like a Maserati pulling a Pringle, right. And I said, "Anne, where's Peter?" She looked at me with a mix of emotions, like one of them being, "You brought us here." And she spoke. I said, "Where's Peter?" And she spoke in this high-pitched querulous Welsh voice. I said, "Where's Peter?" She said, "I think he's died." OK. Terrible thoughts were entering my head. And they went, "Oh, my God. I'm responsible for a man's death." No, the thought in my head was, "I will never hear the end of this." Any documentary about the North Pole? Huh? Remember? Huh? A Fox's Glacier Mint. Anything could be a trigger. And then I heard his voice. Oh, he's fine. Thank God. He was just a bit shaken. So we did a head count to see if we're all here. I looked around. We're all OK. My dad's sledge had sort of veered off the path, and was now buried in a snow drift. He'd been there 20 minutes. It was -22. My dad, his circulation, not what it was. When I pulled him out I thought he's a goner. I've killed another one! They're dropping like flies. There was no movement on his face. It was just... Just his tongue coming in and out like this. He was hunched down like a little velociraptor, like this. I said, "Are you all right, Dad?" He just went, "Ooh." His whole face pulsating blue and green is the closest we got to the poxy Northern Lights. And... We got... we got home, and we discovered by some quirk of nature, the Northern Lights had been visible from Dagenham, right. I went for a drink with my neighbor and he said, "How was the trip?" I said, "Not too bad, all things considered." I met this girl when I was 19. I thought she was the one. Then she said something a bit weird and I thought, "Maybe not". Because love's strange like that. It's fickle. It's mysterious. You meet someone, you think you're getting on great, and they say something a bit odd, a bit culturally inappropriate, and you think, "This is not gonna work out." Like, you're getting on great, and then they'll say, "Hey, I've got us some tickets to see James Blunt in concert." And at that point you can just go, "This isn't working out" and walk away. Or sometimes you're talking to someone long into the night, and something monstrous is revealed about them. You'll say things like, "I like running into the sea naked at midnight." "Yeah, I like doing that." "Tell you what I don't like. Taramasalata." "No, I don't like that, either." "I love staying up late at night watching old movies. I love doing that." "Tell you what I don't like. The Jews." OK. I've just gotta pop to the shops for the rest of my life. See... When men and women get together in a heterosexual context that's dotting the sexual i's and crossing the t's there, women demand more of men, you know. They wanna know more. They wanna know what's going on. Uh, they wanna ask questions. Umm, men we're a bit more simplistic. We've figured out our role in life a long time ago, which is basically carry stuff, try not to get in the way and then we die. - But... I mean... There's a bit more to it than that. That's the bare bones of it. Women want a bit more. When they meet a man they've invested time in him. They wanna know more, so they ask him this question, "What are you thinking? What are you thinking?" It's very important. Women have a greater emotional articulacy than men. They want to know what's going on. And when they see a man gazing off into the middle distance, a wistful look on his face, they mistake that for intelligence. And... Deep philosophical thought. Wow, he's grappling with the problems of the age. Nope. When we're gazing off like that, we've gone into a power-saving mode. "What are you thinking?" "Hmm. Nothing. Literally nothing. A spinning wheel at best." Women are quite persistent, "What are you thinking?" It will shake a bloke out of his reverie. And blokes are quite good at cobbling together something under pressure. "What are you thinking?" "Uh... just thinking... how compatible we are." "Aw, that's sweet." "Phew! Got away with it." I've been with my wife a long time, many, many years, and we have a great relationship, we've moved on. We don't ask ourselves what we're thinking anymore. We don't need to. We're very honest with each other. In fact, if you're very honest with someone, you don't wanna know what they're thinking all the time. It would lead to some awkward exchanges. We might be looking at a sunset. She might say, "What are you thinking?" And I'd have to say, "I'm thinking about a sandwich I had in 1984." We're sitting at the kitchen table, ostensibly going through the accounts, and I'm nodding like I'm listening. "Yeah. Mm. Oh, yeah. Uh-huh." But actually what I'm thinking is, "If I had a long, thin, bendy neck, I could see what's under the fridge." We're doing the washing-up, and I'm drying a plate, and I'm stuck drying this plate. Sometimes you stare at the plate, and she'll say, "What are you thinking?" I'm thinking, "Could I wrestle a Frisbee off a panther?" That's what I'm thinking right now. Just give it here! Or we're having a romantic dinner. She reaches across the table, "What are you thinking?" "Honestly, what I'm thinking? I'm thinking if I lie down next to the bathroom scales, could I weigh my own head?" You're laughing now. You'll be trying that later on. So anyway I met this girl, right. I was 19. What do you know? Your head's full of sparkles. And I bought a bag of cookies from this new cookie store in town, and I turned up, and I said, "Oh, hi. I've got these cookies." And she opened the door, and I was momentarily transfixed. I thought, "Wow, she might be the one. This might be it." And she smiled and took a cookie, and I just... suddenly our lives sort of unfolded before me. I saw us running on a beach. I saw children. I saw a marriage. I saw a golden wedding anniversary where we run a dolphin sanctuary and we're punting off to the sunset as the dolphins form an honor guard. All of this happened in an instant, and she took a bite of a cookie, mmm, like that, and then a little crumb broke off the cookie, and she licked it back in a sensual way. Off her lip, not off her shoulder. I mean... Like that. She's not a lizard, right. Ah, unlucky in love again. Another lizard, Bill. I love you. Bleurgh! Anyway... And then fatefully she took the second bite, and this is what ended the relationship, stopped it in its tracks. This one word and it was a word that was meant to be endearing, but it was not. It was a hateful word to me. It was something evil. It was like all of Dan Brown's works boiled down into a single hateful word. And she took a bite, she looked at me and she said, "Yumbles! Yumbles!" And outwardly I smiled, but inwardly I was going, "No!" "Not yumbles!" The Caribbean dream evaporated in a minute. One minute I had a "ram" daiquiri in my hand, a rum daiquiri in my hand. A "ram" daiquiri is a completely different thing. It's a sheep! - Yeah! I had a rum daiquiri in my hand, warm wind in my hair, and then the next minute a corpse had washed up on the beach and it had my face and an eel slithered out of its mouth. Ugh! The sky went black with ravens. There was a rain of frogs and a beautiful woman went by on a jet ski, except it wasn't a beautiful woman, it was a goat in a shopping trolley eating a light bulb, and through mouthfuls of broken glass, the goat was bleating, "Yumbles, yumbles." So I looked at her for a minute, and I just said, "I don't like the Jews," and ran off. Now... I've written a musical based on the Terminatorfilms. In a dystopian future... two people, an unlikely love story, between a machine and a person is starting to unfold. FEMALE VOICE: All through the years I've come to rely on you, but this has blossomed into the fact that I have feelings for you. MALE VOICE: I cannot process feelings. FEMALE VOICE: I know. MALE VOICE: What is wrong with your eyes? FEMALE VOICE: I'm crying. MALE VOICE: Why do you cry? FEMALE VOICE: When it hurts. MALE VOICE: My sense is not detecting any physical impairment. FEMALE VOICE: Sometimes it hurts in the soul. MALE VOICE: I do not understand. MALE VOICE: I have been out into the wasteland. I went to the bombed-out supermarket. I got you some food. FEMALE VOICE: What did you get? MALE VOICE: Tinned peaches. I have not had them before. FEMALE VOICE: I have not seen them in a long time. Oh, my God. Tinned peaches. MALE VOICE: Let me open them for you. Bzz bzz bzz. Zzz, vvvv. I have an attachment. Bzzz. FEMALE VOICE: Yes, I can see. Oh, wow. Tinned peaches. I haven't tasted these in a long time. Mmm. Yumbles. FEMALE VOICE: Don't go! - Anyway... I went to see Sir Paul McCartney. Now we all know Beatles songs. We've grown up with them, we sing them and listen to them, but when you actually hear them being sung by a living Beatle, there's an emotional heft that I was not expecting. I thought this is extraordinary. These songs, they're more than songs. They're like memes. They're like threads in a cultural tapestry of memory. When I looked around thousands of people were lost in reverie, as they remembered the moment when they heard these beautiful songs. And I thought if ever I get to meet Paul McCartney I want to try and tell him, I want to try and say this, try and describe this experience because I bet no one's ever told him how brilliant he is over the years. I sort of thought, "These songs, they're enmeshed, you know, in the cultural consciousness," and I thought, it was quite arty, a bit pretentious this speech, but I thought it was well meaning. Anyway, suddenly the opportunity arose to meet Paul McCartney. Me and me mate Kev, a huge Beatles fan, we were invited backstage to meet Paul McCartney. So now I'm really excited. A bit nervous. I've gotta get this speech right. It's gonna be so great. So Paul McCartney, he comes out, and he looks round the room, and then he sees me and very briefly our eyes meet, and he looks at me, and he smiles and he leans forward, and he goes, "Bernard, Bernard, Bernard, Bernard." - He didn't do it. He didn't do that. - He didn't do that. He didn't do that. He didn't do that. He came over. He shook my hand. "Hey, nice to meet you, fellas." Then I thought, "This is it, Bill. This is it. You're up. You've got to get this right. There'll only be one opportunity." So I started the speech. It started well, "Sir Paul McCartney..." And then it went downhill really rapidly 'cause I was so nervous. I went, "Your songs, like, uh, with a tapestry and everything, like a thread with a culture and a black bird. See, l-l-like, like... I, a tapestry, when a goat, a kestrel sees a vole and you whoo." And it was just gibberish. Kev's looking at me like, "What the hell?" And I went, "I don't know what's going on." And then it just became sounds. La, la, la. Hmm, blackbird, tapestry. Ugh... And I thought, "I'm gonna have to bail out of this," so I just went, "And this is my mate, Kev." Paul McCartney turns to Kev and says, "Hey, Kev." And Kev meets his hero. He goes a little bit to pieces. He's like, "Oh!" And his leg starts to go a little bit. And he starts to do his low chuckle. And Paul McCartney's shaking his hand, and now Paul McCartney's shaking a little bit. Paul McCartney turns back to me, and for some reason now I'm doing this. Mang, mang, mang, mang, mang. I have no idea why. I think I was trying to reset my vocal ability, and I thought I was doing it in my head, but no, I was doing it out loud. Mang, mang, mang, mang, mang, mang. Mang, mang, mang, mang. I was like some drug-addled Pingu. Mang, mang, mang, mang. This is where we should have backed away. "Bye-bye, Paul McCartney. Bye-bye." But, no, it got so much worse. So much worse. Because then I thought, "I'm going in again. If it kills me, I'm gonna have another crack at this speech." So I start again, and I try and say, "Your songs are enmeshed in the cultural consciousness." But the word "enmeshed" gets stuck in the doorway of my brain, with another word, "entrenched". So this weird hybrid word comes out, and this is how I go, "Paul, Paul, Paul, your songs are enmenged. Umm... with everyone." And he looks at me and goes, "Enmenged?" And I forget where I am and who he is and the context of this conversation. So I just look at him and say, "What?" And he looks at me and goes, "What?" And then I say, "Enmenged," and he looks at me, and he goes, "Enmenged?" And I look at him and go, "What?" We're just trapped in this weird nexus of nonsense. "What? Enmenged?" "Enmenged? What?" "What?" "Enmenged?" This is not how I wanted this to turn out at all. It goes on for years and years. We grow long beards. "Enmenged." "Enmenged?" "What?" Finally Kev saves the day. He goes, "Great show." "Oh, thank God!" So they're getting on and Paul McCartney tells a joke and Kev's laughing, and I think I should now join in. I should now laugh but I don't trust what's coming out of my mouth. So I try a little test laugh a little bit to the side. But what actually comes out is like no laugh any human has ever laughed. Like a zombie horse with emphysema, trying to get his head in a tight jumper. It gets so much worse, it gets so much worse, because what happens, Paul McCartney then tells a story about going to see Tony Bennett in concert and I think, "I've been to see Tony Bennett in concert. This is my way back in." So I launch recklessly into this story. It's Glastonbury. It's the mud fest. The worst it's ever been. There's a lake of liquid mud in the dance tent. The blokes with the nozzles and the tractors they use to suck the crap out the toilets are brought into suck the mud out of the dance tent. Except something goes terribly wrong, and they end up pumping a load of shit into the dance tent. I don't think it was an accident. I think it was more a case of, "Here, dance in this, you trust-fund tossers." I'm just saying. Anyway, on the main stage was the incongruously dapper figure of Tony Bennett. Total mismatch with the audience who are all mud monkeys. Thousands of them just shuffling about in the trenches of the Somme. And Tony Bennett's got an immaculate Vegas showband. Na ba ba na ba, zabadoo bow! And all the mud monkeys are going... Tony Bennett appears on the back of the stage, and he's walking down the ramp, which is covered in liquid mud, and halfway down he slips. Whoo. And then he slips forward like this, and then he starts careening around the stage, as the band are going, "Am bam a na ba do..." And all the audience are going, "No, Tony Bennett! Don't fall!" Tony Bennett comes out and he goes, "Hey, what a night," like he's in Vegas, and not in a shitty field of mud at half-past two in the afternoon. - And... I try and tell this story to Paul McCartney. It doesn't come out right. This is how it comes out, "Paul, Paul, Paul! I've seen Tony Bennett." He went, "Whoa! Ha-ha-ha!" The final indignity was when we left. He turned away and he turned back to me and he went he goes, as an afterthought, he looked at me and he went, "I'll be watching you on the TV." And I turned to him and I went, "And I'll be watching you," and I poked him in the eye. He just leaned forward at the last minute. Whoa! My only hope is somewhere in the world tonight he's telling that story, and he gets to that bit and he goes, "And then one of the Hairy Bikers poked me in the eye." You've been a lovely crowd, Hammersmith! Thanks very much. One more? One more? Well, it's that time of night where I play an Irish reel upon the mandola. This is called Nana's Got No Gammon. Thank you, Hammersmith!
