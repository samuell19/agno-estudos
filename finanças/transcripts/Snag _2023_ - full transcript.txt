You left Australia because you were running away. Broken family? Maybe, but no, that's not it. Mmm. Oh. [laughs] To find yourself, or maybe to run away from yourself. Ay, but wherever you go, there you are. That's a bit cliché. Mm-hmm. Donde quiera que vaya, ahí estás. It sounds better in Spanish, verdad? Everything sounds better in Spanish. Mmm. You moved to America to find the American dream. And yet, you end up working as a drug mule for a Mexican drug cartel. And poof, there you are, standing in front of yourself again.

Start breaking down some physical walls. You know what I mean. If there's a spooky part, she reaches over, grabs my arm, rests her head on my shoulder. By scare three or four, that armrest is up, my arm is over her shoulder. You know what happens next. But she tells me she doesn't do horror movies. Or, like, she hasn't since she peed her pants when she was a kid. She doesn't like 'em. Perfect. I can be the hero. "Don't worry. You're safe with me. I got you, babe." [both] Sonny and Cher. Ugh. She likes me. She feels comfortable with me. She trusts me. So we go. The joke's on me. By the first scare, she digs her nails into my arm so badly I bleed. Scare two, she bit my shoulder with her mouth. Last scare, my arm is finally around her shoulder. She gets so fucking freaked out, back of her head bops up and hits me right in the jaw. My tooth is still loose. [giggles] What's funny? I think the girl's an easy mark. What do you mean? Like putting spiders in her bed or putting limbs in places like her drawers or something.

No, but when I saw la pistola, I stopped paying attention. Okay, Javi. I need you to listen to me very carefully. Okay? Are you parked out back? Always. Are you with Jackie? Claro, papi.

I have a family. I'm happy. I know the feeling. But then, I wouldn't even be here if it weren't for you. I'm gonna help you. But the minute your taillights are out of my sight...

How do you know her? I just know her. How? Like I fucking know her, Javi! I'm sorry. Look, I didn't mean for any of this. Man, I did good back there though, no? Yeah, mate. You did good. What! You don't fuck with Javier Manuel! Okay. Should I drive? No. Are you sure? I... Okay. [speaks Spanish] What is this? Where are we? My abuelito's old cow farm. It's off the grid.

It's a generator situation. Are you turning it on? One sec, man. I just got in. Can I put my shit down? [bag thuds] My shit's down. It's in the shed out back. I know you don't think I'm going out there in these shoes. I'll go with you. [Victoria] Jean-Pierre. I stepped in a pile of my own dog's shit today. Now I know my little Pepito would never shit where I was walking on purpose. So why am I stepping in shit? Don't we have someone for this? He's not doing his job, boss. No, he's not doing his job at all. Kill him. My little Pepito. I miss his face. He's a cute puppy, eh, boss? The cutest. [car door opens] [grunts] [chuckles] I heard you stepped in shit. Barefoot. Ooh. The worst. You have something for me? You don't need to count. I know. Do you remember when we first met? Yeah, of course. It's a shame. She was pretty. Very pretty, boss. [distant hawk screeching] [Jean-Pierre grunts] I wanted no survivors. And yet here you are. I made a call to a bar, my bar, right outside the border to intercept you... [grunting] That's a rough bar. I'm lucky Valentina was there. [horse neighing] She interfered with my business. She knows better. She's your daughter. The only reason she's still alive. Was it a coincidence that she was there? Maybe, but I don't think so. When it comes to you, I don't think there are coincidences. You got stabbed tonight. [Snag groans] Fuck! It's nothing. [laughs] Well, I bet that nothing only missed a vital organ by what? Mere centimeters. Anyone else would have probably bled out, but not you. No. You can shoot the boy. [gunfire] You can blow this boy up. Whew. Fuck. But he just won't die. Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you. Mmm. You're gonna break your daughter's heart. This gun left my daughter fatherless. Do you think that I can't kill some pretty-boy drug mule who has been nothing but a thorn in my fucking side? I'm not a drug mule anymore. Why do you think that is? Because I'm difficult to kill. And you would lose your best guy, which means you would lose your money. Your best quality. [laughs] I feel like you're getting a little cocky. And I feel like you're using my daughter as a shield. What do you think your life would be like if I decided to separate the two of you? I am going to marry Valentina, even if it kills me. I'd prefer to do it with your blessing. I've showed you my loyalty and I have proved to you that I will do anything for your daughter. We only have one more deal left on our agreement. And I hope that deal still stands. For all of our sakes. A threat? Ooh, no. Please. I would never threaten you. We're family, after all. That's a lot of guns. Gonna need 'em. Must've made a lot of mistakes. I only ever made one mistake. [gun cocking] I fell in love with the daughter of a very dangerous person. Falling in love, that doesn't sound like a mistake. That wasn't the mistake. The mistake was believing her mother. Victoria? She took everything from me. I'll head out with Marco in the morning. You and Jackie stay here and lay low for a while. I'm on the journey now, coz. Yeah. [speaks Spanish] Any other day, I would just be at the bar, slinging beers for people I don't want to know, who don't want to know me. But today, I'm on the run with my friend. For my friend. To rescue the love of his life. It's fucking-- It's romantic, man. Javi, this isn't-- And I'm the getaway driver! Papi, I get to be that guy. I never get to be that guy. So you're stuck with me. [sniffles] And I get the big one. [laughs] [Valentina] We have to leave tonight. It's already set. You think this is your last one? How many guns are you bringing? Going out with a bang. [in Spanish] [in English] She has an army. Why are you going alone? Because she's testing me. And if you fail? I'm tired of running, Valentina. If we run, she's just gonna find us. And if she doesn't, we'll still just be running. She won't let me go. A deal's a deal. And my mother is a liar. I will do anything to keep us together. Valentina, we don't-- we don't have any other options here. And if this works... she said she'd walk you down the aisle herself. If it doesn't work? [generator revving] [Marco groaning] [chuckles, coughs] It's like a chainsaw. Just pull harder. Oh, no, I know. I've-- I've-- I've used those for... other things. I'm not a lumberjack. Maybe the gas is old. What? You seem to know a lot about generators. I own a shitty bar in a small town. Power's always out. All right. [groaning] [generator revving] Oh, fuck! [speaks Spanish] So... who was that woman at the gas station? I have no idea. So how long you two known each other? Him? Oh, uh, we used to work together. Doing what? This and that. Mostly that? Mostly that. So... what happened? Our boss-- Victoria. Victoria. Yeah. She hated him. I mean, she hated everyone who worked for her, to be honest. Would punish us for stupid things. Make us clean up her dog's shit. Things like that. [chuckles] But not him. [chuckles] Oh, no. He was the fuckin' best. A beast. Also... impossible to kill. Like a fucking roach. And she hated that about him. She wanted him dead? Oh, since the moment she laid eyes on him. Yeah. So why didn't she do it? Someone was protecting him. Her daughter. Valentina. She loved him. And he loves her. "Loved"? Well, she doesn't know he's alive. And he didn't know she was alive until I showed up. So... why did you show up? I owe him. I said it was for the money, but I owe him. You know the dog shit duty? It was my turn one day, and I said, "No, fuck it. I'm not a fucking lackey. I'm a goddamn professional assassin." As you can imagine, that didn't sit well with her. Who did she send after me? The one person who could actually pull it off. Thing is, he didn't show. He took the money, took her daughter and they ran. And the fucked-up thing is that I would have done it. I would have taken the money and put a bullet in his head if she asked me to. That's why I showed up. I am alive because he has honor. And honor is something you show up for. You wanna try the genny one more time? Yes, I think I will. [clears throat] [grunts] [revving] Did I do it? [distant motorcycle revving] That wasn't the genny. Shit. How did they find us? We gotta go! We gotta go. [revving continues] What the fuck? Fuck. [shouting in Spanish] She found us. [Victoria in Spanish] [shouting in Spanish] [Snag] Marco! [brakes squealing] [guns cocking] Javi! Did you think I would miss my daughter's wedding? [speaks Spanish] Valentina. There's only one target that I have never hit. I'm begging you. [sniffles] [in Spanish] [in English] I love him. [exhales] [in Spanish] [in English] No, Mama. No, no, no, no, no, no! Valentina! [gunfire continues] You ready to be the guy, Javi? Yeah. [gunfire continues] [grunting] [gunfire] [grunting] [gunfire continues] [clicks] [groans] [gunfire continues] [shouting in Spanish] [grunts] [grunting] [grunting] [knives clanking] [both grunting] [panting] [gunshot] [choking] [choking] Who the fuck are you? [panting] [footsteps approaching] [gunshots] [panting] [grunts] Oh, fuck. [grunting] [Javi, weakly] Papi? Papi? Javi. No, no, no. You're all right. Papi. Shh. You're okay. You're okay. You're okay. You're okay, buddy. You're okay. Yeah, you're okay. I got to be that guy. [cries] I got to be that guy. You, uh-- You are that guy. Yeah. You're that guy. I'm that guy. I'm that guy. [groans] No. No, no. No. [grunting] [gunfire] [echoing] No! Stop! No! [shouts in Spanish] [gunshot] [screams] [screams] [sobs] No, no, no, no. [in Spanish] [grunting] [breathing heavily] [sobbing] No. [cries] [sobs] I didn't know. [sobbing] [phone ringing] [footsteps approaching] [door opens] [ringing continues] No. [ringing stops] Bueno. Sí. I'll check if he's still available. [in Spanish] [clears throat] [in English] Oh, you don't wanna talk? I get it. That's okay. Maybe you just listen then. Did you really think that you could get back to her? Did you really think I would let that happen? You were my big fish. And anyone who knows me knows I always catch my fish. But you refuse to die. And so my fish falls off the hook. And who catches my fish? My only daughter. The only person I love in this world besides myself. You can imagine the moral conundrum this puts me in. There are many things in this world that you can't control. Life. Death. And love. You fell in love with the wrong person. That is-- That is not your fault. No. What is your fault is that you were supposed to die the day that I found you. But you cheated. You ran. And because you cheated, my daughter was placed in the line of fire. Holy shit. This is like Romeo and Juliet. And we both know how that ends. I wanted to kill you for a long time. But what would my daughter think if I did that? I did make the order that got my daughter killed. But miracles, they happen. Some people get second chances and I'm getting mine. And I'm going to make sure that you never get yours. You will never hold her in your arms again. Or your son. My... My what? Oh. You didn't know. Why couldn't you just let us go? We were so close to a new life. A new life? My daughter's life was perfect before you came into it. She never needed anything from you and she never will again, and neither will my grandson. [cries] [in Spanish] [in English] Everyone around you dies, except you. And I think it is time for everyone around you to go into remission. [grunting] [in Spanish] No. [in English] You told me I just had to watch him. Please. [line disconnects] [in Spanish] [grunts] I don't want to do this. [grunts] But I owe her. I owe her a lot. [grunts] You know what it's like to owe her. And maybe one day, I'll be laying where you are, but not today. [grunts] I'm sorry. [in Spanish] [gunshot] [birds squawking] I love it here. It's where I feel happiest. Sitting here next to you. What is it? I don't know what's going to happen. We never know what's gonna happen. [in Spanish] [in English] Two worlds that collided. For a reason. And what's the reason? So that we could build a new world. A better one. And if it doesn't work? If we want it to, it will. I want it. Me too. What happens next? Now I take care of you. [electricity crackling] [gasps] [grunting] [Victoria] If any of your kangaroo bullshit comes back to bite you and my daughter is involved... well, I think we both know how that one ends, yeah? [electricity crackles] [rap song playing] [glass shatters] [song ends]
