As it will give them competition and ruin their business. -What are you saying? -I am not saying it. They called me up an hour ago. They said that I shouldn't release your film. So now what? Mr. Shukla, they are big producers and I am a small distributor. I can't fight with them being in the same business? I am sorry. I can't accept your film. -You know us. -Yes -You also know that our film is good. -Yes - Even then you aren't supporting us. Mr. Kapoor, I know you. I also know your film is good. But what can I do?

And why did Mr. Shukla sent you the notice? Mr. Shukla and I had a partnership deal for this project. Mr. Shukla will invest in this project. Planning, hard work and direction will be mine. We made the film. If I and Mr. Shukla have the differences Where the situation is that we can't work with each other Then I will return him money and film will be mine. If I don't pay him then he will give me my share of hard work He will compensate for my work And the film will belong to him. That's why he gave me One months time. Sir, why is Mr. Shukla is doing this? Please talk to him I don't know Dakshraj Productions have misguided and confused him completely. I feel he has sold himself to the Dakshraj Productions house. Sir, what will we do the next? We have one month in hand. Let us see what to do. First I will try to get the film. Sir, may I come in? -I saw your film. -Thank you It's a very nice film. I am interested to finance your film. Thank you, sir! -I am going out for a few days. -Right We will sign the agreement after I return. I will finance you. Sir, my partner has the rights. Do you anything as security which you can give us? Based on that we can finance you. Like gold, property, shares anything. I have a film and me. Sorry, It's company's policy. I cannot help you, sorry You, being a director talking foolishly. When you have no rights then Why will a financer, finance you film? Blue Ocean is releasing it You are talking foolishly again Did he gave you anything in writing? No No distributors gives anything in written He didn't gave anything in written, right? That's it Look Shyam, next time when you come to me Get a proper and reliable project. -Mustafa! -Yes, I am coming. I here. Hello! Greetings. No! No greetings today Please don't mind I came twice in a day to meet you. Firstly I met in you in the evening. And now when I am returning home. I thought of meeting you. Not just meet but talk to you. It's nice you are not doing anything now. I am not a superstar that I will say You must be very happy. I want to tell you that You are very sad Tell me one thing What lacked in my commitment? I wrote that story with so much of hard work. I took pains to search for a producer. I lost weight to gather actors, cast and crew. I didn't eat or sleep. I didn't bother about myself or relationships. I gave my all for this film. I took care of this film Like a child since 10 years But it's nothing for you You stopped my film from release. Earlier I though it was the distributor Between the film and theatre. No, I was wrong Now I believe you played the game. Why are you harassing me alone? The world contains 7500 crores people. And you know that I am better than those crores. Some say the hero is new. Some say there is no heroine. Some say the producer is new. Some say the director is new. Some say the film is low budget. Some say it's an over budget film. Some say add this and some say add that If this was not there Wouldn't I make another film? Shouldn't I ? Should I bury my creativity right here? Lord! I made this film with so much of hard work. Please get it release. Please! I beg of you! I will say this and leave. Alright, we will meet again soon. Hey wake up! Wake up, is this is the place to sleep? Dunk yard! Get up Go Please give me a cup of tea See my luck . Earlier I didn't get a film. When I got it and completed. It is not getting released. Don't be so disheartened. Some or the other will happen. What will happen? Tomorrow is the last day. Mr. Kapoor can't pay Mr. Shukla Mr. Shukla will get the film. And he won't let the film get released Mr. Kapoor is calling up? -Hello, Mr. Kapoor -Yes, Veer -Where are you? -Yes, sir. What is it? Do you know Saxena's office at Heera-Panna mall? Yes, sir Come there, I am waiting for you. I'll be there right away. Do you have to go? Yes, Mr. Kapoor called up. I need to go urgently. -Okay, you take care -Yes -See you -Bye Check the papers. We have to pay Mr. Shukla one crore Thank you. Can I leave? Sit down This is the power of attorney of the film For which I am nominating you. Henceforth you will take the decisions regarding film, instead of me. Sir, I can't understand anything Why are you doing this? I am going abroad. It may take longer to me to return. Right now, your fulfil your responsibility and Lawyer! -This is a cheque of one crore. -Right Give this cheque to Mr. Shukla, okay? Just follow the lawyer as he says to do. -Okay -Okay, sir When you get all the rights Then release the film with Blue Ocean. Vinita, say aloud. "Ramesh you won't know the worth of a pinch of Vermillion. Ramesh you won't know the worth of a pinch of Vermillion No, say it with feelings if you want to become an actress then show feelings. -Sir This is draft of the money of your film production which Mr. Kapoor has sent. -What is this?
