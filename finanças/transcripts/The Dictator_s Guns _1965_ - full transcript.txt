GUNS FOR THE DICTATOR Pepe! Pepe! A man's here to see the boat. I'm coming! I'm coming! You want to see the boat? Yes, it's for sale, isn't it? Yes, of course. Come on board. Captain? Cournot. French? Me know many French people. The American señora, she had lots of money, you know. I know. And what do you want to do with this boat, Captain? Go sailing. - There's petrol on board? - About 300 litres. - Captain, how are you doing? - I'm fine, thank you. - You came in this morning? - Yes. Sit down. Tell me about this boat... Did you see it? - Yes. - And what do you think of it? It's OK. A fine ketch. Built less than 10 years ago. Good. And the inside is classy enough? It could be. With small improvements. And as it is... is it ready to sail? It seems to be. The sails are as new. The hull seems in good condition. It would be necessary to have it checked on dry dock though. Yes, of course. By a specialist. What about the engine? 300 horsepower. Petrol. You'd rather have had fuel... - It's safer. - We'll change it. But the engine works? Very well. What about the price? Does it seem reasonable to you? Somewhat expensive. But we could try to bargain. 60,000$. But if you're in a hurry, it would be best to cable Mrs Osborne today. All right. Here's what we'll do... If that lady does not know that the buyer is a firm, it will be easier to bargain. I think it would be better if you were the one to send the cable. In any case, you're still going to Puerto Macao to have a look at the two other boats we've talked about. I don't want people saying that I'm flippant with my purchases. Especially when it concerns a 25 m. ketch. Let's see... Today is Tuesday. We can meet here on Friday afternoon. Is that OK with you? I'm taking the next flight to Kingston. We have a board meeting. I'll be back Friday at noon. By then, you'll have heard from Mrs... Mrs...? - Osborne. - Osborne. OK. - Captain Cournot? - Yes. Lieutenant Selajadra of the Police Department. - Can we talk for a few minutes? - Come in. - May I see your passport? - Sure. Here it is. - You came here three days ago? - Yes, on Tuesday. And you left the hotel yesterday and the day before. - Where were you? - In Puerto Macao. And what were you doing there? I went to see boats. - You were thinking of buying one? - Yes. And on Tuesday you were here? And you went to see a boat in Santa Madalena? Yes, the Dragoon. Why? - The Dragoon is missing. - Missing? Stolen. Tuesday night. - Stolen? - The caretaker told us you had stayed on board for more than five hours and that you had examined the boat from top to bottom. So what? Do you know to whom that boat belongs? Yes, a certain Mrs Osborne. - And the price she asked? - 80,000$. I sent her a telegram offering 60,000$. That's a lot of money. You could have paid that much? I was actually doing it for someone else, a firm... - What firm? - The Hendrix, Hollister and Dykes Lab. So it's safe to assume you had contact with someone from that firm. Yes. Hugo Hendrix. He is staying at the Columbus. In that case, you won't mind coming with us to that hotel, Captain? We'll be able to check all those details with Mr Hendrix. Of course. - Did you tell the owner? - Sí, she's coming today. - You say you sent her a telegram. - Yes, on Tuesday. But why you and not Hendrix? He'll explain himself. If she had known the buyer was a firm, the price would not have been the same. That's it. The Dragoon? I went fishing with poor Osborne. 2 years ago at least. So it was stolen... Too bad! We'd never seen that Hendrix here before. He came in Monday morning, spent the night and checked out... - On Tuesday, right? - Yes, señor Victor. At about 5. Without paying of course. Now I must leave you, gentlemen. The staff will answer any of your questions. So, Captain? What do you think of that? - He is a crook. - Of course. But the trouble is you still can be held responsible. Have you noticed anything? Nothing special. I brought him some cigars which he paid for. - He also asked for maps. - Maps? Maps of the Caribbean sea. And one of the Honduras coast, I think. - Nothing else? - No, sir. - Thank you. Why did he send you to check on the boat instead of doing it himself? - No idea. - It's a problem. Yes, a moment please. It's for you, Lieutenant. Yes? Yes. Very well. Very well. It was the airport. Mrs Osborne has just arrived. And she's never heard of you, Captain. Neither did she receive any telegrams. For how long have you known that Hendrix? I told you, I don't know him. - I've seen him twice. - But he did know you. How did he know your name? Did he draw it out of a hat? He told me a ship owner had given him my name. - What's that man's name? - I don't know. I didn't think of asking him then. - Many people know me. - It's true. I checked. But why you and not someone else? I was looking for work. I was available. It didn't seem strange. - You left your country six years ago. - Yes. - Trouble? - No. You were in charge of a shipbuilding yard in Port-au-Prince. - Yes. - You had an associate by the name of Sutter. - Yes. - But there was an accident and Sutter died. I suppose the shipbuilding yard was insured? - You collected the insurance. - But it was less than the losses. But that fire... How did it start? What has it got to do with this? Mrs Osborne has just phoned. She received your telegram after all. It arrived after she had left. Well, Captain, you're free to go. By the way, we've had news about the Dragoon. It was sighted near San Pedro by a cargo ship during the storm. According to the captain, it seemed to have problems. The cargo ship radioed an offer for help but they refused it. Of course. - Of course. - Good luck. - Hello? - Captain Cournot? - Yes. - Rae Osborne. I'm really sorry about this telegram. So am I. Can I see you? Yes, if you want to. When? As soon as possible. Can I come to your hotel? All right. Let's say... in 15 minutes. All right. I'm coming. Captain Cournot... - Where can we talk? - Over there. Excuse me. - What will you drink? - I don't know. Same as you. Two Cuba Libres. That man who wanted to buy the Dragoon... - What did he look like? - Hugo Hendrix? A nice fellow. The... polo-playing kind. What about the Dragoon. Is it a beautiful boat? You're asking me? You should know better than I. I went on board only once. When my husband bought it. Well, it was... it is a beautiful ketch. - Thank you. - Thank you. But after that storm... You think it could get through? If there was a good sailor on board, it did... Otherwise, I hope for you you're well insured. And if I wanted to find it? Find it? The sea is big, you know. And there are thieves on board. Even if you found it, what would you do? You won't call the cops in the middle of the sea. I want to know what happened to it. If it's still there or if it has sunk down. I spoke to the captain of the cargo ship last night. He told me where he saw the Dragoon. He's written it on the map. Close to the North Coast, near San Pedro. There. About 150 miles, south-east of your glass. If we rent a fast boat, we can find it. - You'd waste your time and your money. - Why? The Dragoon was sighted 24 hours ago. Now it can be anywhere within a radius of 150 miles. Do you know what it means? About half of France. - It's big... - Yeah, it is... So, it's impossible. With a boat, yes. But you could try with a plane. Of course, a plane. The best thing to do would be to go to Jamaica and start searching from there. I have a friend in Kingston who owns a taxi plane business. I can give you his address, if you want. I'd like you to help me find the Dragoon. - Me? - I'll pay you, and pay all the expenses. You're the only one who knows the boat. When the police contacted you, you were at home, in New York, weren't you? - Yes. - So you received my telegram on Tuesday. Yesterday you told the police you hadn't. And this morning you invented that story. You have your reasons. But when you lied to the cops, you made them go after me. And for them I still remain a suspect. And you want me to go looking for your boat. Mrs Osborne, Captain... The coast guard found something that may have to do with the Dragoon. Near the cove at San Benito. Can you come with us? - Of course. - You have your car, Captain? Please follow us. The guy who used you, Hugo Hendrix... I knew him. That's why I lied about the telegram. One, three bullets. The other, knifed. - The Benavides brothers. - Did you know them? - No. - Take them away. The bodies were thrown at sea. But the tide brought them back. A piece of a box. - Insulators. - Insulators. A .9mm insulator? Arms traffic. - Nothing else? - No, we're still looking. - Did you know the Dragoon was not insured? - No. Osborne's business wasn't going too well when he died. So if Mrs Osborne hired you, don't expect too much. He left her nothing except the boat. I think the investigation will end here. There's nothing more we can do. The Dragoon is not in our waters... Well, goodbye, Captain. The next plane for Kingston leaves in an hour. We can catch it, if we hurry. Jacques! What are you doing here? A seaplane? When do you want it? For how long? What do you want it for? Yes, of course. You have money for the petrol? It's right there. On the North Coast. Right there. Yes, but now it can be anywhere... I know, but Mrs Osborne wants to try. It's a big area! We'll have to search square after square. - It suits you? - Yes, fine. We can start searching. I've seen something! Over there! A cutter. There! A ketch! A big one. Is it the one? Can't say from here. No, it's not. Not the same rear deck. The Dragoon raft. The raft from the Dragoon has been found. Empty. - Where? - 12 miles from the Loggerhead reef. Yesterday night. By a fishing boat called Dorado. It came back less than an hour ago. South-west. 20 miles from here. We have enough to go and have a look. Keep the course. I think I see something straight ahead. A sand bar or a small reef. But there's a boat too. - That's it. - Are you sure? - Positive. It's grounded. There's no one. It seems abandoned. Could you fly over it once more? All right. But only once. All you have to do is go and get it. It's near the Loggerhead reef. Over the Narina shallows. About four miles from the west coast. A chartered boat will take two days. If we find one to sail on the shallows. You're sure you'll be able to land? If the sea is like today, it can be done. I've seen no reef. We'll have to get there early in the morning. At high tide. - Before the wind rises. - OK. The captain of Dorado is waiting for us at the port. Mrs Osborne, would you like to ride with me? It'll be more comfortable. What sort of a woman is this Mrs Osborne? I mean... Is she all right? We've searched around for about one hour. We found nothing. There was only one lifeboat on board? Yes, only one. You have to be crazy to sail in these seas in a storm. - What about swimming to shore? - 80 miles! - Impossible. - OK. - Many thanks. - Thank you, Captain. - Where's Mrs Osborne? - I dropped her in Macaraïbo. We'll go back to the plane. We'll fill her up and put a raft on board. We'll set out at 5:30. OK? OK. Well, everything's OK for you, Captain? - For me, yes. - Everything set and ready? Departure at dawn. Hendrix, Allister and Dyke Laboratory! Did he tell you he was a doctor? No. Why, was he? He was everything: doctor, professor, radiologist, cardiologist, psychologist... All the trades ending in gist. Give me a cigarette. - Is this important to you? - Important? No. What's important to a rich widow? - How old are you? - 43. You're not married? - I was. - Why did you leave your wife? We didn't get along. I'll tell you something, Captain. I'm not a rich widow. Oh well... Sit down. It would be best if you went on the west side to wait for us. How long do you think you'll stay? If there's not too much damage, I'll stay on board and take Mrs Osborne back in half an hour. If the radio's working, I'll call you. It must be three metres deep. I could bring it in this fairway. - You think it is possible? - I don't know. We'll see. Did you find something? Jacques? Hugo... I'm really sorry, Rae... I only wanted to borrow it. I would have brought it back. But things did not turn out as I thought they would... The storm... And my partners have ideas that are quite different from mine. Bad luck, you could say. No need to tell you that Morrison believes in using radical methods. You'll go up on the bridge so that the pilot may see you. You'll walk about and, when told, you'll start the engine. - And then? - Do as you've been told. After that, we'll tell you. Up you go. Now you'll talk to the pilot. - What do I tell him? - That everything's all right, that you'll sail back, the girl and you, and that he can leave. Dragoon calling Mac Allister 771. Dragoon calling Mac Allister 711. Over. Mac Allister 771 to Dragoon. You're coming through loud and clear. What's the situation like? Over. Very bad. We're stuck... Your transmitter has problems. I can't hear you any more. Mac Allister 771 calling Dragoon. I can't hear you. Mac Allister 771 calling Dragoon. I can't hear you. Dragoon calling Mac Allister 771. Over. Mac Allister 771 listening. What's going on? Over. Dragoon to Mac Allister 771. Nothing bad. No serious damage. I'll raise the boat. Over. Mac Allister 771 to Dragoon. Got it. You'll raise it. You're staying on the boat, the both of you? We're staying on board. We'll sail her back to Kingston. Over. Staying on board. Sailing back to Kingston. Need anything? Over. We need nothing. Over. My respects to Mrs Osborne. If there's a problem, call Mac Allister. See you in Kingston. Cheerio, Jacques. Over. See you in Kingston. So long. Over. Up on the deck. To wave goodbye. What can we do? Do as we were told. And afterwards? We'll see. You... find... idea... boat... go... OK? The first thing to do is throw your boxes overboard. You... understand, Captain? How much must be unloaded? I'd first need to know how much cargo you have. 600 rifles, 12 mortars and cartridges. I'm not asking for an inventory. How much does the cargo weigh? - About 7 tons. - What about the keel? Do you know how deep it is in the sand? - No, no. - I'll have to go and see. Have you got a mask? Me... dive... to see. - Something wrong? - No, nothing. You've been with Morrison long? 6 months... But I've known him for 5 years. You don't like it when he drinks, do you? What about you? How far is the nearest land? 100 nautical miles. Maybe a little less. 150 kms. Could we get there with the raft? With petrol, water and good weather, it might be done. Why? You want to leave us? It would be better than staying here. I don't think you'll make it. You're wasting your time. Morrison has always been straight with me. You think I'm totally drunk. You're not altogether wrong. Even with what I managed to throw overboard I had to drink quite a lot. And I don't like rum. Morrison is a barrel! It took three hours before he collapsed. I've played the fool all night to no avail. And why did you act this way? To try and steal the raft. What did I risk anyway? I wouldn't have died... What did Ruiz do all the time? Everything failed because of him. I didn't manage to see if he was asleep or not. I'd almost reached the raft, but he heard me, so I started to sing, I said I was going to the yacht club to see if the bar was still open. That's when he brought me here. You were thinking of leaving in the raft with Hendrix? No, with you. - With me? - Yes. - Why? - Why not? But... who's that Hendrix? My first husband. - Long time ago? - 8 years ago. He was in medical school. A very bright student. All the women liked him. And so did I. We were getting along nicely. But he was feeling impatient about his career. He wanted to earn money in other ways. He made fantastic plans. I was wrong about him. He was a mythomaniac. I left him. Later, it went from bad to worse. He was arrested for making false prescriptions and selling drugs. It wasn't easy for him to get himself out of that affair. - If I had managed to get on the raft, could we... - No. It doesn't matter. We'll go back on the boat. On the boat? It's the time of high tides. We only need 12 inches more water. - Yes, but we'll have to take the boat back. - Yeah... Tomorrow, when Morrison is on the island. Hendrix... is he reliable? No... I hope he'll make it, but you can't rely on him. You must tell him nothing. Ruiz is the problem... I don't want you to worry... but we'll only try something when we feel sure about it. They won't give us a second chance. Get out of the way. Let me do it. Don't drink, if you can't take your liquor. From now on, you'll stay in the cabin. - In the mood for some more rum? - No, water. Want some? Stay on deck. Hugo! Shoot! What are you waiting for? - Come on, shoot! - Give me a rope! - The raft! It's going away! - Get it! Get down! Take it. - Is it bad? - I don't think so. - Get the first-aid kit! - Where? First cabin port side. - Port? - On the left. It's the fourth rib. It's broken. The bullet went right through. You're lucky. We need something to make him sleep. Sedatives? There are some. - Are we going to make it? - We'll try. - I won't be much help. - Doesn't matter. She'll help me. - He's changed weapons! - Can he get to us? No, not here. The boat has a double hull. The bullets shouldn't get through it. Why is he shooting? He can't even see us. - To prevent us from going on deck. - Can't we shoot him? With this? - What about the rifles? - There's no ammunition left on board. So there's nothing we can do... On the contrary, we can do many things. First we'll jettison and then set anchor. But we must protect ourselves. - What do I do? - Remove all the mattresses from the bunks and pile them up here. And find the underwater mask. Yes... the mattresses... and the mask... You can go now. Bend down. - Where are you going to put it? - Behind. As far as possible. Remember when we arrived I showed you a fairway at least 10 feet deep? If we can pull the boat up to there, we'll be all right. But I need to take the anchor, set it down ten yards beyond the fairway and then pull on it. You understand? Yes. But how will you get it there? I'll go on foot. No, I mean it. Not really the usual way to do it but the only one left to us. That's why I need the mask. What about Morrison? You'll have to go up and breathe... I'll be far from him. And I'll try to breathe quickly. What is he doing? A while ago he was moving. Now I can't see him. I hope the engine has not been hit. What now? Now we wait until high tide. Not until ten at night. Rae! It's just what I needed. At least now we know he's on the island. We're lucky the mortars are still here. There's a leak somewhere. Petrol. One of the tanks is leaking. So we can't use the engine any more... No. A spark and we'll blow away. And now we can't move the boat... We can raise it with the anchor. And afterwards we'll use the sails. But don't smoke and don't put the lights on. It might be dangerous. Even after I'm finished. For a few more hours. - That smell's horrible! - Don't stay here. I'd rather you went on deck to keep watch. I need to catch my breath. It moved! I'm sure of it. The tide will be at its peak in half an hour. I'm going to try it. So? We've made it? We'll actually manage to go away? I think so, yes. You'll excuse me for thinking of myself, but where do you intend to go? I can't imagine landing in Kingston. We could leave you in... Panama. - Panama? - We could have the boat repaired there. Panama... I think I know someone in Panama. A very important guy. Don't come down! Keep an eye on the anchor. It'll be time soon!
