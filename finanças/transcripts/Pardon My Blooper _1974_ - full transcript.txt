And the weather man down at the battery here in New York says that the forecast for today is clear. Clear up to my ass. Ankles. - [Narrator] No documentary of the history of broadcasting would be complete without radio's most classic blooper. - [Man] October 1938. (dramatic music) While America slumbered in a period of calm after World War One, a war to end all wars, in Europe, Adolf Hitler's unholy alliance was making plans for the conquest of the free world, which he hoped to crush under the heels of his new form of tyranny. Nazism. In America, October 30, 1938. It was Halloween night. Millions of American families were safe in their homes, enjoying the entertainment of their favorite radio programs, in an era of peace. In New York City, a group of professional actors in the Mercury Theater, under the direction of Orson Welles, were about to present the famous H.G. Wells story, War of the Worlds. A radio program that would startle most of the nation. And which turned out to be a blooper nightmare for the broadcast industry.

In the role of Dr. Pearson, scientist. - [Welles] Of the creatures in the rocket cylinder at Grover's Mill, I can give you no authoritative information either to their nature, their origin, or their purposes here on Earth. Want of a better term, I shall refer to the mysterious weapon as a heat ray. - [Man] Thank you, Professor Pearson. Ladies and gentleman, I have a grave announcement to make. Incredible as it may seem, both the observations of science and the evidence of our eyes, lead to the inescapable assumption that those strange beings who landed in the Jersey farmlands tonight, are the vanguard of an invading army from the planet Mars. (upbeat music) - [Welles] This is Orson Welles, lady and gentleman. Out of character to assure you that the War of the Worlds has no further significance than it's a holiday offering it was intended to be. The Mercury Theater's own radio version of dressing up in a sheet and jumping out of a bush and saying boo. You will be relieved, I hope, to learn that we didn't mean it. So goodbye everybody and remember please, for the next day or so, the terrible lesson you learned tonight. That grinning, glowing, globular invader of your living room is an inhabitant of the pumpkin patch. And if your doorbell rings and nobody's there, that was no Martian. It's Halloween.
