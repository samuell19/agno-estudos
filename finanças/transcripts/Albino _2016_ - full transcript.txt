Excuse me. Can you bring the Pipe wrench? Sure. Thank you. It should be Okay now. Thank you very much. Daddy, it's fixed. How much is it? Excuse me, how much is it? Wait a second... Mr. Kitazato! You should have called me later. Shit. How much is the payment today? It's 7500 Yen. Wait a sec, I will bring the receipt. Wait a sec. Sorry... Thank you very much. ALBINO It was a weird house. The shutter was closed and it seemed like no one is living inside. Agree. It was spooky. There are houses like that. What is that? That girl gave me. What is inside? I guess it's a candy. Let me see. It is a candy. Can I have some? Please. Yes, it sure is a candy. Good. Lucky me. Do you think you can bring her home? Yes, I'm sure. You say that all the time. No I don't. - Are you really interested in them? - I'm only interested in their looking. Mrs. YASHIMA. Sorry I wasn't listening. I think woman's body is the most important. You know the flexibility and the elasticity but he says personality matters the most. I don't know. Boss says physical chemistry between the couple is the most important. Emotion comes later. But I think emotion comes first. Above all, we are animals. If our body fits, everything should be okay. That is why you are not taken serious by the hostesses. I should spend more time... What do you think Mrs. YASHIMA? Sorry, I don't care. I'll go arrange the PVC. Okay. Hi. Mrs. YASHIMA? Yes. Did you finish Mr. Tanaka's house? I need a bit more time. Fine. Can you go to Mr. Endo's house after that? Oh, the house we went 3 days ago? Yes. It was stuck again. Did I mistake? I'm not sure. Can you just check out? Okay. I'll go after this. Thanks. By the way... Something is wrong. Is it? I told you not to flush tissue papers. I know. The same thing happened to the bathroom. What? Bathroom. I'll take a look. Can I take a look? Sure... Are you Okay? Didn't we fix this house recently? Maybe because it's an old house. Mrs. YASHIMA, weren't you in charge? Yes. How was it? I'll go again. It might be my bad. Okay. Thank utero. Boss, I can sue you for sexual harassment. What about your school? I don't go so much. Then, why do you always wear school uniforms. It's like fashion... I see. Why do you always give me this? Is it some kind of a lucky charm? Yes. You will be addicted to it. I might already be. That is my scheme. I'm frustrated. You should tell me before you come. If you are away, I can just leave. I have nothing to do. The last train already left. No problem. I came on a bicycle. Seriously? Yeah, It's just 12 miles away and I'd rather buy a beer instead of riding a train. I'm glad to see your face. Do you know how much I worry about you? Thank you... Aren't you hungry? Oh, I forgot. You should eat something on the way home. I guess so. Sorry. Okay, I will go. Take care. Thanks, I'll come around to see you. Sorry... Bye. You were early. Please come in. Dad is still inside... Is it Okay? He is about to leave. Excuse me. Sorry every time. She is the one to blame but you know she is quite dumb and... Excuse me. I don't think you should hit your daughter. See you later. Do you want to go on a drive? Don't you have to go back? It's okay... It should be. I'm ashamed of what you saw. I feel strange recently. I never felt like this... I'm really confused. Me too. I always felt... my inside and outside isn't fitting... So. I didn't want to be intimate with people. I don't think you can understand. That doesn't matter. My period started yesterday. Was it late? Yes. How late? I even forgot about it. I see. Maybe I lost my inner balance or, it recovered. Oh yeah? Do you hate being a woman? Sometimes. I hate being a woman. Oh, you were here... Oh, god. I didn't expect you. This is for you. Thank you. Did you come by car? Yes. Do you want some? Thank you. Are you doing Okay recently? Why? Nothing... Oh, I found it. I always keep your photo with me. Do you remember that boy when you were young? Can I go upstairs? Sure... Maybe something is wrong with me. Maybe not. But I feel secure here. I've been... agonizing... I gotta run. I have to go. Hi... Again? Is it our fault? That's too much. Should I go? They only want women to work. Mrs. YASHIMA.ã€€-Yes. How old is that girl, calling every time. I think she is 17 or 18. If she is older than 18, please introduce her to me. See you. I'm uptight. Me too. I don't like this. Sorry... Can't you get away from him? He will find me easily... I can't stand this... I can't stand you living with him. I don't know what to do... This never happened to me and I don't know how to stop, what to do... I don't know either. My step father is coming back. Can I stay here? You will be uncomfortable. I don't care... The tools are wet. Please take care of it before it gets rusty. Okay. Um... What? Did you get a boy friend? No way. I heard. "When you are having a good sex life, the shape of your nose change." Sorry, that was a lie. Who is it? I don't have any one. I won't tell the boss. I don't... Please. I don't have interest. In men? Seriously? Haven't you dated someone? Yes, before. And how was it? It didn't work. Why? It's a hassle. What is? Getting tied down or sex? That is one reason but everything didn't fit. You had a bad boy friend. Are you finished? I don't feel good today so I will come early tomorrow and finish the rest. I see. Bye. Hey... Yes. Um... I'll go. Aren't you ole enough? I refuse. Just give me a head... Are you dumb? I can't even understand what you are saying. You are mean. Good bye. Ouch! You tried to hurt me. Shut up! Stop! Please! What? Please stop. Shut the fuck up! No! Please! I really can't... It's your fault. Fuck... Fuck... Sorry... This will be the last time... Thank you. You are so sweet since you were a child. Hey, What? ... Nothing. What!? Nothing. See you then. He is here. Let's go somewhere. Why not? Hey! He wants to take a bath so you have to fix it now. Let's go. Please come in. I have to go. No. Let's go... Come on... Sorry... What should I say... Why didn't you stop me? You are unfair. Hey! Hey! Hey!
