Look at me, Mrs. Leaf, You're wearing this dress right away because it's a mother's gift. You're coming down right now, got it? [angry scream] Look at me, I'm not eating these crazy things, my dear. Come quickly, before your pancake gets cold. [angry scream] You want to see a princess, queen mother? To heal presses.

Happy birthday Leaf! [nidalar] -What's this? -[cheer] Leaf president, hey! Son, are you going to turn me from crying into a potato? Leaf president! # There are unfulfilled and unfinished business # # from our laziness # This place has been around since Ali's family moved to England... ... our second home where we gather at every opportunity. These are just as out-of-tune as I grew up with... ... my friends, my brothers, my everything. my rainbow... he is the opposite, he is jealous, he is abusive but he has the biggest heart in the world. My flirtatious Sinan bird, whose existence is a gift to the woman's existence. She always manages to make me feel special. And my Oghuz bird. Oğuz, who is from the three Ps, namely pizza, pajamas and filth likes to look at life through Kate Upton's fork. -Look at what the man gave as a gift. -Don't say that, Ali bird. The man gave his holy gift. It's my turn, close your eyes. This is my gift to you. -Shall I open? -Hungry. But this is very... That's a lot of grandma work. But the most beautiful necklace in the world. I will not take it off my neck for the rest of my life. I promise you. That's how they get a man's dimple out. Ali bird has been my dimpled hero since childhood. And the flavors are gone. Cut off Merve's tweet. "I fell in love with an ox." If they draw an ox as a sketch, you will be arrested. Get over my sister Merve. You have that new girl, her friends are legendary. It was "Aş Merve". What about your coma when you see Ece? Really huh. Psst. What are you giggling about? Now it snowed on my birthday. And I found myself a new wish. my new wish that those four donkeys never leave my life again. You knew this. Then... All our daughters, daughters for all of us. I thought that's all my birthday surprises that day. Until the next day. Good morning and good week, dear students of our high school. Opportunities provided by your parents Another weekend you squandered is over. Your families can tolerate your disregard. But as you know, I never do. -The manager still can't taste it. -It's the usual way. The physicist was going to explain the notes. Let's see if he gave messages to Gökhan again. Gokhan, thirty-three. Hmmm. I'm blonde. Ferrous. Damage to school property? Do you know what animal you remind me of? Possum. These animals are in danger they pretend to be dead so realistically... ... they even exaggerate and smell corpses. Possum. [horror movie sound effects] Yes, it's about listening to the lecture in general And I know you have problems with retention. So let's go over one. Already this glass dome, metal rod, etc. I know you won't remember. But please note that Look at the halo. There should be an age limit to open an account on social media. You're right, it's full of children. Opposites attract each other. Please at least keep that in mind. Last... ... I'll be a slave for forty years if you give me a pair of breasts, okay? Look, my mother wrote something directly under it... "What a loyal and beautiful son I have raised. May all my milk be halal to you, my dear." He wrote it, and his mention has come to an end. Tireless. What happened, did you have so much fun? Explain a little. It's possible. Now, my teacher, our Oguz tweeted that the last thing... [door knocks] I'm sorry, sir. The manager is also calling Yaprak Ayvaz. [thriller music] Or Ms. Leaf. This is what would happen if you descended into the well with Oguz's rope. Why are you distracting her while a mouse is in her closet? The manager is waiting for you inside. Well, that's not the principal's brain room. "You think high heels aren't for you" But when I bring out the princess in you... ... I want you to come to me with these... ... so that I can look right into your loving eyes." So you're saying there was this box in the middle of the empty classroom and this note on it. I searched everywhere for the girl who called me but There is no such student on duty today. What do you think? I found the first I don't know where to put the second one in that sender. Oguz, look at me, this isn't one of your scumbags, is it? I have no business with my hands, feet or shoes. I'm an MS man. My case is different. This guy could be a serious pervert now that he knows your size down to your feet. Leaf, you don't go out alone from now on. But a name comes to mind. [thriller music] Tuna. -Tuna? -Tuna? Tuna Karaman, who enrolled in the school in the middle of the semester It brought many mysteries with it. For Tuna's record, Tuna's father, a well-known criminal lawyer, It is a well-known fact that he donated a large amount. Her mother, a prominent fashion editor it also explained quite well his mastery of choosing shoes. Again, by a twist of fate, Danube lives with her grandmother on the upper floor. Right guess. Shoe size. However, there was one small detail that showed that he wasn't the person we were looking for. Guys, Tuna thing. -What? -Thing. -I think you were going to say something to tuna. -Is that tuna? Do people's orientations make you laugh that much? [clears throat] -Tuna, I'm... -Well. I hope you can tell today. Or will we wait for you to climb the evolutionary ladder? I guessed so too. From what I understand from your primitive conversation... ...you're wondering if I sent you these cheap pleasure shoes. No, I didn't send it. If not Tuna, who was this pervert? Oguz, cut the middle. Oguz, throw the ball. Lan Oguz, don't linger, throw the ball. -Oguz, lick this foot of yours... -The manager is here. I guess today is my acceptance day. Born? "Why am I even excited to see you playing football?" Doesn't this look like the note in the box? damn pole! You need to be more specific bro. These are all sticky. I think you are looking for me. I am Peace. It was hot this time, lanky boy. You will eat a pair of high heels for the main course. -Is there a problem, captain? -There is. Tell your captain to open the back door, there is a ride. I'm glad my gift has arrived. -So you admit your guilt, well done. No. If there is a culprit... ...that's my heart. I'll rip your heart out! This cynical wit Look, look, this is self-confidence. This head... What the fuck is this?! By the way, I get a very nasty head bite. Animals are truly fascinating creatures. Species are programmed to learn, children. They do not learn from their mistakes and do not make the same mistake again. Except for one. Bal porsuğu. After the honey badger was bitten by the snake he was fighting... "I'll save you if you promise to meet me in the backyard." ... do you know what the first thing he does when he wakes up? It hits another snake. You are a honey badger, Demirli. But this time you got the wrong snake. Let's see what your parents will say about this situation. The queen mother will apprentice me to industry this time for sure. It's all my fault, teacher. I provoked friends and started the fight. Get out. Except you. Exit! Oğuz, we have defrosted the pizza. Janitor Kamil solved it. -Give me a slice. -Of course. -Get. -Don't get dirty for two minutes, son. We are eating here. Meanwhile, young people... Isn't that your manager's tool? Where did you solve it son? Let me bury that pizza, straight from here to the toilet. Then let the cacophony show begin. Ali bird, where? Thanks to Oğuz, I was full. I'm taking a nap to class. Don't get up before you finish your meal. I'm going to something, I'm going to do something. I'm not coming or I don't know. Give it to your brother Gökhan. Mary is in the canteen. Are you looking? No. You will look. Watch. [moving music] [sword voice] If you're the type that girls approve of, you're looked after. Do you see these ladies? Gently touch their hands in turn, first with the outside of your hand. Girls will be curious about the person touching you and look at you. Of course, the main girl too. Now it's all up to a sincere call. Naber? [sword voice] Understood. [sword voice] [sword voice] Sorry guys. -What's up, Merve, the president. -What are you doing? You humiliate me in front of my friends. Do you have these friends of yours? Do you hear what comes out of your mouth? She hears, Merve, she hears. But let the whole school hear that? Sound, test, one, two. Merve, if you have a new boyfriend, I'm... [# Figaro opera #] [laugh] Wow, you're a man of your word, Amazon girl. Cut short pole. He will say, then to his married house, to his peasant village. We're finally alone. Let me enjoy. You are so beautiful that one can sing songs. Look at me, you're curling so beautifully too people come to you to dress in a skirt. You would love this, wouldn't you? Ok. Here is your opportunity. Some kind of claim. One on one basketball game. The winner wears the skirt. Look at me I don't know how I look from there but I'm still not crazy enough to go to a basketball game with the captain of the basketball team. Your two counts against my ten count. [dubstep music] You say. Agreed. Out on the field. But if our people hear it, I won't get involved. Shhh. What are you doing here son? I haven't done anything. What are you doing? What should I do, I was with the principal. This time he compared me to a brainless sea cucumber clinging to the hand of the person holding it. Thanks. Ya... I'm not feeling well today. You have something since morning. What are you looking at and going crazy, my son is there. No problem bro. I'm going home, you can tell our kids. Demek Bade he? I know people like you well. You think you are something. You enter the life of anyone you wish by waving your hand, you deserve this too. Those are expensive words, Amazon girl. Let's see if your wrist is as strong as your chin. One left. I hope you in your skirt aren't as bad as your basketball. Of! Sırık! [game end bell] No congratulations? Come slow lord of the poles. Did your head, which was entrusted to you because you beat the girl until tomorrow, reached the sky? Did you think I wouldn't beat you just because you're the girl I fell in love with? Besides, I couldn't miss seeing you in a skirt. Tomorrow is the first day of your princess. Now you are burned, Yaprak Ayvaz. [sighs] So the whole school wears it. How bad could it be? There was really no way I could wear those two spans. Let's see what will come out of it? Yuh, what is this? Anne! You won't feel anything, my beautiful girl, trust me. Deep breath. So that's the wax that girls get so much trouble with on the toilet. This much. Yes, what did we say? Atomic physics, which studies the structure and properties of the atom at the same time, in the structure of substances formed by molecules... [knock on door] -Come. Sir, can I come in? Ayvaz, go ahead, my daughter. [students shouts of surprise] Don't look. Don't look! Get back, you beast. Sorry ma'am, what did you do to Yaprak? I'm gonna have to update my whole point system because of you dude. Don't keep embarrassing the girl. We made a bet with that pole. One on one basketball game or something. You with the captain of the basketball team... I lost. Merve is over, you started. Put on those pants because you're going to murder the man. Karademir no? Are you going to show us the size of an average atom? [laughter] This guy won't be able to get rid of me this time. Uh. No fight. We will shoot him with his own gun. What is in your mind? If they're basketball players... Don't make the man sick Oguz, focus on the game. Ali bird, the power of those basketball babies is not enough for us. Calm down a bit. We will beat them in such a way that they will sue us for sexual abuse. Youth. Who are these types? The bastard brought the school football team. Weren't they regional champions? I don't play against them. Look, Real Madrid vs. Yenimahalle coffee team. There is Gökhan Karademir, there is no panic. Gather. Here's the tactic. Everyone will win this match, even at the cost of their own life. Exactly. Come on! [moving music] [moving music] Are you ready for your punishment and my reward, Amazon girl? I'm waiting for a kiss from you right here. The pole really deserved a kiss this time. But not from me. Come on, Amazon girl, how long are you going to wait? It'll be worth the wait. Let's get you some chocolate milk. These cattle even found the stash in the crisper and blew it up. Dude says let's be more human. Counting our bites? We were not going to eat it without defrosting those winter coats. Right now, I have stalactites in my sensitive parts. Anyway, gentlemen, let's not be unresponsive to the list. Now we have frozen pizza and stuff like that. You also have human foods such as vegetables and fruits. Chips are also in Gökhan. Where is Gokhan? Merve, I have only one request from you. That hairy arm in the photo you shared Say it belongs to the mutated Kübra. Ok. Hi. I'm bad. I am Gökhan's friend. -Where is he? -I wonder where? -I'm Sinan. -You are Ali, right? Party? No, it's our usual shopping. How would you like me to join you tonight? I do not think so. See you later. It is not said in a fight. I don't understand, but Gökhan told me... Merve, I'm so sorry, I love you so much. There was probably a misunderstanding. Sorry. Now I understand why they called you the ice prince at school. It may be so for them, but... ... in my world ... ...there is no ice that will not melt at a hot enough temperature. [tearing music] Have fun for now. Ice prince. Legendary man. In honor of. What the hell is that? The girl officially brewed cold tea on her chin. Dude, you rejected a perfect nine. I think you should crash right now. Don't take it too long so I won't hit you now. Find Gökhan as soon as possible and bring him home. Take that butter from my hand so that it doesn't melt from my fire, Ali ice. Don't be silly, pass the eggs. Do you see? Involuntarily, they were boiled in my hand, Ali ice. I forbid the word ice in this house until further notice. But Ali is ice. Or I'll wring your little hands holding those eggs. I lost my mind that I would never see that dimple again. White man down. White man down. So you from me... Bad. Wow. May Mecnun Gökhan not reunite with his Merve. But Ali, the captain can get his wish. Love has won again. Ne Bade'si lan? It's a leaf. We are originally Georgian immigrants. Guys, give a hand and let's get this in a shower. I run away. My mother mentioned it, my grandmother came. -Did Nunu come? Say hi a lot. -I won't tell in life. -I'll come with you. -Gentlemen, shower? Brother, where are you going? Are you angry? Are you kidding me? I'm foaming. The man threw up on me. After that, he comes home like this and finds himself in the garbage in the morning. So you're not angry that I made fun of Bade. -What does that have to do with anything? -You look great with Bade. -That's okay. -How much is a flute, son? Leaf, you should just come out. -What are you trying to imply to me? -Okay, calm down, Ali bird. You may have fallen in love with Bade, but I... ... I expected you to be honest with me. Are you talking about honesty? It was as if I was the one who hid the fact that I met and argued with that boy. Okay, you want honesty? Then answer me honestly. Are you interested in Barış? To the pole? Let asteroid rain fall in your mouth. Thanks. I'm not in love with Bade either. Now extend your hand. Used, used. From now on the heart of either of us if it crashes for someone else, the other one will know first. Deal? I hope I get along well with your future girlfriend. Because you are too good a friend to be lost. Oh, your heart is beating so fast. I got a little tired while carrying Gökhan. Crack crack crack! Fondip! Okay, okay, my queen, I heard. Come on, drive carefully, okay. My parents are on their way. They'll be back tomorrow night. Ali said to my son that I also left wraps in the closet, so that he can eat something in his stomach. -Oh, my aunt, dear. -Hey can. Any news from Gökkuş? Stomach-washed beef. But don't worry about the situation. Don't get lost anywhere. Crying girls were Ali's weakness. Whenever he helps a sad girl He felt closer to his lost sister. This is exactly what's happening right now. I guess. Can I sit? Our pole room is upstairs. Peace. Peace. What an honor to hear my name from your mouth, Amazon girl. Don't slow down now. I felt a little bad. Is it for me or... Are you aware? I can't even talk to you when Ali can be with whoever he wants. And what are you talking about, lord of the poles? I say selfishly Amazon girl, selfishly. -What are you doing here? -Did you understand? Look, let's agree on one thing. If I'm staying calm, it's because Leaf loves you. But don't take your chances at every opportunity. -It won't be good for you. -What happens if I try? Ali stop, calm down. I let it sit. It confused you, didn't it? OK, fine. You like pretensions, don't you? Let's figure it out, then. -Make a bet with me too. -Not necessary. It's between us. You choose the claim and the reward. Thanks. Ok. Then if Leaf doesn't get ninety on his next physics exam Get the hell out of this girl's life. Alright. But if I win, I want an apology from you. apology? I didn't know I hurt you so much. Just a minute. Did you just make a bet on me? While I'm here, without asking me. Leaf. I thought, good idea. And I will understand what it means to whom. Wherever you're making your bet. We're gonna get you a real girl today, okay? I ate his wife and daughter. It's been two hours since I ordered pizza. Forget the pizza now. You can't spend your life waiting for Kate Upton to pose. Watch. [sword voice] Sir? Do we know each other? I'm sure you said my name. Your voice was in my head. Am I reading your thoughts? That's incredible. Please let me try something. Say and tell him to keep a number from 1 to 10. Seven. The trick is, when you say 1 to 10... ... at the point where you snap your finger. Subconscious. What's up, Sinan? Ece? I see that you have also met Yasemin. Yasemin is my brother. It's good to see you move on with your life. But I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't choose your prey from my girlfriends. Well, you Ece, do you miss us? You know the answer to that, Sinan. I'm better, if that's the problem. -Sinan. -What? -You're strangling my friend. -What? There couldn't have been a better timing. [beep, alarm sound] [ring tone] Exactly. The winner of the day was Oğuz. Sit on the board or. Take it easy. Neuron wars. [phone ring] Leave that phone open. I lied to you. We didn't break up with Ece because she moved. When her father cheats on her mother... ...Ece was destroyed. Without me... ... she hates men... ...and he said I should go on without him. I also found a solution myself. And I decided to hang out with the girls for the day. I ate good shit. If I don't fall in love with anyone... ...When Ece gets over all this... ... I thought we'd start where we left off. How pathetic, right? But if he were here right now... ... I'm so ready to give up everything. Ece? OK, I'll be right back. See what you have. [spitting, gagging sounds] [moving music] Leaf. Leaf. [sniffs] Chocolate with liqueur. It was like this when I got home. But. Pray for the spare keys at my grandmother's. Next time there's this much noise You can be sure that I will inform the police. How are you? Can you walk to the room? A minute. I can handle my own business. All right, Ali Efendi? [vomiting sound] Tuna... Bedtime, little cheetah. Come on. I do not understand. How do you bet with that pole even if it means losing me? Because of that girl called Bade? Not a lost girl or a cocky guy. No one has the power to tear me away from you. But Bade is a very beautiful girl. Ali bird, do you think I'm beautiful? Five-year-old girl crying because she can't get a game in that gazebo it was very beautiful. I took it on my back because one foot was in a cast in middle school... ... and then the girl I dropped and broke her other leg. Today, the same girl is still very beautiful as she slowly slips out of my hands. Please don't change for anyone in the name of love. Is it possible? Leaf? I love you. [music] [joyful music] [laughs] Look son, I swear I'm going to dive into one now. Why are they laughing, son? Is my zipper open or something? You're so beautiful, dude, they're laughing at her. My dear Gökhan, I see that the interior and exterior washing has worked. Performance is top again. I'm going to ask you something bro. While washing the stomach, that hose Do they insert it from the top or... I don't know, Oğuz. If you want, let me consult a midwife working in the health sector, huh? The miracle of modern medicine. They took the dirt from his mouth along with the man's stomach, brother. That's it after that. To Merve, she will be your aunt again, I made some promises. I don't have such jealousy and abusiveness, brother. By the way, where is Leaf? The word good man could only sound so ugly. What happened to this? He turned into a fly that was sprayed with medicine. [Mary, breath] -Oho. -Good morning. -Good morning. Do I look so bad? No, no, honey, you look great. The only thing missing is... It's done now. I'll say something, dude, you wouldn't do such things. Well, the last time I ate chocolate, I don't remember what happened next. Dude, think about it this way, at least you're not drinking shampoo. Exactly. Ya da kankanla öpüşmüyorsun. Who did you kiss? Ali... you said? What happened? Are you angry? Do you know what to do? Let's kiss and make up. You love. Let's kiss and make up. Oooo. The double doves were also here. Actually, you're more than a dove... ...you look like gilded bamboo monkeys. Do you know the gilded bamboo monkeys? -Slow! -Excuse me, sir. I was trying to catch up. Here is another confused person who thinks he came to the shopping mall for school. Forgive my curiosity, young lady. How much shorter can a skirt get? If you're done with these fake fashion comments, would you let me? -I don't understand, lad. -I say, By detaining people right now, you are publicly hindering their teaching. As an educator, I hope you realize that this is unethical. Do you realize you're talking to a manager? Take back your words and apologize to me immediately. Of course, you likewise humiliate If you apologize to all these students, why not? That's enough! I'm going to call your parent today and get you suspended from school. I wouldn't recommend doing this. Because when my father heard about this outdated mobbing you did to your students, He can't wait to make a whopping lawsuit against you. [applause] These macaque flocks won't stay here! It won't stay here! Son, why are these laughing at me? -Yes, ladies and gentlemen, good morning. -Good morning teacher. Let's take our seats, clear the desks. Give your exam papers from front to back to your friends, please help. Yes, we cleared the desks, we will start when the paperwork is finished. Blow after blow. Ali bird, how will I get ninety? You keep that beautiful head of yours alone. No one has the power to tear me away from you. Yes, if it's over, let's start the paperwork exam. Tell me, Karademir. Teacher, in the garden of our school A Karademir principle is being violated by the eye. Let me go. You will be deemed to have scored zero on the exam. You know right? Sir, on the one hand, science, on the other hand, a lover dressed in tights and suspenders. Karademir is lost. [teacher clears throat] Here you go, master. Yes, the second blank paper of the exam came from Sinan Yorulmaz, right? What happened? Are you going to freshen up your makeup? are you in a hurry? [laughs] How so, sir, I do not understand? I hope you are not taken, I saw the photo you shared with the school group. No, I was not taken, I do not remember that I took a photo or something. -Shall I see? -Is that so? Ulan Oguz. - Shall I go out, sir? -Come on. I'll go out. [moving music] Leaf Ayvaz. Ninety-three. Yeah this nameless slobbering blank paper? Tekelioglu. -I couldn't sleep last night, sir. -I hope it was worth it. It was the best night of my life. Look at me, Tekelioglu. From now on it'll take me away from that dimple if you make any bets I do it so bad. [footsteps] Leaf, you were right what you said yesterday. I shouldn't have bet on losing you. So I made a big mistake. Al, al sana iddia. Get a loan! Ninety-three. Congratulations. In this case, you won the bet. -I'm sorry. - His apology is not from me... ... you will beg from Yaprak. I do not understand. You keep saying there is a princess in Yaprak... ... that's what you and people like you don't understand. Does she have to wear heels to be a princess? Isn't he worthy of anyone when he wears cloth shoes and swears? I don't care about your love. But what you did It does nothing but reduce Leaf's self-respect. That's why it's not my apology... ... you will beg from Yaprak. Leaf, Look, if my manners are hurting your self-confidence... ...I'm sorry. [moving music] Hoop, boom! Ali bird, hey! Ali bird oh my! Ali bird, hey! I think that cover sound was heard from the whole school. It echoed outside, that's all. Ali, next time you need to write my name on the exam paper. However, I forgive you. Or it adorns you too, I hand it over to Gökhan, who was imprisoned because of Merve. Gokkus, what happened? Mary left me. Come on. I was suffocating him with my envy. Let's go home, you can relax a bit. Dude, I think we should go too. I'm so stuck I swear I'm going to piss my bottom right now. All right. -Don't keep pulling. -Isn't he Bade? All right, come on girl, don't be hard on me. Hee Bade. If you come one. Is there any problem? No bro, as you can see we are talking to our girlfriend. Isn't it, darling? What lover? We are no longer lovers. What are you pushing? Look bro, obviously the girl doesn't have a heart. Don't stop doing artistic because there is a girl with you, don't be itchy. Go away! You walk too! -Are you okay? -I am good. We can take you home, do you want it? No, I'll go myself. Dude, I guess I can't hold it any longer, I'm going to pee. -Let's go home too. -Lets go. -Sevim sister, respect. -Mehmet brother. Ya Ali, is it still not cooked? We're hungry here. I don't understand how heavy this is. I don't speak up because my son is depressed. If I get there, I'll sweep you under the rug. Just kidding, this really tied him to the housewife. You're not human when you're hungry, bro. Dude, if you're too hungry, you can suck my toe from the front. That's it! There are no crossovers, you will watch the replay. I am coming. What are you feeding us today, Ali bird? I answer. With love and vitamins. Hmm. I adore vitamins. -Did you call Bade? -I don't have a number. It looked like he was going to get over it anyway. [painful cry] -What happened? -My eye. Leaf, are you okay, what happened? -Lemon, lemon. -Come on, let me see. -Open your eyes. -Stop, stop, it's burning. -Can you open your eyes, I'll see. -On fire! OK, open your eyes. Ooo. We are waiting for dinner inside, you... ... still lame. It's bad weather, I'll collect the laundry. No, the weather is fine. Let it be. I'll still collect. So... Of course I have to wash them first, right? He who took it lived. Leaf, bassana wedding. Our backs don't come down either. Joke and joke. The man has love. Is everyone miserable Sinan? He has. Then be like you Should we cry because "Merve left me"? There is room. -I gotta go. -Merve. Because my parents are on the way. If I'm not home when they come now big malfunction occurs. I'm going. # This girl loves me # # This girl kills me # # This girl makes me dream beautiful # I know, that kissing thing... ... yes, it was an accident, even Oguz and Sinan kissed... But while we laughed at them, we strangely chose to avoid each other. # This girl smiles when she sees me # # This girl # We hosted Tuna and her grandmother, whose houses were sprayed, for one night. The strange boy is that Tuna. Do not be afraid of anyone, but be afraid of an insect. And Peace. I never saw him again after his lost bet. Was I being too harsh on him? [cries of pain] The queen mother is in danger. Enough mother queen! Gone boy. It's warm, honey, it's cold. How was it? Is the skewer down a bit, let me see? Okay, it's down. He has proven once again how obtuse he is by coming here. Don't give me that "why did I give birth" look, queen mother. What is this rod doing here? How many times will I tell you my baby, my little Yaprak? We met at the market, I have bags in my hand. “Let me carry your bags, auntie,” he said. Move, baby, I said. Meanwhile, my neck was stiff. Ayy, how cute, how cute. Let me help my father throw the pole's body into the sea, and it's over. We are even. My dear, don't look at this crazy girl, your uncle Taner wouldn't do such things. Uncle Taner doesn't do such things. We already live in the Scandinavian country. Mistress, madam, your log is Manisa. My father's Amasya... ... I did not understand what the comfort of this is. Get out of there! I am a born and bred Izmirian. Anyways. Come on, my dear, you guys have a little chat, it's nice, let's see. I've thought a lot since the last time we met, Leaf. And I realized that I didn't give you the opportunity to get to know me. So I got stuck on this one, I'm sorry. Behind... ... let's start from scratch. No such mysterious gifts, games, claims. As Barış, I would like to invite you to the party tonight. Today we will gather at Ali's with the children. So have fun. Mom! You can go out, I'm going. To where? See you later. Or encountering the female of an MS life. Is this your joy? The female of your life? The teen whose love life is confined to the Kate Upton poster in her room says that? Even thinking about the details of that relationship makes my stomach turn up, bro. Gentlemen, am I sensing jealousy? Do not shake these, Oguz bird. I am already ready to be sister-in-law full of intrigues. That's it. My homie. Thank you. This was expected of you. -What do you mean I see? -Oh. The fun has begun. -Wow Wow wow. -Ali? -What's up? -Ece. -Gokhan? -It's the same brother, it's Merve. So Leaf, what are you doing? I'm fine Ali bird. Well, as you know. It's not like I know. We had peace just now. It's stuck with my mom. He was going to invite me to the party tonight. there is no claim anymore, I was going to give him a chance, something like that, that's it. Well, what did you say? I gave you your mouth's share, my dear, it's gone. Enough! We are a few teenage kids. What do you exaggerate so much about? I'm not saying don't exaggerate, exaggerate as a hobby. Take the food, for example. Don't let drinking out of trouble cause you to vomit. You missed the pizza too much... ... exaggerate the laughter. If you have tears in your eyes, let them come from laughter. I'm not exaggerating like Kanye West. Do not offend anyone with your jealousy. Neither the other person nor yourself. Don't be afraid. To make mistakes, to take chances, of sadness, of love, of rejection. We are young now. Aha. The master of my heart is coming. Leaf, be sober now. As soon as the message comes, you collapse on the table. Okey? Welcome. Are you hungry? Are you crazy? I could kill for a pizza right now. What about for four pizzas? Oghuz. Or Oguz. I hate to say this but... ...I think Oguz is right. We should be bursting with happiness, not anger. Exactly bro, maybe it's never too late to change. Pardon. I can't stand this ugliness any longer. -We are running away, the teenager is entrusted to you. -Thanks. I'm going to go make some room for these pizzas now. You wait here too. Gentlemen, the girl has come to a boil. Dirty time. Do not go! Don't go, don't go, don't go! [message notification sound] Leaf. Sometimes... ... to tell someone how you feel... -...you want a chance. -Understood. Ok, I get it, but... ... I don't know how I feel about Barış now. So I guess the only way I can understand that is if I go to that party. -Is that what you're trying to say? -Yeah. Well... I was trying to tell you that too. Good. Well... there are Oguz's. Both are not around. I'm here too. Look, you didn't get a message either. Come on, go get ready. -Come on. -Okay, okay, I'm going. I'm going. It would be better if you don't text the person you're going to mess with next time, my dear Oğuz. By the way... ...thank you very much for the beautiful photos. If you are very curious, you can see it on the school's website. [knife sound effect] # I spent my days watching my heart # # I tend to fall into the trap of the past # # Eliminate the heart # # Find me a new life now # # One or two nice words are enough to deceive # # Find me a new life now # # One or two nice words are enough to deceive # # A new life # # A new life # # Find a new life # # A new life # What are you doing here? -They said there is a party girl, we came. -It's Oguz. -Very nice. -I can't find anything to say. The fork doesn't look dull, does it? What is your score for me, Sinan bird? Perfect, ten of course. Wow, I thought there were no ten points other than Ece. There are now. We met again on the beach. But this time we managed to talk. And he gave me this note. Sinem, Gözde, Melis, Simay... so this list is getting long, what is it? When I said I don't want anyone else but you, he wrote a name on that list. If I give it enough chances... ... one day any of the people on this list... ... he will make me forget him. You see, there is no Ece anymore, baby. That makes you the only owner of ten points until the next lucky girl. I saw the photos on the school's page. I'm sorry that you weren't with Irem. Born? He did me a great disservice. That's why I declared her an MS first lady. So the girl who made me the mess of my life I guess you didn't think I'd miss it. By the way, he wished you a good time tonight. [clears throat] I also bought a gift that I thought would suit your outfit. -Did you buy me a present, my sky bird? -He stole it. Also the bag. -And a women's bag. -He sure stole it. Tamam lan tamam. Actually, I bought it for Merve... Since you bought it for Merve, my smart friend, give it to Merve. I saw him with someone else. Born? Leave one. I used to lead the funeral prayer for both of them there. ... I noticed something in Merve, brother. He was happy. I have never seen him this happy. So this bag is yours. You know, when you say something so lame and put it on your head, you understand? -AA. -I swear heavily, don't do it. Can not hurt you. -Where is Ali? -Phone is unreachable. Are you ready to burn the ground? Come on. Come on, help girl, help. -Thank you for everything, mom. -My dear. Thanks for letting me, dad. I'll be waiting at home by 12 at the latest, Yaprak. Off. TV shows my grandma watched... ... black humor remained next to your exaggerated drama. If you'll excuse me, I'm going upstairs to hang myself. Thank you too, Tuna. You thank the bugs that raided the house. It was the karma of your hospitality. Anyway, let's go now. They give you something like candy, chewing gum, let me say. Such a scumbag comes and talks to you, you say hello, where are you brother Gökhan? Gokhan brother, okay enough, you're offended by her daughter. Have fun, my dear. Guys, I love you all one by one, thank you very much. If you see Ali and reach him, tell him too... But. Will you extend it further? ...or should we turn into mice and the taxi into a pumpkin? You will definitely turn me into a potato from crying. Then... All our daughters, daughters for all of us. See you guys. What a night. What are we doing now? Well, I'll take İrem and pull off my pajamas... ... we will watch the sunrise together. [laughter] Born? What? Is it bad? Bad. You are breathtaking. [music] I love you. If you don't get off now... ... he doesn't look at your grace, I'll kick you out of the car. Come on. little titan... ... if you need it, I'm here for a message. [moving dance music] # Night falls, the sun does not rise on us # # Wake up # # It's not known if it's gone # # But maybe he'll come back if we do a dance # # Safe # # Don't go stay in my arms # # Safe # # Let's have a dance everything is ok # Leaf? Do we know each other? Excuse me, I'm Mert. I know you from our conversations with Barış. I am Barış's best friend. I also own this house and party. I understand you. Let me take you to the sulkiest man of the party. Come on follow me. Is it empty? Wow, I finally managed to get you to wear those heels. If you'll excuse me, I want to be a little proud of myself. If it takes too long, I'll go. You look charming, Amazon girl. This princess stuff is just not for me. My feet are really rotten. Born? As long as I can remember myself, my father has not been around me. He was either working or on a business trip. My mother took care of everything. It is because of him that I am here now. My mother was a true queen. It would surprise me that such a strong woman could be so elegant. Anyways... ... one day when I came home from school, I found a note in the hall. My mom on the note... ...he was saying that he was bored with my father's indifference and left the house. At that moment, I just... ... I was thinking how noble my mother's writing was. -Your mother? -He never came back. I also made a promise to myself. I was going to find my own princess. But unlike my father... ... I would never leave him alone. It saddened me to hear that Barış was a prince under the spell of the queen. Then you appeared before me. You were just like him. You took care of those around you. But you had one little thing. To look like a princess. Do you know? In fact, it doesn't matter what you wear or how you look anymore. You are the most beautiful thing that ever entered my life, Amazon girl. In, in, in. May I have this dance, please? Come on. [dance music] I love you. I love you. But? Peace, I... It's 12 o'clock, Cinderella. Are you curious about the rest of the tale? Then we go to the enchanted forest. [music] -Baris, why did we come here? -Shhh. Listen. Before everything know that doing this is the hardest thing in the world for me. Look Leaf... ... I can overcome any obstacle for you. But you have to get over the vines inside yourself first. If you still want me afterward, I'll be there for you. Peace... ... I'm sorry that I can't be a princess to ease your pain. No. You are a real princess. But... ... I'm not the prince in this fairy tale. To save the princess he loves... I am a selfless hunter who puts his own blood on his shawl. Go now. Maybe we'll meet again in another fairy tale, Amazon girl. [music] Peace. But? Do you love that much? Whenever a star falls... ... I'm using my wish so that that star passes in front of his window. Maybe I'm one of those who exaggerate, but I don't mind exaggerating. This place too... ...here too... ... this is hers. You are an enviable lover, Ali. I'm sure one day you will get the love you deserve. At least you have a chance to meet one day. I fell in love with an impossible person again and screwed everything up for myself. Tuna. It's so silly, isn't it? Bak Bade ... ... neither the Tuna thing nor your love is impossible. How so? Leaf told me. Tuna is nothing. So actually it's a secret, but... ... if it will save a heart from bondage... I am very sorry. Thing... ... for a moment I could not control myself. What will you do next? I will wait. until my last breath. Hoping one day those heels will tighten up. But this snow... Leaf? Leaf, what are you doing here? Why are you like this? calm down, okay? Everything is gonna be okay. Just tell me this. Did that guy do this to you? That guy is dead now. Don't go anywhere, I'm looking for the kids, I'll get you picked up. You did it. You did this to me, Ali. Because I handed you over to that guy myself? Approach. Leaf look, calm down, you will catch a cold. Put on that jacket. Do you think about me too much? Do you think too much of me? Then Ali, just be honest with me for once. Be honest! Behind... ... is your heart beating for him? Did you take me to Barış to meet Bade here? I saw you, he was kissing. Shall I be honest with you? My heart broke today when Barış told me that he loves me. I don't want to listen to this. You will listen! You will listen! My heart pounded because for a moment I wished it was you. But now I see that you don't even have the courage to say you love another girl. But as Barış brought me here today... ... he gave up his own love and pride and brought it. So, was he able to give up his childhood memories? -Or from tomorrow? -You're confusing me, don't do it. Love, pride. Shall I say the worst? Dreams with Leaf inside. Did he dare to give up on them? Neither Bade nor anyone else... ... I love you, Leaf. I've loved you since the day I found you crying twelve years ago right where you stood. I loved you every night, every morning, tirelessly. I am in love. Like crazy. I'm sorry but there is nothing else I can do! I love like dogs Leaf! Why did you do this? Why did you hurt yourself so much? I'm scared, little titan. I said no, I said no. I'm not afraid of losing my own life I was so afraid of losing you. I do not understand. I am hurting so much. Remember. When you were little, if you told me to be a cloud three times... ... I said that all your pain will pass. Be the cloud, be the cloud... ...become a cloud. Please pass. So are you sure you want me? The owner of this shoe I want. [music] What are you, a loser Cinderella who seeks help from fairies... ... nor am I a stupid prince looking for his love with a piece of shoe. Our story is different. [music] Then I'll collect the laundry. But first you need to wash them. [Leaf laughs] -Oh! -Down five. Ah! Bring your arm. It fit very well. So when are you going to stop beating me for falsehood? -Who? -Joyful. You nailed it with your ankle right. Let go now. Whenever I play with our children, I lose it. You make a difference whenever you play with them. But for some reason, when we play, I always win. They don't. Well, what should we do, I also win in love. I know this look. What went wrong little titan? No, there is nothing wrong. I am actually having the happiest time of my life. But now that we talked about children... ... do you think we should tell them? I thought about that too... ...but I have no idea where or how to say it. I mean, in case they say something, I... WTF? Let there be love. Ali, when were you planning to tell us? -Brother I... -Shhh. [clicks tongue] We are not blind, son. We loved it too, but... ... after some consultation with friends, we realized that... ... Ali bird is injured. Exactly. I wasn't going to do the talking, why are you interrupting? You're already talking, scarce. What was I saying? Ali is injured. You are injured, Ali. -It wasn't like that. -The other was better. We've reached the man who hurt you, Ali. And we brought it to your feet. Tuna! He himself. Tuna Karaman. You are stepping on the carpet. -Tuna Karaman, she's your lady Bade... -Don't step on the carpet, my son. Tuna Karaman, the guy who wrote to your wife Bade, brother. What about Oğuz, I'm going to drop the bomb, is it the turn of the carpet? Brother, drop your bomb before you step on the carpet. It takes your carpet, folds it, keeps the fold from its place... You are done! Do you know what the penalty is for detaining a person against his will? Not to mention the ill-treatment and torture. I was walking to Bade. I hope this intelligence will save you from being a ward tea seller. The love before your eyes... Shall we choke on a pizza?
