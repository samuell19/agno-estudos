[bird calling] [man speaking native language] [Kirk] All right, let's go. We'll be back in ten hours. If we're one minute longer than that, don't wait. Get the hell back to base. All right, hold on. Just a minute. We should be getting fairly close to the objective now. Look, we got off the boat here. We've come to the northwest. - Which means we have to go... -So we go there. ...that way. Okay. Let's move out. - Right. -Let's go. [Polo] And on the way back, we'll take care of that radar base we spotted. [Mike] Yeah, right. [Mike] How many of them are there? One... two... three... four, five. I see five, but I don't know how many are inside the shack. Okay, listen. I'm going to rush the shack. Now you stay here and wait for my signal. - You hear me? -[Mike] Yeah. -[soldier] Right. -Okay. [bird chirping] [soldier grunts] [Kirk] Children, don't be frightened. I've... I've come to take you home. It's all right. You'll be fine. Just sit there, all right? All right, listen. When I give the signal, all of you run out of here fast, okay? [imitates birdcall] [screams] [muffled grunts] [neck cracks] [grunts] Okay, hurry, go. Come on. Go. Come on. [machines humming] Listen, we gotta find a way to surprise them. Now... I'm gonna knock out that radar, you take care of the children and kill as many of those guys as you can. oK8)'- [man speaking native language] [Kirk] Let's go. Follow me. [Polo] All right, you kids, sit down... and don't move. [speaking native language] [soldier grunts] [machine gun firing] [soldier speaking native language] [grunts] [hand grenade clicks] You okay? I stepped the wrong way. Don't worry, kid. I'll be all right. You better look after the children. I'm okay. Go ahead. Right. Should we wait for Kirk? Yeah. Boss, are you all right? I'm awfully tired. Two lost men and a half-dead boss. Who the hell's kids are they anyway? The President? Come on, let's go. -[Mike] Polo? -[Polo] Yeah? [Mike] He's worse. He's not gonna make it. I don't think he can take ten more steps. [Polo] Then there's only one thing we can do and we gotta do it. Sit down, kids. Just a little further, okay? Yeah, fine. [grunts] - I gotta take the bullet out. -You can't do that. He'll bleed to death if I don't. Hey, boss, you decide. It's dangerous either way. Yeah, I know that. All right. Go get some bandages. Right away. Relax, boss. Oh, Christ. [Polo] Are you ready? Yeah, I... I am ready. It's gonna hurt a bit. All right, just... [chuckles] [coughs] Take your time. You know damn well I've done this before, so don't move. No, yeah... I won't. I believe you, but you better let Mike hold you. You might make a rash movement. Yeah. You know... the sooner you start, the sooner it's over. You know it's near the heart. [Coughs] I can... I can feel it when I... Every time I breathe. Then just breathe a little, and slow. Yeah, okay. It's dangerous, isn't it? Goddamn right it's dangerous. Well, just according to how deep I have to dig. You know, you're a funny guy. When you get the bullet out... you'll stop? Yeah, I'll stop. Here we go, boss. - Just hold on. -[Kirk screaming] [Polo] Grab on to him, Mike. Steady, steady. I'm going after it. I found it. You're doing great. You're doing great, boss. Hold on to him, Mike. Keep holding on. [Kirk screaming loudly] Here it is, the bastard. Easy, boss. Christ, I'm cold. All right? Yeah, but it's so cold. Let's get going. [grunting] [exhales] Come on. Gimme those, soldier. You won't be needing 'em. I'm going somewhere else. What? You outta your mind? Just you get 9omg- Why didn't he kill us? That was his only mistake. [phone ringing] [ringing StoP5] [phone resumes ringing] - What is it, Kirk? -[Kirk] We found him. - Where are you? -At the gym. Nothing else counts when your boss calls, right? - I don't have a boss. -Yes, you do. It's not the first time you've left me and rushed off. You know you shouldn't ask me about my work. I don't even know what you do. You could be smuggling. You could even be a spy, for all I know. All those things put together. Will I see you again? At the bar, later. To say goodbye. To say goodbye? You're leaving? I certainly hope so. [grunts] [glass breaking] Where is he? Ever since we got knocked out of Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia have become the hottest places in the world and our presence there is practically nil. Well, don't give me a lesson. Where's Polo? Well, I have it on the best information that Polo is buying arms from the KGB. Oh. So, Polo's with the KGB? And then... he sells the arms to the Cambodian guerillas, who then use them against the Chinese-trained Vietnamese. What do we care? We care because Polo uses the profits to buy drugs. He sells them to the mafia, who then smuggles them into the United States. So, he's working for the mafia? No, no, Polo works for himself. Now, what I'm asking you is to deliver a message to Polo from me. Me? You mean us. This is the zone you must reach. It is an area between the undefined borders of Cambodia, Thailand and Laos. It's a hot place. -[Mike] How hot? -Very hot. [Kirk] Someone's always shooting at someone. There's always guerilla warfare going on. -[pouring water] -But, more importantly, there's the Golden Triangle, where most of the world's drugs come from. That involves billions and billions of dollars. My contact? He's not really a contact. Well, you've got somebody over there? Not exactly. Your contact there is an old French lady who landed there when it was still a colony. Her name is Madame Fra. Matter of fact, she runs a whorehouse. It's very popular. And this woman knows where Polo is? [man 1] Her brother is nearby, and that is where Polo holds his mobile camp. He's always on the move. Always busy. [man 2] That's right. Apparently, he never stays anywhere for more than three clays at a time. He picks up drugs in one place and arms in another place and delivers everything in a different place. Well, you still haven't told me what Madame Fra has to do with it. [Secretary] From time to time, she sends her girls over to the camp. So she nearly always knows where Polo is. [Mike] And she's gonna tell me? She's expecting you, but not as a CIA agent. She's expecting you to make a deal with Polo. [Kirk] Hi. - Hi, Mike. -Hey. Listen, I'll call you when you get to Bangkok. Okay, Kirk. I'll just say goodbye to Sharon and then I'll be leavin'. Who's Sharon? Sharon Morris. She's over there, takin' the sun. Now wait a minute. How long have you known her? Not long. Why? Well, does she know the kind of work you do? Nothing. What's there to know? I'm just a veteran, trying to get ahead like everybody else. I know, but look, uh, I'm gonna get some information on her. Get your information. -[chuckles] Okay. -Bye. - See you soon. -See you. Enjoy yourself. -[Kirk] I'll miss you. -Okay. Can anyone kiss you like that? I recognized the style. Goodbye. I'm leaving. Where are you going? You know I can't tell you where I'm going. When will you be back? That I could tell you, but I really don't know. Sorry. Okay, I'll come with you. There're no pools or hotels there, Sharon. Where are you going? Goodbye, Sharon. I won't be here when you come back. Sharon, maybe you haven't understood. What I've gotta do is important, so important that I'm gonna risk losing you. See you. Could be. As you know... Mike is one of our best agents. He was sent on this dangerous mission and he might not come out alive. We were just discussing that. I know what we were discussing! Have you asked yet for that report on the investigation on Sharon Morris? [man] Uh, listen, Kirk, in our profession, we tend to exaggerate. Maybe Miss Morris is going to visit a sick aunt. That's nonsense. Taxi. [taxi driver] Yes, sir. - Here you go. -Thank you. [sighs] [phone rings] Hi, Kirk. Hello, Mike. How are you? Great. Couldn't be better. How do you like Bangkok? Well, if you'd called me a little later, I could've told you. I've only seen what I could from the taxi. [laughs] Listen, go for a ride around town. Someone will come up to you and tell you how to get the taxi to Madame Fra's. I'll call you later. Okay, bYe- I get the impression that this Mike Martin simply doesn't realize what he's in for. - We've discussed that point. -Yes, I know. It sounds more like he's taking a holiday. Mike is perfectly aware of the danger he's in. But for the time being, he stays on holiday. - Hi, Kirk. -[Sharon] Hello, Mike. - Sharon? -Ooh, aren't you clever? - Where are you? -In the lobby. - Here? -Where else? Well? I'll be right down. I'll order you a beer. It's a small world, huh? [chuckles] Avery small world. And what brings you here? - A boat. -Huh? I was offered a photographic assignment on the boat people. You know, those people, refugees who are forced to live on boats because no country will take them? Anyway, I grabbed it. How'd you find me? That was a coincidence. I was sitting in the lobby and the bellboy came around calling your name. There's a message for you. Here. Corner of Boulevard King and Rue Thep, ten o'clock. Sorry, Mike, my curiosity got the best of me. So? So... is she pretty? [man] Mr. Martin, long distance. I already know, thanks. - Mike? -That's right. Michael Martin, in person. You're not alone? No. Trouble? No, I don't think so. Someone from New York. Yes. You can't say who it is. Right. Well... give me a hint, give me an idea. Go ahead. Sharon. Gotta hand it to you, you don't miss a trick. Now what? Leave right now. You have the departure of the taxi-bus? Yeah, I got it a while ago. I'm not kidding, Mike. Leave right now. That wasn't a very enthusiastic call. Bye. Will I see you again? - Later. -Sure? No. [man whistles] [all grunting] [grunting continues] [Mike] Just a minute. Here I am. - Good morning. -[man] Guten Tag. [man] Ja, I know what you're thinking, but it is amazing, most amazing indeed. Miles and miles of opium poppies, as far as the eye can see. Look at them, you see what they are doing? When the poppy has lost its petals, they cut into it very delicately and what comes out gets made into opium, much, much opium. All done in the open. In this and several other countries, it is easily their major source of income. It's my first time here. - Also at Madame Fra's? -Yes, of course. At the hotel, they told me that... All true. You'll find them of every age. Really? I guarantee you. If I went with a ten-year-old back in Dusseldorf, I'd be arrested for sure, even though a ten-year-old here is like a thirteen-year-old back there. But, after all, it's the looks that count, eh? Yeah. [women laughing] [man mumbling] Ah, there's Madame Fra. Hurry. Come, come. [Mike] Excuse me, could you call Madame Fra? Do you understand English? A few words. Would you tell her there's a man here to see her from America? Yes. Madame. Madame. Hey, American. Ayutta will take you to my room and I'll see you there in a bit. I'll set up the tourists, or perhaps I should say my very generous patrons. oK8)'- [Madame Fra speaking French] Come, girls. [Mike] Who's that? Monsieur Andre Malraux, Madame Fra's god. Listen, little girl, can I have a bath? Tub is there. Yeah, I noticed, but I also noticed there's no hot water. I bring you water. Thanks. Hurry up, American, or the water will get cold. It has taken exactly one hour to heat it up, to bring it, and to pour it into the tub. Now then, mon petit, what exactly is it that you want from Polo? No one can get to Polo, you know that? You can only be brought to him. Of course, I happen to know where he's holding his camp right now, but in two or three days, he's sure to vanish, disappear just like that, you understand? And God alone knows where he'll be then. Ah, you are such a handsome man. Stand up now. Let me dry you off. You know, I would like to lie with you, but I know you wouldn't like it too much. Voila. So, I am going to send you one of my very best girls to keep you company tonight, and then tomorrow, you can go see your friend Polo. After all, what would you do with an old woman like me? You never know. Don't worry. You have been kind to tell me that. As a reward, you will have the loveliest, the most expert of all my girls. [speaks French] You can empty the tub in the morning. I'm waiting for one of Madame's girls now. Go on, kid. I told you, I'm waiting for someone. It's me. Don't you like me? It's you what? I'm very good. I'm sure you are. But good at what? Christ, you're no more than a baby. Get outta here. Don't send me away. - Madame would... -I won't send you away. It's okay. [Ayutta] I'll be next to you. If you want me, take me. If you don't, do as you please. All I wanna do is sleep. I'm really tired. Polo's camp is about ten kilometers east of here, on the other side of the river. How do I know? Because I supply his girls. Once you are across the river, you will find animal traps, quicksand and wild beasts. But the real beasts are Polo's men. Thanks, ma'am, for everything. For what? For a bath and a room? For someone who's going to be dead within an hour? That's the least one can do. Hey, American. Why don't you come back, go to your luxurious hotel in Bangkok? I'll be back. Bye, little girl. Bye, Madame. I'm going to go with the others down to Polo's camp tomorrow. It's not your turn, you know. But if you like, you can go. Only I don't believe you'll find your American. [speaks French] -[elephant grunts] -[shouting in native language] [dog barking] [dog barking] [dog growling] Let me down, I got a message for Polo. What message? Get me outta here, you bastard. I got a meeting with Polo. Are you sure Polo's expecting you? [Hank] Hey, Jimmy, where's Polo? In a meeting, some bigwigs. Right. [man 1] I have been assured by my department -that the next shipment... -[Hank] Polo. ...will take place in two weeks. [man 2] Punctual deliveries are the basis of our business deals. There can be no deviation. It's a matter of principle. [man 1] Yes, yes, I know. You have my word that nothing will be changed. What is it, Hank? Have you been expecting an American? No. We've got one. He says he's got a message for you. - Who are they? -Oh, farmers who don't like working in the fields or who try to sell on their own... or who just don't produce much. [Polo] Well... - They're supposed to be shot. -What are you waiting for? Your order. What are you doing here, Mike? Hey, just hanging around. Can you let me down? What do you want? - Wanna make you a deal. -What deal? [Mike] Can you get rid of this guy? [Polo] There's nothing you can say that he shouldn't hear. Cooper sent me. Listen, I have to pee. - Go ahead. -Go ahead. [Mike] You come any closer, I'll do it in your mouth. That way, I won't dirty up the floor. All right, put him down. [grunts] [groans] - Would you get me a beer? -Get out. Would you tell him to get me a beer? Go on, get over there. You go ahead, Hank. Look, I'm in a hurry. I got a meeting to go to. - With who, the Russians? -Listen, I told you I was in a hurry. Now what's our friend Kirk Cooper doing? He must've made it good in the CIA. So good that you're here as his messenger boy. Who would ever imagine it? Kirk, our boss. No, no. Your boss. No, I'm on holiday. Are you kidding? You trying to be funny? You weren't funny then and you're not funny now. I want to buy all your drugs at a better price. Listen, you gotta stop dealing with the Russians and the Cambodians and the Laotians and the mafia. You'll get... Whatever you need you can get from us. No, from them. I'll have to do a little calculation. The America market is expanding. If I sell X, I'll earn Y... and the mafia will increase its monthly demand. You can understand that, can't you? Yeah, I can understand, and when I get back, I'll tell them. You aren't telling them nothing. I don't need your help to find the CIA. As far as I'm concerned, your role has ended here. Hang him up, Hank. I got more to tell you. Yeah, I know. You wanna tell me the price, huh? But the price, if I accept, will be what I say. Stop, Hank. When are you gonna kill me? I need you, Mike. The mafia made it bad for me with the Russians and now I can say the Americans wanna make a deal with me. - At a better price. -Yeah, at a better price. By this time, Mike has made contact. -[Secretary] That means he's... -He's not dead. But he has been captured. Then it's only a matter of time before they kill him. Polo will show Mike to the Russians. And then? Depends on Polo's mood, what he decides. Uh, Mike has been in this situation before. Do you think he'll get out of it? He always has. [chimpanzee chattering] Ah, the man with the money. Here are the girls, father. Take good care of them. My pleasure, Madame. - You know, father... -Here you are. ...l don't really care much for money, but... "Give unto Caesar what belongs to Caesar. Thirty-three stabs." Mmm, perhaps. [Mike grunts] Sharon. What are you doing here? I've come to stop you. You're with Polo. We use Polo. Do you and your stupid bosses think you can buy everything with your usual American psychology? You offer money to Polo, we offer him more. Try to understand, Mike. What's going on in Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam doesn't concern you anymore, and all the money in the world can't stop us. Judging by the way you talk, you're somebody pretty important. Can you get me a beer? [speaking native language] [gun clicks] You sure you ordered me a beer? -Ice cold? -Talk, Mike. Sure. What do you want to talk about? What did you tell Polo? Mmm, nothing. We just talked about old times. I know about the offer. I told you everything. [grunts] [chuckles] What's wrong, Sharon? Listen, it's going to be very difficult for you to walk out of here alive. So, you help me, and I'll try to help you. - Mmm-hmm. -Okay? Otherwise, Polo will hand you over to his lndo-Chinese friends, and you know they don't like Americans. -[Mike] That's a nice thought. -Mmm-hmm. I told you everything I know. Polo has to talk to Kirk if he decides to... No, Polo can't leave us. That's your problem. [door opens] [Polo] What were you saying, Mike? Hey, I asked her for a beer, and she said yeah. Any objections? Nope. Cheers. Well... [sighs] Well what? What were you saying? Oh, yeah. She said if I told her the truth, she'd shoot me. And if I don't, she'll turn me over to your Chinese friends, who just love American meat. [chuckles] Listen, Sharon, this is a business deal. Your people have been examining the situation. Maybe they've decided. - Let's go join them. -Okay. You gonna leave me on the ground or put me back up in the sky? On the ground. If he moves, shoot him. [people chattering indistinctly] [players shouting] [all shouting happily] [men laughing] [all clamoring] [Polo] Well, have you decided? [laughing] [dog barking] [soldier grunting] [both grunt] - Here we go. -Yes. [Mike] Stay down. [lighter clicking] What are you trying to do? Hey, what the hell? [dog barking] [men groaning] [screaming] [man] Come on. GO, go! [men shout indistinctly] Tell Madame Fra what happened. Tell her they'll be here any minute. I'm gonna go get the motorcycle. Hurry. [Ayutta] Madame. Madame. [Madame Fra speaking French] You look so upset. Aren't you happy I let you go? I saw Mike with you. ls everything okay with Polo? Well, what is it? There's trouble? Oh, my God. [fuel sloshing] [cranking] It's the end. I escaped from the Japanese, the French, the British, the Khmer Rouge. Polo's going to kill me. This time, my luck's run out. We've got to leave, Madame. How? Where? Mike will fix the motorbike. [chuckles] That thing? It's rusted, it's broken. There are bound to be parts missing. It's just old junk. It won't even start. Go while you have the chance. Unless a miracle happens, little one, we've come to the end of our lives. [engine starts] It is a miracle. Only you Orientals don't believe in miracles. [engine idling] [Mike] Where's Madame? She's gone to get her treasures. Get in. [curses in German] What can I do? [speaks French and Russian] -L've got to get away with all my money. -[Mike] Madame. I'm coming, arnaki mou. I'll be right there. Andre, protect me. Madame! I'm finished, min skatten, I'm coming. Madame. You cover the door and the window. As soon as they come, you shoot. We can't let 'em know how many we are. We are still only two, Mike. [grunts] -[Mike] That's better. -Mmm-hmm. [vehicles approaching] Come on, all of you. Get out. Surround all the buildings. We gotta find out how many of them there are. Over there. [all screaming] [Polo] All right. Front line, move in. [gun cocks] [exclaims] Shoot now. Hey, come here. You know what? We're gonna get out of this thing. - But-- -Shh. When I'm in trouble, I always become optimistic. Go on. [gunfire continues] Take a hand grenade and throw it. - At who? -At no one. Hurry. We haven't got many. We'll waste it. It's a gift with the company's compliments. Go on. Listen, I'll be right back. [gunfire] There's some more on the hill. Up there. [soldiers scream] Ahhh. Fan out in back of the barn. [grunts] What's happening over there? - There are two on the rock. -Shoot them. [screams] I'd better hide these outside somewhere. We might need them later. You never know. Come back quickly, Mike. In just a few minutes. And what do I do? Think of me. [Sharon] When do we move? [Hank] Any orders? Hank, get goin'. Get some men out. -[gunfire] -[screams and grunts] [grunts] [sighs] - We gotta get outta here. -Where do we go? Let's go visit Madame. Go, American. [speaks French] Andre will help you. [all grunting] [Mike] Be right back. Go get him. [grunts] Psst. Come on. [man grunts] He's not alone. They have bombs, rifles, machine guns and ammunition. And plenty of balls. Right. -L'm going out to count them. -And me? Go to the window and try to shoot someone. But I don't know how to shoot. As I said, try to shoot someone. - Mike? -Yes? If... Don't worry. I'm coming right back. When the hell are they going to start making rifles for ladies? [soldier grunts] - All right, listen. -Yes, Mike. - We gotta get outta here. -Well, let's go. - Where? -Let's try the roof. Okay, come on. Come on out. Ayutta... over there. There's a woman. Yeah. Sharon. [Madame Fra] You know her? -[Mike] I thought I did. -Damned whore. [Mike chuckles softly] Females are one thing or the other, women or whores. I lived all my life as a whore, but I'm a woman. She's probably lived as a woman, -but she's a whore. -[chuckles] [Madame Fra] You can laugh, but I'm an expert in certain matters, American. You've got us into a lot of trouble, haven't you, mon barbu? The only advantage is that it won't take long. [Ayutta] You're coming right back, Yes, Mike? And me? Over there. Madame, you take that corner. Be right back, Madame. Just return, mon ami. -[gun firing] -[men grunt] [Sharon] Inside. Come on, move. Go on. - Whore. -[grunts] Ayutta. No. It's not fair. Come on. Hey, God wants you. [grunts] -[gun fires] -[grunts] [Polo] Get the hell in there. Move. [man grunts] [gun clicks] [whimpering] In all her life, listen to me, Mike, in all her life, you are the only man who didn't treat her like an animal. If I'd treated her like an animal, she wouldn't be like this now. I am sure that she preferred it this way. Goodbye, American. You're staying? Where would I go? I have lived all my life here, and here I will die. But don't worry about me. I can always find a few native girls to offer to the Western world. Hey, American... ...it was that blonde who killed Ayutta. She really was a whore, you know? As soon as I called her that, she turned around immediately. I know where he is. How you doin', man? -[door closes] -Fancy meeting you here. We're working together this time. We need three elements for our next mission. How many are we? [all chuckle]
