Heavenly Father, we entrust to you the spirit of your servant, William Medina. And we are comforted by the true hope that he will resurrect with Christ on the last day. You, who lives and reigns forever and ever. Amen. Let his spirit and that of all the faithful ones for the mercy of God rest in peace. Give him, O Lord, eternal rest. - Let perpetual light shine upon him. Give him, O Lord, eternal rest. - Let perpetual light shine upon him. Give him, O Lord, eternal rest. - Let perpetual light shine upon him. Wait. Don't put that bag over my head. Where's the money? Come on, where is it? My brother has it. I don't have that money. Speak up, faggot. Speak up. Which brother? - The twin. Look me in the face. Which brother? The twin. He looks just like me. - Smartass. Hey, dude, tell me something, am I laughing? No, no. Don't put that shit over my head. I'm suffocating, I'm suffocating. We know you have it, so stop fucking around! Come on, faggot, speak up. Come on, faggot. You went too far. You screwed it up. No way. Pour some water on him and he'll wake up. - Water? Have you ever seen a man who fainted with his eyes wide open? This dumb-ass is a fucking slacker. Did I tell you to kill him? No, sir. So? Now ask him where the money is. Now we have to turn this house upside down, damn it. Did it bite you? No, no, stop pissing that animal off. What's up? Nothing? Look, son, this is the address. Hotel El Corso. Don't forget. I won't, sir. Go there and I'll call you later and give you instructions. All right. Hello? - Don Pablo, this is Victor. What's up, son? How's our business? So-so. It doesn't seem to be here. - What do you mean? Turn it down. Goddamn it! How come the money is not there? What did those patients say? There was only one of them. And what did the asshole say? - Nothing. That his brother knows where it is. - No way. Those fucking twins always come out with that shit. Make him spit it out. - Don Pablo, the guy kicked the bucket when we were pressing him. What? How could you kill him before you found out any shit? Did you search all over the house? It's upside down and we didn't find anything. That money is there. You can't leave without it. Don Pablo, hold on, somebody's at the door. Be careful. Who is it, Victor? A bald guy with a bunch of dogs in a van. Damn it. Is the other twin there? I don't know. I don't see him. Don Pablo, hold on, there's a cell phone ringing. Don't answer it. No, no way. Who's calling? I don't know, there's no caller ID. You know what, Victor? You better get lost. The other fucker could bring more heat. Guys, we have to get the hell out of here. We need to go out through the back. That wall is very high, man. The dog's loose. - Tough luck. Fuck! DOG EAT DOG Iris, when do we start? We already did, boss. But it's taking forever. This is a black novena. We must pray for nine nights until dawn. A novena? No, Iris, that's not going to happen. With these things, you have to be careful. You're telling me that you want to avenge your godson's death. So I did what had to be done. And if we stop now, the dead man will fall upon us, and you don't know what that's like. Wouldn't it be better to shoot that rat? This is much worse. He really suffers with this. Something went wrong? Yes, sir, they didn't find the money. Are they pushing them? Yes, sir. But, well, only one of them was there and when they were pushing him, he died. Who's doing that job for you? Some of my guys from Tuluá. From Tuluá? Why Tuluá? I thought it would be better to have locals doing it near the house where the money was. What are you gonna do now? Because I need that money here right now! I'm on it, boss. Did you find the other twin? - Right now I'm-- No, Pablo! You are responsible for that money! You won't lose that money, boss. - Right, I won't lose it. Hello? - Where is Sierra? He's in the parking lot, sir. Tell him to come here. - Yes, sir. You know what, boss? I don't like working with Sierra. Yes, boss? You're helping Pablo fix some business that went wrong. Remember the money the twins brought from up north? The guys this man recommended? Don't tell me they fucked it up. I need you to find the other twin. And bring me my money, no matter what. Done, boss. We will fix that right away, won't we, Pablito? Who's responsible for getting the money? Peñaranda, Victor Peñaranda. I need you to bring that Peñaranda, and have him stay with our guy at the hotel. We're gonna hit the jackpot. Hi, Pipe. - Hi. Hey, go and get Gloria. - My aunt left. And my daughter? - She left with my aunt. How are you, Victor? Fine, Doña Teresa. I need to talk with Gloria and my child, urgently. They aren't here. They went to Cali to do some visa errands. Don't you know where they're staying? No, Victor, I don't. Fine, Doña Teresa. Thanks. Bye, Pipe. - Bye. Hello, this is Gloria Márquez's phone. Leave a message after the beep. Bye. Gloria, where are you? I really need to talk with you. Call me back as soon as possible. Bye, and kiss our child for me. Hello? Hello, Victor. Where are you? In Tuluá, Don Pablo. - I need you to come to Cali. What's wrong, Don Pablo? We located the other twin and we are going to make him talk. You are staying at a hotel called El Corso at the corner of 7th and 11th. You will meet the guy we're working with there. How much is this one? - The little dog is 20. I have 10. - Give me 15 and it's a deal. Hello, this is Gloria Márquez's phone. Leave a message after the-- - Yes? - I'm Victor Peñaranda. Room 216. Who is it? - Peñaranda. Don Pablo just called. He said we must wait here. Hello. What's up? Did Don Pablo say anything? No, I only know we are gonna kill some guy. A guy called Sierra is picking us up. Which Sierra? The Caucano? I guess so, why? No, nothing. I guess this is my bed. No, man. This one is yours. I have smoothed it out already. No, go ahead, man. Hello? - Who is this? Who are you calling? Excuse me, what is this place? - A hotel, man. A hotel? And is Adela there? No, wrong number, man. - Sorry. I'm gonna go get some cigarettes. Hello, this is Gloria Márquez's phone. Leave a message after the beep. Where is that fucking bitch? Hello? - What hotel is this? What? - What's the name of this hotel? I don't know, man. This is important. Can you get Adela on the phone? They're here to pick us up, man. Who? A guy in a white truck. Fuck. Another joke. A dealer who hired a fucking black guy just like this one. About 6 feet and 12 inches. "I need you to fuck everyone I bring over." The black man says, "All right, boss, whatever you say." So the boss brings him a guy about 20 years old. I need you to fuck him in the ass until you get tired. "All right, boss. Take him to that room and I'll do my job." And 10 minutes later, he brings another man and says to the black man: "I want you to take his eyes out and cut his tongue off." The black man says, "All right, boss, take him to that room, and after I ass-fuck the young one, I'll take this one's eyes out and cut his tongue off." So the boss leaves again and comes back later, and brings another man to cut his hands and balls off. And every 10 minutes was the same story, and he shoves them into the same room. Then the 20-year-old becomes nervous and says: "Hey, don't forget you only have to fuck me in the ass." Look what the cat dragged in. What's up, brother? Fine, man. What's that hoop for? To practice the grip. How's that? When I catch something, it knows it can't get away. For grip? This guy is full of shit, man. For the grip. Maybe you're just nervous because that's for the nerves. For the grip! You dumb-ass. We can arm wrestle whenever you want to, and you'll be surprised. Whenever, jerk. People are full of shit, man. People think it's a matter of brute force, but it's a matter of technique. Hey, Sierra, what is it that we're gonna do? We are going to the cemetery to see if the twin goes to his brother's funeral. What do you mean? Thing's fucked up, bro. Right, Peñaranda? Heavenly Father, we entrust to you the spirit of your servant, Alberto Cardona, and we are comforted by the true hope he will resurrect with Christ on the last day. That asshole is not coming to his brother's funeral. You can tell he loved him a lot. He must be in one of the cars. I don't know. I don't think so, things are too hot. He's not coming. Where is Black Moon? Who? Black Moon. Our black guy, Benitez. He's over there looking at some graves. Watch out, that guy is a fucking SOB. Why do you think they call him that? Things just got worse, man. Victor, where is the money? What money, Don Pablo? What do you mean? I already told you, we didn't find anything in that house. That money was there. The boss kept an eye on those guys since they brought that money from the States. There was no way you could have failed. You know whose money that is, Victor? It's El Orejón's. Do you know who he is? I've heard about him, but I don't know him. Listen carefully. El Orejón asked me to collect that money, and now he's breathing down my neck. If I had it, would I be here? I'm not that dumb. Anything is possible, son. Hello? - Hello, Victor. What's wrong? Look, I need to talk with you about a couple of things. Tell me. How's the girl? Fine. And the other thing is? Look, I'm busy now. Can I call you in a while? But answer the phone, would you? Look, Victor, you are always busy, so stop calling. Leave me alone. Look, son, I won't get killed for what I haven't stolen. If you have that money, give it to me. Give it to me and I'll find a way to fix things. If you don't have it, we're fucked because El Orejón has all his people on this. Think about it. I'm tired of chasing those fucking rats. You kill rats with poison. No! Hello? Who's this? What? Who's this? Why? Who do you need to speak to? Adela. - Who? Adela, Adela Londoño. Wrong number, man. - What? Fuck off. Stupid asshole. Where do so many dogs come from? THE CHAINSAW MONSTERS ARE BACK THEY WENT FOR DRINKS AND GOT CHOPPED UP THE CHAINSAW MONSTERS HAVE NO MERCY Hey, why do you clean that thing so much? I have always liked to keep my guns clean. That's just fancy stuff. When it comes down to a shooting, it's useless. Really? This is like having three pieces in one. If it doesn't get jammed. Hello? - Please, get me the girl. Which girl? What do you mean? Adela. She's not here. How many times have we told you? If you don't know who I'm talking about, then get me the person in charge. Which person in charge, asshole? - Watch it, I'm not being rude. Look, motherfucker... - You don't know who you're talking to. Get me the person in charge, or tell me the name of that hotel or whatever, so I can go and fix this issue myself. Are you threatening me, asshole? - What did you just call me? You heard me. I can't stand this fucker anymore. You know what, man? Don't transfer any more phone calls. What? Do not transfer any more calls. I can't do that. Why can't you? Telephone lines here go straight to the rooms. What do you mean? Do you see a switchboard here? The telephone must remain hung up, okay? Hello? I've been waiting for you down here for more than 10 minutes. Who's been speaking on the fucking phone forever? We are coming down. Let's go, man. So, Benitez, are we going to the soccer game or what? America-Tolima, brother. What? Did Peñaranda infect you with his bitterness? Ouch, Peñaranda. You killed Benitez's spirit. Peñaranda is like a friend of mine who didn't like anything. A fucking bitter, harsh guy. I used to tell him, "Have fun, asshole, have fun." But he wouldn't. He only cared about twisted business until the day a Negro got him and bam! He threw him into a sewer and he drowned. Did you know that, Benitez? What? About the guy who was thrown into a sewer in Buenaventura a few days ago. Yes, I heard. Hey, Sierra, what is it that we're gonna do? We are going after some dogs. Whose dogs? Nobody's. Stray dogs, thieves. What's the problem? Here we are. This is your favorite radio station. It's 104F, live from Cali, the salsa music world's capital. Hello? Hello? Hey, Peñaranda, what about Gloria? What? Are you still going out with Gloria? Yes, why? I liked that girl. She's nice, isn't she? Well, there they are. The redheaded one is the twin. The gentleman is Don Omar, those fuckers' lawyer, and I don't know the other one. Don't kill this one too, there are no more twins left. Such a big deal to sell a fucking car. - It's something you have to do. What's up, twin? What's up, Sierra? Nothing, I had been looking for you to offer my condolences, but I didn't know if the one they killed was you or your brother. Fucking car. Stand still. Lie down, dude. Fuck! Fuck. It's gonna be fucking hard to find that fucker again. What's wrong? This shit has had a gas leak since yesterday and I haven't found it. I'm pissed off. Isn't there another car? You think this is a movie or what? We have to drive with an extra gas tank. Put those two back here. Lie down over here, man. What's the problem, Sierra? Money, Don Omar, as usual. What money? The money these fucking twins want to steal from the boss. Actually I came here to talk about that with Harold. Which Harold? - The twin. Then which one was the dead one? - Alberto. Alberto, the dead one. I see. Hold on one moment. Don't move, take it easy. Can you drive? - Why? I need someone to drive while I talk with these guys. Hey, Benitez, is that a toy gun or what? Because you didn't break a single window. Hey, where are we going? To the pool. - Which pool? The dog's pool. Well, Omar, now tell me, what do you know about the money? Harold told me that money was in the house in Tuluá, where Alberto was killed. If they had it, why didn't they hand it over? They couldn't reach El Orejón after the murder attempt. They were the ones who upset him, smartass. I know nothing about that, Sierra. I'm telling you what Harold told me, that the money was in Tuluá, and the one who killed Alberto stole it. Did you hear that, Peñaranda? This man says you stole the money. Who shall I believe? - I think we can make a deal, whatever. Don Omar, if you know nothing, I'm sending a message to the twin. Sure, Sierra, let's fix this. No, Don Omar. You are the message when they find you. What the fuck are you doing, man? He was speaking badly of you, man. We are in the middle of the street, dude. Start the car and keep driving. - Where to? Straight, to the river. That's why the gas tank is full of holes. Let's go to the pool, fuck! These animals became bad. They are killing each other. Pablo, you're out of this business. But, boss, we are really close, believe me. I almost got killed because I believed you. I had to clean things up because of you. And I'm taking care of as many rats as I have to because no one fucks with me. Things could have been done in a different way. How? Beating up each other? No, the one who fucked it up goes down. You know what? You're the only one, who after shitting on me like this, is walking out that door. Leave. Hello, this is Gloria Márquez's phone. Leave a message after-- Hi. Hello. Is Benitez in? Can I wait for him? No, you know what? I'll be back later. Hey, could you tell him I stopped by? What's your name again? Oh, my God, he who doesn't know his way walks in distress. Don Pascual, give me something to get rid of this. What, son? What they have done to you can't be fixed with herbs. What shall I do, then? Pray to God, as usual. This is black magic. Listen to me, black magic. If you want to live, you must go to the cemetery, exhume the corpse and take the bundle off his right hand. The same hand you have fucked up. You're terribly cursed, son. This thing is between you and the dead man. Find out who the dead man is because he's going to harass you every day until you are dry. Put this on your hand and wrap a bandage around it so it doesn't rot too fast. They are burning sugar cane again. What's going on, man? I thought someone broke in. Hey, can I borrow the newspaper? I'm almost done, young man. Goodbye, young man. Hello? Sir, please, I really need to talk with the girl. Which girl? - Adela. Look, fucking asshole, I'm gonna come beat you up, did you hear me? Don't make me get violent. - What? Don't make me get violent, man. Who do you think you're talking to? Fucking bastard. Come here right now, dumb-ass, you motherfucker! Hello? Who's this? - Victor, I really need to talk with you urgently. What's wrong? I'll tell you when you get here. Come to the Cafeteria Gallega. What's going on, Don Pablo? - I'm fucked, son. Victor, are you listening to me? Yes, sir. I'll be there in 10 minutes. No, son, let me tell you-- - No, no, I'm coming. What's wrong? Nothing, I fell down. Where are my candles? Who took them? I don't know. Maybe the cleaning lady. Can I help you? I would like a coffee and can I read the newspaper, please? Iris, this patient looks very calm. No, boss. Believe it or not, he's really fucked up. Fucked up? I'm the one who's fucked up, believing all that crap you tell me. Wasn't William's spirit supposed to torment him day and night? That's right, boss. Then why isn't that bastard rolling around with fear? THEY WERE CHOPPED ALIVE Hello, this is Gloria Márquez's phone. Leave a message after the beep. Bye. Gloria. Gloria, this is serious. Things got really bad and I might not be able to call you again. Please, call me back. Hello? - What's wrong, Victor? I need to see you, but right now. Wait there, don't hurry me. Where are you? - Tell me what's going on. I don't have time now, Gloria. I have to go or they're gonna kill me. Don't scare me, Victor. What did you get mixed up in this time? I can't explain it to you. Tell me where you are. Gloria, are you there? - Yes, yes, tell me. Well, tell me where you are and I'll pick you and the girl up right now. No, Victor, you tell me what's wrong right now. I took some money. You know, I was thinking about the girl and I can't back out now. Victor, leave us alone. I got the visa and next week I'm leaving with the girl. Don't you get it? If you don't come with me, they won't let you leave, and they're gonna kill you. Why are you doing this to us? - Tell me where you are! Hold on. Hold on one second. Don't hang up. Who is it? - I can't wait for you any longer, Victor. Hold on! Who is it? Thanks. Do you think I'm a clown or what, jerk? No, wait. Wait. Get it out! Get it out, motherfucker! Dumbass. Hello, this is Gloria Márquez's phone. Leave a message after the beep. Bye. What's up, man? How's the thing going? Fine, sir. Does that asshole have the money? Did you find it? No, sir. - So, what do you mean, "fine"? I searched all his stuff. He doesn't have anything. Only a cuddly dog. And? - I don't know, sir. Sometimes he calls his wife, but she won't answer. Well, keep an eye on him. I'm sure he knows something. Okay, sir. Have you heard about a guy whose name is... Was William Medina? No, I haven't. You haven't heard. That guy was killed. They threw him into a sewer in Buenaventura. You haven't heard that either? Yes, I heard. I have some people working on that, and we'll fix this at any moment. A cuddly dog. I like you. I'm going to give you a present. You see that square down there? Yes, sir. Choose someone. That one. The one with the notebooks? Yes, sir. Torres! Yes, boss. - Call Cucaracho. Boss. Hello, where are you? Very well, I have a patient for you. He's on 5th Avenue. No, no, on the other side. That one, the one with the notebooks. Look. Let me know what happens. Leave him to me until tomorrow, boss. I was about to finish him right now. The dead man has been grieving these days, and that's not good. So? Let him grieve. He hasn't done a thing because the Negro just got scared. He won't last longer than tomorrow. That's a fact, Iris. Come on, Peñaranda! Open the door, it's not the doorman. It's Black Moon's time, man. What do you mean? Yes, the boss already gave the order. He wants you to kill that fucking dog, but he wants you to do it tomorrow. Why not right now? I don't know. He works in mysterious ways. What's up, man? Come on, we're leaving! Come on, come on, hurry up. Wake up, they caught the twin. Let's go, move. Let's go! No wonder you call here, you fuckers. Hello? I won't say it again. You get my Adela on the phone or I don't know. What? Tell me, are you going to get her on the phone or not? Who? Are you making fun of me? Why should I, if I don't even know who I'm talking to? How come? I've been trying to speak with Adela for several days. Which Adela? - Adela. The hot chick? Show some respect, she's a lady. But she was hot, wasn't she? - What? Do you really want to speak with her? - Yes, please. Well, that's impossible. Right now she's busy. Call back later. But is she there? Yes, yes. No, I'm kidding, she's not. Stop being funny. You don't know who you're speaking to. Of course I know. But can I tell you the truth? She didn't come out with anything, so we had to take her guts out. Say that again. - You heard. It was even in El Caleño newspaper. Leave my Adela in peace. In peace she is, because she suffered... I mean, you don't even want to know. What did you do to her? What did you do to my Adela? That's so you don't think we're fooling around. He won't call back. Do you know that chick or what? Hello? - We are at the lot. Yes, okay. We have to leave now. Fine, I'll wait for you in the car. Come on, hurry up! I forgot to tell you to dress up. After we take care of this, we're going to a funeral. Whose? Don Pablito. He had a heart attack and died. I feel sorry for the old man. So you're the famous Victor Peñaranda. Yes, sir. Look what I have for you. We found him at the airport, ready to fly away. Too bad for the motherfucker, right? I had to bring both of you to find out where my dollars are. There was no money in that house, sir. We searched everywhere and we couldn't find anything. Fucking bastard! Tell him the truth, fucker! You took that money and killed my brother, motherfucker! I haven't stolen anyone's money. That man is accusing me to save his ass. Sierra? Yes, boss. Bring the tools. Done, boss. Well... Son, get the truth or the guts out of this dog, but I need to know what happened. I don't have that money, boss! I swear it, I don't have anything! Don't kill me. I'm not lying to you. Then kill me yourself! Don't let this fucker kill me! With that tool near, everybody tells the truth. You know what? I'll give you two hours to bring me my money or we bring your wife and daughter here so you can have fun with that tool. Fucking dog, who do you think you're dealing with?! Pablo left this for you. So? Aren't you going to open it? It could be money. Let's shoot that fucker up once and for all. Why don't you do it? Boss's instructions. You want me to shoot him with a stone, or what? Torres. Give the gun to this asshole. Give it to him. He knows he's fucked. So? I distract him and you shoot him. What's up, Benitez? Are we going to do some arm wrestling? I'm tired, so maybe you can beat me. Fuck off. Come on, let's see if that rubber hoop is good for something. I'll bet the gun. Do it, you monkey. No wonder you're lazy. Hey, motherfucker, shoot him. Release me, fucking bastard. What did you say about Negroes? Motherfucker. Here, so you don't fuck around with the blacks again, motherfucker. Do it, bro, do it. If you kill me, you won't have anyone to help you kill El Orejón. Because you have no choice. I know where that fucker could be. At Don Pablo's funeral. Let's go and get him. So are we splitting the money? Okay. Let's go and get them. In there, we don't have a chance. We have to do it out here. We have to wait, man. I'm stretching my legs. THIS TOMB WAS DESECRATED HE WAS TAKEN OUT OF HIS GRAVE AND PISSED ON Stop. Stop. Wait. What's wrong? Nothing, it turns off when it overheats, but I'll take off in five minutes. Maybe it's an electrical problem. No, it's not. This is gas, man. What happened there? A dog ran into the car. A dog? Get out. Johnny. Where's Adela? What did you do to my Adela, degenerate? What did you do with her? Where is my Adela? Where is Adela? Three pieces in one, man.
