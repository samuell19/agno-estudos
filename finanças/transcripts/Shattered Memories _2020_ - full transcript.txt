[quiet tense music] [insects chirping] [glass shattering] [Kelly grunting] [Kelly gasping] Yeah. [Kelly panting] [Kelly grunting] [dramatic rhythmic music] [Kelly panting] [gentle music] [horn honking] [tense music] [tires screeching] [phone ringing] [tires screeching] [horn honking] 911, what is your emergency? Please! Please help, I'm being-- [Kelly gasps] [horn honking] [metal and glass clattering] [people chattering] [gentle cello music] Now, this is what I love about Kelly Moore. The willingness to go beyond. I mean, she has conquered every canvas, but that wasn't enough. This sculpture, a wonderful expression of exploration. Thank you so much for coming. I'll make sure Logan gives you a call next week. Sounds great. How's the brilliant artist? Oh. You've been listening to Logan's sales pitch a little too closely. Keeps me entertained at these things. You don't have to stay if you don't want to. I wanna be here. Guess who just sold two more paintings and is this close to a bidding war on your latest sculpture? That's why I'm with you. Oh, maybe we should talk about a raise. Heads up. It's Applegate. You want me to handle it? No, no, I got it. Mr. Applegate, I didn't know you were looking to expand your art collection. Oh, I'd be willing to buy out your show here under the right terms. We've responded to your requests firmly before. Kelly, how 'bout we talk alone? You've been avoiding me. I tend to do that with disrespectful people. Well, there's nothing disrespectful about the offer. Except you can't seem to take no for an answer. I already have your card. Flip it over. [Kelly scoffs] [Reed chuckles] You'll wish you hadn't done that. I have guests. You know your way out. I love this one. Yeah? I'm trying to convince the firm to buy it so I can look at it every day. Lawyer? Yes, Chad Banks. Alison. Oh, I'm sorry, I thought you were Kelly Moore. Oh, no. This is my wife, but I'm Kelly's manager Logan. Oh, hi. So where's the artist? That is so wonderful to hear. I'm so glad you like it. Excuse me, too. So what can I tell you about this piece? Thank you. Excuse me. Are you Mrs. Moore? Yes. There's a piece over here that I'm interested in. Would you mind? One second. Any answers? I'll have my report ready soon. Have a job I have to finish up tomorrow, so stop by the office Monday. I'll have everything ready. Here. Thanks. Do you ever get tired of coming to these? No. [chuckles] Liar. You don't have to stay if you don't want to. Oh, come on, you'd notice. This is work. I don't expect you to suffer through it. Logan expects me to stay. Well, remember he works for me. [Kelly chuckles] Do you wanna get outta here? Girls night? But don't you have to take Dan to the airport tonight? Yeah, right. Well, another night then? Sure. [plane engine rumbling] [Dan sighs] All right. Text you when I land. Get something to eat. I had lots of shrimp at the gallery. That's not a meal. You didn't see how many shrimp I ate. Yeah, you did have a lotta shrimp. Yeah. [both laughing] I'll see ya on Tuesday. Fly safe. I love you. I love you, too. [gentle music] [insects chirping] [doorbell ringing] [suspenseful music] [glass shattering] Please help I'm being-- [glass and metal clattering] [tense music] [monitor beeping] [respirator hissing] [Kelly sighing] [tense music] Kelly. Let me just get the doctor. She's awake. Can we get a doctor? How you feeling? She'll still be a little groggy. I think it'll be a good idea to give her some space. Okay. Kelly? My name is Dr. Milner. [people chattering] You were in a car accident last night. You hit your head pretty hard. My head hurts. Hmm. We can get you something for that. Hey. Who are you? Honey, it's me Dan, your husband. Kelly? What is the last thing you remember? [Dan grunting] Logan. Hey guys. Thanks for coming. Yeah, of course. You said she has amnesia? Are they sure? Looks that way. So she doesn't remember anything. I don't know how bad it is yet. How is she physically? Well, she's okay. Mr. Moore. So right now things are a little foggy for her. Your wife's original CT scan showed intracranial hemorrhaging. It's subsiding now so things look better than when she first arrived. She remembers her family although she told me they passed away? That's right, yeah. But she doesn't know me. Growing up, school, college, all those memories are intact. It's after that it gets a little hazy. What about me? We were roommates in college. As the hemorrhaging continues to subside, her impairment should diminish. So she should start to remember. That's our hope. And what can I do? I mean, should I bring things from home or? It wouldn't hurt. Just be patient. As difficult as this is for you, it's worse for her. [horn honking] [people chattering] [monitor beeping] [Kelly panting] [tense music] [eerie music] [dramatic music] [Kelly gasping] [Kelly panting] It's all right. Hey, it's all right. It's all right. It's okay, I'm here. [Kelly panting] Kanya, I know this is a lot for you right now. Alison is just outside. Do you want me to bring her in? Excuse me. Detective Vance. I have some questions for Mrs. Moore about her accident. Hi. The doctor filled me in on your condition. Sorry about all this. [people chattering] Why do you think he's here? Have no idea. 911, what is your emergency? Please! Please help, I'm being-- [Kelly gasps] [glass and metal clattering] [quiet tense music] So you have no recollection of what might have caused your distress or the wreck. Maybe you had car failure or road rage. [Kelly grunting] [glass shattering] A window, a window at a house. Okay. When the officers stopped by your house, they noticed a broken window. What? Yeah, on the second floor. You didn't see it? No, I came straight from the airport. I haven't been home yet. Dan, I'd like to talk to your wife alone for a minute if I could. Sure, okay. Thanks. Everything all right? Kelly called 911 right before the accident. And apparently there's a broken window at the house. Someone break in? I don't know. May I sit here? Sure. [monitor beeping] So, uh, officers haven't seen any sign of foul play at the accident just wreckage of the parked car. I have very few pieces and honestly some of them are a little worrisome. That's why they turned it over to me. But you don't remember anything, anything at all? Nothing that I'm sure of. I have these moments when I see things, but I don't know if they're memories. It just seems like on that call at that time you felt like you were in danger. Do you still feel like that? [glass shattering] [Kelly gasping] [eerie music] [tense music] That window. I think, I think someone pushed me out of it. Maybe someone was trying to kill me. Okay. Is everything all right? Yeah. I wanna see your house. Sure. But I don't wanna leave her alone. We can stay with her. Okay. I'll be back soon. I wish I knew more. With Dan, I feel like I'm hurting him. It's not your fault you don't know him. Kelly, you are the smartest, most talented person that I know, all right? And just because you've forgotten a few faces or names that doesn't change who you are. Logan, can you get us something to eat? Um, sure, yeah. Kelly, are you craving anything? Alison? Okay. I'm sorry. I know everyone means well. I just don't know them. Well, I'm glad you remember me and that you're safe. Alison, someone tried to kill me. They pushed me out a window. You sure? I mean, do you have any idea who? I don't know. I'm not sure of anything, but I can just feel it, like I'm in danger, but I just don't know why or from who. You're safe. Am I? [sighs] Hey, let's focus on what you can remember. Um, I can remember college and our apartment with that crazy yellow carpet. But nothing after that. It's like I know something is there, but when I try to remember, it's just like a gray wall. You must have a ton of question. I know most of what's missing so fire away. Okay, how did I meet Dan? [gentle music] Well, he was watching his nieces and he brought them to a painting workshop that you were doing. Really? Mmm hmm. Yeah, I remember you just melting at how sweet he was with the kids. [Kelly sighs] And you dated for a couple of years. And then you asked him if he was ever gonna have the guts to ask you to marry him. No, did I? Yeah. [Kelly chuckles] He's easygoing and sweet. You're both happy I think. And Logan, he seems nice. Must be why I married him. And you've been married-- Three years. And Logan works for me. How did he come to be my manager? Well, he's always had a flair for sales and sometimes I think he is your biggest fan. So who better to sell your art. Ah, it's a shame I can't remember. I never would have thought I could turn art into a career. Oh, you definitely have. I mean, you have it all, Kelly. [tense music] Do I? What do you mean? If I did, I wouldn't be here. [insects chirping] It must be hard with Kelly not remembering you. Yeah, I'm having a little trouble wrapping my head around it to be honest. I bet. So you were out of town? Business? Yeah, Chicago. So what do you do? Accounting. I had an audit to do for a client. And Kelly, she's an artist? Yeah, she has a gallery downtown. Do you know anybody who would wish her ill? I don't think so. What, do you think she was attacked? Well, let's go look inside. [ominous music] [slow suspenseful music] There's nothing out of place down here. Everything looks to be in order in here, too. [Detective Vance sighing] Well, it looks like this window was broken from the inside. Is my wife in danger, Detective? Your wife thinks that somebody pushed her through the window. What? [Dan pants] But we need evidence. Your wife's injuries coulda come from the crash and they coulda come from a combination of that window and the crash. Or maybe the window has nothing to do with her accident. What about the 911 call? Ah, that's the one detail that makes me think maybe there's more to this. [people chattering] [gentle music] [ominous music] [Kelly gasps] Who's there? [Kelly panting] Oh, you really shouldn't be up. Here. I, I thought I saw someone. Easy. Are you all right? I think so. Lie back, slow, easy. Things have healed up nicely over the past week. Based on your tests and vitals, I'm comfortable to release you today. Oh that's good. And what about her memory? In the majority of cases this is temporary. How long it lasts usually depends on how severe the injury. There's nothing we can do but wait it out. I recommend you go back to your normal routine and get used to things again. Great. It may be awkward at first, but you are very lucky. You still have your sense of identity and your longer term memory. I'm confident the rest will come. [tense music] It's gonna be okay. [somber music] Which window? Had it replaced this morning. I thought it would be better for you if everything was back to normal. Yeah. [gentle music] You hungry? Yeah, actually. Well, why don't you take a look around the house and I'll make you a sandwich. Oh, uh, before I forget. Your phone was mangled pretty bad in the crash so I got you a new one. Oh. It's the same number. I tried to set up everything I could. [gentle music] Oh, thanks. [Kelly sighs] [Kelly exhales heavily] [door creaking] [Kelly sighs] [tense music] [somber music] [Kelly sighing] [bird wings fluttering] [Kelly screaming] [Kelly gasps] [sinister music] [Kelly panting] [doorbell ringing] Thank you. Have a good one. These are for you. Oh. "Everything happens for a reason." [huffs] What is that supposed to mean? Does it say who it's from? It's not signed. [water trickling] [Kelly sighing] Thank you. There you go. So any of it coming back? [gentle music] Feels familiar but nothing else. [Kelly sighs] Do you believe me? That someone was in the house with me? That someone pushed me out the window? Of course. I know you don't know me right now, but I'm scared, too. Okay, we're in this together. Thank you. [Kelly sighs] I just wish I could remember what happened. Well, Detective Vance said that there's no sign of any break-in, but someone had to have gotten in. Then it musta been someone I trusted enough to let into the house. How many people would that be? Fair number. Logan and Alison, couple people from my work, but I can't see them showing up out of the blue. There's Mark and Rita up the street. I have a cousin that lives downtown. I mean, she visits now and then and so do my parents, but they're out of state. But you also meet a lot of people at the gallery so there's probably some I don't even know. A gallery? Where is it? It's downtown. Can you take me there? [suspenseful music] Is it bringing anything back? [sighs] No. But it feels familiar. Oh well, the studio space is through here. You spend most of your days here. Wow, it's so-- Messy? [chuckles] Exactly like it should be. Is it really mine? Yeah. [door buzzer buzzing] I'll see who it is. Oh. [gentle music] [knife clanking] [ominous music] [Kelly grunting and panting] [eerie music] Kelly? [Kelly panting] Oh, we didn't know you'd be here. Sorry, you scared me. Just had to pick up some paperwork for the sales from the show. How are you feeling? Anything coming back? Nothing new. It was a deliver for uh, Logan. Thank you. Well, this is perfect. We're all here. We can get back to our weekend dinners again. Again? You've just been so busy with the gallery and all. And I've been busy, too. Are you hungry? I don't really feel like going out. That's all right, we'll order in. We could eat on the roof. Sure. [people chattering] I can't stop thinking about what could have caused the accident. We're pretty sure it wasn't an accident but-- You think so? The police are looking into it. I mean, what if it really was just a misunderstanding or overreaction? No, something happened in the house. We just don't know what. I think we can all assume that you're in danger. Trust me I agree. I just don't know from who. Well, that's where we can help. We know pretty much everyone you know. All right then. Let's think through it. Dan, feel free to chime in with any ideas. Who was that weird artist who kept stopping by? Carl, Carlisle something or other. But no, I haven't seen him around here in months. Other artists track me down? Couple. Yeah, there was definitely one at the show that night. He's an admirer for sure. It was Banks, something Banks. Wait a minute, guys. We gotta be thinking about someone who'd be willing-- To hurt me. He's right. Okay, enemies. I don't know. Logan? Uh [sighs] competing artists maybe. We don't have that kinda bad blood around here. Reed Applegate. He was there that night. Who is he? [tense music] He's a real estate developer. He wants to buy your studio and gallery space to finish his plans for the whole block. Didn't you talk to him at the show that night? No, he did but none of us heard what he said to you. Well, maybe the security systems caught something. All right, gimme one second. Let me find the date. [keyboard clacking] So is anything helping at home? Sort of. It's just so weird to see photos of us together. It's like I'm posing with a stranger. Do you trust him? Yeah, don't you? Of course, you just have to follow your gut. I just don't know if what I'm picturing are actual memories or just something I created in my mind. There is. [people chattering] I don't know. Disrespectful about my offer. There's so much going on, it's hard to hear. All right, hold on a second. Let me see if I can boost the volume. People. Nothing disrespectful about my offer. You'll wish you hadn't done that. Look, can you roll that back? Yeah, yeah. You'll wish you hadn't done that. Hold on, hold on. You'll wish you hadn't done that. You'll wish you hadn't done that. Are you sure you're okay? Yeah, yeah, it's just overwhelming. We should call Detective Vance first thing in the morning. Yeah. [insects chirping] Um... Sleeping arrangements? Right, um-- I can sleep on the couch if it makes you more comfortable. [Kelly sighs] Thanks. [wind whistling] [Kelly sighs] [slow suspenseful music] [dog barking] [Kelly panting] [door clattering] [door creaking] [tense music] [door clattering] [Kelly sighs] You'll wish you hadn't done that. [phone ringing] [people chattering] Applegate's never had any charges against him. And from what I can see here, he didn't technically threaten you. Technically? Well, just 'cause he has no record doesn't mean he's innocent. I know. I'll ask him where he was the night of the crash. It's just, you guys need to be patient. And what, just wait around for something else to happen to my wife? No, I mean, if Applegate has done anything illegal, he's very good at hiding it. I'll let you know what I find. [water tricking] [dog barking] I can't just sit around. I wanna talk to Applegate myself. Do you wanna come with me? [sighs] I think I'll stay here. You sure? [dog barking] I just need some time to decompress. Yeah, I don't wanna leave you by yourself. I'll be fine. Just be careful, okay? [dog barking] Okay. I'll lock up on the way out. You call me if you need me. [slow suspenseful music] [Kelly sighs] [water trickling] [Kelly sighs] [door clattering] [suspenseful music] [intruder breathing heavily] [water trickling] [suspenseful music] [knife clanging] [Kelly grunting] [Kelly gasping and panting] [phone ringing] Alison. Hey, are you okay? Yeah, yeah, just some things are starting to come back. Really? Tell me. Well, nothing certain yet, just art seems to help. Why don't we go out for lunch and get your mind off things? Off isn't the problem. It's getting my mind back. Sorry, bad choice of words. Missed you though. Missed me? Don't we see each other all the time? Yeah, it's just Dan and Logan [phone beeping] are always around. Hey, I'm getting another call. No problem. Call me later. I will, bye. Bye. [phone beeping] [Kelly sighing] [doorbell ringing] [tense music] What are you doing here? I heard about your accident. This is not a good time. It's never convenient when someone wants to talk, say like when a detective calls you up. I'm not offended. I'm not sure I care. You're looking well. Did you get my flowers? Yeah. Good. I wanna follow up about my offer. Your offer. Well, clearly you found it offensive at the gallery. We both know that it's fair though. And I am a firm believer that things happen for a reason. [dog barking] Hey! I was looking for you! You got a lotta nerve showing up here. Dan. Look, you've got a lot on your plate and the last thing either of you need is worrying about the gallery building. It's old. You need something newer. I know what you're up to and you're not getting away with it. Yeah, but the repairs and the-- It's none of your business. It's okay. Maybe now. But you never can tell when something's gonna break down and give you all sorts of problems. Think over my offer some more. I don't care what the detective says, that was a threat. I called Vance. He said Applegate has an alibi. [Dan sighs] I really don't like that guy. I can see why I turned down his offer. Yeah, no kidding. Hey, I talked to Alison. She said before that we hadn't had time to get together for a while. Is that true? Yeah, that's one way to put it. What? About a month ago you guys got into some kind of an argument. You didn't say what it was about and I didn't push it, but it's been a little awkward ever since. Why wouldn't she tell me? Maybe she doesn't want you to worry about that now with everything else going on. [phone ringing] Hello? Yes, this is she. Who is it? Okay. This isn't a good time, I'm... Fine, tomorrow morning then. [phone beeping] What was that? That was a building inspector. He said he got an anonymous call about the safety of the gallery. He's coming tomorrow morning to inspect it. An anonymous call. [tense music] Applegate doesn't waste any time. [Kelly sighs] [insects chirping] [phone buzzing] [phone beeping] Kelly, Carl Martinez here. I've had my report ready on the investigation but you haven't come by yet. Just wanted to remind you. I definitely have answers. Gimme a call. [keyboard clacking] [phone ringing] Detective Vance. Hi, this is Kelly Moore. I'm sorry to bother you again. I just got a strange call yesterday. Go on. A man named Carl Martinez left me a voicemail. He said he had a report for me, an investigation. Carl Martinez you said? Yes. Oh, he's a private investigator. Pretty good one actually. Usually hired by suspicious spouses and lawyers in divorce cases among other things. So it seems like I've hired him for something then. Well, did you call him back? [stammers] No. Not yet. All right, well let me know what you find out and I'll follow up with him after that. Okay. Thanks. Did you see my keys? Oh. This inspection is such a waste of time. You ready? Would you mind taking care of it? You okay? Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. I just need some rest. Okay. Hopefully this doesn't take long. Thanks. [phone ringing] You reached Martinez Investigations. Leave a message and I'll return your call. [voicemail beeping] This is Kelly Moore. I'm on my way to you. [tense music] Something has happened and short way to put it is I think I'm in danger and I need to know what you found out. I'll see you soon. [suspenseful music] [people chattering] eople chattering] [elevator bell ringing] Yes, I understand. And when was that? [light knocking] I'm just wrapping up now. I can give you a few minutes if you want. Gimme 10 to 15. There's a coffee shop across the street. Sure. Yeah, we can definitely check that out for you. I think I can get the information you need. So who complained and what about? I'm not at liberty to say. So it's not as anonymous as you claimed. Let's start in your mechanical room. It's through here. [people chattering] "Martinez was able to prove "my husband was cheating on me." [Kelly sighs] [phone ringing] Dan. No, it's bogus. He's making a huge deal out of routine maintenance stuff, the ventilation, furnace, water heater. There's nothing wrong with any of it, but he's drafting up a huge list. Are we in trouble? He says we have 30 days to fix it. Is it really Applegate? Oh yeah, I'm sure of it. [horn honking] Hey, where are you? I, uh, I just wanted to check something out. By yourself? I can take care of myself. That's not what I meant. Let me know if there's anything else about the building. I gotta go. Kelly. It won't be long. I'll see you at home. [phone beeping] [Dan sighs] [elevator bell ringing] [Kelly sighs] [tense music] [files and papers rustling] [Kelly gasping] [ominous music] [dramatic music] [Kelly panting] [ominous music] [Kelly panting] [gentle music] [people chattering] [phone beeping] [phone ringing] [girls giggling] 911, what's your emergency? No. I'll take it from here. Hey, how you holding up? Can I get you anything? Did you find who did it? Was he still inside? No, no, unfortunately not. But there's a lotta blood so maybe we can find some evidence that links to the killer. [Kelly sighs] You don't by chance know why you hired Mr. Martinez, do you? No. Maybe I thought my husband was having an affair? Okay. Well, unfortunately the computer's been destroyed so our technicians are gonna have to see if there's anything salvageable on that hard drive. This has to be connected, right? Well, I mean, it's possible that you came when someone with a grudge was targeting Martinez, too. But I don't believe in coincidences. How's your memory? Coming back? Nothing I can make sense of yet. [Kelly sighs] Okay. Well, you take care of yourself, all right? I'll let you know what I find out. Thanks. [phone beeps] Alison, can you pick me up? I keep seeing the blood. I just, I can't believe someone killed him. Yeah, I'm just glad you're not hurt. Logan, are you home? Yeah. Why are you home early? [tense music] I um-- Are you okay? Yeah, no, I'm fine, I'm fine. I just, I cut my hand making dinner and I couldn't find the first aid kit. [dramatic music] That looks deep. Fantastic. Well, at least I'll get a cool scar out of it, right? And then every time you see it you'll remember I sacrificed my hand for you. And I think you're gonna need stitches. I said I'm fine, Alison. Sorry, I'm sorry. I'm good. Hey, really, I'm good. I'll grab the kit. Maybe a butterfly bandage will be enough. [Logan sighing] Oh, you should keep that covered. Yeah. Yeah, you're right, I know. I just am so clumsy, you know. Everything okay? Yeah, I just needed to talk to Alison. You can talk to me, too, you know. Logan, I'm sorry-- Don't remember me. Yeah, no, I uh, [laughing] I know. But I'm here for you. Any time. [footsteps clacking] Got it. [Kelly sighs] Do they have any leads? [slow suspenseful music] Not yet. But the detective said they're still looking at everything. What does Dan think of all of this? I haven't called him yet. [timer beeping] Logan. Yeah, that's the oven. I got it. Why haven't you told Dan? It just happened. I think, I think Dan is having an affair. And I think I found out and that's why I hired a private detective. Aw, Kelly. I've been wanting to tell you but I didn't know how. What? I was downtown shopping at, well, it doesn't matter, but it happened to be near where Dan works. I don't know who she is, but... [Kelly sighs] [gentle music] When was this? A month ago. Did you tell me about it? No, no, I didn't. I'm sorry, I didn't know how. Can you text me these? Yeah. [keypad clicking] Can I ask you something? Anything. Dan said that you and I got into an argument about something a while ago. Oh. Is that why you didn't tell me about the photos? What was it about? [tense music] I was being stupid. I got jealous of your success. I mean, you get a lot of attention Well, Logan talks about how well you're doing and I just let it get to me in the wrong way. Didn't I understand that? I said, uh, I said you were using everything to turn attention onto you. Even your parents' death freshman year. The look on your face when those words left my mouth. I, I was... It was cruel and insensitive and I'm... After the accident I was hoping we could just forget it ever happened. Then let's forget it happened. Okay? Really? Yeah. Thank you. Someone chased you? I know. And you went there alone. I didn't know what to expect. "Didn't know what to expect"? You went there to see a PI. Now the man's dead, Kelly! I was there, I know. Thank you. Why? Why would you take that risk? After everything that's happened. Why not just tell me what's going on? What were you hoping to find anyway? Answers, okay? Why did you hire him? Is there something you are not telling me? [tense music] What does that mean? I don't know, I just, I just, I just can't sit here and just wait for the answers. I know, I know that-- [gentle music] No, you don't! I have to do something just to get some control or some clarity. Kelly, you do not have to do this alone. I'm here. And I love you and I just want you to be safe. [Kelly crying] Please, just tell me how I can help you. However you want me to, okay? [Dan sighs] You okay in here? Yeah. I thought I could start in on the maintenance stuff. Okay. [light switch clicking] [somber music] [ominous music] [tense music] What's next? [gas hissing] [Kelly sighing] [dramatic music] I think we can have the inspector come... Kelly? Kelly? [ominous music] No, no, no. No, no, no. Honey, come on. [phone beeping] [phone ringing] Come on. Kelly, honey, please. 911. What's your emergency? Yes, I need an ambulance right now! [tense music] Okay, so the carbon monoxide levels inside the studio [EMTs chattering] are extremely high. What? How? We're looking into everything. Has your furnace been working all right? I was just looking at it. Could that have been it? It's hard to say. You don't have a carbon monoxide detector inside the studio so-- Well, I think there's one in the main gallery. Yeah, you need one in every room. We called the gas company as well and they're gonna come do a test. Hey, Porter. Come take a look at this. Excuse me. Hey, you all right? [ominous music] Any reason this is out here? It's not ours. We should call in a detective. Ask for Detective Vance. Let me know if you find anything. All right, we're about set. You need anything from us? No, I think we got it all for now. How's the woman? She should be released by morning. We found the carbon monoxide tank outside your window. There's a serial number. Do we know who bought it? Yeah, we tracked it back to the manufacturing company, but it was stolen two days ago. So if not for the canister, this woulda been passed off [somber music] as an accident. This has to be Reed Applegate. [phones ringing] He sent the city inspector on us trying to wear us down about the condition of the building so that we would sell it. The inspector claimed there was something wrong with the furnace, but maybe Applegate had him set something up to make it look like it was an accident. Okay. Well, I will call Applegate and the inspector today. Should be arresting 'em. Not without proof. Proof. How much more do you need? There's so much more we need to consider. Is Applegate pressuring you now, too, is that it? Dan. Mr. Moore, I need to speak with Kelly alone please. It's okay. [suspenseful music] I need to ask you some more about Martinez's murder. We found these under some furniture in his office and we think they're from your file. This is all we have that's linked to you. So someone took everything else. [Kelly sighs] Is there a connection to Reed Applegate? Not in Martinez's file. But that could be a part that's missing. What if he's not part of this? Is that what you think? I kinda hope he is, but until I remember, I just have a lot of questions. Is there anything specific that you suspect? My friend, Alison, saw this awhile ago. I don't know who the woman is, but... Okay. Well, Martinez investigated a lot of affairs. Do you think that's what took you to him? Maybe. And yet Dan has been so supportive and nice. And he's also in the photo that Martinez took, right? [Detective Vance sighs] I mean, it's a little thin. Are you sure he was out of town when I had the accident? Well, he absolutely bought the tickets, but I can push to see if he was on the flight. Thanks. But what about that woman? Can you find out who she is? I can do a search, but I can't promise we're gonna find anything. Anything else? Any way I can get a copy of the 911 recording? I don't know, maybe it'll shake something loose in my brain. Yeah, I can send it over. Can you slow down? You know this isn't easy for me either, right? Why? It's bad enough my own wife can't remember me, but you keeping me away, is there a reason for that? What do you mean? You don't trust me. First you do this whole investigation thing without me, you go there by yourself. And now you're having private conversations with the detective. I don't have to run everything by you. Normally, I would agree, but this is a little bit different. Well, it's my life. Oh, here we go. What? Nothing. I just, I don't understand why you keep pushing me away when all I am trying to do is protect you. I don't know you, okay? [somber music] [Kelly sighing] Have I done anything to make you doubt me? [Dan scoffs] Great. [Kelly sighs] [Dan scoffs] I'm going for a swim. [people chattering] [siren blaring] I thought I answered all your questions. I have plans tonight. Well, they'll have to wait. Have a seat, Mr. Applegate. [water trickling] [insects chirping] [Dan sighs] [Kelly sighs] [somber music] [Kelly sighing] [phone buzzing] [Kelly sighing] [keypad clicking] [Dan panting] [Dan panting] [keypad clicking] [ominous music] [stick thudding] [alarm beeping] [crickets chirping] [Kelly gasping] Dan! [monitor beeping] [people chattering] [Dan breathing heavily] Uh, Dan. Are you okay? Do I know you? [both laughing] Okay, that was cruel. I'm sorry, I couldn't resist. [both laughing] Oh. I'm so glad you're okay. [people chattering] Yeah. We're quite the pair. [both laughing] [Dan sighing] Ah. Detective Vance found partial shoe prints leading away from the pool. [sighs] I shouldn't have doubted you. Why did you doubt me? I mean, it couldn't have just been your memory. Well, I... Martinez investigated a lot of affairs and I just assumed that's why I hired him. Are these his photos? No, it's Alison's. She saw you. [Dan sighs] Well, that's my cousin. Rachel. [gentle music] Uh, your cousin? Yeah, you did say you have a cousin that I know that lives downtown. Yep. [sighs] I'm so sorry. It's okay. Hey. We're gonna be all right. You were attacked. And I'm partially responsible. No, you're not. If we wouldn't have argued, you wouldn't have gone out there-- You can't think that way. Look, I wish I hadn't have left that night to go to Chicago after the gallery. I mean, I coulda postponed my trip. I went anyway. As perfect as we try to paint our relationship to be, it's not. I've struggled with you and your career. I mean, it's not that I'm not so proud of you. But I've... I guess I just felt left out. And whenever I brought it up, we would just say things that make it worse. We did? I just wanted us to spend more time together. Lately it's felt like we're living two separate lives. And I made things worse because I would use my own work as an excuse to be apart. I know you've been fighting about it all week leading up to the gallery exhibit. So I went that night to be supportive. If I'd really been, I wouldn't have left. And none of this woulda happened. You don't know that. Maybe not but I would sleep better knowing that I had been there for you completely. I shoulda been better. I'm sorry. [Kelly sighs] Then you're sure there's no affair. Yeah, it was his cousin. Plus Detective Vance called this morning about his flights. Dan was definitely traveling when I was at home. I don't know how you're getting through all of this. And now Dan. I know, I just wish I could remember something that would be helpful or at least know why. [Kelly sighs] Just have to remember. [sighs] Can I get you anything? I think I just need to lie down. Let's get you upstairs. [Dan sighing] [gentle music] I'll be downstairs, okay? Okay. Thank you. [Kelly sighs] [phone buzzing] 911, what is your emergency? Please! Please help I'm being-- [horn honking] [Kelly gasping] [tires screeching] [metal and glass clattering] [Kelly gasping] [Kelly panting] Someone was following me. Please, please help, I'm being-- [tires screeching] [glass and metal clattering] I heard the crash. Is everyone all right? Tell me your location. [ominous music] [tires rustling] Do you know where you are? Honey, call an ambulance. Can you tell me your location? [dramatic music] They were right there. [somber music] What's all this? I've been trying to figure this out. I could use your help. Yeah. What have you got so far? I've been thinking about why I went to Martinez. My supposed affair. That doesn't explain these. The police found them in Martinez's office. Obviously I was suspicious about something. Look at the bank statement. Is this the gallery account? Yeah. Does Logan have access to it? Yeah. And look who's in this photo. [sighs] Okay, hang on. Look, Logan gets on my nerves but his entire livelihood depends on you. Why would he attack you? He had this cut on his hand right after Martinez was killed. [Dan sighs] Are you gonna say it's a coincidence? No, I don't know. You know, I do recognize most of these withdrawals. I mean, you talk about the people you do business with, but some I don't recognize. And this one's $10,000. Is that normal for me? It would help to see some other bank statements so we can figure out what this payment's for. Are you okay? Let me get you something. Thanks. [ominous music] You know, I wonder if some of these-- This was in the kitchen vent. [tense music] Is that what I think it is? Someone's been watching us. I'm at the city's annual celebration so I'm not far from the gallery. Let me see if I can get there before the fireworks start. That would be great. Okay, thank you, Detective. He's gonna meet us at the gallery shortly. Why would anyone wanna watch us? [somber music] I'm more concerned about who. It has to be someone who had access to our house. Unless they broke in without us knowing. Once we get to the gallery, the bank statements will give us more to go on. And you really think Logan coulda done this. The gallery has security cameras. Logan set them up, right? Yeah, he did. [quiet suspenseful music] [door creaking] [sighs] It's gotta be in the office. All right, where would they be? I'll check over here. Have you ever noticed Logan being violent? Not really. You're with him more than I am. But you don't like him. Can you blame me? Well, I've seen how you tolerate him. He's your best friend's husband and your manager. But I've never liked the way he looked at you. Whenever I said anything, you just brushed me aside so... [door rumbling and thudding] [ominous music] What was that? Sounded like it came from the studio. Hello? Who's in here? [door rattling] I'll check it out. [suspenseful music] Stay here. [door clattering and creaking] Is anyone out here? [footsteps clacking] [board thudding] [man grunting] [suspenseful music] Dan? Dan. [door creaking] [tense music] Whoa, oh, hey. Shh, it's just me. It's just me, we're fine, we're safe. Where's Dan? I took care of him. What do you mean? Oh, come on, Kelly, he's always getting in the way. What? Where's Alison? What does that matter? Huh? I'm here. Right, and you're here. It's exactly as it should be. [Kelly grunting] Aye, Kelly, no! Now, we belong together. [light clacking] Kelly, we belong together, okay? Now, Dan is out of town for a few days and we have the house all to ourselves. This is not going to happen, Logan. [light thudding] You were there. You were there that night. See, now that I didn't want you to remember. [Logan chuckles] And why is that? Because you weren't ready to hear what I had to say. [light clattering] [doorbell ringing] [somber music] What are you doing here? Kelly. I had to see you to explain something. But, can it wait? It's been a really long night. No, actually it can't, Kelly. I um... It's late. And Dan is out of town. I don't understand. I mean, you and I, we're alone together all the time at the gallery. You know what I mean. You should really get going. All right, just, hold on, just... Kelly. [chuckles] I love you. [groans] What? You don't love me. Yes I do. Yes I do, more than Dan does. I mean, once you leave him, you and I we'll be together. Whoa. [light clattering] You wanted me to leave Dan. Oh, Kelly, I know that I mean more to you than just a business manager. [tense music] [light clanging] I believe my business manager is stealing from me. I can help you with that. [light clacking] It was you. What? You killed Martinez. I didn't mean to, all right? You stabbed him. It was an accident, Kelly! I... He wouldn't back down, okay? He wouldn't give me what he found. I didn't mean to kill anyone so don't, don't-- And you were stealing from me. All right. See, now that I knew you wouldn't understand. That wasn't for me, come on now. That was for us. That was for us so that we could start our lives together. [Kelly sighs] Now, I know that this is a lot to take in, okay, I get that. But I need you to work with me here, okay? You forgot it all once already, right? Little bump on the head. You didn't even remember Dan. Oh, it was perfect. It was so perfect. And you could realize that you didn't even love him, you didn't love Dan, not really. Dan! Hey, hey, hey, hey. No, no, no, no, none of that. None of that. Now, I know you're confused, but you gotta let him go. Get your hands off! Hey, hey! Stop, stop! That enough! [Kelly grunting] Kelly, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh. That's it. [Kelly panting] Now, I want you to listen to me very carefully, okay? I am not gonna let him or anyone else come between us, okay? All right? And I know, I know you love me. Okay, hey, come on now. How could you? How could you think I could love you after you pushed me out that window? What are you talking about? [Kelly grunts] [Logan grunts] [Kelly panting] What are you talking about? [Logan grunting] [dramatic music] [tense music] [Kelly gasps] [ominous music] [omino] Alison. You took everything away from me. It was you. You tried to kill me. I would never do that [somber music] to Alison, to Dan, to myself. Alison has nothing to do with this, okay? Logan, you need to leave. Get out! Kelly. Get out! [Logan sighs] [Kelly panting] [ominous music] Alison. What are you doing here? Following my husband. [crying] How could you do this to us? No, no, no, no. It's not like that. I don't want anything to do with him. I just told him to leave. You made him fall in love with you. It's not, it's not... Alison, this isn't you. Just breathe. We can get through this. No, we can't. [dramatic music] Kelly! [Kelly panting] [Alison grunting] [door thudding] Alison, Alison. [tense music] Please. Please don't do this, please. [Alison crying] Please just put the knife down. We can get through this together. Together? So I can be compared to you for the rest of my life? Do you understand what it feels like to know that your husband is in love with your best friend? Alison, I never wanted his attention. It's the truth, you know it. [panting] I'm so sorry. [Alison crying] Thank you, thank you. I knew he loved you even when we were dating. Everyone knew. That's on Logan, not you, not me. Alison, please. You're like my sister. Do you really think I would betray you like that? I don't think you can help it. [dramatic music] [glass shattering] [Alison panting] [tense music] [Kelly panting] [Kelly grunting] [panting] Help, help, help, help. [Alison panting] [dramatic music] [car lock beeping] [tires screeching] [Kelly panting] [horn honking] [Kelly gasping] [tires screeching] [Alison panting] [Kelly panting] [phone ringing] [horn honking] [tires screeching] 911, what's your emergency? Please. Please help, I'm being-- [horn honking] [gasping] Oh! [metal and glass clattering] You remember what you did. [dramatic music] [fireworks popping] [both grunting] [fire extinguisher clanking] [both grunting] How could you do this, Alison? Logan wouldn't let you go. [tense music] [explosions booming] [Alison grunting] I saw the way he talked to you and the way he touched you and the way he would watch you on those cameras. [explosions booming] What about the carbon monoxide? Was that you? [Alison panting] Uh huh. And Dan? [fireworks crackling] [explosions booming] [fireworks whistling] I wanted you to know what it felt like to lose somebody you love. If you hated me so much, why didn't just say something? He only married me to get close to you. [fireworks crackling] You know how many times I had to hear about you? "Kelly, Kelly's paintings are amazing. "Kelly's so talented. "Kelly, Kelly is just so great." You were always the center of attention. Now look at. [women grunting] [dramatic music] [explosions thudding] [both women panting] [panting] You took everything from me. [panting] I have nothing left to lose. [both grunting] [women screaming] [fireworks thudding] [fireworks crackling] [tense music] [Kelly panting] [Kelly grunting] Help! [tense music] [Kelly grunting] Kelly! [both grunting] Here, I gotcha. Come on, come on. Come on, I gotcha. I gotcha. [both panting] [explosions booming] [gentle music] Oh. Thank you. All right, you two. I'm gonna need you to come in and give statements. But we'll do that tomorrow. [sighs] Thank you, Detective. You bet. [Kelly sighs] I had figured out Logan was up to something with the accounts. Why didn't you tell me and before you hired Martinez? I think because I knew you didn't like him and I didn't wanna cause any problems if I was wrong. [sighs] But Alison. She hated me so much. I just wish I would've known or seen some signs. Maybe I could have [sighs] done something to help her. This isn't your fault. None of it is. [Kelly sighs] I'm so sorry it took me so long to put my memories back together. I know it's been horrible for you. Not as much as for you. I love you. You know that? I know. [siren blaring]
