JACKEE: Just tell Juice I don't owe her no more favors. - Jackee, you bastard. - WOMAN: Well, well. Aren't we in a predicament? - Back off! - [SNICKERING] It's all right. Nice place you got here. Juice said you quit working for her so you could design these rags. Maybe I did. So what? I don't know why the fuck she wants you. [SIGHS] But Juice needs a bodyguard. Yeah, well I don't guard bodies anymore. Yeah, that's what I told her. I said "Juice, she don't guard bodies no more. Especially at the lousy wages you pay." You'll never guess what she said. - [BED CREAKS] - [LAUGHS] "Convince her," she said. "But first... see if she's still got what it takes." - [SIGHS] - Mmm.

Yeah, well I ain't exactly had the good life. You should have taken my advice and not quit. Retired. And somehow that pension you promised me never came through. You won't need a pension after this job. I'll get you a ticket outta here and set you up in some nice little place of your own. Yeah, well this time I'm doing it for me. You understand, Juice? This is the last time. You get me out of this hell hole. You owe me that. Relax. Relax. You've done it 100 times before. Oh, you two make me sick.

I told you 100 times never piss me off when I'm plugged in. ♪ On a corner ♪ ♪ Not waiting for much ♪ ♪ I was minding My own business ♪ ♪ When I felt Some stranger's touch ♪ JUICE: This is going to be a straight exchange. I got the goods in my sock if they got the green. We make the deal, leave. And you get paid enough to get you out of Los Angeles, and set you up in some cozy chateau. - What kind of goods? - Just keep your eyes open and keep me alive. I got the jitters about this one. You part of the deal, sweet meat? If you want my advice, I'd let her go. Still the same old Juice. Giving advice. JUICE: Lori, Plughead. We go way back. He used to be my psychotherapist before he became a legitimate crook. [FINGERS SNAP] [BEEPING, MODEM SQUAWKS] [INHALES DEEPLY] Ahh. - Silicone? - Don't insult me. Sample it. [CHIP CLICKS] [BREATHES SHARPLY] [CHIP CLICKS] [BREATHING HEAVILY] - This shit is pure. - Of course. What did you expect? They're seed chips. Seed chips? Each one can produce 1,000 more. They'll bring you a fortune in New York. Shit, we'd be able to buy New York. You get your vehicle from a guy named Jugs. He's a retired Maze rat. When you get to New York, the drop-off is in the old recycling center. - They're expecting you on the 16th. - MAN: Out of my way. You never give up, do you, Romeo? It's all right. Thank you. I am a desperate man. Tell me where she is, or I shall be forced to take my own life. [CROWD CHUCKLES] I'm sorry, pal. You're making a scene. Yoyo, make sure Romeo finds the door. There's no need for violence. I can find my own way out, thank you. You haven't seen the last of Danner Romerick. He's, uh, full bio-synthetic, isn't he? Mmm. One of the last. He drove a shipment for me once. Best driver we ever had. And, uh, - what's his button? - This is good. I programmed him to think he was in love with some broad. He ran the chips in exchange for her whereabouts. - What'd you do, ice her? - What the fuck is this? 20 Questions? Now, this is really great. She don't exist. She's a program in his mind. He delivered the chips for nothing. He's an odd one, though. Real quirky. I never had the heart to tell him he was chasing a program. Juice... you is such a good, good woman. JUICE: Yeah. And I got the chips. So let's deal. Ah. LORI: It's a set up! Let's go, they're badges. Nobody moves. Nobody dies. Nobody dies. Now you buttwipes just won me a promotion. So drop the heaters and kiss the carpet. - [GUNFIRE] - [SCREAMING] Everybody moved. JUICE: Thanks. I owe you. Just get me my ticket out of here. I won't forget it. [GRUNTS] [ELECTRIC ZAPPING] [PANTING] Don't do this, Plughead. Do what? Take it. Take it. Thank you. [PANTING] Hey! Watch your back, 'cause I sure as hell will. Juice... I was your analyst for what? Five years? In that time, I... I grew to love your mind, it... It had a complexity that I became addicted to. I hated you for that! [NECK SNAPS] - [BODY THUDS] - [PANTING] For such a big woman, you break so very easily. - Next! - [GASPS] Relax, sweet meat. This will be a snap. [GROANING] [GASPING, GRUNTING] [PLUGHEAD CONTINUES GASPING] The muscle bitch... she killed your boss. [RASPY BREATHING] And she took the chips. What now... boss? [SEAGULLS CRY] [WAVES CRASHING] - LORI: Danner. - Yes. Hey, Romeo. Nice hologram. I'm sorry, but I'm not entertaining guests tonight. If you don't mind I'd prefer to be alone. I don't want your Romeo services. - I never had to pay for it. - Oh, it's you. Yeah, and I got a proposition for you, - but I don't have much time. - You may propose. Oh. - I told you I'm not for hire. - [SCOFFS] I need to get to New York. You know how to run the Maze. One second. - Get me the police. - [SCOFFS] I have never struck a woman, but if you don't leave, I might be tempted. Look, why don't you take a sub-train? I'd never get past customs, and there's no way I'm going Topside. Well, I'm sorry. You'll just have to find yourself another driver. I know where she is. I know where your girlfriend is. Where is she? Tell me or I'll slit my own throat. Jesus, come on. Put it down. Come on, put it down. Come on, put it down. - Put it down. - Tell me. I'll tell you where she is. Put it down. I'll tell you where she is. Come on. Come on. Jesus Christ. What, are you programmed for suicide or what? I'll tell you where she is after you drive me to New York. Your boss made the same proposition and betrayed me. - Ex-boss. - Why should I trust you? Hey, take it or leave it. MAN [coughs]: All right, who are you and what are you selling? Hey, what is this? A pleasure droid? Oh, no. Oh, yeah! Oh, boy, if Roma could see this. Yeah. I ain't seen any of you guys in a long time. OK, come on in, pal. The door is open. [MECHANICAL WHIRRING, AIR HISSING] Yo, I'm Jugs. Remember me? I used to work for Juice. I remember. What happened to you? Oh, this? I was hoping you wouldn't notice. What do you need, kid? I need something to get us through the Maze. Well, ain't much to run in all those old parking garages, if your driver knows what he's doing. DANNER: My God. A 1964 Ford Galaxy 500 XL. 425 horsepower. Four-speed console shifter with cruise-omatic transmission. She'll do better than a 120 miles an hour. Ain't she a beautiful lady? And she's the last of the line, I think. What do you want for her? Come on, Danner. You can't even plug into it. I don't interface like some mechanical half-breed. No offense. I'll take her. LORI: What do you mean you don't plug? How are we supposed to get through? - I shall drive. - Without plugging? - [MACHINE BEEPING] - And without credit. This card is maxed out, pal. Great. JUGS: You know something? As much as I love her, I got no use for her no more. Now there's a full tank of water and this hydro-converter will get you 800 miles to the gallon. You see, I got a taste for fine machines. They should never have stopped making guys like you. You guys are the closest things to the real thing. According to my ex-wife. Hey, sugar pants, do me a favor. Tell Juice not to make herself such a stranger, huh? - I'll do that. - Shall we? Where are we? We are in the Maze. Somewhere under old Sunset. This particular garage stretches all the way from Los Angeles to Denver. We'll take the sewers from there to New York. How can you even tell where we are? - What, you distrust me already? - Just drive. You know, you really should learn to curb that temper. Yeah, I'll do that. You know, when I was a kid I used to dream about you Romeos. Champagne, walks on the beach. White horses trotting by. The works. All the romance money can buy. Say, what's your going rate now, anyway? Hmm? Oh, what? Not for sale? Already got your sights set on some woman you'll never find? What makes you think I won't find her? I mean, when you do find her, what, you're just gonna go off and get married, live happily ever after like that? Yeah. - Something like that. - Yeah, well, it ain't that simple, babe. It ain't just a program. Hey, slow down. You wanted a driver, I'm driving. Slow down, goddamn it! Listen, Danner. You wanna die every time you think about your lost love, that's your business. But if you ask me, that kind of stuff belongs on romance disks. Just get me to New York, will ya?

Who, who told you that? What? Where did they go? I don't know what you're talkin'... What's this? That, that's, uh, scrap. Hey, I don't know what you're talkin' about, pal.

I never go anywhere without my... - ...six-to-one. - Look. You know, Jugs, the human mind is such a wonderful thing. When information is inputted, it's never lost. You've just gotta know the right... - ...place... - [JUGS MOANS] - ...to look for it! - [GASPS] [LORI GROANS] What is that smell? It's like rotten eggs. DANNER: We must be nearing a Topside outlet. Wait a minute. [TURNS OFF ENGINE] - Terrific. Now what? - [SNIFFING] Well? Something's wrong here. Yeah, you took us the wrong way, that's what's wrong. No, I took us the right way. I just didn't expect this. - Expect what? - It's the end of the line. - The route is blocked. - What? - We'll have to go back. - Go back? What do you mean, go back? I can't go back. What, to cops, chip dealers? There's nothing back there for me, Romeo. No. I'm getting to New York, with or without you. Just tell me where she is. Tell me where she is and I'll stand by you all the way to New York. I've been years searching for her, and I'm no closer than when I started. [SQUEALING] [GASPS] Sewer leeches!

Oh, my God! - MAN: Don't touch him! - [LEECHES SQUEALING] There's nothing you can do for him now. He's full of toxins. Peekaboo. Oh, it looks like you gave him some pretty nasty love bites, huh? [GROANS] There you go. So what's in the case? Nothing that concerns you. Everything concerns me down here, sweetheart. I'm a very concerned person. - Hey, what are you doing? - Hmm. Foraging. Your lucky your boyfriend's a synthetic, or I would've had a hard time saving him. Thanks. You look like you had a rough day. How 'bout a little R&R? - So you got a vehicle? - So what? So I wanna ride outta here. No room for passengers. - Where you headed? - None of your business. - What are you smuggling? - Don't push it. Oh, wha...? You and your boyfriend were cruising around looking for Lover's Lane? What? Do I look like I was born in this hole? Top dollar means Topside. And if we're gonna make a move, we're gonna need these babies. You know, what is this "we" crap? What makes you think I'm going Topside. Nobody goes Topside. There's only one market in this sewer, sweetheart, and that's New York. You could forget about running the Maze. The only way out is Topside. And I got the oxy. Unless you wanna go home. [CACKLING] What's up there for you? Ooh, you see this little guy? If I pluck him off the wall and eat him without cooking him first, I'd be puking my guts out for days. In fact, this bugger, he might even kill me. But, if I put him in a pot, bring him to a slow boil and simmer him for about an hour, hour and a half, I could live off him for a long time. You follow my meaning? Not exactly. Let me put it this way. I'm sick of eatin' leeches. Medic, is he alive? Yeah. Yeah, but, uh, his mind's been blown completely to hell. It's like somebody stuck an eggbeater in his skull and switched it on to high. Any chance of getting some answers? Uh, yeah, yeah, with a vacuum, maybe. No, no, man. I, I don't think so. There's not much left to vacuum. Just do it. [BEEPS] [BEEPING] [SUCTIONING] - Hey, Beany. - What? Isn't this, isn't this your sister, Jodie? I'll be damned. March. Thanks for the coat.

Now, come on, you guys. Topside ain't that bad. All you gotta do is keep your eyes on the oxy gauges and don't get too excited. You get too excited, you lose all your oxygen.

Probably the oxy-fluro-chlorozine. Get used to it. We don't have to worry about this one. He's leech bait. Eww. Now what? - Through the wall. - What? Through the wall? That's crazy! Sometimes you have to trust people. Trust! Goddamn shit! Goddamn piss! Yee-haw! [HACKING] Nothing like the great outdoors. It was a wallogram. - Give me a hand. - Sure. Eww. PLUGHEAD: What do you think about all this? Take a look out there. I mean, pollution's so thick, you can't even breathe it. - It's all right. - It's all right? It's all right? God. It's an ecological disaster. A crying shame. It's not my problem. And where are your morals? God.

Hey, I can pick the lock on that thing. - Yeah. No time! - Oh, my God, no! No. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Anybody got a knife? Oh, my God! No! [SOBBING] [GASPING] Oh, my God! Oh, my God. You. You know, Juice, for such a little woman, you sure are hard to kill. [GULPS, GASPING] Sweet meat. How good to see you again. You don't know how I've longed for this meeting. [GRUNTS] Fatch. The chips. Hey, boss. Where you goin'? [POUNDING ON DOOR] [MAN SHOUTING] Half of you, split. Move it out on the left. - OK. - [COCKS GUN] Nobody moves, nobody dies. - [GUN COCKS] - DANNER: Nobody cares. [GUNFIRE] [GRUNTS] You've got the chips. Just take 'em. You don't understand, do you? It's not the chips that I want. It's always been you. As I always say: "Why jack off when you can jack in?" [GUN COCKS] [GRUNTS] DANNER: I'd like to thank you for something. And what's that, Circuitry Man? Giving me something to live for. [ELECTRIC ZAPPING] - Surprised, Romeo? - A trifle, Circuitry Man. [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOT] [SCREAMING] You pathetic, little machine! [VOICE ECHOING] Welcome. To my mind. Look at me! [SCREAMING] You're a machine. [SCREAMING] - Say it! - [BREATHING HEAVILY] - You're insane! - Think so? Look at yourself, Romeo. You're just a machine. I am you, you are me. No, I'm different. Ah, suicide? Do it, Romeo. Do it. You're just like me. Yeah, maybe a little. [SCREAMING] [POWERING DOWN] [GASPS] [VEHICLE APPROACHING] [REVS ENGINE] [TIRES SQUEAL] [GUNSHOTS] [GUN CLICKING] [LAUGHS] How the hell did you get the chips? Where to... boss? I know a great little salad bar in Jersey. I was hoping for something a little more romantic.
