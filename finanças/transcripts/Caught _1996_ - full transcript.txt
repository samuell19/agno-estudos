It's amazing how you get into things ... Caught Hey kid! It's wet out there. How'd you like to come inside and warm up? I pay ten bucks. Hey, it's for you. For the first time you're down without change in your pocket- You think you'll starve to death. But you don't starve. It's a matter of time and luck ... Making the right career move Hey man, you need cash? All that's required is you drop off these "Packages" for me. Hey, you're pissing on my boots. Happy Valentine's Day! Subject fleeing north on St. Paul Avenue. Male Caucasian. Sorry. we're closed. Could I have a glass of water, please? Yeah, sure. Are you okay? Nah, I'm just a bit dizzy. I haven't eaten for a few days. Thanks. - What's wrong with your finger? - Nothing. I hit something. - Joe, I think this boy is sick. - No. I'm fine, honestly. Sorry. I didn't mean to bother you. We should drive him to the hospital. No. Honestly, I'm fine. Once I get some food into me I'll be good. There's a homeless shelter 'bout two blocks down. How can we just leave him? He could be knifed and raped. Joe What do you want to do? Take him home with us? So you can see this is more of a family thing. Don't be bashful. Alright, thanks. Do you have a family? Where are you from? From Ireland, originally. I hadda learn to talk this way. Ireland? Yeah, my mom died when I was like- sixteen. Took my father a while to get over it, 'bout a month. Found this chick, got married. She says to me, This. it's still your house, she said, but uh... You gotta learn to have a little bit more respect, gonna have to learn to be nice. " 'Course I didn't have to be nice, and so I left. So we have a son. He doesn't live here any more. He lives in L.A., in Hollywood. Maybe you've seen him. Yeah, he's been on Sesame Street, right?. And uh... ...Star Search, twice. - Oh yeah? What's his name? - Danny Dime. - Mmm, Danny Dime? - That's not his real name. His real name wasn't good enough. Too bad there's no Fish Search, So you could be on TV. I like that. Fish are his life. Fish been very very good to me. - I like fish. - Yeah, he should. He'd work day and night if I let him. And with a weak heart. The doctor warned him. If you don't slow down and get a helper, he could go just like that. We all go like that. My brother Eddie went just like that. But he lived and went places. I'll take you places. You want to go places? Tomorrow morning, 5 o'clock, I'll take you to the Fulton? fish market. Take him. He's just what the doctor ordered. A helper. He's just a kid off the street. So what? He needs some work, right? He's gotta eat, don't he? He's not doin' too bad. Do you believe in work, or do you just like getting your meals for free? - Sure. - Sure what? - I worked. - Doing what? Whatever there is. Driving vans, cleaning carpets... ...building coffins. Coffins? Yeah, for all the homeless that die in the streets. Load 'em in the boat and they take them out and bury'em in Potter's field somewhere. You're probably just like everyone else, think that fish stink. He doesn't? A hundred a week. With tips for deliveries. What, are you crazy? You gotta excuse my wife, she's goin' nuts. You'd like it here. I guarantee it. And the smell, forget about it, you'll get used to it. The smell pays the rent, right? Okay. The smell puts food on this table, right? All right, don't get so excited. Listens. My wife's mouth it is bigger than our bank account. If I offer you eighty bucks, would you take it? Eighty, huh? Because if you stay here, we would find a place. What? Well look, Danny's room is empty Isn't it? You can stay, you can stay here. It's yours, if you take the job, it's yours. It's up to you, Joe. You're the boss. A week. You'll give it a week, until you can't eat any more,and you've got 80 new bucks in your pocket. He grew up in this room. Since Hollywood, we're lucky if he talks to us. Instead of calling, he sends us tapes. Betty, I'm going to bed. I'll be in in a minute. I want to show him Danny. Danny? What does he want to see Danny for? What then, damnit? Oh, he lives here now, doesn't he? He's one of the family. Try to get some rest. Alarm's set for 4:30. Alright. The next Robin Williams, that's what his agent calls him. Come with me. And his agent should know, because- -he was the one who did Rich Little before Little got big. Joe says that I should write his material. We used to have an act, Betty & Danny. Weddings, talent shows, They couldn't get enough. They ate us up. Turn off the light, please. You will love this. I'll show you just one, alright. You can watch the rest when you're bored. He's good, huh? That's when he was a rock star. The Fenwicks. Yeah, they were number 77 on the college radio. And of course, just when things got hot, they went bankrupt. Guess who ... Caught my act, at the comedy center the other day. NBC. And guess who they're talking about having his own sitcom. Well, I'll give you a hint. It starts with a "Danny" and stops on a dime. So better stay-tuned a moment, 'cause it could be your last chance to have me all to yourself. Because soon mom, I'll be ... an American icom. I hope so. You know he got turned off by The Tonight Show. Yeah, I don''t know why, I mean whadda they know. So, do you wear pajamas? Yeah, sometimes. Okay, wear them. Danny won't mind. You walk with me, you walk with the best. Did you see Scarface? I think Danny saw it 32 times. The sheets are clean. And here's a shirt ... and A pair of old boots. I don't want you to die of pneumonia on your first day on the job. I'll try not to disappoint you. Hey kid! It's 4:30. Get up. Hey Joe, is that your son? No man. His name is Nick, I'm breaking him in. I got some beautiful snapper today, come take a look. I'll give you some good prices on some good fish It's okay, okay. How much? How much? Three dollars. Hey, Big John! - How are you doing, Joe? - What's wrong? I have some beautiful hake, beautiful hake. You can't do better than that. You can't do better than that. That's it. You can't do better than that. Give me forty and take all five boxes and take the whiting and that's it. Twenty five. Unlock the truck. Now, the most important thing Is yourself. I want you to grade the ice, always grade the ice, so people walking by, they can see everything. Now, get your fish, line them up, make them look good. And remember, you mix the old ones of yesterday with today's fresh ones, alright? People will know that you know the difference. But people who don't know shouldn't notice, they won't know. They won't know the difference. Take the lofol?tilo. This is a lofol?tilo. Be careful with this one, alright? This one, even though it's dead, it will bite you. What's this one called? This is a Shad. They're just starting to come in. They only come in three months out of the year. There's no other fish like it. A thousand bones, like little tiny needles. If you can bone one of these ... you're a fisherman. Do you think my son's a star? Before I got sick and it came apart, you should have caught my act. In the windows of some of the best seafood houses. The fastest knife in the East they called me. And this is my own little invention, the only one of its kind. I designed this board. Like everything else, it's a gimmick. Gimmick and an art. Beautiful, huh? If you don't catch 'em they escape by the sea. But every year they have to come back to the river where they were born. Alright, touch it. Do you see these nails? Filed and manicured every Saturday, to keep them light. Any customer who finds a bone, I give him his money back plus a quarter. Hey, Santiago, how's your meat? My meat is very sweet, thank you very much. Did you hear? Hear what? Bud Rothman, the jeweler. He just got an offer. Yeah, so? What do you mean "so"? Don't you get it? First the pharmacy and now the Donut Hut. All that's left now is you and me and the luncheonette and the laundry. So what's happening, What's going on? Aw, Santiago is giving himself a hard on. Thinks Donald Trump's gonna come in here and buy us out, turn everything into a condo. Oh, no. It's true! Hey, last year, the cleaners across the street, their 96 year old mother got close to a million ... When a big conglomerate came around & bought in there and built the Royalty Tower. Before that, you couln't give that store away. A million you say? - Yeah. You could buy a yacht and a Rolls Royce. Hey ten bucks says a year from now, Arabs and Japanese live right here. And you, my dear, will be wearing mink panties. Hey Hi. Ah, I was just thinking, I just remembered- Danny's old robe. For around the house. It's nice. Thank you. What'd you do, put the whole bathroom on? I got a little carried away in there. So you worked hard today, did a good job. Thanks. So did you. Thanks. So, selling the store for close to a million- That would be...something, wouldn't it? Something...Close to a million. Who knows? Danny is not the only one who might make it big. You brought us luck. You came along at the right time. I know. - I'm going to go to sleep. Good night!. - Good night. End of the Week, you're still here. I don't want hair in my fish. Rhythm! Rhythm! Look who's here, her royal highness. Good Morning. - Hey, hey! - Hey, hey what? I was listening to that. Right. I hate that. And you're still here, a week after that. In the early 70s, rich kids dropping out, becoming hippies. Me, I was just home from Nam, didn't want to go to college, didn't have a pot to piss in. What was I to do? At 21, had to get a diploma. Three months after I'm home, Betty was pregnant. I couldn't even think of a GI loan. Nah, I had to get a job. I went into the fish business. The things people do with the cards they're dealt. If I had to do it over again ... I'd be out there. In that boat ... Pulling in shad for a thousand dollars a day. No woman telling me what to do, hassling. Let's go Let's go Come on, man .. I'm right behind you. - For the House. - I'm going after you. - I'm right behind you! - Let's go! Let's go! - Hey Nick! Taking over the business? And after a while ... You forget about leaving. I have beautiful fish, beautiful salmon, beautiful sea bass... I want the usual order. Bring me some more ice too, would you? - So? Well, did he make you an offer? - Same as you. I was right then, right? Close to a million? I told him to shove it. What do you mean shove it? What're you talking about? These big shots, think they can come in her and buy and sell you? Fuck them. No fucking Donald Crump is gonna tell me where to go! Nobody can push me out of my place! Somebody's gotta teach 'em a lesson. I wouldn't move out of this place, I don't care if they gave me two million. What are you trying to do to me? Huh? You trying to kill me? Two...! Twice I've been held up here, twice by dopers. No sale, Santiago. You gotta sell! It's the whole block or nothin'. I'd rather die in my boots than at a craps table in Vegas. He's going to give me a coronary here. Nick is wrong. Talk to him, please. Take a card, any card. Put it back. Shuffle. You're just doing this to spite me. Do you know what it would mean to me getting out of the store? Being a person. A woman. For the first time in my life. What have you been up to now? A thing. A smelly fucking thing. That ain't it, that ain't it. That's it. Queen of Diamonds! You.....shit! You know, she's just like our kid. Always has been They think they're something special, the world owes her a living. Fuck her! Excuse me, I'm sorry. Money doesn't make you anything. It's not money at all that makes you anything. It's what you got in here, what you got in here. I mean what you gonna do with the money anyway? Spend it and become a rich widow? Hi. Hi. I didn't expect you back so soon. - Where's Joe? - He went for his manicure. I got the stuff you wanted. Thanks. - So did he say anything? - What about? About the store. I thought if I got off his back for a day or two- - He'd think about it, change his mind. - Joe? Nah. - I don't think so, eh? - You're sure. I betcha you can change it. How could I change it? He likes you. He's a new man since you been here. Look ... I'm just a helper. A hired hand. Remember? No, you're not. You're more than that. He trusts you. He'd listen ... to you. Just talk to him Tell him he's making a big mistake. Spiting himself. Why'd it be worth it? For me You won't be sorry. Hey hey, that's my car, that's my fish. That's right. Let's go now! - Did they get anything? A bag. A bag with shellfish. Just pull over here, man. Stop, man, Stop! Sons of bitches. That ain't the first time that's happened and it ain't gonnna be the last either. Hey joe, you know you don't have to fucking fight these assholes anymore. - You could be out there. - What? You could be out there, like you said, have a boat of your own. - You could be out there all day. - Are you crazy. Don't get me wrong, I'd love it, but I'm too old for that. What do you mean you're too Old? You're like a fucking bullet. Even I can't keep up with you. That's sayin' a lot. That's saying a lot. You think so? All it takes is a little fucking money. Money? It's all it takes. A fucking boat ?. I could have a fucking fleet. You know, I've had this dream. Charter boat service, down in Florida, along the Gulf coast. Isn't that what the doctor ordered? I mean, who needs those goons ... Coming down and trying to kill me with the switchblades? Freezing my balls off. But I'm talking about a class operation. - Wow! - No, really, class. I mean real fishermen. I don't want no fucking bums coming down there guzzling beer & taking a picture with a fucking tuna. You know what I mean? Fuck them. What do you think, good idea? Yeah, fine. - It's a good idea, right? - Yeah, amazing. I could be a star again. I could have been someone. Now I'm gonna be someone! - I like it. - Joe's fishing fleet. - It's excellent, excellent! - You, me and the deep blue sea. - I like it! - Joe's fishing fleet! - Oh yeah! What's the matter, mom? Don't you love me anymore? Long time, no hear! My last routine, wasn't so bad, huh? Hey, you're gonna have to open the store up tomorrow with Nick. I got an appointment. What appointment? With that attorney that made me an offer I couldn't refuse I told him I'd reconsider, fifty-fifty. What did he say? Come on down. The bathroom is yours. Come on down. Hey what's the matter? Can't sleep? Thank you. I knew you could do it. And you did. Hey, it was nothin'. I just talked to him like you asked. Boy, you saved my life. I've been thinking, though. Maybe it's time for me to leave. To leave? You know, once the store's sold- there won't be any need for me anymore. Besides, I like to move around. I don't like stayin' in one place too long. Yeah. I don't blame you. I guess if I was you ... I wouldn't hang around either. Besides, you're just a kid. You can go where you like- -you can trust or please (??) No ... no ... don't ... I'm not just a kid. - What is this? - What do you think, it's rice pudding. What are you trying to do? Are you trying to kill me or what? No. This is good for you Joe Look, it has raisins and vanilla. Just the way you like it. She hasn't made me rice pudding for 20 years! What's gotten into you? Not a lot. I was in the mood. I still like it. - It's good,huh? - Yes, it's good. I just don't want to break the mood. - You remember? - What? - You remembered? - Of course I remembered. This is crazy. And wrong. But then- -all he has to do is go after the bait. Or take a nap. Say my name! Oh Nikki ...! Say it. Fuck with me, fuck with the best. - Say my name... - Betty ... Hey, what's going on in there? Where's my beer? Yeah, I got it, Joe, be out in a second. Yes..! Yes..! Yes ..! What? What happened? What happened? Look at this baby. Heh, not bad. 4 minutes & 15 seconds since the time you took the fish out. Let's see if there's any shad left. Not bad. I'm going to put it in the window with your name on it. Here we go, here we go. Last one on the left. You're going to ruin the surprise, Peter. - Come on. - I'm coming. - You don't need help? - No, I'm there. Are you sure about this, Danny? We should have called first.

Is there something else you forgot to mention? Well, I was just waiting for the papers to be signed. To be sure that it was happening. - Joe. I should send the heads and all, just like this one, right? -Yes. Would somebody mind telling me what's going on here? What fucking papers you're talking about? - Good morning, good morning. How are you? - All right. Pardon? I sold the store for almost a million dollars. You're not the only big shot. I want to buy myself a whole fleet of fishing ships. In Florida, maybe an island.

When you're not boning a shad or watching TV with the folks, you got a life? Yeah, sometimes I read. Yeah, right. A great boy like you? You got to be getting it somewhere. That's some mom, huh? When I was in high school, all my friends had the hots for her. In college, they thought she was my sister. My chica. What about you, you got a mom? She's dead. I'm sorry. Having mine, it must be a real comfort to you. Yeah, she's been really good to me, Dan. - Daddy! - Put that fucking shit out. This ain't my boat. Put it away. Sooner or later, you know that this has got to end. You have to get out of this. Right now. Right now. I wish we could tell him, show him, so he could see how wonderful it is. Tomorrow. You'll go tomorrow. But tomorrow you stay. Take this for Amy. Something to eat. Hey, look at that. - That could be used some day. - Yeah right. You stay because you're in the middle of a story and you have to finish it. You stay 'cause you know you can always just get away at the last minute. I'm coming! - Hello..? - It's Nick. I'm here with the fish. Oh honey, I can't come down myself, so I'll leave the door open, okay? Fine. Check the refrigerator, I have a good plan. Can you put the fish in the refrigerator,because I'm in here with Peter. It's okay. You okay in there? Yes, hi, more or less. - Want some help? - That would be great. Hello..

Hey, he's a fullback, do you want to go for a swim? In the big bath he was making a splash. We'll leave a little bit, and you've got spiked hair now. Look at mommy. See the hair? Hi, handsome. - Cute, eh? - Cute. He's all pink, and so cute I can't take my eyes off of him. Be a good boy Peter! Are you okay? Yes. You're alright, you okay? - Hey. Hey hey. - Oh, Danny. No need to explain. Nick here needed a bath, and as long as you're giving Peter one... We had no, we had no food in the house. And he brought us some... The old fish delivery story, huh? You are fast, aren't you, Buddy. I better get going, really. - You're not leaving on my account, are you? - No. I have to get back to work. Hey, it's been fun. Come again, stay longer next time. Seriously, mi casa es tu casa.(my house is your house). You already got my room--pull up a kid and then the wife. Say "Bye" to Uncle Nicki. Goodbye, Uncle Nicki! What time is it? Almost three. Oh God! It's so hot here. Hey! How you doing, Mama? I put this on for you. Remember "Yan Yu"? Dance with me, Cha - cha - ch?. Did you ask me here to dance the "Cha - cha - ch?"? Okay, Mama, no Cha - cha - cha. I would like a refill, please. I want black coffee, and put some ice in it, please. So? Just like old times. Are you stashing it all away in the vault? So you want it or not? It stinks, but... You can still take it, most places. It smells fine to me. You didn't tell the boss, right? You asked me not to. Listen mom. I'm going to pay you back soon as my deal's closed. I'm just a little, a little short right now, you know. With the moving expenses, and the coca addiction. - Fooled you. - There she is! I knew I could still get a laugh out of you. My baby... So, who'd have believed it, huh? You're finally getting out of the store, out of the neighborhood, Well, I'm not out of there yet. I'll believe it once I have the check. It's going to be paradise. You and Dad, and Nick, on a boat, off an island somewhere. The paradise, Nick, that guy. It was a lucky day for me when he walked in. For you? Yes, I don't have to worry, about dad now. I mean, with Nick around, he doesn't have to work so hard, eh? Overdo it, right? You and the boss can finally take that second honeymoon, live. Okay. I got to go. It's a lucky day for everyone, Mom, even Amy. Amy? That boy shad boner's over at our house every day now. Stopping by, making deliveries, pa pa pa pa pa. I mean I'm never there when he's there, but Amy says she'd be miserable without him. Even little Peter won't take a bath unless Uncle Nicki's there. Little prick. I'm just kidding. You don't think I have anything to be nervous about, do you? Last night, I could've sworn, I smelled fish in my bedroom. - That's not funny. - It's not? Listen to jokes, Mom. You can save your jokes for NBC, Son. I was only kidding. I was only kidding! Okay. Sports fans! Our contestants are neck-in-neck as they enter the home stretch. We have Shad Rac, and Meshad Abendigo, the world's leading boners in a shad fight to the death. Will the old guy still have it, or the kid from nowhere, the young buck, our lucky Leprechaun? Will he take the day? Finally. The moment everyone was waiting for, yes! Which shad's got no bones left? You find a bone in that, I'll give you a quarter. I could use it. Checking, clean as a whistle. And in this corner, the world champ's challenger The winner and still champion ... The fastest boner in the east! So tell us, Danny, now that the papers are signed, the check is in the bank ... How does it feel having such wealthy parents? Well Geraldo, to tell you the truth, it doesn't change a thing. Money doesn't count in our family .. just so long as we've got food on the table and an active sex life. Come on, Danny, what about that yacht and the Mercedes Benz you've always wanted? You think you'll be getting those now? Well Gerrraldo, it's funny you should ask. Because soon, I'm going to be getting my own check, And everything that's coming to me. What's coming to you?

Crazy fuck. What's it going to take to wipe that grin off your face? Come on, rub my back, would you? No one's ever touched me like you touch me. There's a cruise ship leaving for Mexico on Saturday. I going to go to the bank tomorrow and take the money. I'm going to get half the money, baby. What's mine. Tomorrow? Why tomorrow? Huh? What's the rush? Danny. He knows.

Hey, baby Maybe now you won't leave a bone. Joe's Fish, Mrs. Joe speaking. Hi. I'm fine thanks Okay. I'll have him drop it off before lunch. Bye. It was Amy, Nick. She wants some...fillet. Again. Hey. How you doing? What's going on? I need to get out of here. Let's go for a walk, okay? So what's the matter? Nothing. What, what, what...? Wait. Oh Jesus. We got in a fight. Peter was playing with the clown And Danny got upset because... ...because he wouldn't eat his cereal. And he started yelling and saying terrible things about you. What did he say? That you were a thief, and that you were trying to steal Peter and me away from him... ...the way you stole his room and his family. He accused me of having an affair with you, Nick. Oh God. I dont know. I do not know what to do. He's out of control and violent all the time now. I's so afraid for Peter. I'm so worried about Peter. You got to get the fuck out. Who knows what Danny's going to do next? I just don't know where to go, Nick, because I don't have any family or money. I got money. - You're home early. Quick with the deal? - What the hell are you doing here? I'm here every day. My friend. I come when you guys are all at work, and I leave before you all get back. I got something for you. Number one son. Number two... You can put it over there. We'll have Nick's wall, and Danny's wall. Thanks, I'll stick it up later. We could have been brothers. We're more alike than you think. Alike? You and me? We are both gamblers. We like pushing things to the edge. The last time I fucked some other guy's wife, I think it was a week after my own honeymoon. I got this terrific boil right on the back of my neck. It took all I had not to become a religious fanatic. That's the difference between us. I still believe people pay for their sins. That's a good thing, Danny, because you're going to pay for yours. It's alright, I'll take him. Amy? Can you change that around for me, turn it around? Turn the sign around, look. Yeah, thank you. Joe's Fish. - Hey Dad. - Danny? Is Nick there? I'd like to speak with him, please. No, Man. He's out, he does deliveries now. How long has he been out? Ah, a couple of hours, he should be back any minute. Why? Dad, he's never coming back. He left with my wife. What the hell is wrong with you? Amy and my kid are gone. They left...with your... They left with your first mate, your boy. Did you hear me, captain? It's not just fish he's been delivering, Dad. It's not just shad that he's been boning. Listen, I hear you, okay Danny? But if Amy and Peter left, they left on their own. Nick just came in. He came through the door. It's Danny. - Put him on. - He wants to talk to you. - Hey Danny, how're you doing? - Where are they, brother? Did you give them money? Did you put them on a plane, Nick? On a bus? Danny. I don't know what you're talking about. Okay, it's okay. Sorry. Can you put the boss on, please? Joe! You think I'm nuts, I know, Dad. Do you think I'm making this up? Listen, I think you're hurt. And I think you just have to calm down, alright? Alright, alright, I do need to calm down, Dad. I do need to calm down. And while I'm fucking calming down, Dad ... I think you, Dad ... I think you need to take a look at your freezer. My freezer? As soon as I hang up, Dad, as soon as I hang up, check the money in the vault, Dad. Make sure it's all there. - Why wouldn't it be there? - Because your boy, your boy, is a thief. What the fuck gives you that idea, Danny? I just know, I know, okay? He's up to something, him and my wife. They got a plan to meet somewhere, and they stole money from the vault so they could run away together. And after checking that out, Genius, ask the mother fucker about your wife. What's that, Danny? What's going on, Joe? There are supposed to be ten of these here. Ten what, Joe? You don't know what these are? Open it. There's only nine. So what? How do I know you're telling me the truth, Man? The truth about what? We got a problem. - What kind of problem? - Your son. He says Nick's beem fucking his wife ... and they're planning to run away together. Why, he's crazy. He's, he's, he's lying. Yeah, well, Amy's gone with Peter, and so's one of these packets. It was me who took the money, Joe. I gave it to Danny. You gave Danny money behind my back? He was broke, ashamed for you to know. I don't like this. I don't like what this shit's all about. If you ain't fucking Danny's wife, how come he hates you so much? Why don't you ask Danny. He seems to know everything else. It's funny. He told me to ask you something. He called you a mother fucker and said I should ask you about my wife. You know what, Joe? Nick. Where are you going? I'm walking out of here, just like I walked in. I'm leaving. What Danny said, it's justs another lie, isn't it? I mean, you're not going with Amy, are you? I'm leaving, I'm just going. I got the money. More than 300 thousand. It's not just mine. It's yours too. Money? Joe ... I love him. It's nobody's fault, Joe. It just happened. How I wish I could change everything, but I can't. It won't go away. I'm sorry, Joe. You're sorry, you're sorry! You've gone too far! You son of a bitch, I trusted you! No! Nick! Stop it! stop it! No, don't! Joe, I'm so sorry. Get out, fucking get out! When did you start fucking her? When did you start to feel like a man cleaning shad? I need an ambulance! please! My husband is having a heart attack! 411 Central Ave. Joe, hold on! please! He's dead, he's dead, he's dead!! I'm sorry! I would like to see my mother through my baby eyes again. I would like to just remember what she was like way back then. You were so good to me, Joe ... You were good to me. You were good to me, Joe, so fucking good to me. ... I was a phony bastard. I was a phony bastard, Joe! I was just a phony bastard! I know I was a phony! Just a phony! No, I am! You're crazy, Joe said. The things you do with the cards you're dealt. Like the shad, some of us get caught, some get away. I got something for you. The boss's knife. Come on, take it. You took everything else. Finish this up. Go ahead and kill me. I'm not afraid to die. I do standup, remember? Fisherman! So long, brother.
