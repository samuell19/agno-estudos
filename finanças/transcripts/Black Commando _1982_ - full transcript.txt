(classical piano music) (loud exploding) (guns firing) (classical piano music) (helicopter whirring) - We're sitting here wait for the OAU to decide whether inter African force is necessary. It's insane. I'm not gonna wait. I'm just gonna get the Red Cross volunteers and go myself. - I'm sorry, Deedee, but we can't authorize a help mission without adequate protection, it would be suicide. We'll have to wait. - Suicide either way. In a month the epidemic is going to spread through half of Africa. - Maybe there is a way. The black commandos. - Green Berets? (soldiers shouting) (soldiers shouting) (dramatic classical music) - General Othello. - Let's start, what's the matter? (dramatic piano music) - General, the objective our mission is complex. (energetic piano music) We desperately need your help. (energetic piano music) - [Desdemona Voiceover] God, who the hell does he think he is? What a pompous ass. - [Othello Voiceover] A rich Boston girl. Epidemiology. - [Desdemona Voiceover] Six months in the French Military Academy, and he gets thrown out. I wonder if he ever got in. An officer calls him black and he punches him, good lord he must be blind. - [Othello Voiceover] Father senator, uncle general, she thinks she's a feminist. You wanna come play humanitarian in Africa? Maybe with daddy's help, they'll nominate you for a Nobel Prize. - [Desdemona Voiceover] Paid to kill, oh god he's disgusting. At this point, I don't have a choice. I'd shake hands with the devil if I had to. - What do you care about a thousand, or five million? You want excitement, you're gonna get it. But your little safari is going to cost you. - Your reputation is the greatest guarantee for us for our mission. We must halt this epidemic. This will be a humanitarian as well as a military victory. And history will take it into account. - Alright. You'll have to excuse me. Iago will explain the financial conditions of the contract. Gentlemen. - May I be of service to you, Mr.? - [Ludovic] Stafford. - Stafford, Mr. Stafford, yes. How can I help you, sir? - This is a humanitarian mission. - Oh humanitarian mission, yes. Humanitarian, Mr. Stafford? Well charity begins at home. (dramatic drum music) - Hey, should I give it to him? - Hey kid, watch it. - [Soldier] Okay, ready. (dramatic classical music) - Who are you? What do you want? Are you missionaries? Sure you are. Who is your leader? You can kill me now but you will not leave the hills alive. I have 300 men in the camp. - No, 1,006. We're not after you. We're making the way for the Red Cross. So, go ahead tell your guys to make a good reception. We'll stay 24 hours. But you, and your officers will answer with your own lives for our safe departure. - You're Othello, aren't you? - Bingo! (helicopters whirring) - [Iago] Desdemona Ferguson. - Welcome. We had lost all hope. We thought that the world would let us die like animals. But it was not necessary to come here with a landing force. - [Soldier] Tell that to eight soldiers who was with us last week. - This is a bitter war between brothers and renegades. (speaking in foreign language) They do not respect the law and dishonor our people. - This armed intrusion is not only against all our principles, but it is against the Geneva Convention, we're truly sorry. Really. (helicopters whirring) - Listen, you have 21 hours. Do you wanna lose this time over pleasantries? (rhythmic drumming music) - [Desdemona] What's going on here? - They want their food. - Well why don't they distribute the food? - Priority to the soldiers first. Food is scarce. All shipments from the Red Cross up here get lost in the docks or sold on the black market in the capital. Miss, you will have to vaccinate the soldiers first, or no deal. (gentle classical music) (dramatic classical music) - [Othello] The time is up, we have to move out. - I need more time. I mean in three, four hours maybe, but I need more time. - It's impossible. We can't fly back. It would be dangerous to stay 24 hours more. I have just 20 men. And that plane this afternoon, that flew overhead. - Then you go, get out. Go on, I'm not going to leave these men here! - That's ridiculous. We're leaving now and you're coming with us. If I have to drag you out. - You're gonna drag me out? I'd like to see you try. These men will lynch you. - Leave the job unfinished? You have four hours. Not a second more. Four hours. (dramatic classical music) (bombs exploding) (shouting) - Cassius! (bombs exploding) (people shouting) Gather the men. And Cassius to the plane with the men, hurry, bring the bazooka! (bombs exploding) (bombs exploding) Cassius, we have to do something. (bombs exploding) They're distracted. You take care of the bastards. Okay? Ready. (beeping) (bombs exploding) (guns firing) (guns firing) (guns firing) (shouting) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (shouting in foreign language) (guns firing) (grenade exploding) (shouting) (guns firing) - Let me see that. I know it's only a scratch. (gentle dramatic music) (classical piano music) - Emily, come here. The beauty and the beast. The beast on top of the animal, and trailing behind, the mongrel dog. (engine revving) Hey Michael! See ya later aligator. (laughs) Like that he named that clown second in command. Cassius has stolen the place that's rightfully mine. What does that gutless one know about command soldiers? Where would he have been without me? In bed with that (speaking in foreign language). And now, you know what his Royal Highness does? He retires me to a diplomatic affair, to the pastures. And you, the only thing he hasn't said is you, whore, take her I don't want her anymore. Repulsive, it makes me sick. That Boston bitch. I mean, it makes me sick. This chimpanzee hands, those thick lips. And he smells. - He doesn't smell. - All niggers smell. - He doesn't smell. - Listen whore! - Go ahead, hit me, I'll tell him and he'll cut you to pieces. Coward. There's no secret to it except that he's much more a man than you will ever be! - Well I'll tell you something, this is not the way the story's gonna end. They're not gonna cut me to pieces without a fight. That Boston bimbo, she got him quivering like a chocolate pudding. Get out of here! Please. They haven't heard the last of me. My time grows less. Without some more, I have no peace. My hate grows more. Touch me, mother that be. Soothe me, father dear, show me skies unclouded. I cannot stay here. - The agreement foresees, the evacuation of the national bases. However, just know that Bethancourt insists that your commander unit remain until you have completed your forces of a new whichever, national place. Under the leadership of Colonel Montano. The America government. (tone beeps) - Yes, excuse me a moment. General Othello. - [Soldier] Had trouble with interference, somebody called for it. (helicopter whirring) - Listen you. I'm the United States senator and don't you try to interfere with Congress. - [Othello] I'm sorry, this is urgent. - I come with you. - [Othello] If you'd like. - I demand to see my daughter at once. My daughter Desdemona Ferguson. I want you to know that my daughter's fiance Mr. Broderick, gentleman, is still with me. Arrest him. Arrest him, you hear me? - [Othello] Hold it. And where are you from? - America has very specific laws about kidnapping. I denounce the kidnapping of my daughter. - Our laws are as strict as yours are with regard to kidnapping. Everything in our power. - Othello! Dad! Oh my god. Oh my god. What are you doing here? Oh dad, so good to see you. Broderick! Oh dad. What's going on? - Miss Ferguson, the senator has accused the general of kidnapping you. - Look at this face. Dad I've never been happier in my life. You can't come chasing after me with the seventh cavalry every time I have an affair. - Deedee, with all your upbringing and your education. How could you possibly go to, go to. - I know, I know, it's hard to say. Slept with a black man. - [Ferguson] I can't believe it. I simply can't believe it. I've lost my little girl. - No. - [Ferguson] I've lost my daughter. - No, dad, no you haven't. - These people practice nothing but witchcraft. Lord only knows how many spells he's cast upon you. - No, no spells. We're married. You can call him son. - Call that bastard, that nigger, my son? My son? You must be out of your mind. Never. Never, do you hear? (helicopter whirring) - I will have to be the first to congratulate you. And tomorrow we will have a party at my residence for the newlyweds. (fireworks crackling) (upbeat drumming music) (fireworks crackling) (upbeat drumming music) (upbeat funky music) - Michael, Michael! Michael, what's your hurry, where's the fire? - You know, how I feel about stag parties. That's about it. (singing in foreign language) We have half our men on leave and settle any skirmishes with the local people. - Come on, have a drink. General and you're dried up? To the regiment. - No, no alcohol. (upbeat funky music) - Long life to the newlyweds! (cheering) - Michael, come on Michael. Bethancourt is watching you. Long live the newlyweds. - Long live the newly weds. - Michael, another one, come here. For the general, Othello. Thank you. To the regiment. ♫ You gotta change it baby, yeah ♫ Baby ♫ You gotta change it, baby - Come on, Michael. Come on, the last one, the last one. To Othello. ♫ You gotta hold ♫ Oh no, you gotta change, baby You're not drunk, are you? - No, surely not me. (low speaking) Here's to General Othello! (speaking in foreign language) - Gotta make my rounds. - I'm worried, you know that? I'm worried. I think he's had a little too much to drink. Just a little too much to drink. (upbeat funky music) - See ya later. - Whore. - Yes, whore. You whores always end up with queers. Don't worry, they're only strong when they're going blue. (funky instrumental music) (scuffling) - Hey, Major Cassius needs help. He's alone against a bunch of guys. - What? Hey! (upbeat funky music) - Quick, Black Berets are really giving your guys a beating. - What? You two, follow me. (upbeat funky music) (fireworks exploding) (upbeat funky music) - Stop it, it's not the-- (scuffling) (chuckling) - Is there some explanation for this? - I'm sorry, sir. - [Bethancourt] You don't know how to drink, don't drink. - Is it true? You've been drinking? - I'm sorry, sir. - Not half as much I am. You are under arrest. Iago! - Yes, sir! - [Othello] Mr. President, I would like to offer my apologies and if your excellency would permit it, I would like to retire. - No apologies necessary, my dear friend. A good fight among soldiers is very healthy. (low speaking) Now let us continue with the party, huh? - I don't want the responsibility. It's not for me. You're, it's good for you. You like the responsibility. For me, I like to be the power behind the throne. You see, why do you think they call me The Rat? - How do you know? - Yes, I know. - It's a joke? - Yeah, some joke. - Sounds marvelous. It won't work. Othello holds a grudge. He won't forget. I tried. I tried to call to say sorry but he wouldn't even take the call. - But he can't take the call, he's not here. He left early at dawn to go check the anti guerrilla post with the patrol, at the border. - [Michael] Oh yeah, that's right. - Wait a minute. Wait a minute, I got it. You know what you should do? You should talk to Deedee, she's a good friend of yours. Othello will do anything she says. That's what you gotta do. Go over to Deedee, explain everything to her. She'll tell Othello and everything is. - There you are, like new again. - Think so? - Yeah, I think so. - Yeah, we're pretty good friends. - So you know what you should do? You should get dressed, shave, comb your hair, put on some nice clothes and go see Deedee. - But I'm confined to quarters. - I am the commanding officer, the commander in chief, and I say to you, get dressed, look nice, take the day off and go see Deedee. - Thanks buddy, you're a damn good guy. - I certainly am. (laughs) (people chattering) Alright. Hi, you got some money? Come on, give me some money. - Listen, up to now, I've done everything you've asked me to do. Don't you think I stuck my neck out far enough at the brawl party? And all you bring is a roll of film to be developed. - Yeah but-- - What could be of interest of the pictures of Deedee talking to Cassius? No, I'm not so sure about this anymore. You're not getting one more penny until she's safely away from here. - Don't worry. Will you stop worrying? Everything's alright. You're gonna get Deedee back. All I want from you is the film and I need some money. - Are you threatening me? - I'm not threatening you. Maybe. (people chattering) - Hey, Iago! Where's Cassius? It's been a week since that jerk showed up at my place and I know you were there. - Cassius, yeah he's confined to quarters. But surely he misses you, Bianca. Go see him, huh? I'm resolved. - Okay. - And more papers. Damn bureaucracy. That's for you, Iago. - You still saving the world? I feel very lucky today, Othello, you better watch out. Does Cassius know? - You know that he's under arrest. - Well, I also know you promised to release him. - Alright alright, I guess you're right. Those asses of Montano's needed a good lesson. As Bethancourt said, a good fight. Iago, tell Cassius very free, no more. - [Iago] Now? - We're finished here. - Look, Othello-- - But I can't play tennis him, though. The guys can't see me playing tennis with Cassius. - I don't know anything about your military affairs but Michael's feelings are hurt, please talk to him. - Okay, I'll talk to him. - Okay. I'm gonna go pick up Emily and I'll meet you in the court. And please bring Cassius, we're playing doubles. Okay. (energetic piano music) - Is there anything else, sir? - Thank you. Hey, Iago! - Yes, sir. - Tell me. How do we know when this man was on guard duty at my house? - Day before yesterday. That was the day you went to the border inspecting it. - You know, the men slack off when you're not here. Is there some reason? Is something wrong? Can I help you in any way? - No no, thank you, sorry. (dramatic instrumental music) When the cat's away, the mice will play. (scuffling) (speaking in foreign language) - In double count! March. - After that race sir, some men will sleep tonight. (laughs) Othello, $50 bet with you on the target practice. - [Othello] $50? Why not? - Come on. - Hey take it easy, man. Okay, come on, after you? Come on! (groaning) (gun firing) You son of a bitch! - I am. (low speaking) - What's that? A group of recruits? - Come on, start moving! What are you doing, sleeping? Keep your heads down! - Here's your 50. - I'll take it. What's wrong with them? Are they bored? - Othello, they're not motivated, they're not driven. These men, they're adventurers. Fighting, looting, lusting. Looting, raping, loving. That's what they want and that's why they follow you blindly. Besides, the men and the officers are a little uneasy. - What do you mean? - Rumors, you know gossips, you know what I mean. - [Othello] And what do these rumors have to say? - Othello, you've always been able to count on my loyalty. - Stop beating around the bush, get to the point. - It's a bit, delicate, you know. - You're starting to irritate me. Come on, talk. - Othello, the men say that they've lost their leader. That Othello is not Othello anymore. We go out on Boy Scout outings with the Red Cross. Othello gets married and he moves away from the troops. Remember the night of the fight? They say that if Othello was not married, he'd have taken off his jacket and he'd taken a dozen of them. That's what the men say. - Blah blah blah. The men say and the men think. And what about you, Iago? What do you think? - I don't worry about the consequences of your marriage, Othello. Not important. But I know your temper and I know if you get jealous, you could destroy the unity of this outfit. - That's bullshit. I'm not a jealous person and if someone gives a compliment to my wife I don't see any reason to shoot him. - Of course not, but I don't like to see your reputation dragged through the mud, or Cassius either. - What's happened to Cassius now? - It's not important, it's just I don't think that Michael should see Deedee now. - Explain yourself. - Unfortunately I'm put in the position where I have to be the camp gossip. I don't like that part, I don't feel comfortable in it and I don't wanna get anybody in trouble Othello. - I suppose with all that double talk you're referring to these. Some discovery that spy made. Cassius and you are always in my home, what a joke. Isn't that ridiculous? Cassius and Deedee? I don't know who's behind this hoax, but you are going to find out. - I better go. It's getting late. - You've got a hot number lined up. (gentle instrumental music) - It's terrible. You're all nuts, ever since I've been with you. You know I've stopped seeing my friends. I don't know why. They were a lot more generous and attentive than you. (door knocking) - Who is it? - [Iago] Iago. - Didn't you hear? Open up, it's Iago. (energetic piano music) - Am I interrupting something? - No, I was just leaving. - I hate you, but I'll have dinner with you tomorrow. See you, Iago. - Bianca. Oh, Bianca, Bianca. Here, I think you forgot something. Cassius, know something? I think you should marry that girl. - Are you kidding? She's garbage. - Come on. What are you talking about, she loves you! - Yeah. Today she's in love with me, tomorrow with you. Right now she's running back to her master's bed. He's the one who pays. Problem is, the girl is about as horny as they get. - This is important information. It would be a blow to Bethancourt if we eliminate his guerilla we could cut his body guards to shreds. This is the time not to relax in our country. But I am confused and that is very very dangerous that is why I think that you should be our guest till all is over. - But that wasn't the arrangement. - No buts, you'll stay here. This could be a set up. If the gentleman betrayed his friends, perhaps he could be tempted to play with us. - [Othello] I don't like this. They haven't fixed the main road yet. This smells like an ambush. (guns firing) (guns firing) - Let's get down, assistance will be here any minute. (guns firing) - Right on, here comes the calvary. (speaking in foreign language) We'll give them a hand? These guys could lose an elephant in a flower patch. - We arrived just on time, huh? General, I am sorry, but I have to inform you that the revolutionary soldiers received information of your whereabouts. - Who knew about my visit to the river? - Me, sir, Cassius of course and the men probably at the post. - No. Montano didn't know about that. It was a surprise. - Oh my god. I, I, I'm sorry but it's impossible. I can't believe it. No, it can't be. I must have told someone, general. Somehow I must have written down a memo or something. Someone, that's the only leak that I can think of. - Don't waste your time. Have you found out anything? - General, I, I don't think you would like to hear this, Othello. - Come on. No secrets from me now. - [Iago] I saw Deedee leave the house. You know she's a sweet girl, I never said that, (muffled speaking) - [Michael] Are you kidding? She's garbage. - [Iago] She seems, she's a sweet girl, what are you talking about? She seems to be in love with you. - [Michael] Today she loves me, tomorrow she loves you. She's running back right now to her master's bed. He's the one who pays. The problem is that the girl is about as horny as they get. - [Iago] Look, Cassius, I mean aren't you afraid you could be, you could end up regretting, regretting it? I mean you're a business man, what are you doing? - [Michael] No way. That's the good part. This monkey is too proud of himself that he doesn't know the poor girl is frustrated. - Oh no no, please. Please, Othello, general listen to me. Don't do it. Please do not do it. You must listen to me, it's most important. You cannot, you cannot, you have to be above the affairs of the bed. I mean, you know you will lose the credibility of the men, may I be frank? Let me be frank with you, huh? You must not look like a frustrated lover looking for revenge. Please listen to me, Othello. I am to blame. I am to blame. I will take care of everything, I must do it, I must do it. I have neglected my duty. I have endangered your life and the very existence of our unit. Please, Othello. - You are not responsible. My vanity, General Othello. You take care of her too, she has to leave. No! I have to do it, by myself. I have to do it. Look, thank you. (shouts) - These instructions come straight from the defense committee. - Are you familiar with the contents of these documents? - That is the objective of my mission. To inform our ambassador and Colonel Montano. Is anything wrong, sir? - They've summoned me to Washington and named Major Cassius as commander of the unit. - We'll miss you, general. (door knocking) - Ludo, oh Ludo! Oh, how are you? - You never called. Not even a postcard to your family. - Good friends. - Since we were babies. I know, I know I'm sorry. - They literally forced me to come bring these orders personally to General Othello. - Monsieur Stafford brings promotion orders for Cassius. - For Cassius? Oh, Othello I'm so happy. - That's enough. Get out. I said get out! - How can you treat Deedee that way? - I don't remember asking your opinion on my personal affairs. Just stick to your official mission. Tomorrow I will pass the command on to Major Cassius. Gentlemen. (classical instrumental music) - Emily, you don't let one slip by you, do you? Thank you. - What do you think they do? They classify us as if we were cattle. Emily's a fox, did you see Deedee's legs? - Poor Othello. Maybe I shouldn't have left him alone tonight. - He's probably not mad, he broke something. But when he finishes getting violent, he becomes like a kitten. - You know him very well don't you? - How long have you known? - Oh, since the first time I saw you in the living room. You were eating him up with your eyes. - There was never another time after. - Cassius? - From time to time, for purely physiological reasons. - I see. How about Titi? - Oh that one is still a little green. - Aren't you worried about Iago? What if he finds out? - He knows, but he's a coward. He's afraid of Cassius and I'd rather not even talk about Othello. He hates them both. He's a bad seed, Deedee, watch out for him. - Why don't you leave him? - Where would I go? You don't know where I come from and I sure don't wanna go back there. I have everything I want, guys, jewels, and a whole regiment. As long as he leaves me alone, I won't tell anyone that he's impotent and effeminate. (classical instrumental music) (car breaks screeching) (car crashing) (suspenseful instrumental music) (dramatic foreboding music) - And what about the National Guard? (phone ringing) (soldiers chattering) Okay, yeah yeah yeah. Hello? (phones ringing) (soldiers chattering) - [Soldier] Sir, there's a woman, a friend of Major Cassius who called the police. - Is Major Cassius dead? Talk to them. - Hello? Hello? Yes. Yes. Yes. What's you're name? (phone ringing) Sir, she just repeats that Michael is dead. I can't understand her very well, she seems to be crying. She says her name is Bianca or Blanca. - Notify Colonel Leogovic. And tell him to take care of everything. (guns firing) (guns firing) (car screeching) (bomb exploding) (gentle instrumental music) - What happened to Cassius? - You can make contact with Iago at headquarters. - I'm going there now, does Deedee know? - Tell me, did you know about Deedee and Cassius? - Who? Deedee? You're out of your mind. Hey, you're hurting me. Let go, so that's what was bugging you this afternoon. If it wasn't such a sad moment I would laugh my guts out. I'm going to see what's happening. Since you've been strapped up. Hey listen, don't go telling Deedee this joke. You'll make a fool of yourself. - Excuse me, sir. Any news about Major Cassius? - Nothing yet. (tone beeps) General Othello, to Officer of the Guard. I want the guard at my residence relieved immediately, I want him punished for neglecting his duties. - Affirmative, over. Shit, what could he have done? - He said neglecting his duties. Probably Deedee. - Let's go, immediately means now. (gentle piano music) - Othello, what are you doing in the dark? - Don't touch me, whore. (gentle piano music) Where do you think you're going? I'm talking to you. - Anywhere I don't have to put up with your insults. You plan to lock me in? Othello, what's happened to us? You insult me, you call me a whore and now you lock the door? I'm going home. If you decide to reach me, you'll know where I am. - I am not a busboy you can dismiss. - Oh god, I don't even now you anymore! - Nobody moves from here without my permission. - Please, please let me go home. You're not yourself. And you won't talk to me, you won't tell me what I've done. Please open the door and let me go while I still love you. It's better for both of us. - How easy you make everything seem. That Othello really crashed your party. Everything was well planned with your part time lover. But the rejected husband decided to put up a fight. - Oh my god, this isn't happening. Oh god, this is a nightmare. God, please let me wake up. Othello, you've gone mad. - Mad? Yes, mad, I'm crazy. I have to be crazy to believe I'm the only one for you. I don't wanna insult prostitutes. They're only doing they're duty. - Can I at least know the name of my lover? - She knows that she's been discovered and doesn't have the decency to confess. Everybody in the capital knows about you. Every time you jump into bed with Cassius. Everybody knows it! - I'm not even gonna waste my breath defending myself against such lies! You call Cassius here and let him say this to me! - [Othello] That would be difficult. He's dead. - [Desdemona] What? - He's dead. A jealous lover was waiting for him outside Bianca's house. Didn't he tell you about Bianca? And bang bang bang, finished the playboy. - Michael, it's not true. No please tell me it's not true. - So you loved him that much. This is better than a thousand confessions. - I don't care what you think anymore. Where did they take him? - In the alleyway. He's dying like a rat. - I never thought I could despise you. - Who are you to despise me? How soon you've forgotten your offering of love. Sex. Sex, just sex. Nymphomaniac. High society girl. Sex. Love me, what a sensation. The doctor brought a black man from the dead. I am the boss here and I can squash you like a bug. Like your partner. - You killed him? Oh my god you're not human! Murderer! Murderer! Help me, somebody help me! Help me! - Quiet! - Somebody help me! Murderer! - Be quiet! - Murderer! Let me go. - Quiet! - Help me somebody! - Shut up! - Help me! - Shut up! - Help me somebody! - [Othello] Be quiet. Shut up! Be quiet, be quiet, shut up, shut up. Deedee! - Did you hear that? - What's that? - Maybe we should go and take a look. - [Soldier] What would we say? General we were just passing by, we heard voices in there. - Yeah, you're under arrest for disturbing the peace. And The Rat is under arrest for speeding. - What goes on? - Nothing's wrong sir. The men ought to be here now, now that Cassius survived the attack. - [Iago] What? - [Soldier] We are waiting. Waiting for a new call sir. - Does the general know that? - He gave strict orders not to be disturbed. - Don't just stand there. I'm telling you, he seemed strange to me. - What do you want me to do about it? - I'm not a soldier, so I'm going in there. - Major Cassius has eliminated the three terrorists who attacked him. (dramatic music) - He's alive? - Yes, I tried to call you on the phone but you didn't answer so I thought it was disconnected and that Cassius is alive. - Lucky man. He's as guilty as she was. And now he's alive and arrogant. He didn't care. - It's, it's the ambassador and the envoy from the state department I didn't get a chance to tell you they were coming. - General, I was glad to hear that Major Cassius survived the attempt on his life. However, there is certain unrest in the city that you and your men had planned to seek out the attackers. Without a doubt. (building dramatic music) - You killed her. - She was guilty. - You killed her! - For the love of god, who did he kill? - That's the great Othello, killed his wife in a fit of madness! Your soul is blacker than your skin! - [Ambassador] That's enough. - Don't you have enough? You're all standing there like fools afraid to make the slightest movement that would upset his majesty the tyrant! And inside that house that poor girl's body is turning cold. Cassius's lover? Poor fool! - Tell her, Iago. - Iago, of course. You poor fool, that rat tricked you! - Go home, go home Emily, go home. - Or what would you do? Feel pretty brave tonight. Wait till Cassius arrives. She never cheated on you in body or in mind. He hates you! - Shut up. - For humiliating him. - Shut up. - He hates Cassius for stealing his job! He hated Deedee because she despised him! - Shut up, go home! - [Emily] And he can't keep his wife home in bed. He's impotent and a faggot! - Shut up! - [Emily] Do not believe him! - [Iago] Get out of here! (dramatic instrumental music) - [Emily] Let me go. Let go! Cassius! Cassius! They killed Deedee, they killed her! - Don't make a move, rat. We caught your friend Broderick and he told us how you planned the attack on Othello. Sunny! Get his gun. - You're the guilty one. You! You! You, you, you! Othello! I had nothing to do with it. I was only following your orders! Mon general. I had nothing to do with it, nothing. It was all his orders! He's the one who created this drama, not me! Arrest him, arrest him! I've only been loyal to you, Cassius, everyone else has conspired against you, not me Othello, I'm your friend. I didn't, arrest him! He killed his wife! You saw him, she's dead! In the house. - Kill him. (guns firing) (somber instrumental music) - Oh god, what butchery. General Montano, on behalf of my government, I insist that you arrest General Othello. He must be tried in a court of law. - Let's see you try. This camp has an extra territorial status and you're a foreigner here. - [Montano] This is insubordination. - We're under martial law. Any civilian who oppose the military authority will be shot. Sunny! - Sir! - Prepare the helicopters, we'll be leaving in 15 minutes. - Make ready for evacuation! - [Michael] Any other orders, sir? - No, thank you. When all the men have boarded, notify me. (gun firing) (dramatic piano music)
