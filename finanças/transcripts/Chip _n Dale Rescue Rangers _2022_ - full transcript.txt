Hello, hello. Good morning. Come along now. Simon, no headphones. You'll get these back after school. Betty, you're not Donald Duck! Put some pants on, please! - Okay. What's the first thing... - Okay, kids. Have fun at school! - ...that pops into your head... - Bye, Dad! - ...when I say Chip 'n Dale? - Hey, stop bumping me! I'm willing to bet it's Thomas Chippendale, the London-based cabinet maker from the 1700s. Sick cabinet, Thomas! But I bet the second thing that pops into your head are these guys. But certainly, third would be those rascally cartoon chipmunks, Chip 'n Dale, or should I say Chip and me? And it all started the day we met, when I had to join a new school in the middle of third grade. Hello, potential new friends! We have a new student today. Everyone, say hello to Dale. Hello, everyone. Nice to meet you! Uh... I know. My eye! It's in my eye! - No, no, no, no. - Get it out! Uh... It's a joke. See? I'm fine. Ew. You're weird. By lunchtime, no one wanted anything to do with me. So, I had to sit alone. Hey. Mind if I sit? That pencil thing you did was hilarious! It was excellent comic timing. - Really? I kind of wish I hadn't done it. - No way, man. The biggest risk is not taking any risk at all. You just didn't set up the joke right. I can help you if you want. - The name's Chip. - I'm Dale. So, do you watch Crispy Cow? - Hey! That's my milk! - Hey! That's my milk! Chip was so funny and thoughtful - about everything. - So good! And I never thought about anything. We were perfect together. Friendship is rare Do you know what... - Come on! - And even though, - we were in the same grade... - Follow me! ...Chip was like the older brother I never had. He introduced me to cheesy crust pizza and funny, old movies. By high school we were headlining the talent show. And for our grand finale, The Amazing Dale will juggle everything! Hey! Ow, ow, ow, ow. Ah! We knew we had something special. So, after graduation, we packed our bags - and headed to California. - You're late! Come on! Move, move, move! Here, catch! - Nice one! - Aw. Hello, potential new friends! Goodbye, eclectic group of bus passengers. Oh, what if I did something like, "I'm into nuts." Good, good. I love it. Great stuff. Those first few months, we were flat broke, but they were some of the best times of my life. ...when you're off, everyone knows. So be on, with Fresh-On Deodorant... - Whoa! Whoa! - We look great. And after landing a few small parts, we finally got the call that would change everything. Chip, Dale, how would you like your own show? -Sometimes some crimes -DALE: Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers. - We had finally done it! - Go slipping - Our own TV show. - Through the cracks It was about a group of little detectives... -But these two, Gumshoes -...who would solve big crimes. - There was the adventurer, Monterey Jack. - Are picking up the slack - The inventor, Gadget Hackwrench... - Ch... Ch... Ch... Chip 'n Dale! - ...and Zipper, a fly. - Rescue Rangers His things were, he was small and he couldn't speak, - a double threat. - When there's danger Ch... Ch... Ch... Chip 'n Dale! And then there was Chip and I, we were a classic odd couple with Chip as the logical straight man... - Pass me that pipe. I've got an idea. - ...and me as the fun-loving goof. - Right, what are you gonna do with it? - You're mine now. Ah. Birds! Why you little... Come here, you. - No! - I guess the cat's in the bag. And cut. That's a wrap, folks. Nice work, everyone! Great job! And so, I just wanna thank all of you for the greatest three years of my life. When I think back to where this all started, me finding Dale sitting all alone in the cafeteria, so sad. Well, I wasn't that sad. That's funny. But never in my wildest dreams did I think we'd be here now. So, to you, Dale, my best friend, and to all of you. - And to everyone who loves a short toast. - Okay. Okay. To many more seasons of the Rescue Rangers. Cheers! - Cheers! - Cheers! Over here. Get together. Everybody say, "Cha-cha-cha-cheese! - One, two, tell me what you're... - We were living the dream. High on the hog, all night long, dancing the "Roger Rabbit," - with Roger Rabbit. - Go, Roger. Go, Roger. Go, Roger. - Go, Roger. - Boy, what a party. Oh, zipper. Oh, yeah. I love this. I am into nuts! - So good. Again, again. - Those were some crazy fun times. I'm into nuts. - So awesome. - Super fun. So fun. Now, that we found love What are we gonna do with it Hey, where'd you run off to, buddy? I saved you a piece of cake. - What's that? - Okay. I wasn't gonna show you this right now, but it just got delivered. So... Ta-da! "Double-0 Dale"? That's hilarious. What is that? It's wild, right? It's my new show. I'm gonna be a super spy. Wh... what are you talking about? Yeah, I'm really going for it. And just like you always say, "The biggest risk is not taking any risk at all." - Wait, you really have a new show? - Yep! Wh... why didn't you talk to me about it first? We tell each other everything. You've told me what you had for lunch the last 42 days. Pineapple pizza and a diet Slice. - Exactly. - I don't know. I just wanted to make sure the show was gonna happen first, - before I got your hopes up. - My hopes up? What? Yeah! It's good news for everyone. Check this out. Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho I just... If you do this, they might cancel the show. No, they won't do that. I mean, everyone knows you're the favorite. And I'm just the guy who gets hit in the head with a pipe each week. It's fine. Okay, so, you're gonna risk all of Rescue Rangers because I'm a little more popular than you? Do you know how dumb that is? Well, I am the dumb one. - I didn't mean it like that. - I know. You never mean it. Look, you're always acting like you saved me or something. But when we were kids, we were in it together. What are you talking about? We're still in it together. I'm sorry, Chip. I'm just done being second banana. But you're not second banana. I'm a banana and you're just another banana. Two bananas. - Please, don't get that. - But it could be my agent, Dave Bolinari. After everything I've done for you, do not pick up that phone. - I'm sorry. - Dale, stop. - We're not done talking. - I have to. Do not. Do not do it. I'm so sorry. Go for Dale. Hey! Dave Bolinari. Rescue Rangers was canceled that summer, and Double-0 Dale was scrapped after the pilot. - Dale, you still there? - Yeah. Yeah, I'm here. It wasn't anyone's fault in particular, just one of those showbiz things. But now, we're ready to bring it back. Rescue Rangers 2.0! Starring me. Now in new and improved 3D. - Ladies and gentlemen... - Oh, wow. You hear that? - ...are you ready for the star of the day? - Well, that's my cue to go. This has been chapter one of Dale's Tales. If you liked it, please don't forget to subscribe below. You know him from The Disney Afternoon. Please, welcome to the stage... Gotta go, bye! - ...Baloo! - Well, now. Who here likes a little jazz music? Look for the bare necessities The simple bare necessities Pardon moi, Dale, but your followers, they believe the crowd is for you? Of course they do, Lumiere. And pretty soon, \that crowd is gonna be for me. Yeah, Dale! I'm going to be up on that stage too, right beside you! - Yes, Ugly Sonic. That's the spirit. - And they'll like me for who I am, not like last time when the internet got one look at my human teeth, and burned the place down. Okay, let's see here. "Best wishes, Ugly Sonic." There you go, kid. Oh, they're laughing at me. I know that. You can't hurt my feelings if I'm in on the joke. - Are you though? - Yes! Anyway, now my luck has shifted. I've been offered a new reality show where I do ride-alongs with the FBI. It's called Ugly Sonic, Uglier Crimes. - Really? A TV show? You? - Yeah, is that so difficult to believe. Oh, uh... I guess... not. Yeah, you know what? That's great. When one of us succeeds, we all succeed. Baloo was part of the Disney Afternoon just like me. Then he got The Jungle Book reboot and boom, he's back on top. It happens that fast. Bravo, Dale! Your positivity is infectious. Oh, merci! Oh, I really needed that cash. You just gotta stay prepared. I'm keeping myself fit and you know, my updated modern look? Yes, Dale, your CG surgery was done very tastefully. - You look amazing. - Well, thank you, Tigra. - We should hang out sometime. - Nah. - Meanly fast. - No offense, but don't you think you'd have more fans here if Chip did these events with you? Oh, Chip? Oh, that's interesting. I hadn't thought about him in a while. I should give him a call. See how life's treating him. Life is the worst, which is why you need good insurance. Look, I'm not gonna put on the hard sell, but in my experience, bad things happen all the time. They happen without warning. Sometimes from the last place you'd expect it, and you're left to pick up the pieces. So, you have to protect yourself. If you're prepared for the worst, the worst isn't so bad. So, why risk it? It's my job to pull the wool off your eyes... - figuratively. - You know, I'll take the whole package. Fantastic. You're making the right choice. Hey, hey. Congrats! Employee of the month again. - Thanks, Bruno. - Wanna get a drink to celebrate? Yeah, you never hang out. Sorry, everyone. Can't tonight. Millie's waiting for me. But thanks for the invite. Are you sure you don't wanna see my new pad? Oh, pad. Frog-based humor. No, thanks. That's just a taste of what you get from me outside the work environment. - Good evening, Chip. - Hello, Mrs. House, thank you. Millie, I'm home. Flounder's disappearance marks the sixth notable cartoon to go missing in the last two months... Oh, ho ho. Get over here. Oh, there's my wittle girl. You've been cooped up all day? Okay, okay. You must be hungry. Yup! There you go. All right, slow down. - Calling all chipmunks! - The chipmunks are back. - Yeah! - And this time, they're rapping. Let's go! Chipmunks Here for more, so... Of course, they're rapping. They always have to make the cartoons rap. It's time to dance... Ooh, a message on my land line. I don't like that. G'day, Chipper! It's me, Monterey Jack. - Monty? - Hey! I know we haven't spoken in a long time. But I'm in a heck of a lot of trouble. And I could use some help from a friend. I'd really appreciate if you could come and see me at my place. All right, gotta go. Hope to see you soon. Oh, wow. It's been so long. Quick! - Get in while the coast is clear. - Oh, Monty. It's you. I'm sorry about that, mate, but they're watching. - They're always watching. - Who are? - Oh, it's been too long, Chip. - It really has, old buddy. I... I'm sorry, Monty, but what is that God-awful smell? What? You don't remember? Rescue Ranger's cologne. I wear it every day. Oh, no. I remember. It smells like almond butter and gasoline. And it's very difficult to wash out. Right. So, Monty, what's going on? I got your voicemail. You said you were in trouble? I screwed up, Chip. My love of cheese got the best of me. - And I bought more than I could pay for. - Oh, no. Cheese? Monty. I know, I know. But I haven't had so much as a whiff in weeks. I'm dairy-free. - Really? Then what's that? - Oh, crud. It's a really stinky Gorgonzola. You weren't supposed to see that. Ch... ch... ch... ch... ch... ch... cheese! Hang on, Monty. Ugh... I'm sorry, Chipper. I just love it so much. It's okay, Monty. We'll get you some help. It's not just that, Chip. Now, I owe a ton of money to the Valley Gang. The Valley Gang? Monty, those guys are bad news. I know. And if I can't pay up, they're gonna bootleg me. "Bootleg you"? What does that mean? Oh, Chip. It's gotten rough out there for us old-timers. Did you hear what happened to that little guy, Flounder? When he fell behind on krill payments? Oh, no! - Time to pay up, fish. - Um. How about this? Isn't it neat? Come on, fellas. This is a genuine Dinglehopper. It's worth a lot. Oh! So, they kidnap the bloke, erase his mouth so he can't scream, then change him around to try to sneak by the copyright laws, and then smuggle him overseas to a black-market studio, where he'll spend the rest of his life being forced to make terrible bootleg movies. Oh, no, that's awful. We can't let that happen to you. - We'll figure something out. - You mean it? Of course, you were always such a good friend to me. You never let me down. I've really missed you, you big galoot! Oh, I missed you too, Chipper. I know Gadget and Zipper miss you also. - Yeah? How are they doing? - Oh, they're great. - Forty-two kids and counting. - Wow, look at that. That one's got Gadget's eyes and Zipper's wings. And that one's got her ears and hands, cute. We had some good times, didn't we, pal? Aye, the best. They're here! Hide! Hello? Is that... That's 59 steps to get up to your apartment. You do a couple of those a day and you're in... - Quick! Get in! - Okay. Oh. - Dale... - Chip. - Hey. - Yep, it's me. - Cool. - Yeah, I called Dale for help also. - I hope that's okay. - Yeah, why wouldn't it be okay? I mean, it is, uh, okie-dokie artichokie. - "Artichokie"? For real? - Yes. "Artichokie." So, you're not still mad about all the stuff with, you know, Double-0 Dale and Rescue Rangers getting canceled? Mad? No. I'd be pretty pathetic to care about something from that long ago. Oh. Okay. I mean, you can care a little if you want to. I mean, I care, but... - So, what's been up with you? - Oh, you know this, that, other vague things to fill the space of this conversation. - Okay, well, you look the same. - Yeah. Thanks. And you look... different. Ah! Hey, it's no secret I had the CGI surgery done and it's done wonders rejuvenating my career. I'm actually starring in a play tonight... But, man, I tell you the real hot ticket is Rescue Rangers. There's even some buzz about a reboot. Someone started a Facebook fan page - for it and everything. - Crikey! A Facebook fan page? - They don't just give those away. - Oh, he's full of it, Monty. No one's talking about a Rescue Rangers reboot except for him. What? The fans are hungry for it. Look, I came here to help Monty, not get caught up in some Hollywood nonsense. So, great to take this skip down memory lane, but I've gotta go. Monty, if you're really in trouble, you know how to find me. Dale, you were also here. Come over to try and help Monty, ambush me, talking about a reboot... think they can squeeze a dollar out of essentially nothing. He's the one that quit the show in the first place. I've been fine without it. It's garbage. Total garbage. That's why it's better to not even have friends. Okay, yeah, that one looks pretty good. So weird, I mean... It's, like, "What are you talking about?" Totally. Hey, guys, you wanna hang after the show tonight? I know a great place for cheesy-crust pizza. Oh, um, I'm sorry, man, but we got other plans, you know? Yeah. I think the ironic guest performer wants to be friends. Go for Dale. E.T. forgive Bat. Fine. Yeah, right. Like that would happen. - Hello. - Hey, it's Dale. Don't hang up. Look, I just got a call from the police and Monty's been kidnapped. - What? Are you serious? - Yeah, it's crazy. The cops want a statement from us since we were the last people he talked to. I'm gonna head back to his apartment. I'll meet you there, okay? - Chip, you're here. - Of course. Come on. Poor Monty. Huh. Toad, take this to the lab. You're the friends of the victim? You got anything for me? Any known enemies or threats? Yeah, actually, Monty told me he was in debt to the Valley Gang? He was afraid of being bootlegged since he was somewhat of a star in the early '90s. He was on the Rescue Rangers. We were on the show together. Chip 'n Dale, Rescue Rangers? - When you need help, just call... - Never heard of it. - What? - This is my fault. I shouldn't have left. Well, it eats me up inside to have to tell you this, but if he's been taken by the Valley Gang, I doubt we can help you. We've been trying for years to track those sleaze bags. A fella named Sweet Pete, runs the whole operation, - and he's always one step ahead of us. - What? So, that's it? I... I thought that cops were supposed to serve and protect, not give up and move on. Hey! I'd give anything to make a case against those scum. Sweet Pete's got his fingers in every illegal business from bootlegging to stinky cheese, getting rich while we look like we just fell off the turnip truck. All done, sir. Oh! You scared the beans out of me, Steckler. Sorry, sir. - I searched the perimeter. No clues. - Yeah, of course not. Why would there be? Six missing toons in a month and not one clue. Well, maybe we should check in with the neighbors? - See if anyone saw anything? - Oh, yeah. You think? Why don't you just leave the real detective work to me, okay? - Sheesh. - Right. Sorry, sir. Chief, the press are outside waiting for a statement. - Do I have anything on my back? - Yes, sir. It looks like a Monopoly game piece and Officer O'Hara. Officer! What the... Ugh, just want one day where my shirt stays clean. Okay, pack it up, boys. Let's go. Hey! - I'm Ellie Steckler. Uh. I am a huge fan. - Really? I actually became a detective because as a little girl growing up in Albany, I wanted to help people. - Just like you guys. - No way. We are so honored. Namaste. You know that was just a TV show, right? Not real. Chip, inspiration is inspiration. Look, I heard what Putty was saying to you guys. But I don't think it's hopeless. I'm breaking some rules telling you this, but from everything that we know about bootlegging, the whole process takes about two days. - That's 48 hours. - Yeah. The problem is, we don't know where Sweet Pete's bootlegging facility is. And every time we try to get a warrant, we get so bogged down in red tape that nothing happens. But if you guys can find that bootlegging facility, I think you'll find your friend. Wow! Thank you, and thank you again for watching the show. - It really means a lot. - You are gross. - I'll be in touch. - You're amazing! Eh? - What? - You heard her. - We should go find Monty ourselves. - Are you kidding? - No! Who better to rescue Monty? - Uh, literally anyone. 'Cause from where I am standing, there's only one crime-fighting team that can solve this case. I'll call Gadget and Zipper. No, don't bother them. We're as much real detectives - as the Scooby-Doo gang. - Exactly. That's why we have to try. No! What? Chip, Monty called both of us looking for help and we let him down. We can't just let him rot in some overseas studio, being forced to make bad movies. If he's gonna make bad movies, he should be making them here with me. Okay, even if we were going to help, we have no idea where to start. We don't even know what we're... Cheese. Uh. Okay. Hey, listen. Buddy, If you're low on cash or something, - I can buy you a nice, clean sandwich. - Okay. Aha! Here it is! I threw this out when I came over earlier. "Bjornson's Cheese Shop. 3344, Main Street." Um. Did you just find a clue? You literally just sniffed out a clue! Look, we can go to the cheese shop. See what we can find out about this secret facility and Sweet Pete, then pass it along to the officer lady, but that's all we're gonna do. So, you're saying the Rescue Rangers are back? No, because there's no such thing as Rescue Rangers. Case closed. - "Case?" - No, this is not a case - because we're not real detectives. - Oh ho ho! But you did say case. Yes! - Can I help you? - Sorry. I'm just happy to see you. Chip 'n Dale, together again. Yeah. Okay. Ch... Ch... Ch... Chip 'n Dale! Rescue Rangers - Ch... Ch... Ch... Chip 'n Dale! - Stop singing the song. You know they make chipmunk-sized cars, right? Duh. But human stuff is the best. A little work done on her, and she'll be back to her glory days. Hey, watch out! Do you know what a metaphor is, Dale? If you're about to say this car is a metaphor for something about me, you can stop. Because, no, I don't know what a metaphor is. Look, if we're gonna solve... "The Case of the Missing Monty." That's just a placeholder name. Open to any ideas. - We're gonna have to work together. - We are not working together. You're funny, Chip. Ugh... Okay, we're getting close. Pull up over there. And leave the top hat and cane in the car, please. Whoa! How did you know that? - 'Cause you're you. - All right. Heads-up. Well... there's no faster way to gain someone's respect than to dress like an important business magnet. You mean business "magnate"? Uh. I think I know my own character, Chip, and he wears a top hat. Ah, this place is pretty shady. Are we sure it's safe? No. Because nothing's safe... ...on Main Street. Oh, wow. It seems kinda nice. It's not what I pictured. Trust me, it's worse. It's a bunch of cartoons trading on their wholesome public image to keep the cops away. And bring you the slimiest backwater bazaar of contraband this side of Guadalajara. You sure about that? That dog's blowing bubbles. Hello! Nothing, and I mean nothing is sacred in this part of town. Bread for sale, bread for sale -Everyone loves bread for sale -That guy, he sells untraceable weapons. Scoot, scoot A shiny shoe makes the man A shiny shoe, now there's a plan Stolen social security numbers. Roses are a way - To make a girl feel pretty... - No, thanks, kid. - Muppet fights. - Okay, why do you know all this? Well, sometimes when I'm low on cash, I sell my fur to that wig shop. Hey. Far out. -It's a stinky, it's a gooey -CHIP: Ah, here. - It's a stinky, it's a gooey... - I think this is our guy. I make deals for a living. So, just let me do the talking. - Ten-four. Got your back. - No, you don't have my back. I got this. Hi, Mr. Bjornson. Do you have any cheese for sale? Oh, do I have cheese? Let's see, we've got the Muenster, the Gouda, the Brie. Do you have any "stinky cheese?" Are you cops? No! No. We just wanna buy some stinky cheese. The stinkier, the better. All right, come on. Get in. Oh, yeah. - Oh, so good. - More, please. More, please. Choo! Choo! Hey, no more free samples, Lester. This isn't Baskin Robbins. So, you want stinky cheese? I got smell lines that'll take you through the ceiling. Ow. "Through the ceiling," huh? Seems like you offer a quality product. But hey, before we get into all that, do me a favor. Take a look at this photo. It's a friend of mine named Monterey Jack. Which is also the name of a cheese. - Continue. - Right. So, we think he's being held in a warehouse somewhere. If you know anything, I'm sure we could make it worth your while. Like, what would you say to some complementary RV or boat insurance? Nah, I don't know nothin'. Now, either buy some cheese or get out. Oh, okay. Um... Well, perhaps we should, with the disrespectful tone this felted clodhopper takes, why, I never! - What are you doing? - I am an important business magnet. I shall have no trouble attracting other suitors for my gigantic deal because that's what magnets do. They attract business. No, you two are definitely cops. You're out of here. Okay, hold on. This is getting out of hand. - We are not cops. - We're actors! It's been us, Chip 'n Dale, the whole time. Huh. Interesting. My boss, Sweet Pete, he loves actors. - Ah, yeah. Who doesn't? - You know, I think you should meet him. Really? Meeting Sweet Pete, huh? Looks like I just took us from outside the club to the VIP room. Wow! This VIP room is incredible! I'm freaking out, dude. Is that Jessica Rabbit over there? I'm only asking because I'm zip tied - in the back of a truck! - Whoa! What's with the attitude? We were about to get kicked out with your plan, and now, thanks to my sweet improv, we're going to see Sweet Pete. Oh, you're insane. - Am I? - Of course. - So, you'd rather just give up? - No! - You wanna just wait around... - You should've just let me take the lead! Hey! Hold on a second! How adorable are we? Chemistry like this doesn't just happen. This has got reboot written all over it. Ugh. Are you serious? I should be home right now. Millie is probably worried sick and peeing all over the place. Oh, are you seeing someone? She sounds... nice. - She's a dog. Millie is a dog. - Ah, I'm sure she's not that bad. What? No, she's... We're here. Whoa. This place looks weird. Where are we? Okay. I think we're in the Valley. - The Uncanny Valley. - The what? Do you remember that weird animation style in the early 2000s where everything looked real, but nothing looked right? Oh, yeah. That stuff was creepy. Well, I think this is where they ended up. Come on. This way. - What? - I got something for Sweet Pete. - A little gift from Bjornson. - Okay, leave it there. Good luck, dummies. Blend, Cheese, Curd, Blend... - Who are you? - Is he talking to us? I can't tell. He's got those Polar Express eyes. - Uh. Are you talking to us? - Obviously, I said, "Who are you?" Well, right. But in fairness, it looks like you're talking - to that window. - No, it actually looks like - I'm looking right at you. - Okay. Look at my eyes, looking right at your eyes. - Yeah. - Okay. Listen, sir. Actually, you know what? Get... Here, just... Get off me! Get your foot out of my mouth. Hey, there! Can you see me? Hi! We just wanna talk to Sweet Pete. Okay, follow me! I wonder if they're keeping Monty in here. There's only one way to find out. So, is this your secret bootlegging facility or what? - Come on! - What? No! What are you talking about? This is Sweet Pete's legit business. It's for old merchandise that never got sold. - Old merchandise? - Yeah, like for example, - you remember Shrek body wash? - Uh... Exactly. No one does. It didn't sell. That's why Sweet Pete bought all the inventory, and melts it down for its useful parts. The guy has a real eye for business. I wish I could see what he sees. I'm sure there's corrective lenses or something you could get. Ow. What? So, he turns the toys into toy-lets. Wow! That's been staring at me for years, and I never pieced it together. Here we are! Hello! - Peter Pan? - Yup! Star of stage and screen, but you can call me Sweet Pete. - Oh, you look... - Old? Bald? Sad like a zoo gorilla? - What? No. Not like a zoo gorilla. - Don't worry. You can't say nothing to me I haven't heard already. Jimmy, please. Untie our guests. Chip and Dale! Wow! You mind if I walk while we talk? Not fitting into the old costume like I used to. Need to get my steps in. Hey! I've got one of those. We should link accounts and help motivate each other. Right. So, I'm guessing you two are here to talk about Monterey Jack. - Oh. Yeah, actually we are. - You know, I always liked Monty. It's a shame what happened. Too much cheese. Not enough bread. Listen, Mr. Sweet Pete... Mr. Pete. We'd be willing to pay whatever Monty owes you if you could give him a break? Just this once? Hmm. "Give him a break"? You know, I got my big break when I was just a kid. I got cast in the biggest movie in the world, as the boy who wouldn't grow up, Peter Pan. I'd never been so happy in my entire life. Then I got older, and they threw me away like I was nothing. This business can be so tough You said it. I was scared, desperate, and all alone. So, I decided to take the power back and make my own bootleg movie! I called it "Flying Bedroom Boy." And guess what? It worked! I made lots of money. So, I recruited other toons, to star in more movies and bang-a-rang, now I run my own bootleg movie studio, where I get to decide who's a star, and who gets thrown in the trash! And now, you two come poking around where you don't belong, asking questions about your missing friend. And I can't have that. So, how's this for a break? I'm thinking it's time for a Chip 'n Dale reboot. - Jimmy... - You, come with me. - Yup, we're dead. - Run! Go, go, go, go, go! - Just grab them already! - I'm trying! Come on! Ready? Jump! Ah! Hey! That's my personal bathroom. Look for a way out of here! - Hey! - Uh... No. - Come out here! - No. - Aha! There's only one way, Chip. - No! That's disgusting. Jimmy, I got them! It's our only chance. Live a little! Live a little? You seem excited about this! - Don't... No... Aw... - Come on, Chip, the water's fine! - Aw. Dang it! - Come on! No! O... okay. Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you Happy birth... No, no! I'm done. You better pray they don't make it out of there alive. - Whoa! No! No! - Whoa! Hold on! Watch out! - Hate this! Hate this! - Oh, God! - I should probably get this! - What? - It could be my agent, Dave Bolinari! - Oh, cool! Let me know what he says! Hello! What? Oh, yeah, spaghetti's fine! Love you too, Mom! My agent is so weird. Try to grab something! - Pull, pull, pull, pull, pull! - No! No! There! The paddle ball! Ready? Jump! - Whoa! - Whoa! Hold on! - Whoa! - Whoa! Dale? Hello? Dale? Oh, no. Dale? Come on, don't, uh, don't prank me like this. - I should've... - What's up? Not now, Dale. Dale! You're alive! But how? The name's Munk. Dale Munk. Ugh. Double-0 Dale, of course. Chip, you were crying. You really do love me! - What? No! I... You were crying! - Aw! - Can we... - Chippy, Chippy, I love you too! Don't make it about you. I was traumatized! - Aw. - Just leave it alone, okay? Okay, fine. Well, that whole day was a big waste! We didn't learn anything of value except for that Sweet Pete wears the same step tracker that I do. Wait, those step trackers, do they keep track of everywhere you go? Yeah, I know because I like to map my runs in the shape of a butt. I can't believe I'm saying this, but we need to go talk to Ellie. And then, I'm going home! Okay, but please just don't tell her about the butt thing. I can't promise that. Do you think she'll think it's funny, though? Thanks! So, if we could get a hold of Sweet Pete's step tracker, we could cross reference where he's been, with where we know he goes! Right! And whatever doesn't overlap has got to be his secret facility! Exactly! We get the step tracker, and we can trace it to find Monty. - Chip, you're a genius! - So, what's the plan? How are you guys gonna get Sweet Pete's step tracker? "You guys"? Hold on. We got you the info you needed. Now, it's up to you, the professional, to actually, you know, get the bad guy, - and save our friend Monty? - It's not as simple as that. We need warrants, we need probable cause, and I don't know if you guys noticed, but the captain doesn't really value my opinion too much. - What? He's crazy! - No, I really screwed up. Last year, when Peppa Pig went missing, I fell for a bogus tip, and made the whole squad raid Nickelodeon Junior Studios. And the toons fought back. Paw Patrol attacked Sergeant Henderson. The doctors say he'll never have kids. Huh, thank you for sharing that absolutely bonkers story. I think I have exactly what we need! Don't move. Ladies and gentlemen. Behold! The crime lab! What? This is crazy. Pretty sweet, right? All the disguises and gadgets we could ever need. Wait, is this like every episode of Rescue Rangers ever? - Yes, it is. - You've got them all. "Catteries Not Included." "Throw Mummy from the Train," "Dirty Rotten Diapers." Okay, so what's your favorite episode? Ooh, I... I can't pick one. That's too hard! Same. So good. I'm honestly surprised you kept all this stuff. I didn't think you cared about the show back then. What? Of course I did. No. Yeah, of course. What's this huge map with all the pins in it? Oh, that? It's actually very cool. Oh, no. Is this where all the victims are buried? You're messing with me again! It actually shows Rescue Rangers' ratings in every US market in 1991 which, as you may recall, was our most successful year. Hey, Ellie, didn't you say you were from Albany? Born and raised. Well, according to this map Rescue Rangers never aired in Albany. Yeah! My grandma, she used to tape all the episodes and send them to me. - Hmm. - Grandmas rule! Oh, come on, Chip! Look at all this cool stuff! Like this is the limited edition Rescue Rangers pog set! You know, this turned into a real collectible, because someone noticed that one of the clouds behind Monterey Jack looked exactly like... Oprah. Wow. So cool. I know, right? Unfortunately, I only have 11 of the 12. I'm missing the main one of all of us together. Ah, it's just old junk. Okay, guys. Sweet Pete goes to the Russian bathhouse every Wednesday. So, how are we gonna sneak you guys in there without being recognized by all those goons? - Wait. What if we did episode 45? - Forty-five? - That's a good idea. - No idea what you're referring to. And do you have any original ideas? Or are you just constantly recycling old scripts? Oh, come on! Episode 45! You dressed up like a rat to fool me. You don't remember? You said, "Rats what I'm talking about." It was hilarious! Oh... Nope, no clue. Ellie, if we do this, we could really use your help. Um. I don't know. I shouldn't even be here. Please! I need you, Ellie! Help find me! - Okay, but just this once. - Oh, thanks, love! Throw another shrimp on the barbie! - Stop. - No, I know, that's why I stopped, yeah? Okay, guys, remember, you're plumbers here to fix a leaky pipe. Roger that. This thing working? It's working. I'd say we have about an hour before anyone notices this van is missing, so shake a tail. I can't believe we're doing this. Please, just don't do your bad New York accent. Chip, I hear you, but it's an unreasonable ask. Yo! We're here to clean the pipes, or did you forget about it? Go Yanks! And hot dogs, bagels, and pizza! Wow. I am honestly amazed that that worked. Me too! That accent actually got me fired from Law and Order. - Ellie, we're in. - Good. Now, keep a low profile, and go find Sweet Pete's locker. Hey, you two! This water fountain good? - Uh... - Uh... Are the pipes clean to drink from? - Oh, um... - Hey! They're cleaner than Broadway, baby. - I'm walking here. - Good. Thank you. Hmm? Nice work. You need to stay up on those pipes, out of sight. Yup! On it. Oh, yeah! That feels great, man. - Gross! - Nope. Come on. I get the kids on the weekends, but it's not the same. Whoa. It's him. There it is. Okay, not great. Hey, I know you. - Oh, no. - We're cooked. You're the Rescue Rangers. - I am huge fan boy! - Oh, cool. Don't you just hate awkward silences? Well, to be honest, it wasn't awkward until you said that, Jimmy, and now it is, so great job. - I guess that's true. - Guys, come on! -Step right up and come on in -You are recognizing? -Here's where the fun begins -Yes? Wait for it. No way! Is this a remix of the Disney Afternoon theme song? - You made this? - You are knowing it, brother! Now you do a rap on it? Yes? Uh-oh, I don't know! Give me one second with Dale here, bro. - First off, stop encouraging this guy. - Totally. - Second, we are not rapping. - Right. There is nothing more pathetic than an old cartoon character - trying to seem cool again by rapping! - Chip, I hear you, but I don't think we have much of a choice! Oh, there's a choice. When it comes to rapping, there's always a choice. Actually, can you just hold that thought for one second? - Here I go! - Oh, geez! My name is Dale... Uh... I'm about to kick it - Oh, no. - And I'm in hell. Oh, wow, hold on. I need to film this! I'll distract him. You get that step tracker. - It won't work. It's too risky. - Well, the biggest risk is not taking any risk at all. Uh! My name is Dale, I don't eat whale Why would you say, that I eat whale I don't eat whale Once you rhyme Dale with whale, you can't think of anything else. - Just devour him! Make it stop! - Not me, no, I would just eat the tail Hmm. I would never in a million years Eat whale First of all, they're endangered -So, you gotta take care of the whale -Macadamias. And where there's nuts, - there's oil. - Don't want PETA on your tail But if I did eat whale It wouldn't be stale - Aha. - Oh, man, I'm killing this! - And what are you doing? - Oh, I was a just, uh... Aye, yo, Chip! Take the mic! Uh... For Monty. Well, my name is Chip, I'm not a whale And now I'm doing it, great. A zubi-zong, zubi, zubi, zubi, dong, dong - Yo ink. - Zubi, dong, dong, dong -'Cause he's Chip -He's Dale And we'll never fail! 'Cause neither of us Will ever eat whale -No, never -Ever -Never -Ever -Never eat whale -Eat whale Okay, what? How did you know what I was gonna say? How did you know what I was gonna say? It was like, - professional. - Professional. - Same time! - Same time! - Jinx! - Jinx! - You owe me a non-brand specific cola! - You owe me a non-brand specific cola! - What? That was crazy! - What? That was crazy! - Somebody call Guinness book! - Somebody call Guinness book! - This is incredible! - This is blowing my mind! We lost it. Boom, boom. It's DJ Herzogenaurach with the Disney Afternoon remix! Hey, this was really fun, but we actually got to get going! Ooh, they were very bad at rapping. Oh, hey, Bob! You are never going to believe who I just met. Oh, man, Ellie, you should have seen us! - That was incredible! - Right? We were just like real detectives! And that match trick you did with the oil? Genius! Yeah, but your bad rapping was the perfect distraction. So good! Thanks. I totally thought we were busted. But then you just fully went for it! - And then I rapped. What a rush! - You were crazy! Okay, we are all set here. Just plug that step tracker - into the computer. - On it! Oh, San Pedro docks! Yes, we got him! I can't believe it. We might actually get Monty back. - We're gonna be heroes. - I gotta thank you for making me do this. - I mean, this feels... I feel... good. - Me too! We were always better together. Location confirmed. We're sending SWAT now by chopper. - Meet us there. - Yes, sir. Here, Captain. I ought to suspend you for going behind my back, Steckler. And I hope we don't get attacked by the Rugrats this time. Ready the battering rams! Let's go! Move! Move! Move! - Clear! - Clear! Clear! - Where do you think he is? - I have no idea. Sir! I think I found something. Careful. Don't touch anything. Flounder? Sneezy? They're all here. Whoa. Garfield's little body can't take muscles like that. We found 'em. This looks like the machine I had my CG work done on. Except, way more violent-looking. It's still warm. Must have just missed him. Yeah, this place is creepy. I'm gonna see if I can't find a light switch. Wait. No, no, no, no, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't! - See? Nothing to worry about! - Heh. I guess you're right. Uh. That's not good. - Dude! What did you do? - I didn't mean to, I just... I put my leg back, my toe... - Chip! - Why is it on the floor? Dale! - Ah, no! Watch out! - Get out of there! No, no, no, no, no! Help! Get us out of here! The machine is gonna try and surgically re-edit you, so, try to avoid that. Goodbye, Ellie! Always remember me! If we don't make it out of here alive, let Millie live with you, and sleep on your bed, and eat your food, and don't be afraid to really scratch that butt! Are we about to get waffle fried? No, I think it's... Scanning them, and rendering what they'll look like in different animation styles. Okay. That was nothing. You know, this might be easier than... Dale! - Hey! Hey! - Hold on! - Pull harder! - Why... won't... you... stretch? This body is meant to be looked at, not touched! What are you doing? Whoa! - Thank you. - Come on! Whoa. - It's like episode 121! - "Mission Chipossible!" - You're right. - Wait, you remember? I guess a couple things are coming back to me. Then let's do it. How different could it be? - Very different! It can be very different. - Ready? Jump! Duck! Pancake. Launch me! - Heads-up! - Got you! Slide! - You okay? Are you in one piece? - Yeah, I think so. But you're not. Huh? I'm sure they're fine. - You got a Snoopy ear! - Get it off! Get it off! The door! Let's get out of here! What the... You guys okay? Look at all these parts. Oh, no. - Monty's mustache. - No! He's been bootlegged! Hey, Steckler. Nice work, today. I didn't think you had it in you. Thank you, sir. Over here. One question! Over here! 3D In Your Face News. With this factory shut down, how does it feel to have made the city safer for toons? All right, come on. Leave them alone. No questions. Come on, guys, let's get out of here. Hey, Chip, why the Snoopy ear? Captain Putty! Captain Putty! Black and White News. Why is there a wad of chewing gum on your back? Oh, come on! Gross. Now, that's just gonna be a part of me forever. Well, this is a mess. We should probably skip down for a while, huh, boss? We're not going anywhere without those chipmunks. - I still want my reboot. - Should we try to follow them? Nah, let 'em go. I have my own special way of tracking people. - Are we sure that every room was checked? - Yeah. Positive. You said bootlegging takes 48 hours. We made it before then. - I know. It usually does. - And that coffee was still warm. It's like they knew we were coming. Look, I know you guys are sad about Monty, but you should still feel really good about what you did back there. - You guys are heroes. - We are not heroes. Monty's gone. I was so excited to see his big, dopey face. I'm telling you, we're missing something. I can feel it, Dale. Hey, just wanna remind you guys, I'll be at Fan Con this afternoon, signing autographs. So, get those nuts ready! - Yeah... - What is wrong with you? What? It's my job. It's a choice. I'm getting some coffee. Wh... Come on! I have to stay connected to the fans! There are no fans. It's for you. It's always for you, to feed your selfish ego. I thought you had changed, but you haven't changed since Double-0 Dale! Wait, so you are still mad about Double-0 Dale? I thought everything was artichokie. You left, Dale. You left me high and dry. After everything we'd been through, everything I did for you! - So, we're not artichokie? - No artichokie! Nothing's ever been artichokie. Okay? I'm alone. I sell insurance. My only friend is a dog! Okay, but then why did you say it was artichokie? I mean, when someone tells me something's artichokie, I believe it's artichokie. Stop saying artichokie! What is it, man? Oh, uh, if you could just scooch a bit, from the coffee? Yes, yes, of course. Sorry. See? This is why I didn't wanna see you anymore. Sure, my life is lonely, but at least I didn't feel like this! Oh, yeah? Well, you're the same too! Chip's always in charge! Chip's always right! It's Chip's way or the highway! You know what? Here. I've been holding on to this for some stupid reason. Now, your collection is complete. What? You kept this? You know the crazy thing is, way back then... I didn't even wanna do Double-0 Dale. - What? - It's gonna sound stupid, but... ...I think I just wanted you to tell me you needed me. That I wasn't just some pathetic chipmunk you found eating alone at school. You know, I wanted this pog for some silly reason, but now I don't. - Here, now your collection's complete. - What? Don't give me that! That's the exact same thing I just said to you. What? No, it's not. I said, "silly reason." - You said, "stupid reason." - Well, I don't want it. - Neither do I! - Good! - I'm putting it on the ground. - Great! - Yeah. - Cool. - I know. - Neat! It is neat. Thanks. Do you smell that? I'm definitely not falling for one of your dumb fart jokes right now. No! No, no! Smell! This whole place, it smells like... - almond butter and gasoline. - Almond butter and gasoline. But that's the Rescue Rangers cologne. This way. It's coming from in here. Why would Putty's office smell like that? Dale, we need to leave, now. What's going on? Why are we running away? I'm not sure, but you and your big red nose are onto something. Monty was literally the only person - to ever use that disgusting cologne. - Actually, I heard it's still used in the Latvia to strip paint, but of course, we never see a dime of that. That's not the point. Putty's office stunk of it, which means someone had direct contact with Monty. - Oh, I knew Putty was dirty! - Oh, you're just saying that 'cause it's always the police captain in our episodes. Putty's too obvious! Think, Dale! - Ellie? - Something has been off about her the whole time! Claiming to be a huge fan just to butter us up. She couldn't even name her favorite episode. - 'Cause she loves them all. - No! 'Cause she's never seen any episodes! "Her grandmother taped the show for her." Get real! Grandparents are terrible at electronics. That's their whole thing! Aha! Speak of the devil! Are you crazy? Don't pick that up! We don't know who we can trust. We need outside help, like the governor, the CIA, the FBI. I know someone who might be able to help. You got a Snoopy ear! Yes, Ugly Sonic, his ear is hilarious, but do you have a contact at the FBI? Because we have some highly dangerous and classified information for them. Yeah, of course. I know tons of people at the FBI. - I'm making a TV show with them. - Look, we really need your help, but we don't have a lot of time. Oh, you want me to go fast? That's Sonic's thing. Ugly Sonic goes slow, baby. - So, you're not gonna help us? - No, I'm not. Ugh! You don't have a show with the FBI. I knew it! I knew it! I wasn't finished. - Dale, we need to go. - I'll run it by my producer later - when I see him at the Chateau. - Oh, no. - Quick, we'll lose them in the crowd. - One day, you'll see, Dale. You'll turn on your television and all will be revealed. - No, it won't. - Yes, it will! Move! Out of the way! Move it, nerds! You know, originally, it was called Aunt Man, A-U-N-T, and my superpower was being really charming to aunts. That's great, isn't it? - Yeah, they changed it... - Whoa! Coming through. Love your work! - Whoa! - Watch out! - Okay. Nice horsey, nice horsey. - Whoa! Step aside. Move. - There they are. - Well, go get them. - Gotcha! - Oh, what? - Peter, is that really you? You got old. - Yeah, death is coming for us all, kid. - How do they know we're here? - I'm guessing your social media post at the police station. Ah! Oops. - Yeah, that's my bad. - Hey, there's something down there. There's nothing down there, you boob. You walk around with no pants long enough, and you start to notice every breeze. Gotcha! Huh? We need a disguise or something. In here. Grab the first thing you can. Uh... What? It's the Rescue Rangers! - Oh, my gosh! I am your biggest fan! - Oh, my God. Cook-a-rook-a-roo! Think happy little thoughts. Definitely pulled something. You keep going, I'll catch up. Hey, give me that! Ugh! It's diet! Up here. Hey! By the axe of Ucarga, you will submit to me! What are you doing? I got you! What are you looking at? - Honestly, your weird dead eyes. - They are weird. Super weird. So funny. Well, I'll be. Chip and Dale together again Never thought I'd see the day. Get back here! Wow. - Yo, man, it's you! - Baloo. Nice to meet you. No way! Can I touch your face? I mean, what is going on? Quick, the elevator. Oh, no! I command thee to halt! You want a piece of me? Be my guest. Berserker! Ah, ah, ah! Hello, 911? I have a rather unruly visitor here. There's the exit. Go, Dale. Go! Come on, Chip! Quick! Hide up here! Chip? Chip, where are you? Where are you, buddy? No. No, no, no, no, no, no! Hey, Steckler. I just got a tip. I think your little chipmunk friends - are in trouble. - I know, sir. - I'm heading to the Convention Center now. - No, it's worse than that. Come on. We gotta move fast before it's too late. You're gonna arrest me while Jack Skellington's been embezzling from his own charity for years? Everyone knows it! Where's Dale? He'll be here. Keep your pants on. - I don't wear pants. - Yeah, I noticed. It's not something to brag about. What do you want? I want you to stop messing with my business. You exposed everything, now I have to move all this stuff, and start over. It's super annoying. You should have just let me bootleg you when you came to my office. Could have saved us both a ton of headaches. Ah! Besides, I was always more of an Alvin and the Chipmunks person. You monster. Freeze, Sweet Pete. Nah. How about you freeze? Drop it, Steckler. - What? Captain Putty? - Dale was right. - How cliché. - I know. It is a bit unoriginal, right? Sweet Pete, remember when you first approached me to turn bad, be a bad guy, work with you, and I was like, "Come on! That's too predictable." Yeah. And what did I say? - "If it ain't broke..." - "If it ain't broke..." - How could you? - I know, I know. It's terrible. I am so ashamed. But I had no choice. My mother needed an operation. See, she got injured playing a game of Operation. She got too close to the sides and, uh... ...she got buzzed really bad. Oh, I'm sorry. I couldn't do it any longer. Money! I'm a greedy little Smurf - who did it for the money. - Hilarious. Yeah, but I had you going there for a second, didn't I? "Hello, I think I just saw Peppa Pig heading into Nickelodeon Jr." It was you? You gave the fake tip. You derailed the whole investigation and... and worst of all, you made me doubt myself. Oh, come on. Don't be so fragile. Oh, wow, wow, oh, wow! Keep it together, Dale. Come on. It's Ellie. Wait, no, Ellie could be bad. But she also could be good. Oh, my brain hurts. I wish Chip was here. He'd know what to do. Uh... - Hello? - Hey. You okay? Uh, yeah, totally fine. Why do you ask? You don't have to worry, Dale. I know how to get Chip back. I'm down at the bootlegging facility. Meet me here. And come alone. Well, that sounds super shady and not safe at all. I know. But you have to trust me. And, Dale, "When You Fish Upon A Star," that's my favorite episode. Oh. Kind of a deep cut. Why is that your favorite? Hello? Huh. I mean, "When You Fish Upon A Star" is a good episode, but I wouldn't call it great. Why did you tell Dale to come? You should have protected him. I gave him a secret message. A code. Dale forgets his own phone number. How is he gonna break a code? Listen up, you rejects from a science lab. I didn't think of this extraordinarily brilliant plan, only to have - you idiots wreck the wrong ship. - Still holds up. It's a great show. - A ship full of worthless junk! - Ah, no! Focus, Dale. Come on. - Ellie is sending a message, but what? - ...you know? Your little friends would never dream of leaving you hanging here. - Would they? - All right. Think, Dale, think. Gadget is stuck in a lantern. Lanterns provide light by using fire. Fire is really cool, but also really dangerous. Someone is in a dangerous situation. Oh, like that time I dropped a bowling ball on my toe. Ellie has ten toes and she probably likes Thai food. Ellie is tied up and in danger, and Chip is with her. It was Putty working with Sweet Pete the whole time. I cracked it. I'm coming, guys. Come on. Start, start, start, start! No. No, no, no. Huh. Honey, someone's doing a cool pose in the driveway. Excuse me. Dale, old chum. The sight of you lights my heart aglow. Rangers, I need your help. We love you, bud, but we just can't invest in any more of your independent movies. What... No, I'm not here for that. I'm here for something very important. Although that script was pretty good. Did you even read it? Chip, I wanna do something extra special for you. How would you feel about playing your old character, but with feet for ears, and a dog snout where your tail should be? Okay, honest feedback, that sounds terrible. You're gonna like the way you look. - I guarantee it. - You'll never get away with this. The Men's Wearhouse reference? Yeah, I think I will. Okay, let's make some changes. Cook-a-rook-a-roo! Whoo-hoo-hoo! Whee! This is awesome! I'm amazed this thing actually flies. And you know how to fly it. Yeah. I guess my character from the old show, and my character in real life are basically exactly the same. Yeah, I guess so. Zipper, how are the kids? Splendid. I mean, sure, being a stay-at-home dad has its challenges, but it's the most rewarding job I could ever ask for and it just... Whoa! It's actually my agent. Sorry, can you hold on for a second? Wow! Dave Bolinari. Haven't heard from you in a while. Did you not get my last seven years of messages? Oh, Daley, brother, so sorry. Look, I got a new assistant, and then we were off for the holidays. Anyways, I'm watching the news. You're the talk of the town. We've got heat. We've got offers. I'm thinking book deal. I'm thinking reboot. Hey, actually, can I call you back? I can't talk now. What? But, Dale, you gotta get your priorities straight, dawg. You know what? I think for the first time in my life, I am getting my priorities straight. Friends are more important than business. - Dale, brother. - Good for you, Dale. Probably shouldn't have thrown your phone, though. Nope. Immediately regretted it. Well, it was a good run. - No, it wasn't. Who am I kidding? - Okay, let's see. Dog snout right on the butt. It's hilarious. Chip doesn't know what he's talking about. Stop him, Captain! You're better than this. No, I'm not. Ah, there it is. The foreboding fortress on the horizon. - Oh, I love it when you talk fancy, honey. - Thank you, my love. - Aw. - Looks like the only way in - is through that exhaust pipe. - Okay, good. Try to line me up with it. - Are you sure you wanna do this, Dale? - As sure as I've ever been. But you're, like, known for constantly making terrible decisions. - I know, right? - Rescue Rangers, away. Huh. At least that's gone. Whoo! Hold on, Chippy! Uh-oh. - No! No, no, no, no. Come on! - Hey, hey. Fix that. - You should fix it. - Oh, yeah. Thanks for the input, genius. - Ellie. - Dale. Hey, are you okay? Where's Chip? - He's still in the machine. - Over here. - Chip, you're okay. - Yeah. You came for us. I never doubted you, buddy. - See? He understood the clue. - Of course, it was obvious. In "When You Fish Upon a Star," Gadget was double-crossed. Just like us. Right. Totally. You had a completely different take, didn't you? - Yes, mine involved Thai food. - Stop! Or I'll erase him right here. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Okay. - Wait. - Let's talk about this. - Listen, I get how you feel. Things didn't work out the way you wanted, right? You had big hopes and dreams and, well... ...then the world just sort of breaks your heart. And it feels like the only emotions you have left are anger and loneliness. But you're not alone. None of us are. Wow. It's true. You two really are the worst actors in Hollywood. Hey! What the... No! What the... What is going on with this thing? No, no, no. No! That was not cool. - Hey, are you okay? - I think so. - Dale, are you hurt? - No, I'm good. Huh? Uh-oh. Hey! Oh. Oh. Ugh! And it smells too. Stupid glass. Okay, I'm out. - Putty, he's getting away. - I'm on it. Meow. - Huh? - I'm gonna wreck stuff. Run! Hey, up here. You fools! - Whoa! - Whoa! Uh... - Where are we? - Boh Barba. Pooj, The Fat Honey Bear? Ugh. Keep going! Two words. Chipmunk soup. I guess they were making the bootleg movies here - the whole time. - What the... - Not overseas. - Boy! Dorf! Ay, pechanga! Captain? It's all over. Just give yourself up. Hello? Whoa! Whoa! Oopsie daisy. Yo ink, yo ink. Heads-up. Oh, that actually made me dizzy. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Watch out. Hey, get outta the way, you little yahoos! Move it! You're messing things up here. Coming through! Grab on. Whoa! Yoo-hoo! So close. Okay. You know, I'm... Ah, it's stuck to my face like Silly Putty. Remember that stuff? Let's finish this. Boing! Poor, sweet, little Ellie. You never should've been a cop in the first place. Any last words? What? I can't hear you. No? Okay. Bye, bye, you're dead. Hey, Putty. Don't be so fragile. - No! - There's nowhere to go. We're trapped. I'm gonna find you! Come out, come out, wherever you are. This is bad. Come on. Use that big old brain of yours, Chip, think. That's it. - Episode 325. - Episode 325. - Here. It worked on Fat Cat. Hit me. - No. This time you hit me. - Are you sure? - Yeah. Come on. - Get right under it. Now, do it. - Okay, here I go. Ow! I can't believe we used to do this to you every week. Come on, where are they? Oh, come on, Harold. It's the middle of the night. - Just ignore it. - We've been through this, Eileen. It's my job. Do not ruffle me right now. - It didn't work. You gotta hit me again. - All right. Ow! There you are. Enough playing around. My turn. Here, give it a good whack. Oh! Okay. Things are getting weird. This isn't good. Huh? Birds. Come here! Go! Go! Go! What the... Almost there. Goodbye, Chip 'n Dale. Huh? This is the FBI. - We've got you surrounded. - Yeah. Ugly Sonic! Take that! - Go, go, go, go. Come on, Dale. Hit it. - Got it! Huh? - Yeah! - Yes! See! I told you I had a show, Dale. Ow! Stupid teeth, I think I just bit my tongue. Whoo! We're the smartest chipmunks on the planet. - You thought you could beat us? - Ha! Don't you know who we are? -Ch... Ch... Ch... Chip 'n Dale -Ch...

Get down on the ground! - All right, all right, Calm down. Dale? D... Dale, come on. Don't mess with me. Come on. Not this time, man. I know you're just pranking me. I'm not falling for this twice. Come on. Dale? You... you know, the morning I met you, when we were just kids at the cafeteria... I never told you this, but I begged my mom to let me stay home from school because I didn't have any friends. You're a great kid, Chip. Remember, the biggest risk is not taking any risk at all. You'll find a friend. I promise. I was so scared and alone. And I was lost. Just like you, Dale. And I needed you more than you needed me. Hey. Mind if I sit? All these years, I... I let you feel like you were second banana because I wanted to feel like first banana. I was nothing without you. So that night when... In the trailer when... when you told me about Double-0 Dale, I... I just should have told you that. I shouldn't have treated you that way. I'm sorry, Dale. - Really? - Dale! - But how'd you... - This thing's too special to throw away. - Ow! That pog smashed my nose. - That worked out well. - You saved my life. - Eh. You'd do the same for me. Wait. Hold on a second. If they were filming the bootleg movies here, you don't think... - Monty! - Monty! - Whoa. Okay, okay. Slow down. - Do you see him? Monty? I don't see him. Monty? - Mates! - Oh, Monty! - We thought we lost you. - Oh, thank goodness. - You never gave up on me. - Of course not. - We'd never give up on friends. - Oh, what did they do to you? Ah, Chipper. They Dumbo'd me. Don't worry. I've got a guy that'll fix those ears, no problem. Oh, thank you, Dale. - No way. Is that... - Wow, those ears are huge. Gadget, Zipper. I must be dreaming. Can you believe it? All the Rescue Rangers together. It has been a long time. It's really good to see you guys. - It is wonderful to see you all. - Wow, look at what you guys did. You're under arrest, you low-rent Gumby. He's all yours, boys. Nice work on this case. The FBI could use someone like you. Thanks. But I think I'd like to start my own detective agency. Hey, Ellie, get over here. Gang. I'd like you to meet our dear friend, Ellie. None of this would have been possible without her. - As it turns out, she's a... - Fan. I am a huge fan. Well, nice to meet you. - Hello. - Greetings. You know, Dale, I'm sorry it took all this to get us back together. Oh, Chip. Come here. Crikey. I'd cry if they didn't erase me tear ducts. To err is human, to forgive, divine. Sometimes, I can't tell what you guys like more. Eating nuts or driving us nuts. I've always wanted to do one of these laughs with you guys. - How long does it last? - The worse the joke, the longer the laugh. So, Chip. Does this mean we are officially friends again? Heh. Sure. I guess some things are worth rebooting. You said it. You wanna do a Rescue Rangers reboot. No, I didn't. That is not what I meant. I mean, maybe. I'd have to see the script first. Oh, yes. That's a yes. Hey, do you think we can get, - like, a pop star to do the theme song? - Yeah, right. Like a super serious version, even though everyone just wants to hear the original. Yes!
