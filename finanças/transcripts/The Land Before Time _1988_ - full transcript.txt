NARRATOR: Once upon this same Earth, beneath this same Sun, long before you... Before the ape and the elephant as well, before the wolf, the bison, the whale, before the mammoth and the mastodon in the time of the dinosaurs. Come on! NARRATOR: Now the dinosaurs were of two kinds. Some had flat teeth and ate the leaves of trees, and some had sharp teeth for eating meat, and they preyed upon the Leaf Eaters. Then it happened that the leaves began to die. The mighty beasts, who appeared to rule the Earth, were ruled, in truth, by the leaf. Desperate for food, some of the dinosaur herds struck out toward the west, searching for the Great Valley, a land still lush and green. It was a journey toward life. It was a march of many dangers. Sharpteeth stalked the herds, waiting to seize any who strayed. The Leaf Eaters stopped only to hatch their young. Ha. Aah. (GIGGLING) (GROWLING) (LAUGHING) Mama. Hmm. Mmm. (GIGGLING) Mmm. Mmm. (GIGGLING) (GROWLING) (GROWLING) (SQUEALING) (GIGGLING) (GROWLING) NARRATOR: Some of the young seemed born without fear. (THUNDER CRACKING) (SQUEALING) NARRATOR: Yet... (SNARLING) Even hatching could be dangerous. (YELPING) (CHITTERING) (SNIFFING) One herd had only a single baby, their last hope for the future. (LAUGHING) And they called him "Littlefoot." MOTHER: Here I am. Aw. (LAUGHING) Don't be frightened. Come out. (CHATTERING) Mmm. (GASPS) (MOTHER LAUGHING) NARRATOR: All that remained of his herd was his mother, grandmother, and his grandfather. He knew them by sight, by scent, and by their love. He knew they would be together always. Now, you be careful, my Littlefoot. Ahh. (CHUCKLING) Aah. MOTHER: Beautiful Littlefoot. Mother, is this all there is to eat? Oh, I'm sorry, my dear. The land has been changing. That is why we must walk as far as we can each day, until we reach the Great Valley. Littlefoot, quickly, come here. Look, up there. A tree star. It is very special. (GIGGLING) A tree star. MOTHER: It is very special. It'll help you grow strong. Where we are going, there are so many of these leaves. Come along. (CHUCKLING) The Great Valley is filled with green food like this, more than you could ever eat, and more fresh, cool water than you could ever drink. It's a wonderful, beautiful place, where we can live happily with many more of our own kind. Gee, when will we get there? MOTHER: The bright circle must pass over us many times, and we must follow it each day to where it touches the ground. Have you ever seen the Great Valley? No. Well, how do you know it's really there? Some things you see with your eyes, others you see with your heart. (SIGHING) I don't understand, Mother. (CHUCKLING) You will, my son. You will. (GIGGLING) MOTHER: Littlefoot, don't you wander too far. (HONKING) Hey! (LITTLEFOOT LAUGHING) CERA: What are you laughing at? (GASPS) (HONKING) (GROWLING) (SNARLING) MOTHER: Littlefoot. Come, Cera. Three-horns never play with Longnecks. (BLOWING RASPBERRY) MOTHER: Littlefoot. (GROWLING) Three-horns never play with Longnecks. Longneck? Hmm. Mother, what's a Longneck? Why, that's what we are, dear. Oh. Well, why can't I play with that Three-horn? We were having fun. MOTHER: Well, we all keep to our own kind. The Three-horns, the Spiketails, the Swimmers, the Flyers. We never do anything together. LITTLEFOOT: Why? MOTHER: Well, because we're different. It's always been that way. LITTLEFOOT: Well, why? (MOTHER CHUCKLING) Oh, don't worry so much. When we reach the Great Valley, there will be many, many Longnecks for you to play with. (LITTLEFOOT SIGHING) I wish we were there now. MOTHER: Well, it's a long way yet, past the great rock that looks like a Longneck, and past the mountains that burn. Still a long way, but we'll get there. (CROAKING) (LITTLEFOOT GASPS) (CROAKING) LITTLEFOOT: Hey, hopper, come back! (CROAKING) Hey. You again? Go away! That's my hopper. I... I saw him first. Well, he's in my pond. (CROAKING) (CROAKING) (CROAKING) (CROAKING) (CROAKING) (GIGGLING) (LAUGHING) (CROAKING) LITTLEFOOT: Over here. CERA: Hey, this is fun. (LAUGHING) (HEAVY FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) (LAUGHING CONTINUES) (GASPS) (LITTLEFOOT GASPS) CERA: Sharptooth! Help! Mother! Help! (SNARLING) (GROWLING) (PANTING) (SNIFFING) (GROWLING) Go. This way. Mm-mmm. LITTLEFOOT: Come back. You're going the wrong way! (CERA SCREAMING) Whoa! (GASPS) (GROWLING) (GRUNTING) (CERA SCREAMING) (GROWLING) (SCREAMING) (GROWLING) (GROWLING) Mother? Run! Run! Look out! (SCREAMING) (RUMBLING) (GASPS) (SCREECHING) (GASPS) (GRUNTING) BOTH: Help! (GROWLING) LITTLEFOOT: Mother! (GROWLING) (SCREAMING) (SCREAMING) (ROARING) Daddy! (SCREAMING) NARRATOR: In this time of the clash of continents, a great earthquake split the land. Herds were divided, families were cut in two. Littlefoot was separated from his grandparents. DADDY TOPPS: Cera! CERA: Mama! Daddy! NARRATOR: Cera was on one side of the divide, her parents were on the other. LITTLEFOOT: Mother! Mother! (GRUNTING) Mother, where are you? Oh. Mother! Mother? Oh. Please get up. I'm not sure I can, Littlefoot. LITTLEFOOT: Yes, you can. Get up. Dear, sweet Littlefoot, do you remember the way to the Great Valley? I guess so, but why do I have to know? You're going to be with me. MOTHER: I'll be with you, even if you can't see me. LITTLEFOOT: What do you mean if I can't see you? I can always see you. MOTHER: Littlefoot, let your heart guide you. It whispers. So, listen closely. LITTLEFOOT: Mother? Mother? (SNIFFLING) (GASPS) Mmm. Mmmmm. Hey! (SNIFFING) What's going on here? (LITTLEFOOT SOBBING) What's your problem? You're not hurt. It's not fair. She should have known better. That was a Sharptooth. It's all her fault. All whose fault? Mother's. Oh... I see. I see. Why did I wander so far from home? ROOTER: Oh, it's not your fault. It's not your mother's fault. Now, you pay attention to old Rooter. Yeah, but... It is nobody's fault. The great circle of life has begun, but, you see, not all of us arrive together at the end. What'll I do? I miss her so much. ROOTER: And you'll always miss her, but she'll always be with you as long as you remember the things she taught you. In a way, you'll never be apart, for you are still a part of each other. My tummy hurts. Well, that, too, will go in time, little fella. Only in time. (PEEPING) (PEEPING) (PEEPING) (ALL PEEPING) (PEEPING) (ALL PEEPING) NARRATOR: At first, Littlefoot could only think about his mother. He hardly noticed his hunger and forgot about the Great Valley and that he must somehow reach it. (PEEPING) (PEEPING) (PEEPING SADLY) MOTHER: Littlefoot. (SNIFFLING) Littlefoot. Dear Littlefoot, do you remember the way to the Great Valley? Follow the bright circle past the great rock that looks like a Longneck and past the mountains that burn. I'll be in your heart, Littlefoot. Let your heart guide you. (GASPS) Mother. Mother! (GIGGLING) Mother! (LAUGHING) It's you! Wait, Mother! Wait! NARRATOR: Then Littlefoot knew for certain that he was alone, and that though the Great Valley was far away and the journey there was perilous, he would have to find his way. Or the chain of life would be broken. LITTLEFOOT: Cera! Cera, hello. What do you want? (LAUGHING) Nothing. Where are you going? I'm going to find my own kind. They're on the other side. Well, I've looked all over here. You can't climb up the other side. Maybe you can't. (GRUNTING) Wait! I'm going to the Great Valley. We could...uh... Help each other. A Three-horn... (GRUNTING) Does not need help from a Longneck. (GASPS) (SCREAMING) Well, at least we wouldn't be alone. Well, when I find my sisters, I won't be alone, so go away. Three-horns can be very dangerous. And they only talk with other Three-horns, and they only travel with other Three-horns. Hello. I said hello. What is your name? (GASPS) Maybe you cannot talk yet. Huh? Huh? Don't you know anything? Longnecks don't talk to, uh, whatever you are. Me? I'm a Longneck, too. See? And I have a long tail like you. (STRAINING) (PANTING) All right. I'm not a Longneck. I'm a Bigmouth, but I am all alone. I am. (SNIFFLING) I lost my family in the big earthshake. Um...you want to go with me? Yeah! Oh. Oh, yes! Yes, yes! I do, I do! (LAUGHING) All right. Come on. (CLEARING THROAT) But you have to keep up. I will keep up. I will. (DUCKY HUMMING) Where are we going? To the Great Valley. I'm not gonna stop until I find my grandparents. Uh, do you think my family went to the Great Valley, too? Huh? Hmm. Maybe. My mother said it's where all the herds were going. Oh, I hope. I hope. I hope. (CLEARING THROAT) My name's Littlefoot. Mine is Ducky. Yep, that is what it is. Yup, yup, yup. (DUCKY HUMMING) Don't step on a crack, or you'll fall and break your back. (LAUGHING) (STOMACHS GROWLING) (CHUCKLING) My stomach is talking. Mine, too. Hmm. I wonder what this tastes like. (SCREAMING) (GASPS) The tree is talking. No, it isn't. You should not eat talking trees. Nope, nope, nope. (BURBLING) Oooh! (SCREAMING) (GIGGLING) (SCREAMING) (ALL SCREAMING) Who are you? Huh? (STAMMERING) My name Petrie. (LAUGHING) Petrie, huh? Funny name. Uh, I... I flied? No. You falled. I falled? Ohh! You cannot fly? But how did you get way up there? I climb. But you're a Flyer, not a faller. Hard thing to fly. I guess it is. We can't do it. Nope, we cannot do that all right. (LAUGHING) (GASPS) (GRUNTING) (SCREAMING) (RUMBLING) (CHUCKLING) (GRUNTING) (GRUNTING) (SCREAMING) (GROWLING) (DUCKY HUMMING) Shh! Quiet. (GROWLING) (WHISPERING) Stay low. (GROWLING) (PETRIE SHUDDERING) Ow! Hey! Petrie! Get off! You got nice flat head, Flat Head. My name is not Flat Head. My name is Littlefoot. Littlefoot? Hmm. Are you just going to stay up there? Yes. Well, you can't. Whoa! You're tearing my tree star. It is very special. Very. His mother gave it to him. She did. Ooh! Mother present very important. Oh, yes. I keep safes. Don't let nobodies touch. Yep, Petrie, you keep it safe. Yup, yup, yup. Nope, nope, nope. I'm not a carrier. Get off! You're a Flyer. Now start flying. (STAMMERING) But... (SCREAMING) DUCKY: Open your wings, Petrie! Open! Open! No, no! No can do this! You can fly! Now open your skinny wings! Petrie, higher! Higher like a Flyer! Danger! Where, Petrie? (STAMMERING) There! Ahead! ALL: Whoa! (SCREAMING) Cera! It's you! What happened? Why are you so frightened? Frightened? Me? (LAUGHING) Why are you so frightened? We're not frightened. Are we? DUCKY: Nope, nope. Well, you should be. I could be with the other Three-horns, but I chose to come back to warn you. I met the Sharptooth! (GASPS) Sharptooth! Ooh! Come on, Cera, Sharptooth is dead. He fell down into the big underground. And that's where he met me. Oh! Dear, brave Cera. Dear, brave Cera. Yes, I am brave. Sharptooth is dead! My father told me that Flat Heads had very small brains. I was all alone with him in the dark, (PETRIE SHUDDERING) just the Sharptooth and me. I could hear him breathing. (BREATHING LOUDLY) (SHUDDERING) I could see his one big ugly eye looking for me. (GASPS) (SNARLING) What did you do? Huh? Huh? I walked right up to him. I looked him straight in the eye and said... (ROARING) (SCREAMING) Whoa! (GRUNTING) (SNORING) LITTLEFOOT: Ducky! Hello. (SNORING) Hello? You should come out. You should. You are late. Yes, you are. Yup, yup, yup. (SNORING) Come out! You are all alone. Are you not scared? Huh? (YAWNING) We're going to the Great Valley. You could go with us. Yes, you can. Uh, you are a Spiketail, so we will call you "Spike." (LAUGHING) LITTLEFOOT: Ducky! (SNORING) NARRATOR: So, the five hungry dinosaurs set off for the Great Valley. There had never been such a herd before, a Longneck, a Three-horn, a Bigmouth, a Flyer, and a Spiketail, all together, all knowing that if they lost their way, they would starve or find themselves in Sharptooth's shadow. Hmm. Tree stars grow where there's lots of water. If we follow this water... (SNIFFING) Hmm. No green foods here, and I still hungry. I'm still hungry, too. (GASPS) (SNIFFING) Can you smell something? (SNIFFING) I... I... I smell... I smell... I smell... Hmm. Ducky. You smell me? (LAUGHING) I smell water. I smell... Tree stars! DUCKY: Oh, look! Green food! CERA: The Great Valley! I found it! Cera, stop it! I found it! (RUMBLING) CERA: Earthshake! LITTLEFOOT: We've got to get out of here! That way! Come on! Come on! Help! Spike, hurry up! LITTLEFOOT: Ducky, Spike, get out of there! (GASPS) (GASPS) CERA: They're eating our food! Look, look what they're doing! They're so greedy! What about me? I'm still hungry! (PETRIE SCOFFS) You hungry? I empty all the way to the top. Now we at the Great Valley and still got no green foods. Oh, we be hungry forevers. (MOANING) No, Petrie. Cera was wrong. This isn't the Great Valley. Oh, it is not a great anything. Nope, nope, nope. LITTLEFOOT: Well, we better go down and see if there's anything left. Petrie, do you think you could fly up there and... PETRIE: No, no! DUCKY: Petrie, do not feel sad. It is all right. Many things do not fly. Rocks, trees, sticks, Spike. (PETRIE SHUDDERING) (LITTLEFOOT GRUNTING) Waah! Hey! No! LITTLEFOOT: Ducky, push Petrie towards the branches. Ohh! LITTLEFOOT: All right, Spike, not too fast. Whoa! Okay. Hey, not too fast. Hey, not too fast! (ALL SCREAMING) (PETRIE SHUDDERING) (SCREAMING) (LAUGHING) You four look so ridiculous. (LAUGHING) (PETRIE GRUNTING) (LITTLEFOOT GASPS) (STRAINING) (PETRIE GROANING) LITTLEFOOT: Ducky, Petrie, come down here! We've got green food! DUCKY: Fly, Petrie! (SCREAMING) LITTLEFOOT: Fly, Petrie! Flap your wings! (CAWING) I flied? Come on, Cera. We've got green food. I can get my own green food. CERA: See? I can take care of myself. All by myself. And I'm not afraid to be alone! I know my way to go, and I'm not afraid of Sharptooth! I hope he doesn't eat any of you. Don't worry. There isn't any Sharptooth. (GASPS) (WHISPERING) Sharptooth! Spike. (CLEARING THROAT) Mmm. (SIGHING) There isn't any Sharptooth. (ALL SNORING) Hmm. Mmm. Mmm. (THUDDING) (GASPS) (GROWLING) (GROWLING) (GASPS) Wake up. Wake up! Wake up! Hey, stop that. (WHISPERING) Shh! It's Sharptooth. Cera, stop it. Shh! He'll eat us. He'll eat us! Run! Stop! Come back! (GASPS) Don't look back! Keep going! (GROWLING) (SCREAMING) (SNORTING) Now will you believe me? I'm sorry. We're safe now. Nobody's safe with you. (GASPS) Look, it's the rock that looks like a Longneck, just like my mother said. We're going the right way, the way to the Great Valley! NARRATOR: Littlefoot had been wrong about the Sharptooth, but the others followed him. Their only hope was to reach the Great Valley, and Littlefoot alone knew the way. (PANTING) Come on. Get up. We're going the right way. We got to keep moving up. Oh, you can't quit now. What if the Great Valley's just over the top of these rocks? NARRATOR: Though they were sore-stumped and tired, Littlefoot urged them on. He'd never seen the Great Valley, but his heart told him that they were close. Surely at the top, they'd behold it finally. CERA: This is your Great Valley? You're crazy. I'm leaving. Cera, we have to keep following the bright circle. I'm taking the easy way for once. But it's the wrong way. Who says? My mother. Then she was a stupid Longneck, too. Take that back. Never. Take it back! No! Spike! (PETRIE SHUDDERING) Spike, stop! Don't fall! You! CERA: Let go of my leg! (GRUNTING) Spike. CERA: Take that! (GRUNTING) Huh! Go on! Go the wrong way. We never wanted you with us anyway. Come on. We have to keep going. (GRUNTING) Come on. Cera's way is easier. I think so, too. Oh, Flat Head, wait! Ooh! (SCREAMING) Ow! No be angry. Wait! DUCKY: Cera, wait for us! We're coming with you, Cera! Cera, Spike, wait! DUCKY: (STAMMERING) I wish Littlefoot was here with us now. PETRIE: (STAMMERING) Me, too. Spike. (GASPS) Spike, do not stop. We must stay together. (BURBLING) (PETRIE SHUDDERING) (PETRIE SHUDDERING) (SCREAMING) (SPLUTTERING) Whoa! Cera, I... Whoa! Oh, Cera, Ducky, Spike! Help! DUCKY: Help, Cera! Cera, where are you? Littlefoot! Ducky! Help, Littlefoot! Hang on! I'm coming! Littlefoot! Quick, this way! Petrie! Hang on, Petrie! Help! Ooh! Flat Head! Ducky! Spike! Oh, Petrie am so happy. Jump, Petrie! Help, Ducky! Petrie, pull! Petrie. (SCREAMING) Help! Help! (GASPS) (SCREAMING) (SNARLING) (SCREAMING) Help me! Help me! Help! Woo! Get away! Get away from me! (SCREAMING) Stop it! Let go of me! Help! Help! Petrie, Spike, Ducky, help! Cera, it is us. (PANTING) (LAUGHING) (SCREAMING) (ALL LAUGHING) I knew it was you all along. I knew! I did! Oh, get out of my way. (ALL LAUGHING) Cera? Cera, come back! Cera! NARRATOR: Cera was still too proud to admit that... She'd gone the wrong way. (SNIFFLING) (SOBBING) (SPLUTTERING) (SPLUTTERING) (GROWLING) (SCREAMING) Sharptooth! DUCKY: It's Sharptooth. (GASPS) LITTLEFOOT: Let's get rid of him once and for all. DUCKY: What'll we do? Look, we'll coax him to the deep end of the pond. He can't swim with those scrawny arms. Me and Spike will go up and push that big rock on top of his head. And then he'll fall off into the water. Petrie, you whistle when he's just at the right spot where the water gets dark. Now we need some bait. Hmm. Me? Oh, no. No, no, no, no. (GROWLING) (HUMMING NERVOUSLY) (GROWLING) (SCREAMING) (SNARLING) (GROWLING) (SNARLING) Ducky! Ducky! (ROARING) (WHISTLING) LITTLEFOOT: Push, Spike, push with all your might! (GRUNTING) (LAUGHING) (YELPING) LITTLEFOOT: Petrie! I flying. I flying! I flying! Help! DUCKY: Petrie! I'm coming! LITTLEFOOT: Cera, you're back! (SCREAMING) (DUCKY SNIFFLING) He was my friend. Poor Petrie. Poor, poor Petrie. Petrie. (GASPING) Stop! You go without Petrie? Petrie. Oh! Petrie, you're safe! Yup, yup, yup, yup, yup, yup! MOTHER: Littlefoot. Littlefoot. Mother! Littlefoot. Mother? I tried to do what you told me, (SNIFFLING) but it's just too hard. I'll never find the Great Valley. (WIND BLOWING) Mother. Mother! Don't go, Mother! Don't go! The Great Valley. Cera, Spike, Ducky, Petrie, over here! Littlefoot, you found it! Yup, yup, yup. LITTLEFOOT: We did it. We did it together! (ALL LAUGHING) NARRATOR: The Great Valley was all they dreamed it would be, a land of green, of leaves, and life. There were waterfalls, grassy meadows, enough tree stars to feast on forever... And grazing upon them, their families. DUCKY: This is our new brother, Spike. Mama, I a Flyer! ALL: Yay! Daddy! Cera? Daddy. NARRATOR: And Littlefoot found his grandmother and grandfather at last, the same loving faces he'd looked into on the day of his birth. CERA: Littlefoot! Come on. I'll race you. NARRATOR: And they all grew up together in the valley, generation upon generation, each passing on to the next the tale of their ancestors' journey to the valley... Long ago.
