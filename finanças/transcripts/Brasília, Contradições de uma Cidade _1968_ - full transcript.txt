BRASILIA: CONTRADICTIONS OF A NEW CITY The structure of Brasilia is formed by two large axes that cross each other in a right angle, the Highway Axis and the Monumental Axis. In the design of the city, the principles of highway construction were applied to the principles of urban design. Crossing the city from end to end, the 15 lanes of the Highway Axis serve the residential and downtown areas. But there is a complete separation between vehicle traffic and pedestrian traffic. Cloverleafs and overpasses eliminate road crossings. On both sides of the Highway Axis a continuous sequence of large residential blocks spreads out framed by long belts of trees. Inside these super-blocks, apartment buildings are positioned in various ways, but they follow the same pattern of a maximum six stories resting on pillars. Access to the residences is gained through large open areas located between blocks, where the neighborhood church, the movie theater and small shops are located. The shops are designed to meet local needs and have two entrances. One facing the parking areas next to points of vehicle access. The other facing the green areas of the blocks, with access for pedestrians only. The super-block is a realm of comfortable family life. Protected from vehicular traffic, children have ample recreation areas and elementary schools close to their homes. Four super-blocks form an autonomous unit of collective habitation, with the convenience of a community life including a neighborhood sports club. In the current stage of the construction of the city, few units are completed. The clubs, churches and schools that are ready today serve more than one neighborhood unit. In Brasilia, there is frequently conflict between architecture and ornamentation, between the concept of the architect and the taste of the dweller. There isn't much nightlife yet. There's only one movie theater in the residential areas today. The entertainment center will be built in the large areas free from traffic on the platform formed by the crossing of the two structural axes of the city. Hotels, banks and office buildings will be located nearby. Even though the National Theater has not been completed, it is already in use. The center of activity in Brasilia spontaneously moved to route W3, which was primarily planned for the traffic of trucks. Trucks are not allowed there today. W3 works like the main street of a small town. This unforeseen function causes traffic jams, so common in other cities. The cemeteries are far from the hubbub. They're located on both ends of the Highway Axis... thus preventing funeral processions from crossing the urban center. The cemeteries will have lawns, trees, shallow graves and simple tombstones, without any ostentation. A great artificial lake will surround the town, in order to increase the humidity in the dry climate of the plateau. Brasilia was conceived to meet not only the needs of a modern city, but also to be the capital of the country, with all the traits that this function demands. The Alvorada Palace, the presidential residence, was conceived by the architect as the house of a common man, a Brazilian chosen to run the country. Despite its new original design, it reproduces the architectonic principles of the main house of a Brazilian ranch with a porch around it and a side chapel. Since its inauguration, it's had several dwellers. Five years after its foundation, Brasilia has over 300,000 inhabitants. Around 40,000 are civil servants. For the higher-ranking ones, despite the comfort of their residences, Brasilia still is just a distant and inconvenient workplace. I ended up here in 1959, with Oscar Niemeyer, a lifelong friend, with whom I work creating architectonic integration. The majority of the numerous intellectuals who went to Brasilia, attracted by the dimension of the human and artistic enterprise, left the city after 230 professors quit their jobs at the university, during the 1965 crisis. So that workers from all levels of civil service could live together in the same neighborhood, the apartments in Brasilia had to have three different economic patterns. They decided to go to Rio and São Paulo. Since my daughter is also a civil servant, we decided to stay... According to the plan, the city wouldn't be divided into rich neighborhoods and poor neighborhoods. There'd be integration instead of discrimination. This didn't happen. The buildings that were hurriedly built to house those who first ventured to come and work in Brasilia and who then prudently came alone, are used today by the large families of civil servants of low income. ...a child the possibility of going to school and all these schools are public. It isn't a matter of longing for the past. We can't think it will be as it used to. It's over. There is no coordination inside this structure anymore. Students are lost because they don't know what to do, nor what they're looking for. There's a bunch of lost people walking up and down the halls, looking for something to do to pass the time, waiting for lunchtime. The teachers who were hired don't have the will... LESS INCOMPETENCE ...to search for a new teaching methodology that suits Brazilian conditions. Either the school returns to a more traditional model, or it shuts down, which is probably for the best. They'll destroy all this. The University of Brasilia, which had been planned as the vanguard of higher education in Brazil, and that once achieved this position, today, is a university like any other. For most of its inhabitants, Brasilia is a city like any other. Two-thirds of the workers, including those who built it, live outside of Brasilia's city limits. At the end of a three-hour trip, the workers reach their neighborhood. These places are known as satellite cities or dormitory cities. Created spontaneously, or made by tractors in the deserted areas around the capital, these cities spread out horizontally, following obsolete urban models, the polar opposite to the plans of Brasilia. Coming from several different areas of Brazil, but mainly from the Northeast, these men brought the customs and culture of their homeland with them. Are you happy in Brasilia? Do you intend to continue living here? No, sir. - Do you intend to leave? - I do, sir. Why? Because Brasilia is no good for workers. In Brasilia, there are only construction companies. These firms start construction, and one firm opens two more firms, joined into one single company. When a worker is about to complete 90 days, they discharge him and register him in another one. But they're the same company. They do that so he won't accrue benefits. What about the union? Doesn't it help? No, it doesn't help at all. At least we ignore the union these days. The union used to be strong, but everything's changed, you know? Workers suffered a lot because of the union. Now they fear it. They say “Let's join the union!” and we say “No, sir, thank you.” - What did you help to build here? - I helped to build the IAPI Hospital, the IAPI blocks and many other buildings. Where did you live when you were working there? I lived in the IAPI lodging. Why did you all leave the IAPI? Because after we finished work on the IAPI buildings, they fired us. We had to move far away, to where there was public transportation. Why did you leave Paraíba for Brasilia? I came because it was hard there, and they said here it was good. - I sold everything and came here. - Are you okay here? No, because my homeland is there, and because here I have a boss. - And where do you live here? - I live on 42nd Street, house 23. - In one of these little houses? - Yes, sir. - Which one? - That one. - With the tiles? - Right. - Is all your family there? - No, but they're coming. They haven't come yet because I make very little money. - Does everybody fit in there? - Yes, sir. - How many people? - Seven. - How many bedrooms are there? - There are two. - Are they big or small? - Neither big nor small, average. Until recently, Brasilia was the new center of internal migration in Brazil. During construction, the migrant worker made five times more money than in the North and twice what he'd make in Rio or São Paulo. After the city's inauguration, the job market plummeted. Nevertheless, unemployed workers preferred to stay in Brasilia. They were poor people with very few belongings. Arriving here, they'd come in those trucks called... dump trucks. When they got here, they'd lift the bin. Even if there were children inside, they'd dump them. They'd dump everything, wood, furniture, everything. Those people's things were all damaged. We knocked down the trees with our bare hands. We used fire, we made campfires here so we'd be able to build our shacks. Some people slept outside. Kids died from cold here. Some adults died too. That's what happened to us. We went to a farm to work there. We bought the rights to work a small plot of land when some men appeared saying they were the owners. Then they sent someone to evict us, you know? They said they were the police and came to arrest us. They had machine guns. My brother was sitting, and I was standing by him. They said “Don't get up!” and he kept still. Then they said, “Get up!” and he got up. They searched us, and they handcuffed us, and they pushed us and we kept quiet. We didn't say anything. They took everything we had, pigs, chickens. A lot of chickens were left there. They took our animals, the beans, all that we had to eat. We worked the land and ate the beans we grew there. The Goiânia police took our beans. They took it all. And now we're here. We don't know what to do, you know? We don't know what to do. Vitória de Santo Antão. - What state? - Pernambuco. - Why did you leave Pernambuco? - I couldn't make a living. And you came to Brasilia for work? I came to Brasilia seeking work. - Did you come alone? - I came with my family. Can you show us your family in the bus? Sure. This one is my daughter... another daughter... the other daughter, and my wife. I'm 20. - Where do you come from? - I come from Paraíba. - What did you do there? - I worked at a drugstore. - Why did you leave? - The money wasn't good. - Why did you come to Brasilia? - I've come for work. - Did you come alone? - I came with these two fellows. What do you think your life will be like in Brasilia? I don't know. Good or bad? I don't know if it'll be good or bad. I don't know. The construction of Brasilia originated from the need to conquer and develop the interior of the country, and it promises to leap ahead of the natural process of socioeconomic development. The new capital was conceived by Brazilian politicians more than one century ago, not only as a seat of government that could remain distant from public pressure, but also as the center of domestic integration and a central hub of South America. Brasilia was the great opportunity offered to Brazilian architecture: a whole city to be designed from the start according to the most modern techniques of urban design and with absolute creative freedom. When it expels from its bosom the humble men who built it and those who are yet to come, Brasilia embodies the basic conflict of Brazilian art, beyond the reach of the majority of the people. The architects' designs proposed a just city, devoid of social discrimination. But as the designs became reality, the problems grew beyond the urban limits within which they were meant to be contained. In fact, these are national problems, present in every city in Brazil, but in Brasilia, a city designed with such generosity, they are revealed with unbearable clarity. We have to change this reality so we can see in the face of the people, how beautiful a city can be. I'm Viramundo, turned upside-down Across the hinterland But someday I'll turn this world Into celebration, work and bread The world will be turned upside down And they will see me The transformer of this world Shrewd, cunning and thieving Turned upside down by the world Which has been turned once again Someday I'll turn this world Into celebration, work and bread Into celebration, work and bread Brasilia: Contradictions of a New City was restored using two very discolored prints. The original negative could not be located. It was possibly discarded by its producers, displeased with the political content of the film. The original film sync was maintained. Digital 2K restoration completed in São Paulo, December 2004.
