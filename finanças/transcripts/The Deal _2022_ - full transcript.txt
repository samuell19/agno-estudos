Subtitles by Renatinha Tankinha Tala? Thank you for all your work. And congratulations on your processing. Thank you. Global weather circles are rising to new heights. Increased winter temperatures mean a further reductions in water... Citizens are reminded to recycle all water. Analyn! Last meat for today. Let them pass. Let them through. She took The Deal. Come on! -Do you want it? -Mom, don't. -We need proteins. -So? Yes, please. Why does she get that? What? Do you want meat? Take The Deal. Keep moving. Hey, what are you doing? Where are your papers? Sorry, sorry. They are here. Please, no way. I'm sorry. I'm not eating that. Fine. If you don't want to eat, let's go over this again. If you run out of cash, sell the paint. You can get more for blue. You have five days left. And you want to talk about paint? I need to make sure you understand everything that you need to do. I know what I have to do. Sell the paint. No! First use the cash, then sell the paint and then jewelry. You need to listen. -It's the same thing. -It's not! There's an order to things if you want to survive! -There are hidden opportunities… -I don't care about hidden opportunities. This is gold. You should get at least 100 units for it. -75 for these. -Stop. Save this for last. This has been in the family before The Deal. -It's worth 600... -Mom... don't go under 400. Mom! I don't want your jewelry. -Then what do you want? -I want you to not die. You know that's not possible. But maybe we can find a way. They have a ticking clock inside of me. They put it there. Yeah, I know. It's a great choice you made back then. I hope it was worth it. -Again? -I got it! It's blinding! Yes, girl! Thanks, Analyn! You got this! Nice trick. The lights. It's a gift and two years of electrical engineering school. Nice! I didn't go to school. And how did it work out for you? Well, I work at the morgue, so, stellar. The morgue? So you're with The Bureau? No, but no one at the Bureau wants to touch a corpse, so they outsource. It stinks, but it gets me access to things. Like dead people? Like their clothes, jewelry, gold teeth... Anything I can sell. Kabira. I just moved to these blocks. Analyn. Nice to meet you, Analyn. What are you doing? Looking for scar where they injected your timer. I didn't take The Deal. Then why bother with engineering? It's not like they'll let you have a job that far up the ladder? I'm hoping my skills will get me out of here. There is no way out of here. There's The Railroad. The Bureau shut them down like years ago. No, they're still watching us. Figuring out who is useful. And whisking them off to a magical land where they can turn off your timer and candy grows out of the grass? I heard it was a trap to like a way to pick out the rebels. It's real. Name one person who's gone out that way. My father. And you saw him go? It was before I was born. So your mother said that's how he went? She said he disappeared. Then he left her for another woman. Or he's dead somewhere. No. He got out. Of course he did. Hey, Analyn. Are you okay? I have to go to work. But if you find to find the Railroad, let me know. I could sell the hell out of information like that. Hey, Gin! Are you okay? I'm just a little dizzy. Again? Okay, whatever you say. It's probably your brew. My brew is low quality, baby. You broke into the university lab again. Serves them right for expelling me. You know a better way to make a living without taking The Deal, I'm all ears. What's with the girl from the morgue? Kabira? Oh, no. The lady's jealous. I'm not jealous. She's creepy. She said the Railroad is a lie. Maybe it is. And even if it's not, where is it going to go? There is nothing out there. Everything past those walls is either bombed, or poisoned or died in the heat. Listen, here isn't great, but at least it won't kill you. Oh, shit. I'm sorry. This is about your mom? I yelled at her again. I look at her and I think about her processing. And I want to scream at someone. But there's no one to scream at. Except her. And she just sits there and takes it. What else do you want her to do? I want her to scream with me. I want her to fight! I want her to say it's not okay. -I want her to-- -To live? When my parents went for... processing, I... let a bus on fire. At least you're not a permanent danger. I wish I could make this easier for you, but I can't. Just know that when she's gone, I'm gonna be right here waiting for you. Us against the world. Us against the world. Analyn? What's up? It's late. Where were you? Out. You went out dressed like that? What the... I was wearing a suit. Do you know what happens if they catch you like that? They force me to kill myself? You have to stop hanging out with those people. Those people are my friends. They'll get you in trouble. They'll keep me alive. Or would you rather I be alone after? Just disappear into the walls? If it keeps you from dying, yes. I'd rather risk it and have an actual life. You can do better than Gin. Yeah, like you did? I'm sorry. Are you okay? I'm fine. You're burning up. -We're going to the doctor first thing. -It's nothing. We're going to a doctor while you still have access to one. No life is possible outside of our wall. The wall protects us from the diseased wasteland left behind by the virus. Stay within the wall, stay safe. No life is possible outside of our wall. The wall protects us from the diseased wasteland left behind by the virus. Rich assholes. I heard in their enclave, even the streets are air-conditioned. Don't believe everything you hear. You really don't trust anyone, do you? I trust you. Stop. You said I should look out for hidden opportunities. No cameras, lots of medical supplies. Opportunity. You're considering it. I'm not considering it. You totally are. Maybe some bandages. You're a bit clumsy. I am not. Ms. Bayani. Yes? -Analyn Bayani? -Yes. What's wrong with her? -It's nothing. -We don't know that. It could be something serious. Your kidneys are failing. You need a transplant. Are you upper income? No. Organs are prioritized for upper income citizens. -You are her mother, right? -Yes. Good. Relatives are usually the best match. Front desk can schedule the surgery, until then this should help with the dizziness and the nausea. Mom... It will be fine. You'll be okay. Though suffering is all around us. Starvation, lack of clean water and medical care. Families are forced to live on the streets. Children who don't know when they will eat again. It doesn't have to need to be like this. There is a better way. When you take The Deal, you provide your family with 20 years of food, water, a home of your own. When your time is up, drift off to asleep knowing that when resources were scarce you didn't take more than your fair share. The Deal is a gift. Take it. Okay, here we are. Analyn. So, we have an opening in six months. We need something sooner. That's the soonest. What about another doctor? Can we get a referral to someone else? The earliest appointment with anyone is in six months. You don't understand. My processing is in four days. I have two good kidneys that will be wasted. Are there any other family members or close relative? There's only us. What about her father? Just us. Then I'm afraid we can't help you. Are you telling me my daughter might die because of scheduling? Year regulations are very specific about these kinds of situations, ma'am. Move someone. I'm not allowed to do that. Move someone. -Regulations say that-- -I don't care about regulations! -Move someone! -Mom... -Move someone. -Security to Admissions. -Move someone! -Mom, we have to go. I'll take The Deal. You took it and it was fine. You're not taking The Deal. It's okay, mom. It's like the Bureau says. A Deal is a gift. The Deal is a curse. You're not taking it. I'll find another way. The Bureau of Life ensures humanity's continued survival. We are the way to a sustainable future. We protect humanity from the wasteland beyond the wall. We are happiness. We are peace. We are hope. We are salvation. We are the way through the apocalypse. -You'll be okay. -You’ll be okay. Is there a problem? No. We're okay, aren't we? Young lady, you should be very proud of your father. He's doing all of this because he loves you. Don't worry, you'll be okay. You will all be okay. No, no! -Don't worry. -Everything will be fine. -I promise. -It'll be okay! Welcome to the Bureau of Life. How may I help you? I need to talk to someone about getting an extension on my time. I'm sorry, there are no extensions. I am not saying I won't be processed. I am just asking to postpone it six months. My daughter needs surgery and there are no openings. Your daughter can take The Deal. There's still no guarantee that she'll get a kidney. I have one to give her. It will be easier for the Bureau. It's much more efficient. It would take less resources. I just need a little more time. -The Deal is-- -I know what The Deal is. I have spent every day of my adult life selling it. I am asking you to make an exception. She's my daughter. I can't go peacefully if I don't know she's safe. You should have thought of it before you had children. You only have yourself to blame for putting her in this situation. Myself to blame? Please, I'm begging you… I will pay you. Bribing an official is punishable. By what? Death? Your daughter can take The Deal. Excuse me, ma'am? Excuse me. What? I overheard your conversation. I can help. Analyn, hurry. We'll miss the bus. I used to want one of these when I was little. I know. I'm sorry. Hello. Do you have the money? This way, please. Please change into the gowns. How long will it take? Three hours. Approximately. Excuse me. Wait! Can you remove timers? No. If you try to disarm them, they go off. And what is it like, when they go off? What exactly happens if you don't turn up on the Bureau on your day? -It doesn't matter. -I want to know. It heats your blood. Instantly. You boil from the inside? I'm not boiling. Gowns, please. Analyn! What are you doing? Mom, it's for holding an organ. Why would they need to hold an organ if he's transplanting right away? Do you want him to leave me open while he's operating on you? This is normal. Female, 19, liver. Female, 39, eyes. Female, 39, two kidneys. Female, 19, heart. Mom, that's us. He's gonna kill us. Pick up in three hours. And it will be a larger shipment today. It's locked! All right then. Everything seems to be fine. Damn it! Mom! We need to find another doctor. Mom, we were almost chopped up and sold. We'll find another doctor. No! We'll find another donor. What about my father? No. He is a relative. He's more likely to be a match. We don't know where he is. He may be dead. The Bureau has all that on file. We can't just ask for that information. Hello Gin. Please, come in. What is all that? I studied chemistry, but... No Deal, no job. Right? Hey... Hey man, this stuff is mine. -We're good, yeah? -Yeah. Peace. We do business together. You didn't take The Deal. How did you get Bureau Housing? I have a friend who works in the cleaning crews. It texts me whenever a bomb goes off at someone. You know. And before somebody else moves in, I sell everything that they leave behind. -That's… -Pathetic. Smart. I should have thought of it. Okay. We need to get into Bureau records. -That's not easy. - Can I hack in? You know how to hack? I took a course. Not on an official course. You can't just hack it from the outside. It is a secured system. It requires a face scan to access. Is there a way to get that? There is Bureau official that has remote terminal who can be bought, but it is expensive. Will this be enough? No. Just give us the address. Please. The Bureau reminds citizens, to avoid the northern sectors of the wall, where murder and theft are on the rise and police presence is limited. Reports of looting and killing by scavenger groups in these abandoned areas have reached violent pre-deal levels. Remember, safety comes first. I'll give you a hundred for it. It's worth 600. This has been in my family for three generations. To me it's worth a hundred. -You are crazy! -Analyn. We're not selling to this asshole. Now it's 75. I thought my life was worth more than this. Everybody does. Wherever this Bureau official lives, it's really far away. The buses don't even go there. It's in the enclave. What? It's impossible to get into. Mom? Where are you going? Hello? What are you doing? Getting us to the enclave. What? So, you won't steal cotton balls, but this you're cool with? Shut up and get in. No keys. -Do you know how this works? -No, but it's wiring. I know wiring. -Okay, do it, do it, do it. Do you know how to drive? I watched my father do it. It didn't look that hard. Come on, come on... He's coming, he's coming! Come on! Yes, I got it! Here he comes! Come on, Mom, go! -Go! -I'm on it! Mom! Go, go, go... Go! Freeze! Stop! Stop the van! Take the map! Find the enclave. This is it. The enclave. Shit. I had no idea there were going to be this many guards. We don't have papers. They'll arrest us. Go to the back. See if you can find something. -Like what? -Anything! Hurry! Wait... -Put this on. -Oh, good. Good. Okay. Ma'am, go. Go! Yes. -Okay. -Can I come out? It worked. It worked. It worked. Unbelievable. We have to die for 20 years of food rations and they're living like this? Let's go. We just pay the guy, he lets us use his terminal and then we'll look for my father? I do not know. I've done this before. Yes? Is your husband here? No, sorry. He's at work. Do you have the money? Yes. Then come in. Beautiful. The money, please. Sorry, we expected a man. Women can break the law just as well. You are. The money. You're short ten. Come back when you have it all. I'll be dead by then. Without this information my daughter dies too. I am asking you as a mother. Do you have kids? You women with children, you all think you are so goddamned special. Please. Please. We all need an escape plan. You have yours. I have mine. You have ten minutes. Okay. Michael Bayani. Is he dead? No. He lives in our district. We're just gonna go in, tell him what we need, and make arrangements. There's reason to be nervous. -I'm not nervous. -Neither am I. -Mom? -What? One us should probably knock. Hi. What are you doing here? Nice to see you too. Meet Analyn. She's your daughter. Hey. Hi. I'm gonna… inside. This isn't awkward? I'm sorry, would you like tea? I can make tea. -I think I have tea. -We don't need tea. Okay. This is nice. I guess you made it work after all. Architect? Engineer. You're an engineer? Yes. Why? No reason. You're shorter than I thought you'd be. Oh, I'm sorry. Why? Did you do something to make yourself shorter just to spite me? That was a joke. To break the ice. Really thick ice. Here's the situation. My processing is in four days. And our daughter needs a kidney. We can't schedule the surgery in time, so she's going to need one of yours. Well, when is it... when is it scheduled for? Six months. Have you tried to move it up? What do you think? Have you looked for other matches? You are her father. You're the best match. It's not that simple. Why don't you want to help us? -I can't -Why not? Because my processing is in four and a half months. You took The Deal? Yes. I'm sorry. I'm not going to be able to help you. -You took The Deal? -It was complicated. Complicated? You're making this up. I'm not making this up. Why would I make it up? If I didn't take the deal, do you think I'd be living in a place like this? I do not know. You seemed to think anything was possible, no matter how unrealistic. Well, you did too, but then... -Then what? -Nothing. -What don't I know? -Nothing! You can't help us. -We should go. -Does she know why I left? Because you're an asshole who couldn't handle the responsibility of being a father? Is that what you told her? We're going. I left because your mother took The Deal. Right. I'm the bad guy. We had an agreement neither of us was going to take it, but then you went back on it. We could've made it together. A lot of people-- Have nothing. Live on the streets? Is that what you want for us? You think we could have talked about it first? I knew how you'd react. No, you had no idea how I would react. -You didn't even give me a chance. -I didn't need to. You did exactly what I thought you would. You left. You made a decision that affected both of your lives without talking to me. I was the one who was pregnant. You took The Deal because of me? Excuse me. Are you in pain? The illness, honey. Does it... does it hurt? They gave me pills. You know, I would help you if I could. Do I? We need to go. Tala, wait! Tala! -Tala... -We don't have time. I need to find a way to save my daughter. I'm... I'm sorry. So am I. Analyn. I'm glad I got to meet you. Mom! Wait! Keep up! Slow down! We need to get home. Stop! This is why I never wanted you to meet him. He steps into your life, upsets it, and runs away. I don't know why I expected anything different. What do you mean runs away? I found a bag hidden in the shower. He's going somewhere. Are you sure? I knew he was lying. I felt it. Where is he going? I don't know. It must be the Railroad. -There is no Railroad. -What if there is? It could save us both. Even if it is real, I have four days. Well, maybe that's enough. Mom, this is our only chance. We should follow him. Analyn, let's go! The sun will be down soon. It was a good home. The ramp was a little steep. Wait! There's something I need to do before we go. Gin? I'll wait outside. Hurry. Michael can leave any time after dark. Thanks, mom. Gin? Analyn. Hey, what's up? Nothing. Is Gin here? No, no. We were supposed to meet up, but when I got here, No Gin. What's with the backpack? Are you going somewhere? It's just some stuff for Gin to sell. Cool. -Let me see. -No, it's, uh... I'm in a rush and it's all packed in tight. If you see Gin, tell him... sorry I missed him. Sure thing. Cool. Be careful out there. We have to go. -What happened to Gin? -We have to go! Shit! I think we lost it. Can you see him? We'll take turns keeping watch. I'll take first watch. No. You sleep. I won't, I got it. -You need to rest. -I'm wired. Analyn! Go to sleep. So you don't trust me. I trust you. You think I'm gonna fall asleep. I think you're going to go over there. He is our way to get out of this place. That's all. Fine. He couldn't have been all bad if you hooked up with him, right? There had to be something redeemable. He was a dreamer. He thought we could all make it without taking The Deal? -He did. -But you didn't? I was afraid. Fear makes you act not like yourself. He is afraid. We are in a restricted zone. No one is supposed to be out after dark. Go to sleep. Wake up! -What? -I fell asleep! -You what? -I fell asleep! He's gone! No, here he right here. You need to stop following me. It's not safe. For your own good, pack your stuff and go home. Where are you going? Nowhere that concerns you. Tell us where you're going or we'll go to the police. I'm going to a place beyond the reach of the Bureau. How did you find it? They found me. Bit small, but it functions like a city. They have electricity, they have water reserves. One of their engineers died. They needed a replacement. They selected me. Do they have doctors? They have everything. But they were attacked once. They were almost wiped out. Now they don't let anybody in. They only give you enough information to get to the next station. Like a Railroad? Yeah. Why didn't you just tell us? They only let me in. We'll risk it. What about timers? Can they take them out or turn them off? They can. Scavengers. Here, this way. Come on. Oh, God! There! Shit! They're coming this way. Come on. -Are you OK? -Yeah! Good. No, this way. This way, this way! Are you okay? My bag's back there. The pills were in it. How many days do you have ? Three. Is that enough time to get to the place? If we move fast enough. And they don't let us wait. I'm fine. I'm okay! Let's go? I can't promise to get you in, but I can get you there. Thanks. There are guards everywhere. Why would they send you here? Is this the only way over the wall? No. It's the only way is under. Okay. You guys wait here. What? I'll come back for you. No, wait! You're not leaving us. I'll come back for you. No. Yeah, you're right. Why don't all three of us just walk in there? In fact, why don't we get those guys to drive us over ? We need to find another way. We can't trust him. Give him a chance. Maybe he changed. What would have change him? Me. I'm fucking delightful. I told you. Told her what? Nothing. Okay, put this on. There! Up there. Come on. That's him! He said it was just one. Yeah, they're with me. You cannot just change. I am his daughter. We're a family. We can't stay here. Go. You have to go through the tunnels. From there it is easy to get to the water. The boat will meet you tomorrow morning. Hey! What are you doing here? We were told there was leak. Papers, now! I have them. You. Come here. Where are your papers? Papers, now! We have a situation in zone 5... Come on! -Let's go. -Analyn, we have to go. -Analyn! -No! Get down here, quick! I'll distract them. Go! Go! -Good luck. -Thank you. Follow me. -Are you okay? -Yes. Here. I'm sorry. About what? I should have asked you before I took the Deal. Yeah, yeah, you should have. Forget it. I was trying to be nice. No, wait. Tala, wait. You did a really good job with her. She is great. Yeah. She is great. She is stubborn. Like you. I'm the stubborn one? There's a lot I regret. Decisions I made. Yes, I know a lot about bad decisions. I lived with mine for 20 years. Do you ever wonder what would happen if… What we would...give... Everyday. Every single day. Over here! Turn off your flashlights. Daylight. Okay, let's go. Turn! Are you alright? I'm fine. We are on the other side. Come on. Now what? We camp here for the night. Has this been here the whole time? No. It's growing back. This was all I could find. It will be a small fire. Mom's getting more. So… You were this big dreamer. What happened? Why did you give up so fast? Turns out those dreams meant nothing without your mother, nothing without you. So, I gave up. Took The Deal. What are you making? Stew. What's in it? Stuff from cans. Let me. You think I can't cook? I know you can't cook. You see what I were saying about her. What were you saying about me? That you're fun. Fine. Please , impress us with your skills. What? Nothing. It's nice out here. There's a boat. There's a boat! Come on. What will we do? How do we do this? Let me speak. Any fish here? Not since the winter, not since the rain. I'm Michael. Only supposed to be one. There's been a change. No change. Let me explain. Any change in the plan, the pickup is ended. We are family. No. Listen... Only supposed to be one. Take Analyn. She is sick. -She is young. -No. I'm not going without you. We go together. Any change in plans the pickup is abandoned. We will explain when we are there. Any change in plan... Take all of us or I'll kill you. You don't know where to go. I'm sorry. No… No! No! -Go, now. -You can't! -I'm sorry. - Give your place to Analyn! -It doesn't work that way. -Dad, Stop! -Stop! -No! Stop. They are too far. We have to find a boat! Or hire someone. Or wait until another boat comes along to pick up other people. We say we are them. It won't work. We have to do something. We can't get this close. We can't get this close. -We have to go back home. -No. It will be okay. It won't be okay. I'm not going to be okay. You're not going to be okay. You have to be strong. I can't. I can't. We have to go. We don't have much time. I need you to do this for me. If we hurry, we can get back before morning. What about all that security? It is all designed to keep people from getting out, not getting in. The jewelry is gone. There is still little cash. That's more than enough. It's not. Not for food and doctors. You'll have to take the Deal. I'm sorry. Mom. It's okay. I should go. I'm coming with you. No, I don't want you to see it happen. -Mom, I'm coming with you. -No! No. Goodbye my sweet girl. I love you, mom. I love you. Forever. Welcome to the Bureau of Life. How can I help you? I'm here for my processing. Please fill out these forms and join the queue. Oh, my God, are you okay? No! She left. My mom left. I tried. We tried everything, but it didn't work. I don't know what to do. There's nothing I can do. There might be. -No. -What is he talking about? Do you want to save your mother? -There is a way. -I said no. Gin, she is asking if there is anything she can do, and there is. What are you talking about? Whatever she wants... Please, don't. If there is a chance that I can save my mother, you have to tell me. Please put this on. Congratulations on your noble sacrifice. The Bureau thanks you. The city thanks you. The world thanks you. You are part of a global movement, which ensures that the planet's limited resources will sustain generations to come. Your children will think of this day with pride. They will be awaiting their own contribution. Humanity continues because of you. The world lives on because of you. You have received your fair share, and you have enjoyed it. Now you may go in peace. -Miss, there's a line. -I do not have time! Hello! Tala Bayani? I need a verbal confirmation. Yes. You're gonna feel a small shock. We're done here. I've reset your timer. You're free to go. Free to go? See you back here in another 20 years. I don't understand. The Deal is 20 years for a life. Yes. Someone traded their life for yours. And bought you another 20. Who? Analyn Bayani. Is that a relative? No, she can't do that. It's not allowed. -There's an exemption when there's a medical condition. -Where is she? Where is my daughter? -It is being processed as we speak. -Where is my daughter? Security. Code 5-22! Analyn! Today I leave this earth... Today I leave this earth... Like a flower, I remain in bloom for eternity. Like a flower, I remain in bloom for eternity. My sacrifice makes the world better for those who come. My sacrifice makes the world better for those who come. Analyn Bayani, are you ready to die? I'm ready to die. What are you doing here? Wake up. Wake up, baby! Wake up. Come on , sweetheart! I'm here. Wake up! Wake up! We got her. We'll take her. -Move. -What? Move. What are you doing here? Come on! What is that? Gin! What's happening? -It's not working -Give it a minute. Why isn't she waking up? I do not know. That's why I said we should do it. It wasn't ready! What are you doing to her? -Wake her up! -I'm trying. -Oh, my God! -Mom? I'm here. Hello. How did this happen? We've been watching your daughter for a while now. She has skills that are useful to us. -Do you work for the Railroad? -Not me. Her. The original plan was to get Analyn out, but... I wasn't going anywhere without you. I didn't think they would agree to take you both, but her father talked them into of it. All we needed was a way to get you out. I knew I could do something that make her look dead. But I wasn't hundred per cent sure that she would wake up again. Don't look at me like that. I told her not to do that. She is stubborn. We have to go. Now. -Hei! -Shaun. Are they coming after us? Mom, we're Ok now. You can breathe. Breathe. Alright, everyone settle down. We have a Bureau van and papers. But there is still a long way.
