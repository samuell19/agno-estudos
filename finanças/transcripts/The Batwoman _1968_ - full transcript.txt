The Bat Woman Look! Another case adds itself to the chain of crimesl suffered by Acapulco's athletes. With "Lightning" the wrestler, who was found drowned at the beach, A total sum of five vanquished victims, of the mysterious assassin, who has yet to be captured. "SECRET SERVICE" The police has done nothing , to prevent this series of attacks, which terrorize the coastal population. These reporters do not pass an opportunity to disseminate their yellow journalism , Without considering the characteristics of the case. No clues, no leads, nothing, NOTHING! Similar murders were committed some time ago in Macao and Hong Kong It seems the cases are all related, such is the assessment of the International Intelligence Bureau, who has commissioned a special agent, to follow the leads on the assassin ,here, in Acapulco. - Yes? - Mr. Mario Robles is here, inspector. - Tell him to come in. It is the special agent -Uhu... -Good evening - Good evening -Hello - Sit down. - Thanks. - Hello, Robles, my friend, Do you bring good news? - Yes inspector, as we had agreed, I've have made contact with the person who can help us, - and with whom I have resolved various cases. - The Bat Woman? - Yes sir, I've told her the whole story and she is willing to collaborate with us. - Great! - Who is this woman? - Don't you know her? - No. - It is difficult describing her with mere words. She is a wonderful woman, immensely wealthy, who lives in the nation's capital. Her fortune has placed her at the service of justice, Tirelessly fighting against evil.. Gifted with uncommon qualities, she has mastered all sports in short time Behind a mask, and, under the pseudonym of "The Bat Woman," She became an extraordinary wrestler. - And this outstanding individual is the Bat Woman. - What an extraordinary woman! You will have to content yourself to see her with a mask, if organized crime knew her identity, she would be eliminated immediately. Only another person and myself know her secret identity and we have sworn to guard her identity, even at the cost of our lives. With her qualities as a wrestler, I believe she will be quite convenient for us, as she will be able to carry out her inquiry without raising suspicion among the wrestling scene. Who seem to be the preferred targets of the assassin, for some special reason. -And to further guard appearances, I have arranged with a arena's promoter, to have some fights here. Very good idea! - When will she arrive? - Tomorrow, somewhere around noon. (Unintelligible journalistic sassafras) I am very sorry, please! (Journalistic sassafras continues) Well, she is gone, The case must be complicated , from the moment the called upon the Bat Woman. Well then, write that down! The result of the autopsy, Inspector. And what did you find, Doctor? That pineal gland secretions have been extracted surgically. Exactly like the others. - Then the assassin must be a doctor! - An extraordinary surgeon. Look at this... As you can see, there's a small cavity in the victim's cranium They probably used a siphoning device, right there, Nice work, they barely left a mark. What could this diabolical doctor be looking for with these interventions? I am oblivious of that. We know less about that gland, than we know about the rest of the human body. - Then, there's nothing we can do? - Nothing, only wait for the assassin to make a mistake. Or another crime... Has everything been prepared, Igor? - Yes, master. Good. Open the lid. Close off the tank. Increase the pressure to 20 Decibels. 20 Decibels, Dr. Williams. Hurry! Hurry! there is a leak, Igor! - Ready? - Yes Master! Now! No reaction...Igor, we have to do a new experiment to create our man-fish. - When? - NOW! As soon as possible, We need another wrestler who can provide more pineal fluid for the transplant. - But master, it is quite dangerous at this moment, the police... - Silence! Success is within our grasp, we cannot stop now! We can't fail now! - Why must it be precisely a wrestler? There are other kinds of subjects. - Yes, but without the qualities required for our goals. We need athletes! Men of supreme physical strength! That can assure us a perfect specimen...just I have dreamed. Hurry, contact our men, and have them bring another subject. They know where to find it. I have today's lottery ending in seven, I have today's ending in seven, buy today, claim your prize tomorrow. Today's lottery, in seven, in seven Wait! What's up, Jose? What's going on? -You bring me good news? -Of course, Swede, when have I ever failed you.! - I had to do quite a bit of haggling, but I got you the boat at half price. -Right on man! What, you going fishing? Yeah, all evening, I am sailing to the islets, and I will bring you all fish this big! -Awesome! -Good luck, Swede! Thanks, Mr. Jose, for your help. It was nothing, you know it, I am at your service. - Nice old man, this guy -True Well then, I am off to see if I can catch a sword fish, a red snapper, or a mahi-mahi! - Did I hurt you Esmeralda? - Not at all, but thanks for allowing me to train with you. - We will train as often as you wish! - Thanks! -Goodbye! What a stupendous girl is Bat Woman! Hello? Mario? Any news? None, our men are on patrol over the entire port without results. How about over there? I've not observed anything out of the ordinary. And the agent is monitoring the phone? - Nothing. - Ok. I hope it will remain that way, although I doubt it. We'll be in contact. OK. See you later. - Anything interesting? - Only calls of no importance. - We should investigate them anyway. - Of course. Wait! They're making a call. Number 3? It's number 1 . Advice Dr. Williams that I have arranged the affair for this afternoon. They got him, Igor! Look! Yes, master! yes. Number 1 has arrived with the new donor. - Splendid. Everything is prepared for the operation, bring him in immediately. Bring him in! Secure him with the straps. - Did you have any problem? - None, sir. But the Bat Woman is in Acapulco, that policewoman may cause problems for us. Not to worry, after this operation, we will leave for another country. Come on, Igor! Quick! Anesthetize him! Hurry, Igor, hurry! We shall succeed!...Make it move to the left. Now to the right. Make it stop, Igor! Make it stop! - Maximum pressure, maximum pressure! - Yes, master! Perfect...perfect! Prepare yourself, Igor, prepare yourself! For you are about to witness the greatest event of the century! From the sea, more that 400 million years ago, the human race had its beginnings. As it sprung to life, the first vertebrate, fish. Understanding this fact, we shall cause a regression to the beginnings of evolution. And we shall create, in the image and likeness of our ancestors...the Human-Amphibian creature! (Diabolical Laughter) - Look! Look! - Excellent!, Excellent, Igor! - We have taken a great step towards the realization of our desires! - It is so, Master, I never doubted we would accomplish it! - What shall we do with that man? - Have him disposed off unto the rocks. As far away as possible. Give the order to provision the ship, and advise the maritime authorities. - We'll set out as soon as we are ready. - Very good, master. This is where the boat was found, from which, "Swede," the wrestler, disappeared. Without leaving any clues, right? That is correct, had he drowned, the body should have surfaced by now. Could he be stuck between the rocks? No...our divers have searched this entire area without results. - What would you like? - A lemonade, please Orangina for me. -Say, was the call made from the gym investigated? - Yes. - And to whom does the phone number correspond to? - Hmm, a pool hall. - Ok, but what of the Doctor to whom the message was intended for ? Correct. There is a doctor, named Eric Williams, a reclusive individual who lives in his yacht, the "Reptilicus" for about six months now. He is a neurosurgeon but does not practice the profession, he collects fish, as a hobby, and has no acquaintances. Since we suspect the author of these crimes to be a man of science, I feel we are on the right track, Mario. I will communicate with the capital immediately, with our special international agent, Tony Roca, So he may gather all available information on Dr. Williams and the Reptilicus, and bring it to us. I will be glad to greet him, only you and he know my identity. We have solved many cases. - What do you want ? - I'm looking for Dr. Williams. - The Doctor does not receive visitors. - Tell him I'm here, please. I told you the Doctor does not receive visitors, so it is better for you to leave. - Hello. I bring you a nice surprise. - Hello! - You are more lovely every day, Gloria. - And you always so charming. To me, she is the most precious woman in the world, so nice and sweet. Enough with the flattery, for we have a very important situation to resolve, boys. Before anything, I want to commend you both for the work you are doing. Ah, here I have all the information on Dr. Williams, and his ship, the Reptilicus. Indeed they arrived from Hong Kong, and Macao. - how did you find the lead? - The call made from the gym to Dr. Williams, the mysterious disappearance Swede, the wrestler, that same afternoon. And the special circumstance that Dr. Williams is a neurosurgeon, understand? I tried to board the Reptilicus, but to no avail, they would not even let me step on board. I will give the order to search the ship. No, we can't do that, with what charges? You know the law must act always under certain norms. Excuse me. Yes? It's me speaking, inspector. OK. good bye. The Inspector has informed me, that the Reptilicus is being readied to sail, tomorrow. I have to act immediately. "The Pineal Gland: Cause and effect of the fluid on aquatic organisms" Halt! Hands up! Boss, look what we've found! Move! Follow her...follow her!....follow her! Capture her! Capture her, she is unarmed! Hurry! It's easy! Capture her, she has no escape, capture her! This way! There she is! Open fire! - We must capture that woman, at all costs, Number 1! - But master, are you not aware that we do not know her identity? You lot will have to solve that problem yourselves, use your brains! Come up with a way to find out who she is, ouch! And as soon as possible! Nothing matters to me now! Only to have my revenge on that damned woman, argh! - Congratulations Esmeralda, you learn more every day. - All thanks to your advice. - See you later! - Bye! Who wants the lucky ticket! - Can I drive you home, Esmeralda? - Thanks, but someone is picking me up. - Very well then. Have fun. See you tomorrow. - See you tomorrow Are you crazy? Do you want to kill her in broad daylight? We will follow my plan, let's go! We'll wait. She has to come out this way. - It's impossible to single her out, from so many women. - It doesn't matter, we now know her car. We shall act in due time. - Still thinking about it? - I can't get it out my head, Mario. I could swear that what I saw in the aquarium, was a Man-Fish. Sounds incredible, doesn't it? If you witnessed it all trough the key hole, your eyesight could have failed you. -I can wager that what you so was only a fish. - Maybe, but I'd like to be sure. -You are not telling me you are going to try again? - No, it would be very dangerous right now. I believe so, and for next time, do not be so egoistical and inform me of your intentions, would you? Well then, I have to leave, orders, but I wish you luck , you will need it. We will need it, and if you never hear from us again, remember us fondly, would you? - Captain? - Yes, Diaz, go ahead. - Will you allow me a moment? - What's up? - Thanks. I have to leave. - Has something happened? - It seems that way . - Can I go with you? No, no, take your time getting dressed, I shall brief you later. - Let's go. Increase speed... put on your masks. A car is approaching. Follow me! Don't move! Step back! Drop your weapons! Drop the weapons! Get back! I will call headquarters to have you taken into custody. We will take her to an isolated place. Would you dare shoot me from behind? That would be the best thing for you, but we have something worse in store. The police! Run away! - The same symptoms as the others ,Doctor? - Yes, captain. perforation of the cranium with pineal fluid extraction. And you still doubt the culprit is Dr. Williams? Is one more victim not enough? Who but him could have ordered the attempt on my life? There are too many coincidences that you are not taking into account, Mario. Calm down and try to understand my position, we have no proof to legally act against him. And those coincidences that you mention, and make him a suspect to you, are not enough. Very well, do forgive me. But unfortunately, I am sure this chain of crimes will continue. I only wish that the next victims are neither you nor I. Thank you Doctor. But how could it be possible you have failed! You are useless , the lot of you! - But master, we... - Don't tell me anything! Do not try to justify your and your men's imbecility! We shall discuss it later, what is important now is my experiment. I cannot wait any longer, have them don the diving suits. Let's go. - Have you found the exact position we need? - Yes, master. I think this place meets all the requirements. - The water temperature must not be half a degree below 22 Celsius. -22 Celsius, exactly. - Depth? - Depth is 100. Perfect. this will provide us the pressure we need. - Have the reactors charged the irradiation unit? - At it's maximum potency, master. Correct. It will be sedated until we irradiate it. Now! The unit is in place. The divers are returning, master. They must wait at a safe distance while we irradiate. When the Man-Fish has reached full proportions, have them bring it here, understand? Are you ready, Igor? Now! Look Igor! We've done it! We've done it! That's enough, Igor. Get it under control. - Have the wet mattress at the ready, Igor. - It will be, Master. Take him to room C-102. -Igor, secure him to the wet mattress with straps, and deny access to that compartment. Yes Master. You know, Igor, I want to begin the second phase of my project. As soon as possible! What will be the second phase, Master? The creation of a Woman-Fish! And I have no need to tell you...who she will be. You killed him, damn you! Die! Die! Now you will die! - Die! Die! What are you doing, you imbecile! Give me that! You imbecile! By pure luck it still lives! Not much movement on the yacht, Mario. I think it's the right moment to investigate. You never give up, do you? Never. Besides, Dr. Williams is the only clue we have. Master, come here.., Look! Do you want me to go with you? No need, call me with this device, at any signs of a boat leaving the yacht, or any other signs of danger, agreed? Agreed, take care. That can only be the Bat Woman! She evaded us before, but now, her time has come! - What's are you planning? - Come with me. I will set Pisces free, he will bring her to me, and I shall turn her into a Woman-Fish! Listen to me well, Pisces, I want you to capture the woman that is swimming out there, understand? Capture her! She will be your mate, it is the destiny I have prepared for her! If you fail, then this shall be your punishment! That is enough, Igor, connect the escape duct to the sea. She has lit an underwater flare, she will burn him! She is escaping, Master, Pisces is afraid of fire! The flare has burned out. The monster is after me! - But what monster? - Dr. Williams plaything! -What are you saying? -There it is! It's going to flip over the boat. The Police will think it's an accident. Damn it! He's lit the gasoline. They are getting away, Igor, they are getting away! It is truly incredible, I still cannot explain what kind of strange creature that was. I hope now you believe me when I say that I saw a Man-Fish, identical to that one, in Dr. Williams laboratory. Agreed. but you told me that specimen was much smaller than the one we saw. That is true, but one can suppose that if Dr. Williams can make a small creature, he can also make a larger one, right? In any case, the time for action, is now. I will advise the Inspector, so that with a group of agents, he seizes the boat. And what will you tell them? That you saw a creature with human features and the body of a fish? No one will believe you, Mario. That is true. I believe we have no other choice, but to continue with our investigation. That is it, Igor, that is it! This time we cannot fail! Igor, this device, when attached to a fabric , will emit. Ultrasonic sound waves, that Pisces will detect on the microscopic remote control we inserted in the auditory lobe of his brain. Number 1 will attach it to that woman's cape, and after that, it will be easy to locate her. It will be precisely Pisces who will bring her to me, and then, my vengeance will be terrible, TERRIBLE! - And the policeman? - He will share the same fate. Then, we will go to another country to gather more donors, we shall make a dozen. Hundreds of fish-men, who will give us absolute control of the world's oceans! (Diabolical evil science laughter) Today's lottery, today's, the lucky one, its today's lucky one. Today's, today's, please, just this one ticket is the lucky one, right! Home at last, would you like a drink, Mario? - A magnificent idea! - Can you prepare it while I change? We'll wait till midnight to release Pisces. What are you looking for? - A blanket. - For what? I am staying here tonight, I do not believe it is prudent to leave you alone after what has happened. - Mario.., please. - Do not argue. OK The sound has stopped. The emitter must be wet. That can only mean Pisces has entered the ocean with her. Now, we'll force him to return. Activate it! It is urgent that I have that woman in my grasp! Mario, Mario, can you hear me? Mario, answer me! -And the monster? - it is gone, It went back to the sea. -It was sheer luck we have escaped that horrible creature - And to think it was all my fault. - What do you mean? - It was a radio transmitter someone attached to my cape. I thought it was intended to give away my location to our enemies, but I was wrong. I never imagined it would attract the monster to us! - I'm so sorry Mario. - Don't worry, the important thing is that we're safe now. Come, let's go. No! I cannot explain how Pisces could have failed! He was to bring me that miserable woman... And he failed! - Why? everything was planned perfectly. - Something went wrong master. Yes, that is quite obvious, but I cannot understand what. - We must capture her at all costs -Yes. -That woman represents a great danger to us. The important thing is to find a way of accomplishing it. - Wait! She works in strict collaboration with Agent Robles. - True. Surely, if we capture him...she will try to rescue him! But...then...when she searches for him... We...yes!...It offers many probabilities of success! It is worth it to try! -Look! -Looks like an accident. Let's go. Hands up! What's all this then? Frisk them. Don't move! What do you want? - Take them. - Where? What does it matter, move it! Move! Put them inside. We have Captain Robles and the inspector. If you want to see them alive again, do not call the police. Go to the yacht you already know by your self, remember, if you do not follow these instructions, Your friends will be killed without hesitation. Do forgive the uncomfortable accommodations, gentlemen, but I can assure you, as soon as your girlfriend arrives, your suffering will end. And you think she will try to rescue us? Of course, from what I have been told, she has done so before. Why should she change now? - Is everything prepared, Igor? - Yes, master. As you can see, Captain, we are prepared to receive your savoriness with distinction. Don't move! We have Bat Woman, master. They're bringing her here now. Magnificent! Do you see how I was not mistaken? At last! At last! she is within my grasp! - Are you sure she was alone? - Yes, master. Excellent! Gentlemen, you have been a great problem for me, interfering with my experiments. In spite of that, I have decided to use your pitiful lives, for a grand destiny. Behold! The pineal fluid from your bodies, will be used to create two new beings. Like the one you see here. Whom I've have baptized, as "Pisces." And you , you damned woman, who turned me into a monster, I shall create the first amphibian monster! Move! Bring her to the operating table. You are a fool! Are you not aware that you have been defeated, and it is pointless to resist! Let's go! We'll operate immediately, Igor. It will be interesting to see if a woman can survive such a surgical procedure. And the pineal fluid, is replaces without causing death. Until now, no man has survived it, but perhaps, the female gender is more suitable, for carrying out this experiment. There are many biological reasons. - You're crazy! - Perhaps, but after all , only a thin line separated insanity from true genius. Everything is ready, Master - Number one, have your men stand guard. - Come with me. - Anesthetics? - Pentothal, then Cyclopropane. You are the first strangers to have the honor of witnessing, the surgical procedure. That creates transmutation, by the transplantation of pineal fluid from a human, to a fish. The great moment is at hand. You will pass on to posterity, along with my name! I fear I shall have to uncover your secret identity. I would be lying if I said I did not want to know who is, that enigmatic woman, Who, being so clever, was captured so easily, Igor, remove her mask. Stop, Pisces, stop! I command it! Igor, Igor! Do something! Igor! We must get out of here fast, Mario. This yacht will explode into a thousand pieces! Let's go! What I do not understand, is how the monster could have arrived just at the right moment to save your lives? Divine providence, maybe? -Sorry to contradict you, Tony, but providence did not intervene in the slightest. -what are you saying? - What do you mean? - Remember the small transmitter they attached to my cape that night? Of Course. Well, I decided to take it to the yacht when I found out about the abduction. And when the Man-Fish arrived, I understood that the transmitter was intended to single out a person for destruction. - And if you were wrong? - We would all be dead now. Pretty simple, isn't it? - A mouse! - What's going on? - There's a mouse over there, boys! Kill it, please! There is a mouse over there, please, kill it! Its horrible, kill it please! - Women eh? - Women! Subtitles by Jose Jimenez 06/08/2014
