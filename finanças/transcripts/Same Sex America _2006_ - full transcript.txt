(Child) First I'm going to church. And then, I'm going to-- I'm going to the wedding. And then, I don't know what else. Give US some beefcake! (Man) Come on! (Woman) Are you wearing that? You bitches know we all would've gotten over there and someone would have said, "where are the rings?" "Where are the rings? Corey, did you bring the rings?" Don't take it all off. Well, I don't think you need it. You know I don't like you with lipstick, darling. Well, some of US are butch dykes and some of US aren't. (Woman) Make sure that we have your medical certificates. This is what you do in emergencies when the moths eat your clothes. Look Mary, our fingers, they're empty. (Mary) Our bare fingers. We're gonna have another ring. Yeah, you shouldn't wear these. I feel like I'm doing a Broadway play or something, you know? In front of all these people. But they're all my really good friends. And I'm telling myself that. It's the band that goes with mine now. How do they function with-- [chuckles] [Cellist plays here comes the bride] Very important. I love marriage. You know, god said that we are-- if we do all that he says, we will be his bride in heaven. And I want to be that bride. I want to be that glorious person. I want that so badly. I think there is-- marybeth isn't here yet. She had two she was bringing. And I'm also expecting-- 'cause I can't wait forever, we gotta get going. Who's the other one? Judy. Man was made to deposit the seed of life. And woman was made to receive--that seed. And out of which comes the fruit of their love, a baby. A human being. And that's the way god said to, you know, to multiply everybody on the earth, you know? And so that's what I believe so much in that-- to stand up for the first time. [Laughing] From the days of Adam and Eve and throughout all salvation history marriage has been the union the sacred union of only one man and one woman. I've been afraid... Of people's anger. Now I cannot not stand up for what I believe. And I don't have hate. I saw a television program where a lesbian was saying "oh, how they hate US!" I don't hate them. We're all children of god. I just want to do it the way god does it. If you have not been involved in politics before you have to be involved now. God is calling on US, and I don't care if people don't like god. God is calling on US at this time of crisis to stand up and be counted. (Reporter) In about a half an hour, a constitutional convention is set to convene in Massachusetts to consider a ban on gay marriage, among other issues. (Reporter #2) Boston police tell me they are prepared to shut down the streets around the state capital if necessary anticipating thousands of demonstrators out here both for and against gay marriage. It's a civil rights issue! (Reporter #3) President bush is planning to endorse an amendment to the u.S. Constitution that would also define marriage as the union of a man and a woman. (Man) Was civil rights taken away when we took away slavery? Did slavery take away civil rights? He's saying "let the bigots vote." That says a lot about them not about US. Amen! Amen! Amen! [Crowd chanting] May god bless all of you. God bless all of you. (Byron rushing) We have, in Massachusetts right now, marriage open to everyone regardless of gender. That happened in November. That is right now! [Crowd roars] The goal for US is to persuade all the legislators in this building not to turn back the clock! Not to turn back the clock! (Man) They did not change the rule. It's about marriage, what marriage is. If you open the door to this you have to allow for incest. You have to allow for polygamy. You have to allow for anybody, to marry anybody they want. --And vote yes for this amendment. Keeping marriage between one man and one woman. (Elaine) I have a brother who is homosexual. So, I don't have any hate. I have all love for god's children to have the best we can-- he can give US. You know, growing up you dream about getting married. You do, I think it's every child's dream. You know? And it's like-- (cameraman) Thinking about a wedding and... Yeah! You think about the wedding. And all the people gathering together and, you know, just a big celebration and the amounts of love. It's something I've always dreamt about, you know. And then, I kinda put it on the back shelf. So I said, "it's never gonna happen, not in this world." (Cameraman) And now? And now, I'm like-- it's gonna happen, you know, it's gonna happen. Whether people like it or not. You know, we're equal. (Woman) "D" for dotreve. 'Cause that's going to be our last name. Dotreve, that's my last name. A long time ago I asked Natalie to marry me, and she said, "no." [Laughing] But I knew it was fate. But then, when did I ask you to marry me? Wait, I bought her a diamond necklace. And I gave it back to the store, too 'cause I was pissed. So tell 'em. The next year we went to venice and Natalie asked me to marry her. But we decided that-- Natalie didn't want a public ceremony. I don't know, she didn't want a ceremony so I did, so we fought about that for a few years and then we dropped it. She really wanted to have a traditional wedding and I really thought about it 'cause you know at first, I really didn't. But I thought, "well, you know, it's okay to do that, you know." And so that's what she wants. And now I'm kind of getting into it. I hate to admit it but-- we're ready. Oh my god! The shoes. Wow! You're beautiful. They're awesome! Now this has-- this is what we get. [Crowd chanting] (Woman) Tony and partner. Ahhh! (Man) She didn't think of that. She didn't think about anybody changing their names. I didn't think anyone would change and so-- at first I thought it was a joke. I said, "are you changing your name?" (Woman) I just never assumed anybody would change their name. (Man) Right, well it's new to everybody. Exactly, so you don't think of that. The cheese is out there. The wine is out there. Get out of my kitchen. (Woman) I had suspected for a long time. Had you really? Oh, I had. I had suspected since he was a young teenager. But then he got married. So that threw me a curve. So I said, "oh no, I'm wrong." You know, I mean he got married. And he had Kayla. Can Brianna-- Brianna. Can she sleep over by any chance? Brianna, the one you like. Either come over or sleep over. You're gonna have to talk with the parents. Okay. She's good! That's fine, but I just need to talk to her mother. Yeah, but he has to talk to you mom, or your dad. He can talk to your dad. --May 17th, you can be issued marriage licenses. (Men together) Right. And that's where were going, we're going to get our license on may 17th. Just to make sure we have everything in place. Even though, we're hoping nothing-- the conservative town of Holden will forever go down in history (woman) I know. As having an interracial gay couple getting a marriage license. [Laughing] I gotta love that. Brianna has you hanging on her wall. (Man) She does? And you. I open the door, I was like, "that's my dad." She's like, "I thought it was pretty cool, he was in the paper." I was like, "okay." Nice. 11 and 19. (Paul) So we're gonna get our license on may 18th. (Sara) Is there gonna be a big cake? There's gonna be a big cake we hope, yeah. Like one big one and then the medium-- oh! You mean like a wedding cake? Yeah! Yeah. Well, we actually haven't talked about that. Would you like to have a wedding cake? Yeah? Yeah! Can you help daddy pick it out? Yeah. Okay. Are you gonna be on top of the wedding cake? You know how they have little-- people? They usually have a bride and a groom. No, uh-- should we have a daddy and a poppa and a Matthew and a Sara? [Laughing] (Cameraman) Where are you from? China. (Paul) No way, really? Did you walk here? No, you adopted me. Right. How old were you? Do you remember? Yeah. How old? I think three. You're right. And who went to China to get you? Daddy and poppa. Both of US, right. (Paul) Yeah, Matthew was adopted first and he was also three years old. So it was two years before Sarah. And Jon went to Russia to get him. Where did you stay? (Paul) Oh, you mean when poppa went to Russia? Yeah. They were awake when I was going to sleep and I couldn't sleep at night because I knew the time I was going to bed, Jon was actually in court adopting Matthew. And I couldn't sleep and I was nervous. And then in the middle of the night he called me by telephone and told me that he adopted Matthew. And do you know Matthew said his first words to me was, "hi, daddy." On the phone from Russia. And I cried and cried. (George w. Bush) After more than two centuries of American jurisprudence and a millennia of human experience, a few judges and local authorities are presuming to change the most fundamental institution of civilization. Impeach the judges! We all have to be accountable. We're not going to let them get away with it. Their actions have created confusion on an issue that requires clarity. This court case is like the shot that was heard 'round the world. You have legislatures across this country reinforcing marriage because of four judges UN-elected judges in this state. [Crowd chanting] (Commentator) Four judges in Massachusetts, arrogant in their black robes should not be allowed to force gay marriage on this country. The people need to be able to vote on this issue. And we need to think about changing the way these judges are appointed. Let the people vote! Let the people vote! [Continues chanting] One thing I was thinking, if Massachusetts is turned there are 37 states right now for one man, one woman. Think of the chaos that would result. Across the country. (Reporter) For the second time in a week conservatives have been turned back in their efforts to keep San Francisco from granting any more marriage licenses to same sex couples. Well tonight, a judge there once again refused to issue a temporary restraining order against the city. Meanwhile, the same sex marriage movement has officially made its way to new Mexico. (Reporter 2) No more same sex weddings in asbury park, New Jersey. At least for now. (Reporter 3) New York's Attorney General has already indicated that there is no legal authority to issue marriage licenses-- (Laurie) What bothers me is being called a "bigot" and these vile names because I have certain beliefs. I don't do that to them, I'm not callin' them. I said the practice of anal-- the practice is what is offensive. And to call it marriage offends me deeply. As human beings, on that level they don't offend me. They're just people like you and me going to work, doing their job, whatever. (Reporter #3) They've tried to go to court in Oregon and blocked them where some 1700 marriage licenses have already been issued. But, there's a big difference between tolerance and full acceptance. And we're being asked to accept something that we know is bad for society and bad for our children. So, that's the bottom line. (George w. Bush) I have consistently stated that if we support law to protect marriage between a man and a woman. And obviously these events are influencing my decision. What sin is worth going to hell for? Nothing people, it's wrong! It doesn't fit, people. It's wrong! It doesn't reproduce life, it's wrong! It produces death, it's wrong! Look at the suicide rates. [Low bark] Then they're all coming. (Cameraman) Oh, yeah? Oh yeah. They're coming. People in this house. People in this house. The people in that house. There's a couple of gay guys lives in this house. First of all, I never thought I was going to be a lesbian. I was married for 23 years. That's kind of a long time. And I have three wonderful children and three granddaughters. So I didn't come out until I was 45. This finger is now empty. It used to have a ring on it, which I had resized and moved my rings around here so that I could keep this finger empty. Because we've ordered our rings from provincetown. And this is ready for my wedding ring. We don't walk around town holding hands. We might after we get married, we will. I walk downtown holding hands in provincetown but I wouldn't walk down the streets in maynard holding hands and all of a sudden, today I feel that I can do that. [Chanting] Equal rights! Equal rights! (Corey) And we had to talk about that a lot. We had some very serious discussions about, "you know that this is forever, right?" There's a kid involved now. So we had to make sure we were okay with all of that before--before we went anywhere with the adoption. (Cameraman) Were you both basically long-term relationship people before this? No. Tricks. I like tricks. No. His real first relationship was 12 years long. I married a straight boy-- not married, I was with a straight guy for 12 years, (cameraman) What? Yeah, my first relationship was with a guy that I knew he was straight. He'd always said, "if I weren't with you, I'd be with a woman." Like, "okay, that's cool." And we were together for 12 years. And he's married with kids now. And his name is-- no. [Laughs] Kidding. -That'd be great. -Can you imagine? He'd be upset. I like being with someone, I was never good by myself. I think some people are. You know, I think some people are very good by themselves. They don't mind being alone. It's just not the way that I ever really saw myself. See, I, on the other hand, even though I've been in long-term relationships, I've definitely come to the conclusion that if this relationship doesn't work out I do not see myself in another relationship. I just don't, I don't see it. I really like being by myself. I like having a bed to myself. I like opening the door at night and walking in and saying hello and no one answers. Whereas, I know that if something, as unlikely as it is, if it just didn't work out for whatever reason, I'm sure that there'll be somebody else. But-- you know-- [chuckling] Here's our article. Here's US, really big. Like a really ridiculously big picture. They wrote, "to get a license rechoran and karno "will likely have to fib about where they live, "possibly giving the address of the resort where they are getting married may 22nd." I mean that is like-- that's completely not true. We would not perjure ourselves to get this license. You can change. (Man) One man, one woman. It's not his future that's being affected, it's ours. It's US who are going to be affected by this amendment if it doesn't get passed. It is our country. It's up to US to decide this. They say that it's for the children that this right can't be passed. But it's US who want it to be passed. (Mary bonauto) Tomorrow's vote is a real civil rights moment in this state. And the simple question is do our legislators stand for discrimination in our constitution or do they stand against it? It is simply that easy and that simple. [Cheering] We're here to let our representatives know that we want them to oppose this constitutional amendment. This is our lives, these are our lives. This is not some abstract principal. This is our lives you're talking about. While we're standing here right now, the house, under the leadership of the speaker, is going to try and thwart the process by passing a civil unions bill that will deny US the right to civil marriage licenses come may. And so, hopefully-- [jeering] And what our opponents don't seem to understand is this: They can try as they will to take our rights away, but we're a people who are determined we have friends who are determined. And we are a people with friends who are going to keep coming back, year after year, after year, after year. [Cheering] My name is Phoebe and this is mama. Right, mama? Yes. Look, I thought-- I never ever thought that there would be the possibility of civil unions, much less marriage, in my lifetime. Nobody thought it. I think there will be a backlash. I absolutely think there'll be a backlash. I don't think there'll be a constitutional amendment here, in the long run. And I don't think there'll be a federal constitutional amendment. I don't think it will go through. I don't think they'll get-- I mean because the founders of this country, and the people who wrote the constitution were so brilliant. Here I go, this is my legal hat. Here, I'll put on my legal hat. They were so brilliant because they knew that it's a real-- if this is something that is fundamental to how we live as a country, right, and what this country stands for-- freedom and freedom of expression and freedom of religion and from religion, you can't have it be easy to change the constitution. You have to make it really hard. (Robin) We've had these rings for-- (Audrey) For nine years. And we wear these. Yeah, pretty much non-stop. When our relationship has been really bad we did not wear them. I think these rings-- mean a lot. Yeah, I mean mine's-- the stone on mine is falling apart. (Audrey) So, I think it's a big decision to get married. I agree with Robin, it's a big decision. And we've only been together almost ten years. You have to take this thing seriously. You have to take your time. (Brian camenker) The facts of changing the marriage laws and the enforcement of legalizing same-sex relationships in the schools, in society, with benefits, turns society around in many, many ways. And even the opinion of the court admitted that. It admitted that this is going to turn society almost inside out. [Applause] Excuse me. Are you homophobic? (Mr. Camenker) Yeah. Are you? Well, you should be ashamed. You should be ashamed of yourself. Ladies and gentlemen, this is where it all begins. This is where your tax dollars are going. And we're not going to be intimidated. [Applause] (Woman) The courts did their job. It's the job of the courts to make determination about what it and isn't constitutional. So the supreme judicial court of Massachusetts did precisely what they were supposed to. Every major civil rights decision in this nation made by the courts have been split decisions, including the laws that banned interracial marriage. Those were split decisions, too. And had those questions gone to the ballot, those interracial marriage bans would still be on the books today in many states across this nation. This is very similar to what happened many decades ago about interracial marriage couples. (Singing amazing grace) I once was lost but now I'm found [chanting] It's not about property, it's all about children. It's not about property, it's all about children. One mother, one father. Honor your mother, honor your father. This law breaks all commandments. One mother, one father. Where's my mother? Where's my father? I feel sick to my stomach. I feel like the whole world as I've known it is gone. I just feel like sanity does not reign anymore. That this is--i think we're living in a really sick society. And I don't think people know the pandora's box they're opening. They don't understand what all this is going to do, once this starts getting in your schools. Because they're going to be saying to these kids, "oh no, homosexuality is the same as heterosexuality." You're going to see these kids experimenting with, you know, woman on woman, men on men. It's going to be a nightmare. Sodom and gomorrah in Massachusetts. This is wrong, in Massachusetts they want to marry a man with a man. How sick can you get and still breathe! My parents are here. I didn't realize they were going to be here. And they're actually on the other side. (Cameraman) Where are they? I couldn't locate them. When I first came in I saw them, and I gave my mom a hug. And I stood next to her. I love my parents dearly. They love me dearly. We're just-- we're on opposite sides, and it breaks my heart. Amazing grace how sweet-- I got to fight for what's right. I've got to stick to my beliefs, you know, not just for myself but for all the people. You know, it's not just for me, it's for everybody. You know, it's all the children. It's like, god made me too. God made me in his image. You know, so why is it so wrong? It's not wrong. It is not wrong. It is not wrong. (Man singing amazing grace) Was blind but now I see defend our constitution we shall not be moved defend our constitution we shall not be moved like a tree that's planted by the water we shall not be moved give US equal coverage we shall not be moved give US equal coverage we shall not be moved (Cameraman) Going home? Have a safe trip. (Modern pop version) Amazing grace how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me I once was lost but now I'm found I was blind but now I see 'twas grace that taught my heart to fear and grace my fears today is-- the constitutional convention is reconvening again today to discuss the compromise, you know, to try to pass this amendment. And, of course, we're trying to prevent the amendment from being passed. We don't want to amend the constitution. Leave the constitution alone. [Chanting] Equal rights! Equal rights! Are you also getting married? We're getting married July 31st. July 31st? We're June 19th. How long have you been together? We've been together, 17 years. We've been together, 14 years. [Crowd chanting] Thank you, thank you, thank you. [Applause] (Arline issacson) 20 years ago when almost every gay legislative aide in this building was closeted, they used to be terrified if they knew that I knew about them. They used to be terrified of getting a call from me when I was lobbying the gay-lesbian civil rights bill. And so I had to use a fake name, you know, because if arline isaacson left a message, that might implicate them. And so I'd call and if I couldn't get through to them directly, I'd say, my code name was Sally. "Hi, would you tell them Sally called." Welcome to being an American. For me it's all about-- it's about time. Too many conservatives just sit back on their haunches and be conservative. And that's kind of the way a lot of US are by nature. But if no one speaks up then nothing will ever be done. We've a real consciousness, many of US, of the fact that we are in the middle of making history, or participating in the making of history. Win, lose or draw, history is going to be made in this state. And is being made in this state. I often build that in to my conversations with certain legislators because as they struggle with the issues of how they're going to vote on gay marriage and what are they going to do about the constitutional amendment, I try and remind them to think not simply in the moment. Don't think up to the next election. But project yourself, astroproject yourself, project yourself ten years ahead. And turn around and look back at yourself and what are you going to see? And what are you going to say? And how you going to feel and what are you going to think? And what you going to tell your kids, or your grandchildren? That they are, no matter how much, how painful it might be right now for the more conservative ones to either support gay marriage or at least to not oppose it, to not take our rights away, they need to understand that they are going to be judged not simply by tomorrow's voter as in this election but, by history. And they have to decide each and every one of them, and the governor too mitt romney has to decide does he want to be Orville faubus standing in the schoolhouse door with his arms crossed saying, "you can't come in" and right now, that's the role romney's playing. And that's the role many of our opponents are playing. And I don't think some of them get it. (Reporter) Massachusetts legislators have taken the first step in a lengthy process that could ban gay men and lesbians from marrying. [Applause] (Peter gomes) Now let me in this great house say a word about Massachusetts. Because there are people constantly complaining that Massachusetts is out of the mainstream. We are not like everybody else. Somehow we are uniquely different. Thank god we are. [Cheering] I do not wish to take my social signals from Mississippi or Georgia or Alabama. Or for that matter, or California or even Virginia. Or Texas, praise god. We, after all, have the mayflower compact. We have John winthrop and his vision set on a hill. We have John Adams and the oldest constitution in the world. Why should we yield to the sentiments of main street or the mainstream? We set the mainstream. We don't follow it. Hello. Yeah, they're voting right now. Roll call. The clerk will call the roll. Stephen a. Baddour. No. Jarrett t. Barrios. (Barrios) No. No. Fredrick e. Berry. (Berry) No. No. Robert a. Havern. (Havern) No. No. Robert. L. Hedlan. (Hedlan) Yes. Brian. A. Joyce. It is not about polygamy. It is not about special rights. It is not about the defense or definition of marriage. It is not about the future shape of the family. It is not about hearing the voice of the people. It is not about the judiciary. It is not about religion. Yours or mine or the absence thereof. It is about nothing more and nothing less than civil rights. [Applause] Robert a. Havern. (Havern) No. No. Robert l. Hedland. Yes. Robert s. Creedon Jr. Cynthia stone creem. No. Susan c. Fargo. David p. Magnani. No. Thomas m. McGee. No. Linda j. Melconian. Through this amendment just say no. [Cheering, applause] Clerk will call the chair. Robert e. Travaglini. No. (Clerk) 105 votes in the affirmative. 92 in the negative. (Crowd) Oh god. (Clerk) This institution convention will be in brief recess. (Man) May 17th still happens. It's not over. (Woman) This just means that in 2005 they're going to put this up again and they still they're--thank god they still have a lot to go through to make this, to put this on the constitution, so... I mean we knew it was going to be an uphill-- it is disappointing, and it's going to be an uphill battle. And we knew that. We're just going to have to just, keep on trucking. It's like your whole life you feel really discriminated against and then you finally get to a place where you feel so much better. And then this comes up and it brings up all that same feeling again because you, you really see people who really hate you for just, for something they don't even know about you. That's what makes it hard. Well, we're still going to get married. (Cameraman) Good for you. We're still going to get married. And I think all of US people that get married are just going to change this. It makes me sad. (Reporter) For those fighting to protect traditional marriages it is a partial victory. (Ron crews) At least we have the legislature on record now as preserving marriages one man and one woman. (Reporter) But for same sex couples fighting to hold onto their court mandated marriage rights, there is shock. (Arline issacson) It's clearly disappointing. (Reporter) And defiance. (Mary bonauto) The inescapable truth is that there is equality in this constitution and we are all equal. And there is nothing any legislator is going to do in the end to take that away from US. It is just true! [Crowd roars] (Woman) Mom? Mom? Hi, sweetheart. All right, mother. (Father) Yeah, again as you well know, we love you, you're our daughter no matter what. You know, that's life. (Daughter) Yeah, I mean I really love my family I really-- (mother) Absolutely. You know, I want to be part of my family. And I want to be accepted as equal. What's it going to do if, if we are able to get married? You know, what problems is it going to cause you? Why would you be against it if it's not going to cause you any problems? You know, I mean I believe in god, dad. God loves me too. (Father) We've already discussed that. I still have a belief that, you know, what I believe. You know, but again I have to accept what's going on in this world, especially with my own daughter. You know, and if that's where she's at-- (mother) It scares me. You know it scares-- it scares-- (daughter) What scares you? I just, well because of these stupid other people who have different thinkings. And I guess that scares me. We don't ever want anything to happen to you. Right, so you don't want me to have rights because it scares you? [Laughing] We can't lie for our beliefs, though. That's the only thing. Yeah, you know, so. It's just how we feel. So again it opens up these communication, like I say, channels. And allow US to you know, openly discuss this a little more. So first of all it'll help you to feel a lot better. You know, what you feel and do, and so on type of thing. (Daughter) Who I am. Yeah, who you are. And that's fine. It's just that you can't expect me to go out to fight for your rights in that sense. Okay, I mean, you know, that's kind-- I can expect you to sit back on your couch for yours. (Sara) Daddy, did you get down on one knee and hold a ring, daddy? (Paul) No, actually I asked him over dinner in a Chinese restaurant. And he said, "yes." And then we didn't get rings until like three years later, Sara. After we moved to Boston. And you know where we exchanged rings? On a beach in provincetown. With all of our friends around. And it was in the middle of the winter. Oh my gosh. And it was freezing cold. And we stood on the beach and we still have a picture today of that. Daddy? Do you want to see-- you saw my ring, right? Yeah. Daddy-- did you know, Sara, that I wear my ring on my right hand? Remember you asked about that? And I said usually people wear them on the left hand on their ring finger. But daddy and poppa wear ours on the right because we couldn't get legally married yet. When can I wear in your next wedding date? That's a good question. That's a part of the planning. We have to get you a nice dress. Will you help pick it out? Yeah. Okay. Well, we have to find a nice dress-- how many, how many days until you're-- before we get married? Yeah. It's like 55 days. That's not so bad. No, not so bad. Jesus Christ is risen today h-a-l-l-elujah I didn't think that there was any hatred on our side, but I guess people are people, and everybody is not the same. And I'm told that there are, there is hatred on my side and I thought it was all on their side. And they think it's all on our side that we all hate too. But it's all by perception. I had one wonderful thing happen to me, one touching thing. On the second trip. As I was going by they had like, they left US like this much for a corridor to walk in and as we were walking down with our signs you know, we just kind of looked straight ahead or so. But there was one young woman who looked me in the eye and she put her hand out. And I just was so touched because--so then I just shook her hand and it was showed like, "yeah, we have principles but we don't have to have hatred across the line." (Cameraman) This was a gay activist, who did this? Mm. Yeah. Singing hallelujah [phone ringing] Hello. Christian? Hi, how are you? Good. Do you want to head down here? And we'll do the pond. Okay. We'll be here. Okay, bye. We always make her fall asleep on her own at night. But now I sort of like hold her to fall asleep for naps. I guess when I was younger I used to-- people are always-- I used to always say, "well, I'm gay, but it's not about having gay sex." Right. Like to me homosexuality is a definition. It wasn't all about the sex. It definitely isn't about the sex. [Laughing] You be careful what you say on TV. Sorry. I always thought it was about being different and thinking about things differently, and being outside of the conventions and the traditions. And then somehow that we end up getting married. Getting married, having two kids and living in the suburbs. Yeah, but we had them out of wedlock. Doesn't that help at all? (Audrey) So Phoebe, before mommy and I could not get married. Even if we wanted to. No two moms and two dads could get married 'cause it was against the rules. You weren't allowed to do it. If you went to go get married they would say, "no, you can't do that." Because you're not-- because marriage is only for one man and one woman, not two women and not two men. Don't get to do it. And now that's different. It changed. What do you think about that? 'Cause now you guys can get married and you guys didn't get married yet. Well that's a good point. I keep saying you should get married. You do? And you guys don't. Well that's a big thing to plan, honey. It's a big thing to plan. Then plan it right now. What do you think is involved in planning? What shall we plan? Phoebe. How about you plan it? (David rushford) Oh, we expect a brisk business for at least the first week. We're going to essentially convert all of our windows that serve the public to accept marriage applications. "Filing marriage intentions" is the correct term. (Cameraman) Have you had to train your people differently for gay marriages? Oh no, absolutely not. Change the forms? No, the s.J.C. Decision essentially says that separate is never equal. So there will be no change of process. There doesn't need to be a change of process. Doesn't it say "man and woman" or "husband and wife"? That's only two words on a form. There's not retraining needed for that. Perhaps in phonetics. (Mr. Rushford) There are actually four forms. There's the marriage intention and then there's a supplement. The actual form is currently labeled "groom and bride." Essentially these will become gender neutral on may 17, and they will say "spouse one and spouse two." (Cameraman) And what's your position on same sex marriages? How do you feel? Well a local clerk is not-- we're not a legislator, so we don't essentially take a stand. I just mean personally. Well, we don't answer questions personally about it. And that's not going to happen. [Blowing raspberries] How can we determine what he's going to call US? I think it's going to be something where he sort of figures out what to call US and it'll come naturally. I just don't think-- you know, to say, "you will call me pappa." What are you saying over there? Oh my god. Michael just said, "top and bottom." You will refer to me as "top." Don't think that's funny. So I think it's one of those things where he'll just sort of figure out. And we'll know if he calls me "dadda" or "dad" or "pop" or whatever. We'll figure that out. Do you want to call me dadda? Dadda. Thank you. I can't believe it's only a few days away now. (Cameraman) How are you feeling? Umm-- (man) Why did you leave the back open? Oh, I forgot. (Cameraman) Are you getting nervous about the wedding? Or the license? No, no, I'm just-- I'm just, like everyday you hear new stuff. And I don't think they can do anything to prevent may 17th from happening, but, I mean, I've been surprised before, so. --Mr. Taylor. (Girl) There's always other pressure in coming in. (Driver) So the unsuspecting freshman. (Passenger) Yeah. (Reporter) The legal right of same sex couples in the state to exchange vows now appears to be just a weekend away. This is interesting what they say about syphilis. "May a person with communicable syphilis obtain a marriage license?" And the answer is, "no." Not until you're treated, that's why they test you. Just in case, you might have syphilis. Just relax your hand for me. I'm good. I'm tough. (Partner) Yeah, who's holding a rabbit? I got the rabbit by the throat. (Nurse) Can you relax your hand for me please? Relax your hand from the throat of the rabbit. I still haven't talked to my father either. Really? Yeah. Ever since he called to tell me it was his birthday. And that he's got an issue with the gay marriage, but he doesn't know what that issue is or why he has it. And that's why he hasn't called or commented on the fact that we've been all over the news and everything. Just for some reason he's got an issue. Getting the name changed. But he doesn't even know that. We haven't spoken enough to even, discuss that. He's just kind of off in his own world. He doesn't get heated. And we don't have any heated arguments or anything. Like al's family. It's just kind of like you said, "don't talk about anything important." [Laughing] And you identify with him. Yeah. So I don't know where he is on the issue, lately. I think that you should feel overwhelmingly in love when you get married. That's part of like the image of a wedding is feeling that way. It's not the ritual or the paper or the anything. It's the feeling of "wow", like it's a wonderful feeling. And we've had a lot of struggles. And it's sort of like if I'm going to do a wedding, if I'm going to get married, I'm going to do it feeling sappy and like, overflowing and all of those sort of gushy kind of words that go with a wedding to me. And we've had a lot of struggles, and we're still having them, and they're not worked out. We're always going to have struggles. Well, I'm hoping that they lessen. They have lessened. Not enough. Oh man, tough crowd. You bet. Wooster is seen to be the city that it is: A welcoming community, a diverse community, and one that is prepared to receive large numbers of people. (Cameraman) Do you support same sex marriage? That is outside the perimeter of this interview. [Laughing] (News reporter) As Massachusetts prepares for a flood of same sex couples requesting marriage licenses, another drama's unfolding between town and city clerks and governor romney over a 1913 law that romney says prevents out-of-state couples from getting marriage licenses. (News reporter #2) --Limit marriage licenses to residents only. (Gov. Romney) We have to follow the law whether it's one we appreciate or not. (News reporter #3) Many of the town halls here in Massachusetts have indicated that they're willing to defy governor romney and issue licenses to out-of-state couples. Even in states where those marriages may not be recognized. Where is this other thought coming from that we're to become marriage police all of a sudden? And only for same sex couples. And only on residency. You can just drive over the bridge into Manhattan and take the f.D.R. Up. But instead of going there, which is stupid, you just keep taking it over to the major Deegan. What bridge is that over there? (Deborah) The Manhattan bridge. I knew that when I was little, actually, I had no idea boys were cute, and I would have to ask my best friend if they were cute. Periodically I would ask her, "do you think you're gay?" (Partner) Really? (Shelly) And I'd be like, "oh no, no." We had to keep testing, keep asking the questions. And she would always say, "no." But then one night she did come out and say, "oh by the way. [Giggling] "By the way I'm not a virgin. (Shelly) Yeah, yeah, that's right. And by the way I'm gay." (Partner) Wait, what? You started with, "by the way I'm not a virgin?" (Shelly) Well I don't think I just blurted it out like that. Yeah you did. (Partner) That must have been with a guy like before you came out. The first and last boy that Shelly ever suffered. (Shelly) I guess we were washing the dishes or something, and i-- I guess it was just like a little intimate moment where I felt like we hadn't been talking in a while. Just thought I'd tell you, catch you up on my life. And we had a good cry. And I assured you it wasn't your fault. But I don't think you believed me. You know, I just didn't know exactly what to feel. Yeah. But I do remember thinking that the one thing that I wouldn't be able to share with you is a wedding. Well there you go! Here we are! "If one or both of the wedding participants "reside outside Massachusetts, "they will be asked-- he/she/they will be asked "if they intend to live in Massachusetts after the wedding. "Intent is a plastic concept. "You can answer that question 'yes' honestly "if you intend to stay in Massachusetts "after the wedding. "Be it for a lifetime-- be it for an hour or a lifetime." That's ridiculous. No. I don't feel good about that. But we are going to be here for the wedding, obviously. I will seek a stay of the court's decision until the constitutional amendment process has run its course. Romney filed a bill to give him the extraordinary power of being able to single-handedly appoint an attorney, and he chose a former supreme judicial court justice named Joe nolam. He wants to be able to appoint him, send him to the s.J.C. To represent his opinion, and try and thwart the release of the marriage licenses on may 17th. I'd say it's been a roller coaster. I didn't get home 'til late last night, turned on my television, and I see that our governor is busy again. And I'm thinking of a bumper sticker that says "when all else fails try governing," like you know, like don't you have anything else to do? We have 100,000 postcards. They're addressed to the Attorney General Thomas Riley, and it says very nicely, "dear Attorney General Riley, "protect our Massachusetts constitution, "marriage and society. "Please seek and obtain "a stay of the supreme judicial court's goodridge decision "so that no marriage licenses are issued to same sex couples "until the people can vote on the constitutional amendment defining marriage as a union of one man and one woman." My heart goes out. I love-- there are so many homosexuals that I admire, that I think are excellent people. I can understand the desire for many people to have the same kind of legitimacy that other couples have. But the fact is, is that it is plain, it is wrong morally, it is wrong spiritually, it is wrong religiously, it is destructive to the foundations of society. So my liking them or not, my admiring them or not has nothing to do with the rightness or wrongness of the issue that they represent. The goal is this: We don't want to have a hearing on this bill before may 17th. (Cameraman) Do you know anybody personally who's planning on getting married? Any same sex couples? A couple. Yeah a few, sure. (Cameraman) I don't understand how that, how do you-- do they respect your-- no. [Laughing] No they don't. They don't even respect the disagreement which has been hard on me I have to tell you. Because they've been-- and they remain at least in my heart, dear friends and respected individuals. Their conduct here is just not something I embrace, but I still value their intellect, their friendship, but this has been an emotional issue, and it's kind of torn US away, and I probably won't get invited. So it is hard, it is hard. (Carron) My district predominantly Democratic in its party registration. But still, you know, kind of blue collar, traditional background. Traditional values. And I felt it was my obligation to bring that message forward. (Cameraman) What was the message you were getting from your constituents? It was overwhelming. This is the way the senators will be coming into the senate president's office and then into the senate. (Carron) I know there's the civil rights issue from the other side of the argument, too. And what I've tried to articulate as best I can to people is that-- that argument's never come through to me from the proponent side of same sex marriage. That is a civil rights violation not allowing it to happen. It hasn't come through? It hasn't come through to me. I mean, I've asked, and I've challenged people, "tell me the single individual civil liberties "that is being thwarted or denied anybody "because they're not allowed to fit under the definition of marriage as we've come to define it." And they're hard pressed. (Interviewer) What you going to do on may 17th when everybody goes-- god that's a good question. Do you have a plan? I'm thinking of being out of state 'cause I don't know if I could-- really? I definitely will move if that happens. I mean, I definitely, definitely will move. I'm thinking of it anyway. But I definitely will be moved. I probably can't get moved by may 17th, but I definitely would not live in this state. Oh my god, even if-- I've lived here all my life. I will move to Virginia because I've been doing my-- well, my son is down there. But I will move 'cause I can see that. I mean, I thought of Maryland. The senate killed the domestic the doma law. The defense of marriage law in Maryland so I'm not moving to Maryland. Forget it, I don't want to ever go through this again. Oh I wouldn't stay in a state that has such-- really? It's bad enough I have to live with supporting abortion. I would not-- no, I don't want to stay. Tom, here's Bob. (Traditional marriage supporters) I pledge allegiance to the flag. (Man) Join in pledging allegiance to the flag of the United States of america. (Senators) I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of america. And to the republic for which it stands one nation, under god indivisible with Liberty and justice for all. If you can find out. I will. Darling, what are they going to do? (Interviewer) How you feeling about Monday? Well, how can anybody feel about it? It's like the decline and fall of the Roman empire. Legalized perversion. Sorry to interrupt you before you go in the chambers. No. We'll talk more. Okay, thank you. It seems to me, unless I'm misunderstanding, there are very few hopes left before Monday. But not to mention the religious not to mention god-- (Ron gray) This trend is runaway judges. We must make them accountable. [Applause] Yes, say it. Say it. When those powers are drawn you do not have a rule of law. You have the tyranny of the judges. The tyranny of the judges, the tyranny of the judges. (Interviewer) What happened? You got it? It's done. [Cheering, applause] (News reporter) Tonight gay marriage in Massachusetts is a go. A federal judge rejected the last minute effort to block same sex ceremonies starting Monday. (Cory atkins) I want to thank you. I want to thank your parents who wrote to me and said, "finally my children can get married." I want to thank those of you who sent me pictures of your families. They're on my desk. And I want to thank you for making the Massachusetts constitution a living, breathing document for all of US here today. This is truly a moment in history. Thank you. [Applause] (News reporter) A little over five hours from now Massachusetts will become the first state to issue legal same sex marriage licenses. And gay couples are already lining up at city hall. Looking at two gentlemen here with lovely suits on. Then there's a woman here with a lovely-- how would you describe your outfit? What is-- -a Chinese jacket. -A Chinese jacket. I don't know if it's really hit me yet. When I walk out with that little piece of paper I'm going to be like, "whoa," you know what I mean? It's still-- I feel like I've been holding my breath and something's going to happen and it's not going to happen. (Paul) Took my ring off to get my finger ready and it feels very strange. And all morning I've been doing this and so we got our rings ready to go. Yeah. Itsy bitsy spider. We're ready to go. We asked each other hundreds of times, "do you want to get married? Want to get married?" Because it's just so exciting. It's not until-- you get so used to being-- officially married. To fighting and being shot down and everything all the time, that when it really happens it's kind of hard to internalize it. It's surreal. Yeah. Look, they're making the grounds all nice for our wedding. Do you realize that this is the last time we will be walking out of this house without the ability to get married? (Audrey) Well I already said when I tested the video camera when I fixed it, and I said, "testing." I said, "it's may 16th, it's six something. "In five hours and something minutes the special rights of heterosexuals will be over." Yeah! Oh my godlook at this. (News reporter) The crowd here has grown over the past several hours from several hundred to several thousand, and most of them cheering supporters of gay marriage filing into Cambridge city hall to apply for marriage licenses. You're getting married? Someday. US too, but not tonight. Yeah, we're going to wait. We're young. Yeah. It's good, it's good. It's good to wait. It's smart to wait and do it right. It's like legal, legal marriage. Like exactly the same. (Man) It is. Exactly the same. Isn't it incredible? Not civil disobedience. Real marriage. [Airhorn blows] [Crowd cheering] Like I'm proud of this moment like right now, right here. That doesn't mean I want to sing god bless america and pledge allegiance. This is more than a moment. This is a civil rights moment. It's not just for queer people. It's a civil rights moment. Right. And that's something to be proud of. Oh wo whoa! [Cheering, clapping] Oh, it's incredible. It's incredible. This is it, like, it's out now. You can't put it back in. And that part is so exciting. [Crowd cheering] We finally come to the realization that after 49 years, we're going to make it legal. (Audrey) No, it doesn't touch me, it just pisses me off that they have been together for 49 years they have had to put up with this shit. (Robin) They're all getting out now. That means it's getting close. It must be real close. (Woman #1) I'm waiting 'til midnight. I'm not leaving. (Woman #2) I am too, I'm waiting 'til people come out. (Woman) Are they not letting more people get married? (Robin) No that's it. They're full. They filled up the whole place. [Cheering, whistling] (News reporter) It's now the law in Massachusetts. It's the first state in the nation to legalize same sex marriage. (News reporter #2) The city clerk's office in Cambridge handed out the first marriage license applications to gay couples. That's the first couple over there. [Chanting] We are equal. We are equal. We are equal. [Chanting continues] (News reporter) It's now may 17th, the day same sex marriage becomes a reality. I'm a little nervous. I wish I'd put deodorant on. I don't know.His, do you think-- yeah, city clerk. That's where you go. The thing was unlocked. It's locked David. How are you? (Paul) Oh look who it is. (Jon) It's Michael, I've seen him already today. Now he's going to be taking my last name. So where on here if there's any name change? (Woman) Surname to be used afterwards. (Woman #2) You're keeping your names your last names? No, I'm changing my last name. I'm going to be cronin-swalvosky. (Woman) First question Massachusetts residents? We're not Massachusetts residents. Intending to reside-- we don't know where we're intending to reside yet. (News reporter) Governor mitt romney has said that he doesn't want Massachusetts to become the Las Vegas of gay marriage. We want to live in a state that gives US the benefits of being a legally married couple. This is where I resent how they've left it to US. It's because they've left it to US. Right. And the way I was going it handle it was I'm not asking for proof. Okay. We're hoping, since we love New York and we're from there, that New York will... Will get it together and be fine with it. If we're not getting those rights then we will move to Massachusetts. So under that circumstance if she wants US to write we intend to live in Massachusetts then we can write that. Oh, so this would actually be my second marriage. Yeah. What's the date of marriage? June. 12th. (Together) I have reviewed a list of impediments to marriage from my place of residence and I hereby state that there is-- here comes the bride all dressed in white where is the groom he's in the ladies room why is he there he forgot his underwear Best wishes to you. Thank you so much. We'll see you on Thursday. I just changed my name. (Girl) "Mrs. Tony." It's awesome. It's cool. Congratulations. Oh, thank you. This little piece of paper is the cause of so much consternation in this country. I know. This is going to cause society to crumble. Right here in my little hands. The destruction of society. And while it was a day for celebration, the fight is not over yet. One place these marriages definitely won't be recognized is at the federal level. President bush is trying to pass a constitutional amendment outlawing same sex marriages altogether. (George w. Bush) If we're to prevent the meaning of marriage from being changed forever. Our nation must enact a constitutional amendment to protect marriage in america. Sometimes you pray like right now. Even though you're feeling kind of dead inside. Do you know what I mean? Have you ever been in that? You pray and you-- then I look at the trees. I see them blooming. I see another day. And I think I'm going to see my son tomorrow. And I think he's getting married. And life is going to go on. It's going to be harder than it was, but it will go on. Never give up hope. Where there's life there's hope. Oh, hi ma. [Laughing] Oh your hands are always tight. (Wolf blitzer) The voting is now underway on the floor of the United States senate. At issue-- a constitutional amendment (female reporter) Can the constitution forbid gay or lesbian couples from marrying? President bush supports such a change. (Cheney) He sets policy for this administration and I support the president. She handles herself very well with other people. She either-- comes right out and says stuff, or she turns around and walks away, right? I believe in the sanctity of marriage. I believe that marriage is a-- (woman) You can't judge. You don't know. This person was born this way. You don't know a lot of this stuff that goes on. And I don't know. I think the vice president and his wife love their daughter. I think they love her very much. This is new to me. But no matter what, Lea is my daughter. And she'll always be my daughter. And you can't have anything but respect for the fact that they're willing to talk about the fact that they have a gay daughter. The fact that they embrace her, is a wonderful thing. You've come a long way, momma. (Dick Cheney) Well, Gwen, let me simply thank the senator for the kind words he said about my family and our daughter. I appreciate that very much. (Female reporter) That's it? That's it. (Audrey) This is not the thing that can never get reversed. But if it does get reversed, it will become true somewhere else. It is not about US. It is not about US. In a way it's not about whether your marriage gets revoked. (Woman) That's right. It's a bigger thing. Okay, so maybe your marriage gets revoked. Which it won't. But what if your marriage does get revoked? Right? (Woman) Are you going to go back and you take it? Yes. Are you going to say, "okay?" But it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. Because if your marriage gets revoked, it has happened in history that queer people could get married. And in another 20 years, it will be all over the place. And people will think nothing of it. The way that people could accept this as reality when 20 years ago, nobody was even out of the closet. By endorsing the shameful proposal, president bush will go down in history as the first president to try to write bias back into the constitution. But the reality is-- that we are here for a moment in time that is a foreshadowing. And the foreshadowing is what is life gong to be like for her? What's going to be normal when she's 40? Right? And the reality is that this moment that happened on may 17th, speaks to what it's going to be like when she's 40. And that's what's exciting. It's going to be a different world. And this is the first sign-- that it might be a better world. That it might be a better world. That's what is so exciting. That's what makes-- you know when I was crying that night? That's what makes me cry. It's not that we can get married-- it's that the world is going to change. It's going to change. And maybe it's going to get better. (Man) Matt, we're going to get married. What do you think about that? Good. Yeah? Now the only thing we'd have to do is have Anne sign it. And then, we're officially married. Legally married. But what if she doesn't? Well then we're not married. [Laughing] Why would she not? Well, that's just it. She said she would, so she'll sign the marriage license. What if she breaks her promises? Well then we find someone else. And nothing can stop-- make you unmarried anymore? Right. Nothing? Nothing. But what if somebody ripped it up? You're still married? Yes. The only thing that can undo it is if you get a divorce. Why would you get a divorce? We won't. You don't know that. Huh? You're not a 100 percent-- oh, I'm 100 percent sure. Why would we get a divorce, Matthew? We love each other. You can get mad at each other and you'll be divorced. Yeah, but we'd work it out. It's okay to get mad at each other. I mean like really, really you start hating each other. No, we'd never do that. But it could. Yeah, it could happen. But I don't think it's going to. I know it's not going to. You don't know that. I could never hate daddy. I might be mad at him sometimes, but I could never hate him. (Man) I think I kind of have an idea. And I'm glad poppy's not here, 'cause I get to pick. You and I get to pick. So I'm sorry, you said this was which one? (Woman) That's the golden raspberry. Golden raspberry? Okay. I like that. Take this one. Okay, let's switch. [Violin plays the alphabet song in background] And we'll come over the hill, and down the aisle. Very dramatic. (Woman) And the peeps will come. Well, that will be first. We've got you guys in the center-- center but to one end. Center like back so we don't have our backs to anybody. But it could be like a group, a group, a group, a group. Well why do I have to do that? Because you need a manicure. Let me see your hands. You're getting the big diamond, not me. Tomorrow at 7:15 on Charles street. All of US are getting a manicure? Yes. [Laughing] Yes, you want to come? No, I don't. See, y'all can talk about your manicures and your big fat rings. I don't have my ring. Well you're getting ready for your big fat ring. I know, but I want you to go. So then you should. All right, I'm going to be a little late and I'll pick you up, how's that? I'm not nervous about marrying because I've been with her for 14 years. But it's just like-- I feel like I'm doing a Broadway play or something in front of all these people. But they're all my really good friends and I'm telling myself that. But at the same time, I don't want to faint or fall because it's an outside wedding. (Woman) I thought you might have some good ideas about songs that people should have at their weddings. Annie. Annie? You think? (Girl) That one. (Woman) What would make that a good song for a wedding? Oh, I'll help you. I'll be in it and I'll sing it. You'll sing it if we got married? At our wedding? You would? In front of lots of people? You would? For US? Oh my gosh, that would make me so happy. We can all sing it. We could? Okay, Sarah. Come show poppa. Oh wow. You're beautiful. Are you going to have Rose petals to hand out? Thought you wanted to have the little bouquet. You don't know yet? We'll work that out. You look beautiful. (Poppa) Okay, now do what you're going to do in church. Could I have the rings, please? So then you will-- okay, so what will you do when she says it? Okay, yeah you'd open the box. She'll say, "can I have the rings please?" And you'll take it out for her. And then give it to her. And she'll probably bless it. And then give it to me or daddy. (Woman) Look Mary, our fingers, they're empty. (Mary) Our bare fingers-- our bare fingers. We're going to have another ring to add to my collection. Too many, huh? Oh, I can't believe this is here. What a long fight, huh? I should really wear a belt. It would suck to have my pants fall down in the middle of the ceremony. So, how do I look? Do you want to marry me? (Man) You know by the way-- yeah-- stop. Hold on. Happy anniversary. Oh, happy anniversary. (Man) That's the clerk for the town of wooster. City of wooster. Don't you dare demean US as being a town just because we have trees. What is your personal view on same sex marriages? I think it's a great thing. [Laughing] Especially if people are having a good party afterwards. Finally. Finally, Henry. Now you got it for the record, okay? No, this is a great day. Anytime someone that's in public office can make people happy, and is invited to participate, it's a great thing. I vote yes. 'Cause you-- you bitches know we all would have gotten over there and someone would have said, "where are the rings?" "Where are the rings? Cory, did you bring the ring?" Wait, when am I doing my speech thing? (Al) Here's the order. Oh, I don't want to go first. No, Kayla, you're second to last. Okay. Okay, come stand in the middle. Here, we'll stand right here. And you stand in between US, and you sing for our wedding. We got you something for being in the wedding. So I want you to open it up and you're going to wear it. (Woman) Oh Kayla, it's gorgeous. Oh my god. Absolutely gorgeous. Thank you. You take care of it. It cost a lot of money. I'm going to cry. Don't run your makeup. Tomorrow, tomorrow I love you tomorrow I'm working my way over to my dad. How are you? Very good. Hey. Hey, dad. Congratulations. [Laughing] You're not drunk yet, are you? No, god. I'll fall over. I got your card in the car. Okay. I didn't want to leave it laying around. [Sighs] [Rhythmic applause] Before god, your family, and your friends, I ask you to affirm your willingness to enter this covenant of marriage and to share all the joys and sorrows of this new relationship, whatever the future may hold. Because of you Kayla and I are much better because of knowing you. You have given US faith, you have given US strength, you have given US hope, you have inspired me to follow my dreams, and I really, really, really love you. And I am so happy to be here today in front of all of my friends and family to have them witness our legal marriage which we fought so hard for which many people do not have to. (Reverend) This ring that I give to you this ring that I give to you is a token and pledge is a token and pledge of my constant faith of my constant faith and firm commitment. Our connection is now as complete our connection is now as complete as the perfect circle of this ring. As the perfect circle of this ring. (Reverend) Mary, accept this ring as a symbol of our marriage to one another. Mary, accept this ring as a symbol of our marriage to one another.
