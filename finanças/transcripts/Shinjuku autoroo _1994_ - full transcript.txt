The Closing of the Showa Period: Winter Hiroshima (Showa Period = 1926-1989) Sorry about that. Thank you for your help. You're a good man. Your little sister is lucky. Please call me if you have a pain when you wake up. How's Boss? The nurse injected him with something so he's asleep now. I see... Sis... this is from the syndicate. Don't worry, just take it. All right. Sorry... for having you do a lot for our boss. It's okay. It's woman's work anyway. Please take good care of him. We'll be on the roof. Please call us over if you need any help. I hear a doctor got his ears cut off. You mean the Muraoka group? Those guys are pretty rough. You really think they needed to torture a doctor to find out that Boss is in the hospital? They're just trying to make a point. They're picking on civilians, saying do not meddle with us. If they know what condition he's in, they're sure to attack us for sure. Katsu, I think we should take out Muraoka. Maybe we should make the move. - We'll beat them up. Who'll take over then? As the son, you're definitely out of the picture. Then who? Who else would be willing to go out with guns blazing? I would like to get a big medal. Sorry... I'm not cut out for this... Katsu... Eto... Look after Ayumi for me. Yes, this is criminal investigation department. Mr. Tagami... Who is it? Tagami speaking. It's Yomi. Tomorrow... I'll be taking on Muraoka. I had a feeling that it'll be you. After all, that Saiga group is made up of a bunch of cowards. I'll end the war myself. We'll let you arrest me if I somehow survive this. Wait for me at the public ballpark. Just don't screw it up. Hey, take the guards off Muraoka tomorrow. What for? That's an order. About your bills from bars... Is sending it to Muraoka okay with you? Grandpa... and... Mayu... See? Grandpa's pretty good, eh? Come sit, sit! You see, here... It's a bit heavy though... It went in! - Yes, it did! Katsu... I'm going to take on Muraoka. Eto... Look after Ayumi for me. He's breathing again. Get the MIO blocks ready. Kosui, prepare a life support. He's a veggie... a total vegetable. SHINJUKU OUTLAWS 10 years later Shinjuku, Toyko We're just talking business. Eto... I guess you can't show your face in Hiroshima, not while you're an errand boy for a gang. Well? Mr. Tagami, it's good seeing you. That new law is really getting to us. We're losing young blood left and right. That's not something you can blame on the law or those men. It's your damn company's fault for not even having a grip on your own business. We'll disclose the information on those women tomorrow. Thanks. Mr. Tagami... If you have time to extort our gang members... ...can't you at least arrest those friggin' foreigners instead? What, now that you're a political organization, you can't even pick a fight? Yakuza in the Kanto region have truly fallen far indeed. Miyagi Prison He's alive again! These all happened in the last several months. Not just civilians but Yakuza as well are victims. All have been committed by delinquent Asian and Middle and Near Eastern foreigners. So who's masterminding? The Taiwan Mafia... according to the rumors anyway. What about Okumura's outfit? Think they'll start a war? Dunno. Don't pretend ignorance. Why do you think we keep a detective like you? Because I have some information about exploitation of them, maybe? If I get suspended from my duties, I'll sue for my colleages' exploitation. Don't be stupid. Look, just keep them from starting a fight. I don't care how you do it. You'll need to do it before the public safety unit moves. Got it? Oh, and I just got a report in from Miyagi Prison's warden. They want to speak to you about prisoner Yomi. Katsuichi Yomi! You have a visitor. Katsu... Release on parole has been decided. How's Hiroshima? I'm in control now. We're doing business. I'm the company president. Katsu... Forget about Hiroshima. There's no more gun fighting now. I'll get some money ready for you. I can get it to you at anytime. I guess I was asleep for too long. Can I get a smoke? How's Eto doing? What is it? He took Ayumi and ran off to Tokyo. I hear he started up some business in Shinjuku. Was he socked? We've decided to put some men to go after him. Katsuyoshi... Can you leave Eto to me? We risked our lives together. All right. I'll leave him to you. Just be careful. Katsuyoshi... I don't need the money. Just set up a grave for me if something happens. That'll be enough. You fight with your wife? How pathetic. Detective! I have man. Soon... call, ok? I tell you, ok? Okay, okay. Did you put on perfume? Give good service to your clients. Yomi finally woke up. He might come to kill you. So you're not going to pay your dues? I'm sorry! You better have it ready by 6! Hey... ...why don't you go on a diet? Who is it? If you want a girl, call the number on the leaflet. This isn't a place to play. You've become tough. I... I'm sorry! It's been 10 years. I'm sure a lot of things have changed since then. I don't know much about anything, ...but I still stopped by to see if I can do something. Yes? Oh, Mr. Katayama... Thank you for your care. Huh? Your husband was embezzling. So why don't you just argue and bring me 5 million? He's going to die, you know? You know... ...causing trouble... ...he hasn't changed since childhood. Go hide in your room after I take the car to the front door. Don't let anyone in until I come back. Don't worry. I'll settle things. Mr. Yomi... I'm not sure why you care for Eto... but he's gonna cost you. Where's Eto? He's fine. See? Bro... Long time no see. I'll be taking him back. What? You can't have your way. He pocketed money for the women. He is straight from today. I'll repay the money to you every month... ...with the legal interest. You can take the bitches back. Do you even understand what you're saying? Come on, cut his finger. We can't settle things by talking. Fine, how about a whole arm then? Are you crazy? Oh, so this is the so called "Hiroshima Honor." Fuck that shit. Hand me a blade. Hand me a blade, I said. Blade. You're a Hiroshima Yakuza. Show your pride. Sorry... I don't belong to a gang group. I don't care about yakuza logic. You can say hi to your boss for me. You're going to die, you know that? Eto... Eto, rev up the engine of the car downstairs. Why are you even doing this? Just do it! Hurry! ...they took her! What's the above of the Toryukai group? There's a man... called Okumura of the Aiyuu Federation. Okumura group and Toryukai are in alliance to have full control over Shinjuku. I guess no matter where we run off to, we'll find dirty water behind of the neons. Katsuichi Yomi... ...he's the one who killed the previous head of the Muraoka Group in Hiroshima. He sounds too talented to put away. Even if we try to make him our soldier, it won't be easy. Tread carefully. We have problems of our own. You mean of the Taiwan gangster... Fang? Yes... Fang is on the list of most wanted men that was published by the Taiwan authorities. It seems he entered the country on a fake passport. It "seems"? The international crime division does not get much information. The police is sloppier than you men imagine it to be. They don't even try to capture the criminals that slid in from all over Asia. So in other words they won't do a thing no matter what we do to them. Yomi, I presume? I've heard much about you. I heard that you had a little 'run in' with Katayama. Please, sit. Sure. I'm Asami, of the Toryukai group. ...and this is Mr. Okumura, head of the Aiyuu Federation. You had a mishap as soon as you got out! That's an appearance of high-ranking people just for a mistake made by an underling. I want to make you a deal. A deal? I want you to work for us. I'm not going to become your dog just for a lousy 5 million yen. Yomi... ...you do not have a choice. So is this how the Shinjuku Yakuza works? This has become a good lesson for me. You'll be staying here for a while. Will you also putting someone to watch me? Nope. You and Eto are pretty much free... ...because you can't leave this city that easily. It's like day laborers' hole. We'll provide good nuturition. Why don't you see if you can beat me with just your fists? Fuck using fists. What the hell do you want? Let's talk... come over here. It's not comfortable to you and Ayumi to have your bro come back from the dead, is it? Fuck off! You really want me to leave you like this? If you're investigated, how many years you will be jailed... ...I hope you can see that much. So you buy this crap for 5,000 yen and then sell it for 30,000 yen. You'll make roughly 2.5 million yen. It's a good business, Eto. So, who's supplying you? Yoshizawa. You know him, don't you? He used to be one of Okumura's gang. Yep... that chink, right? Tied with the Taiwan mafia, I bet. Not just the Chinese... they got Koreans and Iranians working for Fang too. He's the one who's really in control around here, not Okumura. You going to tell on me to Okumura? That all depends on you. Mr. Yomi, I was sent by Mr. Okumura. Could you open? Might drop everything. I'm so tired... Mr. Yomi, right? Mr. Okumura sent me to you. This is all room service. So Okumura employs you? No, not employs. He bought me. Thanks for coming. You can go back now. Why? I'll get in trouble. I'll explain it to Okumura. Don't you like me? I can't just leave. You're a weird guy. Don't worry, we'll see each other again. The weather... it'll be sunny tomorrow. What the hell are you talking about? Fortune telling. Whenever I'm in a jam, I call 177 for help. So I'll take your advice for today. You're a funny guy. See you later. Where are we going? The sea. We're going to a fishing port. It's for protection. I doubt we'll use it. A ship will be coming from Taiwan. They are bringing guns. So now we're delivery men? That's pretty weird... What is? I'm not Japanese. I'm from Peru. I'm called Tsujii. I was delivering cocaine... ...on a boat to bring it to Japan. I was wanted for drug trafficking. Mr. Okumura was the one who took me in. Now... I am of no nationality. So once you're dead, that's it. It's not like you are part of the group either. We make a good mercenary team. So why you become a yakuza? Do you need a reason to become a yakuza in this country? Who the fuck are they!? Taiwan Mafia! Shoot! What are you doing!? Shoot! Damn it... You okay? Yoshizawa... An acquaintance of yours? Yoshizawa... used to work for Okumura... The group is breaking up... they're all switching sides to work for this Taiwan mob called Fang. It seems that the members of the Fang showed up the meeting place. I see... How did Yomi do? I heard he killed them all but one. Did you foresee that as well? Asshole! Idiot! I hate you! Damn you! Idiot! Idiot! See! We meet again! What a horrible customer! He wanted me to suck him off in the car! I gave him a nice kick in the balls! You look pretty good now that I see you out like this. I always look this good. Come on, let's get some breakfast. Come on... Breakfast! You're so energetic in the morning. That's because I killed someone. You're a killer? Then you can kill me too. I changed my mind. I'll kill you instead. Why don't you try? You sure? I'm going to do it! Hey. Why'd you call me out here for? There's a guy name Chang who works for the consulate. He'll be making a deal with Yoshizawa for drugs tomorrow afternoon. It'll be just them two, all alone. So what? It has nothing to do with me. I hear Yomi's been doing well for himself. He can actually stand up against Yoshizawa so... Okumura's practically begging him to do work... I guess those 10 years asleep hasn't turn out disadvantageous to him. I bet Ayumi's... Shut up. Take 'em out. Give half to Okumura. Then we'll call off your debt. Why... ...am I in this town? Why am I in this country? Why am I with the yakuza? Don't you want to go back to your country? How can a Christian sell her own body? A lot of my customers are yakuza members. They're all talking about you, Yomi. Are you killing people of the Taiwan mafia? Do you know about Fang? How can I see him? You can't. People contact him through pager and cell phone. Not even his associates know his real name. I see. Let's see your fortune. Don't worry. It'll be sunny tomorrow. Why don't you exercise to strengthen your abdominal muscles and start dieting instead of farting? Someone's here. What do you want me for? I just finished a job. Another killing. I don't know if I'll be coming back if I get arrested this time. I'm not sure if I can protect you guys. What are you worried about? Ayumi and I will manage somehow. If things go bad, I might end up fighting against Okumura. Eto... We can't make it in this town. I'll apologize to Kazuyoshi for you. Why don't you go back to Hiroshima? Ayumi... You said you wanted to open up a shop a long time ago, right? I entrusted Kazuyoshi with some money to build my grave after I die. I've died once already, so building my grave would be of no use. I'll give you the money. Use it with Eto to open up a store. You should've just stayed dead. What did you say? Everything's changed over these past 10 years. No one needs you anymore. Why you...! I'll kick your ass! You're the one who ran! You're the one who embezzled money! You're just not cut out to be a yakuza! But... I still love him. He might've done a lot of stupid things... ...but we managed together these past 10 years. You want me to slice it up? Scram. Stop... He is my guest. Yomi, correct? I am Fang Yuan Shung. There is only one thing I want to know. Are you one of Okumura's dogs? I have no idea what you're talking about. Then let's get more specific. Will you come to kill me? If you're that worried, why not just kill me now? Very well. How much would I have to pay to get you to kill Okumura for me? This place stinks. I think I understand you well now. Even though you died once... ...but I think you're afraid of dying a second time. I will be staying here. Come to me whenever you want. We won't be driving you home. Mr. Tagami? Oh, let me introduce you two, this is... ...Masa, special investigator at the National Police Agency. Pleased to meet you. As you may know, my job is to remove dangerous people that exist within our ranks. I also have a very strong interest in you. Well, I'm sure you're very busy, so let's cut the bull. How much are you getting from Okumura? I know you're selling information to him once or twice each week. And? You also recommended to employ Yomi who was released on parole. So? I am of the belief that Yomi is deeply involved in the shooting incident at the Misaki Fishing Harbor. So how about an answer? Do I have the right to decline? That is acceptable, of course. It's a case of investigation with consent. For now, at least. I'll tell you one thing. Why don't you change your cologne? It's vulgar for you. I'm moving in! Why? Nihao, Mr. Chang... You're late. Are you injured? I have the usual payment. How's the kid? Caught a cold. Here's a tip. You can get the best Roast Pork Ramen in the world for just 20k yen. Thanks. I'll contact you later. It'll be double that amount of drugs. Double... the drugs, the drugs. Yep. Double... double. Bye-bye! Bro! Who the hell are you? Just watching the house. Here, hand this over to Bro. Tell him that it was Eto. Give it to Bro... I hear you've been keeping busy. First Muraoka and now Okumura? You haven't changed much. I didn't become a policeman for the country. It was just to survive. Your situation's pretty much the same, ain't it? It's a plan for chivalry... ...because they're not as straightforward as the Hiroshima Yakuza. Stay a little longer. It's weird... ...why did I think of letting you arrest me? That's because when I decided to out Muraoka, I somehow thought of you. It was for the group. But I didn't have to feel obligated to a detective. Why don't you re-join the army? You can wear a medal of the Okumura group and walk under the neons. How much do you know? Is it Fang? ...or is it... Here, go have some fun with this. What is this? Are you buying me? Just shut up and go. Ayumi, pack your things. What is it? Just do it. What is it this time? Nothing. Hey! Shut up! Going to the hot springs or something? Hey... Mr. Yomi...? Who is it? A guy named Eto stopped by, right? Who are you? I don't know! Where's Yomi? Someone called me and told me to be here. A fuckin' whore. You have nice body. You have money? Damn bitch... Shall I pay you and do to you? Where's the drugs? Using drugs, we can do until we're unable to stand up! I don't know! I don't... know... Where's the drugs? I'm screwed without it! Poor thing... Just look at you. I'll clean you right up. Good girl. Let's finish this. Where are you? Yomi! Sorry about all this. There's not much, but make yourselves at home. I think you'll be safe, but just in case I'll knock 3 times when I come back. Okay? I'll be heading out then. You want anything? Was that guy part of the Taiwan Mafia? Don't think about that right now. I hate them all. They all kill people outside of their own country so easily. The Japanese... Chinese... Koreans... Philipinos. Do you want to leave this town? ...just the two of us. Really? Shall we grab Fang's money and leave this town? I just made a call. It'll be sunny both tonight and tomorrow. This is Fang's work. Their dead bodies were thrown in front of the group's office. I hear he stole Fang's drugs. You can take this. They'll be after you next. I'll ready an executive seat for you... ...if you succeed, that is. Prepare a gun. I want 50 million as the reward. For the drugs and the killing combined. I don't like it... Giving it to a half-zombie. Then will your group deal with it instead? Well... The fool. That Okumura... We're taking them down. Massacre them all. I'll kill Yomi myself. Find them. What did you say? I don't know... We'll just kill them and that's that. Mr. Suji brought that. This too. He said that there's a car downstairs. Will you make me your partner? I'll take out his underlings. Okumura's orders? I repay my debts. Who are you? Japs aren't welcome here. Did you call? It'll be sunny. Go back to your own country. How's it feel? Die... Jap! So you succeeded. We've hit pay dirt... Get my money ready. What's the meaning of this? You mean Fang? Not just him. Yomi took out Okumura too. Tagami, we can put you in restraints you know! What's the meaning of this! The town is cleaner. That is all. Thank goodness! Tomorrow's... - Rain, right? Where's Tagami waiting for us? Since when did you know? Long before I met you. I see... You can kill me if you want. Just like I said before... You'll be able to live a different life once you die. Drive. Yomi! Stop it!
