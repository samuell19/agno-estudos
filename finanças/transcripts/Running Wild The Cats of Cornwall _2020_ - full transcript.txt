So, I started my own organization called Cat Trap, and we believe in the program TNR, trap, neuter, and return.

It’s that now I’m seeing multiple cats that I haven’t seen before and I don’t know how they communicate with each other, how they all end up understanding that that house has two little females that are not fixed and there’s males coming from blocks away to mate with the cats. I mean, all you need is two cats out, right? One male, one female, and off we go again. ♪ And it’s going to be a real issue with neighbors. A real issue. There’s going to be some very unhappy neighbors. I’m afraid for the cats in the summer, like I can’t protect them. ♪ (crow cawing) ♪ Australia is taking drastic measures to control its cat population. Government officials are launching a campaign to kill more than two million cats. Ecologists say feral cats are responsible for the extinctions of more than two dozen native Australian species. What to do with all these stray cats has long been a problem here. Japan has vowed to control the wild cat problem in time for the Olympic Games. (announcer speaking in French) Cats are an invasive species, so bad, they’re killing billions of animals a year. ♪ It’s an instinct in cats when they see something small move along in front of them they just have to go for it. It’s not the cats’ fault at all. ♪ I’m Hannah Lockwood and I research the impact of domestic cats on prey populations. So, this is a cat skull. First, you’ll notice these huge eyes which gives them great depth perception for stalking and pouncing on prey. They also have a separate organ which is located behind the retina, and that bounces light back through the retina and back out. And that’s why you get the eye shine if you ever take a photo of a cat with the flash on. This is a bank vole skull, and it would get it just straight by the neck and eat it pretty much whole and then deliver a killing bite with their sharp teeth. ♪ So that’s the cat skull. (car horn honks) The issue of there being cats in the environment is one of the few, I think, solvable environmental issues that we have. And so it’s going to be up to us, and that includes cat owners, it’s going to include our shelter systems, it’s going to include governments as well. We all generally want the same thing. We want what’s best for cats. We want to reduce the number of cats that are outside, and we want to reduce the impacts that they have on the environment. So, something’s happened here. It looks like the cat p. . oop, yeah, it did. There’s a chipmunk in its mouth. And it’s dropped the chipmunk now. So, there’s a few things we’re hoping to do with this work and maybe there’s guidelines that we can come about from this study that can help cat owners. If they do feel they have to put their cat outside, we can provide some guidelines on what’s best for their cat. -Hey, come on in. -Hello, how are you? Good, come on in. Okay, I’ll show you two videos here. ♪ So, I think he’s just in your yard. Maybe he’s in someone else’s yard. You see his head. He’s doing something, he just caught something. -Oh, oh! -Mouse. No!

Are you proud of yourself? ♪ So, when I talk to cat owners, I try to talk about whether a cat should belong inside or if it should be outside. And certainly, we know that when cats are outside, they get more exercise. But the risk to the cat of being outside, in my opinion, is far greater than those benefits. And what cat owners really care about is their cats and their cats’ wellbeing. ♪ Comin’ out, bud? (whistles) ♪ Well, I think the public well understands that cats sometimes kill other animals. I mean, they’re predators and that’s what they’re designed to do, and cats are not malicious. . or maybe they are in some cases. . but, again, the problem is, there are just so many cats, uh, and they’re so good at what they do, that, uh, literally, millions of birds are being killed every year and they can least afford it. We need to help these populations that are declining because they’re really integral to our forest and grassland ecosystems. A healthy nature. And somebody’s cat might bring back one bird every couple of weeks and they think, "Well, that’s too bad. Bad kitty. " It’s not really a problem until you count up how many cats there are. And with millions of cats in Canada, that adds up. That makes a huge difference. That’s okay. Come on. (mewing) Yes, baby. Hi. Yes. I lost three babies recently.

But cats do impact negatively on our environment. The only humane way to deal with the cat population is through spay and neutering them. Without it, it’s totally uncontrolled. And my feeling was that people expected something to be done about it. So we conducted a survey basically saying, what do you think about it, what a bylaw might look like? ♪ One of the leading questions, of course, was do you think we have a cat overpopulation problem in Cornwall and that something needs to be done about it? Bestow ownership on individuals, require that all cats be kept indoors unless supervised, limit the number of cats in the household to two. Very important, of course, to have community input. ♪ We’ve been affected by it. It’s quite an ongoing issue. It’s getting out of control, that’s for sure. We have to do something about it. ♪ We were simply surprised at the level of response to a cat problem. ♪ This is not my neighbor’s problem, this is not my problem, this is the entire community’s problem and it’s not going to go away. We have to accept that something has to be done about it and there’s probably going to be a cost to that. What I recommended to council is that in the 2020 budget we allocate $40,000 to subsidizing the cost of spay and neutering. That’s a start. ♪ The bylaw that Chris wants to try and get through, "If you feed it, you own it," that is scaring people. I don’t want people to be scared and I don’t want people to say, "Oh Lord, there’s a cat out there, we can’t be responsible for it. " ♪ The fact that somebody has enough charity to give an animal a little better chance to survive means you own them is a strange one, as far as I’m concerned. It goes along with the idea that if you give somebody some money when they’re begging that you own that person. Makes just as much sense. ♪ People like Lynda, she’s going to take care of them, and even if the bylaw passes many people are still going to. They don’t want to see the cats suffer, so I don’t blame them. Simply feeding a cat, absolutely, that’s important. But if that cat is not spayed and neutered, it’s fueling a cat population that we’re trying to get under control. I should just put it down here. (bird chirping) (hum of passing traffic) ♪ The city of Cornwall could become the first municipality in Ontario to require cats to be kept indoors. City staff are proposing a cat bylaw with a number of suggestions: all cats must be spayed and neutered, felines must be kept indoors, and most extreme, anybody who feeds a stray cat legally becomes its owner. But that report came out in May and nothing has happened since. (giggling) You feel sleepy? (kittens mewing) We’ve gone through a whole kitten season and there’s still no money in the budget, so it is frustrating. There’s the purring. Good girl. But hopefully moving forward, there will be more help for kittens like them because I can’t keep up.

And I think Guimauve, his stomach told him where to go and a trap that’s set will have food. ♪ I did some looking around. There’s three neighbors that have traps here. ♪ When I ask them, they won’t answer, so that’s difficult, knowing that somebody probably has done something. ♪ My neighbors were aware what I was doing. ♪ There’s a lot of people that just aren’t on board. It was really tragic. ♪ Spencer spent about three or four days wandering around, crying, looking for Guimauve, they were really close. ♪ They have souls. They can’t think like humans, but they have souls. So you do feel responsible, that it was my duty to keep them safe. But there’s no boundaries for feral cats. ♪ (wind blowing, birds chirping) ♪ It’s pretty worldwide now.

(overlapping chatter) -This is good. -I know, I wanna get a picture. (car horns honking, cheering) Let’s get started. Sorry for the delay. It’s nice to have a full council chamber. The recommendation is that council implement a cat control bylaw vitally supported by funding, in support of a five-year timeline in which all owned cats are to be desexed. Councillor Grant, you’re seconding. Debate. So, Your Worship, I’m not completely convinced we can necessarily implement all these regulations. How do we realistically expect to enforce some of these provisions? I mean, to say, "All cats have to be kept indoors. " Well, if there’s a random cat wandering the neighborhood, how do we know who officially owns that cat? Are we going to give this person a ticket? Through you, Madam Mayor, that’s why it’s vital that cats be licensed. So, hopefully, that cat that is roaming can be linked to its owner by virtue of a tag. Okay, thank you. Councillor Bergeron and then Councillor Grant. Thank you, Madam Mayor. So, when you say cats must be kept inside, as long as they were controlled in their own yard, would you accept that, or. . So, it’s really about ensuring that once a cat is outside that it’s supervised. Yes, yeah. One thing I want to think about is long term and if everybody’s religious in this we won’t have a cat problem because we won’t have any cats. (crowd murmuring) When you think about it, so, I mean. . Through you, Madam Mayor, no bylaw is a hundred percent enforceable. There’s a speed limit out here, in front of this building, it’s 50 kilometers an hour. Uh, I’m sure if I asked everyone in this room if they have exceeded that 50 miles an hour, if they were honest, they’d say yes. Bylaws, they build expectation and certainly, there’s that carrot that says, "Oh, if you don’t live up to that expectation, there could be punitive repercussions. " I live in the West End, and I don’t. . we don’t have a roaming cat problem, that I know. Yes, you do. Yes, you do. Is there an area in town that’s more concentrated and is more concerned where this bylaw would really be effective? This has been going on since, I think I was in council 15 years ago and we were talking about feral cats then. Something has to be done, and we’re going to do it tonight. So I’m going to call the vote. All in favor? (crowd murmuring) Carried. Thank you. (applause, cheering) (chatter) We did it! -We did it. -We did it. -So far. -Yeah. We still have progress to make. We can’t, there’s no way it’s going backwards now. No, there’s just no way. They can’t now. If it’s a five-year plan, that’s still really long. That’s a lot of kittens that could be born in five years. But five years is still better than zero years. Like, at least we’re moving forward. And finally, they’re going to do something about it. A lot of them don’t agree on the "Feed it, you own it" bylaw, which I don’t either, but that’s one of the problems. We’ll figure it out over the years and we’ll iron it out. ♪ The lifespan of cats is much shorter if you have them as outdoor cats, and yet some cat owners still believe, "My cat will be unhappy if it’s indoors, so I’d rather let it outside where it’s dangerous. " ♪ I mean, humans are smart, but at the same time, they’re very simpleminded because it’s an easy fix to encourage people to keep their cats indoors. It’s harder to put the forest back. ♪ Mellissa Alepins and Mary Jane Proulx. Extraordinary people, extraordinarily compassionate, caring, and, you know, not expecting any sort of acknowledgement for it. Just doing it out of sheer compassion and caring. After all, we domesticated these animals, right?

I’ll probably do this forever. I love it, so in that sense, it’s good that there’s no end, but it’s really sad because these are generally orphans that I take, so they don’t have a mom. And it took us, Mellissa and I, to fight this hard. We had to have protests and we had to fight, and I had to run for council. Like run for council, me run for council? Come on. ♪ It pays to fight.
