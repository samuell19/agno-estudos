You know, there's nothing like being liberal with other people's money. Come on! Let's get a-goin'! Get up! By golly, my friend. You and me are going to have lots of fun. I buy for you new blanket... new shoes and a good dinner. Then we go to see my girl. Yes, sir, we are going to have one fine time. I'll send my gal to the city And I send my gal to the town Daisy, Daisy. Give me your answer do. I'm half crazy all for the love of you. It won't be a stylish marriage. We can't afford a carriage. But you'll look sweet upon the seat of a bicycle built for two. It says in here John I. Sullivan is going to quit drinkin'. Did you read that, Henny? I don't believe in them newspaper stories. Probably ain't true anyhow. Look! Here comes that old stagecoach, sure enough. My golly! Hey, those boys are hoofin' up fast. That's for sure. - Whoa! - Hello, there, old boy! - Hello, there. - Hi, Charlie. - Hello, Bill. - Hello. Boys, I was held up down there at the Devil's Pincushion by that Cisco Kid. And I sure would have killed that fella, too... - if my gun hadn't have hung, wouldn't I, Bill? - You sure would have. - Where's the colonel at? - He's inside. Go and see him, Charlie. Say, there's got to be something done here about this Cisco Kid. He held up my stagecoach down here and took my Wells Fargo box. He didn't harm nor rob any of my passengers... but he like to scared all of them to death. Where'd you see him? I met him down here on the desert, what they call the Devil's Pincushion. Oh, orderly. - Yes, sir? - Tell Sergeant Dunn to report to me at once. - Yes, sir. - I'll tell you the facts, what I'd have done. If my gun hadn't have hung on me, I'd, uh, I'd have shot him myself. Yes, I know, Charlie. I know just how you feel about things like that. - Am I faded? - Sure. Come on, sweetheart. One pass for papa. One, that's all. I'll shoot the works. Read 'em and grieve. That's my baby. Rich and ricey, nice and spicy. All right, come on, pay me some of that coin, you guys. Oh, I see where President McKinley... is gonna send a bunch of you boys down to Cuba. Yeah, so I understand. Come on, sweetheart. My Brooklyn baby needs new shoes. Dynamite. Another natural for Big Casino. Hey, what's the idea? Did you walk through a pasture or somethin'? Come on, long-haired Liz. - That's the one... - Sergeant! Oh, get out of my life, hard luck. Come on. Ada from Decatur crossed the equator. It's a four. Hey, listen, bad news, if I never see you again, it'll be soon enough for me. - But the colonel wants you. - Well, why didn't you say so? That's different. Come to papa, sweet mazuma Come to papa, come to papa... Hey, what's the... Hey! So long, boys. I hear my master's voice. Yeah, but your point is four. Well, what do you want me to do, cry? Geez. Hey, can you imagine? Just because he's got stripes, he thinks he's a zebra. I never saw a guy like that... Sarge. - Sarge? - What? I've got a great idea. You do the playing, I'll do the interrupting and we'll split. Are you trying to make a dishonest soldier out of me? Dishonest? Well, holy... Sergeant Dunn reporting for duty, sir. Sergeant, the Cisco Kid is back in our territory. He just held up the stage coming in from the south. And it's up to our outfit to get him. I want you to take a squad of men and go into wolf country. Camp at the Frio and work west. Yes, sir. And don't get the idea this is any picnic. This is not the usual type of cattle rustler. He's smart and he's brave and he's a killer. And you don't need to worry about any court-martial... if you shoot first and argue afterwards. Do you understand? - Yes, sir. - Then get going. Yes, sir. Charlie, thanks very much for the information. He'll bring him back dead or alive. Well, I'm darn glad of that. And I'll bring over a pistol the next time I come too. - Hello, Edward! - Howdy! - Morning, Mrs. Doolittle. How's Henry? - Fine, thanks. That's good. Well, good morning. Well, boys, he's done it again. This time it was the stagecoach. - Who did what? - It's your lone bandit. Why, he come tearin' down the gulch and held up the stage all by himself. What'd he get away with this time? He took the Wells Fargo box and all the gold that was in it. What? I just a-send my wife $87 to Sicily by the Wells Fargo. Well, you can kiss that good-bye. When this here Cisco Kid does a job, he does it right. I wish I had my hands on him. I do good job-a myself. We've got to form a vigilante committee and hang him to the highest tree... and I'm going to start it. They say he'll shoot you quick as he'll look at you. But if I ever meet him face-to-face, I'll kill him like I would a dog. What? You would kill somebody? - You heard me. - I kill him too. First I try to get my $87 back. You lose $87, my friend? Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk. That is too bad. I hate to see working man lose so much money. This Cisco Kid, he's very bad egg, I guess? - He's bad, all right. - And plenty dangerous too. They say the gals are all crazy about him. Ha! That's funny. Funny? I don't know. He may be very handsome. Probably just a dirty greaser. Oh. You have never seen him, no? No, but we're going to. Come on, Joe. Let's get this vigilante committee started. We'll make this town safe anyway. Yes. We'll get Cameron, Randolph and Turner and the rest of the gang. We'll round him up before the night is over. It took me six a-months to save that $87... and now it's all gone. My friend, up in the hills, I have find much gold. Ha! I tell you what I do. You fix for me a nice bath... with nice, sweet soap... nice, new towel... and then when I go away, I make up to you all the money you lose. Grazie, Signore. You are very kind. Uh, thank you. That's enough. No more customers today. Only you. Now I fix a fine-a tub. That's right, my friend. I'll send my girl to the city And I send my girl to the town And my gal still young and...

There is... a very beautiful girl... coming into your life. Beautiful face. The most beautiful eyes. Hair and teeth. She is a dream. And what a figura. - Figura? - Yeah! He got a shape just like "Venice." Venice? That's in Italy, ain't it? You are going to fall madly in love with her. "Going to"? Come here. Tell me. Do you make much money? Enough for two, and maybe three? You like to look ahead, don't you? You are very... romantic? Yeah? Well, you ain't doin' so bad yourself. Listen, baby. I'm gonna be transferred next month to Governor's Island. Yeah? Where is that? Back to civilization. New York, right at your front door. Oh, I'd like to see it. You take me there? Sister, that's the idea that's been gallivanting through my mind this very minute. Aw, you and me in New York together. Say, you'll love it. New York! Why in New York, you can get a glass of beer that high for a nickel. On ice, too. And the Bowery! Baby, you ain't seen nothin' till you see the Bowery. Finest street in the world. Saloons and dance halls everywhere. Free lunch. All you can eat for nothin'. And the finest whiskey? Ten cents a throw. You can pour it yourself. They got pretty clothes for girls there? Clothes? Baby, you can get the swellest pair of shoes in the world there... for two dollars. And hats? Well, you can get a hat for a dollar and a quarter with a feather that long. And petticoats? Oh, baby. Wait'll you see the petticoats. Every color under the sun. Girls show 'em on rainy days. Oh, rainy days! That's when you see the sights. Hot tomato. - Oh, I would love to see it. - Yeah? You and me together. Is it a go? Yes. It is a go! Let's seal it with a kiss. One for Big Casino. You mind your own business. You get out. Get out, quick! - She-devil! - Get out, you... I hate that old woman. She's always so nosy. She's always spying on me. - Yes? - Where's your camp? - Far from here? - No, not very far. I would love to see it. - You take me there? - Sure. - You got a horse? - No. - But I ride with you? - Aw, that suits me, baby. Please. I get my shawl? All right. I be with you in just a minute. - I am ready. - Yes. Don't you want to leave a note for, uh, somebody? Why do you say this? Well, I thought the old woman might worry. Oh, let her worry. I hope she worries the rest of her life. The old cat. Come on, baby. Are there nice soldiers in the camp? Yeah. Perfectly nice. There'll be a hot time in the old town... That's the Cisco Kid, all right. What do you reckon... he's gonna get for them steers? About 4,000. Ol?! 5,000 on his head and 4,000 in his pocket. That's 9,000 for us. Say, all we gotta do is to trail him in the hills... and give him both barrels in the back. Why, it's the easiest money we ever got. Now, he's heading through to Coyote Wells. Now, come on. Let's take to the pass. Ol?, camino! Andele, andele! Whoa. Well, this is the place. Now, let's wait for him up on the bluff. Come on. Thank you for the money, my friend. Good-bye. Good luck. Ben, have you ever seen that fellow before? No, I don't believe that I ever have. Well, take a good look at him, because you'll never see him again. Those three cattle rustlers have been waiting for him. Two-to-one, they'll get him. Beat him to it. Bring him down the first chance you've got. There he is! Give it to him, Art. Hey! You coyote, you! Tell him you meet the Cisco Kid. These other two fellows don't talk no more. The Bowery. They say such things and they do such things on the Bowery. The Bowery. I'll never go there anymore. Go on, sister. Try it. You got a swell voice. - I should sing it? - Sure, go ahead. Gurgle it. Give her a chord, Joe. Now. The Bowery. - The brewery. - No, no. Not the brewery. The Bowery! Go on, baby. Now. The Bowery, the Bowery. They say such things And they do such things... On the "bawry", the "bawry". I don't think. I go there some more. That's fine, baby. Swell. Sweetheart, you got a voice like a Brooklyn sparrow. I don't understand it. You tell me what a nice place this Bowery is... and that you're gonna take me there to show it to me. Then, in the songs, you say: "You don't think you go there some more." How you make that out? - Say, I never thought of that. - Hey! Hey, wait a minute. Where ya goin'? - I go fix your place? - Yeah? - I come right back. - All right, baby. Don't be long, baby. - Sweet as a peach. - I guess. Some worker. I gotta give you credit, Sarge. You sure can pick 'em. Ha, ha. Love and duty. For once, they go together. How do you mean, "together"? - You fellas know why we come up here. - Why, sure. Hey. Listen. Now, this gal used to belong to the Cisco Kid, see? But when I came into her life, things changed. Cut that out. - Mickey. Mickey! - Yeah? - What do you want, sweetheart? - Come here. Oh, I'm practically there. - What's on your mind, sister? - Now I know why you come to my house. You come there looking for someone. That's right, baby. I was lookin' for you. Not the first time. The first time, you come looking for a man. A bandit! - How do you know? - I am not blind. - Here is a paper, offering... - Wha... reward for him. A big reward. Is that the reason you make love to me? To get the man and the money? - No, no, no, no. N... - That is a lie. You are a cheat. I hope he kills you. - Hey, baby... - No me toques. No me quieres. - No me quieres. - Hey, wait a minute, sister. Gee! Doesn't come to the level with this gal. Oh, he ain't. He plays them all. He's serious this time. This morning he asked me if I knew anything about... buying furniture on the installment plan. - No! - Wanted to know how much it would cost... to furnish a flat in Flatbush. Say, don't let that fool ya. Six weeks lets him out with any gal. Say, listen. He buys weddin' rings like you and me buy bananas. That is, if we bought bananas. How much is this reward? $5,000. Say, you didn't think I was figurin' on any part of that, did ya? What do you mean? Why, I was gonna turn the whole amount over to you. I did not know this. - Yeah? - $5,000, all for me? Why, certainly. I'll get a promotion out of this. And a gal? That's enough for me, baby. You get the money, all of it. $5,000! Oh, the things I could buy with this. - Dios! - Yeah? Hey. The sarge is framin' a nice surprise on this bandit. Only gonna take his life and his gal. That's all. He ain't out of it yet. Don't worry. Don't worry. - He's the best shot in the army. - Well, he'll have to be. If what I hear of this Cisco Kid is true. Yeah? When do you expect the Cisco Kid to come back? Soon. Guadalupe is not very far. Yes. He will be back soon. Maybe you better take me home? I tell you this. You will never capture him alive. Yeah? Well, I ain't figurin' on capturin' him alive. $5,000! - I'll be rich. Rich! Come on. We go now? - All right, baby. Maybe you got better mantilla than this? This is the best one I got. It is very rare. It come from Seville. Yeah? How much you take for him? One hundred dollar in gold. That is fine. I buy him. By gollies, you know I ride many miles just to find you. Yeah. I say to myself... I cannot go home unless I bring something nice for mi enamorada. - Thank you. - Yeah, I can see her in this now. Beautiful like angel. - Adi?s. - Adi?s. - Adi?s. - Adi?s, amigo. - Adi?s! - Adi?s. Soldier... in the house. Adios! Well, baby, that's what I call a perfect evening. Pardon me. I love no one but you. My soldier. And the Cisco Kid... I never, never loved him. I swear to you. Mickey, my love, he will come back soon. He will kill you on sight. You must not let him find you here. He is a beast. I wish he were dead. You must kill him. He tell me he would never be captured alive. He is desperate. Oh, I wish he were dead. Will I get this reward money soon? Sure you will. Just as soon as they identify him. I will send you a note by the old woman. When he returns. Maybe-Maybe tonight. About 10:00. My lover! So long, my muchacha. 10:00. Yaqui, my friend. You remember I told you... I was great lady's man. That does not go now. I am not as good as I think I am. And maybe I never was. Coney Island! Brooklyn! - The Bowery! $5,000! - I send my girl to the city - And I send my girl to the town - Dios mio! And my girl, she's young And she's pretty And she's ready to settle down - Well, mi vida. - My lover! I was afraid something might have happened to you. I was afraid you might not come back. I would not disappoint you. I know how anxious you have been for me to come back. Tonia. Tell me. Have there been anybody here looking for me... today? Why, no, no. - No? - No! Tonia Maria, this law is closing in around me. Tonight, I am sure that this-this life I live-it does not pay, but- but like the man who is caught in the-in the whirl- whirlpool, I cannot get out. That is what a thief comes to know. He cannot rub out his past. Ah, he may be able to get away from these people... who hunt for him... but he can never get away from himself. I go on, Tonia, till the chapter here is finished, but... I know in the end I will pay. Tonia... we will go far away tonight together? To Portugal! Ah, Tonia, I try. I try to start all over again, just for you. Ah, that will be grand! But... I cannot get ready tonight. Tomorrow. - Tomorrow? - Yes, ma?ana. Well, you get ready for long, long journey. Get me wine. Get me vino. - I get you wine and fruit? - Yes. I put my horse in corral. Elenita? Elenita! - Where you been? - At the market. - In the wagon? - Sure, in the wagon. Listen. Take this note to soldier. Ride in the wagon to his camp. Do you know where it is? Hurry, quickly. It's very important. Don't make talk. I explain to you when you get back. Here. Quick. Hurry! Hurry! The old cat. Say, listen. Why don't you fellas change the bill of fare once in a while? Beans, beans, beans. Geez. General Grant said, "Let us have peas." What a memory that boy has got. Eggs! Why don't you get some eggs? Say, do you know that eggs cost 15 cents a dozen? - Do you have to buy 'em? - Well, what do you want me to do? Lay 'em? You can't do that. For soldier. Si, Conejito. Men all love Tonia Maria. You can get any man you want. I did not tell you, I was to Yuma. You got something for me? The surprise of your life. Look. A mantilla! - From Seville. - Oh, it is lovely. It is you who... are lovely. To you, my faithful... loyal, constant sweetheart. To your eyes, with their warm devotion. And to your lips, with their warm kisses. And to the heart of you and all the other girls in the world who... who are true... I drink. To you, my brave caballero. The bravest of the brave. My lover. I'm sorry, Tonia. The wine was so strong, it-it make me cough. It don't make me cough. Andele, andele! - The old woman. - Listen, you better be careful, Sarge. - You know, you're liable to get in some trouble. - Listen, you fellas, keep quiet. No funny business, now. You understand? I didn't say anything. What's the matter with the guy? - Who is the old woman? - Aw, she lives with the gal. Well, he better look out for them foreigners. They do things different. Se?or. Gracias, se?ora. I guess I know who it's from. Anda, caballo. "He is here, but he is going away tonight. He is frightened. He thinks the posse knows his hiding place. When he goes, he will be disguised as a girl. He will wear my clothes, and on his head... a large, white mantilla. I will wear his clothes, and ride away." "Come at 10:00 tonight. "Do not fail. Shoot quick and straight. A hundred kisses, Tonia Maria." Hey, here's something else. "Remember, he will wear a large, white mantilla. You will be able to see it from a distance." You get the idea, boys? The bandit's gonna try to escape tonight in a girl's clothes. Well, this is empty. - You have more? - No, no. No. I have had... enough. The job's finished, boys. I get my man tonight. Get him alone. You better let us go with ya, Sarge. No, sir. I've got a particular reason for wanting to turn this trick all by myself. So long, boys. The old sarge has got a new gal... and she's a pippin. Hey, we ought to go along with him anyway. Nah, nah. Didn't I tell ya he was the best shot in the army? Oh, well... I think it is getting dangerous for me to stay here. - I better go. I send for you. Adi?s. - No, no! You must not go. You must not. I will not let you. I will not let you. You must stay here tonight. I am afraid to be here alone. Tomorrow, you can go. But I will not let you go tonight. Such anxiety is touching. You are so beautiful... I could not refuse you... anything. We should have gone... to Portugal tonight. I better look around outside to make sure there is no danger. I... Somebody is out there. Adi?s, my beautiful angel. That is what you are. And what you will be... an angel. When I ride away... you stand outside where I can see you... and wave good-bye to me. Then I know you love me. If it is to be the end, I want to know that... you are thinking only of me. My beautiful angel. Adi?s. - Adi?s. - Don't forget... to wave to me when I ride away. Adi... Her flirtin' days are over. And she's ready to settle down. My Tonia with her dark eyes dancing my Tonia with her smile entrancing though your kisses are divine still I wonder if you're mine oh, sometimes I adore you madly and sometimes I could leave you gladly you were love undying still my heart is crying Tonia are you truly mine?
