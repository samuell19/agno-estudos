(chickens balking) (metal clanking) (heavy breathing) (rooster crowing) (suspenseful music) (singing) - Come far? - Chicago. - That's a hell of a long way. How long it take you? - How long you figure it took? - Hitchin? Well I'd say, three, four days at least. - That's right. - What do you mean? - Took three or four days. I lost count. All seems kind of mixed up now since they died. - Who died? - Ma and Pa. What's this? - Never seen one of those before? Here. (upbeat music) Okay? - Can I do it? - Help yourself. - How do you get it out? - Here you go. (soft music) - [Woman] You married? - [Man] Uh uh. What are you doing all the way out here? - [Woman] All the way out where? - [Man] Here, in New Mexico? - Oh, I'm visiting my granddaddy. He's at this ranch. That's pretty. That. - Oh. - It's a nice car. Hey, why you slowing down? - Cigarettes. (talking and laughing) (upbeat music) (kissing noise) Hey, don't do that. Hey, hey, cut that out. What the hell he do that for? - Hope he didn't hurt your car. - I didn't say a word to him. - Wanna stop? I could get out, take a look. - Nah, forget it. The company'll take care of it. - [Woman] Don't go too fast now, we're almost there. - I don't see any crossroad. - It's just the other side of that big sign. - You sure this is the place? - Uh huh. - How can you tell? - They told me to look for a big picture of a space man. - Well, nice meeting you. Hope everything turns out okay. - Sure is getting awful dark. - Okay. How far is it up that road? - They said about six miles. - Alright, I guess I can spare another half hour. - Granddaddy sure will thank you. - [Man] How long's it been since you saw him last? - [Woman] Who? - [Man] Your Grandpa. - [Woman] Oh I ain't never seen him. (soft music) - Well you let him know you were coming, didn't you? Didn't you? This is a long six miles. Sure we're on the right track? - Uh huh. - You know, there are a lot of those space man billboards up on along the road. - I know it's right. I dream of this place all the time. I do. It's over there. See that cabin? - I thought you said it was a ranch. - Well it's kind of a ranch. - What does he raise here? - Corn, peppers, tomatoes. Keeps chickens. Granddaddy, granddaddy, I'm here. - Doesn't look like anybody's home. - Well maybe he's feeding the stock. I'll go see. You check the cabin. - Hey I'm... (crickets chirping) (suspenseful music) (knocking) Hello? (knocking) Anybody there? (knocking) Anybody home? Hey, where are you? Hey? Nobody here. - I can't find 'em neither. I don't know where he coulda gone. - Well, that's what you get for not letting 'em know you were coming. - Well let's go inside and wait. - You can't, damn door's locked. Wait a minute, how'd you know that? - I told you, I've been here in my dreams. I know the place all over. Bring your lighter over here. I found a lamp. Well, just needs cleaning up a little bit. - What a god awful stink. - Hey you, hey. Hey, why you so aggravated? - I'm tired. Can't keep my eyes open and I'm gonna have to drive all night if I'm gonna get to LA in time to catch my plane. - Well what about me? - Your grandpa will be back soon. - Stay with me. - Haven't I done enough bringing you out here. I can't stay. It's my first vacation in three years. I'm going to Honolulu. - Please, stay with me. I'm scared to stay by myself. - Listen, just go on inside and try to get some sleep. Your grandpa'll be along soon, you'll see. - Guess you're right. Thanks for the ride. (laughing) (suspenseful music) - Open the door god damn it. - [Woman] No, I'm not letting you in, you'll hit me. - You're damn right I will. What's your name, kid? - [Woman] Rosalie. - That's a nice name. I'm Virgil Young. - [Rosalie] Hi. - Hi yourself. Get off. You damn near cut my hand off. - [Rosalie] Wish I had. - Why you so mad at me? Huh? All I've done is try to help you. - [Rosalie] I ain't mad, you're the one who's mad. - But I'm gonna miss my plane. - [Rosalie] If you wanna leave so bad, you better start walking. I reckon it's only about 30 miles back to that cafe, if you can find a highway. Goodnight, Mr. Young. (fly buzzing) (horn honking) - Come here you little. (knocking) - Coffee, I made you some coffee. Don't you try nothing funny. - Oh come on. Put that stupid thing away. I'm too tired to play games with you this morning. Where's grandpa? Huh? Hey. Alright, where's a nearby telephone? Look, there must be a house nearby with a telephone. You know, you're really incredible. - You think I would make a good wife? (laughs) What's so funny? - Well you're a little young for marriage, aren't you? - What's being young got to do with it? - I go out of my way to help you and you wreck my car, you're an ungrateful brat. You oughta be spanked. And what about the telephone? You know, I gotta call my office. - I really need some money and I need some food. - Sure, just go across the road to the local supermarket. - No, if I take the mule, I can get to Los Alamos and back in two or three hours. At least that's what I do in my dreams. - No, it won't work this time honey. You know this place too well, you've been here before, haven't you? - I live here. - Okay Rosalie, let's have the whole story. Where's your grandpa? - You're standing on him. He died day before yesterday, I buried him there. - This water come from that well? - [Rosalie] Sure. - Then all that stuff about Chicago was just another story? - Well I didn't wanna stay here alone. But when I ran away, I got scared. I wanted to come back, I had to tell you something. - [Virgil] Well, you must have some folks somewhere. - No. Never had a daddy. And when I was little, my mamma ran off with some man. And left me here with granddaddy. Never did know where she went. - Well one things certain, you can't stay here all alone. - Well I was hoping you'd stay here with me. - When I get to town, I'll see the police. They'll send somebody out to take care of you. - It ain't so bad here. You and me could have fun together. - You don't understand, you're a minor. There are welfare organizations that take care of things like this. - Please don't go. - I have to. - Alright. Alright. If you think it's best to send those people out here, go ahead. - Alright. Alright, now you're being sensible. - I got some water heating if you wanna wash up before you go. - Thanks. - And I'll show you a shortcut to town. There's a trail up on the side, it's on the side of that ridge. (soft music) Just something to dry off with. - You know, Rosalie, my company contributes to various welfare organizations. - [Rosalie] That so? - Yeah. I got to know a couple of the supervisors. They're nice guys, you'd like 'em. Where's the towel? (groans) (groaning) You broke my leg. - Come on, let's get you to the bed. - You, you. - Come on. Come on. - Hold on, I can't. Hold on. - There, you'll get better now. - It hurts. It hurts. - I had to do it. I lost you. - You're crazy. Get me a doctor. Come on, go into town and get me a doctor, quick. - It ain't too bad, I didn't hit you real hard. (groaning) - Get me a cigarette. You're crazy. You're really nuts, you need a doctor worse than me. - Is it alright if I take some money? We ain't got nothing to eat here. While I'm in town, I'll get us some food. - You listen to me, I don't care what you do, you just get me a doctor. - Alright, you rest real easy now. I'll be back in a little bit. (soft music) - Hey. Hey where's the doctor? Hey did you hear what I said? Where's the doctor? When's he coming? - Ain't you glad to see me? - When's the doctor coming? - Did you miss me? - Yeah, I missed you. What about the doctor? - Well, I went to his house but just as I got there, he was leaving in his truck. - His truck? That couldn't have been a doctor. - Had his little hat on with the badge. - Oh for Christ's sake, it was probably the milk man. You leave a message for him for the doctor to come out here. - No, I reckon your first day I should get back and look after you. - You, what the hell do you know about broken legs? What's gonna happen to me if it doesn't mend right? - You'll be alright. I fixed a chicken leg once, same way I fixed yours. It was cute. Walked just like a duck. Think of that, a chicken walking like a duck. - What are you trying to do? Keep me in this lousy, stinking dump? There's filth all over the place, there's chickens everywhere. Want me to get sick? Want me to die? - Scat, scat. Scat you vermin. He don't want you in here. - Yeah and you're just as bad, look at yourself. You're filthy. Don't you ever wash? - Course I wash. Hands, face and feet every morning, all over in every week. My mamma taught me that. Only trouble is, I never seem to know when one week ends and another one starts. Granddaddy didn't wash mornings. Why you so mean to me? The chores get me dirtied up. - Well I'm sorry Rosalie. I know you think you know how to fix a broken leg, okay? But we don't know how bad it is. It'll have to be x-rayed, there could be complications. I could get gangrene, then how'd you feel? - I'd feel real bad. - I know you would. Now all you have to do is bring a doctor out here. I promise, I won't blame you. I'll tell him that I-- - What's gangrene? - Your damn leg turns green and falls off. - Looks okay to me. - You can't keep me here like this. - I'm not keeping you. You're free to leave whenever you want to. Go on, leave. - I can't walk. - Then you'll have to wait till you can. - Is it money you want? I'll give you money. - You already gave me money. - You'll go to jail for this. Somebody's gonna come out here and find me. The mailman. They'll miss you at school. - I don't go to school. - Ha, the truant officer. He'll be out here after you. - Nobody knows about this place, except for Fry. - Who's Fry? - He used to come pestering granddaddy about his gold. - Well he'll be out here for sure. What gold? - Don't worry. He only shows up when he needs a place to sleep. He sure don't like it here. Gotta go take care of the stock. (soft music) You wanna wash up before supper? You know, I've been thinking. If we sell your car, we could fix the place up real good. I'd like to clear a patch of ground for potatoes. You know how much green potatoes cost? A dollar a bushel. Know how I know? I went right in the store and asked 'em, that's how. Here, I've got some nice peaches for you. You're so sick, you sure should keep your strength up. - Now, you get me a doctor or I'm gonna choke the life out of you, I swear it. - How'd you like me to break your arm too? You shouldn't always try to be so smart, Mr. Young. Now eat your supper. Ain't bad, these peaches sure are tasty. It would be nice if we got a cow. Maybe a couple hogs too. For the winter for meat. What do you think about that? You don't have to be so muley. I didn't have to let you have the bed, you know. When granddaddy was alive, I always had to sleep on the floor. Except in winter when he couldn't get warm and he made me get in with him. See how nice I am to you? - What about the gold, Rosalie? Rosalie? Did you hear what I said? - Thought you wasn't talking to me. - There's no sense in us both being childish. - It's kinda funny, you asking about the gold. Makes you like Fry. You're like him. - Well if you got all this gold, what the hell do you need me for? - I ain't got it. It's with granddaddy. Like his gun and his knife. - Buried with him? - Sure. You gotta a person's things with 'em, everybody knows that. - Rosalie, do you know what gold is? - Gold. - It's money. - Dollars is money. - Gold is better than dollars, it's hundreds of dollars and it's not gonna do your grandpa any good now. - Know something, Virgil? You smell a heck a lot better than granddaddy. Come on, come on. Come on. - Hey, where you taking me? - You'll see, just lie still. (groaning) - Go easy. - What, granddaddy used to love this when he was ill. - Yeah, well, he didn't have a broken leg. - Come on, girl. Come on. - Slow down, not so fast. (soft music) Help, help! Help! (laughing) The pain is killing me and you stand there grinning like some kind of a half-wit. Why don't you poke my eyes out or how bout yanking out my teeth and making a necklace. That's what you Squaws do with your victims, isn't it? That's what you are. You're a ignorant little half-breed Indian Squaw. My god, all that crap about being lonely and needing help. You trap the first guy who comes along, you smash his leg with an axe, to hell with his job, to hell with all the people out there worried sick about him. They oughta put you in a zoo. That's right, a zoo. They oughta put you in a cage and charge admission. - I know I did wrong breaking your leg. I just always dreamed of having someone of my own. - Cover yourself for Christ sake, you don't walk around without any clothes on. Now look, I'll make you a deal. If I can show you that this whole idea of yours is just a childish, silly, stupid dream, will you get me a doctor? - What do you mean? - Can't you understand plain english? If I can prove to you that you don't really want me to stay here with you, will you get me a god damn doctor? - You can't. - I can and I will. Is it a deal? Alright. Well at least we're getting somewhere. You remember yesterday, you told me, if I let you sell my car, you'd have enough money to stock this place for the winter? Alright, go ahead and sell it. - That's all I gotta do? Is sell your car, then you'll stay? - That's right. And I don't think you're gonna do it. - Gotta bring a salesman here. - That's right. - Well I ain't gonna do it. I ain't bringing anybody out here so you can holler for help. - I knew you were gonna say that. I knew it. Now a minute ago when we were shouting, could anyone have heard us back at the cabin? - Too far away. - Well stupid, why don't you leave me right here where I am. Come on, Rosalie, you couldn't have a fairer deal than that. - You'll stay right here? - No, I'm gonna hail the first taxi that passes by. Look, either you sell the car or you get me a doctor, like you agreed. - Alright, alright. You don't have to holler. I wonder how long it's gonna take me but I'll get back here as quick as I can. - Wait, wait a minute, now what are you doing? - I gotta get to the highway so I can hitch a ride into town. - Boy, you really are hopeless. - Now what I do wrong? - What are you gonna leave the mule on the side of the road for a couple of hours when anybody can come along and steal it? How are you gonna get me back to the cabin? You just don't bother to think, do you? - Sure do figure things out, Virgil. It's great when you get somewhere for me. It's only when you get smart against me, I get so mad. - Rosalie. I'm sorry I was a little harsh on you just now. While you're in town, why don't you get yourself a brand new dress. - You buying me a dress, that makes me a woman. - Sure. Hurry back now. (sheep baaing) Come here, easy, easy. Here we go, here mule. That a boy. Ya, ya. - Virgil. You try to do anything like that again, I'll kill you. (soft music) (yells) - Ain't you got anything in this dump but peaches? - Who asked you to make yourself at home, Fry? - I got worried about you. Didn't say nothing to me so I thought maybe you was in trouble. Girl like you, gotta be careful. And you know just what I need. - I didn't say nothing to you cause I don't you, that's why. - You was getting around a lot better last time I seen you. You shouldn't mess with kids. - I haven't touched her. - See that? Mess with her, she gets around me. Yeah. Ask Bear. - Bear's dead. Died three days ago. (laughs) - Jesus. Sure sorry to hear about that, Rosalie. Lucky thing I come along, Bear always said when he died, he wanted me to look after you. - I sure as hell don't need you to look after me, Fry. - Hell you don't. Bear's counting on me to see you don't give his gold away to the first guy that comes along. - I don't want any gold. I don't want any gold, all I want's a doctor. You get me a doctor, you're rid of me. - Why don't you get him a doctor? - I'll be glad to pay you for your trouble. - 22 bucks. That bike of mine uses a lot of gas, buddy. - Alright, I'll write you a check. How much do you want? 100 dollars alright? - Uh huh, yeah. Why don't you make it 150? - 150, alright. Look, you can cash it anywhere. Just show 'em your drivers license. - You're making me mad, Fry. - Sit down. - You get out of here and leave us alone. - You gotta sign this, don't you? - Tell them it's serious. Tell them to bring an ambulance. Fry, come on. What are you waiting for? - I can't just leave, Bear wouldn't want that. Not until he knew his gold was in safe hands. - I don't know where it is. - Now listen, honey. You just tell me where the gold is and I'll see you're taken care of real good. Bear'd want that. - What are you deaf or somethin'? I told you, I don't know where it is. He had me get it from him a couple of weeks ago. I don't know where he put it. - Okay. Alright. Eenie, meanie, minie, moe. (banging) You know where it is people, you don't need trouble. (coughing) Where's the god damn-- - She doesn't know where it is. How many times she have to tell you, you stupid ape? - I sure hope that leg of yours is knitting real good. (groaning) - Leave him alone Fry. It's down the well. Behind a loose brick. - That a girl. You stay here. You and your boyfriend try to split, I'll skin ya. By god boy, you better believe it. - You go out there and pretend like you wanna see how he's getting along and then cut the rope. - I ain't gonna do nothing like that. Fry ain't never done nothing to us. I wish you meant it when you said I could have that dress. If you did mean it, then I could go to town as soon as he gets outta here. - I wish to Christ you hadn't buried that gun. - I was thinking of a blue one. Maybe yellow'd suit me better though. - He isn't gonna budge from this place till he gets what he wants. - What do you think? Yellow or blue? - Yellow or blue what? - The dress. You told me I could have it. - Yes, for Christ's sake, what do I care what color it is? - That makes me yours. - [Virgil] Did you really bite his finger off? - Yeah. Well, see, he started tickling me, all over. Drove me crazy. Had to do something. He made me pay for it. - I wish I could move. I wish I could get around. - Ain't down there, is it? Huh? - Hell Fry, if it was around here, I woulda seen it by now. - Maybe you didn't look hard enough. (mumbling) (yelling) - Take it, here. - [Fry] Huh? - Here, in my car, a black case in the trunk. Well go on. - You got yourself a real winner, honey. - It's the first time you ain't been smart. Now he's really gonna be mad. - Well I'm mad. Yeah, the way he was all over you. - Really? - Yeah, really. He hurt you? - Means you really care about me. We gonna get married? - Will you keep your mind on Fry? Now look, when comes back, don't do anything to stop him from leaving. - What's in that case anyway? - Don't ask him to wash or clean up or have a little supper with us or anything. - What the hell's those? - What the hell they look like? Old man traded in his gold for 'em. - How come he didn't tell me? - Sure are dumb, Fry. Granddaddy knew you didn't hang around here just to be friendly. - I seen that bag of nuggets around here a couple of weeks ago. - Well I told you, granddaddy had me get the gold from the well. And he went away for a couple of days and when he came back, he had that case with him. - Yeah? Well then how come the case is in his car? - Safety. Soon as my leg was fixed, we were gonna go into town and sell it. - And then you just dump her and have yourself a real good time. Well, sure is a good thing I came along. And don't think I ain't gonna share with you, baby. This is my half right here. (laughs) And that's yours, over there. - Get to the highway and hitch a ride, you gotta get to town as fast as you can before that idiot gets back here. - I'm real mad at you, Virgil. - You're mad at me? Now what? - Them nice things, you gave 'em to Fry and you give me one. - Rosalie, my company sells the best line of costume jewelry in the business. I'd let you have all of it if I'd known you wanted 'em. Don't you understand, they're worthless? They're fake. - Fake huh? Like that car you wanted me to sell. - But I saved your gold, now will you get going? - I don't trust you like I trust Fry. - Rosalie, you're being stupid again. First store he tries to sell that stuff, he's gonna know I tricked him. He'll come running back here, mad as hell. He's gonna kill us, both of us. - At least I know what Fry'll do before he does it. You say one thing when you mean something else. - Will you stop arguing and go get us some help? - If I go to town, it'll be to buy that dress you promised me. - Yeah, well just hurry up. And while you're at it, you can get me a doctor. - You won't walk outta here? - I promise. - I don't trust you. - Now look, I'm buying you a new dress. In return, you can get me a doctor. - I think that's the only reason you're buying it for me. You don't really want me for your own. - I do. - Well granddaddy used to say I was muley. But you're muley about that doctor, I ain't never had no doctor. My granddaddy didn't either. - Well if he had, he might be alive now. - I can take care of you better than any doc. Fixed plenty of broken legs. (groaning) (playful music) - You got 'em pretty good there. Reckon you might have made it to the highway in a year or two. - Oh come on, Rosalie. You just, you just go get me some help and I promise I'll stay here with you. This time I really mean it. - I don't wanna stay here. - You don't wanna stay here? - I changed my mind. I want to travel. See the world, you and me together. - Well I thought you wanted to stay here and farm this place. - With my new dress, I'll look just right in all the big cities. We'll fix up your car and drive to the ocean. I ain't never seen an ocean. - Are you serious? - I always wanted to go places, I was just scared to do it by myself. - Alright. Okay, look when you're in town, you gotta buy a pump. - What's that? - It's a pump. A pump to pump up the flats. A garage'll sell you one. It'll just cost you a couple of dollars. - You know what, we'll buy a tent. We'll sleep by the side of the yard, it'll be fun. - Great, fabulous. But we better quit wasting time cause you'll never get to town at this rate. - Ah, there's no sense going now, honey. Sun setting. Stores'll all be closed. I'll do it first thing in the morning. You rest real easy now. I'm gonna fix us a real nice supper. - Rosalie. You're gonna get us both killed. (coughing) - What's a matter, Virgil? Is it hurting? - I'm cold. Won't you get another blanket? Rosalie, wait a minute. What are you doing? - Keeping you warm, like I did for granddaddy when he was cold. - Rosalie, you go right back to your bed right now, do you understand? Rosalie. Look, neither one of us is going to get any sleep like this. - I am. - Yeah. Look, I think we should have a little talk. - About? - Education. - What about it? - Well you haven't got one. Don't you wanna learn to read and write? - Yeah, you're gonna teach me. - I am, huh? That's a laugh, you won't even listen to me. - You're so pretty when you're serious. - Yeah? That's great. Just great. - Yeah, you're real pretty. - Well thank you very much, Rosalie. - You warmer now? - Yeah, I'm fine, I'm just fine. - You know I love you. - Oh. (thundering) (rooster crowing) (engine roaring) Oh my god, hey, hey. Hey you. Yeah, hey you, come on, come here. Hey you, right over here. Hey, hey, yeah you, come over here. Hey can you hear me? Come on. Hey you, for crying out loud, can't you hear me? Over here. - They're looking for the Jefferson's place, he took the wrong turn off. - Hey, hey you, hey! Come here. - You're just wearing yourself out. I told him you're sick in the head. He's scared you're gonna kill him if he comes any closer. - Rosalie, when are you gonna get it through your thick little head that Fry's gonna be back here soon? He can help us. - He's gonna help us. He's gonna give me a lift to the highway. I'll be back way before Fry can get here. - But Rosalie, you gotta stop fooling around. Don't forget the tire pump. - How many times you gonna tell me? - Don't shut it. - Can't have you walking around on that bad leg. - Why you locking it? - I want you all fresh to admire my new dress. (engine roaring) Virgil. Virgil, I'm back, I got it. (suspenseful music) (crying) It's me. It's only me. - Where's the pump? - Every time I turn my back, you're running off like some jack rabbit. - Well don't go getting sore again, I wrecked my leg trying to get of the window. - Serves you right. - You left me laying there like a sitting duck, what if Fry'd come back? Least this way, I figure he'd find the place empty, maybe clear out. Will you please help me up? - Next time, I'll nail them windows shut. I can't wait to show you what I got. - Where's the pump? - It's yellow and it's got gold buttons. - The pump, god damn it. Show me the pump. Rosalie. - You're making me mad, Virgil. How would you like me to wrap this thing around your head? - Give it to me. - I may not know much, but I know a person's supposed to say please. - Please, Rosalie. Perfect. Look, I'll teach you how to fix a flat. If we work fast, we can be headed back. Now what are you doing? - I'm showing you my new outfit. - Will you change in the car? That lunatics gonna be back here any minute. Pump the tires up. - I ain't going traveling in that dumb old dress. How do you work this thing? - There, now hurry up. Put your dress on and hurry. Now how you gonna hold your stockings up? - Look fine to me. Wait till you see this. How do I look? (soft music) - I think you've forgotten something. - What? - You can wear that thing without a blouse. - I like it the way it is. I ain't used to too many clothes. You do like it, don't you? - Yeah, you look swell. - Honest? - I never seen anyone prettier. Can we fix the tires now? - You don't think blue woulda suit me better, huh? - I think the color's perfect on you. Now come on, let's go. - You ain't just say that to make me hurry? - It's terrific, it's straight outta Vogue. Now look, Fry's had enough time to get to El Paso or Albuquerque and back here again. Now will you please get going on the tires. - I think you like that stupid old pump more than my dress. Alright, alright, I'm coming, I'm coming. Now you lay down and I'll push you out to the car so you can show me what to do, okay? - Now what the hell are you doing? - Fixing them tires gonna make me all sweaty. Wanna keep my new outfit fresh. Yeah, I think you're right. It would look better with a blouse. - What? - My dress. I don't wanna look dumb in all those places we're going. - Fine, first town we hit, we'll get you a new one. - Is it far to New York? - About 2,000 miles. - Long way. - Oh, with any luck, we'll be having dinner in St. Louis by tomorrow night. I know a restaurant there, it has the greatest fried chicken you've ever eaten. How's the tire coming? - I ain't going one of them places till I learn to eat right. - Forget it then. We'll pick up groceries, we can stop on the roadside for picnics. - I was thinking, what you was saying about educating. Would you buy me some books? Schoolbooks? Teach me to read and write? - Great, I'd love that, you're bright, you'll learn real fast. Keep pumping, keep pumping. - I bet the first thing you'd do when we get out of here is find yourself a doctor, huh? - Oh, Rosalie, don't worry about that, my leg's feeling fine. You did a good job. I thought I'd wait till we got to Harrisburg, my sister's married to a doctor there. They have a kid, you'll love her. You're both about the same age, you'll get along great. I think that one's done now, why don't you start on the other one? - She's probably think it's funny, you showing up with an Indian kid. - Oh, don't be silly. They're my family, they'd accept anybody I showed up with, they'd love you. - Too bad you don't. - They got a swimming pool in the backyard, you'll like it there. - You heard what I said. - What? - You don't love me. - Rosalie, if I didn't love you, why would I wanna take you on this wonderful trip? - So you can dump me at one of them welfare places and come running back here for granddaddy's gold. - I got 10,000 dollars, I got property in Idaho, I got everything I need, what do I need grandpa's gold for? All I want is to make you happy. - Then we stay here. - Rosalie, wait, wait, don't, don't. Oh no. - We can't be happy out there. We can only be happy here. - I thought you wanted to see the ocean? - That was a dream. What I dream and what I get aren't the same. - You understand, as soon as I can walk, I'm gonna walk right away from you. - I'm gonna be so good to you. You'll never wanna go. (engine roaring) Maybe it's that boy again. - Nobody gets lost twice in one day. Quick, get this thing inside, we'll lock ourselves in. Come on. Oh come on. Rosalie, come on, hurry up. - I'm doing the best I can. - Come on, faster. It's stuck on a rock. Turn it, turn it sideways. - I hate that bike. Gotcha. I really gotcha. I was hoping to get one of them (mumbling). No good when your heart's set on something and you don't have it. Buddy, this stuff is junk. - This stuff is gonna look good with my new outfit. You need to see what I got, Fry. - I've seen most of what you've got already. Guy in the jewelry store knew right off. Just stuff a salesman shows around, figured I robbed somebody. You sure pulled a good one there, didn't you? - Hey now look Fry, what do you figure the gold's worth? Whatever you think it's worth, you get me to a bank, I'll get you the cash. Now what do you say? - You know, a bri gets in trouble in this state, it ain't too good. - How do I look? - Jesus. How's that leg, huh? This healing real good? - Yeah. - Hey, come here, Rosalie. I wanna talk to you. - Wait a minute, you. Don't listen to him, Rosalie-- - Shut up, shut up. Come on, I wanna tell you something. Why lookie there, turn around. Oh, that's very charming. Baby, I got a proposition for you. - Don't listen to him, Rosalie. - I told you to shut up. - Hey, you can go with me and I'll fix you up in this place I know, and you can have all the junk you wanna wear. All you gotta do is tell me where the gold is. - [Virgil] Rosalie, don't listen to him. - That's all you gotta do. Where's the gold? - If I go with you, what happens to him? - You tell me where the gold is, kid and I'll tuck him into bed and kiss him goodnight. - [Virgil] Don't tell him. - I told you to shut up. - Oh my god, wait a minute, please. (screaming) (groaning) - Quit it, Fry, quit it. - You got the gold? - It's buried with granddaddy. - Where's the grave? - You're crazy Fry, you could've killed him. - Where's the god damn grave? - By the well. You're hurting me. - Take the shovel and start digging. Dig. - Wish it was you under there. - Hell, you can't do no better than that. - I don't trust that Fry no more. He's aiming to fix you. - Fix me? Look, I don't want you to go away with him. - I gotta go. It's the only way to save you. See, I'm gonna make out like I'm going with him but then as soon as I get a chance, I'll give him the slip and I'll come back and get you. Say you love me. - Rosalie, this is not the time or the place. - I'm just still a kid to you. I'll show you one day. (yelling) (laughs) (mumbling) - That's Bear's gold, Fry. You just better pray he don't come after you. - Look at that. That ain't junk. What you gave me was junk. And I'm gonna balance you for it. - Come on Fry. - I ain't ready yet. Like little boy says, one bad leg deserves another. - You better not, Fry. I'm going with you. - Let's get it on. Jesus, what's that stank? Smells like something crawled up and died all over me. What's brought in with me? - It's Bear. It's Bear, I told you he'd come back for you. (laughs) - Son of a bitch smell better dead than he did alive. Let's leave in a hurry. - I'll see you again. - The hell you will. Get on. (engine roars) (upbeat music) - Rosalie. - Hi, Virgil. - What are you doing here, honey? - Waiting for you. - Come on, as far as you know, I'm still back at the cabin. Where's Fry? - I killed him. - Come on. How'd you get away from him? - I killed him. I took his knife and I shoved it in him. - Are you sure he's dead? - Oh he's dead alright. He's good and dead. - You better show me. - Okay. I had to do it. I had to do it. He was hurting me and hurting me. I had to, I told you I would. I told you I'd kill him if he ever. I'd kill him, I told you. - Alright Rosalie, now no one's gonna hurt you. Nobody's gonna blame you for anything. You just tell the police what happened, I promise, nothing's gonna happen. - I ain't going near any police. - A man is dead, Rosalie. Do you understand? We have to go to the police. Look, there's nothing to be afraid of. I'll be with you the whole time. - I wanna go home. I wanna go home, Virgil, please. Please take me back to the ranch. I wanna go back to the ranch, please Virgil, please. I wanna go. Take me home. Please. - When the hell are you gonna grow up, Rosalie? I told you, I'll stick by you. Now come on. Everything's gonna be alright. - I wanna go home. I wanna go home. I wanna go back to the ranch. If you don't take me back to the ranch, I'll kill you. - I stopped here to help you. My god, you won't let anybody help you. So long, Rosalie. My leg. - Virgil. Virgil, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to. I'm sorry. (honking) Please, please, please. (suspenseful music) - What's a matter Miss? You been in an accident? Are you alright? Don't be afraid, we're here to help you. Who's car is that? What's that guy doing down there? What's wrong with the other fella? Has there been a fight? Young lady, I'm speaking to you, what's going on here? - He did it. He killed him. He killed my boyfriend. (soft music)
