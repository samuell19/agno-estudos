Hail Lord Venkatesa! When you read the newspaper in the morning, all you see is acid attacks on girls and ACB raids on government employees. When you switch on the television, there are long discussions on unnecessary issues. After ignoring all these things when we go to the office, people will scheme to spoil other's work instead of minding their own. Earlier, when someone built a house, others used to help them build it. But now if anyone starts building a house, people are ready to stop it with lawsuits and petitions. There's negativity everywhere. Once I had a doubt. In these modern times, without any motives, using the old model brain, can a true man who believes in God, survive in this materialistic world? This film Namo Venkatesa is an idea that came out of that suspicion. Ramanujam, why are you watching them instead of writing accounts? Look at him! He looks like a well-oiled wild boar. The entire Kurnool can have a feast off of him. And he's going to marry that beautiful angel. What kind of a nasty combination is this? We can't fix combinations, God must do it. Do you still have a doubt? They've made all the arrangements. Even demon Ravana made better arrangements to marry Sita in Ramayana. But he eventually lost her to Ram. - Don't narrate epic tales. - Alright! I'll tell you something which suit's this ambiance. - You've watched the film Okkadu, right? - Yes. Prakash Raj tried every trick to marry Bhoomika. But what happened in the climax? He bites the dust at the hands of Mahesh Babu. What do you mean? If a man wants to get married without the consent of a woman, the marriage doesn't take place. Does that mean this wedding wouldn't take place, as well? Sir, Pooja madam is missing! - See? It happened! - How could you predict it, sir? - It's a formula, Ramanujam! - Just a minute, sir. Father will kill us if he comes to know, go and find her, go! Stop! First, listen to me. My sir isn't an ordinary man. He's Lord Kalki. He's Veerabrahmam who knows the prophecy. He's Lord Sai Baba with a sixth sense. He predicted that something like this will happen. Let's seek his blessings. Let's go, sir. Go! What are you waiting for? Find her! Why did he slap me, sir? Truth is always bitter, Ramanujam. Not everyone can take it. If he reacted so brutally after hearing me out, imagine what his father's reaction will be. How is it possible to have everything that you like, Chengalrayudu? It's fine that you liked my quarry. But does that mean I should sell it to you? It's like... if I ask you to sell it, will you? Some are not for sale. Guruva Reddy is the reason behind your courage, but he's in jail now. Tiger may be in jail. But his cubs, I mean, his men are still around. - Hello? - Suri, madam ran away. Sir, Pooja madam ran away from home. He can't control his women but he wants to control us? People say that we should live happily, but he died happily. Bairagi! You know very little about me. Don't ever try to completely understand me. No matter how much you try, you can't escape from here. You must marry my son and you will. Not even God can stop it. FEW DAYS EARLIER IN HYDERABAD Hey, stop! Stop! - Stop! - Stop! Oh, no! - Oh, my! - Get up, Grandpa. Get up. Careful! Are you fine? Just a minute, son. - My backache is gone. - Gone? Thank you so much. Take your walking stick. Why did you take my crown? It was on my bike and I thought it was my helmet. - Then why are you running away? - Who will run away from you? - There's Srinivasa Rao! - I was running from that crowd. - Come on! - Hey! Stop! Hey, wait! You go that side and the rest follow this side. I'll jump! I won't come down! I'll fix your marriage with the girl you love! Come down, son! You'll promise me now but you will break it later. I'll jump! - No, son... - I'll jump! Son! Thank God! Catch him! ANAND NAGAR COLONY Stop, boys! Why did he enter in Mallesh area? Hey, Soda! Why are you after Venkanna? Do you know what he did, brother? Soda Sambaiah is contesting the assembly election from our constituency. It's an honor for all of us. It's our responsibility to take him from the arrack shop to the assembly. - Hari. - Yes, sir. - Where is he? - I'm also waiting for him, sir. He's here, sir. - We are getting late. - Come quickly. Why did you come so late? My bike broke down, hence the delay. Don't just criticize the opposition, praise me, as well. That's our job, but I don't know about politics. Yes, sir. Brother will start if you put down all your points on the paper. We've your opposition's list, as well. - Is it? Give him ours. - Okay, sir. - Okay, you start. - You go and sit. Bro, I'll find out about your Europe program with Murthy. You come directly to that meeting after this. Give me the list. You're so absent-minded! Bye, brother. Boys! You must clap whenever he mentions my name. The audience will follow it. Greetings to all of you. It's my habit to start any program with a prayer. Because there shouldn't be any power break or rain, and nobody must die of electrocution. Get ready, boys! Hail Lord Venkatesa! It isn't my intention to belittle other Gods by only mentioning Venkatesa. Everyone is great in their own way. - For example... - Be ready, boys! - Lord Ganesha... is he any less? - Stop talking... about Gods and talk about me. Due to the paucity of time, I couldn't cover all Gods. Today, I'm going to introduce you to a very important man. Be ready, boys! Chitti Babu! Though he's very short, he's very smart. He's going to give us a few facts about a man. - That man is none other than... - Be ready, boys. He is none other than Soda Sambaiah. Fifth day is... Oh, God! The file got exchanged! Don't know what situation he must be in! Hurry, take a U-turn! Chitti Babu! Tell us about Soda Sambaiah! He rose from very meager beginnings. He used to steal pencils and chalk pieces from classmates. You mean, he was like Lord Krishna! Why is telling all this? He's taking the lead, there must be something, sir. Everybody does mischievous things in their childhood. Tell me something else. He used to sell film tickets illegally in theaters. Should I tell you about that? Illegal tickets? What do you mean, Chitti Babu? He used to circulate counterfeit notes too! Shall I tell you that? Counterfeit notes? Why are you so shocked? He used to traffic women to Gulf. Shall I tell you about that, as well? Don't rush, there are people here. He must be on to something. No! Soda Sambaiah isn't like that. I will vote for him. If you vote for him, then you're doomed. No man with a sane mind will vote for him after hearing this. - Then? - They will throw stones at him. There must be something, sir. Oh, my! Why are they throwing stones here instead of there? Soda Sambaiah. Brother, you have the wrong file, run! They may kill us if we stay here. Let's escape! Catch him! Take care of Chitti Babu. They may throw stones if I don't deliver the dialogues properly. Anjaneya, where is my Sita? Raju, your crown! Hey, wait! My crown! So, he removed gas from your Soda! You're laughing at us? Who do you think Venkanna is? He's the incarnation of Lord Venkateshwara. The Lord made our Venkanna say the truth. To hell with logic! Hand him over to me. Or else, I know how to take him with me. Hey! - He's finished! - What did you say? - Will you take Venkanna? - Yes, I will. - Will you dare touch my Venkanna? - Yes, I will. - Idiot! - Scolding a future MLA?! I don't care who you are! Come here! How dare to touch my Venkanna?! He has dishonored me in public. Aunty! Stop! Leave him. It's not his fault. He spent a lot of money to arrange the meeting. It went awful because of me. He's angry and that's why he's after me. - Calm down. That's all, you go. - That's all. I'll leave. See you, Mallesh brother. Sister, control your blood pressure. I meant your health. You go, sir. Aunty, he's right. You should control your BP. Okay, I will. Narayana, you asked me to come immediately. Have you fixed any alliance for our Venkanna? He'll never get married, so we've decided to go on a pilgrimage. That's what we came to tell you. What's this, Uncle? Your father left you in my care. That responsibility has become a burden for me now. What happened? You raised him as a gentleman. Just raising him isn't enough. I've been searching for brides for him since he was 20 years old. Earlier, many proposals came, just like the rain in the monsoon season. Later, he got fewer proposals, just like the rain in the summer season. Now they have stopped coming, just like the drought. Uncle, life is like a farm and we are like amaranths in it. We can cook curry with it, but we can't make sambar or rasam, can we? Why are you talking about some unrelated topic while we are talking about marriage? There is a connection, Auntie. I told you I won't get married until I find my dream girl, right? He has been saying this since I was young. Where can I find his dream girl? I'll know it. Like a warning before a cyclone, there will be few changes in me when I see her. When she comes to me, the fragrance of roses will surround me. Not only that, I'll feel like the sun is shining 1000 times brighter. If the sun is near you, you'll meet death, not the girl. I understand your frustration. Actually, a delay in marriage is good for us. It's good? It will be a girl who comes to our home, not a chick. She'll come with millions of wishes. That's why I bought furniture along with a flat to keep her happy. The Nano car will be here in a few days. I'm ready for marriage. I'm just waiting to meet my dream girl. Did you see, brother? He always comes back to the dream girl. I think he'll never marry in this life. Come, let's go. Don't worry, sit down. Maybe there's a defect in his horoscope. Let's consult an astrologer. What's this, priest? You've been studying his horoscope for an hour now. I'm not studying, Mallesh. I'm searching. The date of birth he gave isn't matching with the horoscope. I got it. - Which date of birth did you give him? - December 13th. - Which year? - Every year! - Don't act smart. - Why are you fighting? He mentioned it as 1985. - Why is he slapping himself like that? - He does that whenever he lies. Will anyone beat you if you tell the truth? Why are you wasting my time? - I'll tell you the truth, priest. - Stop, I'll tell him. - You were born at that time? - Why? Is that bad? You can at any time. Is this your correct date of birth? - I only lie once. - You have a rule for lying as well. Now it's matching! Thank God! Will I marry my dream girl? All the planets are in one place like in a picket, and it's clumsy, as well. - Can I tell you the date again? - There's no need, dear. Then, tell me, when will I get married? There's no clarity in your horoscope just like the Polavaram project. Priest! Just say that you can't read it. Please don't play with a young man's life with your half-baked knowledge. He's very emotional, he's using words like a young man. He's doubting my knowledge, Mallesh. Nothing like that. He got a little irritated and spoke like that. Calm down and tell us what the issue is. Okay, Malli. He'll go abroad soon. You're right. You're God fearing. You're right again. Your marriage is as suspenseful as these things. What should I do to break this suspense? - I trust shells at such times. - I trust you. I'll put down these shells after shaking them. If all shells fall flat, you'll get married. If not, you'll not get married. What if half of them are in favor and the other half aren't? You'll be stranded. Malli, there's a limit to everything. He keeps blabbering! Come on, shake the shells. I'll do it, madam. Don't blow over it. We mustn't write the horoscope. We must read what's already written. What's the meaning of this, priest? Your nephew may remain single like the shell. Please don't say that, try again. That will be wrong. We mustn't go against nature. No, you didn't shuffle it well. Isn't it, Auntie? He's asking you, right? Why don't you do it again? Don't get angry, madam. I'll do it again. - No big deal. I'll do it again. - He's doing it again. More! More! You do it. Oh, God! The wires are burning! Did you see the result of going against nature? How is it connected to this event? Lights shouldn't have blown up because of the horoscope. Do you want my home to blow up? - What shall we do now? - Let me take a photo. You sit down, dear. - I need the combination of the shells. - Why? Has anyone seen a shell standing upright? We thought that the black hole is a wonder, this is more wonderful than it. You have a photogenic face. You can get up now, Ramana. I didn't believe the TV9 report about the world ending soon. But these instances are making me believe it now. He must get married in one month. Or else, there's no chance of marriage in his entire life. There's one more thing. Soon, you are going to meet a bad person who's been affected by a malefic planet. And it will bring a dramatic change in your life. - Mom, I've learned a new magic trick. - What's it, son? First, give me one egg. Yeah, drop it here. Now, watch. Abracadabra... Hey! There are two now! Very good! Show it to your dad, even he will enjoy it. Oh, Mom! It's useless to show those who don't know the value of art. Hubby! What are you watching so seriously on TV in the morning? Have coffee, please. Hubby! Please have your coffee. Hubby! Hubby! Hey, Pappi! Hubby! Oh, no! Hubby! Oh, no! Mom! What happened? Why are you crying? Your father is dead. He has left us. Just now he was eating breakfast like a hungry swine! Why are you crying, Mom? Will your weeping bring back my dead father? Think practically, Mom! Should we cremate him here or take the body to India? He died happily. Stop talking like that, son. You do so many magic tricks, right? Do something and bring him back to life. - Magic? - Please, son! Okay! I'll try my level best. Why did you throw him down? Mom, please don't disturb me. This is the treatment. - Don't beat that hard, he may die. - He's already dead. There's a chance of reviving him by beating him. - Is it? - This is known as pumping treatment. Then, beat him. Beat him! - It was a success! - Hey! - Mom, it was a success! - What happened? You were dead. Pappi immediately gave you the pumping treatment to revive you. I would have really died in a few more shots. - I'll immediately... - Stop! Have I attained puberty that you're informing all the relatives about it? Why were you silent when your mother was crying profusely? - I did cry, Dad. - Don't lie to me. Did you think that I didn't see it? You were dead. How could you see it? So, what if I'm dead? Will the soul directly go to heaven? It'll check who's mourning and who's not and then leave. - Is Pooja awake? - Shall I wake her up? Don't wake her up. She is a fatherless child, let her sleep. By the way, artists are coming tomorrow from India to perform at a program. - We should also go along with them. - You told us last night. Why are you still here then? Pack your bags immediately. Dad! You felt sad because I didn't mourn your death, right? I'll surely mourn the next time you die. - Hi, how are you? - Stupid! Lord of Seven Hills, you know the one-month deadline set by the astrologer. You can fix it anywhere if you decide. Please hurry, Lord. Hail Lord Venkatesa! - What's this? - Don't you know? That's why I'm asking you. Mark on the forehead, conch and discuss, a blessing hand and a gesture. Hail Lord Venkatesa! Are we here to pray or to perform? To pray and perform. Are you taunting me? Do you know me? I'm single leg dancer Shake Raj. Have you seen Prabhu Deva's reaction to my performance on a TV show? Did he cuss at you for daring to dance without knowing a single step? - Hey! What did you say? - I didn't, it was Chitti Babu. Say sorry to him. Brother? My foot! He looks like a buffalo in a dress. - Don't say that. - Yes. - Buffaloes may get offended by it. - Correct. Have you two going to do a joint act? - If I get angry... - What will you do, you fool? - How dare you call me a fool! - Stop! Venky! What's wrong? Chitti Babu and brother are fighting, not me. - What's this, Shake Raj? - Hands off! Are you fighting with dolls as well? They say, "Control your tongue and everything will be fine." I know how to behave, I don't need your advice. You'll never change. Are we here to sing a devotional song in the temple or to perform in Europe? Songs must be fast. - What do you mean? - What do you mean? -We'll shatter -We will -We'll create magic -We will -We'll change the world -We will No locks for our mouths Once hooked, you're finished These are our achievements And felicitations What's this nonsense? If you split up, how can I gather all of you? Everyone should be together, right? We are practicing, Mr. Murthy. Hey! If you sing like a buffalo, - the police will arrest you. - Buffalo? - This is foreign, guys! - It's not right, bro. You shouldn't insult your fellow artists like this. Look, Venky is very humble despite his talent. You ignorant fool! What did you say? Sorry, the most foolish among fools. Why are you trying to hit our boss? - I'll punch you! - Wait, boys! I'll kill him with this. Why are you fighting amongst yourselves? All artists must stand united. Take your passports. My wife thought I was dead and banged her head on the wall. She has swelling now! Do you know what I did? My wife set an alarm at 5:00 a.m. for offering special prayers. I changed it to 2:00 a.m. When she got up and started praying and ringing bells, the neighbors woke up and yelled at her. Greetings, sir. Murthy, what are your tour plans? Mani Sharma will come to Frankfurt, Keeravani will come to Zurich, Devi Sri Prasad will come to Berlin directly. We'll take our artists to and fro from that place. I've already booked the train tickets also. That's okay, what about the remuneration? - It's just peanuts. Two lakh rupees each. - Two lakh rupees? Peanuts? Ask them to come in. I want to interview them. - You mean... - Is everything ready? It's due to this sadism, that we are losing the artists. Do you know that I really worked hard to get them? Shouldn't we know what they will perform on the stage? Peter, send them one by one. Hello. Thank you. Hey! Don't you know that you should open the door while entering? I thought you opened it out of respect. I was just checking the size of the handle. Is the size okay? - It's okay. - Perfect. What's your talent? Banging on doors! No, I'm a dancer. There's nothing great in it. Anyone can do it nowadays. - Do you know my specialty? - What is it? - I dance on a single-leg. - Really? - We want to see that single leg dance. - I'll give you a chance. - Can I? - Take it. Thank you. I think this is mango juice, right? Exactly. - Music! - Yeah! One, two, three Waiting for single leg dance, right? Yes. - Can you stop the music? - Stop. What happened, man? My stomach is upset. Where's the bathroom? - Is it urgent? - It's very urgent. - Sign this. - What's that? Do you want to go to the bathroom or not? I need to go to the bathroom first, I'll come back and sign. - Sign it and then go. - Damn it! - Give it. - Here is the pen. - Which way? - Take a left and go straight. Oh, it's so long! The full and final settlement is over. The cost for using the bathroom is two lakh rupees. Next. Why is he praying? Sorry, sir. What were you doing at the door, sir? I was checking the size of the door handle. - Is it okay, sir? - Perfect! - My name is Venkatramana. - I'm Paris Prasad. Glad to meet you. Did you feel anything, sir? Did you feel anything? I felt something unusual upon touching your hand. But there's no clarity. You will have clarity in the future. Sit. - Thank you, sir. - By the way, what's your talent? Ventriloquism, sir. Did you come all the way from there to pluck hair? It's not plucking hair but ventriloquism. I think you don't know. I'll give you a demo. Chitti Babu, it seems like they aren't aware of it. Greet them. Good morning, Mr. Prasad. How do you do? Two lakh rupees for this doll's play? Mr. Murthy, I gave my dates only after you accepted the price, right? You know that my name is Venkatramana, don't you? It's God's name. If anyone tries to cheat me, they will get cheated upon. Why are you threatening us emotionally? We felt like you were asking for more. Is it wrong? You don't know my track record. That's why you feel like that. I'll show you now. If you see my details, all your doubts will be cleared. We'll see that later. Have this juice first. I'll have it later. You pay us. So, you have the right to doubt my talent. It's my responsibility to clear it. This is me with Mr. Chandrababu Naidu. Do you know what he said? "You did a great job, Venkateshwarlu. Though the farmers are not getting the right price for their crops, those who run your program easily get their money back. So, I wish you a great future." Do you know what late Mr. YSR said about me? "Mr. Roshaiah, just like how they come to rescue people, when the people call on 108, if we call Venky, even he comes very fast on his bike. That's not it. He makes you laugh until you have tears in your eyes. For such a talented man, it won't be wrong to give an extra 100 rupees." Do you mimic as well? Not just mimicry, I also write poetry and sing songs. Recently, I wrote a song describing my dream girl. - Wherever I sing it, people applaud. - Is it? Sorry, Venkatramana. We felt that two lakh rupees was too much without knowing your talent. But now, I feel it's too less. - Have some juice. - Elders first. Young man, you have it now. Not that one, it's sugarless, Take this one. - Okay, thanks. - Welcome. - Sign this. - What is it, sir? The agreement. Correct, it's very important. You can read it later, sign it first. - Inauspicious time will start soon. - Sir, it's messed up. I think the glass was exchanged. Sir, look. You haven't paid me a penny, right? - It says here that everything is paid. - Let's discuss it later. No, sir. We must see it now, or else you may feel sorry for your mistake. - I think it may come out here only. - What is it? - Toilet. - Toilet? First correct this agreement, or else inauspicious time will start. - You said it just now, didn't you? - It'll take time, man! No need, sir. I have a copy ready. I'm very careful about such things. Here's the agreement, sign it. - Stop! - Why? - Read it once. - I can't now. - It's just 24 pages. - Twenty-four pages? I can't. Then, I'll read it for you, you listen. Come. I am begging you. Please tell him. Venky, let him sign it, he says it's very urgent. Get it over with. Careful. Slowly... right there. Where is he? Maybe it was really urgent. - How did the glasses get changed? - Auntie, I'm fine here. There was a small mistake in the agreement. I checked and corrected it. I'm just concerned about your wedding. Don't worry about my wedding, it'll happen when the time comes. We are leaving this place tomorrow. I'll call you once I reach. I forgot to tell you, ask Uncle to walk regularly. - Now he'll learn his lesson. - You're not an ordinary man. Bye. Why is he leaving without looking for his bag? He'll feel the heat once he knows that he has lost it. - Our agreement is in this, right? - Yes. Why is he keeping our photos? Is this his suitcase? - Mr. Johnson! - Mr. Johnson! - Sir, please spare us. - Mr. Johnson. Please, sir. Give us some time. Hey! What happened? These bloody rogues tried to steal my briefcase and run away. What is he saying? He says that these crooks stole his suitcase. - Why do you need his suitcase? - Mistook it for your suitcase and... Shut up! Don't hit him. Please stop. What happened? You scoundrels! You've taken two crores credit from our bank. If you don't pay, I'll put you in jail. What did he say now? They have taken a two crore rupees loan from our bank. If they don't repay, he'll send them to jail, scoundrels! What I mean by scoundrels is... that they are rogues! You translate very well like Undavalli Arunkumar. Go away! - Your nose is... - Get out! - Seems like it's hurting. - Just get lost! You stole the suitcase thinking it was Venky's, right? Are you wondering how I know this? He said he's named after God, right? Anyone cheating on him will get cheated. Everybody here, ladies and gentlemen. Now, watch this. This is the coke and this is the glass. See this. Abracadabra. Ta-da! Very nice, boy! Clap for him, artists need encouragement. Do you know what happened yesterday? My husband died. My son revived him with his magic. Tell everyone! Announce it on the public system. What's the matter with you? Why are you scolding my mom? What did I say now? Mr. Prasad, we are getting late for the train. Your people promised to come but they didn't show up. Are they coming or not? I'll hit you with my shoe! Do you know who they are? Are they commoners? Can't you wait for them? Wait for them. - Hey, Suppi! - Here, Mom. I didn't have this feeling before My heart is sprinting As my eyes came to know about this They started to script dreams Your glare told me what's inside me My heart is not with me My dear sweetheart has arrived And extended a hand of friendship - Hi, Uncle! - Hi. Why are you late? Senseless girl. - Sorry, Auntie. Actually... - You keep quiet. No need to apologize. You're a fatherless child. If not this train, we'll catch another one. You carry on. Uncle, you're so sweet. - Come, let's go. - Give it to me. - It's okay, Uncle. - No problem, I'll bring it. You carry on. - Why are you shouting at her? - No, you misunderstood. Shut up! You and that fat boy carry it. It'll be like an exercise for you. Your father left this luggage for us to carry. Come, let's take it. Oh my God! How are you tolerating such a man? - It's my fate, son. Come. - Excuse me. - Yes? - Can you help me? - Crazy man! - Let's carry them ourselves, son. Why are you carrying it? Give it to me. - You go, I'll bring them. - Thank you, son. Thank you, brother. Look, kid. Respecting women is our tradition. Anyone who makes them carry weight is not a man at all. Oh, Venky! You touched my heart. - You will be my lifelong friend. - Same to you. As I didn't have this feeling before My heart is sprinting My dear sweetheart has arrived And extended her friendship... As my eyes came to know about this They started the scripting of dreams Uncle, they had many plans for the holidays, but I convinced them to join you by promising that it would be more fun. - I don't know what you will do. - Don't worry, dear. If the program is boring, you can go shopping. If the journey is boring, I've paid them well to entertain you. - Will they perform here too? - They will perform anywhere... Bro, why are you treating your niece like a princess? Not just treatment. She is indeed a princess. She's worth hundreds of crores. She can solve Johnson's problem with a snap of a finger. - Look there, the location is awesome. - Hey, Srinivas. Yes, sir. Why are you enjoying the sights like a paid tourist? What do you want me to do, sir? - Showcase your talent. - Okay. I didn't get a chance in the interview. - Definitely! Come on, boys. - Okay, sir. For a change, we've practiced a Tamil classical song. - Can I present it? - Okay. - Go away! - Okay. Hold this. - Hey, Venkatramana. - Sir. You mentioned a song about your dream girl? - Yes, sir. - Sing! I'll sing, sir. The time has come at last. Soundarya... Who is this Soundarya? - My dream girl's dummy name. - Oh! Soundarya... Soundarya, you are the epitome of a smile You met me in a dream As if it was true, Soundarya My sweetheart! My sweetheart! My sweetheart! My sweetheart! Soundarya! Soundarya, you are the epitome of a smile You met me in a dream As if it was true, Soundarya Soundarya! Soundarya, you are the life of my song You made my heart Sing a song of love, Soundarya Soundarya embodies Telugu culture Soundarya is the personification Of naughtiness I kept staring at you and fell in love Oh, dear! You are my companion Breathe life into my thoughts And come to me, my sweetheart Oh, dear! You are my companion Breathe life into my thoughts And come to me, my sweetheart My sweetheart! My sweetheart! Shall I call the glitter on your lips As jasmine or Indian Jui, my love? Shall I call the gleam That's cutting my heart? As moonlight or dawn? No metaphor can match or compare to you Won't brushes hang heads down In shame, unable to paint you? Oh, dear! You are my companion Breathe life into my thoughts And come to me, my sweetheart Oh, dear! You are my companion Breathe life into my thoughts And come to me, my sweetheart I believe with hope That you're born for me I'm waiting to welcome you Hoping that you'd come to my side How can I keep my yearning inside me? Receive this message I'm sending through the air Oh, dear! You are my companion Breathe life into my thoughts And come to me, my sweetheart - Uncle, I've got good news. - What is it? - I saw my dream girl. - Really? Who is she? Her name is Pooja. It's nice, right? She's the niece of our organizer, Paris Prasad. I have decided to marry her. You've decided. But what about her decision? She will agree. Don't be suspicious, Uncle. We don't have much time. You do one thing. There will be a summer sale in Kalamandir. Go with your aunt, and buy bridal costumes and jewels. He'll give you an additional discount if you tell him my name. Bye. This isn't Eluru but Europe. - Hey! I've got Venky in the trap. - How? He is in love with my niece. In that case, you're trapped! - But my niece doesn't love him. - So? I'll make him believe that she also loves him and play a game with him. - This is a good idea. - That is Paris Prasad. - Yeah! - Mr. Prasad. What's this, sir? They are here to perform. Why are you playing with their lives? - Murthy, you are here! - Yes. - Why don't you change your cell phone? - My sentiments are attached to it. - Is this your son's photo? - Yes, sir. I swear on your son, if you tell anyone about this... Take care of your mobile. Let's go. Bloody sadist! How dare you swear on a child! - What?! I am his dream girl? - He didn't stop at that. He spoke to his family and made arrangements for the wedding as well. Is he mad? He is almost mad. Such people don't care about others' feelings. If you pretend he's your dream boy, his dreams, desires, and wishes will come alive in visuals. It will be a lot of fun for us! Why should we play with his emotions, Uncle? Let it go. That's the problem with girls like you. You want entertainment, but you don't cooperate with exciting ideas. You tell her. Hey, Pooja! It's interesting. Let's play the game. No, poor man... You promised us entertainment. - So, entertain us. - Exactly! - You must! - You must! Okay. - Who stole your heart? - Who swept you off? - Is it the girl in jeans? Tell us! - Is it the girl with dimples? Did you see? Stop it. - She is Pooja, my niece. - Greetings. Hi. Ever since she heard your song, she has become your fan. She wanted to talk to you. That's why I brought her here. - Only if you don't mind. - Why would I mind? Tell me. Uncle, not here... Pooja, I got it. Girls, you head to the restaurant. You... you wanted to say something, right? Yeah. You know Venky, today is the most memorable day in my life. And I don't think I'll ever forget this day. Anyway, are you married? Yes. What?! - You are married?! - Which fool told you that? You said it just now! Oh! I said yes in a state of absentmindedness. Now, in a clear state of mind, I assure you that I'm unmarried. Thank God! Why are you happy if he's not married? - I don't get you. - I got it. By the way, Mr. Venky, how old are you? What's your age? Age? There's a lot of controversy around it. So, leave it. What is it? My parents didn't record the correct date. But I remember one thing. The film Prema Desam was released on the day of my tenth grade exams. Was it Prema Desam or Prema Sagaram? There's no confusion. I remember Prema Desam with Vineeth and Abbas very well. I remember the song "Mustafa" as well. I think I was around 26, 27 or 28. Oh! But you look so young. What's the secret? Unnecessarily I reduced too many years. There's no secret. It's just my food habits. I follow MS Raju's guidelines. MS Raju? Mr. Manthena Sathyanarayana Raju. He advises only eating raw food. For example, raw green leafy vegetables, raw vegetables, raw almonds, raw cashew nuts, raw green grams, raw pigeon peas, and raw peas. - He advises eating all food raw. - Really? Rule number two is to eat on time. Oh! Just a minute. We should chew pounded dry fruits at this time. I never miss it no matter where I am. If you follow this, you'll always be young and fresh. It means like you, right? I lose track of time when talking to you, Venky. Seriously! - Enough of it. - I'm telling the truth. - Uncle will get angry, let's go now. - Come on! Okay. Okay, Venky. See you later. - Take care, bye. - Bye. - Bye. - Bye. Venky. - Did you call me? - No! Oh! It felt like you called me. Sorry, bye. Bye. The reason for you to feel like that is the chemical reaction taking place between us and the big change that's taking place in you is nothing but love. How should I tell you, my dear? His face is shining like a bulb -Something unexpected has happened -Something unexpected has happened His heart has exploded like a bomb Troubles have increased We know it. - Your dream girl is Pooja, right? - Leave me alone. - He's feeling shy. - Hey! Prema Desam was released on the day I wrote my tenth grade exams. I was around 26, 27 or 28! Raw cashews, raw vegetables. Rule number two... is to eat on time! I have never laughed so much in my life, Uncle. That's why we will have more fun if you cooperate with me. When your gaze first touched me, chaos ensued with thousands of drums. Lightning at the end of your hand made the cool breeze turn into a cyclone. My breath turned heavy and my jaw tightened with your touch. Without love, my heart had become a cemetery. While my heart was having labor pain for love, it turned into normal delivery with your arrival... While my heart was having labor pain for love, I felt it was a normal delivery with your arrival, my love. Venky. Sir. - Sorry, did I disturb you? - No, sir. Tell me. It's nothing, Venky. Pooja is on cloud nine after talking to you. - What did you do? - We know what he has done. I feel like flying in the air I feel like my heart is bursting - Shut up! - Sir, I want to talk to you alone. Tell me, Venky. It's okay. They are my men. It's a family matter. - Family matter means the issue is severe. - Will you keep quiet? Will you please let us talk for some time? Please, go away. - I feel like flying in the air... - Tell me, Venky. - Actually, it's... - Hi, bro! Can I show you some magic? To hell with your magic! Go away. Look at you, guineafowl! - What?! - He can stay. He's our family. - Yeah. - Okay, carry on. Well, I... I told you about my dream girl, right? I sang about her too. It's none other than your niece Pooja. Venky! Sir, don't get angry. Please, listen to me. Why should I listen to you? How can you choose my niece as your dream girl? There's a reason for that, Mr. Prasad. I knew the moment I saw her at the railway station that she's my dream girl. I kept it a secret in my heart. But after talking to her, I felt she too has feelings for me. That's why I bravely shared my feelings with you. When you believe it's love, regardless of what she says, you think she feels the same. However, facing reality reveals that women's words hold a different meaning. Oh, Dad! Don't be so negative! Venky is a nice guy. His love will definitely succeed. They say children's words are akin to God's words. If you cooperate with me, I'll operate the rest. If you kids like each other, what more could we ask for? I wish you all the best, my child. Venky, cheer up, man! You're gonna make it! He says if you cooperate, I'll operate. Bro, look there! Scapegoat number two! Today is the most memorable day in my life, Shake Raj. - Me too! - And your chain... is so stylish. - Can you dance? - Oh, sure. - Single leg dance. - Oh! By standing on a single leg? That's my specialty. Cool! - I can do classical as well. - Amazing! Do you want to see? See you. - Bye. - Bye. What's this, Prasad? You say your niece loves Venky. But what is she doing with Shake Raj? - That's what confuses me. - I got it. She possesses a vast amount of property. Perhaps she considered that Venky isn't on her level and decided against it. Additionally, it's perfectly understandable for her to desire a modern man like Shake Raj, given her foreign education. No, Venky is very sensitive. If he learns about this, he may get depressed. And it'll turn into frustration, which could lead to perversion. And I fear that he may ruin his life in sorrow. Hi, bro. What's up? What happened? Why are you so dull? It's nothing, dear. No. You're hiding something from me. Tell me, what's it? Your cousin Pooja appears to be very wealthy. I don't follow. Isn't she very rich? Oh, does that matter to you? Bro, rich and poor is the best combination for love. For example, in the film Titanic, Kate Winslet is a very rich girl. And Leonardo DiCaprio is a poor guy, but a nice guy like you. Your love will be as successful as that film. It's good to hear what you say, but Shake Raj has become my competitor. He's very stylish. That crazy bugger! There's no comparison between your and his personalities. You are a macho man! But your hairstyle, body language and your dressing sense... You must change all of that. The girl has given a green signal to love Break the coconut, boy! Your heart hit a jackpot Bro, go for the top gear You're my Angelina I'm crazy about you Oh, my sweet boy I'm your partner Babe, you're my color Here, take this rose Love said to sing duets With you and dance You are my handsome hunk I'll plant a kiss on your cheek My heart is asking to love and marry you Don't trust him He's a cheat Don't go after him He's having a bad time Don't go overboard, you fool If you do, you'll get in trouble I'll become a prince without a fort If you're with me Every day is a festival, my love My heart would be brave Even in hostile regions But when you're with me It is yearning for you Oh, beauty! You cat-walked into my heart The highway asked me To do a moonwalk to seek you Don't fall into his trap Don't cheat yourself Let him burn with envy You go and have a blast with her This is the right time and right place I got a chance May I take over you, honey? My eyes are bewildered And my heart is moved The pulse is racing May I forget everything with you? Facing east And by leaving your shyness behind Give me my first kiss, my dear It's hot on the beach side because of you Don't let me down Don't punch a hole in my heart You are a specimen If you mess with them We'll knock your teeth out Hey, Pappi! What happened? What are you saying, Mr. Prasad? - Are you sure? - Yes, Mr. Shake Raj. My niece's favorite earring fell in the water. I told her I would retrieve it, but she insisted that her Shake Raj would get it. Although she is close to Venky, she expects me to endanger my life. - Let Venky jump. I can't. - Wait... Just a minute. Mad boy! She was getting close to him just to tease you. What do you mean? A girl would have fun teasing the man she loves, right? Hey! I misunderstood her unnecessarily. Now that you've understood, jump! Why put my life at risk? I don't know how deep it is! Do you know the depth of love? Didn't you dive in? Treat it alike and take the plunge. - Give me your passport. - Why do you want the passport? - It'll get wet. - Why will it get wet? That's why! I don't know how to swim. Bro, he doesn't know how to swim. He might die. If anything happens to him, we'll be in trouble. What to do now? Help! Hey, Shake Raj! Catch it! Help! Come on! Come. Give me your hand. Come. Thanks, bro. You saved my life. Will you commit suicide because Pooja is showing interest in me? - No, actually... - Shut up! Don't say anything! The current serious problem may appear silly in the future. - It's already silly to me. - Good. Think of it as silly. It'll ease your pain. - Did you see Pooja? - No. Okay, I'll find her. But you be careful. I wanted to tell him that they pushed me, but he's not listening. Bloody crooks! Where the hell are they? How could they believe a beautiful girl like Pooja would love these fools? They believed it and that's why we are playing with them. Hey! Bloody cheats! How dare you toy with artists abroad! I'll tell this to Venky. Tell him... Tell him that they took your passport and threw it into the river. What are you saying? They'll shoot you if you roam without a passport in this country. It's up to you now. Sir, I'll not tell this to anyone. Please return my passport. I'll return it after the program is over. Till then watch the game. Oh, no! Stop! Hold on! I have a plan for Venky. What's wrong, Venky? Look at him! He's beating a fallen guy like a butcher. Pooja too feels the same. That's why I've got your name registered to knock him down. How can I knock him down? Leave him. His sins will be his own punishment. Don't worry about his sins, but if you don't do it, Pooja will never be yours. - What are you saying? - What else can he say? If a rich girl like Pooja has to accept a poor man like you, - you should show your specialty. - Yeah. But I... No excuses. We've already registered your name. If you don't go, they will take you by force. It's better for you to go than face that situation. - Come on... - Come, man! Poor guy fell into the trap for love -Poor guy -Take positions! Are you ready? Hail Lord Venkatesa! Hey! What's wrong with him? Pooja. Uncle, why did Venky enter the ring? I made him enter with the promise that if he wins, you'll love him. What if anything happens to him? Nothing will happen. They will beat him up and then leave him. Enjoy the fun! Come on. The next fight is between you and you. Ready? Go! Sister! Poor Venky! He might retaliate if we support him. Come on, Venky! You can do it. Sister, please encourage him! Come on, Venky! You can do it. - Come on, Venky! - Yes, you can. Come on, Venky! You can do it! Come on, Venky! Go! You can do it! Yes! One, two... - One, two, three! Out! - What a knock-out punch! He's the winner! Wow! - Super! - Venky won! Sister, notice how he took him down with your encouragement? That is the power of love! Hey, Venky! I'm coming. He is very sincere. We've committed a great mistake. We shouldn't continue it. Pooja, I've got another brilliant idea to play with Venky. Uncle, that's enough! We've made a big mistake by playing with his emotions. I don't have the courage to look into his eyes and confess that it was all a joke, not love. You talk to him and make him understand. Okay, dear. It was all for your amusement, and I hold no personal grudge. I'll explain it to him. You go. May I tell him? Will you? He'll thrash you! Did you see how he knocked out the wrestler? But you promised to tell him. We promise many things. We promised to pay Johnson next week! But will we? - Mr. Prasad. - What's the update on your love story? - I'm confused, sir. - Why? Pooja used to always greet me with a smile. - Did she greet you with tears? - She left without talking to me. Understanding a woman's heart is incredibly challenging. - Pooja is walking away, right? - Yes. If she turns around to look at you, it means your love is a success. - If not? - Then it's a failure. Why add to my tension? What can I do? So many films have this scene. - Do you really mean it? - Yes, I do. Hail Lord Venkatesa! Sorry, Venky. Now that Pooja didn't turn around, don't let yourself get depressed and transform it into frustration, which could lead to perversion. Sir! - What is it? - Look over there! What happened? Nothing happened. I told him everything. You carry on. Sir, I'm extremely happy! - Because I stepped on a nail? - No, sir. My love became a success. I'm also very happy. To celebrate it, I'm throwing a party tonight. Oh, you are so sweet, sir. I must immediately tell this to my people. Why are you throwing a party for his love success? Party, my foot! In the name of the party, I'll get him drunk. I'll strip him naked and take his photos. Blackmail him to upload it on the web and make him fall at our feet. We won't pay them any money. - And finally the photos... - Will you return them? I'll upload it on the website. Mr. Prasad is really great. He's throwing a party for my love success. - I have a doubt. - Be positive. - Where's your glass, Venky? - I don't drink. What? We had big plans for you. How could you not? Big plan? I mean how can you refuse drinks at a party thrown in your honor? I had a drink once in my life and that's enough. This will be your second time. My foot! If I drink, Mr. Sundaram, the doctor, and Uncle Joseph will show up. Calm down! How can they appear? They appeared when I had my first drink. That's why I swore not to drink again in life. I beg you. You must have a drink. - You must drink! - Alright. I'll have milk if you insist. Where can we get milk now? - How about having some juice? - I'll have a full bottle. - Enough. - Let me pour some more. He must get high in one sip! Hey! You're adding a drink to the juice. Who is the scapegoat? Do you want our plan or your passport? Keep your plan to yourself and give me my passport. Then shut your mouth! Go! Here is your juice. Thank you, sir. You too have a drink. Venky, you claimed you could handle many bottles, but you gave up so easily. - Good morning, Mr. Sundaram. - Mr. Sundaram? He said they'll appear if he drinks, didn't he? Oh! What's happening, Venky? What brings you here? - I want to talk about Sailaja. - Which Sailaja? - Sailaja, your student with cat-like eyes. - Oh! Was it Sailaja who was as sexy as Sneha Ullal? When it comes to a student, should you value intelligence or beauty? What's wrong with that? Admiring beauty is my hobby. Moreover, I'm young. How dare you slap your teacher?! The one who ruins a girl's life is not a teacher. Why is he slapping him? They spiked his drink, and now he's on a roll. - Oh, my! - Brother! Leave me. Venky brother, Sundaram master has my TC and he won't give it to me. To hell with your TC! Get out! Why are you shouting at the student if he's asking for TC? - Wait, I'll give it! - Give it. Take it. I gave it, is that all? Why are you shouting at me? Don't you have manners? You're acting as if you have a high BP! BP! BP! BP! Doctor uncle! I'm not your doctor uncle! - You're my doctor uncle. - No. - You're my doctor uncle. - I said I'm not! Accept it, or else he may kill you. Say yes, man! Okay, I'm your doctor uncle, so what? What did you do when we brought my friend Ramakrishna to you with a leg injury? What did I do? I operated on him free of cost and gave him free medicines as well. - Did you do it for free? - Yes. - Yes? - Yes. How dare you lie! You refused to operate without the fee and became the reason for his amputation. Please don't beat him, he may die. - Uncle. - Who are you referring to? Aren't you the great Uncle Joseph? He's saying great, I think he's a positive character. Yes, I'm Uncle Joseph. You're a very good man, Uncle. When I used to come to your home to play with Mary when we were kids, you used to serve me snacks. If you want, I'll serve some now as well. - No need, uncle. - Why? You were a good man. Why did you do that mistake? What do you mean? I can't remember that gesture. I forgot. Was it such a small mistake that you forgot? I'll keep slapping you until you recall what you did. - Do you remember it? - Yours was better. He slapped you after telling you the reason. He's beating me so that I can tell the reason. - Hey! - Oh, no! What are you discussing there without answering my question? No, I forgot the past after a coconut fell on my head. Could you please give me a clue? - Okay. Your daughter Mary and I... - Enough! You both fell in love, right? - Love? - Yes. - Love? - Yes. You said this to my best friend David and broke our friendship. - Who is David? - You are asking me who he is? Have you forgotten David, who loved your daughter Mary? Mr. Perfect, perfect He's Mr. Perfect Don't try to find a fault in him You can never find any defect This song is from which movie? - This song is from which movie? Tell me. - I don't know. If you don't know then what are you doing? Oh, cool gentle breeze Tell me, by touching my heart slowly - Where's the festival of spring? - Sir, this song is from the film Okkadu. - Is it? - Yes. Ask anyone if you have any doubts. Did I ask you now? Did I? Where did they go? - Close the door quickly. - Come. Thank God! He bashed us left and right. No matter who comes, don't open the door. My dear fellows! Why did you behave like that with them last night? What did I do? Don't you remember anything? I don't remember anything. What did I do? Then we must tell him. Good morning, Sundaram master. Doctor uncle! Aren't you Uncle Joseph? Oh, that's sad! Mr. Prasad must be feeling bad. I must apologize. Will they get up after how you thrashed them last night? - I will never have that juice again. - What was that? - Good morning, Sundaram master. - Good morning, Sundaram master. - That's what I said. - Yeah. - Uncle Joseph! - Uncle Joseph! Look how happy he is despite knowing that you don't love him. Venky, you are really great. Why so? Because you take everything positively. My blood group is also B-positive, so I got used to it. I'm really lucky... to know you. I like you. She said that she likes you. Your love story is another Titanic, Geethanjali, Dilwale. It's like Okkadu, Varsham. A truth flashed in your eyes How can I stay normal on earth now? My heart is on cloud nine like a kite I've opened my sealed lips For you My life is rushing And gushing towards you Today, the turmoil of dreams Has begun in both of us In a similar manner A truth flashed in your eyes How can I stay normal on earth now? My heart is on cloud nine like a kite What have you done to my heart? I gave it to you By saying that it belongs to you My eyes have been waiting for years To see this light I'm giving my hand to you You're my life partner Your call has given life To my desires and wishes My eyes that are looking somewhere Have lost their sleep And a change has begun A truth flashed in your eyes How can I stay normal on earth now? My heart is on cloud nine like a kite I knew my love will build up a bridge To your heart, my love You are mine And love is our army You won my world After seeing me in your heart I don't give a damn about heaven I'll leave myself to come towards you And give away my beauty to you Won't the seven wonders Of the world lose their sheen After seeing us together? A truth flashed in your eyes How can I stay normal on earth now? My heart is on cloud nine like a kite - He beat us black and blue last night. - Yes. Prasad, did he do it purposefully or unwittingly? Whatever it is, he made a big mistake. Let's keep him thinking that Pooja still loves him. Then we will break his heart. - What do you say? - You are right, bro! What are you saying? Your uncle still hasn't told Venky that you don't love him. Mr. Venky, I'm very sorry for what we've done to you. With the hope that you will understand... - Uncle! - What is it, dear? - Call Venky. - Why? Give this letter to him. They are not here, they went to Berlin to perform. I couldn't go because of my body ache. Don't do anything silly and give this letter to him after he returns. - I'm going to India. - Why? The eldest uncle called me. Grandpa isn't well. I mean, Johnson and the bank... Give this letter to Venky and apologize. I'll think about your money later. I'm on the job, boss. Tomorrow we'll hit Chengalrayudu. You be happy, bye. Are you planning to kill Chengalrayudu? Why? How can I live without killing someone? Recently, I took an advance from Guruva Reddy. Hey! I think more about my enemies than myself. Brother. I arranged the SIM card for Guruva Reddy who is in jail. Do you know the reason? To kill his henchmen. Brother, I'm begging you. Please leave me. How can the boss live if he leaves you? Brother! Brother! - Hello. - Brother, Pooja madam has arrived. What happened, Grandpa? You're here, dear! I didn't expect to see you. Grandpa! I wanted to see you marry your aunt's son before I die. - Promise me that you'll do so... - She'll marry him, Father-in-law. Brother, Uncle's acting was mind-blowing. Oh, no! You're not well. Why are you drinking instead of taking medicines? Why should I take medicines? I'm hale and hearty. I put up an act so that Pooja would agree to this marriage. Why act for it, sir? If not, will Pooja agree to marry this rogue with all the bad habits? But they say marriage within the family will affect the future generation. What do you say, Ramanujam? Yes, sir. Even your mother married within the family, right? If Pooja got married somewhere else, we'll be on the streets! Yes. The entire property belongs to her. If she marries Bhadram, the property will be ours. That's our plan. How much ever you may try, you can't escape from here. Recovery Officer Johnson's deadline is over. What shall we do if he comes now? Enjoy while you can. We'll cross the bridge when we get to it. - Then we must do it now. - Why? Here he comes! Why are you saying it so calmly? Damn it! Irresponsible scoundrels! Instead of paying me back, you are enjoying here. You can't cheat me! Where is my money? We'll pay you, sir. Give me two days. Hey, request him. Not just two days, but take a week's time. Otherwise, I'll put you in jail. - Hello. - Sister-in-law, it's me, Prasad. Prasad, how are you doing? All good. Please give the phone to Pooja. It's difficult to give the phone to her. Please do something and get her on the phone, it's very urgent. Pooja! Uncle Prasad is on the line. Uncle! Dear! My position is very precarious, Johnson is... I'm in a deeper problem here. I'm under house arrest. I don't know how but get me out of here. I'll solve all your bank problems. It's not that easy, my dear. They are extremely evil. Please, Uncle. Do something. Here, I'm... Especially my elder brother. Until he dies, nothing good can happen there. Hey, Prasad! That crook addresses me in the same manner. Hey! It's me! Brother, is that you? Are you okay? Stop with the drama and come here immediately. Pooja is getting engaged to Bhadrappa on the tenth. - The wedding is on the 15th. Got it? - Okay, Brother. I'll come with my wife and son. Bye, brother. I'll get angry if you try anything silly like this. It's very dangerous. Don't do it. What did Pooja say? She has promised to pay if we bring her here. Buy a ticket and bring her here. You think it's that easy to buy a ticket and come? It's your in-laws' place, right? You're right but they are crooks. - Sir. - Why did you come searching for us? I'm going back to India tomorrow. - Is it about your payment? - No, sir. For Pooja's sake. - Pooja has left for India. - Left? - She's getting married on the 15th. - What? Has Pooja agreed to this marriage? Why are you asking like a lawyer? They are forcing this alliance upon her, so what? So what? You know that I love Pooja. You are saying that she's being forced into this marriage. What do you mean by it? Doesn't it also mean that she loves me? What do you want me to do about it? You don't need to do anything. I'll look into it. I'll see how this wedding takes place. Irresponsible scoundrels! Where is my money? Get me out of here. I'll solve all your bank problems. Let's keep him thinking that Pooja still loves him. Then we will break his heart. If I use him to get Pooja here, my problem will be solved and I'll get my revenge. I knew you would take this risk, Venky. Pooja cried on the phone and told me to tell you to get her out of there. I thought about it. They are monsters. You're an innocent child. How should I send you there? Thorns on a flower are inevitable, danger will lurk over love. I'm ready to face any danger for my Pooja. RAJIV GANDHI INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT It's been an hour since Venky left to drop his luggage at home. He isn't back yet. He will come later. Let's go. The wedding is in our family. Don't talk about it when you don't know what the reality is! We are going there to stop the wedding, not to attend it. - What are you saying? - Listen. This is what has happened. Why isn't Pooja interested in this alliance? I'm the reason behind it. Pooja and I love each other. That's why this alliance is making her sad. She called Prasad and asked me to tag along. As her lover, it's my duty to help her escape. - I don't think of my duty as a burden. - It's okay. - You understood it, right? - Yes. Mummy, if you leak this matter by mistake, - they will send my dad to the cemetery. - Don't talk like that. Your dad is doing a good deed for the first time, why would I tell them? - Okay. You remember the plan, right? - Do you want me to repeat it? - No. - Then, let's go. - Inauspicious time will start soon. - Okay. - Let's go. - Take the luggage. Sir, Pooja's father was akin to God. He treated you and us as his own family members. Don't ruin his daughter's life. Instead of seeking forgiveness for your mistake, how dare you give me suggestions! Bairagi, let these be his last words. Let's go inside. - Farmers... - Good morning, Brother-in-law. You are up early! Don't get angry. Ramanujam and I worked all night and have done a good job which might make you happy. - Yes, sir. - What have you done? We have saved 20 lakh rupees from your tax. Really? You have done a good job. Brother-in-law, do you remember you promised me that if I did anything useful for you, you would return my property papers and send me back to my village? Yes, I remember. I will let you go. I'm very happy. Ramanujam, I'm going back to my village after 40 years. - Chinni. - Yes. Why haven't you mentioned anything about the orphanage? - Orphanage? - The one we established in Jogulamitta. - Really? I didn't know that. - Me too. Idiot! There are more than 1000 children over there. We feed them big idlis every morning. And for lunch and dinner, we serve them rice, curry, broth, pickle and curd. You're just like the male version of Mother Teresa. I do so much. Tell me the entire cost of it. It might cost you around two crore rupees. - What do you think, Ramanujam? - Yes, sir. Isn't it? Open an account of two crore rupees in the name of the orphanage. We will take all the money under a third party's name. What about the children at the orphanage? Shouldn't an orphanage exist for the children to be in it?! The orphanage doesn't exist?! You said there's an orphanage a while ago. It exists only on paper. Idiot! You have finished your PUC. Why don't you get the ideas that I get? In order to think like you, I need to have a cunning brain like yours. We got our sister married to you a long time ago. I came here with my sister and a calf. You tied the calf in the garden and tied me inside this house. The cow and my sister are long gone. But I'm still here. You took my property documents. You kept me as a bachelor all my life. From a teen, I have now turned old and still, I'm being held captive. You cannibal! You stingy man! You stinking, ugly man! - You beggar! - Sir! Why are you shouting at a soft man like me as if I'm that fat fellow?! It's a 40-year-old hell. I won't survive if I don't let out my anger. You have to take all this. Mr. Prasad, is that you? - Hey! Open the gate. - Yes. Come, we have to take the luggage. Welcome, madam. Venky! Thank you, Venky. Thanks for coming! I've come here to take you with me. Don't worry. - I will take you with me. - Hey! Leave me. Sorry, sir. I thought you were Pooja. What are you doing? Even the people who are very careful get killed here. Daydreamers like you will die in your dreams. - Got it? - Yes, I got it. What have you understood? I must listen to you if I want to live with Pooja. - To hell with you! Let's go. - Let's go. - Prasad, sir! - What? Why are they breaking these glass bottles? Are they being dried like fryums? - To wrap them in bombs. - Are bombs manufactured here? Don't shout. They might throw the bombs at you. Let's go. What are they cooking? sambar? - No, they're brewing arrack. - What? Yes! Country arrack. Can't you smell it? Yes, right. - Wait a second. - Now what? - Why is he sharpening a big knife? - Don't stare at him. He is very short-tempered. He cut his hand as it was disturbing him while sharpening the knife. Let's go. Mr. Prasad, do ordinary people even live here? Ordinary people don't live here. They will never be able to. Look there. He is Jammalamadugu Janardhan. - He has committed 50 murders. - Oh, God! Look there. That is Rajampet Ravi. He is a specialist in slashing throats. He drinks human blood. - Oh my God! - Have you understood? - Yes. - What have you understood? For Pooja to step into our home with her right leg in, I must enter this house with my left leg in. If something goes wrong, they will chop your legs off. If they ask you something, don't look at my face. Spontaneously, tell them anything that comes to your mind. - Watch how I deal with them in my style. - Follow me. Come. - We must find the rupee. - Greetings, Father-in-law and Brother. Why are our boys busy making bombs? If anyone tries to stop this marriage, they will throw these bombs at them. Well, who is he? He is Praneeth. - Greetings, sir! - Okay! He lives in Europe. You're a useless fellow in this house - and you have brought along another one. - No, Father-in-law! You should know that he is a multi-millionaire. He is here to open a factory. - He wants a local partner for that. - Yes! The investment will be done by him and management will be done by the partner. I told him that you're a trustworthy man. So, I brought him here to meet you. Why are you making him stand? - Come and sit, dear. - Go and sit. - Why have you brought a small bag? - The big bag is upstairs. That's who he respects. A rich man. What factory are you planning to set up here? Set up a urea factory on this dry land and lend it to farmers. - What do you say? - It's a good idea. Which place are you from? - Place? - Yes. Tadipatri. Tadipatri? Yes. Yes! Tadipatri is my native place, as well. Brother, his Tadipatri is different. It's in Telangana. - Am I right? - Yes. Even I meant the same one. That's my uncle's native place. I grew up there. Where is your house in Tadipatri? - House? - Yes! - There is a temple. - Yes. - Next to the temple. - It's Sharma's house. Well, next to Sharma's house. It's Ananda Rao's house. - So, you know Ananda Rao? - Yes! Then it's seven houses after Ananda Rao's house. After seven houses... There's a gap of seven houses between Uncle Ananda's house and my house. Just seven houses. Since you are addressing him as uncle, then you must be knowing Ananda Rao. Yes, I know him very well. We're family friends. If he knows that you have come here, he will be very happy. - Let me give him a call. - What? Not now, Brother. He is very tired. Yes, Uncle. Jet lag. It will only take a minute. Keep quiet. Just keep quiet. - Look at them, they look worried. - The number you're trying to reach - is not reachable. - The line is busy. We can talk to him later. You go and rest. You are right, Brother. We can talk later. - Go and get some rest. - Come, Praneeth. Bye, Grandpa. Bye, Brother. - What's your name, Uncle? - He will tell you later. Come, Praneeth. Ramanujam, there is something fishy about them. Even I feel the same. Are you saying that just to agree with me or do you feel the same, as well? Yes, I feel the same. Then keep an eye on them. - What is it? - Why did you say Tadipatri? How would I know that his relatives live there? Why did you address Ananda Rao as uncle? It would have been suspicious if I had said no! You have answers to all my questions. They have evidence for all your answers. You're shouting at me as if I've committed a big crime. - That was my idea. - Be it Idea or Airtel, if Ananda Rao's network gets connected, - we will be out of the coverage area. - Don't talk negatively. - Nothing will happen. - Take your hands off me. - Okay, I... - Come! Let's go. Why is Pooja looking at me like that? How else should she look at you? Her fiance has come after a long time. But there is no feeling or emotions on her face. She already has a lot of problems to worry about. How can you possibly see feelings on her face? Oh! You're right. Okay, let's go. - Where are you going? - To meet Pooja. - You're not allowed in there. - What? - I will bring her here. - Oh! - Dear, Pooja. - Uncle? I only asked you to come here. Why did you bring him? I'm not Lord Hanuman to take you away on my shoulders. But he knows some tricks. Moreover, he is in love with you. So, you haven't told him the truth yet. I was about to tell him. But you called me at the same time and told me about your problems. I was clueless. So, I brought him with me. How could you act so foolishly? I feel like I've made a grave mistake and you are continuing with it. The matter is still in our control. Instead of telling him the truth now, let's tell him after a few days. But if you get married to Bhadram, it will ruin your life. That's why I was forced to do this. But... No ifs or buts. Once you escape this place, I'll somehow try to convince them. Okay? - Okay. - That's not enough. You must be a little cozy with him. What? Do you want me to hug him? - Even he expects the same. - What? Nothing, dear, try to have fun with him. Come with me. Look at her. She has lost weight worrying about you. I know all this is an act. For me to arrive from Europe, for you to introduce me to Pooja. I know this is God's play. We are just the actors. All of this happened because we are made for each other. Problems will crop up. But we should never worry about them. I must to help you escape from here. Be happy. Smile, please. A little more. That's it. Good. Keep smiling. Prasad sir, let's go and rest. Prasad sir, did you notice? Pooja looked so pale. But after seeing me, she became very happy. Yes. But how? That's the magic of love. Love! I'm dreaming non-stop I'm lamenting non-stop I'm running wild with non-stop memories of her I'm dreaming non-stop I'm lamenting non-stop I'm running wild With non-stop memories of her I'm running non-stop I'm watching The non-stop lightening in me I'm going crazy non-stop When I'm with you You dipped my heart inside many colors Honey, it was like a festival of colors You shook my mini silent heart And brought little tremors to it I'm dreaming non-stop I'm lamenting non-stop I'm running wild With non-stop memories of her Let your breath Be my company round the clock And let it play The symphony of the lullaby Let me shower my touch On your heart all the time Allow and accept your partner Let the beauty approach me saying hello! Consider my gesture as yes And cradle my lips I'm dreaming non-stop I'm lamenting non-stop I'm running wild With non-stop memories of her My eyes are like The sunflower let it fill with dreams So dear, let your power burn my body Let my fingers play the tunes Of lust on your body And visit the city of love Let my shyness vanish without a trace Let the moon give its hand to me I'm dreaming non-stop I'm lamenting non-stop I'm running wild With non-stop memories of her I'm running non-stop I'm watching the non-stop lightening in me I'm going crazy non-stop When I'm with you - Sir, Ananda Rao is here. - Ananda Rao? Oh my God! Seventy-four. We're going to get thrown out and you're busy exercising here. What happened? - He has come. - Who? Your uncle, Ananda Rao. What should we do now? What else can we do now? Just jump over the wall & escape. Then, what about Pooja? - Come with Pooja from the back door. - Praneeth sir, our boss wants to meet you. He wants to meet you. Go. He also wants you to come. Even you. - I heard what he said. - Let's go. Let's go. Dear, Praneeth, he is... I know. He is Uncle Ananda Rao from Tadipatri. - Greetings, uncle. - Greetings. He is not Ananda Rao from Tadipatri. Surveyor Ananda Rao. I called him to hand over some land work related to the industries. Why were you in a hurry before he could introduce him to you? He is also tall & well-built like our Ananda Rao. Tall & well built? He is very lean. Can't you say anything right? Is he very lean now? I saw him when I was a child. I got a little confused. If I see him again now, I will never get confused. It's not a big deal. Let's talk to him on the phone right now. All your confusion will be resolved. Can't you say anything right?! Hello. It's me, Chengalrayudu. Hey Chengalrayudu, it's been too long since you called me. What is the news? A boy from Tadipatri went abroad and has come home very rich. Really? Who is that? You talk to him. Hello Ananda Rao, it's Praneeth speaking. How are you, uncle? I'm very fine... but whose son are you? We shouldn't discuss such matters on the phone. Why? Income tax officials might tap our phones. He is asking me about my income. How can I say it? - Don't tell him. - I won't. Do you want to know why I came here? Good. I will explain. Why is he answering questions which I haven't asked? You know my helping nature, don't you? I wanted to set up an industry here and help the poor. I need a partner for that. Oh, no! Why don't you become my partner? You don't need to invest a penny. What do you say? How could I refuse when you insist so much, Praneeth? We can proceed... - Don't tell him anything. - Hello, uncle? - Hello? - What's all this, dear? Since we have already discussed it, why do you still want him to be your partner? Since he is from my village... Bringing caste and village sentiments into a business will lead to your ruin. All you need is good people. Tell him! Yes, Praneeth. They are very good people. - Let's make them our partners. - Okay, Prasad. Since you insist, let's make them our partners. Sounds good. Take him and serve him porridge. - Go! It tastes good. - Come, Praneeth. I won't let it go. - Pick up the phone. - Hey, Chengalrayudu, when Praneeth was talking about his business, the call got disconnected. Give it to him. If you call again, I will cut your throat. Did you see how I prevented them from uttering Ananda Rao's name again? Great job. I hate this behavior. You never appreciate me when I do good things. If you make me tense again, I will die from a heart attack. Plan for a quick escape from this house. To plan that, I need this house plan. Why do you need this house plan, Venkataramana? - I will tell you once the job is over. - Venkataramana? - I'll clear your doubt right now. - Venkataramana? Prasad, I have a doubt... You are calling him Praneeth there, so why are you calling him Venkatramana here? - What's happening? - It's nothing. People have many nicknames. We refer to Mahesh Babu as Naani and Allu Arjun as Bunny. We call you Chinni. Nicknames exist for everyone. We refer to Mahesh Babu as Naani and not as Pavan Kalyan. We refer to Allu Arjun as Bunny and not as Prabhas. I'm not a fool to believe all that you say. You Lilliputian idiot. You are stupid. You stingy fellow. - You... - Sir! Why are you smiling when he is shouting at you? He is not shouting at me. He vents his anger on me, assuming I'm the one he's upset with, and shouts. Oh, I see. Only you have grown up and not your brain. You idiot. You stupid. Why are you laughing? - I'm scolding you and not Prasad. - Me? Did he ask you for all the details? Stop venting your anger on me. And tell your brother-in-law about Prasad. You will at least find some release. They won't trust me just like that. I need to prove it with evidence. - Hereafter, that is our part-time job. - Take your hands off. Are you angry with me for slapping you? Idiot! Venky! - I'm very lucky. - Why? When I first saw Pooja, she matched the looks of my dream girl. Now, even her qualities are matching with my expectations. It's all because of you. Why are you screaming? Someone might watch us. Let's go. - Awesome! - Come. - Didn't you cook any meat? - No. No non-vegetarian dishes today, as we have offered prayers to God. Should I starve because of your prayers? Son, if you don't eat non-vegetarian food for one day... I won't eat. You eat. Damn! Why is Bhadra so angry? He is angry because I didn't cook non-veg food. But is this how one should treat their mother? He can't be blamed. All men in this house are the same. Today is an auspicious day. Every woman wants to pray to God and share a meal with her husband. But they don't understand anything. Look, she's so worried. How could he shout at his mother? Idiot. Forget about that idiot. Do you know what Shahrukh Khan does in such situations? What does he do? He takes advantage of this situation and eats with the heroine. - He is Shahrukh. - What will Venky do? Watch me. - I'm very hungry. - Even I'm very hungry. Don't worry. Sathi has gone to a military hotel. He will get something to eat. Oh, God! Hello Uncle Ananda Rao, it's me Praneeth speaking. I spoke to you about the industry, didn't I? I want to discuss it right now. I'm a little tense to make them my partners. His son threw the plate on the floor in frustration for not having non-veg dishes. Where there is no sentiment, there will be no success. So, be ready for our partnership. I will call you. No doubt. I'm telling you. Ninety percent partnership for you. Ramanujam, look at him with his grandson. He is overhearing his conversation on the phone. Manner less fellow. Keep in touch. Bye. Damn! You glutton! You have ruined everything. Will you die if you don't eat for one day? Stop shouting at me and focus on doing what needs to be done. - Please take these sweets. - I'll eat everything today. Serve me all of them. Eat well. Don't feel shy. Eat. It tastes good. Eat it. Sister-in-law, pass me that sweet. Grandfather, eat this. He is coming. Why are you serving us? Sit and eat with us. It is getting late. - We will eat later, Father-in-law. - Grandfather! When did you come? Do you also offer prayers on auspicious days? Not just this day. On the Bhogi festival, we decorate our homes with colors. We celebrate the women's festivals as well. Forgive me for asking for non-veg food on such an auspicious day. It's alright. Have the food. Eat it. Have some more. What's this grandfather? Why are feeding the photo? It's not a mere photo. After feeding my late wife, I then have my meal. Since you are from abroad, our sentiments, love, and affection might seem funny to you. No, not at all. Given your absence of sentiment, I contacted Ananda Rao for a partnership. You should stop calling him. If you have anything to say, tell us. We will do as you say. - Come eat with us. - Eat. It's alright. I will eat later. See how I made them kneel to their knees? - Thank you. - No formalities between us. Isn't your family mine, and isn't my family yours? - Look. - What is this? Couples are eating together. We are going to be a couple. Let's also eat together. That is... Your aunt said it's good for us. - Pooja! - He always drops in at the wrong time. Cheers also mean eating together. Eat it. Why is Venky after you with a food plate like flies on sugar? No, uncle, his hopes in me are growing stronger with each passing day. I don't know how to tell him the truth. Be patient for a few days. Once our job is done, we can get rid of him. Sir, these accounts... You made the mistakes, so why chide him? Let bygones be bygones. Be patient. Everything will be fine. Get rid of him after the job is done. What's the job? First, let's do our job. Let me through. Kiss me. - What's this, silly? Move! - Silly? Am I not your fiance? - Leave my hand. - Why can't you kiss me? - Leave my hand. - Give me a kiss. Bhadrappa! - Hey, Bhadrappa! - Leave me. Bloody old man! Crook! - Arrogant fellow. - You don't feel bad, Pooja. My blood was boiling seeing him behave like a beast. But I controlled it. Be patient for a few days. I will get rid of him. Prasad wants to get rid of him. He wants to get rid of Bhadrappa, What do you understand from it? Nobody is using their right leg. My foot! It's not that. Something is going wrong. It's fishy. If I get a small clue, I'll have a ball. - I got it! - Come and sit here. We'll dance to his tunes till the factory work is over. What do you say? - As you say, uncle. - That's it. What is this new trend of women serving food and wearing new outfits? I heard Praneeth on the phone threatening to cancel the partnership. - From this phone. - Yes I mean it. - Can I share some shocking news? - What is it? This phone has been dead for two days. - Did I not send in a complaint, Ramanujam? - Yes, sir. He called from a dead phone, and you believed him. He's making you all fools along with Venky. - Uncle! What are you saying? - Truth! If you have a doubt, check it. Likewise, give my property papers and throw me out of here. Check it up! - What do you say, Ramanujam? - As you say, sir. Hello! I'm Tadipatri Ananda Rao. Can you please call Praneeth on the phone? Okay, sir. Please stay on the line. I'll call him. - It's Ananda Rao. - Ananda Rao? - Yes! - Give it to me. Stay calm. I will speak to him tactfully and gather information. Look at them. Is he acting his age? Hello! This is Praneeth. Tell me, uncle. I heard a bulldozer rolling in. I came running quickly. Perhaps you heard the sound. But your voice doesn't sound like Praneeth. I changed my voice! Changed your voice? That is... Uncle, my voice changed while discussing the factory with different people. Why have you called me now, Uncle? I'll tell you but those idiots are not near you, right? Which idiots, Uncle? Chengalrayudu and his uncle. It's a sin to call elderly men idiot, Uncle. Sin? Seeing their face is a sin. You may not know it, but Chengalrayudu is a murderer. His uncle is a sinner. He usurps other people's property. People who did business with them are on the streets now. If you come quickly, we can proceed ourselves. - Hey, Ananda Rao! - What happened, Praneeth? I'm not Praneeth, I'm Chengalrayudu's uncle. You didn't recognize me, right? If you call Praneeth again or try to meet him, I'll break your limbs, mind it. Hang up the phone. - Thank God! - Hey! It wasn't working when I complained. Trying to wedge differences between the partners. I'll skin you alive! Bloody lousy man! - Ramanujam? - Sir! Why does it always have to be me? That's what even I don't get it. Hello! In response to your complaint, your telephone line was rectified an hour ago. It's my bad fate or else how can the phone get repaired on time. Let's check the accounts. Did you know that the phone was working? Why didn't you tell them? I wanted to see your worried face. You're a sadist, as well. I can't hold on to this tension. - Tell me about our plan. - I'll show you. Wait. - Do you know what is this? - Arundhati Palace. No, the palace we are staying at right now. Can't you see the bulls? Vishwanath Sathyanarayana said to think theoretically and work practically. I have 62 percent clarity according to this plan, when I gain clarity on the rest our paperwork will be over and we can escape. When will you gain clarity on the remaining 38 percent? How can I tell? This is a creative job. It can happen just like that or it can take time. By then they may even kill us. No need for paper or plan, we must escape tonight. I'll tell you a plan and you follow it. That's all. No, there's a small problem here... That's all. What's this, sir? - Kerala oil. - Can we use it here? You don't work but you pass comments. Try to hold me. Oh, God! We can slide through if anyone tries to catch us. Only thieves get such ideas. Okay, let's go, give me your slippers. They are mine, they'll be big for you. I don't want to wear them, they'll make a sound and wake people up. Be careful. Take it slow. - Who's that? - I'll manage. All useless cats are here. - I'll do it again. - No. He'll sleep if I do it again. Bloody... Keep quiet. Bloody cat is dead! Hey, stop right there! Why are you rushing as if you know the place? Follow me. Who is disturbing me at this hour? No! Why are you calling at midnight? I'm getting bad dreams about you. Sleepwalking and getting beaten up with utensils and mugs. Don't encourage bad dreams. Ramanujam! - What's it, sir? - Get up. - Why are you disturbing my sleep? - Look there. - Cut the call. - Is that Swaroop? - I'll talk to him. - No need. Did you see their true colors? - We must catch them red-handed. Come. - Okay. Come here. Silence! I got him! - Why are you waking him, up? - Wait. - Ramanujam, listen carefully. - Tell me, sir. I must steal my property documents and escape from here tonight. Okay, come. Where did they go? When did you come? Do you know what's going on here? - I heard everything. - What did you hear? Your plan! I heard everything. - Sir, why are you hitting me? - What's my fault? Go! Spend the night in this storeroom. Enough with the chuckling. Come. Oh, no! Stop, look there. Bairagi is here. He releases dogs every night at this time. - There's no danger with big dogs. - Then? They might look ferocious but they are soft. But the small one looks very simple yet very cunning. - It has a special feature too. - What is it? - It spares the person he likes. - If not? It'll bite. They say barking dogs seldom bite, but this biting dog never barks. - He released them. Oh god! - Yes! Oh, God! You go that side, I'll go this side. - Oh god! - Oh no! Oh! Oh no! Is it? It is looking at whichever side I turn? No! Oh God! I'll teach you a lesson. Let me see how you can come out. Where is Prasad? Oh god! No! Let go of me! Prasad sir! Prasad sir! Prasad sir! - Come! - You come! How can I come out? It must let me go. You wait, I'm coming. Come soon, it's killing me. Leave me. Don't get scared, if I put on this monkey cap, it can't see and will be confused. You go out first. That's it! It'll stay here only. Pooja! pooja! Why are you pulling me? It's not Pooja. She changes rooms every night. - Whose room is this? - Chengalrayudu. Who is it? Bloody ringtone. Switch it off. Hey! Who is it? Bommali... I'll won't spare you. - Him? - Bommali! He disturbed my sleep. Get up... - Pooja darling! - You, get up! - What's it, father? - Sleep in your grandpa's room. Grandfather snores a lot, I can't sleep there. Your laments are disturbing my sleep. Why are you kicking me? - Get out quietly. - I'll go. Why are you beating me? Am I not going? Am I beating you? Are you drunk? Go! - Never lets me sleep peacefully. - Bloody idiot! - Why did you beat him? - Not beat, I must thrash him. How dare he hold Pooja's hands. Forget him. first, let's find, where is Pooja? You go that side, I'll go this side. Pooja! This short man doesn't know to keep the phone in silent mode. If it rings again, he'll get caught. It's better to warn him. Pooja! Somebody is here. Prasad sir, where are you? Oh my god! Oh no! - Why are you hanging there? - Don't just watch, pull me up. - Give me your hand. - Pull me up. That hand too! Be careful! Oh no, Prasad, sir! Stay right there, I'm coming. Why did you fall into the dung heap? You're stinking! Get up! Don't know what sin you committed to get punished like this. How come a godly man like you got punished. Let's go, sir. I'm going forward but why are you going backwards? - What? - Look there! Glass pieces! I didn't see it. Looks like you're hurt severely. Come here. Sit here. You were helping me, why are you getting hurt, sir? Are you crying for me? Why do you suspect me? I always feel like crying when I see you. My throat is dry crying for you. I think this is water. Why is it hot? - How do I know? Drink. - Okay, I'll drink. Come, let's enter the house. Come on I say. Why is he spinning his head? - Good morning, Sundaram Master. - What? Why did you walk on glass pieces like kids? My fate! You go. - You'll know when they amputate it. - How come your face is hurt? Why are you asking as if you don't know anything? I don't how you go hurt. I forgot everything after I had warm water. Not warm water but local brew. Oh! So I saw all the three in you and had thrashed you... You've sacrificed so much for me and united me with my love Pooja, but I beat you black and blue. Why are you shouting so loudly to wake everyone up at home? - If anyone hears we'll be in danger. - Sir! What's it? What is all this about your love and Prasad helping you? No mother, actually what had happened was... You wait, how can a girl say these things? I'll tell you. Unlike what you may believe, I'm not Praneeth. Chiitapadhula Venkata Ramana. Father is Late Chittapathula Ramachandraiah. Mother is Late Chittapathula Janaki Devi. We are from the beautiful city of Hyderabad. We belong to a colony where everyone is close like a relative. Venkataramana, when will you finish if you go so slow? I'll finish it in three sentences. This is not a crime story to be told in a few sentences, this is a love story, without details you can't understand it, - where did I stop? - You said something about some colony. Not some colony but Ananda Nagar colony. Just like its name, we lived very happily there. One day in those times... Get up Prasad, it's over. This is what happened. - I skipped parts due to time constraints. - Skipped? - I could've narrated the Mahabharata. - Okay. You understood the past, right? Now, let's talk about the future. Did you all see the film Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge? If they hadn't, will you narrate its story to them now? No, like the film's hero, Shahrukh Khan, I'll get permission from everyone without hurting them, my ambition is to marry Pooja then. But the men in this house are idiots, Prasad said we can't reform them, without any other way, we planned this escape. - What do you say, Prasad? - That's it. That's it. I'm very happy for Pooja getting such a good man like you. My niece is more than a daughter to me. Her happiness is more important to us But marriage arrangements are in full swing, now? I'll manage it, but I need your co-operation. Mainly from you, Pooja. Nothing, they will tighten the security if you show displeasure. But if you behave, you like the marriage, They will relax and we can escape. - What do you say, Prasad? - That's it. That's it! - What are these 10,000 rupees for? - A payment. You ask as if I took it! Keep your accounts away for some time. Tomorrow morning is the marriage. The Bride is weeping there. The Groom is sitting here with a sullen face. - If it had been Ananda Rao's house... - Why do you compare everything to him? It's not that, Uncle. It's bad luck for us if the house isn't festive at such a time. I fear it may get to me as well as I'm your partner. It won't happen. Tell us, what should we do now? - We must rock it! - That's all, right? We'll follow whatever you say. What's this song? Even good workers will feel sleepy. What do you say, Grandpa? Stop your lousy old songs, it'll go from bad to worse for us. - You sing! - May I? - Come on. - Okay, get ready. Ding, dong! Ding, dong! Ding, ding, ding dong Sing, song. Sing, song Sing, sing, sing song Ding, dong! Ding, dong! Ding, ding, ding dong Sing, song.

Ding, ding, ding dong Sing, song. Sing, song Sing, sing, sing song Everybody Lord, please forgive me for hurting Venky with or without my knowledge. What were you praying about? I've decided to tell the truth to Venky, Uncle. Will he cooperate with us after he knows the truth? I don't know how he'll react to it. We made a mistake and we must be ready to face the outcome. True! God-fearing people like you fear sinning. Swear on God you won't tell this to Venky. Damn it! I don't mind what you say, but if Venky comes to know about this, he'll tell those idiots about our plan to escape. They will lock you here and pack me in a coffin. That's why I put you under oath. Please forgive me. Boss, Guruva Reddy is out of jail. It's not safe for you to go out. If you are scared, never start it, once you start it, never be scared of it. Why did Guruva Reddy go to jail? What's that deadly look? Oh, God! Boss! Think again, Chengalrayudu is a very dangerous man. If he's a dangerous man, am I useless? I was born to kill him. Look, he'll go to Kurnool by this route tomorrow, let's plant a landmine near Chittigirdh culvert, when his convoy reaches the culvert, the landmine will blow up. Be alert! His men are coming, run! Hello! Sir, Guruva Reddy has attacked Chengalrayudu with his men, a big fight is going on. - Chitappa! - Sir! It seems Guruva Reddy has attacked my nephews. Go immediately. Hack all of them! You weren't born to kill me. You were born to die at my hands. No, don't kill me, Chengalrayudu. No. Chengalrayudu, here me out. What happened, Uncle? Sir, Guruva Reddy has attacked Chengalrayudu with his men. - Tie, him! Tie, him. - Leave me. Bairagi, they must not cross our boundary at any cost. What do you think, sir? A plan must be airtight, just like this. Even you had a foolish plan. See, no chases, no deaths. Everything is peaceful. Oh! - Look behind. - We mustn't see behind while driving. Get over your silly rules and look back. What is it? I am in this mess for trusting a fool like you. If we are caught, I'll be the first to die, drive faster. Never panic when facing a problem, Prasad sir. Wear your seat belt, even you, Pooja. - Go fast! - You don't get tensed up. Go! Why are you entering the forest? We can't hide on the highway, here we may have a chance. Drive carefully! I'm almost dying. - You'll lose balance if you move. - Okay. Oh my god! Oh no! No! No! We may get caught if we hit the road, go right. Once we take a right turn, taking a right again is geographically wrong. - Do as I say. - That's not... That's all. Okay. What are you fed upon? Food or grass? It's unlucky to follow your lead. - Go, man! - Go! - Why are you entering this village? - Shut up! You need the details? - Hey, you go that side. - Turn the vehicles. Did you get it now? That's CVR. Stop the vehicle! What are they doing here without following the others? Come... come... Oh my god! Where are you heading, Venkataramana? - I'll tell you, wait. - After my death? Shut up for a while Come, let's eat something. I'm not hungry, uncle. You carry on. Let's get a parcel, she'll eat later. Why isn't he coming to our table? You can't withstand hunger, Prasad. Who is calling you at this hour? It's Bhadrappa. - Don't answer it. - We'll pass the time till food comes. - Passing time with him? - Hello! Where are you? Is there any question more silly than this? Will we tell our whereabouts? You've done a big mistake by taking away Pooja. No need for the usual dialogues, say something new. Hand over Pooja to us, and we'll pay any price. I asked for new and you're repeating the same old hash. Venky, not for sale. What do you say, Prasad? Why did you take away Pooja? Brainless fellow! Why would anyone take her? I love her, so I'm taking her. I'm giving you a last chance, if you ask the same question, I'll hang up. Think of something new! Pooja doesn't love you, she loves someone in Europe. I told you to say something new but you're telling lies. This is not a lie but the truth. That Uncle Prasad is a cheater. He's using you. Hey, Prasad! While Pooja loves someone else, will you use me by making me believe that she loves me? - No... - What's it then? - Today I'll drink your blood. - Drink it. Bhadrappa tried to kill you till now, unable to accomplish the same, he's lying about me, and by trusting him, you are ready to kill me, I went out of the way to take so much risk for your love, I did get the stick I deserved. - Wasn't he telling me the truth? - Still, having doubts? It's fine as you asked me this. If you had asked Pooja, she would think, "He suspects me so much before marriage, how much will he suspect me after marriage?" That's how she would react and spit on your face. I believed that rogue and hit you. I'll tell Pooja all the accusations you heaped on me. Don't do it, everything will get spoiled. - It was a slip of the tongue. - Okay. - Please, sir. Please. - No! No! Okay. I'm sparing you because I'm a good man. - Never again do like this. - Never. - Sir! - Even the food is ready, have it. Tell me, Ajay. Pooja, I'm waiting at the airport. Are you safe? Yes, I'm safe. Okay, the flight is at 4 o'clock. Come quickly. Okay. - Pooja, I love you. - I love you too. - You can bring the parcel. - Wait, let's go together. - Just do as I say. - Okay. - Please don't say anything to Pooja. - I will not. Uncle! Where is Venky? He met some friends and went with them. He promised to meet us in Hyderabad. Trouble starting the car, sir? What? Damn! Get down. Sit on that side. If you face any problem, think of God. Hail Venkatesa! Did you see it? That's the power of God. - Venkatramana, go to the airport. - Why to the airport? A friend of Pooja is coming from Europe, to receive him. Is he here to attend our marriage? Yes to attend your marriage, go. Okay. - Pooja, are you okay? - I'm okay. - Hello? - Who is he? My name is Venkatramana, aka Venky. My profession is ventriloquism, my favorite place is Tirupathi, - my favorite dish is... - Who the hell are you? - Pooja's fiance! - What? - Why is he shocked? - Thank God, he's not dead. We didn't tell him about your love story to surprise him. - Their love story? - Why is he shocked again? You stop giving him shocks, and you come with me, I'll tell you. Where are you going? You can tell him here itself. Moreover, I want to hear about my love story from you. It'll not be nice to tell your love story in front of you. - Yes, you are right. - You come with me. - Is he your close friend? - Yes. Then, he'll enjoy our love story a lot. - That's what happened. - Oh! Keeping him trapped, I used him till now. - That's all, isn't it? - That's all. Let's go there and send him out under some pretext, before he comes back, let's escape. Okay? - Okay! - Come on. They are coming back. - Did you hear the full story? - I did. - How is it? - Fine. Just fine? It must be shattering. Ours is a new love story. He has traveled a long way, has jet lag, he has a headache. Get him a Saridon. Why should I get it? Anyway, we are going to my house. We can buy it on the way. No, it'll take time to get his luggage, go and get it till then. - Yes. - Okay! I suspect your uncle wouldn't have told him correctly, so you please tell him as well. Pooja, let's move. Let's wait until he goes. He starts the car and we escape. - Okay! - Venky! What? I'm sorry. Why say sorry for it? Isn't your friend my friend? Stay with him, I'll be back in a minute. - Thank God! - It's time for our flight. Come. Come, Pooja. That's my problem, please tell Pooja about the money. Okay! - Come, Pooja! - Who are you? Ajay! Bhadrappa, what's this rogue-like behavior? Boys, throw him also into the vehicle. Ajay! Hey! You! Stop the car! Hack him! Oh my God! You said they were using me, right? Not a soul has come into this world to use me or play with me. I love Pooja and I'll marry her. Get it into your mind. I don't know whether I'll hack or kill, if anyone comes between us. - Come, Pooja. - Venky! Come! What are you saying? It's wrong information... that Pooja loves someone in Europe, Father. Pooja loves none other than Venky. Getting late for our flight, where is he taking us? Find out. - Where are you taking us? - Shut up! Why are you in a hurry? I'll tell you. Bloody idiots. How dare they want to separate Pooja and me. If anyone dares to come between us, I'll cut them. Venky, cool. Take it easy. - Steering! - You keep quiet man! Relax! ANAND NAGAR COLONY Till now you saw my violent angle, now you'll see my family angle. Come. - The girl is beautiful. - Wow! Perfect! Made for each other! They are made for each other. She was born to be with our Venky. Venky is very innocent. You must take the first initiative. What's all this? Venky! - Take our daughter-in-law to Taj Mahal. - As you say. Come. Come, my dear. Come. Why are you following them? Don't disturb them. Mysamma, arrange for their stay in our godown. What? Please put your right leg first and walk in. Come, dear. - She's feeling shy. - Come in, dear. He wanted to enter this house with his wife. That's the reason he stayed at his aunt's house till now. Venky, show the house to your wife. Pooja, when you entered the house I felt like I won the world. These are Lord Venkateshwara's blessings. He united us as I wished. They are my parents. They will be happy now wherever they may be. Mother used to tell me, look after your wife like a queen. That's why I readied everything for her. What's it? What happened, Pooja? Missing your parents? Just a minute. - How are you, my dear Pooja? - I'm well mother. Don't worry, dear. We trust Venky, he will take good care of you. Pooja, don't call us again. If necessary, we'll call you. - It's dangerous if anyone overhears us. - Okay. Do you feel better now? You're more sensitive than me, I sometimes lie and repent for it, you never tell a lie or hurt anyone. It's very difficult to survive with this attitude. What's this Prasad? We are having tea here like losers. I think they will marry them as I stand watching. What to do, brother. The situation is like that. Look at her, isn't she like a pigeon munching on a pan? Let's tell her about our predicament and go with Pooja. - 50 liters of milk to the hotel. - Write it in those accounts. Greetings, Sister. - Greetings. - We want to discuss an important issue. - Okay, you go ahead. - Sister! What's your problem? I'm talking to these gentlemen. - Sister, that Shankar... - Wait up. - Got him? - Yes, Sister. Bring him here. Hey Shankar, how long will you roam avoiding me? You cheat! - No, Sister... - Bloody hell! I'll kill you, bloody! I'll hack you. Your sister and you sent my boy to the hospital. Played love drama and roamed around, with a promise to marry. How dare you fix her marriage with a rich boy? Bloody hell! Please, Sister, don't beat me. I'll fix my sister's marriage with your boy, sister. Go, you bloody loser! Tell me, Brother. You wanted to tell me something. Nothing, Sister, I want to present a silk saree to you for Venky's marriage. Why should you present us with a saree for Venky's marriage? - We'll present you with a silk dhoti. - Okay, sister. - Don't do that. Please open the door. - Don't do that. Please open the door. No, Uncle! Please listen to me, Uncle. Why should I live now? Last night my son appeared in my dream saying, "I brought people home who should be rotting on the streets, how could they send my daughter to the streets?" He was asking this to my face. I played to your tunes all these days, I lied that I'm going to die and brought my granddaughter home, I deserve death for the sins I committed along with you. - Father... - Uncle, listen to me. Let's arrange Pooja's marriage with the man she loves. How can you do it? Who knows where is she? How is she now? Father-in-law, we know where is Pooja. Let's go to Tirupathi immediately after the marriage. Uncle and Aunty, I've good news for you. Pooja's mother called me just now, and the entire family has accepted me. They've asked us to go there immediately. Agreed for their marriage? - What's this sudden twist? - What's it? How would they not accept you? How can they let go of a golden boy like you? - I'm nothing, the credit goes to him. - Who is that? It's him! Hail Venkatesa! Hail Venkatesa! Come on! Come on! Come on! everybody say Hail Venkatesa! Hail Venkatesa! Hail Venkatesa! Hail Venkatesa! Dear, Lord Balaji of seven hills How powerful you are your blessings Hail Venkatesa! Hail Venkatesa! My fate changed because of you And turned us into Made for each other couple Hail Venkatesa! Hail Venkatesa!

Hail Venkatesa! 1000 copies of my wedding Invitation cards are printed We sent you the first copy of it Come out of the temple To attend our marriage, Oh Lord We prepared the VIP guest list And you top that list The marriage band doesn't Work in your absence, oh lord We fixed marriage on Saturday The day that's special to you We booked 100 kg of Tirupathi laddoo To serve in marriage feast We arranged an orchestra with Annamayya devotional songs Hail Venkatesa!

Hail Venkatesa! Hail Venkatesa! Hail Venkatesa! You're a big man, what changed that you wanted to kill yourself, Uncle? You wanted to die by self-immolating with petrol. What a change, brother-in-law! Hey Bairagi! As soon as Pooja comes, take her inside. And kill Venky immediately. He fooled us, how can our anger subside if he kills him, Uncle? I'll kill him with my hands. You promised to get them married, what's this twist? Fool! I heard the women of the house talking to her on phone. I thought of a ruse to bring her here. Thought of a ruse? Why didn't you try for the Nandi Award as well? Bloody crook! Bad time would've vanished, if I'd thrown a lighted match stick on you doused in petrol. - Bloody crook, rogue... - Brother-in-law... - Brother-in-law? Where is he? - Just for fun. - What is this? - Just for fun. - Why? - Just for fun. Comedy in your dirty life too? Bloody idiot! Come, let's check accounts. His boss disparages him and he disparages me. Why don't you get down? Get down quickly! Get off the bus. - Did you see it? - Yes. - Venkanna's in-laws' house is like a fort. - Yes, it's amazing. - It's like Golconda fort. - Come in. Why are they here, Venkataramana? How can I marry without them? I invited them all. Please, come in. As per your wish, you are marrying Pooja with everyone's consent. -Bhadrappa, -Yes - for their stay, ready the guest house. - Okay. Come in. Come in, dear. You take rest. Come, Pooja. You said you'll tell him upon arrival. Why didn't you tell him? They came all of a sudden. I'll tell them at the right moment. Wait till then. I think everything will be over in this waiting period. Trust me. Go and freshen up. Go. Uncle, Brother, Wow! Everyone is here. I'm very happy about your reformation and agreeing to this marriage. But I must tell you an important matter about the groom. We too are waiting to tell you about an important matter. Why did you close the door, Uncle? Is it a secret? Yes, it is a secret. Come... How dare you fool us along with Venky! - Haven't you reformed? - No way. I'm sparing you because you're my son-in-law. I'll chop Venky up and get Pooja married to Bhadrappa as planned. It's not as easy as thrashing me, Uncle. People who came with him are beasts like you. Bairagi, call Allagadda Narasimhulu and tell him to send all his men. What's happening? Sir, did you tell him the truth? No, they told me a new truth. Why do you always narrate new tales? You can't do it, I'll tell him myself. If you are so determined, go ahead. - Give me your address before you go. - Why? Shouldn't I intimate about your death to your people? What are you saying? - They didn't invite us for a wedding. - Then? To kill us. You understood your family members' intentions, right? We must flee right now. What about Venky? Venky? You fooled him in the name of love for fun. Your uncle stretched it to this extent. If not today, he'll know the truth in the future. Then, both of you would be strangers. I am sorry, Venky. I am sorry. I made a big mistake. I've committed a grave sin by playing with a good man like you. I'm going through hell for it every day. I am sorry, Venky. I am sorry. Pooja, please. Pooja, please. Why do you think it is just your mistake? I too am part of it. I used to cross-check my program several times fearing adverse public reaction. But I didn't do that in the matter of choosing a life partner. It's not wrong to think of taking care of a wife like a queen. But I couldn't realize it was wrong to wish for a queen as a wife. That's how my life is. Somebody arranges the program and somebody delivers speeches. They invite people like me to ensure the audience does not get bored. Hearing the applause I thought it was all for me. Later on, I realized, I am a joker. Just a joker. Sorry, Venky. It's okay, Ajay. One must be lucky to get anything. You are lucky. Miss Pooja, I always wished you happiness. I still wish you the same, It's my responsibility to safely take both of you out of here. Ajay, trust me. Venky... Aren't you angry with me? I am just a little sad. My people are happily waiting there. How am I going to break this news? No problem. I'll manage them. - The color of this saree is good. Superb! - Good one. Look at this chain. It's round. - Hey, what's with your gulping? - Let go of me. - Hey! - What happened to him? If you drink undiluted, you'll die. What if I die? Who will be at a loss? Oh, dear! What's with these words right before your wedding tomorrow morning? Marriage... Marriage... Would I die if I don't marry? - This marriage will not happen. - Why not? Pooja loves Ajay, not me. Why did she bring you here citing being in love with you? Did she tell you that she loves me? Did she, at least, tell me? Believing some fool's words, I brought the situation to this stage. It was my mistake. I thought of keeping her in my heart, uncle. But she fell on my feet to forgive her. I promised to take them out safely from here. You promised to help the girl who ditched you? It wasn't her fault. The astrologer already said to me, that I'll remain as a lone shell. That's what happened. I am not a match to her stature, Uncle. Nobody must fall in love, Uncle. If it fails, it puts them in terrible pain. Pooja shouldn't feel that pain. That's why, we must help them to escape from here. I made a plan for it as well. Mad Venkanna! You wish good for the people who have hurt you. It's her bad luck to miss a gentleman like you. She's a good girl. It was all Prasad's doing. Venky! - A shocking news to you. - What is it, sir? They called you here to kill you, but not to get you married. "Somehow get me married to Venky, and take us away from here," said Pooja. So, you plan something and help me, Ajay, and Pooja, to escape from here. Hurry up! I'm an old man. I don't care about dying, Think about Pooja's life if anything happens to you. What will happen? Why do you ask silly questions? She'll die without you. Will she die? I had boozed to forget everything. And it is not getting imbibed because of your blow. Has Pooja become a fan of mine after hearing my song? How easily you cheated me with your words? Will my life turn if Pooja is by my side? Turn! What was that? Getting frustrated, falling into depression, would I get ruined? Would I get ruined? Would I get ruined? - Venkanna, stop. - Thanks, Sister. I'll take care of him. Thanks, Venky. Thanks for everything. It's okay, Ajay. We must get away from here before they get to know the truth. Murthy is at the airport with the tickets. Will you call back after reaching there, won't you? Of course, Venky. She is leaving, she is leaving Silence is my only solitude Silence is my only solitude -Venky -Stay here. Hey, Venky! I wanted to chop you into pieces for cheating us. After knowing the truth, I liked your character. So I'm giving you a chance. Leave them and walk away. You gave me a chance, but I made a promise to them. You will die. I thought my life was with Pooja. Now, I'm ready to die for Pooja. Hack him, boys! It's me, Brother-in-law! Did you see your partner's true colors? You said I was creating a rift between partners when I told you about him. Now, he's breaking your back. Isn't it, Ramanujam? Right, sir. Hey! Brother-in-law, all your men are down. You're next. He'll make you run and beat you to a pulp. - Right, Ramanujam? - Yes, sir. If anything happens to you, what about my property papers? Please tell me where they are! What if I don't tell you? Yes, Ramanujam? Bloody idiot! Venky, don't hurt my uncle! Venky! Why did you spare the man who raised a sword at you? He was fighting with us for our daughter's happiness. There are several Gods in the temple. But I rejected all of them, and made you my favorite God. I took your name, used your style of the application of vermilion, and trusted you. What have you done in return? You got all my friends married. Now you're getting my lover married to someone else. Are you happy now? I have had enough of you. We are parting for good. Bye. Are you from the bride's side or the groom's? - Why? - Why are you asking silly questions? The wedding canopy is empty. Fill it up. Why? To take everything after the wedding? - Are you married? - No. - You'll never get married in this life. - I know. Say something new. Innocent Venkanna, I feel sad about your situation. It's good for your health to be sad. Venky, you are monitoring our Pooja's wedding. You have such a good heart. You won't become an outsider even after Pooja's wedding. You're always welcome in our home. Happy to hear that. The wedding time will start soon. Let's go. - Hey, Venkatarmana. - You, as well. Bring the bride and the groom. Sit down. You also sit down. - Sit! - Venky, you sit there. Why him? I'm not the groom. It's Venky. Why aren't you ready yet, Pooja? - I want to talk to you, Ajay. - What? I thought the burden on my heart will vanish if I tell the truth to Venky. But now, I'm feeling sad about losing Venky, rather than feeling happy about getting married to you. Everyone can fall in love, but only a few can share the love. One such man is Venky. He was ready to die for me. Ajay, I've taken a decision and I hope that you will understand me. Venky, you won Pooja's heart with your good heart. I have learned a lesson from you. Always be positive. Sit down, the auspicious time will begin soon. Just a minute. All of you, stay here. Oh, Lord Venkatesa! I lost my senses and chided you. I will never sin like this again! Thank you, God. Thank you. - Hail Venkatesa! - Venky. Have you thanked your boss? - Me... My boss... - What will you tell me then? - What can I... What can I tell you? - I love you. - I love you, Venky. - Pooja! Superb! Dear Pooja, I'm very happy that you got married. If you give me Johnson's dues, I'll go back to Europe. It's not up to me. I'm married now, Uncle. It's all in his hands now.
