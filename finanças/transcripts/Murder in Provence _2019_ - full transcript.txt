- Fabian ? Fabian ? A ring. Fabian ? A police siren. Fabian ! - Police ! Hands in the air ! Police. Hands up ! - Turn around ! * -Marie Jourdan. Leave a message. - You have to come, I'm going to need you. - Honey, I know the kids are coming but Paul needs me. No I do not know ! I am in Aix, he was transferred 6 months ago. You are not listening to me. I don't know when I'm coming home. By the way, I have your scarf. Take mine. Hearts go with everything. Good morning sir. The police station. - Go upstairs. - Do not. I was talking to the taxi. Hello, I am looking for Cne Danceny. Cne Jourdan, PJ from Lyon. He left me a message early this morning. - He's in custody. - In custody ? - For intentional homicide. - What ? Who is the victim ? - It's a doctor. But the Cne could not do that. - Can you keep this for me? Do you think he's innocent? - Yes. - I have a favor to ask of you. Do you have the interpellation report? - He wrote to you 20 minutes before his death. "Come if you want to know how I'm going to knock you down!" And yesterday you almost came to blows with him. It was you who killed Dr Fabian? Your daddy wo n't be able to do anything for you. Someone knocked. What ? - Hello, prosecutor. I read the PV. It's a stunt. Cne Marie Jourdan, PJ of Lyon. - Lt, put Mrs. Machin outside. - She will ensure my defense. - So I have the right to talk to him. It's the law. - Captain, you are in the process to bury you on your own. - Hello Marie. - Good-morning Paul. - Happy to see you. - Are we going elsewhere? I need a coffee, I was woken up very early this morning. - It's okay, Lt, we're not going to fly away. Gerfaut will not let go of me. HE got me in the nose. - If it were easy, I would have already left. Stopped. - Yes… The little noises. - Do you know who could have tricked you? - At this point, I don't know. - Why are you angry with Fabian? - There have been thefts in the rooms of the clinic. The boss is a local star. The proc was zealous and went after the employees whose papers were not in good standing. - You had to do the dirty work. - Yes. Fabian turned me on in the press so I freaked out when I received his text and I went for it. - You are the ideal scapegoat. You have to prove that he was dead when you arrived. You are not the killer. - Sofia, Lt Zamara knows the coroner very well. Go to IML with her. I'll get you out of here. - It's not too legal, what we're going to do. - It's hard to get out of the way but you want to that Danceny be cleared? - Yes. - The coroner likes you? - I hope. - She won't report us to the trial? - No. - So it's up to you. What did you tell him? - That we would go on ski vacation. I wanted to go to the sea. We're together, actually. - I thought I heard. Hello. Cne Jourdan, PJ from Lyon. - I have a problem with the autopsy. The victim was hit to the head with a blunt object. But the blow was not fatal. - Bruises do not correspond to blows. Looks like traces of a shock. - I have the radios. - Ah. Very well. - We have a fractured femur and clavicle. - And a head trauma the cause of death. - A polytrauma body like…. - A traffic accident. He must have been hit in front of the clinic. - Since the departure of his daughter, Cne Danceny sold his car. - Thanks, Sofia. Good news. The time of death is missing. - Now ? - Yes. - To exonerate the Cne. - You like him, your captain. - She is jealous. The lawyer is formal, Fabian died before 6:30 a.m. You received the text at 6:47 a.m. - So he was already dead. - Exactly. And you were with someone before 6:30 am? - No, I was alone. - Paul. - What ? - The prosecutor wants your skin. Even if you couldn't kill Fabian and if he was dead before the text, he won't let go. No, is this a girl's story? - She's married. - And ? - With the boss of the clinic. - Mr. prosecutor? - Marie! - Hold the line. - My client has an alibi. - I remember you. An alibi ? - Mrs. Vandeuil. - Thank you. Hello. - Hello, Mrs. - Mr. Gerfaut. - Thank you for coming. Sit down, please. - I am Cne Jourdan. I asked to summon you. Paul Danceny is charged with murder. I will be direct. Did you spend the night with him? - Yes. I spent the night with him. I was in the bathroom when he left before 7am. - At what address ? - In a friend's house. The neighbors saw us yesterday. Paul and I weren't keeping this house for the first time. - My husband - And ... has no suspicion about my relationship with Paul Danceny. Mr. Gerfaut, I am neither proud nor ashamed of what I do. I would just appeal to your tact to keep what is said here. You know my husband. He's the type to kill the messenger bad news. - Count on me, Mrs. Lt Zamara will take your testimony which will remain confidential. - Thank you. We can lift Mr. Danceny's custody. - I won't give you the investigation. - Yes. You tried to get rid of me. Either I talk to the Attorney General about you or I solve the case. A solved murder would do your eventual promotion good. - The killer wanted to trap him. Isn't that enough for you? - You have 4 days. And for her? - Cne Jourdan is investigating with me. A pain in the ass and the best cop that I know. - Thank you. -4 days ! - You are sulking ? - "She's investigating with me"! Couldn't you ask my opinion? My son has just arrived with his wife and two grandchildren! You do not care ! - I need you. - Are you going to do bullshit? - Possible. - On s'y met. Dr Fabian, it was Abbé Pierre with a white coat and a stethoscope. - And a St-Juste side that could annoy. Not just the cops. - A holy man killed. - A cop we wanted to charge with murder. - Don't you make it personal? - No. I just want to know who wanted to charge me. - It's a consignment hearses? - For the transport of patients. - Are they available? - Yes. - What do you want ? - Where are the keys to the vehicles? - It's the staff who… - Are you showing us around? Dr Keller. What is your specialty? - Plastic surgery. - She runs the clinic. - Under the orders of Dr Vandeuil. We will do our best to help you with the investigation. - Most ? - We have often patients from the world of politics, business, sport, so if you could be discreet ... - Sure. We're leaving and I'll leave your number with Mr. Fabian's family. It was to change him from his dispensary in Marseille. - He liked this place. He spent his days and nights there. He worked a lot and had settled in his office. - Hence his presence at 6.30am? - Can we see his office? - Where do you think you are? At the camping ? - Not kidding. - For Dr Vandeuil and me, respect and well-being of patients is essential. For Gabriel too. - Money too. We are far from the public hospital. - Money is a means, not an end. 20 years ago, when I met Dr Vandeuil, he was a surgeon in the army. - Go ahead, please. - It's him ? - Like always, you heal very well. You will love yourself. - Not as much as I adore you. - We will be able to program the abdominoplasty and the replacement of breast implants. See that at the secretariat. - Thank you. - You push for consumption. - Dr Marc Vandeuil, I present to you Cne Jourdan. - You are interesting. - Forget. - Can we talk to you? - Sure. Come with me. - You're taking care of Mrs Lichenko. - She'll moan if it's not you. - She's still moaning. Follow me. - What is a foot lift? - A technique that I created. The women who wear high heels no longer have natural shock absorbers so we reconstitute the pad. You shouldn't be concerned. - My pads are fine. - Ah. Here is Clémence, my daughter. - Hello. - She's a surgeon and works here. These police are investigating Gabriel's death. - If I can help.… - Thank you. - What was Gabriel Fabian doing in this clinic who breathes the ISF full nose? - You like clichés. Trying to understand is harder. - Understand what ? - He created a service for the most disadvantaged. - Completely free. - It didn't do much. - The administration is a crushing machine but we continued thanks to Gabriel's talent. - Was he dedicated to the project? - No. He did the preoperative consultations and the medical follow-up. - He was in conflict with colleagues, patients? - Or the gendarmes. - No. He was appreciated by all. He was very human. Very generous. - Did he have someone? - Do not. His life was his job. - Thank you. We leave you to your pads. - Dr. Fabian's office. - Thank you. - He had made a real little nest. - Home Sweet Home. Too bad he was dead, he looked nice. More than Vandeuil and his assistant. Keller, I can't smell her. - The Vandeuil girl looks normal. - Yes. Ah I think I found Fabian's watch. - May be. He didn't have one at the autopsy. Hey, it's interesting. You're not the only one who doesn't like Keller. There is a file on her. They were in conflict over just about everything. - Interesting. Sent by Fabian to Vandeuil. "Stop the harassment. Choose between Keller or me. "One of us has to go." He sent it yesterday morning. - Sorry. Do you know where we can find Dr. Keller? - She's in intervention. I warn her. For the block, go through the shop by Mme Vandeuil. - Thank you. - Didn't you forget to tell me something? Your mistress work here? - She has a range of cosmetics and food supplements and opened a shop here. We just have to ask him questions about Keller, Fabian, all that. - That's what I feared. You are in love. - Here's some hyaluronic acid. - Well. - Products all contain exclusively vegetable formulas . - I'm taking it for 6 months. - Cne Jourdan. You are ? - Mrs. Vandeuil's assistant. - Can we talk to you in peace? - Sure. Jeanne, please. - Yes. - Are you replacing me? - Sure. - Goodbye, Mrs. Devel. - Goodbye see you soon. - Do you know why Dr Keller hated Dr Fabian? - She can't stand having her relationship with my husband disturbed . I paid the price. - She was in love with him? - In love, I don't know, but it's a disruptive element ... malicious. - That is to say ? - She did everything to dissuade Marc from opening my shop here or to work with her daughter or to hire Fabian whom she hated. - Did she see him as a threat? - You think that.… ? - You know he told your husband to choose between her and him? - No. But we never bring our professional worries into our privacy. Even if there is not much left. - Sorry. - Jeanne, the shop. - Dr Vandeuil wants packaging projects. - Fine, I'll go. - No, he doesn't want to bother you. - Where are you going ? - A patient has complications. I go to her house. - You might think you're running away. - Where were you this morning between 6 and 7? - I was running. Single. - Pity. You are going to have to follow us. - What's going on ? - Everything is fine, Do not worry. - Let's go? - Why would I kill him? The Dr. Vandeuil would not have chosen. - Why ? - I have worked with him for 20 years. HE needs me. - But his daughter replaced you in the OR and he hired Fabian. You weren't of much use to him anymore . - That's what he must be thinking. It does not renew your contract. - That's why you opposed Fabian and his project. You knew you were in danger. You are not married, you have no children. The clinic is your life. - You were afraid of the choice of your boss and you eliminated - No. your rival. - Do you know Thierry Halimi, Julie Moreau, Grégory Frugoli? 13 operations canceled after consultation with Dr Fabian. - When you provided preoperative consultations, all patients were validated. That must have pissed you off a lot. - Not bad. She has a motive, no alibi. - But she does not defend herself, it bothers me. We're going to keep it for a bit. - We should know how Fabian dissuaded patients. But we don't have the medical records. - We have the coordinates. Hello. Julie Moreau? - Yes. - Police Cne. - What can I do for you? - Dr Fabian examined you just before an operation. - Yes. Did he have a problem? - Yes. He is dead. - I started the surgery when my husband left me for a 28 year old girl. I needed to prove to myself that I could please, I went at the Vandeuil clinic. In 3 years, I had a facelift, the lips, 2 liposuction, the breasts. - Did Dr. Vandeuil operate on you? - I have been redone everywhere but still unhappy! Until Dr Fabian. - That is to say ? - He made me understand that the concern was my head, not my body. - What's in it. - So he listened to me. And he spoke to me. And suddenly I realized that maybe it wasn't because I wasn't young and beautiful anymore that my husband was gone, that it wasn't my fault. - You canceled the operation. - Yes. I understood that Vandeuil had taken advantage of my weakness to sell me anything. - You must have been angry. - Yes ! And I made it known by killing him and his clinic on social media, and I was not the only one. - Can I see the testimonials? - Sure. - Thank you for this info. Bye. I had 10 patients. Fabian dissuaded them. - Julie Moreau said the same and showed me some trashy comments. The clinic is being demolished. - Is that so ? - Customers have gone to compete and for less. You imagine ? Vandeuil must have been angry. - Beatrice Keller would protect him? - For at least 20 years. - Mrs. Keller had something to eat. She's staying tonight? - Yes. Thank you. Tomorrow, check to see if anyone saw her on their jogging route. - At your command, Cne. - Sofia. Thank you. For everything. - You invite me to dinner? I have earned it. - It's true. But I live with my father during the work. Will it be okay? - I'll be happy to meet him. What does he like? Flowers, wine, chocolate? Did you tell him about me? Is it the Palace of Versailles? Is it okay if I don't have my long dress? - Don't worry. It's me ! I have a guest. Please come in. - It's huge. I call you Your Highness? - Good evening Madam. Edouard Danceny, Paul's father. Pdt of the Aix Court of Appeal. - Marie Jourdan period. Cne of the Lyon PJ. - You could have warned. - It's my fault. I embedded myself. - Were you taken into custody? - I don't call you at the first concern. And Marie was there. You come ? - Finally, in Lyon. And have your defense assured by a police officer! - Not all cops are incompetent or stupid. - He's released and we have the investigation. - You must have been lucky. - Don't take it for yourself, Marie. He does not digest that I am not a judge. - If I had been ashamed of you, I wouldn't have asked you to transfer to Aix. - It's not just that, you know that. - Nice, this drawing. It was you who did it ? - No. - It's my wife. - She hasn't come home yet? - No. She's a juvenile judge. She is in Noumea. - Good evening. I'm going, Mr. Danceny. The chicken is in the oven. - Thank you, Florence. - Good evening. She has been shopping and cooking for my father since my mother…. - I think she said the chicken was ready. - Let's go. - That was delicious. Do you know Marc Vandeuil? - Yes ! Upstart, megalomaniac. He attracts and fascinates the worst: money, vanity, appearing. - Your great friend. - He is very strong. He created an association for the children of Haiti. He gets filmed and disappears on the other side of the island, in the Dominican Republic, where he has a luxurious villa and a boat. - Oh yes. - I tried to corner him for the opaque financing of his clinic when I was attorney general. - He has a lot of friends. - Pay attention. He is attractive but ready for anything if threatened. - Well received. Thank you for your hospitality. Can you take me home? There must be a hotel not far away. - You can sleep here. - I do not want to disturb. But I love Relais et Châteaux. - There is a spare bedroom. - With pleasure. There is heavy and collector's item. It is a museum to your glory. It's weird to have kept all of that. - That must make them younger. It amuses my daughter. Especially the photos of me young. - You haven't changed too much. It's not Lorraine Vandeuil in the photo? - Yes, it's her. - She was beautiful. Hold. - Thank you. - Paul and Lorraine were the star couple from law school. And then she wanted to introduce herself at A Miss Contest. His life has changed. - She was free to choose. - I was close to her when she wanted to become a judge. She deserved better than to become Marc Vandeuil's wife. Have a good evening. - Good night. Tell him you're sleeping with your childhood friend, he'll be delighted. - It's my life. It's none of his business. Your room is there. - Order, Cne Danceny. Don't you want to talk to her about it because she's married? - But no. HE would have nothing to say to me . He has never been exemplary. - Yes. - He was cheating on your mother? I was close to her. She left because of her bullshit. - That's why you're hard on him. A ring. Good night. - Good night. - HI ? I'm glad to hear from you. No, I'm not going home right away. Yes, it's more complicated. This moron Paul is in love, but not necessarily with the right person. Okay, we'll remember tomorrow. I kiss you hard, my darling. Kiss Kiss. What do you put in your eggs, honey? Truffle oil? No, in my opinion, the Lord does not know how to open a can of tuna. - Hum. Hello .. - I'll leave you. Hello Mr. Danceny. - Cne Jourdan. - Hello. A problem ? - No. Your friend used to say how incompetent the owner was. A ring. - Sorry, it's Sofia. HI ? Yes. Very well. Ah… That's right. - New ? -2 witnesses saw Béatrice Keller run at the hour of murder. - Dr. Pète-sec has an alibi. - She's also sending us pictures she found on Keller's cell phone. Beeps. - It's not Doisneau but we recognize you well. - And Vandeuil didn't say anything. - Maybe to get you accused. - I'm calling Lorraine. - No ! This is our investigation. - I appreciate your work. You have made yourself indispensable. I like it. - Thank you, Dr. - I did well to trust. Mme, how is this treatment going? - Much better than in Monte-Carlo. I will be in good shape for the facelift. - It was the goal. Good day. I would like to entrust you more responsibilities. Would you like to work with me to the development of aesthetic care? - Thank you. Won't that bother your wife? - No, I'm the one who decides. - I'm going back to the store. - Don't forget the evening with American brands. - Sure. - Dr. Vandeuil. - I heard about Dr Keller. I am sorry. - Don't worry, she has an alibi. - Can we talk to you? - I have to postpone an appointment. - Here is. - Sit down. - I'll be direct. Fabian started to ruin your business by advising your patients against operations. - A mistake. - For your banker. - Not for Mme Moreau, for example. - By what right do you judge people, the discomfort, the malaise, whatever the sex, age, physique of the person? - You recite to us vote for the press kit? - That's what I tell patients. As for Gabriel, he did not have my experience and was not a surgeon. - The day before the murder, Security saw you arguing with him. - It was getting annoying so you eliminated it. - Well, that's enough, I have work. And this is especially valid for you. - Sorry ? - You would like to get rid of it. You received this 3 days ago. - Marie ! - So you killed Fabian and you made your wife's lover wear the hat . It's human. - I didn't kill Gabriel Fabian. After our altercation, my daughter dissuaded me from firing him. She went to see Him and everything was all right. For Lorraine, I asked her if this matter was important. And apparently not. You will disappear as quickly as you appeared. - See you later, Dr. - Why did you show these pictures? It's my life. - You sleep with his wife so it's also his life. - It was useless. We had it. - No, he's cold, calculating. He needed an electric shock. Pull yourself together, Paul! - My father was furious against Gabriel. I convinced him not to fire him. It was a matter of timing. Gabriel wanted to open his department quickly. And my father is going to open a clinic in Nice in 3 months. - How long have you been with Gabriel ? The watch that you are wearing in the photo was found in the victim's bed. - Can we go out, please? - Why didn't you talk about this relationship? - It's forbidden. My father refuses to allow staff to have relationships outside of work. A physiotherapist and a nurse were dismissed. I have to lead by example. - Was it serious? - He was unique. I don't know how I'm going to do without him. Two months ago, he suggested that I leave. It wasn't right for him here. He wanted to do humanitarian work. - You refused. - I couldn't leave my father. I asked for a little time. He was unhappy but he accepted. One beep. Sorry. I am expected in the OR. - Thank you. If we were going to take stock? - I invite you to the restaurant. - With pleasure. They argue because they are exhausted . Look after the children for a day. No, I'm not coming home. We are moving forward but it is not yet that. I'll call you back. I kiss you too. It’s not easy. - You're a mother hen. - Are you saying that? Who had put a GPS beacon on his daughter's scooter? - It has nothing to do. It was complicated, it was The Adolescent Crisis. - It's complicated to be a parent. But fabulous. - Exactly… Your son… Alex, is that it? How is he ? I mean, I mean ... By.… By.… - Does he look like me? - Yes ! - Yes, he looks like me. He has my eyes, my bad temper. For the rest, he stems from his father. It was Pierre who wanted a child. Me too, but I was scared. Me, I am an accident of life. But I don't know if I would have had the courage to give birth to a child like me. 1 in 4 chance. But life does things well. When the midwife put this screaming little bit on me , who gesticulated with big arms and big legs, I knew it was won. I was just going to have to live up to it. - You're still up to the task. - No. I did what I could. It must have been hard for Alex. I was armored. He often came home from school with red eyes because we made fun of his little mother. He went to his father so as not to hurt me. Now he's a good son, a good father. Even if he has trouble with his two children! Shall I show them to you? - Yes. - The little one is 4 years old. This is Louis, my grandson. He holds his 3 month old sister. Eleanor! - Ah. She would be fine with my father. We will make sure that you leave quickly. - I have notified Mrs. Keller the end of her police custody. - You wanted to protect your boss if he had committed a crime. - Clémence confirms that between Fabian and you, he had chosen. - Clémence was crazy about Fabian. - You know everything ! Did you take pictures? - Love makes you blind. - What ? - For the past few weeks, Fabian has been harming the clinic. - Yes. By discouraging patients. - Not only. He was hiding things. I don't know what. He knew what he was doing. - Why would he want to harm the clinic where he worked? - He thought he had been manipulated. - It was true ? - Apparently, Dr Vandeuil is an expert in this field. - Thank you, Dr Keller. Clicks. Paul. - Pardon. - Vandeuil no longer has a mobile. Clémence had settled The problem between him and Fabian. - We have to find what Fabian was hiding. - It could have killed him. - In a Fabian drawer, I found corticosteroid ampoules for intramuscular injection. Empty. - Maybe he was sick. We need a blood test. "And see who prescribed them for him." You have to look for prescriptions. - What about his phone records? - There's a lot calls to Jeanne Daguerre, and SMS where they meet. - Lorraine's assistant. - Yes. The last date from the day before the murder at 8:34 p.m. - We're going to go see the young lady. - I called, she's already gone. - Miss Daguerre. - Yes ? - Mme Vandeuil told us where to find you. - I bought an outfit for the reception tonight. - You had an affair with Dr Fabian? - Do not ! - You were jealous of Clémence? - The crime of passion is a timeless one. - Where were you yesterday between 6 and 7 a.m.? - Home. I live in a roommate, the others will confirm. - Can we get you some coffee? We have questions. - Dr Fabian and I were friends. He knows my boyfriend. We were n't comfortable at the clinic. - That is to say ? - All these armored people live by appearances, think themselves important. We did not share these values. - Did you see each other often? - HE went to the store when Ms. Vandeuil left and we talked about the products, the patients. - Did you know he was with Clemence? - No. But I got it. She was jealous. - He called you the day before the murder. - He had just decided to stay. He doubted. I suggested that he celebrate in Marseille. I have pictures. - What time did you get home? - I dropped it off at 5:30 a.m. - And you haven't noticed anything special? It is important. - Dr. Vandeuil's office was on. - Marc Vandeuil ? - Clemence. - Yes, I was jealous. I knew Gabriel loved me. He kept telling me. But I was afraid of losing him. - You imagined the worst when he didn't answer. - I thought something had happened to him . I spent the night waiting for him. I called all the hospitals. - You saw him come back with Jeanne Daguerre, you made up your mind. - He got closer to her after you refused to leave. - He wanted to be free. Maybe not with the boss's daughter. - Do not. Gabriel was having trouble with the clinic but ... it had nothing to do with us. He loved me. The last time I saw him I said horrors. - What did he say? - He reassured me. He said i was the woman of his life and that we would be leaving soon. That he would make sure that I didn't refuse. - What ? - I do not know. I was too pissed off. I left. I'm back home. And he is dead. - Thank you, Miss Vandeuil You stay in Aix, please. - Sure. Will you let me know? - Obviously. - Are you okay, darling? - Yes, I am fine. - My lawyer is coming in 10 minutes. I have been kind. But you will regret approaching my family. - When I come after you, you will know it. - Dad, everything is fine. They just questioned me. - At the gendarmerie? And without a lawyer? Why she ? She has nothing to do with Fabian. - It might be time to tell him the truth, Mlle Vandeuil. - We were together, dad. We were very much in love. - I am sorry. - I have a consultation in 20 minutes. Can I cool off here? - Sure. I accompany you. - I'll take you home. - I'm making myself a coffee. Does that tell you? Do you want to drink nothing? You have been well with Clémence. - It surprises you ? - We would have said that you had a heart. - For what it pays. My father dedicated his life to others. The poor, the old, the children, the needy. He had 20 people at his funeral, nothing on his account. - You opened your clinic after his death? - Exactly. Kindness is outdated. What's nice with the rich, is that their recognition is numbered. - On your account. - Yes. - You think you have more than 20 people at your funeral? - Let's go? - Goodbye. - Don't call, I can't help you. - The killer is within your walls. I will find him. Even if I have to shut down your clinic. - Good luck, Jourdan. Let's go? - Gabriel was in love with Clémence. She was telling the truth. - For him, she was the woman of his life. - He wanted to go with her. How could he be sure that she would follow Him? - He knew some confusing things. This is what was to hurt at the clinic. - Gabriel got closer to Jeanne when Clémence refused to leave. - A relationship without ambiguity. - Tomorrow morning, we ask Jeanne why Fabian joined her at the store as soon as Lorraine was away. - Thank you for your help. - Thank you. My husband is a chef, I can never cook. I will finish. - Thank you. - You allow ? Do you read Shakespeare? - Yes. A gift. I just started. - I prefer detective novels but "Romeo and Juliet", it is timeless. Nice ring. Is it Art Deco? - Yes that's it. Well I'm leaving. - See you tomorrow. - See you tomorrow. - I know about you and this gendarme. I saw pictures. It's very disturbing. For me, obviously. But for you too. Without me, without my money, you have nothing. You are nothing. - 10 years ago when you met me , you were nothing. - I used your beauty, your little notoriety to make myself known. You as i l'intelligence to bet on me and you have reaped a lot of benefits. Isn't it, my love? It's time to move on , for you and me. - Do you think of Jeanne? - When the investigation is over, you can take your things and live your beautiful story with the handsome captain. When I talk about your business, I'm not talking about the store. I want loyalty and discretion. - Your husband is very competent. Menus at 15 euros devalue his talent. - It's a choice. He doesn't care about the stars. He wants generous, quality and accessible cuisine . - Oh yes. By the way, I had Chloe. We could join her in London for Christmas. - I was planning to go to Noumea. She hasn't seen her grandmother for a year. One beep. Sorry. This is the job. There is a computer failure. - A computer failure? - Yes. - Good luck. - Thank you. - We're going to have to get to know each other. - I am sorry. - How's Paul? HE talks to you, right? With me, it's complicated. Okay, I plead guilty. I was not a very good father. - According to Paul, you are a very good grandfather. If I may, he holds you responsible for his mother's departure at the end of the world. I do not judge. - I never cheated on my wife. My reputation as a seducer is false. In my job, I have always wanted to be respected, admired. But deep down, it's not me. One evening, Hélène came home and told me that she had met someone and was going to Noumea. - Why did you say ... - I prefer people talk about me as a seducer than a cuckold. - But your son? - He's always been close to her. He respects Her. I don't want to ruin this. - No. - Didn't her mother tell her? I have been an absent father and a selfish husband. I have to catch up. "The fool thinks he is wise and the wise man recognizes himself as crazy." - Here, Shakespeare. Want to catch up? Talk to Paul. It's up to you to do it. It smells of the dawn. Is it your computer failure? - How are you ! - It's true, don't tell me anything, it's like that with the Dancenys. - You let go? - I can go back to Lyon! - As you wish, the proc has just summoned me. - The day starts well. You take me to the clinic before going to the proc? Please. Thank you so much. How was Dr. Fabian interested in your work? - He was interested in customers, food supplements, to the role of Dr Vandeuil. - That's all ? - Once, he asked me for a file on the composition of the products. - Can you forward this file to me? - Yes of course. - Thank you. - Gerfaut took me down. Vandeuil threatens to file a harassment complaint . - Don't tell me you've been protecting her from the start? - What are you talking about ? - Jeanne sent me a file with the products that Lorraine sells. They contain genetically modified molecules that make people have heart disease, anemia or suicide. For 3 years, they are banned by the Medicines Agency. - What are you going to do ? - I summon Lorraine Vandeuil. She was able to kill Fabian. And I hope you weren't involved in this. - But Lorraine is innocent. - Open your eyes. She could lose everything. Her job, her husband. You are in the middle of it all! You must withdraw from the investigation. - Let me withdraw? Like you did when we investigated your sister's death? - I want to question Lorraine Vandeuil here. - I finished the injections for the vertical wrinkles. Raise your eyebrows, I'm going to prick the frontal muscle. Here is. Well. - Sorry. I can see you ? - Yes. I will be back. - The police are taking Lorraine away. - Do not worry. They're going to take his testimony. She has nothing to be ashamed of. - Fabian told me that my products were dangerous. He had analyzed them. I was afraid he was right and I was going to act. - You do not know the composition of what you sell? * -I had a limited loan. I had to do it quickly with little. I went to the cheapest and the fastest. A company in Albania. - No ! - Are you down? I'm 40 years old and my husband doesn't look at me anymore! I need to have something when he tells me he's leaving me. - Are you with Paul to prove to yourself that you can seduce? - I do not know. - That's none of my business. Your products were blocked at customs. How did you do ? * -I asked Paul. And shit! - Are you kidding me. - I didn't know they were dangerous. - If she dives, you dive. - And his alibi? I was with her. - You saw it ? When you left, she was in the bathroom. She offered you an alibi to concrete one. If she killed Fabian, she'll be Free thanks to you. When did you know that Fabian would denounce you? - I did not know. - You were kidding me. - Paul. - You seduced the con cop to cover your shit traffic. - I have always been sincere. My feelings… - Such-toi! You killed a man. You did everything to make me accuse. - I never lied to you. I didn't kill Gabriel Fabian. - I don't care what it's going to cost me but you're going to pay. - Paul, now get out. - What ? You were right, she took me for an asshole. You're happy. Leave me alone. A telephone rings. * -You are on Paul Danceny's mailbox . - It's weird that he's not answering. - We're on a complicated investigation. - When he's late, Paul always warns. - You're not answering us! - What now ? I did not answer ? Did I disappoint you again? You should be used to it! Marie is right, we should talk to each other! Yes, I'm sleeping with Lorraine. - You do what you want with your life. - Still happy. You would be in a bad position to advise me. Except me, Lorraine is accused of murder and used me. But thanks to my friend, I opened my eyes. You are right, I shame your name. Because I'm just a poor little shit policeman. - Listen to me, Paul. I know Lorraine. She is incapable of killing. Go on. We're going to have a cup of coffee. Come. - I hadn't felt that since my divorce. I think I wanted to be in love. I needed to feel something strong. It had to be with Lorraine. - Love has its reasons that reason ignores. - I don't want to look like you. If you had controlled your feelings, mom would be here. - I never cheated on your mother. It was she who left me for another. - Honey, it's me. You have a little voice. Ah yes, babies cry at night. Someone knocked. Yes. - Jeanne had an accident. She is dead. - Sorry, an emergency. What was she doing there at 6 o'clock? - We'll find out quickly. - Did your father talk to you? - Yes. - You could be wrong about your parents. - Yes. As for Lorraine. You'll get mad but I can't believe she killed Fabian. - I am okay. The death of Jeanne Daguerre reshuffles the cards. So, Sofia? - A car cut him off. There are no witnesses. - So it's no accident. - I would be the killer, I hide there and when the motorbike arrives, I cut him off and I send him in daisies. - There are tire tracks. - I'll have this analyzed. - It could match the vehicles from the clinic. We would even be murderers. - And a second murder. - It's good to be close to the ground. Sofia, please I don't have my gloves. - Lydie Marguet. - You send this to the lab. - Jeanne Daguerre was fleeing. She must have felt threatened. But by whom? - I'm sure it's the same assassin as Fabian. - Jeanne's mother died after an operation at the clinic. The locket was his mother's. I found an article. - Thank you. - 6 months ago, she underwent liposuction after the installation gastric band. She returned home and died 24 hours later. Cardiac arrest. - We know why Jeanne approached Vandeuil. - Fabian helped her prove that Vandeuil had caused the death of a patient. - Vandeuil has a motive for double murder. - We need proof. - This is Ms. Marguet's postoperative report. - Thank you. - Obviously. Dr Keller. - Yes. - It was you who operated on Lydie Marguet, who died? That's your name there. Not that of Dr. Vandeuil. - We will quickly prove that there was a medical error, which may be the motive for 2 murders. - I have nothing to do ... - You will continue to sacrifice life and career for a long time for a man who uses you? - You're much better than that. - I was asked to remove the doctor's name and put mine there. It wasn't the first time. - Nobody ever said anything? - Confidentiality clause. - Dr Vandeuil, please follow us. - You freed Lorraine? If it's for an apology, do it there. I asked the prefect for your heads. - Don't play that. It is useless. - I have a plasty meeting in 5 minutes for the wife of a deputy. - You will explain to him that you killed 2 people to save your clinic. - Pathetic stories are starting to annoy me of a little cop and his other half. Looks like a cartoon, both of you. - Are you following us with or without handcuffs? - Don't forget your accessories. Gabriel Fabian was in love with your daughter. He wanted to prove to her that daddy's clinic was rotten so you killed him. - And you killed Jeanne Daguerre who understood about her mother. She had enough evidence. - I didn't kill either Gabriel or Jeanne. I made a mistake during the operation by Mme Margquet. I hit the intestinal wall. A wrong path. - To protect your reputation, you falsified the record. - And it wasn't the first time. - And Fabian understood why. These are traces of bites. - We found these drugs in Fabian. The same as those in your office. You are sick. - These corticosteroids are used to treat pathologies that make the extremities tremble. - What is annoying for a surgeon. - I have been treated for 9 months. I am in the process of stabilization. Ask my neurologist. Yes. I am proud, ambitious, I made serious mistakes but I did not kill. Where were you at the time of the crime? - Home. Alone. - And this morning between 6 am and 6:30 am? - I was called for an emergency. In those hours. - We'll check. We have his confession! - For the medical error. - He gave his mobile. - We'll check his alibi. Are you freeing her? - Yes. We have the culprit. And she was there, she didn't kill Jeanne. - Go talk to him. - I'm so sorry, Paul. I never lied to you. I loved the woman I saw in your eyes. I believed it. - Me too. We must have needed that breath of fresh air in our lives to experience something strong, to go back. - When everything was simple. When everything was still possible. - Except it was 20 years ago. Lots of things have changed. - I regret nothing. - Neither do I. - Am I free, then? - Indictment for importing and selling illegal products but… you're free, yes. - OK. OK, thank you very much, Dr. Vandeuil's neurologist confirms that seizures could occur at any time. He had to have someone on hand at all times. - Beatrice Keller. - During the period that interests us, she was on vacation and he continued to operate. I only see one other person. - Where are you going ? - You don't want to go to the clinic? - Yes, I dream of it! I hope we get the car involved in the accident. - It's lura. Clémence requested this room when his father started to have worries. - Surely to be available in case he needs her. - Fabian must not like it. - We have known better for romantic evenings. Do you find something? - I look for. This is interesting. Letters from Vandeuil. He is in France and writing to his daughter who is in the United States. - The parents were divorced. "I love you, even though your mom has to say horrible things about me. "Your silence "will never stop me from writing to you and loving you." She didn't answer him. - The mother may have hidden the letters. How hard. until 2007. She joined her father after his surgery studies. - To make up for lost time. - But she met Fabian. So either she stayed with her father, or she was leaving with the man she loved. For love, we can do a lot. - It's good. You rest for 3 days and you hydrate. And no alcohol. See you in 2 weeks. Bye. - Miss Vandeuil. Your father has been freed. - He had an alibi for this morning. - You knew that better than anyone. - What ? - Because your cell phone was located at the scene of the accident. - We should never having to choose between blood ties and heart ties. You must have suffered a lot. - I did not want to. - Gabriel wanted to free you from the nefarious hold of your father. - He understood that he was operating with neurological pathology. He threatened to reveal everything. So you killed him. - I couldn't let him destroy our lives, to my father and me. I found my father a year ago. When my mother died. My parents divorced when I was 6 years old. My mother raised me in the idea that my father was a bastard, that he had never loved me. She lied to me. - You found the letters. - It was a shock. Even if deep down, I always knew he loved me. I became a surgeon to be like him. When we met it was an incredible feeling. Very strong. For both. - You have become his heiress, his disciple, you were unique. - It must have been hard to wear. Especially when he has asked you to operate for him. But why Jeanne? - She understood that I was operating instead of my father and that I was responsible for his mother's accident. I had no choice. - We always have the choice. - We're gonna have to go. - I'm sorry. Forgive me. - Clemence. - Go on. - Hum. - Here, sugar. - I'll put it away. - OK. - Mr. Danceny, are you going to hide it for a long time? - Sorry ? - Florence. It's obvious that you are together. Why not assume? - It is complicated. - Is that so. You are not from the same world? She is cleaning, cooking. You, Lions Club, tennis. - Not at all. - So what is it ? - I do not know. Without Florence, I would never have recovered from my wife's departure. She was of such generosity, sensitivity. I'm fine with her. But I have this stupid apprehension ... this fear of new failure. - Mr. Danceny, do you like him? She loves You. So trust to love. How are you, Paul? - It's my daughter. We join her in London this weekend with dad. - Exactly, Paul, Do you mind if there are 4 of us? If Florence comes? If she wants to, of course. Because I really want to. - Everything's fine, Florence. - Thank you. - Oh yes anyway. Did you know? - Yeah. - Well then…. Great ! I am delighted for you. Of course, we leave at 4. - I invite you to the restaurant. - With pleasure, Marie. - He called me Marie. Can I call you Edouard? - Absolutely not. Are you going to stay with us for a while? - No, I leave after the meal to find my tribe. - Thank you anyway. Thanks for Paul and thanks for everything. - You will have to come and see me. - With joy. Shall we get our stuff? - They are cute. - Am I from your family too? - Considering what you have made me live for 4 days, I confirm it to you. - I love you. - Me too. - You don't repeat it to your husband!
