CITY OF B Nur. What are you looking at? Nothing. -Let's go. -Okay. Right. -Sir. -Miss. Can't we just ride the car? Unfortunately, we can't. The car can't get through the bridge. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. We're here. -We have arrived. -Right. -Excuse me. -Please. Sir, thank you. DISTRICT OF K How are you? Yes. This is my younger sister. -Ayu. -Prabu. And this is her friend. -Nur. -Hi. Mr. Prabu is the village head. He will be the supervisor of your extracurricular activities. Okay. Let's talk about this in my house. Let's go. This way. Nur? -What's wrong? -Nothing. Why can't they go? Poor Ayu. She and her friends need to do the extracurricular activity here. Please help her. I beg you, sir. We come from far away. We intend to contribute something good for the local people. Please consider it, sir. This is the first time for us as well. No one has asked to do the extracurricular activity here. That's why we can try it, right, sir? We will not be a burden. Our project will help the people. Whatever is the problem with this village, we will try to solve it. We want to help the villagers. This activity will benefit the community. Do you allow us, sir? Ms. Ayu. Ms. Nur... I am going to show you a location which could be suitable for your program. Thank you, sir. This place used to be a bathing place for the dancers. But... they don't exist anymore. No dancers in this village now. And then, it was used as a source of water of our village. But in the last few years, the water is drying out. So, the villagers have some difficulties getting water. Because the river is quite far from here. We can help, sir. We will make a plan to channel the water to this place. Well... Please do your best. A FEW WEEKS LATER Ouch... I have a flat bottom from sitting for too long. Is it alright? Is it still far away? About half an hour away. Alright. Might as well go to Bali. Come on, let's go. Keep your spirit up! Ayu... Are we walking? Damn it, are we riding on motorcycles? We're here? Thank you. Thank you, sir. -Mr. Prabu. How are you, sir? -Miss Ayu. Good. How's your trip? Guys, this is Mr. Prabu. He's the village head here. I'm Prabu. -Is this everyone? -Yes, sir. -Come. Follow me. -Come on. My apologies. Our village is a little behind. We don't have electricity yet. But I hope all of you can adapt. No worries, sir. I'm used to it. Here there's no electricity. Where I live, electricity is cut often because we don't pay the bills. Relax, sir. The houses here don't have bathrooms. So, if you want to take a bath, the boys can go to the river. And the girls can use the one bathroom stall at your work plan site. What if we need to poop? Poop? The river isn't that close from here so what we do usually is -we dig a hole in the ground. -Oh dear. That, I'm not used to. Excuse me, sir. On the way here, I heard the sound of gamelan. Is there another village nearby? Gamelan? Yes, sir. It sounded like a traditional ceremony. When did you hear it? On the way here. You must have misheard it. Don't let it bother you. Okay? Now, let me take you to where you'll be staying at. Okay, sir. Ma'am? Boys. Girls. This is Mrs. Sundari. For now the girls will stay at Mrs. Sundari's house. The boys will stay next door until a bigger place is ready. -Okay? -Okay, sir. Ma'am. I'll leave the girls to you. I can't say no, can I? Let's go, boys. I'll take you next door. -Thank you, sir. -Nur. Excuse me, ma'am. Thanks, Bima. I'll be going, ma'am. Thank you, Bima. Come in. Come, let's take a look. Widya. Why did you say you heard the sound of gamelan? Did you not hear it? Think before you speak. We literally just got here, don't start with strange questions. I gave my word that we will behave well. That's why he gave his permission for our program here. If anything happens, I'll be the one taking the blame. Ma'am. Almost all of the houses here are made of bamboo weaving. So, we can hear everything you say and see anything you wear. Well... If your program succeeds this "Sinden" would regain its function as the source of water for our village. Sinden? Yes. That's what we call this place. So, Ms. Ayu our villagers are ready to help. Pardon me. What is that? Oh that... The villagers remain respectful of the traditions of our ancestors. That's one of our ways to worship the universe and its inhabitants. I thought it was for summoning the devil, sir. Wahyu! There's no need to summon when the devil is already standing in front of me here. I'm joking, Mr. Wahyu. Don't take it to heart. But you're accurate, sir. He is the devil of our campus. Haunting the place for years. Graduating indefinitely. Okay. Come with me. Let's go, Mr. Bima. Nur. What's wrong? Nothing. This is our burial ground. What are we? Stupid? What? Watch your mouth. Excuse me, sir. Why are some gravestones covered by black cloths? Nothing special. That just means they're less than 10 years old. I see. Nothing else to be said about this graveyard. -Nur! -Nur. Are you okay? Ms. Ayu, maybe you should go back. Yes, sir. It's okay. I can take Nur. Let's go. Be careful. Let's go. Be careful. Most of the villagers plant corn. That's why every day they spend most of their time here. Sir. Where does that go? That is the way towards the woods. That monument marks the boundary between the village and the woods. Please... do not go near that monument. All of you cannot pass that boundary and must stay away from the woods. Why's that, sir? We call that area... Tapak Tilas. It's not our territory. Let's go. Widya. Let's split into groups for smaller programs. The first group will be Widya and Wahyu. Second, Nur and Anton. Third, Bima and I. Why don't we just divide into two groups? Widya with us, Wahyu with Nur and Anton. No, Bim. More effective with just two people in one group. So we can have three separate groups for three different programs. Bima said that he heard a voice from the woods. So he passed the monument to see where the voice came from but no one was there. Didn't Mr. Prabu tell us not to go into the woods? Don't ask me. Nur. Does Bima have a girlfriend? Ah so that's why it's just you and him in your group. Have you noticed there isn't anybody our age here? Maybe their children have gone to the big cities. All of them? Not even one stays? That's strange. Excuse me. -Careful, Nur. -Yeah. Nur. Don't take too long, okay? Okay. Nur? You haven't started? Widya? Widya? Widya! Nur? Widya, open the door! Widya! Forgive me, God... Forgive me, God... There is no deity but God... Nur? Forgive me, God... God, I ask for your protection from the cursed devils. Nur? What happened, Nur? You did not take a bath? Don't take too long, okay? Okay. Widya? -Are you done? -I am. Let's get out of here. Quick. Here's the coffee. For whom is the third cup of coffee? Ms. Nur? Why come at this hour? Come in. Sit down. Here. Sorry to bother you, sir. No worries. Excuse me. How can I help you? There's something I want to ask you. This is Mbah Buyut. He lives on the other side of the village. But he's an elder here. So please don't hesitate. You can ask me about anything. So... Ever since I arrived at this village, I feel there is something... weird. At first, I thought I was just seeing things. But... Drink the coffee. It's not polite to refuse the host. This coffee is prepared for you. Sorry, I don't drink coffee. Please, just drink it. Please. Is it sweet? What you saw is a creature that rules this place. He is one of hundreds that inhabits the village. The village that not everyone can see. He's angry because of what you brought to this village. What did I bring? She doesn't know that you've been looking after her all this time? Ms. Nur. He has promised to not bother you anymore. Don't worry. These students are my responsibility. Widya. Widya. Widya. Widya. Widya. Nur? Nur! Nur? Nur! Nur! Nur, what are you doing? Snap out of it, Nur! Snap out of it! Nur, please! Nur, snap out of it! Hey. What are you doing, Bima? Hey! Why the hell are you dancing at this hour? Get up. Why the hell are you dancing? Widya, hey! Why were you dancing? Widya, hey! Widya, hey! What is wrong with you? Hey! Who the hell dances this late at night? Hey. That's enough. Get inside. What are you doing out here? It's like she's possessed. Come on. What happened? Ladies first. Is this coffee or herbal medicine? It's so bitter. Don't just stare at your coffee. Come on. Drink it. I'm sorry, Mbah. I don't drink coffee. My stomach can't take it. Just one sip. You are warm blooded. Someone like you is well liked by them. This might help to make them stay away. You can stop worrying now. Sir... Why did only Widya get it? -You want it? -Of course. Finish the coffee first. Forget about it. I don't want it anymore. Thank you. Sir. Why did the coffee taste sweet only to me? That black coffee is usually used as an offering to our ancestors. Spirits love that coffee. To them, the coffee tastes sweet. I've had that coffee a few times it's always bitter. Maybe something is following you and is interested in you. But you don't need to worry. Okay? Mbah Buyut is here to help. Nur, I need to tell you something. Bima has been acting really strange lately. I often hear Bima moaning at night. The weird thing is I hear a woman moaning too from his room. You're talking nonsense, Anton. I'm serious, Nur! I didn't believe what I heard too at first. -Until I found offerings in his room! -Anton. I've been friends with Bima for a long time. I know what kind of person he is. That's impossible. Come with me. Hey, where are we going? See? Do you believe me now? Please come in. Come in boys. Starting tonight all of you will stay here. So you won't bother Mrs. Sundari anymore. -Okay? -Thank you, sir. Thank you, sir. The boys' room is over there. And the girls' room is over there. Okay? Remember. Behave yourselves. Okay? Yes, sir. Okay. Then I'll head home. Please rest. -Thank you, sir. -Okay. Night. Bima. I need to talk to you. Nur, we're going to look around. Come on. Don't forget to close your eyes if you want to sleep. Excuse me. Widya? What are you doing? What is it? Where are the boys? In their room. What is it, Widya? What's wrong? -What's wrong, Widya? -Calm down. Wait. -Calm down. -What's wrong, Widya? Calm down. Sit down. Get some water, now! What's going on? Come on, Anton. Here. Calm down. Calm down. Widya. Widya. Widya. Widya! Somebody's doing black magic on you! Sorry, Bima. I lost it. You lost it? How could you lose it? I asked you to give the "Bangle" to Widya. Sorry, Bim. I really forgot where I last put it. Why are you giving an old bracelet to Widya anyway? What's wrong with you? I trusted you with that. And now you lost it! I was wrong to trust you. You don't understand. There's a snake! A snake! Come on! That way! Let's go! What the hell is this? Mr. Prabu! There was a huge snake inside! But we can't find it now. Ms. Ayu. Was there really a snake in the kitchen? I didn't see any snakes, sir. What I saw in the kitchen were these men barging inside. I swear! I saw a big snake there! Okay. Listen. Ms. Nur and Ms. Ayu. Let's talk at my house. The past fews days there have been a few incidents. Maybe it's best to end your extracurricular activities now. Sorry? We haven't finished our programs yet. What happened earlier was just a misunderstanding. Ms. Nur, you understand why I'm saying this, right? -Peace be upon you. -And upon you. What's up with her? Hey, Nur. What did Mr. Prabu say? Where is Widya and Bima? Widya's in the room. As for Bima, God knows where. He's probably busy with his program. Right. Every time I pass by their work site, Bima and Ayu are not there. God forbid they went to Tapak Tilas. Anton. How much more time do we need to finish the "Sinden" program? Do you want to go home? Would the campus let us? If they found out, we might not graduate. Peace be upon you, Bima. Where were you, Bima? Have you prayed today? It's been a while since I saw you pray. My spiritual life is my own business. Not yours. Mind your own. Hey, Nur. Don't you want to ask about my spiritual life? Nur? -We got everything? -Yes. Hey, Widya. Let's buy some snacks. Get some for the others too. -How many? -Six please. Mixed with chili or separate? Separate, please. You don't look like from around here. I knew it. So where are you staying? Far from here. Deep into the woods. A village called... Wait. Into the woods? Listen to me. I suggest... That you find lodging to stay for tonight. Don't go into the woods at night. Even the locals here don't dare to go into the woods at this hour. Let alone you two who aren't from around here. Strange things might occur. What about it, Widya? Just kidding. I can't ask a good girl to spend the night. Unless she wants to, then I'm game 100% percent. It's fine. I'll drive really fast. All right. If you must go back tonight go ahead. But remember this... When you go into the woods be careful. Don't let your thoughts be empty. -Yes, sir. -And always pray. If something weird occurs just ignore it. -Just keep going. -Yes, sir. All right. What's the total? Fifteen thousand rupiah. Hey. Talk to me, Widya. So I know that you're still behind me. Drive faster. It's already late. Hey, just imagine if this motorcycle suddenly broke down. That'd be the end of us. In the middle of woods like this, where to find repair shops, right? What happened? -Don't joke around, Wahyu! -I'm not! Let me check the gas. Oh, no. It's half full. What should we do? Let's not stop. Just walk. Hey, Widya. Wait for me! What if I see something? Widya! Watch your words! Your big mouth caused this! Still, wait for me! You see him too, right? Then he's human. Not a ghost. Come on. Your motorcycle broke down? Yes, sir. Could you help us? -Thank you very much, sir. -You're welcome. Yes, sir. Just wait at our place. There's a party going on. Yes, sir. There's a party! Come on! Come on! A party, Widya! Come on! A party! Eat this. Control yourself! We're not exactly guests here. -Come on. Let's leave. -What? Leave. Now. They're not even done fixing the motorcycle. Your motorcycle is fixed. Sir. But just stay here for a while. Enjoy the food. Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. But I think we'll leave now. I haven't finished eating yet. Then, take some food with you. -Really? -Of course. There you go. Come on. Hurry up! Let's go. We're guests here. We could be banished. What were you thinking, Bima? How could you follow your lust? Sorry, Nur. We made a mistake. Now I believe what Anton said. He often hears a woman moaning from your room. What do you mean, Nur? Bima. Get up! Where's everyone else? I come with gifts. I thought you two got lost in the woods. Where's my snack? Our return journey was so exciting! Unforgettable for sure. Right, Widya? Come on, let's go in. Let's eat while I tell you all about it. Come on. Nur, Ayu, Bima? Have I got a story for you! Why so lifeless? Hey. I know. You all must be starving. What's the story, Wahyu? Listen. On the way back, in the middle of the woods our motorcycle suddenly broke down. But suddenly, an old man helped us. And he invited me and Widya to a party! I am so full. -Is there another village in the woods? -There is! Nonsense. There isn't! As far as I know, this is the only village in the middle of the woods. Mr. Prabu also said the same thing. Widya. But it was there, right? It was there, right, Widya? Widya, nod yes. Alright. Let's show them what I bring from the party. You'll see we're not talking nonsense. Where is it? You will believe me after. This isn't monkey's meat, right? Stop what you're doing, child. Widya? It'd be better for you not to get involved. Or else you will pay for it. I suggest you to stay out of it. Stay out of what? You don't need to know. I respect who is behind you right now. But I wouldn't hesitate to hurt you if you got involved. Do you understand, child? Bima? Bima. Time for morning prayer. I made a mistake, Nur. I had no choice. Did you really, Bima? I swear to God, I just realized it now. Don't include God's name in your mistake. That night... I had a dream. It felt so real. Widya. Widya! Widya! She won't be able to escape from the snake. Who are you? Call me Dawuh. Your friend is ensnared in the ancient ritual of this village. I can help her. If you do everything I tell you. What do I have to do? Go to Tapak Tilas. In the hut near the gamelan hall you will find this Bangle. Give it to your friend for her protection. This is the only way to save her. And every night you have to meet me. I will look after your friend. And if you do everything I say you will get what you want. Anything you want. That's my promise. Oh, my God. She's a jinn! How could you believe a jinn? Nur. I swear to God! At that time, I only thought about Widya. Your lust took control of you, Bima. Seek forgiveness. Forgive me, God. I caught you with Ayu yesterday. Who was the woman Anton heard in your room? I only remember Dawuh's temptations haunt me every night. Where is the Bangle now? I don't know, Nur. I'm afraid Widya is in danger. I also saw Widya with a snake in my dream. This must be a sign, Bima. I'm prepared to pay the price. Nur? Ayu? Anton? Bima? Nur? What are you doing? Pretty child. You like it here? So? Have you met Badarawuhi? Why are you crying, pretty child? Please don't cry. It's not good to cry. Even that handsome boy has met Badarawuhi. You don't know who I am, child? You think if I wasn't here your friends who cause disaster who are stupid enough to commit sins won't bring harm to my granddaughter? I won't let my granddaughter be harmed by anyone here. Do you understand, child? What do you mean by "harm", Mbah? Pretty child. Two of your friends will not stay alive if they don't stop committing sins. Listen to me. Tell them before they fall even deeper. They have crossed the line that will make the situation worse. They might cause harm to the whole village. Nur! Nur! I'm scared, Nur. I have failed to look after you, Widya. I failed. Tell me. What are you trying to do? Tell me everything now. I don't understand. What are you saying? In Widya's bag, I found the Bangle. I also found a green shawl in your bag. You put the Bangle inside Widya's bag, didn't you? Where did you get that shawl? You stepped over the line, Nur. Why were you going through my stuff? -That shawl is mine. -The Bangle is from Bima, isn't it? Bima got it after a dream. And do you know who was in his dream? She was a jinn, Ayu! Where did you get that shawl? From the same jinn! Come with me to Mr. Prabu's house. You have to tell him everything. Alright! Alright! I put the Bangle in Widya's bag. Not because Bima told me to. Then who? Bima did ask me to give it to Widya. But I didn't do it. And then a dancer came to me. She told me to give it to Widya. In exchange she gave me a green shawl that could make Bima fall for me. You're crazy! You made a deal with a jinn! Meet me at the house. I need to talk to all of you. Let's go home. Our extracurricular activities here ends tonight. Why? Why can't we finish it first? Ayu. Why are you crying? I know I made a mistake, Nur. But I'm begging you, Nur. We have to finish this extracurricular activities, Nur. -It's not fair to the others. -We all could be in grave danger, Bima. There's something wrong with this place. Why are you crying, Ayu? -You chose this place! -It's not this place's fault! It's our fault! So we're going back tomorrow, Nur? Bima! Bima! Bima? Bima? Bima? Bima? You're the Dawuh that I've been waiting for. I love your scent. Stay here, child. Stay here, child! Stay! Ayu. Wake up. Widya is gone. Ayu? Ayu. Ayu. Ayu! Ayu, wake up! Help! Help! What is it, Nur? What the hell? Widya is gone. And I found Ayu in this state! Let's get Mr. Prabu! -Where is Bima? Have you seen him? -I don't know. Ayu, wake up! Wake up, Ayu! Ayu! -Bring Mbah Buyut here now! -Yes, sir! Sir. There's something I need to tell you. Ayu and Bima had sex at Tapak Tilas. God, no. But Bima wasn't his normal self. They followed everything the jinn said. Her name is Dawuh. I know my friends made a mistake, sir. We made a mistake. But I'm begging you to save Bima and Ayu. You, stupid! Why didn't you tell us earlier? Damnit! How could they have sex here! That's enough! Your friends are in danger! Now! Everyone, search! Bima! Widya! Bima! Widya! Bima! Do you know what these are? Both belong to the Dancer... The Goddess of this village. Dawuh. Dawuh is not a name. That's the title given to the dancer. Her name is Badarawuhi. This Bangle can only be worn by the Dawuh that she has chosen. This green shawl is used to captivate anyone that she wants. What's going to happen with my friends? I'm begging you, please save them. Their souls are in Angkaramurka now. -Forgive us, God. -I can only hope she will let them go. Wait here. Slowly. Slowly, sir. Careful. Move. Careful. Slowly. Oh, God. Widya. Widya. Widya. I followed Bima, Nur. I saw him there with the dancer. They were surrounded by so many snakes. Ayu was there too. She was in tears. She was forced to dance. She was helpless. Stop. The souls of your friends are trapped in Angkaramurka. The snakes that you saw are the offspring of Bima and Badarawuhi. And Ayu has been made the new Dawuh. She has to keep dancing every inch of the land in these woods. They're punished for what they did. For that matter, I can't help you. I'm sorry, child. I have failed to protect them. A long time ago our ancestors believed that by sacrificing our daughters our village would be safe from misfortune. The gravestones covered in black cloth are graves of those who were sacrificed when this village was still under the devil's temptations. The gamelan hall at Tapak Tilas was a venue for dance performances. Not for our villagers but for the spirits that inhabit the village. I have failed to protect you all. It's my fault, sir. I have failed to keep your trust. It's my fault, sir. Nur. Let's go home. Goodbye, sir. That afternoon... I left the village with so much guilt. That won't go away even until today. BIMA DIED FOUR DAYS AFTER THEY RETURNED HOME AYU DIED THREE MONTHS LATER That was the last time I saw Mr. Prabu and Mbah Buyut. We... never went back there. I'm sure Ms. Nur has asked you the same to respect Bima and Ayu and their families... Please. Do not use our real names and do not reveal the name of that village. -Peace be upon you. -And upon you too. Kyai. Do you know that someone has been looking after me? Her name is Mbah Dok. She has been following you for a long time. I have asked her to leave you before. But she promised to look after you. In that village she really kept her promise. You must feel heavy sometimes in this area. That means that Mbah Dok is fighting the creatures that are trying to bother you. Peace be upon you.
