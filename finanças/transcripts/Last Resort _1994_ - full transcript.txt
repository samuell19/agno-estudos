Fries? Oh, yeah. Ooh, baby. Ah, baby, you look so good. The fries, Sam! Customers are waiting for the fries! Ohh! Sam, the fries! I want to suck your face. [Kissing] Damn it, carver. What the hell was that? Well, it looked like a French kiss to me. You keep out of this, you--you-- you weird-ass... Weird-ass... Punk. Punk! Carver, if you ever pull a stunt like that again, sticking your tongue in my mouth-- hey, there were no tongues involved. I'm a man, and you have a mustache. I'm telling you, you're going to be fired! I can guarantee you he will not kiss you anymore. That goes for you, too! I don't want to kiss you. You do not find me attractive? No. [Speaking Spanish] Will you speak English? For Pete's sakes, I don't understand you. [Coughing] Sambo...got to keep sabotaging our lives, right? Just do me a favor? Prewarn me. For the first time, I was out of this Detroit wasteland, and I was living in a beautiful, lush, tropical paradise. Paradise is in the emotions of the beholder. I'm getting a touchy-feely sensation. If you want to win in life, you got to go for the gold. Do the job. We need the money. Need money. I get that. Need money. [Choking] Ella esta--esta... Choking. Sam... Why'd you run away? Don't you like me? Like you? Whew! I love you. Come and get me...Sam. Get? You mean you? Come now? I've just left already. My body just... [Speaking Spanish] [Choking] Oh, yeah. Just keep rolling around. [Speaking Spanish] I'm coming, honey. On my way. Yes. I'm--I'm almost there. Oh, you look even more beautiful in person. Oh, that's--that's a great nipple. Sam! Sam! No! You look so good. I'm so glad to... I can't believe... This is...Just let me... Hold...I'll fix you. Oh, yes! [Ricochet] I'm in a parallel universe. What happened to my restaurant? It's beautiful, don't you think? It was so trendy! Trendy? Trendy? Come on! This was never trendy. Nobody even comes here. You two juvenile delinquents! Don't talk about our race like that, o.K.? I ought to--i ought to-- what? What are you going to do? I'm sick of your yelling, first of all. Secondly... Secondly... This is a disaster. Disaster. I think I speak for both of US... Both of US. When I say, we quit. We quit. Quit? How about fired? I'm going to the arcade, I'll hustle some punks, and I'll just beat them on chessmania 'cause I'm unbeatable. Let me tell you something about punks. Punks are what you are. You're going to go mess over some little kid, and what happens to punks like you is you get your control finger broken. We need the cash, cash, cash, cash-- would you please--shh-- don't do that. I hate when you do that. Why don't we just think about being creative for a change? What do creative people do? They do things like... We could join a circus. A circus? Get shot from a Cannon? Clean up elephant shit? Stop it! Sorry. You know what your problem is? You're tied too much to material things. Oh, material things? Material-- what material things? I'm going to get myself a computer, I'm going to break into a bank, and then I'll have some money. Move. I'm trying to watch my uncle Rex's movie. You've seen this 100 times. I love this movie. Still write this guy? No. Just do your thing, watch your movie, and I'll leave you alone. It's very important to me. This is my relative, for god sakes. Ha ha ha ha. Montgomery is ready to surrender, captain Morgan, sir! Because he knows he's been defeated. Send him in, Jack! Send him in! This is my favorite scene. At least you have the decency not to gloat, Morgan. It's captain Morgan, Montgomery. Captain Morgan? You're nothing but a scurvy buccaneer. Ahem. Well... Now that we've dispensed with the niceties, I have the terms of surrender. Sign it, Montgomery. You've not seen the last of me, Morgan. It's your turn, captain Morgan, sir. With pleasure. Conqueringly...yours. [Laughing] You dare spit upon me? The next liquid that comes from your body will be your blood! En garde! As I said, conqueringly yours... Montgomery. Not this time, carver. Hemlock, get out of my office. It won't be yours for long. I'm finally-- [hissing] [Voice echoes] I'm finally going to defeat you. You're behind on your mortgage, and the bank will foreclose. Well, I have a rather good relationship with the bank. I'm sure--ahem-- they'll extend me some credit. Really? Perhaps you don't know I bought controlling interest in the bank. Controlling... Interest in the bank. Oh! You blackguard! You blackguard! Leave me be, please. Oh, sorry, iguana. Did I frighten you? I'm such a bad boy. Not afraid of you. Is that parrot really talking? He's a ventriloquist. The offer still holds. I'll give you $500,000 for the island. This island is worth 12 million. Tough noogies. Good one, boss. I've waited years for this, carver. We have always been rivals from the old days in Hollywood, but I could act better, fight better, swash and buckle better... But the studios always made me the villain. You got the best parts. You got the best tables at the best restaurants, the best girls, the best... Social diseases, but now... I am playing the villain for real, and I will win. Soak up the view before I wrest the entire island from you, down to the last scuba tank. Wow. That was a really good speech, boss. Author, author. One of your best. Do you have a wastebasket around? Over there. Did you kill that iguana, boss? Enough! Treasure island will be mine, and you will lose. Ha ha! Heh heh! Excuse me, mister? Could I have your autograph for my mom? No problem. [Hemlock] Get out here! [Crash] Gino. Come on in. The door's open. I found them. They're in their apartment. Gino, your tracking abilities, just... They astound me. So you're obviously still working out, I can see. Yeah, yeah. I just, uh, I just came in 10th at the Mr. Universal contest. Are you still taking those steroids? Aw, you know I ain't got time to bulk up naturally. Forget about it. I'm too busy busting kneecaps. They're bad for your liver. We'll have to tell your mommy. No, not my mom, please. She'll kill me! Are you here on business or pleasure? Now, gino. Wh-wh-whoa! Why are you dancing? Why are you guys dancing? You're being evicted. What? What? You're being evicted! He paid his rent last week. I didn't get it. Kill them, gino. Like dying, you mean? Killing, dying, I don't want to! Oh, Mr. Dragsman, can't we just torture them a little bit? We only torture those we love. Gino, do what I say! Get them out! I'll tell my uncle! He wouldn't like th--aah! Aah! It's amazing. People bounce. [Groaning] Ow! Thank you. Hey! That's expensive, you know! No, don't! This is crazy. I know what I'm talking about. I know we paid the rent-- wrong. I remember it vividly. In the post office, I was walking behind this beautiful blond girl. She was amazing. She even gave me her phone number. Look. Let me see that. "555-4--" 555? They only use 555 in the movies! This chick is not real, o.K.? Of course! None of my chicks are real. [Coughing] Um, excuse me, brains. Yes? Dolt! It's on the back of the rent envelope! You never, ever mailed the rent. What are you talking about? Fine. So I never mailed it. Let's check the other mail. Junk mail, junk mail, junk mail. Letter. Junk mail, junk mail, junk mail, junk mail, junk mail, junk mail. Carver! My uncle Rex wrote me. Finally wrote you back. Yeah! He wants US to come to his place, treasure island, this amazing resort that he owns, and he wants US to work there as scuba instructors. Scuba man. It's a great game. I once got to the 12th level. Would you stop? I got eaten by a half-mermaid, half-shark. It was cool but disgusting. We don't know anything about scuba diving. Doesn't matter. We got to get there somehow because we have a whole island waiting for US. What? [Muttering] Oh, my god. It's one of those things. I am totally stoked. Hold on. This is amazing. Whoa! What? What the--where? Hey! Hey! It worked! We made it. We made it! So did our luggage! Ha ha ha! It's better than flying first class. This doesn't look anything like the brochure. Let me explain. The higher the level... Oh, god. Here he goes. The more green and the more lusher it gets. Why do you have to do that? God, come back down to earth! Cool. A turtle. What are you doing? A frog. A squirrel. What's wrong with you? A--a buick! [Car starts] A buick, right. Oh, my god. It's a buick. Oh...cool. [Jingling] Sam carver? Yes, you can call me that. A snail. I was waiting at the airport. How did you get here? Oh, we jumped through the sky. Two dogs doing it. Oh, well, I'm Sonja-- the official island goddess and your uncle's paid slave. You have fruit on your head. An aardvark. Kitty cat. Kitty, kitty, kitty. Come here! This is Sam, and I'm Dave. No. I'm Sam. This is Dave. W-We're brothers-- not really. You're a girl, right? Yeah. I'm Sonja, earth servant to the island Amazon goddess ya-ya. Ya...ya! Well, my name is... My name is... My name is... My name is... My name is... I forget who I am. I'm still Sonja. My synapses are buzzing. My pulse is racing. My sensors are shorting! My heart is throbbing! My joystick is moving! You guys, this scene is making me sick! [Loud island music plays] Will you turn down the music, please? Dave eisenhower. No relation whatsoever. I'm actually an anally compulsive cyberpunk searching for electronic bliss. I'm Sonja hiney. My hobbies are walking on the beach, watching sunsets, solving logarithmic computations, and developing a sensual parallel to the cartesian philosophical system. "I think, therefore I am," right? No, you're not. Eh-eh. You ever try virtual sex? It's like, you do it, but you're not actually there. Ooh, fascinating concept-- ultimate safe sex. Mm-hmm. Your uncle Rex wanted to see you. Walk this way. Take it easy, mon. Slow the plane down. * hi hi * hi hi... Yes. Flash MacKenzie at the treasure island resort lobby. One passenger pick up, wait at airport for second couple. Safe. Constant pain, a throbbing pain, boom, boom, boom, like hemorrhoids. Hemorrhoids don't boom. I should know. Who has worse hemorrhoids than me? Me! Someday we'll take a look. Here's the bus to the resort. Some resort. We should have gone to Miami. We live in Miami! Greetings. I'm flash MacKenzie. Call that a lining? You need a recharge, mama, and treasure island is the place for you. Climb on board. I'll take care of your luggage. Avast, me buckos. Aah! Guns n'roses! Far from it, honey. We're morgies. That a Jewish name? Hell, no. Where we come from in Texas, a Jew's about as rare as a pig fart in church. Morgies are fans of Morgan the pirate. We've seen all 20 of his movies. Hundreds of times. Yes, and we're here to meet our hero, Rex carver. I met liberace once! Yep. We've devoted our lives to Morgan the pirate. [Screaming] Oh, don't mind them. Tell that to my pacemaker. So, we're ready for the vacation of our lives, people? Oh, shoot the mophead, kids. Ah-ah-ah-ah, with the camera. We're not in Texas, remember? Oh, them smokin' too much weed, you know. I think it's the pesticides in the produce. Next time I'm pregnant, I'm only eating organic. Say, young feller, you're going backwards. It's the only gear working. This is beautiful. This is where our guests arrive. Oh, yeah. Nice. Trees. Very nice. Wonderful. Mm-hmm. Watch your step, all right? Flash. Flash. Yes, me darling. This is Sam carver, Rex's nephew, and his friend. Dave eisenhower. No relation, though. To who, mon? That's cool. How did you get the name flash? You see-- I already asked. You don't want to know. Howdy, youngsters. Don't stand like lumps! Shoot these people. Hi. Sam and Dave are scuba experts from Detroit. Detroit, huh? Right in the heart of scuba country. His office is this way. I can't wait. Oops. Sorry. Rex! Rex, it's Sonja. No. It's fruit. It's fake. Island goddess? Give me an apple. I'm here with your nephew. Just one little piece. Whoa, sorry. A little seasick. Rex, it's Sonja. I'm here with your nephew Sam. Hello? Hey, you touch me, and I'll bite your dick off. Ta-da! Ow! Eee! Avast, me hearties. Montgomery, I've been expecting you. No, Rex. It's me, Sonja, and your nephew Sam. Sam? Sam, your nephew? Ah, yes. I knew that. You know that. Know that Sammy! My old Sammy boy! Aah! Hi, sir. I'm not Sam. No, no. That's Sam. You're a little virtual pissed, ol' buddy. I knew that. Sammy, how are you? Oh! My, how you've grown. Actually... When was the last time we actually... Saw one another? Oh, that would be at least, what? 5...10...never. Oh. Oh, right, right. Well, I knew that. But you--I'm telling you, young man, I'm so proud of you. It isn't every man who can have a nephew who's a top agent with icm-- uh, fba--CIA. Excuse me? Top agent with the CIA? When did this happen, pal? You mean when did I tell him? Obviously I had to let him in on our little secret, you know-- the intense training in giuseppe Franco, the searching and trials and the teen america's-- getting them off drugs-- and the spy rings. You know what I mean. Oh. Oh. Wait, Rex. I get it. They're covering their cover. No. No. No. Actually, we're... Maintaining the truth, whatever that may be. Does that mean that you and... What's-his-name there are not with the CIA? Dave. The name's Dave, bub, all right? Dave bub. Ah. You know, secret agents really turn me on. Code name, storm shadow. So, in essence, you're bringing your nefarious talents over here to help me prick the boil on my backside of one Babcock hemlock. Wouldn't go as far as pricking. Well, I wouldn't go that far. Not his boils. Nope. No boils. So, carver has called in ci-- [deeper voice] So carver has called in CIA operatives to do me in. I want you to find out who they are. I'm not too crazy about messing with the CIA. I haven't been feeling good. I'm seeing a doctor tomorrow. You dare to disobey orders? Do what I want! Do--do what I want. It's time for the 10:00 torture rounds. I'm coming, my little pet. Aah! That was wonderful, Snuffy poo-poo. He's so strict. Yeah, but he does good work. That should hold her... Till noon. This place has some potential for tempt appeal. Tempt appeal? Are you kidding me? I'm in deep lust or love. It could be love. Seriously. In love. This place is pretty cool, huh? Pretty cool? Come on, Sam, we're here under false pretenses. What are you talking about? Hey, how's it going? We made up a little story, but it's uncle Rex's fault, not my fault. It's all those self-esteem tapes I'm listening to. He had everything, I had nothing, I had to tell him-- these people think we're something we're not. What do you mean? It's just part of the game. I'm glad you're both certified, because right now I'm the only dive instructor. Certified? I'm not certified. I'm just normally crazy. I love your wit. No, I mean certified, as in demonstrable, substantiated, validated. You are certified, aren't you? I can't believe you would ask that question. I'm sorry. Stupid me. If a Navy s.E.A.L. Isn't certified, who is? Navy s.E.A.L.? Navy s.E.A.L. Navy s.E.A.L.? Yeah. We're Navy s.E.A.L.S, right, Dave? Massaging the great truth again, Sam? Know what? I think Navy s.E.A.L.S are the perfect pinnacle of the male archetype. Is that good? Oh, my gosh, fantastic, wondrous, phenomenal, rare, unique, stupendous. O.k., everybody, get on the boat! The boat. The boat. Ladies. Ladies, hi. Uh... Welcome, ladies and beautiful ladies. Uh, I'm Sam... And this bouncy thing over here... Dave! I would like to welcome you to your first day of ski instructions... Uh, scuba instruction, and I'd like you to know that it's going to be very safe out there. We're going to have a big ride of diving. We're going to have a blast. Anyway, it's going to be a lot of fun. We're going to have, uh, great fun... Big, fat fun. Uh, aren't you guys forgetting something? Uh...we already went to the bathroom. We went. I mean your scuba gear. Put it on. Oh, scuba gear. Would you excuse me, darling? Here we go. Uh, got your tank? Tankage. That's a thermos. Of course. I want some coffee. I didn't know you guys are such jokers. O.k. All right. Get my gear on here. Y-You're joking, right? About what? It's on the wrong way. First things first. Got to check the valves. Let's get it on right. Everything looks o.K., though, just so you know. There you go. Do you need help? Huhhhh! No, we got it. We're under control. We're fine. We're in good shape now. You watched that? This journey will take 17 days. I'll be back on planet earth before you can say, "I'll be back on planet earth." Hey, hey, I'm good. A little foggy. Uh-oh. Aah! Oh, shit. He's flying. Aah! Help me! Aah! [Hissing] [Explosion] Wow. I landed in silicone valley. Oh. Are you two really Navy s.E.A.L.S? Uh, well... We can't answer that question. It's top-secret. Because this is no time to display typical male macho fronting. Are you experienced instructors or not? No. Yes. Which is it? Uh-oh. Hyperspace. Hyperspace! Here we go. Here we go. Mind scramble. Serious mind scramble! What's wrong with him? Nothing. Nothing. He just... It happens about this time every day. It's a praying thing. Religion. What'd we come here for, anyway? We needed a vacation. We're always on vacation. We're old. I figured maybe here we could become inspired. Inspired. For what? To make love. We already did that. Sure. In 1979. All the students who wanted to learn to scuba dive left for brisco island. I thought Rex's friend and Rex's nephew and his friend was going to teach them. Man, they can barely swim. I don't know why Rex thought they could help him. Unless... Unless what? Unless it's all part of their cover-up. The total Peter Pan syndrome. You know, you're probably right. Psst! Hey! Look, the captain's about to make his entrance. O.k. [Bell clangs] Aha! Avast, me hearties! [Bell clangs] As I was saying, avast, me hearties. And what have we here? A whole family of morgies. Aah! Hey, Rex. We've seen all your movies over 100 times. Is that all? Not enough? We can see them again if you want. It's not necessary. Enjoy yourselves. And what is this here? Oh, the blush of ageless love, yearning to be cut free to feel once again the sweetness of cupid's arrows? No, sir. We're married. Oh... Well...no matter. Treasure island will stir the pot of your passion once again. Well, eat, drink, be merry. People can still call me macho, but I love this outfit. Oh! Look at these beautiful ladies. My sister and I are here on vacation, and we're on the scavenger hunt. We need just one more item-- a picture of two CIA agents. I guess you're in luck because... We happen to be two CIA agents. No! I can't believe it. Yes, darlings... Aah! You dames interested in the total Jamaican experience? But we are not in Jamaica. I'm interested in the experience. Will you knock it off? We got pictures to get for the scavenger hunt. Now, knock it off. I'm sorry. You've done such a good job. Give me the film. Go suck a dead egg. Now, children, they need this film for their scavenger hunt, so give it up. Scavenge this, man. You got problems, kid. Jump in the pool. Avast and avaunt. What's going on here? Well-- these two want our film. Give these two poor excuses for wenches whatever they want, you scalawags. Thank you. Thank you. Can I have your autograph for my mommy? Come to my quarters later. [Hemlock] That's enough, you two. Get back--now. How does he do that? Is this a private aerobics class, or can anybody sweat here? It's not an aerobics class. I happen to be performing a night dance to the goddess ya-ya. Care to join me? Of course. Where can I find a treasure? I hope you and Sam know what you're doing, 'cause we really, really need the help. We do. We know what we're doing. I'm positive of it. That's why I called you here. To tell me that. No, no. Because you are CIA. You're a Navy s.E.A.L. And Rex can't make his next payment. Aha. I get the plot. And I have the solution. We can use some of your diving tricks to locate the treasure to save my island. Take the money the resort makes, and pay it off. But we're not making any money. Sam, I want you to start diving tomorrow for the treasure. He'll probably lose the island, the poor man. He's nurtured all my goddess fantasies. Um, I know that you're thinking you don't want me to do that because I'd pollute the ocean. There's laws against this stuff. The ozone layer... You know, I'd give anything to save this resort. Anything? Sam, Sam, my dear fellow, have you ever heard of a film called the family of Morgan the pirate? One of yours. Yes. Excel--a masterpiece. I'd give up my Amazon to become... The Madonna and whore to do that. How about a free sample? My favorite scene was when you made your brother walk the plank. Just...right there. Bingo. Boom! Boom! Boom! You're only a nephew. Boom! Uncle Rex, did I mention how much I love diving? The deal is, we got to look for this buried treasure. I know what you're saying, but you're crazy. I'm not crazy, o.K.? My uncle Rex says it's the only way we'll save the island. Your uncle Rex is from another universe. He's crazy. We got to do this. If we don't look for the treasure, he'll make US walk the plank. Sam, man, that's movie stuff. Dave, this is a movie. I'm off to the shrine of ya-ya. Would you like to join me? We'd love to, but we have to go Bury...look... Treasures. Look for buried treasure. It's a new challenge-- real-life games. I love it. I want it. You're so brave. Everybody says there's a treasure, but no one knows for sure. That's why we're going. I want to save the school and the island for you and for good old uncle Rex. I vow this with every bone in my body, with every fiber of my being, every neuron of my brain, every suit in my closet, or my name isn't... My name isn't-- what's his name? Dave. Yeah. Or my name isn't Dave. My hero. Forget ya-ya. You're the only ya-ya I want. Don't blow it. Great kiss. Whew! Let's go. Whoo! * one day * I was walking * through the woods * by and by * down there * by a river * in the grass * I saw your eyes * then * your pretty red dress * brought a smile * to my eyes * then you * called out my name... [Gasping] [Gasping] I'll have to check my calendar. I'll have to check my calendar. O.k. T-minus 10... 9, 8, 7... 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, zero. Ignition... Liftoff. Aah! What? Whoa! Hey, Sammy, here we come! Double bubble! Perfect landing. Ow! All right, o.K., who are you guys really? I'm Sam, and this is what's-his-name. Code name, storm shadow. No, no. Code name, b.S. Ya-ya was right. I should've listened. You talked to ya-ya? I'm one of her priestesses. She talks to me all the time. You aren't CIA or Navy s.E.A.L.S, are you? Yes. No. No. Yes. Oh, ya-ya, please forgive me for disbelieving you. They are impostors, frauds. You know what? I thought you were a special person. I thought you were the person I've waited for all my life. You're just like all those other phony CIA guys I dated. I'm not like those phony CIA guys you dated. I'm a regular phony guy. Wait, Sonja. I'm kidding. Come back. Hey, what's wrong with you, man? There's other fish in the ocean. Look, Sam, this girl does something special to me. Do you understand? I'm going to do something to help this island. Dave, there's something wrong with you. You're normalizing on me, pal. Well, I feel, uh... I feel calm. You're not the weirdo I came here with. Are you in with this? Yeah, but first I'm going to be with her. Because there's a fin with breasts-- Sam, this is important. So is this. This is very important. You know, there's a mermaid here. Excuse me, but did you ever wonder where you put it? I have to find that out. I don't care if it's the last of its species. Exterminate it. It's probably lonely, anyway. Snuffy, how do I spell "exterminate"? E-x-t-e-r-m-i-n-a-t-e. What did you want? The doctor says I have a yeast infection. Dummkopf! The CIA agents. Have you located them yet? Jawohl, herr kommandant. We have photos. How do you spell "dummkopf"? D-o-o-m-k-o-f-f. This one here is the one they call Sam. Ooh, he's cute. Shh! Not so cute. Very clever. He's disguised as a grown slob. And this is the other one, boss. They call him what's-his-name. Ooh, he's cute. Shut up! Not cute. These agents are quite good. This one's posing as a cyberpunk. An excellent cover. Whoops. That shouldn't be there. I want you to get rid of them. But, boss, CIA agents, they're tough. They're crafty, cold, and they're cruel! You dare disobey my orders? [Cracking] You're talking about cruelty? Your orders are our commands, herr kommandant! Oh, Snuffy, want me to help you readjust your hand? Ooh. [Crunch] Ahh. All right. Say it. Say what? You're sorry you married me. I'm not sorry. Then what are you, disappointed, regretful, annoyed, angry? All of the above. I got some ass! You know, there aren't many mermaids in Detroit. That's because it's really not mermaid season. Yeah, well, I have to agree with you there. Listen. What's this? Will you listen? Now, listen. When he comes over, boom! You hit him over the head. Got it? Right on the head. Gotcha. Hide. Get back there. Phone call for Sam carver! Phone call for Sam carver! Hear that? That's me. I'm very popular. Hold this. I'll be right back. Wait right there. Just keep your fin wet. Hi. I'm Sam carver. The phone is for you, sir. Hit him! Ow! Hello? Hello? Nobody-- the phone's for you. Oh, thanks a lot. Sure. Hello? Aah! Ohh! Ohh! Jeez, you killed him! Great! Don't tell mom. Ohh. Ooh. Oh, fish. Fish sandwich. You bumbling oaf. I gave you a job, and you failed. We can't go back to the post office. I promise we'll do it right. Cross your heart and hope to die? Want a bite? I'm a vegetarian. Until you find Rob, I'll have to send in my special operative-- the annihilator. Do you want to go down in treasure island history as a no-good, yellow-bellied, fake CIA scum, swine bag? That sounds pretty good. What are you guys doing now? He's leaving. [Suspense-movie music plays] Hey. What? Listen to that soundtrack. Something's going to happen. There's nothing here for me. I don't like anything about this place. [Mermaid] Oh, please, let me out. Help me. Except her. Hi. Hi. I'm Alex Cole. You are. Alex Cole. That's amazing, actually, because you have a boy's name inside a woman's body. I'm looking for Sam carver. So am I. Sam... Sam car--Sam c-car-- that's me. You're looking for me. She's looking for me. Doesn't that mean anything to you? This is... You're a legend. I'm a legend? I've been waiting to meet you. Yeah. Me, of all things. Can't we go somewhere a little more private? Private? Like what would you have in mind? Like, I don't know. Your pants. My pa--my poo-- my what? These pants? Those pants back there... [Mermaid] Help me! Help! Sonja, wait. Talk to me. Come on. It's Dave. Dave the CIA agent and Navy s.E.A.L.? He's not here anymore. I'm sorry. It's not my fault. I didn't know Sam was writing lies to his uncle. Which you reinforced with your collusion. Yeah. It was just to please you, though. Look, ever since I met you, I felt...Grounded, you know? Grounded... For the first time in my life. Please, don't leave me, all right? I've got work to do. Hyper bummer. You knew what I was like. You said you liked the strong, silent type. That was before. Before what? Before I knew how dull it was. [Burping] Love your decor. Can I, uh, get you something? I never knew treasure island had such sexy men. It doesn't really have sexy men. You're the kind of man I could spend the rest of my life with. So are you. Do you find me attractive? Is the pope Jewish? Let's get started with the rest of our lives. First I have some business. Business? What kind of business? I'm here on official business for my boss... Babcock... Hemlock? [Thunder] Name sounds familiar. He wants to become a partner with your uncle. Uncle Rex hates him. He's a villain. Your uncle's mistaken. He's mistaken about lots of things, if you know what I mean. Well, he does act a little strange sometimes, but... Mr. Hemlock... [Thunder] Wants to buy into the island. Uh, well, see, I don't think that's going to happen. My uncle feels very strongly about this. But he won't keep the island unless he has the money. Do you think you can get Rex to change his mind for little old me? I don't know what we can do. Too bad, then. He'll lose the whole place and be floating homelessly afloat in the ocean. I wouldn't want that to happen. You just have to get him to sign his contract. He'd have more than enough money to pay for his mortgage. Rex would be happy. Mr. Hemlock... [Thunder] He'd be happy. I'd be happy. And I could make you happy tonight. Couldn't we skip all those other happys and get to me being happy right now? And I don't wear any underwear. Mmrrreow. Uncle Rex. Jack, what are you doing here? I'm your nephew Sam. Don't play games with me, Jack. Is Montgomery ready to surrender? Oh, I get it. O.K. Uh, well, uh, I'm not Montgomery-- don't contradict me. Get that fellow in here so we can sign the terms of the surrender. Yes... Aye, sir! We'll bring in the scalawag, rat that he is. Oh, ho ho ho! All that stuff. Good. Hop to it. Ah-choo. Sam, did you get the contract signed? Uh, contract. No. Um, no. As a matter of fact, I didn't because it was really difficult. I couldn't get Rex-- my uncle--to--to-- I went to say, "hello, can you do this?" And he was like in left field. He didn't even recognize me. It was very embarrassing. Did I mention I don't wear any underwear? No, you didn't mention that, but now that you have... And who might ye be, curvaceous wench? I am the daughter of the king, and your head will roll when he finds you have abducted me. Ho ho! I like fire in a wench. Unhand me, you filthy beast. Oh, but can a beast kiss like this? Ooh! Some men know about romance, Irv. Are you saying I don't know about romance? You never spoke when we made love. You never were awake when we made love. Dave. I need a mood enhancer. Hey, come on. Sonja hates me. No, she doesn't. I have a plan. It's actually Alex's plan. This guy wants to buy into the island. Good for him. It is good for him. It's even better for US. It's good for you and me and Sonja, actually. It'll make her happy. If she's happy, I'll be happy. If I'm happy, Alex is happy. If Alex is happy, guess who will be happy. Um...who? You! Yes! You are! Yeah-yeah. Yeah. Yeah-yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Whoo hoo! Montgomery is ready to surrender, captain Morgan, sir. He's finally realized that he's been defeated, eh? Well, bring him in, Jack. Bring him in. I-- at least you have the decency not to gloat. At last you have the decency of a goat, Morgan. Captain Morgan to you, Montgomery. Captain? You call yourself a captain? You're nothing but a scurvy buccaneer. Captain? You call yourself a captain? You're nothing but a scurvy sucking beer. Buccaneer. Buccaneer! Buccaneer. Buccaneer. Buc-- buccaneer. What do you say that we pay attention now to the surrender? [Grunting] Sign it, Montgomery. Uh, your turn. With pleasure. Conqueringly yours. Ha ha ha ha. You haven't seen the last of me. You haven't seen the last time I peed. Oh, wait. Wait. Haven't you forgotten something? [Grunts] Spit on him. Spit on you! Spit on him. Spit on him. How dare you spit upon me. Next liquid that comes out of your body will be your own blood. My what? Take this sword and defend yourself. Oh, but-- en garde! Aah! Oh! Aah! Aah! Put your fingers down. You already did that in lost boys. Take the sword. All right. Go, go, go. Ah ha ha! Ah ho ho. [Whooping] You've been practicing. Waaa! Ooh, that was nice. Ha ha! Aah! I accept your surrender. Take him away. Yes, sir. Aye, aye, captain. Make sure makeup cleans up that spittle. He tried to kill me. He tried to kill me. He tried to kill me. You did the right thing. You really think we did the right thing? I think we did the right thing. Let's think about it for a second. Sonja's going to be happy, right? The ya-ya god's going to be happy. You're going to get a lot of ya-ya sex. Alex is going to be happy, which means I'm going to get lots of ya-ya sex, and Rex is going to have a lot of money because he did the right thing. We ended up making lots of sex and money. Yee yee yee yee yee. You what? It's great. Rex will have money to pay his debts. Excuse me for a minute, ya-ya. Hemlock has been trying to buy a piece of this island for years. You gave it to him. I can't believe Rex signed that agreement. He did. Maybe it's not so bad. How did you get him to sign it? Sam and I convinced him. Convinced him? How did you convince him? We just, you know... What? We just... We tricked him. Tricked? That is the most negative, bad karmic, repressive, ugly, unspiritual, abusive, ugly-- you already said ugly. Disgusting thing to do. Oh. This calls for the big shrine. I've got some industrial-strength praying to do. So I guess this means fooling around with a tub of cool whip is out of the question? You happy? Mmm, yeah. Very. Good. I hope I did the right thing. You really are a soft guy. Come up into my room now. * I can walk her to her room now * ya-ya, babes, talk to me here. We've never really talked, but I need your help. I like her. I want her. I need her. It's that simple, so do me a favor and just hear me. Ya-ya, please, ya-ya. Please to give me woman. It's amazing. When you dance, it's not like somebody dancing. [Wheezing] It's more like somebody actually crawling into a dance, is what it is. It's different than anything I've ever seen before. I'm not excited or anything-- I'm lying. I'm so excited. You don't even know. My room's over here. This would be the way to walk to-- her room. That's where we're going. Oh, we're almost there. Beds is what's in her room. Why are you walking so slow? I'm just tired. There's beds with pillows and things. This is my room. And--and this is her room. Amazing. This is good night. This is good night. Good night! What do you mean, good night? Wait, wait. Hold everything. What--what about dinner and eating and underwear and eating underwear? Sam, if I let you into my room now, with all the satin sheets spread with love oil, you'd think I'd slept with you for the contract. Yeah. No. No. No, I wouldn't. No. No. No, I wouldn't. You'd think badly of me. No, I wouldn't. You won't respect me in the morning. No, I wouldn't. No-- yes. Yes, yes. I would. As a matter of fact, I would. I'd actually respect you more. I can't take that chance. You mean too much to me. Good night, Sam. Good night, Sam? A kiss on the nose? I gave her an island! Signed, sealed, and delivered. I got to leave. I have a show tonight in St. Martin. You would like to see what your present performance has brought me? What? Treasure island, hemlock style. [Screaming] Can I just have my money? When Rex carver incurs a certain death, which he will, this contract will allow me to step in and protect our investment. Very cute plot. Just pay up. What is this? My agent told me it was 10,000 plus expenses. I, uh, took the Liberty of rewriting your contract. I'm going to report you to the union. Now for phase two. Uh! Ugh! I got aqua lung! Ugh! Let's get this-- get the hammer. Give me the hammer. [Snoring] Shh. [Snoring] You're in a dream. On the isle of lesbos, beautiful women are coming to welcome you. Sleep. Sleep. [Computer beeps] Get the wire. Get the wire. Hee hee hee hee! Iraqi? Bomb? [Screaming] Get out of here! No. No, no! Rex. Rex, look. All the flights to the island have been canceled. I need the revenue to pay the mortgage. No one's going to come to the island Amazon goddess festival. She's going to be so pissed. Who? Who? Ya-ya. No, no. Yeah, yeah. Aah! Ah! Ah! Oh! Need a personal injury attorney? Interested in suing treasure island for big bucks? Contact Rob and Bob job. We'll give you everything that's yours. We give everyone... The job job! Hey, here's another one. Need a personal injury attorney? We give everybody the job job! Look, there's an old lady. Hit her! I'll never come back to this shithole again. Bye. See you later. I don't believe this. We just lost another week's worth of receipts. Ju-ju. What's ju-ju? Never mind. Ju-ju beans-- exactly. This is horrible. What are you so worried about? We're going to get some money from that deal we just signed with Babcock. Like he'll do that. [Dramatic music] No, he is. Listen to the soundtrack. I've got an idea. Give me the bat phone. Who are you going to call? I will send the money today. Uh, no problem whatsoever. Going, boss? Going exactly as planned. Isn't that wonderful, Adolph? I'll send the money, then they'll be leveraged to the hilt. Ha ha ha ha! You're tickling me, Angeline. Ha ha! Stop it! Oh! I'm sorry, Adolph. You don't want to come? There's no way, huh? Did I mention there's a nude beach here? We've got vibrating beds, porno movies, a sexual aid shop. You got to come, you got to come, you got to come, you got to come... To treasure island. Yes, baby girl, me long, strong, and hung like king Kong. Vaginas? Did I mention those? Everyone's coming. Excuse me! Hey, a customer, and he's a dork-man. Which one of you is Sonja hi... Hiney? Take a wild guess, pal. Him. You're half right. What is it? I'm authorized to give you a check for $300,000 to cover expenses and losses according to paragraph "c," section 8, subsection 4-l of your contract with Babcock hemlock. That's great. Oh, my gosh. Thank you. This is fantastic. Thank you, Mr. Dork-man. Bye, Mr. Dork-man. Guys, with this money, we'll rent a jetliner, pick up all the stranded people in Miami. We'll get two weeks' worth of supplies, fix up the rooms, and get ready for the influx of people. How about an autograph? Of course. Hello. Conqueringly yours... Now, this is more like it. I've never seen Rex happier. Yeah, but are you happy? Yes. Very happy, but I think we judged hemlock too quickly. How could you ever forgive me? What do you have in mind? I don't know. Something really special. Sam carver, Sonja hiney, and what's his name? The name's Dave, bub. Listen up, people. Under section 4, subsection "c", paragraph 12, line 5, word 4, subword 2 of the agreement, the right to protect the investment is hereby invoked by hemlock. I don't like the sound of that. What does it mean? He's taking control of the island. "Borrowing from a partner is subject to 62% interest, payable within 72 hours." We're screwed. We're big-time screwed. I knew it. I told you, but no, you wouldn't listen. You've ruined Rex's life, not to mention putting a cramp into mine. Well, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to the crying shrine. She took that rather well. Sam, did you read those contracts? Yeah. It didn't say anything about Sonja. Did it say anything about US getting screwed? No. Alex and I talked about that, and she said nothing about screwing. Tell your uncle Rex the truth. Oh, the truth. I get it. From now on, from this day forth, from this moment on, I vow to be honest in all my affairs. Throughout the kingdom, throughout the land, to give forth honesty with every breath, I... Vow... To be the most honest man in the world. [Applause] Hyper-pukage. Thank you. [Lip-synching to singing in Italian] Uncle Rex, I have something to talk to you about. Well, what seems to be the problem, boy? The problem seems to be, uncle Rex, that I betrayed a trust. I tricked you into signing an agreement with Babcock hemlock. [Thunder] Oh, shit. His intentions were purely good. He was only trying to help you. Because of me, well, you basically lost the island. What's going to happen to me? I know you like parrot burgers. Up, up, up. I knew that. You always say you knew that. You didn't know it. I am not what people think I am. You're not? What are you? Most people think I am a crazed fool, living in the past. I've been watching your life, Sam, and you are a failure, along with your friend, uh, what's-his-name. Dave, bub. Dave bub. I asked you here to give you a chance to make something of your lives, to seize the opportunity and help me save my island. Well, listen-- we're not Navy s.E.A.L.S or CIA agents. But you do have courage. They don't. Yes, they do. We'll go with the parrot, then. Find me a loophole. I don't know. We got to find a loophole. Isn't a loop and a hole the same thing? Look, look! There's something-- never mind. Find anything? Wait. Seriously? No. [Knock on door] Hi. Get out of my dream. Shh. Does that happen in your dreams? Yeah. What'd you come back here for? You wanted to ruin my life some more. You thought you'd rub it in? No, to help. If there's a way you can help out, I have someone you could talk to. [Bell rings] [Coughing] [Sam] If you stopped choking her, you'd be able to hear her better. I was just trying to do my job. Thanks to your performance, you ruined Rex's life. There is an option to buy back the island. You have to come up with the money before the out clause expires. How much? The remainder of the mortgage payments-- 3.5 million. $3 million? That's, uh, 3.5 million. Where are we going to get $3 million? The buried treasure. Where do we find a buried treasure? Ahoy. Ahoy. I'll show you. You know where it is? Ha ha ha ha! My faithful crew, tomorrow we go digging for the treasure. Uh, uncle Rex? Rex? I'm not your uncle Rex. I'm Morgan the pirate, you fog-nose. There is no treasure, mon. That's because no one's dug in the right place, but I know where it is, because me and me mateys buried it there. Looks like-- it looks like Mr. Carver is going to search for the fabled treasure island treasure. Everybody talks about the treasure. It don't exist. I also have a map. Oh, joy, they have a map! So tomorrow we'll dig it up, and we'll divvy up the spoils. As you can see, the treasure's on the island. It's buried here, right behind the-- something's happened to the bug. Now we're never going to find the treasure. Legend has it that it had pretty necklaces and pearls. [Sucking] Nuts. It's empty. Go to sleep now, me mateys. Tomorrow will be a big day. Good night, Rex. Good night. [Choking] Ow! Ow! Wait a second. What's wrong with this picture? Where's Sam? After last night... He couldn't--he couldn't get up this morning. Oh, you gold girl. O.k., the map says we start at, uh, the rock of wisdom. I know where that is. Let's go. [Sonja] Yay! * why * why * why does it happen? * when I'm talkin', you don't even listen * * and if you're speakin', you don't ask opinions * * we can see these problems as one, now * Watch your step here. There's the rock. Let's go. Here it is-- the rock of wisdom. What's so wise about it? Well, knock on it. Read the national lampoon. It's a kid. Rocks don't age. Let me try. Go back to acting school. My turn. Always wear a condom. I always do. You haven't gotten laid in months. Why, I ought to... The map says go due north 300 steps to wild palms. That way. Good luck, and watch out for snakes. [Sonja] 26... 27... 28... 29... 30...31... 291, 292, 293, 294, 295... 298, 299, 300. Well, here it is-- wild palm. How would you know? Ha ha ha ha! See? The map says go 50 yards south by southwest or until you meet the old hermit. That way. What is this, a safari? All right. Ha ha ha ha! What now? Beats me. You looking for that stupid treasure? You know where it is? I'm the old hermit. I know everything, and I wish you people would leave me alone. Never stops. Day and night. Treasure this, treasure that. Can we just get the treasure, please? First you have to pass the three tests of valor. I'm no good at pop quizzes. You have to prove you're warriors worthy of the treasure. Well, we're worthy, right? Is this an individual or a group attempt? Group. Group. You give a group discount? What do you want, you sniveling toad sniffer? Old man, we got here first, o.K.? Never mind. They're here, they're entitled. Let's get started. Take your places! [Ring] Hello? Hello? Hello? Sam. What are you doing, man? Wake up. What? I need you here. Oh, god. All right. This is Ricky tic tic, your announcer for this game show. Welcome to the exciting new version of three tests of valor. We have two exciting teams competing today. Team "a." Let's give them a hand. And team "b." Aren't they wonderful? Boo! Sss! You know how the game's played. We'll get started. There are three rounds-- mental, physical, and spiritual. We'll start with the physical round-- tag team ballroom dancing. I'm good at that. We'll start with the tango. [Dave] Very good. Music, maestro, please. [Tango music plays] Aren't they wonderful? Look at the rhythm, the style, the finesse. [Dave] Faggots! They know what they're doing. This is not their first time out. [Dave] Ooh, hello. You go, boy! Go, boy. These two have definite flair. [Flash] Come on, Sam. Dance, mon, yes. Whoo! Such grace, such power. [Dave] Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah! And now the mambo. [Mambo music plays] Everybody's favorite. Obviously multitalented. [Dave] Stop it right now. I can't take it anymore. They don't do this just for fun. Aah! Oh! Everything for the show. [Sam] Go, boy! Smiling, dancing, happy. Who could ask for anything more? And finally, the cha cha cha. [Music plays] Get loose. Get funky with it now. The seduction of the cha cha cha. Yes, mon. Yes, mon. Brings out the beast in all of US. The true taste of the islands. And now the winners. Team "a"... Oh, yes. It is US, folks. Let's hear the judges. Or team "b." Come on. You can do better than that. What do the judges say? Team "b" wins. Yay! Yay! Let's hear it for team "b." And now we move to the mental round. It's a little riddle. Ooh, I love little riddles. Here's the riddle. Tom's mother had three children. She named one penny. She named the other nickel. What did she name the third? Quarter! Dime. Half dollar! George Washington. Well, his picture's on the dollar bill. You're all wrong. Tom! [Bell rings] His name is Tom! Right. When I began the riddle, I said "Tom's mother." One for this side and one for that side. What an exciting game! And now for round three and the tie-breaker-- the test of spirituality. The test of spirituality determines who is the worthiest of men. Put that tongue away, honey. Oh, let's see how they measure up. Could be a tough one to call. You never know by looking at one's face. Aha. Seems a little nervous. Not a bit of nerve there. Hmm... Want to see it all or just enough to win? He makes US all nervous. Oh, my god. We know who the winner is. Oh, ladies and gentlemen, even our seasoned judge was struck by that one. The winner--"a" team. All right. Let's hear it for the "a" team. You have passed the test of... Whatever they're called. Where's the treasure? Oh, that. It's on the beach by the boats. This is Ricky tic tic, reminding you to join US every week... That treasure will be mine. Hey, you can't do that. They won fair and square. Shut up. You're all winners here at three tests of valor. You know, it's amazing. We have walked by this place every day for the last week. I've not once noticed a sign that says "treasure here." That's it. Morgan the pirate's treasure. Open it! Open it! Not so fast, hemlock. Carver! Attack, me mateys! Just like old times, carver, only this time it's for real. You, you married? No. A nice boy like you? I could help you here. Go away! Just fight, o.K.? And you shut up. Hey, you, watch your mouth. Ooh! I've beat you in the films, and I'll beat you in life. We'll see about that, my friend. Ya! Ya! Ya! Ya! Aah! Hey, can't we all just get along? Come here, big boy. Ya!ya! There ain't nobody around here to fight. How about each other? Hey, I like that idea. 'Round and around we go. Have you called your mother? I forget. What kind of son are you? I'm a bad boy! I want my mommy! I love you, mommy. Don't hit me, mommy! Oh, mommy! I'm sorry, mommy! Aah! How about a Mai Tai? Thrust and parry. Is that all you got to say? Well, look behind you. Sure. I'll fall for that old trick. Yeah. You're too stupid. Fine! Aah! Wait. Um... Get him, boss! Conqueringly yours, carver. Somebody do something! He's going to kill Rex! That's the advantage of being a villain-- you stay in shape. You haven't dealt with me yet, scumbag. You little pipsqueak. I'll carve you into strawberry pie. Oh, that's-a my favorite, boss. With or without whipped cream? With. Aah! I got you. I got you. I got you. Come on. He's yours, Sam! He's yours! Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Yay, yay! O.k. All right. Ha! Aha! You're next, bullet head. How dare you think you can best the great Babcock hemlock, king of the hill, master of all I survey. [Voice changing] I am--i am--i am-- i--i--i--i--i--i-- [high squeaky voice] I am the meanest son of a bitch in all the world. Some villain. What a joke. What did you do? It's technology. Deal with it, old man. I can't be a villain with a voice like this. [Sobbing] Very good, lads. Now let's open the treasure and pay this fellow what we owe him. [Crying] Huh? Hey, there's nothing but cans of film in here. Is that a fact? Something called ace of the skies. Ace of the skies? The only existing copy of the film in which you starred. The only movie in which you played the hero. I--i thought it was lost in the studio fire. Ha ha ha! Not this one. I must have it. I must have it! You may have it... On the condition that you pay the mortgage. Do it. I agree. I agree. Movie night! Movie night! Movie night! Let's go! Come on! Treasure island is now the property of Rex carver. Ha ha ha! Thank you all! Thank you. I am most grateful to all of my wonderful guests. This vacation has really changed everybody's lives. But never forget, friends, that your own individuality are the most treasured part of your lives. You were right, Rex. You know, it's better for US to live our own lives than to Bury them in old movies. Oh, that's good. Oh... Ah. And our senior citizens have learned something, too, haven't they? Yes, well...So, Sam, I guess you'll be going back to Detroit now. Uh, no, not at all. Actually, uncle Rex, I thought I'd like to stay and work with you. Done. And what about... What's-his-name? Dave. Well, uncle Rex, I want to stay and try to have as many babies as possible. Oh, did you know that ya-ya is the goddess of fertility? Those are all good choices. And... As the great Morgan the pirate once said, all's well that ends well. Uncle-- uncle Rex, that--that-- that would be Shakespeare, actually, who said that. I know that. Remember, lads, we are fighting for the glory of england! We fly against the hun to drive them back from whence they came, for good, forever, for the love of country. Tally-ho, cheerio, good luck, and... Good flying! I was good, wasn't I? Damn good, boss. This is beautiful, boss. You're giving a very sensitive and soulful performance. You look so derriere.
