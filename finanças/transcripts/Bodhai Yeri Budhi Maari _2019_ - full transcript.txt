Title: BODHAI YERI BUDHI MAARI (Under the influence of drug) Greetings, to one and all present here Today, is our day! 26th of June... Anti-drugs day! Instead of being embarrassed about the few tragedies in our lives... and if we share it among ourselves, we'll be relieved of our pains and burdens First up, Mr. Krishna First up, Mr. Krishna I'm a chartered accountant A good job A beautiful wife An angel like daughter But we wanted more kids Well, she had Only the first child was sired by me Yes! She is not with me anymore Our dreams are shattered I became a drug addict She begged and pleaded me to give it up But I couldn't I became incapable She is just 26 years old She is just 26 years old She suffered a lot Finally... she made her up mind that she would be better off without me And now... I am unable to face her Now, Nisha will share her experience with us It hurts me to find myself in such a place Yet all your love makes me happy I lived my life in a wrong way I have no one to talk to me I keep staring at the walls of my room... I keep staring at the walls of my room... and I do it all day long I have a big family Not mine anymore My own elder brother... My own elder brother... threw me out... and he called me a prostitute Let's promise Nisha that we'll lend our moral support To make this day even special, we have a guest today in our center He is Mr. Karthik His wife is Mrs. Janani And he has two little daughters So, let's welcome Mr. Karthik Hi everybody Don't. Use. Drugs! Initially we consume these drugs as stress buster but after a point it bursts up our lives This is the story of most of your lives, who are sitting here But the story of my life... isn't a cliched ordinary story Life is very beautiful Life is very beautiful But, in reality, the drugs we consume prevents us from living our beautiful lives My reality is a lost cause My family, mom, dad, my sister, Janani, friends... all of them were pretty much with me The next step in life was marriage And it was all beautifully set up for me Three years ago... One fine day... How many of them are there? - One, two, three... - Including the labors who are digging out there... - I'm talking about 'Nalangu' custom - Oh I see - Keeps talking nonsense - Ok, fine Why is she afraid of you? What did you do? I didn't intimidate her too much Whenever I go to meet my friends... it's only during that time I talk to her If you had just had casually spoke to her... then why is she going to the extent of rejecting you? I don't know No one told me anything about it I ain't also forcing her for this wedding or that I want her! It's mom, who wants to resume ties and ensure it is strong with their family It doesn't look me like you agreed to this for mom's sake She is as beautiful as Alia Bhatt... and looks like you fell for her I don't want him! Look, they are the best family among our relatives Gayathri is a gem Other families act according to their need But this family? They are always the same After marriage they will take care of very well I hate this! I hate this Nalangu! I hate it when you fake a smile and invite people for the wedding! Dad's spending all the money unnecessarily. I hate it all! Girls who talk like you end up having two children after the first year of marriage Mom, keep forcing me like this and I'll run away! I'll break your legs! Then how will you run away? Listen dear! You better live up to that fear! Mom... my curses will get you someday! Get lost! Dear, keep this bag.
