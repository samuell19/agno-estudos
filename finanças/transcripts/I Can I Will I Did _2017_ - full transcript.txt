- Run, little one. Run! - Where you going, Ben? Get back here. Where you going? - To mama? - Which mama? - Oh, here we go again. Little Ben's got no parents. Some poor baby. - Give me those. - I bet they're the most expensive thing you've got. - Let go! - Right? Easy, little birdy, easy. You want 'em back? Hmm? Are these yours or mine? I mean, I think they're mine. This whole orphan shit doesn't get anyone to like you more. The principal don't care. Girls don't care. We don't care. I'm keeping these, sugar. 'Til next time. Let's go. - Hello. - Hello. - Hey. Hi, you. How's it going? - Good. How was school? - It was just fine. - What did you get for your English essay? - A B minus. - Oh, that's very good. - So, they want us to read three books for extra credit. They cost about $60. - Okay, well your check comes in next week so just let me know what you need and I'll look it up online. - I'll just get it from the library. - What? - Nothing. What's up? - Look at this. So dumb. Describe your mother and your father. - Sometimes teachers, they just don't understand that we're different. - I kinda remember what she looks like. - Well, then you're very very lucky. - Yeah, I guess so. - Yeah, I guess so. What's to eat? - Salad. - Gross. - Okay, this is how this is going to work. I tell you to eat and you eat. Okay? Let's go. Bay, open your mouth. Bay. You know how many kids are starving in this world? They want vegetables too, you know? Are we gonna talk about your birthday party? You're gonna turn 18 and that means that you are going to age out. And that means that you have to that program before-- - Yep, I'll take care of it. Hey. - Hey. I know that birthdays can be scary, especially the older you get. - Well, I don't know about scary but definitely shitty. - Yes. But last year was good, no? - Yeah, last year was good. The year before that no. - Yeah. Yeah, but you weren't with me then. Didn't have a good day today, huh? - I'm okay. - Okay. I'm watching you. - Okay. - The fuck you going? Come on, buddy. - Hey, Ben. Missed you in chemistry. Got a secret lover you meet here everyday? - Why don't you give me those back. - What'd you say? These? - Yeah. - These are mine. - Let me ask you something. Why do you like me so much? - I think you're pretty. - You know what I think it is? I think it's because you have parents who really hate your guts. And I think the problem is you got-- - You don't get to talk to me like that. - Oh, I don't get to talk to you like that? - No, you don't. - You know what? You have little goons sticking up for you and you don't have the courage to back up your own stuff. You're a little midget bitch. Who, what? Do something about it. - I'm a what? 'Cause you don't get to say that! You don't get to talk to me like that, okay? 'Cause you're the bitch, okay? You know what? Pick his ass up. We're taking you home, Benny. - Get off me. - Right where you belong. - Get off me. Get off me. - Let's go. Let's go, boys. - I'm taking out the trash. - In the dumpster. In the dumpster! You see? This why you don't mess with Dorian. - Hey! Hey! - He's got some fire in him. - Ooh, orphan! - Come on! - Orphan, orphan. - Guess what? You already lost. - How you doin' in there, Benny? - Come on, Ben. Let's go, buddy. - Hey, smells like you, buddy. Come on. How you like it in there? Feel like home? Huh? How's the smell, Benny boy? Come on! - Yeah, Ben. Orphan. - Yeah, you already lost. - Yo, he's in a dumpster. - This is what you get! - How's it smell, Benny boy? - Hey. Put him in his place. - You're right where you belong, Ben. - In the trash. - Come on! - Bye, loser. - Bye, loser. - Hey Ben, where you going, Ben? - Fucking stop! - Cheap, huh? - Stop, stop it! - Huh, Ben? - Stop! - Oh fuck. Yo, come on, let's go. - Let's go, bro. Bro, let's go! - Sir, can you open your eyes? Sir, I need you to stay with me. - Stay with me. - Patient was found. - Ben. - Can you hear me? - Paramedics arrived on the scene-- - Can you open your eyes for me? - You're doing fine. - Patient's finally conscious. - We're gonna get you to the hospital. - No response. - We have a pulse. - Obvious left femur fracture. - Stay with me, keep breathing. You're gonna be all right. - Results are inconclusive as of yet, but we need more time. While he was anesthetized we took a battery of exams that we can have results for. At the moment just touch and go. He'd be glad to have a visitor if you can spend some time with him this afternoon. We'll have more answers. - But you're not telling me how he's doing. What's going on right now? - Well, we can run the scans again in eight to ten weeks and we'll know more then. But with any luck he should be feeling a prickling feeling in his legs in the next four or so weeks. - With any luck. - His nerve canal is very fragile. - So he can't move until then? - We have a top notch physical therapy team. - And I'm gonna need all the people in the team - Absolutely. - Because yesterday was one doctor, today it's another doctor and tomorrow's another doctor. - Hey. - Oops. Sorry. - Thanks. - Where are y'all going? - Actually a party at X-rays. There should be a gallon of water in your lap. - If all the ills of the world could be treated with water. My kidneys are being bitches. Well, I'm Adrienne and this is Bruce. I see. - Yeah. - My grandfather always warned me of the gloomy type. He says they're kind of a bore. I dare you to prove him wrong, though. - What are you shouting about me? - Nothing, I just mentioned your teachings. - Show some respect, this is hospital. - Yeah, Halabeoji, just wandered off. - Okay. Come on, buddy. Let's see if we can get some things moving, yeah? - Sit down. - He's so good. - Feeling any of that? Anything, Ben? Okay, let's try this. A nice stretch there. Come on, man, give me a little push there. - Well, the doctor says that you should be feeling something in your legs. And what about your arms? - Doctors say they're completely healthy. You just have to want to move them. - Ah, you hear that? You have to work hard, too. - Come on, buddy, we're on the same team here. - Ben, all we want is for you to be out of here soon, okay? That's all. - How about this one? - That boy's spirit is broken. - I'm trying to sleep. - It's 8:30, I'm here to hang out with you. - What are you doing? - Say hi to Bruce. Bruce, say hi. This is my dog. You know, he likes to be petted. One time I was having a really really hard day at the hospital and Bruce climbed on top of me and licked my nose. - Can you please get this dog off of me? - That's not very nice of you to say to Bruce. Brucey, say hi to Ben. Say hello Ben, I hope you feel better. Ruff, ruff, ruff, ruff, ruff. - I'd like to be left alone now. - Well, you're very moody. Me and Brucey will go now. Bruce, say bye. Goodbye. Come on, Bruce. - The lights! Shit. - Didn't work. - You tried. - So I started a new class, which is pretty good. I mean, I like the people in it. Are you too hot or too cold? - I don't know. - Well, that can't be true, you have goosebumps. - Cold then. - Here, let's put that on. Let's turn him. Okay. On me. One, two, three. There we go. Okay. I mean why not, I don't have anything else to do and I thought let's go for it, let's have a week out. Just chill out. I think it's about time we had that. There we go. Maybe it's too soon. Nah, I don't think so. Whoa! Where are you going? - Nowhere. - Okay. Well, I think we are done. Come on back. There you go, champ. - Woo woo woo woo. Beep beep beep beep beep beep. Thank you. Woo! Hey, Eric. - What do you want? - Did you see how fast I was going? - Yeah. - Were you super impressed? - No. - Do you feed him? - Who? - Him. - Well, we put the food in there for him to eat. On his psychiatrist's orders if he doesn't touch it, which he never does, then yes, we go in there and we feed him. - Can I try? - Be my guest. - Thank you. Bye, Eric. - See ya. - Oh god, not you again. - Oh, hungry and cranky, are we? Well, let's get ya up. Rise and shine. It's 12 o'clock. Look at you, lookin' all sunny. Okay. You know it's either me or no food today at all, right? There ya go. Oh yeah. - Fine. Go ahead, spoon feed me. I like big bites, by the way. - Okay, great. - More. - All right. - More. - Okay. - More. - All right. There you go. Isn't it good? It's my grandfather's recipe with extra spicy Sriracha sauce and extra finely chopped peppers in them. - Can I get some water please? - Oh, yeah. Right there. - Can I please have the water? - Yeah, it's right there for you to take. - I can't take it. - Oh, all right then. What the hell, man? - The water! What? - Come on. - Oh what? - You can have some. Have some more. - You want some more? What do you want? I see what you're trying to do. You think you can help me out, you think you're gonna be a good person, a good Samaritan. Right? You wanna sob story? Okay, I'll tell you one. You notice that the only person that's come to visit me is this one woman, right? No one else, just this one woman. She's not family, though. You wanna know what she is? She's my foster mother. The only reason that she comes to visit me is because she has to, because she gets paid to. That's my worth. Actually, my value's worth less because the God, or universe, or whatever the hell is up there, thinks I have more entertainment value as a cripple. So no, I cannot move my arms. But I hope you feel good about yourself. 'Cause that's the important thing. - I'm sorry, I just thought that maybe you would just-- - Get out. - I just thought you'd like spicy. - Why don't you get out? - Cripple is not a good word-- - Get out. - Why were you in there? I told you he's not our problem. - He doesn't have anybody. No family. Can you please help him? - You don't get to talk to me like that, okay? 'Cause you're the-- - Pick him up. - You know what? I think it's time to show him. - Hey, Benny. - We're gonna give you a lift home. Little bitches like you get this. - Hey. - You like that? - Is it salty enough for you? - You like that? - Huh? - Get off me! - Benny, we're gonna give you a lift home. - Get off me. - Okay? - Get off me! - Fuck! - I don't waste time, I only teach people who want to learn. - Learn what? - Taekwodo. My students win scholarships and tournaments. They become black belt less than two years. Catch this! So, you can do. - I guess I can. - That is your first lesson. I can means you believe. - My grandfather starts throwing stuff at you, it means he cares. I'll pick you up at 7:30 for breakfast. We're gonna do laps. - Laps? Hang on a minute. Just-- - Have a good evening! Sriracha's like the best spice ever. Even though Koreans aren't the biggest into it, but who needs to play into stereotypes? - Yeah, well, I think it's a little too hot for me. - Well yeah, it was, 'cause I saw you cry a little when I gave it to you in those mashed potatoes. - Okay, I did not cry. - I saw like a tear - I didn't cry. - coming down your eye like right here ever so slightly. - You wish, you wish. - Honestly, though, it's kinda too hot for me, too. I'm prone to stomach ulcers and I don't drink enough water so I get kidney failure every now and then. - Think fast. - Oh my god. Thank you! - I guess we're gonna just be throwing things at each other, huh? - You better eat that ice cream before it melts. - I've been eating it. It's just a little hard to multitask, you know. - Oh, right right right. You like, man? - Pretty good. - It's really good. Anyways, are you gonna apologize now? - For what? - Uh, for being such a boring ass. You fell into the foster system and you got into an accident, but look at me, I think my permanence in this wheelchair kinda has you beat. Don't you think? - No, I'd say we're about even. - How are we even? - How are we even? I've been in fist fights. - So have I. - Okay, but I've lost every single one. - Now people don't even wanna fight me anymore 'cause I'm sittin' in this wheelchair. What else you got? That's what I thought. I loath self-loathing punks. They would never match us on Tinder. - Well I'm not on Tinder, so-- - Yes you are. - I am not! - Yes! Why are you lying? - What, how do you know I'm on Tinder? - Do you ever get dates? Be honest. - No, I've never had. No, I'm not on Tinder. - Be honest. - That's good, lean into your arms. - I am leaning into my arms. My body is in my arms. - Okay, see if we can slide this foot-- - It's dead weight. - Oof, okay, okay. - Are you okay? You can do this. - Floor connects to your feet. Your feet to your leg. Your leg comes through your body. Your body connects your arm. Then you can find your balance. Do you understand? - I think so. - Get up, try again. - Sir, I really do wanna walk again, okay? But this time I just can't. - It doesn't matter if you're falling down 100 times. Floor likes you. The floor is your friend. Get up! Bend your knee. Straight back leg. Straight your body. Stay like this. Let's go. - He's insane. Oh my god. - It worked, didn't it? - Oh. Oh god. Help. Oh. Good job. Good job, Ben. All right. - Aye, my sweet boy. This makes me so so happy. - Yeah. Yeah, me too. I'm feeling a lot better. - Yep. Bueno, Mister Benjamin. What is your plan? You've missed a lot of school and you are-- - And now I'm aging out. - But if the state stops the checks then I can't take care of you. - I know. It's okay. - Ben, I am not kicking you out, right? You know that, right? You know that. - Yeah. - You can come to me. We just have to figure something out. - We will. I'll find some place to stay. - Open your present. - Okay. - Oh yes. - Thank you. It's a box, that's for sure. - Lily told us that you lost yours, so. - See? I told you people care. - She's right. - One more thing. No, two more things! - Lily, wait wait wait wait wait. Here, give this to him. They gave this to me after court. - Open your eyes. - Thank you. - The backpack was very dirty but everything else was there and I know how much it means to you. And the phone works. - No, it doesn't. I thought they stole everything. - Well, they got what they deserved. And you will never have to see them again. Okay? But this is a party. Okay, this is a party. This is not a party. - Yes it is. - So what's going to happen? Aye, Lily, Lily wants to do a special dance. - What is this? - Gimme a beat! - Aye, beat. - All right, you ready? You ready? Okay. - Go Lily! - I'm a cat. - Get it girl. - Yeah! - Yeah! - Everyone stay together. Continue, go. Hi, Bruce. - Only six students today? - After holiday, there'll be more. Tammy, bend your knee. - You know, Halabeoji, you could use some help around the office. Maybe Ben could live here and help you? - I don't want stranger in here. - Halabeoji, he's not a stranger and I just wanna help him. - He doesn't need your help. Enough. - Ladies and gentlemen. - Oh my god. - Please give it up for Hadagalango! The fastest horse in the stable. - Can you stop? - Keep on going. - Okay, but hang on. - What? - You're gonna make me fall. - You're not gonna fall. - Well could you stop recording at least? - You sit all day, don't you dare. Don't sit! - You do it. - Okay, touche, but I don't have a choice like you. - Yeah, well you know what? There are a lot of people who work me but I think you're like the queen of them all. - Wow, look at you two. I just wanted to tell you. You're on crutches and you're in a wheelchair and you're both just so inspiring. I just wanted to tell you that. Have a good day. - Okay. - Thanks? I hate when people say that to me. Like, I know they mean well but it just feels very demeaning. - One time I got "everything happens for a reason." Yeah, yeah, I wanted to punch them in the face. Have you ever gotten can I pray for you? - Oh my god. All the prayers in the entire world combined would not get me up and walking again. And, if one more person asks me to pop a wheelie I'm gonna pop them in the face. - Can you? What, can you pop a wheelie? - Seriously? - You brought it up. - Really? - Yeah, really. Really. - Impressed? - Yeah. - Nice. But don't tell me grandpa, okay? - Okay. Hey, so tomorrow there's this counselor, right, that's coming with Maria just to talk about some stuff and well, I was, I was wondering like if you would wanna be there too? - Oh no. - Okay. - Just kidding. Yes. But, only if you can make it around a whole lap today. - A whole lap? - A whole lap, you're wasting time, let's go. Come on. Get up, old man. - Oh my god. - One, two, three. Oh, let's go. Did you fart? Was that a fart? - I did not fart. - Oh. - It was my mouth. - Oh, okay, sorry. There you go. Today, though, like, I'm getting sleepy. - All right, easy killer. If I go any faster I'll probably just fall. - Okay, you're not gonna fall. Oh my god! Really? - Benjamin, this is real life. Between 800 and a thousand kids who are about to age out of foster care wind up homeless immediately. That leads to drug abuse, alcohol abuse. So, when you get on your feet you need to think about going back to school, finish, get your diploma. - I'm not gonna do that. - Why not? - Benjamin didn't have a good experience there. - I did read your file. I'm sorry about all this. All I can say is things happen for a reason, no? - I think maybe that I want something more. I'd like to see another city. - Well, you can travel, you can see the world. But school and a job are first. You need skills. - It's not easy, Benjamin. It's not easy, I know. - You can change your life right here, right now. You figure out what's important for today and tomorrow and the day after that instead of just getting overwhelmed by the big picture. But step one is a degree, a diploma, and that leads to a good job. And I have resources that can help you. - I think my step one is to learn how to walk. - Benjamin, por favor. - Thank you very much for your time. - Benjamin. - No, you're fine. - He'll be fine. He just needs a break. - She doesn't know who I am, right? And she just says the exact same thing to every single person that she meets. And those programs, they just don't work like that. They just don't work, okay? - Yeah, but how do you know? The programs exist for a reason. You're judging it before you're even trying it. You could really be letting a good thing pass by you. You gotta stop being stubborn. I know stubborn. I threw myself off of a horse. That's how I landed in this thing. - What happened? - He was this stunning black stallion with this gorgeous mane, and every time we rode it would just flow in the wind. And he was strong and he was free-spirited and so alive. I mean, I really wanted to tame him, I wanted to make him mine. And then my ego got in the way. I was just a massive idiot. - Can I show you something? I was looking up videos of your grandpa online, right? - Okay. - What, that's not right? - No, what is that? - A little defense. - Oh. No, that's not. - Your grandfather, though, he's pretty cool. - Yeah, he's no joke. You know he won the Dongbaek award? Which is the highest award you can get in Korea for public service. And on top of that, you know, he served on the '88 committee for the Seoul Olympics? - Did he teach you TaeKwonDo before your accident? - He did. You know, I almost got that scholarship. - Really? So you were like a black belt. - No. The scholarship isn't for the pros, it's for the one that shows the most spirit. You could get it if you wanted to. - Oh yeah? I don't know about that. But at least I got metal defense. Hey. - You need a worthy opponent or else that doesn't make any sense. - You're my opponent. Oh. - You like that? - Yeah. - Stand up. - Yes, yeah. Yeah, no, there's, um, we're just friends. - No, Halabeoji, he was just showing me something. - Show me. - Show you what? - Show me what you learned. - I, I, I, I, I've never taken class, I don't know what I'm doing. I haven't learned anything. It was just some videos online. - I don't want anyone learning from video. Show me. Be the defense or be the punch. - Sure, yeah. No defense, no punch. - No. Try following me, your attention. Stand in position. You widen up. Again. With a punch, with a punch. Three punches in TaeKwonDo. Ya! - Three. - Open with a punch. And now we punch again. Three more punches and kihap. Ya! - Ya. - Always kyungnet. - Bow. - Right, uh. - If you live in my dojang, you'll always have the Korean. - Hello. - Hi. - Been waiting for you. - Oh, sorry, how's it going? - What are you watching? - Uh, this is Master Kang. Some of his YouTube videos with him and his students. - Hm. What do you think of him? - I think he doesn't like me very much. - But he wants you to go live in his karate studio. - Taekwondo, Hopkido. - Same thing. - No, it's not. - You know what I mean. And this offer, what does he want? What is the catch? - I don't think there is one. - Aye, por favor, Benjamin. Nobody gives you something for nothing. That's not how it works. - Yeah, I know. I mean, I think I'm gonna be cleaning his house and maybe taking care of the dojang, but other than that. - So you decided this already? - No, but I don't really see that I have any other option. - No, Benjamin, you have other options. I can go and I can speak to Rosalie's brother about getting you a job at the grocery store. They're always looking for bag boys. Que? What's wrong with that, huh? What's wrong with packing groceries? I did it for three years before I became a foster mother and you know what? It is an honest job. - You're right, you're right. I'll look into it, I'll think about it, okay? But think, how cool would it be once I'm up, running, I could do stuff like that. Come on, you like it. - No, I don't like it. - It's cool. It's cool. - Aye, Benjamin, change that. - I like it. So, I've made a decision. I'm gonna work in your grandfather's studio. - Are you sure? - Um, can I sit? - Yeah. - Okay. So, I'm able to that because of you and your grandfather. Yeah, I'm sure. - Oh my god, I'm so proud of you. Oh my god. He's gonna love and hate this so much at the same time. - No, I'll make him like me. Goodnight, Bruce. Bye. - It is very important for me. - It is very important for me. - To respect my mom and daddy. - To respect my mom and dad. - Repeat. It is very important for me. - It is very important for me. - To watch. - To watch. - Listen. - Listen. - Learn. - And learn. - Okay, go. Good Charlie, yeah. - Sorry. - Around. - Hey. - That's okay. Kendall, let's go. Kendall. Kick up. Go again. Kick. Pound your foot, protect your arm. Again. - I wish my father made me do sports and martial arts or something. - Go! Again, go. Okay, good. - Ha, that a boy. - Jump. Around. Come on let's go. BJ. - Sir. - Kick up. Right there. Yeah. Pull up. Beautiful. Face off. Back. Come up, Alex. Kick up. When you kick up jump. Around. Again, turn around. Again, swing. Left swing. And hands up. Yes. Beautiful, okay. Repeat. I can. - I can. - I will. - I will. - I did. - I did. - I will not give up until I succeed. You understand. - Yes, sir. - Very good, Alex, very good. Good. Very good. Very good, Kendall. Take off your shoes, come on inside. Come on. - Okay. - You stay here, my rules. - Yes, sir, understood. - You like my granddaughter? - Uh, not that way. - Okay, come. Come here. Clean floor three times. Not one, not two, three times. And put that down. - Okay. Three times. Look out your window. - What I would give to climb down to you right now. - This kinda has like a Romeo and Juliet quality. Um, I could climb up. Is your grandfather asleep? Just-- - I'm not sure. I don't know if you can. - Hang on. Okay. Okay, so maybe next time. - Get going before you get caught on your first day. - Well, hang on. I have something to say. You keep encouraging me and, you know, I want you to make sure that you're giving yourself those speeches, too. Goodnight, Adrienne. - Goodnight, sucker. - Bye. - You ready, Brucey? Right, doggy? Hi, cutie. Okay, sleepy time. - So loud. Note this man here. He's doctor. He won a scholarship in Korea. Hi, Tom, how are you? - I'm well, sir, how are you? - Long time, no see. - Nice to see you, sir. - Go warm up. - Yes, sir. - Hey. - Ben, you too. Go downstairs, get a uniform. - Yes, sir. - Hey, don't worry, I'll go easy on you. It's just practice. - All right. - Okay, fighting stance. And come at you left punch. No, come underneath like that. Hook it. You hook it in like that, right? Your left leg's gonna come behind my left leg. Yeah, and you're gonna take me down, okay? - Okay. - And you pull here as you sweep the leg out and see, I'm falling. Bam. Nice. All right, your turn. Ready? - Yeah. - Okay. Ready like this. Yeah. Okay, so you're gonna start with the left punch, okay? Punch right here. Hook around, twos to the shoulder. Three. You good? - Yep. - Yeah? - Yeah. - All right, again. - Okay. - Nice. One, two, three. Nice. You good? - Yep. - One, two, three. - Ben, back inside. - Yeah, sorry. - Now focus, no distraction. - Yeah, sorry, sir. - You're here, you work, you earn. Simple. That is all that's life. - Thanks. - All right, here we go. I'm gonna do a big one. You guys ready for this, ready? Oh, did you see that? That was awesome! All right, now this side. Okay, watch how much air I get. Oh, yes! Yes, that was the best. All right, now we're gonna do downhill. I know you guys are about to be so impressed with me. All right, here we go, here we go. Okay, here we go. This is the fifth time, Halabeoji. Fifth time. I don't want anymore surgery. - You do not have any choice. Sometimes the thing you don't want to do is what you need most. You need the surgery. - I need to not be chained up in this hospital bed anymore. - Listen to me carefully. Act like person who's in charge - The lessons don't - of her life. - apply to me. I'm not an athlete facing off an opponent. - You're your own opponent. The lessons apply-- - You can't scare me into - to you the most. - Surgery when I'm not scared. - You should be scared. You're not thinking. Fear to feel. You must or you will die. - I mean, I'm not gonna be as good as Tom, that's all right. You know, but my legs are feeling stronger every day. They don't feel like two heavy bags of cat litter anymore. - That's nice. - Yeah. And your grandfather, he's just. I don't know, he's something else because, I don't know. Like one minute I feel like he's gonna come down on me really hard and then the next he just throws a curve ball. I don't know. Grandmaster Kang is just a tricky guy to figure out, I guess. - You call him grandmaster now? - Yeah, everyone does. - Since when are you like everyone else? - What's wrong? - You know, I'm really happy for you. That you're walking and talking and training and stuff but. - What? - What about me? You're leaving me behind. - What do you mean, what does that mean? - Ben, look at me. - Okay. - I'm still here. I will always be right here while you're out there making god damn strides. - Wow, okay, I'm leaving you behind, huh? - Yes. - I'm leaving you behind. Adrienne, that's bullshit. That's bullshit. When I was in here every single day you were up my ass trying to get me to do exactly what I'm doing right now. - Yeah, well I never encouraged bragging, okay? - Okay. Okay, you're upset that I'm walking and you're not. Okay, I get that-- - Really? - That's what you're saying! You were the one that told me not to feel sorry for myself and now you're asking me to baby you. What happened to the independent non-victim? - I never asked you to treat me like a victim, so don't twist my words around. - What do you want me to treat you like? - I'm asking you to treat me like an equal. - Okay, I can do that. I can do that, I can treat you like that. What exactly do you need me to do? All right, you know. Let's stop this right now and like-- - You know what? You're right. I don't think we should see each other anymore. - Wait, wait. Hey, you don't think we should. You don't, stop, you don't think we should-- - Get off me! - You know what, that's fine, Adrienne. That's fine, Adrienne. Your grandfather's really gonna appreciate that. He'll be happy about that. - Yeah. Because that's what we care about the most right now! - Shit. Okay. - What are you looking at? - They went to juvenile hall and one for three months and two for one week just until their court date was set. And one for one night because his father had a very good lawyer. And they all got community service and probation. - How'd they get caught? - One of them confessed and told on the others. - You never told me. - You didn't wanna talk about it. - You're right, I never asked about them. - Do you like living with the Korean? - Yeah, he goes by Grandmaster Kang. - Well, I'm Dominican and I do not get offended when people say that I am Dominican. - I know, but you call a doctor by their title, right? It's just a sign of respect. - Okay, fine. How is Grandmaster Kang? - He's something, that's for sure. - Hi senorita, hello. Homework. Open the door. Thank you. And if you want to help out with dinner later. - She seems nice. - That's Sonia. She came to us three days ago, she's in your bed now. She's very suspicious of everyone. We are still trying to figure it out. You see, you made it to my wall of faith. All my kids that move on make it there. - I saw one of them today. His name was Dorian. I saw him and I just ran away. Thanks. Excuse me, sir. Are we still gonna have class? - Maybe 9 o'clock class if people come. - Okay. Hey. - Hey. - How's it going?

It's so good to see your face around here. - You, too. - I've been meaning to send you this writing blog I stumbled across. It reminded me of yours. - Oh my god, that's so nice.

Can we at least give - Take out trash. It a shot? - I said no. - No, let me just do this, okay? Let's hang on, all right. Let's just do this, okay? And then we can all go home and have a nice day, okay? So let's just do this, okay? One, two, three, go.

Go, Tom, come on! Come on, Tom! - Hey. - Come on! - Okay, go. - Why are you giving him the nomination? Why are you giving him the nomination, okay? I thought it was for the hardest working student, not the most talented. Who has worked any harder than I have? Sir, I am walking. Sir! I am walking, I am working out, so what more do you want from me? How many people do you know who have worked as hard as I have? What are you saying? Adrienne, can you speak to me? What are you guys saying? What are you saying? Can we stop for a second, please? Just what are you saying? - He was just trying to impress you. - Can you guys speak to me, please? What are you saying? - You learned nothing. No discipline, no respect. You learn movements but Taekwondo is training for giving you character. You are not ready for nomination. Look for a new job. - Sonia Sonia, get the door, please. - That guy. Whatever. - What guy? Benjamin. - I. - What happened? - I couldn't make it work. - I'm sorry. - Thanks. Hello? - What the hell were you thinking? - I don't know. - You thought you could beat the shit outta Tom? - No, I didn't. - What, it made you think you were some kinda macho? Who you tryin' to impress? What are you doing? - Look, Adrienne. - What are you, five? - Adrienne, Adrienne. - Talk it out you don't just - just sometimes. - jump on a black belt. - Sometimes, okay. I want to say something and but I just don't know how. - Is that the case with me, too? - Why aren't you getting the surgery? - It's none of your business. I shouldn't of come today. Please don't contact me again. - Adrienne. - Look, Adrienne. - No. - Can we please just talk-- - No, no, you're just making it harder. - Adrienne. Adrienne. Great. Hi, how's it going? - I'm good. - Good. Sriracha, good choice. Great. - Sonia, we do not steal. If you need money you ask me, you do not steal from me, okay? - I don't need money, and if I did I wouldn't need yours. - Then why did you take my wallet? - I didn't. - Sonia, you are going to - I didn't do - because this is my house. - anything. Yes you did, you took my wallet. - It's my house now. - And this is not acceptable. Yeah, well you know what? It's my house and my rules and I so no liars and no stealers. Do you understand me? - No. - Well, then I'm going to say it in Spanish. Do you understand? In this house you do not take my money, okay? You want money, you ask me. Do you understand? You respect me. I respect you, you respect me. And these are yours to fold. - Oh, you can throw that away. - Don't get rid of it. - All right, then donate it. - Oh fuck. Let's go, come on. Run! - Let's go, man. Yo, let's go. - Hey, Ben. Easy. I'm sorry! - Oh, you're sorry? You're sorry? So what, your punishment is to pick up trash? That's what you do? - Yeah. Almost a year. Four months to go. Look, I know I deserve more than what I got. This is not like I like doing. The hazing and shit, it's just. You do it because you do it, you know? The best way I could keep others from doing it to me. When you was hit by that car it was too much. I mean, even an asshole like me knows that. These are yours. - No, you know what, you are an asshole. - Ben. Ben! Benjamin. - Tom, hey. - Hey, man. You work here? - Yes, yes, I do. - Cool. I was kinda worried about you. It's nice to see you landed on your feet. - Yeah, I think the last time I saw you was at the dojang that day. - Yeah, Hulk-out day. - Hulk-out day. - It happens to the best of us. - Listen, I'm sorry about that, you know. - Don't be, seriously. - That was. - Seriously, don't. Thanks. - Well. Well, it's to see ya, bud, you look great. It's really good to see you. Take care, yeah? - Hey. Did you hear what happened to the dojang? It was never about the money anyway. He just wanted students he could teach. It's closed. Breaking and entering. Interesting. - And after you. Wow. - Come on. Just do a light round. - All right. - Still remember all the moves? You're a quick learner for someone who was just on crutches a few months ago. - Yeah, you're right. - Ya, ya, ya! Well, they'd like you in Korea. - It's not like I'm going. - Neither am I. Ya! - Wait. - Ya! - Why? Master Kang can't give out nominations? - No, he can, he's still a Grandmaster, I just don't want the nomination is all. Ya! - All right, then. Why the private lessons? - I used to be a cadet at the police academy and one day on a routine patrol with the training officer we stopped this one kid who mouthed off. All the bad words in the book, you name it. The kid spat at me, all over my bright shiny uniform. I just snapped. Kid ended up on the ground with a broken arm, so. Then I found Master Kang. He taught me this isn't about fighting, it's about peace. I take the private lessons to give Master Kang some extra money into his pocket. - Does he know? - No. Get up. Ya. - Hey. That was a good one. - Listen. Here's my card. There's my cell on there, too. If you ever need anything. - Thanks. - And Adrienne. She got an infection this week. She's finally decided to have the surgery tomorrow. You should go visit them both. - Okay. It's good seeing you, man. - Talk to you soon. - Yeah. Coggs. - Hey, pal, look at you. - Hey. - It's so good to see you. - Yeah, listen, I need you to do me favor. - Okay, what's up? What are you up to? Mr. Kang, could I have a minute with you? We have some brochures we'd like you to read in preparation of post-recovery care. - Of course. I'll be back. - It'll just be a minute. Come this way. - What do you want? - You tried to tell me that you were scared and I wasn't hearing any of that because I was too wrapped up in my own shit. But I need you to know that it's okay. It's okay to not smile all the time. It's okay to be sad and angry. It's okay to be pissed at the world when it hasn't handed everything that you deserve. It's okay to not be okay. The minute that you're willing to accept fear, that's when you can start to heal. You understand? You can do it. Hey. - Thank you. - You're gonna kick this thing in the ass. You have to. You're gonna be great. - Okay. - Okay? - Okay. yeah, Halabeoji. Halabeoji, take care of Brucey. Ready. - Hey. - What do you want? - How many more years do you have before you age out? - Six more years. I'm guessing a few more homes between now and then. - I circled through a few myself. - Oh yeah? - Yep. A lot of kids pass through here. You know, Maria, she tries her best. They all do. But somehow just doesn't seem to be enough and it kinda just feels like the only person you can really rely on is yourself. Oh, so serious. Oh, she smirks. She can't contain it. That was a better one. - You're really annoying. - Nice. Hey, do you still have my uniform? - It's in the left drawer underneath the bed. - Hey, yeah it's Ben. I need your help with something. - I've been getting into fights since I was little. - Look, I know where you're coming from, I've been there. Ben's been there. You take that first small step, we'll take it today, together. Taekwondo is about three things. Tae means feet. Kwon means hands. And Do means way as in a different way of life. - Hey. So what's this about? - TaeKwonDo. - TaeKwonDo? Man, I don't think that's really my speed. - I think you owe me one. Close your- - So this way? - Fingers little by little. - Yeah. - Close it in like here. - Now when you punch. - Yeah. - All right. - And. Joon Bi. - Block it. - Okay, so up. Up, up, around, boom. Okay, when you go, you have to go up. - A nice deep stance when you move back. - Up, okay. - Ah. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Go. That was really good. Okay. - You're better than me. - Try again. - Yeah, let's do it. - Well, I think we have enough. - I'll call him. - Okay. - You brought the people here, why? - These are all students who wanna learn. - How about you? - I wanna learn from you. - Show me. - Tom. - No, show me. - Go on. - How do you feel now? - I feel calm. - This is TawKwonDo. You believe, you had a plan, and then you did. This is my true teaching. Okay. Everyone up. And now repeat. I can. - I can. - I will. - I will. - I did. - I did. - Now everyone follow me.
