How much longer until we reach your grandma's? About half an hour of walking. Cut it out with the jokes! We don't have to go by foot. Really? What, we order an Uber? Even better. - Grandma! - Yes! Welcome! - Where are you? - Come in, welcome! - Hello, grandma'! - Hello, there! - Good to have you! - Good to be here! - You too? Hello, child! - Hello, ma'am! - Hello, ma'am! - Hello, there! - You're kind of thin! - Oh, not really. Let me get you something to eat, put some weight on you! - That's Mircea. - Good to know. Let me get you something to eat! Do you want to go in the village later on? - What should we do in the village? - Take a walk. You two go ahead, I'll go visit uncle Vasile. - Who's this? - One of Vlad's uncles, who raised him. - Do you want to come? - No. But we're going to Mirica later on. Of course we're going. I'll see you guys later. Mircea! Dude, cut it out with the jokes! You're such an idiot! Honestly now! I'm getting in this! - Hold on! - What? Help me climb it. All right. - You know that someone died in this car? - Really now? Really. A 14 year-old girl. She killed herself. - Come on, cut the crap! - I'm serious! This used to be the firetruck. A house caught fire at the end of the village, but the fireman didn't get there on time and everyone died. - Yeah, right. - Honestly. She was sitting right there, right on your seat. She slit her wrists after killing all the goats. - What did the goats have to do with anything? - She was away with the goats when the house burned down. The whole family. Grandparents, brothers, the whole deal. The priest told her that God protected her, but she felt guilty. You're trying to get back because I scared you earlier! Go ahead and don't believe me. You can ask Vlad, or anyone in the village. She was sitting right there, where you are. She went to the fireman's to sharpen her knife. Then she got in the car, she slit her veins, head fell on the horn, then the people came. It seems that nobody has ever honked in the village since then. You're really something, you know that? - Hey, horse! - Hello there, horse! - Shall we go? - Where now? Mr. Mirica's. We'll meet up with Vlad there. Whatever. - I hope that this Mirica guy has got some food. - Of course he does! Mr. Mirica! Mr. Mirica! Damn it! - What's the matter, got scared? - Get away with that thing! - Why didn't you go in? - Nobody answered. Give me that phone. Who goes there? It's me, Mr. Mirica, Vlad. Mateiut's son. Little Vlad! Let me have a better look at you. How you've grown, little Vlad! And who else is there with you? Anastasia. Remember her, Mr. Mirica? Good evening, Mr. Mirica! She was living at the end of the village, and the river flooded her house. Yes, yes. Sit down, I'll give you some good berry liquor. Just a bit, though, we won't stay long. I'll also give you some fine chocolates... with kittens. Who's this lad? I don' know you. He's Mircea. I'm their colleague from college. College! This one thinks he's smart. - Well, he is smart. - And dumb in the same time. Since you're so smart, I'll give you an enigma. And if you solve it, you get a bottle of palinca. A riddle, you mean. That's a good start. Drink up! You're paying attention? Thirty white horses on a red hill. First they're chewing, then they're foaming. Then they sit motionless. A stud. Teeth. They don't teach you much at college. Cheers, drink up! Another one! You weren't warmed up, right? Yes. It goes like this. Say my name and I disappear. Who am I? Ghoul. Silence. Listen to him, ghoul! Do you believe in such a thing? - What? - What you said. In ghouls? I don't know. - It seems that you don't. If you say their name out like that. Actually I don't even remember what was their story. I'll tell you. Drink! It goes like this, the story. The myth: It says that if you hear someone calling out your name after midnight, don't answer. It could be a ghoul. And they'll freeze the blood in your veins. Some get blinded. Others get killed. Come on! These are children's stories. What do these ghouls look like? Seven years of bad luck! Take it easy, it wasn't the mirror. It's only the berry liquor. Hey, Mr. Mirica, do you know anything about wraiths? Catarina. Zalina. Marina. Come on, let's go. Leaving, Little Vlad? We're leaving, it's late. Look, it's already 2 A.M. Mr. student! You've got a bottle of palinca over there. Lucky you! Come back tomorrow. I'm having some people over for supper. Good health, Mr. Mirica! Good evening! See you! Little Vlad! Leave him, he's drunk, he'll stall you for at least an hour. Let's go. Come on, Mircea! You know how good this palinca tastes? I know, Mircea. Anastasia, listen to me! Come here, have a sip. Vlad? Damn stupid wraith! Come on, girl! Have a drink! Come on! Drink! Vlad! Yes! Breakfast on the table. Tomatoes, cheese, boiled eggs. - All right. - And stop by Mirica's, it's the nice thing to do. Yes, ma'am, thank you! See you! Good afternoon! Good day!
