TELL ME WHAT YOU KNOW. I WON'T KNOW ANYTHING TILL TONIGHT. THEY'RE COMING TO GRANDPA'S. WHO'S THEY? WHO? THEY ARE. YOU CAN EITHER COME TO GRANDPA'S AND FIND OUT FOR YOURSELF, OR... YOU CAN GO AND CHASE JIMMY. ( speaking Lakota ) Crow Horse: HE SAYS BACK BEHIND RED DEER TABLE THERE ARE STRANGE BEINGS FROM ANOTHER WORLD WHO EAT STONES AND DIRT AND WHO WILL KILL ANYONE WHO CROSSES INTO THIS PLACE. THIS IS WHAT THE SPIRITS SAY. HE SAYS THEY SAW YOU GOING BACK INTO THE LAND BEYOND RED DEER TABLE. I WAS WITH YOU. BUT THAT'S ALL THEY TELL SO HE DOESN'T KNOW IF YOU WERE KILLED OR NOT. HE THINKS YOU PROBABLY WERE BUT IT WAS A GOOD DAY TO DIE. GO TO RED DEER TABLE. GO TO THE LAND WHERE THE ELK PEOPLE USED TO LIVE BUT YOU MUST GO AS TWO. THIS IS THE VISION I RECEIVED. I HAVE SPOKEN, AND IT IS SO. Woman: RAYMOND? RAYMOND? GET AWAY FROM HIM, RAYMOND. COME HERE TO ME. HE'S DRUNK. GET AWAY FROM HIM. LET GO OF HIM! COME ON. COME HERE. LET GO!

THEY'RE ALL INDIANS. IT'S A MESS. I'VE BEEN STUDYING THIS FIELD FOR NINE YEARS, RAY. I KNOW MORE ABOUT THE LAW AND THE HISTORY OUT HERE THAN THE PEOPLE THEMSELVES. LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING. I FEEL FOR THEM, I REALLY DO. THEY'RE A PROUD PEOPLE BUT THEY'RE ALSO A CONQUERED PEOPLE. THAT MEANS THEIR FUTURE IS DICTATED BY THE NATION THAT CONQUERED THEM. NOW, RIGHTLY OR WRONGLY THAT'S THE WAY IT WORKS. I'VE SEEN SOME FIELD AGENTS BREAK THE RULES OUT HERE. I'VE SEEN EXCESS AND ERROR. BUT I'VE ALSO SEEN TWO AGENTS, FAMILY MEN LAYING BELLY-DOWN IN THE GRASS WITH THEIR HEADS BLOWN OFF AND THEY WERE JUST DOING THEIR JOB, RAY. IDEALISTIC AGENTS, LIKE ALL THE REST OF US. PROTECTING THE INTEGRITY OF THE AMERICAN DREAM. LOOKS TWICE IS AN ENEMY OF THE UNITED STATES, RAY. THAT'S ALL THERE IS TO IT. SENSITIVE OPERATIONS UNIT. YOU BETTER BELIEVE IT. NOW GET IN THE CHUTE, PUT YOUR VEST ON AND LET'S GET READY TO TAKE HIM. YOU OKAY ABOUT THIS? SURE. PUT YOUR GAME FACE ON AND GET OUT THERE TO THE OLD MAN'S.

RAY, MY FAMILY'S BEEN INVOLVED SINCE COLUMBUS LANDED. LISTEN, MY PARTNER IS CREATING AN AIRTIGHT CASE. JIMMY HAS NO CHANCE, EXCEPT FOR THIS EVIDENCE. NOW, IF THIS WERE TO FALL INTO THE WRONG HANDS I THINK IT MIGHT DESTROY THIS CASE. CROW HORSE TOLD ME THAT A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO YOU HELD A RAFFLE AT A BENEFIT CONCERT. DID YOU KEEP ANY RECORDS? I CAN'T DO THAT, RAY. THIS EVIDENCE IS THE ONLY POWER WE HAVE TO BUILD A CASE. THAT'S NOT POWER, RAY. THAT'S PAPER. OH, CHRIST. RAY! POWER IS A RAINSTORM. POWER IS THAT RIVER RIGHT THERE AND THAT'S WHAT I HAVE TO PROTECT-- NOT THE WHITE LAW. IF JIMMY GOES TO PRISON FOR BEING A WARRIOR THAT IS SOMETHING HE ACCEPTS. THAT'S HIS WAY. THAT'S OUR WAY. IT'S THE INDIAN WAY TO LET JIMMY GO DOWN. YOU CAN'T UNDERSTAND. YOU'RE NOT INDIAN. MY FATHER WAS AN INDIAN. YOU NEVER KNEW HIM. I KNEW MY FATHER. HE WAS CRAZY. HE BUILT BRIDGES AND SKYSCRAPERS WITHOUT A SAFETY HARNESS IN HIS BARE FEET. I KNEW MY FATHER, MAGGIE. I WAS ALWAYS AFRAID HE'D FALL AND THAT HE'D SAY, "DON'T WORRY, WASHI. I CAN FLY." THAT'S WHAT HE'D CALL ME. HE CALLED ME WASHI, BUT HE COULDN'T FLY, MAGGIE. HE TRIED, BUT... HE DRANK HIMSELF TO DEATH... IN FRONT OF ME AND MY MOTHER. I WAS ASHAMED OF HIM. SO I BURIED HIM TILL MY OWN PEOPLE DUG HIM BACK UP. MY OWN PEOPLE. WHAT? WASHI. DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS? HE SAID IT MEANT "GOOD BOY." IT'S THE LARD WE PUT IN STEW. GREAT. I THINK HE WAS CALLING YOU A CHUBBY BOY. WHOEVER BOUGHT THIS TICKET KILLED LEO FAST ELK. I GOT TO GO, RAY. LISTEN, THERE'S ROADBLOCKS EVERYWHERE. IT'S NOT SAFE. I'LL BE OKAY, RAY. WHERE ARE YOU GOING? TO THE SOURCE. THE SOURCE? YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DO THE SAME... WASHI. ( laughing ) ( chanting ) ( screaming ) ( engine starting ) HELLO. ( speaking Lakota ) GRANDPA, SPEAK ENGLISH, PLEASE? LISTEN, I NEED TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S HAPPENING TO ME. I... WHAT... YOU GOT TO GET OUT OF HERE. Looks Twice: I BELONG HERE. WHY AREN'T YOU AT RED DEER TABLE? WHAT IS THE BIG DEAL ABOUT THAT PLACE? CAN'T I GET A STRAIGHT ANSWER? FAST ELK FOUND OUT ITS POWER, SO THEY KILLED HIM. WELL, THEY'LL KILL YOU IF YOU STAY HERE. SOMETIMES THEY HAVE TO KILL US. THEY HAVE TO KILL US BECAUSE THEY CAN'T BREAK OUR SPIRIT. LOOK I DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS. YOU DON'T HAVE ANY CHOICE. I AM TRYING TO HELP YOU. WHY WON'T YOU ACCEPT THAT? IT'S IN OUR DNA. YOU HAVE TO DO WHAT OLD MAN SAYS. WHAT MAKES YOU SUCH A THREAT? WE CHOOSE THE RIGHT TO BE WHO WE ARE. WE KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE REALITY OF FREEDOM AND THE ILLUSION OF FREEDOM. THERE'S A WAY TO LIVE WITH EARTH AND A WAY NOT TO LIVE WITH EARTH. WE CHOOSE THE WAY OF EARTH. IT'S ABOUT POWER... RAY. ( door banging ) Mackey: F.B.I.! GET THEM UP, JIMMY. GET THEM UP! GET THEM UP! GET THEM UP, JIMMY. GET THEM UP! GET UP, SON OF A BITCH. Mackey: ON YOUR FEET, GRANDPA. YOU'RE IN LOTS OF TROUBLE.

Mackey: YOU BEEN TEACHING THESE CRIMINALS ABOUT THE GREAT RED SPIRIT, SAM? CHECK HIM FOR PEYOTE. HE'S GOT A KNIFE! HEY, WHAT IS THIS, A MAGIC RATTLE? YOU GOING TO DO A RAIN DANCE-- END THIS DROUGHT? HE DOESN'T KNOW ANYTHING. LEAVE HIM ALONE! HEY, HEY, TAKE IT EASY! HEY, TAKE IT EASY, DAMN IT! FOR CHRIST'S SAKE, WE GOT HIM, DIDN'T WE? YOU GUYS JUST CALM DOWN AND TAKE IT EASY, ALL RIGHT? IT'S ALL OVER. ( speaking Lakota ) Cooch: WELL, WE NAILED HIM, JACK. I KNEW HE WOULD HAVE TO COME BACK TO GRANDPA'S SOONER OR LATER. RAY MADE THE COLLAR. WELL, THE ARM IS BUSTED. MAYBE NOW WE'LL HAVE A LITTLE PEACE HERE-- NO MORE AGITATORS STIRRING UP TROUBLE. GOOD, KOLA. Cooch: LET'S CLOSE THIS THING OUT. DRINKS ARE ON ME AT THE BUFFALO BUTTE. WHOO! WE'LL SEE YOU OVER THERE, RAY. MAKE A COLLECT CALL TO DAWES-- TELL HIM HIS INDIAN DID ALL RIGHT. WE'LL BE OUT OF HERE TOMORROW. Milton: YEAH, SEE YOU LATER. LISTEN, UH... I'M NOT WHO YOU THINK I AM. I'M SORRY. UM, BACK THAT WAY IS A PLACE CALLED WOUNDED KNEE. I WAS ONE YEAR OLD THERE WHEN THEY CAME AND SHOT OUR PEOPLE DOWN BECAUSE THEY WERE GHOST DANCING. THEY BELIEVED THIS DANCE WILL STOP THE WHITE MAN FROM COMING AND BRING BACK THE BUFFALO. THEY SHOT 300 OF US. ONE OF THOSE KILLED WAS A HOLY MAN CALLED WAKIYAN CANTE-- THUNDERHEART. HE WAS KILLED WHILE RUNNING FOR THE STRONGHOLD. IT IS HIS BLOOD-- THE SAME BLOOD THAT WAS SPILLED IN THE GRASS AND SNOW AT WOUNDED KNEE-- RUNS THROUGH YOUR HEART LIKE A BUFFALO. THUNDERHEART HAS COME-- SENT HERE TO A TROUBLED PLACE TO HELP HIS PEOPLE. THAT'S WHAT I'M TOLD. ( chanting ) ( chanting ) ( chanting ) ( engine starting ) RUN. RUN FOR THE STRONGHOLD, THUNDERHEART.
