(funky uptempo music) (tense eerie music) - [Anton] After life, after death. The madness begins. (tense eerie music) My name is Anton Lupesky. I single-handedly invented Emphorium, a drug that can make your soul leave your body and enable you to enter any human corpse provided it has eyes. Without eyes, your soul can neither enter nor leave the shell of life. The problem with Emphorium thus far is that it affects the nerve center and causes severe hallucinations. Most humans I have experimented on die from the fright of the hallucinations. So far, I am the only human able to withstand the madness of the drug and re-animate carcasses with my own soul. (tense eerie music) - Hello, this is Susan Slattery reporting for WFIV News. We were outside the state medical examiner's office, hoping to get some comments from Dr. Janet Simpson, former Administrative Head of the recently closed Whitewood Institute. What was her relationship with Dr. Anton Lupesky, whose experimental surgery is now under investigation. This is what we hope to find out. - [Woman] There she is. - Let's go, there she is. Dr. Simpson, Dr. Simpson! Have a few questions, Dr. Simpson. (talking over each other) - [Janet] I have nothing to say, really. - Dr. Simpson, does the closing of the institute have anything to do with the research done by Dr. Anton Lupesky? - Dr. Lupesky is no longer associated with the Whitewood Institution, closed or otherwise. Excuse me. - [Woman] Did you fire him? - Dr. Simpson. You're considered to be a hero now that the plague of patient deaths has been discovered. Do you feel this is because of your personal investigation? - Hardly, I hardly think so. I was just doing my job, and I sincerely hope that the grim circumstances surrounding the closing of the Whitewood Institution doesn't mar its otherwise fine reputation for research. Excuse me, I have to go, really. - Dr. Simpson, what about Dr. Lupesky? - Dr. Lupesky's awaiting trial right now. - [Susan] And at trial, what about the outcome of the trial? What's your comment? - If there's any justice in this system, Dr. Lupesky and his research will be out of commission for a very long time. Excuse me, please. - Wasn't he conducting experimental brain surgery? (talking over each other) - [Susan] Because of your personal relationship with Dr. Lupesky-- - [Janet] I have nothing further to say, excuse me. Get this microphone outta my face. - [Susan] What about the senseless violence at the institution? - Excuse me, I have to leave. (engine grumbling) - Well, there you have it. This is Susan Slattery, reporting for WFIV News. (tense eerie music) - [Woman] Dr. Anton Lupesky, noted international scientist, was acquitted today of all criminal charges filed by the Whitewood Institute. Although fully cleared and licensed by the United States to continue his research, Dr. Lupesky has chosen to continue his research outside the country. When asked why he wanted to leave, Dr. Lupesky responded, and I quote, "I prefer to work in a country that is receptive "to new ideas and not in profit gains." He's expected to leave at the end of this week. (tense eerie music) (tense electronic music) - It all started when my father died. Then I began to investigate, and that's when things really got crazy. (tense eerie music) - [Bill] Dearest Kim, I fear this will be my last letter to you, for I sense the end of my life is near. I know you will think me mad, but please listen to what I have to say. I know Lupesky is a respected doctor, but he is not as he appears. I have seen him as others have not, with his guard down. The man is pure evil, an agent of Satan, if not the devil himself. I have looked into his eyes. They are the eyes of the demon. If you could see them but once as I have, I know you would not doubt me. This hospital is an evil place. The things that go on here are beyond the most diabolical nightmare. I long to see it closed down and to see the living evil that is Dr. Lupesky finally put to rest. I know I have not the power, nor the time to bring this about. There is one doctor, Janet Simpson, who seems to understand there is something wrong here at the Whitewood Institute, but I fear she does not realize the extent of the danger, and by the time she does, it may already be too late. Dr. Lupesky wants my soul. Not just my death, but my very soul itself. To him, it will be like food, sustenance for the insatiable evil that fries within him. Already he has tried to kill me with his noxious poisons. So far, my faith has been strong enough to save me, but I cannot hold out forever. As my body weakens, my mind goes feeble and the pure, constant faith is difficult to sustain. Love always, your father, Bill Castle. (tense eerie music) (tense music) - [Man] And on a smaller note, Dr. Anton Lupesky, former head of research at the Whitewood Institution has returned to the United States after a brief stay in Luxembourg. When asked why he was returning, Dr. Lupesky responded that the facilities in the United States were far superior to those abroad. (tense music) - [Jessica] Carl, Carl wake up. Carl, you've gotta help me with the doctor's medical equipment. The doctor'll be home in 15 minutes. Carl, wake up. - Leave me alone. - [Jessica] Carl! - [Carl] Wait a minute, will ya? - I'd love to leave you alone, but you've gotta help me with doctor's equipment. I can't lift it all by myself. - Oh, Jesus. - Don't you think the doctor and I would like to be alone for a bit every now and again? Do you really think that we like you following us around like a hungry, sick dog? - I ain't no dog! - I'm sorry. It's just that, doctor's been away for a long time and we have a lot of work to do. I wonder how he was received in Europe. I wonder if he did any new research on soul transference. To exchange souls with a person from a different culture. Absolutely fascinating. I've always wanted to speak French myself. - Jessica, I don't know what you're talking about. I just hope you're in a better mood when Lupesky gets back. - What do you mean? I've been in a fine mood. - Yeah, since you got the letter from him. Why can't you just admit that you love the man? - Carl, don't be ridiculous. I'm only interested in helping the doctor further his research in soul transference. There's never been any romance between the doctor and I. Not really. - Who the hell are you kidding? You know that you love him. - Enough of this nonsense. Get out of this bed and let's get going. Come on. (tense eerie music) (screaming) (tense music) (tires screeching) (thudding) - Would you hurry up? We're already late as it is. - [Woman] All right, all right. Okay. - Okay, you ready? Great, let's go. - Oh wait, my keys. I'll be with ya in a minute. - Okay, I'll meet ya outside, all right? Just make it quick. - Okay. (tense eerie music) (thudding) (grunting) (tense beat music) Where the hell are my keys? Find them. He's gonna kill me. Saint Anthony, where are my keys? (grunting) (tense music) (grunting) (thudding) (grunting) Hello keys, where are you? (screaming) (tense rock music) (mumbling) (breathing heavily) (tense music) (footsteps thunking) (screaming) (tense music) (maniacal laughing) (tense rock music) (groaning) (tense eerie music) (garbled mumbling) (ominous music) (screaming) (mumbling) (alarm beeping) (gasping) - Oh my God. I'm gonna use this snoozes. - [Sandra] Good morning. - [Kim] Hi. - I don't know why I ever bother to cook for you and all you ever do is grab coffee anyway. - Sandra, I don't know why you bother, either. - You look tired. - [Kim] Yeah, thanks. - Did you sleep well? - No, I had this really bizarre dream about a priest last night. It was wild. - I think you're working way too hard. - Yeah well, you may be right. Anyway... - You're not gonna smoke already? At least eat something before you smoke. - I can't eat, it's too early. I gotta go. I'll see ya later. - [Sandra] It figures. - [Both] Bye. (funky uptempo music) (typewriter keys clacking) (chattering) - [Kim] Hi. - Hi, Kim. - Kim. - [Kim] Hi, Scotty. - You're not going in there, are you? - Yeah, sure. - I wouldn't if I were you. He's in kind of a bad mood today. - [Kim] I can handle it. Oh, listen, do me a favor. Run some copies off of this and see what you can find out the Whitewood Institute. I think it closed about two months ago. - Okay, but I think he's planning to cut the story. - [Kim] My story? - Yeah. He was talking to us about it yesterday and uh... - [Kim] He's planning to cut the story, my story, without talking to me about it? - Yeah. - [Kim] Oh this is great, great. - I don't care what you say. That's not the way we do things around here. If you wanna get paid, you're gonna have to come out here yourself. I don't care. - I have to talk to you, Frank. - Dammit, Castle, what the hell do you want? - Listen, Frank'll get back to you, thanks. - I'm gonna fire your-- - Yeah, listen, Frank. I'm a good reporter, no, I'm a great reporter. You've been jackin' me around. - Oh, not nice talk for a lady of your stature. - Oh cram it, Frank. Listen, am I gonna get that story or what? - You through? - Yeah. - Sit down. (typewriter keys clacking) Okay, I'm gonna stay calm. Look, Castle, you're good. No, you are great, but this story you have on fading religion is so, well, who cares? - [Kim] That's exactly my point. - So what? Now, if you're doing something like, about religious bedhopping, now that's news. - [Kim] Oh Frank, you're such an asshole. Why do you insist on keeping this paper a rag? - Gimme a break, Castle. This newspaper is a rag. I just print some local gossip and run ads for the local hardware store. You act like it's the goddamn New York Times. - Well, if a few more people took it a little more seriously, it would be more than just a neighborhood sleaze tabloid. - [Frank] Yeah, sure. Answer a question for me. - Yeah, what? - [Frank] Does this have anything to do with your father's death? Be honest. - Yeah, maybe. But I really think there's a good story, here. - [Frank] Look, Castle. Kim, I'm sorry about your father's death. I really am. I understand he was a great religious man. - Oh you're so full of shit, Frank. I know you thought he was crazy. I mean, the man had emotional problems, but there's a lot more going on here. - [Frank] Excuse me for being rude, but didn't he think he was Jesus? - Fuck you, Frank. Do I have to take this story to another paper? - [Frank] What other paper? The supermarket circular? - Ah, I didn't realize you were so funny, Frank. - Okay, you can have your story, but on one condition. - [Kim] What's that? - You do it on your own time. If it's good, I'll print it. If the people like it, you can have your very own weekly column. The World According To Castle. - [Kim] Sold, and it will be good. - Make a believer outta me. (typewriter keys clacking) - Right, right, mmm hmm. Listen why don't we meet in the park? Yeah, you know where the gazebo is, right by the pond? No, yeah, that's it, right, right. Why don't we say I'll leave here in 15 minutes-- - [Colton] You better make it 20. Got this. - My favorite cop. How you doin', Colton? - Yeah, what's goin' on? What a mess you got here. What do you got for me? - What are you, Director? - Yeah, okay. Who you talkin' to? - Kim, got that one letter. - Don't be givin' her any information. - Naw, I'm not givin'. - All right, I'm outta here. - Oh, is the donut truck here yet? - [Colton] Yeah, cinnamon danish? - Cheese. Yeah, I'll figure maybe a half hour. All right, I'll see ya then, bye bye.

Experiment number 38. After previously determining that this young woman's lacrimal glands were secreting saline fluid properly, I shall proceed with my next experiment. You don't do drugs, do you? No, I previously checked that. You're a clean girl, you're a good girl. You're a lovely young woman. You're untainted by foreign substances, your mind, your body and your soul. Don't worry about a thing. This is only glucose. It will help to sharpen your memories a bit. And this, my dear, is adrenaline, much like what your body was producing earlier this evening. It acts as a sort of a booster, to help you to feel your memories as though they're happening now. Makes them come alive. Don't worry, dear. Everything will be okay. You see, Lisa, it's your soul I'm after. I'm a master of souls. I possess many souls but periodically I need to enrich myself with the soul of a young woman, a beautiful young woman who secretes a magnificent essence that I need to tangle up with the web of my soul. I need the essence and you will provide it for me. (creepy piano music) Yes, I just want it in me. (tense music) (creepy piano music) (tense melancholy music) - [Zack] Well, it's really great you got that story. - [Kim] Yeah, I worked my butt off, Zack, to get the story, and now I think I'm on the wrong story if you tell me about these abductions. - Well, hold it right there. First off, I never called them abductions, you did. They're listed officially as disappearances, all right? Second off, if anybody down there at the station finds out I'm telling you this stuff, I'm out of a job. - Oh, come on. That's never stopped you before. - I'm serious, these guys, I mean, I'm out on my ass. - Bullshit, Zack. Why'd you tell me, then? - 'Cause I have a big mouth. I'm serious, that's all I know. All I know is that these kids disappear, that's it. There... There's some talk about a doctor. - [Kim] What doctor? - I don't know who he is or what his involvement is. He's some big shot. I don't who he is, but they're really keeping things very quiet about it. - Oh, so what's new about it, to cover up anyway? - This one's a little weird. They're talking a devil worshiper. - Okay, sounds like more kids on drugs. - Naw, not this time. This is really strange. This is like, hoods and sabbats and five point stars. I mean, like, they're talking like big shots mixing it up with the devil. - Maybe that could be a story. Why don't you just keep me in touch with anything and everything you hear on this, okay? - Don't I always? - Yes, you do and I appreciate it, Zack. - It is. Ooh, look at that, look. Water rat. (tense music) (phone ringing) - Hello? Oh, Kim, it's you. You scared me. I'm reading this horror novel. What? Oh okay, yeah, I can pick up your video tape. Yeah, let me write it down. Since when are you into uh... devil worship? All right, yeah I'll pick it up for ya later. Oh yeah, by the way, there's some chicken in the fridge if you get hungry later, okay? All right. All right, I'll see ya later. Right, bye. - [Anton] The ultimate etymology of the soul is uncertain. The first written example of it is circa 825, according to the Oxford English Dictionary. It was spelled S-A-W. The great philosopher, René Descartes, located the pineal gland in the brain, the eye-like conical gland behind the third ventricle, where the body, he determined, met the soul. Or was it vice versa? Off by itself, not one of a pair, and not centered in the middle. But I've proven that theory to be wrong. I am able to pass through any corpse provided it has eyes, portals to the soul. Yet, no two souls can occupy the same space simultaneously. Janet Simpson, that damn, that damn doctor, forced me to resign from the Whitewood Institute and I remember as if it were yesterday when I ever so humbly debased myself in an attempt to win her over. You know, Janet, I have devoted my entire life and considerable genius to studies of the quantum mechanics of the soul and the energy of vision. Now, Lady Montague in 1716 said and I quote, "Our vulgar notion that they do not own "women to have souls is a mistake." And I would have to heartily agree with that because a women secretes the most magnificent essence from various glands in the body-- - [Janet] That's outrageous, Doctor. That's simply outrageous. - [Anton] You call it outrageous-- - [Janet] Your views are not only inappropriate, they're sexist. - [Anton] If you'd take your nose out of the library books, perhaps you would begin to understand-- - [Janet] We have reviewed your paper on the soul, Doctor. Speaking for myself and the board, we want your resignation tomorrow at the latest. - [Anton] I say-- - [Janet] Do you understand that? - [Anton] And the board are as big a pack of horses asses as I've ever seen. - [Janet] We want your resignation tomorrow. - [Anton] Like children, you each cling to your own little view of the world-- - [Janet] That's enough, Doctor. - [Anton] Whining endlessly, trying to convince yourselves that your view is correct. - [Janet] Your views will not stand in this hospital, Doctor. - [Anton] Allow me to speak, Janet. Never will any of you stop to realize that all you hold is a minute piece-- - [Janet] I think you've gone on far enough. - [Anton] Jigsaw puzzle. More massive than you can ever hope to imagine. - [Janet] You're insane. - Only by integrating all your disciplines into one single discipline and throwing in a smattering of religion, I dare say, which I know you all disdain so, can you ever hope to come to even the meagerest understanding of the universe. - You're not making any sense at all. We want your resignation tomorrow, and that's final. - [Anton] You can't fire me. (smacking) I quit. (tense music) (laughing) (cricket chirping) - Oh, I forgot to tell you something. - [Janet] What? - Lupesky's back. - [Janet] What? - He's back. He came back from Europe. He's been back here six months. - Six months? I don't believe this. - [Chrissie] I know, he bought that Matson house, out in the south part of town. - [Janet] I can't believe the gall of that man-- - [Chrissie] I know. - [Janet] Moving back to town like that. - [Chrissie] I know, what are you gonna do? - Well, I got him kicked off the board the first time. I'm gonna run him outta town again. That man's dangerous. - But what are you gonna do then? He's just gonna go and do it someplace else. - I've got to go down there and find out what he's doing. I've gotta stop him, Chrissie, I've gotta stop him. - [Chrissie] Mmm. - I don't believe this. (tense music) - Hey Zack, can I get the most recent file on the missing persons? - [Zack] Yeah, yeah. Here you go. - Thanks. Captain wants to give this another once over. Seems like these kidnappings are giving us a rash of overtime. - You can say that again. Hey listen, is there anything new on that witness to the last abduction? - No, not really. It turned out to be this guy who was leaving the bar who had a five martini dinner. But he was positive that it was a maroon van that was involved. And Zack, a woman called us about 20 minutes ago and told us that her daughter went out last night and didn't come home. I told her that she had to wait the requisite 24 hours before she declared a missing person. I'm afraid she's gonna end up like the other girls. - Man, this is gettin' outta hand. - You're tellin' me. All right, I'll see ya later-- - [Zack] See ya later. (creepy piano music) - What's all this stuff? - Oh, I'm tryin' to find out all I can about devil worship. Zack thinks it may somehow be involved in the kidnappings that I was telling you about. - But I thought that they couldn't prove that they were kidnappings. - Sandra, don't be so naive. Oh, you'd make a hell of a reporter. - Is that what this tape's about? - Yeah. I got it down at the video store. It's kind of a history of devil worship in the U.S. - Well, enjoy. I'm going to bed. Listen, if you get tired, make sure you put your cigarette out. I don't want you to burn the house down. - Okay. Thank you. Goodnight. (creepy piano music) (gasping) (tense eerie music) (creepy piano music) (gasping) Oh, shit. (crickets chirping) (doors thudding) - The doctor is going to be furious with us. We brought nothing back. - Never mind about him. Don't, you know, you always, you're always tellin' me about what he-- - Don't ever speak about Dr. Lupesky like that in my presence, do you understand me? - He ain't God, man. He ain't so... (stammering) Who is he? - Good evening, Doctor. - [Anton] Good evening, Jessica. Good evening, Carl. - Dr. Lupesky. - [Anton] I trust you accomplished your little mission with your usual aplomb? - I apologize, Doctor. We were unsuccessful this evening. - They just aren't out there, the young women and all. (stammering) Don't seem to be uh... - [Anton] Women are everywhere out on the streets these days. - In all honesty, Doctor, people are beginning to speak about the disappearances. They're beginning to get suspicious. - [Anton] Now, Jessica, Carl. If you had only executed my little plan as I had said, they would appear as though they were runaways. (stammering) - You're right, Doctor. You're right. - [Anton] Absolutely I'm right. - I apologize. We'll try again. - [Anton] Let's get on with it. (phone ringing) - Hello? Zack. Whose is it? Lupesky? Oh my God, Lupesky was my father's doctor! Yeah, hell of a coincidence, Zack. I don't buy this kind of coincidence. Yeah, we'll check it out. Great, okay. Thanks for calling. Good work, Zack. Okay. Right. Bye. Yeah, bye. Oh my God. (funky uptempo music) (screaming) - [Carl] Too bad she didn't see that two by four, huh boss? - It is pretty funny, Carl. - [Carl] Yeah, I know. (chuckling) Yeah. - [Anton] Okay, let's take her in, Carl. - [Carl] Okay, boss. - [Anton] 'Bout time you did something right. - [Carl] Okay, boss. - [Anton] Come on in. - [Carl] Just a minute, I'm stuck. - [Anton] I gotta line her up. - [Carl] Okay boss. - [Anton] Push her up, Carl. - [Carl] All right, boss, I'm done. - [Anton] You're strong, come on. Push her up, push her up. Lay her up there good. Put her up on this meat hook, here. - [Carl] Right, boss. - [Anton] Let's get out, weird. - [Carl] Can't seem to get outta here, boss. (talking over each other) - Back up. Back up, you bumbling... Son of a bitch. I never liked her anyway. - Oh, that was wonderful work, Doctor. (chuckling) - Would you clean up this odor, please? - Yes, of course. (hissing) (uptempo music) (tense music) - [Kim] Hello. I'm here to see Dr. Lupesky. - Yes, the doctor is expecting you. Please step this way. - [Kim] Thank you. Dr. Lupesky, thank you for finally seeing me. I realize you're a busy man. - Jessica, would you please get us some iced tea? (tense music) Miss Castle, I'm granting you this interview for one reason and that's just to put an end to your incessant badgering. - Well, Dr. Lupesky, I'm sure calling six times a day asking you for an interview may seem like badgering, but in the newspaper business, we call that persistence. - Persistence in the pursuit of a worthy goal is admirable. Persistence in the pursuit of nonsense is merely annoying. - I can't believe you consider it nonsense that the public would be curious about a man as exceptional as you are. - Oh, my scientific work is documented in journals of international renown. - I'm sure it is. I was really referring to the curiosity of the general public. - Oh, the general public. I hear so much about the common man these days and frankly, Miss Castle, I dare say that they wouldn't have enough intelligence to understand even the most simplified explanation of my work. - The technical aspects I'm sure would be a bit much for your average daily paper, but sir, what we're really interested in is the man behind the work, Dr. Lupesky the man as opposed to Dr. Lupesky the scientist. (tense ominous music) (tapping) (clinking) (thudding) - My personal life is of no consequence related to my scientific work. I really don't think your readers would be interested. Oh, thank you, Jessica. - Thank you. - That will be all. (tense ominous music) - I'm sorry sir, but I think that the readers would be very interested in getting some background information on you. For instance, what university did you get your doctorate from? - Did you do any research before you came here today? I have numerous doctorates from universities on both sides of the Atlantic. I recommend you go to the local library and do a little research in their reference section. - What about your career, sir? Did you spend some time at the Whitewood Institute? - Yes. - Dr. Lupesky, isn't it true that you were fired from your position there? - Absolutely not. I merely wanted to pursue some personal research for which the institute lacked the facilities. - That's funny, because I remember hearing accusations made by the institute that you were involved in experimenting with severely retarded and incurably insane patients. - Utter nonsense. You see, the scientific profession is not immune to the petty jealousies which exist in other professions. Now, I have been responsible for numerous scientific breakthroughs. Some say more than my fair share. As such, I have been accused of many things. Allegations, there's been smear campaigns going on. Actually, I think this interview is beginning to take that turn, also, and it's over. - Sir, I would think this is a perfect opportunity to clear up any bad-- - Jessica! - Wouldn't you like-- - It's over. - To keep your reputation clean? At this point-- - Jessica! - I would think that this is the perfect-- - Jessica! (tense ominous music) Upon my soul. I trust you gave her enough Emphorium? - Yes. The nerve of that bitch. - Castle, Castle, I've heard that name. - Well, you'll soon be reading about it in the newspapers. (moaning) - I wonder if it'll drive her incurably insane, or kill her. (tense ominous music) (laughing) - All is a dream within a dream. All that I see or seem is but a dream within a dream. (laughing) (growling) (tense music) (growling) (tense music) - [Kim] This is my father's institution. It's now closed down and abandoned. I don't understand. (tense ominous music) (tense music) - [Bill] Kim, this is your father. I've come for you. I've come for you from beyond the grave. Join us, come join us. (tense ominous music) (gasping) - [Kim] Oh my God, you scared me. - What's the matter? Calm down. Calm down. (talking over each other) Your father? - [Kim] He's out there. You should see his face. Oh my God. - There's nobody there. (whimpering) What is the matter with you? - [Kim] No, no, I'm not going. - There's nobody here. - [Kim] Don't go, Sandra don't go over there. - There's nobody here. (tense music) (eerie music) - Dr. Lupesky, Dr. Lupesky. - Carl, I'm busy working. - I need a, I need a fix, I need a fix bad. - I'm busy working, Carl. - Dr. Lupesky, I need a fix! Please, I need one now! - Carl, leave, the door's over there. - I'm not leaving! I need drugs and I need 'em now. I need some juice. Just stab me, poke me. - Carl, when you complete your agreement, I will give you some drugs. - You want, (stammering) I've done everything I can for you. - Carl, I'm busy working. - I realize you're working, but-- - When you complete your agreement, Carl, when you bring me women that are-- - I been bringing you women, you've been-- - The last woman you brought me was 30 years old. - I been doin' my best. - The other woman you brought, some chippie from some favorite alley of yours was so riddled with drugs it was practically useless. - I been doin' my best, Dr. Lupesky! I need a fix, I need one now! - [Anton] Carl, I'm busy. - You want men, I'll bring you men. You'd love men, I know you would. You-- - Stop, Carl! Stop it, Carl. - I'm sorry, Dr. Lupesky. I know you're busy-- (stammering) - Stop it Carl. You're a vile piece of human (mumbling). You're a useless stick of, Carl, you contemptible wretch. When you make your pathetic little attempts at talking to me, you do not look at me. Now, turn around! Turn around! Now, is it drugs that you want? - [Carl] Yeah, yeah, yeah. - [Anton] And what are you going to bring me? - [Carl] I'm gonna bring the women, plenty of 'em. - What kind of women? - [Carl] Young women, young women. I'll find 'em, I'll-- - Young, healthy women. - [Carl] Healthy, healthy, yes, healthy, young. - Pathetic little stink. (mumbling) Is this what you want? Yeah, this is what you... When will you bring 'em? - As soon as I can, as soon. (tense music) - [Anton] Now, get on your way. I want young women! Young women! Young women! Get outta here! (melancholy music) - Jesus Christ. I mean, I can't believe that. - [Kim] I know, so real it was scary. God. - And you're sure you were drugged? - [Kim] Well no, I'm not sure, but I can't come up with any other explanation. I told you, I went to his house. After getting all this information on this guy, let me tell you, there wasn't a lot to get, either. I found out about him being at Whitewood-- - [Zack] Right. - [Kim] And that he was involved in these experiments with retarded people and with crazy people and I tell you, what I think was happening, he was using some drug that had, had something to do with the soul and apparently the Board of Directors considered it too controversial and they kicked him out. And somehow, it's tied in with my father. I'm sure of it. Personally, I think this guy's crazy, Zack. I think we should do something. - [Zack] I don't know. I think we should tell somebody. - [Kim] Oh no, we'd be making the exact same mistake that the hospital made and that's by letting this guy know that he's being watched. We've gotta do this secretly. (tense music) - Sounds like we're gettin' in over our heads, here. I mean, from what you tell me, this doesn't sound like something we wanna screw around with. - [Kim] I'll be careful. I'm just gonna go up to his place and take some pictures. I think maybe I can check things out and go somewhere from there, but I'll be careful, really. - I don't know. All this talk about this stuff reminds me of what my grandmother used to tell me when I was a kid. - [Kim] What? - She always used to tell me that the eyes were the windows of the soul. I was a little kid, used to scare the shit outta me. - [Kim] Yeah well, we're not little kids anymore, Zack. I don't think, I mean, I think we can handle this. Don't worry. (melancholy music) - Kim? Yeah, it's Zack. Listen, remember when I told you about that legend my grandmother told me? You know, the eyes are the windows of the soul, right? Well, I was up in our attic and I found some of her old things in a trunk and I came across this book, this old book, on turn of the century folklore. After weeding through most of it, I came across this one poem called Soul Of Macumba. Okay, listen, I have it written here. Open thy eyes so that I may enter. Open thy eyes so that I shall live. Open thy eyes so that my embodiment shall be renewed. Mmm hmm. Did you get it all down? (tense music) Listen, there's also been another disappearance. Yeah, in the same general area, uh huh. (tense chimey music) Okay, listen, I gotta get going. Mmm hmm, yeah, I'll call you later. Yeah, I gotta go, bye bye.

Suppose you're doing a little research, dear? - [Kim] Yeah, you bet. - [Jessica] Dr. Lupesky will see you now. Please step this way. Bring her up now! - [Kim] Who, me? (tense music) - Stupid idiot! Get her! (funky uptempo music) (crashing) (hissing) (tense music) (beeping) - Come on, Zack. Zack, it's Sandra. Listen. Kim went to Lupesky's house. I don't know what she's up to, but she told me she wouldn't be more than an hour and she's been gone now four hours and I haven't heard a word from her. Okay, I'll be there in five minutes. Oh, and Zack, maybe you should let the police in on this, too.

If I'm not back in five minutes, call the police. Ask for Kolchek. He knows me, he'll back me up on this. - [Sandra] All right. - [Zack] Here goes nothin'. (beeping) (mellow rock music) - Oh my God. (screaming) Oh! (uptempo organ music) (tense music) (thudding) - Wait a minute. Wasn't this door nailed shut? Get me a flashlight, Carl. Just see what's in here. (thudding) Oh, God. Well, she's not in here. Get me a nail and a hammer, Carl. Get this door nailed shut. Nail it shut. (pounding) (tense music) (mumbling) (clanking) (laughing) (screaming) - [Anton] Oh, a visitor. (clanging) Miss Castle. - [Kim] No! - [Anton] So glad you could drop by, dear. - [Kim] No! - You know, your name sounded familiar to me, as well it should because your father was one of my earliest patients and a man of superior intelligence he was. Yes, when I gave him his first dose of Emphorium, he survived. I thought he was slightly insane, but, alas, the second dose which I gave him which I thought would push him over the edge, so to speak, into the full realm and beauty of the soul, it killed him. I'm so sorry to say. You survived your first dose of Emphorium, too. Must be a genetic anomaly in the synapses of the brain or some such. Perhaps it's heredity. Who really knows? Listen to me when I talk. (gasping) Listen to me when I talk! - [Kim] You bastard! You killed my father! - Ah, you might survive your second dose of Emphorium, too. - [Kim] No! - Yes, you may. - [Kim] No! - You'll be able to share the beauty and experience of the soul-- - [Kim] No. - To fly with another soul is the greatest exultation in all of creation! - [Kim] Ah! - Yes, it is. You know, I developed Emphorium as a favor to you lovely-- - [Kim] You son of a bitch. - Other humans, thinking that it might prove to be a short cut to the beauty of the soul, yet alas, it seems I overestimated the intelligence of other humans because everyone else seems to die. Now, let me give you another second dose and perhaps you can fly with me into the realm beyond. Oh, to share the vision and experience of the realm beyond us-- (Kim yelling) So wonderful, you would not believe. - [Kim] No! (grunting) - Is it a genetic anomaly? Ooh, yes. Your nightmare is just beginning. (laughing) - [Kim] Oh! (eerie music) - [Sandra] Kim! - Sandra, I'm back here. I'm so happy to see you. Oh, thank God. No! Oh, no! - What's the matter? Don't I look pretty? (tense sinister music) (laughing) (tense music) (tense ominous music) (laughing) (tense music) - Now, this isn't gonna hurt a bit. Well, maybe just a little. - Sure I say-- - No! - Let's see if you survive. - No! - [Jessica] Doctor. (mumbling) (screaming) - [Kim] No! - Interesting to see what happens this time. (thudding) - Hold it! Cops are on their way. Knew something was up when Sandra wasn't back at the car. - Oh, really? - Yeah. (laughing) - [Kim] Oh, no! (mumbling) He'll be back. - [Zack] Why, why? - Look around, look around. Do you see anything moving? Oh my God. - [Zack] What am I looking for? - [Kim] See anything moving. - [Zack] Move. - [Kim] You don't understand, Zack. He's left his body. He's gonna re-animate a dead body. (tense eerie music) (mumbling) - [Zack] I'm not fuckin' around, stop. (gunshot popping) Hold it! - [Kim] Shoot him! - [Anton] Soul can be at any place at any time. You ignoramuses cannot begin to comprehend my powers. (laughing) (tense music) (laughing) (grunting) (maniacal laughing) (tense music) - [Kim] Lupesky, you bastard. (grunting) (tense music) - Jesus Christ. - [Kim] You okay? - What is going on? - I can't explain now. Remember what you were telling me about your grandmother, and the eyes of the soul, the windows of your soul being your eyes? We gotta put these guys' eyes out, or they come back to life. I can't explain it, it's too weird, but for some reason, these zombies are takin' over, 'cause of the eyes. - Oh Jesus Christ. - I know it's really weird, Zack, but you have to trust me on this one. (gasping) (tense music) (groaning) - Interesting theory, but you ran out of time. - Look out. - Oh, shit. (uptempo rock music) (gunshot popping) (growling) - [Kim] No, Sandra, No! (crashing) (uptempo rock music) (slurping) (squishing) - I'm over here now. I'm faster than you, I'm faster than you. (maniacal laughing) (tense music) (sinister music) - [Kim] Lupesky, are you... (tense music) - I did it for my amusement. Huh huh huh huh huh. (ominous music) Stop 'em, Carl. Stop 'em! (thudding) Stop 'em! - Tired of this shit, Dr. Lupesky. You been tellin' me to do this, you been tellin' me to do that. I am sick of it, man. I'm tired-- - Carl, calm down. - Listen, you four-eyed little-- - Stop it. (talking over each other) - I'm tired. - Stop it, goddammit, Carl! (tense music) Stop it, Carl. - I ain't stoppin', no, not this time, Doctor. - Take care of 'em. - [Carl] No, no. - Take care of 'em, Carl. - No. Not this time. (tense music) (thudding) (crashing) - [Anton] Goddammit Carl! (tense sinister music) (tense music) (tense ominous music) - [Kim] Oh, you son of a bitch. Lupesky, where are you? (harsh tense music) (tense music) - [Cop] Halt, it's the police! - Oh God, thank God you're here. (retching) (mumbling) - [Cop] Lock these guys up. - Wait a minute-- - Shut up! Shut up. (groaning) - There's somebody alive over here. Oh right, you're gonna have to call 9-1-1. (retching) (mumbling) (funky music) - Jesus Christ, is that Kolchek gonna ever stop throwing up? - [Cop] I doubt it, he is really sick. - Cap, we're ready. - All right, what do we got? - Well, in last night's incidents, two were killed, and there must be about 12 other bodies rotting down there now. - Jesus Christ. Those kids must have been telling the truth. This was self-defense. - If it was self-defense, why did they poke out the doctor's eyes? He was already dead. - [Captain] How the hell do I know? - Incidentally, the medical examiner wants to talk to you. - Okay, thanks. - They're all dead. It's a bloody mess down there. They'll be cleaning up for hours. Kim Castle and Zack Madden, they're all right. They've been taken in. They're bein' treated for shock. (sinister music) - You're not gonna believe what's goin' on in there. - [Captain] You, get up there and just make sure you put a seal on everything. Now, now, now! (mumbling) - Uh oh, here comes the Chief! - Oh, shit. - I'm really goddamn mad over this whole situation, here. The young man says there's all blood over the place. - [Captain] Hey, Chief, you know everything I know, don't you? - Yeah, but what did he say? - I'm tellin' ya, Captain, I never seen anything that bad. - Patrolman, go check out Kolchek. - I just don't want this thing to blow out of proportions and get to the press. I'm holding you responsible if it does. - Hey, we're putting a lid on it. We're doing the best we can, okay, okay? - You're right. I always know from your reputation, you've always done a good job and you won't disappoint me now. - Okay, Chief, right. Thank you, thank you. - Thank you. (sinister music) Okay, as long as you promise me you'll keep the lid on this. That's all I can ask. - [Captain] Okay, okay, we're working on it. - Okay, what did you see down there? How bad is it? - It's gonna be a few hours, Chief. - Well, there's nothin' we can do. - [Captain] All right, all right. (sinister music) (tense eerie music) - I thought that the spider baby was an excellent character reference to Margaret (mumbling) and her films. - Personally, I think all this movie stuff is bullshit. - Well, it's finally over. - Yep. You know if someone had told me a year ago that any of this was possible, I mean, even vaguely possible, I'd never have believed 'em. - [Kim] Pretty wild. And if I'd been those two cops coming down the stairs and saw what they saw, I'd have put us away. (chuckling) Immediately. - I know we came about this close to gettin' arrested. Jesus. And now, now they love me down there, now. I'm a bigshot. - Yeah, I meant to ask you. - I'm a bigshot. - What, so they been treatin' you good? - Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, I'm a big hero now. You know, I don't, it's weird. Now you got the column now. - Yeah, I got my column. - Right, the world, it's like, taste this. - Paid a hell of a price for this column, you know. - Certainly did. But I'll tell ya... If you'd stayed in the car. You shoulda stayed in the goddamn car. (mumbling) - But I thought at least we got them all. - I know. Once you got up, I thought I was gonna die. 'Cause I thought I-- - I was gonna pass out. - Excuse me, will there be anything else? - No, I'm fine. - No, no, thank you. - Thank you. - Thanks.
