(banging) (dramatic music) (gentle music) - [Dylan] Please make him come back Mommy, please. - Remember how I showed you? Use you body to protect the ball. - Okay Dad, ill try it again. - Okay, let's do it right this time. - Okay Dad. - Alright, okay. There you go, good job. That's what I'm talking about, good shot. (sobbing) - Hush now. Everything's gonna be okay. You'll see. - Ah. I hate you, you hear me? I hate you! Why would you do this to me? I'm your son! (sobbing) (upbeat music) - On this team you will work. (chanting) On this team you will always give 110%. You will leave every ounce of all you got on that floor. On this team you will work hard, and you will get better, no exception. (record needle scratches) Is that understood? - [All] Yes Coach. (whistle blows) - Alright, bring it in, come on, come on, come on fellas. (clapping) (gentle music) Hey, welcome to the Warriors fellas. How ya feeling? - [All] Good Coach. - Alright, well before we get out there, I want you all to line up, give me 50 free throws, and we all done, alright? Let's go, Warriors on three. One, two, three. - [All] Warriors. - Good job, great job. (clapping) Great first practice. - [Randy] Hey D, what's up? - Hey, what's up man? - Man, them boys is looking good out there. - Yeah man. - You know we only got three months until national championships, right? - Oh yeah, but hey, we got some games lined up before then, so it will be alright. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - So, what's up? - Well look, I don't want you to get all upset and everything. I seen Stoney talking to Tywan the other day. - What? - Yeah, he gave him his card and everything. - So, sniffing around my players again? - It looks that way. - Alright, well don't worry about it, I'll talk to him. - Okay, well make sure you do, 'cause we can't afford to lose any of our guys. - I know man, look, I'ma talk to him, alright Randy. - Alright. - Hey baby. - [Dylan] Hey. - How was your day? It was good til about an hour ago. - What happened? - Stoney is sniffing round my boys again. - Again? - Yep. Randy said he saw him talking to Tywan. - Dylan, don't worry about that. Look, Tywan and the rest of those boys, they know who has their back, and who has their best interest at heart. Honey, I see the way you always ripping and running around trying to make sure they have everything they need. And you stay on the phone with the college coaches and scouts trying to get them recognition. But most of all you are there for them whenever they need you. So if they don't see that and if they don't appreciate it, then I say let 'em go. - Yeah, you're right. - Dylan, please don't stress about this. - I'm not stressing. It's just that every year, I get these boys together and start working on their game. And when I get them tapping into their full potential, here comes Stoney, flashing them sweet gym shoes and trying to sell 'em pipe dreams, and making these false promises. - Dylan, you can't worry about that stuff. All you can do is what you can do, and let God do the rest. Honey, what He has for you is for you and nobody can take that away from you, no matter what. Not even Stoney. - Yeah, I guess you're right. - Aren't I always? (laughs) - Yeah and how's my baby boy doing in there today? - He's doing great. You know, he's moving around a lot. I don't know what I ate, but whatever it was, he didn't like it. - Hey little man, you stop giving your Mama problems in there. Now there's a lesson you know. You working on that spin move. I love you baby. - I love you too. - I can't believe I'm about to be a daddy. - I know, right. You are going to be such a great daddy. The best. (lips smack) - I can't wait. (laughs) (gentle music) (hip hop music) - Hey Ma. - Uh-huh. What are you doing? - Nothing. - That's what I thought. Now come on up over here and run up to that store for me. - Why Ma? You already been drinking and I got homework. - Boy, don't you talk back to me. I'm the grown up. And I pay all the bills up in here, okay? So if you wanna continue enjoying the comforts of my home, then do what I tell you to do. I don't know why you talking about no homework any way, because you're dumb as hell. It ain't like you're going to college or nothing. Get yo stupid butt up, and go to the store and get my stuff. (sighs) (gentle music) (basketball bouncing) - See you been working on your form like I showed you. - Yeah Dad. - Good, the Coach said there's a few scouts that wanna offer you off for visits, so I'm gonna take some time off so we can go together. - Okay Dad. - How's practice? - It was good. - Good. - Tournament's coming up this weekend, we gotta make sure you put up some impressive numbers, so those scouts will take notice. - Yes, sir. - Don't stay out too late. - Alright, come on Red, move your feet, come on. Alright back up top, back up top. Red, will you stop reaching man with your feet. Come on man. Set it up, set it up. - [Player] Go, go, go. Hey, hey, wait, wait. - Alright, alright, come on, come on. Set it back up, set it back up. Hey, switch it 2-3, 2-3. No man, no man, 2-3, come on. (whistle blows) Hey, you two get over here, get over here. Tywan, Mike, get over here now. What seems to be the problem with you two? Did y'all forget you're on the same team? - You ball hogging, Coach. Give me the ball, I'm wide open. - Maybe if you would catch the ball once in a while when I do pass it to you, you would get it more often. - Hey, hey, hey, knock it off, let's go. (whistle blows) On the line, on the line, let's go, come on. On the line, let's go fellas, now. - That's what I'm talking about man. - Fellas, we are a team here. And it appears to me that some of you guys don't understand that concept. We got a scrimmage tomorrow, and I am not gonna be embarrassed, you understand? - [All] Yes Coach. - Huh? - [All] Yes Coach. - So until you guys get in your thick skulls what it means to be a team, we will run. You will not touch a ball, and you will run until I get tired. Is that understood? - [All] Yes Coach. - Thanks a lot girls. - What was that? - Nothing Coach. - Let's go. (whistle blows) (sighs) - Something funny? - Yeah, man. Nice shoes, what did you do, kick rocks all the way over here? - Oh, one more time. - Hey, hey, hey. (shouting over each other) - Whoa, whoa, whoa, back off! - Get off me man. - Chill out bro. - You two wait right here. Everybody else get outta here, now! Let's go. (lockers slamming) Now you two been playing with me for over two years now. And you know I'm not gonna tolerate this type of behavior on this team, understood? - [Both] Yes Coach. - We're a family here fellas. And we treat each other with respect. This is a team. So if your brother don't shine, you don't shine. We all got a role here to play. So we all can shine together. All this on and off the court beef you two got going on. It stops right here, right now. Is that understood? - [Mike] Yeah. - Is that understood? - Yeah whatever. - Look, I'm sorry Coach. - Look Mike, don't say it if you don't mean it man. - He just can't stand the fact that I'm better than him. - So what makes you think you're better than him Mike? Listen, don't think I don't see what's going on out there. Yes, you are the leader when you're out there. But you also gotta remember you are part of a team. You can't win these games by yourself Mike. And I you keep trying to be a glory hog, you're gonna fail. You know that pride comes before the fall, man. You will get to where you're trying to get to, I have not doubt about it. But don't try to get there by stepping on the backs of your teammates. - Look, I just wanna be the best. - Mike. Sometimes being the best, means doing what's best man. (gentle music) - T, hold up man, let me talk to you for a minute. What's going on with you man? - Nothing, I'm just tired of him running his mouth all the time. He always got something smart to say. - Man, don't let him bother you like that. You're better than that man. Look, what's really going on with you? I ain't never seen you pop off like that before. - Nothing Coach, I'm good. - Randy said he saw you talking to Stoney the other day. What's that all about? You thinking about making a move? - No. - Would you tell me if you were? Look, T. I just want you to be able to come and talk to me about anything, not just basketball, anything. I mean if it's your grades, if it's girls, whatever, I just want you to be able to come talk to me, man to man, friend to friend. Look man, I know how Stoney operates man, and I just want you to know man, the grass ain't always greener on the other side. But if you ever feel like this ain't the team for you, I just ask that you come let me know. That's all, alright? - Alright Coach. - Okay, I ain't gonna hold you up any longer. You need a ride home? - No, my Mom's coming. - Okay, I'll see you tomorrow. - Yeah okay. (sighs) (phone ringing) - [Voicemail] Please leave your message. - Know what we're gonna do today? (commentator chattering) - I think. (mumbles) - I think we should do. (mumbles) Hey, how was practice? - It was good. Hey Ma. - [Renee] Hey. - I'll be coming to your scrimmage tomorrow. I wanna see how things are coming along. - Okay Dad. - Honey, you hungry? - No, I'm alright. I think I'ma just go upstairs, take a shower and go to sleep. I'm pretty tired. - What? Aren't you forgetting something? - Can't I just do it in the morning? - You think I got to be an all-state champion with a division one scholarship to play college ball, 'cause I put things off until the morning? No I didn't. Now shoot those free throws and then you can go to bed. - David, let the boy go to bed. - No, no Renee, he needs to understand, if he wants to go the distance he has to put in the work. You wanna play college ball, right? (clanking) That's my boy. (upbeat music) (distant shouting) - Yeah, good job T, baby. Good job boy, yeah that's right, now get back, get back. Oh good shot, dang. Alright, come on, come on, come on. Run the play Mike, run it Mike, come on. Mike, set it up, set it up. Come on Mike, set it up. Alright Mike, alright, set it up Mike, set it up. Mike! Come on fellas, come on. Team. Alright, come on. Alright, alright, run White this time Mike, come on baby. Set it up, set it up. Mike, I just told you, no forced shots man! (cheering) Do it again, run it again, run it again, run it again. You had Dewey right open in the corner! Come on, use your team man. Mike, run the play, run the play. (clapping) (distant shouting) (whistle blows) Run the play, come on now. Time out, time out, time out. Time out, time out, time out! Get over here. (whistle blows) Warriors on three fellas, one, two, three. - [All] Warriors! - Good job, good job boys. - What happened out there? - I don't know man, he took me out, I was on. - That's what I saw, I'll handle it, don't worry. Coach, yo man, good game. - Hey. - I couldn't help but notice that you took Mike out after that pivotal three. What was up with that? - Well, he was told to run a certain play, and he chose to do what he wanted to do. So I put someone in who I felt would get the job done. - I see, but-- - David, listen. Now, you know I respect your opinion. And I welcome your feedback, but right after a game is not a good time to talk to me about your son's playing time. Look, I'll be more than happy to talk to you tomorrow after practice, okay? - Tomorrow then. - Thank you. - No, thank you. See ya. - Players don't worry about shoes. (mumbles) The name's Infinity Squad. We take care of our players, we got money to move around and make things happen, you're a great player, good game out there.` - Hey, hey, hey, go ahead, go ahead to the car fellas. - [Stoney] We all need to see that, real life. I just wanna let you know (mumbles) we make sure we take care of our players. Hey Coach, just telling my man, T-Money, what a great game he had, ain't that right, T? - Yeah, Coach can we go now. - Yeah T, go ahead to the car, I'll be right behind you. (distant chattering) So you sniffing around my players, huh? - Hey, no need for the hostility man, I'm just telling the boy what a good game he had, that's all. - You stay away from my players Stoney. (laughing) - You did real good today. - Thanks. - I'm gonna talk to your Coach about your playing time. - Dad, you don't have to do that. - No, he needs to understand that if he wants to win, he needs his best player on the court. He's not allowing you the flexibility that you need to play your game. - Okay. - This your last year at AAU, you gotta make sure you shine. - Good game today man. - [Tywan] Thanks Coach. - Hey, don't forget to remind your Mom about the parent meeting tomorrow. It's very important that she comes. - Okay. - So, how's summer school coming along? - It's going pretty good. I got all of my assignments turned in, so as long as I do good on my tests I should be alright. - Okay, well you know I'm gonna be checking in with your teachers, right? Okay? - Alright. - Alright, well hey, you're going into senior year man, so if you finish summer school strong, then you get your GPA back on track with college, You know I been pulling a lot of strings with these college coaches coming to see you with your grades the way they've been? - Mm-hmm. - But, if you keep working hard, and get a good ACT, you've got a lot of schools to choose from. They're really calling about you man. - Really? - Yeah, so stay focused and keep working, alright? - Alright. - Hey, tell your Mom about the parent meeting. - Alright, I will Coach. - See you tomorrow. - See you tomorrow. (gentle music) (crickets chirping) - Hey Coach. Yeah. Yeah, Tywan had a really good game tonight. Yeah, I'm glad you were there to see it. Okay Coach, alright I'll talk to you soon. Okay, bye-bye. - Hey. - Hey baby. (lips smacking) What you reading? - Beautiful Rage, the break of dawn, by Janaya Black. - Mm. - It's really crazy so don't ask. (laughing) So how did the scrimmage go? - Oh, that Tywan, he had a great game tonight. - Really? - Those coaches were on the phone, from state. He was there to see another player, called me about Tywan. - Really? That's great you know, I think Tywan is really a nice kid. - Oh yeah, no he is. He's just has it a little rough right now. You know, his Mom's raising him by herself, and from the looks of it, she seems to be a little too pre-occupied with other things. And it's really starting to make him suffer. - What do you mean by pre-occupied. - Well, it's like every time I seem her, she's either drunk or high. - Oh wow. - And she never has any money for him. I mean we got a scholarship and all, but I mean, like today, I seen him, his shoes are just falling apart. I mean, I ask him all the time, "Do you need anything?" He always tells me, "No." - Well he's probably ashamed to tell you that. - Yeah, you're probably right about that. Tomorrow I'm gonna go get him some shoes. I mean, I can't have him out there in shoes that's falling apart and turn his ankle or anything. And then I overheard Mike clowning him the other day. - Are you serious? - Yeah. (sighs) I don't know what I'm gonna do with that boy. I mean he's a good ball player. He's actually really good. But, you know, his dad's got him thinking he's a one man show. He had the nerve to come to me after the game today, asked me why I pulled his son. (laughing) - So you let him have it right? - No, I just told him he can come talk to me after the parent meeting right after the practice tomorrow. And baby, sometimes these parents make me just wanna lose it. - Oh Dylan. Honey, you're not gonna lose it. And do you know why? - 'Cause I don't wanna go to jail, that's why. - No, because you're doing God's work. Dylan for the past eight years, I have watched you Coach and mentor different groups of boys, and so many of them have gone on to do great things. Why? Because you took the time to care. You've been a father to some and a friend to all of them. It takes a special man to do that. - So I'm special, huh? - Yes you are. - Special enough to get that-- - Not a chance, oh no. - Come on. - I'm not cooking tonight. - What, come on, are you serious? - Very. - Oh my, mm-hmm. - Good evening, parents. How you doing tonight? This is Coach Randy, and what he's passing out is the schedule for this summer. I know it's a little aggressive, but with this being their last AAU season, we want to get them as much exposure as possible. What you will also find in there is the payment schedule. Now, those of you played with us before, and I can't express this enough, it's very important that you get your payments paid on time. These tournaments have to be paid for in advance, so if you don't make that payment on time, it creates a lot of problems, okay? Now, if you can't make that payment on time, just please come and talk to me, let me know. Do you have any questions? - Are there gonna be any more fundraisers this year? - Yes, we are. And Coach Randy will getting with you to let you know. - What about playing time? I don't wanna drive four hours, just to see my son play for five minutes. - Now, that's a good question. - Listen... This is competitive basketball, not reg ball, okay? We're here to teach your kids how to play the game of basketball, and help prepare them for college. Our motto here is, work hard, get better. Those who work the hardest and play the smartest, will be rewarded with playing time, it's that simple. Is there any other questions? Okay, I appreciate you guys coming out tonight. And we'll see you guys at the game next weekend. Alright, thank you. - [David] Coach, Coach Dylan? - Yes? - I wanted to follow up with that conversation that we had yesterday. - Yes, what's on your mind? - Erm, I'm feeling like Mike is being held back from playing his game. - How so, David? - Okay, let's say for instance yesterday. He hit a three at a crucial point in the game, and you took him out, I didn't understand that. - Yes, he did hit a three in a crucial part of the game. But, he also was being a ball hog and showboat, when I asked him to run a specific play. (laughs) - A ball hog? I really don't think that's a fair assessment of what my son's been doing, he's been taking control of the game. - David, the boy was being guarded by two defenders, he had a man wide open and he chose to just keep trying to score, because he was trying to impress you. I saw him looking the stands at you. - So are you saying my son is not allowed to showcase his skills? - What am I saying is, he's a part of the team, and I'm the Coach, if I ask him to do something, that's what I expect him to do. Look David, your son is a leader when he's out there on the floor. I need him to be able to follow directions. - Hmm. - Look David, I know what you want for your son man. I want that for him and all these other boys out there too. But they gotta go about doing it the right way, or else we all lose. Look, look, I'm sorry man. I gotta get ready for practice, but if you wanna-- - No, no, no, we're fine. I hear you loud and clear. - Marie, Marie? Hey, thanks for coming tonight. I just wanna know how Tywan's doing in summer school? - Alright, I guess, why? Well, if he maintains a 2.5, then he'll be back on track for college. A lot of colleges-- - Oh, ah, ah, ah. That boy ain't going to no college, okay? So I'ma need for you to stop filling his head with all this foolishness. He lucky I let him play basketball. I only do that so his dumb butt stay out of trouble. - Look, now wait a minute, Marie. Tywan is not dumb and he has a good chance of getting a full-ride scholarship. (laughing) - Whatever, you just stick to coaching, let me worry about Tywan's schooling. College. (laughing) (gentle music) (whistle blows) - Alright fellas, line it up. (whistle blows) Bring it in, bring it in, bring it in. Alright, have a seat. Do you guys understand what chemistry is? Yes Alex. - [Alex] Isn't it like, what Coach Randy had with Moe's Mom? - Hey, shut up! - Alex, get on the line and give me five wind sprints. - [Alex] Are you a sad-- - Now! Go! Does anybody else have anything else smart to say? - [All] No Coach. - Now as I was saying. Chemistry is the interaction of one personality with another. It's a sympathetic understanding. Chemistry is what makes a good team great. Now, I think you guys have a great opportunity of doing something really big this year. You guys got all the talent in the world, but if you don't come together and start playing as one unit, your talent means nothing. I got you guys signed up to play in some of the best tournaments in the country, with some of the best teams in the nation. And I honestly feel like you guys have what it takes to go the distance. But if you don't stop goofing off with each other, and fighting amongst each other, you're going to lose. Fellas, look around you, look. The men you see around you, they're your team, your family. We don't just bring you guys here just to run you. We bring you guys here because we care, and we wanna see you do big things in life. Like go to college, do something productive with yourself. And stop fighting amongst each other. But you gotta want it and you got be able to work for it. And stop fighting amongst each other. You understand? - [All] Yes Coach. - Now we got a tournament next weekend, and I promise you that if you miss any practices from now until then, you won't play. It's that simple. You got me? - [All] Yes Coach. - Alright, bring it in, come on. (clapping) Warriors on three, one, two, three. - [All] Warriors! - T, you got a ride? - [Tywan] Yeah, Moe's dropping me off. - Okay. (sighs) - Well, I think everything went pretty well. The parents all seem to be on board. What you think Coach? - Man, I though it was cool. - Yeah. - So, what's up with you and Candy? - What? What you talking about? - Candy, Moe's Mom. Come on Randy, don't play me like that man. I saw you over there talking to her. Man, please tell me you're not messing around with that woman. - No Coach, I ain't messing with her. We was just talking. - Randy, you know I know you better than that right? You know, dealing with these kids is hard enough. And then dealing with their parents make it even harder. I can't have you complicating things man, by messing around with these kids mamas. Look man, don't crap where you eat. This world way too big for you to be trolling around these player's mama pool for women. - Okay. I hear you. - I mean it Randy. - Okay. - How's it going? - It's going. - Okay, what do you mean by that? - I don't know how we're going to make it to nationals. - Ah, you say that every year, and every year, God provides a way. - Yeah, you right. - And since we're on the subject of blessings, one of my co-workers is looking for a team for her son. You remember Dana Hart? Yeah, he's 17. He's a guard, he used to play with the Dragons. - Well, if he's so good, why isn't he still playing with the Dragons? - Well, he kinda got into it with his Coach and got kicked off the team. And he... - And what? (sighs) - He's had some run-ins with the law. (laughs) Dylan, don't laugh. This is a single mother we're talking about. She's at her wits end with her son. She says he's really not a bad kid at heart, he just has some pent up frustration and he doesn't know how to deal with it the right way. And on top of that he hangs around the wrong crowd. Dylan, she really believes he has the potential to do something great, if he just gets put in the right situation. And I think that situation could be with the Warriors. - What are you trying to do to me woman? I already got 10 and that's pushing it. - Come on Dylan. I'm not asking you to say yes right away, just think about it. Honey, look, you really have a way with those boys and I tell you, when she started talking to me, I knew right then, that God sent her to talk to me for a reason. Come on, think about it. - I'll think about it, but I'm not making any promises. So don't get your hopes up. - Okay, that's all I can ask. Thank you baby. And don't forget about the doctor's appointment tomorrow. - Yeah I know, 3 o'clock sharp. - Uh-huh. - I got it. - Attaboy. (distant shouting) (upbeat music) - Be patient, you ain't gotta force nothing. Come on. Alright, alright Mike, good job boy. Now get back, get back, let's go, let's go. - Move it Mike. - Come on Dewey, let's go baby. (cheering) Great job, great work, great work. Good job boys, good job. Man, way to go get it. Alright, line up, line up, line up, line up. Come on, come on. Great job fellas. (clapping) Great job, yeah. Good job, boy. - [Randy] Work it, work it, work it. - Bring it in, bring it in. Hey fellas, great game man, great game. (clapping) Hey, what I saw out there today was team basketball. I mean, we had a few weak moments, but you guys recovered quickly. And overall, I'm very proud of you guys man. Hey, moved the ball around and we executed. Great job fellas. - [Randy] Oh yes. - Hey, you know what? And to celebrate, I'm taking you all out for some pizza. (cheering) - Let's go, let's go. Let's go. - Up top, up top baby. - Hey, hey. - Hey, good game today man. - You too man. Hey, you might be on my level yet. - Oh yeah, whatever. (distant chattering) - Hey Dad, what's up? - What was that? - What you talking about? We won. - But you only scored, like 10 points. You shoulda at least scored 20 by my calculations. It's like every time you grab the ball, you just looking to pass. - But Dad, we won, everybody played good. - I didn't come here to see everybody play good. I came here to see my son play good. Now let's go. - But Dad, Coach is taking everybody out to celebrate. - Celebrate that lackluster performance? No, you need to go home and work on your game. - Come on, Dad. - Do you wanna play college ball? - You know I wanna play college-- - Well, you gotta do whatever it takes to make that happen. And that means sacrifice. - But Dad, I just wanna celebrate with my team. - Celebrate with your team or perfect your craft? - Hey Mike, we waiting on you, you coming? - Nah man, I got work to do. ("Jesus on my Mind" by Da Church) (distant chattering) - [Scotty] Hey Coach, you gonna have to get Red a booster seat, you know he can't see over the table? (laughing) Little fella. - Ha, ha, but I was tall enough to reach the door knob to let your mama out last night. - Hey. - Hey man, I told you man. You don't talk about my mama, yo. - Hey fellas, listen up. Y'all gotta quit with them mama jokes. It's disrespectful. Now, we're here to celebrate a great game today. So, just be quiet and enjoy your food, alright? Right. - Hey Coach, I'm sorry, my bad. - Yeah Coach, he's sorry. - Red. - Okay Coach, I've been meaning to tell you. I'm happy for you and your wife, you know, about the baby and all. But I've been praying that this baby don't come out with your head, 'cause you got a big watermelon head. - Hey, yo dawg, this dude disrespectful man. Yo, what's wrong with your manners? - He can't even hold it above his shoulders, he be like this, ah, help me up. (laughing) - That's really funny. I bet you the memory of that joke will keep you company when you sitting on the bench during the next game. - [All] Ooo. - Oh, oh, no need to get personal Coach. Look at his face Coach, look at his hair Coach, come on. - Knock it off, knock it off boy. You, you just be talking a little too much. - Hey, seriously Coach, what's up with Mike? - What do you mean? - I mean, his Dad won't ever let him hang out with us. What's up with that? - Yeah. - I don't know. Something you'd have to ask Mike about. - I'm saying though, he act like he's so much better than the rest of the team or something. - Yeah. - Look here fellas. We're here to celebrate a great game today. Those who can make it are here. Those who couldn't, or chose not to, are not. And if you wanna know why Mike ain't here tonight, that's something you'd have to ask him. 'Cause only he can answer that question for you. You feel me? - Yes Coach. - [All] Yes Coach. - Hey, you guys looked really good out there today man. Seriously, keep playing like that and we're not gonna mess about and win us a championship trophy. (cheering) (shouting over each other) What are we? - [All] Warriors! - [Dylan] What are we? - [All] Warriors! - [Dylan] What do we do? - [All] Work hard, get better! - [Dylan] What do we do? - [All] Work hard, get better! (cheering) - Alright Coach, thanks for the pizza and the ride. - No problem, T. - Alright - T, wait up. (rustling) - What's this for? - Swimming. Man, what do you think they're for? Go ahead and open them. See if they're the right size. Well, are they the right size? - I can't take these. - Why not? You need new shoes. You been working hard out there on the court. And I also had a long talk with your teacher and she tell me you've really been applying yourself. Hey, you deserve it, man, go ahead. - I can't. - T, you need new shoes man. I can't have you out there playing in shoes that are falling apart and not giving you the proper support. Look man, it's okay. We all need help sometimes. It's cool man. Take 'em man, they're yours. - Thanks Coach. - Hey, I told you man, I'm here for you. All I wanna see you is succeed in life. That's all. - Thanks Coach. - See you tomorrow man. - See you tomorrow Coach. Thank you. (gentle music) - 34 points that man scored in that last game. - Oh. - That's exceptional, exceptional. He should be doing big things. - Yes, he should do. (mumbles) Well if that's what it takes. - Well, well, well. If it ain't the man of the hour. (laughing) We were just talking about you. - Sure was. Hey baby. Listen, Mr. Stoney here was just telling me how much of a great player you are. - That's right. But, I told him he wasn't telling me nothing I didn't already know. Come on baby, sit on down. - Nah, I'm good. I'm actually really tired, I'm gonna go lay down. - Ah, boy, get over here. This nice man came all the way over here to talk to you. The least you can do is hear what he has to say. Hmm, go ahead Mr. Stoney. - Look son, I know it's been a long day, I understand, so I'ma cut straight to the chase. I've been watching you play for a minute now and I like how you get down. You know I run the Infinity Squad and I want you to come play for me. Look, I know you play for the Warriors, I know you like playing for the Warriors, but at this point in your high school career, it's time for you to start thinking about your future. You know, college, NBA. - Like you said, I'm happy where I'm at. (laughing) - Son, the Warriors are good. They good, they alright, yeah. But the Infinity Squad is the best, the elite. We got sponsors to pay for all our equipment, uniforms, shoes, even travel. And all you have to do is show up and play. - Whey, I like the sound of that. Huh, because I'm tired of them calling me to do all them fundraisers. Now you did say pay for everything? - Oh yeah, everything. And all you have to do is show up and play. Give it some thought Tywan. Come to one of our, matter of fact you can come to our next practice. - Look, I'm sorry Mr. Stoney, but I'm not interested in playing for you or anyone else. But thanks for stopping by. - Alright. (sighs) - What the. Excuse him, I will talk to him. - It's okay, I'm sure he'll come around. All my information is on there. Give it to him, whenever he ready, we'll be ready for him. - Oh, okay, well thanks for stopping by. - Thank you, thank you for your time, take care. - [Marie] You have a good day. - [Stoney] You too. Alright. - What is your problem? - Nothing, I'm fine where I'm at. - I don't think you know who you talking to. But I make all the decisions around here. - Mama, I don't wanna play for them. I don't even know them. The Warriors is my team and that's where I wanna be. - This ain't about loyalty. Wake up Tywan! This about doing what you gotta do. This about going as far as you can go, and getting what you can get out of it. Now they talking about paying for everything. What are the Warriors doing for you, huh? - The Warriors got me where I'm at. Coach Dylan's the one who helped me work on my game, and I encouraged me to do better at school, so I can go to college. - College? Boy you better get your head out the clouds! The only way you're going to college is with a basketball tied around your stupid neck. You ain't book smart, Tywan. And if this man can pay for everything in order for you to play basketball and possibly get people looking at you, then that's what needs to happen, end of story. Besides, he said he was gonna pay extra on the rent next month, okay? And he has the hook up in making sure you pass that ACT test to qualify you for college. Now, I don't see the Warriors doing any of that around here, do you? Yeah, I didn't think so. Now, you're going to that practice. And if they'll have you, you gonna play for that team. And I don't wanna hear nothing else about it. You understand? - Yeah Mama. (sighs) (beeping) (gentle music) - Lora? Where are you? Lora? Hey, honey, where are you? What's wrong baby? - Oh, Dylan. - What's wrong. - It hurts so bad, please. Just call the doctor. - Okay, okay. (breathing heavily) Breathe baby. Ah, shoot. Look, we need to get you to the car. Do you want me to carry you? Walk? - No, no, I can walk. - Okay, come on, take your time, take your time. - Oh, it hurts. - Come on baby, it's gonna be okay. - Mr. Baxter? - Hey doc, how's she doing? Is the baby okay? - Yes Mr. Baxter, your wife is doing fine, and your baby is doing fine as well, for now. - What do you mean for now? - She's suffering from a condition called placental abruption, which means that the placenta is separating from the uterine lining. It's caused by abnormalities inside here uterus. Now, right now, there is only a partial separation, but if it gets any worse, it will result in us having to take the baby early. Which wouldn't be good because she's only in her 29th week, and that would not be good for the baby. - Well, what does that mean? What can we do about it? - For the time being, I'm placing her on strict bed rest. She should stay off her feet as much as possible so that we can try to minimize the chances of any further separation. - Okay, well, I mean, can I go see her? - Of course. (monitor beeping) - How you feeling? - Like a couple of horses kicked me in the stomach and then trampled it a few times. - That bad, huh? - Yeah. So I guess this means no more fun for me for a while, huh? (gentle music) - Well, look at the bright side. You get to be waited on hand and foot now, until you deliver. - Yippee, cue the band. - Look, I talked to your mom and she said she will be here in a day. She'll stay as long as we need her to. - I'm so scared Dylan. - Me too. But no matter what, we gotta trust that God will see us through this. - But what if God sees fit to take our child? I don't know if I can handle that. - Baby, don't think like that. All we can do is pray and take each day as it comes. Okay? (sighs) - Okay. (mumbles) - Come on, hey, stretch. Slow it down. Oh well, well. Now ain't you a sight for sore eyes. I'm glad to see you made the choice to come to the winner's circle. - Thank you, Mr. Stoney. We appreciate the opportunity. - No, no, no, it's us who appreciates you. Look son, we got your gear and your uniform over here all set up for you. Ms. Thomas-- - Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Call me Marie. - Okay, Marie. Well Marie, if you go over here and see my man John, he got all the necessary paperwork and forms we need for you to sign. So we can get the ball rolling. T-Money. - My name's Tywan. - My bad. T-Money, if you wanna jump in the drills and warm-ups, we figure how we can get you into rotation. - He's just nervous. He don't take well to change. Go, now. Go now Tywan, go. - Ms. Thomas, Marie? - Mm-hmm? - If... Maybe we can get up a little bit, if Mama wasn't over here angry with him. So have you got some errands to run, or something you might have to do, I could drop him off after practice. - Oh, is that right? And you don't mind? - Not at all, not at all. - Well, if you're sure. Then I guess I'll see you later on this evening. - No worries, everything gonna be fine, trust me. - Alright now. (mumbles) - Oh man, you dirty-- - [Randy] Hey fellas. Hustle up, come on, bring it in. Well, looks like Coach Dylan's gonna be off for a little bit. So y'all stuck with me. - Great. - What was that? Is there a problem? - Nah man. - So where's Coach? - Well Coach got some personal business to take care of, and if he wanna tell us about it when he gets back, then that's what he'll do. But until then, it's business as usual. Hey, where's T? - I don't know. I called him to see if he needed a ride and he didn't answer. He never called me back. - Alright, well y'all already know, one monkey don't stop no show. But we got a game this weekend, and we can't have no L's for Coach to come back to. - Now that's right. - Alright, so let's get it. Warriors on three. One, two, three. - [All] Warriors. - [Randy] Let's go. (whistle blows) (clapping) Come on. - Our little baby boy alright? - Uh-huh. He's gonna be doing jumping Jacks. He's doing good. - How's my baby feeling? - Oh, I'm fine Ma. - Good, good. Oh, Dylan, run in the kitchen and grab here drink for me, it's on the counter. - Yes, Ma'am, I'll be right back. - Alright. There you go. I made you some good old, homemade chicken noodle soup. And your favorite biscuits and honey. That ought to get Grandma's baby acting right in there, right? - Hmm, mm, mm, mm. Not bad. (phone vibrating) - Hey, what's going on D? How's it going? - Much better man, Wifey's doing better. Mother's here now, so she's practically taken over the house. - [Diane] I heard that. - Man, she got ears like a bat. - Man, tell me about it. So how did the practice go today? - Well everything is cool. Except for T didn't show up. The other guys said they haven't heard from him either. - Mm... That's not like him. But okay, I'll give him a call. - But yeah, other than than, we're ready for the weekend. - Yeah, I'm gonna do my best to make it. But I'll have to keep you posted on that. But hey, in the meantime, I might have us another new player. - A project player? - That's what I'm told. - What position does he play? (laughs) - Another guard. - Yippee, look, whatever you decide. You know I'm down. You know how we do it man. Rack 'em up, raise 'em right. - That's right. Alright bro, well, I'm gonna give Tywan a call real quick, so I'll let you know how that goes, okay? - Alright, bye. (phone vibrating) (sighs) (phone alert rings) (sighs) - Ah, man. (clapping) - Oh man, yo what's up Coach? - Yo man, what's up, how's it going? - It's good to see you man. - It's good to see you bro. - Hey, how's Wifey? - I think she's doing a lot better. - Yeah. - Mom's been a big help for us man. - That's good. - They practically kicked me out. - Oh, no way. - Diane, tell me I'm all in her way. (laughing) So there you go. But hey, I'm here. - You are. - So what's going on? - Well, you know, since T's gone, it puts Eric in his spot. I been chasing after Mike's tail. He be after showboating again. - Dad been in his ear? - It looks that way. He was doing good at first. But then all of sudden Mr. Run-and-gun show up. - Hey, don't worry about it, we'll see. - Hey, any word from Tywan? - No man, I'm not worried about him either. - Okay. - [Player] Hey Coach, how you doing? (buzzing) - Alright fellas, listen up. We're gonna start the game with Red, Mike, Alex, Dewey and Eric, okay? - Yo Coach, what happened to T? - I don't know and now's not the time to worry about it. Hey listen up, this team is undefeated. So we're gonna start right out the gate and play full-court, man to man. Now, it's really important that we work the ball around and take good shots, okay? - [Player] Yes Coach. - Alright? - [Player] Let's go. - Now look, this team is very disciplined. So we gotta go out there, we gotta play smart, and create some opportunities, okay? Alright, let's bring it in, come on fellas. (clapping) Warriors on three, one, two, three. - [All] Warriors! (clapping) (cheering) (upbeat music) (distant shouting) - Alright Mike, Mike, nice one. Now get back, get back, come on baby, come on. Mike, what are you doing man? Use your team, Alex was wide open. What's wrong with you? Come on man. - See Coach, that's what I'm talking about. Man, he already fooling. - Mike, where you going, where you going? Time out, time out, time out. Get in here, come on. What did I say at the beginning of the game? (mumbling) I said run the play and work the ball around. I didn't say play tiddlywinks with the basketball, and get caught up with three defenders. Mike, you're out. - But Coach, I just made both my free throws. - That's not the point. You're not following directions. If you can't follow directions, I put someone in to get the job done. Scotty, check in. (banging) Listen up. - That was a good game, yo. (laughs) He's up in his thing, like this. (distant chattering) - Why would you even come to a game looking like that. - Yo, give me something to eat, go get that pizza. - Hey, get your butt home boy. (distant chattering) - I came through on the clutch though, that's how I do. That's it, you know it. (laughs) - Well I'll be a monkey's uncle. - [Randy] Well, ain't this some bull. - Hey Coach, I see you got yourself another victory out there, keep up the good work. - Come on Coach, let me get him Coach. - Red, it ain't worth it, let's go. - He ain't talking like that Coach. - Let's go, let's go. Go, it ain't worth it. Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go. Come on. T, T, what's going on man, why you with them? - Not now, Moe. - What do you mean, not now? You walk in here with another squad and don't say nothing to nobody and you wanna tell me, not now? - Like I said, not now, Moe. - [Player] Like he said, not now, Moe. - Oh really? - Hey son, good game alright. Don't sweat it. That Coach has no idea what he's doing and I'm tired of him holding you back. But it's good to see you unafraid to go hard out there. See, he doesn't understand that a high-profile player like yourself has to do what he has to do to get noticed. But don't worry about it. I've taken care of everything. Let's go. (gentle music) - What's wrong with you now? - Told you I didn't wanna play for that team. - Well what happened? What happened Tywan? Pfft. (sighs) (phone vibrating) - Hello? - You ready to talk now? - Talk about what? I decided to play for a different team, end of story. - T, who you trying to fool? You know I know you better than that. We go way too far back for you to try to play me. - Yeah, whatever. - Oh, so you mean to tell me you just woke up, decided to go play for the Infinity Squad without letting Coach, the team, or me know? After all Coach has done for you man. Are you just gonna leave him hanging like that without a word? - It's not even like that. I found a better situation for me, and I don't want no drama, that's all. - No drama? Is that what you call walking into a game-day situation, when you never officially quit your old team. That's not dramatic to you? I don't know what kind of BS that Stoney dude been feeding you, but you need to check yourself. - It's not like that. Moe, on a real bro, you need to think about come rolling with us. I mean we got sponsors so everything's paid for. And they got college coaches looking at all their players. It would be a good look for you. Hey, I could talk to Stoney for you? - I ain't trying to hear that, T! If you wanna turn your back on your boys and the people who've been in your corner pulling for you since day one, then do you, but I don't get down like that. And never in a million years would I have thought you did either if hadn't seen it with my own eyes. It would have been different if you stepped to Coach like a man and told him what was going on, but you didn't, you went behind everybody's back sneaking around like a little punk. - Man, I ain't no punk. - Yeah, whatever dude, enjoy your new team. (sighs) (knocking) - Come in. - Hello, Coach Dylan? - Yes. Justin, right? - Yes sir. - Sir, huh? Hmm. Okay, come on in and sit down. So your mom tells me you're looking for a new team to play with this year. What's that all about? - I mean, with my last coach, we kinda got into it. - Kinda got into it. Like how? (sighs) - Well, he started going in on me at practice and then he put his hands on me and I just lost it. - So, put his hands on you like how, to hurt you? - No, like he grabbed my shoulder, because he was yelling at me and I was walking away. - I see. So your mom also tells me that you been in trouble with the law. (sighs) Well? - I mean, I got arrested once for trying to sell some weed. Our electricity got shut off and I tried to get a job to help my mom out, but nobody would hire me. So I tried to get the money that way. - I see. You got anger issues? - Sometimes. - You still selling drugs? - No sir. - So, what makes you think I should let you play for this team? - I'm a good ball player, I'm willing to work hard and just become a better person. I'm not saying that you should let me play for your team. I know I made some bad decisions, but all I'm asking for is a chance. (sighs) - Okay. I'm going to give you one shot, on a trial basis. You mess up, you backtalk, you put your hands on anybody, or you even get caught out there doing anything against the law again, you're done. Is that understood? - Yes Coach. - Alright well, we start practice in 30 minutes, so go in the locker room and get dressed, and I'll meet you out on the court, and introduce you to the team, then we'll go from there. - Ah man, thank you Coach. Thank you. (sighs) - [Randy] Come on let's go. There we go. (clapping) Yeah. Good job. Yo, come on, round it up. Hustle. - What's up fellas? - [All] What's up Coach? - How you all doing today? - [All] Yeah, good. - Where's Moe at? - [All] Haven't seen him. - You seen Moe? - No Coach, I ain't seen him either. Well okay, I wanna introduce you guys to Justin. He's a guard and he's gonna be playing with us. - [Randy] Okay. - [Dylan] Hey, introduce yourself to him and make him feel welcome fellas. - Why'd you do it? - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. - Hey, chill man, what's wrong with you? - Why'd you do it? - Okay, chill, chill. - Moe, man you don't understand. - You don't understand what? - Yeah, why don't you tell him Coach Randy? Why don't you tell everybody how you got my mama pregnant, you dirty-- - Hey, get him outta here, get him outta here fellas. Get him outta here, get him chilled out. - [Alex] Come on, come on, chill, chill, chill, come on. - Look Coach, I didn't mean for it to happen like this. - Man, get out. - Come on Coach, here me out. - Now's not the time or the place. Get out now. (somber music) Alright fellas, shows over, let's work. Come on, let's go. (whistle blows) (gentle music) - Hey Mike, did you forget something? - Nah Coach, I just wanted to talk to you for a minute. - Yeah, sure, come on over. Is everything okay? What's on your mind? - Erm, I wanna let you know that today will be my last day of practice with the Warriors. My Dad's moved me to another team. - Okay, I see. Is that what you want? Well, is it? - I mean, I wanna shine. I just wanna go to school and play ball. And it's my last year at AAU. I need to do whatever I gotta do to get D1 attention. My Dad... No, I don't think I can do that here. - I see. Well in that case Mike, I wish you the best man. You know, it took a lot of guts for you to come over here and talk to me like a man, and tell me about the decision you made. You know Mike, sometimes you gotta make decisions in life, that's either gonna help you or hurt you. But at the end of the day, the decisions you make, only you have to deal with them. - I don't like it, but I respect it, and you. I hope you find what you're looking for Mike. - Thanks Coach. - Hey, and just 'cause you're leaving it don't change a thing. I'm here if you need me. All I wanna see is you succeed in life. (crickets chirping) - Come on D, hear me out. - For what? So you can lie some more? Man, I told you not to mess around with that woman. And the situation we got right now is exactly why. - I know man, but you don't understand. - What I understand is, not only did you lie and go behind my back, you also went behind Moe back and mess around with his Mama. And you got her pregnant. Man, how do you think that make him feel and look in front of his team? How do you think that make us look as an organization? And we're supposed to be role models for these young men. - I'm sorry D. But it's not like that, I love her. We been seeing each other for a while now. We tried to keep it a secret, but things just start happening so fast. - Man, Mike quit the team today. - Straight up? Why? - He said he had to do what he had to do to attract D1 attention. Look Randy, I know what you're saying is probably true and all, but I can't except that type of behavior from a coach in this organization. And we're supposed to be setting examples for these young men. You know what? I'ma have to let you go man. (gentle music) - [Lora] Dylan, what's wrong? - How's my baby? How's my baby doing? (sighs) - He's doing good. How's his daddy doing? Dylan you look like you just lost your best friend. - Dylan, do you want me to make you something to eat? - No thanks Mama D, I'm not hungry right now. - Dylan, what's wrong? - Where do I start? Well the good news is, Dana's son started with us today. On a trial basis. So we'll see how that all shapes out. - Well that is good news. I'm sure Dana will be happy to hear that. - And just as I'm introducing Justin to the team. Moe comes running in and jumps on Randy, for messing with his mother. - What? - What? - Oh, it gets worse. He got her pregnant. - [Both] What? - Oh. (laughs) There's more to it. Mike comes to me after practice and tells me he's going to play for another team so he can get his shine on. And, just before I walk in the house, I had to let Randy go. So yeah, today's been a pretty messed up day for me. Not to mention Nationals is just a couple of weeks away. (sighs) Still gotta get that money for that. It's just like everything is falling apart on me right now. - Well now, Dylan have you talked to God to see what He has to say about the situation? - Mama D, I ain't had a chance to talk to no one. I mean, this all just happened. - Come on, get up. Let's join hands and we are going to go to the Lord in prayer. - [Lora] You alright there? (gentle music) - [Diane] Alright. Dear Heavenly Father, we come to you with humble hearts, seeking your wisdom in our time of need. Father, I ask that you would bless Dylan and Lora, and the child in her womb, that he may come forth a healthy and happy baby. I ask that you would walk with Dylan as he seeks Your will with mentoring these young men. Give them strength God. Give them Your grace and Your mercy. And help them to trust you, Lord, in all things, even those that they may not understand. We ask these blessings in Jesus mighty name, amen. - [Both] Amen. - [Diane] It's gonna be alright. - [Dylan] Thank you. - Put it on my schedule for Tuesday and I'll close it. Yeah. No problem. Bye. How did things go with your coach? - He's pretty cool about it. - Good, heard about Coach Randy. Got a call from one of the parents on my way over here. - Yeah, Moe's pretty upset. - Yeah, well it just confirms that we're doing the right thing. You need to be part of a team that has scandals like that surrounding it, it just doesn't look good. Talked to your new coach. He's really excited about you coming to the team. It's more of a fit for you, alright? They have a tournament coming up this weekend, so you can start practicing with them next week. But until then, I'll do your workouts. - Yes sir. - That's my boy. Hey, I know it's tough on you right now, but we're doing the right thing. You'll see, alright? (upbeat music) - [Stoney] Hello. Hustle, hustle, hustle. Come on man. Let's go, hustle Matthew, come on more. (distant shouting) Time out. (whistle blows) Hurry up and sit down! Stop playing like some little punks out there. We should be blowing this team out. - Man you tripping, if you put somebody in the game like that too, this big dumb fool right here. - Who the hell you talking to? - I'm talking to you-- - Shut up, I'm talking! You stupid little monkeys out there, you all better start playing some ball. You making me look bad in front of my people. Now, I don't care what you do when you get out there, you better not loose, do you hear me? Get off my bench. I see homeboy out there stalling you out. Next time he do you up, you pinch him inside his thigh so the ref don't see it, that way you can get around him. - What? - Did you, did I stutter? - I don't get down like that. - Oh, you don't get down like that? Hey, hey, hey, Doug? Or Stick, check in for T-Money since he ain't in the right frame of mind to play this post. (banging) I kick chairs too. (gentle music) - Alright fellas, listen up. I wanted to bring you guys here tonight, because there's been a lot going on lately, that we obviously need to talk about. First, I just wanted to let you guys know that Coach Randy is no longer a part of this organization. - [All] What? - I know, just calm down, bear with me and let me finish. Second, Mike is no longer with the team. - Come on. - He came and told me after last practice. And as we all know Tywan is now running with the Infinity Squad. So with that being said, we obviously have some major adjustments to make. Bur as you all know, one man don't make a team, but by the same token, every man plays an important role on any team. Fortunately, God is in control and He never makes mistakes. We still got all the key players we need, and I am very thankful for each and every one of you guys. But before I move any further, I just want to know, does anyone else have anything to say? Does... Anyone else wanna leave the team? - I'm a Warrior for life Coach. - For life. - [All] For life. - Hey Coach, I know I'm new, but the way I see it, you took a chance on me, so that make me a Warrior too. (sighs) - Thank you guys. Well, now that we gotten that all out the way. The national tournament's only two weeks away. - [All] Yeah. - Hey, we still got a lot to work on. - Yeah. - Not to mention the money we still need to raise for our travel expenses. But I'm not worried. As you all know, I'm a man of God and I try very hard to run this organization in a manner that reflects that. My biggest mistake has been not involving him enough, and relying on my own resources and ability to make things happen, when ultimately without Him, we're nothing. So going forward, I'm gonna do everything in my power to make sure God is a prominent part in everything we do. Because without Him, we're nothing. In spite of everything that we've been through, He's seen fit to bring each and every one of us together, for a purpose. And I'm very excited about that fellas. So going forward, all we gotta do is continue to work hard, and prepare for what lies ahead, and trust Him to make a way. - Amen, Coach. - Hey, let's bring it in fellas, come on.

(mumbles) This is Mike. You ready to get that money? - Yeah, he's ready to get his money, that's exactly what we been talking about. He's been held back a little bit, if you know what I mean, but he has a lot of potential man. I'm really looking for a team that can really shine. And he's a great shooter, he's a great defender, so happy to be part of this team man. - [Stoney] Let's get this money. - Get this money, that's what I wanna talk about. - That's what I mean. - Let's get this money, that's what I'm interested in. (laughing) (distant chattering) (soft music) - What up, T? - [Stoney] I don't like to pinch 'em, but I will. - Hey, the last team he was on didn't even have shoes to play in man. - [Stoney] They didn't have a lot of money? - [David] Embarrassing. - Come on buddy, hustle. - Hey T. Hey T. Hey T, hold up man. - What do you want? What are you even doing here? - Man, I could ask you the same thing. - Hey, you stopped me, we ain't gotta talk. - Look man, you really need to learn how to loosen up, for real. My Dad brought me over here. He thinks that I can play better if I'm out of my box more with another team. - Yeah? Well everything that glitters ain't gold. - What do you mean? - You'll see. It's a whole different world over here. - I can see that, with all the shoe sponsorships and stuff. Plus the Infinity Squad gets a lot of exposure. - Like I said, everything that glitters ain't gold. - Look man, can we just call a truce? I mean, I know I said some messed up stuff to you in the past, but I really don't mean nothing by it. I mean, why don't we just bygones be bygones, and make it do what it do. We already got good court chemistry. I mean you wanna win right? (sighs) - Hey Ma. - Hey. How was practice? - I'm not going back. (keyboard tapping) (knocking) - Come in. (sighs) - Hey D, what's going on? - Hey, erm, nothing. What's going on with you? - I could be better, but I won't complain. - Hmm. Why don't ya come in and have a seat. - Thank you. (soft music) - What's on your mind? - I just... I just wanted to come over here and apologize to you for my behavior. We've been coaching together for five years. Been friends longer than that. I hate what I did, and I love coaching those boys. I want you to know that what you did was right. But I also need you to know that that weren't just some jump off type of situation. Man, I love her. And I wanna be with her. - Look Randy, you ain't gotta explain that-- - No listen, just let me finish. Just let me finish. I went over to Candy's house to talk to her. And I had a long conversation with Moe. I told him that I apologize for not being up front with him about the situation. I told him that I love his mother and that I wanna be there for her, and him. He had a hard time taking it at first. But he's started to come around after his mother told him that she felt the same way. Look Coach, I'm not telling you all of this for you to take me back. I really just wanna make the situation right. - I appreciate that man. (sighs) - I also wanted to give you this. - What is this? - It's a donation. I know you and the guys have been doing fundraisers to raise money for the trip and I just wanna do my part. I know how it can be. - Randy, this is $5000 man. You about to have baby. Man, I can't take this. - You can and you will. Look, I liquidated some of my 401k, so it's not gonna hurt me. Plus it's the least that I can do. Just let me do this, please. - Thank you man. - Just don't tell 'em it's from me. Okay, if that's what you want. - It is. Look man... - Hey. We both about to be daddy's. - I know, and I'm scared to death. - Don't be man. You will be okay. We both will. - Thanks. (clapping) - [Dylan] Last shooter? - Me Coach. - Alright. Alright, alright, bring it in fellas, bring it in, bring it in. (clapping) Hey, great job out there fellas. I must say, the way you all been looking lately, we might mess around and win us a trophy this year. (cheering) Alright, alright, quiet down, listen up. I got us some great news for y'all. Due to the blessings of a generous donor, we now have the full $5000 we need for Nationals! (cheering) - Woo, let's go Coach. (talking over each other) - Hello? Back at the hospital? Oh, no, no, here I come now, okay, alright? Hey Red, lock it up, lock it up, I'll talk to you later. - Oh god. Why? (sobbing) - Shh, it's okay, it's okay. - I just want my baby. - I know, I know, we are gonna get you to the bed. - Oh god. (mumbles) (sobbing) - It's okay baby. - Oh god. - What can I do for you? - Just leave me alone, oh god. Oh god. (slow dramatic music) - I don't know what to do. - Dylan. - I don't know what to do. I can't fix this Mama. Why would God take our baby from us, huh? Why would he do that to us? - Dylan baby, nobody can answer that question. But we know that everything works according to His will, and I know, I know that it's not always easy to accept. But-- - But what? My wife is in there crying her eyes out. Over the loss of our baby, who we've waited so long to have. And I'm supposed to just accept that? - Dylan, I know that this is hard. You have just to have faith that everything will work out for the good. - I can't accept this, I just can't. - Dylan, I... (basketball bouncing) (gentle music) (groans) - Why? Why? Why did you take my son from me man? Again! (sobbing) (sniffing) - Coach. - What you doing here? - I went by your house and your mother-in-law said I probably could find you here. I called some of the guys and... Coach, I'm sorry to hear about your baby. (sobbing) - Well, so am I. Sorry you have to see me like this. But, now's really not a good time, T. - Yeah, I know. But, I've learned the past few years, from my coach... That we all need help sometimes. - Yeah, you right about that. T, I don't know how you're gonna be able to help me with this one man. - Yeah, me neither. But Coach, I'm willing to try. I wanna play for you, if you'll have me. Look, I'm sorry how I left the team, but my mom made me do it and I couldn't face you or the guys. But I quit the Infinity Squad. I just wanna come back home Coach. (sobbing) - Come back home man. You can always come back home, T. (sobbing heavily) - [Red] Yo, if anybody ever found out I was hugged up crying with a bunch of dudes, I swear on everything I love, I'm lumping all of y'all up. - [All] Shut up Red. (sighs) - Hey. - Hey. How you feeling? - A little better. You? - I don't know, I got a lot of things going through my head right now. - Yeah, me too. Dylan, I'm sorry I sent you away. - No, don't be-- - No, no. We both lost our child, so it wasn't fair for me to push you away like that. Like I was the only one going through something. I know you're hurting too. - I'm gonna cancel the tournament. - [Lora] No. - I need to be here with you. - No you can't do that. The tournament is in three days. You can't do that to those boys. - How can I think about basketball at a time like this? - Dylan. We both know that everything happens for a reason. And those boys need you. You can't pull out on them now. - What about us? I need to be here with you? - For what? You being here is not gonna bring the baby back. We both just be staring at each other and moping around, no, I cannot let you do that. We're going. (soft music) - We? - You're going to coach your team, and I'll be in the stands cheering you on. Like a good wife is supposed to. (sighs) Oh, Dylan. We may have lost our child, but the Lord has seen fit to give you 10 more. - I guess it's settled then. We're going to Nationals. (lips smacking) (upbeat music) - Yo, what's up? It's your man J-Styles, and you know I'm always where I need to be. And today, I'm right here where I need to be, in the International Hyper Arena right here in sunny Florida, and I know what your thinking, yo Jay, is that, is that Young Buck? Yes it is man, the legendary Hip Hop icon, Young Buck is in the house, but today he's not coming as the Hip Hop icon, today he's here for the kids as a sponsor. Yo, Young Buck, tell them all about the tournament man. - Ah man, I'ma lace y'all straight up. Today's is one of the biggest tournaments that we do for the youth in basketball. Today is the fifth annual Moneyball National Basketball Tournament. It's big and I'm here in search of the baddest 17 and under squad that's out there on the court. I'm basically coming to sponsor these kids. And when I mean sponsor I'm talking about traveling, uniforms, shoes, the whole nine. - [Jay] The socks, everything. - [Young Buck] Everything, I wanna just, you know, I know it's a lot of teams that is out here trying to make ends meet, but also dealing with the financial hardship, so I just wanna come in and kind of help these kids think out the box. I mean, outside of that, we got a lot of big college scouts coming, as well as NBA scouts that are out here. So these kids can showcase their talents in front of them and possibly be able to take their talents from this court to a college court. - And then? - To the NBA court, you know, so that's the ultimate goal. (cheering) - Alright fellas, listen up. No long speeches here today. We're here to play basketball, nothing more, nothing less. Now, each game is a one game elimination all the way to the end. So y'all know what to do. We gotta play hard and take each game as it come. Alright? Let's join hands and pray. Dear Heavenly Father, we thank You Lord for this blessed fulfilled day. Lord, we ask that You walk with us Lord, and let Your light to shine down on us so that we may glorify Your name in everything we do. In Jesus name we pray, amen. - [All] Amen. (clapping and cheering) - Come on, let's go. - Alright, listen up fellas, listen up. Hey, no matter what the outcome is today, I just want you guys to know that I love you and I'm very proud of you. [All] Love you too Coach. - I love you too Coach. - So let's go out here and let's play some Warrior basketball. (cheering) - Come on, come on, come on. - Weigh us in, Alex, weigh us in baby. - [Alex] Who are we? - [All] Warriors. - [Alex] Who are we? - [All] Warriors. - [Alex] What do we do? - [All] Work hard, get better. - [Alex] What do we do? - [All] Work hard, get better. (cheering) (clapping) (upbeat hip hop music) (distant chattering) - Hold up, hold up, wait. Well, well, well, if it ain't the long lost T-Money. How you doing bro? Nah for real, what's up bro? Oh, it's like that? Okay, that's what's up, we all know you the choker that's on the team anyway. (laughing) But dig this though, we gonna keep moms on speed dial. (shouting over each other) - Hey yo, hey yo, hey you. chill out, chill out yo. Hey, yo, don't even sweat it. We'll get this one later, after he get his teeth fixed. Looking like he got hit in the mouth with a bag of gravel. (laughing) - [Dante] That was lame, that was lame. - What? Y'all don't want none of this man. - Check this out, y'all need to practice. Go ahead, Warriors. - Let's go man. - Don't worry about them man. - Hey bro, follow through. Okay, follow through. - [Justin] See you on the court bro. - [Dante] Warriors, ha, ha. - Hey yo, Mike? Is this really what you want man? (distant chattering) (gentle music) (laughs) - I gotta admit, I didn't see that coming. You know what D, I wanna thank you. I got a lot of good players from you this year. Too bad your boy Tywan didn't work out. I see how he came crawling back to you after he couldn't handle the pressure of playing with an elite squad. It's all good though, Mike's working out much better. Yeah. - You know Stoney, you have yourself a good game. (giggles) - Hmm. (cheering) (dramatic music) - Alright fellas, this is it. You guys fought hard to get here, and now it's time to fight even harder to take it home. I want you guys to go out there and leave everything you got on that floor. Understood? - [All] Yes Coach. - No regrets. 'Cause right now it's either go hard or go home empty handed. And I don't know about you guys, but we've all been through way too much and have worked way too hard to go home empty handed. Am I right? - [All] Yes Coach! Huh, let's go. Who are we? - [All] Warriors! - Who are we? - [All] Warriors! - Who are we? - [All] Warriors! - Who are we? - [All] Warriors - You hear that? They really think they got a chance at beating us. That's not gonna happen, not here today. We will not be losing to weaklings, do y'all understand me? - [All] Yes Coach. - Okay, I got sponsors here, I got scouts here. We got to win. Okay, let's do this. Infinity Squad. - [All] Oo! - [Dylan] Bring it in fellas, bring it in. - [All] Warriors! (buzzing) (clapping) (whistle blows) (distant shouting) - Ready, go, court up. - [Player] Get back, get back. (cheering) (upbeat hip hop music) (laughing) - Ah yeah, fellas, good job, good job. Now get back. Alright fellas, that's okay, come on, come on. Come on Tywan, you gotta make that shot man. - Come on, come on Mike.

(whistle blows) (cheering) Alright fellas listen up, now you guys already know they're gonna play us man to man the whole game, alright? So we're gonna have to play smart and create some more opportunities. - I don't even know why they only losing by three. Y'all need to step it up out there. - [Dylan] One, two, three. - [All] Warriors! - [Tywan] Come on, let's go. (whistle blows) (distant shouting) (cheering) - Defense Doug, defense Doug, for real. - Come on fellas, we gotta rebound. - Come on. (buzzing) (whistle blows) (clapping) - Man, you guys gotta rebound better out there. You gotta box out, that's what we teach you, come on now fellas. - How many times I gotta tell y'all, do not let them shoot, okay? When I say lock it down, I mean lock everything down. Don't let them get nothing passed y'all, alright? This a no flag zone, y'all making me look bad out there, let's go. - Alright fellas, on defense, we'll got a box-in-one this time, alright? - On hoods, y'all let another person go passed three of y'all for another easy layup and everybody walking home, I swear on my mama. - Let's get it going, let's go. (clapping) Warriors on three, Warriors on three. One, two, three. - [All] Warriors! - [Dylan] Let's go. (cheering and clapping) ("Warrior" by JS the Best and MaKinlee Black) - Ha ha, let's go, what's up? Yeah, I got you, I told you. You go, I'll just let you. Come on, you think I'm gonna just let you go like that, huh? Mike, ha. (cheering) - What the, get him outta there. - Go, go. (whistle blows) - Come on Dewey, we need these free throws baby.

(buzzing) - Okay fellas, hey we're right where we need to be. Good job out there. Way to move that ball around. Hey, but now we're heading down that final stretch. - It is not gonna go down like this, playtime is over. Alright, now we need to play our way and y'all know what that means, okay? Now, any opportunity you look for the stick, you do that, okay? They wanna play too close, you make 'em feel it. If they wanna post you up, you make 'em feel it. Alright, take this game, let's go. (clapping) - [Dante] Infinity Squad. - [All] Oo! (buzzing) (distant shouting) (cheering) - There ain't no way in the world you my son. Oh my goodness, for real? (cheering) (whistle blowing) (jeering and shouting) - [Dylan] Come on ref. They're playing dirty out there. That was intentional foul ref. - Get back to your bench. - [Dylan] That was intentional. - [Ref] Back to your bench before I issue a technical foul. - Come on man, come on man, you gotta make that call. That's intentional, then call the dog on foul. - Well played, that's a top foul. - [Tywan] I know, I know man. - Hey, don't even worry about it man. We got you, we got you Red. If that's how they wanna play then we will play. Come on. (dramatic music) (whistle blows) - Let's go! Defense, defense! (cheering) - Let's go, T! Let's go, go crazy! Let's go T, go crazy! - You know what? (cheering) - Yeah, that's the way to go boys, let's go. - Time out, time! Time the, time out! (whistle blows) (cheering) - Fellas look, they're getting flustered out there now. Alright, so they're about to start playing dirty. Look, I already know how Stoney gets down. Y'all see the refs aren't helping us out or nothing. So we gotta go out there, play smart, and let's just get the job done, okay? - I don't know what the hell wrong with you all today, but y'all better get it together and you better get it together fast. Now I need my three point shooters out there stepping up. Run Red Robin and get the ball out to the perimeter. Let's go. (clapping) - [Dante] Infinity Squad. - [All] Oo. - Come here, I need you on that number one, that Justin kid, okay? I need you whenever you can, get a few shots in on the kid, just try to make sure the ref don't see it. - Hang on, what? - You head me boy, what the hell did I say? You get out there and do what I tell you, you wanna be D1 don't you? Okay, yeah, you do what I tell, I hold your ticket. So let's get it cracking.

("Champion" by Brandon Fletcher and Kezia Russell) Let's go fellas. (cheering) It's okay fellas, look, look, just pick it up, come on. (cheering) - Time out, Jeez. - Alright fellas, I see what they doing out there, but we're better than that, we're better than that. We're not gonna let these refs beat us, and we show that we're not gonna let them beat us. This is real life. You either go hard or you go home empty handed. So what's it gonna be, huh? - We want it Coach, we want it bad. - Well then go get it then. - Come on! (cheering) - It's time to turn it up fellas. This the last minute and a half, so make 'em feel it. Let's go! Come here, what did I tell you to do? - Man, Coach, I don't get down like that. I wanna win, but not like that. - Oh, you don't get down like that? Okay, well I hope you enjoy the view from the bench, and watch your whole dreams of playing D ball go down the drain, park it. - Jay, check in for Mikey boy here. (whistle blows) - Is he? Stoney, I know he not. You can't take him away now. Stoney! He cannot take him out right now, he cannot take him out. Damn.
