There he is. My own personal Michael Bublé. The Oasis looks beautiful. Not as beautiful as you. You know, I was thinking about you... In the dusty van. Then, when I woke up and brushed my teeth with my fingernail... I can't believe I kissed that mouth. Well, I was thinking about you, still. And now, here we are in our oasis. My happy place. Face to face with the woman who I've been thinking about ever since I left. Ah, Mishu... You're my stud and my Casanova. Hmm. Mmhmm. Hmm, you? Me? I've been worried sick about you. Mm. Just another day on planet earth. Yeah, it's just another day on planet earth. I know. But I haven't been able to tear myself away from this thing. And it was scary too. I almost peed my underpants when I was.... Well... No, not because of the wine. Well, maybe partly because of the wine. What glass is that? Well, it's four, but you zip it. I deserve this. Now, now, the first movement towards recovery is admitting we have a problem. I'll show you "problem." I think it's getting better. Terry doesn't seem to be concerned at all about how big the fire got last night. Oh, thank god. Hey, I got an exclusive. You did? About the highway? Yeah. Well, I mean, I had the exclusive, until CTPR sourced the shadow van that I guess sourced me. Come on. Oh, god. My last one. Oh, me too. Oh god. Dan, stop. No. Oh, come on! Oh god.

You're okay to stand in. We'll just stay close, all right? Give me a few minutes, in a few minutes? Uh... Yeah, I can do that. Just a few minutes though. Come on. Okay, so not duck soup? No, uh... not duck soup at all. I mean, right now we're just looking at, like, the worst case scenario. Uh-huh. And what changed? Oh, the wind is... is making its own patterns, it's... it's folding in on itself. Get the city, if the... if those people... If they didn't put up such a fuss about the prescribed burns over the years, I mean, now there's trouble, right? Look, Stan, I... you know how this goes, right? I've gotta give the FIO a properly worded statement. Uh, Ter, I mean, I have never subjected you to tabloid stuff. They're already using words like "disastrous" and "unprecedented." Of course they are, because disaster sells. Well, excuse me. Uh, pardon me for saying this, but it's fucked, okay? No, I agree. All the press does is make our lives... At all costs. I mean, it's just what the Pope talked about, I heard somethin'. The Pope? Yeah. The... the Pope what? Something, I dunno, something. He said something. The point is, you know, they're all about profit at any cost. They're... they're... you know public opinion. I'm all about public information. I'm trying to be of service. That's all. Yeah... Well, I... I would be trusting you to figure out a way to put it so that you're not stirring up hysterics. Yeah. Yes. I do not want pressure on our roadblocks. Right. So, how does this work for you, then? Hm? You don't profit financially off disaster. It's like pennies, Terry. Oh. You're kiddin' me. Stan Hurst is not up there among the giants of journalism? I am... I am a local giant. God knows what the shadow van over there makes. Shadow van? Yeah, the sha... they shadow me. They do! Oh yeah? Yes. Well, watch out for them, then. They probably make more than a fire chief. The bigger they are, the harder they fall. There it is. There's the endorphins. Okay, okay... Peachland Voice dot ca. Hi, is this Stan Hurst? Yeah, it is. Hi, this is Patrick. I'm a correspondent here with Canada Media News Network. Uh, yeah? I see on your site you're pretty close to the fire. Yes I am, I'm actually, uh, well beyond the blockade. I've been here since the evacuation order went down at the Upper Trepanier around 2:00 this afternoon. Okay. And you're still there? Uh, yes I am. I'm planning on being here all through the night. Okay, perfect. Stan, can you tell me what happened? Well, as... as you know, fire seasons in BC have gotten worse every single year. Uh, and our worst nightmares happened, uh, this year, uh, when a wildfire was fanned into flame by high winds. But I have to say the, uh, fire crew, the emergency workers down here have just done an incredible job. They've kept everybody safe, they've been fighting the fire. They're just, they're the best people on the ground. Uh... But, the fire, uh, it just keeps coming. Uh-huh. Listen. I'd love to give you a live interview tomorrow morning on national television. Okay. Uh, 7:15 AM pacific time? Is that okay, can you do that? Uh, yeah, no, I think I could do that. Okay, perfect. Is this the number? It'll be one of our top stories. Yup, this... this number is the number. Okay. Talk to you in a few hours then, Stan. Okay. Keep safe. Thank you. Bye. Bye. I'm Stan Hurst. Hello, Stan Hurst... Fuck you, shadow van! Fuck you. Fuck you, shadow van! You wanna, fuuuck you! Fuck you, shadow van. Oh hey, shadow van guys. Guess what I'm doin'? I'm on the fuckin' news! Fuckers. Mishu! Oh my god, Gail. Please tell me everything is okay. Canada Media News Network called, they wanna interview me. What? Yes! Tomorrow morning, 7:15. Come home! I will. Christ on a cracker, I need a shower. And a cup of coffee. Hun, I can't believe it. Busy, busy. Okay, I have to go, I'm gonna try my luck. I think I'm the only one here. The shadow van's back at the roadblock. I know. They're using your photos again. You know, once... once bitten, twice whatever. God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change. The courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference. God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change. The courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference. God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change. The courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference. There it is. The domain. That's my house. Wife always leaves the porch light on for me. Nice. There's the endorphins. ...in over a week. Most residents of High River, an Alberta community that has been devastated by the flooding, have permission to return and assess the damage. Stan Hurst, Peachland dot ca. Stan Hurst. Stan Hurst, Peachland dot ca. Yesterday afternoon, almost 2000 people were made to wait for hours in the heat, only to be told to turn around. Some were told they may not have a home to return to. High River has been evacuated and... virtually vacant for 10 days. Without power, sewage, and water, about a third of the town is still underwater. Protests at police... Stan Hurst, Peachland's... Peachland voice dot ca. Peachland voice. Stan Hurst, Peachland voice dot ca. Many residents have been situated to helplessly stand and watch, demanding to be let in. Hello? Stan. Patrick. So, you're gonna be interviewed by Kendra here in a few minutes. Okay. How's your reception? Um... It... it... it's good. I have four bars. All right. Uh... this interview's gonna be quick. Not too long. Okay. Only a few questions. Uh... we've blocked a minute and a half. Okay, perfect. Okay, perfect. ...The 30 minute bus tours that are being conducted throughout the town. These tours will provide an opportunity for residents to see their homes for the first time since... So, did you get any sleep? Um, no. No, I mean, actually, uh, I was actually out on the fire line, uh, all night last night, which was pretty intense, a privilege I was granted I was taking photographs. I actually, um, helped out in the... Hello? Hello? ...Yeah, it's... obviously never expected this to happen, we unfortunately can't even... Okay, Stan. I'm gonna hand you off to Ken, and you'll be live, yeah? Okay, thank you. That's great. The events have taken a devastating turn as more than... We are now joined by a live caller from Peachlandvoice. ca, who was at the scene when it happened. I'm... I'm sorry, can you... can you repeat that, please? I was just asking how you are. Oh, I'm, uh, I'm good, I'm fine. I'm tired. I'm, uh, you know, which is, uh, kind of, I guess, job description. Uh, as I'm sure I don't have to tell you. Yes, absolutely. Can you tell us how it feels to be in Peachland at the moment? Yeah, well, uh, Peachland is, uh, under a state of emergency. I'm looking out the window right now, there's, uh, just a huge, um, column of smoke. I've spoken with a lot of the residents here and, uh, what I can tell you is it's very, very emotional. It's... it's chaos. It's, uh, it's a zoo here. Can you take us back to yesterday and tell us about the fire behaviour? Uh, yeah. Can you tell us about that, please? Um, well at about 3:30 yesterday afternoon, uh, the weather shifted, uh, we have, uh, wind here in the Okanagan, that um, that... that, uh, turned, and it, uh, came down off the mountains, pushing the fire in.. into the valley. Do you know if we have lost any structures in Peachland due to this wildfire? Yeah. I'm... I'm sorry, can you... can you repeat that please? I was just asking how you are. Hello, are you still there? Hey! So, we have had reports of... There, there have been structures lost, but um... But uh, but I'm, uh, I'm not, uh, I can't comment, I can't comment about that right now. Well, we're getting reports of approximately 10 structures lost to this wildfire. Would you say that is correct? Um, yeah. That sounds about right to me. Um, and... and also, uh, and three outbuildings. Are you able to tell us about the fire, and the status currently? All right, um, the uh, okay... Okay, I think we're going to have to let you go. Unfortunately, we have some technical difficulties that we are dealing... Uh, the... the... the, uh, the fire, uh, is zero percent contained at 5,000 hectares, um, and that's expected to double, uh, in... in the next 24 hours... um, also the... Well, our thoughts are with you and everybody else in Peachland, I'm sure we'll be hearing from you sometime in the near future. Oh... okay. Um, thank you, Kendra. Thank you very much for your time. Um, also, um, um, uh, we're gonna be updating, um, uh, the website at, uh, Peachland voice dot ca, with updated information, and also we're available on Twitter at Peachland voice dot ca, without the dot ca. Okay. Thank you very much for your time. Thank... thank you Kendra, I'll talk to you soon. Hello? Uh, the... the, uh, the fire, uh, is zero percent contained at 5,000 hectares, um, and that's expected to double, uh, in the... in the next 24 hours, uh... Well, our thoughts are with you and everybody else in Peachland, I'm sure we'll be hearing from you sometime in the near future. Oh... okay. Um, thank you, Kendra. Thank you very much for your time. Um, also, um, um, uh, we're gonna be updating, um, uh, the website at, uh, Peachland voice dot ca, with updated information, and also we're available on Twitter at Peachland voice dot ca without the dot ca. Oh, come on, man... Okay. Thank you very much for your time. Thank you Kendra, I'll talk... to you soon. Again, sorry about the technical difficulties, we will try and get another live caller from Peachland coming up. Uh, we will be right back in a few minutes with your forecast. Stay with us. New message. 8:36 AM. Hey, always the voicemail. Listen, I was talking to Trish, and, uh, she said she caught your interview on the TV there, and uh... Oh man. I'm glad... I'm glad it wasn't me. Uh, it's tough to do that kind of stuff. But, uh, she says you got some good facts out there on the air and, uh... well, get some sleep, huh? I'm sure you'll get another crack at it. What's wrong? What do you mean? Well, I don't know. You've been quiet. Yeah. I know. I can't shut my brain off. Work? Eh, maybe. No breaks. And Canada Day tomorrow. Oh god, our glory days. Does it feel like I'm underwater? Fallin' asleep. First job was working at the ice cream store and working at the pet store. And bringing animals home, animals nobody knew about. And thinking your father was gonna have a heart attack when he saw the chickens. And your father saying he was proud, but wondering if he'd still feel that way when he was sober. And rolling a boat out onto the ocean with the luminescence. And every time you pulled the oars, seeing them in the water, reflecting up like swirling galaxies, and the calm water reflecting the real galaxies without being able to see the horizon line. Not knowing where you ended and where space began, and the quiet sound of the ocean rolling into the shore, the "shhh", the same "shhh" that leaves make when they're blown in the fall. The same "shhh" that your mother made when she tried to tell you it was okay to be quiet. Um, also, I wanted to mention quickly, I know it's hot out there, and we want to get to the cake cutting, but um, we'd like to acknowledge all of the residents of Peachland as well as the staff and forestry workers, everyone. We're also working on it after the fireworks, and we'll have more details about that soon... All right hey, we got the... we got the big drumming happening right here under the shade. You're gonna love it. We want all the kids to come on down and drum your little hearts out. We got some cake happening. The Canada, happy birthday cake. You're gonna wanna have that, because hey, you gotta... We got the sack races happening in front of me. Hey. Hey. Honey. You... you might wanna come back to the house. I think there must be a drug bust or something happening close by. There's a ghost car right out front. No way. Yes, way. Stan, there's another one. It's... it's in our driveway. How many? Hang on. They're getting out. They're... they're pointing at the hou... Stan, I think they're looking for someone. Wait, they're... they're coming here. Hold on, Stan. Yes? Mrs Hurst? Yeah. We have a warrant to search your house. Hey, Baxter, behind the dresser. You got any doors in here, any trapdoors or hatch doors? Sorry. Here's Stan. I... You Stanley Hurst? Yeah. I'm Officer Oaks with the Okanagan Regional Police Service. We're, uh, here as part of a child pornography investigation. We have a warrant to search your house. You won't be able to go into your house until after the investigation is over. No. Now, I'm gonna have to ask you to surrender your phone. Um, it's... it's in my van. Uh, where is your vehicle? Uh, Beach and... and 4th. Okay, um, I'm gonna need your keys. The, uh, warrant covers motor vehicles under your ownership as well. They're in the van, sorry. Okay. Um, we'll grab them and return them to you later. Stanley. No one's under arrest. No one's being detained. You're free to go. Once you, uh, grab a coffee or something, come back in a few hours after the officers are done their investigation. Okay. Where's... where's he going? He's just... He... Mrs Hurst, I know this is difficult, but I need to ask you a few questions. Late last night, an undercover police officer was chatting with someone on the internet at the IP address associated with your house. I'm afraid to say this, but that conversation involved children and sex. Does your husband travel a lot for business, Mrs. Hurst? No. Does your husband spend much time with people under the age of 16? Is there anyone under the age of 16 that your husband might have direct contact... No. No, there's no one. There's no one. What kind of books does your husband like to read? I'm sorry. I can't answer these questions right now. I understand, Mrs Hurst. But these questions are to ascertain if there is anyone in immediate danger. Look, I know my husband. I know Stan. I'm sure you do, Mrs. Hurst. I need to ask you a few questions about your sex life. Jesus. Does your husband ever ask you to do anything that you feel is inappropriate? Anything that makes you feel uncomfortable in any way? Smell of pine trees. Smell of flowers. And the smell of Gail. And feeling the overwhelming responsibility of trust. And feeling the rain, feeling the rain come down. Gentle rain you've wanted, all the things you'd miss. All the things you'd miss. Stan? Stan! Gail? I can't! I can't! Yes, you can. Yes, you can. You get over here and you get in this house. Right fucking now! Where did you go? Police were here for a long time. They went through everything. And they asked me questions that uh... I couldn't answer. They were out there looking for you until it got dark. Did you do what the police say you did? I can't do this again. Evacuation order. All properties on Beach Avenue, Lake Avenue and... Talk. Okay. Are you gonna tell me what happened? I don't... I don't even know if I know how to say it properly. I don't care about proper, Stan. What were you doing up there? I thought if I killed myself, you only would be better off. Oh... I'm sorry. I went into a chatroom. Mm-mm. Stop. I love you, Gail. Stop. I love you. Shh. I wrote horrible things. I did. I wrote horrible, horrible things. Who were you talking to? Other people who wrote horrible things. Who are you? So the police, the police are gonna find this... this chat. Yeah, they'll probably find them. Them? Stan, how many? I don't know. What do you mean, you don't know? You don't know like you don't want to say or you don't know because there are too many? Both. How long? I'm so sorry, Gail. I'm so sorry. Are there pictures, or video... No, no, no, no. Nothing. Never. Never. I promise you. How do I believe you? Oh, my god. You really, you really wrote about having sex with children? After the police left here that day, I had a lot of time to think. I thought about when you asked me to marry you, thought about everything that you have given and taken. Thought about every night I would say goodnight and you would say goodnight, and... We'd tell each other I love you. You meant that. I feel it. I do know you, Stan. I know you. But then the sun went down, and oh god, I got so angry. Oh, I was more than... than angry, I was furious, actually. I know. No, no. Not now. You left me after everything. You left me. I wasn't just angry, though. I... I... I... There was something else I... I kept thinking about... about you, Stan, the... My husband. I don't know. What makes me the stronger person? Stay? Leave? I'm gonna tell you everything. I'm spinning, spinning like... like a panic attack. And would you say these thoughts are more like images, or urges? Both. And what is the content of the images? Well, I mean, they're all kinds of... Uh, the worst of them have to do with kids. Mmhmm. Are you comfortable giving me more details? No. Comfortable? It's sexual images. And how do you feel in response to these thoughts? Shameful. You know, aft... after the thought pops up, I'll... I'll spend hours and hours thinking about, uh, you know, whether or not I'm... I'm a pedophile. You know? Just spinning, spinning. Whether... whether I'm a child molester, or... or am I capable of... of committing rape or murdering somebody. Violent thoughts too? Yeah. Like, I'll be driving, and I'll just... I'll suddenly think you know, uh, I... I could just turn the wheel, I could drive straight headlong into traffic. Or one time, I thought, uh, there's a pregnant woman I saw, and I thought I could just kick her. I could kick her right in the stomach, as hard as... as hard as I can. And also other, like, thoughts. Like, countless, like, um, uh, did I lock the car, did I lock the car? Or um, I have these, like, horrible thoughts, that I don't know if they're real. Like, did uh, did I... I... did I run over somebody with my van? Let's say, in a typical day, how much time do you spend preoccupied with these sorts of thoughts. Uh, I mean, you know, on a good day, hours. On a stressful day, it... it could be, uh, days or weeks. Hmm. I'm curious. What were you hoping to experience or discover in the chat room? Why did I do it? Why did I... I think I wanted to understand the thoughts, or that's what I told myself. If... if I wrote it down, if I typed it, I mean, that never worked, but... Or, uh, if... if... if I could find somebody, if I could find other people like me, maybe I could understand myself better. And during the chatting, um, would you masturbate? No. Were you aroused? No. Well, uh, no. I had, I mean, I had feelings, I had, my heart would race, pound, um... I'd have tingling sensations in my hand, my arms. And after the chat? After, after, uh, I'd spend hours hating myself. Just think and think and think about the horrible things I said and wonder why I said 'em. Spinning, did that make me, was that proof I was a pedophile. You know. Were they thoughts or... or fantasies? Was... was... was it real? My worst fear. Okay. Your worst fear? Was that I'd hurt a kid. This is making sense to me. It sounds to me that you were after clarity, one way or another, as to why you have these thoughts or fantasies. Do you think that's the case? From what you're telling me, you weren't going online into these chatrooms for sexual gratification, you were there to... learn about yourself. To find out if you're a pedophile. Yeah. Well, what you're describing sounds to me like it could be consistent with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. Not pedophilic preference. Intrusive thought, unwanted thoughts that involve sex with children, can be a trait of OCD and not that uncommon. In fact there's... Walking the hallway of the old folks home for the last time and seeing your father's face one last time, and making the decision to turn and walk away. And sickness and melanoma, and anesthesia, and counting backwards, and cancer scares. And cancer. And hearing your feet on the floor of the church when you're coming in too late. And the whispers from the nuns, and watching the gold collection plate go by. Salmon croquettes, and the big fan in the summer, and pushing the oscillator so it would just stay on you, and your brother yelling at you. And looking at the shag carpet and thinking it looked like snakes when you had the flu. And always thinking it looked like snakes after that. And the times in the night when it felt like the wind was breath on your cheek, the silence and joy and possibility on your cheek, and holding onto that, and holding onto the smell of barbecue, and holding on to the way the asphalt and the roofs smelled when it was just laid down. And the tar on the road. And the sweetness of summer. And the cold, cold days at the end of February, and the joy of spring, when everything was born again. And everything was born again. Stan? Oh, hey, Terry. Good morning, Stan. Morning. Sorry, I, um, you know to be honest, I was just getting out of the shower. Look, I apologize for, uh, coming over unannounced, but, uh, I tried calling like... like a bunch of times. My cell? Yeah, damn thing. Yeah. Straight to voicemail every time. Yeah, I haven't seen you in a while. I've been meaning to make more calls, but, uh, I'm kind of in the middle of a transition to be honest. Yeah, no kidding. No kidding. Thinking about, uh, selling the site, which, I'm not sure, you know, one way or the other. It goes against, uh, Peachland Voice's credo, you know. And here we are. Stan, are you okay? I... I ask because, um, well, I don't want to pry, but we got this, um, phone call. Call? Uh, it was, um, well the police called. They were looking for you, they said your family was looking for you, they said you were... uh, uh, distressed. I really, um, I... I don't want to pry, but um... Do you smoke? Uh... Yeah. Sometimes. Very carefully. Oh shit. Smoking fire chief, that's not a good look, eh? So... I... I was having a tough time, and, uh, anyhow. I'm doing better now. Well, you look better. Hell, we all looked like death back in the thick of it, right? So listen, Stan. The... the reason that I'm here is I tried calling like I said, and then, well you got that email from the city council. Email? Oh, the, um... yeah. About the breakfast. About the breakfast. The breakfast this morning. I... I can't do that, Terry. Look, I knew you were gonna say that, but um, whatever it is, it... it can wait. Just... put it on pause, it'll be worth your while, I promise you. Just, I don't know, maybe a different shirt, and away we go. Yeah? Yet these heroes and heroines were real. Grit, gristle and all, and yes, a lot of spunk. I'll keep my remarks like the latest fashion, long enough to cover the subject, but short enough to be interesting. Thank you. It was Peachland's greatest time of need. Hundreds displaced, homes threatened, emergency personnel working countless overtime hours. In one fell swoop, a wildfire changed our lives forever. On behalf of the City of Peachland, I would like to acknowledge the following people. First and foremost, the Peachland fire crew. Chief Terry Rocklyn, Allan Varrett, Chris Stephens, Ray Herrin, and Peggy Spallack. And all the rest of them. You banded together and shone a light, fending away the ever encroaching danger and clearing a path, a safe path, to those in their darkest times. Thank you. Oh no, don't. Sorry, wait for Benjamin. Go. Yep. Um, thank you, Lorraine. Well, uh, I guess it's usually a really good thing when you find out you're going to be working from home. Unless you're a firefighter. The mic went off! Uh... I say, unless you're a firefighter. Uh... great. Thanks Ben. Hello, hello? Hey, there, that's much better. Uh, well, listen, all I really wanted to say about the fire was, um, it was the most challenging experience of my entire career, and, uh, well, I hope to god it stays that way. And, uh, for my brothers and sisters, all I can say is, uh, I am, uh, I am just so proud of you. Thank you, Terry. I don't have my mic, so I'll use my theatre training. The Okanagan Regional Police Service. Test. Constable Lawrence. Test. Officer Baxter. Test. Officer Cunningham, Officer Reynolds. Test. Long have you been the guardians of our safety and wellbeing, and at no time was this more evident than during the fire of 2013. The stewards of this small town. We the people will never be able to properly thank you for the mountain you've climbed. Test. Lorraine. Ladies and Gentlemen, on behalf of the Okanagan regional police service, and surrounding departments, our mission statement ha... is and always has been to provide quality service in partnership with our community. I would like to thank you for this distinguished honour. Thank you, Constable Lawrence. Stan Hurst. Nobody is one thing. People are many things all at once, and Stan, Stan, would you please stand? Stanley Hurst. Stan has a long history here in Peachland, not only as a world-class reporter, but as a cherished member of our community. Our fanatic sleuth and informer. The glue that held us together. As you all well know, the distinction for citizen of the year is ordinarily handed out at our Christmas Cheer event, but given the circumstances, we unanimously decided that this was the appropriate venue. So, Ladies and Gentlemen, here is your citizen of the year for 2013. Stanley Hurst. Stanley! A few words? Um... Uh, thank... thank you, thank you. Um, I don't, you know, speak in- public speaking, I don't do, um, obviously, you know, because of what I do for a living, uh, it's clear... Um... I love communicating, and, uh, I... I love Peachland. Oh, thank you, thank you... Thank you, Stan. For you, Stan, our resident metropolitan, we would like to award you with a weekend getaway in the big city. Gift certificates for a hotel room and some various restaurants in Vancouver. Wow. And now of course, you all know me as a bit of a troublemaker and a rascal, so I would be remiss not to mention the glaring irony here, that being that the reward for being an integral part of the community is an opportunity to leave it for the weekend. Oh, such fun. Okay, enjoy your breakfast, and, uh, we'll see you in a minute. Stan. Stan. Over here for the picture. I'm... I'm, I'm okay. Citizen of the year award, Stan. I'm just reading the thing. Stan, in the picture, please. Stan! What the hell? Uh, ooh, sorry. Come on. There you go. All right. Could I get Stan in the middle? Perfect. And can we get everybody to cozy up just a little bit? All right, if we could all say "Peachland." Peachland! I still see the fire coming up over the ridge. Our house should've burned. This block. The whole town. Maybe it still will, somehow. You'd think we'd have heard something by now. You know, considering that they have our phones, our computers, your possessions. These are, these are things we own. Well, they're building a case, I think. Or, maybe one day soon, there'll be a knock at the door, and we'll be free to go on with our lives. You'll be free to get better. I can't even think about it. It helps, sometimes. Yeah, people ask me, how... how are things going, and I lie. Ask about you, I lie. So if I can do it for them, why can't I do it for myself? Just every now and again. Yeah, there it is. First colours. It's like when we were young, remember? We used to stay up all night waiting for the sun to come up. Ooh, the lighting storm. Oh, the lightning storm. In the tent. Shut up! You said, wait for it... Oh... Uh, I believe I'm destined for something big. That's where it all started. Past says we don't get those days back. But you know, you're right. I used to daydream about being rich and famous. Well, you know, there's a purity there. Oh, please. There is, that... that feeling of being destined for something big. I mean, not rich and famous, but just good. I think you are. Mishu. You are. You're good. I feel so weird. It's so new. I... I can focus, I have energy, I can sleep through the night. Yeah, I've noticed something. It... it's in your eyes, the way you look at me, it's like you're really, well... You looking at me. I can't explain it. I don't know what I want to believe, or what's better. Medication's working, or I'm actually getting better on my own. Why does it have to be one or the other? Can't it be many things at once? Hello? Gail, it's Marjorie. Oh, hey Marj. God, where are you? Kitchen? Gail, turn on the news. Oh god, it's horrible. What? Oh god, they're saying "child porn." Marj, I... I have to go. ...Who ran an online news site for the small Okanagan community has been charged with three counts in child pornography. Where'd they get this? Acting on information allegedly obtained online, by an undercover police officer, a search warrant was executed at his Peachland home in July to seize computer equipment. Stanley Andrew Hurst will make his first appearance at the Kelowna Courthouse on December 5th, where he faces charges of making or publishing child pornography... What? ...Importing or distributing child pornography, and possession of child pornography. Child pornography? For the full story go online. Gail, I don't know... Distribution? Shh!!!!! Turn it off. Stan? Where did these charges come from? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I... And how did they find out about it before us? I don't know. I don't know. I don't... Okay. Okay. Okay. Oh god. I'm right here. It's just us. You have five new voice messages. To play your messages, press 1. New message. 10:19 AM. Gail, it's Marge. You're not welcome at Thanksgiving. I wish there was another way. New message. 2:41 PM. Hey, buddy. You got any fuckin' idea what they do with pieces of shit like you in prison? I fuckin' hope they lock you up and throw away the key, you son of a bitch. You're a sick fuck. Piece of shit. You know what I find funny, is that you have fuckin' nowhere to hide, you piece of shit. Everybody fuckin' knows what you look like. Okay. Okay. Hey, Adam. Hey, Adam. Hi, Adam. Hi, Adam. Hi. Fuck. Hi. Hey, Adam. You don't love this town, Stan! You fucked this town! Okay. Yeah, this is Stan. What? No, no, that... that won't work, that won't. No, I won't lift a finger for less than 50,000. No, and also, by the way, I am, I am unreachable tonight. Rrrr. Shh, no. Huh? The board? No, I don't care... Me? I'm not, I'm not afraid of my own success. I'm not afraid to make mad sick money. You... you tell the board that unless they can make cloning happen, in... in which case we... we are all set. Well, I don't care. Yeah. At the board, you tell the board, you tell the board that I, um... that... Oh. Paid vacations. Leasing cars. Quiet family dinners. Making sandwiches for the road. Boys nights. Buying an electric guitar. Going to the library for how-to's. Not being able to buy the couch. Seeing your face. Your face. Seeing you. Thinking I see you, and then seeing you. Reading you Yates. Reading you... Lurking for the raise, pining for the raise, hoping to get the raise, not getting the raise. Getting laid off. Your hair. Your shoulders. The golden years. New retirement home, and how much it reminds you of summer camp. And suddenly you're the funniest guy in the room. And watching your brothers and your sisters and all your friends die. And then dying by yourself. Not by yourself. With your wife by your side. One last kiss. It passes so quickly, and it's gone. We can't get those days back. The accused is charged with one count of making child pornography under section 163.12 of the criminal code of Canada, one count of distribution of child pornography under section 163.13, and one count of possession of child pornography under section 163.14. Child pornography, as defined in section 163.11 of the code includes any written material whose dominant characteristic is the description for sexual purpose of sexual activity of a person under the age of 18 years. That would be an offence under the code. The inclusion of written material in the offence of the making, distributing and possession of child pornography, does not amount to thought control. Though the events recounted in the chat log did not take place, evidence suggests that the cognitive distortions of pedophiles are reinforced by such materials, and that written pornography fuels the sexual fantasies of pedophiles, and could incite them to offend. The stories describe criminal sexual encounters between adults and children, that include episodes of fellatio, cunnilingus, and intercourse. Ladies and gentlemen, a fair warning. This material is disturbing. As you'll recall, Hurst wrote about an encounter with a neighbour's daughter saying "I can't help but notice the shape of her body "underneath her clothes. "And now I can't stop thinking "about what her naked body must look like. "Would there be something about it that would excite me? "I can't rid myself of this question. "So I ask her if she needs to have a shower, "and if it would be okay for me to watch. "She says yes." "She takes off her clothes for me. "As she slips off her panties, I catch a glimpse "of her budding breasts and light pink nipples. "Her tiny ass." Ladies and gentlemen, this could be your neighbour. It goes on, only getting more dark and depraved. "I can feel my heartbeat in my throat, "but I can't make sense of these feelings, "so I reach out and touch her milky skin. "A gentle touch..." It passes so quickly, and it's gone. And we can't get those days back. Things were about to get so much better for us, I swear. It was this close. You okay?
