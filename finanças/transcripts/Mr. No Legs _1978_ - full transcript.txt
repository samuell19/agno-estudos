(upbeat music) (knocking) - [Tony] Yeah? - It's Lou. How's it going, Tony? - Fine. - It's good stuff. - It's better than the last batch. This is the last of it though. - Don't worry, I'm working on it. (phone rings) Yeah? It's about time. Tonight? Sure. Usual place? Right. Still in business. (eerie music) (engine roaring) Mike, I got your call, is it going down? - Yeah, this is it. Benny's been here and gone, and I expect him back. - Good, I've been after him a long time. There he is now. Mike, we gotta take him but we've got to be careful. There's a lot of people and there's tankers in here. We can't do any shooting. - Let's get outta here. Wait. (grunting) (tense music) - Mike, go ahead and book these guys. - Alright, let's go, Tom. - There's seven markers, right? - Yeah, so far. (dramatic music) - It's all there? - Yeah, it looks like it. - Think he suspected anything? - Nah. The stuff passed through too many hands, better get rid of it. - Evening, gentlemen. Planning on starting your own operation here? Get the stuff. Bring the car. They tried to rip us off. - [D'Angelo] You better get outta here fast. - [Reporter] N33 signaling to 44, shooting, south bay docks. - 104, will dispatch uniformed units to that 1020. (indistinct chattering) - [Woman] You know what's funny? Oh, yeah yeah. - Well, I'm certainly glad you came, I want to talk to you later. - [Man] Nice, Bernie, thank you. - Lovely because of your presence, my dear. - [Woman] Watch it. (laughs) - Excuse me. Hello Bill, how are you? - The Opera Guild is deeply grateful for what you did last week. - Well, the arts are of the few constancies in this world. Marcell, you look magnificent. Senator, I'm glad you made it tonight. Will I talk to you later? - You managed to escape last time. This time I hope you'll spend some time with me. - Nothing would give me greater pleasure. - Mr. D'Angelo, how is it? - I'll be back in just a minute. You're late. - Had to plug a leak in our supply line. - You're not getting messy on me again, are you? I won't tolerate any more of that. - There won't be no trouble. - There better not be. Come on, join the party. - Here's a little bonus for you kid, have yourself some fun. - Hey, thanks Luke. I gotta hit the books tonight, exams tomorrow, but I know what to do with it come mid-term break. - I'll call you next shipment comes up. - [Ken] Sure. (engine roaring) (energetic music) - Tina? Hey. Dawn? Ah. Still no. - I'm leaving, Ken, okay? And don't try and stop me. - Why, what's happened? - Well, I was cleaning the apartment today and this is what I found. Are they for... - Tina, wait, I can explain. I'm not shooting drugs, you know that. - No, but what you're doing is much worse than that. - Slow down, well, at least we can talk about it? - There's nothing to talk about. - Be reasonable, will ya? How you think I can afford this place? Besides, I needed the money for tuition. - Tuition for college? Oh yeah, and what about the girls who OD'ed in the dorm the other day, what about them? Can you guarantee to me, Ken, that your stuff didn't kill them? Can you guarantee me that? - Calm down, I've a really heavy burden, you know? - Well, it's a heavy scene, too heavy for me. - You can't leave, I won't let you. - Ken, you can't stop me. - Listen to me, I'm gonna tell ya what. - Ken. (crashing) (sobs) - Hello, Lou? Like I said, it was an accident. - [Lou] Dead's dead, kid. (sighs) Where's she from? - Not far from here. - Any relatives? - Just a brother. - Well, since it was accidental and you're clean, maybe you better just call the police. Got any stuff around here you don't want them to find, get rid of it. - Afraid it's not that simple, Lou. - What do you mean, it wasn't an accident? - It was an accident, just her brother. That's why I figured I should call you first. - What about her brother? (sighs) - He's a cop. (tense music) (phone rings) - [Tom] Hi Andy. - Hi Tom. - [Andy] Quiet night? - [Tom] Yeah, pretty much. What's this? - Took it off no. one. - If it's a guy the lawyers just put in the tank his only connection with this is he probably stole it. - Yeah, that'd be my guess. - Hey, Andy, you look good, how are you? - Fine, check out our stuff. - Beautiful. Surveillance on this special enforcement unit is a snap. 'Course you big-shot drug boys, you get all the glamor, don't you? Tom look, when you research this, put the file on Hathaway's desk for me, will ya? - You bet. - Gentlemen, I am going home. - Yeah, I think I'll go too. - It'll be better this way, kid. That little lark there, I think she OD'ed and hit her head in a fall. - Or maybe her pusher wiped her up. - What if they still trace her to me? - Tell 'em she split a couple weeks ago. Besides, if her brother learns that she was shacking up with you instead of sleeping in that dorm he's been paying for, why, he'll believe she was capable of anything. Let's get our crap together and make a move. (uneasy music) (talking indistinctly) - Okay, let's get her other things. - [Ken] What do we do with them? - Leave it to me, I know how to dispose of evidence. (gun fires) (dramatic music) Put him in the trunk, we'll stop by and get the bike later. - [Announcer] Doctor Paul Gray, please contact operator. - Sorry Captain, I came as soon as I could. Is this true? - Yeah, it's true. - How did it happen, sir? - [Captain] Well, it appears she OD'ed. - Oh no, not that way, not her. - My sentiments exactly. - Does Andy know about it? - No, not yet, but he's on his way over here. - Would you like me to break it to him, sir? - Thanks, Chuck, I better do it. I'm more family than he and Tina ever had. - I understand, sir, I sure do admire the way you've been bringing him along. - Well, he deserves it, he's a good man. - Yes sir, is there anything that I can do? - Yeah Chuck, would you go down to the station and take over for me too, this isn't over. - I'll do it sir, I'll be there if you need me. - [Andy] What's up, Kevin? - Andy, something's happened. - No. (indistinct chattering) - Okay, listen, I got a joke also. Coming back from that beach, saw a freak accident. You got it, two freaks bumped into each other. Terrible accident, terrible. One was so shook up, got a bad case of the hiccups. Sounds fearful. Yeah, it's fantastic that he's supposed to be ushering, you can go out and buy a boat. You know what a boat is? It's a hole in the water filled with money. (mumbling) but she does have a couple good points. She's kinda skinny, we called her a pole 'cause she's got so many bony parts. We got a fantastic audience tonight, so why don't I leave you with that? (applauding) Thank you, thank you. Thank you. And now, ladies and gentlemen, a special added attraction I know you'll enjoy. Here they are, that million-selling record group, the fantastic Mercy singing their latest release, I Still Remember Love, here we go. ("I Still Remember Love") * Do you still like to watch the rain * Sometimes pick flowers you'll never keep * Does the evening bring you gladness * Or is it going to let you weep * Sometimes I wonder * Do you still like to walk in meadows * Lie suspended in glowing green * Or do you wake with the new dawn's shadow * To reach for some * To find your dream and I * I still remember love sometimes * Sometimes in the morning I - [Gwen] Bob, take this, I'll be right back. - Yeah. * Things to think of - I heard about your sister, I'm so sorry sweetheart. - Hey Andy, Serena wants to see you tomorrow night. - Oh, thanks. - You won't be in shape to see anybody if you don't get out of here now. Come on, let's go to my place, please? (crickets chirping) (brooding music) - I'd be glad to, sir. - [Tom] Excuse me sir, you said you wanted this as soon as it came in. - Oh yes, thanks. (sighs) It was an OD alright, but it was administered at least an hour after her vital organs had stopped functioning. - No, sir. Not until after I get the killer, sir. - Breakfast time. This should really help. - [Andy] All I need is some coffee. - All you need is a little vacation. How about it? - Sorry, we can't. - Well, it's always nice to know you're so irresistible. - Don't be that way, you know I have a lot on my mind. - Sorry, just trying to help. - I know. What time did Sammy say Serena wanted to see me? - Didn't say anything, just tonight. - No, lady, no, the Humane Society. We don't have anything to do with dogs. Right. (laughs) - Sergeant, you're looking at somebody's whole life in a cardboard box. I tell you, for a college girl she travels pretty light. - That's all? - That's all from the school. Obviously she didn't live there. - Uh oh. - Don't you tell Andy that. Think you could put this on my floor, please? Oh, wait just a minute. I'll take care of this piece. - Got something? - Could be. It's forwarded to an apartment address down on the east side. I'll see you later. (engine droning) Excuse me. Pardon me. - Oh. - Thank you. I'm Detective Roberts, police. - Oh my goodness, what's happened? - Just a few questions if you don't mind. I believe that this girl is one of your tenants, is that correct? - No, well, not exactly, but I have seen her. Her boyfriend lives here. - When was the last time that you saw her? - Oh my, it's hard to say. Sometime last week, I think. - [Chuck] What about the boyfriend, is he in? - Oh, I doubt it, he's a student, you know. - I'd really like to look into his room if you don't mind. - Well, is that sort of thing legal? I mean, shouldn't there be a warrant or something required? - Lady, I can make it as legal as you want if it's absolutely necessary, but I thought that the owner would like to keep a check on the welfare of one of her tenants, that's all. - Oh yes, yes, well, I'll do that right away. - [Chuck] Thank you. - Look at this stuff, a person could get hurt. And who do you think they'd sue? But you can't find good help, so I have to be the gardener and police off after him. - This boyfriend, is he one of those noisy types? - Oh no, he's quiet as a church mouse, and clean too. If all my tenants were like him I could relax. Oh my. Oh, there must have been a fight. - Either that or quite a party. (unsettling music) Is this man your tenant? - Yes, that's Ken, Ken Wilson. - Well, thank you very much. Now, I want you to call me at this number if that Wilson fella comes back. - [Woman] If he comes back he's gonna get a piece of my mind. - I can't believe how far you've come in such a short period of time. This place is really fantastic. And just to think, it's all yours. - This would be great for you, Andy, to just forget the whole world. - We'd better go. - No lying around a few days? - I'm sorry. - Well, back to the old cloak and dagger routine. - It's not cloak and dagger, it's undercover. - Well, I wasn't impressed by your undercover performance last night. - Thanks a lot, I'm gonna drop you by the club. - Run a check on this and see if the blood type's the same as the victim's, would you please? - [Doctor] For sure. - Captain, this cashier's receipt's dated the 7th. That's the night that Tina was killed according to the coroner's report. - Well, I'll run this down to the morgue first thing tomorrow. I'll check all the John Doe stiffs and see if one of 'em is this Wilson boy. Now fellas, let's keep this to ourselves for the time being. No use getting Andy's hopes up until we know there's a connection. Bring me that report as soon as possible. - Yes sir. - Chuck, keep me up to date on this. - Right. (unsettling music) - Ready for the statement? - Yeah, sure, sure. But wait here a minute, I think we got something. - I'll wait in the car. (relaxing music) (phone rings) - Hello? Yeah. - I told you never to interrupt me when I'm eating. - You're found out. - First the officer, now the house. Yep? Who picked up the last of it? - Lou, like always. - [D'Angelo] Hello? - No, it's a two-man operation. - Is the other guy's name Wilson? Uh huh. No no, you did right by calling me. Yeah. Wilson's missing, you know where he is? - He's dead. - You just can't learn, can you? You're always making decisions without consulting me. You got hurt working the docks for me, I took good care of you. Maybe too good. Now you're screwing up my organisation. We don't operate that way anymore. - Maybe you're getting soft. - Now you let me worry about that. You just hope that this Wilson punk's body doesn't turn up. - Don't worry, I'll take care of it. - Something else for you to take care of. This man who called me. I don't have to beat him up, I pay him money. He said there's a leak in your territory. - He's a liar. - Really? Well you better get in touch with Bessie, she knows. And get this right this time or you're gonna find yourself on a street corner with a tin cup and a handful of lead pencils. - [Fred] Damn him. - What's wrong, boss? - I'll show him who he's gonna put out on the street with pencils. - Aw hell, you don't have to take that kinda garbage from him. - I'm gonna take everything he's got, get the car. - [Announcer] Adam seven. Adam seven. 182 requires PGHE numbers. - With all the nice places in town what did you bring me down here for? - Maybe it has something to do with the way I was raised. - You were never raised, you grew. Here, you want mustard or ketchup? - The hotter the better. (radio announcer speaking indistinctly) - Andy, your sister, did she date a lot? I mean, did she have a steady fella? - No, she was always too busy with the books. Get a load of that. - Oh, beautiful, isn't he? (laughs) He got platform shoes and matching earrings. - [Andy] I wonder what he's up to. - He's up to his neck in debt, I'll tell ya that. That's how come he's coming outta there. It's the middle of the week, he's looking both ways for Saturday. - He could be a pusher. - Oh he's a pusher alright, but what he's pushing you stroke, you don't smoke. He's a beginner pimp and a very unsuccessful one. But besides, you're a lot more interested in that hockshop over there, aren't you? Andy, you got me down here on my lunch hour on a stakeout? - That's where the junkies hang out. - Well alright, let's go pick 'em up then. - The orders are to observe and report. (groans) (upbeat dance music) - You wanted to see me? - Yeah, get yourself a drink. - Right. - Excuse me, I noticed you weren't wearing any jewelry. - I don't believe in tangibles. - Can I buy you a drink? - I'd love it. - What'll you have? - I'll have another beer. - Another beer for the young lady please. I'm sorry. - Kneesies are so crude. But you could hold my hand. - Now this joint's where she's at. - Well, it's the old 7 Seas, I grew up around here. - [Andy] Oh yeah? - Yeah, this neighborhood's changed a little though, I can tell you that. (chattering indistinctly) - Well looky here, if it ain't old bitchy Bessie. When did the fuzz let you out, nigger? - Don't nigger me, you damn white-ass stoolie. - [Serena] Stoolie? - Well, that's what you really are, a white-ass stoolie. - [Serena] You're a damn liar. - You went to speak with the fuzz, I found that out last week in the slammer. - You lying bitch, when I get through with your ass, Betty, you won't even be able to give it away. (upbeat rock music) (yelling) - [Man] Wait. - You little bastard. - Get her Traynor, get her. - That black bitch. (coughing) - [Operator] Operator. (operator speaking indistinctly) * I don't wanna get a job * 'Cause working's just a waste of time * I'm gonna be telling the verse * For the rest of my life * But if she touches me at home - Who are we waiting for? - My informant called me, said she wanted to see me. May be something about Tina's death. - Oh, well, you go on in, I'll wait for you. * Come on (chattering indistinctly) - Hey. (tense music) (yelling) (grunting) (grunting) - [Man] Here, here! (grunting) - Andy, what happened? Didn't you like the service or what? - The service is fine. They need to clean up the floor show. - I can't take you anywhere, can I? This blonde lady your contact? You just lost her. (brooding music) - I'm gonna call in the white caps. - Hyper damn. (cheerful music) (children yelling) (phone rings) - Get lost, babe. Hello? - [Lou] It's Lou. - Where in the hell's Wilson's body? - Listen, I did exactly what you told me but it ain't there. Well, of course I remember where I dumped it. - Well then what happened? - Well, they must have found the body. - Shit. - So what do we do now? Oh no no no, we can't do that. Well, it's... It just ain't healthy after this long. - Get the mole there to go along. - Yeah, uh huh, alright, alright. I'll pick him up on the way over. (horn beeps) (unsettling music) (horn beeps) (horn beeps) - [Sammy] Hi Moler. Hey, what's the deal? - I need your help, get in the back and put this on. - [Sammy] Okay. (phone rings) - Hello? - Hi Gwen, right, listen, is Andy around? - [Gwen] Yes. - May I speak with him? - Just a moment. It's Chuck. - Yeah? - Listen, I hope I didn't interrupt anything important. - You're too late. - I want you to come with me down to the morgue. We're gonna have to identify a body. - [Andy] Sure, when? - I'll pick you up in five minutes. - [Andy] Okay. - Bye. (unsettling music) - Now let me do the talking. - Make it fast because he's with that creep. - Yeah. - Can I help you? - Yeah, we came to get the Wilson boy to take to the funeral home. - [Doctor] I'm sorry, I don't have any Wilson listed. - I believe he's a John Doe. - Well then how are you gonna know him? - Well, I was personally acquainted with the kid. - Yeah, but you're not a member of the family, right? - No, but I'm a friend of theirs and I'd just like to check the corpse to make sure that there's no mistake. - Yeah, well, I can't release anybody until I get positive ID. - Well I can give you that. Young guy, blond-headed, mustache, early 20s. - I'm sorry, you're gonna have to wait for identification. - Oh come on pal, give us a break. We got a lot of work to do and it's getting late. - I'm sorry, this body is being held especially for ID by the police. - Police? Well, that's ridiculous. - Well, it shouldn't take too long. I called them about a half an hour ago. (screams) What the hell? (coughs) - I wish she had told me right away. - Why, you couldn't do any more than what's already been done, Andy. Besides, you know, we might be barking up the wrong tree. - Yeah, but at least they gave me something to go on. - Yeah, come on. (grunting) Excuse me nurse, where can we find Charlie? - I think he's in the morgue. - Thank you. (coughing) (grunting) - Help! (grunts) - Quick, quick, he's trying to steal our corpse. - Let go of me, oh man, let go of me. I'm a police officer, I got a man down in there. - [Lou] Get in the van. - You alright Andy? It's the liveliest morgue I ever been in, I'll tell you that. - How about that body we came to look at? - Well, this is the only candidate we got. - [Andy] That's Ken, Ken-- - [Chuck] It's Ken Wilson. - Yeah, yeah. - [Chuck] You know him? - Yeah, he dated my sister. Does this mean he's involved in the organization? - You bet it does, mister, we got us a positive connection. (knocking) (crickets chirping) (phone rings) - [Andy] Hello. - Hello, Andy? - [Andy] Yeah. - This is Sammy. - [Andy] What do you need? - Somebody wants to talk to you alone. - [Andy] Who? - [Sammy] I don't know. - What's it's about? - It has something to do with what Serena had to tell you before she was killed. - [Andy] Does he wanna see me now? - Right now, at the 7 Seas. - I thought they were closed. - Listen, the front door'll be open. - Okay, I'm on my way. - He'll be waiting. - That was very good. (yells) That cop's a real pain in the ass, but this time I'll be there to back you guys up. - What's the matter? - What did you do with the keys to my car? - They're in my purse. Where are you going anyway? - I need to go to the 7 Seas. Damn. - What's wrong now? - I left my gun in the Camaro and Chuck's got it. - [Gwen] Here. Take mine. - Call this a weapon? Guess it's gonna have to do. - Please take care. - By the way, if I'm not back by daylight call the station and tell the guys I had to go to the 7 Seas. - Okay. (dog barking) (tense music) (grunting) (gun fires) (screams) (gun fires) (gun fires) (crashing) (gun fires) (yells) (grunting) - Andy? (breathing heavily) - What are you doing here? - Well, Gwen called me but never mind that, are you okay? - [Andy] Yeah, give me a minute. - 1033, this is 977. I've got 980 involved in an incident. I need a 1032, 1033 and a fire and rescue unit sent to 2200 West Franklin, confirm? - [Radio Operator] 104, 977 ambulance, 1051 at 02:00 hours. - What do you know about a guy in a wheelchair? - A wheelchair? - [Andy] Yeah, a guy with no legs. - Wait a minute, one of D'Angelo's enforcers lost his legs a couple of years ago, didn't he? What about it? - He tried to blow my head off, he tried to set me up. - [Chuck] Are you sure? - Yeah, and this same guy was in the bar the night Serena was killed. - D'Angelo, huh? Maybe things are starting to add up. - What does? - Well, I never believed that drug connection at Tina's death. To me it was just a cover-up for a murder or an accident. Wilson's death cleared that up. Now we've always had a lot of heavy drug traffic here, but we've never had a really big bust. - Somebody's gonna take. - Of course, we both know that. But something else has been bothering me, and on the way down here it finally started to click. - [Andy] What's that? - Well, you're not gonna like it. - Let me be the judge of that. - Alright. When I searched Wilson's apartment, I came away with three items. - [Andy] Yeah, you told me that. - Now, Hath took the photograph to check the morgue. - That's routine. - But he didn't check it. He didn't check it and his exact words were to see if one of them is the Wilson boy. - So? - So I hadn't made a report yet. I hadn't used the name Wilson. - And just a minute, a punk like that probably had a record a mile long. - Wrong, he was clean as a whistle. He just came into town in time for the fall semester. - Are you trying to say that Hath's gonna take? - I told you you wouldn't like it. - You're wrong about Hath. - I sure hope I am, but we gotta find out for sure, Andy. Listen, if he's innocent nothing's gonna happen to him. - What are we gonna do? - Now, he thinks we're both teaming up at night, so we run a 24-hour surveillance on him. One of us in the daytime, one of us in the nighttime. What about that? (sighs) - Okay, we'll try it. (sirens wailing) - Mr. D'Angelo ain't gonna like all this jazz with the cops, especially the one whose sister got knocked off. - There's a lot of things he ain't gonna like. Now I'm taking over. Move out. (gentle music) I really don't know what he wants. You'll have to go over there and find out. - What did you tell him? - Well, since a package comes today I told him his friend the cop wanted to see him over there right away. - And what's he gonna do when the cop doesn't show up? - Oh, he'll be there too. I decided to kill two birds with one stone. - Well, Fred No Legs has gotten too sloppy for our operations. - Want us to relieve him of his duties? - Yeah, let him go. But not here, and be careful of that wheelchair. - We'll separate him from that plaything right off. - [Andy] That one. - Alright, do you want me to drop you off and get some breakfast, and I'll come back here and start tailing him. - You got plenty of time. - Alright. - He won't be up for a while. Hey. - Boy, he's sure in a hurry, isn't he? We'd better forget about breakfast for right now. (brooding music) - You fellas take care of things, I'll drive myself. (grunting) (screams) (screams) (screams) (grunting) (grunting) (grunting) - Get the car. (tense music) - [D'Angelo] How are you today? - [Radio Operator] One beta five, temple baker. - Now, if you were smuggling drugs what would you need besides a way to bring the stuff in? - A place to stash it. A place to cut it up. - Right. - Ready? - Yeah. (tense music) - [Mike] Keep your eyes open. - What have you got on your mind? This better be important. - What better be important? - Come on, come on, make it snappy. I'm not used to being summoned by the hired hands. - Wait a minute, you summoned me. - It's a setup. - Who called you? - No Legs gave me a message. - Well, he's the one who called me. - [D'Angelo] Then I was right about him, he's been getting a little too ambitious. (laughs) - Well, I don't think it's so funny. - Relax my friend, since we were set up by No Legs there's nothing to worry about. - What do you mean? (laughs) - I really must tell you sometime, you wouldn't believe the precision time will involve. I'll have to arrange another contact for you. - It's getting rather risky, I'm gonna need a bigger slice. - [D'Angelo] We'll talk about it over lunch. I got a golf date I don't wanna be late for. - No, we'll talk about it now. - Gentlemen. (gun firing) (gun fires) - Hold it, Hath. (gun fires) (gun fires) (gun fires) (gun fires) (gasps) (screams) (guns firing) - [Chuck] Look. - Unit 980, 1033 traffic. - All units stand by, emergency 1033 traffic, go ahead 980. - [Mike] This unit's in pursuit of a 1973 Camaro, color orange, was found on 9th occupied by white male. (siren drowns out voice) (siren wailing) - [Announcer] Spotted, suspect vehicle in pursuit. Assisting 980. (siren wailing) - Set up roadblock. Vehicle in pursuit now headed west on Magnolia.

(horn drones) (bell rings) (rhythmic clanging) (sirens wailing) - [Man] You down there, are you mad? (indistinct chattering) - [Man] Look what you've done. - [Man] Do you think this is fair play, look. (siren wailing) - Suspect vehicle just crossed Davis Bridge. Be advised, all units. Police vehicle involved in signal four accident. Suspect vehicle still proceeding westbound on Ninth and Hirated Street. (sirens wailing) - [Man] Unit two has spotted suspect vehicle, now in pursuit. - [Andy] 980 suspect vehicle, east on Canal Road. Need more units to pursue. - Suspect vehicle now approaching Picnic Island area. (cheerful country music) (sirens wailing) (cheerful country music) - [Man] My trailer. For Christ's sake. - [Man] Unit one Adam six is now in pursuit. (siren wailing) (booming) (siren wailing) - [Andy] 980 is now east on Picnic Island. 980, we are now entering Dockwood. (tense music) (crashing) 980, still has suspect vehicle in sight. - Units one Charlie three one, Charlie six, what is your 1020 at this time? - [Man] Well, Adam seven now has suspect vehicle in dock area. - [Andy] 980 in dock loading area, lead suspect vehicle's 1020. - Suspect vehicle approaching dock area. (sirens wailing) All units respond to dock area to intercept. - Hath. - No, only me. I had gotten to deal with... (muttering indistinctly) (groans) I kept record and... (sirens wailing) (groans) (bright country music) * Jesse was a bad man * And he had his wicked ways * Knowing sure of a lot * Bring its own in * Lived by the roar of the six-gun * And he died with blood on his hands * But the men that knew him * All knew what I'd do in the last * Benny was a good kid * Living in a * When a man who judged by the way * He handled a gun * Good man, bad man, in between * When the man jiggled a switch * With the first love taken * The old forsaking the gun * Killers die hard * And they always die alone * As they call from glory * To take gold plates from the sun
