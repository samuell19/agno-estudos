Hey, check this out. Hey, check this out. She's been working the night shift. Ain't she freezin'? She's so wacked, she thinks she's in the Bahamas. Here she comes. You been partyin', baby? Shit, I been partyin' all the time. L'm a party girl. Well, party on home, baby. Take a little rest. Rest? I don't need no rest. L'm on the case, you know? Y'all wanna come party with me? Not now, baby. I got somethin' fine... for New York's finest. Well, we're on thejob. Shit, l'm on myj-O-B too... just like you. Shit, an importantjob. Y'all just take a look at this. What is this, the gunfight at OK Corral? As long as there's cop killers around, l'm gonna be ready. Don't make no difference how many guns you got. You only got two hands. Murphy don't need no hardware. All you gotta do is breathe on the suckers, and they give up. You can't get your man with six bullets, you might as well go in with a tank. Anybody know those two guys? Loomis was in the car with us, wasn't he? Just out of the academy. The other one too. He was a rookie too? What was his name? What difference does it make? They still had their coffee in their hands when they got it. The head and the face, almost point-blank range. Sounds like a hit. Look at Beau Brummell over there. They could be dropping bombs on the Bronx... and he'd be standing there figuring out whatjockey shorts went with his tie. Jealous. Typical bust-out cop reaction, you know? A guy's got a little style, tries to rise above his circumstances... and you gotta knock him. That's what we need, a cop with style. I ain't no 20-year man like you, baby. Look at the threads in there. l'm dressing for success. I got a self-image, man. Here he is, ladies and gentlemen. The Million Dollar Mouth. Wait until I cruise up here in my Bentley. Yeah, Bentley. Grab him! Get the needle out ofhis arm! - Hey, mofo, I ain't nojunkie, man. - Give me some help here! Come on. Knock it off. - Whafs the charge? - Indecent exposure. Just showing his face is indecent exposure. Next patient. Goddamn switchboard's out again. L'll take a look at it. Pantuzzi, I'll need a car tomorrow to get myjunk outta here. - You thinkyou can arrange that? - Yes, sir. We're gonna miss you, boss. In two days, you w0n't even rememberwhat I look like. Maybe in my last couple ofdays you can stop the bullshit. It's all right, though. You guys had it easy with me. This new guy'll cut you to pieces. Whds the new guy? Captain Dennis Connolly. I heard ofhim. He's a headquarters guy. Been kissing ass so long, he wipes his nose with toilet paper. 0y vay! A headquarters hero. I give him three months up here. We lost two guys on the 8-to-4 today. L'm sure youse all know about it. Got the reporters outside... and there's a special unit from downtown that's working on the squeal. They'll all be gone in a couple of hours, and we'll still be here. Now, until we clear this thing... we're moving targets. That's those of us that move. It's not a good idea to let the folks up here know... it's open season on cops. Now, you guys, evely one of you, got your stoolies. Canvas your sectors, toss everybody. And never mind from downtown. It's on us to get some information on this. It'll be our asses ifwe don't. Okay? Enough said. All right. Got a rape ofan 11-year-old girl. Suspect described as black male, 6' 240 pounds, still at large. Victim has provided a sketchy description. It's over at the desk. We got complaints on a crap game in back of St. Anselmds. The sisters called it in. Thafs sector Adam, Boyd and Williams. D0n't move it. Bust it. All right? We gotta let 'em know they leave the church and the grounds alone. Track star on Brockton. This is a skinny dude with felony shoes... and a World War I pilot's cap. Right? Snatching purses from the welfare ladies. Now, as you probably know, Captain Dugan is retiring. He's been replaced by Captain Dennis Connolly. We were gonna throw Captain Dugan a racket... but with the different tours it didn't work. S0 we set up a collection to buy him a present. Any of you wanna contribute, there's a kitty on the sergeants desk. Knock it off. You're dismissed. She never, ever went. - I did so! - You did not! The neighborhood will be full of stars with all these TV cameras around. People will be blowing each other away just t0 get 0n the news. You see a lot of fires 'cause they look real good on the tube. - A cop killing is a media event. - Big deal. Put a black border around his picture and give him an inspectors funeral. And people sending your ex-wife money from all over the country. She'd like that. Meanwhile, there ain't a chance 0f making a collar 0n this... with all these hooples around here. Look on the bright side, though. We get our names in the papers, right? We can be real serious on TV. With your good looks maybe you'll get to ball an anchor lady. Yeah? Ah, not with my luck. Ifit was raining anchor ladies, l'd get hit with Walter Cronkite. L'm going to fly! I want to fly! Mira. I d0n't want my blood to splatter all over you, my people. I know you're gonna miss me! Anybody know this guy? I do. He's my roommate, and I hope he breaks his stupid neck. Come on, Raquel. Don't you wanna kiss and make up? Hell, no! He stole my Donna Summerwig. - The bitch. - You the super? Yeah. Mind the car. I don't know about Carl anymore. I don't know what's the matterwith him. - What are you wearing, Chanel no. 5? - No, it's Windsong by Matchabelli. Carl! Stay away! Hey, Carl? Wait a minute. Come on now. Think it over, huh? You can become a star if you wanted to. G0 ahead. Put on the wig. Let's see what the wig looks like. He said to wait here. Tom Snyder! Tom! L'm coming down, Tom! Carl, wait! No! L'm coming down! Is Tom out here? ls Tom Snyder here? All these people. My people. I love you, my people. Oh, fix my wi g! Fix my wig. Oh, /'m a bad girl, badg/r/ Such a dirty bad g/r/ Beep, beep Yeah! Yeah! Stop it! Tom Snyder! I want Tom Snyder! Hold it! L'm a bad girl! Such a dirty bad girl! Last chance for /0 ve lneed the last chance / need the last dance For/ave - What happened? - Ajumper. We d0n't have psychiatric facilities here. So sedate him. - Send him to Bellevue in the morning. - Wheres your medical degree? Back at the house. Wanna come by and see it? Nurse, see ifthis guy has major medical. What are they gonna do with me, Murphy? - You d0n't need these cuffs anymore. - I d0n'twanna g0 tojail. You got it all wrong, Carl. - This guy ain't going tojail. - No way. Don't worry about it. Hey, Isabella. We ain't filing a complaint. just put him down as a patient. If you say so. See, Carl? Everything is gonna be okay. L'm all messed up. Ain'twe all? - We'll be back to see if y0u're okay. - Thanks, Murphy. It'll take about an hour. - Good. Let's g0 eat. - Bye, Andy. S0 long, Slick. Take care of yourself. So, what'll it be? Puerto Rican, Puerto Rican 0r Puerto Rican cuisine? Decisions, decisions. Isn't that our man up there? - The guy with the World War I cap. - I don't wanna chase this dude. The bi g, bad policemans is here, s0 d0n't rip nobody off. - Son ofa bitch! Right in our faces! - Lets get him. Murphy, Murphy, Murphy- You got a cigarette? - Why didn't you just drop the bastard? - Here. Oh, yeah, right. Shoot a purse snatcher. They'd crucify me. You say he pulled a knife, and we back you up. That's all you gotta do, Murph. You lay it on 'em. I know how to flake a guy as good as you do, Morgan. Y0u'll get a heart attack before you ever catch a nigger, Tarzan. What's his problem? He thinks l'm a liberal. Get back here, you motherfucker! My recollection d0n't recall it. I don't remember. What do you want? Captain Dugan's office. Don't you monitor the people who ask to see the commander? What ifl was a lunatic with a gun? Then you wouldn't be a police officer, Captain Connolly. Orwould you? What's your name, Sergeant? Kickin' ass and taking names, huh, Captain? Well, l'm Sergeant Anthony Pantuzzi. I got 22 years on thejob... and l'm ready to retire tomorrow ifl get a hard time from my new commander. I'll take the halfpension before l'll take any crap from anybody. Captain Dugan's office is over on the right... as close to the street as he can get. Thank you, Sergeant. Come in. Captain Dugan. - Connolly. - Yeah. You picked a great day t0 take over. This place wasjammed with reporters all morning. Page one of your first day up here. - You like press conferences? - TheyTe part 0f thejob. That's for sure. They put it out you volunteered for thisjob. - I did. - l'll tell you something. Y0u'll do better walking the beat in Beirut than you will here. Y0u're supposed to have some background material for me. Yeah, I got it. Block-by-block rundowns. Ongoing investigations, trouble spots... community people... personnel evaluation. L'm interested in the ratio 0f rookies t0 veterans. I didn't break it down that way. Two rookies in a car is always a mistake. S0 l'm going to be blamed for those killings? And l'll be blamed till they're cleared. How about corruption? Anybody on thejob now in my precinct is clean. Your precinct has the worst absentee record in the city... the most disability claims... the highest percentage 0f men 0n sick call... the least convictions per arrests, and there are no men on the take? S0 they toss a numbers runner for a couple ofdollars... turn a pimp upside down for some loose change. There's nobody getting rich up here. Theres nobody doing anything. These men aren't motivated. Motivated? I mean, this is Siberia, Connolly. Sixty-five percent of the men here have been transferred. We got the connivers, the slobs, the shirkers... guys who beat up the wrong guinea... who gave a diplomat a parking ticket... screwed a bi gmouth hooker or shook down the wrong peddler. There are plenty of good police officers in your command. Y0u're the one falling down on thejob. That's right, blame Dugan. Sure, let the politicians and everybody else off the hook. Blame Dugan. That's the easy way. You got a 40-block area with 70,000 people... packed in like sardines, smelling each other's farts... living like cockroaches, and that's Dugan's fault. You got the lowest income per capita, the highest rate of unemployment... and that's my fault. Why aren't I out there getting all these peoplejobs? The largest proportion of non-English-speaking population... in the city. Dugan's fault. Why ain't he out there teaching 'em t0 speak English? Four percent Spanish-speaking cops 0n the force. Hey, Dugan, get your ass out in the barrio and recruit. Families that have been on welfare for three generations. Youth gangs... winos, junkies... Pimps... hookers... maniacs... cop killers. - Y0u finished? - Yeah, l'm finished. L'm going to Florida, Connolly. l'm going fishing. So you can bring up your computers and yourslide rulers... and all your psychological techniques. I mean, this neighborhood'll bury you. There's enough dirt in this precinct to bury every smart-ass cop in the city. How about that fashion plate? Whats his message? What the fuck you talkin' about, huh? - The bitch is treacherous, man! - Keep it off the streets. I put her out on the line, and she don't come back with nothin'. She used to be the main whore 0n the set. - It's not that bad. - She could pull anybody. Pull 'em out of a goddamn Cadillac... doin' 75 on the FDR. But now she ain't worth nothin'! Nothin', the motherfuckin' bitch! You gonna run this guy a benefit? L'm not kidding you, man. The bitch is nuts, man. She been smokin' that angel dust, you dig? I mean, that shit'll make you crazy. I mean, I can't even deal with it! Just keep it off the street, huh? Let's run a nice, clean sector here. Come on. Yeah. I don't know you, huh? - D0 we sit in the same pew? - I guess not. Easy there, Wild Bill. Vmjust going for my wallet. I wanna show you my driver's license. That's a nice coat. H0w'd you like me to cut it open and let all the rats out? This coat cost more than you make in a year, motherfucker. He knows your name. I told you I was famous. - That's yours, huh? - Yeah. That's legally parked. - Oh, motherfuck! - That's a defective headlight. Oh, shit! Man, that's my car! N0 windshield wipers. Don't try to buy me, you scumbag! Try to grease me again, and l'll turn your head like a doorknob. Murph, slow down, man. Come on. - Keep it off the street! - Come on, Murph! Whats the matter with you all ofa sudden? Son ofa bitch thinks he can own me fora couple of bucks. Like he owns a lot of other cops. He'sjust doin' business. Like we do too, huh? We're living in a world we never made, my man. Keep it off the street! Everything3 cool. Get over here, bitch. Whats wrong with you, Charlotte? Now you're puttin' the man on me. What the fucks gotten into you? Get over here. You want it? What's all this lndianjunk? Well, the precinct is nicknamed Fort Apache. The men put that up, Captain. Guy goes on vacation, he brings back some kind of souvenir. It makes the place look like a fraternity house. - Take it down, Lieutenant. - lt's not a good idea, Captain. Let's see about gettin' this place painted. That's a problem. Painters won't come up here. We'll have to get those civilians out from in front of the precinct. Can't do that. Excuse me? This is the only place the old folks can go without getting mugged. It's the same with the mothers and kids. This isn't a police station. It's a fort in hostile territory. You understand? Fort Apache. Here's the final disposition. - H0w's he doing? - He's resting now. We're sending him to Bronx State. He'll be okay. You wanna go have a drink? Two hundred cops ask me out every day. Why should I say yes to you? 'Cause you say yes t0 all the others. I guess that makes you the only cop I say no to. My, you certainly have a way with women, don't you? - She's crazy about me. Can't you tell? - Oh, yeah. In an abandoned store right here there's a drug operation. We traced it to the hospital. Narcotics has got a man inside now. - The hospital? - Yeah. There have been reports 0f thefts 0f morphine... surgical cocaine, syringes. Also, sales of drugs in the hospital. These rookies could have stumbled on a felony in progress. Those guys were shot at almost point-blank range. Even a rookies gonna make a move if he sees somethings going on. N0 information from the street so far? Are you kidding? Anyplace else, a guy sees a cop get killed, he runs t0 the phone. Here, the doors close. There could be five people out there who know who did this. In a few hours, ten, maybe more. But not us. Up here, Captain, cops are like husbands. They're always the last to know. D0n't she know enough to come out of the rain? He didn't kill her. Must be our good deed for the day. - What was this all about? - Ambulance call. Sure d0n't like to g0 into dark buildings with cop killers around. Decisions, decisions. Okay, what's goin' on? Okay, hold it. Hold it. All right. Hey, kid. How are ya? Murph, how do you say "room"? Cal/e. N0, thafs street, I think. Sa/a. She's havin' a bamb/no. You speak English? Yes. - How old are you? - Fourteen. You know something about babies, then, 'cause I think you're having yours now. - N0. - Yeah. You have to. I know. You kept your coat on for four months. You didn't tell nobody. You can't hide it now. It's okay. We'll help you, okay? I gotta wash my hands. Make sure she don't pass out. Come on. You gotta help me. Come on. Come on. That's good, that's good. Come on, Nina. Come on. You're almost there. Come on. Push. Push. Keep trying- Here we g0. Here we g0. It's coming now, Nina. lt's coming. All right.

Nice cut 0n it. - What can I do for you? - l'm gonna cop a bundle. Get your money ready. Money, money, money, money. Okay, bro, what you want? You don't look too good. This will take it out. D0 two. lt'll straighten you out. Look, l'll catch you guys later. All right? I thinkyou guys are trying to take myjob. - Whats the matter with him? - Postoperative depression. Hejust delivered a baby. You all right? Oh, yeah. That's my 17th in 14years up here. Seventeen. You could almost be an obstetrician. You need a drink. I need a nurse. You supply the booze, l'll supply the nurse. You asking me out? Maybe. I get asked out by 200 nurses evely day. Why should I say yes t0 you? 'Cause you say yes t0 all the others. See ifyou can find your way back here at midnight. You take more time getting ready than my old lady does. If that's a proposition, l'm already engaged. - Sorry, pal. - Man's got a heavy date tonight. Man's gonna score. The man is seeing his fiancee tonight... which means the man's gonna get shut out. Back off. You're talking about the woman I love. You know what a nice Catholic boy means when he says he's in love? It means he ain't gettin' no cho cha. No cho cha for the kid. - N0 cho cha. - Not even a cho. You scruffy Irish potato eater. What do you know about style, huh? What do any of you know about style? Look at youse. L'm giving out a heavy message tonight with these clothes. What is that? The message is: Take me! Please take me! A whole year we've been goin' out. l'm gettin' back pain from the anxiety. - Please! - Poor little baby. Please take me! Were gonna need a padded patrol car for this fruitcake. I didn't thinkyou'd come. I had to break a date with Charl/eKAnge/s. I hope you don't regret it. Hey, cowboy! Tough guy- Whafs he doin'? Going out with nurses now? It makes sense. He catches something from her, at least she can cure it. - Date night? - What'll you have? - Bacardi and Coke. - Me too. N0 beer? What is it, your birthday? - Make 'em doubles. - You won't get me drunk. - For how much? - My moneys on the lady. - You wanna join us? - Excuse me! She always gives me the cold shoulder. Now all ofa sudden she wants to talk. Shdsjealous. Theresa. Shh, Andy. I got pizza. Pizza. Come on. Open the front door. Goon Andy, it's after midnight. Just let me come in for a minute. Open the door. For G0d's sakes, my parents are sleeping. Listen, ifyou d0n't wanna do nothin', how come you wear outfits like that? You want me to wear a cop's uniform to bed? Let me come in for a second. One second. Come on. Don't get crazy on me now. Nah. D0n't worry about it. just gonna eat the pizza, I promise. Don't worry about nothin'. - Bad? - Yes. I can't believe l'm on a date. You don't do this all the time? How about never? Why? You married? No, l'm not. Well, l'm not married now. I was. I d0n't know why l'm having so much trouble with this. L'm divorced. lt's no big thing. - Kids? - Yeah. Three girls. So what about you? So what about me what? Well, tell me a little something about yourself. That's what y0u're supposed to do on a date, isn't it? Yeah, only I d0n't like talking about myself. Well, I d0n't like talking about myself either. S0 let's talk about two other people. I'll tell you aboutyourself, you tell me about myself. The one whds right wins a drink. Okay. You start. - Square business? - Tell it like it is. Poor family. You're the oldest. You got a lot of brothers and sisters. You got a brother in thejoint. Your mothefs sick. You got a scholarship to nursing school and did real good... but you can't get a job anyplace but here. - How am I doin'? - I don't know yet. You smoke a little reefer, fool around a little bit. You ought to get married, but the selection ain't that good. Finished? Yeah. You come from three generations of cops. Your grandfather and your father and your brothers are all cops. All your friends are cops. It's a good thing there are lady cops, or you wouldn't have any sex life. You get drunk every night. You think all men are thieves and all women are sluts... and you don't trust anyone but your partner. It's my round. No. The drinks are on me. Theresa, am I stuffed. You c0uld've at least had one piece. It w0uldn't kill ya. No, l'd just gain a hundred pounds. "L'd just gain a hundred pounds." - We'd work it off. Come on. - Andy, stop it. My parents. They're sleeping. D0n't worry. My father gets up evely night for Brioschi. Oh, man. If your fathefs st0mach's gonna mess up my sex life, forget about it. Come here. Yeah, l'll come here. Don't you think I want to? I don't know. Do you? I do. I do! Can't it wait till we're married? Wait until we're married? No, see, you don't understand. You keep forgetting that l'm a cop. Any day that I g0 to work could be my last. - Today we almost got blasted. - I dontwanna hear it. Five guys opened fire. They started blastin'. Now, that's more like it. How long have you been a cop? Eighteen years. It's too long. You ought to at least be commissioner by now. You sound like my ex-wife. No, I made detective. I got a gold shield. Ijust didn't keep it very long. What did you do? Come on. What did you do? I nailed this guy on Westchester Avenue. He was going about 65 miles an hour. He's really drunk. He's all over the road. And he was a local hood. He was a guy that I put in before for extortion. S0, anyway, the next day, the guy gets out. He drives his Caddie by, gives me the finger. S0 on this one hejust laughs in my face. He 533/5? "A Summons?" He said, ?My God, my lawyer's gonna take care of this tomorrow, you jerk." So I thought, I said... "The guys right, l'm ajerk." S0, I leaned across, grabbed his car keys and threw it in the sewer... and said, ?See ifyour lawyer can take care of that tomorrow." This guy isjumpin' up and down and yellin' at me. And... - I ate his drivefs license. - What? Yeah. And right after that, I ate his registration. The registration tasted better than the driver's license. Well, he said... ?My lawyefs gonna make one call and y0u're finished.? I said, ?Finished?? So I laughed in his face. The lawyer made the call... and they took away the shield... and put me back in a monkey suit. Well, the moment of truth. Yeah. Hey, listen, thanks for the drinks. Anytime. I guess I ought to be flattered that you're not makin' a move on me. It means you respect me. I d0n't g0 to parties where I ain't invited. You want an engraved invitation? - What is that, a walk-up? - And l'm on the fifth floor. Let's climb that staircase t0 paradise. Let's go to your place. You got any other names besides Murphy? Hey, don't get personal. I'll remember you said that when we get to your place. What? Johnjoseph Vincent Ill. Satisfied? Big name. Ah, big man. We'll see about that. You d0n't need a girlfriend. You need a maid. Ain't they the same thing? Uh-uh, baby. You're in the wrong century. Yeah? Help, police. L'm glad we did it. Are you? Glad we did what? Wise guy- Did you enjoy it? Yeah, it was all right. Itwasjust all right? There wasn't enough pepperoni on it... and the anchovies tasted like shoe leather. I didn't mean the pizza. I meant me. Oh, you? Yeah, yeah, you were okay. But there wasn't enough pepperoni on it... and the anchovies tasted like shoe leather. Shut up. just shut up. Johnjoseph Vincent Murphy Ill. You called? J-J- Yeah,j.j. That's what l'm going to call you from now on. No, you ain't. Murphy- A big Irish cop. How can you work in a neighborhood like this? You think I can't understand these people? The Irish are a lot like the Puerto Ricans. They are the Puerto Ricans 0f England. They like todrink and dance and sing... make love. L'm talking about the ones 0n the other side. Something happens to them when they come over here. They become a bunch 0f ti ght-assed priests... orward heelers. What the hell am I talkin' about? Son ofa bitch! I have to pull offthe highway into thisjungle. Come on! Hello, lover. You wanna go out? Come on. Let's take a little walk. How much? Well, ifl was sellin' it, baby... you sure couldn't afford it. But l'm gonna give it up... 'cause I likes you. How you doin'? This ain't a motel, baby... but it'll dojust fine. It looks okay to me. Nobody can do it like I can. Come on down. Sit right there. Yeah. Yeah. "Scorpio. Recreation will leave a potential for employment. Money comes in earlyjune. A fantasy comes true in September.? This is the life. - Yeahjust d0n't get too used to it. - Tough guy, huh? That's right. You're not tough. Y0u're a pussycat, just like me. My water's boiling. - N0! - Yes. Hey, punk. Man, what a racket. You know what the number was yesterday? - What? - Number 444. Except for a little single action, we cleared 3,200 bucks. Sometimes I think bookies have a patron saint. You'll pray to that saint when they bust your little operation. Maybe it'll get you 90 days instead 0f a year. Y0u'rejust uptight because you didn't get laid last night. - What are y0u,j0yce Brothers? - Leave me alone. Hey, Pop, would it be a first-class piece of detective work... to assume y0u've been downstairs pressm' the grapes? I got four barrels ready for Christmas. I got this guy all the way fromjersey ready t0 buy my wine. My brother's a bookie, my fathefs a bootlegger. I could make a fortune shaking down my own family without leaving the house. What are you laughing at? Knock it off. Don't start with me, punk. Whats this South Bronx Pe0ple's Party that keeps comin' up? TheyTe disco revolutionaries. You know what I mean? They got federal money to open a storefront on Fox Street. They make a lot of hate-cop noises. They preach armed revolt... but they spend most of their time ballin' white chicks from Scarsdale. Dacey, you followin' through? Yeah, we're gonna pay 'em a visit. Might go to Scarsdale first. Might as well, for all the production we've been gettin' from you down here. What am l, a mind reader? You got 50,000 potential cop killers in this precinct. You want me to toss them all? I want you t0 bring the South Bronx People's Party in for questioning. That's what I want. The boss wants production. What we're gonna do is take a few anti-crime units out of each tour. You guys will be plainclothed, unmarked car. Mulhearne and Tessitore. Lane and Baker. - Corelli and Murphy. - Corelli don't got no plain clothes. Let him wear a tuxedo. What do I care? The idea is to make a lot 0f felony collars, okay? L'd like a minute, Sergeant. Hold it down, fellas. Hold it down. The captain has something t0 say, all right? We are making zero progress 0n the investigation... of the murders of our two men. This case must be cleared... even if we have to take extraordinary measures t0 clear it. Evely day that we lag is another day that we lose respect... in the neighborhood. Pick it up. Startin' on this tour... l'm gonna wantyou to start makin' arrests. All of you know of criminal situations that exist. Up until now, you looked the other way. Thats gotta stop. Every suspect that we bring in... will be questioned by the squad. We're gonna bring 'em in, book 'em... toss 'em and see what they spit out. And we w0n't quit until we get a lead. Now... I d0n't expect something for nothing from you men... so l'm offerin' a deal. You collar us somebody who gives us information... you get a week added t0 your vacations. Ah, whds gonna be minding the store when were all on vacation? Sir. I don't follow you. Well, we could all g0 around with our noses buried in the penal code... we could make a hundred bum collars a day. S0 thejails will be full, the neighborhood will be empty... and meanwhile you ain't gonna be one step closer t0 clearing those killings. Ify0u're afraid to do some police work, Murphy... you can stay in and clean out the shit houses until your retirement. Shut your mouth, Murphy. As for the rest of you, my offer stands. Two leads? Two weeks, and so on. Call it bribery. Call it dedicated police work. Just get out on the street and bring in those cop killers. I won't question your motives. Okay, knock it off. You're dismissed. Let's go downstairs and get into something more comfortable. Come on. Plain wheels, plain clothes, plain brains. Plain, plain. What are you always putting yourself down for, huh? Uh-oh. I feel a lecture coming on. You need one. I appreciate you more than you do yourself. - I can see your hidden potential. - You got good eyes. A guy like you with all you got goin' foryou? Shit, you could conquer the world. Instead you keep holdin' yourself back. You gonna be my guru, huh? You gonna tell me how to release the hidden powers within? I tell you.

I wouldn't bother you ifitwas in Philadelphia. Special Investigations sent some people to that clubhouse and they went to war. We've had three 10-135. The cr0wd's heading for the precinct. Call evely available car off patrol and get some backup from Borough. Hey, you got a filthy mouth. What happened here? We went in to question them, and they started to give us a hassle. Why weren't my desk officers informed about this? Why wasn't I informed about the following those people have here? You sent us out on this. You should have told us what we were getting into. - Name, please. - I ain't tellin' you my name. We ain't tellin' you nothin' till you tell us why we've been arrested! They cooperating?

Come on, let's take a little nap with your friend down here. - Look at this over here. - What? Look at this. Young love up on the roof there. It's a cheap date. Instead of going to the movie, they walk up on the roof... and watch the buildings burn. Uh-oh. Would you look at them muffs. Yeah, Morgan and Finley, what a couple of hotshots, huh? Hey, Morgan! They can't hear you. What? Hey! Hold it! Morgan, you asshole! Leave the kid alone. Hey, he didn't do nothin'. Hold it! Put me down! - Hold it! - Hey! Did you see that? I didn't see nothin'.

I mean, y0u're not gonna g0 out and do something crazy, are you? Like what? I d0n't know. That's what scares me. Let's go out for a drink. You know, l've been on thisjob 18 years. I think evely minute ofit is 0n my face. Ofall the blood, the beatings, the scams. Not here, Murph. People only know what you tell 'em. - You can fool anybody. - l'm lookin' you right in the eye. - You know what I see? - This ain't the place for this. I see that kid fallin' off that roof. L'm lookin' you right in the eye, and that's what I see. That'll pass. You know it will. I wonder what my face is gonna look like tomorrow. What the hell are you doin' in my car? The body was discovered after the fire. Death was caused... by injuries sustained in a fall. Now, we have witnesses who say they saw... two cops throw the decedent off a roof. Anybody got anything to say? I didn't throw anybody off a roof. I didn't throw anybody. Wait a minute. What day was that again? Donahue. D0n't tly to cover this with jokes. Sorry, Captain. Anything else? Maybe one of those witnesses threw the decedent off the roof... and they're tlying to lay it 0n us. That's occurred to me. Everybodys always looking to knock us anyway, Captain. Especially up here. People d0n't appreciate cops up here. L'm aware of that. Ijust wanted to g0 on record with you men. I'll g0 straight to the wall with you on this... as long as l'm satisfied that you're clean. That's all. Murphy, you wanna hang in fora second? I didn't hear any denials from youjust now. I d0n't like suckin' around in public. I want you to look me in the eye and say you know nothing about that homicide. I didn't throw no kid off no roof. And you don't know who did. Are you askin' me 0r are you tellin' me? Get outta here. What happened? What did he say? Nothin'. He took me off his Christmas list. Quit foolin' around and tell us what happened. - Listen-- - Hey, hey! Will you g0 to your room? The man don't feel like talkin' now. So they bring this guy out. They hoist him up. His hands- His hands are tied behind his back. He's got 95 bullet wounds. Hey, Murph, come down here and join the party. - Where you goin' with that? - l'm taking your beer down here. Leave it! Sure. Collection time. Okay, girl, come on. G0 on, mama. Get the money ready. This man needs some bread. She's all right. She'sjust a little too high. Got yourselfa new old lady, huh? Hey, baby, what's happenin'? D0n't worly about her. She's okay. I ain't worried. - L'm interested. - Hey,j0se. Everybody knows you got a joint. Lets get down to business, all right? Come on, hustle. Get the money. Get the money! Move! Jose, why d0n't you chill out, man? Stop messin' with the bitch. Shit, man. I think l'm in love. Hey, baby. Pretty little boy. Yeah, baby, that's me. Did you ever see a snake... little boy? Yo, Hernando, check this out, bro. Check this number out. A snake has a dance... and a snake has style. And a snake will sneak up on you every time... and give you that smile... with its tongue comin' out. Oh, yeah, baby, do it. A snake's a cold-blooded killer, baby. But you don't care... 'cause you're too busy lookin'. You goddamn whore! Drop that! She cut my face! - Bitch. - Drop it! You killed her! Oh, shit. She's dead. Oh, my God, she's dead. Shut up! lt's your fault for having her here in the first place. She's no pig. She's nobody, man. Wrap her up. Let's get her outta here. Roll up this thing. Get up. Get back! Get over there! Do it. Aw, shit. You gonna have a drink with me or not? Murph, what do you think of that son of a bitch, huh? Connolly. Captain Connolly. That clown they dress up as a cop. That fuckin' banana. Who does he think he's playing with, some chickenshit rookie? I been on thejob too long. You know what I mean? Yeah, they may get me for coopin' or scorin' a little nooky on the side... or maybe even shakin' down a bodega. I never said lwas the smartest guy in the world... but when he comes up with this phony witness shit-- They got witnesses, Einstein. Deaf and dumb ones, right? Real live ones. The kind that put you away. Hey, MUFPh! Murphy, come here! What are you talkin' about? They got the little chick that was hiding behind thejunk pile. What chick? Yeah, they got me and Corelli too. A-number-one police work. Poor kid wasn't bothering nobody, you throw him off the roof! You shut the fuck up! You fuckin' creep, I wish I was man enough to turn you in! You motherfucker, l'm gonna turn you in! - Shut your mouth! - Are you gonna write me up? You bring me out on something like this? I gotta keep two cops from killin' each other, huh? ?Write you up,? you piece ofshit. You're lucky I don't shoot you. Now, get out of here. Go run your car into a tree. Get your fuckin' hands off me! Get the fuck off! Get him home. You call in sick tomorrow. I don't need nobody to take me home. Nobody! G0 on, break it up! Shut up! All right, man. We'll take care of the window tab. All right, let's get the hell out of here! Breakfast time. How'd you get into this? Clendennon called me. I figured y0u'd be up here. - Here. - You like being a den mother? L'm your friend, right? S0 I look out for you. L'm glad he called me. L'm givin' Morgan and Finley away. You gonna back me up? Why not? They killed that kid for no reason. - TheyTe no good anyway. - I know that. SQ? So I can't be a stool pigeon. The kid's dead. We can't help him. We'll just make trouble for ourselves. S0 wejust let those two guys get away with murder, huh? Another Puerto Rican is dead. Why worry about it? - I didn't say that. - lt's the neighborhood, it's the world. It's this, it's that. People get shit on so much, a little more don't make no difference. - I didn't say that either. - Were cops. We gotta stick together. We gotta cover each other. Meanwhile, boy, ifthat kid had been Irish or ltalian-- He w0uldn't be living up here in the first place. He'd be in Ireland gettin' blown away, or in Italy gettin' murdered by his own. You read the papers. We're not gonna change the world by givin' two cops away. Thafsjust talk, Andy, and you know it. We both know whafs right. We ain't got the guts to do it. Guts? What are you talkin', guts? You mean brains, don't ya? Shit, I'll g0 through fire with you, and you know I will. But I gotta live with these guys. You turn a cop in, and you're finished. Might as well quit the force and move out of the city. Even if you get a transfer, your rep follows you around. Itjust ain't worth it. Especially when you w0n't be doing anybody any good. I ain't a stool pigeon, Murph. l'm sorry. - Is that what l'd be? - These guys have families. - Is that what l'd be to you? - You want me to say it? You turn two cops in, and you're a rat, yeah. Come on, let's get out of here. Get something to eat, take a shower, y0u'll feel better. You d0n't wanna spend your day off in the Bronx, huh? Come on! That's rightjust pass me up like I was some drunken bum on the street. Better move that car before you get a ticket. They'll never take me alive. What happened to you? Tried to score with an orangutan. That's about your speed. - You still hungly? - Mm-mmm. - Y0u cold? - Oh, yeah. Thisyour lunch hour? L'm off today. D0n't you have anything better to do with your time off? Not really. L'm kind of a lonely guy, you know? - Poor baby. - lt's not that bad. I didn't even know I was lonely till I met you. What's that supposed to mean? L'd go out drinkin', chippyin'... sit at home, watch a ball game with a six-pack. Sounds like a nice life. It was okay. Then all ofa sudden l'd just get lonely and start thinking about you. Maybe l'm taking this too serious. I need a nice, hot bath. Bubble bath. I save it for when the kids come t0 visit. And they all wear pants In the southern pan' 0f France There, you look like a Hollywood starlet. Want to take my picture? L'll take your picture. You look like a little kid when you do that. Where you goin'? Home, man. Can't stay here forever. Sure, you can. Then it wouldn't be as much fun. Speak for yourself. Go back to sleep. You're sweet. - Whats the matter with you? - Nothing. Ijust have to get back home. I know you like me. I have to leave. - D0 you have to get high? - What are you talking about? I saw those track marks on the back of your legs. When you sleep with a cop, you got no secrets. Yeah, man, I wanna get high. I wanna get down right away. Can you dig, baby? You cops are weird, you know. Like you see everything, but you don't know anything. Do you wanna get high? Look, you think l'm ajunkie? You think l'm strung out? You see, that's what I mean. You could stay in this neighborhood forever and you'd never understand. I get high once in a while... just like GVGWOHG else in the hospital, even the doctors. - Like GVGWOHG else in the countly. - That's right. Everybody else in the country don't stick needles in their veins. Smack's like a vacation for me. You know? A few hours floating on a raft in the Caribbean. I don't take a vacation every day. I don't need one. In other words, l'm not ajunkie, okay? Yeah, well, I know what that kiss means. L'm gonna drive you home. How 'bout we get out of the Bronx some night? - Sounds good. - Go downtown, see a show. - Sure. - Little change of scenery. It stays in your head no matterwhere you go, though. You know, sometimes l'll be someplace... and l'll turn real fast... and l'll think I see blood all over the walls like in emergency. Or I'll see an old man sitting in a park... and, like, for a second, his mouth just kind of flops open and he's dead. People pass you, and they're laughing... only you think they're screaming. Yeah, some things you can't get out ofyour mind. You know that kid? You know that kid that was killed the other day? Thrown off a roof. Y0u're not gonna tell me you did it, are you? That's a relief, 'cause we figured it was cops. You did, huh?just like that? Yeah, people were throwing garbage down 0n them. This kid wasn't doin' anything. My partner and I were on the next roof. Two guys from our precinct... come in and threw him off. You understand what l'm telling you? I mean, I know who killed that kid. You asking me what to do? I don't know. Just make it easy on yourself 'cause it doesn't make any difference anyway. Y0u're never gonna bring that kid back no matter what you do. - If you rat out those two cops-- - Rat out, huh? That's what y0u're talking about, isn't it? If you'd seen my brother throw that kid off a roof, there'd be no problem. You'd arrest him in a second. It's only 'cause they're cops that you got this conscience about it. - Is that wrong? - Let me off. Don't talk like that. Let me off. - You d0n't live here. - l'll walk the rest ofthe way. - It's raining. - Let me off! Good-bye, baby. Will I seeyou again? Sure. Sure, ifyou want to. That bitch from the hospital, she's with that cop again. Gettin' it on with him, huh? She's gonna lead him right to us. Fuckin' slut. Yowrejustjealous, that's all. Jealous? What would I want with a slut like that? L'm not talkin' about the bitch. l'm talkin' about the cop. He's more your speed, rightjoselito? Come on. Cut that shit out, man. L'm gonna take that bitch off the count. You know, that'll get to you. Why d0n't you just relax, man? You get too excited. Why d0n't you let me take care ofit, all right? I mean, the man is on the case. What you gonna do? I ain't gonna do nothin', man. You gonna burn her? No, my man. She gonna burn herself. Come here, man. This is the real deal, Neal. This ain't no wack attack. L'm gonna rock herworld. L'll make her panties twirl. Straight from the cooker without a chaser. Yeah. This is hers. That is hers. Hey, baby! Come on. Come in from the cold, man. How you been? You okay? Whats the matter, man? I got a message from your girlfriend. - She told me to give you this, man. - All right. S0, like, whafs happening, man?

Well, what is it? l'm not a mind reader. You got your stoolie. What does that mean? You have trouble spitting it out? Write it on a piece of paper. Slip it under the door. Morgan and Finley are the guys you want. They threw that kid off the roof. How do you know? I seen 'em do it. L'm a witness. Pantuzzi. Get the Bronx ADA's office 0n the phone. I want a district attorney and a stenographer here right away. You sure took your sweet-ass time with this news. What's that supposed to mean? Well, what does it look like? Isn't it funny? Being a stoolie is my last official act. You're a good cop. I d0n't thinky0u'd be good at anything else. L'm gonna run for president. What do you care? I need all the good cops I can get so I can run this precinct the right way. - The right way? - Yeah. The right way. That's by the book, ain't it? You made more waves up here in one month than Dugan did in five years... and did it get you your cop killers? What it got you was a hundred bum arrests... another burned-out building and a dead kid. Jesus, l've been draggin' my ass in and out of this precinct for 14 years. It's too much. I feel as burned-out as those buildings 0n Charlotte Street. I ain't doin' nobody no good. And you got your nose buried so deep into that book... you d0n't even see what's going on around here. L'm not proud ofwhafs happened up here, but I can see. I can see the people out there. Notjust the hookers, the pimps and thejunkies... but those people who are trying to build something up here. And I want them to know whds running this precinct. I want them to know that this precinct isn't a clubhouse with a freak show... but the house of the law and that the law means something... and that it's there to serve 'em. That's the book, Murphy. You got a betterway? If we can take the whole neighborhood and bulldoze it into the East River... and you and me with it. Bullshit! You want to quit? G0 ahead. l'm not built that way. That's nice, Captain. That's nice. You keep tryin'. l'm quittin'. You don't want this? Save it for the sweeper. - Thanks. - Thank you. You have to go down to the grand jury tomorrow. Yeah, I know. The men will know about it by then. They saw the stenographer comin' in here. They know l'm not dictating my life story. They know. Yeah. Anyway, hold onto this for a while. You can always throw it back in my face. L'm not going anywhere. Don't be too sure. I gave Morgan and Finley away. Yeah? S0 what else is new? I figured you would. - That means they're gonna subpoena you. - I know. - What are you gonna do? - Let me put it thisway. L'm not gonna commit perjury to protect those two bastards. - You could say you didn't see nothin'. - And leave you hanging like that? What kind of a creep would I be ifl did something like that? You know how I feel about you, man. L'd g0 up against the goddamn world foryou. - Were partners, baby. - Not anymore. - What do you mean? - l'm puttin' in my papers. What? Y0u're gonna leave me alone here in the garden spot 0f the Western world? Just can't hack it anymore. Look. Look at that. - You gonna let him get away with that? - You betcha. L'm a civilian now. I can look the other way.
