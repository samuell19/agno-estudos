- Calm down. - This guy needs oxygen and Bricanyl! First we'll give you some help with breathing. Then you'll get an injection here, In your arm . - I'll try to keep— - Quiet now, kid. Everything'll be all right. - They say it's asthma. - Asthma? Can't parents stay with their children in the hospital? - That's only in the children's ward and it's crowded there right now. That's just the way it is in summer. It's not my fault. My name is Sara. - What? - Sara. - My name's Nisse. - Yes, I know. This isn't a toy, so don't play with it You should only use it if you absolutely have to. Try to sleep now. Now I've got you! You can't sneak out and trick me any way you want! - I haven't done anything! - Don't lie, you piece of shit! Now it's over! - I haven't done anything!! - Do you really think he'd be running around pulling a drip? - Well, it must've been a different one. - He was only admitted five minutes ago! Out! - Little bastards, running around all day! Were you scared? - No. - Good. He's a bit crazy but not as dangerous as he looks. Sleep well, both of you. Old bastard. You're lucky you kept your mouth shut. - Isn't it dangerous to sneak out? What about the old man? If he had caught you ... Well Lelle, you've got company your own age again. Been a while. It'll be fun, right? - Seriously. Give it a rest! Lelle has to learn to get along with other children. - Yes, we've tried that. - Any trouble we'll separate them. And then we can take the new boy down as soon as there's a place free. - I don't like that. Given what's happened in the past. - If he gets someone he's comfortable with he can be moved to the children's ward. - Why would that be better now? - He's younger. Less competition. - Hello, what do you want? - Nothing. - Right, that's settled. Let's get on with it. Hi Nisse. I don't want nosy little brats around. Got it? - The doctor said I'd be able to join in. I build models a lot as well. At home, that is. - Scram. - I'm allowed to be here too you know. Hello. - You were lucky there you little shit. The craziest guy I've ever seen. Totally gone in the head ... ... Then he shakes like this. All the time. So damn stupid, totally lobotomized. - You don't know what that word means. - Yes I do. It means a piece of your skull's been removed. Then this morning a lot of people came and stared at us. Who were they? - Well, they'd have been doing the medical rounds. Yeah, maybe that's it. - There's a real sick old hag on the right. - How's the other boy then?- Sad. - Really? - Looks like he's trying to build something on the table. - There you are, you could help him. You're good at stuff like that. - I think he wants to keep it to himself. - So don't lend him your comics. - No, but you— - Yeah. - I want to go home. We talked to the doctor. - He's a total wimp. - You'll probably have to stay here for quite a long time. - Stay here? - They have to do a full examination. - What examination? - To find what it is you're allergic to. - I'm not going to stay here anyway. - We don't want that either . Here! Take it, then! Eat it with your parents, or it's not fair. Lelle's not allowed to eat sweets. Away from the war and starvation. Sweden. The Transport Workers' Union today announced blockade ... I can help you if you want. - I don't need you. - You can borrow my comics. Jump into bed. You're done. Now get to bed. No, but- - You can read it tomorrow. Sleep well. Good night. - Stop it. - Sweet dreams anyway. Sleep well. Good night again, boys. Good night, I said. - Good night. - Oh shut up. - She's pretty stupid, isn't she? She can't make up her mind when I should go to bed. Rotten bitch, nicked my sweets. - Shut up. She's the best in the whole world. One more. - I know. Thanks, Sister. - Sleep well, then. Where are you going? - None of your business - What if someone comes in? - Who's gonna come in? - What if Sister comes and sees you're not here? - Go shit yourself. Actually yeah, good idea. Keep her busy all night. What are you looking at? Nils Ekström? Come with me, please. we need to take some samples. There's more than playing and running around in a place like this! - Shut up, Carson. It'll be your turn next. Fucking zombie. It's not that bad. No worse than a mosquito bite. Here we are. - You can come in. Take off your shirt. - Be a good boy now. - Lie on here face down. We always start with a control solution. Has to be injected just under the skin. You stick it in, push until it's empty. You shouldn't go too deep. You won't see what he's allergic to. - Bye. - Bye. Wait, don't scratch. It only makes it worse. - No, leave it alone. - It won't itch so much. Can you help me make a couple like this? If you're up to it. Here. Like this. It's going to be an airship. A model of a Zeppelin. It might be easier if we tilt it. Gosh, that's lovely! - You'll have to eat in bed. - First you have to wait for the food. - And then don't sit at a table and eat. - An assistant will help, Mr Carson. It looks like a pigsty in here. I can tell you what it's like in Florida. Have you ever been to a Recreation Center? She would like that- - You're completely soaked. - What's all this? - I prescribed cold against itching. - Lelle. - Sister might be able to get a job there. Wouldn't that be fun for her? To travel around and see the world. - We have to get rid of this before the doctor sees it. - Are you listening, Sister? I said it would be nice for Sister to travel around and see the world. You have to be good though, Sister. They don't give "debit and credit" points over there. - You mean they employ just anybody, Mr. Carson? - The sea, the miles of sandy beaches. And at night, the casino. - Just like in Miami Beach. Milkshake. - What? - Yes, can you hear the sounds of the golf course? - I just said it smells good. - Never heard you say that before. - First time for everything! - Life can be so nice sometimes. - It can be nice. Right? - But there are no more ... straws ... - Aren't there? I'll go over to 55. - You carry on eating for now. I'll be right back. - Strange, I'm sure I saw a lot of straws somewhere. I'll be back soon. - There may not be anything left to do by then. Would you like to come along and have a coffee? - Well? Would you like that? Coffee in 55? - No, I don't really have time for that. The guys in the football team were asking about you. - You're very quiet ... What is it? - Can't we go in? I'm freezing. And then in the middle there. - There? Then that goes down there ... - There? There! - There? - Yes. - Where are you going? - I don't feel too good. I'm going back. - If only you could stay with us sometimes. It's good for you to spend time with other children. I'll call the ward so they can meet you. - He was stuffing things into his trousers. - I was not. - Yes you were. - No. - Yes. - You know you mustn't steal? Don't you? You do understand that? How would it look like if this spread all over the hospital? Let him go! What happened today— - Hold on. - Hello, Nisse. This isn't so good. - I didn't do anything. - That's not what I meant. Shame that Lelle got so ... difficult. He hasn't been nasty to you, has he? That's good. We were wondering if you'd prefer to move down with all the other children? - No? - No. No. Fine. Listen. Lelle could have done a lot of damage today. Both to himself and to another child. Mostly himself, in fact. Although maybe it didn't look like it. Since you're staying, you can help us make sure it doesn't happen again. The drip bottle mustn't be broken. He has to be connected to it all the time. Two hours without it is fatal. Will you help us? Good. See you later. - Bye. God ... Hello, Nisse? - Hello. I have to relieve the others now. We'll talk later. Fuck off! I don't want to see you! There wasn't any paper left. - I understand... Sorry for what I said just now. - It doesn't matter. - It gets me that way sometimes. - Yeah yeah. Come here. - Hello! - Hello to you. Get the newspapers over there. - What for? - You'll see. We'll use them tonight. Hurry up. Where are we? - It's a war hospital. This is where they perform surgery. Cool, eh? Don't touch anything. Come on. Big, isn't it? It'll be used if there's a war too. There's enough here to feed the whole country. And I'm gonna steal all of it. - All of it? We could sell it and become millionaires. - Tastes too disgusting. Nobody'd buy it. - They eat strange things in Italy. Octopus, sparrows , that sort of stuff. - They wouldn't buy it either. - Surely they'd eat it in Africa? - They don't have any money. - No, of course. - I'd have probably thought of Africa Can't let it rot here while people starve. The ship I built is a model. The real thing will be ten thousand times bigger and there'll be room for all this. I'll start building it as soon as I get out of here. Wait here. Lelle! What is it? - An ... an old man. - What? Don't be afraid. It's just my friend Robinson. - Robinson? - Yeah. We met on Friday. - What? - Oh never mind. I put the papers over here! New magazines are all he really misses, so I always bring some with me. He was in hospital for years then had nowhere to go. No friends. So he moved here. But that was a long time ago. Secret lift. Hardly anyone but me and Robinson know about it. Goes to the roof. This is where you'll land and load the ship. Wow! But you can't land here. - Have to watch out for chimneys, antennas You do it at night so no one sees you. - Great. Cool plan. We need to fix fuel and see how the ship works in the air. - But if there really is a war? And all the food's gone. - Worse letting people starve. Then it really is a war. Do you have asthma? - No, that's no problem. Isn't it hard to make fuel? - We'll nick the keys tothe lab. That's the plan. Can't we go to the youth centre? - No, don't even try. Off you go now! - He's got nothing to do either. - Can't you wait until Monday? I'm tired. Supposed to be finishing now. Can't you ask someone else? - Come on. Let's play tic-tac-toe in the kids' ward! The ones working there enjoy children. - You're hopeless. Do you know that? - Don't let them start any shit now. - Go to bed now, Carson. - Yes, yes. Come on. Fuckin' sand monkey. Hey! There you are! Here ... I got a scooter. We can borrow my brother's. - D'you have a helmet, then? - Yes, I've got two. - Look at him staring. - Just what he deserved! - Bitch! - Speak Swedish so we can understand. - You're always in my way. Lelle! What happened? - He'll probably die. - Get help instead. Okay, okay. Hold it, please. I'll get back by myself. Put the zinc in the flask. Fill it with salt water. And connect the wires to the battery. That's how the bubble of hydrogen starts. Got it? Hydrogen is explosive. If a little of it gets into the room and there's a spark ... Open the door. I know you guys are fucking around with something. No decent kids stay still like that. I didn't. Look, look ... - It's flying. - Of course it's flying. What did you expect? Not done yet, but soon it'll fly like a real zeppelin. - But how? - With an engine. The gloves are full of gas coming out here and going through the hoses— Listen to me! .It goes through the hoses and comes out here under pressure. - What was that? - The janitor. There! I'll put in a letter asking the finder to tell me where he found the ship. So we can calculate how far it can go on a single charge. - Oh ... Rumbled! Here you are. I've got a sweet tooth too . You miss home? Mum and Dad are coming tomorrow? - When are Lelle's Mum and Dad coming? - I don't know. - Doesn't he have any parents? - Were they good? - Yes. Thanks. Lelle isn't here and these just make me fat So help yourself. There... Lift! Has nobody ever told you that it's supposed to be quiet in a hospital! - Yes. - Well then! - Old bastard. - What did you say? I heard what you said! The ... the doctor will hear about this! Oh, you ... your ... Lelle ... Lelle. Look! - I can handle this. Try to go back to sleep now, Carson. - Should I get Sister? - No. - I'm ... not shaking anymore. - I know. - Not shaking. - So, Carson. Get to sleep. - I can't move. I'm going to die. I don't want that. - Try to sleep now. Everything will be fine tomorrow. He always falls asleep after a while. Then he forgets everything afterwards. He's going to have an operation. That's probably why he was like that tonight. You are so childish. Lucky you're going to the children's ward soon. - You'll be able to let off some steam. - What? - You're moving this afternoon. - What? What move? - Haven't you heard? - You two are going to the children's ward. - Me too? - Yes. It would be rotten to separate you, wouldn't it? - It'll be great, although I'll miss you. Can I have the thermometer now, please? - When? - This afternoon, I said. - The thermometer ... It disappeared. - The thermometer? - I lost my grip. - Lie still! - Will they have to cut you open now? - If they move us, everything's screwed. Nils, samples again. - Come on then. I haven't got all day. Where are all the syringes? - We don't use them any more. Good, eh? - So I got the injections for nothing? - I wouldn't say that. - Do I have to do everything again? - Yes, but now it's not so unpleasant. - Come and sit down. It won't hurt. - No worse than a mosquito bite, yeah? That's all for today. Are you dizzy? Wait, sit down. - My mouth's dry. - Sit here, I'll get some juice. That's better, it's fine. I can go now. Lelle isn't feeling well, so help him take it easy. He has to get some rest. If he gets worse he can't move to the children's ward. But you won't move until tomorrow now. - What a shame. But it doesn't matter. - You'll have to help Lelle pack. The cupboards have to be empty by morning. Lelle, how do you feel? Sit up. Sit up , dammit. I hate that bottle. - What's in it? - Grub, medicine and stuff like that. Check it out now ... Hide it. - Yeah? - How's Carson? How should I know? If you have questions like that, use your legs same as I have to. We're fed up of people calling and asking stupid questions. - How does it work? - I don't know, but it works. I got so I can ring wherever I want in the ward. Can you change channels for me, Sister? Can I have a glass of water, Sister? So it keeps going like that all the time. If you find this ship, tell me where. I'm Lelle at the Southern Hospital. The phone number is 6161000. - Put in 08. So they understand it's in Stockholm. In case it goes really far away No, it goes at the beginning. Didn't you know that? - Course I knew. - Otherwise it's good. - It's probably windy up there. The motor might take time to turn on. Best we put on some clothes. Is that all you have? - Yes. Here, you have to fold up your sleeves. What the hell's that? If you press four, it'll— - Is it working now, then? You can see it's wrong. It has to be wrong. It's still flashing. - Hell! Get all the patients out. This is the only way to the roof. - What if he's locked up? - Who? Robinson, of course. Quick, in here. - Hello. - Hello. Come on, I've booked. Come on. We are in a hurry. Holy shit! - See you at The Mill later. - How the hell can she? - They are probably in love. - Bye. - Bye. What a fucking guy. He nicked our bed. Help me, then. - There's no point. - We have to change back. - You can't be scared now just because she's with him. I mean- - Because Sara likes that guy. - I don't give a fuck! Where were you last Saturday? I called you but no one answered. I thought you would have come with me to the Ritz. We had a lot of fun. Me and Frasse and my brother ... who got hold of two girls. They may have been from Yugoslavia. They hardly knew any Swedish. Damn cute. Twins. Almost classic, that. - Hey, do you know Sara in 27? - Yes. - What do you think of her? - What do you think? Good looking, yeah? She had it with someone in the ward. Who the hell was that? It was some black guy, I think. No, not again. Can't you look under the sheets before dragging your beds down here. What the hell? You can't even keep track of the kids. Now I've got you anyway! What the fuck's this all about? - You'll pay for this! - Serves you right, you creep! Look out!. - Now you're gonna get— Wait till I get hold of you. Even your mother won't recognize you! There! Now I've got you! Just you wait... Just wait! - Take off the blanket. - Now, damn it, I'll get you. Come on! Now we'll grab them! Press! - What's this all about? - Out of here! Out you go! I'll handle this. Now they'll bloody get— The lift door! - Come on now! - Calm down, I've fixed this. - But they're getting away. - You think so? We almost made it anyway. - Thanks. - Sure. - Bye. - Bye. That was close. Will you be able to go any further? Good thing it's as high up as the ceiling. It becomes more real. - What is it? Lelle ... - I'm waiting here. - Lelle ... Lelle! Hurry up and drop it. Get up there fast otherwise everything is ruined. Sit here. I'll be back soon. Light up, then! - It went out. - No, wait and see. - Yes! - Yes, that's it. It's beautiful no matter what. - We have to go back now. - Wait. We managed it anyway. Come on now. Have you been to the 25th as well? And haven't found anything? Yes, but of course it's my responsibility. They're pissed off because we nicked the coat. Come on now... My God, it must be possible to get hold of them. The coat. Lelle, Lelle ... Nisse, out of the way. The drip doesn't work any more. Has intensive care been alerted? - Now we're in a hurry. - Someone get the lifts ... Move the beds. Well, are you moving too? It's a pity that when you finally start to recover, you should be separated. But it's the way it is in hospitals. I just wanted to look in and thank you. - Good that Carson did so well. - Yes, I'm so grateful. Thank you. I had help this afternoon about getting into a convalescent home. The doctor said that after such a difficult operation, -a few days rest is what's needed. What about your mate, then? He's in another part of the hospital now. - He's fine there. - Yeah. I wanted you to know, Sister, that I feel real gratitude for all the help. For all the care, for the entire staff ... - Work on it so you don't fall behind. Look ... Look, there he is! Hey little man! Glad it's over now. New English subtitles ... by jerremys and faxeholm1234. TNT February 2022
