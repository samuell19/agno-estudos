Did you see the star that fell, son? Mom, stars don't fall! These are meteorites. For me, they will always be stars. Julio when I was your age, my grandmother taught me that when you see a star fall, you can make a wish. Wow, really? Really, but you have to wish very hard. Only then the wish will come true. It has already worked for me. Oh, yeah? What did you wish for? I asked for the best son in the world. Wake up, you dick! C'mon! Fuck you, Alexandre! Come here, did you forget the school tour? Shit, man! You bastard! Xande, open up, please! My bus is leaving soon, man! Please... Tough shit What's up, daddy? Hi, kiddo! Come here, that girl at the gym was staring at you! - Come on! - Ah! Her mother is the one who's crazy about you. - Yeah... - You've got it going on, huh? - She's a hottie! - You can do it! Take it off. But, look, take your old dad's advice. - Hm! - Throw in that okra slime, go easy, you'll get it easy! - Okra slobber, then? - Easy-peasy. Easy? Like father, like son, isn't this right? Like father, like son. Where are you going, Julio? I have to get to school soon, Dad. But today is Saturday, kid! I told you, there's going to be that trip to research the marine fauna. It's worth a note... The guys took the opportunity to go camping, I told you. No, imagine that. Sit down, have a vitamin and I'll give you a ride. I'll give you a ride. Thank you. So, which beach are you going to camp on, in B?zios? It's Buzios, Virgens Beach. Beach of the Virgins! - You'll feel at home. - Fuck you, Alexandre! - Hey, big virgin! - Nobody called you out! - Your time will come. - I'm talking to my father. Stop it, Julio! Stay where you are! Dad, me? Alexandre started it! Never mind! Grow up, kid! For God's sake! Argh! The one who liked Praia das Virgens was your mother. It's beautiful there. We camped there once. You were little, remember? I remember the tents, the rocks... - Yes. - I remember everything. You were very small. I remember too. Ouch! Whoa! Oh, my gosh! I forgot I had skin care! ?! Your ride danced. - Damn it! - Let's get out of here. Hey, Professor! I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I ended up being late! I got held up, forgive me! You just lost a point in Biology too, in the quarter's grade, right? No, it's okay. I'll get a nine. Really? Just because of your arrogance, you lost another one. If you complain, I'll take another one! Shit, man! Oh, man! Look at this kid, all wrong. Hey! It had to be, right? Look at his face! Look at his face! Get out of here now. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. - I didn't mean it, I'm sorry. - You're out of here! You nerd! - Ole! - Nerd, huh? What's up, man? Did you grab her titty? Oh, fuck you, "Cabe?a"! Hey, if I were you, I'd enjoy it, that's as close as you're ever gonna get to a breast. Ah, man, did you bring your bezel? You want the bezel! - Thanks, Z? Luneta! - Here, take the bezel. I brought it. Dude, there's going to be a meteor shower, - from the Orionid, it's an Orionid! - Check it out! Check it out! Let's try to look normal for once in our lives, please? - For me. - For what? Since when do you care what these little girls, these little daddy's girls think? I don't care what these little girls, these little daddy's girls think. I care what Melina thinks. Melina is dating Douglas, man! Douglas! Douglas is an idiot, I hate Douglas. But he's an idiot who's older than you, richer than you, has a speedboat, a motorcycle, a car, has a house in Angra, he can drink and kill you. - I'm not afraid of Douglas. - Oh, are you? But I am, so stay away from him, because in the end things always go to the fat guy at school. And the school fatty, in this case, is me. Which is just like the red shirts in Star Trek, just gets in to get screwed, okay? That's why I'm investing in my culture, in my intelligence, in my erudition. Because when I become a millionaire, because every nerd gets rich, you know, right? They get the pretty ones today, but later they will want to be with us! They will dance in bikinis. And money in their bikinis. Dude, come on, you're sick. You have to get treatment. No, Douglas. You're not supposed to come here. I'm sure. She's my friend! I believe in her much more than I believe in you. It's okay... It's cool! All right, stop talking! Don't come here, don't call me, I don't want to see your face in front of me. Dude, come on! This isn't a shack. It's a woman's repellent. Check it out! As if we needed it, right? Speak for yourself. Says the guy who has only had one woman in his life, right? - My sister! - At least, I did. No, no. She's the one who got you, okay? My tongue has already licked another tongue, means that I am not a virgin mouth. Neither am I! Hey, "Cabe?a"! Wait! You never told me that. Oh, because it doesn't matter! What? I'm your best friend! Will you stop telling me this kind of thing? Hey, Brain, check it out. Seriously, are we friends or not? I kissed Liamara, okay? - You got the lizard! - Shh! That's why I won't tell anyone! Tsk! Ah... Sorry, but that's what we called her, but tell me how it was! My stud! My boy! It was in the fifth grade. Really? At Paola's party. What's up, man? We made out behind the curtain, nobody saw. What, big guy? Wow, it was a great kiss! I remember until today. Her soft hair on the back of my neck... For me, until today, kiss... tastes like passion fruit brigadeiro. - Oh, don't fuck! - Sorry, man. I thought it was humanly impossible someone would like Liamara. There! She had a fight with her boyfriend. Dude, you know who you have the chance with today? Golden chance, chance of your life? Who? Did they tell you anything? Right hand, Julio. Julio, right hand. What's up? Man, the rain starts at 7:34. What time is it, huh? - Time for me to mind my own business. - Huh? Sorry about the bus today, okay? Relax. Is that Los Hermanos? I don't know. It sounds like it. You know, every time I hear Los Hermanos, I get... - I hate Los Hermanos! - I hate Los Hermanos too! Okay. You were going to say that you like it. No, I'm serious. I... I... I was going to say that Manu Magalhaes wastes her time with Marcelo Camelo. I totally think so. Where is that friend of yours, with the bezel? He is there with his bezel. He is excited that there is going to be a... meteor shower, he likes those things. The Orionids? Do you know them? I kind of... love astronomy. Me too. It's my telescope. If you want, we can look at some stars. Don't worry. You don't have to. You know that what fascinates me most about the stars is that it is a tiny little dot, very tiny, very tiny, gets big, the intensity gets bigger, it gets stronger, taking on an enormous proportion, gigantic, creating a whole intensity, which... Oh, Mel Mel! I came here to talk to you. First, don't call me Mel Mel, because I hate it. Second, get out of here, Douglas! There, it's a lie from your friend Deborah that I hit on her. Camila told me. You hit on Deborah too. That's great! Oh, shit! Look, Mel, the important thing is that I came to be cool with you. Let go of me, Douglas! Let her go! Did you touch me, kid? Are you crazy, man? Do you want to die? Hey, Mel Mel! He's your little deer friend, huh? Leave him alone. I guess there's no need for a fight, right? We could just as well talk. Fight! I'm not going to fight with you, kid! I'll beat you up, I'll kick your ass! No, no! Oh, my ass! It's burning my ass! Hey, Julio! My grandmother taught me that when you see a star fall, you can make a wish. Ah... I wanted to be the coolest person in school. Holy shit! Julia! Are you crazy, Julia? Hold on! Let me in! This is my bathroom! I'm Julio. I'm Julio. What the fuck is this? I'm... I'm... I'm a girl? And hot. Julia! There, don't be surprised at what I'm about to ask you. - Do you see me as a woman? - No! Thank God! I see you as a spoiled, spoiled, bratty little bitch! - Get out of my way! - Alexandre, what happened to me? What happened to Julio? - It's me! It's me! Julius! - Julio? What Julio, Julia? Your brother, man! Come here, did you smoke pot again? I'll tell Dad. - I'll tell Dad. - Never mind. He wouldn't believe it anyway. Go use your bathroom! No, no, no. I'm not crazy. This is not my room. My name is Julio, This is not my life. I am Julio, This is a nightmare and it'll end with a pinch. - Oh, fuck! Oh, fuck! - Jujube, are you awake yet? No! No, dad! Come in, no. Open up, no! No, don't open it! Then get ready and come for breakfast. Wait a minute. Is there a room here just for clothes? Holy shit! Oh! Look at this kitchen. - What's with this hair? - Oh, shut up, Alexandre! This shirt... these clothes are mine. I don't have any clothes. Julia, your closet is seven times the size of mine. I'm in a nightmare, Alexandre. In my nightmare. So... you don't exist, this place doesn't exist, this coffee you're going to serve me now doesn't exist, Alexandre. So leave me alone here, in peace. "My life is a nightmare. You say that every day. I do, only today it's true. Take advantage of the fact that I'm in the middle of my nightmare to do something I've wanted to do for a long time, and that is to tell you to go fuck yourself in the eye of your ass! - You... - You're going to get it in the ass, Alexandre, and you're not going to do anything, because I'm in the middle of my dream. This coffee exists, all this... Shut up, Alexandre! Dad? She took my shirt, my clothes, everything! Let her go! But it's not possible! All day long this nagging! You don't let go of your sister, boy! Let her wear whatever she wants. At least she's not all transparent, showing off, like she does every day. Good morning my Jujube! Dad, why are you so... ...finished? Over! I just woke up! Taking a lot of medicine, why? Ah! Medication I take every day! Pressure, cholesterol, rejection of the saphenous vein. What saphenous vein? What saphenous vein! Last year's, daughter. Don't you remember? Here. Have you forgotten? This house is also a lot of stress, isn't it? Mrs. Julia. Stop picking on your sister, Alexandre! Grow up, kid! Oh... Oh, guys! Stop this discussion. Respect that heart! What the hell! Dad! Hey, Dad... You have to take care of yourself, dad. There's a gym in the condo, go there. I hate gyms. Especially this one in the condo, you know? That's not an environment. It's just a bunch of drooling old men, stuck-up old man, trying to fool around with the girls. This is ridiculous. - Julia! - What's up, Julia? How are you? It's Julio. Hi, Julinha! How are you? Good morning, Julia! Take a picture with me, kitten. Hi, Julia! How are you? Good morning, my princess! - Hi, Julia! Good morning! - Hello. This isn't happening. - Hi, Julia! - Hi, Julia! This really isn't happening. - Hi, Julia! - Julia! Let's work something out, huh? This isn't happening! Hi, Julia! Hey, girlfriend! - You look different. - I love your hair. - You're great... - Come here, crazy girl! - Wow, I love your look. - You look beautiful! - No, you are! - Really! - Is this good? - Yeah! Do you know about the party tonight? Marcinha is going to stay with Jo?o, she said so. - So what? - Hello! You're already with him! - Are you ok, my friend? - I'm... - You look weird. - I mean, I... I think I am. Oh, it's the chemistry test, right? Test? I've already set up the whole cheating scheme. E... ? rar? tar?!? I did my part of the Periodic Table on my thigh. Oh, I did my part too. You did yours, right, Jo? Huh? No, no. I don't paste, no. I... can I see it again? Just a little bit. What do you mean, you can't? It was your idea! Oh, it's just... It's easy, right? It's oxidoreduction. Huh? Until yesterday, you used to say "oxide". Good morning! Good morning! I hate you! Are you done, Julia? It was easy. And you didn't even cry today! I cry? Always! And you answered everything? How, Julia? I studied! On top of me? Attention, class! Just a warning: if there's glue at the bottom, I'll get it, ok? Hi, my Jujube! Hmmm... - Guys! - Oh, my goodness! - Holy shit! - Holy shit! Fuck, Julia! Come on! Are you crazy, man? You kissed me, that's... disgusting! I killed a class at my college, man! I skipped my Jujitsu, I skipped my Crossfit to come see you! I don't care! You kissed me! What's up, Julia? You called me! Me? Why? Because we are dating! Really, man, this is the worst nightmare in the universe! - Love, what is this? - Love is my ass! We used to be boyfriend and girlfriend, okay? It's over! The end! The End! Now, get lost! Get lost! Get out! Disinfect from here... Die, man! Wait! Wait, wait! Wait, Julia! That's the way you said it, damn it! It sounded like you were giving me a foot in the ass! You're kind of dumb, aren't you? It's a foot in the ass. Huh? But what about my feelings? - I shit myself. - Ah! Tsk! Hey, "Cabe?a"! "Cabe?a"! Wait a minute! - Did you talk to me? - Yes, dammit! It's just that... Did you, Julia, talk to me? Come on, "Cabe?a"? I never talked to you? Not since second grade. Really? Julia, the last time you spoke to me was at the school gymkhana, when we were ten! The sack race. I fell down, you jumped on me. On my bag. I mean, both of us. What? I did that? Man, that must've been pretty cool, then! No, no, no! No, it wasn't! My self-esteem was destroyed and... I have one smaller ball than the other because of it. It's okay, Little "Cabe?a". I think you have to get over it. Here's what you do: you take the good ball and get the ball forward! I'm sorry, man. Sorry, man. I'm kidding. It's the emotion of seeing you. I really wanted to talk to you, like... as a friend, man! I'm glad you're here! My little "Cabe?a"! The hottest tits in this institution! Get out! Look, I... I'm getting nervous. I don't want to make out with Douglas and pranks are bullying, okay? - I'm out! - No, man! It's me, "Cabe?a"! "Cabe?a"... Let me explain, man! Hold on! - "Cabe?a", stop running, man! - No, no, no, no, no, no. - Let me talk! Stop right there! - Stop! Stop following me! - I don't want anything to do with you. - I'm not following you. - I want to talk to you. - Stop it! I really need to talk to you! - Talk to you about what? - Ouch! How can I tell you that? It's... I... I'm a guy named Julio, trapped in the body of a girl who... is this Julia here. Oh, I get it. Oh, thank God, "Cabe?a"! Are you a lesbian? No, you mule! Ah, mule! Go... "Cabe?a", I came from a parallel reality, where I was a guy named Julio, and you were my best friend. Didn't they already catch you with marijuana? Shh! Dude, stop it! - No. There's weed in there. - Stop it, man! There's a fight going on. You're tripping, you're crazy! Brother, pay attention! I'm a man! And you're my best friend! Girl, please. You're really scaring me! Stay away from me! Damn! You're a pain in the ass! "Cabe?a"! I know everything about you. You know nothing! You have the entire X-Men collection, number 128, signed by Stan Lee. Ah! Everybody knows that. You have a bunch of porn video folders on your computer, "Cabe?a"! Ah! Who doesn't? Yeah! Who would know you're into Lady Gaga on the sly? - Whoa! - Right there. Because of her voice! She sings a lot. And that doesn't prove anything either. You know what? You were with Liamara Lagartixa. Did she tell you? No! And neither did you, to anyone. Only me. In another life. That makes it difficult, doesn't it? No, it doesn't. Do you remember Paola's birthday, behind the living room curtain? You remember her soft hair on the back of her "Cabe?a". And, for you, until today, kiss... tastes like passion fruit brigadeiro. Stop, stop, stop! Calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down. You said "the person". I said it, man. That's exactly what I said. Instead of asking the shooting star "I want to be the coolest guy", you asked to be "the person. Hum-rum. Dude, why didn't you ask for a billion dollars? or, I don't know, to be Hugh Jackman? I didn't know that would work! But then why did you ask? I messed up the order, man! What can I do? I went to sleep, I woke up a pot"Cabe?a" skank! Hello? No. No, no, no, no, no, no. You don't understand, man. You're the great Julia Martinez. You're the coolest girl in school. You're a myth! - Really? - I'm serious! You're famous, you've had sex with half the kids in school. You only date older guys and you're dating Douglas Casolari. Dude, change the subject. I'm not dating anyone. Okay, okay! Come here, I want to show you something. ?. Dude, come back, come back. Why? "Hillary Clinton wins US election." What a bizarre world! Why? Because, where I came from, the one who won was Donald Trump. Trump? What about my bizarre world? Okay, "Cabe?a", go back to What do you want to show me? You caught Justin Bieber when he came to Brazil. Oh... Dude, check it out. Let me show you this here. You have 300,000 followers on Snap Chat. And a make-up channel on YouTube, with three million subscribers. Hello, friends! How are you? For those who don't know me, I am J?lia Martinez, the biggest channel in Brazil. And today I will teach you to do a top make up, "incri", top?ssima, for you to make your heart beat faster at the disco, inspired by Kylie Jenner! Guys, remembering, okay? That make-up corrects the beauty on the outside, because what really matters is what we have here, inside our little hearts, okay? That's enough for me. That's not what I asked for, man. I wanted to be a nice guy, not a retarded YouTuber. Relax, man. Now... you're in, right? From where? The building? Dude, come on. You're... You're hot, right? - Stop saying that! - Why? Because it's really weird to hear that "I" am hot. My "Cabe?a" still thinks like a man, man. And you're my best friend. It confuses everything. So, "Cabe?a", don't tell me I'm hot. Tsk! So can I hold your tits? - What is it, "Cabe?a"? - Quickly. It's just a little trick. - No, man! Get out of here! - Or an arm rub. I'll shove your face up my ass and fart. Do you want to? Oh, fuck! No! No, no! I won't even pull over here, okay? My body, my rules. Fuck! Now I understand everything. Dude! But it's not even your body! Yes! Yes, "Cabe?a", but I'm in it. Excuse me! Man, you know what's missing here? We don't have any "brodagem" here. Are you really my best friend? Because if I was your best friend and turned out to be a really hot woman, I'd let you take my titty. Or... I would at least show you my right nipple. That is the dumbest thing I have ever heard in my life. Both of them. "Cabe?a", are you all right there? No, Renata. Don't come here! ?! Look! "Cabe?a"! You have a woman in here. Yeah, so what? I never thought I'd see the day. What do you want? My iPad back. You're the great Julia Martinez. That's me. I used to date a friend of yours. She spoke very highly of you. She said you got a piercing together. How's that piercing? Piercing? Hey, avatar froggy, get out of here. Sweaty little piggy. Nice to meet you. "Cabe?a", is that your sister? Is that Renata? Is she a lesbian? Do you have to answer? Holy crap! What is all this stuff about piercing that she said? I don't have a piercing, no. - Don't you know yet? - You have a piercing. You have a piercing. It's cold. I didn't feel it, man. It's there. There, where? There in the... Uh! In your... - No. - Yes! - No! - Everybody knows! Man, I can't have a piercing. My dad would kill me. - You haven't looked at yourself yet? - No! - Why not? - Because I haven't, man! Because I didn't, because I didn't have the courage, because you're not the one who woke up with an extra hole today! Hey, so... Look now, hey. Fucking hell! Fuck! How nervous, you have a piercing, "Cabe?a"! How can someone do that to their own body, man! How nervous! I want to take it out! Calm down! Calm down. A friend is for these things. Drop your pants and I'll help you. - Pull your pants down! Get out, damn it! - I'll help you. I'm a professional! - What a professional! Get out of here. - Let me give you a nudge. A poke. I'm gonna poke at the dark side of your strength. - Turn around. - I'll give you a nudge. What's that? It's "peniform." - Get out with it, man! - Ouch! You have to help me, "Cabe?a". You have to find a meteor shower, a shooting star, anything. I need to make this wish and become a man again. All right! All right! I'll help you out. You said you had a telescope, right? In the other life, right? Because in this one I have nothing. I have the room from The Little Pony. Where's this shitty music coming from, "Cabe?a"? It sounds like it's from your backpack. For Christ's sake! Of course it's mine, right? It had to be. Holy shit, "Cabe?a". Melina is calling me, dude. It's normal. She is your best friend, her. Yeah? Hello? Bestie, how are you? Are you ok? I'm fine... The whole school is talking about you and Douglas. Man, did he cheat on you again? I don't know. Do you want to... go out? I don't know, to talk to me? She wants to go out with me. Go, go, go! Go, go, go! Hello! Ju! Hi! Hi, girlfriend! What is this outfit you've chosen? Ah... Nothing. I tried to imitate the look look of... of Tsc! From Thammy Gretchen. Yeah. It's pretty bad, but that's okay, because we're at the mall, you can buy anything. No. I don't want to buy anything, Mel. Wow, you look really bad. I'd like to sit over there and have a drink. We'll have some later. I have to go to that store. I told you last week. I don't want to go to any store today. Julia, 20 minutes in the fitting room. I'll skip this one, Mel... I only have today to buy panties. Then let's go! Let's go. Come on, Julia! Uh! Sorry! I'm sorry! Sorry about that! I'm sorry! I'm so sorry! - Is it all right? - Everything's fine. Hi, mom. I'm with Ju at the mall. I know, I saw my grade in math, I don't know what happened. I study, but, at the time, I get a blank. Mom... Okay. Okay. Got it. Mom, can we talk when I get home? Okay. Okay. Then we'll... Bye! Julia, are you okay? Yes. Heel You're kidding, right? You were the first to wear heels, when we were, like... ...eight years old. It's Douglas. Aren't you going to answer it? No! I broke up with him. You stay away from him too, okay, Mel? Of course I'll stay away! I keep my promises. - What promises? - From the camp, that no man would ruin our friendship. That camp was pretty crazy. Yeah. Yes, it was. Remember when we kissed? Play like that with... Play with me like this... we... We what, Melina? Julia, you're acting strange today. I was a BV, you had already kissed halfway through school, you taught me how to kiss... we kissed. If you want, we can... practice... kiss again. Are you crazy, Julia? Are you crazy? I am... It's me, crazy Julia here! Your friend, very crazy. Ah! Miss, a coffee for us here. Ah! Crazy... What the hell... Jujube! Dad! Here, Dad. I'm sorry, okay? It was Melina who made me spend all that. I don't know what I was thinking. - I'm really sorry. - Imagine that! At least you came home. Thank God! Always the same excuse. - Be cool, Alexandre. - But... Grow up, kid. That's right, dad. You can spank me. I deserve it. Hmmm... You haven't spent much. Hello? Hey, Dad, that's a fortune. That's not fair. You gave me the biggest lecture because I bought a Blu-ray box of Lord of the Rings, without your permission, on sale! When was this? You bought a Blu-ray box. Never mind, Dad. Daughter, wait a minute. Open your father's eye. You're smoking pot again! Oh, my! Your boyfriend, Douglas. He's here. For you, honey. Ouch! What's that? Come on! What's up, Julia? I spent a lot of money on those flowers, brother! Fuck you! You're mad at me because I cheated on you with Luana, aren't you? Who's that? No, man! I don't give a shit about you either. You know what the deal is? I'm taking a lot of supplements, man. My testosterone level is way up! I spend my day "big time", brother, with the biggest boner. You don't know how hard it is to be a man. Ha, Douglas! I do. I know how it is. Get your hand out of there. But, hey. Oh, man. She doesn't do it the way you do... that. "It"? Ah... You tied yourself up. - It was there in the car, there... - Stop talking! I don't even want to try to imagine what "it". Let's do it over there, real quick, again? You're kind of slow, aren't you? Read with me then. I don't want anything with you. Go away. Show? Show! Show! Show! Home. Let's go. Jujube, my love for you, baby, is like my creatine, hard. Hard. How can a woman stand it, man? Damn it! Hey, Julia! Forgive me, go! I'll do anything for you. Anything? There, there, there! It's started! Go, go, go! There! It's started! Order up, man! Hold on, hold on, "Cabe?a"! Where are you going? I'll stay away from you! A meteor will fall on your face! I don't want to die. I don't want to die. Order up! I want to go back to being who I was! I really want to! Ah! Damn it! Say it right, man! I want to go back to being Julio again! Julio! Julius! Julius! Why do you throw yourself on the floor? It doesn't make any sense. It's my way here, okay? Leave me here. I'm doing business my way. Don't get involved here. I want to be a man again. There, you two, there. Doing what in the field? Let's go. Let's go. Moving along. Sorry, distinguished sir! It's over, it's over! It's over! Just a minute, we'll be right out. Circulating. What was that? It's not going to happen. What do you mean? But don't you just ask? No... I have to... wish. And the only thing I wish for now is to spend an afternoon with Melina again. You're kidding, right? No, "Cabe?a". Have you ever spent an afternoon with a beautiful beautiful girl you love? A girl who looks at you, who listens to you, who hugs you, who talks to you... Man, that is all about you? I never had that in the other life, but in this one, I can have it. You are a real man, aren't you? Why is that? Because only a guy would do something stupid like that just to get the girl. Oh, shut up! Shut up! - Come on. - Come on! Ju! It's about time. You cooked? For me? You did? Hey! Of course you did! I always cook for us. Thanks! Thank you. Thank you. Hey! Thanks for the tip. What tip? The tip you gave me to get to Adri's. It worked well. Which Adri? Adriana Pinho. From my office. Fuck you, Alexandre! You've already caught Adriana Pinho in the 8th grade. In fact, you took the whole 8th grade. Then you took the seventh grade, the sixth grade. You took the whole street. You are Alexandre Martinez. What year was this? Are you taking me out? I swear I'm not. It's not my fault that I'm an arrested wheel, okay? You didn't grow up with your father saying: "Don't do to anyone what you don't want me to do with your sister." Result: I went kissing for the first time when I was 18. I understand you. What kind of world is this that my brother picks up my plate? It stopped! What was Scarlett Johansson's dress at the Oscars? Guys, I need that slit! No, it was too much! Julia! Julia! - I wanted to talk to you. - Hold on, "Cabe?a". A friend of mine in Italy has already worn that dress - at a wedding. That's true. - Really? Guys. - I'll be right back, okay? - I have a look-alike. There! It stopped, "Cabe?a"! Julia, there's going to be a meteor shower tomorrow! For God's sake! You are burning my film with my friends! - What? - Yeah! The girls think you're funny, okay? Relax, Alicia likes your hair, at least. Oh yeah? And what are you guys doing later? You're going to shave and watch "The Kardashian Sisters", right? The show is good. Kim's ass is huge, even vulgar. But the show is good. Julia, come here. Are you really enjoying the life of a little woman? Look, "Cabe?a"... I am, man! I am. It's fucking great! My brother treats me better, my father too. People smile at me. They open doors, pull out chairs. They invite me to parties, man! You know how it is. I'd say something far-fetched, they look at me with disgust. Now I speak any shit, I speak any nonsense and they think I'm smart! To be a woman, "Cabe?a"... Being a woman... is like... it's like being... an X-Men. And I'm Wolverine. Wolverine has claws and an adamantium skeleton. You only have two breasts and a vagina. Trust me, Little "Cabe?a". I have the advantage! Hey, girls! What is this little colorful cell phone? It's a corny thing, full of sequins! Tsc! I got into character. Yeah, this way, soon, someone will get into you. Fuck you! You know I like women. Ah, Paulo Gustavo too. He turns one every chance he gets. Fuck you. What the... What's up, kid? Are you crazy? You don't hit women. Oh, come on! My... My friend... sweetheart. Wow! Hello? Wolverine? Nobody does that for you, right? Oh, yeah! Thank you. Sorry to interrupt your little phone call here. Sorry, professor! Oh, always you, dear! - Sorry. Do you want to come here and do it for me? No. I'm really sorry, okay? That's good. I don't want to humiliate you? I know my salary isn't that great, but humiliate me for what? Yeah, so, because you say that the central equation there is biquadratic, but it has an x raised to the cube. A biquadratic equation is only with even numbers. This affected the result, right? Which is completely wrong. Shh! Yeah, but it's right here with my book. Excuse me, professor. Your book is from 2012. The 2014 edition, Errata has already corrected it. It is correct, professor. Correcting other people's mistakes is easy. I want to see you do it. Worth a grade? Young man, after that, I've got a hard-on for her. Julia! I have to confess something. You surprised me today, young lady. How did you improve so much? Ah, dom. Well, Miss. I have a proposal for you. You know that intercollegiate mathematics olympiad? Hum-rum. I've won it twice. When? Oh, uh... Sleeping, right? - Dreaming. - Ah... That's my big dream. That will come true. - Really? - I'll sign you up today. I want to. I'm in. Congratulations, see? Alright! Ju, movie at home, today, just the two of us. I'll be there in a minute. Kiss. "Cabe?a"! "Cabe?a"! This life, man, it's per-perfect! I'll even give you a kiss now. Really? Just kidding! Dude... you're a fraud. Tsk! This movie kills me, it kills my life, ends with all my expectations of happiness for the future. With me too. Very strong, isn't it? Will I ever meet a guy like that? With cancer? No, Julia. How horrible! A real love, I don't know. You're kidding, right, Mel? You can choose anyone you want. The whole school wants to get you. Not "get"! I'm talking about... someone who looks at me... and isn't afraid to say what he feels. - You know? - Oh, yeah. Do you give these people a chance? Or do you only care about asshole guys, like... Douglas, for example? Because he's rich, has a car, is older. "Hello?", this is you, isn't it, Julia? Douglas wouldn't have a chance with me, honey. Not even in another incarnation. Yeah, right... What do you mean by that? Never mind. Why don't you change... your pattern? And what is this pattern I have now? Okay, fine. There is no pattern, but they say that every form of love is worth it, right? Why don't you open your guard to another kind of guy? Another kind of people? People? It's time for you to give a chance for those who really love you. And who really loves me, Ju? I don't know. There's always someone, right? Mel... Mel... I... I... wanted to show you what's playing on Telecine! Star Wars. Do you like it? Let's go? Star Wars? Or... Like I Was Before You. Wonderful! It kills me, my life, my whole expectation of happiness in life, forever and ever. I love... I'm going to... get some more popcorn. I'll... be right back. Daddy! What is it, my child? What happened? I have to go to the doctor. Now! Doctor? Yes. So, look, you... My God in Heaven! Hold on, princess! I'm going to... I... - Ah! - Ouch! Fuck! Ouch! What's wrong with me? What do I have, doctor? Menstrual cramps. Is that what it is? But what is it now, Julinha? You've been menstruating since you were ten. "Oh, you never forget your first tampon." I gave it to you, didn't I? No, no, no! No, doctor. This is the worst pain I have ever felt in my life! - There must be a cure for this! - And there is. It's called "menopause". It saves my life. But I already told you, honey. It gets better when you start having sex. Beginning, doctor! What beginning? Come on! You're a virgin! Impossible! How impossible? I just examined you. ?! Closed. Are you sure? You saw me there. Are you sure? But what is this, Julia? How can you not know if you're a virgin or not, my child? No, I do, I know, it's... I traveled here. The whole school is talking, so... I end up doubting myself. But each one is each in her own time, Julinha. I lost my virginity when I was 19, in college. But, since high school, everyone thought I had already had sex with God and the world. But that's it, isn't it? Cute, sassy, body, breasts, what is it? Chicken! The person doesn't have sex with anyone and still gets the reputation of a whore. Ah, then men say that it is us who believe in fairy tales. who believe in fairy tales. Ah! One a day. Okay. Doctor? Closed? ?! Hey! What did the doctor say? Nothing. Dad, let's go, I still want to go to class. Hold on, my child. See you later. But why do you still want to go to school, my child? Dad, why wouldn't I? - Come on, the elevator is here. - Because anything is a reason for you to miss school. You've already skipped school because of allergies. Okay, but I won't miss today. After all, what did the doctor say you have? Colic? You made me miss half a day of work because of colic, Julia? You have no idea what it is. No man has it. Am I laughing or am I crying about it? Julia, my child, you have it every month! Am I laughing or am I crying? I'm laughing, but I'm crying. Here, Dad. I need these math books. "Advanced mathematics"? No, wait! Wait! Wait, wait... Now you've confused me. Dad, there's nothing wrong. Let's go. What do you mean, honey? Until last week, you didn't even know not even the right multiplication table. Because I'm going to participate in the Math Olympiad. Ah! I get it. Is it a kind of "Paralympics"? Good girl. So, did I miss much? No. You're talking about marine ecology, ecosystems, that sort of thing. "Cabe?a"! I've lived it. I've seen this scene! Oh, you had a d?j? vu! That's normal. D?j? vu, everybody has it. I was in this class, in another life. Let me tell you something. Everything in class is the same. No, no. If I'm right, Alicia will ask the stupidest question in the world. Teacher? Is an earthworm an insect? A novelty. She always asks stupid questions. She will be in doubt. No, it's serious, people. Is it or isn't it? It must be boring to be a dork in two different dimensions. in two different dimensions. You guys. you need to get out of the books a little bit, you know? Do you realize how serious this situation is? This is the class where Nelson is going to talk about the field trip! Why don't you take a field trip? - To where? - I'm telling you! It's nearby, in B?zios. There is the virgin beach, people! Which is preserved. Take a weekend and do some research. - Can we do it on Saturday? - Yeah, that's fine with me. Hey! Get the map! The map! Okay, class is over. You don't have to talk like that anymore. Holy crap! There's a meteor shower on Saturday. - It starts at 7:34. - Seven thirty-four. Julia, it's not a coincidence! It's a sign. But the date doesn't match. Julia, in this dimension, you are a woman and my sister is a lesbian. Do you want more difference than that? "Cabe?a", I can make this request anytime, anywhere. You can't be sure of that. You've already done it and it didn't work out. Oh, Julia! This could be the last chance for you to go back to the way you were. Will you risk it? Hello! Hello. I really need to talk to you. - I even brought us some ice cream. - Ju! No can do. I'm in the middle of my private math class. Math class, Mel? I could have helped you, right? Yeah. My dad almost died of a heart attack, when I told him about you helping me, right? He doesn't trust you, ever since that thing... ...with the weed. Oh, man! I don't... Okay, fine. Let it go. Check it out... Melina? I have another class after yours. It won't take long. - Okay? - Okay, Vini. "Vini?" Isn't he gorgeous? Oh, he's kind of... I don't know... He looks like a donkey. He studies at the IME. You don't even know this guy. He's a friend of the family. Mel, he's a fag, that's for sure. He's already asked me out. - Has he? - Shh. He asked me out in the first class. We're in our second class. Oh, Ju! He is amazing. And I'm following your advice, right? To meet different people. You said that. But I wasn't talking about him, was I? Melina? Come on! I have to go. Thank you, my friend! We'll talk, okay? Renata. What's up, Julia? How are you? - Fine. - Is your brother there? No. He went out with my mom. They have therapy today. That's why he missed me. Come here. Gee, but... you don't want to come in and wait, do you? No. I have to go anyway. I mean... I don't know. Suddenly... You're not going to let this ice cream melt, are you? ? Is that it? ? How did we think it would be? ? ? life so simple is good? ? Almost always...? Julia? Huh? What do you talk so much about with my brother? Oh, Renata, we talk about everything, right? We talk about television, series, our favorite movies. - Huh? - Life... about women. Women? You talk to my brother about women? We understand each other. Hum-rum. Julia, the "Cabe?a" is a nail who doesn't understand anything about women. The only person who understands women in this house... is me. Do you understand? Renata, you can help me. Yes, I can. Wait! Help you with what? Renata... I like women. I knew that. But... I like Melina. - Melina. - Ah! Oh, yeah! Sorry. Sorry, I... I thought there was something going on. No! There was, there was. - It was! - It was... it was... I mean, it was... - Did it happen? - Yes. Because you're beautiful... You're beautiful too. It was going on, but it's Melina's! I like Melina. I like Melina a lot. So? Do you think she likes you? I'm sure she does. Melina just can't admit it, you know? It's complicated. How can I win over a girl who only sees me as a friend... friend? Nobody is anybody's conquest. Nobody is a trophy, you know? This is just dumb man stuff. You have to seduce her, it's different. And seducing a girl is almost the same thing as seducing a guy. Because seduction is in the soul. Not in the body. Do you understand? Of course it is a matter of production, aesthetics, like that. It is not the main thing, but it can help. You don't need help with this, do you? No, I do. I need help, I really need it. - I need it. - Need it? Renata, I've never seduced a girl before. Help me. Tsk! What can't I do for love, right? Yeah. Tore the boys head off. Dad, I'm going out with Renata, okay? - Okay, my daughter. - Thanks, Renata! Thanks, Renata! I'm gone! Go with God. Wait a minute. Who is Renata? She's Mr. Eudes' daughter. What do you think? No. - What do you think... - Hi! Okay. Can you help me? - What do you think? - Jesus Christ! I can't... No. This one, look. Here, Renata. This cleavage here, man. It's the best! Great for what? Man! Cool! - It's perfect. - Come on! To get the attention of little idiot boys, macho boy who only wants to look at your breasts. But women don't like it? It's vulgar, Julia. You don't have to. I get it. Hmmm... Fancy. Careta! How horrible! Uhn! Love it! Hated it. No! Please! I loved it! No! Stop. Come here. Come back! Renata, I won't. You don't need that. Yes, you do. Are you going to be hairy forever? Don't worry, everything will be fine. Look how beautiful it will be. - It'll look great. - No, I won't. Stay calm. Everything is going to be fine. Oh, fuck! Oh, fuck! Holy shit! I could easily catch myself. Come on, baby! Me too. What's up, Cinderella? The fat little mouse is here! Go wash that dirty dread, girl! Oh, stall! Let me know how it goes, okay? Congratulations. You let her put her hand in, right? Ah, she's a woman, right? And she's hot. Man, how long are you gonna keep this up, huh? Until Melina is totally into me. Yeah, but there's only one problem with that, right? - What's that? - You're lying, man! Haven't you noticed that you're all wrong about this, haven't you? I'm fighting for my love, "Cabe?a"! No, you idiot! You're only thinking about yourself! Julio! Fuck... Damn, man! You haven't become a cool girl. You've become a spoiled, spoiled brat, who thinks that just because you're hot, you can play with everyone's feelings. Yeah? And who are you to judge me? Who are you to judge any girl? You... sexist! What? Chauvinist! Me? You're a man! I didn't tell you, did I, "Cabe?a"? About my new discovery of this feminine universe. Please tell us. Do you know why that pretty girls don't get guys, like this, like us? No, why? Tell us. Tell me. Because they can choose. It is almost a miracle that a woman likes a man after the age of 15. And the guys our age are almost all like you, pathetic, childish, asshole! Dude... don't look for me anymore in this life, okay? Not even in the other one. What's up, baby? You look beautiful! Hey, Ju, I couldn't believe it when you called me, you know? I was thrilled. - Wow, you know... - Check it out! I only asked you out because I didn't have any company for today. It doesn't mean we're going back, or have any possibility. Show? Show. Just give me a kiss, Ouch! Fuck, Julia! What the fuck is that? Oh my... Oh my eye! Fuck! Fuck! Oh my eye, man! Why did you do that? I told you, don't kiss me! Holy shit! I'll go blind! Yeah, you'll be mute too, right? - Get out of there! Get out of there! - Ouch! It hurts! - Get off! - Stop it. I'm driving that shit. Get down. Holy shit! You're backed up, man! - Give it to me! - Fuck, man! Man... Fuck, man! Fuck! Man, this woman, man! I like the woman and the woman keeps doing this to me, man. Come on, Julia! That's fucked up, man! - Man! Why do you do that? - Shut up, Douglas. Come on, I want my mom. Ouch! Julia, damn it! Stop, man! Hi, guys! Hi, Mel! Hi, Vini! Julia, you... you're here. I am, right, my friend? I'm out, right? I came to party. I'm not dead. You look beautiful! This dress... it's wonderful. Yeah? Imagine that! Super old. I took, like this, the first one I saw in the closet. I looked at it and put it on. Yeah, just take off the tag you forgot. Oh, it's great to see you here, man! Well, do you want to sit with us? - You don't have to... - I already did. They put this here for me. Are you here, honey? Yes, Douglas, but you don't have to stay. So, you guys are back together again? That's right, girlfriend! You keep calling me every day! Hey, you're the one who called me. Shut up! So, Vini, what do you major in again? Computer Engineering. - At the IME. - Unbelievable! A real college, right? I'm in Advertising. Is that so, Douglas? Advertising. Humanities, right? Tell us here: 3 + 5. Eight. Right? I think I want to dance. - Shall we go? - Let's go. - Let's go. - Dance. I'm coming too. Wow! That's what I came here for! Oh, shit! Oh, shit! What's up, buddy? I'm sorry I'm here, okay? It's just that I... I forgot that... I don't have a dick anymore. Julia! Were you in the men's room? Yes, I was. - Do you know why? - Huh? Oh, you know what? What is it, too, to be a man, to be a woman, nowadays? It's all convention. Older stuff! Are you all right? I'm fine. But if you need to talk to someone, I'm here, okay? - We can... - Relax, Vini. I'm fine. You dated a friend of mine, you know? We promised each other that no man would break us up. No guy is worth our friendship. It's worth the sacrifice. It's hard, but it's worth it. What's hard? Huh? It's hard... It's hard, Vin?cius, it's... it's hard to... to resist... this beautiful face you have. You're so hot! What's this bullshit, Vin?cius? Why did you kiss me, man? What? Did I kiss you? Did I kiss you? No, she grabbed me. She's drunk. - She's drunk. - Vini, what the fuck. No! Look, she grabbed me by force. A good grip too. I liked it, - I couldn't stop... - Me? You came and grabbed me! You saw what he did! You have to believe me. You don't have to believe what he's saying. We'll talk later. Oh, no! Wait a minute! Oh, no! Horny, no! Stop it, Mel! Stop it! Stop it! It's for the best. That boy wasn't for you anyway. Do you think I'm an idiot, Julia? Why do you think I'm an idiot? I'm your friend. Are you sure? Are you doubting me? He hit on me! And we have a promise. If you don't remember. - If you think... - Julia! There's something very wrong here. It wasn't the first time, and you know it. All my boyfriends, all of them, all the guys that I... I've liked in my life have had a crush on you. Julia Martinez, the fucker. I think I am officially tired of this. This, of competing for attention with you. I won't compete with you anymore. I don't want to compete with you anymore. And I don't think I can't be your friend anymore, Ju. No... It's not like that. Mel! Oh... I did it all for you. Hi, guys... Today I'm not going to talk about makeup or anything. I just... decided to make this video... to apologize. I'm sorry to someone I love, that I hurt a lot. I saw it once in a movie, you may have seen it too, "The Fault in the Stars," that I don't want to have a million admirers. I want to have just one. Or one. As long as it is deeply. Thanks. Thank you. Julia, my daughter. Sit here for a moment with your father. Dad, if it was about yesterday, I already know. One week detention, okay! I won't argue. Julia. I already know everything. I can explain. You're a lesbian, my child. What? No... No. Don't lie to your father. Admit it. No. No, no... I'm not. Hm! Now I understand why you go back and forth with that fat suitcase. To be near his "little shoe" sister. I understand why you and Melina don't let go. I already suspected... No, Dad. No. You've got it all wrong. The "Cabe?a", he's my best friend. I love Melina, I do, but... Julia... I'm gay. I'm gay. I'm very gay, I'm supergay. Big gay. Come here, my child. Come here. Take a good look at me. I want you to know that you have all my support and all my love. Are you serious? You won't freak out? Jorge. What Jorge? Jorge was a friend I had in high school. Hmmm. It was in gym. Right after P.E. class... Hmmm. ...we were alone. It was all dark, like this. And Jorge came up to us with... with that sweaty body and I... Anyway, my daughter, I couldn't... Stop, stop, I've already understood. I don't want to hear what you're going to say. - I want to "unhear" it. - What's that, my child? What do you mean, "unheard"? You mean that you can have your love modern, gay love, and your father can't? I want you to know that I loved Jorge! Did you, Dad? And I loved deeply. Oh, my father... If I accept you better today... it's because Jorge taught me... that love... is much greater than sex. Love is from the heart. I never thought I would hear you say... a thing like that, Dad. But I'm sorry. It's just that it's... it's very new to me. But I found it very beautiful what you said. Come here, Jujube. Give me a hug. Hello! Just a moment, Marcelo. For our jury to check. Okay? Okay! Congratulations! Kidding! Let's hear it for him! He is a genius, this boy! Ok! If you want to take pictures, go a"Cabe?a"... Is it a Navier-Stokes equation? Is it a Navier-Stokes equation? Great, man. Congratulations! Julia, it's your turn. And your challenge is... this one. But this one is very simple. Hmmm... you watch! Well, it's a lottery, isn't it? Professor, I don't think it's right. I want to switch. Julinha, you got lucky. Relax. That's my girl! Champion! You made it easy for me. - You made it easy! - What's that, Julia? Professor, Marcelo Yamazaki is the best. Yeah, but you were great too, my daughter. So what? Is that fair? Julita, let me explain how things work here. The school needs a charismatic charismatic winner! Huh? To put on the billboard, in the school magazine, in the local newspaper! An interesting person, beautiful, "tcham". Now, is there anything more uninteresting than Japanese winning the Mathematics Olympiad again? It will be good for everybody, Julinha! Please! Help the school out! Also, why do you care about him? I care because he must have studied his whole life. He must have spent hours in his room, locked up, giving up parties, trips, girlfriend. Devoting himself to the only thing he does well in life. This is cruel. Julinha, wake up! The world is cruel. Only if we want it to be. Hi, Marcelo! What's up, man? You're really good. You're the best, okay? I'm leaving. Go out there and kick some ass. That's my champion boy! Give him a round of applause! What do you know, huh? Congratulations! Hey, Julia! Julia, wait! What's up, "Cabe?a"? Have you come to talk to the slut from school? No! Sorry, I... I misjudged you. I'm glad you came to talk to me, man! I'm sorry too. - Titty... - Oh! I forgot. Are you going to Buzios the day after tomorrow? Yeah, right? I don't have anything to keep me here anymore. Julia. Who's that over there? Your mother, huh? My mother died... I haven't seen my mother since I was seven. Only in this life she's alive, she just separated from your father. Mom... What's up, young lady? Mom... Why don't we live together? Hey, Julia, what kind of question is that? Because you didn't want to, you know! You and your brother chose to live with your father, and I... I respected that decision. But that can change, can't it? Julia, what's going on? We never got along well. The last time we talked, you sent me to hell. Do you remember? Forgive me, mom. I'm sorry. Bye, Dad. Professor, I'm sorry I'm late. No. You're not late. It's okay. You're sweet here! Is that okay? I know... I'm not having a good day today. Hi, Henrique! We never really got along. The last time we talked, you sent me to hell. Hey, Julia, are you okay? No. No. - I'm coming down. - Get down! I can't get down. - I have to get down. - But you can't. Julia? What's wrong? I had to see you, Mom! You didn't have an excursion... Daughter, why so anxious? What's going on? Mom... Have you... have you ever had to... give up something you love very much, to have something else? All the time, daughter. That's what living is. It means giving up a lot of things. Even the ones you love? Who do you love? I love you. I love my father, my brother, the "Cabe?a", my friends... Melina. I love my life, Mom. Julia, don't you think that you are missing someone very important on your list? - Who is it? - You. Julia, in order to really love, we have to be honest with ourselves. Since we can't have everything, we have to learn to let go of the right things. So you give up everything in your life, except yourself. Mom... I miss... I miss you so much! Can I stay here? And then you can take me to Buzios? Please? - Please! - Of course. Of course! Thanks, Mom! Thank you, Mom! For what? For the ride. For the afternoon, for the conversation. For everything I am in life and for everything I have. Why are you saying this? Nothing, Mom. We never know when when you'll be able to say it again, right? See you Monday? Sure. Julia, you're late! Where are you, man? I'm asking, man. Where are you? I'm here, there's no one here. I don't even recognize this place. Praia das Virgens is divided in two parts, by the rocks, you must have stopped at the first one. Julia, you won't make it in time! It's too far away. Shit! "Cabe?a"! "Cabe?a"! Ah! I knew you wouldn't give up! What? What time is it? There's ten minutes left, you have to go. Hold on! Hold it right there! Stay here with my watch. You know I won't give it back to you, right? I'll lose my only friend. That's the least of it. You know what it is, "Cabe?a"? - Huh? - It's that no guy in the world does like you do... that! With that hot face you have! Hm! Yummy! Hum... - Guys... - Irado! Ouch! Why did you do that? For our friendship. I've come back here for a while, but... these girls will look at you differently. Thanks! Not at all. You'd do the same for me. Amen! Force of habit, my little "Cabe?a"! Bye, "Cabe?a"! Holy crap! Five minutes! Go, go, go! I'm going! I'm coming! Julia! Mel, please, get out of here! The "Cabe?a" told me everything. The "Cabe?a" told me everything. Anything the "Cabe?a" might have said... Julia! I know you love me. And I wanted to say... that I love you too. No. No, no. Don't do this! Look at me! I'm sorry if it took me a while to realize it, but... you're my best friend, my... best partner, and everything I've ever wanted in someone. And I try to imagine the world without us, but... that world wouldn't make sense. That's from The Fault in the Stars. Yeah. But that's how I feel. Let's stay together, Ju. Mel, I... I'm not who you think I am. And who is what you think? I want to love who I am and fight for what I love always. Always. Always. Speak up, oh, four eyes! Whose sandwich is that? For you. Mine? But you never do anything for me. I think that's our problem, Alexandre. We have to do more for each other. Be more of a friend, more of a partner, you know? A real brother. What do you want, huh? Nothing. Maybe some tips on how to get girls. If you can help me. Make another one of these and I'll help you. Nice weather, huh, dude? - Hey, sonny! - Hi, Dad! Look who I ran into today at the gym. My friend Jorge! Talk to me, neguinho. Your oldest? No, this is my youngest. Son, can you believe we went to high school together? We have been friends since we were kids! Your father and I were like that, we were tight. - No, but I was the top finger. - No, wait! Stop it. - Mine was the top finger. - Not always, right? - You can stop. - Stop, Jorge! Neguinho! I miss you, Gilberto! How I miss you! How I miss you! It's good to see you, baby! Good to see you! - What's up, man? - Come here, Dad. What is it? I'm glad you're happy, Dad. That's what matters. Oh! My boy! My boy! That's my boy! Come on, Julio! Do you want to eat something? - Hey, do you like a sandwich? No, I'm on a diet. Do you have turkey breast there? There's turkey breast, there's everything here. Stop making it up, man! What? I'm not making it up, that's what happened. Whether I dreamt it, or it was my allergy medicine, I don't know, but it was this, believe me. Then tell me something here: in this other dimension, was I a virgin too? Man, you are a virgin in any dimension. Only because of your acid trip there, now you think you understand everything about women, don't you? More than you do, that's for sure. Man, I was a woman. I menstruated! I had a pussy, you won't believe me? Holy shit! What's wrong? Liamara went back to school, man! She must have finished her exchange program. Guys, she's pretty, isn't she? ?! Does she remember me? She does. She's coming here, what do I say? What do I say? Oh, my God! Dude, go there, talk to her. If it's really you, she'll like you. - Yeah? - You're a nice person. Fix your hair here. Go a"Cabe?a". Psst! Important thing: no matter what, don't ask me to hold her titty. - You don't? - Shh! Go on. Hi, "Cabe?a"! Remember me? ?! Do I? I... I think about you every day! So do I. I think about you every day. - Really? - Hum-rum. - Want to have a soda? - Let's go! Let's go? I'll have one too. Can I take your... hand? Of course you can! Come on. What's up? How are things? You? They called me from here, man! Private math tutor? I can do it at home, if your boyfriend doesn't mind. I just broke up with Douglas. Even better! I called two other candidates, okay? Forget it! I am the best. I've won two Mathematics Olympiads, I'm fast, good, cheap and I teach first class at Juju's ice cream parlor. I love Juju!

Yes, but she gave me the address. - That's the address. - Get lost! Sorry, you're... I'm your worst nightmare if you don't get out of here now! - Shall we go? - Let's go. I think it's super-valid too a little ice cream war. Come here, how did you know that I loved Juju? Who doesn't? It is the best ice cream in Rio de Janeiro. I think it is second only to Frozen from Leblon, - which is also delicious. - Love it too! And they give that spoon as a freebie. You know it's not a freebie, right? You are stealing a spoon. - Really? Yeah. Ouch, ouch! Oh! Do you know what's on TV today? What's on tonight? "The Fault in Our Stars". Do you like it? No, but I'll watch it with you if you want. You're crazy. Look.., life is what it is, right? Come here, if you woke up in a man's body, what would be the first thing you would do? - Hypothetically? - It's the story of a book I'm reading. It's a boy, and he loved his mother very much, - and his mother loved him very much. - Huh? And one day he had to do a science project. - To build a Solar system... - Hum-rum. ...with little Styrofoam balls and everything, and nobody had bought any material. He went out, with his mother, to get this material. She went... And that's all I read. Oh, really? But I heard that there is going to be a series, right? Is it? I think it's interesting.
