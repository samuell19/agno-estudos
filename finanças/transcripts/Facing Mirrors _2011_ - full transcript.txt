You had an accident. Don't you remember? The driver of the other car brought you here Poor man. He was truly scared He was worried sick until he was sure you'd be okay I think he's still trembling out of fear Your friend was with him What a friend If not for her, the driver would have been arrested She paid the hospital bill, and left a letter for you in the drawer How long do I have to stay? Until they bring in the clean sheets I'm kidding You're fine I think you can leave tomorrow Now, rest until I return Will it take long? Not you too The madame who brought it in has pushed me for the past two days to finish it She knows how hard we are working on it Where is the madame you're talking about? In the backyard, near the sheepcote Hi Rana Are you fine? Weren't you scared of getting caught? What would you have done, if you had been in my shoes When I took you to the hospital, I found that I was scared in vain My dad, the guy who wanted to wring my neck... had not informed the police out of honor You mean they're not looking for you anymore? They are, but not through the police They are probably on their way now How do you know these things? I have my own spies I'm my father's child, after all I'm thankful to you Here, take this It's yours Why? We had a deal. Have you forgotten? No, but I didn't take you there If you had, my father would have dragged me to Tehran, forcing me to get married It was worth more than taking me What do you want to do now? I don't know about myself. But I'll drive you home when your car is fixed No thank you. I can drive myself It's not right to drive in your condition I'm fine. I can do it. I'm better off All right, as you wish I'll go check the car Adineh Forgive me Why? Because you slapped me? Or because you don't want me to drive you? Don't be shy Say that you don't want me to drive you because– Don't say anything, for God's sake Please don't. I didn't say anything, either You didn't? Rana, what did that slap mean? Or why did you have an accident? Wasn't it because you wanted to get away from me as fast as you could? Wasn't it? I slapped you because I was shocked... because I didn't know what to do I thought a man had deceived me, and gotten into my car You idiot I haven't had the operation yet Don't you see my father is forcing me to take a husband? How could I think about these things at the moment? I have never seen anyone of this type before How could I know? Call Akram, she's worried about you She called when you were unconscious She wanted to say, your mother-in-law has gone to Tabriz herself Your sister-in-law is in labor She had tried to call you at your work, but you weren't there She wanted to take your son... but Akram didn't let her, and stayed with him herself Rana, don't worry She told your mother-in-law that you were hit by a cyclist, and were taken to hospital And your appearance will help to prove it I'm so ashamed Are you still willing to drive me to Tehran? As long as I remember, I was never like other girls Even though there were many girls in our family, I only played with Emad and my cousin, Babak We were a team of three, and no one could be a match for us... neither in fights, nor in games But since I was a kid, I loved two things: to become a bride, and to drive myself And Sadegh gave me both You should have seen the faces of the people around us when I drove for the first time My mother-in-law said: women should not drive when men are around But Sadegh said: it's good for a rainy day No one knew that the rainy day would come like this I was five when I lost my mother... and had no female in my world anymore When I reached puberty, my father became more sensitive Kept asking: "What's wrong with you? Why don't you have any female friends? Why don't you wear skirts? Why don't you behave like a woman? Why do you act like a thug? You are embarrassing me" But I didn't understand what he meant The male who lived inside me grew stronger by the day Sometimes I was even scared of him myself Everything was fine till last year Not that we didn't have any problems. We did But we were also happy until the night when Sadegh said that he wants to open a sports shop with a friend A heavy loan from the bank, and borrowed money, enabled them to set up their business At first, everything was fine. In fact, we thought it was... not knowing that his partner was not repaying the bank payments, and... had bought a piece of land for his wife with the money He disappeared later Sadegh was left with empty hands, and the lenders who had warrants for his arrest The shop was auctioned off by the bank When I was in Germany, my aunt took me to a psychiatrist To be honest, at first I was shy to talk about my problem. But I finally said it to him He sent me to another doctor to do some tests After that, they found out I was really a TS, and not an illusionist Last year I finally made up my mind I had just started the hormone therapy when Emad called... and said my father was ill, and I had to return as soon as possible When I got back I realized that I was taken in My dad was not sick He had fabricated it all to stop the operation and force me to take a husband Poor Marjan and Babak They had a secret plan to get married... and intended to inform their families after Moharram - Thanks - You're welcome Do you have anywhere to stay? I'll find somewhere It's late now Stay tonight, if you like Leave in the morning Are you sure? What the hell are you doing here? Who are you? Get over here, thug. What are you doing here? - Let me explain, ma'am - Explain what? Rana, call 110 What are you doing? Call 110. He is a thief Akram, let go of her. What thief? Let me talk Are you okay? Get out How could I know she's a girl? What a mistake Why was she shaving, then? Does a woman shave her face? Where are you going? I'm talking to you I know you're hurt. It was my fault to not tell Akram about you last night Don't leave like this, for God's sake What have I done to you, my daughter? How could I have known you are a girl? Forgive me I meant no harm, my daughter Forgive me, please Don't cry, dear Let me see your face Sit here, dear. I'll bring you some hot tea - Would you like some tea, too? - No, sit down. I'll pour it myself - I don't want any - Why? I have to go Clean your face, dear Rana told me what you have done for her God bless you People like you are hard to find nowadays You'd put a man to shame I don't know what would have happened to her if you weren't there If I weren't there, nothing would have happened to her But you scared me to death My dear girl shaves Your skin gets rough. I could have threaded your face Have you forgiven me? I should go Are you going to work? No, it's closed today. I'm going home. The plumber is supposed to come today - Goodbye -Take care Have you told her? Of course not How could I? How can I tell people that you are neither a man nor a woman What do you think yourself? Me? I think, God forbid, you're fighting divine will... and it's a sin Sin? Yes It's a sin God wont like it You've been born a woman... and you should stay as one Like me Like your late mother Like Marjan Look, I might help you... but I don't understand you at all You don't understand because you have never been in my shoes You think that I slept one night and when I woke up I decided to become a man? Yes? You're unfair I had no choice of being in limbo, as you had no say in being a woman The only difference is that you are not confused You're not stigmatized But I am Hi - Hello, my dearest - What's wrong with your neck Nothing, my love. Oh, I've missed you so much Who is this? A friend, my son I'm Eddie Why is your handshake so weak? A man's handshake should be strong - Bravo - Your cap is cool Yeah? Your own cap is cool Thanks uncle No, not uncle. Aunt Whoever is bald, is not uncle Go wash up and come for breakfast Whoever is bald, is not uncle Go wash up and come for breakfast Uncle? Aunt? Do you want to leave? Yeah. I better leave before Ali is more confused about uncles and aunts Don't worry, I wont take you with me this time Where do you want to go? No idea yet Do you want to stay here until your passport is ready? Here? Do you know what you want to do? Isn't your family convinced that you have fled Tehran? So Tehran would be the last place for them to look for you Harder It wasn't a goal. Why don't you score a goal? Come on kick the ball like a man. Run I've scored a goal What happened? Ali? What happened? What a deep cut I think we'll have to cut out your hand and replace it with a big fork Who's there? I'll open the door Yes? Excuse me, sir. Is Ms Rana in? Hello Mr Mozaffar How are you? How's Ms Fahimeh? She says hello. How's Mr Sadegh? Any news? He's fine. He says hello I was here two days ago for the settlement of bills You weren't home. Your mother-in-law wasn't in either Yes. She's gone to Tabriz for a few days Just a minute. I'll take care of it Ali dear, go bring my purse Wait. I have money on me. How much is it? 5 plus 12. 67,000 tomans There you go Don't you have change? Change is more useful for me and my customers You don't seem to be from this neighborhood Keep the rest for the next bills He's my brother. He's come from out of town I see With your permission Did your brother make a mess, sis? Hi What the hell Why have you dressed up like this? Are you not ashamed? What is this look? Oh God. Go inside I don't want to see you like this ever again. Understood? If your father finds out, he'll never talk to you again My dear Ali I yelled at you because I was tired I know Don't cry. Okay. My love Look at me. Didn't you promise your dad to be my man? - I did - Men never cry My sweet heart. My dear It was auntie's fault Let's play Act like a duck My baby - Eddie, dear - Marjan? - Hi - Any news? Yes Can I come in? Something wrong? Why did you upset your child over me? I never thought mothers could be cruel Don't worry He wont turn into someone like me Your bedroom is just as I imagined Do you wear men's cologne, or is this Sadegh's? You're madly in love with him, aren't you? What is it like to be in love? Have you ever been in love? Sadegh believes being in love should be in your destiny Suddenly you see a person who is different from others You know his footstep You know his scent When you see him, your heart beats so fast that you think everyone else can hear it You feel sick if he ignores you You feel good when he is there When he is not... It doesn't matter whether you are on speaking terms or not All that matters is his being there, by your side No one else can replace him Actually, he becomes everything to you You'll completely forget yourself Has he ever annoyed you? Have you ever regretted marrying him? Annoyed, yes Regretted, no Do you think if you were in his place, he would have waited for you? I have no doubt How long are you willing to wait for him? As long as is necessary How much is his debt? 18 million tomans You need to work more than 20 years to be able to come up with this money God is great Would you believe me if I said... I wish I were in your shoes I'm serious I wish I could be in love with someone, and I could talk about it... with no fear of being hated, damned, or causing embarrassment I wish I could stay here... in my own country... and live with my love Even if there is prison between us But now I can't even count on my father and brother's love If you are not forced to leave, you'll never appreciate your homeland Why don't you stay? Can't you have the operation here? I can. It has been legal here for sometime now. We can even get a loan from it Iran is one of the few places where it is medically treated But the problem is not the operation It's the life after it Especially with a family like mine You know? I wish my mother were alive It might have been different She would have understood me better than my dad Are you sure your life will be better after the operation? No. I'm not But I can't go on like this anymore either Mom Where are you? Rana, pray for me... in the same way you pray for the freedom of Sadegh Didn't you go to work? I did. I told them you had an accident and need help I came to take Ali, so that you can go visit Sadegh Thanks, but Eddie will look after him. Sorry, I forgot to tell you In fact, you forgot to tell me that she's staying here Look Rana, you know that I want the best for you You're naive. You have a big heart She may deceive you Deceive me? What for, Akram? To steal my money or take my husband? I told you before I owe her Yes? It's Marjan, Eddie's friend. Sorry for bothering you I can't reach Eddie on her mobile. I think she doesn't recognize my new number Would you like to talk to her? You're welcome. Tell me Goodbye You're putting yourself in trouble What trouble, Akram? I saw Fahimeh. She said that Mozaffar has seen a young lad here I said: That is not a boy. She's a girl. A relative of Rana's husband She said: No. Rana has said herself that he is her brother Why did you say she is your brother? It was shock, Akram I thought I'd better say that she's my brother because of her appearance Nothing better came to my mind Have you ever asked her why she shaves? How are you Ms Akram? Fine, thanks God Is something wrong? Call Marjan. I've written down her new number At least tell her not to answer the door like this You want to live in this neighborhood When your mother-in-law returns, you'll have to answer the questions Something's happened which we didn't think of What? The postman told my dad that he will only give the passport to you or to your next of kin He said that you could go to the post office to collect your passport You are really useless, Marjan I swear to God Eddie, I wasn't home. Otherwise– I'm here to collect my passport Your ID's Please sign here Ma'am, your card Taxi I said I'd wring your neck this time. Let go of me - Let go of me - Dad I said you shouldn't trust her Something must have happened to her Stop making that noise It's okay, dear My sweetheart I'm taking Ali with me Will you go with auntie? - His jacket is on the hanger - Alright - Ms Marjan? - Yes Hi. This is Rana I'm worried about Adineh. I just wanted to know if you have any news? She said she'd be back soon, but she hasn't returned yet She's not answering her phone, either She's at her dad's What? My father told her dad about the passport I didn't know. They caught her at the post office She'll get married tomorrow Can you please give me her home address? Yes? Is this the Tolouee's house? Yes. Who are you? I'm Eddie's friend. I wanted to talk to you Mr Tolouee? -You must be Mr Emad - Yes. And you? - Can I talk to your father? - What about? - Hello - What do you want to talk about? About Eddie I don't know anyone by this name. You're at the wrong place Allow me. I mean Adineh Emad, show this madame out I won't leave before I say what I came here for It's better for you to leave before I call the police Police? Why the police? Aren't you the one who hidAdineh? I don't know much about law, maybe you can do so It's not important But allow me to talk first Emad, what are you waiting for? Show her out Now I realize why you never understood her You only talk, and never listen Our family matters have got nothing to do with you Are you her girlfriend? Emad, throw her out Watch your mouth, sir If my husband were here, he would get back at you - What the hell have you done? - Dad? Shut up and call 110 if you don't have the guts Mr Tolouee, insulting me and handing me over to the police will not solve your child's problem Forcing her to get married won't help either Who are you to talk to me like this? I'm nobody. But I understand that... You mean, you know better what's best for my daughter? No. I only have a deep sympathy for her I'm sure you are not truly happy either about the way you treat her Bravo, bravo How come you are so sure? Are you a psychiatrist or a fortune teller? No, I'm not But I have a child myself I know that no parent can bare to see their children in pain She doesn't have a mother to feel for her But you, as her father, should support her... not try to get rid of her, and push her into a bigger problem - You are advising me? - Who am I to give advice? Yeah. I do give advice Who said that only elders can give advice? I have only known your daughter for a few days... but enough to believe that she is not crazy or a pervert She doesn't want to annoy or embarrass you She just can't be like others It's not her choice Whether she's a girl or a boy, she's human... and a good one I'm sure God loves her, and has more mercy on her Eddie, Adineh, whatever you like, is suffering If you lover her, stop hurting her If everyone rejects her, you don't Help her if you lover her You'll have to explain to her mother on the other side Mr Tolouee. I beg you Please Why do you insist on helping her? When I was coming here, I thought I wanted to help her because I owe her... but now I'm sure I want to help her because she's so lonely... because she's my friend May I ask you something? If someday you realize your child has the same problem, what would you do? It may break me hard, but I will certainly help him. I'm sure These kinds of children are much lonelier than others Now may I ask you something? If your father forces you to take a husband, what would you do? Is she gone? Don't open the door if she returns It's not necessary to say anything to your sister. She'll relapse Dad, do you realize what you are doing? Yes. I'm being a parent. I know what's best for my child better than anyone else Better. Best. What about love, dad? Do you lover her at all? Take a seat How can you be so unfair? I don't love her? How can a man not love his child? Eddie and I have always respected you, dad Yeah. Let me call her Eddie, as she likes to be called I decided to talk to you about her so many times, but I was always scared You never knew how confused I became when I found out about her problem Do you have any idea how worried Eddie is? We never allowed ourselves to say anything against your word Dad, you must accept that the fact wont change through your denial Your sister's issue is not a fact It's an illusion I'm sure that if her mother hadn't died so soon, If Adineh had been brought up by her mother... This wouldn't have happened She would be living her life like other women, and would be raising her children Yeah... It's my fault It's my fault for not realizing what was happening to my child on time I missed it But I wont let her gamble her life and her honor... our honor... to turn into a wanderer living abroad May God forbid me I wish she was deaf, blind, crippled... but not stigmatized and notorious You missed one wish That she were dead, and wouldn't disgrace you in front of others Those who wouldn't even trade the hair of their children for both of yours My daughter... your sister... will get married tomorrow She must wear a wedding dress like other girls, and keep the family's tongues from wagging She must either live like others, or she should think that I'm dead like her mother... then she can do any damn thing that she wants You both better understand it Okay, here is the hair, tiara and veil Look how much prettier you are with hair I don't know why you shave your head, girl Yeah Okay Hold on a second - When is she done? - Soon Get it over with. Don't put so much make-up on her My sister is on her way to the notary She's almost ready. I'll prepare things until you arrive Okay, bye I'm going to the notary. Bring her as soon as she's ready This time he hadn't torn it up Don't ask why, because I don't know either Maybe deep down inside he's not happy about what he's doing I don't know if I'm doing the right thing or not May God help me if I'm mistaken Your friend is waiting for you. Go She's a good friend. Appreciate her You may get into trouble I don't know Just leave before I regret it Take care of yourself Wipe that shit of your face You look really ugly Mr Emad, she left today. Pray for her Eddie Tolouee? - Yes - The doctor is expecting you - Do you want to sell these? - Yes One moment Are you Iranian? I guessed you might be Iranian, because the jewelry is Iranian We are Iranians, too May I ask where you got these from? They belonged to my late mother And you want to sell them. Alright, I'll have a look Dear Rana, you must accept my gift This was the least that I could do for you Not easy? Then accept it as a loan Just accept it By the way, the doctor have started the hormone therapy I'll have the operation in three months. I'll let you know the time, then you can pray for me Be happy. Deeply. With Ali and Sadegh They are so lucky to have you All of us are Maybe somedays, somewhere, we see each other again This time as your son's uncle, Eddie Pray for me, just like you pray for Ali... like a mother You can't imagine how happy I am that you are here Never, ever leave me again, okay? Are you asleep? No Are you still angry with me? Shouldn't I be? But I explained everything to you May I pour you a tea? With sugar... in a tulip-shaped glass, cardamom flavored? I swear, this time it smells of cardamom Sadegh?
