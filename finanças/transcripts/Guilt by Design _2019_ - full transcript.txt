15 years ago a serial killer was here for psychological assessment His crime was robbing a cop's gun, injuring two cops, and restraining a psychologist Goddamn cops, they're all useless You're also useless You all listen to me I have a gun I want a car, get me a car Has the negotiator arrived? He's almost here - You move and I'll kill you - Calm down I'm here to help you Look at me I'm done, he's all yours Don't move, don't shoot Put the gun down - Put the gun down, - Put your hands behind your head I'm telling you, gun down I really want to know just what happened in there The look on that guy's face... I'll never forget it Back then he was known as Dr. Xu Lisheng, the most powerful hypnotist alive Now he's a juror in this case Every cop alive knows what he can do But 10 years ago his wife got depressed after giving birth and overdosed on sleeping pills Since then he's stopped practicing hypnosis With him on the jury we've really lucked out "Master hypnotist, Xu Lisheng" "Doctor Xu World-Reknowned Hypnotist Exclusive Interview (2008)" You've upended our traditional understanding of hypnosis Dr. Ky, can you really hypnotize someone without them noticing? Yes What if I'm skeptical, can you still hypnotize me? I've been staring at your glass, you just took a sip Did you actually drink it? Are you sure I didn't hypnotize you to do it? Did you really hypnotize me? Just kidding, that was a joke But whether someone's skeptical or not If you find their key point, you can hypnotize them Hypnosis is a complex art demanding constant study So, what do you mean by "key point"? It's a "hot button” that triggers a hypnotic state Some people react to a color, sound or word Others react to a certain tune, or object Everyone is different Dr. Xu, as the world's top hypnosis expert Surely you've considered using hypnosis to satisfy your own desires? Never, I absolutely would not Why? I study hypnosis to help others Not to control them And also: we should never be hypnotized by desire - Good morning Professor Xu - Good morning You dyed your hair blonde again All your body's strength will flow from the top of your head to your chest, thighs, calves, and out from your feet Relax Take a deep breath When I count to three Everyone will fall asleep One Two Three What happened? Why was it turned off, Professor? We haven't finished watching it Is this kindergarten? You all keep watching that old video Don't you get bored? This class is on Personal Psychology not Hypnosis C'mon, Professor, teach us about hypnosis! Alright then So, do you understand the essence of hypnosis? It is care, caring for others It was originally used to treat emotional disorders and mental illness If you think hypnosis is just a trick you can use to manipulate others, I need to exercise extreme caution But Professor, you're not a very cautious person Actually, I'm more cautious than when I grade your papers Stop joking now Show us, Professor Yeah, show us Ok, then Now, I want to ask everyone to not picture a green elephant Do NOT picture a green elephant This classmate here: What are you thinking about right now? A green elephant I wasn't picturing the color green ... Then please write down the color you pictured Don't let anyone see it Let's all guess what color he'd pictured Ah, it's hard to guess C'mon, just give us some hints Judging by what I see, what he pictured was the color pink Please show everyone the answer "Pink" Guessing the color you'd pictured was actually quite easy If everyone is truly enjoying this we can continue with this lesson But only if you're genuinely enjoying it... because I really didn't hypnotize you Ok then, let's begin... The sensational trial of the murder on the Lin family yacht officially opened today Defendant Lin Ziying is suspected of murdering her uncle Lin Jiawei, Chairman of the Lin Group The Defendant is the largest heir to the Lin family fortune It appears this involves a fight among heirs The entire Lin family has shown up for the hearing Stepping out of his car is the family's senior elder, the uncle of the deceased, Lin Guoquan Beside him is his son, Lin Baiming Although there were no witnesses, the authorities have nonetheless decided to prosecute Lin Ziying Lin Guoquan, who's now acting Chairman of the Group, has expressed his support for this decision This highly controversial case will, per standard judicial procedure, be submitted to a 7-person jury for a ruling Defendant Lin Ziying is hereby summoned May I ask the Defendant Are you the person in this photograph? Yes These photos were taken after the deceased knocked me out He threatened me He'd demanded I meet him on the yacht alone that night He wanted me to give up my late father's 18% shareholdings in Lin Group He didn't want me to receive the inheritance and become the Group's largest shareholder I tried to grab the photos back right away, but he hit me with an ashtray and knocked me out You say the deceased knocked you out But how do you explain the fact that your hands were stained with his blood, and the fruit knife also bore your fingerprints? This recording is the verbal confession the Defendant made at the scene You personally acknowledged at the time that you used the fruit knife to stab the deceased Is that correct? On the day of the crime, was it you who recorded the Defendant's verbal confession? Yes May I ask, did you, in accordance with the rules and procedures for verbal confessions, read my client her rights? Your Honor This is the recording of my client's verbal confession that was made by Detective Lu Peirong According to Police Department procedures, detectives must read suspects their rights But from this recording we can confirm that Detective Lu failed to do this I hope Your Honor will listen to the recording marked as Exhibit D018 and then rule that the confession recorded by Lu Peirong is invalid Quiet in the court! I hereby declare that the Defendant's confession recorded by Detective Lu is inadmissible The jury should ignore it Hello Brother-in-law, did you get hot and sour soup? I sure did... How did Yinyin do in her race? - Yinyin - Dad, didn't you say you'd be back? Yes, I'm here, I'm here He's here? Good, he's home Beautiful girl, stop your pouting Look, Auntie made you a tableful of good food Give me a smile! I'm home! What's wrong? Did you lose? But you've still made the finals, right?

Yeah, lots to do tomorrow Ok then Oh The race finals are on the 29th The 29th... I have to be in court So you'll miss it again? That's the last court hearing Uncle Don't worry I'll take a day off to cheer you on It's late, how come you're still up? Listening secretly to music... Let me have a look... Another gift from Uncle? He's really spoiling you Uncle says this watch will be helpful for my training Take a look, it also has a GPS You can find me anytime, it's so convenient Yeah, and most convenient is it keeps you up all night secretly listening to music What song are you listening to? If you listen to this stuff how can you fall asleep? Hurry, get to sleep Classical music again, so boring According to statistical evidence 113 of the time, when making important decisions, people are affected by music. That's also to say, so long as you have a need, if you choose the right music it will certainly be of use to you The bracelet's color is fading Makes sense, it's been almost a year Ok then, I'll make another to give you on Father's Day You hurry up and get to sleep Otherwise I'll bite your butt Get to sleep Good night My headaches have stopped, your method really works If you stick with my method It should give you good results But if you want I can find you a hypnotherapist If it's someone else, never mind If he doesn't do it right, I'll get hypnotized and he'll cheat me out a few billion, then what'll I do? Next week's the 25th anniversary party, you going? Yup I've been told I'm getting the Top Alumnus Award I need to warn you Don't make a fool of yourself again by flying your helicopter there Don't be so flashy Good morning Boss Good morning Boss Amy I think you look better in stockings Okay You're so vulgar How have I been friends with you for so long? How could you not? I'm just so charming By the way, how'd my goddaughter do in her race? She's into the finals but still a bit nervous Trust me, she'll be fine She's so good, she'll definitely win, and we can go celebrate at my restaurant Let's see what happens... I'm heading out I'll see you out No need, you take a break now, 'bye Bye The boss will come down later You'll take care of the driving Then have two colleagues go ahead to the restaurant to prepare Hotpot - Understood? - Understood You can't keep thinking about that old injury Thank you, Captain Yang, for making a special trip What for? I'm serious Have you thought about what I said to you last time ? If you decide to come, our boss will certainly welcome you I'll think it over What's to think about? Old Zhou's coming Which Old Zhou are you talking about? Our former army unit's Old Zhou, remember him? Why not come? Old comrades all together, it'd be great Before my sister died she wanted me to look after Yinyin Do you still remember? You're 30 years old You need to think about your future Boss has come down Thank you - Go then, - bye 8 billion Now that Lin Jiawei's dead, no one can prevent the Defendant from inheriting 8 billion and becoming Lin Group's new Chairman That night the Defendant was the only one who had contact with the deceased on the yacht And also, the knife bears the Defendant's fingerprints and the blood of the deceased This shows that this 19-year old we see before us, this seemingly pitiful Defendant is actually a vicious criminal who wouldn't even spare her own uncle A Killer That is why we should find Defendant Lin Ziying guilty of murder The prosecutor says that my client murdered a person for 8 billion This is ridiculous, because my client is the legal heir to the inheritance to begin with She was threatened with nude photos by the deceased and even suffered a wound It's she who is the victim There are no witnesses for this case All the accusations are questionable I hope that each member of the jury will listen to your conscience and find my client not guilty Members of the jury you may leave now to begin your deliberations You'll be completely sequestered until there is a verdict Serving as a juror is a sacred duty I ask that everyone makes for this case a fair and just ruling With him on the jury we've really lucked out How can you ensue that he'll help us? If you get him to do this, I'll give you a billion I'm leaving now Father How dare you do this? All it was was killing one person Did you have to do it yourself? You really disappoint me But Father Manipulating the jury is very serious Then do you want to turn yourself in? This case may not end up ruining Lin Ziying What would you do then? But, I'm worried You didn't seem worried when you killed him "Lin Ziying will be sentenced today" "The Defense: She'll likely be acquitted and released" "Lin Group's stock continues to fall, the final verdict may be the key" Hello? Yes Dear, Yes, buy 4 million She'll definitely be acquitted The stock will triple when the news come out Just listen to me, buy it now Professor Xu X Here are the books you lent me Finished? So fast I must admit that I missed them though Now you can stop missing them I agree more with Freud We can talk more about this next time Great, after the case is over See you around Mr. Liang Professor Your daugther? Yes She won a track race today My daughter just got into college Her grades are good, but not her health I've been a social worker for so many years Now I know why they say peace is a blessing A happy family is the most precious thing True, we all need to be happy This is the cartoon I watched yesterday The dinosaur roared and roared... Doudou, have you seen Xu Zhongyin? She went to the changing room Contestants for the 4 x 100 relay Please come sign in Yinyin, are you in there? Excuse me Sure Hello Professor Xu Yes, who am I speaking to? I have your daughter If you want her to be safe you must follow my orders Why should I believe you? Now everyone, let's get into the chamber Hand over your phones, please No rush You can enter now, - no magazines, please - Remember, if you call the cops I'll kill her Hey, Mr. Professor Xu - Time to go in - OK Once you're in there go to the loo and take the micro-earphone from the toilet tank Then I'll tell you what to do Remember Don't play tricks with me If you don't want your daughter back? Just call the police Do that, and she's dead The number you dialed has been transferred to Xu Lisheng's voicemail The shipment has arrived, where should we put it? What are you doing? Stop the car Where's the bathroom? Go straight, then turn right Thanks Jurors I'll be locking the door shortly No one will be allowed to leave If anything comes up, ring the bell and let me know Ok, thank you What do you want? I need you to hypnotize the jury so they will find Lin Ziying guilty of murder in this case The six jurors were carefully selected That paper lists out their backgrounds and weaknesses Make good use of them "Fang Huishan, 25, crippled in a car accident when she was 15" "Feng Xianhui was the driver's lawyer..." You can't fool me like that Everybody's here? First, thank you for choosing me as jury chief There is no time limit for our deliberations But all must be present throughout the discussions It is clearly stated in the law that at least 5 votes are required for a final verdict So I hope we each rely on our conscience and give the Defendant a fair judgement Any objections? No Then let's get started First of all, let's see where we all stand Then we can focus on our differences If there's already a 5-vote consensus there'll be no need for further discussion I think we should respect every differing opinion we may have, so the minority can have a chance to persuade the others Do you agree? Then let's start voting First please raise your hand if you think the Defendant is guilty Raise your hand if you think the Defendant is not guilty Why didn't you two vote? There're too many issues in doubt I can't decide in such a short time What about Professor Xu? I want to refrain from voting for now Why? Because once everyone has voted one way or the other, the discussions will become entirely subjective Sir, do you know your tail lamp is broken? This is a driving violation Sir, your driver's license has expired Please show me your ID Attention all units illegal car race on Qingshan Road One passenger has been injured Vehicle's headed towards Tianying Road All officers nearby be alert for suspicious vehicles Control, suspicious vehicle moving from Wetland Park to Tianci Road, calling for backup Hotpot What's up, Yang Kai? I'm in trouble I'm sending you my location now, come meet me ASAP Boss, we got rid of him, what's next? Search her This girl has a GPS in her watch Get rid of it? Not yet Copy I don't think there's sufficient evidence There's no reason for me to vote guilty - Xu Lisheng - And HK law places freedom above unjustified confinement - You dare play tricks on me? - This case doesn't... - Do you want your daughter to die? - even have any witnesses And the Prosecution's arguments are very shaky Based on... Dad, help! ...the key concept of presumption of innocence, I think... Excuse me, I have a stomach cramp So ll think the court should find Lin Ziying not guilty Don't touch her Don't touch her Let's see How long can your daughter hold her breath ? What are you doing? No, stop Don't You must hypnotize them within 90 minutes Ok, I'll do whatever you want But I need to speak with my daughter every 30 minutes No way Then at least let me ask her a question every 30 minutes What's your question? What did she give me last Father's Day? What did she give her father last Father's Day? Understood, asking her now A bracelet Remember 90 minutes If you dare hurt my daughter I'll turn the rest of your life into living hell Professor Ky, are you OK"? I'm fine, let's continue Mr. Zhou Please explain why you think she's guilty Her lawyer is Feng Xianhui He's Hong Kong's most expensive lawyer He's good at winning cases by finding loopholes in the legal system It's obvious Lin Ziying chose him because she's hiding something So what you mean is Lin Ziying is guilty because she hired Feng Xianhui? She'll go to jail Feng Xianhui has used illegal tactics Feng Xianhui was the driver's lawyer... in 1993 - He.. - Mr. Zhou You've said so much But I'm not sure what it has to do with the case I also have issues with Feng Xianhui In any lawsuit, facts always come before procedure But the minute Feng Xianhui appeared He cited procedural errors to invalidate Lin Ziying's confession at the scene Does that mean even he isn't sure he can win this case? Ms. Fang Your finger Excuse me, I'm going to get a band-aid Let me help you When'd you start? Start what? Biting your finger I'm sorry Maybe it's just my occupational disease Have a cookie It'll help you relax It'll taste better heated up But don't forget to keep an eye on the time Do you smell the chocolate? The scent makes you feel relaxed Very comfortable Very relaxed Very comfortable As time passes by, the scent gets stronger and stronger Smell it again When did you start biting your finger? Will you ever walk again? No Did the driver go to jail? No Did Feng Xianhui help that driver? Yes Is Feng Xianhui helping Lin Ziying? Yes Is Lin Ziying guilty? Yes Ms. Fang Are you ready? Yes Then let's continue Ok Professor Sure Yang Kai Come over here - Are you ok? - Go! Where's the vehicle ? Excuse me Did you see a black vehicle pass by just now? Not that I'm aware of What do we do? Call the police? There are more taxis than police cars in HK, right? Can we use your control channel? This isn't legal Cash What's the plate number? There were no fingerprints on the boat Only fibers from a rag which was different from the other rags on the boat Seems someone's trying to cover up the presence of a third person It's a setup Lin Ziyin owns billions Would she need to kill someone on her own? Ms. Liu You wouldn't kill someone No one would look at nude photos of you anyway What'd you just say? Just saying, don't be angry Lin Ziying is around 19, and she's pretty She'd get mad if someone took nude photos of her It'd be understandable if she killed out of rage Besides, she's even admitted that she stabbed the deceased Wait... Sorry, but the Judge has already said the confession submitted by Lu is invalid Even if the confession's invalid Lin Ziying is still untrustworthy Ms. Fang, I don't quite follow you Lin's two statements were contradictory First she said she stabbed the victim, then she denied it Even though Feng got her confession invalidated It doesn't change the fact that she was lying If she didn't kill anyone Why bother to lie? 5 Justices of the Peace have attested to Lin's moral integrity, which proves her credibility Are we the ones judging this case? Or some random Justices of the Peace? - What's wrong? - What's going on? What happened? Is there anything wrong with the adaptor? I'll go check It's powered off for sure Get the staff Anyone here? Ok, you go ahead What are you looking at? Go open the curtains Me? Ok Powered off? I'll get someone What does that mean, Boss? SOS hovers round the street corner before sunset You ask who I am Steps so tired and broken Why not stop and rest Wash away your burden Au Lisheng That's it? No more? That's it Nothing else Hovers around the street corner before sunset Is this a signal? Useless, it won't be sent out Really? It's time What was the theme of my daughter"s last birthday party? What was the theme of your last birthday party? Purple, purple balloons. Purple balloons The power's back Everyone return to your seats Here's some new information We just found out that May and her husband have purchased 4 million of Lin Group stock options Please continue Someone just said Lin Ziying may have been framed In my opinion They'd have left the body on the yacht if they wanted to frame her So why'd they drop it in the sea? I don't think the murder took place on the yacht Look, according to the police report It was at sea at the time The yacht was the only place they could maneuver on Couldn't there have been a second yacht? Who can guarantee there was only one yacht? Any witnesses? I also think Lin Jiawei... - ...didn't die on that yacht - You've purchased a lot This is the only way to explain it - There are several doubtful points in this case - What do you mean? That's right Looking for this? If Lin Jiawei did die at the crime scene, where's the blood? You're in the corrider of the Court Handing the phone over now Ms Ms Ms You can't bring the magazine in there Oh, ok Take a good look at that financial magazine "If Lin Ziying becomes Chairman, the Board will collectively resign” Remember If Lin Ziying is acquitted - "The Lin Group will face collapse" - The Lin Group will collapse In which case you'll lose everything May If the body was dumped in the sea There should be blood on the deck But blood can be wiped off The body was already in the sea Of course they'd have to clean the blood from the scene Mr. Chow, in the Inspection Bureau's report, besides no mention of any bloodstains there's no indication that the deck was scrubbed May Are you all right? I'm alright This cannot be you You've not shed a tear This is the water area of this case The yacht was found near the Tung Lung Island lighthouse The body was found on Tung Lung Island's beach That day the tide was flowing from east to west If the body fell into the water from the yacht it would have been carried west It couldn't have floated east to Tung Lung So what you mean is the Deceased couldn't have died on the yacht? In my judgement, after Lin Jiying fainted another boat sailed up to Lin Jiawei's yacht And after Lin Jiawei boarded the murderer killed him and then dumped his body on the beach of Tung Lung Island I think Lin Jiawei died on that other boat Go ahead, say whatever you want Mr. Zhou Chen Yongxi has a doctorate in Geography Actually I think Lin Jiawei willingly followed the murderer to the other boat So they knew each other? The Lin Group has athree major factions Though the Defendant has 18% of the Group's shares the Deceased's wife has 15%, and Lin Guoquan and his son have 13% Everyone is a suspect So what you mean is Lin Ziying holds the most shares and therefore is the prime suspect As for the testimony and motive Any other opinions? Mr. Chairman I think we've discussed enough May we proceed to the second vote? Yes Since Professor and Mrs. Feng have yet to vote I doubt anyone opposes this motion? You have 3 minutes for further consideration I hope everyone will vote this time. What's wrong? The toilet. Keep a close eye Uncle Keep quiet Let's go Move! This way "Flammable" Be careful Go Go Uncle Careful, Yang Kai Boss, the guy found us But we finished him off Captain You took care of your comrades back in the day but we caused your discharge I can finally repay you now You must live You hear me? The third question: "On your marks... Get set..." The next is... The answer is "BANG" Then GO! Time's up Professor Xu Please return to your seat Is everybody ready? Let's vote then Raise your hand if you think the Defendant is guilty May You're voting "guilty" now Haven't you always felt Lin Ziying is innocent? Don't mess around This is the High Court We're not children playing some game Mrs. Liu, it's fine for you to change position We must respect all differing opinions But May, I'd like to know the reason why you've changed your vote You don't need to ask May Why not just ask Professor Xu? I just saw May and Professor Xu under the table talking furtively The Judge has said no private discussions are permitted What did you two talk about ? Nothing I think our discussion has been very weird We all know the evidence is insufficient But we voted guilty one after another And May's been the strangest of all I suspect someone is manipulating the jury You mean you suspect Professor Xu? May and I had no private discussion about the case You misunderstand I think Yongxi might just be guessing To be honest, this result surprises me as well, since we all had many doubts Professor Xu, can you please explain? Sure Jury decisions usually turn on three elements: motive, forensic evidence and testimony Now motive and evidence are fully established So I vote guilty Then can you explain the autopsy report? It's written clearly that the Decedent was stabbed in the heart by a sharp object from bottom to top But the knife bore only the Defendant's left hand fingerprints from a backhand grip The wound in the heart was 6¢cm deep Lin Ziying couldn't possibly have killed him from this position It's actually quite simple Just imagine that this is the knife We're on the yacht I'm Lin Ziying You're Lin Jiawei You've already been stabbed in the abdomen If I strangle you from behind then I could Kill you Yongxi, are you all right? Don't surround them Step back, make some room Allow me Yongxi, I'm Mr. Liang Undo the buttons. Make him comfortable Help Someone's passed out How's Chen Yongxi doing? In the ambulance, He'll be ok But the issue is He can't remain on the jury I want to know what happened just now Then you should ask Professor Xu Chen Yongxi said he saw May and Professor Xu talking privately He approached Chen, made physical contact and then the incident occurred We didn't...! Your Honor I think they misunderstand me So did anyone actually see Professor Xu having private talks with others? I understand that in the course of deliberations disagreements often occur I hope everyone can stay level-headed and mind your behavior Though you're now short one juror at least 5 votes are still needed to reach a verdict I hope you will promptly recommence your discussions Understood Thank you So, everyone I'll be straight with you now There's so much at doubt in this case it's impossible to find the Defendant guilty So, I agree with Mrs. Liu Of course if anyone has new evidence feel free to try to persuade us That's right, let's take our time I don't mind that, and after all If we can't reach a final consensus the jury will be disbanded, but my conscience will be clear Sir, you just suffered a seizure Do you have any medicine with you? Hello? Is this Yang Kai? This is Xu Lisheng's friend Chen Yongxi Only ten minutes to go You're still missing one vote I need you to do something for me Professor Xu? Is your stomache really that bad? Boss You never mentioned this before Do it if you want to get paid Don't forget that note What's wrong? Nothing. It's fine Just knocked the kettle over Lisheng Your... What happened? - What is it? - Something exploded? Evacuate, now! You go first It's smoking - Move, - Professor - I'll push her wheelchair - You stay - Come on - Professor Professor Professor Which way? Left or right? Straight, then right Did you write that note? What's going on? Someone's threatening you? Tell me... I'll help you My daughter's been kidnapped Kidnapped? You've got a daughter as well How old is she? Now, please Try to imagine If you were me, what would you do? You'd be desperate to save her Give me your vote Vote Lin Ziying guilty before 3 o'clock ...So that's how you save your daughter No, Lin Ziying is innocent Time's almost up Look at your watch Imagine... at 3 sharp your daughter will be killed If you were me, what would you do? Of course save your daughter, vote Lin guilty Either she's convicted, or your daughter dies No, Lin Ziying is innocent Your daughter's also innocent If you can't even save your own daughter you don't deserve to be her father Now what's going on? Just changed to another chamber We're just about to vote Stand by for my good news Mr. Chairman I think we're all ready We can start the vote Has everyone thought it through? Then let's vote The result is 5 to 1 Guilty Hello? Done Hurry, wrap it all up OK It's all fine now Thank you, Dad It was all my fault I'm greedy Greed is not your fault Your fault is inexperience Embezzlement is such a minor thing Do you really have to Kill for it? The court's almost ready Please wait here I've already done what you asked When will you release my daughter? After the court has adjourned leave with my men, then you'll see your daughter If you don't let her go right now, why should I trust you? You're not in a position to bargain Really? Then I'll just go confess now Haven't you had enough fun? Before court reconvenes take my daughter to Wesson Tower I need to speak to her After the sentencing release her immediately I'll need to make a video call to watch her enter the lift alone If you keep your word I'll leave the court with you That's fair, right?
