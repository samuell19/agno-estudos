WEB-DL / WEBRip / WEB Duration: 1:25:27 FPS: 23.976 I'’ll never forget 1977, all that excitement, all that pride. And it'’s something that I cherish, something that I'’ll take with me until my last breath. And it was something so unbelievable, so wishful, a great, golden place in sport'’s history. May of 1948, a new Jewish state, Israel, was born in a bath of blood. As Israel went before the United Nations to seek a place in that world body, and Middle Eastern Arabic nations were in violent opposition. Newly equipped with Red-manufactured weapons the Egyptian army spearheads the Arab nations, almost solidly aligned against Israel. culminating in an attack by Israel on Egypt. Former Vice President Nixon meets with Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Dayan in Tel Aviv, during a fact-finding tour of Israel. The tension in the Middle East develops into full-scale war with heavy fighting between Israeli and Egyptian forces along the Sinai border. Israeli Chief of Staff, General Yitzhak Rabin visits and inspects troops. Near the Egyptian border. When the UN reject Russia'’s resolution asking for condemnation of Israel as the aggressor in the Arab-Israeli War. I came to Israel for the seventh Maccabiah Games. Traveling around the country, I felt that common history, that common religion. Maccabi Tel Aviv then came to me, and they said, "Look, a Jewish kid from Trenton, New Jersey, you see that the country is going through a recession. People aren'’t smiling. You know, if a player like you would come, you can take our team that never got past the first round in the European Championship games to another level." I went to college at Rider College in Trenton, New Jersey, and this guy was playing at Trenton Central High School by the name of Tal Brody, drafted by the Baltimore Bullets. But decides to go over to Israel to play for one of the first Maccabiah teams. Israeli basketball, in the 1960s, that was not something you'’d like jump up an down and say, "Boy, I can'’t wait to be a part of that." Tal was a member of the US national basketball team. I joined that team as a 17-year-old high school player, and he was the leader. Because of my friendship with Tal Brody, I was able to make it through. Tal turned down everything from the very beginning to be a part of something that is bigger than just his own life. And then they got called up, drafted into the US Army. It was the time of Vietnam. And after I did two years of service, that'’s when Moshe Dayan sent me a note to come back to Israel and to finish what I started. It is a very unusual occurrence for a player who is projected as a very high draft pick to forego an NBA career. He really was responding to a higher calling. And it was amazing, where all of a sudden, Levi Eshkol, the Prime Minister comes to our basketball game. Moshe Dayan, the defense minister, is all the time coming to our basketball games. I saw how proud everybody was every time that we can win a basketball game. He fell in love, and he wanted to do everything that was possible to promote that country. And it just developed in such a way that he suddenly had the vehicle for that. On the basketball court, in the short pants and the jersey, he could make a statement on behalf of Israel. We couldn'’t imagine someone giving up on the NBA. Someone who'’s coming here for the Maccabiah says, "Wow, I see something so great I'’m staying." And we looked at ourselves, you know, saying we do not look that great to ourselves. What is it that he sees in us that we do not see in ourselves? Maccabi Tel Aviv, they had all these players that couldn'’t make it at the NBA level, and so they came because of Tal to Tel Aviv. I played basketball my whole life, and I wanted to go to Europe and play basketball for a year and possibly come back and go to law school. Everybody told me I should go to Israel, go see how the Jews lived, because I'’m Jewish. They said the weather'’s the best, and the girls are the prettiest. I was an undergraduate at Columbia in New York. By my junior year, I said this is not for me. I get on a plane. The idea was that I could play basketball in Israel. Up, up, up! Each of the players contributed something different to the team. Everybody understood that they had a role. And as the year progressed, we fit into these roles more and more. Jim was a pure shooter. So Jim, you know, you could always count on putting the ball in the basket. One of the reasons why he came to Israel is because he loved history. He had just finished reading Leon Uris'’Exodus, and when his agent said, "Oh, I have a team in Israel who has an opening. Would you like to try out?" "Yes." All of the army still had their Uzis. And everywhere we went on the street, we see the guns. This is the BBC. Today, at exactly 12:05 p.m., the forces of Egypt and Syria mounted a major offensive on the southern and eastern borders of Israel. It was Yom Kippur and everything was quiet. And you could hear buses in the background and people on the beach, someone said"Milchamah!" Milchamah means war. There was no basketball. I had no salary. The only reason I survived it was the local grocery store said, "Pay us later." It was a very difficult period for Israel, probably the greatest trauma suffered by the Jewish people since the Holocaust. Two thousand six hundred Israeli soldiers killed in three weeks. Everybody knew at least one person who had died in that war. Everyone was affected by it. Egypt President Anwar Sadat celebrates his victory over the State of Israel with his ally, the Soviet leader, Leonid Brezhnev. It seemed at that point that we could not go any lower or any darker, and then suddenly... this. Nobody remembers it anymore, but there were no air conditioners. The entire country was not air conditioned. We were sweating like crazy, an entire nation. It was tough living. It'’s a country that is still on a healing process from the Yom Kippur War. The economy'’s not doing that great. We were more innocent, and this all came out from this sensation that we are doing something right in a country that is righteous and going somewhere. At the same time that the country went through its troubles, there is this basketball team, Maccabi Tel Aviv, A team is looking for its identity for 10 years is just very close but never touching glory. And there are these American players, one of them, the first one and the most important, Tal Brody. That changed the team, and from that day, maybe the summit of European basketball became closer and closer. That year, I was planning to retire, and I didn'’t want to retire without that cup. And I stayed on. Even though we had the toughest teams in Europe to play against, I felt that we can do it. The teams consisted of five American players who didn'’t make the NBA, most of them Jewish, and three Israeli Sabras. Compared to the other club, we didn'’t have big names that time, really big name, no big players, not somebody from the NBA, but we came to one unit to fight together for each other, to fight for the team, to fight for the country. We felt that we had a strong team, but we were missing something, and we needed a big guy in the center. I had opportunity to play professionally in '’74, and I really thought my career was beginning then. I was the last one that was cut in the Knicks. I went all the way to the end. The Knicks decided that they needed a player with more experience than I had. So it was September, and I still didn'’t have a job. I was playing in Madison Square Garden. The coach was at the game, looking for a player. And he asked me, "Would you like to play in Israel?" So at that time, September with no job, any job I would'’ve said yes to. My first thought that I was going to be doing a lot of praying, you know, all the stories from the Bible and everything. I knew very little then about the Jewish religion. What I remember about Aulcie was he tall and thin, but he was very graceful in his movements. I was very thin. I was a good player, but I was very thin, and Maccabi wanted a real center, somebody that was big. And in the last minute, they brought in somebody, the day before I thought I was flying to Israel. It took all the wind out of me. Both of them were good players, different a little bit in style. But what it came down to was the story about the cake. Remember they had some cake and coffee out for us. The players were sitting around the table, all of them, and there were some cakes on the table. Aulcie Perry took just one. The other guy wanted to eat this and this and that. And I didn'’t know at the same moment that he took those four cakes, Ralph whispered to Shamluk, "If he wants all the cakes, he'’s gonna want to shoot all the balls." The management came to some players and said, "What is your opinion about the player that we can choose?" All of us said, "Aulcie Perry." You can say that those cakes changed the life of Aulcie Perry. The cakes changed my whole life. Professionally, it changed my whole life, gave me, really, a dream. And when I got there, I was really surprised, because we had three great playmakers, which was Motti Aroesti, Bob Griffin and Tal Brody. And then I look, and Miki was also a great player. Jim Boatwright had the hand of gold. He just couldn'’t miss. And Lou Silver was one of the smartest players that I ever been on the court with. So inside of me, I realized that we had a chance to do something. Maccabi Tel Aviv playing for the European Cup Championship, are you kidding me? I mean, this was always dominated by Spain, by Italy, by Moscow and CSKA, all these incredibly powerful and tradition-laden teams. And all of a sudden, Maccabi Tel Aviv, who are these guys? The first game was against Varese, the Cup holders. They had won 10 finals in a row. Our games were a social event. Everybody wanted to be at our game. It'’s like Los Angeles, where you see Jack Nicholson and movie stars at the games. Our games were the event to be at. And as usual, the special guest of honor was Moshe Dayan, the Defense Minister. Moshe Dayan was the most recognizable face in the world at the time, except for Muhammad Ali. He was at every one of our games and shaking our hand. To Jim, to be able to touch and shake a hand with Moshe Dayan, it was almost more important than the game. Why? Why, because Moshe Dayan was Moshe Dayan. Moshe Dayan was someone that almost every citizen of the planet could put his hand on the eye and say, "We know who you are." He was Israel. Moshe Dayan coming to shake the other team'’s hand is intimidation. And with us, he'’s saying, "Let's go. "Let'’s go, let's get '’em." It puts it in perspective. I mean, it'’s not just basketball. Maccabi Tel Aviv at that period of time were strictly a jump-shooting team. The Italians came in and they'’re playing Maccabi in a sold out stadium of 10,000 fanatical Maccabi fans, which is like it should be. - They almost never made a mistake. They didn'’t run. They worked for high-percentage shots, and they made them. They had been European champions five of seven of the previous years. And we were just coming together. When Mobilgirgi came to Israel to play against us, the first game in the European league, they beat us badly, I think more than 20, 25, 30 points. It was embarrassing for us. It was what we call being schooled in basketball. It was really a great exhibition of basketball. They were a far, far superior team than Maccabi at that time. A great shock for the Maccabi players but also a reminder. -You guys are not good enough yet. The only game in nine years that I lost at home. And we lost by 20-something points. You have to win at home. It was like an initiation into what the European league was really all about. I said, "Whoa, this is what I got to deal with?" After we lost that game against Varese, the practices started to be very tough, and I think we started to take the anger out on each other. Every practice that we had was a war, tussling and then hitting, and everybody wanted to win. Jim came home and said he and Miki had gotten in a fight. Each one of the players wanted to be a starter, to play the five starters. I don'’t like to lose anywhere, anytime, any place. Both wanted to be the best. Miki jumps on Jim'’s back, and Jim shrugs him off. And then they'’re running up and down the floor, jabbering and jabbering, and Miki'’s, I think, threatening Jim, again. And Jim just turns around and hit him with such a perfect punch. Miki was out for about 10 seconds. But then he got up. And he got up like a lion. And then he had to be restrained. Then I heard people talking outside. "Oh, whoa, whoa, Jim and Miki." They got it out of their system. And that was the most important thing, that they put it on the table and said listen, you'’re an idiot, because of this one, two, three. You'’re a moron, because four, five, six. I'’m an asshole, because of seven, eight, nine. You do whatever you want, deal with it. We came to the locker room. We and the players talked to each other and said that, "Hey, guys, we'’re in a point that if you would like to survive and to change our attitude, we have to change our system." Real Madrid brought European basketball to a level of continent acknowledgment. It was the first club in Europe that brought American players to play for them, and they started to win and win and win. Real Madrid would beat us every year, because they ran faster than we did. It took us a while to adjust to the way Real Madrid played and the Italian teams played. They were better teams than we were. Jim Boatwright! Miki Berkowitz! And this was an amazing game. People could not believe what they were seeing. Our team played great. We played together. We were fast and furious. And the Spanish team really didn'’t know where we came from with this type of energy. Maccabi comes out and kicks their ass right in front of 10,000 people, and their whole season turned around. For us to win at home against Real Madrid also was a dream. I didn'’t know the importance of it like Tal, because he had a lot of experience with Real. But just the emotion and the excitement after the game, I realized that it was a huge accomplishment for us to beat Real Madrid at home. Why is it such a big thing? Because finally... Jewish teams are kicking ass. Hop, hop! Even though we had the toughest teams in Europe to play against, I felt that we could do it. Tal was the leader of the team, experienced player, and he decided that we should give way to the younger generation and that a player like Miki Berkovich will be the leader of the team without the influence of Tal. Everybody told me that Tal is retiring from basketball. And I knew we'’re gonna have the last one year with Tal. I was a kid that time. I had the chutzpah. I had the confidence that I can be the leader of the team for the next 10 or 15 years. My mom wanted I'’d be an engineer, to be a doctor. One of the best coaches in Israel, Yehoshua Rozin, saw that I didn'’t come to practice for a week. He said, "Why'’s Miki not coming to practice?" They told him that his mother doesn'’t release him, because he had bad grades. They came to my home. I remember now, he came to my home. "Why you'’re not letting Miki go to practice?" She said I was going to be an engineer or a doctor. He told her, "I don'’t think he'’s gonna be a doctor, but he'’s gonna be a professor in basketball." I was the head of sports of Israeli television on the day that they all came up and said Maccabi plays with CSKA. I went and recorded a blessing saying , "Welcome, Moscow, we are coming." But no, we are not going anywhere. The Soviets say no. Moscow, CSKA, they would not come to Israel. There was a real question whether the game could even be played. The Russians said, "We are not going to play Maccabi Tel Aviv, neither in Tel Aviv nor in Moscow." We had no relations with them. They would not play in the state of Israel. We didn'’t exist as far as they were concerned. But then FIBA started to say, "This is not good enough. We think that the Soviets in the basketball field should play Israel." There was a meeting in Munich. Shimon Mizrahi, president, was there representing Maccabi. He says, "We are ready to go tomorrow to Moscow." It was Friday night in Munich. The Russian delegate said, "We are not ready to come to Israel. We are not going to accept an Israeli team, Maccabi Tel Aviv in Moscow." And I said, "You can'’t involve politics with sport. You must come, and you must play in Moscow." So they came to a compromise. They agreed to one game. So technically, they lost one game, the one in Moscow. And the game that was supposed to be in Tel Aviv will be played in a little, dark corner, in a little, little town named Virton. The fact that Israel was playing against the Red Army was in itself a victory, irrespective of the outcome of the game. This was the Red Army that was oppressing three million Jews. The regime that was sending young people like Natan Sharansky to labor camp, because they wanted to be Jewish, because they wanted to be free Jews in their own country. I was an activist of Soviet Jewish movement in Moscow. And you have to understand the political importance of this moment. For Soviet Union, Israel was an enemy, maybe the enemy. There was very hostile attitude towards the State of Israel. For Soviet Union, every expression of solidarity with Israel by Soviet citizens was almost betrayal. Israelis demand that the USSR permit Soviet Jews to immigrate to Israel. The activists call on all civilized nations to take up arms against the spiritual suppression of Soviet Jews. About 200 families have been torn apart. Hundreds of parents go from demonstration to demonstration, from embassy to embassy, demanding the natural right to live with their children. All the leaders of KGB and leaders of the Soviet army, all our enemies, if you can say, their team was CSKA. Officially, it was the team of the Red Army. I played against those guys. They were dirty players. They represented evil, and I didn'’t like that. They knew how to play with force and with power and a sense of physical strength that was emblematic of their culture. If they didn'’t like you, they just took you down, mowed you down. What the Russian determination not to play against Israel in '’77 demonstrates, there are some things that are more important than sport. Even the fact that the game was played in a neutral site was, to me, a huge victory for Israel at the first instance, because they weren'’t letting Russia off the hook. We hadn'’t seen the Russians play. No, we hadn'’t seen them, but what we did know is they beat Real Madrid in Madrid by 20 points the week before. So we knew they were a good team. This is an opportunity to play against this team and demonstrate something. They knew they had the best team in Europe with seven of their players that beat the American team in the 1972 Olympics. Well, Munich was tragedy. It was a horrible thing. Hundreds of TV cameras in place to cover the Olympic games, now trained on this window. Inside, two Israeli athletes are dead. Another nine Israelis held hostage by a group of Palestinian gunmen calling themselves Black September. I was with my wife at the time. And I turn on the TV, and I'’m seeing the guy who was my teacher, Amitzur Shapiro, dead. It was demoralizing that a beautiful thing like the Olympics turns into a massacre and a political thing. I'’m sure the public will agree the Games must go on. To see what went down there, the violation of the code of ethics in sport and in life. Everybody tried so hard to make it right, but you never really can. If you say Munich to the average American, they say "that terror attack." The average American doesn'’t remember that the Russian basketball team stole the medal from the US team. It was ridiculous. The game was over. They added seconds on. It was as though they were predetermined that the Soviet Union was going to win it. When I go back and look at Munich, me, when we won it in regulation, I would'’ve walked off the court and say, "We'’re not coming back. Do whatever you want with the gold medal." Three seconds. There is time for the Russians to go to their big man Alexander Belov. They'’re going to try. Let the world decide, on television, who won this game. And this time it is over. This was one of the biggest crimes in sports history, definitely the biggest crime in basketball history, a basketball sporting injustice. It would hurt me, the way that they treated the Americans in the Olympics, and I knew that I'’m gonna face seven or eight of these players this night. Just by the fact that you'’re from Israel playing in Europe, this is already a political situation. When you play the Russians, it'’s doubled, it's tripled. And we were targets. That was a big education for me. All of a sudden, I'’m a target, because I'’m a basketball player for an Israeli team. I developed a Jewish identity very fast. This was the peak of the Cold War between the United States and the Soviets. Don'’t forget, this was very, very heavy time. Any team playing the Soviet Union, if it wasn'’t an Eastern European team, was playing against the enemy of the Western world. And for Maccabi, I would say, it just added motivation to slay the giant. For some reason, I hired a TV crew to follow us, Maccabi Tel Aviv, to Virton. Virton is an armpit in Belgium. I don'’t know why there was an inner voice that told me to tell the story of the great defeat or a great victory. ♪ Happy birthday to you♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you♪ ♪ Happy birthday dear Miki♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you♪ This is my birthday, 17th February. They brought me cake. The management, Shamluk and the coach Ralph Klein said it'’s a big day for us. We'’re playing first time against CSKA Moskova. Thank you very much for everyone who had their share in this cake and everything. And well, I got a small wish, too, like Shamluk told us. I would like that everybody would play for me and for the team and for the country too. And let'’s win this game and it will be a history for us and for everybody. Thank you very much. You can see, in the video that I shot, how nervous he is by rolling his finger all the time around the button of his shirt, while just thanking his friends, his comrades, from Maccabi Tel Aviv team, for providing him with a birthday cake. Not a big deal on a day-to-day, but that was not a normal day. That was a day that they marched into the court fearing what they have to do not to be embarrassed. I want to tell you something, that nobody talks about. I was very, very friendly with the players in CSKA. Always we met secretly in the hotel, and with the players, I had a meeting in the rooms, talking about our lives, how their life is harder in Russia. We exchanged with them a lot of things, like chewing gum. They didn'’t have chewing gum in Russia. Security agents that came from Russia, they were watching them, and they were very scared that somebody would hear or see that they are meeting us. The head coach of CSKA Moscow, Alexander Gomelsky, a Jew, and it so happen that one morning, I get out of my room, to go down for breakfast. From the other side of the corridor was Mr. Gomelsky. He came out of his room also going for his breakfast. I presented myself. I said I'’m Mike Karnon from Tel Aviv, a journalist. He asked me "How come that you Israelis, from Asia, play in the European Cup and all your team is American players?" Our coach Ralph Klein was a holocaust survivor. He really didn'’t talk about this to the team, but we knew that this game was extremely important for him and we wanted to play also for him. There'’s some coaches, they treat the players as though they'’re chess pieces. Basketball doesn'’t work like that, because it'’s too fast. You have to make decisions. You prepare them, but you have to be able to trust your players. Ralph was a player'’s coach. Now it helped that he gave very good motivational speeches. After the speech, all of us, we were so excited and so ready to play, if he would'’ve said, "Run through the wall." I think all of us would'’ve jumped up and ran through the wall. I walked in. I'’m saying, "What is going on here?" There'’s 400 seats. 400 Israelis, all the gym, I mean, Israelis or Jews from Europe. They filled up. All 400 were connected to Israel. I said, "This is more than just a game. This is much more than a game." Maccabi! Maccabi! For the Russian team, it was like they got shell-shocked. They didn'’t know where they were, whether they were in Israel or where. Well, you know, the difference in the teams probably was about 20 points. CSKA Moscow was probably 20 points better than Maccabi Tel Aviv at that time. It was their national team. And Maccabi had a bunch of Americans and a couple of Israelis, and they were like, it was like, you know, Goliath against David. The first game in history between Moscow and Maccabi Tel Aviv. I started the game out with two or three blocked shots from their players. Griffin... Perry. I don'’t like to talk about myself, but I think it changed the whole complex of the game, because they didn'’t look for the inside position no more. Griffin passes to Lou Silver. There is such a thing as basketball intelligence. The IQ of this team in basketball intelligence was off the charts. Eric, Lou, Aulcie they were passers. The ball would go into the middle, Aulcie or someone will take the ball and pass it under to someone open underneath the basket. When the game started, I suddenly realized that that was not just an ordinary game. Aulcie Perry. And they played a great game right from the start. And the Russians, experienced players as they were, they didn'’t believe what was going on. And the buzzer for the halftime finds Maccabi Tel Aviv leading by three points over Moscow. And I'’m looking at Alexander Gomelsky. He didn'’t know exactly what'’s happening. It took them some time to get back into the match. I thought that well, I don'’t know how long Maccabi can hold in this position. From the beginning, we had the lead. Easily basket, fast breaks, shooting from corners. Everything was going fine for us, and Russia was like in a coma. I don'’t know, It's not the team that we expected that we should play against them. Suddenly the monster that played against us was a midget. A long pass to Brody. Brody has fallen. The songs and the cheering were incredible. You thought that you were sitting in Madison Square Garden with 20,000 people, and not 500 Israelis. I was sitting next to Gideon Hod, who was broadcasting that on the radio. We couldn'’t believe what was going on. And Gideon asked me, "Mike, are you crying?" I said, "Yes, I am!" And both of us were in tears. And I'’m going to the camera to get some reactions from the players. I came to Tal Brody. It just came out of my heart when Alex Gilady, by chance, caught me as I was going off the floor. He said something that was in our hearts, but we didn'’t know how to use words for it. And here comes this barely Hebrew-speaking American and gives you the slogan that you can use for generations to come. We are on the map, not just in sport but in everything. And if they can do that, they can do anything. But I understood him in saying that we'’re on the map in basketball. I didn'’t realize what he was saying. And I must say, it was a prophetic statement that he made. He reminded us all that not so long ago, less than 30 years before that, there was no Israel on the map. So the fact that we are on the map is significant. There are sentences that take you from one stage to another. And you have to remember we are still at the time where Jews all around the world feel that there will be no third chance. You cannot take an atlas or a map anymore without Israel being on it. And he said it out loud for everybody else. To me, Israel was always on the map, but there was no reason to expect, or even to hope, Maccabi could beat Red Army Moscow. Everybody in America remembers the great victory of the American ice hockey team over the Soviet team, the Miracle on Ice. Do you believe in miracles? Yes! But everybody in Israel remembers the Miracle on Hardwood. You couldn'’t compare tiny, tiny Israel to the vast Soviet Empire. When in the evening we heard on Voice of America that Israeli team won, we were more than happy to say to our KGB interrogators, "Well, maybe you don'’t know, maybe you didn'’t hear, but your team, your team, KGB team, lost to our young team." It was a very happy moment that we could say to KGB. A few weeks after this, I was arrested, and for nine years I disappeared from this world. And the voice, "We are on the map", was always causing me a smile, even in the darkness of Soviet prison and was giving me a feeling that we are on the map. We will win. Once we landed at Ben Gurion, I just couldn'’t believe I'’m looking out over a wave of people. The excitement was just too much, too much. I wanted more, I wanted more. As a team, they brought honor to this country. It makes me have goosebumps. I feel like I helped do that because I fed Jim. I washed his clothes. I feel like I'’m part of that. Thursday nights, the streets were empty. You couldn'’t get a taxi. There was one station and the whole country sat down to watch Maccabi Tel Aviv on Thursday. Basketball was the number one topic in Israel. No weddings, no Bar Mitzvahs, not everybody had a TV, so everybody would go to somebody'’s house. Why would you go to the movies when the best show in town is on TV, Maccabi Tel Aviv against whoever it is in the European championship? Nothing moved, nothing moved. Whole families sat together. It was like a reunion, a family reunion. All the family, all the friends, sat together to watch Maccabi. It wasn'’t that long after the Yom Kippur War. The country was starving for something that lifted the country. And every day that I went out on the streets, it was like there'’s so much warmth and love that it gave me more power. It gave me more initiative for us to be the best. It was just amazing. Open it. Wow, it'’s a picture of Maccabi Tel Aviv. Here'’s Tal Brody. He'’s the captain. Am I right? Yes, you'’re right. Say, mister, you'’re tall. Are you a basketball player? Yes, I am. Hey, are you Tal Brody? Yes, I'’m Tal Brody. Rafi, he'’s Tal Brody. Tal Brody is here. Bend your knees, and push the ball away from you to the basket. Going to the Kirya and meeting Rabin was very special. Yitzhak Rabin, if people don'’t know, was a basketball freak. I sat at a wedding one day, and he came over, when he was head of our country, and he sat down for an hour-and-a-half. He knew everything about basketball. It was amazing. I mean, I looked at the guy. I said, "You know, you got armies to worry about, and you'’re talking to me about the Knicks losing. I mean, what'’s your story?" The story was something that Israelis wouldn'’t think twice about today, and that is having a dollar account in the United States. But back then, it was illegal, and it was discovered that Yitzhak Rabin'’s wife, Leah, had such an account. It was felt as a kind of breach of trust, because it was a sign of privilege. Every other week, I was in another country. Here it is, this kid from the inner city of Newark, New Jersey, who grew up very tough. Now I'’m seeing the world. I'’m in London. I'’m in Rome. I'm in Milan, you know. I'’m in Paris. This also was something that captured me. I'’d been talking to rabbis and studying, not really study, but talking, trying to get an understanding of the Jewish religion. I went to Shimon, and I said, "Shimon, look, you know, I want to convert." He said, "Aulcie, you know what you'’re doing? You sure you know what you'’re doing?" I said, "Yeah, Shimon, I want to go through the process." I studied five days a week. Then it came time for, you know, I had to sit in front of the three big rabbis and the questioning and everything. And at the end, they accepted it. I was already circumcised, but they had to make another incision, and I'’ll never forget that. They laid me on a bench and said their prayer, pshht, did a little incision, not the whole thing but just to draw blood, and that was it. Our club, it was not a rich club. And the team couldn'’t put us in hotels. They didn'’t have money to put us in hotels, so we came to the Jewish temple. And each player went to another family to sleep overnight there. And they gave us a nice, warm hospitality. And it was the beginning. After that, now they have the five-star hotels. We had a historic chance now to go to the finals, but we were dependent on who would be the winner between Russia and the Italian team. If the Italian team would win, then we would be out, and they would play against Real Madrid. Now if the Italian team would lose, that means they would play against us. Mobilgirgi needed to lose, so they played against Maccabi, instead of Real Madrid. CSKA beat Varese, which left Maccabi Tel Aviv as the team to make the final against Varese. My first thought was "damn, we'’ve got to see Varese again." And I lost to them twice. But this is for the championship. Varese is Italian, very strong team. They have Meneghin, Bob Morse. They have players that I was scared to play against. I was young. They were 30, a lot of experience. They took the European Championship with the national team, or as they beat us in Tel Aviv by almost 30 points. One interesting thing that Coach Klein did was that in one of the practice he canceled and showed us a movie on Entebbe. The idea was they will kidnap a plane. They will have demands. We will have no other choice but to surrender. And Entebbe was telling everybody this time is over. Nobody'’s gonna tell us ever again that we have no choice but to surrender. We have had, historically, we had enough of that. In 36 minutes, Israelis killed seven hijackers and 20 Ugandan soldiers. The results of Israel'’s weekend raid to rescue more than 100 hostages from pro-Palestinian hijackers at Entebbe airport in Uganda. The rescue operation has been hailed as audacious and as a blow to terrorists around the world. The news of the rescue spread fast with excited and near hysterical relatives and friends of the Israeli hostages, gathering at the airport to await their triumphant return. It sent a clear message for all of us. The State of Israel will send airplanes to the end of the world to bring Jews free. After I was arrested, and for all those years, each time when I heard the engine of the airplane in the skies of Siberia, it was reminding me immediately: Entebbe. And I would think that they will come, and the Israeli airplane will come. The fact that such an inspirational movie before such an important game coming up, I think all of us knew that the whole country was behind us. This was one very inspiring moment, in which Israel'’s ability to take your destiny in your own hands, make your own rules, the way you want to. This was the new Jew. This was the new Jewish destiny. Everybody wanted to travel to Belgrade, where the final was taking place. Here was another problem, because Yugoslavia, like Russia, didn'’t have diplomatic relations with Israel, El Al flights cold not land in Belgrade. The Yugoslav government gave special permission, which allowed many Israelis who wanted to make the final to get to Belgrade. In Belgrade, about six planes landed on the same day of the game. Maccabi went to Belgrade about two days before the final but without Tal Brody. Tal Brody asked to go to the States on the days before we went to Belgrade, to the final. And I didn'’t hesitate for a second. I remember that I was at the swimming pool. The American embassy got a message to us that my father had a heart attack. He'’s in intensive care. You know, here I am, before the European Championship. This is what I came to Israel for, to take the basketball from a team that never went past the first round of the European Championship, and here we have the chance to take the European Championship. Even though that this is a 10-year dream, a father'’s a father. This is the biggest moment in his life. This is what he has spent everything, all the sacrifice, all the practice, all the dreams, all the pain, all the suffering, and he'’s carrying the burden, not only his individual burdens, but he'’s carrying the burdens of his whole country, except his dad is dying. And he goes home to New Jersey, and this is just days before the championship game. He didn'’t fly with us, and we didn'’t know if he could join the team or not. The management told us that we can play without Tal Brody, wow. We started to think about what each one has to do individually to make up for that. We'’re losing our captain. When I got to the hospital, I saw my father was in intensive care. And I waited a day and another day, and he was fine. He opened up his eyes, and he saw me. He was saying to me, "Hey, what are you doing here?" His dad turns to Tal and says, "Tal, you got to go back. They need you. We need you. I can'’t do anything else, Tal." And Tal left his dad there. And he went back. And Maccabi, they said that there'’ll be a ticket waiting for me at JFK Airport in New York. I go to the counter of JAT Yugoslavian Airlines, give my name and my passport, and they said, "Well, you'’re not listed here on the plane. "There'’s no ticket for you." And I said, "What do you mean no ticket? I have to get to Belgrade for the finals of the European Championship." I asked for the station manager, and the station manager, he saw me play during the World Championships in Yugoslavia, and he remembered me. Tal and I had been there in Belgrade in 1970 for the World Championships, playing together. And this guy knew Tal from watching him play seven years before, and said, "Come on, Tal, just come on the plane." And he let me fly on JAT without a ticket. Can you imagine? Like, I'’m thinking today, in New York at JFK, to get through the security to go on a plane without a ticket? Impossible. He came a day before the game. He didn'’t practice, only did a warmup with us. And he gave me confidence that he'’s with us, together, and we could do it. I remember that Ralph Klein told us Varese is a small city in Italy. There is only one main road with a shop selling shoes. If they will win, the next day people will wrap fish with the newspaper, but if you win, you will win glory for life. Around 9 o'’clock the city streets started to clear. The cafes are open. They'’re probably waiting for a victory that will bring in the customers. And they'’re off. Jim Boatwright with the ball to Berkowitz. Motti Aroesti passes the ball to Silver. Meneghin is now open. Two more points from Meneghin. Everybody expected Maccabi to get blown out. It was amazing seeing the Italian team, who was better, much better, not playing their regular game. The game against Varese went, the first half, exactly according to the tactical plan of Coach Ralph Klein. Let'’s get it from the heart, man, let'’s go. During the first half of the game, I was in Belgrade commentating the game. The head of news is saying Prime Minister Rabin is going to call his resignation, live, and we will have to stop the game. It was sort of a shock. The teams are neck-in-neck. And in the middle of this neck-in-neck competition, the Prime Minister of Israel resigns. But the guys in Jerusalem were saying, "Can'’t he wait?" And I think it was very easy to convince him to wait until the end of the game for his live transmission resignation, rather than to stop the transmission, which would have upset many, many, many, many people. Two points for Jim Boatwright. Then in the second half, Maccabi started to lose the ability to score points. And then Ralph brought in Tal Brody that just came back 24 hours before. And he came into the court and with a great save of a ball, brought it back into the game. That'’s a sweet one. In the moment of weakness, when things started to look bad, they still had... Tal Brody. Aroesti... Behind the stage of Israel'’s national theater. In the moments between their stage appearance, the actors run to check what'’s the latest on the television. It'’s a tied game, 61-61. Ossola hurries up. Aulcie Perry blocks him. Ossola... The Italians steal the ball, off Yaffe. And Bellini is precise. Aulcie, Aulcie dribbles towards the basket, tries, tries to shoot. Ossola passes the ball to Meneghin. Meneghin to Bisson, and he misses. Nice, Jimbo, yeah, yeah. I'’ve very proud of what he did. And I just think maybe God was guiding his hand in his shot. And then, 12 seconds to the end, Maccabi Tel Aviv is leading by one point. Silver gets the ball, and suddenly... A gutsy call. Listen, it was a tough call. It'’s a tough call to make at the end of the game, whether I traveled or not, possibly, I don'’t remember. But, you know, I don'’t know. I might have traveled. I might not have traveled. I'’ve watched the tape. It'’s hard to tell. I remember myself angrily saying, "David Turner called walk." I don'’t know if they had possession. Maccabi Tel Aviv wins the European Champion'’s Cup. When tourists heard that Rabin resigned, they didn'’t understand why everyone was celebrating like that. They were really mixed up. They said, "How could everybody be so happy that the Prime Minister resigned from office?" It'’s a few minutes before 11 a.m., and a new Prime Minister of Israel, Menachem Begin, arrives at the President'’s residence. 1977 was a very special year for me. As a commentator, I commentated the games of Maccabi Tel Aviv. But then, I came back home, and I was the executive producer of the elections. The Labor lost the helm of this country to Begin for the first time in its history. Then three months later, in November... Sadat is coming to Jerusalem. The fact that the President of Egypt would get on an airplane, lands on what was then called Lod Airport and declares that there will be peace. Nobody in their wildest imagination believed that this was going to happen. It was euphoria. I couldn'’t believe it. You know, I mean, it was a TV show on at 1 o'’clock in the afternoon of him landing, coming down and hugging people. All of a sudden, you know, it was like he didn'’t need an army down in Egypt. As Tal Brody said, 1977 put us on the map. It put us on the map, diplomatically, with the peace process. It put us on the map in terms of our relationship with the United States. I'’m so proud of both of you. And along comes this basketball game. To live through that period today, as I'’m telling you, it gives me the chills. I would describe it like the little caboose that could. What happened, because of that championship, is that Maccabi actually became one of the most important club teams in the world. And because I happen to be Jewish, it made me very happy and proud, because it told me that the sport itself would be a big enough stage for everyone. From that day, Maccabi Tel Aviv, their victory against CSKA was the end of Israeli sport "losing with honor." In 1977, I was the MVP of the NBA on the world champion Portland Trailblazers. And when we heard that Maccabi Tel Aviv and Tal Brody won the European Cup Championship, I was never more proud in my entire life. It is easily one of the greatest sporting accomplishments ever. Chris Boatwright, widow of Jim Boatwright. I will tell you that Jim wanted to play professional basketball in the United States. He wanted to go to the NBA, and it didn'’t happen. Something better happened. We got to come to Israel. And so, that game was like winning the NBA to him. It was the first, like the first girl you kissed, and you'’ll never have a first again, because we were the first. We'’re the sweethearts. And no one can replace us. It'’s a feeling, I don'’t have the words to describe it. Anywhere in the country I go, it'’s like I'm still a player in Maccabi today. I'’ll never forget 1977, a year that our little country stepped up and earned its place on the map.
