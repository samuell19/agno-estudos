Dedicated to the 30th anniversary of the uprising of the Croatian people. All events are based on true events, and described in Ivan Sibl's war journal. Do we have to die before we get to... To the battalion. Do we have to die? Are you insane, you crazy fool? What did I tell you? Why are you showing off, you stupid hillbilly? Look what you did! What are you yelling about? It's same for the both of us. You had a little bath and started yelling. Now we'll create some fire huh? You'll be dry in no time. Listen all this yelling... You're so impulsive... Really impulsive. You don't know... What's most important. If you'd know the most important, you'd shoot me. You'd shoot me to death, I swear. Say... You have a letter. What letter? - I don't know, they say it's from Zagreb, from your wife. Look at the letter... Here, take it. When we get to the battalion, report to the commandant. To report to the commandant? - You do have a commandant, right? Of course I do. What kind of battalion is the one without a commandant? I'm the commandant, God damn you! Come on, get up. We don't have much time. What's with all this sitting? We have to get to shooting before dark. What shooting? - They're shooting some degenerate. And it's nice when the battalion commandant is present, I mean you like a politician, me like a commandant. Come on, get up. Why did you start the fire in the first place? - How should I know, it's in my blood. Shepherd is starting fire as soon as he sits down. Is there any more rivers here? - Why do you ask? Because of swimming huh? There isn't, don?t worry. THE PINE TREE IN THE MOUNTAIN How could he run away, God damn you? - Go and ask Nikola. This is a big disgrace my friend. All these people came... How could he run away? I fell asleep. How could I know that a Home Guard soldier will run away? Did you know who he was? We didn't tell him, and it's not important. The worst part is that he had a death sentence, and he got away. Go outside. Say Lazo, what will you tell these people? - What could I say? They'll shoot him. People must have confidence in us. An army would fall apart here in a blink of an eye. We have to create confidence, there's... - Fell asleep on watch... Will you sleep here? - There's no time, we have to get in action early tomorrow so it would be good if politician can get to know the battalion. - Hello comrade. Come to pick up the report when you leave. Will you allow them to kill the boy? Lazo knows what he's doing. He's from around here. He was in Spain, and I don't know... Say... Listen, I know it's silly to tutor a man how to live today, especially if you don't know will you wake up tomorrow. There's no future for a man in war, right? Late Adam used to say that. He was former politician. But whatever, I'm telling you, No one knows better then these people how to hunt for venison here. Or, for example, how to dibble potato. Or who to execute here. Let's leave that to them. Personal ID of the member of armed forces And because of this scum, honest boy will get killed. We'll see each other! We'll see each other, even if that's my last thing! What are you doing with captured Home Guard soldiers? On the headquarters orders we disarm them, and send them home. You won't believe me, but I captured some of them two or three times. You're sleeping huh? Sleeping, damn you! They're good for getting weapons. - Do any of them join the partisans? They do, if you scare them good. And some are volunteers. And you won't believe, after that, they become the best fighters. Hey Markeza, one of them is rookie for sure. - I think so too. Let's check. Hey, Home Guard soldiers! Surrender! Charge! Move, move. Drop your weapons. Hurry, hurry! Come on fattie! We see each other again mister commandant. - Fuck your mister, get lost! This is not good. - You think this is a wedding? My dear, you can lose you head here. Listen, I play accordion. That will save your life for sure. Get lost! There's an ustasha among them. - Ustasha. - He says he's on leave, and went with them. A real ustasha in uniform? - In uniform, of course. He spit on me, and insulted my mother. Tie him up. Hey, you! What can you play? - Everything. Love songs... - Love songs in war? Do you know that cow kicked me in the ear as soon I was born? Love songs in war? In war! You Home Guard soldier shame! Get over there! Love songs... Ivan! Listen, their officer says that... - He's our sympathizer. How do you know? - Every captured Home Guard soldier officer is saying that he's a partisan sympathizer. It's not the first one I captured. What should we do with him? - You're asking me? You are politician, you know. If you don't ask, every fighter will tell you. First, disarm him, take his bag. Does he have a watch? He does. - Take it and give it to me. Then you ask him nicely, will he join us. Then you'll see what will that partisan sympathizer tell you. Mouse! - Yes? - What's that over there? - Ican... Ican again? - You didn't tell me do you smoke. Take one. Light it up. There was all kind of cases. One time, we shot a home defender officer. And later, from the headquarters, all blame on politician. 'It's your fault'. 'You had to know. Who will if you don't'? It turned out that he was our man, and and important man. Why did you took his cigarettes and lighter? Politician, you save his head, I'll give it back easily. Stop! - I'll show him. - Take it easy, Ican. Who told you to tie him up? Let him go mate, let him go. Anyway, there's no mercy for ustashas. It's better before the trial. It's Dikan fault for not tying him. - I see that you're not stupid. Hey Markiza, come on load them up. Say, where's the guy with an accordion? Come here. Let me hear that love song. Listen. What's the name of that fighter that shot? - Ican, your Croat. But he's a great shooter, isn't it? What are we waiting for now? - You, to make a speech. What speech? - For the Home Guard soldiers, you know... 'We are fighting for the right cause against occupant and his servants, join us in your free will' And they'll say 'We prefer to go home'. And that's how it ends almost always. Markeza? Where's Markeza? Go with Markeza. He's singing nice. Well done. But maybe he should sing louder, from the throat. But this way, from the soul, that's good too. Well done. Say, where did you learn that? It's nothing, I played in bars. - It's something, it's good. Say, would you stay in partisans voluntarily? - I would! You would? - I would. - Alright, we heard, alright. Shall we really join them? - Didn't you see what happened to that guy? He was an ustasha, a real ustasha, that's completely different. - Screw that. Ivan? What is it, Mouse? Deliver a short speech, talked them in. You better do it, until I manage a bit. - Wait a minute, It's more effective if croat politician do it. Anyway, they're afraid of me. Home Guard soldiers, listen up! Croatian partisan, political commissioner of our battalion will speak to you now. Home Guard soldiers, we know that you're put against your will to the service of the occupant and his servants, degenerates of our Croatian people. We, partisans, fight for the right thing. We're fighting for brotherhood, for equality, and who wants, can join us the bravest and best sons of our people. - We prefer to go home. Me! Me! - Me! Is there anyone else who wants to join People's Liberation movement? What is it? You're scared, right? - Yes, mister, you are smart. We are poor, villagers, we prefer to go home. Alright, you'll go home. - Well done. But you'll understand us, we don't have our factories. And your masters will give you everything you need when they gather you again. And because of that, who wants to go home, will go with naked but, understand? In his underwear! Remove everything else! Mister commandant, in front of the miss? You're a lousy man, undress you Home Guard soldier shame! Undress, come on! Why are you so down? - I made a lousy speech. I should've prepared. - Come on, it would be the same if the God talked to them. They are villagers, and they are smart. They never go in the heat, never. What is forcing them to join us? Nothing. You think I'd collect my people if I didn't put knife under their throat? The officer stayed. - That's suspicious. We should keep an eye on him, maybe he's a spy. God damn him! What are you doing, God help you? You said we can go home. - I said that to them! And you said that you're joining the partisans voluntarily. And listen, from now until the end of the war, you can only desert. But then, there's only one end for you, a bullet! But I have a wife and child. - Well, that's a big trouble. Many of us don't have to worry about that anymore. They killed and buried all, now we're like the birds on a tree. It's easy for us to go in the woods, huh? Come on man, don't be stupid. Is anyone here from his village? - Me, sir. There, he'll tell your family. - Yes. You jerk, you fool. You made a fine mess. What shall I do now? - Nothing, shut up. And run in the night, you fool. Give this back to him when you talk to him. Will you talk to him? You know, 'Where you're going, who's sending you?' Listen to me, I won't teach you something you know better then me. I'm not a politician, damn it! Home Guard soldiers, what are your commands? Attention! On the right! Marching start! In running pace! Song! Sing, army of Ante Pavelic, damn you! Do you see? You see how you were, and how you'd still be if you hadn't join our army voluntarily. Run under women skirts! Faster! You see man, you'll enjoy all kind of jokes and pranks here. And your running plans you can attach to the frost and put above the fire. I'll tell you something that I wouldn't tell my father if he'd be alive. It's been so long since I was so, happy like that song of yours, and that paunch you're stretching. You won't touch a gun, I'll keep you safe, and you just play sometimes. Long live! - But I have a wife and child. The most important for them is that you stay alive. So don't try to run, or I'll kill you. I'm telling you. Do you understand? There, we took care of that too today. Majority of the German units is going from Karlovac, Sisak and Petrinja. One motorized troop is going from Zagreb to Bjelovar. Where did you find that out? - From higher sources. Battalion commandant. Go on, who's your higher source? - I can't reveal that. And we should just trust you, right? My documents will follow me. - Along with enemy ambush if we believe you! Comrade, I understand your distrust, but it's my duty to warn you. You're in touch with the first units that are cleaning the field. I didn't hear your name. - Ivo Jurica. Ivo Jurica? And I should guess what is your first name? Take him with you. Mouse, are you done already? - Yes! - Get in order and move! Ican, take the prisoner. Am I a prisoner? - No, you captured me! - Let's go. Take your weapon. Do you know something more vivid, some army song, but not fascist. I know. The pine tree in the mountain. - You'll play that when we enter the village. You don't trust him? - Not a word. You heard his name, Ivica Jurica, come on! And if he's telling the truth? - We'll run, it's not my first time. What about him? - If he's ours he'll run with us, if he's theirs, he'll run to them. But we'll kill him. Come on, comrades! You go in the front. Come back home. - Calm down, please. If you don't come back home I don't know what I'll do. I don't have control, I think I'll start screaming in the street. - You don't know what you're saying. I'm pregnant. You can't judge our child and me to be your hostages. One day, when they capture you, we'll be in prisons and camps. You know what happened to Amod's wife and child. If anything happens to you, if they capture you or kill you, I'll kill the child and myself! Pleasure huh? It's completely different with music! Dikan, the courier has arrived from headquarters, says it's urgent. - Fine! Take politician with you. I'll follow you. Come on. No headquarters will ruin this joy for me, understand? Vividly, vividly! This means that the officer was telling the truth. - Of course. Why didn't you believe him then? - I still don't believe him. He was telling the truth so he could earn my trust, and when he does, then he knows what do I think and what will I do. We'll play pal, we will! We're staying in the region, that's the order from headquarters. Show me something on that officer map. Tell me, where is our village here? - Over here. Now tell me how all dogs are trying to get our bones? We have information that from here, here, here, here, are only two passes free. - This is the river? - Yes. And what's this? - Grabovac. - That's the strongest ustashas stronghold. On the hill above the village is the former Falcon home. Around there everything is mined, except the road that goes trough the stronghold. There are walls, bunkers, machine guns, wire all around. No one is expecting us there, or anyone would go there. What's your suggestion? Nothing. Let me eat like a man, it could be my last. Headquarter will probably go across the river. - Of course. They expecting it there. That's why we must perform an action. One hard action so they think that we're the headquarters, so they lose attention on the river. How many ustashas is in the Grabovac? - Around 80. That's not too much. - You don't say? It's enough for that fortress. And how we can attacked them? We can't without a cannon and a mine thrower. Why are you so jumpy? Like you have flies in your stomach. How far is Grabovac? About an hour of fast walk. Why do you ask? Get up! Come on, get up comrades partisans, come on. Get up! Look at this! Why are you sleeping, get up! Get up damn it! Are we army or... - Peasants! Ican, what will you do if we win this war one day? And things won't be, as Adam used to say, 'torturing man on man'. What late politician used to say, that applies only for working class, not peasants. And proper term is not torturing, but exploitation! Enemy offensive has started. We have the task to stay in encirclement. We will wear Home Guard soldier uniforms, with us we will carry, now listen well, only partisan hat with red star. Will we have breakfast? - Bring just partisan hat with a star, well hidden! If they let us in, the better, If not, only you know their military terminology. You'll go inside, say that the troops are tired from marching, and ask him to receive us. Are you able to do that? I think I am. Agreement about attacking is still on. From commanders room you'll see the whole situation, is that right, Dikan? When you see we are placed good, shoot the commandant. That will be our signal to attack - Does Home Guard soldier officer has some batman along side him? No, I'm a junior officer. You don't trust me? - No. - You don't have trust? - I don't. Dikan, we can still give up. - No, we won't. We thought of all that, we got ourselves in the shit, and we'll swim in them! And you... Let me tell you something. If you betray us, I swear, with everything I love, I'll kill you! I will, I swear to God and Virgin Mary, to Christ's wounds, I swear to everything that I believe, and I don't believe, I'll kill you! So you know it... And now... Let's go. Hey, Ican! It seems that someone's coming. - Wait. Do it quickly. Don't stop! - Come on. Play! - I'm scared, mister. - I said play, it's too late to be scared. Not that! Some their, fascist! - That one's good for everyone. - Alright, play. If accordion doesn't save us, nothing will. - Didn't I say who's scared should stay home? I must've missed that. - Wash your ears next time! - Really? - Come on! He's grumpy. - Sure, If someone lead me to death like this, I'd kill him! You still have doubts? - It's too late now, now it's best to pray. Well do it. - It's late for that too. - Stop! We stooped. - Who's going? 36th battalion from Petrinja. - One forward, others stop! Do you hear him? He's shouting like an ox. Get of that road, lie down, did you hear me? Act stupid! Stop! - I stopped! Combat call! I don't know your combat call. We don't have the same recognition signs. Why are you bothering me? Call the commandant! Open it. Come in. Just you! Just you. Now we can just put salt on his tail. - You need salt in your head. You came without announcement. And you don't know the recognition signs. If you'd find less intelligent guard he could've kill you all, and he'd be rewarded for that. Machine gun will work, you damn partisans! Just a peasant, trying to scare us. If they want to, they kill us when we go inside. What will happen if I throw a bomb huh? Why didn't you come out with that bomb on the place where we were last night? Sir commandant, don't tempt the devil, these are not Home Guard soldiers. Shut up! Play that song of yours. - Sir, I'm scared like mad. I said, play! This is taking too long. Are you sure that our sympathizer is not arranging with ustashas how to kill us? All of a sudden, we're all smart. My shoulder is sore. - It's the weather, it'll rain. If I could plow the field and sow. And look where are we sitting, damn it! If the ground is good for the wheat, it'll be good for you too. - What? One meter wide, two meters deep. - God forbid! Home Guard soldier is singing nice. He's griping, Dikan is dispersing fear with him. That's the song of those who are walking trough the cemetery at night, and they wash their underwear tomorrow. Come on chickens, get in! Fuck me if I'm not scared. On who's orders did you leave? Headquarters in Petrinja. - So they are assholes too. They're sending you on the road without announcement. It's very dangerous here at night. On day... Not so much. Partisans are around here. Once, we could've rob and pillage. But today... It's good you didn't run into them - You have to, sooner or later. They can't touch us here. Hey you, come here for a sec. Come here! Is that an accordion? It is. - How many basses? It is, it is. - I'm asking how many basses. I don't know... I do, 80. - Can I try for a while? Sure, take it. Say mate, is that hill 17? - What do you care? - I'm just asking. Explosive. No smoking. Are you away from home long? - Long. Who's that on the picture? This is my cow, this is my mother, and this is mu wife. In fact, she's not. I should've get married, she said she's pregnant, but I couldn't get leave. And if I get one, how should I go home, someone will kill me on the road. Is your mother old? - Of course. You know how are village women, when they gave birth, they're already old. She's alone, widow. It's not easy for her. And how's your cow. - Great, busa! Busa? In fact, she was great, you won't believe me mate, she was giving 18 liters. - Get out! - But back then we had horses, two pairs of oxes. Now it all came down to those three. Cow is pulling the cart, plow... Cow, and those two women. Your wife is pretty. What's the use, even if I come back alive, I'll find an old woman. You leave a child, a girl, and you find an old woman. Who knows how long it'll last. Do you have matches? - Sure, I'll find some. You're a partisan, damn you! What is that? Who shot earlier? - Politician. If I hadn't, you'd be lying here instead of your ustasha friend. What ustasha? He has a wife, has a cow, he's a villager, like me, like all of us. Man learn things until death. You don't talk with enemy anymore. As soon as you do, he becomes a kin. Almost like brothers! From now on, only 'Death to fascism, freedom to the people' Dikan, three of us are wounded. Mouse is serious, Nikola is dead. Where's Mouse? - Down there. It went good how it could've been. What's with you? What are you holding there? - Nothing. - Let me see! You're wounded, you're bleeding. Since I was in high school, I was dreaming of the first days of revolution. Well, I'll die the first day like a lousy Home Guard soldier officer. Come on mate, what do you mean die? Listen, One of our friend was cut open with a bayonet by ustashas, and he brought his gut in his hands, like a bundle of plums, and he's still alive! - From what book are you, you villager... Hold on mate, just a little more. Hold on, you can't die just like that in partisans. Ican, Ican! Markeza, get me the cart! Hold on mate, you'll still suffer from our partisan life! Do you understand? Ican, get me the cart! Hold on mate. We were very lucky, Markeza. Very. Very lucky. This bloodshed. Mile, load that in! What are you doing here? Where's your accordion? - To hell with her! Mister... I hope it didn't brake. It didn't, it works. Come on, get up. Throw that away. You scared me, damn you! Dikan, six prisoners. I don't know what to do with them but... - Alright. It's my fault. - Certainly not. Only bad things is that things look different in books. Come on, come on, faster! Go. Kill us, you damn communists! I avenged my self long time ago! - On innocent children, you slaughter! I'm only sorry for not killing more of you! One day, when they capture you, we'll be in prisons and camps. You know what happened to Amod's wife and child. - Calm down. If anything happens to you I'll kill the child and myself! Come on comrade, hurry up with that loading. Burn this trucks here. Markeza! What do we have there?? It's about 80 rifles, and 4 machine guns. Should I load everything. - Of course. And what is this? - A cannon, comrade commandant. But he's sick. - What? - He's sick, poor man is blind. Wait, are we talking about a cannon? - Of course, what else? It's blind, it doesn't have sights, but it's mobile, real pleasure. So it's no good? - Not exactly no good, it's good for a close fight. - That's what's knife for! Destroy it. Come on comrades, move out! - You'd better told me to cut my arm. Change your hats! We're people's army again. Hurry up, what's going on? Accordion player, in the front! Come on comrades, we're not grannies, we're army! What's this? Look at him, go in the front! Why are you glued to me? Farewell. Farewell. War is cruel, damn it! If anything happens to him, I killed him. I wanted to tell you something. That fighter that shot those ustashas. - I know, I know. I see that too, I'm not blind. But Ivan, no war can be won without these people. Besides, he's not a fighter, he's a platoon commander. That too. If he's a sergeant, why doesn't he wears a stripe? A bit more order wouldn't be too bad. - Alright, I'll put a stripe too. We did plenty of things today. Ican, burn that! Ustashas won't come back here. For sure. What are we waiting here? - This mister captain here. Remember, because of him Lazo killed that guard. Did you see that scum? He ran away from us, we shot a man, and he's back in occupant service. How is he in Home Guard soldiers? - I'll ask him tonight! - Dikan! Shouldn't we wait for dark? - I'm not waiting for dark, I'm waiting a captain. Go around them on the right. - Alright. Scums are playing army. - What are they doing here? They're cutting trees. It's about 300 of them, all of them are Serbs. From Srem, Slavonija and Banija. Cowards, they think they'll save themselves and the land. Come on, move. Let's go. Get up! Faster! Stop! - I stopped! - Who's going? - Partisans! Who? - Partisans. - Partisans! Surrender, Home Guard soldiers! Come on, get out of the tent, and stand in line over there. Get in line. Who tries to escape will be killed! Faster! If someone shoots, you'll all die. Come on! Ican, take them across. Come on. Faster! Come on! Come on, faster. Faster! Listen up now, this goes for everyone. If anyone is hiding weapons, he will be shot. How many of you is here? About 150. - What weapons do you have? French three meter guns, Manlicher. - That's garbage, throw the guns, burn ammunition with the tents. What are you shaking for? Put your hands down, Tie him up. - But I didn't resist. That's a shame, you'd be dead now. - I'm protesting, I'm an officer! Take him. Come on, move! Since we're in war, or since they forced me into this rumble, I saw all kind of scums. Criminals, burners, cowards, and all kind of evil. But you're the worst! They burned your villages, killed your children, and you're still serving them! Only cattle can be a servant to his torturer, not a man! Not a man! Do you understand me? Who want's to join, step forward. Is that all? Why you don't want to? And you? - You know my reasons. I'm a villager, and that's it. And I don't belong to anyone. And everyone can step on me, you do it to if you want. Are you nothing too? No! If I join you, they'll kill and burn everything. And if you have mercy, bring back that one over there. He's from my village, and it's told for each one that deserts, they'll kill at least 10 people. Understand that we're Serbs. - Your dead lie on this land. Your children are being born! You soaked this land with your sweat and taking good from it! We won't beg anyone here, do you understand me? Strip them in their underwear and send them home! I don't want to look at them! And listen now, If we see each other again, I don't know how we will departure! Take that of! And go home to your wives, under their skirts! Really shitty army. Your Dikan will give you a gun. Mister... - What mister? To hell with mister, when will you become a partisan? Come on, play that yours, ours and theirs. Come on, take that of. Mister... Nikola, my dear Nikola, did you need all this? I did woman, of course I did. One, two, three, four, five, six. This is the sixth time that you're asking me same question and I give same answer. Now we had a conversation, now leave me alone for a while. Don't talk like that. - Good evening. - Hello, politician! Good evening. Come in, sit down. How are you? - Excellent! It was nothing, just a little blood. Others scared me. I'm good again. - And where's... - They took your guy. They came from headquarters. He must be some important man. He said hello, and that he'll contact you if he survives. But to be honest, that's not likely. They brought this from headquarters, they say it's from Zagreb. I just have to look. When you receive this letter, all of my sufferings will be gone. It's hard for me for hurting you, and forgive me darling, for not having more courage, Calm down. Come back home. If anything happens to you, to you, I'll kill the child and myself! What is it? - Nothing. We'll bury him before we leave. Someone should stay with her tonight, I mean a woman. - She asked for a priest. A priest in partisans? - We'll bring three priest if she wants! Get out! Go, Ican. - I'm going. Markeza went, but priest is scared. - He's scared from you. - From me? From me? Come on Markeza, bring him here. If he refuses, beat the priest and the God inside him, but bring him. And you Ican, bring the prisoner in the headquarters. And hurry up! There Ivan, we have to finish that too. And let me tell you something, Let's not talk too much with him. No one will fool me again. When our people start talking, there's no more enemies. That's why I love Krauts, he doesn't understand me, I don't understand him, Gun against gun, and who survives. That's the enemy, well done. And our shits, like they are your own brothers. You're more guilty than that village cattle. Where's your officer pride and honor? You shame! We should stomp on you. It's a waste to spend a bullet on a scum like you. Please, give me a cigarette. They took mine. You did, if I'm not mistaken. Take it. Why are you letting a dead man to smoke? We don't own a tobacco factory. And we'll shoot you anyway. What are you looking at? Did you expect something else? You said you were first class captain? How did you not get a promotion? Just shake it on the floor. Young people. Enthusiastic, heroes... I was like that twenty years ago. - Answer our questions, do you hear me? I'm trying. You're a junior officer. - We don't have the time to answer your questions. I'm just trying to answer your questions. In my days, it was not easy to become an officer from a shepherd. Great courage was needed. - Do you think I'm a fool? Who are you trying to fool? Answer the questions, short and clear! - I was wounded four times. Every time in other combat. I was 24 year old back then. I was old like you are now. And now I could be your father! But you were serving your country, and now you're serving a torturer! You're saving yourself while others die. And it's all same to me! If you steel, or if you're holding a bag. - I couldn't prevent death of others. Who am I? Besides, you don't know what is to be scared for wife and children. And you can't judge me! - Enough! Enough, do you understand! I don't have anything more to do here. Soon, we'll be on trial here! Screw talking with a dead man. - Courier was here. The headquarters stayed here, and battalion has to get in action at once. Alright, fine. Gather up men, and move in the dawn. Right away. - Go. Mara! Hey, Mara! Come up for a while. Give me your hand, Mara. My Dikan! Damn it, this war is a trouble for Gods and for men. Wait a minute. Instead of lying on girls tits, I get stabbed on this belt! Come on, take this of. War will end before I undress you. Dikan, what will happen if anyone finds about us? What can happen? They'll cut your hair, they'll shoot me. Be quiet. How long do you have wife's photo? - Not for long. My wife is younger than me. Fifteen years. How many children do you have? - Two girls and a son. Oldest started school. I'm sorry, I smoke a lot. - Help yourself. You know, until I was 40 I was dealing with horses and recruits. I though there's nothing else on the world besides horses and recruits. I was not unhappy with that life. Then you discover that there's much more value in life. So man suddenly gets to know himself. If you'd join the partisans we'd have an excellent officer. And you did the worst thing. - What ever I'd do, they'd kill my children. There's many Serbs in this village. People have suffered very much here. To them, you're even more guilty. - I know about sufferings, but tell me, is it my fault that I had the fortune to save my family and myself? I don't get it how did they accept Serb for an officer. My wife is Croat. So it's mixed marriage. Change to a Catholic religion. I didn't change my religion. I was working in military region. I had some Croat friends. And now it's my fault for their honesty and not giving me to ustashas or Germans! You couldn't be saved by people that were not on ustasha's authority. I wonder what did you do for them? - Do what ever you want, but don't insult me and humiliate me. I'm asking in the name of my four wounds. You won't touch me. You got stripes for your wounds. You deserved that, and for this you'll also get what you deserve. Ican, take him out! Why are you mentioning those four wounds all the time? I don't know if he's just a coward, or a villain too? Coward like this would betray his own father to save his life. Come on Ivan, we should shoot him right away. We can make that decision just like that. - We have to go. Courier has arrived, he said that headquarters must go across Sava, with ferry, and we have to secure them. And he's dead anyway, we're just torturing him. - Listen, Dikan... Alright, I know, Ivan. I'll tell Ican to bring him. But let's finish that until morning. What ever I've done, they'd kill my children. I wont give my children. And you kill me, I'll save them like that too. It's not just your children in danger. The whole country is burning. But people are fighting for their fatherland. - What fatherland? I was already bleeding for the fatherland, for the king and the fatherland. And where's my king? In London. And you're telling me, after 20 years, that my king isn't real king! And that that fatherland that I fought for is not real fatherland! That I should give my life for a new king and a new fatherland. I'm not giving children to the God, to the king or fatherland! And you kill me! But I'm not giving my children! Ican. I want to read you something. Our dear father, You can't imagine our happiness when the postman brought us your letter. We're scared for you all the time and we just wait that this cursed and terrible war ends so you can come back home. Come back, that's all we're asking for. We have everything we need, except you, and I can rest the children. Seka started school and she's studding good. And Gvozden has learned letters with her, and to count to 100. What? What are you looking at? You think I don't understand her? There's ten women like that in the village. Widows of our fighters. They don't know how to write, and they don't have anyone to write to. But I know what's in there. That's the way it is pal. What can you do? And let me tell you something else. When ever we captured Croat home defenders I let you to do what ever you want? Is that fair? But a Serb, who's serving a killer of Serbian children, you'll give him to me. Lie down, Ivan. It's almost dawn. Come on, lie down. I didn't ask you. Are you from this village? No. Village name was Vorica. It's burned to the ashes. And he's talking about four wounds. Your youth and your family you dedicated to our freedom. War is showing it's terrible face every day. In these difficult times, no one lived or died better than you. You will be in our memories forever. May this soil, that you loved more than your life, be easy for you. And more than your youth. Now please, hurry up. Just to tell you something You think you're the only one who has children? You think that a dog gave birth to my children? You have children? I had two sons. Like two pieces of cheese. Like two golden coins. On winter, when wolves howled around the house, they use to say: 'We don't need wolves, we have our dad.' And I was... looking how they're taking them, two hundred meters away. They called: 'Dad! Hey, dad!' They killed them on my sight. I had to stay quiet in the shelter, because twenty wounded men were hidden there, If I'd went to save the children, they'd kill the wounded. Until now there's 30 orphan in this village! And I swore, that I'll... kill everyone who's responsible! I said we need a cannon for this, they'll kill us like cattle! Forget about a cannon, let's try to draw them of the fairy. Leave the dead, save the survivors! Hold on, Markeza! - Why are you here? Get back, now! Take cover! Faster, faster! - Comrades, don't show yourselves! Take cover! - Bring the carriers! Faster! Take cover over there! Down with bloody Hitler! Down with Ante Pavelic! To hell with these enemies. They could've swear back at least once. It's taking too long huh? Eight dead. We didn't have that for a long time. If we don't do anything in an hour, we can withdraw. - I'll write a letter. I'll ask them to surrender and guarantee for their lives. Will you sign? You sign it and send a prisoner to deliver it. Come here you cowards! Strange Home Guard soldiers. They're quiet, and they're fighting like best Krauts. Those are spraying bullets. Can you hear them in the air? When that hit you it makes a whole like a child's head. Those aren't spraying bullets. Bullet is going trough airless space, and cracks. It's spraying bullets. He thinks he knows everything because he was a caplar. Look with what am I shooting. If I have a cannon, we'd see who is who here! Shall we try again? - I think people lost their courage. Let's wait for the cannon. If we wait that blind cannon we won't go across the river today. To hell with your Ante Pavelic! Down with bloody Hitler! To hell with that whore of yours! There goes the letter. Ican, prepare the men for charge. Jura, play our song. - Now? Of course, to scare them a bit. We didn't fought in war like this yet. What's this? I'm asking what's this? - Real nice, our people like songs. Enough. Stop it! They're mocking us! - No way. I know the boys, they're joking. They're joking? Dikan! Dikan, the cannon is coming! Come on comrades, hurry up! Who are you? - A teacher, I live in school. - Who's there? Some gendarmes and Home Guard soldiers. - How many gendarmes? About 8, but more than 100 home defenders. - Listen to this. 'We're refusing your demands for surrender with the greatest hate, we're expecting big help. Here are home defenders that don't surrender. Come, we're waiting for you.' Who signed that? - The prisoner. Ustasha? - No but he's a fool, he's trying to impress two teachers, thinks he's Napoleon. Fool. - Stand over there. If I ever catch him, I'll kill him. Eight dead because of one fool. Did you really think they'll surrender? Come on man, who took this position with a letter? Now you'll be everywhere. Move, Mouse. Markeza, is that ready? That's weak, Markeza. - Weak? They're scared shitless. Listen Ican, I'll take 5 volunteers to the bout, I'll sneak near the bunkers, and you make a false charge on the faery. You're with me, huh? But I can't swim. - Me neither. You don't need that, you're not a fish. Come on. Tell me, where's that airless space? Markeza, how many grenades do we have? - About 10. - Exactly 15. When you see us on the other side, shoot the last 10, after 10th we're going into the bunker. Understand? - Yes. - Bye, Markeza. Good luck. - Alright. Come on, comrades! What should I do with another 5? - Shoot them now! Shoot it, Mouse. Airless space is in the air, you fool! There's Dikan. The last 10. - First one. Ivan, the first! Three. I'll go to the first bunker, you go on the second one. Mouse, man, you're ignorant. We're going! Eight! Mara! Nine. Come on. Surrender, Home Guard soldiers. You signed this? - Yes, yes. Do you know we had 8 dead, you even more? - Boys, war is war, it's not a soccer match. Oh Jura, comrade partisan! How are you? - Hello Stef. I don't fell like joking. There were plenty of dead today, all good men. How's it going. - Ah, that's all for people. How are things at home? - It's fine, they're living... Say hello to them. - Bye Stef. - Come one! Take care Jura! - You're guilty for the dead on both sides! Whatever, I was just doing my duty. - Why didn't you surrender when you received a letter. - What kind of officer I'd be if I surrender on any letter? Besides, you won, well done, but I demand a treatment that I deserve. You'll get one. Take him against the wall! - Let's go. Let's go! - Let me go! I didn't start the war! Or I'm here voulonteerly. I got this uniform, invitation to this unit, dirty fairy. Listen mister, you joined the war voulonteerly, right? You're a communist, man with big views. Do you understand, I'm just a newbie here. - Move over there! What's wrong with you? Leave me alone! - Come on! I don't have three heads, just one! They forced me to come here! I have nothing to do with that, do you understand? Listen, I don't... Boys! Men, I'm not guilty... Come on faster! Get in line! None wounded or dead will be left behind. Load them in the cart and send them home. - They're on the way home. Alright. - I know it's not your fault, but you could've realized today, that being Home Guard soldier is not harmless. Many of your men has lost their lives today, serving occupant and his servants. Betrayers of our people! You can't say anymore that this war is none of your business. There's no one in this country anymore, who's out of this war. Who wants to join us, come in front of the line. Home Guard soldier, shame on you! Are you a man? - Cut the crap! I brought four guns for the partisans. Did you use any of them? You Home Guard soldier scum! Dikan, there's an army on the road with motorcycles and tanks. It's headquarters. - No, it's Germans and ustashas, about 500. Now what? Hell, we can only run. Come on Ican, you hurry up with wounded men. Ivan, come here. Come on comrade, retreat. - What is it? We have to run, understand? We'll stay behind for a while, to give wounded men some time, Gang won't go to the woods at once. Hurry up. Jura? Retreat towards fairy and tell the others. Hurry up. Come on, retreat. Hurry up. What do you say know airless space my ass! - What spraying bullets, bullet is cutting trough the lieves and branches and cracks, Mouse, you fool! Listen kid, I had enough of you! Who are you calling Mouse? I could carry you in my teeth! Grab that and get on the front! - Alright, comrade Nikola. Get of the fairy. Will you leave your head here, damn it? Legs are always saving our crazy head. If I survive this war, I'll put pillow under my feet, not under my head. Oh, God bless you, it started! Dikan! Will you make it? - Ah, it's nothing. Our comrade, was captured by the gang, you understand, they cut him open, and he brought his guts in his hands, like a bundle of plums!
