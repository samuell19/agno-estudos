(exotic tribal music) - Jeez, Bobby, you got the gang by the throat There's your mrs. with lunch (laughing) - Excuse me, which one of you is Bobby Wilson? - Here, you're wasting your time with them mister - I'm Bob Wilson - You were recommended to us by Norm Lockwood Mr. Lockwood of Native Affairs Well, the situation is, that we've been searching high and low for an aboriginal boy to play a role - A leading role I may say, in a very important film which Mr. Chauvel and I are making - What do you want me to do? - I suppose you could say, it's something like a corroboree You act out a story and we take your picture A moving picture that is - You mean like Hopalong Cassidy? (laughing) - Exactly - He seen every Hopalong Cassidy picture about 10 times - We're going to make something rather better than that But first we have to give you a test - Okay, turn over - [Crewman] Speed - Now, Bobby, concentrate You are Marbuck, a proud savage warrior Now let me see it, Bobby, let me see that pride Right, now walk in a slow circle Yes Yes, think how Marbuck the warrior would carry his body Strong, upright You are tribal, you know only the trees the rocks, and the rivers You've come in from the wild to the capital section And there are many nervous come out to watch you You can feel them looking at you But You are a killer You're a fugitive from the law and there's the light of the devil in your eyes (laughing) Cut Fabian, show one Peggy, Peggy, Peggy, come on You come here and stand beside Bobby - No, I can't act - [Elsa] It's not a test dear, it's just to help - There, come on, no need to be nervous There we are, there's a good girl Now you just kneel down there There Now For the moment, you are Jedda An innocent, young, pretty girl, who's been brought up by the white station owners In other words, someone who is caught between two worlds You're attracted, mightily attracted, to this handsome stranger - Okay, turn over, speed - Now you Bobby, you have a powerful magic and you weave a kind of spell over this girl You sing her to you (tribal singing) Cut - Something like that? - Australian Aboriginal history falls into two parts 18,000 years before and 150 years after white colonial imperialism In other words, centuries of harmony and coexistence with this harsh, but fragile landscape From then, if a smug, white complacency would only admit it, A brief, agonized era of despair This tradition of passive acceptance may soon be changing Here at Wave Hill Station in the Northern Territory, Aboriginal stockmen of the Guerengi tribe are on strike On strike for equal pay with their white counterparts As though, black stockmen daring to strike is not enough in itself, the strikers are gaining strong support from other black spokesmen Among these, is perhaps Australia's best-known aborigine, longtime film and television star Robert Tudawali - Okay, that's enough Harry, does it have to be imperialism? White colonial imperialism? It's biased, it's not objective - Since when have we been objective? - This is not journalism, this is something personal Griping - I would have thought there was plenty to gripe about about these days - Did you hear? He's had an accident You might have to update this with a bit of voice over If it really gets bad, you can always whiz up there and get some extra footage - I just whizzed down from there, I'm not going Richard - Harry, now for God sake, you know the guy, you just interviewed him, who else can I send? - No thanks - Harry Okay, what's bugging you? - The man's a mess, and what he could-- - Newsroom: Tudawali, he's worse - And? - Could go either way - I say that's a long way to come just to visit someone in hospital - Well it's partly professional, he also happens to be a friend Oh, you got some mates up here have you? Best little spot on earth, Darwin You can have Sydney, I've been there once Up here in the territory, people are real friendly you know what I mean? Who's your mate, I might know him? - It's possible you do Tudawali, Robert Tudawali - Bloody Bobby Wilson Yeah, I know him alright He's the bastard that's been stirring up trouble with them abo stockmen - He didn't start any trouble he just came in as a sort of spokesman - But there's no real difference between the way we treat the white stockman and the Aborigine - You forget that we do have considerable experience with the native labor - They get the same wages, the same conditions, the same - Same? Mr. Conroy, as representative of your English company, How do you react to claims that your managers are paying white Stockman $50, yet their black counterparts get only $10? - Well, that's untrue, completely untrue They get part cash, but they also get part credit at the company store You must realize that one native may have 15 relatives and we feed them all - I hope you realize Bobby Wilson is a very sick man He's hardly surfaced yet - How bad is he? - This may disappoint you, but he has a fighting chance Well, bad news is good news for journalists isn't it? - Well, this may disappoint you, sister, but we've been friends for a long time - Well if he comes around while you're with him call for me immediately Don't start asking him questions Don't upset or disturb him Who gave you permission to go into this patient's room? - Visitors might get him over-excited sister I don't think he should be talking to anybody until he's talked to us - Well, what do you want with him? It was an accident wasn't it? How did it happen? - We're not sure It was night before the show The Darwin Agricultural Show There was a lot of celebrating and drinking at the Bagot Reserve There was sort of fight, some sort of argument - Fight? What about? Why would he? Surely he didn't just lie there in the fire - The alcohol level in his blood was very high - Didn't anyone try to help him? - He was almost gone before we were called Of course, it may have been a stroke He has a long history of TB too I don't think there's much point Mr. Wilkins, but if you want to stay a while - Yeah, thanks - Ladies and gentlemen of the press, to play the part of the arch villain, in the role of Marbuck, Mr. Robert Tudawali (people applauding) Robert is a member of the Tiwi tribe He was born on Melville Island, we think some 25 years ago At the age of 10, his father moved the family from Melville to Darwin This little native boy paddled the 50 miles of open water between the island and the mainland alone in his own canoe Now as you can see in his early years, he was a crocodile and a buffalo hunter But then he took up an even more dangerous sport, Aussie rules football (laughing) Now Robert is an actor Both Robert and Rose took to their new profession with amazing ease And we spent eight months filming in some quite spectacular locations And we're going to spend the next three months here in Sydney in the studio Now, if there are any questions, I'd be delighted Well, we'd all be delighted to answer them - Miss Kunoth and Mr. Tudawali, What's it like being Australia's first aboriginal film stars? - I like acting in films - What did you do before Mr. Chauvel put you in his film? - I worked for Mr. Wilson down at the Ref Base Did a bit of laboring, whatever job I could get - I hope Mr. Chauvel's paying better money for this (laughing) - So do I, otherwise I'll have to get this flash suit back - 70% of Robert's salary is paid into a trust fund for Bob and his family The rest is finger money to do with as he chooses - Out of all the big city has to offer, Mr. Tudawali, would you know what to spend your money on? - My wife asked me to bring her back some nice dresses and a record player - Mr. Tudawali, your wife Peggy, why didn't she accompany you? - She hasn't been too well lately - Tell me, Mr. Tudawali, what does roscoeana taste like? - You tell me Miss, what does roast lamb taste like? (laughing) - You did very well in there, you're really professional - Thanks - I'm sorry about your wife being sick, I didn't mean to put you on the spot - That's okay - It's nothing serious I hope - TB - Oh, hell, I'm sorry - She in hospital? - Mmm - How long? - Doctor reckoned she'd be in for about a month - First time in Sydney? - Yeah Big place Terrific - Well, if ever you need a coach tour, I mean a look around, I'd be only too happy to show you the sights. This is my newspaper number and this is my home number - Hey, you better tell me who you are - Harry Wilkins - Is your wife from Melville Island too? - No, she's Wogait, from Delissaville About 50 miles from Darwin They got a big mission school there - Did you go to school Robert? - Not for long though Peggy, she can read and write better than me She's always reading books - But you speak English very well Want some more corned beef? - No, thank you - Why'd you leave school? - My sister died at school - Oh, I'm sorry What did she die of? - Don't know for sure A lot of kids got sick at school My father reckoned school killed her (laughing) - I know what he meant-- - Harry! - Do you and your wife have any children? - Not yet But when... When I do I want the best Well, I mean, the best I can do for them - Come on Come on You're all wet (laughing) - Cut Cut, cut - Sorry, you're not a common sight in a Sydney pub - Not a common sight in a Darwin pub either Not too many of us got the right to drink up there - Why? - Welfare Act All black fellas were registered made wards of the government Not allowed to drink, vote, and we got to be in at a certain hour each night - Jeez - To protect us from ourselves Me, I'm privileged My name's not on the stud book - My bloody cues bent Thought I was supposed to be teaching you? - What are you looking at Snow White? Come on mate, you're not playing for a ship station - We've got another game yet, goes to three - Not in this pub mate, against the house rules Now... Take your money and move out sport - It's my money, put it back - No one's talking to you Snow White - Look you heard what he said, put it back - Hey mate, you are that filmmaker bloke, aren't you? Tiddly Widdly - Tudawali - Yes, that's what I said Can I buy you a drink, never bought a drink for a filmmaker before You are going to give him his money back Give him his money - You have to try and get more than one feeling into the scene, Robert You fight against the death chant of your elders You think you can fight it You think you are stronger than they But the madness is eating into your mind Your will... We have to see this, this, this desperation This madness - That's pretty good Mrs. Chauv - Thank you Robert, I was an actress you know That's how I met Mr. Chauvel, in silent films - Well, ready? Now remember Robert, get in a deep breath It's all in the breathing If an actor has control of his breathing, he can control anything he has to do or say Got it? - Back on set, please! - Got it - Good boy - And mad, a little bit mad - Alright, Graham, we'll try one - Okay everybody, standing by Turn over Set slide 784, take one - Action! - Our men Belong tribe They point a bone at me They see me dead I die soon Mondinka say you're wrong skin for me If you die Mondinka happy Maybe not seeing me die If you die That's good - No, you mad fella!

You've been with her - I didn't! It was acting, acting for the picture - Oh, I'm sick of that picture I never want to see, everything's gone wrong since that lousy picture - Peggy, that picture was the first decent thing that ever happened in our lives (coughing) - Good evening ladies and gentleman and welcome on this most auspicious occasion First film premiere ever to be held in Darwin And coming now, I see the film's producer, the emulant Mr. Charles Chauvel Good evening sir - I'd like to take this opportunity of thanking the people of the Northern Territory who gave us so much help in the making of Jedda I hope you like the picture - I'm sure we shall, that was Mr. Charles Chauvel, Australia's most eminent film producer / director Tonight we are here to preview Jedda, Australia's very first ever-- - Elsa, where's Bobby? - Hello, Jacko - You fellas just got back in time The boss killed a fat bullet this morning Plenty of good tackle for everyone tonight - Hello Billy, how's your big conilly?

Jedda, Jedda She no good for you, it's your own skin Listen Marbuck, listen - [Male voice] Look out Joe! (screaming) - [Voiceover] Was it alright to expect that Jedda one of a race so mystic and so removed should be of us in one short lifetime? The tireless whisper of the soul of Jedda now flies on the lonely plains and mountain cranes with the wild geese And that she is happy with the great mother of the world in the dreaming time of tomorrow - Come on Rosa, stand up, take a bow Where's Robert, Elsa, where's Bobby? For god sakes Bob, where have you been? - Right down here where I always sit - Thank you, thank you Here he is, a young man with the whole world before him (speaking native language) - Hey Hey! Hey!

Were you there? - You're Harry aren't you? - All you want is a story - What was the fight about? Look, you could help me I don't know enough The man may die All I need to know is how and why it happened (coughing) - I got it too Peg - It's my fault, come out of hospital too soon You got it from me - Get it anyway Living in this dump Half the people on the reserve got it As long as you two are alright - You don't deserve this Bobby - It's my money Mr. Everett - Which is supposed to be a weekly allowance Not given out in great dollops whenever you feel like it - Gotta pay people I gotta keep up paying for my bike - 1,800 quid Is that true? Are you going down south? It's a bloody fortune, even for a white man Bobby - I did alright - You can buy me a fair few cowboy suits with 1,800 quid You're a soft-touch that's your trouble I'll never understand you - I'm gonna cry - What? - The allowance from your generous friends down south is monthly Any extra and you need an application form But if you're going to share it around the way some do - My wife's pregnant, she's still sick in the chest I gotta get some medicine and stuff for her - Just so long as you do - You don't look that good yourself - I'm alright - [Female voice] It's a beautiful baby - [Female voice] Oh, thank you very much - Your relatives didn't earn that money they haven't any right to it - We do it different, anyway, that's my problem ain't it? - No, this is your problem, a sick wife and a new baby - Bobby's a good boy Mr. Chauv - I think he wants to be Peggy You really spent every penny that we put aside for you? - I could not hold it in just my pocket There was too much Mr. Chauv Thanks for coming - Well, with headlines like these racked with TB, living in slums I got here as soon as I could manage We've only been back a week - I heard they liked the film overseas - Oh yes, yes, it got some favorable comment - You gonna be making any more pictures down south? - I don't know Robert I think Australian audiences are more interested in Americans than they are in their own country - I'd like to act again - You should Robert, you have an extraordinary gift - Chips Rafferty is trying to get some money together to make a film He wanted me to act in it, but I said no - Why on Earth not? - Mr. Chauv, you know I... - She's very pretty Peggy, what are you going to call her? - Christine Joyce Jedda - How nice Thank you (speaking native language) - You gonna miss me?

Someday I'm going to take you with me To Sydney Maybe we'll live down there forever Funny - What? - I was thinking about that time when I was a kid when I paddled that canoe from Melville Island 50 miles 50 miles of open water I was excited Real adventure But I was scared too - What of sharks? - Sharks? Nah, that's my dream That's why Mr. Chauv used the name Tudawali That's Tiwi for shark No, I was scared of where I was headed - I know what you mean I don't know Sometimes I hate this bloody country This... Smug self-satisfied country - You don't mean that, do you Harry? This is the best little spot on earth mate - Yeah, but I don't feel at home here Wish I did Your people, you've got something Something we've lost If we ever had it You feel at home here, you're comfortable You got a... A spirituality that's closer to the land A center inside you A stillness I envy your people I envy you - That's a heap of shit Harry (laughing) - Where's Bobby? - What do you want Mr. Harper? - Got any money on you Peggy? - No - That's a pity Peggy Because Bobby still owns me 85 quid - It's not my bike, you talk to him - That bike's been back in my shop four times and he hasn't paid me a penny You just tell him that - I'll tell him - Unless you and I can come to an arrangement - I'll tell him when he gets back He's too busy being a film star - Film star my ass Once a bum always a bum - Hey Jimmy! Jimmy boy, how are you? Look what I got for Christine - Hey Marbuck, how are you? Merry Christmas - Merry Christmas, hey, I got a little present for us too Five minute tea break You know Christmas drink eh? - Hey you down there, be quiet Hey, put a sock in it douche Use what you got, shut up - Another deep breath then say anything Well that's nice, bringing a kid into a place like this - I asked him to - Who's the genius who had him arrested? - Bobby was supplying liquor to a ward of the state - Come off it Jack, six months Having a Christmas drink with his cousin - He does not have citizenship - Have you any idea what goes on in the real world outside your office? Look, half the country's in an uproar about it This is the way we are seen to celebrate Christmas in this outpost of civilization Look, it is less than a year since Namagiri got six months for exactly the same offense Don't we ever learn? I want him out of here - And Charlie you know he's not under your jurisdiction? - The health of these people is my jurisdiction This man has TB, he should be in hospital - It doesn't matter - Oh, doesn't it? You get yourself locked up Peggy goes off, Christ, any knows where And your kid comes to me to put food into her mouth and it doesn't matter - I want him out of here today - Where have you been? - Away - For six weeks? - Anyway, I didn't wanna take Christine in there - No, you let Everett bring her - Why you always running off to Delissaville? Who you got there? - It's my home isn't it? And why shouldn't I? You run around and do what you like You're supposed to look after us - I'm afraid I agree with Peggy I don't think it's a good idea - Best idea anyone's had since Jedda - Bob you've been away months neglecting Christine and Peggy with another baby on the way I'm not sure your own health isn't up to it anyway And all for some tin pot television series - Tin pot? Up here, that's what's tin pot - You gotta have haven't you? All the fuss, all the fame, it's not worth a brass razoo Bob These Whiplash people will use you up And when it's all over you got to come back here try to settle down again, be just as restless as you have been since that damn Jedda - You welfare people, you're so bloody sure of what's good for me Sitting on my ass doing nothing - You could get a proper job - There are no proper jobs for us Sweeping streets, digging roads, shoveling shit, black fella's job My proper job is down there, I'm an actor - What if you got sick? - So Sydney hasn't got any hospitals? - We know your case here - We know your case, when I go to hospital up here Do you know when I get? Whites get four pound a week TB allowance, mixed bloods the same, and what do I get? I'm full bloody black fella, so I could have TB from asshole to breakfast time and I get nothing, bloody nothing! - Let him go - Mr. Chauv... He taught me a lot - Mr. Chauvel was very fond of you Robert I had such a lovely letter from Rose And a photograph Doesn't she look lovely? - She's a nun - I noticed She looks so dignified Don't you think? And you're making a television series It's all starting to happen now Too late for us Goodbye Robert - Whiplash Robert it's crap Shouldn't be wasting your time and talent on stuff like that - No other acting jobs around I thought once I was in Sydney, well.. Yeah, but when this finishes - I should talk I get myself into television journalism Exciting new medium, blah, blah, blah And what am I doing? Prize-winning marrows at the Sydney Agricultural Show While some yank who's got a 20-foot shack... - What do you really wanna do? - Something worthwhile Tell the truth, right some wrongs Tell people what it's really like, I don't know What about you? - Just make it good, better, for the kid My dream the shark, believes when the strongest dreaming of all The shark is feared by everyone in the sea He's a loner There's only one other dreaming that's, well... not as strong But not scared of That's the sea dog Porpoise Well they like each other And they're very careful of each other too But there's one way the shark can get the porpoise If he takes him out away from his friends into deeper water Do you wanna swim?

Maybe the best thing is to send you back to Melville Island for a while to cool off - I haven't been on Melville since I was a kid I wouldn't know how to talk to them even - It's a settlement for God sake, it's not a jail - Might as well be - Well, you're being warned (screaming) - I might have been inclined to make allowances, but for the testimony of your wife She's pleaded with this court to be protected from your disgraceful behavior You shown yourself to be quite incapable of managing your own affairs You have anything to say before I proceed with sentencing?

A freakin' witch doctor (laughing) - Robert, oh, hell Sister! Sister! - You must go now He won't wake before dawn I'm sorry about before I had no right to blame you for what happened - Please, that's not necessary Can I walk you somewhere? - No, I'm fine Goodnight Mr. Wilkins Robert did speak In the ambulance on the way in He said that it was three against one That they threw him onto the fire He was in a lot of pain Mr. Wilkins He may have been delirious - Mr. Wilkins, a few black men got drunk had a fight, one of them landed in the campfire I've seen it a dozen times - No, no, that's... That's too convenient Tudawali is becoming a thorn in the side of authority Caught up with black activists coming out in support of the first big black strike Somebody wanted him out of the way It's a classic situation every time the Aboriginal people get a leader the whites remove him with alcohol or money - You got it all worked out haven't you? - Alright, you tell me how it happened then - I don't know and I don't know who does Look, I hold no beef with Bobby Wilson I always thought he was a cheeky bastard There's been friction for a long time from both whites and blacks A lot of people were jealous of the kind of opportunities he got All that film star rubbish - Getting patted on the head like a trained seal Filling his head with white notions of individualism and self-importance - Did you hear the one about the black fella who found a genie in a bottle? The genie said you got two wishes master So the black fella thinks for a moment Then he says I wanna be a movie star and rich and famous So the genie goes poof and turns him into Clark Gable Then he has his second wish, he says I never want to work again for the rest of my life Just wanna lie around in the sun, do whatever I feel like So the genie turned him back into a black fella - Tudawali Come on shark where are you? I need... I wanna do something for you I wanna tell people Make them understand Understand myself - As though anyone in white Australia would give a damn - They would if they knew - They don't want to know - Robert Robert It's alright mate Don't worry I'm gonna look after Christine for you Take her to Sydney to that school, remember? Robert! - You're gonna take her - I'll get the doctor - You're not gonna take her! - I just wanna help you mate - Ways to help... She my flesh My spirit What can you give her? - It's me, Harry - Come on, fight You fight me, fight me! Come on, fight me! You're not going take her! What do you want from me? What do you want! What do you want for me? - [Harry] The strikers are gaining strong support from other black spokesmen Among these, is perhaps Australia's best-known aborigine, longtime film and television star Robert Tudawali - What we want is what everyone wants The right to a decent life Respect (speaking native language) They say that It's not about more money People say I'm I'm privileged cause I was taken up by them film people That's not a privilege, I earned that That's all we want Not charity We want the right to make our own way in life Like everyone else Mistakes and all (native speaking music)
