Made from earth-friendly material, it's a win for your feet and the earth. So try on a pair. The opulent comfort will surprise you. Take care of your sole, and your soul will soar. Ah, thank you, Eden. Perhaps we should see how Mr. Grayson feels? You don't understand our product. I think I do. Well I think you don't. Our customers like that we're simple and ecologically responsible. You have it painted like it's some luxury bed for your feet. Well I thought comfort would be a key appeal given the steep price point. We won't be using this. Well, is there another angle you would prefer I try? That's all. Mr. Grayson? Let me just tell you we have a interesting team committed to doing the best for your company,. [clients chattering] [sighing] I researched, and researched, and ran surveys and everything, and Grayson is wrong. His customers are buying flip flops! They want something comfortable on their feet for cheap! Well I'm glad you didn't tell him this. Why? Don't we want our clients to succeed? We want them to be happy. And we want them to be our clients still. Did they fire us? No. No I convinced them to stay and to give us a second chance. Okay, well good. I'll give them what they think they want. I'm giving it to someone else. [solemn music] Oh. Look, Eden, you're bright and you're hard-working. But lately, something's off. You're not connecting with the clients, and it's like you lost your drive. You used to knock these pitches out of the park, with a passion to rival PT Barnum. Look, I can try harder. It's not that you don't work hard enough. Maybe you need a change. Are you firing me? No, no. I just... [sighing] I want you to take a break though. Take a week or two off, and recharge. Figure out what you need, and then come back fired up. Okay. What am I gonna do? Enjoy the time off. Sure, and conveniently ignore the fact that my job is on the line. He didn't say that, did he? Michael, when your boss says he doesn't like your work and orders you to take time off, none of that is good. You deserve a good vacation. Like I'll be able to enjoy it while I worry about my career. Take Michael with you. You could come with me. I wish I could. Things at work are crazy right now. Tax season is over. We've had a huge increase in filing extensions, for some reason this year too. I just can't take time off right now. Okay. Speaking of, I should get back to the office. Well make sure you get home at some point. I'll call it a night around 10. I'm sorry. Thanks for dinner. Sure. See you, Michael. Good night, Kate, bye honey. Night. Okay, you should go somewhere. I can keep an eye on things here, you know, grab your mail and all that. Right, you're great. Well what are good neighbors for? I don't even know where I would go. What about somewhere you can just clear your head? There is one place I can think of. Hey, are you busy next week? Other than hair appointments, no. We can get someone else to pick up the mail. Okay, where are we going? [chuckling] [bright music] I've never been to Lake Tahoe before. You'll love it. This is your family's summer home? Yeah, it was my grandparents' place and they willed it to my parents. We'd spend every summer here growing up. I loved it. My parents renovated it a couple of years ago. But no one lives here right now? Not year-round. I called my mom and she said we could come and dust it off. Feel free to call me to dust this place off anytime. I know. I barely recognize it. I don't think I've been here since before my freshman year in college. Wow, has it been that long? Do your parents come here often? Not as much as they used to. I think they rent it out here and there. [sighing] Hey, who's that? Uh... I don't know. No one else should be here. Excuse me, can I ask what, [light music] Riley? Eden. [laughing] It's great to see you. Yeah, you too. I wasn't expecting you here. I noticed there's a problem with one of the sprinkler lines and it wasn't getting enough water to the area so I thought I'd come over and see if I could fix it. That's nice of you, thanks. Hi, I'm Kate, Eden's friend. Hi, Riley. Oh, yeah. Riley's parents own the cabin next door so we would see each other every summer. So what brings you here? Well I needed a break. Kind of a forced vacation. The cabin was available so I went for it. What about you? You're living here? Dad got tired of the winters so he moved to Arizona. And I took over the cabin and started a business. That's great. What kind of business? Hot air balloons. You sell them? No, no. I do hot air balloon rides around here. Oh. That's certainly different. It's a work in progress. Well, I'll let you get settled. It was great to see you. Yeah you too. It's nice to meet you, Kate. Sorry about the, Oh, no, that's fine. Thank you for doing that. No problem. I'll just be a few more minutes here. Thanks. Yeah well I'll see you around. Yeah. Okay. Seeya. We need to get some groceries tomorrow. Sounds good. So Riley seems nice. Did you see him a lot here? I did. I don't even remember how we became friends. I think it was convenience. He was next door when we came here in the summer and became my default friend. Only a friend? Yeah, why do you ask? Just a vibe I got. That was years ago. He was the reason I looked forward to coming to Tahoe in my teenage years, but that's history. [phone ringing] Oh, it's Michael. Hi. Hey, did you and Kate make it all right? We did. Hi, Michael. Hi. So how is it? So far so good. Good! Hey, I hate to ask you so soon, but when do you think you're coming back? Ah, miss me already? I certainly do. [light music] Morning, Spencer. Hey. Yeah the valves on this are good to go. Minor adjustments but it's solid. Good, good, thanks. Any new reservations? No. No messages, anyway. All right. But we do have that one later this week, so, Yeah. Hey, things will get better. Of course. [gentle music] The water is gorgeous. Isn't it? Lucky you, coming here each year. I'm surprised you stayed away. It wasn't on purpose. Just work, life, you know. How are you feeling about work? Conflicted. How so? Part of me feels, what's the word? Annoyed that they're questioning my work. And the other part? I know it wasn't my best work. Lately, I care, but I don't enjoy it. I don't know, maybe I'm relieved. I thought you liked it there. I don't know. I didn't even really think about it until Reese benched me. Well it'll be fine when you get back, after you have had time to recharge. But it's not my decision. Reese seemed supportive about me coming back, but only if I'm back on my game. Ooh. It makes me appreciate what I do. Someone comes in, you cut their hair, done. Yeah, but you're good at it. And you're good at marketing. Am I? It's something that I chose when I was in college and I just went with it. Sometimes I wonder what else I could have tried. I don't know, maybe I'm just overthinking it. Why can't work just be work? Well it depends on what you want from it. You know, a simple paycheck or do you want some fulfillment? That's the real question, isn't it? [chuckling] Come on, let's go try the water. Okay. [light music] You don't have to have your life all figured out right now. It feels like I should have something figured out though, right? You have Michael. Yeah. Of course. But career is a big part too. Oh hey, there's this place you need to see around the corner. Mr. Webber's store, you'll love it. [door chiming] This was my favorite hangout spot in town. I'd always get the milkshake. That sounds really good right now. Yeah. Hello? Mr. Webber? There's a familiar face, Eden Clark! That's right. You're finally back. Well, just for a little bit. You know, I haven't seen much of your family for years. Not since your grandpa died. How are your parents? They're good. They don't make it out here much though anymore. And who's this? This is Kate. I'm showing her Tahoe, and I was just telling her that this was my favorite place. Well, thank you. It's a pleasure to meet you, Kate. You too. Go ahead and order something. Of course I know what she likes. Chocolate Brownie milkshake. That's because of the homemade brownies you put in it. Yeah. How about you, Kate? I'll try your cookie dough shake? Mmm. Ah, sensible choice. Why don't you go ahead and go in there and have a seat and I'll bring your order out. Okay. Okay. Thank you. Thanks. How much is this one? This one's 50. Mr. Webber's place was the hangout for all the kids. I think he associated me with my grandparents, it didn't matter that I was a summer visitor. He treated me like a local, like family. I like him. And his cookie dough wasn't bad either. I told you. Hey, is this too much for the two of us? Nah, it should be fine. But you know what we still need? What? Onions and peppers. Oh. Oh, over there. I'll grab some. Okay. [whimsical music] Finding everything you need? Mhmm, thanks. I thought you didn't like salad. Well, that's when I was 12. It's not so bad now. Ah, I see. You still love bananas? Allergic now. No! Yeah, it was a sad day when I had to give those up. Oh, I'm sorry. So what have you been up to? Today? Oh, let's see. I was just fixing up some stuff around the warehouse. Leaky pipe, flickering lights, that sort of thing. And then this afternoon was quiet business-wise. And so here I am stocking up my kitchen. I didn't know you were a fix-it type of guy. Oh yeah, just call me Mr. Do-It-Yourself. It helps keep costs down. You know I was surprised you're still living here. I'd have thought when you were old enough, you'd leave and conquer the world. In all fairness, I did leave and try a slice of life somewhere else but then I came back. Well, I'm happy to see you again. How long are you in town? Ah, a few weeks. It's a bit fluid. Right, so you'll relax, read a book, swim, shop. That all sounds perfect. Oh, and hiking! You know what you have to do while you're here? What? You gotta go to our spot. Our spot? The overlook. Oh. We should go together. You can show your friend too, I'm sure she'd love it. What do you think? Let's do it. So what's so special about this overlook? Well, we'd go there every summer. It was tradition. We, you and? Riley and me. Oh. So you'd just hike there? It's a really pretty hike. And? And... it's where we had our first kiss. Wait, what? We'd hike up here a couple times each summer you visited, didn't we? At least. The view must really be good. It depended on how noisy it got as Eden's mom and grandma argued. They always fought about who would cook each night, what they would make and how. Like your mom does when she visits you? Don't remind me. Hey, how much further? My feet are, well, I didn't really bring the best shoes for off-road activities. We're almost there. Okay. [gentle music] Eden, Kate, come on! Oh, wow. I need to get out more. How are your feet? Forgotten. Worth it? Just as I remembered. [uplifting music] So Kate, what do you do? I'm a hair stylist. That sounds fancy. I cut and style hair. It's really not. But hot air balloons sound amazing. That's what you do, right? Yeah. That must do well here. I mean, what a great view of the lake, right? You'd think, but it's been a bit of a slow start. You know it's a little pricey, so it's difficult for the casual or budget-minded tourist. But it's Tahoe! People come here to vacation and burn cash. Well, people come up here, hike like we did, and see the view. Maybe that's enough. You don't believe that, do you? It's a hot air balloon! It's unique. Yeah, well. I can only run tours early in the morning, or in the early evening if I'm lucky. So I'm starting to think maybe I should get another job to live on while I keep this as a side job. Well why don't you add more tours? Well the temperature affects how well we can rise. Then there's the wind, which picks up throughout the day. That's tricky. Yeah. It is fun though. You both should come see it for yourselves. You mean in the air? Yeah. That'd be fun. Job listing sites are just scary. Why are you looking at those? Just in case. But you weren't fired. Look at this one. This job description is a full page. I'm gonna need a special degree to understand what they're saying. Probably not for you then. What if I get fired? Then I have to go out there, find a job, interviewing, I hate all that. Okay, I thought you were supposed to be decompressing here, not stressing out about what-ifs. It's time to eat anyway. Well thanks. This looks good. Okay. Here you go. Thank you. Okay so what do you wanna do tomorrow? What do you want to do? There's this insanely over-priced spa. Maybe a massage? No thanks. Why not? It'd help you relax. Not really into those. But you should go ahead. Mmm, nah. I'll save that for another day. Oh, what about the hot air balloon thing? Riley did text me about a last minute tour tomorrow morning. He said there's room if we want to go. Want to? Yeah, that'd be fun. Okay. Cheers. [glasses clinking] [light music] [whirring] [fire whooshing] Looking good. Yep. Our group is late though. Even so, here comes the important part. You ready for this? I am, you? Ah, a little nervous. Welcome, good morning. You guys get up this early for every one of these tours? You two ready for this? I guess so. Where's the rest of the group? Good question. [phone ringing] Excuse me. Hello, Hot Air Tahoe? Hey. Oh, hey. I'm Spencer. I work for Riley. Hi, Eden. Kate. So what sort of fuel do you get for this to fly? Like a rocket fuel? Just propane. You're kidding. The stuff we use to grill? Yeah, the very same. Who would have thought? Okay. Okay, bye now. Well, some of their group are sick. So I rescheduled them for later in the week. Oh, come on. Well, maybe we can go another time. Yeah. Nonsense, we're all set up here. Let's hop in. So who flies this? I do. You? Don't you need a license? I got one. [eneretic music] You gonna open your eyes at all? How far off the ground are we? Why don't you take a look for yourself? Just give me a number. 25? Feet? More like yards but it's not that high. [gasping] You two okay? Sure. Speak for yourself. Just relax and enjoy the view. Is it safe up here? As long as I do what I'm supposed to. Are you? I haven't crashed anything yet. What about the wind? You said that the wind... Okay, okay. Are you trying to make me more nervous? I'm just curious. I checked the expected weather conditions and we're fine. Expected? Look how high we are! Yeah, it's great! You weren't kidding. Wait till you see the lake. Are you, like, steering us over there? I'm doing my best, yeah. You really know how to fly this. Yeah, let's hope so. I got my pilot's license. I was flying regional commuter jets. Really? You're surprised? Well you always said you wanted to fly, but we were kids. Things change. That's true. It got to the point where I never really felt like anywhere was home. I was always in the air and detached from mylife. I've been happiest here. What do you think? All those years coming here, I've never seen it like this. I have fond memories of this place, but this, this is the best. Well then you're gonna love this. Hey Kate, hang on. What? Are we falling? Oh wow. And this is the less impressive side of my little company. Here, I can help... Just set them down over there. How long have you been in business? Almost a year. What's your favorite part about it? Floating in the balloon, just above the lake's surface. I don't think there's anything more peaceful. It's pure serenity. What's the worst part about it? Making a living at it. I'll feel better once it takes off. No pun intended. You know, I could help with that. With what? I work in marketing. And it sounds like you need more customers. This experience is amazing. It should nearly sell itself if enough people try it out. But you're here on vacation. I could use an opportunity to sharpen up my skills. People can't even tell you're here. Most people just call, so I give them directions. But you're on Main street and there's lots of traffic. This building can be an advertisement. Sounds expensive. We don't have to do anything crazy, but this place can work for you. I still don't know if it'll make a difference. What have you done advertising-wise? You know, a poster here and there around town. And I have a website too. We can do more. If you'll let me help. You sure you want to get into this? I want to help you. All right. Sure. So much for relaxing. It almost pains me though. I can see he can do more and make his business succeed. How can I ignore that? I guess you really do like marketing. I just want him to succeed. Okay so how do you plan to help? Well, for starters he could use some more photos and video on his website. Especially of that view, and the balloon launching. Yes, okay, can you send that to me? I bet we can get some social media buzz going too with some simple ads. I know he's nervous about spending a lot but I know some easy stuff that will get the ball rolling. Yeah that's perfect. Are you sure? Yeah, yeah. Okay. Hot Air Tahoe. He definitely needs a sign for his warehouse. I don't know just a vibe with the sun and the sky. Is that going to be enough though? You know how you always see a gazillion tour brochures when you stay at a hotel? Guests look through those and plan out activities for their stay. We just need to get them to see Riley's Hot Air Tahoe. I so owe you. No you don't. Yes, I do. This is amazing. I'm glad you like it. You can still make changes. I didn't want to put in a big order until you saw it in real life. It's perfect. Let's print it. Great! And then let me take you out to dinner. Riley, you... No, I'm serious. A 'thank-you dinner' is the least I can do. Thank you. So you never told me why you were taking a break from work. Oh. That. Unless you don't want to talk about it. Oh. No, it's not horrible or anything, but my boss told me to take some time off so I can come back and be better at my job. Ouch. Sorry you asked? From what I've seen, you're great at your job. I used to be. I think that this was easier because the stakes were, more important, than say, selling sandals. Well hot air balloons are a lot cooler than sandals, so I get it. Do you like marketing? I thought I did. You told me that flying airplanes lost its appeal for you. I guess we all change. Maybe. You haven't changed as much as I would have thought. No? No. I still see the same girl next door. The same girl who would steal my shoes off the porch if I left them out. That's because you'd stuff snails in mine. You were always a bit mischievous. And you always got me back. I couldn't let you win. No, of course not. I remember my dad was crazy angry at you for something. What was it? You burned his entire collection of baseball cards! I thought they were yours! Besides, you had drawn on my face with a marker when I was camping in the backyard. Yeah, that was pretty good. [laughing] You know, I was always scared that your dad would come after me for burning those. He never did confront me about it. Well that's because I told him I did it. What? Why? Well, I didn't want you to get in trouble. Plus I was kind of impressed. You really one-upped me. I guess I should be grateful. Do you ever wonder when it was that we started to grow up? Maybe when you stopped coming to Tahoe. Yeah. And here you go. Oh, thank you. Thanks. Thank you for dinner. My pleasure. But I still owe you. Have you been by Mr. Webber's? Of course. You know he still remembers my favorite milkshake flavor. Mine too. Bananas foster. Oh! You're allergic. Yeah. I keep having to remind him so he doesn't get offended when I turn it down. You wanna go see him? I'll trade your bananas foster for my chocolate brownie if he unknowingly insists. Deal. Okay. You two have made my day. It's just like old times. You work too hard. Don't you have anyone to help? I got a couple of kids that come in, work a shift now and then. But this is my pride and joy. And here's your Bananas Foster. I'm always trying to get Mr. Webber to take a vacation. Vacation? Where would I go that's better than this? Seeing you two back together again, that's the cherry on top. [door chiming] Excuse me. Thanks for the milkshakes. Sure. Thanks. I wouldn't want you to have an allergic shock here. Well it's more like I break out in hives, but still, not fun. So, no more bananas, no more bananas foster. You're not an airline pilot. What else has changed? I'm a terrible businessman, apparently. You just need some marketing tips, that's all. That's a very nice way of putting it. What else has changed? I don't know. Maybe I'm the same at heart. HAve you ever been married? Nope. I had a girlfriend, a few, actually, but one wanted to get married. And then I realized, well, I didn't love her, so. What about you? Never married. Do you remember we used to sneak out to the lake at night? Yeah. The last night of our trip. Then we'd go to the dock and lay out and watch the stars. Talk about, What we wanted. And what worried us, anything that was on our minds. First day at school or parents fighting. Gossipy friends back home. Yeah. [both laughing] I remember on more than one occasion you wished you could stay in Tahoe forever. Me too. I miss those talks. Me too. [energetic music] Hey Kate, you ready? Yes. Do you want me to grab you a drink? Oh I just filled up my water bottle, I'm good. Oh hey, how was your dinner with Riley? It was good. Kind of seemed like a date. No. No, it's not like that. Was it ever? You two seem close. There were a lot of summers. I mean, sure, we liked each other but we never dated. Really it was just when we were teens, and when we were younger, you know, playing on swing sets and monkey bars. Okay. Just wondering. [phone chiming] Oh. Oh, it's Riley. Oh, what's he want? He wants to know what we're doing today. Do you want to invite him along? Sure. I'll text him back. [light music] You know the problem with living here? What? You never take enough time to appreciate how great everything is. True. It's like me going to the beach back home. You never do. Yep. Because it's always there. Well we have to make sure you appreciate this while you're here. [waves lapping] You got sunblock on your face. You bet I do. Oh, you have a smudge of it on your cheek. Oh. [chuckling] [phone ringing] Should I get that? No. I'll be right back. [phone ringing] Hey honey. Hi! Sorry I missed your call. I was on the water. The water, huh? Are you and Kate having fun? Yeah, we are. All play and no work. Actually, there's a little bit of work. I'm helping out a neighbor with promoting his business. Can you explain something to me? I'll do my best. I grew up in the same house my whole childhood, and even now I don't live far from it, but, I can't tell you the names of more than three kids I knew back then. So what's your question? Why are you and Eden so close? I don't know if we still are. We were when she was here. Maybe it's... There was this one year. We were maybe 12, 13 at the most. And for her, coming here was a summer vacation trip, something to look forward to. So she shows up, goes straight to the beach, stays out all day and was a lobster by night. Is that why she lathers on sunscreen like crazy? Yeah, her skin burned until she blistered. Ooh. And her mom forbade her from going outside for the rest of the week. And I didn't want her to be bored, so, I brought her treats, ice packs and games. Milkshakes from Mr. Webber's. [chuckling] And I kept her company. And honestly it was one of my favorite summers. Whether that's the reason we're close or not, I don't know, but, she was always a good friend. Well, I've got good news. Oh yeah? Yeah. My boss came to me today and he told me I'm being recognized internally at the firm. That's great! Recognized how? Well the annual company dinner is coming up, and they always give out awards and what not. Well this year, I get one, along with a nice little bonus. That's amazing! You so deserve that. Congratulations. The dinner is at the end of next week. Do you think you can make it? Of course. You and Kate will be back from your trip by then? I'll make sure we are. I'm so proud of you. Thanks. I miss you. I miss you too. All right, have fun at the lake. I will. Bye. Bye. [light music] Thanks for inviting me. I'm glad you could come. I'll see you tomorrow? Yeah I'll drop by with the flyers from the copy shop. Sounds good. Okay, bye. Bye. Bye. So Riley's nice. Yeah. Is he dating anyone? Not that he mentioned. Does he know you're dating Michael? Well it doesn't matter, we're just friends. So your relationship's just simple nostalgia? Mhmm. What's Michael then? He's wonderful. Supportive, grown-up. Don't you think? Yeah, yeah, I agree. Then what's the problem? Nothing. Okay, let's just enjoy the trip here. Okay. So your feelings for Michael aren't changing? Correct. And your feelings for Riley? [chuckling] Wow. You're getting really serious about this, huh? Yeah, let's hope so. Okay, here are addresses of places where you can leave the flyers. Mention my name if they look at you funny, but I've talked to all of them. And if you have friends with businesses, ask them about putting one up in a window. My cousin runs a bakery. Best donuts. Right? Perfect. So we all have our lists, so, Let's get going. Okay. Thank you. [light energetic music] Here, this is a good one. Thanks. Enjoy. Thanks for letting me put this up. Yeah. Have a nice day! You too. Hmm. [door chiming] You beat me here. Well I figured Mr. Webber would be very supportive. He says you owe him. So you finished, then? Yup, you? Pretty much. I wonder how long it's gonna take for us to see if this is working? I do have some online ads scheduled to start running. I should probably check on those stat. Whoa, calm down. It'll be fine. I haven't been this anxious about an ad campaign's performance in a long time. I doubt that. I'm serious. I want this to go well for you. Well, relax. The rest is out of your hands. In fact, maybe it's time you stop thinking about work, any work. How? [serene music] Oh, just like old times. Yup. Mmm. I love the sunset over the lake. Yeah, don't get that back home, huh? No. Sometimes I come down here by myself. But it's not the same. It's probably quieter. Well, quiet's overrated. It never gets this quiet back home. You could always come back here. I guess so. You should come back here more often. I've missed this. Me too. Do you ever think about the last time you were here? Yeah. We went on that gondola. Yeah, I remember. My stomach didn't like it. Yeah I was worried about that with the hot air balloon ride. I wasn't sure if it was a heights thing. Mmm, it's more of a rocking back and forth thing. Ah. And then afterwards, we went on that hike. To our favorite spot? It was overcast that day but I was determined to go. I really wanted to see how you felt about me. We kissed. I thought about that for a while. Me too. And then I went home and I wrote you a letter. You did? Yeah. Well I never sent it. But I thought about you. What did the letter say? Oh, you know. Come on, tell me. I wrote that I wished that I lived here and not so far away, so that I could see you more. And that I missed you. I've missed you too. You almost kissed him? Does that make me a horrible person? No, of course not. But you do need to come clean. What? Why? Because he deserves to know. Do you mean Riley or Michael? Both. I'm with Michael, and Riley is, What? What is he? A nice memory. It can't lead anywhere. Do you want it to? You don't know what you want. I didn't say that. And that's fine, but you can't move forward unless you let go of Riley or Michael. I don't have anything figured out. And I'm more confused than when I got here, and I still don't know what's up with my job, and, [sighing] I'm a mess. No, you're not. But if you don't figure it out, you will be. Hey. Oh, hey, Mr. Webber called for you. He did? Yeah he said it was an urgent freezer emergency, and he was calling in a favor. I've got things here under control if you wanna go and see him. All right [door chiming] Hey, Mr. Webber. Hi. Oh, this ice cream mix is no good. It's more like soup. And the freezer won't freeze. Okay, when did the freezer quit? Well I came in this morning to try it out, and all I got was this runny, soupy mess. Well, let me see what I can find. Well it's drawing power, so might be something with the compressor, maybe the wiring somewhere else. I hope I don't have to replace the whole thing. I replaced the stove two years ago. I'll do my best. Oh no pressure on you, Riley. I'm talking to myself. I'm just glad you could come out today. Happy to. I didn't interrupt your day too much, did I? No, quiet morning. Oh, really? With all those flyers out there, aren't they doing any good for you? Not yet. Well, you better enjoy the quiet times. Because later on it's gonna pick up and you're gonna be wishing for 'em. Thanks. So have you seen much of your neighbor lately? We've been spending some time together. You oughta take her on a proper date. I mean all I hear is people hanging out together and I don't, never knew where that saying came from. It's like a bunch of monkeys hanging from a tree. Well it's less risky that way. Nothing risked, nothing gained. I always thought you two suited. Well, we never really took that step. Our lives went in different directions. And ended up right back here. For now. It's temporary. Well. You better get with it. You fixed it! Is that what is usually sounds like? Yeah. Okay then. Hey Kate? Gone for that massage. I'll be back in time for dinner. Kate. [phone chiming] [sighing] Reese. What do you want on my forced time off? I hope you're enjoying your break. Could use your perspective on a project when you get a moment. Looking forward to having you back. [phone ringing] Eden, hi. Hi. Am I interrupting? I have a few minutes. How are you? I'm okay. Uh oh. I guess it's good. Reese just emailed me. Sounds like he wants me back. Fantastic! Yeah. So are you coming back sooner? I'm trying to decide. It's been nice out here. Oh, I bet. Tahoe sounds like a great place. Well, I say take whatever time you need. Oh, but don't forget about my company dinner. Right. No problem. I'll be back for it. Thanks. Hey, and great news about Reese. I knew it would all work out. Yeah, it's good. I'll talk to you later. Thanks for calling. Okay, bye. Bye. I need to get out. [gentle music] Huh, when did we get these? Thanks for coming with me. Happy to. I don't know when my parents got these. This wasn't really a thing when we were kids. You're making us sound old. I thought it was neat, and I figured we're here, so might as well try it. Well, I'm glad you called me. I think once you try this you're gonna get addicted. You're never gonna wanna go home. Speaking of home, I got an email from my boss today. And? Well, he wanted my input on some things. Isn't that good? Yeah, I guess it is good. It's good to be missed. I'm finding I don't miss it at all. Maybe you should consider a career change. That's too scary. I did it. So could you. You're still flying. And you can still market. But is that what you wanna do? It's not that I don't like marketing. There's a thrill in it sometimes. Like a pride in it. How so? When I figure the best way to make something great. Like a puzzle that I put together. You do like marketing. I think I'd miss it. So what's wrong? Is it what you're working on? I think it's easier to work on something you believe in. That could be it. I don't know, I wish I had more time to figure it out. So tell your boss you're not ready. And risk him rethinking and firing me if I'm not even sure? So you don't want to let go of one branch without having a grip on another one. Exactly. Well the way I see it, you have three options. I do? Yeah. First one, you go back to your old, unexciting job. Next option please. Second, come work for me as a poorly paid marketer. [Eden laughing] Hey, I'm all for you sticking around. Can't blame me for trying. The third option? Do nothing. Just take your time. You don't have to make a decision now or even next week. I do have to make a choice eventually. But when you're ready. Maybe after you've even had time to discover some new options. You know, if this hot air balloon thing doesn't work, you could be a career advisor. Let's hope it doesn't come to that. Should we do this? Yup. [grunting] I think I got this. Oh. Now use your oar to move yourself around. This is cool. Right? Yeah. So what's your secret? Trust yourself. Oh, gee, thanks. And tighten your stomach. Supposedly it helps with balance. Okay. So let me guess, you do this every weekend? No. Every other weekend. [chuckling] [light guitar music] [light guitar music] Hey. What are you doing out here? Nothing. Really? I'm just thinking. About? If I tell you, you're just gonna lecture me. I don't do that! Okay seriously, I won't do that, I promise. Riley kind of insinuated that he wants me to stay here. Wow. Gutsy. Is that even tempting? It is. It shouldn't be though, right? I have a life back home, and a job, sort of, and what he's saying is a huge change. Not just for job and home, but relationship-wise too. I know. It's crazy. And Michael is, Amazing, supportive, stable? Exactly. Why would I let that go? Riley was talking about what I should do for work and he said I don't have to make a decision. Maybe that's the same for here. Maybe I just need to put this aside and enjoy the rest of my time here. It sounds like good advice but you still need to be careful not to hurt one of them. Or yourself. Okay? Okay. And the card's expiration date? All right, you're all set for Monday, party of five. Yeah, sure thing. All right, I'll see you then. Party of five? The phone had not stopped ringing all morning. We have every single day booked for the next two weeks. Are you serious? That's amazing! Your friend has really got things rolling here. I'm going to go get things prepped for tomorrow's tour. [phone ringing] Hot Air Tahoe, can I help you? Let me check. So, guess how many calls I got? How many? 33. No, actually it was more than that. I lost count. I haven't had to answer the phone that often ever. But are people booking? Yeah! That's the crazy thing! I'm starting to wonder if we need to raise prices. You probably could, but maybe wait a bit. I don't want this to be an initial rush with no continued traffic from customers. Look at you, talking all business. Have you set up appointment booking online? I asked Spencer to, six months ago. It's not going well. I'm going to send you a link for a site that handles that. It's very affordable and it saves you time so you don't have to spend the day on the phone. Excellent. So what you working on? Web ads. What do you think? It looks... What? Legitimate. Well, good, because you are. I feel professional, and I'm not even doing the work. You are. And I'm gonna give you options, that way you don't have to use the same ad all the time. What for? To change it up for seasons, holidays, stuff like that. Got it. Okay. And there you go. I don't know what I'm going to do without you. Oh, I think you'll do fine. I'd rather not find out. Any chance you'll stay? You can get anyone to help you with this. Don't worry, it's not like your business will lose out. Well, it's not my business I'm worried about losing. So what are your plans for the rest of your stay? I've got clients coming out of nowhere, trying to get on my schedule. I might have to work 10 hours a day when I get back. It's good to be in demand, right? I guess. I'm still dreading it. Me too. When's your next appointment? Monday. Are you going back to work then too? I'm still figuring it out. [thoughtful music] Yeah just a few more things to load up and should be all set. Great. Yeah I've got to get to bed early. I've been used to sleeping in. Oh yeah? Well I'd say I'm sorry but no sleep means work and a paycheck. I'll take it. Eden mentioned we should do something to encourage customers to leave reviews. Yeah, like a follow-up email or something? Or we could give away a free t-shirt for every good review? I don't think bribery is the way to go. I'll have to ask her for some ideas on that. Well, is she staying? I'd like her to, but, But what? Well, too early to tell. Are you two dating? Too early to tell. Well, sounds like you have a lot to clear up. I'm just gonna finish loading up. All right, thanks, Spencer. [light music] These are beautiful. Here you go. Great. Thank you. Thank you. This is just about done. Great. [knocking] Oh, I'll get it. Michael? Eden. So I was thinking about your call, and seeing you, and about Tahoe and it dawned on me, why not come for the weekend at least? I'm glad to see you. Riley! Michael! Oh, hi Kate. Riley. This is Michael. My boyfriend. Hi. Good to meet you. Nice flowers. Yeah, they're for Eden, and Kate, as a thank you for their help with my business. Oh, you're the neighbor that Eden's been helping out. Uh, I guess so. [chuckling] You didn't have to do that. I know, but... Yeah. Dinner's ready. Oh great. I'm starving. Nice tan! Thanks. I just wanted to drop those off. Riley, I didn't know. The response to the flyers and everything has been great. We've been getting a lot of business. So, thank you. Riley. You have company. Good night, Eden. Night. [sighing] [solemn music] [Eden sighing] You know, I'll be right back. Okay. You were right. I'm sorry. I don't like being right. At least not with this. Should I tell Michael about Riley? I think you could. I don't want to hurt him too. I think he would understand. But it's more urgent you talk to Riley. I'm sorry I didn't tell you about Michael. I didn't mean to keep it from you. It's your life. And we're just old friends. You're more than that. But not enough. That's not true. Isn't it? But it's okay. I've really enjoyed seeing you again. Me too. And my business, I really got a shot now, thanks to you. Thanks for letting me help. And for being my friend. Here you go. Thank you. Better get that to Riley right away before it melts. Oh, it's not for him. I'm gonna miss these. Are you leaving? Yeah. It's been wonderful, but too bad it's just temporary. Now wait a minute. Not everything is temporary. The way you feel here and now, that'll stay with you. [door chiming] I should let you go. Eden. If you go back, what do you leave behind here now? Thanks, Mr. Webber. [melancholy music] So how are your tax deadlines? Ah, chopping away at them, bit by bit. It's nice not to be in the office though. Breath of fresh air, and all that. Yeah. Listen, I should have come sooner. You asked me and I just made excuses. Well you're busy, I understand that. Well I was talking to Kate, and she helped me realize how upsetting the last couple of weeks have been for you. Well, I wouldn't say it was upsetting. Nerve-wracking? Either way, I should have been here. [phone chiming] Oh. What is it? Oh, it's Reese. He wants to know if I can make it to an all-hands on meeting Tuesday. Wow, he really wants you back. Yeah. He's seen what life's like with you out of the office and he doesn't like it. I'm so glad this worked for you. Me too. Is that everything? Yep, I double-checked. Even under the furniture. You're thorough. Ready? Yeah, I'm just gonna lock up. Okay, sounds good. Hey. Hey. [light melancholy music] Hi. Hey. We're leaving. Work and all that. Going back to it, huh? Yeah. I hope it works out. Thanks. I should go. Hey, if you're in town again, you should come by the shop. See if we're following your advice well or not. I definitely will. Goodbye, Riley. Goodbye, Eden. Hey, you want me to drive? Yeah, sure. [car starting] [thoughtful guitar music] All right, now normally divide up assignments here, and we'll get to that. But I want to start with some news. Good news. We have two brand new clients under contract now. Castle Vacuums and MinFloral Air Fresheners. [clapping] Right? This is gonna be great for us. They're eager to hit the ground running, so let's get to work ASAP. Bobbi, you take Castle Vacuums. Eden, you up for MinFloral? Absolutely. Excellent. [knocking] Come in! Hey, honey. How was work today? Good. Did you cook? No, it's a new client product. MinFloral Air Freshener. MinFloral? Yeah I think it's because it's pure minerals, added with floral scents. At first thought Min meant mini, but this isn't that small, so. Interesting. Yeah. So, I wanted to plan out Friday's dinner. Oh, what time does it start? Well for once I wanna be early. So are you okay if I picked you up at 5:30? I'll be ready. Great. What's the dress code? I'm wearing a suit and a new tie. A new tie, hmm, okay! I'll be sure not to embarrass you then. Oh, thank you. [light guitar music] Hey. How's it coming together? Good. The market survey I put together comes back tomorrow so that'll help me fine-tune what I'm going to present. I can't wait to see it. Yeah. [light whimsical music] [door chiming] Hey. Hey Riley, how you doing? Good, I just wanted to check on that freezer. Is it running all right? Ever since you fixed it. It's got a few more years on it now, thanks to you. Good. So what can I get you? Oh nothing, I was just passing by, I thought I'd check in. Okay. Well how's that business doing? I see your balloon floating around every morning. It's been popular lately. Good, good. So have you heard from Eden lately? No, no. Not since she went back home. Well you could call her, you know. Yeah, I think she's moved on. And that's okay. As long as she's happy. You're a good kid, you know that? Are you nervous about the pitch? No, not really. But maybe I should be, because then I'd come across as excited about it. Well I'll admit, air fresheners are pretty dull. Yup. Could you ask Reese for a different assignment? It was either this or vacuums. Oh wow. Mhmm. Nah, it's fine. It's work, right? Well, you know, you could still make a change. What do you mean? You know, quit your job. I can't. You just, you don't seem happy to be back. And maybe it's not just because of the job. Imagine. You feel a migraine coming on. The weight of the world constantly on your shoulders. But whether you're at work or at home, MinFloral can be a sanctuary and a shield. Let the natural mineral aromas lift your spirits, invigorate your body, ward off the stressors that come at you in every direction. In an array of award-winning and inventive aromas, MinFloral is the element missing to feel stronger and renewed. MinFloral. Mineral ingredients, floral scents, fresher life. [audience clapping] Thank you. I like it. What type of ad campaigns do you see being most effective for MinFloral? Well the standard for the air freshener industry is print-based, but I think that's outdated. I want to get you on video for the coupon and shopping apps, as well as targeted campaigns in the online and broadcast space. Targeted to your demographic, of course. I love it. One question though. I don't think the hot air balloon fit. Oh. Eden? Ah, well, we can leave that part out. I was going for a parallel of open, fresh air, like when you're in a hot air balloon. Oh. All ads will get your final approval before we run, so don't worry about anything that seems out of place. Right. [chuckling] If we hurry, we can get these locked in now while ad inventory is high. I think we can negotiate better placements now rather than waiting for too long. That sounds sensible. You had me slightly worried with the hot air balloon thing, but you handled it great. Thanks. There's a lot to do in a short time on MinFloral, but I think you can do it if you're willing to put in some extra time. And then I have a plant fertilizer client that I want to assign to you. Plant fertilizer? The landscape and gardening industry's number three company. They're aggressively trying to take the lead. So, I'll add that to your accounts. Actually... Maybe you should give that to someone else. What do you mean? I mean, maybe you should give all my accounts to someone else. [knocking] Hey. Hey. Hmm. I'm so sorry, ugh. Today was crazy and I totally forgot. I'll be right out. Okay. The freeway's going to be a mess right now. But we can probably make up the time on another route. Good. So work was crazy today, huh? Sort of. I quit my job. You quit? You did? Yep. Is everything all right? That's kind of sudden, isn't it? I mean what are you going to do? I don't know yet. But I wasn't happy. You know maybe you should think it over. You could talk to Reese on Monday. No, it's fine. Okay. If you say so. I didn't know your job made you so unhappy. I don't think it's just my job though. What do you mean? All this time. I know. It's hard because I love and care for you so much. I feel the same about you. I guess we were never really in love with each other. It was comfortable. And we let it go on. Yeah. So when did you figure this out? When I got back. But, I guess it started in Tahoe. There was a friend there, Riley. And I realized that what I felt for him was different than how I feel for you. Oh. Are you upset? No. Actually I know exactly how you feel. There's something I wanna tell you too. You and I started dating but as it went on we spent time with each other's friends. A lot of time. Well, I started to... Kate! Yeah. I couldn't bring myself to tell either of you. I would hate myself if I ever came between you. I get it. I want you, and Kate, to be happy. You do? Definitely. This day has gone very differently than I thought. For me too. Yeah. Oh, your dinner! You know what, don't worry about it. No, you can still make this, yes. [knocking] Eden, what's going on? Go put on a nice dress. What, why? Because you are going to a dinner party in honor of Michael. What, I am? Yeah. Hi Kate. Okay Eden, seriously, what's going on? There's not a lot of time, but to sum it up, Michael and I broke up, and Michael has had feelings for you for a while, and as I think of it more and more, you like him too, and I couldn't be happier for the both of you. Okay, wait, what?! Just think about it. Even in Tahoe, you were worried about me, yes, but you didn't want Michael to get hurt. And you've been such a good friend to me but I don't want you to miss out on something special with him. And speaking of special, Michael's dinner started about five minutes ago. So what do you say, Kate? Will you come with me? Be my date? Yes. What will you do? I don't know yet. Don't worry about it. Have fun. Eden. Yeah. [soft guitar music] You all have a nice day. Thanks, bye. How was it? Oh, fine. No wind really. Good. Did the no-show come while we were in the air? Nope. I guess they just forgot. Who's that? I guess that's the no-show. Maybe they just got the time wrong. Wait. [energetic music] Did I miss the tour? That was you? I drove as fast as I could to get here. Sorry, you missed it. Ugh, that's too bad. You know, normally there's no refunds, but maybe I could take you up for a private tour another day, if you're in town for a while. I am. And I'd like that. Maybe I might give you a good review. I didn't think you were coming back. It's like you said, I needed time to figure it out for myself. And have you? I think so. Good. 'Cause I didn't want to wait another 10 or 15 years to see you again. Me neither. [uplifting music] I had two resorts here contact me about running a marketing push for them. I'm not surprised. I think I'm gonna pick one to work on. Good for you. Nice, huh? This whole working for yourself idea isn't bad. See why I like it? I do. I really do. [light music]
