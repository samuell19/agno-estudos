The Initiation Be careful! Behave! Stop! Excuse her Master. It's the heat. That's all. Good morning! I'm Ursula. Do you remember me? Yes. Good morning, Ursula. Of course, you have changed in these three years. - Roger! - Come on, your mother's waiting for you. Let me embrace you. Was it a pleasant journey? - Yes, mama. - How did your pants get dirty? It just happened, the dog did it. I'll get a cloth. You'll never change, Roger. When things get dirty, you're always first. - It just happens at his age. - I wasn't dirty. You weren't either. Give me that. I'll clean it myself. Purity of heart begins with one's clothing. Don't forget. Clothes and shoes. Good morning. It's Mr. Frank. - You remember Mr. Frank? - No. He's a friend of your father's. Come on. Everything's ready. Then, if you have time, you'll do some stargazing. Like Aunt Margarite? How many times have I told you to be quiet? You shouldn't be joking with adults at your age. - Hello, Roger! - Hello! No, not on the mouth. Do like me. Close your eyes. Don't move, listen. - Do you hear? - No. Stay still. Don't you hear their sound? They're all around us. They're whispering. Listen. Now do you hear them? Come and help me, Miss? Mrs. Muller! We picked them for you. No, they're not washed. My husband. You'll find he's changed, right? Good morning, Mr. Muller! One moment. Let's go. Good morning, Master Roger! Sit up straight! Keep your hands on the table! How many times must I tell you? Why do you tell us all the time? Mr. Frank always has his hand under the table. It's an American custom. For them it's good manners. The Americans don't know what "good manners" means. - Thank you, Helene. - When is Daddy coming? He has a mountain of work. He'll come in a few days. And Elisa's fianc√©? He should be arriving with her, I don't know. What is your future son-in-law like? He's a second lieutenant in the Air Force. - It's dangerous. - Yes. But he comes from an excellent family. Helene! Thank you. Look! Elisa sent me a picture. They are so beautiful together. They seem very in love. I know. It looks like a postcard to me. Enough, Berthe! Say good night to everyone and then go to bed. Kate! It's early mama, I want to stay with Roger a while. I said to bed! No discussion! Kate! It's not fair. Miss... Please take this little girl. Say your prayers, and then go to bed immediately. Of course, my lady. Let's go! Put your hand over your mouth. Mama, may I... First of all; before speaking, you must stop yawning. Seems incredible, I must tell him everything. Mama... May I go... I'm sleepy? Yes, say good night to your aunt and Mr. Frank. Children should be treated like children, as long as possible. Good night. - Good night, Roger. - Good night. Good night. Go right to sleep. No thinking about anything. How are your solar observations going? Right now you can see explosions of unprecedented violence! I have never seen such strong repeated explosions! I'm not sure if you understand what I mean. Years that end with seven or multiples of seven... ...are always warm. - I'm not sleepy, are you? - I am. Can I stay here a while? But no talking. Good night. Sleep well. Do you think Aunt Marguerite is beautiful? Yes. The other day, Helene was talking about her and said: Being a virgin at her age isn't normal. She's never been engaged? No, she's afraid of men. Mama says so. And Mr. Frank? Mr. Frank...? He's nice! But his head's always in the clouds. He's ugly. Helene... is the one who served at the table? Yes, why? I only wanted to know. What is that? What have you got there? Nothing. I know what it is, want me to say it? - No! - Kate told me about it. - In English? - Yes, she's really nice. - There are a lot of women in the house. - A lot. I can't stand them. What are you doing in bed with your brother? I'll never get to sleep. I'll never go back to him again. I turned away and I ran, I heroically resisted. You are a heroine. What heat. At least say thanks... Thank you. How is your husband? Is he better? He can't get it up. In that case, what good is a man? - It seems like you like him a lot. - That's the problem. If I didn't love him, I wouldn't suffer. You'll succeed with someone else? I don't know what to say. I don't believe it. Now what are they talking about? Mrs. Muller's husband. I saw him yesterday in the woods. - What was he doing? - I'm not sure. Don't make me pray to The Holy Virgin and all "The Saints". If you can't go on a pilgrimage, you'll find someone to replace him. No. Look up there. There are three beauties. Grazie, Graziella and Graziola. What are you doing, ladies? Getting some water... some air? - Is it refreshing? - I'll have a little wine, please? No answer, beautiful? Hey! Are you asleep? Come here. Come on. They're from around here... and in church. I've seen them before. Hey there! Does my pisser interest you? Careful toad! It appears to have died! If you don't mind; shrew, I'll bring it to life! - Do I mind? - I don't mind, perhaps Ursula does! Ursula! Ursula doesn't want to see, but we all know her ass! That will refresh your memory! - It's Daddy! - He's here with Elisa! - Hi, Daddy. - Angel. Hi, baby, hi. First go and wash. I've told you a thousand times. - Not even a hug? - You're covered in dust. - Not in front of the children. - Hello, Roger. - You grew. - Yes, Father. - Very good. My dear Elisa, you're looking beautiful. - Hello Bertha. - Hello. Good morning, Elisa. Good morning. - You look good, Mama. - It's true. The weather has invigorated me. How was your trip? It's a pleasure by car. How goes the factory? Bad. These are difficult times, hopefully they'll pass quickly. Look... Papa's samples. Take a look at these competing products. I have a catalogue. It offers decorations and medals at incredible prices. You know? I don't know what I'll do. Take a look. You could produce more... Or poorer quality products. Maybe even sell abroad. It seems that this obscure factory produces the famous St. Catherine of Sienna. - Even German medals. - It's a mistake. Not to mention decorative cord. I proposed it to be used by the cavalry. I've got a spare in the shed. Roland says that aviation needs more. Aviation is a new branch of the army. It's a small market, with no future. If war doesn't start quickly, my feet will be in the air. - Then sales... - Guaranteed. Lunch is served. Let's have lunch. He who makes military medals in peace time, eats a bitter bread. - That beast. - Why do you say beast? He is the one who threw me after only three weeks of marriage. I wanted to become a general but I had to retire because of my leg. Since then, I've tried to restore my military rank. We hope you make it. We all hope, it's been ten years since I've spoken of that war. That beast. This year will explode. It comes in fire. How do you know? The sun is never wrong. Good... You were peeking. It's not paradise, I'm only happy with you. - Do you go to confession? - No. I don't. I do. But I never tell everything to Father Gabriel. God knows you lied. God. What do you think he thinks of me? Who is Father Gabriel? Take me on your back. He's a Capuchin monk of a monastery near here. He always goes barefoot. Even in winter! - Come on, I'll show you something. - What will I see? Come on, don't ask. I discovered this by accident. Be careful. - We're here. - Where? The confessional. Listen. Can you hear? It's a confessing wife. Mrs. Muller. What else? Any other penance? No. We have too much work. It's always entertaining, I'm going. - Where are you going? - It's late for me. I'm going. You can stay. Sometimes it's funny. Go in peace. Forgive me Father, I have sinned. Have you sinned in thought or deed? In thought. - So it is. - Yes, Father. Speak, I'm listening. It's stronger than me. I can't free myself of certain images. Images of a carnal sin? They are images of men. They're workers on the farm. Last time... - Even the image of a child. - A child? What child? My nephew. Since he arrived, I keep thinking of him. I think I'm using the bath on Sunday. The warm water excites me. The smell of his body. The touch of his body. One day I saw him naked, I realised that he had became a man. He was standing in front of me. I don't know why... We embraced... And we kissed. Then with his mouth... Then I ran desperately. I haven't seen him in many days. I've felt unclean since then. Yes... what else? Several times I looked in the mirror while naked. And with my hand... Always alone? Yes. No, no. Do you know the governess? Even if you say, it gave you no pleasure. Roger! It's Roland! Good morning, Roland. Thanks. Come on. Let's go. - Mama, can I come down? - Later, I told you. This is my brother, Roger. He did something stupid and he's a louse. This time of year, they are very prickly. On your knees! Ten lashes. Don't cry, Roger. It's nothing. They did it out of boredom. There's no other way for them to have fun. You can think about your aunt's confession. You? - Does it still sting? - Yes. If you want, I can put a little cream on it. No, I feel better. - You saw Helene? - Yes, poor thing. - Who is that? - It's a mystery. I don't know. - Really? - It's the same story every night. - It's a man? - Of course. I'm sure it's a man. And what are they doing? They're... They're... Go to bed. Get going, before a catastrophe happens. Pardon me Roger, I need to use the bathroom. Do the stars interest you? Yes. You can't see well tonight. It's cloudy. And the sun? - Is it true what you said? - Of course. Theory says that solar activity determines our behaviour. At least it influences us. When explosions occur; people become impulsive, it's the opposite for some others. We believe that we control events. But it's the sun that determines them. - What is carnal sin? - It can be many things, Roger. - For example, war? - Yes. Exactly. Mr. Frank. - At my age were you frustrated? - Yes. Did you have the impression that everything is bad without exception? You were at risk of being punished? Honestly... I feel it now. Good night. Good night. Attention! At ease. Approach! What's your name, soldier? Take off your clothes! As I suspected, you're a woman. - What are you doing here? - I've come for you, I want to be yours. So you are a little beast. Get a good look? I was downstairs in the kitchen drinking a glass of water and what do I see? I bow to you Master. What will you tell your parents when they find out? Oh, no! No. Don't say anything. First you spy on your aunt's confession... - Now you eavesdrop on your parents? - No, please. Maybe you should come to the casino with me? No. Please don't say anything. I'll do whatever you want, Mr. Romano. As you say. Whatever you want, Mr Roland. Give my car a good shine. Inch by inch. Hello, Adolphe. - Helene. - Huh? I've got something in my hair, can you get it out? Show me. What are you doing, are you crazy? Let go of me, Adolphe! You're crazy, what are you doing? I want you to calm down. Help me, Master Roger! Free me, quick! Get me out of here! Quickly! Wait a minute! You may wait a bit, there's no need to rush! Do it like that. Get out of here! Get out! Get out! Hey... Master. How are you doing? You manicure your nails. Such beautiful hands. What beautiful hands you have. It's a pleasure to watch you driving, while you're eating... You do everything perfectly. For example, I hate men I see with a finger up their nose. I would never be able to marry someone who has such a habit. I will never allow my children to do it. This morning, a maid fell in a dunghill. She was completely dirty. Everywhere. Her breasts and hair. A nauseous smell. Excuse me, Mama. When will you let me talk about such things? When you're older. These aren't clean, Roger. So they're not. You didn't clean them. How can I wear these boots? You're right, they're a little shitty. Roger! Where did you learn that word? Mama, would you like to know who I surprised last night? He was listening at the door to your room. - What? - Yes, in the middle of the night. Roger... Go, I do not want to see you! Do you understand? Go! We educated our daughters, but he... He's hopeless. I don't know what to do. Punishment doesn't help anything. How is it possible for two people like us to create such a specimen? - I'm desperate. - I know what he needs. I would give him a few days in my company. He would taste discipline. Right, sweetheart? Right! Sweetheart! My heart... ...trembles like a rose... And as his tongue slides... ...in my ass... ...I begin to come... Oh, Master Roger. It was you. I thought it was someone else. Come on, I'll get some cold water. Sometimes on the ass, sometimes on the head. Such is life. - Are women always so hurtful? - Often. - Often men as well. - In what way? You can't guess? I'm finished, Ursula. Look how beautiful it is. Good morning, Master. Would you like a taste? Where are you going? Good morning, Master. It must be today, today or never. Gustavo! Gustavo! The saddle is ready! Gustavo! Why are you saying a prayer again? Gustavo! Did you hear what I said? I was waiting in the stables. Who is it? It's you, Master. Gustavo. You're still there. Finish up. Let's go, Gustavo! You've got to help! If you don't hurry, we'll have to say prayers for you! Gustavo! What are you doing, Master Roger? You're crazy, Master? Let me go. You're hurting me! There, no! No... What are you trying to do! You're a devil, Master! Wait! So... Yes, yes... Yes, Master! ...War! War has broken out! Germany has declared war! War! War! They've started the war! - The newspaper has the latest news! - Let me see. - I want to see it. - Read. Germany declares war with France. To tell the truth, it was time to start. - They say it will be a big war. - Don't joke. I hope that it will take at least a year. - Imagine that. - We'll resist one year. - Will you go back to the factory? - With the utmost speed. Have you been called up, Mr. Frank? No. I suffer from asthma. How unfortunate. - To victory! - To victory! Yes, yes, but no hurry. - To victory! - To victory! To victory! Good evening, Master Roger. It's terrible. I may never see again. - Will you wait? - How can you ask me that? I'll wait until the end of the world. I'll wear a picture of you next to my heart. Be careful up there. - I want you to be proud of me. - Yes. Behave yourself. Don't take unnecessary risks. Go in peace. - See you soon... - Goodbye! Master Roger, can you help me? What should I do? Your mother has decided to move some things. Why? Maybe she's afraid now. Be careful. Master... I'm working. - I'm helping you. - Liar. You're not helping me at all. You're molesting me. It's very complicated to take a woman's clothes off. A gentleman must have respect for a maid's lingerie. With delicacy. Like this. This is the first time I've seen you naked, Master. Not bad. Not bad at all. Wait! We should make love all the time. - Why don't we Ursula? - I've asked myself that. Can you even imagine. It would be wonderful. Ursula, I want to marry you. I love you. A very bad start. Why? If you talk like that with all the girls, you'll never have a comfortable life. I love you, that's the truth. My mother tells me that I should. Your skin... I want to touch you everywhere. You are so sweet. I'm sure I love you. And your skin is very soft. You're kind, you're honest. - Honest? You think I'm honest? - Yes. Was it your first time? Yes. I'll never forget my first time. I tell you. Your shirt's torn. - You did it? - Yes. - With who? - I'm not telling you. - You did it with Kate? - No. Not with Kate. What are you waiting for? Mama's talking to Father Gabriel. Come on. My dream was my husband. Now it's my nightmare. At first... he was a normal man. But not long after, he was something radically different. - Very radically different? - I don't know how to say it... It's an infernal dream. He's like a ghost. Then he forces me... into... position. - Do you understand, Father? - What type of position? To look a particular way. Fine... Well... do you derive pleasure? How should I tell you... Yes... in a certain way. But being honest, I think it's only human. - Should I do it if it happens again? - Yes. Some of these things... I can't do with my husband. I feel so humiliated... should I look for a specialist? No. You know... Excuse me. Yes... There are three answers. First, adultery is prohibited, it's not possible... for your husband to go with another... you must maritally satisfy him. And secondly... You should please your husband... ...as a woman... ...a little better than you have. And then third, is that you must forgive him... and in time of war... the test of love and fidelity to one's husband... What's is going on, Roger? Roger! Get over here! Roger, I told you to come here. Now that you only have one man what will you do to me? - Did I surprise you? - Yes. I did, excuse me. - You never come here, Miss. - I know. I was afraid. - There isn't any danger now. - Why not? Because the men have all gone to war. Are you afraid of men? - All women are afraid. - Why? Because... Because of... Because. Catch! A gift for you. Now... I've heard nice things about you. - Who told you? - You know. No. Tell me. They say that you're doing some things secretly with the maid. Some things? Like what? - Do you know what I really like? - Me? Want to see? - How's it going? - Everything's fine. Everything's fine. I saw the minister. We need a little time, but I'll manage. - How long will you be staying? - Monday morning I must be at the factory. Have you mobilized any workers? Only those available. I thought about hiring women, it costs less. - How's everything here, dear? - Ah... it's idyllic. Look! The newspaper has a picture of Romano! He's downed another plane. - That makes three! - It's true. - He's like a handsome angel. - Yes. The uniform suits him well. Aviation is a miracle. Metal which is lifted into the air. Look! He has a medal made by my Papa. It's true. With such men the war will end soon. Let's hope that it lasts longer. Mama... why is it being fought, this war? Well... Because... Because it is. Ask your father, he knows what to tell you. Papa? Can you explain it to me? - You can blame the Germans. - Why, what happened? - A lot of crap... - What, for example? I'll tell you tomorrow. Now it's late. Do you know, Aunt...? Do you know what caused this war? No, no one told me. I think that men just like to fight and kill. But you, would you like to fight? No, no, I feel fine right here. What do you see? What are they doing? You look. Go on. Boo! Roger! Do you have one last wish? Any parent or anyone? - No. - No. You're alone. This is the end of the line, madam. I hope you'll be brave. Show me how to die a woman. Prepare yourself for execution. Now we put on your blindfold. You won't see how death will come. Platoon! Prepare to fire! Ready! Oh! Roger! - Roger! - Don't be upset, Mama. I saved your life. Why does my brother-in-law behave like that? - For love, without any doubt. - And my sister is happy. Evidently. What goes on in the minds of men. It's a mystery. Good evening, dear aunt. Roger! What are you doing on my bed? - I wanted a good night kiss. - Of course, I'll kiss you. Now go. I wanted a kiss like the one you gave me when I was a kid. Get out of here immediately, or I'll call your mother. - Don't get angry. - I said get out. I hear footsteps. What'll I do? I don't want him to see me like this. Open up, Marguerite. It's me, I want to talk to you. - At this hour, it's impossible. - I've written something. - What? - A poem. If you like, you can recite it through the door. - Will you listen? - Yes, I promise. Among all the souls that have amazed me... And galaxies that I rove. Marguerite my darling... Are you still a virgin, aunt? I'm not any more. ...when I was a kid. I adored you so much. ...ooh... It's here, it's here at last. Ah... you love music. And medicine. - Do you enjoy these pornographic pictures? - How should I say it... yes. - A little. - More than the sun? What kind of question is that? When you know you could spend Saturday night in a brothel... ...in the country... I'm sure you will give thanks to the war. Why don't you sleep with a woman? It's so easy. Yes... for you. What a lovely vision you are. Come in. Nothing going on down the hall? Not since the start of the war. Since it's neither my father, nor Mr. Frank. Nor is it you, Master. - Who could it be? - In my opinion, Mr. Muller. He always had such a large hard-on. - His wife says he can't do it any more. - He does it with his lover. But now things are quiet. Yes, Master Roger. Now things are too quiet. Why did you decide to come at this hour? No reason. I thought some tea... You know what I need. I can't sleep. Good night, Helene. Did you do it with Kate? Yes. - How was it? - Very nice. Did she tell you? Yes. She told me you did it with Ursula. And Ursula told me you did it with Helene. - Is it true? - Yes. Then you did it with everyone. Almost. And with Aunt Marguerite? Yes, but not completely. - But you will do it? - Who knows? Oh, look who's coming. - Do your legs hurt? - Yes, with these tight boots. - Sit down, I'll take them off. - Yes. - Are you warm? - Yes. - Then why don't you get undressed? - You're right, I'm going to get changed. No! You can do it here. That way, I can help you. In the barn? Sure. Why not? And the horses are naked. You've really changed a lot. What's the big idea? Roger! Let me be, are you crazy? And the first inhabitants of Earth were. - But we are not first! - And if we were on a desert island? We are not on an island. Roger! What are you doing? - No way. - Wait and see. - If Roland knew... - Who's going to tell him. You've done someone new, it looks difficult in these pictures. I think I'm doing alright. After you. Miss Kate. I've been waiting for you. Master Roger and his Aunt Marguerite need you. Go on. I've come alone in order to help you. Why are you so sleepy? What has happened to you? At my age I need to sleep more. Want to know something? I think I'm pregnant. - You're really pregnant? - I'm expecting a child - It's something very serious. - It's wonderful. Now what am I going to do? What will I tell mother? It's Romano! Get up... quickly! Let's hide! If they see us, they'll think something bad! He's a hero. It's Romano! Like Icarus challenged the sky! - Now I am a captain. - How handsome. I was promoted last night. Romano. You're the best. You're my hero. Look... I always took it with me. It came in contact with the enemy. In combat... it's inevitable. And... do you know what this is? My lieutenant's cap. Another hole. I will give you a new one, Romano. With a captain's braid. Bravo! There's nothing to be afraid of. Stay calm. - To the captain's health! - Salud! Looks like we have a good wine this year. Now, tell us a beautiful story, Romano. Through the morning... A soldier marches. He was a hero, with the wind and the air in his face. Suddenly... ...something happened to his legs, ...and he falls into a hole. This hole was the belly of a horse... dead for a couple weeks. An asphyxiating odour, terrifying. The soldier fails to maintain his balance and slips back. He moves his legs, in order to free himself from the carcass. He tries to escape, he uses all his strength... He can't do anything. The gas chokes him and he dies. I would never tell such a ugly story at the table. What are you saying, Roger? It's the war. The war isn't a triviality. He's a kid, he doesn't have to worry. Let's get started. Lift him up. - I don't know if he'll resist. - Are you sure? It's what we were told at the hospital, it's the only way to elongate his leg. - He must be stretched? - As much as possible. We must do this every day for a year. Let's lift him up. Let's pull! Up! Up! That's it, help! Stronger! Higher! Heave-ho! Heave-ho! Is it better to lose a leg? Or an eye? Depends on what you use it for. What's happened, Mrs. Muller? My poor husband. He's died. Look what they sent me... a medal and the bullet that killed him. Nothing else? Why are you crying? You always said that he would be better that way. He was my husband. If I don't cry for him, who will? Hey... Get me down! Helene, Ursula! At the summit... desire. Roger! I must tell you something. - I'm pregnant. - You too? - What do you mean, me too? - No... my sister Elisa is. - And who's next? - Now what am I going to do? I must marry you. Marry me? With you? Maybe... - With Adolphe. - I don't think so. It's not like before with his crippled leg. Valentin? - He's nice, lovable. - But he's one-eyed. Even better, I can do what I like behind his back. Ursula, will you do me a favour? Do you have some nail polish? Coloured red? - No, but I can get some. - Good. You have to hurry! It's an emergency! - I must speak with you. - Sure. Come in. It's something delicate and uncomfortable. - You're expecting a child. - How did you know? - It's the season. - What can I do? - Simple, get married. - With who? With Mr. Frank. You'll be happy, he doesn't ask much of life. - With Mr. Frank? - He's a wonderful man. Trust me. You'll be happy together. I must make him believe that he is the father of the child. - I brought it. - Wait here. One problem is solved. Come with me. - You don't know how to knock? - Put a few drops here. Let's not exaggerate. Ursula, what are you doing? - I'm doing it for your sake, Miss. - Are you crazy? Give me that! Wait, Elisa. Try to think. Calm yourself, Elisa. It's not broken. Now stop. Ursula, go back to my room. I'll be right there. It's for your own good. Now go to Romano. Tell him that you love him and you can't live without him. Tell him whatever you want to get him into bed. - But he has principles. - Principles, are you stupid? A woman knows what to do. Remember what he's doing for the country. Get going! He's going to sleep. Come on! You stay here. A woman must always be convincing. Don't forget. Who is it? Open up... It's me, Marguerite. Marguerite. The sky is clear tonight, I wanted you to show me the stars. The war will not end soon. You know that. I don't want to lose you. It's not a sin now, Father Gabriel says so. It's not the same as in a time of peace. Let's go. - What do you want? Come in. - No... I have a lot to do tonight. - I must ask you something. - Go ahead. - Are you pregnant? - No. Why? Because I'm finished at last. Good night. No, no. Tonight, I don't want any tea. - Why? - You can break the cups. After this I'm going to have good luck. It will always accompany me in the sky. I hope you're not in too much pain. No, not much. At this moment, we wish God to bless these marriages. And to give children as soon as possible. Remember that not only is it most Christian... ...and in these difficult times, it's a patriotic duty. We must repopulate our martyred country. More than ever, our homeland needs energetic youth... who will defend her. Our country needs life. If I have a boy, I will name him Roger. I was thinking the same thing. And you, Ursula? What name will you give him, Ursula? Honestly, I think I'll call him Roger Why do you all think alike? What have I done to deserve this honour? Hi Berthe, hi Kate! - Hi! - Hi! And you? You're not going to defend the country? No. Because I'm British. It was the most wonderful vacation. It seems that the enemy is advancing. See you soon in town. Goodbye, Roger. Why goodbye? You live in town. - And Valentino? - Valentino is not a husband. But he knows how to serve a wife. - You can come to town, to visit me. - No, I don't think so, Roger. Remember that I wanted to marry you. Why not? Don't you feel anything for me? I don't want to think about it. I did it without thinking. You see. Everything is made to be forgotten. Maybe one day, you won't remember my name. I will always remember you. - And you? - Me too. Roger! I'm going. I have to load my bags. - Can I help you, Master Roger? - No, thank you. - Helene. You too... - Yes. Me too. - You have to find a husband. - Why? It's not necessary. - Your father's calling. - Thank you, Miss. Hurry up, we're late I brought fruit for the trip. - I picked them with my own hands. - Thank you. Good bye. Don't forget. In the city there are many temptations for a young man. Especially in time of war. Roger!
