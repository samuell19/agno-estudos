[bell dinging] [horn blowing] [band music] [music continues] [audience cheering] [male #1] 'Come on, Frank! You got it baby. You beat him.' [commentator #1] 'And touchdown. Number 16 Frank Gifford.' [audience cheering] Ha? How about that? Ha? [audience cheering] [cheering] Fantastic! Fucking fantastic. That's what I want. Fame and adulation. You can get it here in the nut house. Oops! [man on TV] 'This is Gifford with the ball.' All the way, Frank. Alright! Alright. Yeah! [man on TV] 'Gifford puts the Giants in front. What a player he is.' I know Frank Gifford. [male #2] 'Oh, yeah?' [male #1] 'Come on, Frank. Come on, Frank.' [commentator #1] 'Gifford again and he's gotta make' 'thirty yards for a first down.' 'And he's done it! He's done it!' [audience cheering] Frank Gifford is one of the greatest of American football players ever. What's so important about football? It's only a game. [male #1] 'No, no.' Football is an island of direction in a world of circumspection. In it, a man is asked to do a brutal and difficult, yet clear thing. To move a ball from one end of the goddamn field to another. [laughing] 'He either does it or he gets out' with no rhetoric. There's nothing vague. This crystal purity. That is football. [birds chirping] [car honking] [shouting] [male #1 narrator] Yeah, I know Gifford. Went to college with him. Got to New York, same time he did. That period became the first autumn of my life. In its way, a beginning. [soft music] [customers chattering] [music continues] [thinking] I've been thinking of that ass of yours sheathed in Tyrolean corduroy. Have you really? 'Yes.' And that I might follow it so sheath to some mountain peak. 'Where I would then de-corduroy, de-pant' and de-flower you among the flora. 'Then all the world's colors would come into focus.' And the soft raven down of your...thingamajig. How sweet. [customers chattering] I don't know why, I wanted to be with you. What do you do? I'm writing a book. I wanna tell you of the night. [female #1] 'And I want to help you.' Hey buddy, will you stop staring at my date? What? Your-your date? I wasn't staring at your date. Don't give me that. You've been staring for the last 15 minutes. Now, that's what I'm talking about. Will you cut it out? [male #3] 'Well, I think that's disgusting.' You're very beautiful, Esmeralda. Thank you. I'm Dr. Horatio Penis. Pony? P-E-N-I-S. My friends call me Whore. What do you do? 'I'm a surgeon.' Mostly cancer cases. [coughing] I've been told to give it up. What's wrong? Nothing, I just have an important operation in the morning. I'm not a surgeon. [guitar music] [Fred] 'Somewhere, something went wrong.' 'For months I did nothing, just lay stretched down in Davenport' I don't know how much time passed. Finally, my mother suggested, I come here to the institution. How about your father? I loved my father. He was a great man. He lived well. He played well. And he died well. Loved your father? Yes, loved. We never shook hands. I always kissed him. Do you dream very much? Oh, God, yes. Gold mines in El Dorado, merchant ships moored at Cadiz. 'Aseptic blondes in Copenhagen.' 'Golden maladoes in Port Saeed.' I'm aware of your intelligence quotient, Mr. Exley. 'You're only making fun of yourself.' [sighs] I also dream of rape and murder. Starlets and beauty queens puckering their lips at you from the magazine sections of the Sunday papers. Wearing bikinis and quoting Tolstoy. I dream of raping them and flogging them to death with a truncheon at the precise moment of orgasm. And then what? Then I move on to book review section. [birds chirping] Hello, Patience. [Patience] 'Hello, Fred.' Haven't seen each other for ages. How'd you know I was in the booby hatch? Because you wrote to me. I did? How is Toronto? Fine. You mean, you-you drove all the way down here to see me? Yes. I remember you as being a lot prettier. You.. I've never been pretty, Fred. Sure you have. Got a cigarette? [coughing] Thanks. Tell me, what's it like here? It's the only place in America where people throw precise, well defined shadows. It sounds like a good place to be. As long as the sun is shiny. Do you still like to watch football? God, you really do have a memory, don't you? You must remember what a horny bastard I was, when I was out there. So, why did you come down here, anyway? Nobody has written me a 34 page letter before. Well, there's not much else to do around this goddamn place except sit with the TV set and scratch. Thirty-four pages, huh? Are you allowed to leave? Maybe we could go out somewhere. No. There is nothing you can do for me. 'Not a damn thing.' [Patience] 'I wish I could.' [banging] Maybe I better go? Yeah. I guess you better. Listen.. come back some time, will you? I 'm sorry. I-It's just a bad day, I guess. There's nothing wrong. It's just that you're outside and I'm in. Okay? [Fred] 'But after about a month without a drink' 'my senses become unbearably acute.' 'And I find myself almost clairvoyant' having insights into places I just as soon not go. I never drank for boldness or charm or wit. Alcohol was a depressant to check the mental acceleration produced by being sober. I had to fuzz the edges. Ha. What the hell did you think he's here for? Dandruff? How do you get out of this place? How do you beat those doctors? Do you realize that everyone here is nuts? You including yourself? I never stopped to consider it. But, of course, that's the one possible redemption in America. What is? To admit you're insane. That's it. That's the way to get out of here. But they know you're nuts. [Fred] 'Sanity is an insane reaction to an insane world.' 'You've to become the man the world wants you to be.' So, artificially you hardly cast a shadow. A creature of empty phrases. But to fit in, you have to hate. You have to learn to hate. And there's as good a person as any. The fucking ping-pong champ of Avalon. Volley for serve. 'Okay.' Your serve. Coming your way, Exley. [male #4] 'Hey!' [clapping] One. 'Nothing.' One all. One-two. One-three. One-four. Oh. Um, coming your way, Exley. Five-one. Eight-one. Twelve-one. It's beginning to sound like a fucking football score. Eighteen-one. Nineteen. Game. Twenty fucking one to fucking one. Every time. [Fred] 'Good game, Fatty.' Goddamn juice and the floor are the same goddamn color. [laughing] That was a good game, those Giants of yours played yesterday, huh? They always play well, doc. Um, did you really know Frank Gifford? I told you, I went to school with him. Yes, I know. You told me that already. Okay...I met him once. - Only once? - That's right. In one of those campus hamburger joints. Mmm. It...it gave me a-a physical sense of pain. I wanted to insult him in someway. I wanted to say, "Listen, you son of a bitch "life isn't all a goddamn football game. "Life is rejection, pain and loss. You won't always get the girl." Suddenly, he was standing, right next to me waiting to pay the cashier. So, I grinned at him. Those hard, mocking, "so you're the big shit" grins, right? I didn't know what I expected him to do. But he just looked at me for a moment like he was trying to place me. Then he smiled, and said hello. Is that all? Doctor, with that smile, whatever he meant by it. A smile he probably wouldn't even remember. He impressed upon me, in my embarrassment that it is unmanly to burden others with one's grief. [violin music] [engine sputtering] - Hi. - Hi. - You okay? - Fine. You sure about that? Yes. Then, why are you sitting there? In a land where speed is a virtue it is a grand, defiant and edifying gesture to sit down in the middle of the road. Do you mind if I stay a while? Be my guest. [engine revving] Ever know a girl named Bunny Sue Allergy? No. I did once know a girl named Geraldine. [laughs] Different girl. Yeah, probably was. [birds chirping] [soft music] [Fred] The first time I saw Bunny Sue. I wanted to bury my teeth, Dracula like into her flanks knowing that she would bleed pure butterscotch. She was the girl next door that grew up one day. The head pom-pom girl, the homecoming queen. Poe's Annabel Lee, Scott Fitzgerald's Daisy. [music continues] She was the dream of commercial America that could sell venereal disease if they could package it. [no audio] I got your letter. It's beautiful. Oh, I'm glad you like it. There is this one thing I especially like. "I am a creature of the grey and the dismal while you are of light and radiance." God, I think that's so pretty. - Did I write that? - Yes. It's okay. I'll accept that. Hm, what are you reading? "Lolita." I bought it at the train station and read it on the way in. All of it? Good heavens, no. There are so many hard words. Have you read it? No. Never. [male #5] 'Here you are, ma'am.' - Thank you. - 'Sir.' - Thank you. - Yes, sir. Bunny Sue? Would you like to ride around central park in a carriage? I really don't know what I wanna do. I only have an hour and a half before my train. Oh. Do you live near here? I kinda have a feeling that what I wanna do involves another person. [clears throat] What's wrong? Nothing, my ear lobes are sweating, that's all. [melodic music] - Fred. - Hi. Thank you. You know what I did on the way in? What? I wrote Mrs. Frederick Earl Exley in the dust on the train window. 'Come on.' [music continues] Father gets a new Cadillac every year and mum gets a new TV set every six months. They've a really perfect marriage. I can't wait for you to meet them. When can you come out, Fred? [Bunny Sue] Guestroom's right down the hall from mine. [Bunny Sue laughs] 'We don't go to church anymore' 'but mums and poppy always bow their head' for the prayer on TV at night, if they're still awake. I've been brought up to make a man happy. That's what mummy does. And that's what I want. More than anything else in the world, Fred. Just to make a man happy. [clopping] [soft music] [crying] What's the matter? Fred.. ...I'm not a virgin. [upbeat music] [music continues] [horse neighing] I'm sorry. In every book I ever read, the hero was so goddamn virile I didn't think it was possible to...fail. [sighs] "The Frigid Male." Don't worry, Fred. I like this book the best. Have you read them before? No, I like the cover. It's on fetishes. Oh, Christ. Mother fucking, brother sucking, sister shagging. What comes after that? [sighs] Rape. Rape. Rape! No. You-you're supposed to cringe. 'Be terrified!' [sighs] It's hopeless. It's not like I imagined. 'Whatever happened to the days' when you sat in the back seat of a car with the windows all fogged up.. ...and chewed on a girl's lower lip. And slowly, slowly worked your way down until finally you reached those wool sweatered nipples. I remember that because it was like trying to draw a juice from ear muffed oranges. Fred, I know what's wrong. You do? We haven't been...sanctified. Sanctified? By the home, by my parents, by marriage. [fast-paced music] [horn blowing] [violin music] [drum beats] [orchestral music] - Fred, how about a drink? - Oh, great. - Like a beer? - Anything. - 'Good.' - So, he drinks. [chuckles] How long have you known Bunny Sue? What do you mean? 'How long have you known each other?' Oh, not long. Hey, there's a golf game on TV. You wanna see it? Oh. Yeah, sure. [man on TV] 'Or play it safe by driving short down the middle.' 'Now, if you wind up in those trees, let me assure you..' - How about that reception, huh? - It's terrific. Certain days, I can pick up...everywhere. [man on TV] '...there just is no room' 'to see the green through those trees.' 'Now, the 14th hole is probably the prettiest on this course..' [laughing] That goddamn wink of his is driving me crazy. Why? I.. It's like he's saying you getting into my little blonde dumpling, huh-uh? You know, don't you, that inevitably there's gonna be that man to man talk. Oh, Fred. Come on outside for a minute, will you? [orchestral music] [music continues] Somehow, I got the impression that this gadget was a substitute for accomplishment to him. But it turned out to be mums who inflicted the concept of failure on him. But by that remarkable viciousness of which the American mom's mind is capable she laid her own physical shortcoming as a woman squarely on the guy's penis. You see, Mr. Exley my husband had a glandular deficiency. So, I had seven miscarriages beforeBunny Sue. You could understand why she's so important to me. Oh, tell me about yourself. Well, there's nothing much to tell really. Well, what about your job? Well, at present I'm in public relations for the Pennsylvania Railroad. Uh, PR for the PR. [laughing] Ah-ha. Do you go to church, Mr. Exley? Oh, yes. Protestant of Piscable, high church. Oh, good! We're Piscables too. It's so much easier on everyone if a girl can live the life she's used to. Her father and I are very active in the country club and I, the bridge club, of course. She's been surrounded with love and intelligence. Her poppy and I have been members of book of the month club for 18 years. Isn't it, dear? I just loved the Caine Mutiny, didn't you? - I did indeed. - Dear. [clinking] Brandy? Oh, yeah. You don't know what it was like, Mr. Exley. What? Those last months before Bunny Sue was born. I had to lie down the whole time with a hammock holding my hips up. [Poppy] Here we are. [Moms] 'Well, pour it, dear.' [Poppy] 'Oh, yeah.' Hi, Fred. Hi. Come on, in. Come here. We barely had a chance to see each other. I know. How do you like my parents? They're the salt to the earth. I knew you'd love them. The four of us get along so well. And they love you too, Fred. You know what mum said? Hmm? She said Poppy will build us a house on any lot in Heritage Heights we choose. Oh, Fred, we're gonna be so happy. Yeah. Except for one small thing. [slow-paced music] Fred. 'Fred?' [crying] As much as I would like to been consumed by that world of wet velvet certain images kept running through my mind. [band music] [music continues] You know how Bunny Sue wound up? [male #6] 'No. How?' She married a PhD sports writer for Time magazine? [both laughing] Boy, isn't that sort of a contradiction in terms? For Bunny Sue or Time magazine? [laughing] [coughing] You alright? Mmm. I-I have this heart thing. It's.. Am I gonna die, doctor? No. It's a heart attack, isn't it? You've been drinking too much. You mean to tell me booze can do this? You'll find out when you come here with stomach hemorrhages when your liver gives up. Name? Fredrick Earl Exley. 'Did your father or mother ever have any..' '...any chronic internal condition?' 'Weak heart, lungs, etcetera?' Yes. My father. 'What was the matter with him?' [slow-paced music] [music continues] [male #7] 'This week shall be proclaimed Earl Exley week in Watertown' 'by proclamation of the mayor' 'in honor of the captain of the best sunny pro football team' between Chicago and New York City. [applause] [Earl Exley] I...I love playing ball. I played ball here since I was twelve. And I...love this town. So, I'm, uh, I'm a happy man. I don't know many words to say in public, except.. ...win. [applause] [coughing] [coughing continues] [Earl Exley] 'I must express my gratitude to my town.' 'for the Earl Exley benefit game played last week.' 'For me or any of mine, forget this noble gesture' it would be a sacrilege in its barest form. It is important that you remember that. [coughing] [coughing continues] [Earl gasping] Now, I have so much... love of my family. 'It seems..' '...next to impossible to die.' It was that qualification next to impossible that I didn't like. And perhaps, my anger manifested itself into being hung up at my father's death at 40 of lung cancer. But not anymore. See, I know that he had as happier life as any man can who's performed his most poetic feats before 30. I realize now, that my father didn't win everything. Hm-mmm? Not that my own dreams of fame weren't real. They were. Unlike those goldmines in El Dorado and the aseptic blondes of Copenhagen. Yes. Ah, and your rejection of Bunny Sue. Well...my inability to couple with Bunny Sue was not necessarily with her. But...more what she represented. Those aspects of American life that I...couldn't successfully live with. Had I mingled with that womb I never would have found the strength to walk away again. So, you see my glands knew what my brain didn't. Good. You'll be getting out of here very soon, Mr. Exley. [upbeat music] [Patience] 'When you going to get out..' ...of Avalon? I don't know. Christ! I don't even know what I am. I saw my chart once and it either said "paranoid schizophrenic" or "schizophrenic paranoid." I was trying to read it upside down. 'So I-I can't even remember what it said I was.' What you going to do? I really don't know. Look...Patience, I'm crazy, I am a drunk and I don't know who I am. But these Sundays have given me the luxury of loving. Fred, I live alone in a very large apartment. 'But if you want to move there, come.' 'And there will be only one condition.' What's that? That you make a lot of noise. You get the American football games on television? Commercials too. [music continues] Exley? I-I am sorry, excuse me, but.. You'll be getting out of here soon. I was wondering if you could, uh, do me a favor? Sure, Sam, what is it? Well...could you phone my sister in Rochester and.. ...ask if I could come and live with her? So I can get out of here. Sh-she's the last chance I got. Sure, Sam. I'll call her. Give her and the kids my love and.. Well, try to impress on her.. ...you-you know, the...the urgency. Okay, Sam. They have a, have a spare room over the garage. Are you going to go to this girl? No. Not now. It's pride I guess. Maybe later, when I might appear in an aura of more presentable splendor. [phone ringing] [woman on phone] 'Hello?' Hello, is this Mrs. George Deal? 'What?' 'Turn down that TV!' 'What did you say?' Is this Mrs. George Deal? 'Yes, it is.' Uh, my-my name is Fred, uh, is, uh, Earl Fredricks. I am an attorney at law. I met your brother-in-law recently when I was visiting a client of mine at Avalon. 'Oh, my brother, Sam. How is he?' Well, you see, your brother and I were discussing the possibility of his getting out of Avalon. 'Oh, I see,' Now, it really doesn't involve anything more than just your signature. 'Uh-huh.' And that you would feed him occasionally and give him bus fare to look for work. 'Oh, I see.' 'Excuse me a minute.' 'George!' 'George. George!' 'There's a man on the phone, a lawyer, about Sam.' 'Sam!' [George] 'Hello, Christ, I'm in the bathroom. I'm on a can.' - Uh, Mr. Deal? - 'Yeah.' Ex-excuse me for interrupting your.. Your brother-in-law and I were discussing the possibility of his getting out of Avalon. And now, the state takes the position-- 'Well, he's a no good mess' 'and I couldn't have him in the house.' But-but he said you had an apartment over the garage. 'I couldn't have him around the kids.' 'And that's all there is to it.' Wh-what do you think about it, Mrs. Deal? After all, he's your brother. [George] 'Well, it doesn't make any difference.' This is my house and that's all there is to it.' - Well, why? - 'Because this is myhouse!' Your house? Listen, George, you son of a bitch we're talking about a man's life! A man who couldn't do your kids anymore damage than the goddamn television set has already done, you shit! 'Where the hell, where the hell are you calling from?' Oh, flush, George. Flush! May you both rot in hell. [phone rings] Yes? [female #2] 'Would you deposit 35 cents for additional time, please?' No, I won't because you put an extension phone in George's bathroom. 'But, sir, you made the call.' 'Sir?' [guitar music] [male #8] 'Here's the booze, TV. Plumbing monuments in there.' The kitchen's in there. Counselor, you're the best friend a guy could have. Oh, don't worry about it. Every lawyer needs a friend or two from childhood. Yeah, well, I won't stay long. I just need some time to think about Patience and kinda get used to being on the outside again. Stay as long as you like, okay? If you need any money, just ask. Alright. It's good to see you again, Fred. I'll see you later. Everything in the house is yours. [sighs] [female #3] Hi. [female #3] 'Ah!' [woman laughs] Hi. God love him, the counselor still believed in one thing that I no longer did. The consoling power of fornication. Hi, Fred, sorry to disturb you. That's alright. This is my boss, he has to be back at the office before lunch. What can I do for you? 'They need the room.' Fred? Oh! - Reading Lolita, eh? - Yeah. Good book. 'Sexy!' You still reading Lolita actually? Hey X, why don't we go down to roadhouse and grab ourselves a couple of broads? Huh, no, thanks. They're great down there. They all had abortions. Not today, Studds. Figured how to explain why you're here doing nothing? You hiding out for somebody? You'd like me to take care of 'em? No thanks, Studds. I'm sorry to disturb you, but I forgot my book. Still reading "Lolita?" Yeah, it's all in hard words. It never occurred to anyone that I was reading the book for the fourth or fifth time and was simply drunk on Nabokov marvelous prose. - Hello, mummy. - 'Is this really you?' Yeah, it's me. 'Why did you leave so suddenly?' I had to get out of town for a while. No, I'm alright. Now, don't worry. 'Where are you?' Mummy, call Charlie and tell him that I'm just thinking things through and things are just gonna be okie-dokie and tell him that I love him 'and that I miss him and that I want him.' Mummy, I'll be back on Friday. I'm not gonna miss my own wedding. Oh, it will be okay. I'd come to expect almost anything at the counselor's. Anything that is except Mr. Blue. Somehow he got me moving again. Freddie boy, I just knew you were...a muff diver. Freddie baby, do you know when I first started in the aluminum siding business. I had a big black convertible it's about a damn mile long. I still got it. But, then, I had this driver. Old Seedy. And he had a mouth full of gold teeth. Would shine out of his black face and would blind you. And Old Seedy and me would just drive around. [laughs] Now, Old Seedy, he'd drive me up to the curb then he would hop out and he'd open the back door. And then he'd move his ass up here and he'd roll out a big red carpet for me to...walk it on. [laughs] And then I'd walk into this house with full of these luscious housewives with little-little housecoats. 'And all of them prancing around' and scratching themselves, and chain smoking. And just aching to get laid. Aluminum siding, huh? Those were the days, Freddie boy. Those were the days. Well, my problem now is that I can't find any good canvases. The kids nowadays, you know, can't find anybody with any style or class or that kinda old fashioned charm. But you've got it, Freddie boy. Youhave got it! You think so? I'm sure of it. Aluminum siding. Come on, I'll show you something. Come on. [band music] Freddie. You do it! Get in there and do it boy! That's my boy! Victory! Victory! Ha! Don't forget. Save some. [laughs] For me. Hello, I'm selling aluminum siding-- No, I don't want any. Okay. - Hello, I'm selling-- - 'Don't want any.' Hello, I'm selling aluminum siding. Okay. [music continues] Hello, I'm selling aluminum siding. I found one. Oh, good! Let's get moving to that muff and take a dive! - Uh, one thing. - Yes? - She's blind! - Blind? Well.. No, it's fairly recent. They thought that it was because of an early childhood disease, but.. ...lately they seem to think that it could be psychosomatic. Do you think that I'm nuts, Mr. Blue? Uh, no. No, ma'am. No, no. No, we-we're all a little like that. Well, that's very good of you to say that. Yeah, we'd like to talk to you about siding, if we may. Well, yes, I'd like to hear about that. Yes, well, your-your home has been chosen as the lucky one in the neighborhood to receive a personal visit from Mr. Blue. Oh, honest to good-- Yes, and, uh, aluminum siding will protect your home against rot, corrosion and various harmful insects. Oh, yes, I-I'm sure that it will. Yes, and American Aluminum Siding is positively the best. Comes in all sorts of shapes and-- - Can I have one of those? - Oh, sure! Help. Help! [screaming] [screaming continues] [tires screeching] You know.. ...cigarettes are not dangerous to one's health cigarettes just kill you fuckin'dead. Freddie, come to my house for dinner. I want you to meet Debbie. I gotta tell you about Debbie. Now, Debbie teaches girls gym. [sniggers] She doesn't like me to drink or smoke or anything 'but, oh ,she's a great girl.' 'I've been shackin'up with her for two years.' We've got adjoining apartments. Oh-h-h, how I'd like to dive into that muff. [stairs creaking] [Mr. Blue] 'Aah.' - You've been drinking. - Aw, hon-- And you've been smoking too. Hmm? Hmm? Mr. Blue and I don't drink. But I keep liquor for our guests.. Oh. ...locked up. [chucking] Don't put so much salt on that, it's bad for the kidneys. [Debby] 'And drink that tiger's milk.' And try to keep that old unexercised body 'from going to flab.' Unexercised? Unexercised? Ha ha ha. That's the last thing. Yeah. You ask Freddie if I don't exercise. - You tell her that I exercise. - He exercises a lot. 'He really does, the back flips' front flips, push ups, all sort of stuffs. Well, in between drinks, of course. [coughing] I'm in good shape. I-I'm really in good shape. He is. He's in excellent shape. Alright. You don't think so? I'll prove it. I'll prove it. Out of the way, boy. Here we go. You never could do this. Ah! Little weasel. Hey, wait a minute. You don't think he's gonna stay here, do you? Oh, come on, be reasonable, will you? You get him out of here. Look, your private life's your own business. I am not gonna say anything to the PTA about it. I don't care what that little weasel told you. He doesn't stay here! [thud] [guitar music] Tell me, whatever happened to Mr. Blue? - He died. - What of? Crushed skull, electrocution or flak. [laughing] All three of them? Hm. Just one. [upbeat music] He'd been utterly corrupted. He was a mock epic hero of his country. [shouting] [Fred] 'The natives seemed particularly vindictive today.' 'What the hell are they so upset about?' They probably think you're a "think o'liberal, staging a sitting." Huh. No? It is not my call to sit on cold concrete getting piles for peace. What is your call then? Covering up those white lies? I like to think 'it's an ability to combine words well.' [typewriter scroll clicks] I live in Toronto, Ontario. With my wife, I live in Toronto, Ontario. Which is very close to the United States. [typewriter clicking] Hello, writer. I'm just gonna look. I'm sorry. I didn't want you to see until it's finished. You'll lose the flow of the text. I know. I won't be long. Off to uh, preserve sacred institutions? No, no. I'm not marriage counseling today. I'm going to the doctors. Don't get too tired, eh? I'll take a break soon. Well, where's Cristy the third? He's on the couch. I love you. I'm sure glad you can afford a husband. Bye. I'll miss you. [door shuts] [sigh] [sigh] [TV remote clicks] Oh, my God. It's Laura Bleasdale. 'The emancipated American woman.' 'She of the crows feet above the eyes.' 'Suffering in self indulgence.' Un-remitting menstrual pains. Chronic constipation and acute sexual frustration. Tell us, Laura. How are you today? [woman on TV] Hi, Matt. How are you? Oh. I'm fine, except for the..mmph. You know, it's my time. Well, your time is my time. Ha, ha, ha. No, I guess, I'm not pregnant. In fact, I'm thinking of getting my tubes tied off. Oh, I know, menopause is coming all too soon. Breach positions. Cancer of the breasts, cancer of the cervix, rectum. 'Fatty livers, dandruff, bowels.' Yes. No. - 'No.' - Ha, ha, ha. Yes, hardening of the arteries diabetes, cataract, hemorrhoids. Hernia, diphtheria, heart burn, obesity strokes, heart attacks, coronary occlusions. [sigh] And I don't know what I'm going to do about Webster's mistress. Oh, don't worry about her. She talks a lot and cries a lot. But not one inch of carnal knowledge have I seen. See, what you should do-- oh, Christ, there he is. 'Christy.' - Hello, Webster. - Hello, Laura. How is...she? Let's behave calmly without hurting each other 'if we can, Laura.' I don't know what I'm going to do about this. [Fred] 'Oh, for Christ's sake, Webster.' Why don't you get mad once and kick her in the crotch? Yell for Christ's sake. [Fred] 'You think that the voice under control' 'is the voice of civilization.' 'She is a witch.' And to break her spell you've got to wave your magic wand. [intense music] [woman on TV screaming] [screaming continues] Go, Webster. [Webster screaming] Yes, Webster. Hurry up! [screaming continues] Hurry up! She is gonna get away. [music continues] [Webster] 'Ah!' That's magnificent, Webster. Now, keep your motivation alive and bury it. Ah! Webster. Now, let's have some real organ music. [organ music] How is that for a climax, Harriet housewife? [woman moaning] [slow instrumental music] [click] [sighs] [bells ringing] [foot steps] - 'Hi, honey. I'm home.' - Hi. Back already? 'Yeah.' How did the day go? Oh, I don't know. Lots of pages. I'm just too close to it you know? - Would you want a back rub? - Yeah. Hm. - That feel better? - Mm-hmm. - Fred? - Hm. I went to the doctor, you know? Oh, did you patient? Yeah, I did. Well, what did he say? He said that the baby is due in March. Aw! [coughing] Another vodka presbyterian, please. My wife's gonna have a baby, Joe. Yeah? Congratulations. Yeah, that is the trouble with birth control and there's always immaculate conception. Have you ever thought about killing yourself? Nope, never have. W-well, how would you go about it? No idea. Did you know you had your shirt on inside out? What is it? I want you to sit down for a minute. What's the matter? Patience, I... went to see a doctor. Who? Jonathan Sergruet. He's a...cancer specialist. What did he say? 'That's what I'm trying to tell you.' See, he took some X-rays in my lungs and he got 'em back today. And apparently there's some kind of congenital weakness. I guess, it's from my father. Anyway...he says he's gonna have to operate immediately. Fred? It's gonna cost 2500 dollars and he...he wants a 1000 in advance right away. Tsk. [saxophone music] I kno-I know it's an awful lot of money. [saxophone music continues] But well, he's-he's supposed to be one of the.. Fred. [sobs] Let me take you to a doctor, right now. Okay. Hexley, what the hell do you want? - Don't you know? - No. I want the destiny that's grand enough for me. Like, Michael Angelo's God reaching out to Adam. I want to reach across the ages and stick my dirty fingers into posterity. Tsk. But I can't because I'm dying of lung cancer. Look , the X-ray-- I don't care, what the X-rays show. I know what I have in my chest. Okay, I won't argue with you. - How long have you got? - I don't know. - Six months? - Maybe. Okay, so you've got six months. So? I want a 1000 words a day. [door closes] Alright, you son of a bitch. A 1000 words a day, huh? You'll get 2500. 5000! Not that you'll think that I'm a writer. Ha, ha! No, you just know that trying to adjust a nut to society his rebellion should take on some former morale. Alright. So, I'll write. [music] That's pretty good actually. Thanks. Yeah, pretty good. [music continues] That's pretty bad. What? That's pretty bad. What do you know anyway? Fucking cohorts. [music continues] - How's the case? - What? - How are the prints? - Why? What do you want? Oh, isn't that, Frank Gifford? Have your day, Gifford. In a matter of months I'll more famous than you are. [typing continues] [music continues] [Esmeralda] Fred. The boys are here to say goodnight. [baby crying] Well...daddy will come and say goodnight to you later on, okay? [floor boards squeak] I-I-it's not necessarily the end of the book, Joey. It's just that nothing more is coming. And I suddenly feel very vulnerable. [heavy footsteps] Mayor...on. Mayor...off. Mayor...on. Mayor...off. May-ay-ayor.. [rustles paper] [band music] [spectators cheering] [commentator #2] 'If he was caught on the blind side of that play.' 'Oh, that'll give me a headache, you know.' [commentator #3] 'There was no way he could see that one coming.' 'If the faces of those around him tell us anything' 'that Gifford may be very badly hurt.' 'Yeah, he's not moving at all.' 'He-here comes the stretcher from the side lines.' [man on TV] 'Tonight, Frank Gilbert. One of the all time greats' 'of football lies in hospital with a concussion.' 'This is the play that may've brought to an end' 'one of the greatest careers..' That's it. It's over. It's alright. He'll be alright. It's just a concussion. No, it's more than that, Esmeralda. [Esmeralda sighs] I don't understand. Couldn't understand, yeah? You're just too young. Why don't you watch where the hell you're going? 'Hey, fuck.' Hey, mother lover. What'd you say? You heard what I said, watch where you going. You almost knocked us in this street. - Let's go. - Listen. Apologize for that remark. You first, you apologize for knocking us in the street. - Come on. - 'Okay.' I'm sorry we inadvertently bumped against you. - Now? - Now, get outta here. - Man, do you really want this? - Come on, come on. [opera music] [Esmeralda] 'No!' [Esmeralda cries] Stop it! [music continues] [Esmeralda] Why? [Fred] Why? [Fred coughs] Because, Esmeralda. I'm beginnin' to realize that it is my call. Not like my father, who heard the roar of the crowd. It is my call, to sit in the stands with most people and applaud the accredits of others. And it's my fate, my destiny, my end to be a fan. [sighs] [sighs] 'You're leaving?' Yeah, I gotta get some place before dark. Hey, do you want a ride? I'm goin'the other way. [bike revving] Did you know that Keats was dead at 26? No, I didn't know that. Later. [bike revving] [band music] [spectators cheering] [music continues] Right. Don't you wish it were real? I mean, don't you wish it could just go on forever. [drum beats]
