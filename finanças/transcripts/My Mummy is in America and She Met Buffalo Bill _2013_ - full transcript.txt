My Mother is in America She met Buffalo bill Stand! I found him in the schoolyard. He was lost. Go and sit down over there. Fine! Girls and boys, for those who don't know me, I'm Mr Ferret, headmaster of the school. First Grade is an important class. During this year, you'll learn to read, write and count. I'll remind you of three essential qualities of every good student... Work.... perseverance... enthusiasm. And discipline! And discipline. Be seated. Quietly! Where was I? Venert Pascal...? Present. Let's hope that this year you'll be doing better at spelling and sums. No. Father's profession? He sells big cars. That didn't change either. And your mother? Secretary. And our little latecomer... what's your name? - Jean Regnault. - Didn't hear you. - Jean Regnault. - Father's profession? Boss. Does your father own the Regnault cannery? Carrots and salsify... is that him? - Yes. - We say "Yes, Ma'am." Yes, ma'am. Boo to canned stuff! With a boss for a husband, I imagine that your mother doesn't work? Yes... she's a... Yes... She's a secretary. Yoo-hoo, Jean! Your mum's pretty. That's not my mum. She's my nanny. Hi Yvette! So Jean, tell us... How's your new teacher? Pretty? No, she's super ugly... She doesn't look nice. She's called "Whistle", because she orders us with a whistle. She says that with her method, we'll be reading by year's end. She sounds conscientious. And you made a lot of friends I guess? Yes, heaps. We don't care! We don't care! I was at the park and I played ball! Nya Nya Nya! Stop it, Paul! Stop squabbling! Otherwise, no iced chocolate. Gentlemen, how are these bowls? Empty. To make a nice iced chocolate... ...we need... Milk! But that's not all! But that's not all! We need... Chocolate! But that's not all... We need... To freeze it! But most of all, you need to know how... To count! One... two... three! It sticks. How do you do it? It's magic! Come on children... sit up! When's Daddy home? He'll be home late. No point in waiting for him. Why is he always late? You know he's very busy at work, Paul. He says he's almost a prisoner in his own factory. Daddy! - Good evening. - Good evening, Yvette, boys. I made a gratin. Well, maybe it's a bit cold. Sorry. No matter. You know, it was Jean's first day at school. So it was! His teacher gave them a list. He has to have a grey shirt for next week. I didn't think they existed anymore. What do we have here? This is a delicious gratin. - You're a blue-ribbon chef, Yvette. - Thank you, sir. Off you go to bed now, kids. Yvette will tell you a story. What do 3 apples plus 6 apples make? Me Ma'am, me Ma'am! Mister... Nourdine! Apple stew, Ma'am. My ears! A donkey's ears! In the corner... hands on head! Next time you'll be off to the headmaster! How many are 3 apples plus 6 apples? What, ma'am? Did you want to say something? No, Ma'am. - You! - 9 apples, Ma'am. And if I were to add 4 pears? Why didn't you want to play with me at school? Look what you did to me with that rubber band, it's all red! Very well... I'll make you my hair-brusher, servant! You're hurting me! - Sorry! - You say "Sorry, Your Majesty". And don't forget you're my servant and I'm the princess. And I can throw you in the dungeon for your insolence. I don't want to be a servant anymore! Silence, varlet... I must be beautiful! Tonight I'm invited to the ball! You're not invited. You're too small! It's not true! I'm at big school now! But you're in the infants' class. I can't wait to be able to write to my mother. Yeah, she's traveling. What shall we play? Michelle! Come and help us! See you. Michelle! When I call you, you come immediately. You lazy good-for-nothing! Here, live from the auto show... ...visitors were able to admire the new DS models... ...especially the white convertible, a model for the young at heart. Still with the hydro-electric suspension, offering unequaled comfort..." Those damned dogs! Daddy! Jean played with Michelle this afternoon. That's not true! Jean, I've told you, I don't like you hanging around those neighbours. Michelle's dad, was in jail, wasn't he, Daddy? Paul, we don't talk about such things. Why? Not true? Listen, it's none of our business. After the news with Leon Vitrone, you can spend the evening with the comic... Daddy... Yvette will tell you a story. But there's no school tomorrow. Anne.... my sister Anne... Do you not see anything coming? Anne replied... I see nothing but the rising sun and the green grass. That's when Bluebeard appeared with his big knife... Continued tomorrow... Off to beddy-byes! Mummy... is he going to kill her? Paul, you know I'm not your mummy, I'm your nanny. You're our nanny. Off to sleep! Goodnight, children. Heck, Daddy's chair's hiding everything! Move! Let me see! He stopped my marble. It's a foul. I go again. Don't give me that! It didn't go in the hole. - Can I play with you? - Depends. You got marbles? - No. - Well buzz off! - I'll go again. - No, it's Alain's turn. Hey, big boy... want some marbles? I can fix you up. OK, but I don't know how to play. No worries. I'll teach you. Come on. The first to puts his marble in the hole, wins all the marbles. It's dead easy. Got it? Hey, you're pretty good! My turn. Darn it! I missed it too. The last one. Just a lucky shot... Sorry about that. Want to try again? I can lend you some more. Tomorrow for sure, eh? Don't forget. You owe me 20 marbles. 20 marbles! Yeah... that's how it goes! Jean! Jean! I've got a postcard for you. For me? Yes! And it's your mum who wrote it. My mum? Look... Warning! Do not tell anyone about this card. It's a secret. No one? But why did she send the card to you? Well, just so nobody knows about it. "My dear John, my darling..." "I'm in America." Well, she's lucky. "There are cowboys everywhere, they take care of cows and shoot pistols." I like Indians better. "I also like Indians better." "I met one of them in a supermarket." "His name was Dog Cloud." That's a funny name. "He makes rain fall by dancing." Last night, I saw a Buffalo Bill show that you would have liked a lot. I hope that school is going well. I think a lot about you and I give you a big kiss. Your mum who loves you. What's that? It's mountains in America. You know, like in westerns. And in front is Buffalo Bill's horse. - Michelle! - I'll keep it, it's safer. Michelle! Daddy! Daddy! What? Michelle got a postcard from... Who from? From Mummy. Listen to me, Jean. I've told you to stay away from the factory. Now off you go! Coming Jean? Hello Mr Regnault, I was expecting you. How are you? Hello Mr Venert, I'm fine, thank you. Good to hear. You'll see we have some very nice models to show you. - Well, I'm counting on it. - This is your lad? That's funny... You know our boys are in the same class? Come here Pascal... There's a classmate of yours here. Go up... He must be upstairs in his room. Go on... up you go! Unfortunately he has the same teacher as last year. My boy learns nothing from her. I wonder if I should change schools. You're not with your pal? He's looking for you. Yeah? Where is he? I can make you a special offer on this one, Mr Regnault. I'll throw in the radio-cassette player for free. You don't have something more attractive looking? Hey, Regnault! Are you sure you haven't forgotten something? Your pal seems a bit strange. He's the dunce in class, But he's best at marbles. He beat me, and as well... What? You're still playing marbles in primary school? Tell me Jean, don't you think it's a beautiful car? Do you think Yvette will like it? So, Mr Cannery... hiding? Oh, no! Like at my father's showroom? I couldn't find you. Now you've found me. You got my marbles? You think you can rip me off? Stop it! You're hurting me! You gonna get smart, eh? I'm waiting. I don't have any. You gotta ask your father for money to buy some, OK? I don't dare. Now you owe me THIRTY marbles. I think you're catching a cold. It's nothing. I was playing in the rain. Well, today I'll make you a HOT chocolate. Stop that, Paul! Don't give your germs to your brother. Jean's given me his germs! Hey, kid.... come over here. You must be Paul, eh? No. Jean. Jean, will you do me a small favour? Yvette... What is it? There's a man waiting for you out there. - A man? With a mustache? - Yes. You can watch the gratin in the oven, please? - You know how to keep a secret? - Yes! So I'm counting on you not to tell anyone about the man, okay? Oh yes! I'm sorry, the gratin got burnt. As my father used to say... "Who burns up the oven, burns down the lovin'." What does that mean, Daddy? That cooking a gratin can say a lot. But, no, Yvette... it was fine. You don't miss out cooking-wise. But it WAS a bit overcooked. A tiny bit. Wow! Steel marbles! One steel one is worth at least 10 ordinary ones. - Where did you find them? - I can't tell you. - Do you have a lot? - Yeah, look! 12! Give us some, and we'll be your friend. - That way you can play with us. - Okay. Well, Mr Cannery, have you come to settle your debts? Well, yes. - Show me. How many have you got? - There's 12. Good, give me all of them. What? Steel ones are worth 10 times ordinary ones. This is how I count, Fesdal. Here you are. OK, we're quits. What about us? You promised. Hi, Jean! Want to play? No? You have another card? No. It was me who got it. But I can read it to you. "My dear Jean..." "I am in Africa." "I'm skiing on the snows of Kilimanjaro with friends." "Here, there are lots of amazing animals..." "Giraffes, hippopotamuses, zebu and red ibises. " What's a zebu? It's a cow, but with a hump, like a camel. - And a zibis ? - An ibis. It's a bird, a bit like a pink flamingo, but all red. It's because of the heat. "Kisses, your mum who loves you." - Have you ever skied? - No. I've often skied in Switzerland. I'm going to go there for the holidays. You're so lucky! Yeah. But Dad, why wait here? It's boring. Because Grandma Simone and Grandpa Pierrot live far away. So we each go half the way. Understand ? I don't want to go to their place. Neither do I. I don't want to. Listen, children, Yvette has the right to take a break. Grandma is nasty. And Grandpa has stinky feet. You're not to talk about your grandparents like that. They're happy to have you for the holidays. He's happy to get hold of us when he needs us, that one! Yes, well next time, YOU pick up the phone! Look at that! A convertible! He doesn't deny himself anything. Hold on! We'll give him a surprise. Pierrot... don't you start! Do not worry, I saw this in a movie. They shouldn't be long now. Look out! Burning rubber the Belmondo way. Hang on Simone! It was because of that puddle. My tires are practically new. I'm sorry, should give you a statement. Don't worry. So how much do I owe you? Children, come and get in the car. It's starting to rain. - Want me to help you? - No, no, it'll be fine. Very well. What's crazy is that I didn't get a scratch. Thanks again. I mean, about the children. Paul, look at the mammoth. There are no such things as mammoths. Mammoth breaks prices. Granny breaks wind. Grandpa has stinky feet! Granny breaks wind! "Love is a bohemian child..." I can tell you've been drinking. The children behave themselves? They've been SO good! They clogged the toilet with paper, moved all the furniture, rolled up the carpets and drew on the walls. They even tried to teach the parrot bad words... and here I'm picking up the rice they dropped while searching for cakes in the cupboard. I hope you'll congratulate them. Heck, there are no marbles here! Listen you Regnault boys! I warn you from now on you'll want to behave. Understand? Otherwise it'll be out with the belt! And you won't come camping with us. Please Grandma... Marbles! Marbles please! What, do you think I'm made of money? Grandma, I want this sailor-top! Come along now! Say yes! Say yes, please! I don't have a penny. Please, Grandma! Well, you can stay there then! Grandma! Grandma! Poor baby! You want to stir up the whole neighborhood? Help! Help! This can't be happening! Grandpa's socks! Paul! Where are you? He's not there. I wonder where he could be hiding! Surely not in the wardrobe?! Some chocolates! They're super yummy! I don't believe it! I said you were not to come in our room! You are really unbearable! It's not our fault. We just wanted to play. And you've been searching! Who is it in the photo, Grandma? Is it Mummy when she was little? Yes, it's your mummy. So where are the chocolates? That's you Paul, with your mummy and daddy. You can see his wee-wee! That's not true! That was on their wedding day. Isn't it a beautiful dress she's wearing? You know your mummy did love you very much. But she still loves us. Of course she loves you. So... Did you have fun at your grandparents? No! Oh, they gave Jean a sailor-top. But I got nothing. I'll buy you some sweets. Go, go get your brother... Then it'll be yummy time. "Dear Jean, I'm in Brazil..." "The beaches are very beautiful and the water is as warm as in a bathtub." No... I'm swimming, I'm swimming! "Yesterday I went for a hike in the Amazon jungle." "I met some little marmosets, who tickled me." "I saw some macaws." They're parrots, this big. "And then a beautiful toucan of every colour." "I slept with sloths." They sleep hanging upside down from a branch. - Like this? - Yes. "You can't swim in the rivers because of the crocodiles and feet-eating piranhas." We're in danger... I hear a strange noise. There! There is something moving! Be careful... a crocodile! Looks like you're a marmoset. Marmosets eat leaves. I don't want to be a marmoset! Poor little baby marmoset, alone in the forest. I'll protect you. No, I'm not a baby. I'm a tiger. There is no tigers in the Amazon, there are jaguars. Alright, I'm a jaguar! And I'm a poor little gazelle, and you have to catch me! Gazelles can't climb trees! But I'm a special gazelle. There's a toucan! Can we catch it? We mustn't scare it. What are you doing? Oh... nothing. It's going to change my mind. For once, business is not bothering me. Dad, will you ride with me on the dodgem cars? No, with me! I'll ride with... the one who drives the best! You saw Yvette... she's a whiz with cassettes. Mummy you know... ...ever since you left... ...for America... I have trouble talking. You didn't do it on purpose, I don't doubt it. But I'm staying with daddy.. Mother tell me, what is the weather like in this useless country? With Buffalo Bill... With Buffalo Bill... Life is nicer, life is easier... Michelle! What? Did you get a card? What's the matter? You see I'm busy! Did you get a card from Mummy? No... I would've told you. Heck! How about we write to her? - You know how to write now? - No, I'll tell you what to write. I like you Jean, but I've got a ton of work to do. It's a letter for my mum. Can you send it? I'll see what I can do. No... give it back! You two are lovers! - He's just a little squirt! - Why are you blushing? I'm not blushing! Hi pals, can I play with you? We're no pals of yours! You promised to give us some steel marbles. I gave them all to Venert. So play with him. We don't play with kids who break their word. Yeah, a promise is a promise, sworn in spit! Your turn. Your clay marbles are crap! I can get as many steel ones as I want. My father's factory is full of ball bearings! I'll go and find some and you won't get any! Jean... wait! We only said that as a joke. Yeah... just kidding! Anyway, it's too dangerous. My father won't let me in the factory. But we're here. We can all go in together. Yeah, you've got us... We won't let you down. What are you doing there, in my letter box? I just wanted to see if Mummy had answered. I'm the one she writes to, and it's me who reads the postcards. Understand?! But I'm starting to learn to read, too. You can't read, you're just a baby. These are bills for my father. Want them? No... I'm not a baby! That one with my eyes closed! Who is it. My pals. Can I go play football with them? Sure, but don't be long... It'll be dinner time soon. - Can I come with you? - No, we already have 4. 2 against 2. You can still take your little brother with you. He's always following me around. Try and be nice to him. You like him when there's no one else. We'll be a team. I'll be with my brother. What if we play hide-and-seek? 8,9,10... Coming ready or not! I think we got away. Darn it! It's closed. Come on! I know a secret way. Get a move on! Hurry, before someone sees you! Scared to jump? Chicken! I'll wait for you here. I'll be the lookout. I told you we shouldn't bring him. Come down... Hurry up! Charge! I got you! Missed! This isn't funny! Here, take this! I'm out of ammunition... Cover me! Grenade! I'm dead! Look out... a bomb... Take cover! Stop it... we're here to find marbles. Very good, Captain. The bucket's empty! We'll search. Nothing here. Nor here. I've found you. And we thought we were so well hidden! Hey, there are marbles here! Awesome! What are you doing? Look out, we're looking for marbles! Stop...don't be crazy! Hey, look at this, guys! What are you doing here? One for me... Don't worry, we'll have a game. You can win as much as you like. - I'm in. - No way! We're not playing with you. Why? You scared of losing? You want me to swap one steel one for 100 clay ones? Lost interest. So these are clay marbles? You can stick yours! Anyway, we've got more steel ones than you have. Yeah, and we can get as many as we want! Mob of yellow-bellies! Yellow-belly yourself. Wow! The police! Do you know what to expect, if you don't behave? Daddy! What's up? Machinery at the factory has been broken. Serious? A day's work lost, fixing it. Francoise, my accountant saw kids running away. We found that on the ground. It seems they broke machinery just to get some marbles. The police will investigate. What is it, Jean? Nothing. It must be your bed time, boys. So... 3 apples... 3 birds... 6 pears... I'm sorry, Ma'am but my father died. That's alright. 4 lemons and 1 pyramid... All multiplied by 4735... I threw away my marbles. You're crazy! They're investigating the broken machinery. They know that kids did it. Had to throw away the marbles, or get locked up in jail. No, really? Would you like to go to jail? Your turn, boys. Couldn't I keep 2 or 3 as a souvenir? We said all of them. Hurry up! So if the police come here, they'll find our marbles. And we won't go to jail. But they could find his. Yeah! Well... He'll blame you. So we'll all go to jail? What'll we do? - We could buy them off him. - i don't have any money. We have to beat him up, the dirty swine. So we can get the marbles back. Well, it's Mr Cannery with his bunch of carrots! It's alright... We just want to play with you. Changed your mind? Not here... In the empty block behind the school. Alright. But one against one. We'll meet tomorrow at o'clock, if you're man enough. So who's going be handing me an easy win? He's on his way. Mr Cannery? Yeah. He's the one you'll have to beat. Is he your boss? - It's not going in. - Wait! Yeah! Your brother's too good. It's because he never stops training. So Venert... not laughing now? - I'm stopping. - No, you have no right. You're a bad sport! You can't stop now! Right! There are still marbles left. Venert, wait! I propose a super-maxi challenge. What's that? We start over there... and first to put his marble in the hole, wins all the marbles of the other. He's crazy. He only has 5 left and we have plenty. Can't do it! Okay! - With my little finger. - No, Paul, not like that! That's my marble? You see that? It's mine! I've won! Yeah! You had to be clever, eh?! We just have to go back to the factory to look for some. But the marbles don't matter! So why did you want me to win? To throw them away! Why would I win them to throw them away? Give up trying to understand anything. You're a total dummy! You're the dummy! And you're a dill! Do you know what? When we had dinner with Dad, I spat in your blancmange. Yes, well, I put snot in your noodles! You're yucky. I'm not yucky, you are! Goodness, what have you two been up to? You had me worried! Look at the mess you're in! Jean made me eat snot! Look at the guy with a beard talking to the headmaster. I bet he's from the police. He's sure to question us. Our goose is cooked! Hey Mr Cannery... Thank your brother for me. You have to give me back the marbles. Otherwise we go to jail. Truly! You're nuts! See the guy there with the headmaster. He's a police inspector, after the steel marbles I can't tell you more, but you have to believe me! What? Just because he's a cop, I have to give you the marbles? You think I'm stupid? Or hide them, it's all the same! But nobody's to see them, OK? Well then, I think I'd like everybody to see them. Alright? Allow me to interrupt, Mrs Moineau. Stand, children! No... stay seated. Good morning, girls and boys. Some of the students in this grade need to be assessed. So some of you will be interviewed today by Mr Karmasoff here. Good morning, children. So, who will you start with? Venert Pascal. Let's see now... the apples... Why did I put apples? Papa... pipi... popo. That's good. Do you have friends? Do you like having fun with your friends? What's the name of your best friend? Michelle. What games do you two play? I comb her hair. Have you ever seen this kind of drawing? No, never, Sir, I swear. What does this picture make you think of? Of the sea. Of your mother? No Sir... the sea... like the ocean. Do you remember your mum? Of course, Sir. Well, you can go back. I've got all I need. So, am I going to go to jail, Sir? Not a policeman. He's a pedo... podolo... Pedagogue... I know. What's up with Venert? I'm going to get bawled out by my dad. That man's sending me to a special division. What's that? I don't know. A different school. Special division? That could be like a prison. Because of the marbles? No, it's because of my I-Q, he said. What's an I-Q? It's to test your intelligence. Oh yes, intelligence. So obviously he's got a problem. Hello, ma'am... Where's Michelle? She's locked in her room. Could I see her? No, her father's punishing her. She can't go out. But it's important. Okay. You can go see her. But not too long... her father will be back. It's me, Jean. Wait. I'll explain! Don't bother. I understand. No, wait! If I never got an answer from Mummy, it means you never sent my letter. - It's not like that! - You're a liar! I didn't send your letter... because... ...I didn't have her address, understand? You believe me, now? Yes. So, friends again? Is this your room? Sure. What are you doing? - My mum's postcard! - Give it to me! Give my card back, you thief! Give it back, you thief! I forbid you to go out, Michelle! - "Dear Michelle..." - Are you sure? Of course. I can read. It's quite clear. "Dear Michelle...". "...it is summer in Auvergne. It rained then it was hot." "We are waiting for hay. Big kiss, Uncle Rene." I don't understand at all. - Paul! - What? - Do you remember Mummy? - Let me go to sleep. Mrs Moineau, aren't they a bit young for Latin? Mrs Moineau, you haven't answered the Department's questionnaire. And what's this about grey shirts... ...that you've apparently asked the children to wear? What did you ask Santa for? A Meccano set. Yeah, the other one's no good. I want an Red Indian costume. Me, a remote control car, a slot-car system, a walkie-talkie.... What have you asked Santa for, Nouranne? Santa Claus doesn't exist. - Yes, he's real! - He does exist! Of course he exists! - No! - Don't say that again! Santa Claus doesn't exist. Stop it! I'm a Muslim, and we don't have Santa Claus. - Golly! - Tough luck! Poor thing! Wish your parents a merry Christmas and a happy new year from us. Certainly... I'll be sure to. I'm not sure how to tell you... Here goes... Before leaving on vacation, I felt I should tell you some big news. I'm getting engaged. Well... Congratulations, Yvette. Who are you engaged to? To Daddy? No, with Daniel. He's a fireman. And I bet he has a handsome mustache. Did Jean tell you? No, I didn't say anything. It doesn't matter, anyway. No. I saw him at the carnival. You knew about it and didn't tell us? It was a secret, Daddy. A fireman! What's up, Paul? If she gets married, she won't come back. We'll get someone else. I know... There's no one like her. But she'll be back. Come on... I'll make you an iced chocolate like Yvette's. With the magic! It's not how many that matters. But where's Santa going to put our presents? Off to bed, you rascals! He's here! What are you up to here?! What are you doing with my camera? He took a photo of Santa. Santa won't be happy about that. Why? On Christmas Eve, children are not to leave their room. You both know that. Nice photo. You missed him. Santa won't be too mad at you. At least, I hope not. Santa's shoe! Wow, it's exactly what I asked for! Me too! A Red Indian costume I forgot... I asked someone to lunch. - Hello, Guy. - Come in, Francoise. This is Francoise who works in Accounts at the factory. These are my children... Jean and Paul. Yes, I recognize them. It's not us, Ma'am! How isn't it you? No, it's not us. - But you recognize them? - Er... yes. I saw a photo of them in your office. Here... do you like sweets? You don't like sweets? Well... yes. So, what do you say? Thank you, Ma'am. Aren't they shy! I wanted to invite Francoise today, as the factory's most indebted to her. Do you remember when that machinery was broken? Thanks to Francois, we got a very good insurance payout. The breakages turned out to be a good thing. If I knew who did it, I'd kiss them. It was US, Daddy! I certainly suspected you! It wasn't his fault. It was because of me. Even better! Good example for your little brother. And just why did you do it? I promised marbles for my friends. Why didn't you ask? I could have bought you some. I didn't dare and when I wanted to talk to you about it... ...you only thought about your car and if it was going to please Yvette. You never listen to us, or take any notice. You're a prisoner in your own factory. So you feel the same way, do you? Okay, I can understand what's happened, and it's partly my fault. I haven't paid enough attention to you lately, it's true. But now I'll try to spend less time on work and more for my family. But you still need to be punished. Next week you'll help the workers to sweep the yard. Are you going to show me your presents, children? Michelle! What's the baby outfit? It's my Red Indian costume. I told you that you were a baby. I also have a book about animals and a Claude Francois record. That's great. What presents did you get? A new wheelbarrow. Really? Santa Claus hasn't visited here, understand? Are you a Muslim? No. Are you really that dim? Wait. Look at this. Here's a photo of Santa that I took last night, with Paul. Where's Santa? Here! What an idiot you are. Is your father's name Santa? That's his shoe. Santa Claus doesn't exist. Well, do you know something...? No. I suspected it. That's good. Stop, I have something for you. I wanted to return it to you. You can keep it. No, there was a mistake. This is from your Uncle Rene. That's right. So you didn't receive the others? Oh, sure I did! "Dear Jean, I'm in Canada, and it's very cold." "There are caribou everywhere." "I met trappers, and hunted bears. Love from Mummy." Don't you get it? I made the postcards up. Your mother is dead! Jean! No... wait! What is it, Jean? What's upset you? It's Michelle. I told you not to... So, what has she done? She said that Santa Claus... ...doesn't exist. Michelle is wrong, Santa Claus exists. But only when you're a child. When you grow up, he disappears. Now you are big, so for you Santa Claus no longer exists. Let's have a snowball fight! But don't forget Santa still exists for your little brother. I'm counting on you. What's that card? It's a postcard from America. It's Buffalo Bill's horse. It's from Auvergne. Michelle made me believe that Mummy sent it. Why did she do that? But it wasn't possible was it? No. No, it wasn't possible, Jean. Is it like Santa... Now I'm too big to believe it? I didn't see you grow up. You know Jean, we miss your mummy all the time. She misses us, too. You know what children? This summer, would you like to go to America to see real Indians? And we'll go see a Buffalo Bill show? I promise. Can we tell Michelle? Yes, you can. Can I have a go? Can I try it, please? You don't know how... Give it here! Michelle...! Good morning everybody. Be seated. I am Miss Petit, your new teacher. I'm replacing Mrs Moineau, who has retired. Introduce yourselves by your Christian names. Only your Christian names. Subtitles by FatPlank
