THE CIRCLE It is the intention to herein point up that old, yet so valuable, moral... "MAN MAY SELECT A WIFE, BUT HE SHOULD BE CAREFUL WHOSE WIFE HE SELECTS" For twelve generations Cheney Castle had been handed down from father to son. Its first and only scandal was twin beds in the master's chamber, thirty years ago. In the late '90's, Lord Clive Cheney was master of the castle. Hugh Porteous was the best man at Clive Cheney's wedding, and he still was, as far as Lady Catherine was concerned. "But we love each other, Catherine. Nothing else should be considered." "You'll never regret the step we're taking, dear." "I say, Hughie... were you expecting to be shot?" "The former owner used them on a bounder who tried to run away with his wife." Dear Clive, I have run away with Hugh. The baby will be happier with you so I'm leaving you together. I want happiness more than security or position. Try not to be bitter toward me. Catherine. THIRTY YEARS PASSED... The circle of another generation was about complete... and Lady Catherine's son, Arnold, grew to manhood... without her. He married.... and a new mistress presided at Cheney Castle. Elizabeth, Arnold's wife, was just another lovely thing cutting her wisdom teeth on a wedding ring. "Teddy" Luton was a friend, the kind of friend to whom a marriage certificate was a sort of stop-off privilege. "You wonderful creature! You're too beautiful to bury yourself in this place!" "Do you know why I invited you here today?" "Because Arnold's mother, Lady Catherine... and Lord Porteous... are coming here to visit us." "But what has their coming here to do with me?" "I want to see how runaway love wears after thirty years. If they're still happy, then..." Arnold Cheney, Elizabeth's husband. "It's only Alice Shenstone. She's to be our guest, too." "Arnold is unbearably fussy! He keeps this place like a tomb!" "He forgets that we of the present generation are not quite dead... yet." "What a thorough old woman!" "Upon my soul, I wish you hadn't invited my mother! l'm frightfully jumpy!" "Don't be ridiculous, Arnold! Your mother hasn't seen you in almost thirty years!" "... and inviting that man, Porteous, to come here with her, is... positive piffle!" "It's outrageous! Fancy inviting those two here! I'm jolly glad father's in London." "It's dangerous! If he found Porteous here there would be murder, and what not!" "You shouldn't have dragged me along, Kitty! Damned silly idea for me to meet them anyway!" "Mr. Luton... this is Arnold's father." "Never felt so keen about shooting in my life... as I do today." "Father looks frightfully peckish. His trip's tired him." "Hunting is fine in Scotland now, sir. By leaving instantly you could motor to Renham before nightfall." "I'm sure I can get enough shooting to satisfy me... right here." "Tell me... why did Arnold look exactly like a dose of castor oil when I walked in?" "Out with it! Everyone is flustered and embarrassed! What's up?" "Am I boney?" "On the contrary..." "Don't evade my question. What's bothering everyone?" "Lady Catherine is coming here." "And who is Lady Catherine?" "Why... your... your... Arnold's mother." "I wonder what the years have done to Catherine. She was exquisitely beautiful." "Hughie, do you suppose Clive has aged much?" "Hell, yes! Probably he's as wrinkled as a prune!" "She will probably be frail, sweet, quiet and lovely... in black satin and old lace." "I know what she did was wrong... but she loved and she dared." "Who is that young man... who whispers so engagingly?" "Just a friend of mine... and of Arnold's." "Ah, yes... and of Arnold's." "I had a friend like that... Hugh Porteous... dark, handsome, and rather interesting." "Just his kind." "Did you tell him that his former wife and Porteous are coming?" "Well... half. All except that Lord Porteous is coming too!" "Why are you having them come here... to bring the past to life." "I'm curious to see them... to know if it has paid." "They're here!" "They're here!" "Good Lord! Do you think she'll want to kiss me?" "She's your mother, isn't she?" "Arnold, my son! I should have known you anywhere!" "But this is Arnold." "The image of his father! I should have known him anywhere!" "There's a hell of a draught coming from somewhere!" "How are you, Hughie?" "Damned rheumatic if you want to know!" "It's he! My original husband!" "What a moment for you, Clive! You are overjoyed to see me, aren't you?" "Kiss me, Clive!" "May I?" "He's still the same Clive... after all these years, Hughie." "Damn it, sir! Don't guffaw at me! Your teeth are as false as mine!" "Yes, but by gad, sir, mine fit!" "Frail... sweet... quietly lovely!" "Poor Hughie!" "I must confess it, you were a beautiful baby, Arnold, and you've never outgrown it!" "Don't you think Arnold's the image of me?" "You don't understand me, Hughie. You've never been a mother!" "We've got to make the break sometime. Let's go... tonight!" "But, Teddy... su ppose I should come to look like Lady Catherine!" "And if you... should come to be like him, l..." "Damned silly bit of furniture!" "I'm not a bally infant!" "It might sweeten you up a bit!" "You've made a misdeal, darling." "How can I use my hands and ears at the same time?" "... my hair's not naturally this color, you know." "Are you playing bridge... or a mouth organ?" "Must you trump my ace?" "I know something about this game!" "Hell! If you do... it's a secret!" "They talk a splendid game of bridge." "Stop that idiotic chatter!" "Leave him alone! At least he's amiable." "Of course he's amiable. He's never had anything to sour him." "Oh Lord! Now she's going to cry again." "Damn it. Don't breathe down my neck!" "What's got your nerves, Hughie... too many cigars?" "Cigars, hell! You've had it sweet! All I have left... is cigars!" "Let's get away from here! You can't have two husbands under the same roof and keep the damned thing on!" "When I think what I've sacrificed for that man!" "Don't get excited. This is the time to use good judgment." "Good judgment! I'd better use more forceful methods." "Youth! It's just a day of spring... and gone!" "What's the calamity now?" "Don't look!" "You're just as lovely as ever, Kitty." "No drastic measures, my boy. Handle her gently and everything will be all right." "I'm sure Elizabeth loves you. I'll fetch her and you talk with her nicely and quietly." "Do you remember those nights in Venice... the moonlight... the boatmen singing..." "It has lasted, hasn't it... your love for each other?" "It has, my dear... but then, Lady Kitty is a very unusual woman!" "There seems to be something wrong, my dear..." "... but, after all, I'm really quite in love with you... and all that sort of thing." "By Jove, this thing can't go on..." "... you might force me to do something rash... and I'd dislike that frightfully." "I knew we'd fix it, my boy." "Suppose some man were trying to take me away from you. What would you do?" "You have two lovely eyes, Elizabeth." "I'd black one..." "... and close the other!" "You brute!" "I've decided to run away... just as you two did." "You're two young fools... but I don't suppose anything can stop you." "We will be happy together... won't we, Teddy?" "Of course we will, dear... l'm offering you love!" "Teddy, I adore you!" "They're doing the wrong thing... but that's life." "What are you laughing at?" "I'm laughing at Luton! He tried to induce Elizabeth to elope with him..." "Fancy that young whipper-snapper matching wits with me!" "You're a downy old bird, Clive!" "You must find your master! Something terrible has happened! He must know!" "You have two lovely eyes!" "I'm going to black one..." "You brute!" "And close the other!" "Get back in there!" "I'm so glad you saw your mistake... and came back." "This must be our secret, dear. Arnold must never know." "No fools like old fools... unless they're young fools, eh, Hughie?" "Arnold, where have you been? We've been looking for you." "Mr. Luton left hurriedly... and Elizabeth had to see him off. You should treat your guests more courteously!" "It's late, dear, isn't it?" "... in fact, it's time you and I retired." "Come along, my dear." "Dorker... find a new chauffeur, I'm dismissed." "Anything more tonight, sir?" "Pretty fair little joke on someone... eh what, Hughie ?" "Pretty fair? By God, sir... it's perfect!!!" Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
