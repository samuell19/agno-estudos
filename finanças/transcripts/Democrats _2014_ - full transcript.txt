Democracies in Africa... It's a difficult proposition. [all chant] Change! Because always the opposition... [crowds cheer] [Mugabe] ...will want much more than what it deserves. We need a transformation of the system that Mugabe has implemented over the last 30 years. [cheering] They will get arrested and get bashed by the police. [Tsvangirai] How do you go into an election... ...when the opposition is being battered? Mugabe's crackdown on our people leaves a trail of broken limbs, rape victims, torture victims and dead bodies. [reporter] Mr. Mugabe, congratulations on stealing the election. A stolen election would not be a democratic election at all. You talk to President Mbeki. He's going to issue a statement. [applause] [chanting / cheering] The end is coming. It has happened elsewhere in history. I know that the system ultimately cracks down and the dictators go. Mugabe is not going to last for long. I want to befriend my former enemies. [laughs] And get them on my side. Change... change the picture. Be seen as a man of peace. Even if you are not. The game of politics is pretending. [laughs] [people chanting] [music / chanting] [Mwonzora] Change! [crowd sings] ♪ There is no going back now ♪ ♪ There is no going back now ♪ How are you? The first thing we said to Mugabe is that we want this country to have laws. There is a book called a constitution. It is the second most important book after the Bible. So, when we write this constitution, we're making what we call the second revolution. The first revolution we fought with guns, right? We removed the white man. We won that revolution, and we chose a black man as our leader. But we never imagined that a black man could suppress his own people. So what we're doing now is fighting a second war. This second war, ladies, is a war fought with a pen and with our brains. Whites call it a democratic revolution. So, from 10th April, we'll be going around asking every Zimbabwean what they want. Tell us how many years a president should rule. Tell us how much power he should have. And don't forget to tell us how he should be voted out. We want to hear this from you! [laughs] I love that. Saluting. Let's not take the process lightly. Because the constitution is what will define what Zimbabwe does for the next 200-300 years. So if our wishes are left out, then we liberated the country only for others to rule it. What is your role as war veterans? Your first role is to educate the masses. You are the party's political instructors. You should be the people who defend ZANU-PF's position. You must teach the masses. You must teach the masses what our party stands for. That's clever, right? Can you see it? Your second role is to mobilize people to come to the meetings, when the public hearings begins. So, make sure that the day the hearings come, no one is left behind. Boys! So, let's go to work. [radio jingle] [woman] Hello, Zimbabwe, and welcome to "Newsreel." I'm Alex Bell. Today is a historic day. After years of striving to establish a constitutional democracy, Zimbabweans will finally have their say on how they want to be governed. The new constitution, which will be drafted by the parliamentary committee, COPAC, is hoped to limit the president's executive powers and introduce true democracy in Zimbabwe. The constitution-making process will be launched in the capital city Harare today. I have never seen such a disorganized event. Excuse me. I'm sorry. [guard] You have to wait in line. [man] But we are supposed to be in there already. It's OK, officer. I'm Honorable Mwonzora. I'm the chairman of the Select Committee. COPAC. I'm the co-chair. [guard] Honorable Co-Chair Mwonzora... Co-chair, yes. Excuse me. [band plays] Only if our people are free to participate, debate and discuss the aspects they want included in our constitution, will we be able to create a document that reflects the will of Zimbabweans. In this process there can be no reason or excuse for violence. There will be no tolerance of violence against the people. May the God Almighty bless this process to a successful conclusion. I thank you. His Excellency, the president of the Republic of Zimbabwe, Comrade Mugabe. [applause] We are a free people, a sovereign people, and we can decide to have any constitution of our liking, with principles of course. I have my own views, but I want the people to say what they would want. But we are the drivers, and we dare not surrender that to anyone else. [laughter] And this is because we have the authority from the people. We're elected by the people. We represent the people in parliament. We represent the people in our inclusive government, don't we? I can't refuse to rule! Would you have refused, Mr. Tsvangirai? -If you had been elected? -[laughter] We're poised and raise one flag... ...and shall forever belong to Zimbabwe as Zimbabweans. I thank you. [applause] Oh, I forgot to launch the thing. OK, I declare the outreach launched! [applause] Here's the bathroom and the fridge. And the lavatory is there. -You are sure it's not bugged? -Yes. -No one's been here bugging the place? -Yes, sure. This is the TV and the remote, and you've got a tea-making facility. I can assure you of one thing. We are a nation of great pretenders. We are a nation of people who have been cowed by the system. So subtle, but so effective. That... when you just look at people, you won't believe it, and you won't see it. One aspect of our system that has instilled fear in the people of Zimbabwe for a very long time: The secret service. You talk about bugging in this room. These are the radiations of the nature of dictatorship. How they infiltrate people's lives. Everywhere you are, you are afraid. If I say the wrong thing, I might end up behind bars. I may have these dark-glassed guys come and pick me up and bundle me in a vehicle, and take me to a place I don't know. And this has been happening. But on the face of it, things seem normal. But they are not normal. There is terror everywhere. [reporter] The MDC-T is urging all Zimbabweans to participate in the constitutional outreach program. [reporter 2] Seventy teams of ten members each will visit all the provinces. A total of 5,803 meetings are expected to be convened throughout the country. [reporter 1] The co-chairs of the constitutional committee, COPAC, will oversee that the hearings are conducted in a free and democratic manner. But are the people ready to speak out freely in a country where it's usually prohibited to criticize the president and his government? This and more in the bulletin ahead. Whoo! That's what I love. My people have turned up. Good, good, good, good, good! This is one of the venues. Come on, that's very good. Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah! Zimbabwe writing their constitution. I'm finally here! Huh. Hey. How are you? Greetings, everyone! [cheering] Hello, Chief. [Mangwana] Greetings, ladies! [man] The ZANU people are here, but the MDC people are at the school. But they should all be in one place. Not some here and others there. -They all need to be in one place. -But ZANU won't move. They will only meet here? And the MDC people? -They want to stay at the school. -But they all need to be in one place. Listen. Attention, please! Attention, please! Today is not like our usual ZANU meetings. [laughs] I'm told the MDC are at the school, but you asked our people to meet here? Yes, I just thought it was better here. No, no. The newspaper says the meeting is at the school. Let's not make this a big issue. Do you get me? Let's not make this an issue. Can I have your attention, please? Attention, please! Attention, please! There has been two different meeting places announced. -[man] We're not moving! -My comrades. My comrades, my comrades, my comrades, my comrades.. -[man] Why should we move? -My comrades! Listen to me! I'm your senior, and you'll do as I tell you. I'm a senior in ZANU-PF's Central Committee and I will not allow you to sabotage this meeting. Is that clear? Do you hear me? Let's just follow what was decided in Harare. Let's go to the school, because there will be no meeting here. The outreach teams are at the school, and they will be asking only the people from MDC of their views, and they'll be speaking for all of you. Who will lose out? Who will lose out? -Do you want to lose out? -[crowd] No. Do you want to lose out? Then follow me. Then follow me. Will they wait for us at the other place? I will rush over and ask them to wait. They won't start till you get there, OK? -[man] Can you take the grannies? -Yes, the grannies can come in the car. [Mangwana] Come on, grannies, jump in the car. Today is a very significant day for our country and in our lives. We want to write this constitution together with you, the people of Zimbabwe. We want to write what you people want. So, I want to remind you that everything you say will be written in the new constitution. [loudspeaker feedback] Firstly, how should our judges be selected? The president should appoint all the judges. I insist the president is the only one who can choose his judges. I think the president should select the judges. I think the president is the only one capable of appointing judges. The president, as the capable and qualified person we chose, should appoint our judges. The president should appoint the judges. [laughs] One minor issue... -We want to satisfy our leaders, right? -That's right. Yesterday, I was checking in on meetings in Masvingo province. Most people were from ZANU-PF, and the views were all ZANU-PF. Everything was controlled by ZANU-PF. A woman from another province even reported to me: "Most of the meetings were very short." The war vets have organized everything on the ground. The meetings start with a warning in the prayer: "God, we fought hard for this country. "Our leader is Mugabe. "The MDC wants to use the new constitution to remove him. "We won't allow that. [both laugh] "President Mugabe should continue to rule this country." So, the prayer itself basically ended the debate! Nobody said anything. -But we can't control that. -No, that's ZANU-PF at work. Should an executive president rule the country? Or a prime minister? -Only a president. -Only a president. -[man] Let's move over there. -A president only. -Yes, and there? -A president only. [man] We should only have one strong leader in the country. -A president? -Yes. The ZANU-PF people were drilled to give the same answers. Very, very drilled. I should commend them for being very disciplined. It made me very frightened. [Europop ringtone] Hi, Earnest. I'm alright. What I can now confirm is that ZANU-PF as a party went ahead and prepared answers to the talking points. There is fear that people may have been told what to say. Our people are working with all their hearts. Exactly. But otherwise the meetings are well attended. Please, inform our leaders. There is a peaceful atmosphere. Our people are participating. It looks like the education we provided has been effective. So far, so good. We can confirm that during outreach meetings the secret police was present at all meetings. We can definitely tell that. Do you have examples of how these people were intimidated? Whether they were threatened? What they were told? Members of the secret police would be dropped at meeting centers before the arrival of COPAC teams. They would then address the people gathered. On what to say, and what not to say. They would then advise of the specific measures that would be taken against those who... ...did not obey them. Would you say this was well-organized? It was certainly well-organized. You stupid people at the News Day can write all the rubbish you want. The only time you phone me is when you want to comment on something negative. Why are you not talking about positive things? Ask me one good question: How is the constitution-making program going? Ask us as the people driving the process. Ask us, the people driving the process: What progress is going on? Then we'll give you both the negative and the positive. But if you only call me when you have heard something negative, don't waste my time! Yes, thank you, we are now talking. There is very good progress. Outreach has started in Manicaland, and there are no hitches and no incidents. Midlands has started very well. Mashonaland Central, no hitches. The process is going on well. They've started asking people their views, and everything's going very well. Yeah. So, every day, if you ask me about the progress, I'll give it to you. But don't start by picking negative things you have picked up in the street. Then the free press will feel my fist. She will tell her editor: Don't make me call that man again. [loud music] [man] Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey. Hey! -Hey. -OK... -Don't you know Zimbabwe law? -Sure, we know. -Don't you know Zimbabwe law? -[Mwonzora] No, let me explain to you. -[man] I don't want any explanation. -No, it was on the constitution. -Alright, we can go. We can go. -[man] Get the fuck out of here! Get the fuck out of here! [car door closes] [loud thud] Sorry, my friend. We were just... No, my friend. [man] Who are you to come here? [Mwonzora] No, please, my friend... We have... [man] I don't care if you have proper COPAC whatever... Fuck you. [Mwonzora] OK, we will go. Please, sir. I'm really sorry about that. -Driver, hurry, hurry! -[man] Get the fuck out of here! -Get the fuck out of here. -[Mwonzora] Alright, alright. [car engine starts] One day the land shall be free. The Select Committee, COPAC, would like to inform the nation on the developments so far during the constitutional outreach program. Although there were challenges when the process started, there's been some remarkable progress in areas where meetings have been held. -The atmosphere has been conducive... -You say the atmosphere was conducive. At one meeting, only five people were brave enough to make inputs out of the 1,200 people who attended. I do not know what you are talking about. Some people are claiming there has been some violence in some provinces. I must say categorically that these reports are false. When you say there has been no violence, can you categorically say that the reports about outreach monitors being assaulted are absolutely false? So far all the meetings we have conducted are peaceful. If anyone else calling himself whatever visited a beer hall and got assaulted, we can't account for that. Those who dream of Zimbabwe fighting during the constitution-making process continue to perpetuate these lies, but in time, they'll eat humble pie. There's so much fiction in this country. You dream of Mangwana beating you up and you'll fear to come here. But Mangwana is smiling at you. [reporter] The outreach teams are now moving on from the rural areas to the urban centers and to the capital city, Harare. So far, the hearings have been dominated by ZANU-PF. The MDC-T's Douglas Mwonzora, however, says he is convinced MDC-T's supporters will participate in great numbers in the urban areas as these are opposition strongholds not under ZANU-PF control. ZANU has been bussing people in here. That is the sad story. ZANU-PF brought them here to outnumber us. You can already see the tension. And our problem is that our people from the MDC are disorganized. They come here and make noise. They are drunk. They don't finish a statement. They run away and come back. Almost three quarters of the people here are from ZANU-PF. They've bussed all these people in, and now their people are in majority. Next question. What liars people are! They say we've been bussing people in and that there are intimidations and disruptions by ZANU-PF. I personally haven't seen any bussing in. What's that guy from the rural area doing here in a Harare suburb? Who? Which one? He's probably just visiting his sister here in Epworth! [Earnest] That's the guy from the rural area. [Mangwana] Oh. Where do you know him from? We have seen him in the security videos we have. ZANU-PF is consistent. If they want 500 people here, then it's 500 people. We are not seeing our members out there. [sighs] [car horn] They don't have structures. We have solid structures which function. When I give an instruction from up, it filters down. Straight to the street. And that is why most who are attending these sessions are from our party. COPAC is now in Harare, starting today. Can you give us an update? Yes, outreach started very well in Harare, with meetings being well-attended and very peaceful. People were expressing their views as freely as possible. We were quite happy with the way things turned out. Let's do this, boys. Move closer. We want to implement what is known as "down, but not out," OK? Tomorrow the program is going on. Let's organize! -You should have informed us. -Listen to yourself now. -Listen to what sir is saying. -Yes, we are at a disadvantage now. If it were football, it's 1-0 at half-time. What do we do? We have to fight. Yes? There's a place called Mai Musodzi Hall in Mbare. I understand there's been skirmishes. Some people got hurt, others arrested. I don't know if there has been a gun shot... Have you been there? What do we do? Really? How many are hurt? Really? Yes, in two minutes I'll be there. This is quite some crowd. [man] Your Honor, how are you? [Mangwana] All good, and you? What are those beer bottles doing at a meeting? Why stop now? -We have decided to do it tomorrow. -No, I'm not here tomorrow. -And many others, too. Why not today? -[Mangwana] No, man. Why not? [man] Boss, we're not here tomorrow. We were brought here in busses. We are ready today. Tomorrow is Monday, people are working. Let's just do this COPAC thing today! We are ready now! [Mangwana] No, you've got to cool down. If you speak like that, I'm not able to answer you. [Mangwana] Alright, order, order, order! Order, order! Please, come this way. Come this way. Please, let's talk about this. Sit on the benches there. I said sit down, so we can talk about this! -Everyone calm down! -[man] Let's gather here. Ask everyone to come this way, so we do this together. [smashing] [fence rattling] [Mangwana] Let's get out of here. -[knocking] -Yeah? I am coming back here! -[man] Don't waste people's time. -I said I'm coming back. -[man] You're a sellout! -[thud] -We bumped into something? -Someone threw a stone under the car. Remove the stone! -[woman] This is a sign of failure! -I'm coming back! We don't like sellouts! You know what we do to them! Just move! Just go! [man] We'll beat sellouts! We'll beat those who sell the country! Yesterday, we had meetings scheduled for Harare. Unfortunately, we received allegations that "some" political parties had bussed people to venues. People were not free to express themselves. As a result, most of the meetings were aborted because of the violence and intimidation that was pervading the meetings. At Mai Musodzi Hall in Mbare, there was a lot of violence. Five people were taken to hospital after receiving injuries. At some meetings, Honorable Mangwana and myself were also harassed. [reporter] The constitution-making process has been suspended with immediate effect after violence disrupted the public meetings in Harare. Several MDC supporters were injured. Prime minister and leader of the MDC-T, Morgan Tsvangirai, said his party will not tolerate any violence in the constitution-making process. Tsvangirai has threatened to pull out, unless the public hearings can be conducted in a free and democratic manner. The MDC and ZANU-PF, however, disagree on the way forward, and a deadlock has been declared. [Mwonzora] Your party spoilt it all with violence and bussing. -It wasn't necessary. -[Mangwana] No, it was not necessary. I even told my party it's not necessary to bus in any people. Don't! [Mwonzora] So, our ability to correct the situation will be put into play. [Mangwana] Yeah, of course. -This side. -This side. So, we sit in here. I will sit here. Bishop? Listen. The dogs are unleashed. They need to be brought back home. Yeah. Ceasefire. Whoa! Can you assist us with damage control? Damage control. That thing is now getting out of hand. It's as if ZANU-PF doesn't want the constitution anymore. The message in the country is that ZANU-PF doesn't want the constitution. That has never been our intention. So we need to control it immediately and swiftly. [novelty ringtone] Hello. Hey, my friend. I'm fine. How are you? What's up? That young boy we saw? He is dead? Oh, Jesus... Oh... Thanks for telling me. One of the people who was assaulted in Mbare has died. At Mai Musodzi Hall. -Let's make this short. -That's fine. [music / singing] [Mwonzora] My condolences. I'm very sorry. Did he tell you who beat him when he came home? He just said that he had been beaten up, and that it was by a lot of people. -Alright. OK. Where did he die? -He died in hospital. OK, I understand. Ma'am, I'm very sorry. Is there anything else you want to tell me? Just that it's very painful for us that a person can actually be beaten to death just like that. -We are really hurting. -I understand. Yes, we're really in pain. [man] Beaten to death while we write our constitution! Just like that. We don't have faith that you're hearing what we're saying. That we can ever speak freely at the public hearings. Because the same people will come back and beat us up. -Mugabe is a bullshit! Mugabe must go! -Alright, I'll see what I can do. [laughter] [singing] ♪ Tell the ruler to let his children go ♪ ♪ Tell the ruler to let his children go ♪ ♪ Mwonzora, set us free! ♪ ♪ Mwonzora is with us ♪ ♪ Mwonzora! ♪ ♪ Mwonzora is with us ♪ [soundtrack only] Come here, my friend. [Mangwana] The angels are not on our side. [Mwonzora] What do you mean? My friend, having come this far and we are just getting messed up now. Or we are messing ourselves up. Yes. The main issue here is violence. Because the violence goes to the fundamentals of the relationship between the parties. It's that the incidents push people's minds back. Personally, I think... Well, it may be a solution you may need to think about. All the areas that are affected have to be redone. Symbolically. Where the police come and meaningfully restore order. But I drove around that day. Especially on this side of Harare, the meetings were all peaceful. The meeting at Mufakose was like a church service. What I'm saying is: Let's say at 10:30 things are fine. You are satisfied and happy. Everyone looks happy. Then you leave. At 11:30 a group comes, and the meeting becomes riotous. In your mind it was all peaceful. So, those are some of the realities, because the report signed by both parties says that meeting was riotous. Oh? Mangwana and ZANU-PF do not want Harare to be redone. The reason is that if Harare is redone, it will be redone under conditions which are different from those that were created by ZANU-PF. The conditions they created, conditions of intimidation, harassment of people, bussing in of people from the rural areas. It was an expensive exercise for them. Now, if it is to be redone, then those people will be absent, and the Harareans will speak. And they will speak with a vengeance. Mangwana and company are afraid of that. -Hello, sir. How are you? -Fine, fine. -Your report is ready? -Yes. Just go through the report on your own. -Then we can compare notes. -OK. -Fundo Primary School, volatile. -[Mangwana] What does "volatile" mean? -Volatile? It's very tense. -No. That's a very big English word. -Go and check the dictionary. -Meaning? Volatile means at one stage or the other there could have been argument. -It was an explosive situation. -Give it up! I attended some of these meetings. So, for me to agree they were bad, someone has to define what they mean by volatile. Certainly not conducive. They may mean something else, but not conducive. -I'm simply saying... I want to look... -Volatile is not the same as conducive. No, it's not. But does that condemn a meeting, which otherwise was OK? Something motivated them to use it. -One participant insulted team leaders. -So...? There is no meeting without a situation. One participant attacked a team leader. Does that make the meeting disordered? If we have to redo all the ones that were tense, then we'll have to re-do every single meeting in the entire country. -We're dealing with Harare... -We can't take Harare out of context. We were asked to do a report for Harare. We can't take Harare out of context. Harare is happening in a Zimbabwean context. The official report states that at first there was some tenseness, but the meeting proceeded smoothly. That's all we need to know. Except that it doesn't say the meeting proceeded well. So, we redo that one. -Kuwadzana High School. -District 19. -It says riotous? -Yes, it was riotous. -Are you sure? -Yes, that was riotous. -[Mwonzora] C.J. Hall. Tense and noisy. -No, it's fine. You insist on a meeting being as peaceful as a church service. [Mwonzora] Very volatile. Waterfalls. [Mwonzora] Redo, redo... Alright, call me tomorrow. Let me get back to you. Great. Well done! Mangwana is playing bravado. -Ah, but he has... -He has lost it. [laughs] It's going to be a very good news item. Harare to be redone. Dead set! [woman] How much power should the president have? How much power should the president have? Excuse me! What I want to know is ... ...why anyone would take the powers from the current president? He's not going anywhere. He really is not going anywhere! He will rule until he dies. He will rule until he dies. [uproar] I would like a president to be elected by people's vote and there should be laws for him to step down when his term is over. We also want a president from our party. [cheering] [yelling] Folks, please... The girl is bringing up crucial points. You're destroying her speech. Be quiet and let her speak. A president should be between the age of 40 and not older than 75. [uproarious response] If the president is found guilty, parliament must have the power to demand that he steps down. Everyone should have the right to air their views with no discrimination. Just allow us to be free in all those areas where we are suppressed. A president should have a maximum of two terms of five years. No president should be so old that he dies in power! [applause] - ♪ Zimbabwe, times are changing ♪ -Change! ♪ Zimbabwe, times are changing ♪ ♪ Tsvangirai, ring your bell and let's go! ♪ ♪ Tsvangirai, ring your bell and let's go! ♪ -[man] OK, can we move on? -4.11.3a. To be rephrased to: "Exercise control over or interfere with anyone licensed..." We have added the word "licensed." "...and engaged in broadcasting." You must be licensed and then engaged in broadcasting. [man] I'm having a problem with that. [Mangwana] I also have a problem, Chairman, with the rate and pace at which we are going. Chair, you are very wrong, with due respect. Wait, let me speak. I want to answer for myself. I have a right, like any other Select Committee person, to query, if I so wish, what the co-chairpersons are presenting. Let's write a constitution that we'll all be able to defend. If I have a genuine concern, it's a genuine concern. What I'm not going to accept, Honorable Mangwana, is for you to dictate to me. You can't! I'm a representative of my own organization. We are equal in here, I want to make that clear. Surely I'm entitled to raise things if I feel that something is wrong? We have found each other, and we have overcome some of the sticky issues. One of which was: That political parties represented in COPAC are equal. Their co-chairpersons are equal, and there is no one who is above the other. Every decision is done by consensus. Once we agreed on that, we are moving. [cheering / applause] Well done, Mwonzora! [reporter] Zimbabwean police have arrested MDC lawmaker Douglas Mwonzora as he was leaving Parliament yesterday. A spokesman for the party says that the charges leveled against him are politically motivated and completely false. Mwonzora is currently being held in detention awaiting bail. -What is your party doing to Mwonzora? -What? Making up these fake cases. It's not fair. -You guys are trying to distract him. -No, not at all. Not at all. It's a deliberate move that they raise his case at this point when they're supposed to discuss the crucial part of the drafting process. And... they tend to take away his focus. And as you probably have noticed, Mangwana is in full gear. He feels he's in charge. Good. 2.8, agreed. 2.9, agreed. Thank you very much for being so cooperative, ladies and gentlemen. Let us continue tomorrow in this spirit, and we'll have a constitution within the next ten days. -[man] You've done very well, Mangwana. -Sure! Thank you very much. I'm going down to a very awkward situation because it's part of the constitution. I'm sure you're used to it. In the last month, 100 people, MDC and others, have been detained because here you arrest people, then you do investigations. This is extremely dangerous for this inclusive government and for your constitutional process, which must come to a logical conclusion. Our having an inclusive government is no license for people to commit crimes, and then when they are arrested, they say: "We've been victimized." They arrest people in this country, and then they do investigations. -You arrest somebody on the suspicion. -You don't have to put them in jail. It's a bailout system. In South Africa, it's there. You do not stay overnight in South Africa in a filthy prison with no running water. These are disgusting, lice-ridden hellhole prisons. -Remove your sanctions, and we'll... -Bullshit about the sanctions. -It's bullshit to blame the sanctions. -We can argue for the whole day. Our law allows the judiciary system... Your incompetent police force can't do their investigations and so they arrest people. I've been in prison. I know it firsthand. You can only fight the system if you have the same weapons that they are using against you. The system is armed. The system has prisons. And what do you have? Your bare hands. Your legal knowledge... All those become useless weapons. I'm in the system, and I know how lethal it is. You can't fight it. You're kidding yourself. [Mangwana] The constitution-making process is a people-driven, inclusive process. The stakeholders will be given an opportunity to discuss the draft and adopt it before it is presented to Parliament for debate. When the draft is in place, it will be presented to a stakeholder conference for further discussion and scrutiny. As we promised, we are... The co-chairs are happy to entertain questions from yourselves. Save that I want to protect my brother from being questioned about his experience at "college." [laughter] [Mangwana] We will not answer those questions. Any further questions? -This is the real press conference. -Yes, this is the real one. My arrest was not a fair arrest at all. The arrest was not justified. The manner of arrest was not justified. Three days in the police station I was not allowed water or food. That showed that the people who arrested me were not really interested in the alleged crime, but in creating certain conditions. It was obviously meant to affect the ability of the MDC in this process. I am in opposition, because I want to remove Mr. Mugabe. Mr. Mugabe and the ZANU-PF know that. And we don't have to say nice things if we are to remove him from power. We have lost about a month, but having said that, I am against the rushing of this process because it would produce a wrong result. It is important that we respect the views of the people of Zimbabwe and give them due seriousness and consideration in the drafting of the final report. I don't think that Mangwana is a representative of the decisions that his party makes. So, to that extent I have nothing against him. He did not cause my arrest. Every time you see Mangwana pushing things, he is being pushed by his party. And he loses all reasoning. So, he is a... messenger, who must not be shot with the message. [man speaking indistinctly in background] I've been called for trial on the 2nd. -They won't agree to a postponement. -You're charged with a technicality. I want to take it to the supreme court. And also... you see... They're prosecuting one person. They're prosecuting me, because I'm me. [reporter] Robert Mugabe is understood to be unhappy in the coalition government and wants the new constitution done as soon as possible. Paul Mangwana is under high pressure to complete the constitution, or else the process will be taken over by a management committee appointed by the president. -He was in court again. -But they could have advised us. -Instead of keeping us waiting. -I know. We've lost half the day. I think we need an introspection. Are we serious about coming up with a constitution within any given time? Last week we only worked for two days. And what is this saying to the country, which is expecting a constitution? I think let's be fair with each other. The delays are not my fault. I don't want to delegate, and my party doesn't accept that I delegate. So, those who arrest me right now and bring me before courts are slowing the process themselves, and they know it. This is our predicament as the MDC-T team. There's me being prosecuted for offenses that were allegedly committed in 2003. And the timing is now, when we're at this crucial stage. But this is the reality on the ground. This is the state we are living in. If I was to tell you what happens in the courts when we get there... You're just made to sit there. No prosecutor takes your case. No magistrate takes your case. And then you are told to go home. After five to six hours... We are not making this up. We are being harassed. It's not justice at all. I'm representing a party which has been in power for 33 years using the same constitution. Obviously, anything which keeps you in power is not bad. So, by leading the process of changing what has really been working... Convincing your leadership that though it's been working, it's not the best thing for the country. It needs to change. That's not an easy task. -Hi! -Madame. Now that you came, I'm sure everything will be alright. -And how are you this morning? -I'm alright. OK. Nice to see you. I am alive now. We need to be more aggressive in the inclusive government. I think we are treating ZANU-PF with kid gloves too much. So, we need to show some teeth. Who told them this? "A person is disqualified for election as president if he or she has already held office for one or more periods." My president reading this? He is being disqualified in a draft? Why did they put this in? Can't you see the political... -We'll ask that question today. -With politics working like this? I'm just fed up. I'm going to take a political position. -No. My young brother, listen to me. -They've taken a political position. Somebody still wants his job, and he writes that. So sensitive, so provocative. If you have sensitivities, why do you write that? You are saying that I'm stupid. It's disqualifying the incumbent! No, my comment is that the draft is fine. The clause is a good clause. It has to be there. So, those who have been presidents before must not be allowed to contest anymore. You put in a clause which is actually removing the candidacy of the most powerful person in the political scene, that's the existing president, on the belief that it will not be seen. So, you're actually undermining and disrespecting the team setup. That they'll be so naive as to not see what you have done. [reporter] A highly confidential draft of Zimbabwe's new constitution has been leaked to the press and was printed in today's "Herald." The leaked document contains a controversial clause, which bars Robert Mugabe from reelection. The clause says that any person who's already held the presidential office for ten years is disqualified from contesting in the next polls. It has caused chaos at ZANU-PF's politburo. A spokesperson said the clause is an insult to the president and the ZANU-PF party. Party colleagues and war veterans have labeled Mangwana a sellout for allowing the clause in the new constitution, which would end Mugabe's presidency. Right now, I don't think Mangwana is a very safe person in ZANU-PF. Because some of the ZANU-PF people think he sold out, think that he is against the president. To be called a sellout in Zimbabwe is to be condemned to death. The militia can do anything they want with you. The army, the intelligence and the police... Your treatment, or ill treatment by these organs becomes justified because of your label. He could be killed. Obviously they are insinuating that I'm part of a team which is trying to oust the president from power. If you read the headline and the story... The headline reads: "Mugabe ouster plot thickens. Mangwana set for grilling." So, in other words, I'm part of a team trying to oust him through the use of the constitutional draft. It came from the drafters. The clause which says that Mugabe... "A person is disqualified for election if he has already held office for one or more periods, continuous or not, amounting to ten years." ...did not come from outreach. Did not come from the Select Committee. It was an invention of the drafters. Mangwana is suing Daily News for one million. This is the problem of dealing with the press from a position of authority, and then you lose that authority. The man was Minister of Information. Could summon any editor. Now he is on the receiving end of actual journalism and doesn't know how to react. Because they are insinuating that I'm not loyal to my own leadership, which is quite a serious indictment on my political character. No, it was put in there by drafters, as a proposal by the drafters, which we obviously are going to review and most likely remove. I think a clause like this... Let's debate it very detachedly. It is necessary. "A person is disqualified for election if he or she has already held office as president for one or more periods amounting to ten years." -I do have a problem straight away. -Yes, Mr. Mangwana. I think we need to first of all satisfy ourselves that what we are reading came from our instructions. If it didn't, it should be deleted. It can only be part of our draft after we've all agreed it should be there. Because in the first place, it was not supposed to be there. -OK, and therefore it must what? -It must be removed. We are not in agreement. [Mangwana] Then if we are failing... If we are failing to agree on simple terms, we are not prepared to proceed. We have a fundamental problem, and we don't even agree on how to deal with it. I didn't know that this was going to arise. If anything they put here did not come from us, we must remove it. We did not give them that chapter. They gave us this chapter. The content of this chapter... It may have been given the wording that it is not supposed to have, but in fact that content has been discussed and, to my knowledge, agreed. [Mangwana] No, you are wrong. If we disagree here because you interpret it wrongly, then we don't agree. Let's not waste time. -[Mwonzora] Why are you so angry? -Because you insult my intelligence. You insult my intelligence by deliberately misinterpreting... [Mwonzora] Aren't you insulting his intelligence? I'm arguing with a Ph.D. [Mwonzora] The debate is out of order. Now with that disagreement, I think it is futile for us to proceed. I don't seem to appreciate whether we are making much movement here. [reporter] ZANU-PF lawmaker Paul Mangwana has been accused of staging a political coup against Robert Mugabe. Mangwana denies the allegations and says the clause was illegally inserted by the drafters of the new charter. He is now threatening to fire the drafters for misconduct. Political analysts say that firing the drafters could be the final straw that would collapse the entire constitution-making process, which is now more than two years behind schedule and has been marred by controversy from the beginning. First, it was only NewsDay, and we thought it was only a small matter. It went onto the Daily News. It has become personal, attacking me. Alleging that I'm planning to do a technical coup. If my leader hears that the one he sent to do the job now wants to remove him do you think he'll be happy? [continues talking indistinctly on the phone] This guy is under pressure. Freedom is coming tomorrow... [laughter] Let me just say, Mr. Mangwana, that the spirit that we want to work in is that the people here must be free, must feel free to contribute. I may share the same sentiments with you, or I may not. So, OK, fine, there is debate there. There is disagreement on whether this content is within the instruction or not. I think to be fair to the drafters... To be fair to the drafters... Their interpretation of the mandate was not outrageous. If we want to continue on this route, I'll say let's stop here. I seek further political instructions on the way forward. On whether or not, with this level of disobedience, we can continue to have the same drafters. We are mixing two things... I'd have to seek instructions, because I have a whole analysis I've done. And I'll go back to my party and say: "This is what I instructed the drafters to do. This is what they have done." If the analysis shows a percentage of not following instructions, can they follow instructions? Can I repose trust and confidence in them? Whether we are going to stop or whatever is up to you. But the issue is: I am not going to stop giving my opinion, because it will offend you. I am a Zimbabwean, entitled to give my opinion. I am a lawyer by profession, I'm a lawyer by training. You need to appreciate that. But we are saying, it is justified! -We don't want to argue whether it's... -It is justified! It is not a misconduct. -We are not charging anyone... -Yes, you want to fire drafters. We're here to audit and not to justify why the drafters did what they did. -[Mwonzora] And not to fire them. -No! I've said I'm not firing them. But if you continue to justify them, you are now pushing me to also take the argument of firing. If you don't push for a justification, I won't fire. If you justify, I'll fire. If you push for a justification, I'm going to fire them. [Mwonzora] There is something which answers to substance, Mr. Mangwana. I think it is important because... Who will fire who? We will be firing ourselves as well. Forget about it. It's not going to happen. [soundtrack only] Honorable Members. I think it is best to lay the cards on the table so that we appreciate each other when people take certain stances. Honorable Mangwana, I'm uncomfortable with the talk about firing the drafters, because then we will wave this whole thing bye-bye. I will admit there are some areas where they went overboard. They are there. But we want the constitution to succeed. We can not defend something which collapses the process. Doesn't make sense to us. So, let's go to... Nobody loses anything. And this presidential clause, I don't have any problems rewriting that. There's no problem. I just took new instructions on this clause. That clause has to be interrogated. We can substitute it, even remove it. -I'm in agreement. -No problem. Audit, substance. And in auditing, you'll be saying this is it in this document? Yes. [laughter] My older brother, you are looking relieved. -You are saved. You didn't oust him. -No? The ouster clause... Election of President. Election of President... [reporter] Robert Mugabe has survived the alleged plot to oust him as the controversial clause, that would have barred him from serving more terms as president, has been revised. The presidential term limits will now only apply to future presidents, who will be able to serve a maximum of two five-year terms. [woman] Mr. Mangwana, are you alright? I want to give you a hug, but I don't know if I can? You're calling our office shouting your lungs out. Are you from The Standard? How can you publish a... Let's discuss it in the shade. How do you publish a defamatory statement about someone as important as I am? Running such an important project? You call me a liar? Someone, who is misrepresenting things to the president? I'm lying to the politburo? I should be replaced, I'm incompetent? -Yes, that was a mistake. -Any sane journalist would know... -It wasn't a journalist who wrote that. -No! I've been minister of information. When we want to convey certain things we pretend someone has written a letter to the editor. I am going to take your paper to the cleaners! The first law you must learn as a journalist is how to avoid a defamatory suit. -But that was a letter to the editor... -If it's defamatory, don't publish it. If you publish a defamatory letter, you have participated in defaming. In a bigger way than even the person who has written it. Because the person has written to you, and you've let the whole country know! And now to discuss the constitution-making process and the media reportage on the issue, we're joined by COPAC co-chairperson, Comrade M. Paul Mangwana. -We welcome you to News Hour. -Good evening. And claims that you should be disbanded? COPAC should be disbanded? That is retrogressive. We have done a lot of work to come to where we are. We are almost finishing the task. If the media can leave us alone, we could come up with a draft constitution by the end of this month. But we need peace and more positive reportage for us to concentrate on our work. We are going to surprise Zimbabweans by coming up with a constitution they'll love. I must be able to say: Whilst my party believes in this, but what is good for the country is that. I've got the role to persuade my party. It's not everything which is there, which my party wants. You must be an instrument of change. Changing the mindset of your leadership. Then that is leadership. Give me an alternative, where you will say: This will take the process forward. Natural resources should benefit inhabitants where they live. I agree. Recognition that the power to rule... That is clause 8. ...the power to rule must be derived from the authority of the people. Let's debate this. The ZANU-PF position, as I understand it, is here. -Let's send separate papers! -Why should you tell us that? We can conduct our disagreements in a more civilized way, I think? What I've realized is that people don't admire ruffians... for leaders. They don't admire bullying people. FINAL NEGOTIATIONS [Mangwana] The Constitution of Zimbabwe. Not the COPAC Draft Constitution. It's now The Constitution of Zimbabwe. Write Zimbabwe just below there. We can say "by COPAC," if you want. -[woman] This one? -That's it. Super. I will keep this one in my safe at home. The original. Yes, each of us should have a copy for life. [indistinct chatter / laughter] -Have they started signing? -They have started signing. -But we are not signing today. -No, I know. You will sign tomorrow. The Draft Constitution of Zimbabwe. The Constitution of Zimbabwe. Congratulations. [cheering / laughter] Once we've finished signing, there's one place I want to show you. -What have you hidden in here? -I won't say now. I'll show you after you've signed. I won't reveal it now. [laughter] -I also want a copy for me. -No, these will all be signed now. You'll have to wait for your own one. Whether we did it well, or we didn't do it well, we have a constitution, guys. Because of the unique nature of our arrangement... Motion number one. Honorable Mwonzora. Mr. Speaker, I can say with authority that, under this constitution, we have the most comprehensive Bill of Rights on the African continent. If not in the whole world. We have rights to personal liberty. Rights of arrested and detained persons, Mr. Speaker. [laughter] I must say that this constitution-making process is to go down in history as one of the processes which brought about national healing in our country. We started with quarrels, by the time we completed this process, you could not distinguish an MDC-member from a ZANU-PF member, a ZANU-PF member from an MDC-T member. That is the kind of national healing this process achieved. [singing / cheering] I have the result of the poll for the referendum, and it is as follows: 3,079,966 votes were received in favor of the adoption of the draft constitution. 179,489 votes were received against the adoption. The draft constitution is declared to have been adopted by the people of Zimbabwe as the Constitution of Zimbabwe. I thank you. [applause] -Congratulations. -We made it. There we are. [soundtrack only] Mugabe is going to read these signatures. And he shall read this signature. I'm so proud of my work. I can't believe that I, the son of Mangwana, has given this country a new life with this beautiful constitution I have written. The good thing is, this constitution is no longer changeable by the principals, including Mugabe. [band plays] [chanting] Please be seated. I want to thank... ...COPAC, the Select Committee... ...for now having come to brought us to this stage. We waited and waited and waited... And we thought there was to be no end. Sometimes parliament thinks that it is so, so sovereign that it should control the acts of the principals. It's not! [laughter] Mwonzora! -And your new friend Mangwana... -[laughter] ...you have been showing off here! [laughter] Sometimes people fail to know where power has derived from. There is no end to... the clear, clear violation of principles of natural justice on the part of ZANU-PF. It's an evil party, an evil system, presided over by an evil man. [Mangwana] If you don't change, you will be changed. If you do not change yourself, your tactics, your strategies, your way of doing things, then change will change you. So, you must move with change. Life is dynamic. This is what I was telling my party colleagues. It's dynamic. Politics is about doing what is popular, and what is popular changes. So, you and the project had to be destroyed? Me and the project had to be destroyed. -So, they wanted to it be an accident? -Yes. They wanted an accident. They sent word to my team that I had sold out and the team then said: Let's destroy him and the project. When I visited the general and put my cards on the table, he told me of all the people who were involved in it. It was a powerful team. Those who are in the know in my party, they are saying: We do not know how you survived. What I will advise is, don't demobilize. We shouldn't demobilize. -We shouldn't demobilize. -The war is still going on. Now that you are no longer having as much attention... -Yes, that's when they will strike. -And an accident then looks real. So, you need to just be careful. [indistinct]
