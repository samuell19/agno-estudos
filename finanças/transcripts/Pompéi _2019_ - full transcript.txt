Your turn. Soon you'll be a man. I'll take Diesel, please. Hey, Victor. Another jerk. Can't you read? We're out. Give me back my money. Dream on. What's up? Leaving already? And your money? - Doesn't matter. Yes, it matters. Think we do this for fun? That we don't need it? You need every cent you have? What for, to eat it? Stop it, let me leave. No, we'll fill it up. Give me my money. Wanna play? You'd shoot me for $50? I'll die when I want to die. Won't be today... with your shitty gun. Now scram. Fuck off! Billie? You there, my love? Yes, Mom. Did those men hurt you? No. I worry myself sick. I wish you were better... back to your old self. Not locked up anymore. Billie? Are you listening? Billie, talk to me. It's always smoke, smoke, smoke. They never stop. They eat, they smoke. They fuck, they smoke. Not just one, either. Three or four at once. Screw the Chinks. We want chicks. That's my point. The Chinks have chicks. Girls like it when you smoke. Look. You take a drag. You pretend to be thinking about something intellectual. But you're eyeing her butt. She thinks you're thinking about her. Girls love that. Fanfi, you didn't pay! - I did! Beat it, now! They're starting! Lemme see. We'll get your Dad's crate running. When we have cash, we'll polish her up. The wipers work, at least. Shit, it's about time! Victor? Want smokes or cash? - Smokes! It's that girl. Why's she here? Did you come for your dough? She's here for me. You came to see me? Yeah. You work here all day? No, I don't work. Me neither. Is the bike yours? - Yeah. Take me for a ride? If you want. Where do you live? Down by the Stilts. Lived there long? Yeah, but I was at boarding school. Not anymore? No. I got suspended for the year. You always dress like that? Yeah. Bye. I want to see you. Tomorrow? Every single day. Come to the Cheyenne tomorrow. One day at a time. Toxou! He brought the car back to life! You did it? I told you I would. Got money for gas? How'd you pay for it? An opportunity came up. You'll pay me back later. Go ahead, she's yours. Hey! Shut up! I see big fir trees and canyons. Me, I see a normal highway. I see your mom hustling and the lineup to fuck her. The dig site. A good one. Don't screw up. Are we on? Yeah. - Yeah? When can we go? He'll let us know. The site's being surveyed. Will we have time? He thinks so. And you? With Billie? Still surveying? Or have you started to dig? See? She came to you. You didn't even have to search. She's not a freighter, she's just a lifeboat. Did you draw any? Yeah. When I was a kid. Do you bring many girls here? Often? No. Not that many. How many? I don't know. Will you love me? You really think we'll find something? This is our lucky break, I feel it. Just get it done quick! Is it true you tried to gas your parents? The kids say that. On TV they said that a meteorite was going to destroy the planet. It was on every channel. They even gave the date. So, I wanted to die before it happened. It wasn't about killing them. I wanted to save them. Is the date past, or will you kill me too? It was supposed to hit ages ago. Is that why your dad packs a gun? In case you go off again? They lock me away so I won't. I have to learn to contain myself. What do they want you to contain, your blood? The shrinks say that. I have to control my mind, master it. Otherwise I'll be swept away, vulnerable. Your school sounds great. We all want to kill at some point. Even if no one will admit it. You never wanted to? Yeah. My dad, once or twice. I didn't have the chance. - He died? He took off. Long ago. Maybe he had a good reason. - No. He's a coward, he ran. He's a liar. He robbed graves. He fucked up and took off. Do you rob graves too? No. Come. Jimmy, get up! Shower! Victor! Look, they match. Look. They're worthless. What's that for? The kids chipped in. Are the kids in charge now? No. You are. What do you care? I don't. Don't we get to see your garters? Don't worry. Think you can come here and do as you please? Yeah. Well, you're wrong. Think you're special? We have rules here. No exceptions. Beat it. Screw your rules. We're done for today. Aren't we staying late? - Not today. Why not? I'm sure I'd have found something. We'll get our asses hauled. I want to see you again. I was afraid you wouldn't come back. You pest! Where were you? Gimme a smoke. The lighter. Toxou was looking for you. What's wrong? Nothing. How about you? I'm fine. What're you doing? I hear you're never at the site. You dig when you want. You're just like your dad. No sense of accountability. Think you can walk away? Your site is crap. Nothing there. Don't you realize you owe me money? I don't give a shit. What's got into you? We can't. They'll kill us. Of course we can. We won't tell them. They'll never know. I don't want to be a traitor. There are no traitors. I found a piece of a man. It's like he was waiting for us. This is our way out, Jimmy. Is it true your brother's still seeing Billie? Yeah, it's true. Rasky saw them heading for the canyon. Why didn't you tell us? Why can't we watch her anymore? How do I know? Your brother's a dick. I hate waiting and you don't come. Go to sleep. What a piece of junk. Don't worry, I'll fix it. Was she here when your dad left? Who was there? You. You were there. Right. The oil's fine. Check the filter. Get in. Will you come if I leave? You said only cowards run away. I was wrong. Tomorrow. Noon. A the pillar. Come with me. I need more. Can't do it. I need more. Take it or I'll rat you out. I don't wanna do it. I want to wait for my brother. Calm down, madam. Your request was passed on. We'll send a unit as soon as possible. Your daughter will be safe. Let me go. What is it? Tell me, Jimmy. Or you'll be alone like never before. Jimmy! Jimmy! Jimmy! Victor. Victor. The sun will rise soon.
