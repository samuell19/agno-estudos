Okay, Mom. Honey, Otto's not a little boy anymore. Otto, if there's a real emergency, you know, and something really bad happens call 911, okay? What do you mean, "really bad?" I don't know, a fire or lightening, an earthquake, a bad hair day, that kinda stuff. - What? - Yeah. Oh, Mom, come on. I'm spending my summer vacation here at the zoo with Benjamin. Nothing bad'll happen. Ah, you're right. Have fun at the beach! Morning, Mrs. Meier! - Hello, Otto. Good morning! Hey, you two, morning! Hey, Leo! Patty, Polly, hey there! Morning, Gunther! Hi, Schnippy! One, two, can you hear me? Sorry about the feedback. Okay, hello there, I'm Karla Kolumna and I welcome you all on this beautiful day to the Neustadt Zoo. And now, here's our zoo director, Mr. Tierlieb. Woo! A warm welcome to all of you. Thank you for joining us for our charity extravaganza. In a moment, you'll hear our own band, Karl and the Zoomaniacs! Now, you may ask, "How can I support this great zoo?" By buying raffle tickets, hmm? - Morning! - Good morning! - Hello! - Hi, Karl! - Hey, Otto. - So where's Benjamin? I don't know, he should be here by now. I'll check his house, maybe he's there. Super. Benjamin, Benjamin? Ha, oh boy. Benjamin, wake up! Ha! Good morning, Otto! Morning. I felt like I was smelling sugar just now. What sugar? No, you must have been dreaming. Okay, I'll sleep a little longer then. No, you need to get up right away! Everyone's expecting you, they're waiting. What, it's only 6 a.m. It's too early for them to be expecting me! No, it's a quarter past nine! Really, oh guess you're right. It's a little past nine. Only a quarter past nine. Oh, it's already past nine! That's not good! So I'm really late. Oh no, everyone must be waiting for me. What should I wear? Oh dear, past nine. Oh my, I'm supposed to help with the charity event! - Benjamin? - What is it? You're going to wear your PJ's? My pajamas? Whoopsie! I gotta hurry! Good luck to you! They should be here by now. We can't wait much longer! Right, I know what you mean. Karl, start playing, go ahead! Let's go. We are the Zoomaniacs, so let's start off with a classic. ♪ In a beautiful green meadow ♪ There's a big gray mountain ♪ Stretches his legs up to the sky ♪ ♪ Next to him there is a dwarf ♪ No, the dwarf is Otto ♪ And the mountain an elephant ♪ He is friendly and can speak ♪ Everybody knows him ♪ And he likes to lie in the sun ♪ ♪ And all around him all the bees buzz ♪ Benjamin, Benjamin? Yes? Now they're calling my name! One, two, one, two, three, four! Benjamin! Whoa, ah! Sorry, coming through! Watch out, runaway skateboard! Benjamin? Sorry, I kind of got off on the wrong foot. Yeah. Everyone please excuse this. Well, I really don't know what just happened there. That was... - That was quite a moment! Unexpected things happen here at our zoo. Sorry about that, really. So please, buy some raffle tickets and help us keep the Neustadt Zoo going. - Oh, my ice cream. - Sorry! Wait, here. - Huh? All for me? - Mm hmm. - Benjamin! - Otto! What happened? When I got here, I scared this little girl and she dropped her ice cream cone but I was able to calm her down. What little girl? The one that I gave the balloons. Yoo hoo, Mama! Look at me, I can fly! Mia, you come back here right now! There she goes, what can we do? The playground! Mia! We're coming! Ai, yi, yi, oh boy, where? There she is in those trees! Please don't let go! Could I please borrow that? Thank you! What are you doing, Otto? Benjamin, I need you to help me! Oh, you think that'll work? Yes, we have to hurry or I'll miss her! Okay! - Ah. - A ha! Yeah! Otto, be careful and hold on tight! Oh boy, oh boy! Great idea, Otto! That's it, keep it up! It worked! You did it, how great! Yeah, but how am I gonna get. Whoa! Phew. That really was, Incredibly cool! Thank you. Glad to help. That was fun, Mama, can I do it again? This is going to be the best summer ever! We're going to share good times and have fun! Sure, for instance, eating ice cream. - And camping. - Chocolate ice cream. - And canoeing! - And vanilla! We can build a camp fire. And of course strawberry too. I love it. Yeah! Benjamin, you really are my best friend. - Well you're not. - Huh? You are my very best friend! Hey, look. Oh there's not even enough here to pay for all the broken benches. He looks worried. If this keeps up, then... Then what? Huh, it's nothing, no worries. Uh oh, when Mr. Tierlieb says it's nothing, that's not a good thing, no. Think the zoo will have to shut down soon? What? No, we can't let that happen. We must do something to help him. You're right. - There, done. - Perfect. - Whoa! - I guess, we need extra tough nails for when I sit. What do I see? A Loxodonta africanus and a Homo sapien. A loxdo what? A Loxondonta africanus. Yes, I mean an elephant and a person. But you two are friends. - Ooh. That's rather strange. Really? I don't see what's so strange about that. It would be much stranger if we weren't. I mean, we've always been really good friends. How silly of me. My name is White, Walter White. I'm Benjamin and this is Otto. What are you doing here? Oh, observing. Ob whatting? For example, the Gracula religiosa or the Psittaciformes macaw. Ca cow? - No, Macaw! - Huh? - He must mean parrot! - Exactly! Here, listen to this. Ah, mm hmm. Gotcha, so then what are you serving? Observing, it's like secretly spying on someone. You're spying? You mean like a secret agent? Correct, in fact I used to be one. You were a secret agent? Really? - Oh, that was ages ago. I was, I have a few tales I can tell you. But nobody wants to hear those stories these days. Being a spy must be tough. Well, anyway my mission is calling. So then, my pleasure meeting you both, yeah. Bye now. Bye, bye, Walter. - You believe it? - What? That he was once a spy? Why not? Some people were bus drivers or bakers or teachers. So it's possible that Walter was once a... A secret agent, yeah, yeah. - Mm hmm. - From what I'm seeing, well it's really so very, very - Who's that? - How can I say it? - What? It's so green! All these cute animals everywhere. Not true. In fact these animals are... Pichler! I hope I didn't exaggerate too much? Not at all. This zoo has a lot of potential. Yes, I think so. Potential? That's a word from math class. I forget what it means. Do you know that lady? No. Ah, Mr. Tierlieb. Ah, Mr. Mayor. Good news, I've given an assignment to Mrs. Zack here. She'll be modernizing this part. I see. That is big news. So when? We will begin organizing our plan of action this evening, alright? This evening? That's right, tonight. But shouldn't we take this slowly? I mean... - This should please you! This place hasn't made a profit in years. This is in the best interests of the tax payers and the zoo. You know as mayor, I face questions concerning the fact that this place costs us citizens money, so that has to change, yeah? Of course I understand that but... What the heck is this? What is that hole in the wall for? - Well. - Well? It's a free entrance for kids. - Oh. - Ah! All children should pay to get in. The sorry state of this place is why I've been hired here. Cheaper. What's needed here's a complete makeover! - Oh. - Hmm. There's so much open space, wow. The animals here seem lovely yet so do cat videos. But where's the video surveillance, the live chat, the interactive possibilities? We must look to the future, Mr. Tierlieb and there is something missing here. Bars and cages. Oh, those things aren't necessary here. You're a man with a sweet heart. But I'd say you're naive. Security here is a must. But our animals here are tame and peaceful. I'm concerned about your animals' welfare. I mean you certainly don't... Well I sure feel safe here, even without bars and cages. Since I've lived here, I've never felt afraid of anyone. The animals are doing great just the way they are. They don't need cages. Benjamin Blossom! I've heard great things about you. You have? Mm hmm and everything I've heard was good! You're big, you can speak, you're just terrific. So may I ask you, are you an animal or are you a manimal? - A what? - A mixture of man and animal. And who are you, kid? This is my best friend, Otto. He helps around here. We just finished repairing that bench over there. Oh, how cute. You're both cute little drops in the ocean. And I suppose you think you two drips can save the zoo? How awful! - We have to do something. - He just wants that banana! Calm down. You filthy ape! I'm very sorry Miss Zack. You are completely right. Things at the zoo must change. Wowee, she's supposed to fix the zoo? Well they said we have to keep up with the times here. Oh boy. It may not work well but at least it still works, huh? - Okay. - So, let's test this. It's sturdy as an elephant. Mm hmm. What did that Miss Zack lady mean when she called us drops in the ocean? 'Cause our zoo needs lots of money 'cause it's so broken down and we don't have enough funds to fix it. A silly bag's money can't fix up this place like you and I can. I know, so we just gotta keep working. But first let's have a bit of sugar. Something sweet always helps me to work better. Yeah, sure. Ah, afternoon Miss Meier. Nice to see you Mr. White. Yes, I... What's going on? Oh. Hmm. Miss Zack, what is this? My mobile center for my action plan for the zoo. Isn't it just wonderful? Oh, here are my two helper coworkers, Hans and Franz. Cool think tank, right? We all need clean space to think, mister. Creative visualization, brain waves. Yes, so here is a list with my suggestions for the improvements we need to... Changes. Believe me, I know exactly what changes are good and necessary. The more we can modernize the zoo, the better for everyone involved. I know you agree. I'm sure that's what the children want. So we will make them happy with a new playground that we'll call the entertainment place. Entertainment, oh. So that project's very promising. Yes, that really sounds very promising for us. - Mega. - And chill. Mega chill. Ooh whoop! Whoa, that thing's quite a set up, huh? Oh yeah, it's a folding out new thingamajig. And we're getting a new playground so that'll be nice. Hmm, I've got a bad feeling about those folks. I'm feeling great about this. They have no idea. They're naive. - They're so lame. - Yeah, lame losers. That's why we're here. We're going to dust off this run down zoo, shake it up and jolt it into the future. The zoo of tomorrow. Effective, modern, profit oriented. Small is the new big. Anything else would be wasting resources. Sharing space is important. And sharing resources is vital. People share cars, living space and employment. So these stupid animals can share enclosures too. Yo, enclosure sharing. So the animals get ignored, cool. And then very soon the zoo get a slick merchandising shop built and Keeper Karl's house will, ah, bye bye, be torn down to save more space. So he'll be forced to share a flat with old Tierlieb. And here comes the beautiful, expensive, luxury apartments. Right here, all with a view of the zoo lake. Wow, zoo shizzle dizzle. Zooer stylish. But shush, these dunderheads aren't completely convinced yet. As long as they don't know what we're doing, it's all the better for us. That's how we win, hmm? Selfie! Oh yes, and before I forget, there's this big, fat, talking elephant, that for us could be useful. - It works. - Great! - Hello there, Otto! - Mm hmm. As you can see, we're doing really well here. But your dad's afraid he'll never work again, 'cause he decided all he ever wants to do is lie down. I'm never getting up again. We miss you little guy! Hello! Oh, too bad you're not here soaking up the sun with us. But we're sure you're having fun too, huh? Son, we're really looking forward to hugging you and seeing you soon. And say hello to Benjamin for us. - Bye! - Toodaloo! They sure do miss you a lot, Otto. Mm, but I still can't imagine having more fun than being here. The zoo's a fun place to be. And I find it elephantastic that you're here too. Hmm. What's bothering you, Otto? It's that Miss Zack. Come on, she's gotta lotta cool stuff planned. I think she's actually quite nice. Hmm, I guess you're right. Wowee, hey tomorrow maybe we should try out the boat! Benjamin? Benjamin! Quit your snoring, will you? But I'm not snoring! Otto, look at this. Just what is that? I don't know. Let's go check it out. See, it's the early bird that gets things done. I'm thinking you two like to sleep in a little late, don't you? Sure. So what are you planning to tear down? Well, this place here is pretty old. - Yeah but... - And this is the beginning of creating something really nice. With merchandising and a lot of room for other things. So will all this be helping me too? Well aren't you part of our future? I've heard you've been unhappy for a while with this rickety feeder wagon and you complain about always having to work so hard. Well, I don't mean to. We'll brainstorm a solution to those problems. Your issues are at the top of my agenda. - Oh. Project ideas sound super. And you, I know you'll wanna pitch in to help your animal keeper friend, 'cause he needs to move in. - Mm hmm. Mr Tierlieb has lots of room where he lives to share his place. - Yes. - With Karl. - Uh. - What, excuse me? - Sure. - Us? Now if you'll excuse both of us, I need to have a chat with my elephant friend. - Oh? - Mm hmm. About what? About sugar treats for example. Why, sure! Hello! You know Benjamin, I get this feeling, I don't think you're being challenged enough here. I'm not? And you really have so much potential. If you get what I mean? But I'm not that good with math. Hmm and a sense of humor. Oh yeah, you have just what it takes to be the new face of of the Neustadt Zoo. CI, corporate identity. You are the zoo. - Who, me? Your face on their ticket to get in. We will sell action figures of you, Benjamin. Hover boards. Ears and trunks made of foam, the works! Everyone will come here for you. And the more zoo visitors there are, the more money. And who do you think that benefits? It benefits who? - It helps all of the animals. - Ah! - That's right. - Mm! Oh ho ho ho ho, so I am the zoo! That's true, you're it! With your face and help, we will save this zoo, you understand? Yeah? But of course, we'll have to give you a little bit of a, kind of, makeover. I mean the image of the little friendly elephant is a bit old fashioned. It's outdated. - It is? And the trumpeting. - Should I? - No! - Baruh! - No, no, no, no, no, no. - No? - Not that. - Not cool, dude. - Just not fancy enough. Really? I'm not sure this works. I think I'm a little too... Too fat for skinny jeans? - Mm. - No way, Benjamin, no! You are sturdy! Just the way that an elephant's supposed to be. These pants, let's stretch 'em. Then these work, like so. - Mm. - Mm? Mm hmm. - Mm mm! - Mm mm? Ow! Sorry for that. I'd say baggy jeans might fit you better, hmm? That's it, to the left, keep going, good. Where shall we put it? Maybe there? - Sure. - Or maybe over there. Where's Benjamin? We could use his help right now. Yeah, I mean how is all my stuff gonna fit in here? Well... And nothing against your taste, Boss, but I wouldn't exactly call this modern. Yeah, well when I was as young as she is, everything you see here was considered quite modern. I know, but well that was a long time ago. Huh? Sir, it's just for a little while. These pants definitely fit better, but... - Perfect! I don't know. No, no, no, no, this fits you a lot better. I'd say this style is targeting your market audience. But I barely recognize myself though. Exactly, Benjamin! You look wonderful now! In two days we'll have our first press conference to introduce you, that's when you'll be announced as our new face. With this new look? Mega face. Hey, Alfred! How'd he get in here? How cool! Oh yeah, cool monkey, say cheese! Hey, bad monkey, my camera! Alfred wants to be a photographer too! Get him out of here! - I got ya. - Hey! - I don't get it! - Now come on! One of us comes from the right, the other one from the left, right? From the left? - Easy enough? - Okay, got it. Alfred, come back! I wanna see those pictures! You two, was that the same camera you took photos with yesterday? Photos of our new zoo model? Photos, yeah it's possible I guess. You worthless idiots! What are you waiting for? Go after him, chop, chop! Okay. Hey, Benjamin. Oh wow. What an outfit. - It's the new CIA, uh CGI. - Wow. I mean corpulent identities. Whatever that means. Yeah, that's it. How does this dart gun work anyway? You, dimwit, it's a tranquilizer gun. Just aim it and pull the trigger. Hey, what are they up to? They're probably looking for Alfred. With a tranquilizer dart gun? I guess so. - Let's go try to find out. - Yes, go! - Yeah! - Sure. - Okay. - That's what we'll do. Alfred! That sounds just awful! A tranquilizer gun has never been used while I have been at this zoo. I agree completely because I am a great pacifist. At the tone, the time is 11:23 a.m. I can't reach her, but this means war. You can count on me, you'll see. I could count on you in the future, if you would check first with me and we discuss things. We will discuss things first, Mr. Tierlieb Thank you. Alfred, Alfred! Alfred, there you are, buddy. Come to me. Wait! Yo, you, aren't you a friend of that talking elephant? Huh? By any chance did you see Alfred near here? No way, I'm just talking a walk. Ah, young kids don't ever go for walks, do they? Yeah, actually kids would rather play video games. Shh, did you hear that? I'm sure it's just a... - Alfred! - Oh yeah! Hey, hold on! Wait, you can't do that! Alfred! Come on, Alfred! No, don't! That sounds like Otto! He's harmless, stop! Looks like they're gonna shoot Alfred! I won't let them! - Hey! - Quit it, stop! - No, stop it! - Come on, Hans, do it! I'm on it, move! Don't shoot Alfred! Teroo! Oops. Enough! Oh man, I think he's sleeping. Oh, Franz. I'll get help. - Someone brings me calm. - Sorry, Zora. Amateur! It's important that you catch that darn monkey! That camera's pictures can't fall into the wrong hands! Out of the way, old man! Who's an old man? Idiot! Relax, schnippy, you're alright. Hey, hello. Cool party, huh? You live near here? Hey, why are you two upside down? Clean this up. Shot in the behind? Sensational, sounds like a great headline. What about the other stuff? They tore down our house and dressed him in clothes that aren't his style. It's just a different look. Exactly, after all, Otto, you're always wearing yellow and blue. Yellow and blue. But my new clothes are fancy! - Huh? - Miss Zack told me this, looking hip and cool will attract a lot more zoo customers. And more visitors mean more money. - She said that? - Mm hmm. And her guys were hunting for Alfred with a dart stun gun. Miss Zack was very sorry about that. - That woman... - Walter! Doesn't seem like she's actually sorry about anything she's doing. I have a bad feeling about that lady. Better to keep a watchful eye on her than wind up with a black eye. It's pure espionage. Information is the key to judging her and her motives. Oh that sounds heavy handed. But you may be right about investigating. I'll see what I can find out. Neustadt is now more modern and livable. My dear friends, friends of Neustadt, the election for our town's mayor is approaching fast and I can only say, don't believe anyone except me, you see. Only me, I mean, I mean you should... My dear. Oh, that's just what I need. Pichler, Pichler! Pichler! Yes. I need absolute quiet. Good! Don't let her in here, got it? Who? That girl, the snoopy journalist. She's coming, just tell her I'm away. Hello, there, let the mayor know I'm here. Oh, Mr. Mayor. No time. Pichler, come on. Today, a crane arrived at the zoo to demolish a building. Your thoughts on modernization through demolition? What do I think of it? - I asked you. - And what do you think? I think things are happening there that haven't been approved by the zoo occupants or Mr. Tierlieb. That's what you think? Yes and why do you think Alfred Ape is being hunted with a dart gun? - What do you think I think? - I think you think you can weasel your way out of this. If that's what you wanna think I think, well I've gotta go. Ah, Mr. Mayor, don't get lost running away from my zoo questions. Sure, blah blah blah blah blah. Pichler, come on! - Tell me, Otto? - Hmm? Does it bother you that Miss Zack is so nice to me but she's not so nice to you? What? That's nonsense. I know you care and want to make the zoo a better place too. Yeah but not in the weird way she does. You're not suspicious of her? Sure I am. Sometimes once you really get to know people, they aren't like what you think they are. Yeah, but she's what I think she is. But even wearing those weird clothes you have on, I still like you just the way you are. I like you just the way you are too. You're my best buddy, Otto. Hmm.

Shot in the behind, shot in the behind! Read it all here, all the amazing new zoo happenings! Shot in the behind! - Hey there, I'll take one of those please. - Read all about it! Shot in the behind! Either the mayor is playing dumb or he really is that stupid, but with him, who knows. But then I did learn something about Miss Zack that's interesting. You did? She changed over the Neustadt Candy Factory into a pear factory. - She did? - Yeah. You mean that factory that makes those biter cough tablets? - Yup. - Huh? Yeah Benjamin, they taste even worse than dill pickles with cinnamon dew. - Ugh! - It's a liver flavored watermelon that's in a cough drop. - Ugh, yuck! - Hmm mm. Hey, what are you doing with that? That's our favorite hammock! Hey, is that Alfred? Oh ho ho, there he is. And Alfred still has that camera that's Miss Zack's. That must be why those nuts were hunting him with a dart stun gun! You're right and they're still looking for him. Know what I think? It's not just about getting back that camera. That's what I'm thinking. Alfred, could you please come down? Yeah, come! He's sure having fun hanging on to that camera. But I know something Alfred likes even better. What is it? Oh yeah. Alfred, trade you this for that camera? Thank you, Alfred. I don't believe this! There's Miss Zack. And is that our zoo? It can't be, what are those giant houses doing on the zoo's lake? Good question. Those houses look huge. How weird. Sensational, what will Miss Zack have to say about this? - Hello. - Oh my! What the heck is this then? Who would do such a thing? Unbelievable. Don't worry, little girl, we'll see you get out. Please move back a bit. Thank you, Benjamin! Oh, you're welcome. Have a good time at the zoo. Thanks! Many zoo residents are having to resist in somewhat confrontational ways. Changing zoo animals' attitudes. Now one for the camera please. And very nice. When will this stop? Actually these kinds of cages are for sick animals. For isolating them. - Yeah. And they're not designed to hold animals for a long time. Oh, this is just a temporary measure until the new enclosures are ready. We wouldn't want our bulldozers flattening our furry friends. Before you do anything, you need to check with me first! She won't because she has really different plans than you. Benjamin, my dearest friend. What's going on with you? You didn't respect my trumpeting ban, did you? No more trumpeting? Well, I did it. Here, here's the evidence! - Oh, my camera! - Hey! Oh, oh my, why it's completely out of date! May I see those pictures? Deleted! It was just some stupid old ideas, not important. So you want to improve the zoo by building more and pushing the residents out, that's your plan? No, the only thing I wanna do is improve conditions for everyone. My own state of the art robotic creation. A feeding machine with it's fuzzy logic, it nutritionally calculates the exact amount of food an animal needs, so, there's no more waste. Scanning primate, Barbary ape, weight nine kilograms. Calculating food amount. Dispatching. Super, the ideal feed calculator. Superior cutting edge technology, that's what we call progress. Scanning primate, Homo sapiens, calculating, calculating. - No, no, no, no, stop! Dispensing. - Dispensing. - Stop, stop! How do... - Dispensing. - Hans, Franz! - Uh oh! - Quit it! - Dispensing. Stop, off! We're still in the test phase. You, stop! Trust me, this feeding robot is part of my grandiose and special plan. And what plan is that please? Saving the Neustadt Zoo. Come on! Can't you see she's misleading us here? Somehow we've got to prove exactly what she's doing. Not easy. Hmm, there's only one person that can help us with this. Are you sure this is where Walter White lives? That's what Mrs. Meier said. Besides, look at this place. I mean you can see it's like a real secret agent's mansion. Well I'm not convinced. Uh oh! Oh. Password? Hello Walter, we just wanted to ask if we... Password! So what's the password? - And how should I know? - Password please! I've got no clue! Then just guess. Sugar treat? Huh? Oh! - Ah! Huh? So, the elephant and his human friend. Welcome to my headquarters. Hello Walter. So the password was really sugar treats? Well to be perfectly honest, I forgot the password for that door a long time ago. - What? - Yeah. Would you like a nice cup of hot cocoa? Why sure! With plenty of extra sugar in it please. Well, maybe later. We're here because we could really use a couple of your secret, secret agent tips. Well, yeah, I'm done with that spy stuff now. Oh but, oh well, why not. Follow me. Now to open this extremely high security lock, you need a twelve figure combination of numbers. And also two fingerprints and an iris scan. Or you just press on the super secret button I have. A ha! Ha ha, cool! Huh? Whoa! Huh? Oh, this room looks just like the one I came in from! Benjamin, are you coming? Huh? Oh, wow look at this! Oh! I can't believe it. These photos of you. So you're were what you said, a... A secret agent! Crazy! Wow, a remote controlled submarine! With a camera and dolphin sonar. It can reach the deepest depth of the ocean. - You mean seven miles deep? - Mm hmm. Huh, what's with this watch? Oh, it has many features. There's a hidden camera in it, radar, a shortwave radio and it can also tell you what time it is. A watch that tells time? So is there a hidden microphone in these flowers? No, no, actually that is well, more of a private project. With all this stuff you've got here, I bet we could sneak right into Miss Zack's office! What? Sneak into Miss Zack's? Oh, Otto, you want to break in there? What? Not break in, no! We don't want to steal anything. We just wanna look around. So we can see if the zoo model in that photo really was only an old idea. No, Benjamin, she lied to you. She lies all the time. You can't believe a woman who ordered you to stop trumpeting. That's part of who you are. That's true. Let's see if there's something we can use in here. - Ooh! - Whoa! Help yourselves. Ha ha, yeah! Oh dear. Even saving everything we can, we'll be broke soon without help from outside sources. I don't feel like it's my place to give advice but if the budget books look anything like this then... Huh. That was weird. What is this? Toothbrush water. Oh, interesting. We need to sneak into her lab without being seen by those cameras. - Copy that. - Copy what? Just do what I do! Otto, all clear, come on over! Wow, I guess that's another way to do it. Okay, now we just need to get in there. Mm, I smell sugar cubes. Focus, Benjamin, concentrate. But Otto, I mean I smell sugar cubes that are inside. If I can smell them from here, that means... There's an open window! Great, Benjamin! Where exactly? Up there. A skylight, of course! But how are we gonna get up there? No problem. Oh! Oi, oi, oi. That's really high. You wanna find out what's going on or not? Huh, oh. Here we go. I don't know. Benjamin, get up here! I'll be right there. It should probably only take about five hours. Oh, Otto, watch it! Maybe you should use two ropes. Oh come on, I'm not that fat. Oh. So much for keeping our zoo. Ooh! I guess I'm heavier than I thought after all. So far, so good. Right. Miss Zack, this was just a silly prank by a curious young boy and a friendly elephant. Always sticking together, hmm? I'm not sure I can support your zoo any longer. So you're threatening me? But he didn't have anything to do with this! Benjamin and me thought of it. Oh really? I think it's much more likely that you, dear Benjamin, had Otto persuade you to join him in breaking in here. Well, I... I get the distinct feeling your little friend doesn't know what's right or good for you. And as for our beautiful new zoo and great plans, Otto knows much less about them than you do. Oh yeah? We'll see. I saw the model of your beautiful new zoo here. Really? And just what model is that? Benjamin you saw it too, right? Everything went so fast. It was dark and I was coming down and then the rope broke! You should have used two ropes like I was telling you to. Oh man, I always do everything wrong. So he meant that you're fat? - What? - No, I'd never say that to you. What did you mean then? Let's calm down, okay? Friends just don't say things like that. They don't, never, mm mm. Wait a sec, tell me Benjamin, are we still friends or what? I didn't say anything like that! So you'd rather be her friends instead of mine? Now you're saying that kind of stuff again. Oh man, everything was so peaceful before. But now it's all fighting and strife. Oh sure, and that's my fault, you think? No, I didn't, it's nobody's fault. I really was too naive. I thought all this time, having a real elephant like you as my best friend, could work out. What? Otto! Oh boy, oh boy. What have I gone and done now. Neither of them have said a single word. Benjamin, hi there! - Benj... - Benjamin, Benjamin! Mm hmm! That fat, good for nothing elephant. He still won't talk. We've tried peanuts and everything. I know what will work. I've got some news about Otto! Big news to share! Oh, my dear one. Come, sit down. So what's going on with Otto? Oh, it's bad. Otto, I don't think he's coming back here. So that was your big news? No, now let us begin. Once again, starting right where we left off before. Tomorrow is our press conference. So let's see if we can visualize a new trademark image for that. Wait, that wasn't any news from Otto, you were just lying to me! Lying to you? Benjamin, I'd never do such a... Otto said you lied to me and I didn't believe him! But I'm not helping you anymore! Whoa, remain calm. I'm not gonna do anything! That elephant's the bomb! And from here on, I'll trumpet when I want! Teroo, teroo! - Shush, enough! - Teroo! - Alright, you win! - Teroo! I understand. And you should. Let's make peace, mm hmm? Please sit. - Hmm. Sweets for the sweet? Mm hmm. Hmm. I'll get Otto to come back and in the future, every step I discuss with you right here. Agreed? - Mm hmm, hmm. And for doing that, we'll be good friends again, hmm? I know humans and elephants can't be real friends! I see, no friendship then? I need to have a moment to myself, alone. And meanwhile, you can quietly think over my suggestion. Hmm. Hello, what are you working on? Well this is. So much for this one. And yes, this one. Wait a minute, so tell me. Did the Zack lady get a new workplace for herself? I'm not exactly sure. Oh, wait I have something for you to see. Take a look, this here is not a normal walking cane. Uh huh. See this little opening right here? Mm hmm. Watch closely, get ready. Then! Wow. So what's happened that has you so down? I guess it's a friendship thing. Ah, Benjamin? Huh, he's an elephant. - Of course! - And he'll only be your friend if you give him treats like sugar. Ah, not trusting that you have a true friend isn't a good thing either. When I was younger and working, I was always out there on the road, traveling all over the world, meeting all kinds of people. Ladies, nice people, yes. But I never had a really good friend in all those years. Then you don't know what I mean, hmm. Yes of course, but I do know that sometimes people break up with their friends, whether that friend is an elephant or not. It happens, doesn't it? Sure! That stubborn elephant! He's fighting it! I know I shouldn't be talking, but why are we whispering? You say you won't talk but you just keep talking! What? Silence! No more talking! Sorry, I didn't wanna talk but the silence was... Uh, mm mm! Only seconds away from nap time. - Mm. - One, two, goodnight! You think that really worked? Of course. He could be awake and just playing possum. Can a talking elephant do something that clever? Idiots, go, chop, chop! Get rid of the elephant! I have to prepare for the press conference, bye bye. Oh shizzle, the elephant's too heavy. Go on, push! - What? Why me? 'Cause I crank better than you. I crank just as well as you. Check out this dog vid, man. Ha, a pirate pug, how rad is that? Wow, that's amazing. - Check it, there's more! - Ar! Benjamin, what's up? It's your friend 'tto here. That liquid stuff looks lousy. How 'bout I feed you some real food. Karl! Alfred, did you just talk to me? Hey, Karl. Otto, I just thought Alfred was talking to me. No one's been feeling too good since you and Benjamin aren't getting along. Yeah, do you know where he is? Oh sure, he's over at Zack's. - What? - Yeah. Well who do we have here? Hi, little guy. Where's Benjamin? Didn't anyone tell you yet? No, tell me what? Oh, I guess not. Well there's no surprise. He's left. What? Gone, maybe for good. He figured he needs time off. He must want a better life for him. But why would you care? He knows you don't. - Uh uh. - Oh yeah. He was so disappointed in you. But you know, he said humans and elephants can never be friends. She is lying! Benjamin wouldn't leave just because of some stupid fight. Would he? No, he wouldn't, really. Never, I know Benjamin, he wouldn't. Yeah, he'd never just leave. But it is rather strange. We should look for him. ♪ In a beautiful green meadow ♪ There's a big gray mountain ♪ Stretches his legs up to the sky ♪ ♪ Next to him there is a dwarf ♪ No the dwarf is Otto ♪ And the mountain an elephant ♪ He is friendly and can speak ♪ And everybody knows him ♪ And we're asking everybody ♪ Have you seen Benjamin Excuse me, have you seen Benjamin? - No, sorry. - I haven't seen him. Excuse me, have you seen Benjamin? The talking elephant that lives here, he's missing. Have you seen Benjamin Blossom? He's missing. So, the mayor, is he going to help out? Haven't seen him. Appears he's unavailable. - Ah. - Even Pichler can't be found. That's very strange. Alright I'm on it. Have you seen Benjamin Blossom? Benjamin, just where are you? - There he is! - Hey there! - Well aloha! - Hey! Hey. - We wanted to call to say goodnight. - Can you see how beautiful this is? Hey, everything good, Otto? - Sure. - You seem a little sad, son. I'm not, I'm just a bit tired. Yes, Otto has the best friend in the world, Benjamin. So, you two having fun? I miss Benjamin. - What? - Huh? - What's that son? - Nothing. I'm doing fine. But I feel really dead tired. Bye bye. - You get some good rest. - Okay. - Our best to Benjamin. - Cheers! Benjamin! Karl, Karl, Mr. Tierlieb! Hello? Otto? I think Benjamin was in the van! - What? - What are you talking about? Hans and Franz had this van and they were leaving. I didn't think about it, but that was the day he disappeared. Maybe Benjamin could have been in there. Calm down, that's crazy talk. How could that happen? Yes but good friends sometimes sense things like that. - Yeah? - Yeah. Okay, then I should help you. That alright? - Yeah. But wait, not in pajamas! - Oh yeah, great, good. - Some clothes! Be right back. Be careful now. Where could that van be? Wait, this is the van! Yeah. I think I can reach in. Yeah. It's them! Shabizzle my dizzle, my back hurts, ow. Well no wonder, you had that half ton guy right on top of you. And you were the idiot who wound up getting stuck under him. Bingo. Otto, I've found something. That's his hat. See this wrapper? Wow, trash. No, it's, the mayo's still fresh. They must have bought it this morning. From the Albatross. Isn't that by the, The harbor! Karl, can't we go any faster? I've got it to the floor but this thing's just too old. I was supposed to get a new one from Miss Zack soon. No, better forget about that. Mm hmm. - Karla! - Guys, what is it? We're heading to the harbor. We think Benjamin was grabbed and taken there. What? So our friend was kidnapped? That makes sense. Let's meet up at the harbor. - Good. - See you there. Where is Benjamin? Where is Benjamin? Where is Benjamin? Where is Benjamin? Where is Benjamin? Where is Benjamin? We did warn you Zora. Quiet and clean, you putz. Where is Benjamin? Where is Benjamin? Psst, psst. Where is Benjamin? Where is Benjamin? - Hey! Where is Benjamin? Where is Benjamin? Where is Benjamin? Where is Benjamin? Where is Benjamin? Where is Benjamin? Where is Benjamin? Where is Benjamin? Where is Benjamin? This isn't exactly the greatest place to talk, Mayor. And just where would you suggest we speak? It's total chaos with these Benjamin Blossom nuts. They should all be put in jail. Well, Mr. Mayor, all citizens have a right to express their opinion freely. That's article five of the... - Quiet, enough. Your whole idea was to shrink the zoo and make it more efficient and clear out more room for high rise, high rise condos. Naturally. Say something, Pichler! - I... - We feel that... Something sensible. You must know that well, what long term consequences, this kind of negative press has, have. Yes, how can we survive and protect 'em, protect us? How do we survive this and protect them? I say by building the citizens of Neustadt a new zoo. They will love those tall buildings - Oh blah blah blah blah blah. and beautiful high rise condos. - Shush! - Shh, what he's trying to say... - I want peace and quiet in this whole... - Shh! You know I must stay mayor, got it? I want to only hear good news about the zoo and great stuff about me. And I hope you don't have anything to do with Benjamin's disappearance or you're done! Your contract with us will be torn up and forgotten. Pichler, come on. You should bring Benjamin back to smooth things out. Are you insane? At noon that's ship will shove off and then our big gray problem will be gone for good. You mean you're gonna get rid of him? Wait, by ship? What did you dummies think was the plan? That he was just gonna chill out in that container at the port? No. Benjamin is going on a long voyage. He's been bought by a rich Chinese collector. Maybe he'll like it better there. Oh. Worthless, you're amateurs and losers. Excuse me! Did you happen to serve food to a tall, skinny guy with a mustache? And another shorter guy with a cap and mustache? Two guys like that? They ate here this morning. That's great, cool. And did you notice an elephant with them? What you mean a big fat one wearing a hat, with huge ears and gray skin? Yeah! You've got a really wild imagination! Now go play somewhere else, I'm working here. - Otto, Karl, follow me. - Karla! Okay. Said I should call you if anyone gets too nosy. Yeah, got it. Yeah, I'll handle it. Okay, so now just where at the harbor would you hide an elephant around here? Why sure, in a shipping container! - Yeah of course. - Right! There's so many. Yeah, which one could it be? Yeah, we'd better look around. Sounds good. - Mr. Blossom? - Benjamin! Benjamin, Benjamin? Benjamin? Mr. Blossom? Benjamin? Benjamin? Benjamin? Benjamin? Benjamin? Benjamin? Benjamin? How am I ever gonna find him? Benjamin? Benjamin! There's this red headed kid, 'bout this tall. He must be somewhere. - Yikes. - Hey, did you hear that? Let's go search back there again. You take the left, I'll take the right. Benjamin? Benjamin! Benjamin, wake up! You alright? Otto! Yeah, I'm fine. I'm just really tired. Don't worry, you'll both get a nice rest on the long boat ride you got coming. Bon voyage from Zora Zack! This isn't good. You can say that again. This isn't good! Thank you. What's going on, an earthquake? Well? No trace of Benjamin, you? No, not a trace. So where's Otto? Looking from back there, I suppose. Then let's wait right here for him, hmm? - Cool. - Mm hmm. Oh, hi there. Are you hoping he'll come home too? Hopefully they'll find him and bring back Benjamin really soon. Why are we doing all this moving around? No idea. So what's that noise? My guess is that they must have put us on a ship. I think you're right about that. So then where are we going? We're going nowhere! We gotta get to the zoo and save it! I'm with you on doing that. We gotta save it. But how? There, Benjamin! Can you push that out? No problem! There! - Super, Benjamin! I see Karla and Karl! Karla, Karl! Karl! Darn, they can't hear me. Let me try. Teroo! Even that didn't work. They can't hear us. What are we gonna do? Hey, by any chance do you happen to have a sugar cube in your pocket? Come on, Benjamin, this is not time... - Otto! Do you trust me? Sure. I mean, why of course I trust you. You'll have to aim my trunk and make the shot. I can't see anything. Benjamin, what an idea! Now! - Huh? - What is it? Something hard just hit me! Hit you where? On my neck, just now. Hey, that's weird. It's a sugar cube. Benjamin! Benjamin, Benjamin? Hey there, we're up here! There's Otto! And a trunk! - Hello! - Benjamin, Benjamin, hey! Hey, we're up here! The ship's leaving now. We need to stop it then! There! You must stop that ship from leaving! What, absolutely not. There is a kidnapping victim on board! Wait, someone's been kidnapped? Trust me, I'm a reporter. Ooh. Stop your ship, don't weigh anchor, you have kidnapped hostage on board. - He's big! - He is big. - And he's fat! - And he's fat. He's got a trunk. And he's got a, a what? A big trunk! Yeah? Yeah! In case you're writing a story, my name's Bruno Bowings, spelled like it sounds. They stopped us from leaving! Phew. - That was close. - Too close. - So Otto. - Yes? I have a big question. Am I still your friend? No. You're my very best friend! I'm sorry for what I said. So am I. That mean Miss Zack is gonna be sorry. I'm just hoping we're not too late. Me too. And because we sadly, sadly don't know Benjamin Blossom's whereabouts right now, he made a choice not to be the trademark face of this zoo. So we move on. This whole thing stinks to high heaven. Benjamin would never leave our zoo in need. Benjamin belongs here at the zoo. - Yes, that's true. - Bring Benjamin back! I guarantee this, even without Benjamin, the new zoo here in Neustadt, will enrich and make proud, all the citizens of Neustadt. And now comes a great moment in the future of this zoo and city. Mr. Mayor, I now request you sign the contract. Miss Zack. Please, after you. Just sign right there. Go ahead. No! Will you sign it already? Don't sign it, don't! Miss Zack drugged and kidnapped Benjamin! What nonsense! It's not nonsense. She put me the sleep with tainted sugar cubes! She's been exploiting poor Benjamin and his weakness for sugar. - Yeah! - Don't put our zoo's future in her evil hands. She'll stop at nothing. She has no proof of this. No proof at all! None, no, nothing at all! Do you have any real evidence for these allegations? - Not really. - You see? So which part do I need to push, Mrs. Meier? Mr. White, they can hear you. Oh ho, that voice, it's Walter! My, you look extra lovely, Mrs. Meier. Walter, they can all hear you. Is that so? Ah, oh well. Let's just press this. The following recordings I taped, prove the evil doings of the criminal, Miss Zack. Her little game is over. Right. That's supposed to be evidence, huh? That's ridiculous. - Yes, ridiculous. Switch off that old fool and let's finish up. Yeah. Oh, right, here it is. You should bring Benjamin back to smooth things out. Hey that's me! For heavens sake, at noon that ship will shove off and then our big, gray problem will be gone for good. Ship, what ship? - You mean get rid of him? - It doesn't mean a thing. What did you dummies think was the plan? That he was just gonna chill out in that container at the port? No, Benjamin is going on a long voyage. That's not me. He's been bought by a rich, Chinese collector. Maybe he'll like it better there. I have something to say. Ladies and gentleman, I have had nothing to do with this. Hey idiots, start the wrecking ball! - No. - Not today. Chop, chop, or you'll both be fired! You can forget it. We quit! Honestly, then I'll do it myself. - Wait! - No! Oh no, she's unleashing the wrecking ball! I will laugh last! Benjamin! Oh no! Ha, got him. Oh dear me! The ball! Watch out! Here it comes again! Watch it! Mr. Tierlieb! Oh boy! That's enough. Stop that ball, go! You okay? Yeah. Now that's how you stop a wrecking ball, see? So much for Neustadt, ha, a town of losers! You can do what you want with your zoo. I'm checking out! Alfred! You meddling, stupid monkey! Oh! That's not the smell of success! That goes to the gorillas. Yeah, exactly. Okay, take this load to the rhino enclosure for their new roof, thanks. Oh, thanks, Schnippy. My yellow paint just ran out. Thank you so much. And in about an hour, I'll need some white paint, alright? So, have I ever told you about the time I paddled through the sewers of Moscow in a canoe? It was there that I met up with this crocodile that was as long as a train, as tall as a ladder and as wide as a bus. There we go, that's it. Looks great. I'd say all those drops in the ocean really add up. When everyone pitches in, things happen. So Mayor, have you learned from your mistakes and could you explain why all Neustadt citizens now have a say in the design of the zoo? This zoo's importance is huge to me. And thanks to my intelligence, generous support and leadership, we have not only been able to redo, to completely fix the zookeeper's house, so that it's truly fine, all the enclosures and the playgrounds were also refurbished thanks to my, Pichler? Yes, it's amazingly gratifying what you've done and you do belong in the zoo. Indeed. So the citizens of Neustadt can now rest assured that's you will always represent their interests over big business in the future? - Represent is way too weak a word. - Does he ever stop talking? - I'll do my best and more. - Alfred! Now you have your home back and your old swing. Wowee, look at that! Hey dudes, check us out! You like our red, ice, ice, baby style? Awesome, right? - Sure! What do you think about our new Softee 3000, huh? Wait, this was a feeding robot designed by Miss Zack! - Wowee, whoa! We made some sweet improvements. Yeah, a rad modification. Insane upgrade. 2.0. Ah! There's just one thing left to do. And you're the only one who can do it, Benjamin!
