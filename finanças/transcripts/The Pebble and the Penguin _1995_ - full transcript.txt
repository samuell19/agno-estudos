FEMALE NARRATOR: There is a charming tradition observed by the Adelie penguins. Once a year, during the mating season, all the male birds gather on the Antarctic beaches, and there, each selects an extraordinary pebble. With pebble in hand, each male presents his precious gift to the lady he most desires. If she accepts it, they mate for life. ♪ One perfect pebble ♪ Just one humble stone ♪ But, oh, what a stone ♪ Can do ♪ It means that I have one love forever ♪ And one love alone ♪ A now and forever with you ♪ Now and forever ♪ I'll show her I care ♪ I'll find her the rarest stone ♪ And maybe if the pebble is perfect ♪ She'll tell me right there ♪ She's now and forever ♪ My own Hey.

It's so romantic.Knock it off. Romance has nothing to do with it. Listen. You know, I don't think a pebble should be that important. Marina, if you don't care about the pebble, how will you choose? How will you know if it's Mr. Right? MARINA: ♪ I will know when, Gwynne ♪ 'Cause it's not the pebble ♪ It's the penguin ♪ Now and forever ♪ His heart will be true ♪ That's how I'll know who he is ♪ No matter if his pebble is clever ♪ Or borrowed or blue ♪ I'll now and forever be his Wow! ♪ Do you take this pebble ♪ Now and forever ♪ Do you take this penguin ♪ Now and forever ♪ Do you ♪ I do ♪ We will grow old together ♪ Cozy and cold together ♪ We'll try our best together ♪ Now and forever ♪ As sure as the snow ♪ As long as the ocean roars ♪ I'll love you in a way ♪ That I'll never ♪ Begin to outgrow ♪ I'll now and forever ♪ Be yours FEMALE NARRATOR: Of all the penguins in all the world, the most romantic was Hubie. He had a secret love in his life, Marina, the most beautiful girl penguin in the rookery. Hi, Hubie. Tell us a story. Yes. A love story. Oh, that's mushy stuff. Oh, Beany! [SCOFFS] Well, once there was a penguin who fell in love with the most beautiful girl penguin in the whole rookery. Did she love him back? They never even met. You see, he was painfully shy. Well, one day, he--he just swam up to her and said, "Hello, Marina. I'm Hubie, and I think you're fabulous." [ALL LAUGHING] [SIGHING] Who am I k-kidding? [STUTTERING] I mean, I never even talked to the girl. [SCREAMING] [SCREAMING] [STUTTERING] Goodness glaciers! Marina! [CHUCKLING] So, it wasn't an avalanche. That was some landing, Hubie. [GROANS] [STUTTERING] I'm sorry, Marina. I'm just so clumsy. MARINA: Oh, don't be silly, Hubie. [BOTH CHUCKLING] FEMALE NARRATOR: But someone else had his eye on the fair Marina. Drake, an evil penguin who always got his way. That little wimp. I'll knock the s-stutter right out of him. Marina doesn't know it yet, but she's going to be my wife. Our children will be the strongest, the smartest, the bravest, not to mention the best looking. Why, they'll be just like me. [LAUGHING] [GROWLS] I'm telling you, boys, Marina is as good as mine. MARINA: This is quite a spot, Hubie. What do you do up here? Well, um, [CLEARS THROAT] [STUTTERING] I wonder about stuff. Stuff? What kind of stuff? I just... No. You'd think it was silly. I bet it's not silly at all. Try me. ♪ Sometimes I wonder ♪ What the colors mean ♪ Why the sea is g-green ♪ Like your eyes [GASPS] I'm sorry. Go on. ♪ Sometimes I wonder ♪ Why the moon is new ♪ Where the stars are shooting to ♪ When they're shooting through ♪ The skies ♪ There's wondrous things ♪ That I would like to know ♪ Like how they make the waves ♪ And turn the tides ♪ And then I wonder why ♪ I wonder so ♪ While other guys are busy ♪ Choosing brides Oh, where was I?

NARRATOR: The full moon mating ceremony was fast approaching. The rookery buzzed with excitement. All the bachelors took to the beaches to find their engagement pebbles. And none was more determined than Hubie. He dove, scrambled, scrapped and raced against the best of them. But try as he might, Hubie couldn't hold on to a single pebble.It's mine. [PANTING] I've nothing. Poor Hubie. With the day almost done, and the beach picked clean of the best engagement stones, how could he ever hope to find the perfect pebble for his perfect love, Marina? "Star light, star bright First star I see tonight "Wish I may, wish I might Have the wish I wish tonight" [HUMMING] ♪ Now and forever ♪ I'll show her I care ♪ I'll find her ♪ The rarest s-s-stone ♪ And maybe if the pebble is... ♪ [GASPS] Wow. [CHUCKLES] Oh, my. It's perfect. Marina! Has anyone seen Marina? I got to find her. I just got to find her. Wait till she sees this. It's perfect. Perfect! MALE PENGUIN: Hey, what's the holdup? Somebody saw a leopard seal. Oh, not today. I'm starving. So, nerd. I hear you want to be a big ladies' man. Marina is mine. [STUTTERING] You big bully! Wake up and smell the seaweed, you little fool. Nobody's going to marry a loser like you. Now give me that stupid pebble. No, it's for Marina. [LAUGHS] Hope you can swim better than you can t-talk. Bye, Hubie. Sleep with the fishes. [SCREAMS] [DRAKE LAUGHING] Hi, guys. Hey, look. The water's safe. Let's eat. Oh, boy. Hubie! Hubie! Hubie! [SCREAMS] [PANTING] MARINA: Hubie! HUBIE: Marina! FEMALE NARRATOR: Huddled against the wind and buffeted by the storm, Hubie was swept far away to warmer waters where there lived an enemy even greater than the leopard seal. Man. FEMALE PENGUIN: So sweet. MALE PENGUIN: Oh, look. I think he's coming around. Welcome back, lad. Where am I? You're aboard the good ship Misery. You've been sleeping for nearly three days now. Three days? I've been asleep for three days? I'm sure Marina thinks I'm lost forever. Marina? My girl back home. [CHUCKLING] Why, you're our first Adelie. What's your name? Yes. Yes. What's your name? I'm Hubie. Welcome aboard, Hubie. Although, "welcome" probably isn't the appropriate word. Outrage! That's the appropriate word.Yes. Abomination. The indignity.The indignity.

Let's get him down below. Open the door, man. Open the door. Hold still, lad, or I'll give you a fist in the beak. Now get in there and stay there. Come back here, you yellow-bellied landlubbers. Take a breather, laddie. That door will be there later. I can promise you that. Save it, old-timer. Nobody locks up Rocko the Rockhopper. Those humans just did. Hey. When I get out of here, you're seal bait. What are you staring at, birdbrain? That's Hubie, and he's heartbroken. Yes. He was snatched away from the lady he loves. Poor, poor pebblehead. If he had any guts, he never would've let them take him alive. So, where is this floating scrapheap headed, anyway? Our destination would be difficult to determine at this juncture. That means he doesn't know.That means he doesn't know. Well, we be in warm waters. We be in Bora Bora, Pops. I know where we are. Where do we dock? That's what I'm asking. Where do we dock? We can't say for sure, lad, but I've heard stories of sailors selling penguins to zoos. Zoos? Zoos? I'm not going to no zoo. No, no. I'm going to the helmsman. I'll go to the first mate. I'll go all the way to the captain of this oversized dinghy. I'll make him turn this tug around if I have to. But I can't go to a z-zoo. I've got to get back to Antarctica. Who's with me? Who's for busting out of here? Come on, you jellyfish. How about you, seal bait? You? Sorry, Mr. Rockhopper, but free food at the zoo sounds awful good to me. ROCKO: Bunch of birdbrains and seal bait. Get me out of here! Get me somebody! WOMAN 1: Marina, Hubie is gone. Face it. Forget him. WOMAN 2: Why don't you just marry Drake? No, Priscilla. I believe Hubie is still out there somewhere, and he'll come home to me in time for the full moon mating ceremony. You're saying you want to marry him? I do. How could you possibly choose a wimp like Hubie over a hunk like Drake? Hubie's a sweetheart. He's generous and kind, and he's always thoughtful of others, and... Good morning, ladies. [ALL SIGHING] Marina, my pet. I want you to be my mate. Drake. Drake. I love Hubie. Hubie? I deeply sympathize, Marina, but since he is nowhere to be found, I offer my own hand. My answer is still no. Think about it. Give me your answer later. But remember. You must choose a mate before the full moon mating ceremony or be banished. Gosh. That's the law. I got just 10 days to get back home before the full moon ceremony. Sir! Sir! Take me with you. You talking to me?Yes, sir, I am. Don't call me "sir." Call me Rocko. Rocko. Right. Yes. Well, Rocko, it's about my girl. Wait, wait, wait. You want me to spring you out of this joint so you can go home to Miss Wonderful, right? Yes. Yes. You're right. You see, there's another guy who's after my girl. Forget it.But a moment ago, you asked who's for busting out of here. Well, I am.You're too dumb. Take me, please.Why should I? [STUTTERING] Well, because if the humans see me tripping all over myself, that'll divert their attention to me, giving you more time to escape. Like I really need a diversion. I could squawk and yell and make horrible noises. [GROANING] [LAUGHING] Well, you made me laugh. Give me a chance, please. I'll bring the house down. What's your name?Hubie. Well, uh, Hubie. All right. You're on. Yeah, go for it, Hubie. But, hey, once we're on deck, it's every man for himself. Yes, sir! Okay, Hubie. Here's how you're gonna break out of that cage. Now, I want you to pay attention. Watch my beak. [BELL RINGING] Have you got everything? This is all I need. [MAN SINGING] Here come the boots. Okay, kid. This is it. Get ready. Ahoy, mateys. Get your gullets ready for the sloppiest slop that ever graced a galley's garbage. You don't know how lucky you are, matey. [LAUGHS] [HUMMING] Now, I don't want no trouble from you today. Well, now. That's more like it. [LAUGHING] Come back here, you... Come back. What's going on down there... ROCKO: Come on, Hubie. Let's go! There's two of them out now. Let me go! Come on. Take your best shot. I'm out of here. Forget the blasted pebble! [WHOOPING] [ALL CHEERING] Charlie! He's heading for the side. Come on! Let's go! So long, Hubie. I'm out of here. Please don't leave me. Wait till I get my hands on you. ROCKO: You can stop following me now. You're on your own now. Come on. [BOTH GROANING] Hey. Where are we? Let's see. Judging by the heat, I'd say I'd died and went to Phoenix. Rocko, look. People. Looks like some private beach. We must be in Moorea or Tahiti. How do they live like this? They pay for it. I wonder how far it is to Antarctica. Three thousand miles in that direction, but you'll never make it. I will so. I'm fit. Hey, trust me on this one. You've got "Eat me" written all over you. I'm a good swimmer. You don't know these waters like I do, birdbrain. You're right. I'm lost. Yep. You're lost. And I'm looking at a dead penguin. Yeah, I give it two days, tops, and you'll be in the belly of anything from a killer whale to a sardine. Getting back to Marina is all that matters to me. I mean, Rocko, look. I dream about her night and day. I see her face when I close my eyes. And this. Just look at this. Wow. Is that an engagement pebble, or what? Do you have to gush like that? You're probably asking yourself where I got it, right? Yes.Picture this. Pebble beach, moonlit sky, gentle breeze. Come on. Come on. Get to it. Suddenly, I look up and there it is. The first evening star. Summarize. Summarize. What do I do? I make a wish. And, like magic, it jets across the sky in a blaze of glory and comes to rest at my feet. Really? I pick it up, and there, shining deep inside, is... There is the face of my own true love, Marina. Oh, so special. So unique. So what! Don't you see? It's my fate, Rocko. I'm destined to marry Marina. It's in the stars. "I'm destined to marry Marina. It's in the stars." Why don't you get that thing fixed? Oh, I'm sorry. I--I guess nobody likes a blabbermouth, right? No. You think? There. I'm free of you at last. Now go away. Shoo. Adios. Boy. You're really one grumpy guy in the morning, aren't you? No. I'm grumpy all day. What happened? Did your girl run off with another penguin? No. She did not. Oh, then she's waiting for you, right? Look, will you stop following me? You know what you need? You need a dream. I got one.What is it? I'm sure not gonna tell you. Your secret's safe with me. I don't even know you. I won't laugh. Forget it!It doesn't matter how silly it sounds. Get away!I promise. Cross my heart. I won't laugh. All right. All right. All right.What? I got something. What is it? You're looking at it. I'm looking at... [STUTTERING] You want to fly, do you? Don't laugh. Rocko, everybody knows penguins can't f-fly. You're wrong! You are dead wrong. [CHUCKLING]Our ancestors flew. They gave us wings, but we can't fly? I mean... I mean, whose idea of a cruel joke is this? I mean... I mean, you've got to just accept it. No. No. I don't accept nothing. But, Rocko, that's the way things are. I want to fly. I'm gonna fly, and no one's gonna stop me. I'm flying. Flap them. Flap them. Flap them. [SCREAMING] [WHOOPING] Don't laugh. Nobody laughs at Rocko the Rockhopper. That's funny. You see, I expected you to tell me something big, really stupendous. You know, like hopping up the slopes of Mt. Everest or something, you know. But flying? Oh, for heaven's sakes. That's so easy. Says who? Waldo, that's who.Waldo? Yeah. He's-- He's...Who's Waldo? Waldo is a short little penguin back in my rookery. Yeah? Really? Yes, really. And listen, he claims to have gotten the hang of flying. And his wings are a lot stubbier than yours. Hey, hey, hey. These aren't stubs. Oh, but... There I go being a big blabbermouth again. Wait. Wait. Come back here. Thank you for helping me escape, Rocko. I've got to go, though. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. I must be back before the next full moon. Marina needs me. Goodbye. Wait, wait. You're lost. That way's north. Oh. I--I just... I just remembered something. I think Waldo said the secret to flying was wind speed. Well, anyway.Wind speed. Off I go.You know, that's right. That's exactly what I think. That's what I've been working on. That's my theory. Wind speed, see? You know, that's amazing, that there's... Someone else knows about that. Well, come here. What else did Waldo say? Can we swim as we talk? Marina's waiting. Yeah, sure. Why not? I got a couple of days, anyway. Which way is south? Uh, that way. I want to meet this Waldo character. Waldo? You get me and Waldo together, and I'll get you to the Antarctic by the next full moon. Oh, I like the sound of that. DRAKE: Well, there's only eight days left before the full moon mating ceremony, and Marina still won't agree to be my mate. Although, my faithful servants, we have seen that Hubie is a leopard seal meal. It's a pleasant thought that that stupid little p-p-penguin nerd will never return. [LAUGHING] Silence, you idiots! Marina is mine. [HORN BLOWING] So, what happens if you don't make it on time? Oh, that's too horrible to even think about. Well, think about it. Who would Marina marry? Drake!Drake? Why, is he any good with the ladies?Yeah. Well, Captain, full speed ahead. Here we go. We only have five days left, Rocko. We're running out of time. Look. We can't swim in this storm, unless you want to die. Maybe Drake will leave Marina alone. Yeah, well, maybe Drake has already married Marina. No. No. I know my girl. She'll wait. And if she accepts this pebble, we'll be married. If she accepts the pebble? You mean, you're not sure if she's gonna accept the pebble? [LAUGHS] You mean, you're going through all this trouble and you're not even sure? She'll accept it. Oh, come on. It's beautiful. It's... It's perfect. Yes, it is perfect, isn't it, Rocko? There, that ledge.Rocko. We have discovered an authentic ancient "aviarial" airstrip. What? This is beautiful. This is it. [STUTTERING] You're not gonna try to fly again, are you? Oh, you bet your tail feathers I am. Rocko, penguins can't fly! Feel that wind.Rocko! Where's your sense of adventure? This is the chance of a lifetime. This is the end of a lifetime. Wind speed, perfect. Altitude, perfect. Tail feathers, perfect. Wing, span, wind, sky, airlift! Rocko, don't. You're gonna k-kill yourself. Hubie, watch. I'm flying! I'm flying! Yes. Yes. Oh, wind speed. Wind speed, not enough wind speed. [GROANING] HUBIE: Goodness glaciers. Rocko, are you all right? Rocko! Get away from me.But I just... Don't touch me. Just get away. I was just trying to... I don't need any help. Just get away from me now. Fine. S-Suit yourself. I will. Just keep going. Go back to little green eyes or whatever her name is. [STUTTERING] Well, maybe I will. Yeah, go. See how long you last on your own. Hubie. No! No. I mean, no, wait. So you decided to apologize, huh? Well, then, I... Don't be stupid. I don't apologize to anybody. Look. [WHALE SCREECHING] That, pebblebrain, is a killer whale. The meanest killing machine in these waters. Goodness glaciers! You saved my life. No. Come on. Don't get all whiny about it. Just go. Go, go play with your pebble. It's no big deal. Just go. Go. Leave me alone. No, I'm serious. I could've been killed. I'm starting to wish you had. Just go, will you? Can't you even admit that you like me just a little? What? I don't like you. I hate you. I just happen to hate killer whales a little bit more than you, that's all. Is that so? Yeah.Well, then, fine. Fine is right. When the whale leaves, we'll just go our separate ways, then. Yeah. Well, sounds good to me. I don't need to be seen with... [SCREAMING] Fire in the sky! Fire in the sky! Fire in the sky! Hide, hide, hide, hide! That's it. Hey, what is that? Who's that? What are you doing? Who... Get your own shelter. I was here first. So, I'm here second. So what? Move! DRAKE: So, Marina. When should I announce our engagement? Today? Tomorrow? Wednesday? Drake, I wouldn't marry you if you were the last penguin on Earth. Don't worry. I'll make it official with the obligatory pebble and all that. The answer is no. No? No? Oh, I get it. You're joking.

It's all right if--if you wanna split up. I understand. No hard feelings. Well, it's probably for the best. Hey, give my regards to Waldo. Waldo? Waldo. Oh, yeah. I sure will. I... Rocko, there's something you should know. Waldo... Waldo isn't real. What? I needed you to show me the way home. I--I didn't think you'd do it if I just asked, so I... So I made up stories about a make-believe guy named Waldo. Well, say something. You told me a lie? You dumb penguin nerd. Rocko, stop! I could've been back in Tahiti with those people on the beach...I'm sorry. ...feeding me because I was a cute little penguin. I said I'm sorry. No, you. You decided to lie to me.Oh. Come on. To drag me through 3,000 miles of water and killer whales. You're a dead penguin. You are a... Clear! Clear that beak! Clear! [CHOKING] [LAUGHING] [BOTH LAUGHING] You're either the greatest romantic hero of all time, or you're the stupidest penguin who ever lived. HUBIE: I'm sorry I lied to you, Rocko. Who likes a liar? Not me. I really needed your help. Look. If--If you're ever down near the South Pole, please look me up. [CHUCKLING] In four days, birdbrain, I'll be in Antarctica. Where will you be, huh?

Why, I'm tougher than any polar bear. Why, I'm hungry. What do we have here? Looks like a seal's fishing hole. [STUTTERING] Do you think it's safe? I'm too hungry to care if it's safe or not. Let's go. How much farther to the Antarctic? I don't know. It could be a few miles. It could be a few days. Who cares? Come on. A few days. [STUTTERING] I don't think I could wait that long.

FEMALE NARRATOR: As they continued their journey home, Rocko was determined to teach Hubie that it wasn't enough simply being in love with Marina. The time would come when he would have to fight for her. But with Drake as his opponent, would he be up to the challenge? [WHOOPING] I won. I won. I won. I won. I won. I won. I won. I won. I beat you by a mile. You're blind as a bat. I was winning, man. I won the whole way. I was way in front of you. Rocko!I left you in the cold. Come on. [THUDDING] Goodness glaciers! What was that? Looked like a killer whale. [STUTTERING] It was bigger than a leopard seal. Twice as big, twice as fast and twice as mean. Oh, good. But that's not the worst part. Wonderful. What's the worst part? Killer whales always travel in groups. What?Groups. Oh, no.Big groups. Lots. Oodles and oodles. What do we do now? We... We... You see that iceberg?What iceberg? That one! Swim for it.
