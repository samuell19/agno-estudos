[instrumental music] [indistinct chatter] You see the animals they have here? 'Cause I saw people freak out. Like the, the giant eight-foot flies that we have. 'And then you try to act like they're harmless.' '"Oh, they won't bite you."' 'Anything eight-foot long has a chance of eating you up.' And you think it's like a bear. 'Cause you're coming back from the disco you've been drinking little bit, and you hear, grr! [audience laughing] Trees movin', and the GO. "Oh, don't worry, that's just a fly." 'I saw a fly take a lady's--' O'Shea, how come we keep laughing at the same jokes? We must have heard him 20 times. [O'Shea] That's why I hired him. [audience laughing] Come on, Conrad, keep up with me, man. - 'Hey, he's there!' - His lady's in Tahiti. He done lost his mind. 'See, love will do that to you.' 'You fall in love, you go stupid.' So remember that, don't fall in love. Just mess around a lot, then your mind will stay intact. 'Hey, y'all been a beautiful audience.' Thank you for coming out this evenin'. Thank you for comin' down here to Club Med. We had a good time with you. We want you to party with us. Come on down to the disco.

Oh, Gilbert Antony Paige from Yorkshire, England. [Carl] 'Yo, it's a pleasure, Gil.' Uncle Gilbert, pay attention. The line is moving. I-I beg your pardon? You know, I don't think we brought enough lotion for your skin. They say the sun here is the devil. What are you babbling about, young lady? Well, I'm afraid my uncle is having one of his turns. You know, it's the sun and his age. Forgets where he is, who he is. Uncle Gilbert, it's me, Simone. Please will you let go of my chin. Please. Tell them you are my uncle. I don't even know your name. Look, I'm not getting involved in any little deception for some girl that I've never laid eyes on. Okay. It's alright. I'm tired of living anyway. What did you say? In every other aspect Jean Michel is a very good husband to me. Your husband? It's only when he drinks that he hits me so. - Your husband hits you? - Hmm. And his hands, they are so big and so strong. I've black and blue marks all over my body. - Look, I show you. - Oh, no, no, no. That's quite alright. I'll take your word for it. - What's your name? - Simone. - Simone LaFontanne. - Well, Simone. Haven't you been to the police about all this? Well, yes. Well, what did they do? Well, what can they do? Jean Michel is the chief of the police. Oh, Uncle Gilbert, there's nothing I can do. Miss LaFontanne, I see you're only 17. You have to be accompanied by an adult. Uh, she's with me. She's my niece. On my daughter's side. Thanks, Uncle Gilbert. Mind you, I'm only doing this as a favor. I'm not taking any responsibility for you. I know. Thanks. I want a suite. Hey, my man. Where's all the action around this place anyway? Hey, killer, why don't you pace yourself? You gonna be here for a whole week, my man. Hey, how you guys doing? Welcome to "Club Med." Let me take you to your room. [Gypsy] 'I put you in bungalow 167, you go down there' I'll have a GO bring your bags a little later. Alright?' Enjoy yourself. How's everything going, Gypsy? Oh, it's the biggest crowd of the season so far. That's good. Make sure everybody gets a drink. Okay? You got it. [Gypsy] Alright, I'm going to put you in bungalow 143. 'Take these two tags' 'and a GO will bring your bags down later.' Look, Danny, first thing you have to do is to get rid of.. Why don't you, uh, shed some of those clothes? We wear very little down here. So how was your trip? Does it matter? You like music? [instrumental music] Yeah, it's too bad I didn't bring any down with me. Look, Danny.. ...I'm really sorry about your father. You know he was a good friend of mine. 'Yeah, I remember.' My mother said to make sure that you got this. What is it? Brief history of all my transgressions. Uh-huh. Against her or the state of Alaska? You name it. [music continues] Look, this is between you and the juvenile courts. The only thing I care about 'is the kind of work you do for me.' - So what can you do? - I can do anything. Ski, climb, run a kayak. I can fly a bush plane. And women are crazy about me. [chuckles] Yeah, well, I hate to tell you we don't have any snow we don't have any rapids, and, uh, as far as the women go.. '...let's put that on hold for right now.' You're gonna have your hands plenty full learning to be a GO. A what? GO, that's what all Club Med staffers are called. That's real radical. Real radical. Look, Kate, listen to me. Kate. Come on, would I do something like that to you? I swear. 'Last I heard, O'Shea was in Juneau, Alaska.' Well, then what is this? Coincidence? [Al] 'It does happen. That's why there's a word for it.' [sighs] So what are you gonna do? I don't know. I can't avoid him for a whole week. You know, maybe you shouldn't avoid him at all. Al, do me a favor. Don't give me any more advice, please. Hi, guy. How you doing? - Oh. - This is my bed here, huh? I had no idea we were sharing. Uh, I'm Gilbert Paige from Yorkshire, England. Yeah, right, uh, Bart Chambers, Motown. What do we got here? That's a mosquito net. Thank you. [chuckles] Alright, uh, here's the plan. One of us gets a lady in the room they takes a towel, they put it around the doorknob. You got it? I beg your pardon? I'll explain later. Aren't you going to go to the welcoming party? No. Won't you get hungry? Mm, I don't know. I'll worry about that later. Is there something wrong? - How old are you? - Eighteen. I'm 27. At 27, you can understand 18. At 18, you can't understand 27. Oh. I'm sorry. Look, chances are I'm not gonna be the cheeriest roommate in camp but don't let that ruin your vacation. Okay. Listen, you know, if you want, I can bring you something back. It is no problem. That would be nice. Thank you. Okay. Ciao. Ciao. Hello. Welcome to Ixtapa. Welcome to Club Med paradise.

You'll either fall in love with our sun our ocean, our beaches or some of you will fall in love with one another 'cause it has happened before at some of our Club Med's. We don't want you to feel any pressure because here time is on your side. Because there is no such thing as time 'just having fun.' 'And if you have anything, any problems' 'anything that you wanna do' 'just talk to one of the GO staff.' ''Cause we want you to do everything' 'and anything you've ever wanted to do.' 'So on behalf of the Club Med staff' 'I'd like to say welcome to paradise.' [applauding] [indistinct chatter] Alright. That's five beads. Beads. What are we, pilgrims now?

I cannot go back or my grandmother she'll make me go to a convent. So it's a convent now, is it? - Yes. - Is that really the truth? I swear. Cross my heart. 'Then the least you can do is call your grandmother' 'and tell her where you are.' She must be worried sick about you. Look, if you were my grandchild I'd be frantically worried. And if you, Uncle Gilbert, were my grandfather I would see to it you enjoy life much more. I mean, it is so sad. Everyone here, they have so much fun. I know. I never realized that seeing people having fun could make me so miserable. I miss Mattie so much. Who's Mattie? My late wife. Oh, I did not know, Uncle Gilbert. I'm sorry. How long is it? Just under two years. Two years. Well.. - Okay, move. - What're you doing? Isn't it time you start having some fun? I mean, two years, no fun. It's an awfully long time. [instrumental music] Bonjour.

Now it has, what're you gonna do? 'Wait till the next time you just happen to bump into him?' I don't know. I-I'm scared. 'Kate, you've got to do it.'

I'd love to know what kind of disease you get that the doctor prescribes windsurfing. So I'm stuck in here all day now.. ...watching these couples come and go fixing these fruity drinks with the little umbrellas in 'em. There you go. My brother's a doctor. I put umbrellas in people's drinks.. ...and watch them fall in love. 'Anybody ever think that I might wanna fall in love' 'once in a while, huh?' [engine rumbling] You wanna take a turn at the wheel? You've done this before. Frank teach you? 'Yeah.' Must've been pretty incredible having Frank for a dad. I used to think so. Mad at him? [rumbling continues] You know, when I first heard about the accident I thought to myself "What the hell was he doing in a bush plane in a storm like that?" O'Shea, you don't know what you're talking about now. 'You sit here on your pretty white beach' drinking your lunch out of a coconut every day. You have no idea how many times my father went into the bush when he didn't have to. So, yeah, he was a great guy but in the end he was just another loser. Right, Danny. He flew food and supplies into places nobody else would go and lost his life doing it. That makes him a real zero. And while he was busy saving the world he left me with a hell of a mess. What mess is that? [mellow music] He's not even cold yet.. ...and my mother is living with this Eugene guy. I don't even know how she can stand to be around him.. ...but I think that she's just never sober enough to realize what a jerk he is. So if my old man was so great, why did he marry her? I think your father married your mother, Danny.. ...because he thought he could save her. He was always a sucker for being a hero. That is what he said about you. You know, if you really got into it you could make this place work for you. Yeah, I could maybe. All it takes is a little caring. Caring is what got my father, so forget it. So you're just gonna give it up and throw your life away, right? It's my life. It may be, but it's currently in my hands. 'A week.' Shape up or pack.

Whatever we had whatever happened between us I never thought I could hate you. O'Shea, when I found out I was pregnant I didn't even know where you were. - How hard did you look? - Very hard. When you wanna get lost, there's no finding you. Look, I had a choice to make. Maybe you would have married me, maybe not. But I, at the time I didn't wanna wake up one morning and find you off on another one of your adventures. I have a six-year-old son. You don't think that I wanna be there? You think I don't wanna be there to see him when he grows up? That's my choice. You made yours and to hell with what I wanted. You never said you wanted a child. Neither did you. O'Shea, you know you have an orientation meeting? 'There are a lot of people waiting for you.' We're not finished. [instrumental music] [indistinct chatter] [O'Shea] Hey, Danny. Danny, do you have something to do? Yeah. I'm supposed to take the fishing boat out. Well, get down there. You think they're gonna wait all day? He's got time. She wasn't even the worst of it 'cause last week was my mother's birthday, you know? And I forgot all about it. So, I called her, and I tried to tell her it was 'cause of the time difference that really for me, her birthday was this week. 'But you know, she's not stupid, so I'm in the doghouse.' On top of which my brother, Mr. Civilization 'gives her this incredible gift' 'not 'cause he loves her so much' 'just to make me look bad.' [O'Shea] 'I've been getting complaints about you.' - Complaints? - 'You're the bartender.' People are supposed to tell you their troubles not the other way around. - But-- - But nothing. [music continues] - What's the matter? What? - I'll tell you, buddy. It's my boss. He just doesn't understand me. [instrumental music] Whoops. Hey, cleanup, you missed somethin'. Pretty boy, I'll stick your head in there-- You don't wanna mess with me, cleanup. I'm a bit out of your league. Danny! Oh! - We'll clean this up later. - Later. Okay? Watch your step as you're gettin' on the boat. How you doin' now? How you doin'? Watch your step. Got a little room here. How you doin' today? People, if you look off to your right you can see we have the very scenic Pelican Island which is one of the most beautiful things in this region.' Danny, come on. I'm trying to keep O'Shea from gettin' on your case. - Yeah, yeah. - Now what's up? My mother. She's getting married again. Oh, man, that's great. Congratulations! Yeah, it's great. Alright. [music continues] Well, people, as you see there's a lot of water sports to enjoy out here. You got parasailing, windsurfing, swimming. [indistinct chatter] So you found out you were pregnant then you went sneakin' off to Boston. There was no sneaking involved. I decided to move. What about this Charlie guy? Huh? You probably met him in the first half-hour. He was an accountant. I had a small trust fund from my father. I decided to invest it in the baby's education, and-- And what? And he took care of it for me. Did he know about the baby? Of course. Allison? Did she know about the baby? Yes. Everybody knew about the baby.. ...except me. That's perfect. [instrumental music] [sighs] I didn't have to have Phillip but I did. I loved you. Then why did you marry him? Because I was frightened.. ...'cause I didn't want to have a child all by myself and I knew Charlie was someone I could count on. I had no right to keep it from you. But at the time, I did the best I could. I'm sorry. [Rick] So we go into town to eat sushi, you know. You ever have sushi? It's good if you like bait. They all said, "You'll love it. It's great if you like fish." No, it's great if you area fish. I said to the waiter, I said, "This isn't food to eat." I said, "This is food to get other food with. "Did you ever hear of the life chain? "You put it on a hook, catch a fish "feed that to some livestock and make me a bacon sandwich." Oh, but youmay like it. Bon appetit. ["Eine Kleine Nachtmusik" instrumental] [music continues] [waves crashing] [music continues] [music continues] [waves crashing] [keys jingling] [glass bottles rattling] [music continues] [engine starting] [tires screeching] [engine revving] [O'Shea] It's a little cold. - How's that? Better? - Yeah. Good. Whoo! Well.. ...what kind of kid is he? - The best. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Is he good in sports? - He's great at dodge ball. - Yeah! [both laughing] What about girls? Does he like girls? O'Shea, he's six years old. Give him a chance. So that's okay. I liked girls when I was six. - I bet you did. - I did. He's got to be smart.. ...like me. He's brilliant, like me. [both laughing] [music continues] [sighs] He's the best thing that ever happened to me. What does he look like? He looks like you. [music continues] Ah, the hell with you, dad! [sirens wailing] [rock music on stereo] [siren wailing] [clattering] [speaking in foreign language] Driving while intoxicated, reckless driving speeding, driving without a license, stolen car! I got an empty cell, O'Shea. What's it gonna be? Your place or mine? I'll take care of him this time. Thanks for the ride, Gypsy. Yeah, no problem, boss. Muchas gracias, Capitan Rios. Adios. [telephone ringing] [engine starting] [engine revving] Don't you have anything to say? Look, Danny, I know you've got problems. I've got problems, but I've got guests. Look, when you get it more together you come back and see me, okay? Because right now, you're on the next boat out of here. I'm sorry. Let me get this straight, man. Drunk drivin', no driver's license anda stolen vehicle? What's wrong? Couldn't you find a liquor store to rob along the way or something? 'What's the deal with you, Danny?' It was just a night on the town. I can't deal with O'Shea. Man, it can't be that bad. I'll tell you what we'll do. 'You sleep on it tonight, and tomorrow I'll go with you' 'in the morning. We'll talk to the man.' There's no talking to him. Okay, so what you gonna do now? I can do anything. I can walk out the door tomorrow. - 'And where you're gonna go?' - Go anywhere. [Sinbad] 'And how are you gonna get there?' [chuckles] That's not important. See, man, you're not even thinkin' straight. And what about Simone? I thought you cared about the lady. You tell her goodbye for me. Goodbye? [instrumental music] Rough night with Danny? [sighs] Yeah. Well, don't forget about our schedule-- [O'Shea] You know, Jody, sometimes I wonder.. ...maybe we shouldn't be running this place. Maybe you should go back to England and I should go back to my horses. O'Shea, neither of us are any good at having roots. That's why we're here, remember? People change. I happen to like it here. I thought you did, too? Lately, Jody, I'm not even sure why I'm here. I mean, am I really doing the world any good by being here? Or am I just hiding? [Jody] 'It's the first time in your life' 'you've ever stuck with anything.' - That counts for something. - I don't know. - What do you mean? - I mean, I don't know. Right now, I'm gonna pick up my life where it left off seven years ago. [instrumental music] You know, that old farmhouse of mine needs a coat of paint. 'And I think that Phillip would love horses.' [Kate] 'Are you serious?' I don't know. What would you say if I were? I don't know. - Pass-- - Give-give it to me! - This way. - Watch out, watch out! - No, no, no, wait. - 'Over here. Over here.' Come on! Throw. - This way. - Oh.. [speaking in foreign language] - Okay, okay. - There, there you go. [whistle blows] Foul! Charging. What do you mean, charging? Charging! I've never charged anything in my life but clothes. If you don't like it, get another referee. Good. Fine, we will. Get O'Shea. Forget O'Shea. The man's in love. Jody, Jody, come here, please. - 'Can't it wait?' - No, it can't. Please. - What? - Look, a telex came in. I really think you should see it. It's important. I'm sorry, girls. Maybe you can find another opponent. Sure. I know just who we'll get. Uncle Gilbert, come over here. [Gilbert] 'Alright, then, give me the ball.' Here's what we're gonna do, girls. - 'What?' - How do you play this game? [Jody] What is so bloody important? Did you have to ruin my only time off? Our little friend, Simone she's a 17-year-old runaway. Where's O'Shea? What are wegoing to do? [instrumental music] Well, come on. You are going to do what? How can you betray me like this? I have to notify your grandmother 'that you're here and you're safe.' I thought.. I thought that you were my friend! - I am. - You are not. Now stop arguing, I'm sure that O'Shea can straighten things out. We'll find him. Simone, I'm-- Get off of me! Listen, I'm doing what I think is best. What you are doing is ruining my life forever. Uncle Gilbert, do something! Now, I'll talk to you later. [Jody] 'What choice do I have?' [Gilbert] 'Uh, uh, you start pondering' and I'll have a chat with Simone. Hey, what are you doing here? I came to say goodbye. O'Shea gave me my walking papers today. Why? But where are you going to go? I don't know. All he said was that I had to leave. Well, that's it then. I'm going with you. What? They found out I'm only 17 so they called my grandmother. Now she's coming. I can't stay here, either. I'm going with you. - You sure? - Yes, I'm sure. I think it's a good plan. Don't you? Yes, I think it's a good plan. Okay, that's it. Ten minutes, I change, we go. - You make it five. - You pack my bags. Hey, do we need all this makeup stuff? [Simone] 'Well, of course.' 'Okay, Danny, come on, tell me what you think.' Do you like it? Now, that is perfect for a runaway. I thought so. - Hi. - I thought we were in a hurry. Then kiss me quick. [knock on door] [knock on door] Hi, I just dropped by to see if you'd be interested in, uh.. - Well, I.. - Cleanup. Oh, man, I would have thought you'd have been moppin' floors or somethin' by now. Pretty boy, I am really sick of you. [Simone] 'Danny, Stop it! Stop, Danny.' Stop it! Stop it! 'Oh..' Alright, alright. We don't wanna get hurt. Just cool it. - You can have her, man-- - Come on! - Just cool it, man. - Come on! - I'm coming. - Come on! [bottle shattering] [instrumental music] [speaking in foreign language] [O'Shea] You should go home, get Phillip and bring him back. - No, O'Shea. - Why not? Look, I could teach him how to snorkel. He can learn how to water-ski. He could become a junior GO. That's funny. You know, that's not such a bad idea. Whatever happened to the farmhouse? Nothing. We can go there for Christmas. - You like it? - Mm.. It's you. I like it. [speaking in foreign language] Muchas gracias. Okay, I've got everything. What makes you think we can make it work this time? We didn't have any luck last time. Kate, we were too young last time. O'Shea, you haven't changed. That's why you're here. Kate! This place is perfect for you you get to move around, it's exotic. You can't tell me you don't love it. Well, maybe we should have waited for O'Shea before we went yelling for her grandma. Oh, well, it's too late now. Jody, quick, we got to do something. She's gone. Simone's gone. - Gone where? - I don't know. - Her room's empty. - Are you sure? Where Simone's clothes go, Simone goes. Now, look. She's all alone. I'm afraid it's my fault. Look, don't worry, we'll find her. Come to the office. I guarantee you, she's not alone. Okay, so I love it here. That doesn't mean I couldn't love it someplace else. Yeah, but how long would you love someplace else before moving on? I don't know. Maybe I haven't had the right situation. Are you serious or are you just listening to yourself talk? Try me. Alright, O'Shea, move to Boston. We'll give it a shot. You mean it? I mean it. [music continues] - Boston, huh? - Yeah. [chuckling] [tires screeching] [engine revving] - Use the brakes. There you go. - Alright. [Kate chuckles] Nothing to it. Yeah, good experience. Take this one to the house. Take this one to the kitchen. Uh-oh, welcoming committee. I'll see you later, okay? Que paso? Danny and Simone are missing. Since when? In addition to which Simone happens to be a 17-year-old runaway. Gilbert isn't her uncle. I just thought you might like to know what's been going on around here while you've been gone. I was in town getting supplies. Oh, that's not what I meant, O'Shea. You're not even here anymore when you're here. - What are you two lookin' at? - Nothin'. Get inside, get on the phones and find 'em. Okay. Right now, we're goin', we're goin'. Okay, so my mind hasn't been on my job. This hasn't exactly been a normal week for me. I know that. Well, then what are you so angry about? Because I remember when this used to be more than a job to you. You used to say we were like your family. So, if you're going to turn your back on us all in a moment's notice, you could, at least make it look a little harder. You're gonna help me find them? We have no choice. Call the police. [Jody] 'What do you want me to tell them?' Tell them we have two runaways. Runaways? Isn't that a little harsh? Okay, there's your gin and tonic, and relax. They're gonna be fine. I mean, what could happen to them here in a strange country where they don't know the language or the customs or the terrain? Gee, I hope they stick to the main roads. I knew a guy who wandered off into the jungle here and almost got eaten by a monitor lizard. Luckily, a group of marauding bandidos came by and robbed him first. But-- Isn't it about time you put a cork in it, young man? Could I freshen that for you? [speaking in foreign language] [pigeons cooing] [speaking in foreign language] [instrumental music] [Simone] Where are we going, Danny? Out of here. Ah, it's times like this I miss Pierre. - Who is Pierre? - He's my driver. [music continues] Come on. Hey, hey! Come on. [engine rumbling] Excuse me. [speaking in foreign language] - I don't understand him. - Where? Where? [speaking in foreign language] Pesos? I've got some beads. You want some beads? No, no, no, no beads. What about French francs? You want some French francs? No, no, no French francs. - Come on, senor. -How about American dollars? Ah, now you are talking. - Twenty. - Twenty? Twenty. Okay. - Okay? - Okay. Come on. [engine revving] [donkeys braying] [engine rumbling] [Simone] So what are we going to do now? I don't know. We don't have a lot of money. Yes, but we have enough to get to Mexico City then we figure out from there. Hey, let's go to Rio. I love Rio. Come on. Let's just concentrate on Mexico City first.
