* - IN INDIA, PEOPLE HAVE HEARD OF TEA TASTING, ESPECIALLY IN THE NORTH, BUT IN THE SOUTH, STILL TEA TASTING WAS NOT ALL THAT FAMILIAR, AND COFFEE TASTING WAS, OF COURSE, TOTALLY UNHEARD OF. SO WHEN I USED TO TELL PEOPLE THAT I HAD A VERY FASCINATING JOB OF BEING A TASTER, MY INSTANT REACTION WOULD BE, "WHAT? YOU MEAN YOU'RE JUST CUPPING CUPS AND THEN YOU'RE SPITTING OUT AND THEN GETTING PAID FOR IT? YOU MEAN YOU HAVE A COFFEE BREAK ALL THE TIME? WHAT A FASCINATING JOB. I'D LOVE TO HAVE A JOB LIKE THAT." - I'VE DONE THIS FOR 22 YEARS. EVERY TIME I MAKE COFFEE -- AND I'M ON THE BAR A LOT, YOU KNOW. I'M STILL A BARISTA, AND I'M ABOUT TO BE THE WORLD'S OLDEST BARISTA. I'M JUST TELLING YOU. THAT'S MY GOAL. BUT EVERY TIME I MAKE COFFEE, I FEEL AT PEACE. - THE MOST FASCINATING THING IS THAT IT'S SOMETHING THAT SO MANY CULTURES SHARE, AND WE ALL LIKE TO PREPARE AND DRINK COFFEE, YOU KNOW, THE WAY THAT WE ALL LIKE TO, BUT IT'S SOMETHING THAT, YOU KNOW, WHEN THE SUN COMES UP IN THE MORNING, NO MATTER WHERE YOU ARE IN THE WORLD, SOMEBODY'S ENJOYING A CUP. - THE SMELL OF COFFEE FOR, I GUESS, FOR EVERY ITALIAN, IS THE MORNING, BECAUSE AS SOON AS YOU WAKE UP, THE SMELL OF THIS NICE COFFEE THAT YOU CAN DRINK AS SOON AS YOU GET TO THE TABLE WITH YOUR PARENTS, WITH YOUR SISTER, BROTHER, DOGS -- WHATEVER YOU HAVE AT HOME. - IT'S A GOOD WAY TO WAKE UP IN THE MORNING FOR ME, AND SINCE I DRINK A VERY SPECIAL BRAND OF COFFEE, THAT IN ITSELF GIVES ME AN OPPORTUNITY TO START MY DAY OFF IN THE RIGHT WAY. - THERE'S ALWAYS, LIKE, THIS ONE MOMENT RIGHT BEFORE I DRINK MY FIRST COFFEE THAT'S LIKE A SACRED MOMENT, WHERE I'M GRATEFUL THAT I HAVE IT AND I KNOW THAT EVERYTHING'S GONNA GET BETTER AFTER THAT. - EVEN FROM THE TIME I WAS A KID, A LOT OF MY RELATIVES WORKED AT FOLGERS, YOU KNOW, SO COFFEE WAS THIS SMELL, THIS AROMA THAT WAS JUST INTOXICATING. - I CAN'T GO A DAY WITHOUT COFFEE. MY MIND DOES NOT WORK WITHOUT COFFEE. I COULD USE A COFFEE RIGHT NOW. - WHEN YOU'RE DRINKING AND YOU STILL GET A BREATH OF AIR AFTER THAT? YOU'RE AN ADDICT. - WHEN YOU'RE WORKING BEHIND A COFFEE BAR AND YOU'RE HANDING CUPS OF COFFEE TO PEOPLE, YOU KNOW, AND THEY REALLY WANT IT, YOU'RE LIKE, "WOW, I'M KIND OF A PEDDLER." - IT'S A DRUG. I MEAN, IT'S -- YOU KNOW, IT'S ONE OF THE FEW DRUGS I DO. I LIKE IT. - MY MOTHER DRANK COFFEE, MY FATHER DRANK COFFEE, MY BROTHERS, MY SISTERS DRANK COFFEE. - YOU KNOW, COFFEE DOESN'T JUST HAVE TO BE THIS MORNING ADDICTION FIX. IT CAN BE SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE TURN INTO A RITUAL THAT IS CULINARY AND VERY PERSONAL AND GUIDED BY QUALITY. - THE THING ABOUT COFFEE IS THAT EVERY STEP REQUIRES THIS AMAZING FOCUS AND ATTENTION TO DETAIL. IT'S TAKEN FOR GRANTED BY MOST PEOPLE, AND THAT'S THE THING THAT APPEALS TO ME MOST ABOUT COFFEE, BECAUSE IT'S THIS INCREDIBLE, EXOTIC THING WITH THIS INCREDIBLE BACK STORY GOING BACK TO ETHIOPIA AND TOUCHES INDONESIA, LATIN AMERICA, COLONIALISM, AND MODERN AGRICULTURAL EXCHANGE SITTING THERE ON THEIR BREAKFAST TABLE EVERY MORNING. - IN THE ETHIOPIAN COFFEE CEREMONY, A WOMAN -- IT'S ALWAYS A WOMAN AND IT'S ALWAYS AT THE HEAD OF THE HOUSEHOLD OR A SIGNIFICANT PLACE IN THE COMMUNITY -- PREPARES THE COFFEE. SHE ROASTS IT, SHE GRINDS IT, SHE BREWS IT. IN THE CONTEXT OF THIS CEREMONY THAT IS FOR HER FAMILY AND HER FRIENDS. THE TRADITION IS FOR PEOPLE TO INTERACT, TO TALK ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE VILLAGE OR IN THE HOUSEHOLD. AND WHEREVER COFFEE HAS GONE FROM ETHIOPIA TO YEMEN, FROM YEMEN THROUGHOUT ARABIA, AND FROM THERE TO EUROPE AND FROM EUROPE ALL OVER THE WORLD, THIS TRADITION OF COFFEE PREPARATION, THAT IDEA OF SOCIAL INTERACTION HAS ALWAYS GONE WITH IT. SO IN ETHIOPIA, IT WAS THE VILLAGE AND THE HOUSEHOLD. IN ARABIA, IT WAS THE SOUK, YOU KNOW, THE MARKETPLACE, WHERE PEOPLE WOULD HAVE COFFEE. IN EUROPE, IT WAS THE COFFEEHOUSE IN THE CITY WHERE INTELLECTUALS WOULD GATHER OR OTHER SOCIAL INTERACTION. NOW WHAT THE COFFEEHOUSE HAS BECOME IS THAT SAME THING, ONLY IN THE CONTEXT OF, YOU KNOW, 21st-CENTURY DEVELOPED COUNTRIES. SO WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN THE PAST 10 YEARS AND WE'RE SEEING RIGHT NOW IS THE REDISCOVERY OF COFFEE AS A CULINARY EXPERIENCE. WE LOST TRACK OF IT A LITTLE BIT IN THE '80s AND '90s AS IT TRANSFORMED INTO A FAST-FOOD EXPERIENCE, BUT THE REAL, TRUE COFFEEHOUSES NOW HAVE REDISCOVERED THAT SENSE OF SPECIALNESS AT THE SAME TIME THAT THEY'VE REEMPHASIZED THE SOCIAL EXPERIENCE. - COFFEE, FOR THE MOST PART, IT'S JUST SO HYPERLOCAL. THEY'RE NEIGHBORHOOD COFFEE BARS. THE MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE COMING THERE LIVE THERE. THAT VERY LOCAL MARKET AND AUDIENCE, THAT MAKES ALL OF THESE REGIONS SO IMPRESSIVELY DIFFERENT. I THINK THE CITIES DEFINE THE COFFEE BARS IN LARGE PART MORE THAN THE COFFEE BARS SORT OF DEFINE THEIR NICHE IN THE CITY. - THEY KNOW THE MINUTE THEY STEP IN, THEY'RE IN A PLACE OF HUMAN REFUGE FROM THEIR LIFE. THAT PLACE WHERE CUSTOMERS COME IN KIND OF IN BETWEEN WORK, IN BETWEEN HOME, IN A PLACE WHERE THEY CAN REALLY -- THEY CAN RELAX, THEY CAN BE COMFORTABLE, THEY CAN TREAT THEIR SENSES TO WHATEVER NEED STATE THEY HAVE, WHETHER IT'S A CUP OF COFFEE, WHETHER IT'S A PASTRY OR A CUP OF TEA. - THIS IS COMMUNITY, HONEY. THIS IS LIKE GOING, LIKE I SAID, TO YOUR GRANDMA'S HOUSE. FULL OF LOVE. THE KARMA, THE ATMOSPHERE. I CONNECT PEOPLE TOGETHER. I HAVE PEOPLE MET IN MY SHOP AND THEY GET MARRIED. WHEN I FIRST STARTED PHILZ COFFEE, THE PUBLIC WORKERS, THE FIRE DEPARTMENTS, THEY ARE MY NUMBER-ONE CUSTOMERS. THESE PEOPLE WANT ME TO GO OPEN IN THEIR COMMUNITY, ON THEIR BLOCK. I TELL THEM I CAN'T BE EVERYWHERE. BUT ONE DAY, I'M GONNA MAKE A DEAL WITH THE WATER DEPARTMENT, HAVE IT COME THROUGH THE FAUCET. - WHEN I WAS FOUR YEARS OLD, I WALKED INTO THE FOOD GIANT WITH MY MOTHER OFTENTIMES AND SMELLED THE COFFEE IN THE BIG, RED GRINDER THEY USED TO HAVE WHEN YOU GRIND FOR THE CUSTOMER IN THE STORE. AND I LOVED THE FRAGRANCE SO MUCH, AND WHEN I TRIED IT LATER WHEN I WAS 19 IN THE AIR FORCE, I WAS VERY ANGRY THAT THE BEAUTIFUL COFFEE HAD BEEN DESTROYED DURING BREWING. I SAID, "HOW CAN ANYTHING SMELL SO GOOD AND TASTE SO BAD?" SO, MY MISSION IS TO RESEARCH AND DEVELOP AND PREPARE CAFé ESPRESSO AS A CULINARY ART. AND THE GOAL IS TO MAKE A CUP OF COFFEE THAT TASTES AS GOOD AS THE FRAGRANCE COMING OUT OF THE GRINDER WHEN YOU GRIND FRESH BEANS. THAT'S ONE OF THE MOST SUBLIME THINGS ON THE EARTH. - WE ALL HAVE THIS NOTION IN OUR MIND OF WHAT PERFECT COFFEE IS LIKE. IT'S SWEET, IT'S BROWN, IT'S SATISFYING. YOU KNOW, THERE'S SOMETHING RICH ABOUT IT. BUT PEOPLE DON'T KNOW HOW TO ARTICULATE THAT, AND THROUGH GIVING CUPS OF COFFEE TO PEOPLE AND THEN TALKING ABOUT THEM, PEOPLE CAN GET CLOSER TO DESCRIBING AND UNDERSTANDING WHAT MAKES GREAT COFFEE TASTE GREAT TO THEM. - EVERY TIME SOMEBODY TELLS ME THE BEST OF CUP OF COFFEE THEY EVER HAD, IT'S ALWAYS A STORY ABOUT SET AND SETTING. EVERY TIME SOMEONE SAYS, "OH, GOD. THE BEST COFFEE I EVER HAD, I WAS WITH MY SWEETIE. WE WERE ON THE ADRIATIC. WE WERE FALLING IN LOVE. AND THE WAITER CAME OUT, AND HE WAS SO CUTE, AND HE PUT DOWN THESE CUPS. IT WAS HEAVEN!" THAT'S BECAUSE THEY WERE READY TO BE IN HEAVEN. SO THE FLAVOR -- IT'S VERY SUBJECTIVE. IT'S ALL BOUND UP WITH THE HUMAN BEING AND THE EXPERIENCE THEY'RE HAVING AT THAT MOMENT. - SPECIALTY COFFEE, FOR US, IS THE COFFEE THAT HAS VERY LOW LEVEL OF FATS, HAS A PRONOUNCED AROMAS, HAS SPECIFIC AND QUALITATIVE CHARACTERISTICS THAT WE NEED IN ORDER TO OBTAIN AND TO PRODUCE OUR BLEND. - SO, THE AWARENESS OF SPECIAL COFFEE BEING SPECIAL IS GROWING IN COFFEE-PRODUCING COUNTRIES AT THE SAME TIME THAT IT'S GROWING IN COFFEE-CONSUMING COUNTRIES. THERE'S A NATURAL DESIRE TO RECOGNIZE A COFFEE THAT TASTES VERY GOOD OR WAS PRODUCED IN A UNIQUE WAY OR BY A UNIQUE PERSON. THERE WAS THIS MOMENT THAT I WAS STANDING BEHIND THE BAR OF A COFFEE SHOP, AND WE WERE SERVING COFFEE FROM SUMATRA. AND I REALIZED THAT I DIDN'T KNOW REALLY WHERE SUMATRA WAS. I KNEW IT WAS A PLACE, BUT I DIDN'T KNOW WHERE IT WAS. I KNEW -- YOU KNOW, AND WE USED THE WORD "SUMATRA" LIKE A FLAVOR, YOU KNOW, LIKE VANILLA ICE CREAM OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. "SUMATRA COFFEE" WAS LIKE A FLAVOR WORD, NOT NECESSARILY A PLACE WORD. BUT IT KIND OF DAWNED ON ME THAT IT WAS A PLACE AND THERE WAS A FARM IN THAT PLACE THAT WAS WHERE THIS COFFEE CAME FROM. I MADE IT A LIFE GOAL TO SORT OF SWIM UPSTREAM AND FIND WHERE THAT WAS, AND IT TOOK ME ABOUT 10 YEARS TO VISIT THAT FARM IN SUMATRA WHERE IT CAME FROM. BUT I THINK THAT'S THE MOMENT THAT I BECAME A PROFESSIONAL COFFEE PERSON. ERNA KNUTSEN IS THE WOMAN WHO IS GIVEN CREDIT FOR BOTH KIND OF INVENTING THE SPECIALTY COFFEE IDEA AND INVENTED THE NAME "SPECIALTY COFFEE." SHE WAS A WOMAN WHO WORKED AS A SECRETARY FOR A COFFEE TRADING COMPANY THAT WAS SELLING COFFEE TO FOLGERS AND MJB AND STUFF LIKE THAT IN THE '60s. AND SHE WAS GETTING CALLS FROM SMALL ROASTERS THAT WANTED TO BUY JUST A LITTLE BIT OF COFFEE, AND HER BOSSES DIDN'T REALLY HAVE TIME FOR THOSE GUYS, YOU KNOW? THEY'RE ALL, "THIS IS AN ANNOYANCE. ERNA, WOULD YOU JUST KIND OF DEAL WITH THESE PEOPLE?" SHE STARTED TO SELL THEM COFFEE AND SAW THE POTENTIAL IN THESE SMALL ROASTERS THAT WANTED TO DO BETTER QUALITY COFFEE. YOU KNOW, THESE WERE THE MICRO-ROASTERS OF THE 1960s. - BECAUSE IN THE UNITED STATES AT THAT TIME, IN 1966, THERE WERE VERY, VERY FEW PLACES THAT ACTUALLY HAD QUALITY COFFEE. IT WAS ALMOST ALL THE BIG COMMERCIAL CANNED COFFEES, AND THEY WERE REALLY IN A RACE TO THE BOTTOM. YOU KNOW, WHENEVER YOU SEE SOMEONE ADVERTISING THAT YOU CAN GET MORE CUPS OUT OF THE GROUNDS OR MORE CUPS PER CAN, YOU KNOW THAT IT'S MOVING IN THE WRONG DIRECTION. SO WE REALLY HAD, YOU KNOW, NOWHERE TO GO BUT UP. - HARVEY, WANT ANYTHING SPECIAL FOR YOUR BIRTHDAY? - JUST A DECENT CUP OF COFFEE. - YOU'RE KIDDING. - I'M SERIOUS! HONEY, YOUR COFFEE IS UNDRINKABLE. - I STILL SAY DON'T SERVE YOUR AWFUL COFFEE WITH MY STEAKS. - OH, MRS. OLSON, HE'S ALWAYS CRABBING ABOUT MY COFFEE. I COULD CRY! - THERE WAS THE REALIZATION THAT WE WERE JUST DRINKING VERY INFERIOR COFFEE. IT WASN'T A PLEASANT DRINK. IT WAS A FUEL. IT WENT FROM, YOU KNOW, MOST OF THE COFFEE BEING CONSUMED IN RESTAURANTS AND DINERS AND BY PEOPLE'S KITCHEN SINKS AT HOME TO ACTUALLY SPECIALTY COFFEE, WHERE PEOPLE BOUGHT IT BY THE CUP, SPECIFICALLY FOR THE CUP. - THE REAL EXPLOSION I THINK OR THE REAL REVOLUTION WAS WITH MR. PEET IN 1966, WHEN HE HAD BEEN IN BERKELEY FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS, AND... HE WAS REALLY PRETTY SHOCKED WITH THE QUALITY OF COFFEE, AND IT WAS MORE OR LESS TEPID WATER IN THE LATE POST-WAR PERIOD. THE REVOLUTION I THINK IN '66 WAS ONE OF QUALITY. - I HAD A LARGE CUP OF COFFEE AND HAD A QUART OF MILK AND I WAS ABOUT TO POUR MILK INTO IT, AND ALFRED CAME AROUND THE CORNER AND HE SLAPPED THE COFFEE OUT OF -- THE COFFEE CUP OUT OF MY HAND. IT WENT PERFECT SHOT INTO THE TRASH. HE SAID, "YOU WILL NOT PUT MILK IN MY COFFEE. YOU CAN'T TASTE THE COFFEE THROUGH THE MILK, AND HOW ARE YOU GOING TO LEARN TO BE A GOOD ROASTER WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO TASTE THE COFFEE?" SO FROM THAT DAY ON, I'VE ONLY DRANK BLACK COFFEE. - ONCE YOU'VE REALLY ENJOYED A REALLY FULLY FLAVORED CUP OF COFFEE, REALLY WELL ROASTED, REALLY FRESH, IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT TO TURN BACK. THERE'S NEVER BEEN A GREAT CUP OF COFFEE -- A TRULY TRANSPORTING CUP OF COFFEE -- WHERE YOU LOOKED AT IT AND SAID, "WAIT, THAT WAS AMAZING," THAT WAS NOT FRESH. NEVER IN HISTORY HAS THERE BEEN. THERE'S BEEN OKAY ONES AND "THAT WASN'T BAD" AND "THAT WORKED" AND "THAT WAS FINE FOR ME," BUT NOT THAT ONE WHERE YOU STOPPED WHAT YOU WERE DOING, LOOKED AT YOUR CUP, AND SAID, "WOW. I JUST HAD A TRANSPORTING EXPERIENCE." THAT COFFEE WAS FRESH, I GUARANTEE YOU. BECAUSE SO MANY THINGS THAT ARE GREAT IN COFFEE ARE EVANESCENT. THEY'RE VOLATILE AND THEY'RE AROMATIC AND THEY DISSIPATE ALMOST INSTANTLY. YOU KNOW, AS SOON AS YOU BREW THEM, YOU DRINK THEM IN, YOU SMELL THEM, YOU TASTE THEM THROUGH YOUR OLFACTORY SENSE. AND THEN IT'S GONE, AND YOU CAN NEVER -- YOU CAN NEVER GET THEM BACK AGAIN. - WHEN IT'S HARVEST SEASON, WE NEED EVERY HAND AVAILABLE, AND A FAMILY'S WEALTH FOR THE YEAR DEPENDS ON WHAT THEY CAN HARVEST DURING THAT BRIEF PERIOD OF TIME. SO EVERYBODY WHO'S AVAILABLE TO WORK SHOULD WORK. SO YOU'LL SEE FAMILIES RANGING FROM THE GRANDMOTHERS, THE PARENTS, DOWN TO THE LITTLE KIDS. AND SO YOU MAY HAVE SIX PEOPLE IN ONE FAMILY WORKING SO THAT ONE KID CAN GO TO SCHOOL. - COFFEE UNIFORMLY COMES, IT SEEMS, FROM TRULY BEAUTIFUL PLACES -- REALLY REMOTE AND MOUNTAINOUS PLACES, AND ALSO, IF YOU THINK OF IT, KIND OF THE PERFECT PLACE, BECAUSE COFFEE ONLY COMES FROM THE TROPICAL BAND AROUND THE GLOBE. BUT IDEALLY, I THINK, IT ALSO GROWS IN A BAND BETWEEN 4,000 AND 6,000 FEET. AND IF YOU TRAVEL IN THE TROPICS AND YOU GO TO THOSE ALTITUDES, YOU RECOGNIZE QUICKLY THAT IN THAT BAND, IT'S NOT HOT. AT 6,000 FEET IN THE MOUNTAINS, IT'S TEMPERATE, IT'S COOL, AND THAT ALLOWS FOR THE REALLY SLOW DEVELOPMENT OF COFFEE CHERRIES SO THAT THEY GAIN MORE RIPENESS OVER A LONGER PERIOD, THEREFORE IMPARTING MORE FLAVOR TO THE BEANS. - COFFEE IS A FRUIT, AND IT'S A STONE FRUIT VERY SIMILAR TO CHERRIES OR PEACHES OR APRICOTS. IT'S GOT A LOT OF THOSE SAME ORGANIC COMPOUNDS. AND LIKE ANY OTHER FRUIT OR FRUIT JUICE THAT WE DRINK, WE WANT THE COFFEE TO BE SWEET, BECAUSE THAT'S THE PRODUCT OF RIPENESS. - A COFFEE FRUIT -- IT GROWS ON A SHRUB THAT'S NATIVE TO ETHIOPIA, EAST AFRICA, IN THE TROPICS OF EACH AFRICA, IN THE COOL MOUNTAINS. THERE ARE TWO MAIN SPECIES OF COFFEE THAT WE GROW TO CONSUME, AND THOSE ARE COFFEA ARABICA, WHICH WE CALL ARABICA, AND COFFEA CANEPHORA, WHICH WE CALL ROBUSTA. AND THOSE ARE TWO SPECIES. THEY CAME FROM DIFFERENT PARTS OF AFRICA. IN GENERAL, ARABICA IS THOUGHT TO BE FINER, MORE SPECIAL THAN ROBUSTA IS. - THIS IS A TYPICAL ROBUSTA PLANT, AND USUALLY IT'S A MORE -- IT'S CALLED ROBUSTA BECAUSE IT'S MORE ROBUST. AND THE PLANT CAN GROW UP TO 9, 10 FEET, ALMOST LIKE A TREE. - THE ROBUSTA WILL HAVE LESS THAN HALF OF THE AROMATIC OILS THAT ARE IN AN ARABICA BEAN. SO, IT WILL HAVE NOT MANY AROMAS. BUT IT WILL HAVE MORE CAFFEINE THAN THE ARABICA BEAN AND IT HAS MORE SUGARS. - THE USE OF SINGLE-ORIGIN COFFEE IS A REALLY OBVIOUS NEXT STEP IN THE PROGRESSION OF THE WAY THAT WE LEARN ABOUT COFFEE, AND WHEN YOU'RE USING A MIXTURE OF COFFEES, IT'S A LITTLE BIT MORE DIFFICULT TO ISOLATE THINGS THAN IF YOU USE INDIVIDUAL COFFEE. AND THAT BRINGS YOU TO CHOOSING AN INDIVIDUAL COFFEE. WE START TO GET INTO WHAT WE CALL MICRO-LOT, RIGHT, AND SMALLER AND SMALLER SOURCING. AND WE GET TO HAVE CONTACT WITH INDIVIDUAL PRODUCERS, AND WE GET TO LEARN ABOUT INDIVIDUAL VARIETALS, AND WE GET TO LEARN ABOUT EVERYTHING UNDER THE SUN IN THE DEPARTMENT OF BOTANY. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT, LIKE, SLOPE ANGLE, AND SUN EXPOSURE, AND IRRIGATION, AND THAT'S JUST THE PLANT. THE WAY THAT THE CHERRIES AND THE SEEDS ARE HANDLED AFTER THAT REPRESENT A WHOLE OTHER SUBSET OF VARIABLES THAT AFFECT THE WAY WE BREW. SO, SINGLE ORIGIN MIGHT BE A GIGANTIC BUZZWORD, BUT AT THE HEART OF IT IS THE SAME CONCEPT AS THE WHOLE REST OF OUR TECHNIQUES, WHICH IS THE REDUCTION OF VARIABLES IN THE EFFORT TO DEMYSTIFY AND TO BETTER UNDERSTAND WHAT WE'RE WORKING WITH SO THAT WE CAN PRESENT IT IN A CLEAR WAY. - WE TRADITIONALLY SELL COFFEE BY ITS ORIGIN COUNTRY'S NAME, SO PEOPLE WILL NATURALLY, WHEN THEY START DRINKING GUATEMALAN COFFEE, BE INTERESTED IN WHAT GUATEMALA IS, AND THEY'RE MORE INCLINED TO BE CURIOUS ABOUT THINGS LIKE THE ENVIRONMENT IN GUATEMALA, LIKE SOCIAL CONDITIONS IN GUATEMALA, AND LIKE LABOR CONDITIONS IN GUATEMALA. - THEY SAY THAT COFFEE GETS IN YOUR BLOOD, AND ONCE YOU'RE IN COFFEE, YOU CAN'T LEAVE. AND I THINK THAT TENDS TO BE TRUE. IT'S NOT BECAUSE IT'S SPREADING SOME KIND OF NANOTECHNOLOGY IN YOUR BLOOD STREAM. IT'S BECAUSE IT'S JUST THAT INSPIRING. THERE'S JUST SO MANY PLACES TO FIND. THERE'S SO MANY WAYS TO INDULGE EVERY CURIOSITY YOU HAVE AND APPLY WHATEVER SORT OF SCIENTIFIC OR ARTISTIC FOCUS THAT YOU HAVE. WHEN I WAS IN GUATEMALA, I HAVE A FRIEND THERE WHO HAS BECOME A FRIEND NOW. AT THE TIME, HE WAS JUST A COFFEE FARMER I WAS GOING TO MEET. AND TO GET TO HIS FARM WAS A VERY LONG TRIP. IT'S ABOUT 10 HOURS IN A CAR, A LOT OF IT OVER ROADS THAT ARE NOT VERY GOOD. AND WE'D GONE THERE BECAUSE WE'D TASTED THIS COFFEE AT AN EXPORTER'S OFFICE IN THE CITY, AND IT WAS SO GOOD THAT WE DECIDED WE HAD TO GO SEE WHERE IT CAME FROM. EVERY FARM KIND OF LOOKS A LITTLE BIT THE SAME IN SOME WAYS, AND IN RETROSPECT, I CAN SEE THAT THAT'S DEFINITELY NOT THE CASE. NO TWO FARMS ARE IDENTICAL AND THERE ARE SO MANY SMALL THINGS YOU CAN SEE JUST BY BEING ON A FARM THAT GIVES YOU AN INDICATION ABOUT WHAT THE QUALITY POTENTIAL CAN BE. AT THE MOMENT WHEN WE ARRIVED ON THE FARM, THE FARMER CAME WALKING OUT WITH HIS FAMILY. AND THEN SOMETHING HAPPENED. I WAS AFFECTED BY IT. THERE WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS SO ATTRACTIVE ABOUT THE FARM, AND I STILL LOOK BACK AND TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IT WAS AT THAT TIME THAT MADE ME SO EXCITED. BUT I FEEL THAT IT WAS A COMBINATION OF THE ENERGY OF THE FARMER HIMSELF. THERE WAS SO MUCH WARMTH IN THE WAY HE TALKED ABOUT HIS COFFEE FARM. IT WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT I GOT THE FEELING THAT EVERYTHING WAS JUST MEANT TO BE. I WAS IN THE RIGHT PLACE AT THE RIGHT TIME WITH THE RIGHT PEOPLE. THAT BECAME OUR FIRST DIRECT-TRADE RELATIONSHIP. OUR FIRST FARM AND OUR FIRST FARMER WHERE WE REALLY SAT DOWN AND SAID, "OKAY. WE CAN REALLY HELP EACH OTHER." - EVERY COFFEE HAS A SEASON. MOST COFFEES ARE PICKED ONLY ONCE A YEAR AND THAT COULD BE, SINCE IT'S THE TROPICS, ANY TIME AROUND THE YEAR. SOME COFFEES ARE GREAT IN FALL AND HAVE A HARVEST IN FALL, AND SOME IN WINTER, SOME IN SPRING. AND, SO, YOU REALLY HAVE TO KNOW THE COFFEE TO KNOW WHEN IT'S REALLY AT ITS VERY BEST. - SO THE FIRST THING THAT HAPPENS DURING HARVEST TIME IS THAT THE COFFEE CHERRIES NEED TO BE SELECTIVELY PICKED. WE'VE GOT PICKERS OUT THAT ARE USING A COMBINATION OF SIGHT AND ALSO TOUCH TO IDENTIFY THE CHERRIES THAT ARE IN THE PERFECT STAGE OF RIPENESS. WHEN WE SAY "SELECTIVELY PICKING," THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. ONCE THE COFFEES HAVE BEEN PICKED, THE NEXT STEP IN THE PROCESS IS GENERALLY SORTING SO THAT THE CHERRIES THAT HAVE BEEN PICKED, RARELY WILL THEY BE PICKED PERFECTLY ON THE FIRST TIME. THERE'S ALWAYS GONNA BE A FEW SLIGHTLY OVERRIPE OR UNDER-RIPE CHERRIES PICKED ALONGSIDE THE GOOD ONES. THOSE ARE SORTED BY HAND AND REMOVED NORMALLY BY THE PICKERS. HERE YOU HAVE AN EXAMPLE OF EVERY KIND OF COFFEE YOU COULD PICK, EXCEPT FOR COMPLETELY GREEN. THESE KIND RIGHT HERE -- THIS IS CALLED AN OVER-FERMENTED OR SOBRE MORURU. AND THIS WILL GIVE THE CUP KIND OF A WINE-Y TASTE. IT'S NOT NECESSARILY PLEASANT. YOU DON'T WANT THIS IN YOUR COFFEE. IT'S KIND OF GOT A ROTTING FRUIT OR DECOMPOSING FRUIT TASTE. - HERE WE ARE AT LA SOLEDAD AND THIS FARM HAS BEEN IN THE PEREZ FAMILY FOR ALMOST 100 YEARS. MY GREAT-GRANDFATHER STARTED PLANTING COFFEE HERE AS AN ADVENTURE. THEN HE INHERITED THIS ON MY GRANDFATHER, AND HE PASSED THAT INHERIT TO MY FATHER. MY FATHER TAUGHT ME DURING 20 YEARS THAT I HAVE BEEN WORKING HERE. ONE OF THAT THINGS THAT I THINK IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT IS THE LOVE FOR THIS LAND. THE WAY HE TAUGHT ME THAT, IT WAS VERY, VERY SIMPLE. HE TAUGHT ME HOW TO WORK IT. HE TAUGHT ME HOW TO WORK THE MILL, HOW TO WORK THE COFFEE TREES, HOW TO PICK COFFEE. I THINK THAT'S THE WAY THE LOVE FOR THIS PRODUCT GREW INTO ME, BECAUSE I FEEL PART OF EVERY STEP OF THE PROCESS. HERE THERE IS THE WET-MILL PROCESS OF THE COFFEE. FIRST, THE PICKERS GO TO DIFFERENT AREAS OF THE FARM AND PICK RED CHERRIES. THEN THEY COME HERE TO THESE FACILITIES AND THEY WEIGHT THEIR COFFEE, BECAUSE WE PAY BY THE WEIGHT. - THE FIRST STEP IN MECHANICAL WET MILLING IS THE REMOVAL OF THE SKIN. SO, THE CHERRIES GET PUT INTO A DE-PULPING MACHINE, WHICH SQUEEZES THEM GENTLY OR APPLIES SOME KIND OF PRESSURE TO GET THE SKIN OFF OF THE CHERRY. ONCE THE SKIN IS REMOVED, THE COFFEE IS THEN EITHER PUT THROUGH A MECHANICAL DEMUCILAGING MACHINE, WHICH IS BASICALLY JUST A BIG SCRUBBER THAT GENTLY SCRUBS THE COFFEE AND REMOVES THE STICKY HONEY THAT'S COATING THE OUTSIDE OF THE BEAN. - AFTER THAT, WE PUT THAT AGAIN INTO A WATER IN A MACHINE CALLED WHERE WE SEPARATE IT AGAIN BY DENSITY. THEY'RE SEEDS NOW. AND THEN WE LET A DRY FERMENTATION FOR 27 TO 32 HOURS. - AND THEN WE DO ANOTHER SEPARATION THERE BY DENSITY AGAIN, AND THEN WE DRY THE COFFEE. - WE IN INDIA, WE FOLLOW SUN DRYING RATHER THAN ANY OTHER KIND OF MECHANICAL DRYING. SUN DRYING IS THE BEST AND IT GIVES OUT THE BEST FLAVORS IN COFFEE. DRYING SHOULD BE SUCH THAT BY THE TIME AFTER SIXTH OR SEVENTH DAY, DEPENDING ON THE KIND OF SUN WE HAVE, THE BEAN SHOULD HAVE NOT MORE THAN 11.5 % OF MOISTURE IN THIS. IT SHOULD BE ALWAYS DRIED IN 1 1/2 INCHES THICKNESS SO THAT PROPER AERATION BETWEEN THE BEANS IS THERE. - THE GOOD, GOOD COFFEE THAT HAS A HIGH GRADE GETS EXPORTED TO THE U.S. AND TO EUROPE, AND ALL THE BAD COFFEE, THE STUFF THAT JUST DIDN'T PASS, JUST DIDN'T MAKE IT -- WHATEVER IT IS -- STAYS IN GUATEMALA. SO YOU'RE IN GUATEMALA AND YOU CAN'T HAVE A GREAT CUP OF COFFEE. LIKE... YOU'RE LIKE, "HEY, WE GROW THIS STUFF, MAN." BECAUSE EVERYTHING IS GETTING EXPORTED. BUT IT'S A WAY OF SURVIVAL. - WE WANT TO TRY TO CHANGE THAT HERE IN GUATEMALA BY KEEPING VERY GOOD COFFEES ROASTED THE WAY IT SHOULD BE AND TRY TO TEACH THE PEOPLE THAT WE ARE PRODUCING THE BEST QUALITY COFFEE HERE AS IN THE WORLD, AND WE SHOULD DRINK THAT, TOO. AND TRYING TO CHANGE THAT HAS BEEN HARD, BUT I THINK A LOT OF CHANGE HAS BEEN DONE IN THE PAST TWO YEARS. - AFTER COFFEE IS DRIED, IT HAS COATING ON THE OUTSIDE. WE CALL IT PARCHMENT. AND I ALWAYS THINK IT REMINDS ME OF SORT OF LIKE A PEANUT. YOU KNOW HOW THERE'S THAT PAPERY SHELL ON A PEANUT WITH THE SEED INSIDE? THAT'S WHAT COFFEE IS LIKE. THE MILLING PROCESS IS THE PROCESS OF GETTING THAT SHELL OFF. TO DO THAT, IT GOES THROUGH A MACHINE THAT RUBS IT TOGETHER TO BREAK THAT SHELL AND ESSENTIALLY BLOW IT AWAY. SO, WHAT YOU GET OUT OF THE MILL IS THE SMALL GREEN SEEDS OF THE COFFEE PLANT THAT ARE READY TO BE EXPORTED. - SO, ONCE THE COFFEE DOES ARRIVE AT ONE OF OUR ROASTING PLANTS, WE TASTE IT AGAIN AFTER THAT LONG JOURNEY FROM PRODUCING COUNTRY INTO ONE OF OUR ROASTING PLANTS AGAIN TO MAKE SURE THAT THE QUALITY IS MAINTAINING ITSELF FROM THE TIME OF EXPORT TO THE TIME OF IMPORT. - ROASTING COFFEE IS ALL ABOUT MANAGING HEAT TRANSFER. THE WAY YOU APPLY HEAT TO THE COFFEE AND THE WAY THE BEANS ABSORB THE HEAT IS WHAT MAKES THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A SUCCESSFUL ROAST OR AN UNSUCCESSFUL ONE. AND, REALLY, THE WAY THAT THE HEAT IS ABSORBED IS ALSO CRITICAL IN INFLUENCING AND DIRECTING THE WAY CHEMICAL CHANGES HAPPEN. THERE'S A LOT OF CHEMICAL PRECURSORS IN COFFEE THAT LEAD TO OTHER FLAVORS ONCE THEY'VE BEEN TRANSFORMED AND DEVELOPED IN THE ROASTING PROCESS. AND IT'S A COMPLEX PROCESS. THERE'S SO MANY DIFFERENT CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS IN COFFEE THAT CONTRIBUTE TO FLAVOR AND TO AROMA. AND HOW YOU UNLOCK THEM AND HOW YOU PRESENT THEM IS ONE OF THE GREAT PIECES OF MAGIC AND SCIENCE OF COFFEE ROASTING. - SO, THIS IS A SUPER-HARD COSTA RICA. GOOD COFFEE IN A FRENCH ROAST. THEN YOU GET INTO THE COFFEES LIKE ETHIOPIANS. YOU DON'T WANT TO BURN THOSE BEAUTIFUL FLAVORS OUT OF THE COFFEE. - I'M PUTTING THE BEANS IN THE HOPPER. THE BEANS ARE GREEN BECAUSE THEY CONTAIN A LOT OF WATER. I WANT THAT WATER OUT. EVERY BEAN HAS DIFFERENT DENSITY. THE DENSITY DETERMINES TO ME WHAT TEMPERATURE I SHOULD ROAST. I CANNOT TAKE A LIGHT BEAN, THAT MEANS LIGHT DENSITY, AND PUT IT VERY HIGH TEMPERATURE. I WILL DO VERY FAST. I WILL BRING THAT ACIDITY OUT OF THE BEAN, AND I WILL RUIN THE TASTE OF THAT BEAN. - A LITTLE BIT LONGER TO FIRST POP. IT'S KIND OF STARTING NOW. YOU'LL HEAR IT START TO CRACK. FIRST POP OR FIRST CRACK. THAT CONTROLS THE AIR PRESSURE. COFFEE WILL GO THROUGH A COUPLE OF CHEMICAL REACTIONS IN THE PROCESS OF ROASTING IN WHICH MOISTURE IS RELEASED, AND WHEN THAT HAPPENS, YOU'LL ACTUALLY HEAR A POPPING SOUND VERY SIMILAR TO POPCORN POPPING IN YOUR MICROWAVE OR YOUR POPCORN POPPER. IAN IS ROASTING THE COFFEE USING HIS SENSES -- HIS SENSE OF SMELL, USING EYES TO TRACK COLOR, AND MAKING MOVEMENTS IN TERMS OF APPLYING GAS PRESSURE TO THE COFFEE AS IT'S ROASTING. AS IT PROGRESSES TOWARDS THE END, THIS SPEED OF WHICH THE ROAST COMES INTO THE COFFEE ACCELERATES GREATLY TO THE POINT WHERE THE CALL -- IT'S JUST ON THE SECOND. SO ONE OR TWO SECONDS EITHER WAY CAN THROW OFF THE PROFILE. - I'M LISTENING TO IT. I'M LISTENING TO THE... ACCELERATION OF THE ROAST. I'M SMELLING IT. NOW, IT'S GOING INTO SECOND CRACK. - THE COFFEE IS NICE AND PUFFY -- VERY NICE. IT'S LIKE I'M GIVING MY FINAL TOUCH IN A PAINTING. SO I WAIT A LITTLE BIT MORE TO GET THE CERTAIN COLOR THAT I WANT. - THE COFFEE JUST NOW THAT EXITED THE ROASTER IS APPROXIMATELY 430 DEGREES -- THE BEANS THEMSELVES. THEY'RE INSTANTLY DROPPED INTO THE COOLING TRAY AND AIR IS INDUCTED THROUGH A FAN THAT WE HAVE ON THE ROOF AND QUICKLY COOLS THE COFFEE FROM THAT 430 DEGREES TO ROOM TEMPERATURE WITHIN MINUTES. IT LITERALLY HALTS THE ROASTING PROCESS. WHAT WE DON'T WANT TO DO IS HAVE THE COFFEE COOL SLOWLY BECAUSE OF THE AFFECT THAT THAT HAS, THE COFFEE WILL CONTINUE TO COOK. THIS IS AN ESPRESSO ROAST, SO WHAT IAN IS LOOKING FOR, IN TERMS OF COLOR-WISE IN THE ROAST, IS HE WANTS TO SEE JUST THAT PARTICULAR LEVEL OF SHEEN JUST PRIOR TO THE OILS COMING OUT TO THE SURFACE OF THE COFFEE. - WHEN I USED TO ROAST, I USED TO BURN. I'D FORGET -- I USED TO TOUCH THE DRUM, I USED TO BURN MY HAND AND CRY. MY DAD USED TO SAY, "LET ME SEE. LET ME SEE." I WOULD SHOW HIM THE BURN. HE SAYS, "OH, THIS IS GOOD. NOW THE SECRET WENT IN YOUR BLOOD AND YOU WILL NOT FORGET." IT USED TO MAKE ME SO HAPPY THAT I GOT THE SECRET, YOU KNOW? - ESPRESSO IS LIKE THE COMMUNAL BEVERAGE, AND THIS IS SOMETHING I THINK THAT IS RIGHT ABOUT ITALIAN COFFEE CULTURE, IS YOU WALK UP TO THE COFFEE BAR, YOU GO TO THE SAME ONE EVERY DAY, YOU SEE ALL THE SAME PEOPLE YOU SEE EVERY DAY, YOU KIND OF CONNECT WITH YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD FOR JUST A MOMENT BEFORE YOU GO ON TO WHATEVER IS THE IMPORTANT THING YOU HAVE TO DO NEXT, AND IT'S KIND OF LIKE A COMING TOGETHER OF PEOPLE. IT'S LIKE THIS SORT OF THROBBING MASS, YOU KNOW? IT'S LIKE PEOPLE ARE COMING IN AND OUT. THE PERFECT SHOT OF ESPRESSO HAS TO BE HAD IN A COFFEE BAR. - ONE OF THE MAJOR JOBS OF THE PRODUCER IS TO CREATE A MACHINE VERY FLEXIBLE -- MEANS ABLE TO ADAPT TO THE NEEDS OF EACH BARISTA AND IS CONSISTENT AT THE SAME TIME. SO, ONCE A BARISTA'S FOUND HIS PROFILE, PRETEND THAT THAT PROFILE CAN BE THE SAME FOR ALL DAY, ALL THE WEEK, ALL THE MONTH. THIS IS A BIG CHALLENGE BECAUSE THE CONDITION -- EXCELLENT CONDITION -- CHANGES CONTINUOUSLY, AND THE MACHINE CAN BE STABLE. 'CAUSE SPECIALTY REQUIRES GOOD-SKILLED BARISTA, ABLE TO MAKE A VERY HIGH QUALITY ESPRESSO. THIS CAN BE DONE JUST WITH A TRADITIONAL MACHINE. - AT THE TIME, IT WAS KIND OF A NEW PRODUCT FOR MANY AMERICANS. IT WAS MORE ABOUT AN AMERICAN MODEL OF AN ITALIAN STYLE DRINK, AND I THINK WHAT'S HAPPENED SINCE THEN AND OVER THE LAST DECADE FOR SURE IS THAT AMERICA HAS KIND OF FOUND ITS OWN POINT OF VIEW WITH THE PRODUCT. AND, SO, WE DEFINITELY, YOU KNOW, TOOK OUR ORIGINAL INSPIRATION FROM THE ITALIAN MODEL, BUT NOW PEOPLE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO EXPERIMENT THAT AND DEFINE IT IN THEIR OWN WAY. AND SO WHAT YOU'RE SEEING IS THIS NEW WAVE OF INNOVATION, NEW STYLES OF BEVERAGES, MORE ATTENTION TO THE COFFEE PART OF THE PRODUCT. THAT'S REALLY EXCITING. - COFFEE BEANS REPRESENT NOT MORE THAN 50 % OF THE FINAL RESULT. 50 % IS GIVEN BY THE BEANS, BY THE QUALITY, BY THE MIXING, BY THE ROASTING, BY ALL THE OTHER TECHNICAL THINGS. BUT THE OTHER 50 % IS GIVEN BY THE TOOLS, THE EQUIPMENT, THE MACHINE, THE GRINDERS, AND THE HAND OF THE BARISTA. - FROM KENYA -- VERY CLOSE TO IT. HERE WE GO. - ONE OF THE MOST JOYFUL PARTS AND BEAUTIFUL PARTS OF MY COFFEE CAREER WAS WHEN I WAS LEARNING ABOUT WHAT MADE COFFEE TASTE BETTER. THAT OPENED MY EYES TO TECHNIQUE. WE WANT TO GIVE PEOPLE -- BARISTAS OR CONSUMERS -- ACCESS TO THAT SAME SENSE OF DISCOVERY AND EXPLORATION. - BUT WHAT'S REALLY KIND OF REFRESHING IN A WAY IS THAT I REALLY FEEL LIKE THE ENTIRE SPECIALTY INDUSTRY IS HEADED BACK TOWARDS SIMPLICITY AND EDUCATION. SO, INSTEAD OF TRYING TO AUTOMATE THE PROCESS TO WHERE THE USER OR THE BARISTA HAS TO JUST PUSH A BUTTON, NOW WE'RE INVESTING MORE IN THE SKILLS OF THE ACTUAL PERSON, WHICH IS A MUCH MORE SUSTAINABLE MODEL -- WHEN YOU GIVE SOMEONE SKILLS THAT THEY HAVE FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIFE AND THAT THEY CAN EDUCATE OTHERS INSTEAD OF TRYING TO AUTOMATE EVERYTHING INTO QUICK SERVICE. - I WOULD DEFINITELY LIKE TO OPEN UP MY OWN COFFEEHOUSE AT ONE POINT. I THINK ANY BARISTA THAT'S BEEN DOING THIS FOR ANY AMOUNT OF TIME WILL SAY THE SAME THING. - IT'S ALMOST A THEATER. IT'S A COFFEE THEATER. YOU'RE TAKING, YOU KNOW, THIS ANCIENT DRINK AND PRESENTING IT TO THEM IN A NEW WAY. WHEN THEY TAKE A SIP OF THAT COFFEE AND IT BLOWS THEM AWAY, THAT'S THE EXCITING PART OF THE BUSINESS. - THE TWO MOST IMPORTANT SKILLS FOR A BARISTA HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH HOW YOU CAN HOLD A PORTA FILTER AND POUR AWESOME LATTE ARTS. YOU HAVE TO KNOW HOW TO TASTE. YOU MUST, BECAUSE TASTE IS THE ONLY SORT OF GOALPOST THAT SHOWS YOU HOW YOUR TECHNIQUE IS INFLUENCING THE COFFEE. AND YOU HAVE TO BE, YOU KNOW, A RIGOROUS HOSPITALITARIAN -- IS A WORD I MADE UP. BUT YOU HAVE TO ACTUALLY CONSIDER THAT TO BE VIRTUOUS AND INTERESTING. YOU HAVE TO WANT TO SERVE PEOPLE. - WHEN I HAVE A CUSTOMER COME UP TO ME, THERE'S NOTHING BETTER THAN THE QUESTION OF, "WELL, WHAT DO YOU THINK I SHOULD GET?" I JUST GO, "YES!" YOU KNOW? BECAUSE IT'S THAT MOMENT. IT'S LIKE, YOU KNOW, A HANDFUL OF MOMENTS WHERE WE GET THAT OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY GO, "I KNOW EXACTLY THIS THING THAT YOU'RE GONNA TRY. LET'S TASTE IT TOGETHER," YOU KNOW? I THINK THAT'S WHAT BRIDGES THE GAP -- THE KIND OF INTERACTION AND THE KIND OF PERSONALITY THAT YOU HAVE AS A BARISTA, OF JUST REALLY CARING, NOT ONLY ABOUT THE PRODUCT, BUT ALSO ABOUT THE CUSTOMER THAT'S STANDING IN FRONT OF YOU. - A HUGE THING IN THE EARLY 2000s WHEN WE STARTED TO WORK WITH COFFEE FARMS -- THE THING THAT WE HAD TO DO WAS LEARN TO SPEAK THE SAME LANGUAGE, AND I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT SPOKEN LANGUAGE. I'M TALKING ABOUT FLAVOR LANGUAGE. THAT'S WHY CUPPING IS SO IMPORTANT AND HAS SUCH AN IMPORTANT PLACE IN GREAT COFFEE. I INTERACTED WITH ALL SORTS OF COFFEE FARMERS THAT DIDN'T LOVE COFFEE BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T DRINK COFFEE BECAUSE THEIR CULTURE WASN'T TO DRINK COFFEE. OVER THE YEARS, WE'VE DONE LOTS OF STRATEGIES TO GET FARMERS TO DRINK THEIR OWN COFFEE, OR AT LEAST TASTE IT. - I HAVE TO IDENTIFY SWEETNESS WITHOUT LOOKING AT THE BITTERNESS, WHICH IS QUITE DIFFICULT. I HAVE THE COLLOIDS IN SUSPENSION. I HAVE MY SUGARS. I HAVE THE PROTEINS. I HAVE SO MANY, YOU KNOW, DIFFERENT COMPOUNDS THROUGH, LITERALLY, LIKE A MAZE, AND I HAVE TO WEAVE MY WAY IN AND OUT OF THAT MAZE TO BE ABLE TO COME TO ONE CONCLUSION -- WHETHER THE COFFEE IS OF AVERAGE OR SPECIALTY GRADE, OR WHETHER IT IS OF COMMERCIAL VALUE. I'VE BEEN IN COFFEE FOR ALMOST 38 YEARS. AND MY MAIN FOCUS OF WORK WAS TO TASTE COFFEES, EVALUATE COFFEES, RATE THE COFFEES IN TERMS OF THE QUALITY NORMS, GO BACK TO THE FARMER AND TELL THEM WHAT, YOU KNOW -- WHETHER HE IS DOING THE PROCESSING RIGHT OR WHAT'S RIGHT ABOUT HIS COFFEE, WHAT'S WRONG ABOUT HIS COFFEE. AND IF THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG, WHY IS IT WRONG? WHAT ARE THE CORRECTIVE FACTORS? WHAT STEPS DOES HE NEED TO TAKE TO UPGRADE THE COFFEE? BASICALLY, ALL THIS IS DONE THROUGH THE PALATE. - CUPPING, IT'S ONE OF THE COFFEE TECHNIQUES THAT ARE USED BY CUPPERS TO... EVALUATE AROMA AND FLAVOR PROFILE OF COFFEE. IT OPENS YOUR EYES TO A WIDE RANGE OF POSSIBILITIES, TO UNDERSTAND WHAT SPECIALTY COFFEE IS ABOUT AND WHAT'S SO SPECIAL ABOUT THE COFFEE AND, ALSO, IT GIVES YOU AN OPPORTUNITY TO UNDERSTAND FLAVORS AND NUANCES -- SOMETHING YOU DIDN'T EVEN KNOW EXISTED IN THE COFFEE. THE FIRST ONE, YOU EVALUATE FRAGRANCE AND AROMA. FRAGRANCE WOULD REFER TO THE DRIED COFFEE GROUNDS, SO YOU EVALUATE THESE FIRST. - WHEN WE BREW THE LIQUID, WHEN YOU POUR WATER, THERE'S AN AROMATICS THAT COME OUT, THE VOLATILES COME OUT, AND THAT'S CALLED THE AROMA. SO I SMELL THE COFFEE, AND WE BREW IT FOR ABOUT FOUR MINUTES AND THEN WE TASTE. WE BREAK THE CRUST AND THEN WE TASTE. AND WHEN I TASTE, I'M LOOKING AT THE APTITUDE OF STRENGTH, THE MOUTH FEEL, THE VISCOSITY OF THE LIQUID ON MY PALATE. - WHEN YOU SLURP THE COFFEE, THE LIQUID THAT YOU'RE SLURPING GOES ALL OVER YOUR MOUTH, SO YOU CAN BASICALLY -- EASIER TO IDENTIFY AND TASTE THE FLAVORS AND HOW YOU PERCEIVE THE AROMATIC FLAVORS AND PERCEIVE THE ACIDITY AND THE BODY OF THE COFFEE. - WE LOOK AT THE FLAVOR TO SEE WHAT IS THE FLAVOR. IS IT FLORAL? IS IT FLAVOR OF CARAMEL, CHOCOLATE? HAS IT GOT A LITTLE BIT OF APRICOT OR PLUMS OR BANANAS? WE LOOK AT THE BRIGHTNESS OR THE TANGINESS OF THE ACIDITY, AND THAT'S AN IMPORTANT ATTRIBUTE. - THIS SHAPE IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE YOU SMELL BETTER. IT'S LIKE -- LIKE THE GLASS WITH WINE TASTING, AND THIS WILL KEEP THE SMELL OF THE COFFEE AND THE POWERFULNESS OF THE COFFEE. SO, YOU WILL DETECT IT BETTER. WE ARE PUTTING IN ONE CUP -- WE'LL PUT SUGAR. IN THE OTHER CUP, WE'LL LEAVE IT WITHOUT SUGAR. SO, EDDIE WILL NOW SHOW US HOW WE DO THE PROPER CUP TASTING. FIRST, HE WILL SMELL. - HE WILL TASTE THE BITTER CUP WITHOUT SUGAR. THEN WE'LL CUP-TASTE THE COFFEE -- THE CUPS WITH SUGAR. THIS IS AN EXCEPTIONAL COFFEE. HAS, I WOULD SAY A MEDIUM BODY, BUT HAS A VERY STRONG FLORAL AROMA, CITRUS-LIKE FLAVORS, AND MARMALADE -- ORANGE MARMALADE. - THE CUP OF EXCELLENCE IS A PRODUCING COUNTRIES' COMPETITION TO FIND THE BEST COFFEES OF THAT PARTICULAR HARVEST SEASON. DURING THE COMPETITION, SOMETHING LIKE 100 PLUS CUPS ARE SAMPLED THROUGHOUT THE LOT AND PREPARED AND EVALUATED BY UPWARDS OF 20 PEOPLE PER SESSION. I DON'T KNOW OF ANY OTHER COFFEE THAT GOES THROUGH THAT DEGREE OF SELECTION IN ORDER TO GET THESE AWARDS. - IN THE UNITED STATES, WHEN A FARMER TAKES OUT A LOAN, THEY CAN USE THEIR CROP AS COLLATERAL FOR THE LOAN BECAUSE THEY'RE PRETTY SURE THAT IT'S GONNA BE -- YOU KNOW, AT THE END OF THE SEASON, THEY'RE GONNA HAVE A WHEAT CROP OR WHATEVER IT HAPPENS TO BE. HERE IN CENTRAL AMERICA, THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO DO THAT. THEY PUT UP THEIR LAND. THEY ACTUALLY HAVE TO MORTGAGE THEIR LAND FOR THE LOAN BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THE PRICE OF COFFEE IS GONNA BE AT THE END OF THE SEASON. IT'S JUST NOT THAT PREDICTABLE. - IN THE BEGINNING, WHEN IT WAS STARTED WAY BACK IN 1999, IT WAS AN EXPERIMENT. WE HAD NO IDEA WHAT WE WERE GONNA FIND. ALL WE KNEW WAS THAT THE FARMERS IN BRAZIL HAD PUT A LOT OF EFFORT INTO INCREASING THE QUALITY ON THEIR FARMS, AND NO ONE WOULD REWARD THEM FOR IT. NO ONE WOULD PAY ANY ATTENTION TO ALL THE WORK THEY HAD DONE, AND ALL THEY KEPT SAYING WAS THAT BRAZIL COULDN'T PRODUCE QUALITY COFFEE AT ALL. SO, DURING THAT PROJECT, AS AN EXPERIMENT, WE SAID TO THEM, "WELL, YOU COME DOWN HERE AND YOU CUP THESE COFFEES, AND YOU DETERMINE WHICH COFFEES YOU THINK ARE THE BEST." AND SO THEY DID. THEY CAME DOWN. AND THEN WE SAID, "WELL, THEN WHAT? WHAT DO WE GIVE THE FARMERS AS A REWARD? YOU CAN'T JUST GIVE A FARMER A CERTIFICATE. YOU CAN'T TAKE A CERTIFICATE TO THE BANK." WE DECIDED TO HAVE AN INTERNET AUCTION. NOW, NOBODY HAD EVER DONE AN INTERNET AUCTION FOR ANY PRODUCT LIKE COFFEE. AND SO WE DEVELOPED THIS INTERNET AUCTION AND THE FARMERS THOUGHT WE HAD LOST OUR MIND. THEY THOUGHT WE WERE CRAZY, AND THEY MADE US BUY THEIR COFFEE AT THE C PRICE BEFORE THEY'D EVEN LET US TAKE IT TO AUCTION. WHEN WE TOOK IT TO AUCTION, IT BROKE ALL THE PRICES THAT THEY'D EVER GOTTEN, AND THAT WAS THE FIRST PROGRAM. AND WHETHER YOU WIN OR WHETHER YOU DON'T... - YOU GUYS, THE FARMERS, ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF THE COFFEE INDUSTRY. - IT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S VERY TRICKY FOR COFFEE FARMERS, IS THAT IT'S NEVER COMPLETE CERTAINTY. AND THIS IS ONE OF THE AREAS WHERE THERE'S A LOT OF RISK INVOLVED IN FARMING, BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO MAKE DECISIONS TODAY THAT YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO GET ANY RESULTS FROM FOR THREE, FOUR, SOMETIMES FIVE YEARS. SO, IF IT DIDN'T WORK, YOU'D HAVE TO START AGAIN -- MAYBE ANOTHER FOUR YEARS. SO, THERE'S QUITE A LOT OF GAMBLING THAT GOES IN COFFEE, AND IT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY FARMERS ARE VERY RELUCTANT TO TRY THINGS THAT ARE NEW TO THEM. AS ROASTERS, WE CAN TRY A NEW ROASTING STYLE, AND IF IT DOESN'T WORK, WE WASTED 15 MINUTES OF TIME AND MAYBE $100 OF COFFEE. BUT IF A FARMER IS TRYING TO EXPERIMENT WITH TREE VARIETIES, YOU KNOW, THEY'RE LOOKING AT FOUR YEARS OF INVESTMENT AND A LOT OF HOPE. - THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE THAT COFFEE FARMERS HAVE ISN'T THAT THEY CAN'T SELL THEIR COFFEE FOR ENOUGH PER POUND. IT'S THAT THEY JUST DON'T HAVE ENOUGH OF IT TO SELL BECAUSE THEIR FARM IS SO SMALL. SO, THERE'S NOT MUCH THAT SOMETHING LIKE THE CUP OF EXCELLENCE CAN DO ABOUT THAT, YOU KNOW? EVEN IF A COFFEE FARMER SELLS HIS COFFEE FOR $25 A POUND, IF HIS FARM IS VERY SMALL, IT'S STILL GONNA NOT BE ENOUGH. - EVERYONE'S MAKING MONEY AT THE TOP OF THE SCALE, RIGHT? THE BROKER'S MAKING MONEY, THE SHIPPING COMPANIES ARE MAKING MONEY, THE ROASTERS ARE MAKING MONEY BECAUSE THEY COME IN OR WHATEVER IT IS, BUT THE GUY WHO'S ALWAYS GONNA MAKE THE SAME AMOUNT OF MONEY IS THE GUY WHO'S PICKING IT. HE DOESN'T CARE ABOUT THAT, BECAUSE THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. "OH, GUESS WHAT -- THE PRICE IS LIKE $10 A POUND FOR RAW COFFEE!" "OH, I'M STILL GETTING PAID BY DAY, DUDE. I'M NOT GETTING PAID MORE THAN WHAT I WORK." SO THEY'RE ALWAYS GONNA BE HURT ALL THE TIME. - IF FARMERS ARE HUNGRY, THEY'RE NOT GONNA FOCUS ON THE QUALITY OF THEIR COFFEE, SO WE NEED TO ADDRESS THE BIGGER PICTURE HERE. THEY UNDERSTAND THAT WE'RE INTERESTED IN SOMETHING BIGGER THAN JUST A POUND OF COFFEE OR A CONTAINER OF COFFEE. - AT THE HEART OF EVERY DIRECT TRADE RELATIONSHIP IS THAT, YOU KNOW, ULTIMATELY, WE TRUST THE FARMERS THAT WE'RE WORKING WITH TO DO ALL OF THE THINGS THAT THEY SAY THAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO, BECAUSE WE CAN'T BE AT EVERY FARM EVERY DAY, ALL YEAR LONG. AND AT THE SAME TIME, THE FARMERS TRUST US THAT WE'RE GOING TO DO WHAT WE SAY WE'RE DOING AND WHAT WE PROMISED TO DO, WHICH IS TO PAY VERY GREAT PRICES FOR THE COFFEES, TO PAY PREMIUMS FOR ADDITIONAL QUALITY, TO REWARD EXCELLENCE WHEREVER WE SEE IT, AND THEN TO REPRESENT THOSE COFFEES FOR THEM IN OUR MARKETS. PRESENT THEM TO CONSUMERS WITH ALL OF THEIR QUALITY STILL INTACT -- NOT POORLY ROASTED, NOT OVER-ROASTED OR UNDER-ROASTED, NOT POORLY EXTRACTED, BUT TO REALLY DELIVER ON THE PROMISE OF THAT COFFEE AND HELP TO ACT IN THAT ROLE AS AMBASSADORS FOR THE COFFEE. - IF WE DON'T MAKE OURSELVES AWARE -- AND I WOULD SAY THIS IS BOTH FOR COFFEE ROASTERS AND FOR CONSUMERS -- JUST PAY ATTENTION. PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT WE'RE DOING TO THE ENTIRE GLOBE WITH SOME OF OUR BEHAVIORS AND THE WAY THAT WE BUY THINGS. KNOW THAT THERE'S AN IMPACT. YOU KNOW, VOTE WITH YOUR WALLET. IN ESSENCE, VOTE WITH YOUR FEET. SUPPORT THOSE PEOPLE THAT ARE TRYING TO DO A GOOD JOB. SUPPORT THOSE ROASTERS THAT ARE REALLY TRYING TO HELP FARMERS. - WE GET TO HAVE THIS EXPERIENCE THAT OTHER INDUSTRIES DON'T HAVE ABOUT BRIDGING THOSE GAPS. YOU KNOW, WE'VE BROUGHT FARMERS AND PRODUCERS TO COME AND SHARE THEIR STORIES WITH OUR CUSTOMERS, WHERE, YOU KNOW, AROUND ONE TABLE, YOU CAN HAVE THAT WHOLE SUPPLY CHAIN. AND THAT IS JUST AN AMAZING EXPERIENCE, ESPECIALLY IN A WORLD THAT'S SO DISCONNECTED AND SO COMMERCIALIZED AND CAN BE SO COLD. HAVING THOSE EXPERIENCES THAT TIE US TO OUR FOOD IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO PEOPLE. - ALL THESE EFFORTS COMBINED ARE HELPING THE FUTURE OF SPECIALTY COFFEE. SO, JUST IN TERMS OF THE PRICES, YOU KNOW, GOOD, SOUND, ETHICAL COFFEE ROASTERS WILL FIGURE OUT A WAY TO PAY THAT MONEY FOR GREEN COFFEE BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT IT'S NOT, YOU KNOW, A JAB TO GET MORE MONEY OUT OF THEM. IT'S SOMETHING THAT REALLY IS FOR THE BETTER OF THE INDUSTRY AS A WHOLE. - I THINK IF YOU JUST LOOK AT IT ON THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL LEVEL AND TALK ABOUT WHAT IS -- WHAT DOES SUSTAINABILITY LOOK LIKE IN COFFEE? I THINK THE FIRST THING THAT YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO ANSWER IS, IS GROWING COFFEE SOMETHING THAT IS A LEGITIMATE AND VIABLE CAREER CHOICE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE? AND YOU SEE A LOT OF VERY OLD FARMERS UP THERE AND FEWER YOUNG FARMERS EVERY YEAR, AND THERE'S A REASON FOR THAT. IT'S BECAUSE THE CHILDREN OF COFFEE GROWERS HAVE SEEN THE WAY THEIR PARENTS WERE LIVING AND DECIDED THAT'S NOT ATTRACTIVE, THAT'S NOT AN EXCITING CAREER PATH, AND THEY'RE LEAVING COFFEE TO DO OTHER THINGS. WHAT WOULD IT TAKE FOR A YOUNG SON OR DAUGHTER OF A COFFEE GROWER TO DECIDE THAT THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT TO DO WITH THEIR LIFE? THEY WANT TO RUN A COFFEE FARM AND PRODUCE GREAT COFFEE. - SOMEONE ONCE SAID THAT WHAT WE DO HERE AS CITIZENS, AS ACTIVISTS, TO PROMOTE CHANGE -- REAL CHANGE -- IMPACTS EVERYONE IN THE WORLD. IF YOU FIND OUT THAT THOSE ARE REAL STORIES OF PEOPLE, AND KNOWING THOSE REAL STORIES OF PEOPLE HELPS YOU IN UNDERSTANDING WHAT THEIR LIVES ARE LIKE, WHAT THEIR DILEMMAS ARE, WHAT THEIR CHALLENGES ARE. - THINGS LIKE THE CUP OF EXCELLENCE AND DIRECT TRADE AND THINGS THAT REALLY VALUE -- PUT PLACE A PREMIUM ON COFFEES THAT TASTE REALLY GOOD -- IS THEY SPEAK TO THE IDEA OF EQUITY THAT THE FARMER DESERVES. WHO CREATED THAT QUALITY IN THE FIRST PLACE, GETS TO PROSPER BY IT, AT LEAST AS MUCH AS ANYBODY ELSE IN THE CHAIN. AND THAT CONCEPT IS VERY IMPORTANT, AND IT MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE A DIRECT AFFECT ON THAT FARMER THAT DAY, BUT IT'S PART OF WHAT WE NEED TO DO IN THE LONG TERM, WHICH IS CREATE BETTER LIVELIHOODS FOR PEOPLE IN AGRICULTURE ALL OVER THE WORLD GROWING ALL SORTS OF THINGS. - SUSTAINABLE HARVEST IS A SOCIAL ENTERPRISE BASED IN PORTLAND, OREGON, THAT IMPORTS GREEN SPECIALTY COFFEE THAT COMES FROM FARMS THAT WE HAVE DIRECT RELATIONSHIPS WITH. AND THE FOCUS IS THAT WE TRY TO MAKE A MORE DIRECT CONNECTION BETWEEN THE GROWERS AND THE ROASTERS, WHERE THE GROWERS KNEW WHO THEY WERE SELLING TO AND THE BUYERS KNEW WHO THEY WERE BUYING FROM. - WHEN SUSTAINABLE HARVEST STAFF WENT DOWN TO VISIT THE COOPERATIVE, THEY MET A LOT OF THE WOMEN AND TALKED WITH FATIMA, AND AS THEY WERE CUPPING THROUGH THE COFFEES THAT THE COOPERATIVE HAD TO SELL, THEY REALIZED THAT MANY OF THE BEST QUALITY COFFEES WERE COMING FROM WOMEN PRODUCERS. AND THAT STARTED A CONVERSATION, WHICH EVENTUALLY LED TO THE IDEA TO SELL AND MARKET A WOMEN'S PRODUCED COFFEE. THEY DEVELOPED THE IDEA TO BRAND THE COFFEE AND CALL IT LAS HERMANAS, WHICH MEANS "THE SISTERS." THE IDEA BEING TO PROMOTE AND RECOGNIZE THE ROLE THAT WOMEN WERE PLAYING IN THIS REALLY IMPORTANT ECONOMIC ACTIVITY IN NICARAGUA AND FOR THEIR FAMILIES. - COFFEE OF LAS HERMANAS BEING IN PLACES LIKE PEET'S, BEING HELD AS A COFFEE THAT EVERY SUMMER WOULD COME OUT AS A SPECIAL RESERVE, THE CONNECTION THAT THE WOMEN FARMERS HAD OF SEEING THEIR OWN PRODUCT WITH A NAME THAT THEY CONTROLLED, THAT REPRESENTED THE WORK OF SOPPEXCCA. IT WAS NO LONGER JUST A NICARAGUAN COFFEE. IT WAS THEIR COFFEE. - COFFEE HAS BEEN VALUED SINCE THE BEGINNING FOR ITS STIMULANT EFFECT, AND THAT'S THE REASON WHY PEOPLE STARTED TO GET INTERESTED IN IT, BUT IT IS SO MUCH MORE THAN THAT. - IT EVOKES A PASSION WITHIN EACH ONE OF US. IT IS FOR ME -- IT IS LITERALLY -- IT'S BEEN MY LIFE FORCE AND I'VE BEEN IN THIS FOR 38 YEARS. AND EVERY DAY, WHEN I LOOK INTO THE CUP, I SEE SOMETHING DIFFERENT, AND THAT'S WHAT I LIKE ABOUT MY JOB. EVERY DAY I CUP, THERE'S SOMETHING DIFFERENT. IT TELLS ME A DIFFERENT STORY. IT MAKES ME RE-THINK AND IT HUMBLES ME, YOU KNOW? EVEN IF I SAY I KNOW IT ALL, I DON'T KNOW IT, BECAUSE, EVERY DAY, I'M COMING UP WITH SOMETHING ELSE. AND I THINK, YOU KNOW, TO THINK THAT A TINY BEAN WHICH COMES FROM A LITTLE FRUIT CAN HUMBLE AN INDIVIDUAL -- I THINK THAT BEAN NEEDS A GREAT, GREAT DEAL OF RESPECT. - UNDERSTANDING WHAT'S BEHIND THE TASTE, WHAT'S BEHIND THE FOOD, WHAT'S BEHIND THE COFFEE, AND ONCE WE START TO LOOK, WE PEEL BACK THE CURTAIN AND WE SEE THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE BEHIND THAT FOOD AND PEOPLE BEHIND THE COFFEE WHO DEPEND ON ITS PRODUCTION FOR THEIR LIVELIHOODS. - THERE ARE SO MANY HANDS THAT TOUCH COFFEE BETWEEN ITS PRODUCTION AND ITS CONSUMPTION, AND THE STORY TOLD BY THOSE HANDS IS WHAT COFFEE REPRESENTS. IT GIVES EVERY CUP ITS STORY. * SUNSHINE * SOFT RAIN * NO YEAR'S THE SAME * RICH SOIL * SURE HANDS * FRUIT OF YOUR LAND * UNIVERSAL ROLE REVERSAL * SISTERS, BROTHERS * SERVING OTHERS * LA VIDA CAFEíNADA * LA VIDA ANIMADA * MOUNTAIN * MAGIC * REACH OUT AND GRAB IT * WARM HANDS * WARM HEARTS * EACH DAY, FRESH STARTS * I GET UP EACH DAY AND SMILE * THROUGH THE YEARS, IT'S ALL WORTHWHILE * * LA VIDA CAFEíNADA * LA VIDA ANIMADA * LA VIDA CAFEíNADA * LA VIDA CAFEíNADA * LA VIDA ANIMADA * LA VIDA CAFEíNADA * LA VIDA ANIMADA
