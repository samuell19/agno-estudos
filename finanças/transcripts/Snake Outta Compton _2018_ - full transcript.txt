Subtitles by explosiveskull You're about to witness the strength of snake knowledge. Get this motherfuckin' snake off this motherfuckin' plane! Welcome to Compton, California. The Sarge partnered us up together so I can teach you the ropes, huh? So today is your first day to commence the training to become a Compton, California, police officer. My training day. Yeah, you can call it that. And one of the first lessons you've gotta learn is how to stay cool under pressure. Always expect the unexpected. Expect the unexpected. You see, I've been on the force for 15 years, huh? And nothing surprises me anymore. Holy Mother of Jesus! Stay cool under pressure. Stay cool under pressure. Screw that, rookie! It's raining snakes. This is some biblical shit right here! Hmm. It appears we have an embryo from the reptilian Colubridae family. - An undamaged egg. - Hey, homeboy. Neon. - Hey, Vurkel. - Neon... Not you, Vurkel! She's waving at me. - Neon. - What's up? - What up, girl? - Nothing. You're crazy. Why are you so early at the party? We ain't even set up yet. You know I gotta go to work later. Work? We need you here so you can sing your verses. We not a band without you. Reptilian stem cells! What you talkin' about, V? If I can activate the reptilian stem cells in this newly hatched snake, the potential for growth would be nearly unlimited. Here he goes again. I don't know what he's talking about. Why must I be cursed with a mad scientist roommate? - Oh, it tickles. - Damn, V! You better work on those dance moves if you wanna get any play at the party. What party? Just a little warm-up gig. Did you ask your Grandma? I need isolation for my experiments. Don't be a buzzkill, Vurkel. Damn, Pinball, don't be a waxed scrote! You should hang with us at the party, Vurkel. Wow, Neon inviting me to a party. I'll go anywhere you go, my lo... Whoa, don't get fresh, Boo. Just bein' neighborly. I've gotta study the specimen in my lab. Okay, well, what you got in there, anyway? - What have I got? - Yeah. I got a snake. A little snake. - Wanna see him? - How little are we talk... Nobody wants to see your little snake, Vurkel. Only snake Neon wants to see is Cam's big black mamba. Get out of my face. - Cam's coming tonight. - Naturally, Vurkel. He is the leader of the crew. We wouldn't be a rap crew without him. All hail Cam. Cam. What's up, what's up? What's up? Party, party. Those idiots! There's so much more to life than infantile partying. I'm more concerned about you 'cause you're small. But we'll show them who's itsy-bitsy. First the snake, then... They'll never call me "little man" again. All systems ready. Activate. It works! It works! So I was at this rooftop party the other night, I mean, it was totally bangin', you know what I mean? Like, the sound system up there is baller. See, that's what I'm talkin' about. Managing music and shit. That's what I want to do. Well, I mean, you gotta be, like, real pro, you know? You can't go around mixing business and pleasure like this, you know? When am I gonna hear those new sick beats you were gonna spin for me? You want me to spin it for business? Or pleasure? Well, well, well. My man. Nice of you to finally show up. I ain't your man, Neon. Damn, Cam. I didn't mean it like that. I meant like, my man, like, my homeboy. Aright, girl. You got those pipes warmed up? These people gonna love you once you drop them bomb dulcet tones. Cam, what makes you think I want somebody's love? Child, a girl can't survive off that. She needs cash flow. That's all gonna be taken care of once Uppercase Records sees our talent tomorrow. Yo, Pinball! Yo, Pinball. Pinball, man. When you gonna play the track for that talent agent friend of yours, man? This is her. R.E.L., meet Beez Neez. Beez Neez! Oh, my God! Your raps are T-I-T. Yeah. We spared no expense on this track. Nothing but high production quality. Pinball's homegirl's gots the hookup. I got you all into Uppercase Records tomorrow. We meetin' with the head cat himself. They don't need any more drama, all right? Did you all steal the money to produce that record? - Steal? You calling me a thief? - No! - Are you saying we stole? - No, no, no, no. Yo, my man borrowed a grip from Alley Jaws. - Alley Jaws? - Yeah. Yo, that dude is mad shady, yo. Ease up, Carrot Top. My sweet Carrot Top. ♪ Couldn't you just get any Chick to sing your hooks? ♪ You trippin'. Can't any chick just bust glass with her high notes. - Look, that only happened once. - This crew needs you.

System overload. Wait, what? Pinball! Yo, it's the Alley Jaws. Pinball, I thought you said you were T-I-T tight. We are tight. Just let me talk to him. - Pinball! - He likes me. I want my money! Where you at? I can hear your lame-ass beats a mile away. - You better have my money! - Alley Jaws. It's so good to see... I thought I recognized the sound of your AK-47. You brought your beautiful ladies here. You always know how to show up unannounced. What can I do for you today? - Where's my money? - Money! - Money. - Money! But you said I can pay you back next week, remember? Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no... - No, no, no, no. - No, no, no. That is repayment of the principal sum. We are talking about the interest. And I ain't the patient type. Unless you want me to go compound on your ass. Compound on my ass? Compound's when I reinvest the interest so the interest in the next period is earned on the principal sum and the previously accrued interest. That's compound interest, bitch. Uh-huh, way to go. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Previous interest on top of interest, interest... Where is my money! Be careful where you pointin' that gun, man. What's up, Alley? Ooh! Cam! Why the negativity? No! Well, well, if it isn't Cam. The wannabe banger from Compton. You know your boy Pinball over there is in some pretty deep financial shit with me. Lay off, man. Those funds were for all of us in the group. Got this audition tomorrow, see... What I see is that you got money to have a party, but not paying me back the money you owe me in accordance with the frequency computations in our binding contract. You made an investment, and trust me, it's gonna pay off in dividends. You gonna drop some verses on us, Cam? Shut up, Larissa. I used to do your algebra homework for you, girl. - Yeah? I got C's. - Don't be an asshole. Hey! Ooh! Nobody, but nobody disrespects my bitches but me! - Mm-hmm. - Shut up! Now... You're gonna tell me exactly what happened to my money. Before I... Nice snake, Cam. You dirty mother... That was a snake! You know I hate snakes! I be cold-blooded, yo. You gonna be dead blooded in a second is what you're gonna be. You leave that boy alone! - Miss Jones? - Go on! Drop your piece. Miss Jones, you don't have to... You know I care about you, Cam. Fuck you, Alley. Get on outta here, and take your floozies with ya. Go on! Leave Cam be. This isn't over, Cam. - I'll get your money, dog. - Yeah. We got the hookup on a meeting at Uppercase Records tomorrow afternoon. - Yeah. - We get signed. - Yeah. - We be ballin'. - Yeah! - Keep dreaming. 'Cause that old broad? She's not always gonna be there to protect your fucking ass! Watch your language, boy. I'll always be here for him. You know what? I had about enough of him. Take your ass on back to Riverside. Hold me back, I swear. I already called the police. Get on out of here, floozies. Come on, bitch, I mean... ladies. Yeah, come compound that now. - Chill. - Go on! Bitch, move it, move it. - Floozies, go on! - Come on. Damn. Thusela Jones saves the day again. That old gal sure is something. Thanks, Miss Jones. Glad you got my back. Of course, my boy. But your shenanigans is causing me to be late for choir practice. You got some... yayo? - Uh-uh. - Crystal? - Zoom-zoom? - No, I ain't no dealer. I mean, I sold Mucinex to Vurkel one time, but that was in my younger, wilder days. What an ungrateful piece of shit. I just fucking saved your ass, and you can't even hook a sister up? How about an aph? Nah, I'm all right, Miss Jones. All right, I love you. I'll see you later. I'm sure you will. Clear the space, people. Clear the space. Cam, you son of a bitch! We got a new hero in Compton. - My man, Cam. - Shut up, Pin. You need to be a better communicator. Ease Alley Jaw's mind. I know how you are with your phone. My snake! My snake! Has anyone seen my snake? Yeah. This G right here used it to bust up a gun-wielding gangster with your big-ass snake. Yo, sorry I had to resort to violence with your snake, V. It's probably up in a bush somewhere. Yeah, yo mom's bush. Yo, Vurkel, hey, yo mama, man, she is a real skilled gardener! Yeah. Back, sucker, back! Back! Get back! Oh, no, not today. Thusela Jones will meet the Lord on her own terms. Okay, all right. In order to work these streets, you gotta be these streets, huh? You gotta taste these streets. You gotta know what the dealers are selling. - Take it. - I don't know about this, boss. - I said take it. - No, I'm not gonna do it. What are you, a Mormon, huh? Jesus freak? - I'm lactose intolerant, man. - Lactose intolerant. You think that dealers care if you lactose intolerant, huh? - You care if he lactose intolerant? - No, señor. No, señor. Huh? You a goddamn disgrace, rookie. I don't want you as my partner, on the squad, or on the force. You can go back to parking tricycles at Chuck E. Cheese. What's so important about your snake anyway, Vurkel? My invention super charged it with unstable molecules, now it's growing at an uncontrollable rate. And it could get bigger. Big enough to eat a person if the molecules remain unstable. So... what you sayin' is, it's big enough to eat this Twinkie. Dude, that's not a big Twinkie. My Ding Dong is bigger than that. Yeah. All right, everybody, let's help this kid look for his damn snake. Fine, you want me to do it, I'll do it. Gimme. Give it. My ninja. That's how it's done, son. Oh, betrayed by your virgin gag reflexes. Let me get in on that shit. That's that good shit. Real cops don't spit. Swallow that shit down. Swallow it. There. Oh, sweet. Guys, guys! Alley Jaws' AK. Don't I look just like street, hip-hop, gangster, OG, indica, like... Girl, do you even know what you're sayin'? Yeah, I'm just trying to, you know, like, represent. I'm just trying to represent. Pinche cabrón. - Partner! - Hmm? Crime in progress? Well, I'll be. Little white girl with an AK. How cute. Finish your damn ice cream. Don't be playing. Give me that. It ain't a toy. Come on, man. Too much been goin' on today already, aright? Crime in progress! Crime in progress! Get the car, rookie. Hey! You forgot your ice cream! All right, drop the gun, son. Drop the gun, son. - Easy, easy, easy, drop the gun, son. - It's not mine, man. - Aright, aright. - I understand. I understand. Get your stupid ass on the ground. Down quick, like your mama on Tuesday. Get down. Look that way. Look that way. Aright, aright. I told you, man, the gun ain't mine. Possession of a stolen firearm, huh? You going down to the booty house. All right, go ahead and book him, rookie. Oh, ooh, ooh, ooh, uh... How does one book, exactly? It's your training day, I get it. Daddy gotta do everything. Put your hands behind your back. You can't arrest Cam! We got the biggest gig of our lives tomorrow. You think I care about you kids and your crunk dub-step Bieber-believer bullshit? And if I had a dime for every Compton rapper I arrested, I... I would have a whole lot of dimes! Man, come on. Fame and fortune are for the weak-minded. You wanna be powerful? You want real power, huh? You'll be a crooked cop like me. - What? - Crooked cop like me... No, no, no, regular cop. A regular cop... A super, upstanding cop cop. - Super up... - You know what? Never mind. Y'all are really starting to piss me off. Now get this trash off this little white girl's lawn. Hey, yo, Cam is innocent. He was protecting us. How about you do your jobs for a change? Man, shut your mouth, girl, before you get locked up too, man. - Quiet! - Just shut up. I decide who's innocent. - That's good. - Ain't that right, Poindexter? - Me? - Yeah. Oh, affirmative. Cam's guilty. - What? - What you? He used my mutated snake as a weapon, and now it's disappeared. Ah, you see how that goes? You got... a mutated snake? I invented a centrifugal field generator that supercharged it with unstable molecules... Cam! Yo, we're straight up boned, Beez. Yo, yo, yo, why don't we just bail out Cam? Oh, yeah? And with what money? You used it all at the studio makin' those stupid beats. Download next time, stupid. Oh, my beats are stupid? She said my beats are stupid. - She said my beats, my beats... - Dumb. Idiotic. My beats, my beats are stupid? - Retarded. - Oh, really? - Not understanding me? - Well, my bad. Sorry if I wanted to make sure the bass frequencies were bangin'! Why don't you just bail out Cam? With the little money I make I earn the hard way by putting in work. So until you can prove to me that this rap shit will work, I'm out. Yo, R.E.L.s, can you drop me off at the club? Yeah, sister, I got your back. Yo! I did not get you that audition at Uppercase just because I wanted to get shwerp figgety on your snobelisk. I got it for you because you and your crew, you got something real special. I sure as hell hope you got some money left over from Alley Jaws. At least enough to bail Cam out by 3 p.m. tomorrow. Yo, R.E.L.s, I'm a be late! Yeah, yo, I'm coming. Get your shit together. Menorah out. F that noise! We gonna bailout Cam, and we gonna rock this audition! All right, well, how are we gonna come up with this cash, man? ♪ Four, three, two, one ♪ Yo, man, I don't, I don't know about this, Pin. Like, this is not something that Cam would approve of, man. Cam ain't here! Let's go. ♪ Damn, girl, Your legs don't feel Like hot dogs ♪ Hey, man. Thanks for doing the begging today. People are intolerant. We gotta stick together. Society's turned a blind eye. That's why we gotta keep ours open, keep our butts safe. You know what they say, open eyes, open hearts, open butts. Ain't that the truth? Say, friend, do you have any narcotics? Of course I do. It's why I'm homeless in the first place. - Yeah. - Addiction is ruining my life. Ha. Oh, this is my jam! Turn that up. Well, I'm getting tired. I'm gonna go hit the sack. And I mean the literal sack that I sleep in on the ground. You know, and I'll do the same in a few. First, I gotta go defecate in public since restrooms are for customers only. Not sure why anyone tries to read arousing material while attempting a bowel movement. It's weird. I'm still doing it, though. Oh, God! Get the hell out of my tent, you homeless piece of shit. Help me. Uppercase Records sports some of the loudest sound systems available in all of Los Angeles, but the recent rooftop parties have left some local residents less than impressed. Sir, what are your thoughts on the noise? This is a stick-up, sucker! So stay cool! - Damn! - Jesus! I am staying cool. Oh, you want to rob me? Don't be pussies. You better fucking rob me! - Drop your weapon! - Only after you shoot me. None of the other robbers had the balls to shoot me! What's wrong with you, old man? This is not how it's supposed to go. What's wrong with me? What's wrong with you? You didn't even ask about the cash in the ATM! Or the money in the safe in back! We're supposed to ask those questions? Shoot me! Shoot me! You, oh! You wimpy girly man. You threw your gun at me? I didn't have any bullets, that's the thing. You, shoot out the security camera. And we can talk. Yeah, I... I also forgot to load my gun. So dumb. He's shooting! Good job, my friends. So I recently took out a large theft insurance policy. You will be providing my worthless kids with a better future. Oh, and here's a crowbar for the ATM machine. I thought you were takin' us downtown, yo. Why we back here? Because, huh? I got a very important lesson to teach my rookie partner here, huh? It's his first day on the job. Yeah. And it's my training day, too. Yeah, you told me what today is, yo. Could y'all hurry the hell up and book us, or whatever? I'm tired of breathin' Vurkel's farts. It's not me. I know your scent, Geordi La Forge. Don't play that silent but deadly shit with me. Triflin', man, damn. So what's the lesson, boss? Shh. There's a lot of homeless people, hang out around this spot. Oh, yeah, easy targets. Oh, look at you. I underestimated you, son. You're not as stupid as you look. There still might be some hope for you. So here's the thing, if you want to learn to hassle people like a real cop, huh? You gotta start at the bottom. So get your nightstick out. These people will take all kinds of abuse. Looks like somebody already beat us to it. Is this the work of some sick psycho-killer? - Are we going to investigate? - Man, hell, no! Nobody cares about a bunch of mutilated bums. And you can write that down. This city ain't capable of handling this many leeches. How many leeches, exactly, can the city handle, though? I will drag your ass up and down the street by your baby nuts. Anyway, I say we forget all this nonsense, go raid one of those Asian massage parlors, get our almonds milked. Almonds milked. But first, I need a Slurpee. Slurpee. We going downtown yet? I ain't got all day. Going to the convenience store. It's hot. Keep your mouth shut, you might get a Slurpee. - What was that? - I ain't hit shit. Let's roll. It might sting. I'm sorry I threw my plastic piece at you, Yoon. From the back, you dummy. Do I have to do everything? If you guys were hardcore street motherfuckers, you'd put an end to my miserable life. Then I wouldn't have to deal with my bitch of a wife. And shitty kids. Can't even play video games themselves. They have to watch others do it on fucking YouTube. Look, man, you don't gotta give us all the cash. - Save some for yourself. - Yeah, man. Buy your wife something really nice. You don't even know my wife. Her unibrow is so thick that her forehead looks like a... caterpillar is fucking her eyebrows. This mofo right here is gangsta. Oh, it's on. Quick, go out the back door. I don't know anything! Back. - Oh, my God. - Go, go, go, go! - Run! Pick up your feet. - Go, go, go, go. - Shit. - Go faster. Sir, do you speak English? - Run, run. - Oh, shit! What the fuck? Don't worry, I'll call the paramedics. No, just let me bleed out. Drop your weapons, pooh butts, huh? Y'all forget something? Listen, cop, there's somethin' out there. There's something in here. I'm your worst nightmare. - But it's a giant snake, yo! - A big snake. I eat snakes. They call me Mongoose Mike. You crazy! The snake out there, it's huge. It wants to bite us. It wants to bite... I want to bite you, huh? I'm a wolf. In order to protect the flock, you gotta be a wolf. It takes a wolf to catch a wolf. And what I'm gonna do is, I'm gonna skin you, huh? And I'm gonna wear you like sheep's clothing. I'm gonna be in disguise. What? Come on. Get your dumb asses over here. Come on. Come on! This is taking too long, man. I'm ready to go, man. Holy Mary J. Blige. My big beautiful snake! - What the hell? - Although she does look a little bit off. - You think? - Yeah. I think she remembers me. I think she remembers me. Snakes can detect scents and odors over great distances, and most people don't know this, but I know... Oh! No, no, no! I got you. - No! Oh, hell no! - My baby. My baby. I love you. Oh, baby... Well, I'll be... A 2754-B. There's a code for a giant snake eating a person? Specifies a reptile. Not necessarily a snake. Okay, snake, drop the nerd, unless this anaconda wants some. Oh, God! Wee! Ow. Dumb animal. Oh, shit. Fuck the police! You. Yo, I think we're free to go. Welcome to the booty house. Shit. I've gotta get in there. Did you guys see my snake? Get your mutagen hands off me. That thing tried to eat you. Slippery when wet. You gotta help capture it so I can run more tests. You are Franken-crazy! Yo, man, your lust for knowledge has apparently driven you mad, man. Aha! Put your hands in the air like you just don't care, now! All right, now, get over there. Where? This way? No, not over there. Over there. Oh, no, no. What you all waitin' on? Get in, come on, let's go. Go, go, go, go. Come on, man. - Get in. - Let's get outta here, man. Hey, hey. Fuck yeah, sucker! Oh, my snake. My beautiful snake. Where are you? Damn it. They got away. - I'll radio for help. - No, negative, rookie, huh? - This stays between us. - You got it. - All right? - Mm-hmm. I'm not gonna look like some fool who let a couple of pooh-butt asses steal his car. - No. - No. Maybe... This is what I need. Goddamn litterbug. Pick that shit up. May have gotten down into the plumbing after it broke one of the toilets back there. Yo, why we stoppin', C? - We gotta turn around. - Turn around for what? Hit us with them thoughts, homie. What are you talking about? I'm the reason that snake got away. We gotta go back and stop it. Yo, we did not set you out of jail to get eaten by no giant snake! Man, first off, you didn't bust me out. I got myself out. And second, I'm not even gone five minutes and y'all thuggin'? Knockin' over convenience stores? We didn't even have any real guns. We wasn't gonna hurt nobody. We were just playin'. The cops, they have real guns, and real training. Let them deal with the snake! See us, we rappers. We need to get ready for our audition tomorrow. Look, Cam, man, homie has a point, man. I would prefer to not get eaten by a giant snake. - So, what we gonna do, Cam? - What we gonna do, Cam? What we gonna do? Now? We're gonna go get our girl Neon. We got an audition. - All right? - That's what I'm talking about, man. - Whoa. - Yeah. Your training day turning into a real shit show, ain't it, rookie? Yeah, first I lost my gun, and then they showed me their buttocks. Yeah, never mind all that. We got bigger fish to fry. We catch this snake, and I'll be famous, huh? We talkin' about the cover of Time magazine, maybe even YouTube. So the snake is stuck down in the toilet hole. So what I need you to do is take your shrimpy little girl hands, stick it down the drain, and just... pull the snake out. - Down the drain? - Mm-hmm. But poo poo goes down there. And so will your job if you don't get down there like a good little rookie and pull out that goddamn snake! Can you... Get down there! Get elbow deep in those pipes, Mario. - Okay. - You feel anything? No, no. I think... So you got it? I got it, I got it. Whatever you do, you treat it like your first piece of pussy, and you never let it go. You hold onto that snake! Come on! Come on, rook! I think that's all of it. Come on, man! This shit just got personal. Oh, God. I lost my watch! Experiment backfired. Infected by snake saliva. Human DNA molecules are broken down by unstable reptilian molecules. Let's make an antidote. Cam, I thought you were in jail. - Early release. - Then why'd you come in here? Look, you know I don't like you comin' in my place of work. - Now, you need to... - Neon, we need you to come with us. You need to get out of here right now. - Neon. - Oh, hell no. You mofos have a lot of nerve showing your asses in here. Your dough. As promised. We appreciate the loan, but she's comin' with us. I already paid for my full half hour. I ain't taking no for an answer. She's done with you. - Yeah, come on. - Fuck you, Cam, this is my job. We sign to Uppercase tomorrow, you won't have to do this no more. That's hella rich, homeboy. Hella rich. Well, since you killed my boner, why don't we settle this right here, right now. There's nothin' to settle. I just came to get my girl. I'm not your girl, remember? She's my girl, like a homegirl. You know what I mean. She's a key part of the crew. If you are such a goddamn artist, why don't you bust a rhyme right now? You? - No, you. - You? - You. You. - You? You standin' right here in this very spot in this strip club, steppin' to me? Any moron can bust a rhyme, right? Oh! - Okay, we doing it? - Mm-hmm. - We doin' it right. - We're doing it now. - Let's get it. - Get the fuck out of my way. All right, you people. Yo, yo, yo, yo!

Nah, you got pranked. It's a dream sequence, man. So what are y'all saying? I prefer my dream sequences to involve flying. Or banging my old babysitter, Stephanie, on the couch, floatin' in a giant bowl of macaroni and cheese. You must persevere, my son. Go to the audition. Let the world see your talent. That's what I did. Look where it got me. I sold more albums than anybody while I was dead. I mean, I'm still alive. Easy for you to say, Pac. You're not the one that's got some dumbass snake messin' up your every move. Forget that snake. It's not your problem. Rutherford B. Hayes, 19th President of the United States? Man, this doesn't make any sense. What are y'all telling me to do? You're gonna have to make a choice. Your fate is intertwined with the snake. Like two snakes. Your mind is struggling with choices, Cam. You've got another mission to fulfill with your rap crew. Come on, Cam. Go to the audition! Aright, this shit doesn't make any sense. It was all a dream. Charlotte Bronte, author of Jane Eyre. - Cam, come on, Cam. - Rutherford B. Hayes! - He's come to. - Cam! What... what happened? Dude... you got knocked the friggity jiggity out! - What? - Come on, let's get you inside. - Can you stand up? - Of course I can stand up. - Come on. - We got you. Oh, yeah. Come on. Not thessse people. They're so unsssivilized. Tonight has been caca goo-goo! There is a snake terrorizing Compton! Swallowing up people! And it squeezed titty juice on my face. Titty juice! How are we gonna take care of this snake? Perhaps I can stop it. Vurkel? What the hell happened to you? I was infected by the snake. I created an antidote that neutralizes the unstable reptilian molecules, but I only could synthesize enough for one large dose. I could use it to cure myself, or I can use it to destroy the snake. Then make some more, Brainiac! You're not lissstening to me. The specific set of circumstances that caused this mutation in the first place were so random that recreating the same concoction could take months. You gotta make this right. You made the snake, it's your responsibility to get rid of it. Nah, man, we gotta help. And you are in no position to do anything. - I'm good, man, I'm good. - Just relax. I'm cool. We're tore up, honey. Can't you just bring it to the cops? The copsss, yes. Just be careful, Vurkel. You're really... special to me. Don't worry about me, Neon. I know exsssactly who to take it to. Well, well, well. Look who decided to turn himself in. I know how to ssstop the sssnake. If you inject the serum directly into the snake's heart, it should neutralize the unstable molecules that made it grow. Okay, son, calm down. Go ahead and pat yourself on the scales, Egon Spengler, because you made the right decision coming here. And I'll always, always reward those who make the right decision. - Holy shit! - Shut up, rookie. He was a violent offender that already escaped custody once. We gotta do this together. You know the department would just bone this up. So grab that syringe of mutagen. What are we gonna do? We're gonna get that snake outta Compton. Okay, let's roll. Hey, clean up that shit in the interrogation room. I had to ice a violent suspect back there. Pow! We out, bitches! Huh? Gotta go solve a particular ongoin' investigation. Don't we have a lot of paperwork to do? I mean, he was unarmed and all, and you kind of discharged your weapon. Rookie, if we had to fill out paperwork every time we shot an unarmed black man, we would never get to have any fun around here. Right, guys? But, what about the security camera footage in the interrogation room? I mean, it clearly shows you... Goddamn rookies, huh? Am I right? Listen up, fellas. You might see some video evidence, huh? But don't believe the camera. He went for my gun. Wow. Being a cop is awesome! Come on, dumbass. We got a snake to go get got. I can't wait for the day cops start cleaning up after their own fucking murders. Betrayed! Nope. But you're a hero to me. You're really... special. Neon. What an asshole. - Hold on. - Really? All right, there we go, there we go. Look, put your hat on and nobody will even notice. Thanks, girl. I'm feeling better, but... I don't need you to be there for me. I know you don't, but I like to. Makes me feel all motherly or somethin'. Those boys might need mothering, but not me. I'm a grown-ass man. Why you gotta act so hard all the time, Cam? Growing up in these streets, there... there ain't no time to be soft. When things get tough, a man's gotta walk hard. Hmm. Well... I'm about to make things real tough. So I can see just how hard you can get. But there's a snake outside. Oh, and there's a snake in here. And we got that audition tomorrow. We should rehearse. Oh, I'm done rehearsin'. ♪ I'm surrounded By these people ♪ ♪ But I feel like I'm alone ♪ ♪ What there is All that is stylin' ♪ ♪ If I never let it show ♪ Betrayed. Betrayed! - What was that? - I don't hear anything. Girl, you deaf? Most def. Oh, yes, bitch! Oh! Get your stinkin' friggity diggity ass off of my couch! Damn! Everybody gettin' their freak on but me! Lie to me. What in the name of ODB? Vurkel, what the hell are you doing? Goddamn it, Vurkel. For Christ's sake, use a condom. You said I was a hero. That I was special. Vurkel, you are special to me, but this is getting out of hand! I'll show you what is out of hand. Let her go, you freak! What, you think you can take me? Cam, it's the snake. My snake would never harm me. Let's hope you right. Now, what did you do with your mutagen? Those crooked cops. They stole my serum. Okay. So here's the plan. We know the snake is attracted to bass, huh? And we know that Uppercase Records has the biggest sound system in Los Angeles for their private rooftop demos. So what we're gonna do is draw that big black bitch on top of the roof, and blow her big ass up. And then, I'm gonna get all the press, I'm talking about all of it, and all the promotions. Uh, shouldn't we call for backup, though? Ain't nothing but shit between your ears, son, huh? - Get in there. - Let's go. Come on, man. - Stay here and shut up. - What? - Damn. - Stop hissin'. We gotta get to the police station. Bus driver, put this thing on OJ Simpson white Bronco speed and get us the hell outta here! Now, why, I... Oh, holy shit. What the fuck? All right, time to get out of here. Pedal to the metal, let's go. - Man, just stay here. - Shut up. - I'll get my revenge. - That's enough. - Hey, tie him up. - Tie him up? Tie him up with what? Use Beez Neez's belt. Yo, Cam, my trousers gonna drop if you use my belt. Come on, man, can't this stupid bus go any faster? Don't wanna touch him. Why don't you be the first bus that doesn't cause traffic and get this bitch moving! This is the power of Christ compels you. The power of Christ compels you. You know what? The LADOT doesn't pay me nearly enough for this shit! You deal with the giant fucking snake, how about that? Fine. Finally. Oh, my God! Hit the gas, Neon. Oh, shit. Sorry! Oh, dude, it's on us! It's on top of us, what are we gonna do? Faster, Neon, come on! Punch that shit! Cam, Cam, the bridge is out! What are we gonna do, Cam? - I got some plans, yo. - What's the plan? We jumpin' the gap. That's the plan? Oh, shit! We can do this. Trousers be damned! Vurkel, come on! He don't wanna go. Let's go. - Go. - Come on! Shit. Oh, my God, we made it. Yes! - I still have my legs. - Yeah, baby! - Oh, yeah. - We did that. Yeah! Yeah! Suck on these balls, snake. - Yeah. - Yeah! Oh, Beez Neez, nice underwear, man. - Oh, shit. - Yo, yo, yo. Yo, we left Vurkel on the bus. - Yeah. - 'Cause his face turned into a snake. Yo. Yo! Yo! Y'all can't be comin' up here without a warrant. Boss! These assholes, they be trippin'! Cut the hood act, white girl. We got business. Okay, all right. Anybody not looking to get tossed off the roof head first best exit directly. Excuse me. Who the hell do you think you are? This is my building. I'll have you arrested. I know all the cops. - I know the best cops. - Yeah. - I am the best cop. - Oh, yeah? - Dumbass. - Dumbass. Now, I don't have time for your shit, so you best exit directly, or get dumped on your head. - Yeah, yeah! - No? Oh, God! What do I pay you for? What are you, nuts? I'm not gonna hit a cop. Get this piece of shit out of here. On yo head! - Okay, rookie. - Yeah? - Get on the turntables, all right? - Okay. Then what we gotta do is we gotta get that giant snake up here so I can inject this into his dumbass heart, all right? Now, here's the whole plan. Get your ass back over here. Here's the whole plan in detail. - Now, feast, my pet. - Get your damn snake, Vurkel. - What the... - Oh, my God. - No way. - Oh, okay. Now what do we do, Cam? Now you'll all bow down to my superior genes! Hey, maybe he's gonna bang that snake again and not eat us, right? You all made fun of me. And you, you played with my heart. - Me? What? - You shall suffer most of all. Hey, wait, hey, snake. No. Hey, snake, no! Listen to me! Listen to me. Listen to me. Well, I mean, the situation is improving. Albeit by convenient means. Oh, it is me. - Oh, excuse me one second. - You gonna answer it? - Yeah, excuse me. - Who could you possibly... ♪ Hello? Is it me you're looking for? ♪ Listen, there are those crooked 5-0 up here. Yeah, you know, the ones that arrested Cam? Yeah, they're yellin' about some snake or something. The roof? They're on the roof? - Who's up on the roof? - The crooked cops. They on the roof of the record company. Ask if they got that vial of anti-mutagen with them. All right, baby, do they have the big syringe? Yeah, no, I see it. It's got like glowin' blue shit in there. All of it? All right, tell her to lay low and wait for the cavalry. We en route. All right, look, baby, I don't want you to get hurt. Lay low, as low as you can go. Man, just tell her what I said and let's go. Just be careful, we're on our way. Aright, we goin', come on. Bitch, didn't I tell you to get off the roof? Oh, you running now, huh? I thought you was street, baby. This is how we play. Huh? I'm a wolf! Keep playing the music, rookie. Oh, uh, sorry. I'm gonna deal with little Miss Anne Funk over here. - Anne Funk? - Yeah, it's like a Jewish... you know, like Anne Frank, right? Except like some urban shit, like a urban twist to it. Like, you know, is it too soon? You know what? You just keep playing the music, and I'm gonna deal with her, all right? Your hood rat ass really gonna make me climb this damn ladder and shit? No, no, I'm not a hood rat. I'm a phony. See? I'm a scared white girl. I'm very confused. Hey, partner? I think something's happening down on the street. I got it. Snake, this is fucking crazy! Don't mind me. What are you doing? You don't need that sound anymore. You've got me! All right, rookie. Get ready to see some shit. Oh, my God! Game over, man. Game over! Once I inject this syringe into this snake's dumbass heart, - then it's game over. - Maybe she's right! You know, about the game being over? No, negative, rookie. It's time to pump up the jam. Th-That's this one. Oh, wait, wait, listen, kid. Just leave your mix tape with me. - Carl, send backup! - Thank your mama. HQ, there are some fucking civilians on the rooftop, over.

Say it to my face. Say that to my face. I'm sorry about your girls, but Pinball didn't mean any disrespect. Peace to your girls. They really had what it took. - Really? - Yeah. Oh, my God, I appreciate that so much. You have no idea what I go through. I'm just a shadow of myself. I'm a lie! My daddy, you don't know my daddy. I'd love to hear more about it, but we don't have the time. - We got to roll. - But I... But hey, to be continued, though. Tell you what, Cam. Show us what you can do, dog. - Show us what you can do. - All right y'all, come on, man. Let's go. - Hey, stop, freeze right there! - Oh, hey. Yeah!
