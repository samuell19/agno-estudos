ALLUDA MAJAKA [temple bell ringing] Those who believe Lord Rama will never get disappointed. Our Seetharam will definitely get justice. What justice? They say he would be hanged tomorrow. When asked about his last wish before getting hanged... It seems he made a wish to visit our village's Lord Rama's temple. It is unbelievable that such a good man killed an S.I. WELCOME SEETHANAGARAM THANK YOU SEETHARAMAPURAM Seetharam is coming... Seetharam is coming... Seetharam is coming... [indistinct voices] [indistinct voices] [tires screeching] Hey! Move away... Move away, Move away! [doors open] Hey! Move... [bird chirping] Move! [temple bell rings] [indistinct voices] Ram! What is this? What is this ill fate? Why is this injustice being done to you? Hey! What is this? Tata Rao! I have a simple request! We were celebrating Lord Rama's birthday grandly every year. It must be celebrated in the similar manner in the future too. Ensure that he is adequately looked after. What for? It is because he has taken good care of you? Is it for taking you away from us? Or is it for sentencing you to gallows unjustly? Why should we take good care of Lord Rama? What good has he done to us to take good care of him? Don't feel sad, Tata Rao! Whatever Lord Rama does, is for our good. - Rama... - Time is up! I'll leave! [infant crying] WELCOME TO SEEThANAGARAM [wedding percussions] [pistol fires] [glass breaks] [horse neighs] [horse neighs] [tires screeching] [chaos] [wedding percussions] Madam Vasundhara, please bring the bride and make her sit here. [chants] [chaos] [chaos] Hey! Sir, Lawyer Sivaramakrishna is here. - Hello sir. - Hello. I want to talk to him personally. [pistol fires] [pistol fires] Who are you? Why did you want to kill me? To save your life! If I had not shot at you... You would have been hanged by this time. Till this wound heals, your sentence cannot be executed. Why do you want to save my life? Thoughyou knew you would be hanged, I want to know, why you forcibly married a girl? Tell me, did you love that girl? Or was it vengeance? Why did you marry her? Hey, Soumeshwar Rao priest is asking coconuts, bring a 100 of them. - Abbulu! - Yes? It's getting late for the wedding. Prepare the Paanakam (Jaggery Beverage) quickly. Sir, it is the last one. It is almost ready. I will beat you up! Is this the last one? It's not enough for people visiting from the surrounding villages. - Prepare a few more vessels. - Okay sir. Prepare ten more vessels of soaked split black gram. Okay. Sir... Please taste this. - Not really sweet. - Oh... - Add a chunk of jaggery to it. - Yes sir. - Girls: Ramudu... - Mumbles. - Hey, Abbulu! - Yes sir! Sooramma's daughter Padma, Rathnamma's daughter Manga are ogling at me. What is their intention? The face looks so good, it's the same problem I face everywhere. Women just fall head over heels for me, I'm unable to answer everyone. - Why are you staring at me? - Your face looks so good ain't it? You have misunderstood! I did not say about my face. About your face, sir! If I bash you up! You will end up in a heap of trash. - Mind your business. - Okay. - Girls: Ramudu... - Mumbles. Do you have any work with me? [girls spit] No one noticed. - Brother! - Yes dear? This are lord's bridal dress. Father asked you to give these to the priest. Where is father? Every year, we are doing some good social service on Sri Rama Navami (festival). Last year, we built a temple in the Harijanawada. A year before that, we dug up few lakes. A year before that we laid new roads and built a library in our village. Then, this year's total revenue of Temple is Rs 4 lakhs. It will be good if you people suggest an idea for it's use. What can we suggest sir? You are our village head. Whatever you do, you always do for our good. You suggest us the right thing. We have got ourselves everything for our village. I have run out of ideas. Father, we will do something which will make our village all India famous. What is it? Isn't there 500 acres of Temple's land? If we give each farm worker in our village an acre of land... There will not be any farm worker left in our village. Everyone would become a farmer. Excellent! Good! It is very good. Listen Mr. President! If you want applause and felicitation for your son, by donation. Donate your own land holdings and property. But, you can't donate temple's land. Who are you to question this? That land belongs to president's ancestors. So... For cheap publicity, will they take back land donated to temple? Who will take care of running temple's administration? Who will bear the expenses of Lord Rama's marriage? Look brother, this year Lord's lands had fetched Rs 4 lakhs as income. We will deposit that amount in bank. Bank will pay us interest. With that interest we will celebrate Lord Rama's marriage every year grandly. Come on, you tell him man. That is enough! You will celebrate marriage with interest money. Who will white wash the temple, pay salary to the priest, buy oil for lamps? Is it a problem? If each house donates Rs 100 we will have plenty of funds. Very simple. What is this nasty deed of usurping temple's land and then donating. We will not allow even a cent of land of temple to be donated. How will it be if we do something? Without applying scent of fragrance, Why not donate just the land? - Hey! - Hey! You will pay up for it! That is it! This is not a place for battle of Rama and Ravana. But Lord Rama and Seetha's marriage. If you want god's offerings sit here patiently. Else tell us... They will bash you up! You will end up in a heap! Why do we stay here getting insulted nastily? Come, let us go. You are the nastiness of the village. Just to avoid seeing you, I am wearing the imported black goggles. - What do you say? - Why bother about them? Mr. President, do as you wish. Though, I am a President of this village for 30 years, I am very proud that my son got an idea which I could not in all these years. As said by my son, I am donating all the temple's land to farm workers. "Our village deity, our handsome Rama." "Sree Rama is the god for mother Seeta." "Our village deity, our handsome Rama."

He said if you use this oil, hairs will grow thick and blacken with shine. Believing it is true, I used it just only once. I have lost so much of my hair. Brother, I am fearing that I will lose all my hair and become a skin head. Who is that guy, who sold you this oil? Provision Stores Kittaiah! Hey! Kitti! Were you the one, who sold this oil bottle to my sister? It is me! Did you tell her that her hair will grow fast if she uses it? I did... Will you sell spurious goods to girls? Please, do not beat me! If you want I will compensate the loss. Then, give! What do you want me to give? Eye for an eye... Life for a life... Blood for blood! Hair for hair... Get up! You must be a skin head all your life. If I see a hair grow on this head... I will break open your head. Love on your sister has affected my head! Get down lady. Get down sir, get down. Get down... Excuse me! Get down... We have reached your village. This is not the place where we have to get down. Go straight to my uncle's house! This is a public transport bus! Not a corporation lorry to stop at every home. This is the last stop. Please, get down. If we refuse to get down... We have to force you to get down. [bashing sounds] Oh God... Oh! My god! Right, right... [tires screeching] [sheep bleat] [tires screeching] [hens cluck] [tires screeching] [screaming loud] When they have introduced a bus route to our house? Why have you nastily come in a bus? We did not come in a bus, we drove the bus. Why have you come in a bus? What happened to your car? Uncle, car broke down and stopped on way! - Then, where is sister? - Here. Not your sister! My sister. Mother said she will come after getting the car repaired. We came happily in a bus. Uncle, when an old man came on to the middle of the road... Sister knocked him down with the bus. Don't know what happened to the poor man? Lost limbs or dead? He broke his legs, so you both are alive. Otherwise, I would have arranged for your coffin. Are you talking knowing who they are? I don't care whoever they may be. Roadside Rosy and homeless Halley. They have unjustly broke that old man's legs. They have to answer the village committee. Come for village committee's enquiry. Village committee? What does it mean? Border of my dhoti! Seetharam, are dare take my nieces to the village committee? Nieces or whoever it may be! When anyone commits a mistake he must come to the village committee. - Come! - See mister! I think you don't know about us sisters. Do you have anything extra! No sir, they both are super brats, don't get into trouble with them. - What will happen, if I do? - We will kill them! What you will kill? A mosquito. Don't act smart... Come with me. If we refuse to come? I'll drag you there. Come do it, let me see it! Hey! Seetaram... If you put a step further I will break open your head. Come! When he is beating me and going away? Why are you all watching fun? Let him go, sir! His sins will punish him. Shut up, silly idiot. Don't know what he will do with them, taking there? Come, let us go bring my sister. - Mommy... - Hey! If you move you will lose your legs, stand there. Who is that? Who is that man who brought my daughters here? It is me! How proud you are? Will you talk disrespectfully to me? Why should I respect you? Are you addressing me cheaply? When you can address me cheaply can I not? You shut up! Whatever it may be cry it in Telugu! Everyone here will understand your agony! Do you know with whom you are talking? I know... You are the mother brat of these super brats! What did you say? Stop! Don't raise your hands in emotion! Our Big Boss has great mass following. He will show the magic of his hands! Look, Mrs. Vasudhara! You are also committing a crime by supporting your daughter's crime. If they've done a crime, report it to the police or approach the court! This is the court or police station for this village. Anyone committing a crime must get punished here only! Father, you deliver the judgement. Look, what you have done for fun a man has become handicapped. What do you want us to do? Do you want us to repent and do sit ups? He will ask you both to jump into a drain canal along with your mother. You keep shut and hear him. Sir, you carry on... Go on... The old man whose leg you broke, has four people depending on him. Since he has become a handicapped now, their family has lost a bread winner. So, as a recompensation, pay him Rs 50.000 cash or... Give him an acre of land. If we refuse to do it... You may have to buy wheel chairs for your daughters. So, would you break their legs nastily? We will break their hands too nastily! Why mess up with them, throw a 50,000 rupees to them. Psst psst... I told you to pay the money, not to throw at me. Pick the money and give it respectfully to the old man's wife. Excellent! Now, it looks good. - Come, let us go! - Go. What is his status compared to your status? He doesn't even equal the a hair on your head... How dare he insults you publicly? How did he get that courage? Because he is popular with the masses! And his father is village committee's president. What's great about his president's post? If sister shifts from city to here. She can make him to resign as president in 3 days. If we just show her face, people will just cast their votes to her. Shut up! You did not dare to open your mouth there. Here you are boasting that you will make as this village president. Idiots! I thought they will do something and kept quiet otherwise... You are too much sir! I thought she will wink at me so that I can go and bash him up. She did not wink at me I did not go and beat him. Still the situation has not worsened sister. You just say yes, I will blow him out. Madam, please say yes! [bamboo sticks tocking] [cow bells ring] [cow bells ring] [cow bells ring] [cow bells ring] [cow bells ring] [whiplash] What is this man? You said while going you will blow him but falling like this. Our people's blow was little feeble and his blows was little stronger. Sister... I had to get myself blown up by him. He will blow... He will definitely blow, that is why I did not join you. Are not you all men? We are men! But he turned out to be a real man. There came the difference. Are not you ashamed to say that, idiot? Why should he feel ashamed? Though alone that Seetharam bashed up 10 of our people. That Seetharam must feel ashamed. If you shake him up in the first scene itself. Hero may not be there till climax so... Your brother may have hesitated a little. Is not it? Damn! Shut up, you fool! Sister! Say yes, once more! This time I will get few rowdies from city. I will blow him up before the interval itself. I am not going to say yes this time, shut up. In 2 days, groom's people are coming to see Pappi. Let me finish that first then, we will take care of him. Whatever it may be it must be seen today itself. What are you going to see madam? His ruination. The people before whom he had embarrassed us. We will embarrass him before the same people. That means you are going to do comedy, nastily! No, we will make his life into a tragedy. Come, Bobby. God! You must only save these brat sisters. Are you sage Gilphonse? A proud man has insulted us. You must teach him a lesson. In which type you want to teach him? Like Devadas went after Parvathi, like Majnu went after Laila. He must go mad for we sisters and come after us all his life. Oh! You mean mad? Easy, dead easy... Pay me Rs 5.000! I will give you an amulet. Not Rs 5.000, I will pay you Rs 10.000, give me powerful amulets. Take these and tie to his loin string. He will be after you mad holding this in his hand for your love. And to marry you with an auspicious thread. Go! Go... "Younger one's saree's a bit shorter." "Elder girl's pallu's a bit longer."

Do you want me to wake you up? You? Why are you here? Where is Seetharam? Look! Here he is! You were here just now! How did you go there? I expected you will do something silly like this. As soon as you went into dreams I made Tata Rao to sleep here and went aside. Tata Rao! Pounce on them. Will you tie me amulet, my dear? I will have you my dear... Amulet has started functioning. If he gets us, we are finished. Mother, what is this saree so cheaply? What is there cheap in wearing a saree? It is cheap only if you do not wear a saree. You shut up! Look dear! For marriage and bride seeing ceremony one must drape only sarees. You must show sister in a Midi or Swimsuit to the coming American boy. If you show her in a saree how can he like her? Not only just the groom, but accompanying elders should also like her, is not it? What is this Pappi? You must not drape a saree up! You must drape it always below your belly button. Madam, I am asking you nastily. Is the groom coming to see her face or her belly button? Idiot! Give me the jewellery. Mother, I cannot bear the weight of all this jewellery. Then, we will put all this jewellery to our maid and make her stand next to her. Shut up! [honks] Wear anyone! They have come. [tires screeching] Come! - Greetings! - Greetings... Greetings madam. She greeted me, not you! Did she greet you? I thought she greeted me, so I greeted her. Madam, cancel my greetings. Sir... You greet her. - Greetings! - Greetings! Come in. She had called me in... Not you! Okay... Let us go! Come! - Sit down. - Me or him? - Both of you sit down. - Then, okay! - What would you like to have? - We will have anything which you may give? - Chalapathi! - Yes, madam. Bring drinks. In the same breath order glasses, ice and chips also. Drinks mean not that drinks... Cool drinks... Cool drinks. Has not your wife come with you? Where does he have a wife? Unable to bear this gentleman's tortures. 10 years ago, she doused herself with 10 ltrs. of kerosene and self immolated. Fool... Fool... Fool... Don't crack nasty jokes. They may think it to be true. - Is not it true? - Look again, joking. Don't take to his words serious. He always plays comedy. My wife died then, with plague. What is this? When they said groom is coming from America. I thought, he will be coming in a suit and will be young. Why is he old like a cattle broker of Peddapuram animal market. Son! Is it second marriage for you? Look, you are not able to differentiate between Akkineni and Mikkilineni. He is not the groom. Nastily, you are not, is not it? I am not the groom, nastily. I am father of the groom. He is my P. A. Then, where is the groom? He went to the next village and said he will be coming with his friend. By this time, he will be on the way. [tires screeching] [groans] Oh god! Sorry... Suddenly on seeing a genuine Telugu girl, I forgot to blow horn. Are you hurt? I think the vessel is hurt. Oh god! It is major accidents only. People at home may scold you. Shall I buy you a new one? Cannot you speak? - No, I cannot! - Okay! Even that is also good. Look, since you are dumb. Since, you cannot scold me, if I say something... I am going to say what's in my heart. I like you very much in the first sight only. If you give my vessel I will go away. Can you speak? No, I am totally dumb. Not only beautiful, she is also clever. What is this? Groom has not come yet. I have come... I have come. I have brought the auspicious threads. I will tie the six knots. Hey! Who are you? What is this Aunty? - Why are you talking against me? - Aunty? It's me! Your both daughters famed husband. Oh my god! Have not you told about the greatness of the amulet to mother-in-law? Hey, Tata Rao. You are blabbering! Have you gone mad? Yes! Your nieces are mad for love. And I am mad for marriage. Everything is the greatness of this amulet. What is all this non-sense? Marriage non-sense. - Chalapathi! - Yes, madam. Why are you standing and walking? I thought you will make a gesture and I will bash him up. Lousy fellow! First throw out this mad man. Mother-in-law! You are insulting a son-in-law, you will pay for this sin. Some madman! Don't take it seriously. Why has not your son come yet? Maybe his car has given trouble in route. Look, Srisailam... Will you go and come? You go and come quickly. - I will manage everything here. - I will beat you with my slipper. It is me who should be here and it is you who should go and check out there. Go! Excuse me! One minute. You did not scold me for spoiling the shape of your vessel. You did not get angry for stopping and talking to you. That means... Do you like me? You are going away silently! That means you like me, is not it? - Sir... Sir! - What? Everyone is waiting there for you to come see the bride. Why are you standing here looking aimlessly? I am not looking aimlessly. I am looking at a bride. What are you saying? I liked that girl! If I ever marry, I will marry only that Malleshwari. Will you marry her? This is on the tip of your son's tongue but I said it. - That is all, is not it? - Yes! Then, tell him, what is on the tip of my tongue? You cannot marry that girl! You must marry only Vasundhara's daughter. Impossible! I will not marry her. That is the result. When I am asking you to get into a flight. Why do you want to get into a rickshaw? You have not seen Vasundhara's daughter. If you see her you will fall head over heels for her. Why don't you tell him? Yes, she is like great Goa beach she will never hide her body. She is very stingy with her clothes. I did not ask you to say that... Tell about her beauty. Elder daughter is Silk Smitha. Younger daughter is Disco Shanthi. Mother is Jyothilakshmi! Even if she is miss India... I will not marry her. I will marry only that Malleshwari whether you agree or refuse. Don't worry son... I am agreeing to your marriage. Who are you to agree? It is me who should agree. If I say something even you will accept. That means! Follow me... In the temple land donated to the farm hands by the president. Crores of worth granite has been found to exist there. No one knows about it. If you accept that girl as your daughter-in-law. That president will became our man. Crores worth temple land will become ones. Oh! My great P.A.. Why did you hide such a good news from me? Without any further delay! Let us get them married. I am very happy, brother-in-law. When such a rich man like you has come forward on your own for my daughter. What better luck can I have than this. The luck is not yours kinsman. It is my luck that you have become my kinsman. What do you say, Srisailam? It was on the tip of my tongue and you have said it. Sir, you have come in hot sun. Have this cool drink. Did you like the groom? If you like him, then I too like him. If you do not mind, I want to ask you a question. - What is that? - You are very rich people. And your son is studying in America. If you want you can get proposals from rich families. And millions as dowry. What is the reason for coming for my sister. Money will come today... Vanish tomorrow. But honour, prestige are immortal. With that reason only he has come with the proposal to you. You may have come for any reason. But I must give dowry according to my status, is not it. - If you make your wish... - Dowry? Come on, get up son! Why are you going away like that? Is he appearing like a poverty stricken man to you? Then, do not you want dowry? I will not accept even a single pie. If you insist on giving! Then, I am going away, immediately. Sir... Please stop. Though you may not like, we are bride's people, we have to give dowry, is not it. Okay! Since you are very eager to give dowry... I will ask and take it later. What do you say, Srisailam? - It was on the tip of my tongue. - And I said it, is not it it? Yeah! Don't know sir, I feel something strange on seeing this Kota Pentaiah's face. Don't know about father, but son's photo's worth framing. Do not rush into the decision. Outside photo is ok but we need an X-ray of inside. That is what we need mainly. Then, let us test him. - Is it urine test or blood test? - Not that. Please come in! Brother-in-law, you may have forgotten about villages after staying in America. - Come, let us go around the village. - Okay! Let us go. You stay here! You are not the one who went to foreign. He is the one. You stay here and give him tips which are on his tongue. You come with us, sir! This is main market centre of our village. - Hey Somaraj. - Yes. Give me a pack of Karim Beedis and horse marked match box. - As you say. - Sir! Which is your brand? Red Wills or Gold flake? - I don't smoke Cigarette's or Beedies. - Then, you will be smoking cigarettes. - Hey Somaraj! Give a Lanka tobacco cigar. - Sir. Our village tobacco cigars are very famous. I don't smoke anything. Sir, he is feeling very shy! No problem, I will not tell this to my sister. Whether you tell your sister or not I am not bothered. I don't smoke. Brother-in-law... Brother-in-law. This is our village's little stream. - Just nearby... - Seetharam? - Yes, I am coming... Coming... - Why is he running away like this? When he sees this group he always runs away. Sir, what are you ogling at? I am looking at the fields! Why are you seeing the fields? Look at the girls. They are very famous girls around this place. They will not refuse anyone when approached. - You idiot! - Sir, why did you slap me? Otherwise, do you find me like a casanova? Brother-in-law! You have passed in our tests... Passed in our tests. Good morning, Mr. Ramachandra! What is the meaning of your stare? Generally, I used to bow with two hands folded together. Are you surprised at seeing me bowing you with just one hand? There is reason for it. My sister's marriage has been fixed. Till now, you were epitome for all good qualities of a husband. Hereafter, you are not just the one man? My brother-in-law has come as a competitor to you. Look, mother Seetha! Your husband did not marry you just like that. He had taken a kingdom as dowry from your father to marry you. My brother-in-law is going to marry my sister without any dowry. Who is great, your husband or my brother-in-law? Mr. Hanumanth! You can get up from that place. You settled here considering lord Rama and Seetha as ideal couple. My sister and brother-in-law have come as competitor to them. So, switching your loyalty to my sister and brother-in-law will be better. Try to understand why I am saying it. Mr. Lakshman! You too! If you come quickly... We can go to Rama studio and get ourselves photographed as a group. Considering you as my boss I went little overboard. Don't take it to heart. I will go Now. Farm workers are doing weeding out work. Did you see? I forgot to say the real thing in my talk. You must look after my sister and brother-in-law nicely. You will, is not it? You will. I know that. Thank you, sir! Lord! Give me a boon to be born in all my births as his sister only. Refusing our Pappi, is he marrying that president's daughter? Yes, sister, they have exchanged symbolic proposals also. Idiot! Will that Kota Pentaiah dare to cheat me? We promised to give him everything he asks for. A napkin to cover the skin head? A pillow to sleep? Is she really a woman? Will she kiss him on the nuptial night if he marries her? Will she caress him? Will she at least give some place to sleep on her bed? She is hot headed to make her husband massage her legs. How can he be happy if he marries her? Ok! Refusing the elder brat and if he goes for the younger brat. She will wink at the priest in marriage. And will call the musician aside. Still considering yours as a good family and adjusts to it. This fellow runs into women like a bull to ruin their chastity. Next, when it comes to your matter... You have taken to streets like a man leaving a husband. Rascal! What did you blabber? Kill him... Kill him. Why have you all joined together and beating me nastily? Otherwise, will you dare to blabber anything you feel like? These words were not mine. What Seetharam and his father said to Kota Pentaiah... I heard it and was repeating it for you. Did they say that? Why? To spoil Pappi's marriage and get their daughter married to him. I will see... I will see that also. What will you see? That girl's marriage? No, their cries. Look, he is coming. With this strike, he must lose his brain and come after us like a madman. Come on... What is this, blue babies? They are running free public shows. Hey, you must not bath in this lake. - We will not bath. - We will swim. This is not a place to swim. It is a drinking water lake. If you are so interested to swim, there is another lake near by, go there. That place will suit your bodies. We will swim here only. Do whatever you wish to do. They are not just ordinary brats. They are super brats. Are you going to come out from it or not? If we refuse to come out... I'll teach you a lesson. Go ahead! Let me see how you do it. City girls! You will not believe in words... I will show you the deed of village power. That is it. - Sister, he is taking my dress away. - He has taken away mine too. What do you think of yourself? That is it. Hey! Mister, are not you ashamed of disrobing a woman? Why should I feel ashamed? You must feel ashamed for bathing in a drinking water lake in a swim suit. Are you going to return our dresses or not? Say sorry, that you will never do such foolish acts again. I will return your clothes. We will not say sorry at any cost. - Hey Abbulu... Go and lift it. - I will lift. Where are you going this side? You asked me to lift, is not it. I thought of lifting them out. - I did not ask you to lift them. - Oh! I meant gates. Oh! The gates, I have understood it. - You are finished. - I will lift them. Water is leaking out. Will you say sorry or get publicly humiliated? We will not say sorry at any cost. Fantastic darling! Stay up on your words. We will see what will happen next. Water level is going down rapidly. Shall we say sorry? How can we say sorry shamelessly? If we wait for one more minute... We may have to die in shame. Yes. Are there any Leeches in the lake? Not just Leeches, there are Snakes also! Don't get up. It seems there are Leeches and Snakes. They may bite us. We will say sorry to them. Look Seetharam! Sorry for getting into the lake. It is not enough if you say it alone. Ask your sister also to say it. Sister! Please say sorry. That is it! Wear it. Close them... Close them. Never again clash with my boss, you will end up cut up to size. In front of the people, you had insulted us. In front of the same people if we don't insult you... We are not brat sisters. Hey, you get lost. No one is there in the house. If there is no one, then who is speaking? It means, my brother and father have gone to Rajamundri. So, I have come in a good time. Why did you come? Should not I come? Why do you treat me as an outsider and make me stand outside? Please come and sit inside. Will not you offer anything to your groom? What will you have? I will have anything you give. Take it. Leave me. If someone sees us, it will not be nice. You only told that there is no one in the house. What is wrong, if they see us? Anyway, we are going to be husband and wife. I am going to America tomorrow. When will you come back? After 4 months. I came to see you to remember you till then. Take the buttermilk. - I don't need buttermilk. - Then, what? - Seetaramudu... - What is it? Leave me. I will leave you only when you forgive me and my sister. What idiotic thing have you done? I mistake that you fixed alliance for your sister with my sister's fiancee. After knowing that it was not your mistake. I have not even had a single cup of coffee also. I will go only when you forgive me. Yes, I have forgiven you. Go... go... Then me and my sister can eat food? You can also eat this hay, if you wish to. Thank you. [indistinct voices] Seetaram! Seetaram... Hey, what happened to you again? The labourers are coming in this direction only. What is bothering you, if they come? If they see me with you near this hay stack... They will mistake me as your lover. It is ok, if they mistake me... Since I am a woman. But you are a bachelor. You will be in trouble. Then, what are you going to do now? I will hide in the hay stack. Make sure that they do not come this way. Buddy... What is this? What is this? You have seen, is not it? I saw you picking up hay with both of my eyes. - You saw me picking up hay. - Yes. Okay. Do you think I am dead? If I am late, will you pick up hay by yourself? What is wrong in it? Okay, don't do such mistakes again in the future. Hey... Hey... Why are you taking that? To feed the calves. I will feed them, you can go. You mean to say that you will pick up and feed the hay yourself. - What is wrong in doing our work? - Sir. If you are angry, you can hit me with your slippers. But don't do such silly things. Hey... I told you that I will feed them, is not it? - You go that side. - Oh! My god! Sir, did you see my sister? She told that she is coming to meet you. [gasps] How did my sister's upper cloth come here? Seetaram... [gasps] Has my sister left? Has the oily face Abbulu and the labourers gone? Thank god! My god! I thought that everyone had gone. Why did not you tell me that they are still here, darling? Darling? How dare you call him, darling? Forgive me, sister. Seetharam and I are in love. It's a lie. He is in love with me, not with you. No, he is in love with me and said that he will marry me only. He had promised me the same in the temple. Taking me in to his lap, he kissed me and said. Seetharam, will you deceive me like this? Seetharam, will you cheat me like this? You are not Seetharam, you are a cheater Ram. You are not lord Ram. You are evil Ravana. Why are you staring at us? Take him to village committee. Yes. Buddy, are they telling the truth? Yes, it's a fact. All these days, we thought that you are a good man. We should not leave you for deceiving the 2 sisters. Yes, he must be punished. Will you agree to whatever punishment we give him? We agree. What do you say? What is left to say? Since their fair name has been spoilt because of me, Because of that, no one will come forward to marry them, I will tie the auspicious threads and take them both as my wives. Stop it. They tied the amulets to me. It is me who should tie the auspicious threads. You can tie in your next birth. Let me tie in this birth. Catch them... "The bird chirps for pairing." "Give her a boquet of kisses." "Pair with her and bring her back to the earth." "Hold her saree." "Pair up with the tender beauties." "Show them a sample of your power." "And the celebration continues..." "Hey! Let's start!" "The bird chirps for pairing." "Give her a boquet of kisses." "The town girls woo with their sharp looks." "Young chaps fall for the external beauty of these girls." "Returning the stares with prowess." "Returning the traps with naughtiness." "Returning the stares with prowess." "Returning the traps with naughtiness." "Gets their love trap in control." "This naughty man teaches them a lesson." "This naughty man." "Hey Rama, we've come here by mistake." "Oh cupid, please leave us." "Would I leave you if you plead me?" "The bird chirps for pairing." "Give her a boquet of kisses." "Can a leaf break a thorn?" "Can a fruit break a mountain?" "Doesn't a snake bite you if you invade it's abode?" "Doesn't butter melt when you heat it?" "I am a village hero, who is quite capable" "I am a village hero, who is quite capable." "I am manly enough and know the ways of girls." "Wouldn't I grant their wishes when the girls surround me!" "Wouldn't I grant their wishes!" "Hey Rama, we plead you." "Oh cupid, please leave us, we've learnt a lesson." "Don't dare come back again." "The bird chirps for pairing." "Give her a boquet of kisses." "Pair up with the tender beauties." "And the celebration continues..." "Hey! Let's start!" The invitation is very good. Thank you very much. Distribute these invitations to your relatives on behalf of us. Okay! Brother-in-law, when you said that you will give dowry to my son... I said that I will ask for it when I need it. Do you remember, brother-in-law? Why not? Please ask whatever you want. I want the temple's farm lands, which you gave away to the farm hands. Your son-in-law wants to build a factory in that 500 acres of land. Please forgive me. I have given that to farm hands. Ask them to give it back. Will they deny, if you ask for it? Though they will not deny it, I cannot take what I had given as charity. If you say so, this marriage will not be conducted. Brother-in-law! If you want to call me like that, you must write the farm land to my son. Brother-in-law, if you want, I will write house and farm land on his name. Who needs your farm land or house? Our Kota agreed to the marriage only because of the temple farm land. - What do you say? - You are right. You had spoken what I thought. Do not stop the marriage for which the invitations had been printed. Consider this as your legs, not your hands. You will not agree to write temple's farm land on my son's name. It is not fair on your part to ask for it. So, it is not fair to conduct the marriage also. Look out for another alliance for your daughter. Greetings, sir. What is it Krishnamurthy? It seems you have fixed the auspicious time for your daughter's marriage. When is it? Sir, I will cut the nails of your daughter during the marriage. Sir, don't tell Surya. Sir, are 25 people enough to carry the bride's dowry? Father, I have given advance to music troupe and Band people. Asking Kanaka Rao to bring the garlands. I have sent our Abbulu to bring crackers. Aunty said, she will go to Rajamundri to buy silk sarees. I asked them to buy it from Kanchipuram. What about dress materials to the groom's people? There is no need. Father, why those tears in your eyes? This year the guard size is good but... Greetings, Mrs. Vasundhara! I was going to your house only. You came across. Why did you come again? To make your daughter as my daughter-in-law. I will hit you with my slippers. The day you refused our proposal and accepted president's daughter. I knew that day itself about your cheap mentality. Didn't I tell you, she will say these words! Come, let us go. Shut up! Idiot! Let bygones be bygones. Forget it as a bad dream. And think that he had dreamt it. It seems coming 23rd is an auspicious day. If you say yes, I will fix the marriage. What do you say, Srisailam? It was on the tip of my tongue and you said it. Then, what about Seetharam's sister? We had little differences in dowry and dropped it. Means? So, you have come thinking, you will get more dowry here. It was on the tip of my tongue, you said it. What is guarantee that you will not go elsewhere, if you get still more. - No... No guarantee, what do you say sir? - Shut up man! Look, I and president may have many problems between us. But I don't have a wish to spoil her marriage. With my daughter's marriage. President's daughter is like my daughter only. Don't act like a fool. Come to senses and accept her as your daughter-in-law. How can he accept without getting good dowry? Damn, for silly dowry, will you refuse a good girl? It is your luck to get such a goddess like girl as your daughter-in-law. If you refuse her not only in this village. I will ensure that your son will not get a bride in this district itself. What? Going overboard for falling at your feet. If not that girl or your daughter... Will not my son ever get married? Cannot I get a daughter-in-law to my house? Madam, I have studied social studies too. Andhra Pradesh has many districts, not just this one. - What do you say, Srisailam? - It was on the tip... It was on the tip of your tongue and you said it nastily. Go... Go away. We will go away! Do you think we are shameless people? Come, let us go. Go man! Avaricious fools. Madam, I thought you will accept the proposal for the enemity with Seetharam. Refusing their proposal you had saved honour of this village. I just managed to save village's honour. But could not save the honour of Mr. president. Why are you saying like that, madam? You told them to accept Malleshwari as their daughter-in-law. I told them but they will not accept. He does not want just the bride. He wants the temple land donated to you by president. Has the marriage been stopped for temple land? That is what, she is saying, is not it? If you say that girl's marriage will happen. We are ready to return lands. What will happen nastily. If you alone return it? All others must join you, is not it? We will also return it. She is not just Mr. Krishnamurthy's daughter, she is like our daughter too. Marriage is their family is like marriage in our family. Tell us madam, we will sign any papers. We will put thumb impression wherever you ask us to. Throw this on his face and get that girl married. Stop! You asked me to get out and why are you getting in? She had asked you to get out, is not it? So, she has come with temple lands. How could you get it? I beat them with sentiment. Foolish people put their impressions like foolish goats. Brother's dream has come true. A sister's heart is filled with joy. Temple's lands have reached home. Give it to me, I will keep it safely in the locker. - Sir, she is more clever than you. - Right! You will get the temple lands, the day your son marries my daughter. Okay! As soon as my son comes from America we will perform their marriage. - Sister! A great good news. - What is it? That Seetharam's sister has slipped. It is rainy season, is not it? She might have slipped. Any fractures? Slipped does not mean that slipped. She is carrying! She is pregnant. Very good! This weapon is enough, to ruin his prestige. Father! Father! Stop. Killing our god like Krishnamurthy. Have you come like devil to garland him? Shameless creature. Did I kill him? What did I do? What did you do? Promising to get president's daughter married. You took our thumb impressions, went there and stopped the marriage. Unable to bear that insult he hanged himself to death. Look, you are unnecessarily mistaking me. President did not die for the stopping of marriage... But because his daughter had become pregnant before marriage. Kota Pentaiah did not reject this proposal because of dowry. His future daughter-in-law became pregnant with her paramour. What is this wild accusation? You are alive just because you're a woman. In chastity, my sister is equal to goddess Seetha. My sister is epitome of chastity like Arundhathi. For justice and righteousness my father is an exemplary example. My father, who always brought good justice to everyone... Had died because of your treachery only. If yours is such a honourable family... How can your sister had become pregnant prior to marriage? She did not become pregnant to none other than... Her future husband... That Kota's son. Why did not Kota accept this marriage? For refusing to give the temple lands donated to poor people as dowry. If that is true, then let me see get your sister married to his son. I will perform! I will definitely do it. In front of the same people before whom you had insulted my sister. Before the same people whom you ruined my father's honour and brought his death. I will prove before them that my sister is chaste woman. I will prove that my father died because of you before them. I will make Kota's son marry my sister before the same people. I am calling you only. My auto is dumb. I did not call your auto... I had called you. What? Will you come? - Where shall we go? - To my house? [audio muted] So! Do I look like a cheap lady to you? Idiot! Early morning, I got beaten up for going wrong side. - Auto! - What? Any cases? I have been plying auto for 5 years. Till now not one case has been registered. I did not ask about that cases. - That case! - Oh! That case! You see, a suit case is going there just now. Go and get yourself booked. Be careful dear! - How is the case? - Terrible mental case. Go to police and get your teeth reset. Nasty face! He wants a case. Hey auto! Will you ply? Hey, are not you Kondababu? You are... Mr. Krishnamurthy's son Seetharam, is not it? How come you are here? I have come on an important work. Is there any good hotel nearby? There is one near by only. Come, I will take you there. - I will go sir! - Keep it here. - Get me drinking water. - Okay sir. Sit here dear. - How is the room sir? - Fine. Kondababu, if you don't have any work, stay with my sister for half an hour. - I will go out and come. - Yes sir. - Where are you going, brother? - I will go to brother-in-law's house. - Brother! - Tell me dear? Brother, he is a very good man. Don't abuse him in haste. I cannot bear even a spec falling into your eyes. Can I bear to see tears in your eyes? I will never do any work which can hurt your feelings. Without your son here and without knowing his idea... Betrothal means... I feel strange. It was on the tip of my tongue and you said it. If junior boss, had been here... He would have slapped him and put some sense into you. Why? Asking me why? Already he has fallen in love with Seetharam's sister. How can he refuse that goddess like girl and marry her brass girl? By tying the knot. Foolish P. A. I will make that golden statute to rust... And gave this brass statute a golden coating. With that my son will fall in love. Then, why are you delaying? Exchange the proposal. [chants] [metal plate clinks] Have you come? You will make an entry like this, you will kick the plate like this. I had expected this to happen. Shut up! Seetaram! What is this atrocity? If injustice is done to my sister, not just atrocity... I will remove your heads. If ever your son marries, he must marry my sister only. If anyone comes as daughter-in-law to this house. Only my sister must come. You must tie festoons only when my sister enters this house. You must apply turmeric to the threshold. Any auspicious function must be celebrated only after my sister comes here. If you make her shed tears failing to do all this... I will turn this home into a grave. The same dialogue was on the tip of my tongue. He said it. Same slap! I thought of slapping him, but slapped you. This is just advance. If you accomplish the job, I will pay you 1 more lakh. Okay! Tell me, what you want me to do? Tomorrow, my son is flying back to India saying I love India. As soon as he gets down... Saying like this, he will straight away go to Malleshwari. If he goes there, Seetharam will tell him the truth and... Get his sister married to him. - So... - Your son must not meet them. Even if he meets them, he must refuse her to marry. - That is all, is not it? - You are right. You receive your son and come directly to the hotel in which they are staying. - I think this is the hotel. - Yes. Come on... Hey! Who are you? What is all this? Pearl designs. You are a prostitute, I am a customer. Arrest them. What is all this? Please leave me. [tires screeching] - Please leave me... - Hey! Come with us. You didn't believe my words, did you? See it yourself. - Dear! - Shut up! Leave me. Dear! Start the car. - Dear! - Where are you going? Dear... - Leave me... Leave me! - Come on. Shut your mouth and get into the jeep. Go! Dear Malleshwari... What is this? Room is like this... Something has happened here. Malleshwari! Dear Malleshwari... Sir! Did you see my sister? Just now, police arrested and took her away. Police arrested... why? For prostitution. What did you blabber? Hey, stop! Why are you beating him? Will he dare to call my sister a prostitute? Police have told that, if possible go and beat them. Where is the police station? Here! Sign here saying that Baji Babu and you have an affair. You will not get any harsh sentence. Maybe a day's jail or maybe a fine of Rs 100. If you refuse to sign... The brother who had brought you up with loving care... The brother who loves you so much... He will really get killed. Do you want a brother's life or chastity? She will not listen this way. Find her brother and kill him, boys. Alright sir! No... No! Please don't harm my brother. I will do as you ask me. Good! Blood relationship must be like this. Come! Take it. Sign it. [cupboard falls] Brother. Who is the scoundrel who has brought you here? It's me. Brother! Brother! No brother... Oh God! He almost killed me, sir. Yes, true! He has killed you. Didn' you get it? He must die. That means, you must not be alive. If you are alive... he will also be alive. So, die just once. No... No! - Come dear... Come. - Please, don't kill me. - No. - Hey! [pistol fire] Hey! What happened here? Seetharam killed S. I. and was escaping from here. What is your duty? Catch him... Catch him... Seetharam is escaping after killing S. I. Seetharam is escaping after killing S. I. They accused me killing S. I. and ensured that I was given death sentence. Kota's son, who should become my sister's husband... When he was about to marry Vasundhara's daughter... Finding no other way to stop the marriage... I married that girl! You have done a good thing, son-in-law. - Son-in-law? - Yes. The girl you married is non other than my daughter. That means you are... Vasundhara's abandoned husband. Yes. In few days of marriage I understood her proud mentality. I wanted a good home loving wife. But she wanted a hen pecked husband. Thinking that she will change at least, after becoming a mother... I lived with her for 2 years. She could become mother of 2 children... But she could never become the wife I had wished for. So, unable to stay with her... I'm living alone for 20 years. Knowing that my daughter is getting married... I came there to fulfill my duties as a father. Meanwhile you came and tied the auspicious thread. After knowing about you... I am very proud of getting a man like you as my son-in-law. Like my wife, my daughters have also grown up proudly. If they have to change, only you can bring it in them. If I had been your son-in-law, I would have fulfilled your wish. But now I am a prisoner awaiting death sentence. In law, if there is one section to sentence death... There are 10 sections to avoid it. I am an advocate who knows about all that. I will free you. Reform my family as well as your sister's life. That lord Rama has sent you as my companion. Don't chant Rama's name and be innocent. Hereafter you are not lord Rama. You are lord Krishna. All this has cropped up because of Seetharam marrying Pappi. She did not do it willingly, is not it. Though it may not be... But my son says once married is like second hand only. Look, sister! Since your younger daughter is also of marriageable age... If you make her my daughter-in-law... Neither my son nor I will be embarrassed. If I get younger one married, what will be the position of elder one. What is there? As soon as younger gets married, we will snap elder one's auspicious thread. Silently, we will get her married in far away place. If you go on Ponder, Seetharam will marry your second daughter also. This idea was on the tip of my tongue. You said it. Sister, decide it fast. Then we will get them married. Then, without any further delay, I will arrange the marriage. Come. - Excuse me... - Yes? I am Gundal Mandela from South Africa. Has my Megastar Toyota come here? Megastar Toyota? - Who is he? - Asking who is he? To whom the kerosene in your stove belongs to? To whom the petrol in your car belongs to? To whom the silk in your saree belongs to? To whom the diamond in your necklace belongs to? To whom the TV in your house belongs to? To whom your fridge belongs to? Ours! There, you have gone wrong! All these things are from our Toyota's companies! Does he own so many companies? These are just few! He has still innumerable. Who do you think his grandfather is? Mr. Honda! Great grandfather's Mazda. His entire family is Leyland. Where is he now? Morning in Pakistan, afternoon in Malaysia, evening Singapore, night in Russia. But on Sundays he will stay in America. But now he is coming from Dubai. - Why is he coming here? - To marry! To marry...? Why is he here? Mr. Sivaramakrishna is a good friend of my boss. Thinking that he stays here only, he has given message that he will come here. We had come here to enquire if he is here or not. [chopper thumping] Look there! He is arriving. - Good morning my dear boss. - Morning. Welcome my dear Toyota, welcome to India. - Wow! - Wow! What a beautiful charming and fantastic girl. Nice to meet you baby. I am Toyota. Why are you shying away to give your hand? Shake before use. This is Dubai culture. No problem... - Shake hands... Shake hands. - Come on baby. What a shocking hand. Touching a hand for the first time it feels like... Wow! I like this shyness very much... - Mr. Sivaram! - Yes Mr. Toyota? I have visited all countries but I have never seen a great beauty than her. I like this baby very much. If I ever marry, I will marry this miss only. Sorry Mr. Toyota, she is my... I know she is your grand daughter. - No! No... - Oh daughter? - No... No man! She is my wife. - No jokes. If you say this young maiden is your wife... Do you think am I any fool coming from Duvvada to believe it? I have come from Dubai. Mother, promise! She is really my wife, aged 52 years. No... I can't believe. - You are calling this sweet 16 baby... - You are calling her sweet 16! Her daughters are themselves crossing 16 years. Tell him! Yes! She is my mother! No! No... I can't believe this. - Oh my god! Bad luck, bad luck. - Oh no... Accept it stoically. Come, let us go to guest house and take rest. - Dear, dear! - What dear? - Not you! She called me! What is it? - Oh she called you? It will not look good if you make your friend stays in guest house. Ask him to stay here only. If it had been my house, I would have invited. But this is your house, isn't it? Silly boy! Shut up! As wife and husband, there will be many fights and abuses. For that, do we become strangers? Forget all the past and invite him. What is it? Brides photos to be shown to Mr. Toyota. Great thing! You have a bride at home. Are you showing other's photos? Nicely set up our Pappi for him. Pappi? She is already married, is not it? How can a forced marriage be called as marriage? We will hide it and calmly get her married to him. Then, the true colour will be out. If he comes to know about the truth after marriage... He will kick her in Paris, she will reach India without visa. Then, we will get Bobby married to him. But you had promised to get her married to Kota's son. With a Toyota here, why are talking about cheap people like Kota? Go and tell him to marry our Bobby. What is it mother, you are talking about marriage? Your marriage only! I have thought of getting you married to Toyota. Oh! My great mother! What a great news you have told me. That means, do you like him? I like him just not like that, I like him madly. I feel like eloping with him. My great daughter! What a great discipline you have. You are a chip of the old block. Oh my God! Why did you come out? Since no one was coming inside! Bobby! Take son-in-law upstairs. - Son-in-law? Who? - You! - To whom? - To me! Oh God! How can I be your son-in-law? That means my daughter has fallen in love with you at first sight. That is why! For that, will you give me cheaply a son-in-law's post, aunty? What we can do? As you sow, so you reap! Okay! I will adjust with her in this life. In my next birth, I will not leave you at any cost. - That means... Is my daughter okay to you? - No... No! All my required things are there in her or not. I will tell after testing her for 3 days. - Testing for 3 days? What will you do? - Shut up! He will do anything in the Dubai tradition. Why are you concerned about it? Son-in-law, you go out with my daughter! What a great couple. Anyone will look great next to him. That is why he has become Megastar. "I've seen your red cheeks while you were feeling shy baby." "Good! Good! Very good... I have seen Bollywood and Hollyood." "I know that dear..." "Let your lips meet mine." "I've seen your red cheeks while you were feeling shy baby." "Good! Good! Very good... I have seen Bollywood and Hollyood." "I'll take your breath away with my dance, I'll make you fall by a wink" "I'll give my beauty... handsome man." "I'll take the fragrance out in embraces and I will see your passion." "I will just kiss you beautiful lady." "Oh my god! Macho!" "I don't want early morning romance." "Oh beauty! I am ready come on." "My madness doesn't know morning or night." "When the naughty man teased me and laid hands on my beauty." "My walk changed being shy." "I've seen your red cheeks while you were feeling shy baby." "Good! Good! Very good... I have seen Bollywood and Hollyood." "I will watch you hiding behind the trees and the fruits." "I will write a song for you my dear" "I'll make you sweat" "I will give a meaning to the bed" "I will let you kiss my cheek." "Hey baby, come we will roam around like an advanture." "How is it possible to make your heart warm dear." "Hey man, I am not going to come out for romance." "Morning romance is a pain." "When this modern girl is making me fall for her." "The young age doesn't simply stop." "I've seen your red cheeks while you were feeling shy baby." "Good! Good! Very good... I have seen Bollywood and Hollyood." "I know that dear..." "Let your lips meet mine." Sister, you will not believe me if I tell you. He is a true man. He is loving, caring... Oh God! Really he is very romantic. Yes, romantic, fantastic, elastic and your lipstick too. Tell me, what Toyota has and what my son lacks to regret our alliance? Why not? On that day, you came to fix alliance with Pappi... But fixed alliance with president's daughter, is not it? This is similar to that. Having that in your mind, you had taken revenge, is not it? I am neither having that in my mind nor in the bureau. We rejected you since we got a better alliance than yours. You are saying that since you got an alliance than us... You fixed with Toyota. If you get a better alliance than Toyota, will you fix alliance with him? - Maybe I will. - I will see. I will see how you will conduct this marriage. Hey, aunty! Who is that man? He was saying that he is going to see something. He is a well digger. He is asking if there is any work for him? Hey, what is this? Aunty, is she your real daughter? What is it, son-in-law? Why are you asking like that? Then, what is this aunty? You look like a knife, she looks like a goat. But she looks like a dry leaf. I don't like these dry leaves. I only like knifes and goats. Even she is alike a goat. When she was about to get married... She met with a small accident and she had turned into a dry leaf. - Sir... - Yes Mandela. - Auto ready sir. Helicopter is ready sir. - Oh yeah! See you baby. - Bye... - Mr. Gundel Mandela! - Yes. - Where sir is going? He has to put ring to her finger on the engagement day, is not it. He is going to Singapore to buy that. Mother-in-law, are you fine? Bobby, are you fine? Is my Pappi fine? - Father-in-law, are you fine? - I am fine. Shut up. Why did you come here? This is very nice... Why will a son-in-law come to mother-in-law's house? - For first night... - Don't talk nonsense! You are going to die in a day or two... Do you want first night? That is where I get irritated. Mother-in-law, I am not going to die in near future. My case has gone from district court to supreme court. It will take another 5-6 years to get the verdict... Before that, I will live with my wife... I will prove my innocence... And I will catch the murderers. If you are involved with the murderers, then you will be finished. By the way. Where is my wife? Oh! My wife... Oh! My sweet heart... Oh! My wife... Oh my wife! Oh God! Why have you become so thin? Were you deeply concerned about me? Don't worry? I have come back, is not it. - Hey! Get out. - Come. - That is where I get irritated. - Damn! Without completing the virtual. Where will I go mother-in-law? - My dear... - Hey! Okay, leave it mother-in-law... It seems that you had brought a man from Dubai. - What is happening? - Oh! My god! She is not keeping him. Hes only a guest. That is it, what is the relation between you and that Dubai man? - Yes, you have got the point. - Shhh... Okay. I will take care of him later. First, I will look after your poor daughter. Make arrangements for the first night. Mother-in-law, do you have milk? I have poison. You drink that. Keep a glass of milk ready. Mean while, I will go and buy Jasmine flowers and sweets. Mother-in-law, I will leave. Father-in-law, see you. - Come fast son-in-law, it's getting late. - Okay... Okay... Are you not ashamed to call him as our son-in-law? If you are able to call Toyota as son-in-law even before tying the knot... Why should I feel ashamed for calling him our son-in-law after marriage. Son-in-law? I will see how he will come back to this house. Hello, Vasundhara madam. What is the matter? He has come to our house and is creating lots of trouble. Come fast. Hey, my better half. Look at these flower and sweets. Get ready soon. [glass breaks] Stop it. We called you to threaten him and send him out. Not to kill him. Go away. Very nice... My wife. I got beaten up only to know whether you love me or not? If you are not interested that he kills me... It means you really love me, isn't it? Now, I will show who I am... - Uncle... - Yes. Make arrangements for the nuptial night. In the meantime, I will beat them and come. - Come fast son-in-law, it's getting late. - Okay... Okay... Did you hear that? Come. Psst psst... You are lucky, since I have my nuptial night. Else you would have your nuptial night with this. Get lost. - Rascal! - Oh! My god! What is this? All three have grouped and come to the bedroom. - What do you mean, by this? - Get out. Only you two must get out, not me. - Come, my Pappi. - We will never go. Okay, father-in-law... Father-in-law. Yes. They are unwilling to go out. - You, switch off the power for some time. - Okay! Uncle... It means... All three of them... - Aunty! - What is it? - What is this? What is this?! - This is first night set up. First night? For whom was this first night? With whom was this nuptial night conducted? - Actually... - Yesterday, was our marriage anniversary. Though I said no he decorated. - Isn't it? - Yes, yes! So, the first night was for you... - Don't you have brains? - Mother-in-law... - What is it? - What is this garbage? - I don't like this garbage. Throw it out. - Okay. Your father-in-law had kept all his clothes in it. He is a bloody country. Shut up! [Bangaru Kodi Petta song from the film Gharana Mogudu] What is it, mother-in-law? You are carrying my baggage. Are you going to throw it out? Oh! My mother-in-law. Till I give you a child I will not leave this place. Please go and keep the baggage inside. Look, Mr. Toyota has come to my house... Just go out without making any nonsense. If you talk like that I will get irritation. There is nothing for the son-in-law, but everything for the future son-in-law. - I will not accept this. - What will you do? It should be either him or me who stays in this house. I will teach him a lesson, now itself. - Look... Look... - Get lost. - Seetaram. - Hey you, Mr. Dubai... How dare of you to stay in here in my mother-in-law's house before marriage. Come out. We will see whether it is you or me today itself. What is it? Why are you looking like that? Hey mister! Who are you? What nonsense are you talking? Hey, if you act smart with me, I will get your head roll out. Shut up! Shut up. If you say shut up, I will hit you with Hawaii chappals. I said get out! How dare you to ask a son-in-law to get out? My god! [bashing] I will show you my power... - What happened, son-in-law? - My god! Country brook. How hard you have hit me? Hey, Seetharam... Aunty! Don't get tensed. I will show him my Dubai style. - Please wait here. - Be careful... Be careful. Where are you? So, you are here. Was not that enough which I gave you? Have you come again? I have come back to give you with interest. - Oh my god! - He is beating him. [sobs] - What is this? - Get lost. You've made an innocent guy like me beaten up by that Dubai man? I will see. You will be coming to my village, is not it? I will push you down and stamp you. Get lost. The bad omen has left. He will not step in again. Mother, don't know how is Mr. Toyota? - Son-in-law... - Darling! We cannot hear anything from inside. Mother, maybe something has happened to him. - Son-in-law... - What is it, mother? Have not you gone... Oh, I am sorry aunty. Mr. Toyota, nothing had happened to you, is not it? No aunty, I am fine. I had come across many things like this, in Gulf. Where is he? Unable to bear your hits. He had ran away. Oh! Is it... My dear... Boss! Boss... What is this, boss? Boss, It seems there was some trouble here. Oh, nothing. By the way... Have all the arrangements got over for the engagement? Yes, they are over. - In our 18 autos... no 18 flights, - Yeah! Our guests are coming tomorrow in the lunch time. - Is it? That's fine. - Yeah! - At what time did you fixed the function? - Night 7.30 pm boss. Okay! - Mr. Gundela Mandela. - Boss. - Come here. - Yes. - How is Malleshwari? - She is very fine in my house. Don't worry about your sister. She is innocent girl. Please take care of her. What is it? What are you talking about sister? It is... Yeah! My sister is coming from Dubai for my engagement. I was asking him to take care of the arrangements. - Do you have a sister? - Yeah! Only one sister. He is very fond of her sister. Then, bring her here straightaway. Oh! Bloody heating India... Front heat, back heat, up heat and down heat. Hey man, put on the fan I say. - Come on, follow me. - Welcome... - Welcome your highness. - Oh! Thank you. Thank you. Where is he? He is receiving bouquet from the Junior artists over there. - Hi, hi... Thank you. - Brother... brother... Brother... [balloon bursts] - What was that noise? - The balloon on the right side burst. You idiot... What to do now? There is an apple below the bouquet, push it up. - Mr. Toyota! - Yeah! - Where is your finance? - She is on her way... Look she is coming. - Hi... - Hi! - Hey, sister-in-law. - You... I am Ms. Dakota, he is my brother. You are my sister-in-law and I am your sister-in-law. Look sister, she is not your sister-in-law, - She is your sister-in-law's mother. - Oh my god! - She is mother? She does not look so old. - You are very sweet. Did you see? Even my sister did not believe that you are a mother of 2 daughters. If my mother-in-law is so beautiful... How beautiful will your daughter be? Is she my sister-in-law? - Oh! Fantastic. Brother... - Yeah... Who is my sister-in-law? The front one or the one at back. - Front! - Oh super... Brother super! Hey, we are brother and sister here. We are not lovers. - Stop your over acting. - Okay. - By the way... She is the elder daughter. - Hi... And she is the younger one. - Hi... - Hi! - Hello sir. - Yeah! - Can you come here? I will take a snap. - Sure... Aunty, will you join us? - Oh! - Please... [chuckles] [chuckles] Ah! Ready? Excuse me... [camera capture] What is this? My boss is making a pass at all 3 women in the name of photo! Even, I fear the same. "It's time to teach aunt and her daughter a lesson." "It's time to show the power to the three of them." "The mother is hot-headed, the daughter is naughty as hell." "I don't want to leave any leaf unturned." "It's time to teach aunt and her daughter a lesson." "It's time to show the power to the three of them." "Get into my joyful friendship." "Oh my romantic fellow, you play your gimmics with your eyes." "Our first kiss itself was too much for me." "Yeah! Yeah!" "Oh my! Oh dear!" "Don't know if you are a cowboy or a lover boy or a playboy." "My lips long for you my dear." "Thank you." "The din of the ladies is raising my heart beat" "I'll make you three sleep with my lullaby." "You are a right son-in-law for your aunt." "It's time to teach aunt and her daughter a lesson." "It's time to show the power to the three of them." "Hey boy, what's this?" "I am your mother-in-law..." "You make sure you don't fall in my eyes." "Ain't it so!" "Keep faking it with no bounds." "Oh mother-in-law, you are so thick skinned." "You've turned old but your beauty is awesome." "Go, man!" "You got a partner at the right age and the right stats." "Come more closer to me and make me feel shy." "Share the bounty of kisses." "It's time to teach aunt and her daughter a lesson." "It's time to show the power to the three of them." "The mother is hot-headed. Hey, aunt!" "The daughter is naughty as hell." "I don't want to leave any leaf unturned" [crowd claping] Dear friends... Now, Mr. Toyota will put the diamond ring to his fiancee Bobby. Happy ring day to you... Happy ring day... [chuckles] Son-in-law... You must put ring to my daughter, not to my wife. Oh! I am sorry, I am sorry! Happy ring day to you... Happy ring day to you... [Crowd: Happy ring day to you...] Stop it. What is this Mr. Toyota? Did you come from Dubai to marry this second hand? What are you talking? - Nuptial night for this girl is over. - What! What? What are you saying? - Is the nuptial night's over for my Bobby? - Not only your Bobby sir... But also this girl and that mother, all their nuptials over in one night. - With Seetaram. - You mean three in one? - Yeah! - You shut up! Son-in-law, please do not believe him. He is telling lies. Seetharam told this personally to us. If you want know, please ask him. - What Mr. Siva Ram! What is this? - Sir, actually... Yes, nuptial night's over. But it is a suspense with whom did it happen. You bloody cheaters! I came to Andhra believing that chaste women like Anusuya, Savithri are here. Are you trying hook me to these second hand cases? - Are you trying to cheat me? - Son-in-law... - No! - Please listen to me. - Don't touch! - Okay... Okay! Being a mother to 2 daughters... I thought when you dressed up like a young girl... That you have the sort of a woman. What do you know about here? She will show you a temple in Peddapuram and make you believe it is Tirupathi. I will kill you... Are you all trying to cheat my brother? - You... - Down! Cool down madam. - Cool down. - I will shoot them down. - Please... Please. - Gundel Mandela. - Boss, even my heart is burning. - I will not stay here for another second. - Yes! - Sister! Start. - Okay! - Son-in-law... Son-in-law. - Madam... - Darling! - Madam! - No... - Come on sister. - Sir... Sir... - Nice to meet you sir. - Thank you sir. You came and saved my life in time. How can I pay you back? It's your wish. Rs 5 or Rs 10, we will take anything you give... - Sure! - You, shut up. Sir, if you do not mind, I will make a small request. Tell me. I came to know that your sister is still not married. Yes, we are looking for a better groom. Our Kota has a son. He is not a cheap, dirty fellow like him. Very good gentle man. My son is also from foreign. At present, he is in U.S. - If you say yes... - Why not? Not only my sister, I will give you anything you ask for the help you did. - Brother... - Who is this black beauty? - I am Kota... Kota! - I am Dakota... Dakota! Kota, Dakota... The names are matching very well. Brother... I like this blacky. I like him very much. Will not you perform our marriage? Marry his son, not to him. I will take care of his son later. First, I will marry his father. Why do you need him? He has completed his service and has come for reboring. Hey! His son is very fit and fine. He will suit you very well. I see. First, I will see his son. If I don't like him, - I will marry his father. - Okay! Okay... Madam... Hey! You... Why did you come again? Was not the beatings enough? Not enough! They were too much. That is why I will take my baggage and pumpkin. Go to my village to till fields. They are in the corner, take them and go. Do you have brain or not? Why are you asking our son-in-law to go? Or else, do you want me to serve him? Idiot, it is not that. If we soften Seetharam and bring him to our side... If we ask him to tell Mr. Toyota that the nuptial night was not with Bobby... - Then he will become my husband. - Correct! I did not get such a good idea. You always get ideas to destroy a family, not to unite a family. Son-in-law... - Whom are you calling? - You only! - Oh! My god! Me? - You only. - Come inside. - Come inside, brother-in-law. - Oh! My god! - Since you are calling me by relation. There is going to be some problem in it. - Nothing like that, son-in-law. - I will not believe. You are trying to beat me up again with the Dubai man. I know... Give me my pumpkin, I will go. No, son-in-law, these people have really changed now. Father-in-law, I am believing your word. My sweet son-in-law... Don't know when you had your lunch? - Please come and have your food. - Come... Come... Mother-in-law, I eat only non-vegetarian food. Why not? Look here... Chicken, fish, mutton and eggs, everything is here. But I want salt fish. Salt fish! Tomorrow, I will cook for you. Please eat... - Please eat... - What happened, my dear son-in-law? Like how a son-in-law is unlucky despite having everything. I cannot eat anything. - Why? - Why not? Because of that Dubai man's blows... My fingers are smashed. I cannot eat with my own hand. I will feed you... Please eat. Mother-in-law... Mother-in-law, don't feed me with mouthful. They will choke my food pipe, so feed me little quantities. I will eat happily. Have it... - Is it ok? - Double ok. - Hey, father-in-law... - What, son-in-law? Swing! Swing! Swing! I want to sit here and eat. Son-in-law, son-in-law. That is your mother-in-law's seat. For the past 20 years she never allowed me also to sit there. This only irritates me. Does not mother-in-law's seat belong to son-in-law? - Mother-in-law, what do you say? - Yes! It is. Please sit... Hey, Pappi and Bobby! What are you looking like that? Come and push swing. Push the swing! Push it speedly. This is very tight and nice. - Mother-in-law, you can kiss me now. - Kiss?! No... No! Not the kiss, food... Food bite. - You have it. - You feed that. - Dear son-in-law... - What is it, mother-in-law? I will ask you one favour, can you do it? Mother-in-law, I am ready to do any favour for you. Nothing, that night... You must tell Mr. Toyota that you have not done anything with Bobby. Only this much! Certainly I will tell. - Oh! Thank you, thank you. - But on one condition... What is that? Before I tell this to Mr. Toyota... The blame on my sister's character should be removed and... Her marriage should be performed with the son of Mr. Kota. Son-in-law isn't easy! How soon you people perform the marriage of my sister... So soon I will tell Mr. Toyota and perform the marriage of our Bobby. Mother-in-law, I am leaving now. Why this scoundrel is coming in this route? Let him come in any route... We should bring him to our route. Don't waste time and do whatever he said. - Hi... - Hi! Hi... What is this baby? Why did you wear this dress? I want to be Indian and buy Indian, that is why. - Isn't it good? - It is wonderful. - Saree or baby? - Both. Then, why do not you marry that baby? - Me? - Yes. I thought of getting her married to my son, is not it? Oh! Your son will get hundreds of girls. But for your dirty face you will not get a girl like this with a big oil well. That is true... But I am an aged person. Go to a bar and drink beer, automatically your age will get reduced. Don't miss the chance. That girl is liking you very much. That's right... But her brother should agree for our marriage, is not it? For Mr. Toyota, sister is his life... For this sister, you are her life. So there is no chance of saying refusing. Look, how attractive she is? Go and commit yourself with her. I will go away. Do you know dancing? Only after seeing you I got the mood for dancing. You are dancing well, that is why I like you very much. Please help me... Help! Please help me... Hello, Police station? A rape is going on at Mr. Kota Pentaiah's house. Please, come quickly. Help! You stop. - Help me! Please help me... - Stop it! I will break you. [tires screeching] What is this sir? You have come after the rape is over. - Is it over so soon? - It was over, long back. - Where? - Look! There. - Help me... Help me please... - Hey! Get up. Rascal! Are you raping a lonely girl? Come on. Sir, please listen to me. Inspector, I did not rape her, sir. Don't open your mouth, else I will kill you. Take the Dakota madam to hospital for testing. I don't know... What they are going to test? I am damn afraid of these tests. You need not worry. In our drama the doctor is also an actor. He will take care of everything. You go and lie down on the table. We will stand outside. Control yourself, sir. Control. - My sister... - Very pity... His sister is his life. Doctor! You have been asked to attend to this rape case. - Which room? - Dr. Rai's room. Sister! That rape case was to be attended by Dr. Rai, is not it? Why she is going? He is attending some emergency case. So, superintendent had sent this madam. Oh god! We are in trouble. - What are we going to do? - I am not able to understand that only. I don't know what is going to happen! They said male doctor will attend, why did she come? Are you miss Dakota? No! No! Yes! Yes! I am. Why did you come, madam? Are you the rape victim? Yes madam. Why did you come, madam? They told a foreigner, but you are looking like an Indian. Actually, I am made in Seethanagaram, madam. But settled in Dubai, madam. That is right. Why did you come, madam? You first lie down. I want to see. - What? - Huh! Oh! No, madam. Since you are a lady... If you see, you will get frightened and die. I don't want it. I have seen hundreds of cases like this. It's okay for me. You lie down first. Oh! Madam, please, don't do it. I am very shy... Madam. Why shy? I am a lady, you are also a lady. How can I tell you, madam? Madam, by seeing me you will become a sinner. Will you allow me to perform my duty or not? In spite of my repeated warnings, if you fail to understand, means. It is your ill fate. That is all. Look at me. Look at me in full... What is this? What happened? Why she is wriggling like this? Mother promise, sir. I have not done anything, sir. I repeatedly requested her not to see... She never listened and checked me. She fell down like this. Very pity. While testing... She might have got shock of her life. She is a rape victim. Why did doctor get the shock? That means that demon had damaged my sister so cruelly. Pity. On seeing that, doctor got shocked. Hey, Dr. Rai, we are in great danger. You have to rescue all of us. Will you please wait outside? Why did not you tell me this earlier itself? Repeatedly I was warning you, madam. You only told that it is my duty to see... - Your duty, to see and you saw, fell down. - Shut up! I am telling you sorry for what had happened. Doctor, kindly help us in this issue and save my sister's life. Okay. Doctor, the molestation? Went well! A lie should be believable. No girl will invite you, saying molest me today... molest me tomorrow. She will never ask... Even at the cost of her life. She asked me. Even if she asks... How can you molest your future daughter-in-law? She agreed to marry me. Lawyer sir, no doubt. - He has molested her for sure. - Damn you! I have not done it. But, very strong evidences are there. Sir, a minimum 10 years imprisonment is possible. Since it is a foreign case... Chances are there for life imprisonment also. What? Life term? Kindly rescue my life from this situation, sir. I will give lakhs of rupees to you. There is a way of rescuing you without spending a pie. Will you do that? What is that? You should perform the marriage of your son with Mr. Seetharam's sister. You should say that S. I. was murdered by Bazi and not my Seetaram in the court. If you are prepared to do these two things... I will get you out without any punishment. What is the connection between this case and those cases? That is what you call as tit for tat. Will you do as per my advice or not? If you don't do it, you will die in the prison itself. First agree to do it and tell the same. Okay. I will do it. I don't want it. How long will you live without food? What are you going to do, starving your stomach? I want to die. - Bobby! - Yes! Mother! Why should I live after losing my honour? On that day Mr. Seetharam... Spoiled my sister's life by forcefully tying auspicious thread. You were just a mute spectator. In the name of first night, he had played with all of us in darkness. Unable to tell the truth we are keeping our mouth shut... In party he branded us as character less women and insulted me. We were not in a position to answer that. Then, why should we live? For whose sake we must live? Let us go. We will all die together. My wife! Have you come in search of me? Are you so fond of your husband? Come and sit. We will talk together. I have not come for sitting leisurely. Then, have you come here to stand? Then, stand like that. That is right. It seems you had come alone... What is the meaning of it? Have you changed your heart? I came to know... What is there in your heart? I swear on your mother... I like you madly. Shut your mouth. Idiot! Hey, why are you calling your husband with names like idiot and omelette. You may lose your eyes. Husband? Huh... By forcefully marrying me. You have spoiled my entire life. And dragged our honourable family to streets. If your grudge is not yet satisfied... You do anything, with my life. But don't spoil the marriage of my sister. And don't ruin her life also. Oh! My god! Why are you blaming me like this? Since her life is spoiled, your sister's marriage also got spoiled. Why are you blaming me for that? Hey, don't act too smart? For the sake of your sister's marriage... You are playing this drama victimizing all of us. Oh god! You too have come to know the secret? So... For your sister's marriage. Are you making my sister a scape goat? Making scape goats is the business of your mother. What has my mother done? For having an affair and getting pregnant with someone... Your sister's marriage got cancelled. Without any shyness your sister came to the streets, so... If you talk one more word about my sister... I will cut down you into pieces. By branding my sister as prostitute... It is your mother who had spoiled her marriage. With the father of her forthcoming child. To get you married to him... It is your mother who had put the entire blame on my sister... It is your mother who is responsible for the death of my god like father. To perform your marriage innocent farmers... had been cheated and their lands were looted by your mother. I had been jailed for a murder case... and sentenced to death, it is just because of your mother. You are feeling so sad for stopping your sister's marriage betrothal. Getting her marriage stopped and taking blame with pregnancy. How much sad she must be feeling? How much heart burn, I must be having? Not only your sister, even my sister has tears in her eyes. To teach you the value of those tears... And to open all of your eyes to the reality. I made Mr. Seetharam to perform the role of Mr. Toyota. In spite of your misdeeds. Mr. Seetharam stood up to his name and is a true Seetharam. On that night he has spoiled your dress and appearance. But he did not spoiled anyone of you. At least now onwards, not as your mother's daughter... You try to think like a woman. And safeguard the sacred thread around your neck. Dear. Only once... Why do not you call me your wife? Please... Not just once. If you wish, I will call you my wife every hour. You are my husband! Oh! My wife! My husband! Hey, don't feel too shy. People are seeing us. Let them see, why should I bother... You are my hubby and it's my wish! "Swing it with a lullaby." "Rock it with an embrace." "Give me the hot beauty." "Give me that well deserved kiss." "Little would I feel bad!" "Sleep with a lullaby." "I'll rock it with my beauty." "You've got a pass for my beauty." "This is a call for entertainment." "So enjoy it!" "Swing it with a lullaby." "I'll rock it with my beauty." "Your beauty is intoxicating me." "Oh my romantic damsel." "My shyness is so cute." "Oh my macho man." "It's my kiss on your cheek." "My sweet heart is for your love." "Let your beauty be a feast in the moon light." "Swing it with a lullaby." "Rock it with an embrace." "Youth has stung me, oh my god!" "Oh my cupid!" "Whatever this young kid wants." "Give it to him with love." "Would you break the promise?" "I'll take away all the beauty." "Pair up with me and defeat my youth... with enthusiasm." "Swing it with a lullaby." "I'll rock it with my beauty." "Give me the hot beauty." "This is a call for entertainment." "Little would I feel bad!" Hey, Shiva! When did you come? Just now! By mistake, if you get death sentence... At least he will meet you for last time. I only called him over the phone. My son, really I don't know any sin. My son. Ugh! You treacherous fellow. Sinner! By mistake I was born to your wife... At this age, why did you have sinful intention? - Hey. - No... These words were on the tip of your son's tongue, sir. He was hesitating to say it... So, I said it for him, that is all. My son! Do you know what had actually happened there? Shut up! I know everything. I am feeling shame to consider you as my father. Hey, Srisailam! What is this? That is right only... I am feeling shame myself to consider as your P.A. There is nothing wrong in his feelings. Look... lawyer sir! My own son also not believing my words. If you say in the court what I have already told you... Everyone will believe. No problem... I will say. Will that Dakota say nothing has happened? Yes, I will say... To safeguard the life of another lady... To free an innocent person from jail. I will say that, I have not lost my chastity. My sister, Dakota... Is there such a sacrificing side hidden in you, dear? - Yes, Brother. - Dear... Oh woman, you are an epitome of sacrifice... Oh woman, you are an epitome of affection. - It's okay, go... Go... - Okay. [screaming loud] Brother! Shut your mouth and come. Leave me... Leave me... [tires screeching] Hey, where are you taking her? Who are you to ask that? I am the person whose concubine she is. Without my knowledge, are you having him also as your paramour? Since how long this sin is been going on? Tell me! Without our knowledge are you maintaining both of us? Tell me! Tell me! Who is father of your forthcoming child... Is it me or he? Tell me. Tell me. Tell me. If you try to beat her again... I will kill you. Why should you bother if we beat her... Is she your sister? Whenever a girl is in distress she need not be my sister? Any man can save her. Look... You have come from other country. You don't know about her. She is a prostitute. Her own brother sold her for Rs 50,000 to me. Even his brother did not worry, why do you worry? Lie, it is a lie. No brother will sell his sister. Will he not sell? Where is Seetharam, who sold her to me? I don't know. Don't you know? - Tell me the truth, tell me. - I don't know. I will kill you, if you don't tell. - Even if you kill me, I don't know! - Tell me! You will not tell the truth if I ask you like this. Tell me... Tell me... I will not tell you. Will not you tell me? When I am questioning about Seetharam, why do you get tensed? I am Seetharam! Very good! We did this to unmask you. If this Toyota is Seetharam, then who is this Dakota? His senior farm hand Abbulu. Did you see, buddy? They had acted to get you married to this prostitute. Brother-in-law, whatever they say are lies. She is not bad charactered. Shut up. Don't try to fool me. Brother. Seetharam came out on bail on medical grounds. The court condemns his indulgence in unlawful acts and cancels his bail. The court orders to execute the death sentence which was sentenced earlier. No! Mother, save him at any cost. Please give me back my husband. Husband? How can he be your husband who forcibly tied the auspicious thread? For the injustice we did to him and to his family. If it had been someone else, he would have chopped us into pieces. He had tied only the auspicious thread. Have you gone mad? Why do you support him as if you are his wife? Since he is my husband. Since I have understood him very well. Shut up. He is going to die in a day or two... How can he be your husband? Did you live with him? Don't be idiotic, snap and throw away the auspicious thread. Till I live, I will not snap it. It is wrong. You must listen to what your mother says. Snap the auspicious thread. One who does not live with her husband. Yes, a wife should not wear the auspicious thread. Vasundhara, she is not courageous. First you snap your auspicious thread. Seeing that, she will also snap her auspicious thread. Why are you looking like that Vasundhara? Even you do not live with your husband? Why do you need that auspicious thread? Snap it! What is it? Even you, do not have the courage to snap it? Shall I snap it? Neither you will allow me to snap it... Nor you will snap it yourself. Because it is very auspicious. Not only you, no woman will snap it when her husband is still alive. At least now, try to be good and see that she doesn't lose her auspicious thread. Oh! My god...! Oh my god! It seems they are changing the sides and forming a group. What shall we do now? My sister has no stable mind and will never change under any circumstances. - Is not it, sister? - Shut up Rascal! Did not I tell you, that your sister had hanged. If they can unite together, are we fools to keep quiet? Let us also unite together. This is good. Immediately, we will transfer temples lands to our name. Oh! My Bombay boy. You are physically strong but mentally weak. If we leave them after getting the lands on our names... They will leak out the murder of S. I. And framing her as a characterless woman. After that Seetharam will come out of the jail. He will give a blow to us then we will be behind the bars... And we will be singing songs on our bad fate. What shall we do now? - We will unite them into our party. - How? Tomorrow is lord Rama's birthday. Seetharam is going to be hanged on the day of lord Ram and Seetha's marriage. On that auspicious hour, you tie auspicious thread to elder daughter... And my son will tie auspicious thread to the younger daughter. With that, these two will be in our control and they will be under our foot. If we cut the scene, comic look on our faces and tragic on their faces. Let us go... I will kill you if, you touch my daughter. Hey, you brainless... You are better than a comedy artist but less than a character artist. If you act like a hero the audience will run away. Shut up, you... Okay! Right. Look, sister... Listen to us, till their marriages are conducted be silent under my control. Else, these girls and your husband will die. Look, henchmen... Take these people and keep them in our lockers. Come, we are to make arrangements for the marriage. Where is Seetharam? Did not you bring him? They are hanging him today. They said the rules do not permit to send a person who is going to be hanged. What shall we do now, priest? How can lord's marriage be conducted without Seetharam breaking the coconut? His last wish was to perform lord Rama's marriage without any hitches? We must fulfill Seetharam's wish. How can we fulfill? If they do not send Seetharam here, we will take this lord there. Let us go. Hail, lord Seetharam... [metal door creaks] [beeps] You have seen the bomb, didn't you? You must stay calm till the marriage is over. If you act silly I will press the remote. You will be blown into smithereens with the boat. Brother... Be aware of bomb. [beeps] [chants] Mother and daughter, please smile. Else, it will be known that this is a forced marriage. Your husband and Malleshwari will be in good state only when you keep smiling. Hail, Seetharam... Hail, Seetharam... [chants] CENTRAL JAIL, RAJAHMUNDRY. Hail, Seetharam... Hail, Seetharam... Hail, Seetharam... Sir, Seetharam's village people have come in the tractors to see this Seetharam. What for? Please send Seetharam out... What is all this? Sir, every year we make Seetharam to break the coconut, and... And conduct lord Ram's marriage with Seetha. We want him to break the coconut as before. But you had said that it is not possible to send him out. We must hang him within a few minutes. As you say, it is not possible to bring him out. Go away. We will not move until Seetharam breaks the coconut. Yes, we will not go... If you do not go, we will force you. Even if you take our lives, we will not move from here. Yes, we will not go. I am warning you to go, else we will open fire. You don't have to kill us. If you don't send Seetharam we will torch ourselves. We will die... We will die. Please send Seetharam out... Stop it... stop it... As per your wish, we will bring Seetharam and he will break the coconut. You should not create trouble after that. Okay sir. [metal door creaks] Hey, Seetharam. Please conduct god's marriage. Hail, Seetharam... Buddy, Kota had caught Sivaramakrishna and Malleshwari... And he is conducting marriages of Pappi and Bobby forcibly. You go and serve them. This is smoke bomb. - Hail, Seetharam... - Hail, lord Rama... [screaming] Seetharam is escaping catch him... - Greetings sir... - Is it you? Where is Seetharam? [chants] [screaming] [beeps] What are you looking at, Kota? Press the remote. Shoot them. [mechine gun fires] [chaos] [guns tumbles on ground] [gun tumbles on ground] [motor sound] [pistol fires] [bombs] Brother... No... No!

Everybody gives milk on the nuptial night... Why are you giving me liquor? It is not liquor, it is black tea. Is it black tea? Why do we need it now? If you drink milk, you will feel sleepy. If you drink this, you can be awake all night. Oh! My sweet heart! Even you are very romantic. - Please drink it. - Yes! Excellent! Please be in this romantic mood, I will tell you... What is this, sister-in-law? - Milk! - Excellent! Even you are giving me milk, what do you mean by this? From our childhood, we ate in one plate. You can eat even now, who is stopping you? We slept in a single bed. You can sleep even now, who is stopping you? Thanks... Please mix my milk and my sister's tea decoction and drink. It will become tea. - That means... - One auspicious thread and two wives. Oh my god! I am a devotee of lord Rama. Oh god, when I do not want two children what is this two wives? What shall we do now? ALL THE BEST.
