On via Aurelia 770 ... they left a Mini Minor. License plate GR153035. Inspired by the book by Enzo Siciliano. "Vita di Pasolini", Giunti 1995. Ostia Seafront, 2 November 1975, 01.30. Suspicious car racing on Ostia. We are going to stop it. Received. Do you have I.D. ? No. Name? Pelosi. I said name, not surname. Pino. Pino is a nick-name. Giuseppe. Look at me when you talk to me, Giuseppe Pelosi. What happened to your head? It hurts. You've already seen a doctor but it was nothing. Do you mean that you've hurt yourself? Yes. Good. Include this in the statement, so he won't say it was us. Sergeant. Look at this. Pier Paolo Pasolini. Do you know you've robbed someone famous? I lost a ring, I think it's in the car. What ring? Did you find my cigarettes? That's enough for you to keep me here? Sorry, there has been a robbery and since we couldn't phone you, ...we had to visit. Come in, please. A car was stolen. An Alfa Romeo GT 2000 with number plate RomaK69996 Yes, this is Pier Paolo's. And you are...? His cousin. Wait here, Ill get him. Don't make any noise. His mother is sleeping. Let me untie it first. Where is the bag, Dad? It's there. It's not. - Look in the boot. Dirty and disgusting people. Where do they come from. They're all... Oh, my God. My God. My God. Alfredo, come here. I killed someone. Who? Pasolini. Pasolini. The famous one? Where did they find him? Where? Out. Out. Clear the area. Clear the area. Whose' ball is this? What are you waiting for? Clear this area. Get these people out of here. It seems they've used a plank from this fence. As soon as I came here, I realised it was not garbage, but a corpse. Mr. Moravia, can you make a statement? Not yet. My last name is spelled with two 't': Salvitti. What's your's? I'm Furio Colombo. I work for 'La Stampa'.... 'La Stampa', the Agnellis newspaper. Yes, from Agnelli. - Write that this is disgusting. That it was a gang. They have killed that poor wretch. He was crying for half an hour: 'Mama, Mama, Mama.' They were about 4 or 5 of them. Have you told the police? Do I look like an idiot? Did you tell police you lost a ring? Yes. Why? Come with me. We'll go to the judge. Why do I have to see the judge now? - What kind of ring was it? Gold with a stone. And I had something engraved. - What was written? - Something in English. Only failed to tune in your signature. Can I go? Do you understand? This was found beside the body. This case should not be here. I'm not a juvenile judge Do you know why you have been brought here? Because if you are a minor and have been with other grown-ups... Which grown-ups? - ...this is tried at an ordinary court. Which means you will be judged by a court for adults... ...and without child protection. You'll be judged as an adult, as a true criminal. Were you alone or were there others with you? I was alone. Then, Pasolini came to the Stazione Termini with Alfa. First he spoke with your friends and then he called you, ... you were next to the kiosk at Plaza Esedra. How much money did he offer you to go with him? He didn't talked about money. He just said he would give me a nice gift. Just that. A beautiful gift. But when you came up to the car, did he say what he wanted from you. He only asked me if I had eaten. So, he took me to a restaurant next to the Basilica of San Paolo... ..called 'Trattoria al dente'. But you recognized him? Did you know who he was? It is not possible. Such a famous man. He's in all newspapers and TV. I never watch TV. But there in the restaurant, as a customer... ...was he not welcomed and was he not called by his name. Paolo. They called him Paolo. We stopped outside of Idroscalo. He wanted a blowjob but I didn't do it. Then I got out off the car. I walked to the fence and I saw him coming after me.. He began to touch me and tried to get into my pants. With this crazy look in his face he said: 'I'll kill you', 'I'll kill you'. I fought him back because I did not want to have sex with him. Then he got angry and tried to get his dick up my ass. And he began to beat and punch me. I could not take it anymore. When we were rolling on the ground, I grabbed a wooden stick... ... and hit him with all my strength on his head,... ... in his face and neck, everywhere. I stopped when I saw that he didn't move anymore. I didn't know what to do. His face and hands were full of blood. I got into the car and I drove off. That's all. - There he is ! - Come on, take a picture! - What does he have to say? - What's new ? This case doesn't belong here. I will transfer it to the Juvenile Court. But was Pelosi alone? - Was there no-one else in Idroscalo? You can move now. I have finished here. I'll make the prints. All right. You, take your clothes off. No, just on the floor. We'll pick them up later. It's amazing that after such a fight you don't have any mud on you. I stopped at a fountain to wash my hands and clothes. Water wouldn't remove any bloodstains. Look here. There has to be a stain but there's no sign. Come on, hurry. Do I have to take off my socks? Yes, even your socks. What do you want? Well? - Are you Antonio Pelosi? - Yes, I am. What do you want? Have you received a call from the police tonight? Yes, I have. Been told that your son Pino has been arrested? Yes, I've been told. A prisoner in the Juvenile Detention. Nothing will happen to him. It's not the first time. It's bad luck to have a thief as a son. Your son is charged with murder. Pier Paolo Pasolini lived in a house in Via Eofrae... ...next to his mother and cousin,... ...with a young university-student and some other friends. He was very close to his mother, Mrs. Susanna Pasolini... ...and she also played the role of the Virgin Mary... ..in his film 'The Gospel According to St. Matthew'... Friends say, we wouldn't... ...have want to bring out this chronicle live broadcast... This way personalities... of culture and the world of cinema to pass away. What do you want from me? It's not a good time. Sorry. Not now. Last night you were together in a restaurant? In Pommidoro. But Pier Paolo went home alone, by himself. We both went home. Paolo to his home and I to mine. You have worked a lot with Pasolini, as one of his actors. Can you give us a brief portrait. Who was Pier Paolo Pasolini. He was a person who... you see, I have no words. A great... the greatest person. And above all, a person who was too good for this world. Advocate. Advocate. It's Pasolini's lawyer! Advocate, I'm from Telediario. Courage. Finally. Nino! Who are they? I don't know. From the Police. They want to see Pier Paolo's diary. They wanted to find out if he had an appointment with someone last night. No, you can't do that. - Nino, wait. Calm down. Susanna is with Laura. She still doesn't know. I disconnected radio and TV. I can't tell her. How can we tell her? If I sign this, I will not be able to do anything. We'll find a way. But not now. When then? She doesn't speak or ask anything. It is as if she knows. I can only say that Pier Paolo was uncomfortable for this society... ...and so he has been removed. What else? - I have nothing on Pelosi. Originally from Guidonia. Height 1.71 metre. I would say he is quite athletic. Looks like a nerd. (Pulcino=chicken) A nerd couldn't have killed Pasolini. Have you already found those photos? Damn. Why did this idiot have to get killed on a Sunday? Have you seen the interview with Davoli? He says, Pelosi would not have been able to do it alone. What do we care about Ninetto Davoli? Is he a judge or police? Is he investigating the corpse? Boss. - What is this? - The script of Pelosi's hearing. Congratulations. Very good. This is better than crying Ninetto. A youngster admitted killing Pasolini after a quarrel with the writer, Pelosi said, he first hit his head with a stick, The young man had arrived in Rome the afternoon, to meet some friends. Do you have to listen to this? - Shut up. Let me hear. Then a car came up to me, driven by a man... At first I didn't recognized him. He told me that he was Pasolini. Is he crazy? Why did he say he knew him? Did you heard? He also said that we were at the station? If the police calls, what shall we say? The truth. That we were at the station. What if they ask about the car? Pelosi said that Pasolini escorted him to a restaurant. The youngster also said they stopped on the road to Ostia. Another driver in the area confirmed this. Is this story true about the driver? He is called De Angelis and works in a bar. He says there was no one else. Only the Alfa. No other car. Does that surprise you? Pasolini wanted the boy to go with him. You see? TV only broadcast... the version of the accused, without any balance. Thus, fifty million Italians... believe everything Pelosi said. I understand that. You're right, but... You must immediately make a statement. The press can't be the judge here. - Advocate, please. Such a statement would mean a threat to freedom of expression. I can not do that. You are one of the largest judicial authorities. All I can do in this case is recommend maximum discretion. I guarantee that this will not happen again. You have my word. - What happened to your arm? - I broke it when I fell off my bike. Wasn't that when you fought Pasolini the other night, in the Idroscalo? No. As I said, I broke it a month ago. Look, here I have the evidence. This hasn't had anything to do with Pasolini. And how did you get to the Stazione Termini? By bus. When Pasolini's car approached, did you recognize him right away? Sure. Salvatore even grabbed his arm and asked for a role in his next movie. And I said, 'Look, I...' - Did you tell Pelosi, who he was? You bet. When I saw him getting into the car, I said: 'Be careful, that Pasolini is capable of anything.' Are you sure you said: 'Pasolini'? I think I did,... That's strange. Pino said that he knew, right? How do you know that? It said so on TV. - Television is wrong. How can it be? - Is it Pelosi or you who is lying. Perhaps... ...on second thought, Maybe I didn't tell him straight away... but when he returned half an hour later... Why did he come back? - Because I had to give him the car keys. What Car? Didn't you come by bus? - I meant... ... I had the keys to his house, ... because his jacket didn't have pockets. Then he said that he was going to Idroscalo. No, he didn't say anything. And then what happened? Nothing. He went away. But this time Pasolini did not come back. Do you think after killing someone, he'd take the car from the dead... ...and drive around 160 kilometres per hour like an idiot? Who said he went that fast? They only said... ...they arrested him. So, don't make things up. With a car like that, and not going to drive fast? I don't think, that he has killed anyone. Pino 'the frog' is not capable of that. I say he only stole the car. Someone else killed him. Unless they were on drugs. - What drugs? Anything. Ask Braciola, he knows about these things. What do you mean? He's a pharmacist? Go to hell. And what do you think? What happened between Pelosi and Pasolini? What happened? I don't care. Good morning. I am a journalist. I would like to talk to Ennio Salvitti. What Salvitti, the fisherman? - Where can I find him? The fisherman's gone. At least four of your type came this morning. He has denied everything. He didn't tell your colleagues anything. Here, the article is signed Giulio Colombo. They failed to write that we only tried helped that poor Pelosi. Poor? He killed him. I would give a medal to that poor kid. Do you know what Pasolini wanted from the boy? Would you like that to happen to your son or your brother? He got what he deserved. Go now, go away. Why did he have to die here? Couldn't he've died somewhere else? Leave now, go. A little to the right I was close to Pier Paolo when he was very young. He introduced me to poetry and film. I was his assistant in his first movie, 'Accattone'. I think that this is not a crime... ...against a person or against a brother,... ...but a crime against Art, intelligence and poetry. I don't know his murderers, and neither what they did,... ...but anyway... ...Pier Paolo was telling the truth. Now they have shut him up forever. This is something horrible and monstrous. The Press Office, please. They took the decision to silence him forever. And that deeply disturbs us. As the Secretary of the group 'Social House'... ...consider it my duty to denounce speculations,... ...that the News have been dedicated to help Pier Paolo Pasolini's murder. It is scandalous to say that this murder is a crime against Art. We, and with us, millions of Italians, do not feel represented by the work of Pier Paolo Pasolini. They have only weak arguments. Don't take it too seriously. It will be nothing. It was self defence. What are you supposed to do, when you are attacked? Are the Judges protecting queers? Exactly. Self-defence will give you only a few months. But if you start to talk, you'll be out of here with your feet first. Are you Pelosi's Attorney? Why? Do you know anything? No. Only what I've heard around. He ended pretty badly, poor Pier Paolo. Why? Did you know Pasolini? How couldn't I have? Not personally, of course. Always hanging around with the same car. Then getting old. Whether you are famous or not, it happens to all of us. And that night I saw him in his car going round and round. Then I met a friend and I didn't pay any more attention. Did you see Pelosi, there at Stazione? Maybe, I remember... a handsome guy. But he did not kill Pasolini. Everyone knows that. Yes? The people in control there killed him. They are like a mafia. For some time they had targeted Pasolini. Why? - He asked too many questions. He had been warned twice already. How many? A car followed him for an ambush. Would you tell a Judge all this? Listen to me, please. We protest strongly. We have a right to see Pelosi. We have been appointed. - Sorry, dear Vincenzo. He is Vincenzo, I am Tommaso. - Please forgive me. I meant Tommaso. In any case, no one can see or talk with your client now. Perone, but why not? I prefer that no-one speaks with him before I have questioned him. Hello. Have you heard what the lawyers say about Pelosi? - No, what? They say his confession is unconvincing... ... and that he will be tied as a civil case, represented by Marazzita. 'That Saturday night, Giuseppe Pelosi must have had other helpers.' You see, this is strange. Obviously, they think that he is covering for somebody. Perhaps out of fear. If I had to defend myself and I was... convinced that there were other perpetrators... ...I'd do the same. Show that he was just a simple accessory. So, why does Pelosi insist that he was alone? Because it enables him... to be tried as a minor. He knows that if the judge accepts him as a minor, the case will end quickly. Have you studied Law, Perosi? - No, it is simple experience. The past year he has gotten rid of a charge of robbery, only to be minor. Anyway, as I understand Pier Paolo has hunted the fascists. I don't mean physically, but fascism... ...and the air around us and the horror we breathe in every day. Or, perhaps, he hunted them even physically. Listen. I have no intention starting a political process. No? - No. Why? - Because it is political. You'll see. The first has a history of carrying weapons and so forth. The second is a beginner, but the other day he attacked a passerby. This, attempted murder and robbery. Released after a time. And this is the worst. Me. They're all junkies. People who go cold turkey will kill their own parents to steal a watch. Yes, everything is fine. But what to do with Pelosi? Two of them have been seen in the bar Pelosi usually goes to. Well? What do they have to do with Pasolini ? What do they have to do with Pasolini? Haven't you seen the pamphlets? I kept one as a souvenir. ONE LESS! Cute, right? Remember what I said. I do not want to call a guard. I thought this were the lawyers. What lawyers. Did you hear what they are saying? They say that maybe you were not alone. You know that if you were not alone, if there was... someone else they will give you a life sentence. Never. You haven't slept, right? How am I going to sleep. Watch out. You're hurting me. Like those two. You must change lawyers. Yes, indeed. He agreed to carry Pelosi's defence and I haven't wasted your time. What is this? Books by Pasolini. I read, to learn. First, because it is not my usual habit to demonise anyone. And secondly, because maybe these books contain the mystery of his disease. An erotic paranoia, which, that night at the Idroscalo, led to tragedy. Strange things happen these days. The communists, who want equality... ...asking for special treatment for... Pasolini, only because he was an accomplished artist. The case is clear. Pelosi struck to defend himself. To defend his honour. An absolute tragic outcome, of course. But this desperate outcome is symbolic of the proletariat revolt,... ...the rebels against exploitation a pseudo-libertarian culture. It is very comfortable to go hunting... by driving an Alfa Romeo GT 2000. This process will clear the way for cultural terrorism... ...and show who Pier Paolo Pasolini truly was. May his soul rest in peace. Come on, pull Pasolini's car in. Quick. Come quick. Look what you did! You have to make the autopsy. It's too important and I don't trust anyone else. Sorry, Nino, you can't ask me to do that. Yes, because you're the only one that can do it. Court Administration experts have been unable... to examine the body at the crime scene. They could only see it in the Morgue. The Judge has not yet questioned Pelosi's friends... ...local residents, or the regular users of the station. They have not even made at least one Car expert analysis of Pier Paolo's vehicle. You know that in a trial for minors, the prosecution has only 40 days. We have nothing. - What do you expect from me? I can't do miracles. Tomorrow, at the funeral, all evidence will be buried for ever: …body, investigation and attention of the public opinion…... ...and the words of Pelosi will stay as the only truth. And according to you, what is the truth? So far... ...I have some impressions based only at the first hearing of the boy. The impressions also count. Do you think Pelosi is telling the truth or not? No. I don't think so. It seems too unreal to have happened exactly like this. How do you see this case? - I'm learning. We will not publish any of this. - Why? Too violent and tragic. No-one would believe that the idiot Pelosi did this by himself. Anyway it is better that we keep ahead of our competitors. Okay, let's begin. Two large skin abrasions at the front and side. Bruising on the cheekbone and left jaw. Jaw fracture at two points. Transverse lesion outer ear, left atrium. Right ear injury with the ear nearly torn off. Some finger-edge fractures left hand and a deep cut on thumb. Fracture of the sixth and seventh right rib. On the left side, fracture of the sixth, seventh, eighth... ...and the ninth rib. In summary, ten fractures all together. Capsular wounds in the liver. Was this all featured in the Report to the Court expert? I don't think they had read it. We've lost first and foremost a poet... and in the world there are not so many poets. Only three or four are born every century. At the end of this century, Pasolini is among the very few poets remembered. A poet should be something sacred. The cause of death was fracture in the heart caused by the push of a car. We are done, Paolo. 'Dear Pelosino I received your mail. I've been to Inacasa, but Johnny was not there. 'As soon as I see him, I'll tell him to write to you'. Who is this Johnny? Is he that friend of yours: Johnny, the Gypsy? What do you care? Is it important? Now you're in jail, do not give up and think about what you've done. You have to pretend that nothing happened. Just think one day you will be free and that day is near. Goodbye. Your friend, Braciola. Who the hell is Braciola? The son of Jack the Ripper? This comes from Germany. Do you know anyone there? Four poor fellows who migrated there... ...ten years ago, have made a collection. With all these fans we are going to get rich. There is another version of the death of Pasolini. They killed two motorcyclists. What story is that? Mysterious witness? Who has told Fallaci there were other perpetrators? Is it possible that you are total idiots? Even in a newspaper article we look like idiots. How is this possible? What have we done so far? Where are the expert reports of Pasolini's car? Where are the interviews of those in the Idroscalo? Why hasn't the bar of the Station raided? They had to be here. We know them one by one. Can you tell me why you haven't done any of this ? Why were you on the streets at this hour? Didn't you have rheumatism? What about you? - Yes, of course. I was there by chance, looking for a pharmacy. Did you know Pasolini? Who doesn't? He was a great director. No...I mean, had you seen him before? Sure, on TV and the movies. I mean if you saw him there at the Stazione Termini, where you were. Listen: I told you I was looking for a pharmacy. Stop being a fool, idiot. Have you seen him at the Station? Perhaps one of those other times that you were 'looking for pharmacy'. No. I never saw him there. Good morning, Police. Do you live here? Yes. Have you been questioned? - No, nobody was here. The worst job always comes to us, eh, Professor? Pigna. There are tracks here where the car was. Why wasn't the place sealed? As soon as I arrived, I sealed it. But I was not the first to arrive. But how can we do the research? How can we distinguish the tracks? Look here. And here. And here. And here. It looks like an act of a lunatic. Are you trying to cover up for someone? I'll pretend I didn't hear that. Goodbye, professor. I've told you the story twenty times. I'm sick of it. How did you come to the Stazione? - In my car. Not true. Your friends have said that night you went to the Stazione by bus. So who are you? I'm only going to answer to the judge. I'm the attorney for the family of Pasolini. You're going to have to answer my questions. Is it true? - It's true. Maybe my friends, as I don't have the card, have thought it was a stolen car. However, my colleague, the 850 was acquired legitimate. Here's the bill for the acquisition. - Sure. It cost a lot of money. Where did you get the money from? That's my business. I'm here to talk about Pasolini, not my car. Let's go on. You didn't realize that he was injured by the surface of the car? You did not even think that he could have been alive? So why did you say to your cell-partner that you had killed Pasolini? I said Pasolini, because when the police stopped me, I was told that the car was his. No, I did not asked that. I asked: why did you say: 'I've killed? Because I thought that after that beating and blood and time that had happened... Then you say you gave him... such a beating that he could have been dead. I don't know. I don't know. What kind of questioning is that against the defendant? Are we in the KGB? Come on, calm lawyer. Then, I will formulate the question for you. When you left the place, what did you think? I thought only of getting away. I did not think of Pasolini. I wanted to get away, nothing else. When did the letter from Braciole come? - Sunday. Can you make a copy? - Yes, in the office. I have never supported homosexuals. They are worse than others. In this world, those who treat us badly, we also treat badly. Homosexuals, thieves and murderers are scam. Pasolini, only because he was someone to wrote something, us and the media give him importance. Yesterday I saw the funeral of Pasolini on TV. There were many people, like the President of the Republic. I say it's not fair. The State punishes criminals and thieves. Why then do they honour homosexuals? Homosexuals. Sit. Do you agree? - Sure, he asked for it. He could have stayed in the North and not come to Rome to molest young people. He liked sissies. - No, the hard ones. This is one of his poem on Rome. Listen. 'City great and miserable... '... who showed me how happy men and the wild are teaching children. 'Those little things, which reveal the greatness of life. 'I walk fast and secure in the crowded streets... '...and go to another man without a tremble. 'Not be ashamed to see how the fingers counting money... '...the worker is sweaty... '...with his weathered face in the colour of a perpetual summer. 'City great and miserable... '...you made me to discover a life unknown to me, '...until I discovered that each person was a world.' This was Pasolini... ...and this is what I taught you. Braciola, Calabrone and Johnny, all friends of Pelosi. Keep an eye on them, who they are and what they do. I know Braciola. They are related to the Monarchist Union. Johnny calls him 'The Gypsy' and his parents own a carousel. He left Marmo Jail recently. For a small crime, stealing a bike. Was he in jail at the day of the homicide? No, he was out. Why do you want to know? Forget it. Sit. Sit. Well, ...what is so important? I have a meeting in 10 minutes. What about the report? I've had my eye on that bar for months. The Romans use to gather there. But earlier this year, when the kidnappings and assaults began, the french begun to appear. Here is an important one. His name is Gilles Marcel. His two main activities are dressing as a women and selling drugs. Inside his bag, a kilo of heroin. We arrested him an hour ago. The National Vanguard is: Black Terrorist, suspected for bombing. Continue. National Vanguard and New Order... ...which is the same as saying that the fascists... are using bombs, have joined... ...and now call themselves 'Popular Struggle.' They are financed by kidnapping, robbery and drug trafficking. And the evidence? Where are they? This one here called Luigi Mariano, a banker... in Brindisi was kidnapped several months ago. And behind all of this is Concutelli, military commander of the Black Terrorists. The conclusion is that Rome is like Chicago, right? No. The conclusion is that the fascists and the underworld are allied. And now they do the assaults, kidnappings and drug trafficking together. Before the fascists only recruited people for beatings, Now they ask for other things, like killing, making bombs and worse... ...like murdering Pasolini. I do not make silly arrests, just because you have... some ideas about the fascists and... ...and all that crap without any evidence. You have nothing. Is this a report? So you work here? It seems that one is reading 'L'Unita'. That is to childish. Now, draw a picture of yourself. Did you forget your hands. Didn't they teach you to draw on the College? Sorry, wait a minute. Let him at least finish. What did you mean when you said? That he is a savage, a beast? That everybody already knows. He is a monster, right? And you, how do you judge your child's behaviour? And how should I? Don't you understand you have to survive? You mean that Pino did well doing that? - Whoever did wrong was Pasolini. He should have stayed writing poetry. Because I stay in my house, when I return at night, dead tired. To me these things have never happened. How do you feel about what your father says? What do you mean, feel about? Does it seem normal to you what you have done? I don't know. In short, of everything that happened, is there anything... you wish wouldn't have happened? Yes, of course. - What? The newspapers wrote it is their fault. It is not their fault that I'm what I am. - Like what? You know.... Is there anything else that you dislike? - They call me 'Frog'. I've got this nickname in the newspapers. Do I have a frog face? There are guys who have seen me on TV and... they say that they dream of me, not a frog. Death. Say another word for it. To finish everything. And birth? I can't think of anything. Well? - More work. Work, Luigi? I would have preferred to see you tomorrow. Why tomorrow? We have no time to lose. Give me this. Listen, Nino. Sorry to bring bad news but I think, he is immature. What? Immature? - Immature. What do you mean, he has killed a man. Even a five year old child knows, that taking someone's life is something that... Yes, I know. But he... no... doesn't even know that... He has no moral. Conditions where he has lived so far... Stop with this psychological bullshit. For you even Cain would be innocent. You realize that if the Court accepts him as immature, he'll be free the next day. Yes, I know. If you want, you can always ignore... the expert report. Of course. I won't submit this. Andreotti, Fanfani, Rumour and at least one dozen other powerful Democrats... ...should be taken prisoners. And being processed for a number of crimes: bribes about oil with industry and bankers, ...collaboration with the CIA, illegal use of secret information, responsibility in the massacres of... ...Milan, Brescia and Bologna... ...by landscape destruction and urban Italy, ...for their role in the anthropological degradation of the Italians, ...and by the wild explosion of mass-culture and media... ...and for their role in TV criminality. Without criminal proceedings they come to believe... you can do anything in our country. And it seems clear that the respectability of some Democrats... ...or the morals of the Communists has been good for nothing. August 28, 1975 Pier Paolo Pasolini Pasolini wanted to prosecute all. And you know why? Because he wanted revenge on all criminal proceedings initiated against him. Pasolini. How persecuted was he? What kind of a victim or a monster built by the Press. Where are the facts? October 15, 1949, arrested for the first time for corruption of minors. January 1, 1951, Chioggia: arrested for drunkenness. July 21, 1955: Taken to Court by Judicial Council of Milan... ...for pornographic contents in his book 'Young Life'. Doctor, your toga. All right, put it on the bed and try not to wrinkle it. Today we'll have all of the TV-stations and must look good. You can go, Gara. February 9, 1960: arrested for the sad facts of Via di Panico. July 16, 1960, Anzio: reported for corruption of minors. November 18, 1961: reported for assault with a deadly weapon. Over 30 cases has the man had against him and he always came out innocent. Everything went up in smoke. But, gentlemen, where there's smoke, there's fire. On the 2nd of February 1976, ...the Juvenile Court composed of Dr. Alfredo Carlo Moro, President, Dr. Giuseppe Psalm, Judge Dr. Matteo Guarino, court fees, Dr. Maria Grazia Milone, Honorary Judge. With intervention of the Public Ministry, represented by... the prosecutor, Dr. Giuseppe Santarsiero... ...and with the assistance of the Subscribed Chancellor, Dr. Roberto Carnevali, meets the Board of Hearing, to discuss the criminal case... ...of the preliminary investigation against Giuseppe Pelosi, accused. The defendant is assisted by Attorney Rocco Mangia. The civil Court, Susanna Pasolini, has already been established... ...and represented by their lawyers, Antonio Marazzita and Guido Calvi. Being a minor, the case will take place behind closed doors. I confirm everything I said and I have nothing to add. It couldn't been said better. ...but I have some questions. Ah, yes. Sorry, president, could I... The defendant requests that his mother leaves... the room during questioning. The Court accepts this request. Please, ma'am. The will call you, as soon as possible. When you went to the Piazza, to the kiosk, did you know that there were men, who...? Yes, I knew. And that night, had you planned to go with any of these men? Yes. Have you had done it before? - No, never. That night was the first time. Because I needed the money. Important needs, I guess. I needed it for a car. Was there any other reason to behave in this way? Some guys do it as a women, but I wanted to do it as a man. I wanted to see if doing it with a man would disgust me. And your reaction came when you were asked for oral sex? I resisted at first. - But this is absurd. Then why did you go with the man? And why did you not say this in previous hearings? Mr President, he is trying to intimidate the defendant. Attorney Mangia, I assure you that I wouldn't allow this. Please sit down. Do you understand the question? Why do you say now that you resisted? What's wrong if I agree first and then change my mind? I left the car and I thought it was over. I only got into his car, to see what it was like. He came after me and started to touch me. I told him to stop because I did not want to do it as a woman. He picked up a piece of wood and wanted to... use it on me. I said: 'Are you crazy?' Then he started to beat me with that stick. I kicked him and tried to run away. He ran after me and jumped on top of me. He kept beating me, I grabbed the stick and started to hit him. But then the stick broke. I pulled some wood off the fence and hit him on the head with force. I was in shock, with my face and hands covered with blood. I could not see anything. So I got into his car and drove off. If you were together at a restaurant, you must have talked, right? He was speaking. - About what? I don't know? Where he worked, where he lived;... which school he went to and things like that. Was it nice? - Yes, it was. It was nice at that time. But later, when you left the Idroscalo, what happened then? In your previous interviews, you said that he seemed to have crazy eyes. What did you mean by that? I repeat the question. - I understood the question. I don't know? Have you heard? You know what they've done these idiots? What? After the meeting the other day, they raided the bar where I was researching. Arrested ten people who had nothing to do with it. They spoiled six months of my work. Yes, because... Because they're idiots and Fuckheads. Who finds the fascists and those from Marseille now? Calm down. They took me off the case. I have been transferred. They call it a promotion. Because I found a picture of Braciola, the friend of Pelosi. He's on here. But you'll have to find him yourself. It could be a good clue. Why do you do that? I don't handle this case any longer. I too have been 'upgraded'. Why have you told of this? This is only a hypothesis. Perhaps. No one else would have said it. It had to be me. Do you think that perhaps some of... the extreme right, linked to the underground, would have...? I do not believe anything. I have given the information as is. You have to do the thinking. Are you saying they interfered with the research? I have to go. Goodbye. Good luck. No, Pier Paolo never removed his glasses. Not even at home. Not for a moment. You can assume that he wouldn't have left his car without wearing them. Do you recognize this jersey and these in-soles? No, the jersey is not Pier Paolos. I don't know to whom it belongs. Could they not have been in the car for a longer time? I washed the car the day before. That same afternoon, Pier Paolo came back. I'm sure that they were not there. Maybe they were in the trunk. - Absolutely not. I also cleaned the trunk and there was no jersey or in-soles. But do they belong to the boy? No, not to him. We've checked. I did not want to kill him. He forced me to. I did not want to kill him. It was an accident. Silence. Can you tell us where exactly you found this jersey? On the back seat, I think. But the investigating experts say they found it in the trunk. It is possible that someone has moved it. Please try to be as accurate as possible. It does matter if the thing was in the trunk or back seat. In the trunk, it could be simply cloth. But in the back seat, since it didn't belonged to the victim... or the accused, we could assume that, Maybe there was... a third person in the car. It was on the back seat. - Thanks. You can go. Are you Pugliese? - And who are you? We have an appointment. - I don't think so. Don't you have an appointment with Braciole? Is it you? - Sure. And my brother, Bracioletta. Go to hell. - You go to hell. What's all this? I have a job to be done and I need 2 guys. And they sent two amateurs. You are amateur. Do you understand? - Do not worry. Listen, let's leave it. - Wait. Not so fast. How much money are we talking? Ten grand a head. But only if you can work this. Do you think I'm afraid? Bye. Come back when you're a little older. Who do you think you're talking to? You are talking to the Pasolini killers. What do you mean? If you want someone like Pasolini killed, you need me Motherfucker. Who would call you? - And why the fuck do you care? What the hell do I care? What are you doing, dammit. Hey, put the gun down. I knew he was an under-cover cop. Signed 'Braciola'. Did you write this? Why? Is it forbidden to write a friend in jail? So you know Pelosi well. - So what? Here you talk about a mutual friend a certain Johnny, 'The Gipsy'. What about Jonny? He killed to steal a watch. He has confessed to it. Johnny is not bad. It's just, that night he was a little stoned. Perhaps he was too high when he lent a hand to Pelosi. I told you everything is a lie. So why did you tell the police, that you killed Pasolini that night? I don't know. Because... What do you mean 'because?' I did nothing. I only said it... ...for, well, to be important. And now? Why did you retract everything? Mom, go away. I don't want you to be in the newspapers. Take a photo of me. I am more handsome than Pino. Nothing so far differs... even slightly from Pino Pelosi's version. None of the three friends' versions... differ from Stazione's, only that they lied about arriving in a car... ...they thought was stolen. Media revelations only created confusion. This latest farce of the two brothers to criminalised themselves... is just as important to their fellow adventurers. May I ask, Mr. President, can we now go to what really matters? Let us establish for once and for all... whether or not it was homicide. Let's see if Pelosi is immature, or are we wasting our time? Indeed, Mr. President, for this purpose, ...here is the psychiatric report of the civil court. I submit this to this Court. According to our expert, Pelosi must be regarded as immature. We could have stopped to let this report out. But, look, Mr. President, we believe what we can learn... ...from Pier Paolo was his passionate love for truth. We would be of disservice to his memory, if we settled for less. We disagree with the evaluation of our expert... but we would be wrong if we did not submit that report. The Alfa Romeo 2000 GT was standing next to the fence by the football field. This is the area of the incident. A wide open area, as you can see. Here at this point, about 70 meters away, Pasolini's body was found. But it was here, next to the car, where the first attack took place. And it was here where his shirt was found. In the first phase, Pasolini was violently beaten on the head... ...and the wounds begin to bleed abundantly. This is proofed by... ...the blood found on the shirt. Look at it. It's not torn anywhere. If Pasolini himself took the shirt off during the attack. We would have found clogged blood. What could have caused a blood-loss of this magnitude? If we believe Pelosi's testimony, that this plank, which is marked 'Buttinelli', ...giving us the name of the owner of this house... ...came from the exact point where the body was found. Pelosi himself admitted that this plank... was only used at the end of fight. The only other heavy object he admits to having used... is this. A fragile stick... ...which would have been destroyed after the first strike. So how can a stick of this size cause such serious injury? It is impossible. Therefore, it is logical at the first phase, another heavy object... or another aggressor had to be present to carry out those blows. The wounds found on Pasolini's head, ...are in an area largely supplied by capillaries, ... and would usually cause a haemorrhage, ...in which blood gushes violently outwards... ...every time the heart pumps. So at the end of what Pelosi calls man-to-man fight... ...Pasolini's body was completely covered with blood and mud. Pino Pelosi, however, at the time of his arrest... ...didn't have a trace of Pasolini's blood on him, There was only blood on this sweater. He had traces of his own blood on his shirt... and some stains of Pasolini's blood on the right leg of his pants. Nothing else. - But I had a cut here. Yes, indeed, ...the boy had a small head injury,... ...but this injury was a clean cut... ...without abrasion or bruising. A wound, which could not have been produced by a stick or wooden board. And now? - Very simple. When chased by the police car,... Pelosi was forced to stop abruptly. During the impact, he hit his head against the roof, ...which indeed was found stained with his blood. So, what are you saying? - Silence. The accused is not allowed to interrupt. You may only speak when asked. Go on, professor. Pelosi's version of events seem therefore unlikely true. How is it possible to cause Pasolini's injuries with a plank of rotted wood? How is it possible that after this dramatic man-to-man fight, he described... ...he was not covered in blood and mud? I had a wash at the fountain. If this was true, then at the time of arrest, he would have been soaked. There is no mention of that in the police report. This is outrages. It was like I said. We have already heard your statement. If you continue to interrupt, I will remove you from this Court. I apologise, Mr. Chairman, it will not happen again. So far it seems possible for us to outline, ...a reconstruction on those facts. Shortly after midnight, Pier Paolo Pasolini and Pino Pelosi arrive at Idroscalo by car. The car stops at the bottom of the football field. They start talking. The writer takes off his glasses and puts them down in the car, ...which we later found there. Pelosi also places a pack of cigarettes and lighter there. But these, inexplicably, were not found. It is then when oral sex took place. Then, Pelosi says he left the car and was followed by Pasolini. ...He says: 'just to have a look.' For what? It is total darkness and Pasolini didn't put his glasses back on, which, according to his cousin Graziella Chiarcossi,... ...he never took off. Everything indicates that the writer did not leave the car by his own choice, ...but was pulled out by force... ...and with extreme violence. Pasolini is wounded and bleeding heavily. But he is still alive... ...and in a position to remove his shirt to protect his wounds. If they only wanted to teach him a lesson, this would have been enough. But this was only the beginning of a massacre. The autopsy revealed, Pasolini... ...testicles were violently traumatised and bruised. If this trauma had occurred in the first phase, as Pelosi claimed... ...it would have prevented Pasolini from any defence reaction. Not allowing him therefore to get up, take off his shirt... ...and walk about 70 meters. I ask you now to put your attention on this photo. This photo was not available to my colleagues who did a previous autopsy. I leave it up to you to decide on the reasons... for this incredible omission. I can only say... ...that the omission of this photo... has led my colleagues to miss out... on the injuries inflicted by the car. If they had studied this photo... ...they would have realised that Pelosi's statement... did not respond to the truth. Look carefully at this. These marks of the left tire... ...clearly show what happened to the poet's body. And to clear any doubt, I asked a car tyre expert. As you can see... ...they match. Therefore, the car ran over Pasolini. It didn't follow this track, ...then it could have been accidental. Instead it continued here. And why did the car make this absurd curve? Because the driver wanted to crush the body? I do not know if that was what Pino Pelosi wanted. I do not know if he was driving the car at the time of the collision, ...but the murderer was. Pelosi was there... ...and his participation is certain. He says he stopped at a fountain to wash the blood off his hands. Why then, hasn't the steering wheel of the car been stained? He said that Pasolini's blood on the roof of the car... ...were left by his bloody hands. But he forgot that the stains were found in the passenger's... ...and not the driver's side. Only two scenarios are possible. Either Pelosi's hands were stained... with blood from the passengers side... ...while someone else was driving. Or an accomplice with bloody hands sat in the passenger's seat... ...while Pelosi, whose hands were not blood-stained, was driving the car. In either case... ...it seems clear that someone else, who had participated in the aggression, ....must have got into the car with Pelosi. Not true. Not true. - Quiet or you'll leave the court. I maintain that the thorough examination of all evidence, ...the club, table, clothes and Pasolini's injuries, ...invalidate Pelosi's story, and show what really happened. We have to conclude this case on the basis that Pasolini... ...was the victim of a crime involving several persons. It's a conspiracy. A conspiracy. They have invented everything. Everything. This is outrageous. A farce. I don't know how to thank you for all you've done... ...and going to continue to do. But,... ...I don't know how to explain, ...I feel such a loss and much less strong. It happened to all of us. We all have lost something priceless. Indeed Guido, something priceless. What if the Court requests a Civil trial? They will calculated the damages. And how much was Pier Paolo's life worth? What do you do, Graziella? I don't want anything from Pelosi. That's how I feel. Pier Paolo would have been horrified. We can ask for 1 lira. Just symbolic, to allowing us to continue the case. Graziella is right. We have given the Court all the evidence needed. And it makes no sense to ask for compensation. Do not ask anything. We don't have to explain our decision. This is important. - But it is a huge risk. If we retreat now, we can't be present in later phases of trial. Nor can we appeal, in case the sentence is unjust. Wait a minute. Yes, sure. We don't participate any longer or make our voice heard. That's a risk we must take. Instead be the voice of Pier Paolo: ...his books, his ideas. Try to do what he had done. Is this what you meant? We want Pelosi convicted. But his penalty will be insignificant and it is impossible to evaluate... ...because Pelosi is subjected... ...to this Juvenile Court. While Pasolinis memory belongs to all of us, because it belongs to another reality. With these words, Mr. President, the family of Pasolini like to inform... ...of their intends to withdraw their participation of the... civil court and doesn't ask for any compensation. In our view, execution of the murder... ...and the plurality of the executing have been demonstrated. But we can, ...from the moment we decide to abandon this process, ...remember what we all lost the night of November 2, 1975. That night, in which the heart of Pier Paolo Pasolini stopped beating; ...his eyes to reveal... ...and his conscience to judge. Do you have a light? Pasolini has been defined many times as a provocateur. Perhaps because in recent times he had intensified his interventions, ...acting more decidedly against his opponents, ...increasing his list of friends... ...but above all, those who were his enemies. And I will read here what Pier Paolo wrote on November 14, 1974. I know the name of the responsible for the tragedy in Milan... ...the December 12, 1969. I know the names of those who are responsible for the tragedies... in Brescia and Bologna in 1974... I know the names of those who have given the orders... to the generals, the young neo-fascist and the common criminals. I know all names and all facts and all attacks... against the aforementioned. I know, but I have no evidence. In the same way we know all who are... ...behind this crime, ...those who ordered and executed Pasolini's murder. As the crowd said Goodbye to him with pain and anger, at his funeral. That crowd knew and knows it. But like us, they don't have any evidence. The Court. Today, on April 26, 1976, ...the Court accepted the fact that Pelosi actually made... the crimes he was charged with. I accordance with articles 483 and 488, the Court declares Giuseppe Pelosi, guilty for voluntary manslaughter, together with others unknown. And considering him mature and therefore fully liable, ...convicted and sentenced to 9 years 7 months and 10 days in jail. 9 years? Are you crazy? THE PUBLIC PROSECUTOR DOES NOT ACCEPT... 'TOGETHER WITH OTHERS UNKNOWN' This is an extremely serious fact and it changes everything. The prosecution does not oppose the verdict, only 'with others unknown.' That is precisely the point. The boy is of nobody's interest. What is not acceptable is the participation of others. The Attorney General is entitled to oppose a non-convincing sentence. But if it hadn't been published... no-one would be expected to know the reasons. Why the rush? There's no explanation? - The explanation is simple. The Tribunal was so convinced of the presence of... others they have changed the original charges. Pelosi is not only guilty of murder, but of collaboration with strangers. But how? This is something that involves opening new research. It seems clear that they do not want to make further inquiries. And why would that be so bad? - Because the version of Pelosi, ...the poor boy who kills a degenerate, suits many. Who are they? Look, I do not know who killed Pasolini. There could have been all kinds: robbers, kidnappers, ...fascists who wanted to teach a lesson... ...or maybe some of those who had been charged. All the powerful and well known corrupt politicians, whom he accused. Advocate, don't be childish. Do you really think someone from the top... ...would be able to order Pasolini's death? It was not necessary. There are crimes that have impunity. There is such a hostility around the victim, ...that one is able to escape unpunished. Then, there is no doubt and there is a plot... to silence the voice of an opponent. Quite the contrary. I do not have any truth. You are the ones who have doubts. So you are convinced that there can appear things... so greasy, that challenges the sentence... to avoid further investigations. You think that it may involve fascist Secret Service or someone even higher. It is not me who thinks so, you are. THE CONVICTION OF PELOSI WAS CONFIRMED IN APPEAL AND ABROGATION. THE PRESENCE OF UNKNOWN WAS CONSIDERED 'IMPROBABLE'. NEVER MADE NEW RESEARCH. 'Intelligence will never have weight ever, '...for the trial of this public opinion. 'Even on the blood of concentration camps, you get... '...one of the millions of souls our nation... '...a fair trial, full indignation. 'Every idea is unrealistic and every passion is unreal, '...to this separated nation for centuries, '...whose mild wisdom lets them to live, but never be released. 'To show my face and my fragility, ...or raise my voice only, childish, no longer makes sense. 'Cowardice has accustomed us to see others to die in the most terrible way, '...with a strange indifference. 'I'm dying and it hurts me'.
