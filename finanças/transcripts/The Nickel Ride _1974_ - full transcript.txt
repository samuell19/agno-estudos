How much does it make us know each other? Ten or fifteen years? Tears are useless. Nobody is going to touch you. Nobody is going to bother you. Go on a trip. Take the sun When you return to the city everything will have been forgotten. What kind of store are you going to open? I thought about sports articles, balls, gloves, bats and that. Maybe until fishing tackle and baits. Maybe I'm going to buy you something. - Cu date. - Thanks, Coop. - Hi, Coop. - Hi, Phil. Term nalo later. Yes. Yes, of course. Are you ready to talk, Elias?

The elections are approaching, the department is nervous. There are many nervous people. 85,000 will not be enough. Not for something so big. I could get another 5,000. Coop, you want things Do they do well? What to do calmly? We will need, at least, another 15,000. 15,000? Not talking! Try it with 75,000. I could dress them with 10,000, maybe. 10,000, nothing more.

Hi, Mr. Cooper, I waited to see him. I know it's busy, but I'm dying to see him in action. As Mr. Carl said, "the school It's in continuity. " Demons! I am a great observer, I learn fast. I will not have to repeat anything. Should I take a tape recorder? I have many questions. I want to work on my diction. Look at all that pasta. I would get pimples only with smelling it. What do you think? Mr. Carl sent me a guy that made me a good deal Good place to hunt deer. If you want to play with that, play outside. No offense. It's a gift from birthday for my brother. A kind of surprise. There are the keys. How does it feel to take with you a piece of the city? Well well. Leave them. I just wanted to feel it. I work a lot that, extrasensory perception. The vibrations and all that. Close the door behind you. It is funny. You guys smaller than I thought. I imagined a guy older and bigger. What else did you think? Many things, assumptions ... As its appearance. Without a doubt it is much lower. But things are presented easy, people talk. Of what? That he does not talk much. Maybe he should also Learn to be quiet. You see? You are already turning you smarter. It's useless, I'm a born charlatan. Do you want to know something about me? Yes, wait here. Wait here Soon a bus will come. S bete en l, s very polite. Turn arround. - Coop, get yourself a suit. - No, not today. Hey, let's get rid of of the cowboy. Never shut up I had it and you too. It's harmless. Keep it busy, c√©mprale a horse. If you want to be healthy, You have to be in shape. How long I've done today, Bobby? 25, Carl. Do you hear that? 25, each length add a minute to my life. Other time less? Not much. Less is less, Coop. Each time decreases more. I will increase it. I've been saying that since two or three years ago. This damn city is dying. It dries up, like a body. Sections drown to death. Bobby, prepare the car. Do you want to hear something fun? This will really like you. Do you know who will always lose? Tonozzi, that's it. He has broken his legs. Look at that brightness. Have you had any ring like that? Do you know how he got it? For this you will have to think a lot. Another friend of yours. From 58 59. Any idea? Do you surrender? I'll tell you That guy will not get up anymore he will not sit down. In fact, now it's lying very still. It's in a car, in a parking lot. Quiet. Very, very quiet. Good evening, Paulie. Wrap it up, wrap it up. Let's go. Apri talo well. I can not. Come on, more tight. Good God! Paulie! What can I try? if it's already done? That's it, tighter. That Bobby, that son of a bitch. I should have destroyed him. I'm getting old I'm getting slow I should have hit him fast. A quiet, slow guy. I'll fix your face There are things that you have to see what will happen Close the door. Good evening, sir. I hope you like roses. They call me Turner. Is Mr. Cooper? Sorry to bother you, sir, ... ... but Mr. Carl he wants to see you in his office. Why did not you call me? Mr. Carl wanted that came to look for him, ... ... so I came as fast as I could. Wait in the hall. I work with Mr. Cooper. He has a good man. He is a great man. I never thought that I would get a job so fast. The jobs are difficult to find, at least for me. Mr. Carl was generous by letting me drive for him. But you should thank him to you, Mr. Cooper. I should do it, yes, sir. He beat Bobby good. It is what is said an incapacitated He should have let me do it, I would have made it permanent. Do you know? You look a lot like my old man, quiet. But he knew a lot, that old man. Yes, sir, it looked in his eyes. I died a couple of years ago. I would like it Could you see me now? You would have well taken with him. He used to look at me and say: "Son, you're a cowboy from Cadillac. " Now I just have to get me a Cadillac. Safe and sound. There is no bathroom in all this damn building? - Yes, there. - Thank you. Where is Carl? I do not know He told me I brought it here. Are you hungry? Do not. It used to be fast, impersonal. Even so, I like it your style, Turner. T o, you are wild. He has strange ideas, but I like them. I really like them. Crazy, like old times. Ideas for fairground, of monsters show, of carnival. The wild man of the carnival, That is what it is. Surely you can tell stories. About those dancers of carnival. You know, those with tassels on the hips. Go ahead, ladies and gentlemen ... ... see the dancers move the tassels. Surely you could tell me Stories, Mr. Cooper. Surely he could. It would be better if I left. I'll wait for you downstairs. I hope everything is fine, Mr. Cooper. That is, if you need something, anything, do not hesitate. I really mean it. They will pay 10,000 of extra. Try to make it less, but they will pay. It has cost me, but I have succeeded. They will give you an answer this weekend. I will get it. It will be better than I do. Bobby is in the hospital. That was a mistake. Paulie belongs to the past. It's done, okay? The only concern It is the pressure. You are like a computer that does not We can allow it to break down. Good weekend. I had never done the suitcases so fast. I hope I have not forgotten anything. Close that door and we go. Get down What's up, Coop? What happens? The business is finished. New people, new faces. Things change. Blood. Things change. I'm sorry, Georgia. I'm tired, you know?
