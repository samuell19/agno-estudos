I CAN'T MARRY YOU, ABE. YOU'RE NOT... YOU'RE NOT OVER HIM YET, ARE YOU? WELL... WE'RE ALL OVER HIM... LIKE 6 FEET OVER HIM. MOM? BUT IT WAS AN ACCIDENT OR SELF-DEFENSE. I WOULD NEVER KILL ANYBODY ON PURPOSE, OR, LIKE, IN COLD BLOOD. DID YOU EVER SEE THAT MOVIE? SHH, SHH, SHH. LET'S GET SOME REST, O.K.? YOU DON'T WANT TO MARRY ME NOW, DO YOU? SHH. WE'RE TOGETHER NOW. WE'RE TOGETHER. AND THAT'S NOT CHANGING. OH, SHE LOOKS SO THIN. LOOK AT YOU, HONEY! OH! THEY GAVE US A TERRIBLE MAP AT HERTZ. I HAVE BEEN DRIVING AROUND FOR AN HOUR AND A HALF. THIS YOUR HOUSE? OH!

ANYWAY, UM, JANE CALLED ME AT WORK. WANTS TO KNOW HOW YOU ARE. I'M FINE. WHO'S JANE? JANE LIVED HERE UP UNTIL A FEW DAYS AGO. THIS IS BETWEEN ME AND JANE. SHE ASKED FOR MY ADVICE, SO I TOLD HER SHE'S ANTILESBIAN. I AM NOT. WHO'S A LESBIAN? JANE IS. AND SHE WAS LIVING HERE? YES, MA'AM. I AM NOT ANTILESBIAN. NOT YOU. HER. WHO? JANE. THIS IS HER OLD PROBLEM. SHE CREATES A SITUATION WHERE SHE GETS THIS REJECTION. SHE JUST WASN'T BEING HONEST. IT'S A BLACK THING, TOO. JANE IS BLACK? YES, MA'AM. SHE SURE IS. AND YOU CAN'T LIVE A LIE. YOU JUST CAN'T. WELL, THERE'S LYING, AND THERE'S JUST NOT TELLING. BIG DIFF. SHE'S A BLACK LESBIAN? YES, MA'AM. THAT IS RIGHT. AND SHE WAS LIVING HERE... WITH YOU? NO, NO, NO. SHE WAS JUST LIVING HERE. THEY WEREN'T, LIKE, FUCKING OR ANYTHING. WERE YOU? WERE YOU? WERE YOU? I'LL GET THE COFFEE. I HAVE TO GET GOING, BABE. WHY? YOUR SHIFT DOESN'T START TILL 10:30. DON'T YOU WANT TO GO UPSTAIRS FOR A WHILE? OH, NOT TONIGHT. IT WAS NICE MEETING YOU, MA'AM. YOU GOING ALREADY? WE HAVE DESSERT. MAYBE NEXT TIME. THANK YOU. WELL, GOOD NIGHT. ROBIN. GOOD NIGHT. MAYBE I'M JUST TOO FAT NOW. DON'T WORRY, DEAR. IT'S A NATURAL THING. WILL THEY LIVE HERE AFTER THEY GET MARRIED? WHO? HOLLY AND, UH... OH, THAT NICE YOUNG MAN. WHAT IS HIS NAME? OH, ABE. UM... I'M NOT SURE SHE WANTS TO MARRY HIM. A PREGNANT GIRL? IS SHE CRAZY? SHE SHOULD GRAB HIM. WELL... IT'S NOT REALLY HIS BABY. SO WHAT? SHE STILL SHOULD GRAB HIM. BELIEVE ME, I KNOW WHAT SHE'LL HAVE TO GO THROUGH. YOU KNOW, I'M A FEMINIST, TOO. I WAS A SINGLE MOTHER AFTER YOUR FATHER LEFT. YOU THINK THAT WAS EASY? I EVEN VOTED FOR CARTER TWICE. BUT YOU CAN'T FIGHT NATURE. GOD KNOWS YOU GIRLS KEEP TRYING, TREATING YOUR MEN LIKE SIDE DISHES YOU STICK A FORK IN WHEN NEEDED, JUST LIKE MEN TREATED US. MOTHER, WHO AM I TREATING? DO YOU SEE A MAN HERE ANYWHERE? NO. I DON'T. AND I THINK IT'S A PROBLEM. I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY YOU DON'T COME HOME. I LIKE IT HERE, MOM. IT'S SO STRANGE. YOU'RE NOT EXACTLY BUBBLING OVER WITH HAPPINESS. IT'S A LIFE, MOM, NOT A HAYRIDE. HONEY, WHAT IS THIS? OH, MY GOSH. THE POLICE ARE HERE. YES, I SEE THE POLICE, MOTHER. WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON? HOLD IT. OH. O.K. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? I CALLED HER. I THOUGHT SHE SHOULD KNOW. KNOW WHAT? HE'S ARRESTING ME. WHAT FOR? YOU KNOW WHAT FOR, ROBIN. PITTSBURGH. YOU TOLD HIM? YES. I TAKE THIS NAME SERIOUSLY. I CANNOT TELL A LIE. THAT WAS WASHINGTON, SCHMUCK. WELL, WHATEVER. ANYWAY, I'M GOING TO STAND BY HOLLY 100%, BUT I'M SWORN TO UPHOLD THE LAW. I DON'T BELIEVE I'D BE ANY USE TO HER IF I BROKE MY OATH. HE REALLY LOVES ME. OH, YEAH. I CAN TELL BY THE MANACLES ON YOUR WRISTS. RIGHT THIS WAY, MISS. DON'T SAY A WORD, NOT TO ANYBODY. WE'LL GET YOU A LAWYER. I'LL MISS YOU GUYS. I PROMISE YOU THEY'RE GOING TO TREAT HER RIGHT. THEY KNOW THAT SHE'S GOING TO BE MY FUTURE WIFE. SON OF A BITCH. HONEY, WHAT IN THE WORLD IS GOING ON? I FEEL LIKE I'VE SEEN AMERICA'S MOST WANTEDIN PERSON. THIS HAS GOT TO BE THE MOTHER. JANE, PLEASE. YES, I AM. AND WHO ARE YOU? THE LESBO WHO LIVED HERE TILL YOUR DAUGHTER THREW ME OUT. WELL, I'M SORRY. MOTHER. I THINK THIS MAKES HER REAL HAPPY 'CAUSE NOW SHE'S GOT THE HOUSE ALL TO HERSELF. CUT IT OUT. YOU'RE JUST BEING MEAN. JANE, STOP. SHE'S GOING TO NEED OUR HELP. NO, NOT OUR HELP. I'LL TAKE CARE OF THIS. O.K. O.K. FINE. FINE, FINE, FINE, FINE. THEY DO THAT NOW, DON'T THEY? WHAT? CALL THEMSELVES LESBOS. OH, MOM. AND SHE MAKES IT SOUND LIKE A COMPLIMENT. SHE WANTS TO CONFESS. SHE DOESN'T WANT TO BRING HER CHILD INTO A WORLD OF LIES. YOU HAVE NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT, HENRY. HOLLY HAS PROMISED ME SHE'LL KEEP HER MOUTH SHUT AS LONG AS SHE DOESN'T HAVE TO LIE. WE WOULDN'T EVEN BE HERE IF IT WASN'T FOR YOU. I TOOK AN OATH, JANE. AND NOW WE'RE STUCK IN PITTSBURGH. HOLLY'S ON TRIAL 'CAUSE OF YOUR OATH. SO WHAT EXACTLY DO THEY HAVE? NOTHING, EXCEPT FOR ABE'S TESTIMONY, AND THAT'S JUST HEARSAY. THAT IS THE TRUTH. SHUT UP. NOBODY WANTS TO HEAR THE TRUTH. BUT ASIDE FROM THAT, WHAT DO THEY HAVE? THEY--THEY HAVE THE POLAROID. THE POLAROID? YES. I MENTIONED THAT I HAD SEEN A SNAPSHOT. IT'S ON THE LIST OF EXHIBITS. WHAT CAN THEY DO WITH THAT? COLD CRUEL? INHUMAN? WHAT WORDS WOULD YOU USE TO DESCRIBE THE WOMAN WHO POSED AND TOOK THIS PHOTOGRAPH? THIS IS A PHOTOGRAPH... OF A MAN WHO IN A FEW SHORT HOURS WILL BE DEAD FROM WOUNDS INFLICTED BY THIS WOMAN YOU SEE BEFORE YOU. AND NOT SURPRISINGLY, EVERYTHING THAT YOU SAY TENDS TO EXONERATE YOUR FRIEND. SORRY. IT'S THE TRUTH. PERHAPS NOT COINCIDENTALLY, IT TENDS TO EXONERATE YOU. THERE ARE NO CHARGES AGAINST ME. YET. OH, COME ON. YOUR HONOR, IS HE ALLOWED TO INTIMIDATE ME LIKE THIS? MR. MASSARELLI, PLEASE. I APOLOGIZE, YOUR HONOR. IT WAS UNINTENTIONAL. WHAT IS THE NATURE OF YOUR FRIENDSHIP WITH HOLLY PULCHIK? EXCUSE ME? I'M SORRY. LET ME REPHRASE THE QUESTION. HOW WOULD YOU CHARACTERIZE YOUR FRIENDSHIP? I WOULD CALL HER MY FRIEND. I MEAN, COME ON. WHAT IS THIS FRIENDSHIP STUFF? I'M TRYING TO FIND OUT. LET ME PUT THIS DELICATELY TO AVOID OFFENDING THE COURT. IS THERE A ROMANTIC CHARACTER TO YOUR FRIENDSHIP? OBJECTION. OVERRULED. YOU MAY PROCEED, MR. MASSARELLI. THANK YOU. IS THERE A ROMANTIC CHARACTER TO YOUR FRIENDSHIP WITH THE DEFENDANT? NO, MR. MASARATI, THERE IS NOT. MASSARELLI. OH, SORRY. UNINTENTIONAL. YOU ARE ONE OF THESE GAY WOMEN-- DO YOU PREFER LESBIANS? TO YOU? ARE YOU GAY? DO I LOOK GAY? YOUR HONOR. PLEASE ANSWER THE QUESTION. ARE YOU GAY? YES, I AM. I'M SURE YOU HEAR THAT FROM WOMEN ALL THE TIME. BUT IN MY CASE, IT HAPPENS TO BE TRUE. SHE'S SCARED SHITLESS, JUST LIKE I WOULD BE AFTER TODAY. NO, I DON'T WANT YOU TO DO THAT, ANNA. I DON'T WANT YOU TO DO THAT. I'LL CALL YOU TONIGHT, ALL RIGHT? BYE. SCHMUCK. YOU DID YOUR BEST. WHICH IS MORE THAN I CAN SAY FOR YOU. JUSTICE IS HARD. JUSTICE? YOU CALL THIS JUSTICE? THIS GIRL PROTECTS HERSELF AGAINST SOME MARAUDING ASSHOLE WHO USES HER BODY AS A PUNCHING BAG, AND SHE'S GOING TO JAIL. IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT? I WANT HOLLY TO BE MY WIFE. I WANT US TO BE A FAMILY. WHERE, IN THE JOINT? I DON'T KNOW THAT. BUT I DO KNOW THERE'S NO KIND OF FAMILY WITHOUT THE LAW. NONE WHATSOEVER, 'CAUSE THE LAW THAT GOVERNS THE SOCIETY IS THE SAME LAW THAT HOLDS THE FAMILY TOGETHER. WHERE'D YOU READ THAT, ON THE SIDE OF A CHEERIOS BOX? YOU THINK I LOVE HER LESS NOW. BUT I DON'T. I LOVE HER MORE, AND THAT IS WHY I HAD TO DO THIS. COME ON. COME ON, COME ON. WAY TO GO, PAULA! WAY TO GO! AND THEY LIVED HAPPILY EVER AFTER. DID I WAKE YOU? NO. I--I WAS JUST LOOKING FOR A DRINK. THERE'S BEER. NO. I HAD SOME BOURBON FROM THE PLANE, BUT I SEEM TO HAVE FINISHED IT. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? I THOUGHT SOMEHOW IF I MADE THIS TRIP AGAIN, WE'D ALL BE HERE AT THE END LIKE THIS. OH, HONEY, NOBODY WAS HAPPY IN THESE PICTURES, EXCEPT MAYBE YOU. TOMMY WAS ALREADY SO FRAIL, AND YOUR FATHER... WELL, YOU LOVED HIM, DIDN'T YOU? YES, I DID, WITH ALL MY HEART. BUT I LOST HIM, AND TOMMY, TOO, AND THAT'S THAT. YOU JUST HAVE TO LET IT GO, ROBIN. JUST LET IT GO. I CAN'T. YOU HAVE TO, DARLING, BECAUSE IT'S NEVER GOING TO COME OUT ANY DIFFERENTLY, NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES YOU MAKE THIS TRIP. I KNOW THAT. WHEN WE LOST TOMMY... WELL, YOUR FATHER JUST COULDN'T LIVE WITH THAT. I DON'T BLAME HIM. IT'S NOT RIGHT, LOSING YOUR CHILDREN. CHILDREN ARE SUPPOSED TO LIVE AFTER YOU. OH, HONEY. ARE YOU CRYING? OH, MY GOSH. DO YOU KNOW I DON'T EVER REMEMBER YOU CRYING, EVEN WHEN YOU WERE A BABY. ISN'T THAT FUNNY? HA HA. I'M SORRY. I KNOW YOU'RE NOT WELL, DARLING. I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS, AND I DON'T WANT TO KNOW. BUT I KNOW YOU'LL GET BETTER. YOU WERE ALWAYS THE STRONG ONE. I CAN'T LOSE YOU. I CAN'T JUST LOSE EVERYBODY. I DO THE BEST I CAN. I KNOW IT'S NOT ENOUGH, AND I'M SORRY, BUT THAT'S WHAT YOU GET IN LIFE, YOU KNOW? YOU GET WHOEVER YOU END UP WITH, WHOEVER IS WILLING TO STICK BY YOU AND FIGHT FOR YOU WHEN EVERYONE ELSE IS GONE... AND IT AIN'T ALWAYS WHO YOU EXPECT, BUT YOU JUST HAVE TO MAKE DO. I'M NOT COMPLAINING, MOM. NEVER COMPLAIN, NEVER EXPLAIN. KATHARINE HEPBURN. SHE SAID THAT IN REDBOOKLAST MONTH. IT'S A GOOD MOTTO, ISN'T IT? THE BEST I CAN DO IS PRETEND YOU NEVER TESTIFIED, GO ON LIKE IT NEVER HAPPENED. GO ON TO WHAT? HONESTLY? I DON'T KNOW. ALL RIGHT. THIS IS THE SITUATION-- I AM STILL ANGRY, I DO NOT FORGIVE YOU FOR ANYTHING, AND I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT. ANNA FILLED ME IN. SHE TOLD ME EVERYTHING I NEEDED TO KNOW ABOUT THE TRIAL SO FAR, AND I KNOW I CAN HELP 'CAUSE I COULDN'T MAKE IT ANY WORSE. AND HOLLY IS AS MUCH MY RESPONSIBILITY AS ANYONE ELSE'S, AND SO ARE YOU. YOU ARE MY FAMILY, AND I LOVE YOU. NOW, I FEEL FINE. MY T-CELLS ARE OVER A HUNDRED, AND I'M RARING TO GO, SO... UNLESS YOU WANT TO WASTE TIME BEING STUBBORN, I SUGGEST WE GET ME ON THE STAND AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. YOU EXPECT US TO BELIEVE THAT THE DEFENDANT, PREGNANT WITH THIS MAN'S CHILD, WOULD LEAVE HIM AND NEVER LOOK BACK? IT WAS OVER. HE BEAT HER AND ABUSED HER. I SAW HOW HE TREATED HER. BUT NOT TO LEAVE AN ADDRESS SO HE COULD FORWARD HER MAIL. AND PRACTICAL REASONS ASIDE, LET'S SAY SHE DID STRIKE A BLOW FOR SELF-DEFENSE, AND SHE DECIDES TO LET HIM STEW IN HIS OWN JUICES. BUT A FEW DAYS LATER, SHE REALIZES, HE'S-- HE'S MY LITTLE BABY'S DADDY. AND HE'S NOT SO BAD. MAYBE HE'S GOT A TEMPER, BUT--SHE KNOWS SHE NEEDS HIM. SHE NEEDS TO CALL HIM. BUT--BUT IT WAS OVER BETWEEN THEM. I KNOW YOU THINK A GIRL LIKE HER, THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS A MAN, BUT SHE DIDN'T NEED HIM. SHE HAD US. WELL, I HARDLY THINK YOU'RE A REPLACEMENT FOR A FATHER. I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS, BUT... THERE'S SOMETHING THAT GOES ON BETWEEN WOMEN. YOU MEN KNOW THAT BECAUSE IT'S THE SAME FOR YOU. I'M NOT SAYING ONE SEX IS BETTER THAN THE OTHER. I'M JUST SAYING... LIKE SPEAKS TO LIKE. LOVE OR WHATEVER DOESN'T ALWAYS KEEP, SO YOU FIND OUT WHAT DOES, IF YOU'RE LUCKY. MM-HMM. WELL, THANK YOU FOR THAT VERY ILLUMINATING VIEW OF THE WAR BETWEEN THE SEXES. ARE YOU A LESBIAN, TOO, MS. NICKERSON? NO, SIR, BUT AT TIMES I UNDERSTAND THE INCLINATION. SUPPOSE THERE IS THIS BOND BETWEEN WOMEN. SUPPOSE MEN ARE DISPOSABLE. I DIDN'T SAY THAT. IF THAT'S THE CASE, WHY SHOULD WE BELIEVE YOU? WOULDN'T YOU SAY ANYTHING TO KEEP YOUR SISTER, YOUR BOSOM BUDDY, SO TO SPEAK, OUT OF JAIL? I AM UNDER OATH. I WOULDN'T PERJURE MYSELF. I'M GLAD I DON'T HAVE TO REMIND YOU. AND, JUST FOR THE RECORD... YOU DIDN'T KNOW-- YOU DIDN'T KNOW UNTIL THE POLICE TOLD YOU THAT THIS MAN WAS DEAD OF HIS WOUNDS? IF I'M LYING, MAY I BE STRUCK DOWN WITH SOME TERRIBLE DISEASE. O.K. ALL RIGHT. GOOD NEWS. I GOT AN OFFER-- INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER. EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES. ONE TO TWO YEARS. PAROLE AFTER SIX MONTHS. I GOT YOU MINIMUM SECURITY IN ARIZONA. TWO HOURS FROM HOME AND GOOD MEDICAL CARE. I'D HATE TO HAVE MY BABY IN JAIL. WHAT ARE THE CHANCES FOR AN ACQUITTAL? HE'S DEAD FROM HER ACTIONS, AND JURIES WANT TO MAKE SOMEONE PAY FOR THAT. SHE DIDN'T TESTIFY, AND I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH GOOD YOU DID HER. I MEAN, UH... MY BABY WILL HAVE A MOTHER WHO'S A CONVICTED FELON? I DON'T KNOW. WHAT DO YOU THINK? WELL-- UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES-- THEY'D HAVE TO-- I MEAN ABE. WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT, BABE? I THINK THAT YOU SHOULD TAKE IT, AND I WILL KEEP THE BABY TILL YOU GET OUT. YEAH, BUT-- THAT'S WHAT I'LL DO, THEN. FINE. I'LL TELL THEM WE TAKE IT. I LOVE YOU. I GOT TO GET IN THERE WITH YOU. DO YOU? I WANT YOU SO MUCH, BABE. COULD WE HAVE A MINUTE? YEAH.YEAH. WE'LL SEE YOU LATER. STAND OVER THERE A SECOND. COME IN HERE. THAT'S MY BABY. HONEY. OH, BABE, I MISSED YOU SO MUCH. ME, TOO. WELL, SO MUCH FOR THE BONDS BETWEEN WOMEN. I LOVE YOU. YOU CAN'T FIGHT THAT. I LOVE YOU SO MUCH. PRETTY GOOD IN THERE. WHATEVER HAPPENED TO HONESTY IS THE BEST POLICY? YOU DON'T WANT TO GO OVERBOARD. HA HA. HA HA. YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN THINKING AND THINKING AND THINKING ABOUT THIS, AND I WANT TO SAY IT-- I AM REALLY, REALLY SORRY. I TRULY AM. YEAH, ME, TOO. I GET SO ANGRY SO FAST. IT'S JUST-- IT'S LONELY. BETWEEN ME AND EVERYBODY ELSE, THERE'S ALL THIS... SPACE ALL THE TIME, AND IT GETS... BIGGER AND BIGGER, AND... I'M ON ONE SIDE, YOU KNOW? AND-- SCREAMING, AND THEY'RE... WAVING. AND THE ONE PERSON I THINK I'M HOLDING IS...WAVING, TOO. I'M HOLDING YOU. THERE WON'T BE ANY MORE LIES... BETWEEN US, N-NOT EVEN FOR MY OWN GOOD. NO, MA'AM. GOOD. I'M GOING TO GO CALL ANNA. SHE'S GOT-- JANE. YEAH? WHAT-- HEY, WHAT'S THE MATTER? WHAT'S THE MATTER? HEY, HEY! ABE! ABE! ELAINE. JANE. LISTEN, UH, I'M SORRY TO WAKE YOU, BUT WE'RE BACK IN TUCSON, AND...SHE'S IN THE HOSPITAL. WHAT CURSE, HONEY? WHO? THE ONE ON MY FRIEND. REMEMBER WHEN I CAME TO SEE YOU, YOU SAID THERE WAS A CURSE ON MY FRIEND? IT'S MY FRIEND ROBIN. SHE'S... LOOK, I DON'T BELIEVE IN THIS STUFF. I JUST THOUGHT IT COULDN'T HURT TO COME SEE YOU. OH, ROBIN. THAT'S THE GIRL WITH AIDS. ANNA'S FRIEND. SHE'S MY FRIEND. OH. OH, UH, I SEE. SO CAN YOU DO IT? DO WHAT? TAKE THE CURSE OFF OF HER. YOU SAID YOU COULD... IT'S AIDS, HONEY. I KNOW THAT, BUT RIGHT NOW IT'S JUST A LUNG INFECTION, AND I-- I DON'T WANT A MIRACLE. I JUST WANT TO GIVE HER A 51/49 SHOT. I MEAN, LOOK, I--I BROUGHT MONEY. I COULD PAY YOU NOW. PAY WHEN IT WORKS. I CAN'T PROMISE ANYTHING. DON'T WAKE HER UP. JUST DOING MY JOB. IS THAT A COLD? SHE CAN'T AFFORD AN INFECTION. I'LL HAVE TO MASK YOU.
