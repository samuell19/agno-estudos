GOOD EVENING, EVERYBODY, AND WELCOME TO THE 65th ANNUAL GRAMMY AWARDS. MY NAME IS TREVOR NOAH, AND FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THREE YEARS, WE ARE COMING TO YOU LIVE FROM LOS ANGELES. THE BEST CITY IN THE WORLD IF YOU IGNORE A FEW OTHER CITIES. TONIGHT, YOU ARE IN FOR A SPECIAL TREAT AS SOME OF THE MOST PHENOMENAL ARTISTS ON EARTH ARE GOING TO BE PERFORMING IN THIS BUILDING RIGHT BEHIND ME. AND THE RECORDING ACADEMY IS GOING TO BE GIVING AWAY THE BIGGEST SURPRISE IN ALL OF MUSIC, THE GRAMMY AWARD. SO, LET'S GET STRAIGHT INTO IT. TO KICK THINGS OFF ON MUSE'S BIGGEST NIGHT A GRAMMY-WINNING GLOBAL FORCE WHO IS THE MOST STREAMED AND LISTENED TO ARTIST IN THE WORLD WITH THREE NOMINATIONS THIS YEAR INCLUDING ALBUM OF THE YEAR "BIENVENIDO," BAD BUNNY! OH, HEY. GIVE IT UP FOR BAD BUNNY, EVERYBODY! WOW! WOW, THAT WAS INCREDIBLE. ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE. YOU KNOW, EVERY TIME I LISTEN TO HIM, I GET HIPS I NEVER KNEW I HAD. IT MAKES TRUMP WANT TO LEARN SPANISH. THAT'S WHAT IT DOES. THIS IS IT, PEOPLE! WELCOME TO THE GRAMMYS, EVERYBODY! WELCOME TO IT. WE MADE IT. WE'RE BACK! AND I'M LUCKY ENOUGH TO BE BACK AS YOUR HOST TONIGHT. MY JOB IS TO BE YOUR EYES, YOUR EARS. I'LL BE FLOATING AROUND THIS AM RADIO. THINK OF ME LIKE A CHINESE SPY BALLOON. THAT'S WHAT I'M DOING RIGHT NOW. GATHERING ALL THE INFORMATION YOU WANT. JUST LOOK AT ALL THE FACES. WE GOT THE BEST MUSICIANS, THE BEST PERFORMERS, BEST PRODUCERS IN THE WORLD. EVERY SONG ON TIKTOK THAT YOU HEAR, THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO MADE THEM. THIS IS THEM. AND WHEN I SAY WE HAVE THE BIGGEST NAMES, I MEAN THE BIGGEST NAMES IN THE ROOM. ARE YOU KIDDING ME? LL COOL J, MADURO IN THE ROOM. LOOK AT THIS ROOM. IT'S INSANE! IT'S THE WHO'S WHO'S EVERYBODY. WE GOT QUEST AND THE GANG. ARE YOU KIDDING ME RIGHT NOW? WE GOT BEYONCE'S IN THE ROOM, PEOPLE. YOU UNDERSTAND HOW AMAZING THIS IS RIGHT NOW? YOU UNDERSTAND, BEYONCE IS NOMINATED FOR HER ALBUM "RENAISSANCE," WHICH, BY THE WAY WAS BETTER THAN ANYTHING FROM THE ACTUAL RENAISSANCE, IN MY OPINION. THE RENAISSANCE WAS JUST PICTURES OF GRAPES AND STUFF. BEYONCE TOOK IT UP ANOTHER LEVEL. IN FACT, I WAS SO INSPIRED BY THE LYRICS OF "BREAK MY SOUL," THAT I ACTUALLY QUIT MY JOB. THAT'S HOW POWERFUL THAT WAS. I JUST WISH BEYONCE HAD ALSO WRITTEN TABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING SAVINGS BEFORE YOU QUIT YOUR JOB. HARRY STYLES IS TONIGHT, EVERYBODY! THAT'S RIGHT. WHAT CAN YOU SAY ABOUT THIS MAN THAT HASN'T BEEN SAID? INCREDIBLE ALBUM, MIND-BLOWING... WHAT IS IT 15-NIGHT RUN AT MSG AND THE FORUM? WOMEN THROW THEIR PANTIES AT THIS MAN AND THEN HE PUTS THEM ON AND HE LOOKS BETTER IN THEM THAN THEY DO. EASILY THE WORLD'S SEXIEST MAN. SEX SYMBOL OF THE GLOBE, ESPECIALLY NOW THAT THEY KILLED OFF THE GREEN M&M. THIS IS THE ROOM, PEOPLE. WE GOT L.A.'S VERY OWN KENDRICK LAMAR JOINING US IN THE BUILDING. THE MAN IS SUPER TALENTED. HE'S GOT GRAMMYS. HIS ALBUM WAS A THERAPY SESSION THAT EARNED HIM MULTIPLE GRAMMY NOMINATIONS. ALL MY GOT ME WAS HELPING ME OVERCOME MY CHILDHOOD TRAUMA. USELESS. FOR NOW WE'RE GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT TRAUMA. WE'RE GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT THERAPY. FROM COMPTON'S FINEST ALL THE WAY TO BROOKLYN'S FINEST. THAT'S RIGHT, JAY-Z'S GOING TO BE IN THE HOUSE WITH US. JAY-Z'S GOING TO BE PERFORMING. IT'S GOING TO BE SO SPECIAL. AND I'M OOH LOOKING FORWARD TO IT BECAUSE JAY-Z COULD'VE BEEN ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD TONIGHT. BUT HE'S HERE WITH US, AND I APPRECIATE THAT. LIZZO'S JOINING US. THAT'S LIZZO OVER THERE. OH, I SEE YOU, LIZZO. LOOK AT THAT SMILE. CONGRATULATIONS ON EVERYTHING, THE TV SHOWS, TAKING OVER THE WORLD, KILLING THE HATERS ON INSTAGRAM AND TWITTER. I LOVE IT. THE MOST FAMOUS FLUTE PLAYER IN THE WORLD SINCE I'M SURE THERE WERE OTHERS... BUT YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN. AND YOU WANT TO STICK AROUND BECAUSE LIZZO IS PERFORMING TONIGHT AT EXACTLY "BAD B... O'CLOCK." I'VE NEVER SEEN A ROOM THIS STACK. TAYLOR SWIFT IS GOING TO BE WITH US. OH, SHE'S RIGHT THERE! LOOK AT THIS. SHE'S RIGHT THERE. SOLD MORE ALBUMS THAN ANY OTHER HUMAN ON THE PLANET LAST YEAR. THAT'S RIGHT. MORE THAN ANYBODY. THE ONLY MUSIC WE LISTEN TO MORE THAN TAYLOR'S MUSIC WAS THE HOLD MUSIC FOR SOUTHWEST AIRLINES. THEY'VE GOT THE REAL STREAMING NUMBERS. AND I LOVE YOUR SONG "ANTIHERO." MY ANTI-IS ALSO A HERO. HER NAME IS BEATRICE. WE'VE GOT SO MANY INCREDIBLE GREATS PERFORMING TONIGHT. EVERYONE FROM STEVIE WONDER TO KASEY MUSGRAVES. WE'VE GOT FROM BONNIE RAITT TO LIL WAYNE. YOU DON'T WANT TO MISS ANY OF IT. EVERY GENERATION, EVERY GENRE. TONIGHT MY JOB IS JUST TO BE THE HOST, THE BEST HOST I CAN BE. AND TO DO THAT I TRY AND LEARN WHAT EVERYBODY'S INTO. I TRY AND KNOW MY GUESTS. FOR INSTANCE, I KNOW THAT LL COOL J REALLY LOVES BREAKFAST CEREALS. I KNOW THAT CARDI B IS OBSESSED WITH PRESIDENTS. THAT'S A REAL THING. I ALSO KNOW THAT ADELE LOVES TEA. HER VEGAS SHOW IS PHENOMENAL. AND THIS IS ONE OF THE STRANGEST THINGS I FOUND OUT. THE PERSON THAT ADELE HAS ALWAYS WANTED TO MEET BUT NEVER HAVE IS DWAYNE JOHNSON. YOU'VE NEVER MET HIM. YEAH. AND THEN I FOUND OUT THAT HE'S A HUGE FAN OF YOURS, TOO. AND I DON'T HAVE DWAYNE JOHNSON HERE TONIGHT, BUT I DO HAVE SOMEONE CALLED "THE ROCK." ADELE, MEET THE ROCK. THE ROCK, MEET ADELE. FIRST TIME EVER! ALL RIGHT. YOU TWO GET ACQUAINTED. WE'RE GOING TO KEEP THIS SHOW MOVING. NOW, BEFORE WE GET INTO OUR NEXT PERFORMANCE, I WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW THAT EARLIER TODAY AT THE PRE-SHOW, THE PREMIERE CEREMONY, BEYONCE WON TWO AWARDS WHICH PUTS HER JUST TWO WIN AS WAY FROM BREAKING THE ALL-TIME RECORD OF HAVING THE MOST GRAMMY WINS OF ANY INDIVIDUAL EVER. EVER, PEOPLE! TONIGHT WE COULD ALL WITNESS HISTORY. AND EVEN IF SHE DOESN'T BREAK THE RECORD, SHE STILL GETS TO BE BEYONCE, SO IT'S A WIN/WIN. FOR THE 65th ANNUAL GRAMMY AWARDS WE DECIDED TO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT. WE'RE GOING TO BE ASKING SOME OF THE PEOPLE WHO'VE PLAYED BIG PARTS IN OUR PERFORMER'S MUSICAL SUCCESS STORIES AND THEIR LIVES TO INTRODUCE THEM. THESE ARE THE PEOPLE THE ARTISTS WOULD THANK IF WE DIDN'T PLAY THEM ALL AFTER 25 SECONDS. HERE ARE THREE PEOPLE WHO ARGUABLY LOVE HER EVEN MORE THAN HER BIGGEST FANS. HER WIFE CATHERINE AND THEIR BEAUTIFUL CHILDREN ELIJAH AND EVANGELINE. MILLIONS OF YOU WATCHING TONIGHT FELL IN LOVE WITH OUR NEXT PERFORMER JUST FOUR YEARS AGO WHEN SHE TOOK THE GRAMMY STAGE FOR THE FIRST TIME AND DELIVERED ONE OF THE MOST ICONIC PERFORMANCES IN GRAMMY HISTORY. I WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO MARRY HER MORE THAN A DECADE AGO, SO I WAS WAY AHEAD OF YOU. IT MEANS THE WORLD TO ME TO STAND HERE TONIGHT WITH OUR TWO BEAUTIFUL DAUGHTERS BY MY SIDE, AND INTRODUCE, IN OUR HUMBLE OPINION, ONE OF THE GREATEST, MOST AUTHENTIC ARTISTS AND HUMAN BEINGS ON THE PLANET. HERE TO ROCK OUR FACES OFF WITH "BROKEN HORSES" FROM HER GRAMMY-NOMINATED ALBUM "IN THESE SILENT DAYS," MY WIFE, AND THEIR MAMA... Together: BRANDI CARLILE!

NOW, HERE TO PRESENT THE FIRST GRAMMY AWARD OF THE NIGHT IS JENNIFER LOPEZ. REMEMBER, SHE'S A SINGER, SHE'S A DANCER, SHE'S A MOVIE STAR, SHE'S AN ICON. AND EVEN WITH INFLATION, HER LOVE STILL DON'T COST A THING. PLEASE WELCOME JENNIFER LOPEZ. WOW, FROM BAD BUNNY TO BRANDI CARLILE, I LOVE MUSIC'S BIGGEST NIGHT. AND I AM SO EXCITED TO PRESENT OUR FIRST GRAMMY AWARD THIS EVENING. IN WHAT CAN SEEM LIKE A SINGLES WORLD, THIS CATEGORY CELEBRATES EXCELLENCE FOR A GREAT POP ALUM. A BODY OF MUSICAL WORK THAT TELLS A STORY THROUGH SONG AND CONNECTS WITH ALL OF US. AS THE LATE, GREAT PRINCE SAID ON THIS STAGE IN HIS LAST GRAMMY APPEARANCE EIGHT YEAR AGO, "ALBUMS STILL MATTER." HERE IS AN ECLECTIC GROUP OF OUTSTANDING ARTISTS WHO, EACH IN THEIR OWN WAY, RAISED THEIR EXPRESSIVE VOICES AND MADE A MUSICAL STATEMENT LOVED ALL AROUND THE WORLD. THESE ARE THE NOMINEES FOR BEST POP VOCAL ALBUM... "VOYAGE," ABBA. "30," ADELE. "MUSIC OF THE SPHERES," COLDPLAY. "SPECIAL," LIZZO. "HARRY'S HOUSE," HARRY STYLES. AND THE GRAMMY GOES TO... AND THE GRAMMY GOES TO... "HARRY'S HOUSE," HARRY STYLES! THANK YOU SO MUCH. THIS ALBUM, FROM START TO FINISH, HAS BEEN THE GREATET EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE. FOR MAKING IT WITH TWO OF MY BEST FRIENDS, TO PLAYING IT FOR PEOPLE HAS BEEN THE GREATEST JOY I COULD HAVE ASKED FOR. SO, I WANT TO THANK ROB, JEFFREY, TOMMY TOM TOM TYLER, AND EVERYONE WHO INSPIRED THIS ALBUM, EVERYONE, ALL MY FRIENDS WHO SUPPORTED ME THROUGH IT. THANK YOU SO MUCH. I WOULDN'T BE HERE WITHOUT YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH. COMING UP... PERFORMANCES BY STEVIE WONDER, LIZZO, AND HARRY STYLES. VIOLA DAVIS AND SHANIA TWAIN PRESENT GRAMMY AWARDS. AND LATER, AN ALL-STAR SALUTE TO WELCOME BACK TO THE 65th ANNUAL GRAMMY AWARDS, COMING TO YOU FROM THE BAHAMAS. NOW, WE'RE GOING TO BE TAKING A CLOSER LOOK AT ONE OF THE MOST COMPETITIVE CATEGORIES IN GRAMMY HISTORY. OUR NOMINEES FOR ALBUM OF THE YEAR. AND WHO BETTER TO HELP US WITH THAT THAN THE FANS THEMSELVES? YOU SEE, THIS WEEK THEY'VE BEEN DISCUSSING WHO DESERVES TO TAKE HOME MUSIC'S BIGGEST PRIZE. AND IT TURNS OUT IT'S A LOT EASIER TO HEAR WHAT THE FANS ARE SAYING WHEN THERE AREN'T 20,000 OF THEM SCREAMING IN A STADIUM. TAKE A LOOK. OKAY, IT'S TIME TO TALK ALBUM OF THE YEAR. BEYONCE'S "RENAISSANCE" GAVE US LOVE, JOY, DANCE. IT GAVE US ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF WHAT WE'VE BEEN THROUGH THESE PAST COUPLE YEARS. BUT IT ALSO GAVE US THE STRENGTH TO KEEP GOING. I'M ALICIA, AND YOU KNOW "RENAISSANCE" IS ALBUM OF THE YEAR. YOU PUT THIS SONG ON! YEAH! THESE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS OF MY LIFE HAVE NOT BEEN EASY. "RENAISSANCE" JUST GIVES ME THAT MOTIVATION TO KEEP GOING. I FELT LIKE BEYONCE WROTE THE SONG "CHURCH GIRL" SPECIFICALLY FOR ME. IT JUST SPEAKS TO THE DUALITY OF BEING MORE THAN ONE THING. YOU CAN BE SPIRITUAL, BUT YOU ALSO NEED TO TURN UP. SHE'S NOT TELLING US WHAT'S OUT THERE. SHE'S SETTING THE TRENDS AND TELLING US WHAT NEEDS TO BE OUT THERE. AND THAT IS JOY, THAT IS HAPPY AES. LIKE, YOU PUT THAT ALBUM ON FRONT TO BACK, NO SKIPS. YOU GET UP, YOU DANCE. COME ON... YOU WON'T BREAK MY SOUL THAT'S WHAT WE NEED. I TRULY DON'T EVEN THINK THERE IS EVEN AN ARGUMENT BECAUSE BAD BUNNY IS THE MOST STREAMED ALBUM OF THE YEAR ON THE GLOBE. HI, I'M NATALIA. THE ALBUM BY BAD BUNNY IS THE ALBUM OF THE YEAR. LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT "BENITO." I LOVE THAT HE'S PLAYFUL. I LOVE THAT HE'S GOOFY. HE HAS A MOTTO THAT IS... WHICH MEANS, I DO WHATEVER I WANT, I DON'T CARE WHAT PEOPLE THINK. HE DRESSES UP IN DRAG. HE KISSES HIS BACKUP DANCERS OF ANY GENDER. DISMANTLING MACHISMO. AS A QUEER LATINO WOMAN THIS IS SO IMPORTANT TO ME BECAUSE HE IS STARTING CONVERSATIONS AND NORMALIZING INCLUSIVITY. BAD BUNNY PLAYS BY HIS OWN RULES, AND HE'S JUST OPENING UP THE DIALOGUE. THIS ALBUM IS BREAKING SO MANY RECORDS. AND IT'S JUST SHOWING THE WORLD JUST THE POWER OF SPANISH-SPEAKING MUSIC. HE IS BEING HIMSELF, AND SO MANY PEOPLE ARE RESONATING WITH HIM. HE IS THE MOST STREAMED ARTIST ON THE GLOBE. THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HE DOES, HARRY! BUT BAD BUNNY DOES IT BETTER. I LOVE BAD BUNNY ALSO. BUT GUESS WHERE HE WAS LAST NIGHT? AT HARRY STYLES' CONCERT. MY NAME IS REINA, AND HARRY'S HOUSE BY HARRY STYLES IS THE ALBUM OF THE YEAR. SO MY 78-YEAR-OLD GRANDMOTHER HAPPENS TO BE HARRY STYLES' NUMBER ONE FAN. SO WE ARE FLYING TO LOS ANGELES TO SEE HIM IN CONCERT. LET ME TELL YOU WHY I LIKE HARRY STYLES. ASIDE FROM BEING GOOD-LOOKING, WE'RE NOT GOING TO TALK ABOUT THAT. I LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT HIM. I LIKE HIS OUTLOOK, HIS SONGS. AND WITH HARRY, HE HAS THAT THING THAT DRAWS PEOPLE TO HIM. IF THE GRAMMYS DID THEIR JOB, HE IS GETTING THAT AWARD. ALL RIGHT, THIS IS IT. EVERYBODY'S STILL COMING IN. COME ON THROUGH, Y'ALL. LET'S GET THE PEOPLE IN. WE'LL GET EVERYBODY TO THEIR SEATS. THIS IS LIVE. THIS IS WHAT'S HAPPENING. ARTISTS ARE COMING IN. TRAFFIC IS HOLDING PEOPLE BACK. I'M HERE WITH SOME OF THE FANS. GIVE IT UP FOR THE FANS, EVERYBODY. GIVE IT UP FOR ALL THE FANS JOINING US HERE, SUPPORTING THEIR ARTISTS FOR ALBUM OF THE YEAR. REINA, YOU MUST BE REALLY EXCITED BECAUSE HARRY JUST WON THE FIRST AWARD OF THE NIGHT. HOW ARE YOU FEELING? EXCITED. I'VE BEEN CRYING. I FEEL LIKE IF YOU HAD YOUR WAY, HE WOULD WIN ALL THE AWARDS. EXACTLY. EVERY SINGLE ONE? ON SO YOU WOULDN'T FULFILL HIM LOSING TWO OR THREE JUST FOR SOMEBODY ELSE? NO. WOW, I THOUGHT GRANNIES WERE NICE. LOOK, I KNOW THIS IS AN AMAZING PLACE TO BE. IT'S YOUR FIRST TIME THE GRAMMYS, YOU'RE HERE SUPPORTING YOUR ARTIST, EVERYBODY'S EXCITED. HARRY'S SITTING CLOSE, BUT I NEED YOU TO STAY RIGHT HERE. I DO NOT WANT TO HAVE TO TACKLE A DWGRANNY ON LIVE TV AGAIN. ALL RIGHT. IT'S TIME FOR US TO GET BACK TO THE AWARDS TO PRESENT THE GRAMMY FOR BEST R&B SONG. AN ICON WHO WON A GRAMMY EARLIER TODAY, WHICH MEANS SHE'S OFFICIALLY AN EGOT. VIOLA DAVIS. THANK YOU! I'M GRATEFUL. WHAT A NIGHT. "R&B IS NOT A FAD, IT'S THE TRUTH." THOSE WERE THE WORDS OF A SOULFUL QUEEN WHO KNEW WHAT SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT... THE GREAT ARETHA FRANKLIN. HERE ARE FIVE ALBUMS THAT PROVE THOSE WORDS ARE STILL TRUE. THESE ARE THE NOMINEES FOR BEST R&B SONG... "CUFF IT." "GOOD MORNING GORGEOUS." "HRS & HRS." "HURT ME SO GOOD." "PLEASE DON'T WALK AWAY." AND THE GRAMMY GOES TO... "CUFF IT." BEYONCE, THANKS, Y'ALL. ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT. SO, FOR REAL, BEYONCE IS ON HER WAY. BUT YOU KNOW THE UPSIDE OF HOSTING THE GRAMMYS IN L.A. IS THAT EVERYOE CAN BE HERE. THE DOWNSIDE OF HOSTING IN L.A. IS THE TRAFFIC. BEYONCE IS ON HER WAY. AND JUST FOR REFERENCE... HOW ARE YOU? CONGRATULATIONS. JUST FOR REFERENCE, BEYONCE HAS NOW EQUALLED THE RECORD FOR MOST GRAMMYS OF AN INDIVIDUAL OF ALL TIME. THIS IS IT. NOW THIS HAS BEEN AMAZING, CONGRATULATIONS. NILES, PLEASE SAY SOMETHING. THE LEGEND, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. UM, WHEN I GOT CALLED TO PLAY ON THIS SONG, IT WAS THE MOST ORGANIC THING THAT EVER HAPPENED TO ME. I HEARD THIS SONG, AND I JUST SAID, I WANT TO... ALL RIGHT, ROCK... I SAID I WANT TO PLAY ON THAT RIGHT NOW. AND IT WAS ONE TAKE. I PROMISE. I PLAYED IT, IT WAS ONE TAKE. I NEVER EVEN GOT... WELL, NILE, MAYBE YOU SHOULD DO THIS, MAYBE YOU SHOULD DO THAT. IT WAS JUST WHAT I FELT IN MY HEART. AND I'M SO HAPPY TO BE WORKING WITH YOU ALL. I MEAN... THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT. UP NEXT...

SPENDING HOURS WITH HIM WORKING IN STUDIOS ALL AROUND THE WORLD, I'VE NOT ONLY WITNESSED FIRSTHAND THE DEDICATION AND PASSION THAT GOT HIM HERE, BUT I'VE ALSO LEARNT THAT LIKE A FINE BOTTLE OF TEQUILA, MUSIC IS BEST SHARED WITH FRIENDS.

AND LATER, A SPECIAL ALL-STAR PERFORMANCE BY DJ KHALED AND JAY-Z. TO PRESENT THE GRAMMY FOR BEST RAP ALBUM, GRAMMY WINNER CARDI B! HI. THIS YEAR WE'RE CELEBRATING THE FIRST 50 YEARS OF HIP-HOP. HERE ARE SOME ARTISTS WHO ARE GOING TO HELP KEEP THE NEXT 50 JUST AS INTERESTING. THESE ARE THE EXCELLENT NOMINEES FOR BEST RAP ALBUM. "GOD DID," DJ KHALED. "I NEVER LIKED YOU," FUTURE. "COME HOME THE KIDS MISS YOU," JACK HARLOW. "MR. MORALE & THE BIG STEPPERS," KENDRICK LAMAR. "IT'S ALMOST DRY," PUSHA T. OH, SNAP! AND THE GRAMMY GOES TO... I'M SCARED. KENDRICK LAMAR! THEY GOT CUTE AS HECK WITH THESE TABLES. GOT THE WINE. I LIKE IT. NO, FIRST AND FOREMOST, I WANT TO THANK MY FAMILY FOR GIVING ME THE COURAGE, YOU KNOW, AND THE VULNERABILITY TO SHARE THESE STORIES AND SHARE MY TRUTH WITH THIS ALBUM. THAT'S FIRST AND FOREMOST. I WANT TO THANK... THAT'S RIGHT. I WANT TO THANK MY FANS FOR TRUSTING ME WITH THESE WORDS, YOU KNOW? YEAH. YOU KNOW, AS ARTISTS, WE ALL SAY THINGS TO PROVOKE THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS AND EMOTIONS. SO MAKING THIS RECORD... THIS IS ONE OF MY TOUGHEST RECORDS TO MAKE. AND IT ALLOWED ME TO DO THAT AND ALLOWED ME TO SHARE OTHER PEOPLE'S EXPERIENCES. GOING BACK AND THINKING BACK WHERE I STARTED WITH RAPPING, HOW FAR I CAME, I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE CULTURE FOR ALLOWING ME TO EVOLVE IN ORDER TO MAKE A SONG. LIKE "MOTHER I'M SOBER." THAT'S SPECIAL TO ME. THE BIGGEST UNDERGROUND ARTISTS OF ALL TIME, AND I FINALLY FOUND IMPERFECTION WITH THIS. SO I APPRECIATE Y'ALL, I LOVE Y'ALL. CONGRATULATIONS TO KENDRICK LAMAR. YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT, MUSIC IS MADE UP OF FOUR KEY ELEMENTS. RHYTHM, BEATS, MELODY, AND HARMONY. AND I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT THAT LAST ONE A LOT THIS PAST YEAR, HARMONY. DIFFERENT NOTES COMING TOGETHER IN A MOMENT TO MAKE SOMETHING MORE BEAUTIFUL. SO MUCH DIVIDES US RIGHT NOW, BUT MUSIC IS ABOUT UNITING US THROUGH OUR DIFFERENCES. IT'S BLACK KIDS AND WHITE KIDS REJECTING SEGREGATION IN THE 1950s, AND INSTEAD BLENDING R&B, COUNTRY, AND EVEN GOSPEL INTO ROCK AND ROLL. IN THE 1980s, A YOUNG BLACK RAPPER FROM QUEENS AND A JEWISH WHITE KID IN HIS NYU DORM CAME TOGETHER TO MAKE SOME OF THE GREATEST HIP-HOP OF ALL TIME. THEY MADE A POWERFUL NEW SOUND TOGETHER BECAUSE THEY WERE DIFFERENT. YOU SEE, MUSIC ISN'T JUST THE HARMONY OF SOUND, IT'S THE HARMONY OF HUMAN BEINGS, OF DIFFERENT RACES, GENDERS, RELIGIONS, IDENTITIES, SEXUAL ORIENTATIONS, KNOWING WE'RE DIFFERENT BUT REJECTING DIVISION TO FIND MOMENTS OF JOY AND UNITY AND HARMONY. AND THAT'S WHAT MUSIC IS ALL ABOUT. AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE CELEBRATING HERE TONIGHT. NOW, WE WOULD LIKE TO TAKE A MOMENT TO REMEMBER SOME OF THE GREAT PEOPLE IN MUSIC WE LOST THIS YEAR AND REFLECT ON ALL OF THE LIGHT THEY BROUGHT INTO OUR LIVES. WELL I WAS BORN A COAL MINER'S DAUGHTER IN A CABIN ON A HILL IN BUTCHER HOLLER WE WERE POOR BUT WE HAD LOVE THAT'S THE ONE THING THAT DADDY MADE SURE OF HE SHOVELED COAL TO MAKE A POOR MAN'S DOLLAR MY DADDY WORKED ALL NIGHT IN THE VAN LEAR COAL MINES ALL DAY LONG IN THE FIELD A HOIN' CORN MOMMA ROCKED THE BABIES AT NIGHT AND READ THE BIBLE BY THE COAL OIL LIGHT AND IT WOULD START ALL OVER COME BREAK OF MORNIN' YEAH I'M PROUD TO BE A COAL MINER'S DAUGHTER I REMEMBER WELL THE WELL WHERE I DREW WATER THE WORK WE DONE WAS HARD AT NIGHT WE'D SLEEP 'CAUSE WE WERE TIRED NEVER THOUGHT OF EVER LEAVING BUTCHER HOLLER WELL A LOT OF THINGS HAVE CHANGED SINCE WAY BACK THEN AND IT'S SO GOOD TO BE BACK HOME AGAIN THERE'S NOT MUCH LEFT BUT THE FLOORS NOTHING LIVES HERE ANYMORE EXCEPT THE MEMORIES OF A COAL MINER'S DAUGHTER EXCEPT THE MEMORIES OF A COAL MINER'S DAUGHTER TEARS ROLLIN' DOWN MY EYES UHM UHM CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MANY TIMES I CRIED CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MANY TIMES I CRIED DAYS AIN'T THE SAME WITHOUT YOU I DON'T KNOW IF I'M THE SAME WITHOUT YOU I AIN'T THE SAME REMEMBER THE DAYS WE SMOKED BIG BLUNTS TOGETHER REMEMBERED THEM DAYS WE ROCKED OUT COACHELLA THEM DAYS REMEMBER THEM DAYS WE AIN'T HAVE OUR...

SAM SMITH AND KIM PETRAS ARE ABOUT TO PERFORM "UNHOLY." WELCOME BACK TO THE 65th ANNUAL GRAMMY AWARDS. NOW, THIS IS TRULY EXCITING. LATER TONIGHT RIGHT OUTSIDE THE ARENA ON THE STREETS OF L.A., DJ KHALED WILL BE PERFORMING HIS GRAMMY-NOMINATED TRACK "GOD DID," FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER. AND, GET THIS, HE'LL BE JOINED BY RICK ROSS, FRIDAYY, LIL WAYNE, JOHN LEGEND, AND THE BIG HOMIE HIMSELF, JAY-Z. THEY WILL ALL BE OUT HERE TOGETHER LATER ON IN THE SHOW. AND I'VE SEEN THE REHEARSAL. TRUST ME, YOU DO NOT WANT TO MISS THIS. NOW, TONIGHT WE'RE NOT JUST CELEBRATING MUSIC'S BIGGEST STARS. WE'RE ALSO CELEBRATING MUSIC'S BIGGEST FANS. AND I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT THE STALKER ONES. ONE LEVEL BELOW THAT. SO IT'S TIME FOR THEM TO TAKE A LOOK AT SOME MORE OF THE NOMINEES FOR ALBUM OF THE YEAR. ALL RIGHT, Y'ALL, SO LIZZO DESERVES ALBUM OF THE YEAR BECAUSE OF HER ALBUM "SPECIAL." HAVE YOU TRIED HER DANCE? I DID. YOU WANNA SEE IT? BODY IMAGE IN GENERAL IS YOUR BODY'S IMAGE. YOU NEED TO LOVE AND ACCEPT IT. AND SO SHE JUST GAVE ME LIKE THE CONFIDENCE BOOST. LIKE WHEN I'M GETTING DRESSED OR READY TO GO OUT, SHE IS EXACTLY WHO I TURN ON. EVERY OTHER ARTIST TRIES TO FIGURE OUT THE ALGORITHM OF HOW TO GO VIRAL ON SOCIAL MEDIA. BUT LIZZO DOES IT TIME AND TIME AGAIN, AND SHE DOES IT EXACTLY ON THIS ALBUM. PERIOD, THAT'S WHY SHE DESERVES ALBUM OF THE YEAR. AL I'M SAYING IS ADELE DOESN'T NEED A DANCE TO GO VIRAL ON TIKTOK. MY NAME'S COLYN, AND "30" DEFINITELY DESERVES ALBUM OF THE YEAR. I SAW HER RESIDENCY OVER WINTER BREAK. IT WAS THE BEST SHOW I'VE EVER SEEN. SHE'LL GO UP THERE AND BELT TO THIS SUPER SONG SAD THAT'LL HAVE YOU TRY CRYING. AND AS SOON AS THE SONG'S OVER, YOU'RE STILL WIPING YOUR TEARS AND SHE'LL START CUSSING AND CRACKING JOKES AND HAVING YOU LAUGHED. SHE RANDOMLY DM'd ME AND SAID SHE LOVED THAT I WAS A FAN, SHE INVITED ME OUT TO L.A. FOR HER MUSIC VIDEO PREMIERE. WHEN I MET HER, IT JUST FELT LIKE WE HAD KNOWN EACH OTHER FOR YEARS. I WISH YOU GUYS LUCK. BUT ADELE HAS BEEN NOMINATED 18 TIMES AND WON 15 OF THOSE 18. SO THAT'S HER ALBUM OF THE YEAR RIGHT THERE. I RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE. BRANDI CARLILE'S ALBUM "IN THESE SILENT DAYS" IS IN THE GENERAL CATEGORY, IT'S IN ROCK, IT'S IN AMERICAN ROOTS, AND IT'S AMERICANA. IT EMULATES SO MANY DIFFERENT EMOTIONS. I'M ADRIANA, AND "IN THESE SILENT DAYS" BY BRANDI CARLILE IS HANDS DOWN ALBUM OF THE YEAR. WHEN I FIRST SAW BRANDI CARLILE, I AS JUST LEAVING MORMONISM AND REALLY TRYING TO DISCOVER WHO I WAS. I FELT LIKE SHE UNDERSTOOD WHAT I WAS GOING THROUGH IN THAT MOMENT. IT REALLY JUST ENVELOPED MY SOUL. I'VE SEEN HER 32 TIMES IN 15 YEARS. SHE'S TAKING HER SONGWRITING UP TO THAT ICONIC LEVEL AND ALWAYS REMAINS TRUE TO HERSELF. AND THAT EMPOWERS US TO REMAIN TRUE TO OURSELVES. WHAT SHE'S DONE FOR THE LGBTQ+ COMMUNITY HAS BEEN SO INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT TO ME. IT'S BROUGHT ME INTO MY AUTHENTIC SELF. THE JOURNEY OF SELF-EXPRESSION AND AND WHEN YOU FEEL ALONE, IT TAKES US ALL TO A PLACE THAT WE NEED, ALL OF US AT THIS TABLE. THIS NEXT PRESENTER IS ONE OF THE MOST BELOVED AND ENDURING STARS IN THE HISTORY OF POPULAR MUSIC. AND AFTER FOUR DECADES OF HIT SONGS, SHE'S ABOUT TO HEAD OFF ON HER 40th ANNIVERSARY "CELEBRATION" TOUR. EVERYBODY, PLEASE WELCOME THE LONGEST-REINING QUEEN ON EARTH, MADONNA! ARE YOU READY FOR A LITTLE CONTROVERSY? COME ON, PEOPLE, LET'S MAKE SOME NOISE! Y'ALL ARE GOING TO SLEEP OVER HERE. SO, HERE'S WHAT I'VE LEARNED AFTER FOUR DECADES IN MUSIC. IF THEY CALL YOU SHOCKING, SCANDALOUS, TROUBLESOME, PROBLEMATIC, PROVOCATIVE, OR DANGEROUS, YOU ARE DEFINITELY ONTO SOMETHING. THAT'S WHERE YOU MAKE NOISE. YEAH, THANK YOU. SO, I'M HERE TO GIVE THANKS TO ALL THE REBELS OUT THERE FORGING A NEW PATH AND TAKING THE HEAT FOR ALL OF IT. YOU GUYS NEED TO KNOW, ALL YOU TROUBLEMAKERS OUT THERE, YOU NEED TO KNOW THAT YOUR FEARLESSNESS DOES NOT GO UNNOTICED. YOU ARE SEEN, YOU ARE HEARD, AND, MOST OF ALL, YOU ARE APPRECIATED. SO NOW, SPEAKING OF CONTROVERSY, IT GIVES ME GREAT PLEASURE TO INTRODUCE TWO INCREDIBLY TALENTED ARTISTS WHO HAVE RISEN ABOVE THE NOISE, THE DOUBT, THE CRITICS INTO SOMETHING BEAUTIFULLY UNHOLY.

HERE TO INTRODUCE ONE OF THOSE MOMENTS, PLEASE MAKE SOME NOISE FOR A HIP-HOP LEGEND, A BELOVED ACTOR, AND A FIVE-TIME GRAMMY HOST, LL COOL J. IT'S GREAT, AND I MEAN TRULY GREAT TO BE BACK AT THE GRAMMY AWARDS TONIGHT. I'M HONORED TO BE HERE TO PRESENT A BRAND-NEW AWARD THAT THE RECORDING ACADEMY IS INTRODUCING THIS YEAR IN COORDINATION WITH THE BLACK COLLECTIVE. APP THIS AWARD WILL RECOGNIZE THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF CREATORS AND PROFESSIONALS WITH A PROVEN TRACK RECORD OF UPLIFTING BLACK MUSIC. THE RECIPIENT OF THIS INAUGURAL AWARD IS NONE OTHER THAN AN ICON WHO HELPED DEFINE WEST COAST HIP-HOP AND HAS BECOME ONE OF THE MOST IMPACTFUL SUCCESS STORIES OF OUR TIMES. AND NOT ONLY IS HE WINNING THE AWARD TONIGHT, BUT FROM THIS DAY FORWARD THIS NEW AWARD WILL BE NAMED AFTER MY FRIEND, MY BROTHER. AND I AM THRILLED TO ANNOUNCE THE DR. DRE GLOBAL IMPACT AWARD IS GOING TO, DR. DRE. HERE'S A LOOK AT THE GLOBAL IMPACT OF DR. DRE. DR. DRE IS ONE OF THE GREATEST GAME-CHANGERS IN MUSIC HISTORY. FROM HIS EARLY DAYS WITH N.W.A. TO "THE CHRONIC." FROM FOUNDING AFTERMATH ENTERTAINMENT AND COFOUNDING BEATS, TO ENDOWING ANDRE YOUNG ACADEMY FOR ARTS, TECHNOLOGY AND THE BUSINESS OF INNOVATION. I GUESS I'M AN OFFICIAL TROJAN NOW. DR. DRE'S IMPACT HAS BEEN GLOBAL, MASSIVE, AND AN AUTHENTIC AND POSITIVE FORCE IN OUR WORLD. ALL RISE. EVERYBODY STAND UP FOR THE FIRST-EVER WINNER OF THE DR. DRE GLOBAL IMPACT AWARD, DR. DRE! OH, WOW. I DID NOT EXPECT THAT. THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU. WHAT'S UP, BRO? YEAH, YEAH. I'M EXTREMELY MOVED BY THIS AWARD. I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO THE RECORDING ACADEMY AND THE BLACK MUSICIVE COLLECTIVE FOR THIS HONOR. I KNOW EVERYBODY IN HERE PROBABLY KNOWS THIS ALREADY, BUT THIS IS THE 50th ANNIVERSARY OF HIP-HOP. MAKE SOME NOISE FOR HIP-HOP. YEAH. AND WHERE WOULD I BE WITHOUT IT? WHERE WOULD A LOT OF PEOPLE IN HERE BE WITHOUT IT TO BE HONEST? HIP-HOP BECAME A LIFE LINE FOR ME AS A TEENAGER GROWING UP IN COMPTON. AND IT STARTED WITH A SONG CALLED "THE ADVENTURES OF GRANDMASTER FLASH ON THE WHEELS OF STEEL." SCRATCHING AND MIXING ON THE TURN TABLES HAD ME HOOKED AND BECAME THE ENTRY POINT OF A 40-YEAR CAREER OF DOING SOMETHING THAT I REALLY LOVE. WHAT UP, AP? YEAH. AND MUCH OF WHAT I LOVE IS INVOLVED WITH COLLABORATION, ASSEMBLING A TEAM OF TALENTED ARTISTS, ENGINEERS AND MUSICIANS WITH GIFTS DIFFERENT FROM MINE AND WHO SHINE IN WAYS THAT I DON'T HAS BEEN BOTH INSPIRING AND CRUCIAL TO MY SUCCESS. AND I'M EXTREMELY GRATEFUL TO ALL OF THOSE WHO HAVE COMPRISED THEIR TEAM OVER THE YEARS. AND I WOULD NOT BE HERE ACCEPTING THIS AWARD WITHOUT THEIR CONTRIBUTION. YES. I'M ALSO THANKFUL TO ALL THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN BY MY SIDE, OFTEN THROUGH THE DIFFICULT MOMENTS IN MY LIFE THAT CAUSED ME TO GET TO THIS POINT IN MY LIFE, YOU KNOW. INSPIRATION IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE WORDS, AND AS A CREATIVE, IT'S WHAT I'M ALWAYS IN SEARCH OF, AND I HOPE TO LEAVE BEHIND LONG AFTER I'M GONE. SO, WHAT I LOVE ABOUT THIS AWARD IS THAT IT USES MY NAME TO INSPIRE THE NEXT GENERATION OF PRODUCERS, ARTISTS, AND ENTREPRENEURS TO REACH FOR THEIR GREATNESS AND DEMAND THAT FROM EVERYBODY AROUND YOU. AND NEVER COMPROMISE YOUR VISION AT ALL. PURSUE QUALITY OVER QUANTITY. AND REMEMBER THAT EVERYTHING IS IMPORTANT. THAT IS ONE OF MY MOTTOS, EVERYTHING IS IMPORTANT. THANK YOU SO MUCH. APPRECIATE IT. CONGRATULATIONS, DR. DRE! IT IS SO FITTING THAT DR. DRE SHOULD WIN THIS AWARD IN A YEAR THAT IS SO IMPORTANT FOR THE CULTURE. SINCE 2023 MARKS THE 50th ANNIVERSARY OF HIP-HOP. NOW, PARAMOUNT GLOBAL WILL BE CELEBRATING THIS ANNIVERSARY ALL YEAR LONG. AND WE'RE KICKING IT OFF TONIGHT ON CBS RIGHT HERE THE GRAMMYS. ALL RIGHT. AND I'M PROUD TO BE A PART OF THE HIP-HOP FAMILY, WHETHER THEY'RE IN THE HOUSE TONIGHT OR NOT. AND WE'RE GOING TO ROCK THE BELLS FOR THE 50th ANNIVERSARY OF HIP-HOP. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? NOW, LOOK, WORKING CLOSELY WITH ONE OF THE MOST RESPECTED AND TALENTED GROUPS IN THE WORLD, THE ROOTS, QUESTLOVE HAS CURATED SOMETHING SPECTACULAR. A FLASH FORWARD THROUGH A HALF-CENTURY OF ONE OF THE GREATEST ONGOING MUSICAL STORIES EVER TOLD. IT'S A STORY THAT ALL BEGAN ON AUGUST 11, 1973, WHEN DJ WAS AT A PARTY IN THE BRONX AND PLAYED THE BREAK BEATS THAT KICKSTARTED A GLOBAL MUSICAL REVOLUTION. NOW, WE WISH WE COULD HAVE INCLUDED EVERY SINGLE HIP-HOP ARTIST FROM 1973 TO 2023. I KNOW, I KNOW, I KNOW. BUT THAT'S TO BE CONTINUED AT A LATER DATE AND TIME. ALL RIGHT? HERE TO GET OUR STORY STARTED, MY BROTHER BLACK THOUGHT! FIFTY YEARS AGO IN THE BRONX, NEW YORK, A STREET PRINCESS WAS BORN TO BE AN ICON. THE ARTFORM TOOK THE ENTIRE WORLD BY STORM.

A SONG CAN UNITE, INSPIRE, AND ULTIMATELY CHANGE THE WORLD. BEGINNING THIS YEAR, THE RECORDING ACADEMY IS PRESENTING A NEW AWARD RECOGNIZING A SONG THAT RESPONDS TO THE SOCIAL ISSUES OF OUR TIME, AND HAS THE POTENTIAL FOR POSITIVE GLOBAL IMPACT. MORE THAN 130,000 PEOPLE HAVE RESPONDED WITH SUBMISSIONS OF SONGS THAT PROMOTE AWARENESS, RAISE CONSCIOUSNESS, AND INSPIRE CHANGE. THE WINNER OF THIS SPECIAL AWARD WAS SELECTED BY A BLUE RIBBON COMMITTEE AND RATIFIED BY THE RECORDING ACADEMY BOARD OF TRUSTEES. TONIGHT, I AM HONORED TO ANNOUNCE THE FIRST WINNER OF THE RECORDING ACADEMY'S BEST SONG FOR SOCIAL CHANGE. SHERVIN HAJIPOUR, AN IRANIAN SINGER-SONGWRITER FOR HIS STIRRING SONG "BARAYE." THIS SONG BECAME THE ANTHEM OF THE MAHSA AMINI PROTESTS, A POWERFUL AND POETIC CALL FOR FREEDOM AND WOMEN'S RIGHTS. THIS VIDEO APPEARED ON SHERVEEN'S INSTAGRAM PAGE AND WAS SEEN MORE THAN 40 MILLION TIMES IN LESS THAN TWO DAYS. SHERVEEN WAS ARRESTED. BUT THIS SONG CONTINUES TO RESONATE AROUND THE WORLD WITH ITS POWERFUL THEME "WOMEN, LIFE, FREEDOM." CONGRATULATIONS, SHERVIN, AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR SONG. NOW, AS A TEACHER OF WRITING, I AM HONORED TO PRESENT THE GRAMMY AWARD FOR SONG OF THE YEAR, WHICH, FOR ALL OF GRAMMY HISTORY, WAS HONORED EXCELLENCE IN THE ART OF SONGWRITING. THESE ARE THE EXTRAORDINARY NOMINEES. "ABCDEFU." "ABOUT DAMN TIME." "ALL TOO WELL [10 MINUTE [VERSION]." "AS IT WAS." "BAD HABIT." "BREAK MY SOUL." "EASY ON ME." "GOD DID." "THE HEART PART 5." "JUST LIKE THAT." AND THE GRAMMY GOES TO... "JUST LIKE THAT." OH, MY GOD. I'M SO SURPRISED. I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY. THIS IS JUST AN UNREAL MOMENT. THANK YOU FOR HONORING ME TO ALL THE ACADEMY THAT SURROUNDS ME WITH SO MUCH SUPPORT AND APPRECIATES THE ART OF SONGWRITING, AS I DO. I WAS SO INSPIRED FOR THIS SONG BY THE INCREDIBLE STORY OF THE LOVE AND THE GRACE AND THE GENEROSITY OF SOMEONE THAT DONATES THEIR BELOVED ORGANS TO HELP ANOTHER PERSON LIVE. AND THIS STORY WAS SO SIMPLE AND SO BEAUTIFUL FOR THESE TIMES, AND PEOPLE HAVE BEEN RESPONDING TO THIS SONG, PARTLY BECAUSE OF HOW MUCH I LOVE, AND WE ALL LOVE JOHN PRINE, AND THAT WAS THE INSPIRATION FOR THE MUSIC FOR THIS SONG, AND TELLING A STORY FROM THE INSIDE. AND I JUST... I DON'T WRITE A LOT OF SONGS, BUT I'M SO PROUD THAT YOU APPRECIATE THIS ONE AND WHAT THIS MEANS FOR ME AND FOR THE REST OF THE SONGWRITERS WHO I WOULD NOT BE UP HERE TONIGHT IF IT WASN'T FOR THE ART OF THE GRAT SOUL-DIGGING, HARD-WORKING PEOPLE THAT PUT THESE SONGS AND IDEAS TO MUSIC. SO, I THANK MY TEAM FOR HELPING ME GET THIS RECORD OUT. AND THANK YOU SO MUCH. I'M JUST TOTALLY HUMBLED. I REALLY APPRECIATE IT. THANK YOU. COMING UP...

NOW THAT I'M UP HERE AND I'M CALM, I WANT TO DEDICATE THIS AWARD TO PRINCE. UM, WHEN WE LOST PRINCE, I DECIDED TO DEDICATE MY LIFE TO MAKING POSITIVE MUSIC. AND I WAS LIKE I DON'T CARE IF MY POSITIVITY BOTHER YOU, WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU? AND THIS WAS AT A TIME WHEN POSITIVE MUSIC AND FEEL-GOOD MUSIC WASN'T MAINSTREAM AT THAT POINT. I FELT VERY MISUNDERSTOOD. I FELT ON THE OUTSIDE LOOKING IN. BUT I STAYED TRUE TO MYSELF BECAUSE I WANTED TO MAKE THE WORLD A BETTER PLACE SO I HAD TO BE THAT CHANGE TO MAKE THE WORLD BETTER PLACE. AND NOW I LOOK AROUND, AND THERE'S ALL THESE SONGS THAT ARE ABOUT LOVING OUR BODIES AND FEELING COMFORTABLE IN OUR SKIN AND FEELING GOOD! AND I'M JUST SO PROUD TO BE A PART OF IT. BECAUSE IN A WORLD WHERE THERE'S A LOT OF DARKNESS AND A LOT OF... I'D LIKE TO BELIEVE THAT NOT ONLY CAN PEOPLE DO GOOD, BUT WE JUST ARE GOOD. WE ARE GOOD INHERENTLY. AND ANYBODY AT HOME WHO FEELS MISUNDERSTOOD OR ON THE OUTSIDE LOOKING IN, LIKE I DID, JUST STAY TRUE TO YOURSELF, BECAUSE I PROMISE YOU, YOU WILL FIND PEOPLE, YOU WILL ATTRACT PEOPLE IN YOUR LIFE WHO BELIEVE IN YOU AND SUPPORT YOU. I WANT TO THANK Y'ALL FOR BELIEVING IN ME AND SUPPORTING ME. BLAKE AND RICKY REED, PRODUCERS OF THIS RECORD, NICE LIFE ATLANTIC, FULL STOP, KEVIN ALANA, TEAM LIZZO, MY TEAM MY ROCK, MY FAMILY, MY MAMA, MY SISTER, MY BROTHER, MY DADDY! MY MAN. AND LASTLY BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE THERE ARE SO MANY G.O.A.T.'d ARTISTS. BEYONCE, WHOO! IN THE FIFTH GRADE I SKIPPED SCHOOL TO SEE YOU PERFORM. MY SISTER, SHE GOT ME OUT OF SCHOOL. IT WAS LITERATURE, I'M GOOD. AND WHERE YOU AT, BEYONCE IN MY EYES ARE WET. HAH! YOU CHANGED MY LIFE. YOU SANG THAT GOSPEL MEDLEY. AND THE WAY YOU MADE ME FEEL, I WAS LIKE I WANT TO MAKE PEOPLE FEEL THIS WAY WITH MY MUSIC. SO THANK YOU SO MUCH. YOU CLEARLY ARE THE ARTIST OF OUR LIVES! I LOVE YOU, GOD BLESS Y'ALL. YOU GO WHEREVER YOU WANNA GO, LIZZO. GRAMMY WINNER LIZZO, EVERYBODY! THEY SHOULD GIVE OUT THE GRAMMY FOR THE BEST SPEECH AS WELL. WOW, THAT WAS AMAZING. ALL RIGHT. NOW I HAVE THE GREAT PLEASURE OF ACKNOWLEDGING THIS YEAR'S RECIPIENT OF THE RECORDING ACADEMY AND GRAMMY MUSEUM'S MUSIC EDUCATOR AWARD... PAMELA DAWSON, DIRECTOR OF CORAL STUDIES FROM DE SOTO HIGH SCHOOL IN DE SOTO, TEXAS. THANK YOU SO MUCH, PAMELA, FOR BRINGING EVEN MORE HARMONY TO MUSIC EDUCATION. GIVE IT UP, Y'ALL. IT'S EQUALLY AN HONOR TO SAY THE RECORDING ACADEMY'S INDUSTRY ICON AWARD THIS YEAR GOES TO THE PHENOMENAL CHAIRMAN AND CEO OF ATLANTIC MUSIC GROUP, JULIE GREENWALD, AND THE CHAIRMAN AND CEO OF ATLANTIC RECORDS, CRAIG KALLMAN. AND JUST WHEN YOU THOUGHT I COULD NOT FEEL ANY MORE HONORED, I GET TO INTRODUCE THE BOSS WHO DOES MY PERFORMANCE REVIEW... THE CEO OF THE RECORDING ACADEMY, HARVEY MASON JR. JUST THINK FOR A MINUTE ABOUT THE POWER OF MUSIC. LET'S DREAM. THERE MUST BE LIGHT BURNING BRIGHTER SOMEWHERE GOT TO BE BIRDS FLYING HIGHER IN THE SKY IF I CAN DREAM MUSIC PEOPLE FROM ALL AROUND THE WORLD FROM ALL DIFFERENT GENRES CAME TOGETHER ON THE SAME STAGE TO CELEBRATE THE FIRST-EVER GLOBAL GRAMMYS SHOW. OH, WHY CAN'T MY DREAM COME TRUE OH, WHY CAN'T MY DREAM COME TRUE AFTER THE SONG GAINED WORLDWIDE ATTENTION, GOVERNMENTS ACROSS THE GLOBE CHANGED POLICIES TO SUPPORT WOMEN'S RIGHTS. THERE MUST BE PEACE UNDERSTANDING SOMETIMES THOSE AREN'T REAL HEADLINES, BUT THEY COULD BE. MUSIC IS POWERFUL. IT MOVES THE WORLD. IT HEALS AND IT UNITES. I'M HARVEY MASON JR., SONGWRITER, PRODUCER, AND CEO OF THE RECORDING ACADEMY. AND I'M PROUD TO WORK FOR AN ORGANIZATION WHOSE SOLE PURPOSE IS TO SERVE MUSIC, AND ALL THE PEOPLE WHO MAKE IT. WE'RE HERE TONIGHT TO CELEBRATE OUR YEAR IN MUSIC. BUT I ASK THAT YOU JOIN US THE OTHER 364 DAYS OF THE YEAR AS WE SUPPORT MUSIC PEOPLE THROUGH MUSICARES AS WE HELP EDUCATE THE NEXT GENERATION OF MUSICIANS THROUGH OUR GRAMMY MUSEUMS. AND AS WE ADVOCATE FOR THE ISSUES THAT MATTER MOST TO OUR MUSIC COMMUNITY. THIS IS WHY WE EXIST. IF WE CAN DREAM IT, WE CAN ACCOMPLISH IT TOGETHER, THROUGH MUSIC. THIS IS THE GRAMMYS, AND WE ARE THE ACADEMY. OH, WHY CAN'T MY DREAM COME TRUE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT, HARVEY. ALBUM OF THE YEAR IS STILL COMING UP. AND, REMEMBER, NOBODY KNOWS WHO'S GOING TO WIN THIS THING. BECAUSE UNLIKE THE U.S. GOVERNMENT, THE GRAMMYS KEEPS ITS CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS CLASSIFIED. BUT BEFORE THAT FOR THE LAST TIME LET'S HEAR AGAIN FROM OUR NOMINEES BIGGEST FANS. IN 20 YEARS SINCE A RAP ALBUM HAS WON, AND I THINK KENDRICK CAN TAKE IT HOME. MY NAME IS JENN. I'VE BEEN A DAY ONE KENDRICK FAN. I WAS AT HIS VERY FIRST CONCERT IN DALLAS IN A LITTLE BITTY CLUB. IN 2017 I HAD A GoFundMe SET UP TO EARN MONEY TO GET A NEW ACCESSIBLE VEHICLE. KENDRICK LAMAR FOUND OUT ABOUT IT AND DECIDED TO SURPRISE ME. AND HE BOUGHT ME A BRAND-NEW VAN. I CAN RELATE TO HIS REALNESS AND HIS SPIRITUALITY, KIND OF HIS OUTLOOK ON THE WORLD. AND HE'S VULNERABLE IN HIS MUSIC. HIS MUSICIANSHIP IS JUST AMAZING, AND IT'S CHANGED HIP-HOP. WITH EVERYTHING THAT WAS GOING ON, WE WANTED SOMEBODY THAT COULD COME AND LIFT OUR SPIRITS, MAKE US FEEL LIKE WE COULD KEEP GOING. SO I THINK THAT'S WHY IT SHOULD BE ALBUM OF THE YEAR. SO ABBA DESERVES TO WIN ALBUM OF THE YEAR THE MOST. BECAUSE AFTER 40 WHOLE YEARS OF NOT RELEASING MUSIC, THEY RELEASED THEIR ALBUM "VOYAGE." HI, MY NAME IS COLE, AND I AM 1,000 PERCENT OBSESSED WITH ABBA. THE CHRISTMAS OF 2018 MY HOUSE BURNT DOWN. IT REALLY BROUGHT ME INTO A DEEP DEPRESSION. AND I REALLY COULDN'T GET OUT OF THE DEPRESSION UNTIL AN OPPORTUNITY AROSE THAT SUMMER TO PERFORM "MAMA MIA" IN SANTA ROSA, CALIFORNIA, WHICH WAS THE BEST SUMMER OF MY LIFE. ABBA TRANSFORMED ME. ABBA EMBODIES HAPPINESS. THIS ALBUM HAS A MATURITY THAT ONLY PEOPLE WHO HAVE TRULY LIVED CAN CREATE. SO YOU FEEL LIKE THIS THE ONE? I HAVE GOOD VIBES. I HAVE GOOD VIBES COMING IN. WITH MUSIC OF THE SPHERES AND WHY I THINK IT DESERVES ALBUM OF THE YEAR, IT'S SO UPLIFTING AND SO POSITIVE THAT YOU WANT TO CRY. I'VE ALWAYS CONNECTED TO COLDPLAY BECAUSE, GROWING UP IN JUST SUCH A BIG FAMILY, I DIDN'T REALLY FEEL LIKE A LOT OF THINGS WERE MINE. COLDPLAY FELT LIKE THE FIRST THING THAT FELT LIKE MY OWN. I HAD JUST GONE THROUGH A BREAKUP, JUST FELT A LITTLE LOST AND DIRECTIONLESS. COLDPLAY WAS COMING TO TOWN. MY SISTER JORDAN, SHE WAS, LIKE, JOEY, YOU NEED THIS FOR YOUR SOUL, LET'S GO. SO I WENT TO THE COLDPLAY CONCERT TONIGHT. I WAS LISTENING TO THE LYRICS, AND CHRIS MARTIN BECAME MY THERAPIST. IT WAS JUST, LIKE, PROBABLY THE BEST CONCERT I'VE EVER BEEN TO. WHEN I LISTEN TO "MUSIC OF THE SPHERES," I KIND OF IMAGINE IT AS LIKE A COSMIC HUG FROM THE UNIVERSE SAYING, LIKE, IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY. ALSO, CHRIS MARTIN IS THIS SWEET BABY ANGEL AND HE HAS TO BE PROTECTED AT ALL TIMES. THAT'S IT FOR, YEAH. MARY J. BLIGE, QUEEN OF SOUL HIP-HOP AND R&B. SHE HAS BEEN IN THIS JOURNEY FOR 30 YEARS. AND TO NOW BE AT A PLACE WHERE WE HAVE ALL BEEN THROUGH SOMETHING, WE CAN ALL STILL WAKE UP AND FEEL LIKE THE WORLD NEEDS US, SO WE'VE GOT TO FIND OUR PEACE, LIKE SHE SAYS, ALBUM OF THE YEAR, BRING IT HERE. TELL MYSELF GOOD MORNING GORGEOUS WHEN I WAS IN THIRD GRADE IS WHEN I BECAME A FAN OF MARY J. BLIGE. I RELATED SO MUCH TO HER PASSION, TO HER SOUL. WE'VE BEEN THERE THROUGH IT ALL WITH HER, THE UPS, THE DOWNS, THE GOOD AND THE BAD. NO MATTER WHAT YOU'RE GOING THROUGH, YOU FEEL LIKE MARY GOT YOUR BACK. DON'T FORGET WE STILL HAVE DJ KHALED, AND OTHER PERFORMANCES TO COME. BUT FIRST STEVE LACY EARNED THREE NOMINATIONS FOR ONE OF THE BIGGEST HITS OF THE YEAR FOR HIS SONG "BAD HABIT." THE SONG WENT FROM NUMBER ONE AND HAS BECOME AN ANTHEM ALL OVER THE WORLD. JOINED BY THUNDERCAT. PLEASE WELCOME A GRAMMY WINNER ALREADY TODAY, L.A.'S VERY OWN STEVE LACY.
