How's it going? How are you? - Hi, Giba! - Hi! Did you hear that guy yesterday on TV about polution? I wasn't paying much attention ... The guy said that if the world keeps on getting polluted the way it's now, in the year 2000 everyone will be blind, deaf, and won't be able to get it hard. He said that? Won't get hard? He seemed to mean that. - Those people overblow it. - You're so right. - Who? - No. No one? Fuck this shit! - Hi, Giba. - Hi. - How are you, bro? - Great? Way to go. - Really great! - You're right. - Up for a drink? - I'm in. - You fag! Come on, leave it. This can get fucked up. Beto, are you sure it's not going to cause any probs? Nah. She is what these fools call a panther. Get it? Huge house, easy money. Drugs... Looks like there's some old man paying for everything. Get it? Out in the sun, drying, waiting for the prey. I have no job, I'm in whatever it is. There's a gardener and a maid. The guy is only at home on Wednesdays. And the woman... doesn't work today. - What if he comes home? - He won't, man. Looks like he lives in S?o Paulo. Only home for weekends. Probably married. You've checked him, right? Doing it right now. Everything's under control. At 17:00 she goes to the pool. Let's go. Easy there. Now. What do you want from me? Guess. Leave me alone. Don't, no one here's in a hurry, are we? Fuck, I told you this shit would go wrong, man. TRANSPARENT DEATH Take me somewhere East of Suez, where the best is the same as the worst and there are no 10 Commandments. Everything OK? - What do you think? - I'm asking. I need something to drink. I bet Marcelo had a great trip. Not interested? No fucking way! What's the prob? I think I've really fucked it up. - Again. - Listen to me, Ramiro... I got a big problem. Don't ask me what it is. Let's just say I'm in deep shit. Or can be, do you get it? You're my friend. For all that matters I spent... the entire afternoon here with you. Cool? - In bed? - Shit, don't joke about it. I mean it. Alright, alright. You spent the whole afternoon here. You're cool, man. - Where's my mother? - She went for some tea with Mrs. Kiki. And she said that afterwards she was going to watch a fashion show at the National. Beto! Beto! What? There's a man here looking for me. He says he's a cop. Hear that, Beto? I'm not deaf, I'm coming. Yes? Beto... don't you recognize my voice? I want to talk to my father. What do you want with him? I need to fucking speak with him. Where is he? Don't have a clue. He went traveling yesterday. May I help you? As a mother, of course. Ah fuck y-... You're still very immature, Beto. And you still like me. Want to know? You shouldn't have introduced me to your father. Alright... You're very smart. But there's a detail. These are yours, kid. You dropped them when you ran away. It was all dropped around in the pool. You aren't so smart. Let's do it again from the beginning. What was your plan? Rape, kill and then steal? Or simply kill time since you had nothing better to do? Whatever it is, kid, you're in a load of trouble. If you don't want to grow up outside, it'll have to be the jail making men out of you. What about the others? Who are they? Ah, I see... You don't want to say. How cute. I can't stop you from being a fool. You go to jail and the others stay out. You can't escape, kid. What a shit ganster. That girl made fools of you lot. Now give me their names. I don't have time to waste. - Doctor? - Do I. I'm withdrawing my accusation. Is that what you want, Madam? Yes. I am very sorry for the trouble I've caused you. Do you that this kind of sinister joke can very well happen again, Madam? These kids don't have the slightest respect for the lives of others! The complaint has been withdrawn, Doctor. Don't look so satisfied, boy. We'll meet each other again. You are the only one I could tell this. You and your crazy luck. Tennessee Williams wrote a story: the massager. - Read it? - No. This guy goes on breaking his friend's bones while he massages him. And his friend loves it. That's passion. Have you talked to the others? Yes. I told them we should lay low for a while. Good idea. And now? Now what? What do you think you're going to do? If I were you I'd go look for that woman. Don't give me that shit! There is only one reason why she'd have withdrawn the accusation. She digged you. I hadn't thought of that. Woman are like that, my boy. And there's nothing more unpredictable than a panther in heat. Hi. Well... here's the thing. I wanted to apologize and everything. So, sorry. Are we cool? I was a fucking idiot. And you were really cool by withdrawing it. You're welcome. - Even after that big scene? - Forget it, alright? What's done is done. I knew you were cool. That's why I came here to see you. Well, now I've seen you. I had to thank you for leaving that one guy hanging. He wanted to suck my blood, you know out it is. I can imagine. And by the way, I also wanted to tell you that you are different. No one else would have done what you did. It's all a jungle, isn't it? Looks like it. It seems like you guess the days when my maid's taken her day off. Do you want to know why I let you come in? I know why. Is that him? - Mm. - Married? Lives in S?o Paulo. You like him? Yes, I do. He's old. But he's good to me. Is that the only reason? He makes me feel safe. I learned to like him, you know? I think I even love him. Is this his house? He bought it for me. It must have been so expensive. It was, but he's very rich. What else? Money. He gives me everything I ask for. Jewels... ... a bank account. He signed a life insurence in my name. Is that all you want? Now I'm not so sure anymore. Hello? Ah, is it you? Everything's alright... Yes, everything. I was taking a nap. Alright. When? Monday? Perfect. I'll count the hours, darling. A kiss, yes? God, I thought you were never coming. - I have to be careful. - Why's that? You don't think about my situation. - You keep on calling me... - I only called three times. But in the craziest hours. I get this desire to talk to you just out of nowehre. And when the maid answers, you don't answer and you put the phone down. - What am I supposed to tell her? - Well, I don't know. This has never happened to me before. She is getting suspicious. You will have to be more careful or you will end up compromising me. - Send her away! - I can't. Jurema is her maid. - He brought her from S?o Paulo. - Find some excuse and fire her. Are you kidding? She is great. Man, I'm getting tired of this old man. And what of it? Is it you who's going to pay for my expenses? Cut it, you don't need him. You can sell off the house, get loads of money from that. - Money runs out as well. - What about the insurance? Don't be an idiot. The old man, as you call him, is as healthy as a bull. Learn to wait. There must be a way. Let's go to Barra. Hello? Damn, Marlene, that's great. I was getting nervous already. Done. At 6. I'm out of breath. I was going crazy these last three days. What was going on? You must understand, Beto. I'm not available. - I'm in a relationship. - But what... - We must be careful, alright? - This old man is always on the way. Calm down... Let's enjoy tonight, alright? Did you forget? Tomorrow is Monday. He arrives tomorrow. While he is here we can't see each other. My love... When you are far from me... think of me, alright? I also think of you. I need you. - What day is today? - Wednesday. Three days of fucking? - The old man must be good in bed. - Cut it, alright? You were thinking the same thing as I was? It even looks like I'm seeing it. You know what, Beto? You're in love. I am. How do you feel? Rotten. I know what that feels like. Now tell me something... Were you ever curious? - About what? - Spying on him. I shouldn't, but I've done it. - And? - She doesn't leave her alone for one minute! From the house to the pool. The bastard has this face just full of teeth. An immoral joy. You're really smitten. Or are you planning to marry into money? Both of those, you fag. You don't have a chance, kid. That... is what you think. Are you alone? Seven million people in this city. And we feel alone, isn't it? - I can keep you company. - Leave me alone. Damn it, I said leave me alone! Hi, Giba! Always a hit, aren't you? Stop it, Giba. You were gone, man. Now I'm in another department. I got that, who have you been screwing? Around, just walking around the city. It's all shit, isn't it? Sometimes you just feel like disappearing. Where? I'm with you and I'm not leaving, bro. I'll go see if I can catch something. - Don't you want to go swim for a bit, darling? - It's cold. Are you insane? - Shut up! - Oh, my god! - Shut the fuck up. - This is madness. Shut up and listen. I'm darting off, get that? You have to hold on, you're tough. Say that the old man dived and couldn't get out. - That's dangerous! - But it's done. Now hold on tight, everything's going to be alright. It had to be like this! Think of the good life we're going to live now. I'm running away now. Count to 20 and scream. Jurema! Doctor Montelo? This is Marlene. I know you liked him very much, Jurema. Yes... He was such a good man. We're all going to miss him. If it weren't for him I'd be back home already. In the heart of S?o Paulo, isn't it? Yes. My mother is very old, she needs me. We'll find a way. Death by drowning. He colapsed diving into the cold water. He never told you he had heart problems? No. - And Tony? - He must be on his way. You think Vict?ria will agree? I think so. She and Durval's wife were always very close. - Did you speak to Vit?ria? - She agreed. Now she insists that I too must be having an affair. This is only starting, I bet. But she couldn't leave her best friend in the middle of a scandal. Very wise of her. I thought it best to bring her with me. Let's go. Could have been worse. The main thing was to avoid any scandal. - Thank you, Ruy. - Now you can forget about that. - The rest is with us. - And... Jurema? Don't worry about her. She liked Durval very much. She decided to cooperate. She's going back to S?o Paulo. Good luck, Marlene. You're a brave kid. Can I call you? Sorry for interrupting. Were those your friends? Yes. As you can see, I'm well guarded now. I'm glad to know. I was passing by and I couldn't resist the temptation to drop by and say hello. Thank you. Very beautiful the tailflowers there. One of my weaknesses. I must retire within a year. I've a small place in Itaipava. I have a guarden full of plants. They're easier to raise than children. Can I get a cup? It's cold, I'll get the maid. No, don't bother. Did the boys show up again? No, never again. And I don't believe they will. Maybe. Indeed... you have a beautiful house. But I'm taking up your time. Sorry for the intrusion, Madam Marlene. And don't forget... if you need anything, just call. Thank you, delegate. Was it really Durval? - Mm. - Shit! I had to fire the maids. Are you sure no one saw you lugging that stuff around? The worst is over. Everything's alright, Vit?ria. Imagine if this ends up in the papers. It seems like you men have shit inside of your head. - Calm down. - I am calm, Tony! You don't need to yell. Know what? Get that crap out of my garden. When you start something you've got to finish it. You think I'm enjoying myself with all this? Calm down, everybody. No point in starting a scandal now. That is precisely what we are trying to avoid. If it were Tony that were in trouble Durval would do the same for him, wouldn't he? - Cut it! - You can't fool me, Tony! I did that more for Durval's wife who is your friend. Or did you do it for Durval's bitch? - What in the name of... - You two always split your bounty. Vit?ria, now's not the time to raise that problem. I am sick of your shit, Tony. Do you see? What did I tell you? She's nervous, don't mind her. I am also tired of all this. I'm full of it up to here. Full of these old men who can't live in the age they have. Full of these studs drooling over the ribbons of their high-class whores. Come on, don't be hysterical, last week at the Regime you were all over Durval. And then you came tell me he was hitting on you. - You pig! - Let's stop that, people. We are all very nervous. Please, Vit?ria, go make us a drink. The best we have to do is pay this bill straight away. Tony... we're going to have a very honest conversation afterwards. Wait a minute... What about the clothes? And Durval's luggate? - Oh, man... - You should just go back there, Montelo. Grab a taxi, get his stuff and bring it all back here in your car Alright. It had to end like this. Well, he wanted to fuck the entire world. It's not an accident that his wife was always so interested in you. She's not so bad. A little too possessive. And she's got a mouth that seems like it wants to swallow the world. And did Durval know? He must have, a cuckhold's revenge is a young and beautiful lover. Cuckhold, but a good man. All of us are cuckholds and good men. Let's go for those drinks. - I think it is disgraceful. - What? That Durval had to die in some, some whore's house. Couldn't he die in his own house? Like any decent person would? You shouldn't speak like that about a dead man, Vit?ria. Alright, alright. Death is a noble thing. To you, my old friend! May he rest in peace! It's better to throw him right now into the water. If you get too drunk you won't be able to get him up. She's right, Montelo. Let's get that over with. We should call the police straight away. Fuck this! Hey, friend! Can you get me a cigarette? You're having trouble, eh? You're shaking like a poor devil. Son of a... Well-known businessman from S?o Paulo dies accidentally in a pool of a friend's house. Marlene? Why didn't you call me before? Be patient, my love. You can't call me. I know, I know. But I'll call you, as soon as everything's all settled. I understand, but this is dangerous. There's his friends. Yeah. Jurema. She's still here. No, she hasn't gone traveling yet. I want you so much, my love. But this will only take a short while. I promise. Yes, I'll call you. You won't regret it. Alright. Come on, Marlene, I'm going crazy here. I'll tie myself to you, do you understand? Come on, I miss you so much. You didn't need to worry, Madam Marlene, - I could have taken the bus. - It is no problem, Jurema. You were very good to me, I'll miss you. Me as well. If my mother wasn't sick. - I'll leave you at the bus station. - I don't know how to thank you, Madam Marlene. Don't even think about it. And if you need anything, just call. Thank you. Beto! Yes, mother. Can I speak to you? Leave that for tomorrow, alright? You know it's been a week since I've last seen you? Ten days. You are a horrible son, Beto. And you... are an awesome mother. See you next week. - Hello! - I thought you were dead. Hello, man. Everything's alright? Since you never turned up, I thought something bad had happened. Ah, I imagined... Scared like a child? I know the joke is old, but remember: women give you cancer. Alright, show up. Robin Hood misses you. - Hello? - Marlene? - Hi... - I have good news. The money from the insurance has been made available. Of course there were some small problems, but I took care of everything. Today it's been sent to your account. 750 thousand. You won't have to worry about money for a while now. I don't know how to thank you. You have been a wonderful friend. It was a pleasure to do all this for you, Marlene. Ah... Is Jurema still at home? Yes, for a few days. I couldn't say no to her. Of course. But give me a call as soon as you are home alone. Beto. Nando. So this was my partner. We've been talking about you, kid. You did a good job. But you've got your pay. The partnership's over. I will give you a friend's advice. Don't show up here again, alright? You better get out of here, kid. You know, we should get rid of the house and get out of here. I'll be right back. Please, I'd like to talk with the delegate Costa. Yes. This is Marlene Bidal. How are you doing Madam Marlene? What's happening? Ah, he's back, is he? I knew this was going to happen. No need to worry. I'll take care of it. Did you think of what I said? I'm thinking. We sell this stuff. We go travel. I didn't want to sell it. This house makes me feel safe. With the money from the insurance, and what selling this will bring us, we will have a hell of a good time. Years travelling through Europe. Let's go in? I was thinking... it won't be easy to find dollars. Don't worry. I have someone here to take care of that. What about the tickets? Didn't you say your person would bring everything, tickets and passports all together? Alright, my love. You're mocking me with this ticket bullshit. You gave me the money to buy them and that's what I did. You keep on nagging me as if I had just spent it.. Do you think I'm here because of your money, because of this shitty house? Stop, leave that. I'll do what you want. I missed you very much, you know that? Having to see you hiding from everyone. You want to know something? I don't give a crap about your money. Understood? I just sort of like you. That's all. - Nando... - Yeah? Was Lilica better than me? She just had more money. And stop thinking that crap about me having another woman.. This is nice. And if you don't want to sell this tent, that's alright. - Shall we split the babe, bro? - Fuck off, leave us alone. Don't be a dork, kid. You'll see you'll love it. I'm gonna break your face. I will break you, you bastard. What happened here? 50 thousand dollars. - But, Ruy... - What is it? 50 thousand? Anything wrong? I gave him 750 thousand cruzeiros. If you buy them at 15, as you said... It should be less, should it? That's what friends are for. I don't know how to thank you. I like to do things for you. Today is Friday. Will you be at home Monday night? I'll find a way to. Wow, man, you're great. There is nothing money can't buy. When did I not find you something you asked for, hm? - It's loaded. - No worries. I can shoot. One of the few things my father ever taught me. You really think it's worth it? Every woman has the man that she deserves. I'll burn them both, you hear that? Both of them. Without breaking a sweat. You really think it's worth risking it? There's no danger. The house is in the middle of nowhere, there are no neighbours. And you spent all day in bed with me. You said you saw both of them at the swimming pool and ran away. Was that all? All of it. Killing isn't easy, Beto. That's what you think. Beto, the lone killer. Everything as we wanted it. 50 thousand dollars. 50 thousand? - How did you get so much? - That's what friends are for. - I'll explain it later. Did you call? - Ok. - Airport tomorrow at 6. - Oh, perfect. Ah, I almost forgot... I think it's best if we don't go together to the Gale?o. Best not to draw attention. - We'll meet over there, alright? - Sure. Cheers. I'm happy. A little bit happy. It was an incredible luck. Everything turned out alright. It had to. Are you happy? - I'm just worried about something. - What? The kid. He could pester us. Don't worry. The delegate has been warned. Tomorrow... we will be far away. Just the two of us. With no problems and no jealousy. Just the two of us. It was good we didn't need to sell this house. When we come back we'll get to enjoy it all and no one bothering us. Hello? Ah, how is the Madam doing? Yes, he spent the night over here with me. Don't worry. Of course. I won't let him do anything wrong. Detective ?ngelo speaking. Tell delegate Costa that the kid is driving out of Niemeyer. What's the problem? She called for me. Oh, did she? It's not what you're thinking, I always come here. She asked me to clean the pool for her. - So now you're a friend of the house? - That's right. Madam Marlene, how are you doing? I just asked you a question. He went to town. Today is a tide is tame, as you people say. I'll wait for her. I think she's going to be late. I'm sure she's going to take a long time to get here. I'm not in a hurry. It's still early. I got the afternoon free. Pan Am, flight 515. Board gate 18. - The flight is on schedule, sir. - Great, thanks. - Oh, Mr. Fernando? - What is it? A lady left a note, she's waiting at the bar. Once again, thank you very much. The big boy's in jail. How did that happen? The most important thing was knowing... why they do these things. Why? After all... whose fault is it?
