[General's Son II] Our Doyama boss told us to help you. They are our men. Thank you for coming all the way. Gin-Do Gang, let's be friends from now on. I'll be hard for me to get promoted if you guys get into trouble again. Gang, I'll see you. Hello, sir? Who's this? - It's Doo-Han - It's Doo-Han Kim! Welcome back! - Doo-Han's here! - Doo-Han, is this for real? It is him! Welcome back to town! Hello? Oh, Doo-Han came! - How do you do? - You must have gone through hell. I fell asleep at dawn for a moment. The store door opened and someone send "one red bean soup here, please." So, I knew you'd come out today. - Brother - Brother I thought you'd arrive here at night. Where's everyone? They went to collect some money. We thought we needed some money for your big release. Brother Hammer found a place for you to stay. Welcome, Doo-Han. Thank you for everything. - It's my pleasure... - Please get inside. Ok-Soon, bring some drinks here. Brother, it must have been really hard for you. We went to the Mapo Police Station, but they said, you moved to another station. Brother Pig's eye couldn't come because he's not well today. We'll depart when the sun rises tomorrow. The Jong-Lo gang members will have a welcome-back party at the Myung house tonight. Tonight's the chance. - No, It's tomorrow morning. - Yes, boss. When paying off your debt you play fair. - Dong-Hae. - Yes, boss. You'll be out this time. You lost intentionally last time. That's not true, boss. Do not speak! You can just watch how we bring them down. After you got arrested Those Japanese bastards invaded our restaurants, inns, stores started to suffocate our district. Now, they expanded to here, Jong-Lo street. Furthermore, I lost my bar to a Jap and the owner of NakWon house, too. But, we still have Jong-Lo night market. Hey Chap, that's because we pay taxes to Hayashi. What did you say? What do we do, then? It's all because of you guys so that you don't get hurt. Be quiet! That just crushed my pride. You be quiet, Hammer. Come on, let's just celebrate this wonderful day! I agree, you are making him worry on his first day out of prison. Everyone, Cheers to Doo-Han. - Come on. - Cheers... You've suffered... Have a shot. Have my shot, too. - Here you go. - Yes. - Oh - Have mine, too. Where's everyone else? Would you like to see for yourself? Find him! Doo-Han Kim! - Get out! - Get out of the way! Sit! Now, his Jong-Lo gang is finished. Look and learn. Are you alright? - Yes, I'm sorry, boss. - Do not worry. Yes, Yes... I see. - Mr. Kin! - Yes? Who's visiting at this hour? Boss Hayashi and Jong-Lo gang heroes will drink together. Hello. Welcome. Welcome, sir. - Are you prepared? We couldn't find the finest drink because we didn't have enough time though. - Let's have a seat - This way, sir. It's an honor to have you here in cafe Sakura, Mr. Do-Kang Kin. He's not Do-Kang Kin. He's the new boss of Jong-Lo gang, Mr. Kin. Oh well, I am sorry. He's Do-Kang Kin. Did I make a mistake, Mr. Do-Kang Kin? Boss, Hayashi! I, Ki-Hwan Kim, as a boss of the Jong-Lo gang appreciated your kind gesture. However, I need to say a few words. You disturbed Jong-Lo street while I was gone and trampled my men unfairly. I am here to ask why. So, do explain! I admire your bravery. You win. We'll give Jong-Lo street back to Mr. Kin and leave. Jong-Lo gang and Hon-Ma gang will reconcile from now on and agree not to invade each other's district. Agreed? Agreed. Is everything alright? Is everything alright with you? - It seems to be settled well. - I agree. Have a good night. Thank you. Are you asleep? - Are you asleep? - Who is it? - It's Ok-Soon. You have a phone call. - A phone call? - From whom? - A woman. Hello? - It's Sezco from Cafee Sakura. - Excuse me? You left something here. Well, here. - Hello? - I don't understand. - Hello? Hello, he doesn't understand Japanese. I'll translate for you. He left something here. I'd like to give it back to him. - Did you leave anything there? - I don't think so. He doesn't think he left anything there. He probably doesn't recall because he was very drunk. Please ask him if he left his hat here. - A hat? Hey. - It's a hat... Yes, it's a hat. He said he lost it. I'd like to give it back to him. Could you ask him when he can drop by? - Hey, when can you drop by? - I have no business going back there. Hello, he doesn't seem like he wants it back. I see. Good night. Hello. Hello. Well, how did it go? This is it? - You losers! This is all you can do? Tell us rather to rob. What? Korean merchants are now against us because we collect money from them almost everyday. You suckers. It's myself alone who has rebuilt this place like this. Don't ever talk back to me. Did you do it yourself with your own fist? You survive by paying tax to Hayashi. Watch your mouth! That's why I meet with him everyday. The tax issue will be resolved soon. Shit! When do we have to live like this? What do we do? Brother Do-Han stays neutral. Sezco, what are you doing, here? Hello? Excuse me. It's your hat. - Thank you. - I am free this afternoon so, I came to town watch a movie and all. - Hey, Washington - Yes. You translate for me. What did you just say? I said I came to watch a movie and all. She came to watch a movie. - A movie? - Yes. Tell her I'll show her a movie. - Hello, - Yes. What the hell is going on? - Help me! - Come here! - Help! - Don't move! Help! - Get out! - Who is he? Kill him! Thank you. Is this boring to you? No fun? I've watched it 8 times. 8 times! - Was the boxing match fun? - Yes. Bok-Su Jung is a Korean boxer. He's the best! Yes. for the boxer, Ni-Hong? Bok-Su Jung is Japanese... Doo-Han Kim is Japanese, too. We're all citizens of Japan, aren't we? My father is Japanese and my mother's Korean. Your mother's Korean? Jong. I won. Mr. Kin, I think you'll lose all night as usual. Shut up! You traitor! You even changed your family name. What! I got you out of prison, and even gave Jong-Lo gang back to you. What, you gave it to me? You, son of a bitch! Stop! Don't fight when we play mah-jongg. You heard that I was Hayashi's puppet? Yes. You, son of a bitch! Why didn't you tell me before? Hey, wake up! Hey,you! You guys, come over here. Come here you bastards! Come over here, you assholes! What's the matter? You dodged? - You, asshole. - What's your problem? Are you drunk? Come on. Come here, you bastard! You, come back here! Go tell Doo-Han. I got used by Hayashi because I was a fool. I'll be gone. Respect Doo-Han. Brother, what the hell is going on? It's not the time that you play with a Jap bitch. What the hell are you... Brother Ki-Hwan just left Jong-Lo. What? Brother, Ki-Hwan? Brother! Let's start over and rebuild this place from the bottom up. I've never seen them before. Hey, you! Where are you guys from? - Why are you here? - I came here to see Chun-Sik Jung. What! You, asshole! Where's Chun-Sik Jung? I have no idea. I really don't have a clue. Go and tell him that Doo-Han Kim wants to see him. - Are you brother Kim? - It's him. I'll have some drinks here. - Are you deaf? - Give me some here, too. I was known as the Furious Lee from Mapo when I was young. I am the Akaonin of Mapo. Who beat the shit out of my men? - Who did that? - It's me. You bastard! Son of a bitch! Everyone, Calm down! Please don't fight! You're destroying my place. You suckers. You call this a fighting? I am the Furious Lee, you assholes! You, punk! Asshole! Here comes Chun-Sik Jung! Get out! Get out! Brother Kim, I am Chun-Sik Jung. I was a very close to Ki-Hwan. So, it'll be fine to treat you as my younger brother? What the hell are you talking about? He's the boss of number one district of the city, Jong-Lo. You cannot treat our boss like that when you are just a boss of Mapo. You small town loser! This is my district. You are not in my league yet. I don't wanna crush a youngster like you with prospect. I have to do this, anyway. You are not paying tax to us. You're telling me to pay tax to you? What a crazy punk! No one, even Ma-Juk Gu or Ki-Hwan Kim told me to pay tax to them. I, Chun-Sik Jung just helped them with my own will. Do you need money? I can help you if you're having a hard time. I'd have to get it from you. Here, brother. Brother, here. Come back, you bastards! Come here! Here comes Doo-Han Kim. He's here to collect tax. You can't invade here you little piece of shit! I thank you brothers for coming all the way to here. Let's celebrate! Thank you. - She's the new manageress here. - I'm Hwa-Sun. Introduce yourselves. - I'm Yu-Jin - I'm Eun-Jung. - I am Ju-Hee. - I am Eun-Mi. - Doo-Han! - What are you girls doing here? Well, the owner of this place has been changed. - You're still a baby. - Well, I'm trying to grow up. Didn't you become the mistress of the linen dealer. What are you doing here, then? Well, I got out. I got fed up. I'm Hyun-Ju. Today is the day that boss Doo-Han is rebuilding the Jong-Lo gang. Our Jong-Lo Gang has faced a new era by passing Ma-Juk Gu and Gi-Hwan Kim's period. Let's toast for the justice and the spirit of Korean youngsters! - Cheers! - Cheers! Brother Chun-Sik, I heard that you can sing very well. Why don't you sing for us? O.K. It's a song called, empty heart. Go ahead. My life, my way that's been flowing along with wind and clouds. Though twisted and hurt I've lived my life to the fullest. I live for the justice with a firm fist. A cold street that I turned to with empty hands. A lonely street lamp, do you know? This empty heart of mine. Ki-Hwan Kim went to China without a word. Jung-Su Yang walked out on us. Nam-San Kim, Chun-Sam Lee and even Chun-Sik Jung went under Do-Kang Kin. Shit! I shoud've killed him that day. I'll kill him. - Are you confident? - Yes. He was very drunk that day. Don't worry. I can beat him. Good. You finish him at the center of Jong-Lo square. Yes, boss. I won. I'm going. - Pay - How much? Fifteen cents. You, stop! Come back here! Hey, pal. There's money everywhere. If you get this right, I'll give you ten times the amount, ten times! I had a bad dream last night. I'm having a bad luck. It's ten times the amount! Look, this red one. If you figure out which one's the red one I'll give you ten times the amount. Don't say you saw it and missed it. You gotta go to a mountain to catch a tiger, and go to the water to catch a fish. Well, which one is it? It's hard to guess and pick. - What I'm saying is, Here's the red one. - Hey! Here. Oh no, It's the white one. What just happened? What happened was you missed it. Hey, who am I? I am the proud son of the AnDong Kim Family. Dong-Hae Kim, I wanted to meet you in person. You came on your own. Ever since that disgraceful day, I haven't been able to sleep. You probably think that it was a fair fight that you won. It's your delusion. 20 years ago, I let you win because of one bowl of red bean soup when I was extremely poor and starving. What? When you and I were homeless... You little punk! Do you think I do this for charity, you asshole! - Hey, let's go! - Hey, you! You! I didn't eat four days. Thank you. Hey, there's our gang under the Su-Pyo bridge. Do you wanna go and live with us? I have to go find my uncle who's in North of Unsnap. My name's Dong-Hae Kim What's yours? Dong-Hae Kim... That was you. I swore to my boss, Hayashi that I'll beat you at the Jong-Lo square. Accepted. Let's go outside. Wait, It looks like fun. - Brother Yong-Pal! - Yeah? Doo-Han brother's bringing a guest here. Don't get anyone else. I know. It's Dong-Hae, right? You are still very fast. - Hey, honey! - Hello. You bitches come here and say hello to him. - Yes. - Yes, sir. He's the famous fighter, Dong-Hae Kim. I'll introduce them to you. This is a bitch who keeps seducing me nonstop. And, those two bitches... They're sisters. Their family must be in need fast cash letting them out for work together. And that one came here after her husband's death. Those three came from another house. That little one's lover passed away. That bitch's a mistress of the Linen... Oh? O.K. Let's just pass those bitches. That one... Huh? Who are you? When did you start working? She's new here. Chae-Hwan Song. Dong-Hae and I met when we were homeless back then. Dong-Hae was caught stealing bread and was being beaten by the owner. I saved him myself. I brought him to the red bean soup place and let him eat well. I let him run first and then, I ran for my life, too. The owner got so pissed off. Don't try to blame yourself for losing. Sometimes you can have a bad day. Victory and defeat are but ordinary events in a soldier's career. You, Cha-Hwan! Come here and pour the drink. Come! Get out! You bitch... I couldn't win. I heard. You lost but It was a great match. It became the talk of the town. Heard you drank... Yes, boss... Became friends? - Yoko... - Yes, sir. Let him rest. Yes. Have a good night. Are you troubled? Are you thinking about what happened today? Where are you guys going? We are going to the soccer game. Is everyone going? Pig's eye and Sweet potato will stay here. Don't you wanna go, boss? - I'm not going. - Hey! - Why are you here? - I came here to see brother Doo-Han. What the hell! We came here to see brother Doo-Han. - Where do you think you're at? - Let them in. We'd like to work for you. Please let us work for you. You came from Mapo? Kill that bastard! You asshole! Go home and do that to your wife! Kill that bastard, kill! We should be dancing... - Hello, Sweetie? - Hi. - Hey, menagerie! - Sit here. - Hello? - Hey. I wanna see Chae-Hwan. Why is it so loud? They're the Pyung-Yang soccer team. They won today. I think I was too harsh on you the other night. I was pretty drunk that day. Sorry for misbehaving. Hey, Be quiet there! Who just said that? You, who the hell are you? You bastard! Son of a bitch! Do-Kang Kin You've just crushed the Pyung-Yang soccer team. Do you think this is the Mapo riverside, don't you? What an imposter! Tell the truth! Nothing happened. She has nothing to do with it. Let her go now! What's your occupation? - I said what do you do? - I work for the Myung-Sung Bar. Myung-Sung Bar? Oh, well... a geisha? Oh, no. A professional entertainer. How are you related to him? Is it secretive? Kumimoto, she's got nothing to do with this! - Let her go, now! - Shut your hole! She a witness. You son of a bitch! This is the last warning. You should let her go. - A warning? What if I can't? - I'll cut your throat someday! You have no chance. You can't look down on me because you won every other fighter in Korea. You're done. You'll stay in prison even longer this time. When you get out Your dignity and legend will be nothing but an ancient story. Attention! What happened? - He's been a trouble, again. Stop! Judo is in the spirit. Those who are willing to sacrifice their lives for the spirit should only perform martial arts. We can find these cases in real fights as well. We are one, we sacrifice our blood for the nation. We sacrifice our blood for the nation. We sacrifice our sweat for the family. One, we sacrifice our sweat for the family. One, we sacrifice our fists for love. Good! I'll prove to you that an actual case like this dose exist. Do-Kang Kim, come here. He is an unconvicted prisoner who's arrested in Jong-Lo Police Station. As you all know, he is the finest fighter in the world of Korean gang. A month ago, this man here had a fight with 23 men alone. Do-Kang Kin, in fighting those 23 soccer players, did you pride yourself in fighting fair without using any weapon according to the spirit of martial arts? Do-Kang Kin, when fighting those 23 soccer players did you pride yourself in fighting fair without using any weapon according to the spirit of martial arts? Yes, sir. You won a fight with 23 soccer players? Did you win a fight with 23 soccer players? I really wanted to win that fight. I really wanted to win that fight... - For a woman? - For a woman? For there was your lover next to you? Yes, Captain Maruoka. I want you to judge this case in the capacity of Jong-Lo department officers. Is this man's fight for the spirit of Martial Arts guilty, or innocent? - Innocent! - Innocent! Do-Kang Kin, you must have a good background. Don't trust that too much. You'll be gone before you even know it. Remember. From now on, we decided to - call Captain Maruoka a brother. - call Captain Maruoka a brother. For Brother Maruoka! - Toast - Toast! Brother, let's sing together on this great day. - Sing! Let's sing! Sing! - Alright! What the... You brainless trash! Aren't you Doo-Han Kim? - Who are you? - You jerk! Is he on crack? What's his problem? You're a bastard who ruins his father's reputation and grace. Admiral Jua-Jin Kim didn't have a son like you. His father fights Japs only with spirit. But his son sings along to a Jan's military march? He sings a military song that killed his father. What a piece of trash. Well, he is actually an uncle of our boss. He dose that every time he drinks. Please understand, sir. Alright. I don't think this is my place to be. Who the hell are you? He's a novelist, Gye-Ju Park. Boss, they are here. - Let them in - Yes, sir. Come in. I said come in. Sit there. Make yourselves comfortable. O.K. Start reading. You read a man's part and you a woman's. Read it like you're storytellers, alright? [Pure Love] You're earning your school tuition. In a beach where pretty shells are being teased by blue waves, behind Moon-Sun Choi's back who's channeling his energy on drawing, suddenly, someone was grabbing his eyes and asking a silent question. Who would that be? - Aren't you In-Soon? - How did you know it was me? In-Soon by exposing her fresh body line as a mermaid in a bathing suit, smiles at Moon-Sun. Let's behave. Let's be a human being. Let's be a true human being by taking off the mask, called a human being, on top of a beast. Let the blood of Hye-Soon that went into my vein not be in vain. However, the fact that she gave her blood to an enemy like me would be the evidence that she still loves me, so would forgive me. For the one who gave her blood to me cusses at me, I cannot hear. Myung-Hee's here. I stand here waiting for you like this for a long time. Wind is blowing and brings your scent each time. Even a single drop of flower, sounds like your footstep. A Bird's whisper says it's your voice. I see your face inside the river, I listen to your voice. Even clouds, forests, stars and a lake have your face. In every single grain of sand, I see you. For everything has your face, For everyone breathes through you, I won't cry. Moon-Sun! Myung-Hee runs to Moon-Sun and throws her body at Moon-sun's chest. Myung-Hee! Are you really Myung-Hee? Is this for real? It's not a dream? Moon-Sun, too asks her like a crazy person with a choky voice Moon-Sun touches Myung-Hee gently with two hands who's now in his arms. Yes, it's Myung-Hee. Myung-Hee came. Here, like this in your arms. With a gentle smile, her face on Moon-Sun's chest tears drop with no reason from Myung-Hee's eyes. Moon-Sun hugs Myung-Hee with a rush. How did you find me? What made you come? He asks her in a trembling voice with excitement and joy. It's Myung-Hee, who's yours. I'll never lose you from my arms. Damn, it's freaking good. What, it's already over? Here, have it. Oh, shit! They're hot! Hey, why are you so excited? Our Emperor of the Great Japan Empire defeated the American allies in order to protect this land of Asia We conquered the continent of China and swept away every other country. Manila in January, Singapore in February, Rangoon in March The day that Asia under one rein is coming very soon. [The Monthly All Over Korea] Excuse me. Where's the office of All Over Korea magazine? This is the office. Thank you. - Wait. - Yes? - Aren't you Doo-hand Kim? - Yes. Please learn to read. Can I help you? I came here to see Mr. Gye-Joo Park. Mr. Park! Another fan of yours came. You came. I am so sorry that I didn't recognize you that day. No, I think I was too drunk. I read Pure Love. It was great. You, you read my novel? Of course, pretty much everyone read that book. If you read my book, then it must've been a huge hit. Did you really read the book? I came here because I wanted to hear about my father. You, the son of the Admiral Kim doesn't hear his news? No, I don't. Your father passed away by a bullet of a traitor. I'm sorry? The admiral who thought it'd be impossible to realize the dream of an independent country in a short amount of time only by force, postponed his military act and concentrated on the ideology education and a self-government campaign for the immigrants. January 24th of year 1930, On the way to his house located at San-Shi Station, by traitors like ll-Sung Kim and Sang-Si! Park who used to be his men but turned into communist members of the North shot him several times and murdered him - Hey, Dog meat - Huh? Did you meet with a novelist named, Gye-Joo Park? Yeah, why? We drank at a Jap bar last night and ran into Officer, Kunimoto there. He told you not meet with him anymore. - Why? - He's got suspicious ideology. We would have to beat him up one day. - Sure, I'll accept you as my brother. - Thank you. Hey, you guys. Come over here. I decided to have him as my big brother. - Say hello, - Nice to meet you. He's coming. I invited him. Have a seat. Come here. Come closer. Don't try to move. What's the matter? I wanted to live as a true human being. I wanted to stand in this world on my own eating food with my own money. Dong-Hae, let's live here in Jong-Lo together. You and he can make a very powerful pact. I cannot change my boss. It's a forbidden rule in my world. You can be the boss. - Me? - Yeah. Then you don't have to change a boss. - I am not a boss type. - Which country were you born? Forget it. Which one's more important, your people, or the rules of Yakuza's? You're now being a traitor trying to follow a worthless rule of gangsters. That's enough, Mr. Park. There are many men who act like bats. They are the worst kind of traitors of our nation. Mr. Park is right. I've lived my life wrong. Doo-Han's no different, either. He used his fist for himself not for the people of Korea. My only goal in life was to get out of poverty and loneliness. I didn't care what was going on in this world. This world abandoned us first, what was I supposed to do? It's not because of this world. It's because of the Japs. That's right. I am a nark of the Japs. My husband was an assistant of the Japanese military police, too. He was used and kicked out of the force and then stoned to death by other Koreans. I hope you don't walk the same path of my husband's. - Do you think I can be saved? - Yes, you can be saved. Hold your chin up and change if you think something's not right. This knife is the symbol of the Honmazi Gang. Why are you doing this? I am leaving the gang. Would you rather cut my throat by working under Do-Kang Kin? I won't belong to any gang. I'll leave this meaningless world of fighting behind. Then, what will you do? - I'll go to Manchu. - Manchu? There should be something I can do. I see. Then, you know what to do when you leave the gang? You'd better be on time. Always late, gambling... Go inside and change! - Alright, alright. - O.K... - Did you win any? - No way. Nothing. I came here to see Ms. Chae-Hwan Song. She's been sick for days. Maybe she'll be back today. - Dad, let's go home. - Hush! Look, where it's going. O.K. Well, where's this one going? Here it goes. Oh, you lost. Bring him to me. I'll beat him up myself. - Dong-Hae's here in town. - What? Dong-Hae... Congrats on your escape from the Hayashi gang. You paid the big price... Now, you're a member of Jong-Lo gang. I swore not to fight again. Please just leave me alone. How's Chae-Hwan? It was a cold. She's fine, now. Good. I was lost for a while after my husband died. Mr. Park let me stay here. What's your plan, now? - I'll go to Manchu as soon as possible. - Manchu? - It's far, isn't it? - It's my second hometown. What will you do there? Well... I used to work in a dumpling store before. Mr. Park promised me to write a recommendation letter so that I can enroll in a military school. Great. Someday, make a triumphant entry back to Korea by being a general. If you can wait for me till that time. What do you mean? I lost to Doo-Han in a fist fight, but don't wanna lose my love to him. I love you. You guys seem to take money from everyone. Be careful. The police's watching us. - Especially, Washington. - Yes, boss. - Dog meat! - Yes, boss. You guys be careful, alright? - Yes, boss - Yes, boss. - Brother, this is Big wart. - What are you doing here? Bother, please accept me. - What about Dong-Hae? - He's going to Manchu with a woman named, Chae-Hwan Song from Myung-Sung bar. What? With her? When are we leaving? We would have to wait a bit longer to find a person who'll help us pass the board. I'm bored. - Don't you regret? - What do you mean? I am a woman with a flaw and you are a bachelor. Dong-Hae Kim! You and I must have a bad karma together. What would you do if I like her as mush you do? Love isn't a fight that you can win or lose. It's something that sincere people get together naturally. Are you saying that I'm not sincere enough? Sing Empty Heart, together. My life, my way that's been flowing along with wind and clouds. Though twisted and hurt I've lived my life to the fullest. I live for the justice with a firm fist. A cold street that I turned to with empty hands. A lonely street lamp, do you know? This empty heart of mine... - Hello, Mr. Kin - Yeah. - A bottle of whiskey here. - A whiskey here. I wanna talk to Ms. Sezco. It's not possible. She's with the generals. I beg you, Mr. Kin Bring her to me right now. Ms. Sezco Excuse me. Please go back. They are the Japanese generals who are heading to Manchu. Don't get yourself into trouble. Sit down! You can't do this. I am sorry. What the... I am so sorry. I stepped on your foot. You barbaric Jap bastard... Clean my shoe! What? Son of a bitch! Do-Kang Kin, you beat the Great Japanese generals? Explain why your did it. What would you do if someone attacks you with a sword when you're not armed? It's because they attacked him with swords when he wasn't armed. It's not possible. Military Police is like an extraterritoriality ground. Do you even know what MP's like? Please. You're our brother. - Use your connections. What? Please brother, help us. I'm Captain Maruoka from Jong-Lo police station. I brought a cooperation request from the chief. What's going on, Sergeant Yamamoto? This chap from Jong-Lo Police station brought this piece of paper and wants Do-Kang Kin out. Stuff like that doesn't work here. Do you understand, Maruoka? Kin is a hero of Jong-Lo area that everyone admires. For the inner line consistency, It'll be better to... You fool! The army exists above the law. The only force that can rule us is the Emperor of Japan. Go back. - Hello, Captain - Good to see you again. I'm very sorry for making you come out here - when you're busy studying. - No Problem. Thank you for inviting a military man like myself to this intelligent gathering. - How's your newspaper? - I'll introduce them to you. This is the chief of the Jong-Lo merchants union. This is Gye-Joo Park, an author of Pure Love. You haven't changed your name yet... It's honor to meet a popular novelist like you. So, what's the deal? Well, let's have a drink, first. - Cheers! - Cheers! Do I know you, Ms.? I'm a wife of an MP assistant, Mazmura Shigeo. Mazumura? Who was murdered by a hermit last winter... Oh, Mazumura's wife... Yes, You invited me and comforted me with a gift of money back then. Well, you still haven't lost your beauty. By the way, what made you attend this gathering? I have a favor to ask you of Doo-Han Kim. Boss, welcome back. Welcome back. - Tell him that I came. - Yes, sir. I got out, thanks to you. Thank you, brother. A great man never acts out easily. - Please do remember this! - Yes, brother. To get you out, many people had hard time. Even Chae-Hwan... Where's she? She left with a note that she'll visit her family. Why, did you guys fight? Someday, you or Dong-Hae should go visit her. - What happened? - I'm leaving tomorrow to Manchu. Wasn't she supposed to go with you? We promised, but everything evaporated. - What are you talking about? - It's all because of you! She gave herself to the MP chief to get you out and that's why she left town. - Here you go. - Thanks. Hey, you! You! Come here! Come here you! Excuse me? - Where are you from? - I'm from Suwon... I saw you with lots of money. Give it to me! What for? What do you mean, what for? Because we need money. It's for my father's medicine. Medicine! My father needs medicine, too! - Oh, No! - You asshole... - No... - You little... Stay still. - I said no! - Don't move! You bastard! Hey, come, come! Shit! We should be careful next time. I should take an x-ray picture to know for sure, but I think it's a backbone fracture. Move him to a bigger hospital where there's a proper equipment for this. And if there's a rupture of internal organs it'll be a bigger problem. Oh my god... Operation charges can't be that expensive. There's a Jap trading company called East Trade in Incheon. I think they smuggle opium. What do you think? Let's steal their shit. I think I heard about that, too. You're trying to rob a place? Grandma, who am I? I'm Doo-Han. I never steal or rob anything and you know it. - Who is it? - I came to run an errand from Hayashi. Hello, he's taking a bath right now. Yes...Yes, I see. A call from Boss Doyama. What? Hello, Hayashi speaking. Yes. Yes. Yes, boss. Was it a direct call from Boss? It was... Is everything alright? His company was attacked by someone. Who the hell is he? So, the outcome is? We found all out. Present. Yes, it's Do-Kang Kin. - Do-Kang Kin? - Yes. He didn't seem to know that the company was involved with our boss. Are you defending him? I just wanted to make the situation clear. There's any other choice. We attack around 5 O'clock in the morning. Why don't you rest for a day or so? It'll take some time for me to gather my men and it'd be better to let the MP know. We don't need your men or the Military Police... When in Rome, do as the Romans do. Now is not a very good time. It'll be better to get a consent first... I've never gotten a permission from the MP in my life. Do you understand, Hayashi? I do it my way. Do you agree? I do. I won't contradict you for the old time's sake... Friendship, that's right. Hayashi, we're friends. Now, take us to a good bar. - For our victory, cheers! - Cheers! - Sasaki. - Yes, boss! Show us your skills. Yes, boss. There's no way that Do-Kang Kin can defeat him. Excuse me, where's Do-Kang Kin? Look! Who's she? Who is she? Oh my god, you! Sezco! - I have something to tell you. - Yes? There'll be an attack from Hayashi gang tomorrow at dawn. We have no time. For Hammer, Shigumoon gang, Jong-Lo, for Little Yeongdeungpo. And Dog meat, Mapo Mapo, little WangSimNi Yong-Gun, you contact brother Jum-Su and find brother Hu-Ok Kim. Gather everyone by four in the morning. - Now, go. - Yes, boss. - Thank you, Sezco - Doo-Han, please win. - Here, in the back - I see. - No, not there. He's not here. - Look for him! Doo-Han Kim! Hurry! Find him! I don't see anyone. It's an MP! Run! Run! Do-Kang Kin. You come here. I told you not to get into trouble. You are standing in the way of my career. You! This is not a joke. You'll never be able to come out here, again. Give me your hand. Your hand, now! You bastard! Kunimoto, you asshole. Isn't your last name Lee? Kunimoto means the foundation of the nation. Torturing Koreans when you're a royal descendant. You should die! Come here. Please let me go. Ready! They were blank shots before but we're loaded with live bullets now. Get out of the way! [The End]
