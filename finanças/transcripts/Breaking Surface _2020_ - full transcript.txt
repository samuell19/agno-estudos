Mother! - Help! - Is Tuva here? Where is Tuva? - Is Tuva here? Where is she? - We should swim under the jetty. Tuva, I'm here. Come on. Come on, Tuva! Come on. Come on! Tuva ... Ida, you should take care of her! You should look after her! If she had died, it would have been your responsibility! Mother. You know what, honey? It's in the middle of the night. You must sleep. - Are you swimming? - I need to dive. - With Tuva and Grandma. - Are you wearing socks then? Yes, otherwise you get cold feet, but there are rubber socks. You get to go out and dive when you get a little bigger. Where should we stay when you and Dad get divorced? - Who said we should get divorced? - Erik says you have to get divorced. That's why Dad lives in the other room. We are not to be separated. Everything is going to be OK. Parole. - Here. And you wear lingerie? - I'm thinking warmly. - In here it holds 30 degrees. - It is not needed in the Philippines. Four months of easy money. You're stupid doing this all winter. A last ice bath. The main propeller looks okay. Slight minor damage to one and three. Nothing strange. - Okay. Continue to the bow thruster. - On the way. Promotion. - Confirm stop in the machine. - Yes. It is confirmed. Diving in the tube. - How does it look? - The usual shit. Ropes. Garn. It takes fifteen minutes. It's freezing here. I should have put on other underwear. Shouldn't you think warm? In four days ... ... you have to do this yourself. The surface? The propeller moved. - Does the bridge know I'm here? - Could it be the current? There is no power here. The propeller rotated. It was mechanical movement. The propeller goes! - Tuva! - Let me go! It wasn't anyone's fault. - Tuva! - Stop! - Tuva! - Let go! - Ida! - Hey. - Morn. Early start? - Not when you have young children. - What's with your hand? - Nothing. We'll take your cases. Mom is waiting. Mor! - Hi, Tuva. - Hi! - Hey, Ida. - Hey. Hi, my girl. You have to come a little more often and visit me. Knut! Knut! Knut! So nice to have you both here, for once. We have to spend a weekend together, and dive and be in nature, - - and be present in our soul ... - How are the kids? - Good. They are so big now. And Einar, then? It goes well. We go into therapy. Did your father suggest that? He always wanted us to. Therapy for ages. One cannot speak to love anyone. Either it's there or it's not there. Don't be like your dad. - Just watch things break. - We continue the therapy. No one comes and helps you. Who should it be? And don't say you're doing it for the sake of the kids. Ida. I wouldn't be so harsh and strict. Pardon. That's not how it should be. - You can't dive with that cough. - Tea and some sleep, then it will be fine. We take it easy tonight. Why are you knocking? - What is it? - In the car today ... She can't take medicine and dive. Without it, she gets a little ... - Never mind. - You're better off dealing with her. More practice, maybe. Never mind. I was wondering if you might want to join Sweden after the dive. - The children miss you very much. - I'm going to the Philippines on Tuesday. Another time. Good night. Good night. ... first of the day. Later snow with poor visibility. Minus five degrees ... A hot tub is all she's going to dive in today. What the hell are you doing? Mother goes off the shaft if she notices that I smoke. - How long have you been doing that? - This is the second dog. Shall we go? Of ...? Wake up. Look. - Hi. Puncture? - Yes, but tow truck is on the way. - Do you have a spare wheel? - The help comes at any time. - We can't leave you here. - They're on their way. - Can you open? - Tuva, she wants to wait for help. It's magic. Yes ... Hey, hey. - Are you friends? - Sisters. - Or half-sisters. - Mother often went diving alone. Tuva. You can quit. They are here. Fuck the hell. Come on, Knut. It seems familiar. As far as I can remember , Mom was down there. It seems you and mom do a lot of things together. Do you need to wonder or dive? Her. Knut! The dive company has so much stuff that no one counts. Did you rap them? Wireless communication. I haven't dived with a full mask in a long time. Come on, surpomp. It's easy. Knut! Come. Sit. Come on. Knut. Come on. Where's your phone? Check battery and signal. I have 80% battery and 3/4 signal. Okay, we have satellite phone too. Shit. We have to put things under the overhang. We are going 14 meters down here, along the wall. The flow begins around the headland . You must have it open. The crack system rises to five meters. This is our safety stop. - Okay? - Okay. Diver 1 is connected. In case something goes to hell. - Ida, are you in? - I come. - It's a bit weird. - Take it easy. It expands a little further ahead. It's a tight passage, and then it gets bigger. Can you swim a little quieter so I can keep up? That was exactly where Mom and I were. Just a little more. Narrow passage. Okay, here it is. Stop here and you'll see something. Press out some air in the ceiling. Why? Why do you make everything so difficult? - Stop it! Leave my gear! - Do what I said. Press out air. It's enough. Come. You can't breathe here. You get carbon monoxide poisoning. It's like a diving bell. We may be here for a while. Look. Mom destroyed my diving knife when she made it. The first real thing I bought for my own money. I loved that knife. - What is it? - Nothing. Stop grumbling and mumbling. You two have always had something together that I couldn't get along with. - Here it is hewn in stone. - Give it to you, Ida. It wasn't something I chose. Is it my fault? This happens when families crack and people choose sides. As my kids now have to choose side and I can't do a shit! - It's happening again! - Stop it. What is going on? You said it went well. It's fucking bad. I'm freezing. Ida ... How much air do you have left? 55. - It's a little low. Are you cold? - Yes, of course I freeze. Three minute security stop, and then we go up. Ida, se that! Fy fader. They are not dangerous, just curious. Answer. They talk to you. - Why did they stab? - Who knows? Watch out! Hell! - Did it go well? - That hurt. - We go up without a safety stop. - Tuva! Tuft! Back! Tuft! I'm coming, Tuva! Tuft! Tuft! I am stuck! Light up your flashlight so I can see where you are. - Ida, shut up. - I can not see you. Shut up! We have to keep calm. Do you understand that? What depth are you at? - 22 meters. - Okay. Listen up. I am stuck. Take it easy. Save on air. - Swim down to the bottom. - Okay. One thing at a time. You just go down to the bottom. Nothing else. Just keep going down. Near the wall, I think. - I'm down. - Good. What depth are you at? 33 meters! Tuva, we can't be down here. Take it easy. There are margins. Light 360 degrees around with the flashlight. - Can you see me? - No. Do you have a line for the marker buoy in the pocket of your leg? Yes I think so. I got this one. Attach the line to something wherever you are. You have to work fast and find me before you run out of air. - Swim no more than 20 meters. - Which way? Just choose. To the left. - Tuva, can't you get loose? - No, I'm stuck. - I should be crushed. - You have to try to get rid of it. - It doesn't work. - I swam 20 meters. - I can not see you. - Okay, please. Attach the line again. Don't run away. You have to be quick. I can't be far away. Just continue. Tuva, I can't see anything. Only rocks have a break, everywhere. - How much air do you have? - 35 bar. I'll be running out soon. Okay. Take it easy. Breathe calmly. You have to save on air. You have to find me before you run out. Ida! I see the light from your lantern. Continue. There you are. I see you. - Take it easy. - No no no. - OMG. - Listen to me. - We have to get the stone away! - Ida, shut up! - Finally. We can't move the stone. - We gotta get you out! Take it easy now! We must get it away, Tuva! - Sorry! - We can't move the stone. Take it easy. It goes well. Ida, get along. There are things we need to do. - We have to get you away, Tuva. - One thing at a time. Okay? In the pocket on my right leg there are marker lights. You have to mark the spot and then you have to call and call for help. Afterwards you dive down to me with extra air. There are two bottles right at the dive site. You should attach the line to the marker buoy here with me. Fill the buoy with air so that it rises to the surface. Afterwards you go up without a safety stop. When you are up, call for help. Ida? You can do this. Just call for help. I'm okay. Up to the surface now. Come on. Your dive computer will notify you of a safety stop. - Never mind. There are margins. - There came the warning of a safety stop. Never mind. Take a longer stop on the next dive. - Get up and call for help. - Okay, I'm going up now. Okay ... No no no! Fuck ... There have been stone races up here too. The phones and bottles are broken. - Can you get it out? - Everything's gone. - Tuva! - There are two bottles in the car. - The car keys are under the stones. - Crush box! Take the jack in the trunk. Set a timer. You have a neighborhood. Lift the stone with the jack. For the car, fast! Luggage room, Luggage room. What the hell ...? The luggage compartment. No no no. Fuck the hell. No, fuck! Shit! Oh my God. REAR SEAT RELEASE Help! Help! House ... there. One kilometer. - Tuva, I'm here. - You got the cases? - I didn't open the trunk. - Did you bring the air bottles? Help! - Tuva! - I'm running out of air soon. Tuva, it came a plane. I don't know if they saw me. You must come down now. I'm almost at zero. The plane! It's back! - Hell! - Light your emergency fire! I haven't. I lit it in town. Listen. I'm at zero. I run out at any time. The plane turns. They've seen me. - Tuva! - Diver disconnected. 30 seconds, I'm coming! Tuva, I'm coming. Can you hear me? I'll be there soon. Okay? I lost the second bottle when I had to notify the aircraft. I have to find it. I'll leave my air bottle here with you. Okay? I couldn't find my way back. I couldn't find you. I connect your mask to the bottle. We have to hurry. The plane is up there. It works. The plane is up there circling. They saw me and came back. - I need to get up again. We have to hurry. - Yeah, okay. Get up! Come on! Up with you! Ida, this time you have to take a safety stop. Why? I was only down for a few minutes. I need to get up. The plane is up there. We can't wait. - No, you have to stay three meters. - Okay, I'm three feet. - How long must I stay? - It's way off the table. - The plane is circling up there. - You need to make a safety stop. - There are margins. I have to get up now! - Ida, no! - No no no! - What is it? Fuck the hell! The plane is gone! What do we do now? - Tuva, what are we doing now? - You have to get the jacket in the car. It doesn't work. I've tried. But it is a house on the map. - Pick up the jack and lift the stone. - No, the house is much better. - I can get help. - No one will come and help us. Get the jack in the car. We manage this ourselves. Shut up, Knut! Shut up! Hello? Hello? Fuck ... The dog? Hi, the dog. Calm. Funny. Fuck ... No, fuck, not the suit ... Skype, Skype, Skype ... Skype. Plug in Eyvind's mobile. Plug in Eyvind's mobile. Fuck the hell! Damn shit! Shit! DIVES STAND ON 33 METERS RING 112 !! Greedy Norwegians. Where the fuck is the jackal ...? Dot ring spray. Tape, tape, tape. Okay. Okay. Tuva, there was no jack there, but I have a break bar. - I'm trying to lift the stone with it. - Just get me out. It's cold. - Have you changed the bottle? - It's a little old in my old age. This one is almost full. Tuva. This is the one we have. - Now we lift the stone with it, okay? - Okay, just get me loose. Okay. Come on, Tuva! Push! - Is it moving? - No. - I use too much air. - How much? - 20 bar. We'll try again. - Okay. Okay, Tuva. En, to ... Come on! Sorry, Tuva! - Is it moving? - No, not a jerk. I need more time. I connect on the other air bottle. What's wrong? - It doesn't open. - Is it stuck? I lost it and only checked the screw, but not the valve. - Something must have broken. - Isn't it moving? It just goes around without resistance. Hell! Breathe calmly. How much air do you have? I only have three to four minutes left. Once again with the breaker bar. Find a new place. Okay, are you ready, Tuva? Push now. Push! Come on! Sorry, Tuva! No no no. Take your jacket! Push it under the rock and fill it with air! - But I almost have no air. - Just do it now! - The safety valve opens! - Cover it! - You can't, damn it! - Cover it! It doesn't work. I'm almost out of air. You have to choose. I can stay here and breathe with your air. Or go up and see if anyone is coming. It doesn't work. If you go straight up you will die. You have 15-20 minutes left. Someone can come and save us. Hold on, Ida. It doesn't work. When you run out of air, you take mine. So you can live. Just stay here until it's over. In. It is okay. I'm so sorry it's not Mom who's here. I want it to be you. Take the air! Are you giving up too? - You have to decompress. - Excuse me for leaving you. Stop it. You have made too many ascents. If you go up now, you die before entering a pressure chamber. - How did you go when you showed up? - Not good. - Have you hurt anywhere? - In the shoulder and arm. You must be down here for at least 30 minutes. That's what we have. Stay down there for as long as you can. Then you go up. I'm waiting for you and I'm leaving you ashore. Be careful not to get carbon monoxide poisoning. - Count every third number backwards. - Okay, see you up there. See you soon. 97. 94. 91. 88. 85. 82. 79. I can bring air from the surface. - It can give you some extra time. - Wait! We have air, after all. The broken air bottle down there is almost full. We just have to break it all in here. 60 seconds. One two three four five ... ... seven, eight ... We must go down. The air is getting bad. We made it! Ida. Ida? Ida? Ida! Ida! Ida ... Translation: Tron Furu Scandinavian Text Service
