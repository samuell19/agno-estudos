What's wrong with ya? Britney and myself, we had the, you know what I mean, the, the talk talk last night. What kind of talk talk is that? The commitment talk. Either she’s willing to commit to us, or we got to go our own ways. You Yanks and yer emotions. I am mostly Irish though. You’re from Connecticut. Yeah but my grandmothers on my mother’s side Britney’s eighteen years old Declan, what did you expect? Look, Hayley’s calling again. She's to young man. It’s not her age that’s the problem, it’s her father. He’s had it out for me since day one. Hmmm... That’s the thing with American women. They listen to their fathers. You’d never get that shite back in Ireland, it’d be like water off a duck’s back. When did you meet him? I haven’t. She told me that he said I’m too old for her. You are. And too worthless apparently. I don’t know if I’d call you too worthless. A lowlife Irish shithead he said. You’re not Irish though. Where’s he from? Dublin. Of course. We need to move out of Woodlawn man. That’s the problem. I didn’t move all the way to America... to be practically living in Ireland. We haven’t been to Manhattan in months. Come on, Manhattan is overrated. And what the fuck is the Bronx? There's... there’s Tayto’s behind the bar. I might as well be sipping pints in Rathmore. Did narcolipty pass out again did he? Either that or he’s dead. He’d be better off dead. He’s in here drinking tonic water for the last two months judging the rest of us and now look at the cut of him. I’d swear he’s dead you know? He’s not dead. Is he? Eoin are you dead? Are you dead Eoin? Fuck off. I told you he wasn’t dead. Alright, should we go home? We will. Or, or, we have one more? We’ll have one more so. ♪♪In the merry month of June, now from me home I started Left the girls of Tuam, some were nearly broken-hearted Saluted father dear, kissed me darling mother and drank a pint of beer, me grief and tears to smother Then off to reap the corn leave where I was born Cut a stout, black thorn to banish ghosts and goblins A brand-new pair of brogues to rattle over the bogs And frighten all the dogs on the rocky road to Dublin A-one, two, three, four, five Hunt the hare and turn her down the rocky road And all the ways to Dublin, whack, follol de-rah.

We went to the diner. For four hours? Well we were at the bar too. It closes at four. Apologies, detective. I was about to leave and then the lads came in for a nightcap. What lads? Declan and Eoin. Eoin’s drinking again? What’s it to you what Eoin’s doing? What happened to your not drinking at work? >It was a once off Haley. >>It isn't a once off if you're doing it 5 nights a week Jesus Christ. Nag nag nag that’s all you do. Shut the hell up. Nag nag nag. It doesn’t stop, repeat, perpetual complaining, an everlasting bellyache. Nag nag nag. That's what you're like. A god damn broken record. A fucking, fucking parrot with a limited vocabulary. Nag nag nag, nonstop every… What's this? I'm done naggin. Define done. I'm walking out the door and i'm never coming back. Where you goin? It’s none of your business where I’m going. OH! Oh, so all that “till death do us part” stuff, that was just bullshit, huh!? Shut up James. Through the good times and the bad... You gave up on this long before i did. We’ve been through worse than this. And everything is exactly the same. You’re overreacting. Will you stop for fucks sake? Fuck you. So I came home late. You’re making a... Fuck you. You said that already. So that's how it is huh? Fine. Good riddance! Don’t you dare. You know how much I spent on that thing? That’s fifteen grand you just tossed out the feckin’ window. You know what? Fine. Get out! I'd be better out with out ya. Haley come back! Haley! Haley! Are you at least going to take the fucking cat? What’s the craic Frank? The head on you. How was last night? I havent seen that clown in weeks. No? No. You haven't seen him? Sure that’s what I’m feckin’ telling you isn’t it? He wasn’t in here sipping pints last night so? Your American accent is getting out of control, Frank. I haven’t seen Eoin since Halloween. You know I have cameras in here, right? Sure those things haven’t worked in years. I had them rectified last week. Oh you had them rectified? I did. And why didn’t you notify me that you were after having them rectified? I didn’t think my own nephew would have anything to hide. So you’ve been spying and creeping on me here all week, like a mad man huh. Where are you going? Will you take that out and answer it? For fucks sake Eoin. You’ve no papers. How are you going to get a new job if he fires you? Well. What’s the craic man? Timmy Thomas. Declan. What are you having? Ah throw us on a pint there Horse Box. You know you're not supposed to be letting him drink, he can’t handle his drink. He showed up drunk, what was i supposed to do at that point. Why am i here? The numbers are gone to shite, they’re all over the fucking shop, and If I don’t do something soon I’m gonna lose the bar. You’re about to get a ten grand tip out from the Super Bowl boxes. Don’t be looking at me for sympathy. I can’t be relying on gambling money to keep the place open. Then have a staff meeting. Why am I the only prick here? I watched you and those two eejits drink two bottles of whiskey last night. And not a dime rang into the feckin’ box? I was under the impression I was entitled to a staff drink. You're a thief. Drinking isn't stealing Frank. Come on. I’m sorry James but, you're fired. Stop it for fucks sake. You’re gone. Piss off. I'm your nephew. I have to put the bar first. Over family? Yeah, or I’ll lose both. Fuckin hell. What would my mother say if she could see you now huh? With that greedy look of a pavey in your eye. She’d be mortified if she saw you. You moved here to write and you’ve done feck all except drink. I barely have a hundred dollars in the bank. I warned you not to blow all your money. And Haley left! Well what did you... She moved out and everything. What did you expect? Loyalty, devotion. Call me crazy but I wanted a loyal wife. You’ve been cheating on her for years. I’ve done no such thing. Sure you’ve rode nearly every bird that’s come in here. That’s why we have no regulars, you’re riding them and then blowing them off. Even the Chinese woman at the laundromat knows that. Li is a nosey bitch. The whole of Woodlawn knows what you’re at. Do you know what? Fuck Woodlawn. And fuck you too Frank. I don’t need this job. Wait. What!? American women don’t understand the drinking you see. Sure I suppose how could they? The ex was always complaining until she was told to pack up her belongings and get the fuck out. >Oh she was. People always think Timmy Thomas is a push over but the truth of the matter is they all have the wrong impression of him. Timmy Thomas is no stooge. You’re a quiet lad so are yah? My cousin Jimmy Jones doesn’t have much to say either, but a big, big IRA man though. Will he top up that pint to fuck? Do you have a green card or are you illegal? Timmy Thomas married a lesbian there a few years ago so he’s sorted out now. Jesus, Timmy Thomas was illegal for a long time before that. Sorry, undocumented is the politically correct term, isn’t that right? Tis hard on the old self esteem though. Now. Will you take a drink? I will. Aye And one for John Wayne here too. That's with Timmy Thomas. Now just call Jim. Don’t be sitting here depressed all night. You’re doing nothing but bringing negative energy to the place and I gotta tell you Eoin, people don’t like it. Who’s Jim? Jim the Bollox. I hear he’s an awful prick. He is, but so are landlords. He fired you? He will if he doesn’t call him. Ahhh, look who decided to show his face. What are you doin? I can see that Eoin. Did you call Bollox? Did he fuck? He’s been calling me looking for you all day. For the last two months you’re as self righteous and judgmental as Bono, and now look at the cut of him, huh. You’re in no position to be saying anything. You were fired this morning. Where'd you hear that? Frank came by earlier collecting Super Bowl money. You bought the last box? I split it with Britney. How does she have five hundred dollars? Her auld boy’s loaded. Auld boy. He’s from Connecticut. Come here a sec. I need fucking money man. Yea. I heard Hayley moved out. Frank needs to keep his mouth shut. Nah, she posted that on Facebook. Posted what? Just she’s looking for a new place to live. Oh. Something about you being a dickhead. Here let me read it to you. Hi everyone, I’m looking for a one bedroom apartment or a studio to rent. James is a delinquent and won’t be moving with me. Sorry delinquent, not a dickhead. You know what she’s like, she’s like a fucking parrot. Not for nothin, but the fact that parrots can speak English is vastly overlooked. I’m Timmy Thomas. Will you take a drink? I won't, no. Aye you will. I just said i won't Give him a drink. You’ve just lost your wife and your job today. What else do you have to lose at this point? Slainte. I need a job man. Eileen is hiring. Who’s Eileen? From Eileen's. I'm not working at a fucking cafe. >What are you doing? I'm making lattes. You have to add milk. I know that i just hadn't done it yet. Alright, I got to step out for a bit. Are you going to be able to handle this? Of course I can. Oh come on you know you're beautiful. I mean it's just... Look as much as I love taking your money, you have got to get a job man. Or at least a hobby or something. How's your seventeen year old girlfriend doing? She is eighteen and keep your fucking voice down. >Alright, what are you having? >>Just a tonic water. >Oh you're off it? >>Aye. Have you seen James? Yeah he’s working over at Eileen’s. >The diner? >>Yea. What happened the bar job? Do you not remember? How are you darlin? Oh hey. How you doing Tim? Timmy Thomas is majestic. How we doing Timmy Thomas? Fabulous. Back up Tammy Smoke for me. No bother. >Eoin will you take a... >>Oh he's off it. Well, give him an orange or something. Timmy Thomas was hoping he’d run in to you. He has a business opportunity that requires proposing. What type of business opportunity? More will be revealed. What sort of proposal? Who the fuck was that? Hey, um. Can you give me a minute? Jesus Christ give me a second. What are you working on? Final draft of a suicide letter. Is that supposed to be a joke? Just a vanilla milkshake please. Oh the uh... blender thing is broken. I can give you a scoop of ice cream and a glass of milk if you like? I’ll have a tea. What brand? Peppermint. Peppermint. Where did you see peppermint? There. We’re out of it. The peach then. Out of it. Anything fruity? We only have Irish tea and it isn’t fruity. Irish tea is fine. Am I seeing things or are you not blacked out? I’m back on the wagon. Stay on it this time. Are you not going to say hello to Timmy Thomas? Hello Timmy Thomas. How's the form Horse box? It's going. Do you know where the term “On the Wagon” comes from? Back in Medieval Times if you were caught stealing or murdering or whatever it was, they’d make a show of you. A complete fucking mockery. They’d beat you senseless. And then as you made your way down to be hung to death, the hangman would offer you a final drink. However, if they beat you so badly you couldn’t walk or stand up they would put you on a wagon and wheel you down. But, they wouldn’t offer you a drink, if you were on the wagon. That was a very interesting albeit irrelevant story. Timmy Thomas is full of great stories so. And business opportunities. Especially business opportunities. Should Timmy Thomas tell him or will you Eoin? Timmy Thomas got a tip on a horse tomorrow. I'll tell him. Misty Button. Thirty five to one, and it's a dead cert. A forgone conclusion. There’s no such things as guarantees when you’re betting on animals. Believe as you will but you’ll believe tomorrow. It doesn’t matter either way. All we have to do is put the bet on. How do you mean? Timmy Thomas knows a bookie in Harlem that takes big action. Large fucking action. But he’s not allowed in there. So Timmy Thomas is gonna pay us to put ten grand on the horse for him. How much? Five hundred. Each. Why does it take two people to put a bet on? Because you have a car. You could take a train. With ten grand in my arse pocket? Take a cab. When Misty Button comes in he’ll have a lot more than ten grand in his arse pocket. They’re not gonna let you leave three hundred grand cash. Thant's what i said. Large fucking action. How shady are these people? They’re not shady at all, just honest hard working bookies. But why aren’t you allowed in the place so if they’re so honest and hardworking? He rode the bookies wife. A few times. Timmy Thomas does a ton of riding. Think of this as my amends to you for you losing your job. Even though it was kind of your own fault. You're sober for five minutes and you're making amends already? Are you in or not? Timmy Thomas! Okay, okay. Johnny and Joe. Got it. Wait, what? You said 12:30 man. Fucks sake are you taking the piss or what? Alright, don’t worry about it. We’ll wait. We'er not going to get drunk. Relax. What? The race isn't for another two hours. He said 12:30. I know he did. He misread the times. No smoking in the fucking car man. I just spent thirty dollars on airfreshener. Now what? I say we just go in there. Get settled. You'll be rotten by two o'clock. I’m off the gargle man. When I’m sober I’m fucking sober, you know that. Alright, well good luck in there. You're not coming? I have to stay and mind the car. You can park it. It costs three dollars an hour down here man, fuck that. You're making five hundred, you cheap prick. What about you Johnny? Do i know you? Aye. I was in here last week so i was. What are you having? Just a tonic for me. I'm off it ya see. My pal here, he will have a beer though so he will. You're a good lad Johnny. So what brings you two in? We might take a little action with Joe over there, so we just might. What the hell is that? What the hell is what? Is that Timmy Thomas? Where? The fucking picture on the wall. Aye, it sure looks like him. Why do they have a picture of Timmy Thomas? Beats me. Johnny, tell me this. What's the story with the boy in the picture? Does he own the place or something? Who? Timmy Thomas? He's a fucking loser. Why's that? Terrible gambler. He used to come in here and drop twenty G’s a week. A sad individual. Sounds sad alright. What’s he doing with himself now? Not sure. Joe had to ban him. That’s the wall of shame, everybody on this wall is banned for life. Why would you uh... ban a fella dropping that kind of cash? The well went dry. Yeah it went dry. A loser like that, it's not sustainable. What? >You know him or something? >>No no no not at all. Absolutely not. A sure thing. He's about to lose another ten grand. Aye. We’ll get paid regardless though. This is probably everything he has. What are you saying? Nothing. No, say it. You think he’s gonna try and rip us off. I don’t even know him. He’s not like that. If he doesn’t pay us I’ll murder him so I will. We’ll take out the five hundred each so. If Misty Button wins we can always say we thought that was the arrangement. If that’s what you want to do man. He’s your friend. We’re not friends. Well he’s your, whatever he is. He’s a fucking loser so he is. I wasn’t going to say anything, but yeah he really is. Aye, big time man. Johnny, give us a couple of shots, two beers and tell me this, which one of these boys is dealing coke? I thought you were off it? That was when I was broke. Aye he’s a fucking loser man, you saw it. His picture is on the wall for fucks sake. I knew he was a loser from the day I met him. Right?! Same. I had the exact same feeling so I had. A fucking loser man. And what was with all that Medieval Times bullshit? You know what i mean? On the wagon. A feckin’ clown. Jesus Christ and now he’s about to give these fuckers another nine grand. Haha. Aye. We should do him a favor and not even put the bet on. How do you mean? Misty Button is thirty five to one for a reason man. It’s not gonna win, it’s not gonna win, do you know what I mean? So you’re saying we shouldn’t put the bet on? I’m not saying anything. This is your thing I’m just the driver, but... Five thousand would be a lot more than five hundred. I didn’t realize you were a mathematician Eoin, do you know what I mean? Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, haaaa. We should just keep the money. What if Misty Button wins? We have ten minutes to decide. We’ll play it by ear. Good idea yeah, good idea. We’ll buy another bag of coke anyway aye. Definitely, definitely. Joe has good stuff. It’s fucking breathtaking. Ha, ha. ha, ha, ha. I say we say fuck it. Fuck what? Fuck Misty Button. If that’s what you wanna do kid. Let’s go in there, watch this godforsaken horse lose this race and leave with the other nine grand. >Deal? >>Deal. >And they're off. >Sweet Philip, Bobby Jean, Bunny Goodstuff and Mr Fox are out of the gate fast. Come on Mr. Fox. >Pineapple Sauce sits at Take it home foxy! > the back of the pack and is now out of sight. >*Mr Fox takes first place but... Brilliant. >...Bunny Goodstuff is only one lead from the front. So easy so it is. >*The outsider Misty Button is picking up... I’m texting Eileen my notice right now. >...pace coming to the center of the pack. >Bunny Goodstuff falls back and Sweet Phillip looks tired. >Bobby Jean takes second place. >Mr Fox’s lead is shorter... >and here comes Misty Button! >Coming down the last stretch and Misty Button is just one length back. >Bobby Jean falls back to third and Misty Button takes second place. I told you this was a bad idea. >Misty Button rushing like a freight train... When did you fucking say that? >in the night and has passed the champ, Mr Fox. >MISTY BUTTON, MISTY BUTTON, MISTY BUTTON WINS IT! >Oh oh oh oh! What a race! What the fuck are we gonna do? I’ll tell him we didn’t get the bet in. What else is there to say? He knows we got here two hours ago. I’ll tell him we went for a walk. How long of a walk? Over to the water. >Fuck, he’s calling me. >>Don't answer it. I have to. Timmy Thomas, what about you big fella? Aye, you called it. Unreal. James will never doubt Timmy Thomas again that’s for sure. Alright aye, see you then pal. What did he say? He wants us to stop by his place. I suppose we should give him back the thousand too right? Nah. Sure we spent half of it. He has to pay us whether or not the bet was put on. >Yeah? >>Yeah. Timmy Thomas is harmless. Come in! We did it lads! We fucking did it. Who dares doubt Timmy Thomas now huh? Was there any bother getting the money off Joe? A wee bit. Joe’s a dope, isn’t he? Aye. What’s with the long faces lads? We won big. We need to have a bit of a chat. A bit of a chat about what? We didn’t get the bet in. What the fuck are you talking about? We got there late. You were there at half twelve. Aye, but we went for a walk. A walk? Aye. How far of a fucking walk? >Over to the water. >>And down a bit. Down a bit, aye. You got me. Good one lads you fucking had me. We’re all dead. >What do you mean dead? >>Brown fucking bread dead. Why are we dead? That money didn’t belong to Timmy Thomas. Does it look like Timmy Thomas has ten grand to be betting on horses? >Who did it belong to? >>Fucking Alonzo. >Who's Alonzo? >>You don't want to know. We’re gonna have to pay him, you’re gonna have to pay him his winnings lads. Ten multiplied by thirty five... >Three hundred and thirty... >>Shut up! Three hundred thirty five thousand. We don’t have money like that. Neither of us even have jobs. We’re going to have to get out of town before he gets here. Who the fuck is Alonzo? It’s too late. To what? To anything. Oh Jesus. Did you three idiots not hear me knocking? We did Alonzo. You were too quick to open it. Can you put some fucking pants on? They’re in the wash Alonzo. I'm parked by the fire hydrant. Give me the money, I gotta get outta this dump. Give him his money. What’s this? They didn’t get the bet in on time. What do you mean they didn’t get the bet in? They were late. You said they arrived two hours early. They did, but they went for a walk. Are you fucking with me? How far did you fucking walk? To the water and down a bit. Timmy Thomas will shut his mouth and speak only when spoken to. There isn’t even ten grand in here. We took out our share first. The thousand Timmy Thomas promised us. You were supposed to put it all on Misty Button first for fucks sake. Timmy Thomas you had one fucking job. I’m sorry Alonzo. Do you know who I am? You? Okay then... ...let me introduce myself. Fucking Timmy Thomas. Any questions? You see it’s common courtesy in this country... ...that when when someone introduces themselves you return the gesture. I’m Eoin. Eoin McLaughlin right? From Falls Road Belfast. Is it that Eoin? Yeah your parents they own the pub underneath the house you grew up in right? John and Kathleen McLaughlin. Aye, that Eoin. You work for me now. And if you fuck around I’m gonna make what the IRA did look like a fucking wet t-shirt contest. Do you understand me? Aye. And you. What’s your name? You know my name. Oh a tough guy. Unless you want to be lying here with Timmy Thomas you’ll answer my questions. James. It couldn’t possibly be James Sheehan from Oakpark, Tralee? Could it? >What were the odds? >>About thirty five to one. The same James Sheehan whose sister works at the Aqua Dome? She is cute you know, a big juicy pair of tits on her. Aye. And the same James Sheehan whose father coaches the local football team. Pat, is that his name? Pat Sheehan? James, let me ask you something? Have you ever seen someone being tarred and feathered. I haven't. I have. Good, then you can fill him in. You work for me now too. ♪♪ I’m going to call you boys tomorrow at noon. Answer the phone or you’re gonna regret it. ♪♪ ♪♪ Now get the fuck outta here, I got work to do. Should we call the cops? >And say what? >>He killed Timmy Thomas. Fuck Timmy Thomas! Timmy Thomas is the reason we’re in this shit to begin with. >He said he’s going to tar and feather my father. >>I know. And my sister. You disrespect my sister like that again and I’ll break your fucking neck. Let’s get a drink? I’m hanging. I have to go to work. I thought you were quitting? That was when Misty Button was losing. You can’t go to work at a diner right now. Hey. How’s your day going? It’s none of your business how my day is going. Why, what did you hear? It was a figure of speech. What do you want? I will take a cup of coffee please? >Thanks. >>You’re welcome. You know that was very rude what you did last night, just walking out while I was making the tea. I had to take a call, plus you were taking your sweet time. Yeah it was busy. Thursday’s are always busy. Are you aware that there’s an H in Thursday? I am. Thurs. Say Thurs. That’s what I said. Ha. Try and say photosynthesis. Just drink your coffee will you? It’s too sweet. Whoa. Better. I can do a great Irish accent. You wanna hear it? Not really no. Ah sure look it, will you come here to me. Well, what did you think? You sound like the fat kid from lord of the rings. Everyone’s a critic. Why do Americans always act happy when they do an Irish accent? I mean this concept that Irish people are happy go lucky is baffling. I mean look at me. Do i look at all happy with life to you? You don't. Then why act happy when you do an Irish accent? And say fuck more. Ah fuck sure look it, will you come here to me. Come here to me to fuck. Ah fuck sure look it, will you come here to me to fuck. Improving. Why would you leave a country where people swear so eloquently? I came here to pursue a writing career. Hmmm... how's that working out? Pshhhh.... writings difficult. And this job is easy? This is just temporary. Sometimes temporary can last a long time. You have to be taking the piss. Hey Hayley. You work here? Yeah, it’s just temporary. What happened to your bar job? I quit. I couldn’t take that toxic environment anymore you know? Did you find a place to live? I’m staying with Regina. She’s the worst. She’s the best. All her bickering is the reason you left. Exactly. She's the best. You bitch. Stop it. What are you doing here anyway? You never used to come here. You used to call this place food for Peasants. This might be awkward, but I sort of have a guy meeting me. As in a date? Yeah. With who? With whom James. You’re supposed to be a writer. A guy that works with Regina. >It's been four days. >>And what? Did you think I was going to be alone forever? Is your ego that gigantic that you... I thought maybe for a week. You're completely oblivious to how out of line you are sometimes. You’re completely oblivious to how big of a- Hi Hayley, I’m so sorry I’m late. Hey Todd. Hey babe. I appreciate you coming all the way up from the city. James, this is Todd. Todd, this is James. Todd lives in Greenwich Village, right off of fifth avenue. Nice to meet you Jason. Can we get a couple of menus. You know the waiter? I come here a lot. How was work? It’s not work when you love what you do. >So true. >>Yes. We’ll take a couple of glasses of water Jason. No ice. But make sure it's cold. Ice machines in this city are filthy. Never have ice unless you make it yourself. Ice and lettuce. They never clean the lettuce either. It’s actually the number one cause of salmonella here in the city, more so than chicken if you can believe that. Ah for fucks sake. I thought you were off the drink? Do you have any more blow? What kind of stupid question is that? We have to go fix the ice machine babe. I’ll be right back. It’s so good. I stayed up till three AM every night for a week till I finished it. It’s eleven hundred pages but I couldn’t get enough. I’ll let you borrow it if you’d like? Here’s the deal. I enjoy reading, I mean I get it, but i went to Harvard. So... I sometimes think I’m a little too educated to really appreciate that kind of fiction. I mean clowns eating children, that sort of thing it’s, you know, no offense. Oh no, I understand. Of course. Can I get you something else? Todd was just telling me about his trip to Cambodia. The country. In Asia. Right. And we were talking about College. Ivy league, that sort of thing. A college degree. James wouldn't know much about that. More water maybe? Let me ask you something. It said on the menu that the eggs were free range. Yeah. My over seasoned omelette didn’t really taste all that organic. What does organic taste like exactly? Alright, alright. Maybe I’ll have to leave a little review later. Going back to my original question. Is there anything else? Non merci. Parlez-vouz Francais? No. Just the check. Here you go. Cash only. >Excuse me? >>We only take cash. That is a platinum credit card. I have a seventy thousand dollar limit on it. Swipe the card. It’s okay I have cash. Problem solved. I have an eight hundred and fifty two credit rating. Swipe the card. On what, my fucking hip? Keep the change. Thanks. You wanna go get a drink? Sure. And Regina is out of town so you should come check out my new digs after. I’d love to. And that new mattress I was telling you about. Dickheads. Who was that? No one specifically. She was pretty. I didn’t think so. I better get going too. How much do I owe you? Don’t worry about it. Thanks. Good luck with the writing. Have a drink Eileen, will yah? Why is it ya think that you always recon im lying to you? For example, when I say you need to stop drinking and get a job, You think i am just making that up? Look I appreciate the cocaine and I don’t want to come off as ungrateful, but you know what I mean? Hey i thought you were working? I quit. You boys will not believe the morning i had. Fucking teenagers man! Britney goes from not wanting anything to do with me, to all of a sudden insisting that I meet her father. Apparently, he knows me. What’s wrong with you two feckin’ clowns today? Nothing's wrong. Hayley stopped by. I don’t need any Hayley updates. She was in with some guy, making out the whole time. I think she knew I’d tell you. She was right. Your man was a bit of a dope. Todd. That’s it. He had his hands up her top. Hands down her jeans too at one point, I noticed. Will we take a shot? No. Just the one so. Eoin! Eoin, wake up to fuck, will ya! Whats wrong? We’re late. Alonzo’s gonna kill us. >What time is it? >>Twenty past twelve. Hello. Ok. What did he say? >He's outside. >>Outside where? Gentlemen! Next time you're late answering the phone i'll throw a grenade in the fucking window. Sorry about that Alonzo. I’m parked by the church so let’s make this quick. I imagine you two idiots are wondering what working for me entails? It crossed our minds alright. I work in sanitation. We specialize in taking out all the trash in the Bronx. No, fuck that. I fucking hate rats. A little different than what you’re thinking. We specialize in weasels, child fiddlers, drug dealers you know, that sort of thing. What do you want us to do? Diego “The Ego” Gonzalez. He got busted a year ago for forcing a fourteen year old to watch him jerk off. A fourteen year old boy called Sebastian. What's this have to do with us? Sebastian's parents paid me to take care of it. Again, what does this have to do with us? You work for me now so you’re gonna take care of it. >What do you want us to do to him? >>You're gonna whack him. >Whack him with what? >>With a bullet to the fucking head. We’re not the guys for that man. Well the best thing about working for me is that there’s no experience necessary. This is loaded and ready to go. There’s no way we’re killing anyone. You should have thought about that before you stole from me. Diego is a creature of habit. He orders the same pizza every day at the exact same time. You're going to show up five minutes before the delivery bow and blow his brains out. >Understood. >>We don't even know how to use a gun. It's easy. You see this? You pull it back a tad. This is absurd. You can't make us shoot someone. You're right. I can't. but I am going to have your entire family murdered if you don’t, so... ...your call. All the information will be sent to your flip phone. 4:52 sharp. Don't go for any long walks. We’re bolloxed. Stop drinking will you for fucks sake. I told you we should have called the cops. When did you fucking say that? It doesn’t matter when I said it, I said it, alright. What are we gonna do? We have to do it. We can't do it! You can’t even be seriously considering it. What else are we gonna do? I don’t know, but we can’t do that. You're right. We can't. We're gonna need balaclavas. How loud is this thing? I don’t know. You’re the one from Belfast, you tell me. What time is it? Three minutes. Alright, let’s just do this and be done with it. Good luck man. >What the fuck do you mean good luck? Where are you going? >>I’m the getaway driver. I have to stay with the car. >That’s bullshit. Why do you get to drive? >>Because you’re shitfaced drunk, Eoin. So I’m sober enough to go shoot this prick in the head, but I’m too drunk to drive? Stop it will yah, you’re like an aul wan complaining. For fucks sake! Don’t pull it down till you get to the door. Do I have to hold your hand for you as well? Fuck this! Oh my god. Ben and Carley broke up. That's like the craziest thing Iv'e ever heard. People break-up. Not Ben and Carly, okay they’re like soulmates. They’ve been dating since junior high. How do I look? Good. Like nine out of ten good. I’d give you a hard seven. That’s it? Maybe a soft eight. Fix your hair. Is that better? Better. Yeah, hair line is solid. You're going grey not bald. I told you that already. Do i look young or not? >Sure. >>How young? Thirty six. >I'm thirty five. >>Then thirty one. Whatever. Thirty six for fucks sake. Hey! I know you. No you don't. I’ve been working on my accent. Well, would you go away to fuck. Sounds good yeah. Listen I need you to, can you, can you take off? Are you working tonight? I quit, i told ya it was only temporary. Congrats! You know you never seemed truly.... ...truly, truly, happy there. You know? Look i'm kind of in the middle of something Ruby, i need you to go. Middle of what? Alright, your father’s gonna be repulsed by the sight of me. He’ll like you once he gets to know you. I’m nearly twice your age. He knew that already and he still wanted to meet you, so forget about it. Is your aul wan coming? My what? Your mother. You're from Connecticut. Is she coming, or not. Theydon't talk. She still thinks he's in jail. He was in jail? Yeah, he just got out. What for? I don’t know, maybe he... ....killed someone, or something. >He what? >>I'm kidding. So what was he doing in jail? He got three years for armed robbery. What did he rob? He held up some Mexican restaurant. but he’s changed now. Oh I have to take this. Hey bitch. Did you hear about Ben and Carley. Yeah I know. Mind officially blown. Yeah uppercase O.M.G. Hashtag dramaaa. Remember on her sweet sixteen when she was talking to Chris. Yeah, i heard they made out. By the way can I get a light? >What was that? >>Fuck. >I have to go. You have to go. >>Was that a gunshot? Hey. What the fuck? >What the fuck are you doing? >>What’s going on? >Get the hell out! >>Are you an undercover cop? I will fucking shoot you. >No you wont. >>I fucking will. Let's go. Let's fucking go. Let's fucking go! Why’s there a woman in the back seat? >She just randomly walked by? >>Are you taking the fucking piss?--- >She just got in. >>Hi. Can we fucking go?! You did say six thirty right. Yeah. Are you sure? Why do you always do that? Do what? >Second guess me. >>No i don't. Shut up, it's him. Hey daddy. Yeah we'er outside. Ok. What time? Declan has to work at eight. Where? Okay, I got it. Ok see you soon. Love you too Daddy. He's on the way. Check New York One again. I just did, there’s been nothing since. They’re gonna know it was us. You should have brought a different car. If someone saw us they would have come forward by now. We’re bolloxed man. We had already established that we were bolloxed. Ah fuck off with your fancy fucking words. So how did you two get into this situation exactly? The less you know the better. You shouldn’t even be here. No shit she shouldn’t be. Would you rather if I was a law abiding witness who reported you. We should have waited until dark to do it. Who shoots people in the afternoon? When its still fucking light out. He was a drug dealing paedophile. No one gives a shit about him. They’ll assume it was crime related. It's the bronx, people get shot all the time. So now what? Let’s stay out of Woodlawn for a couple of days. We’ll be grand here. What do you want to do about her? “Her” has a name. Alright, I'd better call him. Quit screaming! Is everything all... Everything alright? Yea it was grand. Eoin did it. Shot him right across the head. How many times did you shoot him Eoin? Once. Just the one time yeah. Where did you shoot him Eoin? The forehead. >Can you be more specific Eoin? Like what region? >>Here! Right above the right eye. So are we good now? How do you mean? Ok. What did he say? He has another job for us tomorrow. I’ll help. What kind of job? Robbing drug dealers or something. Oh, for fucks sakes. He's going to us fucking killed. Seriously, I’ve nothing going on tomorrow. I have an idea. An unconventional idea but I have an idea. Alonzo? Yeah, it's me again. What if I brought you a hundred grand cash first thing tomorrow? That on top of Diego would it get us off the hook? Cool. I’ll see you tomorrow morning so. The fuck are you gonna get a hundred grand? Frank. He’ll tell you to fuck off if you go round there looking for money. He keeps the Super Bowl money in the walk-in. We can’t rob Frank. Who’s Frank? Do you have any better ideas? He’s no one. You just got fired. When he goes around tomorrow morning and that money’s gone, he’ll know it was you. Not if we bust in while the place is still open. He’d never think it was us. And you know what he’s like. The whole of Woodlawn knows where he keeps that money. Plus Gerard is working. Gerard doesn’t give a fuck. He knows what we look like. We’ll wear the balaclavas. He knows what we sound like. I’m in. She’s in. The Feds are probably looking for me by now. There’s no danger I’m leaving this room tonight. There’s just no fucking way. Plus, I did enough damage for one day. Fine. >We'll take care of it. >>Fine. Fine. Can i borrow your gun though? For fucks sake. Someone's salty today. I’m not salty, I’m just confused. About what? You said your father wanted to meet me. >He does. >>So then where is he? He got held up. Daddy's always busy. Okay well I have to go so... For an old man, you’re a baby sometimes Declan. Would you just call him and see how long it's going to take. Hi Daddy. Declan has to leave shortly so. Okay, but I’ll wait. Ok, see you soon. He's going to be another hour. You know Timmy Thomas? Who's Timmy Thomas? This man standing next to you. That's Daddy. Daddy is Timmy Thomas? His name's Pa Joe.

I hate to be the one that stomps on your ego there Diego, but no one gives a fuck about you. No one cares that you’re dead. Stop it. Diego the Ego that’s what they called you. Why are you trying to hurt me? Does it make you feel like a man hurting me like that? Playing with my emotions by rejecting love. Smoking cigarettes, smoking crack. Diego, I cant go to jail. Look at me. I’m gorgeous. They’ll fucking fight day and night over me in there, so they will. You’re a sight to behold alright. Will you forgive me? Why would i do that? Because I’m not a bad person Diego. Says who? I'm a good guy. Why do you think that? You're not. You're an asshole. You don’t help others, you litter, you don’t recycle, not to mention... you fucked your best friends wife and you shot me in the goddamn head. We had a connection.
