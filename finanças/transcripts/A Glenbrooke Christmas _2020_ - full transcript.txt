RIP-FIXES-SYNC by VaVooM Absolutely, Tom. We'll be sending over the contracts for signature on Monday. Welcome to the Morgan Organization. Thanks. Hi. This is Jessica. I'm just confirming that Molly is coming to my grandfather's house to get me ready for tonight? Ok, great. - Thanks so much. - Bye. Hey Jerry, you got any of those holiday peppermints stashed away in there? Who do you think you're talking to? Merry Christmas. You're the greatest. I think this is the best gift I've ever received. Don't tell your grandpa that. He bought you an island to celebrate you taking over as CEO. Well, I'm not going unless I can bring these. You forgot your drawings. No, those are just doodles. It helps me focus when I'm on the calls. You can toss them. Hey. The place looks amazing. Really beautiful. Here, let me help. It's okay, Ms. Morgan. We can take care of it. How about just one? That way, when people compliment the decorations I can say I helped. Hi Martha. Jessica! How was Geneva? Productive. And cold, which you know I love. Is he back from the office yet? He's on his way. I'll let him know you're getting ready for the party, and Molly is upstairs waiting for you. Or you and I could switch places and I could decorate the Christmas cookies. Thanks, but I don't think I could fit into your gown. So this was really your childhood bedroom? From when I was six until I went to college. It's literally bigger than my apartment. Now, just picture it covered in Justin Timberlake posters and you've got my teen years in a nutshell. Is this you and your parents? Yeah. Where was it taken? It's so Christmassy and adorable. It's a little mountain town in Colorado called Glenbrooke. My mom lived there until she was six and it's where my parents met. So when was the last time you were there? Not since before they passed. I'm sorry. It's ok. I still had a wonderful childhood. I mean, my grandfather gave me everything I could have ever wanted. Including his real estate empire. Well, that's not official until January. But I'm ready. Yes, you are. Yeah, I'm not seeing any flames. Anything from inside the church? All clear inside. Copy that, Ruthie. I'll take a closer look. How's it looking, Chief? Well, I know where the smoke is coming from. The bell striker's motor burned out. It's a real old system. The electrician said it's gonna have to be replaced. Do you think they can do it by Christmas Eve? I sure hope so, otherwise there's gonna be a lot of very disappointed people around here. I've made a Christmas Eve wish on those bells every year of my life. You don't really believe in that, do you? All I know is last year I wished for a job in the department and here I am. You earned this position. Wishing had nothing to do with it. What did you wish for last year? A new pump for the truck. You were getting that anyway. Just secure the ladder, rookie. Fine. There she is. You look wonderful. Hi. I'd ask you how it went but I already know the answer. Did they already send you the deal memo? No, I just know that when you're involved it gets done. It gets done right. Your dad was the same way. I couldn't be more proud that you're on the same path he was on. You know, it's 30 years ago this week? I know. Come on. Let's get in there before someone grabs all the crab puffs. Ok. Alright. Come on. Merry Christmas. Thank you. Have we met? No, but give me 10 seconds. I'm Lucas. Jessica. Nine, ten. Nice to meet you, Jessica. Can I tell you how stunning you look tonight, or would that be moving too fast? Well, I think we should know each other for at least 30 seconds first. Good idea. 30. You look stunning tonight. Thank you. That was not 30 seconds. I may have counted by fives. - Cheers. - Cheers. What's going on? Annual tree lighting. I helped decorate. Really? I have a red eye back to New York. Listen, I know we barely know each other, but I would kick myself if I didn't ask you this. We have some acreage in Napa that'd be perfect for Morgan Enterprises to expand in the wine market. Could I email you a prospectus? Absolutely. Yeah? That's great. - Ok, I'll be in touch. - Ok. Great. It was so lovely meeting you. It was so nice to meet you. Alright. That's my favourite picture of your parents. My mom used to love to tell me the story of the first time Glenbrooke rang the bells on Christmas Eve. You know, I never actually heard how that tradition started. Really? It is the sweetest story. Okay, so there was a big blizzard coming and all of the children in town were worried that Santa wouldn't be able to find Glenbrooke because of the storm, so the church decided to ring the bells on Christmas Eve to guide Santa to town. And then every child in town made a wish that the storm would clear in time for Christmas Day, and that's exactly what happened. So, ever since then people thought that if you make a wish on Christmas Eve when the bells ring... Your wish will come true. Exactly. Well, it certainly worked for your mom. What do you mean? I remember your mom used to tell us, she and Tom were standing in front of the church on Christmas Eve a year after they met. The bells rang and she closed her eyes and she wished that she would marry Tom one day. And when she opened her eyes he was down on one knee. I never heard that story. No wonder they loved those bells so much. I thought it was just because Glenbrooke is where they met. I wonder if they were gonna tell me that part of the story the night that we were supposed to be there, but then they never got the chance. Oh, honey, I didn't mean to upset you. No, no. Martha, you didn't. I just... I've been thinking about going there for so long. Since I'm not taking over as CEO until January this might be my only chance. What a wonderful party. Thank you, Martha. As always, you've outdone yourself. Thank you. What's going on? Grandpa, I am thinking about taking a little trip before I take over as CEO. Sounds great. You want me to get the yacht in the Caymans ready for you? Actually, I'm thinking about going somewhere I haven't been in around 30 years. Glenbrooke. I'm not surprised. I've been online stalking my mom's childhood home for years. She really has. I'll bet, yeah. It's a... it's a rental now. The same people have owned it forever. It's available. I can actually stay in the house my mom grew up in. Well, that feels like a sign, doesn't it? It sure looks like one. It sure does. I think when I'm there I'll use my middle name and go by Jessica Emerson. That way I can just avoid the whole Morgan thing. Why would you wanna avoid that? 'Cause for once it might be nice to see if people like me for me and not for what I can do for them. I'll be back by Christmas Day. It feels important that I hear the bells and spend time in the place that my parents loved so much. Well, I'll make sure no one else is using the jet. Actually, I think I wanna drive. If I leave tomorrow morning I can be there by the next day. I'll bring my work with me, I won't miss a beat. But I will miss you. I'll miss you, too. But Christmas Day will be here before you know it. How about this one? That's my car. Trade you the Ferrari while I'm gone? She's all yours. Are you kidding me right now? I am so sorry! Are you ok? I'm... I'm fine. These guys, not so much. Here, let me help you. Did you not see me crossing? You came out of nowhere. I mean, I think you might have been a little distracted. Were you texting someone? I wasn't texting. It's fine. It happens all the time. Look, you weren't even in a cross walk. I was clearly crossing the road. You know what? Let me just pay you for the cookies, ok? It's fine. Just try to be more careful next time. After all, it's Christmas. I... sure. You have a Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. In 100 feet, turn left onto Daniels Lane. You have reached your destination. Mr. Mooney? Call my Wyatt. Nice to meet you. It's my pleasure. You must be Jessica Morgan. Actually, I'm going by Jessica Emerson while I'm here. Just for privacy. It's not a problem. Right this way. Thanks. Here's the cottage where you'll be staying. Your Christmas display is incredible. Well, you're welcome to decorate this house to your heart's content. There's lots of boxes with decorations and ornaments in the basement from when my folks lived here. Well, I don't think anything could top yours. You do all of it yourself? Yeah, for the past 50 odd years. Of course I'm not so fast anymore. Nowadays I have to start in August. Come on. Let me help you get settled. It's nothing fancy but... It's perfect. Well then before I leave you to it you should have this. What's this? It's a list of all Glenbrooke's events leading up to Christmas. It's why you're here, right? You know, I suppose it is. I should tell you, though, we're not sure what's gonna happen with the old town Christmas bells event Christmas Eve. Why not? It seems there's some issue with the system they use to strike the bells. Can't play the songs without it. Do you think they'll have it fixed in time for Christmas Eve? I sure hope so. It's been a tradition for almost 70 years. But don't you worry. I mean, even if you can't hear the bells there's plenty more to do around here. - Sure. - Yeah. If you need anything else just call me. I just got speed dial put on the phone, and if you need WiFi it's at Glenbrew Coffee right around the corner. Tell Shirley you're renting this house, she'll give you a little extra whipped cream on your cocoa. I'll do that. Thanks, Wyatt. Welcome to Glenbrooke. There. That wasn't so hard. What? No, no. No. Why? Stop. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Stop. Stop! Stop! It's just smoke! And I'm yelling at a smoke detector. Jessica? No. You didn't have to call the fire department. As soon as I hear the alarm I call the fire department. I mean, every second counts. Are you sure there's no fire? Positive. It just got really smoky after I added some wood. Let me guess. You were having another moment and you got distracted. No, I... it's not... Can't talk. Fire. It's not a fire, fire. Do you two know each other? We ran into each other earlier. See? Like I said, just smoke. I just had to make sure. Good. Now I can go have my dinner. Great display, by the way, Wyatt. It's probably the best one yet. LED lights. Who knew? Me. When I told you that if you switched to LED you'd stop burning out the transformer at the end of the street. Alright, alright, Mr. Know-it-all. Well, thanks. I didn't realize you were a firefighter. Fire Chief! Youngest in town history. He also volunteers at the library. And he loves children. And cats... Ruthie, do you mind? Not at all. Happy to help. Well, that's a very impressive resume. What's impressive is the amount of smoke you've built up. Was that your first time using a fireplace? What makes you say that? Well, for one, you forgot to open the flue. It's the opening inside the chimney. That lets the smoke out of the fireplace. Yes, I know what it is. I didn't realize it was closed. Ok, so next time you'll know. Is he always this serious? Yes, he is. Kind of a bummer. Ok, let's go. Thank you... I just realized I don't know your name. Kyle. Kyle Buchanan. Jessica... Emerson. Right. Yes. Well, between this and the cookie incident I hope your reign of terror is done for the night. Wait, Jessica caused the ginger-apocalypse? Is that what you called it? No, I... Yeah. Are we all clear? Yep, all clear. Better get the rig back before shift change. Right behind ya. I made you another fire, by the way. Thank you. Just doing my job. I thought your job was putting out fires. Right, yeah. Well, people think that that's all that we do but there's really a lot more to it. I know, I know. I'm just kidding around. I don't joke where my career is concerned. Good. Neither do I. What do you do? I... No, it's totally fine. I... it's none of my business. I'm sorry. I should get back inside. If you need anything... I'm sure Wyatt has you covered. Right. Yep. Have a good night. You too. You too. Hello? Jessica. Grandpa, hi. I just called to make sure you made it ok. Yes. I'm so sorry, I should have called. I'm just happy to hear your voice. I assume you saw the email from the London team? All they need is a little reassurance from you about the initial costs. Right. Yes. I will email them first thing in the morning. Say hi to everyone at the house for me? I will. Night, Jessie. Night. Hi. Come on in. Good morning. You're here bright and early. Wyatt told me you might be in here today. He did? It takes people a few days to detox. Well, I just have to get some work done this morning but then I will have the rest of the day free to... What? I just realized I have no plans and I can't remember the last time that happened. It's nice, isn't it? It's disconcerting. Nothing a little cocoa can't fix. Follow me. Another early bird. Must be something in the air. Morning, Shirley. Are you ok? You look stressed. I'm just trying to get the Christmas open house organized. It's a lot. Here. This one's on me. Thanks, Shirley. Your cocoa is ready. Thank you. Teri runs the arts centre down the street. Nice to meet you. I didn't realize Glenbrooke had an arts centre. Going on 10 years now. It's in the old school house. We have after school music and painting classes, a ceramic kiln, we even have a little gift shop slash book store. Stop by this afternoon. I'll show you around. I'd love that. Here you go. Thanks. I can't eat all this. Did you wanna share? Why not? I'm Jessica, by the way. Teri. Nice to meet you. Jessica's staying at Wyatt's rental place. Welcome. Did Wyatt blow his transformer yet? Not yet. No, but Jessica here did set off the smoke alarm. How... I always have my scanner on. You know, I still can't get used to how friendly everyone is around here. I'm always a little suspicious when people are nice for no reason. Where are you from? Los Angeles. Say no more. I thought you might need a replacement for the ones dropped yesterday. Wha-how-how did you know about that? When a beautiful woman catches the attention of our Kyle word gets around. I think you have the wrong idea. Do I? Yes. Ok. You get used to it. Can I help you take that? - Hi. - Hi. Thanks. That would be great. No problem. Little bit that way. There you go. Three, two, one, and... there you go. Thank you. My pleasure. You are just a magnet for mishaps, aren't you? Well, at least the screen didn't break. It's a Christmas miracle. I wish we had one up there. They still won't work? No. Apparently an engineering degree is no match for a 1956 Chime Pro. You have an engineering degree? MIT. Don't look so shocked. Sorry, I... I guess I was just wondering how you ended up as a Fire Chief in Glenbrooke. Well, I grew up here. I spent some time in Seattle after college doing the whole corporate thing but something never really felt right. I wonder how many people come to Glenbrooke and realize what they're actually missing. It happens all the time. Well, I gotta get back to the station. I'm actually headed that way myself. You are? I guess after you. Well, it certainly feels like we're gonna have another snow. I hope so. I can't think of anything I would like more than to be reading a book while it's snowing outside, all curled up by the fire. Don't say a word. No... I wasn't. I was gonna say if you're looking for a book store, there's one up around the corner. In the arts centre, right? That's right. That's actually where I was headed. I met Teri this morning at the coffee shop. Well, I'm actually heading this way but I hope you enjoy the rest of your stay. And snow, if it comes. Well, thank you very much for the escort. Bye. Hi. Are you the substitute art instructor? No, sorry. I'm... well coincidentally I do have an art history degree but I'm not your teacher. You found it. Hi. This place is wonderful. And it's filled with amazing students. They thought I was their teacher. Yeah, our usual teacher had to fly to Boston for a family emergency. So we're just waiting on the sub. The students were just getting ready to start on their final art piece this week before the Christmas break. Then it's gonna go into the gallery for the open house this weekend. If we can decide what to paint. The theme is "A Glenbrooke Christmas". And everyone will be painting the old town church bell. Yawn. Well, my favourite pieces are always the ones that show a little slice of life around the main subject, like little kids making their wish on the bells on Christmas Eve. But maybe one kid is looking up at his mom and you can see that's all he really needs. Are you sure you don't wanna teach these guys for the week? I'm sure your sub will be here any minute. Wyatt. Hi, let me help you. I can't let a guest do hard labour. I am happy to help. I can't let you do this all by yourself. What a wind last night. Here. One, two, three. I came over to ask you something. Did you live next door when the Franklins used to live here? Yeah, for a few years. Yeah. And then, when they moved, we bought the house for my parents to live in. Did you know them? Jennifer Franklin-Morgan, was my mother. Was? She passed. Almost 30 years ago now. I'm so sorry. But I'm so happy you found your way back. Would you like me to ask around, see if anyone remembers her from grade school? Perhaps you could connect with each other. Could we keep it between us, if you don't mind? You want your privacy. I remember. My lips are sealed. So, what are your plans for today? I think I'll get a Christmas tree. Yeah. Jessica. Ruthie. Hi. I didn't realize the fire department sold Christmas trees. Yeah, we do it to raise money for the arts centre. We make enough to give a few kids scholarships to the after school program. Well, that's a very worthy cause. I was just there yesterday. And I was waiting for you to say "I know, Shirley told me". I didn't wanna freak you out. Too late. Kyle's here, too. In case you were wondering. I was just getting a tree for the house. There's the perfect one in the VIP section. After you. I'll show ya. Great. And just to the left. Just make sure all the water is off so the pipes aren't going to freeze. - Hi. - Hi. Ruthie said this is the VIP section... People around here seem very invested in your love life. Yeah, that would be the only downside to living in a small town. When you get your heart stomped on everyone knows it. And then everyone wants to try to fix it. Bad break up? Sometimes you think you know someone and then you realize that they're not who they say they were. Shall we find you that perfect tree? Not too perfect, though, otherwise you won't know it's real. Right. Let's see. This is good. It is, isn't it? I meant the tree. Right. That's what I meant. Exactly what I meant. Why don't we get it packed up and delivered for you, huh? Great. Where's your car? I walked. I didn't wanna scratch the roof. It's my friend's car. You walked? Ok, well Ruthie promised you VIP treatment, that's exactly what you're gonna get. Just don't get used to it. I won't. So are you gonna put it on the fire engine? Can we do the siren? No, this is not a Christmas parade. I'm gonna carry it. Right. Of course. Siren would have been cool, though. Oh yeah, it's real cool. Are you gonna help me? No, I'll just watch you do it. Ok. You got a heavy one. Let's go. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. It's perfect. I can't wait to decorate it. You have ornaments? - Yes, I do. - Right here. Wyatt left me some. These are great. Vintage pieces. They don't make them like this anymore. You know, my parents had some just like this. Yeah? Where are they now, your parents? Well, my dad passed some years ago. I'm sorry. And my mom is actually on a Christmas cruise in the Bahamas with some of her Bunko friends. Good for her. How about your folks? Both passed away, actually. A long time ago. I'm sorry to hear that. I know the holidays can be tough. I mean, they're great, but also bittersweet. Like something's always missing. Exactly. I barely remember my Christmases with them. They died when I was so young. But I know they felt a lot like this. I feel really close to them here. Do you have any family in Los Angeles? I do, but Glenbrooke is special. Best town in the world. I mean that. The people here are incredible. When my dad passed, the entire town rallied around my mom and me, and even though I was living in Seattle at the time I realized I wanted to come home and serve my community. So I did. I moved back and I joined the fire department just like my dad had done before me. That's amazing. It feels really good to know you're following in a parents' footsteps, doesn't it? It does. Yeah. However, I can't say that my fiancée at the time was quite as enthused. She didn't like Glenbrooke? Let's just say living on a fireman's salary in a small town in Colorado wasn't exactly the life she wanted. Then she didn't love you for you. It shouldn't matter how much money you have. Yeah. I was upset about it at the time but then I realized it never would have worked out between us. We just came from completely different worlds. So if I were to tell you that I had millions of dollars, would that change how you felt about me? Well, first of all, I wouldn't believe you, you're far too normal. Well, I'll let you get to it. Do you wanna stay and help? If you're not on call, that is. Even if you're not on call you don't have to stay, I'd love to. Great. Here. Et voila. It's beautiful. Did you draw this? Yeah. You're really talented. Thanks. I'm sorry, I guess you didn't want me to see that. See what? Your art? No, that's ok. It's... it's... it's just a hobby. Well, shall we try the lights? Yes. Let's do it. Ok, let's see here. Three, two, one. There we go. What was that? That'd be likely the transformer. The one you thought Wyatt's lights would blow. Yep. Oh no. I guess I should... check on it. Yeah, yeah. Of course. I'm fine. I know where the flashlight is. Right. You've got a flashlight. And then I could call... call you later and let you know what happened. Or I could just call you. I would like that. Come in! Hey, Jessica. It's Wyatt. Hi. Kyle thought you might want some of these LEDs. Thank you. Hey, I'm just happy it's not my fault this time. Hi. Can I get one bag? - Hi. - Hi. Come on in. So how did it go with the art teacher? It didn't. She didn't show up. Oh no. What are you gonna do? I'm gonna have to supervise them myself. But then I have my Christmas carolling group rehearsing in the music room and the holiday open house this weekend to get ready for. I really need to get better at delegating. I know what you mean. I always wanna do everything myself. Ok, I'm gonna do it. Do what? Delegate. Watch this. Got any plans this afternoon? No. I did not mean to me. I'm not a teacher. Kids don't care about credentials. They just wanna be inspired. And you already did that once. Look. Dawn did this? It's her best work ever. Do you think she'd sell it to me? I would love to have this in my house. I think that would make her Christmas. So you'll do it? Absolutely, just let me know how much. I meant take over the class this week. I was talking about buying the painting. Sorry, you're already committed. You're good. Yeah. You know, I would love to help. Just keep in mind I have no idea where to start. It's the same as writing a book or making pottery or writing music. Just follow your heart. No, it's not possible, $10,000 is insane. Thanks. Are you sure? Kyle. Hi. Is everything ok? Not really. It turns out it's gonna cost $10,000 to fix the bells. Even if the town and the church split it, they just don't have the money. But they have to ring on Christmas Eve. Couldn't someone just go up there and... and ring them manually? No. There's not enough room for even two people up there. I'm trying to get a recorded version, but... It's just not the same. Not at all. Hey, Mr. Buchanan. Dawn, Billy. You guys are out early. Minimum day today. Hopefully we have a teacher for art class. You do. Really? I'm just helping out until Friday. Come on. Are you coming, Mrs... Jessica is fine. See you in there. Ok. I guess you... you're gonna have to go. Maybe I'll see you tonight? Wait, what's tonight? Tonight is the night where all the children come to Wyatt's house to meet Santa. There's gonna be a hot cocoa truck and a toy drive. You should come. Ok. See you later. Ok guys, so today we're going to decide what your final piece is gonna be for the Christmas in Glenbrooke open house gallery. And we're going to start with some music. Now, many of the great impressionists, including Monet, used music as a way to connect their minds to their hearts and then their hearts to the canvas. So I'm going to play some music and I would like you to draw what you hear. Ok, let's try this. Ok, go ahead. Draw whatever it makes you think of. - Hey. - Hey. Are you ok? Teri wants my work to be the main focus of the show. What if I can't think of anything else to paint? It'll come, you just gotta give it time. And patience. But everyone thinks of me as the artist here. It's my thing. What if all of a sudden I can't do it anymore? Don't force it. You'll find what inspires you. Thank you. Hi, grandpa. Hi. Mike in the accounting team just called. He said he emailed you for some details on the Goldstone project and you haven't written back. Well, I actually delegated that to Chelsea and her team so Mike can just get it from them. You did? I did. So, how's it been living in your mom's old house? And the town? Incredible. I can see why they wanted to come back here every year. But I might not even get to hear the bells. Why not? They're broken, and I guess it will cost a lot of money to fix them before Christmas Eve. Well, just write a cheque on the foundation. Happy to help. No. I mean, I want to help, just not like that. But you don't know these people. Any thoughts as to how you'll raise the money? Actually, I have an idea. I'm sure you do. Love you. Love you, too. Bye. Does she sound ok to you? She sounds reinvigorated. She does, doesn't she? Yes, she does. Alright. Come in! Hey, hey, hey. Hi. How are you? Great. Good, good, good. You? Good. Wait, is tonight an ugly sweater thing? What are you talking about? This is my nicest sweater. Kyle, I'm so sorry. I'm just kidding, it's hideous. That's just mean. I don't suppose you brought your own ugly sweater? I have one with ruffles that I kind of hate. Does that count? No. But... I brought you a selection carefully curated by none other than Ruthie, Teri, and Shirley. I have to pick one? Rules are rules. How about that one? You look... awful. Right back at ya. Shall we? Merry Christmas. And what do you want for Christmas? - Hi. - Merry Christmas. Good to see you. Keep warm, keep warm. Hey. You picked mine! It's my favourite. Can I let them in? Santa is ready. Alright. You can let them in now. Just head right on up. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Hi! Hey guys. Thank you. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas, darling. Merry Christmas. Do you like cocoa? Did someone say chocolate? Let's go. Ok. Can I ask you something? Yeah. Why does everyone keep asking you about the bells instead of the mayor or someone at the church? Well, when I was a kid I got lost in the woods a few miles outside of town and while everyone was out looking for me they decided to ring the bells and that's how I found my way home. After that, my dad volunteered to maintain them. He said you never know when someone might need to hear them. That's what I wanted to tell you, Kyle. I need to hear them. My parents were bringing me to Glenbrooke to hear the bells on Christmas Eve, and... well, we never got the chance. And now I'm here, 30 years later... I'll find a way. Actually, I had an idea. Teri? What if we changed the arts centre open house to a fundraiser? I wish we could, but the people in town have already made their holiday donations and they've already been so generous. Except we have a bunch of people just over that mountain in Brantley with money to burn and presents to buy. Yeah, but people in Brantley don't usually shop over here. We just need to make it seem like if they don't they're missing out on the next big thing. Trust me on this. You think we have enough art to sell? I think if everyone who takes a class at the centre just does one piece we'll have more than enough. I don't know. Even planning the open house was overwhelming. It's a lot of leg work but I can help. I'll... I can put out a blast on social media, we'll get people talking... We can do this. Ok. What do we have to lose? I'm in. I'll go tell the kids. Great. You know, I don't think anyone has made such a big difference around here in such a short amount of time. I see a problem, I wanna solve it. What happens if you can't? I don't know. It hasn't happened yet. I wanna share something with you. Ok. That's you. When I was nine, and those are my parents. You're mentioning your parents. You said that they wanted you to hear the bells on Christmas Eve but you never got the chance. So what happened? We went skiing for the day and on the way back, a deer ran in front of the car. My dad swerved to avoid it... I'm so sorry. Thanks. So I always thought about coming here on my own but there always seemed to be an excuse not to. But then when I found out my mom's childhood home was for rent I knew it was time. This was your mom's place? Yeah, until she was six. That explains why you fit in so well here. In a way this is your home, too. I wanted to tell you sooner, but I didn't think I would get close enough to anyone to talk about it. Well, I mean, I don't think either of us expected that. But thank you for telling me. I think that honesty is the most important thing in the world and I appreciate it. I know. And that's why I also wanna talk to you about my career. Hi. Hi, Teri. You guys, everyone is so excited about the fundraiser and the opportunity to show off how wonderful Glenbrooke is. What? We really should be careful. The last thing we want is for people to think that Glenbrooke is the next big thing. Before you know it, it's gonna become Brantley, too. What do you mean? Brantley was a lot like Glenbrooke, and then people moved in there, bringing millions of dollars, and then next thing you knew it was too expensive for regular people, like you and me, to live there. Money changes things and it certainly changes people. Not everyone with money is a bad person. No, but their priorities are different. And I know that first hand. I gotta head out. My carollers are about to sing. We'll be right there. Ok. I'm sorry, you were saying something about your career? Yeah... just that I'm so glad that I'm taking a break. So I can focus on the fundraiser. Me too. Sounds like they're starting, shall we? Is this ok? This is nice. Let's go. Ok guys, Christmas Eve is one week away and the fundraiser is in only three days. I have got an entire baking crew ready for this event. And I called everyone who's ever taken a class here and said all hands on deck. So we have local artists, potters, jewellery makers... everyone's gonna contribute something. We'll auction off rides in the fire truck and let someone be chief for a day. And all of the stores and restaurants on Main are donating a percentage of their profits on the day of the fundraiser. This is amazing! I've started getting the word out on social media through some people I know in Brantley. You know people in Brantley? Just friends of friends. I haven't forgotten about you guys. Do you all have your artwork? Great, now remember, it is completely up to you if you wanna sell these, they're your personal projects, it's totally your choice. Do we get a cut of the profits? Billy, it's for the greater good. What other greater good is there than taco money? I'm just kidding. We all wanna help. Alright, three days. Let's do this. Ok, you guys ready? Yeah! We're in! Go Glenbrooke! Here we go. You will need to tell him eventually. How did you find out? Did you think I'd let you teach a bunch of kids without at least doing a Google search? I was using my middle name as my last name. I didn't think it would matter. I mean, I didn't expect for any of this to happen. I came to Glenbrooke to connect with my parents, not to... to fall in love. But you did. I know. He's been through a lot, Jess. You just need to be up front with him. If I tell him the truth he won't see me the same way. I know it. And if you don't tell him he'll feel like he was betrayed again. You're right. You're right, I can't do that to him. I'm gonna tell him right after the fundraiser. What's going on? This is our yearly Christmas story time. We've had the same volunteer for years. Who? I'll give you one guess. Hello, everyone. My name is Kyle. Hi. And I'm gonna read you a story. But first I'm gonna need a very special helper to help me turn the pages while I read. Anyone? How about you? Ok. It's a lot of pressure, I know. Do you think you can handle it? I will do my best. Hi, my name is Jessica, and you can call me Jessie. Hi. Can I call you Jessie? We'll see. Ok. This is called "The Night Before Christmas" and it's my favourite Christmas story. I hope you like it as much as I do. The Night Before Christmas. "'Twas the night before Christmas and all through the house, "not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse. "The stockings were hung by the chimney with care, "in hopes that Saint Nicholas soon would be there." You know, once you sell one piece you will officially be a professional artist. It's gonna take more than selling a few paintings to afford college. There's always a way. And I will help you figure it out. But aren't you leaving after Christmas Eve? Well, I promised my grandfather I would be home for Christmas, but I can always come back. I don't know what you did but the phone's been ringing off the hook. People are asking what time they need to line up in the morning. Let's just say I know a few Shirleys in Brantley who helped me get the word out. People don't wanna be the odd one out. I really think it might work. I think so, too. And Kyle's already been in touch with the guy in Denver who has the motor for the bell tower. He's planning to come up the day of Christmas Eve. If we get the money together. We will. Well, I'm gonna go down to the station to cover a shift. I'll see you later? Yeah. See you tonight. What's tonight? Kyle just invited me to dinner at the station after his shift. That sounds romantic. Well, I'm pretty sure "romantic" and "fire station" have never been used in the same sentence. Jessica, I like you a lot. But Kyle and I have been friends for almost my entire life and I don't wanna see him get hurt again. Teri... I know, I know. You'll tell him after the fundraiser. I just hope it's not too late. Hi. Hi. Are you ready? Aren't we eating here? To use a real estate term, let's call it fire station adjacent. You did all this? Well, you could say I had a little bit of help. This is beautiful. You did not have to do anything fancy. I know. Which is why I did this for the main course. Ta-dah. Excellent choice. And... This. Voila. Well, now it's perfect. It's ok, I don't need a glass. Ok. I do. I'm really bad at toasts. I have one that always works. It's a little long though, so bear with me. Clink. - That's it? - That's it. Well said. I rehearsed it on the way over. Well, clink to you, too. I'm stuffed. Well, that's too bad. Why? Because I asked Shirley what your favourite dessert is. You didn't. Oh, my goodness. This... I feel like I hit the jackpot. It's that good? It's very good. - Clink. - Clink. Well, thank you for tonight. Christmas Tree Lot is my new favourite restaurant. Well, be sure to leave a positive review online. Of course. Well, I guess I'll see you in the morning then. I have the whole day off to help. I'm really glad you're gonna be there. I wouldn't wanna be anywhere else. Me neither. And afterwards I really wanna talk to you. I know. You do? Of course. It's the elephant in the room. We need to talk about us and what happens between us after Christmas Eve. We do. It'll be ok. Hope so. But right now we should probably get some sleep. We have a really big day tomorrow. Goodnight. Goodnight. Jessica, it's Wyatt! Hi. Come on in. I just wanted to say thank you for all you're doing with the bells. And to give you this. What is it? It was left behind by your mom and her folks. I'm so sorry, I forgot I had it all these years. It's beautiful. Thank you. I'm just happy it's back where it belongs. Anyway, I'll see you in the centre tomorrow. I'm helping Shirley sling cookies. I'll see you tomorrow. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. Jessica Morgan? Bridget! Hi. I had no idea you were up here for Christmas. Yeah. Are you here for the art sale? Because I hear there's some major undiscovered talents around here, and it's for such a good cause. That's... that's what I hear, too. Well, I'm glad I got here early so that you don't buy everything before everybody else gets a chance. So good seeing you. We'll have to catch up. So who was that outside? I'm going to talk to Kyle tonight after the sale. I'm glad. And I hope you decide to stay for Christmas Day. Wyatt has this big pot luck, everyone goes. That sounds wonderful. It's just that I told my grandfather I'd be home. Then maybe you'll come back? I would love to. But... You'll find a way. You're a problem solver, remember? Okay, today is the day. Let's go. So good... I'm just going to go get... Thanks. Ready? Yeah. Ok. It's right there. Ok, everyone. Here we go. It seemed great. How do you think we did? We did it! We did it? We really did it. We did it! Amazing! I'm gonna call the bell guy in Denver and tell him we're a go. Ok. I'll be right there and then we can talk. - Ok. - Ok. Thank you so, so much! I knew it! Wyatt! I'm so happy. Thank you. Hey. Everything ok? Is it too late? They can't fix the bells in time? No, he's... he's coming. He'll be here first thing in the morning. Ok, then what's wrong? Well, my friend from Glenbrooke PD texted me. I asked him to do a little research after you told me about your family. I thought maybe I could find some photos of them for you, and I guess he dug a little deeper. Kyle, I wanted to tell you sooner... But you didn't. I don't even know who you really are. I'm the same person I was five minutes ago. No, you're not. You're Jessica Morgan and that changes everything. Ok, see? This is why I waited to tell you. Because I knew this is how you would react. I knew you would see me differently. Of course I see you differently. But not because of your money. I don't care about that. Ok, then why? Because you didn't give me the chance to prove to you that it didn't matter. You made the decision for me. Here I am, blindsided again. Fool me twice, right? So when was I supposed to tell you? Was it after your speech about how money changes people for the worse? Or was it after you said that love can't work between people from two different worlds? I knew that once I told you this is what would happen and... I just didn't want it to end. This isn't your real life, Jessica. This is. It would have ended, anyway. We don't know that. What if we could have made it work? Yeah, maybe. But I guess now we'll never find out. Are you sure you won't stay for the bell ringing? It's only happening because of you. And isn't that what you're here for? I came here to connect with my parents. With the love they had for each other and for this town, and I felt it. All of it. But now when those bells ring all it will remind me of is what I almost had. And what I've lost. From what I hear you're not the type to walk away from the table. I am when there isn't anyone on the other side. One last cocoa. For the road. Thank you. We're really gonna miss you. I'm gonna miss you. Glenbrooke won't be the same without you. I was here for such a short time. Long enough to make a difference in a lot of people's lives. What's this? It's from an art school in Vermont. Someone sent them photos of my work and they wanna offer me a scholarship to their Rising Star summer program. Dawn, this is wonderful. Congratulations. Thank you. For you. Thank you. Right, yeah. I know. Jessica left this in the house. Look at all these. She's really good. It's you, Wyatt. Awe. That's her and Kyle. I... I have to show these to Kyle. Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. Kyle. Ruthie, what are you doing here? Why do you have that? Well, inside is a little collection of art I like to call... "Kyle's an idiot". She was your soul mate and you just let her go. She sure did capture everything with these. Just to refresh your memory, that's the same woman you just let drive away. It would have never worked out between us, Ruthie. We just come from completely different lives. There's more to it than what you know. Really? Yes. Like? Like she's about to become CEO of a massive corporation. And your point? My point is, how could she live here and still do her job? You know why, don't you? Because you didn't give her a chance. I did to her what I accused her of doing to me. I am an idiot. Yeah. You are. Can you cover my shift? Of course. Go get her! Thank you for calling Harold Morgan. I can't come to the phone right now. What am I gonna do? Hey. What are you doing here? I was driving to Los Angeles. Why? Because you left something behind. My sketch book? No. Me. I never should have pushed you away like that, Jessica. I did everything you feared the most. And that wasn't fair. I should have been more understanding. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I know what you went through before and I wish I had just been honest from the beginning. I was selfish. Honestly, I was just so happy that I didn't want it to end. Well, it doesn't have to. Even though we're from different worlds? Different, yes. But... forever connected. What do you mean? You were meant to come to Glenbrooke. And you and I were meant to meet each other. They've cleared the road up ahead. I guess the only question is... which direction are you gonna go? Whichever one leads back to you. Ok. That was a great answer. I wish I knew where my grandfather was. Still can't get a hold of him? No. It's like his phone is off. That's because I was in the air. - Grandpa! - Ta-dah! What are you doing here? Well, I didn't wanna spend Christmas without you, and I wanted to see the place that made you so happy. But how did you know I was coming back here and not driving to L.A.? Some lady named Shirley called me? Ok. Grandpa, this is Kyle Buchanan. Kyle, my grandfather, Harold Morgan. It is a real pleasure to meet you, Mr. Morgan. Call me Harold. Now that's why I came. I wanted to see that smile that I heard in your voice. It's not that I'm unhappy in L.A., I do want you to know that. It's just... I didn't know what I was missing until I came here. And I know, I should have been more focused on the business, that's my future, it's your legacy, my dad's legacy. I owe it to you both to see it through. Stop right there. You don't owe me a thing, Jessica Morgan. Except your happiness. And it seems to me you have that in Glenbrooke. I do. But... What do you wanna do, Jessie? It's ok, just be honest. Ok. I will. I still want to run the company. Which you can do anywhere, really, as long as you have WiFi. I can. And I wanna manage our family's charitable foundation and make our focus the arts. Like your mom did. What? Well, that's what she did in the company. She always wanted to help people, just like you. So I'm actually following in both my parent's footsteps? I can't think of a more fitting legacy. Neither can I. It's so cold, isn't it? Can we... can I take her for a second? Of course. I'm sorry. Go ahead. Just come here. I have something for you. What's this? Well... I get to do it? We wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you. And my parents, and your dad. I am exactly where I'm supposed to be. Do you remember I told you I got lost and the bells brought me home? I was starting to feel lost again, but this time the bells didn't bring me home. They brought me to you. It's time! Shall we? Ok. Make a wish. I'm good. RIP-FIXES-SYNC by VaVooM
