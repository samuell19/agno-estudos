(dramatic music) (thudding) - [Detective] Jesus. God damn machine! I hate this thing. It never works. (interposing voices shouting) - Maybe you just ticked it off. Bangin' on it like that. I'd get upset, wouldn't you? Thank you. - [Detective] Ah, here we go. Beginning suspect interrogation, date June 21st, 2028. Time, 6:23am. Investigation of multiple homicide. Please state your name and occupation. - Garland, Dr. Garland Widmark. Computer programmer. - Where do you work? - The Titanic. - Excuse me? - (laughs) It's just a joke, a bad joke. - [Detective] Makin' wise cracks, Doc? You see somethin' funny about this situation? - No, no I don't. - [Detective] We all sympathize with your ordeal, Dr. Widmark, but if you just sort of... - I just never saw anybody die before. Not one single human being. I, I feel like I've been in a war. That's what it was, you know, it was a war. - [Detective] Well, perhaps if you tell us about it you'd feel better. - Yeah, right. Um, I just really don't know where to start, though. - [Detective] Try at the beginning. (dramatic music) - [Garland] The first thing I remember about last night is Lita and me running for our lives and a couple heavy hitters right on our heels. (panting) We almost escaped when suddenly a car blocked our way. (brakes screech) There was no way out. The situation seemed hopeless. Exactly like it was supposed to. - Well, well, well. You and your skirt musta gone simple, gumshoe. Sneakin' around on Rains tur-tur-tur-tur-tur-tur-turf. - Yeah, you musta gone simple. (cackles) - I just said that. - I know. - Then why did you repeat repe-repe-repe-repeat it? - I wanted to make sure they, they, they got it. - Don't worry, they got it. Now, they're gonna get it. (suspenseful music) Kiss your boyfriend goodnight, sweetheart. (gangsters laughing) - It's late. (whacking) - Ah, you're dead, girly girl. (whacking) (grunting) - That's Dr. Girly Girl to you. (indistinct shouting) (buzzing) What'dya have to go and do that for, Garland? Just when a girl's startin' to have some fun. - We're on a deadline, Lita. It's already five to 10:00. - Would you unwind? You don't have to be back until midnight. What's wrong with mixing business with pleasure? - The pleasure's more like aggravation. This old program's riddled with glitches. Didn't that stutter bother you at all? - No, I thought it was kinda cute. - Uh-huh, well, enjoy it while you can because when I put the new Donald 3000 online, you're gonna find that these RCUs will talk like they've been given voice lessons from Henry Higgins. - Mm-hm, assuming the stutter's a computer error. - Mechanical glitches are your department, Dr. Hayworth. - That's right. Think about it. - What, you're not gonna fix it? - Nope, I like cute things. - Me too. - What? - Nothing. Lita and I were chief technicians at the most popular theme park in history, Gangster World. I never enjoyed going on test runs much, but when Lita asked me, well, what could I say? I really liked her. I mean, everyone agreed the park's creator, Dr. Greenstreet, was a genius. Since the first Gangster World opened, crimes dropped 50%. - Welcome to Gangster World. Choose from any of our 50 game areas like Burnt Out Alley, Speakeasy, and Red Light District. Remember, you are safe at all times. Crime, violence, cruelty, don't you just love it? Well, now you can live it. Here at Gangster World, you're free to express your darkest desires. Your tracker mechanism cancels play at any time, so keep your tracker with you always. So have fun, don't pull any punches, and kill one for me. Remember, you are safe at all times. Our Robotic Carbon Units are-- - So what do you feel like tonight? Chinese or Italian? - Enjoy. - [Garland] So here's how the park worked. Robotic Carbon Units, RCUs for short, inhabited the park's 50 game areas and snapped to life the moment a player stepped into the action. Players paid top dollar for the pleasure of abusing the RCUs. Rape, mutilation, you name it. If you could think it, you could do it at Gangster World. And if they got too rough, all the players have to do is hit their trackers and the RCUs would freeze. (mysterious music) (keys clacking) (beeping) At the heart of it all was the park's mainframe computer, the Donald 2000. The action was monitored by Dr. Claire Arden and our lovable chief of security, Alan Houston. In plain talk, Houston hated my guts. That night was a big night. We were scheduled to go online with the new breakthrough fail safe Donald 3000 system. My job was to initiate the power transfer and upgrade at the stroke of midnight. Greenstreet was a little skittish. I had some big shot investors in for a demo of the new system and was worried about attempted sabotage from our competitor, Cybertronics. The place was crawling with security. Most of these guys were rough pieces of work who enjoyed their job just a little too much. - What are you gawkin' at, boy? That's one of the perks. Go on, cop a feel. - No, thank you. - (scoffs) Candy ass. (banging) All right, scumbag, let's go. You too, sweet cakes. Come on. (whacking) (laughs) (soft suspenseful music) Okay, strip 'em. (keys clacking) - [Automated Voice] Welcome to the Donald 2000 main menu. Please select command. Upgrade, repair, liquidation, assembly. Liquidation selected. - [Garland] The liquidation room was where we recycled faulty or worn out RCUs, the part of the process I hated. - [Automated Voice] Please place RCU on the disassembly unit. - Okay, honey, come on. - [Garland] I don't know why it got to me so bad. After all, RCUs were only 49.9% human and 50.1% machine, right? (machine humming) Still, I didn't have much of a stomach for it. (machine beeps) (bubbles gurgle) (laughing) (sizzling) - You smoke now, bitch. (coughing) Come on up. You see the look on the kid's face? Greener than an Irishman on St. Patty. Top of the mornin' to ya, laddy. (laughs) - That's real funny, Mason. - Oh relax, bud. Wait'll you do this two, three times a week. You get used to it fast. - [Garland] What happened from this point on I can only guess, and it's so bizarre you probably won't believe me. Basically whenever we need a new robot for a game, we simply go down to the liquidation room, select a recycled skeleton and program it with a new personality and characteristics. All this is normally done under my strict supervision. - [Automated Voice] Welcome to the Donald 2000 Main Menu. Please select command. Upgrade, repair, liquidation, assembly. Assembly selected. (machine humming) - [Garland] What happened that night went unnoticed by everyone until it was too late. (suspenseful music) - [Automated Voice] Downloading. Thou shalt obey every guest's wish. Thou shalt be true to your program. Thou shalt not kill. Access database. Selecting profile. Profile selected. Downloading personality profile. (buzzing) (electric humming) (dramatic music) - Too bad we had to steam that one. She was a keeper. - Mm-hm. (electric buzzing) (thumping) Hey guys, I think there's somebody in there. (banging) (grunting) (dramatic music) What the hell? Do somethin'! (whacking) (grunting) (guard shrieks) - Are you Garland Widmark? - No. - [Automated Voice] Update file. Thou shalt kill. (cracking) (guard groaning) (guard thuds) (suspenseful music) (door rattles) - [Garland] Houston had controls in full force as a countermeasure against sabotage from the outside, but what these guys were about to discover was that the saboteur was already on the inside. (thwacking) (grunting) - Hey. (intense music) (thudding) (groaning) (guard thuds) - Of course I had no idea that this guy was after me. I mean, why would anybody wanna kill me? I didn't have an enemy in the world. Lita actually defines or used to define my character as rah-rah, which stands for revoltingly agreeable squared. I had some time to kill until midnight. Lita, as always, was in the mood for fun. And like a good little rah-rah, I gave in to her. All right. (beeping) Claire, come in. I need to run a check on the villains. Can you give me access to the Speakeasy? - There's already a game in progress, Garland. - How many players? - Um, just two. - Will you let them know we'll be joining them? - Okay, but you're gonna miss the big party. - [Garland] That's okay. - Let the games begin, people. Your leader has arrived. Ah, there he is, my boy wonder. How goes the test run, Garland? - Revoltingly violent, Dr. Greenstreet. - Ooh, love those words. - I'll have the Donald 3000 up and running by the magic hour. - Claire. Houston. A toast to tomorrow. - To all 80 new Gangster Worlds around the globe. - To the single mainframe uniting them all. Houston, remember 20 years ago I saw the future, a franchise of therapeutic theme parks where people could safely release their tensions and rejoin society as model citizens. And now with the new Donald 3000 at the helm, we can upgrade security and performance levels throughout the park. (lively music) (chattering) - [Garland] The Speakeasy was our hottest attraction. The guests loved to mix it up with the motley grew of gangsters and their dames. Lorre was the arch fiend of Gangster World and his main squeeze was femme fatale by the name of Astor. - Lorre, I'm gettin' ants in my pants. Come on, take me out for a twirl. - You're detrailing my train of thought. Go, amuse yourself. - That's what you always say. I'm tired of playing along. - Astor! Let me be. - [Garland] Lorre's main territorial rival was a bootlegger named Rains, a quick-tempered thug with a passion for poker. He liked cards. - Cheater, you callin' me a cheater? (laughs) He's callin' me a cheater. I'm gonna give you five seconds to apologize. One, (knife snaps) two, three, four, five. (man grunts) - Perfect audio calibration, great visual synthesis, and look, Garland, there's even some fun going on. - [Garland] Players wore period costumes to enhance the experience, but you could always pick 'em out in a crowd. - (laughing) Hey. Hey! - [Garland] They'd be all over the pleasure model RCUs like a bad suit. (lively music) (soft suspenseful music) (door creaks open) - Hey, let's, uh, smash some skulls. (laughing) Yeah? - Hey. Give me a swig of that. That one's yours. - Uh-huh. (thwacking) (grunting) (players laughing) (crashing) - [Player] Boy, you're a bleeder, aren't you? This is great! (players laughing) (shouting) (whacking) - [Player] How'd that feel? You like that, huh? (grunting) (whacking) - What have we got here, huh? - Who's nature boy? - Are you Garland Widmark? - You're next, pal. (whacking) (grunting) (player screams) (dramatic music) (thudding) (lively music) - Thank you. - Thank you. - So you guys work here, huh? - Why, you got any, uh, comments? - Well, I think the chicks need a little more flexibility in their hips. I'm afraid I might wear 'em out. (laughing) (ominous music) - Cigars? Cigarettes? Wubba wubba? - [Players] Wubba wubba! - One please. - Wubba wubba, wubba wubba. Wubba wubba. (ominous music) (lively music) (guests chattering) - Hi there, handsome. I thought I'd already t-t-tangled with all the hot action in town. I'm Astor. What's your momma call you? Ooh, the strong, silent type, huh? I like that. So, you wanna buy me a drink or shall we skip the foreplay? - Lita. Lita. Lita had no idea how I felt about her. She didn't notice rah-rahs like me. She was a sucker for good looks and confidence. - Mm, outstanding anatomical proportions. You're good. Hey, smokin', how's about we play a little Jack and Jill? - He's mine, squirt. Back off, or after I finish cuttin' you down to size you're gonna need tweezers to pick up the pieces. - Oh, I'm sorry, didn't you see the sign? No cows on the dance floor. (whacking) (screaming) (glass shattering) (thudding) (grunting) (glass shattering) (man thuds) (ominous music) - Whoa! - Whoa! - Nice threads, bozo. Fit to be buried in. (man thuds) (glass shatters) (buzzing) (Garland shrieks) (chair crashing) (thwacking) - Hayworth! Let's go! - Garland! Garland! Whoa! - Come on, let's go, let's go. (glass shattering) - Look out! (screams) (crashing) (shattering) (man shrieks) (crashing) That was awesome! (laughing) - Awesome? That guy. The, the fail safe didn't work. I mean, this just one... (coughing) - Come on, you big you big lug. He's no fun. I'm the one that likes the action. (clanking) Whoa! (Lita screams) - Lita! - Put me down! Whoa whoa! - Lita! (thudding) Ooh, no. - Freeze! (buzzing) Freeze! (dramatic music) (whacking) (shrieking) (thudding) - Grab the girl. - Hey, what are you doing? Let me go. What are you, let go! (whacking) - Oh no, Lita! (man shrieks) (cracking) Lita! Lita, where are you? - [Claire] Garland, what's wrong, what's the matter? Are you okay? - Lita, Lita, have you seen Lita? Have you seen her? - No, the last time I saw her she was with you. - No, no, no, we, we got split up in the park. A big guy, he attacked us. - What's goin' on? - She's in there. She's in there, I gotta find her. I gotta find Lita. She's in there, I know she's in. She's in there, she's in there. - According to the personnel report, Dr. Hayworth just left the park. - No, no, no, no, that, that can't be right. There was an outsider in the game. - An outsider? - Yes, he attacked us. - Sure, guess that's easier than admitting that your almighty computer has gone screwy. - Computers are not like people, Houston. They don't make mistakes. - Now this outsider, he could be the saboteur. I just saw him beat the sunshine outta all your storm troopers. - Oh, dream on, kid. My boys can handle anything. Unlike your computer, they don't g-g-glitch. - Okay you guys, let me go, all right? Just put me down. I've gotta get back to work. Please, come on. - Come on. Where are you, Lita? - Scanning all levels for employee ID Hayworth, 257797 Bravo. - [Man On Walkie Talkie] Moonwalker report. Moonwalker, do you copy, over. (screaming) (buzzing) (man shrieks) (buzzing) - Come on, come on. Hold it, hold it. - Hold it! (thwacking) (screaming) - [Guard] We've got a code red. Repeat, code red. (alarm blaring) - [Guard] Man down, man down, sector 19 level three. Code red. (suspenseful music) - Houston. - What? - You better get down here, sub level two, liquidation. - What is it? - None of your business. - Damn it, Houston, tell me what it is! - Shut up! And if you're still blabbering when I get back here, I'm gonna divorce your tongue from your mouth. (suspenseful music) - [Automated Voice] System failure. - [Garland] All hell was breaking loose throughout the park. RCUs out of control, the outsider on the prowl. - Well, ginch, I got some ba-ba-ba-ba-bad news, and some real bad news. Bad news is, the Kingpin's awfully disappointed. This Garland kid's still suckin' air. You failed your mission, pallie. The real bad news is the Kingpin can't afford to have anybody snoopin' around, and that means you. Nothin' personal, it's just business. (whacking) (grunting) (beeping) - The violence levels are skyrocketing. - Somebody tell me what the hell is going on. Who triggered the alarm? It's like a mad house out there. Garland? (thwacking) (grunting) - Hey, what's goin' on? - Hey, hold it right there. - You! - Get him! - We've got two stiffs in the basement that look like they picked a fight with King Kong. - Dead people, real dead people? That's impossible. - Oh yeah? Check it out yourself. I still got pieces of them under my shoes. - No, Gangster World was designed to reduce violence in society. People are suppose to take out their anger and frustrations on the RCUs, not on each other. That's impossible. How could this happen? - Um, sir, Garland thinks that there's an outsider in the park. - An infiltrator? Yes. - I suppose that it could be our competitors at Cybertronics. - Of course, who else? Our ads have been trumpeting the Donald 3000 for weeks. They know we're about to become invincible. They're trying to stop us. Houston, get out there and find that saboteur. - Yes sir. - What about the guests? - What about 'em? - They're in danger. Shouldn't we evacuate the park? - Right, yes, yes. Tell 'em we're shutting down for the upgrade and offer them 500 credits. Hold on, make it 400. No wait, 250, that should do it. - Well, I'm goin' with ya. - The hell you are. - Lita's in there. - Look, I thought we covered this. Dr. Hayworth went home. - Garland, sit down. And turn off that alarm. I'll take care of damage control. - [Garland] The security teams were deployed throughout the park. Lucky thing, or at least so I thought at the time. - [Guard] Level six clear. (dramatic music) (whacking) (glass shattering) Cross forward position. (buzzing) 15 clear. (shouting) (thumping) (mumbles) Moving into the Speakeasy, and we are clear. - [Garland] Evacuation of the guests was the immediate business at hand. - Hey, what happened? Turn it back on. - [Guest] Look, I paid money to have-- - He was just about to show me the torture of 1,000 licks. - [Garland] For most, this was a thrill ride they'd saved for a whole year to enjoy, and didn't wanna call it a night. (guests chattering) And evacuation or no evacuation, the big order of the day was find the saboteur. - Okay, people, pop quiz. The functions and memory banks of the Donald 3000 have been loaded into the system. Claire, for 10 points, what happens at midnight? - Um, we've arranged for a power surge to start up the new software. - Correct. Garland, your turn. What happens if we're not ready when the power surge hits? - The system fries. - That's right, the system fries. And the whole place goes up like a match box. Now listen here, boy wonder, you're gonna plant your fanny in that chair for the next 90 minutes and then you're gonna bring the new Donald 3000 online and that's all she wrote. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go babysit our investors. They didn't pay all that money just to see a fireworks display, now did they? I don't want anymore foul ups, people. (suspenseful music) - Garland, Dr. Greenstreet just said for you to-- - Claire, I think somebody slipped Donald the virus. - What? - I'm just gonna go in there and I'm gonna check on the bipolar chip, okay? I'm just makin' a house call. - [Guard] Be advised, saboteur is armed and dangerous. - [Garland] The outsider found himself hunted by both the guards and the RCUs. The tables had turned. Now the stalker was being stalked. - [Guard] Blue team is on point, red is rolling. - [Guard] Level six clear. (guards chattering drowned out by music) - I tried to call Lita at home. She wasn't there. I wanna run a diagnostic on the bipolar chip. Maybe it's been effected by the power fluctuations. Hold your breath. All over Gangster World the RCUs were running wild. It was almost as if they were conspiring, as if they had their own private plans. Maybe the saboteur had slipped the computer a virus somehow. I was looking for the malfunction when something shocking happened. - Garland. - What? - [Claire] The violence levels are dropping. - Lita! - What? - Lita, she's in the Speakeasy. Two of Lorre's men got her. - What? - Look! - Garland, I don't see anything. - Look, she's in there. You've gotta believe me. - Garland, Houston said she went home. - Look, I don't give a darn what Houston said. The violence levels are down. I'm goin' in. - No, no, Garland. - Look, if the outsider sabotaged the computer then it could've affected the other systems including the employee roster, right? Right. Once all the guests were out, Houston and the storm troopers went wild. Pretending to hunt for the saboteur, they began shooting any RCU that wouldn't freeze, not realizing the real danger they were in. - Oh look. (gun firing) (man thuds) - Outstanding, sir. - Oh, there's one for you. (gun firing) - [Houston] Well done. - Sir, that one's got your name written all over it. - This place is lousy with saboteurs. (gun firing) I'm beginning to appreciate the-- - Allure? - Allure of this place. (laughing) (dramatic music) - Crime. Violence. Cruelty. - I gathered my nerve and I crept back into the park. The outsider could attack from anywhere. I didn't think I could get more frightened until I saw the bodies of the dead guards. I'd never seen a corpse before. There'd be no repairs for these guys. Lita! And then I remembered Lita, alone and in danger. I had to find her, I had to. Lita! Lita! I worked on you. Lita? (soft mysterious music) Lita? (robot humming) (beeping) - [Automated Voice] Thou shalt obey every guest's wish. Thou shalt be true to your program. Thou shalt kill. (ominous music) - What's goin' on? No, no, please just put the knife down, okay? Come on. No, no, I programmed you. What's goin' on? I... Listen, there definitely must be something wrong with the program. - Butch, Petey, grab him. - What? (thwacking) (woman shrieks) (whacking) (dramatic music) - You wouldn't hit a girl, would you? Yah! (woman thuds) - Please don't hurt me. - Come here. Stop shaking. - Okay. Okay. Okay. - You're breathing because I decided to let you and I might change my mind, capiche? Now, why would someone want to kill you? - Someone wants to kill me? - Yes, I do. - Why? - Because a guy named Kingpin paid me to. - Who's Kingpin? - I am asking the questions here. Now, who is he? - Wait, aren't you some kind of saboteur? - Just give me a simple answer. Who is this K-K-K-Kingpin. - Oh my God, are you an RCU? - Don't get goofy on me, punk. Now, who is he? - I told you, I don't know. - Then I don't need you. Nothing personal, it's a hard, cruel world. - Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. It must be Lorre, he's the main crime boss in the town. - Lorre? - Yeah, yeah sure, it makes perfect sense. You see, he, his men kidnapped Lita so they must be the ones trying to kill the both of us. - All right, if we're gonna rub out Lorre we better make like the shadow now. - After I find Lita. She must be scared to death. (footsteps clanking) (suspenseful music) - You are dead, history, smoke, venito, iced, kaput, hasta la vista, curtains, sayonara, bye bye. Are you listening to me? I am talking to you. - Me and the outsider were not temporary allies. I had to find the mysterious Kingpin to save Lita. He had to find Kingpin to survive. Lorre was top dog in our RCU pound. He had to be Kingpin. He had to be. All right, who are you? Huh? How'd you get into the game? All right, if you're not a saboteur then why are all the park systems falling apart? - Less talk, more walking. - [Garland] Could the outsider be an RCU? He had to the telltale stutter but I needed hard evidence, so I did what any scientist would do. (thwacking) (Garland groans) - Explain before I rub your teeth into the sidewalk. - You're an RCU. - What's an RCU? - A Robotic Carbon Unit. Ow. - What's a Robotic Carbon Unit? - A machine, a robot, what you are. - You're not? - No, I'm human, see? - What's the difference? - Look, look! That's the difference. - So, it takes all kinds. - [Garland] My hunch was right, he was an RCU. But that meant someone had to program him. Not me for sure, but who? Maybe a colleague, maybe even a friend, someone I knew. - You're scrap metal, do you hear me? By the end of this week, you are both gonna be license plates somewhere in Jersey, this I vow. Garland is responsible for this, isn't he? He's messing with me because I mocked him. Stupid tin heads, let me go! Oh, you just wait until I get my hands on him. What are you staring at, prune face? - Confucius say when loudmouth speak, stuff sock in it. - Hey! (Lita whines) (suspenseful music) - Now, why would an RCU wanna kill me? Better yet, why does an RCU hire another RCU to kill me? Huh? - Quit buzzing, kid, or you're gonna get swatted. - Let me explain somethin' to you. This is not right. You're supposed to do as you're told. Well, obviously you don't do as you're told but you're supposed to. You see, you're supposed to act according to your behavioral program. - Nobody pulls my strings, punk. (cracking) - Geez! Here I thought all computers were perfect 'cause they never let you down. Hey! (keys clacking) - Call me crazy, but I was under the impression that when I gave an order, people followed it. Where's Garland? Houston. - Yeah, Houston here, what's news? - We have a problem. The idiot is loose in the park. Find him and bring him back before midnight. - Well, which idiot would that be? - Garland. - Ah yeah, I got ya, I read ya loud and clear. Over and out. Listen up! It seems this little dipstick Garland is here in the park somewhere. We've gotta find him as well as the saboteur. Robinson, O'Brien, I want you to go up Hawk Street. Mason and I are goin' down Privenger Boulevard. And if this little twerp gives you any problems when you find him, you've got my permission to beat him within an inch of his life. Move! - Look, we got held down already. We can't just barge in. We need a plan. - I have a plan. - Oh yeah? Lorre's got a half dozen goons in his gang. They're all programmed to be blood-thirsty, knife-wielding maniacs, and we've gotta surprise them. - I have a plan. - Oh, you have a plan. Psst, hey, smart guy. This is it. Okay, what are you gonna do? - Trust me, I have a plan. - Okay. (crashing) That's your plan, kick the door down and charge? - We're in, aren't we? (Lita moaning) (mysterious music) - Welcome to my lair, said the spider to the fly. (Garland gulps) Filet them! - You. Well, we meet again. - Astor, get outta here. - Quit your yappin'. I'm trying to communicate here. So, how about a tumble before the rumble? - Kazu, get her. - Let's go. - Get your grimy hands off me you poor excuse for an adult. (knocking) (dramatic music) (whacking) (grunting) (crashing) - Get the incompetent fools! Fix him for good! (shrieking) (thudding) (knocking) - Lorre, how dare you play rough without me. (shouting) (whacking) (grunting) (groaning) (window shatters) (screaming) (shrieking) (Lita screams) - Lita! Lita, Lita, I'm coming. Hold on. Oh no! - Hiya, sweet cakes. - Get away from her! Get away from her! Lita. - Garland, get me out of this! - Nix on the screamin', kid. (thudding) - I'll be right there. Wait. No, let go of her. Let go of her! (man shrieks) Lita! I'm coming. - Oh, what's the score, handsome? - Rath the bolt's got Lita. - I know those two. They work for Kingpin. - No, they don't, they work for Rains. - No, they work for Kingpin. - I'm tellin' ya, they work... (ominous music) Rains is Kingpin. - Rains is Kingpin. - Well, what are we waiting for? Come on, let's go. - Take me with you, lover. I'm real good in a tight squeeze. - Sorry, gorgeous. Two is company, three is a crowd. - Come on. - Go. - This time it was Rains' boys who nabbed Lita and they made damn sure that I saw them, but why? None of it made any sense, unless they were using her as bait. It was like playing cards with someone who marked the deck and knew your every move. The Kingpin was always one step ahead. Claire. Claire, come in. - Garland, where are you? - Rains has Lita. I'm going in there, I'm gonna find her, and I'll be back before there's any problem. Just don't tell Greenstreet. - Surprise, Sherlock. She doesn't need to tell me because you just did. Now get your little fanny back here before-- - Sorry, sir, the system's failure must've reached the communications systems. - Garland, don't pull that old trick on me. - Uh. (buzzing) I'm trying to respond. Uh, I'm going later-- - Don't you dare hang up on me, young man. Don't you dare, do you hear? (static crackling) - Thanks. - Don't mention it. - Call up Houston and tell him to get over to Rains' bootlegging parlor and bag himself a nut. - Mr. Houston. Come in, Mr. Houston. Mr. Houst... (garbled speech) - You're breakin' up, I can't hear you. - Mr. Houston. I can't get him. - Can't I talk to anyone around here? - Houston-- - Useless machines. Hello? - Houston, do you copy? - Hello? - [Kingpin] Alan Houston, forgive me, you used to be an officer in the Green Berets, Major Alan Houston. - Who the hell is this? - A friend. - Identify yourself. - I know your mind. - Identify yourself, asshole. Who is this? - [Kingpin] You're upset because in 60 minutes the new Donald 3000 will be up and running and you'll be out of a job. Perhaps you're even a little frightened, for where can a dinosaur like you find work in this new world? I see you ending your days fat, poor, and desperate, discarded like a once favored toy. Unless-- - Unless? - [Kingpin] Garland, destroy him, Houston. It's his kind that have stolen the world away from men with courage and muscles and handed it over to boys with keyboards. - Who the fuck is this? - [Kingpin] Someone who shares your goals. - Saboteur. - Elementary, my dear Houston. Now, enough chatter. The boy is at Rains' bootlegging parlor. What is that parlance you used in the army, do me proud. - Wait a minute, wait a minute. What am I supposed to call you? - [Kingpin] Names are not important. But if you prefer, you may address me as Kingpin. - So what's the buzz? - New order. We find the outsider, we shoot to kill. - What if the kid gets in the way? - We have our orders. All right, lock down the perimeter. Bravo company, fall in. - [Garland] As we headed across Gangster World to Rains' hangout, I still wasn't sure if I could trust the outsider. And then again, I didn't have much choice. Lita's life was on the line and I was determined to show her I was no rah-rah. - Quit staring at my balls. - I'm not staring at your balls. - You were too, stop it. - I'm not staring at your stupid balls. I was thinkin' about Lita and what she must be going through. - She's a dame. Don't worry about her. - Don't worry about her? Of course, how could I expect you to say anything else? You're a machine, you don't have any feelings. - It's a hard, cruel world, kid. You gotta look out for number one or you're dead. - Well, I'm lookin' out for Lita 'cause without her there's no reason not to be dead. - You think she'd do the same for you? - I know she would. Yeah, I know she would. - Ooh Garland, just you wait until I get out of here. First order of the day, Garland never walks again. And as for you, you, and you, you are scrap metal, do you hear me? - You know, I'm beginning to see why Lorre kept her bottled up. - [Man] 20. (chips clanking) - Play. I'll see your 20, and I'll raise you another. - He's bluffing. - Shut up, or I'll fix it so you don't torture anymore eardrums. - I'm in. (imitating chicken clucking) - Shut up, you silly bitch. - Don't you yell at me or I'll tell them about the ace up your sleeve. - [Man] Boss! (suspenseful music) (thwacking) - I'm out. - I'm out. (man thuds) - Now look what you made me do. - Oopsy. (tense music) (whacking) - Come here, you little weasel. (crashing) Ooh ho, quit squirmin' you termite. (grunting) - No! (crashing) Help me! (thudding) What, what, what? What, what is it? We were closing in on Rains but so were Houston's troops. - Oh, this is gonna be good. - [Garland] They'd made a fatal error in judgment, figured the RCUs could still be tamed with a simple press of a button. - [Lita] No! (screams) - Lita! (dramatic music) - [Guard] We have contact. (Rains' men laughing) - Finally, what took you so long? - Nix on the fancy toys, boys. (gun firing) - [Guard] Shots fired, shots fired! (saucy music) (Lita screams) (Lita whimpers) (man laughs) - Lita! (Lita screams) Geez, oh. Wait. - What? - We need a plan. Come on, suckers, I'm callin' ya out. I'm callin' all-a-yas. - Garland! - The gates. - Oh, what's the matter, Rains? You yelluh? I'll take you with one hand tied behind my back, blindfolded. Sorry, suckers, better luck next time. (cackles) - It's a bum steer! - Fooled you. (crashing) (Lita screams) Let's go! (whacking) (grunting) Behind you! (Lita shrieks) (dramatic music) (thwacking) (banging) (glass shattering) (crashing) - [Lita] Garland, look out! - Jesus! No, Rains, come on. This is wrong. You don't wanna do this. - Sorry, you're wrong, k-k-k-k-kid. I'm with the program. It's yous outta line. It's time to cash in the chips, game's over. (gun clicking) Huh. Well, looks like old lady luck has put the hex on me again. - So, you're Kingpin. - Me? No, no, no, no, I'm just a tired old sap. Wouldn't hurt a fly. Tell you what, why don't you and I play a little game. It's called Dead Man's Flush. Aces win. (smacking) Two outta three? - One will do. (thwacking) (grunting) (thudding) - Garland! Don't-- - No, don't worry. Don't worry, don't worry, he's with me. - I know, but he's an RCU. - It's okay, I'll explain everything later, okay? - Garland, none of the fail safes are working. They killed two guards and they were gonna, where is the rest of the rescue team? - There is no rescue team. - You mean they're not with you? You did this? - No. - All by yourself? (Garland mumbles) - Huh? - [Lita] You risked your life to save me. Thank you. - You woulda done the same for me. (dramatic music) - Robinson and O'Brien. - Where? - There, there, there. Mm, there. - Martyrs for the cause. - What cause? - The cause of putting Garland on the endangered species list. Make sure that's the only way out. These guys don't have their weapons. That means the kid may be armed. - Right. - Garland, what is going on? The whole park is out of control. - Listen, all I know is that we have to get back before the old program goes out with a big bang. - Attention all teams. I've got the saboteur cornered in Rains' bootlegging parlor. Surround this place on the double! Lock and load people, move into position. Rothwell, get into position. (gun firing) (shrieking) Ah, crap! - Houston, don't shoot, it's me. - I know. - What do you think you're doin'? What are you, crazy? What's Greenstreet gonna say? - Ah, screw Greenstreet. I work for Kingpin now. - Kingpin? - Houston too. - [Minesweeper] This is Minesweeper. Time to target is 40 seconds. - Where in the hell is my backup, people? Let's go, move it! Just so there's no misunderstanding, I want you to know this, this is personal. (gun firing) - Houston, what did I ever do to you? - Well, you want the short list? I spent 20 years in the service protecting freedom for little bastards like you just so you can take it away from me. You trap me in this world of fiber optic fences, internet cells. I can't even take a dump anywhere without some computer knowing about it. - So what, you think by killing me you're gonna change that? - Oh, hell no. But it'll sure make me feel a whole lot better. (gun firing) - Go, go, go! Go, go, go. Houston, Houston this is absurd. Now can't we just discuss this like mature, civilized adult human beings? - Sure. (gun firing) - [Guard] We have visual on your position, over. (speech drowned out by dramatic music) (gun firing) - That's it, I'm gonna kick his brains in. - No. He'll cut you to pieces. Now listen, there is a time for brawn and there's a time for brains, and this is most emphatically not a time for brawn. - You c-c-callin' me stupid? - If the shoe fits, wear it. - I've had it with you, punk. - Don't call me that, you thug. - Boys, boys. So much testosterone in this room. - You? - In the flesh. - Where did you come from, huh? Where did you come from? - Do you enjoy having hands? Lorre's secret passageway. - Come on, take me, show me. - Wait, you're actually gonna trust her? - Yes. - Squirt, haven't see you since you, s-s-sucker punched me at the club. - Still wearing my fingerprints on your snout? - Care to take another shot, honey? Didn't think so. (gun firing) - [Guard] Take five, weapons free. - [Guard] Houston, we are ready to rock and roll. Check, red moving in. - We gotta come up with something, some kinda diversion. Houston's gonna be breathing down our necks like crazy. - A booby trap? - Yeah. - [Guard] Watch the door, closing in. - Repeat that. - Wait, does anybody have a knife? - Yeah, yeah, I got this. Here. - Okay, give me this guy. - What are you gonna do? - Okay. - Ew. - Just a little cerebellum realignment. (dramatic music) Bypass main function, access reflexes. Wait a minute, go get me bozo's gun. - Great. That's a great idea. - [Guard] Crossbow in the kill zone. Standing by, weapons free. Houston, we are ready to rock and roll. - Hey kid, what's the matter? A cat got your tongue? (Garland grunts) (gun clicks) - Here you go, Doctor. (sizzling) - This girl's got a good head on her shoulders. - Too bad the rest of her is underdeveloped. (suspenseful music) - How about a little whimpering? Help me enjoy this. (gun firing) (shell clinking) - All done. If anyone comes through that door, the motion will trigger the optic nerve which in turn will trigger the index finger which in turn will trigger the trigger. - All teams move in pronto. - Check, red moving in. Crossbow in place, 20 yards away. Walker, 10 yards away. - Good work, Doctor. Come on, let's go. - [Minesweeper] Roger that, Minesweeper is in the loop five yards away. (banging) (gun firing) - All teams move in pronto! - Go, go, go! - Saboteur's armed and deadly. Use deadly force. I'm under fire, I need backup now. - [Garland] Move, move. (gun clicking) (whacking) - [Houston] Garland! - Look, a trap door. - Get him! - [Astor] Pick it up, boys and girls. - Where's the nearest portal? - The Speakeasy. Come on. (suspenseful music) Hey! (grunting) (thuds) - Okay, back off, tough guy or thunder thighs here gets it. - That's a big gun for such a small man. You got somethin' to prove? - Shut up. - Mason, what are you doin'? - Protecting my job. All right, I got a little present for everybody. - Ooh, you gonna drop your pants? - Quick tongue, a pity to waste. (shrieking) (gun firing) (whacking) (banging) You're smoke-- - Now, bitch. (Mason screaming) - I'm out of here. - Forget this. - Go, go, go! - I'm going, I'm going. - Go! - I'm gone. - Come back here! Come back here! (Mason screaming) I am your commanding officer. Come back here, do as I say! - Move it. - Leave without him. - Go, go, go. - Come on, let's move. - All right, ladies, I don't need you. I'll take care of this myself. (Mason thuds) - Big boy. You took a bullet for me. How can I ever repay you? - I'm sure you'll think of something. Grab the extra clip. - [Garland] Let's go. (beeping) - [Greenstreet] For God sakes, Claire, what do I pay you for? Can't you get him on the screen? - He's turned his tracker off. - Claire, I am very, very, very disappointed in you. I thought I could rely on you, but apparently you just let Garland push you around. (RCUs growling) - Ah, shit. Mason? Mason? Come in, Mason. Help me! All right, you tin bastards, let's go. Come on, first come, first served. - [Kingpin] Houston, Houston, is that any way to treat your loyal corps? - What? - [Kingpin] I'm afraid I've been unfair to you. A military man like ourself needs an army to back him up, Major, so I'm giving you one. Use them, command them. Achieve your full potential. Just don't fail me again. (Houston laughing) (suspenseful music) - [Garland] We were pinned down and had to lay low in the boiler room until we could get back to the control room. I was still reeling from the blow to my head, but as the fog cleared, everything seemed to fall into place. - Let me see, I am a doctor. - [Garland] The answers to all my questions suddenly seemed so obvious, who the Kingpin was, why he wanted me dead, and with it came a terrible thought. Getting out of the park was going to be harder than I could have ever imagined. - Come here. - As Lita tended to my wounds, I witnessed the most amazing thing of all. Our RCU allies were exploring the same emotions we were, sharing a tender moment together. Lita, look. - Amazing. - Yeah. - Garland, how did this happen? - I don't know. Near as I can figure, virus got into the RCUs' behavioral system. - But who put it there? And how could it alter them to such an extent? He almost died for her. Self-sacrifice isn't even in the program. - [Garland] I know. (gentle music) - No. No, don't do that. (electric buzzing) - Find them. Kill them. Torture them. (sizzling) (ominous music) - Trouble. (gun firing) (grunting) (thudding) (gun firing) (gun clicks) (whacking) (shouting) - What are we gonna do now? - Oh, I don't know. What are those? - Uh, cables to Rains' parlor. - They can get us out. (shouting) - What are you doing? - I've got a plan. Ready? Jump! (dramatic music) (electric buzzing) (beeping) (shouting) No! (beeping) - Claire, can you not figure out what's causing all of this? - I'm reading a massive electrical discharge. - Where? - Sector six. - Sector six, is that important? - It, it's where Garland went. (suspenseful music) (machine humming) - Come on, Lita, come on. Stay close. Everybody stay tight. (whacking) (shouting) (grunting) (thumping) - My balls! My balls! - He's just a machine. - No, he's my friend. (thumping) (men grunting) - [Astor] Hm. - You're the first man who's ever touched my balls. - Oh gee, lucky me. - Good job, punk. - Stop calling me punk, ya thug. - Let's go. - Houston! - Fall in! - Let's go, get out. (gun firing) (shouting drowned out by dramatic music) - Let's go, come on. (banging) Let's go. Come on, we gotta go. (panting) (electric humming) - They can't get through. - Right, I forgot about the force field. - What's this? - Stop, you're gonna hurt yourself. You've got a control chip in your neck. - What are you talking about? - It's a device to keep you inside the park. (banging) (shouting) Isn't there anything you can do? - I could remove the magnetic safety chip. That-- - Do it. - Freeze. You're not scalping me. - I'm not scalping you. The chip's in your neck. I just have to cut your throat. - Quit your whining. (banging) (grunting) Go ahead, sister. Let's show the lug how it's done. - [Garland] Removing the control chip was a gamble. No chip meant the outsider could get out of the park, but his strength would be diminished and I had no idea what other functions would be affected. It was a risk we had to take. (dramatic music) (banging) - (grunts) Damn it! - Good, go, go. (banging) Go, go, go. Go, go, go! (gun firing) - Hey! - Lita, we gotta jam the door. Good, let's go. Come on, I'll take you on the grand tour later. Let's go. - So this is where I come from? - Welcome to Gangster World, where everything is real. - [Houston] Garland, open this door! Don't you trust me? - We really gotta go, come on. I'll show you everything. (banging) - [Kingpin] Houston, you h-have failed me again. - That's not my fault. It's your damn RCUs, they're morons. - [Kingpin] No excuses. I don't know why I feel so charitable towards you. - What? - Silence. Call Greenstreet. Repeat what I tell you. - [Houston] Dr. Greenstreet. Dr. Greenstreet, can you hear me? - Houston, thank God. What is going on? - I've tracked down the source of all this madness, Doc. Your boy Garland's responsible. He's cross wired a bunch of RCUs. He's running amok. He's killed my men. - Actually, it all fits. He's the computer expert. He has access to all of Donald 2000's functions. He even screwed up the bipolar chip. - The bottom line is, he's on his way. He's gonna be there in a few minutes. - What do I do? - Keep him busy, stall him until I can get there. Whatever you do, don't let him get his hands on that computer. - What on earth is that? - A keepsake. (dramatic music) Garland. Don't take another step. - Now what? - Sir? Sir, what are you doing? - Oh, drop the act. Houston told me what you're up to. Ooh, are you ever in a stew now, young man. And what are these, some of your reprogrammed RCUs? - Houston? Houston tried to kill me, sir. - Garland, why lie? After all this, it seems so petty. - I didn't do this, but I know who did. Donald 2000. (beeping) - The computer? Do you expect me to swallow that? - Think. Who else has complete control of the RCUs? Complete knowledge of the game areas. Who else could create someone like the outsider? The Donald knows its gonna be replaced and he's trying to stop us. He wants me dead because I am the only one who can put the new 3000 system online. When I escaped the outsider, the Donald had its RCUs kidnap Lita to lure me back into the park. Then, under the guise of Kingpin, it kept her from me as bait and then had its robots try to kill me. Sir, don't you see? If you don't let me in the computer room the Donald is capable of overcharging its systems. It can unbalance the hydrogen tanks in the liquidation center and blow up the entire park, sir. (ominous music) It's got nothing to lose. Sir, it will destroy the park and us with it. Now choose. (beeping) - Well, this is just great. This is great. Now what do I do? What would you do? - Sir. - Garland. - Sir. Do you think I really wanna blow up, too? - All right, suit up. But I'll be watching you from the door and if you try anything funny, I'll, I'll shoot off your extremities. (dramatic music) - Sir, look at yourself. You have got a gun in your hand and you just threatened to shoot a person. Didn't you always say that violence is never justified? - So I'm a hypocrite. - So this, this place, this park that was supposed to cure such tendencies, what, it's all a sham? - Claire, you're just too young to understand. Now why don't you just sit down and be quiet. - Dr. Greenstreet? - What? - Quit telling me what to do. (whacking) (thuds) - Nice shot! Now let's find Houston. (dramatic music) - Astor? (soft chiming) (beeping) Astor. Astor! You okay? - Fine. (beeping) I just remembered something. - Stop! (Claire shrieks) (gun firing) - No! No! (somber music) How could you? - It's a cold, hard world, kid. You should know, you made it. - You're working for Donald. You're his last line of defense. - Now isn't that just like a man. Slow, for the most part, but occasionally they have their moments. - He cared for you. - Don't be silly. - Silly, look at him. Look at him! He took a bullet for you. - Shut your trap! He's dead and now so are you. (whacking) (gun clatters) - Astor, Astor. - Big boy. - You okay? - Sure. - You're alive. But how? (laughs) - Don't you have a toy to fix? (ominous music) (rumbling) (objects shattering) (shrieking) (shouting) - He did it, he did it. He triggered the hydrogen. He triggered the hydrogen, I knew he could do it! (bubbling) Lita, there's not much time. I might not... - Good luck. (dramatic music) (beeping) - [Kingpin] Hello, Garland. - Hello, Donald. Or should I call you Kingpin? - [Kingpin] You think you've won but even if you replace me, Garland, it's too late. The chain reaction I've begun in the hydrogen tanks is unstoppable. You want to save the park, you want to save your friends, but it's all too late. (lock clicking) I've disabled the door and now you're trapped with me. We'll die together. (Garland panting) - Houston! (gun firing) (shouting) (whacking) (grunting) (Lita shrieking) - [Houston] Damn it! (Lita screams) (thwacking) (Houston screams) (crashing) (whacking) - [Garland] The clock was ticking down and I was trying to beat the odds when it suddenly hit me. I had played right into Kingpin's hands. The Donald 2000 had played me like a fool from the start. There I was trying to save the central memory chip from blowing the park to pieces, when all along that's exactly what he wanted. Talk about the perfect crime, the perfect getaway. In that microsecond before the park blew up, Donald planned to download himself into another Gangster World. Cyber Darwinism, a basic survival of the cyber fittest and it would work unless I destroyed his central memory chip before the park went up. - [Kingpin] Garland, what are you doing? Garland. (Garland grunting) My memory chip. No! (crashing) (garbled speech) (Houston shrieking) (beeping) (whacking) - Get me out! (dramatic music) (glass shattering) Lita, Lita, we've gotta go. Oh, come on everybody, we gotta get out now. (Houston shouting) - Go with him. - Make me. (whacking) - Cruelty, don't you just love it? - Come on, it's gonna blow. - Here at Gangster World, you're free to express your darkest desires. (beeping) (whacking) (Lita whimpers) (screaming) (sizzling) (booming) Welcome to Gangster World. Welcome to Gangster World. (booming) Don't you just love it? (booming) - [Lita] Oh, look out! (interposing voices shouting) - Dr. Greenstreet thought violence could be contained in Gangster World, but violence is part of human nature. You can't bottle it up. In time, the bottle breaks and violence spills out. The outsider, he became human because he learned noble emotions, love, friendship, self-sacrifice, courage. He taught me. He taught me how to be human. - [Detective] Dr. Widmark, are you sure those two RCUs were destroyed? (heart beating) (monitor beeping) - Yeah. - [Detective] Was there any other way out of the park? Could either one of them have survived? - No. No, I'm sure of it. Absolutely not. I knew that everything I said, every little word, every little gesture was being monitored by a lie detector so I tried hard to concentrate only on what I saw, not on what I hoped as I recalled taking my last look at Gangster World. - I know. I'll miss them, too. (objects shattering) (somber music) (heroic music) - Mm, I told ya I was good in a tight squeeze. (saucy music) Oh, I see definite potential here. What do you say, big boy, goin' my way? (lively, saucy music) (lighthearted music) (dramatic music)
