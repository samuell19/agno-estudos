- When I stood up at my mom's memorial service, I said, "My mother, the criminal," and everybody laughed because they knew. I don't think of myself as a criminal. I know that what I'm doing is against the law. That's what civil disobedience is, it's breaking the law, and part of civil disobedience is accepting the consequences. I do accept the consequences. - I am sending congress one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history. - Donald Trump today called for more and more military spending. More troops, more ships, more submarines, more planes. If you compare it based on military spending to the top 10 nations in the world, add the US, and look at this. Almost 600 billion in spending there almost as much as all the other nine of the top ten combined. - An empire costs a lot of money. - The United States already has by far the largest military budget in the world. - The US has spent 189 of its 235 years at war. In 2010, the US spent more on its military than the next 10 highest countries combined. - President Trump's morally bankrupt budget will funnel more money to the Pentagon at the expense of the poor. This is an awful idea. - We must learn from the mistakes of the past. We have seen the war and the destruction. This history should give us all faith in the possibilities for a better world. - Taxpayers are estimated to spend 122 billion dollars, the same amount that count cover an estimated 25 million Americans with low income healthcare. - President Trump tweeted that his budget proposal puts America first. Must make safety its number one priority. It represents the biggest military buildup since the 1980s, and the most sweeping reductions in other spending since World War II. - Federal income taxes are the taxes that pay for the expenses that are under the control of Congress. Federal income taxes don't pay for Social Security, don't pay for Medicare. But they pay for war, for the military. Some people don't like to say war, they like to say defense. Defense. Federal income taxes pay for defense, for nuclear weapons, for all the military hardware, for all the services. And I am a conscientious objector. I am pacifist. I don't believe in violence. I cannot in good conscience pay, what is almost always about 50% of the amount of the federal income tax goes to the military. And I can't do it. - I am willing to pay taxes to provide national defense for my country, to see that we have an army, a navy and airplanes strong enough to protect us against any invaders. - Every American agrees that our country's defenses must be so strong that no nation would dare attack us. Everything thinking patriotic American favors this country building up its national defenses at once. No one today disputes the need for a powerful army, navy and air force for our national defense, for these taxes are willingly paid. The government has no money of its own except what it takes directly and indirectly in levies and taxes from every pay envelope. Every time my lady dresses, she dons as many taxes as she does clothes. When we relax and seek pleasure and entertainment, Mr. Taxes always joins us, and we must pay for him, too. But liberty survives only for those who are wise enough and strong enough to preserve it. It is in our self-interest to preserve the heritage handed down to us by our fearless forefathers, and speedily become so strong no foe would dare attack us. - Most people who are war tax resisters pay into the social security system, pay into the medicare system, pay other taxes, they just don't pay the federal income tax because that is the tax that goes to fund the military. I don't pay any of my federal income taxes because 50% of anything I pay will go to the military. That's my rationale for that. I had inherited a million dollars from my dad when he died last June 11th, and I've been resisting taxes because of the amount of money that goes to war for quite a long time, not continuously, but quite a long time, and had last year. So I put all the figures for my income tax, I file, honestly, correctly, and then when it comes down to the amount that I owe, I just say no thank you, not going to do that part of it. And then I send it off and I usually send a letter, then I send it to my congress people, and senators, and a few other people. April 18th, 2017, Internal Revenue Service, Washington, DC. Copies to US Senator Mark Warner, US Senator Tim Kaine, US Representative Robert Goodlatte. I have happily just passed the 10 month mark of my first year of massive resistance. I marked this new beginning of my life on June 11th, 2016, with the death of my father, and with my commitment to redirect as much of my inheritance to make a better world. I cannot in good conscience pay for war. I have donated more than that amount to meet human needs internationally, and nationally, and locally. To honor my father and mother, I am trying to do as they did many times in their lives in trying to directly help the less fortunate. I do not know what the justice system will do when I refuse to pay my federal taxes in April. I am a little bit scared of what they might do, just as I was scared in 1985 when they took me to court. But sometimes, as my parents knew, and as they taught me by their example, you have to do what you have to do because it is clearly and conscientiously the right thing to do. I take this action of war tax resistance as I have over the years, with a combination of fear and pride. I take this action of resisting and redirecting federal income taxes because my conscience will not allow me to do otherwise. Sincerely, Larry Bassett. Sometimes, you feel pretty isolated because you say to a group of people, "I'm a war tax resister, "and I don't pay my federal income taxes." And they say back to you, "Aren't you afraid of going to jail?" And you don't wanna have that conversation over and over again, particularly. Or worse than that, they say nothing, or they kind of turn away and walk off to walk to somebody else. Because it's not an easy topic for most people to talk about. I never feel particularly brave. I think about the reason that I'm doing this, which is because I can't imagine, like, pulling a trigger and having a bullet go into another person, or dropping a bomb and knowing that it might tear another person into pieces, that scares me. What war does to people, that scares me. People are trained to kill other people. That doesn't seem like that's a natural way for a person to be, but that's what the military trains people to do, is to kill other people. To me, that's pretty scary. So I think what I'm doing, it requires a certain amount of determination. I do tell myself pretty often all they really want is the money, they really want to injure me, they don't want to put me in jail. But am I willing to go to jail? Well, yeah, I'd be willing to do that. My goal is to say to the government, "What you're doing with my tax money, "with our tax money is not what I want to be happening." So here I am, quivering a little bit, because it is scary, and feeling proud, because it is the right thing to do, and being glad I don't have to be in the position of killing another person, either with my money or with my body. In the family, there's some conversation about who led who down this path, and it was a little bit of both. Where I started was probably before I knew about kind of where my parents were politically. I mean, they were Republicans when I was growing up and living at home. And my dad was a business manager, but when I was in college, it was the time of Vietnam, the American war in Vietnam, and I was about to be drafted possibly. A lot of things were happening with the draft around then, but there was a period of time where I was 1A, which meant top of the list, and they picked numbers out of a hat, kind of. So there was a period of time where I was possibly gonna be drafted, and that's when I decided I wasn't gonna go off and kill somebody. Wasn't gonna happen. And where did that come from? I don't think I know the answer to that exactly. It apparently was just a part of me. My dad was in World War II. He wasn't a gung-ho soldier. He was kind of in the administrative corps. He was one day behind all the battles, doing the paperwork. And my mom was a housewife. Like I say, eventually, kind of where I was at in terms of my politics and where they were at kind of merged, and we kind of helped each other. In 1985, they took me to court to make me tell them where my assets were. They were trying to collect and they couldn't find any assets. I didn't tell 'em I didn't have any. But they took me to court to force me to tell them where my assets were. And the court decided that I didn't have to tell them where my assets were, and that was a pretty major breakthrough, and still stands today that the IRS cannot force people to divulge their assets. Back then, I didn't have assets. Now, I'm 70, and I have some assets. Sometimes, people find it hard to get grips on war tax resistance. What's the point? Well, I think it's pretty simple. What if somebody came up to your door of your house with a cup and said, "I'm collecting money to kill people "on the other side of the world?" Would you make a donation? Of course, the person coming to your door, to my door, is the government, represented by the IRS, and they're asking you to give money to kill somebody on the other side of the world. People pay and people get killed. - Let's start with you and what you want. What does anybody want? Do you think you're different from other people? Let's get this straight. All around the world, men want the same things, food, shelter and comforts, and naturally, selfishly want all they can get. You do, I do. Everybody has this in common. There's a good reason why we have the best workers, why we're about eight to one better off than the rest of the whole world. How do you think this came to be? What makes us tick? Let's talk about how we got what we have in these United States. - My feeling right now is that I really want the IRS to do something because I don't want them to kind of keep this low key, because the idea with war tax resistance for me is that you don't pay the government, but you don't keep the money, you try to do good things with the money. I have given away about $150,000 to do good work from my point of view. And I know that has a made a difference. I know it has made a difference for the few people in other countries who I've given money directly to. I know it made a difference. In each of those situations, there've been complications. Because dealing with people who are living in extreme poverty is complicated. And I can say, well, I tried not to make them dependent on me, because I knew I would not be able to continue to provide assistance, but of course, when you get to know people, things can get complicated. And it's been hard because being poor, being extraordinarily poor, and being surrounded by, in the case of the orphanage, with little kids who have a hard life... Can sometimes create desperate situations. And you don't know how, I didn't know how to deal with that all of the time. Because I would have people saying, "If you don't send me money, these kids are gonna die." When you're actually dealing with people who are living in those circumstances, for me, it was a life-changing situation. When I can be sending checks off to places for $1000, it's felt fairly significant, and I knew that would end, I knew that would end with these half a dozen people in other countries and I tried to let them know that, that there was an end time. And right now, I am at that end time, so I have had to say to people, "I don't have the money to send anymore." I've had to draw that line. And of course, I can feel pretty guilty about that because, of course, I still, I don't have the million dollars anymore, that is all gone, but I have a lot more money than most people in the world. Will it ever make a difference? Well, we always have to hope that it'll make a difference. We always have to hope that it'll make a difference. - Taxes are due today, and if you owe money and skip out on your payment, you could face some serious consequences. - Not for war and occupation! - Money for jobs and education! - Not for war and occupation! - We are here in the anti-war movement! - About 150 Tax Day marches are planned in cities across the country today. - 54 cents of every dollar Americans pay in taxes goes to funding past and future wars, yet 51% of Americans polled would rather cut military spending than sacrifice social programs. Defense spending in the US has increased 81% since 2001. - Donald Trump's budget proposal calls for deep cuts in domestic programs to fund a major increase in defense spending. - And there were about 150 Tax Day protests demanding to see the president's tax returns. - Trump said repeatedly during the campaign that he couldn't release his taxes. - You never give a tax return when you're being audited. Do you know I get audited every single year? - 68% of Americans want President Trump to release his tax returns. - I'm under a routine audit, and it'll be released, and as soon as the audit's finished, it'll be released. - He's not going to release his tax returns. We litigated this all through the election. People didn't care, they voted for him. - We do care, we are here, we demand to see his taxes. - 54 billion dollars of spending on new planes, new ships, and new equipment for the military. Where's that money coming from? The White House says there'll be cuts to other parts of government. - Now one thing is for sure, the money though, it keeps rolling in, and those profits for defense companies keep piling higher and higher. - While the government takes our taxpayer money and uses it toward this type of waste, they distract us with the wall, and Mexicans, and Muslims, and black people. Who cares about affordable housing and making sure that people aren't living on the streets? We gotta fund the military because these private contractors gotta make money. - I said, "Why can you force me to do that?" What if I raise my hand and say, "No, I don't want to fund your wars anymore?" - Once again, middle class people, working families are gonna be hurt. - This budget is not a statement of values of anyone. President Trump has shown that he does not value the future of our children and working families. This budget is really a slap in the face of the future. - You know, I still have this kind of wish that I had five more minutes with my dad to say, "Dad, you know where this is headed." But I think he knew exactly where this was headed. My mom, she had stopped going to school because she had kids, me and my sister, and she was sort of the traditional say at home mom. Both of my parents were very moved by my experience in 1985 with the federal court. My mom came to the court hearings from Michigan to New York City. My dad wrote a letter to the judge. But they were significantly motivated by that, what they thought was a pretty incredible action on the part of their son. They became activists in their own right, and they were peace activists, and my mother, with the support of my dad, was actually arrested twice for civil disobedience. She did what is a fairly typical civil disobedience action of crossing some imaginary line at some military establishment, and she was actually sentenced to jail twice in Michigan, once for 30 days and once for 60 days, and was just fearless, and had all of the experiences of being in jail. In fact, she missed the wedding of my second son, her grandson, because she was in jail. And she and my dad worked on poverty issues, and totally supported the things that I did in my life about peace activism. And I think we kind of supported each other. We sort of, people say, well, so you kind of followed in the path of your parents. And I would have to say I'm not really quite sure who followed who. Both my parents were there for me whenever I needed them in terms of they were a big part of my support system. How would I feel if they did collect? I'm prepared for them to collect. I know that I am collectible if they can find it. I hope they won't be able to find it. I've tried to do some things about the obvious places they might look, which is not to have very much money in obvious places where they might find it, but I understand that they might collect. The local art of Larry Bassett, May, 2017. I decided early in my life to try to match my life with my values. My values have led me to refuse to pay for war, redirecting my federal income taxes to work for peace and justice and to meet many human needs. My values have led me to support local arts in the best way that I know how. I value artistic expression and have chosen to support many local artists. I love being surrounded by local art that I have selected piece by piece over the years. - Please join us not only to view this sophisticated collection in our main gallery, but also help us celebrate art collectors like Larry Bassett who support thriving art communities. We appreciate him. - Hi. I'm going to talk briefly about values. My values. My parents taught me to value other people. That value came strongly into play when I was faced with the potential of being drafted to go to war in Vietnam to kill people. I thought that rather than do that, I would go to Canada or to prison. And later in life I decided I would not pay federal income taxes so that other people would not have to go to war. One of the ways we show what we value is how we spend our money. I refuse to spend my money on war and preparation for war, something my government regrettably excels in. I value helping to meet human needs and have donated considerable money in an effort to help people. I have directly supported many local artists by buying their work. I am delighted to be here tonight surrounded by many wonderful works of art that I have purchased one at a time. I would be hard pressed to pick a favorite. I have many favorites and have valued knowing the artists who created each piece of art that you see here tonight. I love this place and I love this art, and I really love the fact that people have come out to see it, so thank you all so much. My goal has always been to make it possible for more people to see my local art collection, and this exhibit is an incredible realization of that goal. I hope the fact that you have come to this exhibit will help you to decide to buy that next piece of local art, because that is exactly what I have done. I never really did anything to earn the gift of being a millionaire, and I don't really feel like, I don't know what a millionaire feels like, but I don't feel like a millionaire. I kinda say that because it sounds like kind of an American thing to say, right? I had a million dollars. Well, okay, check. Did that one. So for me, giving money to good organizations is a pretty enjoyable experience. And that had to cover the amount that I wasn't going to pay in taxes, but there was still a pretty good chunk of money left. And one of the things I did, which I wouldn't have been able to do otherwise, was that I basically made a down payment on a life care facility so that in 10 or 20 years when I can't live by myself, when I can't take care of myself, I can go and live in this facility which is in town, and which is pretty highly regarded. - No. No, no big parties. No, I just, I thought taking care of my future was a pretty... Amazing thing to be able to do. 'Cause I had wondered how I was gonna deal with that, so that was a real positive thing. I also helped my older daughter with some education expenses, and I put some money aside to help my younger daughter with future education expenses. So, and-- - Nothing. I didn't, you know, I'm trying to think. I eat out more. It means I can have a stout and a nice salad, and I can eat at Loretta's practically whenever I want. So I don't have any financial concerns for my future. I'm in good shape. I've lived a lot of my life with pretty low income, so I don't need a lot of money. Bank accounts are pretty susceptible to IRS, so I gotta work on keeping not too much money in my bank account. If I had one. Taxes to keep them flying, taxes to keep them rolling, taxes to keep them coming, taxes to beat to earth the evil destroyer of freedom and peace! This is our fight. The fight for freedom. Freedom of speech, of worship, freedom from want and fear. Taxes will keep democracy on the march! - I try to value others lives the same as me. My 14-year-old daughter was born in China. She had a pretty difficult first three and a half years of her life. It reminds me how difficult things are, because we don't know, but we we think her parents, when she was born, she had a cleft pallet and cleft lip, so she couldn't breastfeed, she couldn't suck. She was abandoned when she was a few months old, which is, at least in that era, when girls were abandoned, they were usually abandoned at birth. So her parents, or her mother at least, tried to keep her, to keep her alive. She was starving to death, and her mother had to decide what am I gonna do? I have a starving child and I can't fix this. And her solution, or their solution, was to put her in a safe place where somebody would find her, and now she's my daughter. But she knows she has two parents, at least one of whom had to make an incredibly, we think, difficult decision. And how can you not want to make a world where that wouldn't have to happen to somebody? It's interesting, I have, my oldest son, actually, the one who was born during Vietnam who kept me out of the war, is my most conservative child, and he is pretty unhappy with what I've done. He's also worked as a defense department contractor, and we was initially, way back when, pretty worried that I was gonna mess with his clearance. I don't, I didn't. So Shaun... Is my problem child. Or I'm his problem parent, I should say. Shaun is the only one that it's been, as far as I know, a problem for, and that hurts. I, and I don't know what to do about that. It's on my bucket list. Work it out with Shaun. But it's a little complicated. My 24-year-old daughter Anna has been a world traveler, and I thought wanted to work on international conflict resolution. She may be kind of shifting her focus a little bit at this point, but she's lived in countries where there has been serious problems. Like Cambodia, Rwanda, Sri Lanka. Three countries where there have been serious upheavals. She doesn't exactly follow my line of thinking, but she's my kid so far who's gonna change the world. But I like it! - It looks nice. - I mean, I'm thinking about bringing some of the things up from the gallery. - Uh-huh. - And where they're going to fit in. - Yeah. - But I'm kind of acclimating myself to it being spread out instead of being so concentrated. - Yeah. What is that's so important to you about getting a reaction from these people? - Mostly, I think that if you don't get a reaction, they haven't heard ya. And what is the point of my doing this if the people who could make it be different don't hear ya? - Mm-hmm. - I'm pretty sure they must have heard me. I mean, I've sent them all letters. I mean, it's like the old thing about bein' the fly on the wall. You don't know. And I remember at least those couple of experiences that I had back during the 1985 thing, and you've probably heard me talk about these. It's like having the experience with the auditor at the IRS saying, "I'm with ya." - Hm! - Or going to a group and giving a presentation about war tax resistance, and having a woman come up to you afterwards and saying, "You know, my husband works for the IRS "and is a collection agent, "and he was assigned your case, "and he asked to have somebody else do it "because he didn't feel like he could "in good conscience--" - Wow. - "Pursue you." So in those kinds of cases, you know somebody has heard you. But what you really want, even though you kind of know you're not gonna change the government of the United States, war tax resistance is kind of one of those things where you say, well, if just I do it, so what? But if 10,000 people did it, you know, it's the Arlo Guthrie. And if 50 people a day came in and sang a bar of Alice's Restaurant, they might think it's a movement. And that's, I want them, I want the change to happen. And you never know! We always say to people who are worried about becoming war tax resisters, we always say what the IRS really wants is the money. - Yeah. - And for me, I'm prepared for them to get the money. You know, it's a lot of money, but if they get the money, they get the money. But it kinda depends on how they get it. - Yeah, I would say I'm afraid, too, for you, and for what might happen, and not knowing what might happen. And it's definitely hard as someone in social work school learning about how horrible prison is, and working for prison abolition, to think about my dad going through that experience and-- - Remember, I'm going to jail, not to prison. - That's true, jail. - It is a big difference. - That is a big difference. - It is a big difference. I'm really not eager to go to jail. I know my mom, she went to jail once for 30 days and once for 60 days, and 60 days was a long time, and she had a pretty hard time with that. She wasn't much different in age than I am now, so it was hard. So I'm kind of being brave. It's still scary. - Yeah. - But I sort of don't know what else to do about it. Because I am sort of on this path. I mean, this is the path that I've started down, and I don't know what else to do. - Are you a patriotic American? Then there's something important you can do! You won't get a medal for doing it, it may mean a sacrifice on your part. Shall I tell you what it is? Your income tax! Yes, and it's your privilege, not just your duty, but your privilege to help your government by paying your tax and paying it promptly. Your country is at war! Your country needs taxes for guns, taxes for ships, taxes for democracy! Now how about your income tax? - I been thinkin' about, like, the moment at which I thought I was something. I didn't know the term pacifist, but I've been thinkin' about it, and as I've been talkin' about it, I always have said it was when I was like about 20 and I was maybe gonna be drafted. But there's another story about my younger life that I think is a key part of that awareness of my total aversion to killing, which is really what it is. I mean, I can't imagine a pointing a gun at somebody, and pulling the trigger, and having what happens happen. But when I was 13 or 14, I raised guinea pigs. And I put the boy guinea pigs with the girl guinea pigs, and we had baby guinea pigs. And people might not know it, but guinea pigs are pretty cute, and when they're born, they got little guinea pigs. They got fur, and they got their little black eyes, and they're like miniature guinea pigs. And they were adorable, and I loved them, but one day, I came out and there was a guinea pig that had one bloody missing limb. So I went into the house and got a cotton ball, and got some chloroform or whatever the equivalent was, and I held this cute living pig, and I put this stuff over his face until he was dead. And I'm telling this in kind of a lighthearted humorous way, but it was terrifying to me, and I have really never gotten over that moment. It was, you know, might be as I'm fading off into the next world at the age of 95 or 96, that might be the last thing I'll be thinking about. It's hung onto me, the idea of actually, physically killing something. Gives me the shivers. I don't consider myself a criminal. I do know that I'm breaking the law, and I think I'm breaking the law because it's a bad law. If somebody was angry with me or what I was doing, they would certainly say I was a criminal, and when the Justice Department, the IRS, took me to court in 1985, they were certainly saying that what I was doing was against the law and they were going to prosecute me for doing it. They didn't think it was such a good idea, what I was doing. So, you know, the fact that the judge ultimately ruled against them and for me said, okay, you're not a criminal. I don't feel brave at all, and I always like to tell 'em, well, when the federal marshals came to my house in 1985 to serve me with the subpoena to court, I hid behind the refrigerator. So yeah, no, I'm not real brave. I'm just kinda doin' what it seems like I've gotta do. - Maybe currently being involved in seven different interventions around the world is not a good idea. Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, Pakistan, Yemen, Somalia, Libya. I mean, 45,000 people die every year because they don't have access to basic healthcare in America. And when you do botched military raid as Trump did with his first military raid, and you kill 30 civilians including an eight-year-old girl, that's what happened in Trump's first raid. And Obama's no angel on this front, either. 90% of the people under Obama who were hit with drones were not the intended target. So you keep killing all these innocent people, guess what, it's gonna come back to ya. - Tax year 2016, so that's last year, for a total due to the IRS, the US government, at this time of $130,940.44. Yeah, this is, I don't think this is any new information. But they're just saying you stepped over the line. So when people do civil disobedience, sometimes the police will say, "If you step over this line, you're gonna get arrested." So this is the IRS saying, "You've stepped over the line, "and if you don't follow up appropriately with us, "bad things will happen." Kinda reminds me of my mom, because when my mom went to jail, what she realized is who was in jail, and that somethin' had to be done, somethin' had to be done to change that system. Because the wrong people were in jail. Poor people were in jail. - I don't know. That's a tough question. That's not a good question to ask a pacifist, probably. Pacifist might say nobody really oughta be in jail. I'm not an intellectual pacifist. It's kind of a gut thing for me. You know, I always remember, because I think that one of the, it's like if you were in the presence of somebody, what was the question? I mean, there was a question that was if somebody was killing your sister, would you just stand there and let them do it, kind of a question. It was sort of like the non-violence issue, how can you react to violence non-violently, especially if somebody is attacking you. It's kind of like the turn the other cheek. Most people don't buy that. - Do I love America? I really have liked my life. I've done a lot of things in my life. I have no idea what it would be like someplace else. I don't consider myself patriotic in the sense that my country, right or wrong. I am patriotic in the sense of my country, right. But when my country is wrong, I'm not happy about it. So all this stirring around in the soul of a 20-something guy, me, who's now a 70-year-old guy, me, who the IRS is still trying to convince that I ought to use that envelope to send my money back to them, and is still saying to them not on my life. Not gonna do that. I'm not much of one for dragging myself down for what I didn't do. I try to focus on what I have been able to do. I try to keep a positive focus on what I have tried to do. And at this point in my life, I feel pretty good about it. I don't like how the world is, and I know, and I've known ever since I've been doing war tax resistance that no general has ever been short on his paycheck because of it, and I realize that even this year where I didn't pay over $100,000, that's like a 10th of a small missile. So in terms of having any real impact on the military, zilch. But I know that the $150,000 I've given away has had an impact. I know that, and I feel good about that.
