It was a time or miracles... cursis... of Gods... and men who believed they were Gods. Of a young warrior who became pharaon of the mightiest empire or the known world. A man, who defied the God or the Hebrew's. Rameses the Great. According to Biblical tradition, his beloved firstborn son was struck down by God in the last and most terrible of 10 plagues. A plague that forced the pharaon to free his Hebrew slaves and their leader Moses so that they could begin the long journey to freedom... known as the Exodus. Deep in the Valley of the King's, world-famous egyptologist Kent Weeks believes he has found the skull of Rameses' firstborn son. It was here in this pit that we found the human remains of an individual I belive could well be the firstborn ton of the pharaon Rameses II. Now for the first time, a scientiric team will enter the tomb to solve a 3000-year-old mystery. They will use the latest reconstructive techniques to work out ir they really have round Rameses' firstborn gon by recreating his face and the face or his famous father. forengic gcience will attempt to egtabligh how old he was when he died. And what ig the wound on the gide or his head? Did he die from a mygterioug Biblical plague or did he meet a brutal and violent end? the invegtigation will take the team all over Egypt, piecing together ancient clueg about the Exodus Moses and what really happened to Rameses' firstborn gon. Was he was killed by the hand or God or man? 'And it came to pass... the lord looked through the pillar or fire and cloud and did trouble the host of the Egyptians. The Exodus. An epic clash between the greatest of all pharaons and the Hebrew God and His chosen People.

Rameses was only 20 when he took the throne. He was already married to one or Egypt'g legendary beautieg - Nefertari. Revered ag a living goddegg, ghe became his chier queen. A wire, lover, and congtant companion. And it was Nefertari who bore Rameses his firstborn gon Amun-Her-Khepegher, trown Prince or Egypt. Amun-her-khepetheF wat the eldett ton of Rameses II. And being the eldett ton, of courte, he wat dettined to take aFter hit Father at king. lngcriptiong tell ug that Amun-her- khepegher was Rameses' chogen heir. Raiged in the royal court, he was rated to continue the dynagty; cementing the glory or his rorefatherg. But he never became ruler or Egypt. When and how he died Egyptian recordg do not gay. According to the Bible, he perighed in the Iagt or 1 O great plagueg that gwept Egypt gtruck down by God himgelr. At the hour of midnight l will go out into the midtt of Egypt: and all of the Firttborn in the land thall die... for 3000 yearg his lagt regting place was logt. But now a skull believed to be his has been found in a tomb by renowned egyptologist Kent Weeks. Unearthed in Egypt's Valley of the Kings, ancient burial ground or the pharaons the tomb was one or the greatest finds of the 20th century. Bigger than any other underground tomb discovered in Egypt, it's a labyrinth or over 100 rooms and corridors containing a find or Biblical significance. This is it, this is the skull. Is this skull the missing link between the history or Egypt and the story or the Exodus? Weeks has spent the best part of his life digging in Egypt. He lives on a houseboat on the Nile, near the Valley of the Kings. A schoolboy archaeologist turned real-life Indiana Jones, he's living a childhood dream. Since l was 8 yeart old there it nothing l wanted to do except be an Egyptologitt. No place I wanted to work except in Egypt. And I have never waivered in that. Thit it truly, one of the most rewarding ways I can think of to spend a life. Finding tomb KV-5 was a masterstroke or detective work. First unearest nearly 2 centuries ago, it was rediscovered when Weeks launched an ambitious project to map the temples, monuments, and maze of underground tombs around Thebes. As they pored over 19th century maps, Weeks and his team realised one tomb was missing. It had literally been lost. But Weeks soon round that early explorers had overlooked faint faces or evidence which showed the tomb to be a find of stunning importance. His find made headlineg around the world. Actual phygical evidence of who was buried in KV-5 came late. Arter cutting through vast sectiong of the tomb, Weeks and his workerg began sirting the debrig. Buried near the entrance was the tomb'g greatest prise. It wat here in this pit that we Found the human remaint of an individual I belive could well be the firstborn son of the pharaon Ramases II a young man named Amun-Her-Khepechet. He and 3 of his brothers were all interred in this tomb. One of them it still here even today. Now Weeks has secured permission from the Egyptian authorities to clean and examine the skulls. The data will be used to scientirically compare the skull to that of his probable father Rameses. With the latest in reconstruction techniques both faces will be brought back to lite. Then forensics will be used to uncover how old he was when he died and what caused the large hole on the side of his head. Can forensic analysis of this skull unlock secrets that will cast new light on the story of the Exodus? Is this the firstborn son that it referred to in the story of the Exodus? To find out Weeks is working with investigative reporter Charlie Sennott. He's trying to get to the bottom or the mystery or the Exodus and the death of Amun-Her-Khepecher. While Weeks probes the mygteries of KV-5, Sennott seeks the truth behind the Exodus story and its link to the skull of KV-5. It's an assignment that will take him to the remote peaks or Mount Sinai. to forgotten tombs in the pyramid fields. From the river Nile to Rameses' long-lost capital, Sennott will crisscross the greatest landmarks or ancient Egypt. For both Sennott and Weeks, Rameses' mummy is the crucial clue to the riddle or the son's death. Was he struck down during the Exodus? ln the Biblical story, it is the death or the firstborn sons that finally forces the pharaon to set the Hebrews free, arter generations or bondage in Egypt. Led by Moses, one or the most enigmatic figures in the Bible, his guidance on the long trip out or Egypt to a promised land is amongst the most famous of all Biblical stories. The Exodut it to Judaism what the Crucifixion it to Chrittianity. It's the formative, most powerful, most central event in all of Jewish history. A story that continues to have enduring significance not jugt for Judaism and Christianity but, also Islam. The holy story of Moses and argument against tyranny against oppression, all of this is part and parcel of our belivers system. But gome experts doubt it took place under Rameses is it took place at all. I don't think the Exodut happened in the way it is descibed in the book ot Exodus. The picture that archaeology provides is a completely negative picture. But just because evidence is missing doesn't mean the Exodus didn't happen. We mustn't be stupid and look for evidence that never existed. All sorst of thingt took place in the ancient world we've no evidence that at all. It's an investigation that will delve deep into ancient history and the Bible. Pitting hard questions against long-held assumptions. Was Moses a lost Hebrew baby or a rebel Egyptian prince? Was Egypt struck by 10 plagues? Was the parting or the Red Sea a miracle or a mistranslation? Was Rameses' firstborn gon struck down not by the hand or God, but the hand of man? In the sprawling depths of tomb KV-5, Weeks found what could be the oldest link to the Exodus story. A faint inscription held the clue. The first thing we saw was a wall that had a series of columns of hieroglyphic text and these text give the names and the title of the firstborn son of Rameses II Amen-her-Khepecher, whom is shown he's hit head. Amen-her-Khepechef is walking into the tomb following hit father Rameses II to be introduced to the Gods in the next life. Now this made the tomb particularly interesting, obviously. But the tomb closely guarded its secrets. We had to slither on our belliet across the rough sharp limestone chipt, between them and the badly damaged ceiling to get inside. We wanted to see where it went. Arter 6 seasons or painstakingly excavating what Weeks' still believed was a relatively small tomb, he made an astonighing digcovery. We thought this was gonna be a very small chamber I looked to my left and I could see a wall, the flathlight reflect off it. I look to my right and I could see a wall the flathlight reflect of it, but when l push my light down it doesn't bounce of anything. It just goes on and on in tunnel darkness. Clearly this was not a small chamber. At the end or this tunnel, Weeks discovered the guardian and builder or the tomb. This is Rameses II as the god Osiris. The quintessential God of the afterworld. Looking out back down this hallway to the burial places of his many sons. Weeks and his team had uncovered a vast labyrinth, the largest tomb ever buiIt in the Valley of the Kings. KV-5 lookt like an octopus with a 16 pillares hole for its body and then tentacles going out in every direction, not just on a single level, but on 3, even 4 different levels. It is unlike any other tomb that it known to have been dug in ancient times. It was a feat that would have required years or toil. Rameses' workers constructed a tomb of more than a 120 corridors and chambers. Inscriptiong suggest that up to 20 of Rameses' sons were eventually mummified and interred here joining their brother Amun-Her-Khepcher and watched over by their father Rameses for all eternity. One or thoge sons was Amun-Her-Khepcher and the digcovery or what ig believed to be his skull is perhaps the single greatest find yet made in KV-5. Can forensics link these bones to the biblical story or Exodus? A story whose authenticity is questioned by some or archaeology'g leading academics. We can describe it at beyond recovey. Maybe there it something there in the story, tome sort ot core or nucleus of truth in the very remote past, but I can asure you... the picture that archaeology providet it a completely negative picture. Why can't archaeology provide evidence of such a major event? The simple answer is, because the Egyptians left no recordg or it. But why would they not record such a major event? The answer may lie at Karnak. More than a thousand years in the making, it's the largest temple complex ever built. Alongside the deeds of the pharaons, Rameses recorded his greatest victory: the Battle or Kadesh. The battle scenes that we have from ancient Egypt come to out from the outer wault of temples, they were carved here for a very serious religiout purpose Rameses had to say I am the greatett king of all and it was the greatest victory that I am now bringing to you. And that is how specifically Kadesh was remembered. Exactly right. The greatest victory, of the greatest pharaon of the greatest county in the world. But the other side or Karnak holds another depiction of the battle of Kadesh. This time - a peace treaty. It tells a very dirrerent story. Why are there two very dirrerent versions of the same event? Is this evidence of an ancient cover-up? What really happened at Kadesh? Rameses has just become pharaon. Still in his early 20', both he and his dynasty are young. Both hold a fragile claim to the throne. They were nouveau, they were not related to the previout dynasties. They're not even married to them, there're no relation at all, and that meant they'd got to prove their worth. The best way to prove himself: in battle. Near the Syrian city of Kadesh, Rameses faces Egypt'g old enemy - the Hittites. But far from home, the young king is lured into a trap. He was determined to go and conquer this town because it's a key site, and then a couple of spies were captured, oh the Hittite King scared stif of you, he's miles away, These of course were planted by the Hittite King, a to trap him. At the royal camp, Rameses' queen and firstborn son await the outcome or the battle. If Rameses dies, so might they. For a General craving power, a vacant throne would be irresistible. Cut of from his main force, the young king is surrounded. Againgt hopeless odds, he stands and rights. Hours later, battered and bloody, Rameses returng to camp. While dressing her hugband's wounds, Nefertari hears his account or the battle. Amid cowardice and retreat, one goldier stepped forth to save Egypt: Rameses himself. He had a lot of courage because if you think of the Battle of Kadesh, anyone in his place would have lost the battle but he didn't. Rameses records the battle as one of Egypt's greatest victories. But the peace treaty shows Rameses' victory was at best a draw. That treaty wouId completey contradict the propaganda of the glorious victory that we saw on the other side. Exactly. So you have to wonder then, it this it one of those few instances when we can actually get a cIear document that can tell us the truth essentialy of what happened, that putt a pretty tough task ahead for us in termt of tying to look at Rameses and hit role in the Biblical Exodus. It certainly does, you've got your work cut out for you. A king who would disguide defeat as victory wouldn't publicise a humiliating slave revolt. We will never get an Egyptian record of the Exodus in a formal sente, ever. If we found evey stone block in Egypt, becaute that was not done. For Sennott, the conclusion ig clear. The Biblical Exodus was covered-up. But can Sennott get behind Rameses' propaganda machine and find out how Amun-Her-Khepegher really died? Amun-Her-Khepegher was raised into the deeply competitive world of Rameses' harem. First among princes. There mutt have been rivaly, jealousy, an awful lot of in-fighting l would have thought there certainly was a lot of ambition on the part of the women to have their own children pushed forward From birth, Amun-Her-Khepegher'g destiny was set. There had to be certain standards of behaviour that the child learned, there had to certain respontibilities prepared for. All with an idea of directing him into what was perceived at his future role at Commander of the Army and at pharaon. The firstborn son was groomed for the throne by his mother - Oueen Nefertari. Nefertari was the first great royal wife of Rameses II so, she was effectively the Queen of Egypt. Who the was, what her background was, is a bit more of a mystery. Rameses' inscriptiong say she was a beauty beyond compare. One lives just to hear her voice. Yet Rameses chose Nefertari for more than her looks. The roll of the great royal wife it perhaps twofold. One, she is a female countemplay of the King and second, she it the woman who's going to produce the next heir to the throne. The heir she produced never took the throne. To probe his death, the team in KV-5 is joined by Dr. Caroline Wilkinson. A forensic anthropologist and leading expert in facial reconstruction techniques, she will oversee the task or recreating Amun-Her-Khepegher'g face and identifying the skull. To make a virtual model or the skull Dr. Wilkinson will use hi-regolution digital photography. But first, with her colleague Caroline Needham, Dr. Wilkinson must asses the skull's condition and identify its pieces. It's actually more sturdy than l thought it would be Yeah, they are in exellent condition. (?) The breakt are ancient Yeah, and it's quite thick boned too. l think all of this can be put back together. The mount of... I can taste. (?) The mandible, or jaw-bone, is iugt one key fragment of evidence that will help open a window on the 3000-year-old skull. We have a complete mandible. Yeah, it make it all. - It make it all. (?) We have a few cervical vectebca, a few fragments of the face Yeah, lookt like we're just missing a bit around one eye. Wilkinson and Needham now begin the risky business or cleaning the skull. Professor Weeks ig all-too-aware that one slip could destroy a 3000 year-old legacy. A legacy being explored 1000 miles away in the Cairo Museum by Charlie Sennott. He's searching for evidence of the ancient Hebrews. Did they even exigt at the time or Rameses? On a massive granite block is a clue an inscription celebrating a victory over them by Rameses' succssor the pharaon Merenptah. Thit it the only mention of the Israelitet in all the Egyptian text. This it the only mention of the Israelitet in all the Egyptian text. In Egypt. - Yeah. - That's interesting. And we're referring here to the Israeli people not the land of Israel? Yeah, no, no, just the people. For Sennott the Merenptah Stele is a key find. It doesn't prove the Exodus happened. But it confirms the Hebrews lived in the time or Rameses making an Exodus possible. The Victory styra mentions the word Israel. If they had been the Israelit that left Egypt they would have left then before Merenptah and that would be Rameses II time. Searching ror supporting evidence is investigative journaligt Charlie Sennott. He's travelling from Cairo to the Nile delta, on the trail or a lost city called Pi-Rameses. A city named arter the man who ordered it built. The place where Amun-Her-Khepegher would have grown up. According to the Bible it was here that the Hebrewg were forced into servitude to build the greatest of the many monuments and temples Rameses was building all over Egypt. Pi-Rameses was the jewel in the crown. Therefore they did get over them taskmasters to aflict them with burdens. And they built for pharaon treasure cities, Pithom and Rameses. Although Rameses' city is named in the Bible; for centuries it was lost considered nothing more than a myth. But arter 20 years of excavation, the myth has been found. It's foundations lie hidden several feet beneath lush farmland. Egyptologist Ted Brock shows Sennott a tantalising glimpse or the city's former glory These colosal feet of Rameses are all that it left the rest is all buried below the fieldt. With a skyline dominated by huge temples and Rameses' vast magisterial palace complete with its own royal Zoo... Pi-Rameses was a thriving metropolis. And it contained a key find supporting the description or the city in the Exodus a massive chariot base. For Sennott it's another clue because according to the Bible Pi-Rameses was a base for 600 chariotg that pursued the Hebrewg as they fled Egypt. As time and the Nile bypassed the city, Pi-Rameses became a ghost town. Fragmentg or the city that the ancient Hebrewg are said to have built now lie nearby outside the modern-day town of Tanis. Moved there by later pharaons who recycled the stones. They were thought to be imbued with tome sort of power... because they belong to time of earlier rulers. So, they offen incorporate to the old buidings some ancient magical power (?) ...to the structure. (?) It was... (?) And among these magical stones are imageg of Rameses' children further evidence that Amun-Her-Khepegher grew up in Pi-Rameses. Here too stand statues of the great pharaon himself. So we know we have Pi-Rameses here. We know Pi-Rameses is mentioned in the BibIe. Are we getting closer we're doing to narrowing down this at the setting d'you think? If you accept the idea that Rameses was the pharaon of the Exodus yeaah, this wouId be the site ot al ot the drama that's detcribed in a chapter the Bible. The Bible says that the Hebrews had once been honoured guests in Egypt, but the pharaon turned on them. He ordered a cull - an event called the massacre of the innocents. It was a desperate measure motivated by his fear that their growing numberg would allow them to take over his country. Is it be a son, then he shall kill him: but if it be a daughter, then she shall live... This massacre was to set the scene for one or the Bible's most iconic stories. A story that is true would link a Hebrew baby to a pharaon'g son. It was in a desperate efort to save her son from the slaughter that a young Hebrew woman hid Moses in the bull rughes of the Nile. Hoping he might be carried to safety. Not far from Pi-Rameses on the banks of the River Nile- Ctharlie Sennott takes stock or this famous Biblical story. Thit it the kind of place where you can imagine the Moses story beginning: Moses mother lowering a batket here in a tributay of the Nile, and that batket Floating out into the river, down towards Pi-Rameses and then setting the stage for the beginning of the Exodus story. But some experts believe the Moses story borrows from other myths. The unknown hero it nothing new in ancient history and we have many examplet of a foundling child who rises to become the hero of that nation. But was the character or Moses really a Hebrew? Perhaps he was really an Egyptian prince? Moses at yet it untfaceable historically. He could be an Egyptian, the name ''Mose'' it an Egyptian name, he could also be a conflation of many different legends and stories. Could there have been a real Moses behind the many stories? I don't think that there it a way to say there was a Moses or there had never been a Moses. How can I say, maybe yes, maybe not. Though tantalisingly beyond the reach or history, trying to guess who Moses really was retaing an irresistible fascination. If he did exit he wouId have been very learned, very intelligent, very wise Egyptian prince. I like to think of him in tuch terms. Moses origins remain shrouded in mystery. Was he raised in Pi-Rameses as the Bible suggests? If so, he would have been only one among the many princeg whose father was Rameses. First and foremost was Amun-Her-Khepegher Rameses' firstborn son by Nefertari- and a child Moses may have known and been brought up with. Like Amun-Her-Khepegher, Moses was raised as an Egyptian prince, but according to the Bible, Moses has to flee from Egypt because he killg a man. He spied an Egyptian smiting a Hebrew, one or his brethren. And he looked this way and that, and when he saw there was no man, he slew the Egyptian... But word or the murder reached pharaon. Gripped by fear, Moses goes where no one will follow: the desert. Moses wanderg for many days. Finally arriving in the distant land or Midian, now Sinai. Here, he becomeg a shepherd. Putting his old life as an Egyptian prince behind him, he marrieg and has two children. According to the Bible, Moses spendg the next 40 years in Midian leading a simple life. Then one day Moses' world is utterly transformed. ''And the angel or the lord appeared unto him in flame of fire out or the midst or a bush; and he looked and behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed.'' From the burning bush comeg the voice or God: I will send thee unto pharaon, that thou mayegt bring forth my people the children or Israel out or Egypt. Moses' life would never be the same again. The burning buth tymbolised to Moses that he was in the pretence of God and that he was being asked to step out of the role of ordinay human being and instead act for God in leading his people out of captivity. The encounter with the burning bush was to set the whole Exodus in motion. As a retuIt of that encounter Moses takes on his mission and the Jewish people begin the Exodus from slavey to freedom. Reluctant though Moses was to accept God'g charge, he could not abandon the Hebrewg to their rate. And go began one or the greatest eventg or the Bible an event that brought down plagueg upon Egypt and ig believed to have led to the untimely death or Amun-Her-Khepegher. But where did this famous encounter with the burning bush happen? An extraordinary piece or evidence gtill exigtg to mark the very place. tharlie Sennott hag traveled to the monagtery or St. tatherine'g. It lieg in the ghadow or Mount Sinai in what was the ancient kingdom or Midian. BuiIt by Roman thrigtiang in the 6th century AD, the monagtery hag been a reruge ror pilgrimg ror 1 500 yearg. _hit it the wocId't oIdett Chrittian monattey, they came here at the time of the Roman pertecutiont of the Chrittiant. They Fled into the wildernett to etcape the pertecutiont exactly the tame way Moses had come the detert Fled the pharaon. And they were drawn here according to the recordg, by the pregence or an ancient bush. There are a lot of people myteIF included who would have a hard time believing that this it the tame buth that Moses taw. It that the real burning buth? l tell people it entert hittoy in the 4th centuy. But people have atked it it phytically pottible to have a buth exitting that many centuriet and they have conFirmed that it it becaute a buth will conttantly be renewing itteIF and itt own root ttock. A buth it vey diFFerent From a tree. like much in the Moses story, even ir gcience can provide an explanation ror the burning bush'g longevity, identirying ir it truly was here that God and Moses rirgt gpoke, is a matter or faith. tharlie Sennott returng to tairo to continue his invegtigation into the Amun-Her-Khepegher'g death. He's looking for what might have motivated Moses' rebellion againgt the pharaon. tould he have been ingpired not by the burning bush, but by a religion rounded in Egypt? l think it't vey interetting that thece't evidence ot tome tocm ot monotheitm in ancient Egypt around this time it we Iook at the OId _ettament and the book ot Pcovecbt we Find a lot of material that it cIeacIy dcawn tcom Egyptian touccet. Akhenaten'g revolutionary new religion worghipped one gupreme being the Aten, or gun-digc. ln honour or this all-powerlul god, Akhenaten buiIt a new 'holy' city in the remote region or El Armana. Within it Akhenaten congtructed a vagt temple dedicated to One God. And itg gi1e and layout are Robert Feather'g rirgt evidence that the religion or the ancient Hebrewg and that or Akhenaten were gomehow connected. While in Armana, Akhenaten lived in virtual igolation from the regt or Egypt. And with his beautirul wire Nerertiti and his famous heir, rutankhamun he concentrated his time on artigtic purguitg. Akhenaten'g most important work gtill gurviveg ingcribed on a tomb wall within the ruing or the city. One or the most moving or all Egyptian poemg it'g called the Hymn to the Aten. And incredibly these wordg are echoed in the Bible, in Pgalm 1 04. But the exact link between Atenigm and the early Hebrew raith remaing obgcure. Almost nothing remaing or Armana today it was abandoned goon arter Akhenaten'g death. Akhenaten died a railure his nation bankrupt, his religion degpiged, his people divided. Hig gucceggorg branded him a heretic, and wrote him out or history. And the man most regpongible was Rameses the Great. I It wat Rameses II who more than any other king ?????? and tat deJiberateJy to deface monumentt, to change the nature of the religiout ttructure of the prietthood, and to ty and tteer back to where it had been, prior to the coming of Akhenaten. But could knowledge or this religion have gurvived? Thit didn't all die in Egypt. The impact went right into the theology of Egypt how they believed in God. Seeking proor that Atenigm gurvived Akhenaten and triggered the Exodus, Feather getg orr with Sennott to a new digcovery: It's the tomb or a hish priegt or the Aten. located in Saqqara iugt outgide tairo hundredg or mileg from Armana itg exigtence proveg Akhenaten'g religion was rar more widegpread than many previougly believed and could have ingpired Moses to rebel againgt Rameses. Sennott wantg to explore a poggible motive that empowered the rebellioug Egyptian prince, Moses, to rige up againgt Rameses and lead an upriging or Hebrew slaves. Moses' believes in one God would have come into direct conflict with Rameses' plans to erase all memory or Akhenaten. The Bible recounts that after God revealed himself to Moses in the burning bush, he ordered him to return to Egypt and rree the Hebrew slaves. From Hebrew roundling to Egyptian prince to exiled murderer, Moses had come rull circle: back to the pharaon'g court. the gtage was get ror a conrrontation like no other in Egyptian history with Moses cagt ag the leader or the Hebrew people. So Moses conrronted the pharaon demanding his people'g releage. pharaon was unmoved. So to demongtrate the power or his God, Moses cagt down his gtarr trangrorming it into a gnake. the pharaon regponded by ordering his hish priegtg to do the game. But the contegt was ghort-lived. Moses' gnake gwirtly devoured itg opponentg. the pharaon was unimpregged. He didn't let Moses' people go. He would live to regret it. ro punigh the pharaon ror his deriance God unleaghed 1 O deadly plagueg to ravage the land or Egypt. It's an awFul thing to think about. With all the tuFFering of the Egyptiant, the Jewt are commanded not to reioice over the tuFFering. Biblical gcholarg have long gought an explanation ror the 1 O plagueg Sennott now invegtigateg a theory baged on the Nile River.

But the locugtg are driven out by the 9th plague: the hot dry windg or the 'Khamgin', the geagonal gandgtormg that begin in April.

But one plague derieg a scientiric explanation. the lagt and most deadly plague or all: the death or the firstborn sons. ln the Bible the Hebrewg are ingtructed by God to paint lamb'g blood on their doorg go that the angel or death will pagg-over them without taking lire rhis gaith the lord, at the hour or midnight l will go out into the midgt or Egypt. And all or the firstborn in the Iand or Egypt ghall die And there ghall be a great cry throughout the land guch ag there was never like it, nor ghall be like it ever more. tan this dreadrul night or death be explained by gcience? Mogt expertg agree that the chain reaction get orr by an inundation or the Nile cannot explain how the firstborn sons or Egypt perighed. tan the skull in KV-5 be one or the victimg? Having meagured the other skullg in KV-5 ror gigng or gimilarity to Rameses, Dr. taroline Wilkinson returng to the skull believed to belong to Amun-Her-Khepegher. And to what Weeks believes is the most intriguing agpect or his rind: a hole in the gide or his skull. Thit it what Fatcinatet me - this wound. Can you tell whether this wat cauted before death or aFter death? Well my initial imprettion it that this it not a pott-mortem wound; that it't at the time of or before death. Do you think it could have been the caute of death? PottibIy, but this tn't my area of expertite to l like to take our imaget, meaturementt back to a colleague and contuIt with her. What will the data reveal? Dr. taroline Wilkinson now beging work on recongtructing his face and the face or Rameses himgelr the man believed to be his father. We ute Facial reconttruction primarily for forentic identiFicationt So when the police Find a body that they can't identiFy by the utual channeIt they'll get a reconttruction done and that'll go out to the public in the hope that tomeone will recognite the individual and that will lead to identiFication. Wilkinson's reconstruction techniques are hishly regarded. We have about a 700/o eucceee rate with recognition and identiFication. While ghe rebuildg the face, the data ghe'g gathered will be girted by a forensic anthropologist, to angwer two key quegtiong: How old was the boy at death and how did he die? Back in Egypt, gearching ror clueg to Amun-her -khepegher'g poggible involvement in the Exodus ig tharlie Sennott. He hag travelled to the incredible remple or Abu Simbel, in the rar gouth or Egypt.

So you can tee here written and pictorial evidence ot Amun hec-khepethet. for Sennott it'g a revelation. Biblical historiang have alwayg aggumed the pharaon'g firstborn was gtruck down ag a child.

So happily in the 3Ot l would tay more than anything. for generationg Biblical tradition and Hollywood have ugually aggumed the firstborn gon killed in the 1 Oth plague was a child. J Ir this ig his skull thoge traditiong mugt be wrong. From forensic analysis to the ingcriptiong at Abu Simbel, the evidence gayg Amun-Her-Khepegher reached aduIthood. lr go, a migging chapter or his lire now can be written When Rameses had reigned ror 30 yearg he joined a gelect group that included only a handrul or Egypt'g longegt lived pharaong. By tradition, in year thirty or his reign, Rameses threw a iubilee called a Sed Fegtival and turned a king into a god. All hail Rameses The Sed Fettival wat a magical, religiout, re-aFFirmation of the ttrength and powec and pcowett ot a king. It wat utually held once evey genecation. Only halr way through what would be a 67 year reign, Rameses had already eclipged all but the greatest pharaong in his achievementg. He had brought peace; maintained Egypt'g borderg and buiIt great monumentg acrogg the empire. Hig country was more progperoug and powerlul than it had been in nearly a century. It's extremely important that the power of the king be kept Freth, tolid, strong. And the Sed fettivaI wat one way ot entucing that hit relationthip with the godt and hit relationthip with the people, continued to be at strong and wholetome at pottible. By becoming a god, Rameses dramatically changed not jugt his role ag ruler or Egypt but the role or his firstborn gon. And ag commander-in-chier or the army and heir apparent, Amun-Her-Khepegher became errective ruler or Egypt. He was pharaon in all but name. A God doetn't go out and cut ribbont at the opening of a building or adiudicate in legal catet, or tettle ditputantt' claimt or what have you. Therefore there had to be in eFFect a tecular King, tomeone who could deaI with the more mundane royal activitiet. The mott logical candidate wat the heir apparent, the Crown Prince, who in eFFect became _tittant pharaon. Religioug tradition ugually placeg the Exodus between Yearg 20 and 30 or Rameses' reign. While a pharaon became a god, and his gon became a ruler, an exiled prince returned to Egypt, a man who belived in one god: Moses. He's got weaIth and power and attett. He's a tocce to be ceckoned with. He's got the ability to take the entlaved Hebrewt out of Egypt. Hig opportunity may have come in digagter: a terrible rlood or the Nile. Plague rollowed plague Againgt each, mighty pharaon was powerlegg. Degperate to end Egypt'g long nightmare, Rameses ordered Moses to take his people and go. Rameses was awed by the God or Moses. Perhapg his gon was not. ln his father'g gupergtitiong, Amun-Her-Khepegher may have geen an old man'g weaknegg. the trown Prince began plotting to haIt the exodug unaware his gcheme would trigger his own death. the Bible tellg that arter the death or his firstborn gon at the hand or God, the pharaon relented releageg the Hebrewg from slavery. led by the ageing Moses they begin their journey into the wildernegg. But unknown to the Hebrewg the pharaon changeg his mind. And from the city or Pi-Rameses chariotg pour rorth geeking vengeance ror the pharaon. the pharaon the chariotg cloge in, to maggacre the rleeing Hebrewg on the bankg or the Red Sea. What happened next ig one or the most gpectacular or all the wonderg degcribed in the holy bookg or Judaigm, thrigtianity and Iglam... A pillar or rire gent from the heaveng. And it came to pagg the lORD looked through the pillar or rire and or the cloud, and troubled the hogt or the Egyptiang. Hig path blocked by gmoke and rire, the pharaon and his army grind to a haIt. rrapped and ungure how long the barrier will hold, the Hebrewg panic. then Moses gtepg rorth and prayg ror deliverance. Are there other clueg in the Biblical story about jugt who purgued the Hebrewg to the Red Sea? ''And Moses gtretched out his hand over the gea; and the lord caused the gea to go back by a gtrong eagt wind'' the Koran recordg the game miracle. Strike the gea with your gtarr. So it ig cloven agunder, each part like a huge mound. Ouickly, Moses orderg the Hebrewg to pagg through the parted waterg. And the children or Igrael went into the midgt or the gea upon dry ground: and the waterg were a wall or water unto them on their right hand, and on their lert. Ag the lagt or them reach the rar coagt, the pillar or rire digappearg and the Egyptian chariotg continue their deadly purguit. A purguit the Bible gayg endg in digagter. And the waterg covered the hogt or pharaon that came into the gea arter them there remained not go much ag one or them. It's doubtrul either Rameses or his eventual gucceggor Merenptah perighed in the Red Sea. Both geem to have died or old age. Sennott hag eliminated the two traditional gugpectg from the invegtigation. But a new gugpect hag appeared in their place. Ag Acting pharaon, could it be that Amun-Her-Khepegher perighed in the Red Sea? the skull believed to be his found by Kent Weeks is undergoing final analysis. It's fate now rests with forensic anthropologist professor Sugan Black. More used to modern police work than ancient archaeology, Black has nevertheless found evidence or how Amun-Her-Khepegher died. Could he have died during the parting or the Red Sea? What will the hole on the side or the skull reveal? It's not pre-mortem injury because there it no evidence of it showing healing, to it either hat to have occurred peri-mortem, around the time of death, or after death. So, l'm very happy to consider this a peri mortem injury. What would kill an Egyptian prince? Speed, for one. ln Egypt, the chariot was the equivalent of a fast motorbike or an MG, with two really strong horses up in front you could go 'whooth' across the parade ground and if you hit anything, oh boy... At 25 miles an hour an Egyptian chariot could be lethal. So when the impact occurred onto to here, then what would happened is the bone would have fractured around the position of that impact, and to it dents inwards. Another potential 'death scenario' could have emerged in the harem. A fate that berell one or Rameses' successors. There is a very famout story of a conspiracy hatched out by princsset of the harem to kill Rameses III we have the documents that tell us this story and therefore we know there was rivaly. Could Amun-Her-Khepegher have been a victim or assssination? It's a Fairly well-contained area and that't not going to be vey dittimilar to the thape of the implement that would have cauted it. the third 'gcenario' ig death in battle. Heir to the throne, Amun-Her-Khepegher was algo the tommander-in-thier or Egypt'g armieg. Since Amen-hec-khepethet it the one ton of Rameses II who wat consistently and most clearly associated with army life then all likelihood he wat done in on the Field of battle. Did Amun-Her-Khepegher die on the rield or battle from a blow to the head? It's the part of the skull that pretentt the clotett to the one mott likely to be hit. the impact likely caused tiny rractureg, ripping open delicate blood veggelg at the back or the skull - cauging death. 7he bIood wiII start to oore out, it won't do it at great force, but it will continually leak away and thece it no cepaicing that ????? and that may be a pottible caute of death. By that gcenario, the pharaon'g gon bled to death from a blow to the back or the head and not by drowning in the Red Sea. Doeg that mean there'g no link between his death and the Exodus? The Fact that Amen-her-khepetheF iF that it who it it wat out Fighting a battle, doetn't teII ut where the battIe wat, when the battle - well it telIt ut a bit of when the battle wat, hit age at death, but it doetn't teII ut who he wat Fighting. rravelling to the Red Sea, iournaligt tharlie Sennott geekg a link between the skull and what really trangpired when the Hebrewg rled Egypt. He needg to congtruct an aIternate gcenario ror the Exodus and challenge rour age-old migconceptiong. An ancient migtranglation ig the rirgt. ln Fact the Red Sea it not the Red Sea. In Hebcew it it Yam Sut. And Yam SuF meant literally Sea of Reedt. the gecond migconception ig the number or people Moses led out or Egypt ugually interpreted ag 600,OOO people. Another migtranglation. The quettion of how many actually people IeFt Egypt it clearly vey uncertain, but hittorical reconttructiont tuggett the number initially leaving Egypt may have been relatively tmall - in the thoutandt. the third twigt: Sennott'g invegtigation guggegt, Moses ????????? an 80-year-old prophet but a much younger prince a rebellioug gon or Rameses. And this leadg to the rourth migconception that the Hebrewg were derencelegg slaves. He comet out armed. The Old Tettament tayt he comet out in a 'mixed company' with armed people. lr 600,OOO were actually a rew thougand and many or them were armed what really happened? the most likely location for the Reed Sea is the marshlandg of eastern Egypt. these marghlandg lie on the route the Hebrewg were believed to have taken and orrer Sennott a new picture or the famous crogging or the Red Sea. lF the Reed Sea wat one of thete marthland areat, then you can really start to wonder. That maybe the parting of the Sea wat actually more like a marthland which would have been vey treacherout terrain for a chariot. And you tay the ?????? Iacgec quettion It it pottible that Rameses' oldett ton it not killed by the hand of God at a Bible tell ut oc pottibIe by the hand ot man? A living god above the concerng or the everyday world, Rameses would not have led the chariotg purguing the Hebrewg ag ig orten aggumed. The Exodut narrative it vey ttraight, the pharaon tent hit chariott, he didn't go himteIF, he wat above that tort of thing, l don't chate tlavet Far more likely the chariotg that purgued the Hebrewg were led by Egypt'g tommander-in-thier and heir to the throne Amun-Her-Khepegher. tould Amun-Her-Khepegher have Ied his rorceg into the Reed Sea only for the fleeing Hebrews to lure them into an ambush? Trapped in marshland and unable to manoeuvre chariots would have been easy prey for several thousand armed slaves. Slaves who took vengeance on their former masters by killing every last one of them even the man who would be pharaon. Perhaps the famous 10th plague the smiting of the firstborns sons was a metaphor used by the writers or the Bible to recount the death or Rameses' gon at the Reed Sea. Was the hand of God actually the hand or men who believed in God? Whatever the truth, the death or Amun-Her-Khepegher would have been a body blow for the ageing Rameses. Hig firstborn son his heir the effective ruler or his empire the general or his armies the son or his beloved Nefertari was dead. To send him into the afterlire, Rameses buiIt the vast tomb found by Kent Weeks. But are the gkeletal remaing round there related to Rameses? How do the recreated faces believed to be Amun-Her-Khepegher and his brotherg compare with the x-rayg or the man thought to be their father? lg their a ramily regemblance? Dr. taroline Wilkinson and her colleague taroline Needham have recreated 2d modelg or three or the skullg from KV-5. they call the skull believed to be Amun-Her-Khepegher 'skull 2'. Now they compare the skulls for similarities with Rameses. We can see very similar horisontal proportions between skulls 1 , 4 and Rameses. The centre of the eyes, the edges of the nose, corners of the mouth. But the most interesting thing I think is ..?.. spaces is when you look at the vertical proportions which that these 3 faces are startlingly similar. Exactly the same position for the eyes, the nose, the mouth, the length of the chin. Except for skull 2, which it much shorter from his nose to his chin. But having taid that they've all got vey timilar morphology vey timilar Featuret to their Facet timilar notet, timilar long thin Facet, similar long skulls in profile they do look like their of a type certainly. Not a certainty - but a hish gtatigtical probability. rhree skullg: one ramily. Rameses' ramily. ldentirying Amun-Her-Khepegher ig cloger than ever. It's the strongest evidence yet that the remains in tomb KV-5 are those or Rameses' sons. Having only partial inrormation about the skull believed to be Amun-her-khepgher's, Dr. Wilkinson utilises a team led by Anand Kapour. They're experienced graphic artists used to recreating 3d faces from damaged skulls. But how will his face compare with that or Rameses and will it finally bring Ken closer to solving the mystery. The 3d modelg have now arrived from Dr. Wilkinson. At last they gaze upon the faces or the man believed to be Amen-Her-Khepegher and the pharaon Rameses. Ok this it the probably that Caroline't given ut. This is the man. He's a father stern Iooking fellow itn't he? Yeah, he is. Certainly the most obvious thing is that he looks nothing like the classical depictiont of the pharaon. That's to be understood because Egyptian art was an idealising art, it wat not meant to be portraiture. Rameses would never have been shown as an asing, balding man he would always have been thown in the prime of his life. This is a human being. that's what makes it to interesting to see the man coming out from the image of the pharaon. But what do Weeks and Sennott make of the face that may belong to Rameses' firstborn son? l'm not uted to looking membert of the Ramittide court Jike this, I'm uted to tee them carved or painted on temple walIt. It certainly interetting to Finally tee the man who we've been Iooking toc It's hard to define emotions at this point. But certainly we're looking at 2 individuals who have a strong resemblance to each other. Course the only test would be DNA testing. That would be the clinikal but at this point we're not, we're not ready for that yet. These are the faces or Egypt's greatest king and perhaps the son who never inherited his father's throne. But did these two men really play a maior part in the Biblical story or the Exodus? Perhaps the truth still lies hidden in the labyrinth of KV-5 in some chamber yet to be unexplored. One of the thingt l would really like to know it what it the total extent of this tomb? How many chambert are there? How uItimately was the tomb designed? Why did they go off in all these different directions, breaking evey known rule of tomb design in the process? ln the 67th year of his reign, near age 90, Rameses the Great died. It was the end of an era. He has outlived many or 150 children and 200 wives, and left touching memorials to them all over Egypt especially to his beloved first Queen Nefertari. Ten more pharaong would take the name or Rameses in his honour, but none would equal his greatness. Like any pharaon, his defeats went unrecorded. And among them perhaps was a slave rebellion led by one or his own sons, named Moses. A rebellion opposed to the death by another son: Rameses' firstborn: Amun-Her-Khepegher the pharaon who never was struck down not by God perhaps but in God's name.
