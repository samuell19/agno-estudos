Lieutenant talvitie, please explain what an assault gun is. Us laymen probably confuse it with a tank. The casemate of the assault gun does not move. The infantry operates - near the assault guns, protecting the flanks. Senior sergeant borje brotell has commanded one- and he is experienced with anti-tank defence. Tell us. The commander must observe the terrain carefully- and aim as quickly as possible. If there is a tank, then just fire away. The karelian isthmus fall back! Us boys just keep going upstream. The russkies have advanced a lot since we are seeing our own troops. We'll have to hide ourselves and our gear fast. I wouldn't want to be in your shoes. Just hang in there, boys. You too. Lets go in to the forest. General sir, colonel puroma is on the line. 3:50 p. M. General lagus' command post, kuuterselka hello, puroma. It's lagus. Detachment puroma launches a counter-attack at 10.45 p. M. The vt-line will be taken back along the liikola - kuuterselka road. Which jaeger battalions you chose? Hynninen's 3rd and leppanen's 4th. One sturm company provides support. Hynninen leads the forward troops. Okay. Who is taking point? It is kvikant's armoured battalion's turn... - Good. It is settled. Over and out. Over and put, general. Lagus is one tough man. What happened this time? His own son, olof, is a gunner in the sturm company. First time in battle. - I thought he only liked chasing butterflies? The general fears accusations of favouritism if he is soft on him. 10:45 p. M. The counter-attack of the armoured division Well, lagus, you'll get your baptism of fire soon. Kaho, are you sure the grenades are ok? We'll load them faster than you can shoot. No need tp panic, boys. Let's just trust each other. Attention! Charge! On the double! Medic! Hasto! Wait for the medic! A russki tank at nine o'clock! Firel that's what I'm talking about! More tanks! Firel Firel A sotka tank at eleven o'clock! Drive forward! Good! Firel sartio! A shell got stuck! Goddamn! To the side of the road! Leka, this is nineteen. Four tanks destroyed. The gun is jammed. Four tanks in thirty seconds, lagus. I haven't seen anything like that, even on the German front. We did it together. I was just shooting. Don't be modest, ole. It was a world record. You remember when â€œfour eyes" came here, lieutenant. The army accepts any man who does his duty. Damned barrel! The angle of elevation is jammed. Kvikant, what happened? -Huh? What happened? The tank was destroyed and the crew injured. Well, well. We have to get across the field although our losses are horrible. It may be even worse in the west. I wonder if their lines will hold? God damn! -You take it easy for a minute! Taponen as gunner. Pirttinen will drive! The gun's elevation is jammed, captain. Are we supposed to shoot birds now? Kvikant, give me a break. A sotka at one o'clock. Drive down the bank so I can aim the gun. Good! At least our tank works like this. Orders to fall back. The Russians have broken through in the west. I am ordering general oesch to command the troops in the isthmus. We need to strengthen our defences. If anyone can do it, he can, field marshal. He's sensible, with nerves of steel. Losing the vtline was a setback. What does the general recommend? Could our defences hold at the old mannerheim line? I doubt it, sir. That line was completely wiped out by the Russians in the winter war. And the troops from aunus will not make it there in time. I propose that we fend off the enemy, at the earliest- at the viipuri - kuparsaari - taipale line. Are you serious, general? Retreating so far? Hasn't the vkt-line been fortified at all? -No, sir. But there, Finland's fate will be decided. Well, I do trust your judgement, general - but we have to put a stop to the enemy advancement. We lost a lot of good men. Yes, and we will lose more. We'll see if we can recover. We will see. Our troops will thin out before dying out. The engineers are on the move. They'll paint a swastika on the side and fix the caterpillar tracks. Increasing Finland's tank strength by one, yet again. Lieutenant, are there swastikas on the tanks because of Hitler? Bollocks. We used it first. Hitler stole it from us, and made the cross crooked. My father told me. The great Russian tank break through, portinhoikka There's a Russian armoured brigade - to the north of talinmylly. They're making us encircle them again. How long do they think that we old men can go on? We lost our edge long ago. You still have those kuuterselka traces on your face. They're nothing. Have you heard from home? They are still hanging in there. Back there the situation is a little of this and a little of that. Soon we will all be home. Yes, if by no other means - than in a pine box paid for the state. I'll see to it that the men are fed. They fight better with a full stomach. -True. Eerp... we will get through this. We've been in tough spots before. Would the major like some? The pea soup is good. There's still time. Boys, we have crisp bread! Fill up your have sacks. You boys eat well. Eero. What took so long? We have new orders. 3rd jaeger battalion will attack the front line through portinhoikka- to the tali brook - and take back what was lost in the morning. Understood. Hynninen's troops will advance on the left side and we will go here. So lets go, boys! Detachment leppanen! Forward! Goddamn! Medic! Charge over that Ridge! Give them hell! Damn, this isn't working. Fall back to the edge of the forest! Eero. Is there anything that can be done? Eero, eero, can you hear me? Tell them, jouko, not to carry me. Carry those who have hope. Thanks, that was a tight spot. Well, you would've managed it even without me. Captain hetemaki from the 50th, major, sir. No need for formalities. Jouko hynninen, 3rd jaeger battalion. You'll get a leave if we ever get out of here. Hasto. Major, the offensive continues. -Yes. I'll just make sure my gun is working. Vanya's tanks have broken through portinhoikka. Lets go and destroy them and then come back to rest. How many are there, major, sir? Enough. The russkies can't touch us. Teppo's sotka takes point. Virtanen. Slow down before the bend. Right. It's one of our own! No, it's Russian. Virtanen, drive on point. - 0k. Major, there are sotka tanks around that bend. They have aimed their guns at the bend. We have to retreat, major. Is that so... Shoot that man! Just shout that again, damn you! Get a medic here at once! The kv-1 tank takes point! Forward! Kv-1 to the rear, sotka on point. Full speed ahead. Dear god, please help us. Stop, virtanen. Teppo, virtanen and I will go forward. We'll check put that junction. Something is burning. Alright then. 5:30 p. M. Portinhoikka junction Virtanen. - Yes? We two tank sergeants just carried out the general's order. We took back the strategically important portinhoikka junction. The sotka on point seems intact. True. I'll see if I can start it up. Hop on. We'll drive back like kings. Virtanen, take cover! Russian tanks! Lehvaslaiho. I found American tinned meat. - Christ. Major, we saw no Russian infantry - but tanks, some intact. We saw none of our troops. Take the sotka to secure the junction. Aim your gun towards tali and the vyborg road. -Yes, sir. To the tanks, on the double! I'm hungry. Look at this, fellas. This says usa and it's full of buffalo meat. We fill our bellies with a western hairy beast. -Thanks, America. Thanks, Roosevelt. -And thanks, Russian tank crew, for running away. Open it up, and we'll taste it. We'll have to move soon. The sotka will take point with the kv-1 securing the rear. The kv-1 was left behind. Out of grenades! Out of fuel! Goddamn! A piled-up charge! Hold it! Lehvaslaiho is hit and the russkies are swarming us. -Help is coming. The wounded must be evacuated! Medics, bring the stretcher! Reino. Command post of the Swedish volunteers two miles north of the tali parish village Two men to unload. Welcome. -Hello. Lieutenant osmo mustakallip. I command the first independent anti-tank battalion. We sure need tank destroyers. Well, we're in this together. This is a very simple weapon. You hold it like this. Place the barrel under your arm and aim like this. Remove the pin. Raise the sight up like this. The sight rail goes to the middle hole and the edge of the projectile. The weapon is launched by pushing this button. This lump here goes off like a rocket. Simultaneously, a deadly flame shoots from the rear. Remember that. Arse fire kills. What did he say? Sounds bad. All of tali is being bombarded. Our 3rd battalion is there. That's right. There's no doubt about it. The line has been breached. Laxen. Roger that. Over. Our battalion returns to talinmylly to take back the defence line. Company! Fall back! Form a front to the road! Stop! Take up positions! Take cover! Hey! Not against the chest! They're retreating! Captain vaino mikkola, commander of the 1st assault gun company. Lars laxen. We were ordered to counter-attack talinmylly. Have you heard any engine noise? Not for a while. We'll see you soon. On the road. Well, now you can show your mettle again, son of lagus. Help! Help! Help! Medic! Medic! Is it bad? I can't feel anything. Don't worry, that won't kill you. You're too young. Understood. Over and out. Radio reconnaissance said the enemy's 30th armoured brigade is in a hedgehog defence north of talinmylly. The offensive may fail. That's a risk I have to take. I don't like this, orvar. Well, what's the matter now? It is too quiet. Like the russkies have vanished. They're out there. The Finnish counter-attack talinmylly What the hell are they doing? They have at least 20 sotkas there. Help! General lagus' command post general, I reached colonel bjorkman. Lagus here. Did laxen's attack succeed? It failed, general. There was heavy resistance. -Casualties? We lost two sturms and vaino mikkola. I'l be damned. Hey, sven. One more question. Do you know about my son? Olof was wounded. Nothing serious. He's in the field hospital. He'll be fine. Thank you, sven. Over and put. Over and out. Contact laxen. Return to your initial positions and hold them. Yes, colonel. - Qver. Hold on, stotis. A bullet hit your lungs but you'll be ok. We are being surrounded! We are being surrounded! Fallback! Fallback! Fallback! The captain ordered to fall back! Fallback! Did you see bjorklund and lindelow? For fuck's sake. They were left at the guard post. You go on. I'll try to find them. Bjorklund? It's great to see you. Who is he? - We don't know. He's a Finn. He was lying injured in the bushes. Good that you took him with you. Let's go. We're in a hurry. We are the last to leave tali. We'll head straight east through the marsh. Movement at one o'clock. Thank you. We don't know who they are. If we veered too early to the west they could be Russians. Boys! They're our troops! They're our troops! Second lieutenant, come here! Major sir. Take their submachine guns. They're needed in the front line. -Yes, sir. Your platoon will do fortification work at the old lhantala graveyard. Yes, sir. -The rest of the battalion continues to pyorakangas. Give me your submachine gun and clips, private. Major's orders. Do it, or I'll take them. You'll be back soon. As corpses or you'll come through the forest. Ivan has been wicked before. We'll see how wicked he is here. You'll do with a rifle in the rear. Major-general einar vihma's 6th division, lhantala Detachment, halt! Ok, you northern jaegers, we'll stay here. Put the machineguns and rapid-fire rifles in place. To shoot crossfire across the clearing to the foreground. You'll know. I'll come and see. Put your helmets on. Birds are not the only things flying around here. Hey, vorssi. Here the heroic dead end up in hallowed ground. You shouldn't dig deeper than six feet- or ghosts will start haunting us. Why are you curling your lips, savukoski? My brother was killed. I guess you're not joking around anymore. My five brothers are on the front too. Of course the youngest is the first one to die. He was eighteen, he had no experience in the field. I'm sorry for your loss. Every body's time will be up eventually. Now, let those spades fly, boys. We will lose in tali. That is a fact. Encircling them failed. Lagus, the status of your troops? The armoured brigade is fine but the jaeger brigade's losses are heavy. I've lost 2,000 men, both casualties and wounded. Now your troops can rest. Vihma, you'll take charge. The front will be moved here and it must be held. When will your troops arrive? The forward troops arrived already. The 12th jaeger regiment is ready to take charge today. The 35th regiment and 16th separate battalion within a few days. Alright. I will proceed immediately to dog round reconnaissance. Einar... if your troops are in a really tight spot- my tanks can provide support fire. Everything is up to your troops now. I know. But at least I have extra fire power from the rear. Thank you, Ruben. Tack. A reconnaissance patrol The russkies supplies seem never-ending. They seem to be increasing rather than decreasing. -True. Has kusti sent today's information? I think it's been decoded already. Well, these can be sent tomorrow. The Russians advance tali-lhantala road What the hell? Are the russkies already here? General. - Did you do all this? No, the corporal is responsible. Who are you? Corporal vaisanen, sir. We need more panzerfaust bazookas before they attack again. And we're really hungry, sir. None of us have eaten for over a day. Corporal, you will ride with me. The rest of you will secure the area. Lets drive back. Second lieutenant. Give the corporal some food. Get him some panzerfausts too. And a patrol up ahead needs provisions. -Yes, sir. Thank you, corporal. Keep up the good work. Thank you, general. Yet another example of what one elite soldier can do. The russkies would be here if he hadn't have stopped them. Lets go to the churchyard. Hello, Von essen. I brought more panzerfausts and panzerschreck grenades. Thank you, general. I need a couple of men here! 12:30 p. M. Finland's counter-attack lhantala Major... continue the attack. We need fire support. It's coming. Understood. Company, halt! Forward, boys! Forward! Heads down! The russkies are coming, take cover! Torstila fell. Damn! Let's see how he's doing. Medic! Company to the churchyard! Help! Take positions here, men! Well done, lieutenant. Thank you, sir. So here is the vkt-line. Doesn't look like much, but it is occupied. I can't hear anything! Hakkarainen, halt! Lieutenant, I can't take it anymore, I'll lose my mind. Care for a smoke? The gun powder smoke burns my lungs. Head down, hakkarainen. They're coming. Fall back behind the hill. Behind the hill! Hakkarainen, are you hurt? My thigh was hit. My leg is numb. We'll make a man out of you yet. They'll be here soon. I guess so. The old graveyard lhantala Damn, they're all empty! Let's check for russkies behind that rock. I'll cover you. Alright. It's clear! Your palm is lost. I'll take you to the first aid post. Thanks, heino. =you know... Lieutenant holmstrom's fire control reporting in, sir. You certainly took your time. -No one knew where the command post was. The Russian are attacking fiercely. The commander asks for support fire. Get the radio working quickly and contact the firing battery! Cub one, bear two. Come in. No contact, this is dead. Don't give up, boys. I'll arrange things in the rear. Everything's probably gone to hell there too! Damn, we need that support fire! The radio operator does what he can! Holsti, we've made contact. A fire command. Defence karkimo, fire! Defence karkimo, fire! That hit just the right spot. Carry on. The battalion is responsible for vanhatorppa clearing - this neck of forest in the middle and the big clearing next to it. The russkies usually attack across clearings. Barrage fire is to be directed there. Direct barrage fire on this neck of forest too, just in case. Sounds sensible. - I agree. What should we call the barrages? I suggest mekka. The neck of the forest is called mekka - the left side is mekka one and the right side is mekka two. With the command "all mekka, fire" all of them fire at the same time. Good. We'll proceed with this. What was your name again? Lars holmstrom, major. Lets go by first names. My name is antti. My friends call me holsti. We'll be off then. What's the situation? I have no ideal Damn it, miikki. I think the russkies are readying an assault. Yeah, order barrage fire. Radio operators, fire command. All mekka, fire! You guessed right. Our neighbours didn't get any further. This time. Have the russkies managed to pin point our fire control post? They have the equipment. We'll know after the next fire command. Listen, risto. We're going to be here for a long time without relief. You rest now. You'll lose your mind if you don't sleep occasionally. I'll go that way. Risto. Risto. It's your turn. What a dream I had. It was really quiet, without a soul anywhere. Leaves didn't even rustle in trees. That only happens in dreams. I'll come shortly. Ok, boys. What's the situation? I guess the russkies have to catch their breaths too. Put your pot on, kerkkainen. A small break, eh? You have to rest occasionally. Have you picked up a gun too, reverend? Anything can happen. You can't entrust every thing to the lord. What brought you to the front line, reverend? I was sent to ask for a fire observer to help the 35th. We heard you have two live ones. Risto miikki. He'll go, I'll stay here. Kerkkainen. Mekka two, fire. Mekka two, fire. Mekka two, fire! Goddamn! -The russkies will pinpoint our location soon. We should change locations. We can't! The commander asks for everything you've got. -All mekka, fire. All mekka, fire. All mekka, fire. Holsti, I heard an order for retreat for the entire division. This order is not from vihma's staff. Russians then? All mekka, fire. Once more. All mekka, fire. I'm badly hurt. Now you can get out of here. Got other first aid post. Rifle! Lets go. Haapanen, kerkkainen, that way. I'm alone now. I need a radio operator or I won't be able to fire. -Alright. Got the suurkari command post and report to them. -Yes, sir. I'm not doing so great either. That was my last orderly. I have exactly a dozen men at the line. Goddamn it all to hell! They've changed frequencies! Fall back, boys! Radio reconnaissance centre sortavala Get the hell out, every one of you! Hi. Anything unusual over the ether? Nothing much. Try to find new frequencies since you have the time. An adept radio telegrapher. Luckily comrade asks for repeats. Enter. Here is the intercepted message. They had changed the code. Really? - But not much. The message reads: "From the 30th armoured brigade to the 21st army corps." "Have received orders to attack lhantala." "Must be ready by July 3rd at 04:00 hours. "The infantry will try a rear attack in lhantala." Thank you, our, excellent work. I will deliver this immediately. To headquarters. Pesonius. What's the matter? We cracked Vanya's message. One battalion and the armoured brigade will attack at 4 a. M. They'll rear attack at ihantala, attempting to breakthrough. For once we have time for countermeasures. Over and out. Over and out. Message to vihma, the artillery commanders and the air force. 11:15 p. M. Lhantala Essen. The russkies are attacking at four a. M. I cannot take the chance with inexperienced men on the line. I must order your men back to their positions. Tell them I trust them. They will receive stronger support than ever before. Understood, general. Boys. I have bad news. Vihma ordered us back to the line. Damn it. The enemy is attacking in the morning. Service your weapons. When they come, we'll be ready. The general told me to tell you that this time we won't be alone. Have you heard anything? If they breakthrough, they can walk to Helsinki. Calm down. - Well, they can. Maybe. My wife is having a baby. What if the Russians get to Helsinki? Shut up already! You can guess. - What? What they will do to your child. And your mother and your missis. Quiet, damnit! Good! The onttola airfield come here, gentlemen. The whole flying regiment will begin bombing lhantala. Squadron kuhlmey begins with stukas and focke-wulfs. Then it's our turn. We will strike against the enemy at vakkila-lhantalan jarvi. Take these coordinates for your maps. The route will be familiar. Our junkers planes are first at 12,000 feet- then at two-minute intervals, the blenheims from 42ndand48th - and the dorniers from 46th, at descending altitudes. A full contingency of bombs, so we'll make an impact. The 34th will cover us. Our fly boys might be busy today. Our fleet of bombers is about 30 kilometres long. I'll call kuhlmey. The immola airfield Do we have to fly again? I told you so. Today. Hello. Where are we flying? Our heading is this and our target is this. Do we go further? Finland's freedom is at stake. Good luck. - Good luck. Headquarters of the 4th army corps lets see how damage is done. What damage, sir? If it starts hailing bullets like yesterday... -Stop it! You had better shave so your corpses will be pretty! -Don't! There's a dead women's auxiliary worker. -No! Yes! -=no! I'm sure of it. Eino, stay put! It's a girl! Someone, go and get him! Don't drag your feet! Our artillery fire will begin momentarily. We won't make it in time. We'll be in a tight spot. Lets go to that hill. I want to see how we kick the russkies arses. You're not afraid, bjorkman, are you? Lets go then. Load! Ready! -Ready! Battery. Fire. Attention. -Attention! Fire. -Firel attention. Fire! This is crazy, we can't make it there! You go on! I'll take an other look. Ready! -Attention. Fire! It's coming for us! It will pass. 21 batteries are firing. Almost 250 guns and mortars. I'll inform the commander-in-chief. Over and out. 4:55 a. M. Headquarters, mikkeli have you got information about the lhantala situation? I have good news. All attacks at the vihma section have been repelled. The last Russian attack was cut off already at the grouping area. I see. Thank you. The army is fighting again. The situation is under control. You had better rest now, field marshal. You may be right, general. Perhaps this is the best time. We have superb soldiers. True, field marshal. Goodnight, general. Good night. What's the situation now? You're not going to believe this. The russkies are with drawing their resources. - What? Do you hear that? There might be more coming. That's been loaded in a hurry. Damn. We have to report at once. Kusti. The russkies are retreating. What? Are you crazy? The railway line is full of equipment and troops. There, pass it on. Do you see anything?
