Last week I couldn't even convince you to look at it. What's that? The team searched the river again. It was stuck under a rock. It's not mine! What's in the Cayman's? What? Asher: Two airline tickets purchased this morning. One for you and one for Lexa. One way tickets to the Cayman Islands. I didn't buy it! They used your credit card. You killed Parker for the money. Brooklyn and Carson got suspicious. Carson threatened to call the police. So you killed Carson, is Brooklyn next? You've gotta be kidding me!? Do I look like I'm kidding? I heard what he said at the funeral. He was onto you. And I talked to Genna Koch. Who said that he didn't want the theft of your insurance money investigated. Gabrielle, with these two deats it's gonna be better for you in the long run if you confess. I didn't kill Carson and I didn't kill Parker. Why would I come to you about the damage to the life jacket? Someone is trying to set me up. W-Where was Brook when Carson was killed? I will answer that if you tell me what happened to Parker. I didn't kill my husband! I think we're done here! He's not dead. What? I saw him. I think he faked his death for the insurance money. Where did you see him? San Francisco. When? Your turn. Brooklyn ordered take-out from your house. The delivery boy confirmed that she was there around the same time as the murder. Can you think of anyone else to point to? I don't know. What? What are you about to say? Nothing. Gabrielle, I don't know who you're trying to protect but at this point, you are our prime suspect. You are our only suspect. You can be charged with murder one and if I find that you're connected to your husband's death, two counts. You'll post bond in the morning, don't leave town. And if you're guilty, Gabrielle, I'll prove it. And if I'm innocent? ♪ (door shuts) ♪ I almost want to believe her. Almost. She's good. Or she's telling the truth.

She's not going anywhere. (door slams) ♪ (sigh) ♪ (irritated sigh) Brooklyn? Look, I don't think you should be here. Why are you here? Brooklyn, can we talk? Look, w-when I got here, I-I don't know what happened. Carson was already unconscious and bleeding. How could you? Maybe Carson was right, he never really trusted you. Why did you have such a big insurance policy for Parker? You know that I-I knew nothing about the extra insurance. All that money is gone, I thought that Carson took it. Yeah. You told me. You made me believe your lies. I thought I could trust you. I thought you wanted to help me, not kill my husband! I would never kill... And with Carson gone now, you own the company. You've done quite well for yourself, Gabrielle. Don't come near me again, or I'll get a restraining order. This is-This is like a bad dream. It's like a nightmare. I keep expecting to wake up. And what is happening? Brooklyn says she's afraid of you. Does she have any reason to be afraid of you, Gabrielle? This stinks of a set up! What does your cop nose say? That you're not telling me everything. ♪ The man in the stairwell that night. He wasn't there to mug me. He said Parker had his money and he wanted it back. I didn't tell you the truth because he threatened to kill me and Lexa. I didn't know what it all meant. I just... It's why I told Genna not to call the police. Could identify him? Maybe. I think his name was Travis. I found evidence in Parker's files that he was making payments to him every week. Over two years, it totalled two million dollars. I think Travis is behind all of this. But if Parker was paying Travis, then why would Travis kill Carson. Because about a month before, before Parker disappeared the payments stopped and I need to look at Parker's work computers. Why? I don't know just to follow the money and prove that I'm innocent? No, I can't let you near those computers until you're cleared. You gotta stay away from Brooklyn, her house and Langston Financial.

Donna: He agrees that the damae was deliberately caused. The top of the tear seems precise, probably caused by a sharp knife, consistent with a box cutter, but the rest of the tear is ripped. He also notes that the person was right handed and had to have worn the jacket at the time. He figures it was a male as ripping the fabric takes considerable strength. So, Parker did fake his death. And wanted to make it look like an accident. Plus, if she wanted to kill her husband for his insurance mone, she would have claimed it as fast as she could. She didn't, she waited 2 months. That's the one thing he didn't count on. But then why is Parker is San Francisco, wouldn't he wanna be far away? Unless he's waiting for something. Or someone. Do me a favour, run a background check.
