RADIO BROADCASTER: It is now 7:00 and time for the news bulletin. The heavy fall of snow has continued today, heaviest in the Valais district from which almost the entire population was evacuated early this morning. The worst hit village in the canton was Urteli, from which a minor avalanche was reported last night. A second avalanche today caused considerably more damage. For some hours it was feared that the snow was to claim two victims in Urteli, Mr. Ernst Dion and his wife, Gretchen. However the Dions were reached an hour or two ago, injured, though not seriously, and taken to the nearest hospital at Lausanne. Mr. and Mrs. Dion, were anxious that the news of their rescue should be conveyed to their two children, Werner and Maria... -Where's Maria? -...now in transit at Bracken... -I don't know. - ...with their aunt, Miss Augusta Dion. Where is she? Where could she go? It's hopeless. Even the station staff at Urteli have been evacuated. They have been taken out with the last of the rescue party.
