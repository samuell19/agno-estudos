Akulova. - Here. Gubtsova. - Here. Yorzdnaja. - Here. Valentina Saar. - Here. To the gatehouse. Amrajeva. - Here. Valja! - Farewell, Valja! Valja, dear! Who will get you, such a clean girl?! Have some. - Thank you. I went to do geological survey work. - Exciting. Wanted to the see the North since childhood. And then got the chance. Have some more. - Thank you. Hold it, or it will fall! - What happened? Excuse me. Comrade superior! Give me the coat! Thank you, comrade superior. Look at that, you waited. I thought you'd be home by now. Three days, it's nothing. - For you, anything less than 5 years is nothing. Shame you can't lock the doors here. Where can you ever lock the doors? - Nowhere! Wait here. I give you 25 for a compartment. - No. - Fuck you! Listen to me carefully. My girlfriend is waiting. Look at me. You get 25 and I get a compartment key for a few hours. Are we clear? Come here. That's it? - That's it. All right then. Valja, come with me. What, for good? - Well, yes, for good. We'll get married. You're alone, I'm alone. These are our trumps. You know I'm not alone, I have a son. I have to find him. What are you on about? How old was he when you went to jail? Two or three, now he has not idea who you are. He's long forgotten you. - He'll get to know me. Use your brains, we'll start over, all anew. No, I can't, Roma. You truly are a fool. Go on, just go! See you. - Don't fret, Roma! Thanks for waiting for me. Valja, you damned fool. I've got four fools, you're the fifth! Stolen Meeting Script: Maria Zveryeva Director: Leida Laius Camera: Jüri Sillart Design: Toomas Hõrak Music: Lepo Sumera Cast: Welcome to Tallinn. Dear passengers, you were cared for by the Tallinn Wagon Depot brigade... We hope you had a pleasant journey and will again take our train. Here you go. - Thank you. Are you my mummy? - No. Mummy? - No. No, he wasn't brought back. And I can't give you any information about the child. - Is that so? Am I such a terrible criminal that my child has to be taken from me? We didn't take him from you, you yourself gave him up. You wrote the application to give him up? - I did. No one forced you back then? - No, but... - Well, there you are. From that moment on you have no rights to the child. See, she did finally turn up. What are you thinking, Soo? We've been looking everywhere for you. The boy is worried, won't move a step from the window. What's the point in looking for me. You shouldn't have. I reconsidered. - What? Well, I won't have him after all, he's deaf. Why are you staring? You didn't know, or what? We knew, but he is your child. He's deaf. - Oh well. Write an application to give him up. And what are you waiting for? - If I could see him even once. Thank god that your son was adopted by good people. No one will allow you to ruin your son's life because of your moods. Do you have no compassion at all? - Compassion? For you? I hate people like you. Have you seen our children upstairs? You haven't? Go and have a look. A year ago, I had one group of imbeciles, now I have three. Did she sign? - No, she did not. Said she's a single mother, so we're obliged to keep the boy here. Did Ruudi see her? - No. What should I do, where should I go? - Wherever you want. Who should I talk to? You are obligated to tell me that. The City Education Department, the child protection inspector. I wish you well. This is yours. Hey, commandant. Give me a single room. What? You're a handful... Find me a closet. I'm tired of people. I'd like to be alone. I know why you need a single room. To host men? What do you care? I'll pay. I'm not some young girl. That's good you're not a young girl. All right. For your blue eyes. Come after the evening bell. Why did you lock the door? Open up! What do you want? What do I want? Let's drink tea. I'm sleeping. Don't take me for a fool! You promised, so open up. I promised you a bottle. I'll buy it tomorrow. Stop being silly, open up! - Yeah, I'll come running. Hey, commandant! I'll shout and wake the whole house up. - Go on then! You fool, you damned fool. I've got four fools, you're the fifth! Militsiya! I'm being raped! You'll be moving out tomorrow! - Whatever, but today is mine. My boy is not like that. He is already regretting it. It is very hard for him there. Comrade Uibo is not here. Don't know. Don't worry, he'll be alright. He'll learn a profession. You'll see. At the colony? People are weird. He wanted to kill her, but she pleads for him. A grandchild. She was like a mother to him. Comrade Uibo is not here today. - But tomorrow? - Neither tomorrow. What kind of order is this: only comes when he feels like it? His mother is ill, dying. What do they care? Not a tiny bit! So when will he be in? - When he finds a nurse for his mother. I'll come speak to you then. - To me? Yes. Please help me. - How? Your issue is not in my work area. Besides, you gave the child up. Yes. I was convicted and decided to let good people adopt him. I was a fool. Thrice a fool. - I understand, but... I'd like to see him just once. And to know where he was taken. What are you saying? It's not allowed, not by law and not otherwise. And why not? I'd just take a look, that's all. And then nothing, ever again... Help me, I beg you. Put this away right now. Let me through! - No, I won't! Dear god. Valka! You? How so soon? "For good work and exemplary behaviour". Valka... Is this possible? So when did you get here? - On Monday. Why didn't you come to my place? Your things are all there. You're mad at me. - Milvi, don't hold up production. Damned stud. Hold on. Tonja, please let me go today. I'll make it up on Saturday. - Okay. Where are we going? You don't know? We got a new apartment, two rooms. We bought a new cupboard, a Czech make. Not as beautiful as yours was, of course, but... Forgive me. Milvi, we're not going to your place. - Why? Ants is away for two days. Your cupboard can wait. Let's go to a restaurant. Let's party. Ants doesn't drink at all, brings the whole salary home. - I see. But less about me, how are you doing? - Fine. You know I've always been lucky. Valka, wait. You're bound to meet him somewhere. He can help you. You don't know what he's like now. He can do everything. But I can't. You did the right thing when you left. I'll never forget that court hearing. You sitting there, pale as paper. Adjusting your collar all the time. - A button came off. That horrible git in glasses saying: "Deficiencies, deficiencies." And you kept fiddling with the collar. - I'd lost a button. I kept looking towards the door. Thinking that any minute now Lembit will come and set things right. But you didn't even glance towards the door. Did he go visit the boy? Did you? I did. He was taken away soon. I wrote to you. Not that you ever replied. I didn't read your letters. You are still mad at me, Valja. - Leave it. Everyone has their own life. I'll find him. Cosmonauts and dreamers both agree, that even Mars may have blooming apple trees. Since when is it so neglected? - The orphanage? I don't know. The collective combine's behind it. I haven't been here for so long. You know, I never tell people I'm from this orphanage here. Be careful to not let it slip to me. Dearest, don't you fret about me. The whole universe is open to us, see. Do you remember the intern? Why, of course I do. A shy one, blushing all the time. Oh, how stupid we were. - Exactly. Stupid as stupid can be. One, two, three, four, another day has gone by. I can't wait a moment more, tell me quando, quando, quando? Dear mother, please forgive me, that your daughter is a thief. She met a thief and loved a thief, the thief was caught and I was too. You know who can help you? Nadezda Petrovna. The Russian teacher?- Yes. She's got connections everywhere. Maybe you're right, she had power. This was also a very good class. My last one before retirement. After school, I worked at the factory. Then at the base. - A very good start. Katrin Kuusk also started at a factory, now works at the regional committee. Nadezda Petrovna, I ran into some trouble at the base. You know how they sent us out from the orphanage with nothing. Happiness is not in money, Valja. - Yes, if you have it. We didn't even have a spoon. 17 years old, we needed clothes. Clothes don't make a person. I did tell you about Chernychevsky. Yes, we remember. After school, I saw everything. That's how it really works: when it's three, you write down two. I felt sorry for myself. Why is it so hard for us? Oh Valja, your Russian has become so good! You need not fear hardship. Hardship makes you stronger. I've let myself babble away. I'll put the teapot on right away. Valja, tell me about yourself. Are you married? Any children? - A son. I came to ask your advice. Oh dear, I dropped it. A shame, it was a gift from Anna Turevitch. Never mind. You wanted to tell me something about yourself? Not much, I'm doing fine. I work as a senior product specialist. It was hard at first, but I managed, found some strength, and took the honest path. Very good. Married to a senior engineer, my son is straight-A student. Mummy... Mummy... Sleep, Jannu. Go back to sleep. Talking in his sleep. I couldn't have taken Jüri. Believe me, I truly couldn't. You know that Ants was against it. Didn't want to marry, the weasel. But I was already pregnant with Jannu. What could I do, tell me? Well, if you couldn't, you couldn't. Valja, don't be mad. But don't look for him. There's no point. You think he won't take to me? I'll give him such a life! You once already did. - What? You think I'd do it again? Never again! I'd rather die than break the law. I've learnt! No, I didn't mean that. - What then? I don't know. But nothing good would come of it. Now you listen to me. Half of my life is gone and I've got nothing! I've had nothing, no one - besides Jüri, only him. And we'll live together. I'll make my life into something you've never even seen. Valja, I'm sorry, Ants is coming today... Oh, please forgive me, doo-be-doo-be-doo... For there to be no doubts, here is my passport. Who would have any doubts, Milvi. I worked at a sewing factory for 10 years, now had to leave. - Why? Well, how should I put it? Chief technologist started hitting on me, brought gifts and such. I don't want to file complaints or make a big thing of it. But I can't take it either, I'm sure you understand. Yes, of course. Valter. - Milvi. Please. Mother, this is Milvi. Mother, this is Milvi. I'm about to go to work, mother. Right? Hello. Hello! - What are you standing there for? And put slippers on! You've made the whole floor dirty... You can't just jump the queue! You were not standing here. - What do you mean? I certainly was. Excuse me, was I standing here? - Yes, she was. You were standing there, but not her. - Perhaps she was? - No! Well, well! Welcome. You're looking good. Well done. So talk to me. You come back and then disappear. Come and sit. - Thanks, but I've sat enough. All right, let's stand. Let's drive somewhere for dinner? I'm free until morning. The family's at the summer house... You know, you're starting to go bald. Why haven't you come by? I've found you a decent job. We'll sort out an apartment for you. I don't like to be indebted. - Why are you worrying? If I didn't turn you in back then, I'll do it even less now. Valja, don't be a fool. Have you even thought how you're going to live? Do as you like. Best not regret it later. Oh hell... I wonder if I'm even getting my medicine today? What are you standing there for? Have you got nothing to do? Damn it, I've had enough! Drop dead, you witch! Who are you looking for? Can you tell me which room Valentina Saar lives in? Who are you to her? - What? Just that your Saar is a damnable con artist. Found a job, moved in and that's it, hasn't been seen since. Perhaps she left something to be handed over? She didn't leave anything? - She stole something from you, yes? Why do you think that? - It's obvious what she is like. Go talk to the militsiya. - No, no! May I? - Go ahead. - Thank you. Don't tell my mother. - Of course not. I heard you had trouble with her. Don't get mad at her - she is old. Oh, we're used to hardship. At the orphanage, they always said no matter, Valka, you can take it. How many? - Why? What do you mean, why? - Why Valka? They called me that, they didn't like Milvi. Two. Well, and they gave her 8 years, for nothing. But she's actually a nice girl, that friend of mine. They don't give 8 years for nothing. - Well, not entirely for nothing. Her hands were not clean either. - She started stealing? Basically yes, but you do need to live. And then she fell in love with the manager. Then she had a baby. She wanted her son to have a life like normal people. I don't know, normal people do it differently. You would not have done that. What, me? Oh, less about me. When she went to jail, she wrote an application to give up her child. It is rare, because that's when people hold on to their child. - Exactly. The lawyer also told her: "Hold on to him, he is your trump." But she decided to give the child up. What was she supposed to do? Hide behind the child's back? So her son would sit in an orphanage all her years in jail? Damn it! She must have loved her child very much then. Jesus... - No, I'll go. But we'll talk more about your friend. - Of course, we have time. Good night. Good night. What is the value of the contents? - It's a passport, a friend left it. 30 kopecks. Oh, hello! You don't recognise me? I worked at the orphanage. You asked me for auntie Marta. Yes... Hello. Sirje, was it? I really didn't recognise you. I came to work here. Oh, I found out one of our nurses actually knows Marta's address. Halloo. Sergei, is that you? Thank you. - You know very well, after six. Sit down. Sit down! What do you need? - In what sense? The most direct sense. You want to get married? Why do you think that? I don't want anything. I'm just doing my job and that's all. - That's not all. I've been watching you for a while. - Oh yes? And what am I doing then? You're not exactly the one I would have wished for my son. But you never know. He had no luck with the previous ones, they were all sluts. Don't worry, I haven't even thought about anything like that. But what are you thinking? You wouldn't suffer me otherwise. You think I don't see it? Perhaps I'm a sectarian or a Seventh Day Baptist. All right, a Baptist... Don't tell me if you don't want to. But he likes you. I have noticed. And I guess I like you too. Only you lie a lot. Milvi! Milvi! Milvi! Milvi, what's wrong? I posted your passport, didn't you get it? Valter! Call Valter. Run! Call Valter... Let's see if comrade Uibo will drink tea with us or again go home. Mother got worse. Hello. - Hello. I wanted to tell you that I'm very grateful to you. Although I see now why you did it. - They opened your eyes? - Yes. But I'm still very grateful to you. What was your real name? - Valja. I did it for that at first, but later I got to know you and your mother... Stop, Milvi... Valja. - Stop what? You think I like it? You think I don't want to live like you, everything is honest and nice? Where have I even seen such a life? At the dorm or in prison? In 30 years, I've had my own home for 6 months, when I was stealing. Believe me, I only did it for my son. - Of course. Maybe. All of that may be extremely unpleasant. It is not my place to judge you. But I can't help in your matter. - You can't? - I can't. There's another family there. People have got their life in order. Have you seen them? Can you at least hint? - No, I can't. It's not necessary. It wouldn't be fair. Oh, yeah... Here's your pay for your work. Go fuck yourself. Where are you going? Oh, you came back! What nerve! What do you say now? - Nothing. Need a private apartment again? Or perhaps a personal palace? - Stop it, I'm registered here. Then move to the 12th. - Will do. Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day... Lead us not into temptation and forgive us our debts, as we have also forgiven our debtors. God, help me. Hello, auntie Marta. Hello. Do you not recognise me? I am Valentina Saar. Do you really not recognise me? Valja Saar, remember? Do you really not remember? Do you not remember my son either? Jüri Saar, he was also at the orphanage. Go away, Valentina. I don' t need your money. You problem doesn't concern me. Your problems are your own fault. Go away, Valentina. Go away. Damned idiot, where are you going? You really wanted that? You were crazy already as a child. Are you sure she knows the address? Of course. But she won't tell you, she has an adoptive daughter. Just forget it, understand? I swore to her in the name of God. That's why she moved away, so no one could tell the girl. Try to recall. He was a doctor, a tall, presentable man. Can't remember. He even got you medicine? - I can't recall him. This one is called Kätlin. - Don't you say. Dear heavens, how pretty. - Ene, go to your room. Go on. Asta, have mercy on her. Every mother loves her child. Don't you think she's anything like that. After all, she was... She was my child. And you know me, I wouldn't have otherwise come. What is it that you want? You made a mess, spoilt the child's life, and now what? Oh, poor me, I'll drop my old habits, start a new life, is that it? I have already paid for everything. Oh yes? And now you want others to pay? And I should help you in that? No. Never. You hear me, never. - That's enough, give me the address. The address! Or else everyone finds out how you got your daughter. Well, the address! Or shall I call the girl? It won't take me a minute. Well? No, don't call her. No need. Hey, what's wrong? Was it any skin off her nose? I had no choice, you saw it. You won't find happiness through the unhappiness of others. Is it ever any other way? Have you seen so? Your ticket, please. - Inmate Saar. Your ticket, please. Here you are. - To Tartu? Yes, to my son. See you tonight, Sander. - Yes. Where did you get this one? - Traded with the boy next door. What did you trade it for? - For that small butterfly. This dragonfly is also new. - What's it called? What's it called? - The brown hawker. - All right. Now to bed. I don't want to. - Come now. - Go on, off to bed. Come on. Say good night to your father. - Good night. - Good night. What do you want? Hello, it's me. Ilmar! Hello. Yes, you guessed right, it's me. - Where are you going? I think we should first introduce ourselves. Valentina Saar. As you can see, I've come for my son. Of course, many thanks to you that he could live at your place. Live at our place? Do you understand what you're saying? - Tiina... Comrade Saar. Your desire to meet your son is probably quite natural, but... See, I'm a doctor, a paediatrician. Believe me, Jüri is a labile, unstable child. I beg you, please spare him. - Ilmar, how do you mean - meet? That's not possible. I won't allow it. - Oh, won't allow it? But I'll tell him anyway that you're his parents only on paper. He knows we're not his real parents. - Is that so? It is. We haven't hidden anything from him. On paper? Have you no shame? Why should I be ashamed? And why would you want a weird child? But maybe you simply don't know the facts. Who was his father? A chronic alcoholic. I have consumption, coughed blood during pregnancy. - Please stop. You're completely healthy. And your child is completely healthy. You know what, let's try to talk like human beings. You're a young woman. You can bear another child and... Ilmar, please. I want you to understand: his life with us is good. - Don't you say. No way I'm giving him to you. You no longer have the right. What right? Jüri is my son and I am his mother. And you can't fight that. Lady, please be so kind... Thank you. Why are you moping? Jüri, I so rarely get to be in the fresh air. I have to get out sometimes. - On a bus at 8 in the morning? Let's go to the movies after school? I'll buy the tickets and wait for you. Why? Why? You want everyone to laugh at me. Even 2nd grade girls are no longer taken to school. Not to even talk about boys. Let's get off here. - What's wrong? This is not our stop. Sander, is Jüri also... Jüri. - What is it? Our classes are over. Dear heavens, how big you are. Lady, what are you doing? Jüri, don't call me "lady". I'm your mother, your real mother. Mother? Real mother? - Yes. You came? - I came, Jüri, I came. Now all our troubles are over. How are you doing? - Alright, I guess. Are you into sports? - A little, I play tennis. You know, I played volleyball. You're good at it. - Really? But don't call me the polite "you". Do you not remember me at all? - No, I don't. How we went to the country? The cockerel attacked you, left a scar? This one? - Yes, this one. We are closed. Does Udo Tamm work here? - He does. - Could you get him, please? - Yes. Udo, dear! - Hello! You have put on some. - Yes, this is no orphanage food. Yours? I knew your mother when she was your age. With a shaven head. - You were the same. Please, do come in. I'm happy to serve you. So what would you like from here? Some chicken? You know, I took revenge on that cockerel for you. - How? I bought it from the neighbour and made a soup out of it. And I ate it? - Of course. Go on, eat now. You were a funny little boy. You even talked to pancakes. - How? I put a pancake on your plate, you poked it and said: "Hey, cake." Did I think it was alive? - Well, yes, round and yellow. Can I take a look around? - Of course, go on. Go on and play, if you can. The band will only come at night. Horses pull my carriage, while I am ride inside. I am a wealthy king, I own all the land. I have loyal servants... Awesome, Valja. - My middle name. When the enemy does come, they will instantly fall back, cause my soldiers will be there to meet the enemy. Then we'll have a merry party, and you'll have a party too. I am a wealthy king, I own all the land. What was that? I made this song myself. - Really? I'm a king in this song. I like to play the king. I performed a song at the orphanage when I was your age. I wish I was at home, when the apple trees bloom and their pinkish blossoms my hair so adorn. And their pinkish blossoms my hair so adorn. I wish I was at home, when the fields of rye are done and the brownish-yellow grain quietly rustles in wind. I was at an orphanage once, only I don't remember it. See what we're like. We're alike. - Yes, we are. But why were you gone for so long? I couldn't come. I thought about you all the time, but I couldn't come. You couldn't come? - No, I couldn't. - Why? I had to fulfil an important task far away in Nicaragua. What was the task? - We were fighting the plague. But my dad said we beat the plague. - He doesn't know. He's a doctor, he knows everything. - But there's still plague in Africa. But you said "Nicaragua". - So? - But that's in Central America. What did I say then? - You said "Africa". Again the polite "you"? Can't talk to your mother normally. And don't be such a stickler, eh? I made a mistake. Sit down and eat. What is it? - Nothing, you've got smudge here. Everything is alright. Let's race up the stairs, yes? So much snow, like real winter. It's slippery, I can't run any more. Have you been to the south? - Me? No, I haven't. - Me neither. Would you like to go? Let's catch a train and go, right now? I have a test on Thursday. - So? We'll be back in a week. How can we go, my mother will worry. - Your mother is here. I'm going to go now, all right? - Why, my son? You're with your mum. It's really time for me to go home, or at least phone them. No, you don't need to phone. I warned them, they know. Now let's go to Kids' World and buy you a present. What is it? I want to go home. - Why? They know you're coming with me for good. You want me for good? - Of course I want you for good. And my mother agreed? - Why are you acting like this now? Why are you harping on about phoning them? We'll get there and send a postcard. - I'm not going anywhere with you. Okay, okay. We'll phone. But I'll talk to them. You stand here, okay? You better stand over here. Why can't I talk to them? - It's such an important adult matter. I want to talk to mother myself. - First I talk, then you, got it? Hold this. Hello. Hello, it's me. Yes, everything is great, we'll be off soon. Yes. Yes, definitely. We'll write to you. Thank you. Yes, of course. He also sends his regards. Yes, I'll pass it on. Of course. Goodbye. Let's go now. - What did they say? They sent their regards and wished us a nice journey. And that was all? That was all. Come on now. Jüri! There's no one home. Well, there you go. They've gone to the cinema. - Not so quickly. You're lying to me. Listen to me now! - Let me go, I don't want this! Please forgive me, but I love you so much. Let's live together. Try even a little bit, I beg you. We'll be all right, you'll see. Don't decide right now. Let's just stop by the station, okay? I don't want to. - All right, let's go. Wait for me here. Sit here. Promise me you won't go anywhere. Promise ? - I promise. You won't betray me? I never lie. - Good boy. Attention, citizens, the train is about to depart. Please step back. Comrades, the train is about to depart, please step away from the wagons. We'll still go. - I'm not going anywhere. All right, we'll just buy a ticket. Please let me through. I'm with a child. - Oh, with a child! What are you saying?! Never mind, we'll think of something. Please let me through. Excuse me, I'm a mother with many children! Thank you. Help, my child has been stolen! Help, my child has been stolen! People, can you hear me? There she is. See, my child, that woman! Let me through! - Give me my child, that woman's taken her. I apologise comrades, I only took her for a minute. What kind of a person is that! - I know her, she sleeps here. Where did she get this one? - Stolen probably. Didn't have it before. It's all right, we'll check right now. Come here, boy. Let me go, you scum! Well, boy, who is this? It's my mother. Have you no shame? What will become of your son this way? Check her documents. - I needed the baby, we're going to a funeral. Grandpa died. - She's lying! - I'm not lying, why should I lie? We're late for the train, we need to get to a funeral. He can confirm. Tell them, go on. Did your grandpa truly die? Yes! Yes! Yes! Do we have to go now? Don't cry, Jüri. You know, I betrayed you. I'm not your mother. Yes, I just lied. Simply went and lied. But why? I was so alone and I so wanted to have a son like you. I learnt about the scar accidentally. What happens now? Can I now go home? Where? Oh, of course you can go home. Home... Goodbye. Would you like me to write to you? - No. I have no address. Go on now. Go. Translated by Kati Metsaots Subtitles by Mardisupp OÜ
