THE SPELL There is water all over. Honey, want to try? Try what? I say a word and you reply right after what comes to your mind. -Understand? -What's the reward? Reward? That will be a surprise. -Okay. -Ready? -Red. -Apple. -Blue. -Sea. -Cow. -Beef. -Rain? -Clouds. Fear? Gecko. Okay, again. Why are you so afraid of geckos? One more, okay? Dream? Moving back to my childhood home with you. Are you all right? I'm fine. Watch it, fool! This belongs to you now. Your parents would've been so proud that you returned to your family home. Thanks, Uncle. Cheta. Who is she? Cheta comes to clean this house. What happened to Sophorn? After your family moved to the city, Sophorn stopped coming here. This one came looking for work so I hired her. All the documents for farm lease are here. Thanks for all the arrangements. See you at the farm tomorrow. I'll be there. So pretty. Honey. You dropped some documents. Honey. Didn't you say no one lived in this house for last few years? Yes. Almost done with the lease. We are going to be the proud owners of a beautiful farm. I still think we should be more careful about putting all our savings in one place. Darling. I am doing all this for our future. Besides, I need to make enough for all the children we are going to be making. You want to make babies, right? Come on. What time is it? 7:30. It's still early. I think it's time for you to get up. Let's see if I blow in your ears again. No. I want to see those twitching toes again. Stop attacking your husband. Can't escape now. Let me help. Cheta, how did you get in? I tried calling out, but there was no answer. The gate was open, so I came in. Let me get the phone. Hi, honey. I was in the garden. With Cheta, the maid. That's not nice, don't be mean now. Did it go well at the farm? Glad to hear. See you soon. Bye. You scared me! What are you doing? I heard some strange sounds coming from here. There was also some water by the door. Where? Over there. The water was right here. I don't see it. I saw it right here, don't you believe me? Thida, it's late. Let's go back to bed. Come on. Let's go to the island someday. Let's go home. What's wrong? -Come, let's go. -Hey, what happened? There are some difficult memories from before. What do you mean? Let's go, I don't want to talk about it. Come on. Come on, let's get you out. Honey. Honey. Are you all right? Honey, I don't feel so good. Something bad is happening in this house. Hey, I grew up in this house with my family before moving to Phnom Penh. Nothing bad is happening here. It is all new to you here. Give yourself some time to settle in. Can you come home please? There was something in the pool. I couldn't breathe and I saw myself. Are you already in Phnom Penh? Can you please come back soon. I am scared. Darling. Why are you in the pool at this hour? Aren't you cold? Darling. Why don't you answer me? Darling. What are you doing here? Let's go inside, it is freezing. What were you doing here? What were you doing last night? What do you mean? Why were you in the pool in the middle of the night? What? What are you talking about? Look at me. I found you standing in the pool last night. I don't remember. I think I had a dream. Maybe I was sleepwalking. Used to happen to me as a kid. You never told me. Don't worry. Everything is fine. I haven't sleepwalked in a long time. It's getting late for your work. You don't want to be late. Food is ready, have it before you leave. I made some breakfast. Please hear me out. Please think about it. It's not up to you anymore. Make sure you clean up properly. You were born to make my life difficult! I'm trying to do some work. -Sorry, Uncle. -Get me the driver! Got the key, where do we go for a drive? Dumbass! I asked for screwdriver not go for a drive. I'm already late to meet the house owner. Thought we'd go for a drive. You have to stop this. Get these clothes away from me. This is not right. I know what I'm doing. Listen to me, you will achieve nothing from all this. Get out of here! I've missed you. You cannot replace my wife! There is no place in my heart for you anymore! Honey. Honey. Thida. Thida, can you hear me? I don't feel well. Everything will be all right. Come here. I am right here with you. Do you sleep well? I will make us some breakfast. Really? Do not worry. -Food is ready. -I'm almost finished. What a treat. Honey! Your nose. Honey! Honey! Honey! Honey! How is he, Doctor? He is not responding yet. We need to run a few more tests. Thank you. Honey. The blood flow to his brain has been interrupted and all of the movement is disabled. In rare cases, it comes back on its own if the blood flow resumes. Unfortunately there is no medical way to make it happen, and only time will heal. Can you hear me? Can you hear me? Thida, can Nak hear us? The doctor doesn't think so, but I know he can. Thida, without proper fencing the farm is losing its crop to stray cattle. And the pests feast on what's left. This is not what we imagined for the farm. The hospital bills and treatment for Nak was very expensive. He will be better soon, and-- It's not my fault that your husband becomes crippled. I got workers on the farm, and all I hear from everyone and everything is money, money, money. Crops are headed for a disaster, and I will not lose my share. I need you to make the payment that is due. Where are you going? Please wait. You know I cannot take your jewelry, Thida. This is not necessary. I cannot, you know, I can't. But if you insist, this will take care of the farm for now. I can surely make things work in the farm for now. I shall leave now, feel better, Nak. Cheta, what are you doing? You look beautiful in your photo. Who is she? She is my mother. She left us earlier this year. I still miss her every day. She isn't gone forever. She still watches over you. Who is there? What happened? I thought I heard someone walk by. There is no one here but us. How many spoons of sugar? What? Spoons of sugar, for coffee, for tea, I'll make some for you. Don't worry about it, I just want to rest. Honey, where are you? Honey! Honey! Honey! Honey! Honey, where are you? Honey! Where are you? Honey! Honey! Honey, what are you doing here? I think you and sir are in danger. I have seen things like this happen before. It could be a curse or some spirit casting its spell. The spell can only be the reason for your suffering. You should move back to the city. I think you and Sir are in danger. Honey! What happened? Are you all right? How did you fall from the chair? Honey. Honey. Honey. Talk to me, please. Please say you can hear me. Tell me you are here with me. Honey. Please say something. I want to know you can hear me. Just give me a sign that you are here with me. Say something. Please, just say anything. I need to know you can hear me! Please just give me a sign! Anything! I found something while cleaning the storage room. Many men forget the wrongful past for selfish future. Looks like your past was no different. Also, here is something that is supposed to be for you. Have a look. Look. Look over there. It's so pretty over there. Beautiful. Lin. What are you most afraid of? The thing that scares me most has something to do with you. If you ever leave me, I will go crazy and kill myself. Don't say that. I will only be gone for two or three years. We can still be together, but this will be good for our future. What future are you talking about? You say you love me, then how can you leave me? You and I are meant to be together forever. Don't you get it? -Lin, listen-- -I don't want to listen! I'm going abroad only for my studies and will be back. You lie! You don't even want to meet my mother. I don't believe you! Lin, listen to me. What about my work? How can I provide for us when we live together? Why do you have to go so far away for that? Please don't be like this. Try to understand. Are you still upset? I'm going for studies, but I will always be yours. Do you really mean that? You are not lying, right? No. Promise? You won't lie to me. Nak. I want you to know... that you are not allowed to separate from me. Do you get it? What do you mean? You and I are meant to be together forever. Stop it! You're crazy! We are finished! No! Come back! You promised! Promised not for this madness! No! Come back! I gave him the medicine already. Are you done cleaning the storage room? Yes, all cleaned. I'll go home now. Wait! What do you have in your hands? Nothing. Let me see. I found this while cleaning the storage room. You shouldn't look at it. Honey! Honey! Have you considered moving back to the city? Yes, but we are unable to do it at the moment. Most of our money is invested in the farm, and the remaining money was spent on his treatment. Do you mind if I have a look around the house? Please, go ahead. Thida, there are special spiritual masters who can be the only ones to help you. Will it help if we leave the house? It is too late for that. The spirit is already latched on to you, and its shadow is too strong. It doesn't want me here. There must be something you can do to help. It is beyond my abilities to stop the danger that lurks around you. I cannot help you. Nak, honey! Where are you? Nak! Cheta! Help me! Honey! Nak! I'll try the back door. Help me. Be careful. Honey, are you hurt? This won't stop, and you should leave this house. Honey. Are you all right? You can't stay in this house anymore. It is too dangerous for you here. She will not let you live in peace. What do you mean? The girl in the photos, that is my daughter, Lin. Her spirit shadows over you, and she is angry. Her love became her poison, and she wouldn't listen to anyone. Not even her own mother. Lin! Stop, you can't do this! Leave me alone! You don't know my pain! I don't want to live without him! Lin! Stop hurting yourself and others! Ma! Lin! I will not let you do this! Stop it! Lin! -Lin-- -I hate you! I let her suffer, and drove her away... when she needed me the most. She won't stop hurting him. If you want to save your husband, you have to leave this house. I am not going to let him suffer anymore. We will leave to the city tomorrow. Could I please stay here for the night? It's only a dead bat. I think the switch went off again. I will go fix it. Lin, please stop! Let her go. None of this is her fault. Please leave these people alone! Please stop! I will not let you hurt her. I should have been there for you when you needed me the most. I have lived with the pain of losing you. My everything collapsed and slipped away right in front of me. I failed you as a mother. I will never... let you down again. I will never abandon you again, and will be by your side forever. I will always love you. Mother.
