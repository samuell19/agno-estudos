School Board Fears Merger With Lincoln Vocational? - Morality Crisis Shatters Aloha High School. - Merger, wow. - What are you looking at? - School board President Hartlander announced today that it is with great reluctance we must face a possibility of a merger with Lincoln Vocational Bees. There's more. It may be the only way to halt Aloha's reign of terror. - Yeah, we know what's going on. - I'm not going to that chamber of horror. I don't care who we merge with. - Right on. - There's some bees over there. I've already merged. - We can't have that baby laugh, can we? - Check out Miss Black America. - No, more like Queen of the Jungle. Catwoman! - Oh! - Pray for the full moon, you guys! - Right on. - See you chickies later. - Bye. - Hi girls, fixing up? - Hi, Beam. - Hello, Beam. - Move over. You girls see the morning papers? - How's that? - What's that you're doing? - Powdering my nose. Can't have a shiny nose. - Oh yeah, I didn't know that. - Leslie, don't waste water. You don't have an ecology-minded bone in your body. What is that? - Oh, hi, Leslie. Ms. Beam. - High protein breakfast? - My mom's too busy to cook. - Boner, get out of here! This is the girls' room! - See you girls for lunch. - Bye, Boner. - Dinner. - Boner's got a heart as big as all outdoors! - All right, I've had enough! Let's go, while you girls are still around. - Can I borrow your powder, Beam? Can't have shiny tits. - Leslie, that's a pink card. Come with me. - Leave me alone! - Beam. - Fuck off! - Why I declare! - Nurse Beam, please report to Dr. Ivory's office immediately. Nurse Beam, on the double. Aloha High School, good morning. - Morning, Ms. Watson. - Oh, I'm sorry, sir. The principal can't possibly talk to you now. Well, gee, I'd like to slip you in, but Dr. Ivory is preparing the menu for the week. - A subtle sauce can turn simple fare into a festive dish. Let's begin. Sift two cups of flour. - Whew! - Be careful. Gently add eight egg whites and using twice as much butter as flour. - Heather, drop what you're doing. Separate the two eggs. - Into what? - Into what? Ah. - Remember, the well-beaten whites should be stiff, but still moist. - Yes! - Sorry to interrupt, Dr. Ivory, but it's Mr. Hartlander from the school board. - Oh? Put him on! - Well, how's the situation there, Ivory? Still learning children's sit policy? - Everything you taught me, sir. - Well, that's good, good, Ivory. Because an investigating committee from the state board of education's gonna drop in to take a firsthand look into this morality crisis situation. - The what? - The morality crisis situation, Ivory. Haven't you seen the papers? - Poppycock, poppycock! - Look, they're talking about this goddamn merger with Lincoln Vocational again. - Good. - Now listen, Ivory. I don't want any trouble. - Peel and chop two onions. - That's beautiful, Heather. You paint beautifully. - Ivory. - Thanks. I always enjoy being here, Dr. Ivory. - You're a good egg yourself. - Ivory? Ivory, are you listening to me? - Now the milk, the cow's milk to the cook! The white-- - Ivory. - Oh, we're out of milk, Dr. Ivory. - What do you mean you're out of milk? I mean, run out and get some. - Prior to the placing of the crisp souffle dish in the oven, remember to pour the milk. - Yes, what is it? - Doctor, Nurse Beam is here. Oh, and are my french fries ready? - Eyes working, and they're in! - And now the bird is ready for basting. Do not burst or break the turkey or fat will run from-- - Here's the alcohol, Dr. Ivory. Ready for your rubdown. - Good, good, but there's no time now. No time now, baby. - Dr. Ivory, nothing to worry about. Nothing. Your sample's negative. - Good, good, I feel great. - Ready the chicken. - Chicken coming up. Get the chicken, will you? - The turkey must be gently bathed and the rear cavity prepared to receive the chicken. - Not that, not that chicken. The oven! - Open the cognac. - Pour the cognac over the bird. Pour the cognac over the bird. Pour the cognac over the bird. Pour the cognac over the bird. Pour the cognac over the bird. Pour the cognac over the bird. Pour the cognac over the bird. Pour the cognac over the bird. - Hey Lilly, a tub of malted and two pizza burgers.

Hello? - Jordan. - I'll be right back, honest. - Hello, Jordan. - Oh, hello, Mrs. Watson. - I think I'm gonna live dangerously today and have a luscious banana split. - Yes, Ma'am, how would you like it? - I'll have it with buttered almond and pineapple coconut. - Yes, Ma'am. - Jordan, you're very nice. You're very handsome too. - Yes, ma'am. - My, it's good to see one young man working after school these days. - Yes, Ma'am. - You certainly seem to enjoy your work, Jordan. - Yes, Ma'am. - Most kids just squander their time away. When I was a girl, it was different. You had to work just to make ends meet. Do you know what I mean, Jordan? - Yes, Ma'am. - Oh, spread some more nuts, please. Oh, that split. It does look splendid. Jordan. Jordan! Oh, Jordan! Jordan. - Look what the warden let out. - Check out the bells from St. Mary's. - Yeah, and the bells got the clapper. - You girls forget your madam?

This is Mrs. Watson with today's social notes. The Yearbook Club will host a discussion of faulty erections within our cities. From his bedside at Camarillo Hospital, Dr. Ivory reports he loves you all and says to take special care when eating out. - Where's the State Ed? - Oh, they've already started, sir. They just went out the door a moment ago. - Right, good, good. Murray, Brennan and Malone, huh? Yes, who's in charge here, Ms. Watson? - Well, since we've lost Dr. Ivory, there's, it's just me. - Well, I'm sure you'll make an excellent guide. And now I want them to see the whole school. Anything they want to see. I'm anxious to see that report. Give them carte blanche, Mrs. Watson. Carte blanche. - Tres bien, sir. Nurse Beam, Luigi's truck is here. He wants to unload his hot meatballs. - Come on, come on. What is this stuff? This is gonna be good. Thank you, Lincoln. Hurry up, hurry up. - All right. A little tequila. - Wait, shit!

I mean, swish. - Boy, if Randy didn't wear those baggy shorts, you could really see it. - Yeah, I can really dig his bod, every lick. - Hmm. Lickety split. - Dig it. There's something about Brian's mouth between those shoulders. - Boy, am I loaded. - Hello, Jordan. Oh, we're in luck. Today's Thursday, spaghetti and meatballs. Luigi's meatballs and Nurse Beam's sauce. Delicious. - Hmm, let me see, I'll take two of these shells. And a pineapple or how about a peach. No, two peaches. - Only one dessert to a student, please. - Okay, look, here you have that one. And this one's mine, let's get out of here! Fix it up, man. - Shh! Shh! - Isn't it marvelous? - Hey, man. - Don't you think it's great? I could eat two tons of it. - The tour! Come on! - You're embarrassing me. - Oh, you're embarrassing me. - Barbara, I'm gonna turn you in. - Ah, look at that! Oh, far out. - Oh, that's disgusting! - That's disgusting. - Wait, wait, let's make a spaghetti man. Make a spaghetti man! Stop it, oh god! Wait, wait a minute, wait, wait! - This is starting to look really good. - Now instead of the good parts. - Here, smell this. Did you smell this? - No! No! - Hey, where are you going?

The State Board of Regents has been meeting on it since eight o'clock this morning. You tell Walt Hartlander that closure on moral grounds is a goddamn winner if I ever saw one. Those Aloha kids are playing into our hands without even that idiot Ivory. They'll move the students to Lincoln and put the building up for bid, and we snatch it for a song. Expect one hell of a fine headline in this afternoon's paper. I can have cost estimates on bulldozing the school by tomorrow. Goodbye! - We're on go, Walt. - Cheerleaders and basketball team, assemble on walk five for halftime show rehearsal! Attention students, Aloha High School would like to announce the arrival of our new principal, Mr. Hall Walker. He's here temporarily by special appointment of the State Board of Regents. Cigarettes out, zippers up. Let's give him a grand welcome! Oh, good, good, welcome. Welcome. Mr. Walker. - Hall-Walker. - Celia Beam. We're here to help you, sir. - We can start by policing this place up. - Yes, sir. - It's a mess. - Well, sort of. - Frankly, Mr. Walker, the school's a wreck. - Isn't there a custodian? - You're lucky there's someone here who can show you exactly what you want to see. I'm always available. - Nurse! Nurse, I need children! - He's gonna jump! - My life's a drag, I mean, what is this? Sex and dope every day? What happened to the school books? Where's the library? I'm gonna jump, you don't believe me! - Don't jump, you have so much to live for! - I'm gonna jump! - No, help! Help him! He's, he's, help him! - Mr. Walker. - Help him! - I'm tired of it! Goodbye, Mr. Chips. - I've heard so much about you. - No, no, help him! - Goodbye, cruel world! - Is there a Mrs. Walker? - Of course there's a Mrs. Walker, my mother. - What are you doing, you guys? Talk to him, help him! - Look out! I scared you, didn't I? - This is the way to your office, sir. - Oh shit, this tub's had it. - Here, try this fuel. - Yeah, what do we got to lose? - Go in the court, and stash the rest in the lockers. - Why aren't you in class? - I'm between periods, yuck-yuck! Har-har! - Pay no attention to them. Let me show you the language lab. - Excuse me, I gotta fix this car. - Ms. Watson, send the cheerleaders in. - Far out, man! Aloha, Mr. Walker. - Wow. - You wanted to see us, Walker? - I want you to account for your actions today. - Hang on, you guys! This place is out of state! Congratulations, Walker! - This must be a real break for you, Mr. Walker. - Yeah, he's got his office together. Maybe he can get his... - Right on for brother Walker! - Right on, right on, right on! - Brother Walker, right on! - Can we cut the crap right now! I'm told that you're exceptional cheerleaders. I believe it. I like winners, but I also like straight shooters. Now you like being cheerleaders, don't you? Well, starting tomorrow you will do your assignments like any other student. You will attend each and every one of your classes like every other student. You will do your homework like every other student. You will have the same status as every other student. And you will dress like every other student. You like being cheerleaders, don't you? As of right now, you're off, you're fired! You students may go. - Oh, don't worry, girls. Things will work out. I'll see what I can do. - I'd like to blow this whole fuckin' place up! And that marine with it! - Bunch of shit! - Tryouts will be held this afternoon to select new cheerleaders for the game tomorrow with Lincoln Vocational. - It's about time to kick ass. - Yeah! - Gail, hey, what's happening, mama? Ra-ra-we, we kick 'em in the knees! Ra-ra-rass, I kick 'em in the ass, whoo! - Silly clown! - Oh goddamn, Gail, sit down, listen! Look, this is Fred talking to you, goddamn it! You're not so bad, Captain! - For your information, bean head, we've been fired. - Well, that's too goddamn bad. - Is that the only way you can attract attention is acting a damn fool? Why don't you put on a monkey suit and do a little tap dance for him? Stupid ass. - You silly heifer, you. You know what? Now why don't I shake my thing and just turn you on? - You think you can? - Yeah, really. - How you know that turns me on? - It's common knowledge. - Hmm. - Hmm. - This is the man you're gonna have to deal with! You've put it down, you pick it up. All I wanna see is elbows and you know what. Come on, bend over, move it, move it, move it! I wanna see some movement around here. Come on, over there, over there!

Don't let that ball bounce, put it in the pile! I wanna some lines, quickly, quickly, quickly. And more quickly, more quickly! - That's nasty. I'm dying, I'm dying, it's all over. I've done it! - Pick it up. Now get to class. - Mr. Hartlander. - Oh, thank you. Who the hell is Hall Walker? What the hell's going on? - I told you, Daddy. Daddy! - I don't want state people all over the school. And I'm not taking part in any social experiment. - It happened in the school board, and you can't do anything. - I'll handle this. Those board members don't know who runs the real world. - Daddy, I want a-- - Pass the salt, please, won't you? Either I run the school or they run the school. You know, mergers aren't fools play. Joanne, I want you to do something for me at Aloha. - Thanks! Daddy, I know I can. - We can't have everything, buttercup, but we try. - My father says you can start as of right now. - Joanne, sweetheart, thank your father for me and tell him I'll be delighted to help him with anything that comes up. He's such a generous man. Brontosaurus! A giant herbivore of the Jurassic period! 30 tons, 1000 times as great as the baby alligator. This great beast has been extinct, dead to Man's glance for 100 million years. - Let's get out of here. - They built no great empires. Knew not of wisdom, had but two desires. Too large to mutate. - Wonder what it would be like to make it with one of these things. - Better make it a quickie 'cause we're all going to the game after the field trip. - Why go to the game? Who needs us anyway? Who cares? - Yeah, with that dildo running the school, who cares about us? - Come on, you guys. We're still cheerleaders for anyone that matters. - Cut the flattery shit, Leslie. - Hey, fuck you! - Fuck you too! You know you always have some bright comment to make. - Quit bitching. - Who's the bitch? - You, bitch! - Gail, you're a real bring down! - Well, just fuck you too! - Oh, cool out, you guys. - I wish I were in her pants. I would shit in them! - When we get to the game, we'll down her stuff. - Tell me what happened, I'd love to help out, but I've already got four pink cards. - Those mountains look pretty tempting. I think I'll join you. - I see you girls later. - Hi. - Ready, okay! - Open the window, roll out the mat! Come on, team, lay them flat! Yeah! - That's it, that's it, that's it! No!

Final score, Aloha 58, Lincoln 57. - Beam, you give me nightmares. Haven't you seen the papers? What the hell am I paying you for? - I did everything I could possibly do. It's those little girls, they run the whole school! Ooh, ooh, ooh! - Hold the pin, Beam. - Yes, sir! - Look, I can't afford to have Walker around any longer. Now, this merger's a simple deal. For God's sakes, let's close it. - Did you get that, Beam? - Yes, sir. - Look, there's really only one goal. To create a fine community in which to live. And to live in it. But damn it, this time it's for real! Now I want that land! I want the school closed, I want those people out, now! - Oh man, I don't believe this! Look at the school! Hot damn! Oh man, hey, they blew the school up, wow! Look out, it's early summer vacation! Hey, where's my geography book? Wait a minute, man. The school has been fucked! Look at this, wow! Hey man, anybody, what's happened? It's over, we can split! - Attention, student body. This is Mrs. Watson. Aloha High School has been condemned due to structural damage. Students will keep out. Our principal Hall Walker is missing and is alleged to be responsible for this malicious bombing. I am temporarily in charge. Pending criminal investigation by the state police, all Aloha jackets will turn into Lincoln. I mean, turn in your Lincoln Alohas to your Lincoln. Oh. - Hello, children. This is Walter Hartlander of the Board of Education. Now a terrible thing has happened, and I know that mergers are sad and difficult for us all, but this is a time for us to work together. We must be brave. Now, turn in all your Aloha jackets and uniforms to Mrs. Watson, and all the monitors will report immediately to the auditorium at Lincoln for orientation. That is all. Mrs. Watson, where do you keep the files? - Holy shit! Leslie, report to the principal's office immediately! Leslie, to the principal's office. Leslie, get your ass up here and give me that damn box! - Wow, what's going on? Wow. - I left your note in that box. - "Beam, we secured Walker at 'Forgotten World.' "I'll see you at the Underground Plaza "when all this blows over. "Here's the box, you know the rest. "Walt."
