[instrumental music] [instrumental music] -All right. -How we doing? -Thank you, my friend, you, too. -Sure. -Oh! Oh, my God. -Oh! Oh! Look, I'm sorry, I'm so... -Oh! Here, let me... Oh! -Get your hand off! -So sorry, I'm sorry! -Oh, my God! I have to go to a meeting and I-I can't show up like this. I'm really sorry. L-look, I live right across the street here. There's-there's soap and water there, you can clean yourself up there, yeah? -Sure. Fine... -S-sorry, it's right this way. Take... Just a minute... I'm so... -Uh, Jesus! -Sorry. Okay, it's right this way. It's the last room on the right. -Thank you. -Sure. Sorry, again. [sighs] God! [groans] What? [groans] [sighs] [moans] -Baby! -Oh. You're doing great character. [Ethan] So, did you enjoy it? -Mmm-hmm. I mean... -Good. I don't know if Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts would approve, but... No, I think they're all about the artistic liberties. Oh, okay. I'm sad, I gotta go back to the office. -You do? -Mmm-hmm. -Um... -I gotta go. W-w-wait, wait a second. -Baby, I have a meeting. -I know. Just, before you go... look in the walk-in closet. -What? -Mmm-hmm. What is in this walk-in closet? [instrumental music] -Wow! -[Colette] Oh. Okay, baby, this is too much. I mean, maybe I can put something underneath here for the office, but red bottoms? -You didn't have to. -Yeah, but I love spoiling you. -[Colette] Ooh! -And... You look amazing, so it's not selfless. -You did good. -Thank you. -So, I have to run. -Okay. -So, dinner tonight or... -Oh, no, I wish I could. But I-I have to go see my mom back at home. [clicks tongue] Okay. But I'm making your favorite. -Oh, no. -Cioppino! -No, not the cioppino. -Hmm-hmm. Okay. I'll be back. Okay. [mellow music] Be right back. Ah-ah! What are you doing? -She's over an hour late. -Well, she'll be here. Honestly, why don't you get your own clients, Brenda, so you don't have to steal Colette's? Oh, it's not stealing if they'd rather work with me. You can get your own clients, love. Hey, guys, uh... Mr. Allen, I'm so sorry I made you wait. I know how valuable your time is. -Colette! -Okay, okay, fine. -Spill it. -I met Ethan for lunch today. -Girl, not a midday snack. -Mmm-hmm. Let's just say we did a little role playing. Ooh. So, what are we talking? Sexy maid? Doctor patient? -Girl! Stop. -Hot plumber? Okay, wait, remember the scene inNotting Hill, where Hugh Grant spills the juice on Julia Roberts? -And then they kind of... -Okay, yeah. -Do a few things! -Right. What about it? Well, we reenacted that scene. So then, we went back to his place... -Okay! -And, girl... We just started ripping each other's clothes off. Sis! That's what I'm talking about, yes! Girl, I am so happy you are trying new things. Yeah, i-it's Ethan, I mean... I don't know, he brings a side out of me that I just... never thought I had. It's just Ethan. He just brings out this side of me... -I never knew I had. Oh, my God! -[Colette] Shut up. -Oh, my God, you're so annoying. -You kinky little bitch. Shut up. [phone whirring] Oh, my God, it's Ethan. -Hi, babe. -[Ethan]Hey, my love. When are you leaving the office? Dinner is almost ready for you. Okay, yeah, I'm-I'm gonna leave the office now. I'll see you in a bit. I love you. [Ethan]I love you, too. [Colette] Okay, bye. I love you? Already? Can you believe it? I mean, it's like love at first sight. It just, it feels right. Okay, well, when you know you know. I'm just happy you're getting all this good eat. And the love, don't forget that. Right, of course, and the love. -Okay, love you. -Love you! Okay, bye. I'll let you know how the food is. -Okay, sounds so good. -You know what? You're not gonna need this. Enjoy. Bye. [instrumental music] Good morning, sleepy head. Hey. Brought you some coffee.

[Ethan chuckles] You know, I can remember the first day we met. You know the first thing I noticed about you? -Hmm? -Your cute feet. -What? -No, no, no, I'm-I'm serious. Being serious, okay. [Colette chuckles] But it was your smile that got me. And then even more... it was the immediate connection that we had. Connection I've never felt with anyone before. -Hmm. -You know, I... I feel like I can truly be myself with you. And that kind of love doesn't happen very often. Once in a lifetime. So, with that being said... I know it's very soon. I know that I'm crazy. But I also know that I'm certain. Colette Mainor... -Mmm-hmm. Yes! -Will you marry-- -Yes. -What? Wait, ho-hold on. -You haven't seen the ring yet. -I don't care. [Ethan] Oh! I love you. [both chuckle] Ho-hold on, let me show you the ring. [chuckles] Okay, maybe I care a little. [Ethan chuckles] [instrumental music] [Colette gasps] [Colette] Oh, my God. Babe, this is... -This is too much. -You like it? Yes. [sighs] Well, you didn't get your dream wedding, so... I figured, the least I could do is gift you with your dream home. Babe, this is a lot. You spoil me too much. [Ethan] I know it's not the estate, but... No. It's gorgeous. I love you. [Stephanie] Ann, I have Ethan for you. [suspenseful music] Hold my calls. Thank you, Stephanie. [Ethan] You wanted to see me, Ann? Sit. Daniel tells me you got married? [sighs] Ethan... I don't like to waste my time on personal matters. Unfortunately, as junior partner, your personal choices affect all of us. Due to the terms of our partnership, you have an ownership stake in this firm. I-I don't see how my marriage-- [Ann] Do you have a prenuptial agreement? No. I find your lack of foresight astounding, Ethan. You're a lawyer. How do we know we can trust her? I barely trust you right now. Door closed. [tense music] [Colette] Are you sure you're not mad at us, mom? Well, not for eloping, but... -For going to Vegas without me? -Oh! I knew she was gonna say that. But you know, I have my everyday Vegas now. And, son, that place you've got me... Baby, they have bingo night. And I'm gathering up a group to play poker. Now, you better behave, mom. -Glad you're having fun. -Mmm! It is so much fun, it's like living on a luxury cruise, honey. See? I told you. Yeah, he did. -You're right. -[Carol] Okay, sis! I see you. This is beautiful. -[Colette] Right? -I love it. It's a little far from the office, though. I mean, how long does it take you to get to work in the morning, like an hour? A little with traffic. But... it's worth it, I mean, look at it. -[Lainey] Yeah, it's beautiful. -It's beautiful. Suburbs must be a little bit of an adjustment. So, Ms. Mainor, how about some more wine? -Absolutely. -Okay. -Pour it on me. -Pour it on. -Keep it coming. -Keep it coming. Thank you, and... and you can call me mom, son. -[Carol] Yeah. You can. Yep. -I can? Thank you, mom. There you are. So... I've been putting some details together. -For your bachelorette party. -[Colette] Okay. And at first I was thinking of Miami, but no. We gotta go bigger, so... What do you think about Jamaica? -Stop it! Yes! -Ya, man! You down? -I've never been. -Yes, it'll be perfect. We have to tell all my friends. Do I get to go along this time? [Lainey] Do not tempt me, Ms. Carol. Okay, we know about your dance moves. You were outshining us all. -Mom! -You wanna see another one? [laughs] -Ey! -[Colette] Ey! -We can take her anywhere! -Oh, mama! [chuckling] -Babe. No, look. -Look. I'm not going to have the bachelorette-- I said I know. All right? Sorry. I'm just... I'm protective over us. And I... I just think it's disrespectful for Lainey to suggest a bachelorette party after the wedding. No, no. Lainey's not being disrespectful at all. I promise, it's... We've been planning this for years and... she didn't get to do one for me before we eloped, that's it. I don't know. I don't... I don't think Lainey likes me. -What? -Yeah. She always has something negative to say about everything I-- -No, she doesn't. -She does, she... She had something negative to say about the eloping, the honeymoon. She even has something negative to say about me buying you this house, it's just... Okay, look, babe. You just, you can't take it personally. Lainey, she just... She has no filter. [Ethan clicks tongue] I don't know. I just don't get the impression that she's rooting for us. Hey. No, look at me. She is rooting for us. Okay? I promise. I hope so. -I really do. -She is. Okay. [both chuckle softly] Okay. So... -I was thinking... -Mmm-hmm. Maybe we could kick start our, uh... honeymoon with a special activity. Okay, I'm listening. Okay. So... There's this club. I've been there a couple of times, but it's sort of a... A place for sex parties. [chuckles] Okay, so, like a sex club? Kind of. [Colette] Uh-hmm. [chuckles] Hey... Do you trust me? Of course.

Hiya, Lai... Girl... Don't"Hiya Lainey" me. You're on the longest honeymoon in history. You were supposed to be back already. [Colette]I know. I'm sorry, amiga. Look, Ethan is a partner at his law firm. You, my dear, are still an employee. Girl, you better bust some moves. 'Cause you'll be coming back to zero listings. [Brenda] The big pool with the guest house on the side. -That's nice. -More bathrooms and a pool. Nice of you to finally join us again. I know. How long has it been? Three weeks? Really good math skills, Brenda. Don't get salty, Colette. We can't all have the same priorities. I just never thought of you as a wifey type. You know, Brenda, maybe you, uh, shouldn't stick your nose in people's situations. It will work out for you. I really don't care. But it affects me. What? My marriage affects you? Oh, it's not about your marriage, honey. It's a fact that you don't come to work. Someone has to pick up your slack. Okay, that one... I might catch a case for that one. [scoffs] She's so annoying. [gasps] Anyway, girl, what's tea? -Stop! Shh! -Ahh! Right. -I haven't been back. -Okay. Shh! Tell me everything. Everything about your honeymoon. It was amazing! I mean, seriously. -Multiple orgasms. -Yes. I mean, I've been trying some new things. -Uh-oh! What new things? -Shh! We went to a sex club. -A sex club? -A sex club. It was beautiful, it was huge and fun. -And I think I'm obsessed. -Yes. -Colette. -And he is just... Making me feel more open. [car alarm blaring in distance] -What? -Hold on. [car alarm blaring in distance] Uh-mm. Is she serious? [scoffs] God, she is so annoying. What? Is she soliciting to strangers in the parking lot now? [Lainey] How do you know? So predictable, right? [scoffs] Anyway... Back to your multiple orgasms, and lavish pampering. -One piece of advice, though. -[Colette] Hmm-hmm. Great sex can be highly addictive, so... Be careful not to lose yourself. Uh, girl... Careful about being addicted to multiple orgasms? -That sounds pretty good to me. -I feel you. My vibrators will tell you. I'm just saying, you know... -Pace yourself. -Okay. [Lainey] Colette, I'm serious. -I hear you. -Seriously. Some of my worst decisions have been made for good dick. Hey, babe. I'll be back in a few hours, okay? [Ethan] What? Where are you going? My mom. She forgot her meds and injection. Babe, we have plans. I'll be back before Lainey and Daniel get here. See. You're always doing whatever you want whenever you want, without any consideration for me. Babe, my-my mom forgot her prescription. You know she needs those muscle relaxant injections, right? So what? They have their own pharmacists and nurses there. I need your help with this dinner. Okay. That's fair. But you don't have to talk to me like that. You're right. You're right. I'm-I'm sorry. I'm just... I'm just stressed out. And I'm excited. It's our first dinner party in our house as a married couple. [chuckles softly] You're so cute. [crickets chirp] -Hey. -Hey. Ooh. That looks good. Oh! Well, thank you. I'll make you one too. Just so you know... the jig is up. I know this is a set up. [Ethan] Oh. Yeah. Well... -Daniel's a great guy. -Hmm. So I've heard. I've also heard that you like to walk on the wild side. -What do you mean? -Toys! Safe words, sex clubs. How did you get Colette to do it? Maybe you don't know my wife as well as you think you do. [pensive music] After the deposition, Johnson runs into my office and submits an offer. [laughing] Of course he did. So... how long have you two been in real estate? Hmm, actually, we've been, um, at Premiere for, what? Six years? Uh, yeah. Just been paying our dues before we start our own agency. Morgan and Mainor. [both chuckle] I never heard about this plan. Yeah. Oh, my God, we've been talking about this forever. Yeah. And now, we think it's time to actually get it done. -Like, we got to get it done. -Hmm-hmm. -[Lainey] Mmm-hmm. -Good. Sounds like it's all set then. -Yeah. -[Ethan] Yeah. [Daniel] Well, I think it's an amazing venture. In fact, if you want to get into commercial real estate, I have a client, Joe Richardson. -[Lainey] Oh! -I'm havin' a... [clears throat] Sorry, did you say Joe Richardson? He owns some of the hottest clubs in town. And that's your client? He's been having a hard time finding the right location for his new speakeasy. [Lainey] Oh! I might be able to help with that. -Yeah? -Yeah. You wanna, maybe go meet him at his bar after dinner? Uh... Yeah. Actually, I think I'd like that. [chuckles] Uh, cheers. -To new connections. -To new connections. [Daniel] New connections. [glasses clinks] So, when were you gonna tell me about this new venture with Lainey? Oh. Uh... I don't know. When we had an actual business plan. But, don't you think it's a little fishy to start a business behind my back? Baby! That is not what we're doing. I mean, Lainey and I have been talking about it for years. I mean, obviously, if it becomes a reality, I would tell you. Hmm. I'm sorry, it's just... I don't know, I've been feeling a little bit like a third wheel in my own marriage. Baby, no! Why would you think that? Because of the fact that you told her about our intimate details. You told her about the safe word... you told her about the toys. You told her about the sex club. I am so sorry. I-I didn't think that would bother you. You didn't think that would bother me? No. I mean, Lainey's my best friend. I see it as a special bond between us... when you go and you just tell your best friend... it feels less intimate. Okay. Yeah. I completely understand. And I promise, it will never happen again. Good. [pensive music] With the current house market, it would be a very sparkling move to invest in IRE. [Ethan clears throat] -Hey. -Hey. What? You're stunning. You're just saying that 'cause you love me. No. No, no, no. You are objectively stunning. And brilliant. I have some bad news though. I talked to Conrad, he's not gonna be able to make it. But it's fine. I have some other wealthy clients I'll introduce you to. Okay. Yeah, um... It's fine. I guess it gives me more time to prepare. You're more than prepared. You just know all the right things to say, huh? I guess I do. Ah-ah-ah. Can you be obedient? -Yeah. -Good. Ah! -Ah! -Keep your back arched. -And don't move. -Okay. [upbeat music] [Ethan]Love the sex party. [Colette chuckles]Yes. [sighs] [moaning] [music continues] [vocalizing] [indistinct song on speakers] [vocalizing continues] [vocalizing continues] [instrumental music] Excuse us. Are you Ethan's girlfriend? I'm his wife. His what? [music continues] -Wait, Ethan. -Yeah? -Who is she? -She is my ex-girlfriend. What? Do you still have feelings for her? No. No, it's not like that. So what is it like? I mean... Fiona is mentally ill. We had a fight and she got physical. Why did you fight? Because I wanted to break up with her and she didn't want to. And then when I tried to leave, she got physical. I had a restraining order issued on her. Why didn't you tell me? Because I thought it was over. Look, if she ever approaches you again, I want you to call me immediately. All right? -Okay. -[Ethan] Let's go. [suspenseful music] How did she get out? Does it really matter? I thought she was gone forever. We can't reinstate the restraining order. And a court order commitment will take time. Even for me. [grunts] Ethan, pull yourself together. Daniel, take care of Fiona. Ethan has lost control of the situation. Yes, ma'am. [door closes] [Ethan sniffles] Mmm-hmm. That feels so good, baby. I'm really sorry for letting Fiona ruin our night last night. Oh, no. I mean, it didn't. We had a threesome. [chuckles] -Did you enjoy it? -[Colette] Yes, I did. I mean, it was... erotic and tantalizing. Well, you said "red" a few times. I was worried that you weren't enjoying it. I don't know. I guess I just... I wasn't sure if I can go through it. Maybe it's time we get rid of the safe word. I thought it was necessary. For people who aren't as connected as we are. -Right? -Mm-hm. Trust me. I think I know your limits. And think about it.. Think about all the pleasure you've been missing out on when you freak yourself out in the moment. -Yeah. I trust you. -[Ethan] You do? I do like when you push me outside of my comfort zone. Good. I'm shook. Colette Marie Davis, you had a threesome? Maybe. [chuckles] -How was it? -Okay, it was amazing! -It was so good. -[Lainey] And? And, um, it actually kinda ended little weird. -What? Why? -[Colette] Yeah. There was this server actually who came up to me afterwards. -She wanted a threesome too? -Girl, no! Look, it actually ended up being Ethan's psycho ex-girlfriend. -What? Psycho how? -[Colette] Yeah. Well, he has a restraining order on her. Isn't that crazy? Yeah. I wonder what her side is. What? Why? I mean, clearly the law sided with him. Anytime a guy says they have a "crazy ex-girlfriend..." Yeah, I'm suspicious. Honestly, most guys drive us crazy, which is very different from us actually being crazy. Okay, Lainey, but clearly, Fiona is a psycho. I mean, She was committed by court order. I mean, it is what it is. -Colette. Come. -Yes. The Riverlane Park estate is looking for an agent. Um, I have bandwidth, if you need help. [both] No! Incredible! [upbeat music] [Daniel] So... You changed your name to Sharon Rogers. Should've just stayed hidden, Fiona. You think you found me? Why do you think I work here? What, you were looking for him? You know, it was really quite easy. Ethan is pretty predictable. [scoffs] Thought you would've learnt your lesson and stayed away from us. I don't scare easily. Oh, so we didn't put you through enough. Oh, you did. Then why are you begging for more? [scoffs] Where do you think you're going? [grunts] Bitch! [grunting] [tapping on glass] [sighs] Okay. Look at you, girl. -This is a Monday first. Hey. -Hey. I thought you had a open-house. Uh, no. Are you looking into Ethan? Yes. But only because I wanted to see what the restraining order says. -Why? -Because... You just met this guy online like a couple of months ago. Everybody meets everybody online. What do you mean? You go to random bars and see guys that you don't even remember the next day. Okay. But, I looked into this. And there are no restraining orders from Ethan on any Fiona. -You are unbelievable. -Did you hear me? He lied! Maybe I got the wrong name. Maybe it's not Fiona. You didn't get the wrong name. There aren't any restraining orders filed by Ethan. Not a single one. Lainey, you have to back off. But he is lying to you. Don't you wanna know why? [Colette] Seriously, leave it alone. -Colette! -No, leave it alone. Don't be stupid, it's a red flag. Excuse me. You know, you might not care about my marriage, but if you care about us and this friendship, you'll stop. I don't understand why you always have to insert yourself into everything. You don't deserve to be into every aspect of my life. I got this. [somber music] Honestly, it's Lainey. She just, she won't back off. Oh, honey. Lainey is just trying to be protective. -By destroying my marriage? -Oh, Colette! Will you stop being so dramatic? Mom, no, I'm not being dramatic. Okay? Half of my arguments with Ethan are because of Lainey. Is it because of Lainey, or is it that it's just a symptom of something else? Whose side are you on? You know I'm always on your side. But sometimes, it includes calling you out. Hello, Ms. Caroline. I didn't know you were visiting us today. Sweet surprise. Right? Yeah. I just prefer no surprises. He just likes to be a prepared host. Okay, so you are done. You like 'em? -Well? -Nothing. -He's not picking up. -Thank you, Stephanie. Why aren't you worried about this? Daniel's missing and Fiona's stalking me. Worrying has never solved a problem. Can you please find Daniel? And take care of the Fiona situation? -Of course. -Thank you. Ethan... I'm not sure how much longer I will have the energy or interest to clean up after you. Close the door.

No! Take this off of me now! I'm serious! Ethan! Take this off me, please! What is wrong with you? I said, no means no! Take this off! Ethan! -Ethan. -Stop. -We need to talk. -Tomorrow. When you've calmed down and aren't hysterical. -No, I wasn't hysterical. -Really? Because what you pulled seemed very hysterical to me. It was a panic attack. It's hard to have an honest conversation with you when I gotta constantly walk on eggshells. -What? -[Ethan] No, no, listen to me. [Ethan] Listen to me. You-you get so upset with the smallest thing I do. -[Colette] What? -Right? And if I had a panic attack every time you hurt me, it wouldn't seem like I'm the bad guy. No, don't do that. No. Do not use my mental health against me. Your mental health. You see? That's what I'm talking about. I can't share an honest feeling without you, you turning into the victim and me turning into the fucking monster, right? I don't know what the fuck you're talking about. It is all about you! It's... It is all about you! Everything! All you-you-your feelings! An-an-and your trauma! All your shit! Everything you do gets excused and everything I do gets scrutinized. Right? But I don't get to get upset. Do I? Just so sick of going from crazy person to crazy person. What? Ethan, don't. [somber music] Our quarterly numbers are down. As to be expected, because counts are down all in our area. Interest rates are fluctuating all over the place and it's kinda been... it's pretty bad overall. This is far below historical averages. Hey. Hey, what's going on? I think I fucked shit up with Ethan. [Gustavo] We see the first decrease in demand and supply. [breathing heavily] I can't fix it. [breathing heavily] [dramatic music] [Lainey] Just breathe, okay? I'm sorry. -Is get our inventory out as-- -Hey! Wait! -What's going on? -Um, she's not feeling too good. You guys can just, just continue on. [sniffling] [crying] [breathing heavily] Look, babe, I'm here. I'm here, I'm here, I'm here. It's all right. You're okay. You're okay. Come on, focus on the numbers. I just want you to focus on your numbers. That's all, okay? -Okay, here we go. 60. 57. -60. 57. -Fifty-four. -I can't breathe. -I can't breathe. -54. -[Lainey] Forty-eight. -Forty-eight. -[Lainey] Forty-one. -Forty-one. [Lainey] Um... Just focus on those numbers. 60. [breathing heavily] Thirty-nine. No, it's okay. I got you. I got you. I got you. Focus, focus. So you're feeling better? -I'm just so embarrassed . -Girl, don't be embarrassed. It was Brenda and Gustavo. Please, who cares what they think? Yeah. You sure you're okay to go home alone? Uh, yeah, um, if he sees you, he'll just get more upset. Okay. Fine. Just... Just remember, okay. You did nothing wrong. I handled it horribly. -What are you talking about? -No, come on. He ignores your boundaries. Broke your trust, and he gaslit you. And then somehow managed to make you feel inadequate? You don't get it. He's very sensitive. Okay? And then, I get triggered and... I just become selfish. And make it all about me and my trauma. No! That's not what you're doing. You didn't do anything wrong. And anyway, it's normal to feel consumed when you're having a panic attack. Doesn't mean that I get to make it about me. But that's not what you're doing. Erm, honestly, what? You can't even have your own voice anymore or your own feelings? I ju... I can't do this, right now. Okay? It's, it's been a lot today. I love you. I gotta go. [Lainey] Love you too. Hi, babe. [Ethan] Hi. I don't like how we ended last night. [Colette] Okay. Neither do I. I've been thinking about it all day. Right. What is it? You know there's nothing wrong with me liking what I like, right? No. Of course not. I thought we were unbreakable. We are unbreakable. Right? -I don't know anymore. -What? Wait, what are... What're you saying? That you're giving up on us? I don't want to. But maybe we just need to get away. You know, just us. Let's go to the... let's go to the estate. [sighing] -Really? -Yeah. Okay, yes, let's do it. I just, I have to see my mom on Friday. Well, is it something than can wait? 'Cause I was hoping we could pack and leave tomorrow morning. I just... I haven't seen her in a few days. But, um, we can go after that. You know what? I will reschedule. That's fine. I'll reschedule. -I'm gonna go get ready. -Okay. [instrumental music] [Colette] Hey, babe. Your lunch is ready. [cellphone whirring] [line ringing] [Colette]Hi, this is Colette Davis. I'm not able to answer... [pensive music] [sighs] Okay. -[Colette] Hey. -Hey. You okay? Did you know you never initiated a text exchange? Uh, no, I haven't noticed. I'm always the one to text you first. I guess some of us just have different priorities. Hey, Gustavo. Do you know why Colette hasn't been showing up for work? [Gustavo] I thought she would've told you. She's taking a few weeks off because of the manic depressive episode. No. That makes no sense. Colette's not manic-- Take it up with her husband. That's who told me, and sent me a doctor's note. [birds chirping] [Colette] I thought we came here to fix things. I don't know if we truly have a future anymore. I want a partnership. I want someone who prioritizes our marriage. -Baby, I want that too. -Yeah, you say you want to. But are you able to? Yes. Yes! And look, I promise I will not say anything to Lainey anymore. I'm gonna put us first. I really wanted it to work. [Colette] Good. Me too. -Cheers. -Yeah. [bottles clinking] So, you haven't heard from her either? [Carol]No, I haven't heard from her in about a week, but they went to his weekend home. [Lainey]This is crazy. She usually texts me back right away. This is just not like her. [Carol]She has been acting different. Hi, babe. I made you some pudding. Oh. Okay. Hmm. Mmm. You know what? I need to make you some of my chocolate pudding from scratch. You don't have to eat it if you don't like it. Oh, all right. Someone's a little sensitive tonight. It's fine. Look, um, I've been thinking... and, maybe we should go back home. -Why? -Well, it's been two weeks. Yeah, but I thought we said we'd stay until we repaired our relationship. You don't think we're in a good place right now? Why are you in such a rush to go back? I'm not in a rush to go back. I just... I just have to get back to things. I knew it. Everything you said about putting us first, about understanding what a marriage needs... You just, you didn't mean it. -Of course, I meant it. -[Ethan] Oh. And-and I still mean it. Look, just because we're in a marriage doesn't mean I have to lose every aspect of my life. Ask anyone to be in a marriage... i-i-it, it-it won't last if you won't put it in the work. Okay, so you're telling me that I'm not a good wife? There you go, playing the victim. No, I'm just... confused. You keep saying that I don't make you happy, that I-I don't fulfill you. [Ethan] Okay, see and... There it is. Now you wanna give up. Great. -I'm not giving up, okay? -[Ethan] Oh. -I just don't know what to do. -[Ethan] Hey! Hey, hey, hey! Stop. Who the hell do you think you are? Don't you ever talk to me like that? Ethan, I don't know how to talk to you when you're upset like this. Okay. We'll see. -Do not move away from me! -Ethan, let go of me! I'm not gonna let go of... Hey! -Let go of me! -Look at me. Look at me. You're my wife, and you're gonna listen. You understand? -Ethan! You're hurting me. -You think you're... Hey. I will let you go when you listen. -Let go. Let me go. -No. Come-come here. -Come on! -No! Good morning. I made your breakfast. Hope you like it. Baby, please, just untie me. Please. No. I think we need a refresher course in our wedding vows. Love, honor, obey. It's not meant to be literal. [sighs] God, I just wish you could be a good wife. This isn't a marriage. You are kidnapping me. No, I love you. This is me not giving up on us. So... this is a conservatorship. It states that you suffer from clinical manic depression. And I am your caregiver. No judge is gonna sign off on that. It's already signed. [chuckles] It's always good to have powerful friends. What is wrong with you? Well, love makes you do crazy things, doesn't it? And I wanna keep us together forever. Ethan, if you love me, then you'll untie me. No one's ever gonna believe that I need a conservatorship. On the contrary, actually, it'll be very easy with your history of... Uh, let's see... Clinical depression, sexual assault, trauma, attempted suicide in college. Oh, and your little breakdown at the office helps. A lot of people saw the beginning of your emotional spiral. You're so sick. You're sick, Ethan. That's not a nice thing to say to your husband. I'll let you process. Ethan, untie me! Please! Fuck! [exhales] -Bye, see you tomorrow. -Excuse me. Hi. Um, do you work here? Why? I don't know anything about your husband. Um, no, actually, I'm looking for a girl. I think she might be a server here. Her name might be Fiona. I don't think her name is Fiona. But one of them is there, she might know. Thank you. Fiona! Hey, Fiona? Wait. Wait, Fiona, please! Stop! Hey! Hey! Please, I need your help. Are you with Ann? Because I swear to God... My best friend, Colette, she-she's married to Ethan... your ex. -She's missing. Please. -Fuck... Fuck! Can you help? Oh, my God. Thank you. I stuck around for two years like a fucking idiot. Look... -Ethan is not to be trusted. -I know that. And did your friend tell you about his kinks and preferences? -Being dominant. -That's not all. Ethan doesn't like subs. -He prefers insubs. -Insubs? Involuntary submissive. His pleasure comes from... pushing people past their comfort zones. If it's consensual, he doesn't enjoy it. They are at Ethan's estate. Some country house far as fuck. But... I don't know how to get there. I think I may have an idea of how to find out how to. [dramatic music] I should have gotten rid of him a long time ago. [scoffs] You're right. At the first sign of insubordination. Stephanie, look. But I do like a challenge. [chuckling] -You always have. -Mm-hm. He has completely lost it again. I need you to go and take care of it. Of course. [door opens] Oh! You look beautiful. Hi. Hi, baby. [Ethan] I made you this pudding... from scratch. [chuckles softly] -You wanna try it? -That's so sweet. Ho-hold on, baby. I-I need you to untie me. Okay? I wanna make this work. -Please, just untie me. -Shh. -[Colette] No, no, no. Just... -Shh. -[Colette] Baby, please. -Shh-shh. -[Colette] I'm your wife. -Hey! I'm talking. Just sit there... say nothing... and let me talk. [sighs] -I feel like I can't trust you. -But you can't trust me. I'm not gonna tell you again to stop talking. So... pudding? -Yeah. -No, Ethan. -Baby, I need you to untie me. -Shh. Hey. Hey No, I need you to untie me! I don't want your fucking pudding. [crying] Ethan, untie me. Please. Don't leave. Do not leave! [crying] [pensive music] [Lainey] Yeah, they're there. He's definitely in there. I saw his car. Now what? Kick his ass... and save your friend. No. I think we should... I think we should call the police. [scoffs] Good luck with them. [phone beeping] [dispatcher]9-1-1. What's your emergency? [Lainey] Hi, yes, um... I think my friend is being held against her will by her husband. -[dispatcher]Domestic dispute? -Uh, maybe. [dispatcher]Is anyone in imminent danger, right now? I don't know, probably. [dispatcher]Is there a crime in progress? Look, she hasn't been answering my calls and she stopped showing up to work. There has to be something wrong. [dispatcher]You wanna file a missing persons report? I wanna do whatever I need to do to get the police to come to her residence and make sure she's safe. [dispatcher]Okay, ma'am. We'll try to send over a wellness check. Try? Wait... And there they go. [crying] [Fiona]So how long do you wanna wait on the cops? I mean, you heard her, they'll try. Fuck it. [dramatic music] [door opens] Hey, Ethan. I'm looking for Colette. I don't know where she is. Well, you don't seem worried at all. We fought, she left. Typical MO. [Lainey grunts] Didn't I just tell you, she's not here? No, she's in here. Colette! -Hey! -Colette! I could kill you myself. [groans] Hey! Shut up! [groaning] [Fiona grunts] -Fiona! -I hate you! No! No, no, no, no! [Lainey breathing heavily] [Lainey coughing] -Why did you do that? -Jesus! [Lainey gasps] [coughing] [breathing heavily] [Lainey] Colette! Lainey! -Colette. -[Colette] Lainey! I'm here, Colette. Where are you? [Colette] Lainey... Up here! Please! -Please, hurry up. -Colette. Colette, where are you? [Colette] Lainey, can you hear me? -I'm coming. -[Colette] Help! Colette! Colette... -Oh, my God! Help me, please! -Oh, my God! -Please! -Shit! -Where is he? -Is he still alive? -Still breathing. -Good. I need him alive. Colette... Nice to meet you, I'm Fiona. -Thank you for everything. -[Fiona] Yeah. Okay, okay. I already called the cops, and they should be here soon. -So, let's go. -No! I need him to confess before the police get here. This asshole has a conservatorship on me, and I want him to admit it was fraudulent. Here, I got you. [both grunting] Oh, shit. He's waking up. [Fiona grunting] Fiona, wait! Stop! He's down. All right, then. [breathing heavily] It's okay. I have a plan. We're about to control this shit. [dramatic music] -What the hell is this? -It's just Ethan. What are you doing? No, no, no. We don't need that. I have my mom's prescription. With enough dosage, we can paralyze his body while he's still alive. Oh, I like that. Y'all don't wanna just wait for the police? -No! -Okay, damn. Come on, Lainey. [Lainey] If you two are gonna make this last a while, I'm gonna need some booze. Just need him to wake up. With those blows to the head, we don't know when or if he will? But we have to wait until the cops get here, anyway. [Fiona sighs] So what are your mental health issues? He likes to pick women with the history of them. When I was a teenager, I used to self-harm. -I guess, depression. -Hey, don't be ashamed. He picks women like us because it fits his narrative better. Okay, he... picks us and then... love-bombs us... and then isolates us. And before you realize that you're into deep, you just... Just count yourself lucky. Things could be a lot worse. What's worse than marrying a fucking psychopath? Ethan's college sweetheart... she died of erotic asphyxiation. -They gave Ethan manslaughter. -What? -How is he practicing law? -Good old, Ann. That lady is very, very connected. She got his record expunged so that Ethan here could go to law school. What? This explains... This asshole... this is how he got the conservatorship signed. Who the fuck are these people? You've got to get indisputable evidence against them. You know, something that Ann can't fix or hide with favors. [coughs] Oh, he's waking up. [coughs] [groans] Ethan. Ethan, wake up? Can you hear me? What the fuck did you do to me? Well, I hit you over the head, honey bun. Quite a few times, actually. And we gave you an overdose of muscle relaxants. That's why you sound like crap and can't move. Ethan, it's over. Confess. Confess? I have nothing to confess. I did nothing wrong. What? You fabricate false documents. You hurt women mentally, emotionally and physically. And you killed your college sweetheart. I did nothing to anyone that they didn't want. You're a disgusting fucking pig, Ethan! [groans] [coughs] [Ethan groans] Baby... I love you. Help me, please. Just, just come uncuff me. No. You're not worth my love. [groans] All right, so Ethan is mental, which means, to get him to confess we've got to be mental too. So we gotta play dirty, you know, like... get in his mind. How the hell you get inside of a narcissistic psychopath's head? I mean, honestly, we could just leave. You know what we gotta do? We gotta go find his phone. That's what we're gonna do. We're gonna find his phone... You look down here and we're gonna go upstairs. -Yeah. -Lainey, come on. Okay. Why... Why do you need me? Well, now you and I can finally play, my love. You see, Ethan... I'm not actually interested in a confession. No. [clicking tongue] See, what I'm interested in... is revenge. Come and get it, bitch. [chuckles softly] -No luck here. -Me neither. Wow, this place is a maze. [Colette] Yeah, I bet he did that on purpose. Oh, my God! Fiona. What did you do? I found his cell. It was in his jean's pocket. Of course. Is nobody gonna acknowledge the fact that Fiona almost beat him to death? As long as his face unlocks his phone, I don't care. I'm not trying to go to jail for being an accomplice. That ship sailed a long time ago, sweetheart. You guys, help. Mm. [Ethan breathing heavily] Settle. Bingo! [Colette] What does it say? Give me a sec. He's not gonna have some revealing text saved as a screenshot. Well, with this one, you never know. Okay, here's a group chat. It's called "The sublimation." They take orders from someone named Ms. Kativa. Her name is Ann. They have codes and assignments. They have a whole doctrine. -What? What? -Oh, my God. Gross. -I can't read this anymore. -No, Lainey, we need to know. Colette, no! Okay? Trust me. You don't wanna know. But we definitely got this fucker. Okay. Putting Ethan in jail is just... isn't good enough. Fiona, stop. I mean, we have enough evidence to put him away. He's not worth murdering for. Don't make me use this... on you. You got to stop. I'll stop, when with his last breath, Ethan begs me too. Hey, baby! You remember the safe word, right? Fiona, stop! [Fiona] Why are you defending this monster? I helped you. Now it's my turn. Let me do my thing. [grunts] I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. Oh, shit. [siren wailing] What did you do to me? [Colette] I just... I couldn't let you ruin your life over him. You'll be fine. Call the cops. [dramatic music] [music continues] [Fiona] You.. Step... Stephanie. Stephanie, no, she's with Ann. She's with Ann. She's not... How did you get here? No, no, no. No, no! She's with Ann. She's with "Sublimation." She's with Mistress Kativa. No! So, listen to me, Colette. She's not real. Please! You have to listen to me. Please, she's not real. She isn't real! No. No! No! No! No! -No, this is not real. No! No! -[woman] It's all right. You guys said, that you, uh, have Ethan's phone. Oh, uh, Lainey. Wow. This is some compelling evidence. Yeah, is it enough for them to press charges? More than enough. Now, you both can come down to the station and make a formal statement. Look, don't worry. We'll take care of him. And, uh, what about Fiona? She'll get the treatment she needs. You guys have a good day. Thank you, officer. [Fiona breathing heavily] I'm so happy that's over. Me too. Lainey, I'm... I'm so sorry. You've been telling me all along, and I just didn't listen. I'm just happy you're safe. You know what's weird? She never even asked us for our contact information. Yeah. -The car was... weird. -Weird. [suspenseful music] [footsteps approaching] [suspenseful music] [dramatic music] That'll be all. Yes, ma'am. [Ann] Thank you. Ethan, you're a fuck up. I'm so tired of cleaning up your shit. You're so pathetic. Your attempts at being a dom... are over. You're a sub. You were born a sub. You had one fucking rule to follow... consent. Do you understand me? Yes. Yes... what? Yes, Mistress Kativa. Okay, oh. Come on. [groaning] Oh, it'd be over soon. There you go. Good boy. [Ethan groaning] [groaning] [groaning]
