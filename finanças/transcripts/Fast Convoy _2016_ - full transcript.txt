SOUTH SPAIN, MALAGA 16H09 on our way What's that? Food and drink. OK, give me something to eat. Got nothing savory? Wait 'till Paris. It makes you thirsty. Did you sleep badly? Didn't you? Was your bed good? Yeah, OK. Mine wasn't. I'm not asking for luxury, but the hotel was crap. It stank. And as for the guy in the next room... I phoned my old lady earlier. -And? -Her legs hurt. That's a bad sign. This is the 13th trip, too. The next is the 14th. There won't be a next trip. What's this blue bag? It's for the Mahmoudis, you know. No, I don't. -Imad said-- -He didn't tell me. How much is there? Seven kilos. He said-- He didn't tell me. The Gambian's buyer got busted, so he sold it cheap. It's good stuff, don't worry. Good stuff? There's already 650 kilos-- It's only hash in the trunk! Transporting coke is a different ball game. With a good lawyer, we'd get three years tops. That's a ten stretch. See the difference? You lot are crazy. I don't give a shit about the Mahmoudis. They're safe up in Creil. Fuckin' tight-fisted cunts! You get a lot more for coke, understand? Imad didn't tell me. He said-- He didn't say a word, OK? What about Yacine and Rémi? Just the seven kilos. Just seven kilos? Are you serious? What'll you tell the judge? "I only had seven kilos?" For personal use! Not surprised my old lady's legs hurt. She said they really hurt. No, I'm not asleep. The brothers told me to take it. Listen, it was at the last minute. Majid, we'll discuss it in Paris. Just tell me where you are. Get off the fuckin' line. I gotta keep it clear. Majid! Hello? Hello? The fucker hung up on me. Imad doesn't decide anyway. Does he? Just drive, OK? Rémi, where are you? Put your foot down, 'cause Majid and Elyes are catching up. Go on, speed up. Speed up. They're catching us up. Not with my fingers! My hand, see? You hold her pelvis like this. Her legs here. Her head to the floor. That way, you can rub your dick against her G-spot, see? And the chick'll come three times in a row. See? It's complicated, isn't it? -What is? -That thing with the hands. What's complicated? Do you wanna make 'em come? -I won't bother telling you. -No, go on. You don't give a shit? You think it's normal? We don't get paid extra for the coke. You're happy with that? They'll give us extra in Paris. Yeah, sure they will! They're as tight as a witch's cunt. Take our expenses. Take the hotel. How can you get by on 300 euros for two days? I had to buy the ice cream. Now this. Want my 50? Keep it. It's the principle of the thing. They want to slash prices with discount hash. It'll backfire on 'em one day. Cheap scumbags! Rémi, can you hear me? Cops at km 110. A cop car. I don't know what they're up to. Fuck! call! Fuck! Is it Majid? He won't give up. Imad... Yeah. I'm telling you... Good to work with you. Same here, bro. You're on the level. You and the Mahmoudis. I like that. later Yeah, right, "later"! Motherfucker! How was your vacation in Phuket? What's it like? I gotta see it for myself. Is it worth going? I bet I get busted this time. Chill out. I want an extra ten grand. Same for you. It's your first time, but you deserve it, too. Is that OK? C'mon... -Is that OK? -I don't want extra. I just wanna do the job. You won't back me up? Just like that? I got you this job. I know, but I want no trouble. I'll ask for 20 grand for me. Too bad for you. -He said kilometer 110? -Yeah. What's that? Call Majid. I can't get through. -It's busy. -Call Imad, then. I said, wait 'till Paris. Cut it out! Hang up, Majid. I need the line. Cut it out. It's not up to me! Still busy. They're staying there. I can see that. Call Imad! What the... You're a pain in the ass! What're you playing at? Still busy. Text him. Wait a sec. -Tell Majid to get out. -Shut up. He's gotta get out. -What's he playing at? -Give me that. Fuck the Mahmoudis! I want 20 grand more or I dump it! I'll open the window and dump it now! Calm down, Majid. No, it's between you and me! Imad... Hello? Motherfucker! -There's a text. -Fucker! There's a fuckin' text! Gotta get out. Now! Where? We missed the exit. Yeah, Rémi? Slow down. Majid... What're you doing? Alex? No, cops are checking cars at kilometer 110. Slow down. Did I ask you to speed up? No, I don't know if Elyes and Majid got out in time. There's no answer. Yeah. They must be there. Move, dammit! Fuck! Fuck, I'm hit! Majid, bro! Imad, we've got a problem here. Where are you? We're in the shit. Majid! Fuck! Majid, are you OK, bro? Hang on... Stop! Stop! -I didn't mean to-- -Move! Move it! Move! Move! -Drive. Move, dammit! -Wait, wait. I... Move! Do as I say or I'll kill you. Move! Get behind the wheel! Sit down! Sit down, for fuck's sake! Sit the fuck down! Oh, my God! Start the car! Go on, start the car! -OK! -Go on! -Quick! -OK! -Take a left! -OK, OK! -OK, OK! -Left! -OK! -Left! Drive straight through it. Faster! Take a right! Take a right! Faster, faster! I said, faster! -Go faster! -I am! Overtake it! -Overtake it now! -OK, OK! All right. You'll get us killed! Overtake! -All right! -Fast! Run the light. -Run the red light! -Wait! Faster! Faster! Faster! Faster! Faster! Faster! Faster! Shit, the SIM card! You haven't swallowed it? Open your mouth. Imad, it's Elyes. We got shot at. We've both been hit. I can't drive. What? Say that again! I don't understand. Where are you? What road? Wait, calm down. Can you see the cops or not? No. So, what do I do? As soon as you find somewhere quiet, stop the car. You hear me? Do you hear me? We're with you, bro. OK? Go on. Calm down. We're on our way. A girl's driving. What? Majid? Majid? Majid, you'll be OK, bro. You'll be OK. I told you to shut up. He's not fuckin' answering! He's not answering! Majid, wake up! Answer me! Answer me, please! Oh, fuck! Oh, fuck! I'm sorry. I'm sorry... If you save us, I'll spare you. -OK? -OK. I'll let you go, OK? OK. Don't we get out? Why not? Why don't we get out? I'm only... I'm only asking. I get it. We stay on 'till the border. -Were they hit? -One was. Who? -Which one? -He didn't say! Fuck! Majid's luck ran out this time. Praise be to God! I think it was Elyes. He said he can't drive. We were fuckin' lucky. Stop going on about fuckin' luck! Slow down. Turn left. Stop here. Turn the engine off. arbol montemayor road -Thanks. -Thank you. arbol montemayor road I can't feel a pulse. -You try. -No, I'm not a doctor. Oh, fuck! Hang on... Come on, buddy. Help me get him out. No. I want to go. You said I could go. -Not now. -Why not? Why not now? Come on, buddy. Majid? Majid? Majid? Majid? Oh. -Give me a fuckin' hand. -No. Give me a hand! Come on! Why does this happen to me now? We're fuckin' idiots. Risking our necks for 15 grand. Am I right? Yeah, whatever. Stop bugging me. We could make 100 times more without getting shot. Even if it was 200 times more, what would you do? Start your own business? Yeah. You'll do business with the Moroccans? Why not? How do you think the Mahmoudis got started? Talk to me about the G-spot. It's more credible. I worked it all out. Look. It's called a business plan. We just need the initial outlay to start the pump flowing and pay it back after the first trip. We do it nice n' easy, you, me, and God willing, Majid. Put that shit away! Why tell me that now? -It's not the right time. -Really? I don't ever wanna hear it, OK? If I get through this alive, I'm out. In two days' time, I'm out. So, get out. I don't give a shit. -Fuck. -It's my idea anyway. -Where will you go? -I dunno. I'll go... with Majid to Phuket and chill. We'll open a bar or a restaurant. -Phuket? -We'll call it Paris-Phuket. What? -For real? -Why not? Paris-Phuket! Phuket. Whoa. Swiss chicks! Is that your thing? Huh? They're not romantics. You'll have to nail 'em like a good stud dog. A real power hammer! Hammer all day long! Huh? Bro! Your needle dick's no good for that. Phuket! With Majid! A-la-la-la-la. Phuket! You won't last two days. Huh? Bro, you're taking "Mommy"! Shut your hole. Don't diss Majid. And get this in your head: You'll never do business with the Moroccans. Look at your face. Your face. Ever looked at it? You're not halal. We'll see about that in three weeks. We sure will. Go on, tell me more. Thinks he's Mr. Big! Three weeks. I'm getting married. What? What are you talking about? Who with? I'm talking to you. Who with? Do I know her? Samia. Sa... Samia Samia? Sam... -Get the grenades. -What? Let's get the grenades out. Leave the grenades where they are. -Sure? -Yeah, I'm sure. Nassim always had them on him. To surprise people. It's always a surprise. Huh? You don't expect it. Nassim was shot to death. -So? -If you put it like that. -He was a great guy. -"Was" is the word! He's ancient history. Your Nassim... is the bravest guy in the cemetery. Stay calm. And in control. Yeah, calm and in control. I prefer jail to a cemetery. Me too. How's your brother? -He'll be out in three months. -Good. He's bearing up? Why wouldn't he? Well, 'cause he's... He's what? Well, he's... -Huh? -Hmm? -He's what? -He's nothing. Nothing. It's a jungle in there, man. Uh, you gotta be... Oh, yeah. I didn't say anything. So, keep saying nothing. Shut up and drive. He'll get a job. I'm not worried about him. Yeah. Can you hear me? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, we'll fill up in ten kilometers. Slow down a bit, then. Stick to 130. Go on. I'm at 130, Imad. Fuck. Good to see you. -It went through? -Yeah. Well. Come on. -Speak French? -Yeah, she's French. Out. Majid won't see Creil again. His Mom shouldn't see him like that. -I said she could go. -You shouldn't have. She can't. Why not? You talk too much. What else does she know? Nothing. Nothing, I swear. It's OK. Save your strength. OK... Either she comes too or you kill her. I can't do that. So, she comes with us. You never saw anything like it, huh? You get in the front. Come on. What do we do with Majid? What can we do? Burn the fucker. My things! Fuck, the coke! Stop! Stop the car! The coke! Fuck! Fuck, the coke! The fuckin' coke! Fuck! Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Coke. -Fuck. -What coke? Seven kilos for the Mahmoudis.

Everyone knows, especially Omar. -Samia doesn't blab. -Yeah, sure! Get off my back. She doesn't. -She left Omar. -He won't leave you alone! He won't do a thing. She was with a cop after him. A cop? -I said... -Enough. You're telling me your fiancée dated a cop? That's very reassuring. Fuck me! You're something else! You're a big shot. You're the boss. You've hit the jackpot, pal. Samia dated a cop! Enough. What now? -Hello? -Fuck me! She dated a cop! Shut your mouth. You're busting my balls. What? Huh? -We're nearly at the border. -Can you hear me? Yeah. How's Majid? He was hit, but he's OK, don't worry. We're all going back in convoy. The men and the gear. No-one. That's good. We went through, easy as pie. -Call you back. -OK. You did right not to tell them. No point getting them worked up. Huh, Imad? -No, no point. -Nope. OK, we'll do that. OK. What did he say? We meet them on the other side. Imad's good, isn't he, Alex? Isn't he? Alex. Alex.

Huh? -Are you serious? -Sure. Fuck... OK, can you imagine... Can you do that? Yes. We have an accident. The car rolls over four times. -A big crash. -Yes. OK? And a grenade explodes. Do you get the idea? I'd rather have the grenades in the trunk than between your balls. Do you get it or should I carry on? I don't get it. -You don't get it? -If we roll over, the grenades aren't the danger. It's more... the gasoline, that's the real danger. What does a grenade do? Nothing. If you don't pull the pin. -I've heard enough. -Right? Does a grenade explode on its own? Stop busting my balls with those grenades! I'm asking you nicely, Reda, stop busting my balls! Stop! Sit up. Keep quiet. A car's following us. Which one? I don't know, but I think one's following us. There's nothing. Honestly, bro. No-one's covering us either. I can tell there's one. Well, you're wrong.

What Gambian? The guy in Malaga. His buyer got busted. He couldn't shift it. We couldn't miss such a good deal. So, I did it before... No, the brothers told me to bring it. What if they tell you to cut your throat? You sort it out with the Mahmoudis. It's your problem, not mine. Majid was right. No, it's gone. Your fuckin' coke went up in smoke! You hear me? Fuckin' jerk! Yacine, take it easy. Hey, take it easy. I need a word. What's going on, huh? You tell us to speed up, now we stop. Chill! We've stopped to wait for Alex. We stop, 'cause we're a team. -How's that? -Don't lecture me! We shouldn't stop here. Just calm down. I'm handling this. -You're not. -Stop it. -You're not handling it. -Yes, I am. You're not handling it! Did you know about that jerk? Wahid! Who? Him. He's changed his name. His chick dated a cop. Shut your mouth. -Who? -Samia. She's his chick. Her ex is a cop.

Hey, we'll fill up in 100 km. I'll go first. Wait for Alex to catch up. Why don't we fill up now? 'Cause you won't reach Creil. At 250, you won't get far on a tank. -Got it? -OK, OK. Yacine...

His brother... -Don't say a word. -He... We mustn't say a word. We gotta make it back to Creil. God willing. God willing. Where is he? -Huh? Where's Majid? -I don't know. Did they leave him there? Do you think they buried him? Sure they did. And they sent for the Imam. I hope the cops found his body. I really hope the cops found his body. There are wild animals down there. Wild animals. They'll eat him. -We're talking about Majid. -Hello? Hello? Yes? OK, got it. We're off. There's no-one there. You're a pain. Huh? What's wrong? Watch the road. Stop looking left and right. You'll twist your neck. Turn around. -See? -Nothing! -He just turned his lights off. -There's nothing. Don't stress me out. Didn't you see the lights go out? I saw the fucker! -I don't like this.

Got good eyesight? Look behind us. See if there isn't a car with no lights on. No, nothing. Yes, the lights are off. Yacine, bro... Elyes, get down. I can't see Alex.

We have to fill up anyway. -See him? -No. -Nadia... -Yes. The key... I'll go for a piss. It's me, Omar. What're you playing at? Why do you keep stopping? Where's the second carrier car? They were to arrive together. They are now. Alex is behind Yacine. Alex is driving the carrier car? We got shot at in Spain, dammit. Majid is dead. Alex took the dope. What's that car following us? Hmm? Yacine saw it and is busting my balls. Wanna fuck it up? I had to calm 'em all down. Wanna get mad at me? You're telling me how to do this? Huh? Remember why you're here? Do you? Yeah. It's me. How's the little fag? Oh, no. The big brother is busting my balls. He's playing the boss. If you've not heard from me in an hour... Listen up! You slit his throat in his cell. Like we said. I'll be in touch. See? If it goes OK, your fag brother can thank you. You'll save his life. Where's Imad? Restroom. This is such a fuckin' mess. Where's Alex? He's checking if we're being followed. That's his job, too. Forget the second. We'll get the first. When he's filled up. Yes. OK, hit me. Make it look good. My pleasure, bitch! Where is he? It's only been three minutes.

Yes, that's it. That damn air conditioning drove me crazy. It made such a racket. We never wanted the night to end. You were so pretty. Like in a dream... No, I'm out of breath, that's all. I've been running. I'm by the sea. There are boats, honey. Docks... A fisherman is taking his boat to... to go fishing. There are lots of birds, too... They're following him. I wish you could see it. Hang on. I have to go now. Are you OK? Yeah. Can I go now? Sure you can. What about you? What'll you do? FAST CONVOY
