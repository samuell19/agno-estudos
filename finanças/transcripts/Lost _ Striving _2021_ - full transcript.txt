DeenTV Sponsors [music] [police radio] In pursuit of suspects, west on Halls road, all units respond... [police radio] That would be a hit and run vehicle... [police radio] I've got a multi-car eastbound multi-car accident with injury [police radio] and then I'm sure I have one vehicle possibly on fire Are you sure you remembered a gas station along this road? I'm positive. Bro, but we've been driving for about 20 minutes now. Yeah, I know. Yah Allah (Dear God), please don't let us run out of gas. [everyone] Ameen. Did we just run out of gas? Yeah. Does anyone have service? I have nothing. No. Hey, wake him up. Hey, wake up. Where are we? Why did we stop? We just ran out of gas. Can you check your phone to see if you have service? Nope. Nothing. My mom wanted me to get there early so I could be with the kids my age at the RAMP retreat. Yeah i know. I don't know how far we are... ...but I tried to go around the standstill and look for a gas station, and yeah... So why do we take a detour in the middle of the boonies with an empty tank? Brother Hanif said that he's been to this area before and he knew that there was a gas station along this road but we've been driving for a while and nothing. Okay guys, so I'm gonna go off for a bit... ...and try to see if i can get service. Usually at higher altitudes the reception is better. You guys stay here and maybe a car will come by. Let me roll with you. Yeah that's cool. Can i come? Bro, just stay with the girls. Let him make up his own mind. Bro, we can't just leave the girls here by themselves though... Yeah like a 12 year old is going to protect us from danger? You know just because we're girls, it doesn't mean that we're helpless. All right, come on, you can come with us... We shouldn't be going long though, I know there's reception out here. I've been here before. Oh and umm I'm going to leave the keys here in case you guys want to roll the windows down or something And there is also water in here if you guys get thirsty Now you guys are free to act dorky... What? Get it? Door-key, dorky... Oh... It's all right, let's go. [music] Any luck? I'm getting absolutely no reception at all... Nah, nothing. I know there is reception out here, I've been here before. What if we find a troll and make it our pet. Get it, pet-troll - petrol What are you like five? Not everything is a joke! I'm just trying to lighten the mood Wait, what is that? What's a fishbowl doing in the middle of nowhere? Hey, maybe someone lives out here. "Do you remember when we rested by the rock and I forgot the fish" - Surah Kahf 18:63. Guys this is a clue. Bro Hanif, what are you talking about? It's a long story, let's just focus on getting service. I like stories. Yeah, you keep saying you've been to this area, you gotta tell us what's been going on now. Okay So do you guys know Dr. Tariq Gilani? The yogurt guy? That's Chobani. Dr. Gilani is a renowned surgeon that did a lot with science and Islam. I actually think he gave a lot of money to the RAMP retreat. Oh yeah, I've heard of him. Yeah so about 5 years back, He created this big treasure hunt that has a one million dollar cash prize, and is right here in these woods. That's pretty cool. Wait, why would someone hide a million dollars here, what if someone bad finds it and uses for... I don't know, drugs or something? Good point. But you gotta see that's where the genius of Dr. Gilani is. All the clues can only be found by knowing both the science and the Quran, So you have to know both in order to find the clues. So you're saying you've been here before? Dozens of times. I got the right coordinates to this exact location, all using references from the Quran. But every time I came here, nothing. That sucks. Bro, there's a spider on your back! Can you get it off? Yeah i'm gonna whack it. No, no, don't kill it just just brush it off. Okay, it's right there. Dude, i think that's a poisonous spider. I should have just killed it. No, I'm glad you didn't. So there's this story of the Prophet Sallahu alayhi wasalaam (peace be upon him) Where he was saved by a spider when he was fleeing Mecca. Okay and... So that's why I don't kill spiders. How did a spider protect the Prophet? I'll tell you guys later. Actually, I think I got a signal. Can you call my mom? Man, this kid is like a baby! No chill. No, I'll call 911 first. Yes, yes. My name is Hanif Wilson, and I ran out of gas off of 85. Location... uh i'm not sure... Do you know what road we were on? Yeah, sorry I don't know. Umm, we ran out of gas over 85 getting around the standstill, and we're on some backroad but now we're in the woods and we just got service. hello... hello... We were in route to the Muslim youth retreat, R.A.M.P. The retreat for American Muslims in the Poconos. hello... hello SubhanAllah (Glory be to God) What happened? Signal's bad We just broke up. "Broke up?" You guys were married? Jamil, you're a clown, man. Why are you praying? What do you mean? Oh no, I just meant like, We all prayed together a few minutes ago. So why are you praying? Well, you can do prayer in a group or by yourself. Well yeah, but obviously prayer didn't work. I mean, as soon as we finished praying, our car ran out of gas. Well yeah, that's true, but you don't just give up and Allah always has a plan for us. But if He already has a plan why, bother asking for anything at all? Well if it's something you really want, then you can't just ask once It's kind of like when we ask our parents, for something you don't just ask once right? Especially if it's something you really want. Actually, yeah, you're right my friends all have like super expensive clothes and stuff, so obviously I asked my parents to give me a Louis Vuitton bag as well, But they kept saying no. Okay And then my dad, he's going through this like crazy religious phase, Because of my brother, who's a mess, but anyways he said that if I come to the RAMP retreat then he would get me the bag. I'm sorry, anyways I used to pray to Allah for stuff, But I stopped. I mean, I'm not a good Muslim. So I doubt He listens to me. Hey, we're all striving to do better, so definitely don't stop trying And look you agreed to go to the RAMP retreat so there you go, that's a big step. But girl, I still want that handbag. Any luck? None. Are you guys checking your phones? Yeah but my battery is low I might have to turn it off. You know back in the past, people didn't need these phones, They would just kind of just look at the ground and know where to go Yeah that's true. I remember when my dad would travel, he would take an actual map, Like a physical map. I think we rely on technology too much, and then when it fails, we're caught here stumbling in the middle of the woods trying to get back to it. That's true. But it's all about how you use it. What do you mean? So before I decided to become a better Muslim, I was subscribed and following all the wrong things. So when I made a decision to be a better Muslim, the first thing I did was unfollow and unsubscribe from all the people that would take me further from Allah. Like bad friends? Yeah and celebrities that just weren't positive. You know how we do Dhikr to remember Allah? Yeah. It's the same motion when we're scrolling on our phones But instead of remembering God it's a dhikr of nonsense. Don't you still have a phone? Yeah. But now it's all dhikr. So I follow a bunch of Muslim speakers, artists, And a bunch of, like, wildlife channels and nature channels. Speaking of wildlife, is that a bear?! Stop playing. He's not playing. It's right over there. I see it. i think it's coming toward us... Run! Dont run, you idiots, if you run, it's going to chase you. Just stay here. Don't make any sudden movements. How are going to get back to the van? It's right in the direction of it. Just wait for it to go away. I'm going to throw a rock at it. Don't throw a rock at a freaking bear! What are you doing are you crazy it's gonna go away eventually, Wait for it to go away, it won't stay here forever [bear grunting] I'm kind of freaking out here Why doesn't this bear just leave? Jamil you asked me about the story with the spider? Yeah... So the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) and Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) They were running away from people that were trying to kill them So they went and hid in a cave Abu Bakr was really scared they would kill the Prophet [bear growling] Go on... To make a long story short, It is said that the spider made a web in front of the cave, So when the attackers got there, It looked like no one had been in. That's amazing. The point trying to make is, They were scared and Allah was with them, and we're scared and Allah is with us. Hey, I think the bear is leaving. Alhamdulillah! (Praise God) Go home bear. Go home! I think we should get back to the van. Yeah before we end up in a situation like that one movie, I forgot the name... The Revenant That was gruesome! Yeah come on let's go. Guys, I think i see a skull. Like a dead person? Duh... nah, nah, that's fake. It's way too small. Either it's fake or it's a kid. Yeah, its plastic "So they went on till they met a boy and he slew him" Surah Kahf, 18:74. This is it guys. This is what? What is it? It's the second clue. Look. Let's go. Okay, so i'm gonna step outside to stretch my legs, Do you want to pray the Dhur? It's probably around that time. Umm, let's just pray later I mean, I don't know. Okay, but I'm trying to make a habit of praying exactly when it comes in, And we need God's help now more than ever. And Allah loves when we pray on time. Yeah, okay well I have to go use the bathroom anyways, so might as well. Okay cool, ummm, do you think brother Hanif would mind if we take two water bottles? He said they were for us, I think we'll be okay What's going on? Everything okay? Hi, no we ran out of gas. Is this your car? No, the driver went out to look for cell service. No there's no cell service around here, though. Oh great. Oh, but I do have a tank of gas from my lawnmower in the back, Let me grab that for you, hold on. Thank you so much! I really appreciate it. So uh, where are you guys headed to? We were headed to the Poconos for a retreat but our driver took this road, to avoid the traffic on the highway. He said he thought there was a gas station down here. No no, there's no gas station around here I mean there was, but not anymore. The only reason I'm on this road is to avoid the big traffic jam up there. Yeah we saw that too. You hear about the police chase and the crash? Yeah we heard on the radio about a chase I didn't know that was a big thing. Yeah they got one guy, but the others escaped. I'm only on this road because the main road was so backed up with traffic. On my way to a job interview, you know. Wow and you still stopped to help us? We really appreciate that. I have 100 bucks, I can go get it. What? No no... I can't accept that. The truth is, I'm doing this for the Lord, you know, I'm hoping He blesses me with this new job. Thank you so much, sir. All right, and you should be good to go. Are you sure we can't offer you some money, just for the gas? No no no, I can't. Actually, if you could do me a favor, I'd really appreciate it, If you could learn about Jesus Christ and what he did for you I'd be mighty grateful. We actually believe in Jesus. What, Muslims believe in Jesus? You are Muslims right? Yeah, we also believe in the Old and New Testament. Look, I know you're in a hurry but if you promise to learn more about Islam, We'll promise to learn more about Jesus (peace be upon him). Okay it's a deal. I'll be honest, I don't really know much about Islam I only know what people around here say. But I'll be honest you guys are the first Muslims I've really ever met, you know... And you all seem like decent folk And you're more than a decent man yourself I hope you get that job. Oh well, thank you. Thank you very much. Have a good day! Thank you, take care, you too. Wow, he wouldn't take my money! Girl i'll take it! So should we wait for the guys to come back? No, can you help me find a spot to use bathroom first? All right let's go. [music] Yo hold up, it's a road The cops might be driving back and forth. Hey looks like maybe hikers or something. Let's go. Dude, I can't believe they left it unlocked! Yo, Frank, Frank... Dude, Frank, you're not gonna believe this, They left the key. We have a car! Let's go! Do we wait for Moe? No man, it's been like three hours since we split up, let's go. Just leave him! Okay, that wasn't too bad. This is a really nice stream. I saw some cool fish in there. Really? You know, you're way different, from all my friends, I mean. Really how so? You're not superficial. You haven't once talked about makeup or anything, I like the way you stood up for Jamil when Waseem was being a jerk. Well, I wear makeup, I just don't obsess about it. And you're so connected, to God, Something I wish I had for myself, and my family, Sometimes, You know, I actually wanted to go to the RAMP retreat, because I wanted God to help my older brother. Is he sick? No. He just hangs out with the worst people, He drinks, he does all these kinds of drugs and, with these girls... I see. My parents give him whatever he wants, but... I know he has a good heart. But his friends, they're turning him into a monster. I used to pray for him but I stopped I mean I'm not a good Muslim, I don't even know how to pray. My parents taught me when I was young but, they don't even pray. They don't pray at all? No. Well my dad suddenly became all religious, Probably because of my brother. He wanted me to go to the RAMP retreat, because I don't know, he thought I would become all religious or something. But I don't even know what to say when I'm praying. It's all in Arabic anyway, so it's not like I feel anything. But you know you can make dua (supplication) in any language. The five prayers are just like what we do to maintain a connection with God. So after you make Salah, just pray in your own words. But why so many prayers, though? It's not really that much like a total of 25 minutes a day, and there are like so many studies why regular prayer helps you physically as well spiritually. Actually, you know, my mom's a chainsmoker, Every couple hours she takes a smoke break. She probably spends more time smoking than you do praying. I don't know I guess it's just how you look at it. I know I spend at least an hour every day on social media, Wake up in the morning, check the phone. Exactly. That's why I try to pray on time, It's like forcing me to prioritize what's really important. That's true. The beauty of Salah (prayer) is that it's also physical, I had a teacher who also taught dance and he saw me praying at school once and said that, the physical movements of our prayer is fascinating! Really? Yeah, even if I don't focus on the words, just the movement itself helps me to connect with God. It's amazing! Wow. Do you want to head back? Do you want to play here or near the car? Let's go back to the car in case the guys come looking back for us. Yeah... True, and maybe they might want to pray with us. Yeah. Do you think you could pray for my brother? Yeah of course. Maybe you can help me get better with my prayers as well. I've just been following along for now because forgot all the words and stuff. Yeah, I can teach you in like an hour. Do you remember the Fatiha? Yeah some of it. You know I'm actually really good at memorizing stuff. I was into K-pop and I had like 10 songs memorized. Wait BTS, TXT or NCT? Girl all three! Don't forget GOT7 What happened?! Where's our van? and why is all this stuff out here? Guys what happened to the van? I'm pretty sure someone stole it Wait, that doesn't make any sense weren't you two supposed to stay by the van? Yeah, and didn't we run out of gas? Listen there was this guy, he came back to help us he gave us gas and we left for five minutes Wow, that wasn't even my van And did they taking anything from the bags? Oh my god, they took all of my money and my snacks What the [obscenity]! Okay, Waseem, now is the worst time for cussing It's just a word Guys, everyone just calm down Waseem, if you could keep from cussing that would be really helpful right now Okay, you know what would have been helpful? If the girls didn't forget to stay by the [obscenity] car and you didn't forget to pull up the [obscenity] gas! Why are you being a jerk? Stop cussing! Again, it's just a word okay and who are you to judge me? You don't even wear the Hijab correctly Excuse me?! What the .... And see you probably cuss too, don't you? Hey, hey, chill out! Waseem! Waseem! Let him go Ahhh... Waseem, you good? There's a freaking snake back there! It's non-venomous. It's harmless Shut it, kid, I don't care I hate snakes, okay! Who's the baby now, huh? hey stop! Stop! Everybody just stop! Everyone just calm down Shaytan's having a field day with us right now Everyone grab your bags we're gonna find a spot away from the road so we can pray Dhur and Asr We need it! And they left the water If you need to make wudu, use that Don't waste it Come on [praying] Asalaamu Alaykum warahmatullah (Peace and mercy of God be upon you) Guys, come in Guys, i'm sorry, Waseem is right I should have got gas before I left I was just packing the tents and all the stuff for the camp and I was scared I was going to be late I should have just stayed on the highway It's okay brother Hanif. One of us should have reminded you about the gas I'm sorry for losing my temper, guys It's okay You know the Prophet said, "Truly patience is at the first stroke of a calamity" So in the first moments when something bad happens that's when patience is most important So let's try to work together and not fight We need everyone's cooperation to figure out what to do I'm sorry guys i'll just try not to cuss around you Actually controlling one's tongue is the first step to self-control. There is a hadith that says "Hell is filled with those people who have the habit of abusing people and using obscene and foul language" maybe that's because people who can't control their tongue have little self-control I never thought about it like that For me it's just about self-expressing Again, I'm sorry if I offended any one of you You should apologize for what you said to Layla Hijab can be so hard for some girls and you're not her parent or her sheikh Sorry Layla I'm sorry for making a mad too, Waseem It's okay, I just hate snakes When I was little I used to act up all the time And my dad had this friend who had this pet boa or python or something One day when I got in trouble at school my dad said he's going to bring that snake to come and eat me And then he showed me this clip of this guy being swallowed whole by a snake The next day when I came home my dad was sitting there in the living room with his friend with this big giant snake That's terrible. What did you do? Nothing. I didn't come out of my room for two days I didn't go to school It wasn't until my mom promised me that there was no snake that I came out Well I bet you didn't misbehave for a while though No that's wrong No parent should ever do that to their kid Yeah, my dad's one of a kind What did you eat that whole time? I don't remember Ii was like five Speaking of something to eat, I'm starving. Anybody have any food left? No. Whoever took the van also took all our food. Jamil... You're the outdoors expert what can we eat out here? Before we do anything, I would say we need to set up camp away from the road and then I have a fishing kit in my backpack from boy scouts and that has matches and a fishing rod in it which we can use to catch fish. Hmmm. Ok. But shouldn't we stay by the road just in case someone drives by Yeah I don't want to see another bear You guys saw a bear?! Yeah that's what took us so long We had to wait on it to leave There are bears around here! Apparently. Since we're here Let's just set up camp around here I have two tents I was gonna take to the retreat so I have one for the sisters and one for the brothers Okay but maybe one of us should stay by the road just in case someone drives by It's a better idea to stay here we can't just set up tents in the middle of the road Okay okay okay Yasmeen, Waseem, Layla Can you guys go get the tents? Yeah And Jamil, let me talk to you for a second Okay... What's up? So one my favorite hadiths says: "Truly none of you believes until he wants for his brother what he wants for himself" Ummm okay So when we give up something we love for the sake of Allah, He blesses it many times over So let's say I have a hundred dollars and I give $50 of it to someone in need How much do I have left? Fifty dollars Kind of... Allah will multiply it many times over So let's say, He rewards you with five hundred dollars or maybe a thousand dollars or maybe A million dollars! That's crazy, wow. Just think about that. Guys, I have something to tell you I have 12 granola bars 12 granola bars that I've been hiding I've been pretty selfish, i'm sorry Oh my god, that's great it's Jamil, Jamil holding out on us Sorry I just really like granola bars and I get hungry a lot, So i just... That's okay man, just pass them over, I'm hungry So I have 12 and there is 5 of us. You guys can take mine. So thats 3 each. Everybody just take one MashaAllah Jamil May Allah reward you for your generosity Yeah may He reward you with infinity granola bars [gun shot] Alright come out now everyone whoever's there Come out right now, let's go Everyone get out of the tent Come on, hands up, let's go Hurry up Come on, I don't have all day Give me your food water and money! Are you the police? Mohamed? What are you doing here? Hanif? You know this guy? Yeah, he's from the masjid Bro what are you doing here? What are you doing here, man? Bro, calm down Just give me the gun I can't do that bro I'm in a lot of trouble Bro, calm down I said I can't do that Listen you're a good kid you don't have to... I'm not a kid, okay Bro whatever it is we can figure it out we just have to put down the gun Like I said, I can't do that, okay man! Mohamed, we prayed together we balled together I know your parents I promise you, Wa Allahi (I swear to God) if you put down the gun we can figure this out together But you got to put down the gun okay okay Mohamed, what's going on man? I didn't mean for anyone hurt okay Who got hurt? It was the crash I shouldn't have gone with them Guys, someone bring me some water Jamil get us some granola bars Talk to me Mohamed You know Zubair? Uh yeah, Brother Lateef's son He's mixed up with some bad dudes We were just hanging out and there were these undercover cops Bro, what are you doing hanging out with Zubair?! You know what he's into I know, okay I know We booked But this man Marcus was going too fast we hit this family, man... There were three kids in the car Oh man bro, why would you run? You're a fugitive now The highway was at a standstill I can't get arrested, man You know what that's gonna do my family? What that's gonna do to me? I'm a Hafidh (memorized entire Qur'an) Bro, I can't go to jail Mohamed you have to stop running and turn yourself into the police Listen you're worried about other people you should be worried about Allah Turn to Him and ask for forgiveness No way man, I think they are still after the other guys, okay They're not gonna catch me We split up yesterday Bro, just calm down, stay with us InshaAllah (God willing) we'll figure it out No man, I got myself into this mess, okay I can get myself out Listen Mohamed, just calm down man just stay with us I'll talk to the police No man don't tell them anything about me okay I just gotta get out of here Wow, this trip just keeps getting crazier and crazier doesn't it? Yeah Look guys we have to figure out what we're going to do for the rest of the day I'm going to try and find some cell phone service Waseem? Can you go by the road? Maybe flag somebody down? Jamil, let's try and get a fishing pole made today alright? We don't know how long we're going to be out here for, guys Can, I make a suggestion? Yeah Okay I think we should split up into two groups You shouldn't go off by yourself in the woods and one person shouldn't be by the road Good point Brother Hanif, I'll go with you my phone still has some juice Maybe, I can pick up some cell phone service Okay, cool. Yasmeen, Layla You guys mind standing by the road? No problem Jamil let's try catch the fish today Okay You guys take care of him Let's go That was crazy! This whole experience has been crazy! Yeah, I know the guy from the masjid and his parents are like super involved in the community That just really goes to show only Allah knows who's better So true You know, after we prayed Fajr (morning prayer) I asked God if He gets us out of this situation I'm going to be a way better Muslim and if He doesn't you'll stay the same? I mean why are we all like that? My dad only got all religious because my brother started going crazy Well, not everyone Like, my parents are super religious but they recently lost their jobs They were both professors and the college that they worked at laid off a bunch of people after the pandemic Oh no... Yeah, we actually couldn't afford to go to the retreat but I wanted to go so badly, so... I talked to brother Hanif and he said someone donated the money for me to go No way You were that girl? What do you mean? Okay okay okay, so... Brother Hanif sent out an email saying that someone in our community couldn't afford to go to the retreat I had all this money that I was saving for that one Louis Vuitton bag I told you about The super cute one... But my dad said that he would get it for me if I went to the retreat anyway so I gave brother Hanif all the money so that the person who couldn't go, could make it wow, I don't know what to say but thank you so much! You literally have no idea how much I wanted to come to the retreat And look, you're already a great Muslim No, I'm not I mean, I don't even pray Look, just focus on prayer and get those regular and keep giving charity The rest will come You know, Waseem was actually right I cuss a lot and I don't know, hijab is really hard I'm only wearing the hijab because we were going to the retreat Yeah hijab can be really hard for me sometimes too Really? Yeah, it can be a real challenge sometimes But I guess it's that's really anything in life faith can't always just be a walk in the park In fact, the more challenging something is the more reward, we get from it But I thought God doesn't want hardship on us Yeah, but things that are tough help us grow Like sometimes school can be tough for me or like exercise So is that why you wear it? Because it's something you'll be rewarded for? Yeah, but also when it comes to modest fashion us Muslim women like own the game! Like we totally set the standard You're right, you know those Amish girls are like, 'Muslim girls got it going on!' Yeah, but it's also not just religious people Modesty is such a universal thing like bravery or honesty And people really respect that Yeah, that's true But like I said before, just focus on your prayer and your connection to Allah first There's an order of importance And just keep being the generous girl that you are Thanks! Guys, look at this stick I found and I already got the string and the hook on it, so can you show me where the stream is? I can't leave Layla here by herself I mean, I can go on my own No way Jamil you can't go off by yourself Okay how about this, I go with him you stay here and watch for cars Sound good? Okay, I guess I'll be back, okay Have fun Hey you want to hear a joke? Uh sure. Where do fish keep their money Where? In river "banks". Okay that was good, that was good You really like telling jokes don't you? I mean it helps me feel better if I'm scared or I feel like someone's gonna hurt me so I make jokes and it helps lighten the mood too Do people hurt you a lot? I mean not physically, but at school... Do you get bullied at school? I used to, a lot But not anymore because people like me because my jokes I mean, that's good but did you tell a teacher or a parent? I did tell my mom but she ended up getting more stressed But like I said people like me now because my jokes Okay, but you should seriously tell an adult that's not okay Well, technically, I am an adult I pray all five of my prayers, so... Wow, I'm glad you're doing that I mean I started praying because one day this kid named Jason was picking on me and my friend Elijah so then I prayed that Allah would punish him for what he did and the next day he wasn't at school and it turned out he got pneumonia and he was out for three weeks Wow, that's that's crazy You know, me and Yasmeen were just talking about me getting better with my prayers My mom always tells me that Allah responds to the prayers of the oppressed I mean, yeah that's true and all but my dad has this new saying trust Allah but also tie your camel, dude yeah my mom says that too Anyways, let's test this thing out Hey, I caught something whoa Oooh, what is that? Well, it's not a fish Yeah, it looks like a toy boat Its in really good condition You know maybe there's like a house or something upstream Can i keep it? Uh, go ahead Actually, I'm gonna go check on Yasmeen you stay here okay, i'll be back Sounds good Hey, is it me or does it seem like we're on a path here? Yeah, I was thinking the same thing Maybe it's like some hikers or or a deer or something It would be pretty cool to run into some hikers though, huh? Not those fugitives though they're definitely on the wrong path Well, to be honest it is hard to stay on the right path Yeah Like, when we were younger for example It was so easy to be a good muslim now it's just so much harder What do you mean by harder? Like back there when you guys were going off on me for cussing I have so many more bigger sins to worry about than just that Bro, I was probably in the same place or even worse before i started practicing Well in that, case there is this one girl... Look bro, I don't want to know about your sins If you've done something haram that's between you and Allah You see, that's why I respect you you've made it past that peer pressure You fought your way through and now look at where you are Yeah. Yeah but honestly, it's so much easier to not get into haram things if you haven't tried them Because when the devil tempts you to try that first joint or have that first beer It's so much harder to get away from it I was just thinking I was gonna party it up and then when I get to your age find me a little honey become religious and settle down Bro, that's not how it works man I still struggle with this stuff, daily. This is a daily struggle And who even said you're gonna make it to my age We might die out here Okay, fine how do I become a better Muslim I don't know, man, like... Start with the little things like have friends that get you closer to Allah You're going to the retreat right? That's a start I was just going to hang out with my cousins Well, are they a good example? I mean most of them are like me we just talk about sports What about your friends at school? Definitely not! Even the coach of my basketball team is into some really sketchy stuff To be honest you're the first real practicing muslim I've ever connected with But then stay in contact with me but you've got a job and you're like married and whatever I'm not married yet but like you know I was thinking about I dunno know, like i mean... Is there someone you like at the retreat? How'd you know? Is it Sister Fatima? How'd you know? Because sister Fatima's awesome, dude Yeah, she is Well, you might have some competition, though Yeah and honestly man, I had to check my intentions, first Because there's this hadith that says All good deeds are judged by your intentions So, if you travel to marry someone you're rewarded for your intentions But I thought marriage is supposed to be a good thing like completing half of your faith, or whatever... yeah it is, but honestly bro, The only reason why I volunteered to drive you guys around for free was to impress her and now look where we're at Maybe if I just did this for the sake of Allah Allah would have just made it easy on me Well, maybe you don't remember me but I remember you You were at my last retreat and you're an awesome guy Yeah, I was a counselor last year but uh my memory is horrible couldn't tell well let's make a deal If you stay in contact with me I promise to start praying all five of my prayers and in each and every single one of those prayers I'll pray that Sister Fatima marries you Wow that's some incentive man You got a deal. We've been walking for hours, man i'm tired My feet are killing me! When was the last time you checked your phone? uh i don't know it's been a while check it check again see where it's at Bro dude, I have bars I have bars too how many? Three, um check your phone Download maps and i'll call 911 yes yes yes we need help we're lost in the woods Yes, my name is Hanif Wilson I'm lost in the woods there's me and four kids We ran out of gas on the side some road and now we're lost in the woods looking for service Four kids with me, it's five of us We got off 85 and we got lost, ran out of gas Someone stole our van, listen, you can get us? Yeah there's a bear out here! Oh thank you! What? Alhamdulillah, Alhamdulillah They said they can get using GPS MashaAllah (by the will of God) Allahu Akbar (God is great) We got service! We got service They're coming to get us Wait, really? That's great! How soon are they coming? About an hour. Where's Jamil and Layla? Layla went to show Jamil the stream so he can catch some fish Okay cool, wait they left you here all alone? Yeah but it's fine, they just went to the stream And Layla's probably on her way back by now All right cool, well Waseem, you stay here with Yasmeen by the road and when Layla gets back make sure you guys stay together Please! Hey hey, Hi All right, look you guys stay here I'm gonna get Jamil, all right? Okay wait, wait, did the cops say anything about what happened to the van? Uh no, why? Okay, because I left my phone in the car I put it in the back seat pocket No way Was it on did you turn it off? No I didn't turn it off Oh okay, wait, so when the cops come back, we can locate your phone and get the van back, right? Wait that's a great idea! All right Allah, I see you looking out for us All right cool, you guys stay here I'm gonna go get Jamil, all right? All right, alright, see you guys! Hey it's great ah, It's good to be home By the way guys, I was talking to Hanif earlier and I saw a lot of errors in my ways For the past two days I've been a big jerk and you know I just, I don't know how to apologize And I just I wanted to make it up to you guys Especially you Layla I was really disrespectful and I'm sorry It's okay we were all stressed and just don't worry about it okay I'm sorry It's fine we all make mistakes but I really appreciate your apology But guys all that matters is that we're finally going home! [phone call from Mom] Catch anything? No fish, but got a boat What? Boat. Let me see Okay No way! Allahu Akbar! (God is great) And so they proceeded until they were in a boat and there was a hole in it, Surah Kahf 18:71 Does that mean we have all the clues now? Not exactly, there's something missing Do you know the story of Khidr and Prophet Musa (Moses) Alayhis Salaam (on them be peace)? Hmmm, I don't think so, yah no. Well in the Qur'an, there's a story where Prophet Musa and Khidr go on a lot of adventures Each of these clues is associated with that story So the fishbowl is from when they first lost their fish Then they put a hole in the boat and then they killed someone Each of these clues is associated with the number Which I should be able to triangulate and find the final clue Let's go! Hold on let me try and calculate it first Look, my phone's about to die can I use yours? Yeah If the calculation is right we're only 900 feet from the final clue Let's go! Come on! It should be around here Do you see anything? That doesn't.... This isn't natural What? No way! No way! SubhanAllah! Is this it? "And as for the wall, it belongs to two orphan boys in the town and there underneath it was a treasure belonging to them" Surah Kahf 18:82. Look, I think it's there, This is the final clue! All right, push! One, Two, Three. Harder! One, Two, Three! All right, grab it! Let's see what Dr. Gilani left us "MashaAllah, you have found the first piece of the treasure... I have placed $1,000 in cash for you as a small prize In order to get the rest of the money you must solve the riddles in the book You must use your knowledge of science and Qur'an to solve the rest You have one month to solve it before the clues will change again May Allah help you in the upcoming journey. Dr. Tariq Gilani Chobani. Maybe he left some yogurt in here. Allahu Akbar (God is great) All right come on, let's go We gotta go take this back to everybody Bro they're gonna be so excited! I know, we can get a new van! Hey guys, I just want to apologize for getting us all into this mess But Allah says he puts us through these tests so that we can get stronger Definitely! Yeah Although He didn't exactly answer our prayers not to run out of gas He definitely had something better planned for us Yeah, yeah I mean, look, we didn't make it to the retreat but we had an adventure that we're gonna remember for the rest of our lives Yeah, thats true Thank you so much brother Haneef for being a great leader out there Yeah, yeah But look, I'm not gonna forget any of you guys Waseem, we gotta stay in touch man Definitely Jamil, great survival skills Yasmeen, Layla, you guys were amazing Alhamdulillah (Praise God) But before we go, I just want to say That we plan, Allah plans, and Allah is the best of planners So if we are ever lost, we have to keep striving to be the best we can be Yep So anybody have anything else to say? May the "Forest" be with you all! He must have been saving that one for a while You guys were having a great conversation, I just wanted to "spruce" it up [laughing] all right, this guy... Spruce! You guys were arguing so much the situation was way "too tense" (two tents) You know what, yeah, I gotta go Why do trees have so many friends? Because they "branch" out. What do trees wear to the swimming pool? Swimming trunks [music] [cellphone ringing] Hello? Yeah this is Brother Hanif Wa'alaykum Salaam. Sister Fatima?
