(Curucu squawking) (intense orchestral music) (woman screaming) (Curucu shrieking) (jug thuds) (Curucu squawking) (man yelling in Portuguese) - El monstro! El monstro's aqui! (yelling in Portuguese) - El monstro's aqui! El monstro! (yelling in Portuguese) (plane engine humming) - Hello, Dean. - Captain Cansares. Where is everybody? - Ah, that's why I called you by shortwave Radio. I'm glad you were able to fly in so fast. - You caught me just in time. I was leaving for Belém. - Observe, Mr. Dean. All your workmen ran away. Nobody's left on the plantation. - Where did they go? - Back to the jungle. I couldn't hold them. Let me show you why. Please step in. (engine revving) (dramatic orchestral music) - Like the others. - Tupanico. What are you doing here? - I heard the terrible news. I guessed you'd be here. This is the monster's fifth victim? - Yes, and as always, the tracks lead from the water and back into the water again. - Observe this, Señor Dean. A beast with claws like that of a giant bird. - A crocodile, perhaps? - A crocodile is no bird. - What animal could it be? - Who knows, Señor? The people who have seen it are dead. And those who haven't believe that it is one of those monsters that lives behind the falls in Curucu. It's a legend. - A legend? Do you expect me to believe that this woman was murdered because of a legend? - Who knows, Señor? I myself doubt that such monsters exist. But though I doubt, I'm not certain that they don't. There are many mysteries in the jungle. No white man has ever been up the river as far as the waterfalls of Curucu. - Well, let's take a look around the plantation. (intense, rhythmic drumming) (singing in foreign language) (jeep approaching) (intense, rhythmic drumming) (singing in foreign language) 4th. - Uh! (speaking in foreign language) - What's he yelling about? What's that dialect? (speaking in foreign language) - He calls on the Indians to leave the plantations and return to the jungle. (speaking in foreign language) - They'll never live in that jungle. They've forgotten how. I better have a talk with them. - Those people are not rational, Señor. (speaking in foreign language) (fist thuds) (crowd chattering) (footsteps thudding) (dramatic orchestral music) (dramatic orchestral music cont.) (dramatic orchestral music cont.) (soft orchestral music) - Hello, Rita. - I'm glad you're here. - How's the, uh, temperature? - They've been in conference for hours waiting for you. - I took off the moment I got your telegram. - Well, I better tell them that you're here. Your son is here. - Send him right in. - How long are you going to be in town? - Hmm. Not long enough for what you're thinking, angel. Sorry I took so long. - It needs a near disaster to bring all of us together. - Señor Guzman. - Hello, Rock. - Señor Carvello. - Hello, Rock. - Good to see you. Hello, Father. - Rock, what is this nonsense about a monster? It's a strike, isn't it? How much do they want? - No, it's not a strike. And it's not a question of money. - It's always a question of money. - The panic is growing. Every plantation along the Amazon's losing its workers. - Can't we stop them? - They're free citizens. If they wanna return to the jungle, we cant stop them. - And what about the government? - The government can't interfere. It's a matter for the local police. The police can investigate murder, but they can't investigate fear. - Well, what do you propose? - Well, somebody has to travel up the Amazon River to the Curucu Falls. - Why there? According to the legend, that's where the monster lives. - There are no monsters. - You know how superstitious these natives are. You lived among them long enough. - Too many years in the jungle can affect any man. - Five people have been murdered. Police believe some animal did it. Natives clam it's a monster. - Monsters that live in the Curucu Falls and come down the river? - Well, it's the only clue we have. That's the reason I wanna go up there and bring those people back. - You're talking suicide. - None of you gentlemen has come up with a better solution. - (sighs) Good luck, my boy. (foreboding orchestral music) - All right, young man. (Rock exhales) That must be expected. - What's to be expected? - Oh, a slight touch of malaria, no importance. We'll get the lab reports in a moment. Miss Romar? - Yes, Dr. Vale? - Get me tetanus, yellow fever and small pox. Half CC each. - Yes, Doctor. - Ah, she's a very capable young woman. - (exhales) Yeah? Well... - Ah, keep your shirt off. You're getting a few shots. - Just in case, you know? From the, uh, capable young woman? Who is she? - American working here during her sabbatical. - Yeah, I know how it is. Can't get a man, so she chooses a career. - Yes, very sad. - Yeah. - The boosters are ready, Dr. Vale. (soft, dramatic orchestral music) - Sit down, Mr. Dean. This is Miss Romar. - How good are you with that needle, Doctor? It's nice to meet a doctor prettier here than Dr. Vale. - How far are you going up the Amazon River? - Well, I figured -- - Don't move. - I'm going all the way up into headhunter country. - I asked you not to move. - Yes, Doctor. As you say, Doctor. - I'll look at those shots in a couple of days. I'll give you a prescription, all right? - I thought you said I was all right, Doc? - Ah, it's a new drug in case that malaria bothers you again. How long will you be away? - Well, I don't know, Doctor. With those Indians, you know.. maybe forever. In fact, the next time you see me, I may be under glass in the Museum of Natural History. - Ah, I wouldn't joke about it, Rock. - Yep. It's gonna be a rough trip, all right. I think a man deserves a last fling, good food, dancing, nice conversation, pleasant company. Miss Romar, how about brightening a man's last evening? - I'd love to, Mr. Dean. You, um...you can pick me up here at seven. - Six months she's worked for me, nobody could date her. And many have tried. (upbeat orchestral music) (upbeat orchestral music cont.) (upbeat orchestral music cont.) - Pretty girl. - Oh, there are six women for every man. Cigarette? - Men seem to be a rare species. I'd say it was the other way around. Six gals for every guy. - Mm-hmm. (matches rattling) - And, uh, am I one of them? (upbeat orchestral music cont.) (upbeat orchestral music cont.) (audience applauding) (indistinct chattering) (soft orchestral music) - Concentrate, will you? - Oh, but I do. - Aren't you interested in my kind of work at all? - Enormously. What is it? - (chuckles) Cancer research that I carry on with Dr. Vale. We discovered that single subcutaneous injections of purified penicillin have no regressional effects at all. - (sighs) It's too bad. May I have the next dance? - I wanna talk to you. - Hello, Rocko. - Hello. - Popular. - Just unmarried. Shall we dance now? - No, now listen to me. The headhunters have a drug that we want. - And what have the headhunters got to do with us? - Well, the headhunters prepare an extract from certain plants which shrink live tissue. - Shrunken heads. - If I can find that preparation, well, medicine would take a giant step. - Well, I'm all for medicine. - You see, it's a drug called koshisin. The headhunters know about this preparation in nonlethal concentration and we don't. - Darling, you have completely enlightened me. (Andrea chuckles) Now, shall we dance? - Hi, Rock. - Oh, hello. - Sit down, join the party. - Well, we got a minute. - Yes. Well, uh -- Oh, Vivian, this is Andrea. Andrea, Vivian. - Charmed. Why didn't you call me? - Oh, I, uh, thought you were in San Paulo. - You can't trust him from here to that champagne glass. Don't get involved and don't fall for his charm. - (chuckles) I'll try not to. - That's what I said when I met him. Gonna call me tomorrow night? - I can't, I'll be out of town. - Really? - We're, um, we're going to the headhunter country. - How nice. Bring me back his shrunken head and... be sure to keep him on short rations, hmm? Bye. (soft orchestral music) - Um, number one? (Rock exhales) - Look, can we dance now? - (chuckles) All right. (soft orchestral music) Are you really going up there alone? - Hardly. I'm, uh, taking a guide from Belém. Excellent man. Tupanico. - Uh, T-U-P-A-N-I-C-O? - That's right. (Andrea chuckles) - I never forget a name once I spell it. - Oh? Spell mine. - Uh, W-O-L-F. (Rock chuckles) (soft orchestral music cont.) - Why won't you take me with you? - Take a white woman through the rainforest? It can't be done. - You give me a reason. It doesn't have to be a good one. - I can think of a lot of places to take a woman. The jungle isn't one of them. - Is that your final decision? - Yeah. What's the matter? - I'm going home. - But Andrea, it's my last night in town. - No, it isn't. You still have a few shots to take. - Oh, have a heart, will ya? - Will you change your mind and take me with you? - But I can take you with me. - Well, goodnight. (soft orchestral music cont.) (triumphant orchestral music) (triumphant orchestral music cont.) - Tupanico. - Señor Dean. How did you get back so soon? - I'm going up the river. - On a monster hunt? Stalk the beast, kill it? (matches rattling) Where would you start to look for it? - Curucu Falls. - No white man has ever been up the river that tar. - That's where you're from, isn't it, Tupanico? Your family lives there. (match striking) - Those of them that are left. Most of them move down to the plantations. Now that they're afraid, they're returning to the land of our fathers. - That pleases you? - Somehow, it does, Señor. I'm a chieftain's son. - (chuckles) In a silk shirt and a sombrero you payed a thousand cruzeiros for? Is this what you want? - Sometimes, I wonder, Señor. - Well, then, why don't you go back? Paint your face, suffer the heat, the hunger, the diseases. Would that be better? - You're right, Señor. I love the silk shirts, good food, and the cruzeiros. - Okay, let's get going. - Going? - Of course. - I'm desolate, Señor. I cannot go with you. - Why? - I have been engaged by the person you sent me. - I sent? - I really am desolate, Señor. It ts the first time in my lite that I work tor a woman. Pretty, but a woman. - (chuckles) Tell her to get someone else. - Suppose you tell her. (soft orchestral music) (Andrea speaking Portuguese language) - Well, hello. Did the injections take? - Why did you steal my guide, Miss Romar? - Well, how formal. It was Andrea in the nightclub. - You're gonna have to get yourself somebody else. I'm taking Tupanico with me. - And Tupanico is leaving with me tonight. There's the boat. - You're a foolish little girl. You're working for me. Understand? - I'm desolate, Señor. It is already decided. - Of course, if you'd like to come along... Let me know if you change your mind! - Señor Dean is a very determined man. (speaking in Portuguese) (soft orchestral music) (indistinct chattering) (dramatic orchestral music) (dramatic orchestral music cont.) (sails squeaking) - Welcome. I thought you'd see it my way. - Well, I couldn't let you go alone. (motor chugging) (soft orchestral music) - Mm-mm. Bad news? - I just got this telegram before I left. - Did it kill again? - Panic. Imagination. Now they see the monster behind every tree. - Rock, the dragon killer. - It isn't funny. Whatever it is, they're running away from it. - And by going to the Curucu Falls, you're gonna solve the riddle and bring them back again. - How else? (motor chugging) (serene orchestral music) (bird shrieking) - Is that where we take to the canoes? - Yes. Tupanico has them waiting. We'll pick up equipment, the porter's a few miles up that tributary. - We'll pass by Father Flaviano's Hospital since we have supplies for him. (dramatic orchestral music) (ominous orchestral music) (wildlife calling) (crocodile growling) - Quiet, isn't it? (crocodile growls and hisses) Are there any fish? - Thousands of them. Every one of them a killer. (soft orchestral music) - Piranha. - I've seen some of those at the aquarium in Rio. Terrible looking things. All teeth. - They can eat the flesh off a man in 60 seconds. (water sloshing) (suspenseful orchestral music) - Rock, lookout! (knife whooshes) (Tupanico speaks in Portuguese) - [Tupanico] Viper, most poisonous. It attacks anything that moves. (water bubbling) - (sighs) Well, I'll get used to it. I'll have to. (suspenseful orchestral music) (water sloshing) (Andrea gasps) (rifle thudding) (crocodile roaring) (Andrea gasps) (rifle cocking) (rifle firing) (water bubbling) - Well, have you had enough? You wanna go back? - No, I'm going on. No matter what. When do we meet the porters? - It's not much farther. Couple of miles, we'll pick up the porters and equipment. (soft orchestral music) (wildlife calling) (dramatic orchestral music) Hold it. (suspenseful orchestral music) (dramatic orchestral music) (wildlife calling) - What are they? - The Terrazaha Tribe. - We'd better go over to them. Come on Andrea. - Me? Why? - If a man's with a woman, he's not looking for trouble. That's what they think. (wildlife calling) - Sure they'll know I'm a woman? - I think so. Walk behind me. Peace. (speaking in foreign language) Woman. (speaking in foreign language) (Andrea gasps) (speaking in foreign language) - They're satisfied that you're a woman, Señora. - Peace, thanks to your attributes. (tribe chattering) (drums pounding) (rattle shaking) The rattle and the drums. Somebody's sick. - Sick? That's my department. - It's no job for a woman. Witch doctor will be offended. He'll lose face. - That's my job. - Wait a minute. - Don't touch the sick man, Señora. Don't. - Fetch my medical kit, Rock! (speaking in foreign language) (drumming and rattling cont.) (wildlife calling) (drumming and rattling cont.) Open my case. (case decks) - Mm! (groaning) - Acute appendicitis. - Are you sure? - I've seen thousands of them. Now, don't be afraid. Here. This isn't gonna hurt. Everything's gonna be all right. Just lie still. - He doesn't understand, Señora. - He understands. (groaning) Tupanico, tell him we're taking the sick man along with us to Father Flaviano's Hospital. - According to Indian custom, you're now responsible for this man's life. - How far is it? - We should be there by nightfall. - If he doesn't die on the way. (suspenseful orchestral music) (machete whacking) (knife whacking) (parrots squawking) - Rock! Wait. - Hold it. Wait a minute. (man groaning) It's all right. - Hurry, hurry! (suspenseful orchestral music cont.) (machete whacking) (triumphant orchestral music) (chickens clucking) (bell tolling) (drums pounding) (tribe chattering) - Father, do we have time for a blood count? - No. - Now, take a deep breath. (inhales) (man inhales and exhales) (exhales) That's right. (man inhales and exhales) Now, don't be afraid. (suspenseful orchestral music) (Curucu snorting) (bushes rustling) (intense orchestral music) (Curucu shrieking) (man screaming) (Curucu shrieking) - His count's all right. - He seems all right to me. Let's get started soon, Rock. - You can't leave here. - Why not? Father Flaviano has enough trained people. He doesn't need me. - You've taken the place of the witch doctor. If you leave him, he'll die. - Is that true, Father? Do I have to stay here 'til Tico is up and around? - He'll recover quickly, thanks to the aroma sin and penicillin you brought. - Well, then, why can't we leave in the morning? - We can't leave. You got us into this. Should have left him to the witch doctor. - And let him die? - Witch doctors know a few tricks, too. - Father Flaviano, (yells in Portuguese)! El monstro, Curucu! (yells in Portuguese) (speaking in Portuguese) - Jusay! Jusay! What kind of animal killed Jusay? - The Curucu monster, Padre. - Superstitions, devil worship! I thought you were brought up as a Christian, Tupanico? Monsters. - What else could it be, Padre? - There's the evidence. - Yes, there's the evidence of the Devil. - You know the legend of the Curucu monster, Padre? It descends from the falls to punish the people who deserted the lands of their fathers. - Yes, I know the legends of devil worship and voodoo. That's why I live here in the jungle. Bring light to this darkness. Let's pray for light. Come with me, my children. - Give me the gun, Tupanico. - Would you go out now in the dark, Señor? (rifle cocks) Señora. - Yes, what is it? - The monster. It was here. Señor Dean is looking for it. He took the heavy rifle. - You let him go? - How could I hold him back, Señora? (Andrea sighs) (suspenseful orchestral music) - Rock? Rock? Rock, where are you? (suspenseful music cont.) (bushes rustling) (intense orchestral music) Rock! Rock! Rock! (Andrea screaming) - Andrea! Andrea! (Andrea whimpering) Andrea! - Oh, Rock. (soft, dramatic orchestral music) (Andrea cries) - Let's go back to the house. - An interesting theory. Very interesting, in fact. And so obvious, I never thought of it. - Can you get some of this, uh, headhunter preparation from one of your friends, Padre? Would save her a trip to the falls. - How about it, Tupanico? - Only chiefs and witch doctors know the secret. - You're the son of a chieftain. - I make an agreement with you, Señora. I take her to my tribe, I get her the formula, if it's at all possible. - Well, I see our teachings are taking root. You're talking like a Christian, Tupanico. - That's true, Father. It was here that I learned about heaven. (speaking in Portuguese) (rattles shaking) - Indians? (rattling continues) (speaking in Portuguese) - He's making you a present of the knife. - Oh, thank you. Thank you very much, Tico. - It's a sacrificial knife. The headhunters use those. - Since you've accepted his gift, he's your slave from now on. - Oh, that's charming. What am I going to do with a slave? Thank you, anyway, T -- - Don't reject this. Be in real trouble. (man grunts) (rattles shaking) - Tico! - You can't hold him if he wants to go, Miss Romar. - We've seen the last of him. Let's get started. - I'm ready. (dramatic orchestral music) - Wild buffalo. Wild buffalo! Run for the trees! (buffalo stampeding) Up there, quick! (intense orchestral music) - (panting) That was close. - Yeah. When they start running, nothing can stop them. (intense orchestral music cont.) - Wait, Rock. Look. (snake hissing) How terrible. - In the jungle, anything can happen. (animal squeaking) (snake hissing) (snake hissing) (animal squeaking) (dramatic orchestral music) - What a horrible sight. - Mm-hmm. We'll camp by the river. (dramatic orchestral music cont.) - Well, hello there. Are you going up or coming down? (soft orchestral music) Hello, sweetie. Aw. (cub meowing) (kisses) Ouch! (chuckles) All right, on you go. (animal squeaking) Hmm. (laughing) (fire crackling) (soft orchestral music) - Decent? - Count to 10 and then enter. - One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. Here. Hot. Well, charming. Ooh! That's one use for a gun. - It's certainly fast on the count. - Those pots were hot, they were burning my fingers. Hungry? - Starved. I was going to open a can of beef and beans. - Oh, this is much better. - Well, I set the table. I made some mate tea. (chuckles) That is, if you like mate. - Crazy about it. Usually take it with a shot of cachaca. - Cachaca? That's 80% alcohol. - That's right, doctor. - Well, I'll eat and I'll ask questions later. - Well, just eat. Go ahead, eat. - What is it? - Lizard. Iguana. Bake like a pig on hot stones. - (chuckles) Well, I've eaten just about everything. Kangaroo tails, grasshopper, scotch haggis, rattlesnake. That's new to me. (soft orchestral music) - And this, huh. This tastes like peanut. - Black ants. Red ants are too spicy. - Well, if it moves, eat it. If it doesn't, bury it. - You're not afraid of anything, are you? - (chuckles) Of course I'm afraid of some things, I'm a woman. - Yeah. That's what I keep telling myself. - The Indians seem to think so. (suspenseful orchestral music) - You know, if you were wearing an evening dress, I might... Well, I only make passes. - Oh. That's a compulsion you have. Did you ever see a psychiatrist? (dramatic orchestral music) - Well, you look like a woman. (hand whacks) (suspenseful orchestral music) (gun fires) Sorry I startled you. Didn't have time to warn you. - Thanks. - A quick eye. (rifle racks) I better clean this. - I'll clean it myself. - It's a beautiful gun, Señor. Never misses its mark. (yelling in Portuguese) - Curucu! Curucu! For real! El monstro! (dramatic orchestral music) - Look, there. - What is it? - The monster. (rifle cocks) (intense orchestral music) (gun firing) It's heading down river fast. (speaking in Portuguese) - Get in there and calm them down. - Si, Señor. (speaking in Portuguese) - What do you think it was? - I don't know. - Looked like a giant river serpent. Huh. Seems like anythings possible in this part of the Amazon. - I don't believe in snakes a hundred feet long. Not even in the Amazon. - That was no hallucination. - Might have been anything. It could have been a school of luminous fish. - Señor Dean! The porters refuse to go on. - (sighs) Offer them some more money. - It's no use. - I'll talk to 'em. (porters yelling in Portuguese) (50th grunting) (bodies thud) (fist thuds) - Uh! - (breathes heavily) You're not one of the porters. I know you. You're the one that attacked me at the voodoo dance. (Rock panting) Well, that's that. - They'll be more frightened on their own. They'll come back to us. - Don't bet on it. - Señor, the falls about one day's journey away from here. - We're starting back tomorrow. - Now, wait just a minute. - We're going back. - You can, I'm going on ahead. - At the falls, Señor, we will find other porters. - No. - I'm glad of your decision to go ahead, Señora. I will continue to guide for your orders. (suspenseful orchestral music) (wildlife calling) (tent rustling) (chicken clucking) (soft orchestral music) (suspenseful orchestral music) (Curucu squawking softly) (Curucu shrieking) (Andrea screaming) (intense orchestral music) (rifle cocks) (Curucu shrieking) (rifle clicks) (Curucu snarling) (rifle thuds) (intense music cont.) (bushes rustling) (soft orchestral music) (dramatic orchestral music) - This is what I was telling you about. - Feathers, bones and teeth. - Claws like razors. - In Africa, the headhunters, they use claws for murder. Why? Why is Tupanico doing this? - I don't know. I thought I knew him, but I don't. I knew his voice, his face. Thais all. He even put blanks in my gun. That's the reason he insisted on cleaning it. - What about the monster in the river? - Tupanico's been around. He could have picked up a trick like that. - Trick? - Might have been meta\ powder and water, something. Who knows? He brought us here for a purpose. But why? (bird shrieking) (tribe yelping) (Andrea screaming) (intense orchestral music) (dramatic orchestral music) (dramatic orchestral music cont.) (dramatic orchestral music cont.) (falls rushing) (dramatic orchestral music cont.) (dramatic orchestral music cont.) (dramatic orchestral music cont.) (drums pounding) - It doesn't seem possible. Headhunters. The white girl and the brave hunter. - We'll get outta here. (Andrea chuckles) - How? The West Calvary? (drumming cont.) Well, you tried to tell me. I was so smart. I don't know what I was doing. Flaw (Andrea breathes uneasily) - When I was in the -- when I was in the sixth grade, I read a book about the Amazon. They had pictures of a tribe named the Humachumik. The people had beautiful names, like Moydine, Juanamali. (sighs) Now, here I am. (drumming continues) (drumming cont.) (drumming cont.) (drumming cont.) (drumming cont.) (drumming cont.) - Very interesting, Tupanico. (Tupanico yells in foreign language) - I'm sorry I can't ofter you both a chair. My tribe doesn't know how to weave chairs. - I suppose it won't do any good to tell you that you'll probably spend the rest of your life behind bars. - Before they can put me behind bars, they have to catch me. My name is Tupanico. Do you know what "Tupan" means in our language? It means God. They wouldn't dare to put a God behind bars. - You're not a God, Tupanico. - Under your laws, perhaps. - The missions raised you as a Christian. Now look at you. Black voodoo, snake dances, skulls. You've gone insane, Tupanico. - I'm not insane. For years, I have listened to the white man in the hopes of learning things. (Tupanico breathes deeply) Here's your preparation, your secret formula that you were looking for. It's yours. You see, I also am a humanitarian and idealist. I also want to make people happy. - By slaughtering them? - Thirty years ago, Colonel Forcet tried to reach the falls. He never returned. If you both disappear now, maybe we will be left alone for another 30 years. We don't want your civilization. Have you ever heard of a jungle man who had heart trouble or ulcers? Have you ever heard of one who was frustrated or unhappy? - I can see the happy faces on those heads! - It has taken me 10 years to get my people back to the jungle. No longer will the plantations swallow them up, ruin them with alcohol and money. (intense orchestral music) (man groans) Thousands of our people have died. For the sake of their civilization. (intense orchestral music cont.) (arrows whooshing) (tribesmen screaming) (intense orchestral music cont.) - Run, Andrea! Get out of here! (man screaming) (man screaming) (tribesmen yelling) (men grunting) They look like Tico's tribe. (intense orchestral music cont.) (fire crackling) If they found out we've escaped, they'll be after us like a pack of mad men. (intense orchestral music cont.) (dramatic orchestral music) (dramatic orchestral music cont.) (soft orchestral music) Come on, get up! You've got to! - I can't. One minute. (both panting) (suspenseful orchestral music) (soft orchestral music) - Here, here, drink this. (suspenseful orchestral music) - What is it? - There isn't time to ask. Come on, come on! (suspenseful orchestral music cont.) (man screaming) - Rock, lookout! (Rock grunting) (man screaming) (Thuds) (water splashes) (intense orchestral music) (water bubbling) (soft dramatic music) (soft dramatic music cont.) (soft orchestral music) (machete whacking) (soft orchestral music cont.) (snake hissing) (machete whacking) (leopard growling) (intense orchestral music) (Andrea gasps) (leopard snarling) (dramatic orchestral music) (boar snorting) (animal squeaking) (dramatic orchestral music cont.) (Andrea screaming) (snake snarls) Rock! Rock! Help me! Rock! (Andrea gasping) (Andrea screaming) (intense orchestral music) (dramatic orchestral music) (Andrea screaming and sobbing) (dramatic music cont.) (soft dramatic music) (thunder rumbling) - Lie down here. - I'm so tired. (rain pattering) (lightning striking) - I better find some food. - No, no, don't go. (lightning striking) (lightning striking) (intense orchestral music) (lightning striking) (Andrea screaming) (Andrea sobbing) (dramatic orchestral music) - What's the matter? - Oh, I... I guess I was dreaming. (dramatic orchestral music) (lightning striking) (rain pattering) (monkey squeaking) - Hey, hey! Thanks. (soft orchestral music) (intense orchestral music) (gasping) Rock! Rock! (Thuds) (soft orchestral music) Father, the Indian. - The Indians have brought you here. Tico and his men. - What, Tico?. He and young Dean brought you here. You were a sorry sight. Your clothes all torn. You slept for 48 hours. - 48 Hours? - Relax, my child. - Oh, don't look at me. I must look a mess. - Absolutely hideous. (suspenseful orchestral music) (door creaking) (Tico speaking in foreign language) - He's brought you another present. - Oh, thank you. (Tico speaking in foreign language) - Oh. It's the formula. Tupanico had it in his hut. - He took it from the hut during the fire. - Oh. (Tico speaking in foreign language) Oh. (Tico speaking in foreign language) (suspenseful orchestral music) (Andrea gasps) - Tupanico. (dramatic orchestral music)
