MAN ON RADIO: T5447, roger six. MAN: Whoo! Behind this one building over there. Sir, sir! I got a souvenir for you! Yeah, yeah. Hey, hey! Give me the flame thrower. What you got? There you go, sir. -Come to me. Come to me! Over this way. -On my way. -KAMINSKI: Golikov, come on over here. -Coming! Bring that cyanide canister. Where's the extra satchel? Bring 'em over here.

(ANGRY GRUNTING) Put him under the track. KAMINSKI: Get your feet under there. Do you want me to kick him? You think you can kill my fucking friends and get away with it? Koverchenko, mount and crank it up. We're gonna squash you like a grape. Ask him where the other rebels are. (SPEAKING IN NATIVE LANGUAGE) What did he say? He does not know, sir. (YELLING) Tell 'em to stop! (GUNFIRE) (SCREAMS) (GRUNTS) Bitch! (SPITS) Sir, these women... These women, sir, they humbly beg you for the prisoner, sir. (SHERINA SHOUTING) You tell them to watch what happens to rebels. (SHERINA SHOUTING) Do it, Koverchenko. (GEARS SHIFTING) Forward! (CRYING) Forward! KOVERCHENKO ON RADIO: Directions, sir?

MAN: Come in, base. T5447. -Haven't seen 'em since the village. -I can't seem to raise them. Hey! Come on! Sir! Sir? Where the hell are we? I don't know, sir. -How do we get to the Kandahar Road? -I'm not sure, sir. The Molotov took our radio out. We get reception, but no transmission, sir. Those hills must be here. Kandahar Road must be on the other side of those hills, right? I'm not sure, sir. The garrison grid coordinates are 31 degrees latitude... Samad, you're relieved of your post. -Give the log book to Koverchenko. -For what reason, sir? Incompetence. Record it, Koverchenko. -Then what is my function, sir? -None. -Give yourself a battlefield commendation, Koverchenko. -For what, sir? Trying to save those tankers. -Check this side out, Kaminski. -To your post! Hey, where are you? Just say, "Yes, sir" and keep out of his way. Okay. Why did that rebel we ran over laugh at me? He wasn't laughing at you. He was happy. Such men believe if they die in a holy war, they will go to paradise. You believe that? After university, I'm not sure what I believe. (ROCK MUSIC PLAYING) (GRUNTS) I need a woman! -Maybe you'll find another sheep. -Maybe I will. DASKAL: Kaminski, turn that music off. Golikov put it on, sir. Shit! Come here for a second. I got something to show you. Driver, back it up! (GUNSHOTS) Troops on the ridge! Turret power! Range: 3-0-0! (GUNSHOTS) -At my command! -What's around? What's around? Get it out of here! -Ready to roll. -Driver, forward. Go, go, go! Frag! Head's up, Samad. Traversing! (GRUNTS) Up! Fire! On the way. Ohh! (ALL SHOUTING) Moustafa! Moustafa! Moustafa! (COCKS GUN) (GUNSHOT) (SHOUTS WARNING) (GAGGING) (MOANS) Only one drank the water, God damn it! Samad! I told you to throw that canister far away. They found it! At my command, gunner, frag. Come on. Move, move. Move it! Frag is up. Fire. On the way. (CLICKS) Misfire. Go to manual. Misfire. Out of the tank! -What happened? -Misfire. KAMINSKI: It's gonna blow. I know it's gonna blow. The shell looked okay to me. -Samad. -Yes, sir. Did you touch that shell? Yes, sir. I just handed it. I handed it to Golikov, sir, that's all. Misfires happen, sir. One in every hundred rounds. Cook-off. It's the loader's responsibility to unload. -Golikov. -Sir. Sir, I've never handled a cook-off before. I will do it, sir. He doesn't know what he's doing, sir. Let me go in there. All right. Kaminski. Sir? Pinpoint the mujas. Yes, sir. -Don't take your eyes off of them. -Yes, sir. -Koverchenko. -Golikov. (DASKAL WHISPERING) (METAL CLANGING) Sir, maybe I oughta do this. What if something happens? Then Kaminski will have his first command. Just tell me one thing, Koverchenko. Why do you stick up for the Afghan? 'Cause he's doing the best he can, sir. That's what worries me. (GASPS) You've got what it takes, Koverchenko. I've seen it. Just keep your head on straight. SAMAD: Why don't we just turn and fight the rebels? 'Cause they could put a fuckin' hole right through us with that RPG. Come on. Go, go. (WHISPERING) Come on. Come on. What the hell happened? They're gone, sir. Lucky bastards don't know Samad just saved their lives. I didn't do anything. Booby-trap that round. Yes, sir. Come on. Driver, crank it up. (TANK ENGINE STARTS) DASKAL: Get us out of here, Koverchenko. Moving tank. (MEN TALKING) (ALL SHOUTING) (COUGHING) (BARKING) (WOMAN SHOUTING) (HOWLING) (SPEAKING NATIVE LANGUAGE) (CHATTERING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) (CHANTING) Build a fire, sir? Oh, I'm sure you lost those muja, fuck, sir. Tend to the track, Kaminski. You got it, sir. Oh, God. Let me hit that thing. It is called pakhtunali. It's the code of honor. Pakhtunali. Three obligations. First, milmastia, hospitality. Milmastia. Second, badal, revenge. Badal. Third, nanawatai, the obligation to give, um, sanctuary to all those who ask. To all? All. Even the enemy? All. What if I kill your brother, and you come for badal, revenge, and I ask for, uh, nanawatai? Then I would be obligated to feed, clothe and protect you. That's incredibly civilized. What is it, nanawatai? Nana-watai. Nana-watai. Bread? Koor wadan. (CHUCKLES) KAMINSKI: Smells like... (MUTTERS) When we get back, you gotta transfer out of this tank. I will win his respect in time. Listen to me. When the old man gets on your back, there's no way to shake him off. My dear Konstantin, I regard this abuse as the price I must pay to learn. I love Afghanistan, but we are a flea in the tail of a bear. We must join the 20th century. And when Afghans accept that, I will be there, knowing technology and Russian. So you're a patriot? Yes. Well, so was that rebel. He wanted to keep things the way they've always been. I wish I believed in something that much. I envy him. Then why did you crush him? Because I had no choice. -You always have a choice. -Give it, Kaminski! You never told me she sent you nudes of herself. Give it to me, Kaminski. Whoa, she's got that nympho look. Well, I got the half I want. (CHUCKLES) (GOLIKOV GRUNTING) (KAMINSKI CACKLING) Ah, you son of a bitch! Back off me! Okay. Okay. Huh? -DASKAL: What the hell is going on? -Nothing, sir. Thanks, Konstantin. What is this? Brake fluid? No wonder they don't work. Keeps me steady on the guns, sir. I filter it through bread, you know, to get out all the shit. And then I put in raisins and sugar and I put it out in the sun. And it ferments in a couple days and gets a pretty good kick. (GRUNTS) Write him up, sir? Get over here. For one mistake? He's the best gunner in the division. Omit it. It's already done, sir, in ink. You know, you better watch your ass from now on, Koverchenko. Sometimes Afghan snipers pick off tank drivers. Sometimes tank drivers pick them off first, Kaminski. Really? Grenade! (GUNFIRE) Get down! Where are they? Grenade! -(SCREAMING) -Are you all right, Golikov? -Open the hatch! -I'm gettin' fucking slaughtered down here! KOVERCHENKO: Open the hatch! GOLIKOV: I'm bleeding! I'm bleeding! -Inside! -Get inside. Get in the tank. Hurry up! DASKAL: Koverchenko, get us the hell outta here! GOLIKOV: Hurry up! We've got a fire on top! I'm dying! I can't see! I'm dying! Hard right! DASKAL: Gunner, traverse right 180! I'm dying! Samad, extinguisher! Traversing! I can't see through the fire, sir! DASKAL: Gunner, identify! We have a fire on our campsite! (MEN YELLING IN ARABIC) (AFGHANI REBELS TALKING) (MUMBLED WHISPER) They must have camels or something. That's gotta be how they're keeping up. I can't believe how bad they want this tank. They just keep coming... Shut up. How much longer are we gonna stay here, sir? Until first light, when we can see where we're going. -Crank the head, sir? -No. Sir, I have to take a piss. Hold it. Do you have any water, Samad? All the canteens were left behind. All the rations, too. Great. Your pals will feast tonight. We don't need food and water. We're safe in here. My tanks have been hit by everything. In Mongolia once, RPG. Direct hit. Commander, gunner, and turret went flying. (CHUCKLING) I drove the rest of the tank back to our lines. These tanks today are better. Much better. Sir, I don't think I can hold it much longer. Sir! Sir! -How many? -Twenty, 25, I don't know. They're all around us. Battle stations. Wait a minute, I don't think they see us. By the way they're moving, I don't think they see us. Sir, they're in effective RPG range. Wait a minute, wait a... Troops, frag. Frag is up, sir. -Identify. -I can't identify, sir. It's too dark. Go to IR. IR is busted! They're all around us, sir. Standby to traverse left, 360. All weapons, fire at my command. -Traverse. -Fire! (HEAVY ARTILLERY FIRE) (SHOUTING) Cease fire! Cease fire! All dead, sir. -Samad. -Sir? Go verify. -Move it! -Yes, sir. (GUN COCKING) (GRUNTS (GUNFIRE) Kaminski, stand down. Koverchenko, get on the COIN. Set Samad in your sights. What? Take him now, he's a traitor. Are you insane? Your insubordination has gotten you demoted from intelligence, to rescue operations, to this tank. Your next stop is prison. With a record like that, I wouldn't disobey another order. Take Samad, now. No. How many dead? It's deer, sir. It's a herd of deer! We're leaking oil, sir. DASKAL: Raise the snorkel and seal the cannon. Did we run out of water, sir? There are rebels behind us, and they're following our tracks. Samad, stop it. I'm in my prayers, sir. Get up. Sir. If I'm able to reconcile dialectical material as a man to Allah, isn't that my business? Why do you not trust me, sir? You know I'm a member of the party. My son is in the cultural exchange in Moscow, sir. Do you think I would compromise my son? I said, get up. See how deep the river is. How, sir? Walk in it. You don't need that. (ZIPPER BEING PULLED UP) Like ice, sir. I didn't ask for the temperature. Is the bottom mud or stone? Stone. (GUNSHOT) No! Why? I said, why! Shut up! What are you doing? Recording this, sir. Write yourself up! Because this time your insubordination is going to get you a court martial. So will killing your own men, sir! If you were commander, you would have done the same thing. Samad was waiting for his chance to deliver this tank to the enemy. I was too smart for him. And I didn't study philosophy. You know, I read your dossier, Mr. Intellectual. What would you say your record says about you? That I think for myself. You think for yourself. When I was eight years old, defending Stalingrad, I didn't think for myself. When the motherland asked for our lives, we gave. My father didn't think of himself, he gave. My mother didn't think of herself, she gave! My brother didn't think of himself, he gave! My comrades tied a rope around my waist and lowered me on top of Nazi tanks. I stuffed Molotovs under, under turret and cannon and, and... And they pulled me up again! Eight years old! They called me Tank Boy. I took a lot of Nazi tanks. A lot. And over the years, I've learned to smell a traitor. How bad is it? You mean the tank? Konstantin, do you think he snapped, huh? Hey, hey. What are you doing? -What? -You wanna be next? Do not be seen talking to this asshole. How much further can we go? Not far enough. We should just ditch this bitch. Dismantle the dodge gun and fucking walk to Kandahar. What are you whispering about? Kaminski had an interesting idea, sir. Ditching the tank and walking back. He's a fucking liar, sir. As a man who thinks for himself, Koverchenko, what do you think of that idea? Well, sir. The rear wheel is cracked. Kaminski drank our brakes. We're low on petrol. The battery's low. We're losing oil. If the engine heats up, it's going to seize. Train? Obviously against us. We have no rations. The mujas behind us don't seem to run on rations, petrol, or anything we know of. And, they have an RPG. Their aim is getting better, sir. You admire them, don't you? Well, they got us on the run, don't they? Well, what do you suggest? Surrender? Clearly, sir, that's a direct violation of Soviet military law. You're all for it, aren't you? That's mutiny, Koverchenko. Try it! Kaminski, get his weapon. Cover him. Yes, sir. Golikov, get some rope. Golikov! Now! Tie him to that rock! I'll haunt you, Kaminski! I'll be your worst nightmare! Shut up. You hear me? You're an idiot! KAMINSKI: I can't believe this. Just hold still, asshole. Kaminski, what are we doing? You shut up! He fucking stepped in this one himself. You're a fucking lackey. Fuck. Get the log book! Yes, sir. He doesn't have it, sir. He must have left it in the tank. Booby trap him. Yes, sir. Twisted insanity. Don't be an idiot. Don't move. You need anything... just nod. Konstantin, I'm sorry. Anthony... Anthony, you're next. You go back to that tank and blow his brains out. Come back and untie me. -Golikov! -You're next. -I can't. -You hear me, Anthony? -Golikov! -Anthony. Don't leave me here, Anthony. -Anthony, don't leave me. -I can't! Untie me, Anthony! Ha, good soldier, Anthony. You gonna be counted on when they ask you to shoot your mother? Golikov! God damn it! Anthony. Gol... Golikov! Don't leave me here, you coward! Golikov, you fuck! Arg, Golikov! I think you did the right thing, sir. I appreciate that, Kaminski. And I think I speak for all of us when I say that. What he wrote in here could close doors for the rest of your lives. I don't know why you didn't just kill him, sir. I was trying to buy us some time. Whew. (CLEARS THROAT) Tank's roomier now, sir. (YELPING) (GROWLING) (EXPLOSION) There it is! Kandahar Road! Whoo-hoo-hoo! Ahhh! Haha! Sir! We're almost out of petrol, sir. Make it to the road. Yes, sir. -Yeah! -Stop tank! -What? -Stop tank! Stop tank! I'm sure I can make it, it's only... (WOMEN CHATTERING) Wait... (WOMEN YELLING) Ow! Stop! Stop! Ah! Jesus! Please stop! Stop! Nanawatai! (GUNSHOT) (REBELS YELLING) Nanawatai. Nanawatai. Nanawatai. No, don't. No! Nanawatai. It's a RPG. -RPG. -Yeah. It's kaput. Kaput. Fix? Fix. Fix. I fix. -Kaput. -Kaput? Enfield? Enfield? I need Enfield to fix the RPG. (REBELS MURMURING) Kaboom. (ALL REBELS) Kaboom! -Kaboom. -Exactly. (MAKING MOTOR NOISES) It's a tank. -Tank? -Yeah, tank. Tank. RPG. Kaboom. Tank. Yeah. RPG kaboom tank. Ta. RPG. Kaboom. Tank. Ta kaboom tank. Yeah, I'll kaboom tank. (HELICOPTER WHIRRING) Hey! Hey! Whoo-hoo! Hey, hey, hey! (LAUGHING) Hey! Come on, man! Come on! Get your stuff! Let's go! Woo! Hey, you guys! Where'd you guys come from? It's beautiful! Oh, my God! (LAUGHING) Looks like it's your lucky day. If we hadn't been looking for water, we'd have never found you guys. Boy are we glad you did! Go ahead and climb aboard. I'll call in for a strike on the tank. Nobody wastes my tank. Ya ha-ha! Whoa! Ha-ha! Yeah! Okay! Get back in the tank. What for? Because I said so. We're going home, sir. Yes. In the tank. Why can't we go home in the fucking helicopter? Because you're tankers. Yeah, and you're also in a cul-de-sac. There's only one way out of this valley. Back through that pass you came through. We'll get back the same way we got in. -Hey, listen. You got any extra water? -No. You two. Load the extra fuel on to the tank. Radio for some more fuel to meet us at the pass. Jesus, what an asshole. What are we doing? Why don't we make a run for it? Are you fucking crazy? He'd shoot us right out of the sky. (SAYS ARABIC WORD) What? What? Tank. Yeah, I know. -What? -Tank. Tank. Tank. (MAKING MOTOR NOISES) (REBELS LAUGHING) It's a dead end. It's a dead end. The pass? He's going to the pass. But why? Why's he going to the pass? Why didn't he get in the helicopter? Bastard won't leave his tank. Fucking bastard won't leave his tank. Tank! Tank! He's gone. He's gone. Mountain. Tank. Mountains. (MAKING MOTOR NOISES) Into the mountains. He has to go around. He's got to go around to get to the pass. Tank. Tank! You know a shortcut? You know a shortcut! Tank! I understand. I understand! Konstantin. Konstantin. Konstantin. Konstantin? Konstantin! -Yes. -Hi, Konstantin. Khan. Sir, the engine's hot. Maintain 20 kilometers an hour. Sir, the radiator needs water. Keep going. God damn it, sir. The engine's gonna seize up! Keep going. The water hole's not far. You think they radioed back? Of course they did. I hate this fucking country. Fill the radiator. Kaminski! Golikov! Battle stations! Mujahideen, 4,000 meters! Crank it up! Approaching left! Come on, man. Come on, come on. Give me power to the turret! Shit! I can't, sir! She won't start! Go to master battery! Shit! The battery's dead, sir! (HEAVY MACHINE GUN FIRE) Get us out of here! I'm trying, sir! It's overheating! Manual traverse left! Gunner! Frag! We're out of frags, sir! Anything! I got it heating up! -Damn it. -Come on! On the ready! Spread out! Spread out! Fuck! On the ready! They're in RPG range, sir! Come on! I got it, sir! (REBELS CHEERING) Khan! Khan! Kaput! Now! Now! (EXPLOSION) No! This way. This way! Shit! Get down! We're too high! Too high! Come on you son of a bitch, come on! I can't get elevation, he knows it. You're mine! Keep 'em coming! Last round, sir! Reload! We're out! She's burning up, sir! Make it to the pass, Kaminski! (YELLS) Hurry! Down! Now! Now! Sir! Rocket! I need the rocket! Khan! Rocket! Throw! Throw! Sir! The pass is directly ahead! 100 meters! Faster, Kaminski! Yes, sir! Badal. It only hit the muzzle! (LAUGHING) We made it, sir! We made it! (SCREAMING) Grenade! We're off the track, sir. Oh, God. Make a run for it, sir? No. Ground troops are coming. We're safe in here. (SCREAMING) Hold it! Tank Boy! I said, Tank Boy! -Huh? -I got something for you Tank Boy! Koverchenko! (LAUGHING) Kind of hot in there, huh, Tank Boy! Sir, they got us! Oh, shit! We gotta go up! We're gonna die in here! KOVERCHENKO: Tank Boy! (COUGHING) I want you, Tank Boy! Ah! Shit! (REBEL YELLING) You know our standing orders? What? Out of commission, become a pillbox. Out of ammo, become a bunker. Out of time, become heroes. You must be out of your fucking mind. Now, together. (YELLING) (MEN FIGHTING) Get the pin! (DASKAL YELLING) We're gonna die in here! Golikov. You son of a bitch! Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Son of a bitch, get out! Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Take, take, take the knife. Konstantin, I didn't want to leave you out there. Just, just take Daskal and let us go. Please don't let them kill me, Konstantin, please. Get up. (GOLIKOV WHIMPERING) Khan. Tank kaput. Tank kaput. Nanawatai. Okay, okay. Take the boots. Okay, take the helmet. Yeah, take the helmet. Okay, okay. Take the boots. Sorry, sir. Not much of a war. No Stalingrad. How is it that we're the Nazis this time? How is it? I'm trying to be a good soldier. But you can't be a good soldier in a rotten war, sir. I want you to live, to see them win. Go. I said, go! (SPITTING) (WOMEN YELLING) Badal! Badal! Afghanistan.
