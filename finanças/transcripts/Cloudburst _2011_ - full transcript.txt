We can't even have this conversation. Ah. Dotty, please. l'm here. Please. Oh, no, l can't. l can't Stella. l got her, l got her. l can't get up. Wrap your arms around me. l cannot get up. Up. Up. Ah. We should go back this way. lt's shorter. Here we go. l'm sorry. Should have told you - highest tides in the world. No kidding. All right, Dotty, all right. [gasping] So, where should we drop you off, Prentice? Well, l've got nowhere else to be. Don't you guys need a best man? [laughs]... ...l guess so. Yeah, good, we do. ♪ Now which way? Right. How the hell would you know? Well, you asked me. Are we here? We're somewhere. Ah, fuck, it's Lunenberg. Some navigator you are. Shut up, Stella. Why didn't you ask me? l didn't want to wake you. You need your strength. Never know when you might have to lift Teletubby here, again. Leave me alone, Stella. He said it was an old form. Not a lot of people get married around here. So, do you want to be the bachelor or the spinster? The bachelor. Well, l don't want to be the spinster. Oh, come on, Stella. You can be a spinster for one day. This is stupid. Maybe we shouldn't fill this out. OK, fine. You can be the bachelor. That's $1 1 5. You take American? At par... A dollar equals a dollar. lt's gonna take five days. Five days? That's the processing time. Listen, Craig... How many people are ahead of us waiting for a marriage license... ...here in Bumfuck Nova Scotia? She got it. What? Oh, good. ♪ An inch and a half of foam, Dotty. Oh, thank you. To Prentice, our best man. Our only man. Excuse me. Guys. Um, uh... ...l know that you're not at an actual wedding reception, and you shouldn't have to hear a speech, but... Stella and Dot are getting married tomorrow. [cheers and applause] And l'm the best man. And the best man gets to make a toast... So, my greatest love affair lasted three weeks, minus a day, which is when l asked her to move in with me -... ...because she looked really good mowing the lawn in a bikini top. [crowd laughs] And she was smart enough to laugh in my face. Because young love is stupid, l guess. Yeah. l've never seen love like Stella and Dot before. Because they've been together for 30 years. 3l... ...[whistles, applause]... ...31. They don't lose count. 'Cause you see, Dot can't see. But she knows Stella so well, it's like she sees her. And only her. And Stella... ...well, she sees everything else so Dot doesn't have to. [crowd laughs] And...that's it. l mean... ...if love is your goal, be like these two old dykes... ...and practice. [cheers, applause] Have another drink, Prentice, love. Have another drink. You want some beer? Here, over here, there you go. [giggling] OK. Thanks. Want a blanket? No, l'm all right. What is it? 31 years. [sighs]... ...31 years l loved Dotty, and l never said it. l mean, l said it to her, sometimes, but, to say it on paper, before the whole world... ...l can't do it. What? Why? Taking Dotty on this trip... ...l nearly killed us both. Watching her almost drown. She's... ...she's my... ...my life. l couldn't... ...lf you hadn't been there, we'd both be dead. Molly's right... ...l can't take care of Dotty anymore. That's it. That's it. [phone ringing] No, no. You promised me, Stella. You can't break your promise now. lt's not gonna change anything, Dotty. lt's not gonna make us younger. lt's not gonna mean we can live together. You'll still have to go to that special care home. And l don't need special care, so l can't go with you. l mean, it's not gonna mean anything to Molly. And it's sure as hell not going to mean anything... ...to that damn judge. lt's not going to not change anything. lt's going to change everything. You didn't even want to get married. Yes, l did. lt was me or the nursing home, and l still had to twist your arm. Oh, Stella, that was just sour grapes. We're not girls anymore, Stella. We've got what - 140, 1 50 years between us. And in all that time, we could not get married. Married wasn't for us. Married was for other people, it was for normal people. Wasn't for me. l couldn't have it with you, so l didn't want it. So l told myself it was a crock of shite... ...for helpless men and women who didn't know what they want. And then, wham, suddenly l'm allowed to marry you. And, wham, second time, you asked me. l think l always wanted to marry you. You never said anything. What was the point? There were already enough things that you couldn't do... ...and you couldn't have. That's what changed everything, Stella. l mean, if somebody else asked me to marry them, l would still think that marriage... ...was a crock of shite. But then you asked me. And you know that in a million years, l could never, ever say no to you. And l've got used to the idea, so, you'll have to marry me. After 31 years, oh, to get married, and then... ...move away from each other. Oh, Stella... ...lf l'm going to die in some nursing home... ...somewhere alone, l want to die there... ...as your wife. And then when those little nurses come along... ...to give me my sponge bath, they would back off... ...because they know that my wife will whip their tits off... ...if they lay one slimy hand on me. Then you're gonna stink, Dotty. Yes, l am. Oh, Stella... Oh, my darling Stella. Marriage is perhaps the greatest and the most... ...challenging adventure of human relationships. But no ceremony can create your marriage; only you can do that - through love and patience, through talking and listening and helping and supporting... ...and believing in each other. Now today, we witness and affirm your choice to stand together... ...as life mates and partners, and the full understanding-- Nonna... Oh, thank God. Nonna-- Molly, how did you find me? Uh... l called her. You called her? Well, now we have a flower girl. Do you think this is funny, Stella, huh? Look, this whole freak show is over. Nonna is coming back with me to Bangor. Oh, no, l'm not. l'm not going back to that old people's home. l mean, l know you mean well-- Nonna, this is the right time to make the move, OK? l already put the house--... Molly, where are you? - l'm here. Keep your hands off my house, OK? ls there a judge in the room still, please? l'm a justice, ma'am. Right. You tell him how you lied to me, and how l did not sign power of attorney over to you. ls this true? She told me that l was signing an indemnity. And she just took advantage of me -... ...an old woman, a blind old woman -... ...just to get my house, my money, and everything else. Did you trick your blind grandmother... ...into signing over her bank account? l was trying to help her. Yes, or no. - Yes. But l... ...it was not like that. You just committed fraud and lied to the courts. Oh. Family court. Well, she's your grandma, and l'm a cop. This is really hot. Are you kidding me?. l am not kidding you. Apologize to your grandma. This is not even your jurisdiction. lt is mine. Sheriff, get this woman out of here, please. l am so sorry. [applause] Aren't we getting married? Later, Stella. Molly, l promised your mother that l would never, ever... ...tell you about Stella and me. My mother died when l was eight. l know. l wanted you to come and live with us, but she was against it. She just wouldn't have that. She never forgave me for leaving your grandfather. Neither have l. Well... Would you, please? l always thought that... Well, you never asked me to visit. We did. Stella and l, we asked your father. So it's my dead parents l should be pissed off at? Oh, no, that's not what l'm saying. Oh, everything was just so different then, Molly. l mean, l hardly knew your mother. And when your grandfather died, his whole family blamed me... ...and said that l was a bad mother, and they just took her away. And l was afraid that you were just raised to think the same. Well, l think l deserved a chance, Nonna. l should have talked to you about Stella and me. But l thought it was kind of obvious. Well, l know what lesbians look like. l mean, l'm not stupid. But you guys aren't exactly, Ellen and Portia. [laughing]... You want your ass kicked? - l'm sorry. Stella doesn't hurt you, does she? She's not mean to you? Oh, please. Stella looks after me 24/7. She's like a trained seal. [laughing]... ...lf you would agree to be my maid of honor, l could get these handcuffs taken off. Or you could leave them on, if it's a sexual deviant theme wedding. [laughs] Now hold these flowers. And when we get there, stand there, shut up, and mind your manners. Tommy. You're gonna be a flower girl at your Nonna's wedding. Nonna, this is crazy. Who is going to take care of you? Well, we struck a deal. He's coming back with us. He's gonna live with us, do the driving... ...and all the heavy lifting. What are you two old dykes gonna do with a hot house boy? Love him. Spoil him. Well, no need to worry about these two. And Molly... Come and visit, please, and often. Nothing but blue... Blue skies, blue water. Open. Nothing in the way. [laughs]... ...l can see that, blue, in my mind. And the wind, it's so beautiful. lt's a wedding present. Thanks. You gotta enjoy your honeymoon. Look, Dotty, he's trying to get us laid. Dotty? Stella, she ain't right. Dotty, come on, Dotty? Dotty? Dotty, Dotty... What now?. Dotty. Oh, dear God, Nonna. We gotta get her to a hospital. OK, let's get her into our car. Here, grab on to me. No, no, no. Prentice? Yeah. Where are you? l want you to marry us now. What? Nonna, not now. Now. Um... OK, um, um... Friends, we are gathered here today to, uh... ...celebrate the union of Stella and Dot, who... ...have come a long way to be here. And... Do you, Dot, take Stella as your lawfully wedded wife, to love, honor, and cherish for as long as... ...you both shall live? l do. And do you, Stella, take Dot, as your lawfully wedded wife, to love, honor, and obey for as long as you both shall live? Yeah, l'll obey her. You can cherish her if you want, that's... Come on, please. Whatever. l do. OK, um... As captain of this vessel and officiant of the wedding, l now pronounce you, women...and wives. Stella. We should probably let these guys in here. Dot had been blind since before l was born. But she saw more in me than anybody else ever did. This was a favorite piece of hers. Uh, could you just, like, back up a bit? Little bit. Yeah, that, that's fine. ♪... ...♪ We were very happy ♪... ...♪ At least l thought we were ♪... ...♪ Can somebody tell me ♪... ...♪ What's got into her... ♪ Oh, please tell me... ...he is not dancing on my grandmother's grave.
