Breaking news just coming in. A maximum security prison's trying to maintain a riot involving 600 inmates today. A prisoner, James Rowan, is currently at large. Do not approach this man, believed to be armed and extremely dangerous. My name is Major General Charles Smith, And this recording serves to document, The evolution of the viral outbreak. War used to be about borders, it used to be about religion. Now it's about survival, the extinction of the human race. My old Staff Sergeant used to say that every generation is defined by the wars it fights. For him it was World War ll, for my generation, the Gulf War, then the War on Terror, or so we thought. History changed that day. Now we face a new enemy, one without compassion, a soul, or even a heartbeat. General Smith, attention! Three weeks ago a riot broke out at Wentworth Prison in London. James Rowan, the first identified carrier of the virus. He had help with his escape. The first was this man, known as Ivan Gavric, Rowan's cellmate and best friend inside. Ivan's whereabouts are unknown since the breakout. But we believe he is within the quarantine zone - along with many of his men. -- Now go, go ahead. His hostage, Jennifer Stanton, was the second confirmed carrier. Get out. - Armed police, drop your weapon! The virus was transmitted when she bit Rowan. As you all know, she was your captain's wife, and we're sorry for your loss. The virus is currently contained in this designated quarantine zone. The fortified borders are the only things keeping the infected from getting to us. In 72 hours, the quarantine zone will be completely annihilated. Once infected, the virus attacks the brain and central nervous system. Initial symptoms include fever, vomiting, coughing, psychotic behavior, and extreme violent aggression. The incubation period can vary from 30 minutes to six hours, depending on the strength of the host's immune system. The virus is a bloodborne pathogen, not airborne. - This is Dr. Julian Raynes, a scientist and an expert in genetic manipulation. We believe there is a direct link between his experiments and the outbreak. If he is responsible, he may be the only hope of finding a cure. Our intel has placed him at these four locations within the quarantine zone. You have 72 hours. May God be with you. - How far are we? - Less than a mile out sir, 10 minutes max. - Listen up everyone. We hit the ground in 10. This is about extraction and nothing else. We keep our cool, we keep it sharp and we must remain focused at all times. Rodrigo, are you listening? - Roger that sun ray. No fun of any kind. Let's head to the first location point. Bernstein, over to you. Let's go. Jacob, Lau, we go left. Kira, Perez, eyes on high points. Everyone stay on station, let's move. - Poor bastard. Bernstein, what's status? Raynes' last known location should be up on our left. - Pull back, pull back, now, now, now. It's as if the infected still have memories or fragments of the lives they used to lead. You'll be entering an extremely hostile environment. All necessary force is authorized. - Captain, orders. Orders. - It's an ambush! Contact Red! Fire at will. Rodrigo, 9:00! Bernstein, they're on you! Reeves! Eyes and that away, they're coming in hard! We're being overrun, there's too many of them. - Fall back! - Fall back! - Get the fuck back! Let's head for that building! Let's move people, let's go! Let's go, go, go, go, go! Let's go! Where the fuck are they all coming from? Get the fuck back! Everyone, head for it go. Go, go, 90, 90-. Lau, get in, get the fuck in. - Laboratory tests, day 31. Upon observing behavior in our test subjects, there are signs which indicate developing sense of awareness. Certain specimens, we have found, have a higher level of adrenaline and testosterone in their systems. We believe it's why they have become harder to take down. Every day we learn something new about the virus. It's been 31 days since the outbreak first started and we are no closer to finding a cure. Hi, Ben. We're gonna need a vehicle to get to the next location. My name is Miranda, a survivor trapped within the quarantine zone. Along with others we took refuge in God's sanctuary, living off the decaying lands, trying to survive waiting and hoping that help may one day arrive. Today we were ambushed by a human gang for trespassing on their land. I lost good people over food. If anyone is hearing this, please help us. Miranda out. We got more of those things down there than we got bullets. Choose your targets wisely. No sign of human life, sir. Eagle One, this is Black Fox, we got a negative on location one. Moving on to the second location. Out. - Hey, look up here, dead. Motherfucker pulled a gun on me. - Knock it off, Rodrigo. Save your ammo. Help! Help! - Help please! - Help! _ Help us! Help! Help! Why didn't they stop? Next IV point up ahead, sir. Let's move out. Private Bernstein, where to? - Apartment 510 according to the major's intel. Top floor. Let's go. J“ Leaving in my private business J“ ♪ I just know it's what we're missing ♪ J“ We're all zombies when it comes to love J“ J“ You don't want my impression I' J“ I'll waste it all I' - Clear! - It's gonna put me off porn for life. - Yeah! Die! - I deliver you from evil. - Where are we now? - Upstairs, to the left. - Frank, get going up with me. The rest of you, hold 'em off. - Captain, it's this way. - Hey, could we play. Oh shit! ~ Ah! Ah! - Leave me, that I demand! - He's already dead! - Get him to Raynes. If he's got a cure, we can save him. - His apartment's around the corner. - Clear! - He's not here, Captain. Looks like he was taken or left in a hurry. - Son of a bitch! - Search this place for an antidote and tear this place bit by bit if you have to. - Yes, sir. - Hang in there, Corporal. - Don't let me turn into one of those things, Padre. - It's gonna ease the pain, okay? - You're wasting your time. There's nothing here and he's not gonna look left. - Okay, right. - Anything? Fuck! - Hey! - Right now, the best thing we can do is put a bullet in his head, put him out of his misery! - You put a bullet in him, I put a bullet in you. - He's fucked! - You ain't puttin' a fucking bullet in him! - Everybody stand down! I said stand down! - I'm sorry, boss. You need to stick together. Why didn't they stop. Maybe they didn't see us. Don't look at them. The inability to evacuate thousands of survivors has left them trapped. The streets of the quarantine zone continue to become more and more dangerous. Criminals and gangs have claimed their territories within the quarantine zone. Trespassing on their territory can result in the death penalty While the threat from the infected continues to grow. - Who is responsible for this? Soldiers. They came upon us in vehicles. We didn't engage. They just opened fire. - I want these bastards found, now! - We're gonna spend the night here and move out first light. Raynes is still out there. - They appear to be evolving, more aware of their surroundings. I believe that the infection causes them to attack. No longer is it simple aggression, but out of fear and paranoia. Kill or be killed. A few hours ago I evaded capture by a troop of infected soldiers. They seem to be rounding up anyone who isn't infected, men, women, and children. Where they're taking them I'm not sure. - When was that recorded, mate? - 36 hours ago. - There's a chance he's still alive. - I'm not gonna hurt you. - Stay away from us. - He was a good soldier and a good man. Jacob knew the risks. We all do. And I believe he would want us to see this through. - See ya, big man. And the days grow long. Morale and spirit in the safe zone is low. Our defenses are being pushed to the limit. Right now we have no cure, but all we can hope is that Raynes is out there somewhere. - What is that smell? What is that fucking smell? Jesus! - It's a military convoy. But they look protected. And they are armed. - We're running low on ammo and let's avoid battle this time around. Let's take cover. Everyone, stay down. Do not engage the enemy. - What the fuck just happened there? - There were survivors on the truck. Where the hell are they taking them? - We can follow his tracker. We have noted through observations and studies on our own test subjects that as time progresses, the infected appear to be growing in intelligence Learning to work together and organize themselves. It is quite remarkable. It points to higher brain functionality on a level we could never have predicted. 'Sir? - Go ahead. - I have a positive ID on our target. He's here in the bunker. - Are you sure it's him? - Yes, sir. - Stay as you are. Don't make any contact. We're heading to your position. - Understood, Captain. - Well, I'll be goddamned. Fucker's still alive. We should wait until it gets dark. We can catch them off guard. - If we stay, they'll be dead. - I'm with you, Captain. - And how do you propose we get in there undetected? - We'll improvise. I only hope this works. Really not in the mood to be eaten. Dessert, we're all fucked. - I fuckin' stink. - Perez, Reeves, take a position outside. Keep an eye out. Kira, your eyes, keep 'em sharp. - He's there, Captain. - Dr. Julian Raynes? I'm Captain Marcus Stanton. We've been sent here to evacuate you. - Who sent you? - We don't have time for questions. We need to leave. - Stay away- Hey, hey, hey. - What the hell's takin' 'em so long? - We've got a problem here. We are not here to hurt you. You're lying to me. - Listen to me, Doc. You can either come with us. - No. - Or stay here with those things out there. - Oh, you dumb fuck. Eagle One, this is Black Fox, we have package. Moving over to RV point. Will rec here and hold up till pickup. Over and out. Let's go. - What about us? - We cannot leave them, Captain. We can't. Come on, let's go. Let's go. Let's get outta here. - This ain't no fucking field trip. Our mission is Raynes. - We are not leaving them. - All right, guys, are pleasantries out of the way? Good. Let's get the fuck outta here now. - For fuck sake! Shit man, an asshole. Let's go. - Captain, I suggest you get the hell out of there now. Roger that, Kira. Come on, everyone, let's move. Everyone take cover! Enemy fire, it's an ambush. Fire at will. We need to push them back! Draw a path for the survivors. Now! - Shoot! I'm with Raynes. On your six, attack now. Go Perez. Bring him back! - Dr. Raynes, we are getting you out. Come with us! Come on. Look out! Lau! - Get Raynes out of here. - Come on, here. - I'll hold them off. Go! - Operates, proceed to northwest. Don't come out. Reeves come in with the others. I'll follow him. - Have to go. - Fuck you, we ain't leaving them out there! - You three, get Raynes out of here. I'll go back for them. Move. Go or we're all fucked. - Come on, you piece of shit. Let's go, let's fucking go. Move, move! You son of a bitch. - Get away. Get away from her. Where are they? - They didn't make it out. Come on. Hey! Well, we gotta go back. - Listen to me. Do you wanna die? Well, snap out of it. They're gone and there's nothing we can do. - Perez is right. We need to go. - Move. Let's go. Rachel! Wake up! - Come on. - Rachel. I'll distract them. You and Kira make a run for it. - We're not leaving you behind. - I'll be, but there's nothing you can do. Tell my wife I am sorry, sorry I could not be there for her. It was an honor to serve with you, Captain. The honor was all mine. - We have to go back! We have to get my sister. We can't leave her. - I'm sorry, she's gone. - You didn't even try to save her. - She's not dead. It won't be long before she becomes one of those things. Lt'll be okay. We'll keep you safe. - It'll all be over soon. Just a little longer. Hold on. You can't take me back, please. You shut up. - You don't understand. If you take me back I'm a dead man. - You're a dead man now if you don't shut your mouth and keep walking. Move! - Please help us. - Our car broke down. We heard of a camp of survivors on the outskirts of the city. We were going there until we broke down. Please, can you help us? - We should at least help them get on their way. - We don't have time. Let's go. - Please help us. - Oh, what the fuck! - Jesus! - What the hell was that? Hey, I'm talking to you, bastard. They were civilians. - Fightin' a war in case you haven't noticed. And in war there are fucking casualties. - Human life is sacred. You take that away from someone, might as well wanna be one of those things out there. Your family would've been ashamed of you. {Men grunting] Hey. - We should stop this. - Nah, fuck 'em. - Get up. Yaw! - Get Ivan on the radio. Tell 'em we've got him. - God hasn't abandoned you. And neither will we no matter what you think. Here, here, here. Fuck! 'No! _ Go! GO, go! Go! Where the hell are we? Ah, it's an abandoned wing dating back to World War ll. - You were testing on prisoners? - Reeves, Lau, your Captain, Kira, all blood on this motherfucker's hands. This is our chance at payback. You got nowhere to run, nowhere to hide. And once we take you back, you're gonna pay for everything you've caused. - Stay back. L'll shoot - Do it. I said, fucking do it! This man doesn't deserve our sympathy. If you won't do it for yourself, then do it for Kira. - Rodrigo, what the hell do you think you're doing? This is wrong. Stop it, you're killing him. We need him alive. - I'm sorry, kid, I'm sorry. You all right? - That's enough, Frank. I said that's enough! What the hell's going on here? - Captain, you're alive. - We thought you were dead. - We would've been if it wasn't for Lau. He didn't make it. - How'd you find us? - Put it on Raynes back at the camp. Figured he might make a run for it. Where is Sergeant Reeves? - We were ambushed. - You ran, Frank, I saw you. You ran. - You would've done the same in my position. You were as good as dead. You just can't help yourself, can you? You know why Smith assigned me on this mission? Because he didn't think you were up to it. And he was right. You're weak and you're the one that's getting your team killed! - Come on! Get up, get up! - Cap, Cap, Cap, Cap- That's enough. Rodrigo. - Sir. - Kira. Yes, sir. - Take his guns and lock him up. All right, you piece of shit. - He's not your friend. Don't forget it. He's the reason why your wife is dead. Shut up, you fuckin'. - Fuck off. - Captain, I don't know if it means anything, but we heard talk of a camp for survivors. On the outskirts of the city? - We focus on the mission at hand. That is our priority. - Sir. Get out, you fucking. Sleep it off. Kira, look he told me you were all gone. If I knew, I woulda never left you out there. You gotta believe me. - I just need to be on my own. - Few years ago, I was heading a successful research team involved in some highly controversial genetic manipulations, stem cell research. When our funding ran out, we were approached by the military who presented a very generous offer. - The military? - They wanted an advantage on the battlefield, something that would give 'em an edge over the enemy. They wanted us to create a new drug, which would enhance the soldiers' physical ability in terms of punishing. The powers that be were impatient and they demanded results. - Hey, hey, hey, hey- Don't shoot. It's only me. Look uh-- - Don't come any closer. - Look, Kira, you're scaring me now. Put the gun down. - I've been infected at the camp. - Oh fuck. - Let's make it quick. - Ah Jesus, fuck. Jesus, fuck! Fuck! Come here, come here. - Why did you do that? You're infected now. - I'm not gonna leave you. Right? - Tell me about patient zero. - James Rowan. He was one of our first test subjects. Unlike the others, it didn't fully mutate. He had the strength, the agility. Never fully took over. And we never knew why. He had some sort of natural immunity. There was a riot in the prison. It seemed perfect distraction for getting Rowan out. He was supposed to expose what was going on to the world. Instead he unknowingly released the virus. - Millions and millions of people are dead because of what you created. Do you understand the magnitude of what you've done? I lost my wife because of you. And an unborn child I will never... Let's just hope you can get us out of all of this chaos. - I'm not gonna hurt you. - Sh, sh, sh, it's okay. I'm here. Not going anywhere, okay? Listen, Frank, I really don't care what you think about me but we're in this together whether you like it or not. Come on, Alicia, let's go. - Let's go, let's go. You all right? It's all right, it's all right, gotta move. Let's go! Let's go, let's go. Kira! Rodrigo! - All right, here's what's gonna happen. Me, Kira, and the doc here, we're just gonna walk away. Don't try to stop us. - Drop your weapon. It doesn't have to end like this. - You ain't as fast as you think you are, Cap. - Doctor, is there anything you can do? Please. - Oh, I'm sorry. You're too far gone. - No, fuck that! He's lying! The doc's lying! Take cover! Perez! _ Sir! - I need you to cover Bernstein and Dr. Raynes at my command. Okay got it! - Now! Come on, come on. - Get in the car or you won't last. Go! Come on! Forget 'em! - Thank you for saving me. - Eagle One, this is Black Fox. Just checking on our ride out of this shit hole. Are we still good for 1600 hours pickup? Be advised, we have five assets for extraction. Do you copy? - Black Fox, this is Eagle One, that's a go on transport. See you soon. Out. There they are. Let's get it done. - I want to give you something. What's this? - Answers. Keep it safe. You'll find it useful if anything should happen to me. No matter what happens, you find a way of getting that girl out of here. Things are not always what they seem. Remember that. - Job well done, Captain. This is the end of the road. - Sorry Captain. I'm just doing my job. It's nothing personal. - Julian. It's been a long time. This ends today. - No, no, no, no, no! - What the hell did you just do? - My little boy is gone because of this man. Raynes needs to be found and brought back alive. He may be the only hope of finding a cure. - What about the cure? - There never was. - I lost half my team for this? - No, Captain, your men died for my son. This is the only cure that exists. - You're the one responsible for all of this. - We had to be sure before we began the eradication of the quarantine zone. Raynes and his research were the final loose end. Bernstein, do you have what I need? I'm sorry, Captain. - You piece of shit. I trusted you. - I had no choice. He has my parents. - That concludes our business. Let's go. - Hey! Take the girl. - Sir. - I'm sorry Lieutenant, your services are no longer required. Die! - You have to leave me or we're all dead. You promise me one thing? You'll expose them. Expose 'em all! NOW, go! It's been fun, Captain. Let's go! - Let's play- Come on! You fucking bitch! - Where are we going, Captain? Captain. I'm sorry, Captain. Now, I know I deserved that. Please, please believe me. I didn't know what he would do, Captain. Please believe me. - Look at where the fuck we are, Bernstein! My team are dead! For what? To collect intel? - I'm sorry. Sorry ain't gonna bring 'em back. - Please, Captain, please. Don't leave me. I'm begging you. Please! Ca-captain! Please! - You're not going to leave me, Captain, are you? - No. I promise. What's wrong? Nothing. - Jesus. Not you. - I'm sorry, I thought you would be mad if I told you. - Let's go find somewhere safe, okay? Somewhere we can hide. He's the reason why your wife died. The quarantine zone will be completely annihilated. - Alicia. Alicia, what are you doing? You stop it! Stop! - Who's there? - He's clean. Come with us. You left me. You promised you'd never leave me. You lied to me, Captain. - I'm sorry, Alicia. - You left me, just like my dad. - I know I made a mistake. I'm not going anywhere. - But I'm infected. - Don't worry about that. It's me and you against the world now. You're my mission and we're gonna get through this together. I promise you. Ls this everything? Yes, sir. And Raynes? - Well, he no longer poses a threat. Good. - We've seen how the infected can work together. Imagine what we can do with them once we can control them. Well, now that we have Raynes's research, we should finish what we started. - Our only priority now is to destroy all traces of the infection. - With respect, sir, I strongly disagree. - We are fighting for our survival. - I respect the tragic loss of life. But we can honor them by finishing this, by creating the weapon we intended to defend ourselves against our enemies. - That is all. You're dismissed. - Tell me, soldier, what are you and your men doing here? - No. - I despise your type- Got army blood running through your veins. Your weak misguided sense of honor, loyalty. You're no better than those things out there. How does it feel to be abandoned, to be left all alone out here, no one to save you? Discarded just like those they tested on. The little one is infected. But you know this, right? - She's just a kid. - Well, it makes no difference to me. - Please, she's all I have left. She's all I got. - But she will die, you know that. But still you try to protect her. Why? - A man like you could never understand why. - And you think I am heartless man, Captain, that we haven't all lost friends, family, not true! I like to think I am reasonable man. Shoot the girl or shoot yourself. Wait! Laughs] You are so predictable. Bring the girl here! Let's make things a little more interesting. Come on. I want you to take his life. - You are one sick son of a bitch. - I'm sorry, Captain. - It's okay, Alicia, he's right. Save yourself. Captain's orders. No, no, no, no! No, no, no, no, no. - I'm infected, Captain. He said I'm going to die and he said only one of us could leave. If you die, Captain, no one will look after me. And I don't want to be on my own. You're the only friend I have left. - It's okay, little one. It's okay. Where did you get this from? Where did you find it? - My mom gave it to me. - What is your name, little one? - Alicia, Alicia Rowan. - Son of a bitch! You're Jimmy's kid! Why the hell didn't you say so? It's Jimmy's kid! It's Jimmy's baby! Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy. Our only priority now is to destroy all traces of the infection. - I am sorry for your loss, little one, but it is a cruel world we live in. I wish I could make you better. You are both welcome to stay. We have food, shelter. - I'm afraid it's not over for us yet. How do we get out of here, out of the quarantine zone? - The nearest border is around 20 miles east. Getting there is one thing. Crossing it another. It is heavily guarded with orders to shoot on sight. And you're looking at hundreds of infected before you even get close. You'll never make it on your own. It would be suicide. - One of my men said he heard of survivors at the outskirts of the city. Is that true? - There is a group of armed survivors based en route. We had a couple of run-ins with them. Maybe they can help you. I don't like your odds. Then that's where we go. - What you going to do, march to the border with the survivors? You are one crazy bastard, Captain! I love you! This should help. - Thank you. Why don't you come with us? This place won't be left standing for much longer. - Even if we made it out to the other side, chances are we'd be locked up. There is no life for us on the outside. Good luck. - This is Captain Marcus Stanton. Can anyone hear me? Is anyone there? We're trapped inside the quarantine zone and we're about 10 miles out of the eastern border. How's your arm? - It's okay. It doesn't hurt now. - Let me take a look. Alicia, have you been bit by those things before? - Am I in trouble? - No, no, no you're not. Patient zero's daughter like her father. The virus does not seem to have mutated in the girl. - Keep it safe. Things are not always what they seem. - Shows no signs of any side effects of the virus. - Highly controversial genetic manipulations. - This must be due to her unique genetic makeup. She must be protected at all costs. - We were approached by the military. - The military? - This mission is strictly off the books. - She could be used to weaponize the virus. Not you. Dr. Raynes was watching over you this whole time. That's why he stayed behind. I'm sorry, Ben. So, he wasn't a very good climber. - Sir, we've just intercepted a radio message from Captain Stanton from inside the quarantine zone. He's alive. He's making his way to the eastern border. We're close. Captain, Captain. I know you're there. - Smith-- You've done well to survive, Marcus. I trained you better than I thought. - The girl you abandoned, the one I asked you to take, she's immune. - Well, even if it were true, it's too late. - You listen to me, Smith, I'm gonna bring her back and I'm coming to get you. You got a lot of blood on your hands. You got a lot to answer for. Come on, let's go. - Fortify that checkpoint. Send more men if necessary. Under no circumstances is Captain Stanton or anyone else to get across that border. They're all infected. - That's where we're gonna go, okay? But we need to get there as quickly as possible. - I'll race you. Come on, Captain, you're too slow. Captain! - Oh shit! They walked straight into the minefield. - Stay exactly where you are. I'm coming to get you, okay? No, Alicia, don't move. Can you sing me a song? - What song? - Do you know He's Got the Whole World in His Hands? That song, okay? Close your eyes and sing with me, okay? J“ He's got the whole world J“ J“ In His hands J“ J“ He's got the whole world J“ Let's go. Cover your ears! Go! - Behind you! - Alicia, run! - Captain, this way! - We finish what we started. How did you get to be here with all these people? - I was a volunteer nurse helping out when the virus first broke. We had no idea how fast it would spread. Eventually we made it out here. We had hoped to head for the border, but there was just too many of those things out there. - You're gonna have to leave this place, all of you. - You're asking me to walk 200 people out to certain death. Why would I want to do that? - The military are commencing a strike order in the quarantine zone. You are just collateral damage. Everything this side of the border will be dead in less than three hours. - I don't believe you. They wouldn't. There are too many survivors. It would be murder. - Then tell me this, how many search and rescue helicopters have you seen fly overhead? They know you're here but they're not coming to get you. I'm sorry, I wish I was wrong. They are getting ready to strike. They have left us here to die. They've never had any intentions of rescuing you. - You're talking about genocide. - The only thing they care about is containing this virus. As far as they're concerned, we already dead. What we need to do now is leave and head to the border as quickly as possible. It's our only chance. - Why should I trust you? - If Alicia holds the key to that antidote, I will do everything in my power to get her across that border. We came here to find a cure. And I am gonna complete my mission. And I will do this with or without you. I could do with you by my side, but if you chose to stay, you will die. Come on! Let's go, to get her out of here. - Get Alicia to safety. - Come on! - I got bitten and I got better. You'll be okay, you have to be. You said you'd protect me. - Uh, I need you, I need you to take this, keep it safe. Alicia, life doesn't always work out the way we planned. - You said it was me and you against the world. - I'm sorry. I can't do this, Alicia. No, sir. Wake up, Captain, wake up. Captain. Wait. Don't. Don't. You said you'd protect me. You're my friend. It's me and you against the world. _ Help us! You have to help us! - This is Private Perry Bernstein. Think about what you are about to do. Please. There's a little girl here who might hold a cure. - He's lying. They'll say anything. If they cross, they infection will spread. We can't let that happen! Keep your weapons raised. - Open fire now and you will have to live with that decision for the rest of your lives. There are families here. Children. I'm begging you. - He's lying. You have your orders soldiers. Raynes needs to be found and brought back in line. He may be the only hope of finding a cure. Trained you better than I thought. Open fire! What about the cure? There never was. I just hope it was worth it, Captain. We came here to find a cure and I am gonna complete mission. There is no cure. This is the only cure that exists. - I'm coming to get you. You got a lot of blood on your hands. - Under no circumstances is Captain Stanton or anyone else to get across that border. - Everyone stand down. Everyone hold your fire. Stop it. Wait. L'll do it. It's my captain. Almost home, Captain. He has my parents. Captain, this way! Mission successful, Captain. Wake up.
