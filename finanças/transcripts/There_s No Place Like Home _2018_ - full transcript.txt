EVERYONE IS FINE They say the family is our starting point, then we flee, and then we come back to it. Your sister actually managed to organize this! She's stubborn. What's going on here? Move it! Claudia wants to come over tonight at 8:00. We won't be home till 9:00. Can she sleep over? Fine, I have no say anyway. Hey! So this is a serious reunion! Sure, we're going all out. - How are you, Paolo? - Great. I'll ask you again after. - And you, Diego? - Always overloaded but fine. - Sara? - She arrived last week. - Hi, uncle. - Hello, Luna! You've become a woman in the blink of an eye. Hi! He's Edoardo. My uncles, Paolo and Diego. Diego is married to Sara, who is his sister. I'm confused now, but hello. Hi. You know your parents pestered me into coming. I told them I didn't belong but they insisted I come. Guess I impressed them. - Let's go. - I'm glad! Sleeping there tonight? No, I have to hop on a flight tonight. - Where to? - Paris. Nice! - Hi. - Hello Sandro, how are you? I'm Elettra. Elettra. - Hello, I'm Beatrice. - I'm Elettra. - Elettra is Carlo's wife. - Hi Sandro, I'm Paolo. Coming with us? No, we're waiting for Riccardo and Sandro's mother. Bye. - Who's that? - His cousin. He still thinks you're with dad. - He must be confused. - No, he has Alzheimer's. Really? I'm sorry. Poor thing. - Rule one... - Never speak my mind. - Bingo. - So I'll shut up. Just leave it all to me. Mom, can you keep up? I don't want to fall or I'll bust a hip and bye-bye! There's your brother. - Hello. - Hey, Sandro. Hi, Beatrice. - Remember me? - Isabella! - You remember! - Hi! It's been forever since I've seen you. Know who he is? The writer, Paolo. He writes poems? - Who is this princess? - Cristina. An honor to meet you, Cristina! - Have you met? - I'm Elettra. Isabella, Umberto's daughter. The relatives from Latina. Paolo, Sandro didn't recognize you before. - He wants to say hi again. - Sure. - Hi, Sandro. - Paolo. How are you? Happy to see you. All of you. Sandro was looking forward to it even if being out all day will overexert him. - Paoletto. - Auntie! You're famous now... and we thought you were a good-for-nothing! How are you? How do you think? I'm still alive. We'll go sit inside, it's too windy out here. Bye. - We'll go up. - Me too. So, how's France? I no longer live there. No? - Is here okay? - Yes. - So you live in Italy? - Yes. I've just returned from a long trip but I'll be in Rome for a bit. Oh God, we're leaving. Remember when you were a kid and we'd spend every summer on the island? He'll remember the island when he sees it. Right, Sandro? It seems like yesterday when you brought me here for the first time. - How's it going, boss? - How are you? I didn't expect to be invited. The prodigal cousin returns. I heard about the shitstorm with your wife. Never mind. Clever girl opened your Dropbox folder... Old news, Riccardo. I even saw you with that chick, son of a bitch. You were at the mall a few months ago all cozy with her, so I didn't say hi... Shut the fuck up. Chill. Chill, my ass. Lower your voice. Easy, bro. I won't tell anyone. - I'm no Judas Iscariot. - No, you're a dick. I got you a job when everyone else shunned you. Remember that? Of course. - Then shut up. - Okay. Sorry for saying that... Know Luana? Luana, baby, come here. He's Diego, my cousin's husband. - Hi. - You're the famous Diego. Riccardo's told me tons about you. I wanted to thank you for everything. - My pleasure. You're pregnant? - Yeah, and I think I did it. We'll call him Caesar, a serious name with no bullshit. Then hail Caesar! Hail Caesar. - See you later. - Later. It's small but beautiful. Really beautiful. I spent every summer here. It's great in winter too. Awesome. You should've come sooner, I told you. They're coming! Sara, are you ready? They're coming. Yes, mom. - Is daddy coming, too? - Yes, honey. Carlo! I'm going to get them. Ginevra, coming? Yes. Make your sister go get your ex! Ginevra, don't start. She needs help accompanying them to church. She's coming. Deal with it. Your parents still don't realize that I'm your wife. You promised you wouldn't talk to her, so don't dupe me. Let's go. 50th anniversaries are celebrated in church? I honestly have no idea how they are usually celebrated. But this celebration is really important to my parents. I realize you can't stand the sight of Elettra, and I understand that. I would never mingle with my husband's ex, but she's like a daughter to my parents. You know... my mother forced me to invite my cousin Riccardo. Understand? I can't stand the sight of him. But I'll smile and play nice, just for mom. Do the same, be the bigger person. Smile and let's make sure everyone has a great day. We're women, we can do it. - Riccardo! - Hey, girl! Nice to see you. Your hubby talked my ear off about you. - Really? - Yes. She's Luana. She's my super cool cousin Sara. - Hello, welcome. - Thanks. Look! Oh God, what a surprise. Having a baby? No, a cat. - We're surprised too. - I bet. - Your son? - Yes. - Honey, this is uncle Riccardo. - Hey, champ. You were this big when I saw you, I worked for your mom. There's Diego, excuse me. Come on. - Honey! - Darling. I was afraid you wouldn't come. Vittorio, did you and mom have fun? Yes, but I'm "more happy" you're here. Bravo! Our boy needs grammar lessons. - Luna! - Jedi Master! Cutie! How's my little doll? - Have a nice trip? - Yes. Edoardo. Ginevra, my father's wife. - My bro! - Hi. I'm so excited. You're so gorgeous. You are. - Hi, Sara. - Hi, Elettra. How are you? - Sandro, hello. - Hello. Aunt Maria. Welcome. Hi, Beatrice. How are you, auntie? How do you think? I'm whistling past the graveyard. - Know how old I am? - No, you're so pretty. 83... but I want to reach 90 and win the jackpot. Excuse me. Isabella, how nice to see you. I'm glad you came. Hi, sweetie. Come on. Now we'll take the main road that leads to Saint Candida church where mom and dad will meet us. There'll be a short mass then we'll go eat and party at home. Hooray! Uphill and zigzag to reach the church. To swim, go right and downhill. I've read all of your works. - Really? - Yes. "Grand Chaos", "Homewards". "20 Minutes" is incredible, I read it three times. - Three? - I swear. - That's old stuff. - Old stuff? You're nuts. - Remember it now? - What? The island. Did you remember the port? All ports look alike. Who is this boy with you? Edoardo. You met him 2 years ago at my 14th birthday. He's my best friend. Not boyfriend? - All the better. - Why? He's fine as a friend but as a boyfriend... he's too cute and probably vain. He'd cheat on you with lots of girls. - Carlo, want to hear a secret? - What? I wore this coat when I got married and was pregnant with you and it still fits. Just a bit tight on the shoulders. How are you, Pietro? Your father is so nervous. - Ask her yourself. - What? - If we're sisters. - Ask me what? She says you're sisters with different moms. - It's true. - You're step-sisters. - We like the word "sister". - Come here, honey. Carlo, how do I look? Is my tie straight? - Yes. - Does my face look old? You look great. I'm tired. - Unfortunately. - What's going on? - They're here? - Yes, everyone. Even Paolo. Come on in. I didn't expect to feel this nervous. I'll go in. They're coming. Sandrino! - Remember uncle Pietro? - Yes, I remember him. Hello, uncle. Stand here. You made it! Well, before we begin, you've all come to this island which Pietro and Alba adopted as their second home. This is a lovely declaration from friends and relatives who've come here to demonstrate their love for Pietro and Alba on this occasion... Why bother getting married at their age? ...this amazing occasion. Thanks be to God. I'm honored to be here today to celebrate... the strength and unity of a family born under Christ on this same day 50 years ago. But on that day, it was just us and four friends, two of whom were our witnesses. I had sadly lost my parents already, and Alba's parents, royalists, considered me, a Communist from the north, the devil in person! But we married anyway, rolled up our sleeves, we took over the restaurant I waited tables in, and bought it 10 years later. You know the rest since you come eat there often and never pay! And let me remind you that even Hollywood's greats come to eat at San Pietro. Well, all I wanted to say is... seeing you all here for me and Pietro is so important. We wanted to thank you all. Thank you. Now, enough with the chitchat, let's eat! Hooray, mom! Hooray for the bride and groom! Hold on, I have to tell you about this though... You all know Paolo has just returned from a long trip to Latin America. Know how he got there? By bike. Really! He woke up one day, grabbed his bike, and pedaled to Argentina. In fact, we weren't sure he'd make it to the party. He just woke up and pedaled to the "Land of Wire". No! Land of Fire. Land of Fire, right. Paolo? Tell us more, we're curious. Mom, he lied. He took the train, arrived, took a selfie, and came back. - Silly! - He did this at every stop! - Tell us more. - What can I say? What should've been 2 weeks became 6 months. Let me say this: he had a bow for hunting! Like in "The Hunger Games"? Really? You can use it? Where civilization ends, you either, hunt, fish, or starve. I use my credit card, I'm a caveman! Why'd you take off without telling anyone? He wanted to be free. Freedom! - I can't believe it... - Start the show. What show?! He left home at 18. Sara and I worked at the restaurant. Mom tells us he wants to be an artist and write poems. - You did write a book? - Three. - Three. - Three books. - I read them, did you all? - I did too, mom. Then he went to Paris, got married, had a kid, wrote a play in Paris. Hear that, auntie? In Paris, not Vetralla! Then he gets divorced, moves in with mom and dad, and rides his bike on Via Aurelia, Santa Marinella, Civitavecchia... so why not Patagonia? - He still deserves applause. - Bravo, Paolino. Carlo, remember when you wanted to be an actor? But he became the family artist! Deal with it! Listen to this one: Berlusconi's son asks his father... - No, please. - Listen up. "Dad, what's love?" "Love is when you buy a home, a nice car, and jewels for a lady." "And what are feelings?" "Feelings are a device the Communists invented to fuck for free!" Real classy. Great joke for the kids. Come on, lighten up! Cheers! Cheers! So... your family considers you a loose cannon. They haven't seen me in years, they don't know me. You got divorced? Yes. I cheated on her with an actress and got caught. She kicked me out in 24 hours. And your kid? We're going through a bit of a patch... he loves his mom's new boyfriend. And so? I go to sleep late. And you? Are you happy? Do you have a husband, a normal life? My life... is stagnant. Stagnant? It's true, I've never said it before. Shall we stroll? Your boyfriend? No, we're friends. They dated two years ago. Mom, please! Just for two weeks, it's true. At their age they can be anything they want. Enjoy life fully. You're lucky. - What's your name? - Vittorio. Hi, Vittorio. Who's your mom? Sara. Sara. And you? Cristina, Isabella's daughter. Isabella... Isabella bella bella bella, wants a handsome fella It's warm. Grandpa had it heated, take a dip. - Mom, the bathing suits? - In my bag in the hall. Let's go get changed. How sweet! I'm so glad you're all here. Let's see what Pietro's up to. Listen, what's this... about them only being friends? So they say. He doesn't sleep in her bed. As far as you know. Remember how we were at 16? They're different. - Different how? - Different, Carlo. "Different, Carlo"... explain. Try talking to your daughter every now and then. Spend time with her, talk, just the two of you. Carlo, could you come here? - What is it? - Come here. Oh great. Sorry. What? I barely know your relatives, she knows them all, and you left me alone to go talk to her while... - Hi, daddy. - Hi, hon. - Oh please... - What? - Ginevra... - You have another daughter. She's only 7 and wants to be with you. Anna. Honey, daddy wants to play with you. Play capture-the-flag. They don't know capture-the-flag. Old games are the best. Dad will teach you. We need more people, a handkerchief... Here. Sandro? Want to play? They got a real deal here 30 years ago. Yeah? They bought this place from siblings who inherited it and were fighting over it. They showed up with cash and took it all. It's easy to make money with money. And now they're laughing it up. Keep laughing... Living fucking large. You had fun here as a kid. Yes. Remember that summer I came with my dad? How can I forget it? Oh God, I'm blushing. How'd you come up with the idea for "20 Minutes"? The idea? Yes. By observing. Observing? Yes. During the first 20 minutes when you meet someone you describe yourself. You tell the truth about you, your past, since... you feel you have nothing to lose. And then? And then... Then 20 minutes become 20 hours, 20 days, 20 weeks, 20 months, 20 years. And you'll never interact like you did then. You end up... dreaming about running away to have 20 minutes with someone new. That is spot on. - Life is a real mess. - Totally. Number... one! Remember where we made love the first time? - No, where? - You don't!? Think I'd forget that? On the pier right down here. My zipper got stuck. "Fucking zipper!" It was August 10th, I saw a shooting star and wished: "Please let this be love". I think that shooting star fell right over here. And you stole it. I stole it! Thief! This is Pietro. I kept him still for 2 weeks to paint it. He was livid with me! That's where we are now? Yes. It's not done yet, I'll work on it this week. So realistic, you're talented. Really talented! Thanks, Riccardino... and Luana. Thank you, all of you, for inviting us, for real. Giuseppe works in Genoa. We barely see each other one weekend a month. When I met him he told me all I needed to know in the first 20 minutes. But I chose not to see it. For years I said to myself "Come on". You know... "Things will be fine". But people don't change and wrong things don't right themselves. Thanks again. My pleasure. It's so beautiful here. This piano must have cost them 40 million lira and they can't even play it. Listen... Out of tune. Know why? - They forgot about it? - Exactly. Sing me a tune, baby. Isn't your uncle great? He's talented, right? Excuse me. I must interrupt you or you'll miss the ferry. But you're great, Riccardino! You've bewitched us like Ulysses' sirens. Our Riccardino is great! Vittorio. - Anna. - Nice! Baby? It's time to go, but you didn't talk to your uncle. Shit! Uncle? Uncle. Excuse me. You were a bit busy before. Do you have a minute to talk about something? Let's go to the port. Call me tomorrow and we'll talk about it. Alba? Let's go. Relax. - Where does the ferry leave from? - It should already be here. Pietro, go to the ticket office. Anybody here? - Hello? - The sign says no ferries. Gosh darn it! They canceled the ferries. - No boats today. - All ferries are canceled. Huh? Choppy seas, no ferries till tomorrow. No ferries? What? You're kidding, we have to leave! - Let's rent a boat, I'll pay. - You can't with this sea. My flight to Paris is in 4 hours! The sea's choppy, ferries won't leave till tomorrow. This is a major problem. Beatrice, what can I do? I can't calm the sea. We can't leave, so be it. Let's go back home. - Fine. - We'll make up the beds. - No ferries. - Are you kidding? Come on. Let's go. No biggie, this is a cool place. Let's go. What an ordeal. - We can't leave? - There's no ferry. Let's rent a car. Have you gotten stranded here often? A few times. And now! Is there room for all of us? Sara, go see if San Michele motel is still open. If they have rooms, you and your brothers will go there. So we have more room at home. What'll I tell the French CFO? The truth. What truth? That I'm stuck on an island? So what? Honesty's always the best policy. Whatever. The kids can stay in Paolo's room, Luna and her friend can stay in my and Carlo's room. Single beds. - Can they sleep together? - Sure. - Why together? - Carlo, don't be old-fashioned. Old-fashioned?! Sandro and Beatrice can stay in the guest room. Are you sleeping here tonight too? - You too? - We're all staying here. Here. It was Palmira's room, remember? - You left it as it was? - Yes. We'll eat at the restaurant tonight. Pietro! Out of four siblings, only you and I are left. Don't fret. Come on. You can stay here, all right? You have a private bathroom. We can push the two beds together. No need, for just one night. Thanks, don't worry. Sorry again for this mess. Watch out. Right here. Put it here. - I'll get you sheets. - Thanks. Let's see... - Uncomfy? - No... - Everything okay? - Awesome, uncle. Just awesome. Sorry we don't have more beds, we didn't expect this to happen. No problem. Thanks for understanding. - Uncle? - Yes? As I mentioned before, I wanted to tell you were worried about this baby. Financially. How will we survive on 800 euros a month? She has some mani-pedi clients, but that's chump change. We're drowning in debt. We're pretty down-and-out. If you need help at the restaurant, I could... Riccardo, you know I love you, but we tried that years ago and it didn't work out. Because I was young, now I've learned so much. You chased customers away! Customers? I've changed, uncle. Right? We're really in dire straits. We're naming the kid Caesar, like your father. We are. It's not up to me, Carlo and Sara handle everything, talk to them. Your uncle's right, we'll talk to Carlo and Sara. You do that. I'll close this. Sure. - Talk to them. - But Sara hates me. Don't believe him, I didn't really chase away customers. Here you go. Kids, sleep sideways. Comfy? It was my bed. All right... You can change into these or bundle up if you're cold. Make yourselves at home. Thanks, Alba. - Yes? - Where are you? At the store. This motel is gross, I refuse to stay here. - There are no other rooms. - Really? She's sleeping at the house! - And me? - I'll call you later. Carlo? Carlo? Pain in the ass. Having one family is hard enough, never mind two! Real romantics have several families. Right! They try again when love falls apart! Right, until they come to a nasty end. - Expect me to divorce? - No way. I'm romantic, not bonkers. - Hello, Carlo. - Hello. Stuck here? We're stuck, ma'am. We're going to dinner in 10 minutes. Meet downstairs. Want to go to dinner? They're always eating. Dinner time! Coming. - Let's go. - Yes. Come on. Everyone here? Luna said she wants to be a biologist. Send her to America with a study abroad program. Then I'll never see her. You think she'll still want to see you when she's 18? You're adorable when you say stuff like that. Adorable? - Are you okay money-wise? - Yes, I am. All right. We'll talk later. Honey, wait! Why the rush? I was calling to see if the restaurant's open but I have no signal. I can't say this out loud but I'm actually glad we got stuck here and will sleep at the motel like we did back in the day. We haven't had time to be together in so long. No? You're right. You and I never have alone time. - Cheers. - Congratulations. - They don't even look at me. - They look at your backside. They're jealous, they can't believe I'm with such a babe. Actually, I can't believe it either. - Sweetie! - I love you. I dreamed of being a ballet dancer. I got accepted to the dance academy and was thrilled. My father refused because he said dancers are whores, but in reality he couldn't afford to pay my rent in Rome. I should've gone anyway on my own, but didn't have the guts. So I spent my whole life in Latina. What can I do? That's life. We're made of the same matter as the universe. We're star dust, we're like planets, like trees, sunsets, and so according to mystic law, our vibrations resonate with universe's vibrations where things transform, they don't perish. Like our life! Thanks to this practice, I saved my marriage. You should try it too, to release your Buddha-ness. Buddha-ness? Yes, your inner Buddha. Luna, get down from there, you could slip and fall. Think we'll be able to leave tomorrow? Dunno, hope so. What's up, bro? You're supposed to be in Paris tomorrow? If this fucking sea calms down. Fucking sea... Thanks again, that job you found me was a godsend. But it won't suffice once the baby is born. Diego, you're the only one who really helped me. But...? But I need to ask for one last favor that'll save me. - I've heard that before. - Last one, promise. Convince Sara to let me work at the restaurant again. So I can sort myself out. I'm drowning in debt now. I've always been loyal to you. I saw you at the mall and didn't tell anyone, not even Luana. You can convince Sara! Guys, shall we go home? It won't be easy. Just try at least. Fine. I'll do it for the baby. - Thanks, bro. - Knock it off. - What's going on? - Idiot. I love your husband. Riccardo, you brought back the good old days before. - Play for us again if you can. - Gladly. - It's cold, can we go home? - Let's go. There's my baby! Listen to this one... A guy asks a girl: "How many men have you had?" "4" she says. "Actually, 5". Him: "Not too many". Her: "True, it was a rather low-key week!" Fucking hell! I'm afraid I'll reach the end of my days and realize I didn't really fully live. We carry regret with us forever. No? Hey... can I say something? No need to ask. You know... that kiss we had when we were kids was my first. Seriously? Well then I have a confession too. It was my first as well. Hold on... Come here. What are you doing? Are you nuts? You're dangerous... that's what you are! - Know where they're going? - Where? To Never-never land! Come on! To Never-never land! To Never-never land! This is amazing! Yessir, captain! What if they find us? Grandma and grandpa are right next door if you need anything. - Goodnight, honey. - Night, mom. See you tomorrow. Where's mom? On her way, just go to sleep. She'll come give you a kiss when she gets back. - Goodnight, darlings. - Goodnight. How do you think you'll be in 10 years? Righteous. Meaning? Righteous: someone who behaves properly and doesn't mess up. I don't want to fuck up my life. I don't want to be like my dad who left when I was one. Righteous. Yeah. How did this happen? I fell from a tree when I was a kid. You climbed trees? You wanted to fly away. I like you. Likewise. Lights out? - Goodnight. - Goodnight. When did we have our 20 minutes? As kids... or on the ferry coming here? Or right now? What if our 20 minutes have yet to begin? I'm really sorry I'm not well. Don't fret. Why are we here? Because there are no ferries back home. Ferries? Let's sleep. Remember it? I heard it on the radio the other day and it brought back lots of memories. Good ones and bad ones. But all important. Riccardo asked me to talk to you. He really wants to work with you again at the restaurant. He asked you? He's in a bind. He can't be trusted. He's just asking for another chance, poor guy. We gave him one already. You even got him a city job. That's not enough for him anymore? Can we stop talking about Riccardo? Our kids seem so restless still. They'll find their peace, just like we did. Why don't you make me feel loved? You can't even answer? Ginevra, you should find a passion, a job, something. Your life cannot continue to revolve around me. Right, because I was just a rebound for you. Elettra and I split up because we weren't happy. We have a daughter, what can I do? - I want a man who loves me. - You have one. I love you. I'm just trying to keep everyone united, don't you get it? I just want us all to be happy, for fuck's sake. And stop crying. Okay. Sorry. I just want to be with you. Wait, Ginevra... Ginevra, wait! The most beautiful sea: hasn't been crossed yet. The most beautiful child: hasn't grown up yet. The most beautiful words I wanted to tell you: I haven't yet. Why don't you fuck me more often? You and I always used to fuck, remember? I want us to be happy again. Tell me you love me. You never say it. You know I love you. As of tomorrow things will change. You'll see. Who cares about your past! Promise? Promise. Oh God, what time is it? It's morning. Hi. Hi. I'd forgotten we were still here. Diego? He went to the port to see if the ferries are leaving. He's stressed out about Paris. Isabella! You went for a stroll? See how sunny it is? Morning. Get some food inside. - Mom! - Honey! - Where were you last night? - I went out. Did you like sleeping with your cousins? Let's go get dressed. Hi. Morning. - Hi, dad. - Wear a one-piece! Sugar! Hi, honey. Sleep well? Where were you last night? Both of you? Well? Do I have to answer? No. "Maybe this afternoon"? So we're stuck here? - Unfortunately, yes. - The sea is calming down. - When? - Who knows, it will eventually. Is it daddy? Answer. Yes... get dressed. Hello? Giuseppe? I can't hear you. There's no service around here. These? Earthquake! Come! There's no earthquake, Sandro! It's not an earthquake! Run! It's not true. He thinks there's an earthquake. Sandro, look at me. Everything is fine, we're all fine. Look, everything's fine. Right, Maria? Your mom's here. Tell him. We're all fine. It was a tiny tremor. Really tiny, Sandrino. I'm your brother, hug me. Recognize me? It's me. Everything's fine, damn it. I can't take it anymore, Pietro! I can't take it anymore! I can't! Sandro, everything's fine. Come sit down, everything's fine. Sit here. - Was there an earthquake? - No. He's not well. Where did she go? Beatrice! What's going on? What's going on? You've known me since I was 20, you know I've always loved Sandro. You know what I went through when my ex-husband took ill. I can't do it again. When I go home and smell that stench of death, I want to run away. You found each other again after 20 years, you were happy. But he's off his rocker. He doesn't recognize me, he screams and wants to leave. And he pees himself in public. You don't know what I'm going through. You can't imagine! Dump him into a hospital then. Could you bear that? I found a place. A nursing home in Rome that's like a 5-star hotel. They'd take better care of him than me. Think I don't love him? And who loves me? Who loves me?! I won't be a nurse for life. Who'll want me in 10 years? I want to die with someone by my side too. What do you know! Pietro? Pietro, what happened? When will that fucking ferry come? Can I ask something? Think Luna's a virgin? What? She was a virgin last year but at her age, I was very active... You made a promise last night. Kids nowadays seem so spacy... - Knock it off, please. - What? Why say this in front of Anna, why offend Luna like this? Why? I didn't offend anyone. Carlo? Wait... Carlo! Ginevra, what's going on? He's nuts! What's wrong? You okay, dad? I'm sorry I'm not the father you wanted. - You got wet. - I'm sorry for you... for me, for us, for everyone. Don't stress. - Carlo? - Here's Ginevra. - Badmouthing me? - Leave me alone. You abandoned us like outcasts. Anna's asking for you. Go to Anna, I'll be there soon. Happy now, Elettra? Is this what you wanted, to seeing us locking horns? Stop it. Let her talk, let's see how far she goes. You've been hovering above us like a vulture for 9 years. You sure are insecure, Ginevra. I pity you. Shut up! You're a frigid, failed spinster! You're mentally deranged. Mentally deranged! - Die, you bitch. - Enough! - Come on. - She's crazy. Hear that? She told me to die! You're the frigid, failed spinster! I told you we shouldn't have come. I was formally invited and they insisted I come. - Don't you start... - Fuck you. I'm running away when I turn 18. Fuck you. Fuck... They're fighting. Don't worry, they've always done that. I told you I didn't want you to speak to her. - Will you wait for me? - I was talking to my daughter. Don't ever interfere with me and my daughter! Enough about your daughter! Will you start being a father to Anna? Or continue being a little man? - A what? - Little man! You're a little man, little father, little husband. - Big lady. - Fuck you. A real man would've never humiliated me all these years. Always dragging the past around. It's not my fault your daughter's a ditz. - Ditzy! - I can't take it! Shut your fucking mouth before I kill myself! Kill yourself then, all of you! I'm sick of you, I'll kill you. - Help! - I'm sick of you. I'm sick of you! Help! Want to kill me? Want to? I was kidding... Kidding! I can't fucking believe this! What was I doing? How did we get to this point? We used to be in love. I was in love. I'm sure they'll make up and will come back soon. That's what adults do. They're crazy sometimes, especially when they're in love. At times they say strange things, rotten things, even if they don't mean it. Right, Aunt Maria? I need to tell you something, come here. You see, when you're in love, at times you lose control and do things. But don't be afraid, because it's fleeting. Honey, give me a kiss. I need it. What is it? Come here. Not now. After! Mom? No! No! I said no! - Why? - Calm down. Why? I said no! Stop it! Why are you screaming? Cristina! What's going on today? You okay? Just a tantrum. It sounded like you were scalping her. You okay? Riccardo, it's fine. - You okay? - You all right? Yes, I'm fine. What a temper! Everything's fine, thanks. What have you done? Me? She's married, Paolo, and has a young child. Please, are you really going to lecture me with all of your issues. Piss off. Issues? What issues? What are you talking about? About Diego? That's ancient history. - He stopped seeing her 2 years ago. - Hush. Diego chose his family. It's hard being married for years, but what would you know, you run as soon as you feel roots growing in anything but the sand in your head. That's how I like it. - You know nothing about my life. - And vice versa. Is that so? When did you last see your son? Nice! Low blow, real nice. Paolo... Keep running... Just keep running. Hold on, Paolo. Why don't you come work at the restaurant again? Come on... I miss you. Where are you always running to? Come on, Sara... Please. Ginevra. Please, don't... That bitch is staring at me like a crow of death. Go to her, Carlo. Daddy wants to play with you. - What's wrong? - Nothing. Poor thing, I pity him. You okay? Your son tried to kill me. Do you think I'm okay? What? Either tonight or tomorrow morning. Are you kidding? I'll celebrate our anniversary alone? I'll get there as soon as I can. The forecast's improving. If the sea calms down, I'll leave today. Enough already! When will you leave her, Diego? Arianna, I only love you. - What? - Hello? - What's that? - Hello? Hello? I only get one fucking bar on this island. What did you say? Don't worry, I'll keep you posted. - Hear me? - I came to Paris for you. Hello? Fuck! Hey, bro. So, can we leave today? - They don't know yet. - No? Fucking hell... Did you talk to Sara yet? She won't even consider it, sorry, I did what I could. They'll never hire you again because you're a real dick. But... what were her exact words? Sara... you're here. There are storms brewing all over the place. Mom? How did you put up with dad's betrayals? For all those years? How? I remember when you'd hide in the bathroom and cry. I never asked, how'd you do it? You know, I made him cry a few times too. But in the end, he always came back to me. It wasn't easy. Quit drinking now. Me and you... it's always been me and you for years. But I need to feel loved too, understand? Dad has his life in Genoa. And we see him for one day at most. Then he leaves for another month. Genoa isn't far. Listen, honey... I know these are things you don't want to hear, but I'd rather be honest with you at this point. Everything will be fine. Just fine, honey. Trust me. Trust me. Okay? Who is it? Come in. We wanted to ask if Cristina wants to come play with us. Want to go play? Want to? Honey... I'll close this. Okay. I was looking for you, honey. - Well? - No luck. - No ferries today? - They don't know. What'll you do about Paris? Did you call? - I postponed the meeting. - Really? - How? - I just postponed till tomorrow. Honey, that's great news. Happy? Gimme a smile. What the fuck? Carlo? You okay? Lighten up, will you? It's me. Ginevra! - Leave. - Eat something. I'm fine, feed Anna. Then put her PJs on and make sure she pees before bed. Do it for me, after trying to kill me. I didn't... If you shoot and the gun jams, you still tried to shoot! - Gun? - Get lost. Come down if you change your mind. Okay? - Dad? - How are you, honey? Carlo, can I have a word? - Not now. - I'll be quick. Carlo, I've been studying wine for the past few years. Ask me about any wine, I know it all. Try me! DOC, DOCG, IGT, Super Tuscans. I know everything. I asked your dad if I can work at the restaurant again. I need to clear the past... - What did dad say? - It's up to you and Sara. He told us to fire you 6 years ago. He did? We're in a bind. We wouldn't ask you if it weren't urgent. Sara, can I have a word? Now what? My son's due in 3 months, we're being evicted because we're 18 months behind in rent. I need your help. Help me, Sara! We've been helping you forever. You never paid back the money we lent you. We don't have any openings at the restaurant, we're fully staffed and we're pleased. Good for you! We all love you. Then show me. If you earn our trust. My husband and I would like to go see the sunset now. Go, wouldn't want you to miss it or you'd blame me for that too. - Let's go, honey. - Go, mommy's calling you. Luna? They're at the beach. - I have to pee. - You have to pee. What, mom? You always stand there and stare! You let your brother, dad, me, and everyone walk all over you. Riccardo, don't talk to mom like that. And if you don't like the restaurant, then just go! Wake up, Sandro! You wake up! Try to be patient with him. Life requires patience... Lots. Lots and lots. So will we... be best friends forever? I don't want to be your best friend forever. Neither do I. Kids, what are you doing? Hi! Ever think about having another kid? Why? Why not? Because we still have time. Because we have lots to celebrate. To add more worth to what we already have. So Vittorio will have company and we'll all be happier. Plus, after all we've been through, I think... it'd be important. It'd be a true promise. Dunno, I need to think it over... We don't have to do it now. Those kids are watching us. And these rocks are uncomfortable. Some other time. There's no rush, don't worry. Isn't this light amazing? Yes. Sandro? What's wrong? I lost my wedding ring. Damn! How long have you and Carlo been married? I remember your wedding as if it was yesterday. A long time. How many years? - 25. - Twenty... Almost 25 years. - 25 years! - Yes. Nearing the silver anniversary! Indeed! We'll have a nice party like this one. - Sound good, Sandrino? - Yes. All right... Bye. - Great. - Go ahead. Here it comes! Dinner is ready! Everyone here? All right! Paolo, what are you doing? Nothing. I am your mother, I see and hear everything, if you haven't noticed. Mom, I'm 42. I've failed many times. Are you sure you've seen them all? You're an artist. You express yourself in other ways. Whatever! What's wrong? I want a normal life. There's no such thing as a normal life. Look at your siblings. You think my life with your father was normal? You'll live many lives, and you'll do it through your book characters. You know you're special. Don't doubt it. Dinner's ready. Come eat. All set! Thanks, Sandro. Thanks, Elettra. What song's that? Sorry about before, as a mom I can understand. It can't be easy for you. Sara, let's talk woman to woman. Being broke is awful, it's terrifying. You live in fear. Everything will be fine. Riccardo's resourceful. Listen to how good he is. And you're having a baby. He'll bring you good luck. Ginevra? She prefers to stay in the room. Then I can relax. I love her and all but... she's so insecure and possessive. She's dumb, Carlo. Dumb people are dangerous. Look how she forces you to live. Hey dad! How are you? How am I? With anyone? No. No, no! I'm not made to be with anyone. Being in a couple is unnatural for me. I tried. I tried... more times than you'd think. But I'm not cut out for it. I envy those who are. But those who really are, not those who fake it. Why are you looking at me like that? You're a good mom. - Have I ever told you? - No. You never have. Let's go inside too. Okay. All these people dancing are so lovely! Bravo! Bravo, Ricky! Right? You like when Riccardino plays and sings for you... like a trained monkey! - What's that, Luana? - Quiet, let me talk. I came here feeling like a pauper and I'll leave feeling like a queen. Know why? Because I'll never end up like you! Because we'll never have a brother who screws his cousin in public. Or a brother, like him, who is everyone's punching bag. And Sara... Dear Sara who plays Miss Perfect. Right, Diego? Riccardo spotted you at the mall, you haven't told your wife yet? Sara, he's two-timing you. Wake up, already! Fuck you, you bitch! What the fuck... Let go! Let go! She's pregnant! What do you know about my life? Riccardo and I will love each other for eternity, like you two! Real love means loving each other even when love fades. The next time you plan on disrespecting him, think it over. You can stick your shitty restaurant and small savings up your ass! We're not asking for handouts! Goodbye! Stick our restaurant where? Where? You'd better slip out of the window tomorrow morning. - Got that, Riccardo? - Relax, never mind them. Keep her out of my sight or I will strangle that bitch! It's okay! Lie down. - No, I'll stand. - Okay. How shameful! What a great way to end the night. Where'd Riccardo pick up that lout? Sit down before you feel ill. Diego. Don't say a word, because deep in my heart I know the truth. I won't let that deadbeat sway me! She's a nobody! She's a nobody! All right! Now let's sleep and when we wake up tomorrow... it'll be a new day. Where's Cristina? She's sleeping with her mom tonight. Everything okay, mom? Yes, honey. Yes... Okay, sister? Yes, brother. Honey... remember that place you mentioned for people like me? Take me there before everyone forgets about me. And I forget about everyone. Including you. Not me. We shouldn't have invited Riccardo, it's my fault. You're obsessed with having a tight-knit family. I grew up an orphan! I can't fucking stand families! We'll roll up our sleeves. We'll roll up our sleeves and get by, we can face anything together. All right, baby? Together, we're invincible. HOW ARE YOU? I'M HERE THINKING OF YOU I MISS YOU ME TOO... Morning. - How are you? - Fine. Hi. And you? - Hello. The ferry just pulled into the port. Great. Sandro, let's go, the ferry is here. Edoardo, Luna! Bye, Alba. - Bye, Beatrice. - Thanks for everything. Bye, Sandro. Bye, honey. Safe travels. I'll have Pietro call you. No, I'll call him. I just want to go back to my home. Chin up, my darling. Bye, Alba. Bye, Diego. We'll be in touch. Yes. Bye. Bye, mom. I'll call you when I get to Rome. - Bye, Alba. - Bye, Ginevra. Bye. - Bye. - Bye! - Thanks for coming. - Thank you! We'll talk soon. Bye, Edoardo! Remember, young lady, we women can carry the weight of the world. Let's go! Someone lost a wedding ring. Gone? Yes. As we used to say: "Goodbye to all, and good riddance!" Let's go up front. We had an important talk yesterday, remember? About your future. Our future. I love you so much. So do I. Lots! Vittorio, don't lean over. Not cold out here? What time is your flight to Paris? 5:30. Everything worked itself out. You're leaving, I'll go home with our son, then go to the restaurant, then back home waiting for you to return. Life goes on. Right, Diego? We're lucky. You always say that, we're luckier than most, right? Gimme a smile! Vittorio! Come here. - Shall we go with dad to Paris? - To Paris? - What?! - What? The three of us have never gone there together. To Paris! Cool! Gimme a smile! We're here. Put on your backpack. Careful. Here. - Sara, can you watch Cristina? - Sure. Giuseppe came to get us, he's at the port. The ship has now docked. Passengers can now disembark. Listen, things are over with him anyway. If you want to see me again, I'm here. It's okay if you don't, I'm not a kid. I want to stop running. So handsome! Are you... going to be the one running now? See, honey? We're home. We made it. We're almost there. You okay, mom? I'm okay. I'm stronger than you, Riccardo! Seatbelt on. Hold on. I have something to say to you. Go ahead. I've been seeing someone, for quite some time. I'm telling you so I'll stop hoping things will improve. What? He loves me. He's waiting for me to leave you. I thought I'd never leave you for anything in the world. Because I loved you and waited for you so long. I did all I could to be happy with you, but the truth is, you and I will never be happy. So now we'll go home as always and tomorrow morning, while Anna's at school, I'll pack her stuff and mine and leave. - Ginevra... - No! No stress, no trauma, no shouting. Okay? Bye, dad.
