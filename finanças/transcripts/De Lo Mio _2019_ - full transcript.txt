Where is he? He should be here soon. You think he forgot about us? There's no way. I called him, like, three times. Oh. It's humid as hell, man. I should have done a dubi. I mean, if you don't want to wait. What? No, we're not doing that. I'm not doing that. It's mad cheap, and it's fun. Come on. Eh! Hey, hey, hey, hey! Hold onto him. Oof. Watch. You're gonna see. Where were you? No, no, no, no, no. Welcome home. Happy! Happy! Hey, hey, hey. Okay. Do my back. Mm-hmm. Spray my face. Over here. Walk into it. Okay. Oh. I can't believe we're here. This is crazy. Yo. This hair didn't miss this humidity. Look at this shit. I don't even know why I went to the salon. -You look fine. I just wanted to look good for her, you know? I miss her. Like, I almost expected to see her on the balcony when we came out. Pour one out for the real ones. You know she would have been mad if you did that, right? Yo, she would have been so tight. Like, it's not a fucking roof! I never thought that we'd get rid of the place. You know? I don't want to. It's just sad, because once we sell this place, we have nothing to come back to. We have our brother. Pablo. All right. Rita and Carolina: Mm-hmm. How are we gonna do all that in five days? Wait, but what's the rush? What's going on in five days? Okay, and they're gonna move in as soon as we leave? They're gonna bulldoze the house? Mm-mm. Yeah, but what about the trees? Those trees have been there for like, over a hundred years. And that's our grandmother's house. That's her home. Can we fix it up? Can we find a family that's gonna want to live there, and appreciate the house? No, we don't. Okay. Okay, okay. We get it. Do you have any emotions? Here's what we're gonna do. If you see something that you like, or something that you think is important, we can take it. But the rest, we gotta throw everything out. What are we gonna do now? It'll come back. Hopefully. Ugh. These mosquitoes are killing me. -'Cause you mad sweet, son. -No, but you're right. They're itching me, too, though. You want some Vicks vaporu ? Yes, please. Oh, God. Yo, think it's a good look? Yo, what are you doing? I don't want no cucarachas in my ear, okay? Yo, you look crazy, for real. I don't care. How's it look? You look crazy. Shot not - turning off the lights. Aw, fuck! Come on! Turn it off. I said "shot not". -Goodnight. -Goodnight. What, what's up, Cara? What's going on? Kill it, kill it, kill it, kill it. All right. I do remember. Hey, hey, hey! Me, too, yo. Look, I'm pregnant with chicharron baby. I can't wait to meet my chicharron nephew. What? What? Why? I need to meet my godson. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. -Your godson? -Yeah. -I'm the godmother. -Pffft. Obviously. I'm the most responsible one here. Does he even know we exist? I guess it's right it's different for men and women, because how are you gonna go two months without seeing your kid? Well, I wouldn't know... I wouldn't know... Papi loved you. -Listen, Dante, we're sorry-- -Ah, fuck you. I know, right? You're very rough! No, I'm not. You're just tender-headed. -You just got some big-ass hands. Just like Papi. Oh, my God. Those spankings were deadly. Even with an electrical cord, I think. You know Dante used to get it bad, too. -Did he? -Mm-hmm. I wouldn't know. He told me once, he was, like, trying to sneak out the house and steal a car. And Abuelo found him. Then he beat him up with a tree branch. -A tree branch? -Uh-huh. Knowing, Abuelo, he probably beat him with the whole tree. You know? I know. But you know what? Dante... He doesn't know how to be responsible. -I just-- -Listen, he's alone here. He's doing it alone. I mean, he grew up with abuelo y abuela . Yeah, and without Papi. Yeah. It's not our fault. No, but it's not his, either. Well, what can we do? We're here now. Mm-hmm. We're doing it for Papi. It's broken. Cool. Yes! What the fuck? How do I look, dah'ling? -Marvelous, my dear. It's not the most glamorous outfit, but... I think it looks good on me. It does. Indeed. Look at these shoulder pads, though. Like... I can't tell if I'm serving Mary Tyler Moore or Whitney right now. You look just like Grandma. I'm gonna be so hot when I'm old. Like, look at this outfit. You're a clown. For sure. The only thing missing are the shoes, but, you know. She wore a size five. I'm a big bitch. Oh, man. This fur looks good on you. I know. I'm just gonna... Oh. I should have said thank you, right? -Grandma was stylish. '70s, young, hot grandma? Business casual grandma. Taking over the world. One suit at a time. We should have been here, Caro. We're here now. Yeah, but it's not the same. Look what I got. -Where'd you get that from? I got connections. What? Nah, I found it in Abuela's nightstan. -Abuelo did love his cigars. -Mm-hmm. I don't know how to turn this on, though. You, you serious? Look, you taught me. How is this supposed to help? I don't know. But it looks badass, though. All right. Enough with this depressing shit. Grab a wig. I know, he was so cute, though! Yo, Dominican boyfriends on deck! I did not want to leave, yo. Yeah, I can't believe you made out with him! Oh, no! Stop it! -Oh, my God. -Oh, man. Yo! How many times have I got to say it? You crazy. Ah, what's up, bro? No. You didn't tell me nothing. It wasn't me. It was Caro. No, it wasn't. Nobody told me to close that. Seriously, it wasn't me. Caro was the last one out. -Wait. Is someone in there? -Shh! I don't want to deal with this right now. -I don't want to. -We can't let him go alone. Oh! A gun? Were you trying to get us killed? Dante, if they were still in the house, what were you gonna do? You were gonna shoot them? You were gonna kill them? Why are you always making a joke? We could have waited outside. -We could have called the cops. I don't understand. What's so funny? I don't get it. Why do you even have a gun, anyway? Why are you such an asshole? I don't understand. Listen, guys. We have our lives. And there's nothing of value here. What they gonna take? Shit. The passports. -The passports. -Oh, my God. Fuck. We have the passports. They didn't take 'em. They didn't find them. Good. 'Cause I don't want to stay another day in this shithole. -Oh, you've been handling things? -Yeah! You call this handling shit? Ever since me and Carolina came here, this place was a piece of shit. Stop. No, no, no. Fuck you. Fuck you, Dante! You're not gonna do that to me, okay? 'Cause where were you when Papi was dying? Hmm? Where were you when Papi was asking for you? Where were you? I had to deal with that shit. You were too proud. You were too proud being pathetic. You think I wanted Papi to die? Is that what you think? Are you crazy? You think I want to be here? You think I want to deal with this shit? And have a fuck-up like you as a sibling? You heard me. -Yo, shut the fuck up! -A fuck-up like you! Shut up! Shut up! I don't want to deal with any of this shit. That's right. Go. Run. Where are you going? What is happening right now? Rita, have you lost your mind? What are you gonna do with that? Break it. Where are you going? Rita. Where are you going? Rita! Rita! Rita! Fuck, Dante! You scared the shit out of me! -What are you doing here? It's not funny. It's not funny. I don't know where Rita is. Rita! Rita! What the fuck are you doing? You want to burn the house down? Do something! I can't bring him back. I can't bring him back. I see you. - Papi! -Hey! -I picked the wrong shoes. -I know. -Ah! -Aye. Oi. No. No. Hey, Grandma. Thank you for this. What is this place? Abuelo y Abuela used to on this place back in the day. What happened? Ah... Once they got old, they couldn't take care of it anymore, so, they just abandoned it. Red rum. I can see your bun. What now? I don't know.
