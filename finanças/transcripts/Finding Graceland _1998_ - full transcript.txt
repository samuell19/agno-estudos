Damn, I wish you'd let me take you on a bit further. You've already gone too far off your route these past couple of days. But thank you. It's generous folk like yourself keeping our nation great. I don't know what I'd have done if you hadn't come along. I was all bottled up. Damn close to doin' something. I know that. And I hope those thoughts are nothin' but distant memories now. It's taken every bit of my strength... but I finally believe you're right. Don't worry, friend. We'll meet again someplace. I just know it. God bless. Did I ever tell you why I love livin' in Memphis? You can go further north, south, east or west... but you cannot get any closer to heaven. You know, that's kind of poetic. But then what man has ever had a muse like you? Say yes again. You have no idea how perfect that sounds off your lips. Yes. How do you want to spend the day, Bea? A little drive? Sounds good to me. Back away from the car. Son... I gotta tell you... this car is one of the more beautiful sights I've seen in a long time. The 1959 convertible is the finest machine... Cadillac ever built. Titanic V-8... 390 cubic inches... 345 horses. The cream of American history. You best take care of this one. She's runnin' hot... and it's a mean sun today. This car keeps no secrets from me. Maybe we could share some secrets of our own. The name's Elvis. I'm tryin' to find my way to Memphis. I got a dinner date this Sunday. And I'm being reeled back home like a floppin' catfish. Man, I can't tell you how it excites me to see folks haven't forgotten me. Why don't you hightail us up to that vehicle... so we can get an eyeful of who's behind that wheel? I don't like crowded roads. Well, everybody has their quirks. Maybe we should start small. You got a name? Byron Gruman. Byron, huh? Mind if I call you "Burn"? I've met so many people over the years, I've come to rely on nicknames. We won't be together long enough for it to matter what you call me. Perhaps, but you never know what fate holds in store for you. Look at me. When I was a poor sharecropper's son driving a truck... every time a big, shiny car like that drove by... it started me daydreaming. So I worked hard, served my country. I did all right. Then one day my life spiraled out of my hands. I lost sight of what was meaningful. My wife, my child, my music. I found myself needin' time just to catch my breath, so I split. It's a fascinating story. But besides that hair, you hardly even look like Elvis. I think I look pretty good, considering I've been on my feet for 20 years. You're a drifter. The title ain't nearly as rewarding as the work. I travel around, lend a hand to folks who need it. What about you? What line of work lies in your tomorrow? I don't think much about the future. Well, I've given worse off than you their footing. Listen. I'm gonna stop here for a while. No matter what, I usually keep a few states between me and Tennessee. Tell you what. Why don't I buy you some lunch here? Then you drop me off just over the state line in Texas. I can catch a good ride there. I guess I could eat something. Man alive! That was almost as tasty as my mama used to do. God bless her soul. You said you had a dinner date this Sunday? Recognize the day, do you? Not really. Then I guess you're not much of a fan of mine. Son, come this Sunday it'll be August 16. The anniversary of the day I died. I suppose this ridiculous tale is your version of a mid-life crisis? Well, I did turn 60 a while back. But it was more than that. All these years on the trail made me realize... that the life I left behind wasn't so bad after all. So I decided it was time to resume my career. Wrote everyone back home and told them to have a bash... waitin' at my estate come Sunday afternoon. I wouldn't expect much of a homecoming if I was you. That's $10.80 all together. Listen, Burn, I'll need a small loan here. I'm sure the good folks at Graceland will pay you back. Plus interest. - You don't have any money? - My word is gold. Good. Then you shouldn't have any problem talking your way out of washing dishes. Hold on. Somebody has to pay for this. Franny, why don't we settle this between the two of us. Honey, I can tell you waited on some high rollers now and then. - What's this? - Don't bother thanking me. But the tab was nearly $11.00. I insist you put down more for the tip. - You what? - I insist. I'll wrestle it out of you if I have to. Why, Elvis, you are the gentleman. Keep the faith, sweet lady. What's your problem, son? My problem? You're my only problem. Other than that, life's peachy-keen. First I give you a ride. Then I'm forced to spring for your damn lunch. Okay, you got a right to be angry. But walk a mile in my shoes, Burn. I'm rich, famous, vulnerable. I got to know the kind of man I'm befriendin'. Who the hell are you to judge me? You don't know me. You don't know what I've been through. Judging from that tarnished ring you wear, it's pretty clear. Your wife left you. But taking it out on that woman back there wasn't fair. My wife didn't leave me. She's dead. She died in a car accident over a year ago. You happy now? I don't celebrate death, Byron. Trust me. I've lost more than my share of loved ones. I don't want to hear any more lies about your life. Let's get something straight. I don't believe you're Elvis. Frankly, I don't care who you are... or what terrible things have happened to your life. I'm gonna make you care, Burn. I'm gonna make you believe. I'm gonna take you to Texas... because unlike you I'm a man who keeps his word. After that, we're history. If you say so. But I'm warnin' you. You'll be sorry once I'm gone. Don't bet on it. Well, Burn, I guess this is it. Again... I'm sorry if I did anything to pester you. Forget it. Good luck, wherever you're headed. I got a feeling our destinations aren't so far apart. But wherever you go, remember the King. Just one night. Seventeen. Thank you. Thank you very much. I've seen better. Thank you. Get on up, baby! It's time to party with the King. Wake up. Well, read 'em and weep, Elvis. Girls, if you're gonna trounce me... the least you could do is make it look like you're concentratin'. Listen, son... I'm gonna need some help here. In a few minutes, this situation... might be more than a man of my propriety can handle. One hand. Will you promise me you'll leave right after, rain or shine? Seeing you take a risk will be well worth a wet coat. Girls, you're in trouble now. I found me an ally. Sit here, soldier. We can swap war stories. Be sweet to me and I might even let you see my purple heart. I'm afraid there won't be time for that. Full house. Damn! Nice deal, Maggie. That's not fair, Heather. Burn hasn't picked you yet. I know, but I picked him. One more hand, Burn? It stopped raining. - That's not fair. - Oh, come on. What about our self-respect? You want your self-respect back? Okay, we'll play a new game. Called "Reality Check." That sounds dull. How 'bout it, old timer? You up for a little identity test? Happy to oblige. We'll start easy. What size shoe did Elvis wear? My shoe size? Jesus. Wrong. But I ain't answered yet. It's just been so long since I actually purchased a new pair. Yeah. Let me check. Twelve D. How'd you know that? He's right, your flesh is gonna be public property soon, Burn. Elvis' purple Cadillac. How did he describe the shade he wanted? That's easy. I said I wanted the car to look like someone squashed grapes on the hood. I read that. What year did Elvis buy Graceland? What was his Army rank, registration number? That's hardly one question, but I'll let it slide. I bought Gladys her slice of heaven... in March, '57... and she was proud I made sergeant. 53310761. He's right. It says so right here. Put your dancin' shoes on, Burn. One night with you I love a man with ssars. That still hurt from when your wife died? How'd you know that? Oh, baby, Elvis told us the whole story. How she was killed in a car accident. Everybody out. Calm down, son. I'm not your son. I'm awfully sorry about this... ladies. It's all right, Elvis. We love you like life itself. But your friend here has got the manners of a scud missile. Son... I'm not feelin' so keen. Mind if I lay down a while? I was beginning to think I'd have to walk the rest of the way to Memphis. No trouble. Tell me about the nightmare you had last night... and I might let you take the wheel. My dreams ain't but a bunch of nonsense, Burn. That's a pity, 'cause this car's running silky smooth. Don't I know it. What was it you called it? "The cream of American history"? Ho! Let me think. There's these two people... they hang about my sleep all the time. A woman and a child. When I wake, they're gone. Who are they? I never see their faces. I wish they'd introduce themselves to me or leave me alone. What's your name? Maybe if you told me your name, then you could remember theirs. That's twice in two days you've let that car fly by. It's just a coincidence. There's no such thing as coincidence. All you got to do is open your eyes and ears... and you'll see the beauty in fate. I'll bet the first look you got of Beatrice... you knew it was preordained. How'd you know her name? It must've stumbled out of you somewhere. I was gonna be a doctor. I was the most coordinated person I knew. I never tripped, never broke a bone in my body. Then one day I wind up killing the woman I lived for. Exastly how did you do that? You have ten minutes. You drive no faster than 35, and you stop when I say. This car is one of the more beautiful sights... I've seen in a long time. Man... it's been ages since I've handled a baby like this. I do believe a moment of reflection is in order. Now, by God, grab hold of somethin'! Slow down. How did you kill Beatrice, Byron? Did you blow a tire? Did you lose your brakes? I don't remember. Bull! You're just afraid to face the truth. Slow down! Why you-- I wanna rip it up I wanna shake it up Pull over! - Look at that! An escort. - Shit! Relax. I can handle this. You're certifiable. - Do you have a driver's license? - 'Course I do. Though come to think of it, I haven't renewed it since I died. License and registration, please. Officer Haynes. I'm afraid I left my I.D. in my other pants this mornin'. But you can recognize the King. So what can I do for you today? An autographed five by ten for the loved ones perhaps? Both of you, out of the car now. He's just kiddin', Officer. I don't have a sense of humor. Since your friend don't have a license, you both have a right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You're arresting both of us? Just arrest this lunatic. I was just giving him a lift. You picked the wrong cargo. Far as I'm concerned, Elvis was nothin' but an overrated saloon singer. Can I help it if your high school sweetheart had the hots for me? Get over here! What do you think, Burn? Maybe I should show the man the light by beltin' out a little "Jailhouse Rock." One note. One note, and I cannot be held responsible for my actions. Like what? Tearing at my clothes and wettin' yourself? Don't fret, Burn. I haven't met a law enforcement agent yet wasn't soft on the King. Sheriff Haynes? What now? Are you from Mississippi? Born in East Tupelo. No tall tale! I had a schoolyard friend by the name of Harold looked just like you. We used to call him "Hap." Friends used to call me that. See, Burn? Me and Haynes are kin. He didn't say he knows you. Sure he does. Hap, you recall Mrs. Grimes' fifth grade homeroom? How we had to recite those God-long poems? "Sunset and evening star... and one clear call for me. And may there be no moaning of the bar when I put out to sea." "But such a tide as moving seems asleep... too full of sound and foam. When that which drew from out the boundless deep... turns once again home. Twilight and evening bell, and after that the dark. And may there be no sadness of farewell when I embark." No! That's why I left Memphis in the first place. Elvis impersonators, reporters knockin' on my door night and day... looking for some small detail of the final years they could turn into money. A bad dose of celebrity, huh? You know what the worst was? There was nothin' I could tell 'em. The day I heard Elvis had gone, I was surprised as any. I'd no idea he wasn't well. Sure, he was under a lot of pressure, but-- Let's just say sometimes I wonder. Well, I never could play you, Hap. What can I say to make you see fit to forgive such an abrupt farewell? Remember this with me. Once when me and Elvis was just boys... ridin' around in a little red wagon in his backyard... I guess I turned a tad fast. Anyway, he fell out. He didn't get hurt, just got scared and started cryin'. And you started screaming, "Hiss! Hiss!" Because you couldn't say "Elvis" till you was almost grown. I'll be damned! I have never related that tale to a soul. I'll never forget it. My mama came flyin' out the back door... with that broom of hers like a hen to protect her chicks. I can't believe you believe this. Watch your manners, boy. I'll write you up for every moving violation I can drum up. Now, Hap, is that really necessary? I never did apologize for flippin' that wagon over. Damn. Sorry about that... Elvis. Remember the King. - How do you know that man? - He was my childhood-- No, no. Don't tell me he was your childhood friend. Okay. I heard the remnant's of a lisp when he spoke... and I guessed he was a fan. So you admit you lied to him! - Does it matter? - What? So what if I might have lied to Hap? And I'm not saying I did, but he believed me. He can rest easier now. So what harm am l? You think your games are harmless? Let me tell you what kind of damage a car can do when it's out of control. Just imagine you're driving alongside a train. You take your eyes off the road for just one second to kiss your wife. When you turn back, the train's comin' at you. That's tragic, all right, Burn. But imagine the freedom you'd feel... if you would admit what really happened that night. How would you know what happened? Great! Now look what you did! I fix what I break. Stay away from this car. Come near this car again, I'll kill you. All right. It's all right. It's all right by me. I'll walk the rest of the way. Remember the-- Ah, hell. Forget the King. The King's dead! Well... besides needin' a new radiator and some serious bodywork... man, this thing is surprisingly healthy. Come back first light in the mornin', you'll be surprised how she runs. How much is it gonna cost me? Not a penny. You're kiddin'. No, man. Elvis covered you. And we take special care of friend's of the King. You know where he went? Head down that road there with your eyes open. You can't miss him. See ya later. Ladies and gentlemen, dress up the front line. We have a new shooter coming out. Eleven! Yes, ladies and gentlemen, play the game. Baby needs a new pair of shoes! - Seven the winner! - Way to go! Hey, there. Let it ride, dealer, for my friend. Norma Jean, I wonder if you'd do me the honor... of bringin' Lady Luck to these here cubes. - Oh, I couldn't possibly gamble. - Come on, Marilyn. You know you can't refuse the King. No good subject would. - Come on, baby! - No more bets. Comin' out. A winner! Eleven! Damn, I told her to lay off the sleeping pills. Is there a doctor in the house? Don't worry, the boy's in med school. Ma'am. Ma'am! I'll be damned. What the hell are you doing? Oh, I'm so sorry. I guess the sight of all that money must've taken my breath away. Then when I woke to find such a handsome young man kissing me... I just couldn't help myself. Are you all right, honey? I think so. Can you make out my face? Elvis? - She sounds healthy to me! - Marilyn lives! Let's hear it, ladies and gentlemen! All right! Come to our show tonight... in the Bijou Theatre and see her live on stage. Thank you, Elvis. And to this brave, young man. I do love doctors, almost as much as I love playwrights and baseball players. Thanks. Bye. Come on, Elvis. Place your bets on the front line. All bets down, sir. Let it ride, dealer. Do or die. Are you crazy? There must be $5,000 there. Who invited you to the party? Baby needs a new pair of shoes! Snake eyes! Crap dice. Loser! I'm sorry, sir. That's all right. I guess Lady Luck's been frightened away to another table. Remember the King! You got enough for bus fare? What's the matter? Forget some insult you wanted to hurl at me? I wanted to thank you for sending that tow back. I'd probably still be sitting there. Look, I apologize for getting a bit dramatic back there. But you've got to admit, you are a bit jarring on one's system. Why is that, Burn? What exactly is it about me that rattles you... besides my music? Actually, I like your singing. Beatrice loved your sing-- I mean Elvis' songs. Son, just once I'd like to hear you call me by my name. Just once! Then maybe I'd believe... you could take a likin' to something other than your own misery. Hold on. What's this? It's the last of my savings. It should cover the cost of the car. I'm drowning in human kindness. Damn it. Take the money. You haven't heard a word I've said since we met, have you? The best gratuity you could show me is friendship. If money meant anything to me... I wouldn't have left the mansion and plane behind. Seems to me you haven't traveled as far as you think. My God! That girl does resemble Marilyn. For a moment, she actually had me fooled. I like that in a woman. I thought you would. It got a pretty good reaction, you know. "Remember the King!" That's great. And that accent. Have you ever seen anyone so convinced he was Elvis? Convinced? What's there to doubt? Oh, I'm so sorry. Save the song and dance for the show, Miss Monroe. I'm always one for enjoying humor at my expense. Especially from one so beautiful. Very smooth. I like it. Thank you. Friends, these are those kind guests I was telling you about. Elvis, this is Corey and Connie. That's Al. He's a lawyer from L.A. This is Sheldon, who runs a chain of carpet stores in Oregon. And that's his wife Pam. I think you met Gene. He's the casino entertainment director. And I'm actually Giles. "A rose by any other name would still smell as sweet." Thank you. This is Byron Gruman. Yes, we're quite intimate already. I'm in shock that you're not in Graceland this time of the year. It's been murder trying to find a good Elvis during the annual vigil. It's true. Although with a little mousse, this one might do the trick. - Don't you think? - Only one of us is headed to Memphis. Excuse me. I have to pick up my car. - Forgive my friend. - Sure. Hold on, Burn! Where're you goin'? The party was just gearing up. Those people can help you to where you're going quicker than I can. You still don't believe a thing I've told you about myself, do you? You want me to lie to you? Of course not. But give me one last chance to prove myself. Step outside for a spell, and I swear, when you return... I'll have evidence even you can't question. What are you scheming now? Just help me out this once. Besides, I happen to know your car won't be ready till morning. See anything you like? Is this yours? When the payments are met, which isn't always. So, if you moonlight as a thief, may I suggest the guest parking lot? No, I'm just curious. You passed us on the road the past couple days. I pass a lot of people. You mean you make passes at a lot of people. Comes with the job. Let me ask you something. When you faint in casinos, do you kiss every man that revives you? Actually, that was a first. But I've learned to trust my impulses. Did you ever think someone might not want to be kissed? Isn't every American male attracted to Marilyn Monroe? Great. Another deranged soul. Is there something you wanted? Nothing. That's what I thought. Look... I didn't mean to be cold. It's just that I didn't think life could get any stranger. Now I find myself stuck in Mississippi... the only person sane enough to recall his own name. It's cooler inside. There's a beer in the fridge if you want it. What's the deal with your father? He takes his Elvis pretty seriously. He's not my father. He sort of attached himself to me. He cries in his sleep. I imagine he's been through some sort of tragedy... but I can't seem to get a straight answer out of him. I've seen a good deal of tragedy among impersonators. Without the gear, you hardly look like Marilyn Monroe. I know. Spooky, isn't it? Lipstick and wigs. I actually happened to be singing once at happy hour... and a guy said I sounded like Marilyn, so I bought that ticket out. Don't you find living in here a bit cramped? I'm only in here a few months out of the year. Usually I'm pretty much booked solid in Vegas. Besides, this thing's got character. Don't you think what a person drives reveals a lot about them? One time in my life I thought that. Before you wrecked that Caddy? How'd you know? The second I saw you in the Casino, I recognized you from the road. Kind of hard to forget. I thought to myself... "There's a soul who looks like he's suffered." Maybe that's why I kissed you. Suffering can really make a person compassionate... and interesting. Though I didn't taste too much life in your lips, I must say. Because my wife died in that car accident. About a year ago in Memphis. Well, I'm sorry. I guess if I were you, I wouldn't be rushing back to Tennessee... let alone kissing strangers dressed up like the dead. What is it about impersonators... that makes everything you say sound like philosophy? I don't know. Everybody needs guidance. What difference does it make if you get it from Jesus, Buddha or Elvis? I don't want to keep you. Thanks for the talk. Sure. What's a performer without a fan? I'm an idiot. Casanova returns. Barkeep. Something tropical. Are you drunk? Me? Not quite. Just nursing a bad case of jitters is all. I tell you, the closer I get to Memphis... the farther away it just seems to get. At least we have that in common. What? Marilyn didn't ease your burden none? How would she do that? Come now. I saw you two heading in the same direction. I guess she's attractive. I loved someone like that once. The type that would gamble their life on a whim. And that's bad? If they lose. Burn... when we buried my mama... I tried jumping into the grave after her as well. She was all I lived for. My best girl. Then one day in Germany I met this young lady. She wasn't like so many of the rest of them. I guess most of them were overawed by me... by what I was supposed to be. But with this chick, it was different. She never gave the impression at all she was tongue-tied... and I was hooked. Now, nobody will ever replace my mama... but I swear, letting myself get close to another warm soul... filled a great void in me. Hypothetically... if I was interested in her... what would you suggest I do? Crooning always did wonders for me. You forgot this. That's for you. A ticket to the mother of all comebacks. You performing here? As the crow flies. This isn't gonna prove you're Elvis. I defy anyone who sees me tonight to call me a fraud. He's not so good in a crowd But when you get him alone You'd be surprised He isn't much at a dance But when he takes you home You'd be surprised He doesn't look like much of a lover Don't judge a book by its cover He's got the face of an angel but There's a devil in his eye He's such a delicate thing But when he starts in the squeeze You'd be surprised He doesn't look very strong But when you sit on his knee You would be surprised At a party or at a ball I've got to admit he's nothing at all But in an easy chair You'd be surprised He doesn't look like much of a lover Don't judge a book by its cover 'Cause he's got the face of an angel but There's a devil in his eyes He doesn't say very much But when he starts in to speak You'd be surprised He's not so good at the start But at the end of the week You would be surprised On a streetcar or on a train You'd think he was born without any brain But in a taxicab And when he start to grab I said a taxicab You would be surprised This one's a real danger Ladies and gentlemen, Marilyn. Before the Hollywood Casino brings on its next legend... I have a message for a very important guest... Mr. Byron Gruman. Would you come backstage? Come on up. It's very important. It can't wait. We'll be right back. Thank you. We'll be back with Elvis. - There you are. - What's going on? See for yourself. Hey, Burn. How long has he been like this? About an hour. I've seen it before. He's afraid to go on. I don't care if he lives or he dies. I advanced you $600 for an Elvis. You're his manager. Manage him. Give him some coffee. - He said I managed him? - That's right. I should've left you in Texas. Now get up! Where's the money? Lost it. Roulette. I don't give a damn. If he's not on stage soon, I'm calling the police. And both of you are going down for fraud. You got it? Fraud? Get up! Come on, get up. Come on. There you go. All right. Burn... I can't. I know. Look. I never told you this before... but Beatrice knew everything about Elvis. She told me that the first time he was on stage, he was scared to death. He didn't know what all the yelling was about, that his body was moving. So when he went off stage and asked his manager, he said... "What'd I do? What'd I do?" Know what he said? "Whatever it is--" "Go back out there and do it again." Right. I know you're not Elvis. And I know you're scared to death, but if you don't go out there... you're gonna see a violent side of me that you never even dreamed of. You look good. Fine. Come on, let's go. Come on. - Here. - I can't do this. You're gonna do it, believe me. Take this and do it. Go ahead. Go ahead. Get him out there. You're gonna be great, Elvis. If you forget any words, do some karate. This crowd will love it. Hailing from Memphis, Tennessee, our final legend... the King of Rock and Roll! We're caught in a trap I can't walk out Because I love you too much Baby Why can't you see What you're doing to me When you don't believe a word I'm saying We can't go on together With suspicious minds And we can't build our dreams On suspicious minds So if an old friend I know Drops by to say hello Would I still see suspicion In your eyes So here we go again Asking where I've been Can't you see these tears are real I'm trying We can't go on together With suspicious minds And we can't build our dreams On suspicious minds Oh, let our love survive I'll dry the tears from your eyes Let's don't let a good thing die 'Cause, honey You know I'd never lie to you Oh, no Oh, Jesus, Mary and Joseph. I'm broiling alive. Are you all right? You were great! Watch his head. Is he okay? You all right? - What is it? - I think he's just dehydrated. Let's get him to your trailer. Call the paramedics. I want to check his case, see if there's any medication. Help me get him up. You should've seen it. Two thousand screaming fans. But don't worry. I'll send you all tickets to the next one. How's the patient? I think we can save him if he'd stop talking for a minute. I've never been so insulted. - Can I talk to you alone? - Sure. - Did you find anything in his case? - More than I was looking for. Here. "Marian and Lilli Burrows... wife and daughter of local businessman Jon Burrows... were confirmed to be... fatalities aboard yesterday's ill-fated flight bound for Memphis. Friends expressed concern for Mr. Burrows who they described... as a generous philanthropist known to entertain with his renditions... of the music of Elvis Presley who passed on early yesterday as well." - Oh, no. - It's incredible. There must be something we can do. Maybe if you take him home. What do you say, Doctor? What's the prognosis? There's nothing wrong that an immediate red-eye to Graceland won't cure. You arrange for a chaperone? - You're looking at him. - You? Why, I've never seen such an act of selfless generosity in all my days. In that case... I do declare my next set of sandwiches... will have Memphis written all over them. Heaven help me. I do love those sandwiches. You were great! We loved it. Miss Ashley, Burn and l can't thank you enough... for the pre-coffee delivery. It was my pleasure. You two just say your farewells, and I'll check on the car's progress. Maybe you can call around, see if any of the Burrows family is in Memphis. All right. Look me up if you ever find your way through Nevada, okay? I'm just trying to survive Memphis. We did it, boys. Look at him. Ladies and gentlemen... the car of cars. What the hell did you do? Brought out the beauty that was lurking beneath this baby's pained exterior. What do you think? Quite a vision now, isn't she? The car is beautiful! How did you pay for this? It don't matter. Consider it a donation from some very generous technicians. It's like new. You're gifted. Anything to get the King of Rock and Roll home in style. See, Miss Ashley, my efforts are flowering. A day ago, this boy threatened to kill anybody that came close to this vehicle. What a difference a day makes. Hop in, Burn. Leave now when we can reach my heavenly home by noon. - Thank you. - You got it, Burn. Thank you all. Miss Ashley, it was a pleasure making your acquaintance. Come on by Graceland someday soon. I'd be honored. Remember the King! Kind of hard to forget him. Burn, I got to tell you something. This ain't the first time I've tried coming home. Honestly, I've held up that cardboard sign around my birthday... just about every year in the past 20 now. Only I've never come this close before. Guess I owe it to my chance meeting with you... a man who shares as much history with this town as I do. So promise me something. What's that? If I turn and run, shoot me in the back. I'll be right behind you. The tour is closed in preparation for the vigil tonight, gentlemen. I understand. But this man here claims to be Elvis. Is that right? Sorry I'm late. It's been a long road home. I'm sorry, sir. There must be some mistake. The line forms at 7:00. Why not come back then and we'll try to bump you to the front of it. I guess that ends that. Ends what? The boys used to play this game with me all the time. Lock me out... testing how long it took for me to break into my own home. And you can bet right now they're in the dining room... laughing their heads off at our expense. We'll show 'em. Back out of here. Here. Please, don't do this. I don't wanna get arrested again. I've gotten you this far safely, haven't l? I'm insane. Shit. Hello? I'm home. Maybe we should go. Don't be silly. Just look surprised when they jump out. Something don't feel right. There's nobody here. I saw your clipping about the plane crash. Son... you really bought that tale? Hell, I had that thing printed up ages ago. Like yourself, some folks need me to have a more believable identity... before they can accept my sympathy. Everything about this trip... fixing the car, getting arrested, meeting Ashley... you planned it all, didn't you? One never knows what's chance and what's fate till the ride is over. So why don't we turn this car around, and finish what we started? You sure this is where they are? They? Your wife and child. That's not who we're here for. How'd you know she was here? That's a long story. Let's just say I met a trucker once who used to drive a train. Travel as much as I do, and you're bound to come across... two people that have been touched by the same tragedy. I can't believe I never came here before. We all travel at our own pace, Byron. And you've nothing to feel guilty about. After all, you didn't really kill Beatrice, did you? I wasn't even drivin'. See, in my head, I see myself behind that wheel. But it was her. Beatrice was drivin'. She just wanted to kiss me. God, if I'd been drivin'-- She might be alive? Or you might be dead. Maybe both of you would have perished. How could something so perfect be taken away from me? I've searched a lifetime for an answer to that question. All I know is you have to forgive yourself... the woman... God... and have faith that the next love you know won't cause you so much pain. My God! Will you look at this glorious congregation? I'm sorry there wasn't a party for you. Right. But I'm sure it was just a mistake. Anyway, it doesn't matter. I never dreamed I'd be this loved by so many. To these people I'm home. And I guess it should remain that way for them... and maybe for my own sake. Sometimes a man has to give up what's dearest to him to find peace. What will you do now? Keep moving, I guess. I always thought I'd ride a train a while. And what about you? Where are you headed? I was thinking about going west... visiting a woman in Vegas. Listen, why don't you let me take you back west a few states? Thank you, but no. You've already gone too far out of your way these past couple of days. I don't know what I would've done if you hadn't come along. I was pretty close to doing something. I know. And I hope those thoughts are nothing but distant memories. It's taken all my strength... but I believe you're right. One last question. What's my name? What'd I tell you? It's never too late for a comeback. I'll be right back. What a perfect surprise. Can you believe this? This is amazing. Elvis lives. What are you doing here? I really didn't know what else to do. I couldn't find the Burrows family anywhere near Memphis. I tried calling information. I even checked the public library, and nothing. Well, maybe we missed something in that clipping. - Do you still have it? - No. What's the matter? Elvis. Remember the King. Remember the King! Friend, I gotta tell you. It's been a long time since I rode in the belly of a boxcar. Let me introduce myself. The name's Elvis.
