From a collection of the Russian State Film Foundation We are fed up with heavenly sweets give us a huge loaf of rye bread to eat! We are fed up with paper passions let us live with a living wife! We exist! Today, above the dust of theaters our motto will shine: "From a clean slate!" Lo and behold! A curtain Mystery Bouffe Prepared by Vladimir Mayakovsky Played by actors, musicians and colored by painters Hear ye, Hear ye Come in, people Listen people Now before your very eyes - the noblest nobles - athletes will strut by in well-matched pairs: they're here to eliminate each other Parade Allez! Look, young and old, nephews and nieces, aunts and uncles! All eyes open wide! See! Look, first row Look, second and third Look, fourth and fifth too a more disgusting mug you'll never see Spotting a bourgeois is easy We know their kind! Fat and short in height and with a cigar in his mouth Even the youngest specimen puts in a gold tooth And that is a speculator, our countryman 175 pounds of fine flour he lifts with one hand He bears high the fine flour, while bearing down on us with it Manufacture Colonialism Market It's easy to spot a merchant Consult any propaganda material Here's a merchant - horribly fat wearing pleated boots Neither proletarian, nor non-proletarian neither capitalist, nor non-capitalist Inch by inch, he creeps before everyone like a worm Aristocrat Aristocrat And here's an aristocrat Clean shaven, funny haircut A disgusting sight While over bold patches rises a top hat that matches This is a priest for his prayers he gobbled down almost the whole grain harvest Introductions are finished All these gentlemen have arrived to get at each other's throats for the sake of profit And you - what are your nationalities? We're a roving band, used to wandering through the world we have no nationality: labor is our native land We're a roving band, used to wandering through the world we have no nationality: labor is our native land We're a roving band, used to wandering through the world we have no nationality: labor is Our native land The gist of Act One is as follows: the world is leaking The War Is Declared Evening Paper! Evening Paper, Evening Paper! Evening Paper, Evening Paper, Evening Paper! And on The square blackened gloomily by poor a crimson stream of blood has flooded! The North Pole is flooded, the last refuge is gone So they all begin building, not just an Ark but a great big super-duper one The public takes a trip on the ark: here you'll find both autocracy and a democratic republic A man and a woman Woe is me Woe is me I remember how the whole family used to gather round the table for tea the muffins the caviar Gentlemen! Since we are all so immaculate, is it fitting that we should work and sweat? Let's make The Unclean work for us I'm all for that! But what can I do? I'm delicate And each of them has the strength of two Oh, there'll be no fight - God forbid! We'll have no mayhem But while they're gobbling up their meal while they're drinking and hollering we'll cook up a deal to betray them We'll give them a king! A king A king A king Why a king? Because the king will hand down A DECREE The Czar, frightened, issued a manifesto: Freedom for the dead, prison for the living That's the Constitution - sugar and honey Freedom for the dead, machine-gunning for the living Smile, mouth, rejoice, people! Freedom for the dead - the opposite... for the living The Czar, frightened, issued a manifesto: Freedom for the dead, prison for the living That's the Constitution - sugar and honey Freedom for the dead, machine-gunning for the living Smile, mouth, rejoice, people! Freedom for the dead - the opposite... for the living. Hey! AUTOCRACY By the grace of God, we, King of all chickens The Unclean fried and Grand Duke of all eggs said chickens have laid without ever having flayed any men seven times we take only six hides, and leave the seventh hereby decree to our subjects: bring in everything - dried bread crumbs, fish, porpoises and all else that suits our purposes for eating The Senate, without delaying a minute, will inspect the heap of foodstuffs you bring, and select the best to regale us and your King And then we'll divide the booty, for such is our Christian duty We hear and obey, Your Majesty What's this? Did a Mongol horde wreak a havoc here? How could one lone man munch all that much? I'd like to give him one good punch in that bulging mug! Silence! I'm anointed by the Lord on High! Do you hear the Guards' spurs jingle: the King has sent the crack unit To the rear, march, Forward, march, Half-right, face Whoever kills freedom-loving people will have honor and fame Hurray! Hurray! Hurray! Fight for the glory of the Czars two-headed eagle Hey! One! Two! Prepare to load! Load! All of Moscow will remember the Red Epaulets! Hurray! Hurray! Hurray!

Fight for the glory of the Russian two-headed eagle! Hey! A curse on him! He looks so sleek! It's cold and damp is the night Gentlemen, you know what? I believe I've turned democrat Well, you don't say! As for me I've always loved the People passionately And who was it proposed we pledge faith to His Majesty? No more poisonous barbs, gentlemen! Autocracy, as a form of government, is undoubtedly obsolete It certainly is, if there's nothing to eat! Seriously, gentlemen! Seriously! Revolution is hatching Let's bury the hatchet and keep things friendly Hurray! Hurray for the Constituent Assembly! Hurray! Hurray! Hurray! Hurray! Citizens! Please come to the meeting Citizen, are you for a republic? A meeting? A republic? What's that? Wait right there. The intellectual will explain some things Citizens!

Down with him! Down with autocracy! A one-off world show! Autocracy Democratic Republic Democratic Republic /fast forwarded, unintelligible/ Comrades, you just can't imagine how delighted I am! No more of those age-old barriers now! Congratulations! Ancient social foundations have collapsed The rest will arrange itself easily the rest is a snap Now we're for you, and you're for us Well, citizens, that's enough. You've romped to your heart's content Now let's set up our democratic government Citizens, in order to make this easy and quick, we will be ministers and deputy ministers and you, citizens of a democratic republic, will bake rolls, make boots, and hunt walrus Long live our democratic republic! Comrades, what's this? Before, one mouth chowed; now a regiment claws The republic turned out to be the same thing as a king, but one with a hundred jaws Why so excited? We promised to share things equally, and we've done it one man gets the ring of doughnut, the other man gets the core That's what a democratic republic is for Somebody has to take the seeds, not everyone can have the melon We will show you a class struggle! Hold, citizens! Our policy... Come on! We'll roast 'em on four sides We'll show 'em a policy to remember! Stand fast, damn you! You'll never forget this day in November! Rise! Rise! Rise! Workers and peasants Hold fast, a mower and a smiter, a gun in your iron fists! Flag - upwards! Ragged rise! Foe - down! Day is foul For bread! For peace! For freedom! Take the plants away from the owners Take the lands away from the rich Fraternize with your brothers in arms Enough! Enough! Enough being humble and meek Tremble, lackeys of the capital Quiver, crowns on the foreheads Away with the old Boldly unfold Fight the rich! Bang! Bang! Knife the rich guy on the spot Mister owner, gather your belongings, quick! The time has come step out, in boots or without Sharpen the axes Raise the scythes What Pugachev and Razin started burn and blast with force All the manors of the rich we will set ablaze Set ablaze! Raise the blades! Oh, keep burning with all force, dear fire Famine The Republic ate up the last food supplies Comrades! Kick the weaklings over the side! But come, people, why don't you raise up a cheer? Let's cheer! Cheer? Have you thought about bread? Cheer? And where could we plant grain, anyway? Cheer? With no furrowed fields - only trough in the waves? We've got nothing to fish with - our nets are torn How can a man get across that water? If we just had some dry land near! There's a leak in the ark! De-vas-tation Listen! What's that? Do you hear the music? Who am I? I'm of no class, no nation, no clan I've seen the 30th, the 40th Century I'm simply a person of the future Are you waiting for Ararats? There aren't any Ararats - none! They're just something you saw in a dream And if the mountain doesn't come to Muhammad then to hell with it! Far be it from me to preach of a Christian Heaven where fasting fools lap up unsweetened tea The Heaven I'm shouting about is a genuine, earthly one There, labor is sweet, and won't callus your hands work will bloom in your palms like a rose There, sun will perform such miracles that at every step you will sink down in flower beds big as the sea We'll all go! What's there to lose? But will sinners like us be let in? Come all who are not pack of mules, and all for whom life is cruel and unbearable! My kingdom - earthly, not heavenly - is for you The gaping maw of the gulf bodes ill Only one path remains: through the clouds! Forward! Through the sky - forward! We are ourselves now a loud-thudding prophecy Let's go and try to get us out of despondency Let's go let's catch our last chance There victors can rest up after the fray Though our feet may be tired, we'll make shoes from the sky For our bleeding feet, we'll make shoes from the sky! Heaven's gates are flung wide! Up ladders of sunbeams and stairs of rainbows! Up ladders of sunbeams and swings of rainbows Enough prophets! We're all Nazarenes! Climb up the masts! Grab hold of the yards! To the masts! To the shrouds! In the Third Act we show and tell how the workers have nothing to be afraid of - not even the devils in Hell Hell What's that looming there? A mast Why a mast? What mast? Quiet, you devil! Cut the crap! Run and notify Beelzebub and his staff Is this hell? Hell Comrades, don't stop! We'll go straight ahead! Come off it! "Come of it!" did you say? I did. You should be ashamed An old devil like you, with gray hairs on your head As if you could scare us that way! Have you ever visited a foundry, by any chance? A foundry? I've not had the pleasure Just as I though! If you had, you'd have shed your fur In this place you live like some fancy-pants So sleek! Yet acting tough! And you think we're scared? So you've kindled your petty fires! So you've hung your pots up! Fine devils you are! Why, you're no more than pups! Laugh till it brings tears to your eyes! We show the bowers of Paradise Well, aren't they in view yet? The edge of that cloud has begun to swell suspiciously Here they come! Here they come! Can it really be they? They're in Paradise, yet they have the look of chimney sweeps covered with soot We'll scrub it away Ugh. Not all saints, one would gather, are of the same feather Drop in quick - make yourself slick! Barbershop I strolled hither, I strolled thither building bridge into socialism I'm not finished, I got tired and I paused to sit in quiet One time and one more time and many many other times Grass is growing, Sheep are passing We desire - it's so simple - just repose near this river One time and one more time and many many other times That's enough! Down on earth, people humbly resign themselves to death, hoping to see you If they only knew what lies ahead Down there, paradises like yours are a dime a dozen! We never thought it would be like this! What's to talk about? Let's wreck the joint! This is one institution where we don't belong The Promised Land! Seek it somewhere beyond Paradise! With our seven-league strides we'll plow up Paradise! Let's go and plow up the whole universe! We break, we break and we break the clouds Isn't it time we got past them? How long till our weary bodies are bathed in the freshness of May? Where to? Won't we land in another Hell? We've been duped - and duped well And what comes next? The farther we go, the worse it gets Chimney sweep, go out ahead and scout! This way, comrades! This way! Disembark for the landing! The factories are all festooned with banners, mile upon mile Wherever the hundred-legged worm of my gaze turns, I see, decked in flowers the joiner's bench and the lathe standing idle Standing? Idle? And here we are, getting in trim via verbal athletics! We may have rain that will rust the machines! Break in! Shout! Hey! Who's there? It's dear mother earth! Our own native soil! I'd like a saw. I'm young Take it And I'd like a needle My hands itch to work. Give me a hammer! Take it, caress it! In the last Act comes the Commune Everyone must sing out at the top of their voice! Look as hard as you can! Why did we bellow like oxen under the yoke? We waited and waited and waited for years and never once did we notice all the blessings right under our noses! Why do folks go to museums, anyway? All around us, treasures are heaped high Is that the sky or a piece of bright-colored cloth? If this is the work of our own hands, what door will not open before us? We are the architects of earths, the decorators of planets We're miracle-makers We'll tie rays of light into bundles and use them as brooms to sweep the clouds from the sky with electricity We'll make the rivers of many worlds splash honey We'll pave the street on this earth with stars Dig! Gouge! Saw! Bore! All shout "Hurray" Sun-worshipers in the temple of this world, let's show them by example how we can sing Form into choruses for a psalm to the Sun!
