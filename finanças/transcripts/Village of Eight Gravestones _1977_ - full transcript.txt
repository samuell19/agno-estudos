That's all about this father of yours The Tajimi Family will tell you more about it But it so happens that he isn't at the house right now Like 20 years ago It was when I was 5 or 6. That must have been About 22 or 23 years ago Your father is working now at a place far away Your mother must have been pretty Those who knew her say so She looked somewhat lonesome at times Docile by nature Most people feel loneliness Your mother must have been very docile I wonder Why didn't she tell me more about her birthplace? Besides deep in the mountains of Okayama? I think my son will meet us at the station in his car The Tajimis' car also You must be tired See you tomorrow The Tajimi house The villagers call it the East House It's in the east My house in the west is the West House That mountain, this mountain, the mountains over there They're all owned by the Tajimi Family Except one mountain donated 30 years ago By the Tajimis to the village Do I sound like a guide? Listen, Tatsuya I met my late husband at a Tokyo university I liked him Didn't think about marriage But during summer vacation when we stood at this pass I felt that I was fated to live here My whole life to be spent in this village I don't mean you should stay here too That road in front is better. Remember it Following amalgamation, the village was renamed Before that it was known As the Village of 8 Gravestones 8 Gravestones? Welcome back It's a curse! The wrath of the deity of 8 Graves It's a curse?Ka curse! Ushimatsu Igawa isn't the only one 8 will die in all! Tatsuya, the countryside is different from a city There are many long continuing traditions and customs The Tajimis are an old family Your half brother and half sister Thank you for all your trouble I've lived alone since I was a boy There's no use meeting my in-laws now They'd be strangers I'll return to Tokyo after the funeral The Tajimi house I'm the one who should have gone I happened to be in Osaka Tatsuya, this is your elder sister Haruyo We've been waiting for you Where will he meet his grandaunts? After your phone call, there was much discussion About which room would be appropriate They finally decided on this room Grandaunts Tatsuya This is grandaunt Koume. That is Kotake This is Tatsuya I'm Tatsuya Koume, blood can never be disputed, can it? How true His eyes, the shape of his mouth exactly like Tsuruko's Should he meet Hisaya now? Hisaya is very sick today They'd better meet tomorrow I'll be leaving then Dine with us to celebrate Tatsuya's return I've phoned the West House that you would Tatsuya We live in a remote area but it's convenient We can eat sea bream like this nowadays In the old days, tiny dried fish was all we were able to get How is Hisaya's condition recently? He's being treated by Dr. Kuno who's nothing but a quack Why not select an Okayama hospital or some other doctor? Kuno may have a poor reputation But he's a relative. We can't just brush him aside Tatsuya, you've probably heard and know how things are Hisaya's condition isn't good Haruyo married once too, but it failed. She was sent back Operated on to remove the womb She'll never be able to give birth to a child You're the only one Whom we can depend upon now, Tatsuya Excuse me I have a drawing of the mountains ready Tatsuya You've just arrived but we'd like to have you learn the work Can't that be done later? It's because Tatsuya must be very tired today Of course. There's Igawa's funeral tomorrow too You can go I understand Speaking of Ushimatsu Igawa, I feel sorry for him Who could have done such a terrible thing? Kanji should have been sent. At Ushimatsu's age He must have wanted to see Tatsuya retire early Well, then, Kotake. We should let Tatauya retire early The annex has been cleaned Everything's just as when you lived there as a child I've never been that annex. I'll take a look later That'll be fine, Miyako No use hurrying home There's no one waiting for you there Remember anything? Where's the place called Dragon's Jaws? Dragon's Jaws? In the stalactite cave? A cave? Many tunnels under this village I never heard that time Neither have I I'll be leaving then Thank you for all your help See you at the funeral Would you like to watch television? No. I feel quite tired tonight I'll go and prepare your bed The place where you were born Dragon's Jaws Dragon's Jaws Remember that Memorial tablet... Kanji Igawa Murderer! That one's a murderer! A curse! Wrath of the deity of Graves! A rain of blood! He's a murderer! Be quiet! Stop this nonsense Murderer? The deity of 8 Graves? The 8 Graves are up there Kawakami Cave... Designated As Natural Monument Long, long ago 400 years in the past In the age of civil wars, 8 fugitive warriors came here Are you relating the history of this village? You won't mind if I listen too? 8 warriors of the Amako Clan. Defeated by the Morri Clan Led by Yoshitaka Amako from is now Hirose, Shimane area They shuttled down around there At first the villages feared the warriors Vigilance was maintained But the 8 were neither unruly nor violent They turned waste land into field Cultivated upland rice and vegetables They become more farmers than warriors The villagers ceased to be anxious Mutual contact came to be established It really amazes me But the Morri Clan's inquiry came even to this remote district If there are any fugitive warriors, produce them A big reward offered for capturing Yoshitaka Amako 4 villages representatives held a series of discussions The 8 men were invited to the summer festival Held at the very spot where we are now standing Welcome to the festival Poison put in the Sake? Oh, this cowardly... sneak attack! I curse you for all eternity! It'll never affect me! Any sign of the curse after that? The man who conceived the plot The youngest village representative, Shozaemon Founded the present Tajimi Family As the ringleader of the attack He was rewarded by the Morri Clan with extensive forestland He became a very wealthy man One day Shozaemon suddenly became demented After killing several villagers He finally cut off his own head Cut off his own head? Lighting flashed just then How many villagers died at that time? 8 including Shozaemon Exactly 8? The tutelary deity's shrine was transferred to this spot So stained with blood The villagers said it was all due to the curse The 8 warriors' strewn corpses were brought here respectfully Given a decent burial A small shrine was built to honor them That's the small shrine? For the 8 warriors' graves? Tatsuya Before meeting Hisaya, you'll be introduced to relatives Why, Mr. Kudo! This is Tatsuya The school principal I'm Tatsuya Kudo of the school Excuse me I wanted to know the village history I learned about it from her That's Miyako of the West House West House? A beautiful woman but she lost her husband. She's a widow Since you've already heard the history Do you want to see the stalactite cave? Before that, tell me more about the killing of the warriors Shozaemon Tajimi was one of the 4 village representatives What were the names of the other 3 men? The son of your father's younger brother That makes him your cousin I'm Tsunesaburo Kuno Tatsuya Tsunesaburo, are you running for assemblyman again next year? I hear your clinic is very busy nowadays This village only has one doctor Pay more attention to your practice Don't throw money away the way you've been doing I did quite well in the last election I'll be elected this time I ask for your support Mori of the West House. Your father's cousin I'm Sokichi Mori Tatsuya Sokichi, you'll age quickly, puttering around with dwarf trees Pay more attention to forestry and lumbering You should think more about the future Or you won't be able to continue Then there's Miyako. She's still young and pretty The life she's leading is that of a half-dead young widow Enable her to leave the West House as early as possible In the trucking business at Niimi He's the son of your father's cousin Taichiro Yoshioka I'm Yoshioka Come and see me at Niimi I've something to discuss with you Taichiro The tunnels under this village will never be profitable You might be counting on Tajimi money for your project Not one yen will be given for such a venture In scale and variety It can be developed into a national tourist attraction But aside from the problem of funds Tajimi Family's land is involved. I want to talk to you about that Tatsuya? You've met all the relatives? Tatsuya has returned from Tokyo Different mothers, but he is my brother Listen, Tatsuya When in Rome do as the Romans do. Be well liked Above all, see to it That no one steals the Tajimi fortune The Tajimi Family has found a worthy heir Everyone must feel relieved Medicine! Give me medicine! Leave it to us We've taken care of Hisaya all along Doctor He's dead The excitement proved too much for him A funeral today and another one tomorrow? It's the day after tomorrow The East House would like it early But there are business connections In weather like this, what will happen To the corpse? Nothing for you to worry about The East House is buying lots of dry ice Dry ice? Someone always makes a profit When death occurs. Old people pay money To drive away calamity It's the curse! Curse of the deity of the 8 Graves! Excuse me We're from the prefectural police Who is in responsibility for this funeral? My name is Isokawa There are some suspicious about Hisaya's death Take a look at this Surely you're not planning an autopsy here Well, you see The death certificate and burial permit are in order Do you have any proof? An autopsy here is irregular It should be done at Okayama I agree, but the expert conducting the autopsy Is Prof. Oi of Okayama U. Medical Department So this will be a formal judicial autopsy Ushimatsu Igawa's case hasn't been solved yet Are you attached to the police force? Not exactly with the police Something similar Isokawa, what will the result of the autopsy be? You insisted on having an autopsy, Kindaichi I thought it necessary too. That's why But the result. When will the result be fully known? It'll be clear tomorrow morning Tatsuya! What's happened? My brother Hisaya's in the cave Impossible! What do you mean? Didn't know about this? The grandaunts together? On the night when I arrived. Last night again Let's go Tatsuya This isn't Brother No! It's none other than our father... yours and mine Help! Your mother? Yes, but With this Everything fits in Father killed 32 villagers Then fled into the mountains The police mobilized men from neighboring villages combed the hills An extensive search was made inside the cave too He was not found He was finally considered to be missing. But he died here He became like a waxed mummy because of adipocere After escaping into the cave, he must have returned home To put on this armor The grandaunts must have hidden him here Bringing him food from time to time I'm scared! Because Father was demented He might go into the village and kill again So the grandaunts must have put poison in his food I'm frightened! Father's madness was Caused by your mother When she left, taking you with her When? To Osaka today, then from Itami by JAL? Take this with you I made it especially for you I want you to stay No one competent is left here now Stay for Brother's 7th day. Don't be angry at Miyako of the West House You were bound to know Please don't tell Tatsuya About Father He might not come I was the one who asked Miyako not to Tatsuya! Father's madness was caused by your mother When she left the Tajimi house, taking you with her. Get out! Go away! You bring a rain of blood Curse of the 8 Graves! Murderer! He's a murderer Trying to kill me! Help me Murderer! He's a murderer He's a murderer! Murderer! He's trying to kill me What's going on? Trying to kill me Tatsuya Tajimi? I'm Tatsuya Terada Come to the police station for questioning I don't have much time to spare Depends on how well you cooperate Let's go I know nothing about strychnine The same poison killed both Ushimatsu Igawa and Hisaya Tajimi You were at the scene both times The Osaka police investigated my grandfather's death What I want to know now is who gave medicine to Hisaya? Grandaunt One of the other of the two grandaunts How was the medicine selected? How should I know? Others were around Ask some of them The villages Won't tell the truth I'm leaving! Wait! I came here To see my mother's birthplace Learn about my father I've found out more than enough. Leaving? Several things have come to light already Your real father Wasn't Yozo Tajimi It was someone else My investigation isn't completed yet I don't know the name But you are not the son of Yozo Tajimi, the slayer of 32 That much is absolutely certain The question That is most important Was Yozo Tajimi really my father or wasn't he? Tatsuya Let's go over there The day before Father left for Osaka to meet you I was weeding there Father came and said he had something to tell me I'm leaving for Osaka. I don't know if it's really Tatsuya But the real Tatsuya is bound to come here someday I'm growing old. There's something you should know After Tsuruko was taken to the Tajimis And 100 days after Tatsuya's birth I was weeding here, just as you're doing now When I looked up Tsuruko must have wanted to bring the baby home But the way she had been taken to the Tajimis And what the villagers would think Yet, she wanted to pray for the child's happiness Even if by herself alone The child, in holiday clothes, was taken to a shrine I understood exactly how Tsuruko was feeling As I watched her from afar, I cried Just then, Kanji, someone tapped me on the shoulder It was the school principal, Kudo Kudo said that The baby carried by Tsuruko was not Yozo Tajimi's child Kudo said he could not Reveal the real father's name or particulars just then The Tajimis are rich But Yozo's tainted blood does not flow on Tatsuya I possess full knowledge about it That child will eventually grow up to be a splendid person At that time, Ushimatsu Instead of Tsuruko alone Let us both offer prayers For that child's... for Tsuruko's happiness. The school? This is Miyako of the West House Could I talk to the principal? The principal? This is Miyako There's something I want to ask you Can I call on you from now? What! To Okayama? 10 or 20 minutes will be enough I'll go there at once I know you're extremely busy but Can you drive? As to who and what this man was I'll tell you two when I return from Okayama Yes, but The entire circumstances cannot be related in 5 or 10 minutes I'm sure you'll realize that When are you scheduled to return? Education Commission first Then an editorial meeting for compiling a local history The problem is how to divide the book I'll probably be returning 3 or 4 days from now It can't be helped I must start out now The Tajimi Family is probably unaware of this and so Please keep it just to yourselves Have you ever heard of Dragon's Jaws? Dragon's Jaws? The 3 main rooms are partitioned Everybody can easily come here This is how the capsules How many strychnine capsules were prepared? Health Center prepared them 3 years ago Scattered since then in many districts People remember the size but not the number All that Dr. Kuno says is that they've been used up entirely We know both Ushimatsu Igawa and Hisaya Tajimi were killed Despite a difference in dissolution By poison coming from this clinic Should we arrest him as a suspect? Appear voluntarily? Can't get a warrant yet Listen What is it? Do you think?K It's because of the curse as the old people are saying? A curse? 8 killed 400 years ago, 32 slain 28 years ago That's 4 times as many Multiplied by 4 this time would be 128! Counted the households and population 128 people are living in this village right now Will all of them... 128... be killed? Reading too many mysteries Where has Kindaichi gone? Kenji Kawai... a real tragedy All 5 of the family killed. No survivors Next is Yaichi Koyama. His family met the same fate Kindaichi! What's going on? There were entire families wiped out by Yozo Tajimi What happened here was a terrible tragedy This isn't like you With an entire family wiped out No one would be left to seek revenge Yes, of course. That's true enough Instead of that death register I have a complete record of the case Why not study that? That's exactly what I'll do Not a grudge against Yozo's mass slaying 28 years ago The curse is a ruse to usurp the fortune Prime suspect is Dr. Kuno I was thinking along the same lines I'm leaving the village for awhile What about the request made to you by lawyer Suwa? I'm not forgetting it. There's money involved You're thinking about the reward? Suwa is concerned A murder took place in his office Didn't you agree to investigate until the case is solved? That's absolutely correct But I have other work to do I'll be back very soon I want to question the principal but he's in Okayama now Dr. Kuno knows that the police are watching him He'll lie low for some time I'll be missing the festival here I had looked forward to it Really easygoing, aren't you? Haruyo, what's that tray for? It's for Tatsuya. In the annex Why there? Why do you do such a thing, Haruyo? It's nice to have a change You're pampering Tatsuya too much He was talking today about going away Don't continue treating him as a special guest After all, Kotake He started to leave once but Miyako's intercession Brought him back here He may try to leave but he won't be able to He'll settle down here and work That is, if he has discrimination About how to get along in life Did Yozo Tajimi know? Perhaps he was aware that the child was not his Doesn't matter now Information About An Individual Sought At Kainan City, Wakayama Prefecture Search Extended To Gokurakuji Temple, Shiotsu Tennoji Station, Osaka Lake Biwa Ishiyamadera, Shiga Prefecture Kyoto Higashi Honganji Temple Forestry assets worth billions of yen They mean nothing to you When your real father is known and Dragon's Jaws It's back to Tokyo for you
