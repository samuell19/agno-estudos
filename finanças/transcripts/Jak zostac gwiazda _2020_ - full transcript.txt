NETFLIX PRESENTS This was meant to sound like a confession? Had it been addressed to me... if I'd been the object of your moans, pardon me, sighs... I'd make sure we'd never meet again. Take my advice and find something else in life, something you can actually do. Because you surely can't... sing. You're a washout. What a flop. Didn't I tell you? She sang: It was me... Instead of: It was me! -I'm with Olo. -He's awesome. -He's old. -He's a pro. And he's smart. -Do you know one song by him? -"Dark Night"! Hello! -Ewa Dykta is awesome. -Dykty. Her name is Dykty. -And she's lame. -And fat. -Fat my ass! -Her ass, you mean. -And she's got small tits. -Awesome tits. -What? -Small. -Awesome small tits. -And she can't sing. -She's got 300,000 followers. -Of her tits. -Since she's got them... -She hasn't! It's not the end of the auditions for the Music Race. Next week, a special bonus edition of our show in which head of jury Olo Zawistowski will face his past. Our musical cruise will visit Olo's hometown, Rozalin. -Music Race, a race to the stars! -Wake me up! I'm not dreaming! Ostra, what's wrong? -Music Race crap! -What? A moronic show for morons, with morons! The show's not going to Rozalin, get it? -Olo, relax. -I'm not going back to that shithole. Not a shithole. Olo's coming home. It's moving. Home, to a small town, one of a thousand. Olo comes closer to Joe Sixpack, gaining in popularity. I don't need more fans. If it hadn't been for me, no one would know you outside of the dinner circuit. I know TV is a drag, the camera adds ten kilos. I'll take you fishing and you'll chill. But a deal is a deal, right? And what was the deal? The deal was that we do the show, get ratings that go through the roof. My show on my terms, right? And then we do your album. On your terms. You'll be an artist all you want then. Listening to that stuff... with your family. You prick! What's up? -Where are you? -I'm coming. -Which hashtag for Rozalin sounds better-- -What? Olo returns, Olo's return, Olo's back-- "God-Olo-mighty's back!" Brilliant, right? Olo? Hello? -You two should meet and talk. -Why? -You've got a kid with him. -I told him 18 years ago. When he was wasted and puked all over his mic. -Mom! -They all puke on their mics. You should've sued him for alimony, maybe he'd sober up. Mom! He's getting old, sentimental. He wants to face his past, he said so himself! -He didn't. -All right, the host said it. But if he's such a total jerk, would he agree to come to this dump? He wants to get in touch with you! So I'm to come up and say, "Excuse me, we have a kid?" And why not? Do you know how much he makes on that TV show? -I don't want his money! -I don't want his money! Hungry? You should invite him for dinner. I read he likes Silesian dumplings. -Marta likes them too. -Grandma! And if he denies it, we'll check his DNA. -From his saliva. -How? We'll sample a dumpling. I read about it. How about you ask me if I want to meet him? Do you? No. And no. See? She doesn't want it. And I have a feeling she does. Very much. -You drew this for him, remember? -Burn it. He never got it. -Maybe Grandma's right. -I don't want his money! This is not about money. He's your father. He's an asshole who left you with a brat. But thanks to him, I've got this brat... who, at times, is a likable brat. -He was talented, he had to leave. -Don't defend him, it's useless! I just want you to be happy. I'll be happy when you're happy. DAD And now Olo Zawistowski's hit, "Dark Night"! Olo... Eyes on the GPS. Turn left in 200 meters. God! But the road to the center was... there. You really are a hillbilly. We could've taken a train. To have 200 people singing "Dark Night"? No thanks. Maybe you should write something new. Why are you so nervous? Do you owe people money there? You dumped some ho back there. And you don't want to see her. Yep. She's old and fat, and works at a supermarket. You don't have to, if you don't want to. I don't want to, but you have to. Let's go home? Excuse me. -Morning! -Hello! Can't hear you, I'll call you back, bye. Yes? -Hello. -And bye. No tag, no entry. You go in, just be visible. Everything all right? All hyped? Great. -I work there... -Mom is a teacher. School's out today. Go on, please. This is a film set. -Yes, but we came to see Olo! -Sure. Everyone wants to see him. Excuse me, could you stop fiddling with that mandolin? Thanks. -It's a ukulele. -Stop fiddling with the "ulele." -How can I get this tag? -You're auditioning? -Right. -Fill this out and sign it. Hello? Sixty-eight and 69... next please, great. And the next five get ready. Watch your place in line. I'll call you on my break, if I have one. Pen. Great, bye. Cool. Rock on! -Tag... -Thanks. Hold it! It's five at a time, as they come. I'd say no sooner than... 4:00 p.m. Let's go. Ostrowicz. -Through here? -Come on, Mom! Faculty entering through the basement? Catch! -Ready? -How do I look? Gorgeous! Olo! Oh, God! Can I take a pic? Got it? Hey! You're crazy! -One more. -Go ahead. Remember me? No! Let's move on. Excuse me. Stop. No tag, no entry. -I have to get in. -Tag. Excuse me! -How many calories will you burn? -How many should I burn? We need the host on set! -They're calling me. -Is something wrong? Krzysztof... what is it? I work out! -So handsome. And forever young. -True. Camera on him. Thanks for the warm welcome. It's me, Krzysztof, your younger buddy! That's a good one! -And that smile! -True! -Wait... -Mom! -Marta Ostrowicz, what are you-- -Hello. Hello. I'll tell your mom-- First and foremost, hello... Rozalin! You're on first. Excuse me. One of the most distinguished jazz singers in the world: Urszula Dudziak! Also, the girl you love. Her social media is followed by half a million people: Ewa "Eva" Dykty! And last but not least, the man behind "Dark Night," head of the jury, graduate of your school... Let's welcome the jerk, pig and clown... -Got this? -You bet. You're an idiot, a moron, a jerk, a dimwit! Get her out of here! You're a washout! -Let go of me! -Didn't expect that from a local! -Nothing! -Hashtag jerk. Hashtag pigandmoron. Hashtag crazyrozalinchick... There will be consequences. She'll fail. She will! -Way to go! Great stuff! Did you get it? -You bet. The principal called. A staff meeting was called to discuss your case. You're an idiot, a moron, a jerk, a dimwit! SHE'S AN IDIOT HA HA STUPID COW You're a washout! UGLY TOO SHAME HER PARENTS FUCKED UP OMG SHE'S SO UGLY ANOREXIC SO FUCKED-UP -Ostra, you're a washout. -Pathetic. I knew she was an embarrassment. You suck so bad your pics are liked only by your mom, grandma and this fool. My mom should expel you. And your mother. Even your old man ran from you. Or maybe you're a test tube kid? -Psycho! -Let me go! Yelling at people, beating idiots? What's going on? -Beat it! -What? Ostrowicz! Where are you off to? I'll tell your mom! What's going on? OLO IS MY FATHER Why haven't you told me? You never asked. -And you... -Did nothing. -But he knew you were you. -He pretended he didn't recognize Mom. Everyone has forgotten about him, and then he shows up, -ruins my life and kills my mother! -Oh, come on. He treated her like shit. Stepped on her and went on his way. -Wow... -If he was still creative, at least... but he just soaks people in water. How pathetic. Look at his wheels! He got a mil just for being in the show. When he dies, you'll get all the royalties. -I don't want his money! -What, then? I'd squash him with a steamroller to see his guts! You could afford one. -Hello? -I'm calling from the TV show with great news. You have passed to the next stage of Music Race! I'm calling to invite you to a live show, which-- Hello? -Hello? -What did she say? -Moo. -Moo? -It was the Music Race. -What? Why? -They want me on the live show. -The live show? For months we've been looking for bold daredevils, but... Personality, charisma and guts are not everything. You have to be a singer too. -But we don't need a... -A jerk, pig and clown... Or hotheads, idiots, emotionally unstable teenagers. -You're a washout. -You're a washout! 2.5 million views in less than two hours. -Why am I not in it? -You are, later. Why so many? Simple. The wacko from Rozalin. -You set it all up, admit it. -Of course not. But I wish I had. Mela, who's on the show? Franek, Zośka, Mrs. Krystyna, what's her name... Me. Boring! Thanks, Andrzej. No, not "Thanks, Andrzej"! -Singing is not going to get us ratings. -But it's a singing show. Come on, my ass it is! I want that Rozalin wacko live! -I don't believe this. -Believe it! I want a scandal, a fight! "Boring" gets us off the air after the first season. Do you want that? -No. -Right. No further questions. But she didn't even sing. Listen, let's take... Amelia. Charisma: one, guts: one, singing: ten. Rozalin Wacko: charisma: 10, guts: 10, singing: zero, but as I see it, she's a total fame whore. -And that's your idea for the show? -Why not? -Congrats. -If she's such a fame whore, maybe she'll sing something? -And she'll suck at it. It'd be awesome! -It would. Excuse me, but the Rozalin wacko is here. Should I get rid of her? What did I tell you? Total fame whore. I want this gone. I'm helpless in this situation, miss. You signed an agreement when you auditioned. Besides, Olo doesn't waste such opportunities. -Olo? -Right. It was his idea. You threw water in his face and he's holding a grudge. Everyone is afraid of him here. Except for me, of course. So, I could try... talking to him. You know... I'd like to offer you a deal. A chance for revenge. On the show, live. Unedited. You'd tell him whatever you want. With millions of people watching. Roast him. Roast her, your style. What'd you give her? What will she do? You don't even have to sing "Dark Night." Just destroy her, please. It's going to be a big catch. Maybe we shouldn't have sent her alone. Not alone, with Antek. -We could've-- -She wouldn't have listened. -Hi, Małgosia. -Hey. Sorry for the intrusion... I wanted to talk, but not at school, -and not at home I guess... -You know... we're having... a family powwow, so... -You get it? -Sure. -Okay. -Maybe tomorrow... -What? Our coach? -Stop it. There we go. -No, I can't do it. -Stop it! Relax, it'll be great. What do they think about your talent? Urszula? It wasn't good. You're on. Stand on the marked spot and start singing. But I don't sing. I've got one thing to say to you: you're a washout. -I can't. -What? -I'll look like a fame whore. -Tell them how he ruined your life. He deserves the hate, not you. Listen... sometimes you need to take a risk or else you'll always regret that you didn't do something. -Go now! -I'm with you. Jesus, it's her! You're an idiot, a moron, a jerk... Ostra lives in Rozalin, Olo's hometown. Her first performance failed to charm the jury, but she got a second chance. Let's see how she fares this time. Very attached to your look, I see. I wonder what you'll wear next time. If you pass, that is. Can I help you somehow? Water, perhaps? Can you talk? Sing? Or just insult people? Harder, harder... I guess she forgot how to do that too. Maybe... You matter More than you realize Maybe... I want you more Than anyone has ever wanted you Maybe You are Someone easier to be Maybe You are a deafening silence That engulfs me When I ask which way to go That's exactly how This anxiety tastes And this fear And when the day is done You will calmly Give your answer That what I've got Is not enough for you What I've got I could hide no more Finally. Finally! I believed in it like crazy And what I've got Was to be a world for you What I've got Is not enough for you What I've got I could hide no more What I've got I believed in it like crazy And what I've got Was to be a world for you Clever girl! Is she your girlfriend? I don't know. I mean... I had no idea she was a singer. Let's see what the jury says. Urszula? I know you can yell. I don't know if you can talk. But your singing is spectacular! It's a "yes!" -Good job! -Great, Mother! Good for you. Ewa? -Wow! -Hashtag what? Hashtag shock. Awesome! -Olo, now you. -Give me Olo. -Olo? -They're talking to you. Keep the close-up, there'll be a reaction. Olo? You've got two votes, so you're staying. Although I wasn't impressed. Nevertheless, Ostra stays on the show! The next contestant... No... that was lame! "Not impressed." -Let's welcome another fame-hungry... -Drink. -Amelia! -All right. She is from Wroclaw, and she has sung before... -How is it that you can sing? -I don't know, I just do. But like that? What else don't I know? Meryl Streep's your real mother? Stop! Where are you going? -Home? -Sponsors' party. You have to be there. We have to. -We have to catch the last bus. -Do we? You don't understand what just happened. You're now under my wing. I'll take care of your whole career. And I'll start by introducing you to some big names. All food and accommodations are on me. Full exclusive. -Awesome. -Ciao. -No way. -Ostra! It's my first time in Warsaw. The only trips I take involve sleeping in a tent. I can't even afford fries, and I'm not going without you. Please! I want to see the world! Okay. I'll let Mom know. I hate this place. Marta Ostrowicz. I'm Franek. -Hi. You're also from-- -The Music Race, right. You're phenomenal. I mean, your voice is. It's not like I'm... -Where's your friend? -I don't know, I'm looking for her. Damn. You haven't seen me here. -Franek. -Right. You did well, Franek. Have you seen that girl from Rozalin around? -No, I'm sorry. -Are you sure? I'm sure. Why did you run away? Wow, what a view! Amazing! All this is... amazing. The way you sang... I really liked it. I like everything you do and... and... you. Good night. There she is! -Welcome! -Bye! The prettiest! Most talented! -Way to go! -I'll be going. Bye, Antek! Thanks a lot! There! I thought my heart would burst when they all got up, and then I almost laughed, because he was so shocked! -His face was so... -What? Dumbstruck! And when they all stood up, I was so overwhelmed... I had a lump in my throat. Girls, get in! Hurry! Hi! I need to go! -How's everything? -All right. But listen, no one told the audience to stand up? -No, they just really liked it! -No! -You're going to win that show! -You're going back there? No... come on. Why would I? You're the best, you could win. Your singing is divine. You said yourself: they loved it. What's not to like there? Him. Acting like he didn't know Mom. He doesn't exist to me. He got wasted every day for over a decade. His brain is like brushwood by now. -Mom! -Grandma! Maybe he really didn't recognize you. You went about it all wrong. Guys need it laid out simple. I see it like this: you two go there-- -Grandma... -You don't have to sing. But give him one last chance. You need to talk. Alone. And you're wearing this. Twentieth floor. Goodbye. Olo? Can you sign this? Can I have an autograph? Please! -He recognized you. -I'm sure he did. Because he was looking. -At the dress. -And you. At you. -I brought an extra set. -Thank you. Yes? I checked your room number. Uh-huh? Hi. -Hi. -May I? Sure. How could I not recognize you? I'm sorry. I've changed. Your eyes are the same. -But the rest is different. -No... it's about how I remember it. You know how I've been. And you? -You want a summary of the last 18 years? -If you don't mind.≈ Itemize them, I don't know. When you disappeared... I had Marta. -Olo... -Okay, I know. How much? -Excuse me? -I'll pay, but I want her gone from the show. You too. Get out. Relax, there's nothing to be ashamed of. -Just say the number, no problem. -I said get out! What an asshole. A jerk, a pig and a moron! I'm sorry. We won't be bothered by him. All right. Let's go home. -Why not? -That's what he wants. -I'll stay and win, to spite him! -But-- I left my phone downstairs. Crying? You ought to be happy. You're nailing it! People went nuts after your performance. Hey. Hey. Losing the finals to you would be an honor. I'll tell you what I think Straight to your face When I see you I feel ashamed That you still walk this earth So be aware that now I know I know every answer Say something I've got a razor-sharp answer You won't get away this time You're holding up your guard Making a million stupid faces Wait, just you wait I'm going to get you You keep repeating this It's everything I do I'm sick of you Those empty eyes I'm going to smash this mirror That's right The face in the mirror is mine That's right, it's mine! That's right The face in the mirror is mine That's right, it's mine -Great! -The face in the mirror is mine That's right, it's mine That's right The face in the mirror is mine That's right, it's mine That's right That's right That's right That's right That's right That's right OSTRA WE LOVE YOU Ostra, we love you! Loving Ostra is not unique. Judging by posts on social media, everyone loves Ostra! Everyone! That's right! I wonder if our judges love her as well. Ewa? If I'm to be frank... It's pointless. Washout. What? What? Olo? Olo, she's staying, get it? Olo! She's staying! First I'd like to thank the costume department. Great look. Congrats, really. What's this crap? Ewa, what do you think? No, I didn't like the performance or the look. She stole your jacket. You'd look okay in it, but her? -It's beautiful! -She looks great. Let's get back to the song. You can sing, we can hear that. You've got the looks. But it's all so... pushy. You're imposing yourself. Is he nuts? Maybe people buy it, but I don't. -I don't agree! -This is not charisma. -You're fired! -Fire him! -Urszula. -This is baloney! I can't believe my ears! You have know nothing about good vocals! How could you? I'm going to take those buttons from you! Go on! You, talking about charisma? You'd have to have it to talk about it. She has it! She does! And they say you can sing. -Not that song. -Just that one? You are spectacular! You are staying! Lifeline! Good job! Ostra is staying on the show! Ostra's great performance is behind us. We'll find out what's next after a break. YOU WERE GREAT! REALLY? CHECK IT OUT! Ostra! Relaxed after the show? -Even more so. -You have to be at your best. And why is that? You've got competition on the show. -She is so insolent. -You like her. No! Okay, what's this about? You. She's got the best voice this season, we both know it. She's great, charismatic, brave. People will love her, they'll call her a revelation, new star... You know how it goes. I'm sorry for telling you this, but... I care about you. We need to get rid of her. The sooner the better. Marta! Marta, wait! -Congrats, you were great! -You're really hot. -Why is Olo harassing you like that? -Is Dykta really so awesome? -Dykty! -Dykty. -You're a great singer, we didn't know-- -You're so talented. -Hi. -My family will vote for you. Everyone. -Marta! -And me. Here. Hi. I wanted to... apologize. Ostra, wait. BEST BEST BEST SHOCK AND AWE MY APOLOGIES OLO CAN WASH YOUR FEET FANTASTIC YOU'RE DIVINE Go on, tell me. It was... weird. -Weird? -The faculty lost their minds. All they talk about is you. And your conduct grade is back to normal. They all wanted a pic with her. Because they all suddenly like me. Because you're great! They were blind to it before. Now you showed them you've got talent and you're the best. -No! -What is it? Pour me some Chablis. -At 10:00 a.m.? -Come on! "Asked why she refuses interviews by pop magazines, Ostra replied... she didn't want to end up like Olo." She spoke just one sentence! She is the talk of the town! And only getting good press! She hasn't even come up with one hashtag. Hashtag motherfucker. WHY IS OLO BENT ON DESTROYING OSTRA? There will be no more lifelines! Let's hear from the head of the jury. Come on... I don't know what to do with you. -You've got a problem with me, huh? -I have... a feeling you're not making progress. The young grandpa said. Olo... And what would you know about progress? You've done nothing but regress. Cheeky. I think it's evaluation time. Let's start with the queen of likes. Yes or no? Listen... you're so focused on notes... -Hate's coming. -She's mincing her words, it's going to get ugly. No emotions, whatsoever. Hashtag not this time. What about the empress of jazz? Our granny. Again? Are you brain-dead? She's great! Yes, yes, yes! You know the rules, Olo. Ostra's fate is in your hands. -Olo, seriously... -Seriously... Ostra! Ostra! Ostra! Now what? Stay on him. I don't like your cockiness. And I don't like your last song. "Dark Night"? Really? What's next? "Bright Day"? Good one. Olo, she stays. I used to be like that. And I wasn't ready for fame. Or any of this. Press the fucking button! And you're not either. But maybe you need to see for yourself. Hashtag Ostra stays on the show! Got a light? It's a no smoking zone. Sorry. Fucking asshole. You smoke? Treacherous pig! One boo in the audience and you screw our deal? She was supposed to be out! You're pathetic! Małgosia! Wait! Wait. -You're... -A dick? Feel free. I had 18 years to accept the fact you cut me out. That you left me pregnant. You never showed up or anything, ever. But I won't let you hurt my child. She deserves a better father. -Wait. -Let me go. What are you doing? It's showtime. Now. Everyone's waiting for you, you're sitting next to Olo. Finally, we're all here, so we can move on to the press conference. Thanks. Any questions? Not everyone at once. The gentleman in the green jacket. Olo, Ostra, everyone is electrified by your relationship. Is there a chance for a glimmer of sunshine between you two? -You know-- -It's-- It's like in Olo's song: "It's dark now, so who cares?" -We'll see what tomorrow brings. -Thank you. -Authorization? -With my manager. Come pose for pics. -You're not talking to me. -It doesn't show in a pic. Ewa! Coming or not? In a moment everyone will forget about us. Good. I'll have some peace. Excuse me. They took, like, three pictures of me. And, like, 300 of them! You're fucking annoying! -Could I get an interview? -Not now. Mom, what are you doing here? What's going on? I screwed up. Please, who hasn't? -I also went through a crisis. -Yeah? Sure. Though it's hard to believe. No one wanted to buy this idea and I had to... sacrifice a lot to get the Race on air, to get people on board. Then I meet you, the old-timer, Ewa the fame whore, and Papaya... and suddenly my life makes sense. Yours will make sense too. You just need to find... you know. How old are you? Forty. -A kid. -What? You have to have a baby. A child would become more important for you, like Race was to me. It'll be... an imperfect, somewhat naughty kid, but you'll love it all your life. -Boss! -Yeah? A phone call! Urgent! You don't need to yell! That was Franek on Music Race! -Thank you! -Franek. And now, a song the younger audience probably doesn't know, so we were surprised that a young girl put up a real fight to sing it! -Good luck. -Ostra! Hello! The negotiations went on for a week, but I convinced them, because it's my birthday today! I'll sing a song which is as old as I am. It's 18. That's right, Olo, it's your song! With a special dedication to you! You're a moron Making that dumb face Getting nothing Non-operating brain Burned out by coke You're a moron Making that dumb face Getting nothing Unable to love, unable to love Unable to love, unable to love Unable to love, unable to love Unable to love And he's got a broomstick up his ass. Moments fly You're just getting by You don't realize It's vegging, not a life Constantly on pills Moments fly You're just getting by You don't realize Unable to love, unable to love Unable to love, unable to love Unable to love, unable to love Unable to love Thank you! Ostra! Ostra! Ostra! Ostra! Ostra! Your parents won't be happy you chose such intense lyrics. My mom is proud of me. And my father is estranged, so I couldn't care less. -I'm sure he regrets it now. -I doubt it. Let's not forget it's Ostra's birthday! Happy birthday to you One more time Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you! Nice, but it's time for the verdict, hopefully also nice for Ostra. It hurt. Good. I'm still mad, that's right. But... I kind of get you, you know? That's who you are, right? A sucker for the audience. Okay. And don't worry about the brat. She's just a brat. You ought to be sorry for her. Having a dick for a father, no wonder she grew up to be so cocky. Hey... I forgive you. If you had voted the brat out first... and it was my turn... and they were booing... then I'd also... Yep. Hashtag sincerity. Hashtag we're alike. Could you move? Thank you. The usual. Congrats on the performance. That was... intense. And good. Listen... You need to know that... I'd like to tell you-- Could you stop looking at the phone when I'm talking to you? Do you know what's on it? 30,000 followers, each one more important than you. Wonderful. You think it's so important? -You're drinking? -You're not my father! Ready to go? What's up, Olo. -We're not staying at the party? -No, I've got a surprise. Come on. Bye! What is this? I rented it. It's a special occasion. -You think she'll come? -Sure. -But it's-- -She'll come. She will. Get the champagne! Surprise! Do I know you? So... we drank a toast to Mommy... now a toast to Daddy! Hush! Wait... Quiet! Hold it... What are you doing here? Surprise. I didn't know. It's cool. I get it. -You've got... a different life now. -What do you want? Nothing now. Great. Firm. Good. Great legs. Over here, at me. Firm expression. Sideways. -I don't know... -It's our 15 minutes of fame. A firm pose, great. Firm legs. Grab her harder. Very good. No smiles. Thar's right, great. Ostra, face up. More intensity. Great pose. New card. -What would you compare your love to? -Excuse me? -What would you compare your love to? -We are one. They are one. What is this shit? Golden shit! Couples are a commodity. We're going to do the same, or else they'll dethrone us! Check the number of their followers! Motherfucker! They are one... I'll answer it! -Who was it? -No one. -Hi, Olek. -Hello. You look old. -A drink? -What do you want? I'll see if I've got ice. -I'd like to warn you-- -Apologize? Warn me? Against what? Have you seen this? This shoot, this interview-- it's too early. Too soon. -Even if it's too early, it's too late... -It can be undone. ...for your parenting advice. That can't be undone. -This jerk is using her! -Now you're her father? We don't want anything from you. Least of all, your advice. In case you decide I was right. I'm sorry. For everything. Marta! Ostra! It went to her head. I think Pati's going out with Antek now. -I don't care. -Good. The next episode's in a week. Meanwhile, you'll be catching up on schoolwork. -I've got no time! -That's a good one! Marta. Marta! -This is a bit too much. -I've got to seize this opportunity! Hey! Hey! Marta! What is this? I came to catch a breath, and all I get is Antek, Pati... What do I care? I've got a different life, I won't stay in this dump! -What about school? -Write me a slip! That was the semi-finals song by Ostra and Franek! You two are great! You've got voice, you've got charisma, you've got sex appeal. You give me chills when I listen to you. Ewa, do you agree? I do, finally we're on the same page... about Franek. Marta, I think... and I think you feel it too... that it was a bit forced. You're not Beyoncé. -She's not. -So what? Nothing! It's great you're not pretending to be someone else. You're yourself! You're Marta Ostrowicz! Keep it like that! Olo, your turn. You want my honest opinion? As always. That was cheap. Like that look which doesn't suit you. You're pandering to primitive tastes. And do you know why they liked it? -Because we're on TV. -We are. Where it pays to be cheap. And to pretend to be someone else. But you don't need that. Trust me, I know. I'm telling you this, because... I wish you well. Because you're talented. -My, my... -What's going on here? Thanks for your opinions, judges. The decision as to who will make it to the finals is up to you, our viewers. We'll learn your verdict after a short break. We'll take ten! What was that senile speech supposed to mean? How could you do this to me? You've sent us into media oblivion! Do I look like a retiree? Because that's how you've made me feel! Like a stupid old hag, who just doesn't get it! -Or maybe you're hot for that brat? -Chill. That's how you act! Admit it! You're hot for her! You could be her father! I am her father. -Did you cast Hot and Singing already? -No. -You'll cast me. -Well... I'll give you something that will make you very happy. Honey... a few years ago I might have been tempted, but now... Information! -And what will be in it for me? -You'll double your ratings. Hashtag it's fishing time. Once again, a round of applause for the first finalist, Mr. Władek! -Bravo! -Success. Do the viewers want to see Franek in the grand finale? Yes! The shorter Freddie Mercury. Here's the viewers' verdict. Yes! Congratulations! Ladies and gentlemen, we have only one spot left in the finals, and two semi-finalists: -Marta and Amelia. -Marta. Marta, come over. Ostra! Ostra! Ostra! -Will we see Marta in the grand finale? -Audience. Watch it. Change of script. -You'll get an envelope, read the note! -Three, be alert. Read it. Excuse me for a moment. I've just received news that this envelope doesn't contain a verdict. This envelope contains shocking information I must verify right now. According to this... one of the semi-finalists is closely related... with our judge. -Show the judges. -Shock! Olo... is this true? If Olo confirms this, someone will have to leave the show this minute. Those are the rules. Olo, we're waiting. All right, I'll just ask you. Are you... the father of... Marta Ostrowicz? Two, close-up on Marta. Olo? Olo, we're waiting. No one should have a father like me. But are you her father or not? -Olo, you have to tell the truth. -Olo? Her lousy father? I am. Finally. How moving! I'm very proud of Marta. According to the rules no participant can be related to people working on the show. And so, the finalists are... Amelia... -Franek... -Marta! Marta! -I'm sorry. -For what? For fucking up my life for the second time? -I had no idea they'd use it. -Marta! Honey... don't worry. This place is not for us. -We're going home. -I'm not going back to that shithole! -Marta! -What? I'm not going to live like you. A sad, lonely teacher in Rozalin! -Leave me alone, all of you! -Marta! -Awesome, dears, we're wrapping it up. -We've got it. Fuck you. Man, you can have 50 daughters all over the country, it's a gold mine. Screw you... and your show. You'll quit and pay a mil in fines? I doubt it. You shouldn't have signed the contract. It's Marta. I guess I'm busy, catch me later. GO BACK TO YOUR DUMP! IMPOSTOR DUMB CHICK! THOUGHT NO ONE WOULD KNOW? YOU FAILED ME NEPOTISM! LIAR HA HA HA LITTLE LIAR ROZALIN'S HOTTEST DADDY PAID -Now what? -You dropped out. And... the album? -You said I was in your agency. -Maybe next year. You need a rebranding. Because you've made a mess. Yes! You had your father on the jury. People are calling you an impostor. "Daddy got her on the show." That's what they're saying. That's why, for now, I see no place for you in show business. Believe me. SHE'S DISGUSTING I ALWAYS SAID SHE WAS A DOG SCREWED HER WAY UP FUCK ME, SO PATHETIC! Finally! Do you know what that asshole told me? That I'm an impostor? -Let's leave this place, please-- -Ostra! It's over for you, but I have a shot at winning. You had your shot. I tried to help you. Now you help me. Go back to Rozalin, lay low and... don't call me. You're toxic. Hello? Hi, how have you been? Hi. What is it? I'm busy. Oh... it's nothing, bye. Welcome to the grand finale of a one-of-a-kind show. There will be no mercy. We'll see which finalist will be showered with compliments, and which one with actual cold water. We'll see who'll prove to be waterproof and win the finale of the Music Race. And then to which camera? Let's check it. Here? One to the right? I'm fixing this spot. Olo... If we're all set, then ask the rest of the audience in and let's begin. Okay? I'll be waiting in my dressing room. Thank you. She's texting how she's all alone, suffering, deserted. -Fuck! -She's your girl. Ostra is not my girl! Screw her! No, no... she won't drag me down. She doesn't know her away around this world. She's too lame for that. Provincial cunt. Olo... -What's going on? -He bloke my tooth! -He broke my tooth! -Let me see. Show me your face. Are you crazy? Fuck! Where will I get him a tooth now? -Hold it! -I've got more important things. What's more important than the finals? My daughter. Get up. Olo! -Looking for Marta? -She won't take my calls. She's not at the hotel, I don't know where to look. I've got an idea. Come on. Fuck! Come. You're kidding. Get in. Come on. Okay? -Hold this. -What are you doing? What are you doing? Take it, before I change my mind. This wasn't the best idea. Best one I ever had. I'll check the toilets. Let's go! What's he doing here? -We were worried about you. -You're on his side now? -Wait! Let's talk! -We've got nothing to talk about! -Marta, wait. I'm sorry. -Sorry? -You expect I'll forgive you now? -Don't forgive me. But listen to me. -Wait... -Leave me alone! Please, let me say something. I made a mistake back then. But I couldn't miss my chance. The thought of staying in Rozalin, having a family, nice and cozy... I regret it. I regret I didn't try to work it out with your mom somehow. Now I know what I want. To have a daughter. One like you. I don't believe you! Marta! Marta! Dad... I finally passed math. By some miracle, because that witch hates me. Likewise. Now it's just chemistry... Easy-peasy. Back then, outside the club... I lied saying I didn't believe you. Don't screw this up, Dad. Oh, and I've got a surprise for you. I wrote it for you a long time ago. So don't laugh. You're not there No, you're not there When I'm screaming You're not there No, you're not there When I'm whispering I need your advice I need to hear your voice I need to ask you something And like God, you are not answering I need your advice I need to hear your voice I need to ask you something And like God, you are not answering Marta, wait! I'm sorry about your father. I know. Thanks. Will we talk again? Sure. When all of this is over. That was something, dear Olo. Pity you've missed it. I must've watched it three times by now. Maybe you'll see it someday. Doctor. Doctor! Doctor! I made up with Antek. I think we'll be together. True, he went out with Pati... but I went out with Franek. and you had Ewa, and Mom has forgiven you. We need to forgive. Although Pati is worse than Ewa. A total bimbo. And Antek... he's so honest and real. I think I love him. Lie down, please. Easy... Olo dear, easy... Lie down, please. What's your name? My girl! Welcome to the next episode of Ewa: Hot and Singing. This was supposed to be pink! Nothing is ready, the check didn't come... Ewa, not now, please. Payday will come, now we need to get this on tape, so please, focus. Now, when I want my teeth nicely exposed, I use American Dream toothpaste. Which also gets rid of bad breath. -Good morning, ma'am! -Morning! -Good morning! -I already said "good morning." -You run too? -You asked me that yesterday. Did I? And what did you answer? That you asked the day before. Welcome to the next episode of Ewa: Hot and Singing. Today it's Bavarian cheese and dumplings... Mrs. Dykta, a half step lower. Dykty! The name's Dykty, how many times do I need to tell you, idiot? I'm not a Dictaphone! Make me some lemon balm tea. Are you kidding? You make me some. Subtitle translation by Michał Kwiatkowski Thanks. Mom... it's time we talked about my father. Ever heard of the band Budka Suflera?
