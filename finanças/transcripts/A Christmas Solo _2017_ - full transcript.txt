-[grand orchestral music] -[projector clicking] [upbeat seasons music] [upbeat seasons music] [main title music] This isn't working! Uh! You ridiculous creature! The universe is trying to tell you that thing is embarrassing. Really? I thought it was telling you to help me. Dad's wreath is on the door. -I'm done. -No, uh-uh. No, no, come here. We have work to do. Are you trying to get in good with the neighbors by being as tacky as they are? Come on, after years of being in San Francisco with no yard, I just want reindeer. I want lots and lots of reindeer. I'm not the kind of help you need. Come help me, please. I participate under protest. Okay, here, here. If you do that here, like that, a-ha! Okay, okay! -Mom! -So exciting! Drum roll, please! [humming] [humming] Okay, okay this'll be great. [exhales] Okay. [electricity crackling] [light jingle] What was that, Universe? [light orchestral music] It's so not fair! I know it's tough. Your mom was excited about the trip too, but something came up. -What's his name? -It was work. And I'm sure she'll take you to New York some other time. Yeah, but not at Christmas time. The only time it's worth being there. Look, I'll make sure you have fun here, okay? With your cousins. And you got to see what me and Uncle Pete have going for the Christmas concert, it's going to be awesome. How could she do this to me? And how could you let her leave in the first place? Honey. [sighing] [cash register clicking] [Lisa] Thanks, Nate. Merry Christmas. You too, Lisa. Thank you. Hi. Merry Christmas. -Hi. -[Lisa] Have a good afternoon. -Oh, I'm sorry. -It's all right. Sorry, I didn't mean to do that. I'm in a bit of a rush. -It is the season. -Yeah. [chuckling] Um, so I bought this reindeer here and I need to exchange it. Oh, did you want something else? I want another reindeer, but one that lights up. This one doesn't. And I couldn't fit it back in the box, so, yeah. Oh, I am sorry. Um... Except, I just sold my last two. -You're kidding me? -Sorry. Figures. I mean, it's fine. -It's fine. -You say it won't light? -Yeah. -Did you check the fuse? -It's in the... The hoof. -The hoof? Yeah, I checked the fuses, both fuses in both hooves. Well, maybe Walter's got some over at the nursery. He's not carrying them this year. Oh, um well, thanks for the thought. -Wait, wait! How committed to reindeer are you? -On a scale of one to ten? Yeah, like a one being, like, it's a passing thought, and a ten is like, you know, the true Christmas spirit is reindeer on my lawn. -[laughing] -[coughs] You'd be surprised how crucial LED animals are to my family having a perfect Christmas. Well, how about on a scale of, I'll pay you more than you paid her? You're going to scalp my reindeer in front of me? Maybe we should take this outside. Unless you're a lawyer or a cop? Oh no, she's the new veterinarian. He's an excellent cabinetmaker. Nate, Jennifer. Jennifer, this is Nate. Hi. Hi, Nate. Um, this is the first Christmas in Brookfield for my daughter and me. And it's actually our first Christmas with a lawn. And, you know, my daughter is just so excited about having, you know, a full display... -Jennifer. -...out front. We've had kind of a crushing year and the only thing that's been giving me hope is the fact that my daughter really wants to decorate. She's the reason I'm out here trying to buy all of the reindeer even though Lisa only had two. So, I'm really sorry, um, this is our first one on our own. Yeah, she'll be so disappointed. I'm sorry. You know what? I'm really sorry, I completely overstepped, I apologize. No, you were trying to do right by your daughter and I respect that. Yeah, and I respect what you're doing. Yeah, Merry Christmas. Um, should I just leave this guy here? Oh yeah, just leave it there I'll take care of it. -I'll just get your credit card. -Um, okay. -What do you say to one? -What? -No mark up. -Um. I can't do that, I can't. I mean, your daughter is already settling for less than she wanted. Yeah, but you're not going to have anything on your brand new lawn. Well, I'll figure something out. You sure you checked the fuse? I'd be happy to take a look. He's very handy. Um, no, that's okay. Merry Christmas. One's better than nothing. -Oh yeah, but the guilt. So... -[laughs] -Yeah, thank you. [laughs] -Okay. Merry Christmas, Nate. Leave that there, it's fine. Okay...

Um... Yeah, I'll be right over then. Don't keep the queen waiting. It's not like that, it's just, I actually do have to go though. So, um... We will be talking about music and stuff. [laughs] MJ? Yeah, she's part of the chorus with Henry and I. Like you should be. I don't think I've met her yet. Lucky you. I mean she's a good singer and he helps her write some songs, but she used to be kind of sweet and now she's a total ice-cold diva. So, are her and Henry a thing? Ew, no! No, they just collab. He's way too smart for that. [chuckling] [strumming] [humming] Whoa, cookies! What's that? Oh, this actually is a song I've been working on for my YouTube channel. I was really excited.

That was okay. -[laughing] -[Charlotte] That's not even funny. Who is that with Audrey? Henry? [scoffing] No, it's Charlotte. She's in my math class. Her mom's the new vet. -[camera shutter clicking] -My dad took Sadie in for shots and says her mom seems nice. Well, Henry better be careful, or he'll catch fleas. [door opens] [laughing] Danielle? What's wrong? Thank you all for your patience. Danielle and I needed some time. We've had some difficult news. -Danielle has vocal nodes. -[gasping] She's on complete vocal rest for the next six weeks. And I know, even without me having to ask, that she has your full support. We want her to be in full and complete voice for Juilliard. [sobbing] So who's going to sing the solo at the Christmas Festival? We're going to have auditions. [all murmuring] This is incredible. I doubt that Danielle thinks so. I know, that's terrible. But it means Charlotte can audition. -What? No. -Come on! I can't, I don't even have an accompanist. -Oh, I'll accompany you. -Perfect! It'll be great, come on, I'll do it! Charlotte, you have to audition. -Oh my God, you have to. She's going to do it, it's decided. -[laughing] -[Audrey] Perfect! -She's gonna...

[light Christmas music] [drill whirring] [light Christmas music] Hope people don't think we're overdoing it.

Well why don't you take Melissa somewhere, you know, just the two of you? Somewhere sunny and expensive. It'll just look like I'm trying to show Vivian up. Just showing up shows up Vivian. Come on, Pete. Sorry, but you know that I'm right, little brother. Eh, no, the other way. No, no the other, other way. Yeah, here. -[grunts] -This level of expertise and focus? No wonder you need me around. [laughing] Well, I can bring in some help if you want to get away. I don't, I want to spend Christmas with you and Marcie and the kids. I want her to want that, too. [laughs] But you can't make her want it. I just got to help her move past this hurt. Oh yeah? How's your moving going? [upbeat Christmas music] Who's my favorite fat kitty? Mrs. Reilly's concerned that Cleopatra is not going to be eating while she's away. Oh, what does she feed her? Marc Antony's army? Oh, welcome to detox, your majesty. Oh, you're wonderful, but I can't let you work the entire holiday. You need to have some time off, enjoy your first Christmas in Brookfield. We'll manage to -have some downtime. -[bell ringing] -Hi. -Huh. I have a delivery for Dr. Flynn? Nate Prentiss? I see endangered species by appointment only. This guy's endangered? Well no, but... I know that this is not a reindeer. You had to come all the way to the vet to figure that out? Hey, Cristina. Hi, Nate, Merry Christmas. So, if you're Santa's helper, where's my BMW? Sorry, just the one delivery today. I called everybody I could think of and nobody had a reindeer. This is the man who stole your reindeer? I didn't steal it! Well, I believe I used the term, you know, just grabbed it before I did. Yeah and I felt really badly about that. I kept thinking about your daughter and the fact that she wanted a reindeer. So, you brought me a penguin? Yeah. -I wanted to be a good neighbor. -[laughing] And if you don't accept this awkward gesture, this penguin is going to be homeless for the holidays. Well, I don't want that to happen, so um but I can't accept it. I made sure it worked before I bought it and everything. Well that's very thoughtful of you, but I would be taking it under false pretenses because, um... My daughter didn't want the reindeer. I did. [chuckling] Well, that's going to make me feel even worse. No, you shouldn't feel bad at all. This is probably like the most bizarre, yet heartfelt gift that I think I've ever received from a relative stranger. Got to find out what came in second. When we know each other better. Okay, so you'll accept Percival? Penelope. You're the vet. [laughs] Merry Christmas, Jennifer. -Welcome to Brookfield. -Thanks, Nate. Bye, Nate! -See you. -Don't be a stranger! [door bell ringing] So? Twenty-five words or less. His wife left him, cheated on him, ripped his heart out, left him with an angry teenage daughter and a mountain of debt. But, most eligible bachelor in town. That's 25! Thanks, but no. Time to concentrate on men who actually need me. So, Mr. Wiggles? -[dog growling] -Here he is. Thank you, hi honey. I got you. Okay, I'll be right back. Come on. [upbeat rock music] [upbeat rock music] [Melissa] Is that vet girl? Yeah, Charlotte Flynn. If she sings, how come she's not in chorus? Maybe she's getting Henry to coach her privately. Very privately. -Says who? -Jeez, I'm just being funny, Melissa. You want funny? "Girl, fleas." Send that to me. Me too. Snapped it to all of you. Don't worry, you've got this, Melissa. Henry, I changed our rehearsal schedule so you can help me with my audition for the Christmas solo. Ah, that's really generous of you MJ, but I'm actually kind of working with somebody else this time. But you're always my accompanist. Um, this time, I'm working with Charlotte. -That new girl? -Yeah. Did you know she had to move here because she got in huge trouble at her old school? No, she actually moved here because her dad died. Not what I heard. -Okay, stop! -Stop what? Whatever it is that you're doing. Just leave her alone. [light orchestral music] You sure this is okay? The perks of stage managing the last three shows. [sighs] Best acoustics in town. [sighing] You need to stop worrying. Stop thinking so much. Just sing. Come here, close your eyes. I mean it! Close your eyes. -[scoffs] -Just you and the song. That's it. Like the man said, "Lose yourself." [laughing] We can even just do something simple like, [piano chord] ♪ Jingle bells, jingle bells No, no, no, no. Actually... Do you know "Silent Night"? Yes. Yeah, you do.

As long as you don't have another penguin, I will stay calm. [laughs] No, I'm out of the penguin business. [chuckling] I was just buying Christmas tree lights, which I could've sworn I bought last year. Well then, it's nice to see you again. -Maybe one more penguin comment? -Ach. You were doing so well there for a minute. The wheels have sort of come off my holidays, so I might have been overcompensating a tiny bit trying to make sure that everybody had everything they needed for theirs. Well, I'm sorry about your Christmas. Just trying to make it right for my daughter, not really batting a thousand. You know the first one alone is hard. Well, Cristina told me that you're newly divorced. Yeah. Thanks. My daughter is a teenager, too. And, well, my husband died two years ago. Oh I'm sorry, I didn't know. Yeah, thank you. Um... I get the whole perfect Christmas thing. Our first one was, you know, and this is the first one we've had since moving from San Francisco, so there's other challenges there, too. So... Well, then I'm very glad that I stopped. I was going to walk on by, but then I did notice you were maybe trying to make a decision here between the pies. Oh, was it that obvious? I mean... -Was I drooling? -No, no drooling. -[chuckling] -You were about to make a terrible mistake. Oh, so, wait a minute. So, with the pecan over the apple? No, you need to walk away from this place, and go to the Brown Sugar Bakery. No, but Cristina told me this was the best bakery in town. I've known Cristina since kindergarten and I love her, but this indicates a serious gap in her knowledge. Why should I trust you over her? Because I'm trying to impress you, and I have something to lose. There's more to me than penguins. Well, there's also pie. Yeah, all year round. [laughing] So, where is this Brown Sugar Bakery shop? -It's two blocks south. -Okay. Main and Seabrook. Okay, I think I can find that. Full disclosure, they do have an enormous selection, so you might want to order a slice, sit down, take a while to decide, maybe have a cup of coffee? Well, it seems like I might need a guide. I might know someone. Tomorrow night? Well, I don't know about you, but um... my teenager is probably really hungry. I got to get home and make her dinner. Yeah. Eight o'clock? I'll see you there.

And did it? For 15 minutes. [laughing] I get it. I'm wise in the ways of sulky teenage girls. -Really? -Mmmm. I'm going to have to hit you up for some tips.

Hi. Thanks for letting me drag you out here. See how I'm kicking and screaming? [chuckling] Thank you. I just needed some advice and I thought lurking outside the clinic all day waiting until you're done might be a little desperate. Yeah, it probably would've, but I'm happy to make house calls.

[chuckling] Since we've been getting to know each other, I've kind of made a point of not talking about my daughter. But I kind of got to talk about my daughter. Okay. You were the first person I thought of. Oh, because I have access to horse tranquilizers? I'm not sure they're going to be strong enough to calm her down. I mean for you. Am I that bad? You'll be okay. So tell me what's going on. [gentle music] Okay, so when her mother left, um, she didn't just leave. -She had an affair... -Aw. -...and then she left. -I'm so sorry. Yeah. So that's been a thing, obviously, and it's going to take her some time to work through that and I understand that, I totally get it. But in the meantime, there's literally nothing I can say that's not some sort of catastrophic insult or injury. You know, I thought 16 year old girls were tricky when I was 16! Well, I was a 16 year old girl once and I don't understand my daughter. [laughing] Well, so much for the advice. [both laughing] Oh, right. Um... No, I just try to... I just try to remember what it was like when I was her age. I remember what I was like when I was her age -every time a boy comes to the door. -Mmm. Yeah, I'm sure, I'm sure. I mean, I just... I just think about all the changes that are going on, for me, my friends, all the hormones! My parents moved me into a new high school junior year. I didn't know anybody, I just... My dad was in the army. I was in 16 different schools by the time I graduated. Seventeen, I think, with kindergarten. Wow, no wonder you're so good at making friends. Just not that experienced at keeping them. You seem to be doing pretty good so far with me. You must have been pretty smooth in high school. -No. -No? -Not really smooth. -Mmmm.

What was that about? Total embarrassment. So then you say excuse me, and you step back inside. You don't stomp and slam. What is this mood all about? Was she the Brown Sugar not-date? Because that sure looked like a post-date. How about this? How about for Christmas you give me the chance at having an adult relationship again. And in return, I'll give you whatever you want. I want Mom! I want Mom to want to spend Christmas with me. Can you give me that? Yeah, I didn't think so. [somber music] How did your audition go? Pretty good, actually. It's nice how supportive Audrey and Henry have been. Henry supported, Audrey demanded. [chuckling] They've been really good friends. Yeah. You know, I'm really proud of you for trying something new. More like returning to something old. In a new way. Even if I don't get the solo, I feel good about auditioning. So, do I get to be proud of you for going on a date? Oh, it wasn't... For going out for coffee with a new friend. Thank you. How do you feel about his audition? [chuckling] I think he's getting a callback. [both laughing] Give me one of those. [Jennifer] I'll share, I promise. [light acoustic guitar music] [Audrey] We believe in you. [laughing] -You so got it. -You two are the best. [light acoustic guitar music] [laughing] [door clicking] [teacher] Good afternoon, music lovers. I want to thank everyone who came to the auditions, especially those who were called back. I'm impressed with your performances, I'm impressed with your passion for the Christmas Festival. I'm thrilled that you're all invested in one of our town's oldest and finest traditions. The solo will be sung by Charlotte Flynn. [Henry] Hey. [cheering] I'm looking forward to working with you, Charlotte. Yes, ma'am. I mean, thank you. Congratulations. [all murmuring] Ms. Baxter? Yes, MJ? Can you please explain... You gave an excellent audition, MJ. Then what happened? Charlotte gave a better one. But I've been in chorus all these years. You know me, I've worked so hard and she just... Gave a better audition. MJ, I'm a fan. I'd be happy to sit down and talk with you. We can discuss techniques to work on for your next audition. This is going to be the worst Christmas ever. It shouldn't have to be, MJ. Come see me in the study hall tomorrow, we'll talk more. -[hard knocking] -[sighing] Let's celebrate! -Wait. -[laughing] -Hey no, you don't have to do this. -Yes, I do. -Gosh, Charlotte. -Charlotte, wait! -I just wanted to say... -You think you're so much better than me, don't you? -What? -You don't know the first thing about me. And you don't care about anyone but yourself. -Standing off on the sidelines, judging the rest of us. -MJ, stop! -Shut up, Henry. -You shut up, MJ. This was supposed to be special, Miss San Fran. Okay, this was important. And instead some stranger has to come in and ruin literally everything. You and your fleas can go infest some other town. [light acoustic guitar music] You must have been awesome. Congrats! [light acoustic guitar music] What the heck just happened? [light acoustic guitar music] ♪ I wait for you to come home ♪ But don't you know Honey, you're going to be late for school. Don't care, I'm not going. Come on, what hurts? Is this a I'm not ready for my history test bug? Or I still have 100 pages left of Tale of Two Citiesflu? Or I'm dodging the paparazzi before my amazing Christmas solo stomach ache? Honey, come on, tell me what's wrong. Probably just an adrenaline crash from the auditions and everything. It's stupid. It is not stupid, it's exciting. Come on. And for the record, I finished Tale of Two Cities. Congratulations! Two days early. Fantastic! In that case, it is a far, far better shower you take now than you have ever taken before. Oh, by the way, tell Charlotte I say congrats on the solo. -How'd you know? I hadn't even told you about the audition. -Oh I know, thanks a lot, boss. Well, I didn't want to brag. Are you kidding? You're required to brag. You could put signs on your front lawn and people would stop and cheer. This is a big deal. Well, I figured it was important with all the auditions. Yeah, and I bet you there's a lot of buzz at school about it, in fact, there's probably some noses out of joint. I remember my sophomore year, Didi Bartholemew barely got offstage before she threw up all over the place from nerves. Probably ate shepherd's pie, I could tell, but I was really close to the front. But it doesn't really matter because what people remember is she had a beautiful songbird voice. Although there are some people that do remember the barf. I don't think Charlotte will be that nervous. Well, I hope Charlotte won't be that nervous. She probably won't be that nervous, but... So, if Nate didn't explain that to you, then what did you talk about? [chuckles] Oooh, Santa's bringing someone a boyfriend for Christmas! [light orchestral music] -I want all the details! -Nope, you get nothing! Come on! What? So, how long have you known Henry? Since pre-school. You guys seem so great together. We are now. Fifth grade got a little ugly, but we worked it out. [laughing] Have you ever... Don't even. -Don't. -[laughing] What are you guys talking about? -Our favorite Christmas cookies. -Right! Chocolate chip snowballs. Ah, any luck finding your mom something? I found her the perfect slippers. -The ones she has are so old. -[Henry laughs] -Did you find what you were looking for? -Yeah, actually. [gasping] Oh my gosh, I am so sorry! Are you actually insane, MJ? I just don't know what happened. We just came to say hi to you guys and I guess I must have tripped. We'll go back to the store and we'll talk to them. I'm not usually a klutz. But you're always a liar! Excuse you? I'm sorry, Charlotte. Accidents happen, Eva. You ruined my mother's Christmas present and you think it's funny? I'm hurt you'd say that, Charlotte. I'm trying to help you. Better dry off, Charlotte. Don't want to catch a cold. True, you need to stay healthy for the Festival. I'll be fine. Sure hope so. Let's take you back to the store, and then we'll get you home, come on. [dramatic music] -[Nate] Close your eyes. -[Jennifer] Okay. [chuckles] Keep them closed. Keep them closed. One second. [door closing] [chuckling] Keep them closed. And voilà! [light orchestral music] Huh? Santa's throne! I mean, it's not finished, so there's going to be a window behind it and all of the toys are gonna be surrounding it. It's you know... -It's amazing. -Yeah? Uh-huh. Everyone's going to love it. -I hope you do. -I do. And I'm kind of fond of the guy who built it, too. [Pete screaming] -Seriously? -Seriously! [gasping] Hey, what'd you do? -Oh man, oh man, oh man. -What'd you do, how bad is it? No, don't show me, just tell me. -I don't know, I didn't look. -Okay, come on let's get you to the hospital. Okay, no. May I? -Can...? -Hi. -[screaming] -Oh! I'm just checking your reflexes. -[gasps] -They're working. You know, I can handle this. Look, I don't want, you know, to seem difficult, on top of being bloody, but aren't you a veterinarian? -Pete! -What? [chuckling] It's okay. Yes, I am. But you know, we're not that different. And it's just your paw. You missed your front pastern, which is good. You know, you could have nicked a ligament. And well, you know what we'd have to do to you. -Put him down. -[Jennifer] Mmm. Should've done that years ago. -[chuckling] -Okay, you know what? You can take care of me, just don't let him touch me. Okay. -Does he have a first aid kit? -Yeah. Okay. I'm Jennifer, by the way. -Pete. -Hi. [chuckling] [light acoustic guitar music] Well, that's yet another member of my family that appreciates your help. [laughing] I was happy to do it. Consider it my way of saying thank you. I have really enjoyed these last few days. You know, I knew it was the right thing to move here for me, but I've been wondering if it was right for Charlotte. You know, um. But this past week, I mean, it has been so special. There's been all these new opportunities for both of us. I just think that, you know if I had been holding on to the past, I never would've said yes to pie. -[chuckles] -Oh, good, then I don't have to get you a Christmas present. Oh, I'm pretty sure you still do. [chuckling] Well, if it's a gift exchange you're after... [laughing] [gentle music] What? No. Oh no, no, no. [dramatic music] [sobbing] I didn't even want to come here! Why can't everyone just leave me alone? [door slamming] [dramatic music] Another late night? Not the kind you're thinking of. Did you know that Jennifer's place got vandalized last night? Why would I know anything about that? I just figured it was kids from the school. They spray painted her garage and driveway. They broke a bunch of lawn decorations. -You don't know anything about this? -No. High school kids don't keep secrets these days, they put everything out there on the internet. Out there on Snapchat, or whatever. Not anyone I know. Do you know Charlotte Flynn? Is she in any of your classes? Who? Charlotte Flynn, Jennifer's daughter. I guess, sort of. Are you friends with her? I don't make friends as fast as you do, Dad. Is anyone you know friends with her? Why does it matter? Because if we know who she's hanging out with, maybe we'd have idea who'd want to trash her house. I know she auditioned for the Christmas Festival solo. That's it. Really? Jennifer didn't tell me her daughter sang. She probably didn't want to spoil things by telling you her daughter beat me out for the part. Why didn't you tell me? You've been busy. With Uncle Pete and Santa's Workshop. Yeah well, I should've been paying more attention. I'm sorry. I guess there's always senior year. She'll be a senior next year, too. I'm not going to hold my breath. I got to get ready for school. Weill, if you hear anything, please let me know, ok? Because this was way beyond a prank. Yeah. Pancakes should make you feel better. So, whoever did this, maybe they pranked you because you're new? Mom, please. I know what this is about. The Christmas solo. What, the song for the Festival? The minute I decided to audition, this girl, MJ, started hassling me. I guess she thought she deserved to sing the solo and... Even after Ms. Baxter gave it to me, she's been after me. What do you mean, after you? She says nasty things to me every time I see her, she's mean to my friends. She threw a soda on me and almost ruined your... She's vicious. -Why didn't you tell me? -Because I didn't realize it was going to get this bad. -But, did you tell a teacher or something? -No. -Why not? -Just because I thought she'd just get bored and move on to torment someone else. Honey, you should've told me. -What were you going to do? -Well, ah... I could be supportive! So what are we going to do now? I'm just trying to figure that out! Just give me a minute! You know you can always talk to me. Not really. Always! You've been so happy, enjoying your time with Nate. I didn't want to spoil that. Charlotte, you come first. Always. I thought, just for a minute, this Christmas was going to be great. It's still going to be great. [sighing] I'm going to talk to this girl's parents. No, don't, please. It'll just make it a thousand times worse. No, I'll be reasonable, okay? I promise. And hopefully her parents will be, too. But this has to stop. -Alright, what was her name again? -Mom. Charlotte! Everyone calls her MJ. It stands for Melissa Jane. It should really stand for Major Jerk. Ok, what's her last name? I'll call the school. Prentiss. Melissa Jane Prentiss. What? -Eat your breakfast, I'll drive you to school when I get back. -Mom, you don't have to do this. Yes sweetheart, I do! -Well, do you need her address? -I know it. [doorbell ringing] Hey, what a great way to start the day. Come on in. How're you doing? Not good. Not good at all. -Did something else happen? -Yes. Tell me. I can't see you anymore. -What? -I thought you deserved to hear it face-to-face. I don't understand, what... -what happened? -[Melissa] Dad? Yeah, Melissa, just give us a second, would you? No, no it's fine, she should stay. She should hear this. Hi, MJ. I'm Jennifer Flynn, Charlotte Flynn's mom. -Oh. -What you did to my daughter is inexcusable. And if this is your daughter, then you are not the man I thought you were. That's why I came to say goodbye. [sighing] Melissa. Melissa! Tell me what happened. There's nothing to tell. Come on sweetie, the longer you stall, the worse this is going to get. We pranked their house, big deal. That was you? What were you thinking? I didn't do any of the big stuff! Some of the guys did that. And I never... I was mad and I started this stupid meme as a joke, and it spread all over school and people thought it was funny. And then people kept adding on to it, and everyone thought it was funny, but I thought they'd get bored and stop. But Kayla told Bobby we were going to prank Charlotte, and he got the lacrosse team and all of a sudden, it was this big whole thing and I couldn't stop them. How hard did you try? I just wanted to get back at her, I didn't mean to... Get back at her for what? She ruined Christmas! She stole my song. Not according to Ms. Baxter. Yeah, Ms. Baxter decided I couldn't have the song. And Mom decided I couldn't have New York. And you decided I couldn't have Mom. Sweetie, you have to stop taking out your anger at your mom on everybody else. Especially people that had nothing to do with that situation. It's not fair. No, it is not. But it's life and we're going to figure out a way to get through this together. But in the meantime, you got your work cut out for you, kiddo. You're going to pay Jennifer back for the damages. What? How? By working for me. And you're going to give me the names of everybody else -that was involved that can pay their share. -I'll end up with no friends. And you're going to apologize to Jennifer and to Charlotte. And until I see some significant change in your behavior, you're grounded. Give me your cell phone. -Seriously? -Yes! -[grunting] -And you're not going to the concert. -I knew you'd take her side. -It's not about sides, it's about right and wrong, and you are wrong! -So you're not going. -Fine. It's not like anyone's going to miss me. But I am so not apologizing to Charlotte. -Get back here! -Nobody cares about me! Not you, or Jennifer, or Ms. Baxter, or Mom. Nobody! I hate everything! I can't believe you broke up with him because of me! This isn't your fault, Charlotte. I just saw a different side of him -and I wasn't comfortable... -Just because she's awful, doesn't mean he is. -Charlotte, stop. -Stop what? Letting Melissa ruin things for you. So this is my fault now? No, I'm sorry, that was a poor thing to say. [sighing] I tried to handle this, Mom. I know and I'm sure this has been really difficult for you and I'm sorry that I didn't see what was going on. How can I help now? Well, you can't follow me in school. So what are you going to do? I mean this thing has escalated way too far. -How about I go into the principal's office with you? -Please don't. Just... Just give me a day. Audrey and Henry have my back. Just... [sighing] Just let me try to handle this one more time. -[Jennifer] Okay, one more day. -Okay. At least I understand now. Thanks, Eva. [sobbing] -I should've said something... -It's okay, I get it. I'm sorry. Thank you. [light piano music] Your dad's not going to tell my dad, is he? I don't know what he's going to do, okay? Eva, where have you been? -Away from you guys. -What's your deal? My deal? You're the ones who went all "Suicide Squad" on someone we barely even know. So, you're choosing Charlotte over us? Pretty sure I'm picking the decent thing over the awful thing. You're out of control, MJ. I can't stop you, but I sure as heck don't need to be a part of this. [sniffling] -[door clicking] -[stomping] [dramatic music] Go ahead. Say it. [dramatic music] [door closing] [sighing] [Pete] Wow. Yeah, wow. Man! She's mad at you, mad at Jennifer. Mad at the daughter. Doesn't sound like the Melissa I know. No, it doesn't sound the one I know, either. And I went two or three rounds with this one last night. Really? How'd that go? She threw the whole Vivian thing at me. And... The fact that she wants her mom around and I don't. I've just been trying to protect her from all this, and somehow, I ended up being the bad guy. Or just the first in the line of fire. I goes deeper than that. Maybe she's digging at a wound that you want to ignore. Uh-huh. See? [sighing] Vivian cheated on you. And that's 100% wrong. And Melissa needs to know that. Divorce is hard on everyone, especially for children. And you're working so hard to be strong and good that you're not acknowledging the hurt and the real damage that Vivian caused. And if you're not going to work through that, then you're never going to let it go. [sighing] I just want her to understand that we can survive this thing, the two of us. Yeah okay, sure. But you still got to show her that even the strongest of us feel pain. And when you choose to trust and to love that's true strength. Melissa is, [sighing] she's struggling, Nate. Yeah I know she is, brother. So help her let it go. Because if she comes out of this thinking that anger is the only way to be, then we've lost her. [light piano music] -So how was school? -Good. -My Latin quiz was really easy. -[bell ringing] -I'm allowed to be concerned. -Fine, I just don't want to be thinking about it every minute. I mean I am, but I don't want to be. That's good. I've been thinking about something Dad used to say. He always said Christmas means hope and new beginnings. Yeah he did, didn't he? So, maybe MJ needs those things more than I do. Okay, but what does that have to do with you? I want to talk to Ms. Baxter about giving up the solo. -What? -And letting Melissa sing it. What? And let the bully win? No, honey, that is not the way to handle this. -Mom, I don't want to fight. -Look, I'm not going to force you, okay? And I know you don't want to, but let me fight this fight for you. You can't shadow me in school, Mom. You can't fix this. I can talk to the principal, I can talk to Melissa, to Nate... Stop! If you really want to help, come with me to see Ms. Baxter. [sighing] You don't have to do this. Yes, I do. Okay then. Thanks for having my back. Always. [knocking on door] Yes? Are we interrupting? We can come back. Charlotte, why don't you and your mother stay? I'm fairly certain we're all here to discuss the same topic. [bell ringing] [sighing] Are you okay? Have you talked to Charlotte? Talked to Charlotte, about what? [Audrey] The solo. Why, what happened now? She texted this morning. She wants to give it to MJ. No, no way! She'd... Way. If she does that, MJ will be unbearable. Chorus will be so painful, we have to stop Charlotte. Or not. What? I'm saying I respect what Charlotte's saying. She's saying she doesn't need the solo as bad as MJ does. Okay, that's not it. Charlotte's just done with MJ. Like we all should have been a long time ago if someone... Come on, MJ hasn't always been like this, right? You, me, and MJ, we all used to be friends together. That was a long time ago. Like, middle school. Come on, she was fun and sweet, remember? Barely. Look, if it wasn't for her mom and that... Okay yeah, fine, she has a difficult life. But there are plenty of people in this school with difficult lives, and do they run around making everyone else more miserable? No, they don't. Thank you! So, MJ has no excuse. See, when you're surrounded by people that really get you, you don't want to focus on the people that don't. You know, you... You almost want to just, kind of focus in on the people that do. You know? Um. -What's that? -I'm hoping it's not a huge mistake. It can't be a huge mistake, if it's a tiny box. Merry Christmas, Audrey. I don't understand. Oh, you see during Christmas time, there's this custom. -People give gifts to people who receive gifts... -Ha ha ha. I mean we don't exchange gifts till, like, Christmas Day. Why are you giving me... You've been my best friend most of my life and I've never really told you how important that is. So... No, I'm pretty sure you have, once. Third grade. When I told off Annie Zeleski for stealing the cookies out of your lunchbox. [chuckles] Look, all I'm trying to say is I'm really lucky that you're my best friend. Henry. -[chuckles] -And it also made me realize that maybe we could be a lot more? If you'd be into that at all, because I feel stupid. And if I just wrecked everything, I'll take the box back and we'll pretend none of this happened and I'll probably transfer to Antarctica in senior year. [laughing] Please don't! Open it. -Wow. -There's actually also a part two to the gift. The song that I've been working on is actually a song about you.

I just want to understand why you hate me so much. I don't hate you! I hate... how you seem to have everything figured out. You just show up in town and you get the solo and all the people I really care about and... I used to love Christmas. And now, I can't stop being angry. Yeah, we're going to work on that. Together, a lot. I'm sorry about your house and decorations, Dr. Flynn. Thank you, Melissa. And I'm sorry how I acted during auditions, Ms. Baxter. Thank you. And Charlotte, I'm sorry about the solo thing and just for everything. I've been worried about you, MJ. That's why I asked you and your father to come in today. We appreciate that, Ms. Baxter. I just wanted to say, Charlotte, The fact that you're even offering to give up the solo at this point, after what you've been through, you're quite a young lady. Obviously, Charlotte earned the solo, above and beyond anything else that's happened. I'd come hear you sing, but I'm grounded. Break a leg. Well, I'm glad we've been able to resolve that. But, we need to have a separate discussion about your future in the chorus, MJ. What does that mean? We have rules in chorus. You'd kick her out? Why? -It doesn't have anything to do with us, honey. -Yes, it does! She already convinced half the school that I'm such a terrible person, they were happy to wreck our house. What's going to happen when people find out one of the best voices in school got kicked out of chorus because of me? Charlotte, people will believe what people want to believe. Which is how we got into this mess in the first place! If I can forgive her and move on, why can't everyone else? Charlotte!

[laughing] It was June, I was washing the car, and I hear this unbelievable noise from the garage, so I come racing up the driveway, and there you are, up to your ears in tipped over boxes because you tried to drag all the Christmas presents out of here and into the house. When I asked you why, you said... I miss Christmas. You remember! I don't whether I remember, or if I've heard that story enough times that I think I remember. I love that story! I love what it says about you, how you feel about Christmas. I know you miss Christmas this year, sweetie. It isn't what it used to be in our house. I miss a lot of things. So do I.

Ms. Baxter, you could ask her about volunteering or fundraising for chorus, let her know you're serious about coming back. Okay. And you got to talk to me, the next time you have a problem. I will. I swear, Dad. Well, if you can do all that, and you can manage to find your smile again, I suppose you could go to the festival. I will, I promise!

I am begging for forgiveness and I'm using brownies as a bribe. [laughing] That just might work. Well, there's a lot of brownies. Ah, yeah, I think that's going to work. I have a lot to apologize for. -Oh, you don't really. -I do, I do. I didn't know what I was doing. I didn't know how to help Melissa with her mom. I just... I was so busy trying to convince her everything was going to be okay that I lost track of how hurt she was. Not that I'm making excuses. What, that you're just an imperfect parent, you know. There's a few of us around town. -[chuckling] Oh yeah? -Hm. You seem to be doing pretty good. Oh, I hope so. But that didn't mean I needed to come down on you so hard.
