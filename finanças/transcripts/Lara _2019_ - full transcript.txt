LARA - Morning. - Morning. - Yes... - Sorry to disturb you. Mrs Jenkins, maybe you remember. We've met before. Official business. A while ago. Anyway... We need you to witness a house search. What's happened? I can't tell you that here. The order only just arrived. Just a house search. It won't take long. I'd like to help, but I'm busy at the moment. Right. Come on, Mrs Jenkins. You know how it is. Make an effort. You're a public servant too. I'm retired. Once a public servant, always a public servant? Have you made progress with the old bag? Yes, almost done. Right, Mrs Jenkins? - I'll need a moment, OK? - Yes, of course. And don't forget your ID. And thank you. We're on our way. Can you tell me what's going on? What are they looking for? I'm talking to you. What do you want? If you're in trouble, talk to me. I'm sure I can help. - You want to help? - Of course I do. Have you looked in the mirror recently? You think I want to end up like you? Hey, cut it out! Don't ever do that again. You wanker. How's your little boy, Mrs Jenkins? What's good old Victor up to? - He's very well, thanks. -Yeah? My old man doesn't hear him tinkling anymore. Has he finally moved out? Watch it. May I? So, I need your ID, please? Thank you. If you don't need me any more, I'd like to go. OK, then. See you next time. Beautiful instrument. May I? Go ahead. Hang on. No... Your signature, please? Always the same place. Thank you. And your ID. Happy birthday. It's your birthday? Yes. Sixtieth. Hello, Viktor, it's me. I wanted to wish you luck for tonight... In case you want to call me, in case something's planned today, I'm available all day. OK, then. I'm sending lots of strength. - Good morning! - Good morning! I'd like to withdraw my entire balance. - Your entire balance? - Yes. - Good morning. - Hello! An espresso, please. Mrs Jenkins. I was just about to visit you. Many happy returns. And sorry again about earlier. It happens. No, my son has problems, but he's no criminal. I'm sure of that. I can take the flowers home and put them in water. - You probably need to go. - No, no. Thanks. You can get them later. No problem. Thank you. I really have to go. Of course. And have a lovely birthday! - How many do you need? - How many do you have left? I've got 22 tickets, mainly together, but at the back of the hall. - Nothing closer to the front? - No, I'm afraid not. We're as good as sold out. Sorry. OK, I'll take them. - All of them? - Yes. OK. Here you go. - Thanks, Mrs Jenkins. - Isn't it time we were less formal? I'm Lara. - Marion... - So... So, Lara... Actually, I ought to give you something, Mrs Jenkins. I mean: Lara. That's the point. I've had 59 birthdays I'd like to try something else at last. We'll go to this lovely concert, and then go for a drink. - Just us two? - No, no. No, there'll be lots of friends there. And you, of course. And Katharina. Is Katharina there? Yes. Shall I let her know you're here? I'd like to surprise her. She might not like that. Nor me. Marion. Please. It's nice of you to drop in. I'm a little surprised. Is it strange to be back again? Not at all. I'm glad you're feeling better. So how are you? Well... I'll be happy when it's over. For me, it was wonderful. Perhaps the most beautiful time of my life. - Really? - Absolutely. For a moment, nothing else mattered at all. To be honest, I'm terrified of the pain. The pain is not the problem. Great, Marion. Thank you. Thanks, Marion. - Pleasure. Tell me, did you already send the email to Mr Schreiber? I'm just correcting it. It needs to go out today. Like I said, I'm correcting it. Sometimes I want to slap her in the face. I mean, what am I supposed to do? It's a catastrophe. She respected you, and since you left they all do whatever they want. - Do you take sugar? - No. How did you do it? I mean, how did you make people here respect you? I think it was just because I didn't care about the job at all. But... You always seemed so passionate. No. Passion's the last thing I'd associate with my work here. No, no. I fulfilled a duty. I got it done. It's very simple. Weren't you ever bothered no one here could stand you? I know some people who literally hated you. What are you doing tonight? Hello, Viktor. It's me again. You're probably very busy today, but I thought it'd be nice to meet beforehand, to go for a coffee or a walk... Yeah? OK. Give me a call, yeah? Everything OK? Yes, thanks. Well, just so you know, we have 20% off cocktail dresses today. That's pretty. - You think? - But maybe a bit too conservative? - I see. Hang on. I'll show you something. Oh, yes. Oh, it's amazing how that looks on you! Really lovely. - Honestly. - Thanks. I think it's a bit short, and... God, it's a bit tight. - No, absolutely not! Look how it emphasises your figure. No, believe me. It's beautiful. I promise you, you'll definitely make an entrance in this. Maybe I'll wear it right away. - Gladly. - Thanks. - I'll just take the tag off. - Good. Excuse me. I'm looking for Professor Reinhofer. He went for some fresh air. Did he say when he'd be back? Do you mind if I wait? So, what's the professor like? Does he make your life difficult? He's OK. Why don't you use the time to practise? The professor's not here. So? There must be something you can practise. What are you playing at the moment? Go on, then. Play it for me. Come on. Play it. That wasn't so bad. From the top again. Allegretto. You need to learn technique. You'll never get anywhere without it. Again. Good. Good. Go on. Tempo. Yes. It's really not so hard. Are you going to do that at your audition? Just give up? That's going to be embarrassing for everyone. If you just stumble from note to note? No edge, no ambition. Your poor parents. Come on. Show me. So how old are you? Thirteen. Thirteen. Thirteen. Maybe you'd be better at trumpet? Right. From the top again. Come on. ...I just encouraged you to practise... ...it was you alone who worked tirelessly... Excuse me? Yes? Are you Lara Jenkins? Yes? I know you from a photo. I'm Johanna, Viktor's girlfriend. Ah yes, of course. - Viktor told you about me? - Viktor tells me everything. So, sit down. Thank you. You play in the orchestra, right? No, sadly not. I'm still studying. - I see. Violin, eh? Yes. Are you planning to move in together? I'm not sure. We've only known each other a few months. Honestly, right now I'm not sure if we're still together. Doesn't look like it. What happened? I don't know. Well, he doesn't answer if I call. He doesn't text anymore. I was hoping maybe you'd know what's up. When was he last in touch? Almost two months ago. Since he moved in with his grandmother. I don't know. Maybe it was all moving too fast. He always doubts himself. - Doubts himself? - Yes. He constantly doubts himself. And he's obsessed with what he's doing. I'll tell you something. I think his doubts are justified. After all, he's set his sights high. And so we understand each other, it's perfectly OK to dream big. But you need to know your limits. How do you mean? Maybe he's going through a big disappointment. - Yes? That could be it. - What kind of disappointment? You taught him yourself. Yes. Yes. Yes. But what if he's not as.... talented as we all hoped? What if he's no genius? No, he's definitely no genius. The concert's sold out. I'm well aware of that. Sorry. I just wish he'd get in touch. - Why not try now? - What? To call him. Maybe you'll get through. He's got a rehearsal. He'll never answer. True. Here. My pleasure. Come to the concert. Maybe he'll be responsive afterwards. Thanks. But I have a season ticket from uni. Excuse me. I'll be right back. You're a pianist yourself, right? I worked for the city administration. - I ran the department for... - You should believe in your son. Excuse me. Lara? What are you doing here? - I could ask you the same. - I need to talk to Viktor. - Not now. He's doing an interview. - Then I'll wait. It might take a while. But you'll see him on stage later. - I just need to know how he is. - He's very well. - I'd like to hear that from him. - Lara, please. Just give him some space. Tonight's his night. Don't act like I want to hurt him. He's worked hard. The last weeks have really paid off. Since when were you the judge of that? You, who wanted him to become a construction engineer. God. So he's really surrounded himself with sycophants. Do you know what a mess you're making? Mess? Viktor's doing great. And his piece is fantastic. And I'm not the only one saying that. - Who, then? - None of your business. Anyway, you'll see a lot of important people tonight. Lara, please. I'd like to know what's planned tonight. Viktor wanted me to give you the tickets. Are you bringing anyone? Well, you can certainly sit with us. Please tell Viktor I took care of my own tickets. I didn't know you drive a taxi. I've been in taxis all my life. But normally where you're sitting. No, you're right. My license is still pretty new. You know, after I retired, I didn't know what to do with myself. Finally, I pulled myself together, sat down and wrote a list of ten things I have to do before it's too late. A taxi license was number two. Anyway, I'm up to all sorts of things I'd never got around to. The other day, for example, I was at a community college information evening. I've now enrolled for... - Sorry, can you turn it up a bit? Of course. So... Thank you very much. No, please don't. It's your birthday. My son Viktor's playing a concert. I'd be delighted if you could come. It's tonight. I've already got a ticket. I saw his poster, so of course I bought a ticket right away. Then... maybe see you later. See you later. Mummy? Mother! Mother? Viktor's not here. It's you I came to see. Has something happened? What's supposed to happen? Happy birthday. Thank you, Mummy. - I brought this for you. - What is it? There you are. - Is that marzipan? - No. - I can't stomach marzipan. - It isn't marzipan. I can't eat that stuff since my diabetes. I know. It isn't marzipan. It's a diet cake. I baked a cake this morning. Good. Then we'll put this cake in the fridge. There's no more room. Try it. Well, go on. Try it. Tastes good. I baked it for Viktor. New underwear? Yes, it was about time. About tonight... I'm not going. What do you mean, you're not going? You know perfectly well I'm not going. Yes, I know. You don't even know where to start with this music. You never did. You think the people are awful. You hate all the snobbery. But, for once in your life, couldn't you maybe make an exception? Your grandson's playing his own composition. The concert's sold out. I've spoken to Viktor. He understands. Besides, it's my birthday. I'm afraid you've come all this way for nothing. Anyway, I'm not going to be bribed with a cheap cake. Diet cake! Have you ever tried one? No one can eat that. That's so egoistic. You've tormented him for years. A competition here, a scholarship there. And whenever he got close, you tugged on his leash. And that, my dear Lara, is egoistic. That's not true. - I look after Viktor now. I do his washing, bake his cakes, put up with his plink-plonking. And, unlike you, he's never complained. You've only ever cared about yourself. Just like your father. - I get it. And now you're getting cold feet, because everyone's abandoning you. First your husband, and now your son. - Where's Viktor? - Washing his hands. Mum? Happy birthday. Thank you. Are you well? Yes. That's good. And... I'm well too. I'm up to all sorts of things I never got around to before. That's not what I meant. So what did you mean? What do you think of it? Think of what? You were in my room. I saw you at the window. Yes, I think it's good. I like it. - Yes? Yes. And what exactly does that mean: you 'like' it? It's clever, and elegantly composed. In a few places I was... pretty surprised. Surprised? - Yes. Don't you think it loses its harmonic grip too much? No. No, no. Quite the opposite. It's... interesting. And the string arrangements? I can't comment on them much. I don't know enough about that. Are you coming tonight? Your main theme's very catchy. Maybe a bit too catchy. What do you mean? What do I mean? Probably what I'm saying. Too catchy how... Too cute? Too facile? Yes, if you like. Yes. Too affected. But maybe I just didn't understand it. It's you who needs to like it. Do you like it? I haven't rejected it yet, so I guess I like it. Why do you compose? No, Viktor. Why do you compose? I... I compose because I believe... I can express myself better that way than purely as a performer. But what do you want to express with your main theme ? You want to express something. Yes. Yes, I want to express something. I... I want... I don't know... You're such a talented pianist, and you should be truly proud of that. There's so much wonderful music in the world. You show up four hours before my concert and tell me my main theme is 'affected'? - No, I didn't say that. - That's exactly what you said. That's exactly what you said. You asked for my opinion, Viktor. What am I supposed to do now? Professor Reinhofer? Excuse me. This is for you. Do you remember me? I'm Lara. Lara Jenkins. I came by the school earlier this afternoon. You were getting some fresh air. So... - That was you asking for me? - Yes. Viktor Jenkins. Was he one of my pupils? Viktor's my son. So I think in a sense you taught him too. You really don't remember me? I was one of your students. I'm sorry, but there've been so many. But you always made jokes about my left hand. About my 'anal' left hand. You alway said that my left hand holds back too much, and won't let go. - Sorry, what was your name? - Lara. Lara Jenkins. Lara Jenkins, yes... I think I remember now. You were extremely ambitious. Insanely ambitious. - Yes. - Then you stopped attending lessons. Correct. And Viktor's your son, you say? Well, then you must be very proud of him. The concert begins at 8. I'd love it if you could make it. Well, that's in an hour and a half. I'll have to see if I can manage. Will it be worth it? You tell me. After the concert. - We'll see. - I'm sure you'll like it. That would definitely be a surprise. Nice coat. Thanks. This is a concert ticket. It's for you. It's about to start. Good evening. Thank you. - Have a nice evening. - Thank you. Good evening, Mrs Jenkins. Good evening. Have you enjoyed your birthday? - It's only really starting now, right? - Yes. It's going to be a lovely night, when I think how the day started. You brought me luck. I drove all day. - Long trips, nearly all of them. - That's great. I... I wanted to ask you... Would you maybe like to have dinner with me sometime? Or... go to the cinema? We could also listen to music together. Think about it, and, if not, I totally understand. You're very busy too. Yes... - What? - Was that necessary? I'll be off. No, no. Allow me to introduce Mr Czerny. - Good evening. - Good evening. - And... - I asked you to leave him in peace. - Do you go to many classical concerts? - Me? Not often, actually. Even on a day like this, you can't keep a little distance. - I don't know what you mean. - You know exactly what I mean. I'll take my coat to the coatroom. But we'll meet after the concert. With pleasure. What? You just don't get it. Does anyone need a ticket? Yes. Yes, me. Us too, please. - My pleasure. - How much? Thank you. - Here you go. - Thank you. - I'd love one too. - No, not you. - What? - Might you have a ticket for me? - Yes, of course. - Thank you very much. - Good evening. - Good evening. Am I too late? - Here you are. - But you gave me one already. In the toilet. - Then I'll take it. - Oh, yes. Here you go. Excuse me. I can pay. - Hello. - Hello. - You need to go over there. - Have fun. See you later. Hello. Good evening. I'm glad you could make it. Lara! Lara! So? How are you? I heard you're much better. I was in the office today, and ran into Marion. She can't make it, but she gave me her ticket. I really want to see what your son does live. Barbara... We should get going. We have to take our seats. We'll see you later. So your son's a composer? Well, yes. You didn't mention that. He's actually a pianist. Well, normally it's not a good sign when they start composing. Excuse me. Excuse me. I think those are our seats. Of course. You're right. Excuse me. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Hello. - Thanks for the tickets. - Thank you. I'm Clara, and this is Tobi. Good evening. Did lots of your group cancel? Excuse me? Did lots of your group cancel? My group? Because you had so many tickets left. That's the artist's mother. - Really? No shit? - Really? And we get to sit next to you? Crazy. What's going on, Lara? Isn't it meant to start? Maybe there's a technical problem. Ladies and gentlemen... First, I'd like to warmly welcome you to this special evening. Sadly, we've had a technical problem. Viktor Jenkins will now not be playing his composition. Instead we'll hear Études from Opus 10 by Frédéric Chopin. We'll see each other after the interval. - Vodka and tonic, please. - With pleasure. There you go. Another, please. OK. Here you go. Here. Thank you. Lara. Your son is good. - Yes? -Yes. - Much better than I imagined. - Really? Exquisite technique. - Yes. - But what happened? - Didn't he want to play his own piece? - Yes. Yes. I remember you very well now, Lara. - It's all coming back. - There you are! I'll get a drink before it starts again. That was absolutely fantastic. Thank you. Thank you so much. This is Frank, my husband. - Nice to meet you. - He works at the land registry. Mrs Jenkins ran the department I've just taken over. And she's the pianist's mother. Oh, your son plays wonderfully. - Thank you. - Totally brilliant. I used to play the piano a bit, about 15 years ago, right? Well, it's great he's up there, all alone at the piano, that's... Could you hold this, please? Viktor, I really know how you feel. When I was in charge of the Havel Bridge construction, I was scared shitless. I'm still scared the thing will collapse when I cross it! These were terrifically complex plans, and I barely had any experience with free-floating construction so for me... I don't think you can compare the two. No, you're right. Probably not. But what's the worst thing that can happen? The worst thing is she's right. She's right. And she's the only one who dares to tell the truth. It's mediocre music. Dad, Dad.... - What's she done to you? - There's nothing new in the music. No one needs it. What did she do to you to make you so dependent on her opinion? If she told you now you're great, would that make you a better musician? Listen. Forget everything she ever told you. Today's just about you. Son. Dad, I'd like to be alone. OK, I'm leaving. Will you be OK? Please take your seats. Good evening. Good evening. Are you enjoying your birthday? Yes. - Congratulations. - Thank you. Everything OK? A pack of Ouest, please. Thank you very much. Thank you. I really appreciate it. So tonight is really a very special evening for me. To stand here on stage with these great musicians, and to play in front of such a fantastic, and, yes, patient audience... It really means everything to me. But it's not just a special evening for me. I'd like to dedicate this concert to my mother. She's 60 today, and everything I know about music, she taught me, with gentle pressure. Without her, I wouldn't be who I am. All the best, Mum. And all of you, get home safe, and thank you again. Thank you so much. - Really impressive. - Thank you. Lara, there you are. Where were you? Sorry, I totally forgot your birthday. Many happy returns. - Bravo. - You must be so proud! That he'd even dare play solo! We've earned a strong drink, don't you think? I just need to talk to Viktor first. We should go somewhere. - Congratulations. - Congratulations. I liked it a lot. I'll go ahead for that drink. Maybe you can join me. I can introduce you? There's a brasserie opposite. I'll wait. Let's all go. Sounds good. - I'll catch up with you. - There you are! Thank you very much! Congratulations! It was fantastic. Thank you. Sorry I haven't been in touch. I just needed some space. Hello, Viktor. Mum. Hello. Good evening, Johanna. Good evening, Mrs Jenkins. - You know each other? - We've met. I'll leave you now. Just call me when you want. Thanks. Viktor... Dear Viktor... Thank you for tonight, and for this beautiful birthday present, the most beautiful thing a son can do for his mother. - That went so well! - You played so well. - See you later? - For sure. - We'll have a drink. -Definitely. I'd never have dreamed it, but all I did was encourage you to practise and... Sorry, quickly. We can get a table for twenty in the brasserie opposite. Is that enough? - Yes. - Yes? Good. We'll take the table. Anyway, it was you alone who worked tirelessly and never gave up his dream. And maybe you remember... May I congratulate you on your compositional debut? - Thank you very much. -I'm impressed by your melodic courage. The way you start the piece with the main motif... As you know, in our musical landscape, that's rather a bold gamble, isn't it? I mean, how you deploy your own personality, that's a sign of maturity, especially at your age. So it just remains to say: Fantastic, and I'm excited about what you do next. Thanks. That really means a lot. Especially from you. - Enjoy the party. - Thank you. So who was that? Shall we get going, then? Yes. Hang on a second, I've got a little something for you. Take a look. I'm sorry. I didn't have enough time. It's from Rogacki. Your favourite place. Thank you. - Get changed. We need to head over. - Yes. OK. Good. Please, Viktor, I still need a word. Please, Mum... I'm exhausted. I'll call you, OK? Yes? Enjoy your evening. To Lara! Cheers! To the birthday girl! All the best! - Cheers! - Many happy returns. Lara, have you got a cigarette for me as well? Yes, of course. I didn't know you smoked. Well, I just take a puff. We were just saying how your son dedicated the concert to you. Unfortunately, you were outside. Dedications, speeches... - They're all meaningless. - I agree. This is Professor Reinhofer. The professor teaches piano. So you taught Viktor? In a sense. The professor is a legend. And what did you think of the concert? Pretty good. Especially the first half. Good evening. - There he is! Maybe let's sit down first. Are we back there? - Or would you rather... - No, no! We'll sit back there. OK, come on. You know, I have great respect for Lara here. She didn't think she was good enough, so she just gave up playing. Yes. Didn't I have good reason? I knew I'd never make it to the top. - You confirmed that. - That's what I told everyone. Either you have it, or you don't. And when I said things like that, it was to see if someone would really see it through. But that wasn't the only reason. My left hand... Your left hand wasn't the reason, just an excuse. In truth, you were quite talented, Lara. - What do you mean? - Just what I said. No. You told me to spare my parents the embarrassment. I remember precisely. You said... "Lara... When I think about your first public performance, I already feel sorry for your parents's humiliation." I don't believe you. You thought I had talent? Yes, you have talent. Or had it. Many people have talent. But what's that got to do with me? Thank you for the lovely evening. Good night! - Mrs Jenkins. - Did I wake you? No, not at all. Do you want to come in? - Yes. - Then come in. Please, sit down. The concert tonight. It was phenomenal. Really. And Viktor's speech too. It was so touching. I had to go out. I needed some fresh air. Please, sit down. - Can I get you anything? - Here. Thank you. - I'll get two glasses. - Not for me, thanks. I've had enough already. That's for you. Are you sure you won't sit? Shall I make us some tea? I'll make some tea. This one piece of music, the first piece, I liked that best. It's so... dynamic somehow. This whole energy... It's incredible. Tell me, what kind of tea do you want? I have... rosehip and peppermint. LARA
