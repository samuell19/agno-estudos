A flying pickle? What have I done? A crime against humanity. I didn't direct a movie, I committed a crime. Why is this limo so hot? It's like a gas chamber in here. You made a commercial movie, Harry. I made toilet paper. I think the kids will go for it. I committed artistic suicide. You will certainly die from those filthy French cigarettes. I was sitting in a 400-year-old stone house in Aix-en-Provence, Drinking an unbelievable chablis, and I went back to Hollywood and committed suicide. Why? Tell me why I did it, Phil? $400,000 in back taxes. Then there's the question of your two alimonies. Plus the fact your last few films have not been hits, Harry. How about three disasters in a row? Three huge bomberinos, the record. But The Pickle will be a hit. My nose tells me, and my nose is usually dependable. How do you know it's going to be a hit? You haven't seen it. Okay, it's a bomb. I told you. (PEOPLE CHATTERING) I'll be right out front if you need me, Mr. Stone. Great. I may go see my mother. Don't forget you have an interview with the guy from The Times at 4:00. Cancel it. I'm not talking to the press. (WHISTLE BLOWS) It's not a review, Harry. It's just a little story about you being back in the States again. The Times has buried me three times in a row. Why should I help them make it four? You already agreed to it. Welcome to the plaza, Mr. Stone. It's an honor to have you with us. You're new, aren't you? What happened to, uh... What's his name? The white-haired guy. Mr. Clark died two years ago. You have several messages, Mr. Stone. (SIGHS) I'll take it, thank you. This way, gentlemen. (PEOPLE CHATTERING) The studio called. How many seats do you want for the preview? Zero seats. I don't go to my own funerals. Ellen called. Oh, sure, she probably wants to see the picture. She'll enjoy the carnage. Mmm-hmm. (SIGHS) Your daughter called. Huh. I got to get something for the baby. Phil, Phil, do me a favor. Yeah. Run down to Schwartz's and get me a toy, a nice big panda. I can't wait to see the baby. I hear she's already walking. (EXCLAIMS) My God. You're Harry Stone. (EXHALES) I've seen every one of your pictures. Uh, Purple Charlatan, Roman Christmas. That, for me, was a masterpiece. I love your pictures. I thought Blue Dust was the best Western ever made. (STAMMERING) I know I'm gushing and you're a busy man, but this is a great thrill for me. Well, thank you. (STAMMERING) I write copy for Bloomingdale's, but I always wanted to write for film. But, oh, don't worry, I don't have a script for you. (LAUGHING) You know what my favorite is? What? Paradise Jack. Oh. Oh, I loved Paradise Jack. I think the critics were all wrong. Lady, we got to go. Oh, well, thank you, Mr. Stone. And good luck with the preview of The Pickle tomorrow. Thank you. (CHUCKLES) How the hell did she know there was a preview tomorrow? The word is on the street, Harry. I told you, The Pickle is a hit. How, how, how did I ever let myself Be talked into doing this piece of teenage drek? You got smart. Don't you remember? You agreed to fly out to the coast And take a meeting with Ronnie Liebowitz. He'd just been made head of the studio. Merv, I don't have time to read a 555-page novel about an Eskimo. MERV: (OVER PHONE) I understand that. I'll call him. Just option it. Fine. I don't care what it costs. It's an epic. I love it. Good-bye. Ciao. They're here? Fine. Send them in. (PHONE RINGING) Oh, my God. It's Harry Stone. This is my dream come true. Ow. Oh, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry, I have to get those trimmed. Hello, Phil. Hello, Ronnie. Good to see you. Well, come on, come on. Come on in. Come on. Sit, make cozy. Make cozy. You know, Mr. Stone, I've seen now... Well, I have seen Blue Dust 29 times. Jesus. You look to be about 16 or 17 at the most. Oh, I wish. It's just that I've... Well, I lost a ton of weight recently, so I look a lot younger. Anywho, you didn't fly in all the way from France just to talk about my weight. (CHUCKLES) If I breathe, I gain weight. Well, we can fix that. Try drinking only distilled water, six quarts a day, a slice of papaya for lunch, a bowl of brown rice for dinner. Absolutely no noshing. What's The Pickle? The Pickle. Well, The Pickle is a film idea that I have... About a bunch of farm kids from... Kansas, Idaho. You know, somewhere warm and grassy. A bunch of typical blond-haired farm kids who are into growing these really, like, super-duper large cucumbers for the county fair. Well, all of a sudden, they discover That one of the cucumbers won't stop growing. It gets bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger. And bigger. And whoosh. What do you mean, "bigger and bigger and bigger"? I mean, that the cucumber turns into a spaceship. That's what I mean. A spaceship? What's the matter, Phil? You never heard of a cucumber turning into a spaceship? Don't you read the L.A. Papers? Of course, it's completely absurd. Completely. I'm talking about... Rob "gorgeous" Lowe, Molly Ringwald, and Tom Cruise flying, flying to the moon on a pickle. I'm talking hysterically funny. Hey, kid, are you really the head of production for this studio? Or is some gigantic joke being played on an old man? Mr. Stone, I want to take the depth and the irony, and the black comedy, and the social commentary, and the absolutely brilliant, razor-sharp, committed timing that distinguishes the films of Harold Stone. And I want to mix it into the stew with this silly little commercial piece of Hollywood silliness, and I want to see what happens. And I'm prepared to pay you a ton of money. When do you want to shoot this thing? Tomorrow. (CHUCKLES) Tomorrow morning. HARRY: That's too much smoke. MAN: I know, Harry. I got it. It's under control. HARRY: Jesus Christ. That's too much smoke. MAN: I know that. And it should be green and more mysterious. They're landing on a new planet. I want poetry. Go gather the cast. Okay, for rehearsal? No, we're gonna shoot the rehearsal, all right? Lisa, get me some coffee with Sweet'n Low. Alberto, how's the light? The light is bad. What? Alberto, I got a mountain of work ahead of me. We're gonna shoot it anyway. The Pickle is juicy. When she... The what? The Pickle is juicy. When she hit the ground, she don't look like-a pickle juice. She look like-a green water. Billy, you hear that? What? I need thicker pickle juice. Any thicker, it's gonna look like Jell-O, Harry. MAN: Come down. I can't even see The Pickle. We ready to go? Too late. It's too dark. Look. Let's shoot it. Scene 303. Take one. Action! EXTRAS DIRECTOR: Background action. A.D.: Door. (CREAKING) (WHIRRING) Pickle juice! (PEOPLE LAUGHING) (LAUGHING) Thank you. Thank you very much. Who gave them permission to shoot in front of the plaza? "Much success manana. Love, Ronnie and Mike." Who's Mike? Mike Krakower, head of distribution. His right-hand man. Another little boy? No, he's the one who forged all those checks. (SIREN WAILING) Oh, I have a pain. A shooting pain down my entire neck. Phil, is there any way we can burn the print? PHIL: Tomorrow night, at this time, they'll be coming out of your preview, and you'll be a hero again. I've got to buy one of those blood pressure kits. It's normal to be scared. The worst thing that can happen is that it'll bomb. (CHUCKLING) Phil. You think it's a bomb, don't you? I haven't seen it, remember? I'm goin'. I have to see my dentist. Isn't your dentist in L.A.? Yeah, but one of my crowns is loose, and there's a good guy here, or so my nephew tells me. Now I have bicoastal dentists. "Bicoastal"? "Bicoastal." I love you, Phil. Sure. Who else would take the crap I've taken for 35 years? Give me a kiss. Yeah, right. Call me. Bye-bye. I'll leave the toy panda at the desk. (SIGHS) I want to go to bed with you. Or on the floor. I don't care where. I just want to make love to you. I want to have sex with Harry Stone. And I'm gonna do it. All my life, I've been a wimp about not following through with my fantasies. Well. I've wasted six good years in analysis if we don't have sex. Uh, care for a drink? (CHUCKLES) No. Am I gonna have to undress you? (STAMMERING) Uh, what's, uh, your name? Bernadette. Oh. My friends call me Bernie. Hey, there's no involvement. I will not bother you in the future. This is a one-time thing. It's sexual. (SIGHS) (GRUNTS) I have no social diseases, and I assure you, I will never tell my husband. Your husband? Oh, Mr. Stone. Harry. Can't you understand what this is all about? You make fantasies. You excite people like me. Well, now I'm gonna live one of my fantasies. I'm gonna have sex with one of the greatest directors of all time. (THUMPING) HARRY: This is a lot better than one of my movies. (PHONE RINGING) (PANTING) Harry Stone. Ellen. How are you? I'm fine. About a half hour ago. (GROANS) It's a little chilly in here. The room is cold. Oh, sure, I'd love to see you. Uh, no, don't come up. I'll, I'll be right down. Five minutes. Right. My wife is here. My ex-wife. One of my many exes. There's a script i'd like you to read, Harry. (PANTS) (MOANING) (PEOPLE CHATTERING) Hi, Ellen. Hi. Oh, you look tired. I was just raped by a fan. Oh. (GIGGLING) Are you here alone? Uh, Phil came in with me. Johnnie Walker black, straight up, and a glass of ice water on the side. Yes, sir. Where's the girl? Francoise? Francoise. She's in Paris. You look wonderful, Ellen. Hmm. Are you working? I'm doing a soap. So this week I'm rich and happy. Any boyfriends? Well, you know. I did go out on a date last weekend, out in the island. I went to a drive-in movie with this retired professor. It was terrible. I had to slap him in the face three times. He got fresh? No, I thought he was dead. (LAUGHING) Come on, Harry. That's a very old joke. So you're not in love, and I'm shacking up with a girl younger than our daughter. "Shacking up"? God, I haven't heard that expression in years. It's our daughter I came to talk to you about. Is Carrie okay? Absolutely. She's a great mother. I can't wait to see the baby. Oh, it's so beautiful. But you know, she's back working part-time again, did you know that? But she's broke. I mean, they're always broke. How can they be broke? Did he lose his job? Harry. (LAUGHING) Your left eye is starting to tic, Harry. I mean, they just live $20,000 a year over their head. So I loaned them $20,000. And where did you get $20,000? From you. The old alimony you finally paid me. Thank you very much. Once more unto the breach. Ah, so what's the problem? No problem. I just want you to split the $20,000 with me. You're her father. Well, as I recall, you got $80,000 from me. $80,000 hardly buys underwear these days, Harry. 80 big ones? 80 big ones. Yes or no, Harry? You gonna see the movie tomorrow? Absolutely, of course. If I'm not rehearsing, sure. Okay, I'll tell Phil to draw up a check for $10,000. Thank you. The picture is a turkey. Teenage drivel. Really? Then why did you do it? To buy your underwear. Oh, now that's a new one. Right? Now you're blaming me for making shitty movies? Why did we ever break up? Do you have a year? Come up to my room. I don't think you could handle it. Good God, you're sexy. (SIGHS) I think this movie will finish me. You can always teach. I was thinking of suicide. Oh, you just... You know, you're always scared before a preview. Why did I make this piece of lip-gloss? Why didn't I make what I wanted to make? Why didn't I make Huckleberry Finn? Remember Huckleberry Finn? I always loved that idea. I wanted to do Huck as a battered child. Tough, gritty. None of that sentimental crap we got in the old version. And this spunky, funny kid is America, going through its crazy growing pains. It sounds a lot better than The Pickle. Who asked for your honesty? I'm sorry. Harry, I got to go. I'll be late for rehearsal. I love you. See you tomorrow. (PEOPLE CHATTERING) (CAR HORN BLARING) (WHISTLE BLOWING) Francoise: Harry! Harry! (CAR HORN BLARING) Mmm. Hey, Francie. Oh, what an adorable panda. Is it for me, Harry? It's for my grandchild. What the hell are you doing here, Francoise? I'm going to be with you for the preview. You need me to take care of you. Not to mention my body. Hey, look. Uh, Francoise, look, (STAMMERING) I... Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah. Look, I, look, (STAMMERING) I don't have the energy to play with you. Get in the car. Get in the car. (CAR HORN BLARING) I missed you terribly. Also, I've, I've good news for you. (CHUCKLES) I got the role in the film. I'm gonna play the girl who's kidnapped. Great. Great. You're not happy for me? I, I mean, my mom was happy. I mean, she tried to pretend, but she was very happy for me. I'm happy for you. Do you love me, Harry? Right now, the only thing I love is my fear. (PEOPLE CHATTERING) I don't know how long we'll be. I'll be right here, Mr. Stone. Are you hungry or anything? I had a sandwich before. Harry. Carrie. Carrie. (GRUNTS) Who's this? Who's this? This is Molly. Molly, can you say hello to grandpa Harry? Can grandpa pick you up? Hi, uh, I'm Francoise. Hi. Harry's girlfriend. I'm Carrie. Hi. Molly, grandpa has a panda for you. Has she ever seen a panda? We were just about to go up to the park for a walk, but let's go inside for a while. Oh, no. No, no, no, let's walk. We'll leave the panda in the limo. Oh, she wants her panda. Oh, my God. I apologize, Molly. Grandpa is sorry. MOLLY: My grandpa. HARRY: (COOING) Yeah, my grandpa. MOLLY: (CRYING) God, I apologize, Molly. I'm sorry. Look. I wanna go with Mommy! Here's your panda. What about grandpa? HARRY: Ooh! CARRIE: She's stubborn. She's a real Taurus. You still don't believe in that crap? Only when it works. I'm a Libra. I've missed you, Harry. How's David? He's seeing a therapist, but he's okay. I saw your mother a few minutes ago. Did she tell you about the money? Yeah, no sweat. We went 50-50. We'll pay it back. I borrowed some money from my mother and father. My father is always angry with me. That's sad. They think your father's too old for me. I wonder why. You know, age is a state of mind. Have you seen The Pickle? How could she see The Pickle? The preview's tomorrow. I always get nervous at those things, but I'll be there. Harry has a cassette of the film, but he will not let me see it. He's afraid The Pickle is gonna be a bomb. CARRIE: What? I'm sick and tired of talking about the rotten, miserable, turkey-of-a-piece-of-shit movie. You're getting crazy, Harry. Go catch a plane back to Paris. You're scaring the baby. I'm sorry. Yeah, you're always sorry. Go home, Francoise! (BABY CRYING) It was very nice meeting you, Carrie. Bye, Molly. You still want me to split? "Split"? We just don't use words like that any more, Francoise. I like "split." It's very poetic. You can see the person physically separating from his own body. (SIGHING) This bridge is the all-time champ. Someday we'll walk across it. Let's do it now. I never have sex in the limo when I'm on my way to see my mother. BOTH: (GIGGLING) Then show me The Pickle. Show me The Pickle. You're tickling me. Stop it. I know you have the tape. How do you know? I'm a spy. A spy of love. "Harry, split. I want to split, Harry." Then show me The Pickle. (LAUGHING) Give me... Give me the miserable tape. No. You can see it tomorrow. (MUSIC PLAYING ON TAPE) Giddy-up. Get. (HENS CLUCKING) Oh, man. MISSION CONTROL: Pickle one is now on full internal power. MAN: We have ignition sequence. Pickle juice is completely pressurized. Vents closed. We are go. Pressure on board, 15. Power transfer is ready. We are on automatic sequence. (SIREN WAILING) (CLANGING) Ready, Clem? Ready, Molly-girl. ALL: Ready, Molly-girl. All right, let's get this pickle off the ground. MISSION CONTROL: Stand by for mode one bravo. Trajectory guidance systems are all go. Mode one bravo. Ten, nine, eight... Mode one bravo complete. Seven, six, five... Engines go. (PEOPLE SCREAMING) Say goodbye to Molly-girl. MISSION CONTROL: Three, two, one. Launch commit. Wow! This is super-cool, Harry. (LAUGHS) It's, it's like The Marx Brothers. Oh, you're stoned. Reminds me of my old neighborhood. MORGAN BEATTY: This is Morgan Beatty in our nation's capital. We have a late bulletin. Vice President Truman has just announced before taking the oath of office as 32nd president of the United States that he has asked the Roosevelt cabinet to remain in office. We have more details now on the death of the president. The White House staff will... Grandma, grandpa, President Roosevelt is dead. He had a massive cerebral hemorrhage. We know, heshele. We know. I saw him once with my own eyes. It was raining. And Truman's the new president. Harry S. Truman. Who is this Truman, heshele? I don't know, but, um, he looks Jewish. A Jewish president we are not going to get in my lifetime. Can I have two Loose Lucky Strikes for my mother? Dumbbell, President Roosevelt is dead. So what? My mother wants two Loose Luckys. Here, boychick. You should be crying. You're not crying. I am. I am. Zeda, I'm crying. I am. Here, heshele. Drink your egg cream. As we were saying, the cabinet in the White House vows to settle all details of public importance. There probably will be an immediate swearing-in ceremony. (LAUGHING) I really want to meet your mom. That would kill her. Take the limo back to the hotel. I'll take a taxi. You should find a younger man, Francoise. That's what my father says. Shh. (WOMEN CHATTERING) Excuse me, I'm looking for Mrs. Stone. Oh, Yetta? She'll be down in a minute. She's taking her daily walk right about now. What shape is she in? She's a tough cookie. Got more energy than I do. I'd appreciate it if you'd keep an eye on her. I'm her son. (ELEVATOR DINGS) Uh, we have a no-tipping policy. It's not a tip. It's a reminder. What's going on around here, heshele? You're looking good, Yetta. I see you already met Kareem. He's a Celtics fan, would you believe that? The Celtics are a great team. I hate the Celtics. You look tired. Come on, we'll go for a walk. What happened, you got taller? BOTH: (CHUCKLE) (MEN CHATTERING) HARRY: When are you gonna quit smoking? Yetta: Why should I quit smoking now? Anyway, they're mentholated. (PEOPLE CHATTERING) So, how's the picture? It stinks. You mean, it's worse than the last one? I kind of like Paradise Jack. Ah, too much undressing. Too much talking. And that girl, she looked like she was starving to death. They're all thin now, mom. That's the style. You know what you've got? You've got a beautiful granddaughter. Molly? She's a princess. I gave Carrie $1,000. I don't know, they're always broke. How you doing? How should I be doing? I, uh... I eat three-and-a-half meals a day. I have my books, I gamble a little, I look at the tube, And my famous son comes to see me once every 10 years. I saw you last Christmas, mom. MAN: (GREETING IN RUSSIAN) Yetta: (REPLIES IN RUSSIAN) They all think I'm Russian. Well, you are Russian. No, my parents were Russian. Me, like Bruce Springsteen says, "I was born in the USA." Do you need anything? Yeah. I need a youth transplant. Take me back to 35. I promise, I'll, I'll jog every day. (SIGHS) Is the picture really so terrible? I sold out, mom. Now wait a minute. Tell me, what is it about? It's about a group of farm boys in the midwest who grow a giant cucumber and fly it into outer space. Harold, what did you have, a lobotomy? What, what happened to your idea about Anna Karenina? You mean the remake? Yeah. That's a beautiful story. It was a great idea. I wanted to switch it to today. Make Anna the wife of a rich industrialist, like a Rockefeller. And she falls in love with this younger man, but she just can't leave the husband. And it still ends tragically. She throws herself in front of a train. Maybe the subway. But I don't know who to get for Anna. What about uh, Deborah, uh, Winger? Debra Winger. Yeah, Debra Winger. That girl's got a lot of pizzazz. But I couldn't get the money. Come on. Let's go back, Harold. I'm tired. That makes two of us, Mom. Harold, come on. What... What's the matter? I've got no right to complain, mom. I'm all ears. (SIGHS) I feel old, I'm tired, (LAUGHING) And I'm scared. Join the crowd. You take a number, you stand in line. You're afraid of dying, I'm afraid of living. They're the same thing. Come to France and live with me, mom. You're on such a guilt trip. (CHUCKLES) You're right every time. I love you, mom. I hate those pants. Why don't you dress your age? (LAUGHS) (CHILDREN SQUEALING) YOUNG Yetta: What do you mean? I don't understand. Why did I marry you? You're crazy, Yetta. I was crazy to marry you. Let me enjoy the ride! Drop dead! Go to hell! What has four wheels and flies? You go to hell! A garbage truck. I am in hell. That's my problem. (LAUGHING) A garbage truck. Did you hear that, Bernie? A garbage truck. What? What? What has four wheels and flies? (LAUGHS) A garbage truck! A garbage truck! That's good! Right. I used to live around here. Hey, it's beautiful. It's worse than Moscow. It was a real neighborhood. Everybody knew everybody. We were poor, but it was safe. It's a war zone, Mister. Here. Stop here. No, I don't like it, Mister. Just five minutes. (MUSIC PLAYING ON STEREO) ** Play for the thrill, for the critics come for battle ** Got to be invincible, college confessable ** I'm packed as hell, this is what I'm telling you ** I compromise, I'm constantly upsizing ** Competition in the crowd didn't listen to the lyric ** You come to tear down the building? I used to live in this building. You the law? No, no. I just came to see my old neighborhood. We lived in the back. My grandparents lived right there in the front. Hi. MAN: Must have been a long time ago. Over 30 years. It was pretty nice then. Well, it's shit now. (ALL CHUCKLING) You folks seem pretty nice. Hey, baby. I am nice. (ALL LAUGHING) And you wanna move back? I don't have the guts. I told you he's the law. I'm a movie director. My name is Harry Stone. I go to the movies twice a week. I never heard of Harry Stone. Oliver Stone. I want to be a stuntwoman. My brother's in a video. He can rap. Shit, put me in a movie. Hey, uh, what movie you doing now? I just finished a picture called The Pickle. (ALL LAUGHING) (WOMAN LAUGHING) What's this pickle about? Well, it's about a group of farm kids who fly a giant cucumber to another planet. And the crazy thing is the planet they arrive on looks just like Earth. HARRY: In fact, it looks just like the Upper East Side. And all of the people on this planet are trendy. They wear only spandex, and they love cows. (ALL EXCLAIMING) (WOOSHING) It's a bird! It's a plane! It's a pickle. (PICKLE JUICE PLOPPING) (WOMAN EXCLAIMS) (ALL EXCLAIMING) (SQUEAKING) (ALL EXCLAIM) (GASPS) Look, we have The Times interview... Oh, my God, in 10 minutes. This is such a great break for us. Who's doing the interview? Yakimoto Yakimura. A Japanese? She's very intelligent, Harry. A Japanese broad? She's screened all your pictures just for this one interview. People are curious about you, Harry. But the critics are gonna kill me. The cheeseburgers are fabulous. Hi, I'm Francoise, Harry's girl. Hi, I'm, I'm Nancy Osborne. I'm the publicist. Oh, no. Well, we have to get room service up here right away, to take away some of these carts. It's a mess. The whole room is a mess. Ah, I just can't believe it. Okay. I could use a salami on rye, and a lot of nuts with cream soda. Maybe the Jap wants some sushi. Who's the Jap? Uh, it's Yakimoto Yakimura. Yeah, hi, yeah, this is, um, it's, uh, room 619, yeah. I need a salami on rye, I need a cream soda, and, uh, two coffees. And there's a lot of carts up here that need to be taken away. So could you hurry? FRANCOISE: Nancy, I, I want some, uh, ice cream and chocolate sauce. How do you say it? NANCY: Yeah, a hot fudge sundae? Yeah, thank you. NANCY: Yeah, could you add to that a hot fudge sundae with vanilla ice cream, and please hurry. Thank you. Bye. (HANGS UP PHONE) Francoise, turn off the T.V. Go in the other room. You're getting on my nerves. You cannot treat me like a baby. (PHONE RINGING) Hello? Oh, yes, send her right on up, please. Yeah. Thank you. It's Yakimoto. Harry, I want to meet her. I never met a Japanese, uh, journalist. Get in the other room now. No, no, no, it's okay, Harry. Yakimoto's very nice. She can meet her. No, I don't want her to meet her. I want her to get on a plane and go back to Paris. FRANCOISE: (SPEAKING FRENCH) NANCY: Whoa, whoa, whoa! You wanna play dirty? Go home to your mother! You're cold, just like the fruit of pickle! You're selfish! Oh, no. What are you doing? (DOORBELL RINGS) I hate you! Get back! No, no, no, no. Oh. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) Hi, Nancy. Hi. Oh. Is this a bad time? No, no, come on in. Uh, hi. Hi. Yakimoto Yakimura, this is Harry Stone. Well, hi, hi. Hello. It's like a... It's like a scene from a movie. (CHUCKLES) Oh, have you ever done a screwball comedy? I, uh, I thought you're not a critic. (CHUCKLES) I'm not. Just a writer. (DOORBELL RINGING) I made a couple of visits to Japan. I liked it. Everybody's uptight. I'm from Syracuse, New York. Do you mind if I use a tape recorder? Whatever you want. Do you want to eat first? Mmm-mmm. Ask away. (SIGHS) Why'd you move to France? Salami on rye? Yeah, that's for Mr. Stone. And the, uh, cream soda? I got the soda. Yeah, now, I'll take care of it, thank you. Yaki, can I get you some coffee? Uh, yeah, sure. Uh, black, no sugar. Okay. Oh. Why'd I move to France? Yes. What about the, uh, hot fudge sundae? I'll take care of it. Come and get your ice cream. I moved to France because I was tired of New York, and I refused to live in L.A. Besides, why do you need a reason to move to a beautiful place? France is gorgeous. Seriously gorgeous. But you're an American. Mmm-hmm. Francoise, where are you going? Home. Come here. No! Sit down, have your hot fudge sundae. No, you cannot treat me like a piece of shit! I'm sorry. I apologize. I'm, I'm nervous about the movie, and I, I guess I'm taking it out on you. Come on. You wanna sign for this now, please? Sit down with Harry. Come on. Sit in my lap, come on. HARRY: Where's the hot fudge? NANCY: Yeah, there you are. Here. Here. Have a bite. Is it good? Hmm. HARRY: Have a bite. (LAUGHS) Where were we? Uh, "France is seriously gorgeous." I'm from Paris. Francoise Tournier. Yakimoto Yakimura. Hi. Hello. I got fed up with the New York bullshit. And I couldn't take the swimming pool scene. That's not hard to figure out, is it? Here. I, uh, I really like that picture, the Blue Dust. Thank you, amigo. (CHUCKLES) What do you know? He saw Blue Dust. Are you here to stay, Mr. Stone? Harry. Harry. Here to live, you mean? Yeah. No, I have no future plans. If anything, I'm contemplating suicide. (CHUCKLES) He's joking. No, he's not. He's very anxious about The Pickle. Shut up, Francoise. Would you call The Pickle a comedy? No, believe me, it's a tragedy. This dentist should go to jail for life. Phil, Phil, meet Yakimoto Yakimura. This is my agent, Phil Hirsch. Oh, hello. I'd better come back later, Harry. Maybe I should come back later. Hello, Francoise. Oh, no, no, continue the interview, please. (CHUCKLES) Your films are sort of like this scene in the hotel room, Harry. Is that good or bad? I told you, I'm not a critic. So, what's next? Well, I don't know what I'm gonna do next. I know what I should have done. NANCY: Harry. No, I, I don't care if they print it. I should have done Cortes and Montezuma. Cortes and Montezuma. I wanted Dustin Hoffman and Warren Beatty. Hoffman as Cortes, Beatty as Montezuma. An amazing story. Cortes: Arrogant, cruel, chivalrous. Montezuma: Painfully superstitious, can't make a right move. It's a wonderful tale. I want to meet Warren Beatty. You're too old for Warren Beatty. I'm only 22. (PHONE RINGS) No, I got it. Hello? Yes, he is. Just a minute, please. Harry? Hmm. For you. It's your son. My son? Yeah. Gregory, where the hell are you? GREGORY: (OVER PHONE) I'm downstairs. Are you okay? I'm fine. You sure? I'm sure. Can I come up? Okay, come right up. He flew in from L.A. He's okay? We'll soon find out. The drugs? He's clean. He's A.A. for a whole year now. Uh, maybe we can finish this tomorrow, Mr. Stone. NANCY: Oh, good idea. Oh, sure, uh, come by for lunch. You're having lunch with Ronnie Liebowitz and Mike Krakower. Well, how about breakfast? Uh, fine. 9:00? No, make it 11:00. And nothing personal about my son in your piece. (DOORBELL RINGS) Excuse me. You look older, Harry. But then again, so do I. (GRUNTS) Hi, Uncle Phil! Long time no see. You look like you got a toothache. Or, uh, or is that me? And this... This must be Francoise. Hi, I'm Gregory, and I just flew in on the transglobal airlines' $99 special. No frills, and also no engine. You must be the publicist. You look worried. I assure you, I'm fine. Or is it The Pickle you're worried about? (CHUCKLES) And you. You're either the Japanese exhibitor, or you're writing my father's next film. I'm Yakimoto Yakimura. Of course. I loved your piece on Sigourney Weaver in The Times. And you did something terrific on Billy Wilder. And I do not use that term loosely. Well, thank you. Uh, see you at 11:00, Harry? Yeah. What are you on, Gregory? You are absolutely gorgeous. Relax, Harry. It's not a pass. You're on something and I don't like it. Time to go. See you tomorrow. Bye, Phil. Good to see you. Oh, Francoise, bye-bye. Bye. It was very nice to meet you. Bye. Bye. Bye. I was right. That was the publicist, wasn't it? Swear to me you're clean. I swear to you, I'm clean. I'm clean a year this Christmas, pop. I'm writing a movie that's what I want to talk to you about. And I wanna see The Pickle, and mom, and Carrie, Grandma Yetta, and the baby. The baby is beautiful. Adorable. Let's take a walk, pop. GREGORY: It's a murder mystery. It all takes place in Laurel Canyon. The detective walks in a house, picks up a cat. He says, "I wish the hell you could talk." So the cat's the only witness to the crime. The cat looks him straight in the eye and he says, "Look in the bathroom under the sink." What do you mean, "the cat says"? It's a talking cat. It's funny. It's ridiculous. Can I see one of the new blood pressure kits, please? They just came in. They are great. Just a minute. You just made a movie about a flying pickle. No one is gonna buy a script about a talking cat. Ronnie Liebowitz is. Ronnie Liebowitz, the head of the studio? He loves it. How did you meet him? All you have to do... I told him I was your son. Is insert your left forefinger in the hole. I told him I had an idea. There we are. He told me to come in. He liked it. Okay. Are you pissed? Hold the unit right next to your heart and press the red button. Now press the other button. (BEEPS) And we get your blood pressure. He'll probably ask me to direct it. I hope so. No way. I will not direct a movie about a talking cat. Okay. If my life depended on it. If I had my back to the wall, on my ass, dead broke, no way will I direct a movie about a talking cat. What if the baby's life depended on it? That's not fair. Who said anything about fair? Gregory, I'm happy if you sell the script, but I have a career. I've a record of work I'm proud of till now. And I love your movies, pop. But they're only movies, they're not life and death. Oh, yes, they are! A man's work is life and death! (MACHINE BEEPING) I think you should take it again. What is it? What's the number? Well, you were so agitated. What are the numbers? 180 over 102. I'm a dead man. No, no, no, please. Sit down, sit down for five minutes and take it again, Mr. Stone. Sit down. It'll go way down. You'll see. How do you know my name is Stone? I'm one of your biggest fans. You know, I love Paradise Jack, no matter what those critics said. So, please, one more time. Right next to your heart, press the two buttons. Just take a nice, deep breath. You know, they say you can control your blood pressure with your mind. It's all in the mind, pop. (PHONE RINGING) My wise-guy son. I sold one yesterday to Woody Alen. What was his pressure? I'm afraid that's confidential, Mr. Stone. (MACHINE BEEPING) Please. Please. 150 over 96. That's a considerable drop, huh? You should've been a doctor. Does that mean I've made a sale, Mr. Stone? Wrap it up. Thank you. And good luck with The Pickle tomorrow. (CAR HONKING) PATTI: (SINGING) ** Just leave me alone ** I've got those Monday blues ** Straight through Sunday blues ** Good morning, heartache ** Here we go again ** Good morning, heartache ** You're the one who knew me when ** Might as well get used to you ** Hangin' around ** Good morning, heartache ** Sit down ** (AUDIENCE APPLAUDS) (PEOPLE CHEERING) If I told you once, boychick, I told you a thousand times. Never sit at a table with your back to the door. (PEOPLE CHATTERING) Patti Wong, Francoise Tournier. You're wonderful. (IN FRENCH) Thank you very much. But, Gregory, you're huge. As is my wont. Why we should not sit with our backs to the door? The enemy can attack and by the time you turn around, it's too late. Old Chinese proverb. Ah, you believe this, Harry? He doesn't. That's why we got divorced. (CHUCKLES) You look pasty, Harry. What means "pasty"? Shitty. Again. Yeah, and I'll have a coke, straight up, mmm. He's in A.A. So am I. I wish Harry would join. Hey, you're hitting it pretty hard, pop. That's my business. Go write another cat movie. I'm sorry. Now I'm jealous of my son. FRANCOISE: How long Harry and you were married? About a year-and-a-half. Harry taught me about art, literature, architecture. He showed me Europe. Then I became a coke freak. How long you been clean? Two years. I'm clean a year. Dull, isn't it? (PIANO PLAYING) I'm due back, Harry. Remember those Chinese herbs I used to feed you? Get back on them. Lose some weight. Stop boozing. And for God's sake, stop worrying about The Pickle. Oh, and some good news. You can forget my alimony payments, starting next month. I married the piano player. Teach me about life, Harry. She's really great. All my mothers are talented. ** Why does it seem so inviting? ** Autumn in New York PATTI: ** Autumn in New York BOTH: ** It spells the thrill of first-nighting (FRANCOISE SUSHING) HARRY: ** Glittering crowds ** And shimmering clouds ** Glittering crowds Come on, pop. It's time to go. ** And shimmering clouds ** In canyons of steel PATTI: ** In canyons of steel ** They're making me feel ** I'm home PATTI: ** They're making me feel ** It's autumn in New York ** It's good to live it again PATTI: ** I'm home ** It's not funny. You made a fool out of yourself. HARRY: Baby, I want to make the beast with two backs. No, I don't make love with an alcoholic. Oh, let me put my pickle inside of you, cherie. You're disgusting! Oh, where are you when I need you? Oh, you want it? Take it! Take it! Some guys like thighs, but I'm a breast man. (GROANING) (GRUNTING) Show me your pickle! Show me your pickle! Show me! Show me your pickle! Show me! You're breaking my zipper. I break more than the zipper. HARRY: (LAUGHING) Stop it. (GASPS) (BOTH LAUGHING) You don't have anything there. You don't even have a pickle. (BOTH LAUGHING) (GASPING) Oh, don't make the joke, Harry. (WHEEZING) I can't breathe. Call the house doctor. (PANTING) I sold out. Uh, help. I sold out. (SOBBING) I need help, please. Pickle killed me. I need a house doctor. Hurry. I can't breathe. 619. Help. And please hurry. (WHEEZING) I can't... I can't... (PANTING) Don't die, Harry. You know I love you. Water. Water. (STAMMERING) You need the waiter? No. Water. Agua. Eau. Oh, water? I'm gonna get you some water. Get me water. Water. Water. Water. YOUNG HARRY: You know, if you even have a sip of water, then you broke your fast. YOUNG BUTCH: The last water I had was just before sundown. You sure, Butch? Sure I'm sure. What about saliva? What if you drink your own saliva? I think saliva is permitted. How do you know? Because it makes sense, that's how I know. Prove it. And besides, you don't drink your saliva. You swallow it. What if you spit your own saliva into a glass and then drink it? Then you'd be a schmuck, like you are. Up yours with gauze. Up thine with twine. Hey, fellas, no cursing in front of the synagogue. Especially on Yom Kippur. (PEOPLE CHATTERING) Grandma, grandma, grandma. Grandma, I didn't eat all day, grandma. Oh, you're a good boy, heshele. Not even a drop of water. (DOORBELL RINGS) (SIGHS) I'm the doctor. Oh, he's, he's right in here. Hello, I'm Dr. Spalding. Hi. Uh, you got any pain? Yeah, right in the chest. Uh-huh. Um, what, what's it like, the pain? It's, it's a... It's a burning sensation, right in here. How about your left arm? Any pain there? No, that's fine. Can you move your fingers? Yeah. Okay. Can we get you up on the bed? Here, help me. Let us do most of the lifting here. Just gonna sit you right up here. That's it. Good. (GROANS) Is this, is this where it hurt? You got it, doc. (SIGHS) You're, uh, you're Harry Stone, aren't you? Yeah. How long have I got, doc? I've seen some of your movies. Very entertaining. Am I a dead man? Have you had a lot to drink tonight? Ah, he's drunk. What did you have to eat? I had a salami on rye and a cream soda for lunch. And a cheeseburger with french fries for supper. Plus, a lot of nuts. I love nuts. Why don't you open your shirt for me? Just unbutton it. Heart's okay. Pressure's a little high. I think you've got acute indigestion. Jesus, my fly is open. Francoise, cover yourself. Take two of these for your stomach. One of these should put you to sleep. And also, I'm gonna write a prescription on those. But you should see a doctor tomorrow. Get a complete checkup. It's that bad, huh? You've got to get some rest, Mr. Stone. (STAMMERING) I don't have a doctor. Well, I'll leave the name of a good internist with the concierge. Thank you, doc. Uh, how do I pay you? It'll be on the hotel bill. And, uh, good luck with The Pickle. Thank you, doctor. (SIGHING) (GROANING) You cannot abuse your body much longer. Francoise, listen to me. You're a delicious young woman. You're bright, you're funny, and you're loving. I treated you like shit all day long. I'm too old for you. Go home and have a good life. I'm 104 years old. Don't be silly. I beg of you, please. Don't be here in the morning. And I know it's corny, But you'll thank me for it someday. Why did I ever eat that salami on rye? Good night, kid. Good night. ANNOUNCER ON T.V.: You could enjoy some of New York's most famous restaurants and meeting places. The extraordinary palm court, with its feeling of an elegant indoor garden, offers a full menu and the pleasures of piano and violin ensembles. (COWS MOOING ON T.V.) MOLLY-GIRL: We discovered the harmfulness of red meat, sir. So, Mr. President, we became vegetarians. We've brought you samples of every vegetable known to man on Earth, so you can plant them in your fields and you can save Cleveland. (LAUGHING) Please excuse our, our president's laugher. It's hardly your fault that your information is so outdated. But if you scratch a Clevelandian, you're gonna get this kind of bottom-line honesty. PRESIDENT: The point is, Molly-girl, that we only eat meat on Cleveland. Have some candy. (COW MOOING) Thank you. This tastes like chopped liver. It is. It's a heart attack planet. Not at all. We don't have arthritis, bursitis, or rheumatism. Our hair never turns white. How do you do that? We die at 49. But that's terrible. How old do you think I am? (COW MOOING) Well, you look very good, sir. 48-and-a-half. Then you'll be dead in 6 months. Molly-girl, don't be sad. Be glad. Don't be mad and feel like you've been had. (MUSIC PLAYING) ** Good golly, Miss Molly ** You sure like to ball ** Good golly, Miss Molly ** You sure like to ball (HOOTS) ** When you're rocking and a-rolling ** Can't hear your mama call ** Good golly, Miss Molly ** You sure like to ball ** When you're rocking and a-rolling, can't hear your mama call ** (PHONE RINGING) (WOMEN CHATTERING) (PEOPLE CHATTERING) (CAR HONKING) Can I help you, sir? Mrs. Stone, Ellen Stone. Is she expecting you? I'm her husband. She's not married. She used to be. To me. Mr. Stone. Long time no see. I'll call and see if she's in. (DOORMAN) Uh, Mrs. Stone? Harry Stone down here to see you. Okay, thank you. 14G, Mr. Stone. Aren't you gonna wish me luck with The Pickle? "The Pickle"? What's "The Pickle"? Thank God for New York doormen. (DOORBELL RINGS) ELLEN: I'm coming. I'm coming. Hold on a second! All right! What is the matter? I wanna get married. So get married. To you. Oh. I'm on my way out. Ellen, I love you. I love you. Yeah, right. I've always loved you. I've never stopped loving you. Harry, are you having a nervous breakdown? What's the matter with you? I'm getting too old to be chasing around with kids. Oh, Harry, what are you doing? You're the only one who ever understood me. Harry, I am the only one who would ever take all your ego games, now stop this. There'll be no more crap, I swear. Harry, stop this. I do not want you to do this. Come to bed with me. I don't want to go to bed with you, Harry... I just want you to stop this. Come to bed with me. No! Or I'll throw myself out the window. You don't have the guts. Now stop this, right now! Then I'm gonna jump. So jump. Harry, just remember, you are afraid of heights. Goodbye, Ellen! We'll see if I have the guts. How did I put up with him all these years? Harry, what are you doing? I have an appointment at the gym. Why are you doing this to me? Because I can't live without you. Yeah, well, you've managed for quite a while. I had a mid-life crisis. (SIREN WAILING) Then what the hell is this? This is life or death. (CAR HONKING) (PIGEON COOING) Yes or no? No! I'm gonna jump! Harry, get in here right now! Get in here, Harry. Now! Will you marry me? No! I'm gonna jump! Harry, I'll go to bed with you! (POLICE SIREN WAILING) ELLEN: Easy, Harry. Harry, Harry, easy. Easy. Harry! Harry! Oh, God, what you do to me. You always do this to me. I don't believe you. And you get me. I'm crazy about you. I'm crazy about you. See, you do that kind of stuff and you get me. I love you. That's what I don't understand. But I love you. I love you. You make me fall for it. There's never a day I don't think of you. Yeah! I want you. Really? Oh, yeah. I swear. I love you. You love me. I wanna make love to you. You do? Oh, yeah. Yeah. Gently. I don't wanna be an animal. I love animals, Harry. Oh, yeah. I love animals. Can I touch you? Can I touch you? You're just saying all this because you just wanna make love to me, right? Yeah. No. Are you sure, Harry? I swear. It feels so good. Oh, it feels good, Harry. The way I feel... Talk to me, Harry. I love your lips. Tell me. Did I ever tell you about your lips? Tell me, Harry. They drive me crazy. Harry... Oh. Oh, Harry. I love it when you put... Just remember! What? This is a mercy fuck. Today, senores, we have a beautiful Norwegian salmon, we have a delightful mahi-mahi, a very tasty orange roughy. RONNIE: I'll have a salmon, grilled, no butter, three lemon wedges on the side and a mixed green salad, no dressing. Some vegetables with the fish? Oh, all right. Throw in some steamed broccoli. What I wouldn't give for a cheeseburger. Do you have a nice potato? Certainly, sir. Baked, boiled, or fried? Baked. Baked, no butter, no sour cream. JOSE: Some margarine? No! Just the potato. Hey, Mike, why are you trying to lose weight? I just got a new valve put in. A heart valve? No, they put a valve up his ass. Don't they do valve jobs in France, Harry? Are you okay now, Mike? I feel like a million bucks. I'll have some borscht. JOSE: And for your entree? Just the borscht. My teeth are killing me. What will it be for you, Mr. Stone? Some fried eggs over hard, hash browns, whole-wheat toast, and some onion on the side. Oh, that's suicide, if you don't mind me saying so. Now, that's what I had the morning I had the attack. Fried eggs over hard. I love fried eggs over hard. Well, this may be my last meal. I'm sorry, Mr. Stone. This is a no-smoking section. Thank God. Better off on devil's island. Uh, some wine with your lunch, gentlemen? Oh, are you kidding? These boys want straight Evian. And lots of it. (PEOPLE CHATTERING) Well, a toast to The Pickle. What are we gonna toast with? Doesn't matter what we toast with. It's the sentiment that counts. I think it's gonna be a huge hit. What did I tell you? (EXCLAIMS) I think you hit a nerve. Waiter, get me a scotch. Yeah, make that two. Johnnie Walker Black. Oh, shit. You know, I wouldn't mind having a drink myself. I would like a very dry martini. Beefeater with a twist of lemon. Anything for you, sir? Just the potato and as fast as you can, please. I'm very, very hungry. You know, I have to agree with Ronnie about The Pickle. Our research polls show very high interest in the film. How can there be high interest if they haven't seen the goddamn thing? We give them a card with the plot on it and ask them what they think of it. And they wanna see it, Harry. Mike, how much did we score? 86 percent wanna see. Which is unbelievable. E.T. didn't score that high. Admit it, Ronnie, you're scared shitless. The Pickle is a giant turkey. Harry, if there's one thing I know, it's that nobody knows anything in this business. I believe, I believe in The Pickle. It's a loser. Harry, our research is on the money. We question people in malls. Waiter. Excuse me, waiter, can I talk to you for a moment, please? Hi, how are you? What is your name? Jose. Jose Martinez, senor. Jose Martinez. What a lovely name. Jose, do you like to go to the movies? Oh, yes. In fact, I've seen a lot of movies Mr. Stone made. Oh, isn't that wonderful? Isn't that wonderful, Harry? Would you like to see Mr. Stone's latest picture? Sure thing. I would love to, sir. Tell him what it's about. It's about a bunch of farm kids from Kansas, and they fly a giant cucumber into outer space. Any pretty girls? Any good action scenes? (LAUGHING) You see? He hates it. Could you please hurry with that potato? Harry, be in my family, please. I wanna make more pictures with you. Ronnie, I don't wanna make any more pictures. What about Cortes and Montezuma? Oh, Cortes and Montezuma? Oh, I love that already. You know, I, I've been to most of the ruins in Mexico. They are utterly unbelievable. Yucatan is so heaven. It's not a travelogue. It's a tragedy about these two great men. How Cortes was able to destroy Montezuma and the Aztecs with only a few men. They thought he was a God. Shit. Why am I wasting my time? Well, do we get to see the sacrifices and the violence? And that, that love story between that nice Indian woman who loves Cortes? Uh, what is her name? I, I've forgotten the name. Malinche. Or Marina, as they called her. How old would you play Cortes? He was 34 when they invaded Mexico. Oh, that sounds like Dustin, or Jack. Yeah, yeah. No, they're in... They're in their 50s. Oh, please, Dustin looks terrific. I had dinner with him last night. I think he'd be perfect for Cortes. Perfect. Perfect for Montezuma, too. He'd sure as hell open the picture up big. He wants $6 million. RONNIE: $8 million. $6 Million was two years ago. Tell me, who do you see as Montezuma? Oh, my potato. How about if we get an unknown for Montezuma? I would love that. It could be exciting, Harry. You're great at finding new people. So, when can I read this material? Whenever you want. Is everything satisfactory, gentlemen? Oh, hi, Jose. Could you bring me another martini? Another scotch, amigo? Sure thing, Mr. Stone. I like that Cortes story. (CHUCKLES) Harry, I got a really crazy idea. Well, shoot, Ronnie baby. Let's update it. Update what? Update Cortes. Let's make it east L.A., today. Hmm? The barrio? Cortes is a Chicano cop called in to clean up the Aztecs, the Aztecas. Hmm? The Aztecas are a really tough, really tough street gang. And the leader is... Montezuma. And Montezuma has a girlfriend named Marina who Cortes falls in love with. I love that. I love it. It is a great commercial idea, and you still use Dustin as Cortes. Sean Penn as Montezuma? And Meryl Streep as Marina. And you wouldn't have to do any building. You'd shoot the whole thing in east L.A. No. Streep, no. Forget it. Not good for the girl. What about Madonna? That's terrific, Phil. Oh, yeah. That's terr-- Great. Sean and Madonna. Sean and Madonna, together again. No way! No way I will make an updated version of one of the most beautiful stories in history. Let's forget it. Harry. This is insanity! Harry, come on now. Just relax. Just relax. It's an idea, a concept. Forget it, goodbye. That's it. It's over. No. No, no, I'm not gonna forget it. HARRY: okay, folks? Folks? Excuse me, (STAMMERING) let's take a vote. All those in favor of, of Cortes and Montezuma, raise your hands. Now all those who prefer the updated version... AIDE: I'm crazy about you. MOLLY-GIRL: (PANTING) But you hardly know me. I've just never met anybody like you before. No, don't. We always do it on the first date in Cleveland. Because you die so young? Exactly. But it seems so empty. It's just sex for the sake of sex. Don't you ever feel guilty? We don't have any guilt in Cleveland. We just love just for the sake of loving. Do you believe in God? (LAUGHS) Of course we do, you sweet thing. This is our Bible. It's on video? AIDE: Now, in the beginning, there were the heavens, and there was the sky above and the land below. and there were the oceans, and the lakes, and the rivers, and the streams. (PLAYING INSTRUMENT) And all this... All this God did on the very first day. (SIGHING) It's different. Well, God was in a hurry, darling. AIDE: So God created all the animals on the second day. And on the third day, God created Adam and Eve. And man was just poisoned with desire. Cleveland was destroyed. And God, realizing his... His terrible mistake, decided to create Adam and Eve all over again. Adam and Eve knew they would never taste the fruit of desire. They would only eat, eat the meat. PRESIDENT: If you want your own copy of the Cleveland Bible, call 1-800-BIBLE. I repeat. If you want your own copy of the Cleveland Bible, call 1-800-BIBLE. If you want your own copy of the Cleveland Bible, call 1-800-BIBLE. You can stop now. BUTCH: (OVER P.A. SYSTEM) okay, Mr. Stone. Thank you. You're welcome, heshie. Do I know you? BUTCH: I was in your class in P.S. 179. Butch. Butch Levine. Butch, I'm coming back. Hey, Butch? Heshie. (LAUGHING) How are you? How are you? Oh, I can't complain. I know how you are. You're doing great all these years. Would you... Would you recognize me? I don't know. You look pretty good. I'll be 60, come next March. You're in April, right? What a memory. You ever see any of the guys? Pinnie, Marty, Louie the Italian? Oh, no. I, I drove by the old neighborhood yesterday. It's pretty sad. Looks like a war zone. Yeah. How's your mother? She's okay. She's, uh, living in Brighton Beach. Uh-huh. Your father passed away, didn't he? You know my whole story, don't you? You're a famous man, heshie. Or should I call you Harry? I feel like I'm 10 years old when you call me heshie. Ah, it goes like a bullet, doesn't it? Well, anyhow, I'm still married to the same woman. I gottwo grown sons, and a beautiful daughter, and five grandchildren. And come next summer, I'm packing it in and moving to Florida. You're retiring? I don't care if I never see another movie. Except yours, of course. I've seen all your movies, Harry. That's heshie. You made some beauties. What do you think of this one? Well, I only saw the one reel. It's a turkey, isn't it? (EXCLAIMS) Science fiction's not my cup of tea. (CHUCKLES) You're not a good liar, Butch. You never can tell, the kids might love it. Hey, Butch, remember the rabbi's daughter? What was her name? Uh, Naomi. She had black hair. And purple eyes. And you were crazy about her. I kissed her once. (CHUCKLES) In the doorway of the rabbi's building. I thought I'd go to hell for sure. My God, she was beautiful. Who'd she end up marrying? I don't know. She never became famous. Well, good luck, hesh. Um... If you wanna have a drink, Give me a call. I'm at the plaza. Make some more good movies. (PROJECTOR WHIRRING) (OPERATIC MUSIC PLAYING) A voice like gold. Listen, Harold. It's beautiful, mom. It's a gift from the gods. Listen. Oh, listen to this note. (SNORING) Listen, Bernie! Listen! I'm listening. I'm listening. Can you believe a human being can make such a sound? I'm getting goose bumps. Are you getting goose bumps, Bernie? I'm getting hungry. That's what I'm getting. Shh. Let me listen in peace. Hmm. Mom. Mom. What, Harold? What's the matter? You look like you saw a ghost. I got... I got goose bumps. Man alive, I got the biggest set of goose bumps you ever saw. And never forget it, Harold. That's what a human being can make you feel. (LAUGHING) Here's your sleeping pills and your gauloise. And that'll be $17.95. Well, thank you very much. No bag. Good luck with The Pickle tonight, Mr. Stone. (PEOPLE CHATTERING) FRANCOISE: Harry! Harry! Hey, kid. I thought you went back to Paris? No. I'm not gonna go back to Paris that easy. Buy me a drink. We'll have one upstairs. Oh, you never take me anywhere. Buy me a drink. You look so beautiful. Okay. Okay, okay, I'll buy you a drink. Let's go upstairs. Harry. You're not too old for me. (ELEVATOR DINGS) I'm getting younger by the minute. ALL: Surprise! ALL: Surprise! ELLEN: We got you, Harry! ALL: Surprise! Surprise! Surprise! Surprise! Surprise! Surprise! (ALL CHEERING) MAN: Surprise! Surprise, Harry. We're here to wish you well. We got a winner. I smell it big. I know you hate these things, pop, but I had to do it. It was all Gregory's idea. He came for me in a limousine. It looked like a hearse. (ALL LAUGHING) We love you, Harry. Molly sends a big kiss. I'm Ellen, your ex-wife. Me, too. Congratulations, Harry. I'm David, your son-in-law. Are you okay, Harry? Oh, I wish we'd had a photographer. ELLEN: Yeah, me, too. YETTA: Oh, Harry, cut the cake already. ALL: Cut the cake! Go for it. ALL: (SINGING) ** For he's a jolly good fellow ** For he's a jolly good fellow ** For he's a jolly good fellow ** Mom. A toast to The Pickle. ELLEN: That's a good idea. (ALL EXCLAIMING) PATTI: Make a speech. (ALL CHATTERING) ALL: (CHANTING) Speech. Speech. Speech. (WOMAN CHUCKLES) Um, thank you all for coming. I really would rather say something after the movie, though. I know you all love me, but it's, uh, it's bad luck to get cocky. And besides, isn't it getting late? Oh, we have to go right now. We have to get down to the theater. Oh, we better be moving out. Come, come, chop, chop. It's gonna be terrific. What's the matter, you're not coming? No, I never go to my own previews. We'll bring the cards up to the room when it's over. I am so excited. I can't even breathe. See you later, Harry. All right, I love you, pop. Love you, kid. Okay. Bye, boychick. Good luck, papa. Harry? It's gonna be great. Okay. I'm gonna laugh a lot. (PEOPLE CHATTERING) Maybe. Are you okay? You okay? Yeah, I couldn't be better. Good luck. Testing, one, two. Testing, one, two, three. Testing. Hello, this is Harry Stone. Today, I am a man. (TAPE REWINDING) HARRY: (ON TAPE) Testing, one, two. Testing, one, two, three. Testing. Hello, this is Harry Stone. Today, I am a man. Dear friends and beloved relatives. That sounds stupid. (SIGHS) This message is for all of you, good friends and relatives. I was surprised to see you all here today. It's almost like you knew what I was gonna do and you came to say goodbye. I thought I was gonna have to lie again. But, no. You came to give me your love, which you all have done forever. And what have I given back? (DOORBELL RINGS) What? MAID: Chambermaid. Would you like your bed turned down? No, thanks. MAID: You want your chocolates? No. Now, where was I? Yeah. What have I given back? A lot of self-pity. (PHONE RINGING) Yeah? WOMAN: (OVER PHONE) Mr. Stone, you have some flowers. I don't want any flowers. Shall I send them up later? Yes, send them up in an hour. Make it, make it two hours. Yes, sir. Mom, Carrie, Gregory... I love you all. But I realized today, I'll never change. I'll always be a pain in the ass, and I'm tired of it. Ellen. Ellen, I can only apologize for today. I'm just an animal. I wish you a long and happy life. And, mom, you're a prince of a mother. I'm sorry I haven't been there for you. (SIREN WAILING) Carrie, Gregory, I love you both. (PEOPLE CHATTERING) (SIGHS) Gregory, you're gonna have a great career. Keep the balance I didn't have. Love your work, but don't love yourself too much. Mom, did I say goodbye to you? And, Patti... (CHUCKLES) We had some fun. Francoise, promise me you'll go right back to Paris. Get a good guy your own age, or maybe a little older. But please stay away from directors. You're a great girl. Hold it. I got an idea. Uh... (LAUGHING) I'll take my pressure as I kiss off. Take away the pressure. (LAUGHING) No more pressure. (LAUGHING) Who needs pressure? Molly. Did grandpa say goodbye? I had a girlfriend named Molly. I was 16 years old. Molly was a popular name in those days. Molly Goldberg, Molly Picon, Molly McGuire. I had an Aunt Molly and an Uncle Morris. Actually, she was my great-aunt and he was my great-uncle. Morris was a cantor. What a voice. A tenor. Could have sung opera. A "cantor" is a singer, Molly. He sings for his supper. And one fine day, Uncle Morris sang at my grandfather's funeral. My zeda's funeral. (SINGING IN HEBREW) (SOBBING) Oh, my father! My father! Oh, God! My God! Control yourself, please, Yetta. I loved him so much. We all loved him. Goodbye, zeda. You're a good boy, heshele. (PHONE RINGING) Yeah? BUTCH: Heshele? Yeah. It's Butch. What? It's me, Butch. You okay? You sound weird. I was taking a nap. You'd better wake up, hesh. You got a hit on your hands. We're on the last few minutes and they love it. Love it? I gotta go, hesh. (DIAL TONE BUZZING) (RETCHING) They're coming to the last scene in The Pickle. I love you, Molly-girl. I love you, too. You know that. Then stay here with me. I can't. I just can't. Oh, Molly-girl. I can't... I can't spend the rest of my life eating meat. As much as I love you, the thought makes me nauseous. You'll get used to it. Please don't make this any harder for me. CLEM: Let's go, Molly-girl! Molly-girl, we have luminescence! Maybe we can find some way to... To grow sprouts, and... Soy beans, and avocado. God, if only you could. We could have such a good life here in Cleveland. I'm only 36. I've got 13 good years ahead of me. I'll never forget you. (COW MOOING) And thanks for the cow. Goodbye, Molly-girl. (CREAKING) (CROWD SIGHING) (SHUTTLE ENGINE ROARING) (WHISTLE BLOWS) (PEOPLE CHATTERING) MAN: It was a wonderful film. Hello, baby. My beautiful filmmaker. Come here. It's a monster hit! It's a monster hit! 95 percent domestic, for sure. I loved it, Harry. Thanks for the money, Harry. Congratulations, dad! I can't wait to have the cassette, Mr. Stone. It's like Fellini crossed with the Marx Brothers. I'm not a critic, but we loved it. It wasn't so bad. I laughed a lot. Thanks. You got a winner, hesh. Thanks, Butch. Butch! I think Time magazine will give us a cover. What a movie, Mr. Stone. HARRY: Thanks, amigo. Harry, you're too young for me. I loved your pickle, Harry. It was very touching. Even my teeth don't hurt. You stop smoking, Harry. Yes. Come with me, far from the madding crowd. So, can we talk about your next picture? I got this idea when I was taking a nap. Oh, Cortes and Montezuma... No, no, forget, forget Cortes. Cortes can wait. It's a timeless story. I wanna do something about now. Oh, I love now. Yeah, I wanna do a story about a father and son. The father's been living in Brazil, but he comes back to New York and he goes back to his old neighborhood. I wanna shoot it in Brownsville, on location, in black-and-white. RONNIE: I love black-and-white. Citizen Kane was in black-and-white. The Third Man was in black-and-white. The Ox-Bow Incident, 8½, The Bicycle Thief, La Strada, they were all in black-and-white.
