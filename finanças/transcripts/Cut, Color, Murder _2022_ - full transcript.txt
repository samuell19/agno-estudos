Help me up, please. What, what the heck are you doing coming through the window? You scared us. I forgot my house keys at the salon and I didn't want to wake you guys up. Oh yeah, that worked out well. It's 2:30 in the morning. What are you doing? Well, I was on a date and had the most fabulous time. We danced and we laughed and we drank and then... he dropped me off. It's like I'm living with two teenagers. Was he cute? (whispers) Very. ♪ ♪ Hey. Good morning. Hi. Wow. You are a bottomless pit. She eats when she's stressed. Why are you stressing? I got my next tuition payment. It's due. I've already told you, the offer still stands, honey. I appreciate that but I won't take your money. I want to do this on my own. It's my choice. Well, that's why you're working at the salon. You know if you want extra cash you can help Beth with pedicures. I've seen some of those women's feet. I'd rather drop out. (chuckles) How was last night? Well, unlike you I was home at a reasonable hour. Oh boy. What happened this time? He talked with his mouth full of food. I spent the whole night just ducking chunks of trout. (laughs) No, it's not funny. I'm just through dating. I'm just not ready. Please don't set me up anymore, okay? Please. I mean it. Okay, sweetie. You know what? We gotta go. - Wait, no, no, no. Un-huh. - What? Ali, I made all this food. You weren't ready. I know, thank you. But the salon's going to be a madhouse. We have to go to work. Ali! (Ali mumbling) so good! She's not going to eat it. Eric: When they work, right? (Rachel laughs) Yeah. What advice would you give a first-time contestant? Oh, well I would say that when you're taking your victory lap, try not to fall on your booty. (laughs) - Really Rachel? - It was funny. - You bring that up every year. - It's funny. - And Beth? - What's funny? You were in diapers when that happened. I've seen it on YouTube a bunch of times. 'Cause it was a thing of beauty. It was sabotage. Heels don't break in half. Somebody cut them off. You want advice on the pageant, trust no one. - Ooh. - Especially you. (laughs) Morning. Good morning Detective Crawford. Fred Wright, police chief. Take a load off. Okay. Yeah. You've come at a good time, new guy. We're just in the middle of a real humdinger. Larceny. Let's see what we got. Stolen scooter? That's your big case? It's not just any scooter. It's Mabel Boyer's scooter. She's a real spitfire. I'm sure she is. But I'm used to working... You have nice hair. Thanks. Thank you so much. What's Mitzi really like? Is it true she has favorites? Well, all I can say is that she's always been good to me. If she hadn't told everyone in town that I was the best hairdresser I'd be out of business. It's not like she needs a freebie, though. She practically owns the whole town. And she runs the pageant like a drill sergeant. - Mmhmm. - Right. Mitzi told my sister she walks the runway like a Sasquatch. Okay, maybe she's a little overcritical sometimes. No, the woman is evil. Like with horns and tail. Oh, what a magnificent day. - Hello Mitzi. - Good to see you, Carol. There she is. My very favorite Miss Golden Peak. How are you, darling? Just trying to survive. Oh, tell me about it. I've got 1001 things to do in preparation for the pageant and there are never enough hours in the day. Well, you're going to get it all done. You always do. And somehow every year is better than the last. So, the usual? Ali. Your 3:00 is here. Hey, Sterling. I, I'm running a little bit behind. You don't mind waiting a bit? Well, don't make him wait too long. I mean, a handsome man like this? You don't want him to spoil. Okay. I got it from here Mom. Thanks. This is for you. Oh! Or the salon. It's from my greenhouse. Your flowers are always amazing. Thank you. I make my own compost. That's the secret. (clears throat pointedly) Hello Sterling. Mitzi. Have you given any more thought to my oak tree issue? Because if it really is against every moral fiber in your body, I respect that. But then I am going to have to have Wally Simons take over my landscaping. He's not attached to every single tree. I'd like to discuss this with you in a more private setting. Of course, dear. Let's. (phone rings) (groans) Excuse... Can you Pardon me? It's Darren. I have to take this. Well, you're in luck. So, what is going on? You are out of sorts today. How could you tell? Well, every time you're stressed out you lean left on my chair. Oh. Uh, just business stuff. Don't want to bother you with it. Can I ask you a direct question? Sure. How come you won't ever go out with me? I mean, do I smell bad? I do handle fertilizer daily. No. It's, it's nothing personal. No, you're, you're handsome, you're sweet, you're kind. Wow, this Sterling fella sounds pretty perfect. (laughs) But come on. One drink. Well, is it a date? Definitely not. A date would involve eating food. All right. Well just one drink. (doorbell jingles) (claps loudly) (gasps) Hey everybody. I have some big news. Okay, listen up. Stop what you're doing. People, you're looking at the brand new weather man of "Hello Boise." (cheering) Wow! Congrats! That's incredible. And who knows where it's going to go from there? New York, Los Angeles, Chitown? And we will say we knew you when. And it's time for your appointment, superstar. Okay. Come on down. (clears throat) All right, Sterling. You are all done. Great. I'll call you. Okay. Olivia: You are unbelievable! Do you think I know what you did. Sara: I'm sure I don't know what... Okay, you have to go break that up. - What? - Please go break that up. - No wonder Mitzi despises you. - Are you kidding me? All right. Neutral corners, ladies. I caught her spying in my car window at the dress my Connor is going to wear for the pageant. Oh, I was just making sure you hadn't stolen Liza's dress the way you stole mine 20 years ago! I did no such thing! Ugh! But while we're on the subject of stealing, you stole my dance routine. What? I lost the crown because of you. Oh no, honey! You lost the crown because of you! (whistles) This is unacceptable behavior from any of my girls, past or present. Need I remind you of the Miss Golden Peak mantra? All: Grace, dignity and strength. Sorry Mitzi. Everyone knows that Liza is the favorite to win this year. You told me that yourself. And I am not going to let her do to my daughter what she did to me. Take that back! No! My Connor is the favorite. Mitzi told me so. Didn't you, Mitzi? I think both girls are capable of winning. Chelsea Bowden, is that you? Oh, my goodness you used to be a little street urchin and look at you now. Please tell me that you're entering the pageant. Me? All: Her? Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Not me. Oh honey, you are so pretty. In an unconventional way. I, actually, think that there might be a third horse in this race. Oh, I am just bored with this. Let's do something drastic. Something exciting. All right. Let's play. Mm. - You have to do it. - Come on. You have the GPA. I'm not the pageant type. It's just a bit too antiquated for me. The parading women around like show ponies. It's just... Oh, no disrespect, Ali. No, no, no. But it does open doors for women to a lot of opportunities. Think of all the charities I've been able to help because I was Miss Golden Peak. And you're going to look fabulous because I'm doing your makeup. Right? And I'll be doing your hair. And I've got your nails covered. See? And the $25,000 grand prize could help pay for school. Come on... (chanting) Chelsea! Chelsea! Chelsea! All: Chelsea! Chelsea! Chelsea! Chelsea! I'll do it. (cheering) That's my girl. How about a toast, huh? - Yes! - To the next Miss Golden Peak. - To Miss Golden Peak. - Yes. - Hello ladies and Eric. - Hello Fred. I'd like to introduce you to Kyle Crawford. He's our new detective. Just arrived from Columbus, Ohio. And as I ease into retirement you're going to see a lot more of him around town. Thanks for the warm welcome, Fred. I want you to know that I intend to not only protect this great community but become a part of it. All hands on deck. That's my philosophy. Okay, okay, that'll do, thanks. Actually, while I have you here Ali, can I borrow you for a sec? I have some questions relating to some sideburn issues that I have. Sure. Fred. We know this little routine. Do not get involved, okay? Remind me again why we're using a hairstylist to solve crime? Well, the whole town passes through Ali's salon at one time or another and she keeps her ear to the ground. Our usual please. I'll have a harpoon. So, let me guess. This is about Mabel Boyer's stolen scooter? - It is. - Thank you. Cheers. So, Fred tells me you're quite the amateur detective. (laughs) Well, I guess I'm good at reading people. Oh yeah? What are you reading about me right now? I'd guess from the fancy shoes that you're getting by with more than what Fred is paying you. Sorry Fred. No hint of Midwest accent, so you're originally not from Ohio. Your Georgetown tie tells me that your family's from the east coast. That's pretty good. I'm from- Massachusetts. Not a lot of people know about Harpoon beer unless you're from Massachusetts. Arnold who owns the place is from Worcester but I'll bet you grew up near the water because of your sailing background. How'd you know I like to sail? You said "all hands on deck" earlier. - It's an old sailor saying. - Right. You're also unmarried, more than likely single. Well, that's easy. I'm not wearing a ring. Oh, neither did my husband. His joints would swell up. It's the feather brow wax. Excellent work by the way. If there's one thing you learn running a salon, is that married men usually don't wax their eyebrows. But you know who does? Single men. (laughs) How about that? Feathered eyebrows. (chuckles) You heard anything about Mabel's scooter? Oh well, you have to ask (a) who would want a Vespa Festoon with gardenias, (and b) who would risk ticking off Mabel? No one I can think of. She's a holy terror, especially on the road. Exactly. I'd check in on Janine, Mabel's daughter. She's been saying her mom's too old to be playing Easy Rider on the streets of Golden Peak. That would also explain why the three locks left on scene were opened, not cut. There you go. Now, if you'll excuse me I do have to get back to the table. Nice hair. Wow. Like the tide. Don't try to understand it, just respect it. Yeah. ♪ ♪ I cracked another case for Fred yesterday. Mabel Boyer's missing scooter. Do you remember her? Ah. It's been two years and I know that you said that you would've wanted me to find someone if something happened, but... (sighs) You set a pretty high bar. Anyway, I finally said yes to Sterling for one drink. We agreed it's not a date though. Oh, and you're never going to believe this. But Chelsea is entering the Miss Golden Peak pageant. (laughs) Chelsea! I knew you'd get a kick out of that. I love you and I miss you, honey. ♪ ♪ Woah, what a mess. You must be Mitzi Stewart. And you are? Kyle Crawford. Golden Peak PD. Wow. Um, where's Fred? I think he said he's at hot yoga. What exactly happened here? Well, I'm not a trained professional like yourself. But my best guess would be a break-in. Exactly how new are you? Anything specific missing? Well, it's impossible to tell. I didn't want to touch anything. Any idea who would've done this? It's pageant season and there's no telling how far a parent might go to get the upper hand. Can I leave you to this? I have a pageant to run. (to himself) Each girl is special. Beauty is both unique and fleeting. Good morning ladies. You need more blush. And I absolutely adore your hair. Though that color is so last year. Where is...? What? This is ridiculous. It's unacceptable. You've been here three hour Stan! You said that the room would be ready this morning. Okay, I can't have this kind of racket going on while we rehearse. What can I tell you? Your local crews are slow. Or maybe it's your big time talent that's waning. I mean, it has been 12 years since you directed Salesman off Broadway. It was on Broadway, princess. I don't like excuses. How could you? Hannah James? She's a brilliant caterer. Yeah. For the prison system maybe. I've been your caterer for 20 years and not a single complaint. Why am I sharing this job with her now? Competition brings out the best in people, Arnold. Or haven't you noticed? Mitzi, I can't afford to split this job. It gets me through the year. I don't like oats in my hushpuppies. Quinoa is a grain. I was trying to be healthy. Chelsea Bowden. I have seen mules walk with more grace. Eric, could you excuse me? I need to speak to Liza for a minute. Oh, yeah. Today. Thank you. Hi Mrs. Stewart. I'm so excited. Well, I'm very sorry, because you're not going to be able to participate in the pageant. What? Well, it's come to my attention that you're holding a GPA of 3.4999 and you know you must have a 3.5 or higher in order to compete. I'm very sorry. But you can try again next year. Oh honey, I'm sorry. That took so long. What's the matter? (tearfully) Mitzi disqualified me. Someone told her about my GPA. (sobbing) Oh, honey. Okay, listen up everyone. We are starting with the walkthrough in 60 seconds. So let's get to our marks. Let's go. (sobs) Where's my host?! Darren? I'm here. All right. Let's get ready. Five, four, three, two, one. Hello and welcome to the Miss Golden Peak Pageant. Cut! What? What is it? You girls, you're supposed to walk to the front of the stage. Uh no, they're supposed to line up behind me so that when I walk by I can introduce them. I'm the director. That's how we've been doing it for the last 15 years. Mitzi! Someone find me Mitzi!

What do you know about that? I know he was one of your detectives. The best. Sorry, Fred. Hey, she's wearing a vitality ring. What's that? For monitoring sleep patterns. It also tracks heart rate variability, respiratory rate and body temperature. You think that thing could establish a time of death? It's possible. I'll check into it. Can you think of anyone who had a reason to kill Mitzi Stewart? I can think of one or two. ♪ ♪ (sighs) You were having an argument involving Mitzi right around the time she was discovered. So what? Is arguing a crime now? Mitzi and I had creative differences. Had you been in to see Mitzi in her office before the walkthrough started? No. I ran to my car quickly. I left my throat spray on the front seat of my car and I knew I needed it. If I was you I'd keep my eye on Darren. Darren was driving Mitzi crazy for the past week. They were having some issues. Darren and Mitzi were best friends. Everyone knows that. Mitzi was my closest friend. She meant everything to me. That's not what she told me. (whispering) Can I speak to Rachel? Oh. Oh, that's me. Can you take me to your station? Yeah, okay. Sure. Right here. Excuse me. Thank you. How many pairs of shears do you own? Oh lots. (laughs weakly) But I only bring two pairs along when we work outside of the salon. Can you show me? Yeah, sure. Okay. There's only one pair here. Do you share them with anyone? Are you kidding? People use my shears, they die. Okay, not good wording. Um, people know not to mess with my stuff. I even have my name engraved on every single pair so there's no confusion. One of the mothers said that you don't like Mitzi very much. Called her evil the other day at the salon. Oh. What's going on? Am I a suspect? Don't go anywhere. I may have a few more questions for you. Yeah okay. (sighs) You listen to everyone here, you'd think Mitzi was a regular Mother Teresa. Yeah, well, people get nervous around a dead body. How you doing? This must be dredging up old feelings for you. It must be hard. Well, for either of us. Yeah. But I'm okay. Thank you, Fred. You see anything suspicious? Fred, can I speak to you? Shouldn't we be treating everyone like a suspect? Well, Ali's family. I'm just, I'm worried about information leaking out. You don't need to worry about her. Fred: Ali knows the importance of discretion. Still can't believe it. And they haven't cancelled the pageant? Not yet. They cancelled all of today's activities until they figure out what to do. I must have seen her just 10 minutes before she died. It's scary. There's a murderer running around our town. Yeah. It's probably somebody we all know. This must be really hard on you, Hannah. Didn't she just hire you? She did. I was beyond excited for the opportunity. It would've given my business a lot of exposure. Arnold Jackson was beyond livid. Yeah. I've been hearing that he's got money issues now. I've known him a few years now and he's always been really kind, even at cooking competitions. But he was raging. I overheard him going on about "that tyrant Mitzi" and something about her needing a lesson in humility. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ Dan? I'm back here. Dan? Dan! Oh Dan, Dan, Dan. Oh Dan, talk to me. Who did this to you? Talk to me! (gunshot) (gasps) - Good evening, Mrs. Bowden. - Hello Sterling. Sterling: These are for you. Ali: Would you put these in water for me. Come home whenever. (laughs) Well, thanks for bringing her flowers. Oh yeah, no problem. Yeah. Here. Oh um... Oh, sorry. Um, thought I put that in the back. I'll grab it. Sterling's Weed Remedy? Yeah. It's my weed killer. I blend it myself without using toxic chemicals. You know, things you can find in your kitchen. Um, white vinegar, lemon juice, salt, dishwashing soap. Works like a charm. I don't use anything that isn't organic. Well, that's very environmentally friendly of you. Well, ah... ♪ ♪ You ask a lot of questions. Well, I guess, I'm just um, a naturally curious person. Well, I wouldn't say I'm militant about my activism. But I did live in the top of a tree for two weeks when they were trying to cut down an oak grove at my college. Two weeks in a tree? I guess that story does make me sound a tad militant. No, just passionate about oaks. Hi Ali. Hey, how you holding up? Honestly, I'm not doing too well. Even my new job in Boise is bittersweet. At least I managed to convince the committee to allow the pageant to continue with added security. It was everything to Mitzi. She'd have wanted the show to go on. Sorry to bother you. I need a drink. Have a nice night. You too. Poor guy. Even though I had my differences with Mitzi, it is sad. And talk about ironic. Miss Pageant Queen herself dying at the end of stylist shears? Where did you hear they were shears? I didn't think they released that information. Oh, probably heard it around town. (phone rings) Oh, um. I'm so sorry. Hey Fred. Actually, it's Detective Crawford. Oh. I think you should come down to the station. Your sister's already here and I've been trying to get ahold of your mother. ♪ ♪ What's going on? I'm getting frantic texts from my mom saying that Chelsea's going to be here for hours? Why do you need to see her? Didn't you already get a statement? We did and a little more, actually. Ken ran the prints on the murder weapon. They match your sister's. What, you're not insinuating Chelsea has anything to do with this? Her prints are probably on every pair of scissors in the salon. She's in charge of cleaning them. We're just following procedure. If we didn't interview someone with a possible motive then we would... Motive? Some of the girls saw Mitzi embarrass Chelsea. Said she was pretty upset. And you call that a motive? Where did you get your badge, out of a happy meal? Ali, you gotta know I don't believe Chelsea's involved in any of this. But Kyle is right about the procedure. There is a real murderer out there and you guys are wasting your time. We simply just want to ask you a few questions about Chelsea's state of mind while Ken gets a few DNA samples. DNA? Mitzi's body probably has the whole pageant's DNA on it. It's called secondary transfer. Right. But in the detective's defense, he's only trying to follow procedure. Procedure. Got it. But you do know it's personal now. Mom. Sweetheart. Hi. Are you okay? Yeah. I'm, I'm fine but I'm hungry. Fred? You should be ashamed of yourself. I really don't think I can forgive you for this. Come on. - Carol, hold on a second. - I'll see you later (speaking Spanish) Come on, let's get out of here, honey. Ali, I'm sure you already know this, but your sister needs to stay close until the investigation is complete. Fred. You should take the shovel out of this guy's hands because he is digging himself an awfully deep hole. Did I just stick my nose in a beehive? More like murder hornets. It's only been a few hours and everyone's staring at me like I'm a murderer. It seems the other contestants are all over social media. You know what, honey? Ignore them. I didn't kill Mitzi. No, we know you didn't. That's not the question. But your fingerprints are on the murder weapon. I never touched those shears after I cleaned and packed them for Rachel to take to the club. Just like I did all the others. Look, I'm going to get this all straightened out. But if you want to pull out of the pageant, it's okay. Honey? Do you? I can't. It'll just give the girls something more to talk about. And I'm not a quitter. You sure? Just be careful then, okay. I will. I'm going to go use the restroom. Meet you in the car? Sure. Sara: Things happen for a reason. And the reason Liza and that awful Mitzi are out of the way is so you can win. (door opens) Ali. Hi. Hi Sara. Hi Connor. So terrible what happened to Mitzi, isn't it? Horrible. She was such a sweet woman. It was good seeing you. I can't tell you enough. Mitzi and I had a strong working relationship. She was good to me. Hey guys. - Oh! Oh! - Agh, ow. I, I am, I am so sorry. Why don't I believe you? Don't tell me you have more than one suspect for a murder investigation? I'm not a suspect. Am I? I'm just doing my job. Following up on all leads. Hmm. (phone rings) - Enjoy the rest of your day. - Enjoy the rest of your coffee. (phone continues to ring) Ken, what do you got for me? Ken: The results came back from the vitality ring. And? Her heart rate stopped at 4:33 PM. You got your time of death. Nice. Hey. How you doing? You okay? Leave it to Mitzi Stewart to be a thorn in my side even after she's dead. I thought you and Mitzi got along. Look, I catered the pageant ever since Mitzi took over. And the first few years they were great. Then she started nickel-and-diming me, knowing full well that I needed the work. Then why would Mitzi bring Hannah James in? For her own amusement. I swear to god that woman got a kick out of pitting people against one another and constantly threatening to replace me if I didn't take a pay cut. Business just isn't what it used to be. And I needed pageant weekend to get me through the year financially. Without it there's no more Jackson. ♪ ♪ That new detective came to my house last night to question me again. He's a Pit Bull with gorgeous hair and beautiful blue eyes. I hope they find the person who did it soon. I don't want to be studying for my college finals in a prison cell next year. I just want you to know that I'll come visit you every weekend. Really? Every other weekend. I like to sleep in on Sundays. Stop it. Nobody's going to visit anybody in prison. Okay. Fred will figure this out. Now get back to work. Okay. Oh, speaking of the devil. Good afternoon, Carol. Do not get Ali involved. I don't want her doing your work for you anymore. Yes, ma'am. I know you all aren't too happy with me. I don't want to lose an earlobe. You're safe. It's your new detective I have an issue with. So, you heard anything I'd be interested in? Well, I think Arnold Jackson has a pretty good motive. Financial ruin. I'd say that's as good a reason as any. I also overheard an odd conversation between Sara Hendricks and her daughter, Connor. Might want to revisit them. I'll do that. Anyone else you're looking at? I think it's best you let Kyle and me handle this. Besides your mom would have my hide if she knew I discussed the case with you. I wonder if the town would be interested to know that I was the one responsible for cracking the stolen car ring. Are you blackmailing me? Or the time that I cracked the Sunday brunch burglar. You know, when the town finds out they might elect me police chief. Oh, okay, okay. All right. So, there's Stan Evans, the director of the pageant. And Olivia and Lisa Stevens, neither are very pleased to be disqualified. Any clues I should be aware of? There's a small blemish on Mitzi's dress as well as a single white hair that Ken is evaluating. We also found two pay stubs in Mitzi's purse made out to an Andrew Rockwell and a Sharon Helton. Both for $1,500. Either name ring a bell? No, not off the top of my head. What about the camera footage from the club? That'll come in later today. We also established the time of death at approximately 4:33 PM. I probably said too much. Fred, all I ask is that you let me see the security footage. Now that there's a time of death it could clear Chelsea. I'll handle it. You have to stay on the sidelines. And if you're out there snooping around I can't know about it. You got it. Girls, I know you're all hurting. But we're going to make this year's pageant the best ever, because we're doing it for Mitzi. Places everyone. I know what you've been up to. What are... what are you talking about? You're seeing someone else. I haven't seen you for a haircut in over a month. I meant to, but with this pageant I haven't had a moment to myself. And with Mitzi's death, I'll be happy when it's over and I can go home. Hello Miss Reed. Glad to see that Chelsea's still participating in the pageant. Yes, well she's never been a quitter. Runs in the family. I can see that. Would you excuse us? I need to speak to Stan. Sure. It's all going to turn out okay. And you just call me when you want that haircut, okay? Okay. He's all yours. What's this about? I already told Fred everything I know. I just have one question. As long as you answer it honestly, you can get back to work. I have nothing to hide. Where were you at the time of Mitzi's murder? 4:33 PM. I was outside taking my rabbit for a walk. He was with me that day because I had to pick him up at the vet's office before I came here. You were walking a rabbit? I'm telling you the truth. Look, if you don't believe me then all you have to do is go speak to Doctor Stevens. She's the vet. Now no, hey, no. Girls! Girls! Wait, wait, wait! You're supposed to exit stage left! Your other left! Excuse me. I have a show to direct. I just want to express my gratitude for all of the hard work you're doing to find Mitzi's killer. I'd like to offer my services in any way that I can. - Thank you, Darren. - Mm. Oh, one thing Darren. Where were you at the time of the murder? - Me? - Yeah. I told Fred already. I had to get to my car to get my throat spray. I'm sorry, I gotta put out a trash fire. Stan! (Stan arguing in the distance) (knocking) Ali. What are you doing here? I brought you some barbecue. Oh, you didn't have to, but glad you did. I also brought you this. I got it off Stan Evans' shirt earlier today. Ali, I asked you to stay out of this. Good work. I'll get that to Ken. So, what's keeping you here so late? The security footage came in 20 minutes ago. And I wanted to get a look at it before I went home. But I could use a break. (chuckles) Oh, oh, oh! Mmm. I'm gonna get a drink. You want one? - Oh no, thank you.

There's Arnold Jackson and Hannah James. And there's that angry director Stan and Darren. Mm. Oh, here comes Mitzi. It's so macabre watching her like this and she has no idea that in a few minutes her life is going to be over. Oh, there's Olivia and Liza Stevens. Okay. Well, all our suspects are accounted for. Let's see where they are exactly 4:33. Whoever's present we just cross off our list. Ha! There's my sister. You are no longer a suspect. Oh, yes. Good honey.

We never finished our drink. - Got you a beer. - Oh. So, how's everything going? Just trying to process Mitzi's murder. Seems that everybody that was at the club that day is a suspect. Even me if you can believe it. Yeah, the whole situation is scary. How could something like this happen in our little town? It's happened before. Right. Sorry about that. No, it's okay. Well, I'm glad I wasn't there. At the club, I mean. You want a beer? I need another one. Sterling, are you aware that there are security cameras at the club? I, um... No, I, I didn't know. I saw you on the footage. You were there. How did you see the tape? That's not important. What's important is that you're honest with me. Um, that's right. Yes, I was there for a minute. But only briefly. And what were you doing there? I stopped by to see if I could persuade Mitzi not to cut the oak down, and to save my job. Okay. And how'd that go? I couldn't find her so I left. Like I said it was all very quick. Anyone else besides you see the security tape? Well, I'm sure Fred has a copy. Right. It's loud in here, isn't it? You want to go somewhere more quiet? (nervously) I like it here. We can go to a table in the corner if you like. Hi Sterling, Ali. Mind if I join you two? - Actually, we were just... - It'll only take a second. You know, I should be going. Sorry, Sterling. Uh... So... Could you tell me what you were doing at the Stewart Country Club the day of the murder? I... I want to talk to a lawyer. ♪ ♪ (doorbell jingles) Oh, Beth. Thank you so much for offering to do this free pedicure for me. I could totally use the pampering. Free? I'm not sure... Yeah no, Beth, remember when you told me you want to do something really nice for Olivia after what happened with Liza? So sweet. Will you excuse me for just one second? I just, I wanted to say how sorry I am for you and Liza. It's a shame what happened. Thank you. And Liza is devastated. We put three years of preparation into this pageant. It's, it's heartbreaking. Hmm. We've moved on, so. Well here, take a seat. Thank you. I just can't imagine how you must have felt when Mitzi told you that Liza couldn't compete. You must have been furious with Mitzi. Oh, well, Mitzi was who she was. To be honest, I have a bigger problem with the person who tipped Mitzi off. Did she tell you who it was? She didn't need to. It was Sara Hendricks. She knew that my Liza was a favorite to win this pageant. So she had to get her out of the race. Oh. Anyway, I'm so excited about my pedicure. Thank you. - Of course. Enjoy. - Mmhmm. ♪ ♪ Hey you. So, how's Connor doing? Amazing. She's a star that girl. Hmm. She was born for this. Oh, she really does look so confident. I was the opposite. I said some of the dumbest things in my interviews. I remember Mitzi telling me I was prettier with my mouth shut. She almost made me cry. Mitzi really had a way with words. Oh, you seemed to get along with her. Everyone knew that if Mitzi liked you you had a better chance of winning. So, I faked it. I sort of hated that woman. Oh, I didn't know that. She knew that Olivia and I disliked one another way back when we were in pageants. And she did her best to stoke that dislike even more. And now she was using our daughters to keep the feud going. Hmm. It was sick. But you were the one who told Mitzi that Liza didn't have a 3.5 GPA. Of course it was me. All is fair in love, war, and pageants. Well, as a friend I'd keep that to myself. The police might think you had reason to kill Mitzi. (scoffs) I couldn't care less. I was nowhere near that office when she was killed. Oh, that's good. So where were you? In the kitchen getting some water. Oh. Well, good luck. Thank you. But luck is for losers. (laughs uncomfortably) Oh. Come to put the shackles on my sister? Hello Ali. How's Chelsea? Oh, she's holding her own. You know, I was just following the rules. Well, of course. No, it's the right thing to do. I'm not a bad guy, contrary to what you might think. To be honest, I don't give you much thought. - Really. - Hmm. Well, if we're being honest I don't give you much thought either. Oh, great. - Great. - Great. - Have a nice day. - Nice day, I know. Stan: Let's go, next group. Let's move, let's go. Tick tock, tick tock. Time is of the essence. There we go, there we go. Hey Stan. Come on, really? You're going to interrupt me in the middle of my... If you'd rather answer my questions at the station I'd be happy to give you a lift. What do you want? Do the names Sharon Helton and Andrew Rockwell mean anything to you? They were on a couple pay stubs at the crime scene. I don't recognize those names but Darren would probably know more. He's on the pageant committee. I'm just a hired gun. Now, can I get back to work? One last thing. Refresh me. How would you describe your relationship with Mitzi? Strictly professional. Time! As you can see it's going to be nothing but sunshine in the heart of Idaho. So, if you're planning on going outside don't forget your sunscreen and your sunglasses. And we're out. Ali! Hey Darren. This is a nice surprise. What are you doing here? Well, I've never seen you work before. This is so interesting. Ah, this is small potatoes. You should come and see me in Boise. It's like walking onto a movie set. Oh, they are going to love you out there. Hey, I was wondering. Do you know a Sharon Helton or an Andrew Rockwell? Yes, yes, I do. They worked for the pageant. Oh. Not for too long, maybe a few weeks at the most. I didn't know them all too well. Young kids, boyfriend and girlfriend if I do recall. Why do you ask? Do you think they had something to do with Mitzi's murder? Well, two pay stubs with their names on it were found in Mitzi's purse. I mean, could be absolutely nothing but I'd definitely like to talk to them. Do you know where I can find them? Honestly, I don't. They uh, were just hired to do some odds and ends and one day they up and left. Oh. Well okay. Well, thanks Darren. I look forward to seeing you opening night. Yeah, I'm pulling for Chelsea. Ooh, I can't really say that, can I? Mmm... (laughs) Ok. Let's go. Great work. (phone rings) Ali. What's happening? So, Darren claims Sharon Helton and Andrew Rockwell worked for the pageant. I'm going to go search the social media platforms. Okay. We also got some interesting news back in from Ken. Oh. What did he say? Fred: The stain on Mitzi's dress. It's a combination of lemon juice, salt, vinegar and soap. I don't know what that's all about but I'm working on it. I think I know. I'll talk to you soon. This must be my lucky day. I was just driving by and thought I saw you. It's me all right. You haven't returned my calls. Not that I can blame you. Having that detective show up in the middle of our date... drink, kind of put a damper on things. Yeah well it's, it's fine. Everyone's being questioned. I'd love to make it up to you if I can. I have a small cabin in the woods half an hour from here. It's got an amazing wildflower garden. I'd love to show it to you. Well, it's all crazed at the salon now and with the whirlwind around Mitzi, it just, it's, it's all a bit much. You don't think I had anything to do with Mitzi's murder, do you? Of course not, no. But, listen... I, I'm kind of late. I'll see you soon. You're a brave guy coming to see me after what you've done. How about we call a truce with each other? We both want to catch Mitzi's killer, hmm? Tell me what you know. Please? Well, you know, that stain found on Mitzi's dress? How do you know about that? Do you want my help or not? Yeah. Please go on. Well, the ingredients match a homemade weed killer that Sterling Addison makes himself. That's a pretty big piece of information. He said that he was at the country club but he never saw... Mitzi that morning. Yes, I know. But this would suggest that he's lying. Okay. What else you got? Sharon Helton, Andrew Rockwell. A couple ghosts. I ran their names through a database, checked social media, nothing. Well, some people don't have social media presence. Like you for instance. How do you know that? Are you cyberstalking me, Detective? Just doing my job. What else you got? Well, I wouldn't fall asleep on Sara Hendricks. She's a true pageant mom, and a pageant mom is capable of anything. Noted. What about Stan Evans? What do you know about him? A New Yorker. Habitually grumpy and combative. But that's not a motive to kill anyone. What if he was the jilted lover? Stan and Mitzi? We got Mitzi's emails and texts back from Ken. Turns out they were hot and heavy till a couple weeks ago. Mitzi ended it. Stan got pretty heated. Mitzi threatened to fire him from the pageant. Well, I never saw that coming. Does he have an alibi? He was walking his rabbit. (laughs) Okay. According to Olivia Stevens the vet, he picked up the rabbit from her office the morning of the murder. Well, if I hear of anything else, I'll let you know. You're all done. Huh. Well, not bad. What do I owe you? Well, it's usually 30, but for you, 50. You barely cut it. Why are you gouging me? You just said my haircut was "not bad." I don't do "not bad." 50. (laughs) - Thank you. - Thank you. Anytime. ♪ ♪ I'm not nervous at all. I can do this. I can totally do this. This is yours to lose.

I was hesitant to enter. But I have an incredible role model at home. My sister, Ali. A former Miss Golden Peak. Ali is successful. She's independent, and she's generous. She cares for this community, for all of you. So, you ask why I want to wear the crown? Because I hope to be all that my sister is. Thank you. Wow! (applause) ♪ ♪ Running like a well-oiled machine. I'm sorry Mitzi isn't here to see it all. Me too. You know she never appreciated anything I did for the pageant. Never once gave me an ounce of credit. Well, I guess, that happens sometimes in relationships. One person takes the other for granted. I know about you and Mitzi, and the police do also. I'm sure you'll hear from them shortly. Why did you lie about it? Mitzi wanted it that way. She was very private. We'd been together a year and I wanted it to be normal. Wanted it to be out in the open. And when I voiced that, she ended it. I didn't kill Mitzi. I loved her. I'm sorry. (bell dings) I, I appreciate it. Please, excuse me. Okay, that's a five-minute warning. Let's move it.

You have my word. ♪ ♪ I'm sorry, but we're just totally booked today. Tonight's the big night. How are you feeling? Unstoppable. Connor has nailed every competition so far. Soon she will be wearing the Miss Golden Peak crown. Right Con? Whatever you say, mum. Well, it's good to have confidence but there are four other girls left. Yes, and one of them is our very own. Let's be real. It's a miracle I made it this far. Connor, you're such a natural on stage. How do you make it seem so easy? Con, don't answer her. Nothing against you Chelsea but you're the competition. As long as the pageant is on, Connor has no friends. Well, that's a little harsh, isn't it? Do you know what second place is? The first loser. Oh. That's one way of looking at it. You're all done. Good luck tonight. - Thank you. - Stand up straight. - Thank you. - Thanks. Wow. Guys. I heard the police held Sterling overnight for questioning. What do we all think? Did he do it? No. No way that guy killed Mitzi. He's too nice or something. Yeah. I agree with Rachel. That guy just does not seem like the killer type. But Stan on the other hand, that guy is nastier than a rattlesnake. It's true. Hello everybody. - Hey. - Oh hey. I didn't know you were in the books today. Yeah, your mom snuck me in. I just need a little neck cleanup for tonight. Oh, well come on over. I got you covered. I heard someone tried to kill you.

Can I see that photo for a minute? - Sure. - Thank you. ♪ ♪ I'm aware he came up negative on the gunpowder test but I still think he's our guy. I'm not so sure. Well, he's got motive. We can place him at the scene of the crime. His weed killer is on her dress and that means there was some kind of physical contact made. And he lied to us. True. But my gut still says no. None of our other suspects have a plausible alibi for their whereabouts at 4:33 PM. But in my experience there's three reasons people kill. Money, power, and love. Sterling's motive didn't have any of those. But you know whose did? - Stan Evans. - Stan Evans. (knocking) Hey guys. We got the results back from the lab from the hair that was found on Mitzi. And the hair that Ali plucked from Stan Evans. - We got a match. - Oh. Rabbit hair. (chuckles) Hey. What are you working on? I'm trying to write the opening speech for tonight. I want to pay tribute to Mitzi. Something special that folks will remember. I need to ask you something. Now Ali, you of all people should know that I can't give you inside information on which way the judges are leaning. You'll just have to wait. No, no, that's not my question. Have you ever forged Mitzi's signature before? On say, a check? What? No, of course not. I want you to take a look at the handwriting on these check stubs and tell me what you think. Now the police can send this to a handwriting expert and get their opinion. Fine. I signed a few checks for her. I'm on the pageant committee, I pay the vendors. But that doesn't make me a killer. Sharon Helton and Andrew Rockwell aren't vendors. They don't exist, do they? Now my guess is that you were skimming from the pageant, Mitzi found out. It was you who broke into the country club, wasn't it? You were looking for the pay stubs and these copies. Please, Ali. This could ruin me. What's going on, Darren? She threatened to tell my new employers in Boise that I stole from her. I tried to pay her back but she wouldn't have it. I broke in because she changed the locks. Why would you steal from your best friend? She said she was going to give me a raise. Plus 10 percent ownership of the pageant for all of the hard work that I've done in the last 15 years. That is until I told her I was trying for the gig in Boise. As soon as she found out she pulled the ownership offer. And my raise. I needed that money. So, you decided to give yourself a raise anyway. Mitzi could be controlling. I don't need to tell you that. She wanted me to succeed but never too much, and never on my own. She liked to help me, but just enough so that she could lord it over me, keep me under her thumb. Boise was my way out. She wanted to take that away. But I didn't kill her. Did you try and kill me? Of course not. Okay. Thank you. ♪ ♪ Sterling. You want to grill me too now? I've just spent the last 24 hours in jail. I just want to go home. Look, I don't know what you told them in there, but now it's your chance to come clean. I told them everything I know. You lied about not seeing Mitzi the day of the murder. Your homemade weed killer was found on her dress. I didn't kill her. I didn't shoot at you either. I was horrified when I heard that happened to you. Even more horrified when they ordered a gunshot residue test on me. I don't even own a gun. So, what happened that day? (sighs) I went to the country club looking for Mitzi. When I opened her office door she was laying on the floor. A pair of scissors were in her back. I bent down to check her pulse and a bottle of my weed killer fell out of my overall pocket and onto the ground, and, I guess, that's how it got on her. She was dead? Yes. Well, I panicked. I've never been in a room with a dead person before so I ran out. It was stupid, I know. And now there's a chance I'm going to prison for it. I believe you. Yeah well, you're the only one. The other night when you asked me out, you only did that because you thought I was guilty. Am I right? Um... (scoffs) You know what's really sad about all this? That you actually thought I was capable of killing someone. Darren Booth was embezzling from his best friend. It seems they weren't exactly besties as we thought. He has some real deep-rooted anger towards Mitzi. Definitely has the strongest motive yet. Puts him on top of the suspect list. Can I ask you a question? Shoot. You look really familiar to me. Have we met? Not unless you spent some time in Columbus, Ohio. (laughs) No. No. But I rarely forget a face. So, why are you here in Golden Peak? (laughs) I grew up spending my summers in Idaho. My grandparents had a place by Lake Cascade. I loved it. A lot of great memories. I woke up one day, looked out my condo window and didn't like the view anymore. Can I ask you one? Oh. Okay. Your husband, he was killed in the line of duty. What happened? He was investigating a break in. It was just a routine call. And someone shot him. He never even got his gun out of his holster. You said someone. They didn't find the killer? They did. You don't sound convinced. There are things about the case that don't gel to me. It keeps me up at night. There's more to it, I know it. I'm sorry for you loss. I truly am. If you don't stop chasing ghosts, they can eat you alive. Ken: Afternoon, afternoon. This just came back on them shell casings. Oh. You going to eat these fries?

Okay, well you guys go on and I will finish getting ready and I will meet you before the show starts. Don't be late. I'm really nervous. Oh no, don't be. I will be there and you will be fantastic.

We all have an Achilles heel. And your daughter is yours. A parent's job is to protect their children. I would do anything for her. Of course you would. Sara Hendricks. She robbed Liza of her crown just like she robbed me of mine when I was 17. And I could handle that. But for her to rat on my daughter to get her disqualified? Who does that? Yes, you were angry. Any mother would've been. I never meant to hurt Mitzi. No, I know. No, you, you got confused with, with Mitzi's new hair color and cut, and Mitzi put on Sara's jacket by mistake and from behind they looked exactly the same. And now an innocent man is going to take the fall for it. Setting up Stan was my only way out, Ali. But of course I knew you would figure it out at some point. (sighs) Please, please...
