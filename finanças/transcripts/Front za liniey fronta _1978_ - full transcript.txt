MOSFILM SECOND CREATIVE ASSOCIATION Today we say goodbye to our comrades, who gave their lives for the freedom and independence of our Motherland. At this grave of our brothers in arms we swear - to turn into a nightmare every single minute, every day and night for our enemies, while our hearts are beating, while our hands hold weapons, till the last invader stops trampling the land of our fathers and grandfathers. Years will go by. Our children will grow up proudly remembering their mums and dads. They will tell our grandchildren how we all defended our sacred land not sparing our own lives. We'll come back home. We'll bring home our victory. We swear. We swear. We swear. We swear.

Nikolay Vasilievich. Hey, nice guests! Nikolai Vasilievich, what luck running into you? Rather bad luck, Ivan Petrovich. - We need your help. Hello. - Hello, come in. Congrats with forthcoming New Year. Hello, Commissar. - Hello. - Khvat, are you Chief of Staff now? - Yes. - Good. Sashko, take a look how our guys have settled down there. Yerofeich, some tea to the Secretary of Communist Party Regional Committee. - Our tea… - Sure, will do. - Take your seats. - Now let's get down to the point. Tell me what's the matter. Last night our aviation destroyed the Ryndinsky bridge. - We've heard about it. - Here. Today at dawn a train arrived with our people locked in freight wagons. They'll be transported to Germany as a labour force. We need to set these people free. Ivan Petrovich, help our Russia formation of guerrillas. Comrade Mayor, another train has arrived. This train is of 20 tank cars with fuel. How about a New Year 'greeting' for the Germans, comrade Major? - A firework 'greeting'? - Yes, lieutenant, why not. Just to show them which is which. Right. Go. Bondarenko! Beisembaev! Move to the left bank. Your companies will render support to the Russia formation of guerrillas. First seize the train with our people locked in freight wagons. Take everyone immediately in the woods from the wagons. Don't explode echelons with fuel and ammunition before that. Clear? - Clear. - I'll join them. Right. Gasan, take Zina with you and more field medics: there may be some children. - Move, fast. - Hurry up, to the woods. To the woods. Follow us. Get out, girls! Do not be afraid! We are Red Army soldiers! Hurry up, to the woods. - Are you wounded? - Never mind! - Let me take care. Got a bandage? - Here, in the pocket. Don't worry, honey. You'll be fine. I am a doctor. - Forward! Hooray! - Hooray! - Yurchenko, are all guns safe? - Yes! - Retreat! - Yes! - Where is Gorshkov? - Here's a messenger from guerrillas. - What's up? - We about to finish. Hurry up! Tell Semirenko, we are retreating. Yes. Lie down in the sleigh. Listen, please don't tell anyone I am wounded. Take me to your guerrilla formation. Comrade Commissar, we've liberated nearly 400 people. Some are wounded, or sick, some feel very cold. Give them some hot food. We need to break away a bit furthermore. Tell them to be patient. Yes. Also take this girl: she'll help, she is a doctor. How do you know she is a doctor? Just believe me. Let's go. Step out! Comrade Major, this one was captured in the field. He had no weapon, no overcoat, just walking and crying like a baby. - Is he wounded? - He's dead drunk, Comrade Major. Where is my gear? Will they return my belongings? My suitcase… - Was there a suitcase? - Not, a damn thing – at all. Walking, weeping about his suitcase – all the way. Nearly kicked the bucket. Yerofeich! Cover him with some warm dress. Step out!

I do not know what to do: she asks to join our guerrilla formation. Fine. You'll never doubt about it. She worked in a city hospital. Good girl. She'll help you. By the way, some visited her in the hospital not only for treatment. - Just only came to look at her. - Yes, I need a doctor. - Heck! Hindering my foot march. - It's a pity to leave. I keep this Sabre since 1918. - It was Kotovsky who gave it to me. - I mean, sorry to leave you. - Oh, we'll meet again. - Happy New Year! Well, this year will be good: soft snow is falling. The earth will be good. And thank you, Commissar. - What's up, Gasan? - What? Nothing, just slightly hit. Zina! Sorry mate, I didn't know. Get on the sleigh, comrade Commissar. - Gasan, get on the sleigh. - Okay-okay. - Let's go! - Why such a noise? Well, what a pity! - All right, good luck. - Good luck. - Is the liaison the same? - As it were before. - Is Brigadenführer here? - He is busy. Does music still heal your nerves? Rudolf, are you still alive? Take off your clothes. How are you children and Gerda? Thanks. So far so good. Happy New Year! Thank you, Herr Brigadeführer. Happy New Year! Thank you. Take a seat. Glad to start working with you, Herr Brigadeführer. I need to meet Horn. Can you arrange it quickly? I received an encrypted order to render help and support to you. What are you so gloomy? Are you in trouble? What do you mean? Come on, Wolf. I'm right now from that hell by the bridge. Listen to me, Sturmbannführer Zange, within the last 2.5 years we've lost here more than a few hundred echelons with military equipment and people. The mayhem at the bridge, which you luckily escaped, is just an episode. And I expect more troubles. Lieutenant Colonel Byuttsov of the General Staff has disappeared with classified documents. In an hour I have to report this to the Commander Colonel General von Horn. If you don't find Lieutenant Colonel Byuttsov safe and alive, then he is killed, and there should be no other conclusion. Is it clear, Wolf? That's right, Commander. But you and me should have an absolutely definite information about the documents carried by von Byuttsov. I am obliged to warn you, Herr Commander. We have some data on information leakage from your Headquarters. This is your duty, Wolf. Yea…Thank you, Kruger. Air raid is over. Let's go upstairs, it's stuffy here. Remember, you have very little time for finding Byuttsov's documents. Krueger, why doesn't the lamp work? Fix it immediately. Yes, Herr Commander. Wolf, how many times did you report to Berlin that Mlynsky's guerrilla formation ceased to operate? And yet it still operates. Was it involved in yesterday's combat at the Ryndinsky bridge? Yes, it was. This is not just a guerrilla unit, it is a large centre of Russian intelligence right under our heart. Destroy Mlynsky – immediately and completely, this is your main mission, Wolf! Conventional methods of fighting them have proved to be ineffective. Sturmbannführer Zange brought a new plan, approved by Reichsführer Himmler. I'm sure we'll destroy the Mlynsky's formation. Zange needs your assistance, Herr Commander. Oberleutenant Zwunsche, Headquarter Commandant's Aid on duty arrived. - Allow him to replace the lamp. - Let him wait. Yes. - Kruger! - Yes. Bring me Sturmbannführer Zange. Yes, Herr Commander. Sturmbannführer, the Commander is waiting for you. Who's the guy? Sturmbannführer is an eminent expert in counter guerrilla warfare. Well, thank God, Hans: now we can sleep well, at last. - Did you offer him some food? - Yes. Not sure, if he ate it or not. The parasite deserves a portion of lead. Yerofeich, the stove is hot red with sparks high in the sky. Go, check it. Why do you pamper him? As a General Staff officer you should know, that silence is not the best defence. I repeat. I am a German officer. I swore allegiance to my Fatherland, and I can't break my oath. Well, Lieutenant Colonel Byuttsov, if you do not see the difference between Germany and fascism, then you risk sharing this grim fate. Take him away. - May I come? - Come in. Urgently. See the Commissar. I will come now. Herr Major, if I tell you everything I know will you save my life? I've got some news, Commissar. According to the captive Oberst, who has almost no reason to lie, the Germans create powerful fortifications in a hurry. Tank motorized divisions are being transferred from France. As the prisoner claims, all this is made in order to keep the front here at any cost, meanwhile in Germany they focus on massive efforts to build some kind of super weapon. A 'retaliation weapon', as he called it. So, he had an engineering scheme of work to build new fortified area, which was approved in Berlin. - Did he give you the scheme? - No, he left it in the train. So, I will send now two platoons on a sleigh and... Too late. And no chance to find this suitcase there. I've got another idea. So, say hello to the grandfather, tell him we miss him. - Have you stitched the encryption? - Yes, in the fly. The further you hide it, the closer you find it. This is serious, be careful, boy. Don't worry, Ivan Petrovich. You are good, but still be careful. Good luck. Lyokha, - Well, take care. - Okay. Well, Trofim, have you brought some presents? - Yes, I have. - Let me have it. Here you are. - Oh, moonshine! Ride on! - Go! Go! Hey boy, come here. - What? - Documents. - What documents? - Your documents. I'm under 15. I went to the village to change something for food. This is what I bring to my sick mum. You, bastard, shut up, drop your bag and move! Get in the car, you will go to work in Germany. - Is everything ready? - Right. We march on foot this night. If by chance even a child spots us, we'll kill him right away. How will you transport food and ammunition? We'll just carry everything we need. The enemy will provide us with the rest. Are your people well trained? Our soldiers know Russian well enough. All of them are from division Brandenburg-800. They will do away with underground and with Mlynsky. Break it down! Break it down! Get out, folks, we've arrived. Run away. And don't get arrested any more. Comrades, this is your food. It's all yours! The Nazis expropriated it to ship to Germany – it won't work. Take all this. Take as much as you can. We can't take everything for us. We have to destroy the rest. Don't be afraid, comrades, don't be afraid. Our guerrilla formation “For Motherland” will stand up for you. Now we are determined to fight in the nearby woods for a long time. Take this all, do not be afraid. Eh, well, what will be – will be! Oh my God. Come, come and take it! Well, go for it! - Where are you going, Alyosha? - I? Back home. To the city, to see my granddad. We wanted to join their guerrilla formation. - Oh, my God! - They don't allow. They say, we are too young. Well, goodbye. I am leaving. - Bye. - Good luck, Alyosha. - Wanted to join guerrillas, girls? - Yes. Possible? No, but we badly need some reliable help. Are you local? Yes, we are. Our house is right over there. - Young Communist League members? - Sure. Do me a big favour. Combat mission. One of our young men had a wound in his leg by the bayonet. He lost a lot of blood. We fear to take him to our camp in the woods. - We hide him and take care of him. - Oh, my God! - Mum, stop it. - Thank you, girls, I knew, I can trust you. Don't worry, we will come to take him back in a few days. Here you are! Well, cover him up! So good-looking! You'd better bring some water, babbler. Grandpa, grandpa, wake up. Lyoshka, Why are you hanging around the city? Well, I urgently needed to see you. You should have waited for me at home. Two days are lost already. No time to wait. - How are our folks? - They all are alive. Uncle Vanya sends you his regards. He said, he missed you. God willing. The young pig we ate just now I bought from peasants for 10 marks apiece, and I sold it for 50 marks to the owner of the restaurant. I earned some money at this dinner, my friends. - Well, gentlemen, see you later. - Bye. Smart man. I wonder, if he is that smart in the trenches. You won't see him there, he is too smart. What happened, Matvey Yegorych? Urgent message from Ivan Petrovich: there as always. I'll wait for you here at the club tonight. Just only come early: there is nothing worse than to deliver home drunk officers and their whores. What a job I've found in my old age. God, forgive me. - Okay, old man, don't grumble. Thank you. - All right... - Feldwebel. - Yes, Herr Captain. Where is the Commandant? If anything urgent, may I help you? My parents sent me a New Year parcel. It was in the train which was bombed near the bridge. All unclaimed belongings were sent to the first warehouse. Now they are being unloaded there. You can make it, if you hurry up. Thank you. Give it to me. Who are you? Captain Georg Reisner, Food Supply Unit of Quartermaster Department. - What are you doing here? - Looking for a Military Commandant. We expect two wagons of cabbage at this destination. Our Fuehrer attaches great importance to Operation 'Bismarck'. Our headquarters is entrusted and privileged to develop it. Based on the fortified areas, which we build, we'll destroy the enemy! No need to remind you of the strict secrecy in everything regarding Operation 'Bismarck'. This is the prerogative of Brigadeführer Wolf, and the Chief of Engineering Troops, Major General Schwarzenberg. Both of you will stay here, the rest are all dismissed. - You report, General. - Yes, Commander. According to special instructions for the 'Bismarck' plan, we carry out construction work in sector 27 massively with prisoners of war and civilians involved. If so, the enemy will find out about it. It will find out and also tries to look for weak points in our defence. - Do we have such weak points? - Yes, Commander. Zone "A" is weakly fortified. Behind it, there is a bottleneck between swamps, 40 km to the front line, the border of Zone "B". Schwarzenberg, all construction labour power - prisoners of war and civilians - in the Zone; should be replaced immediately with our army engineering units. Wolf, you take care of the fate of prisoners of war and civilians. Remember, no information leakage about the Zone. Thank you, Schwarzenberg. Leave the map here. Here is a plan of all work in the Zone, approved in Berlin. - I wish you good luck, General. - Thank you. Masha, I can't keep him in my house. - I have an officer who took up quarters. - What should we do? At least to stay for a night somewhere. He's probably having gangrene. They rescued us, saved us from captivity. And what we can do? The curfew starts soon. Please help. All right, wait, I'll get dressed. It'll be all right, young man. Thank you, doctor. The wound is clean, the bone is not injured, pour some water. Fever. Rather hypochondria, you know. He has a young and healthy body. You can let him leave in a few days. What's so funny, dear Andrey Andreevich? Don't be cross with me, Father Pavel Ivanovich, I just thought what honourable ladies and gentlemen say, who I once treated with bromine from fear of revolution, and you called them for humility and piety. What would they say, when they see us as Bolshevik underground agents… Indeed, the ways of the Lord are inscrutable. Would you imagine, how this all could have been different? No, dear Andrei Andreevich. We are Russian people. I really can't figure out to live separately from my people. Our people are fighting exactly for the Bolshevik Russia. For the Soviet power. And you say: the ways are inscrutable. There is no and cannot be any other way for us. Serve the officer. Good afternoon, Herr Officer. Are you interested in icons? Please. I need an old one and a little less than God's mother. What? Mother of God. I'll thank you. Chocolate. Okay, I'll look for it. We'll find it. And may this prayer remind us, so that our life is meaningful, so that we can be worthy children of our church and our Motherland. Amen. Glory to you, Christ, our God. Lord have mercy! Lord have mercy! Tonight, just for a little while electric power lines in von Horn's Headquarters must blow down. You mean, blast electric station? I'll take some fresh air. Meanwhile, I'll lock you – to be on the safe side. Good. No need to blow up anything. It should look like an accidental blackout, Kostya. Find a pole with a shield at the corner of Krasnoarmeisk and Gogol streets. - Dog's gates? - Why? When kids, we called so this pole with an oblique crossbar. You cannot walk under it: it means bad luck. Clear. You take a partner. Maybe, I take Alik? He is lame, but healthy and wants to join in. No need to explain to him ins and outs. Right. Faster. Jump. Feldwebel Allendorf! Double the exterior security! Don't let anyone into Headquarters without my permission. Yes, Herr Oberleutenant. I'll personally check internal security posts. Don't waste time. Report to the SD and also try to find out what's the matter. Follow me! Brigadeführer! A blackout occurred from 00:40 to 03:40. External and internal security has been doubled. Emergency lighting is on. There were no other incidents. Commandant's Assistant on duty Oberleutenant Zwunsche. I am pleased with your activity, Oberleutenant. Come off duty and take a rest. Guerrillas looted warehouses, I shuttle to this forgotten by God Tarasevichi. And the SD... - Can you hear me, Georg? - Yes-Yes. And the SD say: it's none of your business. Bastard. What can we do, Walter. They have their job, we have our job. - Eau de Cologne? - No, thank you. How about finding a free time in the evening for me? With pleasure, Herr Captain. Walter, I'll be waiting for you in our Department. Good. - What can I do for you? - Everything that you can do. - Move, old man, fast. - Hey, move, my dear. Send this one urgently with Lyoshka to Ivan Petrovich. - Right now? - No, in the morning. Yegorych, ours troops knocked down the Germans near Leningrad. Very good reason to celebrate! What a man! Disappeared! - You say, in Tarasevichi village? - Yes. Those dashing men from the guerrilla formation for the Motherland. May I offer him a bit – to warm up? He is nearly frozen. Rub him, Yerofeich, rub hard. Besides that, did the old man ask you to inform us anything else? No. Thank you, young man, well done. - I would have split anyway. - Relax! You'd 'have split'... Here, have a drink. - Oh, no, I don't. - Why not? You think you know a lot. The first thing is to keep your stomach warm, otherwise, God forbid, you may kick the bucket! Here, drink. - I won't. - Eh, dummy warrior… Natasha! Natasha! Where is the photo of the map? Mlynsky has just got this film. And if the weather is fine tonight, Comrade Commander... No good, General, no good. What should I report to the Chief? That we were waiting for the weather? I need facts. Unit numbers. Their location. And most importantly, why von Horn prepares to deliver assault precisely on this patch. Give an assignment to Major Mlynsky to thoroughly probe into this area. Let him employ all means. Even reconnaissance in force. Hold on, mate, be patient. So that's it. It will be all right. Nurse, apply a bandage. Well, let's see the next one. Multiple shrapnel wound of his left lung. Possibly pericardial effusion. Ivan, we are going to sow bread this spring. - Message from the Central Committee. - Good. - And what do you have to sow? - Will have it, they help. - Take a seat, Professor. - Thank you. - The lady should take a seat. - No, thank you. She's quite good. My congratulations with a good doctor. Well, among our severe patients, perhaps only two will not survive. This one with a moustache and a boy, almost a child. All the rest should be evacuated to the mainland. We'll try. - May I enter, Comrade Major? - Yes. Here are the documents of Professor Belyaev: his two-way travel tickets with punchers to Minsk. The pass is stamped by the city authorities. Here are two checkpoint stamps in Stolbtsy. His passport. Thank you, man. So, I've visited Minsk. Minsk, Andrey Andreevich – your daughter. - Does she know about it? - Sure. How does she live? - She gives her regards to you. - Thank you. Andrei Andreevich, the horn is blowing: time to leave. Well, get well, dear Gasan Alievich. - They treat you perfectly. - Thank you, Professor. Come to Baku, when the war is over. Our city is beautiful. - We also meet you so well. - Definitely, I'll come. And hopefully not like I 'visited my daughter' today. Hold on, Gasan. Aliyev must be evacuated by all means. He apparently has a lung injury. I detected some swelling. Goodbye, Doctor. I wish you to be courageous likewise. Allow me to help you: the road is long. - Thanks again. - Good bye! - All the best! - Bye. - Yerofeich, special thanks for your tea. - There was shortage of tea leaves. Forward. Put on your trench coat, you may catch a cold. No. Thank you. When is the plane landing? We have many critically wounded people. If only everything depends on our desire. I didn't have a chance to thank you for allowing me to stay in your guerrilla formation. By the way, how do you live here? I am okay. Like all the rest. Good. And there is nothing to thank me for. I am glad, I was right to make this choice. Don't worry, I'll pass that information on. I'm not worried about that. I'm worried about something else. May I stay till you come back from this sector? At least, I catch the next plane. Comrade Major, we can take off. Good. Gasan, get well soon. We'll wait for you. - Careful. - Let's take it. Come on. Let's go. Herr Major, I want to thank you. Go, Byuttsov. Your destiny is in your hands now. Goodbye, I'll see if the Commissar is okay and take the first flight back. Good luck, Zina. Irina, you are responsible for all here. Do not worry! - Bye! - Have a good trip. Write down and issue by order of the City Commandant: “In view of the villainous murder of the German Army officer, the following people are arrested as hostages: Rector of the city church, Father Paul, aka Vorobyov Pavel Ivanovich, Chief Physician of the city hospital Professor Belyaev Andrey Andreevich, merchant Egorov Zakhar Spiridonovich”. You can get the rest from our files. “If the murderers are not found, we will execute the hostages.” And so on. Print and paste up the leaflet around right away. Second. Make sure the following obituary is printed in all newspapers of the city: “Yesterday the bandits murdered villainously Oberleutenant Otto Siegfried Zwünsche, German Army officer and devoted son of his Fatherland.” Add some words – expression of sorrow etc. In due form. Where is the film? Tell us and we forget about you for a long time. Swallowed? Destroyed? Handed to someone? Namely, to whom? This is a gross misunderstanding. I know nothing. I know everything. We've been following you for a long time. Your agents are here. The priest, the doctor, the icon dealer. Everybody. If some more, they will be here soon. Even Mlynsky. Where's the film? - Hello, Erofeich! - Hello. - How is life? - Life will start in peace. We wage war. Why are you so aggressive? May I speak to you, Comrade Major? The unit returned from reconnaissance raid all along the route. - What did you spot? - Everything is quiet. We had no losses. Have you crossed the highway? The tracks are well-rolled. As to the rest, everything is quiet. Clear. Have some rest. Everything is quiet. Well, commanders, what shall we do? Yurchenko! Looks like, no suspicious clues. I'd move out. - Chief of Staff. - We're wasting time. High time to leave. Why attention was referred to sector 27. Where is that fortified stronghold area, which was mentioned by captured Lieutenant Colonel Byuttsov? Comrade Commander, let me set a fire: the prisoners are cold. Everyone is cold here, let them jump. You can't make a fire. Everything is too calm here. It's all peanuts. We need to dig deeper. Not 20 km, but 50 km. What is there? What is there? Gorshkov! Leonid! - All right – 50 km. - Tomorrow. I'll join them too, Comrade Major. Do you allow me? Russian reconnaissance unit approached the Zone. Let them go to reach combat outpost 2. Take the left road. Step out! - Move fast! - Comrade Major, we need a halt: they are tired. Sure. I see. Hello, Ivan Petrovich. - Solodov, Trofimych, are you okay? - I am still kicking. Nikolai Vasilievich, our Party Secretary asked me to see you, if you pass here. - He needs to see you. - Yes, I need to see him too. Well, we take a little rest, dry up a bit... - Where is he now? - The Secretary will come to see you, - If you tell me where to find you. - Where should he find us? There are two villages here: Smorodino and Selishchi. Thanks, I keep bearings here without maps. We can trust the village chief of Smorodino. But in the Selishchi village there is someone you know. - He was a school administrator. - Gerasim Lukyanovich? Yes, Gerasim Lukyanovich Pavlushkin. He serves the Nazis like a guard dog. He lives like the master of life. Tell the Secretary of Regional Committee, we will wait for him in Selishchi. Hello Pavlushkin. Hello. Ivan Petrovich. - May I smoke? - Yes. Have you waited for us? Sure, I have. And their garrison was here. But you haven't show up. So many things to do. Not here. - Ivan Petrovich! - What? Please, don't do it here. I haven't come to kill you, Pavlushkin. Let your fellow villagers make their judgement. Let them decide, so it will be. Off we go. Gerasim Lukyanych, invite your guest for a supper. Thank you, we have no time. Shall I wait for you? No. Don't. Water. - How long has it been? - Half a day. She is so weak. - And where is her husband? - Those bastards took her man. Towel. Is it true, Pavlushkin will be judged by the people today? - Probably. - He betrayed her husband to the Nazis, that he had provided guerrillas with bread. Well, smile. Be patient. Everything will be all right. - Hello, vagabond. - Hello, what happened? Something happened, Ivan Petrovich. Captain Afanasyev will report to you now. Here's a lost soul! Not captain Afanasyev – Hauptmann Reisner. You are still a poor Hauptmann among the Germans, however, I congratulate you, with promotion to the rank of Major and with the Order of the Military Red Banner. - Congratulations. - Thank you. Now, I have some bad news. Come on in. Make sure that no one bothers us. - Erofeich, bring something to eat. - Sure, sure. Well, now… - Sit down. - I left dirty footmarks on the floor. - No problem, feel cold? - Yes, a little. Take a seat. So, what? Zwunsche is killed. - German anti-fascist. - How… killed? Local newspapers report, someone made an attempt on his life. What attempt? Who could do it? I think the Gestapo is behind it. Probably so. Priest Pavel was arrested. Zakhar died during his arrest. If Zwunsche was under surveillance, it's not hard to trace his connections for professionals. Wolf is not an amateur. Who else was arrested? Professor Belyaev, as well. But this could be just a coincidence. If so, it's strange why they still have not traced down Alik and Kostya? Anyway, give shelter to both men. I've done it. And something else. If Zwunsche was tailed, why have they taken care of him now that we've got the plan for Operation 'Bismarck'? The murder of Zwunsche is a mystery and the arrest of his contacts is another mystery. Zwunsche provided us with information about sector 27. So, this sector 27 is also a mystery. We only tried to infiltrate a bit there and immediately encountered a bloodbath. Yurchenko and 18 soldiers died. I got a strange feeling, we have seen something, what they wanted to show us. This sector is like a bottleneck. It's hard to get through this tiny passage. Ivan, maybe all these three riddles are of the same nature: as if provided by a witch from an old fairy tale? - Here it's really warm. - Yes. Hey, what's up, Garkovenko? No-no, relax. - I'd like to smoke, Comrade Commander. - You'll have it now. - Hello. - Hello. - Well, are you warm now? - Quite warm, Comrade Commander. - Do you feel well? - All right, it's good to live. This is the main thing. How long are we here? We leave this morning. - What's the matter? - Old injury, just for bandaging. - Look, sailor. - No problem. - Are you local? - Yes, I teach children. Actually, I'm from Novgorod. I went to Crimea for vacation. And we arranged a school in this hut. There was a real teacher in this Selishchi village – Anna Andreevna Mlynskaya. She said: “Our children must study”. So, she was teaching them at home, because the Nazis stayed at the school. Then the school was burned down. They say one of our boys set fire to it. Then Pavlushkin, our Village Chief, revealed all local members of Young Communist League to the Nazis. They took these youngsters and shot them in the regional centre. I was not arrested then: nobody knew about me. Anna Andreevna found me on the road when I was reaching the village. I was sick. After recovery I started to help her teaching children. And suddenly, the Gestapo... How was it? Terrible. We had a lesson in the afternoon, when three men entered the class. One of them spoke Russian well. I remembered his last name - Klein, because Klein in German means small, but that bruiser was nearly 2 metre tall. They said “Get together” to children and old grandmother. Then they drove us out. Anna Andreevna managed to whisper us, that we need to leave far away, but we stood close and saw. They pushed Anna Andreevna out. She hugged a little girl to her. The elder boy, Volodka, tried to break free. This Klein pushed him in the car. The soldiers splashed petrol on the walls. We ran to get grandmother out of the fire, however, she was already lifeless. We're leaving tomorrow. We're leaving tomorrow. Invaders forbid you to sow grain under penalty of death. What do you think it means, comrades? This means, the enemies feel: they will not survive to see autumn in our land. Hence the earth should not yearn for a ploughman, like a woman should not yearn without a man. So, it is vital to sow, let us sow day or night. You need to do it, dear comrades. We'll give you seeds. No doubt, we'll stand up for you. Now the last issue of our agenda… Erofeich, bring him here. Here is the bastard. - Herod. - Judas! Strangle this darn bastard! What shall we do with him? Don't speak altogether at once. Who wants to speak first? I want! These little kids are orphans now! What a grief. It was the judgement of people, Gerasim, and now here's the judgement of God. Sorry. Take aim at the traitor of the Motherland! Fire! Look, Zwunsche, who did you give the film? Nobody. Be reasonable. You're German. You will not die, if you tell me where, when and whom you gave the film. I really can keep my word: in fact, you helped us. Plan Bismarck, which you gave to the Russians, is just a disinformation plot, a bait to trap the Bolshevik beasts. It's a pity, you don't believe me, Oberleutenant. After all, you will die not like a hero for them, but like a traitor. Think well, Zwunsche. Go, if you have nothing to tell me. END OF THE FIRST EPISODE
