(dramatic orchestral music) (suspenseful orchestral music) (light clicking) (suspenseful orchestral music) (rustling) (eerie ambient music) (water splashing) (creaking) (towel dispenser whirring) (intense orchestral music) - Come on. - [Alison] So, then what happened? - So, the guy at the morgue called the hospital, told them they made a mistake. They were that close to embalming him. (laughing) - Dude, we buried my grandpa last spring. What if he was still alive? (laughing) - Well, he was 95 years old. Of course he was dead. - And if he wasn't, sitting in a funeral home for five hours with her Mom, would do anyone in. (all laughing) - They suck out all your guts before they even put you in a casket. Nobody gets buried alive anymore. - Hey, you did it. - Yeah, I told you, it's your key, your lock's fine. It's a duplicate, right? - [Alison] I don't know. - Let's get to it. Heads up. - [Collin] All right, I got one. - Does it have to do anything with a terrible accident or rotting corpses? - No, but it is true. - [Cole] Right. - No, it is. - [Alison] Well, I want to hear it. - All right. It's early in the morning. Really early. And a couple walks out of a store. Or something like that. Actually, it was probably a restaurant. One of those 24-hour breakfast places. (suspenseful orchestral music) - [Cole] You suck at telling stories. - [Collin] Shh, yeah, it had to have been a restaurant for it to have been opened. They had probably stayed out all night and decided to just have breakfast instead of going home, you know how it is. The point is, is it was really early and there weren't very many people out. So as they're walking to the car, they pass this guy. neither of them has ever seen him before. As they pass him, he accidentally bumps into the guy. So the stranger pushes past and mumbles sorry, and then before anyone can react, he pulls out a pair of scissors from his coat and starts stabbing him in the face and neck. - [Jordan) What did the girlfriend do? - [Collin) Screamed Probably, she was watching her boyfriend getting stabbed for no reason. Anyway, there was an off duty cop at the restaurant, had just finished the night shift or something. He pulled out his gun and shot the psycho. - And that's a true story? - Well, there are crazy people like that out there. Can you imagine walking out of breakfast and suddenly getting stabbed by some random sociopath? - Are we gonna make it on time? What time do places like these close? - Well, you know what, blame Will if we don't get there on time. He was the one that gave us bogus directions. - Whoa, not my fault. No one told me we would have no cell reception up here. My GPS was useless. - Why are we out here in the boonies? I mean, there has to be mazes that are closer to home. - Because this is the biggest corn maze in the county. Sometimes, it takes people hours to get through. I used to go to one like this when I was a kid all the time. - I don't think we have hours. For all we know, they might be kicking people out right now. - We'll have to wait and see. It's only seven o'clock. We can always do something else. - Around here? Maybe if you're into cow tipping. (laughing) - [Alison] Hey, I am not a hick. - [Will] Nobody said you were, darlin' (laughing) Wait, pumpkin pie. Wait, wait, sugar plum. (suspenseful orchestral music) - Those things will kill you. I'm serious. (car engine revving) (suspenseful orchestral music) (car approaching) (Alison screaming) (laughing) - I can't. - [Alison] Jerk. - Yeah? - [Will] I was just coming around to help you out. - [Alison] No, you didn't. - I swear I wasn't trying to scare you. Oh, it's closed, guys. - Thank you, we know. - What are we gonna do now? - Kind of early, don't you think? - Well, days are getting shorter. Gets cold up here when the sun goes down. - Thank you, we know. (giggling) - Collin. What are you doing? - I'm seeing the corn maze. - Don't be stupid, that's trespassing. - It's a corn maze, Cole. We're not gonna be stealing anything. Or did you want to go cow tipping? (suspenseful orchestral music) (giggling) (sighing) Come on. (laughing) Guys, this is awesome. Look at this. (corn rustling) - Did you hear that? - Alison, stop, you're being paranoid. Come on. - If we get arrested, I'm telling the police I was coerced. - You know Bonnie got shot alongside Clyde, right? - Bonnie was an idiot. Never let the man plan the heist. He'll overdo it every time. Something about wearing a mask and waving a gun around makes him think he's invincible. - You don't know what you're talking about. Guns are sexy. - And that's why you don't have a girlfriend. (clearing throat) (gasping) (laughing) (suspenseful orchestral music) - Oh, ew. Gross. - Wandering around the corn only remains entertaining for so long. How much longer are we gonna do this? - Can I see your necklace? - See? - You're it. - [Jordan] You're it. (laughing) - One, two, three, four, five. (suspenseful orchestral music) 35, 36, 37, 38 (corn rustling) 48, 49. 50. - This is kind of fun. - Yeah, yeah it is. As long as Cole and Jordan don't kill each other before the night's over. - Oh, come on, you know Jordan didn't mean it. She would never say anything to hurt Cole intentionally. - She broke up with him. That seems fairly intentional. - You're not being fair. - Okay, so I'm gonna go this way, and you're gonna go that way. - No, don't leave me. - It'll be more fun if we split up. - Fine. - Turn that off. You're like a beacon. (suspenseful orchestral music) - Collin. (screaming) (laughing) You are it. Looks good on you. Give me a couple of seconds to make my getaway. - One, two, three, four, five. 13, 15, 19, 25, 29. (corn rustling) 30. Ready or not... (thudding) (screaming) (gasping) - Who was that? It wasn't funny. Cole? That could have fallen on me. (eerie ambient music) - Ah, ow. (eerie ambient music) Hello? Will? Will? I can't, I dropped my glasses. I can't see anything. Collin, is that you? Oh, sorry, sorry. Collin, if you're it, I'd really appreciate it if you'd just help me find my glasses first. Come on, I can't see anything. (footsteps approaching) They're around here somewhere. What are you doing? Stop it. Collin? Collin? - Cole? Just get out here so I can tag you. (eerie ambient music) Following me isn't funny. (gasping) Hey, you're not... Who are you? Hey, hey, wait. Hey, we're not doing anything out here. (intense orchestral music) - Will, I'm so glad I found you. This maze is freaking me out. Crap, you're it. Well, I guess that means I'm it now. And by the way, have you seen Collin? He's being a total creep. - Alison, there's someone else in the maze. - What do you mean? Other than the five of us? - Yes, I just saw him. He was just here. - Wait, I saw him, Will. - What do you mean you just... - I saw him. My glasses fell and I couldn't see, and someone came down the path. I thought it was Colin. - Alison, Alison, what happened? - He grabbed me, he like threw his arms around me, and I thought it was Collin. - Come on, we're gonna find him and we're gonna take care of this. - If there's someone in there, I don't want to find him, Will. Listen, I have the key, why don't we just get out of here and go to the car? - Whoa, you think we should leave everyone here? - No, I think that we would be safer if we went to the car. - No, it will be safer if we stick together. Let's go. - Whoa, whoa, whoa. I am not it. I got Will. - Let me see your neck. What if you put it somewhere else? - Wouldn't that be cheating? - I don't know. The rules were not very clearly established. - If I were it, you'd already be caught. I'm definitely faster than you are. However, if I'm not it, we'll walk together? Then you'll always know you're safe with me. (laughing) - Yeah, but then I'd have to walk with you. It's a double-edged sword. - I suck at this game. (eerie ambient music) - Will, what is it? - [Will] Nothing, just looking around. - Do you think this is real? - I don't know. - Will, I really think that we should get out of here and just... (intense orchestral music) (grunting) - Punk, you can't go around scaring people like that. (scissors clattering) (suspenseful orchestral music) - Will? Will? (Alison screaming) - Jeez, Alison. (scissors stabbing) (suspenseful orchestral music) - Will must have gotten her. - So Will is it? - I told you that. (Alison panting) - What is wrong with her? She couldn't be any louder if she tried. - You know, being scared isn't always a bad quality. Sometimes, it's more fun. - If it could get us arrested, it's a bad quality. She needs to learn to control herself. (suspenseful orchestral music) (breathing heavily) - You think Will and Alison are actually playing or stopped somewhere and making out? - They're probably just chasing each other back and forth and not even looking for any of us. (suspenseful orchestral music) (gasping) (dramatic orchestral music) - Hey Brian, it's Sarah. Um, I just called 'cause I thought we were supposed to meet around nine. and I never heard from you, so I guess, um, I'll call you back later. I'm sorry, I haven't heard from him either. We were supposed to go out a couple of hours ago and I don't know, he just never showed up. Yeah, definitely. I'll let you know if I hear from him. Okay, bye. (keypad clacking) (phone ringing) - Sheriff's department. This is Officer Larsen. - Hey, Marcus, it's Sarah Turnin. - Hey, Sarah, how are you doing this evening? Everything okay? - I think so. I hope so. I'm a little worried about Brian. - Brian Mckinley? - Yeah, we were supposed to meet up a couple of hours ago and he never showed. - We can't file a missing person's report if it's only been for a couple of hours. - I know, Marcus. I'm just wondering if you'd seen him. - [Marcus] I can't say that I have. - Has Eric seen him? - Eric's shifts over. Have you tried Mim's? - [Sarah] I already called the bar. He hasn't been there. - That's odd of Brian. When was the last time you saw him, Sarah? - Oh, it was a little bit before seven, at Sam Hunt's corn maze. - I'll tell you what. Why don't you give him a call tomorrow morning? If you still can't find him, we'll make some phone calls. Is that okay? - Yeah, yeah, I'm sure he'll be fine. Um, sorry for overreacting so much. - [Marcus] That's okay. You have a good night now. We'll talk later. - Okay. Good night. (scoffing) (eerie ambient music) - Hello? Is there someone in there? Come on, you're making me miss my show. You come out now, I won't call the police. People, they're blind. I'm gonna shoot somebody. - Look, uh, I'm sorry about earlier. I wasn't thinking. - No problem. Um, guess you would be the one who knows about my date-ability, so... - Don't be like that. I'm trying to apologize. - Yeah, well, you suck at it. - Nevermind. Your dating life is none of my business. Die old and alone for all I care. (metal clinking) (suspenseful orchestral music) (ominous orchestral music) - If it's you Johnson kids again, I'm gonna string you up like the pig-faced delinquents you are. This isn't a game. I am tired. I am cold. I am armed. I don't trust anyone on this earth. (corn rustling) (eerie ambient music) (laughing) - [Jordan] We need to get out of here. - [Cole] You always were smarter than the other girls. - [Jordan] Yeah, let's, let's wait a couple minutes to just make sure he's gone. (suspenseful orchestral music) (footsteps approaching) (suspenseful orchestral music) (corn rustling) - I hear you out there. Don't make me use this. (corn rustling) (intense orchestral music) (gun firing) - What the hell was that? - Was that a gun? - No, it couldn't have been. He wouldn't have actually shot one of us. Maybe we should be going. We don't want him to get to the car before us. - Wait, doesn't Alison have the keys? - Yeah. And if she's as scared as I think she is, do you really think she's gonna wait for us to get back before she takes off? - Right. (suspenseful orchestral music) (scissors stabbing) - The keys. The keys. (dramatic orchestral music) (suspenseful orchestral music) - Alison had the flashlight. Don't touch him. - Who would have done this? - [Cole] Jordan, we really need to get out of here. - Cole, my necklace. - I don't know, okay? I gave it to Will. - Where's Will? Will wouldn't have done this. - Look here, we really have to get out of here, right? - Where is he, where is Alison? Where is, where is Collin? - They would have heard the shot, all right? We've got to get out of the corn maze. We have to get back to the car, okay? Please. All right? - Okay. (sobbing) (suspenseful orchestral music) - Damn it. (scissors slicing) (screaming) - I heard something. - What is it? - I think I heard someone. - Come on, we're getting close. We got to go. - No, I think I heard something. - Jordan, let's go. (groaning) (scissors stabbing) (gasping) (grunting) Anything yet? - No. And we're not gonna find anything while we're in this maze. There's nothing out here. - Okay, here, try mine. - Nothing. - Do you even recognize any of this? - Of course, I don't. It's corn. - Yeah, I know but I feel like we should be getting closer. - Cole? (suspenseful orchestral music) (breathing heavily) That was Will. - I know. If he got Will, that means he's gotten Alison. That was her flashlight that the old man had. - Where's Collin? - I don't know. He's smart, but that guy's fast. Can you walk? - I don't know. (sobbing) - Now is not the time to experiment, it's over. I can, I can distract him. - No, don't be stupid. We don't know where we are in the maze. - All right, I'm gonna go. When the coast is clear, I need you to make a break for it. I need you to head to the farmhouse. Use the telephone. Call the police. Get them here. (dramatic orchestral music) - Cole, wait. I'm sorry. (eerie ambient music) (corn rustling) (suspenseful orchestral music) (gun clicking) (spitting) - Still having fun? Where you going? I'm not done with you yet. (grunting) (eerie ambient music) Jordan, run! (guillotine slicing) (suspenseful orchestral music) (Jordan sobbing) (suspenseful orchestral music) (eerie ambient music) - Where the hell is this? Damn it. (intense orchestral music) (grunting) (dramatic orchestral music) No, no. (Jordan crying) (Jordan vomiting) (footsteps approaching) (suspenseful orchestral music) (Jordan screaming) (suspenseful orchestral music) (scissors stabbing) (dramatic orchestral music) - [Cop] What happened? - I killed him, I killed him. (siren wailing) (sirens wailing) - Yeah, okay. I got it. We'll be ready. Sam's corn maze burned down tonight. - Anyone hurt? - So far, just a young woman came out screaming. She's gonna come in for questioning after the paramedics have a look at her. - She a local? - Well, Joe didn't recognize her. She's probably a townie. - [Marcus] What do you think? Arson or accident? - Who knows? Those corn mazes are like tinder boxes. They're a massacre waiting to happen. And arson might just be the beginning of the night. - What do you mean? - The girl came out screaming "I killed him." She was covered in blood. Paramedics said they found cuts on her. - So you mean we got ourselves a homicide. - I don't know, but I'm gonna go call our forensics team. - You mean Joey? - Yeah, he'll be excited to get some work. - Yeah, not me. You want me to call anyone else? - Mm-mm. Let 'em sleep. County's just gonna come in and take over everything anyway. Jurisdiction thing. And we won't know anything about anybody getting killed till they comb over that field. - What about Sam? Has anyone talked to him? I bet you he's pretty upset his corn field burned down. - Yeah, we sent an officer over to knock on the door, but he didn't show. Lights were on in the house. Well, get him on the phone. See if you can't get him to come down here, he's gonna have to give a statement eventually anyway. (phone dialing) (phone ringing) (eerie ambient music) (eerie piano music) (woman chattering) - [Woman] Oh, I'm sorry. I thought I wrote it down, but I don't have it. (suspenseful orchestral music) (lighter sizzling) See you later. Okay, bye. (eerie piano music) (lighter sizzling) - Need a lift? It's cold out there. You gotta be crazy to walk out in this weather. (laughing) With that coat. (laughing) That's a sweater. (laughing) It's a thing for like covering your face. Why, 'cause you know, ah, they don't have a lot of torque in this car. Sorry, bear with me. Where can I take you? - [Eric] Police station. - Yikes. Did I say that out loud? (laughing) Just kidding. One of those nights, huh? Well, lay it on me. Just kidding, don't tell me. Better off. You know, I don't want to be an accomplice to anything you may have done. (sighing) - How could she have gotten so much blood on her? Something happened out there, more than just arson. - County's gonna come, pick up the evidence. We are not equipped to deal with the amount of blood that came off of her. - Well, she wasn't talking to me. Did she say anything to you about what happened, who she killed? - No. I don't think we're gonna get anything out of her either. (sighing) - Who are you calling? - I'm gonna try Sam Hunt again. I think we're gonna find out that this is even worse than we thought. (phone dialing) (telephone ringing) - You got to remind me where the station is because the last time I was there, I was about 15? Hey, not passing judgment, mister. Not from me. You hear that sound? That's awkward silence. (laughing) You get me? Just kidding. - Okay. Thank you, we'll be in touch. - Well, they found two bodies. - Sam and Brian? - No, they're still looking for the head of one. The other body's in one piece, just too badly burnt to identify. - I'll give you five minutes to get me some answers. - Ah, you know what they do in those corn fields during the summer? I was just driving by the other day and I saw just hundreds of ears of corn, all this corn just sitting out there, just rotting away. You know the colorful corn, um, you know from grade school, what is that called? What's that stuff? (sirens wailing) What the hell, what's, oh, come on. Damn it, I wasn't speeding. I wasn't speeding. Was I speeding? You know what, this town has always had it in for me, my sister's gonna kill me. - [Eric] Pull over to the side. - Aw, that's not even registered. Aw, son of a bitch. - [Eric] Shut up and pull over. (siren wailing) Indian corn. (laughing) - Yes, yes, Indian corn. (laughing) Whoo. Ha, I was driving by one just the other week. You know what they do? They go ahead and grind it all up, everything. Every last little bit of it. They chop it all up, the corn, the husk, everything, and they serve it as feed for cattle. My nephew told me that. They don't waste anything in this town. Learned that from the Indians. Oh, sorry, Native Americans. You know, I hate this town. - [Eric] Me too. (chair creaking) (sighing) - William Taylor. Did you know him? There was another body. Without a head. Did you know that person? (sobbing) Are we gonna find more bodies? (sobbing) - Make sure you catch a lift home. (suspenseful orchestral music) (clattering) (telephone ringing) - It's the on-site team. Do you want me to answer it? - No, I got it. Yeah? (clearing throat) Okay, do we have somebody that can bring him in for examination? Yeah, keep me posted. Found three more bodies. And the head. (sighing) - Ha, Eric. It's good to see you. Been hell of a night. - Tell me about it. - What? - No, I just saw the fire and figured you guys could use some help. - No, the fire's only the beginning of it. - Yeah, they found five bodies out there. - And our only survivor is our only suspect. - And she's not talking. - Have you collected evidence yet? - [Marcus] Of course. - Yeah, evidence and screaming confession aside, there's something in my gut that just doesn't feel right. - You don't think she did it? - Well, her cigarettes and her lighter point to her as the arsonist. Accidental or not, but I just don't think she can cut off a guy's head. She knows what happened in there, she knows who really did all this, but she's not talking. - What do you need me to do? - I want you to hold down the fort. Marcus and I are gonna go out to the field to see what else we can dig up. - Yeah, you think you can handle it? (creaking) (suspenseful orchestral music) (scissors stabbing) (Alison screaming) (gasping) (screaming) (breathing heavily) - Jordan, run! (dramatic orchestral music) (breathing deeply) (panting) (door clicking) - I'm Officer Eric Schroeder. I just need to collect some more evidence. Looks like you've been through a lot tonight. They're finding a lot of bodies out there. They were your friends, weren't they? - Yes. (sobbing) They were. - Except Sam Hunt, the corn maze owner, he, he wasn't your friend and he's dead too. Did you kill him? - No. - Of course not. (sighing) To tell you the truth, I don't think you actually killed anyone. I think you and your friends are guilty only of being in the wrong place at the wrong time. But I'm just a new guy in a small town. No one here is gonna care what I think. I can't help you unless you tell me exactly what happened out there. I know it's hard, I know. But I need to know what you know so that we can lay this thing to rest. Will you tell me what happened out there? - Yeah, I will. - Good. Good. Let's start with the first thing. Who did you kill or think that you killed? (sighing) - The man in the red hood. - Does this man have a name? - He never spoke. - But did you get a good look at him, could you identify him if you were to see him in a line up? - I don't know, it was dark. - Why were you in the corn maze so late? - [Jordan] Because we got there late and we wanted to see it anyway. - So you were trespassing. - Yes. - And did you see Sam Hunt, the corn maze owner out there? - The man with the shotgun. - Did he find you and your friends? (sighing) - We may have found him. We were, we were separated playing a stupid game. - What do you mean by, what do you mean? Stupid game? - Collin, he has a special version of tag and whoever's it wears something (clearing throat) like a scarf or a head band... - Piece of jewelry? - Yeah. Like a necklace. Like tonight. That's how we got separated. And he found us all. - Who won? - Excuse me? - The game. Who won the game? - I'm sorry, I don't understand. (telephone ringing) - Excuse me. (telephone ringing) (suspenseful orchestral music) Yes, I understand, sir. I'll make sure she feels completely comfortable. No, I don't, I don't think she did it either. The evidence won't lie. Got it. (suspenseful orchestral music) (breathing heavily) (door clicking) Okay. You can clean yourself up now. They found another body. That's five. But they still haven't found a man in a red jacket. I know you didn't kill anybody. Help me figure out who did. - It's all my fault. They're all dead because of me. I lit the corn on fire. The farmer shot my boyfriend. - Jordan, are you sure? - It's all my fault. I'll write it down. I'll confess it to the judge. I can't take it anymore, I can't. I can't take the guilt. - Okay. (suspenseful orchestral music) It's okay. You're doing the right thing. They'll believe it. Ah, you bitch. - You monster. You killed my friends. - You stabbed me several times. I'd say we're about even, wouldn't you? - I'm gonna kill you. - Oh, but you've already done so much more than that, see, you killed everyone else. Between the DNA evidence that I planted in the partially signed confession, I'd say, you've taken care of everything. See, I told you, you didn't kill anyone. (suspenseful orchestral music) (suspenseful orchestral music) (gasping) (screaming) (Eric laughing) Oh, you thought I was gonna give you the gun with bullets? No, no. You have already shot that gun all through the police station. Luckily for me, you are a bad aim and count, so that, when you grazed my leg (gun firing) (grunting) (breathing deeply) and went in for the kill, I shot you. (gasping) At least, that's what the police report is going to say. (Jordan screaming) That's right, struggle. It'll make it all the more believable. That gun does have bullets. What are you gonna say after you shoot me? That I killed your friends? Who would believe you? You kill me, you die too. - [Jordan] I don't care. - But I think you do. I think you're like me. You're a survivor. - [Jordan] I'm nothing like you. - Okay. What do you want? - [Jordan] An apology. - An apology. Really? - [Jordan] Put your hands up. (laughing) - Okay. I'm sorry. - [Jordan] For what? - For killing your friends. For killing Sam Hunt. For killing Brian, oh wait. You don't know about him, but I'm sorry about it anyway. (door slamming) (gasping) - [Jordan] You're a monster. - You want to know what I'm most sorry about? That I didn't kill you. (gun firing) - What the hell is going on? - The lights went out and she got the drop on me. I couldn't even see when I shot her. (dramatic orchestral music) - [Sheriff] She's still alive, call the paramedics. (tape whirring) (tape clicking) - [Eric On Tape] What are you gonna say after you shoot me? That I killed your friends? Who will believe you? You kill me, you die too. - [Jordan On Tape] I don't care. - [Eric On Tape] But I think you do. I think you're like me. You're a survivor. - [Sheriff] Eric, put the gun down. - What do you want? What? - [Jordan] An apology. - Put the weapon down. - [Eric] Really? - [Jordan] Put your hands up. - [Eric On Tape] I'm sorry. - [Jordan] For what? - [Eric On Tape] For killing your friends. For killing Sam Hunt, for killing Brian, oh, wait, you don't know about him, but I'm sorry about it anyway. - [Jordan On Tape] You're a monster. - [Eric] You know to know what I'm most sorry about? That I didn't kill you. (suspenseful orchestral music) (suspenseful orchestral music) (dramatic orchestral music)
