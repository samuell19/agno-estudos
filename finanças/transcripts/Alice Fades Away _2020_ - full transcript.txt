I wished for you and you came true. - Did you really? - Mm-hm. What did he see in her? I never figured that out. For the life of me. Dad is rarely ever home. Usually it's just me and Mom. Wonder what he does all day. People listen to him when he talks. Everyone stops what they're doing. This makes Mom jealous. No one pays attention to her. I want to be like him. I want to have what he has. Be what he is. We took the train. No, it was empty. Sit down. How long will you be here? Alice. Uncle Bishop. Why'd you come back here? I don't know. You look just like your mother. Welcome back, Alice. Everyone, welcome Alice to our home. Welcome. Would you like some breakfast? Yes, please. Here you go. You are going to eat first and talk later.

Bravo. You don't see what he's doing here, do you? - Who? - Bishop. I'm not sure. Took me a while to get used to it but you will. Used to what? Anyone is welcome here whenever they like. Where do they come from? Anywhere. We don't ask and they don't need to tell. - Hi, buddy. - Hello. Give me a kiss. - Is he yours? - No. Who are his parents? Some passerbys left him here last spring. You didn't call the police? We take care of him now. People come and go all the time here, Alice. Most are decent people. His parents arrived in a hurry, and they left in a hurry too. Don't feel bad for him. Some people just aren't meant to be parents. I know and I'm sorry. Remember what I told you. It's okay, you're safe. It's okay, you're safe. What do you think? What is this place? It's the remains of the old town. Come inside. I heard screaming again last night. That was Everett. What's wrong with him? Nightmares from the war. It helps him being here. He knows that. Are you two, uh, romantic? No. Then why stay in his room? He needed someone to be there for him, so I stayed. Can we go? Of course. Dad! Dad! Mom! Mom! Help! What the hell? Harold, you can wait outside. You know about Carroll's death? I read it in the papers. Good. Read he died protecting his wife and child during a mugging. Mm-hm. That's not Carroll. Well, they print what I want them to. What about the truth? You never met Carroll's wife, did you? She took my grandson and she ran off like a coward. She is out there. She is out there. And I need you to go get my grandson and bring him home. And I don't want her coming back looking for him. You understand me? I... Holden, I... I've been having a dream lately. Every night my teeth start coming out one by one, And after a while, I... I start pulling them and they just... To my horror, they just fall out. Until there's nothing left. Why are you telling me this? Because Carroll is dead and Margaret is gone, and that boy is all that I have left. Holden, go on, go get my grandson, bring him home. All right? For me.

It's not so bad. Where's Dad? Listen, you're too young to understand, okay? Just don't hate me for it. We took the train. No, it's empty. What... what's wrong? Logan... what did you do? I told you. I want to go home. I called the police. Doesn't matter. You left the door unlocked. So I came in. I'm here to rescue my son. I have no idea what you're capable of. - I didn't do anything. - Of course you did. Of course you did! Please! Please. What are you afraid of? Hm? It's over. I just wanna... I just wanna go home. I love you. Logan. Logan, no, no, no. No, no, no. Son... It's okay. I'm just gonna take this, all right? It's all right. Just give it to me. It's okay. It's all right. It's okay. Don't you ever, ever raise your hand at me. Do you understand me? Don't you ever... At peace with her? Absolutely. Very helpful. What do you remember most about this home? I remember... Uh, we spent summers here when I was a child. And, um, you taught me how to shoot your M1. You'd line out glass bottles on a ledge out in the field. I've come a long way. You know that, right? I know. You know what I remember? What? I remember this cold child. Even then... One that concerned me as to how she'd turn out. You know why your folks stopped coming here? No. I stumbled up on you down by the water. You were watching as Harry nearly drowned in the pond. You didn't do anything. I don't remember that. I do. There are a lot of good people here and I don't wanna see them hurt. I know. You thought about going back to your people? I don't have anyone left. All right, then. We'll put it to a vote. Who here wants Alice to stay? Well, if you'll excuse me... I'm off to bed now. Do you want to stay here with us? Yes. Then stay. But why? Why would you let me stay? You barely know me. I lost my husband a few years back. Everett was in the war. Bishop, his boys and wife. Dana lost her parents. We've all suffered. You're amongst friends. My husband has associates. What do you mean? Uh, Carroll comes from a very powerful family. Where is he now? He's dead. Did you kill him? No. No. Um... I took Logan and I ran. His mother Margaret, she, um... She resented me. Her baby married to a poor dirt farmer from Tennessee. I tried to be different. I tried to be him. Gentler, and quieter, prettier. And stay in my place more. And then I tried to run. ♪ As I travel through This pilgrim land ♪ There is a friend Who goes with me ♪ Guides me safely Through the sinking sand ♪ It is the Christ at Cavalry Logan. Logan, no, no. No! Oh, I'm sorry, I'll leave you alone. No, you... you can sit. You can sit. That scares me more than anything else now. What? The silence. A bullet. That's how both my boys died. It was quick though. Painless. I spent two years in the trenches in France. Praying hard that nobody should see. I took every piece of me over there. First few years, I was back, I couldn't get the stench out of my nose. I'd been living with... rotting bodies for so long. And one day, my boys didn't come home... that smell came back. And then... I watched, my Taylor, rot away. She just disappeared in front of my eyes. I don't know which is worse anymore. If we're lucky enough to survive us killing one another... then all this will eventually finish us all. Something's coming. That smell. It's back. Alice, you coming in? Um, yes. You came back. I knew you made it out. Thomas... Where's Thomas? I just wanna see my boy. I just wanna see my boy. There's a man out there in the field. He's probably just lost. I'll just go out there. You should probably take your axe. What do I need that for? Just to be safe. I'm just gonna talk to him. Everett. Take it. Okay. Maybe he's one of the men from town. What did Everett say? He's gonna go talk to him. Hey, where you going? Do you remember what we talked about? Okay, so you want to grab one toy, okay? Bishop, open the door, please. Is something wrong? We're not safe, are we? No. Well, what should we do? We'll walk to the nearest house. That's five miles from here. We need to get help. We can't. He'll see us if we leave. Let's just make sure that the doors are locked. What about Everett? Everett can take care of himself. How many men did you kill? I don't know. Yes, you do. How many men? Zero. Zero? I was on the front lines for one day. I was shot in the left leg and... I was sent home after that. You were in battle for just one day? I was captured by the Japanese on the Island of Java, near Singapore. You know where that is? Yes. You see the Kempute would burst into our camp and scream out the numbers of some of our men. Then they would take them out into the woods... Kind of like this. And they would have them dig their own graves. And all we could do was sit in our bunks, with a handful of rice, listen for the gunshots. And one day, they called my number. They took us out and lined us up. We dug a big, deep pit. And then they blindfolded us. And one by one, they shot each and every one of us. But the next thing I remember is waking up in that pit. Surrounded by all of my dead men. They let me live. Just to see what it would do to me. I'm sorry. No, you're not. But you will be. Help me. Help me! Someone, please. Please, help me. Someone! Dana! Dana, please. Anyone! Help, please! Please! Was it Everett? I don't know. I caused this. You left the door unlocked. So, I came in. I have no idea what you're capable of. - I didn't do anything. - Of course you did. You're a good person, aren't you? Yes. Of course you did! Please! Please. What are you afraid of? Hm? Do you think you deserve to die now? No. I agree. But it's not up to me. It's up to Alice. Logan. Logan, no no, no. It's all right. It's okay. If you come in here, I'll shoot you. That's where you've been hiding? Come here. You okay? Is the monster out there? Yes. Did you get Everett killed? Every decision I ever made was because it was... what someone else wanted me to do. You know, my home, my marriage, my child. I never had the opportunity to choose. But this time... This time, it was different. You don't know what it's like. You don't know what it's like to... want to protect a child with your life. And then what it feels like when you fail. And I'm not certain if I'm sane anymore. I don't know how anyone could... ...could really know that. But I do know that I brought this here. And I'm trying to think of every reason why I shouldn't go out there and give myself up. And? I mean it may be crazy... but... I do know that man out there is cruel and sadistic. Something that ugly doesn't deserve to be in this world anymore. How? There's a car on the other side of the woods. It's far from here, but I can get it. He'll find you. Maybe. But I have to try. Is that him? Yes. Just give it to me. It's okay. I told you. I want to go home. Keys. I gave that gun to Carroll when I came back from the war. Yeah. Alice. I wasn't sure you knew my name. Why are you calling me? You giving sympathies about my sons? Did you know your sons? I thought I did. I'm not so sure now. How about you. Did you know Logan? Yes. Where are you? - Away. - Uh-huh. Let me guess. A dirt farm. Man on a tractor drives by and waves, while the women hang laundry on the line and work in the garden around the back. Huh? Maybe you're in Tennessee, or Alabama. It doesn't really matter because you're doing what you know. And you never should have left in the first place. I'm just away. Away sounds good. Away sounds peaceful. I'm learning to live with it.
