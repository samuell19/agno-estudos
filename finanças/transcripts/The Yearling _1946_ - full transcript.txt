Lake George, Florida, April 1878. I came across this lake once, some years ago, in a little mail boat that brought me home after fighting in the war with the Yankees. Came down this broad river going back into the wilderness, away from civilization, looking for a place to settle, a place to live... Back into the scrub country. It got Wilder as I got deeper into the woods. I liked it. Vegetation was denser-- the trees had to struggle for a breath of air. Even Wilder here as I got back closer to the sources, to the beginning of things, further away from towns and wars. And then I left the river, went right into the woods themselves. And here was the scrub country. Not many people lived here then, just a few pioneers. I found myself a wonderful wife in a little village nearby, and between us, out of this rolling sea of trees, we cleared and cultivated a little piece of half-fertile ground we call islands, like this one. That was many years ago, but we still live here. We've had our hardships and our happinesses. This is our home. It's called Baxter's island. That's my name, penny Baxter. Here's where we live-- me, my wife Ory, and our little boy Jody. Jody! Jody! Hey, coon. Them's mighty pretty little fellas you got. Jody! You want Jody, Ma? Where's that boy at? Oh, I reckon he's around somewheres. Most likely gallivanting somewheres where it don't do nobody a mite of good. What he's doing is something that's got to be done. I need some water! We'll bring you some, Ma. When did you get back from logging? Just getting back now. Hello, Pa. Hello, Jody. Gets late mighty quick, Pa. Afore you know it. Well, that's April for you. Where you been? To the Glen. I lay down, and 'fore I knew it, I was asleep. Come on, Caesar. Some honeybees was here, and I aimed to follow them and find the bee tree. You find it? Dogged if I didn't forget to look for 'em till now. Ah, tell the truth, Jody, and shame the devil. Weren't that bee tree a fine excuse to go ramblin', too? A notion taken me to go a-ramblin', too. That's what I figured. On my way back, I was saying to myself, there's Ma, now, busy in the house, and there's Jody, hoeing in the corn field all by hisself, and that hoe's a-gettin' heavier every minute. I expect he's thinking, "on a fine spring day like this, I ought to go ramblin'." That the way you figured? That's the way I figured, Pa. But your Ma don't hold with ramblin'. Most womenfolks can't see for their lives how a man loves so to ramble. I never let on you wasn't here. I said, "oh, reckon he's around somewheres." Us menfolks has got to stick together in the name of peace. Yes, Pa. Pa! Yes, boy? I seen a sight today down at the Glen-- a mammy coon with 2 babies. They was the prettiest little fellas you ever seen. Coons is pretty. Pa, you think it's worth speaking to Ma about it? Them little fellas was so pretty that if I should snare me one of 'em for a pet, I bet even Ma would love it. Your Ma ain't gonna go loving no coons. You reckon she'd get mad if I was to mention it? What do you reckon? You two home at last? Yes, Ma. I reckon she would. But I wish I had me something to pet and play with. Pa, you said menfolks has got to stick together in the name of peace. That's right, boy. Well, I were thinking, if you was to speak to Ma about that little coon-- no, thank you. Thank you kindly. I ain't aiming to die afore my time. Now, come on. Now, you best get down to the sinkhole and bring your Ma some water. Yes, Pa. Hey, old Ma! I like you, Ma. Hmm. You and the rest of the stock get mighty loving when I got a dish in my hand. That's the way you're the prettiest. That ain't sweet 'tater pone, is it, Ma? It's sweet 'tater pone. It's sweet 'tater pone! Pa! A big old buck watered down at the Glen today. I seed it-- when was you down at the Glen? Today, Ma. So that's it. And me a-callin' and a-callin'. You gettin' slick as a Clay road in the rain. I fooled you, Ma! I fooled you! Say it, Ma. I got to fool you once! You fooled me. Evenin', Ma. And you just as bad as the boy. You both gettin' mighty sly. Now sit down afore the pone steams off to nothing. Dear lord, thanks again for the vittles. Amen. I declare, that's a mighty skimpity blessing, seems to me. I always get hungry when I go logging. The lord will know what I mean. Ma...Ma, I seed a thing today. Well, must I hear it, or must I live in ignorance? 'Twere only a big old frog. A big old frog, eh? A big old frog! Hmm. Mighty interesting. Good night, Pa. Good night, boy. Good night, Ma. Good night. Pa. Pa! What is it, boy? Does a coon always wash everything before he eats it? Does he, Pa? That's right, boy. Now go to sleep. If'n a coon always washes everything before he eats it, he must be a pretty clean animal, eh, Pa? Oh, coons is clean. Now lie down, boy. I guess a coon takes care of hisself pretty well, don't he, Pa? Well, most animals take care of themselves, boy. Now get to bed. What's all this talk about coons? Don't know, Ma. Did I tell you I seen an old coon today, Pa? Yes, you told me. Now go to sleep, boy! Did I tell you she had a couple of babies? Yes, you told me that, too. I bet if Ma had seen one of them little old baby coons, she'd have loved it to death. Jody, we ain't a-gonna have no coons around here. What about a little baby bear cub, then, if'n I should one, or a possum? I'd love to have a baby fox or a baby panther. Jody! But, Ma, I just gotta have me something for a pet. We got milk a-plenty. What you mean, we got milk a-plenty? There ain't a extra drop from sun to sun. It could have mine! Now, don't tell me again it can have yours. You're spindly enough as it 'tis. How you think we can spare rations for some critter whereas all we can do is keep our own bellies full? But I just want something all my own, something to follow me and be mine... Something with dependence to it. Well, you'll not find that nowheres-- not in the animal world, nor in the world of man. Going on 12 and still wanting some kind of a play Dolly. Your Pa was doing his man's share of work time he was your age. Now stop pestering and get to bed afore I take a brush to you. Yes'm. Good night. Good night, Pa. Night, son. Seems like you get mighty hard on the boy at times, Ory. Then let him tend to work. Always running off, always wanting to bring some pesky critter into the house. Well, a boy ain't a boy too long. Leave him kick up his heels a little now. The day will come he won't even want to. Ory, I've seen our boy stand agaze and breathless at the wonderment of the bird and the critter, wind and rain, and the sun and the moon, just like I stood when I was a boy in the forest. Don't be afraid to love the boy, Ory. I'll put up the stock. What's the matter, Pa? Your Ma's gone down to the burying grounds, son. Oh, Pa, a couple of old buck deer were in our burying grounds today. I seed their tracks. The gate was broke, and little Ory and little David's markers were knocked down. Well, now, your Ma wouldn't like that. I was obliged to right 'em. Pa, one of them markers had something writ on it, but it's getting kind of dim. I can't make it out no more. That's Ezra Jr.'s. He never seen the light of day. You mean he died right off when he was born? That's right, son. Ma never talks about him, does she? No. Are they part of Ma's raring, Pa? So you figured that out all by yourself, did you, son? I were just wondering. I'm proud you're beginning to look round for the reason of things, figuring out what makes people rare sometimes and they don't really mean it. Your Ma is a wonderful woman, Jody. Yes, Pa. When we come out here years ago, she was that pretty and full of the fun of life. She was a thing to see. This place was just a wilderness then, but your Ma thought it were beautiful. She pitched in and worked as hard as I did, right alongside of me. We made it a kind of game, clearing this here place we got-- the two of us together, out here in the wilderness. A man couldn't have had a better wife. And then, when we lost the children, one after t'other... Well... 'Tain't easy for a woman to have her young'uns taken away from her like that, son. It does something to her. Makes something inside her close up tight, so if it happens again, she ain't gonna let it hurt her so much next time. I were lucky, weren't I, Pa? I'm 11 years old. I'm a-way past the age of dying. Ezry, what you two doing in there? You stop visiting. It's time that boy got to sleep. All right, Ma. He's a-goin' to sleep. Pa! Pa! Pa! Pa! Pa! Come look what's happened! It's a calf and a shoat! The barn door on the other end was broke down! Take it easy, boy. But what happened, Pa? What done it? Bear. Big 'un. Look there. One toe's missing on the right front paw-- old Slewfoot! Old Slewfoot. But none of the dogs bayed him, Pa, 'less'n I didn't hear for sleeping. None of them bayed him. He had the wind in his favor. Don't think he didn't know what he was doing. We got to get him, Pa. We just obliged to get him. I'm daresome to break the news to your Ma. What happened? What you two doin' in there? What's the matter with you two? I been calling and call-- bear? It's old Slewfoot, Ma. Old Slewfoot. That dad-ratted, no-account varmint, killing, just killing, and not even eating what he kills! I hate that! Last year, it was our brood sow. And them dogs asleep right out there in the clearing! There ain't a dog born as smart as that bear, Ma. They could have barked! Anyways, we got meat to eat for a while. Meat now and none this winter. You aiming to get after that bear? I'm aiming to get after him right now. Pa, can I go with you this time? Can I, Pa? Hunting bears is man's work, boy. I can do it. I know I can. Well, don't look to me for mercy do the going get rough. Oh, no, Pa. No, Pa. You ain't taking him! He's got to learn sometime. Jody, turn the new dog loose whilst I hang the stock. Ma, you get my gun and rations. Wise old scaper's changing his direction. He's likely heading for the saw-grass ponds. If'n that's his notion, we can maybe slip round and give him a surprise. You sure can figure what a critter will do. Well, you belong to figure, son. A wild critter's quicker than a man and a heap stronger, but a man's got a mite more sense. He can't outrun a bear, but he's a sorry hunter if he can't outstudy him. Old Slewfoot killed a man once, didn't he, Pa? So they say, boy. Your gun loaded, Pa? I reckon we're getting old Slewfoot pretty tired out, Pa. You won't feel so tired old Slewfoot raise up in front of you. Come on. Looks like that bear's got itself a ticket to Jacksonville. Pa...You'll not be scared when we come up with him, Pa? Not 'less'n things go mighty wrong. I don't reckon you'll be scared, son. No, sir. No, Pa. Pa, if I was to be scared, must I climb a tree? Yes, son. Even you ain't scared, it's a good place to watch the ruckus from. Come on, boy. Don't go getting faintified on me. I feared it. The thicket. They're getting close, boy. Maybe you'd best wait here after all. No, Pa. I ain't scared. Just keep behind me, then. Easy, girl. Easy! Do you reckon he's in there, Pa? He's in there, boy. All right, Julie, get him! He's coming, Pa, he's coming! No, he ain't, boy. He's a-goin'! Perk! Get, perk! Perk! Pa, the new dog's running away! Now, Pa! Pa, what's the matter? Now, boy! You hurt, Pa? You hurt? What happened? Backfired. Julie! Rip! Rip! Here, rip! Rip! Here, rip! This confounded worthless gun! It's Julie, Pa. She'll be all right, boy. We'll make a hammock out of my coat and carry her home. There, Julie. Her breathing's still short. I reckon she's lost a mite of blood. Where you taking her? Jody's room. I'll not be popping in and out of bed all night a-wakin' you. Good night, Ma. Good night. She'll live, won't she, Pa? Huh? I'm certain she will, son. I'm bedding her here. You'd best sleep with me, Pa. That's what I'm figuring on doing, if'n you'll have me. I'll have you, Pa. Now, don't go visiting all night. Get to sleep. Yes, Ma. What makes you so wakeful, son? I can't stop walking. We went a fur piece. How you like going after bear? Well, I like thinking about it. I know. I like the tracking and the trailing, seeing the saplings broke down. But the fighting's right fearsome, ain't it, son? It's mighty fearsome. It's got to be. It's a hard law, but it's the law-- kill or go hungry. I was right proud the way you come along with me, son. Thanks, Pa. You cold, son? I reckon, Pa. Move over a mite. I'll warm you. Well, it's get me a new gun or court trouble. How you aim to get a new gun? Where's the money coming from? Well, Ma, I'm just aiming to trade that there new dog of ours for one. You said he were no-account. He ain't much good on a bear hunt, that's a fact, but you know as good as I do them forresters is fools for dogs. Ezry Baxter, you go tradin' with them thieving rascals, you do good to come home with your britches. They're a reckless, no-account, black-hearted lot. Lower than a doodlebug, every one of them. Fodderwing ain't. Fodderwing's my friend. A fine friend. Crazy as a loon. He ain't crazy, Ma. He's just... Different. Anyways, that's where me and Jody's a-headin'. Get that worthless dog untied, Jody. Will you want a tote lunch? Why, I'd not insult my neighbors that-a-way. What you thinking, son? I ain't thinking. Just a-feelin' the sun and listening to the birds and looking round? That's what I'm doing, Pa. That's right, son. You glad you going to see fodderwing? I like fodderwing. Well, I guess he can't do you no harm if'n you don't take his talk too serious. Fodderwing wouldn't want to do nobody no harm. He ain't crazy like Ma said he is at all, Pa. Well, he ain't to blame for hatching out peculiar. I guess he was the second settin'. We're there, Pa. I can see smoke coming out of the chimney. Here, perk. Here, perk. Come on, boy. Come on. Is he hurted? Nope. Then what are we toting him for? Oh, I just don't want anything to happen to him, that's all. Well, boy... Sounds like we're here. You ain't got no call to say that! I know who it was. It was major. I seen it myself! Don't you go sayin' that! Was either major or Lem's old Sophie. You say it was Sophie and I'll bust you wide-open. Shut up! You're worse than the dogs. If it weren't so hot, I'd flail every one of you myself. You hear what your Pa says? Now, you shut your noise! Look out there, Ma. You're gonna hurt somebody one of these days. Why, look a-there! It safe for a fella to get down? If it ain't old penny Baxter. Howdy, penny. What's the matter with your dog? Get down and come on in. Fodderwing will be right glad to see you, Jody. You gonna get down off that there horse or we gotta help you? Bring the horse right in with you. How's your old woman, penny? Ain't complainin' none. Hey, buck. How's your corn coming? Corn's good. I ain't never seen such a corn-raiser as old penny Baxter. You good-for-nothin' scapers don't know what corn is. Hey! Hey. I got me a new baby coon. A coon? Let's go see him, huh? My eagle died. He was too wild to pen. I'd never catch me nothin' with wings again. Why? If'n you had wings, what would you do? You'd fly with them, wouldn't you? You wouldn't never come down again, would you? I reckon not. Nothing that has wings should ever come down again. You never did try to fly again, did you? I tried to fly too young. That's push. You remember him. Hey, push. Hey! They won't raise no young 'uns. Lem says they's brothers. Here's the coon. Here, racket. Ain't he a thing? If'n I should get me another one, you can have one, too. I--I'd be proud to have one, but Ma won't let me keep nothin'. Oliver said he'd bring me a monkey from the south seas, but Ma said she had enough monkeys around the place as it 'tis. She meant Pa and me. Where is Oliver now? Sailing somewheres on the sea. I'd never go to sea. They ain't got no animals on the sea. I might go to sea someday, if'n I could go with Oliver. Oliver's my friend. I got 3 friends-- Oliver and Pa and you. I got lots of friends. He's eating me! He ain't hungry. He just wants to be doing something. He likes you, Jody. Guess so. He sleeps with me. I sleep up there now. Buck made it for me. If'n you can stay the night, you can sleep up there with me. Do you like to sleep up there? You see things at night and hear things. What? All the things that's scared of the daytime. I seen a deer and a wolf playing together. You couldn't have seen that. They's enemies. That's what folks tell you. And I seen the Spaniards riding on big black horses. They's tall and dark and has shiny helmets. But there ain't no Spaniards left. They all gone, like the Indians. They's here. You listen to me. The next time you go to your sinkhole-- you know that big magnolia with the dogwood round it? Well, just you look behind it, and there's always a Spaniard on a big black horse riding past that magnolia. Guess we'd better go in. Well, Jody and me set out after them dogs. That bear took them across the south scrub, along the saw-grass ponds, and through the thicket, and finally right to the edge of Juniper creek, where they caught up with him. Tarnation! Get on with it! This here dog go with them? Yes, he went along. Do he track good? Do he hold the bear at bay? No. He's mighty sorry. That's the sorriest bear dog I ever owned or followed. Got itself lame, huh? No. No, he ain't lame, as I know. Well, then, what you holding him so careful for? Keep him out of the jaws of them bloodhounds of your'n if they should come in. Valuable, huh? Shut up, Lem! Get on with the story! Well, there he was, right smack at the edge of Juniper creek, and rarin' up on his hind legs. Well, I'm just goin' to shoot him, and old Julie gets him by the throat. Finally he pushes her off, and I get a chance to shoot at him, and what happens? What? Get on with it! My gun wouldn't shoot. Tried it again and again, but she just won't shoot, and there I am-- old Julie's getting killed and rip's getting slashed, and this dog no good, and my old muzzleloading shotgun no good, and I'm in a pure fix. Quit that there stopping all the time. Tell us what happened? Just as I try the gun for the last time, she hangfires on me-- knocks me down, and there I am. That makes old Slewfoot decide he's had enough. He turns, he starts for the creek, swims to the other side, and the last we seen of him, he's heading for no man knows where. I'd've give a gallon of whiskey to have been there! That bear's too smart for his own good. I'd choke him to death. That old Slewfoot is something. You're a liar, penny Baxter. Ain't no man ever said that of me afore, Lem. Just 2 dogs don't make a bear like old Slewfoot turn tail and run. How come you never once mentioned this dog you got here? Now, don't press me, Lem. I done told you, the dog is worthless. I notice he come out in mighty good shape. Not a mark on him, is there? No, no, there's nary a mark. Takes a might clever dog to fight a bear and not get no scratch on him. Ah, he's no good, Lem. I wouldn't want you to get no idea of trading for him, because you'd get fooled and cheated. Simmer down, Lem. If'n penny don't want to trade, they ain't nothing say he got to. Where's your manners, Lem, drinking all that jug? Where's your'n, not giving company a chance to wet their whistles afore dinner? Pa, you got the most sense for such a old buzzard. It don't take no sense to crave liquor. Give it here. Pour me a noggin in the cup, and you can all set down. If I'd a-known you was a-comin', I'd have cooked something fittin'. All this here looks fine enough for the governor. I reckon you folks give thanks, penny. Pa, it won't hurt you none to ask blessing for once in your life. Oh, lord... Oh, lord... We...We... Oh, lord, thou has seen fit to bless our sinnin' souls and...And bellies with... With, uh... With, uh... With... Good vittles again. Amen. Thanks, penny. Amen. I want two things, penny Baxter. I want to be in at the death of old Slewfoot, and I want that there dog. Mind what you do, Lem. When I want a thing, I get it. Right from England. No muzzleloading. Fill your own shells. Easy as spittin'. Stick your shells in, breech her, cock her, and you're ready for anything. 2 shots, as true as the eagle flies. Now, take the gun for him, or by thunder, I'll-- well, I-- I don't figure to get myself murdered in my tracks, if that's the way it stands, Lem. I...Uh... Well, you got to promise not to beat the puddin' out of me after you hunted him. Shake. You scapers got enough covers up there? Yes, Ma. Yes'm. Good night. Night. Night, Ma. Night. And then what happened? 'Twere a bright, sunny day, like this'n we just had. And you went right to the edge of the roof? I went to the edge of the roof. And then you jumped? I jumped way out in the air. What did it feel like? When I was jumping, it felt just like I were flying, for a minute-- just like a bird, and then it went kind of dark. 'Twere dark for quite a time. Was you bad hurted? I reckon. It should have worked. I were too young. Someday I'll fly. I'll just fly on and on. It'll be easier than walking. Walking ain't easy for me since I tried to fly. Guess near about everything like to fly. Birds fly... Birds and angels. You know what the end of the world's like, Jody? What? It's empty and dark with only clouds to ride on... But the clouds is sunny and soft, and you just float on them and go nowheres. And all the animals has little bright clouds to ride on. Racket will have a little one just alongside of mine. And you know what, Jody? Sometimes, as you're drifting along, you just sort of drift right inside another cloud, and you'll be on that one, and we'll lie there and talk together, just like we're talking now. And you know what, Jody? What? Clouds are really just the backs of angels who are flying around up there looking after things. They'll look after you, too, Jody, till you're ready to fly. How you know that? I just know. Could be. Yeah. Could be. Pa! Pa! Pa! I can see him, Pa, I can see him! An old Spaniard riding along. Fodderwing said I could spy him here. That's nice. What'd he say he seed? A Spaniard. What Spaniard? I don't know. Hmm. There, now. I was scared this wouldn't stand another washing. What else you got that's cool to wear? Nothing, excusing my wedding dress. That black alpaca is nice. That went to pieces 3 years ago-- went to pure rags doing work just like this. Toting washing to a sinkhole half a mile from the house, toting water to wash in, toting water to cook in-- you'll get your well one day, Ory, and right outside your door. I'll believe it when I see it. After all these years of waiting, I'll take no stock in it. Ory, I think me and Jody will make us a trip to Volusia. Yeah. I got some trading I want to do. Ain't it exciting just to see it, Pa? Yes, I must say, once in a while it's a pleasure to see a town. Get along, Caesar. It'll be right nice seeing your sweetheart again, won't it? Pa, you know I ain't got no sweetheart. You ain't going back on eulalie after I seed you holding hands at the doin's last Christmas? I was not holding hands. It was a game they was playing. If you say that again, Pa, I'll just die. All right. Just wanted to get it straight. Hello there, Mr. ranger! Hello, Mr. ranger. Who's there? Customers. Hi there, penny Baxter. Hiya, Jody. Hello, Mr. ranger. I was just getting all set to noon. You stay right where you are. Sorry we woke you up. Ha ha ha! 'Tain't nothing. I'll catch up with it later. Well... Looky there who's in town. Hiya, fellas! How'd that there dog I swapped you come out? Say that again, penny. I said how'd you come out with that sorry dog I traded you? We ain't laughin' none about it. You ain't mad about it? I ain't sayin' what I am. You'd best keep out of Lem's way. Lem in town with you fellers? He's with us, but he's out courtin' that twink weatherby of his'n. She's Oliver's girl. Just don't let Lem hear you say that, young'un. I'm right sorry Lem feels that way about the trade. You just told him the truth. My words was straight. My intentions was as crooked as the ocklawaha river. Yes, sir, the steamboat captain has been asking about you, Mr. Baxter. Says these city folks traveling up and down the river is just hollering for venison. What's next? Uh...2 boxes 12-Gauge brass shell cases. 2 boxes 12-Gauge brass shell cases. Yes, sir, just hollering for it, he says, and it ain't half as good as pork. Now, you and me, we know it. What's next? Uh...One pain curer. One pain curer. Yes, sir, as I says to my nephew, I says, "Oliver, you're just as well--" Oliver in town? Oliver?! Oliver back? Where'd he go to this long time? To hear him tell, he's traveled the seven seas. You reckon he saw any whales this time, Pa? Where is he? Where's Oliver? The sailor? He's out with his gal, twink weatherby. But millwheel said she's Lem's girl. Never mind, Jody. Don't you bother your head about that. Well, that just about completes it. You figure that up. I'm looking to have a little cash left over-- aiming to buy tobacky seed for the spring for a money crop, and with that money, I'm aiming to buy brick and mortar so as we can have a well right outside our very door. What do you think of that, Mr. Boyles? That'll be fine for Mrs. Baxter. What's this here stuff? Black alpacky, ain't it? Yeah, that's what it is. That's what I thought. Appears to me I sold Mrs. Baxter a dress length of that alpacky long about 4 or 5 summers back. Huh? That's pretty. Young man, you don't come in to trade very often, so I'll treat you to a dime's worth of anything you have a notion for. I reckon that mouth organ's worth more than a dime. Well, yes, but it's been here a long while. Take it and welcome. Well, now, that's unusual kind. Thank you, sir. There's your gal now, Jody. Pa... It's eulalie, come out special just to see you. Pa... Now, go say how-do to her. Go on. Your boy's got manners, Mr. Baxter. Oh, he's right smart of a comfort. Aah! He hit me with a potato! Jody, you put that down! What's got into you? How come you do shame me like that? Now, you go up and excuse yourself. Jody! Right smart lot of spunk your boy's got, Mr. Baxter. Thank you, Mr. Boyles. We'll be back later for our things. Pa, Pa, quick! They killing Oliver! He's fighting Lem and all the forresters together! They killing him! Then whose girl is twink weatherby-- Lem's or Oliver's? I guess they can't decide. Then who are we fighting for? For whoever's taking a licking-- that'll be Oliver. But the forresters is our friends, too. Who's judging this fight? We're judging it. If it takes 3 men to whip one, I say the one man's the best. Hello, Oliver, welcome home. Oliver! Jody! Oh! Am I glad to see you, old landlubber, you. I brought you back a present from China. Saw a lot of whales, too. Oliver! I got no mind to kill you, penny Baxter, but I'll smash you flatter'n a Skeeter you don't get out of my way. We'd have fought him one at a time, but he led right in. I'll fight any man anywhere what says what Lem said about my gal. Then I'll say it again. I ain't seen a fight as good as this for months. Reckon I'll get in it, too. Coming? Might as well. Jody, get out of this! Get off, you little-- I'm back, Ma. What happened to you? We got in a fight. Who did? Me and Pa and the forresters and Oliver. They was beating him bad. They couldn't decide whether Oliver's girl was Lem's or-- now, ain't that just fine? Where's your Pa? Ahem. I'm here. Well, ain't that just fine. Now, did I make a good trade, Ma? That makes near $5.00 we got saved, and you know what that money's going for? Tobacky seed-- enough tobacky seed so's we can have a fine money crop next spring, and every bit of money we get from that is going into bricks and mortar so's you can have your new well right outside your door. Well, I declare. I just can't imagine it-- washing right on my own place, having all the water I need right here, not even caring if some slops over now and then. Being able to waste a whole bucket of nice, cold water just to cool myself with. I declare, it will be such a blessing, it won't seem natural. I bet you ain't bought half the things I ordered. I never knowed a man yet that could be trusted to... Where's my paregoric? Where's my-- now, if that ain't just like a man! Throwing away money on such as this. I declare, men ain't got no more sense than... How much did this cost? You just tell me how much money you wasted on such foolishness. The next time you go to Volusia, I'll-- how much did this cost? She's a-rarin', Pa. Don't she like it? She likes it, boy. Giddyup. Fodderwing claims he can talk to vultures. Well, they wouldn't have much I'd want to hear. Maybe if'n you was to tame one, it might make a pretty nice pet. Whoa, Caesar. Whoa. Well, Ma, been admiring our fine crop of corn? I ain't admiring nothin'. You know why them hogs didn't come in last night? Why? They were stole. Stole? They was baited. Look here. I was getting ti-ti leaves on the other side of the sinkhole, and I seed corn scattered and hog tracks 'side it. They come and took 'em. Who had, Ma? That ain't hard to guess. Them fine friends of yours. Forresters? Them black-hearted, thieving-- Jody, fetch me my gun. Lookit, Pa! So that's what they done-- trapped them. They had a cart, Pa. And that track leads plain as anything right to the forresters. Dogged if I can understand cold-out meanness. Well, boy, we're obliged to follow. Lem said he'd shoot you if we come around. I'd rather let him keep the hogs. And go without meat? How you expect we're going to live if'n we don't protect our rations? You want to beg off going? I reckon not, Pa. I reckon I'll go with you. All right, then. If there's trouble waiting for you, you'd just as good go to meet it. Pa! Get back! Watch the dogs! Pa! He got me, boy. He's a big'un. Get the gun. Pa, it's a Doe! You do as I tell you now. Take your knife and open up her belly. What am I to do? Cut out the liver and the heart. Maybe we got a chance this-a-way. Hurry, boy! Hurry, boy! Pa, you'll bleed to death! I'd rather bleed to death than swell. I seed a man die. I can feel it draw. Do it hurt, Pa? Like a hot knife. Give me the heart, boy. Pa, the Doe's got a Fawn. Sorry, boy. I can't help it. Now, listen, boy, I got to make for home. I hate to ask it of you, but you get on to the forresters. Get one of them to ride to the branch for doc Wilson. It's my only chance. Can you do it? I can do it, Pa. Call out to them quick sayin' I'm snakebit afore they chunk something at you, maybe shoot. I can do it! Just keep out of Lem's way. Better get one of them to take this road to our place and pick me up in case I can't make it. And hurry, boy. You'll make it, Pa! You hear me? You're obliged to make it! Fodderwing! Fodderwing! What do you want, you little varmint? Pa. Pa, he's snakebit. What kind of snake? A rattler-- A big'un! Where'd it get him? In the arm. Is it swellin'? It's bad swelled already. Please ride for doc Wilson. Please ride for him quick. Please! Please! I'll ride for him. I sure thank you, millwheel. Spare your thanks. I'd help a dog was snakebit. I'll ride and pick up penny. Walking's bad for a man that's snakebit. Pa. Oh, Pa. Old death got to wait a while on me. Pa... Doc. Hey, doc! Hmm? What? Look at Pa. Lord of the jaybirds, he made it. He's dead. Not by a longshot. He's pulled through. You sound like you're sorry. I could sleep for a week. That's just what I want you to do. Pa... Well, he sure ain't pretty, but by thunder, he's alive. I woke up fixing to go help bury him. How he done it without whiskey, I don't know. How come you'd be out of it, doc? I was finishing my last jug when you rode up. How was I to know somebody was to go and get snakebit? Thank you, Ma'am. Jody, you finished? Take this warm milk in to your Pa, and mind you, don't spill none of it. Now, did I have me a real good snort, I'd be pretty nigh satisfied. 'Twere a near thing, Pa. You all right now, though. That's right. I'm proud the way you kept your head and done what was needed. What's the matter, boy? Pa, you recollect that Doe you shot? Can't never forget her. Most likely she saved your life, didn't she, Pa? She saved me. That's certain. Pa, you recollect that little Fawn she had? Yes, boy? Most likely it's mighty scared and lonesome and hungry. I reckon so. It might be out there yet, not knowing which way to go. Might be. It won't take much to raise it, Pa. It'll soon get to where it can make out on leaves and acorns. Dogged if you don't figure the farthest of any young'un I ever knowed. We taken its mammy, and it weren't no ways to blame. It don't seem grateful to let it starve, do it? Pa, Pa, you figure I ought to go out and see can I find him? And tote it here? Tote it here and raise it. Pa... Boy, you got me hemmed in. You tell your Ma I said you was to go get it. Hey, Pa. Hey, doves! It's me. It's me--Jody. Well... I'm proud you found him. He weren't scared of me. He was laying right where his mammy made his bed. Look, Ma. I found him. So I see. It'll take milk for a long while. I don't know as I'd have give my consent if I'd knowed it was so young. He ain't so young. Is he, Pa? Ory, I got one thing to say, and then I'll have no more talk about it. The little Fawn's as welcome in this house as Jody. It's his'n, and we'll raise it without grudgement of milk or meal. You got me to answer to do I ever hear you quarreling about it. This is Jody's Fawn, just like Julie's my dog. I only said it 'twas young. All right. So it 'tis. Now, don't you bother about him at all, Ma. I'll tend to every little thing that needs tending to. He won't be a mite of trouble to you. Ha ha ha! Fooled you! Hey, wait for me! Come on! Come on! Come on. I'll race you! Hey, Ma, you want to see him butt? Lookit, Ma. Did you see him, Ma? I seed him. Look at him this-a-way, Ma. Ain't his eyes pretty? They can see mischief too far. Well, ain't he got a cute foolish tail? Lookit, Ma! All deer's tails look the same. You want to pet him, Ma? You can. I ain't petting no fawns. Got to get a name for him, Pa. I've studied and I've studied, and I can't think of one that's good enough for him. Appears to me you think more of that Fawn than you think of your Pa. Oh, Pa... But I just got to. I've got to get something special. Why don't you call him rover? Ma, rover's a dog's name. Well, call him Joe, then. Ma! Joe Baxter? Sounds like a man. The boy's right. He's got to get him a special name. You know who'd get me a good name for him, Pa? Who's that, boy? Fodderwing. Fodderwing's ailing, buck said. Oh, but he'd just love to see my little Fawn, and he gives wonderful names. He'll get you a name. He's got a ear for such things, the way some folks got an ear for fiddle music. Can I, Ma? Can I? All I know is, my voice don't mean nothing around here. Oh, Ma. Jody! What? You got to quit sleeping with that Fawn. Just don't you be impatient, now. You think you're mighty biggity 'cause you can get into bed without having to undress. Get over. I want to explain something to you. Pretty soon, we're going over to see fodderwing, and he's gonna give you a name. You're gonna like fodderwing. And I want you to behave real manly in front of him so's he'll take to you. You and me and... You hear that? That's a wolf. Do you ever hear a noise like that, you get in the house as quick as you can. Do you hear any noises that is animals, you just start running and bleating so's I'll hear you. You listening to me? Huh? I don't know what ails Ma. You smell just fine. Come on. This here's where fodderwing lives. Stand still. Look nice so fodderwing will put a name to you. Fodderwing always shows me his pets. Now I've got something to show him. Come on. Fodderwing! Fodderwing! Maybe they's all asleep. Fodderwing, it's Jody. I got me something. Come to see fodderwing. Come to show him my Fawn. I come special. He's dead. But I come to see him. You come too late. I'd have fetched you if there'd have been time. There wasn't time enough to fetch old doc. One minute he was breathing, and the next minute he just wasn't, like as if you'd blowed out a candle. You can come look at him. I lost my boy-- my poor crookedy boy. He'll not hear, but speak to him. Hey. I knowed you'd hate it fearful. I wished he could have seen your Fawn. I told him about it. He talked a lot about it. He said, "Jody's got him a brother." That's how come we to be here. I come for fodderwing to name him. He did name him. He said, "a Fawn has a little white flag. "His tail is a little white flag. If I had a Fawn, I'd name him flag." He said, "flag the Fawn is what I'd call him." Flag. Flag the Fawn. Penny, you've had a Christian raising. We'd be proud that you say something. O lord, almighty god, it ain't for us ignorant mortals to say what's right and what's wrong. If it was any one of us to be doing it, we'd not have made this poor boy into a cripple. But, lord, in a way of speaking, you made it up to him. You give him a way with the wild critters. You give him a sort of wisdom, made him knowing and gentle. And now you've seen fit to take him where being crookedy in mind or limb don't matter. But, lord, it pleasures us to think now you've straightened out them legs. It pleasures us to think on him walking around as easy as anyone. And, lord, give him a few redbirds and maybe a squirrel or a coon to keep him company like he had here. All of us is somehow lonesome, and we know he'll not be lonesome do he have them little wild things around him, if it ain't asking too much to put a few varmints in heaven. Thy will be done. Amen. What's all this? You can't leave them out in a storm like this. They'd get blowed clean off the place, Ma. You keep them out of my way. Why didn't you let in the cow and old Caesar and have everything to suit you? We could let in old Slewfoot if'n we could find him. Pa, when are we gonna hunt old Slewfoot again? Jody, you're wet to the skin. What you thinking of? I've got to dry flag. Look how good he shines up. Get out of them wet clothes. Ain't it nice here in the wind and the rain and us in here safe and cozy? That's right, son. Maybe we'll be able to tell a few tales tonight. How'd you like that, Jody? Hey, Pa! Maybe your Ma will tell us a tale. Hey, Ma? I might. Hey, Ma! Well, uncle miles looked at them 2 bear cubs and he says, "I'm going to catch me one of them," so he did, but he didn't have nothing to tote it in. Uncle miles, being from Georgia, had on long underdrawers. So he taken them off, tied knots in the legs, and made him a sack. Now, he put'n the cub in it, and just as he's reaching for his britches to put 'em on again, here comes a-woofin' and a-crashin', and that she-bear come out of the thicket right at him. Jody, boy, fetch me my pipe, son. Oh, Pa. What you grinning at? Oh, nothing. I look all right? You look just dandy, sweetheart. Thank you, boy. Well, sir, he take him down through the swamp and dropped the cub, and the old mammy, she gathered it up drawers and all, but she's so close behind uncle miles, she stepped on a vine, and it tripped him and throwed him flat amongst the thorns and brambles. Now, aunt moll was a kind of muddle-minded woman, and she never could make out how he come home without his drawers on a cold day and his bottom scratched. But uncle miles always said that weren't nothing to the puzzling that mammy bear must have done over them drawers on her cub. Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! Oh, Pa, you got all them tales in your mind and don't tell them. I ain't much for dogs, but there was a dog once I'd taken a notion to. She had the prettiest coat. I said to the feller owned her, "when she finds pups, I'd like one." He says, "well, you're welcome, but you ain't got no way of hunting." I wasn't yet married to your Pa. "A hound will die," he says, "if it ain't hunted." "Is she a hound?" Says I. He says, "yes'm." I said, "then I sure don't want one, for a hound will suck eggs." Well... Well, now, that's a mighty exciting tale, Ma. You got any more like that'un? I might. You reckon it's fixing to do damage? Rotted. Most of them rotted-- our whole crop. Keep turning them so's they all get a mite of heat. Most of these beans is moldy. 6 days of rain. We'd just as good to quit fighting and lay down and die! Well, job taken worse punishment. That's right. Find the good in it! Get out of that, you dad-ratted varmint! Ma! Ma, don't hit him again! That ends it! That critter gives me no peace day or night. He can't come in this house no time, never no more! He's just hungry, Ma. He ain't had much. You lock him up in the barn! If he gets in my way once again-- leave off, the both of you! Ain't it enough to have trouble pouring on us out of the skies without the family quarreling? Has a man got to die to find peace? What's happening now? Seems like... Shh! Pa! It stopped! Ma, it seems like at times a body gets struck down so low, ain't a power on earth can ever bring him up again. Seems like something inside him dies so he don't even want to get up again. But he does. Ain't much of a world left for us, Ory, but it's all we got. Let's be thankful we got any world at all. Here comes the sun. Hey, Ma! Look at this day! If I was dead, I'd sit up and notice on a day like this. Just right for corn, just right for okry, just right for tobacky, cowpeas, 'taters, Greens. Hey, Ma! We got us a planting Pa, ain't we? Hear him tell it, you'd think he's fixing to plant the world. I'd purely love to. Come on, boy. We gonna do all that planting, we best keep busy. Now, you see, when these here tobacky plants come up, we won't have to tote water no more. Ma's gonna have a well, right outside her door. Pa give us a lot of chores today. There. Now we're all done. Come on. You sit in the doorway. Hey, Pa. Was that Jody already? What if it was? Now stand still. You'll bust one of these seams. Stand still, I tell you. You want I should spoil it? I done all the hoeing you told me to do, Pa. All right, all right. And I got the tobacky plants watered. That's good, boy. Anything else I should do, Pa? I guess not. That's sure mighty pretty, Pa. I'll pretty you with a piece of fat wood! You get out of here! Can I bring flag in to see how pretty it looks? You gonna get a-- stand still! You said you'd be through afore he got home. Jody's got to learn someday how dresses is made. Well, not on me, he don't. 'Sides, I'm getting feverish. Well, fight it a minute and turn around. How you think I'm gonna get this done in time for the wedding if'n you don't stand still? What wedding, Ma? Who's getting married? Oliver's getting married. Oliver? And that ain't the worst of it, boy. They're going to Boston to live. You mean we ain't gonna see Oliver no more? No, I'm afraid not, boy. Now, tomorrow, I'm going to Oliver's wedding. After they're married, they're going off to Boston to live. So we'll be kind of alone. You got to take care of yourself while I'm away. You got to be good. You understand? I've been doing some figuring. You're getting kind of big. Now, I don't care for girls, and I don't never aim to get married, but when you get a little bigger, maybe you're gonna want a Doe. So someday I'm fixing to build a house down by the Glen, and I'm gonna get you a Doe. We're all gonna live there together by the Glen. Would you like that? Huh? Me living with you? See? I'm gonna take care of you fine. Now good night. It's right nice seeing a lot of people again and all the buildings and stores. My, how it's growed. That that house never used to be there. That house been built over a year, Ma. Ma don't get out enough. I don't, and that's the truth. How do you do? Why, how do, Mrs. Saunders? How do, Mrs. Saunders? She won't recollect me. How do you do, Mrs. Baxter? Howdy do? Well, I declare. Well, best get going. Bye, penny. Jody and me will miss you, Oliver. You miss me enough to come down to Boston to visit? I'll come visit you, Oliver. I want to thank you for sticking by me in the fight. I'll never forget you. Not even down in the China sea. Good-bye, eulalie. Be a good, sweet little gal and maybe look after Jody for me, huh? Bye, Mrs. Baxter. Good-bye. Good-bye, Jody. Shall I kiss you good-bye, Jody? Well, I guess it wouldn't hurt nothing. Come on. You'll miss the boat! Come on, honey. We'll miss the boat. Bye! Bye! Bye! Bye! Bye, twink! Bye, Oliver! Bye, twink! Bye! Bye, Oliver! Bye, twink! Bye, twink! I don't like folks going away. It's like they was dying, the way fodderwing done. That's life, boy-- getting and losing. Losing and getting. I'm glad I got flag. Ha ha ha! Flag! Flag, stop that. Oh, flag! You'll knock this milk over. He missed me, Pa. Old flag sure missed me yesterday. He just tags after me like a dog. Just like your old-- what's happened, Pa? We've been saving a long time to get enough extra to set out them tobacky seeds, ain't we, boy? It 'tweren't flag done it, Pa. 'Tweren't flag. 'Twere flag. That won't do no good, boy. He's ruined half the crop. But flag didn't mean it, Pa. Ma, listen. Flag didn't mean it, Ma. Listen, Ma! Ma! Ma! Pa. She figured at last she was gonna get her well dug. That's why she don't feel like talking. But flag didn't mean it, Pa. I don't figure he done it malicious. He was just racing back and forth, and it was something to jump on. What you looking at him that-a-way for, Pa? He's a yearling now, for sure. You think a heap of him, don't you, boy? Why, sure. Yes, you're a pair of yearlings now. It grieves me. What did you do that for? You're a yearling now. You're growed up. You got to be good. I can do that, Pa. I know just how. No, we'll do it together, boy. There's a good few he ain't touched, Pa. You think we still got enough to get Ma her well dug? I'm afraid not, boy. But I got a little idea. What do you say we clear out that field down behind the garden. There's a few big stumps there. If'n we can get them out pretty soon, we might plant ourselves some cotton. Pa! A money crop, so's your Ma can still get her well. Hey, Pa, we can do it! We can do it! Git up, Caesar. Go on, git up! Git up. Go on, git up, git up. Git up, Caesar. Git up. Git up. Git up. Git up, Caesar. Git up, git up. This is the last one, Pa. Where do you figure we best dig Ma her well? We best get this field of cotton afore we figure on that. Now, git up, Caesar! Go on! Git up, now! Git up! What's the matter, Pa? It's all right. I'll be all right in a minute. I reckon I strained myself. I'll get Ma. No! I'll be all right. Unhitch Caesar. I'll ride him in. You don't never know when to quit. If you had a mite of sense... You more than likely ruptured yourself. Please to hush, Ory. Is it easier, Pa? Oh, it feels mighty good laying down this way. Hardly feel it at all. You're obliged to take it easy for a spell. I reckon. If it so happens that I ain't out of bed for a few days, you think you can take charge of things around here? I can take charge, Pa. You know what belongs to be done. The cowpeas will need hoeing. I'd best watch the corn for cutworms, and-- you know as good as I do, you've got to keep that yearling out of the field. I'll keep him out, Pa. That's fine. You keep him out... Religious. Yes, sir. I'll just take charge of everything. You best get to bed now. You've got a lot to do tomorrow. You get a good sleep, too, Pa. Got to get your strength back. All right, son. Good night, Pa. Good night, son. Your Pa asleep? He's getting asleep. You best get to bed, too, Ma. What's that? I said, you best get to bed. Now, Mr. impudent bigmouth, you just get to your room. Yes, Ma'am. Some people getting mighty important around here. Yes'm. Good night. Good night. Lookit, Pa. These here is for your supper. And I only wasted 2 shots. That's mighty fine, son. I'm taking charge, all right, ain't I, Pa? Everything's coming along just fine. The corn is the best I ever seed, and-- what's the matter, Pa? When did you see the corn last, Jody? Yesterday. It were fine. It's pretty near an inch high. Your Ma here says... She says something has et it. Et the corn? She says nigh about the whole crop is gone. But that ain't right. Yesterday it was all right. It appears like something must have et it during the night. Flag ain't et it, Ma. Flag et it. No, Ma, he couldn't have. He's been bein' good. He wouldn't eat the corn. He ain't never et nothing he shouldn't have. Go and see! And that settles it. That deer has got to go! It were flag. I reckon. Yes, sir. But he won't ever do it again, Pa. I'm a-gonna punish him. I'll whip him. I'll whip him with a stick, Pa. He ain't never been whipped before, Pa, but I could do it-- you don't think whipping's gonna help nothing? Th-then I'll pen him up, Pa. We got no earthly place to pen up a wild thing like that. Then--then I'll halter him. I'll tie him by the legs and let him kick and plunge and then-- now wait a minute, boy. Just listen to me. Yes, sir. Yes, Pa. I'm listening. What's happened is powerful bad. You know that. Yes, sir. But your Ma and me has come to an agreement. We're gonna have a try at a remedy. I take it you're willing to work extra hard to fix things? Oh, Pa, I'd just do anything! I'll work like you never seed, Pa. I'll do anything you say! All right, all right. First you go down to the crib and get whatever corn we got left. Then you plant it, just like we done before. Then you start to work and build our fence up high. When you get it higher than you can reach, I hope I'll be able to help you by that time. But you got to get it all up before the corn starts showing again! And maybe that way we're safe. You understand, boy? You can depend on me, Pa. Soon as I get the corn planted, you're gonna get shut in the barn till the fence is up. Whoa. Whoa. Jody. I'm proud to see you working so hard, boy. But even the yearling, as much as you think of her, ain't worth killin' yourself over. I ain't killin' myself, Pa. I ain't killin' myself. I'd give a year of my life to be where I could help you with this. I can do it all right, Pa. I can do it. We done it, Ma! We done it! Hey, Ma! Well, never mind squeezing the life out of me. I sure thank you for helping me, Ma. I never figured you had it in you to work this-a-way. I declare, it looks as if we're going to have a crop after all. And a fence, Ma! Ain't it wonderful? Well...Let's go and tell your Pa we're done. He'll be mighty proud. Jody. Come here... Close to me. You know we depend on our crops to live. Don't we? Yes, sir. We can't go on having them destroyed, one after the other. No, sir. And you know there ain't a way in the world to keep that wild yearling from destroying them. Yes, sir. I'm sorry. I can't never tell you how sorry. But all's been done was possible. Take the yearling out in the woods and tie him and shoot him. Pa. Pa. You got to go away, flag. You got to go away and never come back. You're growed up now. You got to go out and find yourself a Doe. Can't all live together like I planned. You've been bad... Without meaning to be. You can make out by yourself, can't you? You'll be all right. You're smart. Besides, I don't-- don't care for you no more. You ain't cute like you used to be when you was little. That's right. You go now. Ain't nobody got any use for you around here anymore! Go on, you hear me? You go! There ain't nothin' more I can do to save you! Go on! You're gonna get killed you stay around here! Get out afore I have to shoot you! And don't you never come back! Don't you never! How come you not to do what I told you? I couldn't. I just couldn't, Pa. Tell your Ma to come here. Go to your room and shut the door. Yes, sir. Pa says you're to go to him. Ohh! I didn't mean to hurt the critter. I can't shoot straight. You know I can't! Flag! Jody! You got to finish him, boy. You got to put him out of his torment. You done it on purpose! You always hated him! You went back on me! You told her to do it! I hate you! I hope you die! I hope I never see you again! It's me, flag. It's me... Jody. Jody! Jody! Flag... Flag. Ma. I'm hungry, Ma. I'm hungry. What's out there? Something ahead. What is it? Reverse engines! Lower away the aft boat! Wonder what he was doing on the river. Skinny little runt, ain't he? Try him on something to eat. He ain't come to yet. I'll get him some soup. Pa. Pa! Take it easy, kid. He's feverish, ain't he? He's waking up. Well, young'un, what's the matter? We about run you down in the dark. You hungry, boy? Hungry? Hey there. Not-- Not too fast. Ory? It's me. It's Jody. Jody. Come close. Boy, we near about give you out. You all right? You all right. You ain't dead and a-gone. You all right. Glory be. I had to come home. Why, sure you did. I ain't meant what I said, about hating you. Why, sure you ain't. When I was a child, I spake as a child. Where's Ma? She drove the wagon down to doc Wilson's. Your Ma's been searching for you for 3 days. She ain't done nothing else. She'll be mighty glad you're home. Jody, I'd be proud to know where you been. I've been on the river. I aimed to go to Boston. I see. Were you hungry? I didn't get nothing to eat for 3 days. I'm sorry you had to learn it that-a-way. And now you know. Old starvation-- he's got a face meaner than old Slewfoot. It's fearful. Sit, boy. You figured I went back on you. That's why you dunner away. Son, there's a thing every man's got to know. Maybe you know it already. 'Twa'n't only me. 'Twa'n't only your yearling deer having to be destroyed. Boy, life goes back on you. Yes, sir. I reckon. Now, you've seed how things go in the world of men. Every man wants life to be a fine thing, and easy. Well, 'tis fine, son... Powerful fine, but 'tain't easy. I wanted life to be easy for you, easier than it 'twas for me. A man's heart aches seeing his young'uns face the world, knowing they got to get their insides tore out the way his was tore. I wanted to spare you as long as I could. I wanted you to frolic with your yearling. I knowed the lonesomeness be easy for you. But every man's lonesome. What's he to do then? What's he to do when he gets knocked down? Why, take it for his share and go on. I'm ashamed I run off. You're near enough growed to do your choosing, Jody. Maybe you'd crave to go to sea, like Oliver, but I'd be proud did you choose to live here and farm the clearing. I'd be proud to see the day you got a well dug so's no woman here would be obliged to do her washing on the seepage hillside. You willing? I'm willing. Shake. It's food and drink to have you home, boy. Now go to bed and get your rest. I'll sit here and wait for your Ma. Yes, sir. Good night. Good night, Pa. I'll start the corn early in the morning, Pa. Yes, boy. We'll make it, Pa. We'll make out. Yes, boy. Come spring, we'll even go hunting old Slewfoot. Yes, boy. Good night, Pa. Good night, my son. He's done come back, Ezry. He's done come back different. He's taken the punishment. He ain't a yearling no longer. Ezry... I thought I'd lost them all. Ory. Ory. He's done come home. I'll go in and see him. Go on, Ma. Hello, Ma. Hello, son. You home and safe. Yes, Ma. I'm grateful. Now you get to sleep. Night, son. Night, Ma.
