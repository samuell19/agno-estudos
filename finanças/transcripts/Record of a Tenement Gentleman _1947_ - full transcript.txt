So do small human beings who are easily led into the darkness. They still linger in the air. Kind words... joy... ...and sweet concern... It all makes me feel like I'm stabbing you in the back. Believe me, it's not easy. But try to understand, and then leave me. It's harder than dying. If you keep sulking like this, I would rather die... I'm back. But I am... I'm home. Welcome back. - Is somebody here? - No. But I heard you talking... Never mind. You're back early today. Hey, come here! What's up? I found this kid. Where? He followed me from Kudan. - Homeless? - No, he's just got lost. He's from Chigasaki. Can we put him up tonight? Don't bother with him. But I feel sorry for him. Why should we do that? Let someone else do it. Take him to Tane. Can't you put him up? Not me. I hate kids. Do you really? Leave him with Tane. He's a good boy. I don't want to. Take him over there. I see. Come on. Good evening. - Good evening. - Good evening. Hey, come here. Look, Tane, would you like a boy? I picked him up. I want you to take him in. What's this? He followed me from Kudan. And he won't leave. Will you put him up tonight? Why don't you put him up? Tamekichi really doesn't want to. If he doesn't, I won't. Don't say that, he told me to ask you. - Let him stay, will you? - No thanks. Look, I'm asking you... No. I hate children. Come on, have a heart. Look, Mr. Tashiro, it's no joke. - Please! - Wait, Mr. Tashiro! This is no way... Here. Dry it with the fan. I'm in trouble. You've got me in a mess. - What is it? - The boy. He's a nuisance. I won't take care of him anymore. What's wrong? - He wet the bed last night. - Hum? Don't 'Hum' to me. He ruined my good futon. He peed like a horse. What a calamity! Where is Tashiro? He just left. It's all his fault. I'm not keeping the boy. So do something. - Do what? - Send him away, if you wish. I took him for one night, now it's your turn. Don't be silly. Who's being silly, just think! You're responsible, too. Tashiro found him, so you keep him here. Not me, no thank you. Not if he pees like a horse. Why don't you leave him somewhere? Don't be stupid. You do it, then. What a thing to pick up on the street... Let's ask the Kawayoshis. Yes, let them take him, all right? No, we can't. I have lots of work and children. And not enough room... You've got enough room. A nice place with framed pictures. There's no difference having three or four children. It's not the same. How about your place? My place is no good. Why is it no good? Nothing's wrong with it. Let him stay at your place. He could help you. That's right, let him stay. Oh, come on. Tashiro picked up a problem. I guess someone must take him back to Chigasaki. Then, we can find his house. And leave him there. That's the best thing to do. - How about it? - Fine, but I won't do it. - Oh, don't say that. - No, count me out. But someone has to go. Then, you go. - What do you think? - It's a good idea. - Will you go? - Stop fooling around. Tashiro picked up a problem. All right, we'll draw lots. It's fair. No hard feelings. Just bad luck for whoever draws the one. All right. Is it OK, Kawayoshi? - It's all right. - I'll make the lots. The X marks the one. If you get it, you go. It's me. So, it's you. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm getting in deeper. No hard feelings. It's just luck. It's your lucky day. What luck? Oh, come on, how about some tea? You're kidding! Hey, mine's got an X too. That's right. Mine too. Haste makes waste, right? I see. Keep it between us, all right? Of course. Please. It's a long trip, if she finds out, she'll kill us. No, we didn't know them well. He's a carpenter and his house was destroyed. We just rented them a room while he had a job here. He was working in removals but only for about ten days. Is that right... And a couple of days ago, he left with the boy to look for work in Tokyo. Do you think he'll come back? I don't think so. He took everything with him. The removal company might know where he is... I wonder... Here you go. Your father's just mean. You didn't get lost. You were abandoned. Why don't you stay at that house? They'll keep you. Take this, but there's no more. Eat up and go to that house. All right? What's this, now? Get me some shells. I want them for souvenirs. Go on, you're a good kid, go on, hurry. I'll bite you! Fortune, Position of houses, Physiognomy... ...Palmistry. Direction, Matrimony... Life... ...and Luck. Can a fortune-teller really tell? Sure. There's nothing more positive than that. But you went out wearing waterproof boots, and it turned out to be a sunny day. Weather isn't my business. The radio can tell you that. - Welcome back. - Oh, welcome back. I know it was a long trip. Did it go well? No way. His father wasn't there. I wasted my time. The train was full, I got in through a window. The train fare had gone up. Thanks, Tashiro. - Sorry. - What is he carrying? Potatoes. I bought them cheap at the station. I didn't want to come back empty-handed. - Poor boy, he's worn out. - Only a few pounds. Did anyone come? No, nobody. We'll have a regular meeting tonight. - Oh, that's right. - It's starting any minute. Today's a lucky day for Kawayoshi. Why? His son won 2,000 yen in the lottery. Oh. 2,000 yen in new currency. That's not bad at all. Will he treat us tonight? I hope so, too. I'll get rid of the potatoes. Put the potatoes down. You can make a bed, can't you? Go to bed early. And don't wet the bed again. We want you to remain head of our group. - No, let me resign. - Please stay. We will help out but you must be the chief. Don't fight us. Everyone is asking you to stay. - It's all settled then? - Yes, yes. - Well, then, I guess I have to. - Thank you. - That's the final decision. - Thank you. Can I serve up now? Yes, bring it in. This is great! You made so much. This isn't much but... Hey, Hei-chan! Hei-chan, why don't you come here! Congratulations, Hei-chan. And thank you! Hei-chan is great. He's a lucky boy. - He really is. - No... His good attitude brought him luck. Luck falls on pure-minded people. - Does it? - Yes, it does. You can't win if you wanted 2,000 yen. - That's why children win. - Is that so? If you try, you won't win. If I can't, you can't either. That's why I don't do it. But I go to the race track because it depends on the horses. - Please, everyone. - Yes, let's start... Sake for luck, huh? This is the real sake. This is good. Let's drink and have some fun. Thank you! I hear you're good at telling peep-show stories. - No... - Peep? You know... this. You can't judge people by the way they look. I thought you were decent. What are you saying? Remember the peep-shows at fairs? You mean that picture-story show! I loved it so much I got trachome. Not trachome, it's trachoma. Tashiro, sing it. Don't bring that up now... Sing it, Tashiro. Please. - But... - I'd love to hear that. Come on, do it. - Come on, Tashiro, I beg you. - But... "Come and see it, the show is starting!" Well, then... It happened in Tokyo. It's about a naval ensign in the big city. This is a love story, A fragile love floating in the dark. There was a beautiful girl. The first child of the viscount Kataoka. She was like a bud of cherry blossom, Oh, what a beauty! Her name was... ... Namiko Kataoka. She married the ensign, Baron Takeo Kawashima. Their honeymoon was in the mountains in lkaho. And when they were tired of having fun, they went back to their home in Tokyo. But being a military man, the time had come to go to war. He hurried to Zushi to join his crew... The sea was calm on that day. As he was going aboard, Namiko waved from the shore. Crying, she shouted, "Come home as soon as you can!" And she looked at the pale moon, above the pine tree with broken branches. What a... What a tragic... ... love story. - Very good. - You sang it well. It was great. - Weren't you a professional? - Oh, no. Very well done, wonderful. You're embarrassing me. It's true, better than fortune-telling. Can we find any second-hand peep-show gear for sale? We haven't seen any at fairs recently. What a meeting! We could have one every night. - Good night. - Good night. - Good night. - Good night. I had fun. Please sing again. - Well... Good bye. - Good bye. Are you still up? Go to bed. What's wrong? What is it? You're afraid of wetting the bed? Isn't that right? If you do it again, I'll throw you out. - You understand? - Yes. Go to sleep. I'll wake you up during the night. Good night, Grandma. - It's Auntie. - Auntie, good night. Your father's really hard-hearted. A carpenter can find a job anywhere. Feeding a child doesn't take much. He's your own after all. Raising you this far, why desert you now? Your mother died long ago... Your father's a good-for-nothing... You really are a poor kid, what will you do? Fast asleep already? A kid is a kid... Hello there Oh, hello. Please sit down. - Where have you been? - The teacher's place. Grinding wheat? Yes. What was rationed at your place? Flour. - When was that? - Yesterday. White flour. Ah, before I forget. My mother wants a brush. I'm out of them now. She needs it to clean her false teeth. I'll keep one for her next time. Hello. Welcome. It's a nice day. Hello, Mr. Kawayoshi. Have you finished what I asked for? - Well, no... - Day after tomorrow? He's a good dyer but he takes ages. Wait till next year... No, within three or four days. Don't worry. Do a good job. Thank you. - Candles and matches come today. - OK. See you... Tomorrow, flour. I see. Thanks for last night. - Well, excuse me. - Good bye. - Here you go. - I have something nice. I got them at the teacher's. Take one. This is precious, just like the old days. It must be expensive. And it's delicious. The man who sold me a mirror... ...could he find me a rubber hose? - Oh, the man there. - Would you ask him? Sure, but he charges a lot. I have no idea how much others charge... But I made a nice dresser with the mirror he sold me, I see. - Who is this? - I'm in trouble. - Whose child is that? - He's homeless. Either got lost or abandoned... Don't you need a boy? No, I need a rubber hose. Do you know anyone who will take this boy? I've put him up for two nights now. - Come here, son. - Don't waste it. - It's OK. - He won't appreciate it. Come here, son. Come here. Here. What do you have there? Cigarette butts. What will you do with them? Do you smoke? It's for Dad. What else do you have in your pockets? Empty them. I said empty them. Nails. Filthy kid. Now, go away! His father? A Carpenter. His house was destroyed. That's why he picks up nails. Cold-hearted, but still his father. Time has changed. As kids, we kept asking parents for money to buy candy and stuff. There was nothing to worry about. That's right. Remember, Kiku, your sleeves were always shiny with snot. Tane, you used to do this. Nowadays children don't do that. But they're not relaxed. Times are harder for them. They became shy and started picking up butts and nails... We shouldn't let our kids do that. It's not right for kids. That's right, kids should be more carefree... What a life. Well, I must be going. - Don't forget the hose. - I'll ask him. - Here, son. Good bye. - Good bye. What did she give you? Ten yen. You should have thanked her. Stupid! Come here, son. Come over here. Go and buy a lottery ticket with that ten yen. You'll win, I'm sure you will. You're more or less pure minded, go and buy one. - Do you know where? - Yes. Go, and win 2,000 yen. Don't fool around on the way back. - You're working hard. - This is nothing. It's easy work. I don't call it work. It's like killing time with something to do. Have you seen the portable shrine I made for the festival? My skill is wasted. - Maybe I shouldn't. - Shouldn't what? Ask you a small favour. Not at all. What is it? A rubber hose, a long one. A hose? It's hard to find. It's very expensive. Are you buying it? No, it's for... The mistress of the geisha house? She won't mind the price. I'll find it for her. I've got a bicycle tire. No punctures in it, brand new. A good one. - Hello. - Hello. Excuse me... Father, you are home today. Sure, and what is it today? The beauty parlour was so crowded... I see. Yuki, I haven't seen you for a while, and you've put on weight. - Have I? - It's a miracle. It's hard to do nowadays. Have you had lunch, Dad? No. Did you bring something good? No. I thought I'd join you. You must be kidding. You don't bring anything, and then eat my lunch? You see what a father has to go through? No wonder she put on weight. Sorry, I've got to go. How did it go, then? Did you win? Show me. I didn't. - You didn't win? Nothing? - No. - Didn't they give you cigarettes? - No. - They didn't? - No. - You lost ten yen for nothing? - Yes. You're stupid. It's your bad attitude, and you lost ten yen for it. Now then, don't cry, you're a boy... Here, I'll give it back to you. Take this. You really are silly, aren't you? You made me lose money. I lost ten yen for nothing. Kawayoshi! Oh, welcome back. The soda you wanted, I found it, but it'll be a few days. Oh, thank you very much. Sorry for the trouble. Not at all. Don't you want a jacket? With a stiff collar, a nice one. What's up? Tane is mad or something. Well, you ate them, didn't you? If you did, say you ate them. Or I'll really punish you. You're a stubborn boy. Come on tell me. Did you eat them? Now, don't lie to me. - You ate them, didn't you? - Tane! What are you mad about? This kid ate my dried persimmons. Tane you don't have to be so mad. I'm not only mad about the persimmons. I'm mad because he's so stubborn. Did you eat them? Don't shout at him like that. Why not? Leave me alone. Well, I don't know what to say... Tane, it was me who ate them. What? You ate them? Yeah, they wanted me to... - Who did? - Well... I get this craving for sweet things... And I happened to see them... You didn't have to eat the best ones. They seemed to want me to eat them... You should listen to yourself. What a man! You owe the boy an apology. I guess I was wrong, I'm sorry, son. Forgive me. You really did have a hard time. I'm sorry. Look at that! I'm sorry, son. I was wrong. It's OK now. I know you didn't eat them. Poor boy, it was my mistake. Will you forgive me? Stop crying. Here you are. You mean he did it again? What an impossible kid! Your scolding didn't sink in? Like a horse again? And he's fanning it again? No, he's missing. You must have scolded him. No way. He's been missing all morning. He was acting funny and left before breakfast... His futon was all put away, and he's not around. Where did he go? It's after 2 o'clock, isn't it? I'm afraid he won't come back at all. This is a case of piss-and-run... You think so? I wonder where he went... He has no place to go anyway. He's like an alley-cat. Silly kid, he'll get hungry. Don't worry, he'll live on garbage. It's good riddance for you. The little devil's gone. You think so? You were nagging him again. No, I wasn't. I mean, yesterday. I scolded him a little yesterday. About the persimmons, he was so stubborn. He never spoke. Just tears came out of him... What could he say? He didn't eat them. There we go. But he was tough. He kept on glaring at me like a stubborn old mule. He was so stubborn that I got really mad. So I glared back at him. Poor boy. The guy over there said he took them. I was a little too hard. You were always short-tempered. And when you're mad, your face... It's especially scary. It's too much for any child. Your glaring at him did it. That's right. I did it too much. So I apologised. I used to wet the bed at that age, too. I used to do that too. Anyway, I feel sorry for him. A boy like him might become a great man. All great men weren't all that bright. But maybe rather stupid when they were small. That's what they say. He was picking up nails for his cold-hearted father. He has a gentle heart. He really was a lovely kid. I guess you lost a treasure. He's precious to you, isn't he? You were fond of him, weren't you? Of course you were. You were getting to really like him already. Do you think so? Sure, it's so obvious. Is that right? Hmm. What's that "Hmm"? I didn't realise it. That's right, that's the way it is. You already feel affection. A dog starts to wag its tail before you know it. You just can't see the tail. But you are both wagging your tails. The boy's tail is small and slender. Your tail is fat and long, like a big fighting dog. With the blood of a bulldog. Oh, stop it, I'll hit you. I hope some kind person picks him up... - What wrong? - I think it's the boy's fleas... It's dangerous here. I'll come again. Bye. Good bye. What will you do if the boy comes back? Will you treat me? Will you look after him again, please? And don't scold him too much. He wet his bed again and he was afraid of you... Did you find him? - Yes. - Where was he? At Kudan, where I first found him. Scared of you but no place to go... I think he suddenly missed his father. I couldn't help but feel sorry for him. Will you let him stay again? All right. Don't be too hard. He's sorry, he's standing outside. I'm counting on you. Here you are. Please look after him! I'll go home, too. Come on now, you must be hungry. Come here. You are hungry, aren't you? Now, eat it. Go ahead. Thank you. Sorry there's no rice. I ate your share. And I didn't cook any tonight. - Tell me, do you like me? - Yes. You do? You can stay here with me. Would you like to be my son? What do you say? - You will? Right? - Yes. Eat this one, leave the burnt one. Eat it up, you can eat all of it. Tell me, what does it feel like? It's really great, I've never felt so good before. You call it maternal love. You look like a grandma nursing a grandchild. Stop that, I'll hit you. Look, that cap is too big. It's fallen off three times. Don't worry, his head will soon grow to fit it. By the time he goes to school, it'll fit him. Son... Shall I carry your cap? Where are the racoons? There in the cage next to the rabbits. Do they change their shape? Yes. At midnight. Can we stay here till then? No we can't, we're going to have our picture taken later. Why don't you join us? No. It's bad luck to have three in a picture. That's superstitious, isn't it? Yes, Please. - I'll be in the centre. - Please, come. No, I don't like pictures. Come on, you'll only look good next to me. - No, I won't. - Don't be modest... Do we look all right? The boy should have had his hair cut. But we didn't go because he had a runny nose. The cap's too big. Is that right? Yes, it is. Shall I hold it? All right? Yes, that's better. Is it really? Are you ready? Now, don't move and close your mouth. Is your nose clean? Now, you just look at him. Mother, quiet please. Close your mouth, please. Here we go... Now. Thank you. How did I look? Like a lady. That was my best look. Did I look funny? - You looked like it. - Like what? That thing we saw at the zoo... I really will hit you Was your nose clean? Didn't we have fun? The tempura was good, wasn't it? Do you want to take it off? Don't you think I'm a nice lady, buying you this? Take good care of it. You can wear this to school too. Aren't you tired yet? I'm exhausted. Would you massage my shoulders like a good boy? A little lower. Just there, yes. We'll get your hair cut tomorrow. You'll look great. You're a good boy if it weren't for you wetting the bed. You'll get over it soon. - Excuse me. - Who is it? Go and see. It's Dad! I'm his father. You were so kind to look after him... Thank you very much. Not at all. I came to Tokyo on the 9th with him. And I lost him at Kudan. I looked for him everywhere. I went to Chigasaki hoping he was there. And I was told you went there, too... That's nothing, but you must have been worried. Yes, you see, we only have each other... I even went to Hachioji where we lost our house. Is that so? You've had a hard time... Aren't you glad your dad found you here? Say thank you to the lady. I'm sorry he has no manners. Thank you so much for everything. That's all right. Say thank you to the lady, and then we must leave. A token of my thanks, I bought them at Chigasaki. You didn't have to do this. It's nothing, just potatoes. Thank you very much. Wait a minute. This is for the boy. Is it all right? Please. Thank you. It's very kind of you... thank you. Not at all. Take care now. Son, come to see me with your dad. Be sure to come. Thank you so much. Say goodbye to Auntie. Goodbye, Auntie. Don't lose your dad again. Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye. So, his father came, then? I'm glad he found him. You can sleep peacefully now. He wasn't abandoned, then? I see. Anyway, I'm glad it came to a happy ending. What's wrong? You don't have to cry. You didn't like the kid to begin with... But you miss him anyway? I'm not crying because I'm sad. Just think, how happy he is now... You see, he got lost like he said. I thought the father was hard-hearted. But he's a good, nice father. He was searching for him. Now, he found his son and they can live together... Think how happy they are... It just makes me cry... The father's not a bad man. He's very polite, too. He's sort of dignified, with a gentle heart. The boy must be happy. Really? I'm glad to hear that. He is just a boy and once he saw his dad's face, he totally forgot all the butts and nails here. Is that so? A father and son, it was very nice to see them. I wish I had pampered him a lot more... I regret picking on that innocent boy like I did... Come to think of it, my feelings have changed a lot. Being selfish like we are now, won't do. Like pushing people away to get on the train... Eating our fill, ignoring others who are starving... We worry too much about our own lives. What you're saying is right. I realise it now. I'm ashamed of myself. Children are wonderful. He was only with me for a week but he really made me think. I wish I could have lived with him longer. Tell me, Tashiro... Can't I have a baby any more? You? Lt'll be awkward if you have a baby... You're a widow. I mean, adopt one or pick one up... Then, it's possible. I've got this urge, I want a child. Yes, a child is a wonderful thing. Will you read my palm? To see whether or not... Is your zodiac the wild boar? Then, go in that direction. Which direction? Hongo or Shitaya area. Shitaya? Near Ueno Park? Yes. Captain Saigo's statue is in Ueno. Look around there. Captain Saigo... the statue... THE END
