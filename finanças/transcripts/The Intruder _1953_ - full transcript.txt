Oh! It's your ball, guv. Hey, thanks! Oh, what an amazing sight. Breaking 'em up for scrap. Well, how many have you got here? Oh, there must be two or 300. There's some more over in the back there soon. We turn them into tractors. They're a very good proposition. You're interested in tractors? No, thank you very much. I spent five years during the war driving around in one of these, it was quite enough. Come on, it's getting late. Go up another and play three. All right. There we are. Thank you very much, guv. Very decent of you. Good job this, third this week. Give me the spoon, will you? Here's the money I owe you. Oh, thanks. I must say, for a stock broker, you're a pretty rotten golfer. Oh, it's a habit I've cultivated. I always let my clients win. We must hurry. Are you going to Peggy and Simon's tonight? Yeah. Shall we go together? Fine. Thanks a lot, Tim. See you in half an hour. All right. Don't move. Stay where you are. Colonel merton. What the devil are you doing here? What do you think? Did you know I lived here? No, and I don't care either. Put that down. Pull yourself together, Edwards. You better have a drink. How do I know you haven't got another gun in there? You don't. Now drop that and relax. What are you after? I want the money you've taken from that desk. And I'd also like to know what's turned A good soldier into a thief. You can keep calm, I'm only gonna fetch something. You phoned the police! Now don't be a damn fool. Do you remember sidi rezegh? Yes. When I came in just now, I hardly recognised you. Why should you? It's a long time. Yeah. Sergeant cope. Pirry. John summers. That's you. And what was that man's name? He wasn't in tank crews at all. Have you kept in touch with any of them? Only one. Have you? No, I'm afraid not. I seem to have forgotten half their faces. Those were the days, eh? It was the place we all nearly copped it. Cope! Are they all in yet? All that are left, sir, I reckon. So, there goes a squadron. I wonder if just for once we could fight A tank action without being outranged. It doesn't look as though we shall Get the chance to find out. Get sergeant cope! Who are you? What are you doing here? You aren't tank crew! No, sir. Here on supply. My truck got blown up. I knew they had sent me up too far. Well, I'm afraid you'll have to stay with us now. Oh, thank you! Keep your head down! What's the full name, sir? Well, when it's nearly dark, we'll try to get back. well, it won't be much of a picnic With their infantry in front of us. What about the wounded, sir? It's drastic, it's very bad. I'm afraid any wounded will have to be left. Pirry. Pirry! If I knew anything about it, They'll come in south of the sun. if we don't get a message back to brigade pretty quick, we'll of have it. If we don't get out of here pretty soon, We'll have had it too. Pirry. That third tank there. Isn't it yours? Yes. Was your wires put out of action? My operator was killed, I think. Well, do you think there's a chance it may work? I don't know. A mechanic might get it going. Sergeant cope. Sir. I want a word with summers, and, who else? Edwards. If the Germans do come, we shan't stand an earthly. Summers, Edwards. Come on, the old man wants you. I want you two to make a run for it To Mr. pirry's tank and get the radio set working. What if the set's smashed, sir? Well, you won't know that 'til you get there, will you? No, sir. Try and get in touch with brigade and tell them what's happening. When you've made contact, signal me. Right? Right, sir. Now keep separated, and run like hell. Go on, off you go. They've spotted them. It's jammed! Get something to club it with! They've got through! You rotten! Edwards! You did phone the police! Those were the days, you said. Oh, I fell for it like a mug! Those were the days, you! Hey, aren't you ready yet? Look, Tim. Be a good chap and go on ahead and give Peggy my apologies, I'm afraid I'm gonna be a bit late. Well, what's the matter? You look as though you've seen a ghost. But I've never heard anything so ridiculous. you can't go chasing this character In the middle of the night. Anyway, what's it got to do with you? Why don't you let the police deal with it? Look, Tim, he once saved my whole squadron. I know it's a long time since the war, But I just don't believe a man can change that much. I'd of trusted him anywhere. I don't see what you can do about it Except forget it. I just feel I've got to try and find him Before he gets into really serious trouble. If you can find him. Well, he said he'd been in touch with one of the people in a photograph I showed him just now. I have a pretty sure idea who that'll be. Well, I don't suppose anything I say can make much difference, but, I think you're mad. And Peggy will be a lot madder if you don't show up, so don't be long. I won't. 8.60. That's the lot. Right. Do you know where I can find a man by the name of summers? How many 150's left, Ron? Eight. How many 176's? Seven. Summers. Hello. Oh. Well, this is a surprise. How are you, sir? Fine, thanks. Oh! What brings you to the garden? Well, I'm afraid it's something rather serious. Do you remember ginger Edwards? Ginger? Yes. Have you seen anything of him recently? Ginger? Why I'm afraid not, sir. I haven't seen ginger for, mm, Six or seven years. no, not since the end of the war, to be exact. I don't know what's happened to him. well, I know that most of us Have somehow drifted apart. Well, it was bound to happen. But I thought you two were very good friends. Oh, yes, yes we were. But that all came to an end. How do you mean, when? In Italy. When I got my commission. Yes, as a matter of fact, It was the very night I joined the mess. I don't know whether you remember, I came to see you... Hello, summers. Evening, sir. What about a drink? Thank you, sir. Whiskey? Please, sir. Whiskey. Soda? Thank you, sir. Thank you for all you've done for me, sir. Nonsense, you've earned your commission. There's no question of thanks about it. Thank you, sir. Anyway, here's to you. Congratulations and welcome to the mess. Thank you, sir. Dinner's served, sir. Oh, right. I doubt if you'll find the food As good as the sergeant's mess. if nothing comes through by Friday, we better put out a... In 1938. So there it was! Very awkward it was, too. Not to mean I say I knew the form. Bugsy of course knew the form. I'm not sure the fellows didn't know, he never mentioned him. I certainly know beale street, Not even the brigadier, apparently. Of course, anytime anybody said anything, It sounded to us just like a double entendre. Well, this went on for months. Well, weeks anyway, to be accurate. And that was all this bump Piling up, and up in the actions of it. So, McKenzie you know? McKenzie? No, no. No? Oh, first class chap. A little job on the staff now. Used to live near Dorchester. Or was it canterbury. Oh, well, it doesn't matter. how was bugsy getting hotter and hotter under the column? He couldn't see anything. Well, I couldn't see anything either. I mean, could I? Yes. No. Well, then we went off on exile. We came back, not a word. Then we went over another air sight, came back again. well then I went on leave, And I took my wife up to people's palace in Scotland. First class fishing there. Yes. Not on the d, on the... Oh, what is it? The... You know! Well, the... Famous. Oh nevermind, I'll think about it later. She tells me they've taken the place over now. Home for children, or something. I think they're kicking it to pieces. Anyway, then I came back. when I got back, now this is the amusing part, you reckon it would be in there. I didn't believe it at the time, but it was perfectly too. I told Jackie rowe to explain it all to me later. anyway, I got back, I went into the mess, And those old boys were looking white as a sheet. He always looked pretty grey anyway. And he took me over into a corner and he told me. Now, you think I'm making this up, don't you? Now I'm not, I swear to you, it's true. He told me that the brigadier... the brigadier, mind you, had told him that he'd known all about The whole sure muzzle the whole time. Ha! Oh, I say, jolly good health. Well, I'd leave that if I were you. Oh, by the way. You remember that trooper I was telling you about this morning? What trooper? Williams in a squadron. The one who went down and had himself a party In the village all by himself. Well, if it is something to think of that, it happened a couple of years ago. I think I told you about it. I knew it was very wrong. I wasn't there myself, but Willie Stokes told me about it. No, it wasn't Willie, it was brother, Billy. well, fair play, he had a trooper who was a welshman. Now, wait a minute. Let me get this straight. Was he a welshman? Yes, that's right, he was a welshman. well, this lad got himself a pass one Saturday night and went down to the village. Oh. I should've told you that this was all in Yorkshire. Near catterick. Not in catterick, near catterick. Well, this lad went down to the village, hot chap... I say, chap, are you on fire? No, I don't think so. Well, somebody is. Great Scott, it's me! What on earth! Evening, sir. Hello, Parker. Seem to be having a bit of a party out there, sir. Yes. It's a monastery, isn't it, sir? Yes. Seems a pity, don't it? Good night, sir. Good night. I love you. I got it. All right, I'll have vino then. Good night, Luigi. What's the matter with you? Nothing, sir. But I'd better be going. Have one for the road? No thank you, sir. He's a good man. He no drink plenty. He'll be just friend, this a good man. I know he's a good man. No send him away. I'm not sending him away! I'm due back in billet, sir. I'm off. You're not off! You're gonna stay and drink a glass of wine with me if it chokes you! That's an order. Luigi, fill up his glass. Si. Right up. Oh, I shouldn't really be here, sir. Nor should I. Oh, come on, ginger. Just a quick one to celebrate it. What's it like being an officer? Bloody awful. Luigi, get out the cognac. J the maiden come to you j j I heard a knocking at the door j j there she was, all ready for j j I grabbed her by the arms and held her tight j J and that ain't all j rub-a-dub-a-dub, tres bon j j chapter three, chapter three j j did she sit up on your knee j j she gave a yell and shouted out j j louder than a railway port j j I never seen the like since I was born j j shining for power, her eyes j j yippee-ai-yay, yippee-ai-yay j j yippee-ai-yay for the one eyed rider j j rub-a-dub-a-dub, and that ain't all & j rub-a-dub-a-dub, tres bon j j rum pum pum j j chapter four, did you go and lock the door j j I heard a footstep on the stair j j oh, my rider, not much longer j j when it breaks, a pistol's in his hand j j looking for the man who kissed his daughter j j yippee-ai-yay, yippee-ai-yay j j yippee-ai-yay, for the one eyed rider j j rub-a-dub-a-dub, and that ain't all & j rub-a-dub-a-dub, tres bon j j bon j Get back to your billet, and put your cap on. Well, be quick about it. and now that they've made you an officer, You might at least try and behave like one. And I must say, I thought it a bit much. As they're both in my troop, It puts me in a rather embarrassing situation. I thought I better report it. I see. Then, will you speak to summers or would you like me to? I don't think either of us will. Well, surely someone must. when I want your advice in running the regiment, I'll ask for it. I'm sorry, sir. I suggest you try and help summers to settle down instead of coming in here Deliberately stirring up trouble for him. Do you think he'll ever settle down? I commissioned summers because I think He's got the makings of a damn good officer. I'm short of them. Anything else? Right. Well, Evans, what is it? We gave one to send out at the trail zone. When? Noon. Oh. Is that the lot? No. Summers wants to see you. He says it's personal. He's waiting outside. Oh, all right. Send him in. Well, what is it? I want to resign my commission, sir. Why? I'm not cut out for it, sir. Isn't that for me to decide? You made a mistake, sir. I'm not the sort that makes an officer, And I never will be, sir. Well, I'm afraid I haven't the time To deal with your personal problems at the moment. Did you set your troop this morning? Yes, sir. And report to the adjutant. We've got to send a patrol at noon, Yours is the only troop I can spare. Oh, haven't you better get going? Yes, sir. Oh, and summers, one other thing. Yes, sir? I'm not allowed to make mistakes. That's about all there was to it. a bit later on after I'd settled down, I was glad you didn't take me At my word that morning. but I knew I got to steer clear of ginger for both our sakes. Someone been hurt? Yes, one of the chaps cut himself this morning. Where's Edwards? Where is he? I've told you, I don't know. Now, what are you two up to? I'll find him if I have to move every crate in this place. Want something, guv? Can't you see I'm trying to help him too? Is that why you phoned the police last ni... So you have seen him. Does ginger really believe that? Come on, now. Down here. Ginger? It's all right! Ginger? It's okay. Ginger! Where are you? He's gone. Well, do you know where he'd be making for? No, he said he'd kept in touch with one of the lads in the regiment. He thought he might help him. Yes, I know, but who? Well, I asked him, but he wouldn't tell me. He said it was better that way. You thought it was me, sir. Well, it was only natural I suppose. Oh, colonel merton? Ah. I've checked on them all now, sir. 14 of them, and it's like this. One died in Germany, one was killed in a car crash in 1947, One's in Australia, two are in Canada. Edwards and one other we have no trace of. And that leaves a further seven in this country, sir. Lieutenant summers, whom you've seen, sir. Then there's captain pirry, corporal slake. I've given you their addresses, and there's four more. Do you want the names, sir? Please. In alphabetical order, sir. sergeant major cope, captain dencham, Trooper Martin, and corporal young. Those were not the ranks of all of them at the time of the photo, sir. That was their ranks at the time Of leaving the fort after Germany. Thank you. Well, I've have the other addresses this evening, sir. I'll send them on with this photo. Thank you very much, sergeant. Goodbye, sir. Goodbye. Hello? Avendale electric. Hold the line, I'll put you through. You're through. Hello? Avendale electric. I'm sorry, he's not in at the moment. Can I take a message? Right, I'll tell him. Goodbye. Avendale electric. Mr. merton. Captain pirry won't keep you waiting a moment. Hello, fox three. pull up to the edge of the wood on my left and prepare to support. There's something going on in the wood in front of me. Up that road there. I don't know what yet. It doesn't look too healthy. I don't care for their bit of open ground, either. I think we better hut up the edge of the wood first. Fire! Hello, fox two. They've got our range. It's getting pretty hot. Fox two, over. Hello, fox one. It'll get hotter still if you stay there. Go on! Out. Driver, advance. Drive a hard right. Hard right. Speed up. Speed up! Come on! Wait for that gap. Get your foot. Fire! Driver! Driver! The ic's gone dead! The set's dead, sir! Littany's poor, sir. Bail out! We're on fire! Bail out! Bail out! I've been hit! You all right, sir? Yeah. Captain pirry will see you now, sir. Captain pirry will see you now. Would you go in, please? Avendale electric. Putting you through. I'll get that done at once, Ms. bowe. Bring me the hedges and Wilson file. My dear wolf, what a pleasure. And what a surprise, after all these years. Will you sit down? Thanks. Drink? No, thanks. Oh. Now... What can I do for you? Pirry, do you remember a man called Edwards? He was in your troop. Well, certainly. Have you seen anything of him Since the war, by any chance? Have I? What an extraordinary question. Only I caught him burglaring my house the other night. Edwards, really? Why'd you come to me for? I'm trying to trace him. I know that he's been in touch With one the men in a photograph I showed him. You were one of them. I'm not in the habit of associating with housebreakers. No, of course not. Then I don't believe that Edwards really is a burglar. Why not? because of his war record, And because I had a few words with him. even if you haven't seen or heard of him, I thought perhaps you might be a bit concerned. naturally I'm sorry, But I can't say I care very much. Are you going to go looking for him? I had thought of it, why? You've been to the police, I presume? No. Why not? I should thought it was the obvious thing to do, Quite apart from the fact that it's your duty. Duty? Well, a man breaks into your house, you do nothing about it. You're aiding and abetting a criminal. That's a very serious offence. I don't agree. it's not even a burglary if I don't charge him with having stolen something. You must charge him, you're bound to. Pirry! He was one of your own men. Well, I can't help that. He's obviously turned into a suddenly bad lot. A spin in prison might do him good. Don't be so smug! and just because a man has a sense of duty, You mustn't call him smug. It's your duty to go to the police. You can't take the law into your own hands. Just remember, you're no longer the colonel now. nobody cares a row of beans What you say or what you think. You thought you were so wonderful, You thought the regiment was so loyal and fine. Well, let me tell you this. that that day, when I was hit in my tank, I could've cried with joy because I knew that I was rid Of the whole stupid lot of you! The day when you were hit in your tank? What are you implying? if your crew hadn't got to safety after you deserted them, I'd of had you court marshalled for cowardice! Miss rider. Yes, sir? Get me the cid inspector, central police station. Very good, sir. Six z. Now then. this dear little digit hops across to the other side, And what do you think happens then? No calling out. Hands up. Come, come, boys. What happens then? You tell them, Marshall. Um... Speak up, boy. I don't know, sir. Of course you know, we went through all this yesterday. Well, what is it? Mr. merton to see you. Mr. merton? You can't mean colonel merton. I haven't any idea. Boys. colonel merton commanded the regiment In which I had the honour to serve during the war. this is indeed a great surprise, And, I might add, a very pleasant one. Excuse me. Take over, Mr. drinkwater, please. You might try and explain that equation to them. The y's are oranges, the z's are lemons. Colonel merton. This is an honour, sir. A very great honour. How are you, slake? Splendid, splendid. I'm afraid I've come at a bad time, at school hours. Oh, no, no, no, no, not at all. I'm sure the boys can do without me for a few minutes. In fact, they always seem to relish an interruption. How long have you been a headmaster, slake? The promotion was quite recent, sir. A hard journey, you know. Oh, congratulations. I was at winfield before the war, of course. I'm sorry, I'm sure this is most inconvenient, but I wondered if you remembered A chap in a squadron called ginger Edwards. Edwards? If not for him, I should've been spared The most acute embarrassment in recent weeks. Oh? I had little thought after all these years that such a trifling indiscretion in Brussels would've caught up with me. Brussels? Yes. Ironically enough, it followed on my applying... Come on, now. Keep in line. left right, left right, left right, left right, left right, left right, left right, left right. Marching! Halt! Suit! All right, at ease. What is it, slake? I want to transfer to tank crew, sir. In what capacity? Gunner, sir. Is he trained, Mr. Evans? the 05205 corporal slake, b, joined a gunnery course at lunmouth in August, 1940. He was very below average, sir. That was because of a little accident, sir. What little accident? My buzzer went off inadvertently. The instructor... Sergeant. It was only a minor injury, sir. and since then, you've been in The quartermaster's store, haven't you? Yes, sir. Well, I doubt very much they can spare you. I mean, you're doing a very important job. Refitting us for the rhine crossing. What would sergeant greaves do without you? Oh, I don't think he'd mind at all, sir. Could sergeant greaves spare him? No, sir! Sergeant greaves could not spare him, sir. Not with any possibility of doubt, sir. You see, slake? I'm afraid you've made yourself indispensable. Sir, about turn! Quick march! Left right, left right, left right, left right, Left right, left right, left! Well, where was she then? Gotta hand it to them, Fred. Them poster artists are blooming magicians. Hello, Bert. Hello, ginger. Get on! Place! Up, two, three, left, right. You see the show last night? No. You're lucky, mate. Murder it was! I thought all you tank crews were in the parade. M.o. Let me off. Got a bad foot. Oh, so you have. Bert, look. Follow me. Oh, June, it's ever so light. You can see right down to the bottom. Good morning, all! Oh! We were just talking, we... You're miss bee, aren't you? Yes, that's right. Oh, how did you guess? Well, your picture's on all the posters. Oh, of course it is, isn't it? Well, this is... Oh... This is June maple, she's in the show as well. Hi, June. I'm ginger, and this is Bert. Oh, pleased to meet you. How do you do? Hello. How do you do? Well, and what can we do you for this morning? well, we're just having a bit of a look round really, you know. We're having a look at your tanks, actually. You must be ever so brave To ride around in things like this. I suppose we couldn't go inside one, could we? Just to have a look round? Do you want to? I'd love to. Come on, I'll show you around. Oh, can't I come too? Oh, I'm afraid not. Only one at a time. Bert, why don't you take miss bee And show her round one of the others? Oh, would you really? Oh, come on, it'd be lovely. Come on, now. Well, nothing. Only, it's not really allowed, you know. Oh, well of course. I don't want to get you into any trouble. Oh no, it's not that. Only, well, it's awfully dirty inside. Oh, you don't want to worry about the dirt! I was a land girl before I was discovered. Here we go. Oh, dear. Gonna be a bit awkward, isn't it? I have to get my skirt up, that's right. There. I don't mind you pushing me. Thank you very much, thank you. Now your turn. There we go, upsy Daisy. That's right. There we are. Well, here we are. Yes. Now we're going inside, aren't we? Is this the lid here? Oh! Oh. Oh, well you'd better go first Because you know the way, don't you? That's right. Now me now. Oh! Oh, I say. Isn't it dark in here? Just like the tunnel of love, isn't it? Don't you think you ought to put the light on. The light? Yes. Oh, yes. The light. Oh, that's it there, isn't it? Oh. Oh, here I come. You'll have to catch me. Here we come. Careful. I'm coming. Ooh! Oh, blimey. Oh. Oh, I say. Isn't this exciting? Oh, I've got butterflies in my tummy. I haven't felt like this Since I was in a submarine. With the Navy boys, you know. Here we have the rangefinder, self centering apparatus, automatic file control. Sliding breach with automatic ejection. The for... Do you want me to go on? Yes, I'm interested. My husband's in tanks. Oh, is he? Out east. Are you married? No. I'm gonna be when this lot's over, though. What's that? Oh, that's the parade, I expect. Good morning, merton. Good morning, sir. Nice to see you again. Thank you. Barracks comfortable? Yes, sir. Thank you. You've been here now... 10 days, sir. Oh, 10 days. Owens still there to see you? No, sir. Harris, actually. Good, Harris. Oh, and who sits there? Where? There! Oh, yeah. The driver. Does he? Yes. I suppose he has a little hole So he can see where he's going. Yeah. Well, you must have muttony. Oh, and who sits on that dear little seat there? Oh, the gunner. Oh! Bang bang! Now what have you done, you silly boy? Confide it, merton. Why is it that as soon as the division gets billeted in foreign barracks, the turn out goes to pot. Yes, sir. Would you care to go to the mess now? No, later. Oh, look! There's the periscope. Oh, I must have a peek at this. Oh! Zoom, zoom! Oh! Oh. Oh, look. Oh, there's the general. The general? Yes, he's coming this way. Good heavens! We shall be court mashaled. We must get out of here. Oh my cap. I'm not properly dressed. Oh, look! What are they doing now? They stopped. Oh, they're taking a snap. Oh, isn't that nice? Oh, no. Here they come again. Don't lose sight of them. I don't know why you're so worried, I'm sure. In anniston we need lots of generals. And they're quite nice, really, When you get to know them. Where have they got to now? Oh, it's all right, they've gone. Heaven be praised. You mustn't fuss so. Yes, well, we must get out of here now. Oh, no. Just one more twiddle, please. Just one more, here we go! Ooh, ooh. What's the matter? I think I'm gonna be sick. Oh no! I am. Oh, please get me out of here. well, these 500 miles couldn't been saved by the use of transported. Yes, sir. I shall take it up with... Oh, please. Be quick! Who is that man? What on earth? Most unfortunate, most unfortunate. Very unhappy situation, as you can see. That is the embarrassment. The board of governors won't let me take it down. they don't know the facts, And I fear I haven't dared to tell them. Bertram, you really must speak to those boys, you know. The things they write in their handbooks, I... Gracious! Ah! Excuse me. Allow me to present my wife. Colonel merton. How are you? How... How do you do? Do you excuse my wife not coming out. She has to see the catering arrangements, you know. Goodbye, sir. And do come and see us again! Go and ask him, it's your idea! What's the matter, you afraid? Go on, you've thought of it, you ask him. Go on, he'll be gon in a minute. Go on! Excuse me, sir, colonel merton. Can I have your autograph, sir? Yes, if wanted. Please sir, use mine. Will that do? Yes, sir, thank you, sir. Excuse me, sir. Is it true about Mr. slake? I mean, was he really brave like on the poster? Oh, precisely. I was there when it was taken. I say! I say! I say! Goodbye, sir. Goodbye. All right, sergeant, keep after it. Very good, sir. You stay here. I'm going down to the local station To see what they know about this place. All right. Hello there! Well, I'm blessed. It's the colonel. Well, this is a surprise. It's been a long time, sir. Too much too long. How are you, cope? Well, I mustn't grumble, you know. Is all this land yours? Oh, yes. I've got about 150 acres. You have? Well done. Have you seen anything of any of the lads? Oh, not really, do I? I mean, I'm a bit off the beaten track here. What brings you around these parts? I'm looking for an old friend of ours. Ginger Edwards. Ginger? Yes. Have you seen anything of him since the war? Oh, yes. When? Well, it's some while ago since I saw him. You don't know where he is now? No, I'm afraid I have no idea where he is now, sir. Well, sorry sir. Can't help you. I caught him burglaring my house the other night. Look, cope. You knew him better than I did. What on earth turns a chap like that into a thief? Well, sir, he really never had a chance. Ginger's been in trouble a long time. It started on the very day he was demobbed. Let him have it, alf! Dickie, you old son of a gun! Oh, I see I still have to teach you a thing or two. Fancy letting little Jerry sneak up on you like that, en? Come on, Dickie. Home. Oh, come on then. What's the matter? Promise you won't tell uncle Walter where you found me? He don't like me playing tanks. All right, I won't tell him. Rooster! How is the old boy anyway? He hates me. Oh, nonsense! He's been very good to us. He does, I know he does. Well, you don't have to worry now, Dickie. I'm back for good. I'll look after ya! Here, give me that. No, it's all right, ginger. I can manage. Here, wait a minute! You can't go in there like that. Uncle Walter will tear the hide off you. Tell you what, I've got a better idea. You know where Tina lives? Well, you run along there and tell her I'll be around in 10 minutes. I'll go in and square you with uncle. Tell her to put her best dress on. Welcome home, Arthur. Hello, uncle Walter. Well, come in my boy, come in. Oh, Dickie will be sorry to have missed you. Here, let me take that. You did wipe your boots, didn't you? You know, we expected you back rather earlier than this, But I suppose the train was late, eh? Yes, it was a bit. Uh huh. Well, it's good to see you back, my boy. We're proud of you. And you've been constantly In our prayers, you know, Arthur. Oh. Thank you, uncle. What do you want, Dickie? I've got a message for you. Well, what is it, Dickie? Who's it from? Ginger's home. He says to tell you to be round in 10 minutes. Well, Dickie. Tell ginger, will you... Oh, stop bouncing that blasted ball when I'm talking to youl! Tell him that... Excuse me. Dickie. Now Dickie, run along, there's a good boy. And tell ginger... Tell ginger to stay away from here altogether. Got that, son? Okay, mister. I'll tell him. Bill, what will I do? Tell him to buzz off! But he wants to marry me. But baby, I'm gonna marry you. Didn't I tell you? Oh, yes, I've no doubt you did go through some hard times. But so did you father and me in the great war. I notice you've taken up smoking, Arthur. Now as you know, that's not a habit that I approve of. and now that you're back home again, I hope you'll be able to cure yourself. Richard! Come here at once! You've been playing around With those young hooligans, haven't you? Look at you! Do you remember what I said was gonna happen if I caught you at it again? Hm? I'm afraid it was my fault. I must ask you to keep out of this if you don't mind, please, Arthur. Well, what did I say was gonna happen? Oh, very well then. Go upstairs. Go on! I won't have him associating with those young ruffians, turning himself into a cosh boy or whatever it is they call themselves. They were just having a bit of fun. Fun, do you call it? When a child comes home in that state? Well, they get a bit excited, that's all. Oh, master Richard will have to learn to curb his excitement. You heard what I said! Go up to your room at once! Don't take it out on Dickie. I encouraged him. I intend to see that Richard is brought up as a decent, god-fearing child, And a credit to your poor parents. And it's up to you to help me! Go upstairs, Richard! Don't worry, Dickie. It'll be all right. Don't worry about it. You're not to beat him. Look. Uncle, it's my first day home. We don't want a row, do we? I told you, it's my fault. I sent the kid on an errand, He didn't have time to get cleaned up. Don't beat him. All right, Arthur. I won't punish the boy this time. But don't you think you can come back here And lay down the law to me! If you want to make it in this house, you gotta understand once and for all that I'm still that child's legal guardian, And I will not tolerate any interference. Do you understand that? It so happens, uncle, I don't intend to stay. I'm getting married, and I shall apply to the authorities For Dickie to come and live with me. But Arthur... He's not gonna go through what I did. I'm his brother, and there's nothing you can do about it. Ginger, ginger! Go up to your room and stay there! Or I'll give you a beating you deserve. Ginger says you're not to beat me. Oh, so you've been eavesdropping, have you? I don't want to stay, I want to go with ginger. Oh, no you don't! Lazy children! Hello, ginger! Tina. Tina! Oh, this is a friend of mine. Bill. Hello. I see. Bill works down at sheckley's. Night shift. Want a cigarette? No, thanks. Look, ginger. I was gonna write and tell you and then I thought, Well, no, it was better that I tell you myself. Nothing to tell, is there? Ginger, I'm sorry. Really, I am. That's all right. People change, I suppose. Oh, you're right there, soldier. Take me and Tina. Couldn't stand the sight of me to start with, she couldn't. Then, you know how it is. No, I don't. What, a bright boy like you? In the army? What army were you in, mate? I have bad luck. Flat feet. Who thinks I'd ever be a soldier? Good bye, Tina. Good bye, ginger. I'm sorry. Suits you, that uniform. Smashing. You won't have any trouble finding a girl. No! Go away, go away! Go away. You can keep her. What happened, driver? well, I was driving down the road, constable, And suddenly this child ran behind this vehicle. They never gave me a chance. Go back. You're not wanted here. Haven't you done enough harm already? If you hadn't come home, that boy would be safe and sound today. if you hadn't tried to dispute my authority, this wouldn't have happened! He was running to you! Running to me? Yes. You went for him the moment my back was turned. You're too late, you fool! The boy's dead! Yes. And it's your fault. You killed him! Manslaughter it was, sir. You were at the trial? They called me and the adjutant. and colonel Grayson, who took over the regiment when you went to Germany. we all gave ginger the best possible character, sir, But the sentence was 10 years. 10 years? Oh, it wasn't an accident, sir. The judge pointed out it was a deliberate blow. They only needed the intent to kill to make it a murder. Ah, thank you. So, it's in prison that you've been seeing him. Yes, sir. I went several times. I'm afraid I didn't do much good, though. I used to try and make him think about the future. and I offered him a job here on the farm when he came out. But he was dead set about getting away from this company altogether. He had all sorts of wild schemes, like stowing away. Well, last time I went He didn't seem to listen to a word I said. I thought it was a waste of time going anymore. That's why I stopped, sir. He lost all his remission too. Well, I don't think I was surprised when I heard about his break. He was out in a working party, made a run for it. Got away. Well, when was this? Some time last week. Oh, I'm afraid ginger's in too deep for any of us to be much help. I wish there was something I could do. Where's ginger? I'm sorry I lied to you, sir. But we gave him our word we'd not tell anyone. Come on, dear. Run along upstairs. Find your mummy. Where is he now? Up in the loft, over the granary. He's in a bad way. I'll go first, sir. He's got a gun. No, cope. I think I'd better go alone. Is that you, Don? Who is that? Oh. So it's you. Brought the police, have you? No. Any more than I called them the other night. If you don't believe me, you can go and look. Then what do you want? I want to talk to you. if you give yourself up now and finish your sentence, I'll look after you when you come out of prison. I'll find you a decent job. Somewhere where people don't know your record. If you want to go overseas, I'll pay your fare. I'll give you enough money to live on Until you can get started. I'll do anything I can to help you. Only, you've got to go straight. Now, before it's too late, and go back. What? Not on your life! you know that cope can be sent to prison for sheltering you? Yes, I know the risk he took. He didn't have to. and I daresay you've been through a lot of trouble too To try and find me, but I've made up my mind. There's your money, bar four pounds I've spent. And now clear out of here. And the gun. I need that. So that when you break into other houses It'll give you a little courage? Yes! And after that, there are ways of getting out of the country Without your kind of help! There's only one rule in this world, and I've learned it at last. It's each man out for himself! That's not true, and you know it. I wanted to find out what turned you into a thief. Now I know. You've committed a crime and you can't take the punishment. you were a man I was once proud of, now you're just a cheap little thug, you're not worth helping. And you're a fine gentleman, aren't you? Stick me back in prison and your conscience is clear. Why do you want to come here preaching at me for? What's it to you what I done? So, I did kill him. I've served seven years for it. And now I'm out, oh, I'm staying out. Why don't you give me the help I need? Give me a car to get away in? But don't come here telling me to go back to prison. That's a great help. It's the police! Go out the line, I'm gonna make a run for it! You haven't the chance! They have patrols all around the place, They'll pick you up in no time! All right! I'll help you to get away, if that's what you want. Come here. That's my car there. When you see your chance, Get into the backseat and get under the cover. And be quick about it. Give me that. As soon as we're clear, I'll drop you. You can get away, go wherever you like, anywhere. But don't come near me. What happens to you when they find out? Come on. Good evening, sir. I'm inspector Williams. I wonder if I can have a few words with you and your family. Well, yes. But this as much as I know. We're making a few inquiries. A convict has escaped from prison. We have proof he may be in this area. Well, when did this happen? A few days ago. I don't think he will be unless he's desperate. Who is he? Name is Edwards, Mr. cope. He was in the army with you, I believe. You remember him? Well, yes. But it's a long time ago. I don't think he'd make his way to these parts. Well, he'll obviously try to find some friends of his To help him, isn't he? So, you haven't seen anything of this man, Edwards? No, I haven't seen him. How long is it now, Phyllis? About six months. Seven months. If you mean when you last went to see him in prison. is there anyone else besides your family living here, Mr. cope? No, just us three. My help lives down in the village. I see. Is that your car, Mr. cope? No. Belongs to a friend of mine. Colonel merton. Is he staying here? No, just visiting us. Uh huh. I hope you don't mind my asking, But where is colonel merton at the moment? You did say he was here, didn't you? It's all right, cope. The water in this can will do. Good evening. These gentlemen are from the police. Oh. Well, what have you been up to, cope? Killing pigs without a licence? Oh, no, no, sir. Colonel merton, inspector Williams. Good evening. This is sergeant Fletcher. Good evening, sergeant. Good evening, sir. Colonel merton. Weren't you and Mr. cope in the same regiment? Yes, we were. Quite a coincidence. We're looking for a man named Edwards. He was in the same regiment as Mr. cope. You must've known him too, sir. Edwards? Yeah, they call him ginger. Oh, ginger Edwards. Yes, yes, I remember him. you haven't seen or heard anything of him by any chance, have you? No. Why? He escaped from prison last week. Prison? What on earth was he doing in prison? Didn't Mr. Cope tell you about it? No, I'm afraid not. Oh, I didn't think colonel merton would be interested. Why not? well, we hadn't seen each other for a long time. we had quite a few things to talk about Besides ginger Edwards. Well, I really don't see, inspector, why my personal conversations with cope Should be any concern of the police. In fact, I think it's none of your business. I'm sorry, Mr. merton. But you do appreciate we're carrying out an investigation. And in order to do that, I have to ask questions. some of it may seem a little unnecessary Or uncalled for, you must forgive me. I'm only doing my duty. I'm sorry, inspector. I shouldn't have spoken like that. you have a job to do finding Edwards, I quite see that. Should you run into him, You do realise it's your duty to report him. Oh, yes. I appreciate that. But I hardly think it's likely. And the same applies to you, cope. It's a very serious offence sheltering an escaped convict. If he was found on these premises, You'd be in trouble. You'd have some explaining to do. Well, what makes you think Edwards might be heading in this direction? We have our reasons. I know that Edwards was a friend of yours, but please don't be tempted To do anything unwise. I'm only saying this because I'd hate to see You or your family getting into any trouble, Mr. cope. Well, cope, I think it's time I was getting on my way. Unless these gentlemen need me. Oh, that's quite all right, sir. Well, I'll turn the car around. I think I've made myself clear. Oh, yes. We won't keep you any longer, Mr. cope. Right, thank you. Mr. merton, just a moment please. Be careful at the bottom of the hill, sir. I've got some of my men down there. I expect they want to check your past. Good night. Good bye. I'm sorry to trouble you, sir. It's orders. Oh, that's quite all right. May I see your driving licence, please? Oh, certainly. Here we are. Thank you. You mind if we look in the car, sir? But your inspector's already looked at it up at the farm. Has he, sir? Yes, I've been talking to him Over the last half an hour. The inspector, sir? Yes, inspector Williams. There's only one inspector up there, isn't there? Yes, that's quite right. All right, well, do you mind if I drive on? No, that's all right, sir. All right, good night. Good night, sir. I was on my way to call on Don cope. Well, I see you've beat me to it. So I decided to give myself up. You saved yourself a lot of trouble, Edwards. I thought I'd save everyone a lot of trouble. We'll keep in touch, ginger. Thank you, sir. you know where to get hold of me, You know where I live. I'll use the front door next time, sir.
