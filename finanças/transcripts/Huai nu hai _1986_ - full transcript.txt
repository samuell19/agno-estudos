I've got it, it's east Oh no! I really didn't play No, you haven't you really haven't I'm just piling them for someone You prefer mah-jong than I mah-jong is more important than I? You don't mah-jong, nor I That means mah-jong is more important Right, I don't like you to play Why do you have to play? It's a nice game If you lose, will you stop playing? I'm a 3-time champion, I won't lose What if I beat you and win? You win? OK, whatever you say Stop playing mah-jong Let's agree on it There're rules to play mah-jong - What are the don't? - Don't play when you're sick You've no cash. You've bad opponents What's the precautions? You'll lose if you've shaved, bathed or a cold or if you've argued, fought or hurt mixed with women Teacher, if you don't teach him he'll lose Anita You know my rules It's vital to have good reflex and memory Now to test your sight and memory If you pass, I'll be your teacher No problem Bobo, show him 6 bamboos, 8 characters, green dragon, 7 circles It's a trick! Your turn now - 9 and 5 characters, white dragon... - It's enough! Bobo, Bobo, stand behind me If you fail, you can't be my student 7 circles, 4 bamboos, 9 characters 9 and 5 characters, white dragon, 2 bamboos... 7 bamboos, I character... 6, 4 circles, w, right? Not bad, you've. Potentials, right? - Right! - Thanks! Teacher! You've to stay here for 6 months You can't leave What, here for 6 months? This period is only for basic theory Another 3, 5, 7 years practice before you reach the highest point Any crash course, say a week? It's a different art to learn except cheating Cheating? The theory is to communicate between 2 men there're many alternatives One man to attack, the other defend first learn to shuffle and pile This is called weaving Place well the cards you want throw the dice in multiples of 5 & you'll get your cards What if your cards are with your opponent? Then reshuffle them watch carefully If they ruin your cards, isn't it a waste? Then you've to see what you've got HOW? Do a mirror technique while piling Like at the lower ones, the next upper ones that's why, good eyesight and memory There's one more technique If you see others cards thrown out And you want them, do this This is a funny one -It's only a part of the defense -This is easy Let's see how you do it Me? Not with the upper ones, try the other No need Mah-jong needs, a lot of practise if you want to reach my standard I've to find a new teaching method -So slow, it's pointless -What is it? -Red dragon -Who threw red dragon, Poong! -3 characters -wait... - Who threw out 7 circles? - The same suit -7 characters -7 characters, it's all characters -4 bamboos, -1, 4 bamboos with all dragons -I've won -Hold on, me first! You can't, it's an unique suit -can't go against as you've promised -Don't lose I'll do as I've said, so will you Of course You've been to the toilet, changed your seat And you're still losing? We haven't finished, right? It's useless, You've cheated - Me? - Count Count the cards... Count them Cheating? What? Peeping at the cards? No, only going round the toilet for luck Here's my luck! This is a good set Let me count my winnings 4 characters Let me go against you 8 circles, still being proud? -Good card every time -Just a coincidence It's 8 circles again It's a tight game What is it? Stop cheating! Couldn't be! It's on your side How careless, I'll get a cloth How come you've so few cards? - Card! - A few less you've a card less I've got it here! - Stand up... - Don't fool around, stand up! Come on... Said I was fooling Stop it, it's my turn Luck is with me, I win again. Pay up! It's my turn to win again this hand No, I've got all the circles suit Let's see which one you throw 9 bamboos Hey, your turn 7 characters, Another circle, what a pity Luck's on my side Who threw at me? No, it isn't! What are you doing? Something was thrown at me -9 bamboos -North - I character -Circles again, I'll throw north What is it? -Just stretching -What a nuisance I've done it again I just don't the score of this hand -Change -Help yourself! Let's take a photo Why so proud when you've won a few hands You might lose more than you win Luck is still on my side Why so happy, you lost too! How can we shuffle them like this?
