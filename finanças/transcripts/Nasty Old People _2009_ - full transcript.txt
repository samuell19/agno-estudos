I am Mette I'm nineteen At the age of thirteen I became a Nazi Everybody loves me They'll probably attack from both sides, so let's place our guards here - and here Well, then they'll just attack from here The ones I care for... Here! Highest risk! We're vulnerable, they're getting the attention The ones I'm fighting Maby Mette should hold the speech? Of course I should The ones I impress But most of all... ... my colleagues in the home help service Since I gladly take the oldies that no one else can handle - Look, see what they've done to me? - Wake up and smell the coffee Coming to the meeting? When we first met, Märta was afraid of almost everything Of the paper-boy ... ... of the birds Of slipping on the rug ... ... and of men But most of all ... ... of being poisoned by the home help service Now open your mouth Open it up! What's in the food? Behind the door across the hall, ... lives Elsie Elsie is nearly a hundred years old Elsie is mean to almost everyone To the paper-boy ... ... the children in the backyard To the home help service You know what I think? The little one is dead! Miscarriage! But most of all she's mean to Mr W, who lives behind the window across the yard He wrote for years and years a story But when he had only one page left, ... he got cancer That made him kind of bitter At those who can fly ... ... those who can walk At those who can live But most of all ... ... because he needs home help service even though he's only fortynine Are you done...? Should we wipe? Get lost! Let's make this short! Mette, welcome back from vacation. Hope you had a good time I can see we have some trouble with your cares Who are "we"?
