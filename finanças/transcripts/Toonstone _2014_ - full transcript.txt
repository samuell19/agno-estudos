I got to jump on McConaughorse, we need to get to Toonstone. - You ready McConaughorse? - Let's do this, Dalton. Let's do it. ♪ Hello, Jack. Hello there, Slim. It's been a long, long time. So what the hell do you want? Oh, I just wanted to come into town, and show you my new badge. You're a son of a bitch, Jack. Dalton was a good man. He was weak, just like all the other lawmen in this valley. You were weak when I found you, Jack. You gave me this badge out of trust. Told me I was the best gunslinger you'd ever seen. When you become a lawman, people are supposed to respect you, Jack, not fear you. The fear kept the outlaws away. So what if the people were scared of me? Do those badges make you feel like a better man? I am a better man. Well, how are you gonna prove that, son? I want you to draw. I ain't gonna pull my iron on you, boy. 'Cause I think that deep down that young man I once knew still wants to do what's right. [gunshot] [groans] [thud] I think your aim's a little off, Jack. No, Slim, my aim's as good as it ever was. Get up and face me. I'm not gonna do it, Jack. Draw your guns, old man. Hold it right there, Jack. [gunshot] I told you to stay the hell out of this. I didn't-- [stuttering] You hold it right there! Either you get up and face me like a man, or not only will I kill you, but I'm gonna kill your friend here. And every last person in this shithole of a town. - [gunshot] - [groans] - Shit! - Dalton? Hey, Jack. I think you dropped something. [Bill] Dalton! You're alive? - Yeah, Bill. - What's going on out there? Oh, I just shot one of Two Eyed Jack's guns out of his hands and then I said, "I think you dropped something." [Bill laughs] I'm gonna write that down. Dalton, get the hell out of here, boy. Oh, no, no, no, Slim. The resilient little Sheriff wants to climb out of his rat-hole and join the party? He can join the party. Well, I think this party is pretty much over. And I do believe that's my badge you're wearing. Oh, this badge? How do you think you're gonna take it from me? [munching] Oh, I see what you're doing. Learned all your tricks from Slim here. [munching] That's not gonna get to me, Mr. Dalton. [munching] What if I was eating an apple, Mr. Dalton? Would you get irritated? Don't think you would because you know the trick. [continues munching] It's not bothering me. Go ahead and say something, why don't you? [munching] All right, fine, eat your apple. I'll sit here and wait. [continues munching] [continues munching] [swallows] There. Now draw your-- Oh, for the love-- I understand what you're doing and it ain't gonna work! "Oh! Look at me, I'm Dalton!" [mimics munching] I understand the trick. [continues munching] Stop eating that apple! [breathing heavily] [swallows] [yells] [gunshot] ♪ Oh, hello there, Dalton. Hey, there, Butterfly. You know you have someone shooting at you? I can see that, Butterfly, but thank you. [gunshots] ♪ [whooshing] [bang] ♪ Ow! Shit! [footsteps] ♪ [laughs maliciously] Well, Mr. Dalton, I guess you're gonna be the hero known for killing Two Eyed Jack. Nah, I got something much worse in store for you, Jack. I'm gonna take you in, sit you down in the middle of a cell, and for the rest of your-- Oh, shit! - Oh, my f-ing God! - Shit, shit! Shit! What the hell is wrong with you? It was an accident, Slim. I didn't mean to do that. You shot the man during the lesson speech. No, I was just trying to scare him and my finger slipped. You don't shoot a man during the lesson speech. - Oh, my God! - Hey, there, Finch. - Dalton, you're alive! - Yeah, I'm alive! Mr. Dalton! My heart rate hasn't been this high in a long time. I don't know what you just said there, Mayor. Dalton! That was so scary. I'm so glad to see you. It's good to see you, Gail. Yeah. Yeah, I'm okay, everybody. Thanks for all the concern. The chuck-wagon! The chuck-wagon! [all cheering] Hey! Hey, wait, everybody! Now I really don't think that's a chuck-wagon. They threatened to kill us all with this doomsday device. Dalton, maybe we should check this out. Let's do it, Finch. Now, now, just wait a minute here, boys. With me being Sheriff now, I think we should let somebody a little more qualified handle this. Step aside. All right now, you dirty banditos. You see this nice, shiny-- [zapping] [thud] [all gasping] I don't think that's a chuck-wagon. Kill everyone! Bring me the doomsday device! [rattling] - Take cover, everybody! - [all screaming] [explosion] Dalton, you gotta get us out of here. We're sitting ducks. - Door should be open, Bill. - What? Yeah, I never did get that key, so just go ahead and push it open. [all laughing maliciously] [guns cocking] Well, Finch, looks like we're outnumbered. Yeah, I can see that. Watch my back, I'm going out. [gunshots] ♪ So, are you gonna get something or not? You sell these barrels? No. The barrels just hold the products. What do you want? I really want a barrel. Look, we're trying to close. [gunshots and zapping] Say adios, amigo. Adios, amigo. Thank you, Slim. This shit's getting weird. Lights out, you son of a bitch. Oh! What the hell? I didn't know you started using a whip! There's a lot of things you don't know about me, Pete. Yeah, like you, uh, being a songwriter. You know what? I am a songwriter. Shit, Pete. Isn't there something you always wanted to do, something deep down inside that you just wanted to follow? No. I like being an outlaw. Oh, bullshit, Pete. That was always Frank's thing. I can see it in your eyes, Pete. There's something else. Well-- I always wanted to be a dancer. [gasps] Damn it, Pete, you be the best dancer you can be. - Is it too late? - Man, it's not too late. Everybody, this is my brother Pete. That's me. My dancing brother Pete. - I'm a dancer! - You little dancer... [zapping] Damn! These boys just keep coming. Hey, Dalton, up here, man. Oh, hey, vulture. You know it'd be a good idea if you took out that chuck-wagon. That's a good idea. I appreciate that. Who the hell are you talking to, son? Cover me, Slim.

Take 'em out, Finch. [explosion] Whoa! Hey, Finch, go ahead and say it. Say what? - What is-- What-- What? - What? Mr. Dalton, we gotta get out of here! The whole town's on fire! All right, everybody grab a bucket, get some water. We need to put these fires out. Son, this fire's too big. There' nothing we can do. Yeah, but it's Toonstone! I-- It's our home!

I'm trying to give a speech. What can I say? We're all lucky to still be alive today. But we're even more lucky to have a town full of so many heroes. Like Slim, Finch, Acondo, with that amazing rain-dance. Hell, even Bill and Pete helped out. Let's not forget Dark Owl. I wish we could thank him somehow. I'm sure he knows, Tom. And each and every one of you who makes this town what it is. You see, when I left the farm to follow my dreams, those dreams led me here. And now my dreams are telling me something different. Which is why I'm stepping down as Sheriff. [all gasping] Now, now, hold on, hold on. There's a better man for the job. Hell, he even saved my life a few times. Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to introduce to you, if you'll have him, Sheriff Finch. [all exclaiming] Wow! - Wow, um-- - Hey, speech! I would be honored if, of course, the people of Toonstone will have me. - Dalton. - Hey, Gail. Hi, um, I'll just go for it. Um, we had a conversation the other day. - Yeah. - And, you know, I-- I thought I felt a little something. And then, you know, I read the article and I really didn't expect to feel like I did when I thought that you were gone. But now, you're back and I-- - Uh-huh. - I just-- I think you're really great. And I really think that-- I don't know, maybe, we could be really great together. Oh! You and me? Yeah, you know, we talked about things. Yeah, yeah. Oh. The thing is, uh-- - When I met you-- - Mmm-hmm. - You were a good bit bitchy. - Oh. And my dad, you know, he told me when I was younger that a woman never gets less bitchy through time. - Mmm-hmm. - And you know, like, with you, 10 years from now I could only imagine what the bitch level would get to, you know. Hell no, I can't-- Then we're friends, too. And I don't wanna ruin what we have. So-- Friends? Uh-- Friends. Awesome, Gail, you are something else, you know? Uh-- I'm sorry-- Dalton! Where are you going? Finch, I think I'm gonna take my music on the road for a little while. Maybe take down a bad guy or two on the way. Oh, well, hey, wait, Slim, are you leaving, too? Yup. Ain't no outlaws around here any more, son. I'm gonna follow this boy and get into some trouble. What if we need you, Dalton? If you need me just go ahead and tell the land. And I'll hear it.
