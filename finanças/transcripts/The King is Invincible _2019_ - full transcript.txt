Thank you for letting me win. Take a sip. I never drink. You think by not drinking, you will keep sober, while alcohol will definitely get you drunk? What do you mean? The world is in chaos. There shouldn’t be only one people staying sober. If the people are sober, the whole country will wake up. Wong Fei-hung, remember this, if the people are strong, the whole country will become strong. This is the responsibility of people pursuing martial art. Everyone, listen to me. As people who pursue martial art, we not only need to build our physical fitness so as to fight against the foreign enemies, but more importantly, and to contribute to the well-being of our country. To achieve this, we need talent, efforts, and the help of martial master. Do you know who this master is? Wong Fei-hung. Yes. Today my master opens martial club here and take you as apprentices for free. Everyone can sign up. Great! Miss, you are the most beautiful bride I’ve ever seen. Look over here. Sorry. Please hold on. Rickshaw. Qi. Hurry up. You didn’t let me say anything just now. Now you blame me for telling you. Now you are in a hurry. Mrs. Wong. Shaojun. Turn around. Shaojun, Watch out! Where is the carter? Go! Shaojun. Master, A Japanese. Save him first. Qi, remember to change his dressing regularly. Ok. Shaojun. I waited for you for such a long time. But you didn’t come to comfort me. Is everyone else more important than me? I… Shaojun. Shaojun. Poor master. Shaojun. Shaojun. Let me explain. Today, the general commander invited me to talk about important things. I didn’t do it on purpose. You have excuses every time. I waited for you for very long Do you even love me or not? I… Shaojun, of course I love you. I already planned about our wedding. And you still missed our appointment. What did you plan about? Of course I have a plan. Look, our wedding must be of western style. On the wedding day, I will put flowers all over the church, and prepare the best wines. Our families and friends will put on western-style clothes. So will I. You just need to put on your wedding dress and wait for me in Baozhilin drugstore. I will pick you up on a tall horse. No, an imported horse. Don’t ride a horse. It’s neither Chinese-style nor western-style. It will look hideous. Now you’ve made a promise. If you don’t show up tomorrow, I will never see you again. Shaojun,. You have my word. I swear, I will cancel all my other appointments tomorrow to be with you. I forgive you this time. But remember, don’t do that again. You have my word. You didn’t see it. The wedding dress in the photo studio today is really beautiful. It will match perfectly with the suit that I’ve sent you. You’ve always had a fine taste. Master, the general commander wants to see you. What for? Emergency. Go ahead. Don’t be late. Don’t worry. The World’s Treasure Fair held by Guangzhou municipal government has been confirmed. The empress attaches great importance to it after she knew it. So she sent imperial bodyguards to escort the national treasure Picture of the Black Dragon to the fair at night. When the guys I sent to pick them up arrived, all of them were dead and the Picture of the Black Dragon was gone, too. Master Wong, It’s a trivial thing to die But the Picture of the Black Dragon is a national treasure of over 600 years of history. I have a clue. Master Wong, he was still here just now. Master, what’s the fastest way to leave Guangzhou? There is a passenger ship to Shanghai in half an hour. He was hurt, so he wouldn’t go too far. Take my order, block the entire city. Yes. Master Wong, I entrust you with this. Here. Help me out. Okay. Stop. Stop. My child! The ship is coming. Wong Fei-hung. You missed our appointment again. You really don’t love me at all. I don’t have to wait for you anymore. You fail to keep your promise, but I will keep mine. I’m heading for Shanghai this time, and I will never come back. Don’t come to look for me. Bye. Master. Pack my things. I will leave for Shanghai. Mrs. Wong said you were not allowed to go to find her. Go to pick the suit that Shaojun gave me. Master. Master. Shanghai is so big. How can we find Mrs. Wong? Shaojun mentioned that she had a friend who ran a foreign bank in Shanghai. How can we find her? It’s the axe gang. Hurry! What’s the matter? The car is parked. Move. Let’s go. Screw you. Kun. Let’s go. Thank you for saving me. It’s nothing. If it’s convenient for you, please come to my place for dinner. Okay. No need. We have things to do. We are not going to bother you. Qi, let’s go. Master. She is a girl. Think about it. What if those bad guys come back to her again after we leave? Plus, I’m hungry. Eh, Don’t mind us bothering you. Great. My brother runs a restaurant. I believe you’ll love it. Yizuo, we didn’t expect this journey to be so dangerous. Fortunately, the picture remains intact. Thanks. Well, people in the wharf were so detestable. How dare they rob us? If they got the evidence, then we… I’ve already send people to deal with the axe gang. You just focus on healing your wounds. Mr. Wong, this way. Shaojun, it seems to be a long time since the last time you drank. I miss the time when I didn’t need to drink. Shaojun, I hope you can be happy. You have to know, there are many things that are as beautiful as wine. We can’t be immutable. That’s right. I came to Shanghai for change. You’ve come to the right place. Shanghai is changing. Now, more and more Chinese are buying gramophones and telephones. These imported goods are in short supply. I didn’t expect, you really achieved what we said we were going to do in school. To introduce Chinese culture to the world, and bring technology and culture from the western world to China. You are doing an amazing thing. I’m flattered. Mr. Wong, thank you for saving Xinzi today. It’s nothing. Both Chinese people and foreigners gather here in Shanghai. People from different countries should get along with each other. Mr. Wong has just come to Shanghai. If you need any help, just come to me. No need. Thank you for that. Please. Forgive me, I can’t eat raw food. I admire your chivalry. I hope we can become good friends later. That’s for the best. Your sashimi tastes great. Tonight, let’s drink till all’s blue. I never drink. Mr. Kozan, Let’s drink. Mr. Kozan, thanks for your hospitality. Unfortunately, we still have things to do. We are sorry we can’t stay here for long. Let me show you the way out. Why didn’t you kill them? He saved Xinzi. I didn’t want to do it in front of my sister. But we can’t let this man stay alive. Master Jiu, we found him. He went to Kozan’s restaurant last night. Now he is in Foreign Bank of West Asia. Keep a close watch on him. Yes. Master, What kind of drink is this? It’s not even as good as our radix isatidis. Ok. What do you think of my place? I think it’s great. Boss, Miss Shaojun, Two friends of yours from Guangzhou are waiting. Shaojun. Guangzhou. Mrs. Wong. Shaojun. Mrs. Wong. I finally get to see you. What are you doing here? Didn’t I forbid you to come? I… Told you. Mrs. Wong, I’ve told Master that. But he wouldn’t listen. He must come. This must be Mr. Wong. I’ve heard a lot about you. And you are? I’m Shaojun’s classmate, Peter. Hello, I’m my master’s apprentice, Qi. Hello, Qi. Your apprentice has such a strong grip. Mr. Peter, thank you for taking care of Shaojun. No need. Who are you to me? Shaojun, I… Mr. Wong, I assume you haven’t had breakfast. Tang Wu, make a reservation at the best restaurant. I’ll give a reception for Mr. Wong and Qi. Shaojun. Master, he is not as handsome as you. But, they do make a cute couple when standing together. Go fetch me my suit. Hello, Who is going to order? This way. Qi. I’ll have pork stomach and chicken. What chicken? I’ll have steak. Medium-well. I’ll have a medium-rare steak. Thanks. We want a 90% rare. You have such a fine taste. Ok, sir. Which year do you want for you wine? This year. Give me two cups of 1862 wine. Thank you. Mr.Wong, this must be your first time to come to Shanghai. Why don’t you stay here longer so I can do the honours well? This is China. It’s me that should do the honours. Wong Fei-hung. Peter is my classmate. I don’t want you to be hostile toward him. I… Shaojun, It’s okay. Mr. Wong is right. I wasn’t being considerate. I like your friend’s attitude. You… Wong Fei-hung, Did you just come to Shanghai to irritate me? Shaojun, I came here to take you home. But I don’t want to. That’s all right. Master has something else to do. Qi, what is your master going to do here? Master wants to find this. Qi. What’s this? Wong Fei-hung, you really came here for something else. I don’t want to see you anymore. Shaojun. Mrs. Wong. I’m sorry. I’ve been a bad host. Mr. Wong, why don’t you come to stay in my house for several days? No need. Ok. Please help yourself. I’ll go talk to Shaojun. We’ve searching for it the whole day and still found nothing. Mrs. Wong didn’t want to see us either. Master, What on earth did you do? Master, what should we do now? Maybe we can go to Miss Xinzi. Do you know what my biggest mistake is this time? What is it? It’s bringing you here. Master. Qi, watch out. Ok. Master. They are Japanese. Let’s go. Master! Qi! Qi! How are you? Qi! Help! Doctor, help! Doctor! Mr. Wong, what happened to Qi? It’s you. Save him! Mr. Wong, luckily, you sent him here in time. Otherwise, Qi will be dead. Belladonnae. That’s right. This is a cardiac stimulant mainly for patients who are dying. But if it’s injected into healthy people, it will become fatal poison. But luckily, he was treated in time. He will be fine after tonight. It this drug popular? No. It’s strictly regulated, and still in testing phase. Therefore, in Shanghai, only this hospital has the drug. Could you show me the drug? Mr. Wong. What are you doing here? Where is the drug? Drug? What drug? Belladonnae. I don’t know. I have no idea. This is a life-and-death matter. You can’t shoulder the responsibility. It’s the axe gang. Mr. Wong The drug is here. You really are on the same side. Guys, go get them. Even if you kill me, Master Jiu won’t let you go. That’s great. I happen to want to meet your Master Jiu. Brother Kun, are you okay? I admire your gut. Thanks. Is the Picture of the Black Dragon related with Master Jiu? You hurt my guys so many times. I’m afraid you’ll have to pay for that first. What do you mean? Let me see what you got. Hung Kuen. Insightful. Master Jiu, Kill him! Kill him! Shadowless kick. You are Wong Fei-hung. Exactly. Master Wong is a young hero. Why are you in collusion with the Japanese? I don’t mind the nationality of my friends. I only care if they are good or evil. It’s hard to tell whether someone is good or evil. Master Jiu! Master Jiu! What… What happened? Master Jiu is dead! Wong Fei-hung killed Master Jiu. Kill him! I heard, someone picked a quarrel here. Is it you? This is our axe gang’s personal business. For me, there is no personal business. Take him away. Brother Kun. We can’t let him go. Let him go. Brother Kun. Let him go. Fei-hung. Master. Shaojun. Master. Are you ok? I’m ok. Shaojun, why are you here? You are not mad at me? Qi told me, you were almost killed last night. The police station called and told me you committed a murder. What happened? It’s a long story. I’ll tell you after I get out of here. Let’s go, pals. Let’s go. These people will get in trouble. Go. Qi, how many jailors did you see when you came in? Jailors? I didn’t see any jailors. Take Shaojun out of here, quick! You can’t stay here. Master! Go! Fei-hung! Mrs. Wong! Let’s get out of here. What happened? Fei-hung. Wong Fei-hung. If you move one more time, I’ll kill her. Let her go. It has nothing to do with her. You killed Master Jiu. You must pay with blood. Master Jiu’s death isn’t as simple as it looks. Give me some time, and I will find it out. By then I will give you an explanation. Brother Kun, don’t trust him. Ok. I’ll give you one day. Let’s go. Don’t worry. I won’t kill woman. Fei-hung won’t spare you. But if he doesn’t show up, I’m going to have to give them a solution. Take her away. I’m sorry. Please give me one more chance. I’ll kill Wong Fei-hung. Wong Fei-hung. Of course we need to kill him. But now the most important thing is to save Shaojun. I don’t want her to get hurt any more. Yes. I won’t let you down. Master, how did you know Master Jiu’s death is an accident? Master Jiu is good at playing Hungkuen. He is very steady. He won’t get tumbled down by a kick of me. There must be a reason for it. A poisonous needle. Will he come or not? Is he going to fool us? Exactly. We might just kill that woman. Damn it! It’s been one day. Will Wong Fei-hung show up or not? He has probably run away. We’d better kill that woman to revenge for Master Jiu. Yeah. Revenge for Master Jiu. Take that woman here. Brother Kun. What’s wrong? The liquor is poisonous. The liquor is poisonous. The poison is really good. It’s you. It’s me. Why not take the fortune when it is coming for you? You are the stubborn one. You take what’s important for the Japanese. They came to me. Of course I’ll help. Master. They are poisoned too. Master Wong, what happened? Where’s Shaojun? He was taken away by Kozan. Kozan, Qi, Hurry up and take them to the hospital. We are like the meat on their chopping block, totally at their mercy. Mr. Wong, please. This is not what I wanted. Finish eating first. What excellent Kung Fu. Hand over Shaojun and the Picture of the Black Dragon. Mr. Wong, this is a trap. Leave here quickly. Mr. Wong, Wong Fei-hung, you are trapped. Wong Fei-hung we meet again. Stop. Step aside. Step aside. Step aside. Xinzi, what are you doing? Xinzi. Mr. Wong, I’m sorry. Brother, let go of him. Xinzi. Mr. Wong. Leave here quickly. Unless you leave here too. Go. Stop chasing them. Shaojun, Shaojun, Peter, Sorry. Shaojun, Whatever Mr. Wong can do, I can do it too. Go to Canada with me. It is more suitable for you Peter, Thank you for risking your life to save me. But we are just friends It seems that you still care about him. Do not worry. I have sent Tang Wu to find him. Mr. Wong is a master of martial art. He’ll be okay. Thank you, peter. By the way, there is a trade conference tomorrow. I hope that you can go with me. Shaojun. Look, all these people here want to do business with foreigners. Congratulations, Peter. You are doing something that I want to but I can't. Boss, everyone is here. Shaojun, please excuse me. Ladies and gentlemen, good evening, everyone. I am Peter from Foreign Bank of West Asia. Today, I invited everyone to share you a piece of good news. From tomorrow, the route from Shanghai to Canada is officially opened up. Every trader present can transport goods through this route, thus gaining greater trade resources. However, I personally have a small request. Promoting cultural exchanges between China and foreign countries is my long-cherished wish. So I hope that everyone here can offer me a little convenience. That is to give me a warehouse for free on every merchant ship in the future. And I will return 10% of the profits to each merchant. I don’t know what you think of it. Wait. Mr. Wong, Don’t believe him. That guy is a liar. His real purpose is to use our Chinese merchant ships to smuggle our national treasures. Mr. Wong, what are you talking about? I’m a little confused. Stop acting. Wasn’t the Picture of the Black Dragon stolen by someone you sent? Mr. Wong, you need evidence to accuse someone. You could say it was me, but you could also say it was Tom or Jack, or any one present. Am I right? I can testify that. About everything you do, I don’t think anyone knows better than me. Outwardly you are a businessman, but in fact you are ruthless, murderous, and a cultural relics smuggler. Are you going to deny all of this? Enough. Shaojun, are you ok? Wong Fei-hung, what are you here for today? Are you jealous of Peter? When I came to Shanghai, it was Peter who took me in. When I was kidnapped, he saved me. Now, he is trying to bring Chinese goods abroad, but you brought an inexplicable woman to mess things up. What do you want exactly? Shaojun, you misunderstood me. Wong Fei-hung, stop talking. I am so disappointed with you. Who is this? Kick him out. You are not welcomed here. Get out. Get him out. Get out. Kick him out. They will not believe you when you have no evidence. Let’s go. Mr. Wong, Shaojun, I know that you are in a bad mood now. But I think you really need to go out and take a walk. Go with me to Canada. You will fall in love with that place. And my foreign bank also needs your assistance Master, Master Wong, I know the location of the dock where they hide the treasures. You. I’m referring to you. Do you know how to work? What’s your problem? Can you do it or not? And you. Can you work at all? Hurry up. And you. What’s your problem? Are you up to the work? Hurry up. Wong Fei-hung, I didn’t expect that the Chinese are also not afraid of death. Chinese people are certainly not afraid of death. Master Jiu, I got some sleep and how it came to this? Who are you? It doesn’t matter who I am. The thing is you’ll get in trouble. Damn it. Why do you young people play with fire? Master. I’m old. It’s good to be young. You can still stand after fighting so long. Mr. Wong, We've been taken in. This warehouse is a fake one. Peter left from the other port with Miss. Shisan. Master, Mr. Wong, Mr. Wong, Forgive me for leaving without saying goodbye. Your cruelty to the Chinese makes me ashamed to face you again. I have decided to devote myself to the study of medical skill to help more Chinese people. Take care, my master. Have some tea. You brat. Wine is good. But you didn’t drink it the right way. Brats, listen to me. Your body can be drunk, but your mind can not; your mind can be drunk, but your soul can not; your soul can be drunk, but not your heart. Then you will know the taste of wine. In this world, shamming drunk is harder than shamming sober. But if you disguise yourself for a long time, you’ll really get drunk. If a man loses something, he must find it himself. If his country lose something, as a man, he has to get it back too. Mater, are we going to save Mrs. Wong or get back the Painting? To save my wife and get back the Painting as well. Qi. Master, I adore this painting. This is the most delicate copy I have ever seen. Otherwise why is it here? Shaojun, I fell in love with you at first sight when I saw you in the UK. Peter, what what are you doing? I am solemnly proposing to you. Please marry me. Peter, we are just friends. Shaojun. You know my feeling to you. When we met again in Shanghai, I was sure that was fate. I cannot live without you Peter, you should know I can’t say yes. Shaojun, I’m sorry. So it’s you. Yes. Sorry, Shaojun. But trust me. My love for you is like every painting in this room. All of them are genuine. You are a robber. I didn't expect you to be responsible for everything. You will be punished. Do you still expect Wong Fei-hung to save you? This painting is always mine. Just like, you are mine too Let go of me. You let go of me. Boss, Wong Fei-hung is here. Fei-hung. Since he wants to be a hero, I’ll give him the chance. Wong Fei-hung, you can have Miss Shisan and the Picture of the Black Dragon on condition that you can win out in this match. Shaojun, for your sake, I’ll give Wong Fei-hung this chance to win out fairly. Scoundrel. It seems that this is all Wong Fei-hung has got. Master. Master. Master. Master. Fei-hung. Fei-hung. Fei-hung. Fei-hung, wake up. Wake up. Look at me, Fei-hung. I’ll go back with you, Fei-hung, I didn’t expect that were so many treasures. How is it? Are you satisfied? Guard Tang. Boss, what does that mean? How come you know Kung Fu? I know you, but you don’t know me. I have been thinking why Wong Fei-hung has repeatedly escaped and could even find me here. It is you. You’re right. Peter, you have smuggled our treasures and murdered my fellow countrymen for many years. Today, I am to bring you to justice on behalf of our Qing Dynasty. Do you have anything else to say? Tang Wu, I’m late. You’re alive. Chinese martial arts are profound, and how can you understand it? You are a Chinese. Do you know what you are doing? Of course I do. The rise and fall of the country is the responsibility of every one. Qi, take care of your Mrs. Wong. Tang Wu, I’ll entrust Mrs. Wong to you. Don’t fantasize about harassing my Master’s wife. Qi, Qi. I can fight a bear, let alone you. Qi. Fei-hung, I’m going to see how long you can keep bleeding out. No! You will die. Shaojun, don’t be afraid. I promise I will take you home. Fei-hung. Shaojun, let’s go home. Master Wong, Master Wong, Look here. Come closer. Yes. Master Wong, be cheerful. Don’t be so restrained. Come closer. Ok, ok, ok. Show some intimacy. Show some intimacy. Ok. My heart aches for my country. I am back to ordinary. Under the boundless sky, sad music resoundes in the world. Transient is the sound of fighting. Who is the loyal soul? Love and hatred vanish in a blink of an eye, in a blink of an eye. Dust settles in the water and clouds. The tide ebbs and flows. Warriors are struggling with blood gushing out. Rivers and lakes are at the foot. Look at the mountains and rivers in the clouds. How many thrills are there on the way back? A true hero is passionate and chivalrous. Tiger and Crane Fist sees justice done; and I-shape and Crouching Tiger Fist hold up the sky. Abiding by the principles of The Grandmaster, the hatred of the country and one’s own mission should be kept in mind. I am like a wandering sand and become the dust of China, revealing my loyalty. Men should keep in mind their home and country. Be a hero and govern the world. Iron horses tread over rivers and mountains. Love and hatred vanish in a blink of an eye, in a blink of an eye. Dust settles in the water and clouds. The tide ebbs and flows. Warriors are struggling with blood gushing out. Rivers and lakes are at the foot. Look at the mountains and rivers in the clouds. How many thrills are there on the way back? A true hero is passionate and chivalrous. Tiger and Crane Fist sees justice done; and I-shape and Crouching Tiger Fist hold up the sky. Abiding by the principles of The Grandmaster, the hatred of the country and one’s own mission should be kept in mind.
