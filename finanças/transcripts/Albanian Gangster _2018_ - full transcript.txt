Alright, lemme tell you a story. The first time I've been to a funeral, my father takes me. Somebody killed our cousin over some kind of drug deal. Put a bullet in his head. So, we go to the funeral and... First funeral I've been to, and I've seen my cousin. You couldn't even recognize him, his head was this big. I've never seen my father so upset in my life, ever. At that funeral. I mean, he was... You could see it in his eyes, he was pissed, so, I'm at football practice one day. I played football for my high school. So, I'm at football practice, I was about 15 years old. My coach comes up to me, he says, "Hey, you have to leave." I'm like, "What happened," he goes, "Your father's here." I said, "Alright." So I go, I get dressed in the locker room, I go outside. I see my father out there, he's like, "Come on." "Come on, my boy." I'm like, "Where we goin', pop?" He goes, "Don't worry about it." So, we pull up somewhere, we stop. And I just looked at him, I'll never forget. He just stared. He just looked at me and stared at me for a couple of seconds. And I was like, what the hell's going on, you know? He goes, "Listen, my boy." He goes in the backseat, he pulls up this blanket that he had, a fucking shotgun in the backseat. He goes, "This is where the guy, who killed our cousin is." He goes, "I want you to see" "what happens when somebody kills somebody," "or does something to somebody you love, or our family." And now me inside... Outside I'm cool, you know, I'm a cool customer outside, inside, I'm shaking, but not from fear. It wasn't from fear, it was excitement. I was happy, like I was proud to be doing this with my father, you know what I mean? He was like God to me, you know. We wait, I'll never forget the look in his eyes, man. He was like a lion on a gazelle, man. He was locked, like locked in. We're waiting, we wait, and we wait about three hours. Nothing happens, you know. We're waiting and waiting, he goes, "Alright, forget about him." Next day, I'm at football practice again. "Koja, listen, your uncle's here to pick you up." "My uncle?" I'm like, what the hell's going on? We go back to my house. Everybody's here: Uncles, cousins, everybody. So my grandfather and my uncles take me into the room, me and my brother, and they tell us, "Listen, your father is not coming back for a while." So right away I knew what happened. My brother didn't really know what happened, and then it was all over, he went away. He went and blew the guy's chest out with a shotgun. This is what you do. If somebody does something to your family, somebody kills somebody and disrespects your last name, or your people, you do what you have to do. You sacrifice yourself, no matter what. (dramatic music) (hip-hop music) - (woman moaning) - Oh shit. What the fuck, bro, you gonna wake up my mother. You better shut up. 'Sup sweetheart? - What, you want a cigarette? - Yeah. Alright. Buff me up. Call your guy. - Huh? - Call your boy. Call him? What's up, man? Two weeks I'm waiting over here? Man, I told you, I really don't know what to say... Yo, are you fucking selling me fairytales, bro? Do I gotta fucking come to Brooklyn? Do I gotta fucking come to... Yo, talk to this motherfucker, - he's your boy. - I don't wanna talk to him. - It's the same story. - Talk to him. - Every time. - Tell him, don't make us come to fucking Brooklyn. What day you gonna be able to see me? It's sunny out there. They say there's gonna be a hurricane. - Here's breakfast. - I gotta get outta here. That's how you do that. Yo, get this fucking bitch outta here, bro. We gotta get ready, bro. She's putting her shoes on, dude. Alright, I don't give a fuck! I'm waiting on you, dude, I'm waiting on you. You're telling me, I'm the only reason you're here. Alright, the only reason I'm here's 'cause of you, alright? Am I that important? You see this fucking shit I gotta deal with? This fucking retarded crackhead motherfucker. I gotta get outta this. Yeah, listen, fuck that shit. I texted this girl last night. She's not answering me. I see my mother, the way she looks at all my nephews, and then she looks at me, (scoffs) no kids, 47. The only one I want, I can't fucking get. I don't understand what the problem is here. I think, you know what the problem is? I know what the problem is. She doesn't like what we're doing, what I do. You know what I mean? I just wanna have a kid with that girl and come home. Ma, here, take this baby and take care of him for me. (upbeat music) Yo, can we get a round of drinks for the boys? How you doing, bro? Alright, man. (people chatting) (sirens blaring) What they want over here? Don't fucking leave nobody alone, huh. - What, the cops? - Yeah. - Pussies. - Bitch ass niggas. - Thank you guys, thank you. (laughing) - They left. - Yeah, they left, they left. Thank God they didn't tow the car. Thank God they didn't tow me, dude. 'The fuck outta here. Yo, more drinks please. Bring the fucking bottle! Come on, I know you don't need a drink. Take a seat, take a seat. My wife's killing me enough. I don't need a fucking cancer stick. Yeah, that's why I'm not fucking married, dude. You guys are the guys I'm married to. - You guys. - He goes, "Yo, my wife?" You, you, you, you, you, you, and you. Alright, we gotta speak Italian over here. 'Cause I got my paisano over here. We got the paisano over here! What are you doing, Vinny? This fucking guy scuffed my brand new sneakers. Who, Vinny? Albanians don't like this fucking kid. Neither do the Italians. And he's Italian. - Fuck him. - But I like him. He's my number one right now. Always a good time with you guys. Nobody likes that. I think I can do pretty much whatever I want. He actually does think he can do whatever he wants to do. - Whenever he wants to do it. - I don't really think it. I do pretty much whatever I want. - Whenever. - Yeah, he does. Wherever. I tell him, "Don't do it," he still does it. He's bad news this kid. People need to act accordingly. Looks a little short. Go in the bathroom and look at it. This is what it is. I'd rather have him than a hundred Albanians that I know. But then I'd rather have 100 Albanians more than 100 guineas, or one guinea or two. I'm his role model. For about 10 minutes of the day. Come here, gimme a kiss, baby. Get the fuck outta here. Come here. Oh you wanna give me a hug? (Laughing) What the fuck are you doing - with the fucking paisan? - Yo, he's my paisan, bro. He's mine. He's mine, he's my nephew. - He adopted me as his uncle. - Hey, hey, he's with you. Yo, Leon, if you vouch for Vinny, he's good with us. Let me tell you something about that kid: - He's with me, that's it. - How can I trust him? He scuffed my sneakers! (men laughing) - Big fucking deal, bro. (all laughing) You better fucking laugh. Who the fuck is this? Alright. Yo. - Yo we gotta get outta here. - What happened? The fucking, the fucking Waterbug. I been looking for that motherfucker. Yo, lemme know who. This kid's making me sweat balls 'cause he's wearing a sweater over here. Dude, I'm fucking dying myself. - All right, I got you. - Yo chill the fuck out, bro. The masseuse was rougher last night, huh? - Oh my God. - Ahh, shut up. How's your ass feel from the Chinese lady? She got pretty close to my butthole. She gave you the shiatsu fucking massage? Leon, Leon, there he is. (hip-hop music) Where the fuck you been hiding? Come over here. Get your ass over here, huh. Where's his money? Where the fuck have you been, man? - I was working right here. - Where you been? Put your fucking hands down. Put your hands down motherfucker. Put your hands down. Put your hands down! I will pay you. Why you picking up your fucking hands? - I'm sorry. - You gonna pay him his money? - Fuck you motherfucker. - Where's his fucking money? Put him in the fucking trunk. You got my fucking number? - I don't... - You don't got my fuck... Yo, you wanna get in the trunk right now? Yeah, let's put him in the trunk. Last place you ever gonna be in, right.

Keep it fucking moving. Pussy ass motherfucker. (hip-hop music) (transitions to mellow music) - Where you going? - What's happening? - How you guys doing? - Hi. - Good morning. - How are you? Hello. Hi, where'd you guys come from? Jimmy, can I have a Jack and a coke, please? What are you doing here? - Uh, just chilling here. - Drinking? - Drinking... - Yeah? Can I buy you a drink or something? Yeah, when this is done. Yo, all night... Miss me? - Miss you? - Yeah. With every bullet, right? Yeah, with every fiber of my being. I'm joking, I'm sorry if I'm being... - It's all good, chill. - Okay. - Now I'm chilling. - Good. I'm gonna chill even more. You need to get a drink. Yeah, I'm definitely getting a drink. - Yeah. - Cheers. Cheers. I'm sorry. They say I come off a little too aggressive. - What do you think? - A little aggressive. You like that? - Um, (chuckling) you make me nervous. I think I make everybody nervous, including myself. You actually calm me down. I don't usually sweet-talk too many people, but you, I can't help it. So. (laughing) Sorry, am I pouring it on too thick? - A little too thick. - Just a little? Lay off the hot sauce, man. You got me sweating right now. I'm sweating like one of my friends. Yo, just stop me if I'm being rude. (mellow music) Watch your step. There you go. I knew it. I'm putting your keys right here, alright? - Thanks for taking me home. - Drink this. Yeah. Nope, not that. This. You have a good time tonight? Yeah. I'm really happy you had a good time tonight. I want you to make yourself comfortable. I am comfortable. Nah, you don't look comfortable. - Here, sit down. - No, I don't wanna sit. - Why not? - I like to stand. - Are you staying? - Are you gonna straighten... Get the... - What? - Back off. What do you want me to do? - You're here. - I want you to sit down. Yeah, I'm gonna sit down right now. - Sit down. - Look. Seriously, no, come on, come on. - I gotta go. - Relax, why you so uptight? I'm not uptight. I just wanted to make sure you're okay, and now I'm going. I think I'm not okay. You can't leave. I'm definitely not okay right now. You're coming on too strong. I'm not coming on too strong. I'm trying to make you comfortable. Welcome to my home. Thanks. I gotta go now. I gotta go. I'll never understand women, especially you. I've been trying so hard. Stay. Maybe you need to try a little harder. I'm trying as hard as I can. I'm doing everything I know how to do. Drink the water. - Get over there. - I gotta go. - You ain't going nowhere. - I am going. Come on, please. (Leon laughing) - Stay. - You're making me stay? Stay for me. - You're making me stay? - I'll be nice, I promise you. I'll be nice. You know I got respect for you. Let me go, I gotta go. I'm not letting you go nowhere. Get off me. Get the fuck off of me! Whoa, she's crazy. Drink your fucking water. Why you gonna be like that? (mellow music) Leon. Yo. Yo. Yo. You awake? - Yeah, man. - What's up, Leon? Get the fuck outta here. Get up, man. What's happening? You shot? Well I'm a little younger than Leon, like 10 years or something like that younger than him. So, when I was... Just a little. Just a little bit. So, when we were growing up, you know, we were little kids running around, and these guys were older than us, and you know, each generation's more crazier than the last. So when we were growing up, watching Leon and these older other guys, they were doing crazy shit, man, I mean they were really sick bastards, bro. So when you were a little kid, that's who you wanted to be, you know, you look at them, and, you know, that's who you want to be like. So, when we got to a certain age, older, it was tough, because we grew up, it was all projects, all black people, you know, all Spanish people, and we're the only white kids there. 'Cause Albanians, when they came from back home, they were all poor, you know, no money. So they all took jobs as supers. And everybody migrated to Pelham Parkway, or Mosholu Parkway, that's where all of us were. So we ended up, we just stuck together, and we just made a name for ourselves, because... Cuz, we had to fucking destroy motherfuckers - to know who we are. - Yes. Because we're here and we're not going nowhere. We're from north Albania, you know. We're Malsors, that's what we're called, all right. There is no Albania without no Malsor. The Ottoman Empire came in and invaded Albania, and for 500 years, they had us under their fucking boot. They didn't have us. Well, they had, they still had us, they had Albania under their fucking boot. And what they did is... That's why Albania now is the only European country that the majority is Muslim. But we're Catholic, you know. We stood in the mountains, and we fought. We fought. We fought 'em back, for 500 years we fought 'em back. Then after the fucking Ottoman Empire, then the Serbs. The Serbs, a hundred years, they fuckin'... The Serbs. Always at war, our whole history is just at war... The Greeks. The Italians. That's why we're so... The Nazis. That's why we're so hot-blooded, that's why we're so... You know what I mean? That's why we don't back down an inch from nobody. Yeah. We laid down the fucking law. Yeah we did. That's what we did. We went through some crazy shit, bro. We definitely did. Generation after generation. Everywhere you look, you see three Albanians, one black guy, one Spanish guy. When I grew up here, you see 300 black guys, 300 Spanish guys. You saw one Albanian. You sat there and talked to him for an hour even if you didn't know who the fuck he was. Growing up, I was scared to come around here 'cause they were gonna jump me. Now? I do whatever I want. And so do the rest of us. There's nothing I didn't do in this neighborhood. There's nothing I won't do in this neighborhood now. (mellow music) You were fucking Vinny the other night, and now you're hugging up on me, huh? - Come on. - How do you know that? How do I know that. Of course I know that. - Who told you? - Huh? A little bird came down from the sky and told me. Sorry, I'm trying to break away from you. (mellow guitar music) So then why are you all up on it? I'm not all up on it. - She's all up on me. - Yes but you're not like, yo. You're like, "Ooh, okay." Okay, but whose baby is that in your stomach? I don't know. But if it's yours, I would expect for you to treat me better, - and this is not a good sign. - I don't know if it's mine. (mellow guitar music) I'm sorry, gimme a hug. Look at that. That's what I want. - You want babies? - Yeah. You know with who. - No. - I want a baby with you. Wow. Listen, I um... I've been in hell all this time. I don't know, I am so, so... Like I feel like you're a magnet to me. I feel like I need you. And I believe I need you. I think you're beautiful. What kind of shit is going on here, man? Cuz, they do this every night. Every single night they do this, cuz. They bust peoples' balls, it's crazy dude. Look, just for a couple people hanging out, look what they do. They block the whole fucking block. This is an Albanian neighborhood, cuz. What do you think they fucking doing? Fuck these cops, man! Don't let 'em hear you say that, buddy. He's something else, this kid. Go ahead, go tell the cops. Go ahead, go tell 'em. He's a fucking soldier, I swear. - 18 years, the same job. - 18 years? Riding the iron horse of work every day. I spent 18 years in the joint. - I got no choice, cuzzie. - I held the same job you did. - I got family to raise, bro. - I had 18 years in the joint. You had a better life than me, dude. Oh man. Yo, Leo. - What was my name? - Cheers. - What was my name again? - Nice seeing you. What was my name again? - Cheers. - Cheers. Leo. - Cheers, what? - Leo? Leo, right. Nice seeing you, cuzzie. Don't blame him, he doesn't even know his own name. Next time you call me Leo, you're going through that fucking window. Hey. Leon, what's up? What's up, man? - How you been? - I'm all right, you? - How's everything? - Good, man. - Yeah. - Yeah. What's going on? You want a drink? I'm drinking already. - What's happening, Koja? - What's up, Viktor? How you been, man? Good. How's your family? - Brothers good? - Everybody good. I heard your father died, huh. - Yeah. - Sorry to hear that. I appreciate that, thank you. Get these guys a drink. Don't worry about it, I got this, it's fine. Alright. Take care. See you again. Yo, Vinny. Vinny. Shut up and listen to me, man. You don't know who that motherfucker is? No, but he got a big ass fucking mouth. Yo relax, don't fucking say nothing to him. Don't look at him, nothing. He's a fucking federal informant. You and Koja go in there, just chill the fuck out. Relax. I'm gonna call Bear right now. You keep an eye on him. - Tell me if he leaves. - He ain't going nowhere. All right. Yo, don't do anything, - alright? - I got you. Call Bear. - Yo. - What's up big bro? What's going on? You won't believe who I just fucking saw right now. Who? Who I ran into in the fucking bar, hanging out drinking with the boys. Who the fuck you run into, bro? You remember Viktor the fucking rat? After how many years, the motherfucker just... What the fuck is he doing here, bro? I don't know. All that time I spent in the joint, huh? When he saw me, he was all dressed like a pimp. I'm gonna go right now... Calm down. Here, take a blast, take a fucking blast. Fuck, motherfucker, man! Calm down, bro, give it a second. He dies before I fucking die, that's all I'm saying. Leon, you gotta calm down first, bro. - Let's go back over there. - We can't, no, no, no. Let's go back over there. I want to go right now and kill this motherfucker. Let's just go over there. Fuck June and everyone. No, we're not going over there right now, bro. Slow down a second first, bro. We gotta do this... - Think about this, bro. - Gimme some shit. We cannot just go in there and do what you wanna do. I know what you wanna do, but we can't do it like that, bro. There's fucking cameras on every fucking corner, bro. Just pass that. Can't even find my fucking nose. Lemme calm down a little too right now, 'cause you got me fuckin'... How the fuck does he got balls to show up now? We gonna go pick up June. We gonna sit down have drink, we gonna talk about this. He got balls to touch me, bro. There's no snitching. If you see that person anywhere on the street, and you don't do what you're supposed to do, you're not a man anymore. No matter how you do it. If you choke him to death, or whatever it is. But if you see him on the street, you have to do it. If you're a man, you're a man. There's no, "Oh, I'm a half a man, or I'm 75% man." No. If you're a man, then you're a fucking man, and that's it. You fuck with our code, you fuck with everything. Our pride, our last name. Everything that we did for thousands of years. Everything goes to shit. If you don't do what you're supposed to do. Gimme the gun. No, bro, chill out, bro. - You're too fucked up, man. - Gimme the fucking gun, bro. Yo Leon man you're not in the right fucking state of mind. Who the fuck asked you anything? I'm telling you, you're not in the right fucking state of mind. You wanna get out? You're my boys. You guys are with me, right? Cuz, I'm with you, no matter what. Are you with me, you with me? But I'm not gonna roll - when you stupid. - I'm here for you. Gimme the fucking gun. Don't fucking give it to him, Bear. Relax with that shit, man! - Put it down, bro! - Back up! - Leon, calm down. - Shut up! - Bear... - Shut the fuck up! Bro, put it the fuck down, man. Shut up. Put the fucking thing down, bro. And you shut the fuck up too. Yo, keep that shit down bro, keep it down bro, yo. - Leon, keep it down, man. - Relax, bro, I got this. Why the fuck did you give him the fucking gun? I thought he woulda calmed down a little. Calm down? You just gave him a fucking gun. Just go. Bro, you with me or not? Think about what you're saying, bro. We're fucking with your head, alright? Think about what you're saying. Drive the car! - Put that thing down, bro. - Drive the fucking car! Put that fucking thing down, bro. - This is my beef. - Our beef too.

(upbeat sitar music) (Maria speaking foreign language) Hi Maria. Hi Koja. (both speaking foreign language) - You know Michelle? - Hi Michelle. This is Lisa. - Hi Lisa. - Hi, how're you doing? Maria, is Leon here? Leon's sleeping. Can I go downstairs and talk to him? I will go. Go and sit on the porch, and I will go and try to wake him up. Okay, go wake him up. (hip-hop music) Fuck, fucking motherfucker. Leon. Leon! Leon! - Hey Leon. - What? (Maria speaking foreign language) You got my fucking number. Why are you yelling? (Maria speaking foreign language) - Fuck. - You lowlife. Yeah. Alright. Call me. - What is that? - Oh, man. - Here, Koja. - You know what that is? That's Albanian moonshine. - Albanian moonshine. - Albanian moonshine. You gotta try it. - Thank you, Maria. - Koja? - Serve some. - Yeah, yeah, no, no, I got it, I got it. (Maria speaking foreign language) Yeah, thank you. (speaking foreign language) Do you take it as a shot? No, no, no you can't take it as a shot. Yo, it's rough. You gotta sip it. My uncle, from when he was 14, he smoked till he was 93. He died. Every single day of his life he smoked. How old was your grandfather? - 108 - 108 years old. - Yeah. - He smoked his whole life. I know, he was very old. From five in the morning, he walked to church every day, - until it closed. - Wow. That sounds like my grandfather. What's going on? - What's up, bro? - What's up, man? - You alright? - Sleeping? Yeah, something like that. - I came up here to see you... - That's it? - That's it? - You want some? No, no, I'm good, thank you. She swears I'm an alcoholic. Look how she pours mine, and look how she pours everyone else. Yours is more full. Listen, I've got more than you do. - You alright? - No. I know. (Giggling) I know. I know, that's why I came up here. I'm having a rough time with all this shit. I know, you're bugging out, man. - I don't know. - You don't know? - You have a boy, you have one? - I'm gonna wait. I'm gonna wait. Can I talk to you for a second? Can you go make me a coffee, coffee. Coffee, thank you, coffee. Thank you, I love you. Why did we come over here again? (traffic drowns out voice) Alright, just have a drink, we're leaving. - What the fuck is this? - Hey you want us to take off? No, man, you're always welcome at my house. I just didn't know you guys were coming. I had a rough night. - Yeah, what happened? - I'm sweating like a dog. Ah, something happened. - Drank too much last night. - Is that surprising? I'll be right back. - Now? - Yeah. Ladies, excuse me for one second, I'll be right back. - So? - Fortune. We're gonna look... This is different from that. That means a lot of money, you see. - For me? - Yeah. - A lot of money. - Yeah. Oh, that's so beautiful, my God. What does it say, Maria? It's really beautiful. A lot of beautiful trips, happiness, money. Children maybe? - Two. - Two children? Look, look. Looks like not far apart from each other, look. - I see. - You see those two? Looks such a beautiful thing. Very, very good luck. Whatchamacallit in English, I wish I knew better to explain it to you. I'm serious. A lot of prosperity. Yeah? Everything looks such a beautiful. I swear on the Holy Bible, I'm serious. When we left the country, that was 1975. And me and my husband and my three children, and my mother-in-law, she was old lady. We left the house because we were afraid they were gonna put us in jail because it was Communism time. We went through snow, and barefoot. I walked five hours barefoot with my kid on my back. Jesus. That's... I wish I know how to express even more correctly, you know? Then, when we came to United States, we arrived here, we start to work a little bit, you know. When you come over here, no language, no help, no nothing. Four years after, my husband got sick of cancer, and he passed away, 42 years old. But finally God helped us, and we did, we did, you know, pretty good. Leon, he's um, he's a person... He's a type of person - very active. - Mm-hmm. Very active. But he's very good person in his heart. And um... But that doesn't explain what's... You really should get married to Leon. (Lisa chuckling) You will be, I would be very happy. Very happy. I would be very happy - for Leon. - I'm sure you would be, yeah. Because you're a sweetheart. Marko. Koja, what's up, cuz? - How're you doing, my friend? - Good. How's everything? Good, everything is good, - thank God. - Yeah, long time no see, man. - What are we gonna do. - What've you been up to? Not much, playing with this car a little bit, trying to put her together, - a couple of little things. - Ah, she's a beauty. - So how you been, good? - Good, good, I swear. How's your family, how's your son? - He's in college, right? - Yes. He's doing alright? - He's doing okay. - How's he in school? He's doing good in school? Everybody's good. Otherwise, you'd kick his ass, right? - That's it. - What about your daughter? - How's she doing? - She's alright. Relax, she's okay. - Alright. - How you been? I been alright, running up and down. Trying to make a dollar here, make a dollar there. Trying to get to your level. You will get there one day. Just gotta stay in line. If I can make as long as you, I'll be okay. Right. Go in the car, I wanna show you something. Let's hear this bitch roar. This thing is old, but it starts like new. Sometimes. (engine turns over) That's a lot of power right there. Oh you can feel that power. (engine revving) Whoo, hoo, hoo! Yeah, she's a fucking beast. She's a fucking beast, man. (engine revving) You know why I called you here, right? No I don't. I was wondering myself why you called me. I called you about Leon. Listen to me. You don't understand what happened with this guy. What happened with this guy, we are exposed! (speaks in foreign language) Do you understand what I'm saying? Marko, I understand. Listen to me, listen to me, okay... We gonna have feds on our ass. I understand what you're saying. He's seen the fucking rat. What do you want him to do, Marko? What do you want him to do? Nobody's gonna stop him, not you... I am telling you, you shut him off, - or I will shut him off. - What are you gonna do? You gonna take the guineas' side? - For money? - All the Bronx... Why, because you're losing some fucking money? - Knows about our shit! - So what? I don't wanna fucking talk about this shit no more! (speaking foreign language) Get out! Marko, lemme tell you something... - It's over! - Okay, no problem. Before I leave, before I leave, I wanna tell you one thing... Go! Yeah? - Okay, motherfucker, okay. - Go! And you don't call me motherfucker. (speaking foreign language) - Goodbye. - Okay, okay, Marko. I'm not gonna hear this shit anymore. - Okay. - Fucking scarlata! (speaking foreign language) Fucking scumbags! Hold on a second. Hold on a minute. What's wrong? I'm sorry. What do you mean, "What's wrong?" You caught me off guard today. - What's happening? - I don't know. You guys just showed up unexpectedly, and I just had woken up. I was really happy to see you there. You don't know what I'm going through. So tell me. - I can't tell you this shit. - Why not? 'Cause it's not for you to know stuff like this. You're the only good thing that I look forward to in this life right now. Can I make it up to you? You know, I've been through this before, Leon. I don't think... Don't do this shit. I can't... I hope you know, I got feelings... I do, I get it. You don't know how I feel about you? Isn't it obvious? (chuckles) Yeah. I get it, I really do. Just... (gentle music) Motherfucker. You gotta know Leon earlier. Back, you know, we're talking about 10 years, 20 years ago. Man, he was a bad motherfucker, man. Nobody could even look that guy in the eye. And now he's... Since I've known Leon, all right, he's the one that flies off the handle right away. He has a short fuse. Right away, something sets him off. And I'm always the one, I'm a little more, you know, listen. I'm the one who's more cool, calm, collected, you know what I mean, I think about things. I think things through. I don't think about what's in front of me one step ahead. I think about three steps ahead. And... I don't know the word to use for it. I'm starting to feel really angry, and really... I'm starting to be a little disappointed with Leon. That's what it is, and that's making me angry. 'Cause I wish he was smarter. (hip-hop music) Where's my money? Where's my fucking money? You fucking mutt. You fucking piece of shit motherfucker. Huh? How 'bout now? Do your whole fucking family a favor, you fucking piece of shit motherfucker. Fuck you motherfucker. Garbage, garbage, motherfucker. Goodbye. Piece of shit motherfucker. I just don't know what to do. I don't know how to help him. I don't know how to help him. Listen, anything you do in this life, there's a consequence. Every action has a reaction. You can't go out do crazy shit and not expect something else to happen. Okay, you might think at the time you're bulletproof and everything. I could do this to that one, I could beat this one up, I could do this, or I could fuck someone's wife. All right, but listen, somethings gonna happen. That's how the world works. You fucking bitch ass nigga. - Where's that rat motherfucker? - Leon, go relax. You got that? Viktor's your boy, right? Leon, you're my boy, - what are you talking about? - Yeah, I'm your fucking boy? I fucking did so much shit for all you motherfuckers. Somebody gotta know where the fuck he is. I don't know. Somebody here gotta know where the fuck he is. If I knew, I would tell you guys. None of you guys remember me? Get the fuck outta here. I fucking did shit for every fucking one of you. If I see him, I woulda let you know. I didn't see nothing! Somebody knows where that rat is! Somebody knows where that rat is! I've known you my whole life, I don't know where he is. If I knew where he is, I would fucking tell you. - Listen, Leon, Leon, Leon. - Talk to me. Listen, I know you want to catch this motherfucker. But we gotta do it smart. Take it easy, just take a seat. Relax, man. Listen, do things the right way. (Leon speaks in foreign language) Yeah we are. - Yeah we are. - Fuck that motherfucker. Yeah we are. That motherfucker got the balls to touch me after what happened? Yeah, but how 'bout we do it without... You understand, without you getting... - You understand? - Yeah, alright. Yeah, whatever, don't worry. We'll see what happens. Who are these people in here? Who the fuck are the rest of these... - I'm not fucking alright. - I know you're not alright. I'm not alright either. - Ah alright. - We'll get him, bro. Alright, so? So what the fuck, bro? This fucking rat motherfucker's walking around here after all the shit I've been through because of him. Yo, yo, yo, shh. Come on, there are people in here. There are people in here, man. Man, fuck everybody in here. What happens if he ends up dead? What happens if he ends up dead? You wanna go to jail for the rest of your fucking life? Yes, yes! - Right now I don't give a fuck! - I know you would. - That's why I'm here. - What are we doing here? He's somewhere out here hanging out. I don't need you motherfuckers anyway. - Yo. - What's up, man? Sit down one second, I gotta talk to you. Lemme ask you a question. Somebody else in here's catching it if I don't get the fuck outta here right now. - Hey, hey, hey. - Come on, man! Leon, look at me, lemme ask you a question. Yo, talk to me. - That's all I hear is talk. - Yo, Vinny, is he solid? Yeah, Vinny's solid. Why do you think I keep him around me? - You sure about that? - Solid as a fucking rock. He's not Albanian, my friend. I don't give a fuck if he's Albanian or not. I babysat that kid when he was a kid. - Oh yeah? - Yeah. People could talk all they want. All right, talk means nothing. You have to prove your fucking loyalty. You have to prove your fucking respect. I've been around enough people to know. That's not what loyalty is, Leon. That's not what loyalty is. If he's not afraid of death, then he's not afraid of life. That's what I see in him. People don't realize this. You think, with all your heart, you think that he would take a bullet for you without thinking about it in the blink of an eye? Do you really, really believe that? ♪ He's winking if I now saw his friend ♪ You're mine, right, you're with me, right? - Yeah. - You with me, right? Yeah. Listen to me, what I wanna do, what I want, what I wanna do, is that what you wanna do? I shoulda done it that night. Listen to me. - This is our mission. - What's going on here?

Yeah, so you were talking to him! - I known you my whole life! - So what's up? - What's up, man? - I know you my whole life! Yeah, what's up man? And you were hanging out with him? Nah I don't hang out with him, dude. I saw you hanging out with him! - Where's Viktor? - I used to hang out with him, you used to hang out with him too, homeboy! You know what he did to me.

If you see him, what're you gonna do? - You gonna call me right away? - I'll call you. You gonna call me right away? I will call you right away. Don't make me come back here, man. - Yeah I know. - Alright? All right, no problem, man. (hip-hop music) Okay, if you're fucking lying. If I found out you're fucking lying, I'm gonna fucking bury you just like that fucking rat. You understand me? Huh? Leon, no Leon, don't do it! (gun fires) Leon, what the fuck are you doing, man? They got me in there on fucking camera! - Get the fuck in the car! - Come on, motherfucker. (hip-hop music) Fucking Leon, huh? I know. Don't worry, we'll take care of our boy. - Of course we will. - I love you bro. I love you too, my boy. - You know that. - You're the man. We better take care of him. You know you're my brother. - You're my brother too. - He's our brother too. That's why I'm here for him. Leon's the type of guy, he needs that rush, that adrenaline. He can't work a regular job, Leon. No, he'll never work a regular job. No way. Number one, he can't work for anybody. No, no, he'll never work, period. He can't work for anybody, okay? - He'll never work. - Forget about that. But he's not for work. He's a hustler. He hustles. He likes to go out drinking. He was always like that. But recently... He was never careless. He started hanging out with these new people, like Vinny. Hanging out with these new people, like who the fuck are these people? Who the fuck are these people, man? I don't know who the fuck these people are. Why, because they're there... I just show him respect 'cause that's Leon's boy... 'Cause they're good drinking buddies, now it's your fucking best friend in the whole world? Yeah, I guess so. That's what happens, overnight. 'Cause that's your drinking buddy? What the fuck is up, dude? Leon's alright bro back there? Yeah, he's good, bro. We're all here for you, brother. - You gotta know that. - Man, fuck you. You gotta know that, bro. Where's my friends?

I know you wanted the motherfucker, and we let him slip through our fucking hands, man. - I'm sorry. - Shut the fuck up, bro. All right, don't bug out, don't bug out. This is what I gotta go through? This is what my life has turned out to be? Fucking motherfucker! Let this motherfucker... Leon, Leon. Fuck you! There's the right way to do things. The smart way to do things... Please, bro. If something needed to be taken care of, it woulda been taken care of. I don't care about no cameras... Vinny, Vinny, Vinny, take it easy, Vinny. You're the one that ruined that night. Fuck outta here. You niggas are treating me like a fucking stepchild. Why, 'cause I'm Italian? You motherfuckers ordered the guy a drink. Yo Koja, I don't even know how this kid came in here bro... What the fuck is that? My man I told you, you ruined everything. You ruined it. If that job was supposed to get done, what are you stopping me for? - I woulda ended it right there. - It's not your place. Leon wanted to do it, not us. That rat ain't supposed to fucking even be near us! Buy him a drink! Keep him there! What the fuck is wrong with you! It's about family, it's about honor, respect. You have no fucking clue about that... - 'Fuck outta here. - Leon, calm your boy down. You shoulda been a fucking author. Leon, calm your fucking boy down, cuz. With your stories, bro.

You're fucking lucky. 'Cause me, I don't fucking, you're not Albanian, I don't fucking trust you. I don't like you, I don't fucking trust you. You don't gotta like me, dude. I don't run around with you, I run around for him. How you let that rat go? - How you let that rat go? - I didn't let him go. Yeah, you let him go. Nigga, he was paying his bill.

Your parents taught you to be tough. Like my father told me, "don't you ever come, if you lose a fight, "don't you dare fucking come home.
