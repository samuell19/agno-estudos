Heaven knows he doesn'’t often get a chance to get away from the ranch on an outing. Besides, he may have a surprise for you. Come on. Are you gonna wait all day? Did you bring the blanket? Oh, I-- I'’ll get it. Oh, thank you. [ suspenseful theme playing] Stay where you are, my friend. Have a nice day.Thank you. BANKER: Sheriff! Sheriff! Sheriff! El Pescadore! MAN 1: Hey, what'’s all the shooting about? MAN 2: What happened? Who'’s been shot? MAN 3: Can you get the doctor? The banker has been shot. He'’ll need Hoskins. SANTEE: Sure that was El Pescadore? It'’s a long ways from the border. Sure, I'’m sure. Didn'’t he have his gun stuck right in my face? And how about those black spurs? BANKER: Oh, they won'’t get them. They never do. Notify Wells Fargo. I'’m doubling the reward on El Pescadore. He'’s at a fifteen-hundred-dollar alive, it'’s now three thousand. How does that deal sound to you, Santee? That ought to be pretty good. You'’re the fastest gun around. Let'’s get away from here. You haven'’t forgotten our picnic? [ suspenseful theme playing] [ upbeat theme playing] It'’s beautiful. That'’s the way it was meant to be. All, a man and a woman, nature, picnic basket full of good food. I don'’t see enough of you. Give me a hand with this. Maybe when they make you foreman of the ranch. Oh, I'’m tired of working for other people. Everybody works for somebody. You don'’t. You have your own store. I want to own something. You will someday. Aw, someday. When is someday? I was thinking of El Pescadore. I'’ve always known the way you keep practicing that draw of yours. Someday you'’d have to see if it'’s really as fast as everybody says. Well, why not? Become a bounty hunter? But Anna, it'’s $3,000. That kind of easy money never did anybody any good. [ romantic theme playing] Mrs. Rourke said that, ah, you might have a surprise for me. [ chuckles ] Oh, she did, did she? I do have. ANNA: Aah. It'’s lovely. [ suspenseful theme playing] SANTEE: When a man robs your bank and kills a man you'’ve known for a long time, it isn'’t hard to make up your mind to go after him. Especially if there'’s a $3,000 reward. It isn'’t hard to kill a man if he draws against you. [ slow theme playing] [ children chattering indistinctly ] [ horse neighing ] Hola. Hola. Ha-ha-ha. Aah. [ Speaking in Spanish] Ha-ha-ha. Ha! [ Speaks Spanish ] [ chuckles ] El Pescadore? Sí,gringo. El Pescadore. I'’ve been tracking you for ten months. What a waste of time. You have gone to a lot of trouble to die, amigo. [ chuckles ] [ suspenseful theme playing] [ men speaking indistinctly ] [ suspenseful theme playing] SANTEE: Mrs. Rourke. My, you'’ve been missing for quite a spell. Anna here? No, she'’s gone. Gone? Where? She got married, turned the store over to me. Married? Anna? To a man named Ralph Elkins. He used to be the sheriff of Laredo. Good, God-fearing, law-abiding man. But why? Maybe it'’s the reputation you'’ve been making for yourself. [ melancholic theme playing] SANTEE: You'’ve made the easy money once, soon you'’re after more of it. You'’re hunting the biggest game in the world. You'’re planning your moves all the time, but you'’re on the watch yourself. You sleep with one eye open. You'’re successful, and then before you know it, you'’re a bounty hunter. You'’ve crossed the line. There'’s no going back. [ clicking ] [ suspenseful theme playing] [ groans ] Well, I see you'’re back again. SANTEE: Yeah. Unh. It'’s been a year or two since you saw me last. MAN: How come you'’re bringing him in alive? I wanted somebody to talk to on the way in. Notify Wells Fargo I'’ll be after the reward on him. Sure thing, Santee. By the way, I got a new wanted poster in this morning. Fellow by the name of Ben Masters. Five hundred on his head. Ain'’t even put it up yet. I don'’t work that cheap. He can'’t be very far from here. It isn'’t worth it. [ slow theme playing] Hello, Santee. SANTEE: Sheriff. You gonna be in town long? I'’m looking for Kile. Seen him around? Yeah, he'’s right behind you. Huh. Santee.Hello, Kile. What brings you to me? Well, we'’ve got business. Where can we talk? Well, what'’s the matter with right here? Him we don'’t need. Sit down. Loosen up your money belt. [ chuckles ] Well, just get in from Texas? My being here worry you any? Hm. There'’s lots of people who do worry when you come around. Huh. Especially if they don'’t know why. Well, it'’s themselves they worry about mostly. Uh-- Understand you'’re number one now. What can I do for you? No, it'’s what I can do for you. Here'’s a map. And here'’s Wichita, and here'’s Lark. They'’re gonna lay track along here and make this a rail head town. I could just as easily come your way here to Kile. Hm. I fought every way I knew how to get that railroad franchise. Well, I can get it for you. It'’s impossible. They already made up their minds. It'’ll cost you 2,500 for me and 2,500 for the people I have to bring in. Go on. See, they have a hard and fast rule. They never lay track to a hell town. [ chuckles ] Lark ain'’t no hell town. Not by any means. Why, they'’ve got a sheriff there that keeps it slick and clean and law abiding. A gun, name of Ralph Elkins. Elkins? Yeah, he come there recently and settled, and cleaned the place up. Well, I'’ll dirty it again. You know, I own a quarter of a million acres in and around this town. Without the railroad, it'’s worth 10 cents an acre. With the railroad, it'’s worth 10 dollars an acre. Now, if you can swing that franchise for me, you got a deal. And there'’s one other thing. I want a bonus. Huh? Ten thousand acres bordering on Skeleton Creek. Hm. You'’re gonna be a rich man, Santee. Well, I'’ll get a drink and meet you at the bank. Mr. Kile. That'’s a great idea Santee has. You got big ears, ain'’t you? Yeah, but his price is a little high. Tell you what, I'’ll do it for a lot less. If Santee can do it, I can do it. Why, you couldn'’t even lick Santee'’s boots. Mr. Kile. Maybe I could be number one. All right, if you'’re fool enough, I'’ll give you $10,000. You'’re scheduled to be hung tomorrow anyway. So, what have you got to lose? You run out the door like it was a jailbreak, and if you take him, there'’ll be a couple horses waiting for you. MAN: What choice we got? Right. All right. We'’ll take a crack at Santee. Now, remember, if you run out that door without killing Santee, you'’re not gonna get very far because I'’m gonna be holding a shotgun on you. [ suspenseful theme playing] I never saw anything like that in my life before. Who were they? Prisoners, sentenced to hang. What was he doing? Well, I guess if they were trying to make a break, I-- I guess he was chasing '’em. You'’ll need a new sheriff. [ woman wailing ] Oh, no. [ sobbing ] That'’s his wife. That'’s him there, Greta. Santee himself. You killed my husband. You murderer, you! He had a gun in his hand. Shouldn'’t a lawman have a gun in his hands? Ooh! Now, listen. Take her home.Oh. Go ahead. Go on. [ wailing ] I'’m going over to the telegraph office. [ melancholic theme playing] [ suspenseful theme playing] Oh, Sandra dear, would you hook me, please? [ knocks on door ] WOMAN: Sadie. Well, Bill Henderson. Howdy. When did you and Swifty hit town? We just got in. Listen, Sadie. Santee wants to see you and the girls over in Kansas. Oh? What'’s it all about? What difference does it make? Honey, he'’s got a Christmas tree with nothing but money hanging off it. I'’m gonna bring my gambling tools. Ah. Mm, he'’s cute. Heh. So is the gun he usually wears. All right, ladies, let'’s go upstairs and get packed. We are going places. Wanna sit down, Bill? Come on in, Swifty. [ slow theme playing] [ whinnying ] [ horse neighing ] [ suspenseful theme playing] Get on now! Drop it. I said drop it! All right. Who are you? When a man tries to kill me, I wanna know why. It was the blacksmith in the town of Lark. He was at the telegraph office last night. Got word you were coming in and he gave me $500. Five hundred. Where is it? Give it to me. What, what, what are you--?Give me the 500. Now, take that jacket off. My jacket? Take it off. If I ever see your face again, you won'’t have any. Come on, give me the jacket. [ slow theme playing] [ door bells ringing ] Here it is. Santee shoots three men in Kile, Kansas. What'’s the matter? You'’ll need that for your front page too. Santee'’s coming here to Lark. Sheriff Elkins will take care of him. Maybe he'’s coming here for us. You mean you think maybe your husband'’s hired him? Well, he said he was going to kill us, didn'’t he? [ sighs ] Everyone around here thinks you'’re my husband. Even I think so. Oh, Sam, what are we going to do? Well, I'’ll tell you one thing. We'’re not going to run, Clare. Not anymore. [ slow theme playing] I wonder who he wants to kill here. Who could he be hunting for in a town like this? MAN: There ain'’t nobody in Lark with a bounty on his head. Maybe he'’s gone on to Wichita. Is that him? Yes, Manuel, that'’s him. Hey, Mr. Santee! Everyone, look, it'’s Santee! Hey, it'’s Santee! Everyone, look, it'’s Santee! Hey, it'’s Santee! Everyone, look! [ suspenseful theme playing] Pick that up. Save yourself some money. [ clanging ] Why'’d you pay to have me killed? You either tell me or I'’m gonna drown you. You come here to get me! Why? I don'’t even know you. You can'’t fool me. I still think you come here to get me. Santee. Yeah? I'’m Sheriff Elkins. You come well recommended. He should, Santee. He'’s a good man. What are you doing here in Lark? I'’ve got business. This is a nice clean town. We don'’t need you. Well, I'’ll keep the law, you keep your distance. I want you out of town. I'’ve decided to settle down here. You'’re not gonna settle here. Get out of town. It'’s not going to be that easy for you. This is Lark, Kansas, Santee, not Kile. You start anything in this town, people here will tear you apart. Might be the other way around. You see, Santee, I don'’t carry any guns. Now, you wouldn'’t wanna draw on an unarmed man, would you? Might reflect on that big reputation of yours. Now, if you take me, it'’ll have to be with your bare hands. I don'’t think I have to take you. Now, I heard him ask you to leave town. When I'’m through with you, you'’re going to. Well, I don'’t know what this is all about... Ralph, what are you going to do? I want Santee to get whipped. If I stay out here, I'’m gonna have to stop it. [ suspenseful theme playing] [ crowd shouting indistinctly ] MAN 1: Get him. Come on.MAN 2: Get him. [ crowd indistinctly shouting ] MAN 3: Tear him. MAN 4: Come on, get at him. MAN 5: Go on, get at him. [ crowd indistinctly speaking ] Hey. That was some fight, mister. Who is that?Him? That'’s our preacher. Preacher? Yeah. That'’s his way of wrestling the devil. [ knocking on door ] [ slow theme playing] Anna. How did you find me? Who was looking? You were. Why? Just because you left me high and dry? You left me. Standing in front of the millenary shop with a dumb look on my face? You never came back. Oh, I came back all right. What you mean is that you forgot to wait. What is it you wanted? A first-hand look at my husband? Santee, Ralph'’s a good man. What'’s good supposed to mean? You say the word good, it'’s like it was something obscene. Maybe the way you are these days it is. Wherever you go, there'’s death and violence. Please, don'’t bring it to Lark. The people here have dreams. Well, I had a dream once, and I had a diamond ring to prove it. Am I the reason you came back? It'’s business. A cold-turkey proposition. I'’m working. I promised my husband I'’d ask you. [ chuckles ] Anna, I was ambushed on the way into town, I was beaten half to death when I got here, and now that it'’s getting interesting, you want me to just ride away? Then I don'’t suppose that I can persuade you to go, to just ride away. Well, it was nice seeing you again, Anna. Oh, uh, don'’t ever think I forgot you because I didn'’t. Santee...

Senor! My name is Manuel Ruiz. Hello, Manuel. Could I ask you something? Sure, go ahead, son. Are you a bad man? I might be. Did you come from a bad place? Well, a lot of people think any place I go is a bad place. They might be right.I like you. Well, nobody likes a bad man, Manuel. Would you like me to sing a song for you? Oh, I'’m sorry, I don'’t have time for any songs. It'’s sad to be a bad man. Yeah. SANTEE: You really pack a wallop. If I'’d have known you were a man of God, I wouldn'’t have fought with you. You wouldn'’t? I doubt it. What are you doing here? An honest day'’s work. You ought to try it sometime. Where'’d a preacher like you ever learn to fight like that? I wasn'’t always a preacher. As a matter of fact, a group of men once got so mad at me, they put a rope around my neck. But fortunately, at the last moment, the good Lord stepped in and saved me. Here. I'’ll show you. You can still see the rope burn. What are you hiding it for? Ashamed of it? Now that you bring it up, no, I'’m not. Not at all. Whiskey. I'’m looking for the owner of this place. I'’m the owner. Well. I'’m in a little better shape than the last time you saw me. [ chuckles ] Munchen'’s the name. Pete Munchen. Drinks are on the house. Well, that'’s the first friendly thing I'’ve heard since I'’ve been in town. I understand you'’re going to be around town for a while. Well, if everybody'’s as friendly as you are. Mr. Santee, uh-- Now you don'’t sound so friendly. Do you know who I am or anything about me? Didn'’t even know your name. I thought maybe some people back in St. Louis might have sent you after me. Who'’d you murder? Oh, nothing like that. Then your being in town has nothing to do with me? Oh, you'’re wrong. It does. I'’m your new partner. Hm. I don'’t have partners. I'’m gonna open up gambling. The equipment'’s already on its way. I used to have real gambling here, but the sheriff bulldozed me out of it, and he still sticks to it. The sheriff will be my problem. What makes you think I'’d take you in as a partner? I had a feeling. Well, I suppose with a little gambling, we could get those drovers back in town. It'’s already been arranged. And the girls too. Little beauties from New Orleans. Just like old times. Mr. Santee, you have yourself a deal. Never call your partner "mister." It doesn'’t sound friendly. The drinks are on the-- On us. Giddyup, hyah! Well, are you proud, Santee? You scared the blacksmith clear out of town, now didn'’t you? That'’s his problem. You got other people here just worried sick about you. They probably have a guilty past. Reverend, you certainly have a fine congregation. Now listen, Santee. You wear those fancy black spurs of yours just like cloven hooves. But other men, who are not animals, have to live with their conscience. Sometimes in fear of their conscience. Why don'’t you leave Lark? Leave these people alone. Well, people seem to think that his coming here makes it their judgment day. Maybe that'’s just what it is. Maybe. [ slow theme playing] [ cattlemen shouting indistinctly and cows mooing ] Why, Lark'’s about 20 miles out of your way, but maybe this will make the detour worth your while. Divide it up any way you like. I want the whole country to know that Lark is wide open and raring to go. Let your boys blow off a little steam. They got plenty of girls there too.

Oh, you no-good, footloose son of a gun. When you call me "footloose," smile. I am smiling, sweetie. SADIE: Come on, girls. Come on.Yes. SADIE: Hello, gentlemen. Where'’s Ralph? He had to go out to Stone Junction on business. When'’s he coming back?Tonight. Maybe not till tomorrow. Oh. Santee sent for these women. Ralph'’s not going to stand for it. We don'’t have a law against saloon women. Santee may be after this whole town. I'’m going to ask him. No. Let me. Anna. SADIE: Come on. Hi, gentlemen. [ women and men laughing ] Listen, you can'’t go over there among that riffraff. I used to know Santee. [ laughing and indistinct chattering ] My. My, you'’re cute. But, Santee, I mean, this stinking little town. How am I supposed to make a living here? Well, you get $500 a week and all you can make on the side. Hm. That is more like it. [ laughs ] HENDERSON: Santee. Somebody to see you out back. Thanks. Oh, ha, ha. Competition? Nothing you can'’t handle, Sadie. Come, ladies. [ men laughing ] [ slow theme playing] First time I ever knew you to use a back door. Santee, why are those women here? Liven this town up. Gonna have gambling too. I'’m a partner in this place. Why are you doing this? I like money. You know my husband has to enforce law and order here. This'’ll make for drunks, shootings. Anna, this town has a big future. He won'’t stand by while you ruin it. Well, all right then, he can arrest all the drunks and hang all the killers. Just as long as he stays on his side of the street. But he won'’t. That'’s right. I forgot. He'’s a good man with a reputation of his own at stake. What do you want? Revenge? Tell me something, Anna. Did you go directly from me to him or were there others in between? [ slow theme playing] SWIFTY: There you go. There you go. Whoa. Whoa. You go in there and you tell old Santee that Swifty'’s here with his tools. [ piano playing Western music ] Well, evening, Clare. Reverend. Sam. Evening, reverend. [ men cheering ] Well, lookie who'’s got here. Bill Henderson. Hi, Sal. Hi. Say, honey. You'’re cute.I know. Well, come on. Uh, reverend, there'’s, uh, something Clare and I have to talk to you about.Oh? Well, ahem... SWIFTY: Away, she goes.Hi, Swifty. See they already got you in business. Yeah. Did you bring anybody else with money? Ha, ha. They'’ll deal. Hey. Santee. Well, now we'’ve got the two best gun fighters this side of the Mississippi. Ah, Henderson, Pete Munchen. Hi, Henderson. What about the drovers? They'’re hot on our heels. Looks like we'’re in business. What, uh-- What do we do? Well, Swifty runs the wheel, Pete runs the roulette, another runs the faro, and the rest of you play the house side, the poker tables and the bar. Keep the drinks coming hot and heavy. Well, that leaves me. You'’re the bouncer. And I bounce people pretty good. I know. What do I do? Oh, honey, you, uh... You just look cute. You don'’t have to tell us. We know what to do. I don'’t know, Sam. The blacksmith sure left town in a hurry. What was he afraid of? Probably a shadow in his past. You mean like Sam and me? No, Clare, I-- I don'’t think Santee was sent here by your husband. And I'’m still glad we told you the truth about us. I'’ll file intention for divorce in our hometown paper. SAM: Even if her husband sees it, he won'’t know where we are. And then Sam and I can get married. Odd. And evil visits upon us and causes people to purge the evil from within themselves. You know, a lot of other people thought that Santee was after them. But then the devil is always after everybody now, isn'’t he? Let'’s go in. [ gunshots ] [ cowboys cheering ] Welcome to Lark.

He hasn'’t come home and he'’s not at the office. Well, what'’s that got to do with me? Something must have happened to him. Every time somebody in this town catches a cold, I get blamed for it.

You take your orders from me.Well, sure. You said I was the town bouncer and he needed bouncing. Not that way. Well, I'’ll admit, I did consider shooting him. It'’d been better off if you had. Aw, let'’s look at it this way. now they ain'’t no law in this town at all. [ slow theme playing] I didn'’t send for you. Well, I brought the papers down on our deal.

Tell me what? He'’s your son. Yours and mine. I was pregnant, and those people in that little Texas town didn'’t want to buy their millinery from a woman they branded a scarlet. Then I got real lucky. I met a wonderful man. We were married two months before Chad was born. I didn'’t know. It wouldn'’t have made any difference. It might have. I didn'’t want you to know. He thinks that Ralph is his father, and I don'’t want him to ever know any difference. Anything I can do? Get out of our lives. Well, that might not be so easy. That'’s the trouble with you. You want everything the easy way. [ slow theme playing] There you are, Chad. Can I put you on your pony? Yeah. My daddy is hurt. I know he is. Will you play with me? I can'’t, Chad. I have to go now. My daddy is hurt. He can'’t play with me. I'’m sorry. What were you doing in there? Now, just take it easy, reverend. "Take it easy"? Gus Kile is in town and now it all makes sense.

Just calm downNow, listen, Santee, maybe we can'’t stop you from doing that, but God can. Have you ever heard the voice of an angry and righteous God, Santee? Have you? What would you do if you heard that, Santee? Shoot bullets at the sky? I don'’t know what you'’re talking about. Well, you will. Senor? What is it, Manuel? I do not want to be bad. I do not want to be like you. I told you nobody wants to be like me. [ tolling ] [ indistinct chattering ] This ain'’t Sunday. What'’s that church bell ringing for? I don'’t know. Maybe they'’re calling in the cows. [ piano playing Western music ] Why are the church bells ringing? Maybe Tanner'’s asking for help the only way he knows how. Calm down a little, will you? SWIFTY: Come on, boys. Take your bets down. Black or red. Red or black. [ bell continues tolling ] It'’s funny sound, isn'’t it? What'’s the matter, Sadie? Never hear church bells before? SWIFTY: Red or black. Odd or even. Kile. Yeah. Here'’s our contract. It'’s cancelled. What are you talking about? It won'’t work. Hm. Already is working. Well, I'’m calling it off. What'’s going on? Here'’s what I promised you. Sadie, this is for you and the girls. And the rest is yours. Don'’t you think you owe me an explanation? Yeah. I changed my mind. SWIFTY: Step right up, folks. Anybody can play. Anybody can win. Red or black. Odd or even. Come on, boys. Get your bets down. [ bell continues tolling ] Santee wants to quit, but I don'’t. I'’ve got too much at stake. Looks like he wants us to stay. There'’s $15,000 there. You keep running this town the way it'’s going, you can divide that up between you and your boys, Sadie and her girls and, uh, you too, Pete. In just one week. You just got yourself a deal. Didn'’t know you were that tall. Well, Sadie? I always go where the money is. Now we understand each other. I want you to keep this town roaring. And stop that church bell from ringing. It gets on my nerves. I'’m going home now. Oh. Why don'’t you stay for the fun? No. Uh, uh, town this noisy, I might not get no sleep. And, Pete, put that in the safe. [ bell continues tolling ] [ coughs ] [ chuckles ] [ coughs ] [ indistinct chattering ] [ woman screaming and indistinct chattering ] [ piano playing Western music and indistinct chattering ] SADIE: Hi. Howdy, friend. If you'’ve changed your mind, we could split up that money that Kile left. I haven'’t changed my mind. Neither has Kile. [ gun cocks ] [ gun cocks ] [ gun cocks ] They broke his arm to keep him from ringing the bell. Give me his badge. What for? I'’ve got a town to clean up. The badge, Anna. [ men indistinctly chattering ] Henderson! Henderson! Henderson! [ indistinct chattering ] It'’s him. He'’s back. And he'’s wearing a badge. He'’s a fool. SANTEE: I wanna see you out here, Henderson. Henderson! SADIE: Well, uh, come on, ladies. This is no place for us. Let'’s go. Oh, and you drovers, if you know what'’s good for you, you'’ll, uh, get back to the herd. Come, ladies. Henderson! Can you hear me? This is the law talking. I ain'’t coming out, Santee. Pete. Now, look, I can'’t take Santee, and I ain'’t even gonna try. But the four of us together, that'’s different. And there'’s $15,000 in it. Are you with me?Can'’t live forever. SANTEE: Henderson! I ain'’t comin'’ out, Santee! If you want me, you'’d better come in here and get me! Now, Swifty, you and Miller, go out the back. You go that way and you go the other. Pete, you go upstairs. [ suspenseful theme playing] SANTEE: Henderson! HENDERSON: I ain'’t coming out, Santee! SANTEE: Henderson! I wanna see you out here, Henderson. I ain'’t no match for you in a shootout, Santee. So why don'’t we, uh, talk this thing over? Do your talking out here. [ gunshot ] You can'’t shoot with that on arm. Anna, stay inside. [ gunshot ] [ gunshot ] Around the back. All right, Santee. You come on out! [ gunshots ] [ gunshot ] All right. Let'’s finish this thing right now. [ Swifty screams ] That was Ralph.Ralph? But he can'’t. How could he? I know. But he did. Alley! Alley! [ Henderson screaming ] My son thinks Santee is quite a man. I'’d, uh... I'’d like to help out with the support. I'’ll send some money. No. No, I don'’t want him to ever know. He'’d never know. There'’d be questions. All right, then. At least let me, uh, send him something like gifts at Christmastime or on his birthday. From Uncle Santee. I guess there'’d be no harm in that. Thanks. [ women giggling ] If you say he'’s cute, you'’re fired. COACHMAN: Hyah, hyah. Hyah! There you go. Hyah! [ men speaking indistinctly ] Well, maybe I'’ll see you again some time. Oh, uh, give this to Ralph. You wore it well. A rail-head town needs a good sheriff like him. TANNER: Santee. You know, I was sorry to see you come here, but-- Well, now I'’m sorry to see you leave. Thank you. Where are you going? Oh, I don'’t know. Maybe I'’ll become sheriff of somewhere. Bye. Goodbye, Santee. [ slow theme playing] Sheriff of somewhere. He could be, Anna.
