Edited and Resynced by H@w-to-kiLL. Hey, Jose. The way you drive around in this taco wagon, you'd think you'd want to be deported. Okay, culero. Yeah. Oh, here he comes now. Fashionably late, Earl. Helen, Helen, Helen. You look sensational. Sensational. Aw. You look pretty good yourself. It's been a long time. I brought you a little something from my latest cultivar. You charming old devil. This is lovely. Yes, I'll sign in right here. Hi. - Okay. - So talented. Tim Kennedy. My God. As I live and breathe. I thought you were dead. No such luck, I guess. Let me tell you something. Did anyone ever tell you you're a bit of an asshole, Earl? - All the time. - All the time. - Even in Spanish. - Yeah, okay. Oh, ladies. You're on the wrong floor. Third floor is the beauty pageant. Oh, Earl. It's literally so easy. My niece set this up for me. You just click one button and you can buy whatever you want. With one click from home, you get a choice of everything on our line. All the information is sent and the flowers arrive to you just two days later. The first person to sign up gets a 20% discount off their first order. Internet. Who needs it? There you go. - Hi, Earl. They're beautiful. - All right. Here, you get some. And here, you take these. Thanks, Earl. Oh, you're most welcome. You're most welcome. You're most welcome. Yes, ma'am. Here's some. And for you. Yeah, you're most welcome. - Earl! - Yeah, yeah, yeah. You'd think I'm giving away free Viagra or something. What's going on here? - Thanks, Earl. - I'll take one, Earl! I'll take one, too. I just... A wonderful thing you're doing here today. Earl, is that Jimmy Stewart? And now, the moment we've all been waiting for. The NDL 2005 Gold Medal winner is Earl Stone, with his Sunnyside Meadows' Illinois Majestic daylily. Earl! - Congratulations again, Earl. - Thank you. No booing, no booing. Thank you very much. And rather than give a long, boring speech, I just wanted to tell you a little joke. And that's... Why did the horticulturist walk across the hotel lobby? Why? 'Cause he wanted to get to the bar, and that's exactly where I'm headed. Thank you! Where is he? He'll be here, right? Don't hold your breath, honey. Grandpa Earl will be here. He promised. Oh, my poor girls. There's no sign of him. Well, he'll be here. It's my wedding day. I love you, Iris, I do. But you have to face facts. Your father has always chose work over family. He missed your baptism, your confirmation, your graduation. Countless birthdays. Not to mention most of our anniversaries. I think I'm going to be sick. Who's gonna give Mommy away? Oh, well... - Oh, honey, my sweet Ginny. - Iris. Hon. Can we have another little reload here? Another Crown Royal, Earl? Yeah. In fact, get the whole bar one. Them, too? The wedding party? Them, too. All right. A round for everybody on Earl! I'll drink to that. Okay. Here you go, amigos. Sorry it couldn't be more. Damn Internet, it ruins everything. So what are you gonna do? I don't know. I've never been a plan-B type of guy. - Gracias, amigo. - My pleasure. Thank you. I'll find something. Gracias. Grandpa Earl! You're here! Yeah. Hey, Ginny. You look wonderful. I knew you'd make it to the pre-wedding brunch. Oh, I'm so excited. Is everything okay? Yeah, don't worry about that. That's just a minor setback. - It'll be just fine. - Okay. Well, come on in. I don't care what they say. You're always welcome. Come on. Okay. All right, you first. I just gotta grab something inside, then I'll introduce you to everybody. Ooh. Oh, my God. You saved all my cards. Ever since the first one you sent me, when I was nine. It was the Corn Palace? Um... Okay. I want you to meet Mike. Okay? He's my fiance. Don't forget. Fiance. All right. Okay, fiance. You need help with that? It's fine. Thank you. - Mom. - Jesus. I'm sorry, sweetie. I can't stay if he's here. - I'll wait in the car, Mom. - No. Honey. Honey. Well, of course. You're not here because of the wedding. No, no. You're here because you had nowhere else to go. Again! And you promised Ginny you'd help pay for the wedding. It's fine, Grandma. We can just make it BYOB. No, it's not fine. It's never been fine. Why don't you knock it off? Man, he's in deep shit. Just stop it. Come back doing the same old shit all the time. How dare you come in here and make all this fuss right here in front of her. Because you weren't there for your own daughter, and now you're letting down your granddaughter? But it's no big surprise, you know why? Yeah, why? You were never a real father or a husband. I was on the road 60 hours a week to provide for this family. What the hell are you talking about? On the road providing? Ha! You know what you do? You play with your friends. You sit around and hand each other trophies - for watching seeds sprout. - Trophies? - Mr. Daylily. - You fucking... Ginny, come here, please. Oh, my God, I'm so sorry. It's okay, Grandma. Thank you. I'm so sorry, darling. They did the alterations. I'll see you next week, sweet girl. Thank you, Grandma. I'm sorry, darling. I'm sorry. I'll be going. Be right back. Bitch. Bitch. Hey, man. Weddings make everyone crazy. Always some kind of drama. Yeah. You got that right. Looks like you covered some ground in your day. Yeah. Forty-one states out of 50. Never had a ticket, nothing. Just drive. I never had a problem. This old truck is great. Got a good record. - No tickets? - Nah. Never had one. Ever in my life, I've never had one. My grandpa was a real road warrior, too. He loved to drive. Yeah. Well, let's hear it for gramps. I'm Richard. Rico. I'm a friend of one of Ginny's bridesmaids. Yeah, okay, Rico. My name's Earl. Hey, Earl, you know, if you're really stuck... I know some people who would pay you to just drive, one city to another. Pay me to just drive? What do you get out of it, slick? All I'm saying is, I have friends looking for cautious drivers like you. Yeah. You could help your granddaughter. All righty. Just drive. Okay. All right. It says "tire shop," but which one? Hola. I'm Earl. Hola, hola, Earl. Where do you want us to cut the compartment, huh? Under the seat? The wheel well? Do what to the compartment? Cut up your truck. What are you talking about? Cutting up the... Look, nobody's gonna cut up this truck, understand? Put whatever you want right back there, next to the golf clubs. It'll be safe. No problem. You're fucking crazy, huh? Yeah. - Take it. - What's this? You answer this, day or night... But you don't call anyone. When you get to the drop, someone will text you. Text? You know how to text? Well... Hold on to the phone. If it rings, you answer. Here. When you get to the hotel, park your truck. Put the keys in the glove compartment. Then come back in an hour. Your money will be in the glove compartment with the keys. Do you understand? Si, si. I understand. But what would happen if somebody steals the money or my truck? No one will fuck with it. We got eyes everywhere, viejito. Oye, viejito. Do yourself a favor. Don't look in that bag. You might think you can identify us, or know about this tire shop, but don't forget, we know who you are. Comprende. I'm not gonna look in anybody's bag. Okay, papa. Thank you. Come on. Adios! Welcome to the team, Agent Bates. Thank you, sir. Go ahead and have a seat. So, how's your family adjusting to the move? Do they like the city? I'm assuming you don't want the truth. No. Listen, you made some big cases in New York and D.C. and I'm expecting you to do the same thing here. - Yes, sir. - Good. No one wants to sit through these long Chicago winters but we got crime coming out of our ass. That's how you get out of here. Work hard, make cases, make busts, make your name. Then maybe you can move on. Well, that's the best news I've heard all week. Good. Now get out there and make a splash, Special Agent. Yes, sir. Agent Bates? - Agent Trevino? - Yes, sir. - Pleasure. - So, I'll be your number one. - Yeah, I heard. It's an honor. - Yeah. - How you feeling? - I feel good. Ready to make a big splash? - He says that to everybody. - Yeah, he does. That's all right. So your office is out here, to the right. Well, I'm not gonna spend too much time there. Hopefully not. Jesus says that he came to seek and save that which is lost. ♪ Spending time with you ♪ I love you more today than yesterday ♪ But not as much as tomorrow ♪ Jesus, it's like the Star Wars cantina in there. Yeah, it's where all the homies hang out. It doesn't look like a TED Talks. It's my kid's. He helps me pack. You got kids? Yeah, five of 'em. Five. How do you make that work in a job like this? We just make it work. Ah, the plot thins. - Why's that? - This is our guy. Yeah. Right there. Shit. Oh, shit. - Yeah? - You did good. Supposed to tell you to call this number any time you need work, all right? Here you go. No, no, no, no. This is just a one-time deal for me. Well, I tell you what, man, why don't you call us if you change your mind? You know what I'm saying? Here you go. Take the number. Here. Why don't you save that for a rainy day? Yeah. Yeah, a rainy day. Okay. All right, let's go. Come on. Let's move it up out of here. All right. All right. It's the starter, the starter's pretty ratty. Let's go. Come on. Back it up. All right. I got it. Everybody's on their cell phone. It's becoming an epidemic. What do you think you're doing? Who the hell are you guys? My name is Special Agent Colin Bates, this is Agent Trevino. We're with the Drug Enforcement Administration. And you're Luis Rocha. And we're here to save your life. I beg your pardon? We're gonna make sure your cartel doesn't know you're working for the DEA. I'm not working for the DEA. No, but that's what they'll think if you don't, so welcome aboard. Wait, I don't know what you're talking about. I like the Tahitian Pearl. It's got, like, a nice sheen. Think about it, Luis. We got a warrant to search your house. What? Yeah, we'll see you there. Hi. I'm gonna interrupt for a second. - I'm sorry. - He's yours. Hi, everyone. Before I get over-served... ...we'd just like to take a moment to say thank you. Um... Mom, I love you. - Aw. - I love you so much. Grandma Mary, thank you so, so much for everything that you've done. Um... And to my Grandpa Earl, who brought the flowers, of course. And covered the open bar. So, thank you. Hi. Hey. You look lovely tonight. It's kinda funny, our granddaughter getting married. And we worried all those years about her finding Mr. Right. Earl, why do you think you could just sit down and expect me to forget about the past and reminisce about old times? Well, we had 10 good years. We can still be civil. Care to dance? You always liked this tune. I do. No, I can't. I just can't. I can't. I see you're still into your flowers. Yeah. I never understood how you could spend so much time and money on them. I love 'em. I mean, they're unique. They just bloom one day and that's the end of it. They deserve all the time and effort. So did your family. Not bad, viejito, not bad. Damn! Badass, right there. New ride. Nice. Yeah. Badass is right. - Yeah. - This is beautiful. Yeah, the old one finally quit on me. Hey, Earl. Got a little present for you. What's in that? Your jale, old man. Your cargo. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. All right. Hey, what's going on, big poppa? Yeah, good. Just everything good. I'm just on the road again. - You're king pimping? - Yeah. Kind of like that. - Yeah? - Same as before. It rings, you answer. Day or night. Yeah, well, you know, I've got this other one from before, too. - Yeah. Let me see. - Yeah. - Yep. - Ah, I see. Hey, that was a perfectly good phone. What's going on? Earl, you throw your phone away when your run is done. I don't suppose you learned how to text yet either, huh? I can text. I'll be able to. Next time you see me, I'll be texting. Texting my brains out. Okay. Looking good, abuelito. Okay. Hey, Earl. Yeah? Same hotel as before. Yeah, same hotel. I'll be there. Okay. Vamos. 1980 Shovelhead. I ran one of those things into the ground. It'll probably be the relay, son. Who you calling "son"? Oh, you're gals, huh? Gals? Come on, old-timer, we're dykes on bikes. No shit. Okay, well. So, you think that's the issue? The relay? It's a good early check. It'll be the relay. Thanks, Pops. You're welcome, dykes. - You crazy motherfucker. - Crazy old man. Think about our offer, amigo? No. And I'm Filipino, not Mexican. Well, that's a good thing. It'll be harder for the cartel to get to your family. Why do you think I'd work for you guys? I mean, we found drugs, $425,000 in cash and three unlicensed firearms in your house, so I mean, that's a start. Not to mention fraud, tax evasion, money laundering, state and federal drug laws you've broken. I mean, conservatively, I'd say you're looking at back-to-back life sentences. And I'm no psychic, but... Looking at your manicured nails and your exfoliated skin and your scented candles, I don't think you're gonna fare too well in prison. Oh, it's definitely bitch material. You'd be somebody's girlfriend in a day. You wouldn't like that, would you? And that's before the cartel gets to you. So, what do you think, Luis? Are we gonna be friends? What do I do? Just do your job, go back to work, be a good cartel employee and answer my calls day and night. - Okay. - Good. The foreclosure will be canceled with your reinstatement payment. Plus late fees and incidentals. You said you had cash? Yeah. Right here. Okay. Piece of shit. Motherfucker. The hell happened here? Fire? Yeah, in the kitchen. Nobody got hurt. Oh, good. I'll have pancakes, then. Yeah. Yeah. Unfortunately, the insurance company's jerking us around. We might not see any money for years. Yeah. Well, I've been coming here since '58. This place is like an institution. I don't know what the hell the vets are gonna do. I don't know. No Sunday night polka parties. No more meat raffles. What the hell, pretty soon it'll be no more VFW. Yeah, I guess so. Well, that is unless... Not unless somebody's got an extra 25K laying around. How do, how do, how do. Bienvenidos, Senor Earl. Welcome back. Oh, thank you, thank you. What's up, big poppa? Not too much, not too much. Same old, same old. Just on the highway. What's going on? Look at this. Wow. What's in that? That's big. Don't worry about it. - Hey, Earl? - Yeah. Oh, yeah. - It rings, you do what? - I answer. - That's my man. Big poppa. - Okay. I got you. Remember, con cuidado when you drive. Just drive safely. - Okay. - Si. Drive safely. All right. Okay. Hey, Earl. Keep your eyes open. - All right. I will. - All right. - Okay. All right. - Vamonos. Holy shit. Holy shit. Need help, sir? Oh, uh... Officer, hi. Need any help? No, no. I'm fine, thank you. What do you got there? Pecans. I'm delivering pecans to my niece. - Pecans? - Yeah, pecans. She makes the worst pecan pie you've ever tasted. I feel sorry for her husband, but... And I feel sorry for the pecans, too. I don't know what's wrong with him now, but this dog has to pee every 15 minutes. Dogs. Oh, shit. It's all right. All right, calm down. Come on. Hi! Hi. Hi, doggy! How ya doing? Take a sniff of that. I'm sorry, sir, I'm gonna have to ask you not to touch the animal. - I'm sorry, Officer. - It's okay. It's okay, sir. I had no idea. I'm sorry. - My Dukie, I miss him so much. - It's okay, sir. Dukie, you know, Dukie just one of those dogs that everybody loves. - Drive safely, sir. - Okay. - You can go now. - Yeah, thank you. You do a great Jimmy Stewart, by the way. Yeah. Fuck. Let me explain something, Luis. For you to get into witness protection, you're gonna have to prove your value. We win, you win. So we're gonna go on a little sightseeing tour. See what kind of value you can offer. - You understand? - Yeah. Good. Got you a latte. This is where it start, not just here, but dozens of hotels across the city. Mules come in from various locations, loaded, leave their vehicles, someone takes the vehicles, removes the load, and returns it with the mule's payment. At 121, there's a guy outside. What's going on here? 121 is ours. He's just there to make sure that they keep an eye on the vans that come in and out. What else? Fuck me. Oh, shit. Okay. All right, just settle down, boy.

He stops wherever he wants. He doesn't follow my instructions. He doesn't do what I tell him to do. Yesterday he stopped to see an old friend. I'm just gonna kill him. - I won't tolerate... - Slow down, slow down. Listen to me. Listen to me. He moves his own way. He's been successful. If he changes his route, it's probably better for us 'cause then he's less predictable. You understand me? Yeah, but we don't oblige the other drivers like this. You need to oblige me. Understood? Yeah, understood. Stay with him. Make him feel at home. Other than that... How you doing? I'm fine. Okay. Do your job. Si. Si. What do you got? I'm taking all the risk here. If they found out that I'm talking to you guys, I'm dead. Maybe don't work with drug dealers. Got you a latte. Feel better? So what do you got for us? I don't know if I should be doing this. What do you got? What's this? It's a freight manifest. What is this? Code? Symbols for each of the mules along with symbols for their routes, dates, and cargo loads. There's this new drug mule, Tata. New guy. He's delivered 121 kilos in April, 172 kilos in May, and then 232 kilos. Jesus Christ. Could that be right? This guy's nickname's, Tata? - Is that right? - Yeah, that's Tata. That's good. Good work. I'm just gonna need to document this. I gotta get that back before they know it's gone, though. So if I can just take it now. It's just gonna take a second, so just relax. You play hard to get for a snitch. And you end up snitching anyway. I just need... Just think about who else you can snitch on while you're waiting. No. Come on. I'm just... Reflect on that.

Yeah, well, that's 'cause they see two beaners in a bowl full of crackers. Why are we here? The best pulled pork sandwich in the whole Midwest, that's why. Not bad, huh? See, what you gotta do is take more time out, like this. Enjoy life. Like I do. Maybe. Or maybe you enjoyed the moment a little too much. Had too much fun. That's why you're working for us now. Best pulled pork sandwich in the whole wide world. No more stopping, Tata. You stay on route. Losing my patience. What's your business here? I ain't gonna ask you again. What's your business in my town? Officer. Officer. I can vouch for these fellas. They're actually working for me. You know this guy? Yeah. I got 'em down at Home Depot. They came out here, and they've been helping me move. Great job. A lot cheaper than the moving company, I'll tell you that. Terrific job. Yeah, could you come over here for a second? There's something very important I want to show you in this truck. Right here. Really important. Really important. You'll love this. I went to a charity and I got this caramelized corn. And it is really terrific stuff. We can't accept this kind of stuff. You'll be doing me a great favor, if you would. I've got diabetes. I can't have it. They'd love it down at the station. And the gals upstairs, they'll love it, too. Thank you for helping me, sir. All right, sir? I'm very big on law enforcement. Very supportive. We appreciate what you do. - Our numbers are down, Special Agent. - Yes. Yes. I realize we're down. The numbers don't reflect the actuals, and will be adjusted by the end of the day. - Fix 'em and send 'em over... - Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Today. Yes, sir. What? Cartel's top mule's on his way to a drop. So we know the route. We know it's a black pickup. It's a needle in a haystack, but at least it's a start. How do we know this? Phone tap. They thought their mule was in an accident. Turns out it was a pickup on Interstate 55. When's he due to arrive? 9:00 p.m. That puts us five hours out. So if we have local law enforcement stop vehicles of that description, do a random road check, we can catch this guy without tipping off the cartel. This is the guy you think is moving over 100 kilos into Chicago a month? 100 kilos is overzealous, considering we're only confiscating five kilos a month. Is that a yes or a no? Yes.

I want you to take good care of Earl tonight, okay? Tuck him in and stay with him. Make him feel good. Of course. Don't hurt yourself, Tata. I won't. - This is... - Lay down. - Beautiful. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Do you like it? I love it. Oh, God. Sweetheart. Wow. What do we have here? You guys having some fun? Well, we were just relaxing a little bit. It was nothing. I think we'd rather have fun. I think that a little heart medicine wouldn't hurt. You're fine. Here, let me grab these lights for you. - One light will do. - Yeah, get comfy. I need to call a cardiologist. Doctor Clark. Hey! Mr. Life Of The Party. - Yeah. - You having fun? - Yeah, I am. - Yeah, you are. - I saw you. - I was having fun all right. I've been looking for you. - For me? - I was looking for you. Oh, yeah? Yeah, I thought I'd give you a little advice. You're... You're giving me advice? Yeah. Yeah. I... I pass. I think you ought to quit. Quit? Quit what? Quit this. Quit here. These people don't give a crap about you. You know, you could quit, find something you really love to do. And then go after it. Wait, wait, wait, what are you talking about? Let me tell you something, okay? This is my family. This is my home. - Yeah. - Okay? Laton... He pulled me from the streets. I was nobody. I was nothing. Okay? He gave me everything. And here, I'm somebody. Yeah. Yeah. So what are you talking about? Well... Hell, just an idea, you know? Earl, Earl. Wait. No, no. Where are you going? Hey, I'm gonna go up to my room. There I'm somebody. No one wants to tip off the cartel, but we have to show some kind of progress with this case. But you're talking about a PR stunt. In Arlington, there's a table of administrators sitting around just like us, only they're wondering what the hell we're doing, and if maybe someone else wouldn't be more productive. We need busts, Agent Bates. Well, there's an alleged, stash house that might be getting a shipment in the next couple of days. That's more like it. - Possible busts. - Good. Have to look like local PD, though. To the cartel. Our report will reflect it's from our operation. Do it. But I want busts. You heard the man. It's tricky. Splish-splash. Any last minute orders? Yeah. Nobody shoot me, unless absolutely necessary. Nah, it's your show, Captain. We're just tourists here. All right, gentlemen, you heard the man. Business as usual. Weapons hot. Police! Get down! Get on the ground! Get on the ground! Get down! Move! Stay down! Get down! Get down! Get on the ground! Don't even think about it. Don't move! Five of these. We got what they wanted, I suppose. Yeah. Two nobody illegals and a few bags of coke to lay out for the press. Guess now I can retire. Glam Cosmetology welcomes the friends and family of our graduates. Thank you so much for being here today to honor these lovely young men and women who are following their dreams. We are so proud of our graduates. You're a glutton for punishment. No. I'll have you know I was invited. And now they are moving on to the next chapter of their lives. Tonight, you are barbers, hair designers... What are you wearing? It's just a gold bracelet. You like it? We all need to take a pause and savor this day. Reflect on the journey, the challenges, and the obstacles... What are you doing here? I'm just trying to make up for lost time. And, I do feel that education is important. Well, thank God she finally scrounged up enough money to finish school. Yeah. Thank God. You? Impossible. What's the matter? You okay? It's nothing, it's nothing. It comes and goes. - It's nothing. - All right. No worries, no worries. I'm fine. I'm fine. - All right. - I'm fine. Pull! Gracias. Pull! Gustavo. Laton is gone. He was getting too lenient. The DEA is cracking down, and I'm not gonna rot in prison because of his deficiencies. So, I got rid of him. It's my show now. No more tardiness. No more going off radar. Everything goes according to plan. No deviations, no excuses. Everybody gets with the program, or they go away. I don't care who it is. And yes, this goes for your gringo, too. You have a problem with that? No. Here's your burger. - Thank you. - Thank you. Change of plans, viejo. You follow us. Where are we going? Get out. It's so quiet out here. No one for miles. I want you to listen carefully, viejo. There's new rules. You show up on time. You leave on time. No unscheduled stops. No fucking bullshit, man. All orders are to be followed to the letter. We have a gift for you. Sal. Go. Open, viejo. It's a phone for you. This one you keep. You keep it on you at all times. That's someone who didn't follow orders. So you know the routes. We're not gonna babysit you, but we have eyes everywhere. We're only warning you once. No more late shit, Earl. New boss says, you show up late again and you're done. We own your ass, cabron, so don't be stupid, or you disappear. Si. Answer that phone. You do as you're told. Don't be a problem. That's what happens when you're a problem. You end up in the goddamn trunk. - Julio, mijo... - No, no, don't "Julio" me. We're not friends. I'm not your mijo. - Orale, Earl. You're back. - Yeah. What's up, big poppa? Yeah, it's me. And I gather you guys own my ass. Come on, man. It's not that bad. Ready for another trip, una mas? Okay. All right. Come on, viejito. Let's make some money. All right. That's the spirit. Yeah, that's the Earl I know. Yeah! - What did he give us? - Nothing. But from the wiretap, we know where the mule's going. We know his exact route. So this time, we don't use local PD or state troopers. It's Agent Trevino and myself in an undercover vehicle, Agent Brown in an unmarked making stops. - An aircraft. - And? And that's it. We pull the plug on the whole thing. All the surveillance, all the wiretapping, man-hours, everything, it all comes to a head. It's a lot of busts. - Go get 'er done. - Okay. All right, let's see what we got. They look funny. Nah, between the two of them, they got no more than three grams of coke, guaranteed. Brown, you see this? Yeah, let's pull him over. I'm slowly exiting my vehicle. - How you doing? - I'm not a threat, sir. - Please don't shoot me. - All right. Please don't shoot me. - Don't worry about it. - I'm complying. Relax. Relax. Put your hands on the hood. - My hands are on the vehicle. - Great. You don't have any weapons on you, do you, man? - No, sir, no weapons. - All right. I'm very tense right now. Do you have any drugs in the car? No drugs. Not high, don't have any drugs, never had any drugs. Okay. All right. You know, statistically speaking, this is the most dangerous five minutes of my life. Being pulled over by law enforcement. It's okay. Take it easy. Just breathe. You want me to breathe? You want me to relax? The chances of me dying during a routine traffic stop are greater than... I don't even know. It's the most dangerous five minutes of my life, man, being pulled over by law enforcement. I don't speak Spanish. I... I'm no threat. That's you? - Car is clean. - Okay. Sorry to inconvenience you. Have a good day, sir. Thank you for your service, Officer. Thank you, gentlemen. Have a good day. ♪ And on that road again ♪ On the road again ♪ That's me I'm on that road again ♪ How we looking up there, anything? No. I got no more, man. Yeah, he's not here. Hey, Luis. You don't have him, do you? No. Why? He'll be at the Honest Abe Motel off Interstate 55. Well, that's rather specific. Tata had to get permission from his handler to stop for the night. Does that prove my worth? We'll see. Says he's got a location on him, Honest Abe Motel. Let's check it out. It would work a lot better if you get that damn phone out of your hand. Did I ask for your fucking advice, grandpa? Past your fucking bedtime anyway. All right, scratch 109. That's just a young couple - with kids and a toddler. - All right. No. We got a possible in 203. Solo male, mid-30s. Wait, wait, wait. What's that, right there? What's that, right there? You think that's our guy? Could be. How do you wanna play it? You wanna get local police here on a noise call? Disorderly conduct? No, let's just have homeboy run into the wrong guy. - Everything all right? - Yeah, except I'm trying to avoid some big asshole who's going around here banging his cell phone on the ice machine down there. I don't know what it is with you guys and your generation. "You guys"? Jesus. Don't you guys live life for something outside the goddamn phone? The fuck are you doing? Fuck, I thought this was my room. Yeah? Well, it's not. Wake the fuck up, asshole. Fuck you, bro. What did you say to me? I said, "Fuck you." I don't know if you've heard the news, but it's a felony to assault a DEA Agent. - A what? - DEA Agent. Fuck. Yeah, it's less than an ounce. Maybe 15 grams. See what's in his pickup. Fuck. It's not him. Maybe there's another Honest Abe Motel or maybe it's code? What do you wanna do with this guy? Call local PD, give them the half-ounce of meth and we keep going. Start back up at 6:00 a.m. Get some rest. Come on. - Miss? - Hi. Yeah, I'll have a cup of coffee and maybe you'd fill that thermos for me? - Sure thing. - Thank you. Can I get the, check, when you get the chance? Absolutely. Morning. Morning. Oh, shit. It's the fifth. Oh, shit. I know a lot about "oh, shits." Is that a missed birthday or what? Anniversary. Jesus, I'm an idiot. Yeah. Yeah, I am. Sure. Yeah, you know, she doesn't say, "Happy anniversary." Just let it sit out there, waiting for me to remember. That was really something yesterday, down at the motel. The way you took that guy down. That was something else, I tell you. Sorry if we caused you any disturbance. No, no. It didn't disturb me. It was... That was unfortunate. Well... You gotta think about the family. Yeah. Each anniversary's important. But you've got to think about it because women love that shit, you know? But, you know, I'm the king of missing anniversaries. - Yeah? - That's the problem. Yes. Well, it's the first one I've missed, so... Good luck. Don't follow my footsteps and do what I did. I put work in front of family. Family's the most important thing. Work's fine, if it's in second position. But first position should be family. I've learned that the hard way. My daughter won't even speak to me. Haven't talked to in 12 and a half years. Jesus. Twelve and a half years. It's like I never... Like they were never there, or something. But, anyway, - I'd better pay you. - Thank you. Here, you keep that. - Thank you. - That's fine. Just what you needed, some asshole sitting here, telling you about what you should do in your personal life. No, not at all. Anyway, I want to wish you good luck. You'll need it. And, thank you for the advice. It's good to talk to one of you guys, once in a while. - "You guys"? - You know. - What kind of guys? - You're just willing to... You know, you've lived so long, I think you've probably lost your filter. Really. I never realized I ever had one. - All right. Take it easy. - You, too. Excuse me, sir. Forgot this. Thank you very much. - Have a good day. - You, too. Hello, Ginny. Grandpa Earl, it's Grandma Mary. She's sick. Like, sick sick. We're at the hospital, but they're sending her home. Well, that's good. That's good that they're sending her home. No, it's bad. They did all these tests and scan shit, but it doesn't matter. They said she should've... She should've come in, like, a year ago. Grandpa Earl, are you there? Yeah. You have to come, like, right now. Ginny, I can't. What? Why? They said it could be any day now. I've got this schedule. It's really tight. I've just got so many things. I can't do it. Yeah, right. I took shit for years, sticking up for you. What an idiot! It turns out, I was wrong the whole time. Ginny... I'm sorry. If I could drop everything and go do it, I would. But I'm sorry... - You came? - Yeah. Where's your mom? She's in her bedroom. Okay. I'm gonna go in. Hello, Mary. Earl, what do you want? You're not in the will or anything. I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to say that. I'm just scared, is all. Yeah. Well, the only person who wants to live to 100 is a 99-year-old, anyway. I'm sorry, Mary. I'm... I'm sorry for everything. You lived to get back out there. All the conventions and the socializing and being the center of attention. They got the fun, wonderful man that you are. And we got the Earl who just couldn't wait to get back out there. Yeah. Well, you're right. I thought it was more important to be somebody out there than the damn failure I was here at my own home. Anyway, for what it's worth, I'm here now. I don't know why, but for some reason, I'm so glad you're here. Yeah. Thank you. No answer, again. No good, Earl. No good. We're going to end that fucking Tata. Was supposed to be here a day ago. Maybe the kid lied. Maybe. Hang on, there's a call coming from inside. They don't know where he is either. They sound pissed. Say when they find him, they're gonna kill him. You all right? Good. Earl. Tell me something? Yeah, anything. How did you come into all that money? Well, I just... Well, I'm not gonna lie to you. I'm a high-end gigolo. - Bounty hunter? - Come on. Seriously, come on. All right, seriously. I've become a drug mule for the cartel. And I've got 305 kilos of cocaine sitting right in the back of my truck out there. You're never gonna tell me. Well, whatever you did, you didn't have to get rich for us to want you around. Yeah. I see you finally came out here. See, she didn't completely throw you away. No. I failed you, Iris. I was a terrible father, terrible husband. I just blew it, that's all. Blew my chance. I don't think so. I think you're just a late bloomer. Yeah. They're shitting bricks. They haven't heard from him in over a week. And it's like 12 mil worth of coke, so, I mean, they got people swarming the highways. Good. We have new information on Tata. I have new information, from my boss. - It's time to wrap this up. - Come on, we can get this guy. - It's been months, Colin. - So what's a couple more days? Look, we don't even know if the guy is still out there. You've been allotted as much time and resources as we can give to anyone. You did good work. If you had a few more days while we finalize the warrants, what's your plan? Follow his followers. We tapped the phones of a couple cartel guys that are also looking for him. Okay, do it. Thank you. What? You okay? It's all right. You were the love of my life and the pain of my life. I need you to know, it's all the world to me that you're here. I love you, Mary. More today than yesterday? But not as much as tomorrow. I knew Mary well enough to know that there was no better friend, no better mother, no better mentor. No better listener to those in need. The light that she carried through in her soul and her spirit is something that we should carry on in our own daily lives. The optimism, the hopefulness, even at the end of her days. "Everything works out better than expected," she always used to say. We will miss her, but she would not want us to mourn today. - Thank you, sir. - Very sorry. - Thank you very much. - Yes, sir. - Thank you. - Very, very sorry. Yeah. Hey, Dad. The flowers were really lovely. Well, thank you, dear. Glad you liked them. We'd... We'd like to invite you to Thanksgiving. - Really? - Yeah. Wouldn't miss it for the world. Good. That's him right there. That's him right there. Where you been, Earl? I've been unavailable. Why you making us have to do this, hmm? You were warned, viejo. "Celebrating the life of Mary Stone." Who the fuck is Mary Stone? That's my wife. She passed. Yeah. I know I was warned. I went AWOL anyway so... I won't feel no ill will if you... Whatever goes on here. Just go ahead. Do the fucking... Do what you have to do. Gustavo, we found him. Wait. They're talking about Tata. He was at a funeral. His wife was dying of cancer. Pero now he's finishing the run. Sounds like they're with him. He was warned. I don't care. Si, si, si. They're gonna kill him. Gustavo, he's the best mule we have. I need a lock on a GPS now. And get the chopper in the air. Okay. Let him finish his drop. If he fails, it's your head. Get it done. Okay. We have a location on that GPS track. Illinois, a quarter mile east off Interstate 55, exit 224. All right, here we go. Suspect is moving northbound. Unit one, go ahead and block all northbound traffic. Units two and three, box him in once we're in position. - Roger that. - All right, here we go. It all comes down right here. All right, here we go. Charlie 223, helo 17 on top. Air team, we have a visual. Be smart. Slow down. All right. Let's go. Step out of the vehicle with your hands up! Get out of the car! Driver, step out of the vehicle. Put your hands in the air! Get out of the fucking vehicle now! Get out of the car! Get out of the car! Step out of the vehicle! Put your hands above your head! Keep your hands in the air! Step away from the vehicle! Let me see your hands! Put your hands in the air! - Your hands! - Step away from the vehicle! Turn around, face the other way! - Turn around! - Turn around - and face the other way! - Turn around! Put your hands behind your head and interlace your fingers. Now I want you to take steps back towards me to the sound of my voice. There you go. That's it, keep coming. Here we go. That's it. You. Yeah. Do you need more staties here? No, no, no. We're just gonna talk. Okay. All right. What happened to your face? Nothing. I just got what I damn well deserved, is all. And the suit? Went to a funeral. My ex-wife's funeral. I'm sorry. Lucky, actually. I got to spend some time with her. She let me in and my whole family let me in. My daughter, everybody. Is this the daughter that wouldn't talk to you? Yeah. That's right. You remember that, huh? I do. Well... Am I the guy who's responsible for you missing your anniversary? You know, it's funny. After all this work and the time away, you, of all people, were right. I ain't been right about much in life. Well, you made things straight with your family. Yeah. I'm glad for you. That's the thing. You just remember that. You remember that with your family. You don't need all that other shit. I'll try to. You take care of yourself, okay? - You, too. - Yeah. Hang in there. Earl Stone is a man who served his country, fought for our freedom, and now faces the loss of his own. Murdering cartel thugs who not only took advantage of his good nature, but also his advanced age, his vulnerability. Your Honor... Guilty. Earl. Earl. Mr. Stone, you should talk to your attorney. Earl, don't do this. - Earl... - Guilty, Your Honor. I did it. Mr. Stone, are you pleading guilty on all charges? Yes. Bailiff. Take him into custody. Mr. Stone, you are remanded into federal prison. You did a good job. We'll come visit you every chance we can. Thanks. Mike and I will look after the farm. Don't you worry, Grandpa. I know you will. It's just time, is all. I could buy anything, but I couldn't buy time. It's okay. We love you. All right. Thank you. At least we'll always know where you are. Court is adjourned. - Good work, Special Agent. - Thank you, sir.
