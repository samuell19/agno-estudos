CRITIQUE OF ARMS Marga feels like everybody was... I'm totally stuck. At this point, I have to decide what’s going to happen. If she goes to jail for telling the truth, since she lied before about recognizing the cop Easy! Very good! So, I don't know yet, I’m trying to figure it out What I decided to do is go back and start reading from the beginning, taking my time, and we’ll see. Then what ever comes to my mind that’s what I’ll do. What do you think? What’s wrong? I just wanted to talk to you. What it is, honey? Look, what a mess, the thread got all tangled. I won't be able to unravel this, I can’t see anything. Fix it for me? I can’t recall exactly, but I think there was a time when it was right during the last war or... just after the war, when they still had many needs, and she fell in love, my mom, she fell in love with this singer, she called him a troubadour who went from town to town, and sang. Anyway, she fell madly in love. And decided to go on the road with this troubadour. Imagine, in those times, what a scandal! Can you imagine? And the thing was, how was she going to leave with him? Because she was a minor How old was she? She herself doesn't even know, she doesn't remember because she left using her cousin’s papers who was already 18 years old. We think your grandma was around 13 or 14 years old, something like that. In those times girls would marry much younger. Anyway, the thing is, she took a boat and came after the singer. What we don't know, because she doesn't talk about it much is if the singer came with her on the boat or if he waited for her I don’t know how they met up over here. So in the end she was so madly in love she came to Buenos Aires but the troubador kept “troubadoring” around in other cities. Nooo! Really? Of course, he left. I think they were together two months or so and he left her. So she put together a life for herself however she could. Were you ever intrigued to go visit? Not really. Really? I would love to go to Europe... to Italy but not to see her hometown. Maybe it’s because mom always told us how miserable they were there. I just don’t feel to fondly about the place. Euge! You know I'm not a professional, this isn’t my specialty give me a second. Like this? Yes, like that. Give me a second. Finally... Now they can't say we are not true friends. Sorry, I have to finish this. I'm going to finally focus on my own professional development pursue what I always dreamed of. It didn't work out with him, it might with someone else or maybe no one. I’m not thinking about starting another family on my mind right now. I want to dedicate myself to ME. Take care of myself, something I have never done. Now is my moment, which feels good. It empowers me to find myself again as a woman and continue forward. It’s ok like this right? Yes, that’s fine. Now put a couple more and add the little roundy ones. This one? So Cristina, I hope you listen to the advice of your mom and myself: none of this getting married without really getting to know. You’ll regret it later. We would like to invite to board those passengers with small children Do not try to make any last minute purchases, boarding has begun… Every month they take a percentage off your salary. For example, you're studying math, right? Uh-huh. Like, if you earn 100 they'll take 3 or 4. And they put it in an separate account. And later when you reach a certain age, like me, you won't work and you'll receive every month what you were saving in that retirement account. - Anyways, Cheers! - I don't want to hold it! I'll help you. What happened? It's always too hot for me. Yes to EVO! Cochabamba says NO! In this car I would take everything from you even to dynamite. You never told me that story.

What are you doing at school with the cap, Emilio? I don't know. They haven't told you? They never tell us why, they just ask us to buy things. It’d be nice if you visited the school one of these days. How are your ex-guerrilla friends? They're okay. We meet up sometimes to reminisce about old times Laugh a little What else can we do now. Now you can laugh. We all go to vote for the left wing party since she is a kind right wing... what can we do? He's big And well mannered.

Oh, that face - Snake face - True, that's true... you are impolite and deeply disrespectful but beautiful - You see? - And crooked like your father. What happened with your husband? - I'm done with him, it's over. - He's out of the game. It didn't work out. Well, It's a good opportunity to start over.

Can you send me my wedding gown? Sure, why do you want it? I want to sell it, actually. I think the most important social and legal conquest for women of the XX century is not the vote but the divorce. There is also the opinion that divorce is the principal cause of the fragmentation of the most sacred institution. No, that's nonsense. First, because the family is not a sacred institution. Family is a valid nucleus of coexistence as far it promote tranquility, affection, democracy, equality. In the meantime, do you want to come work with me? Like an assistant? Of course, my pretty assistant. Really? Sure, why not? What would I have to do? Nothing... really nothing! Okay, I'll accept the offer. I wouldn't pay you... just kidding. - Another internship. - Exactly. So, you start from... nose, eyes and eyebrows. Shit. I missed ton. Just a little. So, I have to fill in from here... Yes. Ok. It should end at the nose, eye, and eyebrow. - That sucks - Yes. Ah, but that's how life is I mean, it hurts at the beginning... but what can you do. - Are they still together? - They are. Did he ever contact you again? Of course he still calls me... - Really, what an ass. - Yes, he needs to fuck off. That's why men marry... - What do you mean? - I mean, to cheat. Why do you think he married? Because he was too old to be single If at that age you are not married you're a fag, darling. Okay. Two, thirty one. Eliana Lujan 70731231, right? Perfect, so we will see you Saturday 13th, at 6:30 p.m. Sure, no problem. Thanks, good bye. Hello. - Hello. - How are you? Come in, have a seat over here. Thanks. Seriously, I went to a job interview all happy with my CV, everything going well and when I said I was married with kids "No, I'm sorry. We are looking for single candidates unmarried and definitely without kids and responsibilities" That sucks... because a person with responsibilities, has more necessity to work if not, they wouldn’t be looking for a job. And you know how to handle all tasks. - So you are more responsible. - Yeah. And... I got up and walked out pissed off. I sent them to hell in my mind. I hated him with all my guts, I kicked my car, I went nuts. Your grandma, every year would walk to the Urkupiña pilgrimage. Really? She would walk from the house all the way up to calvary, she would walk about 13 miles. You really have to be faithful to do that. Even in this life full of sorrow even without riches for others. Beyond the sun beyond the sun she has a home, a beautiful home beyond the sun In the name of the father the son and the holy spirit amen Thank you. THE BROKEN WOMAN (NATIVE LANGUAGE) Granma? Look, it fits. Damn, you would be a bride... divine! She has to think it's one of those inherited dressed that made someone happy now it will make me happy, It's a magical dress! - You'll say that. - Sure. There should be... more room here. You can't tell with... the creases. Do you like it? I just don't want it to be noticeable. If I sit, can you tell? You can’t tell. - Here's the strap. - Thanks. Hold it. Alvaro! And how do you want your hair? What time is the ceremony? During the day. Pulled up would look nice. Yeah. We could do her hair and makeup as a wedding gift. But, I'd like to put a chip on the back. Or a GPS bracelet to know where she is at all times. Damn! No, there's no way. I'll go with Diego and Pancho to learn how to shoot. A fuckin’ rifle, pow! The first boy that dates my daughter I'll ask him to sit in the living room while I rake my rifle "So you want to date my daughter?" And her character is a spy. It's a movie about espionage and guerrilla. You will love it. The film is based on the true story of Tania. Did you hear about her? Tania was a guerrilla woman in Che's time. And I feel film industry never gave her a chance. If you watch a movie about Che, she is just an extra, never a principal. You know why? Because the film industry is "machista". But that's a different story. Basically, it's a film about women and female intuition. I understand you are not a professional actress. I've never done acting, I’ve never even been in front of a camera. All you have to do is be yourself. Just be yourself the way you are right now. Just that. You have a power. I feel it, you really have it. In this moment I can feel it, for sure. So, my inner being or my inner self feels you are that person and he is confident about that. Well, thanks for that. What do you say? - Will you do it? - I'm not sure. To be honest, it scares me a bit. It's something I have never done before and I don't know you either and I'd like to know if you've made another film. Oh, yeah. I can show you what I have done. I haven't show you what I have done. I have some videos. I made the film "God finally abandons me" and it's not a religious film but a film that talks about our consciousness and our soul. I'll show you a small scene. It might not be the best scene that'll make you want to act in my film but it will get you excited. - Where do I press? - Just hit play. That when I hit the cup... I have to... get claim... I have to... get close and see if there's a difference with the sound. So in the film I'll have a person walking down the street and suddenly a crystal glass will appear. Wow and they'll tell him "if you want to wake up you must ring the crystal glass". So that's what I have in the meantime. - How are you? - I'm good. Chilling? According to the director she was a fascinating woman. She lived two lives. She was from German origin Yes, her parents were German. She was raised in Argentina, and she arrives in Bolivia with different name, As a different person, dressed as a different person, she basically lived two lives. Well, in those times... we had to have live two lives. Activists had to work in secret and had to live two lives, and it wasn't an easy life. We had to live watching our backs. What happened that time they caught you in La Paz? That's when they deported me. They arrested me and took me straight to the airport to leave. How old were you? 21, 22, 23, 24 Were you there with my mom? DREAMS OF MASSACRED FREEDOM It won't be a long shooting schedule... but you will be an essential character in the film. There aren't that many characters in the film We are only three for now... - I will also be one of the characters. - Oh really? Yes, I didn't want to tell you yet... Well, I don't want... I need to work with intuitive people that are into it and it's hard to find people that share my same vision that are truly connected. You feel we are all connected? Do you feel the connection happening right now in this room? Yes, usually they come with their hair done. Yes, yes... Your hair will be down... in some scenes. - Beautiful. - Really?, I want to see. Look, darling. Yeah, yep. Guerrilla girl, yes. Absolutely.

YOU ARE IN "WATER WAR SQUARE", THE MOST IMPORTANT PLACE IN COCHABAMBA. Excuse me ma'am, where's Bolivar cinema? It's on Simon Avenue. Close to Sucre Street? Where can we go? You tell me, you're the one that's lived here longer. Thank you. I though they’d forgotten about me. You should never think like that. The Revolution never forgets people who serves it the way you are doing. Do you have something with purple, something more... These, but I'm not sure if they’re right for you I think these fit you better and give you a more elegant look. Honey Sweetheart! - What's his age now? - Six Why is he dressed up as...

So, are you going to move your son? To this new Kindergarten. Well... Yeah. I've been thinking about it and it seems to be the best place, right? Yes. My son is comfortable there. - Hello. - Hello. Where's my dad? He went out with Emi, to soccer. - No, thanks. - Want some tea? - No, thanks. - "Excuse me..." no go ahead, go ahead - These are my friends. She is Eugenia. Don't forget... the plate. Shut up. You are rude. She is pretty. I'm a mother who needs to sell these homemade bun cakes with coconut, strawberry and black berry filling. They are only one bolivian peso. Thank you for your time and have a nice evening. - Hello. - Hello. What did you order? - How was your day? - Nothing, we were waiting for you. - Emi! Great. My class was very funny. Let's suppose a men who was eating a sandwich Ok. So, he took 1,2,3,4,5,6 sandwiches And he was SO big that he can eat them all at the same time. Emi, are you doing your homework? The J's and the G's, remember you had to work on? Here, let me see... You have to write G and J, right? - Here. - Ok. So later tonight you won’t be crying that your homework isn't finished. So here it is. Emi, do you want some water? Hello. Hello. The sun feels good, doesn't it? Yeah... It's nice. What are you reading? Ehhh... A book, about war. What are you studying? Political Science. Interesting... I'm Laura. Hi, I'm... I'm Mario. (HUMANITIES DEPARTMENT) During the XIX century in Latin America Liberals thinkers wanted to be notices by the Europeans and as much as they were regarded felt their ontological entity that is to say, they existed. Europe notices me, therefore I exist. Here they are. This is not the place to hide them. That's what they taught me. We have to start soon with your training until you meet all the requirements. The way I've been working until now, right? You need some training. Did you do your job? Yes. I asked him to marry me. Did you think about it? Look... My family is conservative. I don't think they like our relationship. I’m fucking you not your family. That sounds a little crazy. That's too much, right? Yeah, maybe. But don't worry, let's start again. If a fly appears, don’t worry, you just go ahead. Let's start with the most simple passion and hate. You feel passion for Mario but also some sort of hate. It's not hate towards him, it's hate towards your current situation. You want to be in the mountains, you want to be with the guerrillas, you want to find yourself. And here's this person that you sort of need to use. I guess she's a woman that knows what she wants. - She is very strong, right? - Exactly, totally So, it's obvious that you want to marry me... Marry Mario, I mean. Because I don't think you want to marry me, right? Not really, anyone. Everyone here has to respect the rules. No parties. At 10 p.m. all lights out. Benita! Come in, please. This is your room... the bed, desk, closet, clean curtains, bed comforter and sheets. Benita, this is Eugenia. She will live with us from now on. - Hello. - Hello, nice to meet you. Same as well. As I explained, Benita is the person that manages the common areas if you need any cleaning, laundry, you speak with her, there's an extra cost you can discuss with her. With regards to payment, rent needs to be paid on time - before the 5th of each month. - OK. Because on the 6th, if I'm not paid I will shut off the electricity. We have show that you miss someone and that you are a woman that will want a child some day. And why does she need to want a child? I don’t know, I mean, it is what represents being a woman. So, for her to be a woman she has to have a child if not, she is not a woman. Men cannot birth children, right? It sounds very machista for someone that looks progressive. Honestly, it is credible for you that a character like her wants a baby? The only thing a child will do is complicate her life. - It's late, I have to go. - Do you see her wanting a child? Okay, listen... Every three days a woman is killed in Bolivia. There is a drip slaughter of Bolivian women and my bloodied suit today represents the blood shed. Our hopes, comrades, are the hopes that Left wing Party stomped because we had hope that this society could change to be a fairer society. Also, I have in my head an indigenous headdress representation this people defended the Isiboro Secure national park with their lives where are those who run over human rights Another pending issue is conscientious objection It is not possible that in the XXI century in Bolivia, Man means soldier. Put your hands together for Bianca Shallow! In honor of Marilyn Monroe, tonight in Babel Disco Club. What are you thinking? Nothing, I'm a bit drunk. Really? Want some tea or mate? I'm okay. I don't really drink. Do you need your glasses? To see me... better? You put them on. I wear them sometimes. - Yeah? - They're reading glasses. You need to clean your glasses. At home cooking was always a part of our lives They say that grandma, my dad's mother, was a really good cook So, she was really good? Yeah, amazing cook. And... I hope to be also good at it. Has anyone tried your food and has not gotten sick? Honey... I went to look for the flipper but it's still at the other place. Oh okay, it needs to show first... Anyway, I'm a bit worried about your mother. I trust myself, of course. Does that sounds a bit selfish? To think that, the person, I mean I don't know but I always have this feeling that I will end up hurt You mean... that happened to me, in my previous relationships I don't want to go through this again. I could see in your eyes some kind of desperation and the intrigue of looking for answers and not being... able to find it. You mean you notice my desperation? I'm not sure I would use "desperation" to describe it but you seems to me a person who is lost I mean... someone whose eyes reflect she is completely lost. Am I wrong? - What time is it? - Late. - Do you have plans? - No. No plans... nothing. No boyfriend? No, thank god. Why?... Okay, so drink. Bottom’s up. If we’re talking about men, bottom’s up. He was... my high school sweetheart. It lasted a long time... He is... It didn't work. How long were you together? We dated 4 years, married 2 years. - That's a long time. - Yes. Long time to get to know someone, right? Yes. But it's over. Now we are okay, with our own lives and that's it. - You're so bad. - Why? The way you push the glass. It's the way to be strong. Oh, okay. I'm not bad. I like that. I'm Ok. Sorry for having left without saying anything I could never have explained what was happening inside of me. It was not easy to make that decision, especially to leave our son. You are not the reason I left, not even myself but our son. Thanks for being always my guide. I'm finding myself every minute something I've never done. I'm beginning to understand things that distance reveal. There are things inside of me that are not in place and I'm trying to fix it. I hope to hug you again soon. Say to Emi mom is coming back soon and I took just a vacation. Done. Perfect. Try doing something with your hands. I like it. Move your shoulders to the side. Breath deeply. Shit! ARE YOU PREGNANT? WE CAN HELP YOU. CALL: Emi, come to help me. Leave your brother alone. Let him help. Sweetie, can you bring me my beer, please? Bring me a glass, too?
