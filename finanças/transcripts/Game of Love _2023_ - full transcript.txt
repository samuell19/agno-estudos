"Match." "Like a good 'Chess' match. Your turn. FreeHugz." "Hooked." Ooh! Hm! Sounds athletic. Are you serious? You've had that card up your sleeve the entire time. Well, I saved the best for last. Ah, well then save my pride. Okay, we're doing another round. Oh, no, absolutely not. I believe you have someplace to be. Oh, yeah, Evie, about that. Audrey, no, you don't, he's expecting you, now you can't just go into one of your- Okay, Evie, I appreciate the gesture, I do, it's just- I've made promises. To whom? To Phyllis from yoga. Phyllis from yoga? Look, it's her son and he is very cute. I know, but blind dates are, they're horrifying, okay, they're terrifying and I get very nervous and awkward, when I don't know exactly what I'm walking into. Audrey, Phyllis is counting on this and I don't wanna have to change my yoga. Okay, fine, so you don't have to change your yoga class. I'm gonna, you know what, I'm gonna do this, so you don't have to, yeah. I'm speaking to you as a friend, but please tell me, that you are gonna go home and change first. Is that better? You've made it worse. I know you love me. I'll see you here next week. Off you go, have fun. Well, I'm not making any promises. Bye. Oh. Oh, ah, Alan? Ah, yeah. Yeah. Audrey. Hey. I'm late obviously, but why dwell on the past, right? I'm here now, so and wow, wow! This is nice. Yeah, I'm guessing you didn't know. No, no, but in my defense, I didn't look you up either and that's nice. We should probably grab our seats. Yeah, let's grab our seats. Sorry to interrupt, miss, but we have a dress code here at Chameleon, no denim, no sneakers. Oh, get outta here, that's. I'm gonna have to ask you to leave. Really, really? Yes. Wow. Ah. Thanks, I'm sorry. Oh. Ah. So you didn't look up my face? You clearly didn't look up the restaurant and just flew in there blind? I don't really believe in putting on a front. Right and for you, that's? Not conforming to society's expectations. Wow, she's calling me a conformist. Oh, ah, no, ah... I gotta meet somebody. "Got that right." Oh, oh, oh, hold that! Thank you. Hey, Audrey, we haven't met yet, I'm Patty, I just started in the graphics department. Hi, Patty, I hope you're having a good time so far. Working here is a dream and I guess I have you to thank for it. Oh, yeah? It was one of your games that inspired me to wanna work here, "Ocean Adventure." Oh, that one left an impression, huh? I, I know you're busy, but I would love to hear how you got that idea and got your start. Oh, it's not that interesting, I promise. But welcome to the company. Don't feel bad, I've been here three years and I've never seen her take anyone under her wing, she's not much of a team player. Everyone get settled, I have an exciting announcement to make. As your CEO, I am proud of our growth in the quest and adventure game market, but for our next game, I want us to boldly go where we've never gone before. We are going to create a game about love. Love? Mm-hm, it's called "Love Life." Why would we make a game about love? Well, in times like these, people are looking to rediscover that spark of connection, I mean, to explore the most elemental of all human emotions, ah, it's so exhilarating! The chairman of the Board of Directors suggested it, but I thought the idea was crackerjack. I can't wait to work on it. Audrey, I want you to drop everything and design "Love Life." Me? You want me to design a, no, no. I'm not a, I'm not a, no, are you sure? With all due respect, designing a game about love is the direction you wanna go? Sales potential is very promising. Everyone, this is Matthew Reynolds. He's a marketing consultant we have brought on to handle the rollout of the game, highly recommended by the Board. Thanks, Susie and thank you, everyone and I'm thrilled to be here and help expand the company into an untapped market. I'd really like us to make a splash by delivering "Love Life" in time to be considered for the Tabletop Awards. The Tabletop awards are only four weeks away, I mean, that's half the time that we normally have. But it's been several years since we've won the award for Best Game, so the Board has made this a priority. I know you are all up to the task. I... They are. Listen, I have the marketing strategy all down. The only thing left to do now is for you guys to just make the game. Oh, yeah. We just need to make the game. I'm sorry, have you ever designed a game before? Oh, no, no, no, I've, no, never designed a game before, but that is what you and your team are here for. Yay, teamwork. Hey, Audrey. Yeah. Listen, I think we may have gotten off on the wrong foot here. We've been assigned to work together and although we're in different departments, I think this could be a really good thing. Yeah. About that, um... Why don't we brainstorm over coffee? How about a board game with a countdown timer? That could be fun. How about? Undo, yeah, yeah. How about a board game with a countdown timer- No, I already ran that scenario and if you were thinking meeples, it's far too fiddly and definitely no on orthogonal movements, because I mean, nobody wants like a point salad. Okay, then are you gonna clue me into your ideas? Because I mean, you're just throwing made up words at me right now. No, no, no, no, they're not made. Of course they are. They are official gameplay design terms. - They're official? - Yeah. Okay, listen, has it ever occurred to you, that I could actually help? I mean, I do have all the data points, that the markets are leading into. Okay, you can't design a game off of marketing. What you're gonna get is something just, you know- - Good? - Soul sucking. Or you'll get something that's specifically tailored to an audience that I'm sure they'll love. Yeah, good, great, great, great, great. You come up with your idea and then I'll just be over here- - Not liking mine. - Kind of coming up with my own. So I guess competitiveness is your brand then? I'm not competitive and I don't have a brand. Everybody has a brand, mine is savvy professional, yours is stubborn, indie creative. Oh, okay, first of all, I'm not stubborn. And second of all, I don't have a brand. This, this, this is, this is personality. In today's world, they are one and the same. Okay, are we gonna do this thing? Okay, you present your idea and then I'll present mine and we'll just see who the Board picks. Fine by me. Great. I guess you like to get the last word in too, huh? I do. Okay, love, love, love, love, love, love, love is codependency, sacrificing one's sense of self, that's for sure, jealousy, distortion of reality, loss of control, oh, which is definitely not what anybody wants to do in this game. Love, love, love, love is unplanned. Love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love. Why not rehearse for love? Love is chance. Love is puppies! Kittens! Sunset walks. No, that does not work at all. It could definitely be... Love releases the same endorphins as eating chocolate. What are you doing in here all by yourself? There you are. I got this. Oh yeah, I've got this. I got this. You can toss yours into the shredder right now, 'cause I nailed this. Enjoy the confidence while you can, not gonna last. Hey, guys, we're ready for you. After you. Great. That didn't go well. Crickets. Excuse me, guys, hi. Your presentation, thank you, it was interesting. Let me ask you, have either of you ever actually been in love? Don't answer that. If you're gonna design a game about love, we wanna, we wanna see it, right? - Oh. - We wanna draw from it, we wanna feel it, at the end of the game, we wanna feel like we are in love. Yeah. - Right? - Hm, hm. It's not some marketing gimmick and it's certainly not some heady mind play. Look, I got an idea for you. I'd like to encourage you to take a deeper dive into the love connection. - Oh, for me? - The love connection? You should call this guy, Robbie Indigo. He's here all week. You know, before Robbie Indigo, I, I'd never actually been in love. I know you're probably thinking that's impossible, but I'm here to tell you, that it is possible. Wow. Robbie has a seminar this afternoon and I think you should go. - Got a thing. - Ah! Ah! You should go. Go. It's not a suggestion. I cannot believe that I'm in this position. Don't be so dramatic, you're only down seven points. I'm supposed to be working on my dream project, instead I'm designing a game about love. The universe has a beautiful sense of irony. Yeah, get this, I have to go to a dating seminar with Matthew for it. Well, don't knock it, Auds, you could certainly use the help. How could I use help? Come on, well, maybe to learn to not sabotage every relationship before it even starts. Yeah, I just call it like I see it. And how's that, how do you see it? There was Charlie, the photographer. Too clingy. One date, Audrey. Then there was Jesse, the musician. Too needy. And how about Austin, the writer? The guy was cute. Yeah, too cute. Okay, well, what's the common thread here? They're all really into micro breweries. No, Auds, it's you. So just go into the seminar with an open mind. You never know what surprises await. Like this. Okay, have I ever told you that I hate surprises? Yes. All right, here we go. A dating seminar doesn't sound so bad to me. You haven't met Audrey. Maybe you'll learn a thing or two and up your dating game. Better chance of that than your Bball game. I, well, whatever the case, I need "Love Life" to be a success, Play It Cool is my first big client since striking out on my own. It'll work out. Maybe you'll finally work through your baggage. Wait, my baggage? Ah-huh. Oh, so now, now my brother's a dating expert? I know you got knocked down in the past, but don't you think it's time to get back on the bike? I am on the bike. I date, I had a date last week. And how'd it go? I mean, as you know. Yeah, ah-huh. I just want you to be as happy as me. I doubt it. Okay, 99% as happy. I doubt that. â™ª Ah ah ah â™ª â™ª Ah ah â™ª Wow. Mm-hm. An actual real life love guru. Yeah, well, I have my doubts. Hm, doubts that your love life can't be fixed? My love life doesn't need to be fixed. A little tune up then? Have you ever heard the expression, people who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones? Stones can't break this house. Okay, well, I guess we're about to see. Okay, let's just stick to the research. Agreed. It's no surprise how frustrating dating can be. Dating apps can seem like quicksand, it's enough to make us wonder will we ever find love? Now, how many of you are here looking for that lasting connection? See, look around, you're not alone and I'm here to show you, that it is possible. Wow, there it is. With the Five Indigo Love Connectors. But first, I'm gonna need a couple of volunteers. You two. Come on, there's no reason to be shy, get on up here. - Go. - Us? - Yeah. - What? - Get on up there. - No, no, no, no, no. Did you put your hand up? Let's give them a round of applause. Come on up here. No. So Audrey and Matthew, I couldn't help but notice you didn't raise your hands, when I asked if you were here for love. - We're not. - Yeah, we're, we're... - We're, we're- - We're working together and we're not the kind of people, that need to pay for dating advice. Not that there's anything wrong with, ah. - All of you. - Seeking out a dating expert. Backtracking, interesting. So, Matthew, would you say you were someone, who cares what others think of you? Not really. Not any more than the next guy. Oh, he cares. Okay, Audrey, your choice to reveal that shows a strong desire to separate yourself from others. Would it be fair to assume that you're someone, who only relies on yourself? Nail on the head. I, I mean, doesn't everybody? It's fascinating how we can telegraph our inner feelings, when we don't even mean to. So, Audrey, can you tell us something about Matthew, that you admire? Why back on me again? - Why would I- - Humiliating me like I, I thought this was a safe space up here. - Why did you say that? - Go ahead, Audrey. Just off the top of my head, he's patient, he, yeah. Okay and Matthew, can you tell us something about Audrey, that you find say, impressive? Yeah, I can, I can try that. She's passionate about things that she cares about. Those are some pretty profound traits you've managed to identify within each other, wouldn't you say? Mm-hm. - Thank you. - Well, great. I give you the power of body language! Audrey, when you first got up here, you sat with your arms and legs crossed, one would imagine there was a lot of tension between you two. Well, I mean, describe like a lot. And Matthew, you sat right there with your feet pointed directly towards the exit, like you couldn't wait to get away. Could you blame me? Yeah. Okay. This is what we do when we feel uncomfortable, when we focus on how we might appear to others or how others might make us look. But if we shift our focus onto our partner, everything changes, look at this. After focusing on the positive things in each other, you move to a more open posture, you created connection. By finding the light within our partner, we find it within ourselves, the first step on any journey towards love. Yeah, yeah! Oh, we're not actually on a journey to love. Towards love! Okay, well that was not illuminating whatsoever. Not in the slightest. Yikes. Hi, I hope that wasn't too uncomfortable. You were great up there. Oh, thank you, that was a, yep, that was a, a new experience. Yeah. Well, when you two are ready to further explore the depths of your psyche, you know where to find me. We do. Oh, excuse. Oh. My psyche's better left unexplored. That's because you're afraid of what you'll find. But okay, there's nothing to find. Oh, is that why you called me out in front of all those people on stage in there? Oh, you're angry about that? That was, it was a joke. I'm not angry. Why do you care so much how you're perceived by others? I mean, maybe you should, maybe you should explore that. You should explore that. Hardly. Oh, well, it did give me an idea for the game though. Okay. What if two players start out at different starting points? Okay, what do you mean? You know, like how Robbie was saying, people come into relationships at different starting points? - Yeah. - Some are more open than others, so maybe those people get a head start. That seems a little unfair though, I mean, to the other players, don't you think? Yeah, well, all is fair in love and war. Yeah, well, I'm beginning to think you actually prefer the latter. Oh, I do have an idea though. - Oh? - Yes. What if players judge each other based on their body language? Yeah, no, that would be too complicated, 'cause you'd have to explain to the players what that means and yeah, it just wouldn't work. Okay, fine. Nevermind. Maybe we're getting ahead of ourselves. Yeah, we don't even know what the board looks like, we should start there first. Probably. - Yep. - Tomorrow, yeah? Ah, tomorrow, that sounds good. Yeah, I'll see you tomorrow then. Yep, okay. - Okay. - Yeah. "Being forced to collaborate." And right on time. Technically, I was a few seconds earlier, but that's. Do you just wake up this competitive? Yes, but the caffeine helps. Oh, wow, look at the those. What, why are you looking at my shoes? Oh, they're just really white, kind of need sunglasses to see them. They're supposed to be, they're new. And the style I kinda follow says it's, it's the new trend. - Why is that important? - Because it is. - Oh. - Why do you never dress up? Because I like to streamline my decisions, make room for more important things like choosing a game board. Oh, whatever works. What's that squeaking sound, is that your shoes? That's your shoes. Specifically heard, you know- Not my shoes. I can tell that they're not like, they're kind of like- They're moving, I'm walking in them. - Hey! - Oh! - Hey, Audrey. - Whoa! - There you are. - There you are. - Here I am. - Yeah. Yeah. Hello. Were you guys waiting here for me? Yeah, we know it's crunch time and we just wanted to let you know that graphics and fabrication are available whenever you need us. - Yeah. - That's great. I, ah, I just have so much to figure out, but um, then I'll- Right, so if you want extra hands with that, we are more than happy to help. Okay, that's great. I am gonna jot some things down, then I'll circle back when the time comes. We'll circle back. Ah, we'll circle back, we'll, we'll circle back. - Sounds great. - Okay. Yeah. We'll be here. You're doing great, keep it up. Just, she just, you, you're good. That's so nice, he's so nice. Yeah, that went well. Did it? Yeah. Yeah, okay. Oh! Mm-hm? Are you still working or are you avoiding me? Can't it be both? It can. Ah, oh, where is everyone? It's after eight, everybody's gone home. Oh, I must've lost track of time, I'm still trying to figure out what this board looks like. Well, here's what I came up with during the 1000 years of solitude I spent waiting on you. So the path of squares are laid along the edge, just like "Monopoly." Okay, but what about the middle? Well, I figured we'd use a different game element for that, I just, I haven't figured it out yet. But what does your board say thematically, you know, about love? Ah, well, people live on the edge of their emotions. Yeah, I, I don't know, I have nothing. - Yeah. - What do you, what do you have? I don't know, I was just going for more of a classic configuration, you know, like "Chess" or "Shoots and Ladders." What about the love connection though? I don't know. Okay, well, then what about dinner? Dinner? How are you thinking about food at a time like this? We're gonna be stuck here all night. Well, grab some granola bars or something. We deserve better than that, come on. I have a better idea. Have you ever been to Maison Isabella? The stuffy, pretentious French restaurant? - For field research. - Oh. You know, the game is about romance, why not see it in its natural habitat, right? - Field research? - Field research, we're going. I just have to run a quick errand, it's on the way though. Here. Your quick errand is shopping? Yes, I have someone do shopping for me actually. Oh yes, of course you do. Hey, my stylist, Rachel knows what looks good on me and what's trendy, so. What about what you like? I like what makes me look good. - Ah-huh. - Matthew. - Rachel. - My favorite client. Of course. Muah, muah, let me get the item I've selected. - Okay. - Hi. Hey. - Hm? - Oh! Yes, stripes are going to be so hot this season. - Mm-hm. - Well, as usual, I dig it, so bag it. Excellent. He's so easy. Oh. Gotta keep up with the trends. Still trying to be the cool kid at school? Well, my career is literally calibrating what's cool, so yeah, pretty much. Actually, Rachel, how would you style Audrey? - Oh. - Oh, yeah, no, no. I'm, I don't know what I am. I sense a lot with couples. We're not a, we're- Oh, I know, I mean, I see couples try to change each other all the time especially with what they wear. Yeah, we've been there before. Yes, I know, everyone needs a stylist. I always say life isn't perfect, but your style can be. - That's good. - Mm-hm, yeah. That, that's really good. Thank you. Here you are. - Oh. - Thank you. My pleasure. Ciao. Bye, muah, muah! Nice meeting you. Okay. - Audrey. - Yep, ah. Yeah, Rachel. - Rachel. - Yep. Okay, bye. Bye. Okay. - It's good. - Come on. - She's nice. - Let's go. Seems like she really gets you. Oh. Oh, thank you. So I brought two notebooks. - Ah-huh. - Supplies. - Ah-huh. - Since we are here to work. Ah-huh and don't forget, we're gonna eat while we're here too. Yes, right, sure. I was thinking on the way over here, what if we divided the squares up into categories, like different stages of love? One of them could be first dates, One o'clock. Total first date. Mm-hm, that's a good marketing strategy. Yeah. And couples could play it as a first date activity. - Bon soir. - Oh! Good evening, I'm Pierre. Is there anything I can start you off with? Ah, no, we actually haven't looked at the menu yet. We're just writing down our thoughts. Very well. Take your time. - I'm ready to plate up two. - Oui, oui. Chef, table 24, they are observing everything, writing it down, you know what that means? Food critics. We shall impress them with everything we've got. Oui, Chef. Oui, oui. At the bar. - What? - At the bar. What about a stood up square? - You think he's stood up? - Yes, he's stood up. If a player lands on it, then they have to wait a turn. - That's good. - Put on a Wait sign. That's, oh! Quiche aux poireaux, a classic and it pairs beautifully with an Alsace Riesling, selected by our sommelier. Sorry, we actually didn't, I think you made a mistake, we didn't order this. Compliments of the Chef, the Chef has prepared a special menu for you. - Oh. - Bon apetit. - Thank you. - Oh. I just, we hadn't. Bon apetit. Merci. Does that seem a little generous of them? They think I'm a discerning gumar. No, they don't. What are you doing? I'm aerating the tannins. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. Yeah, just drink your wine. Cheers. Compliments of the Chef. He must like us. Oh my, oh! Oh! Compliments of the Chef. Wow! Compliments of the Chef. Starting to feel kind of like datey. - It's a work thing. - Okay. Compliments of the Chef. Compliments of you. Thank you very much for dining with us this evening. Oh, thank you, yeah. I hope the cuisine was worthy of the brilliant words you shall compose about our establishment. Au revoir. - Au revoir. - Okay. - Merci. - Bye. Bon soiree, a bientot. Yes! Wow! Thank you, but I don't have to eat for all week. That was... Yeah. I mean, I think we came up with some good ideas. Of course. - Right? - Yeah. But whose board game do we go with? Well, speaking of ideas, I had one. So do you remember the signature creme brulee with the caramelized leek crust we just had? Yeah, what about it? Two different flavor profiles working in harmony. Okay, so you, you wanna join board game ideas? Boom. All right, all right, okay, I can, I can do this. Off the top of my head, just spitballing here, what if the players, they started at the bottom corner of the game and they worked their way up the edges of the board game? Because at the beginning of a love connection, the path is obvious. Exactly because it's planned. That's right and then the relationship, I mean, it could go in any direction. There you go. So you meet in the middle of the board game, a player can choose which direction they wanna go, like you want, I knew you had it in you. Oh, I like this, okay and here, I thought we would have nothing for the end of the week for the testing session. But we do. Oh, I'm so relieved. Hey, also. What? Thank you for picking up the check, that was nice. If you wanted to date me, you could've just asked. - I don't. - You could've been like, "Hey, Audrey, do you wanna go on a date?" I would've been like, "You like me? It's cool." Ha! I, I think this will work. - Yeah. - But no. Hey, guys. There they are. What do you got? Here's the mock up for the "Love Life" board. I had my department work around the clock to finish it. I can't wait to see what you all came up with. Yeah, sorry, Patty, we didn't loop you in on that, there just wasn't any time. No, it's okay, I totally understand. I'm sure it looks great. Oh. I love it, this is great. Do you? Hm. What, what's that, "Mm-hm?" - No, you said- - this was our, we put our- - I know. - Our ideas together and we made this thing together, this is what we said, this is great. I-I know, it looks like a bunch of people made it together. Does it maybe look a little busy? Not gonna lie, I wondered the same thing, but there's still time for my department to make a new one. Actually, I have an idea for the board to look a little more cohesive and more on theme. I appreciate the effort, I do, everybody, but this is great, we're gonna go with this board. We're just, we're so close to the testing session, so this is, this is wonderful. Yes, thank you for your input. - Okay. - Yeah, thank you. That's right, thank you for your contribution. You doing okay? Yeah, just trying to figure out the layout of this board game and how to tweak it, you know? Yeah, you know, I, good, I mean, now that we have the board, what's next? Well, we gotta figure out how the players move through it. How about cards, player draws a card each turn, card has a question, they answer the question, depends on how, you don't like it? I was thinking more like dice. Why dice? Well, because it's thematic to the game, you know, like luck of the draw, sort of luck and chance, kind of like love. You think love is a game of luck? Meeting the right person at the right place and time? Yeah, that's, that's luck. Have you ever been in love? What? I, yeah, I loved- I'll take that as a no, don't worry about it. Okay, have you? I have actually once a long time ago. Oh. And I can tell you from experience, that love is not all about chance and luck, it's intention and choice and that's why I think picking cards and the answers to those cards makes more sense. Well, I think we have a long night ahead of us. I can't, my brother and his wife are coming over. Oh. Actually, you should join us. Oh, no, I, I- I think their story will prove to you, that love is not all about luck and chance. I should power through. "Frustrated, the way my current project makes me feel." Oh. - Oh. - Hi. Hey. I wasn't expecting you. Oh, you, I thought, did, you invited me, you sent me the address. You were, I just didn't exp, I didn't think you were gonna show, that's all. Oh, here I am. But you did. I brought you a gift, a game, a game. I see that. Ah, for me? Oh, yeah, come on in. Wow. This place is just as I suspected it. And what did you suspect? Neutral colors, you know, everything just in its place. Looks like it was ripped out of a designer magazine. And that's a bad thing? No, no. Oh, telescope, is this part of the most eligible bachelor collection? - Something like that. - Ah. Is there a significance to this? - No, none at all. - Ah. It's just abstract art is always in. Mm-hm, as I suspected. Oh, that must be Mike and Jacqueline, be right back. So do you guys believe that love is a intention and choice that people make? Or is it a result of luck and chance? Maybe there's a bit of chance involved like- There we go. Being in the right place at the right time. Exactly, yes. But that only takes you so far. I think it's the choice to seek love, that allows it to happen. - My guy. - I got you, bro. You really believe that? Yeah, you don't think so? No, I, I don't. Well, look at us, you know, we both spent years climbing the corporate ladder at the expense of everything else and we finally decided enough was enough and we met at a speed dating event. Okay, see, but this is what I mean, isn't it by chance that you both happen to go to the same event at the same time? Only because we made the choice to be there. Hm. Okay, well, for simplicity's sake, for "Love Life," I think we're gonna have to go with the roll of the dice, okay, it's chance. And I guess being that it's 48 hours away from our testing session, I will concede. Oh, sweet victory. Did I just get that? You did, you did, you did. Well, whatever it was that brought me and Mike together, it worked, when you know, you know. - Yeah, we knew. - Hm. And besides, someone had to pick up the slack after Matthew's engagement ended. Oh. Oh, you didn't tell her about that? No, it hadn't come up until now. Anyway, the game. Yes, the game. The game. - Okay. - We got that. This looks a lot more complicated than it really is. Hear me out. Okay, start with these. Sorry for spilling the beans. Sorry, man, it's not like it's a secret, right. That's why I'm surprised you didn't tell her yet. You two are working on a game about love after all. Exactly, we're working, so there's no need to do a deep dive into each other's relationship histories. Hm. Plus, man, Audrey is closed off about that sort of thing. She's not the only one. What's that supposed to mean? It's just you've changed a little these past few years. Maybe, but there's nothing wrong with prioritizing new things, you know what I'm saying? At the expense of what? Anybody ready for round two? - Saved by the bell. - Mm-hm. Then let's go. We're in. Okay, the thing you wanna remember about testing is you definitely do not wanna- Interrupt them? That's very funny. Oh, you're nervous. I'm not nervous. - Oh, you're nervous. - I'm not nervous. - Little bit. - Oh. Hi, everybody, thank you so much for coming to "Love Life." Well, open the game and have some fun. Why is there so many squares? - Why are they laughing? - They didn't look. I don't understand. Let's just try to figure it out. Look at them, they're confused, they don't even know what's going on. No, no, no, give it, give it to him. Okay, there is green. Honestly, I don't understand what the point of this game is. Yeah, I don't understand how it's supposed to lead to a love connection. It's just not fun or romantic. Oh. This is a disaster. Ring, ring. Please tell me that that's an entirely new, reworked version of "Love Life" in that box. Nope, settle for cupcakes? We can stress eat. Enter immediately. Have you ever had a game fail so spectacularly? Nope. And neither has the company and we need a hit game. What do you mean? Oh, the board game industry has got pretty tight margins as it is and Play It Cool, they were feeling the squeeze this year, so. I had no idea. I feel like I let Susie and everyone down. Well, you're not the only one under pressure, let me tell you, I need to knock this out of the park to prove that my company is a viable asset. Yeah. All right, Mr. Professional. All right, we just need to, we need to, we need to regroup, we need to rethink, right? The general consensus of the game was that it lacked depth, right? We were too focused on the squares with the dice or making our own ideas land, that we forgot the essential elements of what this game was supposed to be. What's that? Well, you know, it was supposed to be about two people, that were trying to connect. Yes and how do we do that? We dig deeper emotionally, right? Oh, ah. We dig deeper emotionally. How do we do that? I've been here for about an hour. I know. Thank you, so you're looking for a shortcut to love? Yes. I think you might be focusing on the wrong element here. - Oh. - Seems to me, you'd have greater success focusing less on the game and more on trying to understand one another. Oh, yeah, we, we understand each other. Yeah, yeah, Audrey never hesitates to tell me exactly what's on her mind, so. - Okay, that's not exactly- - Well, you do. So you know your Indigo Love Connectors. The Connectors? Yeah, my seminar, you were there, the emotional pathways- - Right. - Used to express and receive love from a partner, there are five of them all trademarked. - Yeah, you wrote that down. - I did, I did. - You got that? - Yeah, you were there. - We got that. - But you said partners, Audrey and I aren't partners. No. You are in the creation of this game, are you not? Here, chapter three, there's a questionnaire, that'll help you discover which Indigo Love Connector best suits you. $44. Each? 52 if I sign. - Ah. - 44. I got it. He's got this. Okay, so it looks like there are Five Love Connectors, "Affirming the love, creating the love bubble, receiving the love, love through service and love through touch." Wow, he's really trademarked a whole lot of love. Okay, I think I already know mine, love through service. Wait, when have you let anybody do anything for you? I have. Oh, okay, yeah, yeah. I was just really independent, okay, my parents were doctors, they worked late. They left me with board games to keep me company. So that's why you use competition to relate to people, it's all you knew. One trip to a relationship guru and he's a psychotherapist, ha! - Okay. - Okay. I don't know, these questions seem a little personal. That's the whole point of it. I have an idea, why don't we just do the test? - Mm-hm. - Individually and then we can compare? - Okay, all right. - Okay. You do you, I'll do me and- - Great. - We do we. - I love it. - All right. And I say that with zero irony. So how'd it go? I had some technical issues. - Technical issues? - Yeah, mine's broken. What was your result? Well, it said that my Love Connector was creating a love bubble, so clearly wrong. Was it? Quality time with your parents, that's considered a love bubble. Weren't you denied that as a child? So? So maybe that's what you long for. I, I cannot psychoanalyze on an empty stomach. Okay, this is the best pizza in Seattle. So what Love Connector did you get? Receiving love? - Hm. - Which makes no sense. Okay, well, let me play therapist here for a minute. There's nothing more to uncover. Yeah, okay, well, just off the top of my head, you know, just pulling things down, how about your engagement, that you neglected to tell me about? I knew you were gonna bring that up, I was waiting. Yeah, well, you can't drop a little something like that and expect me not to pick it up. I-I thought we were working on Love Connectors here, not love histories. Yeah, well, I mean, but they want us to, you know, dig deep. Okay. Fine, we were together for three years. Happy? And? Her parents didn't think my career lined up with the image they had for their daughter. Yeah, so she ended it. Wow, what was your career before this, like a tax auditor or something? Astrophotography. As, astro- Astrophotography, come on. Taking pictures of the night sky. That's unexpected. That's cool. So what, they didn't think your future was bright enough or? That's not at all, I wasn't actually trying to- No. I wasn't doing the like the night with the bright. You did, but it's okay, it's all right. - I'm like - It's okay, it's okay. Don't worry about it, don't worry about it. But, hey, you know what's ironic is a star is actually the brightest thing in the universe. That's cute, it's... So do you still take pictures of the stars? No, no, I haven't for a few years now. You could say I rebranded myself. Oh. Yeah. Your Love Connector makes perfect sense. How so? Well, according to our love guru, you know, receiving love is like receiving the perfect gift, it makes you feel seen, valued and understood. Yeah, I don't see how that pertains to me though. - No? - No. Well, you were rejected for who you were, so you know, maybe deep down, all you really want is to be accepted, to feel seen. Is there a cave that I can crawl into right now? Because I'm feeling a little too seen. - Okay. - Yeah. Well, you and me both, so. We are quite the team. Teamwork makes the dream work, isn't that the saying? That is what they say. What? Maybe that's it. What's it? This whole time we've been approaching the game as a single player, but what if we approached it in teams? That's, that's a great idea, players can work through the challenges together. I mean, it would be a whole new experience. And, and, and established couples can prove they've still got. Prospective couples could see if they have a chance! Yes, yes, that's an amazing sales angle, you know what? I'll research other team-based games in the marketplace. - You know what? - What? I've got a better idea, follow me. Okay. Welcome to Boardwalk Cafe. What better way to research the games than to see them in action? - Ah, clever. - Mm-hm. In the marketing world, we call this customer observation. Oh, in my world, we call it a regular Friday night, you know? Okay, okay, okay. It reminds me why I like to design games so much, the joy it brings people, okay. I can see that. Like some prefer more of the classics. Mm-hm. Others prefer what we call more the Euro styles, strategy based and then there's the fantasy games, some campaigns have been going on for a really long time, this one's been going on for three years. - Three years? - Mm-hm. This place is great, I'll give it to you. And you ain't seen nothing yet. And you must be Evie, I'm Matthew. The one and only. So, these are all the best games I know of for playing with teams. Know of a few others, but just might make you blush. Oh! Well, Evie might be the only other person on the planet, that knows more about games than I do. - Well. - Really? So how'd you get into it? Oh, well, that would be my late husband, Thomas. Oh, did you guys meet here? No, met the old fashioned way at a Renaissance fair. Seems like you guys must have been quite the pair. Oh, I think you could say that. I wish I could've met him. And you know what? He would've liked you very much. But you know, we better get cracking. I think we need to recruit a few more players. So, hello, would you like to join us for a game of international intrigue? â™ª Light is shining through the trees â™ª â™ª You're here standing next to me â™ª Okay, orthogonal, what's that? Well, if you were paying attention. I'm trying to win though, she's killing us. â™ª Yet another view â™ª â™ª All feels too good to be true â™ª I have five. â™ª On this perfect, lovely day â™ª â™ª Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo â™ª â™ª Worst luck, Matthew â™ª Maybe next time we put some money on the line. You're saying to me, oh, no, no, no, I have a feeling you'd clean me out. Oh, I would be gentle. I don't believe that. Well, before Evie takes you for all your worth, we should talk about overall impressions. Seems the best part about playing the game in teams is doing the challenges together. Yeah, I agree, it's just creating those ones are quite tricky, especially on a tight timeline. I knew you were gonna say that. - Mm-hm. - The game is now played in teams of two, creating it doesn't have to be. What do you mean? The coworkers at your office, they can help. They could, yeah, except, you know, they got a lot on their plate, they're busy with a lot of other games, so. You do that a lot. What do I do? Turn down offers to help, you just did it to me. You did it to Patty. Nothing wrong with being self-sufficient. Because you think that they may not be there, when you need them, you have a whole team at your disposal. Even if I wanted to ask them for help, I don't know the first thing about managing a team. If you can learn the rules to all these games, I'm sure you can handle it. Wow, he's good, I like him. Have I got news for you. Taylor Swift's got another album on the way? I wish, but this is nearly as exciting, Audrey has called a meeting with us. No way. I know. Well, we'd better hurry, who knows when this might happen again? True team. And that's where we're at. The game will be played in teams. Okay, cool. Good to know. I was wondering if you could help me, if- - Ah. - If you could help Us. Design it in time for the Tabletop competition. - We'd be happy to. - Okay, great. Where do you wanna start? Okay, Patty, you once told me that you had an idea for a board game layout. Oh, right, I just thought, what if the path of the squares on the board were shaped like a heart? And the, the players would work their way up on opposite sides of the heart. Until the winning matches meet in the middle and, and go to the top, yeah, that could work. - Patty! - Oh! That is an amazing idea! How did you come up with that? That's brilliant. The heart, the theme, it's just, it'll make the board pop! How long do you need until you can have it ready? Um, ah, end of day. Good answer and, and Marshall, I'll get the designs for fabrication for you as soon as it's done. Aye, aye, captain. - Yes, teamwork! - Let's get it done. Put it in, we're doing this, three, two, one. Team. â™ª La-la, la-la, la-la, la-la â™ª â™ª La-la-la, la-la-la-la â™ª â™ª La-la, la-la, la-la, la-la â™ª â™ª La-la-la, la-la-la-la â™ª Hey, hey. Hey. For you. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Listen, I know that it must have been stressful for you to ask for help. - Okay. - But I'm proud of you. Thank you. You're welcome. What's that game behind you? Oh, that. I picked this up at a antique store, when I first started here. Oh, well this, this is vintage for sure. - Mm-hm. - Yeah. Who are these people? I don't know. Whoever they are, this board game probably meant something to them, so I keep it as a reminder. Of what? Of why I do this, games like these can bring people together, you know, becomes part of their tradition. I get to be a small part of that, so. That's beautiful. Yeah. I see what you did there. - Right. - Hey, is this a good time? I, I have something to show you. - Yeah, yeah. - Yeah. There are options, I've tried out a variety of heart designs in all different shades, so you can pick your favorites. Thank you so much for the quick turnaround. I have to warn you, I may have gone a little overboard. My love for the Pantone color wheel knows no end. Let me know which one you choose. - Okay. - Oh, Patty, these are incredible. I don't even know how we're gonna pick just one. I know. Okay, why don't we do this? Why don't we just point to the one, that speaks to us the most? Okay, fine. All right. Three, two, one. Try this. You went for the same one. That's my favorite too. "Connection, with someone that took me by surprise. Any advice?" "Lean into it." So we're making great progress, there's just still one element that we need to work out or should I say reconsider? Reconsider? Yeah, something that I was wrong about the first time. Did you guys hear that or was it my imagination? I'm confused. Funny, we need to figure out dice or cards to move through the game. Oh, so you agree that love is about choice and intention? - No, I didn't say that. - No? But our players are choosing to play this game, so I thought that we could, you know, really lean into that. What kind of cards are we talking? Well, cards that present a question or a challenge, is that right, Matthew? Exactly. How a player answers determines what square they move to. And this is where you all come in. See, normally I would draw inspiration from my own imagination, but this game presents a little bit of a challenge for me, so. How can we help? Thank you, I thought we could all brainstorm and come up with, you know, these unique questions or challenges and draw from our own, your own romantic experiences. Marshall looks like he wants to go first, hit me. Well, in that case, we're gonna need a bigger board. Oh! â™ª Damn you, you wanna feel something new â™ª â™ª Hold my hand and let the truth be anew â™ª â™ª Every time you, you wanna dance on the groove â™ª â™ª Hold my hand and let the beat get you through â™ª â™ª I know we oughta show no one should know â™ª â™ª All done now that you're home â™ª â™ª I know we oughta show no one should know â™ª â™ª All done now that you're home â™ª â™ª Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa â™ª â™ª La-la, la-la, hey â™ª â™ª La-la, la-la, la-la, hey â™ª Well, I think we have some pretty good options here. Yeah, we might just finish this game yet. Hey, ah, can I see some of your photography? You just asked me that. Are you, are you serious? Yeah. Okay. You sure? No, I'd rather not see any more facets of your life. Yes, I'm serious. Wow, Matthew. These are stunning. Thank you. Where did you take these? Outdoors. Okay, I'm serious. I took them at the Planetarium. - Hm. - They have a, a real nice view on the roof. I just, I haven't been there forever. Why? Ah, just some things become more important, I guess. What's this one? Sagitta, it's Latin for arrow. You see, the story has it that Zeus was struck by the arrow and afterwards, he fell in love, because the arrow was fired by the Greek god of love, Eros. Wasn't he rebranded as Cupid after that? That wasn't the response I was expecting, but yes. Yes, you are right, he was rebranded just like you. Me, why me? You haven't noticed? You're no longer stubborn, indie creative. - Oh. - Yeah. Now you're slightly less stubborn. - Okay. - Team leader. Funny. I'm just here weaving mythical tales of arrows striking the hearts of gods. Hm. Arrows, what if we had the player pieces made into tiny, little arrows? Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's a good idea, yeah, like a little, small Cupid arrow, when it moved along the board's path. Mm-hm, guiding players to their true love. Hm. It could work. It's late, I should probably, um. You're right, we only have two days before the deadline. You shouldn't keep those locked in a drawer. Thank you for agreeing to do this and I should have asked for help sooner. Oh, hey, you know me, always happy to test out a new game and I can be unbiased with this one, because heaven knows my romance days are long behind me. No, don't sell yourself short. You never know what kind of card you're gonna draw. The deck can be full of surprises. Oh, doubtful, but on that topic, if anyone is gonna draw a suite of hearts, it's you, Auds. Me? Yeah. Why would you say me? Ah, you and Matthew. Me and Matthew? Well, come on, there's obvious chemistry. Well, I, I don't, I-I don't know what you would call it, but he is smart. Cute. He is... Ah, thank you, Evie, for helping me with this. Very kind of you. Okay, got it. You're on fire today, everything must be going great. Yeah, it's about to be game. I didn't mean the game, I meant you and Audrey. What about us? Don't give me that look. I've seen this vibe before when you fell for Emily. Oh yeah, this ain't that. Maybe it could be or are you just gonna roll the dice on this one? Here they are ready to unite two would be lovers. Oh, look at that. Cupid himself couldn't have done it better, come on. Oh wow, Marshall, this gives "Love Life" a whole new meaning. Good job, you really took an idea and ran with it. Thank you. Thanks, so does this mean the game's officially complete? Not yet, we still have one piece of the puzzle yet to solve. Oh, what's that? The ending. Ah. Yeah, we need kind of a big move, a grand gesture to give it all a, I don't know, like a satisfying ending. Well, listen, I mean, we can all come up with something here now, you know, put our heads together. Mm-hm. Well. Yes? I know. You got it. - Say it. - No, nevermind. - Are you sure? - Yeah, I got nothing, sorry. Yes, she's got it. Yes, what? What? No, that's just my friend, Lynn texting about tonight's plan, but I'll let her know I can't make it, we've got an ending to crack. You know what, why don't we just all take the afternoon off? Wait, really? Go, go, get outta here, clear your heads. Boy, Abby and Allison will be thrilled to have me home early. Abby and Allison? Oh, your kids, your kids? - Three kids. - Oh, your kids, your kids. That's... That's cute, they have lives. I see it, just, wow! What? I mean, whatever happened to the woman, whose best course of action was to push through? Well, maybe it's not always best to push on through. Oh, spoken like a true leader who cares about her team. Well, don't put me on the cover of "Forbes" just yet. Okay, now I have to figure out what I'm going to do with the rest of my day, now that I have some unexpected free time. Oh, I know what you're doing with your unexpected free time. There she is. Didn't think I was gonna pull 180, did you? I, I didn't expect it at all. Come on, I have an idea. Okay. The Planetarium. Ahhuh. You didn't have to do this for me. Well, you brought me out of my comfort zone, so I thought I'd bring you back into yours. Yeah, I'll take it. I got tickets to the Sky Show. No way. Let's do it. As we travel beyond our solar system into deep space, a celestial event of stars colliding creates two possible outcomes, a destructive collision of a supernova or the creation of a new brighter star. Thank you. - Hi. - Hello. Do you work here? Oh, no, I don't, but I'm here so often, I might as well. I'm looking for a gift for my granddaughter, got any suggestions? Ah, "Maze Craze" is a good one. What's that you're playing? That's a new game created by a friend of mine and well, she wanted me to be a Guinea pig and try it out. Would you believe a pet Guinea pig is the present my granddaughter begged me for? Well, I would stick to board games, 'cause they're cleaner and quieter. "Love Life?" Yeah, it's all about finding a love match. Sounds exciting, though I'm not the target audience, my romance days are long gone. Well, mine are too, but I, I could use a partner for the game and I was wondering if, well, would you like to try it out? I kinda like the idea that two different stars can collide and make something so different and beautiful. From destruction to creation. Hm, you know, when I was a little girl, I used to think I could see the man in the moon from my bedroom window. How did the man in the moon cut his hair? Oh, is this an astronomy joke? Eclipsed it. I'll save the rest of the jokes in my arsenal for another time. Okay. You're a true gentleman. Here, take a look. Take a look, you can see the man in the moon a little bit better than your bedroom window. Oh. Nope, I can't see anything. Okay, all right, well, hold on. All right, how about now? Oh, okay. Mm-hm. Oh, wow! Mm-hm. That's been in front of me the whole time? All you had to do was look. All I had to do was look. Oh. It's Susie, it's gotta be important if it's at this time. Hello. Hi, Audrey, I'm here with Senior Board Member, Nick. Hi, hi, Audrey. And so sorry to call you so late, but we have some urgent news. - Yeah. - Is this about "Love Life?" I'm actually here with Matthew right now, I'm just gonna put you on speakerphone. - Oh, good. - Hey, Susie. Well, we can tell you both together then. So Audrey, on behalf of the Board, we are pulling the game. What? Why? I don't understand. I'm as surprised as you are. Well, we heard about the testing session and how can I tell you this? There's just no time to right the ship. The ship is right now, the game is completely different. I know, I tried to smooth things over, but- - You did. - I did. You really tried to smooth things over. I did try, but we hate to tell you, it really is out of our hands. Well, what are we supposed to do now? I'm sorry. Yeah, sorry, guys. I'll talk to you later, bye. Why would they do something like that? I don't know. Oh, this is all my fault. Come on. Audrey, you can't blame yourself, let's not do that. Oh, I can, I was put in charge of this, okay and look what happened. What happened was you created an amazing game, assembled an amazing team. The layout wasn't ready. - No. - It needed more work. The test was rushed, none of this would've happened, if I would've just stuck to my process. - Of doing it alone? - Yes. But no, Matthew, you had to convince me to make this a group effort. Do you know what happens when too many people are involved? Nothing gets done! You can't control everything, Audrey. Listen, I know that, we had, I don't know what we had. You know what we had, don't do that. Please don't push me away, don't minimize this. We can talk about it, just let me be here for you please. I'm sorry, I think you may think I'm someone that I'm not and I just, I can't, I'm, it's a lot. - Just take a- - I just need to be alone. Hey, Audrey. - Oh, hi. - Hi. - Hi, Patty. - Hi. I had some questions about what you want for the ending of the game. Oh. Ah, you didn't hear? Um, yeah, the game got canceled. What? No, that can't be true, it's, it's so good. Well, tell that to the Board of Directors. Oh, this must be why they called an emergency meeting this afternoon, I'm so sorry. It's okay, you know, it gives me a chance to sort of, um, work on my own ideas, so. Well, if you want a sounding board for those, I'd be happy to help. Thanks, Patty, I think I'm just gonna, I'm gonna do this one on my own. Thank you. I'll, I'll leave. Oh, thank you, Evie, but you know, it really doesn't matter anymore. Oh, it matters, Auds, because the game really works. What do you mean? Well, I played it with a man I met at the Boardwalk Cafe, turns out we have a lot in common and we have a date later this week. A date? â™ª A date â™ª What? Evie? Yeah and so it seems I'm, you know, not ready to give up all my cards yet. No, oh, I'm happy for you, that's so great. Oh, thank you. Oh, Auds, the game has gotta be out there, so you shouldn't let it go in a single burst of glory. You hear me? Oh and Auds, and you shouldn't fold all your cards either. Bye. Bye. Thank you, Evie. "If you ever wondered, two stars colliding is nothing but a bust." He's FreeHugz. Oh, oh. Ah, okay. Pick up, pick up, pick up. Oh, ah! Oh! Oh! It's me. I wanted to say that I'm sorry, I push people away, I do. It's just because I'm afraid that they're gonna leave anyway and I'll be disappointed and alone and the truth is, I already am, so, Um... I'm sorry. Listen to this, ah, you're FreeHugz. That's just- The mailbox is full and cannot accept any messages at this time. Oh. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no! Why? I can't believe the game's kaput. I guess everything goes back to the way it used to be. Yeah. Guys, I need your help. Oh, it's just so many stairs. What are the chances that you can make four more prototypes of this in less than two hours? Oh my, I mean, it's possible. What's happening? Well, sort of like a last minute, you know, Hail Mary idea to save the game. Save the game, what's all this? Susie, can you convince the Board members to take the meeting offsite? Where did you have in mind? I have an idea. "I still believe two stars can create something beautiful together. Come to Boardwalk Games and find out." This is "Love Life," the game of love, where players initially explore flirtation and then it evolves into discovering the deeper meaning of love. The game challenges the players to let down their guard and discover true, genuine connection. Well, they certainly seem to be enjoying themselves. - Yeah. - But how did you manage to pull all this together so quickly? I have moved through life mostly as a solo player and one thing this experience has taught me is it's much more rewarding to have a team and I have the greatest team, so thank you. Have you have heard from Matthew? Matthew didn't resign his contract. Oh. Unfortunately we did not see all this. Yeah, no. I'm sure he would be very proud. Yeah. - You okay? - Oh yeah, I was just, um, I was just hoping that he would be here. So I'm curious, when the couples reach the middle, is that it? The game finished? No. The game has more meaning than that. When couples play, they go from initial attraction to. Curiosity, then interest. As couples become more enlightened, they move towards something that they never knew they needed, but always secretly longed for. They see when they find themselves in the middle, they realize that there's a big move, a grand gesture, something uniquely personal. Something that represents the beginning and hopefully not the end. And at that moment, they realize the game's path has been bringing them together all along and now they come together as one. - Oh. - Mm-hm. You came. I'm not one to disappoint. So have you figured out the grand gesture? Have I ever? Aw! Wow, I think the game works. It looks like you and your team have got yourselves a game! Teamwork makes dream work. Yay! No rush in, you know, finalizing the details on... Okay, Tabletop Awards can wait another year. Of course. Congratulations, you did it. We did it. I guess it turns out we're a match, huh?
