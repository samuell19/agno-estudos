Woman's voice: 9-1-1. What's your emergency? Man: Help me! Somebody help me. My wife has fallen down the stairs. - Where are you, sir? - I'm at 748 Grace Street - Is she breathing, sir? - No! I want you to give her CPR. I can help you. I already tried. I'm a doctor. I need an ambulance. One is on the way, sir. Please... Please... Are those...? Yep. I'm almost a divorced woman. Wow. I'm sorry, honey. I really thought I'd be married forever. Well, whose fault's that? Certainly not yours. I know. I just feel like I failed somehow, especially with Emma. You're the best mom I know. And you're a mom who deserves a fresh start. Massages and facials are booked. We are going to relax and have a great time. I do need this. Mm. Hey, Em. Hey. Hey. We're only gonna be gone for one night. That's not what I'm upset about. Mom, I'm sixteen. I can stay here by myself! I know you can stay here by yourself. That's not the point. We talked about this. Your father and I think this is a good chance for you two to reconnect. Good luck with that. He's really trying, honey. Remember how close you two were? Speak of the... Emma, Dad's here! How are you? I've been better. I got the papers. Me too. Did you sign them? Not yet. Why not? You know I don't want this. This... is because of you. I know. And I've changed. How many times have I heard that? Got my first chip. Thirty days sober. And I'm about to land a new job doing the books for a small family trucking company. I'm happy for you, but that doesn't change things for us. I know. Have fun and I'll see you tomorrow night. Love you. Love you. Thanks so much. Whoops! Oh, my gosh! I'm sorry. You OK? Yeah. I'm a doctor, if you need medical attention. I think I'm OK. Well, enjoy your stay. The hiking's really nice around here. Thanks. To desk clerk: Hi. I lost my key. He is so cute. It's a little too soon, Thea, like a year too soon for me to start dating again. OK. But nothing wrong with just like, a little bit of window shopping. Really? OK. Calm down. I got it. I got it. It's nice to see you relaxing. You work too much. That's why I hired you. You're one of the best designers I know, Thea. Hey, I forgot to ask you. How did things go with Austin back at the house? Between you and me, I'm not sure he's gonna sign the papers. But after everything that happened... the drinking, the affair... He's not ready to let go. But I told him it's not happening. Good. You deserve someone solid. How's your man doing? He told me he's still in love with his wife. Wait! He's married? Did you know? No! Of course not. I was totally blindsided. You don't need that jerk. Listen, you're gorgeous. There's tons of great guys out there. You'll find the perfect fit. I hope so. I know I'm right. That dinner was amazing. Just wait until dessert. Surprise! Oh, my God! You guys! It's your divorce party. My what party? A divorce party. That's what they're calling it these days. Seriously, this is really weird. Well, it's all the rage now and this is your independence. You should embrace it! You guys are too much. Let's break out the champagne! Woo! Oh! Cheers. Ava: Cake time! You've got to be kidding me. Oh, don't worry. He deserved it. Hmm. Here's to ex-husbands. For better or worse. Nice. I got a noise complaint coming from this room. I'm sorry, Officer. We'll keep it down. I'm gonna have to write you up. For this? I'm afraid so. You know, we take rowdy guests very serious around here. Oh, no. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Yeah! Oh, no. No, no, no. Oh, yeah! Woo-hoo! Take it off! Take it off, baby! Brittany Conrad, today's your lucky day. I, uh, I'm sorry. I can't, I can't do this. I, uh, I'm gonna be over here. You guys have fun. Man: Twice in two days. That's worthy of a proper introduction, don't you think? Right, from the front desk. I'm Jake, Jake Rich Brittany. Nice to meet you, Brittany. Oh, I, I'm not, uh... I guess I can take it to my table, uh, unless you want some company? Uh, sure. So I thought I was the only one that got up early around here. My friends are passed out upstairs. Long night. Ah, sounds like fun. Debateable. They threw me a party... a divorce party. Who celebrates a divorce? I'm glad I'm not the only one who thinks that's crazy. So I take it it was a surprise then? Complete with an adult entertainer with his own badge. Oh, ho ho ho! So what are you doing at the resort? Ah, I'm at a medical conference board meeting. We do it every year. You didn't bring your wife? Oh, yeah. I, uh... I haven't been able to take it off. My wife died a year ago. I'm so sorry. Yeah. She, uh, fell down the stairs at our house. I, I tried to save her, but I couldn't; it was too late. How awful! Yeah. Sometimes life can be pretty cruel. Uh, I, I'm so sorry. I, I don't mean to bring you down with this. We just met. That's fine. I'm a good listener. You know, this may be a little too forward but, uh, any chance you'd like to go for a hike this morning? Actually... yeah. Sounds like fun. Perfect. Ava: Brittany... I know we talked about this already, but I am so sorry. Celebrating a divorce just felt backwards. When I got my divorce, I buried myself in ice cream and I cried for weeks. I know. I was there, remember? Hey. Hey, where ya going? Hiking. With who? The doctor I met when we checked in. I ran into him at breakfast. Oh, that guy? He is so cute. Slow down. Brittany: It's just a hike, Ava. You know, Austin's been doing really good at our meetings. He's only been sober a month. And remember it had only been a month for me too. And now, it's been five years. I just think you two should hit pause on this divorce. Ava, you know I always appreciate your advice. Now, if I'm not back in half an hour, call the FBI. Brittany: It's so beautiful out here! Jake: Yeah. I love the country air. So, uh, you smell gardenias? That's my perfume. Funny. Those were my mother's favorite flowers. Mine too. No surprise there. So what hospital do you work at? Resurrection Memorial Hospital. That's where I had my daughter. It's right near my house. You have a daughter? Yeah. She's sixteen going on twenty-six. She actually wants to be a doctor. Oh, that's great. How's she dealing with the divorce? Not well. She blames her dad. He's working on his demons. I'm sorry. I just need him to sign the divorce papers so I can focus on Emma and work and not stress anymore. What do you do? I'm an interior designer, mostly high-end homes and restaurants in Philly. Well, I hope you have time for fun too. Not a whole lot lately. I like to run every day and, sadly, going to my morning coffee place is my big outing these days. Where do you go? Joe's Ground Coffee. Oh, that place makes the best whipped coffee. You know it? Yeah. It's right near the hospital. Hey, Brittany, would you like to go get coffee some time back home? Oh, I appreciate the offer... but I'm not in a place to date right now. Totally understand. I haven't been able to go on a date since my wife died. It's hard. Wanna keep going? Yeah. Brittany: The resort was nice but it's good to be home. How'd it go with Dad? It went. Emma, you've only got one dad. He hurt us, Mom... bad. Did he tell you he got a sobriety chip? Yeah. Be lucky if that lasts a week. I'm going to my room. Not before you clear your plate. Jake! We have to stop running into each other like this. Ah, that's right. You said you come here. Can't start my day without my java jolt. Coffee for two? It's for my friend. We're doing the finishing touches on her new restaurant. Nice. Look, Brittany, I know you said you weren't ready, but... would I be out of line if I asked you out again? I'm sorry, Jake. You can't blame a guy for trying, right? You're very kind. And no, you can't. I'll see you around. Thea! I didn't know you were coming. I would've grabbed you a coffee. Oh, no worries. I'll see you at the restaurant. OK. Help! Help! Somebody! You OK? What are you doing here? Uh... Emma called me. She said you might need a ride back home. The police insisted I come in an ambulance. They said it was just a precaution. The police? I thought you fell running. I didn't wanna say anything to Emma, but someone attacked me. What? They stole the diamond necklace you gave me. What do the police say? They took a statement, but I didn't get a look at the person. Hi. Jake. I mean, Doctor... I'll be in the waiting room. Your ex? Yeah. I'm confused. You're a surgeon. Ortho. The attending doctor asked me to check out your wrist. For surgery? Ah, not necessary. Looks like it's just a sprain. So, I heard you had quite a scare. Yeah. I swear I saw my life flash before my eyes. I'm just glad you're OK. I'd like you to come and see me in a few days, make sure everything's healing well. OK. Austin: How do you know that doctor? I met him at the resort we went to. That's weird. No, it isn't. I was injured. He works at the hospital. Hello? We're home. Mom. I'm all right, sweetie. Thanks, Thea. Oh, of course. Uh, I'm gonna sleep on the couch tonight. That's not necessary, Austin. I don't mind. You don't live here anymore. What did you wanna talk to me about, by the way? I think we should wait to file the papers. It was a big decision that we made when I wasn't well. Austin, you're stalling. Thanks for the ride. All right. Brittany? I love you. Come in. Hi. Brittany, have a seat. How are you feeling? Pretty good. Still in a little pain. Hm. OK if I take a look? Of course. Hm. Looks good. The pain you're feeling is normal and should subside soon. Then you can lose this. Thanks. Is that it? That's it. Easiest patient ever. Thanks for making me feel better the other day. I was just doing my job. You have good bedside manner. That comes from my wife. She always reminded me that patients were more than paychecks. She taught me how to cook too. She sounded really special. You know, my friend's having a soft opening tonight at her new restaurant. Would you have any interest in some good food, as friends? I'd love that. Great. I'll send you the details. Perfect. Ava: Any news on who attacked you? Three days and nothing. The neighborhood security cameras were no help either. Ava: That's too bad. How's your wrist? The surgeon says it looks good. Surgeon? Yeah. It's the doctor I met at the resort. What? You didn't tell me that. He was on call the night I went to the hospital. If you don't go out with him, I will. That guy is the whole package. She's not going out with him. Actually, uh, I invited him to the soft opening tonight. How's Austin gonna feel about that? It's not like I'm cheating on him. We are getting a divorce. Point taken. I was gonna invite him, but I won't. Thank you, Ava. Well, I'm happy for you. I think you and the doctor will have a really fun time. Brittany Conrad, hello. Oh, uh, yeah. It's in my car. Don't you think you should lay off the Brittany dating thing? Wow. You really don't want her to be happy, do you? Excuse me? Seems to me like you want her to never leave the misery-loves-company club and stay there with you. Why do you keep pushing Austin on her? I'm not, but he's trying to redeem himself. He's a good friend. Hm. Is that so? So why did you get him in trouble then? You know about that? Oh, I know a whole lot more than you think. Excuse me. I have to go check on the kitchen. Hi, Dr. Rich. Hi. The usual? You know me so well, Janet. I've got them ready right here for you. I'll put them on your account. Thanks. Seriously? This food is great. Ava's amazing, isn't she? Hey, you two. So, how is it? Really good, Ava. What's he doing here? Brittany: You said you weren't gonna invite him, Ava. I didn't. I'll take care of it. Excuse me. Austin, I didn't know you were coming. Brittany invited me. What's, uh, the doctor doing here? I'm sorry. I think it's best for everyone if you just go. It's all good. I just want to see your new restaurant. OK. Just for a minute, all right? Austin, come sit with me. Hey. Hi. Uh, ginger ale, please. Yeah, I'm sorry you have to see that. A shot, please. It won't last. Yeah, well, I heard things are moving really fast. She says Jake's like the whole package. Seriously? Mm-hm. Here. This'll take the edge off. I can't. It's one drink. Loosen up. I'm stuffed. What a great meal. What is he still doing here? That bastard's not gonna steal Brittany from me. Your doctor? Real nice, Brit. You've been drinking. You couldn't help yourself, could you? You had to rub it in my face? What are you talking about? You invited me here! No, I didn't. Leave her alone, man. Don't touch me. Austin! What are you doing? You mind your own business. I'm trying to talk to my wife! Come on, let's go, Austin. She's right. You should leave. Sure... after I tell you one thing. Thea and I have been sleeping together behind your back for months! He's the married guy you were seeing? Ava: Are you kidding? I'm outta here. Thea: I'll call you a car. I can drive myself. You walk out this door and I'm calling the cops again. You wouldn't dare. Watch me. Don't do this! Well, it didn't take long for Austin to get arrested again. I feel partly responsible. Seeing us together was obviously a trigger. Jake: Hey, it's not your fault. Alcoholism is tough. I watched my mother deal with my alcoholic father long enough to understand how you feel. I'm worried he's gonna go to jail this time. I hate to say it but, for a second offense, probably. I know. That woman he was with...? Sleeping with? That's Thea. She works for me. I thought she was my friend. You gonna cut ties with her? I have to. I mean, Austin and I were broken up but it's sneaking around behind my back that's unforgiveable... by both of them. Thanks for being so understanding about tonight. I'd be running for the hills if I were you. Nah, no running here. Maybe just a slow walk. Coffee tomorrow morning? Yeah. I'd like that. OK. Goodnight! Austin was doing so well. How could he blow his sobriety? Hey, I'm confused about something. I thought you didn't want Austin here at the restaurant tonight. I didn't! He said you invited him. I don't know where that came from. Hey, you're not mad at me, are you? Of course not, honey. You had to do it. OK. Thea left me a message. She's gonna bail Austin out tomorrow at his first appearance. I'm kinda surprised. Ah, she seems to only care about herself. I never trusted that girl. You know, she accused me of wanting you to be unhappy? Are you serious? Ah, it doesn't matter. Everything's gonna be fine. OK? We're gonna get through this like we always do. Thanks for having my back, Ava. Oh, you're my best friend. Don't forget that, OK? Let's get outta here. Yeah. OK. I'm home! Brittany: Am I late? Nah. No, no. No worries. Uh, one sugar? Please. How are you feeling? Uh, a little sore, but I'll be fine. I still feel so terrible. Hey, don't. This may be a blessing in disguise and Austin may finally sign your divorce papers. I doubt it. Ava's really gotten to his head the last couple of months. What do you mean? She's been nudging us not to give up on each other and Austin listens to her, despite everything they've been through. Really? Well, I would imagine she'd feel differently after last night. Ava only wants the best for me. It's just hard for her because she's known Austin and me since high school. But she knows deep down he's a good man. OK, on a lighter note... any chance you wanna try dinner again, uninterrupted? Tonight work? Well, it's the least I could do. Great. Hey, Ava. Oh, Thea. You scared me! How did you get in here? I still have a key. I'll take that, please. I was hoping Brittany might be around. Do you realize what you've done, the damage you have caused? Just let me explain. No. I don't wanna talk to you. Brittany doesn't wanna talk to you. You only care about yourself. Will you at least tell her that I stopped by? No. She doesn't wanna have anything to do with you. You know what? You are a pathetic, divorced drunk. Just watch your back, Ava. Brittany: I still can't believe she threatened you. I would stay far away from that girl if I were you. She keeps calling. I've been putting off firing her. You need to do it! I know. I know. Speaking of tough calls, did you talk to Austin yet? I did. He actually apologized to me. Wow. I'm impressed. Yeah. He feels absolutely terrible about what he did. I think this could be his rock bottom, Brit. I hope so. I know Austin and I really need a good talk, but I just told him I needed some time. So, how did it go with Jake this morning? Good. We're supposed to have dinner tonight. Mm. Is this the right time, with everything that happened? I'm a little torn. But sometimes it's just easier to talk to a stranger than it is your own friends and family. I am so sorry, Ava. You know I didn't mean it like that. I value your advice. It's just... Say no more. I've been there. OK, you just have to trust your gut. You know what? I think I'm gonna cancel. You were right about not rushing into something. And my head's not in the right place. I should call him now, get it over with. Yeah. Dr. Rich. Hi, Jake. It's Brittany. Brittany! I have a restaurant picked out for tonight. Do you like Thai? About that, I'm not gonna be able to make it. There's just too much going on right now. I'm sorry. Well, what changed? Anything you wanna talk about? You're sweet. Ava, wait up! Is this because of Ava? Uh, Jake, sorry. I gotta go. Talk soon. Get a hold of yourself. Oh, shoot! Another thing to fix. I've gotta get out of here. It's a shame you couldn't see it, Ava, but I'm the right man for her. Angry enough to kill? Sorry, Austin. Austin, I'm going for a run. Can we talk later? It can't wait. What is it? It's Ava. What about her? She's dead! What? No! She was murdered last night at the restaurant. Jake: Wait till she finds out you're the one who killed her, Austin. Do they know who did it? Not that I've heard. But apparently money was taken. Might have been a robbery. I can't believe this. Let's go inside. No! You should sit down at least. No. I need to think. This is all too much. Brittany, wait! Brittany? Brittany, are you OK? Brittany, what's wrong? Talk to me. It's Ava. She's dead! What? She was killed in her restaurant last night. Oh, my God. I'm so sorry. Who could do that? I don't know. First, you're attacked, then Ava. Something's wrong here. What do you mean? Well, Austin's not in a good place with you right now, and he was angry with Ava. You need to be careful around him. Uh, no. He would never hurt us. Brittany Conrad. Yes, I know. OK. Yeah. Who was that? It was a detective. She wants to talk to me about Ava. I, I have to go. Do you want me to come with you for support? I'll be fine. You should tell the detective about your attack. I need to go. I'll see you around, Jake. Oh, you will, Brittany. And I'm not wrong about Austin. Just you wait. Kathy: I'm sorry for your loss. Thanks. Can you think of anyone who might have had it out for Ava? Well, there's her ex. They had a contentious divorce, but that was years ago. He moved to Connecticut. Can you think of anyone else? Wasn't money stolen? Isn't this just random? I can't reveal details of the investigation... but we're looking at everything. Well, I did have an employee, Thea Robertson. She threatened Ava the other night. Really? Why? I found out Thea was sleeping with my husband. Ava told her to leave us alone. But I don't think she's a killer. Why's that? She just doesn't seem capable. Speaking of your ex-husband, one of the workers at Ava's bistro said she kicked him out. Austin was just upset because I was out on a date that night. He wouldn't do anything to her. He has a temper though? Ava called the police on him, a second time from what I understand. Did he know it was her? Yes, but she said he understood. That's very big of him to forgive her that quickly. Seems like it could be a possible motive. There is one more thing. I was attacked near my house this week. It might be totally unrelated, but I thought I should mention it. Did you tell the police? Yes. There's a report. They haven't found the person though. I'll look into it. Any updates? Ava Kennedy was scheduled to have her security cameras installed at the restaurant today. Damn. But there was a security camera across the street. Austin Conrad went to Ava's Bistro around the time of the murder. Take a look. Hm. Jared: Something else. I got the password to the victim's phone. She sent Austin Conrad a text before the murder. Kathy reading: I know you're still really angry with me and I'm sorry, but I had no choice turning you in. Please come by the restaurant right now so we can talk. Strange. The wife said he wasn't that upset. Maybe she's covering for him. We gotta bring this guy in, try to get a confession. You know, her restaurant key was missing off her keyring. The killer probably took it. We find the key, we find the killer? My money's on Austin Conrad. I got his financials. He was in debt big time. Might explain why cash was missing from the restaurant. Oh, by the way, before I forget, we need to pull a report. Conrad's wife told me she was attacked this week. On it. Details on Ava's funeral and wake to come. In lieu of flowers, please link to Ava's favorite charity. Always happy to donate to a good cause... for another good cause. You and me, Brittany. I'll take good care of you. I still can't believe this is real. It's only been four days. Hi, Emma. Brittany, can I talk to you please? Go inside, Emma. I said all I needed to say on the phone. I just wanna make this right. Thea, don't. I know. I made a mistake. But I'm in love with Austin. That's between the two of you. But until you truly let him go, we can't be together. He still loves you. You need Jake. I saw you on your hike, and at the coffee shop. You belong together. Were you watching us? I just wanted to make sure you were really moving on. Wow. I need to go. Wait. There's something. It's important. Don't come near me or Emma again. Brittany: Jake. - Hey. I heard about the service on Ava's bereavement page. I know we didn't leave on the best note at the park, but I wanted to pay my respects. I hope that's OK. Of course. Thanks. I brought a donation for her charity. That's really nice. Thanks. I imagine it's been a hard week. The worst ever. I'm worried about you, Brittany. I'll be OK. Hey, is there any chance I could cook you dinner, you and Emma? I make a mean lasagna and I could talk to Emma about med school. When? Is tomorrow too soon? That might be nice. Will six o'clock work? I'll text you my address. Hi. This is for friends and family only. Austin! Sorry, Jake. No, no, no. He's right. I just wanted to quickly pay my respects. I'll see you tomorrow night. Tomorrow night? It's nothing. What's he doing here anyway? He was just donating to Ava's charity. There's something weird about that guy. You met two seconds ago and now he's showing up at your best friend's wake? He's a respected surgeon who just offered to talk to your daughter about med school. Can I talk to you somewhere a little more private? Sure. What's going on? The police were asking about you. I know. They came to see me. There's something you should know. I was here the night Ava died. Why didn't you tell me before? Because I never saw her. All the doors were locked. She wouldn't answer her phone. Her car was open in the parking lot so I, I checked it out. But there was nothing out of the ordinary. You think she was dead already? I do. Why did you come back here in the first place? She texted me, said we needed to talk right away, which was weird because we already had. We were good. I apologized. She told me. I'm really scared, Austin. Who did this to her? I don't know. I want you to know I'm truly sorry about what happened at the opening. I'm gonna try to go to rehab instead of jail if the judge will let me. I need help. I'm glad to hear that. I never meant to hurt you, or Thea for that matter. You know I love you, Brittany. I always have. I should... go freshen up. Austin! Austin? It's me! Austin, is that you? Austin, please open up. I need to tell you something. It's really important. Wanna make fifty bucks? I'll need you to make a phone call. Hunter! A tip came in on the night shift about the Ava Kennedy murder. Oh, yeah? Caller says we need to check out Austin Conrad's house. Any idea who called? Woman, but it was a burner. You got enough for a warrant? I think we have enough now. Let's get on it. Austin Conrad, I have a warrant to search your house. A warrant? I told you everything I know. I'm calling my lawyer. And that is your right, but now we need to search your house. I've never seen that stuff before. Call CSI. Put on your jacket. Austin Conrad, you're under arrest for the murder of Ava Kennedy. No! No, no, no! Someone set me up! You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to an attorney. If you can't afford one, one will be provided for you. Do you understand the rights that I've just read to you? Jake: Nothing's standing in our way now, Brittany. So, what'd you think about Jake? He seemed cool. I looked him up. Did you know he's being honored for Surgeon of the Year at Resurrection Memorial Hospital? Wow! He didn't mention it. And... he's treated five basketball MVPs and ten professional baseball players. I guess this means you're OK with him coming over for dinner? Yeah. It's cool, I guess. He could really help you. I bet he's got a lot of connections. Hey! Welcome! These are for you. Gardenias. You remembered. So we're about to do our first cadaver dissection. And I pulled the sheet off and, get this, the body starts twitching and convulsing. Seriously? And then the body sits up and yells, "I'm not dead!" Ah! I, I screamed and knocked my tray of instruments over! Who was on the table? Another student. I almost dropped out of med school right then and there. Good thing you didn't. Ah. Graduated top of my class. What's this I hear about you being honored for Surgeon of the Year? You know about that? Emma told me. Yeah, it's no big deal. You're so modest. I'm worried that my grades won't be good enough to get into med school. They'll come with hard work. In fact, I'm gonna give you my first medical textbook. It brought me a lot of luck. Really? Um-hm. Thanks. Emma, why don't you grab dessert? That was so nice. Thank you. Of course. She's a great kid. Yes, she is. So tell me, where'd you grow up, Jake? Princeton, New Jersey. I went to school there too. And afterwards, I landed a residency in the area. You said your mom raised you by herself? Yeah, yeah. She left my father when I was young. Ah, she was working hard and trying to be a mother and a father at the same time. I tried to help her as much as I could but there's only so much an eight-year-old can do. She passed just before I ended my residency. I'm so sorry. She would've been so proud of you. Actually, you remind me a lot of her: smart, strong, driven. Beautiful. Oh, uh, excuse me for a second. Thea? I thought I told you... Brittany, it's Austin. He's been arrested for Ava's murder. Oh, my God! He tried to reach you and, when you didn't answer, he called me. Does he have an attorney? Yeah. I was able to get in touch with the guy representing him for the DUI. He said the police phoned and they found evidence in Austin's bedroom. Evidence? Everything OK? We need to cut tonight short. What is it? Brittany, I know that Austin's been framed. I saw someone leaving his house last night. You have to tell the police! Austin was framed? Emma: For what? Mom? Ava's murder. What? No! It's gonna be OK! We're gonna figure it out! He wants me to stop by and see if I can find anything that might help him. He said I could ask you for the house key. Uh, sure. Just let me find it. You said you saw someone leaving his house? Did you get a good look? No. It was too dark. I did see his car though. It's very nice. Same one you drive, actually. Here. Be careful. Thank you. Emma locked herself in her room. She's had her problems with her dad, but she loves him. Well, she's just absorbing everything. Give her time. Austin would never do this. I have to help him. I'm worried about you, Brittany. This is getting scary with him. Austin's got a good heart. He's not a killer, if that's what you're getting at. Ah, that's totally possible, but we need to find out more information before jumping to conclusions. Look, I'm, I'm sorry, but I need to cut tonight short. You understand? Oh, course. For what it's worth, I had a really nice time tonight. Me too. Hm. I care about you, Brittany, a lot. I'm here for you. Thanks, Jake. Hello, Thea! What are you doing here? You think you're so smart. I was just coming by to pick up a few things. Yeah. See, here's the problem: that was me here last night and you're getting too close for comfort. I won't say anything. I promise you will never see me again. Yeah. That's not gonna work for me. But here's what I'm gonna do... You're gonna write down how devastated you are after Austin dumped you for his wife, and how he killed Ava after she destroyed his life after she called the police. No. Please, no. You just couldn't live without him. I'm not gonna do it. Do it! Start writing or else I'm going to make you suffer. Yes. Good girl. So I'll get all the bail money back once this is over? That's right, as long as Austin shows up for all his court appearances. What's the next step from here? Well, they've got some pretty strong evidence. I'll put my top investigator on it and see what he can dig up. But I gotta be honest, this is gonna be an uphill battle. Oh, you're not gonna believe this. What now? Thea Robertson is dead. What? How? Well, it looks like a suicide. The landlord went over to fix a leaky faucet at Austin Conrad's place, and he found her in the tub with her wrists slit. Well, we know it wasn't Conrad. He was here in jail all night. In Thea's suicide note, she says that he killed Ava. Sounds like case closed to me then. Do you know what they found at Austin's? A key, some money, and your diamond necklace. No, no, Brittany! I didn't attack you. You know I was framed, probably by Thea! The police need to speak to her! I should go check on Emma. Vincent Abraham. OK. OK. Thank you. I appreciate the heads up. We got a big problem. The DA's office just called. They want you back in jail. What? So if Thea's death was a suicide, why is Austin back in jail? The DA went back to the judge in light of new evidence. Thea said Austin killed Ava in her note. None of this makes any sense. Oh my God. Just when we thought things couldn't get any worse. Brittany, you've been through so much. You need to get away, even if it's just for one night. I can't. There's too much going on. Uh, I know you're trying to be strong, but it's not good for you. I know but... How about next Saturday? Where would we even go? Well, I have a quant old Victorian in the country. There's plenty of bedrooms. No strings. I just want you to relax. That does sound nice. I could bring Emma. Oh, wait. She has a volleyball sleepover. I want her to have as much normalcy in her life right now as possible. She'll be surrounded by friends. She'll be fine. Brittany, I want you to know I will be here for you every day until this is resolved. Thanks, Jake. Whoa! Are you all right? I, uh, I feel so exhausted. I-I'm not myself. That's your body telling you that you are stressed out. Let me help you upstairs. All right? Britanny: I'm so sorry about this. Thanks, Jake. Of course. Emma, you'll be the perfect stepdaughter. We'll be the perfect family. What is this doing here? Jake? What were you doing in there? Well, your, your mother was tired, so I brought her up. It's still pretty early. My mom can barely fall asleep at midnight. Hm. She's had a rough go with your dad, like you. I love my dad. Of course you do. You should know, uh, your mother and I are going away next Saturday. It'll do her good. Where? My place in the country, I'm gonna take her to Green Hill, the most popular farm-to-table restaurant in Pennsylvania. It's too bad you're on a sleepover. How do you know that? Your mother tells me everything. I, I think you should go now. I was just on my way out. I brought the medical textbook for you. It's in the kitchen. Surgeon's wife dead after fall at home. You OK? Yeah. I've just been really tired lately. Did you know that Jake was in your room last night? He helped me up there. And he said you two are going away together? I just thought it would be nice to get away from everything. You mean from Dad being held on murder charges? Are you seriously in denial? Of course not! Look, Emma. I didn't fall running. I was attacked the night I hurt my wrist. My diamond necklace was stolen, and they found it at your father's house. What? Why didn't you tell me? I didn't wanna scare you. But Dad would never do anything to hurt you or Ava. You're right. This isn't him. So what about Jake? Did you know that his wife died falling down the stairs? Yes. He told me. It was a horrible tragedy. Jake's a good man. He helps people. They trust him. Please don't worry, honey. You make me feel like shakin' Shakin' a bottle of soda... You realy got me breakin' Breakin' all my walls down Hello? Emma? It's Dad. Dad? Are you OK? Yeah. I'm, I'm hanging in there. Listen. I want you to know that I didn't do this. I know. I'm sorry for how I've acted. I believe you and I know you're trying to do better. I love you so much. Me too. We've gotta get you outta there. We will. How's your mom? She's going away with the doctor tomorrow. I'm really not feeling him. Has something happened? I got bad vibes and so I looked into it. I found out his wife fell down the stairs and died. Really? Yeah. It's creepy. I found her best friend's page. She's in Princeton. I was thinking about going to see her. Honey, uh, that doesn't sound like a good idea. I don't think we have another choice. Wow. It looks so peaceful. Was I right about getting away? Yeah. Hi. Are you looking for anything in particular? Uh... No, not really. Uh, is, is Sherra here? Um, that's, that's me. Do I know you? I just want to talk to you about Lillian Rich. Uh... What, what about Lillian? You two were besties, right? C-can I ask you about her husband Jake? Uh, I really don't feel comfortable talking about him. It's just that he's dating my mom and I just think there's something seriously wrong with him. Please? Let's talk in private. I'll be back in ten. Come. This is it. It's gorgeous! Wow! I'm so sorry that happened to you. So, um, what do you know about Jake? Well, the police ruled Lillian's death an accident, but I never believed it. Why? Because she was about to leave Jake, and nobody leaves him. He became super controlling. He made her quit her job as a teacher. They wouldn't go out unless it suited him. She was, she was basically a prisoner. Seriously? People treat him like he's God but he's, he's evil. Will this room be OK? Actually... I think I might stay with you... if that's OK. After you, Madame. Emma: Do you know anything about Jake's country house? Um, yeah, actually. Lillian's engagement party was there. He said that his mother left it to him in her will. Do you know where it is? Um... Uh, somewhere remote. Oh! The Poconos. Do you know where exactly? Oh, God, no. I, I don't remember. OK. Thank you so much. Please, just be careful. If Jake finds out you're looking into him, it's... Oh, you're unpacking my stuff. Oh, I hope that's OK. Just trying to take care of you as promised. I have dinner reservations for us at an amazing restaurant, and I see you brought the perfect dress for the occasion. Uh, if there's time before dinner, I'd love to take a quick bath in that old tub to warm up. Of course. Great. Oh, there's no cell service? Oh, not out here in the country. And I purposely don't have internet so I can unwind. Is there a landline I can use to check on Emma? A repairman's supposed to be coming tomorrow. Uh, the wires went down in the last storm. We're always the last to get help. But you can call once you get into town. Uh, sure. Hi. You've reached Brittany Conrad. I'm away from... Gotta find you, Mom. No unwanted distractions for our big night, Brittany. It's just you and me. Where is everyone? I rented it out just for us. What? This is so extravagant! You're worth it. Dr. Rich, welcome. Thank you, Brad. This is Brittany, the woman I told you about. Hi. Ah, hello, Brittany. You're in for a treat tonight. And, might I say, good company with the doctor. Be right back with the wine list. Hi. You've reached Brittany Conrad... Come on, Mom! Answer the phone! Thank you. Oh! I need to call Emma. That's weird. I can't find my phone. You must have left it at the house. Maybe. Can I borrow yours? I'll just send Em a quick text to see if she needs me. Of course. Well? She says she's having fun. Apparently, she doesn't need her mom anymore. Hey. She'll always need you. Wow. How's dinner? Delicious. You were right about this place. You are so beautiful. You know that? Thank you, Jake. Everything about you is effortless, elegant. Austin didn't know how good he had it. Let's not talk about him tonight. I just don't understand how someone could have a prize like you and throw it away. Prize? You're what every man dreams about, Brittany. Hello? Anyone home? Where did they go? What is this? Come on! Where did they go! I'm gonna take her to Green Hill, the most popular farm-to-table restaurant in Pennsylvania. Green Hill! We'd like to be alone now. Thank you. Brittany? There was something about you... from the first time I laid eyes on you. That was funny. I ran right into you. No, no, no. It was more than that. It was a life-changing moment. You're sweet. I have something I wanna ask you. I love you, Brittany, and I know that you're the only woman for me. Jake... I can't. Of course you can. No, I can't. Why? I care about you. But I don't know if I'll ever get married again. My divorce isn't even final yet. That's not what I wanted to hear, Brittany. It's way too soon! We barely know each other. Of course we know each other. I know everything about you. Uh, I'm sorry if I gave you the wrong impression, but I don't move this fast... ever. But when you know, you know, Brittany. We should go. No! No, not, not until we talk about this. There's nothing to talk about. Mom! Emma! What are you doing here, Emma? Mom, there's something wrong with him, like really wrong. We need to leave now. Emma, your mother and I are in the middle of a conversation. Now is not the time. We were done talking. Mom, he has a shrine to his dead mother in his house! I can't believe you snooped in my house! I love my mother. What's wrong with that? It was all kinds of flowers and candles and pictures! Yes, yes. It's a tribute to my mother! Mom, I think he killed his wife because she was gonna leave him. What? Is this true? No! That's all lies! Who, who told you that? I talked to one of your wife's friends. She never believed that Lillian's death was an accident. Whoever told you that has no idea what they're talking about. Oh, I think she does. She told me everything, about how you forced Lillian to quit her job and how you wanted her to be just like your mother! I admired my mother. Sounds to me like a crazy obsession with a dead woman. You! You do not talk about my mother! Emma, we're leaving. No, you're not going anywhere. Or what? Or you'll kill us, like you killed Lillian? You have no idea what happened there. I did everything for her. She became ungrateful, disrespectful! She deserved it! She was nothing like Mother. Nothing like you, Brittany. 9-1-1 What's your emergency? Poor Lillian. She brought this on herself. So you did kill your wife. Oh, my God. Brittany! Brittany! I love you. You have to believe me! Emma, let's go. Jake, no! Let her go! I can't do that, Brittany, now that this is all out in the open. My God, you're insane! I never did anything to you! What is it with all you ungrateful women? I treat you like gold and you all end up leaving me. Mom! Please! She's just sixteen! Let her go! I'm sorry, Brittany. I'm sorry. I loved you, Brittany. Congratulations on seeing rehab through, Austin. Who would've thought? Three months sober. I'm proud of you, Dad. If there's one thing I learned... it's how much this family means to me. And I have something to say. I know you signed the divorce papers... but I withdrew the petition. You did? The judge hadn't signed it yet. It doesn't mean we're getting back together but it does mean I'd like to take things slow and see where they go. Understood. I'm not going anywhere. Captions by sas harris
