I am not who I appear to you or to myself I am who I choose to appear to be Ruyi Troupe Master, Ruyi Troupe is here. Show them in. Are you the troupe leader, Miss Chan? That's right. I apologise for being late. The winding terrain makes for slow travelling. It's not a problem at all. This way, please. Magnificent place you have here. Our master modelled it after the theatre in Huguang Guild Hall in the capital. There is no other theatre like ours in all of Guangdong. Our patrons are officials and wealthy traders. The common folk are not allowed past the threshold. What about bandits? They wouldn't come near here. This area might seem isolated but there's a Green Standard Army camp just ten kilometres away. No bandits in their right minds would dare trifle with us. You can rest assured that this place is safe and secure. Ten kilometres? Very reassuring indeed. Where's your master? This way, please. Who are you? Chor Jiu-wan. Looks like it's going to rain. Let's seek shelter. If you hadn't gotten the runs we'd have reached the provincial capital. At this rate, we're going to be delayed another night. How about this? I'll play host and bring you to a famous inn when we reach the provincial capital. We do deserve a good meal. We've been on the road for days. Staying up half the nights to stand guard over him. I guess the Heavens have decided to keep me alive for another day. Either way, you're a dead man. I'd pray for a swift end if I were you. A vile criminal like you should be burning in hell. I wonder which of us will meet his Maker first? What did you just say? Don't let him get to you. Remember what His Lordship said. "Exercise caution in all you do." There's a village ahead. We can seek shelter there. Giddy-up! It's going to rain soon. Not any rain, a storm. The rising wind forebodes the coming storm. Even Heaven's aiding us in seeking revenge. Yes, it's been a long time coming. Which play are we putting on tonight? The Empty Fort Strategy? No. It's Bloodletting Of The Bandit. Is there such a play? More Than Meets The Eye More Than Meets The Eye Pardon us. We're escorting a convict to trial. We'd like to seek shelter from the rain. Fear not. He's bound in chains. He can't hurt anyone. I'd need to check with my master. - Give me a moment. - Very well. More Than Meets The Eye Sorry to keep you waiting. My master has agreed. He who helps others helps himself. Thank you. You're most welcome. Is he coming in as well? I'm not so sure about that... He's a felon. He must stay in our sight at all times. I hope you can accommodate us just this once. All right, but please keep an eye on him. We don't want any trouble here. You'll be on your way once the rain stops? Yes, of course. This way. Move it... Have a seat, sir. This way. Chain him to the pillar. Yes, sir. Move it. Over here. So this is a theatre. That's right. As you can see, sir... our master modelled this place after the theatre in Huguang Guild Hall in the capital. There is no other theatre like ours ...in all of Guangdong. Our patrons are officials and wealthy traders. In other words it'd be near to impossible for the common folk to cross our threshold. - Come here. - Sir. Hurry up and make a pot of ginger tea. These officials are drenched. - Yes, sir. - Hurry along. That mannerless pup. Please pardon him. I don't see any patrons so why is he all made up? Sir. Please take a seat, sir. Have a seat and I'll explain. You must not know much about our profession. We're having a full-dress rehearsal. Pardon us for interrupting your rehearsal. Please don't say that. It's no interruption at all. This is a theatre after all. People come and go all the time. May I know the name of your troupe? Certainly. We're the Jiu-wan Troupe. Have some tea, sir. We're lowly constables undeserving of such grand salutations. My family name is Ngok. Just call me Brother Ngok. Will do, Constable Ngok. You must be famished from your long journey on the road. I'll send orders to have food prepared for you. That won't be necessary. We brought our own food. It's all soaked by the rain. How do we eat this? Please don't stand on ceremony with us. Sir, may I ask who this convict is? He's a notorious bandit. No wonder he's heavily chained up. Sir, may I know where you're going? I need to relieve myself. - Let me lead the way. - Thank you. I'll be right with you. This way, please. You may relieve yourself here. Here? I wouldn't want to soil the place. Fret not. Look at this heavy downpour. The rain will wash everything away. Are you joining me? No, please go ahead. Wait. That's human flesh in that pot. You're asking for a trashing, you cur! I'm warning you to mind what you say. Are you glaring at me? Well-versed in strategies and tactics. Alas I'm a tiger in barren lands... Beware. I sense something afoot. Chief, we'd be fools to underestimate these constables. Especially their leader, Ngok Lon. I could tell from the way he moves that he's a student of Dong Hai-chuan. He wields a Bagua saber. That lad is the youngest among them. He seems rather impulsive. My guess is he's new to the job. Still, he must be a skilled pugilist to be selected for this assignment. Hold the fort out there. Don't clash head-on with them. Don't worry, Chief. I know what I'm doing. My enemy's blood shall dye the streams the day I get to seek revenge. - Filthy cur, I'll... - All right. So everyone's here. Hang on. Who are you? Highly skilled, the master is. Studying scriptures under the pine trees. I sought from him the divine truth. And all he says is, "It's all around you." Excellent poem, Ox Nose. You're too kind. I'm Immortal Wong. I've trained 28 years at Qingyun Temple on Mount Wudang and I'm one of Zhang San-feng's 116th generation of disciples. It's my honour to be here. Destiny has brought us together. Why are you here instead of practising Tao in the hills? Good question, sir. Look. To unravel common folk's worries and serve the country with pride. So he's just a fortune-teller. You're wrong. That is not what I do. I'm a literomancer. I'll get rid of him, Chief. Wait. Most priests and nuns are members of the pugilistic world. We can't afford to be rash. We'll see if he's friend or foe. - Literomancy, you say? - That's right. Do a reading for me then. Sure. It'll cost you a tael of silver. Here you go. Don't crack your teeth. Haven't you seen silver before? It's genuine... Give me a word. You talk too much. My patience's wearing thin. Do a reading for me using... the word "ox" as in "Ox Nose". What would you like to divine? I want to know how this assignment will go. I see... What's wrong? Will it go well or not? Oh my, it's going to go terribly awry. Pardon my bluntness but your lives will be in danger. Explain yourself, or I'll... Calm down, sir. Please look here. Add a stroke here and the word becomes "life". The absence of this stroke indicates the absence of life. In other words... death is all that remains. You're pretty good, Ox Nose. Well said! Keep your mouth shut. There's no need to take his words seriously. That's right... Ox Nose, do a reading for me too! Chief, that priest isn't one to be sneezed at. His flippant ways belies his true intention. You're heavily chained up. I guess you must be on death row. A dying man will have no need to lie. I shall be kind and give you a free reading. Check in on our men and ask them to lie low. We'll keep an eye here. - Go on. - Yes, Chief. Give me a Chinese character. "Life". "Life"? What would you like to divine? My destiny. What crimes did you commit? Just give your reading. What's with all the questions? My reading depends on it. Very well! I live on the edge, doing anything for money. I've plundered and spilled blood. That is the truth but it's not what landed you in this state. You're going on trial for something else. Besides, you're no mastermind. You were only acting under orders. You're out of your mind! Very true. There are grains of truth in the words of the insane. Don't you think so? Give me the reading. I'll believe you if you can convince me. Very well! You've been calling me "Ox Nose" since I stepped in here. Put the radicals for "ox" and "life" together and you get the word sheng. - Which means "beast". - You! What sort of beasts? Sacrificial lambs. In other words, you're a sacrificial lamb taking the rap for someone else. Although you deserve to die for the atrocities you've committed there's no denying you're a man among men. What a shame such a fearsome outlaw should die like a bleating sacrificial lamb. And what if I reject that fate? It's never too late to mend your ways. Chief, I'll bring them some food and try to fish for information. - Be careful. - I will. Sorry to keep you waiting. - Food's here. - Let's go. You must be hungry. Here, tuck in! There's good wine too. It'd warm you right up in this cold and wet weather. Thank you, Brother Ma. We're on duty, so we can't drink. No, no... they're not drinking but I am. Wait. Who are you? When did you show up? Me? I'm with them. Do join us, Brother Ma. Oh, I shouldn't. We barely know each other. I'm sure you'll be more comfortable without my intrusive presence. Enjoy your meal. Let me know if you need anything. I'll excuse myself. Help yourselves to the food. A silver needle is only good for testing arsenic. It's useless against the more sophisticated poisons. You're constables. Surely you must know that? Shut up and just eat! All right... I'll be quiet and eat. One bite and I can tell this is the meat of the Mongolian fat-tailed sheep. Delicious! Chief, they are very wary. I can't get anything out of them. We'll watch and bide our time. As long as we don't blow our cover we will get our chance. You know what? No good man would turn his back on another man's suffering. Right? Here I am on my balcony. - Let him be. - Staring at the mountains before me... The way of Tao advocates compassion for all. I'm a follower of Tao. I've brought food for you. This is a trap! Did you poison the wine? No, the poison is still here. That filthy priest is trying to sabotage us. What's the matter? The wine has been poisoned... So it is true. Government officials are full of lies. Who are you? Simmer down, sir. She's our troupe leader. So you're Miss Chor. Pardon my lack of manners. Don't say that. I'm Chor Jiu-wan. Why did you poison the wine? Why would you think the wine's poisoned? Why else would he be rolling on the ground, clutching at his throat? Don't worry. If the wine is indeed poisoned I'll be dead too. She... she has taken the antidote. That's why she's doing this. The antidote? Yes, I do have it. Bring me the antidote! Here it is. But Miss Chor, this is... According to Qianjin Medical Journal human waste is a panacea to all illnesses. This may be the only way to save the poisoned priest. Feed it to him. He might be dying. What are you waiting for? Do it. Come on... Eat it! What is he up to now? Oh... I feel so much better now. Human waste does work miracles. How'd you know? You didn't even take it. Just a whiff of it and I feel... refreshed and thoroughly invigorated. I'm feeling much better. What a wondrous cure. There are still traces of the poison in you. Take the antidote. No... we shouldn't waste it. Save it for those who might need it. Do you still think the wine is poisoned, sir? Where's Wan Zong-pau? Where did he go? You're in cahoots with him! No, I'm not... You pretended to be poisoned to distract us so he could make an escape. Miss Chor. Where are you going? The convict is on the loose. I must warn my men to be on the alert. No. No one is allowed to leave! - Chow Zang. Tong Kup. - Yes. He wouldn't brave this weather to escape if he had an accomplice. He must still be within the premises. Search the grounds. Yes, sir! You always say it pays to be kind. How very well it pays. More Than Meets The Eye This way. Come on. Search over there. I'll cover this area. All right. Be careful. Not that way. This way. Slow down. No signs of damage to the cuffs. They were unlocked using the key. We take turns guarding the key. The key is with Chow Zang today. Did you steal the key? You just said Chow Zang has the key. You should be accusing him, not me. How dare you! Brother Ngok! Brother Ngok! Chow Zang's dead. Chow Zang's dead. Who killed him? Wan Zong-pau! Who the hell are you? How are you related to Wan Zong-pau? You're the ones who brought him here. Why are you asking me about him? Don't believe her words! She's the one! She's in cahoots with Wan Zong-pau! Why do you always assume I'm guilty? He could be the one who released Wan Zong-pau. That's right. He went up to Wan Zong-pau earlier. He did it! What? Since you called me a fortune-teller would you allow me to give Miss Chor a face-reading? Go ahead. Have you seen your fill? So what do you see? Do you want me to be honest? Why not? Very well. I see that Miss Chor is refined, intelligent and valiant. But not someone who belongs in a troupe. Who am I then? You remind me of the heroine in the play Sister Thirteen who was out to seek revenge. You think too highly of me. We have put on that opera but that was all play-acting. "I am not who I appear to you" "or to myself." - What? - That's the couplet displayed in your theatre, don't you know? Do you even know there's a couplet here? Of course I do. It must've cost a lot to build this theatre. Why would someone who's that rich still need to perform for a living? Does it make any sense to you? This theatre is obviously not mine. I merely perform here. May I know... who your benefactor is? What benefactor? You're performing here. How can you not know who hired you? You've been blabbering nonsense. What are you trying to get at? My point is... Brother Ngok, what are we waiting for? Hang on. Constable Ngok. They say you're the finest constable around and nothing escapes your eyes. Haven't you noticed? Chow Zang... was stabbed from behind. So what if he was? Chow Zang was experienced and highly skilled. I doubt anyone could have attacked him from behind when he was on his guard. There is only one way this could have happened. The killer was someone he knew and trusted. This lunatic is in cahoots with Wan Zong-pau! He distracted us so Wan Zong-pau could make his escape! And now he's trying to sow discord among us! I'll kill you! Let him finish. Constable Chow, what did you say? Speak up. You're saying... you have something in your hand? Let go! Get lost! Tong Kup, how did Chow Zang die? Out with it! Why did you kill one of our own? Out with it! Money. I did it for money. You killed one of our brothers for money? He might be dying. What are you waiting for? Do it. The second floor. Brother Ngok! The Devilish Duo! You know a lot for a lowly constable. I've seen you before. Weren't you executed three years ago? Constables like to think our fate's sealed after you've arrested us. It's easy enough to have someone take the rap if you're willing to pay. So you've been following us and biding your time. No. We didn't follow you. We were already lying in wait when they got here. So this is an ambush. You thought you had the upper hand when you seized this place by pretending to be a theatre troupe. But we've been lying in wait all along. So this is a trap. You're in cahoots with the owner of this theatre. You finally figured it out. Not bad... Why are you doing this? Well... that's not something you need to know. Where do you think you're going, Priest? I came to seek shelter from the rain. The storm has passed so I reckon I should go. I've yet to play host to you. You shouldn't go just yet. It's all right. There'll be another time. Did you think you could seek revenge for that old coot with your paltry skills? Wan Zong-pau! Tell us who you really are. I'm nobody. Everyone here is on my list of invites. All except for you. They call me Immortal Wong. An immortal? Well, even immortals have names. Take the Eight Immortals, for instance. My name doesn't matter. What matters is that... I know your name. Let's hear it. Lok Siu-heng. Chief trader of Guangdong Thirteen Factories. Am I right? I'm a businessman. I've made a name for myself in Guangdong. I'm not surprised that you know of me. That's right. Everyone in Guangdong knows of you. But not many know what it is that you really do. What do you mean by that? It's hard to truly know a person. All the more so when said person is an accomplished actor like you. Who'd have imagined the esteemed Mr Lok chief trader of Thirteen Factories is actually in collusion with bandits to traffic in opium! Who are you? And what do you want? I'm here to watch a good show. The classic cat-and-mouse plot. Everyone here has a role to play but not everyone knows what this play is really about. Would you like me to enlighten you? He... is the enemy you're after. He's Mr Lok's henchman. He was captured in Mei District. And that turn of events had Mr Lok highly concerned. Mr Lok did all he could to save you not out of loyalty to you but because... you know too many of his secrets. He was to be escorted to the capital so that the Imperial Commissioner could interrogate him. Mr Lok, you were afraid Wan Zong-pau would give you away. And so you bribed Constable Tong. Let me guess. Constable Tong was the one who planned your travel route. The goal was to get you here and lure Wan Zong-pau's foes over too. It was a bold and very clever move to pass yourselves off as a theatre troupe and hijack this theatre. It's a shame though. Her smarts got the better of her and she fell right into your trap. Your plan is to kill the constables as well as Wan Zong-pau and lay all the blame on her. She's the perfect scapegoat because she's a bandit. You're quite the story-teller. Say you were right... I have her as my scapegoat. Why would I need to kill Wan Zong-pau? Because you know Wan Zong-pau has betrayed you. I found this on Constable Ngok. It's Wan Zong-pau's confession. If this document were to end up in the Imperial Commissioner's hands... Mr Lok, I'm sure you're well aware how dire the consequences would be. You're uttering nonsense! Am I? I have the proof right here. You know what? I've seen my fair share of men but never one who clings to his lies even when his days are numbered. - What an eye-opener. - How dare you! Very well! Since everything's out in the open now I'll make my intentions clear. Mr Lok. Wan Zong-pau killed my father. I knew these men would pass through here on their way to the capital hence my plan to use your theatre as the stage for that scoundrel's death. I've neither hurt your men, wrecked your place nor stole your possessions. All I'm after is his life to avenge my father's death. Since he has betrayed you perhaps you could do me a favour and hand him over to me. I agree! Mr Lok, don't be taken in by this priest's lies and allegations! I did not betray you! Brother Ngok... Is what he said true? Does it matter? So you're in collusion with the bandits and trafficking in opium. You're responsible for Brother Ngok and Chow Zang's deaths! So what if I am? What can you do about it? Oh, look at you. You're no match for me. White Crane Fist? Twelve Bridges. Duel of the Tiger and Crane. You're well-trained in White Crane Fist. You know of White Crane Fist too? White Crane Fist focuses on thrust swift hands and wrist blocks. Aren't those the moves you used earlier? So you're an expert. Since I'm right you must be Wong Yan-lam. The Flying Dragon Swordsman. My nickname is Flying Dragon, all right. But I am, by no means, a swordsman. They flatter me by calling me that. Time to meet your end, Flying Dragon. Perfect. Now we're trapped here. You call yourself an immortal. So why didn't you see this coming? Fancy you being at a loss for words. Immortals are no match for the wicked. Or shrews like you. Get this. If you kill me you'll never get out of here. You! Lok Siu-heng looks so mild-mannered I can't believe he's so devious. Look at this tunnel he built. A bandit is no match for a truly evil man. Is that a jab at me? I'm talking about Lok Siu-heng. I am a bandit, all right. I'm not ashamed of it. These days, nothing is what it seems anymore. We have corrupt officials and upright thieves. Who am I to pass judgment on bandits? You are more discerning than I give you credit for. But I'd like to know why you became a bandit. My father was one so of course I'm one too. So you're born into it. What? Anyway, what's the bad blood between your father and Wan Zong-pau? That blackguard flouted our rules repeatedly. My father was his friend and let him off with a slap on the wrist each time. He was unrepentant and started trafficking in opium. My father found out. My father was a bandit but he abhorred opium. He gave Wan Zong-pau a dressing-down and sent him away. Wan Zong-pau didn't take well to being exiled. He lay in wait at the bottom of the hills and assassinated my father... when he was passing through. You must avenge your father's death. But, right now, we must find our way out. Let's go. It's the Devilish Duo. Stay close to me. Follow me. Come on! I see light over there. Run! Brother Ngok! Brother Ngok... Brother Ngok... Brother Ngok... Brother Ngok... Brother Ngok... I'm sorry, Lai Yan-chiu. You're new to the job. What would you know? Brother Ngok. We've been constables for twenty years. Look at the life we've led. We put our lives on the line every day knowing each day could be our last. It's every bit as dangerous as the lives the bandits lead. Even the bandits have it better than we do! They feast and make-merry and get rich from looting. What about us? We receive a pittance for what we do. My son is very ill. He needs ginseng to stay alive. But I can't possibly afford it. He's my only child. I can't let him die. I won't! If you needed money we could've tried to help. That's right. How could you... stoop so low! I have no other choice. Let me go... You can never rid the world of evil-doers. What you've done is unforgivable! Excellent! Who are you really? My nickname is Flying Dragon. Isn't that a flying dragon... a flying dragon jade pendant you have? Give it back! A missive from the government? So you're a government official. That makes us enemies. Perhaps I should kill you before you arrest me. I'm no government official. You're not? Explain this missive then! I'm here on Imperial Commissioner Lin's request to look into Lok Siu-heng's opium dealings. I am to accomplish the task or... die trying. Are you indebted to Imperial Commissioner Lin? No. Then why would you risk your life doing this for him? That's because I lost someone dear... to opium. Do you understand now? Let's go! You're not getting away, Wong Yan-lam! I'll send you to your grave with your secret! Are you all right? Long Spear of Thirteen Moves. Wine Flying Dragon Swordsman. Do you know where we are? I'm guessing this is where you keep the opium. Correct. I'm a businessman. You know what? Money is God. Adam Smith once said "Wealth is the highest form of nobility" "and poverty, the greatest disgrace". That's why I will do anything that turns a profit. Then again... it depends on my options. Opium This is a Baker rifle that the English uses. It can kill anyone in a 230-metre radius. Much deadlier than any crossbows or flying daggers. I heard you've trained your body to be impenetrable to all weapons. Shall we give it a try? Lok Siu-heng! Oops... it misfired. I'll try to aim better, I promise. Tell me. Who sent you? What are you after? Wan Zong-pau. I wouldn't leave any loose ends if I were you. I'll leave you to it. Wait! Fine, I'll talk. I was sent here by Imperial Commissioner Lin to investigate and expose your vile deeds! I thought as much. Looks like he's going to be disappointed. What do you mean by this? Mr Lok. I've worked for you for years. You trust no one, but yourself! Oh, I get it. You want to usurp my goods. Of course! I risked my neck for everything you have today. They are rightfully mine! As the saying goes "Show no one your weapon" "unless you intend to kill". Watch out! Priest Wong, you may know literomancy but I know I-Ching divination. I drew a lot yesterday and it says to act with caution like a dragon lying in wait. You're the Flying Dragon. So, fly. Go on, fly! I guess I don't always get my readings right. Priest Wong... Why... Why are you doing this? What can be more important than money? Let me off and everything in here is yours. You can have it all. What are you doing? What... What are you doing? The first lot of I-Ching says, "Man must always strive to do what's right". That's the Tao of life. You won't get it. No! Let's go. Come on. Let's go! Will we meet again? The hills are never far from the rivers. You're right. Here, a keepsake for you. Can you do a reading for me? Give me a word. "Fate". When will the Imperial Commissioner be here? He should be here soon. Where are you going? Where else? I'm off to do readings. What about me? Wait here for Imperial Commissioner Lin. I shall take my leave. But... You get to claim all the credit.
