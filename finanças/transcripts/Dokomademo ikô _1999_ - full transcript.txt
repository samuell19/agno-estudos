Good morning! Good morning. This will last a week! Yeah. Koichi. DON'T LOOK BACK "The start of a new season. 5th grade." Where's my new shoe box? I knew it. "Meterpunch" said that he'd never let us be in the same class again. Who cares? Yeah. I guess so. Well, see you. Yeah. Long time no see. Hey, Rika! How was spring break? It was great. Rika? I went shopping. Too bad Koichi's in Class 2. You like this yogurt drink? Here. Yeah... Akira! Stop! Thief! Hey, you! I said stop! Koichi, that's a "lost article", isn't it? I'd say so. Koichi, me, Koichi, me, Koichi, me, Koichi, me. What about this? Oh. Wanna change it? Hi there, boys. What are you doing? Looking for whirligigs. Whirligigs? They're still here? Yeah. Hey, I'm a newspaper journalist. Mind if I take your picture? Go ahead. Yeah? Then, could you stay still? Koichi, are whirligigs around now? Who knows? Yeah, yeah, that's the way. Hey, are we really gonna be in the papers? I don't know. Wouldn't it be a joke? Oh, I know! Are you crazy? We can tape it again. Oh, really? No, I couldn't believe it, either. Yes, I was so surprised. That's right. He never says anything. No, he's not like that at all, he spends all of his time making things. Yes. Yes. Yes. That's right. They've been friends for a long time. This year, they're in different classes. Yes. That's right. Yes, yes. Yes. I understand. Then, when I see you next time. Yes, you're very kind. Thank you so much for calling. Good bye. Is that good? Yeah. "Look! In the papers are 5-1 Akira Hanada, 5-2 Koichi Hikawa." Boys are so stupid. Yeah. Real stupid. But isn't it cool? No. Yo. Yo. Nope. Nothing. Stupid! Missed again. Shit! Wait, we can't beat them! What are you looking at? Koichi! You think they got away? Don't know. Koichi? Hmm? Can you come tonight? You finished it? You're a genius. Isn't it cool? It's amazing, man. Let's do it! Let's go! We're gonna win! Weapons ready? Let's go! I'll get you today! See if you can! Yo. Hey. Want one? Thanks. Koichi, Koichi, look, look. Okay, stay there. Huh? What? Huh? Hey! Chisato. Don't follow us. We're not. Yes, you are. We're going that way. Stop walking in front of us. Then go ahead. No way. Why not? None of your business. Why? Where are you going? None of your business. I don't care. Then don't ask. I didn't. Just get going? Stupid. Idiot. Yo! Where's Rika? Don't you live there, Akira? No way... Why? Why are they going to my place? Yeah. I told them everything! Your dad was there, too. Who cares? Akira, I better get going. You're going home? Come on. You know my parents... Okay? I'm home. Oh, you're back. You're home. A couple of girls dropped by earlier. Oh... And? They asked for you. When I said you weren't in, they left. Huh? She was kind of cute. The length of the tunnel is 3.200 meters. 3.2 kilometers, okay? And the length of the express train is 120 meters, right? The length of the cargo is 180 meters... Hanada! Give me what you just hid. Stand outside! I... I don't want to hear it! Go. You all understand? Yo. Yo! Rocks first! Rock, paper, scissors! Again! I want hot kimchi. Me, too! Wanna buy some? You have money? Don't worry, there's some in my bag. Kinoshita, how much do you have? This much. What is that? We can't buy anything, stupid. I bought 3 comic books yesterday. What about you? You stupid, of course I don't have any, stupid. Don't call me stupid. But I guess I am. There's Nomura. Hey, what are you doing? Nomura! Hi. Let's go to your place. To my house? I'm home. Come in. Hello. May we come in? My friends... Hello. Hello. I'm sorry. This is all we have. I didn't expect any friends would come over. Thank you. Go ahead. Yeah. Is it good? Yeah. You're a good boy... Um... Mom, we're okay now. Oh. Yes. Boys, you'll stay for dinner, right? I'll go shopping and make it right now. Your mom is kind of uptight. My parents separated. They did? Yeah. I'm sorry. Let's go to your room. Wow... Did you make all this? Yeah. Cool! This is really cool... Don't touch it! It's okay. See. Is it okay? Yeah. That's my favorite. You're cool, man. Koichi. Koichi. Let's go, Koichi. Look, look! That's cute! Hey, you there! Stop fooling around! Yo. You're good. I just got started. You want some? Take it. It's bitter, huh? See ya. Hanada. Yeah? Would you like to come over again this Sunday? Why? Mom wanted me to invite you to my birthday party. Oh, well. Okay. Sunday? I won't forget. Koichi's fighting with the newcomer! Where? What's going on? It's "Meterpunch"! Come on! Koichi! Hey, wait! Wait! Hanada, I told you to wait! Damn! What happened here? A fight? Were you lynched? Hey, wait. Wait! Don't touch me! Hey! What the... What are you doing? Come here! This way! Akira. Hmm? Don't go near that guy. Yeah... I'm going now. Hang on. Be polite to Mrs. Nomura. I know. Yo, Akira. Yo. I'm bored. Let's go see a movie. A movie? Yeah. I understand. Yeah. Yeah. No, don't worry about it. Okay, see you at school tomorrow. Weren't you busy? It's okay. Hey, let's go somewhere far away. Far away? Come on! Let's see it. Yes? Oh, Akira. Hi. Koichi's not home. I thought he was with you. Oh. You want something to eat? No. Drop by again. Yo. What? I wanted to give this to you before, but I couldn't, so... Come on in. Yeah. Come in. Cool. It's not cool. Yes it is. Have a seat. Here. Yeah. You sure I can have this? I may not be able to see you again. Why? I might start living with my dad. What's that? Firecracker gun. Looks like fun. This is better. Watch. Help me. Yeah. Watch, okay? Akira, you're genius. You try. Oh, no! Huh? What? Tamayo is watching. I didn't know she lived there. Stop it, stupid. Why? Well... She's smiling. Um... Some of you may already know, but... Last night, Nomura and his mother had an accident and passed away. And... we still don't know exactly what happened... So... I'm not really sure what to say at this point... I'm sure you're all shocked... There's going to be a wake for Nomura and his mother tonight. I'm sure you all would like to go. Um... okay, I think it'd be best if we selected a few to represent the class. Okay, Nomura's friends, raise your hands. Who were friends with Nomura? Nobody? Two. Only two? Anyone else? About Nomura. It's a murder suicide. His mom was a bit weird. Yo. Yo, Akira. "Danger. Do not enter." Oh, yeah, I heard Nomura died. Who's that? Akira! You hear about Koichi? What? He ate the school hen with the newcomer. When? Last night. They baked it over a fire at the hill. They're crazy. Yo, Akira. Come over here. We have this cool plan. And we'll let you in on it. Koichi's told me about you. I don't want it. Whatever it is you're doing, do it yourselves. Bye. You lied to me. Gimme. Give it back! No way! Give it! Shut up! See you. Yeah. "Don't Look Back" by Shun Nomura What? I'm going home. Hey, what is this? Keep it.
