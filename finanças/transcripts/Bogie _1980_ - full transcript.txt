[growling] [captivating instrumental music playing] [jazz music playing] [man] That's a coincidence. I went to Andover too, and then to Harvard. Where'd you go to college, young man? [Bogart] I didn't. I got kicked out of Andover, and joined the Navy. Hmm. Well, I was a professor of oriental history until the Depression. Perhaps you haven't heard the origins of chess are found in ancient India. I thought it was invented by the Greeks. Well, anyway, as Euripides might say, Checkmate. [chuckles] That's three in a row. You're mighty good. Well, I better be. This is the first money I've earned in a long time. Hey Bogart, there's a broad waiting to see you. -Excuse me. -Do me a favor. Will you meet your broad someplace else, okay? The broad's my wife, Max. Oh, sorry. Eh, a broad's a broad. Mary, you shouldn't come here. This is no place for a lady. [Mary] The hospital called. They just brought your father in a while ago. It's another heart attack. Bad? You better hurry. Here. Here's some money for a taxi. No, thanks. I had a big morning. A buck and a half. Would you like me to come with you? Say, aren't you reading for a part this afternoon? At the Morosco. But I can postpone it. It's nothing for you to do at the hospital. -And I won't let this hurt your chances. -But... You go to the Morosco, and give a great reading. One of us has to find a job. Taxi. Dad? [groans softly] Oh, hello, son. How do you feel? A little bit tired. But I'll be all right. Sure. You've had these bouts before. [breathing heavily] Is, uh... everything going well with you? Oh, fine. Are you in a play? Yes, a good one. At the Morosco. I always had confidence in you, Humphrey. Even if your mother, uh... Huh? I know. Listen, you always said you never got a birthday present because you were born on Christmas day. Well... I, uh... I want you to have this. -Just in case I, uh... -Tomorrow. We'll talk about it tomorrow. No. No, I want you to take it. And... Please wear it. Huh? Yes. I'm sorry. There's nothing better I, uh... [exhales softly] -Have you tried radio? -Every station. No go. Well, you're not the only one that's applied. Say there's five thousand actors out of work. -Yeah. -Boy, this Depression is murder. People can't afford to go to the theater. You know what they're doing? They're reading books. Can you beat that? [Bogart chuckles] -Listen, I heard about your father. It's too... -Thanks. -He left 10,000 dollars worth of debts. -Oh. I have to pay 'em off. Humphrey, they're not your debts. As far as I'm concerned they are, he'd want me to pay 'em off. Good luck. Jerry... Anybody in there? Yeah, Arthur Hopkins is at the bar. I'll give it a shot. [chattering] Mr. Hopkins? -Hello. -Bogart. -Humphrey Bogart. -Of course. Nice to see you, Mr. Bogart. I was just passing by, and I, well, I checked with the Shuberts today and their schedule's rather small for this year. So I was wondering if you had something I might try out for. I'm only doing one show this season. There's just one part for a juvenile and I'm afraid that's been set. Mr. Hopkins, I'm 34 years old. I can't go on playing juveniles much more. There are a lot of roles I could handle. I'm sure you can. Uh, would you care for a drink? No. No, thanks. Uh, I'm meeting Al Lewis around the corner at the Astro Bar. He and Max Gordon have a comedy coming up and they want to talk to me. I wish you well, Mr. Bogart. Thank you. [man] Who's next? [man 2] Humphrey Bogart. Number of plays, few pictures in Hollywood in small roles. Contract dropped by Fox. Oh, I know this fellow. He's anyone for tennis type, but to play Duke Mantee. Hell, he's supposed to be Dillinger. Bob, just a few lines. Leslie, you don't mind? No, no, not at all. I certainly don't want to hurt an actor's ego. All right. [man] Bogart. Now we'll see some real killing, won't we? Cops ain't likely to catch up with us tonight. So we can all be peaceable and have a few beers together. Listen to the music. Don't anyone make any wrong moves. Because ol' Ruby there with the machine gun, he's pretty nervous and jumpy, and he's got the itch between his fingers. So let's everybody stay where they are. -[man] Now, hold on... -Shut up and sit down! Don't anybody try that again. Just keep in mind that I and the boys, are candidates for hanging. And if anybody makes a wrong move... I'll kill the whole lot of you. Thank you, Mr. Bogart. That will do very nicely. Mr. Bogart, where did you get that superb voice? Drinking whiskey, I suppose. [chuckles softly] Thank you, Humphrey. We'll be in touch. Uh, I could wear my lifts to make me taller, and mush my hair up. That'll be fine. Just fine. Thank you. -Well? -That's our man. He's perfect. That rough quality in his diction, very individual. He's better than I thought he'd ever be. -But I wonder if... -Bob, I want this man. We're total opposites in the play. Why, his voice and mine, they're natural enemies. I'll work with him on the part. [crowd clapping] [knock on door] -Five minutes to curtain. -They make you the stage manager? I thought you'd like to know Jack Warner bought the play today for film. -I'm to do the lead. -That's wonderful. Congratulations. And you're going to play Duke Mantee. They'll never take me, Leslie. It's too important a part. Besides, I've been out there. And I'm not much for the screen. I'm not a... personality. Now, you listen to me, Mr. B. If you're not in it, I'm not in it. And that's a promise. I can't let you put yourself out on a limb like that. Rubbish. Couldn't play this part with anyone else. You do more by doing less than any actor I ever saw. Can I offer a grain of advice? This time when you're in Hollywood, take the offensive. Those bigwigs can be demoralized by someone who throws the meat on the floor. See you in Hollywood. [pensive music playing] [Warner] Whose studio is this anyway? Yours or mine? [Bogart] Yours, Mr. Warner. [Warner] Right. No one's gonna tell me how to run my studio or who's gonna be in my pictures. I'm sorry, Mr. Warner. The way I see it, a deal is a deal. And the way I see it, I'm president of Warner Brothers, and Edward G. Robinson is going to play the desperado in The Petrified Forest, no matter what this says. If you don't mind my asking, what is that? Oh, Bogart. I've been known to make a bad joke now again. But I am no damn fool. You know what this is. It's a cable from Scotland. From Leslie Howard. And stop acting innocent because you obviously put him up to it. Does it say "No Bogart, no Howard"? Yeah. Now, you cable him back. Tell him you don't want the part. Oh, I couldn't do that, Mr. Warner. He's a friend of mine. I wouldn't want to frustrate him. Besides, Duke Mantee isn't just a desperado. Oh? [scoffs] What is he? A hairdresser? [laughs smugly] No. He's malevolence. He's what? Mr. Warner, do you know what The Petrified Forest is all about? Well, I bought it, didn't I? It's about this bum who's on the lam. He lies low in this cheap restaurant and holds some people hostage. Yeah, and it's also about the quintessence of malevolent power pitted against the illusions of civilized society. You're pretty confident, aren't ya? [exhales] You have to be confident to play Duke Mantee as well as I do. [soft music playing] I passed the theater where The Petrified Forest is playing. There was a line around the block, Mr. Bogart. I haven't seen your wife for quite a while. Neither have I. She go back to New York again? She keeps going back and forth looking for a good play. I'm going to have to ask the Super Chief for a discount. Here's to rejection, Huey. You want another drink, Mr. Bogart? Why not? You know, I don't trust anyone who doesn't drink. If you drink, you live longer. Huey... the whole world is three drinks behind. If everybody in the world would take three drinks... there'd be no trouble. [girls screaming] [banging] My car has never had a scratch on it. You're gonna pay for this. Glad to. Give me your address, and I'll mail you a cup of black paint in the morning. Wait a minute, I know who you are. You're that, uh, that actor gangster. That's right. I'm Humphrey Bogart, the killer. Hey, look, you better not lay a hand on me. [stuttering] My father is a judge. I'll have your license revoked. Good. I need to walk more anyway. Probably don't even have insurance. Junior... I don't like your attitude or your jaw. It's under slung. I think I'll reconstruct it for you. [clamoring] [chuckles] He's a giant. He could've clobbered you. Oh, sure. But after we tossed a few more insults back and forth, I succeeded in getting five or six of the crowd to hold me back. Well, keep playing the tough guy image. Fans are starting to write in, and the press loves it. Well, I get a boot out of it, a man's got to have some kind of fun. [jazz music playing] Thanks. Say, pal... How does a guy have any fun at a party like this? You don't. You don't even get any tips. [chuckles] [whispers] Bogie. Bogie. The Oscar for the most beautiful woman in the room, Mayo Methot. [gasps] Oh, thank you. [giggling] Thank you. Oh! Well, I would like to thank everybody who made it possible for me. My mother, my father. My dentist who straightened my teeth when I was seven. My ophthalmologist who straightened my eyes when I was 12. And my gynecologist who... -[scattered laughter] -Oops. [Mayo chuckling] Oh, I shall cherish it always. [all applauding] Oh, uh, Mr. Randolph, I would like you to meet Mr. Bogart. How do you do? [Bogart sighs] I've known Mayo since we worked in Marked Womantogether. Oh? We met only a few days ago. Did you find her, sort of, well, unpredictable? Yeah, that's what I like about her. She doesn't telegraph her shots. -[Mayo] Sit down, honey. -Oh... Well... Humphrey. Mayo, you haven't aged an inch. [chuckles softly] Thank you. -How's your wife? -Mary? New York. Broadway. She's wedded to the theater. Can't live without those curtain calls. Mary... she's getting a divorce. Mayo, you were on the stage once, weren't you? What? Oh, yeah. Um, well... Bogie and I are having a little reunion here. So, would you just mind go and read a book or take a nap or something? I mean, I'm a two-time loser myself, you know. My divorce is in process. You know the grounds? Brutality. Oh. Lacerations, and a broken nose, broken into two places. It's a fine nose. Whoever fixed it did a fine job. His nose! He's the one who's getting a divorce. [laughs] I did slug him awful hard. [both laugh] Uh, excuse me. I didn't mean to be impolite. I've had enough of this. Come on, I'm taking you home. What're you talking about? I don't wanna go home. Come on! [object clattering] Oh! Now, look what... Well, are you just... I'll buy you another one. Come on! [grunts] [laughs] ♪ Embrace me My sweet embrace ♪ Come on, sluggy. -Let's dance. -Oh, I love that song. Does something to me. Makes me feel like making love. Fightin'. I don't mind making a fool of myself, but I mean, I feel sorry for you. Oh, my lady, you're talking about the best damn night I've had in months. I oughta be able to handle the juice better. Learn not to cross the line. That's what I do. I don't know if I can. This town... [mumbles] just can't seem to lick it. You're not the only one. After I finished The Petrified Forest, I thought I'd shoot straight to the top. I seemed to be stalled dead center. All they do is slot me as the heavy picture after picture. Well, at least you're working. That's a step or two up from me. But you are good, Bogie. Really good. Thanks. -So are you. -Oh, I don't know. My career is on a very low burner. I'm down to playing waitresses and hookers. They don't appreciate you. You were terrific in Marked Woman. Your technique and emotion... You're overloaded with sex appeal. [slow instrumental music playing] Thanks. I needed that. You are the sweetest, dearest guy. Come on. I'll take you home. If I know what's on your mind, Bogie... Stay away. I don't want to hurt you. And I can be bad business. I think a night cap at your place is in the cards. [Bogart] We've had her six months, first time she hasn't started. [Mayo] How about letting me tinker with that engine now. [Bogart] Mayo, I've been around boats all my life. -Did you check the coil? -It's not the coil. Now that's the first thing you gotta do, is check the coil. My father told me that and he's the-- Finest sea captain on the Orient Run. You've told me that a half dozen times. I did? [chuckles] Bogie. Just relax. Check the coil. All right, all right. Never let it be said... [sighs] Turn it over. [engine starts] [engine whirring] All right, that's it. It's all over. It's finished. I won't stay shacked up with a girl who knows more about boats than I do. Oh, sweetheart, forgive me. I never would have said anything if I'd known you were going to get so upset. Oh, Bogie, it's colossal being shacked up with you. I mean, it's heaven. We have such great times. Even when we... Even when we fight! Hold it. What I meant to say was the shacking up is over. It's time for the big step. Let's get married, Mayo. What do you say? Oh, Bogie! I love you! I love you! I love you! Why did you scare me like that? I just wanted to see how you'd react. Damn you, Bogart! -Don't you ever do that to me! -Mayo, Mayo, Mayo... [Mayo] I'll kill you! I'll kill you! [grunting] -Hello, folks. -Bogie, darling, how are ya? Hi, Bogie. -Come on in. -Thank you. Are we early? -You said six o'clock. -You're right on time. [gunshot] What's that? Check your watches. There should be another in two or three minutes. Mayo and I are having a little spat. [gunshot] I'll disarm her. Mayo! Mayo, open the door! Keep outta here. [gunshot] [Bogart] Open the damn door or I'm going to break it in. [Mayo] You rotten little ham actor. You just happened to make it big. [gunshot] Get out of here or I'll plug you. [Bogart] Pat and Zelma are here. Did you forget? We asked them for dinner? No. Did you forget we were having a fight? No! But for the life of me... I can't remember what it was about. Me either. [laughs] [both laugh] Would you call that living dangerously? No, no. They're a typical average, sedate, sober married couple. Sorry, folks, Mayo got tankin' drunk. No harm done. Let's have a drink. Maybe I'm meddling, but after all almost three years of this, how can you stand it? Can't you two find some way to get on a little more peacefully? We have no illusions about each other, Pat. Marriage is no good with illusions. Sluggy loves a fight, and I have to be a good husband and go along with it. Well, that's a funny formula to make your bed of roses. Yes, I got good with that. Well, anyway, you're going to have to get a new door. [laughs] Come with me. We need a new door at least once a month. The studio carpenter makes 'em for me wholesale. -[all chuckling] -Bogie. Carousing, raising hell in bars. Your wife setting fire to your house. Give Mayo my love, by the way. Fighting in restaurants. Oh, listen, Jack, I've got two rules about that. First, always get near a big head waiter so he'll stop the fight. Second, and equally important, never step outside. So don't worry, I won't get a broken nose. Uh, well, what if you did? Nothing could happen to that face that would hurt it a bit. Good joke, Jack. Yeah, but this isn't. Calling me a creep in this interview. How dare you? The dictionary says a creep is a loathsome, crawling creature... That's when you spell it with a C, I spell it with a K. Oh, very funny. Who's making the bad jokes now? If I offended you, I apologize. You know, I believe you sometimes pull stunts just so you can apologize to me afterwards. Calm down, Jack, I've got some news for you. Have you read this masterpiece you cast me in? Yes. I glanced through it carefully. Since Petrified Forest, I've done 29 pictures for you. Mostly playing gangsters. Here's another one. I've been electrocuted, hanged and shot. I wear the same suit and I say the same lines. "Put your hands up." "Get up there against the wall." "Don't move or I'll shoot." I never play the romantic par. I never get the girl. Get the girl? Well, you're not the type. To be a leading man, you've got to be able to carry a picture. Well, I carried High Sierra, didn't I? I played the lead in that. No, that was a gangster. You'll never be a Robert Taylor or a Tyrone Power. Ask any producer, director on the lot. Yeah. Well, some of them could fit very nicely under a horse's tail. Anyway, this one's out. I've got enough money in my WBSF. What's that? Warner Brothers suspension fund. -Oh. -[intercom beeping] Oh, I've got enough trouble with Bette Davis without any of your nonsense. Actors like you trying to run the studios, expecting to be stars... -[intercom beeps] -...in only four or five years. Yes. Well, you can tell George Raft... Never mind. All right, let's forget this script. I've got a picture for you. You don't get the gal, but it's a lead and it's not a gangster. Who turned it down before Raft? Cagney or Robinson? Uh, both. [scoffs] -Why? -Oh, the director. He's an unknown. Who is it? Walter Huston's kid, John. He wants to be a director. [sighs] What's it called? Uh... let's see. Titles got some "bird" in it. [crowd clapping] [Bogart] I believe in speaking my mind. I don't believe in hiding anything. Of course, that gets me into a lot of trouble. [crowd laughs] If I want to make a jackass out of myself, it's my business, don't you think? [crowd clapping] Nobody likes me on sight. I suppose that's why I've always played the heavy. It must be something about the tone of my voice, or this mug of mine that antagonizes everybody. I can't even get in to a mild discussion without it turning into a violent argument. And if I try to be polite, you can hear it for 40 miles. [crowd laughs] If I open a door for a lady, my arm gets in the way. So she has to duck under it or get hit in the nose. [crowd laughs and claps] [jazz music playing] You didn't say anything that's so funny or clever tonight. But the audience went off its trolley over you. Why? Why do they like you so much, huh? Because you're so damn cool? Maybe. Maybe it's because I make my own rules. Stick to them. Maybe it's because... you got something that nobody can buy. Or learn. You've got to be born with it. Class. [Leonard] Good evening. Hi, Lenny. -Mayo, say hello to Leonard Lyons. -Hello, Leonard. Mrs. Bogart. Sit down, Leonard. -What's happening tonight? -The city is dead tonight. I've covered 21, Stork, half a dozen other places. Not a single item. How are the battling Bogarts? Well, write down that the former actress Mayo Methot was out on the town and tell 'em that she gave it all up for Bogart. Nobody pays any attention to me anymore. I wouldn't say that. I mean, I don't like being left out, you know. I'm only human. Oh, damn it, I forgot. Leonard, Mayo's human. Why you always needle me so much? 'Cause I just love to watch you blow up. -[gasping] -[guests exclaiming] Are you trying to prove you're a tough guy? My wife threw it. She likes to express herself. But we both apologize. Waiter, bring this gentleman a magnum of champagne and put it on my bill. Tough guy. I hear you don't sign autographs for kids. You brush 'em off to prove how tough you are. Sluggy, I think it's time for us to get started back to the hotel. You're as tough as a Kewpie doll. [both grunting] He can't do that! [man screaming] [Mayo] I'll kill you! She's even tougher than Bogart. [all laughing] Mayo, you've won. You've won, darling. [breathing heavily] She's magnificent. I never go anywhere with her. [all laughing and cheering] Women in this country are crazy. Fan mail high as a giraffe. You know what they're saying? You've got sex appeal. Maybe they know something you don't, Jack. -Okay. -[Bogart chuckling] Hal Wallis wants you for the romantic lead in this. I won't say no to him. I'm making 50 pictures this year, so I suppose one of them could be a dog. That big, Swede, Ingrid Bergman, she's playing the girl, so you'll need a stepladder to come up to her shoulders. ["As Time Goes By" piano music playing] -[woman] Morning, Mr. Hawks. -Morning. Far as I know, you're the only guy who ever parlayed a trench coat and a sinister expression into a huge career. How's it feel to be king of the 1-11? "My kingdom stands on brittle glass." That's Shakespeare, Howard. Oh yeah, I've heard of him. By the way, how's your schedule? I'm preparing the Hemingway picture. I'd like to start directing it next spring. That should work out. Mayo and I are taking a USO tour for a couple of months to Italy and Africa. We'll be back by then. -How is Mayo? -Stone drunk every night. You bear with it pretty well. I don't know, Howard, it's getting sticky. Oh, by the way, who's playing the girl in the picture? Well, actually, I'm working with a new girl. I'd like to make her part as insolent as you sometimes are. Fat chance, Howard. -What's her name? -Wouldn't mean anything to you. She's a model. My wife saw her picture on the cover of a fashion magazine. Oh, wait a minute, Howard. -I have approval of my-- -Yeah, I know. Just have a look. [Howard] Well? She's a very long girl. Well, not bad for a first reading. Let's go back to the page 50. I want to try that scene again. Just Bogie and Betty. Okay, Betty. "Oh, I forgot. "You wouldn't take anything from anybody, would you?" "That's right." "You know, Steve, you're not very hard to figure. "Only at times. "Sometimes, I know exactly what you're gonna say. Most of the times. "The other times... the other times, you're just a stinker." Sits on his lap and kisses him. Oh, and, Bogie, when we shoot this, there'll be very little reaction from you. All right, kiss is over. What'd you do that for? I was wondering whether I'd like it. What's the decision? I don't know yet... [Howard] She kisses him again. This time Steve puts his arms around her and returns the kiss. All right. The passionate kiss is over. It's even better when you help. Let's turn to Page 52. Betty, I just want Marie's last speech. "You know, you don't have to act with me, Steve. "You don't have to say anything. "You don't have to do anything. "Not a thing. "Oh, maybe just whistle. "You know how to whistle, don't you, Steve? "You just put your lips together and blow." [Howard] Hold it, Betty. Let me see that look again. And, uh, Bogie when you get it, I want a reaction. Very small, but very definite. Huh? Dialogue's even better when they're not talking. [all laughing] [buzzing] [Bogart] Relax, long girl. Sorry. I'm so nervous, they can hear my knees shaking in Boston. Umpteen takes and I can't catch the damn matchbox, and I probably never will. It's nothing. I did something much more serious on my first picture. It took them an hour to get me a new pair of pants. Oh, here. I've been wrong. It's my fault. I have been throwing the matchbox too low all this time. Come on, let's go back and show them the right way to throw a matchbox. You're very transparent, Mr. Bogart. And very sweet. Say... do your eyes bother you? -No, why? -They bother me. Argh... [giggles] [Bogart] Beautiful day, isn't it? [Betty] Beautiful. Actually, it's a beautiful day for the race. -What race? -Human race. [chuckling] Oh, God. [screaming] [laughing] Bogie. You. Essentially, man to woman, I don't consider the fact you're only 19 means very much. I was once out of my head with a girl of 14. -Fourteen? -Yeah. Of course. I was 15. -Oh. -[Bogart laughs] Her name was Pickles, see. -My first date. -[man] Mr. Bogart. Yeah? Your wife's on the phone. How many times that make today? Same condition? Tell her I... Tell her I, uh, drank a glass of formaldehyde thinking it was gin. And they're pumping me out right now. [slow instrumental music playing] Bogie. If anybody ever gets a picture of us here, it'll be in every paper in the country. A kiss in my family was an event. My folks didn't gush over me. My mother hated sentiment. If I'd ever sent her a Mother's Day wire or said it with flowers, she'd have returned the wire or the flowers. Collect. You know, there's something about you. What? A fly. [both laugh] -[Bogart] Lunch. -[Betty] Coming. -Going to lakeside? -Why not? What're you doing? Bogie, Bogie! Bogie, That's not funny. Bogie! [Mayo] Oh, hi, lover boy. How you doing with your daughter? I'm gonna come down and visit the set, and go up on the catwalk and drop a lamp on her. Please, Mayo, I'm very tired, and I'm feeling low today, so I just as soon not argue. Low. You feeling low? Come home and you see me and it makes you feel low, huh? Get it, world! Flash. The great Humphrey Bogart, big Warner Bros. star is feeling low today. And what about the other night? Said that you were out with the cast. Is that what they call her? The cast? I'll put her in a cast. Gave up my whole career for you. You never even got me one part. Not one little part. Stand up, Mayo. Now, walk straight ahead. The only part that woman in the mirror could play is a dipsomaniac. Damn you! Don't throw it because I'm not throwing anything back. That jazz is over. You used to be fun. After six years, it's no fun. You're sick. Mayo. Listen... About half dozen of our friends have been to AA and come out like new. I told you a hundred times I'm not an alcoholic. See a psychiatrist. [Mayo] I don't want to see a psychiatrist! Everyone needs a psychiatrist. Psychiatrists need psychiatrists. I gave up my career for you. You turned me into a once-was. Nobody could make me as mad as you except my mother. -Your mother? -Yes, my mother! And all your wives are older than you, or almost. Maybe that's why you want Bacall, huh? Get rid of the older broads. -Get rid of your mother! -[Mayo screams] [grunts] [exhales] It's the only time you ever hit me first. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I... I want a divorce. I'll give you anything you want. No. No divorce. All I want is you. See a doctor, Mayo. I'm moving out tomorrow morning. No divorce! [slow instrumental music playing] Whether it turns out good or bad, it's the best picture I ever made. I know. I almost cried at the set party. I didn't want it to be over. Yeah. I know you'll never say it, but I will. I love you, Bogie. [chuckles] Well, you'll appreciate it when I'm 65, and you'll be-- I'll age rapidly. It's important to be in love, Betty, it's comforting. It's the one emotion that relieves the condition we all have... loneliness. You're a fraud, Mr. Bogart. Underneath that cynical front, you're a gentle, sensitive man. Just because I happen to love you. You said it. It took a hell of an effort. I don't mind going on the way we are. Sooner or later, Mayo will have to give in. I hope so. I want to have children while I'm still young. Oh. There was a time I--I wanted to have a family. I'd make a rotten father now. I'd be lousy with kids. Wouldn't I? After five or six... You'd be just fine. [Pat] Hey, get this line from The Hollywood Reporter. "Miss Bacall does not walk. "She romps away with the have and have-nots. [all laughing] [Zelma] So, get a load of this in the LA Times. "She is willowy as a reed, ever persuasive in the torrid scene." Winchell calls her the "Bacall of the wild." -Ooh. -Listen to what the Timessays. "Lauren Bacall has cinema personality to burn." Ah. "Humphrey Bogart turns in an etch portrait of Nietzsche in dungarees." "Nietzsche in dungarees"? I'm going to sue them. "She has a javelin-like vitality." "Javelin-like vitality." "She growls the shady song more suggestively than anyone since Mae West." The critics are incredible. They're stupendous. [Zelma] They're so perceptive. Now, if she doesn't come down to Earth, someone like me, is going to tell them that that was a professional singer and not Betty doing that song. That is a miserable lie. Somebody made up that story, and I wouldn't be at all surprised-- -Mr. Bogart? -Yes? Telephone from Los Angeles. They said it was an emergency. I had to say emergency Bogie because I knew that you wouldn't talk to me otherwise. No, please, Bogie. Don't hang up. I've been to see a psychiatrist. And I'm down to two drinks a day. I swear. One in the morning to get my eyes open, and one when I go to bed at night so that I can sleep. I've had a manicure and my hair done. We've had so many good times, darling. -Mayo, listen. -Say a few kind words to me, Bogie. Just a few kind words. The doctor said that would help. -Mayo-- - Give me a another chance, Bogie. Come home. Come back, please. I'm taking vitamins. I'll do anything, Bogie. I'll become a democrat if you want me to. I'll even vote for Truman. Mayo. He says I need help. [stammering] I might do something really violent. I might, I might even... [crying] Mayo. Mayo? [receiver clicks] [crying] [line disconnects] Pat, would you and Zelma clear out, please? Anything bad? I just want to talk to Betty alone. Sure. Come on. I could go into a little of it, or a lot of it. Go into the end of it. I'm going back to her. She thinks I can help her. I owe her that. Maybe more. It's a marriage, Betty. It's my responsibility. Do I have to say anything? No, but I do. [sighs] I'll never get over you. Bogie. Would you mind not reading for a minute? Remember that night on the USO tour? When I locked you in the barracks and you started trying to break the door down? Yeah. You remember that colonel you insulted? [Bogart] I remember. And the next day, the Army made you apologize. Remember what you said? Yeah. I told them, uh, I was sorry, that I didn't mean to insult the uniform. I only meant to insult him. [laughs] That's so funny. Thing I remember most about that trip... Was all those boys in those hospitals. Is that what being back with me reminds you of? Someone wounded? No, honey. I know it's tough. Just take it easy. -Had a good trip? -[Bogart] Great. Cut the engine, Mayo. [Pat] That's Santana. -That's Dick Powell's yacht. -[Bogart] I know. The day he wants to sell her, that's the day I'm gonna buy her. It's kind of a dream of mine, Pat. I wish you luck. [both laugh] What's that? [Bogart] Orange juice. -Yuck. -Drink it and shut up. Thanks, Bogie. -Did my car come back, Zelma? -Mmm. I'm sorry, Bogie. The repair shop called. It isn't ready. Damn it! Mayo's got a 9:00 a.m. appointment. No, I don't. So, it's all right. We can sleep here. I canceled it. I canceled all of them. That doctor gets me so riled up. Anyway, he made a pass at me. I got to go to the head. I hear you took another suspension. [Bogart] Yeah. Lousy picture. You did the right thing. I don't know. If I stay away too long, maybe one day there won't be any work. Oh, for heaven's sakes. There'll always be work for you, Bogie. You're a star. You're not a star until they know how to spell your name in Karachi. [all laughing] Oh, you're all talking about me, huh? I knew the minute I left the room, you'd all start picking me apart. No, no, we weren't, Mayo. We were discussing that-- When was the last time you had a glass of scotch thrown in your face? Put the damn drink down, Mayo. Cocktail hour is over, folks. [Mayo humming] [Mayo] Bogie. Bogie, where are you? Too good to sleep inside now, huh? You can't treat me that way. Cockroaches! All of them. Cockroaches. You too, Bogie. I am not a schizo-- Schizoid. One stick of spearmint and you can't even tell I've been drinking. ♪ Embrace me My sweet embrace- ♪ ♪ able you Bogie why don't you ever drink with me anymore? Bogie, wake up and have a drink. Don't be such a cockroach! -[Bogart] Shut up! -[Mayo screams] -Get below and pass out. -[Mayo screams] [Bogart] Shut up! Pass out before I knock you out. [breathing heavily] You wanna fight, huh? You still a tough guy, huh? [sinister music playing] Okay. I'll show you. I'll show you. [screams] [Bogart grunting in pain] [Mayo] Bogie, are you all right? I didn't know what I was doing, Bogie. Talk to me. [Pat] What happened? Never mind that. Just take a look at my back. -I'll get a doctor. -No, just patch me up. -I've got to get out here. -Don't be a fool, Bogie. This is a serious cut. -Please. -Bogie, I'm... Zelma, get the first aid kit, will you? Right. [Mayo] Bogie, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to hurt you. I didn't know what I was doing. Keep away from me. Oh, please forgive me, Bogie. I didn't know what I was doing. I didn't mean to hurt you. I love you, Bogie. Please forgive me. Stop it, Mayo! It had to come to this. [Mayo crying] One of us trying to kill the other, any more, one of us will. -I'm through, for keeps. -No! [screams] No! No! [Mayo crying] It's over, Bogie. I know it. Please forgive me. You can have your divorce but just... please forgive me. You wanna light, big boy? I came as soon as you called. God, how I need you. [Bogart] Isn't she a beauty? I never thought Dick Powell would let her go. But she's mine now. [Betty] Sure cost you enough. [Bogart] I'd have paid double for her. Don't ever tell him that. -[Betty laughing] -Pete, meet Mrs. Bogart. [Betty] Hello, Pete. [Pete] Real glad to meet you, ma'am. -And welcome aboard. -Thank you. [Bogart] Pete's second in command. Caretaker and the keeper of the bottles. Come on, I'll show you around. [captivating instrumental music playing] Oh, look at him. He's the handsomest ugly man you've ever seen. I think your best pictures are The Maltese Falcon and Casablanca,Bogie. But what are your favorites? That's easy. Those two big ones, of course. The two I did with Betty. To Have and Have Not and The Big Sleep. Oh, and also add Action in the North Atlantic. I like working with Raymond Massey. Oh, that's one of those they say had Communist propaganda in it. [scoffs] You don't believe that, Louella. One doesn't know what to believe these days. It's about as communistic as Up in Mabel's Room. [laughing] I understand the two of you are flying to Washington to defend the unfriendly ten. Those Reds. We're not going there to defend the Communists. We're going there to give hell to the Un-American Activities Committee. They're raping the Bill of Rights, Louella. I believe a person's religion or politics is his own business. You two really do stick together. That's only because we're crazy about each other. And lots of people thought this wouldn't last out a year. Stanislaus? Stanley... Steven. [car honks] Hello, darling. -How'd it go today? -Fine. Fine. Any news? I called you from the set. Couldn't get you. What'd the doctor say? He said, "Yes." Sure? Sure. We're going to have a baby. [cutlery clattering] You didn't like your chop, Mr. Bogart? Sure I did, May. I just wasn't hungry, that's all. -Finished? -Mm-hmm. Those lamb chops were like leather. May must be getting old. It has nothing to do with her age. Oh, yeah? She's almost as old as I am. And I'm 49. It has to do with the stove. I've told you. What's the matter with stove? It's no good. We need a stainless steel stove. -Stainless steel? -Yes. It makes the food taste better. It's easier to clean. And it looks a hell of a lot better in the kitchen. Uh-huh. I see it coming. Your little art of misdirection. First, a new stove. Then the kitchen isn't big enough for the stove, and we don't have enough closet space. My guess is what you're driving at is a new house. Well, there's nothing wrong with a new house either, now that you brought it up. I brought it up? You brought it up! Well, I don't want a new house. I want to go on living under my income. And you were brought up in a crowded New York apartment with two rooms and a bath, and there is nothing wrong with you. Bogie, darling. This child isn't going to come between us. It's just going to make things even better. And even though it only happens once in a while, we're gonna live happily ever after. [woman over P.A.] Dr. Wilson, Dr. Wilson, please. [slow instrumental music playing] [woman] Dr. Gardner, Dr. Gardner, please. Mr. Bogart? Yes? [nurse] You have a little boy. Little boy? He's your son, Mr. Bogart. [chuckles softly] Oh. Yeah. See this, Steve? They gave it to me last night. I'm very proud of it. He's called Oscar. Here, hold it. Ow! [laughs] That's not funny, Steve. [giggles] Go to your room. No. I said go to your room! [Steve cries] [door closes] Not the way to handle it, huh? [clicks tongue] When you tuck him in tonight, tell him you love him very much. I don't know how to say, "I love you very much" to a child. My folks never said it to me. Well, don't make the same mistake. You only get from children as much love as you give them. I knew I was too damned old to be a father. Really? Well, mister, have I got news for you. [chuckles softly] [laughs heartily] I shall not favor reducing taxes until we are getting in a dollar to cover every dollar we spend. And I'll bank on the American people even in an election year, to understand straight talk and the need for a balanced budget in this country. Well, he certainly speaks sense to the American people. I never said he didn't. -But you're still for Eisenhower. -Yes. Oh, I feel like taking this off, and going in a sweater and sneakers. Great. Everybody will be staring at you, just what you always like. Oh, Betty, come and give me a hand with this damn thing, will you? He's judicious, he's informed. And he's so honest. He'll make the best president. Let me help. George Washington. -You simply don't know enough about him. -Oh, yes, I do. Since I find Stevenson literature on the bathroom sink, on the kitchen table, Stevenson next to the scotch in the den. You look heavenly. I'm going to the rally for him in San Francisco day after tomorrow. You might have asked. You could have told me. Okay, go ahead. Oh, boy... [sighs] I used to be a free and easy hooligan until I married you. Cut down on my drinking, I mellowed, I even became a family man. I have two kids now. I go with it. All of it, all of it. But just don't try to become my political conscience. Nine and a half years. And if I had to do it all over again... Go on. I'd do it twice. So would I. [chattering] So far tonight, he's insulted eight bigshots. I mean, insult. A couple of them were about to break his neck, but he turns on that impish appeal of his and gets away with it. -Hmm. -He says it's an art with him to see how close he can come to calamity at a party. You know, Betty, my dear, Bogie is a very complex man. There are a lot of people who detest him, but he's 100% of what he is, and that's very original. So you... you take the disadvantages with the advantages. [woman laughing] And keep your sense of humor. Hmm. Oh, if I know Bogie, a bar is as far as any dame's going to get with him. Nevertheless, I think it's about time I made myself known. Just to keep the franchise, Peter. Oh, never? -You actually mean never, ever? -Never have. Basically, I'm an old-fashioned slob. Excuse me. I hope you don't mind the intrusion, but I have this absolutely mad temper, and I lose it when anybody tries to get her hooks into this gent. Still feel bad about that girl I strangled. Oh, yeah. That was rude. [gasps] -Aren't you? -Yes, my dear, that I am. How about buying me a drink, Superboy? Sure. Slim. How about my buying it for you in San Francisco. Did I hear you say San Francisco? I don't know why, the longer we're at this party, the more I like Adlai Stevenson. [both laugh] [Bogart] Ah, this is what it's all about, Pete. All those hours in makeup, all the hot lights, all the waiting around, talk deals... So that I can at least have this once a week. [coughing] [chattering] Oh, Mr. Romanoff. Madam, I am not Mr. Romanoff. I am His Imperial Highness Prince Mikhail Alexandrovitch Dmitry Obolensky Romanoff, the nephew of the last of the Czars. Oh. -Uh, I just wanted to ask-- -Excuse me. -Good afternoon, dear boy. -Good afternoon, my precious humbug. Buddy Fogelson arrived yet? We have a luncheon date. He's waiting at the bar. I will bring him to your table. Oh, look who's here. [coughs] They say he's the only one allowed in here without a tie. Oh. Hi, Bogie. How are you? Good, Buddy. Have a seat. Bogie, this is the check you signed for lunch yesterday. Now, you had six companions, including me. Sure. Don't you remember, Mike? We played the match game for the check and I lost. But this is not your usual signature, Bogie. -It isn't? -Peter Rabbit? [Bogart] Come on, Mike. You don't want to let me get stuck with a luncheon bill this big, do you? Your reputation as a tightwad is not undeserved. [laughs] [coughing] Are you all right? Oh, sure. Probably just a bone I swallowed from an omelet I ate here last week. You ought to do something about that, Bogie. Buddy is going to the Beverly Hills Clinic this afternoon after lunch to see a dentist. Why don't you go with him and talk to a doctor about that? [Fogelson] Bogie, there's a fine throat specialist there. I know him. Dr. Maynard Brandsma. Yes, yes. [Fogelson] Please, Bogie. What time did you make the appointment for, Buddy? [Dr. Brandsma] I told you, no more smoking. I like your personality, Doctor, but I don't like your treatment. You've had me on a diet, you've x-rayed and fluoroscoped me. Taken a hunk of flesh out of my throat. But I'm coughing more than ever and I'm tired all the time. Can't you sail a little closer to the wind? That hunk of flesh came back from the lab. You have an ulcer in your esophagus. And it's malignant, Mr. Bogart, it's got to be removed. I've asked Dr. John Jones to perform the operation. He's the best, by the way. I have reserved a room for you at the hospital for tomorrow morning. Well, that's impossible. My wife and I are starting a picture on Monday. I'll have the operation after we finish. If you make the picture first, you'll be a big hero at Forest Lawn. So long, kids. [both] Daddy! I'm leaving. We'll come see you at the hospital, Dad. I'll bring you some marshmallow. Oh, thank you, sweetheart. But I don't think they allow kids there. [girl] Oh... [Bogart] If you take care of Mommy, when I come out, we'll go to that new place, Disneyland. [kids] Yay! Now go back and play. [coughing] So, how long will it take? He said about two hours. I'll be in the hospital for a week. Come by and see me if you feel like it. Oh, I will. Except I'm kind of booked up this week. Well, I'll, uh... give you a ring and tell you how it went. Fine. Leave a message with May if I'm out. What's that? You have a room in that hospital? No, darling, I have a cot in your room. You don't think I'm going to let those oversexed drooling nurses get their mitts on you. Did I ever tell you I married the classiest broad in this town? [low voice] I just want to know, Doc, why was I on the table for eight hours? Dr. Jones removed the ulcer from your esophagus. But he found the growth had spread to the lymph glands too. He removed them also. Go on. We believe he got rid of all of it. But convalescence is going to be a long haul. Long or short, you can bet your bird... I'm gonna whip this. [Dr. Brandsma] Good. You're quite a patient, Mr. Bogart. I've got to leave now. Oh, enjoy your lunch. It usually tastes good until the Demerol wears off. Bye. [door closes] [mellow instrumental music playing] [sighs] Boy, am I glad to get out of that dog den. Really? I was mad about it. There's no place like home, right? Oh, listen, I want to tell you a dilly our daughter came up with. The other day she said, "Mommy, I had a nightmare." I said, "Really, that's very interesting." She said, "Mommy, what's a nightmare?" [both laugh] [Bogart coughing] [Betty] Don't be afraid. Pick her up. [Bogart] She's only four hours old. I'd drop her. [Betty] She'll bounce. Girls are just like boys. They don't break easily. Pick her up. [Bogart] Okay. Hey, look at these little fingers. They're pretty, aren't they? Nightmares are what you don't have when Daddy kisses you goodnight, doll. Sorry I haven't been to your place for a while, Mike. My dear boy, I much prefer to come here. I spend too much time at the restaurant anyway. Did I ever tell you that during the war I played running chess games with servicemen all over the world. -Usually let them win. -[Mike chuckles softly] Did I ever beat you? I think not. But then nobody does. [laughs] [Leslie] Stop it! [Stephen] I won't if you stop. -[Leslie] Stop! -[Leslie screams] Excuse me, I gotta go and belt somebody. -[Stephen] Were too. -[Leslie] Was not. Stop it, stop it, stop it. Stephen Bogart, what's going on here? Leslie Bogart, what's going on here? Stephen's shooting me with a rubber band. Oh, I wasn't shooting her much. -Were too. -Was not. Shut up, Steve. I don't want to have to rap you. You had no right in shooting Leslie with rubber bands. She's littler. She's female. They cause us a lot of trouble but we gotta endure it. Leslie was teasing me. I don't care what she was doing. Come on, now, be a gentleman. I will if you'll take me sailing again. Please, Dad. You promised you'd teach me how to steer too. I'll keep that obligation in mind. Yes, Richard. Everyday. But only one or two at a time. Around five o'clock in the den. You're darn right he's allowed to drink. Okay, I'll put you down for Saturday. Richard Burton. Saturday. I warn you, he loves to torture visitors by drawing grizzly diagrams of the operation. Swifty Lazar brought a girl over here and she fainted. Of course, Bogie couldn't have been happier. Mmm... smell that air. Yeah. [grunts] You all right? Sure. it's just that stitch across my shoulders. I heard only yesterday. Who do you suppose is in the hospital? Who? Sick people. Oh, oh you. That's terrible. I tried that on Steve, but he didn't get it. Well, that's because he's a smart boy. Oh, I love Sundays. Listen, I think it's time for Leslie to take riding lessons. Now you know why I begged you to buy such a big house. We get her a pony, give it its own bedroom. [telephone ringing] Hello? Oh, hi. It's Kendall Milestone. Oh, he's fine. The 22nd. No, I can't. Go. Please, go. I'm sorry. Thanks anyway. Give Millie our best. Right. Bye-bye. Got to get out of here one of these nights. Gonna get claustrophobia. You're gonna get spooked. I don't want to go any place without you. I married you to be with you. Who would believe I married the "Roamin' in the Gloamin'" type. Did you hear from the studio? Mmm, officially, they're on their fourth rewrite. Well, I--I think I'll have Pete repaint the hull of the Santana. How many more phony rewrites before... You, the kids... The house... Jokes, all of it. I love all of it. And I just can't stand watching it disappear before my eyes. [sobs] [cutlery clatters] You want some bacon? Sure. Well, how's it been going? [sighs] Rough. Very rough? Pretty rough, yeah. That says no improvement. I sneaked a look while she was out of the room. [knock on door] -It's me. -[Dr. Brandsma] Come in. [Betty] Now, listen, Spence just called. He and Katie would like to drop in for a cocktail on Wednesday. Now, with the Nevins coming today and John Huston tomorrow, and then we've got Adlai Steve... Listen, do you think we're overdoing this visitor a day caper? I've got at least a dozen other people who'd-- Take a walk, Betty. Who asked you to come busting in on a patient-doctor relationship? [Dr. Brandsma] It's all right. Just limit each visitor to one hour and our patient to one snort. [chuckles] I didn't realize I had so many friends. Never felt... very well liked. Ha! Of course, these are all freeloaders. We'll fix 'em, dear. I'll start watering their drinks. Oh, tell Spence and Katie to come on Thursday instead of Wednesday. I'm taking Steve for a sail on Wednesday. Now look, don't worry about it. Only be for the afternoon. I promised. [Dr. Brandsma] Seeing your friends in the den is one thing, but I can't let you out in the open, in the wind and the exposure. I can't take any chances on pneumonia. I'll tell Steve you'll take him when you get a little stronger. Now, listen, you guys... I've been in ratty jails like this before. You either spring me out of this joint on Wednesday, or I'll blow holes a yard wide in those fancy duds you're wearing. [coughing] Don't you understand? I promised my son I would take him sailing. All right, go ahead. Man is made of soft or hard wood. Your husband's made of very hard wood indeed. You know, he played a lot of tough guys in the movies. He used to make a big deal of being a tough guy in public. Those were all acts. But all through this ordeal, he's been the real tough guy. So have you. [soft instrumental music playing] How you doing, Steve? This is a gas, Daddy. You bet. When I was your age, my father taught me how to sail. Nothing better for a man than to learn to love and respect the sea. -Wanna take the wheel? -Sure. Steady as she goes. You like this ring, Steve? [Stephen] It's keen. My father gave it to me. Excuse me, skipper, take the remote station. It's KOU. Mrs. Bogart's calling. Hello, dear. Over. [Betty] Just wanted to say hello. That's all. Are you all right? Over. I'm fine. Just fine. And I love you a lot. Over. I love you too, darling. And I miss you. Let me talk to Pete, okay? Over. She wants to talk to you. [coughs] Hello, Mrs. Bogart. Over. Tell me truthfully now, Pete, how is he? And Steve? Over. [Pete] Oh, he's great. Just great. And the boy's fine. Over. Thank you, Pete. Thank you. Thank you. [voice breaking] Over and out. [sighing] Steve... if you ever have any doubts about... God... life in the hereafter... go sailing. It'll revive your faith. [soft instrumental music playing]
