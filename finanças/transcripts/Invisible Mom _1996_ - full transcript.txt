(dramatic music) (thundering) - [Skeeter] There's this game called Virtual Combat right? It's really cool. - [Josh] Really? - Yeah, it's rad. So what games have you seen? - Oh I saw this game called Mortal Ninjas or something like that. - Oh really was that cool? - Yeah, the guys like jump around chopping each other with big old swords-- - Hey there's Debbie Morrow. - [Debbie] Hi Josh. - Hi Debbie. - Hi. - How are you coming with your science assignment? If you want I can help you with your homework. - Come on Josh. - [Debbie] Well maybe. - You know science runs in our family. My dad works at the government lab. - Hey, how's it going today boys, huh? Mmm, who is this your girlfriend huh? This your girlfriend! Your girlfriend! - I don't have a girlfriend. - Yeah, never had one, never will huh. So what's your old man been up to? Build any monsters lately in the basement huh? (groaning) He's gonna build a big ship that's gonna go to Mars, well that's where he belongs huh. - [Josh] Ow! - Leave him alone Charlie. - Huh, what was that? Huy, what you say? Say it again. - Get lost! - Hey go back to Arkansas, lizard boy! Hey forget these guys come with me Debbie, I'll buy you a milkshake. - Bye Debbie. - [Skeeter] You in trouble again? - [Josh] Kinda, I didn't clean my room and I didn't make my bed. - So what's your dad working on now? A death ray. - Yeah, I wish I could use it on Johnny Thomas. - You wanna come over and play Virtual Combat? It's 32-bit. - No, I don't think my mom will let me. One more mistake and I'm grounded. - Okay, but if you want to come over, give me a call. - Okay. See you later. Mom, I'm home! - What are you doing? - Getting a cookie. - One! What happened to your face? - Nothing. (telephone ringing) - [Mom] Hello. (dog barking) - Hey, come here. Hey, hey Cosmo, how was your day? Yeah, you got it made. No mom to boss you around, no school, no homework. No Johnny Thomas. - Josh your backpack's on the counter. - See what I mean. - Cosmo, get down! Get down! (dog whining) Why don't you tell me what happened today? Okay, but you can't let those guys push you around Josh. You gotta stand up to 'em. - But he's bigger than I am. - Yeah, well, bullies usually are. They want a fair fight so they pick on kids they can win against. But you can't let 'em win. - But what if I get hurt? - Well this hurts doesn't it? Sweetie, if you don't stand up for yourself, you're gonna hurt more inside than you do outside. Look, if you're wrong admit it. Everybody's wrong sometimes and that's when you back down. But if you're right, got to stand up for yourself okay? Feel better? (doorbell rings) - Somebody at the door Mom. - Young man, is your mother at home? - Well-- - Thank you! Oh, there you are. - Mrs. Pringle, what can I do for you today? - It's about that thing in your backyard. - What were you doing in our backyard? - Oh, I was on a ladder cleaning out the rain gutters, I couldn't help but see. - (laughing) Of course not. Well I'm really sorry that that device offends you. Next time why don't you have your husband clean out the rain gutters. - I will take this up with the Homeowners Association. Hmmmph! - Hmmmph. - What a fruitcake. - Josh, remember to respect your elders, even if they are fruitcakes (laughs). (light music) - Earth to Griffin. Just what are we wasting our time on today Griffin? - Well, I uh. I have this formula that perfectly replicates the cellular code of any solid matter with a negative polarity. Um, well, here, watch. Now the fluid will act as a magnet. Right. There we go. See. - Interesting Griffin. - Very interesting Dr. Woorter. - Thank you sir. And I'm sure you can see the military applications of my inventions. (clearing throat) - Yes, Professor Griffin? - Did you have something to add Karl? - No, um, no, just something stuck in my throat. - Well, Doctor, this has been a very valuable presentation. - Thank you Colonel Cutter. - Jerry, call me Jerry. - Jerry. - [Mom] Then what happened? - Then he called him Jerry, like they were all friends or something. - When the colonel was gone did you give him a wedgie? - [Mom] Joshua. - It's your invention you ought to fight and get it back. - Josh, adults don't fight. Fighting only creates chaos. - Josh has a point honey. I mean you can't just let Dr. Woorter walk all over you. You've got to stand up for yourself. - What and lose my job! Honey, honey you just don't understand office politics do you? What I invent at the lab is the lab's property. They own it, they make the profits. - Well then invent something at home. I mean you have your own lab down in the basement, use it. - Well I still think you should have given him a wedgie. - Cosmo, you eat your own food and we'll eat our own food okay? - Hmmph, I can't believe the neighborhood association allows people like that to live around here. - [Mr. Pringle] Mmm hmmm. - No telling what that crackpot is doing in his basement. Maybe making a bomb. - Mmmm hmm. - If he blew up a bomb, can you imagine what that would do to property values around here. - Mmm hmmm. - Hmmmph, well if the Homeowners Association isn't going to do anything about him, we should go to City Hall. - Yes dear. - He's back down in that basement again. Probably doing something immoral. - Honey! Honey! - Mmm mmm. (light music) - Well Griffin. What are we wasting our time on today? - Nothing sir. - Nothing, that's nice. You know that automatic shaver you designed. - Yes sir. - Well it doesn't work! If you need me for anything, I'll be at lunch. (chuckling) - Honey, dinner's ready. - I'll just eat down here okay. - More sweet potatoes Josh? - Oh no Mom, I gotta go. - (sighing) Yes, and what a nice family dinner. Here you go. - Oh hi! I'll just eat that later. - Yeah, okay. - Yes! Looks good huh Cosmo? Cosmo, science dog (laughing). You wanna help daddy with an invention? Works by changing the cellular density of the, ah, you wouldn't understand would you? You're a dog! Are you a thirsty dog? It's non-toxic, biodegradable. Won't hurt you a bit, yeah. There you go, that's right Cosmo. Tastes good, huh. Yeah, yeah. Alright, flop number one. Science. - Herbert, that Griffin's going to blow up the neighborhood. - Mmm, anything you say dear. - Alright, that might do it. Here you go, want another drink? Yeah, you do, don't ya. Uh huh, yeah, ooh that tastes good. Hmmm. Nothing. (dog whining) Oh wow! Wow! (dog barking) No, stay! Stay! Cosmo! You are there aren't you Cosmo? Stay, stay. Don't! Stay! Stay! (dog whining) It's okay, come on now, it's alright. Good, good, good. There you go good girl. Now, Cosmo! Cosmo! We can't tell anyone about this yet. Oh no, no, no, no! Now you just don't go blabbing this around town okay! (dog barking) You're gonna have to be invisible for a few days and then I can patent the formula in my name and then I can use the lab at work to find the antidote. Till then, this is our little secret okay? (dog barking) Good girl! Yeah! - Cosmo! Cosmo! Hey Mom have you seen Cosmo? - Uh, no. - Well she's not in the back yard. - Maybe she's hiding. - I can't find her anywhere! - Well, wouldn't get upset about it. She didn't just up and disappear, she's around here somewhere. - Cosmo! Cosmo! - My mom is no one. Sometimes it feels that way. (dog panting) - I think Cosmo ran away. - Oh she's probably just out exploring. - Why would she leave? I was always nice to her. - Josh, she's around somewhere. - 'Cause I didn't play with her enough, isn't it. She was always bringing me her ball wanting me to play. But I didn't have time for her. I didn't make time for her and now she's gone. - She'll be back honey. Tired, smiling from her adventures, waiting for us to look the other way so she can snatch some food off the table. - I hope so. - (sighing) I hope so too. (music playing on TV) - [TV Character] How are they gonna protect themselves? - Handguns and rifles, that's all they'll have. (ominous music) (gunshots) - Is your room clean? - Mmm hmm. - Have you made your bed? - Mmm hmm. - Great, thanks. Don't forget to take the garbage out tonight. (gunshot) (lighthearted music) (dog whining) - Joshua! Josh! - Yes Mom. - Joshua Griffin, you are grounded for a week. - But Mom, there's a sci-fi double feature at the Elray theater this weekend. - Well I'm really sorry, but your room isn't clean. Your bed isn't made. - But, but I made my bed. - Josh! I'm sorry, but there will be no movie-going for you this weekend. And turn this TV off. When you finished that, can you set the table for me? - Yes Mom. (Mom gasping) (Dad laughing) - Oh my! Oh did we have a good day? - Yes, yes, my ship has come in. - Oh, it's not the Titanic is it? - What does your ship do? - Makes objects invisible. - Oh that's nice honey. - Imagine, imagine, invisible eye glasses. Invisible braces. Invisible bandages, invisible anything! Honey, honey we are gonna be rich. We're gonna get rid of the old station wagon of yours. We're gonna maybe move to a bigger house. Maybe take a vacation in Hawaii. - Oooh! (laughing) - What kind of vacation would it be without Cosmo. - Cosmo! The reason is that you haven't seen her for the last Week is because of my experiment. You see I tested the formula on her son and Cosmo is uh. I'll just show you, just show you. Cosmo, come here girl! (dog barking) Come on, come on. There she is. Formula works on dogs too. - Oh! Oh! (shrieking) Oh my goddess, honey, you're a genius. - You gave me the idea. - Well, can you bring her back. - Oh yeah, yeah sure, with an antidote. - Way to go dad. Hey I'll do the dishes later. Come on Cosmo! (screaming and laughing) (telephone ringing) - Morning Al. - So let me get this straight. Everyone in your family is totally jazzed 'cause your dad invented this invisibility stuff. - Right. - Cosmo's back but you still can't see her. - Right. - And you're still grounded! - Right! - Man, what I wouldn't give to be invisible. For just one day. - Well, well, well lookie here. It's lizard boy and his good friend Dweebo. Hey guess what Dweebo, your girlfriend, she's a little bent out of shape 'cause you didn't take her to the movie Saturday you know. - So? - So, I think I'm gonna have to take her. Maybe I'll give here a little kissing, ha, ha, ha. - This place is spooky. - Well here let me turn on the light. (Skeeter screams) - Geez, Skeeter, it's just a skeleton. I'm not too sure this is a good idea. - Come on Josh, it's the only way to sneak past your parents and save Debbie Morrow from that Thomas creep. - What if it hurts? - Did it hurt Cosmo? - Well, maybe we should try it on Ben. - No, not a good idea. - Well then, I'm not gonna drink it. - Fine, okay. (ominous music) - [Mom] Josh is that you? - My mom. - [Skeeter] Ben! Ben! Where'd he go? Where'd he go! - What are you doing down here? - I'm just showing Skeeter Dad's lab. - Well you know you're not supposed to be down here without your father's permission. - Yes Mom. - You know you're not supposed to have company over when you're grounded. - Yes Mom. - Sorry to run you off Skeeter. - It's okay Mrs. Griffin, I have lots of homework to do. - [Mom] What am I gonna do with you Josh? - Sorry Mom. - Go upstairs and do your homework. Thank you. (slow dramatic music) - I'm gonna be grounded for the rest of my life. (gasping) - What! Oh my gosh! Josh! Josh you get in here right this minute! I don't believe this. What is going on. Stay calm. Just wait till your father hears about this young man. Josh, what happened to me? - Uh, well. Uh Skeeter and I had this plan and-- - Josh, look at me! - I'm trying, but you're not there. - Okay, let's start with breaking into your father's lab. - Okay, I broke into the lab and borrowed some of dad's invisibility formula. - Joshua! - Okay, I stole some of the invisibility formula so that... and I put in the RC bottle and I guess you drank it. - Why? - Because you were thirsty. - Why did you steal the formula? - So, so I could sneak out of the house. See, 'cause this, 'cause this guy named Johnny Thomas he was gonna-- - Oh young man you wait till your father gets home! - Sorry mom. - Hi honey, I'm home. Honey? (Mom sobbing) Honey? What's wrong? - Look at me Karl, just look at me! - Hey, hey there's no reason to cry. I mean underneath all that stuff you're beautiful. - Underneath all this stuff I'm invisible! (sobbing) - What! - Josh broke into your lab and stole some of the formula and I drank it by mistake and now I'm invisible. - Oh my god! It works on people too. I mean this is so much more than I ever imagined. Tell me, how does it feel? Tingly? Is your vision blurred or is it darkened at all? - Karl! Am I gonna look like this forever? - Now did you say that Josh did this. - Yes and as soon as you give me the antidote I'm gonna kill him. - Honey, I don't know how to say this. - Say what! - There is no antidote. - What! - Not yet at least. - So? - So, so, I didn't have time to develop an antidote yet. - Yet! - Honey now you may have to remain invisible until I sell them the formula. - Hah! Forget it! - That's not gonna work for you is it? - Oh, this is ridiculous. Karl, you've got to find an antidote. If you have to sneak around to do it, sneak around. - Okay, okay, I'll just have to smuggle the formula in, make the antidote and hope that Dr. Woorter doesn't catch me. - Well that'll be easy. - It would be easier if I had a test subject so that I could make sure the antidote works. - What about Cosmo? (dog barking) - Cosmo's too big. I'm gonna have enough trouble getting the formula past Woorter without-- - Ben! Ben, Skeeter's lizard, he's invisible too. - Well, what have we got going here Griffin? - Oh, um, this is the a, my kinetic energy experiment that I have been working on. You know. - Oh well, now that you've brought it here, it's our property right? - Oh, of course. You know, but I need the computer to run a few equations then you can have the wheel for analysis. - Certainly, certainly. - Right. Okay, come on, come on. Yes, alright now, formulate the antidote. - The antidote to what Griffin? - My formula. - And just what does this new formula of ours do? Invisibility, hmmm. I feel a promotion coming on, for myself naturally. - Dr. Woorter, this is my formula. Now I developed this myself on my own time. - On your own time, but in our laboratory with our computer. - Well, not exactly. - You know that's grounds for dismissal. - No, Dr. Woorter, you don't understand. - Oh yes, I understand. And I think that I'm going to confiscate this for the good of mankind. And I don't think that sending this off right now is such a good idea. - You realize what would happen if this falls into the wrong... hands. Oh my god. - Get me security, fast. - Dr. Woorter! Dr. Woorter! You can't do this. - Sorry Griffin, but as of 3.07 this afternoon, you are barred from this lab for life. - You don't understand, my wife! - Oh yes, your wife. Well, looks like she's gonna have to find another job now huh? So will you for that matter. Can you say, would you like fries with your burger? - Dr. Woorter, please, I must have access to the lab. - Bye bye. - No! No! - Oh great, it's in code. It's alright, I can break it, I think. My new formula. - And just what do you think it does. - Well sir, imagine if you can, an invisible army capable of crossing enemy lines and attacking at will. Past guards, past surveillance cameras, without being seen. - Science fiction Doctor. - Science fact. - Empty cage, or is it? - Seems like some kind of trick to me. Empty cage with a motorized wheel. - It's no trick sir. It's an invisible lab specimen. I'm telling you, inside of this cage is an invisible... Something or other. - Something or other? - Sir, whoever owns this formula, is going to rule the world. - If you can prove this Doctor, you're gonna be a very, very rich man. Now as soon as you can get me a valid lab specimen, I'll show it to the boys in D.C. - What are you? A rat? (light music) - Mom, you home? Aaargh! - [Mom] Not until after dinner. - Mom, don't sneak up on me like that! - [Mom] Well don't sneak cookies like that. - Mom, you don't have any clothes on! Or at least I don't think you do. - [Mom] Is your bed made? - Mom, where are you? - [Mom] Watching your every move. (knocking) (knocking) - Hiya doing Griff? Go get your mommy, I'm collecting for the Tribune. - How much? - 12 bucks, plus a generous tip you little twerp. - Mom, it's the paper boy and he needs 12 dollars. - [Mom] My purse is on the coffee table. - Wait here. Mom, you've only got 10 dollars. - I'll take a check. Hey Griff, by the way, I'm taking that girl you like out to the movies Saturday night. Too bad you can't make it huh? (laughs) - She already had one filled out for you. - What and no tip. Hey that nose of yours is looking pretty good there huh. Ready for another pop! (laughs) Ow! Ow! Man, what is that? - Didn't I tell you I was telekinetic? - Huh? - I can move things with my mind. - Ow! What are you talking about? - It's one of my dad's experiments. You lay one hand on Debbie and I'll make your head explode. I can do it! - [Mom] Look at that boy run! - Thanks Mom! - [Mom] No sweat kiddo. Hi honey, did you get it? Did you find the answer? What's the matter? - I got fired. - [Mom] (gasps) You what? - Fired from the lab. No chemicals, no super computer. - No antidote. - Dr. Woorter confiscated the formula and barred me from the lab. - Karl, I can't stay invisible forever! - I don't know what to do. - Oh. - Something is wrong Herbert. - Yes dear. - I haven't seen Laura Griffin all day and goodness knows I've been looking. It's as though she's just up and disappeared. (sad music) - Dad, you can't let those guys push you around. You've got to stand up for yourself. - He's my boss Josh. He's more important than I am. - But he didn't invent the formula, you did. You're the genius dad. He may be your boss but you're smarter than he is. You can't let him win. - He fired me! It's over! I lost! - You can't give up just because you're hurt. You've got to keep going. If you don't stand up for yourself, you'll be hurt on the inside as well as on the outside. It's your formula Dad. You have the right to break into the lab and get it back. If you find out the antidote in the process it's even better. - You make it sound easy. - It will be. We've got to take the chance. - I've still got my keys. They're closed on Saturday. If I can get past the guard at the desk. - We can do it. We've got to get Mom back to normal. - [Security Guard] Dr. Griffin, what are you doing back? - We're here to clean out my desk. - Mmm hmm. - Just be cool. Right here. (tense music) Alright, here we go. - This is a pretty cool place Dad. - Thanks. We got to hurry though. (telephone ringing) - Woorter here. No I didn't give Griffin permission to collect his things. How long has he been there? No, no, no, don't call the police. I'll take care of this myself. - Alright, alright, this better work. Now this I believe is the ingredient that we were missing. Yeah, yeah. Huh. - Let's try that on Ben. - Let's try. Here you go Ben. There you go. I've learned a valuable lesson son. I should have thought before I acted. Once Mom's back I'm gonna destroy the formula. Shred every trace, it's just too dangerous. The world's not ready yet. Look what it's done to us. - It's okay, you didn't know Dad. - Maybe I should have. (dreamy music) Yes, yes! It works! It works! - Mom's gonna be okay. - [Dr. Woorter] I'm so happy to hear that. - Run! Run! (fast paced music) - Restrain him will you, he just ruined my experiment. - Dr. Woorter, Dr. Woorter, I can explain. My wife has disappeared. I have to get her back. - Your wife disappeared? - [Dad] Yes. - And so that made you break into my lab. - Yes! I needed certain chemicals to make an antidote to bring her back. She's invisible. - Invisible! Did you hear that? I believe he said that she's invisible. I think that you'd better call the state mental hospital and have them come and get Prof. Griffin. - My god, didn't you just hear me? My wife is at home, she's there waiting for me. She's invisible. You can't do this. - So, you decided to try this experiment on your wife? - Look, just let me go. Let me go Woorter and I'll split the formula with you. - Oh, there's no reason to do that. You see Griffin, once the competency hearing finds you mentally unstable. Well, they're gonna lock you up for life. Then the formula will be mine, all mine. Take him away. So, that's who you are. - Listen, you've got to let me out of here. My dad isn't crazy, my mom really is invisible. It's my fault really. I'm the one who gave her my dad's formula. Look, my dad isn't crazy. You believe me don't you. - Aha, you got him huh? Well dementia seems to run in the family. Better get a child custody officer here to take care of little Joshua. Put him in a home for disturbed little children. As for you Griffin, I see basket-weaving in your future. Lots and lots of basket-weaving. - Didn't you hear what I said. YOu've got to believe me I'm not crazy. My wife is really invisible, really. Let me out. Help! Somebody help! No! No! You don't understand. I'm the only one who knows how to help her. (yelling) Help! Help me! - Rats. The only proof that the formula really works, ruined. Thanks a lot pal. All I need now is just another invisible specimen. Yeah, something that would sway the joint chiefs to pay me twice what I want. What? Wait a minute. The mother, Mrs. Griffin. Of course! (ominous music) There, she'll never know the difference. Perfect. - [Mom] Gosh you guys it's after five o'clock. Where are you? You said you wouldn't be this late. - [Josh] Well don't I at least get a phone call. - [Woman] Alright but make it quick. (telephone ringing) - [Mom] Oh finally, this has got to be them. Hello. - Mom. - [Mom] Where are you, are you okay? - Well we ran into a little trouble at the lab. Dr. Woorter caught us. They put me in this orphanage. - [Mom] Orphanage! - Yeah, until the hearing. - [Mom] What hearing? - Dad's sanity hearing. They've got him in the loony bin. - [Mom] What! - Dr. Woorter convinced them that he's crazy because he thinks that you're invisible. - [Mom] Well, where is this hearing. - No Mom, you can't go there. Dad thinks the formula is too dangerous. You can't let anybody know that the invisibility works. - [Mom] What else can I do? - Well Dad's hearing's on Monday morning nine o'clock sharp. You gotta think of something. - [Mom] I will. - That's enough. - Just a minute. - [Mom] Josh! Josh! - Mom. - [Mom] Yeah? - I love you. - [Mom] I love you too. - Alright, come with me. - [Mom] Alright, Laura, stay calm. Stay calm and you can get everything straightened out. (mumbling) Poor Karl, he must be so upset. What could be keeping that cab. I have to get to the lab before Prof. Woorter gets there. If I can just get to Karl's lab, I can find the antidote for this somewhere. I can't believe it's taking that cab so long. Oh, my gosh I'm gonna die in this outfit. Must be 100 degrees. Josh, I never wanted this to happen to him. Don't worry family, Mom will pull through. (lighthearted music) (taxi hooting) At last. - Where to lady? - Applied Technologies lab. - [Driver] Want me to step on it? - Here's a twenty, it should cover the fare and your tip. - You feeling okay lady? - Just get going. - Okay. Here you go lady, safe and sound. - Thank goodness, I could not have stayed inside these clothes one more minute. It's pretty hot in here, you know that. Just got to get these things off. Then I got to get in, I've got to get past the guards without being seen. When I find that Dr. Woorter, what he did to me I'm gonna give him one swift kick in the. I don't believe I'm taking my clothes off in public. Broad daylight. Excuse me, what are you looking at buddy! Thanks for the ride. - Have a nice day. - [Mom] You too. - Before we make a presentation to the joint chiefs I need proof Woorter, solid proof. - Oh you'll have your proof sir. Just as soon as I can secure a specimen for my show and tell presentation. - And just how long do you think it will take you to secure this specimen? - [Mom] Excuse me. - I think that I'll have one very soon sir, very soon. - [Mom] I know the antidote must be around here somewhere. Oh, hi Ben. Where could it be? What does it look like? Oh! That's not it. Maybe over here. Wait a minute, that's it! (shrieking) Help! Help! Let me out of here! Let me out! - Well, good evening Mrs. Griffin. Nice to see you, or not to see you as the case may be. - [Mom] Let me go! - I wish you'd stop struggling so much though. I'm afraid you might hurt yourself. - [Mom] Let me go! - Oh, I'm afraid I can't do that. You see Mrs. Griffin. Well you are dramatic proof that the invisible formula really works on humans. Now, after your poor husband is found mentally unstable and committed to an asylum. I will use you as part of my presentation in Washington. You will help me to sell the formula to the government for millions. - [Mom] I won't help you Woorter. - Oh yes, I think you will Mrs. Griffin. You see, well if you co-operate, well then I will supply you with the antidote, which you came so close to. And also your husband and your son will be released. Now if you choose not to co-operate. Oh dear, I sure hate to see families separated but I'm sure that you understand that business is business. - [Mom] You promise you'll release my husband and son. - Scout's honor. Just stay quiet until we get to Washington, alright. Now, if you'll excuse me, I will go and prepare your room for the trip. Well, I hope you'll like your room Mrs. Griffin. - [Mom] Oh it's swell, real swell. Just, remember to keep your mouth shut until we get to Washington D.C. huh. - [Mom] I heard you the first time. - Anything you say can jeopardize the future well-being of your family. - [Mom] I know that. - Oh, here's something to think about. - [Mom] Ow! You're not gonna get away with this Woorter. (lightning crashes) - What are you thinking about? - My mom. - I used to think that having a mom was the worst thing in the whole world. Even worse than head-lice. But then my mom went away, never came back. - I'm sorry. - It's okay. What happened to your mom? - I don't know. - You should get some sleep. (sad music) (lightning crashes) - [Mom] Hey guys, I'm sorry I let you down. I promise we'll be a family again really soon. I love you. (crying) - I can't sleep. I'm worried about my wife and my son. Funny, I haven't worried about them in a long time. I'm usually busy doing unimportant things. Now it may be too late. (crying) - [Mom] Oh I don't want to go to Washington. - Well Lenny, this is the one. Come on let's get it on the truck. It's almost nine a.m. - [Mom] Nine a.m! - I heard you the first time. - I didn't say anything. I gotta get some sleep. Come on. - Geez, this thing's heavy. - It must weigh a ton. - [Mom] Excuse me, I don't weigh an ounce over 112. - Did you hear that? - Nothing in there, but a picture. - [Mom] Hey, no peeking. - Smitty! - [Mom] Sleep tight. Sorry guys, but sometimes a mom's got to play a little tough. - Morning, sleep well? - Listen, you have no reason to keep me here. I am not insane. - Ah, that's what they all say. - [Dad] But I'm not like the others, I really am sane. - That's what the hearing's for. - To prove I'm sane. - No, to prove that you belong here. Come on, haven't got all day. - Oh sir, sir, I think that in the interests of national security that we shouldn't mention the invisibility formula at this hearing. - Well at this point, I'm not sure there is such a thing. - Oh yeah, there is, there is! Wait till you see the new specimen I have. - The board acknowledges Colonel Cutter. - Well Professor Griffin was always a strange bird. Not exactly the kind of man you would expect to find in the army. Men like me, strong, courageous, with a love for dressing up in uniform. A love for living with other men. In other words, he was not what you would call a man's man. - Like yourself Colonel. - Well thank you ma'am. Yes exactly. He was always cowering in the corner during briefings. Strange bird. - I see, is that all? - I think that about covers the situation ma'am yes. - Thank you. - Is there a Mrs. Pringle present. - Oh, yes I'm right here your honor. - I'm not a judge, I am a doctor. I understand you have some information to share with us. - Yes, your honor. - Mrs. Pringle please take the stand. - Professor Griffin and his wife and son have lived across the street from me for 11 years. If you ask me, he was never quite sane. And then, suddenly last week, his wife disappeared. Hmmph, just up and vanished. I think he killed her and cut her up in pieces and buried them all over the back yard. I bet if you would get some men with shovels they could dig her up. - Thank you, that will be enough. - Hey son. - Don't worry, you're gonna get out of this. - I know, I know. - Hey buddy, keep your distance. This guy's a psycho. - He's my dad! - Just keep your distance. - [Doctor] Professor Griffin please. - Good luck. - My name is Karl Jackson Griffin and there has been a mistake made. As a research scientist for Applied Technologies Laboratory I created an invisibility formula. Then, due to a mistake, my wife Laura, drank some of the formula and she became invisible. And then Dr. Woorter stole the invisibility formula and he fired me. When I attempted to break into the lab to create an antidote so that my wife could be seen again, Dr. Woorter had me arrested. Here I am now. Dr. Woorter is the one who should be on trial for stealing my formula. - This is not a trial, it is a hearing. - Okay, then hear this. I love my wife and I love my son. I love my family and I also love my job. And I won't go on working with disreputable people like Dr. Woorter, who steal the work of others and claim it as their own. That's enough to drive anybody a little crazy. For years, I did nothing. I let him steal from me, afraid that he would fire me. Well I, I can't do that anymore. I am not gonna let bullies like Dr. Woorter push me around, claim that he invented my formula and say that I am crazy. Dr. Woorter is a thief. He's the one who should be on trial, not me. - This is not a trial. It's a hearing. Thank you Dr. Griffin, you may take a seat. So let's hear what Dr. Woorter has to say. - Well first of all, let me assure you that I'm no thief. Now, I'm sorry to have to be the one to say this but Professor Griffin has clearly lost his mind. I mean invisibility, come on. We all know that there's no such thing as an invisibility formula. And as for his wife being invisible. She disappeared all right, she took off! I mean otherwise she would be here. And as you can plainly see-- (slapping) She's not. - Glad you could make it sweetheart. - Oh it's a little warm in here. Now, seems to me that Professor Griffin should not be allowed to interact with fellow human beings like myself. (grunting) Stop that! Stop that immediately. Stop that! Excuse me. Furthermore, I believe that Professor Griffin should be committed to the state mental health facility because-- (giggling) Stop that tickling! Stop that! - Do you see anybody? - No, of course not. Do you? - Man's obviously crazy. - That's not true, I'm not crazy. It's her, don't you understand. Can't you see? Of course you can't see. That's because she's invisible. But believe me she's there. She's the one that made me pick my nose, she slapped me. She's been tickling-- (yelling) She's trying to make me look crazy. I'm not, I'm not crazy. - That's what they all say. (Woorter yelling) - Everybody wave your arms around. You'll hit her, you'll hit her. I'm telling you I'm not crazy. - I'd say that this hearing is over. Professor Griffin, you're free to go. And I'd like to see a full report on Dr. Woorter tomorrow morning. See that he doesn't hurt himself. - Honey! Honey? - Professor Griffin. It looks like we're gonna have a vacancy at Applied Technologies. - You want me to take my old job back after this? - No I wouldn't think of giving you your old job back. How would you like Dr. Woorter's job? - What? - What we're looking for is a leader. A man who isn't afraid to stand up for himself. So do you want the job? - Yeah. I mean, yes sir. And there are gonna be some big changes around here and I have got plenty of ideas Colonel. - Jerry, call me Jerry. And if I were you I'd take that wife of yours out and celebrate tonight. I don't think you would've gotten out of this without her. - Oh you're right. You know if it's not too much trouble, have the invisibility antidote sent over from the lab. - I'll do that right away sir. - Well, congratulations neighbors. Oh! Why I never. Hmmph. - [Mom] Oh, I've wanted to do that for so long. - There you are. So, where to now? - [Mom] Home! - You are some woman. - [Mom] You wouldn't believe what happened to me. I got locked in a cage and had to beat up two guys to get here. - Oh I wish I could see the expression on your face. - [Mom] I wish I could just see my face. - Hey Dad, this just came by messenger. - The antidote. - [Mom] Oh thank God. - I can't wait to see you. How I have missed you. Okay honey. - I've missed me too. - Here we go. Don't spill any. - [Mom] Did I get the right one? It tastes like water. - Nothing happened, I? - You mean it doesn't work. (mom groans) - We're gonna figure out something son. If I have to get the team at the lab to work on it, they're gonna work on it night and day until we find an antidote. Sorry Laura, I'm so sorry. (mom moaning) (dog panting) - Hey Cosmo, what are you doing? Sit, sit. Oh hey, I used to think you had it made. No mom to boss you around, no chores, no homework. What am I gonna do Cosmo? Hey? C-- Mom, Dad, come quick. Cosmo, Cosmo I can see you. - [Mom] What is it? - Look. - [Mom] She's visible. - How did it happen, what did you do to her? - Nothing, she was like this whenever she came in. - [Mom] Karl, does this mean that the formula just wears off? - No I don't think so. It has to be a chemical reaction to something that she ate or drank. - Something in the house. - [Mom] Like what? - Let's look. - [Mom] Hurry Karl. - Let's just go through everything. - [Mom] What are we supposed to be looking for. Nothing out of order here. There's nothing in here. What? - Honey. - [Mom] Yeah? - The dog food. - [Mom] You want me to eat dog food. - Yes, yes, Cosmo did. Maybe there's something in it, some chemical additive or preservative. You know, we won't know unless you try. (Mom sighing) - [Mom] Blech! How can you eat this stuff Cosmo, ech. Well, is anything happening. - No, I guess it's not the dog food. Keep searching. - [Mom] Great. (slurping) Anything? - Guess it's not the water. - [Mom] I'm not going to drink out of the toilet. I don't care if it will make me visible. - Course not. - [Mom] And I'm not gonna bite fleas. - Oh no, no, I wouldn't have you do that. But what else does Cosmo eat? - [Mom] Besides dog food. Table scraps when no-one's looking. - Table scraps! I'll be right back. - [Mom] Wait, Karl, where are you going? - Dad what's the hurry? - I've got it. - Oh yeah. - Now go get your mother, she's over by the refrigerator tell her to lay down by the sofa. You ate this, you drank this didn't you? - [Mom] Josh, what is your father doing down in the lab? - Don't worry Mom, Dad's got an idea. - [Mom] I hope it's a good one. - Okay, I've found it. It's a version of the formula that didn't work. My equation was off by 2%. - [Mom] So? - So, that 2% is the difference between the formula and the antidote. See, I put the beaker next to my dinner in the basement. When Cosmo tried to get the food, she knocked over the beaker, drank some of the liquid, now she's visible. - Is there enough left for Mom? - Gosh I hope so. Well, let's go. (gulping) Okay, now we wait. - [Mom] I feel funny, all tingly. (dreamy music) - Gross. - Look at that, amazing! - How do I look without makeup? - Simply beautiful. - Mom, I can see you. Don't ever disappear again okay? - Okay. - (laughing) That goes for me too. - Okay, but no more nutty experiments. - Oh, but I was working on this experimental growth formula that you can do on a baby chick, makes them grow to the size of a house. - Karl! - I threw it out in the trash, don't worry about it. (strange barking) - [All] Cosmo? (lively music)
