Faster, hurry up! -Come on, hurry. You drive me crazy. Now stop it. Quiet. I'll stop the bus. Shut up. Drive faster, hurry. -Use your right foot, man. Calm down, damn you. What's this? How about starting the car? Do you know them all? "She walks away and looks back one last time." What's this? It's a story... ...for a film. You want a drink? It's a love story? Why can't I read it? It isn't finished yet. As long as it's a happy ending. No misery... As long as it isn't sad, ending badly. Sad? -Someone dying, you know. It's terrible when someone dies. You can make up the ending. If you don't want a sad ending, think up a happy one. Duska! Bob! Duska! Bye. I'm so glad to see you. Coffee? Caf?? Coffee! Bob... Duska! There we are. Cookie? You want one? Cookie. There we are!

Our festival "the Festival of Festivals" is drawing to a close, We just saw the last film in competition. I want to mention the films nominated at our festival one more time. All these films of course deserve the first prize. But our respected jury chose the finest of the fine, the best of the best. And these stunningly beautiful artistically correct prizes... ...will be given to their rightfull recipients. I want to ask the wonderful actors to come on stage... ...the ones we just saw on the silver screen. Please give them a hearty applause. Ruslana Fildovna. Victoria Rybakova. There isn't room for everyone. Please... What did I say? The bus isn't made of elastic! The shockbreakers won't take it. If anything happens, it's your fault. -That's just fine! If the suspension breaks... -Nothing'll break. Get moving. The tires could collapse. -No way. It'll all be fine. What did I say? It's all fine. -If only we were there. No problem. Good evening...

There we are. Bob, coffee. Igor. Igor? Igrovicz! My little mother. His name is Duska. Duska is a Russian. Can you translate him? Old mate... Duska means darling. He wants to know who Duska is and why he's here. And who are you? Bob. Bob? Igor understands everything. Duska says: Bob is a friend. That's why he's here. Ask when he's leaving. Duska says: don't worry! Duska won't leave. Bob not alone. Bob, don't worry. Duska stays as long as Bob likes. Duska won't desert Bob. Igor drink to friendship. Life, just like a leaky boat at sea... ...slowly filling up. Now we drink to today. Today we live. Tomorrow dead. you bow your head to the side of the fence across the road and across the broad river is just as lonely a tall, tall oak I'm staying here. Who's the sorbet for? Duska. Bob, coffee? There we are.
