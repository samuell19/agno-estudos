-Hi! -Hi! -What a beautiful wedding! -Yeah, it is. Could you give this to the groom? From his wife. I promise I'll reward you with some nice pictures... -Oh, yeah? How nice? -You'll see... Can't wait any longer. Meet me in the bedroom. In 15. Pants off. Your wife Welcome! Thank you for coming! -Oh, no! -Oh, yes! -Oh, no, you don't! -Oh, but yes, I do! I'm so hot from hiding inside that closet. Touch me! You're completely insane! Look, it's over between us. Can't you understand I finally found a normal girl... I had to find out from the tabloids that Mr. Minister is marrying his daughter to you, my dear beloved teacher? That's not the issue here... -Well, then what is the issue?! -We love each other. That's enough for me to... It has nothing to do with money. Her father might as well be a tractor driver. I would have married her anyway. Marriage is merely... A confirmation? Somebody's at the door! Get in there! -I don't want to! -Now! Move, come on! There's no one in here. Pew! Smells like shit in here! What the fuck is this? A sacrificial altar?! Rich girls get to be fucked with rose petals up their asses. Didn't you know? Give it to me. It's my turn, c'mon! Listen, bitch... Did you notice that weird photographer snooping around here? Oh, I thought it was just me! I'm so wasted. No, he really is sneaking around. Maybe he's with the fuckin' secret services. Hands off! Thank God this bitch finally found someone to marry. I didn't think there were any fools left. After last year's shit, even her father couldn't have helped her. Well, what can you do, the princess got jealous. She went after them and set their tent on fire. -And they were inside. -And he was inside her... Hey, love, do you want some too? Take a puff! They spent like three weeks in the hospital, didn't they? -This one seems like a nice guy, right? -Yeah... Maybe... He's a wimp if you ask me. This smell is killing me. I can't breathe. -No more of this strong stuff for you. -Smells like someone took a dump. -Wait! -Come on already! -Let's go take a selfie! -OK. You can put that ugly skunk of yours in here, not me. OK. Now please leave. -I'm not leaving without you. -You're totally insane. -Am I now? -Yes, you are. CHEATED ON ON HER WEDDING DAY CAUGHT HAVING AN AFFAIR WITH HIS STUDENT HOT PURSUIT I'll get you for this, you slut! Wait! Open this fucking door! I'm gonna fuckin' kill you, you slut! You slut, I'm gonna kill you! Check this one out! Upper class hoe with black lipstick. Black belt in blowjobs, can't you tell?! Hey, fellas, which one of you is Rãzvan? I'm Niculae, we talked on the phone about the weed... Wow, keep it down! Sorry, I didn't realize anyone was... I'd like a kilo or even one and a half, you know. How much? A kilo for starters, you know, in case I don't get the recipe right. -Seven, tops! -Seven what? -Grams. -Grams?! Are you selling gold?! I'm not here to make earrings. Come on! I'm paying you up front. -This guy's crazy. -How did you get our number? From Cecilia, who else?! You know Cecilia, right? OK, grandpa, it's either seven or you can cook yourself some of those zucchinis. Oh, now I get it. Just like back in the old days when you had to show your ID to get your ration. OK, now I get it. That's funny. Listen, I got the money right here. Nice and tidy. -All of it. -What? -I'm sorry. -Slip it in our pocket... discreetly. -Just like at the doctor's. -Now I get it. -Just like at the doctor's. It's 420. -I got what you're saying. -This pocket right here? -Yeah. You don't see a thing. I'm not giving you anything. Oops! Look... there! Just a second, I got to take this. Yes? Hi, Vasile. Thank you for... Yeah, look, I can't really talk now. I'm buying some weed from these fellas. Just for necessities, you know. Hey! Where the hell are you going? Come on! Where's the weed? I have to call you back, OK? Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday! It's your birthday and tonight it's all about you... Scent of a Woman! Not that again! I thought we already talked that through. I mean the film. What's funny? The film's funny. How can a blind dude speed drive a Ferrari?! Are you making fun of me? Is it that dangerous time of the month? So tell me again, why do you smell like women's perfume? It's a different woman every day. Isn't it obvious?! It's because I'm banging the entire neighborhood. Every day I'm with a different woman and that's why. I'm messing with you. I told you I do tricks in kindergarten with the kids. My colleagues have all sorts of perfumes with them. How many times do I have to ask you to tidy up a little bit around here? Did you even wipe the bathroom floor dry? Beware! Someone's been riding the cotton pony! I don't think you've ever cleaned the cat's litter box either. My dear sweet baby... I love you. Come on! "Descend to me, kind Evening star!" Let me go! Let go of me, you idiot! Let's finish what we started, we'll put ice on it afterwards. Let me go! George! Oh, come on, I don't even get a kiss on the cheek? What do you think about all this? Are you ignoring me? Are you? You're ugly as fuck. Asshole! How many times did I tell you to wipe the bathroom floor? Stop before this gets nasty! Oh, yeah? Get down on your knees and clean it up! Now! I said now! I'm sorry, I'm really sorry. It was an accident. How dare you hit me? I think I'm gonna be sick. Are you fucking kidding me? You throw this shit on me and now you're the victim?! How's that? You never do anything around here! You think I'm your fucking slave? I know it's your B-day and I've been as nice as I could. You've been nagging me with this women's perfume shit. You won't stop. Yada, yada, yada! You're driving me fucking insane. If you... -Let me finish, OK? -No, not OK. Mommy, please, can you get me into Acting School? I'm so good. -How the fuck do you know this shit? -How'd you get into Acting School, huh? I took the exam! Do you think my mom has money to get me into Acting School? -I know her connections! -What fucking connections? -You're not fooling me. -Tell me what connections? -What connections? -I know who and how she got you in. I can't believe you're saying this about me. -I rehearsed and I practiced. -Practiced what? You've only seen like four films and two cartoons in your entire life. Now you think you're Tarantino. I mean, come on! I hate you and I'm leaving you. I took the cat. She hates you too. Dragos Teglas: Great! Can I take you out for a drink? It's difficult to be an adult in Romania without losing your imagination... Hello? I wanted to watch "Scent of a Woman..." -What's up? -He always smells like... ...like another woman. I don't know what I'm going to do. I want to go out, to get wasted. -OK, I'm coming to pick you up. -I've had enough. I hate him! I don't give a shit. I just want to have some fun. -I'll be there in a few hours, OK? Bye! -He doesn't even love my cat. Ana, I proudly present ECHO ONE. I thought about naming it Ana, but... ...there can only be one Ana in my life. I wanted to thank you for believing in me. Actually, you were the only one who believed in me. I was thinking we could celebrate. You want to come over? Get a better look at it... My dad's home... Why is he always home? He's been acting strange lately... He's always babbling about tea... ...energies, karma. You could run out the window... ...if you wanted to... Until we meet again... ...I'll give you something to think about. I like what I see. And what do I get? -What are you doing there? -Dad?! Wait! I'm changing. -What are you watching? -Dad, don't come in! -What are you watching? -Ana? -You really lost some weight! I like it! -Really? -You look sexy! -Only now you've noticed? -Are we having this conversation again? -You do look sexy! Seriously, girls, do you think these braces make me look weird? -What?! -You think it's cool? -Braces are so sexy! -They are, right?! Men love it, believe me. I don't get it. What's so bad about wearing braces?! I was OK even with the fact that you were a little chubby, but now you have those wires in your mouth. Heavy metal smile, like living with fucking Terminator. Did Magi say anything about it? No, I mean I would've dumped his ass if he did. -Jeez, he's such a deadbeat. -Exactly! What's his problem anyway? How are my Indians doing? It's ready! What's up? -Dude, are you OK? -I just got scammed. They conned me. The land from Târgoviste, where Grandpa was growing cabbage... ...the Turks were supposed to "grow" a mall there. But they conned me with the paperwork and vanished with the money... ...and my European future. I only have a few bucks left in my account. Where are the girls? They're out downtown. Sorry, sorry, a million times sorry. He got my socks wet and he put my cat in the toilet bowl. -Do you want to give her a bath? -What?! Little kitty needs a bath. In the toilet bowl, of course. Hey! If you lay one finger on my cat... Oops... it fell! God, you're so dumb! We didn't break up because of that. But because he started laughing like an asshole during my favorite scene from Scent of a Woman. -We started fighting and shit happened. -Calm down. She set his clothes on fire. I would have given her one hell of a beating. Roxi, are you fucking crazy? Fuck this shit! You want this place to catch fire? Are you really fucking insane? -Do you want the both of us to burn? -Are you an idiot? Alright then, let's fucking burn down this place. See?! This is your film, right here. Why don't we just pour water on the light bulbs and the fucking sockets?! -You're out of your mind. -I'm out of my mind?! These were my flowers. My only birthday present. I got my socks wet again because of you. Have a bitch burn my stuff?! I'd beat the shit out of her! It's not like she bought me that shit. Hush, hush. Everything's gonna be alright. He's cheating on me. Magi loves you. Will the both of you just cut it out already? You're fucking retarded. Honey, he's a magician. He pulls scarves out of his ass for a living. -Forget about him already. -But I love him. You can do so much better than him. -I can, right? -Of course you can. I'm too good for him. He's an idiot. -Are you with me now? -Yes. -Yes! -That's it, girl! We're gonna get drunk. Really drunk! -To being free! -To being free! To you guys! Are we men or what? Look at us! We're in here playing computer games with toy tanks. -You know what we should do? -Get drunk?! No, even better, let's take our tanks out for a spin! To a brothel! Dude, you're not a real man unless you've been to a brothel at least once in your life. -Shut up! -And you just haven't been to one yet. I'm in. Me too. Look, I don't mean to spoil your fun, but some of us have a girlfriend. Real men pay for sex because they have the money for it. They have power. Money, power and women at your feet. Wait a minute, weren't you complaining about not having any money? I meant your money. The money you made with the perfumes, you know. What are you saving that money for? Let's put it to good use: hos. C'mon, bros, forget better supremacy! Is this guy suggesting we use my money to pay for hookers? I'll show you how a real life 3D woman looks like. Ana! What's the most hardcore thing you've ever done with Brain? I choose dare. We're playing truth or truth over here. I can't talk about it... It stays between me and him. Come on, you're only telling us. We're your best friends. You guys had sex, right? Yes... -Really? -You know what that is, right? It's when a little bee lands on a beautiful flower. It's when a man loves a woman. When a man loves a woman, he respects her, he protects her, and he makes love to her. He keeps her secrets. And she keeps his. Well, fuck me. You girls are going to give birth to angels. Real life angels. Why did she leave me? Who left you? -Go fuck yourself! -I was just joking! Why are you pissed? -This is what you call a joke? -Don't worry. She'll be back in no time. -We'll go out for a juice. -You just need to do some push-ups. Then she'll realize what a great guy you are. -Then she'll be like... The magic is back. -How do you know? That she's coming back? -Of course she's coming back. -Are you kidding me? Roxi? -Well done, Ana! -Oh, shut up! Just put a lid on it, OK? He stopped loving me because I have braces now. That's why! No one is ever going to love me again. It's never going to be like in The Notebook. I'm going to end up married to an old communist fart, just like my mother. Sorry. I don't want that, I want The Notebook. Everything's gonna be alright. You have us. Roxi. You can come live with me. It's gonna be just the two of us and you can have as many cats as you want. No, I don't want to be a crazy cat lady forever alone... I don't want that... I want to get married! Then get married! It's super easy! Every idiot wants to get married nowadays. Seriously! There are waiting lists in every city. That's not the point here! And it's not that easy at all! Oh, yeah? I imagine for you it would be quite hard... You're right. -Really? -Yeah. Bogdan would marry me in the blink of an eye. I actually have someone who truly loves me. -Oh, shut up already! -You shut up! Roxi... Trust me, anyone would want to marry us. We're the ones who must be picky. -Magi doesn't want me. -Yes, he does. You wanna bet? We'll get married tomorrow. Tomorrow? What's it gonna be? Room, hourly rate? Long, short? Are you together? No, separately! Lookie here, you even got a rocket! We're open to all sorts of things around here. Hey, deadbeats, do you even have any money on you? We want three beautiful matching girls. And how are you gonna pay for them? Cash, credit or food coupons? Well... Cash! Show us the money! Magi... How much is it? -Give them the money. -Easy, Elvis. -I'm just asking... -Do students get a discount? -They get... a receipt. -Right, a receipt. Luckily, I have my student card with me. Money up front! Wanna bet? Let's see who can get married in three days' time! That's about enough time to find a decent dress. You're a real genius! This is worse than going to the seaside two days before our finals. -Give me a break! -You're an irresponsible brat! Refresh my memory, how was it that you met this guy who loves you? What are we betting on? Anything, you name it! All in! All our personal belongings. -That's not enough. If you lose... -Yes... ...you have to go back to college and get your degree. -Oops! -OK. And you have to move out of your dad's place. And you, Roxi... have to delete your Facebook account. No... No way! Sister! Come on, I'm risking a three-year college sentence over here. -No! -Oh, yes! Alright already, it's a deal. Come on! Come on, Ana! Roxi, start filming! Today... I, Yasmine, Roxana and Ana hereby... Roxi, I'm only doing this for you. I don't want you to be alone with this crazy bitch. We swear on our souls and on all our personal belongings. I swear to respect my sister's pact. I want to be independent. We swear to get married in three days. My life is like a film and it's worth filming! I pledge to give up all my personal belongings and to move out of my dad's place. I would like to add that we're not allowed to pay men to marry us. Fuck you! Congratulations on our wedding! I found the perfect wedding dress! Is this your toy? Don't be so shy, honey! There we go. I think I got WI-FI. I want to show you how this chick is holding her legs. I named it "selfie69." I never asked her for a single thing, but she, on the other hand, has an entire list of things for me to do. And don't get me started on the things I'm not supposed to do... And I just don't get that freaking cat of hers. You fall in love with a girl and the cat is part of the deal. OK, seems to be a good cat, you take care of it, you feed it, but it's like nothing else matters to her except that cat. And how does that make you feel? It makes me feel kinda... Never mind, I'll be fine. Don't tell me you're a virgin. Is it your first time? I'll help you build up some courage. We just need a little music. Sorry, I must go. Why, you got scared? Why did you get scared? I can be either a boy or a girl. What's your pleasure? You're a nice guy. Don't let a cat or anything else get to you. Thank you, but... These small things don't really matter. It's the big things that matter. Like love. Do you love this girl or what? -Yes, of course I do... -So what's the problem? A cat? Or I got it wrong? Go tell her you love her. Be a brave man! Tell her what you feel. That's all that matters. -Have you ever been in love? -What? Have you ever been in love? So you have. So what did you do with the cat? Shut the fuck up! Only I get to scream. It's official! BEST BET EVER! I really need to teach you girls some poker. Have you lost it? You didn't kiss her, right? Did you? Wait, I don't even want to know. Dude... I can't find my wallet. Is that Mihai? Is that... That fucking idiot! What the fuck? Not in there. Be careful, my rocket! -Move it, come on! Drive! -Hey! Where do you think you're going with my girl? She's a rental, it's not like you bought her. Elvis, Turnip! -Careful with my rocket! -I don't give a fuck about your rocket. Move it! They've taken our girl. Elvis, this ain't no laughing-matter! Faster, faster! Come on! Drive faster, come on! They're onto us! -You gotta be kiddin' me! -Faster! Are you running from me? The nerve of these deadbeat losers. I don't care if it's red or yellow, just drive! If I lose Iuliana, you bitches are gonna take her place. -Hear that? -It's our ass on the line. Move it! -Push the pedal to the metal! -Come on! Fuck, they're gonna kill me if they catch me. Drive the fuck faster, you're driving like my grandpa! Man, why can't you drive any faster?! -Are you fucking kidding me? -Faster! We're gonna die! Faster, come on! Barasabia is Romania. My rocket! Be careful with my rocket! We're dead meat if you don't drive faster! They shot a hole through my windshield! Nice going! Dude, it's either us or... Just leave it! Leave it! Catch that fucker! Hey! I want their ears on a stick! Goddamn, I'm so tired. It's so beautiful over here. This can't be happening. You coming home this late. You didn't even bother to call and now you bring home a wild animal. What are you watching? Animal Planet. I won't have it. I don't care what kind of situation Roxi is in right now, but she's not moving in here with us. The same goes for Ana. -Why not? What's wrong with that? -Don't you get it? They want the house. They'll send us to a nursing home the first chance they get. How can you not remember where you parked your car?! My cello was in there, I swear if anything happens to it... Will you stop coughing on me already? I'm coughing to make you aware that there's an old lady next to you. I can barely stand up and I'm carrying these heavy bags. I'm pregnant, OK? Really, how far along are you? Half an hour and my legs are still shaking. Young people nowadays! What are you, 15? -Oh, fuck off already! I'm not 15. -16, tops... They don't have any kind of consideration, for anything. They have expensive cars. -Expensive clothes... -Stop it! I can't believe this. Why don't you just delete it?! I was drunk, for God's sake. I want out. More than 600 in just half an hour and I'm supposed to delete it? Really? If you give up now, you're gonna lose everything. -Why did you get so drunk anyway? -Because of you. -Because of us... -Ana, a bet is a bet. We can go viral with this. Do you know what that means? Yeah, millions of people are gonna see us make a fool of ourselves. What am I gonna tell my dad? -Morning! -Bye! Daddy? -I need to tell you something. -No, Ana, we have to leave... -...for that urgent thing we have to do. -Now? No... I have to tell him. The girls and I made a bet to see who can get married first. I don't want to... Seriously? Great! Good for you! You don't have to live like two stray dogs anymore. -I think you owe me an explanation. -Mom, it's just a joke! Come on, Ana! Bye! Wait till I tell you what just happened, you're gonna fall on your ass when you hear this. The girls are getting married. They're finally leaving. It's gonna be just us. HOW TO GET MARRIED IN THREE DAYS YOU GOTTA BE KIDDIN' ME! I WANT IN TOO! "NOT COOL, GUYS!" "HOW STUPID CAN YOU BE?" "SOMEONE HASN'T BEEN LAID IN A WHILE..." "GTFO!" "KISSES... YOU KNOW WHERE!" FREE ONLINE DATING Florin79, male, 36 years old -Hello. -Hi. Ana, you don't stand a chance! Hi, I'm Roxi and this is my self-portrait. This is research for my final term essay. I'm trying to find out two things. First of all, what marriage means for young people today. Secondly, I'm interested in what good can come from a night of partying drunk downtown. Yes, of course I'm sober, teach'. If you can still walk, because probably you've just been castrated... -I invite you to my wedding. -Wedding? You're insane. I've been thinking about you for months, but, um... You married who? None of the men I've been with compare to you. Marry me and I'll make sure you're happy every day for the rest of your life. I didn't leave you, I just didn't have the courage to answer your calls. I can be a virgin again just for you. You want me to do what? Keep dreaming. I mean a real wedding. With a godfather, music, your drunk mother dancing, the whole thing. You have a better idea...?! Who are you calling a whore?! I'm out of your Little Penis League. What's all this career talk? A woman's place is in the kitchen. What good is she if she can't cook?! I can give you anything your heart desires. Even the moon if that's what you want. Marriage?! No, thank you. Yeah, I'm okay with a woman working, but she should also make time to take care of the house. I... lost... my... parents... when... I... was... little. But I... want a big... family with many... kids. Baby, did you at least save a panda? Or paint a symphony? I want someone I can admire. A wife must fascinate you... each day in the long term. Otherwise, that toy you got between your legs... Every bitch has one of those. I already checked. Didn't your mother teach you not to leave your ID when you go to hookers? This picture is shit, but you're the guy alright. You got one minute to tell me where our girl is. -Countdown begins: 50... 49... -A minute has 60 seconds. I don't want to argue with you. Let's meet in the middle: -30... 29... -I don't know! I swear I don't know. You don't know, huh? -Longer you don't remember... -They left somewhere. I don't know! I swear I don't know. You really don't know? LOST ROCKET -My rocket! -Dare to call me a racketeer? -Does that hurt? Does it? -It does! Where's Iuliana, huh? -Where? -I don't know. You don't know, but you sure know how to run from us. Oops! Let's see... Well, well... Go to hell! Get it? Don't lower the price! Hold your horses! I'll be right there. You're late!

Why the hell would you wanna do that? That's forbidden! It's forbidden! Marriages are binding spells. They're evil! What am I gonna do with you? You said you do spells. Of course I do spells. "Mother Exile can solve anything!" I have so much experience that even the police won't tie him better. Let's see. You got any money? How much you got? Let me see, otherwise my powers won't work.

I'll tell you what: I'll cut a nice deal, just this once.

Get your lazy ass out of my office. Hello? MONEY CAN BUY YOU LOVE: 50,000 EUR. 48 HOURS. What the fuck is going on here? He glued us together with Superglue. Fuck you and your brilliant ideas! Easy! He glued us together! How are we supposed to unglue ourselves?! Easy! Do it real gently! He glued us together! Sorry, I didn't mean to! Holy shit! Don't you fucking touch me! Bring a knife and scissors! Look, I wanna explain everything. Do you guys think those girls are there out of their own will?! What do you guys care?! You go there, have fun and off you go. Don't you have any sisters? Girlfriends? If it were them, what would you do? My plan was to come to Romania for a year as a babysitter, save up some money... Bring my little sister here and move to Germany. When I first came here, they locked me up, they tore up my clothes and they beat me. After a few days, they told me "good life is gonna cost you, but here's a job. Come on, be a business girl." I found out last night what that job was. You were my second client. I've heard that one before. "You were my second..." I'm sorry, but... You have to go back and talk this through with them. You stupid or what? Don't you get it, I lov... -You lost it, bro! -Mihai... Myself, I'm in love with my teeth. How the hell did I end up with the two of you as friends? We have to pay them, no doubt about it. I've got an idea, we can rob a bank or two, or even more if we have to. They're gonna go bankrupt anyway. Or we can just go to them with her and talk to them. Yes, but not with her. With money. At least some... As much as we can find. We'll ask for a monthly rate, we'll negotiate, but we won't give up. Please. Fuck me, he's in love now. For the first time. He was a virgin only in his soul. Excellent! Can I offer you a five-star drink? A coffee maybe? I sure hope you can. Let's get to know each other better. What do you think about marriage? Theoretically, I don't care about marriage. But practically... Did you make a bet with your friends, which of you bones me first tonight? -It's not what you think... -Don't worry, I like a good bet. Here's the deal: we tell them it was love at first sight and tomorrow we get married. Nobody's gonna believe us. Oh, yes they will. Because we're actually going to do it. Drink up! You just have to pay for the marriage registration. It's up to you. Up to me... Alright, I do. Here we are again. The oldest trick in the book. With what you make selling perfumes, we'd cover the payment in about 50 years. Isn't this dangerous? Only if the cops catch us. Mihai's been doing this for years, there's nothing to worry about. He's exaggerating. We've only done it once or twice just for fun. Mihai was a poor kid while growing up. And he's the romantic type. He acts like a tough guy only to protect himself. -What about girls? -Girls? What girls? He's never been with any girl. You're the first. He plants tulips in front of his apartment. -He recycles, adopts cats. -Paints the fences green. -Cats? -He has seven cats! Iulia, I'm telling you, he's a great guy. Did you see the ass on that bitch? The one with the Mercedes. This is how you speak in front of a lady? That stupid bitch is the one from the elevator. -The one that double-crossed me. -You high or what?! That one had short hair. This one's a red head with long hair. Wigs, make-up, girly magic, mister magician. Look! Fellas, the one right there is all we need. What's that supposed to mean? I just know the chick. There's nothing going on between us. -But there's gonna be. -Really? I'm getting out! What are you doing? Come on! -Are you nuts? -Enough! She's all you need... Take this! -DID YOU FIND YOUR FOOL? -EPIC, DUDES! I WANNA GET MARRIED TOO! I'LL BELIEVE IT WHEN I SEE IT... Are you hurt? We're fucking rich! Oh, he's hurt alright. Just a second, please. To see where she is. This isn't the time for that. How can you be so relaxed when our girls are about to ruin their lives? Listen up, I'm gonna have a serious talk with the both of them tomorrow. That's great! -It better be a very serious talk. -Yeah! -You'll talk to Roxi... -Yeah! And I'll talk to... Aaa... na. Got it? Hello? Yes? Oh, nothing much. I was just reading something. Can I call you back in an hour? Better make that two hours. OK, thanks. Bye! -Who was that? -I don't know. Hello. -Where's that book I was looking for? -It's here. Sorry. Right there, under your pillow. They're with weed. Of course they are, they're organic. A little something to give you some energy. I even gave some to Roxi. -Do we know each other? -On the outside or the inside? The phone... My phone is ringing. -I don't hear anything. -It's vibrating. It's not the phone. Please don't tell me you used that. No, we used it together. Is there anyone else here? No, but it would've been a great idea. Get the fuck out! What? Seriously?! You're kicking me out? Leave! -This isn't just about sex, you know. -Are you stupid? I said, get out! Oh, boy... Last night was a totally different story... I said get out already! Didn't your mother teach you how to treat your guests? Leave, you stupid bitch! Do I have to fucking ask you nicely? A gift! What happened to you that made you want to take it out on people like this? OK, it was nice, but I like men and this right here is ruining my reputation. You guys hungry? That's just what I'm looking for. People who are starving! Today we'll have a feast. You'll make such a nice steak! I say we make some meatballs out of this one. No need to jump to conclusions. Let's see what he has to say. Come on! Take a seat, boy. Sit, sit. You dogs wait here! I don't see the girl with you. Don't tell me you've got 50,000 on you? Hey, turd! Why don't you help us out and give these small ones a turn? I'm not good with grilling. I'm good with jokes, you know. I do tricks. Here, let me show you. One moment, please. We take this soda... And suddenly... Look, loser, I'm the one with the happy ending in this picture. If they're rare, you'll be getting rare too, you hear me? If they get burned, you get burned! Take one! Take one, chew it well and explain why you're here. Before I lose my temper. You wouldn't want that to happen. I'm gonna break the teeth of this dumbass. Let's not rush into things. He's better at grilling. -Oh, yeah? -Yeah. Let's see you work your magic, pretty-face. Move! We want them nice and juicy. -Come on! -No! This is my rocket! Give them a turn! How's 100,000 sound? I'd have to say... 10 GRAMS OF WEED AND I'LL MARRY YOU. DEAL! WHERE DO WE MEET? MEET ME AT 9:00 IN P3. LOVE, YOUR FUTURE HUSBAND. "DO YOU DO BLOWJOBS?" "PROBLEM?" "CALL ME, I'M HORNY!" "HEAVEN FORBID!" "GET YOUR LAZY ASSES TO WORK!" Hey! What have you been up to? I've been working so hard lately. The rocket is ready! What happened to you? Elvis hit my head on the table. You smell funny. Like barbecue. Did you have fun with the girls? No, not really. Roxi is devastated. They had such a beautiful thing going on. -You know, I was thinking... -Yes? ...about what we could do to avoid such a situation... Really? How? We love each other, don't we? And... I want to be with you for the rest of my life. And... Maybe we're ready to take the next big step. I think... we should... let things take their natural course. Guess what? Ana's getting married! No, not that one! I mean our Ana! With Obama! Beats me, with her boyfriend probably. That's great! Nothing much, you know, we're doing alright, we could use some money though, if you have any... Don't give me that! You know, the money you've got hidden in your old socks! Reading from John's Sacred Gospel. To the Jews who had believed Him, Jesus said... "Very truly I tell you, whoever hears my word... and believes him who sent me has eternal life and will not be judged, but has crossed over from death to life. For as the Father has life in himself, so he has granted the Son also to have life in himself." Hi, are you here alone? Mommy, who's this lady? Who's this? Who's this? She just came out of the blue and sat next to me. Who are you and why are you touching my husband? Oh, I just felt a little dizzy, that's all. Sure... Dear Lord, what kind of a woman hits on a married man at a funeral?! "My judgment is just, for I seek not to please myself but him who sent me." -How can you be so rude? -What are you talking about? -I saw you! -What did I do?! Keep it in your pants, will you? "Do not be amazed at this... for a time is coming... and come out... My Father who sent me." I hacked their alarm system. I don't know what we're gonna do about this furry fella. He has no software to hack. You're just too smart to know. Sleeping pills, bro! Don't touch that, please! Magi got it for Roxi. Dude, we're not allowed to touch anything in this freaking house! Why don't you make something for a change? I will. Make yourself useful! I'll tell Iulia to teach Ana some relaxation methods. Get my point? Ana proposed to me. Say what?! It's even worse. The three of them made a bet. Who gets married first. No way! Who's getting married? What are you doing? He's gonna flip when he hears this. We can't do this without him. -We've got to tell... -Just shut the fuck up, okay? It's me, I'm getting "spoused." You wanna say you're getting married. And put that champagne back. The apple too! Just like Sharapova in the third set. I want more movement when we get to the "voleo." This one and this one have to go all the way. Come on! Princess Roxana? So here's the deal: I'll let you do stuff to me... and you'll marry me. Do you really not recognize me? First marriage on the forum. You don't see that every day! I found you crying in the elevator. You were failing in history. I helped you make scraps of paper for the exam about Michael the Brave. You impressed your teacher, you went off with him and forgot all about me. If you get me this stuff every week, we can be whatever you want us to be. When your father hit the jackpot and you guys moved, you gave me a phone number. I called and it was a pharmacy... Those years were tough on me too. But now I'm cool. We can get married. Drink up, my wife! -Congratulations on our marriage! -That's right! Such a beautiful love story deserves a happy ending. When did Michael the Brave rule? Yasmine, ending up with a whore isn't a happy ending. It's social work. ROOM 69 Wanna know why I'm so lucky? These young men just don't know how to treat a woman. Get out, snotty face! My father's an army general, he'll make sure you rot in jail! Even with your mouth full, you still won't stop yapping about marriage! Fuck off! Two million slaves and I can't find a man. Fuck this shit hole of Bucharest city! Roxi! -Did you drug her? -We didn't give her anything. Just tell me what the hell you gave her! -Calm down! -Hey! Shut up! Nothing bad is going to happen, OK? We're just taking you home. When my dad opens the door, just keep your heads down. Did you hear me? Just say: Sir, yes, Sir! Just chill, will you? You'll wake up the dogs. Say you're sorry for causing such an inconvenience and then you get the fuck out of here! Alright already, at least we don't have to kiss his hand... Sir, yes, sir! Ana, what did we say about coming home late? Everybody head home. Thank you, boys. -Good evening, sir. -Whatever. Sorry for the inconvenience. It was an honor. All the best. Look at this one! She fell while thinking? What's up with her?! Get in! Was she plowing all night? Tilling the land? Must have worked really hard. -She's not feeling so well. -Oh, really? Get your ass in here! I really don't know why we girls have to be so perfect. I used to be chubbier. Why do we have to look like those cover girls anyway? I don't want to be like Yasmine. I really don't. I want to be me. "DEEPLY TOUCHING!" "I HOPE YOU FIND YOUR SOULMATE!" "NICE TITTIES!" What does BF mean? And XOXO? I mean an X and an O and another X and an O. That's not how you read it! That's how you write it. It means "hugs and kisses." You know, hugs and kisses, hugs and kisses. Why don't you just say it like that then? Hug then kiss, hug then kiss. Because I ain't got the time for all that, duh! What about YOLO? Which means: Carpe diem. That way, Mr. Ceausu will also get it if he asks. -That's so nice. -Yeah... See that's why you shouldn't jump into things when you're very young... What about blowjo'? -Mom! -What?! -Not so loud! -Did I say it wrong? -It's blowjob. -Blowjob. Exactly. It's, well, when a girl does it with her mouth... you know. Oh, fellatio! C'mon! Why don't you just say so? What's the big deal? Listen... What if you're wearing braces? -Mom, come on! -I'm just curious. You're traumatizing me, seriously, just drop it, please. Alright, do you know what a bitch is? A stuck up girl who refuses to perform fellatio. Hey! What's with this attitude? I didn't raise you to talk like that! Apparently you did. Can we talk about this bet you girls made? Please, Roxana! It's alright if you lose. You don't have to ruin your life with the first guy that shows up. Honey? -Why did you break up with Magi? -He just left. He left? Really? What an idiot! When you love a man who loves you back, you don't just let him leave. You keep him. What did I say now?! YOLO, mom! Carpe diem! Look at this one! You're better off on the side of the road, honey! Up yours, you dumb fucking bitches! Yasmine, are you OK? No, I'm not. Nobody wants to marry me. Ana and Bogdan can't get enough of each other and Roxi says she's spoiled for choice. Spoiled for choice? What do you mean? They're both getting married today and I'm left... They're both what? They're gonna win the bet! What don't you get? We made a bet: who gets married first in three days. Roxi wants to get married? Yes! What's the fucking novelty in that? Where are you going? You wanker! Hello, is Roxi home? I need to see her. As a parent, you come to understand so many things. There's really no point in getting angry. You don't understand. I love her! I love her and I want to marry her. Thank you for the flowers. I was actually worried I wouldn't find any. Let's go. Look, if you can get some weed, I'll put in a good word for you. FOR THE DOG! Would you be willing to donate seven drops of blood for me? Not in the sink! No! -Hi there, honey! -You're here... First! You're letting us wait at the door? This place is so nice! -Do I smell burned plastic? -Um, why don't you take a seat? -We will. -I just need a second in the kitchen. Look what I got for you! You wouldn't believe how long it took me to find the perfect bouquet! -Do you like them? -Yes, I do. So do I. What is she making? Cabbage stew? Come on! That must be them! Or maybe it's the mail man. Or the owner asking for the rent. Maybe she didn't pay the rent. -I'm Bogdan's mother. -I'm Ana, nice to meet you. -I'm Bogdan's father. -Nice to meet you. The mother of Stephen the Great. I just remembered that poem. -These are my parents, my dad... -Bogdan's mother. -Nice to meet you. -And Cecilia. -Bogdan's mother. -Cecilia. Nice to meet you. Bogdan's father. I'm Ana's father. I'm Bogdan's father. OK, I get it, I just thought... you thought I was Bogdan's father. -Oh, no. -Oh, dear, we're all so nervous already. Please excuse me. I just need to finish up in the kitchen. I'll be right back. Please make yourselves comfortable. What about this weather we're having? Where the heck is he?! The weather is nice, I like it. Isn't it? -It took us... How long to get here? -Half an hour. Half an hour to get here. How long did it take you? We drove here from our home... Râmnicu Vâlcea. Yes, I know. How long did it take you? To get here, I mean. -Longer than we expected actually... -Really, how so? -We took the highway... -How come? Did you make a pit stop? -We got lost. -Not even to take a pee? You already took care of that at home, didn't you? What road did you take? -The straight road... -The straight road, of course. Good call. Look what we have here! Not even one bone in there! I don't get their jokes. What's your name, young lady? Yasmine. How old are you, young lady? Twenty. Oh, you're still a little girl. You're allowed to cry. Close your eyes and cry. Go ahead, close your eyes. Do you hear those high heels rushing off somewhere? What happened to you that made you want to take it out on people like this? You're completely insane! I never want to see you again! Yasmine, ending up with a whore isn't a happy end. It's social work. Get out, snotty face! Even with your mouth full, you still won't stop yapping about marriage! Now, do you feel the wind in your hair? Do you feel the sun on your cheek? You're only twenty years old and you have so many things to look forward to. You have all the time in the world to change your life if you don't like it. It's that simple. Thank you. This spot. This is where you've been longing for a kiss. It's a shame people don't do this more often. Râmnicu Vâlcea is not the same as Râmnicu Sãrat, is it? No, they're different. It's pronounced Vâl-cea, like a small valley, you know. People mistake them. -Good afternoon... -C'mon in, we've been waiting for you. Bogdan, honey, why didn't you tell us you wanted to get married? Mom? -Ana? -Yes, Ana, come and join us. Just look at these two! A match made in heaven! Different customs. You man up and ask for her hand properly, and we're good to go! -This whole thing is already a mess! -Mother, please! It's a misunderstanding. Leave him alone, dear, he's obviously nervous. It's normal. Oh, bless their young hearts! We were a disaster ourselves back in the day. I'll get you strong on some of this holy water and everything's gonna be fine! You can call me dad! Or else, I won't recognize you as my son! Why didn't you tell us anything? Were you raised by wolves? Did we really have to find out from a stranger? Bogdan, we're a family. We should tell each other everything. We've never had any secrets in our family, you know. We told each other everything. Well, except for the important stuff. That's personal, you know. How can you do this to me? I was about to ask you the same thing. I gave you everything, including my virginity. Did I tell you the story about the turkey? -Well, Mr. Pintesteanu, this story is... -Budisteanu! -What did I say? -Tãtãrãsanu. Where's the steak? -What steak? -The one that was in the fridge. I cooked it, what was I supposed to... See here, so... the turkey... that Ana cooked... so then... I told her... Honey, who taught you... to cook so good... Thank God he's shutting up. Keep talking, I'll catch up... -Can you believe these people? -I guess he likes joking around. -I think we should go home. -I got a joke for ya... A guy walks into a bar... Dad... Dad! What the fuck?! So here's the plan... Good evening, gentlemen! Please accept this welcome gift. Do you have the stuff? The sandman says hi! Team Alpha sets the targets. Once confirmed, team Beta deactivates all security devices. DANGER Our Moldavian mercenary pals will infiltrate the premises at this time. You come in through the back and help us out a bit, OK? The coast is clear. And we take care of our target, namely the canine beast. The steak! I'm gonna kill you if I get out of here alive. It's not my fault. For the dog! If that doesn't work, there's plan B. Wow, dude, I had no idea you were this good. Sweet dreams and thank you for the investment! Woman asleep, by Iorgulescu. Woman asleep. These statuettes look like they're from... the 18th century at least. In fact, it's 16th-century art. -35,000! -What, for this ugly bitch?! Take it, bro! You won't find art at such a bargain. Well, if it's art, you say... LADY AND SOLDIER 3,000! Tops! -10,000 is a more reasonable price... -I call the shots around here. -3,000? -All right. 500. -We'll see about that. -600. -Wall lamp: 1,000. -We'll take it. -Great! -Wall lamp, 1,000. 300! -These two come as a set: 1,200! -Yeah, sure! There's some from Picasso too! They have paintings with a pig's ass, huh? Yes, with a pig's ass... A pig's ass... Yeah, now that's what I'm talking about. I like these big ones... Big paintings have big prices, you know... We'll see about that! Let's not be too hasty, fellas! Do you know who this house belongs to? This one's a talking statue! How much is this one? -10,000! -No! No people for sale! -Free of charge, right? -Turnip, take Nikita here to the truck. For personal use, you know. We'll see. Pleasure doing business with you, motherfuckers. We'll split it in half, of course. Minus expenses, bro. Of course. We Transnistrians have a saying. Beware of Romanians. But you guys are pretty upright businesspeople. Let's go, Turnip! A bonus for the best three buddies ever. Where did you steal these from? Steal?! Who, me? I found them in a drawer. They were begging me to take them. -And you had to take them? -Damn right! We're upright Romanians alright, but we ain't their bitches. No fucking way! "WHO LOST WHAT?" "LET'S GO TO IBIZA, NOW!" "IT'S SO COMPLICATED BEING AN ARTIST!" "DIDN'T ANYONE WANT YOU?" Alright, is this all your stuff? I've got a little something I need to add. For real? Skilled... Enduring... Faithful... Are you OK? Every man I've been with has humiliated me. None of them ever loved me. Have you loved any of them? No. Then why do you care? We'll always be there for you and if any jerk ever tries to hurt you, we'll show him! I lost the easiest bet ever! I love you guys! I love you too! Me too! To live honestly... you have to know how to steal, man. Yeah, that's us. We got it all. I got the money and I got the girl. Ana's riding this guy's rocket tonight! You're going with Roxi on a cruise trip. But I don't have Roxi anymore. Don't worry, man, there are plenty of Roxis out there. Stop here, at the flower shop, please! We'll stop near our place. I want this one and I want this Roxi! What's your problem? This is where I bought the first bouquet I ever gave her, OK? Magi... we've stopped. I should get out then. What are we gonna do with this stuff? We could stack them together and auction them... This one's a real business woman, isn't she?! -Roxi! -Oh, come on, knock it off! Bet you don't have the guts to try it on. These go with that one over there. Put them together. With the money we make, we're gonna go to... Ibiza! That'd be awesome! If we're ever gonna make that much money. What's this? Ana, it's her journal! The Complete Idiot's Guide to Love! No way! I wrote about almost everyone in there! Even the history teacher?! No, you didn't! YASMINE'S JOURNAL We sold the journal for 5,000! -No way! -I can't believe this! We leave right now! Ana, you're in charge of buying plane tickets on that relic phone of yours. Ana, what are we gonna do with you?! ELENA WET: IS THIS STILL FOR SALE? What's this? Does this look like a damn concert hall to you? What's with all this racket in my own patio? Have you boys lost it? -Good morning! -I'll be right there, son! Come on, come in! Make yourselves at home! I'm getting married! Hey you! Get your ass over here. What's the deal with all this racket? I'm here to ask for your daughter's hand in marriage... again. Will you give her to him or should I? I will because this lad's gonna be coming here every day. Get over here! -This is it. -Good, great! Hey, you, Vienna Philharmonic! Note down your repertoire. Everything's set? Father? Where are you? Father, do a nice ceremony, but we'll talk money later, alright? -Ceci, get the girls! -In a minute! Congratulations! It's fine! Congratulations to everyone. We have food, drinks... The girls aren't here. They didn't spend the night at home. As usual! Don't worry, guys. I'll take care of this. They don't always spend the night at home, but I'll get them for you. Come on, say something for our Facebook fans! I don't have a Facebook account anymore, but I'll post on Yasmine's. -Oh, fuck, Magi's calling me. -No, no guys! We're gonna buy ourselves some Schengen bikinis! She's going to Ibiza... It's over. We go after her! How?! With that bus over there! Why didn't I think of that? PREMIUM BLONDE BEER Please, come on, can't you drive any faster? Faster, come on! -Faster, come on! -We'll get there, calm down! Man, I can't wait to taste one of those brownies. Ceci, pass me one of those, will ya? Later, not now! Ceci, if you don't give me one now, I'm leaving the wheel and getting one myself! I don't have them right now! Close call, huh? Hold on tight! Dad? I love you! I love you too! SPECIAL FORCES Get down! Everybody on the ground! Get down now! Get down! Everybody get your IDs ready to be checked and take everything out of your pockets! What about that other girl? The one with the perfume. There is no other girl. That was Mihai and his girlfriend. I was selling perfumes to save up for a trip around the world, like you always wanted. I can spend the rest of my life with you. Maybe this will shut you two up! Everybody against the wall! Ana... I've been thinking about it and maybe you're right. If you want us to get married, then let's get married. You humiliated me in front of everyone. No. I need to focus on me, not on being your girlfriend. I don't understand what's happening. Me neither, dude. Your name is Yasmine, you live in Primãverii, your parents are filthy rich and you have a thing for history teachers. SPECIAL FORCES Let's play a game. If I win, we get married. No more games. Let's just love each other. It's that simple. Seeing that you're the hot shot around here, I have something to ask you. Roxana, do you take George to be your husband? Yes, I do. Yes, I do. Subtitle translation by Olivia Primejdie
