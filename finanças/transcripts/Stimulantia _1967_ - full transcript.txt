The necklace Subtitles by Seglora What stimulated you into doing this particular film? It was the kind invitation by Swedish Film Industry to participate with a contribution to "Stimulantia" And I was grateful for the assignment but .. You don't say no to a good offer But as matter of fact I was quite doubtful Since I had retired after many years of film work And for me it was a closed chapter But Guy de Maupassant's short story "The necklace" tempted me And it's always nice to succumb to temptations Two circumstances made me change my mind First of all, Ingrid Bergman had promised to do the main part My work, cooperation with Ingrid Bergman, that started in 1934 when she was in the film "Swedenhielms" against Gösta Ekman would after 30 years come to an end with my definitely final movie The delicious meat stew I think I must have some more It's my favourite dish Yes I know that Yes,indeed, you know it Thanks You've been saying that for 10 years now Yes, time flies Even in the Royal Departments? I thought it had stopped there Not for us minor officials On the contrary, it passes too quickly The batch of papers and memorandum grows,we can't keep up I know that Yes,indeed, you know it I've mentioned that too But what does Ellen want now, I didn't call I thought I'd take your plates But doesn't Ellen see that the Secretary isn't finished yet? My goodness! Dear Ellen, I'm almost done Yes, there we are, thank you It is even worse than usually today -I saw Jeanette Ribbing today -Yes What clothes, what jewellery Oh, she was so beautiful You are much, much more beautiful (If you knew) inadvertently IB slips into English Oh sure the way I'm dressed -Ribbings have money,Matilde -Yes, and we don't , I know that Your childhood friend married well I wasn't exactly a good match Your parents made me feel that on occasions -But we manage -Yes You're happy as long as you get your meat stew And get to go hunting with your superiors once in a while But what about me? I don't hunt and I do not think a meat stew is a break from this monotony Nothing ever happens here Everything is so Gray and drab, and there's nothing fun or beautiful around us Sometimes on our evening walks, when I see lit-up windows I think I can see myself in the light of the cut-glass chandeliers I can hear myself laugh People address me and smile at me and speak so beautifully The floors are shining and the rugs are soft and the furniture is so comfortable Someone plays a waltz on the grand piano Someone comes towards me and bows to me And everything swirls, around, around and past Matilde Yes, you say my name and everything gets cold I feel that I'm standing in the street and the windows are closed Now I'm alone I'm with you Matilde! Matilde where are you? Here. Home already? Oh,so you're there Look at this -This is something for you -For me? Yes An invitation card Invitation card? Yes and quite posh Yes Under-secretary of State Emmanuel Bjelke and wife herewith have the honour of inviting Mr. and Mrs. Hartman to supper with dance at his house at the Royal Djurgården Saturday 4 June But that's not for me I thought you'd be happy You must believe me not many of the subordinates get invited You'll get to see the high society But what do you want me to wear? Well,I didn't think of that You can take the dress you usually wear to the theatre What's the matter? What is it? Nothing I don't have anything to wear so I can't go Matilde, let's think about this How much could a dress be? Not too expensive I have no idea Perhaps 100 crowns Yes, yes, there you see I'll get the money Thanks I'll get it What are you saying? What? And there? But just wait Do you want me to help you? Oh, you're beautiful It is so beautiful But something is missing Are you sure? What is? Yes, it looks so bare without a necklace You know,I don't have anything that goes together with this I have nothing to put on I'll look so hopelessly poor How about a flower? It's not that uncommon-- No, then they'll understand that I don't have anything else And there is nothing so humiliating to look poor among rich women Couldn't you borrow a necklace? Borrow? From whom? Well, perhaps from Jeanette Ribbing But you can't believe she could .. -I can't borrow -Sure you can Good friends like you Maybe,perhaps you're right Try to help me with this I could always give it a try Yes, I'll go there, I'll go there I'll be right with you, Matilde, I'm just looking for the key Yes Go ahead and play I don't play any more Don't touch! Ha ha ha Let us see here Here you can choose exactly what you want Just try them out ! Have a seat And I hope you find something which you really like Here It's so nice to see you, Mathilde You never come to see me though I've asked you so many times Yes We lead so different lives That doesn't matter Yes, it does My life is so ugly Brigitte (Jeanette)slip of IB Dear friend The.. -It's very beautiful -Yes, it is Keep looking. Look at this one Oh Try it on, there's a mirror over there Well, what do you think? Would you lend me this? Only this Yes, yes, you're so welcome to take it But It's incredible! And that I got to borrow it just like that The rich can afford to be frivolous But where's your rifle? My rifle? -Yes, I -Yes but It was hanging on this wall just a few days ago Please answer me ! I've sold it You've sold it to get money for the dress, didn't you? Oh Paul How nice of you, oh how sweet you are, Paul I'm sure you get to borrow a stupid blunderbuss when you go on your hunts -Yes I'm sure But I have to try the necklace for my new dress And there you are I've been looking for you,why are you out here? I needed some fresh air And then I'm looking at you -Are you having fun? -Fun? It's wonderful Oh everything is so They are so elegant and joyful They're flocking around me It is as if I'd always been in a place like this So you're being courted You don't mind,do you? Why would I ? I'm proud of you I'm so glad that you're happy State Secretary Bjelke danced with me I saw that He said he really appreciates you Ah, I'm not even sure he knows who I am Yes, I'm sure he knows you Oh Paul what a home they have! What And then the music You know, there was a silly man in there who said I was the most beautiful here He was spot on No,you're just saying that,Paul come and dance with me, come -But I'm such a bad dancer -Well -I just look foolish -No one sees us -All right, out here -Yes, yes We'll start here Oh these five stairs I've been running a lot I've almost lost my breath Why didn't you wait for a carriage? Well, you don't think I'd like to stand among all the others with this ugly coat I'll buy you a new one as soon as we can afford it It's so wonderful to see you this happy and beautiful, Matilde I'll get extra work I'll work through whole nights so we equally can fulfil all our dreams We need beautiful clothes and to surround you with beautiful things I promise you to toil to make our life less dull Oh Paul Listen, I may have been too content I didn't realize how much these things mean to you So Paul What is it? -It's gone -Gone? The necklace,can't you see ? Jeanette's necklace, it's gone Did you have it when we left the Bjelkes? Yes, I'm certain I must have lost it on our way home in Djurgården or in the town Oh my God What are we going to do? -Where are you going ? -I'm going out searching for it I'll go all the way back and see if I can find something No Well? Where have you been? Have you been to the police? I have been there They hadn't found anything Oh, what are we going to do? Yes, I'll.. Yes,perhaps we'll have to advertise for it I'll go to the police every day and see if But Jeanette, I have to return it You can write to the Counsellor and say that the necklace had a clasp broken and that you've sent it to be repaired, just to buy us some time. Well What did she say? How did it go? Did she notice anything? She didn't even look at it Thank goodness By the way, the difference is not that big Hardly anything at all No Maybe so Paul You didn't tell me how much you paid for it 12000 12000? Yes 12000 I went to many jewellers and looked, I don't know how many necklaces This was the only one that looked the same Where did you get money from? Bank drafts, moneylenders, usurers But Paul How are we going to manage? What will we live on? We can't stay here. The rent will be too much I'm going to look for another place tomorrow I'll work as much as I possibly can We have to fire Ellen, we must manage without her help Yes We'll remember this as the luxury we once could afford Paul, I promise to help you as much as I can We'll have to help each other, Matilde I keep falling asleep It's late why don't you go to bed? I have to finish this I have to pay a large sum soon again Yes I know Roll over instalments Roll over instalments For five years roll over instalments I don't see an end to it Is there much left to be paid? What's wrong? Nothing Are you tired? I've cleaned two homes today The ladies snipe and are never satisfied I say nothing I don't know what tires me the most, the hard work or the humiliation But get yourself a rest Get some sleep It's not paying off either. We have nothing to spend Everything is so damned expensive The housekeeping costs a lot I do my best! I haggle for the cheapest items And I'm not affording myself anything I haven't bought a rag in all those years Me neither I mend, I clean,I wash,I scrub So what? Many people do Are you too delicate? -I didn't say that -But that's what you think Actually, you belong with Bjelke's kind, right? Do you always have to remind me that it's my own fault? I didn't say that But you make me feel it Damned,I can't afford to pay attention to your feelings Many people are in your place without making a fuss about it. We are going to pay for it. Pay! Pay! Pay! Mind your own business Plates cost money I know it's tough I really wish I could have given you another life It's my own fault It's my own fault You can't control your dreams -Matilde -Yes Stop that What is it? I can hardly believe it But tell me! -It's over -Over? Everything is paid for I made the last payment today After 10 years everything is paid for Is it really true? I'm too tired to even to be happy There's a little hare Can you see it? There's a squirrel, don't you think so? Stop, Matilde Matilde No wait Matilde -Don't you recognize me? -Of course I do, yes, Jeanette But Matilde Yes, I know I've changed a lot No, you haven't But why have you never visited me during all these years? Has something happened, Matilde? Happened? Perhaps,it's something to do with you,Jeanette With me? Do you remember that spring night 10 years ago? -You mean when you borrowed the necklace? -Yes I lost it Lost it? But you returned it Yes, I know, we bought another one,similar We had to pay for it over these last ten years You understand,it was not that easy for us You bought another instead of mine? Yes, it's paid now, it's paid Good God Matilde And to think you didn't notice But Matilde My necklace didn't have real diamonds What are you saying? It wasn't worth more than 50 crowns, it was not a genuine one Not genuine? It can't be true Dear Matilde Say that it's not true Matilde Matilde Who was that Mom? Subtitles by Seglora
