The only person who could tell us what was her intention to be there that evening is Jennifer herself. Unlike other ladyboys probably have to work that way every night, she had different chances than that. Whatever she did to end up there, it has nothing to do with what happened inside. Simply nothing. You know, she was killed on the 11th of October. October 1, we got the confirmation that her visa is granted. Here in Germany, the official wedding date was set. Her wedding dress was bought already. We are just inches away to make our both dream of life come true. [somber music] How the killing of a trans Filipina woman ignited an international incident. On October 11 of last year, the U.S. Marines stationed aboard the USS Peleliu got their first night of liberty after their Tarawa-class amphibious assault ship docked in Subic Bay. Private First Class Joseph Scott Pemberton, a 19-year-old from New Bedford, Massachusetts, eagerly disembarked with his battle buddies Bennett Dahl, Daniel Pulido, and Jairn Rose. Jennifer first left her apartment with her friend, Jamille. They took a tricycle to Ambyanz Nightclub and arrived there at approximately 10:30. [Meredith] The club was a frequent hangout for sex workers known as Pocahontases, a riff on pok-pok, a Tagalog term for slut, which also alludes to the former colonizers who often patronize them. The most dogged of these women, those who quickly latch onto the arms of the men pouring off the ships, are usually transgender. But the foreign soldiers rarely learned that. Approximately at 10:45, Private First Class Joseph Scott Pemberton entered Ambyanz with three other Marines. [Meredith] The women had been working since the soldiers went on liberty that afternoon. And by 10:45, when Laude met Pemberton, she'd already been with three clients. "Jennifer was exhausted," said another friend Charis. "We work as hard as we can when the soldiers are here." Within a few minute of meeting, Pemberton and Laude left for the Celzone Lodge, a motel across the street, accompanied by Laude's friend, Barbie Gelviro. According to Elias, the cashier bellboy, Pemberton, Jennifer, and Barbie entered Celzone Lodge at approximately 11:05 p.m. Elias assigned them room number one. [Meredith] Gelviro stayed with the couple for a minute to help negotiate a rate. Laude suggested 5,000 pesos, but Pemberton only wanted to pay 1,000, about $25. Laude, nervous that Pemberton might discover the girls were trans, quickly agree to the lower rate and rushed her friend out of the room. About 30 minutes after the group had arrived at the motel, Pemberton casually walked out of his room alone, leaving the door slightly ajar behind him. He seemed unperturbed as he passed the front desk and walked down the steps into the night. His curfew was rapidly approaching and he and his shipmates needed to return together. Elias expected that Jennifer would shortly follow. But 15 minutes have passed, no one came out of the room. As they were about to go to sleep, Pemberton approached Rose and asked to talk to him in private. They walked over to the front of the ship far from human ears, with only the ocean and the sky to listen. Pemberton said that he saw it had a dick. He told Rose he got so angry, that he choked it from behind. "I think I killed a he-she," Pemberton said. The medical report would show that Jennifer died of asphyxia due to strangulation and drowning and the same is reflected in her death certificate. Her entire back was black and blue.

This VFA really comes into play in this case because it reads about how the Philippines should treat the U.S. soldiers. [upbeat piano music] [Film Narrator] What exactly is legal hold? It may be one of the best things we have in the Philippines. Legal hold means that if you're charged with a crime under local laws, you'll be turned over to U.S. authorities rather than left in a local lock-up. Put it this way, it would be unthinkable for a foreign soldier to commit murder in America and not be apprehended by U.S. police and not be tried by U.S. courts. But what's happened in this case is we have an instance where an American Marine committed a non-service related offense. Number one, he remains in the custody of American soldiers. Number two, he was never physically investigated by Philippine authorities. Number three, his attendance in court proceedings is a matter of cooperation with American authorities rather than as part of mandatory judicial proceedings. With the VFA, it's like the Filipinos are being served on a silver platter. Here are the Philippines, kill them. Here are the Filipinas, rape them.

We actually consider this a watershed moment in the history of the Philippine transgender movement because for the first time, people are seeing us. [soft soothing music] Transgender people have always been part of the history of this country and that goes back through Pre-Colonial times. We saw that in the Babaylan Chronicles, which are documents written by Spanish priests. They took note of male-bodied people who carried themselves as women.

The establishment of religion were so that my kind of people were slowly pushed into the margins of society. How the church vanquished the Babaylan or the Shaman, it had to make the Babaylan somewhat scary so called her a witch and a swine. We were othered by the church. Our bodies are not acceptable. Our identities are not acceptable. We've been forced to be part of niche industries like the beauty industry or the sex industry. The transgender movement itself has to work. They eradicate the notion that you need to sell your body in order to survive. In the meantime, a lot of my trans friends are actually doing sex work.

[soft guitar music] The aftermath of a U.S. Marine's conviction in the death of a Philippine trans woman. It's close to midnight in early December on Waterfront Road in Olongapo, Philippines. Dimly lit by yellow tungsten lamps, women's figures in tight clothing walk down the street, shadows covering their faces. U.S. service members used to be able to roam around the area outside the former base during their leisure time. But since Laude's death last year, the U.S. Military has confined service members to the feed port. A young woman with hair halfway down her back walks alone in Waterfront. Her figure is slim and taller than most of the girls on the street. "I take my customers here," as she gestures towards the darkness beyond the road. Roseanne claims she's 17, but her voice hasn't noticeably dropped. Even though Pemberton killed Laude after finding out she was trans, Roseanne insists that she needs to keep her transgender status from U.S. service members who pay her for sex. [Meredith] In the verdict's aftermath, local officials and residents are eager for U.S. troops to come back and bring money into the city as they once did. [Meredith] Locals have even accused the Laudes of being selfish by not settling the case early. By having gone to trial, the liberty privileges for U.S. troops remain suspended, which in turn has directly led to hundreds, if not thousands of locals losing their sources of income. Just imagine some businessman lose about 20 million pesos in business opportunities because Americans are not having their liberty or their rest and recreational activities. "We expect liberty will resume now that Pemberton has been convicted," Cortez says. Jennifer's mother, Julita Laudes, sits on her brown-floral print couch. Despite the conviction, she is far from satisfied. [Meredith] Other locals express a mixture of sympathy and rejection when it comes to the presence of transgender sex workers in Olongapo. A souvenir vendor on Waterfront Road says that he is indifferent to the Pemberton verdict and wishes only that full liberty would resume, so that ordinary people in Olongapo can have income. [Meredith] Down the street, a female bystander sitting on a nearby park bench shouts back, "Transgenders need to be kicked out of Olongapo." Another taxi driver replies, "Their words hurt too much. Those are our fellow Filipinos." Roseanne is worried about people identifying her and finding out she's a sex worker. Her mother is not aware she is doing sex work. According to the young woman, she thinks I'm just looking for a handsome boyfriend who'll take me to America. As Roseanne continues to roam the streets of Olongapo at night, she has to believe that she will encounter men like Jennifer's fiancé and not a man like the kind who ended Jennifer's life.
