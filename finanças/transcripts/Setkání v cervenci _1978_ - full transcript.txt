Meeting in a July You are young? Youth travel agency - your chance to see the world. But also in our country, in its wonderful corners youth camps and tourist centers are waiting for you. Summer golf courses, tennis, horse riding and foreign languages. Summer with MBP! A summer you won't forget! Who hasn't gotten an application yet? Almost only girls are here, it's good. What are you doing here? Study, study and study again? Or English? What did you write there? Is the purpose of your stay to study? Those two blondes settled down in the room number 18. They already got the keys. Or did you come to ride horses? Do you know the joke how the horse came to the bar and orders himself whiskey and one surprised visitor says to the bartender: The horse is drinking whiskey, isn't it weird? Well, yes, the bartender answers, Indeed, he usually drinks a cognac. - I don't know this joke. What's next? - OK, it is clear... Hey ... And about the guy who comes to the psychiatrist and says: Pan doctor, I have a strange feeling as if I were turning into a horse. Here I am at the races, standing by the paddock when suddenly such a small jockey and gop comes up to me! He saddles me and jump on me. So, so, how did it end? the psychiatrist asks. Well ... I did what I could. We finished in a third position. Hahaha! Also in the numer 10? You could tell me. And how a man rides around Prague, it means, on a horse and leads another one. His friend meets them and asks: Listen, why do you need another horse? This is my nightmare. Now you are with horses, and now this cow too... (cow = girl you don't like, kinda like a bitch) The bed by the window is mine, get out of there! I'm sorry. My name is Tomas. It is not my fault that I was placed in this room. They just shoved me here and that's it. What kind of cow? She let me flunk in English. Because of her, I'm here. The old one or the hot one? It depends on what you think is hot... - It's still weird. - What's weird? The English part. You don't need it to graduate. Yes, she just hates me for some reason. I should have got a grade 4. (in Czechia, they use grades 1-5, 1 = best, 5 = worst) if I didn't show myself in front her.. But she stubbornly thought that I need a re-examination. She said she would find me everywhere. She examined me on the tram. - It must have been fun. - Well, it was maybe for her. Well, let's pay her back. Leave it to me, bro. Do you want me to tell you a fortunes about it on the cards? These are the girls from the equestrian section. This is Jakub. And this is Milena, Helena and Elena. - Not Elena, I'm Alena. - That doesn't matter. - Hold me a seat at the table. - Okay. I found out everything. Breakfast from seven to half past eight. Classes from nine. Your cow teaches at the intermediate level, so you need to level up. Is her name Fisherova? Sorry, I have a window seat. If you go anywhere, leave our key with the administrator. Are you playing? What a coincidence. When did you arrive? I hope it's a pleasant coincidence. Jakub Hein, the man who walks through the walls. Just don't pretend. I also hope that you will get to the advanced ones. Although you are confused about the timing. How would you translate: as soon as I arrived, I immediately met a cow? When I have come, I meet a cow. or in your opinion: I meeted? David, go to sleep! Won't you play? Did she do something to you? Well, screw her. Are you awake? - Well, who are we, huh? - Who? We took revenge on her. The cow that let you flunk. You should have seen her when she opened the doors In a horrible nightgown. - And with a horrible haircut. And he says: girls, here is my room. Alena says: yes, a room? Oh? And she: Oh? She didn?t notice that we changed the sign on the doors. People will knock on the door all night long. In less than three days she will leave. Are you not happy? Wow, he doesn't seem to like it. - Is this true? - No, I'm delighted. Good night. Hey, take your boots and pants away! Are you a fool? How old are you? Ten? - Leave your jokes to yourself. - I thought ... - Don't you think! I won't be here in three days. But during these days I want to live here in a peace. - Where are you going? - Away from here. To the river. - Will you run away? - No. I have a special trick for this. - Hey, what is a fiddlestick? - Containers-bars. - Why do you need this garbage? - I collect it. Imagine that you take it and tell someone Idea from the textbook. Grobauer-Brozova-Malierzh: I met the Duke at a cocktail yesterday. Wow! He really knows how to have fun. Imagine I rubbed shoulders with a duke yesterday at the cocktail party. Goodness! That felow is going it rather strong. Sit down. Sit down. You too. - You should already know ... I asked to sit down! - I am a teacher. I am Mr. Lanex. - How do you do? - I am sorry. Quite! We continue, attention, I dictate, you write. Ready? One, two, three. You understand everything? Fifty fifty. I spent a year with parents in England but he seems to speak some kind of dialect. It is correct. No. Yes. Hm! Sorry. No. Let's repeat the abbreviated forms. I'd worked. He hadn't worked. - You waited. - Have a little more patience, the dentist said, pull out your tooth in a moment. - Please, give... - Give me this book, please. You disturb others who have paid to learn something. This is not a school. You can leave the class and maybe go to switch a signs on some other doors instead. - And when this nonsense leaves your head ... - I haven't changed any plates. - If you think that I ... - Of course I do. You better direct your wits to to get out of the situation in which you put yourself. - Yes, I tell you that I ... - Instead, you do everything to convince me otherwise. Jakub! Fool. He screwed up. This is our car! No one is taking away this ugly piece of shit from you. Mama says she would break it but we have no other car. We used to have P8 before. - Before what? - Well, before we got divorced. - Recently? - What do you have? Knife, jackknife. To disembowel a frogs? - Yeah. And fishes as well. - Where are we going? - Nowhere. - Where to nowhere? Listen, you know what? You should turn around and go away. - Turn where? - Leave me alone! - And why? I don't want your mom to scold me later that I took you somewhere. Are you afraid of my mom? I'm not. Just sometimes. Do you want to see something? Appendicitis. I nearly died! - You're lying! - I'm not lying! - You're lying. Surgery of appendicitis can be done even by the watchman of hospital. Easy peasy. - Yes Yes Yes Yes! - Of course. They can carve it out for you in the elevator and you won't have time to blink an eye. How many stitches did you have? - Six. - And I have seven! Okay. But don't follow me! I go Wherever I want to go. I just can't go too far away. And I can't come back like a pig. - Like a pig? - Well, dirty .. Do you like cherries? - I do! - Come on, dude! Why are you calling me a dude? I'm not. This is how friends call each other. (Another similar situation, Y-Young...haha) You can call me that too. - Can I? - Of course, dude! - Okay. - Dude. - Let's go get some cherries, dude! Lesson seventeen, please! Read... you! - Dear Richard, many thanks for your lest... - Last! ...last letter and the buklet... - booklet! ...booklet you sent me. I thought climbing trees is hard but it's so easy. In our area in Prague there is not a single decent tree. Only some small bushes. I still have to learn to swim. And fishing. And whistle, dude! - Wait! - No, I'll do it by myself! Mom will probably kill me. Well, you're a man, right? Bring her cherries, she'll eat them and nothing will happen. She'll wash your shirt and shorts. That's what moms do. Sure. She will wash the shirt and shorts. Do you want to drink? I want to, dude. - But won't you shit your pants? - Do not be afraid! I won't. - I know such curses! - Really? But I can't say them in front of my mother. Some people knocked on our door all night long yesterday. She wouldn't let me ride a horse either. - How so you're not studying? - And you? This is David. - He wants to ride a horse. - Why aren't you a horse? - Is that her kid? - Yeah. - Well, he looks like a pig already. Well, see you tomorrow, dude? Mom, I brought you a cherries. - Where did you get them? - Nowhere! I got them with a one guy. With Jakub? I don't know what his name is. We call each other dude. - How? - Dude. He taught me how to climb trees. If he has a scar on his stomach ... ... from appendicitis, then it's him.. We'll go fishing too. And he'll teach me how to swim. Forget it! When Eda wanted to teach you how to swim you didn?t want him to! I can't call Edu a dude. Well, loot it this! And sneakers too! Did you kick the cherries with your feet? It's alright, mom ... Eat! What are you waiting for? I really need to go to... - David! - What? If you overeat a cherries once again, you'be in a big trouble! I hope you didn't drink a water afterwards! A little bit. Just a little bit. And he told me that I'll shit myself! David! Sorry! Do you know what else he has? Knife, jackknife. Well, now you'll feel better. You will see. Look, Mom, there he is! Where? There, with a knitted sweater. Hi dude! What did I tell you! Go to sleep! Why ruin your vacation. You shouldn't let him flunked and you would be okay now. Anyway, he knows he will graduate somehow.. His father healed lot if important people. - What did you tell him? - To grab his things and leave. - And he? - He just packed up and left. Then he let David overeat with cherries and taught him all sorts of nasty things. Well as far as I know David, he didn't have to try too hard. I don't know, Vlasta, how much you know David, but ... Yesterday someone put a chewing gum in my hair. Who was that, what do you think? I'm sorry, but I have ears and eyes. And so do people around. One or two? One is enough. Living as a divorced teacher is tough, dear. And those two cows do not even know. Therefor they can do a stupid things and act like a savages. This girl will sleep with him tonight and in the morning they will not remember, neither of them. And parents will just support them. What do you think is it? School striptease. And when they come to class tomorrow, you gotta behave like nothing happened. Let them show off. If he wants to fail the exam, that's his business. Understand, it doesn't really matter. Prepare a papers, let's write a small test. Haryk, come here! Once again, Haryk! Are you ready? Good boy. Oops! What's his name? What's up. What are you doing there? ?They locked me up. - Yah! And I can't say a "dude" anymore. And I can't be your friend either. You know, I ran to the toilet a hundred times yesterday. Well, at least you had a fun. Where are you going? To catch fish? Take me with you! Do you have a parachute? Jump with a parachute! You can't be with me anyway. Wait a minute! And I won't get dirty in water! And I won't tear my pants! Let's go, Haryk, let's go. Are you kidding me? Do you know who you are? You're a fool! Natural fool! David! Get back in now! Do it! Got it? No, I won't! Are you crazy? You will fall and kill yourself. So what! You said we were going to fish. David! Don't cry and listen! You climb back, and I'll take you with me, okay? Okay, but how? Come on, dude. When can I use infinitive instead of gerund? The beginning of action, expression of feelings ... I like, prefer, start, begin, love. Let's try to come up with examples. Who wants to? I prefer love. I prefer love. David! One two Three. One two Three. Let's row it well! - That's enough! - You almost didn't have to hold me. A couple more times and I'll swim like a fish. There's not too much water today. Did you drink it or something, David? Haryk, get out! Hurry! And you too! - Not yet, you said that we we're gonna go fishing. - I also said that we have no fishing rod. - And we can't really do it without a fishing rod? - Well, only if we drained the whole pond. so the fishes remain at the bottom. - Eda has a pond by the mill. - Who is Eda? - They'll probably get married with my mother. - I see. Can the pond be drained? Sure. There is a gateway over there. If you open it ... ... and water ... Hey, come on, run! Here comes Mommy ... David! Get out! David! Come here now! Or I'll punish you! - I wanted to explain to you that David ... - What else do you want to explain to me? Maybe you think that I will thank you? Your preparation for retake looks ridiculous. Your father will be very surprised! - Follow her. Tell her something. - Don't let her go so mad. - No way! Screw her! Don't cry! Why are you crying? Who happened to you? - Will you punish me? - I will not punish if you tell me... - how did you get out of the room? - On the stairs. - Did he set it up for you? - Yeah. I asked him myself. Well, of course. He is good. I've almost learned to swim. - Why don't you like him? - Whose dog is this? It's Watchman's Haryk. We took him out for a while. - Do you know that he has fleas? - Get in and don't talk. And if you don't eat everything today, I will really punish you. Wait, I forgot my shirt. What is it? Tadpoles. They are there in the mud by the bridge. If you want to, there are many more of them. - Thank you. You really want to take them with you? - Yeah. - Look at Haryk, how well he eats. - Me too. Can I go fishing with Jakub, if I ate everything? After lunch we'll go to Eda's. I'll buy you something on the way. What? Anything you want. A knife like Jakub's. Well if they have knives I'll buy you a knife. And the fishing rod? And the fishing rod too. - He's not bad at all. - Neither is the car. A little step before retirement, life is just beginning. What should I do with revolver like that! It's a toy for kids. - You said you would buy ... - They have no fishing rods nor knives. There is a knife, look. You're going to be like an Indian, huh? - What? - It's plastic! If you wanna whimper, do it outside. Look at this kite! When there is wind, we will let it fly. It will fly great. Kites do not fly in a summer. This one will. - If Jakub helps me, then maybe. - Well, of course you will have to avoid him. Who? He's one of my students. Such a rascal. A kite and one box of chocolates. - The big one? - Yes, the big one. - Well, what did we agree on, David? - We won't touch the clocks. - What else? - We won't touch neighbours' cats either. Great. Such a great memory deserves an award. David! Arms! Go quickly and wash them. Yellow towel, on the edge. - Eda, is there a fish in the pond? - Of course, sir! Carps (a Christmas fish). Like this... - I put them in there two years ago. - Let's go catch them! - Now? There is no time. We'll do that later. - Well then, borrow me a fishing rod! - I only have ones with a spinning reel. When you come here next time, then you will have a small fishing rod. Okay? Yeah... You can take a walk in the garden. There are strawberries. Don't go to the pond. Klara, I really admire you. How can you handle that all? There is a school and a house. And also his temperament! Do you remember the last time he put cats on planks in the water? Well, I guess I will never be like a Bozena Nemcova's grandma. - I'll wash it. - No, you have nothing to do in my kitchen, otherwise you won't get married. Eda, what do you want for dinner? He brought a huge dog with fleas into to the car today. Can you imagine it? By the way, have you ever had any animals? Please... As far as I remember, I have not. Mom didn't want me to. Yes, it will bite or scratch you to a death. But now you have us. No, sorry. Don't be angry, but here it seems like someone is always standing outside the door and listening to us. - Who? - Well, what do you think? She goes through my things I left here and sews back the buttons, just to prove that you and me ... - Well, let's say that I do that. - You? You can't put a thread in a needle. You repair the clocks yourself, yes. And you master the cybernetics of latest generation. I'm proud of you. When I read about you in the newspapers then I say to myself - I know him. I know his forehead, eyes, ears, nose ... I know how helpless he is sometimes ... And sometimes he gets very angry and tries to control himself. You knew about the conference which I must fly to. We said you'd stay here for the whole holidays with David. and that during this time you somehow get along with mom. But you made up the unnecessary English course. As you got scared. As soon as you get back from Brussel I will be here. The courses will last in only two weeks. Let's say I wanted to prove something to myself. That I am me and you are you. - Eda! - What? I would really like you to go out. Right now. What happened? Is it a fire? No. David just drained you pond with carps. - David! - And without any fishing rod! Jakub will be so jealous that I caught the fish before he did. Don't be angry. Why should I be angry? Because of those few fishes? It's not your fault. - I'm sorry. David is my son after all. Well, laws or earth can't control him, he's a real devil. Yes indeed. I never know in advance what comes to his mind. Maybe because he himself does not know. Do not worry. Maybe if you left him with mother for a while... I mean only for a short time. You know that mom is sick. She barely has the strength to take care of herself. He would burn down her house immediately. Well, in that case, it waits for us. - I'm sorry. - Mom! I am coming. What if ... you put him to bed and walk a little more with me? With the risk that this the castle will turn to ashes. You were in a hurry to return to Prague to write an essay. Five minutes, okay? What the hell is happening here? What do you want, spook? I'll tell you something, but you have to give me a sausage. I can't get into the room because the door got slammed. That's because you are a rascal. - I drained the Eda's pond. - You're lying! I'm not. I drained the pond and caught a carp for you. Like his! - Where is it? - They took it from me. I wonder why they didn't break your neck. Let's go, monster. - Are you his dad or what? - What do you think? He has to make everything right somehow. Since you screwed it up for him. "Your preparation for retake seems ridiculous to me." "Your dad will be very surprised!" Look! She pisses me off the most. What a snitch she is. How old are you to talk like this? - You must say "she upsets me" or... - Or what? Here's what she bought for me. In a summer ... Tadpoles are better, right? Yes, this is a wonderful kite, don't be a fool. Do you want some candy? Or lemonade? She went out with Eda. She might get back in the morning. - Do you like her? - No. Me neither. She wanted throw my tadpoles away twice. Don't you want to marry her? Why? Well, we both could be against her together. Wanna play? Another time. It's too late now. Get into bed, I'll turn off the light and I'll stay here a little while till you fall asleep, okay? Just one game! But only one. What are you doing here? What do you want here? Why are you still sitting there? Get out of here, I want to sleep. And we'll talk in the morning. - About what? - How about what? Is this not enough for you? Do I need to call the watchman to thrown you out of here? Get out! I'm sorry, I didn't know you're so completely old. So old. - Mom, are you crying? - No, go to sleep. - Where did you get this knife? - I won it. It's a jackknife! I slammed the door to the room and I couldn't find where our room was. Well, I was afraid while you were gone. - Did he help you find our room? - Yes! I found him by the fire. Do you know what he said? That we have a super kite. Let's go to sleep. Jakub! - Well, are you going or not? - Of course I'm going. The youth went to the cherries. Would you like to see it? - You are responsible for them as much as I am. - I'm not in the mood to babysit anyone. Should we just let them climb a trees? Only you are missing there. Bonfire Jakub Heine. Or did they not take you with them, Romeo from 3th class? Put out the fire! Klara, please watch him doing it at least. Well, what have I done again? Do you want a sweater? There are mosquitoes here. Apparently I'm really getting old. It never occurred to me that David will get out of bed and get bored. - I have to ask your forgiveness. - Why? I understand David. He just has talent to get into troubles like that. How about you? Almost. With one small difference. Everybody immediately forgets the troubles he does. You think so? Today we had a Christmas carp fishing. Doing this in July is a disaster. For me, it's even global one. I would like to explain a lot to you. - Me too. - What, for example? My father's met you to put in a good word, right? Harmonious nature, almost renaissance. I can assume that he asked you for a date. But it looks like you turned him down, so you let me take a blame. - I hope you understand you deserved it? - You are wrong. I did not copy the written exam. And I didn't steal the test from your bag in a staffroom either. Your theory... A man who walks through walls. I was just lucky. Although you didn't believe it. It doesn't really matter now, but some things are just killing me. - Although I seem like I don't care. - For instance? For example, mistrust. You smoke a lot. Sorry, this is none of my business, you're the teacher. And you steal cherries. And you also stole David from me. He wants to fly a kite only with you. Where are these cherries? Stop, stop! Other lovers! So, cherries or Cognac? Cognac! You too. And now you. - Tell her. - Tell her yourself. We thought ... we wanted ... We switched the toilet sign on your door. Screw her! Klara, kiss! Sometimes you want to bury yourself under the ground - And then suddenly ... - Then what? Nothing. Look! You wanted to take revenge on me in front of children. A moon over the river, dude. We said that no later than at 11pm. We still have some rules to follow! The ones who come back later can sleep in the park. Is that you, Kuba? - Tomasek, buddy ... - What are you doing here? Get out! - We want you to warm us little bit ... - Are you crazy?! There's a telegram for you. ... and we'll leave again. - Your relative just died, the funeral is day after tomorrow. Sorry, we didn't know. At least stop yelling. My condolences. - Good night. - Good night. - Good night. - Did you have to say it in fron of her? - What do you mean? How do you think I skive off the English? What was I supposed to say? That I?m late for the boat? Or that wolves hunt nearby Sporilov? Well, call her back and we will explain everything to her together. Do you know Lolobrigida? And while we're at it... Have you seen what she was like? In your sweater ... This is a little warm-up before a test. Textbook, page 164. Means of travel. Who will read it? A lot of people prefer travel by air. Some people on the contrary are afraid of flying. They say, they do not have... Mom, what should I do? Go to play somewhere. We cannot be disturbed. - It's raining there. - Let him stay here. We'll play with him. Go here! - She wants to throw out the kite. And she?s lying! - Who? Mother. She said you went to the funeral. I told you to not bother Jakub. He has his own business. He needs to study. - But he promised me that we will do it together... - It doesn't matter what he did. We will launch the kite ourselves. It?s because you don?t know how! - Do you? - Yeah. Come on! Fly! Be careful with the leash, damn it! Let go of it slowly! That's right. - Why didn't you go to the funeral? - It was a mistake. This aunt already died six months ago. - This is when we wrote the test? - Yeah. You see, we have a very big family. By the way, you got a phone call. They said they will call you back. When? Now? Didn't he introduce yourself? Damn, it flyes well now! - Hello, Klara! - Hello! - Klara! - Hello. Hello, it's me. How come you're back already? No, I won't have time. David is outside. No, it's raining here too but he's playing with a kite on a meadow. Well, let's say in an hour. Of course I want to see you. David! David! Climb down now! Do you hear me? I will buy you a new kite. This was the last one! They don't have it anymore! It's totally wet anyway. We will make another one. Do you hear me, David? Hurry up, otherwise I will beat your ass! Climb slowly. Do not be afraid. I said slowly! You okay? Does it hurt? No, not at all. Didn't you get a hit? No, but I'll hit you right after I get up. You are such a animal! You could have crashed your ass and smashed your face! If you didn't yell at me like this... And you know what? It's over between us. Count on that! - And I will also ll tell your mom everything. - You will not! - I will! - You will not! - I will! Take a look. That will be a massacre. Jakub! You wish... Loos at yourself! What were you doing here? Us? Nothing. - Go and get on. - Where to? To the mill. Why are your knees dirty again? The kite flew up to the tree. I'm not going to any mill. Quiet! We'll be back soon. - Let Jakub go with us. - David! David! Get out! Otherwise I'll beat you ass. David! Jakub, it won't take a long time. You both can wash and dry yourself. Get out, rascal! We'll drain the Eda's pond one more time. Oh my God! Lovestory part one and maybe part two already? I?m lost. We'll come here for the holidays when mom's classes will end. Look! One tube for every each day. I still can't understand why didn't he wait for me. Well he waited half an hour. What more do you want? He knows what kind of car I have. You could have come for me. I don't know, maybe he just wanted to stay with me. This is what you have to get used to with Eda. He was in a hurry. Here is the letter he left. It will be hard to drive during this strong rain. And he has to be on a plane in the morning. Go to get some tea. David! Maybe you first visit a bathroom, huh? Yes of course. Did you have an argument? Fifty fifty. Klara, who is this guy that came with you? Jakub? - My student. Son of the doctor Heina. - Yah! That surgeon? What are you doing? Why do you wipe it there? - There are spots. - Aha ... - Don't be angry, we recently changed the upholstery. - Yes of course. I've never sat in a paper chair in my life. Not bad at all. We could draw something on it too, right? Milk? Here is sugar. There are wonderful forests here. Silence, lot of blueberries ... And there are so many mushrooms that you don't even know what to do with them. Last year we dried two kilograms of them. When you settle down with us, you can go with me. I'll show you my secret spots. - I apologize. - It's alright, Jakub. Forgive me for being so informal to you ... If you are interested in something here, for example this clock ... This is hell, isn't it?? To come here and stretch all the 69 clocks. Only 69. I knew a certain doctor Heina in Budejovice. This was an uncle who died to anglina. Maybe you wanted to say angina? The exact diagnosis is anglina pectoris. My aunt had a same fate. It's time for us to go, Klara. You are very tired. Don't be mad at us, but she needs to evaluate some tests. And David must go to bed. Indeed. We forgot about David. They played with a kite together with Jakub. Now I need him to go to a bathroom and wash him well. - How old are you Jakub? - Almost 20. - So you're 18. Remember when we used to be 20 ... Huh, Klara? How old are you, 28? Eda will be 50 and I don't even wanna speek about my age. - You and Jakub are relatives? - No. And there's something else, Klara ... Just don't be mad. Eda said that you are going to get married in an October. And when I asked him about David ... Well, of course I'm not talking about holiday now, that is not a problem. But you seem to want to continue teaching. - Have you solved this issue somehow? - Yes, sort of. - What do you mean by sort of? - Will you send him to your mother? - No. You don't understand anything or what? I can directly see her sitting down at the table, taking the paper and writing. Dear Eda, no matter how unpleasant it is to me, I have to tell you .. You shouldn't have taken me with you. What was that about? - A snobbish mill with a bunch of clocks. - Did they give you a tea? They did. Respect to the father too. You shouldn't have talked to me informally in front of her either. It wasn't fair. Sorry. - Yesterday ... - What yesterday? You were different. Apparently, because the moon was shining. A mill with a bunch of clocks, fine. He has a mansion in Prague for sure. - Future husband Dr. Dr. Sc ... - You forgot about the pond. And we can't forget about a pond without carp. Cool. Ando also shit load of money, so he will shower his sweetheart with jewels... - ...and dress her in furs... - Simply a fairy tale. So what is next? - In fairy tales, Jakub is Kuba, right? - Yeah, the dumbest one. Kuba... I am glad that I took this course. I need 300 crowns for food, but I can save another 500. So David will have boots and a coat for the winter. You certainly don't understand it yet. But even if do... I cannot be alone all the time. - At least for David's sake, I can't. - David and I have already a deal. We'll take you. - You and David. - Yeah. We'll go to museums on weekends to look at the whales. And feed the monkeys. He will be like a brother to me. - You go to sleep. - How wonderful! Tomorrow I'll order myself a lace dress. And with a veil. Will a dozen roses be enough? And a bag of peanuts? Mom, who are a bridesmaids? Be quiet! You should be in a bed already. And let's go to the Zoo on a honeymoon trip. I'll be your lamp, Mom. Stay here. - Is there a spare wheel? - Nope, shit. I forgot to send it in for repair. I need new tires, but I can only buy them if I won the lottery. Can you belive it? He didn't even slow down. David, get out. There is an umbrella in the back. - There is no umbrella here. - Well, then the raincoat is in there. What big is the whale? Like that tree? Even more. Do not sleep! You will be in bed in an hour. Let's go! Let's do a carousel. - Dad used to jump with me as well. - Really? - Hop-hop-hop ... - You are crazy! Hop-hop-hop ... Focus. You're doing a retake now. The infinitive can be used instead of the gerund for verbs indicating... (you can't translate those words, it's not important haha) - Verbs indicating... - Don't laugh. Retaking can change your whole life . - To indicate... - Changes, start of action, feelings... Textbook, page 144. I start, I begin, I prefer, I like... - Take this to the bathroom. - Ok. - You hurt yourself with this curtain on. - Which curtain? You wanted a white dress. - This is crazy. - What's crazy? Maybe I'm just dreaming... Now I'll fall asleep, then I'll wake up... And you're here again. We'll fall asleep in the morning class. I'd rather fall asleep here. With you. Do you want? Don't lie. - I have a feeling for you. - So do I. Can you lie? Let's say we went for a walk and met by chance. - See you. - See you. I hope nobody saw you. I went for a walk and... Klara, you can hate me and consider me as a skeptical fool but I have to tell you that This is madness. You're his teacher. You successfully divorced one fool and what are you doing again? How old is he? 18? You already have one child, isn't it enough for you? - Were you okay with me and Eda? - Yes. Even if he was 80. - Men have the right to certain things. - But not me? Yesterday there was an old, tired, indecisive woman. Smart, reasonable. A moon was shining over the river and everything was filled with magic sounds. Even if it's the only night like this, you can still envy me. Do you want some cherries? They are stolen. Or this ring? Take him. You'll give me a pleasure. Here you go. It suits you very well. The handle is longer and curved. I don?t understand him anyway. - I am okay with that. If there was a male teacher, maybe thirty years old... - And with a mustache! - Where is he? With a mustache ... - Jakub, is she a virgin? Tell me! - Details! Give the details! - Does she have a birthmark? - And where? - How do you say it in English? There must be something in it, huh? - Well, confess, Jakub. - Be our friend. - What do you care? No, there is no hickey. Are you having fun? You haven't seen yours evaluated tests yet. After I give them to you, we'll have even more fun. Please erase it. I thought you were an adults and not a children. Get ready. Lesson 22. Well, I wish you all the best! Warm bread, hot coffee. And be on time for the train. - Are you nuts? - I am not. Everyone knows immediately everything in here, even news that are not real. For instance? The fact you've already passed the retake. Another theory says it was a revenge. A pleasant revenge. Sleep with her and say - "I don?t know English, but you don't know other stuff." - Wanna a soup? - Yes. Can I? Jakub, You better sit at another table. - Why? - Too many eyes. - So what? Mom, why should Jakub sit at another table? So you don't splash me with soup. And you eat everything! Do not sip! - Are you going to swim? - Will you come with us, David? If mom lets him go. Can I take a ball with me, mom? Borrow me a twenty bucks. I'll give it back to you in Prague tomorrow. Thanks. Do you wana go too? Maybe I'll arrive for both of you later. You can say you're doing this all for David in the end. Tomorrow is the last day of July. Farewell party. We're leaving. Do you even know that? Very clearly. I know many more stuff now. I have a friend who works in Prahaimport. She goes on maternity leave and I will work there instead of her. Maybe I've never been a very good teacher. Raising kinds is a very difficult. One diploma is not enough for this. Don't worry, no more retakes for him. So what is next? I have no intention to pretend anything. Jakub and I are sleeping together and you know that. I have a feling for him. Sometimes he's so childish that I would kill him. And sometimes very grown-up. I only know one thing - he likes David. And if I look ridiculous, I don't care at all. - Do you have a glass? - Yes, five-liter. What are you doing there? We're catching a tadpoles. But they have already grown into small frogs. Eh, I didn't catch anything. I've already decided everything. We will have many children. David, two girls and three boys. A whole team of wonderful rascals. Then we will grow old and die in one day. And they will shower us with flowers. Don't be a fool. - Can you even notice what I want to tell you something. - What do you mean? Do you want me to notice you like this? With a fingers? With a fingers. Look what I traded. Pipe for a stupid burst ball. - It will be useful on the river for us. - Show me. - So it's cracked as well. - Which river? I wrote to my parents. I still have a holiday, right? - What did you write to them? - All. About you. That you have a little boy. I want you to meet them. You know my father and you just have to praise mother's cooking. You are crazy? You will be kicked out of the house. Well, I'll move in with you. David said that I can. I can work in the subway and study in the evenings. If I want something, I will achieve it. Except of fixing this. It's impossible. Show me your hands! And the legs? Run into the water to wash yourself! - Draw something for Jakub. - What? I can draw a dog best. Well, maybe a carousel. And Alena, Olina, Milena, Elena, Slavena on it... - There is no Slavena here. - It does not matter. We wish him a hundred beautiful girls. And with hundred of the most beautiful children. And thank him. For what? For what? For the cherries and for the kite. But we're too scared to go to on the river with him. I'm not. I drew the ship.. It's me. This is Jakub.. I didn't draw you. You're downstairs in the kitchen making tea for us. You better go to put on your jacket. Where are you going? - Are you crying? - No. Just smoke got into my nose. We will give him this letter and we will carry things to the car. Klara, where is your mask? David, I have a first dance with you, don't forget! Mom, won't we go there with a costumes on? - Jakub promised me the captain's cap. - Let's go. - Do you want to run away? - Why should I run away? And you said that Jakub will come with us. You did! It doesn't matter if I did, get into the car seat and stop talking. - Some of us must be smart. - I'm already smart. You and two others. We forgot the kite. And a glass with tadpoles. - And also... - Why are you doing there? - I need to go somewhere to... - Couldn't you go before we left? Nope. Because you were in a hurry. David! David! Don't be crazy! David! David, come back! David! One, two, three... Again. One, two, three! What's wrong with you? We knock on your door and no answer. - Where have you been? - We... - You better wipe your nose. - Hi, Klara. Now the fun begins. Olina confesses her love to Tomas. Russian teacher dressed as a mermaid and dances with fairies in the park. You said that I would be the captain. Well, there you go, the captain. And I will turn you into a pretty little monster too. - Stay still! - You said a little monster. - But a pretty one. Did you find a letter? Which letter? None. I hope you liked it, I can't wait for an analysis! :) Although I think the second part was kinda boring.
