(dramatic music) (saxophone playing) (dog whines) (suspenseful music) (coins clink) - [Man] Hi, Johnny. How's it going tonight? - Good. (grunting) (uptempo music) (punches thudding) (yells) (bones crack) Don't move! - [Man] Harley. Harley, look. Look. Harley. (camera shutter clicking) - Get Me McGraw. We have a confirmed kill, sir. That's affirmative. Yes, sir. - If a line contains the origin 0, 0, we can find a second point on that line by substituting some value other than 0 for X or Y. Okay, class. Tonight, I'd like you to do lessons six, seven, and nine, chapter 22. (bell ringing) Have a good day, class. - I'm out of here. - Oh, and I'll be in my office today for an hour if you have any questions. Chris, I'd like to talk to you. - See ya. - [Teacher] I noticed you got in pretty late last night. - Yeah, what about it? - When I tell you something, I expect you to do as I say. I told you to be in by 11. - So I was a little late. - Two hours is more than a little late. You know, we go through this every time. I don't know what you expect me to do. - You don't have to do anything, Rick. - Dad. - No, I mean Rick. Don't worry about me. You haven't for 15 years. Why start now? (subdued music) (upbeat music) (people chattering) - Should I ask him? - Honey, you better because he's not gonna ask you or anybody else for that matter. - Oh, he's just shy. Are you sure he's not attached? - Not as far as I know. Good luck. (knocking on door) - Hi, I'm Marilyn Daily. I'm substituting for Mr. Green for the rest of the year. - Hello. I'm Rick Cowan. - I was wondering if you were going with anyone to the awards banquet on Friday night. And if not, would you like to go with me? - Friday? - You're seeing someone. I should've known. I'm really sorry. - No, I'm not. I have a son, Chris, but his mother and I were never married. She died in a car accident two years ago. - Oh, I'm sorry. (bell ringing) Well, I better be going. - No, wait. I would like to go out with you Friday. - Great. Well, we'll talk later then. - I look forward to it. (uptempo music) - Dude, she's scoping you out. Go for it. Older girls screw around. - Hi, I'm Chris. - Hi, Chris. - Interested in going out Friday? - What makes you think I would want to go out with you? Do I look like a child molester? - No, you look like you're impressed with me. - I'm not impressed with you. - [Chris] Yeah, you are. - Well, look who it is. (laughs) This geek bothering you, Debbie? - Here's your chance. You want that date, impress me. - Hey, Cowan. Your old man's a dick. He gave me an F. - Your dad's Mr. Cowan? The teacher? - I see you brought my radio. - It's not your radio, asshole. - Now who's the asshole, asshole? - [Debbie] Stop it, Nick. - [Chris] Let me go, goddamn it. - [Nick] I asked you a question. Who's the asshole? Come on. Come on, I'm not hearing you. Come on. I'm not hearing anything. (Nick laughs) - I am. - That's what I like to hear. See, we told Chris that if he gave us his fancy radio, we wouldn't kick his ass every day. - [Bully] We lied. - You said if I impressed you you'd go out with me, right? Right? - Yeah, okay. - Hey, check this out, huh? (electricity zapping) (yelling) (people laughing) - I'll pick you up at eight. (yelling) - [Nick] Get out of my way! You're a dead man, Cowan! I'm gonna kill you! - I'm sorry, Mr. Bartoli. Thank you. Chris! Chris, come down here! That was Nick's father on the phone. He's gonna be fine, luckily. Where did you learn how to make a bomb? - Look, I told you. It wasn't a bomb. All I did was give him a little shock. Besides, I could've made it a hell of a lot bigger if I'd wanted to. - How many times do I have to tell you? The first man to raise. - Raise a fist, is the first man to run out of ideas. I know. What did you expect me to do, Rick? Stand there like a pussy and just let those guys beat on me? - You could've come to me. I'm your father. You have a problem, you come talk to me. - Yeah, well that would've been great to do growing up, but oh, that's right, you weren't there. - I can only say I'm sorry so many times. - Yeah? Well, say it again. - You know, you're about this close to military school. - Great. At least it'll get me the hell away from you. (tense music) (gun firing) - Stay down. (grunting) (table clattering) (gun firing) Are you all right? - Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I think so. - Get me some paper. - What? - [Rick] Get me some paper! - Paper. Who are these guys? Where did you... Where did you learn to fight like that? Talk to me, goddamn it! What the hell's going on here? Aren't you gonna tell me to watch my mouth? Wow. That's the best conversation we've had in months. - Let's just say my past has finally caught up to me. (uptempo music) - Can I help you, sir? - I need to see Michael Powell. - There is no Michael Powell here. - Just call him and tell him it's MacReady. - [Guard] There is no Powell here. - I know the procedure. I worked for the agency. Just make the call. - Listen, pal. You've got no clearance. You're out of here. (grunting) - [Rick] Come on! - Code Red on seven. Code Red on seven. - I want to see Powell. - There's no Mr. Powell here. - Freeze! (grunting) - I wouldn't do that if I were you. (clapping) - Bravo, Mac. Glad to see you haven't lost your delicate touch. I can't tell you what a surprise it is to see you here, Mac. What's it been, two years? Two years. Italiano. Interesting. - What the hell kind of ink is this? - B negative. - On notebook paper, no less. Cute. - You know, Pressburger, there was a time around here when I was almost as arrogant as you. - All right. Enough already. I see some things never change. The issues at hand are these. One, you've been targeted for death by a hit team. Two, they've underestimated you. Three, next time, they won't. - But who are they and why are they after us? - How much does the boy know? - The boy doesn't know jack and he's getting a little pissed. - I see he's got your sparkling personality, Mac. - Chris, I used to work for the CIA. Mr. Powell was my boss. - You, in the CIA? What, like James Bond? Come on. - I operated out of Italy from 1985 to '93. - He was a surveillance expert for our covert operations. - He was the best. An artist. - And what about all this Mac stuff? - That's my real name. George MacReady. - So let me get this straight. My father used to be a CIA secret agent, Cowan isn't my real last name, and now someone from your past is trying to kill us? - You made a lot of enemies in your time with the agency, Mac. It would be difficult to determine who could be coming back for revenge. But with a little time, and your help, I can find out. Providing, of course, certain stipulations are met by you. - Such as? - Come back to me, Mac. I've never had a right-hand man that equaled you. Then when we find out who they are, you take 'em out yourself. - You know, you never did have the balls to find those people who took out your little girlfriend. Maybe it's the same ones. - What's he talking about? - Covert ops, which you were really good at, Mac. - I'm not coming back, Michael. Ever. - Very well. We've been through a lot together, Mac, as friends and as colleagues. I can't force you to come back with us. But if you stay as civilian, you can't have security clearance. All I can do is put you and Chris in a safe house until I can find out who's responsible. Fair enough? (suspenseful music) (explosion booms) - How did Mom die? Really? - It was a car bomb. It was meant for me. - Did Mom know about everything? - Yes. (birds chirping) (vehicle approaching) - Hi, Mac. (slow guitar music) - Glad to see Michael hasn't lost his touch for surprises. Danielle, this is my son Chris. - It's nice to meet you. Your dad's always bragged about you. - Has he? - Mm-hmm. Come on. There's a small cabin up ahead. It's not much, but I think you'll like it. - Do you have any idea how long we're gonna have to stay here? I've got a date Friday night. - You're gonna be here longer than that. (scoffs) - Is Powell sure this place is secure? - Yes. You know, when Michael told me what happened, I made a few calls of my own. Your former team members, Flannaghan and Lanson, they've been assassinated. - When? - Monday and just last night. The squad, who my sources believe are responsible, works independently. Mutually for the Italian intelligence. - Do you think he'd have anything to do with Leoni? - Could. - What do you suggest I do? - Take 'em out, Mac. If you don't, you and Chris, you'll be targets for the rest of your lives. - [Man] There they are! (guns firing) - [George] Get down! (dramatic music) (guns firing) - Come on! (gun firing) (grunts) - Hey! (guns firing) That way. (grunting) (bones crack) (gun firing) (grunting) (gun firing) (grunts) - I'll get ya. (grunting) (phone beeping) (speaking foreign language) - Did you get everybody? - I don't know. I think I got 'em all. Come on, we gotta go. - I thought we were supposed to be safe here. - We're not. - I'll take you back to Powell. - Now way, it's not safe. There's a leak somewhere. - Then where are we gonna go? - To see an old friend of mine. Know where I can find the major? - No, we can't go there. I don't trust him. - Do you have any other suggestions? - So, where are we going? - Ireland. - Ireland? (upbeat music) - What the hell is he doing in... Oh, shit. That's just what we need. Ireland. Now what? The last thing we need is an international incident. Especially when things are cooling down over there. - Well, I think a couple of US government emissaries should go over there and help keep things quiet. After all, maybe Mac could use a little help. - And we're just the guys to do it, huh? - Always did love a good Guinness on tap. (slow guitar music) - Now, Rick. Will you stay here? Now the major, he'll be down in a minute. And in the meantime, I'll look after the luggage. - Thanks. (elegant guitar music) - How are you, my boy? You're looking wonderful. - I'd say you're doing pretty well for yourself. Retirement must agree with you. - Yeah, nice pad. - Well, you might say that some of my investments paid off. - I'm better off not knowing, I'm sure. - This your boy? - Hi, I'm Chris. - Hi, Chris. Fine looking chap. - He was lucky. He had a beautiful mother. - Ms. Mendelsohn. - Sir. - I understand that you've had a spot of trouble. - Yes, sir. I didn't know where else to go. - No need to explain, lad. You did the right thing. According to Ms. Mendelsohn's sources, these chaps operate out of Italy. - Yes, sir. - And could you tell me who gave you this information? - You know I can't tell you that. - No, I know. I'm sure you can't. Tell me, what did Mr. Powell have to say about this? - Nothing. - I'm not surprised. He's due for a promotion soon, isn't he? - Mm-hmm. That's right. - Well, bully for him. That's what he always wanted, position and power. - No, no, no, no. You're not hearing me. I want all the information. Everything you've got. And I want it yesterday. Good. We've got great things in store for us, Emeric. - Yeah? Sometimes I'm not so sure. - I don't want to hear talk like that. We're this close from running the whole show at Langley. After six months in office, they'll wonder why they didn't give us the position 10 years ago. We have the opportunity to completely reinvent US intelligence. Emeric, it's our destiny. - That's what I like about you, sir. Always the optimist. - This is my pride and joy. I managed to link into a satellite system that is hooked up to every intelligence database in the world. A while we were gabbing, Bernard fed the information supplied to us by Ms. Mendelsohn into the computer. So we should be getting an answer shortly. - Since when do you need a machine to do your thinking for you? You must have some idea who these guys are. - Michelangelo Leoni. - That's what I thought. - Who is Michelangelo Leoni? - Italy's answer to JFK. He was a rising star in the socialist party in to 80s. - So what happened? - I was ordered to monitor his activities in '92, but something went wrong. He found out about our operation. There was a firefight and Leoni was killed. - So? - I'm the one who killed him. We managed to pin the killing on a radical opposing party, but obviously not everyone was fooled. (keyboard clacking) - Ah. I believe our answers have arrived. (printer humming) These are all the Italians with intelligence backgrounds that match those which Ms. Mendelsohn's sources provided. - That's him. - Carlo Gianini. Well, let's get to know Mr. Gianini a little better, shall we? (keyboard clacking) Carlo Gianini, born Corleone, Sicily nine May of 1960. Served with distinction in Italian army. Discharged 1986. Joined Red Brigades the following year. Helped mastermind kidnapping and murder of Italian government official Aldo Colinari, 1988. One of the Brigade's few surviving members. Went freelance once the Brigades disbanded. - The Red Brigade, great. So the socialists tracked me down and hired Gianini to finish the job they botched two years ago. (keyboard clacking) - Seems like our boy has followed you here. - So what are we gonna do now? (tense music) (people chattering) - You, wait outside. I take him myself. (people chattering) - Lose the gun. - Fuck. - I want names. - [Man] What's going on there? (glass shatters) (grunting) (uptempo music) - Hey. (grunting) - Come on. (gun firing) (yelling) - Hold it! - Just keep 'em up. (gun firing) (grunting) (guns firing) (gun clicks) (metal scraping) (metal clanking) (heart beating) (gun firing) (sirens wailing) - All right, hands up. - Officer, if you could just reach into my pocket you will see I'm here on a diplomatic visa. I have a license for this gun. - Okay. Then who's responsible for this bloody mess? - That man there. He just killed my bodyguards. I will be happy to file any kind of report you need me to, sir. - Okay, thank you. We'll talk later. Guard, I want all those people moved out of the way. - Yes, sir. All right. Nothing to see. Clear the area. Please, move along. - Say goodbye to your kid. - Stop! - Now you just cool it, boyo. - You can't let him leave. He's going after my son. - What? Who is he? - He's Richard Cowan, 5630 South Rockingham Drive, Los Angeles, California. - A yank? I hate yanks. I once took my wife during a holiday. Worst time of my life. - You can't just let him get away. - Ever heard of diplomatic immunity, son? Take him to the station. Mark, I want this street taped off now. (grunting) (engine starts) (gun firing) (tires squealing) Go, go, go! Go, go, go, go, go! Get that thing out of the way! Move it, move it! (gun firing) - Lose the son of a bitch. (guns firing) (tires squealing) - Updates on Gianini? - Yes. Mr. Gianini hasn't visited Italy in the last five years. He's operated exclusively out of the US. Your sources weren't as well informed as you thought, my dear. - What about the documents that prove he's been working in Italy? - Forgeries. Quite obviously somebody had access to the data bank. Somebody who wants us to think Gianini is working for the OSPP. - Okay. Who could that be? - Well... But of course, of course. (gun fires) (tense music) - Get the boy. Keep him alive. We still might need him. (uptempo music) (engines racing) (engine revving) (metal crunching) - Come on, get out. Who do you work for? (yells) (grunts) (grunting) Come on. (grunting) (electricity zapping) (explosion booming) (siren wailing) - Freeze! Don't you move. Watch him, he's quick. - Excuse me, sir. Still no word from Gianini. - We move on. - All right. Let's go through it one more time. - My name is George MacReady. I've been living undercover as Rick Cowan. I'm a former covert operative for the Central Intelligence Agency. During the past 48 hours, numerous attempts have been made on my life and the life of my son by an Italian hit squad operating out of the US. I came here to ascertain who they are and who they work for. They followed me here and. - So, Mr. Covert Operative. I spoke with the Los Angeles Police Department. They'd very much like to talk to you. Have you any idea how many people you've killed back in Los Angeles? - Powell should've taken care of that. - I'm afraid I've got some bad news for you, my friend. We got a return call from Langley, Virginia. They cannot confirm, or deny, your association with the agency. And the other number you gave us, the major's, no answer. - Look, they could have my son. Gianini was just a hired hand. - By who? - I don't know. Please, just send a car to the address I gave you for the major. - Look, the other day we had a bloke in here who insisted for six hours that he was the Tooth Fairy, but that doesn't mean that I let him pull my teeth. Now, I want some straight answers. - I've told you everything I know. - All right, all right. That's enough. Maybe a few nights in jail would jar Mr. Rambo's memory, huh? Lock him up. - [Chris] Shit! - Mr. MacReady, I'm Agent Stanton. I've gotten the police to drop all charges against you. - You work for Powell. - No, sir. I'm from Langley. It's Powell we want to talk to you about. (suspenseful music) - Bingo. - Mr. MacReady, this is Agent McGrath. He's head of our department and leading the investigation into Powell. - You're lucky we got to you when we did. I'm sure you're aware that the other potential witnesses have been taken out. - What's this all about? - We're aware that you and your team were involved in the Leoni assassination. We believe you were set up. - What do you mean set up? - It seems Powell got nervous that he couldn't keep American influence alive in Italy. If that happened, his career would be over. - Which is why he had you and your team take Leoni out. Powell provided Leoni's men with your team's position. - Why my team? - Powell figured you'd take Leoni out and your team was expendable. - Look, we're wasting time here. My son is in danger. - We'll deal with that at the appropriate time. - Mr. MacReady, once we obtain enough information from you to conclude our investigation into Powell, we can go look for your boy. I mean, we know that he and Pressburger followed you here. They should be easy to locate. - They're here? Look, you want any more information out of me, we go get Chris now. - Mr. MacReady, we know what we're doing. I'm afraid you'll just have to do things our way. (uptempo music) (suspenseful music) - Chris! Major! (subdued music) (phone ringing) Hello? - [Michael On Phone] Nice job with Gianini, Mac. You really haven't lost a thing. You want your boy to live? Be at the ship docks in an hour. (dial tone humming) - I told you Gianini couldn't handle Mac. Should've let me take him. - Well, look on the bright side. With Gianini dead, that saves us the trouble of paying him. I'd say it's all worked out quite well so far. - But what about Mac? - What about him? Nothing he can do now. Have this thing ready to pull out as soon as he arrives. - Whatever you say, sir. (suspenseful music) (footsteps tapping) - What are you looking at, shithead? - Shut up. - Did your mom have any kids that lived? - You're pretty cocky for a kid on death row. (chuckles) (suspenseful music) (tense music) - Don't move, Mac. - Danielle? Where's Chris? - Inside. He's fine. - Why, Danielle? - What can I say, Mac? It's nothing personal. It's just business. - [George] What does Powell want? - You in exchange for Chris. I promise that we'll let him go. - You expect me to believe that? - What choice do you have, Mac? - Sir, he's here. - The guest of honor has arrived. (laughs) Glad you could make it, Mac. - Where's my son? - He's below. - All this because you were afraid you wouldn't get your promotion? - There are always so many questions when someone moves up the chain of command. - You're all crazy. (gun cocks) - You have no idea how to deal with men of power. - Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh. When the company started doing their check on me, I knew I couldn't risk the truth coming out about Leoni. You see, you and your team were the only link to my involvement with the hit. - You planted that car bomb. - That's right. Now I can finish the job I started two years ago. - Get the boy. - Get us out of here! (suspenseful music) - Your old man's here. What's the matter, badass? No more cracks about my mother? - Um, okay. You know what your mother and a football have in common? Pig skin. - All right, that's enough. - You know the only difference between your mother and a pile of garbage. - I said, that's enough, goddamn it. - Garbage gets picked up. - You know, kid, you got a lot of guts. (tense music) - You all right, son? - Yeah. Better, now that you're here. - Let the boy go. - You're kidding me, right? There's no telling how much he knows. - Look, the only thing I know about is fixing radios. 20, 19, 18, 17, 16. - Like father like son. Nice try, kid. Kill them both. - My pleasure. - Three, two, one! - Get down! - Oh, shit! (explosion booms) - Fire on deck. Fire on deck. - This way. (coughing) - Danielle? Danielle? Danielle. Danielle? Danielle. Danielle! I want those bastards. - We've gotta find someplace for you to hide. What are you doing? - I'm going for help. - Are you sure? - Don't worry, I can make it. - I'll keep 'em busy as long as I can. Good luck. - You too. (uptempo music) - O'Leary. O'Leary. We've just received a call about some explosions and gunshots going on on a ship out in the bay. - Call John Brady. Tell him I want his boat ready to leave in five minutes. What the hell's going on in this town? - Hell if I know. (uptempo music) (bones crack) (grunting) (yelling) (gun firing) (grunts) (grunting) (bones crack) (gun firing) (yelling) (tense music) (gun firing) (metal clangs) (grunting) (yelling) - Man in water! Okay, shut her down. (gun firing) - You're not gonna escape, Mac! - The company's been up your ass for the last six months, Michael! They know you set me up to hit Leoni! Give it up! It's over! - Nothing is over! I'll always be employable, Mac. And you? You will always be dead. (gun firing) (gasping) - [O'Leary] You okay, son? - [Chris] Yeah. - Get me a blanket. What's your name? - Chris Cowan. - Cowan? MacReady. Christ! Get me to that ship, quick. (tense music) (gun firing) (grunts) (gun firing) (grunts) (grunting) - They'll stop anybody who might get in their way. That's why they've been trying to kill him. - [Policeman] There's some activity on the deck. Two men. Hard to make them out. (grunting) - 15 minutes? Well, make it quick. We won't have backup for another 15 minutes. (grunting) (bones crack) (punches thudding) (grunting) Attention. Attention on deck. Stop it. Stop right there. This is the police. Put up your hands and surrender. (gun firing) (grunting) (subdued music) - Drop your weapons. I'm taking the boat. Drop 'em. You drop it, Mac. I said drop it! - You're not gonna get away with it Powell. - You haven't got the guts. (gun firing) - I'll check with the captain later. - Captain, I think you'll want to see this over here, sir. - Just send more ambulances and backup, okay? Hey! I want you to come down to the station and answer some questions, Mr. Cowan. Lots of questions. - Looks like you're gonna have to wait your turn. - Mr. MacReady. - Cowan. - Right. Look, there's no hard feelings about what happened, but we still need some more info for the investigation. - There's your investigation. That's all the info you need. - Cowan, where the hell do you think you're going? - Detective O'Leary. Talk to him. (slow guitar music) How's the hand? - It'll be all right. - Chris, I hope you understand. I'm finally free of my past. And I'll never lie to you again. I love you. - I love you, too. Dad. - That must've been really hard to say. - [Chris] (chuckles) Yeah. - Don't worry, your secret's safe with me. - So's yours. - [George] What day is it? - [Chris] Thursday, I think. - [George] Thursday. You know, if we hurry, we can still make our dates Friday. - [Chris] You have a date? - I do. - [Chris] Wow. Well then, we only have one problem. - [George] What's that? - [Chris] No one's ever gonna believe our excuse for missing school. (subdued music)
