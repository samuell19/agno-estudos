Go apeshit. Whoo! Ruthie! Cooking with gas. How many people died here? Not people... women. Will you grab that bag. Here we go, then. Mo-o-m? We're ba-a-ck! Oh, my God. Can we stay by the good pool? Yeah. Anything you want, baby. Oh, you can just put that anywhere. Hi. - Let's drink. - We're here. We are, like, so excited you could be there, but seriously? We probably won't need these, but... Do you want to explain... - Here she comes. - Hey... Here she comes. Well, it doesn't seem that haunted. It isn't. Is the pool on? Hi? We're he-e-re! Ruthie, is the pool on? Ah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Which kitchen do you want to use? Both, of course. So you own this place? Yes, it's all ours. Ruthie inherited it. Not for long. Hey, you said you'd keep an open mind. My God, one online class and you're ready to take on hospitality forever. Did you even watch those videos I sent you? Okay. Okay. I don't... I don't want to get into it right now. We did it. We're here. I'm gonna put these up on two. The bones are good. Better than I remember. Can I pee anywhere? What? Not, like, on the carpet. You know, I just mean can I take a room or what? Yeah. Just stay off three. There was some flooding, and we're not insured. - Two is your oyster. - Okay. Okay. You hooked up with her again? Like, she is so... Ruthie hates her. She has cancer. - What? - I mean, she doesn't. She thought she did, but she doesn't anymore. Wow. She got a call from her doctor this morning. It felt rude to just, you know, leave her. - Wow. - This is so typical. "Methods in Hospitality." When you first acquire or inherit a hotel, three factors emerge... One, timing; two... "Methods in Hospitality." It's a mistake to think of a hotel as just four walls. Whether that's an escape from one's regular life or an invitation, think of a hotel as not just a space but an experience. In hospitality, we curate a world that allows one to escape their life but sometimes can encourage one's darker tend... You're actually watching it. Yeah. I told you I would. I really think we can make this place great. There's way more potential here than I remembered, and the room count is like a third higher. I've only just started on the inventory stuff, but it's not bad. That's what actually helps with the loan. - Cal. - What? I'm still meeting with that agent and the lawyers. That's why we're here. I know. I know that. Just remember that your grandma left this place to you, not your mom. Stop. Your mom just wants you to sell it and give her... Stop. Just wants you to sell it so she can buy back that condo in Florida. I just want to fix things between us. That's all I want. - I know. - I love you. - What is wrong with you? - Everything. - I got you! - Oh, my! Stop. The whiskey. I need it. I'm not waiting. Whoo! Hey! We got to put the food in the fridge! Hey! Five deaths in 30 years is not that many for a hotel of this... Scopes Landing had four deaths in a single fire. I think ghosts are gonna be really good for the brand. They are. I'm not scared. I love ghosts. I can see them. Whoa. The joggers are my favorite. They weren't just, like, joggers. They were models. Fashion-model joggers. And they were here on a shoot on location. And they went out one morning to go on a jog and got in a fight and never came back. One of them tried to crawl back, but she got lost in the woods, and they found her, and she had leaves that she had tried to make into a bandage for her injury. Good detail. Women do bad things, yeah. Oh, my God. There's a man standing at the door. - Hey. - Brian. Um, she isn't here yet. And you... You can't just come in here. You asked me to set up the pool. Doesn't just happen by itself, so... Brian, these are my friends. Everyone, this is Brian. What's up? Uh, he works here sometimes. My mom's friend or whatever. Yeah, whatever, heh. Hey, you notice anything? I lost 17 pounds. I cut out fruits, cut out carbs. Yeah, I don't get it. It's like, one minute, your mom and I, we're good, we're eating hors d'oeuvres, we're making plans. And then I can't get her to call me back. I mean, you know, I told you not to give her money, right? Huh. All right. - Wait. Where are you going? Do a faucet sweep on three, 'cause we're not gonna get another freeze, so... Brian, she's not up there. Yeah, but her car is outside. I just want to check her room. Wait, her room? Yeah, she has a room here. She stayed here for a little while. But her car doesn't work, and I can do the faucets. Look... your mother made some promises to me. You don't understand her. You know? You'll never understand her. Uh-huh. - I'm sorry, man. Yeah. I fucking hate guys like that. They act all, like, fatherly and flirty at the same time. Reminds me of my brother. I thought you didn't have any family? Stepbrother. I feel like every Brian I have ever met looks, talks, and acts just like that. You seriously think you could be happy running a hotel? I think it sounds fun. Hotel proprietor. And it's not like we would be cleaning the rooms ourselves or, like, at the front desk. We would hire a management company or franchise it. So do you want to tell me why you brought her? You want to tell me why you're still with her? We're actually doing really well. Mm. You really think she isn't going to cheat on you again? How can you... She's not gonna cheat on me again. In fact, I think she's gonna propose this weekend. I'm gonna go find another whiskey. Mads, wait. Don't get all tough.

Why can't you sleep? Ow, fuck. I'm really sorry. Um, are you... are you okay? Ow. Oh, shit. It is bad. Okay, I'm gonna go get something. - It's fine. - No, no. I'll be right back.

My mom isn't coming. She texted. Are you okay? You want to talk about it? - Let's go. Where are we going? I want them to come. Shh! We don't want to wake her up. I think she's having a nightmare. Oh, come on, admit it. You wish you hadn't brought her. Oh, my God, you're right. I don't know what I was thinking. Let's go. Ohh, I love those chairs. Stop. No. Who even stays in a hotel anymore anyway? - Your mom does. - Oh! Oh! Maddie? Maddie? Oh, fuck. Maddie? Guys? Maddie? Oh. I... I thought this place was pretty much empty. Uh, I'm actually looking for the owner. Uh, she's a friend of mine. Sometimes you can't feel your fingers. Maddie? Maddie? I was in the kitchen. I wasn't cooking. You were art girl. This is exactly the kind of thing I was talking about. I mean, having two kitchens is actually really cool. Oh, you hit a gold mine. I just can't see you being happy locked away in some hotel. Yeah, she's trying to trap me here. - Are you kidding? - I meant Cal. I think it would be amazing to take this place over. I mean, it's kind of the perfect town. If there was a train. Why isn't there a train? Aah! Maddie? Oh! Ruthie! She isn't there. Ruthie! - Fran, what is it? - I couldn't find you guys. I-I started seeing things. Oh, my God, what happened to your leg? How did you do that? - I can't be alone. Sit down for a second. Let's get this elevated. Just get your leg up. You're okay. You were having a nightmare. We shouldn't have told you all those stories. We can... Yeah, we can call you an Uber so you can go back home. There's two trains that go back to the city every day. Ohh. I feel so embarrassed. It's okay. It's okay. I totally thought I saw something. I, like, freaked out. How much did you take last night? Maybe I shouldn't have taken that extra Dilaudid. So she's on drugs? Ruthie. It's a patch. It's just a patch. Biopsies hurt. Sorry. - You want to see the scar? - No. It's just under my rib. Yeah, I don't want to see it. Do you guys like paella? My favorite. Come on. Thank you for being so nice to me. Mom, no more texts, okay? I... Just call me. Look, you know, this is most likely the last weekend that we're gonna be here. I'm meeting those buyers tomorrow that you insisted I meet, so... Um, anyway, uh, yeah, just call me back. I love you too. See something? Oh, God. You've got to relax. - Huh. I just wanted to ask you about last night. Last night was nothing. Oh, well, we both know that's not true, but... I wasn't talking about us. There is no us. I need you to stay the fuck away from me. I tried your mask on. What? No. Please don't go in my room. It's okay. I have trouble sleeping too. Found 'em! What's wrong? I was just asking Ruthie if someone died here, like a little girl, 9 or 10. Something with her hands. Sounds kind of like what happened to you. - No. No. - Huh? Yeah. When she was a little girl. Why are you always telling this story? Her mom dropped her off here without checking. She was always dropping her off somewhere with someone. But Nana wasn't here. Hotel was totally empty. Middle of winter. She had to spend three days alone. No food, no electricity. She almost lost three fingers to frostbite. I don't know why you even talk to your mom. Then you obviously don't understand a daughter's devotion to her mother. What I do understand is that Ruthie hadn't seen her mom for seven years, up until three months ago, when she randomly showed up for the will. You've just been acting weird ever since. Like how? Yeah, like how? Like open-minded. I thought you liked that. Yeah. You're right. I guess I do. Oh, my God. Oh, my God! How's your leg?

About the cut getting worse. Her visions. All of it. Come on. Why... Why would she do that? Remember that thing she said about her brother? When she told you she didn't have any family. Also, I didn't see a scar on her belly. Did you? He's probably lying about the cancer scare too. Like, why, why, why would she do that? Why would she lie about something like that? For attention.

But I can't believe we left her at that creepy station. I mean, she could barely walk. - Or could she? - Stop. We did try to take her to the hospital. - Yeah, she refused! - True. - Aah! - Oh! I hate it when you do those freaky things. Why do you always do those freaky things? Yes. And she ripped my coat. I love you guys. I miss you! Why are you still with her?

Is this you feeling guilty and imagining things? - No. - Okay, stop. You probably just saw us running around, okay? We were out there goofing off. - Out there? - Yeah, out... out there. Kitchen, everywhere. Oh, my God. I can't stand this. I'd have thought you'd have learned how to live with your guilt by now. What is that supposed to mean? What is wrong with you? Why are you trying to ruin the weekend? Me? I'm not fucking trying to ruin the fucking weekend. It's Maddie. They're... They're just fucking upset that you left them for me. Cal, where are you going?

She did one of her tricks again. - Is she here? - Did you do that? No. What... Are you kidding? I was on the other side of the hotel. I'm just done with this. I just want to go, and I want to get away from here. She is a murderer. She killed her real estate partner. All over the fucking Internet. It's dead. Ruthie, your phone's dead. Ah... Well, it must have just died. Cal, Maddie... Maddie. I would never do that to you. You have to believe me. She is fucking here, and she is dangerous. Tell me what you want to do. Can... Can you...

I told you over and over again. I told you I don't want to come here! I can't fucking do this right now. Fucking car... the car rerouted. Can we talk about this later? 'Cause I can't... I can't do it. This is insane. Guys, come on. - Let's go. - This is insane. - Now. Let's go. Cal. There's always been something wrong with you. Let's go. - Open the fucking door!

There's a car coming. Cal?! Fuck. Yeah. That makes sense. Mm-hmm. I understand. Okay. Well, mm-hmm. Ye... well, you just let me know. Okay. Ms. Auerbach? You just let me know. Bye-bye. Sorry about that. Hello, Ruthie Nodd. You're the woman from those videos. How are you here? How did... did you get in? That's a lot of questions. I'm with your team. I'm a consultant. Oh. Oh! Right. Yeah. I'm so so... I-I forgot. I... I can't believe that you're here. I didn't realize that you were in the area. Well, I'm not. Not really. I came up from the city. Are you okay? Yeah, it's just... Yeah. There... There's a dangerous woman in this hotel, and we need... We need to get out of here. Sorry. I'm sorry. I must... I must sound really crazy. No. You actually just sound nervous. Like someone who isn't ready to make a big decision. Like selling their grandma's hotel. Hmm. Maybe. Yeah. I... I don't know. Do you want to talk about it? And I kind of messed things up with my girlfriend. I do bad things sometimes. Well, who doesn't? Now, do you think you might be imagining things? I thought I saw someone in the elevator, and no one was really there. Well, there you go. Oh, they're here. Oh, there you are. Ah, your lawyer already looked it over. Or at least, rather, your mother's lawyer. I'm sorry I'm late. Your mother filled out most of the paperwork right after the funeral, as you know. But as the sole proprietor and heir, really need you to seal the deal. We've already done our back-and-forths on this price. I know this place used to be the Four Seasons of the '80s, but times have changed. You're not the only indoor pool in the neighborhood, if you get what I mean. So this is a pretty fair dollar sign. I'm not sure I want to sell. You're kidding me. Then what are you doing here? Why did you insist on me setting up a Saturday visit? You were adamant before, and so was your mother. Sorry. Sorry? Hmm. You both begged me to push this thing through. I'm afraid I'm a little bit baffled. Like, really baffled. Gentlemen. She said that she doesn't know if she wants to sell. I'm sorry. I have changed my mind. I think. My girlfriend has been taking these hospitality classes and, you know, we might get married, and... This offer is not gonna stand forever. It isn't easy to move these kinds of properties. You might want to give your mom a call. Are you okay? You look like you could use a hug. Can you ask for it? Can I have a hug? Your hair smells just like my mom's. If I were your mom, I would never leave you alone. Things happen to little girls who are left alone. I know. I should go. My car is probably here. Of course. I can walk you out. The doors have been acting up. Oh, no, no, no. No. What you need to do is find that girlfriend of yours and work things out. You're probably right. It was really so amazing to meet you. Just remember, you know what's best. Cal? Cal? Cal? Got great news. We're gonna keep the hotel. Cal? Guys, you don't have to be afraid of me. Cal! Cal, Cal, no. No, Cal. No. Cal, no. No. Oh, my God! No, no! It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. Shh. No, no. I called the police. - Did you do that?! They're on their way. We need to get out of here. Is he dead? Ruthie, what are you doing? - I'm just getting his keys. Ruthie, what is going on? Maddie. Maddie, stop! Stop! What are you doing? Fucking maniac! - Stop! What are you doing?! - Fuck is wrong with you?! - Stop! What are you doing?! - Get the fuck out of here! You guys! - Stop it! Fuck out of here! Guys, will you fucking listen to me?! Stop! Fucking listen! - I don't think I can do it. - Do it! Now! Do it now! I am so sorry! Are you fucking insane?! She's a fucking murderer in here! - I can't do this. - You fucking traitors! No! - In there. - You guys, fucking listen! The police are coming! The police are coming! No, guys! No, you can't do this. You can't do this. Fran is out there! Fran's not here. It's you. No! No, it is not. And you know that! Hang on. We'll wait for the police to get here. It's Fran! What is wrong with you? Cal, no, I promise that I w-won't make any m-more mistakes. I promise. I'm gonna... I'm gonna keep the hotel for... for... for us. Cal. I can't be locked in here, not... Please open the door! Open the door! Cal! Can I have a hug? Ruthie? I came back for you. No. What did you do? What did you do? Where's Cal? Cal? Cal?! No. Did you kill them? No. - Cal? - No, no. - Cal?! - No, Ruthie. No. Stop. I came back for you. Can we go? Yes. Cal, what did you do? No, of course not. I just came back for you. I would have never let you come here. What? What is it, Ruthie? I don't know what's going on. I just want to go home. Ruthie! Ruthie, please. Please. Please. Just come with me. Come. Okay, okay. Are you okay? Are you okay? Okay. I am so sorry. I am so sorry. Okay. All right, we... your phone. Let me just get your... Um, is... This isn't your... Why do you have your mom's phone? Oh, yeah. Here. Why do you have your mom's phone? I don't want to talk about it right now. Huh. Oh. I told you I didn't want to come here.
