You're gonna get in that closet and you're not gonna say another word this evening. - I'm not gonna go there... - Shut up, you understand? - I'm not gonna go in that closet. - [Boy] I ain't goin' in that closet. - You're not gonna say another word this evening!

Joni, what's wrong? - Know what's wrong. - Can't we just forget about it for the next few days and have some fun? - Chuck, spending a few days up here isn't gonna make me feel any different. So, we have fun. It's not gonna change anything. - Well, what do you want me to do? I just want you to have a good time. (tapping) - You know what I want you to do. - I know, listen, so what if it doesn't solve anything. Can't we just have some fun? - Fun?

I know what I want. - Well, I know what I want, too, but I still need time to think. Now, come on, promise me you're gonna have a good time. I mean it or I'm gonna give you country noogies.

We planned it for two years and now you say you don't know if you want me anymore? - Joni, I still want you. That's not what I meant. - Well, what do you mean? We've been together all this time, make plans to get married, then you say you're not sure it's what you want. - I'm not sure. - Then you can't be sure you want me. - I still want ya. That hasn't changed. I'm just not sure if I want to get married. - But you asked me, remember? - Yeah, I know. - What's wrong? Is that you don't want to be with me or you're free to fool around or what? - Joni, I don't want anybody but you. I'm just, I don't know, I'm just all messed up. - So am I. - I'm sorry. - I love you. - I love you, too. You do know that? - Yeah. - Then hang in there with me, will ya? Come on.

(screaming) (whooping) (cheering) - Son of a bitch, little mustard? - Okay, you like mustard. - [Jim] Yeah, what is this? - You like mustard. (cheering) (whooping) - Hold it, hold it! Hold it, hold it! Everybody hold it! Right there. (chuckling) - [John] You started this, you jag off.

He poured mustard all over my head. I could have killed him right there. - That's nothing. John does things like that and worse, all day long. - I don't know about those guys sometimes. - Yeah, well I do. I think they're all crazy if you ask me. Every last one of them. - I guess that's what makes 'em fun, though, but what this says about us I don't know. - You got that right. - I guess being a little crazy's okay, but John carries it a bit too far. - Yeah, sure wish I could say Jim did. - [Joni] What? - Oh, I don't know. Seems like my whole life I've been fightin' guys off, and now I find one that I really dig and, oh, I don't know, I can't seem to get to second base with him, you know? - Wish I could say the same about John. I could use a break. (chuckling) - Really? (mumbling) - I have been gettin' all that I can handle. - Eh, sure it's good. - Yeah, right, John. Sure looks like she can't wait for more. - Who said Mary? - Ooh. - I have been gettin' mine on the side. - Oh, we know what side you been gettin' on, too, but uh... - You don't have to tell everybody Joe. We know you're a jag off. (mumbling) - [Carol] Well, at least you got somebody. - True, but he never stops joking around. Not even in bed. - Yeah? - Sounds like fun to me. - Uh no, not going to bed with a guy wearing a mask. (chuckling) - A mask? Then how do you kiss him, girl? - He doesn't wear it on his face. (screaming) (talking over each other) - That one up there ain't doin' me a whole hell of a lot of good. I been wearing my palm down to nothin'. (laughing) - You got no hair on your hands, huh? - [Jim] Eh, it's a mess. Twinkie! - [John] Jesus Christ. - Man, I gotta tell you. I was on the freeway the other night, it was serious business... - Yeah, sure. - And I looked at this girl. She came drivin' up in a Porsche. (mumbling) (whooping) - Yeah, right. - I got a woody. No, I didn't get a woody. (talking over each other) - [John] American breasts? - Breasts and everything. I got a throbber, man. (talking over each other) I pulled my sandal out, there wasn't nothin' else, I couldn't help it, I had it up on the seat and I just... (tapping) - Listen to this guy. (talking over each other) - No, I'm serious. No, it felt good, too. - I bet you were shot for the rest of the week. (laughing) (talking over each other) - What is, what is this? - Tell you what. See this shit? Looks like Mary in the morning. - I had a date like this once. - Hey, hey, I'm gonna slap you silly. - [Joe] Oh, God. - I know you wanna try thirds. (whooping) - [Chuck] What the, what the... - Man. I definitely love this shit. You guys take care. - Get outta town! - Twinkie! - I hope the water works. - Hey, hey, hey. Where you goin', man. We gotta clean up our mess. - What do you mean where am I going? I'm gonna take a shower. - We gotta clean up our mess. - All right, let's go take care of it. What are you doin'? - [Joe] Clean up. (faint mellow music) (footsteps thudding) - Well, I've had enough of this, ladies. I'm gettin' in the shower. - Save some hot water. Ask. (tense music) (water rushing) (music crescendos) (screaming) - Boo! - [Carol] Boo? Oh! - I couldn't think of anything else to say! - [Carol] You creep! - That's all I said!

I'm talkin' about a seance. - [Joni] Hey, that sounds neat. - [Jim] Hey, right. A what? - A seance, you know. Talkin' to ghosts and goblins. Raisin' the dead, stuff like that. - All right, let's do it. - [John] That stuff's all a bunch of crap. - [Joni] So are you, but who's complaining? Scared, John? - [John] Are you nuts? - [Chuck] Is that it, John, scared? - What the hell is this? Pick on John day? - [Joe] Hey, you ain't foolin' no one. Your face is turnin' red! - Get outta here! - John, I think your lip's startin' to disappear. (laughing) (mumbling) That's okay, if you're scared, we can wait for Mary to take you upstairs and tell you a bedtime story. - Hey, you want to hold a scene, go ahead, hold a scene. - [Mary] It's a seance, stupid. - What? - It's a seance. A seance. - That's what I said. A scene. - Some of you have probably already heard what I'm about to tell you. And some of you haven't, so I'll start at the beginning. It happened 10 years ago this month. Seems a woman from the valley ran away from her husband, she came here to meet her lover. She brought her eight year old son. - Not gonna tell you again, you little brat. - [Boy] Not goin' in that closet. - Gonna get in that closet. - Not gettin' in that closet. - Shut up! - Not goin' in that closet! - You're not gonna ruin another evening for me. - Not goin' in that closet. - You're gonna go in that closet and you're not gonna say a word. - [Boy] I ain't goin' in that closet. - [Mother] Don't say another word this evening! (thudding) (tense music) - They had planned to spend a few days up here before moving on, starting a new life for themselves. (mellow jazzy music) - So what do you think? Sexy enough for ya? - What do I think? Damn. You look great. - [Mother] I know. - [Lover] Where's the kid? - Don't worry about the kid. Took care of that little bastard. He won't be bothering us again tonight. - That's just what I wanted to hear. - [Chuck] But they never moved on. For them, there was no new life. - [Mother] Whatever we want. - For them, there was no life at all. (moaning) They left here in bags. They were killed that night. Brutally murdered, right here in this house. Right here in this room. (tense music) Their bodies were found a few days later by a couple of hikers. It wasn't pretty. Make no mistake, there was very little left of them. Their bodies had been crushed, pounded to a pulp. The bones had been pounded over and over again by a madman with a sledgehammer until all that was left was a bloody heap of mangled flesh and shattered bones. There was barely enough of their faces left to match some teeth with their dental records. They never found the boy. Some think he just flipped out and ran off, maybe trying to find help in the forest. If so, he probably died. Police say he was probably taken off by the killer. In either case, most believe him to be dead. That is, except for some people around here. Folks in this part of the county say he's still out there, in the night. Just watching. Waiting. Waiting for his mother's killer to return. Waiting to take his revenge. The killer was never caught. The prime suspect was of course, the woman's husband. There was no charges brought against him. No one knows who did it. No one. He just might come back. (tense music) Tonight. Tonight, we're gonna find out who it was. We're gonna call upon those spirits and find out who or what killed them. Everybody ready? Ready. Spirits, I call upon you. Summon those spirits of those killed in this house so long ago and bring them on to me. Rise, spirits. Rise, awaken on this night of vengeance and walk among the living. Rise and make yourself known to us here tonight. I command you to rise! (tense music) Rise from your eternal sleep. Rise, obey my command! I command you to rise. Give us a sign. - Shit, nothing's gonna happen. (tense music) (growling) What the hell? - They're here now. Speak to us, spirits of the night. Speak to us and let us know the truth of that bloodstained night. I command you to speak. - [Man] How dare you command me? - [John] Holy shit. - Quiet, be quiet. (tense music) We wish only to learn the truth of how you were killed. - [Man] Truth? What truth? We were murdered in cold blood by a raving maniac. - Who did it? - [Man] I can reveal this to only one. (tense music) - [Chuck] Who? - [Man] John. - Me? - [Man] Stand before me. Stand before me now. I want you. - Or what? - [Man] We want to drink your blood. - Bullshit. (tense music) - I think we may have lost contact. - [John] Yeah, well that suits this boy just fine. I say we put an end to this shit right now. - [Man] No! - What the hell is that? - [Mary] Jesus. I vote with John. Let's stop all this now. (tense music) - [Jim] Oh, it's good stuff, huh? - [Chuck] Good? This shit'll kill ya. (mumbling) (growling) (laughing) - If you're trying to turn me on, it's not working. - Yeah? That ghost stuff really had you going, didn't it, Tootsie? - Me? - Yeah, you. - You were the one who nearly wet your pants. - Bull! I was just playin' along. - Playin' along, huh? This guy. - Yeah, that's right, ass breath. - Oh, this is white! I've never seen anyone so scared. Another minute of that you would have ran down the mountain screaming for mommy. - Hey! (laughing) I'm not talking to you. Enough's enough, now, knock it off. - Woo hoo, big bad John shakin' in his boots. - Stop it, Jimmy. (whooping) I said, I'm not gonna tell ya again, now knock it off right now! - Anything you say, sweet pants. - Come on you guys, knock it off. What the hell you doin'? It was all a joke. (mumbling) It was a gag. Me and Joey set the whole thing up. - Yeah, well you scared the hell out of us. - Wasn't it fun? - [Jim] Hey, real fun. - I owe ya for this one, buddy. - [Jim] I think we all in it for this one, buddy. - Hey, hey, come on, knock it off. No, come on, you guys. (mumbling) (cheering) Anybody got a bar of soap? (tense music) Three, four words, four words. (all chattering) Sounds like dirty ears. - Cradle, cradle. (talking over each other) - [Chuck] What are you doin'? Come on, get outta here. What, are you nuts? (talking over each other) - Look at this. - [Chuck] I think I'm gonna have to clean his ears out, John. Two boys, two girls and it's an old pro. (mumbling) - I'm real excited about it. - [Mary] To the moon, yeah, right! - Great. - Oh, I got it. - Like when? (others mumbling) - Let's go upstairs. - No, not now. - Come on. We could just talk. You won't have to do anything. - Do anything? Talk about what? - I don't know, you and I, anything. - We're fine, really. - Okay. All right. You don't wanna go upstairs with me, I'll just take off my top right down here in front of everyone and embarrass you. - Go ahead. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Yeah, you don't care? - Nah. - Really? Okay. - Okay, okay. Come on, let's go. (laughing) (chattering) - [Carol] Jimmy. (mumbling) - Now where did he go? - Probably cooking up another scheme with Joey. - Huh, if they have any sense, they'll peek in on Jimmy and Carol. - He doesn't have to do that for his thrills. I see to that. Is that how you get yours? - How else? - You just wait. - I been waitin' two years. (tense music) - [Carol] Why have you been acting so funny? - What do you mean? I haven't been acting funny. - [Carol] You haven't been acting funny? - No. - Well, all I know is I think that you've been treating me like I haven't even been here for the last couple days. Look it. I even brought us a surprise. (clattering) Come on, sweetheart. What's the matter? - Nothin'. Nothing's the matter. - It's obvious something's the matter. You're shaking like a leaf. - Nothing's wrong. Really. - You never have, have you? - Don't be silly. Of course I have. (tense music) (gasping) - [Chuck] Jesus, you scared the hell out of me! (mumbling) - You scared me, too. - What are you doin' here? - Just bite my head off. I was lookin' for you, what else? - [Chuck] I'm sorry. - Chuck, what's the matter? What's that on your hand? - It's blood. - What? - There's a lot of it on the floor. I think it's Joey's. - What's the joke this time, Chuck? - This is no joke. I came in here to find Joey and there's a lot of blood on the floor. - That's it? You can do better than that. Joey could be anywhere in this old house. What makes you think he's not playin' a joke on you this time? - Joni, this is real blood. I don't know how or why, but I think Joey's been hurt. - Okay, let's go tell the others. - No, not yet. I wanna look for him, first. I guess I could be wrong. I don't wanna say anything without being sure. - [Joni] You're really serious. - Very. (tense music) (screaming) (tense music) (weeping) - Chuck. Chuck. - Joni, what is it? Oh, shit. Listen to me, Joni. You have to go upstairs, get Jimmy and Carol. Can you do that for me? Don't tell 'em anything, just bring 'em down here but don't tell 'em anything. Can you do that? Can you? Okay, go. (tense music) - [John] What's wrong, man? - We got big trouble. I don't know how to tell you this. (tense music) (screaming) (tense music) - Joni, Joni! What the hell's goin' on here? (wailing) Man, check it out. (screaming) Joni, it's okay. Joni, jeez. Go on downstairs. Yell if you find anything. - You'll be the first to know. - [Chuck] What's goin' on? - My ass will go flyin' through the first window I can find. (tense music) Damn. Jesus. Jesus Christ. (tense music) Both dead. - Where'd you get that? - In the room. Some crazy bastard used it to tear 'em to pieces. And I want his ass! - Yeah, I know. I want him, too, but we gotta figure out what the hell's goin' on or calm down and figure out what we're gonna do about it. - Calm down? What the hell you talkin' about? We got some crazy bastard runnin' around here mowing our friends to pieces and you want me to calm down? - Look, John. I don't know about you, man, but I wanna come down off this mountain alive, not carried in a bag. We lose our cool now, we're gone. - He's right, John. - I'm not talkin' to you. Just shut it. - You go to hell. We're talkin' about my life, too. - The only way any of us is gonna get out of here alive is to kill this bastard. We've gotta search this house from top to bottom, find him and tear his damn head off. - That's stupid. How in the hell are we going... - I told you to shut it. - Hold it. Hold it right there. This isn't gonna solve a damn thing. - Oh, you're gonna solve it all, right? - Just listen. I know you want this asshole, man, so do I, but how? If we go after him together, all he gotta do is stay one step ahead of us, right? - Yeah, so? - If we split up, chances are he's gonna get us one at a time and even if we find him, do you think the girls could handle that? I mean, Joni's practically in a state of shock and Mary's not far from it, either. Think about it, John, just think about it. - Okay, I'm listening. - Did you see anything? Any kind of clue? - Nothing. - Okay, this is it. I say we stay right here in this room until first light. That can't be what, maybe three, four hours from now? First daybreak we hike down off this mountain to the nearest town, what do you say? - [Joni] No. - What? - [Mary] Easy, Joni. - Joni, come on. - [Mary] Easy. - [Chuck] Joni, what's wrong, baby? (weeping) - Come on, we have to. You have to trust me, okay? (smacking) Come on, come on, Joni. - I won't stay here, no! - Joni, Joni, Joni, Joni! Listen to me. Listen to me, listen to me. We've got to stay here. We've got to stay here, come on. We gotta stay here, baby. (Joni weeping) We have to stay here. Come on, trust me. Okay, baby, come on. Come on, we gotta stay here. (weeping) - There's something bothering me, Chuck. - What? - I mean, what makes a difference if we wait 'til morning to hike outta here? Just because it's daybreak doesn't mean we're gonna be safe. - Well, at least we'll be able to see what in the hell we're fighting. - And you think we're gonna be able to hike 50 miles in one day. I mean, spend another night out there. - At least we'll be a damn good ways away from this place. - Oh yeah. Okay, I'll tell ya what. We'll do it your way, but if anything else happens, we hunt this sucker down and tear his head off. - Damn right, we do. (tense beat music) (footsteps clacking) (clattering) - They left here in bags. They were killed that night, brutally murdered right here in this house, right here in this room. (tense music) (stairs creaking) Make no mistake, there was very little left of them. Their bodies had been crushed, pounded to a pulp. Their bones had been pounded over and over again by a madman with a sledgehammer, until all that was left was a bloody heap of mangled flesh and shattered bones. (tense music) They never found the boy. Some think he just flipped out and ran off, maybe trying to find help in the forest. If so, he probably died. The police think the killer took the boy. In either case, most believe him to be dead. - Hey, hey wait. Hey, kid, come on kid, open the door. (knocking) Come on, open the door. Hey kid. (knocking) Open it. (coughing) (tense music) (door creaking) (tense music) It's the kid. It's the goddamn kid. (tense music) (footsteps clunking) (groaning) - John. John. (groaning) (gasping) John. John.
