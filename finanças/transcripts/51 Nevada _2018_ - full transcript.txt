Gina? - It's following! - All right, take it easy! Tell me what's going on. Get in the car. Holy shit! Wow, you lasted a whole 10 minutes into the movie this time. That's a new record. It's my one and only super power. All right, let's get you upstairs, you old man. Sexy time? You're too tired. We'll see about that. Ah! Okay. Okay, okay. I dunno how you put it to your face. Aww. Shit in your beard. You said you want me to shave my face? No, you can't shave. Why not? 'Cause I have short hair, you have the rest of the hair. You're the girl, I'm the guy. - You do not look like a boy. - I do. Maybe, like, you know, a really effeminate Peter Pan, but not a boy. Do you want to see Master Blaster 2000 next week? - Nobody wants to see Master... - Please, please. - Yes, they do. - No. In Amherst, New York. What's in it for me? National attention because Dr. Clukian was the gynecologist who also... I think you know what's in it for you. He was killed at the kitchen of his own own home by a high powered rifle shotgun some distance away. Comin' in hot. Oh. - Baby? - Yeah? Let's get married again. - No! - Why? No. Don't you remember how expensive that was? Well, then let's just go to Vegas. Are you serious? Mm-hmm. - Okay! - Mm-hmm. I love you. I love you, too. Forever. Forever and more. Ugh, is this broken? Baby, I'm gonna get a glass of water. Carina! Hey, hey, what happened? What happened? Carina! You're okay. You're okay. Carina, tell me what happened. Hey, it's okay, Carina. It's okay. I am. Okay? It's my job. Yes. Mm-hmm. Okay, love you, too. Trouble at home? It's all good. What's goin' on here? I'm not sure. This young couple called in a double suicide bit. What do you mean you don't know? I'm sorry. This is a federal matter now. Who're you? Call this number, he'll explain the situation. Look, wait a second... Just call the number. We've also contacted your superior to explain the matter. Yeah, so there's that. In all your years, have anything like this ever happened? Hello? Yup, I'm comin'. Sorry for the early morning wake up call. Is it a good time to talk? Carina. Hey. Carina, hey. There's somebody here that wants to talk to you. Carina, we gotta talk about last night, all right? There's someone here's gonna ask you a couple questions. All right? Okay. All right, this is Detective... Detective Anthony Barker. Your husband John was kind enough to let me in to ask you all some questions regarding last night's incident. Uh, that is if you're feeling up to it. Carina, was it? Okay, uh, Carina, John told me that you was the only witness for last night's incident. Can you explain what you saw? Um, pain? Pain. I'm sure it was painful, but... There were two of them. There was one laying on the ground dead, and, um, and the other one looking at me. Um, that's fine, if I need anything, I'll be in touch. Hey, can I ask you somethin'? Uh, sure, what about? If you can give me any information, like names, motives. Sorry. Look, my wife, she's freaked out. I gotta tell her somethin'. I'm sorry, I can't. To be honest, to be honest, I don't know what happened last night. Okay? But I promise you, as soon as I find out anything, I'll let you know. What do you even mean... I'm sorry to bother you, sir. Are you Mr. John Maxi? Yeah, I'm John Maxi. Is Mrs. Maxi home? Uh, you know, no, she's not, so, um, uh, excuse me? What the shit? Yeah, the wife got me out on the couch. I will, but right after I'm done with this case. Look, something's really not right that's goin' on here. Isn't this the reason we became cops? You're one of the good ones, Anthony. Anyway, I found a similar case from a few years back. This poor guy claims he saw a man turn into a lizard person. So now what? Yeah, the crazy bastard moved to Nevada and has been living just outside Area 51 ever since. He's got a website, Tom the Conspiracy Theorist. Sending you a link now. All right, thanks, man, I appreciate it. Come on. What? It's the Master Blaster thing. I thought you loved that. What's that? Role play sex? Excuse me. Can you guys tell me more about your tours? Hi, I'm Isabelle, this is my boyfriend Desmond. What the heck, Isabelle? Oh, hey, guys. I'm Desmond, what can I do for ya? Um, it says you guys are conspiracy theorists. Wait, have you guys actually traveled to all these places? Most of them. We're hardcore enthusiasts trying to find out the answers to what the government doesn't want us to know about. Wait, do you mean like ghosts and things like that? You mean spirits? Yes, yes, of course. So you guys, like, actually seen anything? We've been to some pretty terrifying places, but personally, I haven't seen anything. Well, where are you going next? Well, we're getting a small group together to camp out at Area 51 at the end of the month. You guys should totally come with us. And bring your friends. That sounds epic. Awesome! Just sign up right here, and we'll give you a couple in a couple of weeks when we have everything set up. Awesome, sounds good. All right, all right, yay. Camping, aliens. Master Blaster 2, come on. Are you sure you wanna do this? Yeah! Come on, it'll be fun. Really, like, I been trying to be cool, like, the last couple months, I know you're coping with a lot since that night, but this is just a little much. Aw, are you scared we'll actually find something? I mean, a jail cell? Oh my God, John, you know me better than that. I mean, do I? Because over the last couple months, I know you've just been coping with so much that you've just been researching nonstop on the internet. All these conspiracy theories, and like all this stuff. Listen, I swear I'm fine. Let's just do this one last thing, and then it's over, okay? I promise. All right. - I love you. - I love you. Hey! It's me, Brother B. And I've come with a very special message for you today, and it's about aliens, and how they are among us, and how the government is covering them up. And based on the substantial evidence that... Hey, you ready yet? Local authorities, and these might know - it is true. - Hello, Carina. You in there? There is no Carina, only Zuul. All right, well, as long as you pay rent, I don't care. No, come on! There's only five more minutes! Aren't you gonna get enough of that stuff this weekend? What the hell? Hey, you know we got a front door, right? Oh, I'm sorry, man. I shoulda called first. Are you goin' somewhere? Yeah, uh, I'm actually taking the wife up to Area 51. Mm. That's your idea of a romantic getaway? Yeah, I mean, no, but since that night, she's Just been like researching government conspiracies, and, you know. What you think? Think about what? Government conspiracies, ghosts, aliens. No, no. It's, uh, it's not my thing. Yeah, so, uh, I gotta get goin'. Uh, not to hold you up, but if you don't mind, I'd like to hang back for a couple of minutes just to see if I find anything. Knock yourself out, man. All right. Oh yeah, and if you find my wedding ring back there, - can you let me know? - Finders keepers. It's the bottom of the eighth inning, and so far it's been... Should we report him? What? No. It's just creepy, though. I don't think he meant anything by it. I mean, if anything, you know, realistically, I think he's the only one that actually gives a shit, so... Okay. Change of subject, let's listen to some creepy stories. Ahh, no can do. I'm drivin', so we'll listen to whatever King John wants to listen to. Whoa, King John? Am I supposed to call you that now? Uh-huh, yup. That's King John, master of the bedroom to you. All right, well, I guess there's some truth to that. Forever? Forever and more. Pitcher throws the fastball. It's a hard hit! Ground to third, over to second in time... What're you still doin' here? Oh, Chief, I was just finishing up. Something on your mind? Uh, no, no. I'm fine. When're you gonna learn to trust me, Anthony? You're still working the Maxi case. Look, Chief... I know you have a hard time letting things go, but I'm gonna look the other way on this one. But come Monday, I want you to forget about it. Blood test results are in. Monday. Are you sure those are the lab results? Did you take multiple samples? No, no, it's fine, it's okay. Look, I gotta, I can't have my wife catching me right now working this late. Okay? All right, I'll talk to you Monday. All right. Honey, I'm home! Baby? Jessica. Honey? Baby. Detective Anthony Barker. Oh, Tom? I'll get on right now, okay? Hello, my friend. How are things this evening? Not so good, man. What's with the long face? I messed up, man, tonight, uh, I was supposed to be with Jessica for our anniversary. Oh, man, did you forget your own anniversary? I know, man, yeah. Hey, I told you to take it easy, my friend. Hell, your partner and your boss told you the same thing. I know, look, but I'm gonna fix everything. I'm gonna set everything right, I'm gonna get, have Jessica fall back in love with me, but as soon as I finish this case. Oh, speaking of which, I was reading up on the lizard people living underground. Actually, I was wondering if you could tell me more about the Men in Black. The Men in Black. Yeah, I, I think I met them. On the case you're workin' on? Yeah. Tom, I'm telling you, something's really not right that's going on. Really sketchy. I don't know, it's like, Ms. Maxi, right? She says she saw two bodies that night. - And? - It happened. Yeah, by the time I showed up, there was only one body. No one else tampered with the evidence. I'm telling you, man, it's a government conspiracy. That's not all. I found some bloody headphones in the backyard, right? Please tell me you ran them for prints. It was the husband. I swear her husband did it. The blood was mine. Dude. That's some M. Night Shama-level twisted shit. I think I'm startin' to lose my mind. I'll see what my guys say about the MIB, but I would lay low, man. You're way in over your head. I dunno. Maybe. Hey, they told us to meet them at that alien-themed restaurant off the 15, right? You know what? Let me check. Yeah, that's the one. Well, I think this is it. Oh, wow. There's the welcoming committee. Be nice. I haven't even said anything yet. - Hi! - Hey. Hey! - How are you? - You made it! I did. Hello, how are you? Good! Hi! - Hey! - Oh! Goin' in for the hug, okay, okay. You remember my boyfriend Desmond? - Yeah. - Glad you all could make it! This is his cousin Logan, he's visiting from Florida. What're you doin' up this way? You know, anything to get away from the parents. Oh, you're still in college? Workin' on my PhD. Logan's gonna be a doctor of microbiology. Very impressive. Thank you. Well, I'm hungry. - Anyone else? - Me, too, yeah. Let's go. Haven't you ever seen cloth in space before? I'm tellin' you, you gotta look at the flag. But I thought the moon had some gravity. Does it not? Yeah, wouldn't that mean there'd be a little atmosphere? AKA wind? Okay, well, what about all the shadows? What shadows? All of the shadows are coming from different directions. Technically, only the sun is giving the light. Huh. Baby, what do you think? Oh, don't ask me, I just build bikes. Come on, what do you say? The moon landing, is it fake or real? Why would it be fake? Because the US government wanted to win the great Space Race with Russia. Okay. I mean, I think that's a dumb reason to fake a moon landing. Yeah, you're not gonna get anything out of him. That's not true. She gets somethin' out of me every night, right? Bah! Hey. I'm gonna hit the head. Which way's the restroom? Around back on your left. Thanks. Sorry about that. Don't be. You shouldn't have to hold back your love for a second. I think it's important to always show affection for the one you care for. So what do you ladies think about the Roswell crash? Don't go, please, stay! - Please, don't go! - Listen, back up! - Don't! - Back up! - Dude! - No, stay, stay! Back up, man! - Calm down! - Stay, stay! Calm down! All right, hey, chill out! - Chill! - Stay. Oh my God, John, what happened? Hey, just some crazy guy back there, all right? - It's nothing. - Where? What, what do you mean? Some old dude just yellin' at me. - What? - Let's go kick his ass! - No, Logan, Logan. - Logan! Logan! Logan! Come on, let's just get out of here! Come on! - All right? - Are you sure you're okay? Yeah, I'm fine, all right. He just spooked me. Let's get in the car, come on. Ever think about time time travel? Yeah, yeah. Like for instance, if you, you got any more stakes over there? Yeah. Like if you could go back in time and kill Hitler, but you knew because of the butterfly effect and everything that if you did, you'd actually be born a woman instead of a man, and, uh, I don't know, like, uh, your sister has some sort of terrible disease... I mean, yeah, no, I think about that all the time. Tent's lookin' good, boys, keep it up! Oh, thanks, Logan. Little help? No, you guys got this stuff figured out more than I do. It's better left in your hands. You guys got it. Hey, Desmond. Yeah. So, uh, what's the deal with your cousin? Oh, he's in a fraternity. Got kicked out of school with the rest of them. He's on academic suspension until they review his case. Whole hazing thing, you know how it goes. What, like the butt stuff? Yeah, like the butt stuff. You know, the kinda stuff you read about. I suspected. Yeah, yeah, so they're all on academic probation pending review. So how's business though, like with the tours and stuff? Things good? Well, you didn't bring anyone, so... Well, it's not my job. So, you know. Yeah, no, we're doin' all right, we're doin' all right. Gone to a lot of really cool places. I think you're gonna love Area 51. I mean, as long as Carina likes it, you know. Come on, get into the spirit. I'm with it, I'm with it, you know. Like, time travel, right? Paradoxes. Quantum Leap. Aliens. Aliens, that's it, that's it. I'm gonna make you a believer yet. - Somethin'. - We'll see. Well, tent looks like shit, so it's probably perfect for Logan. So what made you wanna come to Area 51 with us? I'm sorry, what's that now? I'm sorry, it's just that you and your husband don't seem like our usual clients. Yeah, well, we're all kinda new to this stuff. Oh, yeah? Yeah, um, I mean, I actually don't really talk about it, but some weird things happened to me a few months ago. Yeah? Yeah. I mean, I don't even know how to describe it. There was this man, and, um, he shot himself. Oh my God, that's awful! Why? That's the thing, I don't know. But his face was like... Well, did you call the police? Yeah. But I don't know, they weren't like real police. Weren't real. Okay, to be honest, Isabelle, I think this whole thing is a government coverup. I mean, the cops came, and I just don't think they were real cops. And then these two men dressed in black, they came in, too. It was so weird. Well, did John see any of this? Yeah, John thinks I'm losing my mind. Don't say that. I've seen the way he looks at you, and it's nothing but love. Can you do me a solid? Sure. Can you just not tell John about any of this? My lips are sealed. I want my clients to enjoy their time with us, and there's no need for unnecessary drama. Okay. Speaking of which, would you mind if I grabbed a selfie for the website? Uh, sure thing. What is that? What do you mean? Look, there's something in the background. Oh, no, that's just, like, a plane or something. No, look! It's a UFO, huh? No, I'm sure. Well, shit. Logan, I told you to close up the food before we left, man. It's not my tour, man. Ugh! The fire should get rid of them. Let me see if I can get this started. All right. And voila, we're campin'! Babe, can you grab me another beer? One beer comin' up! Let me see if I can get this started. This really takes me back. Oh, were you in Boy Scouts or something? Ah, I was actually, uh... John was in the marines. Oh! So what was your job? Communications. Well, thank you for your service. Yeah, I mean it wasn't really for me, but I did learn a lot. I'll bet. Well, I wanna know, what do you guys do? Wait, wait, wait, wait, let me guess, let me guess. Something to do with motorcycles, and personal trainer. She's got me pegged. That's close, I'm, well, I'm a graphic designer. Oh, an artist! So you use like Photoshop and things like that? Yeah, I love it. So what about you? Well, I mean, besides hosting these tours, I like to paint and make jewelry, but it's not something, you know, I would call a career. Did you make that bracelet? - Mm. - I love it. Ooh, ooh! I got it! Everyone, look at what I've created! Bow down to the great and powerful Desmond! All right, I want some marshmallows. I've been cravin' since the drive here. I want one! Same. So tell me what you know about Area 51. Oh, yeah, well, so what we read was that Area 51 was created by our government to build and test stealth aircraft and keep it secret from the Russians. So you're saying they just built stealth aircraft to spy on the Russians. Yeah, that, too. Apparently, the base was declassified a few years ago. I believe it was officially declared an aircraft testing facility. That's lame, I want to hear about conspiracy theories, I wanna hear, like, all the scary stuff. They just told you, honey. John, you will not ruin this for me. You guys are so cute. All right, let me think. Desmond, can you think of anything? Desmond! - What's that now? - I'm talking to you. Tell them some theories about Area 51, and get off your phone! We're out here to enjoy the experience! Oh, oh, right. Uh, there are a lot of really, uh, a lot of theories about Area 51, the most popular of which is that aliens crash-landed here, and their bodies were recovered and brought back to the base. That's more like it. Yeah. There's also a theory that there was a deal struck up between the aliens and the humans. What deal? They would give us all of their secrets and enhance our technology in exchange for us harboring them on our planet. Really? Yeah. Some people even think that's why we have smart phones now, and advances in our medical technology. Really any technological advances in the past few years is thanks to them. Yeah, well, that makes sense to me. Yeah, you're just eatin' this up, aren't you? Oh, come on, I just think it would make sense to come up with these theories. I mean, don't get me wrong, I just don't believe it. You're not very spiritual, either, are you, John? Well, I mean, I believe in what I can see. So you believe that when we die we just die. No, no afterlife. I mean, I guess. That's a scary thought. Oh, come on, John, you've gotta believe in something. Ghosts? God? Galactic beings? Tell them. - No. - Come on, please? Oh, this I gotta hear. All right, well, I mean if I had to believe in something, you know, I mean... Yeah. I guess, uh, mermaids, all right? Mermaids, really, are you serious right now? Logan, don't laugh! I mean, mermaids could exist. Yeah, right. All right, I need another beer. No, babe, we're just playing around with you. Jessica? Jessica. Jessica! Tom. Tom, pick up, pick up. Hello? We told you to move on. You son of a bitch. What have you done with him? We're watching you, Mr. Barker. Hey, baby. Hey. Thank you. For what? For putting up with me. I've put you through so much this year, and I promise when we get back, I'm gonna cook you that pumpkin pie, and I'm gonna have so much sex with you. I love pumpkin pie. I should be thankin' you. Why? For marryin' me. Aw. Forever. Forever and more. Knock, knock. You guys coming? Where? We're checking out Area 51, come on. All right, come on, let's get dressed! All right, is this even legal? Yes, it's legal, we're just going to the gate. Okay, but what if we drive past it? We're not gonna drive past it. What if? Babe, stop worrying, okay? We're gonna be fine. The radio's busted. All right, how far is this place? I dunno, maybe like another mile or so? What the hell? Oh my God, baby, just stop complaining! It's not even that far of a drive! Just look, all right? I think that car's following us. Yeah? They're slowing down. Oh. Well, it looks like it. Pfft, look at you. Oh my God, look at you. What? You've been jumpy ever since we got out here. What? No. Aww, you're scared that aliens are gonna get us. All right, we're in the middle of nowhere, all right? And if anything happened to us, I just, I don't know what I'd do, but it's a legitimate concern. All right, we're here. All right, have fun. Oh, you're going down with me. Hey, come on, baby. All right, guys, so this is the east side gate of Area 51. We're staying up at Mount Tikaboo, which is actually the closest... Here we are at Area 51 with my friends. Say hi, everyone! Hey. Closest peek from which you can see the Area 51 site. Pretty cool. Isabelle, can you take a photo of us? Yeah, sure can. Just don't cross that line or those camo dudes will get you. Ah, duly noted. Hey, watch it, watch, watch the line. Look happy. All right. Hey, Carina, can you grab a photo of us? Desmond, get off your phone! How do you even have service out here? Sorry, I was just talkin' about Area 51. Yeah, sure you were. Uh, hey, are those the camo dudes? It looks like it. Come on, man, don't go over there. Isabelle, grab a photo of me crossin' the line. Rebel. Come back, Logan. They're gonna see you. They're not gonna do a damn thing, man. Relax. Come on. Dammit, Logan, they're coming! Ah, shit, all right, guys, we should go. What're they gonna do, kick me out? Come on, let's go! Hey, you see this truck? Yeah. Baby, they're catchin' up. Oh, they're honking. They want us to pull over. That's, oh my God. All right, stop, just stop. All right, babe. - Get outta your car! - They're pullin' them over. - Get outta your car! - What? They're pullin' them over, just... Oh my God, they have guns? - Baby... - Get out! Get out, put your hands on the vehicle! Baby, just stay here. Get over here! - Oh my God. - Now! - Follow him, follow him! - Baby, it's fine. Do we get out? No, no, no, no, baby. Shut the hell up and get your hands up against the car now! What are you doing out here? We're just doing photography. Oh my gosh, Logan is such a freaking idiot. Check that car! It's fine, it's fine. Baby, it's fine. You're not supposed to be out here! What are you guys doin' here? We're just out campin', man. We're just looking for aliens. Looking for aliens. That's it. I need you to get the hell out of here, you hear me? Absolutely, that's fine. Go home! We're good, Smith. Get the hell outta here. Thank you! Shut the fuck up, Logan, jeez. Follow us back. - Oh my gosh. - Get the hell outta here! Oh my God. Holy shit. Fuck, it's fucking scary! It's fine, we're all fine, okay? All right. Let's just get back to the camp site. It's okay, all right? Oh, yeah, you're cool. Just crack open another beer. Relax, they didn't even do shit, like I said they wouldn't. That was so reckless, Logan! Desmond. It's fine, we're all good now. Just try to tone it down a notch, would you? This is my business, it's not a game. All right, man, fine. Whatever, jeez. Relax and have a beer. Yeah, you got another one of those, John? Yeah, no problem, man. Thanks. So how did you and Isabelle meet? Um, let me see, uh... Come on, you can't remember? It was a long time ago. I dunno, I remember it was in high school. Yeah, well, Desmond and I met in high school, and his best friend Kyle introduced us. That's right. Kyle Novak. What an annoying asshole. Why were we friends with him anyway? Don't look at me, he was your best friend. I was just friends with him by default because of Victoria. Oh, yeah. I forgot they dated. That was so long ago. That's so cute. Y'all were high school sweethearts. Yeah, well, what about you two? How'd you guys meet? Ours was slightly less romantic. I don't know what she's talkin' about. It was full of romance and passion. No, um, John got wasted at a bar, and then he hit on me. Yeah, well, when you say it like that. It's true. All right, well, I was on leave, right? It was my buddy's birthday, and we were at a bar, sipping whiskey as one does. And, uh, I saw her, she was standing across the room, and she was the most beautiful woman I'd ever seen. And I knew right then, you know, that she was the one for me. I mean, it was as if time had stood still. You're so cheesy. I mean it! I know, I love you. I love you forever. Forever and more. Oh my God, you guys are adorable. So, uh, Logan, what's your story? You gonna settle down anytime soon? No. Ah, come on, there's gotta be a man? A woman? You're funny, bro. I'm not like that. Besides, I got somethin' good goin' on. Uh, who wants to tell ghost stories? Well, I want Desmond to tell us more about the aliens. What do you wanna know? I've got hundreds of stories. Okay, so you were talking about, uh, the great whites, or... - The Tall Whites. - Yeah. Okay, so apparently, there's a theory that there are five different alien species currently living among us, one of which is the Tall Whites. They're a tall humanoid species that has a Nordic resemblance. So, okay, so what are the other kinds of... Mermaids? No, actually. But there are reptilians. Dude, come on, man. You've heard of the lizard people that live underground? Yeah, I've heard some stories. I've read some stories that say the reptilians control our government and have secret underground cities. Okay, so what's that story about the Denver airport? I've read that there's a secret doomsday bunker under the Denver airport. Is that true? Yes, I believe it is, actually. All right, see, that's cool, all right? I'm gonna look that up when I get home. You should. Okay, so what are the other kinds of aliens? Oh my gosh, it doesn't matter. It's not real! Explain to me again why it's so hard for you to believe that aliens currently live among us. Because. Entertain the idea just for a minute. Why wouldn't aliens currently be living among us, or watching us, or even be hidden in that secret bunker at Area 51? All right. Let's just think about it, all right? Let's think about it in reverse. So you're gonna tell me that we can fly to other planets, travel with all this technology, and we're just gonna land and just, like, say hey? No, all right? We're gonna send satellites first, we're gonna research, we're gonna learn. You know, we gotta make sure it's safe first. And then and only then are we gonna land and meet anyone. Like, it just wouldn't make sense. Yeah, well, what if that's exactly what's happening now? What if they're watching us? Then we'd send satellites. Maybe they have. All right, then somebody with a telescope would have seen something. I mean, maybe they see things all the time. Yeah, people probably do see things and report it, but the media just makes them out to be crazy. Yeah, I mean, if I told you I saw an alien, you would have me committed. Look, if they were out there, I think it'd be obvious. Well, looks like we put these two out. I'm gonna turn in. Y'all have a good night. - Night. - Night. Yeah, I'm gonna go to bed, too. All right. You gonna put the fire out? Yeah, yeah. Thanks, Mom. Are you doin' okay? Yeah. You weren't out there very long. Yeah, I just wanted to look at the stars. You had to take a shit, didn't you? Yeah. I knew it. Dammit. Now I gotta pee. Carina! Carina! Carina! What? What's that sound? Isabelle? What the hell is going on? Were you two just? Oh my God, this is not real. Look, man, it's not... You shut up! Look, man, you wanna fuck... Desmond, you did this to us! - What did I do? - It's your fault! How did I do this? How is this my fault? You've been treating me like shit these past few weeks, never paying any attention to me! You're always on that fucking phone! Oh, so you screw my cousin! - This is your justice? - Hey! Chill out, dude! All right? Chill out! Desmond! Desmond, it's not safe! Should we go after him? I, I, oh my god. All right, Isabelle, Logan! All right, we're goin' after him.
