Here. St. Valentine's Day is today. Go on. Open it. They're Ome-zingly comfortable. another one of your jokes? No. Wait... I'm speechless... We've always had such big dreams. And you give me slippers for St. Valentine's Day. Don't be unfair. I thought you'd like them. Call them "house-shoes", if it makes you feel. What are you doing? Tinkerbell! Alexander, I put lavender-scented sheets. in the yellow room. Good night. Come out. Come out. I know you're there. Do you always rob by hopping through windows? How do I know you're not the robber? Me? Yes, you! What the hell are you doing here? I'm visiting Ti and Maud and you're eating my yogurt. I'm Maud's granddaughter. Fanfan. So you're Fanfan... I'm Alexander. I don't have a key, so I used the window. I'm soaked. It's pouring! It's funny Ti and Maud never introduced us. Maybe they were scared to. Can you help me? But of course, Miss. Why couldn't it? Mammy said you weren't God's gift to women. You're well-informed. She mentioned you again a few months ago. We were discussing men unsure of their virility. I was Maud's example? Take a lucky guess. You saw me behind the curtain? No, I smelled you. Rowing here made me sweat. There was a strong current. Sorry. No, you smell good. I'm a "nose". You make perfumes, like Maud? Not yet. I have to pass my exams next month. I study at school's Maud... at Maud's school! I'm pooped. I'm going to bed. There's just the yellow room. So? There's just one bed in it. We're not wild animals! You're right. There's no problem. We're not animals. Aren't you undressing? Usually I sleep naked. If you insist on wearing something, take mine. They're for man. Thanks. When Ti went Blind, did you really visit him at the hospital blindfolded? Fanfan... I know I'm ridiculous, but... I can't sleep in the same bed as you. Did I scare you? Yes! You're going to sleep on the floor? What scares you most: me or yourself? Goodnight! Grapes? No thanks. Taste... Fanfan. I'm not hungry for anything. Goodnight. Pleasant dreams. Alexander... are you sleeping? I'm trying to. I'm muggy. How about going skinny-dipping? Do I scare you that much? I'm tired. I want to sleep. The sea is freezing. What ever you say. If you change your mind, I'll be on the beach. Mammy... Why didn't you introduce me to Alexander before? What do you do when you see a nice cake? I gobble it up. Watch your waistline. for once. Hello. Sleep well? Yes. Can you help me make the bed? Sure. Tonight, I don't want to repeat last night's mistakes. I agree. I prefer the left side. Do you mind sleeping on the right? Hold on. Last night we had no choice. Today we'll plan ahead. Exactly. So I'll take the left. Let's go. Where to? To my hideout. Fanfan? Where are you? Fanfan... give me that key, don't be silly. When I was little. I came here to relax all alone. Now I want to relax with you. We won't do anything for 10 minutes. That's all... Lie down here. next to me. Give me that key. What do you think? That I brought you here to hump you madly? Not at all. I just want to feel comfy...intimate. It's your choice. I'm not forcing you. Okay. But just 5 minutes. Aren't we comfy? Can you hear the birds? Where is the key? Listen to the birds. Enough. Let's go. I'll be back by 10. You're not eating here? I have 1...2...3... ninners tonight. I can't say no! Ti, is today the 8th? Yes. Shit! I'm having lunch tomorrow with Laures's parents. I completely forgot about it. I have to leave now. I'll hitch a ride back to Paris. I have a set to finish. No thanks. I quit. Poor Fanfan has no charm at all! And less grace than a cockroach. She's gloomy. As exciting as a meter maid. A retired meter maid. Areal wallflower. Stop. I'm back. Your Lordship. How's tricks, Roger. It's Jacques. Can you bring your cardiology notes to the hospital tomorrow? Tinkerbell! Darling, it's Laure. I'm at my Parent's. For 5 years now, we've stuck it out together. I don't want you to blame me for frustrating your libido. So I'm giving you a call girl. for the night...an Italian. At least it will be purely sexual with her. At this very moment, she is in our room. Naked. She's waiting for you. Go on! Go ahead! You have my blessings. Miss? Is someone there? Si! There's been a misunderstanding. Get dressed. But I am dressed. Be a good girl. Be civilized. Put your clothes back on. Anyway, it's too late now. I've been here three hours. I have to go. Laure? What were you up to? Incredible! After 5 years, you didn't want to cheat on me? Just a little? Were you testing me? Maybe. I was dying for sex. Don't surprises like that titillate you? Can you do up my zipper? Alexander, I'd love to, but I'm in a rush. Thanks. Where are you going? To my parents'. With you. Hello. Greetings, Alexander! Close the door. Damned drafts! They say I'm a hypochondriac, but it is chilly. I feel weak. Don't you? I'm still ticking. That's marriage for you: two pounds a year. Careful. Laure cooks like her mother. Like mother, like daughter. What will you have? A whisky? A martini? A scotch. Have you thought about... Taking over the family trade? Quite honestly, I don't think so. Funeral parlors may seem boring. But they do have their good side. Recessions don't touch us! Like they say, Fortune favors the bold. Thank you, but that's not really my calling. Daddy, leave him alone. The door! I'm feeling low on antibodies these days. Put on your shoes. It's time to eat. Believe me: Nothing succeeds like success. To coin a cliche... Alexander? How are you? Come help me in the kitchen. On the double. Damned women... Like the poet said: Wedlock is a padlock. Women... After you have 30 years of marriage under your belt. you'll say proudly " We made it!" Dinnertime! Come on! Men make houses. women make homes. Don't I seem a little pale? Alexander... so you really love this one? Yes, and I'll make him even more lovable once. we're living together. Tell me, who is this punk... stealing my baby girl? I really don't know. all I know is his name: Alexander Crusoe. A descendant of Robinson. Honest to God! I'm in deep shit. Laure? No. she's fine. You know when you meet a girl... who blows you away... who makes you feel alive? There's something magical, something pixieish... The thrill dies down as soon as you're stupid enough to kss. But something else is born... or can be born...sometimes. Tenderness... I know the refrain. But the charm, the seduction vanishes. And it's gone for good. So? What's the alternative? Love for money? A series of one-night stands? Abstinence? How disgusting! On the way here, I made a decision. I think I've found the solution. To what? The solution! So the thrill won't die. So Fanfan and I will never know. the banality of coupledom. and might we know the solution? I'll court Fanfan forever. without ever letting her know I love her. I'll never kiss her. till the day I die. Are you joking? No! Why should I lay her. if we'll become like every couple nostalgic for the time before their first kiss? Ti, I want my desire to remain perpetual, and Fanfan's too. What's exciting is when desire remains unfulfilled. I only feel alive when I'm crazy for someone. And Laure in all this? I love her. I really do. I'll stick with her come what may. I'll remain faithful... physically. My adventure with Fanfan will escape reality. I'll allow myself every folly. Every single one. What is this? This way, Madame. I forgot the keys. It's a secret passage. You know what I like most here? No. You. Why do I ask all the questions? What should I ask? Your height? Your height? Your bust? I'm slender. If you take me in your arms, you'll see I'm not heavy. My bust measures 36 B... C. C? Thanks. That's all you want to know? Ask me about myself. You hardly know me. You don't know my last name... or that I've got no sense of humor, or that I teach acrobatics to children to pay the rent. You don't know... how much I want to be truly know. how much I want to be wanted. Sorry, it's a cold meal. Appetizer: mashed banana. Then: chocolate pudding, tortilla chips. and vintage lemonade. Everything I loved as a kid! I asked around. who told you? I'm well-informed too. Let's eat before it gets cold. Wait...where is it? The toilet? Upstairs. Which door? The first one. Left or right? Left. I don't want to do a laundry. I want to pee. On the right. Sorry. Lemonade? Where I come from, we answer the phone. There's an answering machine. your father is German? Yes. it's his girlfriend...kissing him goodnight. No, she said she'd call back. I speak German. Where are we? At my father's place. Alexander. You don't have the keys, you don't know where the toilet is, the answering machine speaks a language you don't. Whose apartment is this? Okay. It's not exactly my father's place. It's banker's. Swiss-German. Pretend it's my father's. and you know this banker? No. I wanted to take you someplace worthy of you. I can't afford a fancy restaurant. I'm stupid. I always have to embellish reality. what do we do? Nothing. Nothing? would you tell me... what you are doing here? We're dining, sir. What the...? How did you get in? who are you? I should ask you. You didn't even ring. Lutz, call the police. This is my apartment, Miss. You are eating at my table, on my plates. What's today's date? The 18th. Why? You said you rented up to the 30th. another mistake? You're such a nitwit! I can't trust you at all! I can't trust him at all! But I didn't rent the apartment. Stop your wife, pronto. or I'll play the answering machine. There's a message from... Julia. She seemed ever-so-sweet. loving... affectionate. Charming. Utterly charming. Police? Honeypie... I forgot to tell you. I rented the apartment. Now, we'll have a little nightcap...in Vienna. Vienna? A nightcap in Vienna? Yes. In Austria. But first I have to blindfold you. Blindfold me? Go ahead! I want to share... stupendous memories with you. Here we go! Off to Vienna! Where do you live? Near Chinatown. In a tiny, dark, studio that I hate. I'm upset because I found a great place at Palais Royal. 38 Rue de Valois. A little too expensive. The wall was an enormous mirror. A ballerina rented it before. Oh yeah? Yeah. Where are we? At a small airport. I rented a plane. A plane? You can afford a plane? How much does an intern make? Not much. I took a five-year loan. It beats buying a dishwasher on a installment plan. Come on. Keep the blindfold on. Give me your hand. Let me lead you. Where are we? Bend down. There's a propeller. Put this gown over you. A gown? Yes. So you'll be ready to wait when we touch down. Can I take off the blindfold? Five more seconds. What's going on? Fanfan... We're in Vienna. In 1813! It's just like Vienna, in 1813. Madame, you are truer to my dreams. that the women who inspired them. Your delightful nonchalance belong only to God's most unfettered creatures. My inagination cannot embellish perfection. Herr von Metternich, will Europe soon be rid of that horrid Napoleon? I am weary,princess. Come to the terrace. Far from this tumult. I was badly wounded at Austerlitz. Sir...you dare come here? I forbade you to enter the palace after you doubted Madame de Fanfan's Virtue. She is a mother, but no less a virgin. Just like her famous precedent. You dare unsheathe your sword? Fear not. I am here. Cad! Slimy scribbler! No, Prince. This rogue is known to castrate. Madame de Fanfan's honor is as precious... as my family jewels. Back! Contriver of vile verse! Foul-mouthed villain! Horrid Hell-hound! Flee, flea! if cowards had horns, you'd shame an antelope! Your Lordship. spare your chest his sword, for my virtue is... questionable. Madame! If a thousand soldiers pounced you. Pitilessly. You'd still be a white lily to me. Knave, I'll gorde your ghastly guts. Go on, kill him. Skin him alive! Prince, on guard! Your left, your right! Retreat! Thou are wounded? Alexander. You're really bleeding! Madame, a wench's maidenhood is not laughing. I love this view of Vienna. This terrace bathes in calm. What a delightful breeze. Will you partake in a glass of champagne? With pleasure. Ti is building this set. He gave me the keys. The highlight of the evening. Here. There's a slight problem with this reconstruction. The smells. In 1813. you would have smelled like wild animals. week-old pickled sweat, and decomposed horse manure. But tonight... you smell good. really good. I'm sorry. No one is perfect. To our friendship. A true friendship between a man and a woman in so rare. Fanfan, I really appreciate the sincerity of our relationship. The delightful absence of ambiguity. True complicity. Let's drink to our friendship. May it last forever! It's late. Tomorrow's Monday. I'll drive you back. Drop me off at Paul's place, please. Paul? Yes. Didn't I mention him? No. Let's go. But who's this Paul? Interested? He's a sculptor. We study perfume together. How fascinating. He's doing a nude of me. Actually, I'm relieved. Really. By what? I was afraid things would get ambiguous, that I'd have to refuse your advances. You can't imagine how happy I am. I've always wanted a real friend a simple relationship. Oh... I feel humiliated. I made you a candle-lit dinner. I thought you were with your parents. Is she a blonde or a brunette? Who? The girl who bit your lip. You want the truth? She's a brunette. Nothing happened. Nothing ever will. How can you say that so calmly, the day you decide to marry me. It's the truth. You expect me to accept that? I can't live with you if you lie, if you think I'm a lamebrain. I won't stop you from living, but I need to trust you. Don't yell at me when I'm honest. Nothing will ever happen with her. No, leave me alone! What is this? The guest list. For our wedding? Yes. you didn't waste any time. I had plenty of it tonight! Mom insisted on inviting Auntie Blanche and Uncle Robert. And her mother! Yes her mother! My grandmother! Laure, we always said we'd make no compromises. Uncle Robert would never have forgiven me. But Auntie Blanche? We can't invite Uncle Robert without Auntie Blanche. I don't give a shit about Uncle Robert or Auntie Blanche. And I can't stand your grandmother! We're paying for half of the wedding. We can invite 3 people! I wanted a smaller wedding! That we paid for ourselves! With guests we really want! Alexander, I'm scared. Of what? The brunette you won't touch. You touch me without seeing me anymore. We fight over bullshit. I wish I weren't yours, so you'd want me again. What's happening? It's no one's fault...but time's. Make me a baby. He's playing with my mind. I don't get it. Who does he think he is? He hits on me, dumps me, keeps on talking about what love is! He's convincing himself. I don't give a shit. He pisses me off! Still, he's a far cay from the others. I want to slap him! Make up your mind. I can't. I hate him. but he makes me feel alive. What an ass! What an ass! Why won't he kiss me? Why isn't he normal? If he were, I wouldn't even notice him. Alexander doesn't believe what he says. But he'd like to. Well, I believe it, goddamnit! Maybe I'm naive, but I believe in eternal passion! For life! I'll believe in it for Alexander until he believes it himself! Is he gay? Not at all. He lives with Laure. Laure? You didn't know? I never smelled women's perfume on him. Laure wears men's cologne. He never mentioned her? Never! Who is this girl? Is it serious? They do live together. Asshole! Bastard! Have they been together long? What is she like? You know about girls who wear men's cologne! Think about your exams. Forget Alexander. He'll drive you crazy. I'll expunge all thoughts of him. I'll never see him again. Can you help me take all this upstairs? To your studio? Do you have time for a drink? No, I have to go. Is something wrong? I should go. It's better. What is it now? I'm sick of this! Excuse me, sir, am I that hideous? Miss, I'm 82 years old. And boy, do I regret it! She told me the rent was too high. How much are you asking? She wanted to spend 3000 francs. The apartment is 4000. Please call her and agree to 3000 francs. I'll pay the difference. Very well. Thank you. Did I mention that the studio next door is also available? If you want to join them, we can remove the wall between. It would be perfect for a couple. Definitely not. Thanks. What do you want? If you're not still at Ti and Maud's, meet me at my parents' We're having pigeons a la francaise. If not, see you tomorrow. Hugs and kisses! It's me. Fanfan. I need to talk to you. Tonight at 8, at the Renaissance. Don't be late. Believe it or not, today I met the girl of my dreams. Her name is Laure. You've been with her for 5 years. Maud told me. Now stop lying and choose: your Laure or me. If it's her, stop being ambiguous. Okay? Pinch me. You wanted a "simple relationship". You know thay were just words... to make you feel what you were making me feel. I've always been... Tell me I was dreaming. All you want is a close friend. Exactly. Stop. Be honest, please. For once. Fanfan, all I want is to be friends. You've misunderstood. Of course. The candle-lit dinner, Vienna... I dreamt it all. Yes. I dreamt it? Why are you playing with me? I go out of my way to be frank and patient. But I can prove that you've often desired me and that you desire me at this very moment. You can prove it? Easily. Go ahead. I have smelled your desire from day one. A sexually aroused man exudes a special odor. He secretes hormones, like all other mammals. You're good. That's smart reasoning. But I'm not a chimpanzee. I know what I feel. What good is love, if it ends up like that? On sundays, he pampers his car while she caresses yellowed wedding photos. You must have a strange mother to be so scared of women, and to trust me so little. It's hot. If only I could wake up at the sea, at Mammy's. Excuse me. I have to pee. So? We're such good friends... it would be like sleeping with my sister. Great! Well, you have your life, I have mine. No more games, okay? It really is hot in here. No more games! This peppermint tastes strange. Can you drive me home? Tomorrow I'm moving to Palais Royal. The owner agreed to 3000 francs. I'm bushed! How much was he asking? 4000 A little pricey. Where are we? It's just a shortcut. Where are we? No more games! It's not too cold? yes! Usually I swim all year long. Can you do my back? At this time of year? The UV rays pass through the clouds. Didn't you know? Lower. Alexander! Alexander! It's me! Hello. I'm Laure. Fanfan. I know you like surprises. You like it when I'm unpredictable. I have good news. Everything is set: the band, the caterer. We're getting married. I have more good news. I'm finally pregnant. Congratulations. There's a mosquito on your cheek. Have a nice wedding. Make a nice baby. Fanfan. Where are you going? Where are you going? If you were with her, maybe it was my fault. Listen to me! If you want to screw here, go ahead! Stop. Calm down! Go get it over with! Nothing happened! Fuck her once and for all! Fanfan! Come back! He wants to make love to you! Come back! Stop! Fanfan, if you want to pass the test, Turn the pages, at least once every ten minutes. Are you okay? Yes. What's wrong? Nothing, Paul. Amber...a drop of musk... honeysuckle... Concentrate, Miss. A little rosewater... a drop of musk... honeysuckle... I don't know what's wrong. Continue. I can't. I don't smell anything. There. I've finished the invitations. Can you go mail them? Hurry. We're already behind. Okay. Meanwhile, I'll run some errands. How about lemon chicken and apple pie tonight? Fine. If you pass by a drugstore, get me some valium, tampons and vitamin C. Did you say tampons? I meant cotton balls. Are you really pregnant? I'm sorry. I panicked on the beach. It just came out. How could you? Alexander, ask yourself that question. Why marry me? Why say one thing when you want another? You wanted a little housewife who bakes apple pies. You got one. You wanted me to remain your sex kitten. I tried. But you didn't notice. You were blind. Taxi! Shit! What an ass! Who's that? Maud when she was 30. She was twice as old when you met her. This is how I see her now. Laure left me. The wedding is off. She's the one who left? For good? And kissing Fanfan can only result in the same disaster. I don't understand. You're young, sensual. You've got a dick! You have no desire... Yes. I mean a physical desire. No craving for sex? At your age? At your age, I'd have fucked an ostrich. I want to live with her... But without the daily grind. There must be a solution. And Fanfan? Have you thought about her? Yes. Everyone accepts that passion dies. And that makes me puke! You're worse than the Princess of Cleves! A word of warning: Fanfan won't wait. When will she be back? She's left for ten days...with friends. Ten days? What do I do to transfer my calls? Just call the operator. Why? No reason. Thanks. Hello? Miss Laure de Chantebise? Yes, sort of. The final touches. Thank you. Alexander. I'm not as dumb as you think. and I'm not a masochist either. If you need to play games to feel virile, you might as well stay impotent. Ciao! That's what I should have said from the start. From now on, it's over. This is Fanfan. Sorry to bother you. What a nice surprise! I wanted to apologize for slapping you. And I think it's better this way. Let's just stay friends. Okay. If you want to see me, you have my number. So long. What about after your bath? How do you know I'm taking a bath? Be...be...because I hear an echo. A sort of lapping sound. Why? Aren't you in the bathtub? Yes, I'm in my bath. What about tonight? Are you in Paris? Yes, but I'm a little tired. If you want, we can spend another weekend together. Are you free this weekend? Yes. Okay, then Let's meet at the station tomorrow. There's a train at 8:12 Perfect. Bye. Goodbye. This is harder to live than I had thought it would be. I'm not a voyeur, Fanfan. I just want to live with you, without the daily grind. Without the routine. I love you. I love you. Good night, little sister. My little twin. Good night, my love. Fanfan. Paul, Alexander. Alexander, Paul. Hi there. Let's go. I'm thrilled for both of you. You make a ... wonderful couple. Full of... grace. Yes, that's the word. I'm happy to see you together. Wait. Can you repeat that? With the same gestures. You were good. Please. I was deeply moved by the sincerity of it. Am I that ridiculous? There's no shame in being jealous. I told him everything. I know Fanfan had a soft spot for you. I came here... to straighten things out between us. Fanfan wants to preserve your... your friendship. It would be nice of you to stop the ambiguous game-playing. Okay? Okay. I'm dying of thirst. Can you get me some juice? My pleasure. Would you like some juice too? A whisky, please. I'd bash his face in, but he's a nice guy. Really nice. Handsome, self-confident... does he play tennis? You want to beat him up? May be. He's the Paul you mentioned? Yeah. I thought it was over. We broke up a few times. But in Italy, we got back together for good. I made a choice. I couldn't wait for you forever. Of course not. It's over with Laure. The baby was a lie. A bluff. Is that your only reaction? It's too late. Fanfan has a favor to ask you. No, Paul. Not this weekend. Why not? We're comfortable here, among friends. Paul! Make your grandmother happy! Are you pregnant? No, Mammy. We're getting married. Honey! We'd like you both to be our witnesses. It's a deal! You'll bring us good luck. Where will the ceremony be? We were hoping to have it here. I'll take care of everything. You're invited, of course. Okay... Thanks for everything. Can I have some water? Shit. Him again! He's starting to bust my balls. Fanfan, I'd like to spend the night here. No. I can't help loving you. Paul, you acted your role perfectly. but let's stop there. Why choose me to make Alexander jealous? You know very well... Oh shit! Paul, we agreed. I'm ashamed. I was tense all weekend. I felt like throwing up at dinner. It wasn't me! I'm dreaming! You asked me to sleep with you to drive him crazy I couldn't even touch you! I'm sorry! You're as scheming as Alexander. I'm not like him! I lost my head! That can happen to me too! I'm not what you think! You'd love me to forgive you. to give you that leasure. Well I won't forgive you! You acted like a bitch! You used me and your grandmother! Leave my grandmother out of this! She agreed. So did you! Shit! Sleeping with me isn't like jumping from a bridge! I'm sorry. What do you see in him? He makes me laugh. He troubles me. He keeps me guessing. When I see him, it's always like the first time. He'll never be a husband... Hold on. He's monster...a selfish monster! I thought so too... then 10 days ago, I learned that I have this studio thanks to him. If it becomes unbearable, call me. Paul, I'm sorry. It was a joke? No, he ordered mirrors from my supplier. One-way mirrors. That barbarian wants to live with Fanfan, without the inconveniences of coupledom, without soggy earplugs... What a bastard! I'm broad-minded, but all the same! Fanfan is not an object. And you defend Alexander! I didn't say anything! I can read your mind! Maud, promise me you won't tell Fanfan. Alexander trusted me...man to man. Promise me. You cheat! Snake! I promise! Alexander? I know everything. Mammy told me. Tell me you're there. Give me a signal. Give me a signal or I'll bust this mirror! I'm here. I'm here. Alexander... When you left for Italy, I ran after the bus. Like a mad man. But when it stopped, I didn't get on. Because... I realized that in 5 years I'd no longer run after it. Stop. Cut the small talk. Tell me the truth, the real truth. When I was a kid, my mother's door was always closed in the morning. whenever she forgot to lock it... I found...another man in her bed. The first time, it hurt so much, I stopped feeling. Yes, but with me you feel alive. You feel you love me! I know that. Fanfan, love always turns sour. Come. Come. No! Take me for real. I need flesh. I want you to breathe me, to touch me. I need your skin, your hands, your back, your neck. I need to feel you in me. Come now. I don't want to lose you. What do you feel? Do you enjoy this? Yes. You want to have power over me? It can't work like that! I'm spent, Alexander. Work out your childhood, your fears and dreams. Be in my room tomorrow at 10, or you'll never see me again. When you find this letter, it will be too late. I will have gone to meet my sister. Maud? It's Alexander. Does Fanfan have a sister? Yes. Do you know what time it is? Where is her sister? It's late! Where is her sister? She killed herself when she was 15. She jumped into the Seine. Where is her sister? She's dead, Alexander. Fanfan never told you? Alexander? Tomorrow morning, I'll leave you. Tomorrow? You'll have until the evening to win me back. I'll leave you every morning.
