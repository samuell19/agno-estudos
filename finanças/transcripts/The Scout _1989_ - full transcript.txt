In the name of the Lord of all Beauties and Delicacies Scout Mehrdad Soleimani Alireza Heidari Gholamreza Aliakbari Asghar Pourhajerian Cinematographer: Mohsen Zolanvar Music: Seyed Mohammad Mirzamani Sound: Mohsen Roshan Edit: Mohsen Makhmalbaf Production manager: Abdullah Bakideh Producer: War Division of Farabi Cinema Foundation Written and directed by: Ebrahim Hatamikia What happened? They shot it. (Oh Imam Hussein). I have to go. Where to? What do you think? The front. What about these? If I take these along, I won't be able to move. You know that a machine gun can't stop a tank. Then why am I going? Do you want to stop all those tanks alone? You don't want me to brag, do you? Huh? If possible, I'll take a few as souvenirs. Okay? If you see (Hajj Hamid), tell him I did my best. Okay, sure. Brother. Brother. He's traumatized. How are you? I'm fine. Can't be better. Are you a scout? How do you know? You'll find out when you go. Hurry up, they need you. What shall I do with you? You're not supposed to do anything. We wanted to come to you, but it became the opposite. Get up and go. It's no time for such words. Down with Saddam. Down with Saddam. Down with Saddam. He thinks he's a captive. This place is safer than outside. The guys will come after us tonight. Why don't you understand? They need you. Do you have more of these? How many do you need? Roll it up for now. (Hassan), how many times did I tell you it's handy to learn to use a Dushka? You said Dushka is useless compared to RPG. Well. Now which one is useless? Stop having high hopes. This weapon of yours isn't even a fly's buzz for the tanks. Don't be afraid. It's only a fly's buzz! (Reza). Don't waste bullets. You'll need them. I just loaded it. I was testing it (Hajji). (Hajj Hamid). Someone's coming down the road. Who can it be? I don't know. Maybe it's the scout. The scout?! No. Didn't they go after him? They did. But I heard they didn't get to him. What about the missiles? What can I say? If the personnel carrier doesn't return, it means... How many missiles do we have? How many?! Yes. Let me count. A total of one. Get back to your posts! Hello. Hello. Power to you. Thank you. I'm (Arefi). I know. (Hajji)! Their tank is coming! May God help us. It stopped. (Hassan). The sniper on the left. (Gholam) Yes? Left side of the factory. (Reza), gather your stuff. Hurry up! It's hot. The pipe is hot. My hand is burning. Move faster. At last I got to taste my own medicine! Let me do that for you. Thank you, I can manage. (Reza), that's all I have. Buzz them off, so I can move forward. (Hassan). Yes? Come here. Yes? (Hassan), be careful. Give me a loaded one. Careful about myself or this? Of course, yourself! Why should I (Hajji)? If this missile gets wasted, I'll become as useless as this weapon. What are you talking about? Give it to me! I was joking. Is it a crime? What are you saying? Where's your trust in God? At least give us a heads up! Stop fooling around. The tank is here. Wait! These are Godsend. Where did you bring these from? From my city, as gifts. May God bestow you a gift. I wish the same for you. Thank you. Hurry up (Hassan). (Hassan). Don't forget the special prayers. (Hajji). Where's the radioman? It's (Rasoul). He's in that trench. (Reza), can you see the tank's shooter? Don't let him spot (Hassan). Distract him. Be careful not to hit (Hassan)! Keep aiming at him. He's spotted (Hassan). Power to you. Thank you. Nice job! Thank you. Well done. Thank you. Hey buzzer man, do your flies attack friends as well?! What do you mean? You would've shot me, if I hadn't moved. It's your fault, you get too close. Hello. Power to you (Hajji). Thank you. Stay there. I want to change your clothes. We have a guest today. This is for our guest. They say, a guest is a friend of God. (Hajji). We're reaching the verse. "Verily We have granted thee a manifest Victory" Al-Fath Surah, verse 1. May God accept. I hope so. Pray for me. I'm needy of prayers myself. How did you come here? I walked all the way. Why don't you ask for fire coverage? Please. (Ishmael), go ahead. You go ahead. I have some work to do. I asked them to stop it. Why? If the back isn't supported, the front will be endangered. Of course. Right. But there's no one to locate the exact targets. As the roads are tangent to our lines... ...one missile will hit them and 2 will hit us. It isn't worth the hassle. (Ghasem) was transferred to the hospital. - Hello. - Hello. Was there any vacancy at the hospital? No, but they didn't have a janitor. He took the position. Get out of here. He insisted. I said, what's the difference? He said it does differ now. I'll bring the radio. Have you eaten anything? I will, there's no rush. Then let me tell you the situation. This is our own ambush. This. This is the connecting route. This one has a view on the road. The left Iraqi ambush. They just try to annoy us. They can't move forward. This is their main ambush. Right opposite us. This is the radio report. (Ishmael), please give food to the guys. Okay, sure. I think... ...if we can't manage to preserve the line until nighttime... ...it'll fall apart. I'm taking food for them. Godspeed. We only had one connecting way to (Aghabeh), through personnel carriers. And we don't have it anymore. Well. They must've had their lunch and desert by now. (Greetings to Imam Hussein). Now they'll start their elephant army. They enter the field with total confidence. Let's move on to the confidential report. If you had come with a personnel carrier... ...I would say, you've come too late. If they had sent you with a chute... ...again I would say, you've come too late. But when I saw you come by foot... ...I didn't dare to mention such a thing. I was worried... ...and your presence calmed me down. I can't describe my feelings. But when I saw you walking down the road... ...I didn't see you alone. Brother (Arefi). This is no place for praising. This army of elephants has to be stopped. I want to dare and ask you... ...to do this. Brother (Hamid). I'm called a fire coverage guide. They're mistaken. God does the absolute guiding. "When thou threw a handful of dust, it was not thy act, but Allah's." (Hajj Hamid), hurry up. You've totally disgraced me. What did you say? You've made me your buzzer machine porter! This buzzer, as you say, finished off the tank. God forbid. (Reza), what calumny is this? Where did the flies hit... So you finished it off, huh?! What are you waiting for? Pick it up! Come on! What's the problem? Nothing, it's the pipe. Come on, pick it up! Where are you going? I'm going to the winter quarters. Power to you. What's up? We're going to (Reza)'s winter quarters. (Rasoul), go to the trench. (Rasoul). Put the radio on standby. Moslem. Moslem. Mahdi. Moslem. Moslem. Mahdi. Mahdi. Moslem, I read you. (Moslem), standby. Moslem, write this down. (G.D.H.5300). (Ramadan. Yellow. Blue. Black. Grey.) Copy that? Repeat it. (Ramadan). (Yellow). (Blue). (Black). (Grey). (M.D.H) (440) (Moslem), write down Moharam. (Red. Red. Grey). (Red. Red. Grey). Copy that? Copy that, standby. Mahdi. Moslem. (God is almighty). Fire! Mahdi. Moslem. (Khomeini is our leader) Have you opened a new kiosk next to my kiosk?! There's so much space here. Why do you have to ruin my business? God is the provider, don't worry. Everything has its own place and... (Hassan), it's no time for jokes. Let us concentrate. Have you heard from your brother? 50 left, rise 20. Moslem. Mahdi. Mahdi. Moslem, I read you. (Moslem), 50 left, rise 20. Roger that. Standby. How is he? Mahdi. Moslem. I read you. (God is Almighty) It's ready. Fire! (Khomeini is the leader). I sent him to the hospital. He was gazing at me last night. I asked what's wrong. He said I want to fulfil my eyes with you. I joked and said are you the passenger or me?! He said, it doesn't make any difference. The angels are waiting for both of you. Didn't I tell you? Moslem. Mahdi. Mahdi. Moslem, I read you. What are you guys doing? How come? Who's riding the horse? (Saghafi). (Saghafi)?! Isn't (Kowsari) there? Yes, he's here. Then why doesn't he ride the horse? What's wrong (Mahdi)? Thank God, it was resolved. But don't send such nuts anymore. Freshen up the horse. Send a nut. Do you read me? Roger that. Standby. You're still here! What's wrong with you? Didn't you see the mortar shell landed here? Even the winter quarter isn't safe. Why are you sulking? Wait up for me. Wait, I have to bring these. I'm coming. Power to you. Enjoy it. Mahdi. Moslem. I read you. (God is Almighty). It's ready. If the problem is solved, fire! (Khomeini is the leader) Good. Only 10 to the left. Register this as target 1. Register it as martyr Baba Kazemi 1. Add 300 to Baba Kazemi. (Moslem), add 300 to Baba Kazemi. Do you read me? Roger that, standby. I don't think these mortar shells are from the front. Mahdi. Moslem. I read you. (God is Almighty) It's ready. Fire! (Khomeini is the leader) Good. That's it. (Rasoul)? (Rasoul)? (Rasoul). (Rasoul). I'm fine. I'm fine. Get on with your work. Medic! Medic! (Ishmael)! Moslem. Mahdi. Moslem. Mahdi. Moslem. Mahdi. (Hajj Hamid), I need a radio. There's only one left. It's in the trench. I have to go. (Rasoul). (Hassan), get on with your work. (Rasoul). I have to go now. (Rasoul). (Ishmael), take him away. (Ahmad)! (Ahmad), come and help. Come on. Moslem. Mahdi. Moslem. Mahdi. Moslem. Mahdi. (Mahdi), stitch registered targets 1 and 2. Copy that? Power to you. I bet their secondary ambush is doing this. I'll go there. Keep them busy for now. Godspeed. (Naser). Yes? Cease fire for now. Okay (Hajji). I said stop shooting. Let them reach rifle range. Come (Hassan). How many missiles do we have? 3 or 4. Look. Do you see that? I want you to stop it right next to that burned tank. Is that clear? You want a road block, right? Exactly. What about the soldiers? They might stop me. You have every right (Hassan). You can stay if you want. Stay?! The choice is yours. (Reza), what happened to your trust in God? Move on my order (Hassan). Are you ready? Yes, I'm ready. Fire! Go (Hassan)! Good, that's it. Register the target as Martyr Khosh. (Hajji). Take a look over there. (Hajji), I'll go to the end of the embankment. The vision error is too much from the opposite. I have to view it from the side. (May Imam Ali help you) The sooner the better. Brother (Arefi). We used all of your gifts. Now it's you and the front. Trust in God. Send someone with me. Working alone slows me down. I'll send someone by the time you get there. You did great, warrior. Wait. (Ishmael). (Ishmael). Is it you? Hello. Hello. Power to you. How are the guys? How's it going? Good. Very good. Aren't their tanks coming? They are. But the guys are finishing them off enroute. Are you saying this to please me? I don't want you to lie. There's no need for consolation. No, no. That wasn't my intention. It's the truth. I don't know. Maybe I would've said the same, if I were in your shoes. Why don't you believe me? How can I? They've cut off the line. There are no RPGs. What's happening? One of the guys has joined us. He's brought RPGs. And he's a scout. A scout?! So (Rasoul) is very busy. You're... ...(Rasoul)'s brother?! Yes. So this is the hospital. Yes. Are they wounded? Do you need any help? Who are you? What's your name? What difference does it make? I'm a humble guilty man. You smell of a good scent. Tell me the truth, who are you? I told you. Now let me go to my post. God be with you. Moslem. Moslem. Mahdi. Moslem. Moslem. Mahdi. Moslem. Moslem. Mahdi. I read you. (Moslem), my position is (Ali 25). Do you read me? (Ali 25). (Ali 25), copy that. Moslem. Mahdi. Moslem. Mahdi. I read you. (Moslem), shut down on target 2. Prepare a nut; throw it in its throat by my order. Copy that? Roger that. Standby. Hello. Man, pay attention. Even 1 or 2 meters away, will be useless. Drop 4 and send another nut. Copy that? Roger that. Hello. Sorry, I'm in a hurry. Did (Hajj Hamid) send you? Yes, he asked me to come. There aren't enough... ...men there. I was around and he sent me. What shall I do now? Good. 3 more nuts, same position. Hurry up. I'm single handed. I might need help. You might?! What shall I do? Nothing for now. I could at least do something, if I were there. Why am I here, if I'm not supposed to do anything? Great. 3 left, send 3 more nuts. Hurry up! That's good (Moslem). Stitch targets 1 and 2 on both horses. Don't stop until I tell you. What's wrong brother? (Oh Imam Hussein) My eyes. My eyes are bursting. Forget about me. Go. The guys will be massacred, if they come. (Oh Imam Hussein). (Oh Imam Hussein). Mahdi. Mahdi. Moslem. Mahdi. Mahdi. Moslem. Mahdi. Mahdi. Moslem. (Moslem), I read you. Where are you? Are you receiving the nuts? Something came up. Standby. Are you fine? Yes. Moslem. Mahdi. Moslem. Mahdi. (Moslem), the nuts are great. Keep going. (Mahdi), can one of the horses rest? Rest?! Now?! No way! Do you read me? Copy that. My eyes. My eyes are burning. Hang on! How are the guys doing? They're fine. They're great. They're route is blocked. One of their tanks is trapped. Now the guys can batter them. What's the use? Soon they'll be surrounded from the back. Don't let your loader get empty. No. It's still loaded. I have another one and a few grenades. Have you been shot in the waist as well? It's fine. I'm sorry. I was ungrateful. I thought they've sent me for no good reason. Forgive me. A good servant of God is useful anywhere. He'll never get wasted. How long have you been here? 3 days. If those cowards pass us, they'll surround our men. They'll cut through! Who do they think they're dealing with? You and I won't let them. Me? I'm just in your way. No. If you hadn't noticed, God knows what would've happened to us. Calm down. Calm down. Don't talk. God, don't let the guys get massacred. So you're not listening to me, huh? I said we wouldn't let them pass us. Mahdi. Moslem. Mahdi. Moslem. I read you. (Mahdi), why don't you make contact? Is it a feast? Is that you (Ahmad)? You got it. We miss you. What a feast it is! Don't forget your horses. They're very tired. May your enemy be tired. Is (Mohammad) there? Which (Mohammad)? Your in-law? Yes, I want to talk to him. Mahdi. Moslem. Mahdi. Moslem. I read you. I hope you have good news. What do you think (Mohammad)? I bet you're gathering the booty. Booty? No (Mohammad), wrong guess. We've encountered a feast and it's only the beginning. Aren't you in position 25? Mahdi. Mahdi. Do you read me? Mahdi. Mahdi. Do you read me? Mahdi. Mahdi. Mahdi. Mahdi. Do you read me? Mahdi. Mahdi. Moslem. Mahdi. Mahdi. Moslem. Listen (Mohammad), don't be curious. The feast has already started. Stop acting like a hero. Retreat! Retreat?! They'll shower me with bullets, if I move. (Mahdi), what are you saying? We're out of time. I have to change the frequency. Keep the registered targets. I'll do my best. The rest is God's will. Pray for me. Brother. How are you? Brother. (Oh Imam Hussein). This isn't fair. Weren't you supposed to help me? You're breaching your promise. Moslem. Mahdi. Moslem. Mahdi. Moslem. Mahdi. I read you (Mahdi). How are you? Can't be better. (Moslem), I found a solution. This is your own position. No. God willing, soon it'll be a hell for Iraqis. Aren't you there?! Man, do I belong in hell?! I swear you to (Saint Fatimah), finish it off. You have to promise to leave the location. Okay, I promise. How many nuts? Send a shower of candies. I'll keep my promise. I'll join him. I'm coming (Hajji). Come! Come straight ahead. That's it! (Hajji), they kept it intact for us! Yes, right. Welcome. Power to you. Thank you. Guys, split up and help the guys in the trenches. Hurry up! (Hajji), what's going on over there? They've shot down the scout. 7, 8 of you go with (Hajji). (Mohammad), go with them.
