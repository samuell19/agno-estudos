Chicken's almost done. Mom? I'll start preparing the salad if you like? Sure, that'd be great Margaret. I'll get you a few things for it. Mom, I'm hungry. We'll eat soon, Jennifer, okay, as soon as your father gets here. Thank you. Do you think we've got enough beer? He won't want beer when he gets home. He's gonna need whiskey. Now, David, don't go getting Christopher drunk now. Why not? He's on shore leave, he can do whatever he wants. I hope he'll wanna spend time with his family. What about John? Is he planning on showing up tonight? John? Planning something? There's a new one. Well, maybe you should give him a call. He'll wanna be here. I've tried three times already. He never answers. I'll try again. Really? Hey bro, good game. Thanks dude. Although, I think you take this shit a little too seriously, man. It's just street football. That's because we're the best, brah. You guys are delusional. Yeah, street football is like our thing. Unlike people running you down like that. He's just jealous, dude, forget about it. So, I take it you guys play a lot? Oh yeah, all the time. We're like backyard champions of LA. Yeah, from Glendale all the way down to Long Beach. Past Long Beach, bro, way past. Yeah, but we're unstoppable. John here, he's our secret weapon. Who's on the barbecue? It smells awesome. He's drunk. Well, it's good to have skills. What, drinking? He's really good at that. No, I mean... I think it's his last drawing. I have skills too, by the way. Really? You mean besides running with a ball? I'm sorry. That's fair, kind of. What other skills do you have? I fix things. Really? Like what? Anything, stuff around the house, plumbing, motorbikes. I just spent a month up at Big Sur helping a guy build a pizza oven. It took a month to build a pizza oven? Man, this thing was huge. You could fit like five pizzas at once. Plus, I had a lot of cervezas, okay. I'm a busy man. Actually, you know what? I think I might need something fixed. Really? Yeah, my truck, there is this noise. Your truck has a noise? Yeah. I think I should come around some time and take a look at your truck. What are you doin' tomorrow? Well... Is this your phone, dude? Yeah. It's been ringing all afternoon. Hello. Hey! Where are you going? I have to go. I'll call you tomorrow. He's always doing that. But I didn't give him my number. Oh, I'll give you his number. Good. 'Cause I really need my truck fixed. Sure. Despite what you've seen in the movies, traveling through space is not the same as driving down the I-95, where the speed limit's more of a suggestion than an actual limit. The speed of light is it. Nothing moves faster. Even at that speed it would take decades to reach our closest neighbors. For now, we're stuck here on this rock, Earth. Boring. Well, let's not forget that this boring little planet is home. It looks pretty small from here, but it holds everything in your life. Your family, your friends, everything you've ever known, everything you wanna be. It's all we've got, so take care of it, protect it. Hey Tracy! Hi! Ugh! I am so glad this week's over. Wait, you actually have weekends? I know I should be researching, but it's so hard. You know, Melissa, you don't actually have to go to every party you're invited to. I know. Actually speaking of parties, what are your plans this weekend? Well, if you must know, I'm going on a date tonight. A date! I thought I was the one having too much fun. Who's the lucky guy? I, I kind of met him online. It's probably gonna be a total disaster. No, don't say that. Online dating is totally fine. Ever normal people are doing it these days. Wow, you're really filling me with confidence right now, thanks Mel. Look, if he turns out to be a jerk, I'm having some people over tomorrow, you should totally come. We'll drink champagne, we can laugh about it, and then by mid afternoon you'll be too drunk to care. Hello! Earth to Ms. Gleeson. Sorry. So, you're thinking of joining the army now? Seriously? Lunch tomorrow sounds good. Good, because I bought this new dress, and I'm not sure but I think Ill wear it. It's just the perfect little cut. It's got this heart shape here. We should stop for a seismic, Stan. Yeah, we just did. We're runnin' out of time. We need to reach the objective. Remember what Jackson said, measure stealth not speed. And keep your mouth shut. You want more gravy? Chris? - What? - Gravy? No, thank you. Uncle John! Hey! Argh! Sorry I'm late. I had a bunch of errands to run. Thanks for coming, John. It's good to see ya' buddy! Give your damn brother a hug, Chris. It's good to have you back. Thanks. I hear you made Lieutenant. I thought you might want these to celebrate. Thanks, man. Come and eat, John. There's plenty left. Smells awesome, thanks. Hey! Chicken, potatoes. Great! So, have you been keeping yourself busy, John? Yeah, ever since I came back to LA, it's just been nonstop. Been fixin' up this guy's kitchen for the past week. Plumbing, is it? Carpentry mostly. Bench tops, cabinet doors, that kind of thing. He wants to turn the house into a bed and breakfast, you know, one of those internet things. Internet things? Yeah, don't ask me how it works, but a bunch of my friends are doing it. Well, it's a great achievement owning your own home, something you could aspire to. Sure, I'll just wait for the 1940s to come back so I could afford it. Well, things ain't what they used to be, but when Margaret and I bought our first home up in Granada Hills there was almost nothing there. And it was cheap land too. Excuse me. Good evening. Do you have a booking tonight? Yeah... I'm with that guy, I think, sort of? That's fine, go on through. Byron? - Yes, Tracy. - That's me. - Hi. - Sorry I'm late. No, it's fine, take a seat, please. So, have you looked at the menu, or... Yeah, yeah, it looks good. That's the wine list though. Oh, of course, right. Good evening, how are you? Can I get you two anything to drink to start off? Yeah, wine please. Merlot. Sure, a glass? Bottle. Did you want somethin' to drink, or? Maybe we could share the Merlot? Great idea, two glasses please. Sure. Thank you. Sorry, I'm nervous. That's fine, just relax. I know, I know, I'll be fine. Merlot's coming. You're not gonna bail on me now, are ya'? I don't know what you've been through, but it's good to have you back, Brother. I'm not back. Not really. Okay, I understand that, but it's just straight logic. If there are infinite universes with infinite variations then somewhere there must be a universe that's just like ours with a galaxy just like ours, even the same planet Earth, even the same us at a restaurant drinking too much red wine. Just 'cause it seems logical doesn't make it true. We can't even do tests to find out if there are actually parallel universes. But what about CERN? CERN hasn't proven anything. It's pointless just even talkin' about this. We might as well be discussing astrology. Okay, fine. What would you like to talk about then? I don't know, astrology. You're not enjoying this are you? I'm sorry. I'm probably just tired. I spend all day talkin' about this stuff, and to be honest I'm kind of over it. Can we just get the check, please? Sure. Excuse me, can we have the check please? The president has promised to continue the mission in Northern Africa for as long as it takes to secure peace. Despite American casualties now numbering over 5,000, and many soldiers returning from the region will face years of rehabilitation, both physically and psychologically. Can you believe people are actually signing up to fight in this stupid war? Anyone dumb enough to enlist in the military deserves what's coming to them. Maybe some things aren't that simple. War is stupid. It seems pretty simple to me. Can we not talk about this, please? Sure. Good work. Thanks. That's our objective. How are we supposed to get up there? We'll crawl from the northwest. But for now, we need to place to hold off for the night. Any idea what those are? Old forts from the war? The last one. Let's check it out. Mai Tai? What? I can't drink both of these myself. Sure. Thanks. Damn, it's hot. Yeah. I think there's a thunderstorm coming, though. Yeah, I heard thunder. So, how's it lookin'? It's looking really good. I meant the car. Oh, the car, right. Yeah, it's gonna need a lot of work. I might have to clear my schedule. Dude, I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to stop you there. There was a report coming in of some kind of attack in the South Pacific. People are saying a bunch of giant aircraft just appeared out of nowhere. They're like, not from Earth. What? Wow! Yeah! The president's about to make an announcement. What we're seeing now is video footage recorded just a few hours ago in Manila, where the US Navy is engaged in a full scale battle. This is truly astonishing what we're seeing here. More reports are coming in from all over the South Pacific. This is crazy. Parallel universes. What? Does anyone have family on the West Coast? I have an aunt in Santa Barbara, but this is happening in the Philippines. It's just starting. Tell your aunt to head east, as far from the Pacific as possible. But where are you going? I think I'm gonna follow my brother. But didn't her brother die? I don't care, just any flight heading northeast. - Mom, Mom... - Toronto if possible. What's going on? David, no, carry on will have you drawing. Sir, as soon as my family is safe, I'll drive straight to Pendleton. Chris, I can help. Just a second, sir. They want me back right away. I'll get 'em to the airport. You could trust me. I'll be there right away, sir. God damn, worse timing. Anne's car is in the shop, and I need mine to get to the base. Can you take yours? Yeah, yeah, of course. I have to go. We've got a flight in two and a half hours. You go, we'll be fine. Be good for your mom, okay. Watch your back, son. Always. Come on, my car's ready. Why don't you come with us, John? I'm sure they'll be room on the plane. I'm gonna stay. - Help out however I can. - You're a good man, John. Come on, let's get some bags. - Everyone buckled up? - Yes! You should take better care of your car, John. The key's gettin' messy. John, we're gonna miss the flight. Perhaps we should call a cab? No, I know someone who could help. Yeah, I know we've missed this flight, what I'm asking is if we could get a connecting flight from somewhere else, take this exit. I know, I've driven to LAX before! I don't care, anywhere around there will do. Greenland would be fine. - Montreal? - Yeah. Yeah, yeah, Montreal. Great! Book that in! We're on our way, thank you. Hope you all can speak French, you're goin' to Montreal. That's wonderful, thank you John. Is it a direct flight? Stop over in San Fran, but it's only an hour. We're saying ciao by nightfall. Well, that's Italian, John, - but thank you nonetheless. - You're welcome. You're sure you won't come with us. No, there's something else I gotta do. Almost, they'll be fine. Chris, I gotta ask you something... I want to enlist, bro. Tell me what I gotta do. Today... The sun rises on a new chapter in our nation's history, and the history of every nation in the world. Today... For the first time in over half a century... Our world is at war. We are both extremely saddened by the death of your family, Lieutenant. We want you to know that Anne, Jennifer, and your mother and father are in the thoughts and prayers of all of us in the 15th MEU. We will fight in their honor, and the honor of everyone who was killed in the attack on Los Angeles. I promise we will not stop until every one of those metal bastards is driven back to wherever the hell they came from. I'll go wherever I'm needed. I'll fight if I have to. - Lieutenant... - Outstanding, Lieutenant! Your resilience in North Africa was inspirational. What I wanted to say was... And we both believe that you would make and excellent platoon leader of the 15th. I'd be honored, sir. Fortunately, we have some time though. For now, the 15th is taking some time to rest, to take stock and recharge. We're all needed after the hell we went through over there. We lost a lot of good Marines. Yeah, it was a shit storm, all right, but we still kicked their asses, and we will do the same again when we take the fight up to these metal bastards across the Pacific. But right now, we got a bunch of new recruits heading off to Paris Island for training, and I need someone who can kick 'em into shape before they ship out in 10 weeks. You think you can do that? Certainly, sir. There are counselors on that base there too, Lieutenant. I know nothing will ever make it right, but they can help you cope. Yeah... There ain't no therapy like screaming your ass off at a bunch of wet knuckleheads. Am I right, Lieutenant? Look, I need my best men in this fight, Jackson. So, you do whatever you gotta do. Go check on your brother, John, right? He's on his way to Paris Island right now. I have my doubts about him, sir. Well, if anyone can make soldiers of these boys, it's you, Lieutenant. I'll certainly try, sir. I know you will. The more we push him, Colonel, the worse it'll be for him when he breaks. I'm all right with that, Major. Just as long as we win. Is this seat taken? I'm Tracy. Oh, John. You can probably call me Blake. Oh, right, sir names, yeah. Uh, Gleeson. So, has anyone shouted in your face yet? No. - Does that really happen? - Yeah, I think so. To be honest this was kind of a spur of the moment thing. I don't know how I feel about it yet. Not much we can do about it now. Yeah, I think that's only just starting to hit me. What the hell are you knuckleheads doing? Get your asses out here and fall in line? Move, move, move! Stand up straight! Eyes front! What is your name? Eyes front, god dammit! When I give you an order, you will obey. Now what the fuck is your name? Dreyfus, sir. No, it is not! What is your name? Eyes front, god dammit! Lewis, sir! No, it is not! What is your name? Wilcox, sir! Wrong! What is your name! Gleeson, sir, it really is Gleeson! No, it is not! What is your name? It's John Blake, really. It's on my driver's license if you wanna take a look. Really? You wanna show me your drivers license? Then show it to me! No? That's right, you can't show me your drivers license because all your stuff was confiscated before you arrived on this island! So, were you just being a smart ass, recruit? Were you being a god damn smart ass? Yes, sir, I was being a smart ass, sir. Get your face on the floor, and give me 20 pushups for being a god damn smart ass! Now, shit brain! Does anyone else feel like being a smart ass? No? Good! Because that attitude will get you, the man fighting beside you, and everyone you fight to protect all dead. We are at war with an enemy that does not care who you are or who you think you are. It does not care about honor and glory. It is here to wipe everything you have ever known off the face of the earth. Your pride as a Marine, your service to your country, your sacrifice for the greater good. All count for nothing! The only thing standing between the machines and total annihilation of the human race is your ability to aim your gun and shoot. You are either a machine killer... Or you are dead. Now... For the last god damn time... What is your name? How about machine killer, sir? Say it like you mean it? Machine killer, sir! What is your name? Machine killer, sir! What is your name? Machine killer, sir! What is your name? Machine killer, sir! Good, mess hall, five minutes. If you're late, you're out! Chris? That's Lieutenant, recruit. Sorry, sir. You did the right thing by joining up, but my job is to watch over the first wave of new recruits, not pat you on the back. You work hard, you follow orders. And don't fuck this up. Stay calm! Breath! Your weapon is your ally! Read it well! And it will protect you! Relax those shoulders, Gleeson. Nice work. Let me ask you a question. Who here has seen an enemy drone? You from Los Angeles? So, you know what we're up against? Yeah, I've seen what they can do. After seeing the horrors that these drones can cause, this man... Chooses to fight. What would you do? Why don't we find out? Your instinct is right. The first thing you do when you see an enemy drone is hide. You... You would've been shot. We've been collecting these things ever since they showed up in the South Pacific, and believe me, we are doing everything we can to figure them out. Luis? If you can control the things, why aren't we using them against the machines? We've tried. The machines just override our signal. Anything we send into battle, ends up being used against out our own soldiers. Hell, even our own drones are susceptible to hijacking from the enemy carriers, no! Right now we are depending on the best most reliable weapon we have. That's us. Soldiers, like you and me. This machine can see you. It can hear you. Hell, it can smell you from miles away, and it is very, very fast. But it has a few weaknesses. Weakness number one... Enemy drones rely on their carrier to recharge. If they get cut off from their carrier, they will go to grounds to conserve energy. Finding this out is what saved Los Angeles. Weakness number two! These things are damned heavy! So, when they hover... Or they jump... They create a distinct seismic pattern, which we can detect from up to five miles away using these things! And we call them scan sticks. These will save your life. So use them, often! All right, let's go! Move it out! Well, I'll be damned. What the hell? Blake... He saved your asses. You're the only fighter team to figure that out on their first attempt, well done. You'll probably still die. But you'll die a Marine. - If I die in a gunman zone. - If I die in a gunman zone. - Box me up and ship me home. - Box me up and ship me home. - Pin my medals upon my chest. - Pin my medals upon my chest. Tell my momma I did my best. So, what's the story, Blake? You and Lieutenant Jackson knew each other before we came here, right? He's my brother? He's your brother. And you're only telling me this now? He's kind of a brother. What does that mean? Me real mom and dad died when I was 15. Truck hit 'em on the I-5, broke the car. My family was always close with the Jacksons so they took me in. Ever since his family's kind of been my family. That was until LA got hit. Now, it's just me and Chris. We're all that's left. You know, back in LA, I could barely keep my mouth shut. I could get juiced up about anything. Tossing a football, replacing a spar, fixing a cabinet. Now, I just keep seeing their faces right after they got out of the car. I fucked up, and now they're gone. It wasn't your fault, Blake. A lot of people died that day. There was nothing you could do. I guess that's why we're here though, right. So we can do something. Yeah, I hope so. My brother was a soldier too. You never mentioned your brother before. He was killed in Afghanistan a few years ago. Damn. I'm sorry. I was so angry when he joined up. My parents too. Couldn't understand why he did it. Then he died, and... It kind of changed things for me. I had to try and make sense of it all. Did you? Not really. But I'm starting to. It's not about fighting or winning, it's about protecting. What am I protecting? I've got nothing left. You got somethin' left, you got us. One two three four United States Marine Corp. One two three four United States Marine Corp. One two three four United States Marine Corp. One two three four United States Marine Corp. Down! Down! Wilcox! Move! Move! Blake! Blake! Get those scan sticks in the ground! This place is crawling with drones! Tell me somethin' I don't know! There's a ridge to the northeast where their numbers have thinned. We might be able to punch through. All right, you heard the man! Move out! Come on! Y'all try to get some sleep. We won't be down there for tonight. Go! Go! Load those motherfuckers! Move! Move! Move! Move! A grandeur! Come on, Lewis, come on! Go, go, go! I got this! This the fishing part of the mission brief? I must have missed that part. What's going on, Chris? Are we waiting for orders? It's good to see you too, Brother. I'm glad you survived. Can you hear it? Hear what? Waves on the beach. Wind in the trees. Call of the birds. The guns have stopped. Battle's over. What are you saying? We still have our objective. The mission hasn't changed. There are meant to be two platoons on this island. Now, there's just you, me, and these knuckleheads. It's not enough. There might be others. Scattered. Lost. Probably dead. So, do we give up? Just wait on the beach until the machines find us? They've left us alone so far. We're not a threat to them here. And how long do you think that's gonna last? And even if they do ignore us, what then? Sit on the beach and look at the water while the rest of the world fights! It's not on you to win the war, John. You don't have to keep fighting because of them. That's what you think this is about. I know I screwed up in LA. But the machines killed your family, not me! I'm here on this island because that's what needs to be done! I'm not gonna stop until it's finished. You can do whatever you want, brother, but don't fuck this up. We may not have much here, but it's ours. And we intend to keep it! To Wilcox and Miller. Wilcox and Miller. To Gleeson. I hope she gets better soon. Shark One won't be the same without her. Gleeson. I'm gonna need another round. I got this. - Evening, Corporal. - Major Atkins, sir. No need for that here, we're both off duty. I'm just here to make sure you boys behave yourselves. It's just a few drinks, sir. I think we're gonna turn in early. It's not you three I'm worried about. I guess we all gotta let off steam after Taiwan. You were LA born and raised, right Blake? Yeah. Have you ever traveled abroad? Does New Orleans count? I've been there a bunch of times. Yeah, New Orleans counts. How does it feel being so far from home? It feels like there's a lot of ocean between us and the Santa Monica pier. I'm afraid I'll never see my home again, sir. You're a smart man, Corporal Blake, you know what we're up against here. The enemy has built a wall between us and the West Coast in America. Until we can find a way to break it, we're stuck here, there's no goin' home. The 15th will need people like you and Lance Corporal Gleeson to keep it together. I want you to keep that in mind. Try to keep a clear head. Thank you, sir. I'll do my best. I know you will, Corporal. Sir, you can't come in. You're gonna have to leave. Fuck, I'm a god damn United States Marine! Shit, god damn Jackson. Please, sir, could you let me handle this? I understand that, but you're drunk, mate. Go ahead, just get him out of here. You bail at me through this, this won't go well for you. Trust me, I'll fuck you up! Hey, see! This guy's with me! Shark One Platoon, and we're the ones protecting - your country, asshole! - Come on, Chris. Let's skidaddy, come on, come on! Fuck 'em! Kids! I hope you're enjoying the end of the world! I bet you all raised your glasses, right? To the brave brothers of the 15th who gave their lives. I figured awhile back, it's quicker to drink straight from the bottle. We'd be here all night otherwise. To the 15th, MEU, and all the dead whose names I can't remember. You don't seem to be torn up about it. That's the advantage of having no hope. It's liberating, you should try it. So, you're just giving up? One minor setback, you're ready to surrender? Setback? We tried to take back Taiwan, and we lost the whole Southeast Asia. That's not a setback, it's a fucking catastrophe. And now the northeast is almost lost as well. The entire 13th MEU gone at Okinawa. 2,000 Marines dead. I mean, how do you replace an entire unit of 2,000 Marines? I knew some people from the 13th. My friends from bootcamp. There's no replacing them. Man, I didn't mean it like that. Look, the 15th will fight on. We're still strong. Not that strong. Pretty soon this place is gonna get hit too. We can't hold 'em off. We either bail out or we die. Don't know where we'll go if we do have to bail out. Maybe Antarctica? I don't wanna think like that. I can't. I get it, yeah, I get it. Better to die on your feet than live on your knees, right? Hmm, yeah, well tell that to the guy I saw getting his legs blown off in Fiji. We're fucked. Oh, where are you going? To visit a friend. Hey. Hey. You're awake. What the fuck? - Where am I? - In the hospital. We're in Sydney. Sydney? Shit! Hey, it's okay, hey, you're okay! It's okay, it's okay! She's okay, she just woke up. I'll organize you some breakfast. Try to relax, Miss. Hey, hey, look at me. Look at me! You're here now, we're safe, okay. See? Arms. Legs. All intact. You did real good. And we got promoted, both of us. - Really! - Yeah. They made you Lance Corporal for you know... Getting shot, I guess. That takes balls. What'd you get? I got Corporal. I don't know why, I only got a few cuts and bruises. No, you deserved it. You got us out of there. Not everyone. So, when do we ship out? I sail north with the Shark One Platoon in two weeks. We're deploying just outside of Darwin. But your mission is to get strong, Glees. And after that, if you want, you can stay right here in Australia. No... There's a marine base here, and they need all the smart people they can get. I talked to Jackson, he can get you a position there. They have computers and science, all that nerd stuff you like. No, I wanna go back! Just rest up. Think about it. We need these people ready for air transport in half an hour. - Can you make that happen? - Yes, of course. - What's going on? - They're here. Report to your superior immediately, Corporal. Blake, what's happening? They're gonna get you out. Don't worry, everything's gonna be fine. See you soon. Thinking of rejoining the fight? I intend to, sir. Can you believe I found this chicken just walkin' around? There's food everywhere here. Want some? Hutchins, you okay with all this? I don't know, man, Jackson's our CO. Yeah, but he's fuckin' nuts. Same as the rest of us. You should wear your uniform, Lewis, you're exposing yourself to the enemy. How's this for exposing myself? You see? Total disarray. No one listens to me anymore. Damn it's hot. So, was this the plan all along? Find yourself a nice tropical island? Go AWOL? It crossed my mind once or twice. I thought you of all people would understand. Once, maybe. Not now. You'll come around. Don't shoot! Dreyfus! God dammit! Is that chicken? It's good to see you, buddy. You too, Corporal Blake. So, what happened? Where'd you end up? We landed, I don't know, somewhere west of here. We lost Lieutenant Macey. He kept saying we had to reach the objective. I think he completely lost it. Gleeson kept it together though. She was always the smart one. Gleeson? Gleeson is alive? Last time I saw her. We got separated up at the ridge. Well... By that I mean I ran away. After she went ahead to scout the ridge, I scanned five drones heading my way. I had to get out of there. I should have stayed, shouldn't I? I just got scared, you know. I know we're not supposed to be scared, but I'm always scared. How'd you find your way back? Hey, you think we can go find her? I don't know. We got so close to the objective. There are drones everywhere. That's okay. You know why? Why? We got this. This is the machine killer. This is amazing. Where did you get it? From a dead alien. - What does it do? - I don't know. - Let's find out. - What, right now? Sure! Why not? You should be the one to test it. Keep it. Leave your backpack. We take rifles only. We travel light. Hey! Where are you going? We're going to find Gleeson. She might still be alive. I told you not to fuck this up, John. You go out there, you're not coming back. God dammit Chris. What ever happened to never leaving a marine behind? They left us all behind. Why can't you see that? You do whatever you want. I'm still a marine! Then you're a fool! Hey, Gleeson. Go. Get some rest. They're everywhere. They don't seem to care about us. It's nice here. Yeah. It's quiet. I heard about what happened up north. Yeah. It got pretty hairy for awhile. There's a mission coming up, an important one. I know you guys have been through a lot... I know. I heard about it. Jackson told you. You wanna go? Honestly, I'm scared. But yeah, yeah, I want to. Me too. I'm ready. I think we all are. I got your back, Glees. I know. Clear. - You said clear! - They were sleeping! Shoot the damn ray gun! Jesus Christ, it's me! Blake? Where have you been? You! Bastard! Where the hell did you go? There was five drones, I panicked. Shh, keep your voices down. All army of drones up that mountain. Let's go. Take cover! What the hell? I told you not to come back, Blake! Chris, what the fuck? Leave, or we'll be forced to take you down! Dude, your brother's gone completely sideways! Ugh! What should we do? Okay, so Jackson's at the rear, but they've put themselves in a narrow spot. We split 'em up, we can narrow the odds. Dreyfus, keep 'em occupied while Gleeson and I flank 'em. I'll draw Jackson away. You get the drop on the other three. Sound good? Yeah, I guess. What are you gonna do with Jackson? Let me worry about that. Ready? Ready. Okay. Cover me? Let's move! Lewis, what the fuck are we doing? I don't know, man, let's take a look. Hey! Guns on the ground both of you! Dreyfus! Hey! You wanna taste of this, huh? Yeah, that's what I thought! Hey, Chris! Stop! It's over, Chris! We're continuing the mission! You can't fix this, Blake. We can if we win. We can make it right. What's the point? I got nothin' left. We got each other. We're brothers. I'm not your brother, John. I never was. No! No! Get back! Get back! Go, go, go, go! Hey, snap out of it! You're in command! Okay! Run back to the river! Hutchins, Dreyfus, we're holdin' the rear. Go! No! Go, go! Go! Where's Hutchins? He didn't make it. Aw, shit. So, what now? There are gonna be drones swarming all around us any minute. I don't care how many drones there are. We finish the damn mission! Gleeson, you've seen this thing we're supposed to take out, right? Well, I haven't seen it, but I know it's there. It's heavily guarded, and we'll have to take down the barrier, so I can find a way inside. No, I'm taking the bomb. Blake... That's a thermonuclear devise on your back. Do you know how to use it? If it fucks up, do you know how to fix it? Right, so... I'll take it inside. You guys cover me, so that nothing shoots me in the back. We all knew this was coming. Fine. Think you could carry this? Guess I'll have to. Jesus Christ! We'll cover you from both sides. You take that thing straight up the center. Drop it on their lap. Seems simple enough. You two, you on board? You're gonna help us finish this. Do we have a choice? No, you don't. Let's move. Are you ready? Ready. We'll dock 'em nonetheless. Light 'em up. Now. Gleeson, take cover! So, we're breaking radio silence now? They know we're here. Keep 'em off Gleeson! Short bursts! Focus on the rear! Try to thin their numbers. You go that way, I'll go this way! We hit 'em on five! You're hit! Moving position to three! Lewis, Docker, what's your status? Fuck! Here take this! You know what to do! Dreyfus! I'm good. You gotta get clear. There's no point both of us going down. I'm not leaving. I'll make sure nothin' comes in after you. Okay, John. Thanks. Over. Gleason, there's more drones coming up! We're seriously fucked! Blake! You should go. I'm fine, we did it. Set the bomb now! Blake? You're breaking up. There are no words to express the gratitude felt by our nation for your contribution to the war, Sergeant Blake. We have it to you, and your fellow Marines of the 15th MEU have exposed key weaknesses in the enemy's military apparatus. The United States Armed Forces are now focusing on efforts on taking out these installations wherever we find them. Most importantly, you have given us hope again, Sergeant Blake. Your victory on New Britain has shown the world the enemy can be stopped, and the tide is finally turning this long and terrible war. I understand. We all do... What a great toll a fight like this has on a marine. I think I speak on behalf of everyone here when I say that you've earned a long break from active duty. On your return, we'd like to offer you a post in Pacific Fleet headquarters in Hawaii. I'm sure your first time experience of enemy technology will be highly valued there. Mai Tais and surfing. Not a bad ending for a tour of the South Pacific, right Sergeant? I wanna go back. I'm sorry? To the frontline. That's where I'm needed.
