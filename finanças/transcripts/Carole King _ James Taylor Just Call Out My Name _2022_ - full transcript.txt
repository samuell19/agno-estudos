Our next guests are two legendary Grammy award-winning singer/songwriters and member of the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, and tickets for their Troubadour Reunion Tour go on sale on Saturday ... please welcome to the program Carole King and James Taylor. [ Applause ] ♪♪ -♪ Lookin' out on the morning rain ♪ -James Taylor is a major force in music, one of the most popular and prolific songwriters of our time. -I think she's the best there is, Miss Carole King, ladies and gentlemen. -Carole King began her music career when she was just a teen, and by the early '70s she had reached the top of the charts around the world. -James Taylor, one of my all-time favorites. One of the most influential singer/songwriters of all time. -And now, Carole King and James Taylor are getting ready to tour together for the first time in 40 years. -It's a bit of history, tell us about the original Troubadour Reunion. -In November of 2007 James called me and said, "Let's get together and play with some of our old friends," and we had such a great time. -Like Carole said, it felt so good, we decided to take it on the road.

Mostly with Gerry Goffin, but with a couple of other people too. -In ... in all cases the music came through me, and when it was somebody else's lyric it integrated; when it was my own music and lyrics together sometimes it would just, all together, pop out of me. -I asked her to be a part of my band ... I ... I wanted her to play piano in my band. But of course, she was also this major musical source, that she'd written all of these amazing tunes, that some of which were my favorite songs, so I felt this thing that Carole really should be, you know, singing her own songs. -And you ... I remember you pushed me out on stage, and I was your side man, and that's all I ever wanted to be, and then you said to me, "I want you to go on stage tonight and sings your song." "Wha-wha-wha-wait! What? What? No! No! I can't do it!" "No, you're going to do it, no, don't worry," and you gave me the loveliest introduction, and you said that, "Okay, everybody, I'm gonna turn the stage over to Carole King, you all know her as a songwriter, she wrote blah-blah-blah-blah," and he listed the whole thing, and what he did was he made me pre-loved, because everybody knew all those songs. [ Applause ] I know that many of you are admirers of James Taylor. I am myself. I don't know, uh, if you know he's also really a fine guitarist as well as a fine songwriter and singer, and I'd like to try to get him out here to help me ... he was kind enough to volunteer, so, come on, James.

It had a proper stage and a backstage, and if you did well there, people ... people noticed it and, uh, the word got out. -The Troubadour was a community of people who wanted to hear that kind of music and the bands that chose to play there, and they were often interchangeable. But this little unit that we are right now is an essential core of the people that were there. -We've been trying to ... to, uh... recast our minds back and try to remember what ... what songs were in the, uh, in the set that we played together when Carole and I did the ... the Troubadour in ... back in 1903 or whenever.

In those times in the early '60s, when I was trying to learn the guitar, I met Danny on ... on Martha's Vineyard and, you know, right away, I started picking things up from him. -You have to remember at that point in time, there was a huge confluence of all kinds of music that were coming together, and for anyone that was even slightly interested in music, it was a brilliant time to be around. -I brought a small band together to make this first album, and we already had Danny Kortchmar, James's best friend, and also the person who had introduced me to James in the first place; I found a drummer called Russ Kunkel, whom I first heard play at a John Steward rehearsal. -And the way James accompanied himself on the guitar and sang, it was brand-new to me, I never heard anything like it. -And by this time we'd found the bass player of our dreams, Lee Sklar. -His songs were really amazing, his voice was amazing, and his demeanor was ... was unlike most cats I knew at that time. -And finally, I had met one of my idols, one of the greatest songwriters of all time, Carole King ... that was, by the way, Kootch who introduced me to Carole as well. I said to Carole, "About to make this record with James Taylor, and I wondered if you'd consider playing piano on it. Would you come over to my house and meet him?" So Carole said yes. -Next thing I know, I'm down at his house down in Hancock Park and hooking up and we're all talking about doing this show. -Which consequently changed my life, you know, for all intents and purposes. -I guess I didn't realize how exciting it was at the time, it is in retrospect that one looks back and says, "Wow, that was really exciting." We were just out here, doing what we did, being young, and, you know, making music. -It's kind of one of these things I wished I had been aware that my life was changing at that moment, because I might have absorbed it in a different way. It was one of those kind of moments where everything just goes "boom," and matches up, and we all, you know, just took off with them. ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ [ Cheering and applause ] ♪♪ ♪ Take to the highway won't you lend me your name ♪ ♪ Your way and my way seem to be one and the same ♪ ♪ Mama don't understand it ♪ ♪ She wants to know where I've been ♪ ♪ I'd have to be some kind of natural born fool ♪ ♪ To walk on the road again ♪ ♪ But you know I could feel it ♪ ♪♪ ♪ Walkin' on country road ♪ ♪♪ ♪ Sail on home to Jesus ♪ ♪ Won't you good girls and boys ♪ ♪ I'm all in pieces ♪ ♪ You can have my choice ♪ ♪ 'Cause I can see a heavenly band full of angels ♪ ♪ Comin' just to set me free ♪ ♪ No, I don't know nothing 'bout why or when ♪ ♪ But I can tell that it's bound to be ♪ ♪ Just because I could feel it ♪ ♪♪ ♪ Walkin' on country road ♪ ♪♪ ♪ Reckon my feet know where they want me to go ♪ ♪ Walking on a country road ♪ ♪♪ ♪ Walking on a country road ♪ ♪♪ ♪ So, take to the highway won't you lend me your name ♪ ♪ Your way and my way, they seem to be one and the same ♪ ♪ Baby, no ♪ ♪ Mama don't understand it ♪ ♪ She wants to know where the boy's been ♪ ♪ I'd have to be some kind of natural born fool ♪ ♪ To walk on the road again ♪ ♪ But you know I could feel it, feel it, feel it ♪ ♪ Feel it, feel it ♪ ♪ Walkin' on country road, walk on down ♪ ♪♪ ♪ Walk on down, walk on down, walk on down, walk on down ♪ ♪ Walk on down, and walk on down, and walk on down ♪ ♪ Walk on down, walk on down, and walk on down ♪ ♪ The country road, walk on ♪ [ Humming ] ♪ Walk on down with me ♪ ♪ So, oh, yeah ♪ ♪ Said every time I walk on the country road ♪ ♪ Get the same feeling from a get down [indistinct] ♪ ♪ I don't know where it comes ♪ ♪ Don't know where this thing goes ♪ ♪ Let's jump back and feel some more yeah ♪ ♪ Everything's fine and I'm walkin' ♪ ♪ I don't know how it happened to me today ♪ ♪ But every time I walk on the country road ♪ ♪ Just about the same thing goes down, oh ♪ ♪ Oh, I'm alright without it ♪ ♪ Every time I fight on out ♪ ♪ There's, oh, no doubt about it ♪ ♪ No, that's why I'm all about it ♪ ♪ I'm walkin' on country road ♪ ♪ Said I'm walkin' hand-in-hand with the one I love ♪ ♪ Won't ever, won't ever, won't now ♪ ♪♪ ♪ Well, you can feel it, put your hands on up ♪ ♪ Can feel it, put your hand on up ♪ ♪ If you can feel it, put your hand in my hand ♪ ♪ I said, walkin' on country road ♪ [ Cheering and applause ] ♪♪ [ Cheering and applause ] ♪♪ ♪♪ -♪ Now, Smackwater Jack ♪ ♪ He bought a shotgun ♪ ♪ 'Cause he was in the mood ♪ ♪ For a little confrontation ♪ ♪ He just let it all hang loose ♪ ♪ He didn't think about the noose ♪ ♪ He couldn't take no more abuse ♪ ♪ So he shot down the congregation ♪ ♪ You can't talk to a man ♪ ♪ With a shotgun in his hand ♪ -♪ Shotgun ♪ ♪♪ -♪ Now, Big Jim the chief ♪ ♪ Stood for law and order ♪ ♪ Yes, he did, y'all ♪ ♪ He called for the guard to come ♪ ♪ And surround the border ♪ ♪ Now, from his bulldog mouth ♪ ♪ As he led the posse south ♪ ♪ Came the cry, We got to ride ♪ ♪ To clean up the streets ♪ ♪ For our wives and our daughters ♪ ♪ Oh, no, no ♪ ♪ You can't talk to a man ♪ ♪ When he don't wanna understand ♪ Go get 'em, Danny. ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪ The account of the capture ♪ ♪ Wasn't in the papers ♪ ♪ Oh, no ♪ ♪ But you know they hanged ol' Smack ♪ Right then ♪ ♪ Instead of later ♪ ♪ You know, the people were quite pleased ♪ ♪ Because the outlaw had been seized ♪ ♪ And on the whole, it was a very good year, yeah ♪ ♪ For the undertaker ♪ ♪ You know, you know, you know, you can't talk to a man ♪ ♪ With a shotgun in his hand ♪ ♪ I said, a shotgun in his hand ♪ ♪ Smackwater Jack, he bought a shotgun ♪ ♪ Oh, Smackwater Jack, he bought a shotgun ♪ ♪ Oh, yes, he did, he bought a, he bought a shotgun ♪ ♪ Talkin' 'bout Smack, talkin' 'bout Jack ♪ ♪ Talkin' 'bout Smack and his shotgun ♪ ♪ Talkin' 'bout Smack, talkin' 'bout Jack ♪ ♪ Talkin' 'bout Smack and his shotgun ♪ ♪ Talkin' 'bout Smack, talkin' 'bout Jack ♪ ♪ Talkin' 'bout Smack and his shotgun ♪ ♪ Talkin' 'bout Smack, talkin' 'bout Jack ♪ ♪ Smackwater Jack, yeah ♪ [ Cheering and applause ] So, James, we got a problem. -We have a problem here, which is that we have an embarrassment of riches ... she ... she wrote too many good songs. -As did he.

So ... and as for this Troubadour Reunion Tour, as for working with James again, and the band, and it's... sheer joy, sheer pleasure, just, "Oh, you called me for this? Thank you!" -The thing that I think makes this ... this tour really unique is the fact that 40 years have passed since the first time we played, but everybody is still at the top of their game. If this was the last thing I did in my entire career, I'm good with that. -And the fact that they play and sing together and like each other and are genuinely great friends and musical collaborators, is unique. It's an event that you don't want to miss. -And even if we're not gonna be in the Troubadour, this is the most important thing we cannot lose, is that closeness that we feel on stage. We do it for each other, but what they're seeing is us having a great time together. -Our challenge was to figure out how to do an intimate show in a ... in a really large, uh, arena. -We wish everybody could be close in. Well, one way to do that is to perform in the round. -What we came up with was the idea that we ... we would basically have a club in an arena. We're also rotating slowly ... the stage rotates. Well, we've designed the show to be as ... as close and intimate as possible, and to play to everybody in the room.

When we first sat down together and basically went back and forth and we're hearing these things ... -We were thinking so alike at the time. And when I wrote "You've Got a Friend," i-it came through me, that song purely, purely came through me. I didn't have you specifically in mind, though it certainly applies ... has ... has applied since I know you. I didn't have anyone specifically in mind. I just sat down at a piano and that song just came out, just as you heard it, just as you do it, just came right now. -On the opening night at the Troubadour, it was that afternoon that Carole was doing her sound check, preparing for her first-ever solo show that night, just her and the piano on the stage, and she decided to run through a song she had just finished writing. And James and I were sitting in the balcony of the Troubadour, upstairs, and that's when we heard this brand-new song called "You've Got a Friend." -I'm not sure I was sold on ... on "You've Got a Friend," I-I mean, people say, "Did you know?" I didn't, I just thought it was a very nice song. I had no idea of the reach it would have. -As soon as I heard it, I said, man, that's just ... that's just it, that's a great, great song. -And James went crazy, he fell in love with the song, told Carole it was one of the best pop songs ever written and asked if she'd mind if he learned it. And he did, he learned the song from Carole, worked out his own version, and eventually we did ask Carole whether she would consider letting James record his version ... which I knew was against all the rules of show business, because she was about to make her own first record and it was clearly an amazingly good song. But Carole, with exceptional generosity and grace, said that would be fine, I'd be honored to have you record it as well. -When we play it together, the way your guitar blends with my piano part is just, it's like that first time we played together, it's that. -That's a good thing. -We did that, buddy! -A good thing. -We did that! ♪♪ ♪♪ -♪ When you're down and troubled ♪ ♪ And you need some lovin' care ♪ ♪ And nothin', oh, nothin' is goin' right ♪ ♪♪ ♪ Just close your eyes and think of me ♪ ♪ Yes, and soon I will be there ♪ ♪ To brighten up, oh, even your darkest night ♪ ♪♪ ♪ You just call out my name ♪ ♪ And you know wherever I am ♪ ♪ I'll come runnin' ♪ ♪ To see you again ♪ ♪♪ ♪ Winter, spring, summer or fall ♪ ♪ All you got to do is call on me ♪ ♪ And I'll be there ♪ ♪ Yeah, I'll be there ♪ ♪ You've got a friend ♪ ♪♪ ♪ If the sky up above you ♪ ♪ Should turn dark and full of clouds ♪ ♪ And that old north wind ♪ ♪ Should begin to blow ♪ ♪♪ ♪ Keep your head together ♪ ♪ And call my name out loud ♪ ♪ Soon you'll hear me knockin' on your door ♪ ♪♪ ♪ You just call out my name ♪ ♪ And you know wherever I am ♪ ♪ I'll come runnin' ♪ ♪ To see you again ♪ ♪♪ ♪ Winter, spring, summer or fall ♪ -♪ All you got to do is call me, call, oh ♪ ♪ And I'll be there, yes, I'll be there ♪ -♪ Now, ain't it good to know that you've got a friend ♪ ♪ When people can be so cold? ♪ -♪ They'll hurt you, yes, and desert you ♪ ♪ They'll take your soul if you let them ♪ ♪ Oh, but don't you let them ♪ ♪♪ ♪ You just call out my name ♪ ♪ And you know wherever I am ♪ ♪ I'll come runnin' ♪ -♪ As fast as I can ♪ ♪ To see you again ♪ ♪ Oh, yes, don't you know 'bout ♪ ♪ Winter, spring, summer or fall ♪ ♪ Darling, all you got to do is call, and, oh, no ♪ ♪ And I will be there, yes, I'll be there ♪ ♪ 'Cause you've got a friend ♪ ♪♪ -♪ You've got a friend ♪ -♪ You've got a friend in me, yeah ♪ -♪ You've got a friend in me ♪ -♪ Walkin' and talkin' friend ♪ -♪ You've got a friend in me ♪ -♪ Ain't it good to know, ain't it good to know ♪ ♪ Ain't it good to know, yeah, yeah, yeah ♪ ♪ You've got a friend ♪ [ Cheering and applause ] -At the heart of it, we have a conversation with each other and with the audience, you know, like, we just feel like we're there with one collective friend. -The connection with the audience is a ... is a very interesting thing. When people come to a concert and dedicate two or three hours to listening to a program of music, it still is a mystery why it works the way it does, but I ... I really love it and live for it, really. -What I ... I'm sensing people responding to is the simple presentation, the authentic friendship that we have. People are not really coming to see us as much as they're coming to see and hear that which we represent to the audience. I like knowing that, because that keeps our feet on the ground and it ... it isn't about us. We're the deliverer of that which they came to see. ♪♪ ♪ How sweet it is to be loved by you ♪ -♪ It's all right to get on up and shake that thing ♪ ♪ Come on ♪ ♪ How sweet it is to be loved by you ♪ ♪♪ ♪ I needed the shelter of someone's arms ♪ ♪ Darlin', there you were ♪ ♪ I needed someone to understand my ups and downs ♪ ♪ Baby, there you were ♪ ♪ With sweet love and devotion ♪ ♪ Now, yeah ♪ ♪ Deeply touching my emotion ♪ ♪ I just want to stop ... stop and thank you, baby ♪ ♪ I wanna stop to thank you baby, ♪ ♪ All right, how sweet it is to be loved by you ♪ ♪♪ ♪ How sweet it is to be loved by you ♪ ♪♪ ♪ Close my eyes at night ♪ ♪ Wondering where would I be without you in my life ♪ ♪ Everything I was into, it was just an old bore ♪ ♪ And everywhere I went it seems I've been here before ♪ ♪ But you brighten up for me all of my days ♪ ♪ With a love so sweet in so many ways ♪ ♪ I wanna stop ... stop and thank you, baby ♪ ♪ I wanna stop and thank you, baby ♪ ♪ Thank you, yeah ♪ ♪ How sweet it is to be loved by you ♪ ♪♪ ♪ How sweet it is to be loved by you ♪ Robbie Kondor. ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪ You were better to me than I was to myself ♪ ♪ For me, there's you, baby, I got no one else ♪ ♪ I wanted to stop, stop and thank you, baby ♪ ♪ I just wanna stop just to thank you, baby ♪ ♪ How sweet it is to be loved by you ♪ -♪ To be loved by you ♪ -♪ How sweet it is to be loved by you ♪ ♪♪ ♪ I said now, how sweet it is ♪ -♪ To be loved by you ♪ -♪ Make the old place ring one more time ♪ ♪ One last time ♪ ♪ How sweet it is ♪ -♪ To be loved by you ♪ -♪ Oh, strong and long, come on, y'all ♪ ♪ Yeah, now, now ♪ ♪ How sweet it is ♪ -♪ To be loved by you ♪ -♪ Only thing to give, long and strong ♪ ♪ Like you mean it ♪ ♪ How sweet it is ♪ -♪ To be loved by you ♪ ♪♪ ♪ How sweet it is to be loved by you ♪ -♪ To be loved by you ♪ -♪ How sweet it is ♪ ♪ Sweet it is ♪ ♪♪ ♪ And it feels all right, yeah ♪ ♪ Here in the Mellon, one last night, yeah ♪ ♪ Whoa ♪ ♪ Whoa-oh-oh ♪ ♪ Just!
