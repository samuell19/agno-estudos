Where is your crazy son? He's not crazy, he's just a loner. Patrick? Jesus, Patrick! Your mother! Hello? How did you get my number? Yes, I was in bed. That doesn't matter. I'm going to hang up, Ed. I'll hang up now. Excuse me, can you tell me where I can find the director please? Yes? - The candidate is here, doctor. I'm there right away. Your last application dates from three years back. Didn't you work as a nurse in the meantime? No, I stopped for some time when I married. And after you couldn't get a job in this country anymore? No. Can you work with a typewriter? Yes. Do you have children? - No. And is mister Jacquard back to work again? We are divorced. I get it. Why? I know it's none of my business miss Jacquard, but I'll be honest: We have no interest in housewives who don't know what they want. Why did you choose the Roget clinic, Miss Jacquard? The agency introduced me to the clinic. Because we're a small clinic, and because you thought we wouldn't be so demanding. No, I didn't think that! And because of these misconceptions, we select certain types. Types? Types of people, miss Jacquard. I don't understand...? - Lesbians, nymphomaniacs, sex maniacs. Are you shocked, Mrs. Jacquard? - No. Animal fuckers, necrophiliacs, pedophiles, exhibitionists, voyeurs... Do you understand me, Mrs. Jacquard? - Yes. God's illnesses are mysterious. Perversion is contagious in this clinic. Last week a woman like you sat here... Her perverse streak was that she hid her in the laundry room, then she smeared herself with her own feces. Is that shocking to you, Mrs. Jacquard? - No. It should shock you. It shocked me at least. I assure you that... Someone wants to see you. Come in, doctor! Mrs. Jacquard, Doctor Roget. Have my frogs arrived yet? - Not yet. Can you speed it up? - Yes. Mrs. Jacquard will be suitable for it, but has not yet worked in this country. Have you already worked with unconscious patients? Yes. And do you have experience with EEG brain monitors? Yes a bit. Doctor, her home situation is somewhat unstable. Hire her. Dr. Roget is the owner of the clinic, but I'm in charge here. I can fire you anytime without notice. I want to remind you, Mrs. Jacquard, that I am the one giving the orders here. The salary is minimal. The work schedule is demanding. And I can fire you without warning. Yes fine. - When can you start? Right now, if you want. Yes Mrs. Cassidy? Sister Jacquard, Sister Williams. Hey. Give her a uniform. She replaces the nurse in room 15. Room 15, Mrs. Cassidy? Correct. You take care of him. You will be responsible for the provision of intravenous therapy and other concerns. It's cold! It feels like a freezer here. Good to get a cold. Nurse Jacquard, this is nurse Panicale. Nurse Jacquard will be on duty from noon to 9PM. You can now return to your workshop. Thank you, Sister Williams. And this is our friend Patrick. He is a patient in need of permanent care. Why don't they close his eyes? Orders from Dr. Roget. His eyes must be kept clean and lubricated. Hi, Patrick. - He can't hear you, he's dead. Technically he is alive, he breathes, and his blood flows, but he will not speak since he has been unconscious for three years. What a waste. Yeah, a waste of space if you ask me. The first nurses also got Patrick. Patients who have survived a coma for three years can handle anything. Well, anyway, he's all yours now. He's co-operative. Well, I think Patrick and I will work well together... That often happens! Dr. Roget calls this a nervous reflex, but no one knows why he's doing it. It seems like he is doing it intentionally. No, Patrick does nothing intentionally. Is there a possibility for improvement? No. He's been unconscious for too long. Dr. Roget even says that if he regained his consciousness, he would have the intelligence of a microbe. But he knows how to spit. Head nurse Cassidy stays in the office until 8 o'clock. And Dr. Roget stays an hour later. Your shift ends at 9 PM. Do you have a question? No. I think I can handle it. Then I'll let you do it. Tell me, how was the patient's situation this afternoon? No change, doctor. - No change? Good. Are his clothes already changed? - Not yet. Please inform me if you are going to do that. Mrs. Jacquard, right? - Yes, doctor. Do you know he spits? What is your opinion, nurse? Good. I like him, doctor. Come on in, come in. Your frogs have arrived, doctor. Good. Just put them there. Did you see that? - No...? She doesn't like to come in here. Why? - Who knows that? If there is no oxygen, the flowers die. Didn't you notice? - No. Take a good look at him. As you can see, he's been in a coma for three years. He is in better shape now than when they brought him in. And yet he must be constantly monitored. In what state did you find him? Like a demon whose nature could not be tamed or turned back. What happened to him? Serious damage to the cerebral cortex. The police said it was an accident. Was the police involved? - Apparently. Would he have been shocked when he saw his mother die? Who told you that? Sister Williams. - Perhaps. I mean, what would have caused this? I am not interested in amateur psychology. I'm interested in how he's doing right now. Hold his leg, please. Do you know anything else, doctor? Captain Fraser says he and Patrick play chess. He also says that Patrick flies in and out the window when everyone is asleep. How can you be so sure he's not conscious? 176 pounds dead meat hanging from an unconscious brain? Can you imagine? Then why does he spit? Come on. I attached the needle to his skull, and now I destroy his brain cells, and continue down his spine. Give me your hand, please. He pays attention to the effect of the electric shocks... That's why Patrick spits. You see? Look, nurse. We're not going to cry for a simple frog, are we? They performed all the heart tests described in the medical journals. We tried monitoring him 24 hours a day using electroencephalography. There are records of his brain activity showing us that he has suffered a breakdown. He has been under observation for 1120 hours. And what do you think they registered? Only farts. - Why don't you let him die? He's already dead! It is only the machine that lives. Then why don't you turn them off? I think there are several reasons why we should do that. He has no family. Nobody visits him. He occupies a bed to which these expensive machines are connected 24 hours a day. But what is your personal opinion, doctor? I have a professional position, I don't need an opinion. I don't think that's a satisfying answer, Doctor. You shouldn't ask unsatisfying questions, sister. Do you really want to know why we keep this miserable being alive? Or why we spend thousands of dollars to keep two nurses at his bedside? Is there a reason? - Of course. Determining the exact moment of death is one of the most controversial things in modern science. What is the moment when what keeps us alive leaves our body? Do you mean the soul? Christians say soul, the Russians call it bio-plasma, and the Yogis call it the life force. But the question is what it is? Because it has never been identified. And why? Because death comes too early. The agony can be long, But the exact moment of death is an instant. Either you are still alive at that moment, or you are already dead. So Patrick is just a test subject for you? No, my dear, but he is a very rare opportunity to study the Grey area between life and death. What does Mrs. Cassidy think of your ideas? She thinks it is nonsense. Let me know when his bowels moved. What does he know anyway? I suppose you just have something to say, right? Hello? Is anybody in there? Hello? Are you finished, Ed? I want to discuss the divorce. Divorce? I thought our divorce was only temporary? What kind of divorce is this if you chase me everywhere? You just invade my apartment like you're a cheap thief. Do you think the lock will prevent anyone from entering here? Oh, Kathy! I want the best for you. I'm just trying to do something about it. Do you want to do something, Ed? Of course, Jacko. Whatever you want. Go away! I get it. Such a desperate fantasy about a woman being raped. I don't want to be involved. I want to be alone for a while. You feel hopeless huh. There is no point... Even if you get married one of these days... you will end up like Patrick. Ed accuses me of being ice cold. How can he know that? It is your body and your orgasm. And you decide how you feel. Are you going to the party on Friday? I do not feel like it. - That is no excuse. Brian's parties are always good. And Brian himself too. Who is he? Dr. Brian Wright. He's a neurologist. A perfect type if you love a playboy. I don't need galloping balls. That's okay. You have until Friday to decide. Okay, I'll think about it. Do you want to ride with me... ... or will you stay here with Brian? How so? - It is not without reason that he's called "Dr. Wright" (doctor right). You are drunk. It's a party. Relax a little. I don't feel like partying. I'd rather go home. Talking to him doesn't hurt. Life is short, Kathy. I want to talk about Patrick. Then talk to him about Patrick. He'll take care of the rest. Thanks. The keys are in the car. I'm going away for a weekend. Where were we? - Excuse me? Who are you? Kathy Jacquard. Where were you? I was listening to the music over there. I always give some rounds after a heavy night. I am Brian. I know, we already met. Come on, Kathy. I want to talk about a patient in the Roget clinic. Ah, you are that new nurse. Do you know Patrick? I once read an article about him. Are you going to swim or not? I just ate. Me too. Come on, with or without clothes. No, I have to go home. - I'll take you. I take a taxi, I am not allowed to drive. Nonsense! Let's go. - No. What are you doing? It's me. You said you could type with a typewriter, so that should save you a lot of work. The machine is not working. Just like the elevator and everything else in the clinic. Doctor Fraser thinks it's the fault of ghosts. What did you think of Brian? I couldn't go swimming with a full stomach. Done working? - No, Panicale is sick. Again? I see you tomorrow. Patrick, can you hear me? If you can hear me, I want you to do it again with your mouth. Once means YES, twice means NO. Understood? Does that mean YES? Do you know where you are? Do you know who I am? Can you see me? Do you feel this? I'll be right back. Mrs. Cassidy, I want to show you something in room 15. The director is here. Show her. Patrick, please show her. He spits... SECRET Brian. - Yes? Is it possible that the medical board has made a mistake? Yes, I would be the first to admit that. We generally only lose our time, don't we? I prefer to think positively that we help the sick and needy. I think it's a successful day when I don't make the situation worse for anyone here than it already is. I had many scientific ambitions to improve life for humanity. And now you only think about money? No, I'm rich enough. I think it's the parties, baby. I do not think so. Let's talk about you. I want to talk about Patrick. Also fine. These are the two hemispheres of the brain, divided into waves. Frontal, center and back. Each has 100 million nerve cells and fibers that send signals inside the brain. Understood? I learned that in my first year of school. That is the simplest part. We can see the connection in the brain that makes the patient bend his fingers, but when it comes to more complex matters, we have to resort to the suggestion. And what you are looking for is probably the most complex of all. The wafer-thin bridge between consciousness and unconsciousness. Are you talking about the soul? The life force? Are you sarcastic? I have another theory about this. Everything is possible. We have five senses. For example, if a man loses his sight, it is automatically compensated with hearing, or with the sense of touch. And Patrick lost all his senses. If there were a sixth sense, he would have developed it three years ago. What the hell is this...? Stay here. Hello? Please transfer me to the appropriate service, please. Who are you going to call? - The police. I prefer not to involve the police in this. Yes, wait a moment... Kathy, what's wrong? I don't want to involve the police. - You'd better do that. No. I don't understand you. Someone breaks into your house and you don't even want to report it? Indeed. - What do you mean? And what if he comes back? When he comes back, I'll beat him up. Don't fool yourself. Listen... I'm almost sure it was my husband. It's his way of drawing attention. I can handle it. Okay. I'll help you clean up. - No thank you. Kathy? - I told you it isn't necessary! I imagine, I'm already leaving. Sorry Brian, and thank you for your understanding. Tell me what if this hadn't happened...? ...never mind. Be careful. No, my lawyer advised me to discuss it with you. I thought you did it... How do you mean? I mean last night, Ed. You were very drunk, but did you remember? Remember what? Frankly, I am very disappointed in you. Kathy, I don't know what you're talking about. I said I didn't want to talk about it. What am I accused of? Ed, the apartment wasn't a palace, but it was mine. I painted and decorated it. I don't understand how you could be so cruel to do something like that. It was not me. I haven't even been near your apartment. Where were you? I don't want to see you again, Ed. Stay away from me or I'll call the police. Asshole! Sorry, Patrick. Sorry. You can feel it. Do you feel this? Do you feel this? Do you feel this? Do you feel this? Do you feel this? Do you feel this? Do you feel this? Yes, you do feel it, don't you? Come to me as soon as you have some time, sister... Do you believe in euthanasia, sister? Well, I don't believe in injections of death... Do you believe in the spiritual? The spiritual? Is it a good thing to give someone relief from pain? I don't believe anyone has the right to play God. What a pitiful response from a nurse. Should we close the clinic and just all go home? If God existed, he wouldn't let something like that happen to the patient in room 15. I would even dare say that God has a monstrous sense of humor. But there is no God, neither justice, neither condolences. There is only fear. And he just stays there, month after month, year after year... because no one here has the decency to shut down the machines and make happen what should have happened 3 years ago. It's a shame, sister. Patrick reminds us that those drugs cause more death than life. We just stick to this conspiracy, rather than get rid of our own evil. And then you appeared. That reminds us that he is human, that he has feelings, and that we have been negligent with him. And you as a nurse come up with something that our group of experts have not even thought of in three years. Not to mention the case that Dr. Roget and I in such a plight, have sought advice from an external doctor. And then you start touching our patient. That is asking for discharge from every hospital in this country. And you ask me, "Why don't you believe me?" I'm just trying to help. You can't do that. I'm not going to fire you. Frankly, I need nurses that are available. But you will be punished. Your punishment is to remain responsible for the patient in room 15. Because I want to prove that I made no mistake by hiring you. But I hope you do exactly what I say. Without excuse. I hope you keep your nose clean, your mouth closed, and your hands at home! Understood? Yes, Mrs. Cassidy. Now continue with your work. I changed the lock. I don't care what you think. I did not destroy everything. Someone has to take care of you. The painters are coming tomorrow. I take care of the rest of the furniture. I'm still going to clean the carpets. Believe me, Kathy, it wasn't me. You know, Ed, I had a terrible day. I'm happy to see you. What do I smell? Aah that smell. It is tuna stew. Not to estimate. I take care of everything. Ed Jacquard, chef and general handyman. Come on, sit down. Lift your feet up. And what can I bring you from the bar, ma'am? A gin tonic? Gin tonic please. Help me a little. What's wrong? - Nothing, doctor. It looked like you were crying. I have a cold. - What do you say? I said I have a bad cold. Oh, if it's only that. It's cold in here. If it's so cold in here, go get a heater from the director's office. I thought you would be used to it already. Sorry, doctor. Turn on the heater and sit in silence. Damn! And you call yourself a nurse! Go home, get in bed, and don't come back until you can work without breaking anything! I apologize for our endless discussions. What should we do now? I don't know myself; different things. Leave your home and live with me. It wasn't all your fault. But I was just locked up at home for 24 hours, between four walls, nothing to do. When you came home, you were drunk, you went to sleep immediately, and then you said it was my fault. Calm down, you're talking to the New Ed Jacquard now. That is all now a thing of the past. The whiskey goes into the sink. No more. And with the cigarettes too. What can I do to make you happy? A sports car? I buy a sports car for you, and then you have all the freedom you want. That means I can stay tonight? Let's eat, okay? - Good idea. Your friend Patrick... ...When he wakes up you will have to feed him with a spoon. Why do you say that? He is not a normal patient for standard nurses... Yes I know, but... Let's just forget about him. Cooked tuna à la Jacquard. Oh, get a coaster or you'll burn the table! I felt nothing when I lifted it? I still don't feel anything? What was the hospital's diagnosis? 2nd degree burns. He will not be able to work for several weeks. Hello, Mr. Wheatfield. Did you have a nice lunch? Everything alright? - Please. You're going back with him, right? I'm just going to cook for him one evening. And what about Brian? - Well, I don't know. I don't bother, but I know he likes you. Why didn't you give him a chance before returning to Ed? Well, then go back to Ed. He should really like you, and it's better not to be horny on your own. I'm not horny. You've been in front of Patrick for too long. Do you want good advice? Get out of here before you end like Mrs. Cassidy. What is wrong with you? Don't worry about him there... I'm worried about Patrick. Paula, he had an erection last night. That happens more, consciously or unconsciously. But this time was different. Well let it be. Hello Captain Fraser. Had a good lunch? - No different than usual. The elevator is broken again. Use the stairs. Does Ms. Cassidy know that this is a hospital, and not a gym? I have to remember this is a hospital? Do you think I'm crazy? The lift will be repaired as soon as possible. Mrs. Cassidy, do you have a moment for me, please? Wait a minute, I'm very busy, doctor. I want to hear all the details about what happened to Patrick. If that continues, we will have to ask the help of the police. I suggest you give priority to our elevator. What is that? - A brain monitor. Where does it come from? - I won him by playing cards. Do you have to tell me something, doctor? I want to test a new experiment. I'm going to treat Patrick with electric shocks and see how he responds to it. What do you think of that? Since you ask me the question; I find it disgusting. Yes, but it's worth a try. I'd like to, Brian, but I can't. The nurse is ill. I have to stay here all night. No, Thursday I am too busy. Well, I don't know yet. It's all a bit too hectic now. Brian, have you told anyone about our conversation with Patrick? Yes, but I don't want to talk about it over the phone. At least it is interesting. I will call you later. Promised. I have to go now, okay? Bye. Would you like to communicate? Hello? Is someone here? Ed burned his hands, but he didn't deserve any better because he's such a bastard. How's your boyfriend now? Patrick is waiting for his handjob. Ed is packed and hanged, and will drown in his own urine. Patrick, I didn't write that. It was you, wasn't it? Is it not? Show me, Patrick. Over there! Let me see! Patrick, show me! Let me see! I have all night, Patrick. Okay, I'll start for you. Let's start with: "Dearest mom" Is it your mama or mine? I never had a mother. She died when I was a baby. Come on, because you are the smartest here! What does that mean? Dearest Mom, Did you destroy my apartment? Why did you do that? What do you want? "Ed burned his hands, but the bastard deserved it." I did not write this! "When he lost his energy, I took control of him in the pool." What does that mean? Hey. Did I wake you? No no, come in. Had a bad night? - Yes. Is it someone I know? - Yes, Patrick. Let me help you. Are you free tonight? I don't know. Thanks, but I don't know. How was it? What are Patrick's progresses? If I counted them, I wouldn't even believe it myself. Why not? The principal didn't do it, and Dr. Roget would never do it. I'm not sure I can believe that. Possibly. What's it called when someone has the power to move things without touching them? Magic. You see! And you didn't believe me. I'm sorry. It's called telekinesis. Last night I was typing in his room... Yes? Continue. I was typing a letter, and I lost my concentration. Just like in a daydream. And when I came back, I saw that there was something else on my paper. Wait a second. I did not write this at all. I mean, it was my fingers typing, but I didn't write it, you see? I know it was Patrick. Patrick wrote that? Yes! Look: "When he lost his energy, I took control over his body in the pool." That's about you, Brian. You think? That he has spiritual powers? I didn't write this, it was Patrick. Take a look at this: "Ed burned his hands, but the bastard deserved it." The previous night my husband had burned himself on a cooking pot. And how can Patrick know all that? Hear, you say it yourself. How can he know that? Never mind, it was not wise to tell you. No, wait a minute, Kathy! You mean Patrick was in control of what you wrote? Yes. That's hard to believe. Do you think I wrote it unconsciously? Okay then. And what about the following? : I didn't even touch the machine. And I don't know anything about algebra. I couldn't even write that. What does that mean? Nothing. Kathy, I once saw a man floating... He was rising from his bed and hung in the air. I also once saw a Filipino doctor who removed a tumor with a bread knife. So don't accuse me of being stubborn. I have to get dressed for work now. It's very complex, Kathy. I don't want to give an opinion before first examining Patrick... And unfortunately they don't allow me for professional reasons. It's not fair. But it is ethical. Sister Jacquard. Director Cassidy wants to speak to you urgently. You wanted to speak to me, Mrs. Cassidy? Remember when I said I can fire you without warning? Yes? I'm sorry, but now the time has come for me to do that. Grab your belongings and leave the clinic immediately. Why? I never told you the job was going to be permanent. Did I do something wrong? I'll be honest, Mrs. Jacquard. You are not made for this type of institution. It's Patrick, isn't it? Because I'm starting to understand him. No, I wouldn't say that, you don't know much about him. The texts you type are completely incomprehensible. My texts...? It's because Dr. Wright asked for permission to examine Patrick, right? I don't want to talk about it. I've had a busy day. You can't make that now. - Of course I can make that. Can you please leave the room now? What have they done to you? I have to tell you something, Patrick: I got fired. I am gone. Do you mind? It's not possible to stay. I have no other option. "HELP ME" How can I help you if you don't cooperate? What are you afraid of? Because no one should know? "WANT TO KILL ME" Who? When? "TONIGHT" I'm going home. Good night nurse. Has anyone left earlier in the day? Not that I know. Why? Just because I heard sounds in the basement. Maybe it was just the ghosts, as Captain Fraser would say. Kathy, this is ridiculous. - Then don't participate. Is it against the rules to save a life? Shut up about it. Attention! He's in the wall. He's in the wall. Captain Fraser, why are you awake again? Captain... When you need something at night, just ring the bell. Come with me. Time to change. What a disaster. Patrick, this is Dr. Wright. The one I told you about. He will help you soon. How long will it take? Talk to him. - Why? To see if he answers you. Please Patrick, in the name of God. Did you say he had an erection? - Yes. Go ahead, Kathy. We don't have all night. Well, let's try something else. Let's see how he responds to the strobe. Is it taking a long time? It was your idea huh. No, but hurry up a bit. Hold this an inch from his nose, and gradually increase the speed. Watch now. Hello? Hello, Paula. Well, that was not my intention. No. I got fired yesterday. What is it? What happened? Yes of course. I'll be there in half an hour. Doctor, I made a report and have to follow the instructions of the police. Yes? Mrs. Jacquard. - Good. Send her in. Sit down, Mrs. Jacquard. Doctor, what I'm trying to explain to you is that... the electricity was interrupted for about an hour. All clocks and lights in the building have failed. We have an emergency generator in the basement that switches on automatically when there is no light. The interruption lasted only two minutes. I get it, but the energy company claims that the overload came from here, from inside this building. Do you have any idea what could have been the cause? No, but I know the cables are overloading themselves. You're Mrs. Jacquard, right? - Yes. Are you responsible for the patient in room 15 between noon and 9pm? Yes, normally. But you weren't here in the clinic last night? Mrs. Jacquard? No, they fired me yesterday. That is new information to me. Director Cassidy is of course responsible for the staff. What happened here last night? Sister Panicale was found unconscious in room 15 in the morning. It says she was hysterical. Was she hysterical doctor? Yes, or so it seemed. Is she okay now? She uses sedatives. Heavy sedatives! As you can see, it will take a while before we know what happened, and since you were working in room 15, we hope that... Sergeant. Nurse Panicale almost had a nervous breakdown. She was weak and vulnerable. She could come up with any excuse to be sick. In my opinion, she should have panicked when the lights went out. There is probably a logical explanation for what happened, but we received dozens of calls. Not only to report the power failure, but also about howling dogs, and even flying saucers. Sergeant Grant? - Yes what is it? There is something in the basement that you should see. Can that wait a minute? - I don't think so, sir. Doctor, it's Patrick. You know that, don't you? There is the cause of your short circuit. It's not a beautiful way to die. If you come in contact with this terminal, you will suffer from internal bleeding and burns. Who is she? The director: Mrs. Cassidy. I need an official report, doctor. Not too formal. Doctor? Why do you think she came here? I suppose she came to turn something off, but I'm not sure. What are you going to do now? Let's open an investigation for clarification. Do you believe it was an accident? The electricity company says it is. She was barefoot in a pool of water in the cabin. Why was she barefoot? And what did she do there? Listen, Jacquard. I suggest we don't complicate the situation, huh, please? Let's base ourselves on the report. Please listen, Mrs. Cassidy wanted to see Patrick dead. And now she's dead. Does that sound like an accident? Let's be honest, Mrs. Jacquard. You mean she wanted to kill the patient in room 15? I definitely think that would be possible yes. - Why? That's a difficult question to ask, but there is someone who can explain it better than I do, and I think you should talk to him. Kathy? - Brian... Sergeant Grant, this is Dr. Brian Wright. Sorry to disturb you. - What's the problem? Something happened. Mrs. Cassidy is dead. She is electrocuted. Sorry for your loss. Sergeant Grant is investigating the case. That's what she says, but... Brian, she wanted to turn off the power, and then she was killed. We are not sure about that. - But he doesn't understand it; Patrick was right. She wanted to kill him at night, and he stopped her! Who stopped her? - Patrick. The one that's been in a coma for two years? Three years. Brian can explain it better than me. But I don't know it myself either. Brian, I know it sounds weird, but Mrs. Cassidy was killed. And how can I help with this? Tell him about psychokinesis! Kathy, I can talk about psychokinesis for four hours, but what does that have to do with Mrs. Cassidy's passing? Brian, he'll think I'm crazy if you don't say anything. Tell him about what happened at the pool. When did I get that cramp in the water? You didn't have a cramp, and you know that, Brian! It was Patrick! That Patrick seems to escape often. Kathy, sweetheart... - Don't make fun of me now, please. I think you should tell him what happened last night. That is a matter for the police. Do you want me to tell? Mrs. Jacquard... Tell him, Brian! Mrs. Jacquard, will you wait in the car, please? Mrs. Jacquard? Tell me about last night, doctor. You're not really interested in my sex life, do you, Sergeant? I still feel like I need to do something else. You could close the door when you leave. Are you going back to Ed? - I don't know. I'd give it a try. Yes. Thanks, Paula. Thanks for everything. Ed? Phil, I'm looking for Ed. Have you seen him? No. He has two days off from work. I had not thought of that. I'll find out. And Phil, if you had to see him... Yes I know. Okay. Hear you later. Tavern "The Butler"? Who? - Jacquard. Ed Jacquard. No, I haven't seen Ed in a few days. Don't you think he could be in that woman's house? Ah yes. Did he mention her name? It's very important that I speak to him. Undoubtedly Neil Adler knows more about this. Neil would provide a sports car for Ed... A sports car? Yes, as a surprise. Oh, I get it. Now it's clear. I think I know who that girl is. Do you have the number of Neil Adler? Yes, I'll wait a while. Thank you. Why don't you quit and go home? Go home? - I'll arrange everything further. Doctor... - Don't argue, I'm still in charge here. Please go home and don't worry about it. Hello? Is it Neil Adler? I'm looking for Ed Jacquard. I was told he would see you because of a car. I'm his wife, Kathy. Sergeant Grant. How can I help you, Mrs. Jacquard? Sergeant, I have a problem. And you are the police officer among us. Lucky me! What is your problem? Well, it seems I lost my husband. I get it. However, it's not as crazy as it sounds: He recently bought a car from a friend, and that was actually a gift for me. And it looks like he's gone now. Help! Hello? - It's Sergeant Grant. We found the car. But no sign of your husband. - Where was the vehicle? Parked at a forbidden place in front of Dr. Roget's clinic. Apparently he had been there for a while. Are you still there? - Yes, sergeant. By the way, did you know that your friend Patrick is no stranger to us? How do you mean? When I look at the logbook, I notice... Just a moment... there's a pencil note from the friend of a nurse who worked here a year ago. And what's wrong with him? He died of an unknown illness. It says it started with an overall numbness, and the doctors can't find a logical explanation for it. Is something wrong? Mrs. Jacquard? Ed's all boxed in and hung up. He made me do this. We have to kill him and you're going to help me. We vacate the building and burn everything. You can't go in there! He will not allow it! No! No! What did you do to my husband? Patrick? Where is he? Tell me, Patrick! GET STUFFED SLUT! Ah! Is it like this? Do you think I'm a slut? Why? Because I was unfaithful? Because I don't belong to you? Is that why you killed your mother, Patrick? What did you think, Patrick? If you avoid other men coming near me, we would we be together forever? I love you. Love? What do you know about love? Who will love you? You are self-centered, selfish, and not very indulgent, just like a little child who needs his mom. Continue. Go ahead. It doesn't frighten me. What did you do to my husband? POETIC JUSTICE. BOXED IN. HUNG UP. STEWING. Where is he? DO YOU LOVE HIM? BETTER OFF WITHOUT THOSE WHO HURT YOU. You're wrong, Patrick. Are you better then? ONLY YOU CAN SAVE HIM. What? ON THE FLOOR BENEATH THE BED. What is that? POTASSIUM CHLORIDE. FAST. NO PAIN. I don't understand, Patrick. TIME IS RUNNING OUT... EDWARD OR PATRICK. DECIDE. What did Ed do wrong to hurt him? And what did I do to hurt you? DECIDE. I can't, Patrick. YET EACH MAN KILLS THE THING HE LOVES. BY EACH LET THIS BE HEARD. SOME DO IT WITH A BITTER LOOK. SOME WITH A FLATTERING WORD. THE COWARD DOES IT WITH A KISS, THE BRAVE MAN WITH A SWORD. I'M GOING NOW. I LOVE YOU. COME WITH ME. Get out of there. The hour of darkness is approaching. Who are you? Ed Jacquard. What is going on? Kathy is in there with Patrick. Patrick? Kathy? Kathy? He is dead. I know that too well. I killed him. Nobody killed him. He died of natural causes. Come on, honey, I'll take you home. Don't be afraid. It was just a nervous reflex. I've experienced this before. Some say that is the life force. The soul leaves the body. Whatever it is, it was the end. So. This was Patrick. He was Patrick. Translated & synced by Crypto86.
