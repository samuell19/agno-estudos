If it's helping as much as possible of them to go, then I will be tolling the bell till the Judgement Day. I've tolled for my Creator. Come on, Tomo, pull it a bit you too. Tomo! There he is. Rough. They blocked the city. I've been searching for you everywhere. I have connections in Kamenovo, they will transfer you over, before the night. Everything will be all right. Let's go! The only thing left is to get rid of those wreaths I will burn them with cyanogen, that's the safest. Take it, Payo. Everything went smoothly, so far. Should we shoot? Wait, we'll see what he wants. Where to? Upward... In the woods? Yes. I thought so. Give the documents, drivers licence. Come on, come on, give it! Come on, you! Get out! You don't think that I'll crawl in back. Stipe, bring him over here. Here we come, Mr Sergeant! You should transfer us to the city. We work at the construction area. It's far, the boss will be angry. I'll give you the absence note. Come on! Hurry up! Hurry up! Come on! Come on, what are you waiting for? Is it over, back there? It's over! All good! Let's go. Tell me, who is he? A fool. What did he do? Shot at policemen. What will you do with him? Leave that! My uncle died. A Colonel. Stop! Stop! Let's go. He had the list of suspects. Take it. What's your name? Klir. I'm Tomo. Come on! Come on, mount! It's OK. It's OK. Good. We're staying here till Pero at Radishte set connection, see you then. If we don't hear from you erarlier, we'll come according to the deal. Where will we meet? Listen, up there at Kamenovo borough, there is a pub. I'll be in front of it, beside the truck. Good bye. Good bye. Wait here. Pero! What is it? What do you want? What is it? - Petar is missing. - How come? Chauffeur hasn't seen him this morning. Yesterday either. Devil with him, he's always on time. You know him. Attention! Someone is watching through the window. It's nothing. Just seemed to me. You think so? Boy! Here you are! Just a moment. They go to town every Saturday, to have fun. You won't go with them? I asked you... I haven't asked you anything. Maria, where is your boy? He went to fetch the water. He should get a spanking. Boy! Boy! I'll go to look around. But don't forget about the warrant. Thunder doesn't strike a nettle. We are 100 kilometres far from Pozega. - Why don't you respond when I call you? - Huh? Do you understand me? Did you understand what I told you? Yes I have. Then say, I understand! I understand! I'm not a soldier! Where are you going? In the basement, to get wine. I will. Did you hear me, boy? I did! Did you understand boy? I did! Are you here boy? I am. Are you there boy? I am. Like I am really a child that needs diapers. What's up with goulash? Here you are. Enough! All right. Pay. I don't like anyone standing behind my back. If one doesn't hear well, clean up your ears. Do I need to talk loud? What would you like? One brandy. Maria, one brandy here. Bucket, boy! Faster, boy! Here you are. Have you billed it? I will now. What are you waiting for? Do you want me to run after him, later? He is not very polite toward guests. Many people drink and don't pay, you know how it is... No one has written on their face, who and what they are. That's not true. How? Like so. Everything is written on your face. Good as bread, when she's good, hot as pepper when she's angry, but pretty as picture, always. What is it? What do you need? Nothing, just asking who is the boss here. For a job, or... Yes, for a job. It's me, for a job. So what? So nothing. Is there a job? Do you have papers? Of course I have. Work permit? All. You can work on timber harvest. Lodging, food and 200 per day. Saw and axe, you are buying from me. Is that ok? It's ok. Do we write right away? Well, we can do that tomorrow, as well. Huh? We can. Damn it, where did I see him? Twenty one. He is cheating. Repeat. Repeat. You cheat! He didn't make it to burn the wrenches. That means... Someone is coming! Get out. Get out when I tell you! Really? Why? What is it? What's funny? What is it? If you're pulling the gun, be sure it's not in vain. People won't understand why do you carry it. Has any message arrived for me? I think not. Maria, has any message arrived for Mr Lisac? No. The second day that I'm waiting for it. I need... Let Zuti bring me some hot water, I want to shave. Hey bro! Huh? Looking for someone? Nah! Zuti, take the water upstairs! It somehow seems to me I've seen him before, somewhere. Who? The one just asked for a job. I don't know. I don't care. What is it? If you'll take my advice, I would flee from here as soon as possible. We should wait for Petar. What if he doesn't come? Then we'll have to find out what happened with him. Did anyone new come? I don't know... I think not. Did anyone leave? Well... What's up? I'm not waiting for anyone any more. Whoever wants to town, pack yourself! Come on! Let's go! I'm coming... Right away. Today, at the extraordinary court-martial in Osiek a hearing occurred, against Zlatko Novak, who attacked, with three other participants a German soldier unit with bombs. In that incident, several Wehrmacht soldiers were wounded. Fore-mentioned, Zlatko Novak was sentenced to death by firing squad, and for the other participants warrants have been issued. Seem you are joking with me? I tell you loud and clear what to do and you, like that... You don't care! Goes in one ear and out the other. I haven't seen... You haven't? Clearly, you haven't seen! The whole day you stare at cards and drink with that gang downstairs! They don't know to respect, do all so they despise you. When they expect you to show them teeth, smile. You think they will smile? I told you. Is that clear?! At your command! Come on... Go, watch, listen and memorize. Consider everyone an enemy, till proven otherwise. There is increasingly more of those who don't wish us well. You've seen wreaths in the truck? I have. Those are the things you have to think about. Prepare now a stake for Lisac, no onion. What did you say? Prepare a stake for Lisac, no onion! Haa... I've had enough of shouting. I've been listening to the news. They captured some guy who shot at Fritz. Others fled. Don't worry, they won't get far. Hah, you never know. They issued warrants after them. What do you say? Warrants! Come on, mount! Hurry up! Come on! Let's go! Where is that from here? - What? - From here! That paper? The legal document brought by Mr. Lisac yesterday when he arrived. Who took it? - Ha? - Maybe I did. This morning I was tidying up the drawers, and washing windows so I needed some parer. What was it? Something important? It's nothing. Back to work. Zuti! Come here. Leave that. Go get Lisac, tell him it's urgent. The truck left. Petar is not with them? No. I'll go ask the boss about him. He knows something for sure. - Not there, it's dangerous! - Who to be afraid from? The fat boss? - And the young skinny Ustasha? - Just a kid. I'll go with you! Better stay with him. Stay here. Hey! You! What is it? Boss sent me. He needs you something about the job. Just perfect. I need him too. Where is the boss? He is here... Flee! Calm down! Stop! - What is it? - Why are you laughing? What is it? Are you being cocky? I'm waiting. Why? I don't know what I've done. Calm down! What is he doing for so long? Boy! Yes? Come on boy, search him. I? Come on, come on! Don't be afraid! What are you waiting for, boy? Hands up! Come on, boy. He won't bite you! A gun. Come on, give it to me! Look out! Stop! Hold him, Zuti! See if has he anything else. There's nothing else. - Go ahead. - Come on! Come on! Hands up! Up even more. I won't your fingers to touch the ceiling. Come on! Tomo Oliachic... Unbelievable! Evildoer came back, ha? I think it would pay you up more if you let me go off here. Oh hoh! And if I don't let you go, what would happen then? Huh? Then you'll live out. You don't say? Like you are the first one for me! Huh, Zuti? Like he is the first one for us! But Zvonimir Lisac is still alive. Very much alive. Temporarily. What do you say? I say it's just temporarily that you're alive. My men will... Shut up! Do you want me to put the legs in your head? Leave him to me. Let him talk! Continue Mr. Oliachic. I'm listening. Just wanted to say, my men won't leave me stranded. They will come here and release me, and you... they will kill you. And? That's all? All. Listen, leave that story for later, when we arrive at the police. They will be more interested. Especially that, about you men. Bring that chauffeur from the basement. Let's go! Come on! - Chauffeur can't go on. - Why can't he? Like so... He can't stand on his feet any more, let alone to drive. Zuti did him over. Didn't I tell you to be more patient, damn you! What now? Does anyone else know to drive a truck? You see now! We'll go to go by foot now because of you! Well, it would be best to leave that for tomorrow. It's far... and we will be caught by night in the woods, it's not convenient... Out of question! He must be at the police tonight. They wait for him impatiently. Indeed. Pity to leave that much money laying around. As much as I know, there is a reward issued for me. 150.000. Alive. 75.000 if dead. That's not to throw away either. Right? That's not a small amount. Go get the rifle. Boy! Do you know to handle this? - I know. - Take it! - Why? - Take it! That's for the behoof and safety of The Independent State of Croatia. You'll go with us to town. A gangster like that should be watched over with ten pairs of eyes. And you? Would you too come with us as well? I didn't hear what you said? I didn't say anything. Waiting for dinner. Oh, the dinner. That means you refuse? Huh? How much you said you'll pay? Pay what? That's patriotic duty and you don't charge for patriotism. What about reward? That's something else. Later about that. I would rather talk about that now. Escorting him, that's the same as sitting at the empty table. What is it, boss? Ok. Is 5 enough? Ten? We share equally. Well then, it's fine, give him the rifle. Wait. Tell me, how good of a shooter are you? Good. Here you are. And this one is for him. If you are a good shooter... - Listen! - Huh? Should I go inside to see what is he doing for so long? If he told us to wait, then we will wait a bit longer. Come on! Come on! Let's go. Ready! What is it? Nothing. Ready! So, you want to go with us, too? Ha? Oh man... anyways, you can come. You know where to? Yes. At your command! Well... Mr. Oliachic, here you go! If I only knew what is he doing. Faster! Faster! Maria... lock good and let no one in. Did you understand? Jesus Christ! Where are you going! Stop! Are you stupid? Stop! If you can fire a bullet, you'll hit Tomo. If you hit someone else, they'll kill him right away. Wait! Ok, you say well... Come this way! Infamous Tomo Oliachic, I imagined him differently. Ah, well... the stories about bandits and werewolves have always excited the imagination He disappointed me too. You didn't disappoint me. Never heard about you before. And if I did, I'd imagine you exactly the way you are. Have you seen that? Saucebox! Come on! - Why did you stop? - I hear something. Don't move! I warned you! What? I told you, my men won't leave me stranded. I said, I don't care about bandits' warnings. Move on! The closer to him, the safer we are. They won't dare to shoot at him. Come on! Move on! I wouldn't advise you to go any further. Behind any rock peeks a gun barrel. Look! I don't see anything. I told you, don't listen to him. Let's go! I'll shoot! Step back! Help! Tomo Oliachic, forward! The rest of you, halt! Come on! People, they will kill us all! We will count to 5! If you don't release Tomo, we will shoot at you! We are besieged. - We should release him! - Calm down! One... Two... Three! Four! Lisac, they are not joking! Wait! So help me God, I'll kill him if you shoot another bullet! Don't believe him! He won't dare! Look, they are not shooting! They are afraid for him! Let's retreat! See, they don't shoot any more. Come on! Maria! Hide yourself. They didn't flee. They are preparing something! I see nothing! They must've fled! Ha? They have no guts. Shoot them! God damn you! Release him! Release him! Do you hear me! Zuti, look out! What do you want?! Release Tomo! You won't come out alive! Get out! How many of you are there? Try to count them out! If you don't have enough of fingers, I'll help you. But before that, you must untie me. Stay in your place! Why us?! Just one step... Tomo! Tomo! Tomo! I'll give you runaway, damn you, bandit! Tomo! I asked you... how many of you are there? Guess. How many? Many. What does he imagine where he is? Tomo! Tomo! They'll kill us all. Shut up! Tomo come out! There is two of them. Tomo! Let Tomo speak! There is only two of them out there. Let him answer them. Come on! Answer them! Come on! Answer them! Payo! Do you hear me? Is everything all right? What shoul I say? Order them to come here. Payo! Listen! I order you... to block all exits so no one can get out! When others arrive tonight, you know already what to do! I know, I know, Tomo! If anyone just touch you, there will be hell to pay. Tell them that! Zuti! How far is it... Go over there! How far is to the bunker on Labudovac? An hour and a half, at most, if I go across... Excellent! They have a car over there. That means, you can be back in two hours with the whole Brchko. How will I go out? There is only two of them. You will get through. Pay attention, when you get to the road, you'll alert me with three shots. You must be here with Ustashas before his men arrive. I understand. Should I go? Wait. Something else should be prepared. Come. We should wait the night. Huh? Not sure what to do. Tomo is leading them on to buy some time. That's obvious! But... Gangsters! - I'll fire back at him! - Wait! What do you want? You can shoot now as much as you want! Stop it! Just be careful not to hit the window, because your Tomo is behind it! Do you hear that? They put Tomo behind the window so we wouldn't shoot! Look out over there! That's Zuti! After him! Payo! Payo! Payo! He ran away! Zuti. He succeeded. If someone should be worried what will happen, it is you. And yours outside. - Let me see. - It's nothing. It scratched me. I left schmeisser. Leave it. It's empty, anyway. 1,2,3,4, 5,6,7,8,9. And now... everything should be barricaded, so even a mouse couldn't enter. Soon we will have, a bunch of Ustashas breathing down our neck. With 9 bullets... We should enter the house. Through the attic? Or through the basement. It's fine. Now they can shoot. Huh? Bring the radio, Mile. This should be celebrated. Excellent! That's it! Excellent! Turn it up a bit, so it's jolly to those outside, too. Can't be louder, batteries are weak already. Is that so? Can I get just a bit of water? Water? No, you can't. Hey! Where to? To give him water. He asked. I said, he can't. Just water. He didn't ask for the holy Sacrament. He changed his mind. He is not thirsty any more. Ask him. Look her face. Near tears. Tell me you're not sorry for him. Huh? It is. I feel sorry for him. Would you feel sorry if he arrested me? It wouldn't. - Not even a bit? - Not even a bit. Enough, Maria! I don't like that. No! Enough! What is it? Nothing. He is a human. Who says that? Who says that? I do. I don't like when someone meddles in my affairs. I don't like especially when interlopers meddle in my affairs. As much as I can remember, we concluded this business jointly. Am I right? What does that mean? That means, he should be given to eat and drink so he could stay alive, to hand him over alive. For such, it's written, 150.000. Double the amount as, if dead. That's all. Jesus. Come on! I'm coming. Boy! Go upstrairs to Maria, tell her to come here. I want her in front of my eyes. Go yourself. Do you want me to slap you? Jump! Maria! Boss ordered you to come down. I won't. You're guilty. I won't! It's not my fault. Boss says... If he tells you to kill, you'd kill? Is that because the one in the basement? What could I've done? Lisac took out revolver. No need to tell you twice. I didn't know... I wasn't thinking! You don't know everything. That noise, they were beating Petar, Pero, the chauffeur! There he is, lying in the basement, half-dead from beating. Run away! Return home. And you? What will happen with you? I will go somewhere, as well. Maria! If you would only want... I've been thinking about that already If you only knew how nice it is at my home. Everything is plane flat. Flat. You are still a child. I'm not a child. Come on! Slowly! Listen! The basement window should be here. Go around me! But quietly so they don't hear us. Boy! Boy! Where are you? You don't hear when I'm calling? I hear. What's up with Maria? Huh? What do I know what's up with her! How you dare talking to me like that! Well, I talk at my will. You will, to me... You! Don't boss! Don't! Don't boss! Don't! No more please! Don't! I'll kill you! What are you saying?! I'll kill you, boss! Don't move! - Look at the cockerel. - Do not move, Lisac! Boy! Leave the rifle! - Boy, I... - Quiet! Leave it! No one moves. Calm down. You think you will make me a murder? I'm leaving! You know very well that you can't. I'm going! Don't be foolish, boy! Don't be foolish! - Come on. - I will! Go, don't be afraid! Just slowly torward the door. That's it. Don't listen to him. He's persuading you to go in front of their barrels. Move the table. Don't turn around! With leg! With leg move the table! Payo! Don't shoot! Now, open the door. That's it. That's it. Slowly. Slowly! Slowly. Now the other one! Pull the latch of the other one. That's it. Slowly. Be careful, boy! That was a boy. A boy, my eye! Deserter! I shot him in accordance with Poglavnik's decree from the 10th of September, this year. Murderer. Nothingness! I'll fuck you up now, dam you! Fool! What a fool! Huh? Marko! Give me a mirror. Better don't look yourself in the mirror, Lisac. It will be courageous to carry a face like that. You started to mock early. I'll disfigure you, so even your mother won't recognize you any more. Put the gun down, slowly! The rest of you, too. No one moves. You're always opposing something. I am. Against what? Against you. Against Poglavnik. Against Poglavnik's decree. Against The Independent State. And against everyone similar to you. Is that enough for you? Is that so? Since when? Since I know about myself. And if you're really interested, since the moment I became a partisan. Since I was sent to find Tomo Oliachic. Since you caught Pero, the chauffeur, so he didn't have time to acquaint me with him. You are crazy! You're crazy, not brave. The man with one bullet in barrel, can't be that. With one bullet. I give it back. Give back the gun, too. You don't need it empty. Are you sure? If you're sure, move. Take a rod. Through the gate. You can eliminate one of us. The enjoyment will be over with that. To eject cartridge cases, and insert another bullet to the barrel, you need two seconds. Enough for you to get killed. Maria! Move the gun. Ok, tell me now, why didn't you shoot earlier? Whit what, my friend? I had only one bullet. Not enough for the two of them. Come on! Hurry up! Zuti can arrive any minute, with Ustashas. Come on, let's move. - Listen Tomo... - What is it? Maybe we should wait for Zuti. Huh? He became dear to your heart so you want a farewell? - Yes. - Leave that. There will be time. We'll meet again with him. Come on, let's move. You left me! You left me, wait! I was always with you! Subtitles by Ivona.
