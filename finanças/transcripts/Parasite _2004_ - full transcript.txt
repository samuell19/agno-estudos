OK, let's go. - Give me the police. - Connecting to it, sir. You're now speaking to police operator What's your emergency? We're the Alliance for Green Protection Our ministry of defense password is long walk. Do you understand. Yes, I understand. We're placing a bomb in Carmine Oil building. - Do you understand? - Yes, I understand. We set it to explode exactly in 4 minutes. Now. We recommend you evacuate this building immediately. This is not a false warning. Do you understand? Yes, I understand. Please stay on the line. I have confirmed the password, sir. The building will be evacuated as soon as possible. Thank you. Please, sir, stay on the... OK. The cops stay 5 minutes. So let's do this. It's all yours, you have 2 minutes. We have cops all over. OK. Let's get the way out. Let's go. Damn it, how long does it gonna take? In a minute. North east corner, 15 seconds. We meet you there. Let's go... I'll record the files. Come on man, we gotta move. Alright. Let's get the hell out of here. Ok, here we go. Come on. Ok, let's go. Come on, let's go, let's go. Hurry up... The cops are everywhere. We're Alliance for Green protection. We've just made the copies of all files related to Egypt Carmine Oil extreme test sites. Any unauthorized testing at any of these sites will be made with the right action. We're Alliance for Green Protection, we'll watching you. Nice job, guys. Let's go. Valerie, get me Christine Hansen in South American. Intention Connection now, sir. I have Dr. Hansen free, sir. Thank you, Valerie, pass me through. Christine, sorry to disturb you. Tell me about Ecuador. Right on schedule. Some minor problem with local authorities, but nothing we can't handle. Glad to hear it. How's Dr. Willies making at? Outstanding. A nice choice of a partner. Good, because I'm taking off the project. Why? We had a break in, Christine. What? A Group calling themselves the Alliance of Green Protection wrapped in my office just a few hours ago. What do they take? Seems they're most interested in our plans of future testants. Who's involved? Given your own history, I thought you'd be more than familiar with this particular organization. Christine. Richard, I hope you're not suggesting... Of course not. Your past isn't secret here, nor is the problem. Besides, Carmine Oil trusts you, Christine. I trust you. Richard, what you want? We have a maximum of 24 hours before we're exposed to the media. The partners want us to verify the integrity of your findings before we become global news. Final testing is due to take place 4 months from now. The cleaner is nowhere near ready yet. The partners have different opinions, Christine. The Enzyme hasn't even passed any kind of quality control. At this stage of development, you'd have to be insane to test in the field. You, actually. What? The partners have decided they want you to test the enzyme. I cut myself, you know that. But the partners insist that I needed here. No. No way, this is ridiculous, let me talk to Mr. Cartwright. I know you find my promotion hard to accept, Christine, but I wouldn't let you undermine my authority, and they wouldn't let you make a fool of such. It's time to be a good girl, Christine. And do as you told, we already have a platform, remote, isolated, whatever happens, it will remained secure. This is stupid, you have to re-consider. I need that rig spotless before tomorrow night. Team special will be waiting. Richard, wait. Thanks, Christine, you're an angel. Don't hang up from me, Richard. Valirie, have Dr. Williams assembled HAZCAM scuba been placed in 48 hours has done by? Consider it done, Mr. Reiser. That's my girl. Sorry didn't get chance to introduce you earlier. Split in the candle light in the last minute. Still, the Carmine Oil offers great, it's kind of difficult to say no. Over there, it's Nils, the right hand man. When he's not sleeping on the job in his lifetime, he's a highly skilled electronic expert. This is Kim Delaney, our resident great mechanic, if it broke, she'll fix it. Kim, this is Gary Decker, our replacement construction engineer. He'd better be good, Jacob, I don't want some rocky get in the way to slow things down. She's a real push count when you get to know her, I promise. Right at the spot, right at the Johny Alpha Platform. So how long at this job at this island? Some couple of days, where'll we go short? Same as usual. Good, then. Hello. Nobody's here but us chickens. Kim, go find the generator, will you? Decker, go find some storage for the cleaner fluid. Nils, you come with me, you? We have to start up the connection. Found you. These old rig gives me the creeps. You've been neglected for a long time, haven't you. Mama's here now. We gonna make it all better. Come on, girl. Don't make it any harder than it has to be. That's my girl. How long have you been working together? Too long. What was your last task? Tanker. Broke up at the Coast of Bolivia. The old night, rough sea, 70 million Gallons and a dozen men on board. No contact be made. And nothing, nobody can get to there. What happened? They helicoptered us onto it. Sure, took a 17 hours, we managed to fix the whole. The engineer you're replacing, we lost radio contact with him. Half way to the job, the guy just played disappears. His corpse floated on the coastline of Morocco a few weeks later. The official report said he failed into the sea and drowned. But asked for what really happened down that rig? Guess we'll never know. Shit! Does Is this job you ever did? Not quite alone shortly? So what are you waiting for, beautiful? Let's move these chaos. Sure, big guy, want show me how you stand. Ah, Jacob, I meant to give you this. Show me your other hand. We drink when we drop this work, not before. This kind of business get people killed, understand? Hey, hey, easy, Jacob. What's the matter with you? I just don't want to lose anybody else, that's ok? I think you got your point across. Yeah? It seems that Dr. Hansen is away passed this deadline. Let's just get the thing done, alright? Sort it out, Decker. I won't be in this though. OK. Right on time, baby. OK, I'll take it from here. You're alright here? Yeah, yeah, just think about all those wealth we gonna make from this case. 10 big ones made. It is good for another crazy one in Las Vegas. I'll leave it to you then. Nice weather we're having. What's so far? Nice weather we're having. She's a peach, huh? What brings a nice lady like you all the way here, anyway? Carefully preserved idealism, if you believe that. What? Never mind. Where the hell are we, anyway? We're the god damned downward about my French. That's what I thought. Sarah. Let's the signal, let's go, let's go. Jacob, check this out. Shit, what do you want? I've seen one of these since I was a kid, found it in the record room. What’s the matter? Nothing help. Oh, ok, I'll catch you later. Let's just get things done once, alright? What the hell is that? This is tower, the coming, over. El CV, tower, over. The satellite's showing there's a second storm running in your way. Recommends you return to the mainland before making your another drop. Over. Copy that, tower, Over. Ma'am, the boys back to the aerial field say to me that a serious storm comes. So, since I drop you off, I gotta head back to base. For the next few days, you gotta be on your own. Fabulous. Just fabulous. The foam of wall is now everywhere. Nobody will give account if this place sink into the ocean. Who cares, man? So we work on this enzyme stuff? Since when the oil company starts caring about cleaning up all these themselves? Oh, Decker, let me tell you how this crew operates. We get the job done, OK? Then we go home. You get drunk and then you lose your job, then you start moving over to the other place. No questions, no bullshit. Sounds pretty good. Then shut up, let me get the job done, keep spraying. Shit, no fluid. Back in 5. Kim, Nils, follow me down to the North end to drain the rope. Where is Decker? Finally back here. What is the shit, anyway? No, no, ah Listen, I know this cleaning business isn't part of the usual routine, but no cleaning, no contract. So, let's stay focused. Everybody get prepared for the deconstruction in 48 hours. On more cleaning session is all the net when we can go to work. Since you brought it up, I just want to let you know, I am not cleaning the toilets. It's not about hygiene, some special enzyme has been oiled. Whatever it is, just show me the money, show me the door. Right, the boss will be here in a minute. I am going on the top. You are the boss. If I found Decker drinking again, he's finished. What's your opinion? He's so serious sometime. Yeah, well, ever since... Yeah, I know, since the accident. Hey, don't make me sorry, I told you. It's not here. Well it's about it, alright? Yeah, ever since then, he's different. It's a guy there, but still just a little boy inside. Oh, mommy’s kiss will make things better. Hi, Dr. Hansen. Everything ready? Absolutely, we just finished the first grand session. What do you mean? Cleaned the north control room about 5 minutes ago. What? Who authorized that? Who's in charge here? I was. Obviously, this light gas units in this left must be cleaned and secured before the deconstruction can continue. The room all over the upper and all levels of the rig. Did I tell you we were in charge of the cleaning for the recent K-2 expedition? Really? We were commended on our speed and preparatory work. - That's the radio room. - Fine. Just down here, it's the lab. The storm's coming. Where did you get this scar, baby? I told you, tell you when I know you better. 10 years, silence. Cool you, baby-fat? Where's the mixer? We, uh, we used it. You used all? Well, yeah, I wasn't aware. This is not for cleaning dishes, Jacob. Didn't you read the instructions? Instructions? What are you talking about? Included in the consignment with the specific instructions for the careful mixing and application of this highly experimental cleaning enzyme. Jesus Christ. Where did they find you people? Mr. Rasmussen, I want you to get your crew down here right now. Look, this is my operation which makes it my rig, which means I am the one gives instructions around here. No, you listen, Jacob. You work for Carmine Oil which means you work for me. Understood? God damn it. That's just what we need around here, another hot howl speech. Where the hell is Decker? Probably... I hope you aren't suggesting there's an alcohol aboard in this rig. Well, you look like you came just a party, honey. What the hell is going on? I'll tell you what the hell is going on. Guys, guys, this is Christine Hansen, the chief scientific officer comes from Carmine Oil. She is at the supervisor of the distribution of cleaner. Shit. What now? We have problems with Generator 1. Nothing works. Kim, Nils, check it out. Hang it up again, Jacob. When do we move? Soon. Stop looking at my ass, Nils. I can't help you, baby. You are a girl, I am a boy. If you can reach any higher, you're welcome to kiss it. You know how funny eh. I've never seen Jacob take that kind of shit before. Yeah, he was not himself these days, right? Yeah. And I don't even cope with executive's interference. You know, I don't like it. Don't ever wrap that case. We got work to do. Hey, you mean you got work to do. Well, at least I know I’m doing. Yeah, that's what you reckon. Here, try these often-size. Ok, thanks. I hope that fit. Thanks. I'll be..., uh... I'll be back in 10. Oh, damn..., Man. I need to in fetch my valve. Can you move this thing and let me pass in? Yeah. Oh, no. Never mind. Where is she? Dr. Hansen at Carmine Oil, over. Receiving it loud and clear, Dr. Hansen. Passing you to Mr. Reiser Now. Over. Christine, what do you have for me? Richard, the clean-up team started without me. They may have over-dosed the cleaner. That doesn't really concern me. My question, Christine, is this Does it work? Too early to tell. Who are these people, anyway? Did you get any kind of briefing at all? I asked you not to question my authority, Christine. The partners don't know anything about this, do they, Richard? Do they! Just do your job, Christine. Contact me when you have some conclusive data. Good bye, Christine. Just to move this thing a little. Here. It does make you feel better, doesn't it? Why don't you behave yourself and start for me, OK? That's it. That's good. Ah, not so bad. You have problems now. Go. Damn it. What? You gonna drive me irrational, bitch? You're having fun with that pipes? I want to help you out, but you know how it is... Shut up, Nils. I got the whole tool bags for the way to twist you into serious pains. Promises, promises. Doctor? Doctor Hansen? Jesus. Hold that. Over, over this. Higher. God. Something bit my hand. Go over to Jacob and get him for checked out. Good girl. Doctor Hansen to Carmine Oil. Over. Doctor Hansen to Carmine Oil. Over. It must be the storm. Christ. What you want? There's been a problem. What is it? With one of my crew. Speak it out. It's Decker. He is... Something bit my hand. Jesus Christ, what you want? What is going on here? What did you do this time? Something bit my damned hand. Stay there. Get up. Hi. What is this? How did you get on board? Who are you people? Quiet, everyone. Everything will be clear soon enough. Where's the other one? The girl. The generator. Gio. Don't make this too difficult. I don't want to hurt you. What the hell is that? And who are you? This rat became a cat in this rig. You pull out, move. Back. Ok, we're all here now. Stay quiet and listen up. We're World Associate Press, we're the members for Alliance Green Protection, we're here by occupy the Johny Alpha Rig to demand immediate ceasing of the plan for deconstruction. We're not armed. It's our intention to remain onboard with 4 Carmine Oil workers peacefully defend and assure the detonation and deconstruction of this rig do not proceed. Carmine Oil has refused to cooperate... Damn! Darcy, turn the video light on. What the hell is that? That something's here. Stay calm. Stay calm. Here, set these people free. We have to cut the snake. What is this? Oh, that is gross. It stinks, man. What the hell is that thing? Thanks. You are welcome. We need to get this to the lab. What do you think you're doing here? Play god? You astonished me. Right action, as I always told you. Level. Haven't you ever expected to change things from the outside? The same old Mickey. Take. Here in the real world, so many things to get done. Ready. Wow, I've never seen such genetic acceleration. And the trace of my enzyme is here. Well, you mean the cleaner, right? Yeah, the cleaner. Mickey, pass me some of the mix. Take that, I'll just need a piece. I thought you people were vegetarians. Ok, this is pretty simple. The mix is away too strong. There is excessive accelerant which made it volatile. It's reacting away beyond its parameters. We shouldn't do this to the meat. So, what is it? No idea. Probably a bacteria flourish. That's all I can tell you. Except that it should be microscopic, of course. And? Well, I presume there's more than one of these, and they're still growing. Yeah? What? Welcome come to the food chain. Oh, great. Ok, everyone, calm down. Possibly they can still be growing. We're not leaving this rig. Forget that protest, Gio. Mickey? Yeah, we need to leave. We'll check the radio for help. Great plan, brains, but your monkey smashed the radio and turned it to a sour creature. Ok, listen up, we need to take actions now. Gio, get the girl to the generator, get going. If it's totally dead, here's a back-up. Gio, watch yourself, and watch her. Darcy, keep the door. I'll check the map of the rig for the best place to evacuate. Security keys. - Keys? - Come on. Keep your eyes open. Where's the map? In my briefcase in the locker room. My keys. Look, I know Mickey may think that we're in this together, but I don't trust you for a second. That's the way it is. The door stays locked. So how did you know I was here. Ways and means, Christine. Whatever it takes. So congratulations, Mickey, you've moved up a level. Kidnapping now. When did you become part of the problem you tried to solve? You know, Christine, I don't have to listen to this crap anymore. Six year's plenty. Let's just get out of the rig safe. You're the one making the whole situation dangerous. You and your little gang. And why? Because you want to get famous. That's why. Oh man, Christine, you used to have an attitude. Whatever happened to that? I was here to test my new cleaner, Mickey. I clean them so this structure don't kill half a million fish when they sink them. Something actually can help the environment. You know, something real. Oh yeah, that's great. Look, I'm sorry I smashed you earlier. Look that you can take it anyway. I don't like violence. Oh, but the hostage taking is alright. This is important for Mickey. Important for Mickey, yeah. What about you? Look, I didn't have much until Mickey came along to tell me things. He showed me what was wrong with the world, and he showed me how to do something about it. Yeah, it's good to belong. You might need some of that. What is it with you people? I thought you want to see this rig destroyed. Yeah, maybe. But not something in the middle of the ocean. Do you have any idea what it will do to the sea life in this region? I didn't know about it. Like you never do. What was it with those two, anyway. Your man and Doctor Hansen. Your lead seems about to follow her, if you don't mind I think so. No way, he's the best. He's fighting people like you since I was a kid. Real thing. Christine used to be the same. Oh, yeah? Sure. We used to be in Brazilian rain forest, Japanese whaling even survived during the Rainbow War attacked by the French. In the eighties. Back in the days. Ok, you're right, as usual. I am sorry. Ok? Mickey, you're always sorry. But I don't think you actually know what it means. Wait a second. Why you're always running away from me? My values haven't changed, I'm just working the system from the inside. It's that simple, and you can't deal with it. You lost the sight of what it was we were trying to deal, and you lost the sigh of us. We never spent any time together, but money became your thing. Look, just because I don't live with you anymore doesn't mean I forgot how to live. Why don't we just put this behind us? I honestly don't know. Is that my watch? No. We are here. Generator 1. Generator 2. And the lab, here. Oh, god. Christine. Mickey. Christine, will you get over here. This is important when we to get off the rig. Oh my god. There is an escape capsule in the north of the rig. Come on. Stay cool, nobody is going anywhere. Look, I just need to see Christine. Relax, they should be back soon. Give me the keys. No away. - Give me the keys. - No, stop it. Give me the keys! Just give me the keys! Nils, tire her arms. Give me the keys, girl. - Stop it! Stop it! - You stay quiet. - Give me the keys! - Stop! Stop! Leave me alone. - Give me the keys! - Stop! Can you do some help over here. I need to reach for that valve. Can you move that away? A piece of cake. Damn, it's heavy. Sorry. Where did you get that scar? I was helping out my Dad's garage when I was a kid. You had an accident? No, I was working one night and neighbor's dog got the news. You gotta attached by a dog? Took a piece out of my arm, Luckily Papa was there. Hold the thing up for me. Thanks. Haven't been near one ever since. Gio. Yeah, coming. God damn it, that was going. Forget it, it's dead. Whatever did that, it's gone. She's dead. Where is Jacob? This is Mickey, listen carefully. Forget the generator and get back to the lab. And Jacob, get your ass down here. Ok, we got a way out of this thing. How? There's a set of emergency capsule in the north section of the rig. Sounds good to me. We are there yet, though. Christine, first thing is we don't know how many men that can take. - Or women? - Thank you, Gio. Yeah, thanks, Gio. We don't know how many people that can take. My guess is enough for the men in the rig, - whatever that one is. - You are right. The second thing is, we need full power for the launching. We need it quick. So that's forget about Generator 1. It's down. There is another generator in area 2. - We can do that. - That wouldn't be pretty easy. The storm's pretty rough out there. No problem. We don't know how many the things around that spot 2. Piece of cake. Ok, I'll meet you in the pod room. - Wait. - What is it? This is the secure room, we need the key. Where is the key to the rig? Not me. Look, it's just a guess. Jacob. We have been boarded by armed terrorists. They are threatening to blow up the rig with Explosives. Send help. Send help. He's in there. I can hear the keyboard. Jacob, open the damn door, or I'll kick in. Jacob, open the door, man. We need the keys. There must be another way out. Great idea, Gio. Cannot go in there blind. Not a good picture. It's the best we can get from a remote. Right. And now left. Keep going and pass the intersection. Turn right. Looks clean enough. Just a little bit ahead, and turn left. And we'll almost there. It stuck. We're in the computer room, I think. Well, we aren't going anywhere. No problem, the vent are now cleared. The vent we saw, sure. No planned it on the tour advance. Cannot see all the vents. It's just once your boss hided it out. Ok, here we go. Watch yourself. That's your last minute words of advice. Yeah, don't die. I'll see you. - Let me go, Mickey. - Nothing I like better to do, but it's too damned things for you to fit. Talk to Jacob. Gio, generator. Let's go. Be careful, alright. We don't anyone else not making his way here. Hey. Stay healthy, baby. I'll go talk to Jacob. I don't want to die, man. You know? No here. No way for we to get out of this one. Shut up, Jacob. We've been in totally boost before. The K-2 drop? I was with you there. And I'm not going anywhere now. So I reckon you should trust me when I tell you we can get out of this rig, all of us. Nils. Something I need to tell you before it's too late. I'm listening. My wife, I left her to die. I left her to die to save myself. What are you talking about? It was an accident. The engine cut down, it's proved. Well, stop blaming yourself. When the plane crashed, I just wanted to get out. I just wanted to survive. I left her to burn. It's not true. You had no time. Nothing you could've done. Let it go, Jacob. About the situation here, right now, a lot of people are now in danger. Jesus Christ, Nils. There's one in here. It's coming in. Jacob, take it easy, man. Mickey. I thought you were one of those things. What are you doing here? Give me those keys. Ok, now let's get out of here. Get something to get the room bound. Are these friends of yours alright? They are alright. Friends like those killing the whole damn planet. Look, Jacob... Gio, come on. This way. Go. Let's just go! Gio, Come on. Gio, Come on. Thank god. You're still alive. Let me show you something. Look at this. It's acidic. Yes, this is acidic. I don't think it's just simple acid. Something more complex is in there. Wait a second, where are you going? Look, I can take care of myself. Nils. You are not my guarding angel, man. So leave me alone. Hey, you need me, man. No, I don't need you or anybody. I survived in a plane crash, you remember? I can handle this, so you just leave me alone. I was wondering why they were attacking. I mean we aren't threatening them, if they leave us alone, we leave them alone. They came out to attack. Why would they do that? Food? They haven't eaten anyone, Mickey. They seems are predators. They are spreading spores, trying to find holes for their seeds. These things are parasites. It is rare. Well, just because we haven't seen it before doesn't mean it can't happen. Watch this. Amazing. These things living or dead as long as are organic, they survive to reproduce. That's fine while they're such big. But when it's bigger, who's gonna host anything else. Look at them. Christine, there are huge implications here. Imagine the potential for their use. Oil spilling age. Refinery cleaning, short coast clean-up. No, Mickey, they are away to be predictable. We gotta deal with this before things really get out of control. Jacob! Jacob! Damn it, man. Where are you? I don't like to get around here while those things might be out. Just leave me alone, Nils. Get out of my face. I told you I don't need you. What happened to you? You'd be smarter than this. I'll go away from here. Neither you nor anyone could stop me. Look, you and me again back to the others. Ok? So how big are these parts? No idea, just can get there to see what we can do. Hey, it's my watch. No, it's not. It's mine. The watch I bought you. Well, a girl gotta know the time. This way. Ok, wait. We are here about the galley. We go left and up to the north. Then straight on to to the capsule. Let's go. We have pod 4 or 5. We still need power. - It's here? - I guess so. Let's go. You're going to take long with this generator? A few to be fixed then it could be like Christmas tree. Hurry up! I cannot hold the door any longer. A few more seconds. Bingo. Nice job, Gio. Let's get the thing ready. Damn it. What a good mechanic I was. Turn primary key to A. Mark on switch which is 1 to 5. Turn on emergency power fit. Switch there. Something's wrong. You don't get away from me that easy. We need to get together, right? OK, emergency platform power must be activated from emergency launch. Emergency power automatically activated when the normal power is lost. Damn. That means we must go back and get that power on. Nils. Wait a second. Let me casual my breath. It's may fault, Nils. I mixed the enzyme with too much accelerator. It's all my fault. I always knew you'll get us killed. Wasn't I so tired, I would've kicked your ass. Hang on. The key is one way. What does that mean? It means once the launch is activated, that's it. If the emergency power returns, those things are launching. Then we'll screwed. I'm sorry for what happened, alright? It's nothing. Let's get out of here before we end up as the worm food, OK? No, it's a count-down system. We can slow it can be positive from here. Ok, simple then. You stay here. I'll fix the power, you start to launch. I get back, off the gear. Happy ever after. Are we? What? Happy ever after? Get out of here. Wait for me. Oh, shit. Don't do this to me. Sarah. Let's come in. Get up. Get in the pod, Mickey. I've had enough for this shit. Jacob. Jacob. Jacob. Jacob... Shit. Christine. Mickey, are you OK? Fine, that's fine. Ok, get us out of here. Hang on, Mickey. Ready? Hang on, Mickey. Get me out of here. Come on! LAUNCH ABORTED INTEGRITY COMPROMISE Come on! Come on! Bastard! Mickey. Blow it up. Blow it up. Mickey. Mickey. Eat them, damn. Mickey. We made it. Finally some time alone. Come here. Do you have that connection for me yet? Passing it through now, sir. That's my girl. Hello, Mr. Reiser. How are you, sir? Very good, Thank you, Dr. Willis. I read your report. How are things proceeding? We just enter the last phase of clean-up operation, sir. In a few hours, there would be nothing suggests those recent events were anything but a tragic mess-up. Very Good. Tell me about the mutations. Several organisms survived in explosion and are in excellent prospect. For additional research, I'll breed it, if necessary. Remarkable how things work out sometimes, isn't it? Give me updates, Dr. Willis. What is it? Sorry to bother you, sir. I just received a strange phone call. Before hanging up, they made reference to a video tape under your desk. Valerie sweet heart. Why don't you go ahead hold on my calls for a half hour? Of course, Mr. Reiser. Over here. Hey, good. To the directors of Carmine Oil, We're the Alliance for Green Protection. These laboratories countered International treaties on genetic research and poses a serious biological in natural environment and to human settlements nearby. Once the staff is being evacuated, this facility will be safely destroyed, and the evidence of Carmine Oil of illegal activities will be exposed to the mess media. As you can see, Mr. Reiser, We bypassed all your security system both here in Ecuador and in Dallas your headquarters. Copies of all files relating to activities in board Alpha Oil Rig have been sent to your superiors and to the relevant authorities. You've been a bad boy, haven't you, Richard? Time to face up to the consequences. What is it, for Christ's sake, Valerie, I told you I was busy. Yes, I know. I'm sorry, Mr. Reiser. But Mr. Cartwright is here to see you. There are two gentlemen with him, they said, they're with the police.
