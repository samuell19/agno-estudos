Can't keep my eyes From the circling skies Tongue tied and twisted Just an earth Bound misfit I Ice is forming On the tips of my wings Unheeded warnings I thought I thought Of everything No navigator To find my way home Unladened empty Turned to stone A soul in tension Is learning to fly Condition grounded But determined to try Can't keep my eyes From the circling skies Tongue tied and twisted Just an earth Bound misfit I Above the planet On a wing and a prayer My grubby halo A vapour trail In the empty air Above the clouds I see My shadow fly Out of the corner Of my watering eye A dream unthreatened By the morning light Could blow this soul right Through the roof Of the night There's no sensation To compare with this Suspended animation A state of bliss Can't keep my mind From the circling skies Tongue-tied and twisted Just an earth Bound misfit I HIGH HOPES Beyond the horizon Of the place we lived When we were young In a world of Magnets and miracles Our thoughts strayed constantly And without boundary The ringing of the Division bell Had began Along the long road And on down The causeway Do they still meet There by the cut? There was a ragged band That followed in our footsteps Running before time Took our dreams away Leaving the myriad small creatures Trying to tie Us to the ground To a life consumed By slow decay The grass was greener The light was brighter With friends surrounded The nights of wonder Looking beyond the embers The bridges glowing Behind us To a glimpse of how green It was on the other side Steps taken forwards But sleep-walking back again Dragged by the force Of some inner tide At a higher altitude With flag unfurled We reached The dizzy heights Of that dreamed of world Encumbered forever By desire and ambition There's a hunger Still unsatisfied Our weary eyes Still stray to the horizon Though down this road We've been so many times The grass was greener The light was brighter The taste was sweeter The nights of wonder With friends surrounded The dawn mist glowing The water flowing The endless river Forever and ever TAKE IT BACK Her love rains Down on me Easy as the breeze I listen to her breathing it sounds like The waves on the sea I was thinking All about her Burning with rage And desire We were spinning Into darkness And the earth Was on fire She could Take it back She might Take it back Some day So I spy on her I lied to her I make promises I cannot keep Then I hear her Laughter rising Rising from the deep And I make her prove Her love to me I take all That I can take And I push her To the limit To see If she will break She might Take it back She could Take it back Some day Now I had seen The warnings Screaming From all sides It's easy to Ignore them God knows I've tried All of this temptation you know it turned My faith to lies Until I couldn't See the danger Or feel The rising tide She Can Take it back She could Take it back Some day She can Take it back She will Take it back Some day She will Take it back She will Take it back Some day COMING BACK TO LIFE Where were you when I was burned And broken While the days slipped by from my window Watching And Where were you? When I was hurt And I was helpless Because the things you say And the things you do Surround me While you were Hanging yourself On someone else's words Dying to believe In what you heard I was staring straight into the shining sun Lost In thought And lost in time While the seeds of life And the seeds of change Were planted Outside The rain Fell dark and slow While I pondered on This dangerous But irresistible Past-time I took a heavenly Ride through our silence I knew the Moment had Arrived For killing the past And coming back to life I took a heavenly Ride trough our silence I knew the waiting Had begun And headed straight Into the shining sun SORROW The sweet smell Of a great sorrow Lies over the land Plumes of smoke rise Merge into the Leaden sky A man lies and dreams Of green fields and rivers But awakes to a morning With no reason for waking He's haunted by the memory Of a lost paradise In his youth or a dream He can't be precise He's chained forever To a world that's departed It's not enough It's not enough His blood has frozen And curdled with fright His knees have trembled And given way in the night His hand has weakened At the moment of truth His step has faltered One world One soul Time pass The river rolls And he talks to the river Of lost love and dedication And silent replies That swirl invitation Flow dark and troubled To an oily sea A grim intimation Of what is to be There's an unceasing wind That blows through this night And there's dust in my eyes That blinds my sight And silence that speaks so Much louder that words Of promises broken KEEP TALKING For millions of years Mankind lived just like the animals Then something happened Which unleashed the power Of our imagination We learned to talk There's a silence surrounding me I can't seem to think straight I'll sit in the corner No one will bother me I think I should speak now Why won't you talk to me? I can't seem to speak now You never talk to me My words won't come out right What are you thinking? I feel like I'm drowning What are you feeling? I'm feeling weak now Why won't you talk to me? But I can't show my weakness You never talk to me I sometimes wonder What are you thinking? Where do we go from here What are you feeling? It doesn't have to be like this All we need to do Is make sure we keep talking Why won't you talk to me? I feel like I'm drowning You never talk to me You know I can't breathe now What are you thinking? We're going nowhere What are you feeling? We're going nowhere Why won't you talk to me? You never talk to me What are you thinking? Where do we go from here? It doesn't have to be like this All we need to do Is make sure we keep talking ANOTHER BRICK IN THE WALL [PART 2] We don't need No education We don’t need No thought control No dark sarcasm In the classroom Teachers leave Them kids alone Hey!
