THE FIRST FILM WRITTEN AND DIRECTED BY REN? CLAIR PARIS ASLEEP One evening, Paris went to sleep... ...and the following morning... ...the night watchman in the Eiffel Tower... ...wonders why... ...not a thing is stirring in the city... ...and since no one comes... CHIEF OF POLICE At the Paris airport. Everything came to a standstill last night... ...except for me up in the Eiffel Tower. And us in our plane. A thief always comes in handy. We mustn't let it get us down! I'll see that every shop is open for you... ...even the Bank of France! Paris is all theirs. But what good are riches... ...when you're bored? If anyone's listening... ...please come to... A handkerchief in the window. This is where the powerful rays came from... ...that put everyone to sleep. It's my uncle, Professor X! You must wake everyone up! I never thought of that! I'll give it a try. It's 3:25 a.m., the same time. You betrayed me! We're going to make some money... thanks to your uncle's invention. The whole city was asleep for four days. You all say the same thing! We're all telling the truth. Go tell your tales somewhere else. Did we dream this whole thing up? No, it wasn't a dream! THE END
