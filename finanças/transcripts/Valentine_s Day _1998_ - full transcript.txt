( typewriter keys clicking slowly ) ( typewriter dings ) SHIT, MAN. YOU SCARED THE HELL OUT OF ME. TAKE IT. I HAVEN'T GOT TIME TO PLAY WITH YOU, PHIL. YOU SEE ALL THAT WORK I GOT? YOU'RE BACK ON. WHAT? IT WASN'T EASY. JENNINGS FOUGHT ME EVERY INCH OF THE WAY, BUT YOU'RE BACK ON. MAYBE HE'S RIGHT, MAN. NO, HE'S NOT. NEVER WAS, NOT ABOUT ANY OF THAT SHIT THEY TALK ABOUT YOU. I'M COOL. I LIKE IT DOWN HERE. ( laughs ) RIGHT. WE NEED YOU, PARTNER. YOU KNOW THE O.C. PLAYERS BETTER THAN ANYBODY. YOU'RE BACK ON, JACK. ( distant siren wailing ) I OWE YOU, MAN. YOU DON'T OWE ME ANYTHING. ( siren wailing ) ( crash ) TONY. - YEAH? DID I EVER TELL YOU ABOUT THE TIME I WAS IN BOARDING SCHOOL? NAH, YOU DIDN'T. IT WAS DURING NAP TIME. OH, BABY. IT WAS SO HOT, I'VE DOZED OFF. OH, YEAH. YOU KNOW HOW I DOZED OFF? HOW? I WAS NAKED UNDER THE SHEETS. OH, YEAH? THAT'S THE WAY I LIKE YOU. WHAT HAPPENED? WELL, THEN MY LITTLE HAND DROPPED DOWN AND IT ACCIDENTALLY BURST MY SCHOOL RING - BETWEEN MY THIGHS. - OH, YEAH. AND THEN YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED? Tony: What happened? Woman: I was in the perfect place between sleeping and dreaming. I slowly felt your hands stroking me, caressing me gently... Then... ARE YOU MAINTAINING TONIGHT, PARTNER? HMM? OH, YEAH, I'M FINE, MAN. I'M FINE. JUST TURN IT UP A LITTLE BIT. WHAT, ARE YOU A PERVERT? THIS IS LIKE SOME BAD PENTHOUSE LETTER. IT'S PERFECT IF YOUR BOYFRIEND'S A CHEESEBALL LIKE TONY D. HEY. ( honks horn ) ( muffled gunshot ) WHAT WAS THAT? SHIT. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? WHERE ARE YOU GOING? I DON'T BELIEVE THIS. CALL FOR BACKUP. ( Tony and woman moaning ) ( woman screams ) ( rapid gunfire ) MAKE IT FAST. ( tires screech ) POLICE! - ANYONE ELSE IN HERE? - HUH-UH. - NO? - NO. TONY FUCKING D. SIX MONTHS DOWN THE DRAIN. COME HERE. SIT DOWN. YOU ALL RIGHT? - I THINK SO. - GOOD. FACES-- WHAT DID THEY LOOK LIKE? FACES, YOU KNOW? YOU'RE NOT GOING MUTE ON ME, ARE YOU? LOOK, IT WAS A PERFECT DATE. I THINK I'LL ORDER PIZZA. YOU MUST BE THE SENTIMENTAL TYPE, HUH, ALMA? SO YOU KNOW MY NAME. YOU KNOW WHAT IT MEANS? NOT A FUCKING CLUE, BUT I KNOW TONY OVER THERE-- HE PAYS FOR THIS PLACE, DON'T HE? SO YOU'VE BEEN WATCHING ME. THAT'S CREEPY. YOU PUT ON SUCH A NICE SHOW. HE PAID FOR YOU TOO? HOURLY OR WEEKLY? HEY, JACK, EASE UP. HEY, PHIL. MEET ALMA. BE VERY GENTLE WITH HER. SHE'S QUITE UPSET. Jack: HOW DOES THIS GET TO BE MY FUCK-UP? YOU WERE SITTING ON YOUR ASS 20' AWAY, JACK. WE WERE THERE TO MONITOR ONLY. IT'S NOT OUR FAULT IF TONY DOESN'T TAKE POLICE PROTECTION. I DON'T CARE. BOTTOM LINE IS, WE GUARANTEED TONY WOULD TURN STATE'S EVIDENCE AND SOME HITTER TAKES HIM OUT RIGHT UNDER YOUR NOSE. AND NOW THE MAYOR, THE D.A. AND THE FUCKING F.B.I. ESPECIALLY ARE ALL OVER MY BACK. ARE YOU READY, PHIL? - ALL SET. - F.B.I.? THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING THIS DOG-AND-PONY SHOW FOR-- BILL KEENAN? THAT'S RIGHT. - WHY? WHY? BECAUSE HE WANTS IT. BUT THAT'S BULLSHIT, MAN. I HAVE BRIEFED THIS GUY AT LEAST A DOZEN TIMES MYSELF. LISTEN, THE MAYOR'S ASKED THE F.B.I. TO RUN THIS TASK FORCE. KEENAN HAS THE AXE OVER YOU AND OVER ME. IT'S TIME TO PUCKER UP, JACK. SORRY WE'RE LATE. DOES EVERYBODY KNOW EVERYBODY? SPECIAL AGENT IN CHARGE BILL KEENAN. AND, BILL, THIS IS HEAD OF THE ORGANIZED CRIME SQUAD FRANK JENNINGS DETECTIVE PHIL KELLY AND DETECTIVE JACK VALENTINE. 'MORNING, COUNSELOR. Phil: THE NUMBER-TWO MAN IN THE MASSINO FAMILY, A.K.A. TONY D, SICILIAN, A REAL OLD-SCHOOL KNEE-BREAKER. WHOEVER TOOK TONY OUT HAD TO BE AN INSIDER. NO ONE KNEW ABOUT THE GIRL. RIGHT NOW THE BIG QUESTION IS WHO ON THE INSIDE SENT THOSE HITTERS TO WHACK OUT TONY D. IS THAT THE GIRL? SHE'S BEAUTIFUL. IS SHE COOPERATING? SO FAR JUST NAME, RANK AND SERIAL NUMBER. STANDARD ARM PIECE, I'D SAY, DOES SOME MODELING AROUND TOWN. YEAH, WELL, WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, KEENAN, - I THINK SHE'S A LITTLE MORE THAN THAT. - YEAH? HOW? WELL, IN THAT SITUATION STANDARD ARM PIECE GOES CATATONIC. THIS CHICK-- SHE-- SHE HARDLY BLINKED. WHAT'S ON THE TAPES? A LOT OF SEXY STUFF, OOH-ING AND AH-ING. TONY REALLY HAD IT FOR THIS GIRL. LET'S FORGET THE GIRL FOR A SECOND. SHOW US THE SUSPECTS. WHO DO YOU THINK ORDERED THE HIT? Phil: JOE MASSINO, ALSO KNOWN AS JOE BUDDHA, HEAD OF THE BUFFALO FARM TEAM FOR THE CRIME FAMILY IN NEW YORK CITY. AS BUFFALO'S UNDERBOSS, HE WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO HAD THE AUTHORITY TO ISSUE THE HIT ON TONY D-- THAT IS, IF THE HIT WAS OFFICIAL. JOE BUDDHA HAS INTENSE CONVERSATIONS WITH PARKING METERS IN LITTLE ITALY. I THINK HE NEEDS HELP PUTTING ON HIS PANTS IN THE MORNING. YOU THINK SO? I DON'T. HE STILL WEARS THE HAT. MAYBE HE FOUND OUT TONY WAS GONNA TURN STATE'S EVIDENCE. YEAH? AND HOW'D HE DO THAT? HAS TO BE A LEAK. WHO ELSE YOU GOT? Phil: WELL, BESIDES JOE, THE OTHER FAMILY INSIDER WHO MIGHT HAVE SENT THE HITTERS AFTER TONY D IS MICHAEL NOCERA. MICHAEL NOCERA, A.K.A. THE YUPPIE DON. A REAL GENERATION GAP BETWEEN HIM, TONY AND JOE. WORD IS, MICHAEL IS ITCHING TO TAKE JOE BUDDHA'S PLACE AS HEAD OF THE MASSINO FAMILY. JACK. MICHAEL IS LIKE THE POSTER BOY FOR UPWARD MOBILITY. HE WENT TO PRINCETON... - TILL THEY KICKED HIM OUT. ...DEVELOPS REAL ESTATE, HAS A PIECE OF A RECORD COMPANY, PULLS IN A COUPLE EXTRA MILLION A WEEK FOR JOE BUDDHA AND THE LATE TONY D IN THE GASOLINE TAX SCAM. THE COUNTY, STATE AND FEDS ALL COLLECT TAX ON GASOLINE. NOCERA RUNS 300 MILLION GALLONS A MONTH THROUGH FIVE STATES. COLLECTS THE TAX, CLOSES IT DOWN AND KEEPS THE TAXES. SHELL COMPANIES WITHIN SHELL COMPANIES, REGISTERED BACK TO SOME GUY NAMED JUAN IN PANAMA-- YESTERDAY'S NEWS, OLD HAT. MAYBE TONY HAS A BEEF WITH SOMEBODY IN NEW YORK OR LAS VEGAS. LIKE WHO? YOU GOT NOTHING, GENTLEMEN. YOU'RE GRASPING AT STRAWS. EXCUSE ME, KEENAN, WEREN'T YOU THE ONE THAT WANTED O.C. SHOW-AND-TELL DAY? WHAT I WANT TO KNOW IS WHY A DETECTIVE WITH VALENTINE'S HISTORY WAS TAKEN OFF A DESK FOR SOMETHING THIS BIG. ALL DUE RESPECT, IT'S WHERE HE BELONGS. JACK'S THE ONE KNOWS THESE GUYS. HE'S GOT ALL THE RELATIONSHIPS. YEAH, PLUS HE'S A GOOD COP. WELL, HE USED TO BE, SURE, BUT I NEED SOMEBODY WHO'S HITTING ON ALL CYLINDERS. IF JACK MAY SPEAK FOR HIMSELF FOR A MINUTE, KEENAN, THAT'S ALL HISTORY. IT TOOK YOU SIX GODDAMN MONTHS TO SET UP TONY D. - YOU'VE ONLY GOT TWO WEEKS. - FOR WHAT? TO GET ME SOMETHING TO ROLL THESE GUYS UP. YOU KNOW, YOU GLIDE UP IN HERE THREATENING PEOPLE. YOU THREATEN FRANK. AND NOW YOU START THREATENING ME. JACK. I'M COOL, MAN. TWO WEEKS, THAT'S IT. WHAT DO YOU SAY, JACK? - I SAY WE FIND THE LEAK. WHERE DO YOU START? TONY D'S GIRL IS AS GOOD A PLACE AS NAY. THAT'S A WASTE OF TIME. WELL, RIGHT NOW, KEENAN, THAT'S ALL WE GOT. OKAY. BUT DON'T COME BEGGING FOR YOUR JOB BACK WHEN IT DOESN'T WORK OUT. GENTLEMEN, COUNSELOR. DETECTIVE VALENTINE, COULD I HAVE A WORD WITH YOU? THANK YOU, DETECTIVE KELLY. WELL, THAT CERTAINLY WAS FUN. WHAT IF KEENAN COMES BACK FOR HIS BOW TIE? I DON'T CARE ABOUT KEENAN. I CARE ABOUT YOU. YOU LOOK LIKE YOU'VE LOST A LOT OF WEIGHT. WELL, THE NICE THING ABOUT A LITTLE ANXIETY IS YOU LOSE WEIGHT WITHOUT HAVING TO DO ON A DIET. AND YOU LOOK LIKE YOU'RE NOT GETTING ENOUGH SLEEP EITHER. ARE YOU STILL HAVING THOSE DREAMS? - YOU MEAN THE NIGHTMARES? - MM-HMM. A TRIPLE FEATURE EVERY NIGHT. YOU KNOW, YOU SHOULD LET ME COOK YOU DINNER LATER ON IN THE WEEK. I THOUGHT WE WEREN'T DOING THAT ANYMORE. JACK, IT'S JUST DINNER, NOT YOUR HAND IN MARRIAGE. THINK ABOUT IT. OH, HI, SUGAR PIE. NOW WHAT ARE YOU DOING BACK DOWN HERE? WELL, I MISSED YOU. AND I WANTED TO GET A LITTLE INFORMATION. WHAT DO YOU NEED? - A WOMAN NAMED ALMA ANSON. - OKAY. NOW SHE'S A WITNESS IN THE TONY DENISIO MURDER CASE. WHAT DO YOU WANT TO KNOW? ANY LITTLE TIDBIT YOU CAN GET ME. ♪ WHEN THEY TURN THE LIGHTS OUT ♪ ♪ THE FACE IS IN THE SHADOW... ♪ WE'RE FINE. - HEY, HO, HO. - HEY, JACK. - YOU LOOK GREAT, MAN. - HOLY SHIT. WELL... - HEY, A DRINK, COME ON. - NO, NO, NOT RIGHT NOW. NO, NO, I-- - HEY, TOMMY, TOMMY. - WHAT? LET ME TALK TO YOU A SECOND. WHAT DO YOU THINK? ABOUT WHAT? WHAT DO YOU MEAN, ABOUT WHAT?

TOMMY, GIVE ME SOMETHING. I KNOW YOU'VE SEEN THIS KIND OF SHIT BEFORE. TELL ME ABOUT TONY. YEAH, I THINK IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS, YOU KNOW-- YOU'RE NEVER GONNA FIND OUT WHO DID ALL OF THIS. LIKE MAYBE 20 YEARS FROM NOW, YOU KNOW, YOU MIGHT FIND OUT THAT-- TOMMY, TOMMY, I AIN'T GOT 20 YEARS. TELL ME SOMETHING. WHAT ABOUT THAT TALL, SKINNY BLOND GIRL HE WAS SEEING? I'M BEING HONEST HERE, JACK. WHAT CAN I TELL YOU? I GOTTA GO. - TOMMY. - CALL ME, CALL ME. ( crows cawing ) - ( speaking Latin ) ( camera shutter clicking ) HEY, HEY, LOOK WHO'S PAYING MICHAEL NOCERA A VISIT. YEAH, TONY D'S NUMBER-ONE GUYS. HE SEEM HAPPY ABOUT IT TO YOU? IT'S A FUNERAL, JACK. HE'S NOT SUPPOSED TO LOOK HAPPY. NO, MAN, THAT'S BULLSHIT. THEY'RE LEANING ON HIM, MAN. THREE-TO-TWO IT'S 'CAUSE NO ONE KNOWS FOR SURE WHO KILLED TONY D. WHAT, YOU THINK NOCERA? HE'S NOT THAT STUPID. Jack: HEY, MAN, HOLD ON NOW. HEY, LOOK WHO SHOWED UP. GOD DAMN. - YOU BITCH. - UH-OH. YOU BITCH. WHORE! HOW DARE YOU? HOW DARE YOU? WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE? HEY, WHATEVER YOU'RE THINKING, DON'T DO IT. PHIL, THEY KNOW WE'RE HERE. I'M JUST GONNA RATTLE THE CAGE A LITTLE BIT. - WHAT THE HELL FOR? - TO PISS OF THE WILD ANIMALS. - NOW TRUST ME ON THIS. I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING. - JACK. SON OF A BITCH. OH, SORRY, I'M A LITTLE LATE. A GUY IS DEAD. NOW THIS IS ALL BULLSHIT. YOU ARE OUT OF ORDER. WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, JOEY, JOEY, TECHNICALLY I HAD A RELATIONSHIP WITH TONY TOO. I CAN'T PAY MY LAST RESPECTS? WHAT DID I SAY? JUST LEAVE US THE FUCK ALONE. ALL RIGHT. I CAN SEE WHEN I'M NOT WANTED. OKAY. MICHAEL, FELLOWS. ( sighs ) THE GUY GIVES ME A LARGE PAIN. YOU KNOW THAT MAN? A LONG TIME AGO, FROM THE NEIGHBORHOOD. IS THAT ALL? HE USED TO BE AROUND ALL THE TIME, ALWAYS POKING HIS NOSE IN. YEAH. HOW GOOD DO YOU KNOW HIM? JUST ANOTHER HUMP WITH A BADGE, JOE. YOU SEE ANYTHING IN THERE, ANYONE YOU RECOGNIZE? HUH-UH, SORRY. IT ALL HAPPENED TOO QUICKLY. ( through speaker ) I didn't get a good look. Okay. WHAT SCHOOL DID YOU GO TO? ST. MARY'S, BOSTON, TILL THEY KICKED ME OUT FOR TALKING BACK TO THE NUNS. MM. FAMILY? DOES IT UPSET YOU IF I ASK YOU ABOUT YOUR FAMILY? YOU CAN'T UPSET ME, DETECTIVE. GOOD. IF YOU MUST KNOW, MY MOTHER DIED WHEN I WAS FIVE. MY FATHER DIED WHEN I WAS EIGHT. How long have you known Tony D? - ONE MONTH. - WHERE DID YOU MEET? WHERE THE GIRLS MEET THE BOYS-- AT SOME PARTY. DID IT MAYBE BOTHER YOU WHO HE WAS? DID IT MAYBE BOTHER YOU THAT THAT WITNESS GOT KILLED-- THAT LADY YOU WERE SUPPOSE TO PROTECT? DOES IT UPSET YOU WHEN I ASK YOU ABOUT YOUR PAST, DETECTIVE? WHY DON'T WE JUST STAY FOCUSED ON YOU? YOU'RE UPSET, but you can't show it. JUST ANSWER MY QUESTIONS. WHY DID TONY D COME TO YOUR HOUSE THAT NIGHT? WHY DID YOUR WIFE LEAVE YOU? COUNSEL, YOU WANT TO TELL YOUR CLIENT TO QUIT PLAYING GAMES AND ANSWER MY QUESTIONS? ( whispers ) MEN LIKE TONY DON'T TALK TO WOMEN LIKE ME ABOUT BUSINESS. AND WHAT DID YOU THINK TONY'S BUSINESS WAS? DO I LOOK STUPID TO YOU, DETECTIVE? I KNEW EXACTLY WHAT TONY WAS. HE WAS GOOD TO ME AND TIMES ARE TOUGH. SO IF YOU'RE GONNA CHARGE ME WITH SOMETHING, YOU GO RIGHT AHEAD. OTHERWISE I WOULD LIKE TO LEAVE. GO AHEAD. I'M THROUGH WITH YOU FOR NOW. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. ( gasps ) OH, YOU SCARED ME. - HOW DID YOU GET IN? ( music playing ) I STILL GOT MINE. OH. FLOWERS-- OH, THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL. - HI. - HI. LET ME DO THIS FOR YOU. GO AHEAD. WAS THERE TRAFFIC? NO, IT WAS COOL. GET YOUR JACKET? ( sighs ) WOULD YOU LIKE SOME WINE? NO, SHIT. YOU KNOW, THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT A MAN IN THE KITCHEN THAT REALLY TURNS ME ON. REMEMBER WHAT WE SAID? NO, I DON'T REMEMBER. JACK. LET'S GO UPSTAIRS. HEY. JACK? YOU KNOW, YOU'D BETTER QUIT BLAMING YOURSELF. OKAY, SO YOU GOT TOO CLOSE TO A WITNESS-- NOT SMART. BUT YOU DIDN'T PULL THE TRIGGER. ARE YOU GONNA SEND ME A BILL FOR ALL THIS FREE ANALYSIS? NO, SHE KNEW IT WAS DANGEROUS TO WEAR A WIRE. SHE WANTED TO DO IT. IT WOULD PROBABLY BE BETTER IF WHEN YOU CAME HERE YOU WERE READY TO BE HERE. THE SEA LION'S GONNA GET YOU. IT'S GONNA GET YOU.

WELL, I THINK THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE THAT THEY'RE GONNA COME PAY YOU A VISIT, YEAH. WELL, I'M NOT THAT WORRIED. WELL, I JUST THOUGHT YOU MIGHT THINK IT WAS A GOOD IDEA TO HAVE A FRIEND THAT WAS A COP. WHAT EXACTLY DO YOU MEAN BY "FRIEND"? FRIEND-- I TALK, YOU TALK, THAT KIND OF STUFF. WELL, FRIENDSHIP IS SOMETHING YOU FEEL. IT'S SOMETHING IN YOUR SOUL. IT'S NOT AN EXCHANGE FOR A PAYOFF. ARE YOU STILL WATCHING ME, DETECTIVE? I THINK YOU HAVE SOMETHING A LITTLE MORE INTERESTING IN MIND THAN JUST FRIENDS. YOU KNOW, THIS-- THIS MIGHT COME AS A TOTAL SURPRISE, BUT I DON'T FIND YOUR TALL, LANKY ASS IRRESISTIBLE AT ALL. LOOK, BOYS AND GIRLS IS THE SUBJECT I'M NEVER WRONG ABOUT. ME, DO YOU?

DID IT BOTHER YOU THAT TONY DIED? I'VE SEEN A LOT OF PEOPLE DIE A LOT OF DIFFERENT WAYS. WELL, THAT'S NOT AN ANSWER. ARE YOU HAPPY THAT THEY SHOT HIM? I THINK YOUR BOYFRIEND WAS A LOW-ON-THE-FOOD-CHAIN PIECE OF SHIT AND THE WORLD IS PROBABLY BETTER OFF WITHOUT HIM. HMM. JACK VALENTINE, - A MAN OF FIRM OPINIONS. - ( clicks ) HEY, LINA. HEY, JACK.

NOW MAYBE TONY WAS GONNA FLIP STATE'S EVIDENCE, MAYBE NOT. MAYBE THAT JUST GAVE MICHAEL THE EXCUSE HE NEEDED, HUH? I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. I'M TALKING ABOUT TONY'S GIRL. MICHAEL'S DOING HER-- YOU KNOW, THE TALL ONE AT THE FUNERAL. I SAW IT WITH MY OWN EYES. YOU DON'T FIT INTO NOCERA'S VISION OF THE FAMILY ANY MORE THAN YOUR FRIEND TONY D DID.

JOEY, I COULD BE YOUR RETIREMENT PLAN. - ( phones ringing ) - ( people chattering ) NOW MICHAEL NOCERA DIDN'T ACTUALLY PULL THE TRIGGER ON TONY D, BUT HE DID MAKE IT HAPPEN.

IF YOU CAN MAKE THIS AIRTIGHT IN EIGHT DAYS, GREAT. TONY AND I GO BACK A LONG TIME. UNDERSTAND? THE GUY HAD PROBLEMS. HE WAS TURNING STATE'S EVIDENCE, JOE. YOU DID THE RIGHT THING. NOBODY'S SAYING DIFFERENT. ARE YOU FUCKING LISTENING TO ME? I'M NOT THE ONE WHO ORDERED THE HIT ON TONY D. THERE'S A WAY TO DEAL WITH PROBLEMS LIKE THIS. AND NOBODY DOES ANYTHING UNLESS I SAY SO. UNDERSTOOD? UNDERSTOOD. TONY WAS A GOOD FRIEND. HE'S A BACKDOOR STUGOTS, A POTENTIAL RAT, A FUCKING YELLOW DOG, BUT I DEAL WITH IT, NO ONE ELSE. MAYBE IT WAS CARLUCCI FROM VEGAS, HUH? YOU KNOW, SOME PEOPLE THINK I'M READY FOR A PARK BENCH. - ( chuckles ) - NOBODY THINKS THAT, JOE. WHAT ABOUT YOU, MIKEY? YOU THINK YOU'RE READY TO DRIVE THE TRUCK? NOW LET ME TELL YOU, IT'S A VERY FAST FUCKING VEHICLE. ANOTHER THING THAT BOTHERS ME-- THAT GIRL TONY D WAS GOING WITH GIVES ME A BAD FEELING, VERY BAD.

NOW YOU'RE TRYING TO PLAY ME, HUH? YOU ADD SOME VIOLINS IN THERE? TRYING TO PUSH MY BUTTONS? I GOT NO BUTTONS LEFT TO PUSH. WANT TO BET? SEE, NOW MICHAEL AND TONY-- THEY MAY LIKE ALL THIS, BUT ME-- YOU NEED TO FIND YOURSELF ANOTHER SUCKER. WHAT, ARE YOU AFRAID OF ME? YOU CAME BY HERE TO TELL ME SOMETHING. WHY DON'T YOU CUT TO THE CHASE? WHAT IF YOU DON'T LIKE WHAT YOU HEAR? LIKE WHAT YOU TOLD MICHAEL NOCERA TO GET HIM TO KILL TONY D? YOU'RE GIVING ME TOO MUCH CREDIT, JACK. THEY'RE JUST NATURAL PREDATORS. SO WHAT WOULD MICHAEL THE NATURAL PREDATOR THINK OF YOU WITH ME RIGHT NOW? IT'S OVER. HE'S IN THE PAST. WHY DON'T I BELIEVE YOU? BECAUSE YOU'RE A COP. IT'S YOUR JOB. ( phone ringing ) ( answering machine clicks ) Hi. This is Jack. Please leave a message after the beep. ( machine beeps ) Woman: Jack, I know you're there. Pick up, come on. We need to talk.

HE FOUND OUT ABOUT IT AND ICED HIM. - IT'S REAL SIMPLE. - IT WAS MICHAEL NOCERA. - REALLY? - REALLY. LOOK, ALMA ANSON IS NOT EVEN A REAL NAME. SHE IS DYING TO GIVE ME SOMETHING I CAN USE TO SQUEEZE MICHAEL NOCERA WITH. I FEEL IT. LET'S JUST GET IT ON TAPE. NOCERA WOULD SELL OUT HIS GRANDMOTHER TO AVOID GOING TO JAIL. WE PUT A LITTLE PRESSURE ON HIM, I THINK HE'D GIVE US JOE BUDDHA. YEAH. YOU KNOW, I THINK I LIKED THESE GUYS BETTER WHEN THEY HAD THE CODE OF SILENCE. ( chuckles ) NO SHIT. OKAY, I'LL GO WITH IT, BUT I WANT EVERYTHING OFFICIAL AND ON RECORD. AND I'M THE ONLY ONE WHO CUTS A DEAL. SO TELL ME A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THIS TONY FELLOW. TONY CAME INTO MY LIFE AT A TIME WHEN I REALLY NEEDED SOMEBODY. Tony was a very controlling man. He had to know where I was all the time. So he was a control freak. ( chuckles ) He was a control freak, yeah. SO YOU STARTED AN AFFAIR WITH A CONTROL FREAK'S BUSINESS PARTNER. WELL, IT WASN'T SMART, BUT I THINK YOU OF ALL PEOPLE SHOULD UNDERSTAND THAT. ( chuckles ) NO, LET'S LEAVE JACK OUT OF THIS. I'M THE LAST ONE TO PASS JUDGMENT ON ANYBODY. MM, SOUNDS LIKE THE KIND OF GUY I NEED. WHY? YOU GOT MORE TO HIDE? CURIOSITY KILLED THE CAT, JACK. BUT WHO KILLED TONY D? DID YOU TELL NOCERA THAT HE WAS GONNA TURN STATE'S EVIDENCE? DON'T BE SUCH A COP. I-- I'LL BE RIGHT BACK. ( static hissing ) JACK, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

OKAY, I'LL COME BACK FOR THE REST LATER. ( dings ) ( groaning ) ( sirens wailing ) JOE, JOE, MAN, I GOT ONE WORD FOR YOU-- ARIZONA. GET HIM INSIDE. EASY, EASY. AND THEY DIDN'T SAY WHO THEY WERE FROM? Man: NO, MA'AM. THANK YOU. HEY. HMM? WHY DON'T WE GO AWAY SOMEWHERE, GET AWAY FROM ALL THIS, START AGAIN TOGETHER, START CLEAN? AND I'M GONNA WEAR A BIG T-SHIRT SAYING "JACK THE FUCK-UP." HAVE YOU EVER BEEN TO MEXICO? NO. WE COULD FLY INTO OAXACA, SPEND A FEW WEEKS ON A BEACH AT ESCONDIDO, BUY A CAR CHEAP, DRIVE TO YUCATAN, MAYBE TRY COSTA RICA. SOUNDS NICE. MAYBE IN SOME OTHER LIFETIME. SWEETHEART, WE ONLY HAVE THIS ONE. - HEY, GEORGE. - GOOD EVENING, SIR. - SEE YOU, JOE. - GOOD NIGHT, SIR. GOOD NIGHT. ( jazz playing ) LET NOBODY SAY ME AND VINCENT EVER FORGOT A FAVOR. YOU HELPED OUT WITH THE PAROLE. WE AIN'T FORGOT. THAT'S GOOD, TOMMY, BUT WHO'S EMMA DUCKWORTH? YOU WAS ASKING AROUND ABOUT ALMA, RIGHT? SO THIS EMMA DUCKWORTH'S HER GRANDMOTHER. APPRECIATE THAT. - THANK YOU, DEAR. - YOU'RE DOING GREAT. MISS DUCKWORTH, DO YOU RECOGNIZE THIS LADY RIGHT HERE? OH, YES. THIS IS MARIAN. YOU KNOW, WHEN SHE WAS YOUNG SHE HAD A BEAUTIFUL DOLL COLLECTION AND SHE COULD PLAY WITH IT FOREVER AND EVER. AND IT WAS REALLY-- EXCUSE ME, EXCUSE ME, NOW WHAT DID YOU SAY HER NAME WAS? MARIAN HAMILTON. YES, THIS IS MARIAN. I WAS RIGHT THERE IN THE CHURCH THE DAY SHE WAS CHRISTENED. WHAT ABOUT THIS GENTLEMAN HERE? DO YOU RECOGNIZE THAT FELLOW? HMM, YES. THIS IS FRED HAMILTON-- MARIAN'S FATHER, VERY INTERESTING. HE COULD READ A BOOK THIS THICK IN A DAY. - PROLIFIC. - YEAH. WELL, LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION: IF THIS IS HER DAD, DID MARIAN SPENT ANY TIME IN AN ORPHANAGE? OH, FOR HEAVEN'S SAKES, NO. BUT SHE SPENT TWO YEARS IN A HOSPITAL. WHAT KIND OF HOSPITAL? AND SHE STILL IS A BIT UNSTABLE. POOR MARIAN, SUCH A LOVELY GIRL. ( playing piano ) I'VE BEEN TRYING TO REACH YOU ALL DAY SO I COULD FIND OUT WHAT THE GIRL SAID. BUT THEY SAID YOU TOOK A FOUR-HOUR LUNCH. AND NOW YOU EXPECT ME TO BELIEVE THAT $150,000 WORTH OF HIGH-TECH EQUIPMENT JUST STOPPED WORKING? YEAH, WELL, THESE THINGS HAPPEN. IT HAPPENED TO ME AND PHIL THE OTHER DAY IN THE VAN. - IT HAPPENED LAST YEAR. - ( phone rings ) VALENTINE. YEAH. SHIT. ( siren wailing ) AS YOU CAN SEE BEHIND ME, THE POLICE ARE COMBING THE AREA. THEY'RE STILL WAITING TO RELEASE THE IDENTITY... - WHERE IS HE? - IN THE CAR. WHAT HAPPENED? MULTIPLE STAB WOUNDS, ABOUT A DOZEN, FOR STARTERS. ( sighs ) YOU SHOULD HAVE CALLED, MICHAEL. IT'S A GAMBLE WE TOOK AND WE LOST. WHAT? JOE GOT TO NOCERA BEFORE WE COULD. THE BAD NEWS IS, WITHOUT NOCERA, THE ONLY GUY LEFT ON YOUR LIST THAT CAN CRACK THIS FAMILY OPEN IS JOE BUDDHA HIMSELF. THE GOOD NEWS IS-- RECOGNIZE THIS? IT'S ALMA ANSON'S SCARF, JACK. I SURE AM GLAD HER SLIPPERS BED. - YOU'RE EARLY. - ARE YOU COMPLAINING? - NOPE. - ALL RIGHT. KNOCK YOURSELF OUT. - STAY WARM. - ALL RIGHT, PARTNER. ( door opens and closes ) ( receding footsteps ) ( knocks on door ) ( gun clicks ) WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? WE NEED TO TALK, MARIAN. DON'T EVER CALL ME THAT. WELL, OF THESE NICE CATS, YOU SEE, THE SHORT ONE MUST BE FOR TONY D. THAT WOULD MAKE THIS ONE FOR MICHAEL NOCERA. YOU REALLY DID A JOB ON THOSE GUYS, HUH? I DIDN'T NEED TO. THEY LIVE IN A CRUEL WORLD. THEY DID IT TO THEMSELVES. SO YOU KEEP TELLING ME. WHAT'S THIS FOR? LOOK, I KNOW YOUR DAD WAS AN ACCOUNTANT FOR SEA LARK-- JOE BUDDHA'S LITTLE GAS SCAM. SO WHAT DO YOU KNOW THAT GOT THESE GUYS TO TURN ON EACH OTHER? JOE BUDDHA DOESN'T DESERVE TO LIVE AND BREATHE. WHAT DID HE DO TO YOU? HE KILLED MY FATHER. Alma: MY DAD WAS AN ACCOUNTANT, AN HONEST ONE. HE MADE THE MISTAKE OF TAKING ON THE SEA LARK BOOKS FOR JOE BUDDHA, MICHAEL NOCERA AND TONY D. BY THE TIME MY DAD REALIZED WHO HIS REAL BOSSES WERE, HE WAS IN TOO DEEP. ( gunshot ) YOU NEVER TOLD ANYBODY WHAT YOU SAW? OF COURSE I DID. YOU THINK THEY BELIEVED ME? THE COPS SAID IT WAS SUICIDE. SOMEBODY GOT PAID OFF. YOU'VE BEEN CARRYING THIS FOR 15 YEARS. YOU DON'T HAVE TO ANYMORE. DO YOU REALIZE YOU'RE PROBABLY THE ONLY LIVING WITNESS THAT'S EVER SEEN JOE BUDDHA COMMIT A MURDER HIMSELF? YOU COULD FORCE HIM TO TURN STATE'S EVIDENCE. THIS COULD BE THE BUST OF THE CENTURY. THE U.S. ATTORNEY'S OFFICE COULD HAND DOWN DOZENS OF INDICTMENTS RIGHT ACROSS THIS COUNTRY. JOE BUDDHA'S GONNA WALK? THAT'S JUSTICE ALL RIGHT. JOE BUDDHA IN WITNESS PROTECTION IS A SMALL PRICE TO PAY FOR PROSECUTIONS ON THAT SCALE. ALMA, YOU WANT TO NAIL THESE GUYS? YOU FUCKING REALLY WANT TO NAIL THEM? YOU COULD ROLL UP HIS ENTIRE FAMILY. WASTING THAT SON OF A BITCH WOULD FEEL A WHOLE LOT BETTER. YOU'RE NEVER GONNA GET NEXT TO JOE WITH A GUN, NOT NOW. YOU NEED ME TO GET TO HIM. I CAN WORK IT OUT SO THAT I'D BE THERE WITH YOU. I WOULD BE THERE TO PROTECT YOU. LIKE YOU WERE THERE WITH THAT OTHER WOMAN-- THE ONE THAT WORE THE WIRE? YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT. FORGET I ASKED. YOU WANTED TO SEE ME? ( Alma's voice ) Look, it was an incredible night, okay? Let's just leave it at that. ( Jack's voice ) We'll have a lot of nights like that. ( turns off player ) WHAT'S THE MATTER, JACK? IT GETS BETTER. YOU'RE SLEEPING WITH A KEY SUSPECT IN THE MOST IMPORTANT O.C. INVESTIGATION IN 20 YEARS. AND WHAT'S WORSE, I THINK YOU'RE PROTECTING HER. EVERYONE WHO GETS MIXED UP WITH THIS WOMAN ENDS UP ON A SLAB AT THE MORGUE. DO YOU WANT TO BE NEXT? SALLY, I-- I AM SO CLOSE TO GETTING SOMETHING. YOU KNOW, WHAT'S TRAGIC IS THAT THERE'S A PART OF ME THAT WANTS TO BELIEVE YOU. I'M GONNA HAVE TO HAVE JENNINGS TAKE YOU OFF THE CASE. AND THEN I'M GONNA HAVE TO CALL I.A.D. THERE'S GONNA BE AN INVESTIGATION. THIS IS A MESS. LISTEN, I CAN DELIVER JOE BUDDHA IN 48 HOURS, READY TO TURN STATE'S EVIDENCE. IMPOSSIBLE. IF I DON'T DO THIS, I'LL GIVE YOU MY BADGE AND MY GUN WITH PLEASURE. - HEY, MOTHERFUCKER, YOU GOT SOME 'SPLAINING TO DO. - HEY, MAN, FUCK YOU. YOU GO BEHIND MY BACK AND GIVE THOSE TAPES TO SALLY CLAIRE? WHY, PHIL? I DIDN'T TELL CLAIRE ANYTHING, ALL RIGHT? SHE ALREADY KNEW ABOUT YOU AND ALMA. IT WAS EITHER HAND OVER THE TAPES OR LOSE MY FUCKING JOB. SO YOU COULDN'T TELL ME YOURSELF? LOOK, JACK, I'M SORRY, MAN, BUT I NEED THIS JOB, YOU KNOW? I GOT A WIFE THAT DEPENDS ON ME. COME ON. I WAS GONNA TELL YOU. LOOK, YOU'D BETTER TAKE IT EASY, YOU KNOW? YOU LOSE IT AGAIN, THEY'RE NOT JUST GONNA GIVE YOU YOUR DESK JOB. THEY'RE GONNA KICK YOU OFF THE DAMN FORCE. ( knocks on door ) - YEAH? IT'S ME. OKAY, I'LL DO IT YOUR WAY. YOU WOULD HAVE LIKED MY DAD. I KNOW I WOULD HAVE. DO YOU KNOW HOW BLUE THE SKY IS IN MEXICO? HUH-UH. HOW BLUE? IT IS BLUE LIKE YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN. AND I KNOW A PLACE WHERE THE SAND ISN'T WHITE, IT'S PINK. PINK SAND? I LIKE THAT. Tommy: ...A MINIATURE STEINWAY, RIGHT? AND THE GENIE SAYS, "I'M SORRY, LADY. I THOUGHT YOU MEANT A 9" PIANIST." CUTE. TOMMY, LET ME SEE YOU. COME HERE. HEY, JACK, HOW IS IT GOING? GOOD. LET ME SEE YOU, PLEASE. EXCUSE ME, GENTLEMEN. SURE. WHAT'S HAPPENING? LISTEN, I NEED TO GET A WORD WITH JOEY B. CAN YOU HOOK THAT UP FOR ME? JESUS, JACK, FUCK. I'M GRATEFUL AND EVERYTHING, BUT YOU'RE PUTTING ME ON THE FUCKING SPOT HERE. TOMMY, ONE LITTLE CONVERSATION. PLEASE SIT DOWN. SIT DOWN. ONE LITTLE CONVERSATION, THAT'S ALL I NEED. AND YOU CAN DO THAT. YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND, DETECTIVE. TWO BIG GUYS ARE DEAD. NOBODY KNOWS WHERE JOE IS EVEN. ARE YOU SAYING HE'S SCARED? JOE? HE AIN'T BEEN SCARED IN 30 YEARS. HE'S WHAT YOU MIGHT CALL CONCERNED, ALL RIGHT, BUT-- I'M CONCERNED. EVERYBODY'S CONCERNED. I'M JUST TRYING TO GET THE MAN SOME USEFUL INFORMATION. OFFICIAL OR UNOFFICIAL? I WANT TO HAVE DINNER WITH THE GUY, COMPLETELY OFF THE RECORD. CAN YOU SET THAT UP? I CAN'T BELIEVE KEENAN AGREED TO THIS. WELL, HE DIDN'T ACTUALLY AGREE. WHAT, YOU MEAN HE DOESN'T KNOW? NO, NOT EXACTLY. WAIT, WAIT, WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU MEAN, NOT EXACTLY? KEENAN FINDS OUT THAT WE'RE RUNNING OUR OWN PERSONAL BLACK OPS HERE, HE'S GONNA SHITCAN THE BOTH OF US, GOD DAMN IT. PHIL, PHIL, LOOK, JUST WORK WITH ME ON THIS ONE, OKAY? NOW YOU'RE THE ONE THAT PIMPED ME ON THE TAPES TO SALLY CLAIRE. I PIMPED YOU? YOU'RE THE ONE THAT GOT INVOLVED WITH A WITNESS, JACK. YOU'RE THE ONE THAT'S GOT HER WEARING THE WIRE. DOES THIS SOUND FAMILIAR? PHIL, ALL YOU GOTTA DO IS SIT IN THIS LITTLE VAN, PRESS "RECORD" AND HOPE THIS SHIT WORKS. CAN YOU PLEASE DO THAT? HOW IS THIS GIRL GONNA GET JOE B TO TURN ANYWAY? LET ME WORRY ABOUT THAT, OKAY? GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE. OH, JESUS CHRIST. DETECTIVE, MY PEOPLE TELL ME YOU'RE A VERY COMPASSIONATE GUY, AN ODDBALL, BUT VERY KIND INDIVIDUAL. AND I LIKE THAT. WELL, I APPRECIATE THAT, JOE. OF COURSE YOU'RE COMPASSIONATE SO FUCKING MOPES TAKE YOU INTO THEIR CONFIDENCE. ( chuckling ) AND THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT IN YOUR LINE OF WORK. WELL, PEOPLE SKILLS CAN BE HELPFUL, YES. ( knocks on door ) ( door opens ) WHAT'S THIS, DETECTIVE? I THOUGHT WE WERE GONNA DINE ALONE. Well, Alma here is a friend of mine. She's been dying to meet you. And I think you're gonna want to hear her out. Sit down, sweetheart. Now Tommy said you had some information for me? Well, actually Alma's the one with the information. SO WHAT'S ON YOUR MIND? I HELPED MICHAEL NOCERA KILL YOUR PAL TONY D. I TOLD MICHAEL THAT YOU AND TONY WERE SKIMMING HIM ON THE GAS TAX SCAM THAT HE INVENTED. AND THEN I MADE YOU KILL NOCERA BY MAKING SURE THAT YOU KNEW THAT THE TWO OF US WERE TOGETHER. WHO IS THIS LADY? SHE'S CRAZY. MARIAN HAMILTON. YOU REMEMBER A COMPANY CALLED THE SEA LARK COMPANY, JOE? SEA LARK? SEA LARK-- THAT'S A NAME I HAVEN'T THOUGHT OF IN A LONG TIME. THAT'S BECAUSE IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME SINCE YOU KILLED FRED HAMILTON. HE WAS THE ACCOUNTANT FOR YOUR GAS STATIONS-- MY FATHER. FRED HAMILTON. HE WAS A NICE MAN. HE WAS TOO HONEST. THAT WAS HIS PROBLEM. SO YOU KILLED HIM. MARIAN HAMILTON-- EYEWITNESS TO THE MURDER OF FRED HAMILTON. NOW SHE SAW YOU KILL HER FATHER, JOE. Now you can die in jail serving out a life sentence for the murder of Fred Hamilton, OR WE CAN MAKE A DEAL. - A DEAL? - THEY'RE GONNA GET YOU SOONER OR LATER, MAN. MAKE A DEAL WITH ME NOW. IT'S GONNA BE ARIZONA OR NEW MEXICO. ( knocks on door ) ( door opens ) Man: MR. VALENTINE, YOU HAVE A PHONE CALL. Jack: NOT RIGHT NOW. Man: IT'S A MR. KEENAN, SIR. IT'S URGENT. THE F.B.I.? I THOUGHT THIS WAS UNOFFICIAL. JOE, I LIED. IT HAD TO BE THIS WAY. I'M SORRY. WE'RE WIRED. THIS PLACE IS SURROUNDED. HAD TO BE THAT WAY. DON'T DO ANYTHING STUPID. ( line beeping ) - HELLO. HELLO. - HELLO? ( gunshots ) ( people screaming ) EXCUSE ME. EXCUSE ME. COMING THROUGH. ALMA. GOD DAMN IT. - JACK. - I'M RIGHT HERE, BABY. I'M RIGHT HERE. WHAT DID YOU DO IT? I-- I DIDN'T. ( distant siren wailing ) ( Joe's voice ) The FBI? I thought this was unofficial. ( Jack's voice ) Joe, I lied. It had to be this way, I'm sorry. We're wired. This place is surrounded. Don't do anything stupid. Sweetheart, I'm sorry. I wasn't happy-- what happened to your father. ( Alma's voice ) Neither was I. ( Alma screams ) What the fuck? ( gunshots ) WAIT A MINUTE. PLAY THAT PART AGAIN AFTER SHE SAYS, "NEITHER WAS I." ( Alma screams ) What the fuck? ( gunshots ) WHAT'S THE MOMENT OF SILENCE AFTER THE FIRST SCREAM? WELL, THE D.A.D. PROBABLY CRASHED INTO THE HEADROOM. MEANING WHAT? IN ENGLISH, PHIL. WELL, ON A REGULAR ANALOG TAPE RECORDER, IF THE SOUND'S TOO LOUD, IT'LL RECORD DISTORTED. BUT WITH DIGITAL, IF THE SIGNAL'S TOO HOT, THE SOUND JUST DROPS OUT ALTOGETHER. WHY DO I HEAR THE OTHER GUNSHOTS? WELL, AFTER THE FIRST ONE I KNOCKED DOWN THE GAIN SO THE OTHER ONES WOULDN'T DROP OUT. FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH, SHE FUCKED US BOTH. ( woman speaking indistinctly ) ( continues speaking indistinctly ) THIS IS ALL THE EVIDENCE YOU GOT ON THE JOE BUDDHA CASE, RIGHT? - IT'S ALL I GOT, JACK. - OKAY. - THANKS A LOT, MAN. - I'LL SEE YOU. ( clicks ) Sweetheart, I'm sorry. I wasn't happy-- what happened to your father. Neither was I. ( Alma screams ) Phil? What the fuck? ( gunshots ) ( rewinds ) ( Alma screams ) Phil? What the fuck? ( gunshots ) PHIL? ( rewinds ) PHIL? WHAT THE FUCK? YOU JUST COULDN'T LET IT GO, COULD YOU, BUDDY? HOLY SHIT, MAN. WELL, IT'S REALLY PRETTY EASY. YOU HAD JOE COLD, WHICH MEANT YOU HAD ME AND EVERY OTHER COP ON HIS PAYROLL. I WANTED TO BRING YOU IN ON IT, JACK, SHARE THE WEALTH, YOU KNOW? YOU BROUGHT TOO MUCH ATTENTION TO YOURSELF WITH THAT GIRL, MESSED IT UP FOR EVERYBODY. WHY ME, MAN? WHAT WOULD MAKE YOU THINK I'D DO THIS? I FIGURED IF ANYBODY COULD USE A LITTLE EXTRA INCOME, IT'D BE YOU. A COUPLE HUNDRED DOLLARS A WEEK TO PUT YOUR LIFE ON THE LINE-- IT'S A LOUSY GIG, JACK. WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO NOW, PARTNER? ARE YOU GONNA TAKE ME OUT RIGHT HERE? I DON'T KNOW. A GUY GOT FIRED, WENT POSTAL. THANK GOD THAT BRAVE OFFICER WAS THERE TO TAKE HIM OUT BEFORE HE BLASTED HIS WAY THROUGH THE WHOLE STATION. BACK ME UP. BACK ME UP. - Jack: FREEZE! - ( men yelling ) PUT THE RECORDER DOWN. HE'S DESTROYING STATE'S EVIDENCE. - FOR CHRISSAKE, TAKE HIM OUT. - NO, HE'S A FUCKING MOLE. HE'S ON BUDDHA'S PAYROLL. PUT IT DOWN, PHIL. PUT THE TAPE RECORDER DOWN, MAN. PUT IT DOWN. I'LL PUT MY WEAPON DOWN. PUT IT DOWN. PUT IT DOWN, PHIL! PUT IT DOWN. ( people chattering ) ( siren wailing ) ( police radio chatter ) ( camera shutters clicking ) GET THAT CAR OUT OF THE WAY. GET OUT OF HERE. COME ON. OH MY GOD. EXCUSE ME. I'M SALLY CLAIRE WITH THE U.S. ATTORNEY'S OFFICE. - IS HE GONNA BE OKAY? - HE'S SHOT UP PRETTY BADLY. JACK, IT'S SALLY. PHIL DIDN'T MAKE IT. AND I HEARD THE TAPE. YOU WERE RIGHT TO TRUST ALMA. - GO AHEAD. - Man #1: WATCH IT. - Man #2: GOT HIM. - Man #1: LET'S GO. ( siren wailing ) ( rustling ) ( Alma's voice ) "JACK, IF YOU'RE READING THIS, I'M NOT AROUND ANYMORE. LIKE I SAID, YOU WOULD HAVE LIKED MY DAD. HERE'S SOMETHING HE LEFT ME A LONG TIME AGO. I WANTED YOU TO HAVE IT. THE BOOKS SHOW A TRAIL OF NUMBERS THAT WILL LEAD YOU TO THE BOSSES IN NEW YORK AND KANSAS CITY. MAYBE IT'LL HELP. MAKE SURE YOU GO, JACK, FOR THE BOTH OF US. LOVE, MARIAN."
