Why does it begin, this quest to understand the unexplainable? For some it's later in life long after the wide-eyed optimism of youth has left them and they believe the answers to all life's mysteries are easily found in the mundane. Maybe something happens to challenge their earth-bound assumptions and they're compelled to discover what really happened. But some fall into the mysterious at a young age and truly believe they can seek out new discoveries, new frontiers. Some no longer question whether these boundaries even exist or new revelations wait to be uncovered. They know that the universe still keeps some secrets. They know because they've heard the eyewitness stories, the accounts from good, honest people of things that defy explanation. Or maybe they simply know because in their search for legends, they've seen one for themselves. We see this blood smear on the road. There was just a tremendous amount of blood. We see off in the distance this shadow, large, black, sorta hunched over figure. The thing turns and we realize it's not a person. Over the weekend It's this bird. out by this ranch in the middle of nowhere. A large bird flying in circles like the size of a single engine airplane. Driving and all of a sudden they said, "Oh my God." Came into my bed. And he immediately woke up I looked over and there was and catched and there was a glimpse of this a huge bird there, giant black bird. so massive it could take up the whole window. Largest bird I've ever seen in my entire life. In the news today, yet another sighting of the infamous Chicago Mothman. The Tribune is covering this latest what they're calling flap about sightings of this giant winged demonic thing people are seeing right here in downtown Chicaco. A woman walking her dog claimed she encountered a creature standing in the park. "I saw a large man probably seven feet or taller "standing on the ground," according to the account published by Strickler. "It was solid black." In 2017, sightings of a giant flying creature begin taking place around the city of Chicago. While the being seen by many Chicagoans was said to be simply an abnormally large bird, the media soon dubbed it the Chicago Mothman in reference to a similar phantom seen in the skies above Point Pleasant, West Virginia, in 1966 and 1967. But what really stood out were the large, and I do mean large, pair of wings. While the Chicago sightings drew the attention of local and national media, unusual occurrences were nothing new to paranormal researchers familiar with the Prairie State. We'll keep following this story in the days ahead no doubt so keep it tuned right here to 97.1, The Lake. I began in cryptozoology in the late '50s and one of the first things that I investigated was a report of a black panther. And I went out with a game warden and I musta been 12 years old. They found tracks, they interviewed the individual who said they saw a panther-like creature, got back in the truck with the game warden and he said, "They just saw a beaver." And that kind of made me know what I was getting into that most people don't believe these things, they don't really listen to witnesses. They go in with a pre-conceived notion and I wanted to be more open-minded and that's what I started doing. My name is Troy Taylor and I was born and raised in Illinois. I have lived all over the state of Illinois. Currently I live in Jacksonville, Illinois. My sole interest beginning in anything that wasn't ghosts was because I read Loren Coleman's book Mysterious America when I was in high school. The thing I loved about it the most is that so many of his stories were based in Illinois and I didn't know why till I saw an article about him in our local paper and realized he was from Decatur, too. You know, it was Loren who put me on the path of well, you know, there's a lotta cool stuff in Illinois. I rarely meet people who don't either know someone or have a family member who had some sort of encounter in their life, in their entire lifetime. Even if they don't believe in this kinda stuff, these things tend to happen or are drawn to people. And I think that that seems to make Illinois more haunted than other states but I don't think that's the case. I think they're all very haunted or all drawn to the paranormal. It's just somebody's gotta write this stuff down. Somebody's gotta collect it. I grew up in Illinois. I lived in Illinois most of my life from 1947 through 1975. And I really saw Illinois as a little United States. The state of Illinois is a lot bigger than people think. You try to drive tip to tip in Illinois, it's about an eight-hour drive. You have the urban area in Chicago, then the river area in the northern part of the state. You've got Chicago, you've got a big metropolitan area. In Northern Illinois, you have the Illinois River and all the bluffs and the wooded areas and the canyons. And then you get into the middle of the state where everything's flat. There just isn't a lot geographically across the middle of the state that's unusual. To me there's nothing more beautiful than driving across that flat land and seeing a thunderstorm come toward you. But when you travel further south, then you get into a whole different area. Once you get to the southern part of the state, you will swear you have left Illinois. And then southern Illinois, Little Egypt, is a whole different country. It's like a little swampy land, there's rolling hills. This is the edge of the Ozarks and there are mountains and hills and canyons and rivers and it's a wild region. And you find that a lot of these strange anomalous animal sightings all seem to come to the southern part of the state. And then along the western edge, you have the Mississippi River which is completely different again. The town of Alton, Illinois, sits on the banks of the Mississippi at the confluence of the Illinois, the Mississippi, and the Missouri Rivers. Situated in the furthest reaches of the state, it's an often overlooked destination with a rich history that defines it as one of the most important pieces of a century-old puzzle. Alton was founded in 1818 and, despite its considerably smaller size, was conceived as a sister city to St. Louis. The region was once home to Native Americans who had called southern Illinois home for centuries prior to the arrival of European settlers. Naturally, the incursion into the Midwest caused a number of skirmishes between the local natives and the outsiders. Over time, Alton became incredibly important to Illinois' economy as it grew into an industrial hub thanks to its location along the river. This was the start of a town that's had a lot of odd things drawn to it over the years. It's a town that's plagued by stories of ghosts and hauntings and strange creatures and that dates back to really the beginning. It's a place where there's been a lotta death, there's been diseases, there's been flooding. There was a Civil War prison located there. And it's become known as one of the most haunted small towns in America because of all the history that's taken place there. Alton's geographical location places it in a historically significant region known as the Gateway to the West. As Lewis and Clark began their journey across the United States in 1804, the current location of Alton would've been an area they traveled through during the early days of the western expansion. While Alton has a noteworthy role in history, it hasn't always been a positive one. At the Confederate prison located in Alton, the Union Army kept as many as 12,000 soldiers captive in horrifying conditions that led to disease and death. In the years to follow, the mighty Mississippi would overflow its banks on multiple occasions resulting in catastrophic flooding. For followers of the strange and unusual, these aspects of the town's history might ring strangely familiar. So I find a lot of connections between Alton as a river community and other river communities across the country like Point Pleasant in West Virginia. It's got the same type of history in that you've got Native Americans, you've got bloodshed, you've got diseases, and you've got this great history. Point Pleasant is also one of those towns that, not only has a haunted history, but also has, of course, the Mothman legend connected to it. So you've go the Piasa Bird in one place, you've got the Mothman in the other, and all of this energy drawn to these towns with all this water. And I think any time you have a river community you're gonna have more stories. You're gonna have more ghost stories, you're gonna have more weird encounters, you're gonna have more strange legends. For many years people have been discussing something known as the Piasa which allegedly is an Illinois Native American Thunderbird creature. There's a long history and story behind this creature. It first appears in the work of a Jesuit missionary name Jacques Marquette. And in 1673 he was exploring the Mississippi River and he saw these giant pictographs, these rock paintings on the side of cliffs. Dating even further back than before the city actually started was when Marquette and Joliet came down the Mississippi River in 1673 and claimed the entire region for France. They'd already been primed for weird things in Illinois. Well, they come around a curve in the river near what's now Alton and painted on the side of the bluff is two renditions of this monster. The Illini Indians used the word Piasa as the bird that would devour humans. And the whole story was that the Piasa Bird would come down and eat people or that some of the tribal groups had to, in some ways, give a sacrifice of young people to the Piasa Birds. One of the major chiefs decided enough was enough. I don't wanna do this anymore. I'm losing a lot of my people so he actually went on one of the cliffs where the sacrifice was given and when the Piasa Bird came down, he had 11 warriors come out and kill it. That story's really come down as the creation story, so to speak, of the Piasa Bird. There's always been a question as to whether or not the Piasa Bird was a true story or not. Of course the Native Americans claimed it was. And after they painted that mural, as they passed it on the Mississippi River, they would fire arrows at it, they would fire rifles at it, they would blow tobacco smoke at it, all in tribute to its ferocity. In the 1830s, a professor at Shurtleff College in Alton, Illinois, wrote an article about the Piasa. And he claimed that the Illini people told him that these creatures were actually giant birds and that the name literally meant the bird that devours men. And in 1836, he went looking for what he had heard was a cave that was connected to the Piasa Bird in some way. He hired a young man to take him up into the bluffs. They spent the entire day hunting for this cave. And after climbing up the sheer face of one of the cliffs, they entered a cave. And as they walked inside, he said he could hear the sound of something crunching under his feet. And when he lit a torch to see what it was, he discovered that he was in a cave completely filled with human bones. This was allegedly the Piasa cave. This is where the bird was taking its victims, and eating them, and leaving its bones behind. The problem is is that no one else has ever found this cave. Researchers have uncovered the fact that this article was probably highly fictionalized and that he took a lot of physical embellishment because the original Piasa creatures, the pictographs did not display wings at all. There were some people who even criticized the fact that it had wings and Marquette and Joliet didn't make a note of that. Well, it turns out that there really were wings but they were usually only visible when the bluffs were wet. The original Piasa Bird mural was eventually destroyed in the mid-1800s but was recreated again in the 1870s by Professor William McAdams. This recreation was based on descriptions of the lost mural by local settlers. The supposed cave containing the bones of the Piasa Bird victims was never found. And whether or not the Piasa Bird was even a winged cryptid, remains a debate among historians and researchers. One thing is sure, however, Alton, Illinois, was a town that seemed to be a magnet for the unusual. Really from the 1700s, there started to be documentation in this record that certain people who were explorers, who were colonists, who were native peoples were seeing large birds. And they would often see them on the top of mountains, on bald mountains, in caves, in different things like that. They didn't wanna get too close to them but they certainly knew they had to deal with these things. Accounts of giant monstrous birds actually date back decades. Even into the 19th century you have accounts as old as the 1860s. In 1868 in Missouri, there was a group of children out playing at school. The school teacher came out and saw this huge bird swoop down, grab ahold of a boy and literally carry him away and disappear. Apparently it was well-documented and it probably happened. And these sightings tend to occur in flaps, that is clusters, many clusters of sightings in a concentrated area. There was a big, what they call, a flap around the Alton area in the 1940s. And people were seeing these large birds in the skies and didn't really know what they were. People were calling them Thunderbirds because, of course, that's the Native American name for 'em and what they traditionally called. But in the 1940s around Alton and spreading out even into Springfield and up to the northern state of Wisconsin, people were seeing these giant bird-like creatures. And you can actually follow some of the paths of these creatures by following the newspaper accounts that each town the night after would report people seeing these. In the small town of Alton, strange flying creatures are making a merry mess of the panicked masses as more and more reports flood in. Where do these bizarre beaked bearers of bad luck originate? Are they giant birds or mere mass hysteria? You be the judge. In early April of 1948, there began to be sightings around Alto of some sort of giant bird. And everyone described it about the same. It was gray. I find with all these sightings the wingspans seemed to kind of vary a little but not much. The fact that they were all so close I thought was impressive. When I was a very young boy and getting into this, I discovered that microfiche and microfilm in libraries, you could look through old records. And found all of these stories from 1948 that nobody had discovered. And I found one story in April when the whole big flap in 1948 began. I found probably the most convincing of all of those sightings were a couple of retired military guys one of which was the head of the Western Military Academy which was in Alton at the time. And the first that we're familiar with goes back to April of 1948. And the first may in fact have been a army colonel name Walter Sigmund who was standing at an airbase talking to another colonel and a farmer and he claimed he looked up and saw this, what he thought at first was an airplane flying overhead until he saw this thing flap its wings. And at that point he realized that this thing was an airplane-sized bird literally. In April of 1948, the St. Louis Dispatch ran an eyewitness account told to a mother and father by their young son. The boy had spied what he claimed to be a giant grayish-green bird over their home in Overland just 25 miles south of Alton in January of the same year. The family was initially hesitant to come forward with their story. However, as the Sigmund account found its way into area newspapers, suddenly other witnesses who had seen giant birds felt compelled to add their own reports to the public record. Alongside the Walter Sigmund sighting was another one from April 9th, 1948. In this case, Mr. and Mrs. Robert Price of Caledonia, Illinois, describe seeing a monstrous bird bigger than an airplane. They reported seeing enormous wings and what they took to be massive legs and feet beneath it. On April 10th, the winged monstrosity appeared again in the sky above Overland, observed by a couple and their acquaintance as it soared over their home. Their initial assumption was that they were witnessing an airplane maneuvering through the sky. There was a truck driver named Verle Babb who was driving one morning and claimed that he saw this thing, a giant bird swooping down trying to pick up a small piglet at a pig farm. There's a famous account from a lady doctor in Alton, Illinois, who claims she looked out her window and saw a Thunderbird flying by. She said that it looked like a Piper Cub. A bird, no, a airplane. She thought it was that huge. And people started saying maybe we should pay attention. And there was also a sighting of a farmer and his wife, a man named Charles Pierce who claimed that they saw this monster-sized bird. Now, most of the descriptions were very similar and people were describing literally an airplane-sized bird with a wingspan perhaps 20 feet, 25 feet across. And this went on for a few weeks until around the end of the month. It also showed up across the river in St. Louis. Sightings on the Missouri side of the Mississippi River were covered with greater intensity than the Alton sightings given their closer proximity to the bustling city of St. Louis. The St. Louis Dispatch recounted sightings of an airplane-sized gray-black bird seen all over the region during the two-week span. One of the most memorable giant bird sightings took place on April 26th. This involved a group of flight instructors at the Mississippi School of Aeronautics in St. Louis who spotted an abnormally large bird flying at nearly 1200 above the airstrip. On April 27th, salesman Harry Bradford was driving down the Red Feather Highway in the late afternoon when he spotted something huge flying above him. He pulled to the side of the road and shined a spotlight into the sky. Using the light, he could positively identify it as a strangely massive bird. In the days to follow, he would claim to have three more sightings of the very same creature. Things took an even stranger turn when three St. Louis locals saw what they described as a Piper Cub-sized bird in the night sky around 10 p.m. They recalled seeing it flap its wings and move unusually fast through the darkness at an altitude of perhaps 3000 feet. Most unusual was the fact that the creature seemed to be illuminated by a dull glow emanating from within its body. The hysteria surrounding the bird sightings reached a feverish pitch when the Civil Air Patrol offered to make aerial searches for the bird which was now making national news. One of the most entertaining parts of this flap of sightings was that the mayor of Alton kept getting all these letters from people demanding that he do something about this bird because for all they knew it was gonna eat people like the Piasa Bird. And so he put his assistant in charge of trying to track down this creature and trap it. Then the mayor got involved and a heron was caught and tracks were found on the mud bank. It kinda got to be a media event and became what we call nine day wonder because it really was in the newspaper nine days. But in those nine days, people talked about several months of reports. But it seemed as soon as public interest in it peaked, it just stopped. Wherever this thing went it moved on somewhere else. It moved on, the people forgot about it, and they went back to living. So what was it that people saw in 1948 and does it have any historical precedents? While there are occasional accounts of large bird sightings around the Prairie State, they aren't exactly common and when they do come, it's in waves. It would be odd for some sort of natural animal to only occasionally travel to a geographical region. Perhaps the answers as to what people were seeing in Alton in those days dwells within the pages of history. One of the most compelling lines of evidence with regard to quote unquote Thunderbirds is that you have so many widespread Native American legends that refer to these monstrous eagles or Thunderbirds, giant birds. These Native American Thunderbird accounts range from the Pacific Northwest to the Southwest, the Great Plains, New England, and so on and so forth. So isn't it interesting that we have all of these widespread different cultures that refer to identical animals. Many saw this as, again, bad luck, an omen, that these creatures would show up and you did not want to see them. Many cultures are even hesitant to say the name of these creatures with the belief that even mentioning them is enough to put you on their radar. One of the things that Thunderbirds are often depicted doing is shooting lightning from their beaks or their eyes or their head. They're very closely associated, almost in an elemental aspect, with thunder and storms. These giant birds are associated with storm fronts that the beating of their wings sounds like thunder. I know there may be a scientific reason behind this if we consider that large birds could take advantage of the thermal updrafts that are at the forefront of storms and that perhaps it helps them fly and so forth. It's difficult to define just where central Illinois begins but for many the flat endless acres of corn, wheat, and soybean fields define the Prairie State. Here among the ruins of the once-vibrant homes and businesses, small pockets of civilization have managed to survive among the decline of agriculture and industry. Imagine a Midwest once alive and booming. These small towns situated along old highways which today are shells of their former glory were once micro-cities. Dance halls, grocery stores, bars, and nightlife were just around every corner. Lawndale was no different. Lawndale, Illinois, is a quiet town in Logan County, Central Illinois. Nothing much ever happens there. Lawndale, Illinois, is located actually right off Interstate 55. It is a little north of Lincoln. It's not easy to find on a map because it's a very small town. I believe the population is less than a thousand. It's just a ordinary little community on the side of the road. I can't give you anything famous about it because as far as I'm concerned the only really famous thing that ever happened there was the July 25th, 1977, attack by a Thunderbird. Nearly 30 years had passed since the Thunderbird wave had swept across southern Illinois in 1948. While occasional sightings of large birds in Illinois were still reported, giant, winged cryptids had long since been forgotten. Despite the tales of small children being carried away by Thunderbirds in Missouri, kids were free to play outside at all hours of the day and rarely looked to the sky with any sense of fear. All that would change for one Lawndale family on July 25th, 1977. At 8:00 in the evening of July 25th, 1977, in Lawndale, Logan County, Illinois, a young 10-year-old boy named Marlon Lowe was playing hide-and-seek with two of his buddies, Travis Goodwin and Michael Thompson. They were in his backyard while his mother, his parents, and some of their family friends were cleaning out a trailer on their property. The trailer that had little black eagles on it. And these three boys were kinda playing hide-and-seek around the front yard. And right behind them is Kickapoo Creek. And all of a sudden flying down Kickapoo Creek was two giant birds swooping down. These two huge birds fly down over the yard, try to pick up one of the boys who dives to safety Look out! into a plastic wading pool and narrowly misses becoming infamous like Marlon Lowe became. Marlon began to run away. He weighed about 56 pounds at the time. He was kind of a small boy. But according to all the witnesses that were present one of these two birds swooped down. He gets caught by the talons of one of the birds. It was two birds but only one of them got him. Picks him up, carries him about 50 feet across the yard. The bird turns, grabs ahold of this kid by the back of the shirt and picks him up off the ground. Well, as these boys are screaming, Marlon's mother Ruth runs to the back of the house to see what's going on and sees this bird pick her son up three feet off the ground and carry him about 10 yards across the backyard of their house. Oh help! As Marlon was kicking and fighting until the bird finally just dropped him and let him go. And then the two birds kind of took off flew underneath Oh honey, are you okay? Are you okay? a electric wire right over the trailer home. Are you okay, honey? Attempted to roost in a large tree in their property but according to the witnesses they were having trouble roosting in this tree 'cause they were too big and then they took off towards Kickapoo Creek to the north. Saw these birds fly away off toward a wooded area at the edge of town. They called the police. They needed some kind of validation. And they also thought if this can happen to one kid, it can happen to other kids. And there had been stories about around that time of dog disappearing, of certain little lambs and other livestock. So there was becoming a hint that something sinister was happening. When I was a kid, I'd never heard of anything like this before. And suddenly these people had had an encounter with something that you couldn't even wrap your head around. I don't think anybody could. Other things started happening, other things that were psychological that happened to that family because they weren't ready for what impact this was gonna have on their lives. Again, it's one of those things why would you make a story like this up? It makes no sense as to why you would invent something like this. It affected the family so much that for many years they wouldn't talk to anybody. Marlon, according to his mother, didn't sleep for nights afterward. They were being teased and harassed by neighbors and people from anywhere that would show up at their house, leave dead birds on their sidewalk. They started calling Marlon the Bird Boy. But it made the papers and people talked about it, people laughed about it, but the Lowes swore it was true. They swore that it happened. Wasn't until a couple years later that I went out to Illinois to interview the family all over again. And what struck me was how Marlo Lowe really was affected by this. Kids had started calling him the Bird Boy. They started killing birds and leaving dead birds on their porch. And he had bright red hair when he was littler, when he was 10 years old, and here he was two years later, gray hair. The Lowes described these two birds as looking very much like Andean condors. They said that they were all black, that they had a hooked beak, but they actually had a white waft of feathers around their neck. Then beyond that, you've got all of these other people then for the next several months seeing one or two birds exactly like the Lowes described. The Lawndale incident was such big news that it really put the Thunderbirds back into the headlines. It was essentially the first sighting of that time period although there may have been a couple of, like a week before that a woman nearby in Lincoln, Illinois, claimed that she had also seen these Thunderbirds. So as often happens in these cases, there's that one big incident that really gets all the publicity and that creates an environment where other eyewitnesses feel a little bit more comfortable coming out of the shadows and saying you know what, I saw those things, too. I just didn't wanna talk about it. They talked about a trailer court couple communities over. A big, giant bird landed on the trailer and then took off. Someplace else in the county somebody else was seeing it. And you started hearing these reports very casually at first then in the media. Then the Chicago media got involved, then the television media, and it became a traditional flap. In the days following the Lowe incident, the giant birds were seen repeatedly many times as a pair occasionally glimpsed alone. On July 28th, the Thompsons spotted a massive bird flying above their farm in McLean County just to the north of Lawndale. The creature had a wingspan of at least 10 feet and the couple and their visiting friends would soon recount their sighting to local police. Later the same day, a mail carrier spotted two birds matching the same description as those in the Lowe incident in Bloomington, Illinois, just 25 miles north of Lawndale. He witnessed one of the birds soar into a nearby field where it snatched up a pig and flew off as the poor animal struggled in its massive talons. The incident left the man shaken and convinced that what he'd seen was a huge condor. Also on the 28th, Lisa Montgomery was washing her car when she spied a lone bird in the sky above Tremont. She described the wingspan as being 10 feet or more. Two more sightings drew national media attention on July 30th. The first of these occurred when Denise Turner of Downs, Illinois, and two friends saw a huge bird perched on a telephone pole alongside an intersection. The witness described seeing the creature's talons unfurl and drop something to the ground which was later identified by local police as a footlong rat. At 2 p.m. that same day multiple residents of Waynesville, Illinois, reported seeing a massive bird soar overhead. In the midst of all of the Lawndale reports and the other reports from around central Illinois, a gentleman showed up calling himself Texas John. And in Shelbyville, which is a little bit further to the west of Lawndale, Texas John said, "I shot some footage of Thunderbirds." And he went to Champaign, Illinois, TV station, showed 'em the footage, they showed it to me, and everybody was interested in it. And he had heard about these Thunderbird sightings and he has a Cherokee lineage so he certainly believed in the Thunderbird. And he was in his boat on the north side of the lake when he suddenly saw these two enormous birds perched in a tree. And he knew that these birds were extraordinary. So what he did was he blew the horn on his boat in order to scare them to get them to take off on these trees and then he began to film as they flew off. To me and to a lot of researchers it looked like turkey vultures sitting in a tree and then taking off. A number of wildlife experts have looked at it and dismissed these two birds as simply turkey vultures which are very common in Illinois. Turkey vultures can be extremely large-looking. But I've looked at the film quite a bit through the years, analyzed it, and at least in my own mind, one of the two birds is much, much larger than any turkey vulture and really appears to have the proportions of a bird like a condor with a wingspan perhaps nine feet across. In December of 1977, there was a report, and it mostly showed up in news reports, we never get to the bottom of it, a group of men were going along a road and they saw a giant bird. They shot it. They got very scared and they burned the body. And they felt that they'd done something wrong and illegal. And that often happens in those kind of shooting stories 'cause you never see the bodies. People burn them. In the weeks that followed, occasional reports of abnormally large birds continued to trickle in around central Illinois. However, like the Alton Thunderbird wave of 1948, eventually the reports simply stopped. The birds had disappeared yet sightings continued of strange things in the skies. Loren Coleman and his brother Jerry would investigate numerous winged cryptid sightings in the years that followed the Lawndale incidents, not all of them mere birds. When I'm involved in investigating cryptozoology, I usually try to categorize the branches that I'm going down. And one large branch is what I call winged weirdies. And in that file of winged weirdies, there's flying humans, there's big owls, there's big birds, there's pterodactyls, there's all kinds of different reports. And you have to look at them as best you can just make them all kind of go together. When investigating giant winged cryptids, it all becomes very confusing. There's a lot of gray area. And in my research, which has spanned decades, I typically get three types of reports or accounts. But for example, we have the sightings of the giant birds, the Thunderbirds, which people always describe as having feathers. I get a second type of people describing something more quote unquote prehistoric. And then you get people that report more the flying dinosaurs, the pterodactyls, something out of prehistoric times. And then you also have many accounts of what we call flying humanoids, creatures that are composites or anthropomorphic creatures with human-like characteristics, bodies, sturdy legs, arms, heads, but also wings attached to their body. It was still cold out and it was late and I was possibly driving slightly faster than I should be. As I came up Route 51 where this turnoff is to go to the lake there's a sign and like a light, pole light. So as I'm coming down, you know, it's pretty late, but I notice a man standing along the road. It looked like a man in a trench coat. And I'm pretty sure that there's so much road kill around there it was eating something alongside the road. As I came up on it, it was, I thought it was a man because it was man height. It was, you know, five plus feet, six foot tall. Very dark, with headlights on it it looked dark gray. I bet it was black. As it opened up and I saw, you could see the wings, feathers, you could see what it was. There was a little bit of light, like my headlights were showing a little bit lighter color than that. It was the size of a man. And I saw the wings come up and take off and he was standing on the white line on the edge of the road. And when it went like this, the wing broke center line of the road which was just like what the heck? And I kinda, as it went up, I kinda went under. It was very startling because it was, I thought it was a guy. And when it took off, it was almost exciting. I think I turned around and went back to my house and woke my brother up and told him. Shortly after that, around two weeks, 15 minutes from my house in a small town called Herrick, there was another sighting that was very similar to I what I seen. So it kinda helped me, you know, you always get that, did that happen? Or as with everything you try to rationalize what was it? Was it too close or too, you know, but having that same description, same size, that close to home that soon after, was kinda like yeah there was something around there at that point. It was a mid-December day. It was in the '90s, I think '94. My friend and I were going out pheasant hunting and it was a real cold, windy, blustery winter day. We'd stopped at the guy's place where we were going hunting. We asked if we could go and we were hunting a ditch out in Caybury, Illinois. That's where we were at. Our dogs, we had German Shorthaired Pointer dogs and we were watching them hunt. So the dogs were down in the ditch. My friend yelled, "Look!" And I looked over at him, he was to my left. Look! And I saw him pointing above me. I'd never saw it. And I looked up and there was a massive bird right over the top of our dogs. He later said that he thought that that bird was coming after our dogs and that made sense to me because it was right above us. It was black and it was probably, a good guess is the wingspan was 20 feet. I noticed that the wings were really long and they had one bend in the middle. I distinctly saw that. And its head, it had a very long beak and had kind of a long head, a very big head, long beak, and like it seemed like almost like its head went back behind it, too. The bird, as soon as he yelled, "Look," and it heard us and saw us, it took a couple flaps and went up and got up into the sky and that wind just, and it was just gone. It was gone outta sight in a minute, not even a minute. We both walked over to each other and we're like what did you just see? And we both have talked about it a lot since. I'm a lifelong outdoorsman, I've spent my life out in the outdoors. I've never seen anything like this. My boss used to say, you know, "Danhausen, tell that crazy bird story of yours." It was kinda something we told as it was funny to people. And it wasn't for years that I actually figured out or later discovered that other people had seen these birds. It's been a source of laughter for people for quite some time. Thunderbirds, winged humanoids, prehistoric remnants, is there any reason why rational, skeptical people would believe these things exist? The Teratorn was a massive bird that, as strange as it sounds, does match descriptions given by many of the witnesses particularly when it pertains to wingspan and the white plumage around the creature's neck. The skeletal remains of Teratorns with wingspans up to 20 feet have been discovered in much of the United States. Yet science claims that these creatures went extinct millions of years ago. The Thunderbirds, which are all over the West and a little bit in the Midwest, look like Teratorns. They seem to be giant ancient condors. And they were catharaforms. They were essentially the ancestors of modern condors and vultures. A lot of people believe that these giant birds that are seen that don't really match the description of known birds might be some kind of prehistoric winged creature, winged bird. I don't know. I mean, I would think we would see them more often if they were just living out there roosting somewhere. I think we'd see them more often than we do. Is there something paranormal about these things? Are they sort of projections from the past perhaps of extinct species or time slips or something? And then you hear of reports of other even stranger things like lights emitting from these creatures, which of course, a normal bird can't do. I've always wondered if there might be some sort of at least a paranormal thing behind winged creatures. I mean, I think there might be some sort of dimensional question there. A lot of sightings people will think it's just a gigantic bird, something flesh and blood that you could hunt, you could kill if you had to. But then there are other accounts whether it's UFO-related or other phenomenon where people believe the creature's exhibiting supernatural abilities. But yes, there is a notion that any of these winged creatures could represent tragic or catastrophic events to come, that they could be omens, warnings, of dire events. Course we have the connection between the famous Mothman and the tragedy of the Silver Bridge collapse. Many people connect those two things in their minds. There is certainly a notion that these winged cryptids, creatures, whatever you wanna call them are essentially very negative things that you do not want to encounter. Northern Illinois is defined by the state's largest metropolitan area, the city of Chicago. Yet, outside the sprawl of Chicagoland, lies large pockets of forest, vast rolling fields, and the Illinois River. In addition to miles of undeveloped prairie, this stretch of the state is also home to two other large cities and acres and acres of swamps and farmland. It's a remarkable Midwestern mix of uninhabited expanses and densely populated areas. The city of Chicago was built on a swamp essentially. The beginning of its history began with bloodshed. This was a place where settlers were massacred by the local Native American tribes at the beginning of the War of 1812. And so it already was off to a bad start. It took almost 20 years to really develop after that massacre took place. But Chicago, thanks to all of the people and the energy there, its history has created it's ghosts. I don't think that it's the location of Chicago that makes it so strange. I think it's all of the things that have happened there over the years. Because you have had the great fire in 1871. You've had millions of people come through what's essentially downtown Chicago in the last, oh not even quite 200 years. I mean, you name it, it's had all of this very violent history and it think that's really left a mark behind. My name is Tobias Wayland and I am the head writer and editor for the Singular Fortean Society. I began my career investigating the breadth of paranormal phenomena in the true Fortean fashion of not leaving anything uninvestigated. In August of 2016, the winged cryptid phenomenon returned to Illinois. This time to the city of Chicago. As reported to Lon Strickler, a woman was wandering down Roosevelt Road in the suburb of Cicero when she noticed a flash of movement between two buildings. Upon straining to see what it was that had caught her attention, she noticed a large humanoid figure perched on top of a streetlight. The thing shot into the air and disappeared into the night. In February of 2017, the flying, manlike creature was spotted again by a motorist traveling down 294 south outside of Chicago. The driver recalled seeing a manlike shape running beside the road before suddenly unfurling two wings and taking to the skies over the city. The man was shaken as he recalled observing what he described as the biggest bird he had ever seen. In March, a third sighting took place in Tinley Park. This time a man and his dog encountered a being matching the same description as the previous two sightings. It peered at him from a nearby roof. The man attempted to get a better view of the creature by approaching it but it took to the sky and disappeared before he could capture a photo. The initial reports of the Chicago Mothman or Chicago Phantom were reported to the paranormal websites Phantoms & Monsters operated by investigator and author, Lon Strickler, and UFO Clearinghouse operated by Manuel Navarette. In early May of 2017, I had seen three reports come through the MUFON database. And they each described a bat or bird-like being. And you know, as a paranormal researcher, journalist, investigator, it piqued my interest and so I wrote a short article about it for our site. I was following it. I noticed that more reports kept coming in. In 2017, I became aware that there was seemingly a flap of flying humanoid sightings coming out of Chicago and I was like what is happening. I was familiar, of course, with John Keel and with the Mothman sightings in Point Pleasant, West Virginia, from 1966 to 1967. So I was like, could it be that Mothman is now pretty much in my neighborhood? More sightings kept coming in. Almost immediately after in late April and early May you had two sightings near the Little Calument River. And so both of those were men out fishing with their sons. In the first instance, on April 27th, the witness said that he heard a sound like train brakes as a train slows down like the sound of its brakes. Just after that he saw what he described as a giant bat fly overhead. The second sighting was very, very similar in that area. I don't believe that he mentioned the same shrill noise. Saw a giant bat. But in both cases they described it as being very large, you know, seven to eight-foot wingspan. The Chicago Mothman case is really interesting. It started about a year, year and a half ago and there was a huge rash of sightings. I think upwards of 70 to 80 sightings by now. Right now, according to internet sources, there have been 71 sightings. 2011, 2017 was the bulk of them and then a few in 2018. Lon Strickler who published the very first accounts, knowing that I had an interest in the specific subject was gracious enough to funnel me each individual sighting or account for me to review. And I did review and go through the eyewitness testimonies. And initially the descriptions seemed very similar to other flying humanoids that have been documented in Point Pleasant, West Virginia, and other places. A creature with quote unquote bat-like wings and other human-like features. I have several criticisms of the Chicago phenomena. For one thing, to call it Mothman, I thought was pure and simple the copycat phenomena. People were seeing things in the sky or things near the Earth that were above them. Some of them looked like kites. Some of them looked like balloons, winged creatures, ravens. And somebody decided to label those Mothman. And I think the problem started then. And it was all still very much up in the air. You know, obviously, there was people comparing it to Mothman. There were people who thought it could be a Halloween costume on a drone. Some people thought that we're dealing with a skydiver in a wing suit. So I've been investigating accounts of flying humanoids like the Mothman for many, many years. And, like the Thunderbirds, there seem to be specific areas where they're reported more than others. I will say that the Chicago cases do follow the basic pattern of, again, flying humanoid flaps where you have a short period of time and on a high concentration of these flying humanoid creatures being reported or encountered. Sightings of the Chicago Mothman begin to draw local media attention and soon the creature was being written about in publications such as the Chicago Post. The articles were picked up by the Associated Press and ran in newspapers around the United States and soon a media sensation was born. Just as it had in 1948 and 1977, a winged creature flap was drawing national attention. And just as it had in the previous waves, the brighter the spotlight, the more the witnesses that came forward. And this happens with a lot of cases that there are originally very credible stories behind it and then the media descends, monster hunters descend, and all hell breaks loose. And now the reports get stranger and stranger. So I think the original reports are what should be looked at and have a lot of credibility to them but some of the later reports, just like every other crypto out there, have to be looked at with a little more, I think a little more of a critical eye. And the closer you get to the actual eyewitnesses, it becomes clear that everybody's seeing different things, that there's different levels of credibility in the eyewitnesses. And if there was 50 sightings in Chicago, Chicago is an urban area, all you would have to do is involve the law enforcement branch of the city of Chicago and there's CCTV cameras all over. Yeah, I'm familiar with Chicago but I wasn't familiar with each of the sighting locations. And then upon going there, my question was why haven't more people reported the Mothman if he, or it, is indeed appearing in these tremendously crowded locations where when I went there at all times of day and night, I was constantly under foot. I've spoken quite a bit in the Chicago metro area on monsters and legends and I have yet to encounter anyone who not only has seen this, but that has a personal story from a friend. I have spoken to witnesses personally. I've worked very closely with every investigator who has spoken to witnesses personally. And if they think that any of the investigators are making it up, they're mistaken. In the months following the intiial outbreak of reports, the Mothman moniker stuck and reports began expanding outside of the city. Suddenly, people were seeing a similar creature over cities and suburbs all along the Great Lakes particularly in the town of Gary, Indiana, only 37 minutes to the south. The wave of sightings swept across Chicago and continued into 2018. While investigators and researchers continued to argue over the possible cause of the flap, witnesses were still seeing something in the skies overhead. But what was it? The other explanation could possibly be what if something extraordinary did happen in the Illinois Chicagoland area? What if there was a UFO or even a Thunderbird sighting and someone knew about it that didn't want other people to believe it? And so they, upon seeing that this account would be released, flood the information channels with bogus accounts? We've talked to a number of people in Chicago. I think there probably were some credible sightings but I think a lot of it might have been exaggerated. In a big city, you're gonna have an active sky. You're always gonna have things moving overhead. 'Cause of course now we live in the age of drones that come in all kinds of shapes including fixed wing that are bat-like shapes. You also have tall buildings so there's the potential that there coulda been thrill seekers doing base jumping with wing suits. So there's all kinds of possibilities you have when you've got a city versus, you know, a corn field out in the middle of nowhere. You know, people may tend to think of these things as flesh and blood animals and why would something like that be near a big city? If we consider that these flying humanoids Okay! may not fit neatly into the natural world Okay, man. so to speak, that they may be something more spectral or supernatural in nature, then that would create no geographic delineations. These things could appear at the time and place of their choosing. Maybe there's misidentification. Some of the researchers on the case like Tobias Wayland from Singular Fortean think that, you know, perhaps global warming is causing some migrational birds into areas where you normally wouldn't see them. When it comes to the Chicago sightings, I think that there are two disparate but concurrent phenomena. And so the first is misidentifications of large migratory birds. People started seeing these birds, they started going online to try to figure out what they had seen. They find websites like Phantoms & Monsters and UFO Clearinghouse and us and they start reporting them. So even though a lot of those turned out to be Great Blue Herons or something similar, it's actually led to a lot of potentially paranormal sightings. While accounts, encounters with Thunderbirds, flying humanoids, any of these weird flying creatures are considered omens, warnings, harbingers of tragic events, we must consider that the word monster comes from a Latin word that means warning. So in a way, all of our monsters are harbingers. Illinois is a state defined by its legends. Like the changing terrain that one finds when they travel north to south, the Prairie State is awash in stories that capture the imagination. Perhaps no town within the state has embraced those legends more than Alton. Here you will find a town that celebrates tales of giant men, mythical musicians, ghosts, and winged cryptids all mingling together just like the waters of the three rivers on whose banks it sits. Centuries tend to carry away lies but a legend is something else entirely, a tale told to bolster or frighten, to invigorate or encourage. Perhaps lost in the passage of time is the fact that the tellers were every bit as important to the story as the characters or creatures that populated it. But where did it begin? With discovery. Discovery of a truth, discovery of an experience that must be related to others. Discovery of a story that, like the mighty Mississippi itself, can live forever. Discovery of a legend still living right here amongst the vanishing Midwest. The reason a lot of people are interested in cryptozoology in general is because people are interested in animals and they're interested in mysteries. Why should people be interested in, for instance, Thunderbirds? Because Thunderbirds could tell us a lot. They could tell us a lot about climate, about the terrain, about their reactions to people to unknown animals. Why are people afraid of animals that are always above them? And that is a key. These animals terrify because they could come out of nowhere. They could kill you, they can take your children, they could take your pets. They don't have a clue about Thunderbirds and that scares the bejeebas outta people. Regardless of the objective truth behind some of these stories, they have a huge effect on people's lives and they have a huge effect on people's outlook. And I think that it teaches us a lot about humanity and I think that it's sort of our ethical duty as human beings to help each other through our experiences. For me personally, collecting this kind of stuff over the years is something that, historically speaking, I find it to be very important because these are stories that would be lost otherwise if someone wasn't writing them down. And I think that, culturally speaking, this is important to us because this is, some day this will be the folklore of our generation. I think that gathering tales of ghosts and monsters and giant birds and whatever is important to American history, American culture, and it is something that future generations are gonna need to understand what we were doing in the 20th century and the 21st century.
