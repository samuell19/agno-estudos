Wishing you joy and prosperity. My name is Ryo Saeba. Some people call me 'City Hunter'. As a private detective, I single-handedly beat bad guys. Actually, I also have a companion named Makimura. But he's neither as smart as me, nor as good a fighter... - Nor as handsome, nor as tall. - Don't you agree? But we're good friends, together in life and death. - Invincible! - Invincible! However, on one occasion he slipped up whilst working alone. Makimura! Makimura, don't you feel well? If you were shot by twenty guns, would you feel well? - Makimura, you're going to be OK. - Ryo, I've taken my last steps. But you have to promise to take care of my little sister, Kaori. OK, I swear I'll take care of her, until I need to be taken care of. There's one more thing. Don't you ever seduce her. OK, I swear I will definitely not seduce her. Good, then I'm free to go. Makimura! From then on, Kaori became my only family. But, I miscalculated one thing. Girls grow up very fast. So fast, that even you in the audience wouldn't believe it. Don't you agree? Why did I promise Makimura not to seduce her? Makimura, I promised you I wouldn't seduce Kaori. Can I reconsider now? You can't! Since then, Kaori has become my assistant. I never knew what she meant to me, until one day... Damn Ryo, sleeping again! A GIFT TO MY DEAREST RYO FROM KAORI, FOR THE 100TH TIME Hey, Ryo! Hey, you wake up! Hey, get up! Don't sleep! Time's up already! Get up! Wake up! Hey, hey... Ryo, you're always with us. You're not afraid Kaori will get jealous? Kaori? She's only a little sister to me. She's at home now cleaning the toilet for me. - What? Cleaning the toilet? - Correct. - Ryo, I like your family dog. - Her? She's big and fat! Built like a tank! She eats seven meals a day, and wanders the streets looking for hanky-panky. As long as it's male, it's OK. Even sillier, she sticks her tongue out. Raising her hands, twisting her ass. I was going to give her away. I begged for ages, but no one wanted her. Damn you, Ryo! Very comfortable! Hey! Wake up! Don't sleep! Hey! He's Ryo Saeba, I'm his assistant, Kaori. Mr. Imamura arranged for us to come. Hey, Ryo, wake up! We're in someone else's place. Wake up! Hey! Wake up! Hey! What perfume do you use? What foundation? What brand of skin care? - What do you do? - Secretary. What's your name? I've become a dwarf! - Hey, what're you thinking? - What's it to you? Mr. Saeba, I'm Koji Imamura, owner of Imamura Newspapers. She's my only daughter, Kiyoko. She lost her mother at an early age, so her character is rebellious and stubborn. Last year, I met a girlfriend. Our feelings quickly progressed. We intend to marry this year. But Kiyoko disapproves, so she ran away from home. It took a long time to find out that she went to Hong Kong alone. So you want my help to get her back? But you can't use force to bring her back. Don't worry, he doesn't use force on girls. - Ryo, I have something to tell you. - Go ahead. - I'm going to give you a birthday present. - What? A skate-boarding gang? In what park? Lai Chi Kok? Ocean Park? - Do you like sailing? - I like it. A luxury ferry is taking its maiden voyage. Let's board for a few days. Umibouzu, that's really distinguished! I'll contact you later. - What were you saying? - I asked if you like sailing? Can you drive, fat granny?! Kaori, you head off to Lai Chi Kok and look for Kiyoko. I'm going to Ocean Park. - We'll talk when you get back. - Damn you, Ryo! Run me over! Go on, you run me over! You think having a car is a big deal? Run me over! Next time, I'll smash your car with a hammer! - Kiyoko, are you Japanese? - Do I speak Cantonese like a Japanese? Going clubbing tonight? You haven't had enough fun yet? Then let's go. Sorry! Aren't you Kiyoko Imamura? It can't really be that easy to find you? Who are you? I'm Ryo Saeba. Your father asked me to bring you home. Hey, don't go! What's the matter? That bad man wanted to molest me. Quick, help me! Stop him! Hey, why did you molest my girlfriend? You villain! Hitting me?! Chase him! - Don't go! - Stop! Don't go! Sorry! Buying clothes, Miss? - Sir, can you do me a favour? - Me? Me, really? - Yes, you! - OK! Kaori, where are you? I'm hungry, I haven't eaten all day. Where are you? Ryo's birthday! My birthday? How miserable! Nothing to eat on my birthday. Only half a piece. Kaori...? Kaori, where the hell are you? Ryo, happy birthday! Wow! All those boobies! So many girls know today's my birthday?! - Ryo! - When did I seduce you girls? - Think for yourself. - Never mind, I don't care. I'm hungry, I'll eat some cake first. - No, let us tie you up, then feed you. - OK, tie me, tie me... I'm hungry! Hey! Are you short-sighted? My mouth's here! You're short-sighted! You've never met us before. Why did you wish me a happy birthday? You caught all our boyfriends and husbands. We came for revenge! - Right. - Hit him! - Don't! - Don't go! - Catch him! - Don't go! - Listen to me! - I won't! - Want to get away? - Stop! - Beat him! - Over there! - Catch him! - Don't move! Put the weapons down! Happy birthday! - Kaori! - What are you doing? These girls are trying to kill me! You're holding the gun and are saying they want to kill you? What game is this? - Ryo! - What? - Ryo, who's she? She's very ugly! - She... I... She... Damn you, Ryo! I hate you, Ryo! I'm taking an expensive holiday with my cousin. Kaori! This is down to you, damn bitches! If you're a hero, then don't use a gun. Fine, I'll show you how capable I am. - Don't come over! - What do you want? Go away! Cousin, you should've left Ryo Saeba. He has a big nose and small eyes, and there's a lot of body fat on show. What's so good about him? You've dropped your trousers! What the hell?! Who are you guys? Think you can just say "sorry"? Damn foreigners! I'm smiling, so you don't know that I'm scolding you. Your red beard and green eyes are disgusting! You three damn gays, I hope you all get AIDS! Young man, you shouldn't talk like that. Didn't your father teach you any manners? Your trousers have dropped again! Kaori! Wait a minute! Wait a minute. - Wait for you? Of course! - Hey, where have you been? - You walk so slowly. - Time's up, let's go. How embarrassing! - Hey, do you know him? - He's a private detective, Ryo Saeba. - He's Ryo Saeba? - He's troublesome. Kaori... Welcome, welcome. Sir, please present your invitation card. - Chewing gum. - Sir, I want to see your invitation card. - Oh, a card? - Yes. - Here... - You really have a sense of humour. Don't go! What's this card? Mahjong Club membership card? I must find a way in. - Miss, please board. - Thanks. Attention, passengers. This ship is about to set sail. I'm starving! So easy to get on! First, find some food. - You have to take care. Don't be careless. - Excuse me, where's the restaurant? - The restaurant's at... - I know! You, catch him, but don't bother the other passengers. Sir, something to drink? - Sir, something to drink...? - Thanks. What are you doing? - I didn't look! - You peeped at my girlfriend! Hey, don't tread on my bread! Hey... You trod on my bread! Why did you tread on my bread? Give me my bread! - Over there. Grab him! - Catch him! - Did you see him? - No. No? Where'd he go? Look around. - There's a ship ahead. Sound the horn. - Yes. Please. - It's a beautiful room. - Put the luggage away. Help me! Help me! - You fell again? - I lost my balance. Of course! Your burdens are too heavy. This charity cruise ship is the Fujimaru. They say the people on board are very rich. Do you think I'll have a chance of finding a rich and handsome boyfriend? Don't forget your mission. Keep my identity a secret. - Yeah, if you guys crack the case, do I get a reward? - Of course. If our information is right, there'll be a gang of international thieves on board. Why not cancel the trip? Because there's no evidence, and my boss wouldn't help me. I had to come aboard myself to find evidence. - Do you have any weapons? - One or two pieces. - You almost hit me! - You're rather late! Traffic jam. This room's really nice. We can have fun here. You shouldn't have been late. We can't have anything go wrong. Relax, don't be so tense. We're going to have fun here... ...until midnight. The way you eat, how do you expect to find a rich husband? I can't stand the temptation. Oh, bugger! Are they all chewing gum or can't I hear? Saeko, look! It's that silly guy from this morning. The troublesome Ryo Saeba, causes trouble wherever he goes. - Hey, don't flirt! - But I want to. - He's so lewd, aren't you afraid? - Aren't all men lewd? - All he needs is a woman. - Is there a woman better than me? - He's very poor. - Waste of time! Hamburger, hamburger! Don't go, hamburger! - You like? - I like very much. No hurry. Tonight they'll be ours. - You go that way, I'll go this way. - Follow me. - Sorry. - Hurry up! Wait for me! Cousin, as soon as we reach Japan, let's get married and have children. Ryo Saeba will finally be out of my life. Ryo will surely come looking for me. Impossible. We're out at sea. He can't get here, unless he knows how to fly! Kaori? - Cousin, protect me! - No problem. What are you doing here? What are you doing here? Aren't you on holiday with those six girls? I... I can't hear what you're saying! Disappear fast, and don't hinder my holiday with my cousin. Kaori, I'm deaf! No matter what I say, you always pretend to be deaf. You want me back? You must agree to three conditions. First: from now, no acknowledging other women. Second: no dating other women. Third: no staring at other women. Damn it, I'm really deaf! I can't hear what you're saying! Playing deaf? Forget it! What? What? Damn foreigner! If my cousin wasn't here, I'd use my family's unique Dragon's Claw. One grip will kill you! - What? - Let's go. Lucky for you! - Let me tell you a secret. - What? - The doctor said I have piles. - Seriously? - You're still swimming? - Don't tell anyone! I can hear everything! I have eight. Banker has nine. Banker wins. Good, good. An eight lost? That's too much! I said the banker would win. You didn't listen! Bet the banker. Cousin, why do we have two separate rooms? It's such a romantic trip, don't you think there's time for passionate love to blossom? - How about tonight...? - OK, tonight you sleep in my room. - OK. - But I'll be sleeping in yours. I'm embarrassed, but I'll get over it. Bigfoot, you mustn't be sad and ashamed. You need thicker skin, to have no shame. No self-respect, no sense of reason. Don't stop until Kaori's yours. You must be successful! I'm so kinky. My cousin is sure to be mine! Great, you're really kinky! - Let's have some fun. - Have you forgotten our mission? There might be clues at the gambling table. See that guy, he looks good. Must be a rich boy. You wish. He's Kotetsu, the Asian gambling master. He steals girls' hearts as well as money. There's trouble wherever he goes. - I have seven. - Four! Four! Four! Eight, winning again. You always have eight or nine, you're cheating! You bet, you pay. Don't get angry. - Search him! - Yes! Sorry, sir. Sir, don't make trouble here. I was only defending myself. Hey, have some tea. Find an ashtray for me. Cash in, thanks. - Carry on. - It's OK. - Thanks a lot! - Your ace of hearts. Keep it as a souvenir. - Hey, if you don't want him, give him to me. - He has good taste. OK. Everyone, adjust the time. It's now 23:31. There are twenty-nine minutes to midnight. - Vincent, you take Team A, move in four minutes. - Yes, boss. - Mike, you take Team B, move in nine minutes. - Yes. Kim and I will go to the casino and watch the babes. Relax everyone, loosen up a little. This time we must succeed. Did you hear what the boss said? It's no time for accidents! I have thirty names in my hand. They're all billionaires. First, we take control of the ship. Then, we take them all away. What about the others? The sharks should be hungry. Drop them overboard. - Go and look in the next room. - Yes, boss. Let's go! - Who is it? - Room service, Miss. Wait a minute. Come in. Miss, what's the matter? - Can I help? - Mr. Mate, this time it's serious. I have something important to tell the Captain. - The Captain? - Calm down, take it easy. The Captain is resting. You can tell me what happened. No, this is very serious. I'm sorry, Captain's orders. I can't help you. I overheard some terrorists threaten to take the passengers hostage. - Terrorists? How do you know? - I heard them threatening to take over the ship. OK, I'll take you to see the Captain. Follow me. Watch your step. I'm starving to death! A rat! Tonight, I've got a snack! - Mr. Mate, the Captain? - He's in the nightclub. - Why did you bring me here? - Didn't you say there were terrorists on board? I'm one of them. You... We'll take over the ship, and take all the rich people to Thailand. - You're a villain! - Sorry, little girl. Sorry. - Ryo Saeba! Why are you here? - I came for you. Hold this for me. That was my snack! Don't move! Don't move! Anyone moves and I'll shoot him! - Kiyoko, go ahead. - OK! Open fire. No bullets. What a miser! Attention, Third Team. Kill the man and woman wearing white. Wait for me! Come on. Search everywhere. Hey, over here! Hey! Where you move is where I'll hit. You... - Kiyoko, are you OK? - I'm OK. Very handsome. I meant him. He's quite handsome. He's a good fighter, and unafraid of the tall black man. In reality, I could handle two or three of them, no problem. - Now get up and lure them out. - What did you say? I don't get it! - To fish you need bait! - No, I can't! Stupid fool! Why did you waste all the bullets? No worries, I'll fight them with my fists! Two or three of them aren't a problem, right? Get them! Still not running? What do we do now? - That's what you should've said. - What do we do now? Don't worry, I'm here. I'll take care of them. - Are you OK? - Absolutely. Nothing's the matter. It hurts! Just kill me, you two! Kill me, kill me! Your shoes are enormous! Don't come over! Put me down! Ryo! Help me, Ryo! Put her down, if you've got the guts! Don't come over! Don't! Ryo's great! Ryo! - How many terrorists are there? - Don't know. - How many guns? - Don't know that either. Find a place to hide. - Where is it safe? - Your room? - I've just come from there. - That's why no one would suspect it. Let's go. Thanks, Brother Siu Lung. You're welcome. Don't move! Don't move! Hands on your head! We're taking over this ship. You're dreaming. Dear guests, Captain Williams will now open the champagne. May you have a pleasant voyage. Captain Williams, please... - It would be good if Ryo was here. - What's so good? - How about my bow tie? - Not bad. - There really are terrorists! - Calm down. Why did you drop the gun? So, pretty lady, we meet again. You dealt with one? - What are you doing? - Looking for something to eat. Nothing, only cigarettes! You deserved to die. Smoking is bad for your health. - Hey, do you have anything to eat? - Bubble gum. Bubble gum is fine. What's that? A microcomputer. It records information about criminals from around the world. As long as he's got fingerprints, we can find the criminal's data. Understand? Crouch down. With one sweep we'll learn all about the two black devils who touched your butt. Ryo Saeba. Nickname: City Hunter. A private detective. Characteristics: Likes women, handsome, distinguished. Good fighter, honest, smart and reliable, and filial towards parents. - It's you? - Just having fun. They're staying next door. We'll be able to get their fingerprints. Chan Tai-Man. International criminal, previously deported from seventeen countries. Wanted by the USA. Former member of two terrorist organisations. Right? Let's see if there's another profile. How are you, Mr. Chan? Still not running? Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Donald Mac. You can call me MacDonald. We just want to get rich. So, I hope that you don't resist. If you co-operate, we won't kill you. Otherwise, it's immediate execution. I have in my hand a list of names. If your name is read out, please come up. Otherwise, it's immediate execution. I'll now read out the names. Mr. Robinson. - Me? - Don't go! - I'll die if I don't. - Don't go! Hey! Wait for me here. Give up! Give up! - What? - Big Brother! - Bigger Brother! - We're fighting the game, not real people! - What are you two doing? - Playing "Street Fighter II". - Don't you know there are terrorists on board? - You seem like a terrorist! - They're going to kidnap all the passengers, understand? - They're going to what? - Is there a way into the casino? - Yes, take the lift. - I meant without being seen. - Yes, take the lift and don't tell anyone. Enough nonsense! Try to alert the police, then come and find me. - Don't wander around, understand? - OK, bye. - Well? - I'll take you to the air conditioner. Air conditioner? Later, there's going be an amusing game of chance. Ladies and gentlemen, please will you take out all your cash and jewellery. Put them into the man in red's bag. Hurry up! Hurry up! You, hurry up! Then please line up, one after another. As you're so fond of gambling, I challenge everyone to gamble. - We'll see who's the winner. - Come on! There's someone else on board. It could be the City Hunter, Ryo Saeba. - Take a few men to catch him, but don't kill him. - Yes. - There's no one around. Quick, send a cable. - OK, have you seen this? So awesome! This is the new telegraph. Take a look, Little Brother! - This is the telegraph? - I bought it off the TV for $500. Bought it for $500? Impossible! What are you doing? Do you know what you're doing? - You're pressing 1-2-3-4. - Right. - What's 1-2-3-4 used for? - Spelling. - Spelling what? Look upwards. - What? - There's a word. Read it. - Good. Stand back. You're the first. Please sit. - Do you like baccarat? - I like it. I like it, too. OK, deal cards. - I have seven. - Good, seven. Very good. I have nine. - Six - I have six, too. - Then it's a draw. - Sorry, banker's bonus. - Next. - I won't bet, I won't bet! If I bet, I'll die. Show some manners. Take her to your room. - Get up! - Don't! Don't! Don't! - Wait! - What are you doing? Nothing, nothing. I just wanted to ask if you needed a tonic? Let me play first. Trust me. Seven. Let's play another game. That way. Brother, you're pretty good. You've won twelve games in a row. Mr. Donald, do you want to know where Ryo Saeba is? - Ryo Saeba? You know? - Of course I do. Good. Tell me, and I won't kill you. I don't know. Go over there and distract them. Hey, nothing to do with me! - Ryo, what about me? - Stand there, don't move. - Ryo! - You fight well. Kaori was taken to that foreigner's room. Quick, save her! - Hey, I left someone waiting up there. - I'll take care of them for you. Why the need to rush? No hurry. Let's get in the mood first. You're great, I like you! Oh, so that's how you like it? - Now it's my turn. - OK, as you wish. Not there, but here. - Great! - My turn again. - Feeling romantic yet? - Very romantic! Then here I come! Kaori! - What are you doing here? - I'm here to save you! I don't need saving. We're having a good time here. - Who's this guy? - I'm Ryo Saeba! Ryo Saeba?! - Hey, they say you're a good fighter. - He too is a good fighter. You're not coming to beat him? You hit my girlfriend?! He said I was his girlfriend? Ryo, what did you just say? Say it again. Fat granny! Not that! Fat granny! You're right. I am a good fighter. Don't move! - Don't move. - I'm not moving. - Give me the gun. - Don't give it to him. - What? - Hit me, if you have the guts. - Get her! - Yes! Nice to meet you, Mr. Saeba. Fat granny! If you've got the skill, put down the gun and fight me... Major MacDonald. You know who I am? United States Commando, Major MacDonald. You're not a terrorist, you're a thief. - Right, therefore I sentence you to death. - I want to appeal. No right of appeal. You'll be executed before sundown tomorrow. Don't! - Where's Ryo? - What's it to you? - Forget the grudge. Didn't Ryo save you? - Maybe he was caught? Now we must believe in ourselves, and fight back to save Ryo. - Fight back with what? With our fingers? - I have guns in my room. - Ryo and I were almost killed by him. - We have no weapons. Better attack him covertly. I'll seduce him. - Good idea! - Let us try first. - Cousin, you help take him down. - No problem. I'm an investment banker, don't kill me. You can do whatever you want. I like big men. - Hello! Yes, I'm very busy. Talk later. - You! I'm an investment banker. I also like big men. - Stay with me tonight, then. - You can't be serious?! You charge the door, Kaori and I will enter. - Will it hurt? - It's not that painful. Go! Come on! Get down! Don't move! Hit him! Let me! The unique Dragon's Claw! Too cruel! Find some comfortable clothes, then gather back here. Good! - The men's room should be that way. - Right, that way! Pick your weapon of choice. - Here, this is for you. - I don't know how to use a gun. I'll choose this one. It's awfully heavy! Out of the way. Good as gold. - Why are you wearing pyjamas? - She said, find some comfortable clothes. Where is the men's room? - One group saves Ryo, the other saves the hostages. - I want to save Ryo. - Cousin, we'll save the hostages. - We'll save Ryo. Mr. Saeba, today's your last chance to see the sun. - Everyone gets a last wish before execution. - Tell me. I want a bowl of wonton noodles. I'm starving to death! He must be crazy, wanting to eat wonton noodles before death. - Sorry, no chance. - Damn foreigner, denying me such a simple wish. All right, prepare to execute. Hold on. - What're you doing here? - My little princess, so glad to see you. I beg you to release Ryo. Your goal is to get money. My father is Japanese newspaper magnate Koji Imamura. I'll ask him to give you a lot of money. You really think I would believe you? You can place a call to my father's office. The number is 025 2429. Write the number down, call and check. - Saeba's really that important to you? - He's the best man I've ever met. OK, I'll send word of this good man's death to your father in Japan. You're despicable! Nobody move! - Drop your weapons! - Go now! I'm losing my balance again! - Catch them! - Yes! - Catch it! - I don't have hands! - Are you all right? - Go now! - Give me the gun. - Take it! Take it! Shoot him! - Not too heavy, right? - You're crushing me to death! Move it! Give me the gun. Go up and hide. - What? - Come on! - How do I get up? - Hurry up! Up! So stupid, we forgot to untie the rope! Sorry, I can't help you. - What is it? - Go! Thunder Team? You two that way, you three that way. The rest follow me. Is anyone there? I told them not to run around. Oh! You guys are wearing makeup? Quick, help me untie the rope. Quick, help me untie the rope! Who's next? No electricity. Let's see what you can do! - Great! - It hurts. - Hey, what did you do? - Hey, what just happened? - I don't know what happened. - I know, he's dead! - He's not dead, you see... - Would be better if he was dead. - Go now to the upper deck, Thunder Group is here. - Yes, yes... - Right, we'll go up there. - Hey, wait! - What? - Kaori? - Kaori went to the casino to rescue passengers. - So I'll go to the casino... - Go to the casino. - How come...? Crazy... Hurry up! - There they are! Quickly! - Hurry up! Look out! Split up! Get in! I'll try my luck. Bugger! Kotetsu ! Kotetsu! Kotetsu! - How are you? - I'm all right, thanks to your ace of hearts. The Taiwanese Thunder Team is on board. Quick, get to the hostages on deck. - And you? - I'm going to the casino to help Ryo and Kaori. Can you manage? I can. But next time, I'll take you on a date. - Look around. - OK. - Kaori! Kaori! - Ryo! Look out! - Run out of bullets again? - Don't worry. Ryo, behind you. Perfect match. Ryo! I've been waiting for you. - Don't move! - Don't move! - You're still holding her? - Hey, she's my weapon. She's really your girlfriend. MacDonald, Thunder Team has control of the ship. You can't get away! With you as hostages, I can go by lifeboat. Let's make a deal. If you let me go, I'll let this tall girl go. Don't let him escape. He beat my cousin until he no longer looked human. Where? He beat me almost to the point of death. You really don't look human! Rear angle, forty-five degrees. - Thank you very much. - Lost playing, again. Goodbye, Ryo Saeba. You're dead... Don't kill me, I have seven children. Don't kill me! You jerk, a hundred years in prison is too short. Two hundred years, then? - Look at you. Twist your ears! - Twisting my ears! - Say ten times "I won't dare to do it again". - I won't dare to do it again. Won't dare... - That's all? - You wish! Ryo, catch! I knew I shouldn't have jumped! - Ryo, catch! - Throw it over here! Block up, block middle, block down, block down... Block up, block right, block left, block right... Random block... Can't hit me! Can't hit me! I dodge. Can't hit me! Can't hit me... Come on... - Damn kid! - Still can't hit me! What can you do? Come on. Goodbye, Ryo Saeba! Ryo! - Saeko, are you all right? - I'm OK, just some bruising. - Can I hold you? - OK. Ryo! Kaori! - Are you all right? - I'm hurt! - Where does it hurt? - My whole body hurts! Let me hold you. Any better? That's good, everyone is fine. No, what about Kiyoko? Where's Kiyoko? - Hey, take care of Saeko for me. - Ryo, you're killing me! - Kiyoko. - Ryo. - Kiyoko, don't go, OK? - I'm not going, I'll never go. - I promise anything you need. - Really? Fetch me a bowl of wonton noodles! I'm so hungry! Ryo! Hey, are you all right? - Mr. Saeba, I'm very grateful to you. - You're welcome. Please sit. Mr. Saeba, I wish to talk to you alone, about a private matter. Then I'll leave. Then I'll leave, too. I'll see you out. Don't put any calls through. Since returning from Hong Kong, Kiyoko's nature has changed. - It's to your credit, Mr. Saeba. - That's very kind. I hope you'll pursue my daughter. I believe only you can tame her. She's my only daughter, the apple of my eye. I've spoilt her all her life. After I retire, I'll leave all my assets to my son-in-law. Kiyoko is very pretty, I'm sure you won't refuse. - Why? - First, it's not in my nature. Second, I like my freedom. That's why I'll never get married. The young lady outside left in a hurry. Just let her go. Mr. Imamura, thank you very much. Be sure to pay now, otherwise I charge interest! Where did the girl go? - She went that way. - That way? Miss, what's your name? - Miss Choi. - Miss Choi? Kaori, Kaori, where are you going? This flower's for you. Hey, don't be like this. - Kaori, listen to me. - I won't! You'll become someone's son-in-law now. Am I supposed to follow you and be your housemaid? You know I don't like eating raw fish. Congee with fried dough suits me more. Don't be angry, this flower's for you. Ryo! - Ryo. - Saeko. - Are you free? - I'm free. - Coming to Disneyland with me? - OK. Wow! What beautiful flowers. - Here you go. - Thanks a lot. Ryo! It's my lucky day! If I'm dreaming again, don't ever wake me up! Take your turn...
