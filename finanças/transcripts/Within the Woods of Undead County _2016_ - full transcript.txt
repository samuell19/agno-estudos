And now we have some exciting news regarding the medical fiel The pharmaceutical company MediMiracle has just announced their new line of over the counter prescription medication that's scheduled to hit the public market tomorrow. Joining us tonight is MediMiracles CEO and head of project development, Douglas Young. Mr. Young thanks so much for being with us tonight. You're welcome, it's great to be here. So, your company is coming out with this new line of medicine that some are calling the wonder drug. I'm sure the public is curious to know what it is and how exactly it works. Maybe you could enlighten us. Sure, well like you said, we've created a whole new line of easy to to afford, over the counter medication that has the ability to deter everything from the common cold, to the recent spread of EHD. And how was your company able to do this? Well, using extracted DNA from several, common viruses we were able to create a new virus. Genetically mutated to attack those with properties similar to its own. It wasn't long before we were able to create our own medication, which is called Zaltrox. Once released, the drug goes straight for the virus, latches onto it, and destroys it. How does this connect with the recent outbreak of EHD in the wildlife populations. Well, for those who don't know, EHD stands for Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease. It's a viral infection that was first discovered in deer. Originally, it was thought that Humans were immune to it. However, with the recent cases springing up involving new strands of EHD, which have been found in humans, the FDA was happy to hear that we had a preemptive solution to the problem. And speaking of the FDA we've actually held an interview with one of your competitors, The Willin Brothers. And this this is what they had to say. Let's take a look. Douglas Young and the MediMiracle company are taking things too far. It's one thing for the FDA to push out a Medication to prevent a public scare, but it's another to use it to treat a virus that's so newly discovered, that they don't even know what it's going to do. This isn't about corporate competition anymore, it's about the safety and the well-being of the public. Douglas Young and the MediMiracle company need to do their final testing before releasing it. So, that being said, and taking The Willin Brothers concerns into consideration, do you believe that the release of Zaltrox can be dangerous to the public? No. No, I do not. You scared the hell out of me. Jocelyn, something is happening. What's going on? I don't know, there are all these riots going on in the street. Everyone is going crazy. I was on my way to work and these people started attacking each other. They started chasing me and I came back here. I... Okay, just calm down. Take a seat, I'm going to call the police. The lines are busy. It's busy? It can't be busy. What do you mean they're busy? The TVs are out too. Oh my god. What's happening? It's going to be alright. Just calm down. Jocelyn, I can't calm down. I was almost attacked in the street! Well, what do you want to do? I think we should just stay here and wait for someone to... (Man on TV) Officials are now awaiting troops from the National Guard to be deployed. It seems that Northeastern region of Pennsylvania is the hardest hit by this ongoing epidemic of mass murder. We are told, by local authorities, to insist that everyone please remain calm, and stay tuned for further update. Once again, it has been established that the bodies of the recently dead are returning to life and committing acts of cannibalism. This is not a hoax, nor a test, in any way. We'll go out the back and down to the street. I can't, I'm afraid. Carol, we have to go! They're out there too! No! Jocelyn! Get Up. Are you one of them? One of what? Are you one of them? Were you bitten? No! Don't lie to me. I'm not lying to you. I wasn't bitten. I'll kill you right where you stand. You listen to me, asshole. I'm having one hell of a morning, and you're in no position to start threatening me. Put that gun down! What the hell is going on!? We probably only know as much as you do right now, but We're not going to hurt you. So, just, put the gun down. Okay, look, I'm Ashm. This is Kelly. And, you already met Matt. Gonna put the gun down, or what? What's your name? Jocelyn. Well, we gotta get moving. Just, give her a minute for god sakes. We don't have a minute. See what's going on here? These alleyways are gonna be swarming soon. We need to get as far away as we can. We can't stay here. Where are we supposed to go? We go to the woods. The woods? Think about it. It's big enough, it's isolated, and we can get to it on foot. But we gotta get moving. Now. Shit! Radio: Please follow the directions given to us. We are told to tell citizens to try to make it to a rescue station. If you cannot make it to a rescue station If you cannot make it to a rescue station, we will find you. Officials are waiting on more of the National Guards troops to be deployed. Jocelyn, turn off that shit, please. I can't stand that guy anymore. No, we need to keep it on in case there's an update of what we should do. No, Matt's right. It's been on for hours. Save the battery for now. We've been walking this path for days now. Don't you think it's time we get off the mountain? Yea, I'm sick of this camping shit. Well Matt, let's keep in mind that it was you that brought us up here. You're damn right I did. It's happening in populated areas, this is where I wanna be. Well yeah, think about it. I mean, who the hell would be wandering around up here? Out for a Sunday stroll in the woods? Bullshit. Alright guys, we really need to get off the mountain. I need food, water, any kind of supplies. Yea, why don't you get some Jack Daniels and tampons too while you're at it? Well Matt, why don't you pull out the map and see what town is nearby? Fine, but I know where we are. You and that fucking map! How old is it anyway? I don't know, few years? Five at the most. Trails don't change that much. We've been walking for too long. I'd complain about needing a shower but who even knows even if the water is on anymore. Who the hell even knows if anyone is still alive. We basically skipped out on civilization the day everything went down. Be nice if we had a different radio station to listen to, then we could at know what's going on. I'm sorry I brought us the fuck up here. My bad that we had to leave town early before we got chewed and chomped on like dog food. But do you know what? We're up here and we're surviving better than anyone else right now. Alright!? I guess we should thank you for leading us to safety. Thank you Matt for leading us to the middle of fucking nowhere. You're welcome, bitch. Alright, what does the map say? Looks like we're right here. Around this small town. Looks like Hometown. I think we should take the next chance and find a path down off the mountain. Sounds find to me. Fine. Here. Take the map, put it in your bag. We're gonna stay on this trail for a few more miles, just to be safe. Okay, yeah, let's just stay in the woods some more. Let's not head down where there's food, survivors, supplies, anything we could use. You know what, bitch... Why don't you just fucking lead us somewhere. Walk ahead of us. When you get your face chewed off by a fucking zombie. You'll know you should have listened to me. Shut the fuck up, Matt. Hey, fuck you Kelly! Both of you, shut the fuck up! This isn't getting us anywhere! We're all just a bit stressed right now. A bit? A bit's an understatement. Hell, a shitload is an understatement. We all just need to calm down, put our heads together, and think for a minute. Alright, the next path that comes up I'll take the lead. Fine, whatever the hell you wanna do. Fine with me. And you... had better start watching your mouth Kelly. The next time that we have to save your ass from those fucking things, I may forget you're not one of them, and take your god damn head off. Fucking prick. It's this way. Do you even know where we're going? I know where we're going. Let me just see the map real quick. Do you even know how to read this thing? Do you know how to read a map? Guys. Yeah, I don't think you're reading this thing correctly. I know how to read a map. Looks like we could have marched half way out of the state by now. I said I know how to read a map. Guys. You know, I don't think you have any idea where we're going. You know what!? GUYS! Look... And what is that? It's a tree stand. A tree stand? They use it for hunting. Look at all that blood. What the hell happened? What are you doing? There might be something up there. What's up there? Nothing. Just this. Oh look, a bat. Now we're all saved. We should probably get out of here now. Whatever happened here didn't happen that long ago. Think we should take this path. Looks like it leads down the mountain. Go on. Knock yourself out. Go ahead, you wanted to lead. It's your chance to be a hero. Fine. Maybe someone should go with him. The hell for, he wanted to lead. You wanna follow him? Go right ahead. Fuck that, I ain't going anywhere. Where the fuck are you going? I'm going after him. Jocelyn, maybe you shouldn't. Fine... When you both turn into one of those things I have no problem coming down there and put you both out of your misery. Permanently! Shit, no one fucking listens to me. What, can't you keep your two bitches in line? What the hell's taking them so long. You wanted to play leader, why don't you go get them. I don't care about them that much. Jocelyn! Ashm! Jocelyn, go! Run! Shit! Oh, shit! Go, go, go, go! Ashm, DUCK! Come on... Come on! Oh shit... Come on, get up! Oh god, she's bitten. I tried to get it off but I couldn't get it in time! Look at her side! Think you can walk? Does it look like I can walk!? We gotta move. Here, I'll take her. Stop! Guys, stop. I can't go any further. Looks like we're safe for now. Just, let me see the wound. It, it hurts... I know, just let me take a look at it. Oooh, god damn! How bad? Well, it's not good. Not good? It's fucking disgusting! It hurts. I'm going to do my best to clean it out. Get the map out too. The map's gone. What do you mean it's gone!? It's gone! It was in my bag. It must've fallen out when we got jumped. Well now what the hell are we gonna do!? Don't start arguing again! It's not gonna help anything. We should probably set up camp soon anyway. Here, keep pressure on that. Jocelyn's right. We need to go get some fire wood. Come with me. Yeah. Alright. Put you down here. Alright, get a camp fire going. That'll warm you up. Matt... We'll get you patched up. Matt. We'll get off this mountain. Alright, okay... Matt! Come sit with me. I know I'm gonna die. Don't say that. I've been thinking like that since we came up here. Something's wrong. I don't feel right. It figures I wouldn't escape this whole shit scenario we're in. I'm terrified, but at the same time, I don't give a shit. I'm ready to go. Just promise me something. What? Don't let me become one of those...things. I can't become a monster. Kelly? Kelly!? Pretty close call back there. She's not gonna make it. We don't know that. She's lost too much blood. I know. I saw some guy get jumped back at the university. Guy got back up immediately. Turned into one of those...things. We're putting ourselves at risk by being around her. So what do you want to do? You just want to leave them up here? That's what Matt would do if it were me. I'm not Matt. I don't know what else to do. Well, we're not leaving them behind. Fine, what happens if she turns. Just cross that bridge when we come to it. I remember the first time we met. Couldn't keep my eyes off of you. I was really never that good with women. But you gave me a chance. Even in the worst of times. My mood swings, your irritable attitude. You stuck by me. And I never knew why. And I didn't ask. I'm sorry I couldn't protect you. Jesus... What did you do? She turned into one of those things. I did what I had to do. FUCK! I'm done, I'm out of here. Should never have brought you up here. Matt! Matt! Matt! Matt, stop! Matt, would you stop? Matt. Matt, hold up... I'm sick of the leader bullshit. So what, you're just gonna leave us up here... That's the plan. Where the hell are you gonna go? We're in the middle of the fucking woods! I don't know, alright!? I don't know. What happened to Kelly, it wasn't your fault. You did everything you could to protect her. Hell, you lead us up here. Wasn't for you, we'd probably be lying dead somewhere. Or worse. I can't handle this shit anymore. You can't handle it!? Matt, you're not the only one up here! Jocelyn, that girl back there, she trusted us. She followed us up here. And you're just gonna abandon her. I don't know what the hell you're doing, but we can't survive without you. And I'm damn sure you can't survive without us. Radio: It's escalating and no one, I repeat, no one is safe at this time. Please follow the directions given to us. We were told to tell citizens to stay where they are and wait for rescue. As of right now, the cause for this recent outbreak within the Northeasters regions of the United States remains a mystery. However, there have been reports that the theory behind this horrific event is the fault of the pharmaceutical enterprise Medimiracle. Many scientists and industry professionals are claiming that the sudden release of their new medication Zaltrox has bonded with the recent EHD virus, instead of destroying it, creating this bizarre, hybrid, mega virus. While this is yet to be proven, it is said that many of those infected are those who previously had the EHD virus and had taken the Zaltrox drug. We'll update our listeners on this story when we have more information. With every moment that passes, we are receiving new information. It's unbelievable. Ever time we stop I start to wonder about the people I know, or... used to know. Yea, I've been... I've been thinking about that since we've been out here. Who'd you leave behind? No one really. I mean... My parents live in upstate New York and... they told me they were going to some fallout shelter. I lost communication with them when everything went down and... I don't know where they are. Here I am and... Hope they're still okay. I'm sure they are. What about you Matt? Who'd you leave behind? I had a girlfriend. Not anymore. What about you? I don't wanna talk about it? Think we're gonna judge you? Well... My mom died years ago and... My dad's new girlfriend kicked me out of the house a couple months after. So I moved in with my sister after that. When all of this happened... I left her. What happened? A few of those things broke into our house. We tried to run out the back door, but they got to us first. So we ran towards the fire escape. But Carol wouldn't follow me. She was too scared. By the time I was outside of it, I turned around. And they were already attacking her. So I ran. She died quickly. You were scared. It's... It's what anybody would have done. No, no one would have. I can still hear her screaming. I... I'm gonna have to live with that for the rest of my life. Well... It's gonna be okay. Let's get some rest. Be up by sunrise. You left me... Matt! What are you doing? I think that bastard took off without us. Matt! You don't think he's actually leave us, do you? Matt! Matt! Shit, what do we do? Just keep moving. See ya... What are we even doing? What are you talking about? We're in the middle of the woods. There isn't anything, or anyone, up here. That's kind of the whole point. No, we need to come up with a better plan if we're going to stay alive much longer. We will, just, gotta take it step by step. Wow... You think he's in there? We should check it out. Maybe we shouldn't. Come on. Hey, there's water down here. Drop the bat! Drop it, now! What are you doing on my property? Please, I'm not one of those things! I know you're not. If you were, you'd already have a bullet in your head. Please, we just need help. Help? We all need help here in this hell. Don't move there, pretty boy. Whoa, okay, we're not looking for trouble. Just put the gun down. Not looking for trouble. You found trouble the moment you came on my property! Okay, we're just looking for supplies man! Supplies? I ain't got no supplies for you, or no one else! Okay, fine! Just put the gun down and we'll go. You're gonna go alright. You can leave, go on your merry old way. But your little friend here... she stays with me. What? Oh god! Haven't had me a woman in a while. Not since my wife became one of those things. Had to put her down real quick, Not you, you're special. I need a nice fine piece of ass. I already told you man, we're not looking for trouble. Just, drop the gun, we'll walk away. Oh, I know you're gonna walk away. But I told you, your friend here stays with me. Listen, I don't understand why you're doing this, but we just came here for some help. If we're not going to get it, we'll leave. But either way, she's coming with me. I'm gonna fucking blow your brains out! Then, she's gonna blow me. Understand, pretty boy!? Just turn around and walk away in that other direction then. Me and your friend here can get on with our business. That's not happening. What do you mean that's not happening? That's the problem with you kids today! You're stupid! I have the gun. I make the rules. I say what happening, and I say what's not happening! I'm warning you. You little punk. You're warning me? Ever since the worlds gone to shit, there's nobody to help anybody. There's no one to help you. There's no one to stop me. I'm thinking, I can do whatever I want! And there's nothing you, or anyone else can do about it. So basically, fuck you! FUCK! Bastard! God dammit. We gotta get going, now! No! We can't just leave him here! He's dead. They're all dead! You're all gonna die! You're never gonna get out of here alive! You know what... FUCK YOU! You're gonna die just like your pretty boy friend over... You know what? Fuck you. Fuck this. I should've left you in the city. Matt! No! I never should've brought you guys up here. I'm better off without you. You're slowing me down! We're all gonna die! We're all going to hell! This is God's work! We're all going to hell! Well, looky what we have here boys. That sucks man. She's pretty hot too. Looks like she almost got away. The keyword there is "almost." It would be so simple. Yeah, come on man. Do it. Come on man! Shoot her. Alright, that's enough of that. You know we don't waste any ammo. Besides... Look at the bite on her shoulder. She'll be one of them soon anyway. Get the crowbar! Let's get out of here! You're not gonna need this anymore, sweetheart. Move! Let's go! Radio: Words cannot describe the scene in downtown Philadelphia. People are running for their lives as swarms of ghouls attack untold amounts of people. S.W.A.T. teams and state police have been placed to protect the city at all costs. Fires are burning out of control. And emergency rooms in hospitals are reporting a lack of resources and rooms for the injured and deceased. I wish I could begin to tell our listeners that things will begin to look up. There is no help. There is no hope.
