Oh, my God! I don't I've ever had anyone stuck that long in jail. I'm sorry, Bubba. Crazy. 10. She just got doubles. - Okay. - 175. - Mr. Money Bags over here. - I land on it every time. - How much? - I landed on it twice. Don't you remember when you were little when we used to play, you'd never want your ones? You'd be like, "just keep the change." Like you were some big spender. That's why he always used to play banker. - Yeah, I know. - We need to gang up on Sean. Brody, Brody come here. Brody, come. Brody, come here. Oh, no. Don't buy it, no, I wanna buy it! No. Which one's it go with? You know what? Fine, fine. I'm gonna, if you ever wanna buy this one... Alright, what are you thinking? Yay! Eight. Walk up to a butterfly with a stick. I know I said something interesting happened, but I never really knew that... Hey, Chatty Cathy. - Oh yeah. - It's your turn. Okay. Can't tell Mom, this is just between me and you. You're getting the good treats. Good girl. Hmm. Morning. Oh, hey. You were looking so cozy, I just let you sleep. Oh, thank you. You're welcome. I had a really weird dream, though. Yeah? Yeah. We were in the middle of the woods and you were walking ahead of me and I couldn't see your face, and I kept trying to catch up to you, and I couldn't. And I was calling out your name, and you wouldn't turn around. Then I had this overwhelming sense of letting go. I'm sorry. Yeah, you should be, asshole. Well, I promise I'll be nicer to you in your dreams. Oh, thank you. You're welcome. What? There was something else. You stopped at one point and I was finally able to catch up to you, and when I did, I was really afraid. And I called your name one more time and then you turned around and you turned around and... I turned around and what? I woke up. That's when I woke up. I'm making breakfast. - Box came. - Yeah, want anything? No, I'm good. But you know what? You guys eat, let me know, I'll come up and sit with you. Donovans are still getting a box. That's good. Come on, time to get up. Hey, come on, sleepy ahead. It's after 10, daylight's a-wasting. Sean, time to get up, breakfast. - What, what? - It's time to get up. I been up for a while. Yeah, sure you have. I got up at four. - Okay. - I went back to... Sure you did. Okay, come on, breakfast. Any bagels? There's just two, so you can each have one. I don't need a whole one. No, I'm good, and your father doesn't want one, so. Thanks, mom. Cut this now. Any cereal? Oh, no, sorry, bub. Okay. Not like we have any milk anyway. I don't care. Here, put that under there. Be careful. Stephen! Stephen! He cut himself. How bad is it? Get me a rag. You're bleeding, oh, my God. No. Let me see, let me see it, let me see it. You're okay. Front. That's a little deep. How many times have I told you to be careful? Especially when using a knife. - I'm fine, Mom. - But what if it wasn't? What if it was worse? There are no hospitals to go to. There is nobody to call. We're on our own. Do you know what that means? - Mom. - Hey, it's okay. Yes, Mom. They get it. I'm sorry. You don't need to be sorry, you just need to be careful. And keep it elevated. I'll check on it in a minute. - He's gonna be fine. - How many times have we told them they have to be careful? Oh, I don't know, a million. They have to understand, Stephen. They do, they understand. We never should've come here. You'd rather be back in Boston? - In that tiny apartment? - It wasn't that tiny. We would've been tripping all over ourselves. Thank God we've got the summer house. At least there are people there. It's safer with less people. Is it? Really? What if something happened? What if something really happened, Stephen? We would be on our own! We are on our own. We would've been on our own there too. Mass General was still operating before we left. Yeah, but for how long? Everything was being shut down, quarantined. It's safer here. The less people, the safer. - Okay, how's it feel? - It feels better. Doesn't hurt that bad. We got the bleeding to stop, so. Yeah. Just tape that right there. - I love you. - I love you too. Brody. What you looking at, girl? What do you see out there? What are you all worried about, huh? Who's a good girl? Kisses, thank you. Okay. You, you're a mental case. Yes, maybe I am. Ingratiating bastard. Do you always play kiss-ass with the loonies? No. I like you, Kane, you're regular. Take the medal. - I'll take this book. - What book? "I Remember Mamma" by Oedipus Rex. May I go? You're gone, you're gone. So far, so good. So far, very good. This okay? As long as I can turn my pages. Ah, I don't wanna disturb you. Oh no, it's fine. Oh, come on, I'm sorry. I like when you're close. You're such a liar. Mm. What you reading? Jack Reacher. Mm, it's any good? I've read it before. Do you want to talk? No, I'm tired. You go ahead and read. We can talk. I am so sorry about this morning. Don't be. That was scary. Thank God it wasn't something more serious. I really worry about those two boys. I know, I do too. No, not just this morning, I mean... Stephen, they're growing up in isolation. It's not like they were... My God, don't you remember the fights we used to get into trying to get 'em off their computers? Used to yell so much. But they're not outdoor creatures. Sean used to love football. Maybe he will again someday. Don't say that. - Say what? - Someday. We've been waiting for that day for so long, that word has no meaning for me anymore. Hey, we're gonna get through this. Can't go on forever. Donovans are still getting a box. Yeah. And people do recover from it. Before they shut the internet down, how many stories did we read about people that were just raving mad one second and then totally fine the next, like nothing had happened? But how do you know it's real? Don't you ever think about that? I could have been sick this whole time. You could have been sick this whole time. What if it's just a fever dream? How would you know? You wouldn't. What if you're just strapped to a bed somewhere in some induced coma so you don't hurt yourself or rip your face off. And this whole time, you could think you're just lying next to me. How would you know? Because this feels real to me. Doesn't this feel real to you? Look, I know when the days all bleed one into the other, you can feel adrift, but we're here together. Hey. Come here, gimme your hand. Come here. You feel that? Do you feel my heart? Yeah. That's real. That's real. I love you. I love you too. To get to the What are you doing? Let's go! Hi. Go, team, let's go, team, let's go, team! Come on, bub, it's time to get up. Rise and shine, sleepyhead. Wow. I know, I didn't think the seeds from last year were gonna sprout. It's crazy. You wanna help? Not if we want 'em to live. Aw, come on, it's easy. I killed a cactus once. I can't be trusted. Well, at least you can keep me company, right? I can do that. They're early. Go get the boys, I'll get her. Brody, Brody, Brody. Brody, come. Brody, come on. Brody, come on! Hello? Hello, hello, yeah, we're here. Wyatt, Wyatt, it's the call. Whitton family, M-A-6-3-9-6-4. Sean? Sean, it's the call. Wyatt Whitton, identification W-W-3-9-4-7-2. This Anna Whitton, identification A-W-3-9-4-7-1. Sean Witten, S-W-3-9-4-7-3. I didn't get the beep. I didn't get a beep. Identification, you didn't say... Sean Whitton, identification S-W-3-9-4-7-3. We've been asking for shoes for both boys, size nine and 10. - Didn't stay on the line. - It's okay, Dad. Yeah, it's okay. We'll get by. It's been five weeks. We ask for movies, they send movies. Just needs shoes. It's okay, we'll get 'em. It's not like we're going anywhere. Such bullshit. Okay, so we are still on the battle of Gettysburg. Wyatt, can you read the end of the Gettysburg Address there? "We here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain, that this nation under God shall have a new birth of freedom, and that government of the people, by the people, for the people shall not perish from this Earth." Which makes you a murderer, don't it? Palmer now. This is pure nonsense. It doesn't prove a thing. I thought you'd feel that way, Garry. You were the only one that could have got to that blood. We'll do you last. That was not funny. It's a little funny. Blast him! There's so much emptiness. Kill him now. I don't like... Kill him. - Shh, the kids. - I know. - Oh, my God. Is that bacon? - Yes. - Do you want some? - Yes. I'd eat that raw. It was a really good box. Yeah? What else is in there? Do you wanna know or do you want me to surprise you? You know, I actually have to think about that. I'll tell you one thing. One of your favorite things is in there. Okay, that's not fair. I like driving you crazy. Drove me crazy last night. You know, you might as well tell me. You are anyway, you're terrible at keeping secrets. I am not. - Yes I am. - Okay. - Tell me this. - Mm-hmm. Is there sushi in that box? No, there is not sushi in the box. 'Cause that would be fucking awesome. Sushi in a box? Ben to box. Okay, you're gonna be like, what? But you know what I would kill for right now? A fucking Whopper. - What? - No, no, no, no, no, no. An original chicken sandwich from Burger King. Yeah. - That's disgusting. - Oh, no. It's like this laboratory-created perfect disc of like crunchy, greasy yumminess that you just have to eat right there in your car in the parking lot. Drive-throughs. Hey, why don't you go get the kids up? Yeah. She's getting so old. She's a good girl. She's gonna die in this house before this ends. Just like Hooper. And we're already here to bury her. There's no work to miss, no school to skip, no life to go back to. It'll just be something to mark the time. Some stray detail while we wait. Hey. That's my good girl. Yeah, that's my good girl. What's the matter? Wyatt? Wyatt? - Wyatt? - Yeah? How long have you been in there? About a couple minutes. Did you set your timer? 'Course I did. - Five minutes. - I know. No, five minutes, not a minute longer. Four and a half to be safe. - Okay? - Yeah. Fine. Okay, wait, what is this guy? Get the milk. I've never heard you guys do this one before. It's not like we can access it anymore, we're trying. Hey Wyatt, do you remember the? Has anyone seen the dog? - What is he gonna do? - Stop it. No. You guys are being too silly things that they do. Has anybody seen the dog?! - Sorry, I can't find Brody. - She's not on the deck? - I don't see her. - Is the gate closed? Yeah, gates' closed. And she's not out there? Brody! Brody! Come on, girl. Brody, come! Brody! Brody! Brody! Brody! - Ah ha. - Wow! How did you beat that? With that crappy roll. Dad, Northwest territory attacks Alberta. Dad. It's your turn. I'm sorry. We don't have to play if you don't want to. No, no, no. It's fine. She'll come back. You're never gonna love me again? I don't even wanna look at you. Why? I don't like my bread! - I'm just spinning. - Oh yeah! She's gone. She could come back. She's had us worried before. Not like this. This is different. It's okay. Why would she run off? Because she could. Holy shit. And turned the bed around so the next time when the alarm went off, it flew into the wall. He was so fucking mad. He was so fucking mad. He was like, "I'll kill everybody in this room!" Hey, what are you guys watching? Oh, oh, oh no, busted. Definitely, definitely can't go that way. Oh my. What are you guys doing? - It's called laughing. - They're drunk. Wait, how? Well, sometimes the gods, they favour the brave, and they send down from the heavens... Actually, we got this. We got this in the box. Is that whiskey? How do you know that? It's Irish whiskey. This is your birthright. Do you want some? - Yeah. - No, Stephen. What? He's 100% Irish. He should have some Irish whiskey. Okay, he's 92% Irish, and then he's 8% Viking. We're part Viking? Yeah, the parts that raped and pillaged their way through Ireland. - Stephen! - Jeez, Dad. What? - It's history. - Okay, fine. Just get two glasses and I'll pour you... Wait, so what is it? It's actually pretty decent bottle of hooch. It's booze. How does it taste? Well, it tastes a little bit like heaven and a little bit like hell. Okay. - Mom! - Mom. That's plenty. All right, here goes. Oh bubba, I'm so sorry. Can I have some more? No, thank you. - You okay? - I hate whiskey. It likes you. It does. Yep. I can't pour. My pour spell is broken. My God, have I ever told you guys the story - about how I met your mom? - Yes. Okay, fine. It's only the story of how you got to be here. So, you know, never mind. Oh, my God, I did not like you when I first met you. I didn't even notice you. You were so full of yourself! Oh, and he tried so hard to be noticed. Oh, my God. And then you did that thing. - I did, I did that thing. - Yes, you did that thing. Imagine if you hadn't done that thing. I would be who knows where with who knows who. My God, and I'd be right there with you, except totally without you. Aww. - Cheers to family, guys. - Oh, cheers. Love you guys. - Cheers. - Cheers. Yeah. - It's raining. - Terrific. Please tell me there's a fucking aspirin in there. Can you go get the kids up? Yeah. Come on, Wyatt, time to get up. - What was that? - What? What'd you just shove under there? Nothing. Nothing. - I'm gonna take a look. - Dad, it's nothing. - Wyatt. - Wait, no, Dad. - What the fuck was that? - I can explain. What the fuck was that? What is it? It's okay, really, I can explain. - Stop talking! - Stephen! - It's okay! - He was online! He's fucking chatting with somebody, right? - You're online? - Oh, my God. - Mom. - What did he do? - He's got his phone. - He has his what? Mom, come on! Did you go into the safe? Did you break into the safe? - Yes. - Are you insane? Mom, it's not that big a deal. Just let me explain. My God, will you stop talking? Who was that? Who were you just chatting with? - Well? - You told me to stop talking. Don't be a fucking smart ass. Who was that? - It was just a friend. - From where? She's from Chicago. - Wyatt. - Shut up, Sean. I'm sure you know all about this. - I didn't know. - Oh, tell me the truth. Do you have your phone too? - No. - Don't lie to us. Yes. - We're both online. - Sean! - They need to know. - God dammit, shit! We're talking to people all over the world. There's thousands of us. What, how? Like network set up all over the place. You guys wouldn't know about that. That's how it gets in here! - Dad! - Shut up. Do you know what you've done? Do know what kind of danger you've put us in? - It's fine. - Oh, it's fine. Yeah, 'cause no one even thinks it's real. Oh, it's not real, huh? Why don't tell that to your grandfather. You know what? Tell it to my friend Charlie Bishop, okay? Go tell him. - 'Cause I watched him die. - It's different now. These are like 3G networks at best. Just so we can talk to each other. I can't listen to this anymore. There's thousands of people communicating. They have been for months. And how long have you been doing it? Just a little while. - How long? - A week. - 10 days. - Why didn't you tell us? Because of this. We knew you'd freak out. There's whole parts of the country - back up and running again. - Don't listen to this. Jennifer goes to a school, an actual school. You can't listen to this. He could be infected already. We could all be infected by now! Have you seen it? Have you seen the schools and these cities back up and running? My friend Noah video chatted me the other day from a coffee shop. There were people in the background ordering. But if you were infected, how would you know that's real? That's what this does! Don't you understand? It steals reality right out from under you and traps you in this virtual version that looks and feels and sounds and smells just like the real thing, but it's not! In reality, you're some ravaged skeleton strapped to a fucking hospital bed. Dad, we're fine. You can see I'm fine, right? But I could already be infected. You've opened the door. You've let this in. Stephen, what if it's true? - I want your phone. - Dad, please! Give it to me! - And yours too. - I don't have a phone. Whatever it is that you're going online with, I want it and I want it now. - Dad, please just listen- - Go get it! What about your computers? - Can you get online with these? - No. If you're fucking lying to me. I'm not lying. That's it. My iPad? Sorry. What about your computer? That's it. - Please listen, Stephen... - Don't say it. Don't say it, 'cause I know what you're gonna say. Stephen, please. Please. Stephen. What if it's true? Standard monitoring protocol. It's gonna start with a rash behind the ears - and the back of the neck. - Stephen, please listen to me. You didn't see how they died! You didn't see how they fucking looked at me before they tried to rip their eyes out of their fucking skulls. Stephen, calm down. Just take a couple deep breaths. We both saw that text. That person was real. Yeah, but I could be infected. How long has this been going on? They say a week, but it had to be longer, right? I mean, they've been doing this behind our back. - You know what, fuck this. - No, don't! Come on, Stephen, we have talked about this. We always said that if the powers that be wanted to take full control, that this is how they would do it. Maybe, just maybe, this has been over for months, and we're stranded out here, we have no idea what's going on, how would we know? Control of what? We're just sitting here. Everything's delivered. Nothing's asked of us. I mean, we're not enslaved, we're just waiting. We're not enslaved? Stephen, I have a chip in the back of my neck. So do you, we can't leave this place. So we stay safe until they figure out how to fight this thing. Nobody's figuring out anything! Or they already have, and just like the kids said, we are just stupid for going along with this. Okay, all right, if this is some big master plan, what's the point? I mean, what are they taking from us? Everything. Maybe it's just control. Maybe that's all they want, because they can do it. Or what if they're just building an infrastructure that they need and we're just holding on until they do it for some new world order. God knows, I don't know what it is, but please, Stephen, listen to me. I have an idea, please. Please. Anna. Please listen to me, listen. Okay. We take the devices and we hide them where they won't find them. Okay, and then we'll do the monitoring protocol just like you said. It's a week, six days. And if none of us show signs, then you and I go online, or just one of us so that the other one can stay safe, okay? See what's really there. Find out what the hell is really going on. Just one time. And then we'll do the monitoring protocol for the person who went online, and if we're all okay, and if we stay safe, then we'll know, right? We'll know. Things are starting to get back to normal. We need to know. Please, Stephen. Promise. I won't. This is so dangerous, what we're about to do. You know that, right? - Oh, my God, that was the...? - Surprise. Holy shit. Now I know it's not an original chicken sandwich, but. I do not care. - Love you guys. - Love you too. I love this burger. Hey, not too late. Okay. - Good night. - Good night. I love you. I love you too. Do you wanna see what I'm building? I'm tired, Bub. You wanna show me tomorrow? - Sure. - Okay. I'm excited to see it. - Night. - Night, Mom. Not too late, okay? I'm pretty tired. - Seriously. - I know. Dinner was awesome. I'm glad you liked it. It was true. What we said before. Well, we'll figure it out, okay? I just don't wanna talk about it right now. Yeah. You sound really good. Thank you. - Night. - Good night. What day is it today? - Thursday. - Do you know the date? I don't know the date. I don't know the date either. Me either. What did you have for dinner last night? Burger and fries. Can you recall one detail about the dinner? You and Dad were smiling. Who gave the Gettysburg Address? Lincoln. Count backwards from 10 to one. Ten. Nine. Eight. Seven. Six. Five. Four. Three. Two. One. - What day is it? - Thursday. Who gave the Gettysburg Address? Lincoln. Count backwards from 10 to one. Ten. Nine. Eight. Seven. - Six. - Five. Four. Three. Sorry, two. One. Zero. You scared me. I'm sorry. I got this weird ingrown hair on the back of my neck. Well, jeez, I hope you live. Oh, I think I can soldier on. I'm going up. You coming? No, I think I'm gonna have a drink. Feel like having a drink. Do you want one? No, I'm tired. We could get drunk, fool around. I will definitely take a rain check. Okay. I'll be up in a minute. Come tuck me in. You know, you won't be asleep by the time I get up there. Just a night cap. All right. Well, don't be long. I won't. Steve? Shh. I hear the dog. I think she's out in the woods. What, what? What's happening? Gotta go check. Go back to sleep. You know, I could come with you, if you like. No, not yet. Okay. Hmm. Mom? Hey Bubba. You okay? I can't find your father. Well, it's been a while now. What? Don't you remember? Remember what? Dad's gone. He's dead. It's been six months. Why would you say that? Because it's true. Remember? That's why we're here. He started acting really strange. He started forgetting things, he started wandering around the apartment at night. He took apart the kitchen shelves. You called the hospital and they came and took him away. We haven't seen him since. You brought us here because you thought it was safer than Boston. - To see if we'd show signs. - Monitoring protocol. You remember, right? Yeah. Do you know what day it is? Tuesday. I'm worried about you. Do you need anything, Mom? I need your dad. What? I just feel bad. No, I'm okay, I'm good. Okay. Mom? - Mom? - Yeah. 47 is the answer, right? 47, that's really good, Wyatt. You okay? Yeah, I'm just feeling a little tired, that's all. We can do this later if you want. Yeah, I think I'll... Yeah, I think I'm gonna go take a nap. You hungry? Can I make you some lunch? - I'm okay. - Yeah, I'm fine. Okay. - Don't come any closer. - I'm not, I'm not. I'm standing right here. - Do you have any antibiotics? - What? Antibiotics. No, we don't have any antibiotics. I need... My boy. I left to get antibiotics, right? That's why I left. No, we don't have anything. You're the one with the dog? What? Yeah, I hear him sometimes, far off. I haven't heard him in a while. I'm sorry. I can't remember the last time I've spoken to someone else. We don't have anything that we can spare. How did you get out? I can set you free too. Quick, you won't feel anything, I promise. Stephen! - Stephen! - Hey! It's okay. I'm sorry. God bless. Stay safe. Stay safe. Come on, come on, come on, come on. Hey, Bub. - Hey. - Hey. Do you wanna see what I'm building? Sure. Okay. Well it's mostly finished by now, but this was just some random thing I came up with. One thing I'm most proud of is that the cockpit comes out, like here, like you can open this, and you can slide the cockpit like this, and you can get the pilot out, but you can also... Stephen! Stephen? Stephen. Stephen! Stephen! Stephen! Stephen! Stephen. Hello! Yes, we are here. This is the Witten family. M-A-6-3-9-6-4. This is Anna Witten, identification A-W-3-9-4-7-1. The others are here. Please, please wait. Sean. Sean, it's the call. Sean? Wyatt. Wyatt? Sean Witten, identification S-W-3-9-4-7-3. Where's Wyatt? Why are you hanging up? We need to get your brother and your father. We're not gonna have enough food. Hello? - It's just us. - Hello? It's just us, Mom. Why did you hang up the phone? They're here in this house somewhere. They are somewhere here. Mom, you're scaring me. Did you do this? What? Just tell me what's going on. There's nothing going on. It's just been us for months. You're lying. - Why are you lying? - Mom. What day is it? No, I remember. I remember... With your father, I was playing a game, and Wyatt. Wyatt. He was showing me his building, he was building Legos. If you try to remember, if you try and fight it, that helps. They say that if you try to hold onto something that feels real to you, you can beat it. Are you real? Yes, Mom. And Wyatt and Dad... You weren't feeling well. You couldn't tell if you were stressed or if you were getting sick, so we came down to the summer home. You made me drive, remember? I was afraid to, but you guided me the whole way. You remember that? Yeah. Yeah, I remember. It's just been us. I'm so sorry. Why are you sorry? Because I... Have I paid enough attention to you? Yeah. Mom, God, yes. I'm fine. I love you. I love you too. You okay? Could watch a movie or play a game or something. No... I'm okay, it's okay. Okay. Yeah, I think I'm gonna go lay down for a minute. Okay. I'll cook you dinner soon. We have a lot of nice things for dinner. Okay. Call you in a bit. Just leaves us three. Mr. Clayton, I think we should take a break for five minutes. Tempers seem to be running a little high. Aw, come on a minute, I was just starting to do good. Hello? Hello? Anybody there? Hello? All right, I'm gonna sign off. Anna? Stephen. Anna, where are you? - Are you at the hospital? - No, I'm here. I'm at the summer house. Where are you? The summer house. We're at the summer house. Where are you? I'm here. I'm at the summer house. I don't understand. We're here. Me and the boys, we're here at the summer house. Where are you? Are you okay? Is this some kind of joke? Wyatt! - Wyatt! - Stephen. Wyatt, did you do something to the computer? Stephen. - Well, come look at this! - Stephen! He's coming, just hang on one second. I love you. This doesn't make any sense. You're supposed to be... Where are you calling from? - I love you. - No, no, no, wait, wait. Everything's okay here. No, no, no, no, no, no! Stephen! Stephen! Oh, my God. What's happening... Fuck you. Wyatt. Wyatt? Wyatt? Honey, honey. Wyatt. Honey? You're not real. I remember. We're right here. I remember! I remember! I remember! Hold on, gimme a second, I gotta get on. - Hey, Mom. - Hey, there she is. How you feel, baby? Hey Mom. But yeah, no, so he's gonna say, I don't know what you're saying. I can't, Wyatt can probably explain it better. - Hey, Wyatt. - Wyatt! You look like you're feeling better. The doctor said was gonna be tough to talk for a couple of days. Was thinking about steaks tonight. What do you think about steaks?
