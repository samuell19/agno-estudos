Come. Dervis. -Unchain me, brother. Please. -Get back! Get back! Enjoy it. Like it’s your last meal. Hatice, baby’s water, please. I’m getting it. -Here you go, Kerem. -Thank you. Kerem, they’re here. Show them in. You said he’d keep the walls. I didn’t understand. It’s incredible. Wonderful. Look at the detail. What do you think? -It’s just what I wanted. -Beautiful. Hello. Hello. It turned out wonderfully. Didn’t I tell you? Leave everything to Kerem. He’ll handle it all. That’s what you told me. Kerem, it’s extraordinary. Thank you. I’m at a loss for words. I’m nearly in tears. It’s so full of life. Like everything’s breathing. Speaking of which... ...here you go. A bit of life for you. Excuse me? That’s a Kerem signature. He presents one to all the homes he decorates. I’ve got one too. It’s something... ...to remind you again and again that’s you’re alive, that you exist. But it’s hard to care for. To keep in bloom. It needs your attention. A tiny mistake, and you’ll lose it. Just like life. Okay. Okay. No, I’m not letting it... ...get me down. Okay. We’ll talk tomorrow. Are you home, dear? I found the perfect celeriac. Your favorite. Doctor Eda... ...says it’s negative. We’ll eat out, then. We can have celeriac tomorrow. Why get this upset? We’re not even half way through the treatment. I don’t understand how... ...when we want a child so badly... ...and all these women... ...keep having babies without a thought... ...and so many fathers never even kiss their kids... ...we can’t have children. It’s not fair. Yesim, the world’s not a fair place. Don’t let it upset you so much. Try to eat your dinner. Kerem. You want kids even more than me. I know that. Do you have to be so sensible? Do you have to be so normal? Don’t you feel like rebelling? By acting so normal... ...you make it more painful for me. I mean, yell. Break things. Do something. Maybe something will change. Like that? Let’s make a list tomorrow of our life changes. Don’t worry about it, sir. I’ll clean it up. Yesim. I’m using your first name. Like you asked me to. I’m changing the medication to increase your egg count. To avoid side effects, we didn’t... -...start with this treatment. -What side effects? The same as before, Kerem. But you’ll feel it more acutely, Yesim. Dizziness. Hot flashes. The same things. We prescribed Clomifene... ...to support the growth, release... ...and quality of eggs. But the treatment has failed. Now we’re increasing the dosage... ...so more eggs are released... ...and ready for fertilization. Will this increase the chance of success? I can’t say for certain. We’ll try it, Kerem. It’s a long process. We’ll take it step by step and won’t lose hope. Shall we get a coffee? We’re close to that café you like. Okay. We won’t. We’ll go to Assos this weekend, then. -Kerem-- -No, no... You already used your right of refusal. Assos, Assos, Assos. Nergis’ home cooking... ...complete silence, a fireplace... ...our favorite music. What else can I say? And it might even rain. Ah, my old friend. You’ll always be a child. See. Your companions love it here. I’ll plant some more. You’ll never get lonely. Get rid of that card. You’ve got half the deck. Is somebody waiting for it? Here, take it. Ah. Yes, Kerem? -How are you doing, Dervis? -Fine, just fine. Same as always. How are you? And Yesim? We’re both fine. -She sends her greetings. -Give her mine, too. We were wondering about you. We haven’t heard from you. Nergis said she missed you. She asked when you were coming. We talked about that today. Great. So, you’re coming? That’s great news. We’re leaving early tomorrow morning. Any problems with the house? No. Why would there be? It’s all ready for you. I’ll go check again in the morning. Don’t worry about it. We’re going to relax for a couple of days. Tell Nergis not to trouble herself. If she could prepare a dish or two, that’ll be enough for us. Okay, Kerem. Leave it to me. Have a safe trip tomorrow. Okay, brother. Do you need anything? No, son. Just arrive safe and sound. -That’s all I want. -Okay Dervis. Bye. Goodbye. Slow down, dear. What did he say? He says “hi”. I’ve noticed that... ...the further we get from Istanbul... ...the happier you get. Darling, I’ll be happy if you wear your seatbelt. Sorry. Kerem. -Village tomatoes. -Tomatoes? Over there. Okay. Don’t worry. We’ll get some. Welcome. -Hello. -Hello. -They’re from your field, right? -Yes. Ripe tomatoes. They’re beautiful. Do you want some? -Hello. -Hello. Welcome. Thanks. Get out of here! You little bastards! Do you work here? I’ve got peppers and eggplant. They’re nice too. There he is. The spy wanted by the FBI. Over. Roger that, commander. Over. He’s plotting to destroy the world. Over. Let’s fire the missiles, commander. Here are the coordinates. Coordinates received, commander. Over. We’re ready, commander. Attack! Hikmet! What’s going on now? Stop! Stop running away! I’m turning it on. No. Yes. They smell so good. I’m going to eat one. Without washing it? We’ve got water. Do you want one? Yagiz, this is my favorite pier. Go out on it. Darling. Kerem. Is anyone there? Be quiet. It’s coming. What are you saying, boy? Excuse me? Get away from me! Kerem! Calm down. You took out your drip. Come on. Hold onto me. Why did you get out bed? There was a man. His head was... He went, “shhh”. I went to get water. He took off his drip. Don’t get upset. There’s nothing to fear. I’ll handle this. Mom, there was a boy. A boy. There’s no boy. There’s nobody. Let me help you into bed. Don’t worry. It’s the medication. Hallucinations are normal. Come on, dear. Tell me everything you remember. Don’t hold back. We were going from Istanbul to Assos. I... ...was going 80 or 90. Could we do this a little later? -We’ll try again when he’s calm. -Thank you. I was driving to Assos from Istanbul. Driving about 90. -It was the afternoon. -I had my seatbelt on. I braked hard. I was coming from the olive grove. A tree-lined road. The ruling. Based on the testimony and evidence... ...and the fact the defendant... ...was not speeding... -...defendant to be freed pending trial-- -Murderer! God damn you! God damn you! My boy’s dead. My boy! You’re sending me away too soon. I should stay. Anyhow. What are you going do all alone? Mom, you’ve been here for two months. You’ve got your own life. It’s not that I don’t want you. Leave me on my own for a while. I’ll be all right. I need time alone. Okay then. As you wish. But if you get depressed,... ...go outside, cry, yell,... ...invite your friends over, distract yourself. Being alone is no good. When we lost your father I was never alone. Other people help ease the pain. In the end, healing comes from inside. Find whatever it takes to heal, wherever it is. Be well. I promise. I’ll be fine, Mom. Finish the food in the fridge. I made stewed vegetables. I know you like them. Invite Yagiz over. He’s a good guy. Not just because he’s your partner. He stayed with you in the hospital. All your friends visited. But Yagiz was different. He came every day. He called when he couldn’t come. If only his feet didn’t smell. No joking. Finish up that food. Your taxi’s here. Your face is so thin. I miss you so much. I miss you like crazy. Go away! Kerem, it’s me. It’s me, Yagiz. What’s the matter? Are you okay? I thought you were... Thought I was what? If I were a burglar, would you have killed me? Berrin called me. Even if she hadn’t, I would have come. I’m glad I came. Finally. Hey! Are you okay? Buddy... ...look, I know... ...it’s easy to say... ...but come back to us. It’s not what you think... Listen to this. Beer, chips and a movie... ...and if you want... ...a couple matches on Play Station. But only if you play to win. Or we could get dressed and go out. Get some air. Say something. I’m going to tell you something... ...but you won’t believe it. That’s nuts! Sorry. Forgive me, but that sounds... ...I mean, what can I say? Kerem, you’re forcing me to use clichés. Your mind’s playing tricks on you. You’re not yourself. You’re seeing things. That’s all I can say. Put yourself in my place. What would you think? So what does that make me? Am I some character in a story... ...who won’t believe in ghosts and ends up dying a painful death? I knew you’d say this. -Kerem, what we need is some coffee. -Leave me alone! I’m sober. I didn’t see a ghost, okay? Okay. I’ll shut up. I can’t forget her. Sometimes I wish... ...it could be like in the movies. If only they’d wipe away some of the memories. Take away the pain. We made each other a promise back in school. Before we took on... ...life’s troubles and battles... ...we were going to visit our grandfathers’ homeland. Do you remember? We, the children of immigrants,... ...were going to swim in the sea in Dubvrovnik. Taking nothing but... ...a backpack and a camera. No matter what. I said you’d back out. And you said I would. The fear that the other one would back out... ...just egged us on more. Back when we were flat broke... ...and living on beans and rice. But we were dreaming big, Kerem. And then what happened? We became interior designers. We made money. We travelled the world, for work! But we never made it to nearby Dubrovnik. It was just a dream. It came to nothing. Life beat our dreams. Listen. Let’s grab our backpacks and hit the road. Let’s go to Dubrovnik. Right now! What do you say to beating life? Come on! I’m not strong enough. I’m not strong. Good morning. You’re busy for this time of morning. Did you dream about washing dishes? Have you had coffee? Shall I get you one? Huh? Leave it. Why bother now? Shall I get you a coffee? Yagiz, answer me. -Enough! -What’s going on? Yagiz? You were over there. Over there? I’m here. Don’t you see me? Kerem, nobody’s over there! Look, Kerem. Stop feeling guilty because... ...some kid jumped in front of your car. His mother should have... ...taught him better. Stop blaming yourself, Kerem. You’ll go crazy! You’ll lose it because some village boy-- I miss you so much. I miss you like crazy. What’s going on in this house? Is his father stalking you, Kerem? Something weird is going on but... ...you need to get out of that house before you go nuts. Go stretch out on a beach chair, open up a book... ...and don’t see anyone for a while. -I’ll get it. -No, I got it. Have something to eat before you go. It’s a long trip. I’ll go now. Nergis, he’s here. Run. Dervis. Kerem, my boy. Welcome. Welcome. I’ll get your suitcase. -Nergis. -Welcome. -Come on in. -Not now, thanks. All right then. Have a safe trip. Thank you very much. Come on in. It’s delicious, Nergis. I feel cleansed. -Enjoy it. -Enjoy it. I was going to make pumpkin... ...but they’re moldy this year. They don’t taste good. That’s the least of our worries. We haven’t touched a thing. We didn’t move anything. But if you’d like... You were going to quit. You’re coughing in the morning. Dervis... ...how is the boy’s, Atakan’s, mother doing? She’s fine. It’s all been forgotten. It’s fate. What can you do? Tell me. How is she? She cried and mourned... ...but she’s better now. It’s fate. What can you do? I wasn’t going to say this. May God forgive me. That boy was a troublemaker. The kind who carries a stick. He clubbed his classmates over the head. And that’s the least of it. His teachers all had enough. He kept missing school. He kicked Granny Halime in the leg... ...and brought her to her knees. She couldn’t get up for two hours. -Her little finger. -He broke her little finger. I’ll come out and say it. God forgive me. That boy was headed for a bad end. His father beat them both. Sorry to say it, but that Kudret’s a bastard. And he was taking something. If it was alcohol, okay. But he was taking pills. “Bonzai” I think they call it. That’s what he was taking. His wife’s screams filled the village square at night. Can you imagine? So that’s why their boy... ...Atakan turned out that way. You reap what you sow. We all consoled Aysun, the wife. We help her all we can. People in these parts do that. -Don’t worry. -It’s fate. So... ...now... ...the worst is over. Look to the future from now on. I’ll pay the blood money he wants. Let’s have a look at the garden. Why bring this up now? You’re going to win the court case. I’ll still pay him off. It’s up to you. Here’s what we’ll do then. Lay low. Don’t make him angry. I’ll go and find Kudret. I’ll get his bank details. I’ll handle everything and bring you the receipt. Here you go. There’s no need. What are you doing? No, not like this. This money... No, son. If you give him this money, he’ll just want more. This is all wrong. Okay then. Here’s what we do. I don’t trust Kudret. I’ll deposit this money in his account. And I’ll get some kind of receipt. You’ll win the case anyway. Hopefully he’ll leave us alone then. I’m not doing this for them. It’s for the boy. Oh, son. It’s your conscience, isn’t it? God knows you’re innocent. You’ve got nothing to be ashamed about. Money won’t solve anything. I’m fed up with feeling guilty. That thing... ...I want that thing to leave me alone! To stop following me. What thing? Kerem? Don’t say I’m crazy. And don’t say I’m seeing things. For a while now... ...I’ve been seeing that boy. His ghost. Or him in different forms. Not in a dream. In the middle of the day. He comes in different forms, but I know it’s him. He found me at the hospital and then at home. But I ran away and came here. Maybe he won’t find me here. I feel it. Maybe he’s here now. Maybe he’s listening to us. He won’t leave me alone. He wants revenge. He wants revenge. I know... ...you don’t believe me. Why wouldn’t I? There are other worlds not visible to the eye. Of course I believe that. I’m done. Let’s go. I keep this in my bag. Here. I’ll get another amulet. If it happens again... ...pray with your heart, not your lips. Come on. Get some rest. Call me whenever you want. See you in the morning. Thanks. Good evening. I didn’t want it. Kudret did. To hell with his money. Dervis, will it bring my boy back? I don’t want it! Give it back! That money’s no use to me. Join us, Kudret. Anything wrong? I heard that bastard’s here. Sit down, Kudret. Let’s talk. Tell them I said no. I won’t be able to work for a while longer. You’re still getting paid, aren’t you? So don’t worry about it. Bye. I’m fine, Mom. I’m reading a book. I’m fine. Everything’s okay. Alright? Don’t worry. No, nothing’s wrong. Go to bed. Darling. Darling. I’m dreaming, aren’t I? What does it matter? I’m here with you. I missed you so much. Don’t go. I don’t want to wake up. It was a dream, that’s all. Kerem? What's wrong? Kerem? You’re burning up. Go take a shower and cool off. Kerem, what happened? It won’t leave me alone. It found me here, too. Dervis is coming. You can talk to him. Go take a shower. Lower the fever. What happened, son? Shall I tell Berrin? No, don’t call my mother. He says he wasn’t drinking. He had a tea. He was staring at the floor like he’d lost his mind. It was awful. And he’d been crying. Shall we take him to Granny Zisan? Wait. Let’s have a talk first. Good morning. Good morning. -Come. -Have a seat. I got fresh eggs from Hatice. She says hi. I’ll make scrambled. With cheese? Sure. How’s your fever? I put an aspirin there. I’ll take it. How did it go? I talked to Kudret last night. I took care of the bank this morning. Good. If it weren’t for you, I’d lose my mind. -Thank you. -It’s nothing. How are they? Fine. Just fine. I had some words for Kudret. I told him... ...that if he’s taking the money... ...he should wise up... ...and buy a truck so he can set up... ...his own delivery business. He said okay. We’ll see what he does. Shall we visit the grave today? Let’s do it. Have something to eat first. Let’s eat together. We’ve already had breakfast. But I’ll keep you company. What do you want, kid? Tell me what you want. It wasn’t my fault. Nobody could have saved you. Tell me what you want. What do you want? What are you doing? That’s sinful. Can he answer from there? He comes out at night. Did we come here to argue with the earth? Let’s get going. That’s a sin. Come on. Listen to me. There’s a village up on the mountain. We call it Cakmaklar. It had 20-25 houses. But almost everyone has left. They all moved. It’s Nergis’ village. We moved when I was little. A woman lives there. She’s called Granny Zisan. She never left her village. She went blind when she was young. Some say illness caused it. Others say there was no reason. And some say their house was struck by lightning. Anyway, it’s all in the past. After going blind... ...she started seeing things. Things we don’t see. But she knows us. We visit her often. She has a little grandson. Ömer. He’s been unfortunate too. But that’s another story. Granny Zisan’s hands,... ...face and heart have healing powers. She might have a remedy for us. She’s a healer. Dozens have blessed her for helping them. Those things you told us about... ...those strange things. Maybe Granny Zisan can help. No matter what you say... ...me and Nergis are going to go home and pack a bag. We’ll get some food. Get ready and we’ll leave. The fresh air will do us good. Is that everything? No. There's a few more things. Get something for the boy. Chocolate will make him happy. The people here stay clear of Granny. They don’t like her. There’s a reason. They say she has spirits and jinn. They’re scared of her. But they visit when they need her. When I say “jinn”... ...I’m not talking about evil spirits. Whatever. You’ll see for yourself. What’s this? Rocks and things. Anyway, we’re almost there. We’re supposed to call. He’s out with the sheep. Does Granny have a cellphone? No. Ömer has one. She doesn’t, of course. How could you think that? Sometimes there’s no reception. You’ll have to do it the old-fashioned way. Let’s see if you still have strong lungs. There’s no reception. Uncle Dervis. Auntie Nergis. Look how happy he is. Poor thing. He never sees anyone. You little lion. Little lion. My little lamb. Your Aunti Nergis adores you. Ömer, I’m Kerem. Shake his hand, boy. Come on. Granny’s waiting. -Let’s go. -Let’s go. -I’ll get that. -No, that’s okay. Come along. Come on. Granny Zisan. Nergis? We’re here, Granny. Welcome, my dear. Granny the healer. Take it. Wait. Let Nergis explain why we came. We’ll go in later. Let’s sit down. I want to tell you something. It’s not used to strangers. But don’t worry. It won’t do anything. Ömer, get a hammer. Let’s fix this. Come. Dervis. Okay. Kerem. Come on. Come on, Kerem. Come inside. Get real close. Granny sees with her hands. Come closer. Don’t be scared. Give me your face. You’ve been sad. So sad, poor thing. Your heart is wounded. So full of pain. Poor thing. Let it all out. Let it go. Let go. I understand. Of course I do. I understand. What followed you here? It’s right over there. The worst of the worst. Ömer... ...I wish I had some other things. But I left home in a hurry. I brought what I had. Take it. That’s a nice car. Go on, Ömer. Take it. Have you got a driver’s license? You do know how to read? Of course he does. He went to school for two years. He couldn’t go last year. But he’ll go next year. He’s clever. Here. Take it. Dinner’s ready. Those beans smell great. Kerem... ...we can bring the table inside if you want. There’s no need. Come sit down. Pass me your bowls. Granny says... ...she’ll chase it away... ...and you’ll be free, God willing. But Granny has a request. When this is over, you’ll agree to her condition... ...without question. Agreed? Agreed. Ömer... ...could you read outside for a little bit? Stay by the door. The thing following you... ...comes from the other side. Out of that dark place. There’s a boy? The boy who made you sad. That opened a door that should never be opened. He haunts you. He wants revenge. But he can’t enter this house. He fears me and mine. My guardians are good. Don’t fear them. But the creature outside! It has its eye on you! I see it. But it appears to you... ...only when it wants to. To frighten you. If you saw it all the time, you wouldn’t get frightened. Before, it was small. The more frightened you are, the bigger it grows. It feeds on your fear. Feeds and grows. You mustn’t be afraid. I know what it wants. It wants revenge. But not in this other world. On the other side. If it kills you... ...it can’t make you join it. Because it is in hell. Your soul will travel to the light. It won’t find you there. So it wants to drive you crazy. It wants to make you sin. If you go crazy... ...you will kill us, then yourself. -I don’t-- -No. Then you will pass to the darkness. It’s the darkness that it wants. It will find you there... ...and cause you to suffer. Let’s all go to bed. I’m very tired. Its anger tires me. It feeds on your fear. Feeds and grows. You mustn’t be afraid. That’s easy to say. But I haven’t got any guardians. What? -Wake up. It’s an earthquake. -What? It’s an earthquake. Ömer, wake up. Get up. Quiet! Up there. The first one you killed. It seeks blood for blood. I told you. It wasn’t his fault. The boy dashed in front of the car. This is no boy. It isn’t a boy. It’s the one you killed earlier. Bekir! His name is Bekir! I know you, Bekir! Bekir! Aren’t you going to tell us? Tell us what you did. Not in front of the boy. Don’t look at me like that. It’s hard to explain. So hard. We were living in Emirgan. Dad had just passed away. Mom and I were trying to go on. I had a best friend. Taner. We lived in the same building. He helped me through hard times. Out back was a kind of outbuilding. That’s where the bastard stayed. Bekir. He’d moved to the neighborhood a couple months earlier. Out of nowhere. Helter-skelter. Like he was running from something. He kept his head down, never talked. Never looked anyone in the eye. He stayed in the shadows. But dogs could tell how rotten he was. They’d bark at him. He’d been in trouble with the law... ...but nothing was ever proven. Lots of molestation charges. That’s why he kept drifting. We learned all that later. Afterwards. After it happened. After it was done. He was a deviant to the core. He couldn’t help it. Turns out he was after Taner. It was autumn. One day... ...Taner went missing. We were at my aunts' on the island. We spent the night. When we got home, it was like a bomb had dropped. Taner went to play arcade games and never came home. Nobody knew where he was. His mother kept asking me. Like she’d lost her mind. She kept saying I had to tell her if I knew anything. I knew but I couldn’t say. I knew it deep in my heart. He’d done something to Taner. The police questioned him, too. They didn’t find anything suspicious. I could only think about one thing. How could he go on living... ...like he hadn’t done anything? It wasn’t right. I couldn’t believe it. Something happened that night while we were at Taner’s. I don’t know how to explain it. Some people are there... ...at just the right moment. For that special moment. She had the face of an angel. Her name was Aysegul. There was an abandoned house out back. Nobody ever went there. She’d seen that man leaving it. She was scared in that big crowd. That's why she didn’t tell anyone she’d seen Bekir. He had one of those snow hats. He was wearing a ski mask. So Taner wouldn’t recognize him. That man who lives out back. It was him. Taner was lying there. Maybe he’d struggled... ...and it was an accident. But that bastard killed Taner. I waited. I tried to put on his shoes. Like if I managed that... ...everything would go back to normal. It didn’t. And then... Now I can say what happened. Nobody knew what I was doing. Nobody ever found out. As though the world stood still, the whole world went quiet. I was the only one alive. As though everyone went quiet so I could do it. All I remember... ...is that it was hot and he was sleeping. Maybe he’d planned to run away the next day. To Sisli or to Besiktas. He seemed to sense me coming. He turned and looked. He didn’t yell or fight back. Just looked at me. I was glad he saw me. Saw his executioner. It was the only way my rage could cool. Nobody suspected anything. Nobody cared who killed him. The police asked a couple questions. People were indifferent. Their uncaring side won out. Don’t be upset, Kerem. Nobody can understand. You have to live it yourself. Kerem... ...your phone. Where have you been, Kerem? I’ve called you 50 times. I’m fine. Don’t worry. Reception is bad here. Aren’t you in Assos? No. I mean, yes. We’re in Cakmaklar village. What village? I’m fine. I’m with Dervis. In a mountain village. What are you doing up there? Winter sports? You’re out of your mind. Kerem, you don’t sound well. I’m coming. No, don’t come. This is a kind of cleansing for me. Look at it that way. What are you talking about? Have you founded a cult? Kerem, can you hear me? The connection’s bad. I’ll call you later. Hello! Which village? Why are you yelling? Granny said... ...he should stay outside tonight... ...or the other one won’t come. She needs him to be the bait. We have to chain him outside. -Ömer? -I’m going to the outhouse. They whispered in my ear. They told me what happened before. It happened like this. The dead boy misses his mother. He wants to be with her. He lost his way in the darkness. He opened a door he shouldn’t have. Bekir rushed out the door. He followed the boy and found you here. Now the boy is terrified. Terrified of the dark. God willing, your salvation will soon come. I was really little. They were driving a tractor... ...to a wedding. That road over there... ...is where they rolled down the hill. You were still young. You weren’t that upset, were you? You didn’t understand. Don’t you get bored here? I don’t know. There’s Cano and Granny. I watch TV. I gather the sheep and goats In the evening. Help me gather my wits. I think I’m losing them. You’re losing your wits? Don’t laugh. They’ve taken to each other. There’s no time left. Just a little. I have only a little time. So we can’t make a mistake this evening. When I called him by name, Bekir ran and hid. We need to bring him back. The scent of Kerem’s fear will lure Bekir. Kerem has to think we’re chaining him for real. Or he won’t be afraid. He must think it’s real. Dervis will have to turn on him. There’s no other way. Put a bit in his tea. The nice thing about the toilet is it’s outside. I just tried it out. It’s nice in good weather... ...but hard in the winter. You’re used to it. Are you reading that book? What page are you on. Five. -Enjoy your chat. -Thanks, Nergis. -Here you go, Kerem. -Thanks. Do you want one, too? The middle house was the headman’s. And Hatice’s family lived up there. They moved to Assos, too. We were the only ones left. I went to first grade in the other village. But that school closed, too. Granny wants me to be in school... ...but I can’t leave her alone here. I’ll take that if you’re done. Thanks. You didn’t get any sleep. Go stretch out inside. I feel sleepy. What did I tell you? It’s the fresh air. Come along. Sorry. I feel so heavy. That’s normal. Dervis? Am I a bad person? What did I do to deserve this? Yesim. Where are you, Yesim? Dervis? Am I dreaming? Unchain me. Would you give me my phone? Would you give me my phone? Are you out of your mind? It must be my mother. She’ll worry herself sick. It wasn’t your mother. Unchain me! Nergis. Nergis! Ömer! Granny, let’s free him. I feel bad for him. It’s for his own good. Don’t feel bad. Why’d you chain me? Because of what I confessed? Didn’t you say I was justified? That was then. I was acting. What else could I do? You’re a murderer. I wish you hadn’t put my daughter through school. And we shouldn’t have accepted your money. I’m going to call the police. They’ll come and get you. Dervis, this isn’t you talking. You wouldn’t do this. What’s going on? Tell me! Granny went into a trance. She saw what to do. If we... ...give you to that demon... ...it will spare our lives. If not, it will kill us all. And Ömer too! Are you certain? Maybe she’s wrong. It’s between me and that thing. She’s never been wrong. We can go somewhere. A place with people. -It’ll be okay. -No. It’ll follow us. Are you going to sacrifice me? You got us into this. You’ll get us out of it! There’s no such thing. I created it all in my head. Did you ever see the thing haunting me? There’s no such thing! You can’t fool me. See it! The house was shaking last night. See what? We’re in a village. It was a landslide. An earthquake. You’re chaining me over something you can’t even see? Well why are you scared then? Okay, there’s no problem. We’ll wait until morning. Then I’ll call the police. All right then. Go away. I’ll wait right here. We’re not leaving. We’re waiting for it to get dark. We’ll hand you over. It should see that. And when it comes... ...Granny will say she wants nothing to do with you. That’s why we’re waiting. Then we’ll go. But we’ll leave you here. In the dark. It loves the dark. Oh, Kerem! Where are you going? To get some food. Night is coming. As you see. I have to go to the bathroom. Just pick a spot. I don’t mean I have to pee. Like I said, pick a spot. Go ahead. You again? -Hello. -Hello. -Welcome. -Thank you. How's it going? There’s a village around here. Cakmak. -You mean “Cakmaklar”. -That’s it. Cakmaklar. Let me enter it here. What’s the easiest way to get there? Why are you going there? Nobody lives there. Or are you visiting Granny Zisan? I’m looking for Dervis. Maybe you know him. How do I get there? -It takes an hour from here. -Okay. -But it’s a tricky road. -Okay. Follow that street. -Through town? -Through town. When you reach the next village... This evening... ...no matter what... ...hide here... ...and don’t come out. -All right? -All right. My beloved grandson. Dervis. Come. -Unchain me, brother. Please. -Get back! Get back! Enjoy it. Like it’s your last meal. Hide quick. Don’t come out. Dervis, get Cano. Take me to him. It’s time. Come on, Cano. I’m here, Granny. I’m calling my guardians. They’ll hold onto my arms. My soul will leave me. My flesh will remain. Don’t be afraid. And don’t interfere. Dad. What are you doing? Get going! Hang on! Don’t go, Dad. I’m going to be freed. What’s going on? Ah... ...it’s Zisan. You witch. It’s you, isn’t it. You hag. Dad. What are you doing? Don’t go! What have you done? Can you hear me? What should I do now? Nergis. Free me. Unchain me. What’s Dervis done to you? Protect Ömer at least. That poor boy. The road going to Cakmaklar. How do I know? There must be only one road. I checked his pulse. He’s alive. But he’s unconscious. It’s coming. Granny, it’s coming! It’s coming! It’s coming! It’s hump... ...the boy’s on its hump. What’s going on? Where have I ended up? Sorry, brother. An ambulance is on the way. -Granny, what should we do? -Don’t interfere! Let Kerem look at it... ...and remember his hatred. Granny, protect Ömer! Granny, protect Ömer! Die! Die! I’ll kill you 100 times if I have to. You abused all of them? You who is damned to hell. Those poor children. Have you no conscience? You made their lives a living hell. Their souls trapped in darkness. You don’t realize what you’ve done. Your heart is black and rotten. You must realize. You must see your evil through another person’s heart. It’s the only way. I'm ready to give my heart. I'm ready, God. Hear me, Kerem. My condition is this:... ...Take care of Ömer. I entrust him to you. Granny! Kerem, are you okay? Are you okay? Forgive us, Kerem. We did what Granny asked. Granny. Granny! Wake up, Granny. Wake up, Granny. Kerem, are you okay? Can you hear me? Dervis? Dervis, what happened here? Don’t be scared. There’s another life you can't see. I'm there. Life is everywhere, always. Forever. Life. Life. Life. Life. Life. You said life was everywhere. You were the best thing in my life. I don’t know how many lives I’ll have or in what forms. But I want you in all of them. With me in all of them. Wait for me... ...in another life. Yes... ...we will patiently wait a long time to be reunited. I’ve been entrusted with someone. I’ll wait for him to grow up. A new beginning. A new life. Dervis and Nergis... ...look where we are. How’s Cano? Make a video and send it.
