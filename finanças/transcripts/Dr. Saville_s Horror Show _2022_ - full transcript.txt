(rain pouring) (people murmuring) (thundering) (people murmuring) (Airport PA speaking indistinctly) (thundering) - [Wife] You're going to miss Thanksgiving. - I'm sorry, baby. They shut down the runway. Until the storm lets up, I'm stuck here. - [Wife] Do they have any idea when they'll reopen? - I don't know. They've got me on standby. - [Wife] The kids are gonna be so disappointed. Are you there? - I'm here. I know they will be, baby. Trust me, I would rather be there with you. Is James still awake? - [Wife] He's already asleep. He tried to wait up for you. Michael? - Sorry. - [Wife] Are you okay? - I'm just really tired. Can I call you in the morning? - [Wife] Okay, sweetheart. I love you. - I love you too. - [Bartender] Gin and tonic, extra lime, from the lady. - May I? - Of course, yeah. - Hi, I'm Jenna. - Michael. Thank you for the drink. - You just looked like someone who could use one. Rough day? - Long day. It's about to get longer if this storm doesn't let up. - Where are you heading? - Burbank. Eventually. - It's gonna be a while. You know, my place is nearby. If you wanna come over for a real drink instead of this watered down crap? - I shouldn't. I'm marr... I should stick around in case a flight opens. - Mm. - I tell you what. I'm gonna take myself to the lady's room. I'll give you a couple of minutes to think about it. There's no reason you can't have some fun before you go home. - I wish I could. (ominous instrumental music) (ominous instrumental music) - [Dr. Saville] Tick-tock. Tick-tock. (metal clanging) Tick-tock. - Who's there? - The clock is ticking, Michael. Are you ready to talk yet? - Who are you? - People call me Dr. Saville. What am I? Well, that depends on you. I could be your angel. Or your demon, or, I could be something so much worse. I'm feeling generous today, so I'm gifting you a limited number of questions, so we can get to know each other a bit better. So think carefully before speaking. - I don't understand. Where am I? - That's two questions. - Who are you? - [Evil Dr. Saville] That's three! Don't push me, Michael. This will not end well for you. - (Dr. Saville) You are asking all the wrong questions. Where you are is inconsequential. Who I am is, also, inconsequential. For now. - How do you know who I am? - (Evil Dr. Saville) Wrong! (grunts in pain) Look at what you made me do! - (Dr. Saville) Oh. I'm sorry, Michael. Sometimes... Sometimes I lose control. I'm trying to make this easy on you. There's a part of me that wants to let you go. There's another part that wants to destroy you. Who wins? That depends on you. I'm good either way, although the latter option is way more fun. For me at least. - Please let me go. - You are still not understanding the rules, Michael. I will give you the answers you want if, if you ask the right questions. But if you keep blabbering on about... Where am I? Who are you? And there are plenty of intricate ways of using this. Some are just less pleasant than others. She can attest to that. (Evil Dr. Saville) So, I will ask you one more time. What is the right question? - Why am I here? - (Dr., Saville) About fucking time. Now we're getting somewhere. I knew I could get through to you. - Please, please. Please, let me go. No, I'll give you anything you want. - And then you fuck it up again. - Am I dead? (screams in pain) - (Evil Dr. Saville) If you were dead, would you feel that? (groans) - (Dr. Saville) So, no, you're not dead. Think of this as an, out of body experience. - Please, I have a family. - So did I. And no one gave a shit about taking that from me. I used to be like you. Weak. A victim. But, the path to redemption has to begin with suffering. Oh, you should get that looked at. - I have money. I will pay you. Whatever you want. - Oh money? - Yeah, how much do you need? - I don't need money. I don't want money. What I want is a confession. Can you give that to me, Michael? - A confession? I haven't done anything. - (Evil Dr. Saville) Liar! I know who you are, Michael. I know your kind. You always want more. You're not content with what you have. And where did that get you? Sitting here in front of me. The same place everyone ends up. Now, tell me why you're here! - I don't know! I don't know! - Yes, you do. - No, I promise you. I don't know why I'm here. - (Dr. Saville) Then you do not need to be talking. (gurgling in pain) I want to show you something. Pay attention to the image, Michael. I'm going to tell you a story. (ominous out of tune accordion music) (static buzz) - [Police Officer] Put the fucking gun down! - Hello? (man screams) (gun fires) Fuck! - Are you okay? - I think I'm gonna be sick. - From the call or from the wedding stress diet? - Both. - Mm. So I'm guessing you don't want the donuts that Josh brought in? (police siren wailing) (coughs) (ominous instrumental music) - Mel? - What? - This flier? Weight loss program? - I didn't put that there. - [Anna] Then who did? - I don't know. I didn't see anyone come by. - I'm not that desperate. Ah. (zips) (mellow instrumental music) What's that? - That is a Cestoda Artificialis. It's a tapeworm. Artificial tapeworm to be precise. - A tapeworm? - [Dr. Blaum] A tapeworm. - Are you kidding me? - A bioengineered tapeworm. - Tomato, tomato. It's a bug and, judging by the fact it's in pill form, I'm guessing you want me to swallow it. - You know the tapeworm diet has been around since the Victorian age, and it's regained popularity in recent years. I do understand your trepidation, there's a certain inherent risk and possibly crippling side effects. - Gee, I can't think why. Um, thanks for your time but... Doctor, you really need to work on your sales pitch. - Always been dramatic advancements in biotech weight support, even for those who typically don't qualify for other programs. Here, take a look. - You really expect me to swallow this? And then what happens? - It's programmed to die when you reach your weight loss goal. The worm is engineered to consume only it's targeted weight. So it's perfectly safe. - Yeah, but how does it know how much to eat? - By the worm size. - Oh. - Now the small ones remove five pounds. The larger ones up to 30. - Wait a second. Wait a minute. You're saying if swallow this, I lose five pounds? - Or more. That's a 30-pound worm. - Oh. - But, only with my approval. I'm not gonna give you this one. I'm concerned about your wedding goals as well as you are, but I'm also concerned about your health. I want you to stay healthy. I'm gonna give you the-- - The 25? - 15-pound dosage. - Refills? - Then it wouldn't be 15, would it? - Ah. I almost had you. - [Whitney] I'm sorry, you did what? - The doctor said it was perfectly safe, Whitney. - And you didn't think this to discuss this with me first? I mean we are getting married, or did that slip your mind? - You wouldn't have agreed. - Jesus, you think? That doesn't tell you something? (spraying) - What are you doing? Hello? Can you look at me for a minute? - I am killing ants. (spritzing) Parasitic little fuckers hate ammonia. - Look, I'm doing this for the both of us. I just want to be perfect for the wedding. - Don't put this on me. - I'm not. - What if something goes wrong? - It won't. - You're not making any sense. I... I'm the rash and reckless one. You, you're the safe and fucking boring one. - I am not boring. - Baby, you alphabetize the canned goods. - So, that's not boring, that's being practical. - Baby, that's the epitome of boring. - Yes, says the woman killing ants with window cleaner. - This, this isn't boring. This. This is fucking genius. (spritzing) Little shit. Hey, hey, watch your step. I kinda went crazy with the glass cleaner. It's like the... Fuckers are breeding in front of me. (mellow instrumental music) (pill bottle closes) (birds chirping) - Babe, I'm down a pound! - [Whitney] That's great, baby. I still think you're an idiot. (erasing) (melodious instrumental music) (erasing) - Oh, it's going. It's going. Oh! Oh. Oh, score, girl, and I got a week to spare. - Mm. Congrats, my love. - Mm-hmm. - Let me fix this. - You know-- - Fix this. - I got this side. - Mm-hmm. - All right, what do you think? - I think you should know that you weigh less in the morning. (laughs) - Seriously? You're such a bitch. Get off me. - Isn't that why you love me? - No, I love you because you bring me coffee. - Baby, I didn't bring you coffee. - Hm. Well that's a shame. Because when I'm all thin and single, I'll be looking all good-- - Girl, that's cold. - Mm-hmm. - That's why you love me. - Yeah. Come here. That ass. (laughter) I love it. - For someone trying to lose weight, you sure are slaughtering that muffin. And that sandwich. And that other sandwich. - This tapeworm diet is the fucking bomb, yo. I mean, I lost the weight, and I keep eating and eating and eating, it's not coming back. None of it. - Must be nice. And Whitney is okay with this? - No. She still think I've an idiot, but she'll come around, I'm sure. - [Melissa] I thought you were the rational one in the relationship? - Mm. You know you should try it. - What, being rational? (mocking laugh) I'll pass, thanks. I'm just surprised that you went through with it. And you're sure there aren't any side effects or risks? - Absolutely none. Oh, other than I can eat whatever I want whenever I want. I think it's a win-win situation. - I just never thought Whitney would be the voice of reason. - Mm. End of days, my friend. End of days. - Not hungry? Couldn't be because of your binge-fest at breakfast this morning, could it? Melissa told me. - It smells bad. - You're kidding? This? This smells amazing. - [Tapeworm] Eat it. - What did you say? - I didn't say anything. - You just said... - I didn't... (Anna vomiting) Hey. Are you... Are you okay in there, sweetheart? (Anna retches) (toilet flushes) Hey. Hey beautiful. How are you feeling? - Gross. I'm gonna go lay down for a little bit. (ominous instrumental music) - Hey. How are you feeling? - Like shit. - Yeah. - I think I ate something bad. - You're all clammy, babe. Do you need me to go to the store for some, some Ibuprofen? - [Tapeworm] I told you to feed. - Huh? - Do you need me to go to the store, babe? - No, I think I need to just rest a little more. - Do you need anything? - I could use a hug. - Here. - [Tapeworm] Do not deny me. - Oh shit. - What? What, what? - My finger. - Oh fuck, shit. You need a Band-Aid. Hold on. Um... Hey, does it hurt? - No. Not really. - Christ. - Oh. - It's all right. Thanks. - Yeah. You go lay down, get some rest. I am going to call your doctor for the nausea. Do you know your his number? - It's on the flier on the counter. - [Tapeworm] I told you to feed. (groans) I told you to feed. You need to eat. I said you need to eat. (mellow instrumental music) - Mm! (mellow instrumental music) (birds chirping) - Mm. Hey. Hey! Babe. Honey. - Mm? - Hey. Are you okay? - What happened? - Well, for one, your appetite returned. (chuckles) What the hell? You ate my breakfast. Ass. Come on. Let's get you cleaned up. Come on. (laughs) - You look like shit. Are you feeling okay? - I feel better than I look. - That's good, cause you look fucking awful. You're not contagious, are you? - Hell no. - Good. So, how's the fridge doing? Whitney got a big ass mouth. - Yeah, but she loves you. And she's worried about you. - I'm fine. - Hungry? - No. - [Tapeworm] Liar! - Are you sure you're okay? - I can't keep anything down. It's like the food just, is not agreeing with me at the moment. (groans) I'm just gonna go use the bathroom before it closes. - Okay. - I'll be back. (ominous instrumental music) - [Tapeworm] I'm losing my patience. - I'm not listening to you. - [Tapeworm] You can't ignore me. - I can't do this anymore. I can't anymore. I can't do it anymore. - [Tapeworm] Do not resist me. You will give me control. - I'm not resisting. - [Tapeworm] Then feed me. - I can't. I can't. I can't. Leave me alone! (ominous instrumental music) (knocks) - Anna, are you in there? (door unlocks) Anna? Anna? (screams) Anna. Anna. What are you doing? Anna. - [Tapeworm] Don't you dare hesitate. - Anna. Anna! Stop it, Anna! Anna! (screaming in pain) (munching) (knock on door) - Hey, are you okay in there? (knocks) Oh shit! (ominous instrumental music) - [Tapeworm] Now was that so hard? (ominous instrumental music) (mellow instrumental music) She's there for the taking. (mellow instrumental music) (crying) (grunting) (cries) Relax. Just set it free. (grunting) (cries) (grunts in pain) (cries) - Anna. Ann... Anna. Anna. (crying) - [Anna] What do you want? - I don't understand. Are you okay? - What do you want? - Anna. What is that? - Get away from me! - Anna-- - Get away from me! (crying) - I'm calling the-- - No! No, no! (crash) (crying) (choking) (crying) - [Tapeworm] Whitney! Where are you baby? - Yoo-hoo! - [Tapeworm] Whitney! (Whitney crying) - No! (Thump) (Thump) (Whitney struggling) (munching) (breathes heavily) - Whitney? Whitney? Baby? Baby? Wake up! Wake up. So sorry. Whitney! Whitney. Baby please, wake up. (crying) What have you done to me? Baby. Baby! I'm so sorry, babe. (mellow instrumental music) (ominous instrumental music) (vomits) (crying) Whitney. - [Tapeworm] What are you doing? No! No! No! What are you doing? No! No! Stop! Stop! (crying, struggling) - I can't control it! (tapeworm whimpers) (cries in pain) (tapeworm whimpers) (static buzz) (ominous out of tune accordion music) (gagging) - Well, the good news is you do not have tapeworms. These routine inspections are important for your health. Did you like the movie? I thought it was fantastic. Would you like something to drink? Water? - I don't want anything from you. - How about a gin and tonic with extra lime? - Please let me go. - You didn't like the film? - What? No. How the fuck could I? She died and, you, you enjoyed it. - Me? No. Well, I did enjoy it. Anna was lazy and conceited. That's what killed her, not me. - Conceited? She just wanted to look good for her wedding. That's not conceit. She wasn't a bad person. - See, that's where you're mistaken. You think only bad people should be punished. The good do not get a pass. No one does. Are things getting any clearer why you're here, Michael? Does Anna's story make sense? I don't know why I'm here. Why are you doing this to me? I have done nothing wrong. - Now that is a better question. What you consider to be reality is nothing more than a mound of clay. Malleable, temporary. (Dr. Saville transforming) I can push and pull and twist and manipulate. I have the power to stop time, to make you suffer. I'm everywhere, and I'm nowhere. I live in the shadows, and hide in plain sight. People are afraid of what lives in the darkness. (Dr. Saville transforming) - (Evil Dr. Saville) I am the darkness, - Let me go, you sick fuck. - (Dr. Saville) Ooh, Michael, finally has a little fight in him. You're feisty, I like it. Boop. It makes this whole experience that much more exciting. But, you are angry at the wrong person. - Let me out of this chair, and I'll show you exactly how fucking angry I am. - (Evil Dr. Saville) Oh, relax, cupcake, you're whining like a teething baby. In my day, we used to have a remedy for that. Have you heard of gum lancing? It hurts. A lot. (Michael screams in pain) - Oh no! Stop it! (Michael screams in pain) - I think you need another story. (film whirring) (melodious instrumental music) (knock on door) - [Amy] Jake, come out right now. - [Cara] Hi. - [Amy] Cara, what are you doing here? - [Cara] Where is he? - [Amy] Oh, oh right. Bathroom. - [Woman] He's supposed to come tonight. Tell him I need to talk to him right now. - [Amy] Now? Okay, yeah, I will tell him. All right. Good to see you. (knock on door) She's gone. You can come get your balls now. - Was she upset? - You could say that. You know, you can't keep hiding in the bathroom every time that you break up with someone. - I'm not hiding in the bathroom, Amy. - You've been in here 45 minutes. - You know, you more than anybody knows I don't like the whole goodbye part. I always... You know I always feel so bad. You know... - Well, maybe if you give them a chance past a first date. (melodious instrumental music) - Oh, here he comes. - Hey, guys. - So, what was wrong with this one? - Seriously, Amy? Okay. She chew her food with her mouth open. - Seriously? That's why you dumped her? - Oh, sorry, Bree, I'm with Jake on this one. But that is a deal breaker-- - Thank you. - You guys are so shallow. It's not a good reason for you to break up with someone. - I am not shallow. I'm, I'm picky. - Let me tell you something. At some point you're gonna realize that the perfect person isn't always out there. I mean you're, not perfect yourself. - Wow. Ouch. - Preach. - Thank you. - Okay, what's wrong with me? - Let me think. You hide in bathrooms to avoid confrontation whenever you break up with women. That's a good place to start. - That's a good point. - Mm. - No. There was something off about her. You don't understand. You don't understand. - Shit. - Okay, okay. - Oh shit. Shit, shit. Shit. (clears throat) Oh, hey, Cara. What's this? - The perfect companion for you, 'cause apparently I'm not. Goodbye, Jake. - Mm. - What is that? - Aqua Pets? - [Tony] Aqua Pets? - Grow your own aquatic buddy. - Hm. - So she got you brine shrimp as a break-up gift? - [Jake] I told you guys, she was weird. (ominous instrumental music) (crumples) (spits) - [Man On TV] You're gonna carry that child a mile through that army of things out there? - [Man On TV 2] I can carry the kid. What's wrong with her? How did she get hurt? - [Woman On TV] One of those things grabbed her. - [Man On TV] Bit her on the arm. - [Woman On TV] What's wrong? - [Man On TV] Who knows what kind of disease those things carry. Is she conscious? - [Woman On TV] Barely. - [Man On TV] She can't walk, she's too weak. (mellow instrumental music) (ominous instrumental music) (light breathing) - Are you okay? - Are you my daddy? - What? No. - Who are you? - I'm Jake. - Jake. - Where did you come from? - You're an Aqua Pet? Seriously? - Yeah. I evolved. - Yeah. Yeah. Where um... Where's your home? - It's here with you. If you want me. - Oh. Yeah, of course. Um... Do you have a name? No? I think I'll call you Mary. (melodious instrumental music) This is for you. - [Mary] For me? What is it? - You have to open it. - To put on? - [Jake] Put on. - How um... - No. It goes like this. (melodious instrumental music) Mm. Yeah. (melodious instrumental music) - Mm. (melodious instrumental music) (ominous instrumental music) (slicing) - I'm home, baby. - [Mary] I'm in the kitchen, my love. - I thought about you all day. I shouldn't have even went to work. - [Mary] I made us dinner. - [Jake] Yeah. I uh, see that. - I wasn't sure what you liked, so I made us everything. I hope you're hungry. (crunching) - That's a lot of food. - I'm sorry, Jake. I was just trying to help. I can throw it all away if you're disappointed. - No, no. I didn't mean it like that. Whatever we don't eat, we can save for later. Everything looks amazing. You did so good. (chopping) (melodious instrumental music) - Um, wait. - What's this? - It's a present. From our two-day anniversary. This is from our first date. - You pulled this out of the trash. - You don't like it, do you? - No. I love it. - Promise. - I promise. I'll keep it forever. - Are you okay? - Yeah. I actually have something for you too. - Oh. - Mary? These past few days have been the most amazing days of my life. And I just wanted to know if you'd be my wife? - Jake! Jake! - Is that a yes? - Yes. - Put it on. It's perfect. (giggles) - I wish it could be like this forever. - I know. - What was that? - What? - That woman? You were checking her out. - Mary, I wasn't checking out. - Oh, you like that, do you? - What? - Do you wanna fuck her? I bet you wanna fuck her. Is that what you want to do? - Mary, I was just looking at her belly. - Just looking? Well, look at this. - What are doing? - Hey, bitch! - Mary! - Hey, bitch. Try and steal my man, will you? (stabbing) (woman screaming) (ominous instrumental music) Is everything okay, sweetie? How do you like her now? Is she still fuckable? Keys? Don't make me ask twice! Where are your manners, Jake? Open the fucking door for me! Excuse me. - Mary, you-you said open the door for you. - Do I look like a fucking passenger to you? (car door closes) Get in the fucking car, Jake. - Do you even know how to drive, Mary? (ominous instrumental music) - Yes. (car engine starts) (crash) (man groans) - Oh my God, you just hit that guy. - Shut your fucking mouth. - Please let me out, Mary. - So not done with you, mister. (car screeches) - [Bree] That's them, them them. Quiet, quiet, quiet. What the fuck is that sound? - [All] Surprise! (party horn blows) - Wait, what are you guys doing here? - Uh... Well it's um--- - Whoa, whoa, whoa. Why are there women I don't know in our apartment, Jake? - It's my... It's my birthday. - [Mary] And you were going to tell me this when? - Mary, I completely forgot. I'm sorry. - Because I forgot your birthday. You let your friends come into my house and make me feel bad. - I didn't mean... (speaking indistinctly) - Which one of you has a key to my house? - I have an extra popper if you'd like it? - I guess I'll have to kill you first. (screaming) Who's next? (screams in pain) You're not getting out of here. (bottle breaks) (growls) (frightened screams) Put the bottle down, Jim. - How do you know my name? (bottle breaks) - I like you. You're fun. (snarls) - [Bree] Oh my god, oh my God, no! No! (heavy breathing) (loud bang) - [Customer Service] Thank you for calling Aqua Pets, how can I help you? - My-My-My Aqua Pets turned into a woman, she's trying to kill me. - [Customer Service] I see. I'm sorry to hear that happened, sir. Did you follow the directions on the box? - What directions? She turned into a human. - [Customer Service] I can understand your concerns. Our products are subject to the highest quality control. Did you use distilled water? (stabs door) - What does water have to do with anything? - [Customer Service] If you use tap water, it invalidates your warranty. - What are you talking about warranty? Your Aqua Pet turned into a human, sh-she's trying to kill me. She-She killed all my friends at my birthday party. (stabs door) - [Customer Service] I'm sorry she ruined your party. Are you dissatisfied with your perfect companion? - Yes, I'm dissatisfied, she's trying to kill me. - [Customer Service] Would you like to return your Aqua Pet? (stabs door) - [Mary] Open this fucking door, Jake! I'm going to kill you! - Y-Y-Yeah, yeah, please. Yes. Yes. - [Customer Service] Do you have the original box? - She-She's not gonna fit in the original box. Sh-She's a woman. - [Customer Service] Do you have an email where we can send you a prepaid return label? - [Mary] If you don't open this fucking door-- - How am I suppose to get her in a box, sh-she's a life-sized person, she's trying to kill me, how am I gonna get her in a box? (stabs door) - [Customer Service] You could poke holes in it. - You got to be fucking kidding me? - [Mary] Please. Open the door, baby. I'm sorry. - [Customer Service] Have you tried spraying her with vinegar? (stabs door) - Why would I try spraying her with vinegar? - [Customer Service] Aqua Pets don't like vinegar. They shrivel up. It will invalidate your warranty though. (stabs door) - [Mary] Open this fucking door! - [Customer Service] Sir? Hello? - [Mary] You know I love you. (heavy breathing) - [Customer Service] Sir? (heavy breathing) (door breaks) (Mary snarls) - So, what am I going to do with you, you naughty, naughty little boy? (screams) (screams in pain) (high-pitched snarl) (Mary laughs) So which part should I eat next, huh? Would you like to choose? - Fuck you! - Oh! That's spousal abuse! - You're not my spouse. - Well, I believe this ring says otherwise. Don't you love me anymore, Jake? - I could never love a monster like you. - Time to pay up then. (Jake screams in pain) (gnawing) (screams in pain) (Mary breathes heavily) (ominous instrumental music) (film whirring) (metal clanging) - Well that was fun. I wasn't expecting that high of a body count, so that was a nice surprise. (groans in pain) Did you like this one? I can get you an Aqua Pet if you like, they mature really nicely. That Mary is someone you'd consider leaving your wife for, don't you think? No? Redheads not your type? What do you like? Strawberry blonde. Mm. - Look, I don't know what you mean. I don't understand your fucking riddles. I just want to go home. - Oh, come on, Michael. It's just the two of us, you can be honest with me. Think hard. Why are you here? I'm not the villain. You are not here because of me. I want to be quite clear about that. I don't take people who don't ask for it. I heard your pleas. You told me what you wanted, and I'm just helping it come true. You could be a little more grateful. - Grateful? Fuck you. (Dr. Saville transforming) - Sure, I'm game. I'd let you fuck me. I promise I won't tell your wife. - You don't talk about my wife. - See, Jake wanted someone perfect, so I gave him his wish. But, sometimes wishes have repercussions. I'll make yours come true if you let me. - You're a fucking psycho! - No! - (Evil Dr. Saville) Watch the fucking movie! (film whirring) (heavy breathing) (cocks gun) (gun fires) (heavy breathing) - Dad? - It's okay, sweetie. I'll be right back. Don't come out of the closet, no matter what you hear. Promise me. - Promise. - I'll come back for you when it's safe. - Where's Nick? Is he okay? - Nick's sick. - Did they bite him? - He's infected. - Did you... - Oh, baby... You have to understand that thing out there was not your brother. I couldn't save him. I couldn't save... He was gonna hurt you, and I won't let anyone hurt you. - Promise? - Until my last breath. You'll be safe here. - I wish mom was here. - I do too. - Did you called her? - Every 10 minutes. And as soon as she answers, you could speak to her. But for now, I need you to stay here. (zombie grumbling) (crying) (zombie snarling) - I'm so sorry, Nick. I tried. But I couldn't... I... (screams) (cries) (heavy breathing) I'm sorry, Nick. I'm sorry. (heavy breathing) Green beans. Already ate the fucking beans. Mushrooms and three fruits. (sighs) That's not even enough for this week. We have... We have... We have two more cans. We have two more cans. We have two... We have these six. Six beans. How am I gonna feed her on this? How am I gonna feed her on this shit? It's all right. I've got to call her. Come on. Please pick up. Please pick up, Sarah. Please, I know you're safe. I can't do this. I can't, I can't feed her. I can't feed her. Fuck. Fuck, fuck. (zombie snarling) Oh. (heavy breathing) (ominous instrumental music) (screaming) (dog barks) (heavy breathing) (ominous instrumental music) (melodious instrumental music) (zombie snarling) (ominous instrumental music) Okay. I got you. (inhales/exhales rapidly) (screaming) No, no! (struggling) Oh no! (screaming) (thud) (zombie snarling) Come here! (gun fires) Fuck! (heavy breathing) I got you too. I got you too. (mellow instrumental music) Okay. Oh yeah. Okay. Okay. (hammering) (mellow instrumental music) Hey, it's okay. It's just me. - Dad. What's going on? - Are you okay? - I heard your gun again. Was it more monsters? Are they going to get in? - No. Absolutely not. I promise. You're safe here. - Mm-hmm. I hope mommy's okay. - Oh me too, baby. Me too. Me too. Me too. (mellow instrumental music) (birds chirping) (mellow instrumental music) (tapping) - Rise and shine, kiddo. - Dad. What time is it? - Time your sleepy butt woke up. I made us breakfast. - What is it? - Cereal. - Did you find milk? - No, it's, it's dry. - Not again. Dry cereal, is just so boring. - Well, would you like me to go the store? - Really, Dad? - Seriously! I can, I can grab us some milk, jump over a few zombies and be back in five minutes. Hey, I tell you what, when all this blows over I'll be first in line to get us milk. Deal? - Deal. - I do have a surprise for you though. So close your eyes and hold out your hands. Okay. No peeking. Ah, close your eyes. (Drew giggles) Okay, okay, you go. Okay, no peeking. Hold up those hands. Ta-da! (squeal of excitement) - Thank you, daddy! Where did you find it? - It must have fallen to the back of the shelf. It was, it was behind the soup. I have an idea. You can pour it on your cereal. - Ew, that's gross. - I bet you that dry cereal doesn't sound so bad now, huh? What? Hey! What? Not my, my rainbow. What are you... Give me that. I want my rainbow back. - No. I ate it. - Uh-uh. - No! (laughter) (taps cards) - Do you have any fives? - Nope. - Oh come on! You don't have any fives at all? - Mm. - Are you cheating? - No! - Show me your cards. - I'm not cheating! - Come on. You cheater! And to think I gave you the last cookie. - It was an awesome cookie. - Oh, so not only do you cheat, you gloat? - Yep! And kids are supposed to win anyway. - You're just like your mommy. Hey, I'm sure she's okay. - Yeah. Can I sleep in your room tonight? - Of course you can, sweetheart. (crickets chirping) (low banging) (gasps) (dog barks) (dog barks loudly) (zombies snarling) (dog barks loudly) Shh, shh, shh, shh. (dog barks loudly) Shh. (dog barks loudly) Shh! Shh. (hushing) (dog barks loudly) Calm down. Calm down. - Daddy? - Go to your room and hide. - Daddy? - Run! (dog barks loudly) Shh! Please calm, please calm, please calm. (dog barks loudly) (screams) (dog whimpers) (zombies snarling) (cries) (ominous instrumental music) - [Emma] I'm hungry. - Again? Weren't you hungry yesterday? I-I specifically remember giving you food. - I'm supposed to eat every day, silly. - Really? Are you sure? - Well, as luck would have it, 'Kitchen del Daddy' is opened for business. Take a seat, ma'am, and I'll bring you a menu. (clicks pen) May I recommend the cereal. It's a house specialty. - Yes, please. - It would have marshmallows in it, but I'm afraid a previous guest got to them and they're all gone. - That was me, Daddy. - Well, then I'm gonna have to ask you to leave. We can't allow that kind of behavior in this fine establishment. - Mine. - How did you sleep? - I dreamed of mom. - Me too. - Really? - Of course. I always do. I wish she was here. - Those things keep me awake. - Hey, they won't get in. Promise. - I know. They just scare me. - They scare me too. (phone rings) Hello? - [Sarah] Hello. - Sarah? Where are you? - Sweetheart, can you hear me? Hey-- - Sarah, sweetheart, I can't hear you. Are you okay? - What's wrong? - There's too much static. - I'm fine. - I can't hear her. - Nick... Nick is... Nick's there, right? - Sarah? Sarah. Sweetheart, if you can hear me, Emma's safe, she's with me, but, but something's happened to Nick. - [Sarah] I love you so much-- - [Drew] He was bitten. - I'm gonna be there. Okay you're doing great. Hug and kiss me-- - I-I had to... So please call me back. Please. Please. - Babe? - Sarah? Sarah? (phone hangs) - Was that mom? - I'm certain of it. She's gonna call us back. She'll call us back. She'll call us back. She's gonna call us back. She's gonna... (ominous instrumental music) (slow footsteps) (loud bang) (zombie snarling) (gun fires) (groans) - Shots fired at Miller residence. (ominous instrumental music) - Go back to your room, sweetie. - [Emma] I don't feel well. - No... Oh, sweetie, you're running a fever. We need to get you to bed. Great timing, kiddo. - I'm sorry. - No, you have nothing to be sorry for. You just need some rest. - [Anna] Hold your position. Backup is en route. ETA nine minutes. - What do we have on this guy? - No warrants, no previous incarcerations. However, I do see a restraint recommendation from a Dr. Saville. - [Police Officer] From who? - Shrink. (groans) - How old is this? - [Anna] Three weeks. - Three weeks? - Wh-Why the hell haven't we acted on this? - I guess the doctor didn't see him as a threat, that's why he didn't pushed it any further. - Not a threat my ass. So what's this guy's story? - Saville has him listed as chronic paranoid delusions, schizophrenic, PTSD and insomnia. - That looks like he's trying to keep something out. You said PTSD. Is this guy military? - No. His wife was murdered two months ago while she walked in the park. God, she was eight months pregnant. - Oh Christ. - Are you seeing any movement? - [Police Officer] Ah. That's a negative. - [Anna] Anyone else inside? (cringes in pain) - I couldn't tell. He shot as soon as, as soon as I knocked on the door. (crying) - Where are you? Where are you? Home... Please come home. Please... Please come home. You should come home. (mild tapping) (heavy breathing) (Emma screams) (crying) - Oh, baby girl, no. No, no, no. I'm so sorry. No, no, no. No. Not my girl, please. Not my girl. Not my girl. Not my girl. You're not my... You're not my girl. You're not my girl. You're not my girl. You're not my girl. You're not my girl. (crying) (screams) (gun fires) (ominous accordion music) (crying) I'm so sorry. I'm sorry-- - Drew? What have you done? - Sarah, you're okay? - What have you done? - I, she... She turned. I-I, I couldn't save her-- - [Sarah] What have you done? - I couldn't save any of them. - You killed them. - I couldn't save any of them. I couldn't, (indistinct). - [Sarah] Put the gun down. (crying) - It's my fault. It's my fault. It's my fault. It's my fault. - [Sarah] Put the gun down. - I'm sorry. - (Cop) Put the gun down. Put the gun down. Put the fucking gun down! (screams) (gun fires) (gasps) (gasps) (screams) (gasps) (gasps) - I'm sorry! I'm so sorry! I'm so... (screams) (crying) - I don't feel well. (screams) (gun fires) (gasps) (mellow instrumental music) (film whirring) (Dr. Saville humming) (groans) - Poor Drew. Did you see how he lost it? I didn't see that one coming at all, did you? Oh. Oh, you're not my girl, you're not my girl. - (Evil Dr. Saville) Bang! - He shot the fucking kid right between the fucking eyes. His kid. Drew did that. Pay attention to that little detail. He did it, not me. - He was a good man. - (Dr. Saville) And yet he killed both of his children. Even the greatest man is one bad action away from pure evil. - How can you enjoy this? - How can you not? I'm showing you the way out, but you do not wanna listen. Instead of appreciating what he still had, Drew spent so much time focusing on what he'd lost. He wished his wife would come back. All at the expense of his present. And that... And that ultimately cost him everything. Is this story getting any clearer for you, Michael? Do you understand what I'm trying to show you? - You killed him. - (Evil Dr. Saville) No, I didn't do anything. I just flicked the first domino and watched the whole damn train collapse. - (Dr. Saville) Remember I said wishes have repercussions? I don't just mean Anna, or Jake, or Drew. Or even you. I mean everyone around you. Friends, family, strangers, everyone. - You're sick. - (Evil Dr. Saville) No! No, you're wrong. I'm the cure. All of this. I fixed them. Every last fucking one of them. - You're not a god. - Oh, I know. I am something so much greater. - (Dr. Saville) You know.. I still don't think we're quite there yet. I want to show you something a little personal. Something you can relate to. (film whirs) (ominous accordion music) Watch the film. - I just want to go back. - You never left. You're still down there having a drink with a woman you just met, contemplating cheating on your wife. - I wasn't thinking about cheating. I wasn't. Don't lie to me, Michael. I heard you. What did you say when she walked away? - I don't know. - [Evil Dr. Saville] What did you say? - I don't know! - (Dr. Saville) Fine. We have to do this the hard way. - No, I don't know! I don't know! - [Dr. Saville] We can start at your feet and work up from there. - No, I don't know! Ah, I don't know! - [Evil Dr. Saville] Tell me! - I don't know! - Tell me now! - I don't know! I wished I could leave with her. (exhales) - (Dr. Saville) Was that so hard? You wished you could leave with her. That's why you're here. You made a wish, Michael. And I am bound to helping it come true. - Well I... I didn't, I didn't say it out loud. - Oh no, you don't have to say it out loud, I hear everything. Wishes are your deepest desires. - No, it was just a wish. I didn't mean it. - (Evil Dr. Saville) No! It's not just a wish. A wish is selfishness in its purest form. Look at the very structure of it. I wish. I. Not we, not you. I. Uttered without a shred of concern for anyone else. - (Dr. Saville) And you know what the best part is? No one learns. They never do. Long after you're worm food, I'll still be here doing this and loving every fucking second of it. Everybody wants something. That's what makes my job so easy. - What else are you gonna do to me? - Oh, I've already done it. I started the moment I brought you here. - I want to go back. I'm so sorry, I didn't know. I want to do it again. No, please, let me go. I just want my family back. (Dr. Saville transforms) - And yet you're dreaming about going back to my house and fucking me. When I return from the bathroom, you are going to stand up from your seat, and follow me right out of the airport lounge like a good little puppy, and flush 20 years of marriage down the toilet. Be careful what you wish for. (groans) (crying) - No. - I'll see you soon, Michael. - No! No, no! No! No! No! No!
