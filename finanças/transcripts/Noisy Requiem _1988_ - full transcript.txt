I dedicate this film to Mr. Hikaru Yamagiwa, who died before the film's completion. And to all the lost souls: "Rest in peace". Director Yoshihiko Matsui Produced by YOKUBO Production "The Noisy Requiem" 4-13... Where is 4-13? 4-13... 4... - I had a strange dream last night. - What about? Hmmm, this boy was scattering beans... Huh... say, do you think the blind can see in their dreams? Nah, no way. Then a pure white dove came flying over to the boy's beans. But there were other grayish pigeons... so the white one couldn't get to the beans. The gray ones were bullies? Right. And then the white one turned black. - Like a crow? - Yes. It turned into a crow. That's stupid! And there were lots of dead bodies. - Lots of what? - Dead bodies... Starved to death. Like in that song "We are the world". What are you talking about? The people walking around would fall down, one after another. Then the dove that turned into a crow comes flying over, and it starts pecking at a man on the ground, and eats the poor man, who must be dead, because the man doesn't move at all. That's really gross! You saw all that? Well, it was a dream. I get it... that's why you give them money, and tell them not to get eaten by the crows! I don't know. I hate crows! What's so good about eating dead people? I'd rather be a rail thin white dove. Let's go? Going to lunch? No. We're giving them money. Sorry. I don't think so. Alright. Then hold this. Thanks. Hey! - How much did you give them? - 1000 yen. - No way! - It's true. What a waste! You said you'd rather be the white dove, but anyone would turn into a crow, if they're starved. Maybe. But I'd still want to be a dove. But then you'd die. But white is prettier. You think white is pretty? At least give him 100 yen. Why? I won't have any money left to eat on the way home. See: you're turning into a crow too. You can afford to give 1000 yen, because you're rich. I feel so bad. I feel so sorry... I really do. The Pacific War? Poor thing. Or could it actually have been the Korean War? Eh? The Pacific War... I fought in the Pacific War for the Empire of Japan. In Manchuria. - For real? - Yes. For real. Poor guys. I feel so sorry. You know, you two... you blame the Pacific War for your misery. But I bet you're not even Japanese. You're just wearing those caps and pretending to be Japanese. You're Korean, aren't you? You never went to war either. You got hit by an American bomb. Isn't that the truth? Eh? Am I right? You had nothing to do in Korea, so you came here... to pretend being Japanese, and to do this as a job, right? Hey, look. Look carefully. I've been carrying this since the day I went to the front. And this injury was caused... when I got caught by the Russians in Manchuria. We are not Koreans! Hello? Sergeant? Oh, sergeant! Sergeant? Oh, sergeant! So, you're healthy? Yeah. You're not sick or anything? - No. - No venereal diseases? None. - You're hired then. - Okay. - This is good business. - Yeah? Work hard. Always be on time, just like any other job. Let's get to the site then. I have tea ready here. Excuse me. No need for tea; we're going to the site now. This is my sister, Natsuko. Are you grossed out, by how Natsuko and I look? Not at all. Two men left in the middle of an interview, after seeing us. But it wasn't so bad today - those two men were just shocked by us. They tried hard to hide their shock, so they kept asking about the job - like they care. We do pay better than anyone else... They both said they wanted the job real bad. I'm serious. They were complaining about their current jobs. They were both talkative, but after I introduced Natsuko, they became quiet. Their eyes went downcast and they stopped talking. When I asked questions, they were too stunned to speak. Finally, they said they had other appointments. I looked at their faces as they fled out. Their expressions said, 'what is this, a freak show?' Aren't you embarrassed to walk with me? No. I'm not. I hope you'll stick around. - Okay. - That's good. So, what kind of jobs have you done before? He must be crazy... Is she your sister? Take it before you forget. It's almost your birthday. - It's okay. - Come on, take it. I said it's okay. Just take it. Mom left this for you. No, thanks. Are you listening to me? Mom will scold me when I meet her in heaven. So please keep it, okay? I - SHI - KA - WA Hello there. Can I help you? Oh, you want this? It's not exactly the same, but this looks close. And it's on sale. You don't like it? Thanks anyway. Come again! What a prick, that customer. Go to a fancy department store, if you don't like my stuff. - Excuse me? - Arrogant prick! Excuse me? Summer. Under the flaming sun. I could use some rain. A good downpour. It was hot as hell today. Steam was rising from the street as I walked along. Rotten people were walking the streets like jellyfish. I hate how they jump into my eyes. Rotten people would be sitting here and there, or standing or running around. Some were even laughing. Laughing hard. Whatever it was that was so funny. They're all garbage. Dumb, stupid garbage. I went to see her again today. I like her just as much as I liked you. I'm sorry, but I hope you'll forgive me. Honey, she's gone. She's gone, just like you. I'm all alone again, honey. It's just you and me again. I'm so sorry, honey. President Pak, shot to death Hey, you little... uh, excuse me. It's 130 yen. I need 60 yen more. But I always pay 70 yen. You're lying. It says 70 yen on the bus. It says so right here, too. Small people - 70 yen Good morning. Are you nuts? That means children, not short adults! The others were being nice to you. Come on, give me the 60 yen. Would you please move it? Are you alright, Miss? Ah, excuse me - don't you want the change? Just keep it. Are you okay? You want me to keep the change? Oh, look at your clothes. - Excuse me? - Just keep it. - Thank you very much. - You're welcome. The little nut! Her brain must be tiny, too. There's a spare seat. I'd rather be standing here. But thanks. How would you like to buy this? You seem to be interested. - Where are you going today? - Same as yesterday. I brought you some iced tea. Oh, thank you. Would you not tell my brother about the thing on the bus? - Please? - Okay. You know, Ishikawa's a hard worker. I'm thinking of giving him a raise. He even came early today and he does get the job done. - What do you think? - That's up to you, but his salary is set and I don't think you need to raise it. Although I know he's a nice man, but this is about money. Alright? Let's go to Namba. Come on. Good... Good... Good evening. Good evening. Men are all so horny. Oh, this? When I was in school, we went to a factory on a field trip. A friend of mine tripped on the stairs, and I got splashed with some real hot oil. That's how I got this black ugly thing. But that guy back then licked my scar. It made me happy. Stop! Just stop it! Stop touching me, creature! Please don't touch me. I'm sorry. I love you. I have a woman. And there's... there's a baby inside her. She's pregnant. Adult Goods Shop I want this. Good... Good... Good... evening to... you. Good... Good... I've always wanted to do it with someone like her. Are you sure you don't mind? You sure? You're so much better than that little girl from kindergarten. Tight body, but she looks mature enough. So, do you like this? Oh, this is good... So good. Hey, I'm going to explode in my pants! Let me go next, okay? No way! I'm the one who found this midget. I'm the one who got her to come over. So I'm next. Hey, aren't you finished yet? I'm coming! Oh, gross! Hold on a second. You stink! Get the hell out! What are you guys?! Here, eat this. Hey! Forget the money. Just get out of here. Come on. Get out of here. You have to go now. I said get out! What are you saying? Come on, get out. Move it. We win. I don't care. Just get the hell out. Don't touch me! You're gross. We win. Come on, move it. Get out of here now! Go! Go! We win. Stop it, idiot! Hurry up! Get your asses out of here now! Yeah, whatever. You're the winner, so just get out! Hey, parakeet, you're small amongst the birds. Where's Ishikawa? Hasn't he even called? Stop shouting! She's angry. Happy birthday! What's happy about becoming 32 years old? Excuse me? Would you like a bible? What do you want? You see, I'm a bible salesman... - Go away. - Say what? - Christ... - Christ? Why? Do you pity us because we're midgets? - Just go away! - Ugh! As if the book will make us bigger! Full of shit! Besides, I don't want life after death. Go away, never come back! You idiot! Good day to... you. Good day to... you. Good day to you. Good day to... you. Good day to... you. Good day to... you. Good day to you. Good day to... you. Good day to... you. Here's mom's will. See? It's your birthday. Happy birthday. Mom told me to make love to you once a year. Shut up and do it! Mom felt sorry for you, growing old not knowing what it's like. I said, shut up. 11, 12... 13, 14.... 15, 16... 17, 18, 19... 20 years old, 21, 22, 23... 24, 25, 26... 27, 28, 29... 30, 31... Not worth it... Look at them all. They are so low. I'd rather chop it off than have sex with these women. They really are so cheap. If it's a girl... I'll name her "Harumi", after a sunny ocean. 'Inside the house... 'was a wolf with a big belly. 'It was sleeping on the bed. "Oh no," '"The wolf must have eaten grandmother." 'The hunter then took out a pair of scissors, 'and he started to cut open the wolf's belly. 'Out came the little red riding hood, 'saying she was so very scared. 'Next... 'the grandmother popped out. 'The two of them... 'packed little rocks in the wolf's belly, 'then they sewed up the belly. 'And finally they sank the wolf in the river.' Little Red Riding Hood Good day to you. Hello. Can you wait a while longer? I know, I know. But I told you. I told you a while ago. You were supposed to pay back a while ago. But can't you wait three days? I've waited long enough already. But I don't have the money. You'd better pay me back; I won't let you off. Excuse me? Give me back my money. Hello? Excuse me? Hey! I'm taking this. Hold on. Sorry about that. Will you hurry up? Hey, are you listening? Writhe and struggle... Flounder around... Strain yourself... Here, God. A cremation for you. This should make you warm during the winter this year. Good for you, God. Thank you.
