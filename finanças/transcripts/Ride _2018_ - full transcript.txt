Will you wear all black tomorrow? Why black? People usually wear black to funerals. It depends. On what? On what you want to wear, it doesn't have to be black. What do you want to wear? Dunno... haven't thought about it yet. When will you, it's tomorrow? Today, I have all day. There'll be loads of people there, right? If TV cameras are there, loads of people will be there. The TV will be there, right? Yes. Hold my hand. We'll be together tomorrow, okay? Everything will be okay. You don't need to be afraid. I'm not afraid. Good. LAUGHING - What will you wear tomorrow? - Black. You've got loads of black clothes... a whole wardrobe full! I'll borrow Ciccio's Borussia tracksuit. - What tracksuit? - Borussia. - What's Borussia? - A German football team. - Why German? - 'Cause it's cool. What this tracksuit like? It's got yellow stripes... but it's mostly black. Are the stripes bright yellow or dark yellow? What kind of yellow? It's mostly black. A Borussia tracksuit. You said I could wear what I want. Of course, honey, a tracksuit's fine. A tracksuit's cool. And these are clams. - A kilo of sea! - Great! If you need anything, call me or my mum, she's at home. - You know who's coming tomorrow? - No. Alfredo, remember him? He's coming from Germany tomorrow. When he heard about the factory workers' procession, he said. "I've got to be there." Okay, I'll be back for him round 8.00. - Bye, Cesare. - Bye, Aldo. Dad, you've got your backpack! Cesare, that thing's inside, he might forget. There's no wind anyway... But you decide. Bye, dad. Why does he shout? 'Cause he thinks strokes happen in your ear. Let's go. Testing, testing... Okay. Many people are here to say goodbye to Mauro Secondari. Nettuno has never seen such a big funeral, Mauro's son's schoolmates are also here, a huge crowd of them. Now back to you, I'll return when the coffin makes its final exit. Excuse me. - Excuse me! - What is it? I'm working! Good morning. Good morning, what is it? I'm here for Bruno, the dead man's son. Poor kid, what is it? Right now Bruno's attending the funeral, but he wants to book an interview. This isn't a restaurant! Sorry, Bruno. He wants to do an interview. - An interview, kid? - Yes, sir. For kids who are going through the same things, he wants to witness... "To bear witness"... look. Look, it says. "He wants to bear witness..." - Not "to witness". - He wants to bear witness. What a drag. That's a kind thought, but you know that kids can't give interviews? Just mention his name and don't make his voice "metally". "Metallic", it's not a band! - My God, really... - Sorry, metallic. - Okay, go on. - It's your turn. Sorry. You know we need his parents' permission? He just wants to surprise his mum, she's not very well. I'm sorry, but without their permission it'd be illegal. How's my dear little lad? Bruno's fine. - He must be upset, poor kid. - Who is it? I'll put Athos on, he's here. Yes, okay. Bye, Pina! - What is it? - It's Carolina, her husband died. Hi, Athos, it's Carolina. - Wait, hold the phone properly. - Who is it? Don't drop it. Athos, can you hear me? My dear girl -' Hi, how are you? My little spring blossom, we heard the terrible news. We old folks should die, not the young and not while at work It's not fair, we old folks should die. Okay, say goodbye now, she has loads to do. You die in war, not at work. Sorry, darling, he's stopped taking his medication. Why do you keep insisting? At least his medication keeps him calm. If he stops taking it, he'll run away. Then we'll be on Reported Missing -' Mum... - I'll call you back. - Okay, I'll tell you when I'll arrive Yes, okay... bye. - Good morning. - The buzzer's not working. - I know, there's a problem with... - Hello. I'm Sonia. - Hello. - Mauro must've told you about us. Yes, hi, how are you? Awful. But you must feel worse. - May I come in? - Of course. You don't know who I am. So Mauro never told you about me? Okay... It was so long ago. Going on how sad I am, you wouldn't know but it's the truth. Mauro was my first love. And I was his. We were together all through high school. No! Really? What a pleasure! My goodness! Why are you whacking them? You have to treat clams with kindness. They're alive and these are their last moments before dying. Caress them. You're not the one cooking... Damn, it's lovely outside. Where are the forks? Doing physical therapy or coming to eat? Come on. The flame is too high. What did Canestelli say? When will she go out with you? When you do the interview or once it's on TV? I don't remember... - I don't know. - It's important, what did she say? That she'll fall in love with me once I've been on TV. - So she doesn't love you now? - No, how can she? I get it, she's waiting for the interview to be on TV. Yes, I think so, but now let's do it without reading. Wait. What are you waiting for? Are you peeking at the lines? No. Come on then. Many people have come to say goodbye to Mauro Secondari. Nettuno's never seen such a big funeral. I don't want to bother you, I came for the funeral. I moved to Genoa years ago... but I couldn't not be here... I wanted to meet you. You're very beautiful. Thank you. I thought that... if you haven't chosen one yet, this might be good. For the gravestone, I mean. The gravestone, right. I hadn't thought about it yet. But you're in this too, I don't know... You can cut me out and then enlarge it. Of course. When I saw the news, I thought it might not be him but someone with the same name. But then they mentioned the factory, and all the rest... My heart is filled with sorrow. If I hadn't let him go... if we'd still been together, maybe now he would be... here. Come here. I'll hold this, you pour the oil on. Okay, not too much. Great, that's enough. Did you speak to Santino? No. He said he'll go picket, even though I offered to go with Valerio and the kids. - There's no need. - That's what you think! They're all coming. The eastern sector reopened yesterday, normal shifts have resumed, they'll be back at work tomorrow. They should do it for themselves, not for me. Yes, but if they start working, I can't see them making a racket tomorrow. I can. Okay, I'll call Santino later. Actually, you call him. He listens to you. I know who okayed this nonsense of reopening right away. Here we go. The same ones who'll flex their muscles tomorrow, who think it's enough to wave flags at the funeral to bug them like we used to fucking bug them. Then they'll go back to work. It's already salted. If we were still there, like hell they'd reopen. If we were still there, nothing would've happened to Mauro. Does this look black to you? No, but it looks great on you. That's not true. It's too big, it's not black. It's not a Borussia top, look. - What does this say? - Villa Luciana Sporting Club. I can't wear this to my dad's funeral. Sorry, I rowed with that idiot Fabrizio. I don't care about Fabrizio. Now what'll I do? Can I say something? Your trousers are blue, they're smart and they look good. - Just wear a black top. - I don't have one. - Not even a sweatshirt? - No. I'm sorry, Bruno, I'm sorry... that idiot Fabrizio! Wait a minute. It should be in here. What? My anorak. Your anorak? My mum's obsessed with the Kyoto Protocol, says it could rain at any time. - What's the Kyoto Protocol? - Here it is! Come here, put it on. Go on. Cool, it's perfect for the interview. It's really cool. Put the hood on. Stand on that. I'm speechless, Bruno, you look awesome. Hey, is your phone on silent? I tried calling you. Maybe... what's all this stuff? - Hi. - It's eggplant Parmesan. Give her a hand. Wow, that looks great! We'll just eat it from here! It looks so good! Who made it? Come on, guys. There are some tissues there. It's over, Carolina. We wanted to tell you after the funeral, but I don't know what's come over us. Last summer I met someone and fell in love. It was an impossible, complicated love, but it happened... it happened all the same. I found out while on the computer. I was looking for a photo, instead I saw the chat history. I thought I was going to die. Then I cried like mad thinking about how hurt he'd been. I could see from the messages that he'd suffered. - He'd suffered, he'd been hurt. - I'd been hurt. That's when I realised it was over, from how I reacted to those messages. I wasn't crying as a woman, but as a mother. 16 years. That's a long time, Carolina. We lost so many things along the way, too many things. Our love story's over... but Carolina... your love story with Mauro will never end. It'll never be over. - Right? - Yes. That's so cool. You two will never leave each other. You're so beautiful, babe. How many boyfriends has your mum had? Before or after my dad? After, before doesn't count. There's one in the middle. Mario, the guy my mum chose. - He can count as half. - He didn't last long anyway. Mario, and then? After Mario there was Gianni... or Giovanni... I'm not sure. She never called him by his name. Mario counts as half, Gianni as one, then there's Simone, but he was before Gianni. - So that makes two? - Two and a half. Two and a half. Simone is the dad of that idiot with the Borussia tracksuit, Fabrizio. Okay. - What about yours? - My what? Your mother. It's too soon, we'll see. My mum says your mum's young, from Rimini, a foreigner, so... - She'll find someone real quick. - Why? When Guazza moved here, everyone looked at her. - Because she was ugly. - No, because she was foreign. If she was from here, she'd be ugly. Instead, she's interesting. - Do you like Guazza? - No. - You like Guazza. - No. But she's a lot prettier now. - How much do you like her? - A bit. - Why don't you talk to her? - I will, when her braces come off. Let me know when you do, we'll go out together. It's wonky. It's not a painting. - It's wobbly, don't you see? - I know, I'm fixing it. Ain't you got any wire? Use some wire to hold it up. Wait. Give me that. Wind it around the wood. Use the bolt. Why don't you make a double knot? - What's he doing? - Don't touch it! He's messing with it. Hands off! - Are you busy? - No. Good, let's get busy then. Why don't you wear any make-up? For heaven's sake, I don't understand you. I look at you young women, you don't make an effort anymore, it's always tracksuits, short hair... What are you scared of? You need to be beautiful tomorrow, extremely beautiful. You mustn't stop being a woman because your husband's died. - Right. - Good. I know it's not easy, honey. At first I couldn't sleep, I stopped washing... I stopped eating, I stayed cooped up indoors. I was so ashamed... but then you get over it. - And you know when that is? - No. When you realise that you're next. And then, to be honest, it's natural, that's how things are. You know you're top of the list and you don't fear death anymore. When it happens... I'll be ready. There's something else I want to say, Carolina. Don't cry at the funeral. I know you've run out of tears now, I can tell by your swollen eyes. But you mustn't cry there. You have to be the most beautiful and strongest one there, okay? Now I need to wee. - You know where the toilet is, right? - I only wee at my house. If you like it, I can do it again tomorrow. It only takes a minute. Oh, God! My femur! My femur! how typical. Come on, don't worry. Calm down, you'll be all right. Lift your arm, let's belt you up... there. I don't want to die like an old lady. You're not old, you're a young lady with great skin! If I were a bit younger, I'd be courting you. Don't leave me, Carolina, they'll leave me to die on a ward. A ward? More like out in the street! - Ready? On the count of three. - Ready. One... three! Don't scream, you'll be fine, we're just going for a nice walk. - Shall I leave the keys with you? - Yes, thanks. - Is she badly hurt? - No, she just had a fall. They get scared at their age... We'll do an X-ray then see. Can I share something with you? Yes, of course. Me and Mauro used to play football together as kids. In the Under-18 category. He was a right back, I was a left back. There's something I should tell you. Mauro was a great right back. But if he'd been a wing attacker, he'd have been better. - Sorry, I had to tell you. - That's fine. Sorry, one more thing. I found the T-shirt from our '96-'97 season. I thought, if it's not a problem, if you don't mind, of bringing it to the service to put over the coffin... no, he wasn't a pro player. - We can put it beside it... - Yes, bring it. - You're sure it's not a problem? - Yes, thanks. Thanks. My condolences. - What? - My condolences. - Thanks. - You're welcome. The buzzer's not working. The door was open. Burglary is the only crime I've yet to commit. How are you? Your hair's gone Grey! But at least you're not bald. I like your black eye, you look like a panda. Oh, that... Who knows that you're here? No one. Where's Bruno? At his friend's house. He's grown up. Yes. How did you find out? Did you see him? No. Here, you try. Leave that. Come on, it's easy. - He's having fun. - He's quite something. Thanks, Bruno, good luck. Thanks for the opportunity. - How was that? - Good, I think. - Did I get them all right? - Yes. Now mix the questions up. - Randomly? - Yes. I won't ask you the questions, go over them in your head then answer them. Let's see what you remember. - I'll get muddled up. - For sure. What's the point then? Tomorrow's reporters are famous and they don't mess around. - Let's start again. - I'll stand up. Okay, stand up, come on. Bruno Secondari, son of Mauro and Carolina. Nettuno has 53,000 inhabitants. Yes, I like living in Nettuno. Second year of middle school. It happened between 4 and 5 at night. In the morning. - In the morning. - Yeah. Between 4 and 5 in the morning. They told me right away. - Only child, no siblings. - But? But I have a friend who's like a brother, Tiziano. I call him Ciccio 'cause it's shorter. Say it here, go on. No, I'd rather not answer that. - Nice one, Bruno. - Then... Life goes on. Everyone's very close. The teachers are very caring and affectionate, they should always be like that. No siblings... I already said that. Me and my dad were very close... he died instantly... and then... Ciccio, I'm getting muddled up! Okay, say them in order then. Come on! But properly! Sitting down, with your hood on, properly. Properly... okay. Every day I play our special song and I try to cry. I end up singing along. I even danced to it, because we didn't listen to crap music! Maybe I should start listening to crap music! But then I won't know if I'm crying because I'm sad or because the music's crap. Ever since it happened, nothing's changed. I sleep really well, I'm eating like a pig, I wash... I'm fine. I feel really bad. I want and have to be sad. It's my right. I don't remember what he said to me on his last night. People always say things before they die, right? Every morning I lay the table like I did that last night. I pretend to cook pasta, then I sit there and wait. And nothing ever happens. You want to know how I am? This is how I am. Sorry, Carolina. I can't do this. Don't worry, everything will be fine. I reckon Canestelli already likes you. Really? - How tall are you? - I don't know, why? You must be 1.40 meters. - What shoe size are you? - 36. 36 is quite big, if everything goes well, you'll be 1.50 meters next year. - And so? - I reckon she's noticed. You're getting taller and she's worried that you won't like her next year. But she'll grow too. No, girls grow quicker, they do everything quicker. You know why she wants to wait till after the interview? - Why? - She wants to be certain about the future. If we'd still been there would it have happened? We're not there. But if we had been? We're not. I need you to tell me. Only you can tell me. Have we really been goddamn useless? Or did we do some good? If we'd still been there would it have happened? - Who is it? - I'll get it! I saw Canestelli. I was with my mum, I saw her with her sister. - Did she see you? - I spoke to her. - To her? - Who else? Her sister? Who's ugly, poor thing. I keep thinking about what you said, a girl can't be so nasty as to say something like that. Your dad died, not your dog. Then I forgot about it, we had a mission and I stopped thinking about it. Today I saw her so I asked her. What did you ask her? - It's important, an important thing. - What? - I asked her because we're friends. - What did you ask her? When will you go out with Bruno? After the interview or after it's on TV? That's all I asked her. "Bruno who?" That's what she replied. You never spoke to Canestelli. Why did you make it all up? We were friends, we had a pact. There's nothing you can do, Cesare. It happens to the best of families. Especially to those, in fact. It's always the wrong kid that dies. But congratulations, you did it. There's a martyr with your surname, happy now? At least he died in battle, as you said. That's quite an achievement. When will you win this war? You're the only ones dying. Good lad, you've said your little prayer. Now get lost. Go back to playing hide-and-seek. See what happens when sons do their dad's jobs? If I'd done it, I'd be pushing up daisies. You were born dead but you've yet to realize it. I've lost two sons, not one. But you didn't go to the first one's funeral. I'm not going to the second's either. Of course, it takes courage to go to the funeral of someone you killed. I'm going to shoot you now. That's the only reason I came back. At your birthday we always drew straws to see who'd give you the gift, and I always lost. I did it on purpose, he wanted to be the one. He was worried that you didn't love him. That's why he did the same job as you. It was the only way he could earn your love. Honey, do you want some warm milk? Shall I heat some up? May I? What's the matter? Has the cloudburst arrived? Okay... what did we say? When the cloudburst arrives we'll open the umbrella. I'm not coming to the funeral tomorrow. All right, don't come. I don't feel like coming. I know you don't, that's normal. I want to leave. I want to go live with grandma. I don't want to be here anymore. What you're feeling is completely normal. You don't need to worry. If I could, I wouldn't go tomorrow either. You don't want to go because you don't like dad anymore. What are you talking about? You don't care about him. I've seen you laugh loads of times. When people ask me. "How's your mum?", I should say... "Mum's laughing". But I don't. Did you put make-up on? You look like a koala. Why do you laugh? Why don't you ever cry? It's your fault that I can't cry either. I'm sorry. All week I've been trying to cry. But I can't. What does that mean? Don't try, just cry... It doesn't come naturally to me. I try every day, but I can't. What can I do? I want you to be sad. Sad... is that all? I want to go crazy. I want you to have a mum who's crazy with sorrow. Maybe I am becoming crazy. - Listen honey, dad... - Dad's gone. - I know he's gone. - No, you don't. What do you mean by that? It means you're not crying. Hold on, when have you cried? I'm a kid, I'm traumatized, maybe I'll cry as an adult. What the hell does that mean? That kids don't cry? That's nonsense! I cried all the time as a kid. When Grandma Carla died... who cried more, me or your dad? - I don't remember. - Oh, you don't? I was only 2. I did. I've always cried more than anyone else, always. Now I just can't do it! What do you want me to do? Kill myself because I can't cry? I'd love to have seen your dad, I'd loved to have seen him in this situation! Who has to go to this goddamn funeral full of TV cameras tomorrow, him or me? Damn me for agreeing to go! Of course I said yes, they were bombarding me with questions... So I said. "Yes!". Who dealt with the paperwork, phone calls, relatives, and lawyers? Did he deal with all that shit? No, I did. What do you all expect? Would you rather I acted like a possessed woman, cried my eyes out and swallowed a load of pills? That would've been simpler! But he's left me like this, without time to understand! How could he die like that? Well? There are some terrible illnesses, long ones, where you can prepare, discover your faith, find a way to say goodbye, for fuck's sake... you can't just die like this! I'm not crying, okay? When people ask you how I am, tell them that I'm laughing, it's fine! I don't know why I'm not crying, but it's my goddamn business, okay? Good morning, darling, happy birthday Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you You're so beautiful No one's as beautiful You're so sweet No one's as sweet And you speak so softly When you talk about us I'm enchanted when I look at you You're out of this world You're so sweet No, here it goes.. And you speak so softly When you talk about us Happy birthday, my darling When they called, I was sleeping. They called me to the sector, while you were still breathing. I could've hurried there and looked you in the face. I could've told you that it was nothing, that you would make it. I could've gone in the ambulance, listened to what they were saying, made sure no one got distracted. I could've showed them the quick route to the hospital. But I was sleeping. I, who never slept at night for almost 30 years, was sleeping. I did nothing for you. Sorry, my son. I apologize.. for letting you die like that in the world where I became a man and where I wanted you to become one. Sorry for realizing too late that it would become the world in which sons die, while fathers find themselves alone asking themselves why. I miss you. I've always missed you. I've always missed you all. And only now do I realise how much you have all missed me. Do you want some? I made too much. Want some or not? No, I'll eat later with Bruno. I'll eat later with Bruno. You can re-heat it, it's even tastier that way. Is it okay? - It's too salty. - No. You don't use enough salt. It's too salty. Fine, it is, but you don't use enough salt. You're a country girl, let's not forget that. The country's nice... Where everything is poetry. Where you discover your first love in a barn. Where your best friends are animals that end up on your plate on Sundays. That explains the lack of salt! I'd better go, it's late. TO THOSE WHO REMAIN
