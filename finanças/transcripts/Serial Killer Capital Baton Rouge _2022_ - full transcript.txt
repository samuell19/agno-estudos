Several women were victimized in Baton Rouge. People that had high-risk lifestyles that were killed. There were women that were take from their homes and killed. We knew we had a serial killer operating in the city of Baton Rouge. I think that the fear at Baton Rouge at that point was starting to get at a tipping point. Remain calm. I know there's a lot of fear in the city and I feel it. I didn't even know he was a serial killer. I believe I survived because God needed to use someone to bring justice for their loved ones. A break in the Louisiana serial killer case. An arrest warrant for Derrick Todd Lee has been issued at East Baton Rouge Parish. On the charges of first-degree murder and aggravated rape. For the city of Baton Rouge, it was a collective sigh of relief. And then as soon as you can take a breath and you realize that that's over, it's not over. We have these murders that are different happening in downtown Baton Rouge. Could we have another serial killer? Katherine Hall was significantly cut where you could actually see the bone. On Johnnie Mae Williams, we discovered her hands had been removed. Donna Bennett Johnston, one of her arms had been severed from the elbow down. You've got these ritualistic cuttings. This is a totally different animal. They absolutely know at this point, this is serial killer number two. I couldn't even imagine what type of person would do this. It didn't make any sense. And there was more female victims popping up around town. It was incredible to even contemplate. And then the next one happened. But could there be a third serial killer? ♪ Like a whisper in the hollow ♪ Tears fall down while they pray for tomorrow ♪ ♪ Nobody knows Nobody sees ♪ ♪ Search back of roads and cold city streets ♪ ♪ There's evil in the dark ♪ ♪ Blood on the hands and the devil will follow ♪ February of '04, the body of Donna Johnston was recovered in a remote canal near LSU. When they were working the Donna Johnston scene, we discovered a tire track. The tire that we were looking at was ultimately identified was a Goodyear Aquatred 3. When we identified the individuals that had the tire from Goodyear, one of those was Sean Vincent Gillis. The following day, I went to see Mr. Gillis at his residence. That's when we asked him for his swab. He readily volunteered to provide a DNA sample. Sean agreed to come down to the office for questioning. Before he got in the vehicle, he smoked half his cigarette, and he threw it on the ground, and he said, "Let's get this over with." My first impression of Sean was that he was an intelligent person, well-spoken. He seemed at ease, but you could tell there was some underlying tension. The question then moved on to, had he ever been out to that field where Donna Johnston's body was found? And he said, yes, he had been familiar with that pasture out there, that he used to go out there frequently to smoke weed. He said, in fact, couple nights prior, that he had gone out there on his way home. Gillis claimed that he had to use the restroom, so he proceeded to this field where the body was located to get out and do his thing. So he put himself at that location where her body was. We said, "Well, why would you go there instead of going to your house? It would've been very easy for him to just go directly home. It wouldn't have been hardly any longer to get there, and it just didn't make sense. He made some incredible statements that really tied into the victims, along with the fact that he said he knew Johnnie Mae and she had frequently ridden in his vehicle with him, and he had had sex with her. He put himself at that location where Donna Johnston's body was found. Once he admitted that his car had absolutely made the tire track and that he had backed up exactly where the car would have backed up to dump the body, it became apparent that it was him. It was obvious he was starting to panic because of some of the things he said, which was only pointing a finger more at him. After several hours of questioning, Mr. Gillis, he didn't confess to anything. And he looked at me and he said, "Jeff, you told me you'd take me home when I'm ready to go home. And I'm ready to go home." We were 99% sure it was him. We had developed probable cause. We certainly could have charged him at that point, but we wanted to make sure that we weren't wrong. We put surveillance on Mr. Gillis the minute he got home. At this point, it was just a waiting game for the crime lab to give us a word whether his DNA was a match. Within four hours, they got a hit. "We've got a match, and the killer of these women is, in fact, Sean Vincent Gillis." "Sean's DNA has matched to all three of our victims. It's him. Absolutely, it's him." I drafted an arrest warrant for him for the murder of Katherine Hall, Johnnie Mae Williams, and Donna Bennett Johnston. Once the warrants were signed, SWAT hits the house. My name is Terri Lemoine and I lived with Sean Gillis for nine years. April 29th, 2004, I was off that night and home. And for some reason, Sean came to bed at the same time I did, which was something he never did. Not even 10 seconds after I had turned the light off, there was what sounded like a crash in the kitchen. And people were yelling, and all of a sudden, the door got kicked in to the bedroom. And I'm standing in my bedroom, in my bed clothes, with a bunch of policemen around me. And I'm wanting to know what is going on. I want to know what's going on right now. The policemen turned around, and looked at me and said, "You didn't know you were living with a serial killer?" It was probably the most disturbing interrogation I've ever heard in my life. Gillis liked to talk about what he did in vivid detail. He really enjoyed the attention. Once we opened those floodgates, it was hard to shut him up. I' With a bunch of policemen around me. I'm wanting to know what is going on. And the policeman turned around and looked at me and said, "You didn't know you were living with a serial killer?" I looked over at Sean and he shrugged his shoulders. And said, "Sorry, honey bunny." I met Sean Gillis, working the night shift at a convenience store. One of my friends decided that we should meet because we had a whole lot in common. Same likes, dislikes, movies. He made me laugh too. He was a geeky guy, the kind you'd wanna bring home to mom. I basically worked most of the time. I went to work at night from 11:00 to 7:00. But Sean would always stay home He didn't wanna go anywhere, didn't wanna do anything. That makes me angry to think back. Sean reminded me of someone who never wanted to grow up. I didn't know how to feel, because, in a way, it made me responsible because I was taking care of Sean. It made me feel like I was giving him the wherewithal to do what he wanted. When you have a lot of time to think, you question a lot of decisions that you made. And when the policeman turned around and said, "You didn't know you were living with a serial killer," I just looked at him, I said, "Boy, have you got the wrong house?" I've told that to people over and over. None of what they were saying made any sense. There was no way possible. Not Sean. No way. We said, "We absolutely have him on Katherine Hall, Johnnie Mae Williams, and Donna Bennett Johnston. "He can't deny that." We knew that he absolutely had more victims. So our interview strategy was gonna be we're not gonna press him real hard. We knew, from his prior interrogation, that, you know, he liked to talk. He just got to a point where he was kind of consigned to the fact that he was caught. And I said, "Why don't you tell us any others, Sean." And I remember he said, "Do you have a pencil?" Once we opened those floodgates, it was hard to shut him up. And he wanted to talk and talk and talk. He really enjoyed the attention. He identified several homicides that he had committed. It seemed to be important for him to have more bodies to his credit than Derrick Todd Lee. He knew that Derrick Todd Lee had already been arrested and was in the process of going to trial. He'd been following it. In addition to the three homicides that we were working, he confessed to killing Ann Bryan, Joyce Williams, Marilyn Nevils, Hardee Schmidt, and Lillian Robinson. All were women who were killed in the Baton Rouge area in the years previous to catching him. He was very meticulous. He gave us names, places, graphic details at each scene, intimate details about each victim. The Johnnie Mae Williams case, he said that, one night, he and Johnnie Mae were riding around, and, you know they were doing their drugs, listening to music. And he said he pulled off behind a restaurant in the southeast part of Baton Rouge. He said they were just sitting there, listening to music, and he said Johnnie Mae actually fell asleep. He said something just took over. And so he said, "I just slipped it around her neck and killed her." As soon as you can take a breath and realize that that's over, it's not over. Many plenty other cold cases that have remained unsolved. He started choking me, put both of his hands on either side of my neck, and he just started squeezing. A suspected serial killer is behind bars tonight. I think I survived because I had a purpose. Once Sean Gillis started confessing, he talked and talked. He gave us names, places, intimate details. It was probably the most disturbing interrogation I've ever heard in my life. With Katherine Hall's body, the most striking thing was the cuttings. He talked about when he cut Katherine Hall's leg, he said he cut it deep and he said it kind of laid open. He said that the moonlight had hit her bone and "It was so white, I just wanted to touch it." Sean told us that he had the perfect situation with his relationship with Terri. He would drive her to work and drop her off, he said, which basically gave him eight free hours to roam the streets, and he actually called it hunting, "to go hunting." Sean Gillis has confessed to the murder of at least eight women. Gillis led members of the task force to locations where he allegedly hid the bodies of his victims. After going to court and listening to how some of the things occurred one thing I had found out was that he had dismembered one of his victims on the kitchen floor. And I made a point to go home and tear up my floor in the kitchen. And as I was pulling it up, underneath the tile, there was still big spots of blood. It made me feel guilty and then it made me feel angry because I was feeling guilty. And everybody told me I wasn't supposed to feel guilty. How can you not? So many people have asked me, "How could you not know?" Why would I know? If your husband stays gone for an odd amount of time, and you're gonna think he's off I'll say the word, actually killing someone? First thing you're gonna think about is, "Oh, he might be seeing another woman." This was a letter that Sean wrote to me right after he was arrested in 2004. "My dearest Terri, thank you so much for the last eight years. I wish we had 80 more. I have never loved a woman so much that each day from you seems like a year. The closer my time daws near, the less courage I have. I do not wanna die this way. I know there is something wrong with my brain, but no one gives a damn to check it out. Well, it's not over until it's over. Love you so much, Honey Bunny. Sean." Excuse me. I know I can't change anything that happened. I mean, I would if I could. Sean took away the lives of those people. I can't let him take away mine also. The first full day of testimony underway of the first-degree murder trial of accused serial killer Derrick Todd Lee. The trial itself was surreal. It's like being caught in a story that can't be true, but you can't get out of it. My being in the same room with Derrick Todd Lee wasn't strange for me because I had prayed. I prayed and asked God to let me face him, and let me look him in the eye so that he would know that I know what he had done to me. God bless Dianne Alexander. Dianne Alexander spoke for the dead. She spoke for all the women who came before her who had lost their lives in a violent way. She was the voice of the dead through her life. She is unflappable. And she identified him absolutely positively with no reservations, and that's the deal. She is the nail in his coffin. And when the verdict came down, we were so happy, and you get such an intense relief. We thought when it came back so quickly... I'm sorry. I just can't believe it's finally happened. I'm overwhelmed. Authorities say Derrick Lee and serial killer Sean Gillis together have killed 15 women, but there are many, many other cold cases that have remained unsolved. Authorities say about 60 women have been murdered in and around Baton Rouge since 1992. With the trial of Derrick Todd Lee and the trial of Sean Vincent Gillis, we have two serial killers being tried for killing women in Baton Rouge. At the same time, they got homicides that's not solved yet They're both in jail now. There's still a lot of unsolved homicides. There's also more female victims popping up around town. We had quite a few high-risk lifestyle women killed in the same general area, Florida Edwards and also Sylvia Cobb. I think that law enforcement was concerned that because they were both posed, both bound in areas that were frequented by drug users and prostitutes, that these victims may have been murdered by the same person. It was incredible to even contemplate, but could there be a third serial killer here at Baton Rouge. It's been more than two years and four month since LSU grad student Murray Pace was brutally murdered. Louisiana investigators are searching for more possible victims of alleged serial killer Derrick Todd Lee. In 2002, while law enforcement is investigating the deaths of Gina Green and Murray Pace, there were a lot of murders in downtown Baton Rouge, under somewhat different circumstances. I think it was just concern that, "Oh, we've got another dead woman here. I mean, what is going on?" And then the next one happened. We got a phone call from a local resident that observed a female body near the south side of the old Dillard's store. This was the place where the body was discovered on that morning. Ten feet from the building south of the structure. She was in a flower bed, just about this area here. The victim is laid on her back. Her legs was positioned between the two smaller trees. Her shirt was pulled above her breast area near her throat. She was laid out in the flower bed. It appeared that she had been posed. It was obvious she was strangled because there was blood on her T-shirt. It appears that the shirt that was on her body may have been used as a ligature to choke and strangle the victim. She was found in downtown Baton Rouge closer to where Sylvia and Florida were found. The three murders had several things in common. All three of the victims appeared to be sexually assaulted. And all three of them were in areas where there were drugs, prostitution, high-risk areas. We processed the crime scene and the victim was identified as Renee Newman. DNA was ultimately run on the evidence found on Florida Edwards' body as well as evidence on Renee Newman's body. They connected those two, but they didn't know who the killer was. Working as a homicide detective, you really wanna solve every case that you work. You wanna bring closure to the families. It takes a toll on you as an investigator. You always thinking about the case that you're working. You always thinking, "What is i I could've done different, what clues I may have overlooked." While investigating Renee Newman's homicide, we received a tip that maybe Sean Vincent Gillis may have known her. That prompted us to interview Sean Gillis relative to that investigation. Sean was very forthcoming with the previous murder investigations. I would actually say in the ones involving Renee Newman and also the ones done in Baton Rouge, since he was accused of killing high-risk lifestyle women. Sometimes it takes a killer to know a killer and Sean can shed life not only on himself as being a killer but also any additional killers that he may know. Sean told me that, while he was out there searching for a victim, he observed another hunter, another serial killer. He said, "I'm telling you, when our eyes locked, we both knew exactly why we were there. Sean would not tell me what the other hunter looked like. I guess maybe they've got some kind of strict code of conduct when it comes to killers recognizing other killers not to divulge who the other person was. He refused to give that and that's when the interview stopped. I am Johnnie Martinez. I decided to catch my bus to go to the store to get me some medications. I get off of the bus, but the store is still a ways around from where the bus is. On the right-hand side, there's a big bush, wooded area. And as I'm walking down the pathway, I see a man coming down towards me. He was walking towards the bus stop. He said, "You have some extra change?" When I reached out to give it to him, he grabbed my wrist. He threw a punch, kind of dazed me a bit. And when I look, he was drawing me towards those big old woods. And I was helpless. There was nothing I could do to prevent him from taking me in there. He was a lot larger than me, real kind of big-looking guy. He had droopy cheeks like Droopy the dog. That's how I remembered him, by his cheeks. I determined that I would give him the same eye each time he went to punch me because I saw him with the other eye and I wanted to make sure that if I would get out of there alive, that I wanted to be able to identify. I think I survived because I had a purpose. God only knows what your purpose is. And he presents it to you at that point in your life. He started choking me, put both of his big fat hands on either side of my neck and he just started squeezing. Johnnie decided the best way to survive was to tell him, as he tried to sexually assault her, that she had AIDS. She did not have AIDS, but she was hoping that would keep her from being sexually assaulted. Once he couldn't rape me, there was not much he could do but steal my purse. She decided that she had a chance to survive if she just played dead. I take a little breath and close my eyes. And I feel him get off of me. And once he got off of me, I waited a few more seconds. And he was gone. I get a call and the call is in reference to someone that was beaten, possibly attempted rape, really in bad condition. And they said, "Hey, the person that's injured you know, and she says she knows you well." And I said, "Well, who would that be?" And it was Johnnie. And, you know, I was shocked. Johnnie worked at a fast food restaurant that, during our patrol hours, I would go over there and eat. And me and Johnnie became really good friends. I immediately got dressed and I went to the hospital. I can tell you this, I walked into the room and I stood to the back of the room. And when I saw her, pretty much, tears came from my eyes. I had one big swollen eye with knots on the side of it. I had marks all on the side of my neck. I looked just like a monster. My friends came to visit me after it happened. They were all crying, and it hurt me more because I didn't want them to cry for me. We knew that her purse was missing. She said she had a debit card and it had, possibly, $700 or so on it. So we asked her to make the phone call. He took her purse, and he went to an ATM, and he used her card at the ATM. And they have a beautiful picture of him using the card. So this was the break we was looking for. I threw the picture down. I said, "Man, that's the guy." That was him. He said, "You sure?" I said, "I'm positive." Remember I told you he had droopy cheeks? Look at his droopy cheeks on there. She immediately identified the guy, the best feeling ever. Police identified him as Jeffery Guillory and found that he had frequented, I think, a halfway house that was in close proximity to where she was attacked. We found that Guillory was from Lake Charles, was from a family of 10. He had several convictions including burglary and drug convictions. So our detective got a warrant for his arrest for that particular case with using the ATM machine with a stolen credit card. When he was arrested for the attack on Johnnie Martinez, police took his fingerprints as well as his DNA. The DNA evidence that was taken from Florida Edwards as well as Renee Newman was in the system, and it was a hit. It was also able to match Jeffery Guillory's fingerprint to that of a beer can left at crime scene of Sylvia Cobb on North Arcadian. Jeffery Lee Guillory was charged today for the murders of three women, Florida Edwards, Sylvia Cobb, and Renee Newman. Investigators questioned him about Sylvia Cobb. They questioned him about Renee Newman and they questioned him about Florida Edwards. He denied knowing the females, but he was engaged in the conversation. I showed him eight photographs of the victims that was killed in that same area. Jeffery said he did not know any of the women. But he eventually said he knew Sylvia Cobb. The body of Sylvia Cobb was found in the same general area, in an abandoned house. This is all kind of close to downtown Baton Rouge. He knew her but he had never been at the house where her body was discovered. At times, he would smile and he was not intimidated. He seemed so calm and so cool. He was totally unruffled. He just continued to deny any involvement. We had Jeffery DNA at a crime scene, so as an investigator, I'm thinking that he's gonna admit to what he did because we could prove that his DNA was there. I'm thinking that he's gonna man up and say, "I was there. I did kill the victims." He never did admit to it, you know, so what do you get from that? How do you assess a person who don't wanna admit to the truth? Still, he's a killer, and I knew he was because of the fact that we were able to trace him to these three crime scenes. Authorities call Jeffery Lee Guillory a suspected serial killer, making him the third man accused of that title in the Baton Rouge area in the last 10 years. Guillory's fingerprints were found at the scene of Sylvia Cobb's murder but says DNA evidence links Guillory to both Newman and Edwards. The mother of one alleged victim is still in Baton Rouge tonight. Ora Lee Jackson, was at a loss for words after news of today's arrest in the death of Sylvia Cobb. I cried and seemed that I couldn't get that together, couldn't eat, couldn't sleep. And I said, "Well, thank you, Jesus. They found the killer." Johnnie Martinez came to trial in order to make sure that Jeffery Guillory would never be able to harm another woman. Finally, we have our guy for these murders that occurred in 1999, 2001, and 2002. With the arrest of Jeffery Guillory, now we have a third serial killer that's taken off the streets of Baton Rouge. I think that Jeffery's also responsible for the other homicides that took place in Baton Rouge. A proximately 13 females with high-risk lifestyle was murdered in the same manner. I think he's also responsible for those murders as well. The arrest of serial killer Derrick Todd Lee, serial killer Sean Vincent Gillis, and serial killer Jeffery Guillory, all in Baton Rouge, all within a very short time period. The whole city was relieved, but the amount of loss and the amount of sadness, it's hard. There was such grief for the mothers of those women, such grief, that I don't think that that sorrow has ever gone away. The families of the victims of Derrick Todd Lee was a huge support from sharing that common horror. We felt very connected. We weren't alone. We had each other. I don't want to be overcritical of the police because I really do think they did the best they could. I do think that. Before AFIS, before CODIS, before all those systems kind of created a network for law enforcement, things were very isolated. You could commit crimes in two counties in the same state. They wouldn't connect. That would be the question there. They're dropping this name that he's a serial killer. None of this really makes sense. They were still utterly convinced that Randy's ex-husband was the person who had killed her. I told them that the whole time while you're investigating me, the person responsible is still out there. And he killed six more women after that. In 1998, they did not run Derrick Lee's DNA, and think how that would've changed the world. Why didn't you ever try to get a DNA sample? Had that been the perfect world of now, Derrick Todd Lee, he would've been caught right away. We wanted to get Derrick Todd Lee's DNA. It was early on in the DNA era as what DNA could do and never had training on DNA up to the end, and really never understood it, what it could do. I mean, I understand what fingerprints can do. But being a small agency, we didn't know a whole lot about DNA. It was frustrating. There's probably mistakes we made too, and like I say, throughout my years of working investigations from '94 to 2010, it taught me a lot. And I think more communication would've been better on this case, and maybe we could've stopped some murders. That's a thing that you can't think about too much, the fact that, had they run that DNA in 1998, that Murray, Gina, Pam, Carrie, Dene, all of them would be alive 'cause he would've been caught. It's just one of those horrible turns of life. The wounds of that time are still open, it's not healed yet. The wounds are still fresh today as it was back in the '90s and 2000s as well. It still haunts the city because that's a dark part of our history. There are so many women who had been murdered whose cases were unsolved. And that's one thing you think of with ours, that we were fortunate to know what happened, and to know who and what and why, as much as you can know why. Eugenie Boisfontaine. Dianna Williams. Tannis Walker. Patricia Harkins. It's upsetting to read so many names of so many victims that were killed during that period of time. And it's also upsetting that their killer was never made answerable for those murders. It may have been Jeffery Guillory. It may have been Derrick Todd Lee. It may have been Sean Vincent Gillis, or it may have been somebody totally unrelated. But their families have even less answers and have never received justice.
