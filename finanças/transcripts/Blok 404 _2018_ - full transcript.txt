My dear. -What's this about? -My dear... Don't touch me! Let me go now! -My dear, get yourself out of this! -I don't know! Oh my God, my dear! Keep quiet! Do you really have to scream for all horror movies? -You just can't stop screaming! -What horror movie is this? Keep quiet! Now you are quiet! R. Rahman. No! Calm down. Calm down. Now I can carry out my job peacefully. Do you love your husband? Do you? Your husband has cheated many people. You think you are rich, you are powerful, you can do whatever you like. What if the same thing happens to your family, how would you feel? Have you tried human's flesh? Human flesh. Want to try it? Do you want? Do you see this? See this? Eat it! Satisfied? Our menu for tonight... fresh meat. Fresh meat, delicious? Delicious? Now let's try the hen's meat. The hen's meat. That smell... You must be enjoying the smell of the hen's meat. Your useless wife spent all your money! You took bribes! You spent all your money on your wife. Good, both are flesh eaters! Forbidden meat. Great! Eat more! Great! Bribery! You accepted bribes. You greedy man! Bi... Gosh! Bi, watch this. Watch this. You'll surely like it. -I don't want. -Just watch it. -Watch this. -I don't want that. What's that? -This is... -This is, yes... This is a video for adults. Adults should watch it. How are you going to practice with Hairi? Bring it here. Watch it. That's good. Hey, Intan. Don't scare me. I'm driving. I don't like videos like this. The question now is is it real? Who knows it might be his wife's plan. Many people like to make viral videos and upload them. Because they want views, likes, and they want followers. -Yes! -And that brings money. It's a business! When people see an accident, -You're right. -they take videos instead of helping. At least they take videos, so that people know what's happening. We are of a society... Husin's got the key to that room. It can't be opened. Brother Wan, I think Brother Husin doesn't seem to like me working here. No such thing. You are still new here. Furthermore, that's Husin. Just leave it. Soon, he'll be fine. Here, clean that room. -Okay. -Okay. Still a long way to go? We'll be arriving soon. It's just there. A little bit more. The place we're going to, I heard the DJs are from the US. Do you like it? You would love it. We're stuck here. -It's not working. -What happened? It's not working. It's broken. -Broken? -Seriously? -It's broken. -What's broken? It's totally broken. -So what is broken? -Broken. The gasket is broken. All gone. Why don't you call someone? Who am I going to call? There's no signal here. -What no signal? -Phone signal! Why didn't you send the car for servicing? I lent you the car. You should send it for servicing. When did you lend it to me? I have my own car. -I did lend it to you! -Bi! -Why did you have to push me away? -Enough. Go away! Don't fight. We are in the middle of nowhere. Still want to fight? Dwan! I don't get it. He... He's not into me. Hey, Giena. What are you doing there? You can't just go in like that. This is a guest room. Chill, I just want to have fun. Bi! There's nothing here. Nothing. -Are you serious? -Yes, I am. I'm not joking. Bi. I saw a signboard just now. But I'm not sure it's a chalet or a homestay. -Where is it? -There. -What are we waiting for? Let's go. -Let's go. I was trapped. -I didn't know she's in that room... -Wait a minute... Relax... I understand, and I see something's wrong with that lady. No. Not with that lady. Something is wrong with this place. I can feel very strong bad energy here which is not good for you and me. Let's just leave this place. Let's go! This will be fun! Luckily Intan saw the signboard. Can you stop talking nonsense? -This is just my first day working here. -That's good! Let it be your last day as well. I'm checking out tomorrow. Misha. Are you okay? Yeah, we are all good. -Sha, those things in the kitchen... -Okay, I'm going now. Are you okay, Bro? Okay. You don't seem to talk much, do you? Yeah, maybe I talk more to the nature. Okay. Bro, where's Hairi? Can you please help me to find him? I think he's having a diarrhea. Can you please look for him. Hairi! -Gosh! I'm worried! -Why are you looking for him? Worried? You are worried. You still love him. I thought you don't love him, you are not worried about him anymore. Hairi! Hairi! -Hairi! Where are you? -Has he gone to the guest house? Come to papa... Relax. Come, take your stuff. Bro! There's a surprise. Hurry up! It's going to be fun. Hey, be careful. It's sharp! Oh. It's Dwan's girl. I've been here for days and there's no one. So boring. What should I do? If you are bored, take a walk in the jungle. You can play in the stream. Your friends in the jungle must have missed you. -Funny. -Yeah, funny. Look at this. Relax. Look at this. Check out the surprise. Surprise! It's beautiful, isn't it? She's probably mad. There's no other men here. Are you serious? The longer you work here, the more characters you'll find here. This is just the tip of the iceberg. So, just ignore it. -Okay. -Okay, I bought some fruits cut them for tonight. Let's go. There're no girls here. Bro, it's so boring here. Bi, come here. -Let's pack up. -Okay. Relax. I'm a human being. Oh, really? I stay there too. It's like we're fated to meet each other. Yeah, it's fate all right. Hairi. -Giena. -Giena. He's my boy friend. I'm Intan. Hello! And you? I'm Zul, and I'm single. Perfect. Let's go. I'll show you guys the way. Don't be jealous. -Oh yes. -It's more beautiful there is it? -Hurry up. -Be careful. This is such a nice place. So beautiful. -Hey, Zul! -Be careful. Who would have thought there's such a nice place here in the middle of the jungle. So beautiful. This place is really cool! Awesome! -The signboard is horrible but inside... -This is so cool! Who is that? Dwan. He's a bit weird. Let's go. -You guys must be hungry and thirsty. -Yes, hungry and thirsty. Welcome to your new home, guys. Zul, have a seat there. See, Misha. I should be working here. I only went out for a while but I brought back three guests. Thanks, Giena. Welcome. What types of rooms do you have here? There's no vacant room here? Which monkey threw the rubbish there? Only monkeys litter, monkeys! Monkeys, do you know? Husin, take this rubbish and throw it into the rubbish bin, problem solved, okay? Here. Husin. Please get the lamps ready for the barbecue tonight. -Hello guys, how are you? -Hello, everything's okay. -Where are you from? -We're supposed to go to another place. But our car broke down, at the end of the stream. We were stranded there. -So... -It's far. Bro! Bro! Brother, is there any workshop nearby? Workshop? I'm not sure. Okay, leave your car there first. Tomorrow I'll help you with it, okay? Relax, guys. This is a nice place. Stay here because we are having a barbecue party tonight. -Barbecue... -Barbecue... How's the room? We have two deluxe rooms. We have rooms with four beds, and we have cabins as well. You may choose whichever you want. -We'll take the... -I want the master bedroom. Why don't you just share with the girl? Bro! -Where are you staying? -The room over there. It's okay, Bro... -So which room do you want? -Master bedroom. -Master bedroom. -The key. Okay. It's RM200 for a deluxe room. Here's the key. No WiFi here? Sorry guys. Our concept here is "back to nature". No phone signal, no internet no TV, sorry. It's okay. You guys can enjoy. Enjoy the nature here, okay? Back to nature. Boring. -Thank you. -Okay. -Enjoy. -All right. Okay. -Enjoy! Be more gentle! -Okay, Bro. What's wrong? I haven't posted the review. Oh my... But I can't do so. Just forget about it. You're on vacation, right? Forget about it? It's easy for you to say so. Well, you are on vacation. Aren't you? This is great. We got a cheap room. Everything's okay. The room is spacious. Close to nature. I feel like something's wrong. What's wrong? You or me? Bi? Husin. Next time, mind your language if you want to warn people. People don't know you. I don't like. Monkeys litter. Only monkeys litter. I don't like. Yes, I understand. You did all that. One more thing, I don't know why Misha works here. Husin. I need to have a female receptionist. Then only I can attract guests. Do you understand? Of course I can't place a fierce man like you as a receptionist. This is my place! My place! I take care of this place! I take care of it! I clean this place! I take care of it! I take care of it. Not you! It's me! I take care of it! New water cleanses old water. It's time for you to fly. It was your choice, Wan. It was yours. You're outside. I was looking for you in the room. Everyone's downstairs. Why don't you join the barbecue? No. I want to rest for a while. I'll just stay in the room. Dwan, can you stop scaring yourself? There's nothing. Chill. -No. -Enough with the nonsense. If your brother knows you're not joining, he'll be mad. Hurry up. Bi. Okay? Get up. Can I join? I want to change the playlist. Bi, what is this? -What? -See it for yourself! -What? -See! Bi. Is she so good that you can't move on? -Bi, I... -Answer me! Intan, we're enjoying ourselves. I don't like this. Relax, Intan. -It's just a small matter. -Small matter? Both of you are the same! -That's it! -Bi... -Bi, wait! -No! Bi, calm down. -Bi. -Don't touch me! -Don't follow me! -Okay, fine! -Your loss! -Shut up! Your loss! Intan. Okay guys. Our drama has ended. Can we continue with our party? -Yes. -Sure. Who's that? Who's that? What do you want, Hairi? Please, leave me alone! Are you deaf? Wearing a mask? In the end, you crawled back to me. Why don't you just go to that woman? I know. You wanna have fun? You are not Hairi. Who are you? Go away! Hairi love... Hairi... Wait a minute, I'm still looking at it. -I'm waiting to show my cards. -Okay. This is the best! -Wait, Bro. Don't. -This.... Surely... Take it! -Done? -That's all I have. I've expected you to lose. The injection I gave you will make you immobile. But you will still feel the pain. The chicken is not done yet. I want chicken too. I've told you it's not done yet. You want uncooked chicken? -Which one is done? -This one. Take this sausage. Sorry about what happened... I was scolded by my girl friend. I feel so embarrassed. You have a pretty face, but bad attitude. Pretty face, bad attitude. I'll slash your face. There's one more thing that I don't like. I don't like. Monkeys like you like to litter. Like who? Like you. The earth becomes a trash because of scumbags like you. I was like... It's my fate, right? It's okay. At least, that was my experience on the first day of working here. -First day? Good. -Yeah. How's your first day? Okay? Go and console your girl friend. She'll be fine. Let her cool herself down first. I'll talk to her tomorrow morning. Scumbag. Your pretty and fair hand shouldn't belong to you. I want all of you who's watching this video considers this as a lesson. So that our earth will always be clean. Clean. Yes. Clean. You are an artist, aren't you? No, I'm not. Don't lie. The first day you arrived here, I already knew you are an artist. There's a drama that you acted in, I love it so much! Your acting is really good. Oh really? Which drama... Oh, I know! Yeah. But, if people know the hero of the drama got scolded got cursed by his girlfriend, it will be so embarrassing. But, I can still be a hero to you. Just one is not enough for men, is it? Men? It's not that one girl is not enough, it's just not satisfying enough. Because they have not found the right one. That's why men can have four wives. -So... -Hey. Where are the rest? There's still so much food. Who will finish it? Dwan has gone to the toilet. But I think he's gone for too long. But Brother Wan, maybe he feels uneasy, as he doesn't like a crowd. Okay. I understand. Zul and Giena? I think you'd better go and see Dwan, to see if he's okay. Disgusting. The toilet's just over there. Come on. Hurry up. I know you want some actions, come in. -Where are you bringing me? -Sorry. Get into the room. Want to explore somewhere else? You know you want it. Not here, silly. In there. Let's go. Misha. You spooked me. So... You've been with Intan for a long time? Almost one year. Not too long. But lots of things happened within this one year. I really got it from her. If that is so, why don't you just break up with her? You don't know her? She's a famous model. She's got like... one million followers! So, her followers don't want us to break up. I only have very few followers. Followers? Oh. Okay. -Those social media. -Yes! They follow us on Instagram and things like that. So you are like relying on her. In a way, it's just my luck. Well... Do you love her? You must be wondering why I'm always alone. I don't really mix around. I don't know, I feel like maybe God gave me a gift. In which I would really trust myself. I trust my own instinct. I can even read people. I can even read you. Yeah. Okay. So what do you think of me? Okay. You are a really nice girl, of course. You're independent. Okay, you have a strong characteristic that... Okay. You would do anything to make your family proud of you. People around you, especially your family, right? I told you I could read people. Wow. This place is so nice. -It's like some kind of shooting scene. -Beautiful! There's a bed, right? Wow. Oh, this is good! I like this place. -It's so kinky. -Come on... Hey. Hurry up. Let's go. No! -You're naughty. -Baby. Wow. There's a camera. We can make a video. -Okay. -Okay. It's recording now. Come. It's been a long time since I last saw my family. It's been a long time. A long time. I'm a traveler. That's why I'm here. I like to be alone. I prefer to be alone, talk to myself. I feel like... Yeah. I think it has been three four or five years I've been away from my family. That's very long. You've not seen them or contacted them at all? I think they must have thought that I'm dead. Yeah. If I'm in love with her I wouldn't have kept other women's photos in my phone, Brother. I understand. I can totally understand. I used to be in love as well. I had girl friends before too. But I'm loyal. Then what happened? She left me. But yeah, sometimes... When we really hope for something to work out, it won't work out. Trust me, there's always a reason behind all that. There's wisdom. Yeah, I know I look horrible. It's okay. I'll go in first. So you have a room here? Which room do you stay? No, I don't stay here. I stay out, in my house. -Okay? -Okay. -Right. -Okay, good night. Let me just relax first, then I'll go in. -Okay, Brother. -Okay. Thank you. So much fun. You should've let me have fun first! You're killing the vibe here! This is a sin! -This is a sin! -Sin? She's just my toy! What should I do now? It's too late! -Hurry up! -Hurry up! Action! Sin! You're committing sin! I don't like people committing sin here! Sin! -Brother. -Yes? Is he asleep? Yes. Okay? I think so. Okay. Brother Wan. I'm going to clean up outside. Are you okay? Drink some water. You scared me. Why are you not back to your room yet? It's already late. Oh man! You. You. You are still working now? Yeah, you want to help me clean up? If Brother Husin sees this mess, he'll give me a piece of his mind. Don't you pity me? Pity you. You are like Cinderella. Getting scolded and everything. Oh man. Hey, you... Have you seen Bro Zul? -Bro Zul? -Bro Zul. Where else could he be? Of course with Giena. -Okay. -Have you known him for a long time? Two, or three months. Hairi. How did your car broke down in this area? You did plan to come here? No. Actually Bro Zul asked us to go to a private party with him. And our car was full with stuff. And then, our car broke down. So, we are here. Oh, now I understand. You don't want to accompany me? -Pity me, doing this all alone. -No. -I'm helping you. -Okay. Wan. Sue? Dwan. Wake up, Dwan. This is my bed. Dwan. Wake up, Dwan. This is my bed. Dwan. Hey! Who are you? What do you want? Relax! It's me, Bro Zul. -Gosh. You... -Why are you dressed like this? I was just playing a prank on you. So painful! What is this? Why are you alone in the room? There are so many girls downstairs. I was already sleeping. I didn't want to go out. It's so boring at places like this. You sleep so early. I don't want to join. I'd rather sleep. You may leave if you want to. I want to continue sleeping. You are not fun at all. I just want to enjoy private party with music. Are you okay? Okay. I'm okay. Actually, I'm happy with my life now. I'm calmer when I'm here. Far away from the hustle and bustle of Kuala Lumpur. Right. And you look much better now. I'm... I'm still the same. Talking about the past I was wrong. I'm sorry. You know right? It was really hard for me but I had to do what I did. It's okay, Sue. I've long forgotten about it. Let bygones be bygones. Why are you only meeting me now? I think I like you. You are down-to-earth. Not like Intan. She's such a baby. Oh wow! Hairi, do you know? I'm just a guest house worker and you are a famous celebrity! So great celebrities like us... We are human beings like you too. Wait. I didn't mention great celebrities. Did I? -It's okay. -You're stuck-up. Hey, do you want to be my girl friend? You're unsure how your girl friend is, and now you're flirting with me? If I were Intan, I would have cut you into two pieces. Take this as well. You like to play rough, huh? Husin. Do your part, Husin. Hold on! Camera first. Okay? Action. Do you know the story of "Tanggang"? Do you? Do you? Do you still think of your mom? Do you still think of your dad? Do you know where your home is? Do you know that they miss you? Do you? Bi. Hairi. Dwan. What are those? Legs. What? Legs. Sue. I still love you. I love you. I love you, Sue. What is this? I'm married. I'm sorry. -Hairi... -Yes. Can you see if that's blood. Blood? Where's Dwan? Do you... Do you know? Okay, like this. Brother Dwan acted weird the whole day. I don't know why. What? I'm married. Sorry. You are married? You came here just to tell me you are married? Okay. You shouldn't got married, Sue. Please. You are not supposed to get married. Okay? Okay. You're supposed to marry me. Okay. Okay. -So why are you here? -I just need the video. -What video? -The video that you emailed to me. Our video! -I didn't send... -Yes you did! -Please, I need the video. -Sue. Oh, Sue. I did sent you an email, okay. That's true. But did it to say that I miss you. I just wanna say I loved you, okay? -I sent you an email... -Please! I'm married. I have a child. I was supposed to be the father of your child. Enough! No. Please stop it! -Please... -I need the video, please. No! Please. Don't leave me, Sue. Sue! I was the one who emailed you, you fool! It was me! -Hairi. -Bi! -Where is everyone? -Bi? Bi! Are you playing a prank on me? Bi! -Hairi! -Bi. Where's the camera? Everyone's gone. Do you get it? Everyone's gone. Bi! Bi! Bi! You know I'm not well. What about me? He's my family. He's more important. I'm so sorry. I've left my family because of you, Sue! Please. Don't leave me. I can't live without you, Sue. -I have to go. I'm so sorry. -Sue. The bride. -Husin. -What? Look, isn't she beautiful? The bride. I've dressed her up and put on make up for her. And I've also tried her. Beautiful! -Hurry up! -Okay! Announcing the arrival of the groom. Come on in. I know you can do this. You can. Destroy evil. Just do it. Just do it. Zul! Bi! Zul! Bi! People say it's better to tie the knot as soon as possible. There was a fool, who was in a relationship for three years. Protecting one another, taking care of her, love her. But in the end, they didn't end up together. Instead, his lover married another man. Isn't it sad? He took care of another man's match for years. That's why people say, you can be in a relationship for a long time. But if you really like her and love her, just get married! Bi! Misha! I've searched the whole house. They are not here! Hairi, I think I know where they are. Okay, where? But I have an uneasy feeling now. Okay, this will do. Show me where they are. Sue. I treasure you more than my own family. I left my family just for a stupid woman like you! -I want to go out! -Mister, please follow me. The road that I chose had taken me to Hell. Do you know that, Sue? Because I was let down by love, I was trapped in a mental hospital. Because I love you so much, Sue. They say I'm depressed. They say I'm insane! They say something's wrong with me! Hey, they didn't know what I've went through! All this while, I hang on to my love for a woman. Because I believed, at that time, my life wouldn't be happy without her. Do you know that I waited for you every single day, Sue? To me, the days were never ending till you appeared in front of my eyes. Zul. -Brother Wan. -Zul. -Brother Wan! -Zul. Zul. -Zul. -Brother, are you all right? -I haven't seen you for a long time. -I'm all right. I forgot I still have my family with me. All this because of you! Because I'm too deeply in love with you, Sue. Nice place, right? Husin! -Here! -My family brought me home. Back to the paradise I once left long ago. You're not insane anymore? I'm okay. I've forgot that all these while, they were always there for me. You're home for good? Great. Let's go. We have a choice in our lives. I used to be the victim. But this time, I have the right to be the predator. There's a pond. I need to get rid of many things. If you want to know all, in our world, there's too much impurity scattered all over the place. And I need to clean it. So what do I do? We kill them. We torture them first. We kill them, we torture them! The more painful, the better. We torture them. We kill them. Then we take videos, Brother. Then, we upload them. We commercialize what we do. We are used to it. We've done this before. I don't want. There are too many bad guys in this world! Immorality! People litter and don't clean up. They throw rubbish everywhere! Who picks them up? I do! Is it really that hard? Is it very troublesome? Troublesome? You know how I did this? It's easy. First, I had to write out this story. I wrote the storyline. Then, I inserted some surprise elements in it to surprise and scare you here and there. Then only I arranged the major characters some weird characters, and I assigned the characters to them. And they are the ones who make this into a great creation! Actually, Sue. You were not a major character in my story. I can kill you at anytime. Do you know why? I know you were just using me. I know, you were in a relationship with me to make me suffer! You wanted me to go insane! You like to see me suffer like this? Sue! You guys are insane. This is it! Yes! Hairi! Hairi! Hurry up! Bro! Husin. -Hurry up! -Let's go. Who locked this? Bro! Hurry up! Let's go! Bro! Bro, relax. Relax, Bro. What's wrong with you? Are you possessed? Bro, it's me! Hey! Who's your brother? I am the clown! Bro, what's wrong with you? Why were you with them? Why did you do this? Why did you kill people? Why, Bro? Why, Bro? Because they are my siblings! The one you killed is my brother! This blood -is my brother's, you fool! -Okay, Bro. Why us? Why did you bring us here? Why did you do this to us, Bro? Because you are an artist! Because Intan is a model! When I have the two of you, the rating of my video increases! Lots of people gonna click on it! -Click! -What's this, Bro? Actually your car is not broken. I'm just bluffing. Then all of you were deceived. Deceived! Don't kill us, Bro! I'm not going to listen to you. -Bro. -Don't talk so much! -I want to kill you! -Please don't, Bro! -Please don't, Bro! -Do you know how to say syahadah? I bear witness that there's no deity but Allah and I bear witness that Muhammad is the messenger of Allah. Bro, please don't! Bro! Let's go! Please. Yes! Yes, Misha! You. Misha! This is for my brothers! BLOCK 404 Brother Wan. Brother. It hurts! Okay. I'll do it! I'll do it. But I want Misha to be in it as well. Sure. I won't allow it. How can she be in it? She's a woman. Three of us is enough. Why want to bring her along? There is too much impurity in our world and my job is to purify it. There are many roles to be played. No matter how far you go, you will still return to a place you'll never be found. The new flow of water will replace the old one. Now, it's time for me to fly. This is your choice, Misha. This is my choice. Stand by. And action! What did you say? Men can never be satisfied with one? My dear, why did you eat? Ask permission first! Hey, what are you doing? Who asked you to eat this? Don't you feel weird that in a thick jungle like this, there's a guest house. Did you hear that? Did you see that? Block 404, it's like someone's been murdered here. Hello guys! Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you. I'm Wan, the manager here. Here, we are with the concept of "back to nature". No coverage, no WiFi, no everything. You are sharing a room with you. No. Don't try to do something funny. We are all not married yet. Do you know that because of you, we are lost? I shouldn't have followed this dumb trip and I shouldn't have known you! Okay, let me show you your rooms. They are all upstairs. Please. Babe. See you later.
