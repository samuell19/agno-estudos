TO JOSE MARIA ELORRIETA The first one to move wins a prize. Come on, get up! On your feet, let's go! Let's go! - Do you think they're cops? - I think it's something worse, man. What will you do with us? Make burgers, kid. Don't you like hamburgers? Are you the doctor? Yes. I'm Sebastian, Don Gonzalo's foreman. Come with me. THE NIGHT OF RAGE Don't look so shocked, doctor. In this village we love to hunt. Yeah. There's our village. Do you like it? Yes. GULLIVER'S TRAVELS "First: the mountain man will not leave our domain without our permission granted by our great seal. Second: the mountain man will not enter our capital without our express consent. And when he does, the inhabitants will be warned two hours in advance not to leave their homes." Look. Don Gonzalo is waiting for you. Don Gonzalo Cruz? Yes? I'm the new doctor... So you're the new doctor. Alejandro Lieman. Lieman. - Tired from the trip? - A little. Well, here's part of the parish. Matias, the priest. - Javier, the mayor. - How do you do? And Enriqueta, the owner of the bar. Can I get you something? Well, of course you can! What will you have? Whiskey? No, not right now. I'm thirsty. Something with orange. Enriqueta, get an orangeade for Doctor... Lieman. Lieman. - Hello, Don Gonzalo. - Afternoon. Hi, how's it going? How was it in the fields, guys? As usual, nothing new in the mountains. In the village, on the other hand, the wind must have changed. Because all of a sudden something stinks. Those wise guys. - Here. - What an elegant doctor. This is the key to your house. We're fixing up a car for you SO you can get around. Let's see how you fix it up, Loren. Like new. Like a fifteen-year-old virgin. You should bleach that tongue of yours. Sebas. What is it, Don Gonzalo? Take the doctor to his house. Well, I'll see you later. - Bye, doctor. - Bye. Lieman. What are you doing with that magazine? It's mine! Let them clean it up. That's what friends are for, right? You don't want to mess with me. You'll find out. Well, who are you? Ana, and you? - Alejandro. - Come in. Thank you. This is the living room. Have you cleaned the house for me? Yes, it was filthy and full of cockroaches. Old stuff always attracts cockroaches. Today I killed 43. Shit. Well, this is very nice. They told me to connect the gas and electricity. The kitchen is over here. Come on. It's all ready to go. How old are you? Guess. Sixteen. - Am I right? - Maybe. - Do you smoke? - Sometimes. For later. Don't you go to school? I wish I didn't have to. They just teach us rubbish. It has nothing to do with what I want to be. And what are you going to be? I'm not telling you. Why not? Because you'll laugh. I don't laugh at such things. An astronaut. Good. I know it's not for girls but I don't care. - It sounds fine to me. - I have to go. Wait. What for? For killing cockroaches. I couldn't do it. - Don't you like hunting? - No. Well, everybody here loves it. Hey, by the way, I saw a black van with a name painted on it. - The Foxhole? - That's it. Does it have to do with hunting? No, it's a clinic not far from here. A clinic? It's my sister. Come meet her. Come on. This is Alex. Marta, the teacher. - How do you do? I'm the new doctor. - Nice to meet you. - I'm glad you're here. - Thank you. - How's the house? - Perfect, thanks to her. We live over there. I'm glad you're my neighbors. If you need anything, just ask. Why don't you come for dinner tomorrow? I like to make friends as soon as possible. I promise I'm a good cook. Say yes, Marta. I don't know. Say yes, Marta. Al right. - See you tomorrow then. - Perfect. If you see more cockroaches, let me know. Astronaut. What's up, Titi? - Oh, that ass! - Do you like it? - Good evening, Don Gonzalo. - Mari, how are you? Been a while since I've seen you around. - What's up, guys? - What's up? You should come see us more often. One day you should loosen up and give me a discount. I spend all my salary in this dump. Well, you know how it is. You either change your salary or your vices. I can't change anymore. You were my first, remember? Do I remember? When there's no one nearby to tell me a joke, I remember. Come on, man. You look like we're at a funeral. I'm tired. Play. You know, this town isn't what it used to be. - So what? - Fuck. My wife's a mess. It's harder for her every day. And for me too. Women are women. How clever! Dear Arantxa, I promised myself not to stir the matter up, but in this town and at this hour, weakness wins out over resignation, and I must admit that you and I have hurt each other. And yet without you, I... That doctor's a fag, just look at him. And how do you know? Because it takes one to know one. Look man, what I have is more than enough to drive your girlfriend crazy. Calm down, dammit! Come on. You're hot, girl. - Come on, bitch! Get up! - Bitch! Let's see that ass! Good morning. - Good morning. - Good morning. Where can I buy food around here? - What do you need? - A bit of everything. I brought a list. I could also use a coffee with milk. What does it say here? Spaghetti, pasta, long noodles. I know what spaghetti is. I just couldn't read your handwriting. The poor woman's a widow. Since she has no man and is no longer young, her manners leak out of her crotch. It's nice to see someone here's in good spirits. Hi, Alex. - How did you sleep? - Fine. Until the shots woke me up. Didn't you hear them? Yes, in autumn, the men go hunting. That early? The best game is to be had early in the morning. At night, doctor, one can only hunt snails. There are a few things missing. I'll get them from the storeroom. Ana, what can I get you? The chicken my sister ordered and some chocolate biscuits. I only have plain biscuits. I ran out of the chocolate ones. Well, I'll take the plain ones then. That shepherd really knows how to do his sheep! No shit. I'm telling you. Here it comes! Man, I wanted to talk to you. What about? The car's out there. Mudo, the keys. Look who's here, our Good Samaritan. How's your sister, babe? What do you care? Careful, Loren, she bites. Do you bite, really? And where? Hey. Are you talking to me? Why don't you quit messing with her? Am I messing with anyone? Am I messing with you? Am I messing with you? That's enough. We're in trouble now. Scarlet Pimpernel's getting pissed. What's going on? Are you trying to provoke me? I don't understand what you're saying, Alejandrito. Careful, Loren, he might hit you with his diploma, or play doctor with you. What have I ever done to you? Nothing. But maybe you want to. Leave him alone. Any problems? Three. You'd better go home and wash up. Come on, Enriqueta, give us something. We're parched. No beer until after mass. Enriqueta, please. I said no beer. Let's go. Nobody wants to drink with chickens. Loren. Fighting doesn't make you more of a man. Doesn't it? Today we'll talk about penance. Penance is a sacrament by which sins committed after baptism are forgiven. Penance is also a virtue by which man accepts his limitations and turns to God. Thus, in the Old Testament, man's penitence is said to be an initial moment of Judgement or the wrath of Yahweh. And by annihilating the destructive evil of Creation, he rebuilds the person and the cosmos on a higher level. Only God can achieve the ultimate victory over sin. Never man. Thus we are told: Thou shalt not take justice into thine own hands. The law of an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth has no place in the bosom of the Church. Let no one believe that the sinner goes unpunished. For after death, the most horrible punishment awaits him. Perpetual deprivation of the sight of God in the afterlife. And now, brethren, let us pray. Stand up. Sebas. Yes? I want to apologize for the other day. I'm sorry. It's no big deal, doctor. It was those punks' fault. Their young hormones make them go wild. Once they get married, they're as tame as lambs. - Want a cigarette? - Thank you. - Nice cigarette case. - Yes. The only one in the world. - Look, my initials. - Is it gold? Pure gold. I got it from Don Gonzalo a few years ago. Is that his wife? Yes. Dona Aurora. She's a nervous wreck. She only leaves her house to go to mass. Poor thing. She hardly speaks or walks. We have to feed her, otherwise she'd die. That's life. Excuse me, I have to take them home. - Bye, Sebas. - Have a good day. Marta. Good morning. Good morning. - You remember dinner, I hope. - Of course. There's not enough to do here to forget plans. Are you going home? - Yes. - I'll walk you home. Hey Luis, don't run! We're going to hunt you down! What do those photos mean? It's a tradition. We bring the photo of our last dead relative to mass. And who was he? My father. A great man. A decent man. Do you see his eyes? The truth of people is in their eyes, don't you think? You can't come in. This is private property. I'm the new doctor and I'm introducing myself to everyone. I thought... Wait a minute. He's the new doctor. He's in a red car. He says he's the new doctor. Let him in. Go ahead. - Good morning, I'm... - Yes, I know who you are. I'm Fabian, manager of The Foxhole. Well, I don't know what The Foxhole is. Not for lack of interest. We're a rehabilitation center for drug addicts. - What? - Drug addicts. - Here? - Yes, here. This is as good as anywhere, right? Yes, of course. It's just that I... - Would you like to see the house? - I'd love to. - How many patients are there right now? - Fourteen. Few, but I assure you they'll be completely cured when they leave. I'm surprised the people of Coto del Valle give money for such a thing. The danger of drugs worries everyone, doctor. Yes, but I didn't think that such a small town would experience this problem so directly. Really? And why the armed guards? Look, I have my methods, and they work. Besides, I'll tell you that my guards aren't there to restrain the sick, but for the wolves. Oh, scary. A pack has been prowling around the village lately. A few days ago, they got into a farmyard and slaughtered everything. They're rabid because they drank contaminated water. Are there factories around here? Upstream. And a nuclear power station has just been installed up north. Progress. We don't like what you call progress here. Can I see some of your patients? Not now, they're resting. Another day perhaps. I have experience with drug addicts and might be of use to you. If we need you, I'll let you know. And now, if you'll excuse me, I have a lot of work to do. Yes, of course. - I'll see you out. - Thank you. Don't worry. It's normal. Abstinence turns them into real beasts. Please. I hope you didn't find me disagreeable. No, of course not. I admire your work. I know all too well what drugs can do. I've had friends who have become a shadow of their former selves. Don't feel too sorry for them. I can't do anything else. Doctor. Goodbye. May 1? What an honor. If it isn't the new doctor! Come in, doctor. Hey, girls, what do you think? That I wouldn't mind a thorough examination. I had no idea there was a place like this in town. People sin everywhere. But people don't like to talk about their sins, of course. Would you like a drink? Something with orange if possible. Something cool? If possible. Help me, please. We live in the asshole of the world. You're exaggerating. You know what I like most about your face? Your eyebrows. Eyebrows tell me a lot about a man. And what do mine tell you? That you mind your own business. You do your thing. - Are you trying to tell me something? - No, poor me. I see, hear, and shut up. A whore's best talent is to be dumb. You're very clever. If one doesn't know how to shut up, she either ends up without clients or dead. - Ana? - Yes, it's me. Hi. - Where have you been? -Am I late? Pretty late. I'll be ready in a minute. You go on ahead. - And give this to Alex for me. - Okay, but hurry up. - I'll do the washing up. - No way. You two can gossip while I make coffee. That girl's bossy. If you only knew. Is she always like that? Yes. So she's at his house? Yes, Don Gonzalo. That doctor's playing with fire. Marta's mine. And we're going to make sure he knows it. Wait for me outside. As you wish, Don Gonzalo. What's the matter? Why are you crying? I need you to sign a check. Here. You're never going to forgive me, are you? It was a few months ago. You don't have to explain if you don't want to. Don't worry, it's not that bad. My wife left home. That's all. Now she lives with one of my old college roommates. Why is that? That's what I've been asking myself all this time. She told me a lot of things I don't even remember. Anyway, I came to a conclusion. - And? She said she was sick of living with a coward. That I was afraid of life, people, work, responsibility. Responsibility. Isn't that ridiculous? And when I started to drink, I proved her right. And why are you telling me all this? Why? Yes, we hardly know each other. I tell you my problems, and if you want to help solve them, well... - What? - Then you care about me. Look, Alejandro, this village isn't good for you. - And neither am I. - Coffee. Coffee. - You don't want me to walk you home? - No, thanks. - Bye, astronaut. - See you tomorrow, Alex. - What have you got there? - Nothing. Just food for the hamsters. Hurry, it's getting very late. Let's go. Ana, go to your room. Okay. What were you doing at the doctor's house? Having dinner, what else would I do? Right. He's very young, isn't he? Don't be ridiculous. As soon as I turn my back, you don't waste any time looking for someone else. He invited us to dinner. I had no choice but to accept. Do you want him to hate us all? Or are you jealous because he's younger than you? Take off your clothes. - In my room. - No, here. - Upstairs. - I said here. Take off your clothes. You're a pig. Sure I am. But take your clothes off. Come on, let's go. One day you'll pay for all this. I don't need to die to know what hell's like. You're a son of a bitch. You're my hell. Hey, kid. I'm here. I brought you food. - I don't need this. - Fuck you. Sorry, girl. I'm sick. I need a fix. - Don't you understand? - That's not my problem. Get me some. I don't care how you do it. Threatening me won't help you. - I'm not coming back tomorrow. - Wait. - You punched me. - I don't like being grabbed. I won't do it again. - Will you be back tomorrow? - Maybe. Well, okay, in the morning. But don't leave unless you want them to find you. Come on, pigs. Fucking junkies. Wash yourselves, you need it. Here they are. Mr. Cruz. We found the jacket near the barn. Tell them. Hey guys, let's go. Hey, kid. Kid. Hey, kid, where are you? I told you. Those suckers don't know who they're messing with. - Good morning. - Where are you going? I told Fabian I would bring these things. What things? - Medicine. - Fabian isn't here. Well, I can't wait. We'll give them to him. They're drugs. He said to give them to him or leave them in his office if he was out. I'm sorry, but that can't be. You'll be more sorry when he finds out. He needs them urgently. All right, leave the car here and go in. But just for a minute. I told you a thousand times to let no one in unless I say so. I didn't give permission! Let's go. Doctor! What the hell are you doing here? This is a prison. I don't give a damn about your opinion. Get off my farm! I want to see the patients. I have a right to examine them. I said get out. Do you understand what you're doing? Do you? Do you understand? What's the matter, doctor? Looks like you've got a flat tire. Good morning. Don't worry, I'm not a ghost. The dead don't worry me. Then what brings you to this place? Prayer and remorse. Priests always give evasive answers, right? Like doctors, I suppose. What's the significance of this gravestone? May 15th, 1978. There was an accident. Men, women, and children died. What happened? That doesn't matter. No. Not anymore. Father, I feel that something very strange has happened or is happening in this village. I don't know what, but it worries me. And what can a poor priest like me do? Talk to Don Gonzalo. I can only pray. Right. Goodbye. IN MEMORY OF THE VICTIMS OF MAY 1978 Marta. Wait a minute, I need your car. Why, what's wrong? With me? With everyone? What's wrong with this town? I don't understand. Can I have the keys? - Where are you going? - Gonzalo Cruz's house. Why? He may be the only one who'll give me an explanation. You seem nervous. I am. Can I have the keys? Did something bad happen? Yeah, you could say that. I had my tires slashed. I was threatened and thrown out of a rehab center that looks like a chamber of horrors. - Calm down. - And that's not all. You can add yesterday's sermon, the photos on the lapels, the gravestone in the cemetery, and a long list of other things. You worry about too much. It's logical that, coming from the city, everything seems strange to you. Besides, you've just gone through a crisis. Right. Of course. You told me so yourself. I know where you're going with this. - Yeah? - You think I'm imagining things. - No, listen. - Or maybe I have delirium tremens. It's disgusting. Where can I make a phone call? There are only two phones in town. One in the bar and one in Don Gonzalo's house. Got it. Leave this town, please. No. And do you know why? As ridiculous as it sounds, I feel that I was born to live this moment. What are you going to do? And you? Ana? Ana, are you there? Anna. Anna. Good afternoon, is Don Gonzalo in? No, he isn't. At the bar they told me he'd be here. He's been out all day, sir. - Do you know when he'll be back? - He doesn't keep a schedule. Most days he doesn't have dinner at home. Tell him the doctor came by and that I need to speak to him. - I'll talk to the lady. - Dona Aurora can't talk. Can I help you with something? Your son? Did he die? In an accident? Was he killed? On May 15, 19787 Can you write? Can you? Tell me what I'm supposed to do with him. We put him in a car and drive him to the city. Shit. I'm sick. My whole body aches and I'm shaking. I don't have what you need. - You're a disease, you know. - Leave him alone. All you know is stealing and killing. For God's sake, Marta, it's not his fault. Don't you remember? Marta! Stay put. Marta! Gonzalo. My God, you're dripping. - Your hands are cold. Come to the fire. - No, leave it. We'll be searching the forest all night. That damn kid escaped. I don't think I can stop by later. Be careful. What are you doing? Your eyes. I see them everywhere. In every stone, in every tree, even when I sleep. Everywhere. You're hurting me. You're all I have. Let go of me, please. I'll never let you walk away from me. Never. Come on, let's go. Come on, man. Marta. We need to talk. You have to tell me everything before it's too late. It's already too late. Can't you see that? Trust me. Take my car and get out of here. For God's sake. I'm not leaving until I find out what's going on in this town. I've been running from things for most of my life. And I can't run forever. And neither can you. Help me, Alex. Help me. I'm here with you. I'm not going to leave you. Do you hear me? - Don't push it man. - What's going on? Come on, dance. Come on. What can I get you? Empty the register. - What? - Empty the register. - What did you say? - Empty the register. - No, help! - Now! Freeze! Nobody move! Shut up, old woman! Get out. Come on. Your watch, pig. Come on! Give it up. Everything, you bastard. Your wallet, come on! Your wallet. You, shut up! I told you to shut up. No! We're being robbed! Robbed! Let's go. Let's get out of here. Come on, run! Don Gonzalo, we caught one! Do you understand now? Yes. I understand that I need you. - No. - I love you. We have to call the police. No. You have to understand. We can't be accomplices to a hunt for human beings. The whole town's in on it. Even me. Don't try to convince me it's not what it looks like. Gonzalo, Fabian, and a few others are running the show. The rest of you just play along. Play along. The Foxhole is open every summer. For years, every 15th of May has been open season. I know. Week after week, a lot of innocent people go down. Drug addicts disappear without anyone reporting them missing. I wish that day they hadn't killed... The romance is over, lovebirds. Come on, let's go! Come on! Out! Pigs! Down on the ground! - Take him away. - No! Come on, get up! Gonzalo, please. It's over. Please! Gonzalo! It's over. Here it comes! Don't complain. You've got company. A rat we found at your girlfriend's house. Give me your arm, bastard. Don't be scared, doctor. You have a good vein. What are you going to do to me? Welcome to the club. Whore! Whore! Whore! I'm taking your sister to The Cebo. If she's half the slut you are, she'll have a career at Dona Ana's. Slut, I'm going to kill you! Whore! Marta, I fled to the forest. I'm fine. Open the door. Anna. Anna. Aren't you buying me breakfast? You're always looking for freebies. You can't refuse anyone a coffee with milk. You have to pay for the service first. What's this, a joke? What do you mean, a joke? I wish I had a lot of jokes like this in the bank. This is the price of a normal fuck, tiger. Don't play dumb. You spent all night in the room. But all we did is sleep. Sleep? You have some nerve. Come on, pay up. No place is going to treat you better than here, you swine. When are you coming back, little pistol? Tonight. The hunt will be early this week. Why's that? It's all that faggot's fault. The doctor. We've locked him in The Foxhole. What? You heard me. Last night he fucked the teacher. Imagine how Don Gonzalo must be feeling. Oh dear! We're letting him out tonight. Him and those left on the farm. It's going to be a great festival. I think you're going too far. My boss knows what he's doing. Yes or no? Well, it's one thing to take out some freaks, but the doctor is too much. You're just interested in sticking your tongue in his, uh, you know what I mean. Hey, tell the girls that we're leaving. Why? Because something bad is going to happen here, and I don't want to see it. In times of danger it's best to act as one. That's what we've done so far. And it's what we'll continue to do. The new doctor helped an inmate escape from The Foxhole. He even tried to flee to the city with him to report us all. He never cared about our motives. From the very beginning he sided with our enemies. Those degenerates who steal and Kill to satisfy their own vice. Don Gonzalo. Excuse me. - What? - Maybe we're wrong. I don't understand. I don't know how to speak like you. But are you sure? Are you sure this is what we should do? What are you trying to say? It's the job of the authorities to straighten these people out. The authorities? No. No. Nobody does anything to stop this scum. The drugs are everywhere, and the cancer is spreading because no one dares to root out the evil. - He's crazy. - Shut up. We can't forget. We mustn't forget that 11 people died in Coto del Valle at the hands of these scum. What do you want here? I want to come in. - This is no place for women. - Why not? You know all too well. It'll be the last one of the year. We'll let all that trash out of The Foxhole. - Don't you understand? - And the doctor? Him too. You've got the hots for him, eh? That's a shame. Now get out of here! Those against the hunt raise your hand. Very well. We'll meet at The Cebo in a couple hours. Al right. Roll the dice! Three kings. - Let's see if you can beat that. - That's easy. I'll show you. Come on, get them all out. It's time for a walk, let's go. No, miss, you can't go in. I'm sorry sir, I told her you were busy. Very well, Lourdes. You can go. What do you want? I have a proposition. Al right. Tell me. But I'm telling you right away, your doctor is non-negotiable. Let's get out of here right now. You and me, tonight. Right. You've asked me a million times. Why not now? Because everything's different now. You slept with that man. And you're in love with him. You're right. But I don't just want to save him. I want to save everyone. You've led the village to a dead end. - Admit it. - So what? After this doctor, there will be another one and then another one. What will you do, kill them all? I don't care about the others. The only one I care about is him. And listen to what I'm about to tell you. Tonight may be the last hunt we ever have in this town. Things may change after this. They may put me in jail or shoot me, but I swear to God, I'll kill your doctor tonight if it's the last thing I do. - You wouldn't. - And why not? Murderer! Here. This is the only way you can stop it. Now I see how much you love me. Fuck, the birds have flown. I'm going to turn on the light. Take it easy, guys. Slowly. There will be hell to pay when we catch them. Sebas, you want a beer? Hey, get me another beer. That damn rain again. - We're not safe here. - There's no other place. When Fabian tells them we escaped, they'll be all over us. That's ugly, man. Ugly. We have to find a place to fight them. Us? No. - We can't. - Listen to me. Those people want to kill us. If you want to survive, find strength wherever you can. Do you understand? There are guns at the farm. He's right. I won't go back to that pigsty. We'll have cover and something to defend ourselves with. - Let's go. - Not you, astronaut. You and the kid try to get a car and go for help. Can you drive? I learned to drive before I learned to read, man. In that case, get going and good luck. Come on. Those motherfuckers got away! A reward for the first one to hit a target. All right, let's go. What's up, Curro? They're heading for The Foxhole. We'll meet on the esplanade. Tell the others. We have to help those people. - It's about time. - I think we should leave. - We made our presence known. - He's right. - With the commotion, who'll notice? - We have to go. - We can still do something for them. - Like what? I don't know, but we have to go. There they are. Come on, get down! Madam! Dofa Aurora! Madam! Where are you going, madam? Madam! Ana, what are you doing here? Your car keys. My car keys? Why? Who's that? Father, I'm a Christian, but if you don't give us the keys I'll blow your head off. Come on, throw them over here. You two cover the kitchen. Go! Come on, upstairs. You guys, watch out. You, over here. You, with me. Watch out, Mr. Cruz. There are guns in there. How many? Three or four, maybe five. Then we shouldn't give them time to get organized. Listen to me. We have to empty the magazines on the house. So let's go. Let's go. Now! Get back! Take cover! Don't kill me, please. I didn't want to kill anyone. Don Gonzalo forced me, understand? Take it easy. Bitch! Let's go. Where are you going? Don't move! Get down! Don't scream, girl. Don't worry, nothing will happen to you. Motherfuckers. That's it, calm down. You're going to like this. - Don't touch me! - Don't move. Don't touch me! - Don't move bitch! - Don't touch me! Loren. Curro. Curro Over there, that's the village. Loren! Loren! Motherfuckers. Let's go. We have to finish them off once and for all. What's the matter with you? Are you afraid? They can't take us all on. I'll lead the group myself. Let's go. What are you doing here? Have you gone mad? This is no place for women, especially for an invalid. Go away! Can't you see you're making a fool of yourself? Go! Crazy old woman! Freeze! Freeze, Fabian. What's this about? You're just as responsible as I am. If we don't go in and kill those people, we'll all end up in jail. I'm no more guilty than you are. - We won't stop you. - What? The house is all yours. Go ahead. You're all as guilty as I am. You all took part in the hunts, cowards. You're all cowards.
