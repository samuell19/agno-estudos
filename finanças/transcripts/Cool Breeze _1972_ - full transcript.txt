Oh, just sweeping here, Uncle Tom, just sweeping. Frisk him. Watch your hands, man. I'm ticklish. No gun, no money, no nothing. - You're brothers, right? - Half brothers. That's right same nig different jockey. Shut up, Travis. Search the place, Harry. You got a warrant officer? John, don't make it hard on yourself. I got a business here. You see all these people looking at you? What're they gonna think, huh? You disrupting my business without a warrant. Alright, Travis, let's go now. You gonna finish sweeping? [male #1] 'Andrews, let's get it on.' Smith Alteridge, step forward. Age 55, no record or prior arrest. - Put your hands down, Smith. - I'm dangerous-- Shut up. Don't rile a lieutenant. Mr. Smith, will you put your hands down? Please. Thank you, Mr. Smith. Andrews, what in the hell is he doing here? He was arrested at eight last night, sir. Phoned in hisself. Said he murdered Miss Ann. Miss Ann? Miss Ann, who? Well, that's all lieutenant. A Miss Ann. Said she was his main squeeze. Next, Andrews. Step back. [Andrews] 'George William, step forward.' 'Put your hands down.' Age 22, possession of narcotics. Occupation, clerk. Picked up downtown talking to himself. - Claims he's Jesus. - Uh, who? Jesus, you better handle this one careful, lieutenant. You could be another Pontius Pilate. Ha ha. Next, Andrews. Step back. [Andrews] 'Battle Travis, step forward.' 'Occupation none. Age 27.' He was with football jive, served in Vietnam. Honorable discharge. [Andrews] 'Released from the club due to a war injury.' 'Regular hero, lieutenant.' '1969, arrested for loitering. No disposition.' 1970, suspicion of narcotics traffic. Insufficient evidence. '1971, suspicion of armed robbery, no disposition.' '1972, suspicion of assault and robbery. Acquitted.' We're damn sure he's been a lot busier than that. Andrews, come here. Yes, sir. Is this the best you can do for a line up? Well, that's it, sir. You know what you got up there? You got two jive nuts and a lucky crook. - Get a coat and get up there. - Me, sir? - Now! - Yes, sir. Everett, bring in that clerk from the hotel. Yes, sir. Lieutenant Knowles. You Mr. Davidson, right? From the Hotel Douglas. - Yes, sir. - Good. Okay, now do you see the man that robbed you last night? Not down here. Up there. [Davidson] 'I don't know.' [Knowles] 'You don't know?' [Davidson] 'Yes, I know. It's that all look alike.' You know what they say about us niggas. [all laughing] Mr. Davidson, do I look like you? Take a good look now. No, sir. Then they lied to us, didn't they? - We don't all look alike. - No, sir. - Captain Harmon-- - What? The message just says he wants to see you now. Andrews. Look at them. Andrews, I want you to take Mr. Davidson here downstairs and look at all the black mug shots we have in the building. I don't care if it takes all night 'and then maybe we won't all look alike.' Sit down, Knowles. - Alright, what is it? - Sir? 'What the hell is going on in your division?' 'There've been 39 auto thefts' '33 burglaries, 18 armed robberies' 'seven assaults, two race riots and five moral offenses' 'all in the last month.' Since more Negros are in this division the muggings and stick ups have gone up 20 percent. That's a lot of crap, sir. They've increased in every other division in the city. That don't make it any better from where you stand now, does it? The only safe merchants around here are the black ones who keep their places open as fronts for the bookie joints. I closed them down. 'But they open up again, don't they?' 'That because you don't close 'em down hard enough.' 'I want you to tear out the phones, break the furniture!' Bust 'em! 'You recognize him?' You'd have to be white not to recognize him. Sidney Lord Jones. What about him? He's in San Quentin. Was, Knowles. Was. Somebody greased that fruit cake parole board and now he's out a lot sooner than anybody thought possible. A lot of money was spent and investors want interest. I wanna know the kind of interest he's gonna pay off. 'He's in LA, I want you to find him.' 'I wanna know every move he makes' 'every time he spends a dime to take a crap.' [upbeat music] - Hey. - Where're you going, man? What are you? The man or something? Look more like a yellow pages nigga. Sure a funny looking nigga, alright. What you got in that bag? Come on, let me see. - Can I trust you? - Him. - Sure, man. You can trust me. - You can trust him. You ain't going in there anyhow. Don't try to talk, brother. You just listen. In minute you'll feel better. You get up and you go tell Mr. Finian "Sidney Lord Jones is here to see ya." And don't rub 'em, you'll just make it worse. [indistinct chattering] [telephones ringing] Some bastard fixed this rate. I knew I shouldn't have taken it. Too much money on some no count nag. You find out what white bastard is fixing his rates. - It could've been lucky.-- - Make me lucky. That's why I got you for. Jesus, lover of my soul Stretch, some super space dude out there wants to rap with you. You're in trouble or in a lot of luck. Quit rubbing you balls. Who is he, what's he want? He looks like he could be the man. But he says his name is Sidney Lord Jones. - Davis, send him in. - I'm in. Ha ha ha! I was waiting to see you! Dear God.. Man, they told me you was out. Hey, man. How you doing? I say, "Lord show me how to commit the perfect crime" and here you is right here in my place. - The Lord. - Yes, I wanna see Mercer. Hold on, Lord. Show me how to commit the perfect crime. This store ain't all I got going. I need $50,000 from you. In a whole over three million into. Big enough so three million look like a pimple on a broads ass. Something wrong, Mr. Finian? Holy moly. Nobody else talked to me about that kind of dough before. $50,000? I don't know man. White boys pull that kind of shit. Shove it! You playin' yourself cheap. Brothers got a thing bigger than that. Lot of dough man that's Whitey's kind a job-- Whitey's job? Whitey is busy worrying when China's gonna drop the bomb. I'm gonna get over. Are you ready for me or not? I'm ready for you. I sure hope she gets old. Dear God, make Mr. Finian give up the booze. Oh, no, just one or two a day. [knock on door] Oh, it's you. - What do you want? - I wanna make a bet. - Well. - Davis says you gotta okay it. - How much you in for? - About $2300. Learn how to win, then come back. Stretch, I need this bet to get ahead, man. Okay. Okay. Tell Davis your bet's good for 500 more, but that's it. 'You better pick a winner and start paying me back.' If you can't, go learn yourself a trade. Look, don't loud talk me like that. I'll kick you so hard in your ass it'll make your nose bleed. What's wrong with you, man? I want my money. I put enough here to buy it three times over. - Haven't I always paid you? - Ain't nobody said you didn't. You're trying to make me out like a jive deadbeat. - Oh, Travis, all I said-- - I don't want no favors. You'll get your money tomorrow. Son of a bitch. I let this clown have my bread. He gets uptight 'cause I bring it up. Who is he? Oh, he's just another loser around here bettin' on an angel. My book whips the shit out, and he keeps comin' back. Supposed to be some hip dude pushing his muscle around town. Where were we? I see Mercer. Well, I don't know. Fifty thousand dollars.. - Give me a couple of days - Tomorrow. Early. Mercer ain't never been in anything like this before. He's got the money to invest. You just set it up. Sorry we're closed.. 'Lock that door.' Well, what'd they jack you up for this time? Same old bullshit. Took me downtown and put me in a lineup. Some hotel clerk couldn't identify shit. - Was it you who hit the hotel? - What hotel, man? I'm walkin' and the man starts chasin'. All I need with my record, to get caught with a gun. Wish I did pull that job. Some dude got away with a whole bunch of money. Knock off for a while, Travis, or they're gonna nail your ass. The pigs go for blood. Keep it up, you'll end up with your ass in the slam. When I need somethin', I go out and get it. And right now I need me $2300. - Finian? - Yeah. Let him sweat. Will do him good. That fat ass dog. He can afford to lose a few pounds. A weasel ass like him. He's badmouthing me. Getting people to think I'm his bad bet. What do you care about that loser. Might be a blessin' if you can't find a book to give you credit. I didn't come here to hear that. Then hear this. You ain't getting a dime. I ain't got 23 cents to give you. Who gave you the money to buy this place? And I paid you. Ten times over. You've been nickel and diming me to death. I ain't gonna let you take me down drownin' with you. Brother or no brother I need the money. - Hey, now look-- - Get out of my way. Hey, I'm your brother. Just because my old man poked your lady don't make you special. Now, stay out of my way. You alright, man? I've felt better. - Hey, man, I'm sorry. - Yeah. Look.. ...here's half of what you need, huh. Since we're only half brothers. You give Finian what you owe him.. ...and you keep the rest for yourself. Go on. Take it before I change my mind. I'll try to get the rest of it to you tomorrow, okay? I'll see Roy. - Still messin' with that dude? - Yeah, some. Once in a while. Dudes downtown get hung up for a good driver on somebody's job so Roy calls me. Yeah, just be careful, huh? Heh. Look who's talkin'. Hey, did you read the paper today? No. The fuzz busted 38 massage parlors. Boy comes and bumps you. Yeah, Obalese, she works in one of them joints, don't she? That dumb broad. She always got her hands where they don't belong. [baby crying] I've gotta feed the baby, Roy. Just keep it up. Just keep it up. I'm not going nowhere. [shushing] What is it? What is it? Hmm. [baby crying] There you go. Ain't that pretty? - 'Put her down..' - Okay. Yes. Okay. Go to sleep. There's a good girl. - Here I am, lover. - Oh. [phone ringing] Oh, yes. Hell with that telephone. [phone ringing] Oh, fuck. Yeah. John, what the hell you calling me this time of night for? What? You call me at 2 o'clock in the morning because you wanna borrow $1800? It's going down. If I had you here right now I'd kick your ass. It's dying. Hey, man, I haven't pulled a job in at least three months. I got a family to support and if I was gonna go downtown and burrow any money, I'd do it for myself. Going. Hey man, I don't have to listen to that crap. Going, gone. God! That bitch. Tryin' to make me feel cheap 'cause I wouldn't go downtown and borrow $1800 for him to give to a loser like Travis. And you should have heard what he called me. I'm suppose to be his friend too. Come to me, lover. Oh, shit. Oh, it's just not happenin', Roy. Goddamn worthless thing. [dialing] Yeah, John, I'm sure I can get it for you. Yeah, I'll have it there before noon. Okay.

Oh, not you this time, huh, baby? - Hmm. - Come on, get away. Hey, what did I do? I mean, just what did I do? Travis. Travis, I'm for you, baby. All the cats on the street diggin' me and I'm just trying.. Sure, baby, sure. I don't like being alone. I'd be good to you. - Do anything you want. - Look you and I know better. What's the matter with you anyway? - I just wanna be with you. - Come here. I'm hustlin' tryin' to get out of the city and you try and hustle to get to me. Baby, you're crowding me. I got plans. I can't get it on in mighty's jungle. When I get it together my way I'm goin' back home. To clean air and open spaces and doin' my thing. Baby! - Whoa! - Anything like that. Yeah, but can I stay, huh? - I'll be good to you. - Yeah, I bet you could. - Make you feel good. - Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm. Now, don't go funning me. Just a couple of days, huh? Okay. But don't go gettin' no ideas. - Okay? - Mmm-hmm. Ow! [seagulls screaming] Thank you. They ain't got nothin' in this town worth million dollars [Sidney] 'There's diamonds.'

[John grumbling] What are you doin' out there? Collecting fares? Come on. Let's get it going. Now, listen. I want you acting human. I don't want anybody killed. Brush it away but not bumped. Gee, I hope I'm in the right place. [music continues] [music continues] [Sidney] Travis, I told you, you're no trouble. You see to it we don't have any. Watch the back door. [music continues] [music continues] [explosion] Get it on. We ain't shootin' targets in Atlantic City. Hey, man, I gotta focus it first. Ain't gonna see the beam anyway. [music continues] [buzzing] Alright. Now, it's shittin'. [buzzing continues] [music continues] [crashing] Here. Start collectin' the rocks. I'll check it. [Travis] Hmm, I wonder if I can get my name engraved on this. Sounds a little rustic to me. [Roy] 'Travis, who do you think you are? Sidney Poitier?' That camera thing ain't makin' no screen test. Wearin' a mask don't mean it's Halloween. 'No trick or treatin'. Come on, move your ass outta there.' [Travis] I'm comin', Roy. I'm comin'. [gunshot] [alarm ringing] - Come on, we gotta get out. - Don't wet your pants. You're supposed to be watching the back door, aren't you? Hey, man, Rent-A-Cop. [gunshots] Travis, Travis. It's okay. Come on, let's get outta here. Roy. Roy. [alarm continues ringing] [siren wailing] [tires screeching] [cop #1] Get that bus outta here. [dramatic music] [Roy groaning] Take me, Lord. Take me home. I got it in the side. I can feel it goin' up. I'll get you to a doctor. No, no, man. Take me home. [knock on door] Come right in, boys. Right in. Now, how'd everything go? - You're Renner? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. This is Tinker James, my business partner. Mr. James. What's he doin' here? My business partner. Okay. - Can we see the stuff? - It's all here. - This is good. - Better be. The store don't give refunds. You don't have to read paper to find out what's in it. What's in it is here. I'm sure we're gonna do much better than we-- Sure, but let's see the color of your cash. You did one hell of a job. One hell of a job. 'Course you understand that yesterday was Sunday. Hmm, and today is Monday. Now cut the shit. Well, I haven't got the money quite yet. - 'You haven't got it?' - I haven't got it now. But I will get it. Wednesday morning. Maybe tomorrow. Now, you boys have to understand people sticking their necks out with a million bucks in cash ain't ready to part with it easy. They'd be getting a little too quick. We moved on you. Wait a minute, man, I'm Bill Mercer. Now you know I'm good. Give me a few days. Few more days? The cops ain't gonna be boppin' around waitin' for few more days. They're warmin' for us now. We gotta remain flexible. We gotta be flexible. Trust me, but if you don't-- You want me to leave the stuff with you? - Nobody's knockin' my door. - Fuck off, man. I'd let the clam decorate the cross 'than leave 'em with you.' - Hold it. Tinker here. - Tinker, what are you doin'? Shut up, Bill. 'Talk ain't gettin' us nowhere.' - Now, toss it over here. - You're bad man, Mercer. And you, get your hands up. Get 'em up. - Nervous, Travis? - A little bit. You'll be nervous and alone if you don't toss that over here. 'Now, toss that over here.' [gunshot] [glass clinking] [gunshots] [panting] Get up. I said get up. This bullet might not kill you but you'll remember it the rest of your damn life. [mumbling] It's a cold shot, man. Tryin' to hog it all for yourself. Where's your head at? You could've been somebody. Come on, man, now, please. Now, please. I'm sorry, man. Look, I'm broke. I ain't got credit in the dime store. Oh, man, please. Give me a break, man. Lord, let me give him the cure.. Don't get your bows in an uproar now. Mr. Mercer here has messed things up. And Mr. Mercer is gonna straighten things out. - Man, I can't do nothin'! - Oh, sure. Sure you can. [laughing] See, we are the sticker. And the insurance company is stuck! So you're gonna go to the insurance company. - Insurance company? - Sure. This heist has set 'em back quite a few bucks. So we're just gonna offer them their beads back for 'em easily 25% of what they're worth. They might buy it. No questions asked. Yeah, well.. Yeah, I guess I could try. I-- [chuckling] You ain't got no choice. Well, after all you and Tinker were partners. Hmm? You could be lyin' that way. Still partners. [John] Mercia! Dammit. Where's that woman? Marcia! Get your ass up. Marcia! Marcia. Marcia! Nip it. The baby's sleepin'. [Roy groaning] - 'Easy, boy. Easy, boy.' - 'I'm dyin'.' John, what's happened? Let me lay him down before you start in on me. - No! - Dammit. Ain't nobody leaving you, my dear boy. Why can't we take him to a hospital? Call an ambulance. - Do something. - Finian has send in for a doc. If we take him to the hospital, they'll use him for spare parts. [Roy groaning] [crying] You've always been trouble. Blame me? Shit. Ain't my fault. It was a fight-- Roy don't fight. You know that. [siren blaring] Listen to that. Yeah. Must be a fire or somethin'. [Roy groaning] John, John. I pray to god that doctor gets here quick. [yawning] Did you ever see such hard flab? Ain't I deserving to have somethin' to go right. Why did it all go wrong? Sweet mother of God, why did it all go wrong? Shut up. You want to complain? Go, put your head in the toilet. Travis, you want Finian to call you a doctor? You worry me gettin' whiter all the time like that. Give me a drink. That'd hurry my tan. Pour Travis a drink, Finian. Christ will save you. Yeah. Well, who's gonna' save me the 50 grand I'm out? Jesus Christ! Why I get caught up in these messes? [phone ringing] Maybe that's the Lord callin' you out, Finnie. Yeah. Probably collect. 'Hello. Yeah. ' 'It's John. Yeah.' He wants to talk to you, Travis. Yeah, go ahead. Yeah, I'm okay. 'Who the hell you wanna talk to?' Alright. Lord, it's for you. Lord here. [siren ringing] Looks like box springs and stained sheets tonight, man. My business is here. Stay loose. Well, cops are starting to twist arm. Bustin' folks who don't show. They're lookin' for anybody and everybody. John, they just got. [guitar music] [indistinct chatter] They got me down here on a false charge. - You know what happened to me? - Hey, you wanna listen to me? Hey, you better listen, I mean what you gonna do about this? Get your ass off my paper. I ain't moving till you take down my complaint. - Look, I wanna see the captain. - Man, we'll call you. Rustlin' me outta my bed, embarrassing me in front of my.. What are you gonna do about my bus? We'll call you when we're ready. I ain't like one of them hustlers you know, who got someone every hour. I'm particular. - Vivian. - Hey, you, you. You, cool it. I'll be with you in a minute. Hey, hey that's not you, Captain.. - I said cool it. - Now, where's my-my bus? Get your ass in there and shut up. Vivian, the sooner you settle it down and answer a few questions the sooner you can get it out in the streets again. Now, all I wanna know from you is you seen this man? All I ever see is the ceilin', baby. Now, you sure you haven't seen this man? You got a picture of him from his waist down? No. I ain't never seen him. Now, you through? Yeah, yeah, and the only reason I'm being generous to you and lettin' your ass sit on my desk is I might wanna use your services someday. Over my dead body. I might like it that way. Now, out. Out! Maybe we're barkin' up the wrong tree, lieutenant Nah. This job has got his name written all over. 'Obalese Eaton.' Have you ever seen this man at any time in the last 10 days? I don't think I've ever seen him before. You don't think? Take a good look. 'Did you or didn't you?' - No. - 'No, what?' No, I don't think I've ever seen him before. [Bill] Boys, you got to understand. I've got a name in the community. And that's why these men came to me with this offer. And another thing I want you to understand. I don't be fooling around with no stolen goods. [male #1] I'm sure, but what makes you think it's a legitimate offer? [Bill] Well, judging from the way they sounded on the telephone based on my own experience I'd definitely say that the offer was real. But you see, it's up to you fellas. Well.. ...what am I supposed to tell 'em when they call back? [male #2] I'm not excited about it, Bray. We're making it easy for them. There's always a possibility the police department will come up with something. Maybe they'll take less than 25 percent. [Bill laughing] [coughing] I think we just soon flush it down the toilet than haggle with you. - On principle, I'm against it. - Who knew? Three million dollars is a lot of money to lose on some measly principle. And besides, you all know you can buy a principle pretty cheap nowadays. Thank you, Mr. Mercer. This isn't something we can decide for ourselves. We'll have to consult others in the firm. Well, I could appreciate and understand your position. Oh, by the way just consider me like well, the Lone Ranger in this kinda deal. Kemosabe. [laughing] You maybe a sharp ass businessman but you sure ain't no pool shot, honey. If you play fair and have your feet on the floor, I'd win. Funny man. Funny man. There's a couple of cops out here to see you, Mr. Mercer. If the flatfeet ain't got no warrant, throw 'em out. You into anything, Bill? Barry, tell 'em I'll be right there. 'Oh, but, honey we were having so much fun.' You can see 'em later. Oh, bastard. - Mr. Mercer? - Yeah? I'm Lt. Holster. This is officer Matten. What's your problem, boys? - Do you know a Tinker James? - Yeah. When was the last time you saw him? - 'Oh, yesterday sometime.' - Yesterday? 'Yesterday afternoon. Is he in some kinda trouble?' 'Not anymore, he isn't.' 'We fished his body out of the ocean this morning.' Jesus! Well, I didn't know he could swim. Not pumped through like a sieve, he can't. - We found this on his body. - What is it? It's a list of names on your business stationary. - Know any of 'em? - Oh, just a bunch of deadbeat. Tinker was collecting some debts from me. That's all. - Was he using muscle? - Why's that my business? If he was, I ain't got nothin' to do with it. I see. When did you say you saw him last? I told you. Yesterday afternoon. The coroner puts his death at 1 or 2 this morning after the Von Keep job. We figure there might be some connection. One was shot. There was blood on the floor. 'Maybe it was Tinker's. Maybe he died in the getaway car.' 'And they tossed his body in the ocean.' Lieutenant, Tinker was nickels and dimes. If you ask me, I think it was some heavy white dudes. One more thing, Mr. Mercer. Just for the record, where were you last night?. - I could, but I'd rather not. - I rather you would. Well, I'm nearly 60, but I'm living much younger than that. - 'You understand?' - Go on. [Bill] 'Well, uh, I was out with a young lady last night.' [Holster] 'Uh-huh.' Well, her name is Lark Williams. - 'Uh-huh.' - And she lives at the beach. Now, I got there by 11:30. And I stayed a little longer than I planned. - Uh, you understand. Don't you? - Yes, sir. We understand. Thank you, sir. Hello, Lark. No, maybe tomorrow. Now listen to me very carefully, baby. You might get a knock from the police. Quiet down. Quiet down. No, I ain't in no kinda trouble. But if they ask you about last night you tell them that I spent most of the night with you. What? There is? Oh, well, it's, uh, just 'em sauce on the rug and you clean it up real good, huh? [tires screeching] I hate driving this big bat, huh? [honking] [siren blaring] [tires screeching] [siren blaring] [Lord] 'Pull over nice.' Remember. They all think we look alike. So act like it. [siren blaring] [indistinct chatter on radio] Let me see your driver's license? You know you went through a stop sign back there? Yes, sir. [indistinct chatter on radio] Run a make.. [tires screeching] [glass shattering] Who's left? You talked to nearly all the sickles in town. You've been gettin' thousands of phone calls from all over the state. Man, this Lord Jones, sure gets around. Look, I am a citizen. Now, why can't I see the captain? Man, you're still here. I am responsible for a $4200 conveyance. Now, you wouldn't understand about that, huh? Look, man, you can't have people goin' around stealin' 42 grand. That's what them buses cost. And I am responsible. That's what this is all about? I mean, knockin' me in my head, stealin' my bus-- Now, you just go sit there and I'll take the report. [instrumental music] [panting] [bell buzzing] Ah. Why can't this happen to me at home? [snapping fingers] Uh, excuse me, honey. I gotta go get some more oil. Shh. Don't start panicking. Just listen. Get rid of him and I'll be in the shower room. - I've scared for you-- - Just get rid of him. [water gurgling] You plan and you plan, you don't cut corners and they don't matter. 'I'd had done better drawing straws.' Fuck, man. It can't be dumb luck. [sighing] Tackle the Rent-A-Cop. The dumb shell dumps the deacon. 'Geronimo and Tinker, smashing into squad cars and..' Oh, Travis, baby. I was so worried about you. Cops been running down everybody. - Oh, Travis, you're hurt. - Forget it. We need to hide here. But cops been askin' everybody 'bout him. They want him bad. Forget him. Can we stay here 'til tomorrow night? What is wrong with you, Travis? What you got against stayin' alive? I can't stand pain and you give me one in the ass. Now can we stay here? Yes or no? Yeah, Travis. We close tomorrow. Alright. Uh, like what happened? Uh, she confirmed what Mercer said. That he was with her from 11:30 to 3:00. Yeah. Did you believe it? I don't know. Mercer doesn't have enough stamina to stay with her more than half an hour. I didn't send you over there to determine Mercer's virility. 'Was she telling you the truth?' I guess so. If he wasn't, he's crazy. Jeez, an old nigger like that. You know, I can tolerate a little masturbation. I can even tolerate some sodomy. Let him cavort with a cow. But an old man like that with a nice, pretty young girl. That's too much. That's too much like incest. 'You know, she could be his daughter for all I know.' I gotta guy out here, I think you oughta listen to. - About what? - The Von keep business. Alright. Alright, bring him in. Holster, that's all. I'll see you later. Yeah. Oh, and Holster, you watch out for that, that...pervert. Sit down. 'Alright, what do you got to tell us?' Now, not everybody wants to listen, huh. I mean, I've been sittin' here for eight goddamn hours waitin' for ears to listen Okay. Now, I'm Charles Waynewright Washington. I mean, Charles Washington Waynewright. You see, I've told you I was in this place too long. Now, I'm a bus driver, you see. My number is 6362RTD. - Now, I-- - Charlie. Tell him about the man on the bus. Alright. What did they look like? I'm tied up lying in the back of the bus. I mean, they got me scrunched up against the wall. Alright, alright. Tell him what you heard, Charlie? The point is, I am a city employee. I've got responsibility. 'Now, look, they didn't take nothin' 'but they used up some little gas' 'they made a little dent on the left side.' I mean, that bus costs forty-two thousand dollars! I mean, that's city property. That's city money. You know, you oughta do somethin' about those guys and find them and put them away. They're just regular nuts. Just tell the captain what you heard, Charlie. Now you wanna know what did they say? Nothin'. Then I hear one of them say, "Don't call me The Lord. Call me Dicky baby." Nuts. Regular nuts. They used the bus for a getaway? 'What else? What other names did you hear? Uh. There was a Wallace. Then there was a-a Georgie baby. Then they mentioned a guy named...Finian. Finian. Finian, Finian, Finian.. That's the name of the book over Nose division. Right, sir. Hello? Hello, look.. Hello? Connection.. Hello, Nose? Nose, call me back. This connection's lousy. Right. Hello, hello, get me someone there run down everybody's first and last names that sounds like Wallace, Dicky, Georgie. Right away. Yeah [phone buzzing] Hello, Nose? Nose? Listen, you lean on your boy Finian and find out about Sidney Lord Jones. And his Von keep business. You hear me? Right away. And you better not come back empty handed or you'll be sweepin' here for the rest of your life. We got a positive ID on Lord Jones in the Broadway area. He's got Travis Battle with him. Battle backed into a squad car. 'and busted that pretty good.' [laughing] Oh, he's bustin' loose all around us. Hey, listen, surround that area. The whole thing. [whispering] Only quiet. Real quiet, mate. Hey, what about me, huh? You, you? Get outta here. Get him outta here. Well, what about my.. They kidnapped my-- We are, we're so.. Listen, we crack this one maybe we get a promotion? We can be mayors. Who knows? Travis, I don't know nothin' about this. You better get a doctor. You haven't slept all night. Just pack me up tight. Here. Here's a grand. Go, get me a car. Okay. [coughing] Well, we're the last ones. I don't know what you're sayin' about luck and not hiding. Yeah. We will get out. L.A. is too big a town. Yeah. I'm gonna be headed to Chicago. Do you wanna come? L.A., Chicago, Detroit, is just another place to die. I'm going where whitey ain't paved all the roads yet. Listen, man, I, uh, I hate to ask you, you know. I haven't given you a deal but I need some dollars. I've only few hundreds left-- - Sure. - Say, two grands. You take a piece of glitters, huh? Here, say somethin' like this. Hmmm [chuckling] It's worth it. Keep them. Oh, come on. Take it. Sit down for a couple of years and cool off. I need my gun. Tryin' to battle Mrs. Harris can be trouble. 'Still thinkin' like a poor boy, huh?' Alright, man. Where you gonna be? Forget it. You know better. I hope that you'd stay in this town. 'Bein' black and no protection against..' [chuckling] Remember.. ...you're a winner until you get caught. [dramatic music] - You're free? - Yeah. Get in. Well, where to? Drive me North, up the coast to San Luis Obispo. Hey, that's a lot of miles. This ain't no joke. I gotta a television show to do up there. You know, I thought I recognized you. Freeway is faster. 'Take the coast that way.' Oh, you just like waves, huh? 'You ain't gonna see them in the dark.' I like the dark. Got plenty of time. Finian! I swear to God, I had nothing to do with that business. And you know I'm a religious man. O-oh! Finian, Finian, Finian, Finian! Sucker, you got about as much religion in you as a dollar-come-by. 'Finian, why don't you tell me about it?' Sure, you saw Lord Jones here. I didn't see anybody here. I didn't see nothin'. Then why connect me with Von Keep? Simple. Captain knows somethin' about you. 'And I'm down here to find out what.' Finian, Finian, do you think I get jollies by tearin' this place up like this, huh? Please, believe. He just comin' here to buy a suit. That's all. You wear our clothes too. Don't you? Well, he's just wears it, too. [indistinct] I'm your friend. Don't you.. Mm-hmm. I don't remember nothin'. Now, Finian.. Finian! Finian, why don't you do yourself a favor. I'll make a deal with you. You turn states.. ...tell me all about it, and what I'll do is I-I'll make sure, I'll make absolutely sure that you won't get more than a year. Two, at the most. Hmm? Huh? Jesus! Ah, that hurt. [crying] Give me a chance, will you? Tell them you couldn't find anything. Yeah, that's it. I-I'm out of town. But you're here, here. Finian, the captain is out for blood. Hmm? And you know damn well it ain't gonna matter. Jesus! Don't harass me. [indistinct] You better watch out. Finian, I bet you would narrow me, would you? That's right. But I'll tell, tell, I'll tell about all that you've been gettin' out of me. I wish you hadn't said that, Finian. 'Cause now you have pissed me off. Oh! Jesus! You crazy! What's wrong.. [panting] [Finian screaming] Sucker.. [indistinct] Huh, up until now. But now, I'm going to be a good cop. 'Cause if I let you go, I'll be a bad cop. [Finian groaning] You just aren't happy. I will expect you make me work on it. [panting] Look, I'm sorry. I'm your friend. Don't move. Dammit, don't make me.. That'll kill me. Don't make me. [train horn blaring] [coughing] [siren blaring] Hurry, take the back. You're up here with me. [humming] Hey, turn around real slow. - Where's Roy Harris? - He's in there. Hey, what's the problem here? He's wanted for robbery. That can't be. Harris is dead. How'd he die? He had an illness. - How was he taken by? - He got shot. That Von Keep robbery. No. Street fightin'. 'His thing was breakin' up street fights.' - Street fight, huh? - Yes. Bishop's comin' tomorrow. It's in the papers. The mayor is comin'. Even the Police Commissioner will be here to honor him. The Police Commissioner? [instrumental music] [door opens] I got to see a doctor right away. Have a seat, please, and fill up this form. An accident. My husband has had an accident. He's fainted, and he's in the car, and he's bleedin'. You oughta go to a hospital. Dr. Fields is a gynecologist. Ma'am, hold it. Ma'am, you can't. 'He's got a patient.' Will this be alright? 'Oh, what is this?' My-my husband's had an accident. He's hurt and he's bleeding and he's fainted. And he's in the car. Excuse me, please. I'm sorry. Let me see what this is all about. [engine revving] [groaning] [coughing] Sit down here. Lie back. He's been hemorrhaging. He's lost a lot of blood. Hold this. Hold it. Thank you. Um, I've got to get some more bandages. Now hold that bottle up high. Hello, sheriff? This is Dr. Fields. Fields. Some colored woman has just brought her husband into my office. He's got a bad wound. Looks like a gun shot. Hang up. Out. Get him up. I want him in the car. He's lost lot of blood. He should be in a hospital. You should've been callin' a hospital when you was callin' the damn cops? 'Hey, you. Get that bottle.' But that's wrapped. 'Come on.' Now help him. Come on, help him. [instrumental music] [chuckling] That's good. - 'This one?' - Yeah. You see, honey. Five minutes of this treatment and all your troubles disappear. Ten minutes and your fingers will be just like another erogenous zone. Did that mean that we'll be making love in half hour? Cheeky, honey. You're so over sex. Look, your fingers has goosebumps on 'em. No. [doorbell ringing] Who could that be? It's late already. Edna, wait, wait. Now, wait a minute. - Do you love me? - Of course, silly. I wouldn't be massaging your fingers if I didn't. Why do you love me? Damn it, because you're nice and do favors. [instrumental music] [doorbell ringing] God, it's late boys. - 'Never too late for business.' - 'Can we come in?' - Uh, no. - 'Yeah.' Hands on the table. Feet apart. - What the hell is this? - You're under arrest. You have the right to remain silent, Mercer. Anything you say maybe taken down and used against you as evidence. - I've heard that on TV before. - Inside. Now, what the hell is this all about? You are charged of complacently, robbery and murder. Find the girl. And come on, let me tell you something, lieutenant. My lawyers are fanatic about suin' for false arrest. If you think you're gonna make those charges tick you better get yourself a good crooked judge and a rigged jury. How about a nice honest confession? Your friend, Finian, had a lot to say. Here. Why don't you read it? [woman crying] 'Hey, come on out of there.' 'Come on out of there.' I'm not gonna tell you again. Lieutenant, she's locked herself. What am I supposed to do? Just get her out of there. Uh, should I use the gas bomb in there, lieutenant? I hope it don't kill her. I got nothin'. Shh, now, come on. It's alright, it's alright now. It's alright. It's alright, baby. Old Finian sure knows how to make things read mighty religious, don't he? Cheeky, baby. What kind of trouble we in? Real trouble. Mercer wasn't with you that Monday night, was he? Tell him the truth, baby. Go ahead. - No. - Did he tell you what to say? No, not all of it. I made up some of it myself. Officer here is gonna take a new statement. You better be sure you give him the whole truth this time. Another few minutes and your fingers would have felt real good, cheeky baby. I know, baby. I know. Oh, lieutenant, do you mind if I go to my study 'to call my wife.' I mean, I ain't goin' no place else. Yeah, go ahead. [dramatic music] [music continues] Lieutenant, I have a gun and if you don't let me go I'm gonna start drilling this place with holes. And maybe you.. ...or maybe the girl. [gunshots] There's a note, lieutenant. Gun wasn't even loaded. What a dumb thing to do. He wouldn't have got more than two or three years. "Please don't tell my wife about the empty gun, she'll laugh. Lemme go grand." [engine revving] [dramatic music] Where are you going with that? Well, I thought you'd feel better if I put it in the trunk. Go on now. [Sidney] 'Isn't it early in the week for football game? 'Yeah, they've been making that racket for two days now.' They're having Miss Black Venture County or.. ...some contest here tonight. Man, you oughta see the broads in that place. Well, Joey.. Thank you. I gotta hit to John, I'm takin' a rest off here. Wait, don't you think we oughta be gettin' on? I've been hackin' it all night long I can't spend on it forever, give me a break. [music continues] Sure we are gettin' you on that one. Alright, give me the cue, okay, Miguel? From Del Mar Junior College, Miss Debbie Jigson. [whistles] You're on roller skates, baby. That's it, okay! Come on! From Santa Paula, Miss Odada Jasmerry. Odada Jasmerry, that right, dear? Okay, come on. Hold it just there, what is this, bum bum bum? We ain't going no strip here. And you ain't Tina Turner neither. - Humph. - Oh, girls, look. You and I are no different 'but as far as tonight's audience gotta know' you as virgin as my ass is black, dig it? Now, shake it a little less 'and squeeze it together a little more.' Finian? - We're gonna burry your head. - Get off! You hear me? You hear me? [Lt. Carl] 'We expect to capture their leader and recover' 'the stolen jewels momentarily.' Get that up to P.R. and tell him to fix it. Mention my name. About time this department got some good publicity. Lt. Knowles is here to see you, sir. Well, send him in. Oh, god damn it, Knowles, what am I gonna do with you? 'The commissioner wants a black officer at the business' and you get it. Then you go into business with a Jesus freak bookmaker. Oh, Jesus, Knowles. Tell you, you got me over the barrel in a whole new way. Oh-ho, you got it all wrong, captain. Oh, I got you dead to rights, Knowles. - Finian fingered you. - Oh, you've been had, captain. Finian's a confessed criminal. His testimony don't mean a damn thing. 'And you're a crook, Knowles.' And I'm gonna get the grand jury to indict ya. - 'You really think so?' - Uh-huh. After all I did, umm, break the Barren keep case. And I am the token black officer in the division.
