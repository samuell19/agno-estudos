RIP-FIXES-SYNC by VaVooM I love weddings. Really, I love everything about them. There's something magical about family and friends coming together to watch two people promise to love one another, forever. By the way, that's not me. I'm over there. That's me, Jessica Parks! Like I said, "I love weddings". I love them so much in fact that all my friends ask me to plan theirs. Turns out I'm pretty good at it. All those precious moments, you know, the ones, where the bride playfully and spontaneously smears cake into the groom's face? Yeah, I planned it. The time, the camera angle, the cake placement, everything. OK, yeah, yeah. OK, one second, please. If it happens during the wedding, it's because I planned it that way. Hi! That went well! Hey, Michelle. One vegan dish coming up. Best wedding photographer in the city. Lucky to get him. Amazing cupcakes, Jess. So glad you helped organize Tina's wedding. - You're such a good friend. - Well, team effort. Actually, not to sound too immodest, I kind of masterminded this whole thing. I can't imagine how beautiful your wedding day will be. Someday... That's Rob. He's my date. I know it's a little early in the relationship to be inviting someone to a wedding, but we've really been jiving, so I figured a wedding can only bring us closer. Right? - Hey. - Hey. I think we need to split up. I did not plan this. What? Look, it's... it's not you. You are... you are great. OK, well, if I'm so great, why are you splitting up with me? I just feel like we never really... I don't know, jived. Also, I ran into my ex-girlfriend. I... I think we're really reconnecting, you know? Yeah, so I think we gonna leave. Hi. OK. Thanks, Liam. Molly, looking strong and ready; when's the due date? - Four more weeks. - Alright. Can't wait to meet - the little guy. Or girl. - Hey, Ted. Thanks for hooking up my cousin with a guest pass, man. - Really appreciate it. - Yeah. Well, I got some pull. I am the Ted of "Ted's Gym". Jess, are you OK? He dumped me. Yeah. Rob dumped me, so that's good. I'm sorry. He seemed nice. Yeah, he was. - He was. - Didn't see it coming? - How... - OK, OK, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Come on, we'll get you cleaned up, OK? "See it coming"... - Is that coffee? - No, it's water. You need to hydrate, make you feel better. Thank you. So... you say he broke up with you at the wedding? No, no. He broke up with me at the reception, not at the service, which I thought was very sweet of him. Yeah, it's very sweet, but I think he's a jerk, and he doesn't deserve you and you should forget about him. Jess, you're... kind and intelligent and beautiful and everything that anybody could ever ask for. - Everyone except for Rob. - Forget Rob. Somebody better will come along, I promise. You always took such good care of me. You still do. We take care of each other. It's what best friends do, right? Drink. Speaking of, I've been thinking a lot lately about life and love and friendship. Jess... I'm engaged. - Wha... What?! - I know, it's crazy. - Who? What? Where? - And sudden. - I mean, congratulations! - Thanks. I didn't even know you were dating. I mean, usually, you tell me you're dating. I know. That's kind of part of the thing. I didn't want you to disapprove. Disapprove? Why would I disapprove? Do I know her? Is it one of your ex-girlfriends? Is it Amanda? Because I want you to be happy, Ted, but not with Amanda. No, no, it's not Amanda. Is it the one who made those creepy porcelain doll things? - What was her name? - Terry. - Terry?! - No, it's not Terry. OK, good. She was weird. It's Kimberly Kentwood. Kimberly Kentwood... the meanest girl in high school, Kimberly Kentwood? - OK, I'd rather it'd be Scary Terry. - OK, look, I know what you're thinking, but she's totally changed. Wouldn't even recognize her anymore. She looks different? Well, no, she looks the same. Actually, it's kind of weird. Thank goodness! I mean, Kimberly Kentwood still looks gorgeous. I'm... Do you remember high school when you were "Big Ted" and her and all of her friends made fun of you and me? Yeah, but everybody made fun of me for being Big Ted. Not everyone. She's amazing now, OK? She just got out of a long-term relationship, and it made her think about her life and it totally changed her. I swear. OK. If you are telling me that the Queen of Mean has changed, then, I believe you. Thank you. There's one more thing. You know, you really like to plan weddings, right? - And you're really good at it. - Yes. - And you're my best friend... - Take that, Kimberly Kentwood. - So will you be my best woman? - What? - Just like a best man, but a woman. - I know what a best woman is. OK, so...? I would... I would... I would love to. Yes. - Amazing! - Amazing! I get to plan my best friend's wedding. To Kimberly Kentwood. So what did you say? He's my best friend; of course I said yes. Tough break, Jess. Single again. - Check. - Eating cupcakes for dinner. - Check, check. - And your incredibly hot and successful best friend marrying the high school mean girl. Any more checks, I'm gonna start sounding like a chicken. Hey, why didn't you ever date him? - Ted?! - Yes, Ted. You're always talking about how amazing he is, and imagine how cute your kids would be. - OK, no. Enough. That's... - Just sayin'. And cupcakes for dinner? Probably shouldn't make it a habit. Know what I mean? And he broke up with you right there at the wedding? Well, technically, it was at the reception, but yes. She said at the reception. Pay attention, Beatrice. I am paying attention. Well, then turn up your hearing aid! And, Jessica dear, if he broke up with you, - then he's a jerk. - Not the only jerk around here. Ladies! I think the real issue here is that her best friend is engaged. Isn't that right, Jess? Yeah. I mean, Ted is a great guy, and I want him to be happy, just not with Kimberly Kentwood. She sounds like a jerk too. OK, I don't know if I support your flagrant use of the word jerk here, Doris, but... yeah, she's... she's a jerk. She was a jerk. But as his best friend, you're gonna support his decision and help him plan a great wedding, right? Yes. Of course, Mr. Mulligan. You know what you should do? Find someone that Ted hated in high school and date him. OK. Well, thank you for the suggestion, Doris. Just for now, let's just call that plan B. The point is, Doris, Jess likes Ted. No. No, no, no. No, no. No, I don't... I don't... I don't like Ted. I mean not like that. We're just... we're just best friends. I find this all rather confusing. I'm gonna grab a cookie from the mess hall. - Come on, Beatrice, let's... - OK, OK. Watch... watch your sugar levels, ladies. Especially you, Doris! Sure you didn't want a cookie? Believe me, I've had more than my share of cookies in my time. Hey... The bad days make you appreciate the good ones. And just remember, he's still your best friend no matter who he marries. Old people are so smart. One of the benefits of hanging around so long. That and free cookies in the mess hall. Hey, Mom, it's me! Not like a robber or anything. Sweetie! How are you? - Hi! Good. You guys? - We're so excited. Little Teddy getting married, I feel so old. Oh, please! You guys act like half your age! Well, that's true. Do you feel like a bite to eat? No. I'm just gonna go in my old room and wait for Ted and his fiance to show up. Yes, yes, fiance. I hear you all went to school together; do you remember her? Vaguely. Ted. Jessica. Hello. How are you? Kimberly Kentwood is in my house. Well, this is Jess' mother. So nice to meet you. - Speaking of, where's Jess? - She's been upstairs for a while. Jess, darling, you're alright? Way to go, Jess, you forgot how to walk down the stairs? Ted! Don't embarrass your best woman. Hi, Kim. How are you? Jessica! We're old friends, come here. "Old friends". OK. Well, congratulations! Thank you! I never, in a million years, thought I would ever get married, - especially to such a gem as this one. - He is a gem. - You're too kind. - No, we're not. You are a great guy. Back me up here, Jess. What? Ted? Yeah. I mean, he's cool. Why, thank you so much for that ringing endorsement. She's just being funny. Come on, Jess, you know Ted better than anyone here. Yeah, I mean, Ted is everything a girl could want in a partner. I mean... if you're into the whole, like, tall, handsome, smart, funny kind of thing, which I don't look for. I'm not... I'm not... I'm sorry, I'm not into it. But if you are, then that's good for you. OK. Shall we get started? - Yeah. - Yeah. OK. So we're gonna put the head table over here, and we're gonna put the bar in that corner, and there's gonna be a bunch of chicken fingers for all of your guests as a request of the groom. What? I like chicken fingers. Yeah, he really likes chicken fingers this guy. You like it? I'll let you win that one, buddy. You know what I would love? Stringed lights from tree to tree. I was thinking the same thing. And could we get those old-style lightbulbs? The ones where you can see the filament inside, what are they called? Edison bulbs! - Yeah, that's it! Neat! - I love that we make such a great team! I love that the two most important women in my life are getting along so well. Really? Two most important women? I don't remember seeing either of them when I was spending 12 hours in labour with you. Well, obviously, I mean next to you, Mom. - I'm sure you did. - Hi, Mrs. Cooper. How are you? Little Jessica! It's been too long. - And here she is, my daughter-in-law to be. - Gale, nice to see you. Speaking of women in my life, have we told Grams about the engagement party yet? Yes. We just need someone to pick her up. - I can do that! - You sure? - I know you kind of got a lot on your plate. - I love Grams! Yeah, I can arrange for someone to pick her up. - OK, thanks. - You guys about done here? I want to show Kim your childhood bedroom. Yes, please. Yeah, we pretty much covered everything, so... Well, yeah, why don't you take her up to see my room, and I'm gonna go over one more thing with Jess. - Go over what? - I'll show you, come on. You sure you want to go up there? You're kidding me? It was like the most important place in the world to me as a kid. - OK. - Let's go. I haven't been in here in years. Bringing back so many memories. Yeah. Me too. You used to tell me not to pay attention to those kids who made fun of me for being Big Ted. Yeah, and you would assure me that Billy Clark would ask me out, which, by the way, has never happened. You deserve better than the Billy Clarks of the world. Who thought we'd be here planning my wedding? I know. To Kimberly Kentwood. I know. God, we must have been in here a million times trash talking her, and I'm gonna marry her. Do you remember that time when her and her two bully friends... What did we call them? The Gruesome Twosome! Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I do. I remember them. Yeah, but things are different now. You know, we're different. I mean, I just can't figure out how you kept it a secret from me this whole time. Wasn't easy. I wanted to tell you... just didn't know how you'd react. You're my best friend, you're an amazing woman, and you mean everything to me. OK. Ted, you're gonna make me cry, so... I'm serious. You're my best friend... and I love you. I don't mean like... Not like the same way I love Kim obviously, but... Obviously. This is nice. Mr. Mulligan, everything just went to... in a handbasket. - Engagement party planning? - No. Planning was fine. Is this Kimberly person still a jerk? No. Ted was right, she's actually, like, super nice now. So what's the problem? I think I might like, like Ted. - Thought you were just friends. - Yeah. So did I. What happened? We started talking about how we've been friends since childhood, and I started thinking about how amazing he is and how much he means to me and... Jessica, you can care about somebody and admire them without having romantic feelings for them. Are you sure? Listen, you're gonna be spending a lot of time with Ted planning the wedding. You need to use that time to figure out your true feelings for him. Things will turn out. Chin up. Hey, Mrs. Cooper, did you plug in the last of the lights? - Plugged in, ready to go. - Alright, Mr. Cooper, turn 'em on. - Jessica Parks. - It's me. - You sure are good at this. - Thank you, Gale. Can't wait to see what you do with your own wedding someday. Yeah, someday. - Jessica! Hi! - Hi! - Looks incredible! - Thanks, Kim. And the lights, you found... Edison bulbs! You remember Megan and Lauren? We all went to school together. Yeah. Megan and Lauren. - How could I forget? It's good. - Ladies. - Hey! - Ted! - Hey. - Hey. - Hi. - OK... Jess, I can't remember ever seeing this place look so... ...magical. - Magical? - Yeah, magical. - OK, we're using magical. - Thank you. Yeah, Jess. Seriously, thank you. Hey, has anybody seen Grams? Grams? No, but Jess was sending someone to pick her up. - You did send somebody, right? - Yeah. I'm sure she'll be here any minute then. If you would, I can give her a call, see what... No, no, no, no, no, no! I'm gonna call my guy. I'm gonna... Once again. Well, would anyone like to join me for a drink? Yes. Yes, Grams, I'm... Totally my fault. I'm sorry. - How quickly can you be ready? - I'm ready. OK, perfect. I'm gonna send someone to your house to pick you up in 20 minutes. OK... Hi! You've reached. Jess and Blair. Leave a message at the beep. Shoot! Hey, it's me... I need your help. - Hey. - Hey! Got everything figured out with Grams? Yeah, it was just a mix-up with the driver. - She'll be here in a minute. - Great. - I knew I could count on you. - You know me, Trusty Jess. You know, I think Kim was kind of nervous about having the engagement party in my childhood's backyard, - but it turned out really good. - It's a great idea! I mean, you have so much history here. We have so much history here. I was going through old photos of my parents to put together one of those picture montages for the reception. That is a great idea! People love that! There were so many of you and I. Like this one! Do you remember? My 12th birthday, so you and me pretty much in this exact spot. We were so cool! Even back then. Thanks for showing me this. Yeah. It's good memories. You know, the Edison bulbs were my idea. And just what are you two whispering about? - Nothing, it's... nothing. - Guys... it's me, what's up? - It's just that Ted's great and all... - Yeah, and...? But his little friend Jessica... Yeah, they were best friends. Well, just make sure that she doesn't think that it's more than that. We're just trying to watch your back, that's all. I have to take this, but you enjoy the rest of your party. Yeah. OK. - Patrick! - Perfect! Perfect! Patrick! One grandmother delivered. - Grams, are you OK back there? - Are you kidding me? Most fun I've had in years. Give me a hug. So nice to see you! OK, everyone's in the back. Go on in and I'll meet up with you in a minute. Maybe sooner. Mr. Mulligan! On your scooter, what are you thinking? Well, it was either this or try to steal the bus from the retirement home. OK, she's safe, she's here, that's all that matters. So what happened? How did you forget the grandmother? You know, I'm just... Simple mistake. The Jess I know doesn't usually mess up when she's planning a wedding. OK, well, don't read too much into it. But thank you and I'm gonna find a safer ride home for her. Well, if you can't, give me a call. So I'll show them the garden first where people usually set up the tents. Yeah, we should be there shortly. I'm just waiting for my bride and groom. Gotta go. - Hi! - Hi! Where's Ted? He's running a little late, he'll meet us here. OK. Alright. It will give us a chance to get to know each other a little more. Lead the way. So we're gonna put the chairs on the left and right for the bride's and groom's parties, and that creates an aisle down the middle. And the service will be here, which obviously gives you a beautiful backdrop for your wedding photos. Jess, this is beautiful. You know, when I was a little girl, I used to always dreamed of having my wedding at the St. Joseph's Castle in midtown. Yeah, I think we all had that dream. But I guess, apparently, they haven't had weddings there in years. I tried, it's like virtually impossible. Well, this is a great second choice. Yeah. So... you and Ted... why didn't you guys ever hook up? We're just... It's not like that between us. Never? I don't know, I'm just asking because it just seems like the two of you would be a perfect fit for one another. Yeah. Well, people ask us that all the time, but we just don't feel that way about each other, but... No, like, Ted is obviously amazing, and I have a serious lack of amazing guys in my life, so... I'm sorry, Jess. It's my ex. I have to take this, excuse me. What? I told you, I can't talk about this right now. I'm not having this conversation. - Everything OK? - No. My ex is making my life living... right now. OK, well, if you want to take a break and stop the tour... No. It's fine, Jess, but I really need you to be honest with me, OK? Please. Look, there's Ted! Quick, before he gets here, I need to know. - Do you have feelings for Ted? - No, no, I don't. - I don't have feelings. Hi, Ted. - Hey! - Hi! - Hi. Sorry, I'm late. - And look at this place. - I know, isn't it great? - Yeah. - Perfect. OK, let's go this way, and I'll show you where we're gonna put the dinner tent. - Great. - Yeah. Thank you, Jessica. Alright. OK. I lied to her. I looked her right in the eyes, and I straight up lied to her. Slow down! We still have a little time before the wedding, right? Yeah. Your feelings could all be very innocent. I have feelings for an engaged man, that's not very innocent. No, you think you have feelings for an engaged man. - I... but... - Jessica... someone you've known your entire life, someone very special to you is getting married. And that's the problem. - No, that's the cause of your feelings. - What? Things in your life have been very turbulent lately. A relationship you saw going forward ended forcing you to look backwards. That could easily create a confusing situation for anyone. My life has been very... How did you put it? - Turbulent. - Turbulent. It would explain why you've been distracted and forgot to arrange a ride for Ted's grandmother. Well, don't worry because from now on, I'm just gonna be like, laser focus and... Oh! Shoot. You've made another mistake, haven't you? Don't worry. This one I can fix. - Hi, guys! - Hey, Jess! - What's this? - Cool, right? Yeah. When you said you got a surprise for the wedding party, not exactly what I pictured. Seriously, what's going on? OK, the bus rental company messed up the reservation. But it's cool, I borrowed this bus from work. All aboard! OK. Hey, can you get this to the wedding venue by Tuesday? They need it by Tuesday or we're gonna lose the place. - Yeah, I'll take care of it. - Thank you. So, Jess, where are we going? Don't worry, you're gonna love it. Alright. Okeydoke! OK, here we go! Are you sure about this? Absolutely. It's gonna be a blast. Yeah, totally! Alright, you've all been told the rules, and everyone knows how to play this game. It's the bride's party... versus the groom's! Happy hunting, everyone. Guys! - You seem to be enjoying yourself. - Well, yeah. I always wanted to do this. How did you know? I am your best woman, it's my job to know these things. You know what this reminds me of? You remember your 10th birthday with the water-balloon fight? Hey, that wasn't a fight. That was a full-out water-balloon war. Who knew Ted's old nerd friends from high school... ...would be such good shots at paintball? They're probably working out some residual anger they hold again us for how we treated them back then. - Especially you, Lauren. - Hey! Well, come on, guys, we were pretty mean back then. - I'm just glad we grew up. - Some more than others. - Hey, I am nice... sometimes. - Yeah, you're just a regular saint. I'm gonna go take a look and see if the coast is clear. Coast is not clear! Definitely not clear! Those nerds really hate you. Speaking of nerds from high school, have you been keeping an eye on that best woman of yours? Yeah. We talked the other day. Her and Ted are just friends. She doesn't have feelings for him. You're so sure about that? - They look pretty chummy over there. - What? It was fun. I loved that party! It was like my favourite one. You ate my whole cake. I had no more cake! No! That's what we did. I mean, it's what I did. I was hungry, it was good cake. No, Brian, that is not what we decided to do with the house. What does she have to do with this? Brian, why are you being like this? Brian? Brian! Hey, Kim. Is everything OK? No. My ex just continues to make my life as difficult as he can. Sorry. Is there anything I can do to help? No, Jessica, there's nothing you can do. You know what? Actually, there is something you can do. Maybe try not being in love with my fiance. Kim, I told you, Ted and I are just friends... I know that's what you said, but you lied, OK? It is so obvious to me that you have feelings for him. - No, I don't have feelings. - I see the way you look at him. - Just now... - Hey, hey, whoa, whoa. What is going on here? Would you like to tell him, Jessica, or should I? Tell him what? Your best woman over here has feelings for you. - What is she talking about? - It's not true. It is true. I see the way she looks at you. Jess? OK, look, Ted. You and I have been best friends for like forever. OK? And this is just an emotional time for everyone, alright? My best friend is getting married, OK? To an amazing woman! Yeah, you were mean in high school, OK, but Ted is right. You've become an incredible person. Where does that leave me? I know I'm going to see less of you. - Jess... - Look, it's fine, OK? I've been thinking about it, and, look, I am happy for you, OK? I really am. But everything is changing, and I just... I just thought we never would. Kim, I do not have feelings for Ted, OK? We are just best friends, and I really, really don't want to lose my best friend. Jess, I'm getting married, I'm not going anywhere. And, Kim, I've known Jess our whole life, and we never had feelings like that ever. And if she did, I would know. Yeah. I mean, I've seen your fiance. He's, like, kind of homely. Not into it. I'm sorry, you guys. It's just crazy wedding emotions, I guess. It's all good. You know, weddings can be, turbulent. You go back inside, take your anger out with little balls of paint. This peanut butter tastes strange. It's almond butter. Almonds?! Why almonds? - Why not peanuts? - Less fat. Actually, it's not bad. So, what grand realization did you come to? What makes you think I came up with some sort of grand realization? Well, let's see. You're here on your day off, it's early even for you, and you're wearing sweat pants and a hoodie. It's complicated. How so? Either you realized you liked Ted or you realized you don't like him. - It's one or the other. - No. It's worse than that. I realize that there's something we haven't been considering this entire time. What's that? Doesn't matter if I like Ted or if I don't like Ted, 'cause yesterday I realized that I do like Ted. I mean, like, like him. - Great! - No. Yesterday, I also realized that Ted doesn't like, like me. Yeah. You're right. Never thought of that. Which is strange 'cause I usually think of everything. I must be getting old. I think I like peanut butter better. Mouth is dry. So, we've progressed from cupcakes to popcorn for dinner. Well, at least those were vegetables, once. Ted's coming over. We're watching scary movies. Jess and Ted's scary movie night, classic! Do you think you're gonna be able to keep the tradition alive... ...after he's married? I'm not sure. I mean, would you want your husband hanging around with some other woman watching movies? Probably not. You know, it's strange. I always thought Ted liked, liked you. Really? Yeah. Just a vibe I've always had. Oh, well! - What? - What? What? No, do I have stuff on my face? No, it's nothing. - Hey, you... you like Kim, right? - Yeah. She's awesome. She let you come to movie night with me, right, so... "Let"? It's not like I need permission to hang out with you. Besides, she's happier with me hanging out here with you than if I was having a bachelor party, right? - Yeah, that's smart. - So we went out the other day... ...and Kim got me coffee. OK! Yeah, but she got me coffee with a lot of cream and sugar... - No, but you take it black. - I know, I know. Well, you used to take it with a bunch of cream and sugar, and then you switched from two creams and two sugars to two milks and two sweeteners because in college you thought that was healthier. And now you straight up copied me, and you get black coffee now. See? You know. Yeah, I don't think it matters if she knows your coffee order, right? What I mean, shouldn't two people who are getting married know each other the way you and I know each other? I don't... I don't think it matters how long you've known each other, right? I think what matters is the amount of time you're gonna spend getting to know each other. And I have a huge advantage. I mean, I've had a lot of time to get to know Ted Cooper. And Kim is just getting started. You're right. You're right as usual, but we gotta wrap this up. I gotta go do a work thing. No, no, no. We're gonna go hang out with the guys. No, gotta do a work thing. It just came up, got a big project for a big client I gotta finish. We were gonna be up all night! That's very true. Probably 'til the morning. Well, why did you come to movie night? Well, it's scary movie night, I love scary movie night. Yeah, but we could be out with the gang right now, you know? Yeah. Alright. I'd take hanging out with you over anyone. Yeah. Me too. Hey, guys! Hey! Scary movie night. - OK. - Yeah, so I gotta run... Don't let me interrupt. No, you're not interrupting anything. He has to go do a work thing. He has a presentation in the morning. Well then, I guess you need to get going. Yeah. So... Wanna stay, can't. Tell the brains I said hi, and I will make it up to them. Sure! - OK, what the heck was that? - What? Why, why? I told you "He like, likes you". Good luck dealing with that. I'm gonna be in my room. And there was that kid that dressed as Marilyn Monroe senior year of the Halloween dance. And he tripped on the bleachers and bounced like three feet up in the air... ...and landed with the dress on his face. - What was the kid's name again? - I can't remember. - Jess would know. - Jess? Jess? - What? - What was the name of the guy, senior year dressed as Marilyn Monroe for the Halloween dance? - Ben something. - That's right. - Ben Scott! - Ben Scott! I love that guy! Jess... ...are you OK? - Me? - Yeah. You seem a little distracted. It's just a bunch of wedding planning stuff on my mind. Well, we heard that you and Kim had a fight in the parking lot. It wasn't a fight. It was nothing, really. Was Kimberly Kentwood, the Queen of Mean, - being her old self again? - No! Kim is... legitimately nice now. Sure she is. - It's probably all an act. - No, guys, she's changed. A tiger never changes its stripes. Yeah. If she's so nice, then why were you two arguing? Kim thinks... She thinks I have feelings for Ted. Yeah, and...? Well, she's gonna marry the guy, and she doesn't want the best woman crushing on her fiance. You know, we all thought that you two would get married. What? Oh yeah. I think the whole school felt that way. You guys were like always together. Before class, lunch, after class, like always. - And you guys had that special connection. - We're just friends. - Now he's marrying that jerk! - She is nice now! - I'm telling you. - A tiger never changes its stripes. I can't believe your wedding is so close. You can't believe it? I'm the one who's walking down the aisle. I remember we used to hang around and imagined who we'd get married to. I remember. Famous actors, rich athletes, a prince from a foreign land. Big Ted... Hey! OK, fine. Maybe Ted wasn't the coolest kid in school. - You could say that again. - But people grow. They evolve, they change. Maybe you two could, I don't know, be happy that Ted grew up to be my real-life prince. - Kimberly Kentwood. - Melinda! So, how did it turn out? Exquisite. Probably some of my best work. - Yeah? - You excited to try it on? - So excited! - Come on. She's coming. Come here. - So? - Kimberly! Oh my! - What do you think? - Kim, you look beautiful. - Stunning! - Really? Thanks, guys. Megan, are you gonna cry? It's nothing. I'm just so happy for you. We both are. Ted is such a great guy, everyone likes him. Yeah. It's no wonder that he's getting married and we aren't. Sweetie, there's someone out there for everyone. So, Lauren and I were talking and... And...? - And we're super happy for you, Kim. - Super happy. OK, what's up? I know you two. I know when something's on your mind. We've just always wanted what's best for you. We feel protective of you. All through high school, you made sure that we were treated like royalty. Yeah. You guys, I love you. You're like my family. And as your family, we just want to make sure that you are absolutely ready for this next step. We've been over this. I'm ready. I'm absolutely ready. We're just asking because it's so sudden, and you two are so different. So different. Lauren and I always thought... ...you and Mark were perfect for each other. Are you sure you're over him, and this isn't just a rebound? Guys, Ted is... everything a girl could ever want. But is he everything you want? Mark understood Kimberly Kentwood like most other people don't. You guys used to talk for hours. Yeah. And what do you and Ted talk about? I don't know... stuff. - The wedding. - But what about after the wedding? Guys, Ted is amazing. Okay? He's... unselfish, and funny and warm. He is, but why don't you give Mark a call just to make sure that nothing's still there. And if you talk to him and you still feel that Ted is the one, then we will be at your wedding all smiles. Genuine smiles. No. No, absolutely not. What do you have to lose? Hello? Ted? Ted? Are you there? I'm just dropping off your tux. Kim? Are you here? Ted? I know Ted's an amazing guy, but I just... I don't know sometimes, you know? I don't know, my friends keep telling me that it's just cold feet, but what if it's not? What if I'm not supposed to marry Ted? I know. I just... I just needed someone to talk to, and you know me better than anyone. I know. And I love you too. Hey, can I call you back? Jessica?! What are you doing here? "A tiger never changes its stripes". What? OK, I don't know what you think you heard, but it's not what it sounded like. I heard everything! You're gonna break up with Ted, and you're gonna run back to your ex! OK. Jess, that is not it at all. Hon, I'm home! Hey, I see Jess' car, is she here? - I have to tell Ted. - What? No! Jessica! Jess, wait! - Ted! - Jess, hey. Hi. - What are you doing here? - I came to drop off your tux. OK. Thanks. No, Ted, when I got here, I heard a noise, so I went upstairs to your bedroom. OK, Jess, what's going on? She's gonna call off the wedding. Wait, she's gonna...? Kim? It's not true, Ted. She doesn't know what she's talking about. You're a liar. I heard you on your phone with your ex. You were questioning the relationship. I heard you tell your ex you love him. OK, Kim, what's going on? Do you not want to get married? Of course I want to get married. I'm just... I've been having some pre-wedding jitters. You know, cold feet. But that's it, right? Just... just cold feet? Yes. I got cold feet too. Getting married is scary. - You have to talk to me. - Yeah. - Not your ex, who you love. - But you hate your ex. Of course I hate my ex! Like I tried telling Jessica after I caught her eavesdropping, I wasn't on the phone with my ex. I was on the phone with my dad. You were talking to your dad? Yes, Ted. You have Jessica, OK? I've always called my dad when I need someone to talk to. OK, this is sounding very convenient. Here. Look at my phone. See who the last person I called was. - Yeah, your dad's number. - Thank you. Jess, what... I'm so sorry. Ted, I have told you that she has feelings for you, OK? She's trying to break up this wedding. I should go. I'm gonna go. Jess... Jessica... is that what I think it is? That's the... Jess, that's the deposit! I told you they needed it by Tuesday or we're gonna lose the location! Wait a second. Are you telling me that we don't have a wedding venue right now? I can fix it. Okay? We're getting married this weekend, and we don't have a wedding venue. Yeah, Jess, I think you need to go. And... ...maybe you shouldn't be at the wedding either. Wherever it may be at this point. Honey, that might be a bit much, huh? Really, you think so? I wouldn't want to ruin your special day. - I know. - I mean... I know, I just screwed things up so badly. I'm usually a pretty positive guy, but... I know, I know. I totally messed up, and he's my best friend. What do I do? I think you're gonna have to figure this one out on your own. Yeah. I do know this. A life is not defined by a single mistake or action. It's a culmination of all thoughts and all actions. So too is a relationship. You're right. You're... I know what I'm gonna do. Thank you! Thank you, you wise, wise old man! You're my ride. I should have listened to you. You guys were right about Jessica, I never should have trusted her. Well, what happened? Ted gave her the deposit for our wedding venue, and she never passed it along. She completely sabotaged our entire wedding! I'm telling you, she never wanted it to happen. - We told you, Kim. - I guess I just... ...thought that we'd all moved on. Hi, Cam! It's Jess Parks. You remember me, cool. I'm good, thanks. Remember your wedding when you said if I never need a favour or anything to just, you know, give you a call? Well... ring-ring. Hi. Hi, Annie. It's Jessica Parks. Yeah, remember that favour you owe me? Yeah. Well... Hey, Patrick! It's Jessica. Yeah. I need a favour. OK, so remember, shoulders back, spine straight, go forward. Good, good. Front foot a little bit more. Perfect. Perfect. Just one second. - Grams? - Theodore, it's Grams. I hope I'm not bothering you. No, no. Of course not. What's going on? Is everything OK? Well... this might sound silly, but I know you're getting married tomorrow. Can you meet me in an hour? I have something for you. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I can do that. Just tell me where. Hello? Kimberly darling, it's Ted's grandmother. Oh, Grams! So nice to hear from you. Is everything OK? Oh, yes, darling. I'm fine. There something I'd like you to do for me. Kim? Hey, what are you doing here? What? Grams called me. She told me that you wanted to meet me here. Strange. Grams called me and said she wanted to meet me here. - What? What's going on? - I don't know. Sorry for the white lies, but we needed to make sure you'd both come. Grams, why are we here? Are you Ted Cooper of the Cooper-Kentwood wedding? Yeah. Who are you? I'm with St. Joseph's Castle. Somebody called my boss. Well, they called my boss' boss' boss actually and pulled a few strings. I'm sorry. "A few strings"? We don't usually do this anymore, but here is a special permit to hold a wedding here tomorrow. Here? - Yeah. - We can have our wedding here? - We can have our wedding here? - Just sign here. - What? - Deposit's been paid. - Thank you. - The place is all yours 10 a.m. to midnight. I hope that's enough time. Yes! Yes, of course it's enough time! Like I said to the lady on the phone, you're responsible for your own setup, so tables, chairs, whatnot. - OK, yeah. - Thank you. Ted, I told Jess it was my dream to have our wedding here. I can't believe she pulled this off. Apparently, over the last couple of years helping so many people to plan their weddings, she's earned a few favours that she called in. You guys call all your guests to give them the new location. Jess called in a few more favours, we're gonna have this place set up and looking beautiful first thing in the morning. Ted! I'm so happy! - I'm gonna go look around. - OK. She's quite a girl. Yeah. Yeah, she is. I was talking about Jess. Morning, everyone! Thank you all for coming. I know Jess really appreciates it. Listen, we only have a few hours to get this place ready for a wedding, so... ...let's get at it. There we go! - Are you trying to be undercover? - I want everything to be perfect, but I don't want Ted or Kim to know I'm here. I'm sure they forgive you. Here's your walkie. Let's do this. That's good, girls. That's good. Yeah, that's perfect. Thanks, guys, thanks. Patrick? Yeah? Yeah. Make sure you put one of those centrepieces on every single table. Those are Kim's favourite flowers. You got it. OK. Move... move the gift table. Patrick! Yeah? Doris, don't pluck the flowers. Don't pluck. Put the flowers on the table. They're going there. Did you guys hear something? - No. - No. I guess it was nothing. The cake! It's perfect. Cake's coming. The cake looks beautiful. It was close. How's everything going? Everything's great, it's gonna be beautiful, but listen, - we have a major issue. - Quick! Quick! - What's with the shoving? - Sorry, sorry, I freaked out! You could have pushed my hip right out of place! Shoot, Kim's coming over here. Listen, there's something I need to tell you. Uncle Jack! So nice of you to call. I know. I'm so sorry you and Aunt Pearl couldn't make it. - That was fun. - Yeah, real riot. - Listen, we have a problem. - No! Doris hitting on the caterer again? No. Well, maybe. That is so sweet of you to say, Uncle Jack. Listen, I promise Ted and I... ...will make our way overseas as soon as we can, OK? OK. Love you too. That was close. Listen, you have to listen to me. We have a problem. OK, what? - No one has seen Ted. - No one's seen Ted? No one's seen Ted?! This is heavy. Jessica! Mrs. Cooper! Jessica, thank goodness you're here. - You can't find Ted? - We've looked everywhere. He's not at his house, his gym, anywhere. And you tried calling his cell obviously. Straight to voicemail. Jessica, I know you two had a fight, but you know him better than anyone... ...do you have any idea where he might be? I think I might know a place. OK, I'm gonna go there now, and you try to stall the wedding ceremony, and I'll bring him here as soon as possible. - Please, Jessica, hurry. - I'm on it. I think I might know where Ted is. Do you have the keys to the van? No, but I have something I think might help. Ted, fancy seeing you here. - You're still mad at me? - No. Points for Jess. No. No points for Jess. Yeah, you got Kim her dream wedding venue, but you messed up, like, everything else. - I didn't mean to. - I know. You accused her of cheating on me and wanting to get back with her ex the week of our wedding. Yeah. Definitely no points for that one. I was just living in the past. Our past. I mean, I... I was convinced that Kim was just gonna be that same mean queen from high school, you know. It's not who she is anymore. You have to let people change sometimes... and become the better versions of themselves, and I... ...I didn't let Kim do that. I just kept jumping to conclusions. Yeah. You weren't the only one. What do you mean? This wedding, we just rushed into it. Wha... Sometimes, people fall in love quickly. Yeah... Look, I love the idea of marrying Kim, you know? I mean, I was stuck in the past too. I still thought of myself as Big Ted. I thought that the prom queen wanted to date me, marry me. Just... Look, you haven't been Big Ted in years. And even when you were, you were like... the best guy in high school. I mean, why do you think I stuck around for so long? And whether you're Big Ted or, you know, Hunky Successful Ted... ...you are still Ted. You are an amazing, funny, smart guy, who's like, you know, a little scared of horror movies. You've always been my best friend, and the thought that you weren't gonna be at my wedding just killed me. Me too. I'm here now. And there's still time to talk to Kim and get everything figured out before you guys get married. That's the thing. I'm not sure that Kim is the one that I'm meant to marry. I don't know, Jess. What do you think, should I marry Kim? This is just... way too big for me to make for you. You know what? My house, Kim said that you had feelings for me. Is that true? Do you love me? Ted... I do love you. But as friends, as best friends. Go marry the prom queen. And... as your best woman, it is my duty to inform you that you have an amazing woman waiting for you, and, you know, what I hear is, a beautifully decorated wedding venue that has singlehandedly used up my life accumulation of favours. It's my job to get you there, you know, no matter what. - Let's go! - OK. Yeah, I'm getting there. I'm getting it on. - Alright, you're ready? - Yeah. OK. OK, wait! Close your eyes, it's bad luck to see the bride before the ceremony. What? Kim! Ted. Don't worry, they're closed. No, it's OK, Ted. I think you can open your eyes. I knew you'd be with her. No, Kim, it's not like that, I swear... No. I didn't mean it like that. I just meant that if anybody could find Ted when nobody else could, it would be you, Jess. I am so sorry that I'm late. No, Ted, it's actually a good thing. While I was here waiting for you, it gave me some time to think, and everybody here needs to be honest with each other and themselves. What do you mean? Ted, we rushed into this. And yes, I really do love you, but... I'm just not so sure that I am "in love" with you. And I'm not totally sure that you're in love with me either. So... so we date a little bit longer. We could push the wedding... Ted, I've watched you two over these past couple of weeks while we were putting the wedding together, and the truth is... I want what you guys have. I'm not trying to hurt you, Ted. I'm just trying to be honest with you. And I guess... maybe for the first time, honest with myself. I was really mean in high school. Marrying Big Ted, that would prove that I am not that mean girl anymore. But I don't know, maybe that's not the best foundation on which to build a marriage. Do you understand? Prom queen and Big Ted, who would have thunk it, huh? Guess if I'm being honest, I know you're right. Yeah. And I think it's time for the two of you to be honest with each other, OK? I've seen you two together, and there's way more here than just friends. I'm sorry, Jess, for being mean to you. Not just at paintball or in Ted's house, but for all the times I've ever been mean. Thank you. Regret is a really horrible thing, so can you just figure this thing out between you two already? Ted! Where have you been? And Kim, is she leaving? Yeah. Yeah, Mom, there's no wedding today. Baby, are you OK? What happened? Yeah, actually... Kim just wasn't... isn't the right person for me. Well, it's better you figure that out now and not years down the road. Thank you for finding our Teddy Âear again. - "Teddy Âear"? - Don't. - Is that like new or...? - Don't. No. - Why didn't I know about this? - No. No, no, no. Why didn't you tell me about this? No. This is not a thing! Oh, my gosh, this cake is so good! You know, this might be the most beautiful wedding you've ever planned, but nobody actually got married. For you, I would plan an infinite amount of non-weddings. I'm still getting paid, right? Well, they can't all end in disaster. What? What are you staring at? You. You know what I'm thinking? I think I do. Well, anyone knows me well enough, it would be you. And what are you thinking? How overwhelming my desire is to shove this cake in your face. That's exactly what I was thinking. Like I said before, "I love weddings". I love everything about them. There's something magical about family and friends coming together to watch two people promise to love one another forever. I love weddings so much that I plan them right down to the last detail. But I'd never have planned this. Or did I? RIP-FIXES-SYNC by VaVooM
