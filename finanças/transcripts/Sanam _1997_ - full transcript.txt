Let it go, it's our car. My dear brothers, you've to.. ..snatch your rights from India. You're peace loving, not cowards. For this war of freedom, you've to use weapons. You've to shed blood. We're ready! We're ready! We'll help you in every way. Supply weapons, provide training. Just remember one thing.. ..every Indian is your enemy. Hail freedom! Hail freedom! Hail freedom! What happened to the consignment.. ..of weapons that our neighbouring.. ..countries were supposed to send us? It has arrived. But where will.. ..we store such a large consignment? Have you arranged for a warehouse in India? - Yes. This is a village named Dhanakpur, it's very close to our border. There's only a bridge that connects.. ..this village to the city. The villagers close this bridge at night. The weapons can be stored there at night, very easily. And our men shall transport it to the other.. ..parts of India during the day. This time, we've found the atom bomb to destroy India. Dhanakpur! May God.. May God do so, that a point comes, in love.. May God do so, that a point comes, in love.. ..on my lips always, should be, the name of my beloved. On my lips always, should be, the name of my beloved. May God.. No one can destroy this story of the heart. I'll remember you, even after forgetting this world. Whenever I open my eyes, your greetings arrive. On my lips always, should be, the name of my beloved. On my lips always, should be, the name of my beloved. May God.. Munna, where's Gaurav? Hey, Gaurav, why are you standing there? Do you plan to return? I haven't come here to return. Munna, this Manjit has been writing letters.. ..to his beloved since the past six months. But, none of his letters have been replied to. My love is true, so, I'll surely get a reply. The clay I get a reply, I'll show it to all of you. Do show us. Don't write so many hikers, Mani“. Your beloved might fall in love with the postman. What did you say? You're smoking? Where's the packet? This was the last one. Give it to me. I'll smoke this one. Take this, sir. I have the whole packet. Sir, please sit. Sir, your introduction? The lesser I introduce myself, the more will it be. My name's Balwant Sinha. I'm a resident of Patna. I've been working for Major.. ..Khan for the past 15 years. And I'm still an eligible bachelor. Meaning, you haven't got married yet, sir? I'm just 40 years old now. I'll marry when I'm 50. When you get married.. ..you surely give me your address. I'll rent a house near yours. Are you blind? Couldn't you see.. ..that you've bumped into Sanam? Why are you shaking your head like a bull? Can't you hear what I'm asking? Sanam, you move aside, I'll take care of him. He won't listen nicely. Let it be, Chutku. Don't get angry. Seems to be from the army school. This is his first mistake.. ...let's forgive him. If he bumps into to me again.. ..then you thrash him. I won't interfere. Now go. What are you staring at? These soldiers can't find another place". ..for themselves, instead of this. Attention! Boys! You must've heard about me that.. I'm a very strict person. I punish my students very strictly for their mistakes. There are certain rules and regulations here. I can't forgive those who break them. Your training starts from today. And I want that you should.. ..work hard, and.. ..with honesty. Become such, that.. ..this world looks at you with pride. Gaurav, you've taken some oaths.. ...always remember them. I've decided, sir. I've to achieve a lot in life. - Good. This whole area is ours. You can go wherever you want. But, this is a village on that side of the bridge, Dhanakpur. Never go over there. In that village, no soldier.. What's this, pal? Our eyes will be treated there.. ...else we'll go blind. Yes. Sir, does that village belong to our country? - No. It's within our country. But their customs and traditions.. ..have separated them from our country. You will be trained here for the first three months. After that, we shall go to the snowy places. Girls! Wow. Come with me. What'|| the major do to, Munna? - Don't know. But whatever he'll do, it won't be good for him. Don't cut it, sir! Munna, what happened? - Are you all right? What did the major do to you? - Tell us something. He cut off everything. - Everything? Yes, look at this. Your honey is really good. It's much sweeter than the others. Instead of praising, give me some reward, Lala. After a whole week's hard work.. ...I get only one pot of honey. Okay. Okay. Take this. This is good, how much is this? Don't ask, sir, just take it. Say it in Hindi, so that we can understand. How much is this? How much will you give? - Oh, pal! Talk clearly. Chutku, look, the same soldier. The poor fellow is dumb. He can't say anything. But, yesterday morning, we abused him so badly. You give me Rs.30. Rs.200? You should have told, earlier. Sanam, can we do one thing? Let's talk to uncle about this. He's a doctor, he must surely be having a remedy. Till now, no such disease has been discovered.. ..for which, Margatlal doesn't have a cure. ls that clear, Bihari? Take this leaf. Chew it slowly and then swallow it. It will go away, if God wishes so. Who me? - Yes. No! Your pain. - With this single leaf? This isn't an ordinary leaf. This is sanjivani (herb)! Do you think of me to be an ordinary physician? Without looking at the face of the sick.. ..without asking him a single thing.. ..just by feeling his pulse, I can tell his disease. Look at this child, I can feel his.. ...pulse and tell you about his disease. Dear, show me your nadi (pulse). Nadi (string)? Hold it. ls it a pulse? Dry.. ..thin.. It's worse than that of a dead man. This isn't working. What's this that you've given me? You only told me to show my nadi (pulse). Not this nadi (string), but this one, the veins. Uncle, for all this. Give me a remedy. What has happened to you? Nothing has happened to me. I want a medicine for that soldier who can't talk. Which soldier? - Those soldiers who come to train.. ..on that side of the bridge. On that side of the bridge?! Then I can't treat him. Sanam, you know it very well that.. ...no one from our village". ..maintains any kind of relation with any foreigner. Aren't foreigners, humans? Why are you pleading to him? This fool can't make such a medicine.. ..that can sure a dumb person. I can't make such a medicine? Sanam.. ..this medicine is very bitter. 15 bushes of Neem and 10 kilograms of bitter-gourds.. ..are cooked together. Only then you get one dose of that medicine. But it's so bitter that.. You don't worry about that, uncle. He'll get back his voice. Then, he will pray for us. You prepare the medicine, I'll make him drink it somehow. Sanam, make him drink it. No, don't spit it. Drink it, fully. I'm dead! - The soldier spoke! Shut up! Hooligan! Villager! llliterate fool! You're talking so sweetly.. "as soon as you've found your voice. It would have been better, had you remained dumb. I'm not dumb. I can talk since birth. If that was so, then why didn't.. ..you speak to me that day? How could I speak to you? Once you start talking then you don't let others speak. Don't know what this mad girl has made me drink. Enough, you've scolded me, enough. Chutku! Chutku! Chutku, see, the era of goodness is no more. I had thought that you will fall at my feet. Be obligated to me. Say that, Sanam, you've changed my life. Instead, you've started scolding me. But, yes, I'll tell you one thing.. ..don't ever show your face to Sanam. Understood? I had thought that he was dumb and went to cure him. But he.. he scolded me so much that, I was dumbfounded. The villagers are right. These foreigners are ungrateful. Be careful, Sanam. For taking revenge.. ..he can attack you anytime, anywhere. Such a loud scream? Sanam.. ..it seems your bones are broken. Killed me! Killed me! Chutku, inform uncle immediately. Sanam's finished. My end is near. - Shall I bring water from the Ganges? Hurry up! Oh, God! Look, nothing has happened to you. Just a few bruises. Few bruises? The noise of the cracking bones deafened me. And you're saying that they're only a few bruises? That noise was due to the pot. The pot broke? You broke my pot? The pot was for collecting honey. Now, neither will I be able to collect honey.. ..nor will I be able to sell it. And neither will I be able to earn money, nor eat. We'll starve to death. - Quiet! Quiet! I'm ready to bear the expenses. Expense.. Rs.50 for my honey, and.. ..Rs.10 for this pot that you broke. How much is 50 and 10? Rs.60. Take it. - Okay. The account is settled. Now, go. I had thought of you to be a fool.. ..but you tricked that soldier so easily. Meaning? There wasn't any honey in that pot. We were going to collect honey.. ..and you charged Rs.60 for a pot? Oh, yes, it means, I charged him Rs.50 extra. And look at that soldier's good nature.. ..he gave us Rs.60, without questioning us. Chutku, we've to return him Rs.50, now. Listen, is Khan Baba there? Khan Baba? Okay, constable Khan Bahadur? He went that way, just now. I won't spare Khan Bahadur today. What does he think of himself? He's been living in.. ..my house for the past seven years. But hasn't paid the rent, yet. What's it, Lala? Why are you boiling like spoilt milk? Has your wife thrown you out of your house? My wife didn't throw me out, I'm going to throw you out of my house. - Why? Because you haven't paid me for the past seven years. House? Which house? Do you call this, ground, these four walls, as a house? - Yes. Just a moment. It was my milk, why did you throw it? There was a fly in it, you would have died. Did I stay on your terrace? - No. Did I stick to these four walls? - No. I stayed on the ground, isn't it? - Yes. And this ground is God's gift. You prove that, you bought this ground from God.. ..and I'll pay your rent. How could I have bought this land from God? This land was bought my grandpa. Then, go and bring your Grandpa. Grandpa? - Yes. - But, he's dead. Okay, then bring the one.. ..from whom your grandpa bought this. Even he's dead. - Then bring the one.. ..from whom he had bought it. Khan, all of them are dead. - All of them are dead? - Yes. Then why are you alive? You too, die. - This is correct. Listen! - Coming! Khan, where are you going? It's my wife, she's calling me. Then, you go. I thought that you.. What a ridiculous fellow. My wife is calling and you're.. - Then, go. Gaurav! - Khan Baba! Indians! - Let it be. How are you? Did you start your training? - Yes. Father.. How's your father? Did he rejoin office? No, Baba. Since then I haven't seen a smile on his face. Have courage, dear. God will set everything right. He'll heal every wound. It's been four days. The soldier hasn't come out of his school. And the problem is that no one can go into his school. I don't understand, how do I return this Rs.50 of his? He must be thinking that.. ...I'm dishonest. - Sanam, if he calls you dishonest.. ..then I'll crack his skull. Chutku, tell me a way to return this money to him. Sanam, outsiders can't go inside. But, soldiers can get in. What do you mean? Sanam, that washer-man in our village". ..washes the clothes of all the soldiers. If you wear one of them.. ..then you too will look like a soldier. Then you too can go in. Left turn! Guards up! About turn! About turn! Soldier, sir! - Who's it? Girl's voice? - Go away from here. - Soldier, sir! Where's the girl? - Girl?! Where's the girl, sir? She's here. I heard her voice, just now. How can a girl come here, sir? That's what even I want to know. But, I surely heard her. Otherwise, after so many years.. ..how could I hear a woman's voice? Soldier, I myself am so worried and you.. Girl! Girl! -Which girl? The girl whom I saw with my own eyes. I'll surely track her down. Soldier, what are you doing to my face? Keep quiet, or else, there'll be a problem. There's definitely a girl here. Soldier, what are you doing? What style of shaving is this? You've held the razor in a wrong manner. I'll help you shave. Soldier, your skin is so soft. Sir! - What is it? You shave so nicely. Were you a barber, before? Shut up! - Don't disturb me while I am at work. Soldier, how did you fix moustache so soon? I didn't fix it, sir. I grew it. You're that same girl. And you've put this moustache in order to save yourself? No! Balwant! What's all this? Sir, he's pulling my moustache. No, sir, this is a girl who's put on a moustache to fool us. What rubbish! Does he look like a girl? He's Dinesh. Why have you come here? Look, don't be furious, you've an oath on Sanam's name. I've an important job with you. You go now, I shall meet you, tomorrow. You're coming now? I've been waiting from such a long time for you. Tell me, what do you want, now? I don't want anything. I have come to return this Rs.50 to you. So, you've understood the calculations? I'm very good at calculations. I'm the most educated girl in the village. I've passed the second grade. Soldier, you look so good when you smile. Why don't you smile always? A man can only smile as much as his fate allows him to. Do you know, Sanam, howl felt about you all these clays? Exactly like your uncle's bitter medicine. But, today, you're look as sweet as your honey. But, how do you know my honey's taste? You've never tasted it. Now tell me, how's it? - Very sweet. But you're much sweeter than it, Sanam. Go away! Promise! Promise! Promise! Promise me and say.. Promise! Promise me.. ...you'll never be upset with your beloved. Promise! Promise me.. ...you'll never be upset with your beloved. How do I keep smiling? You remain naughty and I try to persuade you. How do I keep smiling? You remain naughty and I try to persuade you. You remain naughty and I try to persuade you. Promise! Promise! Promise! Promise me.. ...you'll never be upset with your beloved. I did this by mistake.. ...I didn't know that you were so innocent. I did this by mistake.. I didn't know that you were so innocent. I didn't know that you were so innocent. Promise! Promise! Promise! I promise.. I promise you and say.. Promise! I promise.. ...I'll never be upset with my beloved. I'll never be upset with my beloved. I'm saved! Khan Bahadur! Help me! Khan, where are you going early in the morning.. ..with a bandage around your head? My head is paining, I was going to get some medicine. In these times, medicines shouldn't be consumed. They've side effects. Yesterday night, even my head was aching. But I didn't consume any medicine. - Then? I went to my wife, told her to apply oil on my hair. So, she applied oil on my head. Then she massaged my head, lovingly. And then, I went to sleep, when I got up after one hour.. ..my headache vanished. - What are you saying? I'm telling the truth. Khan! Where are you going? In your house. ls your wife at home? How does her presence concern you? I thought that I too could ask her to massage my head. Khan, first you took over my house.. ..and now you want my wife? Okay, I'll go and buy some medicine. What a weird Khan! I tell him the remedy and he tries to grab my wife? Dare you ever come to my house! He left! I feel like breaking my head with.. ..a stone. But what is the point? The pain won't go with the stone. My head is aching and someone e|se's screaming. It seems that, Lala fell down. Brother Angara. There is curfew in the market too today. There's a curfew in the college as well. What'|| happen to our education? Only education won't put you into the annals of history. The community doesn't get a.. Forget these books. It's the time to lift weapons. It's the only way to attain freedom. Angara, the General's arriving". ..with the weapons, today. Welcome, General. While crossing the border, did you.. ..or your men, face any difficulties? - No. Look. How's it? This seems to be a new model. Only your military as such a gun.. This will help you fulfill your dream of attaining freedom. But, when? When will my Dhanakpur be freed? Very soon. I'm waiting for that day.. ..when due to these weapons.. ..every city, every lane in your country.. ...will be on fire. There will be the silence of death all around. And then you'll break.. .. the bridge and announce your freedom. You can't kill me. I'm your childhood friend. No. I first love my village and its freedom. And in between that freedom, what of a friend.. ..even if my brother comes in the way, I won't spare him alive. I won't spare him alive. Dada, try to understand. This gun was found at the riverbank. Our informer is missing. We're afraid that he must've been killed. This gun is the proof that.. ..our enemies are not only storing these.. ...weapons in your village". ..but also misguiding your youth into becoming anti-nationals. I know that you're playing this trick.. ..so that, a police station can be built in our village.. ..and then, slowly, all Indians can come and settle there. But, Major, I won't let this happen at any cost. I'm the local leader of this area. If you try to take any action.. ..against my will, then I will take.. ..this matter to Delhi. Understood? Major, I'm sure that.. ...General's brother Shera is present here. And I'm sure that.. ..Shera's presence is going to bring about a storm. General! My brother, how are you? Look for yourself. How the enemy's food is improving my health. I'm always worrying about you, Shera. - Nothing will happen to me, General. Until this country is in ruins, and Dhanakpur isn't freed.. ..neither will I die.. ..nor will I fall into the enemy's hands. Tell me, what do I have to do next? I've arranged for a huge stock of ammunitions. And Angara will bring it to you.. ..on the other side of the bridge. This time, you've to spread the ammunition throughout India. Look, Khan, nowadays, you're a little tensed. Your Saturn isn't at the right place. But, within a year, everything will be fine. You will become a king. - Really? There'll only be prosperity for you. All your sorrows will end. You'll be rich too. Okay, then I've to wait for a year.. My fees! - You even take fees. How much? - Rs.5.15 for palmistry. Rs.5.15? That's all? In such costly times.. ..even a beggar doesn't accept Rs.5.15. No, sir, I'll give you Rs.101. Give. - Not now, when my good days come, only then. But.. - What had you said? You said that, my days will be brighter. As soon as my days brighten up, I'll give you your Rs.101. Give me Rs.5.15, at least. I can't insult you by giving you Rs.5.15. No! - But, brother.. Chutku, see what this Khan has made me eat.. ..my stomach has been aching for the past 10 days. Take this, this is a horse's medicine.. ..it will cleanse your stomach. Get lost! How can I eat a horse's medicine? Get some other medicine. - What? Don't do like this! At least buy me a cup of tea. Silent! Silent! Chutku, what are you standing with? Gamma the wrestler is going for a wrestling bout. Gamma the wrestler? Who, this one? Yes, this is for his medicine. Drinking this will strengthen your body. - Really? What if I drink it? Let me drink this. Give it to him. - Shall I? - Yes. Take it. - Thank you. Khan, take this, I'm going. Chutku, what did you give him? This was medicine for the horses. Now, we won't need fertilizers.. ..for our fields for the next two years. He'll be there throughout the day.. ..and at Margatlal doctor's house, tomorrow. Naughty fellow! Take these leaves, and chew them. Okay, Margat, I'm leaving. May God bless you. - Astrologer, sir.. ...I know that it's sinful to ask money from a Brahmin. But, you can give some, yourselves. Dear, where does a Brahmin have money, to give? Yes, but, I can read your palm.. ...tell you what the future has in store for you. Okay, at least pay me in this manner. Sanam, the lines on your palm are saying that, you're in love. Love? That too with a foreigner. Get lost. Astrologer, what are you saying? Love? Foreigner? Don't you know that |ndians.. ..are considered to be foreigners, here? You know, that none of the villagers". ..can have any kind of relationship with an Indian. None of our the girls in this village have ever crossed the bridge.. ..nor will they ever cross it. If this was a joke.. ..then it was a bad one. Now onwards.. ..don't even joke like this, again. This isn't a joke, Margat, this is that.. "truth, which has been written on Sanam's palm. Sanam, don't even look at your reflection like this. You're looking so beautiful that.. ..your could cast an evil eye on yourself. - Go. Really, Sanam. Earlier.. ..when you used to dress on full moon night.. ..but today, even the moon of full moon night.. ...will look bleak in your presence. - Go. Sanam, even if a prince from the skies comes here, today.. ..even he will be astounded by your beauty. Which prince will come to see me? But, yes, if the Goddess sends.. ..the prince whom I want to meet.. ..then the purpose of dressing, will be fulfilled. Why are they playing the drums? ls there a marriage? Today is Full moon night, only on this day.. ..can the village belles cross the bridge. So, they worship the Goddess and celebrate. My heart beats, I feel afraid, dear. I feel shy whenever I see you, dear. My heart beats, I feel afraid, dear. I feel shy whenever I see you, dear. How do I tell you, dear? I don't want to live without you. I don't want to live without you. I don't want to live without you. My heart beats, I feel afraid, dear. I feel shy whenever I see you, dear. How do I tell you, dear? I don't want to live without you. I don't want to live without you. I don't want to live without you. You're colourful, you're lovely.. ..you never say anything, you're too shy. You're colourful, you're lovely.. ..you never say anything, you're too shy. I shall come in your dreams, when you're angry.. ...I shall persuade you, clear. I don't want to live without you. I don't want to live without you. I don't want to live without you. You're my future, you're a beautiful picture. You're the dream that has come true. You're my future, you're a beautiful picture. You're the dream that has come true. I shall rob you of your sleep, I shall astonish you.. ..wake up your sleeping heart, dear. I don't want to live without you. I don't want to live without you. I don't want to live without you. My heart beats, I feel afraid, dear. I feel shy whenever I see you, dear. My heart beats, I feel afraid, dear. I feel shy whenever I see you, dear. How do I tell you, dear? I don't want to live without you. I don't want to live without you. I don't want to live without you. I don't want to live without you. O my dear, you don't know, you are still beautiful and I am young.. Hey Khan! Come over here. No, pal. You get irritated, I won't talk to you. No, I won't get irritated. - No, you get irritated. I won't get irritated this time. Sit down. I'm very happy, today. Do you know, I had visited the city with my wife, yesterday.. ..to watch the circus. An amazing thing happened there. I was filled with pride.. ..an example of bravery was set. Ask why? Ask Why? - Okay, why? My wife hugged the tiger. What's great about that? Even I can do that. Khan, can you hug a tiger? Not a tiger, but I can hug your wife. ls she there? Khan, you go that way, you're always talking about the wrong things. You had called me, I hadn't come of my own. And above that, you get irritated? You hug a tiger, only then will you know. Wasim. - Yes, sir. - You managed to hit only 11 out of 20 shots. You need more practice. - Sir.. Gaurav! - It's our soldiers turn now. Gaurav, where are you looking? Where's your attention? Our soldier is going to lose badly. The pot is somewhere and he's shooting somewhere else. No, Chutku, how can our soldier lose while Sanam is here? Now, you'll see the magic of my catapult. As soon as our soldier presses the triggers.. ..you touch me, that's it. It seems you've practiced firing. Good. I am proud if you. Sanam, you?! It's good to know that, you too, sometimes visit the temple. I thought that you're an atheist. Had I not come to the temple, today, then when could I have come? I've passed the shooting test today. Success has smiled at me for the first time. That's why I've come to thank God. Without God, even a leaf doesn't shake. You should thank him. But, soldier, you should thank me, too. Thank you? -Why? - I was the one who broke all those pots.. ..with my catapult. - What? You had missed your first two shots. That's why, as soon as you shot the gun, I shot my catapult. What happened, soldier? You have done the wrong thing, Sanam. Why does the world think inferior of me? Why does it feel that I can't achieve anything? It's not so, soldier, had I not helped you.. ..then you would have lost. I would have lost. Not died. Soldier, don't say like that, how can I see you lose? After all, I love you. Love? - Yes, soldier, I love you a lot. But, Sanam, I don't love you. Sanam, you're a very nice girl. But I have always thought of you as a friend. If our meetings, our time together.. ..has made you fall in love with me.. ..then remove that love from your heart. Because it's futile to dream for something that's unattainable. As I have no place for love, in my life, Sanam. What has happened to Sanam these days? Chutku, what has happened to you? Are you in good health? I don't know what has happened to me, uncle. Neither peace in the day, nor sleep in the night. I don't even feel hungry. I remain lost in thoughts, all clay. This happens only in youth, that too after falling in love with someone. Chutku, how come you've fallen in love at this age? Love? What's the remedy for this? At least, tell me that. This is a deadly disease. The remedy for this, is available only with that person.. ..whom one loves. It's such a deadly disease.. ..that even a doctor doesn't have a cure for it. Sanam, I know what has happened to you.. ..you've fallen in love with that soldier. Yes, Chutku. - Don't cry, you don't look good, crying. Even I don't like it. Without soldier.. ..everything appears barren. Do you know? He's going to the.. ..snowy areas with his friends for four days. I will die without seeing him. I'll die. Ghost! What are you saying, Chutku? Where we're going, is there a ghost there? Yes, you've 11 fingers on your hand, they won't spare you. 11?! No, I've just 10 fingers. Not 10, but 11. Count. Okay, 1.. 2.. 3.. 4.. 5.. 6.. 7.. 8.. 9.. 10. Now, count it anti-clockwise. - 10.. 9.. 8.. 7.. 6. 6and5? -11. 6 and 5.. 11?! Chutku, I've 11 fingers. What will I do if.. ..the ghosts kill me? What'|| you do? The ghost will do whatever it has to. It'll bite you here, and all your blood will come out. You're such a fat man, it'll satisfy.. ..the hunger of three-four ghosts. - No. You were saying that Sanam.. ..knows how to get rid of ghosts. She knows, but why? I've to take the boys over there. You send Sanam with me, my life will be spared. Please! Dear, nowadays, you neither talk nor laugh. You are lost in your thoughts, always. What's happened to you? I'll tell you what's happened to her. What's happened? - She's missing her aunt. How long it's been, since aunt last visited us. Yes. She wants to go to aunt's place. Okay, so you want to go to aunt's place? Foolish girl, why didn't you tell me, earlier? Pack your belongings, I'll drop you at aunt's place. Uncle, you're going to take her to aunt's place? 200-300 patients will die in two days. ls she a kid? She can go by herself. I'll drop her till the bus-stop. Why are you standing here? Pack up, fast. If you delay, then you'll miss the bus. It's too cold here. There's ice all over the place. There isn't any sign of land. Where will we stay over here? I've arranged for our stay in the village below. But we'll train here. Gaurav! - Yes, sir. - Get two-three tents from the bus. - Okay, sir. Come on boys, come on. Hurry up! Listen, give me the tents. You? Why have you come over here? Even the sky doesn't have any use on this earth.. ..but it's still here. I've told you about my problems, earlier itself, Sanam. But you didn't listen to my problems, soldier. The place where I've grown up since birth.. ..it seems barren to me. I don't like to stay there. I feel like dying, when I don't see you. That's why I came here. And, yes, I've promised Chutku that.. ...I'll return only after embossing my name on your heart. My back is paining due to such hard work. Shall I tell you something, aunt? Only your back is paining, but there.. "Uncle's heart must be aching. After all, you've left him alone over there. Yes, he must have gone crazy. Even at this age, he won't stay without me. God knows what must've happened to him. What's there to happen, aunt? He will be found tearing his clothes.. ..in a few more days. Think of your husband.. ..how happy he was when he saw you in the bus. He was feeling happy even when he was crying. Girl, are you trying to see your reflection in your palms? Oh, God! You've been working so hard that.. ..there are boils all over your palm. Let it be, aunt. I've come here to change my future. You don't seem to be a |abourer.. ..what's the compulsion that's brought you here? I have come because of my heart. I've come here to write my name on a stony heart. You useless fellows, hurry up. If you reach late, then the major.. ...will court martial me, along with you. Oh, God. - Manjit, what are you doing? - I'm taking bath, sir. What kind of a bath is this? - Not only him. We all are planning to bathe like this, sir. It's very cold here. - Useless fellow, we're soldiers. Heat or cold holds no significance for us. Let me see how cold it is. What happened, sir? Why have your fingers become crooked? Soldier, it isn't crooked, they've.. ..become numb due to the cold. What happened, Gaurav? Have your fingers gone numb, too? No, sir, they've got burnt. The water is too hot. It's hot?! Yes. What's this? We don't even get to drink hot tea, over here. And you're getting hot water to bathe? Ghost! I haven't even ironed my shirts. What's this? Gaurav's shirt has been ironed. Gaurav, when did you iron your shirts? Gaurav, even your shoes are polished. When did you do all this? - I don't know. I was bathing with you all. - Whether you believe me or not. I think there's a female ghost after you. Who's doing everything for you? Shut up! Idiot! We've come here to train.. ..and you're concerned about ghosts. Believe me, sir. There are ghosts here. If you talk about ghosts again.. ..then I'll get you court-martialed. Good morning, sir. What have you done to yourself? Have you got drunk early in the morning? Not at all, sir, this is the hangover of last night's drink. The effect hasn't thinned, yet. Balwant, you stay with him tonight. See to it that, he doesn't drink. You're watching over me and drinking, yourself? Shut up! Major has asked me to watch over you. He hasn't told me not to drink, understood? Quietly go to sleep. - Okay, I'll go to sleep. How did this glass get empty? ls there a ghost here? Dear ghost, he's there, inside. He's sleeping. I'm still awake. - What's the matter, sir? Why are you sweating in this cold weather? It seems there's a ghost here. Ghosts are just an illusion, sir. There isn't anything called ghosts in this world, sir. Look at me, am I afraid of ghosts? Now, go to bed. Wait! Wait, soldier, drink this. Drink this. Look soldier. Don't commit such atrocity. Don't leave me alone. Please sleep in my tent, tonight It seems I won't be able to sleep without alcohol". ..let me arrange for a drink. Come! Come! The fool has slept. You wait here. Sir, what are you doing? I'm preparing to guard myself. I won't spare the ghost if he comes here. I'll shoot him. What have I done! Shamsher Singh! Instead of a ghost, I've killed a human. I killed my own cook. What are you saying? I'll be caught. I'll be hanged for committing a murder. See, what has happened, has happened. No one other than me has seen you commit the murder. Let's get some clothes". ..and wrap this corpse and throw it into the valley. Some animal will eat him till the morning. Which animal will eat him? Some unfortunate animal will eat him. Come. You were a burden when you were alive.. ..you're a burden, even after your death. I feel pity for that animal that will eat you. It'll die, then and there. Slowly, at least respect his corpse. Shamsher Singh, goodbye! Shamsher Singh, goodbye! Where is my tent? Soldier, we've thrown that corpse. But, will that cook come to take a revenge on us.. ..in the form of a ghost? Ghost! The cook has become a ghost! What nonsense are you speaking, sir? Where's he? Look over there. - There's no one there. When I was looking, he was there. Come, I'll show you. It's all your imagination, sir. It's not my imagination. - You don't know.. There is no such thing as ghosts. Do I get scared of ghosts? Sir? Where's sir? He went to sleep, leaving me alone? I too shall go to sleep. So, you're sleeping here? I had told you, sir, that the cook is dead. Then how can his ghost come here? Soldier. - Yes sir? I'm standing here, who's that sleeping over there.. ..with whom you're talking? Sir, I'm talking to.. What happened? I'll tell you.. - This is the cook's ghost. He's dead. No, I'm alive, I haven't died. If you hadn't died, then why did you scare us, as a ghost? Hit him! Thrash him! Come on. Move! Move! Fire! Gaurav, where's your attention? If you do this again, then I'll punish you hard. Now get HP! Why? Didn't you like this dish? This isn't your house, this is a camp.. ..everyone here will eat the same food. Go, stand hungry over there, till the evening. Come on, move. Sanam, come, let's eat. - No, you eat. I'm not feeling hungry. Soldier, scold me if you want to, but, don't remain hungry. Look, Sanam, there's a fire burning within me. I may not be able to tell you everything. But, understand one thing, if you keep interfering like this.. ..then I won't be able to attain my goal. You're an obstacle in my path. I will never fall in love with you.. And, from today, I won't even utter your name.. Look, the reply to my love letter has arrived. Look.

So, ask a local to accompany you. This department is mine, I know whom to be sent and when.. ..very nicely. Sanam! - Yes, sir? Sanam, you go the market with Gaurav. Sir, listen, buy this cloth. There's a lot of variety. Buy one for your wife.. ...It'll look good on her, she's so fair. She isn't my wife. - If she isn't your wife.. ..then she'll become one, after wearing this. I don't want your cloth. - Okay, don't buy it today.. ..but tomorrow, you'll come searching for me.. ..to buy this cloth. Gaurav, where are you going? - To the camp. It's risky to go any higher, today. There's a threat of a storm. You stay here, today. You can go there in the morning, tomorrow. What are you looking at? I've made the bed, go to sleep. You'll sleep here? - Where else will I sleep? The bed is here, will I sleep in the jungle? You should be ashamed.. ..you're trying to sleep with an unknown man. Who's unknown? You? I've accepted you as my own, a long time back. What do you want? - I only want you. But I don't want you. Why? Why don't you like me? Look in to my eyes, can't you see love in it? Feel my heart, doesn't it utter your name, with every beat? Captain, I had a very good life. After I met you, I'm totally ruined. I was so happy with my family.. "but, I'm here now. And you say it so easily that, you don't love me. What should I do to get you? Should I tear my heart and show it to you? Tell me? Give me an answer. What do I lack? You don't lack anything, it's my fate. I don't have any rights over my life. I'll tell you everything, today. We'll not spare you today. I don't know anything. What's happening? - Madam, One of our lunches is stolen everyday. Nobody other than him can do it. Look at him, he's looks like a thief. I'm a poor man, and a poor man either looks like a beggar.. ..or like a thief. I'm telling the truth, I haven't stolen anybody's lunchbox. Then where does the food go? Listen! - What? What are you doing? I'm eating your boiled, dull, bad tasting food. This is the height of shamelessness. Being the boss.. ..you're stealing the food of your staff? I wasn't stealing. I had thought that, I will eat, then I'll tell everybody. The doctor has warned you not to eat these things. The doctors will say like that, just to boost their business. I got bashed up because of you. You don't worry. Sorry. I won't tolerate their cruelty, anymore. Tomorrow, my hero is returning from London. What? Brother is coming? - My son, Naren is coming? Yes, my hero is coming. How are you, dad? - I'm fine. How are you? I used to miss you a lot, dad. - Naren. Even your mother and brother have come to receive you. Oh, mother! God bless you. Brother! Dad, what happened to you? Why are you hanging upside down? They'll show about the budget on the TV. Look what's happened to this TV, it's seems to be overturned. Why do you do like that, dad? Dad, I'll repair this TV immediately. Do you know to repair a TV? - Dad, there's nothing that I can't do. Give me Rs.500. - Rs.500? What for? Think about it, dad. They'll be showing the budget in a few moments. Okay, fine. Here, take Rs.500. - This is Rs.50. It's Rs.100! - We had agreed on Rs.500. Okay, fine. Take it. He kept failing in math, throughout his education. But is very precise with monetary calculations. Here, clad. Your TV will be alright now. After watching the budget, ask a TV mechanic to repair it. Cheater! You cheated me into paying you Rs.500. Dad, this is my knowledge's earning, it's not by cheating. Ok, bye, dad. - Even I had this kind of a hair.. ..once upon a time. It used to sway when I walked. It's not possible. - I'll show you the photo in the evening. Come early in the evening. We shall play carom. Whiskey with lot of ice. Sir, the doctor has asked you not to drink alcohol. Silent! That's why I drink it like this" ..so that no one knows of it. Get lost from here. He hasn't come yet, today. I won't sleep until he comes back, today. Brother! Dad's very angry. He's been waiting for you. What do I do? My friend's didn't let me come. Do one thing, go and sleep. Here's your night suit. Pagliya.. Dad's thinking of brother as a mirror. Before he catches him, bring the mirror from my room. Thank you. - Okay, dad. Or this will break. I've caught hero! I won't spare him! What are you doing? Why are you fighting with a mirror? It isn't a mirror. It's hero. - But dad, how can it be brother? Brother has been sleeping in his room for a long time. What is it, dad? You? - When did you come back home? I came back in the evening itself, dad. I was tired, that's why I went to sleep. Why, dad? Nothing. It seems I had too much whisky. You go and sleep. Good night. - Good morning. - Good morning. Has hero woken up? Yes. He's preparing for his exercise. Exercise! Trainer, increase the weight. Thank you! Dad, what's this? - I'm preparing to go to the Olympics. You don't know, our country hasn't won a medal in weightlifting, yet. That's why, the president has requested.. ...me to participate in the Olympics". ..and lift the country's honour. I mean, save the country's honour. But, dad. So much weight! 600 kilograms? This is nothing, I've lifted even more weight in my youth. This is nothing, dear. - But, dad. Stand there quietly and learn about how to become a world champion. Vitamins please. Only half glass of vitamins? No, problem, I've exercised less. Good. Go. How did dad suddenly change from a businessman, into a He-man? Listen! What's this all about? - Sir, I'm poor.. ..but not a traitor, I can't betray my master. Here, the price for your honesty. Sir, all this is for showing off in front of you. Actually, all these weights are false. They're wooden, but colored like iron weights. It isn't 600kgs, but Skgs. Okay, you 9°- Now, we'll make dad exercise with real weights. You please go. Mr. Universe, we will like to train with you. Because we want to have a hand in your success. Okay. If you insist. No problem. Help! What? Increase? - Yes, dad wants us to increase the weight. Help! Come on. Let's allow dad to exercise. Brother, something is burning. Dad! Get up. What happened, dad? You've become a child from a champion. Come, I'll take you home. Dad! You? Why? Don't I look like your elder brother? I've stopped dressing up, so that you don't look bleak in my presence. There isn't anything that you can do, and I can't. ls that so? You can't comb. - Okay! You've to comb your hair. Whether it's on your head or your face. Now, tell. - There's something in you, dad. What happened? Dad, can we have a race? Your car and my jeep? My motorcycle is enough to beat you. That junk? - That's the one, on which I started my job as a salesman. Because of that motorcycle, I have such a big bungalow today. Do you know what the people used to call that motorcycle? - What? Aeroplane! Dad, if you say that your bike is an aerop|ane.. ..then will I believe it? - Only time will tell, clear. Hey - Yes! Pull out that motorcycle. ls there petrol in it? Why? Do you want to set fire to it? Not fire, dear. I have to race with you. Dad! Mummy, there will be chaos in the city, today. Why don't you stop dad? He behaves like a kid when he sees brother. Yes, dear. His childhood returns when your brother returns home. It's because, he hasn't seen his childhood, when he was a child. At an age, when other children play with toys.. ..your father used to carry loads around, in the railway station. The child in him that had died under the burden of poverty.. ..returns with Naren. You tell me, how do I stop him? Are you taking a shortcut? Didn't you see the board outside? I saw the board, but I'm in a hurry. Are you going for a marriage with this umbrella? Show me your license. License? My driver has it. - Driver?! You've a driver for this bike? The driver isn't for my motorcycle, he drives my Mercedes. That car, that costs Rs.50-60 lakhs? Yes, that one. Do you have that car? What do you think of yourself? Seth (sir) Yashpal Anand? I am Seth Yashpal Anand. It seems that he's drunk, come to the police station. Do you plan to sleep on the table? Stand straight. Constable, what has he done? - Sir, he's committed four crimes. First, he's driving a junk without a license. Second, he got into a no-entry zone and third, he's drunk. And the biggest crime, he thinks of.. ...himself as Seth Yashpal Anand. - What? Seth Yashpal Anand! You loafer, look at yourself. He's the richest man in the city. Even his servants would be better looking than you. Dare you misbehave with me, you don't know what I can do. It seems he knows the local MLA. Constable! Yes, sir. - Not you, you're from the traffic dept. Constable! Throw him in. - Just a moment. I'll go myself. Seth Yashpal Anand! Rogue! What have you been arrested for? Have you picked someone's pocket? In a no-entry. - Hi, dad. You're here? - Hero, you are here, too? What did you do? Like you, I too, entered a no-entry zone, I was caught. You wanted to win by cheating? Did you get into a no-entry for winning honestly? - Shut up! But, how'|| we get out? I've called the lawyer, he must be on his way. Naren. Yashpal, sir! You're here? In jail? ls he Seth Yashpal in reality? Yes. And you put him in the lockup? Constable, hurry up and open the door, he's actually a Seth. Dad.. - Thank you. Move aside! Forgive me, sir. I couldn't recognise you. Inspector, this can go up to Delhi.- But, sir, you were the one at fault. The matter goes up to Delhi, only when I'm at fault. But, sir, you are such a rich man.. ..then why do you dress like a loafer? And you were caught driving a junk?! I didn't understand it. I was racing with Hero.. Where's that cheat? - Which cheat? I'm here. Not you, my son, Naren. - He went away long back. - He went? It means, the race too went out of my hands. Hero. I'm your father. I won't let you win so easily. I've won! I've won! Dad, you lost and I won. Okay, ask what you want. Dad, you stop smoking. Neither secretly, nor when alone.. ..and neither by hiding it in your pen. Dad, your life is precious to me. If something happens to you.. ..then what'|| happen to me? For you, I can give up my life, what big thing is this cigarette. Today onward, for your sake, I shall stop smoking. Anything else? Careful! You'll come under the car. Careful! Hey! Stop! What's this? It's a car, sir. - Car? What kind of a car is this? Where's its seat and flooring? This isn't a car, this is the honour of India. Honour of India?! - Yes, sir. Do you remember.. ..that petrol used to cost Rs.4 per liter, once upon a time? Yes. In that time, my father didn't give me a house, but he gave me this car. He said, dear son, live in this car, comfortably, throughout your life. What's this? This is the car's horn, sir. So, I was talking about petrol. Sir, the price of petrol increased.. ...so much, that I removed the seat and the flooring.. ..and started pushing it around. You seem to be a fraud. Let's see what you've hidden in your bonnet. Where's the engine? When the inflation rates ate the whole of lndia.. ..then can't my car eat that small engine? If I can't buy petrol, then what's the use of having an engine? It's an unnecessary burden on my car. If you've so many problems, then why do you travel in this car? Why don't you walk? I had heard that in the city, there's a place for pedestrians.. ..what's it's name? I forgot.. Footpath. Yes, may God bless you. Footpath. So, is there anything called a footpath here? No, it isn't there. - Yes. In place of the footpath, there're slums, shops, pits, beggars. And the remaining places have been dug up by the municipality. It seems as if they've dug the. graves for people who haven't been born yet In fact, I fell into such a pit, once. They even buried me there. It was God's grace that the telephone.. ...people dug it up once again and pulled me out. Else I would've still been inside that. If you come to this city once again then surely meet me. Why, sir? - Because on seeing you, today.. ...I felt as if I saw the whole of India. Brother Khan! How are you? I'm absolutely fine, but what's happened to this Gaurav? Now you only make him understand. I'm tired of reasoning with him. What's the matter, dear? What to say, Khan Baba? I study so much.. ...I work so hard, yet, I manage to pass only by second class. And look at brother's cups and medals.. ..brother always comes first and me, second class. These things, Hero's got them in schools and colleges". ..remember one thing, life tests everyone and the one who.. ..is successful in that, only he's known as the real hero. Baba, I've joined the NDF. And I'm coming to your area for training. You've done a good job, dear. In fact, military is such a training that.. ..can show you the right direction. The truth is that, we've our hopes pinned on you, youth. Do something that will increase the respect for our country.. ..in the eyes of the world. Good morning, dad. There's a function for the ex-students of our college. And I've promised them that I'll give them a donation of Rs.25 lakhs. Don't talk about donations. And go from here, I'm doing an important job. Please, clad, Give me or else I'll lose my honour. You want to save your honour? Yes, dad. Now, tell me. Will you play with me? Over here? In the office? How will we play here? Don't worry about that, here goes the file, here's the other one. Take this. Just a moment. The curtains. Take the bat. And here's the net. Ready, dad? - Just a moment. Okay. Whatever you say, it's only hard work that brings success. Now, look at our sir. He's been working since 11am in the morning.. ...It's going to be 1 pm, now. And he hasn't even asked for water. Work! Work! Listen, please find out. It's going to be 3pm.. "I've an urgent job with sir. Do you want me to lose my job? How many times should I tell you? Sir's is attending to an important job, inside. Sir hasn't eaten yet? - No, madam. There's a board outside. Sir, is busy with his work. Important job? Mom, where's brother? Don't know, even Hero's missing since morning. Mother, maybe they're doing this important job together. Nita, I was explaining to him that.. ..the manufacturing of the table-tennis ball.. I was doing my job properly". ..when this fool came.. ..and asked me whether I want to play table-tennis. He brought the ball too. How many times have I told you that playing table-tennis.. ..makes my hands shiver. Hero, you're the first child in this world who's spoiling his father. Yes, I was telling the same thing. He gets spoilt as soon as you arrive. I've told you not to do these things. Nita, this isn't our house, this is the office. Leave me. Okay, come home, I'll teach you a lesson. Come on, Gaurav. - Hero! Don't be upset. I was trapped, I had to do all this. You're my dear little son. I'm tired of this woman, always pulling my ears.. ..lifting me by the collar. I'm thinking of declaring war against her. - War? But, how? I'll tell you something out of experience. A man can never fight against a woman. Yes, if there's another woman in this house.. ..then she can fight against her. - In the house? It means, dad, you'll marry again at this age? I'm not talking about myself. I'm talking about.. take this slap. I'm talking about you. About whom? - About you. Look, they're two. Your mother and Gaurav. And we're two, as well. Now, if you get married, then we become three. And then you'll have kids.. ..and then our team will keep increasing. Do you have affair with any girl? I feel shy to tell you, her name. - ls it? I'll sing her name to you in the college function.. ..and you can go and talk to her. Promise? - Promise. I saw a dream yesterday. Rekha was in my arms. I saw a dream yesterday.. Rekha was in my arms. My heart's so crazy, that it keeps twinkling. Twinkle, twinkle. When I saw her, I lost my sleep. I'm Karishma's fan. It's difficult to live without her.. "gentle, beautiful, Raveena. Raveena, Raveena, Raveena. She's a flame and I'm a kite.. I'm so mad for her, I'll, one day, get Juhi Chawla. Chawla, Chawla, Chawla. She's fire, and I'm colourful. She sets everything on fire, she's Urmila. Aishwarya robs my peace.. ..Tabu keeps me awake all night. Tabu, Tabu, Tabu. She's so stylish, she's precious. Sweet and simple, she's Kajol. There's no one like her, she's one among thousands, Puja. Puja, Puja, Puja. Sushmita, Rambha, Mamata, Nagma.. ..they gave me a shock in love. Shilpa, shot me.. ...I was looted, poor lover.

Sir, these are not the girls. These are not the girls? - Yes, sir. They are heroines. Since you don't watch movies you don't know him. These girls can't marry our Hero. I don't have any affair with any girl. Ok then. I've selected a very nice girl for you. One of my friends Mr. Bajaj is staying in Poona. His daughter Sapna. I've never seen such a beautiful girl in my life. It seems God has created her in his free time. I mean on holiday. You mean she's beautiful than me? - Mummy? Your mummy is nothing. She's nothing. - I see.. If you make them stand together.. ..your mother will look like a servant. Mom! - Yes. I always used to tell you not to fight with dad. You've invited trouble. - What happened? What happened? Go and hear it yourself. Then you'll know. Beautiful, well educated, beautiful. Hero! Yes, dad. You can say that with her steps.. ...we'll have a blossomed season in the house. We'll have happiness all around. But can she cook like mummy? Your mummy doesn't know to cook except boiled food. And this girl? Wow! She makes such a delicious food that.. ..we feel like tasting the fingers along with the food. ls that so? - Yes, you can consider that this girl.. ..is much better than your mother in every ways. Then whether it is a question of food or singing. Once if this girl will marry in our house.. ..life will be so full of love and fun. Hero.. Your life will be really full of love. Your life has become hell with me, isn't it? That's why it'll be full of love with her. You please tell me is this the reward of my service to you.. ..from so many years? Are you bringing a co-wife in this house? Co-wife? Yours? Have you gone mad? And that's why you've brought this knife for me? I was praising your to be daughter-in-law.. You brave woman, I was talking about Hero's marriage. Stupid, is this the way to make fun? Your daddy is right. You must get marry. It'll do away with my loneliness. Tell me when will you come with us to see the girl? Why to see a girl? Dad has already seen the girl.. ..if he liked her then I too like her. No, you must see a girl. Look, hero. You always win game with me. But this time you can bet I only will win. You'll loose your sense with the sight of that girl. I can bet this. Let's do something. We'll leave right now. We'll be at Poona by night. Come on. Why did you stop the car, Hero? I'm driving from last two hours, dad. Shall I drive now? - No, dad. I'm feeling thirsty. Let's bring some cold drink.

You've ditched me. You've ditched me in your entire life but.. ...I didn't tell you anything. What did you do this with me? Did you left me alone and went away? You wanted to ditch me here.. ..and even there you wished to ditch me? At least you should have given me chance to ditch you there. Why did you leave me and go? No, Gaurav! - No, mom! I can't see daddy crying this way. Let him cry. I've only lost my son and you've lost your.. ..brother. But he has lost everything. Hero.. Sir, I wanted your signature on some papers. Here it's, sir. Sir, it's been a month that you've not come to the office. I'm not feeling well, Sudhir. What's this, sir? You didn't even read the papers. Till today, you've never signed anything without reading. Its okay, Sudhir. I trust you. And what can anybody snatch away from me.. What's the use of this property that couldn't save my son? Okay, sir. I'm leaving. Please listen to me. These days, I'm noticing that.. ..you've started smoking extensively. What will happen if I won't smoke? I'll live few more years. But for whom shall I live? The one for whom I was living has left me forever. Are you going, Gaurav? Mom, what has happened? If God had to kill then why he didn't kill me? What difference it would have made to anybody? But.. but, brother.. Daddy loved brother a lot. Why didn't I die instead of him? No, my child. Please don't say this. Have patience. God will do everything right. Mom, you really believe in God, right? Then pray for him that now I'll come in front of daddy only.. ..when I'll become something in life. That's why I've come here. To become something. I've to prove myself at my mother. I have to bring the smile back on my daddy's dimmed face. And you're the hurdle for me. You love me a lot, don't you? Then mind something. If you come in front of me from today onwards.. ...I'll kill myself. I'll commit suicide. I'm going back to my camp. - Captain! Captain! My child, you did this very right that.. ..you brought him to my house. Uncle! Uncle, his hand is so cold. The intoxication of craziness.. ..can never be done away in the entire life. The intoxication of craziness.. ..can never be done away in the entire life. May our life pass after the prayer for loyalty! The pinning of this crazy heart may be useful to you. My child, now he's out of danger. Really, uncle? - You've been awakening for the entire night. Now you too go and take some rest. No, uncle. Now I'll take your leave. He has warned me not to come in front of him. If he'll see me here he might not do.. ..anything wrong in angriness. You please don't tell him that I had brought him here.. ...safely from that storm. My dear, have you regained consciousness? Now, take this hot milk. You've really obliged me by saving my life. I've just sheltered you in this house. Otherwise somebody else has saved your life. I had told you this before, my dear. That I deal in love and not money. I'd never sell my ‘Chunni’ to the one.. ..who doesn't have love in his heart. Now I've lots of love in my heart. Lots of. Then you please give me the proof.. ..that you love that girl. Oh, God! Did you get the proof or want me to give you more? My sweetheart.. My sweetheart.. My sweetheart.. My sweetheart.. My Lord, in love.. My Lord, I don't know what I could have done in love.. My Lord, I don't know what I could have done in love.. ..if I hadn't loved you perhaps I'd have died. If I hadn't loved you perhaps I'd have died. My Lord, in love.. My Lord, I don't know what I could have done in love.. ..if I hadn't loved you perhaps I'd have died. If I hadn't loved you perhaps I'd have died. I was crazy and madly in love. I was so crazy for you. I had considered you mine. I had detached from the world. I was just a blank paper. You were my love story. My heart felt thirsty for you. You were my life. There's no life without you. There's no life without you. My Lord, in love.. My Lord, I don't know what I could have done in love.. ..if I hadn't loved you perhaps I'd have died. If I hadn't loved you perhaps I'd have died. How do I tell you, how my.. ..nights were passing without you? I used to get lost in dreams and used to talk with you. There was no other name on my lips without you. I used to feel restlessness. I never felt relax anywhere. Wherever you're. I'm there. Wherever you're. I'm there. My Lord, in love.. My Lord, I don't know what I could have done in love.. ..if I hadn't loved you perhaps I'd have died. If I hadn't loved you perhaps I'd have died. Chutku! Chutku! I went to the captain.. No need to say anything. Your scarf is telling me everything. First, you tell me. Was there any letter from aunt? If any letter had come, I'd have left all the dogs.. ..of our village after the postman. Aunt! - Sanam! My dear, were you going somewhere? Yes, aunt. Actually" - What's wrong with you? Now what to say, aunt? There was a problem. Good that you've come here to meet her. Otherwise, Sanam was coming to you. I hope everything is fine. Everything is fine. But, uncle has gone mad. What? - Yes, he's speaking nonsense. Now see, you met Sanam just now, right? But he'll think that Sanam was with you from last four days. No! - He's getting severe mental attacks. He just can't hear anything aloud. He just runs to bite it. - Oh, God! What happened, Chutku? Why are you running like this? ls the street dog following you? Uncle aunt! - Phulva? - Yes, uncle. Aunt has gone mad. What? - She's speaking anything nonsense. Now you only tell me. Sanam was with her since.. ..the last four days, wasn't she? - Yes. But she feels that she met Sanam just now. Sanam was telling that she gets severe mental attacks. She just can't hear anything aloud. She just runs to bite anybody. - Oh, God! I'm sure he must have had some wrong medicine. Oh, God! - What happened? - Aunt has come. Don't speak in a loud voice. She gets severe mental attacks. She just can't hear anything aloud. She just runs to bite anybody. Uncle, sit down. He just can't hear anything aloud. He just runs to bite it. Nothing. Nothing. Nothing. Nothing. Brother, Sanam was with me from last four days. I know you met Sanam just now in the village. Thank God. Love is a very nice feeling, my dear. Only Sanam (love) was missing in your life.. ..and you've got that too. Now, you just see. Your life also will change. Okay. I'll leave now. The bridge will also close down now. Wait, Sanam! Wait for some more time. I really live in these few moments of my life. If it's possible for me, I'll spend my entire life.. ..sitting in front of you. But what to do? Sun is very punctual in setting too. Not punctual. It comes before time. When you're with me.. time just runs speedily. And when you're not around. I just can't pass the time. Go, Sanam. These eyes will wait for you even tomorrow. Neither sleep in eyes nor is there patience in heart. Neither sleep in eyes nor is there patience in heart. This love is also very strange, my dear? This love is also very strange, my dear? Sometime restlessness and sometimes eagerness. Sometime restlessness and sometimes eagerness. This love is also very strange, my dear? This love is also very strange, my dear? Pinch is felt, thirst is experienced.. ..and memories makes me restless. Some strange feeling attracts me towards it.. ..for all the day and night. Pinch is felt, thirst is experienced.. Some strange feeling attracts me towards it.. ..for all the day and night. Nights sets and sunlight appears. It brings the morning. Heart resides in the house of love. Why is this restlessness, my love? Eyes are open but we're sleeping. What's this intoxication of heart for all the time? Neither sleep in eyes nor is the patience in heart. Neither sleep in eyes nor is the patience in heart. This love is also very strange, my dear? This love is also very strange, my dear? I just can't forget you for a single moment. My love, I come rushing to you. I just can't forget you for a single moment. My love, I come rushing to you. If you say I'd break all the customs. I can leave this entire world for you. Neither the night nor the day passes. How will my life pass without you? Anybody falls in love only once in a life. Neither sleep in eyes nor is the patience in heart. Neither sleep in eyes nor is the patience in heart. This love is also very strange, my dear? This love is also very strange, my dear? Sometime restlessness and sometimes eagerness. Sometime restlessness and sometimes eagerness. This love is also very strange, my dear? This love is also very strange, my dear? Shut up! You've said a lot to defend Sanam. Do you mean to say Angara is lying? He has seen your niece flirting with that army officer. I told you we'd meet tomorrow. Now please let me go. - Promise? - Promise. It's better for you that she gets convinced. Within seven days get her married to any boy from.. ..our village. And till she won't get married.. She won't go to the other side of the bridge. Neither will she meet that army officer. Dada, why did you object for.. ..Sanam and Gaurav's meeting? Because she wants to marry in a.. "Locality which we wish to part with. We wish to part from India and wish our freedom. You're dreaming of partition since long. But, you can see the result of that dream. Your corpses are lying in the streets unclaimed and rotten. How many more corpses you wish to slay down here? How many more deaths do you want? Dada, a mother can happily tolerate the.. ..pain during her child's birth. But his death's pain? She just breaks down. She can't tolerate. Have you ever noticed how many changes.. ..took place in our area since the last ten years? The farm that used to produce rose flowers.. "today, you can see blood spots there. Poor do not have the proper meal. They are just dreaming of a food. There's no income source left now. Tourists have stopped coming. Have you seen the school going students or collegians? They have picked up the guns instead of books. What will be their future? Have you ever thought about it? You're educated, sir. You must have read in the newspaper. How the rest of the part of our country is progressing. But, what have we achieved? Where are we? Near to the destruction? Step ahead with the country. Only then we'll see some progress. Don't deal in our motherland being carried away.. ..by other's prompting. Don't deal in our motherland. One more thing, sir. I've considered.. ..Gaurav's mother to be my sister. Gaurav is my son. Gaurav belongs to Sanam. And no force of this world can separate them. But, he'll marry her only when you'll permit Sanam.. ..and like your own daughter.. ..when you'll bring her to the other side of the bridge. You must do this. Mind well. What are you thinking, dada? Today, Khan has said a big thing. Today, his speech has directly affected my heart. Captain! Captain! My dear, go and take your parents permission. If they agree then it's my promise that I'll.. ..bring Sanam to the other side of this bridge. All our weapons are hiding on the other side of the bridge. You please go and take it out tonight itself. I wish to make our weapons reach in every corner.. ..of this country within this week. Dada has permitted one girl to marry.. ..and go to the other side of the bridge. Tomorrow, this bridge can also be left open for the outsiders. And if that will happen then the advantage that we were.. ..taking till now from these foolish people's customs.. ..and traditions will not be possible in future. My efforts of so many years and dreams will go in vain. And, I'll never let that happen. So we must do everything tonight itself. You're under arrest. Bad news for you, Gaurav. The enemy from the other side of the border.. ...has captured Dhanakpur village". ..and has kept dynamite on the bridge. Along with the villagers, Sanam too is in their custody. Enemy has threatened that if General's brother Shera.. ..and his consignment isn't released then.. ..he won't let any of the villagers alive. What are you saying, General? When nobody remains alive then whom will we give.. ..the freedom? to - You're very innocent. We're not concerned with your freedom. We had come to part this nation. You've welcomed strangers to your house. So you must pay for it. You're right. A traitor like me must be punished. But General, Angara (blaze) is such that it.. ..can alight others too along with itself. You traitor, if you dare to touch any of the villagers". ...I'll kill you. Leave me. You betrayer! Fraudulent! You, rogue! Don't hit my child. Please let go off him. Today onward, I'll send one dead body to your.. ..government. I'll see how long they.. ..keep my brother in jail? Do you know who will die first? Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Don't shoot! They have villagers with them. Don't shoot! Cassette? There must be some message in this. Brave and confident soldiers of India. If my brother won't be released then.. ...I'll make a pool of blood her. If my condition isn't be accepted I'll send.. ..one dead body daily. Look at the face of the person to die today evening. Captain, I don't know whether you're there or not? If you're then before death accept my last salutation. I'm regret only one thing. That I could have been able to see you once before dying. Major Khan, here are the orders of Shera's release. Didn't I tell you? You can't lock the storm in jail. What will you punish me? I very well know the.. ..weakness of you Indians. You can just talk big. Nobody can do anything to me. Leave it. - What are you doing? Leave it. I said leave my pistol. Leave! - Move! Stop there. - Just throw that pistol. No, sir. I've been punished for hang till death.. ..for murdering four landlords. They had just captured.. ..my farms. But this fool wants to capture my country. He wants to part my country. If General will come to know about Shera's death.. ..he will destroy entire Dhanakpur. What will happen with Sanam? Gaurav will save her. - Gaurav? He can't even aim properly. How will he save Sanam? What are you thinking of Gaurav? Do you remember I had told you once.. ..that life tests us? Today, life is testing you. This same life gives one chance to everybody. To prove himself. In your words. To be a hero. Today life is giving you chance to be a hero. Your Sanam is trapped there. You must go and save her. And not only Sanam.. ..but all our Indian brothers trapped in enemy's cage. You must save them all. Go and show the enemy today.. ..that we Indians surely believe in non-violence. But we're not cowardly. We're not timid. Our blood also can fight. Our blood is also full of explosives. Go! Sanam, don't be so upset. I'm sure whether anybody comes or not.. ..but captain will definitely come for our help. Brother, please help me today. Today it's a question of Sanam's life. I'm going to save my Sanam. Brother, what did you do this? You very well know that.. ..Gaurav is the last hope of our life after Naren. Sister, believe me. I didn't send him. I don't know anything. If anything will happen to Gaurav.. ..henceforth no sister will trust her brother. Major! Don't take Meeta's words seriously. She's not in her sense after losing a son. She's a mother. If Gaurav attains martyrdom in his mission today.. ..then it'll be a matter of prestige for us. This land is always green and beautiful with rivers and.. ..mountains around.
