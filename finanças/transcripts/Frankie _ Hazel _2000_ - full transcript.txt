(mellow music playing) (music continues) (music continues) (Stefan claps) Pay attention, girls. Audition is coming. We need hard work. Very hard work. Victoria, listen to music. And one, two, three, four. Better. Karina, long neck. Make like princess. Francesca, show class. (mellow music playing) -(music stops) -Voila. Very good. (claps) Audition. Girls, audition is soon. Nine weeks. This year is great honor. Natalia Slavyanska herself will be one of judges. Is great honor. Nine weeks. We need hard work. Hard work! Very, very few girls are accepted by City Ballet. You may never have this chance again. You must be ready. Only nine weeks. Practice. Practice. Practice. [Frankie] I've been taking ballet lessons my whole life. Since I was three-years-old. My mother was a prima ballerina. She danced on six continents. My grandmother tells me that men all over the world were madly in love with her. I don't remember her at all. But I miss her. My grandmother and my teacher, Mr. N, say that it is my destiny to be a dancer. They say that I'm very lucky because I've inherited my mother's gift. Hi. Did you know you can actually divorce your family in some states? Are you trying to tell me something? Very funny. You know, I like to keep on top of these things. Knowledge is power. I thought ignorance was bliss. Ignorance is ignorance. Bliss is bliss. They've got nothing to do with each other. So what do you wanna do? What do I wanna do, or what do I have to do? [Hazel] I know. You wanna go to the park but you have to go to the library, right? [Frankie] Hazel's my best friend. We can read each other's minds. Hazel says we have mental telepathy. She's one of the smartest people I know. I knew it. [Frankie] Throw it to second! To second! Oh, you would've had him. (sighs) -He would've had him. -[Hazel] Yeah? Isn't baseball the most beautiful game? If you say so, amiguita. Really, it's like nothing else. That's true. It's the most boring game on the planet. I'd love to play on a team. So why don't you? Look. -(chuckles) Yeah, right. -I mean it. -Get out of here. -Face it, Frankie. You're not happy sitting on the sidelines. I think you should get it out of your system, once and for all. Come over here tomorrow, and try out for the team. You're crazy. I'd never make it. Why not? I've only ever played with your dad and Carlos. So? You can hit. I've seen you. I'm not gonna get on the team. Not with that attitude, you're not. (sighs) Oh, no. I gotta get to the library. (instrumental music playing) And even if I got on the team, when would I play? I've got ballet class five times a week and my audition is coming up. That's exactly my point. There's more to life than ballet, Frankie. You need to expand your horizons. You know, live a little. And how about my grandmother? Can you see her going along with this? She doesn't need to know what you're doing every second of the day. Ignorance is bliss. [Frankie] What happened to "Knowledge is power?" [Hazel] In the right hands. Granny's ignorance... is our bliss. What's this? "Closed Wednesday, Saturday afternoon and Sunday." That's pathetic. It should say, "We never open." But the mayor says right here we have "An open door into the 21st century." Well, you know what? Mayor Harrison will be hearing from me. How in the world am I gonna get that report done by tomorrow? (both chuckle) Carlos. [Frankie] I moved to Percaucus, New Jersey, when I was four. And I've lived next door to Hazel and her brother, Carlos, and their parents ever since. They're like my second family. Antonio! Hola, hijita. Hola, Frankie. -Hola, papi. -Hey! I have a hot tip on some beautiful Yankee tickets. So keep your fingers crossed. Oje. Ven pronto y lavate las manos. Dinner's on the table. -So come over after dinner? -Okay. -Hasta pronto, amiguita. -Cheerio then, love. [Frankie] I live with my grandmother. My parents were killed in a car accident when I was a baby. Granny isn't like anyone else you've ever met. She lives by her very own set of rules and passions. The first rule is that there are two types of taste. Her taste and bad taste. [Mrs. Ferrar] Uh, we were thinking gladiolus. Hmm. -Unless-- -Shall I tell you what I think? I think gladioli are lovely, in the right places. Funerals, hospitals, dentist waiting rooms and so on. (chuckles) That sort of thing. But for a wedding, we must be very careful. We are creating mood of beauty, joy, love, romance. In a word, roses. Oh. Roses. Of course, long-stem red roses. Tiny, delicate, pink tea roses. Tea roses. And maybe a little fern? [Frankie] Hi, Gran. Oh. Francesca darling, you're late. Sorry, Gran, I lost track of time. Mrs. Ferrar, Millicent, my granddaughter, Francesca. -[Mrs. Ferrar] Hello. -How do you do? How do you do, darling? So this is the ballerina? Oh, she is stunning! Remember when you took ballet? I always said you never should've given it up. Mom, I was five-years-old. You were five-year-old, and now you're twenty-five-years-old. and we're talking liposuction. Well, uh, it's been lovely seeing you again. And everything is coming along beautifully. Now, what about tablecloths? Ah, yes, yes. Well, next week, we'll discuss the linens. [Mrs. Ferrar] Good. Goodbye. [Phoebe] Goodbye. And Millicent, you'll make a charming bride. -[Millicent] Thank you. -(door closes) And your mother will be the most terrifying mother-in-law that ever lived. It's tragic how weddings bring out the worst in people. And when you come home late, it brings out the worst in me. I'm sorry. But, darling, you know how I worry. Next time, just pick up the phone. Now, do you have any homework? Lots. And did you know that the library's closed on Wednesdays now? No. This city is coming apart at the seams. [Carlos] I've got a thing on King Tut with some incredible stuff on embalming. Oh, wait, here's what you need. Stream Ecology. This is a good one. It's pretty recent. Oh, gracias, Carlos. These are great. Can I take them home? Uh, sure, let me just log in which issues you're taking. Carlos, you're such an obsessive compulsive. I'm proud of it. (chuckles) [Frankie] You've saved my life. Well, I better go get started. So you're gonna try out tomorrow? -Try out? For what? -[Hazel] Fall Ball. Frankie wants to play but she doesn't think she's good enough. You should go for it. You're good enough. -You think? -Yeah. Here, you can even use my old glove. -Thanks. -[Carlos] Go on and take it and I'll... log it in later. So you're gonna go for it? I might. Muchas gracias, Carlos. Night, Hazel. Night, slugger. -Give me a break. -[Carlos] Night, Frankie. She's gonna do it. I know these things. (mellow music playing) Bedtime, Henry. Right-o. Nighty-night. [Frankie] Granny reads to me every night, just as she read to my mother. She started on Shakespeare when I was five. We've read most of Dickens, except for "A Tale of Two Cities" which she says is rubbish. Now we're doing "The Bronte Sisters." Another one of granny's rules is that you've got to get the 19th century under your belt before you become too cynical about romance. Now, let's see. Where did we leave that rogue Heathcliff? Still staggering about the moors, no doubt. "The rainy night had ushered in a misty morning, "half frost, half drizzle." (indistinct chatter) Okay. Jeff, you're up after... -Ray-jiv? -It's Rajiv. All right. Okay. You then, Jeff. Then, uh, Nick and Frankie. Now, we've only got two positions left, boys. Need a couple of hitters, guys that can really smack that ball. Somebody's not gonna make it. -Don't get your hopes up. -Nice guy. Warm, supportive, caring. Don't pay any attention to him. What do you mean don't pay any attention to him? He's the coach. -Daniel, you're pitching. -Okay, Dad. -Dad? -Mark on first base. Abdul on second, Pete, third. Louie, Carmine, and Tim in the outfield. Uh, the rest of you kids line up here. And, uh... -Rajiv. -Yeah, yeah. Uh, you're up. Pete, get over here. -Hazel. -What? I'm the only girl. Good for you. -I've changed my mind. -You can't change your mind. -Oh, yes, I can. -Listen to me, Frankie. Where would we be today if Susan B. Anthony had changed her mind? Where would we be if Rosa Parks had changed her mind? Where would we be if Amelia Earhart had changed her mind? Hazel, Amelia Earhart disappeared over the ocean without a trace. She should've changed her mind. Picky, picky, picky. -[boy] I got it, I got it. -Not bad. (indistinct chatter) -[man] Yeah, nice smack. -Okay. That's enough. That's good. Uh, Nick. (indistinct chatter) [boy] Great going! Good one. Uh, thanks, Nick. Don't call us. We'll call you. Next! Frankie Humphries! Come on, come on, Frankie Humphries! Let's go. (whistle blows) -Frankie Humphries! -That's me. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on a minute. (sighs) This is an all-boys team. The sign didn't say anything about an all-boys team. Well, sometimes you just have to read between the lines. I don't understand. Are you saying I'm not allowed to try out for this team? Uh, don't take it personally. It's, uh, just a question of, uh, safety. Listen, if you really wanna play baseball, you should try Roselle Park, there's an all-girls league there, that's not half bad! But that's miles away. Sorry. (blows whistle) Say, has everyone else had a shot now? No! Time's a-wasting. Please step away from the plate. I'm afraid she can't do that, coach. -I beg your pardon. -You heard me. And you are... Hazel Perez, counselor-at-law. And you have just violated Title IX, which constitutes gender discrimination. All right. Daniel, pitch a couple to Gloria Steinem over here and let's move this thing along. (indistinct chatter) Hey, Daniel, maybe you should try pitching like a girl. (laughter) Thanks, but no thanks. (clears throat) Show... show her what you got, son. [boy] Whoa! Uh, anyone else out there uh, wanna try? Anyone? No? Well, uh, looks like it's uh, Ray... and Frankie. (chuckles) Listen, Frankie, there'll be no special treatment, no special uniforms and no whining. Practices are Wednesday and Friday, 4:30 p.m. sharp. Uh, first game's in three weeks. Uh, welcome to the team. -You did it! -I can't believe it. -Way to go. -[coach] Uniforms over here! Cool. (instrumental music playing) Hazel, are you really a lawyer? Well, I haven't passed the bar yet, but I'm working on it. -So do you play baseball, too? -No. I'm just here for my client. -Oh, I see. -[coach] Daniel! Get a move on. -Well, maybe I'll see you around. -Sure. (sarcastically) I'll see you around, Hazel. -Stop. -He's cute. Yeah. You were fantastic! [Frankie] Boy, I almost blew it. -[Hazel] Well, I'm proud of you. -[Frankie] Thanks. But there's still one big problem. ♪ Who threw the overalls In Mrs. Murphy's chowder? ♪ ♪ Nobody spoke So I shouted all the louder ♪ (door closes) -Is that you, lovey? -Yes, Granny. Well, come quick. Wash your hands and sit down. -Supper's ready. -Hi, Gran. Hello, my darling. Mwah. -How was your day? -Great. I went to the park with Hazel. -And what did you girls do? -Well... There was a baseball try out. Baseball? I must say I've never understood your interest in that game. It's really a wonderful game, Gran. I think you'd like it. Darling, I'm too old to swing a bat. No, I mean to watch. Uh, it's excruciatingly slow. Slow? In the major leagues, the ball's coming at you at 90 miles per hour. Not at me, thank you very much. God forbid. It's kinda like ballet. You know how everyone thinks it looks so easy? Well, with baseball, it's the same-- Baseball is nothing like the ballet. Just brute force. A lot of men scratching themselves and spitting out great streams of brown fluid. It's revolting. But I'd really like to play and-- You are a dancer, Francesca. And right now, there can only be one focus in your life. And that's your audition. I know, Gran, but I could do both. If you get accepted by this school, in a few short years, you could be dancing with one of the finest companies in the world. I understand that, Gran, but-- You have the talent, darling. I know you have. I watched your mother. A gift like that is very precious. You must not squander it. (mellow piano music playing) -Brava! -(music stops) (sarcastically) Brava. Brava, Francesca. (laughter) Well, I think she's lovely. -Don't you think she's-- -Highly overrated. -In my opinion. -Yeah. I think Mr. N is losing it. He just likes her because her mother is hanging on the wall over there. -I think you're jealous. -Jealous? She's such a little goody-goody. (chuckles) You should see her with her grandmother. "Yes, Granny. Of course, Granny. Can I kiss your feet, Granny?" -She's a pathetic little wimp. -(girl clears throat) I need new ribbons. These ones are short. [Phoebe] Of course she has all that studying to do. I know, they have a test tomorrow. -Yes, a history test. -Right. Oh, now, here she is. Oh, Francesca, where's your jacket? You'll catch pneumonia. -Goodbye, Eliana. -Goodbye, Phoebe. Francesca, I'm afraid I have to go out. -Where are you going? -Floral emergency. I can't see why they can't solve these things without me, but there we are. Now, I've left some sandwiches and biscuits on the table for you. Um, please make sure you have a glass of milk. -Mm-hm. -And don't forget the history test tomorrow. -All right. -So crack those books open. -Gran. -Yes, dear? Nothing. Bye. Buh-bye, darling. I am a pathetic little wimp. [boy] Throw it to me. (indistinct chatter) [Carmine] Hey. Hey, Abdul. Abdul. Get a load of number nine. All dressed up. -(chuckles) -(whistle blows) Okay, listen up, you guys! Partner up and practice catching. Two new kids, uh... What's your name? Frankie and, uh... Radish, you two follow me. -Its's Rajiv. -Yeah. [boy] Hey, give me a grounder. Carmine, throw here! [boy] Come on, man, put some heat on-- Uh, Rajneesh. Grounder. Okay. Frankie. (scoffs) Good! Frankie! Frankie. You're gonna have to do better than this if you wanna play with the boys. Mark! Get over here! Take Frankie into the outfield and throw her a few. -Do I have to? -Yeah, you have to. [boy] Hey, Mark, you got a girlfriend? Nobody wears their uniform to practice, you know. I know now. [Carmine] Hey, Mark, you got a date? You're gonna need a step stool. (sighs) (mellow music playing) (groans softly) Hello, Frankie. How did practice go? Not so good. They don't really want me on the team. What makes you say that? I can just tell. Hey, give 'em some time, Frankie. They'll come around. Oh, and there's one other minor problem. I can't catch. You just need some practice. I mean, hey, everybody needs practice. Here. Go. All right. (groans) See, I told you. Uh, let me see how you're holding that glove. Okay, um... Hold it up more. Like this. All right? All right, let's try it again, okay? All right. Don't be afraid to move, Frankie. Jump for it. And remember to cover the ball with your other hand, so you don't drop it. -Okay. -Okay, let's try it again. There you go. See, you're gettin' it. Try it again. [Carlos] Hey, good shot. (chuckles) Muchas gracias, amigo. Your turn. (giggles) -Not bad. -Not good. You just need some practice. Everyone need to practice. Ha-ha. How do you say "I love plums" in Spanish? Hmm. "I love plums in Spanish." It feels like fall. Don't remind me, my dad will have me raking the leaves soon. I love your father. Yeah, he's a pretty good guy. Do you remember your father at all? No, I was too young. But Granny says I take after him though. You know, he was a pretty big bird lover. Oh, no kiddin'. So I guess you take after both of 'em. You get the birds from your father and ballet from your mother. I wonder where the baseball comes from. Maybe the baseball's just from you. Keep the glove, Frankie. It's yours. Thanks. I wonder how you could possibly recommend that book, Edie. I could barely make it through to the last page. You know what your problem is, Phoebe? You're a snob. Not everything's Shakespeare. This book is charming. It's heartwarming. I wept, and I'm not ashamed to admit it. Well, you ought to be. (whispering) Now-now, Phoebe. [Sasha] I have to be honest. I haven't read a thing since I met Raul. [Frankie] Hello, everybody. -Hi, Gran. -Ah, hello, my darling. Francesca. My love. You look more like your mother every day. -[Sasha] Yeah. -[Edie] Oh, yes. I'll never forget seeing her at Lincoln Center. Francesca. Oh, let me see that face. (exclaims) She's a knockout. Come and sit beside me, Francesca. And bring me up to date. Any boyfriends yet? [Phoebe] Francesca doesn't have time for boys. She's too busy practicing for her audition. You can't control her life forever, Phoebe. Don't you pay any attention to your granny. There is always time for boys. And men are crazy for dancers. (door opens) -[Hazel] Hello? -Come in, Hazel. -Honestly. -Thank God you're here. What's that? It's a petition to keep the library open longer hours. Well, you've come to the right place. Attention. Attention, everybody. Hazel has an important announcement to make. Fellow citizens of Percaucus, it has recently come to my attention that the library hours have been severely shortened. Consequently, I have drawn up this petition, which I plan to present to the mayor. Good for you, Hazel. -Hear, hear. -I like a girl who goes after what she wants. When you run for president, you'll have my vote. What was it last year? Toxic waste? Francesca, come back. One more time. Olga, play that part again. (music starts playing) -Nicht! No! -(music stops) Francesca, where is your mind? At school? With boy? -It's not here. -I'm sorry. Again. (piano music starts playing) [Abdul] Daniel. Hey, Daniel. Hey. -Looking for number nine? -Who? No way. He's looking for the attorney. (chucking) Ah! And here she comes. [Abdul] Hey, hey, hey. (chuckling) (indistinct chatter) -Hi. -Hi. -Come here often? -All the time. -You? -No. I'm just here to see my best friend. She's on the team. -Hmm. -Wow! How do you do that? Oh, it's not so hard. What are you reading? Oh. "Great Women Leaders." It's fascinating. My name is Hazel by the way. I'm Cynthia. Is that your friend? -[Hazel] Yeah, it's Frankie. -[Cynthia] I've heard about her. Frankie! You're 15 minutes late. Now, under normal circumstances, I'd send you home but the truth is, you're the worst player on this team and you can't afford to miss practice. (blows whistle) -Everybody on to the field. -Do you believe that jerk? Do you know him? Sort of. (chuckles) He's my husband. Sorry. I'm sure he's a great guy when you get to know him. Well, his bark is worse than his bite. Right. Listen, do you know what's going on with the libraries in this town? -Mm-mm, no. -I've prepared a petition. To present to the mayor. Good for you. I know my husband's real upset that he's cut the park's budget again. -He has? -Mm-hm. That's an outrage. I have to tell Frankie about this. [Frankie] Help clean up our parks. [Hazel] Help save our libraries. Please. This is important. The decline of civilization is upon us. [Frankie] Please, sir, take a pamphlet. [Hazel] Please, this is important. Please, ma'am. The apathy in this town is really starting to get on my nerves. Look who's here. Now's your chance. Mr. Mayor. Mr. Mayor! Mr. Mayor, what are you planning to do about the library? I beg your pardon. The library. You know, the place with all the books. Yes, yes, I know the library. What's your point? My point is, the library's closed more often than it's open, and the park is a total mess. I wanna know what you're planning to do about it. Young lady, if you have a concern, all you need to do is contact the mayor's office. He reads every letter that goes across his desk. Well, apparently, you haven't read mine, sir. I've sent you six letters already. And I have a petition here with 583 signatures-- I'll be happy to look at your petition, but right now I'm on my way to a council meeting. Why don't you call my office on, uh... Monday. -But-- -Who was that kid? That guy is so out of touch. If I were mayor, I'd want to listen to what I have to say. You'd make a great mayor. You know what? Nobody's even running against him this year. So here's your chance. Hmm. Mayor Perez. I could get used to that. Flour, raisins, rice. Ah. [Carmine] What, you tryna' make fun of my culture? Rajiv! Don't touch that. Ah... I'm just gonna go look at the magazines, Gran. All right. [Carmine] All right. And more chips... A guy's gotta eat, okay. -[Rajiv] This is enough. -[Carmine] All right... Get the chips, man. -[Abdul] Throw it to me. -Go long, go long. [Carmine] It's Joe Montana! [Abdul] Throw it, Carmine. -(gasps) -(dramatic music) (grunts) (applause) -[Abdul] Yeah! -(sighs) [Abdul] Nice catch. That was amazing. Nice catch, baby. -Thanks. -[Abdul] Yeah, way to go. -[Phoebe] Francesca? -Got to go. -See you at the game, no. 9. -[Rajiv] See you in an hour. -[boy] Bye. -[boy 1] Bye. [Phoebe] I'm meeting Millicent and her mother, but I'll be home by 5:00. [Frankie] Oh, okay. Please don't be late again. I won't. Francesca? (sighs) -Yes, Gran? -Have a good class, darling. Thanks. -[Frankie] Oh, good, you made it. -Of course, amiguita Here's your uniform. Here's my bike. Go get changed. [Frankie] So what are-- What are you gonna say? Don't worry, I have something figured out. Have I ever failed you before? I feel so guilty. Don't be silly. You can't miss your first game. Now, get out of here and get changed. (indistinct chatter) Oh, look, it's Francesca's little friend. At least she has a friend. [Stefan] Hazel! Mr. N. Where is Francesca? Oh, I just saw her down the-- Wow, that's gonna be a really bad zit. (gasps) She can't come to class today. -Something terrible happened. -What? Her uncle died, suddenly. I am so sorry. She was close to him? He was her favorite uncle. Uncle... Boris. I too had one Uncle Boris. Of course, she must go to say farewell. Hazel, tell Francesca I will light candle for her. [man] Okay, my friends, this is not about winning or losing. This is about having a good time. And working with your teammates. I'm proud of the progress you've made so far. Now, everybody's gonna get a turn at bat today, so try and relax. What happens here is not gonna change the course of history. Just go out there and do the best you can. -All right? -[boy] All right. Put it in here. [all] Roar, Tigers, roar! (whistle blowing) [coach] All right! Pay attention. Thanks for joining us, Frankie. Now, I'm sick and tired of you people goofing off. This is the real thing. Junior League, six innings, you got it? I want you to use your noggins. No daydreaming, no stupid base running, and please, please, please, remember to hit the cutoff man. Is that clear? -Yes, sir. -(whistle blows) Hit the field. And, Frankie, don't embarrass us. Don't pay any attention to him, Frankie. -We sure don't. -Hey, Frankie, baby. You know, that was some catch back there. Hey, you were flying. Where'd you learn to jump like that? Ballet school. (indistinct chatter) [Hazel] Hey, Frankie! -Hi. -Hi! This is so exciting. What are you reading? "The Power of She." It's great. Thanks for recommending it. -(cheering) -Look. You're really getting it. -[boy] Let's go, Daniel. -[umpire] Play ball. [man] Swing batter, swing batter. [man] Now, run. (indistinct cheering and shouting) [umpire] Out. (cheering) (intense music playing) Whoo! (crowd cheering and applauding) Nice catch, Frankie. Thanks. [boy] Let's go, guys. [boy 2] Okay, let's go. (indistinct chatter) (players yelling) Come on, yes! [umpire] Safe. Come on, Frankie, you can do it. [Cynthia] Come on, Frankie. (indistinct chatter) [boy] Come on, Frankie, send me home. [boy 2] Girl can't hit. [umpire] Strike one. -Strike two. -(crowd groans) [umpire] Strike three, you're out of there. (crowd applauding) Oh, no, this will really shake her confidence. Oh, poor kid. I know just how she feels. Strike three. You're out. You're out! Out! Well, I guess we can kiss this game goodbye. [boy] You can do it! (indistinct cheering) (ball thumps) Way to go, Frankie! (crowd cheering and applauding) Finally! [Hazel] Way to go, Frankie! Whoo! (ball thumps) -Yes! -Whoo! (crowd cheering) -Yeah! -Way to go! That's my boy! (all cheering) Excuse me! Oh, Tigers, who's roaring now, huh? Huh? Come on, come on! Come on! Jeez, what a psycho. (vocalizing) Hey, Hazel, how you doin'? Hi. Nice game. Thanks. Listen, um, I was wondering if you got any more of those petitions. Thought I could maybe help you get some signatures. Sure, thanks. No problem. Thanks a lot. I'll see you around. You were great. Felt so good to hit that ball. By the way, what'd you tell Mr. N.? -Bad news. -What? Your Uncle Boris died. But it was a lovely funeral. You gave a touching eulogy. Hazel, I don't even have an Uncle Boris. Not anymore. What time is it? If I'm late again, Granny's gonna freak. Frankie, it's time to spill the beans to Granny. Lies have a way of catching up with you. Look, if I tell Granny, that's the end of baseball. She thinks the only way I can become a prima ballerina, is if I live and breathe ballet, like my mother did. I'm not ever going to change her mind. (mellow music playing) (music continues) (door opens) (door closes) Hi, Gran. Oh, Francesca, where on earth have you been? I was at the park with Hazel. Well, you're late again. Just ten minutes. Well, late is late. You should've called me. Gran... Anything can happen in ten minutes. How many times do I have to go over it with you? [Frankie] It was just a few minutes. Give me a break. I beg your pardon? What is going on with you? -Nothing. -Nothing? I hardly recognize you anymore. Gran, what do you want from me? A great deal more than I've seen lately. Now, go wash and get ready for supper. I'm not hungry. Don't be ridiculous, supper is ready. I don't want any. (melancholic music playing) (birds chirping) Hey, Frankie. (sniffles) Hey. [Carlos] What are you doing? Thinking. Thinking about what? Oh... Life. Oh. What about it? I don't know... It's just... Everybody's got these high expectations of me. I mean... I love ballet. But it's all I've ever been allowed to do. Well, is that what you wanna do? Be a ballerina? Yeah. I think so. It's just... sometimes, it feels like I'm only doing it because everyone expects me to. It's your life, Frankie. I know. But why does it have to be so complicated? (Antonio speaking Spanish) Look at my crazy father. He always does his best translations in the warm weather when he can work outside. (Speaking in Spanish) [Antonio] Yes, yes, yes! What's he saying? He's translating a poem. (continues in Spanish) No me hagas luchar el amor. What's that mean? It means, um... Don't make me fight love. Oh. (man speaking on radio) Hey, you guys, listen to this. [Churchill on radio] Lead on, oh union, strong and free. What is it? Winston Churchill. It's very inspirational, don't you think? Guess what, I looked through every book I could lay my hands on, and I can't find anything in the city charter that says a kid can't run for mayor of Percaucus. Oh, no, does that mean what I think it means? [Hazel] Yep, I'm throwing my hat in the ring. I'm running for mayor. You're running for mayor? (chuckles) I'm leaving town. I think it's great. I wish I could vote. Remind me to look into lowering the voting age. [Churchill on radio] ...give us the tools and we will finish the job. [Hazel] Fellow citizens, it's time we took notice of what is happening in our community. It's time to take back our city. We can't sit by and watch as it falls apart. The future of Percaucus depends on us. (whimpering) You be the cheering section. I'll be right back. (dog yelping) Hey guys, I need your help. Hazel's running for mayor. How can she run for mayor, she's a kid. She'd make a great mayor. [Frankie] She's giving a speech. I need you guys to come with me. Give me a break, Frankie. I was just about to eat lunch. Carmine, she's got big plans to clean this place up. This is important. I'll tell you what's important. I got a sandwich here cryin' out to me. [Abdul] Now, come to think of it, I hear it too, only, uh... it's calling my name. Hey, hey, come on, you guys. Hazel's our number one fan. -We should help. -And let's face it, Carmine, if Frankie hadn't caught that ball in the sharp right, you'd be in the slammer. You owe her, big time. Did I say I wasn't gonna help? I'm just hungry, all right? A guy could starve around here. All right. Frankie, baby, what do you want us to do? (instrumental music playing) (men chatting indistinctly) Sure you wanna move there? Huh? Listen, my friend's giving a speech in the park. -[woman] Uh-huh. -My friend's running for mayor. She's 13. She's giving a speech right over there. -You wanna come? -[woman] I'll go. [Carmine] Hey, Father Joe. Well, well, well, if it isn't Carmine. Long time, no see. And in the words of Winston Churchill, "Victory at all costs. "Victory however long and hard the road may be." (in a hoarse voice) Uh, hello, is this the news room? I thought you might wanna know there's a breaking story here in the park. [Hazel] I'm running for mayor because I'm frustrated like you. We know firsthand what it means to sit in an overcrowded, under-equipped classroom. Every day, we walk down these littered sidewalks, and we ride our bikes through these pot-holed streets. -[man 1] Right on! -[man 2] We sure do. -And so, fellow citizens... -[man] Press coming through. [Hazel] ...in the words of a great leader, ask not what Percaucus can do for you, ask what you can do for Percaucus. -[woman] Hear, hear! -(crowd cheering and applauding) We are here at Percaucus Park where a rally is being held by a new candidate for mayor, thirteen-year-old, Hazel Perez. Miss Perez, tell us, what makes you think that you are possibly qualified to run a city? I'm glad you asked that question, Jean. Look, I've lived in Percaucus all my life, I know what it means that there's no budget for park programs and that the libraries are closed half the time. I challenge the mayor to come out here and discuss these issues in an open debate. Thank you all for coming. And remember, a vote for Perez is a vote for Percaucus. (crowd cheering and applauding) Viva Percaucus! -[all] Viva! -Viva Percaucus! [all] Viva! Viva Hazel! [all] Viva! I'm telling you, Tom. You can't keep ignoring this kid. You're starting to go down in the polls. What are you talking about? I'm running unopposed. [man] Not anymore, you're not. This Perez kid's filed papers. She's on the ballot. That's ridiculous. Oh, maybe so. But every day, she's out there wowing the voters, and you're... unavailable for comment. People are saying she's right, you are out of touch. People are saying, you're afraid of a little girl. You're telling me I should stand up in public and debate a child? That's precisely what I'm telling you to do. (laughs) (sighs) Sir... Excuse me. Hi. (indistinct chatter) [Antonio] Phoebe, over here. I'm glad you made it. Hola, Frankie. This is exciting. Good luck, Hazel. -Thank you. -Antonio. -Phoebe... -I got here as soon as I could. I had to retake the stupid history test. Frankie, you've got to help me. I can't do this. I'm only a kid. I must've been crazy. You just have stage fright. Everybody gets it before they do something important. Yeah? What do they do about it? Well, before I go on stage to dance, I close my eyes and I hear my music in my head. The music reminds me that I love to dance. I don't hear anything. -I'm leaving. -You can't leave. You really care about this town. You have great ideas. That's your music, amiguita. Listen to it. Miss Perez, we are ready for you. (buzzer buzzes) You'll be great. -I am very nervous. -(chuckles) Good afternoon and welcome, as WNKW of Percaucus brings you the first debate of this mayoral campaign. His Honor, Thomas Harrison, has been mayor of Percaucus for over two decades. For many citizens, he is Percaucus. Thirteen-year-old challenger, Hazel Perez, is an honor student at Alexander Hamilton Junior High School, and a lifelong citizen of Percaucus. [Mayor] ...for this city. And in my 22 years in office, I've worked tirelessly to create jobs for Percaucus, and to encourage the growth of industry in our fair city. I believe my record stands for itself. Experience like mine is just not something you can learn in junior high school. [Hazel] That's true, Mr. Mayor. But while you were in your office all those years making policy and encouraging industry, my classmates and I were experiencing overcrowded classrooms, overworked teachers, and outdated textbooks. [Hazel on TV] I may be just a kid, but when I walk down our littered streets, -play in our filthy park... -[Daniel] All right, Hazel. ...or find the library closed more than it's open, I have to ask, why? Miss Perez, you know nothing about how government works. [Hazel] Maybe not. But I was raised to believe that government was supposed to work for the people. My father always says, "Hechos son amores y no buenas razones." That means, that you judge a person by his good deeds. You have been in charge of the highest office in Percaucus for 22 years, Mr. Mayor. How will the future judge you? What good deeds will you leave behind for the children of Percaucus. (cheering) -Ah! -(giggles) Miss Perez... (paper rustling) Miss Perez, I came to this debate with the sole purpose of nipping your campaign in the bud. The idea of a 13-year-old candidate seemed so preposterous to me. But now... Miss Perez, you remind me of a young man who became mayor of this town many years ago, because he had... new ideas and a passion for change. Miss Perez, you've given me an idea. Would you accept a brand-new position in my administration? The position of Youth Advisor to the Office of the Mayor. (all gasp) [Mayor] Please say yes. Percaucus needs you. Thank you, Your Honor. It's a very tempting offer. I'll think about it. (applauding) [all] Viva Hazel! (alarm ringing) Francesca, this is not up to your usual standards. (bell rings) Francesca, come back, I want to talk to you. (piano playing) (clock ticking) Francesca, come back. Where you are going? Hey, hey, hey. Toro, toro. Toro. [Daniel] Go Frankie. [man] Out! Hi, Gran. Is supper ready? Smells great. Sit down, Francesca. (clears throat) I had an unfortunate phone call today. You did? [Phoebe] Yes, I did. Apparently, you're about to fail history. Oh, I can explain. There's nothing to explain. You and Hazel are out riding your bikes in the park, every afternoon, and you're neglecting your studies. You've had abysmal test scores and... today, I understand, you fell asleep in the class. I promise it won't happen again. It certainly won't. You are grounded until further notice. (Henry chirping) (Henry chirping) Now I know how you feel, Henry. Cooped up all day. Well, at least you don't have to do homework. (doorbell ringing) [Phoebe] Millicent, what a surprise! Come in I was just in the neighborhood. I hope I'm not interrupting anything. No, not at all. I was just about to have a glass of sherry. Why don't you join me? (knocking on window) What are you doing here? You know I am grounded. Amiguita... the boys and I thought you needed some cheering up. Come on, guys, the coast is clear. Only two weeks to go before your wedding. It's a very exciting time for you. (sobbing) Um... Perhaps, a little stressful. There are just so many decisions to make. And, Mom and I don't agree on anything. Listen, now, not to worry. That's my job. Your job is to have the time of your life. (sobbing, sniffing) You leave your mother to me. -Hey, Frankie. -Hey, Rajiv. Carmine, I can't believe it, hey! -Hey, nice place. Nice wallpaper. -[Frankie] Thanks. -[Henry] Good morning. -Nice bird. Hey, what are you guys doing here? (softly) Guys, guys, quiet. My grandmother is gonna kill me. (sighs) -[Rajiv] Hey, Dan, Dan. -Shh... What's the matter, baby, aren't you glad to see us? Yeah, we've missed you. Yeah, specially Rajiv, you know. He wants to marry you. -[Rajiv] Shut up, Carmine. -[Hazel] Rajiv... [Frankie] Shh. Stop it. So are you gonna get out on good behavior. Not before my audition. When's that? Two weeks. Can't believe you actually wear these things. Everyday. So you stand on your toes... and dance. Sounds like torture to me, baby. Oh, no! When the music carries you, it feels like you're flying. -Let's see. -Yeah. Let's see. Show us how you do that jump. -Really? -Yeah, come on, Frankie. [Henry] Uh-oh. She even says my dress looks cheap. Don't pay any attention to your mother, dear. (loud thud) Would you excuse me a moment? (thudding continues) (indistinct chatter) [Frankie] Oh, careful. -Shh. -[Carmine] Tinkerbell. (clattering) (thudding) Francesca? Quick, she's coming. (all clamoring) -[Phoebe] Is everything all right? -Yes, Gran. Come on, get going. May I come in? I heard a noise. What happened? Um, I was just practicing. And I knocked over some books. Oh. Oh, that's all right. Good. Carry on, darling. And I'm sorry for interrupting. (sighs) Bye, Gran. [Carmine] Come on, get out and go. Whoa! Aw, nuts! Whoa! It was my granddaughter. Practicing for her audition. It's very important for her. Now... what was I saying? Your mother. You know, I've seen this happen a thousand times. The older generation seems to lose touch with the younger generation. It's as if they can't remember what it's like to be young. -(cloth rips) -(thuds) [Carmine] Pirouette. (whistling) -(groans) -(objects clatter) (alarm ringing) Good morning. (piano music playing) Hi, Phoebe. I took the liberty of bringing you the newspaper this morning. What? Hazel, you're the bee's knees. How does it feel to be taking over at City Hall? -Feels great. -(laughs) -[Frankie] Hi, Gran. -Look who is in the paper. Oh, my God, you're famous. Now, don't forget all the little people who helped you on your way up. Of course, not. And your name is? Very funny. Oh, I know you. Aren't you the little girl with the big audition today? Don't remind me. I'm a nervous wreck. But of course, you are, darling. It's par for the course. (telephone ringing) You'll be fine when you get there. Hello. I'm sorry, who? You... Oh. Mrs. Ferrar. (knocking on door) Hey, Frankie, is the coast clear? Hey, Hazel. -(overlapping chatter) -Shh. Uh, what, no, I'm afraid that's impossible. I did explain to you, if you remember, my granddaughter has a very important audition today. Yes, that's why I sent Jean-Pierre. What are you guys doing here? Isn't the game about to start? Yeah, but we can't play without you. Thanks, guys, but today's my audition, remember? Jean-Pierre? What on Earth is going on? What? Really? Oh, gracious. You don't understand, Frankie. You've gotta play. Show her. We're beggin' ya, baby. I can't. My audition's at one o'clock. The game will be over by noon at the latest. -You'll make it. -Sure, you will, Frankie. Well, did you try some champagne? Oh. Right. Well, pour some into Mrs. Ferrar and I'll be there in half an hour. Frankie, please. -Please. -Frankie, come on. (coughs) Francesca, there's a crisis. Now, there's a chance I will be able to be back in time to take you to the audition. I'll have to meet you there. Do you think you can manage? Uh, I guess so. Well, take Hazel with you for moral support. Now, listen, my love. I know you're going to be simply wonderful. I have complete faith in you. Don't have so much faith in me, Gran. I might disappoint you. Impossible. (chuckles) I only wish your mother were here to see you. Bye, Gran. Goodbye, darling. (door opens) -(whispers) Come on. -(door closes) [all] Please. (instrumental music playing) (groans) Oh! Sorry. [Phoebe] I'll be right back, young man. (indistinct chatter) (sighs) Thank God you're here. She says she won't talk to anyone but you. Where is she? (instrumental music) Millicent dear, it's Phoebe Harkness. [woman] Oh, there she is. (camera shutters clicking) [woman 1] This is exciting. (speaking in Spanish) -(indistinct chatter) -How nice to see you. (indistinct chatter) Strike two! (indistinct chatter) [boy] Come on, Daniel. [boy 1] Keep your eye on the ball. (indistinct chatter) Strike three! You're out! (indistinct chatter) Hustle, hustle. Good job, Daniel. The rest of you guys, get serious. Stefan Petrovich, we understand you have a star for us this year. Ah, yes, Francesca Humphries. Francesca Humphries? Any relation to Anna Humphries? -Her daughter. -Hm. Does the girl measure up to her mother? Wait and see. (indistinct chatter) [umpire] You're out! That's three. -Where are you going? -It's over, isn't it? How can it be over? Nobody scored. I don't get it. What happens now? We go into extra innings. How long does that take? You better take out your knitting. This could go on all day. ...so you walk down the aisle, looking more beautiful than ever, and your lovely Carl will be waiting for you. You look into each other's eyes, then you'll join hands to become husband and wife, forever together, till death do you part. But... Yeah, but what, dear? (sobbing) But he's so... so... boring! (indistinct chatter) Hazel, this is bad, really, really bad. I think I have to leave. No. I've got an idea. (sobbing) Granny's gonna kill me. Don't worry, amiguita. Good news, everyone. Millicent has come to her senses. Oh, thank God. The wedding is off. (gasps) (piano music playing) (gasps) (scattered applause) I can't believe. That floor is terrible. Oh, God. Please, God. I'll never tell another lie as long as I live. Just get me out of this mess. Frankie, relax. You're making me nervous. Sit down. Carmine, you don't understand. Nine years of ballet for nothing. (umpire speaks indistinctly) Oh, man. Hello! Anybody home? What are you bozos trying to pull? Are you deliberately trying to lose? Because if I didn't know any better, I'd say you were trying to throw this game. (whispers) Psst. Hey, Carmine, come here a second. [Carmine] What? (whispering) I've got an idea. I think I know... [umpire] Strike one! Two! Three! You're out! (grunts) Don't let us down. [umpire] One! Two! Three! You're out. -(groaning) -Yes! -All right! -(grunts) Way to go, way to go. What's going on? Hey, Frankie, it's like I always say, it's not whether you win or lose, it's how you throw the game. [umpire] Strike! Strike three! You're out! (grunts) (cheering) I can't believe you guys would do that for me. Forget about it. Let's go. (piano music playing) (applause) (dramatic music playing) (cycle bells ringing) Next, Francesca Humphries. Francesca Humphries. Last call, Francesca Humphries. (indistinct chatter) Ladies and gentlemen... (clears throat) ...on behalf of His Honor, Thomas P. Harrison, Mayor of Percaucus, I'd like to extend a formal welcome to the legendary Natalia Slavyanska. Thank you. Your life and career are an inspiration to each and every one of us. Thank you so much. Young lady, that's all very nice, but we are in the middle of an audition here. Sergei, please, don't interrupt. Let her talk. Continue, child. Miss Slavyanska... ever since I was born, in a humble but respectable home right here in Percaucus... (intense music playing) Uh... Hi, Gran. Francesca? And as the Mayor's special representative, I'd like to offer you the key to the city. (kids laughing) Of course, this isn't the actual key. This is really the key to my locker at school. It's just to give you the idea. (door opens) But I don't want to waste any more of your valuable time. Without any further ado, may I present my friend, Francesca Humphries. Good luck. (piano music playing) (music continues) (music continues) (music continues) (crowd applauding) Yes! (indistinct chatter) Great job. Good job. -Frankie. -Hey. -That was great. -Thanks. Where's Gran? Oh, I think she left. Oh. Okay. Gran? I'm sorry. I can explain. Can you? How long has this been going on? A couple of months. I see. I wanted to play baseball and I thought you'd say no. So I figured if I could do it and still do my ballet, it wouldn't matter. I'm really sorry. I'm sorry too. (melancholic music playing) (sobbing) Gran... will you come to the game? It's my last one. I think that's too much to ask. I didn't mean to upset you. I just wanted to play baseball. This is not about baseball, Francesca. You know that. It's about how you've lied to me and deceived me all this time. I don't know how you can do that. But I had no choice. Well, of course, you had a choice. You could've told me. But, Gran, if I told you, you just have tried to stop me. Yes. Yes, I would. To safeguard your future. My future? Francesca, I know plenty of people who when they're older blame their parents for not pushing them when they were young. And they say, "I could've done this, "I might have been that, "if only you'd made me work at it." I didn't want that for you. I know that, Gran. I realize that the ballet demands dedication, and a certain amount of sacrifice, but your mother did it. And surely, it's worth it if it makes your dreams come true. Whose dreams, Gran? What? Shouldn't I be allowed to choose my own dreams? Because it's my life. Not yours, not my mother's. Mine. (door opens) [Edie] Phoebe, we're here! -Hello, darling. -Francesca. Why, Francesca, what a delightful costume. It's not a costume, it's my baseball uniform. I've got a game today. I didn't know she played baseball. I dated a baseball player once. He had quite an arm, let me tell you. -Phoebe. -[Sasha] Phoebe, darling. Why don't we all go and watch, cheer Francesca on? Fabulous. Phoebe, let's go. I thought we were supposed to be having lunch together. I have a souffle in the oven. Come on, Phoebe. We've never seen her play. It'll be fun. You go if you want to. I don't feel like going out today. Well, save some for us, darling. I'm sure it won't take long. (chuckles) (scoffs) [crowd] Go Pups! Go Pups! Go Pups! Go Pups! Yay, Pups! Everything all right, Frankie? -I'll be okay. -Okay. [man] Let's go, boys. Come on. Listen up, you guys. This is the big one. The one that separates the men from the boys. No offense, Frankie. You have to win this one. Don't make me look like a jackass. I don't think he needs any help in that department, do you? [coach] Now, that last game was a horror show. Nine innings, you still managed to blow it. I don't wanna see that same feeble performance today. Daniel, try to pitch the ball over the plate for a change, huh? And the rest of you clowns, think before you throw. I don't know how many times I'd have to tell you that to get it through your thick skulls! Now, get out there and show those Tigers you're not a bunch of marshmallows! -Thanks, coach. -We got it. I don't know about you guys, but, uh, makes me feel like a million bucks. Oh, yeah, I'm all pumped up now. Come on, Shane. Come on. [umpire] Play ball. (indistinct chatter) [man 1] Let's go, Daniel. [man 2] Hey, batter, batter, batter. [umpire] Strike one! (crowd cheering) Oh, man. No. (crowd cheering) Yoo-hoo, Francesca! -Darling! Darling! -Francesca! Francesca! (indistinct chatter) -Mr. Mayor, hi. -Hey, nice to see ya. Hey, move. -Great day, isn't it? -Meet Cynthia. Oh, hi. Phoebe. Hola. I can't control the aphids. (chuckles) I can see that. Aren't you going to the game? I'm not particularly interested in baseball. Well, but... but it's Francesca. Antonio, I don't think you fully understand the situation. Uh, perhaps not, but we both know she meant no harm. You have done a fantastic job raising Francesca. She's a wonderful girl. And you know she loves you very much. But now, and if you forgive me, Phoebe, you must let her find her own way. I'm sorry, Antonio, but I think I know what's important for my daughter. Uh, I mean my granddaughter. You know my favorite aphorism? "The greatest gift you can give your child "is roots and wings." And you have given her very strong roots, Phoebe. Come with me to the game. Forgive her, Phoebe. (indistinct chatter) Come on, Rajiv! -You can do it! -Smack it, baby! [boy] Keep your head on it. Hit that ball! -Strike! -[boy 1] You can do it, come on. (cheering) It's about time. -[boy 2] Come on, Frankie. -[boy 3] It's all you, Frankie. Hey. Papi, where's Phoebe? I'm sorry, amiguita. I did the best I could, huh? (dramatic music playing) [umpire] Strike one! O and one. [umpire] Strike two! O and two. -(indistinct chatter) -One more, one more. Strike three! You're out of there. -(grunts) -Oh, Frankie. [boy 3] You got it, Wendell! (crowd cheering) [umpire] Out at first. That's two. (crowd cheering) You're out! Strike one. (crowd cheering) All right, Rajiv, come on, hit it out of the park. (crowd cheering) (indistinct chatter) -Time out, ump. -[umpire] Time! -Frankie, come here. -Time out! Listen, uh, there's still a chance that we can win this one. Um... Let's face it. You've never been that reliable. Daniel, you're up! Frankie, sit down. Wait a second, Frankie. -Dad. -You heard me, son. That's not fair. It's Frankie's turn. Oh, you're breaking my heart. Now, move it. This isn't right, Dad. Did I ask for your opinion? Now, do as you're told. -No. -Excuse me? I said no. Is this some kind of a joke, Daniel? No, Dad. What the hell's wrong with you? Don't you wanna win? Not this way. You know, son, that's the way a loser talks. Harold. Cynthia, honey, sit down. You don't know anything about baseball. Harold, you sit down. And shut up. [umpire] Let's go, coach. Get a batter in the box. (instrumental music playing) Go ahead then, Frankie. It's all up to you. Screw it up and we lose the pennant. Good luck, Frankie. -Come on. -[Carmine] Go, Frankie! Wait for your pitch, Frankie. [boy] You can do this, Frankie. -Strike one! -[Carmine] It's all right, Frankie. Don't think about it. [Abdul] Come on, Frankie, you can do it. -[umpire] On one. -Come on, let's go. [Hazel] Come on, Frankie! Come on, Frankie! -Come on, Frankie! -Hit it, Frankie! Hit it! -Frankie, hit it! -Touchdown, touchdown. [umpire] Strike two! Okay, Frankie, come on, hit me home, come on. There goes the whole season down the toilet. (cheerful music playing) [boy] Come on, Frankie, let's do it. [man] Let's go in, field! Good pitch now, Mike, good pitch. [Carmine] Frankie, come on. Come on. (all cheering) Well done, Frankie! Well done! (all cheering) (cheering continues) We did it, we did it. [Hazel] Way to go. Coach. (laughs) Frankie? Frankie? Brava, Francesca. Brava. Frankie... (all chanting) Pups, go! Pups, go! Pups, go! Pups, go! Pups, go! Pups, go! Pups, go! Pups, go! Pups, go! (triumphant music playing) [Frankie] It's funny how a path you thought was taking you somewhere else can lead you home again. When the letter came accepting me into City Ballet, Gran was thrilled. But best of all, I realized that it was my dream all along. The Pups love their new assistant coach, Cynthia. Hazel found her inner music and has practically taken over city hall. Oh, and Gran and I finally finished "Wuthering Heights," and now we're on to "Jane Eyre." She still reads to me every night. I'm glad some things never change. (piano music playing) (music continues) (music continues) (music continues) (music continues) (music stops)
