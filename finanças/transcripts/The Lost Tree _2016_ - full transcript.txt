- Hey. - Hey, I got your text. - Yeah, let's celebrate tonight. - You got the promotion? - I sure did. - That's awesome. So we can finally get the living room painted, and that bedroom set. Why don't you start by picking out a perfect little restaurant for us tonight? Okay, um, what are you in the mood for? Hey, what the hell?! Oh. Sorry. What? Uh, nothing. Look, I'm just getting back to the office right now, so, uh, I better go. Okay, okay. Well, love you. I love you too. I'll see you tonight. I know. You're impressed. It's all right, you can admit it. So how did you close the account? Uh, well, I told them that if they went with Schultz, they'd be signing their death certificates. Wow. Well, all right. So, did you tell the missus yet? Yeah, I, uh, I texted her right away. You know, we're gonna go celebrate tonight. But, um, we'll see how she feels after we've spent four straight weeks together on vacation. It's too bad, 'cause I would have really enjoyed having our own private celebration. Sounds like I'm missing out. Yeah, we both are. Just a few years too late. Well... what she doesn't know won't hurt her, right? What? I was told I could find you here. Emma. It's not what you think, I... Emma? Oh, God. Emma?! - I didn't see her. - It's my wife. I didn't... I... - Hey, you should... - Call an ambulance! Emma? Emma? Please wake up. No, Emma, no... No, please don't do this. Please! I'm so sorry. Please wake up. I love you. I love you. Just you and me. We'll be gone from here. Just you and me. I love you. Hey, you've reached Emma... And Noah. Leave a message. Hey, it's me again. Just seeing how you are. Well, if you need anyone to talk to, I'm... I'm here. Okay, bye. Finally decided to pay you a visit. What are you doing here? I know where you been. Oh, you do? Of course I do. Told you not to keep going there. Gotta make up your own mind. All right, we've had this conversation before. I don't want to hear it from you again. Maybe not, but I know exactly how you feel. Yeah, everyone thinks that they know how I feel. You know, listen. Your mother, when she died, I mean... It was over for me. I had nothing left. There was one thing that kept me going. I wanted to see how my son turned out. My life wasn't supposed to turn out this way. There's only one person that can turn your life around. That's you. That's your job. My job's over. You gotta do this for yourself. Hey, just promise me that you'll never go back there again. Take some time. Get away from it all. Hey. I don't know if you can hear me or not, but not a day goes by without you. But I miss you. I'm going away for a little bit. Hey. Hey, you're back. You know, I've been trying to reach you. Are you... are you back for good, or...? I'm leaving. Oh, but what about the McQuarry account? I'll... work on it remotely and upload the files via FTP. Oh. Sorry. Hello? Hey, Dad. It's me. Oh, hey, uh... What's going on? I just wanted to let you know that I rented a cabin in Lost Lakes. I'm getting out of the city. Well, congratulations. Well, figured you were right. Little time away. Could do me some good. Anyway, I'll, uh... take some photos when I get up there and send 'em to you. Sounds great. I'm proud of you. All right. Talk to you in a bit. Noah? That's me. Hi! Alan Parks, we spoke earlier. How are you? Hey, Alan, it's nice to meet you. You, too. Uh... So where is the property? Oh, it's right up the road. I parked out front to help you find the place easier. It's an easy... easy place for people to miss, but I guess that's why you're coming out here. Great, so... should we go see the place? Well, uh, you know... Actually, I'm supposed to show another place here in a bit. So why don't I just hand you the keys, and if you have any questions you can just reach me on my cell. Here. Um, so what you want to do is you want to continue up that road there to the left, it's the yellow house up on the hill. Okay. Um... thanks. Uh, by the way, the family that lived there before left all their stuff there. Why's that? I'm not sure really. They just up and left. Well, which reminds me, if you like swimming and fishing, there's a pond nearby. So just follow the trail behind the house, you'll lead right to it. Okay. Aw, that's disgusting. Noah. So, Moppy, where we going on vacation this year? You know how much I hate that nickname, right? I think it's so cute. So where do you want to go? I don't know. How 'bout, uh... How 'bout Vegas? How about... I was thinking somewhere more quiet, you know? Get out of the city for a little bit. Hey, we can rent a cabin. I mean, why go from one crowded city to another? Probably because, uh, I would die of boredom if we were in a cabin. Well, I personally think that I have more than enough ways to keep you occupied. Oh, you do? It's just the two of us. - Do you? - All alone. - Mm-hmm. - In a cabin. And away from everything. Oh, shit. Hello? Noah, it's me. Oh, hey, Dad. How's it going? It's good. Thanks, it's, uh... very peaceful. Everything you expected? So far, so good. You know, I'm still just adjusting to... You there? You know, let me... let me call you back in a little bit. I just gotta... I'm gonna check on something. Sure, call me later. Why don't you send me some pictures. Take a couple of snapshots and send 'em to me. Love to see what the place looks like. Yeah, sure. This isn't funny anymore. Now what? What the hell is... What the f... Where are you? I did talk to my mom last night. Oh, yeah? Is she still pissed that you moved in with me? Pretty much, but I... I don't care. Well, what did you say to her? Well, I mean, I told her that she needed to basically let me live my life the way I wanted to, and, you know, she should focus on hers more. You said that? - Yeah. - Mm? Yeah, I did. And then she hung up on me directly after. That sounds about right. Mm-hmm, yeah. I'll have to treat you right, then. Well, I hope so. I mean, I'm only isolating myself from my family over you. Well, in that case... I'll have to make an honest woman out of you then. Is that what I think it is? Yes. It is. I don't know what to say. Well, say yes. Are you gonna love me forever? Of course I will. Even when I'm like, old and gray-haired and wrinkly? Yes, even when you're old and gray-haired. Oh, yes! Of cour... Yes, yes. Yes. Yes, of course, yes. Oh, my God, I'm the happiest girl in the world. Oh, I love it. Come here. Hold on, hold on, I love it. I love it, I love it. Thank you so much, I love you. I love you too. I'm getting really sick of this. You've gotta be kidding me. Ugh! That is just weird. Come on. Well... Guess I won't be getting any sleep tonight. What the hell? No. Damn it! Guess I'll be paying you a visit tomorrow. Well, looks like I won't be swimming or fishing, Alan. What, you got something to say? This can't be happening. Are you kidding me? - Wha... - Jenna. Uh... I... I'm so sorry. Did I catch you at a bad time? No. No. Um... Look, please, just come in. Are you sure? Yeah. Yeah. I... It's a long story. Well, uh... Wow. This is... interesting. Yeah, it's... Don't look at me. I didn't know this place was decorated like this, you know, until I got here. I see. So, what... what brings you all the way out here? Well, I just wanted to see how you were doing and also see if you had that file that you were supposed to send me today. Right. The file. You see, it got... No, no. It got corrupted, so... I mean, I basically have to start from scratch. I just need a few days more. You know what? It's okay. Really, don't stress about it, actually. I was gonna tell you that, um... Bob gave the account to Mitch. Just in case, you know, you were... What, in case I... in case I flaked? I mean, I'm gonna do the work. No, Noah. I mean, we all know that you're going through a really difficult time, and... - You know what? It's just fine. - ...you just... Really, if Bob thinks that Mitch is qualified, that's just fine. Uh... I'm... I'm sorry. Uh... Obviously, you know, I'm here. I do need some time. Hey, I didn't mean to talk to you like that. It's not your fault. It's okay. It's just that we haven't even really talked about what happened, and... Jenna... I just need a little bit more time, you know, by myself, before I... Sure. I just really... I really miss our friendship. I miss you. Yeah. Me too. I can't. I'm sorry. Do you have a restroom or something that I could... Um, the bathroom? Yeah, it's, um... It's right through there, to the left. Jenna... Did you... Did you say something? Noah, I thought you said... Sorry. What did you say? I'm sorry. Jenna. Hey, wait. Jenna. Wait a second. Just tell me what's wrong. No, I gotta get outta here. Noah, please leave with me right now. What? I just got here yesterday. I'm telling you, there is something wrong with this cabin. Okay, calm down, all right? Just tell me what happened. There was someone with me in the bathroom. You already know. What do you mean? Please get out of here. Please. Please, just... just get out of here. I'm sorry. What the hell? Great. Now I just gotta find the breakers. Where is it? That damn tree. What are you hiding? Who is this? Moppy? Emma? That really you? Why? Why did you do this to us? Emma... This can't be you. You promised you'd love me forever. How do you... No. Damn you! You're not Emma. What... Yeah. Let's see if anything tries to stop me from getting my ring back. What the hell is with this place? Hey, Noah, hi. It's me, your dad. Just calling to check up on you. I got those pictures that you sent, and, uh, they're really kind of... Look, I can't talk right now. I... I wish I had a dime for every time I've heard you say that. When is ever a good time to talk to you? It's Emma. She's here. Oh, my God. Well... Emma is dead, son. I know that. I... But she's here. I can't explain it. She can't be there with you, son. Please. You know, you really need to come home. That's what you need to do. She's not there. No, you're not listening to me. Okay? I can't leave. Not yet. She's gonna be here tomorrow. - Emma is dead. She's gone, son. - No... You see this? Do you see this? She sent this to me yesterday. All right? I talked to her on the phone. Noah, please. It's time to come home. You need to listen to me. I'm sorry. I just... I can't leave. Not yet. I'll talk to you later. Shit! Shit! Hey, Dad, it's me. - Tell me that you're outta there. - Yeah. I am. - I got your pictures. - What did you see? Oh, I think you have to see that for yourself. - Okay. - This can't wait till tomorrow. Well, I'm headed back to my apartment right now. - I should be there in about an hour. - I'll meet you there. Okay. See you soon. - All right. - Bye. - Dad. - Hey. Hey. Hey. I was worried about you. Yeah. But I'm okay. I'm here. Good. So what was it that you... you saw? - Remember those pictures you sent me? - Yeah. All right. I've been looking at 'em. I noticed something very, very strange. Yeah. Dad... - You see what I mean? - Dad. I know about the shadows, okay? That's not the only thing. Here. Take a closer look. Right here. Right here. From any angle, there's, like, a shadow across your throat. Why? What do you think they are? I don't know what they are, but whatever it is, it seems like some kind of threat. Remember, I told you that Emma was there. Emma is nowhere near that house. Well... there's this, um... There's this tree that's behind the cabin. I don't know. It's like something was preventing me from ever getting near it. Why would you ever go back to that house ever again, for any reason? Noah? Noah, it's me, Jenna. Noah? Noah? Alan, you son of a bitch. Noah? Where are you? Alan, I got your text. Alan, I know you're in there. What the... I can see you in there! Jenna! What... No. No, no, no. I did what you asked. No. No. I-I-I didn't tell him anything! I didn't know... No. No, no... Come on, Jenna. Jenna! No. No. No. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. You bastards. Fuck you! Come on! Where is it, you bitch? I know you have it! I know you have it. I know you have it. You're Claudia.
