Dying doesn't scare me. - Living, now that's the frightening part. -[Chattering] [Screaming] Get off me, man. Hands. Stop lookin' at me. "When I plunged the knife in her, it made me have an orgasm." Those are your words. Were you present at the Tate killings? I'll be fine. Thank you. But a chair would be nice. - Chair, please. - Yeah. Sure. Got a guitar for me in there in that case? No, it wouldn't fit, and I didn't want to disappoint you -with a ukulele. - Well, I could've made do. - I need somethin' to inspire me in here. - Thank you. What kind of guitar? Martin? Whatever I can get a tune out of. - Can't get much out of these. -[Tinkles bars] They all sound the same. How's that jury selection going? Not good. The death of public figures usually carries some sort of bias. You know, lots of people come in here scared shitless. I come in here it's like a goddamn high school reunion. [Laughs] Might as well be. You haven't told me much about where you grew up, Charlie. Now, why should I tell you anything about that? I was in jail. The end. This is gonna be a long one. It might help. Well, I got time. What I don't have is a guitar. Well, long time back there was a teenager named Kathleen Maddox. Kathleen Maddox went to a hospital in Cincinnati and gave birth. Gave birth to a little boy named Charlie manson. Although, at that time, he wasn't called "Charlie manson." He was named "no-name Maddox." And the shit just spread out from there. [Manson] Never really knew who my real daddy was. Got my name from a guy named "Willie manson," but that didn't last. The fact of the matter is, I was born illegitimately and it automatically put me on the wrong side of the law. [No audible dialogue] Not a bad gig for a man born with no father and barely a mother. A man his mother sold for a pitcher of beer and a black eye. But don't get me wrong, I don't hate her. That's not how I operate. You gotta have a relationship with someone to hate 'em. No, man. I was just a kid trying to find my way. [Swing music playing] Charlie... Charlie, is that you? Char...! Charlie, what the hell are you doing? You know you're supposed to be in bed. [Manson] The sound of a switch was my lullaby and the pain that followed was my glass of milk. That's what taught me self-reliance. You mad at your mama? She can't help who she is. People are who they are and they do what they're gonna do. Niggers do what they do. Jews do what they do. You can't change people, Charlie. You can't change who they are. You were born a rebel, Charlie. And don't you ever forget it. Here. You promise me you're gonna keep that with you wherever you go. I love you, Charlie. [School bell ringing] [Chattering] [Manson] Some folks like to think they can find some reason behind the actions of people they look down on or consider low-life, but the truth is that we're all what we are and we do what we're gonna do. [Rock 'n roll music playing] Time kept keepin' on. Life did the same. Soon life brought me the prettiest girl I'd ever seen up until that point in my life. [Camera shutter clicking] See, bein' a family man now I had to support the family somehow. So, I did the only thing I knew how to do, and I kept doin' it and kept doin' it and kept on doin' it. - That's when they had to come and get me. -[Buzzing ] I was in jail when Charlie, Jr. was born. - Looks like he has your eyes. -[Baby cooing] That's funny. I was thinking the same about you. Maybe he's got one of yours and one of mine. When did you get so good at sharing? I'm a daddy now. I gotta learn him right... Set an example. This may not be the best place to do that. Well, yeah, but... By the time I get outta here he'll be old enough to remember me but not old enough to remember this place. -[Baby crying] - I shouldn't bring him here. You don't want me to see my boy? I'm gonna go now. No, no. No-no. Rosie, don't do that. Don't leave, okay? Let's just play a little game. Let's have some fun... Me, you and little Charlie, okay? No, I have to run some errands -and I have to go into work. - Rosie, don't be rude! Don't go! You're not setting a good example for our little boy. I can't bring him back here. How am I supposed to see him? I don't know. You can't. [Buzzing] I haven't got any visits or letters from Rosie in months, ma. I just wanna see my little boy. There's no harm in that. Rosie's not livin' with me anymore. Well, where is she then? She moved out. She moved in with someone else. Someone else? Like another family or, like, a friend of hers -or somethin' like that? - No. - Well, with who then? - Another man. [Sighs] So where's my boy? I said, "where's my boy?" - Don't scream at me like that. - Ain't nothin' worse than what you've done to me before! - Where is he? - She took him with her. Where do you think he is? Sorry. There wasn't a easier way to tell you. No, I guess there wasn't, now was there? I'm done. I just got here. And you just left. Well, I tried. [Manson] I tried to get outta there a few times. Figured I could try and find Rosie or at least see my baby boy, but they kept findin' reasons to throw me back in there. I never saw Rosie again. - That's it? - What's it? What about your son? Well, yeah. I have lots of children. That's not what I'm talkin' about. I'm talkin' about your natural son, Charles manson, Jr. Have you seen him? I haven't. I'd like to think that despite the heinous charges being brought... Heinous charges? What heinous charges? The charges you're being held in this facility for. You are aware that you're being held on charges of conspiracy in the murders of Gary hinman, Sharon Tate, and Rosemary and leno labianca. Yeah, well, now what the fuck do you think about that? Conspiracy? What kind of bullshit science fiction, made-up charge is that? Look, I didn't shoot no one. I didn't pull no trigger. I didn't stab no one. They got nothing. Well, they claim that Susan atkins told her cellmate everything. You didn't get out of jail until long after Rosalie divorced you. I tried to get out. I got out a while after that. Got myself, another wife, another kid. You haven't had contact with them either? No, man. Had to go back in for another ten-stretch. Tried to cash a check the government didn't want me to cash. You missed a lot, Charlie. Kennedy, the civil rights movement, the beginning of Vietnam. Must've been a real eye-opener when you got out after that. Nah, man. Nah, it wasn't like that at all. It was actually probably the best I felt outside of these walls. - [Hard rock music playing] - The sixties, man. The sixties changed it all. Free love and fuckin'. Now that's what I'm talkin' about. Something had definitely changed. That's when I met the mother Mary. We drove up and down that highway without a care in the world. I'd spent half of my life behind bars at that point and for the first time that I can remember freedom actually felt right to me. ♪ Whoa, look out, baby ♪ I'm letting loose... What's a pretty little thing like you doin' -sittin' out here all alone? -[Scoffs] Parents tossed you out, didn't they? See I got an insight. I see things people don't see. You wanna join us? I'll give you a minute to think about it. [Manson] Maybe it's because of the things I missed, or maybe it's because people evolve with the times, but young people were opening their eyes and questioning everything they were taught.

The devil's traditionally thought of as a fallen angel, right? A castaway... But why? I mean, why was he cast aside? [Girl] 'Cause he committed the original sin. Before Adam and Eve. You believe that? That's what my daddy told me. The devil... Was cast out because god was afraid of him. Yeah. See? You're bright. Mm-hmm. But if that's what every Bible says... No! Now that's where you're wrong. Okay? Well, I got news for you. I got news for each and every one of you in this room and everyone in the world. God and the devil? They're sittin' this one out. They're gonna come together when all is said and done. They're shakin' hands on all the ridiculous stuff people been doin' down here in both their names. See me? My uncle... My uncle told me. He said, "Charlie", you're born a rebel. You never forget that." That was when I was eight years old. Right after that, I burned down my school. They keep on tryin' to fuck with me, but you know what? I'm not gonna swallow the shit they're tryin' to feed me. I'm a rebel now. I suggest if any of you wanna survive the armageddon, you'll saddle up too. Well, hi. Hi. What's your name? Patricia. Patty. Hello, Patty. Anyone ever tell you that you're the sexiest thing they ever did see? No. I don't think anyone ever has. If they didn't, it's because they were lyin' to themselves. Either that or they were afraid. You afraid of me, Patty? You afraid of what I was sayin' earlier? I'm from a Christian family. Yeah. Well, they all are. The blind leadin' the blind. Okay, now. Don't hide your eyes. You're beautiful. [Rock music playing] [Manson] When I went in, society was still a mass of stuffed-shirt, eisenhower, "leave it to beaver" conformity where everyone combed their hair to the side and wives didn't dare speak of their husbands' infidelity. You didn't dare speak down to authority and you sure as hell didn't attempt to challenge it. But, man, when I got out, something had changed.

I'm gonna be bigger than the Beatles. All right, Charlie. Let me tell ya somethin'. I see it happen all the time. People come to this town with stars in their eyes, thinkin' it's gonna welcome them with open arms because they have arrived, right? Here's the thing. They don't know the first goddamn thing about how to be bigger than the Beatles or how to be a movie star or how to be whatever the hell they're tryin' to be. - Right. - Understand? They think they just are already because of who they are. Yeah. Right, man. Yeah, I can dig on that. See, the problem is, none of them got any real life experience. You know?

King was shot... Because peace is impossible. War's inevitable. Every attempt at equality ends with a bullet, Terry. Think about it.

Livin' off the land, away from all the fakes and frauds in I.A. Away from all the hate and the lies. Yeah, we weren't blood, but who's to say blood is what makes you family? Bobby did a stag film with gypsy. The kid was pretty good with a guitar. Squeaky found love in the land and was mother to us all. Old Tex, he was in and out but, one day, he met Leslie and stayed for a while. Some people would come and go. But some would stay for the long haul. I said I had a great family, and I was the leader. Well, let me tell you something. There was no followers and no leaders. Just a bunch of kids playing music, having fun, and spreading the gospel of love. You still talk to your family? I don't. I don't need them. Where are they? They're living their own lives and I'm living mine... With Charlie. This is my family now. And we're saved. I'm really, really glad that I came. Thank you for being so amazing. [Laughs] - Think we got enough! - Okay. You like it here, linnie? Yeah. I do. There's no hate, no fighting. No one judges you. No one ignores you. Sadie, look at that. That's a sunset. Just look at it. That's you. You got that there right now. [Laughs] What is this? Leslie, it's acid. Come on, baby. We're all doin' it. You trust me, don't you? [Chuckles] Sure. So, Charlie... When did you come out to California? Oh... a long time before you came out from Texas. I caught wind of it first. - Hey, I was a kid, man. - So, what you sayin', I'm a senior citizen? I dunno, man. You keep tellin' us you're Jesus. Jesus is old as shit, man. Yeah. That's funny. Ah, well. I can't quite remember. I get things mixed up, you know, with all my visits to prison. You goin' on vacation, man? Yeah, man. Don't you know anything? They keep a hot seat for me in prison just in case I need a place to stay for a few months. Yeah, this one I had, this visit up to mcneil up in Washington state. It's where I learned how to play guitar from a genuine gangster. Just kinda wish I had more conjugal visits, you know what I'm saying? Yeah, man, in all seriousness, though, you know, have you all heard of the "ma barker gang"? Yeah, man. I remember ma barker. Yeah, well. It was one of ma barker's gang... "creepy karpis" was his name... Old creepy was one of the only folks out here, man, that would ever help me if I asked. I told him I wanted to be a music star. Yeah, that made him laugh, but, you know he told me that he thought I was lazy. But not with the music. You know that floats through me. Since we were both visiting at the same time and I told him how I grew up in reform school he said... you know, I'll never forget this... He said that maybe it's finally time that someone did something for me. I was a quick learner, I sure was and I think that impressed him. Yeah, old creepy and I, you know, we had some really good talks. Never a hot word between the two of us. No fightin', no arguin'. Man, it's the music. I wish it was all music, you know? That's what I'm into. - Y'all like music, right? - [All] Yeah. What about you, Patty? You like my music? I love it, Charlie. I hate... I love it! [Laughs loudly] I love every part of it. What about you, Sadie? - It's gospel. - Hippie gospel. The gospel... that's what colored people sing. [Laughter] That's not what I meant. I meant... It's... divine. Divine? You think I'm god? I already know you're Jesus, Charlie. And Jesus is god. What about the devil? Y'all remember when I told you that god and the devil were gonna set aside their differences when this world came to an end? Well that time's a-comin' soon. It's comin' real soon. If you look out in the world that's what you see. You see it in the air. It's comin' you know what? We're gonna be saved. You know why that is? 'Cause I'm your savior. Sadie... Would you die for me? Would I... Will I what? Will you die for me? Yeah. Yes, Charlie, I would. I didn't say, "would you?" I said, "will you?" Yes, I will. I will, Charlie. Good. Yes. Will you die for me, Patty? I will, Charlie. I certainly will. I know you will. Leslie. Pretty, pretty Leslie. Yes, Charlie? - Will you die for me, Leslie? - Yes. I will. I... I pledge my life, and I pledge my soul to you. I would die for you. I believe you. I believe you. I know you would die for me, Leslie. I'll die for you, Charlie. I'll do anything you want me to. I love you. You never have to ask. I'll always be there. I love you, Charlie. And I love you. Now, Tex... We have the same name. Now that doesn't mean that we are the same. I gotta ask you a question, Tex. I'm gonna test your faith. You know what that question is? Yeah. Yeah, I know the question. - What is the question? - "Will you die for me?" - What was that? - [Clears throat] "Will you die for me?" One more time. "Will you die for me?" I will. I will die for you, Tex. And I will die for you, Charlie. I know you will, 'cause we're brothers and we're all family. We're out doin' the right things. Spreadin' love. Lovin' on each other. [Laughter] Do you love me? Of course I do... Since the first night I met you. Why? Your words. They way you looked at me. The way you spoke to me. The way you told me I was beautiful. My stepsister said I had to meet you. She was right. You've shown me the way, Charlie. No one ever told me I was beautiful before. No one ever loved me like you. [Laughs] [Whickers] You got a call inside. A call? Like a night call - or an animal call? - No, it's some fella named mur... melcher? Oh, ter... Oh, Terry's calling. Oh, he must be runnin' late slammin' me with that huge ol' record contract, right? Right? [Laughs] Let me tell ya, this guy loves me. This guy loves me. This is gonna be good. Hey! Hey, ter, man! Yeah. Uh-huh. Wha... Well, yeah. Well, no. Terry, I figured we'd add the full band in the full sessions. Well, why the fuck did you guys bring me out then? No, that's not what they told me. So, you're just gonna sit there and lie? That's how this works? No, man! I'm not out of control! I'm in control, man! No! You're the one that's full of shit! 2,000 years ago, god was born into a man, and that man created miracles. The enlightened ones saw this and they followed him while others persecuted him. Now, the Bible says that Jesus died for our sins. Well, in reality, Jesus died because of humans' propensity to hate. Hate against those who inspire, against those who live against the grain. If bloodshed shall occur it's par for the course. What shall we do then with Jesus who is called Christ? And at the last supper, Jesus took bread he broke it and he gave thanks. He gave it to his disciples, and he said "this is my body, given for you. Do this in remembrance of me." Again, after supper, he took the cup, he poured it. He gave thanks. He gave it to his disciples and he said, "this is my blood of the covenant," shed for you and for many. "Do this in remembrance of me." "I speak the truth when I tell you" that I will not drink from the fruit of the vine again until I am seated "next to my father in the kingdom of heaven." And then Jesus and his disciples they sang beautiful hymns as they walked to the top of the mount of olives. And his disciples were with him, because those who forsake him were at the foot of the mountain. I thought it was gonna kick-start when they shot Dr. King... But it didn't. It's because blacks can't do anything without the whites showin' 'em how it's done. Whitey, he's out fightin' pickin' fights across the world. The blacks are here killin' their heroes. Look at Malcolm X. Shot down by the very people he was speakin' up for. That's not how you win wars. You don't go killin' your heroes. You don't go turnin' them into martyrs. That just makes you as a people, as a culture, come to a boil until, finally, you reach a point, the top blows off, and you explode. This world's comin' to an end. The war is close. God and the devil, finally, are gonna set their differences aside shake hands and watch while we destroy ourselves. "Helter skelter," that's what it's called. "Helter skelter" and it's close. And we're gonna be prepared for it. We're gonna be off in the desert far away from the bloodshed when it comes this way. We'll be playing guitar and lovin' one another while the rest of the world is killin' itself. I can't wait for them to suffer. Blacks and the Jews just take, you know? They expect everyone to care and everyone pretends like this facade... This charade like they do care but they don't. They bring it on themselves. That's right. They sure do. It's all greed. That's why we live with nature. We don't need your power plants. We don't need your color televisions your iconography or your self-worship. No, we live free. Movie stars... -movie stars aren't better than me. - No, Charlie. - Oh, no. - Terry melcher? Terry melcher ain't better than me. - Fuck no! Fuck that pig! - The Beatles? The Beatles ain't better than me. Just because you're on the cover of a magazine that don't make you Jesus Christ. Mankind has reveled in self-splendor for too long. The oceans are gonna run red with blood, and the streets are gonna burn with fire. Helter skelter is coming. Helter skelter. I don't see a race war out in the streets. Y-you don't? Don't you turn on your television? That's what you fat cats do, right? Drink beer all day, watch TV. Let the TV make up your mind for you. Some do. Yeah, some people do. Not you, though. - Not me. - You're more of a thinkin' man. I like to "think" that I am. You got a way with words too. You're funny... I like that... And clever. What am I? How did you first meet Sharon Tate? You didn't answer my question. What am I? How did you first meet Sharon Tate? Oh, I see what you're doin' here. Fine, I'll play in your little game. [Scoffs] Truth of the matter is, I just went up and knocked on her door. - Did she answer? - No, she didn't answer. Someone else did. Uh, I don't know. Maybe she was suspicious or something. Why would you think that? It's crazy out that way, man. You know? This world's changin'. That's for sure. I see. I didn't know it was gonna be her that answered the door. I was lookin' for that son-of-a-bitch Terry melcher. I think he know I was comin' because he didn't live there no more. [Birds chirping] [Knocking] - Hello. - Uh, yeah. Hi. Um, I'm lookin' for Terry. - Is he around right now? - Uh, no. I don't know a Terry. I met with him here just a few months back. Terry melcher, he's good buddies with Dennis Wilson from the beach boys. I'm sorry. You're mistaken. This is the polanski residence. Oh, polanski. You mean, like, the movie people? - Like "Rosemary's baby"? - Yes. Okay. Okay, well, I see. - Who is it, shar? - It's just a man. Hi, yeah. It's Charlie. My name's Charlie. - Good afternoon, Charlie. - Good afternoon. Maybe try going through the back alley. - Back alley? - Yes, the guest house. Maybe Terry is there. I know. Check the back alley, I guess. You didn't have to be so rude to the guy. You really should be careful up here. Alone half the time with your husband halfway across the country. - It's crazy! - I'm fine. Don't worry so much. Besides, I have all these friends looking out for me. [Muttering] - Hey, Charlie. Almost got dinner ready. - Tex. Great. Tex. You're the right person. You're the one that can do this, Tex. Do what, man? What do you need? I feel it comin'. It's almost here... -helter skelter. It's on it's way. - Now? - Yeah, now. - Shit. We gotta get outta here. We gotta round up the girls and get outta here. No, we need some cash. We need to get some quick cash first. We need some quick cash for the road. All right. Uh... You know that lady I got in the city? - Louella. - Yeah, louella. - The drug dealer. - Yeah. Well, maybe she can put me in touch with one of her guys. And I'll make some kind of deal. Steal their money or somethin'. - I don't know, man. - Yeah. Yeah. Make a hustle. - We got time. - We got... yeah, we got time, - but it's comin' quick. - Okay. - All right. - All right, Charlie. I won't let you down. - All right. - I won't let you down. [Helicopter blades whirring] [Tex] Good evening, gentlemen, I got a buyer. I got one primed and waiting over in Santa Monica. Now, you give me the shit and I'll take it over to him. I'll be back in a couple hours with the cash... -minus my cut. - If you don't come back with our money... I'm gonna fuck you up. You guys will be happy. That's why we're here, right? - [Foil crackling] - [Sniffing] [Phone ringing] [Ringing continues] - Good evenin'. - Yeah, I'm lookin' for Charles. - Charles who? - The Charles that just ripped me off. - That Charles. - Look, man. This is Charles. I don't know what you're talking about. The tall ass white boy from Texas. That Charles. Look, don't think I won't find him, man. Don't think I won't find you. You help him out, that's as bad as stealin' from me. You understand? You ever heard of the black panthers? You ever heard of 'em? If you don't bring that son-of-a-bitch up here, I'm gonna come to your house and bring every black panther in I.A. county with me and gut your entire fucking family. - [Banging] - Oh! I'm all eyes, man. I'm all-seeing. I'm all-knowing. Look, man. Just listen, okay? There's just a big misunderstanding. We're gonna talk about this. Tex here tells me he couldn't find his tourist buddy and couldn't make the drop. - I couldn't find him anywhere. - See? Tried to find another buyer but it was too late. - You know tourists, man. - If he couldn't find him then he should've brought the shit right back. Don't listen to what he's sayin'. He's scammin' me. Man, he's scammin' both of us. - Don't believe this shit! - Why wouldn't I believe him? This is my friend. I brought him in my home. So you're just like him then? Another scheming, dirty-assed fuckin' hippie. You're all the same. Don't practice what you preach. You know what? - Fuck you! - [Gunshot] - [Groans] - [Laughs] Uh-uh! Don't do that! Don't do that, man! I shot your friend. Don't think I won't shoot you. He's bleedin', motherfucker! He's gonna die! You don't know that. You're not Jesus! You're not Jesus. We're the chosen ones! That's right! You do think you're Jesus? Then heal him! - Fuck you! - Can't touch us, blackie! - Fuck you! - You tell your black panther friends the war is coming! [Neil Armstrong] One small step for man. One giant leap for mankind. - Are you getting a TV picture now, Houston? -[Beep] - Wow. - It's fake. - I know it's fake. - How do you know? It is. I wrote the script. Oh, yeah? How come Roman didn't direct it then? - I mean, I could've said those lines. -[Laughing] It's top secret. You'd tell everyone. Like you're telling us now? - Oh, now I have to kill you. -[Mock gasping] Stop it. [Laughs] [Hard rock music playing] [Music continues] What the fuck? So, that mescaline you got me, didn't work out so well, man. What are you talking about, man? Get off me. Shit had me seeing way too much like reality. Reality's no good when you're lookin' for an escape. Man, if you'd stop using that shit like a goddamn junkie... Use that shit right. - That was prime shit. - Word is you got 21k floatin' around in here. What are you talking about? I got nothin'. I wonder where a guy like you would keep 20 grand? - In the mattress? - What are you talking about? In the ice box? It doesn't seem wise to me that a guy like you would keep $21,000 sitting on the counter for everyone to see. You come with us, you'll have plenty places to keep your cash - get off! - And your stash. - I got nothin'! - Think about it, Gary! Think about it! They told me to call you "Linda." I like that name. I never really thought about it much myself. Well, it means "soft." It means "tender." - I didn't know that. - You think it's true? I don't know. If there's one thing that this world needs more of, it's tenderness. - [Groans] - [Laughing] I feel like I'm in Vietnam! I've got nothing to give you. Nothing. I'm having a hard time believing you, Gary! Yeah! Look at good ol' Gary here! He's all show and no go! Is that how it is, Gary? You fuckin' with us? Is that how it really is? Huh, Gary? - You can't hear me talkin' to you? -[Laughter] - Aw! - Is that how it is, Gary? You fuckin' lyin' to us or is that how it really is? I've got nothin'! Do you read a lot? Sometimes. What do you read? I don't know. History. Philosophy. Philosophy as in thought? Philosophy as in religion? Both, I guess. Are you nervous? - No. - [Laughs softly] You scared of me? No. See, I know how it is out in the world there, you know. People judge as soon as you even get a word out of your mouth. It's not like that here. It's not like that at all. It's beautiful here. You're beautiful here. ♪ All to Jesus, I surrender ♪ ♪ All to him I freely give ♪ ♪ I will ever love and trust him ♪ ♪ In his presence daily live ♪ What are you tryin' to do to me? W-w-what? - [Breathing heavily] - [Laughing] I don't have anything to give you. You give bad drugs to people, so why would I believe anything that you have to say? Let me tell you about truth. When my mother died, my father said he would take care of my brothers and I that he'd do anything for us. - But did he? - [Gasps] No, he didn't. Instead, he drank himself to death and then he left us. I stopped going to church. And I took care of us... Provided. I did anything it took. So... When you say... That you... Are flat broke... Simply because you don't want to be held accountable for what you did to us... Well, you think we're gonna believe that? Well, now, you got more problems than anyone in this room. [Groans, gasping] Gary looks like you could use a maid around here. - This boy's a mess. - He won't give it up! I know he has it! That lyin' piece of shit! - Is that true? - Hell no, it's not true. What about the money? All your cash. [Scoffs] What cash? Your inheritance. I said where's the goddamn money? Like I been tellin' them for three days, I don't have anything! I don't have any cash! What do you want me to tell you? What do you want me to say? What do I want you to say? What do I want you to say? I'll tell you what I fucking want you to say, Gary. I want you... To stop lying... Through your teeth. [Screams] [Laughing] Take whatever you want. Make it look like blackie did it. - Oh, poor ba... horrible. - [Moaning] [Laughing] - [Groans] - [Laughs] Hold him down! Hold him down! - Push it down on his face! - I'm trying! - He's too strong! - Push him down like this! - Hold him down like this. - Okay. You can hold him down, yeah! Yeah! Hold him down. Yeah. - [Laughing] - [Groaning] - [Screaming] - [Grunting] - [Cutting flesh] - [Muffled screams] - Still moving. - [Sobbing] You know they picked up Bobby beausoleil a couple of weeks later off the 101 driving Gary hinman's fiat, right? Well, uh, what do you mean, "picked him up"? Arrested him. Oh. Well, that's a shame. Good kid. At the scene, there were what appeared to be palm prints meant to replicate the appearance of a cat's paw. You could almost say that they were meant to look like a panther paw. A black one. Ring a bell? Is this helter skelter? [Sniffs] Now's the time for helter skelter. Ol' blackie hasn't been able to do anything without whitey showin' him how. So, we're gonna go ahead and get it started. What do you want us to do? That house. The one that son-of-a-bitch melcher used to live in up on cielo drive. I want you to go up there. That's where it's gonna begin. [Sniffles] Okay, now, I want y'all to leave a sign. - Sign? - What kind of a sign? You know what I mean. Somethin' witchy. [Laughs] What did he mean? About what? "Do something witchy." [Laughing] The sooner it starts, the sooner we get our salvation. I-I don't understand. How is driving into the Hollywood Hills gonna start a war? [Laughing] It will. - Charlie knows it will. - Yes. - Helter skelter. - Helter skelter. Helter fuckin' skelter. - You know it! - That's pretty good! - I needed more wine talking than my mind talking. - Yeah, yeah. It's the wine telling the jokes now. And on that note, I'm going to bed. - Too much wine? - Ha! That's preposterous. Maybe for you, Mr. Sebring, but I have a feeling I was up a little bit earlier than you this morning. - Yeah. - Yeah, I know a little more right now than to expect Marlon to show up on time for his haircut. Or to answer the door in a timely manner. -[Laughs] Yes. - When were you at Brando's house? - Shh. - I'm afraid of being invited to Brando's house. - All the stories I've heard. - Mm-hmm. Well, gentlemen, lady. It's not a secret what I'm going to be dreaming about tonight. - Oh! - [Chuckles] - Do tell. - Good night. - Night! - Ooh! - Sharon. Sharon! - What? How are you doing? It's been a few days. Managing... despite some aches and pains here and there. Oh. When are you due? Just a couple of weeks. Can you believe it? - How's Roman doing? - He's good. Yeah. He's doing really well. He's working a lot. He's really excited. - But, um... - Is he avoiding it? Why would you say something like that? I mean, what's with all these questions? - I'm curious. - Okay. All right. He's very busy. He's working on a lot of important projects. He, um... Look, everything is fine. You know? We're gonna be just fine. - Stop. - [Gunshots] - What was that? - You heard that too? Yeah. It sounds like it's coming from down the hill. You go fetch his wallet out of the car and keep watch around back. Sure. Sure. Let's go. Friend of Jay's? Who are you? I'm the devil. And I'm here to do the devil's work. - Get up! - What? - Shit! [Screams] - Shut up! - Don't look at me. Get up! - Okay. Okay. - Go, now! You too. Up. - Come on. - Okay. - [Bashing] - Down! - Go! - [Grunting, moaning] - Don't move. [Bashing] Tex, what do we do with these guys? Tie these two together. - No. She's pregnant. - Shut up. - Just leave her alone. - Shut up! - Please don't do this. You don't need to do this. - Just let her go. - She's pregnant. - [Gunshot] - [Screaming] - Shut up! Shut up! It don't matter how much you fuckin' pigs squeal, you're all gonna die. So shut up. Now which one of you is loaded? - Huh? - [Groans] Who's got the cash? Where's the cash? Where's the money? - I do. - Show me where it is. - You got it? - [Sobbing] - Please just... -you're not gonna need it anymore. - Please don't do it. - Show me where it is. Come on. - [Groaning, screaming] - Get over here. - Shut up! - [Sobbing] [Sobbing] - [Screaming, crying] - [Stabbing] [Susan] Nice! [Sobbing, groaning] - [Crying] - Shut up. Please don't hurt my baby. - [Sobs] - It needs to live. - Let it live! Let my baby go! - Shut up! - [Sobbing] - Shut up. I'll give you money, whatever. We have money. This is all she fucking has. This is all you got? Huh? 70 fuckin' dollars? You ain't got Hollywood money? Where's your goddamn money? - [Gasping] - Fucking stab her! - [Slicing] - [Groaning] [Groaning] [Grunts] [Sobs] No! [Screaming] [Sobbing] [Screaming] Abby! Abby! [Screaming] [Choking, gurgling] [Choking] Please, please stop. [Breathing heavily] [Sobbing] I'm already dead. [Breathing heavily] [Sobbing] [Sobs] No. [Sobbing] Please, no. [Sobbing] I'm a mom. [Sobbing] - [Stabbing] - [Groaning] I didn't do that, man. Gary hinman's house had a similar m.O. I didn't do that either. I thought you were at the scene. It's ironic that they went to the house that was once occupied by a record producer that you claimed ripped you off and lied to you. Look, man. I wasn't present at the scene. - You're tryin' to implicate me. - I just want the truth. The truth is, I wasn't there. Were you at the labianca house? - I didn't kill them either. - So you were there. - I didn't say I was there. - I didn't ask if you killed them. You think I'm supposed to feel something about that? Last night was sloppy. We can't have them gettin' away. We can't have 'em screamin'. Writin' "pig" on the wall ain't gonna work, and helter skelter ain't gonna begin if someone gets away. I'm gonna show you how it's done. [Man on TV] Shirt secure. You take your string you run it through hook number one. [Groans] What you readin', honey? That poor girl. She was seven months pregnant, too. Leno, look at this! She was beautiful. Yeah. No. Stop here. Y'all, that's it. Who lives here? Come on. She was married to that director, Roman polanski. Polanski? The horror movie guy? - Yeah. - Wow. - Did we lock up? - [Knocking] It's just gotta be suzan. Come on. [Grunts] [Grunting] You hear that? No, I didn't hear anything. [Sighs] [Screaming] What's happening? You two, you go in there and you find out. Go. - Drive. - Where are we going? You and Sandy met that actor from Lebanon a couple weeks ago? - Yeah? - Head that direction. - Get out! - [Screaming continues] Get... get up! Get... Keep her quiet! [Leno] Rosie! Rosie! [Groaning] Fuck! [Grunting continues] Stop it! Stay still! - It's too dull. - What do you mean? The knife we brought, it won't go in. - [Grunts] - Give it to him. [Whimpering, screaming] [Susan] Just stand still! [Rosemary] Leno! Leno! Leno! [Muffled screams] Do something. [Gasping] Charlie said he'd do anything for you. He said he would die for you. Stab her! [Shouts] You ready for this? Okay, you two, you two go. You two go. I said, "go." So, what happened? What's it, a secret? Nothing, nothing happened. He wasn't there. You sure? Knocked on the door for five minutes, nobody answered. Well, you sure you got the right place? Yeah, I'm sure. Okay, well, let's go. Still don't feel anything? [Manson] What, do you want me to cry? Most people would be disturbed by photographs like these. I guess rebels don't cry. How many cars had the people living with you stolen? Stolen? I never stole any cars. Is that why they let you off? Are you challenging me? I'm not challenging you, I'm just asking. Well, seems they didn't have a proper search warrant. ♪ Amazing grace ♪ how sweet the sound ♪ that saved ♪ a wretch like me ♪ I once was lost ♪ but now I'm found ♪ was blind ♪ but now I see ♪ 'twas grace that taught ♪ ♪ My heart to fear ♪ and grace ♪ my fears relieved ♪ how precious did ♪ that grace appear ♪ the hour I first believed ♪ ♪ When we've been there ♪ 10,000 years ♪ bright shining ♪ as the sun ♪ we've no less days ♪ to sing god's praise ♪ than when ♪ we first begun auto theft. Anonymous tip? Yeah, apparently one of the ranch hands didn't like that we wouldn't share the girls with him, so he lied when he saw a couple of cars on the property. He was jealous and greedy. I don't like that. Nothing wrong with wanting more. It's the American dream. That's what's driving Americans to the apocalypse. See? Greed, hate, and jealously. It's a lot like when you told everyone that you were going to be bigger than the Beatles, isn't it? - What was that? - The American dream? Don't implicate me, man. I don't like lies, and I don't like the people that tell them. I'm trying to determine if I can adequately represent you. - By demeaning me? - By analyzing you. Look, man, I'm not a psychiatric patient. I'm not a psychiatrist. - Don't mess with me, man. - I'm not. "When I plunged the knife in her, it made me have an orgasm." Those are your words. Were you present at the Tate killings? Yes. Were you involved? [Chuckles] Susan, we got all night. Were you involved? I got in the car with everyone. Charlie told us to do something witchy. He instructed you to go to cielo drive? Yes. To kill Sharon Tate? Whoever was there. I went into her bedroom, brought her to the living room, she was... Pleading with us not to kill her. She wanted to live long enough to have her baby. She kept crying, and crying. Crying for her mother. So I stabbed her. I tasted her blood. It made Charlie happy. If you're any kind of lawyer, man, you'd be trying to get me out of here instead of asking me question after question. I have to make a fair assessment of you before we go to trial. We're not getting to trial. - Why's that? - I'm a free man. Doesn't look that way to me. Well, your perception of free is different than mine. I'm not the one sitting there in the same suit and the same briefcase as everyone else out there. You're a slave. I'm the free man. I'm not behind bars. The way you live your life is your prison. What would you know about my life? You wanna know why I'm better? Doubt me again when you've sat on a bench with someone for almost a year who you know killed someone's wife or child, when you've had to cross-examine a young widow who watched your client murder her husband before her very eyes, and you tell her she's wrong. I didn't hurt anyone. Then why are you here? I don't know. Wrong place, wrong time. I don't think I can represent you. [Scoffs] Why not? I'm innocent. I didn't do anything to those people in the Hollywood Hills, I didn't touch those people in los feliz. Not that simple, doesn't work that way. I didn't kill anybody. I don't even know why I'm in here. Because people are dead, Charlie! They're dead because you sent people to their house to take their lives. And why? Because you're not a rock star. Fuck you man, fuck you! Those kids would do anything for you, and you deceived them and manipulated them for your own self-pity! And you wonder why you're here? You really think that these people are your friends? Your family? We're not family, man. We're not a cult, or any other of those fucking labels anyone wants to put on us, okay? We're friends. We're friends. They would do anything for me, and I would die for them, I would die for those people. I gave them a place, I gave them direction. You know why? Because you threw them out like trash. And we deserve more, we deserve more than you. Fuck you! They're your friends, - you really believe that. - I do. Well, one of your friends told her cellmate everything... About helter skelter, about you, about everything. Looks like you're alone again, Charlie. [Uncle] You mad at your mama? She can't help what she is. People are who they are. And they do what they're gonna do. Niggers do what they do, Jews do what they do. You can't change people, Charlie. You can't change who they are. You were born a rebel, Charlie, and don't you ever forget it.
