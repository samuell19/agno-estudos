Hey! Come and look down here. Come on, quickly. I've located the main channel. It runs straight for 40 feet before branching off to the left and right. - Which way? - The left seems to pinch off. I'd say the right. You'll need the pitons. - Let's not waste time. Let's go in. - I'll go first. Main channel. Come on, Cliff. How goes it, Cliff? All right. I've reached the bottom of my section. I'm trying to find a... Okay. Look, there's a bend here. Yeah, but it's wide enough for me, okay? I'm going through it. Hey, somebody having fun? Okay, I'm down. It's about a 20-foot drop. I'll be right with you. I never expected this. This is a breathing cave. No footprints. We could be the first humans down here. - Yeah. Let's look around. - But watch it. - I'm afraid it's a dead cave. - Shut up. Listen. Water. Could be a deep underground stream. Possibly a branch of the river. - Must run under this range. - I wonder what's behind there. There's one way to find out. I'm gonna have a look. Well, there's headroom enough here, but the roof might slope down further on. Yeah. I wouldn't chance it. Oh, don't worry about it. I'll only go as far as I can. I wanna see where the water leads to. Well, I don't know about you, but this seems more like a job for the subaqua boys. Don't let them in on this. We discovered it, but they'd get the credit. Not this time. Hey! - Cold? - It's like ice. Probably fed by subterranean glacial waters. - Give me the torch. - Here, take mine. Well, here goes. Hey. Do you realize Bill could carve his name among explorers? Be the first to find a new channel. He's got a chance to make history. - And we could be part of it. - Don't get carried away. You're both crazy. Well, how about you, then, Malcolm? You led the way. I'll admit, I'm curious. But I'm not joining in. I know when to stop. - Only a fool would go... - If this is how you feel... ...from now on, it's Bill and me, all right? All right. Go ahead, it's your funeral. - Here. Take the torch. - Right. Okay so far. I think I'm through. I can't see everything with this torch, but what I do, it looks terrific. It wouldn't surprise me if we were the very first. I'm getting chills down my spine. Bill! Bill. Bill! Oh, God. Bill! Bill, what's the matter? What's wrong? Malcolm! - What happened? - We gotta get out of here. - Where's Bill? - He's dead, he's dead! Dr. Selbourne. Inspector. I'd like to speak to Dr. Brockton. Now. It's important. Yes, of course. Dr. Brockton, Inspector Greenham is here. He wants to talk to you. It's urgent. I'll see him at once in my office, Dr. Selbourne. You know the way, inspector. Come in, inspector. Dr. Brockton, it is imperative that I talk to your patient. I'm afraid I can't permit that. He's under sedation. With one man dead and a man wounded, you've got to help. Believe me, inspector, I am not trying to hamper your investigation. If possible... ...I'm even more interested than you in everything you can find. - In that case, I'd advise you to cooperate. - To the fullest. May I suggest something? Why don't you talk to his friend, Malcolm Travers? He was the leader of this freelance expedition. He was there at the time of the accident. Very well. Dr. Selbourne, would you please ask Mr. Travers to come into my office? Has the coroner's report come through? Not yet. Dr. Brockton, would you please have a look at Cliff right away? Malcolm, Inspector Greenham would like to ask you some questions. I've just given him another injection, doctor. - That's fine, Cleo. I'll look after him. - Yes, doctor. The eyes. The eyes and the face. - They won't leave me. - You're quite safe now. You must try to relax. I can't. Can't. I have terrible nightmares. Perhaps if you'd tell me exactly what happened... ...what you saw, you'd feel better. Horrible. Horrible. That face. - Those eyes. - Cliff. Please, try to describe it. Monstrous. Like nothing I've ever seen before. Cliff, try to describe it. You're the only one who saw it and survived. Listen to me. Please. How large was it compared to a human? Did it walk upright? Did it crawl? Did it make sounds? If so, were they sounds like the human voice? - Leave me alone. - Did it...? Leave me alone. Where is this cave? Near the Salton Marshes. This particular fissure's a new one. We came upon it accidentally. What makes you think that you discovered it? For one thing, it's not on the map. I've been over this entire region before and it's the first time... Sit down, sit down. You make a practice of poking your nose into these potholes? It's my hobby. And it ties in with my studies. Did you actually see your friend killed? No, sir. But I heard his screams. And then I heard Cliff scream. Bloodcurdling screams. Why didn't you notify us immediately? Dr. Brockton was closer. I thought it was more important to get help for my friend. A chance to save his life. How is the patient? Still in shock. Let me know the moment I can talk to him. I'll ask you not to leave the district without telling me. Dr. Brockton. You still in university? Yes. Final term. I'm reading zoology. In fact, Dr. Brockton, I've read your book... ...Social Structures in Primates, several times. Well, I thought that after graduation that I might even have a chance... ...to work here with you. Well... ...since the police want you here, that opportunity might come very soon. I can always use trained assistants. I don't have to tell you, though... ...that people on the outside think all scientists are a little deranged. Yes, I've run into that. Then try and help me now. Whatever it was your friend Cliff saw down there horrified him. He couldn't describe it, not in detail. Perhaps you can. You know, sometimes, under stress and panic... ...imagination plays tricks. Not in this case. What do you base that on? I know Cliff. We need more than that to convince a skeptical world. This situation needs absolute proof. Cliff kept talking about something he had seen in that cave. Something that terrified him. Almost as if it had escaped from another world. An animal, perhaps. He kept repeating: "Like I have never seen." Tell me, did you see it? No. I did not. Yet whatever it is, it must exist. It's still there, trapped. I have to see it. Malcolm, I must go into that cave before the police. But, doctor, you can't. It's much too dangerous. As a young scientist, you must know the answer. This could be the one chance in a lifetime. Who knows? An opportunity to lift the veil from the past. There's air coming in. Over to the left. There's another cave behind there. We've gone as far as we can. I'm still not impressed. They can make a fool out of you, doctor, but not me. I took that picture with my own camera. Developed it in my own darkroom. To me, it looks like something out of a student's rag week. You're a university man, aren't you? - I am, yes. - Admit it, this is a stunt. No, sir. You say no because the stunt ended in someone getting killed. I say no because it was real. I was there. Malcolm, we're two eyewitnesses against a blind man. Perhaps we'd better send for Scotland Yard. I'll do that when or if I think it's necessary. Then please keep an open mind. Or do you still cling to the theory that the students, as a hoax... ...constructed this monster? Concealed it in this cave to commit murder? Now, does that sound logical to you? It's my job to pursue and check out all possibilities. However... ...having examined this again, I... I must admit, it does look like... Something from another age, inspector? Say, 10 million years ago? When some of our ancestors, like the gorilla, the ape and the baboon... ...were beginning to leave the forests and jungle... ...learning to walk upright... ...and crystallize into some kind of resemblance to the Neanderthal man. Please, doctor, I can't match your book learning. I can only go by what I can see. Then take a look at it again, and carefully. Yes, let me offer that photograph as evidence. A perfect example of a trog. - What? - A troglodyte. - What the devil are you talking about? - Half man, half ape. Trog: A primitive cave dweller. Cave dweller? Down there in that cave, the greatest scientific find of modern civilization. And that picture verified it. Facts, inspector. We're going to have to face them. And since lots of people have gotten wind of this... ...you're also going to face publicity. This kind of news inflames curiosity everywhere. So you'd better be prepared... ...because the whole world will want to know all about our discovery. The first thing they'll want to know... ...is how the hell he survived for thousands of years in that cave. Can you answer that? And as I stand around these usually lonely and deserted moors... ...I'm surrounded by great activity. As you see there, near the entrance to the caves... ...a team of men, including frogmen and our cameraman... ...have gone down to investigate. C, Charlie, H, hotel... Damned outrage. Trash spectacle, cheap publicity. All this riffraff gives our town a bad name. Better enjoy it while you can, mister. And below us, who knows? Perhaps some poor devil who tried to play a practical joke that misfired... ...or break a record for living underground. Or is it something else? Something from another age. Either way, whichever it is, he's trapped. Inspector, what are the chances of getting this fellow out? Inspector Greenham doesn't appear to be in the mood. He's too busy. - Inspector. Inspector. - Yes, Mr. Murdock? Isn't there some way to stop this Roman holiday? These shenanigans make a fool of all of our citizens. Until a law's been broken, there's nothing I can do. - Besides, Dr. Brockton's opinion... - Her opinion means nothing to me. I never did care for the experiments that go on in her research center. All it amounts to is taxpayers' money down the drain. There's Dr. Brockton, the famous anthropologist. I'm sure she can explain some rumors and enlighten us. I can try. We understand that you've been inside the caves. Indeed I have. And have you seen this creature, this practical joker or whatever they call...? She saw nothing. The whole thing's a hoax. A cruel joke on this township. Whatever I saw... And for the record... ...everything I saw was verified and captured by my camera. - It is all fully detailed in my report to the police. Thank you. And you, sir, Mr. Malcolm Travers. Will you tell us what you saw? I can attest to everything Dr. Brockton has said. I was with her when she took the photographs. They certainly tell their story. Thank you. Frogmen have cleared the underground stream. As John Dennis is there with our cameraman... ...I'll switch you over to them. Over to you. How is it? Hello, Alan. Well, as you know, the subaqua team are here with us... ...and things are going fine. Our first man, Major Simpson, is just about to... Oh, we seem to have lost contact. Well, until we get news from the subaqua team... ...I'll return you to Alan Davis on the surface to see if he... No, wait. There's some activity in the stream. Yes, I can just see the... Oh, no. Oh, my God. Paul, get out of there! Alan. My God, he's coming up. Get onto Division, quick. Use emergency procedure. - Tell them I want extra men at once. - Yes. Wait. Tell them I want arms issued first. - Clear this area! - That's right. Shoot it. Get rid of it. Don't you dare. You kill it, and you may be destroying the most valuable scientific evidence... ...we have in existence today. Don't listen to any crackpots, inspector. You know your duty. Thompson, get your men, quick. Hurry. We need a net. Malcolm, get my case out of the car quickly. I don't know how long this tranquilizer will keep him harmless. We must get him back to my lab before the effects wear off. Trog. Trog. Anne, we must feed him before the reporters and leading citizens descend on us. - Can't you put them off? - No. Afraid not. People have a right to know what's happening. The press is very important. Well, you can't say we've been neglected. We've been gathering reams of publicity. Yes. And for that, we should be grateful. We need the public on our side... ...to give us a fighting chance to really study and classify Trog. What's on the menu for Trog? It's right here. Fish and lizards. Raw? You don't think they had stoves a million years ago, do you? Is that the ideal diet for Trog? For the present, yes. Trog is not a carnivore. Fish and lizards will supply the proteins he needs... ...until we can safely expand the range of his feeding. Trog. Here, Trog. Good boy. Not so fast, you'll get a tummy ache. Go ahead, Anne, feed him some fish now. For a senior citizen, he certainly has a marvelous appetite. More? Aren't you getting too close? He doesn't frighten me a bit. That's right, Anne, darling. Never show fear, only trust. Good morning. Good morning, gentlemen. - Dr. Brockton. - Good morning, John. Good morning, Dr. Brockton. Dr. Brockton, now that you've captured this creature... ...can we have a good look at him? Only under these conditions: You do nothing to startle Trog and keep your distance. Then you do admit he's dangerous. Nonsense. I'm allowing my own daughter to feed him. Just because you're reckless, there's no reason for us to join in. I'd like you to tell the public that this whole abomination is hurting business. It's ruining my plans for a housing project. Nobody wants to buy land with an ugly demon running loose. And after you have observed him for another day or two? We'll need much more time. Don't count on it. Much more time. Before the law can take any course... ...we must have a chance to ascertain what it is. It's a monster, that's what it is. On behalf of the taxpayers, I demand you get rid of it without delay. Not so fast. We believe Trog could be the connection between the creatures of early civilization... ...and man as we know him today. This troglodyte, who somehow survived as a living reminder... ...of what happened after our ancestors, the apes, left the forest... ...and first started to walk on hind legs and take shelter in the caves. Aren't you oversimplifying? The study of anthropology supports me. After a few more eons, the creatures developed a brain. Physically and mentally, he became the early shape of man. How does this relate to him? It's my firm belief that Trog is the missing link. And the prime objective of our program will be to gradually pull Trog... ...across the time span right into the heart of the 20th century. Sounds like an impossible task. Just the same, we must try. It's our sacred as well as scientific duty... ...to study this creature with complete dedication... ...and search out the truth. Nothing will prevent that. Poppycock. Insane nonsense. You would exterminate anything you didn't like or understand. What gives you the authority to sentence a living creature to death? What? In the book of Genesis, it says very clearly: Let us make man in our image after our likeness. This is a monster. It must be destroyed. You've conveniently forgotten Deuteronomy, the second commandment: Thou shalt not kill. So this is the missing link. Hi, Grandpa. That's not so far-fetched. Just take a look in the mirror. If he's as old as you say he is, how did he survive? - That's exactly what I'd like to know. - I can only give you an hypothesis. Conceivably, Trog was frozen solid during the long, long glacial age. A state similar to cryogenic suspension. Then as the underground streams and currents brought more and more warmth... ...to the frozen atmosphere, his body thawed out. We now know that human sperm, red blood cells, bone marrow cells... ...even skin, can be brought back to life after freezing. You make it sound too simple. Can you come up with a better explanation? Research will support it. What I described is the life cycle of Trog. Birth, eons ago, then a long, long period of total icy hibernation. And now, if you please, his rebirth. It seems docile enough now. You idiots! You were given strict instructions not to use flashlights. - Goodbye, doctor. - Goodbye. Do you intend to print all this bilge about the monster? My job is not to edit. My job is to report what I see and hear. Inspector. If you refuse to do your clear duty, which is to get rid of this horror... ...I shall call a town meeting. - Now, look. Mr. Murdock, whatever my personal feelings, I can't take any action. Until there's a clear ruling from the court. No, Trog, no! Not so hard, Anne. And more patience. Trog has had more than his share of hysteria and brutal suspicion. We must try a different kind of treatment. Encourage friendly communication, expression. - The human touch. - I'm sorry, Mother. It's okay. Let's try a different kind of toy. - That's fine, Trog. - Be careful, Mother. Don't worry. He understands. Let me have it, Trog. Give it to me, Trog. Let me have it. Come on. That's fine, Trog. Anne. We have to teach him how, Anne, to wind it up by himself. Remember, we're dealing with a backward child. Surely we can teach him by example. Yes, I see. Now give it to Trog. Give it to him. - Good boy, Trog. - Look how fast he learnt that. You see, dear, now that you show more patience, you can reach him. Change the record, Anne. Isn't that wonderful? Look at him react. - You've got him eating out of your hand. - Well, as the man said: "Music hath charms that soothes the savage breast." Trog. Look at this. This is blue. Blue. Blue. Show him another color, Dr. Selbourne. This is green, Trog. Green. He seems to recognize that color. This is red. Trog! Trog, stop it. That's wonderful, Trog. That's wonderful. I suppose it does add up to considerable progress. Dr. Selbourne, we won't need you here. I'd much rather you finish the experiment on organic materials. Especially copepods. And put the report on my desk. Yes, of course, Dr. Brockton. - Thank you. - Thank you. I'm glad you could have this quiet drink with me, Dr. Selbourne. Nice of you to ask me, Mr. Murdock. - Water? - No, thank you. These days, I'm afraid I don't draw very much attention. I know what you mean, and I think it's a bloody shame. That female quack has made herself the star of the whole show. You'd think the sun rises and sets on Dr. Brockton. No doubt about that. Ever since Trog appeared in that miserable cave. We've had nothing but trouble. Humiliation and trouble. At least, that's how I look at it. How about you? I quite agree. While this circus goes on, the real work of the clinic is being neglected. Is that true? Yes. Not that I haven't called her attention to it. You have? Yes, indeed, but she has her name on the clinic. She runs the place. I wouldn't think that you'd fancy... ...knuckling under to a woman. Taking orders. Being at the beck and call of a shining egotist... ...with a monster under her wing. You're absolutely right, Mr. Murdock. Would you believe she has this creature dancing to music like a trained bear? Blinking at colors. Winding up toys, doing all sorts of crazy stunts. We must put a stop to it. The situation calls for a change. I would much rather see a dignified, qualified man at the head of a clinic. Someone levelheaded, with both feet firmly on the ground. - Another drink? - Thank you. Our next step is to teach Trog to retrieve the ball. His first lesson in initiative. You know, I wonder what would happen... ...if I roll the ball to him. Let's try it, huh? Trog. No. Oh, no, no, Trog. No. Now, come on, don't rip it up. Come on, throw it back to me. Throw it back to me. Come on. No. Throw it back to me. Come on. Good boy, Trog. Good boy. Now, Anne. We must teach Trog to make the first move. Trog. Now, you roll it back to me. There you are. Come on. Roll it back. Trog, roll it back to me. Come on. Anne. Good boy. Good boy. Come on. Roll it back to me. Good boy, Trog. Now again. My hypo-gun. Quick. This court of inquiry is now in session. Now, this inquiry is being conducted in the public interest... ...as a result of certain charges and complaints made by citizens... ...who've supplied me with some facts... ...newspaper cuttings and photographs. It concerns the survival of a certain brutish creature... ...now lodged in the research center. May I respectfully suggest, sir, that you haven't heard our side? In due time, Dr. Brockton. I should like to hear from Inspector Greenham first. Sir. It is my opinion, after consultation... ...that the subject is covered by Section 211 B of the code: "Under statutory regulations... ...any nondomestic, untamed animal of a predatory nature... ...which has caused, or is liable to cause, injury or damage, must be destroyed." I submit that we can definitely establish that the creature in question is... ...in fact, an animal. First, it kills like an animal. Under the very supervision of Dr. Brockton and her daughter Anne... ...it killed a shepherd dog belonging to a neighbor. This creature has killed, has terrorized our town... ...so the people are afraid to leave their homes. Why is it allowed to live? Sir, may I please be permitted to explain that? Indeed you may, Dr. Brockton. And how do you answer these charges? This so-called creature, a troglodyte... ...must be allowed to live in the interest of science. The discovery of Trog in our regional caves has traveled around the world. Excited the interest in every functioning scientist. Our research center has been bombarded by cables... ...from the most famous scientists alive today. They're on their way here to study Trog. We dare not destroy him now. Kill it first, then study its hide. Mr. Murdock, I order you to control yourself. When I reach my decision, all parties concerned will know it. Please continue, Dr. Brockton. To begin with, Trog is not an animal. His classification is close to human. If he's human, what's to prevent him standing trial as a mature person? Sir, would you charge a child? A retarded child who responds only on instinct... ...with the responsibilities of his own acts? There are many points that must be taken into consideration. Not the way I see it. Mr. Murdock, I order you not to interrupt. Where is this creature now, Dr. Brockton? In a cage in our lab. - Is it guarded? - Day and night. No danger of escape, then? None. None whatsoever. And why do you and other scientists... ...bestow so much importance upon this creature? Trog can help us piece together the history of human behavior. In Trog's mind are secrets. Secrets of man's origin and development that go back millions of years. And however difficult... ...however great the risks, we must try to unlock his mind. That's the talk of a heathen. It is the consensus of all educated belief. Nearly everyone accepts the Darwinian proposition... ...that man's physical form evolved from lower animals. Give us a chance to study Trog and we shall have proof. You shall also have murder and the mockery of the world. And if my word is not enough... ...why don't you listen to someone whose qualifications cannot be questioned? I am referring to Dr. Selbourne... ...who is on the staff of Dr. Brockton's research center. - Dr. Selbourne. - Yes? I take it you agree with these rather violent views expressed by Mr. Murdock? - Fully. - And how long have you held these views? Ever since the first day that horrible creature was discovered. The important work of our clinic has been gravely neglected... ...while time and money have been lavished on a training program... ...which can end in nothing but disaster. Did you ever voice any objection or criticism to Dr. Brockton? Well, not exactly. Dr. Brockton is a difficult person to oppose. But you found a way to do it. Your Honor, I consider Dr. Selbourne's conduct treachery. Quiet. I want no demonstration here. Now, for the present, I've heard enough. It will take me a few days to resolve these facts and assertions. In the meantime, Dr. Brockton, I charge you with the full responsibility... ...of keeping this creature secure. If he breaks loose or in any way becomes a menace to the community... ...I shall order him to be destroyed. Dr. Selbourne. There's no need for you to return to the lab. Well, you've seen Trog's progress from the time of capture. What next, doctor? Well, before we proceed... ...I'd like to tell you how excited and grateful I am... ...that you could take the time out of your busy lives to be with me here today. Scientists of all nations have a common cause. I consider it a privilege to be here. Thank you, professor. You know, in an age when man can launch an expedition to the moon... ...I think we should clarify the history of man's origin. And now... ...the world-renowned American surgeon Dr. Warren will take over. Dr. Warren. Swab. Scalpel. Micro-trans. All right. Clean it up. Put a tape right around his chest so he can't reach the ends. What's the range of that transistor, Dr. Warren? "Micro-trans," we call it. It has functioned up to half a mile. A very useful development that makes it possible for us... ...to monitor intensive-care units... ...and check up on the patient's heartbeats from a central control. Saves a lot of time and staff. Dr. Warren, here are the results of your first tests. How soon can we take the next step? - I thought you'd need this. - Thanks. Dr. Brockton? The oscillograph. His pulse rate has risen. Keep a record of the beat. We'll be right in. Right. Can we move on to the final stage now? We're ready, Dr. Brockton. It's a big step... ...but if the operation is successful, Trog will be able to talk. We have something. Pentothal, quickly. Anne. Red. Green. Blue. - He spoke. - Anne. Trog spoke. - Fantastic. - Unbelievable. Yes. Trog spoke. We shall now resume the inquiry on behalf of public interest. - It's a waste of taxpayers' money. - Mr. Murdock... ...I caution you not to interrupt these proceedings. - I should like to hear from you, Dr. Brockton. - Thank you. I'm pleased to report, sir, that as a result of our experiments... ...and a successful operation... ...we've been able to endow Trog with the power of speech. So the monster speaks. And with your permission, sir, I would like to have this verified... ...by the renowned American scientist Dr. Richard Warren. Dr. Warren. It's quite true, sir, and quite astounding. What took place in Dr. Brockton's research center was an important step. A breakthrough in science. Also, sir, may I direct your attention to copies of the reports... ...from Dr. Kurtlimer of Germany, Professor Manoskiensky of Russia... ...and Dr. Duval of France. They participated with us in this experiment. Yes, well, I shall... Yes, I shall read these later. And if I may add, praise for the courage and initiative of Dr. Brockton... ...will be echoed in all civilized countries. Would you say, then, that you are at the end of your studies? No. Only at the beginning. Now that Trog has learned how to talk... ...we're trying to teach him new words every day. He will soon be able to articulate his memories... ...and then the entire world will learn the baffling secrets of evolution. It's a scheme to milk us dry, to make a sacred cow out of a murdering monster. Constable, will you please eject Mr. Murdock? I'll call the Home Office, that's what I'll do. The prime minister will hear this. Don't you dare touch me, young fellow. You know what they'll say? They'll say that Trog has a very nasty temper. But what can you expect... ...from a slimy beast? Go ahead, missing link. If that's what you are, you should be missing. You bloody monster! Malcolm. Get me my hypo-gun, quickly. Trog, stop it! Trog! Now, then. These woods. Come on, if you're coming. These woods run from this point here down to the edge of Blesdoe Corners. Now, there's only one path through the woods... ...and it leads down to the village. After the arrival of Colonel Vickers and his men... ...and after arms are issued, I want six men here... I hope some of you are taking this down. I want six men here. I want 10 men by the railway junction. Four men here in case he breaks through to the southeast. This won't leave us many men in reserve. - Morning. - Morning. Ready for another long day? Yeah, looks like it's gonna be a good one today, eh? What do you think you're doing? Get it off! Let me down! Get off! Let me down! Let me down! No, no, no. No. No, no. No, no. No, please. No. No. Come along. Hurry up. Come along. All right, Division. Yes, go ahead. We're looking into that, got it all covered. - Yes, right. Right. Over and out. - Easy with the charges. Inspector, I warned you he'd head for his natural habitat, the caves. I think, Dr. Brockton, we've had just about enough advice from you. - Colonel, may I please point out something? - What is it? What worries me is if Trog gets into this chimney. - Which chimney? - There. You see that narrow, perpendicular tunnel in the rocks? Now, it leads to the first cave. Now, once he manages to get through there... It's all your fault. I heard Mr. Murdock at the public inquiry. He was right. He wanted to do away with your monster then... ...but you wouldn't let him. - If anything happens to my little girl, I'll... - Please, madam. Come on, now. Come on. We're doing everything we can. Dr. Brockton. Dr. Brockton, that chimney you pointed out. Right there. Are the figures on the map correct? I mean, correct in proportion? I believe so. Well, I can't have my men climbing down one by one. We'll need a direct, unobstructed entrance to the cave. Water. Water. Inspector, I beg you to let me go in that cave alone. If I can only talk to Trog... ...there's an even chance I can bring that child out safely. You've had your chance with this monster and you failed. Look, Dr. Brockton, do you realize just what you're coddling? What this thing has done to us? The whole community terrorized, people brutally murdered... ...and now this innocent child. Blame Sam Murdock. It was his fiendish idea to let Trog loose. - He's been punished for that. - But that doesn't satisfy you. You want another sacrifice. The world knows we were making progress. We've seen its results in wreckage, in blood, in killings. Maybe you scientists know how to strike some kind of balance... ...human life on one scale and so-called progress on the other. We can't. Missing link or not, it's a killer. It's a menace to everyone. It's got to be destroyed. Sergeant, bring your men over here. Stay where you are, Dr. Brockton. That's an order. Dr. Brockton! Trog! Please, Trog... ...let me have the child. Trog, come on. Come on. Please, Trog. I want you to let me have the child. Come on, Trog. I want you to give me the child. Please? Thank you, Trog. Mummy. Mummy. - Darling. Oh, you're safe. - Mummy. Mummy. You're back. Oh, let me look at you. You see, colonel, Trog can be reasoned with. I implore you to let me go back with my hypo-gun. Keep Dr. Brockton away. - Is the demolition squad ready? - Ready, sir. Doctor. Dr. Brockton. Now that the troglodyte has been destroyed... ...have you anything to say?
