NETFLIX PRESENTS ...economic in Mexico, fostering the Free Trade Agreement... War, revolution. 1994. ...we're not happy with political incompetence... The death of Luis D. Colosio, candidate for the presidency, was confirmed... Attention... he's gonna shoot... Goal! - José Miguel! - What? This is the World Cup! I need you to help me organize the move! - José Miguel... - Coming, Mom! Don't touch your grandparents' things, okay? No! MEXICO CITY, 1994 And if you do touch something, don't break it, okay? Yes, Mom! How's everybody? We're just a few days from the World Cup of 1994, and hope is in all the hearts of Mexico. We have a new generation of players that have a winning state of mind. Like Zague, who scored seven goals in a single match. We can win this, my friends! Let's finish up with this song, which goes... Water, 104° Fahrenheit. And six medians. We have the adequate resistance. Two more minutes, tops... José Miguel! José Miguel Montes Palermo, let's go! After Torreón, we moved to Chihuahua. I'm tired of moving so much. Especially because of the kids. Poor things. I hope we can settle here, since we have friends, like you. I'll help you. Thank you so much. We thought he wouldn't be able to finish the year. No need to thank me, I'm glad to have you all here. José Miguel is so happy to finally meet you. Right, honey? - You look so much like your father. - Damn! Excuse him, we've been a little tense from all the traveling. You're going to need this, boy. Honey, I put some water in there, Letty drank your juice. Honey! Mom! You forgot your lunchbox, sweetie! Damn! Just like his father. Hey, come here! What is it? - Look at that. - Is he for real? - What is he thinking? - What grade does he think we're in? - You should all... - Good morning, Miss Yolanda. - Good morning, Headmaster. - Good morning. Good morning, Professor Imenecio. I want to introduce you to José Miguel Mota. I'm sure many of you have heard his father's name somewhere around the school. From now on, and for the rest of the year, José Miguel is going to be here with us. Miss Yolanda, please take good care of him. We’ll talk later. Not a problem, sir. We'll take good care of him. Right, buddy? You can put your little lunchbox over there, and then, come sit over here, please. As I was saying, it's important for you all to review the last chapter. We're not babies anymore. We're in middle school. All the questions in the test will be from that chapter. So don't be surprised later, okay? I need you to sharpen up. Your final grade will depend on this. Let's start reviewing again, we'll begin with capital cities. I'm Liliana. I'm an inventor. Cool lunchbox, dude. Let's see... Malo, come up front, please. Malo! Hurry up, we don't have all day, daddy-o. Listen, Malo, point at Norway. GEOGRAPHY - MISS YOLANDA POLITICAL DIVISIONS OF THE WORLD When will you learn, daddy-o? Thanks. Now point to Canada. He doesn't know where Canada is? This is his third time repeating freshman year. - Let's go! - Come on! - ...on TV... - Don't be stubborn, Terrazas. - The World Cup starts today. - We're gonna lose. Don't say that! It's a deadly team! - Look who's coming. - The new guy. Oh yes, I know. Look at his lunchbox. Do you know who his father is? No clue. I've heard his last name, Mota, but I have no idea who he is. I hadn't even heard it. According to Imenecio, he's a legend in this school. A famous person at the Nelson Mendoza School. - Yes, but... what is it? - Wait. Can't you see? I can't walk! She's going to be my girlfriend... She's going to be my girlfriend. In your dreams. That's Cristina Palazuelos. Guys in senior year come here just to look at her. She'll be my girlfriend. Come here, defense! Center pass, center! See that guy over there? Yes, ahead! - That's Kenji Matarazzo. - Come! He's Italian, but he has a Japanese grandfather that taught him Karate. In fact, they call him Kenji Karate Kid. Him and Christina have been together since middle school. They're never going to break up. Everyone knows it. Cristina will be my girl. When is her birthday? What, you're going to give her a lunchbox like yours? Why did Imenecio say that about your dad? He's an idiot. They were together in school. When is her birthday? June 20th, everyone knows that. The new guy is very weird. Yes, and he's also very small. He's nice. Let's start our dictation. The title is: Worker Politics and Oil Expropriation. "After strengthening his rule, comma..." That cake is rotten. "...General Cárdenas, comma..." Really? "...had to control the excessive demands from workers, comma, without turning them down..." Hey! Can I have a bite? - No. - Was that clear? Was that clear, Angulo? No, sir. Sorry. Could you repeat it? "...because his government was, comma..." - Hi. - What's your name? - I'm Carmina. - And you? - Me, too. - I'm José Miguel. - We know. - Yes, Liliana told Carmina, Carmina told me, I told Tacita. Tacita told Bolabola, Bolabola told Calcipato. - Why don't you sit behind us? - How lame. Let's go. Please. - Do you like rap? - Do you? No, rap stinks. I think so too. What is that? A pen that blows out smoke. - You smoke? - No. - Want some? - No. - Are you really an inventor? - Yes. - What have you invented, or what? - Special objects. Like? What's that? You wouldn't understand. - Invite me for lunch at your place. - When? Today. Or do you have to ask your mom for permission? Of course not! - ...the group... - Mom, stop it. Italy, Ireland and Norway... Those Norwegians are very tall! Is Mexico going to win? I hope so, sweetie. I hope your dad makes it in time to watch it with us. Mom, look! Zague! Letty, please don't call, that's too expensive. ZAGUE'S NUMBER Why are we always in the deadliest group? There you go. Go get dressed. What's this? It converts sounds into images, and images into sounds. - Does it work? - No. - What about this? - No clue. - Does it work? - No. And this? Look... I solve the puzzles on the cereal box too quickly. But with this, each time I eat cereal, I can solve another one. It's incredible. - Do you really mean it? - Yes. Look, I want to give you something. That's the coolest rock in the world. You'll become a better person just by hearing it. Thanks. THE BEST ROCK It's cool. - Is that your dad? - Yes. - Does he ever come for lunch? - No. Never, he's a pilot. What's up with this house? It's weird. - It's my grandparents'. - Where are they? They died. See you. Hi, you're calling the National Team's phone line. Press the number for your favorite player so you can talk to them. Hello, I'm your friend, Luis Roberto Alves Zague. - Pleasure talking to you. - Letty... What would you like for your birthday? A ball autographed by Zague. Not that, something else. I need Zague's trading card. No, not Zague. A lollipop, maybe? - Not that either. - What then, José Miguel? - Just go! - Damn! I'll tell mom you were talking to Zague. JUNE MAY Letty, again on the phone? No, Mom, it's not true. Not true? I'm watching you. - No, Mom, I'm not speaking. - That call is going to be expensive. But I could hear Zague's voice! Yes, honey, but you're going to have to pay it with your allowance. But, Mom, you don't get it! Do you want me to hate you? I can hate you! I can hate a lot of people if I want to. Letty, your glasses. You broke your glasses, honey. Mom. Hi, sweetie. What should I get a girl for her birthday? Why not a cupcake, sweetie? No, Mom, something else. One of your inventions? That cube is really cool. Why would she want that? Give her something special, sweetie. What did Dad give to you? - Come with me. - Okay. Do you want some dinner? - Yes. - Let's go. Operation Cristina. I'm missing reels. FUSE Interrupter. RULE Music tracks. Tracks. She's going to be my girlfriend. My girlfriend. Cristina is going to be my girlfriend. Let's see, García, what chapter did we say we were going to study? - Climate charts? - Capital cities, García! Yes, ma'am. - Don't call me "ma'am!" - Yes, miss. Good morning, we're happy to be here to inform you about the organization of the Little World Cup, at Narciso Mendoza. Do you mind reading them the rules? I don't think that's necessary, sir. They're already posted on the bulletin board. They can read it. What would you rather do, smell Mr. Imenecio's feet, or lick Ms. Yolanda's armpits? Smell Imenecio's feet. That's disgusting! - He likes Imenecio. - I like your mom, you idiot. Don't say that. Here's the sun. There's a house here. Here's a door, and there's snow on the roof. What is it? A house with snow and the sun? No! It's my grandpa bending over to pick up the soap. If you could go anywhere in the world, where would you go? I guess Hawaii. Why Hawaii? I love pineapples. What about you, Malo? Where would you go? Well, I think I'd go to Guadalajara. No way! You could pick any country, any place, and you picked Guadalajara? Why? Guadalajara is my favorite place. My aunt Romina lives there, and I love her very much. Okay. Where would you go? Um... - Italy. - Why? Because everyone's good-looking there. They're hot in Guadalajara too. I bet you anything that no Italian has my aim. Open your mouth. Let's go, Mexico! Time is running out! Time is running out! Let's see how much additional time they get... JUNE And this is the first game for the Mexican team on the World Cup. - They're doing it! - Let's go, Zague, let's go! - You can do it! - Pass it! - Score, score! Yes! - He passed it to him! - They're going to score! - You can do it, let's go! - He missed! - Mom! They tied at the last minute! Dumb Zague! Honey, don't worry, he's going to score soon enough. Why didn't he score, Mom? He almost did, sweetie, didn't you see? He almost did. Damn it! Mom. Mom. - Mom. - What happened, sweetie? What happened? I need your help. With what? Do you have a test? I'm a terrible inventor. Honey, don't say that. It's the truth. Could you help me bake a cake? Now? - It's late, sweetie. - Please. Tomorrow is her birthday. Fine, let's do it. Honey. Sweetie, sweetie. Please, don't get mad at your dad. He thought we made it for him. I'm ruined. - What happened here? Did you shave? - It's nothing, Mom! Sweetie, your dad works a lot... and he's very tired. I know what we can do. I'll give you 10 pesos, go to the bakery and get her something. Okay? Remember, it's the thought that counts. Can I take a look at the geography homework? - What's that? - Nothing. - Let me see. - It's nothing. Are you going to hand me the homework or not? What happened to your face? - Nothing. - Did you shave? Did you shave? You see? That's a private question. Tell me what you have in there. - What? - What you put in your backpack. - A gift. - A gift? For who? For someone special. - When are you going to give it to her? - During recess. - Give it to her now. - I can't. Why? Because right now, sophomores are in music class. - Sophomores? - Yes. Are you sure about this? You can always back out. No, I'm fine. What happened to your face, did you shave? I'm an idiot. Hey. Buddy. How are you feeling? - Oh, God, I'm sorry. - You hit your head. Are you okay? Let me help you. Hey, I'm very sorry. - Come here. - Be careful, Kenji, you hurt him. - I know. - Are you okay? Come, sit over here. - That was a strong blow, Kenji. - I know, Cris. His eyes went backwards even. I said I didn't do it on purpose. I'm really sorry. I... I didn't mean to hit you in the face. We've met before, right? What's your name? José Miguel Mota Palermo. I made this for you. For your birthday. That's nice, thank you. It's a little beaten up, but it's okay. Here, honey. It's hot. - Want some cheese? - Yes! How did it go with the cake? Did she like it? Sweetie? - What did she say about the cake? - And this is Luis Roberto Alves. Liliana is so pretty. What's wrong? I hate you! Leticia. I hate you, Zague, I hate you! Stop hating people, for God's sake! Channel Five. We're your connection. Wow, that's really cool! You like soccer? - Do you? - I love it. Me too. Who do you like? Well... - Mexico. - But what local team? One with the name of an animal. What animal? The Sharks. Cristina, I want to give you something. This is the best rock in the world. If you listen to this cassette, you'll even become a better person. Wow, you're the best. But they don't let me listen to rock in my house. And Kenji is a Christian, he doesn't like it. You'll like it. Let's go to the store. - Right now? - Yes, let's go. - I'll meet you there. - Come. - No, no, I'll meet you there. - Come on, Jos. Nothing worse than an idiot with initiative. He's changed so much. He hasn't been the same in the last two days. Don't mind him. Yeah, don't worry anymore. Besides, Kenji and Cristina are never going to break up. Everyone knows that. What's wrong? Nothing, just... they're all looking at us. So? You didn't care about it before. But now I do care. God sees everything. And what is that? Music. Rock. - Rock? - It's pretty good. Since when do you like rock? If you play it backwards, you can hear evil things. It was a gift. From? Jos, Liliana sent you this. SEE YOU AT 5 AT THE USUAL PLACE You're here early. And you're late. What about Malo? I thought he was coming... - José Miguel. - Yes? Would you like to be my boyfriend? - But I... - What? You're my best friend. I don't know why you like that bimbo. She has a small brain. But that's fine, I'm not going to cry. If you don't like me, that's fine. I like spending time with you. Me too. But... I like Cristina. Look, José Miguel, if you really want to win over Cristina, cake just isn't enough. Really? I'm telling you as a friend. Those girls like tough guys. Guys that play soccer, and those things. Why don't you join the soccer tournament in our school? You could impress her that way. So, we're still friends, like before? - What do you think? - Friends. Jos. What's up? I... I just wanted to tell you that... I don't have a problem with you. We're all brothers. I just don't like that you're getting closer to my girlfriend. Leave his girlfriend alone. She's my friend. You can't forbid me from having friends. Look, don't be a smart-ass. Just stop trying to get close to her, and stop giving her your satanic music. What if she comes to me? Look, just don't be a wise guy, or you're gonna have a hard time, okay? And I could care less who your father is. - I don't care either. - Me neither. Can you tell something personal? Yes. As you may already know, you have a terrible team, José Miguel. You have the worst players in the history of this school. Like Manuel Angulo. Also known as Tarolas. His nickname says it all. Oswaldo García, also known as Thriller. He's very... precocious. But he's a nice kid. Rodolfo Patiño. The Guácala. He ashamed the whole institution during the last Floral Games by reciting his poems in binary code. Zero, one, zero. One, zero, one. One, zero. Zero, one. One, zero, two. I mean, one... zero, one, zero. Zero, one, zero. Wow! That's my son! Miguel Jiménez, nicknamed Motorcito. Known for his... short-distance sprints. And Rodrigo Malo. The worst student that's ever stepped into this school. He's 19 years old, and he's still in freshman year. This is the highest score I've ever gotten in Biology! F Oh, Ro. José Miguel, are you sure you want to do this? We're going to win. Very well, boy, you're registered as a team. Welcome Saudi Arabia. We're going to be this World Cup's surprise. Did you really sign us up for a soccer team? - Can I be the goalie? - Sure. I also want to be the goalie. I get tired fast. - Are we going to play soccer? - Yes, Guácala. We're playing soccer. I promise that if we win, we're going to become popular. Are girls going to show us their legs? Probably, Tarolas, most likely. What do you think, Thriller? If you join, so will Malo. Look, my mom says I can't take these shoes off, and if I do, I'm going to fall. You'll see, you'll be able to play. Your mom doesn't know anything. Hey, wanna play against us? Or are you scared? Fifteen to one! Fifteen to one! We're not going to win if we keep going like this. Those guys are from first grade. And we lost 15 to one? If their mothers hadn't come to pick them up, we would've lost by 16 to one. My mom's going to kill me. Hey, Jos! Jos! Did you join the soccer tournament? Yes, I told you I like soccer. That's great! I'll be cheering for you. I hope you win. - I'll see you later. - Thanks. Let's see, choose. Good morning, good morning. Good morning. Look, Ruíz Palacios, that's for today. Close the door. Quickly. Thanks, Malo, that's nice of you. Very good. What day is today? - Tuesday the 29th. - Thursday. What? Thursday? What comes after Monday? - Tuesday. - So what day is today? Was there any homework today? I don't care. Why didn't you come to training yesterday? Sometimes I can't, José Miguel. This is serious. You wanna be in the team or not? Yes. Okay. What do you have there? - Nothing. - You have a hickey. I got hit with a stone. On your neck? Do you think I'm an idiot? What are you doing, Mota? Go to your seat. We'll talk later. Unit ten, please. What's wrong with you? Stop it already! Stop! What's wrong with you, shortie? You know I hate that you're going after my girlfriend. I haven't kicked your ass only because we're all brothers. Otherwise, you'd have no teeth already. Accept it, Kenji, You're just jealous because Cristina likes me. Because I'm a better soccer player. Laugh all you want. But we're going to make it to finals. And we're going to win. I bet you anything that that will never happen. Oh, no? Whoever wins the final gets to keep Cristina. Bet on it? Okay. But if you lose... stay away from her, forever. - Agreed? - Agreed. Matías, leave that blowgun alone! Mota, what's that? - Good luck, Kenji. - Thanks. Okay then. Good morning, everyone. Today we're going to start the Narciso Mendoza Little World Cup! But before we do, I need to remind everyone that some years ago, I had the opportunity to participate and represent this school in the National Tournament, where, not by luck, we became the champions. And I say it wasn't luck because our team had a lot of talented players. We trained a lot. And, without further ado, I hope a new story can be written today. May the best one win! Good. We're going to play against them? Yes, against them. They don't have a chance, right, Malo? I'll be right back. Let's go to the library. No, miss. Yes, let's go. - Not now. - Come on, let's go. Come on. Penalty, Ramírez. Clear as day, we all saw it. Kenji! Miss, miss miss! Score, score, score! Goal! FINAL SCORE BRAZIL 10- RUSSIA 1 - Are you studying, sweetie? - Yes. What is that, Geometry? I was always terrible at Geometry. I have a team, in school. That's great, sweetie. How are you guys doing? We're not that great. Look, let's see what the commentators have to say. They always say interesting things. - A great score, Nacho. - As I was saying, Raúl, yes, the ball, if it hadn't entered the zone, we wouldn't be celebrating our first goal. That's great... Well, sometimes. We're going to win. We're going to win. We're going to win. We're going to win. We're going to win. We're going to win. We're going to win. We're going to win. We're going to win. We're going to win. We're going to win. We're going to win. NETHERLANDS SAUDI ARABIA Okay, Motor, you're the goalie. You three are defense, and I'll be on offense. - What about me? - You're on the bench. - How come? - Because you missed practice. Nothing personal, but that's not fair for the rest of us. - Okay. - You'll play the second half. We need to concentrate, everyone. Let's win. Please, you need to respect the sport. Would you like me to suspend you? One more and you're suspended, Páramo. Dávila, get out of the field, the game is about to start. Goalie. Goalie. Damn it, Thriller! - Oh, that was with my foot, right? - Form the wall! Dum-Dum, the wall. Oh, García. Here, here. This is fine. Don't move up front. - I'll tell you when. - Where? To the left. Your other left. Umm... yes, yes, yes, there! Thriller, out! Malo, get in here! Goal! Goal! Congratulations, honey! That's right, my babies! All of you! Malo, Malo, Malo! FINAL SCORE SAUDI ARABIA 13- NETHERLANDS 7 Malo... Tell me, what do you see over there? On the other side of the street. - There? - Yes, over there. The motorbikes? No, Malo, make an effort, please. Look beyond that. The high school, sir? That's right. Tell me one thing. Would you like to be on that side of the street one day? Yes, I want to. Then, you need to try harder. But I try very hard, sir. The other day, I studied all night and I got an F. You need a C. A C. - Yes, sir. - A C... Malo, you're a great player. In fact, I'm surprised. Thank you, sir, but I also play with the Toros Neza, and I'm not that good in there. You're in the Toros Neza minor league team? - Yes, sir. - Do you know Mohamed? Yes. Look, I just need you to get a C. In any subject. With your talent, I'll get you accepted in the school over there. Thank you, sir. I told you, they're never going to break up. Everyone knows that. Take one and pass the rest. Take one and pass the rest. Sit down. If you're late for another test, you'll get an F automatically. Test? You won't make it behaving like this. Take one and pass the rest. Ruíz Palacios, shut up, you're another one with no future. Let's see. Shut up, both of you, or I'll kick you out! Ruíz Palacios, get out of the classroom! But it wasn't me! If anyone does it again, you'll fail the exam at once. And I mean it. Ruíz Palacios, get out, now. Silence. You have 87 minutes left. "In what part of a species' evolution do we consider genetic changes significant enough to make it a different species? Describe how a blastocyst forms, and the change it undergoes to become a gastrula during embryonic development." What's a gastrula? Mota! Sir. Can I use the back of the page? No, that's okay. Just write down the number of the question. You suck, Liliana. I warned you, Mota. You better start studying for the make-up exam. You too, Angulo. - But... - Make-up exam! Get out of the room! Damn! Not like that, Malo! You just need to concentrate more. Hey, Liliana? Do you think there's something wrong with me? Of course not. Do this one. It's a lot easier. Yes, yes. I've been looking for you. Liliana, even though we haven't been getting along lately, you're still special to me. You're my best friend. And I brought you this gift. - What is it? - Can you hand me a cassette? Oh, it ran out of battery. But it's a cassette rewinder. It's great. Thank you. Can I ask you something? Yes. Is it true that Kenji and you made a bet so that whoever wins the final gets Cristina? It was Kenji's idea. But don't tell anyone. SEMIFINAL BRAZIL - SPAIN Brazil, Brazil, Brazil! Kenji, you're the best! Let's go, Kenji! A goal, we want a goal! A goal, we want a goal! A goal, we want a goal! Do you think Kenji's team will make it to the finals? I don't know, but I like that Astroboy. Have you seen those legs? Well... Do you know what will happen if Kenji's team and José's team go to the finals? They'll play against each other, duh! - Promise not to tell anyone if I tell you? - Yes. But she's going to tell everyone. - Yes, but we're friends. - So? Promise me you won't tell anyone. It's something bad. - Fine. - Okay. Kenji and José Miguel have a bet. Whoever wins the tournament gets to keep Cristina. Oh, that bet. We all knew about it. Guácala told Tacita. Tacita told me, and I told Carmina. Carmina told Jeff, Jeff told Bolabola, and everyone knows now. SCOREBOARD BRAZIL 6- SPAIN 3 José Miguel, I've been thinking about it, and I don't like this bet. It's wrong to bet on a person. God wouldn't like it. I'll get Cristina. We'll have two kids. One boy and one girl. - You're crazy... - You both are a piece of crap. You can bet all you want, but I'm not staying with either of you. - No, Cris. - You two are the worst. - No, Cris, no. - We're through. See? I told you. Women aren't anyone's property. What? I can't believe this. - You'll regret this. - No I won't, and our bet is still on. Cris! Cris! Hi. I'm sorry. Cristina, I just wanted to defend you. Thanks, Jos, but I don't need anyone to defend me. Good morning. Morning. Go to your seats. And get your things ready, we have an exercise coming up. Gatica, stop eating your own boogers, please. - Why did you tell everyone? - What are you talking about? Oh, please! You told everyone about the bet. No, I didn't, Jos. What's wrong with you? I thought we were friends. - I thought so too... - Mota, what are you doing? - Nothing. - Get back to work then. Yes. Okay, let's begin. Last week, we were talking about potassium nitrate. Potassium nitrate has a structure... We're through, you're not my best friend anymore. Whatever, I don't care. In a system, at 264.2° Farenheit. We'll win the final match, and Cristina will be my girlfriend. Kenji and Cristina are never breaking up. Everyone knows that. SEMIFINAL SAUDI ARABIA - ITALY Watch out! Mota! Mota! What was that? Get out. - Didn't you see what he did? - I don't care. Out, or your team is out. Timeout! Mr. Rodríguez! - That's awful. - A word, please. What happened? You can't interrupt the game like that. I think that red card was too much. Imenecio, you saw it yourself. He came in too hard. We can't allow that here. They can't do that, they can't ask for more time. I know. What's going on? - I don't know. - Mota! I'll let you play. But you can't do that again! That's wrong. You can't play like that. - Are we clear? - Yes. We're going to apply rule 43 from the official FIFA rules. It won't be a red card, but a yellow. We're taking it back. - You can't do that! - Let's play. - You can't do that! - Let's play. - You can't do that! - Yellow card for you too! Whoever keeps at it will get kicked out of the game! Calm down, shut up and play! Go on. Goal! FINAL SCORE SAUDI ARABIA 9- ITALY 7 - Saudi Arabia! - That's ridiculous. Congratulations, boys, you made it to the final. Good job, Malo, we're doing great. Let's go to my house and plan our strategy for tomorrow. I can't, José Miguel. I need to study, I have to get a C. I'll help you. I can't, I have to go to Miss Yolanda's house for tutoring. I can teach you anything even better than her. She's not that smart. Don't say that, Miss Yolanda is nice. Malo, best friends are there for you when you need them most. And you're my best friend. - Really, José Miguel? - Really. Okay, I'll go to your house after six. Great! We'll get a pizza. - Yes, yes. Can it be pepperoni? - Sure thing. Of course, Italy was completely out of place. Mexico dominated the second part of the game, completely. And remember Bernal's shot? He made it without Zague's help. He stayed behind. José Miguel! What? You have a phone call! I'm not home! José Miguel, phone call! Since Spain in 1982, there hasn't been a team that could come back from this... What's up? Miss? I'll let you two talk. See you soon, Rodrigo. - Yes. - See you tomorrow, Mota. And don't forget your homework. Why is our teacher here? Because I hurt... my pubis. - The what? - Pubis. Your pelvis? That. I won't be able to play tomorrow. - Is that a joke? - No, I'm serious. The doctor said I won't be able to play for months. It wasn't my fault, José Miguel, I swear. Jeez. I'm in the hospital, José Miguel. You're bloody selfish, Rodrigo. But you said that friends are there for when you need them most. Exactly, and you're only thinking about yourself. - Excuse me, young men. - Sorry. I can't, José Miguel. I can't believe you're doing this to me. Young man, let your friend rest. Come on, let's go. I can't believe you're so selfish. - Tomorrow is the soccer final! - Be quiet, this is a hospital, you can't yell in here. It's been proven time and again that Mexico... We're not huge stars, but we have a great team under the direction of Mejía Barón. Excuse me, honey. Would you like some quesadillas? No. - You sure? - Yes. I'm making some cupcakes for your sister. You want some too? I can make bacon too, if you want. ...it ends with a headbutt by Zague and the ball straight to the post. Straight to the post, Lalo! As if it was magnetized towards it. The post pulls to it, and the ball doesn't go to the net. That's right, it doesn't at all. Hey, honey. Your dad and I want to talk to you. I'm a genius. CHAMPIONSHIP Malo is not here, you'll have to forgive Kenji. I don't know if I can. Malo isn't coming? Forget about him. You're playing instead, Thriller. You'll play defense. - What about Rodrigo? - Jeez. Don't worry about it, I have it all under control. We're going to win this final! Yes. CHAMPIONSHIP BRAZIL - SAUDI ARABIA Ruíz Palacios, where's Malo? They said he hurt his pubis. Pubis? I dunno. That's what they said. Captains, the balls, please. Let's see. What the hell is this? This is worthless. This one's good, your pick, Kenji. - Kickoff. - Go ahead. Why isn't your star player here? Because he's selfish. Look, José Miguel... you'll see I'm a good guy. Let him. Go first. It went out! Come on, it's not going that bad. We need to tire them out. - Are you serious? - We're done, right? We made it to the finals, what more do you want? My knees are bleeding. I'm not even allowed to play soccer. I could care less. I only like it when girls play and they're wearing those little shorts. I don't like soccer either. But Cristina Palazuelos likes it. If we win this game, I'm going to have two kids with her. A boy and a girl. What if they come out wrong? Look, if we win, there's a big chance that each one of you, after this game, will all get a girlfriend. - Are you serious, José Miguel? - I promise. We all have different abilities. We just have to use them. Thriller, come here. What do you want? Take those shoes off. I told you, I can't. My mom won't let me, she says I'll fall without them. Your mom is a liar. Thriller, look at me. You can do this. Repeat after me. You can do this. You can do this. Mom! You're a cheater! You cheated! Cheater? Are you crazy, or what? Look at the score. - Say you're sorry. - I'm not going to. Hey, hey. Everyone to their classrooms, now. The game is over, everyone, to your classes. I'll be waiting for you once school is over. - I've had enough of you. - Kenji, to your classroom. CHAMPIONSHIP BRAZIL 18- SAUDI ARABIA 1 See you after school. They call him Kenji Karate Kid. See you after school. They call him Kenji Karate Kid. I'm going to kill you. José Miguel. José Miguel! I know you're stupid, but you can't be stupid enough to go fight Kenji. You don't get it. I'm a man of my word. You're going to be left with nothing after you fight him. - I know how to fight. What do you know? - I know he's a brown belt, and that he broke a block of ice with one hit. - Silence! - Please! He can't be a brown belt. I'm serious, dude. Don't do it. You already lost the soccer match. What's left? - They cheated. - That's not true. I gave him my word, and I'm going to keep it. Since we have two minutes left, who wants to come up here and show us their knowledge? Mota. Damn! Good luck, bud. He's so little. Poor thing. He's going to fight? José Miguel, here we are. Damn son of a bitch. Jos, don't do this. I have to defend your honor, Cristina. Are you serious? Fight, fight, fight! Fight, fight, fight! Kenji, if you touch him, I'll never talk to you again. He's just a kid. Look... It doesn't have to be this way, okay? We can still stop this. Are face punches okay? Are you okay? But you're a freshman. Love has no age, Cristina. People don't know what rock really is. Is Scorpions rock? U2 isn't either. What where they thinking? How can that be rock? And The Caifanes are the Mexican Cure, right? I mean, I shouldn't compare, but yes, that cassette changed my life. Yes. My cousin also gave me an incredible cassette. You need to hear it, Jos. Plaza Inn is the best, right? There's a skateboard store downstairs. Let's go. - José Miguel. - Yes? Are you okay? We've been together for about two weeks, and I've noticed you're acting strange. What's wrong? Jos, you know you can always tell me the truth. No matter what it may be. - Really? - I swear. I think I really like Liliana. But don't get mad... You're an idiot! Sit down, ma'am. Thanks, boy, you're too kind. From now on, I'm doing things properly. Oh, dude. What's up, bro? How are you? What are you doing here? Liliana. Do you want to be my girlfriend? Of course not, José Miguel. Wow, this dude is something else, seriously. Goes alone towards the penalty. García Aspe and the referee, in front of Mihaylov. The referee leaves them alone... He missed! Alberto García Aspe! Alberto García Aspe missed. Again on the damn penalties. Lalo, it must be a mindset problem. It's what I found. But it has both AM and FM. Are you okay? I'm sorry about what happened. How do you know about that? Everyone knows. Your sister hasn't stopped crying. She's been locked in the bathroom for hours. My sister? Yes, she ripped off all the Zague posters from her room. It's sad. What does Zague have to do with this? What do you mean, what? We lost during penalties against Bulgaria. Oh! Your mom and I need to talk to you. We're moving next week. What? Again? But we're going to a beautiful place. It's close to the beach. You're going to love it. You're going to have time to say goodbye to your friends, and... - get some closure. - Closure? You guys know nothing about love or friendship, Dad. Mota. I know that what happened today was unfair. But you played well. You showed courage. To me, you're the champion of this tournament. Look, this is your dad and me. Always together. I want you to give it to him. This was the year before we became champions. Without your father, we wouldn't have won a single game. Can you do me a favor? Tell him I miss him, okay? Malo, come with me. I have good news for you. If we organize a lunch with Mohamed, you could... Malo! Come! It's amazing. - A cousin of mine gave it to me. - What? A cousin gave it to me. He heard it at camp. - Pearl Jam? - Yes. Look who's coming. I loved you both, a lot. I wanted to give you something. This is the best rock music in the world. If you listen to this, you'll become a better person. But now we have to wait another four years, and dream of France 98'. We should thank our fans, of course, for all their support... Are we there yet? Almost, honey. And Dad? He'll be here next week. - Guess what he said? - What? That the house has a pool! That's awesome! Hey, Mom? Yes, honey? - Done? - No. I think maybe I want to poop. No, honey. We're almost there. Just wait a little bit. Okay, I'll wait. Careful, honey. José Miguel! Don't take long! We're almost there, honey, wait! IMENECIO NEVER SAW JOSÉ MIGUEL'S DAD AGAIN.

Are we done? - Which one would you pick? - The Z24. You don't know. Give me another ten. I mean, I could drive it without documents. A cousin of mine did that. I mean, he's in jail, but for different reasons. I think I could... Subtitle translation by Carolina Salazar
