Yeah, yeah Water! Fresh water! Fish! Fresh fish directly from the sea! Fresh vegetables! Just look how many healers, quacks, shamans and all sorts of wizards came to cure the poor princess Zubejda He's coming - Sultan Soliman! Our leader, our brightest sun! Our leader, our brightest sun! Our leader, our brightest sun! Me? Look, I brought something for you Thanks! One, two... Go away, stinky! You will only poison her! Just look at her, Mr. Lustig She's getting weaker, more pale and skinny And she's supposed to get married One colleague sultan wants her Rich one - he has six wives! But if she looks pale like that, I doubt he will still want her That's bad Czech bijouterie made her happy every time And where does it hurt, princess? Nowhere, that's the thing She doesn't even go for walks And I bought her whole set of walks! Zubejda, little daughter... Where do you want to go today? To the park or the market place? So we will go to the market place The market place, that's... that's number 7 Fish! Fish! Fish! Sea fish! Buy fresh sea creatures! Catch that dog! He's running away with my sausage! Rounded melons, bent bananas Don't believe, I ate them and I'm still green No melons! Buy fish! If I may, Sultan Soliman... Our leader, our brightest sun! She's sorrowful We know that! Shut up, nanny Rather make sure she eats For that, you should call for true, genuine and graduate doctor from our country No way some quacks and sharlatans And how do you recognize true, genuine and graduate doctor? You recognize him by the name starting with Dr. For example Dr. Neumann Or Dr. Belnár And when he doesn't have Dr., that means he is not a doctor! Hasn't got Dr. - not a doctor, has got Dr. - is a doctor I would rather write it for you because you use the scribbles of yours That's it that's how we write it Be careful not to erase it, stupid! I prefer to punish them in advance because after there would be no use And one more thing If the doctor wanted to bring his sister nurse he should! Because, a sister nurse is the doctor's right hand! Wouldn't it be better Mr. Lustig, if you went with them? Well... I could So we are sure they bring the right man for the job Did you understand? Take those two and one camel, so Mr. Lustig doesn't have to walk And now, I would like to buy some trinkets for my wives More wives, more worries You give something to one, another wants it too You surely know? I don't... The boy has just somehow overgrown I see, I see And why didn't you bring him sooner? There was no time Too much work Can you read and write, son? What is this? Little house The boy isn't dumb I also think it's like a shack You are also illetarate? Mr. ? Lotrando is my name Also, my good man, also. But I wasn't But now, especially in the morning I'm totally illetarate I can't straighten my back Well, it's the age... Mr. mayor Call me Father Prior, Mr. Lotrando Yeah, yeah So we are clear, daddy Prior I don't want my son to be a Bible beater I mean a vicar, if you understand me? I understand You want to give the boy a secular knowledge That's possible, but... Rather costly Only the well adjusted can afford that We could teach the boy French Merci And German Danke schön And here is some mix So much money Where did you get that? My good man? Where I could, daddy Prior Where I could Don't worry about the boy! When he leaves our convict, you won't recognize him! And what does he do, your good father, my dear son? Well I don't know In the morning he goes to the valley and in the evening he brings back gold So he must be a gold digger Your father's business is therefore a gold mine Yeah, I guess And what about your dear mother, taking care of the household I presume? I have only step-mommy Your mother passed away?

And in the meantime in the Czech valley the son of the bandit was becoming an educated young man But pay attention! The world is small and full of coincidences You are red as a red man, sir Are you an Indian? Red man - on a tree! Indian - on a tree! What's that? Wait, son, I will help you Cut it, son! I thank you sincerely, young man You are welcome My name is Lustig Nice to meet you And I travel with bijouterie Home residence: Jablonec But I'm traveling all the time Shame Thank you, boys I thought you were an Indian Unfortunately Can't be of service But you haven't seen a foreign expedition here, have you? With a camel? Nah We were ambushed! But we gave that old bandit hell! I made him run so far! But my legs are not as quick as they used to be I didn't manage to escape Why is she so sad? Well, she is missing something, young man And so, whenever, brothers, you see someone on a branch behave the same way as our clever Lotrando Cut without hesitation And now I kindly ask Mr. Lustig to tell us something about bijouterie Sure Bijouterie from Jablonec Or like we of the profession call it shortly - bijou has a great name in the world We don't hide it's an imitation We admit it! with its affordable price Wonderful work Right? For example here However, the thieves didn't understand that They said "It's a fake!" "You wanted to cheat us!" "You will hang!" I said "Her Gott, Sacra, guys..." I said... "Crucifix, guys?" "Crucisand, guys?" Only "sand", Mr. Lustig Only "sand" I said "Sand!" "Guys!" "You have never heard about our famous bijouterie?" And their capo That thug! Some Lotrando! What a coincidence! My young savior has the same name as the old scoundrel Just the same name, Mr. Lustig Just the same name The father of this boy is a gold mine owner Well The world is small and full of coincidence So that bastard May I? The bastard said "Himmel Her Gott! Hang him by the legs" "Himmel Laudon?" And he said "Laudon, hang him by the legs" "On the tree!" Her Gott, It's so hard to lecture here Are they coming yet? They're not! Don't lie to me! I swear they are not coming! And are you looking? I am! So look properly! I'm looking properly! Lotrando is leaving! Where is he? There he is! It's about damn time! I hope we can make it! Farewell, my son Dad is barely hanging there Vincek! You lazy dog! Do you bring my god damn boy? You bet I am! But I don't know if you understand him He talks like a mix of a Bible beater and a parrot My dear father I wish the allmighty God will cherish you for long years for the joy of your near ones and the unspeakable offspring Slow down, boy! Slow down I'm riding to hell and I have no time for your sweet nonsense Listen carefully I wanted to leave bags of gold for you so you could live without any effort But bloody hell, boy there were such hard times for our profession Dear father, I was unaware that you are in such a grave need Well, yeah Everyone left me Like rats It's a high time for you to take over my boy Dear father If you wish that I will take over your profession And I will do it honestly willingly and kindly to everyone I don't know how you will do with kindness in our job And may I ask, my dear father? What is your honest profession? Robbery You see? Stick with that Robbery? Well yeah Mainly, my boy Never work Yes Yes, daddy dear In that moment, the bandit's sinful soul started to head for the Heaven But because it was too heavy from all the terrible sins It had to go elsewhere And we know where So Lotrando was left in the world alone Devastated by both the death of his father and also the ill-considered promise that he will take over his job and becomes a bandit PLUM LIQUOR Vizovice Top of the morning to you I hope I'm not disturbing you My God, not in the slightest And what can I do for you? My good man? I ask you with all my heart not to be scared, sir So you understand, I am a terrible bandit Lotrando Bollocks! Yes please I don't take any joy in this but I promised to my father in his last hour So I have to I'll be damned, so the old Lotrando is dead? The guys in the pub in Vizovice will be so pleased to hear that! So will you give me everything willingly? It would be better for both of us I won't I see Stab! In that case, I have to stab you I ask you to prepare and pray Go on! Here Now? Yes Angel, my guardian, take care of my soul... Don't fool around, he's delaying on purpose! Stab him! Live human? To stab? It would surely hurt him Good gracious... Dad is watching from above, young sir or from below? In any case, he sees everything! Well, mister, are you properly confessed? No way, I am a terrible sinner But I thought of something If I could go to Kostelec for confession The Lord would hopefully forgive me You know what, sir, I will now go guickly to Kostelec Confess And when I return you can go ahead and stab me Good thought Right? I will wait here next to your carriage I see your horse there If you could lend it to me please So I can be back faster You are right, it will be faster Exactly Go ahead It's a nice horse I guess it will be windy on him If you could lend me the jacket? Here you go The nice hat also They said all kinds of filth are going through these woods so if you could lend me the gun and this one too! You know, so I can keep my word We have to get lost We will bring this and go away Wait a second, Vincek The same way I promised my father that I will take over his job I promised the merchant right now that I will wait for him Here Promise is a promise Old Lotrando is dead and next to the oak young one is robbing Come on! Let's go! Quickly! Young sir, let's get wasted at least We won't get, we will be wasted Not yet! You will have to wait longer Such a happy birthday today Oh, I wish you all the best, young sir Health is most important And how old are you exactly? I'm not underage anymore Well, in that case, two weights were lifted from my heart Your mom, I mean, Mrs. Madla Before your father sold her to slavery because he was really bankrupt She said when saying goodbye: When Lotrando comes of age give him this So he has a memory of me So I'm giving to you So she hasn't died, my dear mommy he sold her to slavery, my dear daddy How was she? Tell me about her Well, Mrs. Madla She was a kind soul She was so young and caring Not so good for your father All the time, she told him to stop with the robbing and starts with a decent work Well, so now the second weight from my heart I promised the old man that I would assist you before you come of age So that job is finished for me, young sir But... Don't hold it against me, but you are not very clumsy for this job Spoiled by all schools that it will be best If I continue on my own Go and have no regrets, Vincek Under the oak, behind the oak We will be waiting for you Under the oak, over the oak Money or your life! What's that? Well... Money or your life I'm a terrible bandit Lotrando I see Well, damn, I don't have money So I can only give my life Your life you say? That's right Or...

We do that here on this place And who is this man? That's our executioner Hello, Hasan! Hiya! Hiya! Hálí, Hálí My God, the two of us should cure her? Yeah... That's why you are here Hálí, my friend, what are you saying? For healing there are doctors Doctors He's a doctor He has Dr. before his name Good heavens, what kind of doctor am I? Hálí I'm an ordinary dry wood cutter! Dr. Ywoodcutter Or Dr. Nec We don't care But not Dr. Ywoodcutter but dry wood cutter He's a lumberjack! What's that?

But some very poor prince You told me that in your country every man likes only one woman Only one And they are from your country? Yes, they are from ours From Makotřasy And could we somehow save their lives? If they don't cure you, they can't be helped Doctors are not here? They aren't And where are they? Why they don't heal? Fellow countrymen! Fellow countrymen I brought you someone What are you doing here, Mr. Lustig? Well, the world is small and full of coincidence Mr. Lustig This is Mr. Drnec Nice to meet you But you got yourselves into a serious situation I have some influence on the sultan but concerning Zubejda, he has no mercy Where are your doctors, Hálí? Why they don't heal? Doctors They are, sultan Soliman our leader... Make it short They are down and mix all kinds of creams and healing potions Also. And they don't like our sun Our gold one So they need to be in the cold And when is the execution? Tomorrow already Already? Time just went by Princess is missing three ordinary things the nanny said Three things I thought that we will show them how can we work They have it overgrown For shame! In such a house there is lot of moisture Fungus, mould and earwigs! And where the sun doesn't shine, a doctor has to go Wait a second... I just thought of something What if we...? You're thinking totally? What did he say? What if you...? But this time we do it properly, no fooling around Hálí is a cigar person We now give yo your final wish Short walk and then quickly to the execution And Drnec, why do you bring all these things? Why? So noone steals them Drnec, I didn't sleep the whole night You will lose your heads! But if not you, then us! I prefer all the heads on the necks Well, me too!
