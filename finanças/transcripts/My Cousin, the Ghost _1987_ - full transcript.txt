--== McEphie ==-- Morning -Morning. Lovely day -Yes. Come to feed the pigeons -Yes. Where have all the pigeons gone. There aren't so many. We'll count then. One, two, three. They keep moving, they won't stay still. Well, count them again. All right. One, two, three, four, five, six. One, two, three, four, five, six. All they've gone. Bye-Bye -Bye. Cousin. What are you doing? Put it down. Why are you acting sneakily? I nearly chopped you by mistake. You always wanted to chop me. You always threaten to chop for nothing. Don't you know you've no ID card? Without me, you'd have been expelled back to HK. And your shop would've closed down. Kill this pigeon first. There are some left from yesterday's batch. Keep today's and kill yesterday's, idiot I'll be off tomorrow -Why? Come early tomorrow. I have an engagement. Where are you going tomorrow? Wei's wife wants to introduce me to girl. What? Dating a Greek girl for marriage? Only to be friends. It's okay, but you must think twice I've already thought it over. Since you fail to get me PR status. Marrying a Greek girl is the only resort. It's better than imprisonment. Hey, are those 2 dishes ready? Would he take them raw? Hurry up. The customer's getting impatient. - Is our food ready? - I am coming. Very Sorry, just a minute, please. Alright then. You've cooked the pigeon for almost an hour. Why didn't you cook the vegetables till now? And the 5 sweet and sour soups? I know you were lazy. So many shreds, what a waste! I only have two hands. And a pair of feet too. It's most important to be alert. Stop nagging. Quit and see if you can find work. You can't speak or understand English. Don't be arrogant. Me, arrogant? I'm on your side I've provided for you all those years. How are you going to square the deal? Anything you say. You're threatening to chop. Without me you'd have slept in the streets. You bastard, I'll chop you to death. Don't try anything foolish. At worst I'll quit. You've no ID card, you're an illegal. An illegal immigrant, to be exact. Inform against me then. - Who is the illegal immigrant? - He I'm an immigration Officer, you'd better come with us. Aren't you happy now? I didn't do it purposely. This is the final call for British. Airway Flight 03 to Hongkong. Mako, Mako. I didn't know he's an immigration Officer I'm sorry. Your pay so far amounted to $8,300 but after deductions, you only have this. Take it. The food on the plane is bad I've specially brought this for you. I know you don't have a good appetite. Wear more on board for it's air-conditioned. Take care. Time's up, we have to go. You'll regret all your life. Please help yourself. Which of you eat my pig? Who'd have eaten the pig? This is cousin's girlfriend. Fat Maid, Pao, come here. Did you see that bride? No. - The old one? - No. - What are you doing? - Go and see for yourself. Cheers, cheers. - Doesn't she look like cousin's girlfriend. - She really is. Why throw a party over this? Keep it from cousin. He can't stand the shock. It would be horrible if he knew his girl friend's marrying someone else. Damn, I'll beat you to a frazzle I'll beat your bloody hands and your bloody feet. Damn, I'll beat... Mako, are you still angry with me? We're cousins after all I'll beat your bloody feet. What? Who has no shoes on? I... I don't I'll kill you, damn cockroaches. Cockroaches? There have been cockroaches and rats. What superstitious things you're doing? You and your cousins are hopeless. Luckily, your ancestor has left you a house. Had I not hired you you might have become street sleepers. What's there to see? Back to work. Uncle Mako. Do you want to get paid? Yes, but I don't know how to put it. Come to the point. What's it? I'm afraid you can't stand that. Stop kidding. Speak up. Your girlfriend's marrying someone else. Uncle Mako, are you all right? I'm okay. He really is open-minded. Look, he's crying sadly. Of course. You can find other girls. Few people know what happened. Resign yourself to fate. They enjoy life; You work like hell. Work hard if you envy them. Cousin. Well, are the vegetables done or not? Calm down. - Who takes care of the host's table? - I do. Serve them well. Okay. Yours, yours... Cousin Yung, your vegetable's poisoned. Don't serve it to the guests. Is this the only dish poisoned? Don't just stand by and wait for death I'm not the one to die. What now? Please help yourselves, everybody. How can we eat like that? It's wiped off now. Go and change at once. YES, SIR You may get killed eating it. Try. Are you the host's family? Take it. Yours, yours... Hey, come here. Let's discuss it I can't sneeze anymore. Let's take turns. What happened? Cousin is using poison -Poison? Why stand there? Bring the dishes. Okay, right away. Bad, mixed up. Which dish? Go now. Watch out. Which one's poisoned? Be careful -Be careful. Please help yourselves, everybody. Cheers, cheers. Watch out for flies. Please help yourselves. I won't trouble you. Yours... Sorry, time to serve wine. What now? Fixed? Yes. What are we going to do next? The Manager's over there. Manger... What are you up to? We didn't do it purposely. Mr Chiang wants you to see him, sir. Mr Chiang, sorry, just now... No way. You've made me lose face I'll tell them to say sorry. Jaws is ready to bite. Serve now. Cousin Yung, I have no way out. There are still stuffed crabs, chicken, fish. Chow fan, red bean paste, etc. Outrageous. You can never find word elsewhere. I don't want to see people killed here. What? The food is poisoned. Shut up. You've spoiled the atmosphere. Cousin, no more nonsense. Had you not poisoned it... What? Had we not stopped them from eating they'd have all died. You think I wanted to poison them? I saw you hiding the rat poison. Cousin, there's no point in... Get away. What? Cousin. Cousin, don't I won't do anything bad because of her. Someone's getting me off the hook. People surely choose better things. Good, I'll toast you both. Cousin. Or you prefer humiliation? What... what do you want? Cheers. You... Mako. Nonsense. Dial 999. Well, it's now another day. I'll turn over a new leaf and forget her. While on the subject, I must do something. Where are you going? Fling away anything that tramp gave cousin. Tell him to go to bed early. Cousin, take it easy. Don't be sad. He won't, he's a he-man. Look, how happy he is. Why is the drinking so much? Not everyone drinks because he's heart-broken I drink because I'm excited. - I'm really excited. - Go... go now. Go up to sleep. You must work after waking up. Morning -Morning. Wait for me at the junction. Why? Let me help you pack. Hush -Why? I'll pack it myself I'll wait for you here. Switch it off. Sit down. Don't wake them up. Only we two are going. If they know, they'll blame me for putting women ahead of friendship. Though I may do it because of you I won't do it openly. They'll be sad if they know. But between love and friendship I'd rather give up love I must maintain this friendship. That's all I want to tell you now I can leave now. What? You dated me for barbecue? What's this cue you're talking about? I only heard about stage cue, billiard cue. But never barbecue! Are you going or not? This must be something dangerous. I'm not going. Well, don't see me anymore. I won't care about you even if you come back. Good, all girls are gone. Good I'll give her hell if she comes back. Don't ever come back. Oh, a man. Of course. Take it, maniac. - What now? - It's for you. Tear it off if it comes from her. So soon? Impossible. Who is it from? Cousin Big. What? Nothing special. He's winding up the business there and bringing his money back to HK. Never. When I was in England, I faced the kitchen in the day, the pillow at night I made something out of sweat. But I offended him unknowingly. He exposed my status as an illegal immigrant and I was expelled by the British Govt. Cousin, forget it. Forget the past I must take vengeance. We're cousins there's no enmity between us. And he brought money to go into business. As employees, we've to ingratiate ourselves. We mustn't spoil this golden opportunity. What does that mean? Cousin Big's coming to live with us. Good, good I'd never let him live with me. Come out, all of you. What are you doing? Playing smart. It's serious -What is it. Where'd Cousin Big sleep. We've already leased his room to someone. Cousin will sleep with Cousin Big. You're headless. They're enemies. You can't let them sleep together I have an idea -Yes. That beautician has been away for one week. Cousin Big may take her room for the time being. What if she returns. There won't be such a coincidence. Since it's empty, let's make use of it. - Why is it so dark. - The light's not on I know. Switch it on. No need to clean it, it's tidy. What a beautiful photo. Stop dreaming. You may get bad dreams. Sorry for the shabby condition. Cousin, do we have to clean it. How strange! She hasn't been here for long. Cousin, what a puff of chilly wind. Nonsense. Fat Maid, close it. Frankly, did you open the door I did it myself, I think. Hey, the door... Just close it. It has never been opened. Where did the wind come from. Q, where are you going. To sleep. Sleep? Did you... What? You always said I snored loudly. Did you come here to sleep? Must be you -Don't deny. Tell us. Right. Tell us -Don't deny. Yes, It's all right. It's okay -Go to sleep. Who's coming back. What a pretty boy. Thank God. If I appear now, I may scare them. Bastards, don't scare yourselves. What happened? That doorbell is ringing. When did you change it last. A long time ago. You told me to do it. Replace it, or I'll beat you up. Open up. Open up. This door is not mine -Open up. Who are you looking for. Let me ask you first. Who is it. You all know her. Are you back I'm getting old, I even forgot my key. It's been a long time. Do I look old? Show some respect for an elder. Are you surprised by my return. Don't you welcome my return. No. What? Are you throwing me out. No, we thought you weren't coming back. So we've reserved it for cousin I've already paid you six months' advance rent. Go now. Go now. You've been away so long. We thought... Don't curse me. I'll return even if I died. We'll pay you back the rents. Move out. If I'm not mistaken, you must be Yung. Yes. Since when have you learnt this. You never acted like this before. What have I done wrong. Nothing -Yes, you often drank our wine. Try this. Is this the Water Authority's water or your brothers' wine? Try. Don't scare her. Tell her this is wine. No, it's water. Are you framing her. Framing me. Miss Wang, only a misunderstanding. We only hope you'll stay away for a while and he wants to stay here. So we hope you'll do us a favor by moving out. You must be out of your mind. Miss Wang, you've been out for so long. Just stay for two more months. No, I've just returned from down below. Where can I sleep, if not here. Put up with a friend for the time being. Things are different now, I've changed work I'm now a beautician at a Funeral Parlor. Why have you chosen such work? What's wrong with the job. Don't touch my face. Afraid -Stop that. If I get married. I'll move out. See who's going to help us. Me again. What can we do. I have an idea -What is it. Wait till Cousin Big is back. Don't try to scare me. Don't play a man to scare a ghost. A ghost scares men, not ghosts. Haven't you found a master to get enshrined. A bridesmaid can't take the bride's place. You can own the house, but not the man. What do you want then. What do you want. Don't try anything foolish I won't. I'll find a good one. Don't hurt me. What about you I'll find someone who's dying I've already waited a long time. Don't worry. You go your way, I go mine. Any of us without a master shall return to the Temple. Where are you going -Go in. You'd better get out of here. Calm down. Why fight between us. Impossible, he said he'd return today. Would he back out at the last minute? I've put all my hopes to him. Go now. Come again tomorrow. Go home empty-handed. HELLO He's coming back at last. Is he still angry with me. Are you going to open or not. Are you going to push the button. A gentleman must right the wrongs. A gentleman should forget an old score I'll open it I'll push the button. Cousin -Cousin. Coming back. Yes. Come in, I'll help you. Could he be up to something? You must be tired after over 10 hours flight. My fatigue's gone on reaching home I'll bring you a towel. No need, cousin I always take orders from you. The kitchen's just like my former restaurant I got a drug to eliminate them all. Get rid of them now while hot. Cousin... Idiot, forget the past I've boiled sesame paste. Come on, eat. Don't worry, my hands are clean. You'd be finished if I put some poison in it I know. Cousin, are you going to eat. Let me go in to see those glutinous rice dumplings. I'm excited today. Towel. It's hot. I'll eat when it cools down. I can eat faster then. But not too cold. Remember when I worked up to midnight I ate those cold remnants and got sick. Forget that. I'll bring you dumplings saw a doctor the next day and you deducted my wages 3.6, but I'll forget it now. In fact, I had no wages. You've finished so soon. Yes, it's delicious I know I did you an injustice. No, it was only my fault. Eat. I'm used to eating remnants. Cousin, they look delicious. Bring more. Okay. One must play safe. What? I chipped the chopping board. You've a jolly good appetite. They're delicious. Want any more. No, no. Sit over there. There's a long sofa. Okay -Come on, come here. Come on. What are you doing. It's sweltering. Let in the air. Cousin, sit over there. What is it. They're still not coming back. They won't return so early. There may be power failure. Take care. Help, help! Keep away. What are you doing? I know I did you an injustice. Chop me. What? I'd have done it in. England had I wanted to I'm now chopping myself I'm chopping it open to show my intestines. Don't! Don't! I'll let you chop me. You hate my guts. Come on. Chop my neck, chop my neck. Chop my head. Come on. Open up. Why such a noise? Try to get in. Go in through the window. Open up. Break the window. Keep away. Help, help! What is it? What happened? What happened, Cousin Big? Cousin was getting out of his mind. He's been trying to chop me. You won't believe it. You brought such a mess on return. Go up. Let's talk it over. Put it down. What a mess after my return I won't be happy if I stay. Right, we're friends, we should live together. Let's join forces to build a brilliant future. No problem. Let's share prosperity and adversity. He told me to chop him. He's often out of his mind. You were at variance before but the enmity can easily be erased I guarantee this won't happen again. - But... - Cousin said you're a good wine blender. Blend a few glasses. - Did he really say that? - Yes. Okay. Sit here -What is it. Cousin, he also has a share in this house. Aren't you taking him for a relative. Had he ever taken me for his relative. Cousin, just to me a favor, will you. No. - Cousin... - Speak no more. Okay. We lost our jobs because of you. Now he's given us a chance I'd rather beg than ask him a favor. I don't want to embarrass Cousin Big. Am I right. Yes, let the room to Cousin Big. This is better. My pulse is boiling. This is another man's wife. Another man's wife. One casual drink is okay. Drinking it always can bring you bust. And this. No more. You tried too hard! Now you're all wet. You don't get tough with girls or you'll get wet. What are you two doing? He's teaching me how to drink. Where's cousin -Lie down. Lie down, feigning sleep. - He's fallen asleep. - It's okay then. He even wanted to say sorry to you. As I said, there's nothing between you. He only wanted to kill you. You're drunk; I forgive you. It's nice you're all here I've just wound up the business in U.K. and got 476,830 out of it I'll remit it to HK next week. We're rich. Quiet, we're still planning. As to the disposal of the capital... You make the decision, Cousin Big. Let's not divide it then. We must consult everybody I won't forget your share. But if I know any of you is frivolous, spendthrift and cares not about his future or resorts to illegal activities, I'll cut off his source of income to show him that a family business is hard to build up. Right, we must observe family traditions. Who are you? Why are you here naked? Who are you? What is it? Cousin Big, why are you in the wrong room? In underpants. Right -Do you wear much? What are you doing here, lousy men? To sleep. Cousin Big, you don't sleep here. Did I enter the wrong room? Yes, luckily I wasn't asleep. Impossible, I saw a picture stuck here. You must've stuck it yourself. Sorry for the interruption. Thank you -Don't mention it. Go back to sleep. What's up? What happened. It's okay, Go in. Cousin Big, let me make the introduction. No need -I must... Sit down. What are you doing. Well, cousin... Tell him, Q. Fat maid, tell him. Me? He's my cousin. My last name is Wu. Let's sleep. Please enlighten me. Do you mean it. Wear more to avoid catching cold. Remember to lock the door. Cousin. Good night. She said good night to me. Go back to your room and sleep. What? Let him take my room? Forget it, cousin. Why don't we... Cousin, you'd better think it over I'll never live with such a man. Each of you... Cousin, not in bed? Sleep on my bed. No, I'll return to the room. Cousin, we can talk it over. Nothing to talk about. I'll mimic McEnroe. Good. Are you forcing me to move out? Let's frame him up as the only way out. It's beneath me. No. Who's hiding it? Produce it. What have you lost? Why the noise? Lost money. What have you lost? Money? Who could've taken away this? Maybe someone has borrowed it. Borrowed? I won't take it back now I only want to find out who did it. Think it over. Ask cousin if he has seen it. What happened? What's going on? Pao claimed to have lost something. Cousin, have you taken it? How would he take it? So you've taken it. You mean that doll? I really don't know why. You don't? You stole it from me I really don't know why I don't know why I'm sleeping here either. You're a thief. Don't say that, he's our relative. What's yours is his. What? Can we share this? I won't take it back now. You tramp. You've cuckolded me. Forget it. You'll only embarrass cousin. Don't get it wrong. I didn't touch it. Cousin, buy one for yourself. He's very serious. She has followed me all these years. Tramp, I won't want you any more. We'll contribute money to buy one for you. It takes time to nurture feelings. Give this to cousin. Don't use this to get rid of me. What a frame-up! You're taking me for a nut. This gimmick is not bad. Would he blame us? No, it's for the good of us all. And we don't have to quarrel with Cousin Big. What happened? Pao, are you vying with cousin? Right, that one. Over what? This doll. Who's vying for it? I got one myself. And it has a Birth Certificate. Why get excited over a doll. It's okay, Cousin Big. Cousin often leaves home for trifles. Right. Right, he returned from England for this. Didn't you expel him. What? It's a gift. Right, a gift. Don't you have to go to work. No. Good. Let's go up and change. Pick up your girlfriend. How's Rose now? Keep away. I just want to have a look. Do you want to see... Yes, to see if your glass is clean. Serious. Yes, I'll clean it for you if it's dirty. You're okay, you can read my mind. I was going to clean it. Good, let's wipe it together I'll go and get the things. With cousin Big back, luck's now with us. We're off to win his confidence. On your own now. Meet here at ♪ p.m. Hi, where are you going. - Something important to do. - I know where you're going. Where. You must be... Nonsense, bye. Be here at ♪ p.m. sharp Something fishy. Follow him.

"The moon will hide beyond the sky." We're back. Damn it. Why are you back so easily. Early. A bit early. I'll go up. Cousin Big, come and have a drink. Hi, throw the dart. - Okay. - Cousin, you throw first. Okay -Come on. Find some work to do. Throw, but be careful I am. Let's have a game. Throwing darts? Come on, let me try. Okay. - We do it for gambling. - No problem. What's the stake? How much? We were only joking. Who's going to gamble -I am. Take when you win, but don't pay when you lose. What's the stake -Name it. A hundred dollar per one -Okay. - Hi. - Are you Yung? This is Auntie. Auntie's coming. No, it's long distance call from London. What is it. Have you got that cable. Yes, Cousin Big's already here. Returned? He's departed for nearly a week and you don't even care to call. You're heartless. What do you mean, Auntie? You Cousin Big fell into the Thames. What. He's dead but his body's missing at the morgue Yung, are you listening. I'll win for sure. What happened. What are you doing. Never mind. What a maniac! Why are you screaming. Cousin Big, your turn. There should be one more. Where's is it? Why one short? You flung just now. There were 3. Why is one missing? Look over there. Let me see. Why are you holding a dart I'll look around. Don't tease me I'll twist your head. Show me. It's with you. Let's continue. "Outside the window, the sea reaches to the sky." "Inside the room, love conquers like the sea." "The one I love has the drinker's looks." Cousin Big, can I join you? Would you listen. Yes. Q, go. "You're drunk with sweet wine." "Your fascinating looks make me drunk too." "Love is deeper than wine." "My devotion is sweeter than wine." Cousin Big - I give up. "Why don't you care for me" "I love you, and I do" "whether you love me or not." Are you drunk. No, I'm sleeping. I give up. - Because you've lost. - I'm going to the toilet. How come? What are you. Well, come in. Why are you closing the door. Come in. I got a call from Auntie saying cousin died in England. I didn't believe it but when I helped remove that dart which sank into his head I saw his blood was green. So you think he's a ghost. Cousin, you must relax with your girlfriend. You're making a bad joke. You don't believe me. Do you believe me -And you. Of course, we don't. How can I make you believe me. Cousin Big, what are you doing. So it's you! What are you doing I'm here to see you. No, to see if you're in bed I am not. I'm ironing. Cousin Big, iron it outside. Let me help you. No need -Let me. Cousin Big, the weather in HK is humid. Let me iron the clothes in your wardrobe. No need, I'll do it. What's it. He... You... What's wrong? It's burnt. It's an expensive dress. What? Backbiting me. What's this. Dried beef -Yes. Eat. Cousin Big, I'll pay you back for it. No need. Do you believe it -Yes. Cousin Big, it's shining. You're okay. Go... Don't go I don't feel at ease tonight. No much illusion, I can't hold on. You'd better find someone to accompany me. No. Won't you do me this favor. If I did something bad to my ancestors you'd look down on me even if she forgives me. No, sex is nature. Right, right. Idiot, you draw lots. Cousin Big, calm down. It's my pleasure to sleep with you. You used to induce me to sleep I'll accompany Cousin Big. Q, don't do that. Is that any of your business. So I have someone who cares. Go out... Let's go together. Cousin Big, I'll unfold the bed for you. Boss, the customers are urging. Hurry up. What. Buddy, speak of it no more. Okay, okay. We didn't know it until we got a call from Auntie saying. Cousin Big had died for nearly a week. He felt no pain even though' we ironed him. He felt nothing with a dart stabbed on his head. They call this an aggrieved ghost. Aggrieved ghost. Brother, do us a favor. Some customers are getting impatient. Tell him to go somewhere else. Hurry up! Stop talking. When a man dies, his soul leaves his body and it decays, leaving only a skeleton. Put sugar or vinegar first. Put them at the same time. That's just like Cousin Big. He doesn't decay after death. His soul was incomplete due to over scare. When it calmed down it didn't know what happened. He didn't know he was dead then. Right. He didn't seem to know he's dead. Should we or shouldn't we tell him. We should've done that on the night of the 2nd ♪-day period or he may never reincarnate. We must keep it a secret from him. He is our cousin. We should give him a chance to reincarnate. What about the $7 million remittance. Which is more important. The money or Cousin Big. Cousin Big of course. So you still have a heart. Come to me if anything goes wrong. Here's one month's wage. Take it. Are you firing me. No, this is your one month's bonus. Please do your best to preserve my stall. That sounds human. I'll start. Cousin, we'll follow you for a living. "I, I want... I want your" "I want your... I want your love." Cousin, I'm at the entrance. Don't I told you to watch me I fell from bed onto the floor I nearly fell into another room. But you didn't wake up. Fire! - Where's the fire? - Here. What now. Put it out. Put it out. It's put out, it's all right. Cousin. Fire again. Cousin Big, what now. What now. Cousin, come out. I'm waiting. Cousin Big, don't be impulsive. Go away. Please don't -Go away. Your hand's stuck. Cousin Big -I must go. Cousin Big, I must sacrifice myself. Come. You're great, you've cooled my desire. It's okay. Go to bed. It's okay now. Remove all earth gods first. Remove the 8-diagram mirror. Hide the face of the goddess. Put aside all garlic and onion. Wait. Let me search. You're wearing a cross. Don't scare the spirit out of him I'd better put it into my pocket. What. A cross chain. Remember not to mention the cross. Bad. What. Some more crosses? Put into my pocket. No, Mary's in my room. Your girlfriend. No, Marry the Holy Mother's picture. Bad. It's serious. What's it, Cousin Big. I can't see myself. Right. Let me see. What's it. Bad, even I can't see myself. Right. Why. Could we all be ghosts? Nonsense. It's not so simple. Let's find out. We must find out the truth. Let's go back and see. Why is the mirror missing. There's no mirror here. I removed it yesterday. Bastard, that's no fun at all. Watch out. I feel something fishy. Recently I've been feeling dizzy chilly and light like a feather I've been back for a few days but I never feel hungry or thirsty. It seems something's wrong indeed I think so too. Could you be unwell I think so too. You must see a doctor, Cousin Big. See a doctor now before it's too late. Right, let me take you there. The lift was out of order. I'm breathless. Miss. Who's seeing the doctor? Line up. It's me, miss. Register then. Keep him company. I'll go to register. Miss. I can't stand the smell of medicine. You didn't say that last time. It was different, I was ill. Fixed. Yes, those nurses are obliging. Great. Cousin Yung's okay. Beautiful -So-so. Mr Chou, take your cousin's temperature. Take it yourself. Mr Wu, open your mouth, please. He has no body temperature. Am I to do it for him. I have an idea. Is it finished. Not so soon. Chang LI-ling, please come in. Damn, I took the wrong thermometer. How's it, miss. A little fever. Go and see the doctor. What now. Go in with him. What's your trouble. What's your trouble. Aren't you the doctor. If he knew, he wouldn't have come. You doctors are all like that. If you can't find out you say something to scare. Either he has no pulse or he has no body temperature. Sometimes you might say he has no breath. Are you consulting me or he is. He is. Let me check. Pull up the sleeve. He has no heartbeat. Is that right. He has no body temperature. Is that right. And he has no breath. How's it, doctor? Is he all right? Yes, perfectly all right. Thank you. Let's go. I knew you're all right. There's no point in seeing doctor. Thank you, doctor. How strange. Come back. What's the matter. My head got twisted after I woke up. It can hardly move. It's common with sleepers. Let me twist it back for you. Sit here. Sit still. I haven't done it yet. I'm trying to reduce his pain. It really doesn't hurt. Good, have a good night's sleep and you'll be all right tomorrow. Cousin Big, you don't need my company tonight. Do you resent doing it. No, if you go on, you may not stand it. This is not the right remedy I know, I've thought it over. What I've fallen in love with Rose Rose? Who's Rose. Since he returned he's seen only the nurses and Miss Wang upstairs. A kind-natured man like him won't love a cold-blooded nurse I've decided to marry her and start a new life together I knew he'd be mine. Now I can use it after so long. Aren't you happy for me. Yes. Cousin Big, when will be the wedding. The sooner the better or I may not control myself. He sounds serious. But he's a ghost. What are you doing? You're sneaky I'll take a bath and go to bed. Q, he... From the humanistic standpoint we must stop that. It's cruel to tell her that. Cousin Yung, you're best for the job. Me. What are you doing here. You've fixed it. What about me. How do I know. Am I to accompany you all my life and you back out. Miss, when have I done that I planned it all by myself. I can plan something too. But don't be in my way. Miss Wang. Open up. I've something important to talk to you. Go away -Miss Wang. Give me your word -Okay. Go now -Miss Wang, please open up. I've something important to talk to you. I know. You do. You mean Cousin Big... Right, it's about him. Be mentally prepared before I tell you. I already have everything ready. Cousin Big is not an ordinary man. He's an extraordinary man I don't think it's true but I must believe he's a ghost. Must be a ghost, if not a man. Listen, he's a male ghost. Of course. Listen, he was drowned in the. Hames last week. Are you serious. Of course. If you marry him he'll scare you to death. Never. He walks like a feather. Just like you I hear that those ghosts can. This way. Right, be serious, Put it on. Like me. Right. Help! Help. Miss, don't go in. Ghost. Come in at once. Bad, bad. Help. What's it. Help. What happened. What. Go now -Why. A ghost -Ghost? Where? Where. Come in quick. Cousin Big, what happened I don't know. Why is it so noisy. They've all gone down. Have they? Let me go and see. You have no pants on. What are you up to. You may scare them to death I wanted to. So I can get someone for company like you did I'm different. Mine is already at death's door. That's easy. Don't be tough. I can't wait any longer. After the 14th I'll be a lonely ghost forever. You won't want me to go unremembered. You think he'll love you I'll make him fall in love at 1st sight. Miss Wang, let me do it. Come on. Miss, miss -I'm passing out. Cousin Big, lend a hand. Lend a hand. What is it. Q, what are you doing I've done nothing I opened the door and she fell inside. How come. Help her to the sofa. Bring balm at once. I'll call an ambulance. She seems to have been raped. She's used to it. What did you say. She's my cousin. For the head. Gi, told you not to come too late. Now you're in such a mess. Where am I. Don't be afraid. You're safe now. Excuse me. Cousin. I met a thug. Thug. A villain. I'm afraid. They're all good men. - Lie down and take a rest. - Right, they're all good men. Cousin, do you care for her. Take care of her. It hurts. Where. Here. Rub it for me. Rose, jealous? She's your cousin. I must help her I was putting a towel over her. Why use your eyes. Who'll help me if I drop my quilt. As of tonight, I'll do it for you. It means three ghosts I our house. Right. Q's in a dangerous situation. Wish he had a lucky charm. The ordinary are always lucky. Cousin Big would help him. He adores him. Are you going to stand by. We may take Cousin Big for a dead man but we must help Q. Come back with me. Come back? Yes. Cousin, man can't win over ghost. Right, good won't compete with evil. We must wait till they're asleep. Asleep? Would ghosts sleep. Don't be sorry. I'll be responsible. I'm damned, I've failed my ancestors I've failed myself and you. Idiot, it's love. Don't be mushy. How am I to face the people. I'm not afraid. Why are you. No one would know if we keep it to ourselves. Where are you going. Get a tablet and have the married name added. A tablet. Although I wasn't born a Wu. But now I'm a ghost member of the Wu clan. What did you say. Soon you'll understand. So it's here. At last there's a shrine. Enshrined I'll tell you later. Excuse me. Where are you going at this hour. To tell my parents about us. Why are you walking this side. To save walking through the stairs. Bye-bye. Wait for my good news. Watch out. So she's flying down the street. May I dance with you. Play him like a toy. It's fun. You're sweating. Let me wipe it for you. Gi, how long have we known each other. Already two hours. But it looks like ages. Frankly, we can't get along because we have nothing in common. Never. We met by chance, but we love each other. Cousin, what now I'll lure Q out and you take him away. Would you regret it. No. I'm ready to do anything for you. Go up. You can see our future. You'll go to paradise soon. Put your head in. We'll meet inside. Q, don't stand on the table. Come down I'll get someone to fix the fan. Q, is she your girlfriend. Don't be in the way. I'm going to paradise. No hurry. Miss, he's a bit cranky. Don't scare your girlfriend. I'm going to paradise. Take a taxi. I'll pay for it. Go now. Yes, go now. He's coming out. Take care of him. Many people outside daren't come in. Don't be afraid. Q, run quick. Q, what are you doing. Miss, let's talk it over. The day's breaking soon. Q, come here. Q, tell them you're ready to die for me. Yes, I must be with her. You'll die if he doesn't. Cousin, everyone has his own wish. Don't stop him if he wants it. Yes, but I don't want Q to die. Keep an eye on Q. Cousin Big, this house is haunted. Right. Yes, let's go together. I told you not to come back I can't help it. Bad, Q. How are we to go down. - We'll get killed if we jump. - Right. We must, for the sake of Q. Wait for me. I can't find my underpants. Underpants. Where's the underpants. Q Is it all right -I don't know. Q You are already too late. This makes sure of no reincarnation for you. Choose the undies you like. KISS ME Come here and help me rescue Q. Quick. Stop his backside. We'll be finished if it leaks. Help. Master, help. It's terrible. The ghosts are coming down. Run. Run quickly -Go upstairs quick. You're still holding the underpants. She may smell it. Where's Q. Q? Missing I mustn't kill my lover with my own hands.

Block the entrance. Q, come out. I want to die. Keep it up. What are you doing. Keep away! Don't touch him. Take away the plug. Block the entrance. What now. Wait till the dawn. Right, ghosts are afraid of the dawn. Cousin, you play well. Don't expose it. Coming again. Why should we be afraid of her. Well, why should we be afraid of ghosts. Man's afraid of ghosts. Not always. Would ghost be afraid of men I think ghosts try to scare because they're afraid. Right, nothing has happened to us. No. To save our home, let's fight. Don't be afraid of her. Come on... Scare her. I'll kill you. Q, you want to die. You're bewitched by a ghost. You think so I know she's a ghost. Keep away. Gi. It's dawn. It's not me. Q, I must leave. Gi. Don't tug at me. Follow him. Gi. Q, open the door. Q, I must leave I'll go with you I won't hurt you. Let me go I won't let you go. - See you again next life. - Q, open up. Gi, Gi. She's gone. Gone. Q, so much the better.
