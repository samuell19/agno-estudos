Hi. I'll try to explain what this movie is about. Maybe most of you know this a ready, but I'll explain it gain just in case. There are six stories. Four of them have a beginning, but not an ending. That is to say, they stop at the middle. They have no ending. Then, there is episode five, which, like a short story, has a beginning and an end. Finally, there is episode six, which begins in the middle and ends the film. The film, this, I'm sure you all know is titled "La flor". What else? Each episode has a genre, so to speak. The first episode could be regarded as a B movie, the kind that Americans used to shoot their eyes closed, and now just can't shoot anymore The second episode... is a sort of musical with a touch of mystery. The third episode is a spy movie. The fourth episode is difficult to describe. Not even I, in the moment of making this prologue, have a clear idea. The fifth one is inspired by an old French film. The last one... is about some captive women the 19th century... who return from the desert from the Indians after many years. Now, the punchline of the whole movie... lies in the fact that all the episodes... star the same four women in different roles. Valeria, Elisa, Laura, and Pilar. I'd say the movie is about them, and, somehow, for them. I think that's about it. For now. - Stop. - Why? What's the matter? Stop, stop, stop! Please, not again... Please, not again... Are you okay? Is it something I did? Did something happen to you? You're not angry at me, right? No, take me home. - Yeah, sure. - Take me home. My Angry sister calls to arms René Char Guys, keep it down, please. It's too loud. - Marcela, can you come? - Yeah. I've a problem with the weavings from the Talangasta site. Still with Talangasta? That should be in the lab! What happened? I had some questions for you or the Doctor. - Look here. - Yes? This is camelid, but it's more of a late er treatment. Yes, but this is something you should work out for tomorrow, next week the Chileans will call us 3 days a week... I told him it is not camelid. Coming! I don't know about it. Send it to the lab at nee, Dario. But how do I label it? I don't... Look, I've only got 5 bottles of phosphoric acid. 5? There was enough acid for the whole winter! We cleaned 10 lithic tools last week. This is not the time, Silvana! We are closing for a wee. Have you talked to the Doctor? I told Yanina 10 times... No, don't even start. Please, don't start. Yanina! Work it out with her. Where is Yanina? At my desk. We won't finish the report on time. Marcela, we have a problem. Marcela, can you come? Coki leaves at 8, she says she old you, and Nancy can't come before 9... Yes, I forgot all about it. You can't stay, can you? Way, I have to look after my grandchildren. Was any other day... Okay, I'll ask Coki, don't worry about it. Okay, but don't forget, it's a nightmare out there. What is it now? Nothing, I forgot Coki was leaving today at 8, to fire up the generator. Silvana told me she told you we're out of phosphoric acid. What an ass! I asked her if we had to restock before closing... and she told me to wait until we spoke with Lucia. She screwed this up, not me! Hello? For you. Yes? Where? No, I have no idea. Nobody told me anything... and we have no orders from Doctor. Could you go to the front door... and check what's going on with some cargo? Where am I supposed to get acid from now? Yes. No, don't let them in. What did you say? Don't let them unload the cargo. Okay, tell them to load the cargo back. I never spoke with Giardina, I'm out of the loop. No, they can't leave that here. Okay, I'll be right there. You talk to them, Marcela! They say Giardina sent them... and they have to unload the cargo today. They can't, We're about to close! Yes, I told them, but... Maybe we could take everything to the back room. No, and where's Lucia? - Should I call her? - Yes, please. Do we unload here? No, the Doctor is not here and I can't accept the cargo. But we have to be at the site before 3. We can't take it. We're due there before 3! Sorry, but what site are you talking about? The Rodeo dig! Someone took this downhill... and the Giardina told us to bring it here. Right, I'm truly sorry, but I can't accept this without the University form. But Giardina told us to get the cargo here ASAP. No, nobody spoke with Giardina, nobody told me anything... You can't leave this cargo here. What will I say to Giardina? I will go fetch her. Careful, don't let them leave Giardina told us to deliver the cargo. If you have a problem with that, you must call him. No, I don't know a thing... Hi, how are you? Could you show me the delivery form? What's that? The form require by the University. No, Mr. Giardina told us to deliver the cargo today. I understand, but Giardina doesn't work here... and he's not authorized to send shipments here... without a delivery form. Marce, sign the 2-13. I'll call Giardina right now. Should we take this in? Yes, follow her, please. - What site is it? - Cerro Blanco, El Rodeo. Yeah, pure rocks. Yes, they'll get the cargo. Follow me, please! We will have to speak with Giardina. Be careful. He sends me a box of stones the day before Easter, and I have to go on a trip. What a dope. The cargo should be with him. I won't lift a finger without the delivery form. Do me a favour, Yani, take my jacket, will you? He doesn't want to waste the whole weekend... looking after a bunch of rocks... and he wants me to do it for him. I'll leave them at the base this afternoon. In temporary storage. I won't turn on a whole freezer just for this asshole. Good morning! Good morning, Doctor. Do you have a second? Sure, tell me. Look, I'm a bit be ind with the Tarangasta dating. - What's the matter? - How do I label them? - "Camelids." - Camelids? Of course, that's vicuña. Remember those Ansilta poncho The Italians sent over? That's the same technique, With borax instead of clay. So I label them "camelids"? - Camelids, for sure. - Great. And don't dally with those petroglyphs. They should all be indexed by next week. - Okay, Doctor. - Thank you. Thank you, Doctor. Hello, good morning. How are those PHT coming along Not great I have 5 bottles of phosphoric acid, and less than a quarter of nitrate. Top off that quarter with iodine-diluted alcohol. Iodine? As a reactive? Yes, it works as a reactive. It is just for the weekend. - Do you have iodine? - Yes. Perfect. Doctor, we have a schedule problem. Coki leaves early, Julia can't come today, and I should be leaving... Don't worry, we're staying to look after a cargo. Tell Julia not to come. Yani, can you stay? Yes! Great. Coki can leave at 6 so she can see her grandchildren. One moment, please. - Doctor? - Yes. Giardina. Put him through. Hello? How are you, Giardina? Yes, this is Lucia Conti. Yes, we're unloading the cargo. No, I saw your missed call, I didn't know it was so urgent. Right, because I can't... Right, I can't do anything without a delivery form. Hello, Giardina? I can barely hear you. Why don't you call me later? Hello? No, we didn't ship anything to Stockholm. I don't know which mummy is that, Giardina. Which mummy? No. Hello? Hello? He said something about the Stockholm Conference. What the hell does he know? Is he an archeologist now? Do you have a minute? - What is it? - Com with me. Done. That was rough. I thought he was going to say no. He was about to leave and we delayed him. He showed me his bag, the fishing rods... And his wife was waiting in the truck, what a saint. Still, I won't pity him, I'm even worse off here. But the pieces are goo I think they are worth it. For the cover of the Stockholm Catalogue, they want the bigger photo, the one with the hand raised. It is good. Yes, it's worth it. You were planning on going to Neuquen, right? You poor thing. A whole weekend indoors with this mummy. And me, I try to take 1 week off, and this pops up. Hans couldn't believe it. These things never happen in Austria. "How can you be so messy? You're not telling me something!" That poor thing. When I told him we were sending them to Stockholm, he was so proud... - He'll be there, did I tell you? Yeah, he'll give a lecture on the Sorocaba Tombs. Once he calmed down after I canceled our short trip, he was actually happy. I love him. He thinks highly of my work. He's proud of what I do. That's rare, isn't it? Because you know, men here may be academic and all that, but they're so sexist... They don't like it when you do better than them. Shit, speak of the devil... Should I make a quick stop? Yeah, I should think so. I can't stand this guy. Marzico, what's up? What's going on? What's up, doc? Marcela! Hi, what's going on? Asking for favors, as usual. So? Did you get help? Yes, Cinetti took care of everything once again. Whatever you need, you can call me. Yeah, we know. Marzico, bye now, we're in a hurry. I thought you'd be on the road by now. You're not closing for Easter? That was the idea, but we have to stay now. You'll be all alone at the Institute? Yeah... Whatever you need you can count on me. I'm just a phone call away. Great, bye now. Do you have my number? Of course we do! Call me then. - Sure thing. We have to go. - I won't keep you, then! Bye! Thanks. Thanks... He creeps me out, I can't help it. He is so disgusting... Yanina is not seeing him, right? She says she isn't, but... It's the same old story. I know. I spoke to her, but she won't listen. She's so naive. She believes every word he says What a lying scumbag. One day I wish I had the nerve to run him over with the truck. Hey, I made a joke. You can laugh. Sorry, I'm a bit distracted. Is something the matter? No... Right! I almost forgot. You went out with Claudio. Something happened? No... Well, more or less... "More or less". You'll end up driving him crazy. Yani is a mess, but at least... Speaking of Yanina, tell her to start working on the mummies, or this whole operation will go to hell. What's the matter with this radio? Damn you! By the time we realized it, we had he mummy with us. Yes, a pain in the ass. One Giardina. He always does the same. It's just the two of us. Locked in here, yeah. It's more practical than coming and going the whole weekend. Marcela sleeps over there. I'm thinking of keeping her company. Yes, alone with the mummy. It's her, how funny. I won't take the call. She's good, but at times seems disoriented. It's like she's coming down with something. Fuck, what now? Excuse me. - Hello. - Is everything okay? Yes, I'm skyping right now. What? But she had to dust all the artifacts. Just a moment. Only one? I told her to clean all 3. Di she use phosphoric acid? The mummy. Did she use the acid on the mummy? That cunt. A good-for-nothing who works for us. Yes? Are you with the mummy? And there's no more acid? Well, then go get the acid, Call me when you get it One second, don't hang up. It's always the same. I feel like I'm their mother. One is horny all the time, and the other one is a prude. No, she doesn't understand a word of Catalan. No, don't worry about it. Not one word. Yes? That's impossible, there must be some. Go to the storage room, open the green cabinet, and, once you're there, check again... Marce... Easy. Were you scared? There, there... Do you want to go home? Are you sure you want to work? Do I call somebody to pick you up? No. Okay, if you don't feel good, tell me. Get yourself a cup of coffee. Thank you. Where were you? I bet you went to bed at 8 a.m. No, I swear, I went to bed super early. I don't know what happened, I couldn't wake up. Yeah, super early, I'm sure. Really. I left at around 7 yesterday. Well? Where are they? Follow me. Are these all of them? The black one is missing. I gave him something to calm down. I drew a blood sample to have it analyzed. It's strange. The symptoms are strange. I never saw something like that. But let's wait for the results to come back. Rabies. No. The symptoms do not match A rabid animal is afraid of water. This cat just can't stop drinking water. This level of thirst is abnormal even. Really, its symptomology is quite rare. Dilated pupils, loss of hair... And something very strange: a strong epidermal lesion. Some sort of welt in the inguinal region... that keeps growing. It doubled in size in the half hour I treated him. Then there's hyperactivity, aggressive behavior. A viciousness that surpasses all known pathologies. I'm at a loss. And the other cats? - This cat killed them. - Dam But let's not get ahead of ourselves. I'll send the sample to the lab to rule some things out. Keep him isolated. You can give him water. Try not to touch him, it could be dangerous. Okay. Call me if anything changes, or I'll drop by tomorrow. Thanks for coming, we didn't know what else to do. Call me anytime. Good. Yani, come here. Help me. Come on, move it. Are you okay? Calm down, it's over now. Do you feel better? Can I call you again? I'll call you. Come on. Let's get to work. It's occupied! It's you. What's that on you face? Nothing, I'm going home. - Can I take you? - No, it's okay. Come! Come, get in. No, I'm not feeling well. Come on, I'll take you! No, I'm dizzy, I want to go home. Come on! I'll take you home. No, really, I feel like crap. Load the bike and I'll take you home. Come on, don't be silly. Come on. We're not having a good day, are we? Did you stay up late? Don't whine about it No, I didn't stay up late. I'm just not feeling well. You could be pregnant you know. Shut up, you jerk. Where are you taking me? I told you I was going home! Come on, I'm going home, I feel like shit. Take me home. You're a bit feisty. Take me home. Now. Take me home now. Let me tell you something, girl, with all due respect. Once you get on the Marzico-mobile, there's a set of rules... Last night. I got home late, around 9. Already, from far away, I could see something was off. Something strange in my house. I walked in and I saw everything ad been tossed around. And I thought, "We've been robbed! A burglar has broken in and stole everything." I ran out to get the guys at the roundhouse, I came back rushing with them... They checked everything. Everything was tossed around. Everything. There was shattered glass. The table was scratched as if it'd been scratched by an animal. So the lads told me, "This was a fox. A fox broke in." So I told them, "What fox? There are no foxes around here!" And in that moment, we heard a noise, a strange noise... which was coming from down there... I told them, "Did you hear that?" And suddenly, once again, the noise. So we slowly walked out... to see where it was coming from And we saw her. She was motionless, all curled up, like you're seeing her now. She's been like that all night. Motionless. Poor girl. It's strange. It's all very strange. I understand. I think she trashed the place. Most likely, yes. She got in, trashed everything, and then stopped moving. Just like the cat. Ma'am, your daughter will be okay. We'll take her to the Institute... to make her feel more comfortable. I'm worried sick about her. Don't worry. We'll take her. Take some clothes with you. I'll pack a bag. Yes, pack her a bag. Marcela will help you. I'll help you. Come with me. This is not right. We should call a doctor. She can't go to the doctor. I'm a vet, not a physician. She can't go to the doctor. Did you hear about Marzico? Who? Marzico, the foreman at the mine. That's right. He was attacked by 4 guys. That's the thing, it wasn't 4 guys. Just like the cat Come on. Take her to the ceramics storage, it's empty. On the right! Take her. I'll go check. Well? You see. He's lashing out again. After he calms down, he gets vicious again. This symptoms are recurrent. It's a cyclical behavior. You should try to think when this might've started. Did something strange happen... before the cat and Yanina fell ill? Maybe some sort of episode or some situation...? - Can you stop this? I turned on the heating... and locked the door with two latches. Where's Claudio? Come here, come here. Come here! Come here. Let's go. Easy, easy! Come! I'm going crazy. I'm starting to think Claudio is an idiot. He seems to like this, he lays detectives. He asked me whether something strange happened. You know what happened? I canceled my vacations. All because Giardina sent some mummies, that asshole. What's with you? Why you looking at me like that? The mummies. No! The cat died. Bingo... Sir! We're screwed. When did it happen? 4 days ago. The same day you sent over the bodies. What a drag, poo I can't be of much help. I'm leaving tomorrow. Right, but we need you to come over now. Rig-ht, but I'm busy with this, and I won't be finishing any time soon. And I should also get ready for my trip tomorrow. You realize the spuriousness of the situation? Yes, of course, of course. It's just that I'm not good at this paranormal thing. I'm an amateur. You have to know your stuff. It's a delicate matter. Giardina, listen. If we thought about you... It's because you caused us a great problem, as usual. You broke every protocol, guideline and procedure, and you took advantage of our good will and trust, by thrusting upon us, without a moment's notice, material that must be certified by the National Secretary, the CONICET or, at least, the University. Material you give away to any tourist... who digs up a hole somewhere on the mountain... you bring us archaeological stuff whenever you please. Now shit's gotten real, somebody's life is on the line. You must take responsibility of that material, and all the phenomena associated with it, because, if the worst happens, and it probably will, you'll have a big problem your hands and I'm not talking about losing your license, I'm talking about a trial... for mismanagement of archaeological heritage... and as an accessory to a murder. If I were you, I'd dust off all of my magic handbooks... and see why that mummy... is acting upon a poor innocent girl who has nothing to do, who's at death's door... thanks to your negligence and lack of consideration! Okay, let's relax... Let's calm down. I'll see if I can get in touch with Cruz. That's an idea. I could try that Yes, calling Cruz would be the best course of action. Can it wait until tomorrow? Honestly, Giardina, I don't know. Give me one day. Hi. Hey. I fell asleep. It must have been a rough night. It wasn't that bad. Did you get any sleep? No... Well, just a little. Any news around here? Nothing. I checked on her constantly. She didn't move all night. Around one, I checked her BP and temperature. She was fine. Around three, she dozed off for a while. What do you think? I don't know. The cat went a whole day with asthenia and anorexia. She's been like that for a day and a half. The aggressive stage should've already started. I don't know. Maybe nothing happens. It would be good if she stayed like that. This really scares me. Can I ask you something? Is there something you'd like to tell me? Yani? Yani, are you okay? Yani? Yanina? Yanina! Yanina, are you okay? Yanina? Yani! Yani? Yanina, are you okay? What is that noise? What is it? She's awake. It opens from the inside. I'll call Giardina. No. There's no time. Get my keys and go to the cabin. There's a shotgun in the locker. Get it. It's okay, I'll get it. Lock that door. Excuse me, are you from around here? Yeah. I'm looking for Lucia Conti. That's me. I'm here because the Border Patrol called me. A transference problem. A psycho-transference problem. Okay. Some issue with some girl. Giardina sent you? No, I don't know who made the call, but is it here? Yeah, sure. I'm sorry. Please, come in. Nice to meet you. Daniela Cruz. Any physical symptoms? Yes, hair loss and cold sores. Then she got violent, then she calmed down. You'll see. - Verbal phase? - What's that? Did she speak in tongues? In Quechua or some dialect? I don't know. My Go... It looks like moving day. Hi. I'm Daniela. Poor thing. - Hi. Daniela. - What's up? I'll ask you to help clear all this, alright? - Are you going in? - She must be subdued at once. Do I clear everything? Yes. What type of soil do you have here? Soil? Yes, what's its composition? Axinite I guess, but it's pretty much eroded. Okay, I can work with that. Can I ask you something? Yes. Go outside and fill a jar with dirt, the drier, the better. - Ajar? - Yes, like a jar of jam or mayo. Yes. And feathers too! Feathers from a flying bird, not a hen. Look in the old archives, under "Plumage", quick! Poor thing, she's too aggressive. Step aside. Move over! Let her through, Claudio! Come. Come. Hold this. Give me the statuette. Hold this tight until I tell you. Give this to your friend when she comes back. - Is it locked? - Yes. Open it. Are you sure you want to go in there? I'm coming in! - What's her name? - Yanina. Do you have everything? Yes, here. Those are condor feathers. It's done. She'll be okay. She needs to rest. She's likely to sleep for 1 or 2 days, but she'll be okay. Do you need us to do anything? Take her. Call your friend, tell him to take her home. - You got her? - Yeah. Now I need to see the entity. - The mummy? - The mummy. Let me see. Of course. What did she expect? The feathers too. It could've been a lot worse. Why? What is it? She's one of the Three Queens. I'll tell you more about it. No No No more I know it Have mercy And what's that? Listen... Yeah, I know, I was late from the fourth one on. No, one other thing. Move away just a tad from the mike, I got clipping on all the last takes. Okay, either way, I started late. Don't worry about that. From the fourth verse? No, let's take it from the top. Okay, good idea... No No No more I know it Have mercy And what's that? Let's do something, Ricky. What if you move around a bit? Can you sing standing up? You're a bit stiff. I don't know, I'll try. I'll try moving and see what happens. Okay, let's try that. Rolling third verse. I know it Have mercy And what's that? Take five is a bit... I don't know, it's a bit off. Would you like to try? Sure, go ahead. I'll loop it, so you can sing many takes. And what's that? And what's that? And what's that? And what's that? And what's that? And what's that? And what's that? And what's that? I don't know, maybe the second to last one? Yes, that would be the closest take, but... I'd try recording from the top. Yes, this one is hard, right? Kind of... Yeah, but relax, don't worry about it. I'll tell you what, Ricky. Let's call it a day, okay? Let's listen to it tomorrow and work out the details. Maybe we have the take... and we're stressing over nothing. So no more takes today? No, no, relax. Let's take it down a notch. It's our first day. We're exhausted, did a million things today. Let's see how this data 'backs up'. Right, yeah. You thought it was weird, right? Weird? No, not at all. I think it went great. Plus, it's the first day. Right, first day... We're in great shape. You just have to connect a bit more with the song, make it yours... This is all new for me, you know? Yeah, I understand, but relax. I think it went great, you know? Now get your mind off it, get some rest. Tomorrow will be another day, as they say, right? But I have faith in this. It can't miss. Hit. Hit. Hit. You think we have a hit? It's awesome. This elevator is going up. Hey, Ricky! Hey. This elevator is going down. Well? I don't know. Underground It doesn't work? What do you mean "it doesn't work"? Are you listening to what you're saying, Frank? Do you understand what you're saying? I'll try to answer you rationally. No, it's my turn to speak, Frank! It's my turn! No, I don't want to listen to you! I'm sick and tired of listening to you, Frank! You want to talk?! Then talk, Frank! Talk, Frank! Talk! Ice. Can I stop you right there? Yes, I know, but let me tell you something. I don't want to be reasonable! I don't care about it! Do you want my opinion on what you're saying? Do you want my opinion? I think those are the words of a scoundrel. Yeah. The words of a scoundrel. Shut up! You know where I've been, where I come from, right? You know what I went through, right? Because, if you knew, you would know that I would never do such thing. I'd rather vanish in the air, I would prefer humiliation, or to disappear. If you knew me, you would know... that I would never show an iota of weakness... to that person! Yes, to that person, the person you're defending! Yes, you're defending him! Yes, you're defending him, Frank! And if you knew you would also know... that defending him means becoming my enemy. Would you like to be my enemy, Frank? Would you like to be my enemy? It's not like that! It's not! It's not like that and you know it! Yes, you know it better than anybody else, Frank! No? What do you mean by "no". Then what is a traitor? Define the word "traitor", Frank! And Andrea Nigro? What about Andrea Nigro? What about Andrea Nigro, Frank?! Andrea Nigro? Look. I know what I have to do... I've never stopped doing my job. And I'll honour my commitment to you... the way I've always honored it, but I made up my mind. I made a decision, Frank. You can either be my ally in that decision, or you can be that other person's ally. It is your choice. But if you choose me, I don't want to hear this kind of nonsense anymore, nor any other statement that might suggest... the faintest notion of conceding anything to that person, you hear me? Did you get that, Frank? I don't want to hear about it ever again Ever again! Never again, Frank! Never again! Roll it. I'm the fire stalking you That will soon turn your damned soul into ashes I'm the poisoned arrowhead aimed at your heart I'm your menace, you ordeal I'm silently looking for you in the dark of the night I'm madness, I am the fuse The bomb about to go off that it's too late to disarm I'm the dagger If you pull me out of your chest Nothing will be left I am hatred, I am hell I'm the messenger carrying your eternal punishment I am the winter that makes your inner spring wither I am the storm, the beast The panther that slowly creeps up on you I'm the one counting the days Until I see you kneeling before me I am Death I've always lived in you and you've never realized it One day you made me cry No One day you broke my heart No I'm going after you and I won't stop Until we're face to face No more You didn't know what love was I know it But by force you shall understand Have mercy That my fury, hatred, contempt and spite Are not my worst flaws And what's that? It doesn't work. He's right. It doesn't work. What do you think? I don't know. About what exactly? What am I supposed to do? You're not talking? Yes... No, I don't know. I've got no idea. Maybe you should try talking things over. I don't know. Ricky and you. OUR GREATEST SUCCESS IS HAVING FOUND EACH OTHER Do you really think so? No. Bring me another one. Tell me something. You know What story? The story. Our story. Do you know it? Yes. I think so. About your beginnings and all of that. Okay. Let's hear that story. Have a seat and tell the story. Both of you had gigs same night, same theater... In the same town. A small rural town. You'd never met, but, when he heard yo sing, he fell in love. And he waited for you after your concert. It was a rainy night. There was terrible storm. The rain fell so hard... that, when both of you finished with your respective shows, you couldn't even leave the theater. Everybody had left, and you stayed behind ting for the storm to pass. You ended up talking like 3 hours. The rain wouldn't let up. And during those 3 hours you fell in love. Yes. What else? When the rain stopped, you wandered for hours along the empty streets. Talking and singing. And then there was the tree. Tell me about the tree. At one point, you reached a park that had this big old tree, and he told you, "When we reach the tree, I'll kiss you." So you slowly walked up to the tree, side by side, as if you were afraid, until you reached the tree, you took his hand, and you had your first kiss. That's what the book says. LIVING FOR LOVING It's beautiful. And... At one point, you reached a lagoon, and you stayed up to watch the sun rise in the lagoon. That's where you wrote your first song together. "Rain." IT INCLUDES THE Nº 1 HIT "RAIN" RICARDO IS SINGING HIS GREATEST LOVE SONGS OF ALL TIMES FEATURING SINGER VICTORIA ARAGÓN It's true that it was raining a lot. It was raining a lot, but we weren't in a theater. It was a rural com unity centre. Some event for the elderly So lame... It's not true we met there. We were already together by then. We met when I was 17 and he was 38. He was the first man I'd ever been with in my life. The only one, in fact. He treated me badly. He told me he wanted to teach me, but he would compare me with the other women of his life. Each and every one of them had left him. One woman after the other, one singer after the other, until the one thing he had left was just a 17-year old girl... who had never sung a song in her life. But that night was different. We finished the gig and it was pouring down outside We didn't have enough money to call a cab... to take our instruments to the motel. We waited 30 minutes, an hour... It was still raining. ere about to despair. We were ravenous and everything was closed. The only thing he had on him was his little bottle of gin. A sad bottle he'd always carry with him to help him sing. He couldn't even sing those terrible old boleros... we played in those days. He wouldn't even look at me. He stared at the rain, mesmerized... God knows what was going through his mind, what he was thinking, but I couldn't take my eyes off of him. And only then, believe it or not, only then I realize who he was, after 5 years of being together. That man, who had been the only person in my life for 5 years, the one with whom my life had started, the one who taught me everything the one who called all the shots, the one who knew my future even better than myself my king, my lord and master... was a moron, a wretched man. A worthless, helpless, little man. Who stared at the rain without knowing what to do, as if he were a bird or a dog. That was my man. I was there because of that man. Do you know it? Sure. Sing it. No, I can't sing. Sing it. It's raining in the empty city Through the empty streets, our lives go away It's raining and you're by my side if you were somewhere else As if you were a stranger Your solitary eyes tare at the void stare at you I see a broken man Somebody I don't know Somebody who's not the man I love But something happened that night. We were still there, the rain was coming down harder, and he wouldn't even glance at me. And I couldn't stop glaring at him, hating him, wishing he was struck dead lightning. But suddenly I noticed something. What caught my attention was his absolute stillness, as if he'd seen something that would rescue us. Like a castaway who suddenly sees a ship in the distance. But it wasn't that. He was silent, standing still... Suddenly, he started turning his head, almost imperceptibly, and I realized he was crying. Everything changed for me. And I thought to myself, "This man, "this wretched man, "is poor devil who can't even look at her woman in the eyes... "when he's crying, "is the man I'll spend my whole life with, "and everything I do, I'll do it with him, "whatever it is, whatever happens, "It won't be up to him anymore, It'll be up to me." It was a sudden realization, an epiphany, which came to me when I saw him crying. Like when you see your parents cry. That's it, they're not your parents anymore. Right then and the he stopped being a man He became a cause, a destination, a banner... Do you know what I mean? And from that moment on that would be my life: him. We're just a couple of shadows Just two ghosts Our story is about to end I claim, this is not enough That's not how a brave heart says goodbye When it stopped raining, he could barely walk. I managed to take him to the hotel. Then I went back twice to carry the instruments back, but I was happy. I walked through the streets with a smile, as if I'd emerged victorious from a battle. The part about the tree - he made that up I think he'd read it somewhere. I left him sleeping in the room... and I walked back he lagoon. It was the break of dawn. And that's when I wrote the song, by myself. Like always, like all our songs. And that's when it all started. Play it. It's raining in the empty city Through the empty street our lives go away It's raining and you're by my side As if you were somewhere else As if you were a stranger Your solitary eyes Stare at the void While I stare at you I see a broken man Somebody I don't know Somebody who's not the man I love We're just a couple of shadows Just two ghosts Our story is about to end I mean, this is not enough That's not how a brave heart says goodbye And I swear to myself that I'll fight for you That I'll be by your side when the end comes I must be strong and I must put up a fight My love, I'd give my life just to see you smile And it's always been that way. I stood by him like a lioness. Like a samurai his master day and without a break It was that way when we were nobody, when we had to play in circuses or theaters... And it was that way when we became famous. When we got really good. When we started When everybody recognized us in every street every city. It's always been that way. And you want us to talk things over? What is there about? What could he possibly tell me? He can't say anything to me. Without me, he's nothing. And no he's gone. If I don't want him gone, He won't go anywhere. He's got nowhere to go. He can't leave. And tonight the rain falls like a shadow over our love It seals our fate like an oath, like a prayer And who knows if life will give us fortune or misery Give me your hand, my love, it's just you and I I'm tired. Would you like a cup of tea? Maybe a scotch? Go home. No, it's early. Don't you want me to stay? No, really. I'm going to take a shower. Enough for today. You're a good person. Don't cry. Salaam Alaikum. I can't take it anymore. I can't stand her any longer. It's been too many years. Too many years of abuse, arrogance, tyranny... She thinks the world revolves around her. He hates him because he split. Why wouldn't he? Can you imagine being with her every single day? Imagine that. She's like Medusa. It's like being married to Medusa. I spoke to him. At least, he's reasonable. He's willing to cooperate. If it were up to him, they'd record together. They must record together, you know? They've always recorded together! It's all they know! This invention will never work! It's madness! She's bound by a contract! A contract! She's not a free woman, you understand? She has to do as I say, not the other way round! She's a heartless bitch. I invented her. I did it. I invented her. He can't say no to me. She can't say no to me, and east of all to this! - Frank... - She can't, you hear? Speak. What is she going to do? What is she up to? Is she willing to record with him or not? Speak. You're not speaking. You're not speaking. You're on her side. Are you defending her? Another betrayal. Frank... You have to understand that I work for her now. Thanks to who? Who put you there? Thanks to whom, Flavia? Frank... Tanks to whom? Thanks to me! Thanks to me, Flavia! Am I wrong? Do you want me to remind you? Frank... What's going on with Victoria? You prefer her. You forgot about me and now you prefer her. Frank, stop it. What's with you and Victoria? Tell me! Nothing. Nothing's going on. But you took her side. You're defending her. You're in cahoots! You're plotting against me! You forgot about me. You've completely forgotten about me. Frank, we said wouldn't talk about that. You promised. Left the apartment. That apartment was for you, Flavia. Yes, Frank, I left. When are you coming back? You're not coming back. No. You're not coming back. Not anytime soon. Where are you staying? Frank... Where are you staying? In a hotel. Which hotel? It doesn't matter. In some hotel. Which hotel? Stop it, Frank. You're back to your old ways aren't you? Where did you get that? You're back to your old ways. You're hanging out with those people again. No. I swear, Frank. You're wrong about that. And what about the other thing? What thing? That you're messing with that again. Victoria. You and Victoria are up to something. Stop it, Frank. I'm leaving. Do you want me to remind you where you were when we met? Go away. Now. Flavia. What? Kiss me. Cut it out, rank. Kiss me, Flavia. No, Frank, stop it. Go away now. Only if you kiss me. We said we wouldn't, Frank. I'll leave only if you kiss me. What are you doing here? Surprise. What are you doing here? Who's that? A new boyfriend? How did you find me? I followed you. I've been following you for 5 days. Been to that singer's place and everything. What do you want? Go away. Not yet. Marcos, I'm already out. I'm out of the game. I don't have anything to do with the group. I haven't seen them in almost a year. I have a new job, a new life. Good for you. All of that is in the past, I swear. That's not what I heard. What? Are you sure it's all in the past? What do you mean? Don't be coy, I told you I've been following you. So? Is it true? - What do you want to know? - If it's true or not. I don't know what you're talking a out, Marcos. Go away. It is true. You got a centurion. - You're crazy. - Did you get a centurion? You're crazy. You know very well that they're extinct. The last specimens died... Don't take me for a fool. I've been parroting that story for 10 years. Where are you keeping it? Stop, Marcos. Where is the centurion? Is it at the motel? Stop looking for it. What did you do? Stop looking for it, Marcos. It's no use to you anymore. What? You heard me. It's no use to you anymore. You injected yourself the toxin? I can't believe it. You injected yourself the toxin. How long ago? Marcos, I'll say it again. I'm out. Tell the group I'm out. What is it? Nothing. I'm not with the group either. I also have a new job. Speak. Speak. Isabella. You're lying. She is in Milan. Everybody knows that. She's here now. She arrived 5 months ago. Where? Patience. What do you want? We've been working a lot. We've made a lot of progress. There's a new guy. You'll meet him soon. It has nothing to do with the group. Nobody wants to have anything to do with them. This is for real. What do they want from me? The centurion won't produce the toxin in another 6 months. It's no use for them now. How long as it been in your bloodstream? 3 days. The same day you followed me. Send a blood sample to this address. Are you willing to cooperate? It's Isabella. Nobody says no to Isabella. Where is she? Where? She's changed. You wouldn't recognize her. Does she know about Victoria? Does she know I'm working? She knows everything. Take me to her. Now. THE STARS Let's traverse the galaxy hand in hand Without past, without future, without day or night I want to leave my life in Earth behind Let's go get lost in some other planet Let's watch the Sun hide behind the Saturno I want to do all of that with you and much more Somewhere deep in space I want to float by your side I want to feel joy and bliss The North Star will watch us fly by And will wave to us when she sees us glow And the Ursa Major will see our love And will also sing this song Imagine, my love, this beautiful fantasy The cosmos is a garden full of glee and delight The Milky Way awash with color The stars will glow bright as if they were daisies I want to sing with you thousands of songs Before an audience made of constellations Befriend a shooting star And tell her in secret how happy you make me Somewhere deep in space I want to float by your side I want to feel joy and bliss The Northern Star will watch us fly by And will wave to us when she sees us glow And the Ursa Major will see our love And will also sing this song Somewhere deep in space I want to float by your side I want to feel joy and bliss The Northern Star ill watch us fly by And will wave to us when she sees us glow And the Ursa Major will see our love And will also sing this song LIKE THE IVY You are like my shadow Whatever I do, you follow me around And when the sun goes down you'll disappear You're the fool that the King lends his crown to Just yo watch people stare and laugh at him. You're a painting forgotten in the back of a dollar store That someday a bad painter copied from a work of art Just a counterfeit Just a parasite, a bird of prey Just a beggar picking up what others leave behind You're like ivy to me You drink my sap just to cling to life You may cover some wall But you'll never bloom You've always wanted to be more like me To take my place and make a name for yourself But all your ambition has gotten you Was to live in this song just for a while Is that her? Good. At last, we're all here... I would like to make the introductions, since many of you are meeting each other for the first time. Mr. and Mrs. Malpensa, from Milan. Mr. Rubinstein. Reverend Willis. Professor Mauricio Garcia, whom I've been telling you about for weeks. And, lastly, Flavia, the rare piece in our collection. I believe everybody has met Marcos. I don't have much more to say. I would like to thank you all for being here... and assure that I am very proud of hose sitting at this table. In conclusion, I would like to tell you that, undoubtedly, today's meeting... will be a turning point for everybody here... Will be a turning point for everybody here... of tomorrow and forever. The rest will be explained by professor Garcia. He needs no introduction. Suffice it to say, he's one of the top 5 leading researchers in the world... in animal toxins. I can assure you we're in very good hands. Well, I am very humbled by our friend's introduction. I hope it's not a problem if I speak in Spanish. I think that... Speak Spanish. Fine. First of all, I'd like to say that I'm very surprised... by the results of your research. It's been almost 10 years... since I've been researching scorpion toxins, and I wouldn't have reached these conclusions... if I hadn't crossed paths with Isabella and all of you. As you all know, what is commonly known as "science".. Is mostly a conservative, fearful and short-sighted discipline. That's why it's stimulating to come across people... that are willing to take risks outside the realm of science... and willing to go through extraordinary experiences. But let's cut to the chase. According to what Isabella told me, most of you know or have tried the D1-metatoxin. All of you are aware.. Of the consequences D1 has on our bodies and blood. This, gentlemen, is the D2-metatoxin. I can assure you... that this is to our experiences... what the appearance of Wolfgang Amadeus Mo art... was to the story of music. That's music to my ears. But most importantly, what could really revolutionize everything we know so far... and make our lives change forever, as Isabella said, are not the immediate consequences of the substance... you're holding right now and will try in a few minutes. What is really important here is that D2 is the key. Let me explain. The D2 is a compound... made with the toxins of highly venomous species... of middle or large range, basically, Centuroides and Buthus. Its formula has a distinctive feature: it admits species of the same toxicity level, but of a lesser range. Sure, you may think, "So what? "The lesser range species no longer exist." But you would be wrong. That's when the specimen... of the lowest range known to us pops up: the Leiurus centurionis, the legendary centurion scorpion. And that's when she makes her appearance, Flavia. If we're able to introduce... the toxin of the centurion scorpion into D2, we would be speaking... not only of the known psychophysical consequences, but of cellular regeneration, or even autonomous cellular regeneration. The goal set by Science from its very beginning, and that quackery we call "science" today... has forgotten about: eternal youth. May I ask you a question, doctor? Yes. Please. Can we see a specimen of the scorpion? Flavia has the specimen in her custody. And how do we know it's still producing the toxin? Well the specimen is momentarily in its regeneration stage. It won't produce the toxin for another months. The toxin is here. The toxin is here! Fermenting in her blood! It's in her bloodstream! Active for 3 months! 2 more months than the scorpion! Enough time until the Leirus starts producing it again! In 5 months, you'll have your centurion toxin ready! This woman is our scorpion. Any questions? In that case, it's time to begin. It's getting late. Me too? Yes. Not you. Why? Is there something wrong. Yes. Something serious? Very serious. I want to be your joy Your princess, your company I want to be your solace To take flight with you Stop, stop. What? Is it imperative to do that modulation? What modulation? "To take flight with you..." What's the problem? He problem is you are no doing it correctly. You are dragging the words. The song is simple... and you're dragging the words unnecessarily. Okay. I won't "drag the words." I want to be your joy Your princess, your company I want to be your solace To take flight with you I want to be your smile Your lover, your Mona Lisa Now what? Is there any way or you to sing it higher? An octave higher. Are you serious? I sing low. I always have. What are you talking about? I was wondering... if it wouldn't be better you sang an octave higher. That's it, just wondering. I don't know. Get yourself another singer. I was just wondering! Just wondering! Can you play the piano? I want to be your joy Your princess, your company I want to be your solace To take flight with you I want to be your smile Your lover, your Mona Lisa And I want you to leave your pain behind I want to be your peace No, no! "I want to be your peace" I don't get it. I really don't know why you insist on... What? What is it? What is it? What you are telling me is you want me to sing it like her. Is that it? Don't be ridiculous. I don't kid myself. I wasn't born yesterday. I know very well how things are. I know that, if this was a story, I wouldn't be the heroine. I wouldn't even be the enemy of the heroine. I wouldn't scare anyone. No one would care about me. They would think of me... as something functional for the plot, like some sort of engine that no one really cares about. I don't kid myself. I wasn't born yesterday. Even you think that. You, who picked me. You, who picked me sparked this whole story. This whole storm. You don't know who I am. No one knows who I am. No one knows me. Neither do you. You don't know me. I am Andrea Nigro. Andrea Nigro. Do you have something to say? Aren't you going to say anything? Talk. It's not easy. It was never easy to get away from her. To get her out of your life. I don't know anybody who could To turn the page... and at least buy the fiction that life can go on without her. That there are other things beyond. No. She makes sure you see it's not possible. That there's nothing else. The first time I wanted to leave her, do you know what happened? I was at a hotel, one of those flophouses... here we spent our life back then. Small town fleabag hotel, by the square. Outside, it was pouring rain. I think back then... thought of love as a battle, as a war. A game where necessarily one had to win, and the other lost. And I was the one who always lost. Time after time I lost. I played my cards with such ineptitude, one could beat me. Even a poor 17-year-old girl could beat me, who only knew the haggard landscape... I had shown her. Even she could beat me. Even she was going to beat me. But I was determined never to lose again. I remember looking over the hotel window: the square, in the middle of the rain, and a couple that as running hand in hand, covering up with a jacket so they wouldn't get wet. And I thought: "They are not enemies. They are together. "For them, no one wins, no one loses. "There is no war, no danger." An I remember looking er while she slept... and thinking she was my enemy. And I said to myself: "I'm not going to lose again. "Before I lose, I will disappear. "I'll leave, any time. "It's me who'll leave." It was raining It was the darkest night Not even a star Not even the moon It was raining My life already empty Suddenly found something It found your eyes And so? Came the famous night, the night of the rain. Talk. It was that same night, the same day of the hotel, the rain and the couple running. That afternoon, I had felt brave. I had seen things clearly. And for a moment, I had been happy. Now, I was cornered by the rain, like a rat. She was also there. And there was nothing I could do. Was then that I realized she had defeated me. That I had lost once more, and I had lost for good. And so yes, I gave up. I bowed my head and surrendered. You were a carrier pigeon You made me look up And look outside Thank you My voice is drowned by tears My desperate voice Found its song in you The strangest thing of all... is that, from that moment on, I started to feel good, I started being happy. From that very moment. From the moment I understood I had lost the war. I thought: "Maybe that is my destiny, to lose the war." I spent years fighting against that, escaping that. And now, that found me. "I already lost, I'm at peace." And right there I began my life. A docile life, a prisoner's life. Docile, obedient, humiliating. Almost ideal. Come on, we've a long way to go And a new day Might find us together You were a carrier pigeon You made raise my eyes And look outside Until I came your way. And made you rebel. And I helped you escape. And you were free. And you were unhappy again. And miserable. Yes or no? Yes. And tonight the rain falls like a shadow over our love It seals our fate like an oath, like a prayer And who knows if life will give us fortune or misery Give me your hand, my love, there is only you and me Who is it? It's me. What are you looking for? You. Come in. Thank you. So? Can I smoke here? Smoke. In my family, we are 4 sisters. I am the youngest. When I was little, my eldest sister was some sort of queen. She was strong, smug, had these blazing eyes... She didn't look anything like my parents. She seemed to be the daughter of some ancient king. Alexander the Great's. Or some Persian or Indian king's. She sang. Same as me. By the way she sang, everyone said... she was going to be one of the biggest stars in the world. After studying for a few months, all the best coaches were already fighting for her. By the time she was 15, she was living in London... and was offered million-dollar deals. My second sister didn't sing, but she was brilliant. She was tall and blonde. By 13, she had finished high school, she was teaching people a lot older than her, and she exchanged letters... with scientists from around the globe. My third sister was, on top of brilliant, beautiful. She was always beautiful. Since she was born, since the first day. When she grew up and became a woman, no girl was a rival for her. There was no man who wasn't in love with her. She only had to show up... for the other women to become invisible, to become a bunch of insignificant ants. And then there was me. Today, all I know from my eldest sister... is that she's living somewhere in Central America. And she works at a bank, I think. You can imagine, she doesn't sing. My second sister teaches Physic in a couple of schools. She's single, I think for good. My third sister married when she was 19. Nowadays, she's married to a salesman and lives in some rural town. She had 5 kids, and some years ago she came to weigh 200 pounds. And then there's me. What am I trying to say by this? I'm trying to tell you I'm not brilliant. Nor am I too talented. Nor too beautiful. I'm not even sure I'm a good singer. But I know how to survive. I've learn to survive. My destiny is to survive. And I'm very good at that. I want to tell you it's not easy. It's not easy at all to get rid of me. Do you want one? Yes. So if this whole situation, I want to tell you I'm not afraid. Not only am I not afraid, I am willing. I can't wait for it to happen. Do you want to go back? Then go back. We'll see how you I wish you good luck. But let me tell you: I'll also be there. Is that a dare? You could say so. A duel? Yes. Okay. In a week. There. Okay. I'll tell him. I'll handle it. As you wish. I'll handle it. Thank you for everything. Will you let me out? Someone will. I came as soon as I could. Did something happen? Calm down. Why did you call me? What happened? - Calm down. - I'm calm, what happened? Calm down. I am calm. Where is Isabella? Is she okay? Calm down. Where is Isabella? Marcos, where is Isabella? Calm down. Marcos! What's going on? Look over there. What? Don't you see anything? Yes, a boat. Look at that boat. - Is Isabella on that boat? - Take a good look. Is Isabella on that boat? Marcos, is she okay? Calm down... What is this? Calm down. Let me go, what's going on? Calm down, it's okay. Let me go. I can't let you go. Calm down. We simply want to ask you a few questions. What questions? What's going on? We can't let you go. We have a couple of questions to ask you. I promise you, once you answer our questions, we'll let you go. Let me go now. What questions? What's going on? We have a couple of problems with your blood tests. What? What's wrong? The blood tests show the toxin is not active in your blood. You have injected it 3 weeks ago, it should already be on the bloodstream. You saw the people at the manor the other day. It's needless to how important it is... for your toxin to be active. So what's going, then? Calm down. A toxin as powerful as the centurion's... can't remain inactive in a body, unless it's being rejected for some reason. Your blood results are normal. So what's the problem? Please... suspect there is a psychological factor involved. Flavia, we need to know if there's something, right now, that might be affecting you. Let me go. Flavia, we are going to let you go but it's very important that you think... What are you talking about? Flavia, calm down. I don't know anything. We need to know if there's something, anything, that might be affecting you. I don't know anything. Let me go. Flavia... Flavia, calm down. Calm down... Let me go. Flavia, calm down. I don't know what you're talking about. Calm down. Flavia, calm down. It's okay, calm down. Flavia. Flavia. Can you hear me? Flavia? Flavia? Now you will answer all the questions I'll ask, okay? Flavia, listen to me. Now you will answer, do you understand? Yes. Flavia, I need you to answer. Flavia, I need to know... if there's something troubling you. Flavia, I need to know... if there's something that's upsetting you. Flavia, something upsetting. Flavia, I need to know. I need to know if there is something upsetting you. What is troubling you, Flavia? What is troubling you? What is troubling you, Flavia? She. Who? Who's she? Who's she, Flavia? She. Flavia, I need you to tell me who she is. What is it that worries you about her? That they harm her. Who can harm her? Who can harm her, Flavia? He. How can he harm her? How can he harm her, Flavia? On the boat. On the boat? On the boat She's on the boat. What boat? Flavia, can you tell us the name of the boat? On a boat. A boat that is anchored at the port. He has her there. Wait, I think she's talking about something I said... before bringing her in. She's confused. What's happening on the boat? It's raining. It's raining hard. She's mixing everything up. And what's he doing on the boat He's leaving. He's leaving on the boat. She's confused. A wretched man. He has nowhere to go. He can't leave, he has nowhere to go. Is he leaving or not? No. He's not. He can't go. So? So what? So what happens? I don't know. This is preposterous. There's no boat, she's raving. Let's see, let's try again. Flavia, are they together now? No. And now that they are not together, is she alright? Yes. And when they were together, she was not well. Right. And you are afraid that, if they get back together, she will be unwell again. Exactly. They're not getting back together. No. Are you sure? I'm sure. I'm sure they are not. I'm sure. Son of a bitch. Son of a fucking bitch. Son of a bitch. Go to hell, fucking son of a bitch! Son of a bitch! Go to hell, fucking son of a bitch! Son of a bitch! Son of a fucking bitch! That's enough. Put her to sleep. Erase all memory of this. Go to hell, fucking son of a bitch! Go to hell, fucking son of a bitch! Son of a bitch! Go to hell, fucking son of a bitch! Son of a bitch! Son of a bitch! Go to hell, fucking son of a bitch! Son of a bitch! Go to hell, fucking son of a bitch! Find out. I AM THE FIRE Can you play the bass line for me? Come on. Mids are a bit high, right? Yes, add some... Is it okay? - Add more bass. - Okay. - Slap? - What? - Are you going to slap? - I don't do slap. I'm searching for you. There, I'm getting some reverb. Check your amplifier, guitar. Are you going to try that pedal? She should've been here an hour ago. Call her, see where she's a Can you adjust that? I don't like how it sounds. Adjust that. I think it's terribly disrespectful. Hello. Hello. Hey, sweetie. Ow are you, Nigro? Carlitos. Be a doll, bring me some ice. Hold this for me. Get out. Stop, let's do one thing. You're going to play the first beats without the bass drum. Then, for the chorus, you'll add the hi-hat. That's right. Know the lyrics, don't you? Es, I know the lyrics. Start recording. I'm the fire stalking you That will soon turn your damned soul into ashes I'm the poisoned arrowhead aimed at your heart I'm your menace, your ordeal I'm silently looking for you in the dark of the night I'm madness, I'm the fuse The bomb about to go off that it's too late to disarm I am the dagger If you pull me out of your chest Nothing will be left the hatred, I'm Hell I'm the messenger carrying your eternal punishment I am the winter that makes your inner spring wither I am the storm, the beast The panther that slowly creeps up on you I'm the one counting the days Until see you kneeling before me I am Death I've always lived in you and you've never realized it One day you made me cry No One day you broke my heart No I'm going after you and I won't stop Until we're face to face No more You didn't know what love was I know it But by force you shall understand Have mercy That my fury, hatred, contempt and spite Are not my worst flaws And what's that? That I don't know how to lose I was the trap, your sentence I was the betraying coyote who howls at the full moon I was the hyena The horrible animal that ate your carrion while laughing The venom Your misery The poison that secretly got into your veins In my sorrow, I know it well I deserve it and now, on my knees, I implore you Do not be afraid And if you still doubt I'm honest Look how I'm crying You make me laugh I don't believe you I know your heart well And that's why I can see that you still love me That in the shadows of your pain there is still a flame If that is true, you are dead And with that flame I will burn your deserted heart You still love me, still have you I use your heart like a puppet To entertain myself Don't you shut it To kill you or to love you I don't know anymore what I come for An though you made me cry Yes And you broke my heart Yes Once again I fall I can't stand not being with you at night Here I am I don't know what love is I do Maybe I will never know it You won't But just to be with you again I have to learn one more thing And what's that? That I don't mind losing I think we're done here. I need to smoke. Do you want me to go? No, you stay, I'll handle it. TO BE CONTINUED
