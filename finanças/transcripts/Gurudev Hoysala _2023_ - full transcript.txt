Even if it is our enemies. We will love them. But if the statue is installed. We will break it down. ALL HAIL KITTUR RANI CHENNAMMA! ALL HAIL SANGOLLI RAYANNA! ALL HAIL KITTUR RANI CHENNAMMA! ALL HAIL SANGOLLI RAYANNA! We will not let the statue be inaugurated. This riot should warn every Kannadiga. This riot isn't doing enough. Make it bigger. It'll help me in the assembly. Okay Dada. Control room?! There's riots all over the City bus stand and City Circle areas. The protesters have startled hurling petrol bombs. They're attacking the police. The situation's gone out of hand. The public's under duress. Send a higher official at the earliest. In Karnataka, we love and respect all languages. We hoist the Karnataka flag and celebrate heroes like Sangolli Ramayana. We take pride in Kannada and its roots. Nobody can stop that from happening.

Being the Commissioner, I'm not able to digest this news, Gurudev. Sub-Inspector Bhargav is nowhere to be seen. He's missing. Sir, was he part of any undercover operation? Yes. If the news gets out, the police department will lose its respect. Not like the public respects us anyway. About this missing case... I'll investigate it, Sir. I'll have to move to Athani, right? Only a postman is scared of getting transferred. Not a policeman. Good luck. Thank you, Sir. Sarika, answer the call. Hello? Dev? Where are you? Ay! Give me the phone. Ganga, I'm heading to Athani. I've been transferred. Really? Yes. You pack and get here. Dev Sir has been transferred. This will be your last class. Every time you get transferred, I hardly use the clothes at the top of the suitcase. The rest of them remain packed. Isn't that good? You don't need to pack them again. Yep. One shouldn't marry a cop. Once married, we shouldn't complain. I realised. God's ways are weird. Don't you think so Kamalamma? Why do you say that? God frees these beans, but why does he refuse to free me? Him and his trash talk, moron! Let that be. Is this for the salad or the curry? For the curry man. My wife has eloped, Sir. I'd to lodge a complaint. Isn't that a good thing? Why lodge a complaint? Give us a party instead. But.. Sir... Wait man! The new officer's here. My name's Sharief. Welcome, Sir. The station is under repair, Kindly co-operate, Sir. Let me introduce you to the staff. Sir, this is Kamalamma. Our station's Head Constable. Is this a Police station or a college canteen? Sir, the thing is... All the guns are jammed. None of them are in the working condition. Who's he? Sir, he's a bigtime crook! Doesn't look like one. And he's made that his USP. I am a thief, Sir. But not by choice. This cruel society pushed me into thieving. Even though he's a thief, his ethics are in place. He's a thief with integrity. What sort of integrity? If he runs, you'll lose your job. Sir! I'd liked a girl, Sir. I didn't elope when she wanted me to. You think I'll run now? Sir... Not just the station, you people need to be repaired too. Call in the SHO. Sure, Sir. Sir, the new officer is here. So?! So what now? Hurry up. He wants to see you. My WhatsApp has a new DP. Show him. I'll come by later. Is that so? Okay, Sir. You ding-bat! You're the dunderhead who went to visit his bride, and instead married his in-law in a hurry. Sir? I didn't get you. Both of you are rookies. Salute him and make him sit. I'll be there. Okay, Sir. Sir, My name's Sampath. I'm the senior-most officer here. Not just a thorough professional, but also a friendly police officer. Police shouldn't make either friends or enemies. Rightly said, Sir. Any information on SI Bhargav? He was a good officer, Sir. He was the type that would seek trouble unnecessarily. Uniforms tend to get dirty. He would do everything covertly. Fearing that information would get breached, he wouldn't even take the driver. His phone was last tracked at Boodihalli of Thogati cross. After which both him and his signal went missing. Even his family has no clue about his whereabouts. I need all the updates on the case from now. - Okay. I need all the details of the cases Bhargav handled. - Sure. Call for all the criminals in our station limits. Okay. Neelakanta, come along. I need a helper to set-up the house. Sir, Mala and I will come by. It's not right to use the station staff for personal errands. You there! Get in. Me? Bye! Take care! Ganga, I'm on my way. Sir, he took the crook home. Let him suffer. Attige, where do I put this? Who are you? Sir got me. Where's he? He's on a call. Attige, you're Sir's wife after all. But why do you dress up like a homeless? Shame. Come here. Not like I don't own anything. I wear this only when I go out. Woah! A coin necklace. A Gokak temple jewellery design. Calculating weight post the wastage. This should weigh 85 grams. Am I right? Let me see? A two-threaded chain! An Anjali cut design. 35 grams. How did you guess so perfectly? This is my trade after all. I'll show you my mother's chain. Want to see? A flattened medal chain. Madam, our ancestors knew their business. Right? Gold should weigh its worth. 85 grams? This? Nagavalli Jhumki? She really is Ganga. Well, a bracelet. That's an Uri chain. Let me guess. 15-20 grams? You're good. Gold on this man. I'm the Golden man! Bracelet on hands that need to be handcuffed, huh?! He's a thief?! Can't believe that at all! Check if everything's in place and lock them up. Let's go out for dinner. Once we're back, this thief will set-up the house. Without patients, doctors are useless. Without criminals, lawyers are useless. Without us, you're of no use, Sir. You're supposed to reform him. How will he, if you keep calling him a thief? Let's do this. Why don't we name him something? I'm a thief but not an orphan. I've a name. You can address me by it. Naga! Ganga, let's go. You also come along. Look at his consideration for you. This is not consideration. Suspicion. If we take him along, I'll be losing some money. If I leave him here, I'll have to lose all the gold. Where will you find a cop who doesn't suspect? Let's go. Ganga? Ganga! Good Morning, Sir! Ay! Give the phone to Ganga. Attige, it's your husband on call. Hello? Why did you give him the phone? I didn't. The phone was in the purse and the purse is with him. Have you ever got me to the market? He's such a good negotiator, you know? He'll be ruining my reputation. No need to do favours because Inspector's wife or brother is here. Two kilos of everything will do. Okay, Sir. What time do the vegetables reach the market? - 5 A.M. sir. Make sure you drop them home first and then carry on with your day. Stop weighing. Not like you'll lose much. I'll see you. Sure. Who's here? The vendor's out. I'm taking the fruits. Add them to Sir's account. Sir? Who? I need to produce him to the court. Bring him. Okay. Attige, give me the phone. Let me keep it inside. Did you get everything? Yes. Shall we go? Let's go. Okay. What has the world come to? When the hungry grab things, we're called thieves. When the affluent do the same, it's called duty. Naga, let's go. Coming. Sir, he never discussed much about work. There are some investigation related files. Where are they? Over there. Yes, Gurudev? There are a lot of loose ends in the Bhargav missing case. It'll take a while to trace everything. Okay. Keep me posted. Yes, Sir. Sand mafia continues its stride. Grave incompetence of the local administration and police continues to aid the mafia. Are politicians also involved in the illegal sand mining racket? Rumors among the public are rife that the police are botching the investigations to protect the politicians. Sir, join us! Harisha, mix some water with the booze! Sir, I'm very impressed with you. An Inspector should be like you. No matter what you do, you concubine the staff... O! He doesn't concubine us, Sharief. He combines us, you dumbo! Sir, mistakes are common when one's drunk. Why pick on that? Sir, I've seen a lot of officers. They don't even buy us a cup of tea. Look at you giving us a party. Did your former officer have such get-together? No way! Never! Even if we drank with our own money and came to work. He would file a report against us. He's reported against Sharief way too many times. Tell him about it. Why talk about him on a good day like this? A pan fry for us. A cop should either get someone drunk or beat the shit out them to get them talking. He wouldn't do either. Tell me about the legal and illegal activities taking place in our jurisdiction. The illegal activities have been legalised here. Sand mafia gets to work at this hour. While we're dunking booze, they'll be dunking sand into their trucks. The media gets hold of this matter and screws us all day. Interesting. Let's raid them now. How do we do our duty when drunk? One shouldn't drink while on duty. Neither should we forget our duty because we're drunk. Let's go. But sir, why get into this now? Let's go. Sir, why did you ask us come at this hour? 'Illegal sand mining mafia within the Police station's earshot' 'Irresponsible police department stay mum over the issue' You guys scream it 24x7, don't you? Let me show you what real cops do. Is this how you talk to the media? Journalism isn't holding a Mic and blabbering. You should be well informed. Your intentions and conscience should be pure. Sir, shoot them down! Go take cover! We now have the mastermind of this operation. The man who's known as Hoysala in the police department, Gurudev. Tell me, Sir. How was this operation planned? The vehicles have been seized. Culprits have been taken into custody. The owners need to meet me with their documents and tender papers. Come over and there'll be an inquiry. If you make me come over, there's be a funeral. What a chance, Sir! Let's go and talk to the media. Why get into that mess? We get our monthly payments. You want me to lose it just to appear on TV? Learn to be a fly on the wall. BREAKING NEWS! HOYSALA RAMS & BATTERS! SAND MAFIA IN TATTERS! There you go. The owners need to meet me with their documents and tender papers. Come over and there'll be an inquiry. If you make me come over, there's be a funeral. Tell me, Sir? Who is this new officer? His name's Hoysala. The new appointee in the place of Bhargava. You should've told him about us. He's done it all by himself. He's extremely brave. He can't be stomped or stopped. He sure is the public's favourite. But one can't judge if he's a good man or not. Plus this is a new station for him. Ay! The station might be new for him. But it's not new to us. If it's a loyal dog, we'll feed it. If it tries to bite us... You've managed to tame someone like me. It won't be a big task for you to tame a rookie. He's on leave. I'll call you once he's back. Meanwhile, send the vehicle documents and tender papers. I'll see you. Look here. Sir has come. Don't just look. Throw in 500 bucks. There's hardly any business. Fine. Give me 200 bucks. Why do you trouble me, Sir? Someone's raising their voice, eh? Thought I'll let a poor man open his shop until 10 P.M. But you go on until 2 A.M. Shell out man! Here's 500 for today and tomorrow! Pack two plates of egg rice. I'll be back. What's up, Chunky? Heard your back at your old ways. What is it now? Here you go. Who all are in the rooms? It's all in the register. See for yourself. So anybody can book another person and walk-in. And entering it in the book, makes it legal? The couple that walked in. Where are they staying? Room No. 305. Do what you want. But don't disturb the other customers. Sir's asking for you. Come. Why should I? Ay! Just come, brother. My my! I don't see a ring to assume you're engaged. Neither do I see a toe ring to assume you're married. Nor do I see a Rakhi to assume you're siblings. To top it all, you're staying in a lodge like this. Walk. Now. But Sir...? Pay up! A fine of 10,000. But why should we? Why is this woman pulling a tax resistance protest? Sir, we don't have all that money. Fine. Get in the jeep now. Shall I give them the chain? No, don't. I feel pity for you. Pay 5,000 and I'll let you go. I'm telling you. We don't have that much money. If you don't have the cash, why are you out with a girl? Drive to the station. Sir, please don't do this. Why trouble them? Take what they have and send them away. Consider this a corona discount. Else we wouldn't be letting you go. Give me the cash. Sir, it's three hundred bucks! You think you're offering alms to the poor? Make them sit inside. Get inside! Sir, please let us go. Please let us go. You did this to yourself. DON'T FEAR THE POLICE. TRUST THEM. Good Morning, Sir. Morning, Sir. Who's that Mala? Sampath sir got them here claiming that they were suspiciously walking around the Swarga lodge. Get them here. Yes, Sir. Sir... What's your story? A love story? Where are you from? Sir, I'm Ravi. She's Bhoomi. We're from Ambewadi. I used to work in a departmental store. She stayed in the PG opposite the store. We became friends and eventually fell in love. We'd registered to get married in the mass marriage program arranged by the MLA. Here's the application. Did you elope fearing your elders? We're orphans, Sir. A rose and a smile, you'll fall in love. Two garlands and a taaLi, you're married. But marriage isn't a cakewalk. It takes a list of things, just like it does in a departmental store. You would know. We do. We love each other and wish to be married. Mala, make some calls and verify if their claims are true. Sure, Sir. But tell me this... You came to get married, but what did you do to get here? Sampath Sir suspected us for no good reason and got us here. He began to demand for money. We don't have that much money. Sampath?! Yes, Sir? Why did you make them stay the night here? They were up to something immoral at the hotel room. I caught them red-handed. You're clearly ignorant about the law. Even if you raid brothel houses and lodges, you can't arrest sex workers. You've made them stay all night in the station. If they complain, you'll lose your job. Why did you ask for money? The public derides us by calling us Maama already. Who said so?! I didn't take any money. You were with me. Tell him. If you're the disgusting drool, he's the phlegm. If a boy and a girl are together, don't assume that they're up to some business. If you can't support lovers, don't report them for nothing. Remember that the cops also have wives and kids. Sorry, Sir. Sir, I made the calls. The boy's speaking he truth. Since you brought them to the station, they missed out on the mass marriage event. Call a photographer and a priest. You take the initiative and get them married at your own expense. But how can I spend my money...? Consider this as repentance for your sin. Go on now. Okay, Sir. Sit down. Shall I call for the caterer too? Why not? Let me help them consummate and cradle their baby too! Happy Married life. Thank you, Sir. Get in. Drop them to the bus stand. Okay, Sir. BEEP Cheers to everyone! Bastard! Get out here! Hey dumb-ass! Come out! Relax. Stay in here. Don't come out. The one who walks in with a mob is the bastard! Not the one who faces you alone. Will you silently walk out...? Or should I shoot? How many will you shoot? The bullets in your gun won't suffice for the number of people here. Doesn't matter how many bullets are in here. What matters is, how many of you will face it. You've been asked to do your cop duty, quit being a broker, you loafer! This department is filled with brokers and bone-breakers. I'm sure you know who I am by now. Shoot! Gurudev! What's your native, Sir? Arasikere. You left your village and walked into hell. I know my way around both the village and hell. You'll feel the heat soon. Let me talk. A family event is going on. Whatever it is, come by office tomorrow. I'll call Gurudev too and we'll sort it out. Give him an introduction about us, Sir. Introduce me to them too, Sir. If they still try to mess around, they won't be around any more. He tends to get up everyone's nose with his words. Ask him to shut all his senses and stick to his duties, before he loses them all. Instead of putting handcuffs on the criminals, he's out with couples, helping them exchange rings. Do you know who she is? She's my daughter For the last few days, we've been running around looking for her with her picture. Instead, we ended up finding her wedding photo. We got lucky that the photographs fell in my hand. If it hadn't, my reputation in my village would've bit the dust. What's your issue now? He's helped a penniless shithead to tie the knots with her. Having a puny college degree doesn't turn a cobbler into a noble lord. What's this Gurudev? They claimed that they were orphans. Moreover, they're adults. I got them married because they consented it. Who the heck are you to get my girl married? The guy claimed to be an orphan. His mother must be pretty close to him. Watch your mouth, you son of a whore! Else I'll shoot you... Watch yourself! Else you won't be returning tonight. Come on then! Gurudev! Let me go, Sir. Gurudev, mind your tongue! What was that language? Being a senior officer, you respect me. Who the heck are they to disrespect me?! I'll rain hellfire on their landing strips! Not again! Listen, you made a mistake. Sir, I didn't forcibly marry them. They were adults and consented to it. They lied that they were orphans. This isn't a petty matter. This will turn communal soon. Sensitive matters don't get resolved with more chaos. Try to understand. Was I wrong for getting two lovers married? You weren't wrong for getting lovers married. You were wrong to have gotten two people of different caste and social status married to each other. It matters to the girl's family. That's their personal problem. Exactly. I'm telling you the same thing. We shouldn't meddle in their personal matters. It's okay. If you know where the boy and girl are, call them. Let's talk it out and send the girl with them. I don't know, Sir. Fine. You leave. I'll handle this. Just move! Sir, we've made a mistake. I understand the pain of a father. Give me a couple of days. I'll find your daughter and hand her over to you. How dare he talk to me like that! Like I told you. He's temperamental. You wouldn't want to witness my men's temper. Ask him to stay in his limits. Time to teach him that chilli powder feels different in your mouth and in your eyes. If we break his bones, he'll either end up in the hospital or in hell. Instead, break his peace of mind. Neither should he be able to go to a hospital, nor run for hell. Brother, we didn't find anyone. Oh! Don't worry. We were looking for someone else. I'll see you around. Dance away guys! My dirty shoes entering your personal space seems to be bothering you. Your husband has barged into our territory. Imagine how we feel! Stop the vehicle! This is merely a warning! Make sure you carefully drop madam home. We used to tie our guard dogs to the front door. We used to leave our slippers outside the door. Laborers would wait out in the yard. Our place and dignity was in tact. The day we let the dogs on our couches. The day we walked indoors with our slippers. The day we let the laborers inside our homes. Our place and dignity came under threat. We're the lords of vast areas of land. We're the descendants of ancient clans. If our family messes up, we can reprimand and correct them. But if the entire clan messes up, we can't undo it. We've always been the supreme, the elites and the superiors. We still are and have to continue being so. They've now barged into our homes and taken our girls away. They should continue to remain hungry. All of them who work in our lands, homes and factories should be thrown out of their jobs today. What's wrong, Kaaka? If we fire the workers, won't it be a loss for us. Don't worry about the loss. Whatever the loss is, I'll compensate. Our clan is our God. If our God is disrespected. We're as good as being dead. Sir? Somebody's here to see you. Make them sit inside. There are a lot of people. Sir, my name is Sharanappa. I've been a laborer at the Lord's factory for four decades. He fired me out of the blue. Only if we earn, will our families eat. The responsibilities of our aged parents and spouses lie on us. The Lord has asked us all not to return to work from tomorrow. Ravi is my son, Sir. His mistake is pushing us all to hunger and poverty. They've merely spared our lives. They've troubled us in every possible way. Just because their girl's not home... Their men have started entering our homes at inappropriate times. They've started harassing our girls when they're showering and changing. Our life has turned into a living hell. The lives of us nomads is now caught up in this crossfire. They beat us if we enter the village. They beat us even if we want to leave it. I beg you, Sir. Please do something and find the girl. Do us this favour, please! All of us will forever be grateful to you. What are you thinking? Eat. What's wrong? These men have been troubling me for a while. I thought of telling you but... This is why I didn't. Consider this a sample or an example. Who was the one who danced? Can't believe you got scared of these jackasses! You've been with me for long enough to know better. You know what a monster I can be if I lose my cool. What's up, Officer? You've crossed the borders and entered my home. Both the border, law and order here are all mine. If you wish to hunt a tiger, hunt it down. Instead, you shouldn't go to the tiger's den when it's not around and scratch your itches. Threatening women and families. Throwing them out of their jobs. Emotionally messing with the young and the old. Enough with all this gasholder! If I make up my mind... If you have women to supply you food and booze, I'll claim you're supplying women. If you've men around, I'll claim they're your goons meant to trouble people. If you're smoking weed, I'll claim you supply it too. Without letting you take note, without even serving you a notice, I'll throw you in jail. You need to pay up to understand the law. I get paid, because I know the law. You might be a villain. But there's a villain in me too. Want a taste of him? If this goes in, he'll come out to make an appearance. You won't be able to bear him. Don't get cocky because you're the supreme here. I've locked horns with the superiors and earned their accolades to get here. I'm the Supreme one now. Me and my men don't meddle with others. I want my Bhoomi back. A man in the uniform like you won't understand the attachment and possessiveness of having a daughter. I gave birth to her. I cradled her. The pain of not having her at home is something I wouldn't wish for my worst enemy. I've committed a mistake. I'll ensure I get your daughter back to you. Bhoomi... I'm not just concerned about her. I love her a lot. What if your father gets too happy when Bhoomi returns, and gets her married to the same guy? Even if my father gets a dog, it'll be a pedigree. If it's about a son-in-law, then... But I don't belong to your caste. Friendship doesn't care for caste. Duryodhana trusted Karna enough to give him a piece of his kingdom. I trust you enough to give Bhoomi's hand in marriage to you. How come the serpent has called me today? What's up with the Mongoose? What is it up to? I need all the information. The police are here to scout for information. Look at you scouting for information about the police. I'll send the cash. Sure! There's a guy named Machche in Nehru colony near Ravi's house. He's very close to Ravi. He owns a saloon in the same road. You can find out more if you talk to him. Ravi's number was last traced in the bus stand. After that's it been switched off. Okay. Have you seen either of these people? No, Sir. I've seen them. Where was that? They got on my bus and got off at Chikkodi. Chikkodi? Chikkodi is five hours away from here. The road's a mess. I don't know anything, Sir. He's a piece of work, Sir. The phone number Ravi gave us claiming that it was of his departmental store, belonged to this guy. Speak up. I've been roaming around without food and sleep for the last three days. Please don't hit me. Their story took off during my village's fair. Please come, Dada. Do you expect me to eat with them? That's why I've made them sit on the floor and have arranged tables for you. It's not about the floor or the tables. They aren't worthy enough to sit in front of me and eat. Either ask them to leave or I will. Everybody get up. Quick! Ravi get up! Dada is here! Why should I? Just get up now! Come on! Machche! Dada has asked for you. Coming. Dude, I'll be back soon. So you'll leave everything and go? Am I also not paying you? Can't he come down here and get himself groomed? He has hair in the same spots as I do, doesn't he? Among all the crops bowing down, the corn that stands out, gets snipped off first. ♪ Which caste is inferior among all? O' mad man! ♪ ♪ Which community is superior? ♪ ♪ Life is all about birth and death, why discriminate among human beings? ♪ Ravi was waiting to avenge the insult at the fair. On the day of the college, he humiliated and insulted Dada. Why did you get me this? You've no idea. The moment the song played, he got annoyed and walked away in anger The dance was great. Ajjappa! You too were great. ♪ Which caste is inferior among all? O' mad man! ♪ ♪ Which community is superior? ♪ ♪ Life is all about birth and death, why discriminate among human beings? ♪ Bhoomi visited the hospital to check on Ravi who was admitted. Sorry, Ravi. I heard that my brother and Bali attacked you. Every change needs a leader. I've seen you in college, you have all those qualities. Get well soon. If he hadn't thrashed me, you wouldn't be here. If you hadn't come here, we wouldn't be talking now. Looks like it was all meant for the good. After that, it didn't take long for Ravi and Bhoomi's friendship to turn into love. Did you get the tickets? Superb. Get down. Dude, what about me? Go to her father and... Bhoomi, go sit in the car. A butcher's shop sees a lot of sheep. But a sheep gets to see a butcher's shop only once. Get that in your head and you will live. Or else you'll lose the will to live. Bali found about their love story. Before Dada found out about it, they eloped together. One night, Ravi called me from the bus stand for the last time. Machche, Bhoomi and I got married in the police station. Thank God. All for the good. Dude, how come nobody in the town knows yet? Really? Nobody knows it yet? I did this so that they find out. What are you saying?! Her father spoke highly about his caste and clan. I was waiting to teach him a lesson, Before I could dig him a pit, Bhoomi fell for me. He made us leave our food midway at the fair and now? Here I am. Having my wedding night dinner with his daughter. This is just the beginning. I thought Ravi really loved Bhoomi. But he's just pretending to love Bhoomi, to get back at her father. Ravi and Bhoomi's case is taking a different turn. Bhoomi is not in safe hands. Ravi has loved her just to... Avenge Dada. Speed up the investigation, Gurudev. One wrong turn and towns will burn. In the end, you'll have to take all the blame. Okay, Sir. We've to divide into a team of three and look in every hotel, lodge and PG accommodations. Check with house brokers to find out if somebody new has moved in. You have to scrub the car, gently. Sir! Hello? Ravi escaped from me. Where are you? Since morning, we've combed through Hale bassi, Madanpalya. Now we're at PB-4 Sarala Dhaba for lunch. Disconnect woman! I'll call you later. Sir, we've looked almost everywhere. There's a brothel house in this town. Ravi's intentions are not in the right place. What if he's taken Bhoomi there to...? Shall we look there once? Keep moving! What's wrong, dear?! These two are absconding. If you find anything about them, let us know. These women have been forced into trade. Take action against those responsible. Sure. What grave injustice is this?! I'm having fun with my own money and you're out arresting me. Help me settle. Pass it around! If I get caught, my reputation will be at stake. You'll help me, right? Sir, Naga... Where did you steal this chain? Stealing and me?! This belongs to my mummy, Sir. Look here. B for Bhuvaneshwari. This belongs to no Bhuvaneshwari. It belongs to Bhoomi. I've seen this around her neck. Where did you meet her? I swear I've no idea who she is. I've not met anyone. I stole this from the Marwari's shop. Which store? This one. Who sold you this chain? A thief stole this chain from our shop a couple of days ago. Where did you find this? Sethu, just answer the question being asked. Were they here? This girl wasn't here. But this boy had come to the store. Do you know him? Not really. But he came with Bharath, a guy at the ironing shop. He sold the chain and took the money. Where can I find Bharath? There's a cattle fair today. You can find him there. Give it back to me. Sir, I'm done anyway. Can I go? Fine. I'll inform Sir. You'll find Ravi at the cattle fair. Sampath, you look over there. Sharief, you take this side. Did you get the money? Yes. Here. Where's Bhoomi? I've no clue, Sir. Move, you moron! Let me go! Sir, get up! You think you can mess with the cops?! Let me put you in place! Try me now! Let's do this! Come at me now! Come at me now! Stop this you guys! In this bull fight of yours, he managed to get away! Stop this now! You, leave! Let's go, Sir! Sir, madam's on call. I've been trying to reach you. You're phone's not reachable. Where are you? What's wrong? Mala's with you, right? Ever since I moved, I've spoken more with her than you. You left claiming you're going for two days. You still haven't returned. Couldn't you have informed at the least? My phone's screwed up. The only thing connecting us right now are our phones. Couldn't you inform that it's not working? What's your problem now? Is it that I'm not with you or that I didn't call? Ganga, please understand. You know sensitive the Bhoomi-Ravi issue is, right? I need to find her and bring her home safely. Give me some time. Sir? Just a minute. I'm getting another call. Give it... Hello? Hello Sampath Sir. Please hand the phone over to Sir. Speaking. Tell me. We've found a dead body in Boodihalli cross. It matches with the description you provided. Let's go. Pass the water bottle. Sir... The dead body isn't Bhoomi's. It's someone else. What's happening there? An unidentified girl's body has been found. Carry on. Who are these people? They're a nomadic tribe. ♪ This life isn't all about birth-death ♪ ♪ We shall lead a life of togetherness ♪ ♪ There's more to life! ♪ ♪ There's a lot more to life! ♪ ♪ We shall lead a life of togetherness ♪ ♪ There's more to life! ♪ ♪ There's a lot more to life! ♪ ♪ Adversities and happiness come together ♪ ♪ Why do you cry? ♪ ♪ Why do you laugh? ♪ ♪ Sorrow and joy are different things ♪ ♪ Two different things altogether ♪ ♪ God gifted us a life of goodness and beauty! ♪ ♪ Man however, has whimsically named them ♪ ♪ There's a lot more to humans! ♪ ♪ Don't you bother asking about it ♪ ♪ This life isn't all about birth-death ♪ ♪ We shall lead a life of togetherness ♪ ♪ There's more to life! ♪ ♪ There's a lot more to life! ♪ ♪ We shall lead a life of togetherness ♪ ♪ There's more to life! ♪ ♪ There's a lot more to life! ♪ ♪ While one man laughs ♪ ♪ Another man cries ♪ ♪ That is all life is about, Siva Siva ♪ ♪ Wealth rules over there ♪ ♪ Poverty rules over here ♪ ♪ To hell with money! ♪ ♪ Screw this world! ♪ Kid, listen! Where's Ravi? Sir, is Ravi here? Sir! Do you even know it means to be an orphan? Do you've an idea about their woes? Please don't hit me. People like you should be killed. Please listen to me. Speak up! After I was attacked in college, my professor and Bhargav Sir met me at the hospital. That was the first time I met Bhargav Sir. I know it was Bali and Nana who attacked you. I know the reason behind it too. You are different from them. If you wish to fight, do it legally. I will support you on behalf of law. I wished to avenge Nana and Bali. So, I began to collect information about Nana and Bali's illegal sand mining activities. I handed it over to Bhargav. I informed Bhargav from the spot. If you come right away, you can catch Nana and Bali red-handed. I'm on the way. While I was waiting for them, Bhoomi called. I left from there. Bhoomi, I'm coming. After you got us married in the station, I made another call from the bus stand. This is just the beginning. Bhoomi... Bhoomi? Bhoomi? I heard you on the call with your friend. More than my love that didn't care for our caste... Is the hatred for my father more important? I believe love is bigger than hate. But you're the one who pretended to love me just to avenge and fooled me. Ravi, every girl who loves a man, wishes for him to be like her father. But I loved you only because... You were nothing like my father. His behaviour with you on that day, might have hurt you. But your act with me today, has destroyed my life. Your father's arrogance and belief of being supreme and suppressing others must bite the dust. If the very man he despises, runs away with his daughter...? I should witness the pain, humiliation and sorrow he'll suffer. Ravi, we medical students are taught to treat everyone equally. You clearly haven't understood that basic thought. How will you even understand love? Bhoomi, listen to me! Please! Forgive me, Bhoomi. That was when I understood her love for me. That was it, Sir. After that I got rid of all the hate for her father and made place only for her love in my heart. We left town to live together. When we faced problems, I didn't back out from protecting Bhoomi. We made arrangements to stay hidden from Nana and Bali who were searching for us. After a few days, I'd planned to take my family away. By then... How did you know I was here? From your existence. Where's Bhoomi? Four threes are twelve. Four threes are twelve. Four fours are sixteen. Four fours are... Bhoomi? Shivu, no food for us? Ravi! In your claim of bringing equality to your community, you promised to be their voice and strength. You've made your community lose their food, job and land. If you wish to go to Bali, both of you need to come with me Even if we go to them, my father won't accept our love. He might not accept your love, but he has to accept that the two of you are now married. You need to try and convince him. Instead if you continue to run away, you'll start to loathe your own love for each other. As a brother, I've gotten you both married. I'll convince your family. Trust me and come with me. Okay, Sir. We will. Sampath, give me your phone. Hello? Sir, Gurudev here. I found Bhoomi and Ravi. They're safe. Thank god. As promised, I will handover Bhoomi to her father. That's a great relief. Can't explain it to you, Gurudev. Any way, be careful. Yes, Sir. I'll take care. Sir, give me my phone. I'm at Taanda. Which tent are they in? Sir! What was your price? How much did you sell yourself for?! Being controversial here, will only get me fame. However compromising, will earn me the moolah. How could you bend over just for money?! There are only two kinds of currency. Original and fake currency. There's no such things as loyal and disloyal currency. Look at you shithead getting all philosophical! How are you not ashamed? People like you bring down our department. Sir, the Commissioner's here. Sir, what are you doing here? Gurudev. Handover the couple to me. I'll drop them home. Sir, it's not that easy... They agreed to this only because of me. They trust me. You've rubbed Dadaji the wrong way by getting them married. Things will escalate if you meet him again. So, it's not wise for you to go. I get it. But... This is a sensitive issue. Try to understand. Let's get her home. Things will cool down. Let's convince her father later. Okay, Sir. But I'll keep Bali in my custody until then. He's the key link in Bhargav's missing case. Okay. Send them. Don't worry. Go on. Come on. I'm with you. Come to me, my dear daughter. What hurt me was that they should've stayed back and convinced us. Instead, they chose to elope. Come to me, my dear. Go on. Seeing my daughter makes me feel alive. I'm very grateful to you. I shall take your leave then. Where are you taking him? Ravi is our boy now. He's family now. Come here son. You carry on, Sir. Okay. Also, Gurudev Sir had promised to bring my daughter back. He's stuck to his promise. Thank him for me. Sure. You've always complained that I never made time for you. I've freed myself just for you today. You said the only connection we had was through this phone. Even this won't be disturbing me today. No mobile. No calls. No interruption. Really? Yep. What happened? ♪ Arey!

Around the world, even if you ask a small kid for his father and mother's name, he'll tell them. Yet, there I was, who had no clue what my own name was. Even a stray in an alley gets to eat a meal once a day. But when I begged for foo, nobody offered me a morsel. It was during such times, Nana offered me food. He stood as my best friend and gave me a life. He named me Bali and I stood by him as his strength. I ensured that Nana's head was free of worries and that his face was free from fear. But... For the first time... I saw fear in my Nana's eyes. I felt like getting rid of that fear. I did. You get all cocky claiming the power and strength of your Khaki?! I don't sense an ounce of it. It is my khaki that is sparing you today. Listen carefully. Instead of tiring yourself out trying to beat me... Go look for the buried khaki. Drag that motherfucker along! Bali who's been found guilty of Inspector Bhargav's murder has been sentenced for life. Bali... Don't worry. I'll get you out at the earliest. It's an unidentified dead body, Sir. It's been approximately 74 hours since his death. He must be anywhere between 22-24 years old Speaking of his injuries... Right portion of the face and the skull bone has been completely crushed. His knee-joints, ribs and backbones have been damaged. The right side of his body has stab injuries. His right wrist has a tattoo. Injuries indicates patellar fracture in the right knee region. I'll trust you and come along. Ravi... My son Ravi's in Mumbai. He'd called me yesterday. He said he'll be back next week. You're an educated man. Please don't say such things. He's far away from us. He'll be fine, wherever he is. We need to continue living here. Please leave us alone. Shall we go? I'll see you then. Oh! You're leaving. Yes. Good night friends. You go inside. Tell me Gurudev. At the end of the police training, we take a goddamn oath to protect the dignity, property and lives of the public. You took an oath, yet you turned tables like a politician. The public fears and assumes the police to be dishonest But if ever they face problems, they come to the very police. Because they goddamn believe that not every cop is the same. You broke that trust. The gory plight of those parents who couldn't accept the dead body of their own son lying in front of them. The guilt of not having been able to save the life of the very boy who trusted me. Dammit! A cop should be tough. But shouldn't turn into a savage. Who is responsible for this? Father! Listen to my words carefully! I don't give a damn if you wonder if a father like me can exist! The number of times you touched my daughter's body all these days. The same number will be matched by my men today. But instead, you'll bleed. How dare you elope?! It didn't feel right to having left Ravi behind. I've never been biased because you're a girl. I kept my daughter in my heart. I wore you as a crown on my head and brought you up. For wrongly naming you as Bhoomi, you made my reputation bite the dust. If I spare you now, people will think Dada spared his daughter. If we put up a board warning you not to meddle with our women... People blabber about discrimination and casteism. So, make sure you beat their lives out of them. Their death should be a lesson to everyone else! I've seen you take your first breath. I don't wish to see you take your last. Writhe in pain and die! All because of caste, he had turned into a savage. He'd brutally bludgeoned his daughter. No matter what action I took against them. My family would've suffered. I could do only one thing. I took Bhoomi who was on the verge of dying, to the hospital. I will file the FIR for this case. You should be the main witness. She's been beaten up inhumanely. When she was admitted here, her condition was critical. But it'll take a lot of time for her to recover. Moreover, she's pregnant. Bhoomi... What wrong did we do, Sir? We trusted you... You claimed to be with us and handed us over to the Commissioner. He took us and handed us over to hell. Your duty matters to you. To my family... Caste matters the most. Isn't somebody's life of any importance to anyone? I'll get you justice. What will I do with justice in hand? In the end, do me one favour. Tell me, Bhoomi. Kill me right now. I can't bear this pain. If ever I'm reborn, I don't wish to be born in this caste. I don't even want to be born as a human being. ALL HAIL BHOLENATH MAHARAJ! ALL HAIL MAHADEV! You've bludgeoned your own daughter inhumanely. Are you even a human? What did you gain? Our caste. Caste needs to prevail. Just like the snake's scales, you're covered in the scales of caste. We shall not compromise in this matter. You saw what we are capable of. I didn't even spare my own sister. We beat her to death. Bhoomi is alive. Ravi's offspring is growing in her womb. Bhoomi is my creation. I shall dig that every earth and rip the roots out. You're waiting to destroy Bhoomi. I'm standing here to protect her. Victory is always on the side of the protector. That is the law of the nature. I vowed to ensure that his shadow doesn't fall on us. Instead, his seed continues to grow in my daughter's womb. That foetus and my daughter... Both shouldn't survive. What will you have? No. Thank you, Sir. Why's that? Duty hours. Get us the bill. All the buzz from the booze died. Even if a murderer rears a dog, it'll be loyal to him. Here you go. Stay loyal to me. Bhoomi needs to be safeguarded. I always paid importance to money. Today, I'm disgusted by that. Maybe if I'd met an officer like you when I joined the force, I probably would've changed for the better long ago. Please forgive me. It's not my forgivance that you need. It should be from those who were exploited by you. You might escape from the law. But Karma won't spare you. Be it an Ayurvedic, Private or a Government hospital. Don't spare any. Check every ward out there. If you find her, don't bother calling me. Finish her right there. Throw her into the mortuary and then call me. Dada, we've been looking for Bhoomi in all the wrong places. But he's hoarding her in his own station. Make sure you... Kill her first, get home and wash my blood stained hands in front of you. Sharief! Close the damn doors! Turn off the lights! Close all the doors! Madam, please go inside. Bhoomi! Take these off! Wake up! Your brother's here! Grab the tables! Bring them too! Block the doors! Give me the gun madam! Pass the guns! Open the damn doors! I'll be back. Sir, Nana and his gang have attacked the station! We're trying to stop them! Get here right away! Run! Open that door! Hurl it at them! Bhoomi! Sampath Sir! Hurry up! She needs help! Hurry! Get her some water! Somebody check what's happening! Wake up, Bhoomi! Careful! Slowly get her down! Ay! Khaki! How many more people should die because of her?! If I die, somebody else will take my place. They will continue to come. Do this! Finish her yourself! The game will end right here. Anyway you've decided to finish me here. Let me have my last smoke! If you provoke the protector in a cop, the protector will turn into a monster. This is not a fish market. It's a hospital. Except for two people related to the corpse, everyone else get the heck out of here! Here's the post-mortem report. Read it out to him. He's illiterate. The skull has suffered severe damage. The spine is broken in three points. There are two fractures in the right shoulder. The force of the 9 MM bullet has shattered the heart into pieces. Since multiple fractures... Hand over the body to them. Tell him that the death certificate will be available in 3 days. Not the caste certificate. Even if another single cracker bursts, my pistol will open fire. This is our tradition, Sir. Limit your traditions to a cemetery. This is a hospital There's a school ahead. This is unfair. We have to conduct a procession. Cremate him just like the civic body buries the dead strays. A silent procession. 'Nobody should pull the shutters of their shops' 'The dead man isn't a soldier, artist, sportsperson or a litterateur.' 'He's just an asshole!' 'Just another asshole!' 'Kindly don't pull the shutters of your shops' 'The dead man isn't a soldier, artist, sportsperson or a litterateur.' 'Just... another... asshole! This is my way of justice. Accept your fault and surrender. Or else, everybody will be sleeping like this soon. Get Bali out right away! Okay, Sir. Dev, even though she's recovering physically. I don't see her recovering mentally. She needs a family now. I think only a family can help her recuperate. Think about it. If you're thinking that, Dada's grown senile. That he's gotten softer after his son's death. You're wrong. The tiger's roar might have stopped. Not its savagery. A tiger cub has died. My son has showed the world that he's ready to offer his head to save the dignity of the clan. I give you a responsibility. The one who stained my reputation, shouldn't be alive on this earth. She needs to be chopped down! Ay! It is my Nana who died. Your daughter's not the reason for it. I need that man in the Khaki. I have a lot of pet and guard dogs. I didn't have a hunting dog. That is why I got you out on bail. I asked you to stab. How dare you back stab me?! Get lost! Your son's soul... is growing in her womb. She's suffered inhumanely at a young age. At this hour, she badly needs all of you. You didn't accept Ravi's love, his marriage or his corpse. I understand you were all afraid. But now... I'm with her. Bravely take her home. Go on, Bhoomi. Hello? Ay Khaki! Did you save Bhoomi? Bali! You seem to save everyone in the town. Is your family safe enough? Hello Ganga? Yes, Dev? Where are you? I'm home. Okay. Lock the door and be careful. Why? What's wrong, Dev? You asshole! Only those who live with you, aren't your only family. Those who trust you and work with you... They're your family too. If you've got the balls... Try saving your police family. Sharief?! Hello? The next target is... The women constables. Shift them to the ambulance right away. Kamala, stay careful! You're on the right track. But you're not fast enough. Bali! I'll kill you brutally! You son of a bitch! Motherfucker! What do you think of the cops?! I'll chop you down to pieces, bastard! If you're a man enough, come fight me. Let her go! Now! What did you say?! I'm warning you! Let her go, Bali! I did. Bali, you motherfucker! I will finish you! Will the police get attacked for no reason? Their inhuman behaviour has led to this. No police officer will do this intentionally. Enough with the bluffing! All of this is happening because your officer killed Nana to avenge his personal grudges! If there's riot on the streets, you lock your doors and sit tight. But you will never realise the responsibilities of the officers who never close their station doors down. Lock them up and leave! Not like this world won't run without you. Don't treat the police so hastily. Sir, the media's waiting for you outside. Word is that you and Nana had personal feud. So you killed him. What do you have to say for it? Nana is a criminal. What personal grudge can I have against him? This is just your excuse. The entire town know that this is on you. The police have to rough up some if they need to maintain law and order. I didn't barge into his house and shoot him down. I shot him because he barged into my station. The police officers lying inside the ICU aren't suffering for their mistakes. They're suffering for doing their duty. It's your illusion to believe that the Police are the superior power. You're the one under an illusion, if you think the Media's the supreme power. I need to provide explanation to my department. Not the media. Listen, the police might turn up. Smoke elsewhere. Nobody will come today. Don't worry. For the first time in the history of Karnataka, the police department has announced to go on a strike. Fear continues to rise among the public. Drugs are being sold out in the open. With traffic congestion bugging the public, chain snatchers are having a field day. Gangsters have fearlessly gotten into robbing ATMs, murders and extortion. Sir! What is all this?! Who permitted you to go on a strike? Don't you have any common sense? I'll suspend you all and send you home. Do suspend us, Sir. Instead of being a powerless police officer, it is better to get suspended and stay home. Right from the CM - a chief minister to the other CM - the common man. Everybody needs a police officer. We're needed when the nominations are announced, during the elections, vote counting and the swearing-in ceremony. Once a politician is elected, we're needed at the front and back. We're needed at jewellery stores and to protect a jewellery wearing woman. We're needed at the inauguration of a memorial and to guard them. We're needed during casual strolls, during accidents. We're expected to guard the cars and park them too. We're needed when prices are hiked, when there are strikes and protests. We're needed at important meetings and even at film shoots. Temples, mosques and churches need us. The police... are a need. Only when there are issues, the police is needed. But when the police face issues, nobody cares for them. When there's no soldier at the border, the enemy will barge inside. If there are no police here, your neighbours will turn into your enemies. When it's about our duty, we work for everybody. For those who address as 'Sir' and even for those who deride us by calling us 'Maama'. Sir, we teach our children about Buddha, Ba savanna, the Daasas and the Sharanas. We teach them about everyone. We teach them about Ambedkar's constitution. We teach them to be humans. When those very children adapt their teachings, rise above religion-caste-creed, fall in love and wish to get married... We kill them. We also justify the killings. We question those who stand by the children and protect those who kill them. Honour killings. It isn't just an ordinary killing. It's a pre-planned murder. If we can't send them a strong message... If we can't render hope to the sullen souls... What's the point of you and I being here? This is an insult to our law and system. Okay. I give you complete power. Firstly, end the strike. Because if the police go on a strike... It's more than the failure of a government. It accounts for the failure of a system. This system needs the police. Gurudev, go ahead. Yes, Sir. JUSTICE FOR RAVI! ALL HAIL DADA! You arrested me claiming I committed a crime, right? Take a good look at me. If I was wrong, I wouldn't be garlanded and hailed! You might believe that I lost. Nope. I've won all of their hearts. Get inside! Hello? I became a police officer because I wanted to. I didn't give enough time for my family. I risked their lives too. Be it the department, the Home Minister or the gangsters. I went against everybody. I was prepared to lose my job. I was prepared to lose my life too. I didn't spare them, Bhoomi. I've made them all stand in the court of law. If they should be punished, I need evidence. My only primary witness was... Commissioner Prakash. Somebody killed him too. My last witness is... You alone. If you testify, they will be punished. You and your child, will live on. I will not testify, Sir. Even if they are sentenced to life... They will finish their sentences and return to finish me. In my quest for justice, I've lost Ravi. I'm not ready to lose this child too. Most victims of honour killings like you would've lost their spirit to fight back, fearing violence and tyranny. You should be an example to them, Bhoomi. This concept of being superior or inferior and disparity has been fed to them with morsels, since their childhood. If this was just an act, it could've been stopped. But it's a deep-rooted thought. And that will never change. Sorry Sir. Order.. Order.. Order. Bali who was out on bail granted by court, in those very court surroundings... Will chase Inspector Gurudev and stab him repeatedly in the heart, sentencing him to death. Ay Khaki! Irrespective of whether Dada will get out or go behind the bars... You.. will breath your last. With respect to the incident regarding Ravi's honour-killing and Bhoomi's homicide case... Since the public prosecutor has failed to provide any evidence to prove the guilt of the accused... The court has declared the accused as innocent and orders his release. ALL HAIL DADA! When will the children of the poor get justice?! Sir, on that day, a riot broke out of the blue. They began to attack with everything they could lay their hands on. The force available was inadequate. When the mob became unruly, officer Gurudev ordered for a lathi-charge. Control Room? The riot is escalating. They're attacking the police. Send the Reserve Police to the spot at the earliest. Who ordered the firing of tear gas? Sir, the back-up team needed 45 more minutes to get there. If tear gas wasn't opened, things would've gotten way worse. I don't get it. You were present at the spot. You had weapons. There were fifteen of you. Yet the fight broke out. Public property has been lost. People have lost their lives. Both the police and innocent civilians have suffered... It might seem wrong for a daughter to do this. But as a mother, I'm doing the right thing to protect my child. On 24-02-21, the riots that broke out in the city has caused massive loss of property and lives. The local police station Inspector Gurudev... ASI Sampath... Constables - Sharief, Kamala and Mala... Since the incident occurred in their presence. Their incompetency in discharging their duty is evident. Therefore, the disciplinary body has decided to suspend these officials for six months. Is all of this your doing?! Didn't I already tell you that there's a villain in me?!
