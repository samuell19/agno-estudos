THE AMERICAN FRIEND - Who is it? - It's Ripley. The door's open. Believe it or not. I've been waiting for you for two months. How are you doing, Master Titian? You son of a bitch, my name is Pogash. When did you leave Hamburg? This morning. - How's your wife? - What wife? - When do you go back? - Tonight. I think you're not a very serious man. I think this is serious. I sold one painting. I'm ready to sell another one. - How much? - That's $2,000 for you. I told you I got a good eye. Take care of it. A new one's hard to buy. Don't you think I know that? Mm-hmm. Now, this... I think I can get even more for this one. I could use two of these in six months. In six months I can paint five. Try to sell five. Two. Don't be too busy for a dead painter. Do you wear that hat in Hamburg? What's wrong with a cowboy in Hamburg? Dedicated to Henri Langlois It's December 6th... 1976. There is nothing to fear... but fear itself. I know less and less about, uh... who I am... or who anybody else is. Even this river... This river reminds me of another river. Ladies and gentlemen, we now come to the high point... of the auction. A particularly fine later Derwatt. May I see it again? Thank you. As you know, there are few Derwatts left on the market. This may be your last chance. Lot 132... Derwatt.

Are you still bidding? 28,000. 30,000 marks. Anyone else? I wouldn't go so high. Why not? - I have my doubts about it. - What's wrong with it? I spent three days framing it. Look at the colors. The blue's not right... compared to other Derwatts. It'll be a sure thing in America. "A sure thing in America." - They'll snatch it up in Texas. - Ah. 36,000... 38,000. - In Texas? - Yeah, in Texas.

Help yourselves to refreshments. - Satisfied? - Yep. Very. - Congratulations, Mr. Winter. - Thank you. - How's Daniel? - Fine. Will you take the painting with you? No. Send it to New York. I won't be back till after Christmas. I'm going into the wilderness in Canada. No telephones, no anything. This didn't reach our reserve price. Again. - Ciao. - Ciao. Mr. Winter, are you satisfied? As always. Although Jonathan doesn't like the blue. May I introduce to... Mr. Ripley, Mr. Winter. - Pleasure. - Mr. Zimmermann. Ja, ja. I've heard of you. Let's go, Allan. You'll miss your plane. Don't let it bother you. Mr. Zimmermann is under a lot of pressure. He's a good picture framer... but no longer a competent restorer. Why's that? He's ill. A blood disease. No hope of recovery. Hopeless... maybe. And his treatment is expensive. His wife has to help support them. I know you're not asleep. Where were you? What woke you up? The noisy trucks. We're home for good now. Good night. Sleep well. Can I have the light on? Sure. Freeze, mister. I got a gun. I want you to move out real slow... and keep your arms stretched out way in front of you. I want to see your hands. Real slow, now. Cut the crap, Tom. I am waiting for two hours. Break into my house? I ought to blow you away. You know, I gotta tell you the truth. The only reason I don't is because someone might hear me. I sent you a telegram, Tom. A telegram, huh? Now, get your ass inside here. Someone who would look absolutely incapable of doing such a thing. Listen... I know rock musicians, I know lawyers... I know art dealers, pimps, politicians. But murder? I don't want to be involved, period. It's not that easy, Tom. You owe me something. Don't forget. All right. But this is crazy, Minot. I believe we said 60 marks. I'm afraid it came to a bit more. Mother left it to me. My brother has no eye for art. It's another 20 marks. No, it'll fit in my purse just fine. Eighty marks. I'm very pleased with it. God, you're a sly one! - I'll put it up in its old place. - Right. Thank you so much. It's lovely. - It's a beautiful picture. - It was my mother's. - Good-bye. - Good-bye. All the best. Eighty marks! My German is terrible. Make me a frame. - A frame? - Frame. We, uh... We can speak English. That's good. Well, I suggest... this one, yeah? Mm-hmm. Yeah. Oh. Mm. Complements the picture. How long is it gonna take? Two, three days, ja? That's fast. Gantner told me that you were a good craftsman. Uh, I admire that. I've always wanted to be able to make something with my hands... but, uh, well... some people have it and some people don't. May I... May I show you something? You have to move it. See? Ah! Do you like it? Yeah. I give it to you. Really? Why? Well, you see, the last time we met... my behavior, I, uh... Well, I wasn't polite. I don't know. Bitte. Please, forget it. I don't like people who... buy paintings... as an investment. Well... you can count me out. No. I count you in. I'll be back one of these days. With your left hand. Daniel, no! Jonathan. - Your left hand. - Jonathan. You were dreaming. "Jonathan, I was shocked at the news. I was shocked to hear... that your blood disease has gotten worse. I was embarrassed to speak to you about it. If money is a problem, let me know. I'll be back in New York in three weeks." That's right. He's in Canada. "Won't let you down. What are friends for? Yours, Allan." Written at the airport. "...that your illness has quickly gotten worse." He could have told me in the car. Who told him this? I should be the first to know. BACK SHORTLY Ah, my most interesting patient. But I have no time to see you now. I just need a minute. Were the results of my last examination particularly unfavorable? You saw the test reports... and we discussed them. There are no alarming developments. - Are you feeling worse? - No. Not at all. It's just that... a friend of mine heard somewhere that I don't have... much longer to live. Mr. Zimmermann... where did this friend hear such nonsense? Certainly not from me. Your condition remains unchanged. Everything else is just rumormongering. Marianne? Your wife went to the post office. You spoke to Allan Winter before the auction yesterday. That's right. What about it? Did you talk about me? No. Why? - You know about my illness. - But I'd never discuss it. Someone's been spreading some ridiculous hogwash about me. I'm sure it wasn't done maliciously. Mr. Zimmermann? Hello, Mr. Zimmermann. My name is Raoul Duplat. You don't know me. - Vous parlez fran√ßais? - No. - English? - Yes. You don't know me, but I know you very well. I want to talk with you about a business. Are you an art dealer? In a certain way. Let's go. I want to show you something. We'll take the metro. I live in Paris. Briefly... I need one person eliminated. Possibly two. Well, now my cards are on the table. - You must be joking. - Not at all. Where did you get my name? Never mind. Are you interested... in 250,000 marks for shooting one man, maybe two? It's safe and easy. I don't know where you might have heard... that I am a gunman. You must take me for somebody else. No, Mr. Zimmermann. Listen... we know you are not going to live very much longer. - You've got a wife, a little boy. - Who told you all that? Wouldn't you like to leave them some money when you die? - This is nonsense. - I'm afraid it's not. Maybe your doctor don't tell you the truth. But you know the truth? Listen... I'm completely informed about my sickness. I know I have a blood disease. I'm sorry, Mr. Zimmermann. You are not completely informed. But at least it seems you know what I'm talking about. It's your own free choice, but it's a lot of money. You could stop working and enjoy the rest of your life. I'm not a killer, mister. Good! That's just what we need... someone who is not connected to us. The man I want you to shoot, Mr. Zimmermann... is a criminal. - Belongs to the Mafia. - Now, stop it. - You're out of your mind. - Think about it. I'm staying here all day, at the Pacific Hotel. You're out of breath. You know you mustn't overexert yourself. - So you noticed. - Noticed what? - You left your scarf and cap. - Did I? I came to ask you to do the next sternal puncture. I was just going home. Please. It would put my mind at ease. Mr. Zimmermann, I wanted to tell you earlier. In your situation there is no certainty. No doctor in the world could guarantee you... five years, one year, a month. Where could he have heard that? Dr. Gabriel says it's nonsense. He says I shouldn't worry. My condition is unchanged. It's just a rumor. Gantner knows nothing about it... or so he says. Daniel's probably awake. Will he remember me? "My father had a mustache. We lived near the harbor in a building that's been torn down." It's starting all over again. Last time was three months ago. Ah, good morning, Mr. Zimmermann. I was expecting your call. Don't say anything. Listen... I have a proposition for you. Come to Paris and see a doctor to get a new opinion... about your state of health. I already made a date for you with a hematologist. There is no obligation for you. Take the first flight tomorrow morning at 7:00. That's why I sent you the money. - Dr. Gabriel! - Ah! I was on my way to see you. Any word on the tests? The results can't possibly be ready yet. We just sent the samples to the lab this morning. Perhaps tomorrow or the next day. - Maybe they're ready now. - Impossible. Check with me in two days. Two days. You could call them now. Sometimes I don't understand you anymore. There's no point calling. There are no results yet. Anyway, they'll be the same as last time. What if they're worse? Sometimes I think that's what you want. - I'm going to Paris. - Why? A client got me an appointment... at a hospital there. They have specialists. - You're leaving tonight? - Tomorrow morning. Gotta be at the airport before 7:00 for a 7:30 flight. All because of that telegram? It really got me worried. I'd like to know where things really stand. If I put it off, I'll never do it. Suppose the telegram wasn't from Allan? Who else would have sent it? Huh? Wake up, Mr. Zimmermann. Excuse me. I'm late. You had a good flight? You're feeling well? I took the appointment for you at 10:00 at the hospital. We have no more time to lose. Rudolf studies medicine. He will stay with you and help you... if there should be any problems. We go to the American Hospital. It's the best one in Paris. World-famous. Onassis died there. Jean Gabin too. I don't intend to die here. I think it's normal to see another doctor... in such a serious case. Mommy, shall I answer it? Yes. Ask who it is. Yes? No, just my mother. The doctor. Coming. She isn't here yet. She's coming. Dummy! You look in the side, not the top. Dummy yourself! Stop. Stop. Daniel, be careful with those things. Dr. Gabriel? He isn't here today. He's in Paris. I thought you knew. I see. Any message for him? When was it first diagnosed? 1971. No, '72. And you've had regular treatments? Yes. Where are you from? Hamburg. Northern Germany. Is the Reeperbahn still as exciting? - Are you Swiss? - I studied medicine in Berne. But you're Swiss too. A Z√ºrich boy. Good. Then you can stand a lot. This is gonna be painful in any language. Yes, I know. Let's do it. Have you thought about the other affair? The proposition I made in Hamburg? Well, I did not change my mind. I will call you in the afternoon. Now we take you to your hotel. I'm gonna hang a sign out in my window. What's it gonna say? "I'm still alive"? No. "Deliver me from evil." I'm dead and doing very well. Andrew Pogash-Derwatt. I am alive. - You changed the blue. - What do you mean? The last painting I sold... You changed the blue. It's different from the others. How could you tell? Oh, I couldn't tell. I got a friend in Hamburg who told me. - Did you have trouble selling it? - Not at all. So... just means he's got a better eye than you. And not for very much longer, I'm afraid. - Yeah? Hello? - Hello. Jonathan? I got the report from the hospital. - I told them to work it out as soon as possible. - Already? Yes. A first summary. Oh, good. This is it. Why don't you come to my apartment? Okay. It's just on the other side of the river. If you look out your window, you can see it. It's a modern building on the left of the bridge. I'm waving with a white shawl. - Can you see me? - Yes, I can see you. All right, Jonathan. See you later. I read it, Jonathan. I'm deeply sorry. You look pale. You'd better take this. It will calm you down. - I'm very calm. - Take it. This is the man. His name is Samuel Ingraham. It's an American Jew from New Jersey. A killer. You wouldn't guess it just from the photograph. Nobody could recognize an ordinary-looking man... in a subway crowd just from a single photograph. Of course not. Rudolf is coming with you. He will show him to you. The best opportunity... where he changes... from one line to another. Keep the gun in the coat and shoot like this. And after the shot... don't run away. Take it easy. Just move like a normal passenger. Okay? A coffee. Did you hurt yourself? Thanks. What's wrong with you? I'm confused. Don't try to be a nice guy. I want to go home. Let me love you for your money. I'm confused! Close the doors, they'll come in through the windows. A little older... a little more confused. You better watch your step, cowboy. Mm, I see. I see. You say he was shot? The subway? In Paris? No, I didn't have anything... - Mona! - Will you repeat that? Yes. - I can't hear you. - Come on! Speak a little louder. Make it plainer. I can hear you now. Go ahead. Hi. We saw you from the window. - I suspected you'd be back this morning. - I took the first plane. - What's that cut? - Nothing serious. - Did you bring me anything? - I'm sorry. I had no time. - Were you bleeding? - A bit. Nothing serious. Michael didn't believe you'd gone to... Paris! It's true. I went to Paris. What did the doctors say? They can't say if it's worse until they've seen my case notes. Gabriel has to send them. We have to go. Come here. See you later. That's not my frame, I hope. It's been one of those days... for you. I'm sorry. Your frame is not ready yet. - I wasn't here yesterday. - That's all right. - Cut your head? - It's nothing. But I started to work on your frame. - Let me see it. - What? The frame. It's in my workshop... in the back room. I like this room. It's got a good feel to it. It's quiet and peaceful. It's like you. I envy you. The smell of paint and wood. Must be good to work here. And when you finish something, you can see what you've done. Well, it's not that easy. Not that... safe and easy. What do you make? I make money... and I travel a lot. I'm bringing the Beatles back to Hamburg. Well, I don't believe you. It's an old rumor. This is no rumor. "Rumor." There wasn't time to tell you this morning. The doctors in Paris sort of advanced me some money... because I'll probably have to go back. That must mean it's serious... or they wouldn't give you money. They're taking a risk, and so am I. And if it's successful? - If it's successful? - Yes. Then I can live a few more years. Hello? I take the night train. I arrive tomorrow morning at 9:40. I have something very pleasant for you. Okay. I'll see you at the station. That was the specialist in Paris. He'll be here tomorrow on business... and he wants to see me. He wants to proceed with the treatment. I don't believe you. What? I simply don't believe you. You went to Paris for some other reason. What sort of reason? How would I know? You don't tell me anything. There is less than half of what you promised me. I told you that there might be a second case. Count me out. I made another date with a specialist in blood diseases. - Where? - Munich. - When? - Tomorrow. - On a Sunday? - Yes. It's a private arrangement. I want you to take the train back to Hamburg in the afternoon. There is a man in the train, I suppose. Exactly. Oh, Jonathan... the first part went so well. I will see the doctor in Munich. I will be on the train. But I will be sleeping on the train... and enjoying the ride. Did you read the papers? - Yeah. Congratulations. - To you. What do you mean? - It was your idea. - Shut up! Oh, you are too sensitive, Tom. He will do it again. What? An American on the train. Belongs to the other organization. You never told me about, uh... any second murder, Minot. So what? It will look like revenge for the murder in the metro... and that's what I want. Doesn't make any sense. And it won't work. And it's much too dangerous in a train. This man can't cope with it. No. You get a professional. I trust him. He won't ever do it. Framed. That your son? Daniel. Danny. Dan. Look what I found. Mm-hmm. - You turn it like... - Uh-huh. You just... turn it. - Well. - You like it? - Mm-hmm. - I'm gonna give it to you. Why? Because the last time I saw you, your behavior was so disgusting... You know what I mean? - You restore old paintings, huh? - Yep. Some workers at my house today... badly damaged one of mine. I'll be home all day tomorrow... and, uh, maybe you could come by. No. Tomorrow I can't. I don't live very far from here. No. Tomorrow I have to make a little trip. I see. We have to be going. It'll be half an hour in this traffic. Have a good trip. Thank you a lot for your present. A present? I gave him one when he brought the engraving. You seem to know him well. It's December 6th... 1976. There's nothing to fear but fear itself. I know less and less about, uh... who I am... or who anybody else is. Get out. I'll wait for you tomorrow morning. 7:00 in the taxi. Train station. Maybe even we can... as far as Asia is concerned, send them about 50-75 prints. I think we can do very well... if we wrap up the German coproduction situation. The big one with the blue hat. The two others are bodyguards. I don't know the old one with the girl, but don't worry. Do you have the gun and the other thing? Did I give you the tickets? My wife will get the money, whatever happens to me, yeah? She will, Jonathan, for sure. A letter for Zimmermann. Thank you. Hi, Jon. Well, now it looks like we're gonna have to finish this. Hey. Here. Have a drink of this. All right! A friend is in there. He's sick. It's a friend of ours. Yes. Yes. Knock three times if everything's okay. Fifth-round knockout. Understand what I mean? No drinking water. Come out. Quickly, come out! Come out! The bodyguard! Where? He's coming right back. The gun... where's the gun? No, no. It's occupied. It's occupied. Ticket, please. Just a minute. You put it in the blue jacket. Watch that corridor! Open the door! Give me a hand here! Give me a hand here! Hey! Okay! Tomorrow in your shop. Move! - Move! Move! - Thank you, Tom. Thank you. This time I brought you something. What's that? It spins around. It's called a gyroscope. Your hand shook, but you did it. Oh. Hello? I'm Jonathan's wife. Who are you? I cannot talk now. I'm sorry. I've had enough! Who was that? Your specialist again? I want you to tell me the truth. And don't say you had a checkup... not on a Sunday! I'm sure your sudden trips... are part of Gantner and Ripley's crooked deals. What dirty work are you doing? What are they paying you? Be quiet. I've had enough of your lying and skulking around. Please be quiet. I feel so deserted and betrayed. The worst part is you're using your illness to deceive me. Fine! I don't care what you do with your American friend! Be glad you know nothing about this. This is funny. They calculated that between the first and second man... four minutes must've passed. You throw a gangster off a train going 80 miles an hour... and then throw a second one, how much time passes between the two... if the train doesn't change speed in between? Right? Four minutes. Mm-hmm. Yeah. I guess you'll want some of the money. Keep the other half. I don't want it anyway. No, that's not so. Why were you on the train? I wanted to prevent a second murder. But you didn't mind the first. Ah. But, uh... you had a choice. I didn't know how, uh... insane Minot's plans were gonna become. Oh, by the way... you did the job on the train alone. I don't want Minot to know that I was there. - You were alone. - You really don't want anything? I wouldn't know possibly what I could want from you. I would like to be your friend. But friendship isn't possible. That makes me feel... very comfortable. Why did you spread this rumor... that I am with one foot in the grave? You remember that day we were introduced at the auction... - and you said, "Ja, ja..." - "I've heard of you." "I've heard of you." You said that in a very nasty way. That was all? Isn't that enough? Hello? Hello? 97,000 marks. Where'd it come from? The doctors in Paris and Munich made a bet. A bet on my life, so to speak. Who do you think will win? These are the stakes. You're crazy. I get nothing out of it. Jonathan. What's gone wrong, Jonathan? What happened? They bombed my flat in Paris. All blew up. Did you tell anybody about me? What? Something wrong in the train? Why are they after me? How can they know about me? I don't know. Everything went fine. We killed a man and one of his bodyguards. What do you mean, "we"? Tom and me. Tom? Tom Ripley? Yes. That son of a bitch. Tom? It's me. I've got to see you. I don't know what to do. Minot was here. Stay cool, you know what I mean? I'm coming now to pick you up. You hear me? I almost shot you, man. Take this and come with me, okay? Just come with me. What do you want me to do here? I want you to stay in there. 'Cause from here... you can see anybody approaching the house. - Take care of it, all right? We know somebody's gonna show up. - Who? "Who"? What do I know? Minot, the Mafia... I'm on the roof with a gun. But I don't want to use it because of the neighbors. Jonathan? Jonathan? I brought you something to keep you alive. Like this, I'm not going to live very much longer. Give me a cigarette, please. You must be freezing out there. I'm thinking about you all the time. Get his jacket and his hat. Ambulance. What the hell is holding up Angie? Minot! Angie? Jon! Jon! Just take it! Run. Run! You have to drive the second car. What? You have to drive the second car. - Okay. - Jonathan... Move over. It's automatic. All you have to do is start it... put it in gear, step on the gas... steer. It's gonna be a long road, Jon... but we're gonna make it. Oh, shit! I looked for you everywhere. Let's go home. We can discuss everything... calmly. I talked to Dr. Gabriel. They tricked you in Paris. Those medical reports were faked. Come on. You don't have to explain now. Mrs. Zimmermann, it's all right. Mrs. Zimmermann... you can settle your problems tomorrow. Then you have plenty of time. We're in a lot of trouble. Help us. Now, if you want to help your husband... you'd better drive a car... and follow us in the ambulance. Please? I think he's too exhausted to do it. Try to sleep a bit. - Sure it's okay? - Yes. Where's he headed? I don't know. I think to the sea. So, Angie, can't win 'em all, huh? Should have kept your seatbelt on. Move back. Move back! Yeah! Jonathan! Jonathan! Stop, Jonathan! Fucker! He'll never bring the Beatles back to Hamburg. Maybe I should drive. I'll make it to Hamburg... back to Daniel. One day you'll have to explain everything to him. Marianne, it's getting so dark. Jonathan! Jonathan! Oh, well. We made it, anyway, Jonathan. Be careful. THE AMERICAN FRIEND
