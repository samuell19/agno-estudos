For those continuing with the second part of this course next semester, we will explore the development and evolution of social customs. For example, the first recorded marriage contract can be traced back 4,000 years. Those records were found primarily in Mesopotamia and seem to have only existed as ways of preserving power and furthering lineages. I’d like to think times have changed since then. It wasn’t until the Enlightenment that the notion of marrying for love became widely accepted. All right, who forgot to turn their cellphone off from the last class? I think it’s coming from outside. That’s so weird. - Is that Professor Larson? - What? I will be right back. What is all of this? Happy anniversary! Hold that thought. So six months ago today was our very first date, and ever since the moment that you bumped into me and spilled my coffee everywhere, I knew you were the one. And I never understood the saying, "When you know, you know," till I met you. So... Dr. Stephanie Bishop, will you marry me? - Yes. - Yes? Yes, a million times, yes. Whew! Ah, it’s a little loose. It doesn’t matter. I love it. - And I love you. - I love you too. I love how you basically highlighted this entire article. He makes a lot of good points. You know, between his books and his Ted Talks, you’re kind of a fan boy. And I am very proud of it. Are you almost done? We still have to swing by my apartment. Hey, quick question. Which color bathing suit conveys to your family how honored I am to spend the summer with them at their vacation house? And also how much I love you, and I’m excited to marry you? I’m not sure you can get all that from a bathing suit color. I think green. You know you have nothing to be nervous about. I’m not nervous. Okay, I’m a little nervous. I met them one time for like five minutes in passing. Now I’m spending a significant amount of time with them, and you are so close. I just really want them to like me. They will love you because I love you. Besides, after a few rounds of golf on the course with my dad, you will be best buds. I never played golf. - Like ever? - No. Don’t worry. You will be fine. Okay, maybe I could take a few lessons. We don’t leave for a few hours. Ben, how many sweaters did you pack? - I like to layer. - Yes, but it’s Palm Springs, and we’re gonna be in flip-flops most of the time. And I was a Boy Scout. I go prepared. See? Now it actually closes, and you have room for other things like... a magazine, some light reading by the pool. You make fun, but James Quincy’s article on emerging markets will make you rethink everything you thought you knew about economics. I’m sorry you got passed over for that job with Quincy. I’m not. If I got the teaching job at Oxford, I never would’ve met you. Then I guess everything worked out the way it was supposed to. Sure did. Now I’m engaged to an almost-tenured professor, and we’re going to Palm Springs to spend time with people that you love most. I love the sound of that. "Tenured professor." You worked really hard. I’m proud of you. Life is good. - How’s it fit? - It fits perfectly. I’m sorry it was a little loose before, but I didn’t wanna ruin the surprise by asking you what size ring you wear. - Thought I guessed right. - You were close. I know you get superstitious about that kind of stuff, so please, for me, do not read into it. You mean how like in 16th century Persia, if the ring didn’t fit, it was seen as a bad omen? It might've crossed my mind for a moment, but then I realized it’s a myth and not at all real. Ah, the perks of dating an anthropology professor. Engaged to. Hi, Dad. Calling for an ETA? Yes, yes, your mom wants to know how much to make for dinner. Uh, we’re gonna leave here in a few hours, so we should be on time. Are Tracy and Preston there yet? Uh, no, their flight was delayed out of San Francisco. Listen, Stephanie, uh... Yeah? Um, drive safe. We will. Love you. Love you too. Okay. - Did you tell her? - I was about to, but it didn’t feel like the right moment. It’s a lot to spring on them, but the girls will understand. I hope so. They love this house and all the summers we’ve spent here. It’s hard telling them we’re selling it. I know, but they know you’re retiring and that we’ve always wanted to travel. I know, but it’s big news. We should tell them in person. All right. Then somebody better go take the "For Sale" sign off the lawn. Right. Good thinking. So every summer, Dad would take a month off from the clinic so that we could all be together at the house for some Bishop family bonding time. It’s where I took my first steps, it’s where I learned to swim, and the country club hosts this super fun jamboree on the Fourth of July. This place sounds like more than just a house. What? I have an idea. Okay. What if we get married at the vacation house on the Fourth of July? Fireworks and all. Like this Fourth of July, in four weeks. No, of course not this Fourth of July. Next summer. We’ve got the time. - I love it. - You do? Yeah, if it’s your dream to get married on the Fourth of July at your family vacation house, then it’s mine too. Wow. This place is amazing. - Home away from home. - I love it. Wait till you see the backyard. - Here we are. - Oh, there she is! Hi, Mom! Perfect timing. And Ben. Ben, we’re so glad you are here. Come on, everybody, follow me. Are you okay? What’s going on? Oh, yeah. Oh, my gosh, I’m never better. I’m so excited, you two. - Come on, your Dad's waiting. - Okay. Hey, hey, hey, did you tell her already? No. Maybe one of my students posted on social media. Maybe. Honey, sweetheart, they’re here. They just arrived. Tracy, Preston, you made it. We’re so excited. - Here you go. - Welcome to the desert. Stephanie, Ben, so glad you’re here. Big news. What’s going on? A soon-to-be wedding. Wait, who told you that we’re engaged? You’re engaged? - Y-You and, uh... - Ben. Ben, right. How can you be engaged? Didn’t you just start dating? Is that not what this champagne is for? I’m so confused. No! The champagne is because Preston and I are engaged. No! - Congratulations! - Congratulations to you! Can you believe this? No, not a bit. Congratulations, Preston. Thank you. Congratulations to you as well. Stephanie and Ben are engaged. So how long have you two been dating again? Six months, but we knew right away. Six mo... Wow. Fast. And when did this happen? A couple days ago. What about you guys? Last week. Mr. Bishop, thank you for inviting me into your home. Your house is beautiful. Technically, Stephanie invited you. I just didn’t say no. Um, Steph, let me see your ring. Obviously, you’re my maid of honor. And obviously you’re mine. And since it was always our favorite holiday, Preston and I decided to get married right here at the house on the Fourth of July. I was just telling Ben that I wanted to get married on the Fourth of July. No way! Did you guys want this Fourth of July? No. Next year. Okay, great, because Preston and I wanna get married this summer. Honey, that’s only four weeks away. I know it’s fast, but Preston's grandma’s getting older, and he really wants her to be at the wedding. The longer we wait, the harder it is for her to travel, and I know how much it means for Tracy that we get married right here at the house. Well, that works for us. We can have our turn next year. Let’s just see how everything pans out. Tracy and Preston were together quite a long time before even considering an engagement. Dad. I just don’t want anyone rushing into anything. A toast... to us. - We’re both engaged! - Yay! Toast! All right, let’s give Ben the tour. Ah, yes. So how was the drive out? Enjoy! They’ve been together six months. Tracy wants to get married in four weeks. Oh, boy. Boy is right. So where do you want these? You’re two doors down from me, and it has an amazing view. I don’t think your parents were very thrilled about the engagement. They just weren’t expecting it. They’ll come around. Hope so. I know you mentioned you were engaged before. You think that’s why they’re hesitant? No, I don’t think that has anything to do with it. It was a long time ago. I think it’s just that Tracy and Preston have been together for like 10 years and not used to a relationship moving this quickly. Okay, well, I won’t worry then. Okay, good. Morning! Hi. Morning, morning, welcome. Please help yourselves. Wow! Waffle and pancakes. You don’t see that too often. Well, I know it’s silly, but it’s a tradition. When the girls were little, they couldn’t decide between waffles and pancakes, so first breakfast of every summer, we have both. You’re in full planning mode, aren’t you? Just under four weeks is not a lot of time. We’ve gotta be smart and diligent about this. Divide and conquer. Lists are key. Can you tell Tracy’s a lawyer? Oh, Ben, please help yourself. Shouldn’t we wait for Preston and Robert? Oh, no, I’m sure they grabbed something at the club. I told them to wait to see if you wanted to go, but they didn’t wanna lose their tee time. Trust me, I do not blame them. I do not know the first thing about golf. Now that you and Stephanie are engaged, you’ll have to learn. No, he doesn’t have to learn. It is not mandatory. So what’s first? Mom and I are going to look at dresses today. I already sent out the save-the-date email, but I need you to order the invitations face-up. - Oh, and look into the cake. - Frankie’s? - Where else? - What’s Frankie's? It’s a bakery we used to go to when we were little. I was thinking layered. - Obviously. - With fresh strawberries. Oh, and blueberries and cream-filled, and then it’s red, white, and blue. And if we do that, we might as well make the whole wedding coordinate with those colors. I mean, it is the Fourth of July. And my dress will be white. And mine will be blue. And that works on two levels because it will work with the wedding colors, but also you can bring me something blue. And we can do red floral arrangements. Love it! Here you go, honey. You’re gonna need it to keep up with them. - Thank you. - You’re welcome. All right, so cake and invitations. That’s not too bad, seeing as Tracy’s list was very long. Easily doable. The best part is we can use their list for our wedding. - Easy breezy. - Mm-hmm. Good morning! Good morning. Can I help you? I’m guessing you're one of the Bishop daughters. Yes. I am Stephanie. - And this is my fiancé Ben. - Nice to meet you. That’s the first time I introduced you as my fiancé. - I like it. - Me too. Well, congratulations to you both. Your parents said nothing but great things about you and your sister. Thank you. Um, who are you? Oh, I’m so sorry. Where are my manners? I’m Anna Kim, your parents' real estate broker. Their what? Broker for the house. I couldn’t wait to tell them. We have our first offer. My parents are selling the house? We wanted to tell you last night, but then you both announced you were engaged, and it took us by surprise. I can’t believe that you’re selling this house. Honey, it was a really hard decision, but with your dad about to retire, selling this house means we could travel the world. We got married so young, and then I went straight to medical school, and then you guys came along. I loved every second of it, but now we have the time. I want you guys to have this opportunity. You deserve it. It’s just gonna be hard not to have this place. How about a compromise? Your dad and I put off selling the house for a year or two, that way you can still get married here next summer. The buyer that put in an offer wants the house by the end of the summer. Well, we’ll just have to decline the offer. I highly advise against that. I mean, it’s well over the asking price, and you know the saying: Your first offer’s always the best offer. I don’t know if this helps, but it is a smart time to sell. I mean, with what you could save on property taxes alone, it’d do wonders for your retirement fund. Spoken like a true economics professor. He’s right. I don’t want you guys to miss out on a good deal '’cause of me. Stephanie, would you really be okay not getting married here? Yeah. Ben and I will find somewhere else. Definitely. Might be a blessing in disguise. That way you could take your time finding the perfect place. Nothing wrong with a long engagement. This just means we’ll have to make your wedding the best ever '’cause it'll be our final Hurrah here. So these are more traditional ones. Clean backgrounds. I like that one. Okay. - Stephanie. - Huh? What do you think? Oh, um, it’s nice. It’s just a little plain. You okay? We should pick one soon. Tracy told me she has a print shop on standby for tonight. Right. I’m just a little distracted. Sorry. You know what? Let me go grab the other binder. There might be something more your taste in there. - One sec. - Thank you. Still thinking about the house? Minor aftershock, I think. Just wasn’t expecting it. I completely get where your dad’s coming from. Although with that being said, I didn’t spend my childhood vacations here. I mean, I get why they’re selling it. I guess I just always envisioned bringing my own kids here. Our kids. What do you think of these? Ooh, I like this. I mean, it’s not really in our theme, but it is the shade of purple that is my favorite color. - Really? - Oh, totally. In middle school, I wore the same purple hoodie every day. - Drove my mom nuts. - That’s funny. Yeah, took my fashion sense a little bit of time. No, I mean, it’s funny that I didn’t know your favorite color. Well, I guess it just never came up. What’s yours? Orange. - Orange. - Yeah. Yeah, I prefer the burnt tones. I did not expect that. - That one. - This one. Okay. You know, you guys make a very cute couple. Where are we off to now? Off to Frankie’s to get a cake, of course. - Stephanie! - Frankie. It’s been too long. I know. Last summer I was in Antigua, researching the indigenous people of the Arawak. As one does. Hey, I saw that your parents listed their house. Yeah, they already have an offer. - Wow. - Mm-hmm. Oh, this is my fiancé Ben. Fiancé? Nice meeting you, Ben. Nice to meet you too. It smells amazing in here. Well, you have to have a sample. Frankie used to spoil us with her samples when we were little. Well, you and your sister were my favorite customers. Now, these are our newest creation. Okay. Thanks. Mmm! What do you think? Oh, my gosh, that’s so good. No wonder we’re getting the cake from here. Cake? For your wedding? No, for Tracy and Preston. They got engaged at the same time, but their wedding is first on the Fourth of July. Oh, that’s wonderful! Wait. Do you mean this Fourth of July? Yes. We’re backed up on orders for months. I’m so sorry, but that's the busiest time of the year. Oh, no. Little Frankie would be so disappointed if she knew we couldn’t get the wedding cake here. Well, I would never disappoint Little Frankie. Let me go check the order book. I’ll see what I can do. Little Frankie! Um, who’s Little Frankie? When I was like 10 or so, I wanted an extra cookie, so I told her that I would name one of my kids after her. - Good to know. - Yeah, so take note. Number four or five has to be named Frankie. Wait, you want four or five kids? Try five or six. You knew that. I did not know that. How many do you want? I don’t know. One, maybe two. - Really? That’s it? - Yeah. I was an only child. I came from a small family. Okay, I’m not supposed to do this, but I’ve moved things around, and I will personally see that your cake gets done. Thank you so much. Tracy’s gonna be very excited. Making some progress on our to-do list. Yeah. Have you given any thought to our plan B for the wedding? - Not yet. You? - Nah. I was so focused on the proposal, I hadn’t thought much about our next steps. What? I just got an email from James Quincy. Another riveting article on emerging markets? The guy they hired for the Oxford spot just dropped out. Apparently they’re going over my application from last year. - Wait, really? - This is amazing. What does this mean? That I have another shot at the job. I could be teaching and doing research at the Oxford School of Economics. Under your hero. I can’t even believe I have this opportunity. Well, what does this mean for us? We move to England. I can’t move to England. I’m about to make tenure, and you know how rare that is for a professor my age. I can’t just walk away. Right, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to jump ahead like that. You know, when I applied, I hadn’t met you yet. I don’t wanna be responsible for you missing something like this. We don’t have to talk about this right now. They already passed on me once. I’m sure there's hundreds of candidates more qualified than me, so I doubt they’d even offer it to me. Maybe, but none more hard-working or talented than you. Thank you. I just wanna be spending some time with my girl. - We can do that. - Yeah. Ooh! So close. Maybe next time. I can’t wait for you all to see my wedding dress. You know, I really lucked out. Only a few alterations, and it will be ready. We successfully picked out your cake and invitations, so creating your dream wedding in four weeks? No problem. Ah-ah-ah. There’s still a lot to do. Don’t jinx us. Mom, don’t worry. We’ve got this. Yes! You guys win again. Rematch later? Always. All right, come and get it! Here we go. Ribs a la Robert. Ah, and my famous corn on the cob. - My favorite. - Ooh-whee! All right. This smells amazing, Mr. Bishop. Ah, it’s the slow roast method. The longer it waits, the better it is. Should I be at all concerned that the fire extinguisher is so close to the grill? - Dad? - It’s always been there. When the girls were little, Stephanie would use the grill to roast her marshmallows. We never had to use it, but let’s just say we had a few close calls. I didn’t like to wait. It’s always faster if you just catch '’em on fire and blow it out. I’m with her. Can you tell me more about Stephanie as a young kid? She was a little bit of a troublemaker. That is not true. Yes, it is true. Don’t you remember the time you gave all my dolls a haircut? It was trendy. Or the time we had to go to the ER when you thought it was wise to jump off the roof with an umbrella after seeing Mary Poppins. Tracy was our practical daughter. Stephanie, she always moved to the beat of her own drum. AKA Tracy was more responsible. Now, I didn’t say that. Hey, I’ll take it. Because I’m so responsible, I met Preston. Oh, how'd you guys meet? It’s my first day of law school, very first class, and I read the syllabus the wrong way and showed up with the wrong textbook. I look over, and this beautiful girl is just watching me scramble. She reaches out, hands me the correct book, and that was that. I cannot believe you had an extra textbook. To be fair, I had two textbooks because there were two different editions, and I didn’t know which one the professor would teach from. Been together ever since. So what about you two? Was it love at first sight? It was. For me, at least. I mean, from the moment she gave me a handful of tissues to clean the coffee I just spilled all over myself. And for me, it was that he didn’t seem that upset at all. Well, it was iced coffee. I met Eleanore in second grade. Well, that’s incredible. Yep. Knew her nine years before I even asked her out. Twenty-two before we were engaged. That is a long time. I think we knew each other better than we knew ourselves. Built a solid friendship first, then the romance came. And we had the same values, the same vision for the future. That’s the important thing. Yes, hey, but that was our story. Everybody’s story is different. And our Stephanie has always moved at a faster pace. And it’s worked out so far. Pass the salad, please. Who’s ready for some of this, huh? Okay, who’s next? Well, we gotta find a great spot for Sam and Gary. - How about table four? - Great. Seating chart? Yeah, it’s a bit tricky though, as we’re doing it based on the save-the-date responses, but we gotta get a jump on it. Hey, have you seen Stephanie? She’s outside marking where the tables will go. Oh, when was that taken? Let’s see, I was 17, so Stephanie was 15. It’s definitely the awkward years. Like you had awkward years. No. The only reason that we’re not having a slideshow at the wedding is because I had braces and headgear for three years. She still has that beautiful smile. Look, anyway, I will let you guys get back to the chart. Good luck with that. Uh, nope, we gotta have one less at table five. I just got an email earlier from my cousin Timothy that he already has Fourth of July plans, so he won’t be able to make it. There’s another one of my family members who’s not able to come. But the important thing is that your grandma is coming, and she’s sitting right here, front and center. That’s true. - Did you just splash me? - What if I did? Okay, all right, truce. Truce? All right. Can I ask you something? Anything. Do you worry that people think we moved too fast? By "people," do you mean my dad? Yeah. He keeps dropping these not-so-subtle hints about us waiting, taking things slower. I know. I’m trying to just let it go. Just don’t want people thinking we made a snap decision. I don’t want you thinking that. That’s why, uh... I thought a lot about this. Of course I don’t. And I don’t want you to think that me saying yes was, okay? Okay. Don’t you do it. Pretty sure we called a truce. We called a truce, are you kidding me? Cheers. I’m so glad that we're finally all doing a double date. And we should go to the Fourth of July Jamboree together too. Oh, yeah, the jamboree. Tracy and Stephanie get pretty into it. That’s because it's fun. - This place is so cute. - Right? I heard good things about the band, and apparently they play weddings. Yes! I’ve been looking forward to hearing them. So, Ben, what’s your go-to music? - Punk underground. - Really? Yeah, I did my undergrad at Oxford, and I kinda got wrapped up in the whole scene. I didn’t know you lived in England. - Did you like it? - Oh, I loved it, yeah. Hoping to go back someday, if the timing were right. Well, at least your music taste is better than Stephanie’s here. She loves techno. Oh, yeah. I’ve learned to embrace that one. It’s fun to dance to. I don’t know about that. Pretty good to work out to though. Oh, my gosh, is that Dave Robinson? - That is Dave Robinson. - Is this his band? - Must be. - Did you guys know? - No, of course not. - The Dave you were engaged to? - That Dave? - A very long time ago. I like Dave. Hey, Dave! Stop! Preston, no. Dave. Stephanie Bishop. He’s coming. - No way. - Hi, Dave. Hey, long time, no see. What are you doing here? My parents have a vacation house here. Ah, I remember that, yeah. Never got the invite. Is this your band? Yeah, for now. Till something better comes along. You remember Tracy and Preston, right? Yeah, of course. You guys are still together. You should be married with kids by now. Actually, I just got engaged. Congrats. And this is my fiancé Ben. Fiancé. Hopefully you guys make it further than we did, huh? We will. So how'd you guys meet? Los Angeles College, where we teach. You became a professor. Wow, that’s... that's great. Archeology. Anthropology. Ah, close enough, right? Not really. Well, I’m gonna finish setting up, but, man, it was really good to see you, Steph. You too. Don’t judge me on these guys. They won’t let me play my original stuff, so... See you, Dave. You okay? Yeah. All I’m saying is I kinda liked the band. We could at least see if they’re available. No, that would be so weird. I don’t want that guy at our wedding in any capacity. I don’t think that you would’ve gone to grad school or got your doctorate if you guys stayed together. It’s true. Him leaving you was the best thing that could've happened. Wait, he left you? Could you just give us a minute? Yeah, we’ll meet you at the car. Thanks. So we dated freshman year, and the band that he was with at the time asked him to go on tour, so he proposed, and I thought it would be so cool to be engaged to a rock star, and I said yes. My mom and dad were not thrilled when I told them that I was gonna drop out of school and follow him, so they talked me out of it, thank goodness. And then he never came back. But it all worked out because I was able to figure out what I wanted to do with my life. So we have your parents to thank. Yes, my parents were right. It wasn’t until he was gone that I realized how much he was holding me back. I’d like to think I would've figured it out at some point. But I’m glad I went through all of that because it led me to you. Wow. This a 1955 Thunderbird? It sure is. I didn’t know you had this in here. This is stunning. My pride and joy. I may have to sell it soon to pay for all these weddings. Oh, you don’t have to do that. Stephanie and I said we’d pay for it ourselves. You don’t think I can pay for my daughter’s wedding? What? No, no, no. I just mean that, you know, you don’t have to, if you don’t want to. Not a traditional guy, huh? I am with some things. Not in paying for the wedding or, say, asking my permission before proposing. So Thunderbird, huh? Where'd you get her? My dad used to own one. Few years ago, I found this one online. - Been restoring it. - Does it run? Almost. I restored it with all original parts, but I still need an idler arm. Can’t find an authentic one anywhere, and I don’t wanna risk putting something in that wasn’t made specifically for this model, so still on the hunt. Do you mind if I take a look? - Yeah, sure. - Thanks. You got a 292 cubic inch OHV. You got a 292 wide block V8 engine. This is all first of its kind stuff, sir. I didn’t realize you’re into classic cars. - My dad was a mechanic. - Ah. Some of my best memories are him picking me up from school, taking me to the shop, showing me all the cool cars. But this? This was my favorite. All Thunderbirds. Is that all original interior as well? Oh, yeah, you bet. Here, come, come. Come sit. - Really? - Yeah. Check it out. Ohh! Ohh! Now this is how a car’s supposed to feel. Ben, you should hit the green with Preston and me tomorrow before the food tasting. I would love to hit the green with you guys. You’re talking about golf, right? Yes. But I have to warn you I’m not very good, seeing as I’ve actually never played before. That’s all right. You seem like a sharp guy. I’m sure you'll pick it up in no time. Hope so. Why are you smiling? Your dad just asked me to play golf with him tomorrow. That’s great. I’m pretty sure we just bonded. I knew you would. He did make a comment about me not asking his permission before I proposed. Hmm. I didn’t even really consider that. He’s kind of old school, but he can be swayed. When I told him that I was taking a year off between high school and college, I thought he’d freak out, but after a six-hour conversation about my future, he was totally cool. Don’t worry. It’s an archaic tradition. Trust me, I would know. Who wants some fresh lemonade? Oh, yes, thank you. That is amazing. Isn’t it? It’s the cucumber. My secret weapon. Hey, Steph, did you look at the photographers that I sent you? Yes, I think we should go with this one, since your first choice is hard to get in touch with. You know what, I’m gonna leave this to you guys. I’m gonna go watch some YouTube videos - on how to hit a golf ball. - Good luck. I like him. Me too. Setting the bar high like always, sir. My axis is slightly off. Couldn’t tell. Your downswing was perfect. Yeah, great downswing. Hey, did you ask for Robert’s permission before you proposed to Tracy? I did. You didn’t, I presume? I honestly didn’t even think about it. I mean, we’re not that close, and Stephanie’s more modern with that kind of stuff. He didn’t say anything to you, did he? - No. - Okay, good. I figure that’s why he’s being so rough on me. Hey, look, he was rough on me, too, when I first started dating Tracy, but just give him a little while. He’ll warm up. What’s a little while? About six years. Hey, you’re up, Ben! Oh, hey, I wouldn’t go with that one. - No? - You don’t wanna go with a high iron on this first drive. You want a driver. Yeah, here you go. Driver. - Thank you. - Yeah. Here we go. Easy peasy. Sorry. Okay. Look, golf is a game of time, patience, and precision. Try looking at the ball the entire time. Okay. Wha... I-I’m so sorry. I have no idea what happened. That was my dad’s favorite club. Are you serious? Sir, I’ll go get it right now. I am so sorry. Careful not to swallow any of that water. No clue what’s in it. Ben, Ben, Ben, Ben. Stop, stop, I’m kidding. It’s an old set from a yard sale. You don’t have to go in there. All right. I’m so sorry. I didn’t think you’d really go in. May not be a great golfer, but you’ve got, uh, zest. - Gonna be a long day. - Mm-hmm. It’s all right. And you’re sure that we can't just have one of everything? We do have to narrow it down a little bit. I wanted you all here to get your feedback, so please be honest. Well, of the salads, I’m liking the spinach goat cheese. - That’s a really good dressing. - Okay. Oh, my dear, I think the mixed spring greens with the crumbled bleu cheese is the way to go. I don’t know. I think that the simple iceberg with bacon is always the best choice. So everyone likes something different. Great. That should make things easier. Salads are the safe choice for appetizers, but if this was my wedding, I’d do the coconut shrimp. Yeah, me too. I mean, it’s really good. Oh, but, honey, you have to have a salad at a wedding. Why? Can’t mix it up? Because there’s a reason for traditions, like having salad before a meal. Yeah, sure. I mean, because, you know, that’s what people expect. Thoughts on main dishes. Chicken, hands down. I say pot roast. The sauce on top is incredible. No! I know pot roast. I... I make an old family recipe every Christmas. Girls, you have to admit mine’s way better. Oh, yeah, how do you make it? Sorry, Ben, secret recipe. Only for family members. Well, then I guess you’re gonna have to let me know pretty soon. We’ll see how it goes. - Dad! - Robert! I’m kidding! Excuse me real quick. I have to take this. Well, we should probably eat the rest of the food. We don’t want it to go to waste. You just want the rest of mine, don’t you? - Are you serious? - If you don’t want it. Okay, take the rest of this too. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, thank you so much. Okay. Preston will finish all of them. The shrimp was so good. Who was it? That was James Quincy. He just offered me the job at Oxford. That is great. Wow. Congratulations. Thank you, sir. Okay, so how many chairs does that package come with? So can we do half the amount for a little less of the cost? I see. Okay, thank you. I’ll let you know. Everything okay? I never realized how complicated chair and table rentals could be. Well, you think you’ll have time for a little break? I’d love to talk. I’d love a break. Good, '’cause I have the perfect place. Where? It’s a surprise. Hmm. Intriguing. Ben, you did all this? I did. Tracy mentioned it, and I figured this was the perfect spot. What’s all this for? Us. I figured we could talk about the job offer and just get away for a minute. Have a seat. - Thank you. - Yeah. So did you find out when you have to give your decision? I did. Two weeks. July third. That’s right before the wedding. If I did take the job, would you come with me? Me moving to England would be such a fun adventure, and there’s a part of me that would say yes in a heartbeat. But I’m scared. If I leave my job, I have to start all over. I’ve built this great career at Los Angeles College that no one really expected. And I can’t let that go. I have to see it through. I won’t take the job. Then there’s that other side. I can’t live with myself if I know you didn’t take it because of me. What if we don’t talk about it right now? I have two weeks before I have to give them an answer, and it is a beautiful day. It’s a beautiful lake. A beautiful woman. This decision won’t just go away. I know but maybe we don’t have to make a decision right this second. We can hold off, and maybe it’ll change if we don’t harp on it. I think I can try to do that. - Yeah? - Yeah. Besides, we’ve got some fun stuff coming up. Got the jamboree. Oh, yes, I cannot wait for this jamboree. Please tell me there’s a charcuterie plate in there. Oh, you mean this? I love you. I love you too. I wish I could tell him to stay, forget about the job. - So why don’t you? - I’m worried he'll listen. And then later, when it’s too late, he’ll realize what he missed out on. Should I just go with him? I don’t think that there’s an easy answer here. What are you ladies talking about? Nothing. Today is a fun day. No stress. No talking about the wedding or England. That’s gonna be a little difficult, considering this is an Independence Day celebration, and England had a little something to do with that. You know what I mean. Look at this. Guess how many jelly beans to win a free dinner. There’s at least 200 in there. What? No. There’s over a thousand. Hey, how many are you putting? I’m not telling. Fine. See, Ben? Isn’t this fun? - Be honest. - It is. It’s my first jamboree. This was always Tracy and I’s favorite part of the summer. Especially the balloon pop. Yes, the balloon pop. We have to do that. - What is the balloon pop? - Don’t ask. Preston's just bitter because we always win. I always let you win! Tracy, that sounds like a challenge. It does sound like a challenge. - We accept. - Good. So the team that pops the most balloons after throwing all the darts wins. Sounds easy enough. Not as easy as you think. Boys versus girls? Oh, it’s on. Careful, Ben, the Bishop girls get very competitive. We’ll see. Ladies first. - Yeah! - Okay, lucky shot. Where is this coming from? Played a lot of darts in college. Wait till you see Tracy’s arm at the dunk tank. You guys put up a good fight. We didn’t stand a chance, did we? You guys won every game at the jamboree. That’s how we roll. Well, at least we didn’t come out totally empty-handed. Ben won. In Constitution trivia. Yeah, and he got that super cool flag. Which makes no sense at an Independence Day celebration. - Maybe it’s a sign. - Maybe. Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention, please? The winner of the guess the number of jelly beans contest with a guess of 1,776 is... Tracy Bishop! 1776! Of course! - Redheads? No way. - Yes. I’m telling you, there’s no way. Studies have shown that a significant amount of Neanderthals were redheads. All right, yeah, and who’s doing these studies? Scientists. Okay, I got it. You okay? No. That was our firm on the phone. They’ve been trying to reach us all day. Apparently there was an issue with the paperwork Preston and I submitted for the case we were just working on before we left. Now we have to go refile back in San Francisco ASAP, or our client could go into bankruptcy. What? Don’t they know you’re on vacation, or that you’re planning your wedding? It doesn’t matter. It has to get done. So what are you gonna do? Preston's looking up flights right now. I’m hoping we can sort it out in a day or two. But that means I need you to take over all of the planning. Of course. Whatever you need. Thanks. You’re a lifesaver. Mom says she and Dad will help out too. The most important thing is that my dress needs to be picked up tomorrow. - Done. - We also have to figure out - something with centerpieces. - On it. And make sure that all of the rentals are arriving on time. No problem. Thank you so much. Mom said it would be a lot for you to handle, but I told her that you got this. - Hi. Welcome. - Hi. I’m Becky. Would you like to try that on? Oh, no, thank you. I’m actually here picking up for my sister, Tracy Bishop. Yes! It just came in. - I’ll go grab it. - Thanks. I’m so glad we were able to get it sized correctly in time. - Wow, it’s stunning. - It is. And so is the one you have in your hand there. Huge misconception in my line of work that only brides-to-be can try dresses on. Well, ironically I am also a bride-to-be. - Even better! - I shouldn’t. Lots to do, and I don’t even have a date picked out yet. No date means no pressure. That’s the best way to try these things on. True. And in Roman times, the bridesmaids were actually required to wear the same dress as the bride to pose as decoys in case enemy kingdoms or evil spirits tried kidnapping the bride. So really it’s tradition. Oh, I’m an anthropology professor. Oh, okay. That makes more sense. Yes. I mean, I guess I could try one on. What’s the harm in that? See, I like this one. The neckline and the waist, it’s exactly what I want. You look beautiful. Hmm. - Trying on dresses already. - Hi, Mom. I was picking up Tracy’s, and I got a little carried away. It fits you perfectly. It does, doesn’t it? I love it. You look beautiful, honey. Why don’t we go get an iced coffee? What do you say? Sure. I’ll go change. Just don’t want you to rush into this marriage, at least until we find out where Ben’s job is gonna take him and where that leaves you both. Mom, I’m not like everybody else in this family, and I don’t plan things right away, but that doesn’t mean I don’t know what I want. Sweetheart, you’ve only known Ben for six months. Marriage is for life. It’s okay to take your time. Maybe we did jump in a little quickly, and we didn’t think out every single future decision, but I have never been so sure of anything in my life. I just don’t want it to be like with Dave, with you wanting to follow him without thinking things through. I don’t wanna see you get hurt. This is a completely different situation, and I’ve grown so much since then. You’re right. You have. And I am so proud of the woman you’ve become. But you’re still my baby girl, and I reserve the right to worry. And you also need to trust that I can make my own choices, like getting engaged, moving to England. Ben is a good guy, and I can see how much you care for each other. Just promise me when you’re making those choices that you’ll think about what’s right for you, too, '’cause that's what’s gonna be best for both of you. I promise. That dress was gorgeous. - Wasn’t it? - Oh, my God. I love it. Hey, how’s it going? Not good. Things are snowballing. And Preston just received some really bad news. - Oh, no, what happened? - His grandmother fell, and she’s not gonna be able to make it to the wedding. Oh, my God, that’s horrible. I know, and he was so looking forward to her being there. When do you guys think you’ll be here? Hopefully soon. Look, I know you’re already doing a million things. I haven’t received confirmation from the florist yet. Can you go check on the order? Absolutely. First thing tomorrow. Okay, thanks. You’re a lifesaver. Of course. Good luck. Thanks. Love you. Love you. Give Preston my love too. Bye. But my sister placed the order on the website two weeks ago. I am so sorry. I’m not seeing anything under that name. Could it be under Preston? We just updated our website. It might just be an unfortunate glitch. - What were you looking for? - We’re doing red rose bouquets. Oh, that shouldn’t be a problem. Let me start a new order. Now, when’s the wedding? July Fourth. This year? Yes. That’s next week. Technically, six days. I’m not sure we can fill such a big order in such short time. That’s why she placed the order two weeks ago. Right. Hmm. Let me see what I can do. Thank you. Of course Tracy puts me in charge, and it’s already falling apart. It’s not falling apart. It’s a minor hiccup. I just feel like this wedding is getting closer and closer by the minute. I know. And so is this decision you have to make about the job. I know. - We need to discuss it soon. - And we will, as soon as we finish all the wedding errands, okay? We probably won’t be able to do all roses. Are you okay with other flowers? Yeah, we’re going with red, white, and blue, so as long as they’re red. We can totally do that. Ranunculus, sugarbushes, dahlias, anthurium, peonies. There are so many beautiful flowers that come in red. Great. Hey, it may even be better than plain roses anyway. Problem solved. One problem solved. Stephanie, Ben! Hi, Frankie! Tracy’s cake is looking great. Oh, that’s so good to hear. Come decorate some Fourth of July tarts. We really shouldn’t. We still have so much to do. I think we can make time. Plus, they smell amazing. Okay, why not? Why, uh, why tarts? This was the favorite food of our founding fathers. That actually makes sense because raspberry tarts were very popular in the late 1700s. Decorate. Oh, you both started with the same color icing. A sign it’s meant to be. All right. What are you making? The original flag with the stars for the original colonies. - I love it. - What about you? Obviously a very detailed portrait of Thomas Jefferson with spiky hair. So the chairs will be in rows over here. And where’s the band gonna go? Well, there’s no band, but the DJ will be over here. - Ah. - Oh, hi! You guys can put those on the side of the house for storage. Thank you. It’s coming along great. I’m very proud of you. For being able to direct people where to store chairs? No, no, because, uh... well, for helping your sister plan this wedding, for, uh, for being on track for tenure. For just being an amazing daughter. Thanks, Dad. You deserve the best. Always. Are you talking about Ben? Look, Stephanie, the first date I ever took your mom on was to grab a cheeseburger at a diner when we were just teenagers. Oh, I was worried it wasn’t nice enough, not good enough for someone as special as she was, but it was all I could afford. Your mom didn’t care at all. She loved it. Anyway, we spent that whole date talking plans for our future, dreaming about things we wanted out of life, and we quickly discovered we pretty much wanted the same things. I left knowing I’d marry her. Years later, after I’d become a doctor, I took her to this very fancy restaurant for our 15th anniversary. She looked at the menu and was sad. There were no cheeseburgers on it. She asked if we could leave and go back to the diner where we had our first date. I asked her why. She told me the cheeseburger reminded her that we had, in fact, made our lives what we wanted together. I like that. If you love someone you wanna spend the rest of your life with, the only thing that matters is that you have the same vision for the future. Well, why on earth did you wait so long to marry her after that first date? Seems like you could've eloped that night. Stephanie... that is not at all the point I was trying to make. I know. My point is that you knew Mom was the woman for you right away, and I know that Ben is the man for me. He’s so kind and thoughtful. We laugh every day, and he cheers me on in every part of my life. So you may think that this is fast, but in 10 years or 20 or 30, whatever, he’s the one I wanna have the cheeseburger with. Well, everything seems to be coming in on time, which is a good sign. Just talked to Tracy, and they are wrapping things up. They’ll be home tomorrow, so we are on track. I know she’s so grateful to you for taking over. Well, I know she’d do the same if the tables were reversed. Hello? Oh, my gosh. Tell her congratulations. No, I totally understand. Thanks for letting me know. The photographer can’t make it anymore. - Oh, no. - What happened? She had a baby. What? Okay, um... - We’ll find another one. - Four days out? Do you know how hard it was to book her? If anybody can do it, you can. I’m sure they're out there. Okay, I’ll help you look. Yeah, this July Fourth. Yes, as in four days from now. Hello? Yeah, so it’d just be for the basic package. Great. The wedding is this Tuesday. Oh, you’re already booked. Okay, thank you. Hey, have you tried this guy? Renaldo Salks. Says he’s the best wedding photographer in Palm Springs. Oh, yeah, I tried him a couple weeks ago before we booked this other one, but his messages were full, and I couldn’t get through. Well, his social media says he’s working an engagement party tomorrow at the country club. It’s too bad we can’t go ask him. Why can’t we? Uh, because we’re not invited. Just act like you’ve been invited and nobody knows the difference. Why do I feel like you’ve crashed a party before? It was a long time ago, and I was writing a dissertation. Okay. Relax your shoulders a bit. Oh, there he is. Can I get you to... Yeah, beautiful. Smile a little bit. Yeah! Okay, so what’s the plan? We’re just gonna wing it. He’s gonna work his way through the guests, and then we wait for our chance to talk to him. Okay, and what do we do till then? Enjoy a party we didn’t have to plan. I like that. You’re right. When you act like you belong, no one even notices. It’s a bizarre human trait. Listen, about the job... Before you say anything, I’ve been thinking about it, and I want you to take it. What about you? Lovely couple. May I take your picture? - You may. - Yes... if we can ask you a question. I don’t use filters, if that’s your question. No, that’s not it. Are you available to shoot a wedding on the Fourth of July? This Fourth of July, as in a few days from now? Yes, here in Palm Springs at our vacation home. Are you friends of John or Ellie? Um... Neither. I don’t understand. Well, we weren’t able to get in touch with you, and we knew you’d be here. I think this is the first time I’ve been stalked for my services. Flattered? A little scared. It’s for my sister. Our photographer had a baby and can’t make it, and we are desperate. Normally I’d say no because this is weird, but since you’ve gone to all this trouble of tracking me down, and you’ve been at this party for half an hour without being noticed, I guess okay. - Yes! - Thank you so much! Thank you. You’re welcome. Better not take any photos of you at this. Yeah, it’s probably best you don’t. People are starting to stare, so we should probably head out. Thank you again. You’re welcome. Thank you. May I take your photo? - You’re back! - Oh, hey. Yes, finally. Every time we were close to finishing, something else came up. Where were you guys? Oh, you know, just getting Renaldo Salks to photograph your wedding. - No way. - That’s great. But what about the other photographer? She had a baby, but the important thing is that we are on track with everything for the wedding. I know. It’s so incredible. Oh, you’re the best. See, now you wanna keep your shoulders, waist, and knees all parallel to the ground so that when you swing, you get the full momentum of the twist. - Okay. - Okay? Okay. Better, nice. Now just make sure that you curve that club around your body. You don’t hit the club straight in order to make the ball go straight. - Okay. - All right. Hey, I appreciate your help. If Robert actually ever invites me back out, I wanna show off my golfing skills and not my ability to chuck a club into the lake. Of course. Besides, it helps keep my mind off things, so... The wedding? Yeah. Is everything okay? No, not exactly. Cold feet? No, no, it’s nothing like that. I can’t wait to marry Tracy, but once I found out that my grandma couldn’t make it, along with pretty much half of my family, I started to wonder if we should have the wedding now at all. I wanna share the most important day of my life with the ones that I love, and I know that Tracy has her heart set on having this wedding here at the vacation house and... I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to dump this all on you. I just don’t know what to do. Look, it’s fine. I get it. I’d say your best bet is just go talk to Tracy. Tell her how you’re feeling. But she is so excited about this wedding. I can’t ask her not to have it. Look, you love each other, right? Then she’ll understand how important it is. What? Just realizing I should be taking my own advice. I have to give an answer on the job tomorrow, and Stephanie and I have a lot to talk about. I’m just not sure what jewelry to wear with the dress. You should do an earring. Dad, can you get that? You guys expecting more deliveries? Not until tomorrow. Hi. Oh, thank you, thank you. Has my name on it. Did you order something? Nope. - Can’t be. - What is it? It’s the idler arm I need for my Thunderbird. Who sent it to you? There’s a note. "Robert, Ben told me you could use one of these. Enjoy. Thomas Larson." That’s Ben's dad. Ben did this. Told you he was thoughtful. I can’t believe he did this for me. This looks beautiful. Thank you. Thank you. I can’t believe that guessing the right number of jelly beans in a jar got us a dinner here. I’m glad it did. It gives us a chance to take a step back from work and from... From wedding planning. Tracy... I wanna talk to you about the wedding. Give it a try. Oh, you bet your life. That sounds good. Thanks to you. I’m gonna take it for a spin. You wanna come along? Stephanie and I have some stuff to do, but maybe later. All right, later it is. Enjoy! Bye-bye. You know you just validated his obsession, right? Oh, you mean his hobby. Same thing. Look, I have to tell Quincy an answer tomorrow, so we should probably talk about it. I’ll go to England with you. I was gonna tell you I’m not gonna take the job, but you would move to England? You don’t wanna take the job? No, I do. To work with Quincy would be a highlight of my career, but without you, then it doesn’t mean anything. You would really move? I would for you. I can’t ask you to do that. I know how hard you’ve worked for everything, and I couldn’t live with myself if I knew I made you give it all up. Maybe if we’d been together for a couple years and were actually on the same page about what we wanted, but we haven’t even talked about this. And we don’t actually know if we want the same amount of kids. Maybe we did rush into this. So what now? You take the job, and I stay here. And us? Put a pin in it, take a break. You could really do that? If it meant you following your dreams. And you following yours. Glad I caught you before you left. Mr. Bishop, what are you doing here? Thought I’d take another drive in the T-Bird, brought me here. Which brings me to my next point. What are you doing here? Stephanie thought this was for the best. When Stephanie was a little girl, she dug a hole in the wall and thought the fiberglass insulation was cotton candy and that it led to a magical land, so no, Stephanie doesn’t always know what’s best. She thought I’d be happy taking my dream job, but Stephanie doesn’t realize that I can’t be happy without her in my life. Then I think there’s something you’ve been meaning to ask me. My blessing to marry my daughter. I didn’t think you liked me, Mr. Bishop. Isn’t about time you called me Robert? Look, I admit I... I didn’t get you at first. But now I see how thoughtful you are about my daughter, how you put her needs before your own, how you went above and beyond to get me a little car part. Bottom line, I’ve never seen Stephanie smile more than when she’s with you. And I wish we could be together. Sometimes when I’m working on the car, and it’s just not doing what I want it to, I stop, I breathe, I look at it from a different angle, try to see my other options. There’s always another way to go about things. Parked in a loading zone. I’d better get going. So anyway, you have it. Have what? My blessing. For whenever you need it. Thank you, Robert. All aboard. Take care. You’re up early. Couldn’t sleep. There’s something that I have to tell you. - Me too. - Do you wanna go first? No, you go. Preston and I are calling off the wedding. What? Preston doesn’t wanna get married unless all of his family can be there, especially his grandmother. And I agree. I was just on such a whirlwind with getting the wedding ready in time. I never realized how he was feeling till last night. I get it. It’d be really hard to get married without all the people that you love most there. Thank you for being so understanding. I know you’ve worked so hard on this wedding, and I was terrified to tell you that it’s off. I have to follow my heart. Where’s Ben? At the bus station. Why? What happened? I told him to take the job and to put a pin in us. Stephanie, you and I both know you’re supposed to be with Ben. - Go after him. - I can’t. I have to let him go after what he wants. Do you love him? With all my heart. I’ve seen the way that he talks about you, the way he looks at you. You think some job is more important than what the two of you have? It just all happened too fast. I didn’t even know his favorite color until a couple weeks ago. Who cares about that? That’s not important, and you know it. I can’t give up what I've been working for for some guy. I didn’t do it with Dave, and I’m not gonna do it now. Ben is not some guy, and he is definitely not Dave. You need to ask yourself what is best for you and Ben as a couple. You need to be honest with each other. I wanna be. Well? What is your heart telling you? He wasn’t at the bus stop. I missed him. Maybe check outside? Why? Trust me. Hello, beautiful. Hi. So I just got off the phone with Quincy, and I told him that I’m not taking the position. But I did pitch him a new one. One where I can stay in LA, do my research, and for once a year for a couple of weeks, I go to Oxford, and I teach my findings. And I thought for those couple weeks, maybe... that you’d come with me, as long as I schedule it over the summer. I like this plan. What'd he say? He said he thought it would work. And as far as kids go, we’ll figure it out. Maybe I’ll want six kids. Maybe I could just do four with like two dogs. I don’t care how long we’ve known each other or that we don’t know every single thing about each other yet because, Stephanie, what we have is real, and it’s lasting. I’m here for you, and I wanna be here for you for the rest of my life '’cause my only dream is you. So I’m gonna ask you a familiar question that’s all about what you want, not what you think is right or what you think is best for me. Do you think you could answer it honestly? Mm-hmm. Stephanie, will you still marry me? With all my heart. What is this? Stephanie, I wanna give this to you. Mom bought it for you. With it comes a wedding. A perfect Fourth of July dream wedding. Are you sure? It’s your wedding. It always really was. Well, I guess I’m gonna have to get my parents on the next flight out. Yeah! Hey. Good luck. Thank you, sir. You may now all be seated. Ben... you are my everything. I am so lucky that I found you, and there’s no one else I’d rather grow old with. I know what I want. It’s you. Now and forever. Stephanie... no matter what roadblocks come our way, I will always support and love you. You are the most amazing woman that I ever met. I’m so lucky that I found you. Thank you.
