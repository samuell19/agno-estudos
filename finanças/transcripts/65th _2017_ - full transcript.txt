Had the whole house smellin' like old socks. Tiana, baby. Where Lester wanna go tonight? I don't know. Probably to one of his semi-pro football games. I thought he was injured. He is, Auntie. He just wants to go support his team. Well, you know what they say about women in the locker room? What? Wait weaken legs. Mama. Hoo Lisa, you stop now. What, I'm just sayin', you cute. That's probably why Lester stutters now. Auntie, stop. And the way you clean them greens earlier, girl, you better focus on your leg weakening skills. Oh, shit! Oh, God. God bless America. Mama, you okay? You all right? Yeah, it's just a little knick. Why you blessin' America? 'Cause we been trumped. Shut up, Lisa. I'm tryin' not to cuss.

You got your phone taken away again. Daddy! How's my favorite girls? - Hey, Daddy. - Hey, hey baby girl. How you doin'?

Hey y'all come over here so I can bless the table. I can't wait to eat. Starvin'. Thank You so much, Lord Jesus, for this food we're about to receive. I ask that you bless it for the nourishment of our body. In Jesus' name we pray, amen. Amen. Yeah, so baby girl. I heard you helped with the dinner. Yeah, Daddy. I put my foot in them greens. Literally. Horrible. Wait. Like green mashed potaters. Nuh uh. You ain't even tasted 'em yet. Put some gravy... Aw. Watch. I promise you. Hey Lisa. Thank you, Mommy. These greens don't get eat? What doesn't kill you will only make you stronger. You got that right. Really? Y'all gotta quit hatin' on my A-one cooking skills, okay? A-one, day one. She means F-one. She's so determined. Tiana knows she just cannot cook. Think her cornbread will be good? Mmm hmm. Is your rice burnt like it was last time? You know you can't cook, girl. Have you ever heard of the new game Pokemon Go? Poke a who? Tiana, what's she talkin' 'bout? I don't know. It's like this app or something and well, you gotta like, pick up the creatures or something like that, but it's stupid, though. Well, you're half right. I don't know, maybe a quarter. All right, Myra, explain it to me. Once you download the game, you have to... Myra. It does this... Where's Bear Bear? Steven, can you let her eat dinner first? Please? Okay. Myra, I asked you a question. Where's Bear Bear? He's... He's gone. Steven. Not now, please. What do you mean, gone? Gone where? Myra. Tiana. Lisa. Am I talking to myself? Can somebody please explain to me what's goin' on? Steven, look. Something happened in the back yard earlier and when we... What's goin' on around here? Everybody can't talk all of the sudden. When I ask questions in my house, I expect an answer! Esther! Steven, what? You didn't check the security cameras? What security cameras? The security cameras. You asked me to install them last week when the neighbor house got vandalized? Baby, Darren came by last week when we were out of town and he installed them for us, remember that? Oh, okay, I'm sorry. Yeah, that must have slipped my mind. Wait, how many did you put in? One in the back, one in the front, two in the house. In the house? Yes, in the house. Who the hell's been messin' with this? Myra, you been messin' with my laptop again? Steven, I'm not too comfortable with the cameras bein' in the house now. Look. You see that? Okay, okay, okay but still. In the house, babe? Nah, unh uh. You're not comfortable with cameras bein' in the house? The goddamn dog's in pieces. Steven! Steven! Steven! Aunt, Auntie. You better go, too, honey. I'll be right behind you. Steven! How do you forget there's security cameras? What? Okay, but Steven. Wait a minute. What are you doin'? It's some strange shit goin' on. Steven. The girls. Esther, look. Something strange is going on here. Okay, dogs just don't up and disappear. But what you goin' do? Go shoot up the whole neighborhood? Yes, if I have to, I will. Oh. Okay, so you just gonna shoot everybody then, huh? Look, somebody disrespected me by comin' in my backyard and killin' my daughter's dog! Steven. Baby. I'm sorry. I have a family to protect. So right now, I don't feel safe. Listen. It's not much you can do with those guns, anyway because they don't... Hello? Hey, look man, I kinda got a little situation. All right, all right. All right man, I'll be in a second, bye. Who was that? That was Darren. Somebody hit a pole on West Oakland off Broadster Street. Power lines are down. But Dad, you just got home. I'm scared. Yeah, you didn't even get to eat, and I cooked. Well, I helped. Hey, you know Daddy has a great crew. I'll be home in a second. I'ma eat those greens, all right? You guys goin' be safe. I have cameras here, okay? I love you, princess. I don't want anybody in or out of this house until I get back. All right? Who's ready for some chocolate? Chocolate? Oh my gosh, can I have like, lots of marshmallows? Sugar, and then more sugar. Chocolate. Ooh, shit. Mom? Ooh, shit girl. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm sorry. Today's activities got me a little wired up. Okay. Mmm, so, I guess my plans for the night are canceled? Oh, I'm sorry baby. You heard your father. Yeah. Ooh, let's go see something about this hot chocolate, okay? Okay. What would you like to play? I would like to play rock paper scissors. Rock paper scissors. Okay, but you've got to count to 10. Okay, three, two, one. Rock paper scissors, rock paper scissors, rock paper scissors, rock paper scissors. Wait, wait, wait, we've got to start over. No, that wasn't the scissor, that was a point. Can I talk to you about something? What? It's about Myra. What is it? You've caught her talkin' to herself before, right? So? What's wrong with that? She's been mumbling to herself since she was a toddler. This is how you look, ah. I understand she always wanted a little brother, but earlier today, in her room, she was... What? There's nothin' strange about that. She just got a little creative mind, that's all. No, but it seemed like she was talkin' to someone or with someone. Oh, Lisa. Lisa. Can you just go get me some cups? That's not right. Can you just get the mugs out the cabinet? Please. She was talking with someone. Thank you. I just, Esther, I just don't think it's right. I think you should talk to her. Talk to her about what? I don't know. It wasn't right. She was talkin' to someone in that room. Let's talk about how you talk to yourself. Girl. When you in the shower... I'm just playin'. You know I'm silly. Yeah, I don't know about that. Girl, come on. That's different, and I'm grown. I'm just playin'. You know I act a fool when I'm gettin' ready. Why is that different? 'Cause I'm just doin' my hair. You know I act crazy when I'm doin' my hair. Yeah, okay. I don't see that as a difference. How is that now? She was talking with someone, or to someone. I don't, I think we should get her some help. Get out my way. Yeah. Myra, get off me. Who's ready for some hot chocolate? You, me! Creative, hmm. - Hot chocolate. - Thank you so much. Thank you, Mom. You're welcome. Hot y'all, now listen, be careful, 'cause it's hot, all right? What's up, bro, you ready to do this? Man, those cameras you installed for me. What about 'em? I mess somethin' up? I noticed something real weird last night when I looked at 'em. I saw Bear Bear... and the screen just became distorted, for like, a quick second. Sometimes they can pick up electrical interferences, man. Pretty sure I installed 'em pretty clean, - so I wouldn't worry about it. - I'm sure you did, too. When the screen came back to normal, it was gone. Come on man, dogs be erratic, puppies be everywhere. Don't worry, I wouldn't trip out that. Darren. Puppies don't move that damn fast, man. Naw man, we talking about distortion for like a fraction of a second. Man. Sounds creepy. Yeah, I hear ya. Hey man, get this job done so we can get you home. Yeah, come on. Hey, Steven. Hey man, hey man, tow truck's gonna be here a lot later than we thought. Be here for a while. Shit. All right man, let me call the wife. All right, man. - Let it snow... - Motel... I love... Christmas. No. Motown Christmas, yeah, Motown Christmas. Tryin' to take over. Listen to your mama, here. Don't play hers. Wait. Tiana, turn that down, baby. It's your father. Hello? Hey baby. It's gonna be a little bit longer than I thought. How's everybody doin'? Yeah, we're good. Okay. Tell the girls for me. Will do. All right, baby, I love you. Love you, too. Daddy okay? Oh yeah, baby. He's just gonna be a little while longer, that's all. That's good. Glad he didn't fry himself. Auntie, you ride Daddy. You so rude, don't be talkin' about Daddy like that. All right, Darren, let's mess somethin' up. I hope you ready for tonight. off that high community drip, right? All right, man look, when the tow truck comes, make sure you clear those cars off the corner first. Until then, we gonna clean this up. Oh, thank you. What happened out there? New guy on the scene dropped the cable latch. Luckily it was only a few feet above me, or this coulda been a lot worse. Oh boy. Look like you got a big lump comin' in on your head, too. Right, and one helluva headache. Mmm. Hey baby. - Mmm hmm. - Wanna do me a favor? Go over there, tell the girls to keep it down a little bit. I'ma be out cold in a minute, anyway. Hmm, I know you will with your little low tolerance for medication. Forewarning, though. Those pills I gave you, those from your old back surgery. Yeah, I remember that. Just two of those took me out. Right, so it won't be long. All right, baby. Esther. Hmm? You all right? Yeah, of course. That comment you made earlier, about my gun? Can you finish it for me? Don't worry about that, baby. It's okay. Don't you think it's kinda strange? Myra's puppy's in the back yard and on the camera it just disappeared that quick, and then you saw, in the garbage can bloodied and gutted. Steven, it's been a long day, okay? You should try and get some rest, okay? I'm gonna go out here and kick it with the kids for a little while and then I'll come back, all right? Okay, I'll take that. Y'all keep it down though, okay? Will do. I love you, baby. Love you, too. So, what gift did y'all open? Girl, I told them they could open up one gift and they picked the one Carl sent us. Yeah, Ma, it's a ghost. Tiana, hand me that pillow. I don't even believe in this mess. Yes, you do Tiana. Remember when we were at Uncle Carl's house and we played Light As A Feather, Stiff As A Board? What kinda game is that? Girl, no. I didn't play. Yes, you did. Esther. Girl, look. That's why I don't like goin' to Carl's house. Go send these girls a game like that. Lisa, what are you afraid of? Now, everybody put your fingertips on this triangle thing. Wait, aren't there any rules? Oh, yeah, yeah. Rule number one. Never use the Ouija Board if you think it's just a game. Mmm. Rule number two. Never use the Ouija Board alone. Rule number three. Never use the Ouija Board in a cemetery. Never leave the planchette on the Ouija Board when you aren't using it. Well, the hell with rule number four. Ooh, Lisa. Rule number five. Never forget to say goodbye to the Ouija spirits. Now, everybody put your fingertips on the planchette. Now what? For each person, we circle around one time. One. Two. Three. Four. That's it? Ask it a question. Don't tell me this thing goin' talk? Girl, this thing ain't nothin' but a piece of cardboard and plastic. I'm not asking anything. I'll ask. Is there a ghost in this house? Who's doin' that? Really? Myra, stop playin'. - It's not me. - It's not me, either. This is so cool. Oh, hell no. What? Auntie, you threw the game away. Myra, that ain't no damn game. Lisa. We asked that thing if there's a ghost in this house and that thing said yes. Now, Lisa, you are overreacting just a little bit. That is just a game. Girl, I'm about two seconds from goin' to a hotel tonight. Oh, girl. Mmm, mmm, mmm. Ma, can I... can we just get some more hot chocolate? Yeah, hold on, baby. Hello? Hey Lester. Nothin', what are you doin'? Lisa, go mess up her night. Girl, her night's already messed up. Let's get you some more hot chocolate. My bones. Auntie, I'm on the phone. Ma! I'm on the phone. Mama! Unh unnh. What in the world you callin' her for? You just focus on Lester. Mom, what happened to Bear Bear? Hmm. Well, baby, I don't think you're old enough to handle that right now. Well, I know a car didn't kill Bear Bear. I know. Yeah, it gets on my nerves. Tryin' to have some alone time to talk to you on the phone, but, you know how my family is, so... Ooh, Myra, honey go get your mama a pillow. What? - Ma. - What? Why y'all gangin' up in my room? Shut up, stupidhead. Ooh. Ha ha, you missed. You got slapped. Mama, I swear. Y'all got about 15 more minutes of my time and I'm goin' to bed, I promise you. Get off the phone. Always talkin' to Lester. Ooh, hi Lester, I love you Lester, ooh. Lester, Tiana got to go. We about to spend some family time. Auntie. Bye, Lester. Mommy. Did you just hang up on my boyfriend? Yes. There you go. Oh, thank you, sweetie. Ooh, Myra sweetie, go get the cover off your mama's chair in the office. Okay, my goodness. Ooh, girl. Stop runnin' in this house. My bed in my room, but... What are you doin'? Esther, you have the most energetic children, I swear. Auntie? Are we gonna be okay? Why'd you ask me that, honey? Well all right, I'm tired, hell. I got a injured husband down the hall and you know men are babies, 'specially when they sick. Girl, I know that's right. Mmm hmm. Bye. 'Night. Myra, you okay honey? Auntie. Can I sleep with you tonight? Yeah, honey, come here. You dang. You can sleep with us. Y'all always wanna be in my bed. We can have a slumber party. Slumber party. Yes. It's okay. Y'all get on my nerves. Get out of my room, geez. Got your own room. Who are you? What do you want with me? No! No! No! I, I can't. Tiana. Tiana. Tiana! Tiana! Tiana! Tiana! Kill them all. Kill them all. Kill them. Kill them all. Tiana. Kill them all. Tiana! Kill them all. Kill them all. Tiana, baby what's wrong? Ooh, oh God baby, come here. I'm so sorry, Mommy, I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. Something just woke me up and told me to kill everybody. I don't know, Mommy. I'm sorry, I'm so sorry, please help me. Please help me. I don't know what I'm doing, please. Mommy, please help me. It's okay, it's okay. Come on, it's okay. Let's go inside. Get in the bed. What's goin' on? Lisa, nothin'. I'll be right back. What's, Tiana. Lisa, just give her a minute. What's wrong? Tiana baby, Tiana. Hello? Hello? Oh my God. Myra. Come here, princess. Mama? Steven? Esther, don't move. Daddy. Esther. Don't move. Myra, baby come here, okay? Come here, princess. Esther! I said don't move! Daddy, wait! Hold on, we don't even know what happened. Esther, please! Stop. Baby, please don't make me shoot you. Honey, I will. I swear to God I will. Esther, look at me. Look at me! Steven. Why are you pointing your gun at me? Why? Really, you're gonna ask me why? Look at you. Our daughter's terrified of you! You standing here like a monster. You expect me not to protect my child? Daddy, wait, wait. Something did happen, but, I don't know what happened. What, Lisa, if you don't know, then somebody better damn well start explaining. Steven, all I can remember is we played that damn Ouija Board game and I was thrown from the damn couch. Myra, baby come here. Please, come here. Daddy, wait. No, no Steven, don't. Esther. Don't make me kill you. Esther? No! Esther, we have to talk about what happened last night. Steven. I truly don't know what you wanna hear. What I would like to hear is why the hell you were about to attack our daughter. I wasn't about to attack anyone. Then whatever the hell spoke out of you was. And if Myra didn't scream, I don't know what the hell you would have did to my family! Steven, I really don't know what happened! Then there's something seriously wrong with you! Stop it! Look at what you're doing. Myra, you all right? Yes, but, is there something wrong with Mommy? No, baby. Then what was after me? Myra, come here princess. Hey I think I'ma take the girls ice skatin'. You don't have to go if you don't want to, baby. Tiana, you rolling? No, Lester said he wants to hang out for a little while, so. Y'all goin' be home in time for dinner? Yeah. So, Steven, you leavin'? Just for a few hours. I won't be long. You scared me, Mom. Oh baby, I'm so sorry. So, I'll see you guys in a little bit? Yeah. All right. Bye. Be good. I love you. Hey, what do you wanna do? Can we play outside? Okay, yeah, let's go. Myra! Myra! Myra! Esther, I'm tryin' to be as calm as I possibly can. Where the hell's my daughter? Does this have somethin' to do with last night? Oh, so now you can't talk? Yes. Thought you said you didn't remember anything. Steven, I don't remember, but I think I know why it happened. If you think you know, then the police should be here right now. Steven, the police can't... What? The police cannot help us. Why? Hmm? Steven, please. It's the Tall Man. The Tall Man? What Tall Man? The Tall Man is real. Real? Real what? You're not makin' any sense! What are you talkin' about? Steven please. Come sit with me. Sit for what? Our daughter is missing! And you're ranting about some Goddamn tall man. Steve, please! What are you talkin' about? It was a while ago, and I was at my parents' house on 65th. And I remember I was on the phone with Lisa and I was tellin' her, you know, about my dreams, about my wants and what I wanted. It wasn't that too much. And I said, you know, a house, the kids, the nice job, two incomes. It's hard to come by exactly what you want outta life. You know, and I wouldn't actually sell my soul done git it, though. So, one day I was heading out to the store and somebody just bumped into me, and I remember I felt this sharp pain in the middle of my hand and I looked down and it was, it was blood coming all the way down my arm and I, and I started to black out. I hit the ground and next thing I know, I looked up. This, this tall figure was walking away from me. It was real. It was real. Come on. Blood on your hand? Tall figures, ghosts? You make some kinda deal with Myra? No, Steven. That's the thing. I didn't make any deal. I didn't agree with anything. I was, it was almost like I was tricked somehow. Tricked? Baby, what are you talking about? What, are you trying to say your family, us, me, we're all the devil's work? Steven, no. We invited it into this house, y'all. How, Lisa? With that damn Ouija Board game. Oh, Lisa. This is way deeper than that. Oh my God. Esther, if you think it's deeper than some damn board game, then you're crazy and there's something seriously wrong with you. Steven, nothing is wrong with me. The hell it ain't! What? Esther, I love you, but after playin' that game, somethin' came outta that room, took over you and came after us. What are you talkin' about, Lisa? That game has nothin' to do with this. It does. Myra asked if there was a ghost in the house. The triangle thing moved over to the yes and then all of this happened. So, what do you wanna do then, Lisa, huh? Since you seem to have all the Goddamn answers. Whoa, look here sister. Don't go takin' your spiritual frustrations out on me. Okay, all right. Stop it, stop it, that's enough! Steven, believe me, I'm against playin' it again, too, but I think we have to. Hey! Myra is missing! And I don't think it's time to play any more Goddamn games! We have to play. Tiana, I said no more games. But Daddy, listen. I said no. Daddy, listen to me. When Myra was reading the rules, she said if you thought it was just a game, don't play, and we treated it like it was just a game. Hey, I get it. But I am telling you to listen to me. I am your father. This is not real. This game, this dark figure shit, that's not real! Daddy, yes it is real. Why do you keep tellin' me this? Because. Something happened to me last night. Oh my God. Steven. There's more... Mama, please no. I know, baby. What the hell you guys talkin' about? Steven. Something came from playin' this game, and whatever it was, it came out and it possessed Tiana and it told her to kill us! No, no, no, no! No more games! No. But, Daddy, the... I said no! Steven, I think they right. I think we have to play this game again. Go check the cameras. Check the cameras, Steve. You've gotta put your fingertips on it, Daddy. Okay, then what? Well, according to Myra, we've gotta move this piece around once for each person that's playing. Okay. One. Two. Three. Four. Dad, wait. For what? Look, this is nonsense. I keep telling you guys, this is a waste of time. Tiana, just ask this thing to leave. Steven. Steven, Steven! Steven! Steven! Steven! Hey baby, good mornin'. Hey princess. Hey. Ah, I know you're excited. Yeah, Mama, we're gonna go ice skating. Come on, Esther, you ain't going? Yeah, get ready, Ma. You know we all wanna see you fall on your butt. You know she is. Mmm hmm. Ha ha ha, yeah Mom. Come on, let's go. Oh yeah, Mama. Let's get up outta here. I am ready. No, let's go skatin'. Girl, you got so much drama. I was supposed to ask him. I know, I know. Girl, me too. We gonna have so much fun. Roll it up, roll it up, come on, girl. Yeah, you right, let's go. I know, I know. You ready to go ice skatin'? Steven, hey man, I'm not trying to scare you, but, I checked your cameras for you and I found that the recorded audio was on a separate track, man. Steven, man, I heard something when goin' over the footage. Man, I'm just gonna text you the audio. You gotta hear this. Just listen to this, all right, man? You gotta check it out. Just listen to it, okay? I'm sending it to you right now. Just listen to the audio, I gotta go. Something came from playin' this game, and whatever it was, it came out and it possessed Tiana and it told her to kill us!
