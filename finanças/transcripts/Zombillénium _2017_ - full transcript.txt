Blue for you... Daddy, are monsters real? Well, if they are, I certainly hope they pay their taxes like the rest of us. Dad, can you take me to Zombillenium? - So, how's it going? - Bad. They blocked the access. - What do they want? - Maybe keep their jobs? I checked it over. That factory's noncompliant. So, business as usual. Promise them a bonus. Make something up. But by tomorrow, it has to be razed. What were you asking me, hon? Uh, I'd like to go to Zombillenium. - Sure. I'll take you. - Swear? Cross my heart and hope to die. - Come on. Work hard. - I'm doing my best. Not you, stupid. Off you go. - See you Friday, sweetie. - See you, Daddy. - For Friday, or for tomorrow? - Tomorrow, I said! - Good-bye, honey. - Bye, Mommy. Bye. - But how do I clear them off? - Just work it out. Call the cops, or even the army, if necessary. But hey, at the break of day, I want to hear the sweet sound of the tractors, breathe in the smell of rubble, personally witness the triumph of civilization. - Save our jobs! - That's beautiful, boss. Uh... What was that? Hey, here comes Mr. Quality Control. - Coffee as usual? - No, something stronger to calm my nerves. Okay. What's going on? Just now, there, at the crossroads, I just dropped my daughter off at school, and this... this... this flying chick pops up in front of me! I crashed into the traffic light to avoid her. A flying chick? You clearly ran into the Zombillenium witch. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Another one of their publicity stunts. Publicity schmublicity! Halloween. Pumpkins. I can deal with that. But their damn lousy corpses park? Over my dead body! Hey, Sylvain, keep it down. Is your hunting permit up-to-date? Where that park is, there used to be the mine. And one day... boom! Mine shaft explosion. Dozens of my workmates dead. Rumor has it that they're the ones who are now working in the park. Yes, sir, the devil took their souls! And they only hire foreigners. My daughter wants to go there. Huh! I'd shut down that dreadful park. Well, isn't that precisely your job? Yeah, it is! I'll pay them a surprise visit this morning. I'll control every detail. Safety blueprints, management. Ha! That'll teach 'em. The last time some overconfident rookie tried to rub their nose in it, he was never seen again! Ha-ha! Here I come, you phony monsters! May I help... Francis Von Bloodt, manager. You... You scared me. That's my job. Do you have an appointment? Hector Saxe. I control standards and always come unannounced. That's my job. And finally, our ghost train. Safety and sustainable development are the guiding principles of our park. Here are all the certificates of compliance in order, Mr. Sack. Saxe. We have spared no expense regarding new standards of compli... Hmm. Mm-hmm. These harnesses don't comply with the B-75 circular on amusement park safety. But, Mr. Saxe. Why don't you bring your children to our park instead of controlling it. Hmm. Attempted bribery. Well done. How did you know I had a daughter? - Francis. - Aton, this is really not a good time. - But, Francis, the cotton candy stall has... - Excuse me. This will just take a minute. Aton, this guy is a human and a control inspector. Now, scram! Who cares if he's an inspector or whatever? I have a problem. Hmm. Oh? I have way more important things to do! I told you I don't care. I need your help. Oh. A sweatshop. And it's not on the blueprints. It looks like the Zombillenium has come to... Oh! Tsk, tsk, tsk, Mr. Saxe. You shouldn't have gone through that door. - You've seen too much. - Are you trying to intimidate me? Your park is obsolete! The harnesses, the roller coaster structure, not to mention employment of illegal workers. My report will be... Oh! ...a killer. What are we going to do with you? Drip... drop... goes... the... rain... on... the... heap. On the heap, not the hip. Again. On the heap. Period. I... slide... Penelope! I want to see your nose on your paper. Uh, miss, why is Lucie in the graveyard? Hmm? Oh, yes. Well, it's... It's a terrible tragedy. Lucie lost her daddy yesterday morning. - Oh, no! - Well, he had it coming. They say he used to put people out of work. You can't say that! It's not nice! - It's no fun to lose your dad. - That's what my dad said. Quiet! Hush. And since Lucie already lost her mom, she's going to stay at the boarding school until the end of the term. You'll have to help her through this hardship. Be kind to her, et cetera. Well, let's get back to it. Blaise, is our controller awake? But... Did you bite him too? To turn him into a werewolf. - We have enough vampires. - But, Blaise! - So, he's a what? - We'll find out in a second. Hello, Mr. Saxe. You're dead. Congratulations. You've been hired at Zombillenium. Ah! Mr. Manager, what I found in the basement was not pretty. Also, I was mugged! I warn you, I'm going to send a report to general inspection... Ten bucks he lands on his feet, and he's a werewolf. Ten bucks he turns into a bat, and he's a vampire. A zombie? What the... Aaah! Aaah! The park opens its gates at 9:00. Staff must be present from 8:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. Except for night events that last all night. Ah, Mr. Von Bloodt. Here you are. Hello, Miranda. Oh, you have new glasses. Very nice. Oh! Thanks for noticing. - Hey, Freddy. - Hello, boss. I have quotes for the maintenance of the roller coasters. - Go with the cheapest. - Okay, I've had it. I want out. Forget all attempts to escape, Mr. Saxe. It's absolutely forbidden to leave the park. - What about my daughter? - You should have thought about her before. So, did you fix that casket, guys? As good as new, boss. Uh-oh! The toy manufacturers are asking for a go-ahead on the zombie figurines. - Granted. Hello, Arthus. - Hello, boss. - The golems are asking to be off on Saturdays. - Nope. No way. We keep getting these letters from teenagers who want to become vampires. Good morning, Mr. Von Bloodt. Good morning, kids. That stupid vampire trend. I hate it. Give them the usual reply, Miranda. Tell them to forget cheesy novels and chastity. They should just have fun and study. Some are threatening to kill themselves. Well, if they do, we'll get in touch with them. Hey! You're new. Unionized? Oh! Well, certainly not. That's the last thing... Sirius Jefferson, staff representative. Hector Saxe, control inspec... What's going on? This is Hector, a newcomer who'll soon be joining our union. Isn't that right? You know being dead doesn't necessarily mean being exploited. I, for one, was an activist for equal rights for colored people in the '60s in Texas. I died on the electric chair for defending our civil rights. Dude! It's no joke, okay? Shut your mouth. We've heard enough. Mm-hmm. So today it's Texas? Yesterday it was Mississippi. Yeah, yeah, go ahead. Laugh your guts out. Thanks to you, the employers feel really threatened. By the way, you're a zombie, right? Not a snooty vampire or a werewolf bully. - How did you die anyway? - I'm not dead! - All right, sure. - Aaah! Ah! - Let me out of here! - Hey. My coffee. Could you get around to this... Aaah! Help me! Help! Please! I need your help, please. Call the police. Look at him. Welcome to hell. Come on. Follow me. - Yeah! Hey! - Hey, come back. Stop running! Kid. Boo! How are you kids doing? I've got some treats for you. Yeah! Whoa! Stop it! - I want candied apple! - Got it! Here's your station. That's for you, maestro. Power's here. You pour the sugar in here. You grab a stick and spin it like this, and voilà! You don't need a master's degree to use this machine. So long, buddy. To think I used to be a pharaoh. Mary received 12 oranges for her birthday. Mary's poor. She gave four to Jeremy and lost three on the road because of a hole in her plastic bag. Miss? Do living dead people exist for real? Of course not. What an idea! - Why do you ask? - So, Santa isn't real either? Ah, he is. He's very real. But then how come flying reindeer exist and zombies don't? Lucie! Why are you being so impudent, hmm? Oh! This, this, and this! Aaah! Ooh! Quiet! If I hear one single one of you mentioning that... that... that lair, that park for the depraved, be prepared to spend the entire night in the cupboard! Oh, my God. No way. He really said that? Wait. Let's take a selfie. Totally. - You're, like, so hot. - Let's send that to Nick. So, you're selling balloons? No, I'm walking them. Say, all of this, it's fake, right? I mean, I'm not really a vampire or a werewolf. The fall from the tower was a setup, wasn't it? Nope. You're the devil's property, and you're an evil creature. But we don't know precisely what kind. Based on the smell of your breath, I'd say you're a zombie. Yeah, right. What are you, a witch? I'm dressed like a witch so people can't figure out that's what I am. I'm doing an internship to discover the corporate world. My task for today is to keep an eye on you, but believe me, I'm not really thrilled. Steven. What would we do without him? Learn a lesson, zombie. Look at that vampire. He keeps the park rolling just with his attraction. The same can't be said of those zombies over there. Honestly, who'd want to see that hogwash? Uh-huh. Mmm. If it were up to me, we'd only have vampires here. Sneaky little rascal. They're all crazy. I'll warn the cops. Doctors, priests, the press. I know people. I'll spread the word. I have connections. I'll show them. Lucie. I didn't call her yesterday. She must be worried sick. Oh! Huh? - A monster! Aaah! - Huh? You're gonna end up as a trophy! Hey. Are you crazy? Come on. Show yourself. I... Huh? Phew. Again, these horrors! It's for my dad. Do you see this, Lucie? This is a skeleton! So, yes, your father is a skeleton, but a skeleton that's buried six feel under, a skeleton that doesn't move, doesn't have muscles. No more lungs, no more eyes, no more heart! When will you finally get over it, Lucie? Do you want me to send you to a specialized school? Is that what you want? What? Oh! No! Uh... Oh! There you are. Hmm? - Come on. Hop in. - Get out of my way! - I'm gonna shoot ya! - Shoot me with a leek? Huh? Daddy? Weren't you told that you're not allowed to leave the park? But look at me. What's happening to me? Look at these horns, these ears, these teeth, these hands, these fingers, this-this... Okay. Are you planning a complete inventory? But I-I-I'm horrible. Which means, you can't leave the park. Oh. You'll get used to it. Huh? Oh! As stupid as a suitcase without a handle. Come on. Get in the car. Okay, you're in shock, but you need to get over it. What the hell! Huh. What? You're damn monsters! - Stop! - I'm coming. I'm coming. I don't get it. I have coffee with him every week. - What's his problem? - The problem is you're dead. You have no business with the living. That's why he wants to kill you. It's obvious. That doesn't make sense. Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Ah! Oh! Oh! Whoa! Aaah! Aaah! Now I got ya. Whoa! Aaah! I'm gonna die! I told you, you're already dead. Huh? Huh? It's the last time I fetch a runaway monster. I'm not a freak pound. And my car must be going up in flames by now. Oh. Why don't you ask Daddy to get you a new one? Sirius, this is not the time. - I'm done with this guy. - You're an intern. You do as you're told, okay? - That's not a job for me. - Do you prefer to sell balloons? Zombies and other Z-movie monsters don't belong in this park! You know where they should be? Down below in hell! Z-movie monsters? Come on. I'm getting tired of this daddy's little girl. Sirius, just take him to his cell. Okay, boss. Hey, what's with your mail order Hellboy look? Come on, dude. Let's split. ♪ Yeah, Mr. Modo ♪ ♪ Ugly Mac Beer ♪ ♪ Still digging in the crates ♪ ♪ And Mrs. Modo there too ♪ ♪ Yeah, exactly ♪ ♪ There's no more Digging in crates ♪ ♪ Checked by J Dilla ♪ So you see, the vampires call our floor the ghetto. Don't know if you've noticed, but the different groups of monsters don't exactly get along. - Yo, Mikey. - Hey, Sirius. - Are all monsters under house arrest? - Yep. All of us. Some vampires have demanded the right to go outside since they look quite human. But Francis said, "No way." He insists it should be the same for all monsters. Here you are. Your new home, sweet home. Hey, what's with the ridiculous horns? Well, for a guy who tried to shut down our park, I think it's appropriate. Yeah. I guess I was doing the dirty work. Hey! The horn man can play the blues. Yeah, I was in a band once. Before my wife died. After that, I had to get a real job to look after my little girl. So I worked. I worked. I had no time left to care for Lucie. I sent her to boarding school. I didn't see much of her. And now I'll never see her again. Hey, it's hard at first. We all know. But you'll get used to it. We've all left people we love behind. I haven't. They were all my slaves. They poisoned me. Anyway, I'm off. If you need to talk, we're not far. Now, get some rest, Hector Saxe. Hey! Cut it out with the lullaby! Some people are trying to sleep! Mmm. Hello, Francis. Hello, Mr. President. I received the recent park attendance levels. We're still in the red. It's true, we had a slight drop this semester again, but... Zombillenium is plummeting! I gave you plenty of time to straighten this out. The park visitor curve has been consistently dropping. This time we have to shut down. But you know what that means, to lay off all our staff. Francis, when you came to me 20 years ago with your project to reintegrate all the monsters still haunting modern society, I thought it was brilliant. An amusement park as a business adventure. Fantastic! But what did you promise me in exchange for all your zombies' souls? Big profits. - And is Zombillenium making money? - No, sir. It's over, Francis. Zombillenium has to shut down! You can't do that to us. Give me just one month to show you that we can be terrifying, - that Zombillenium... - Two weeks! You have two weeks to straighten things out. If not, I will reclaim what is mine. For your lot, this means a one-way ticket to hell! Have I made myself clear? Crystal clear, sir. So, jack-in-the-box, sleep well? Good morning, everyone. I have two announcements to make. And I need all of your attention, please. First, Steven continues to be our employee of the month for the 78th consecutive time. Thanks for the good work. Hey, don't mention it, boss. After all, I'm only attracting 99 percent of visitors. Ah, Steven, you're so strong, you're so hot. Bite me, bite me, bite me, please! The second announcement is about our cherished park, which, as you know, is experiencing some financial hardship. I have therefore made a decision to secure the future for all of us. I'm planning to find some investors among humans. You have 15 days to make this park the scariest thing ever. So, now be scary, or else. You all know what to expect. Um, what are we to expect? - We're all going to hell. - Aren't we there already? I think this is the perfect opportunity to present to these investors my ideas for the park. My friends, listen to me. I have a dream! A dream for an ideal park built on class, on excellence. Vampirama! A park totally rid of all these ugly freaks. What's in it for us, huh? We're just gonna give you manicures? Uh, who? You? You go down, spin the wheel in hell. Steven, we've been through all this. I created this park for all monsters... vampires, werewolves, cyclops, ghosts, and, uh... ...them too, yes. - And especially for zombies. - Oh! But zombies are has-beens. No one's into zombies anymore. The trend has changed. Seriously, do you think people come here to be scared? The future of monsters is romanticism. Sensuality. Passion. Mystery. And certainly not so-called fear induced by rotting corpses. Anyway, no one here is scary anymore. Yes! I am! My name is Hector Saxe, and yesterday, I scared the hell out of my own kid! Wow. And he did that all by himself. Let's give him a big hand. I was an awful dad, but I promised to take my daughter to this park, so believe me, I'll do everything I can to keep it in business. You can bring on those investors, Mr. Von Bloodt. And trust me, I'll give them a scare they'll never forget! So be it. Try to make the ghost train a little spookier, Mr. Saxe. You'll get to check whether it conforms to standards. And now, everybody, get to work! What do you think? Isn't that awesome? So cool. - It's lame. - Lame? Oh, seriously, it's lousy. Thriller's old. You need a new groove. And it's not even Thriller. Yeah, well, we couldn't afford the rights. I can see why vampires are so trendy. So what does His Majesty, fear expert, suggest? Listen, I know fear. I gave the willies to all the big companies around. My weapon? The surprise effect. You're too predictable, guys. Rule number one: Find your look. ♪ Let's keep it simple And it seems like They're really complicated ♪ ♪ In love is what I find And that's what I'll be ♪ Rule number two: Appear where and when the victim least expects it. ♪ We're patient and we're kind And we'll be free ♪ Rule number three: Find the right prop. ♪ So all righty now ♪ Yeah!

I was, like, so scared! Totally. Let's go again. Oh, yeah! Amazing. You're the man. You're so cool! Thank you, guys. So, can somebody here tell me what happened? It was Steven. He tried to sabotage our show. That's true. But they kept bursting in on my Ferris wheel. We were about to explain when Gretchen came and stood between us with her spell. Yeah, except that I was at the cotton candy stall when suddenly... Stop laughing. - Hmm. - Oh, you need to get rid of them! They're dragging the park down! They're much more popular than you now. Yeah? If I could use my powers, I'd be more popular. No, Gretchen. You're an intern. You're here to learn. Oh. Um, while you're all here, what do you think of the new poster? Hmm. Zombies on a billboard? Why not advertise our trash cans while you're at it? - Yes! - Someday we'll clean up things around here. And we'll sort the rubbish. That's for sure. Humph! Kids, tonight is the monthly staff party. Relax. Just have fun. Enjoy the park. Tomorrow I want you to be in shape to give the creeps to all those stupid tourists in shorts. What are we celebrating? It's our little tradition. Every full moon, the park is ours. We can chill and forget about our work a little. And guess who obtained all this for us? You're looking right at him. Congratulations, Mr. Union Rep. Why don't you get us some holidays instead? Fixed-term contracts. Extra month's pay. Uh, yeah, right. Negotiations are under way. Yoo-hoo! Hey, boys! How you doin'? Come on, guys. Come join us! Come on. Let's climb on board! Here's to death and the surprises it has in store for us. Whoo-hoo! Gulp! Gulp! Gulp! Gulp! Gulp! Gulp! Gulp! Gulp! Gulp! Gulp! Gulp! Gulp! Yeah! Congrats. Now you're one of us. Oh, I think we beat our new record today. Right, Dolores? How many? 5,000 visitors. Yes! That's almost the number of visitors for the entire park! Which means that we zombies are totally hot again! - Whoo-hoo! - Thanks to our new friend. Hmm. Tomorrow the investors will see who's got the biggest waiting line. Do you have an invitation? Well, I'm okay. I'll be damned. They've made their own VIP area. Whatever. Bats will be bats. When I see that, all I want to do is... crash their party! Good evening, vampires! We got a new guy in town, and we thought it'd be nice to introduce him. Ladies and gentlemen, Hector Saxe! - Get out of here. - Get lost, carrion! - Get off the stage! - Hey, get off! Get out of here! You think this is a firefighters' ball?

Let's show our guts. Let's sleep in our pus. Steven? Stop it. Oh, yes. For sure he attracts visitors with his little ride, but let's be serious. As long as he's hanging around, - attendance will never exceed 5,000 people! - Hey! I never asked to be here. Go get lost! Easy does it, kids. The investors are coming tomorrow. If you keep up the good work like you have so far, the park is saved. I'm counting on you. Ha-ha-ha! Hello, my fellow corpses! Hey, check out what I stole from the vampire crypt! A hundred percent pure blood. Here, have a sip, Luther King. It'll make you feel free. Oop. All right, all right. I confess. I never defended civil rights. I used to sing in dive bars, and I sold my soul to the devil in exchange for fame. There! I was driving to my first gig. My opening night, my car crashed into a truck, and here I am. Wait! Whoa. Wait. You guys, please keep this to yourselves, okay? I mean, I would totally lose credibility as a union leader. Well, given your success, it wouldn't make that much difference. Yeah, really. It's not you've been able to organize a strike. What? What about the 65-hour work week? Huh? You want grateful zombies. - What's the use of a union if you don't go on strike ever? - What? Are you crazy? That'd be a one-way ticket to hell. Sure. Hey, zombie guys. Can I join the conversation? Huh! Look at the intern. Is your mascara workshop over with your vampire friends? Oh, them. They're, uh... Forget it. Hey, you're pretty good with a guitar. You're not too bad yourself. Shame you're into Muzak. Hey, are you really the devil's daughter? What? No! Where does that piece of gossip come from? That's what everybody says. And who's "everybody"? Well, maybe the same one who claims certain union leaders died on the electric chair. Oh, shut up. I'm so sick of your sarcasm. The investors will be here tomorrow. I'm gonna go and get some shut-eye. He's got a point. I must go. Same here. And no naughty business, kids. Your daughter lives in that village, doesn't she? What's her name? Lucie. I've been a rotten dad. Boy, I deserve these horns. Now my daughter's in the hands of a crazy teacher. She needs me, and I'm only realizing it now? Uh... Okay, charming company. Do you still wanna try to see her? I'm not monitoring you anymore, you know? Yeah, but I don't want to scare her. - What are you staring at? - What? - Y-Y-Your tattoo. - The griffin? It means I've reached the first level of the witch hierarchy. - Then come the basilisk, the harpy, and the dragon. - Ah. How do you reach the next level? With an internship? By making light prevail over the darkness. Uh... I know. Doesn't make sense to me either. You're... You're pretty cool, actually. I mean, despite the fact that you're always in a bad mood. I mean, not that it bothers me, right? I... Then again, you're an intern, so it makes sense if you have to do the dirty... Well, I'm not saying you do the dirty work. I mean, you-you... Do you wanna sit for a minute? No? You... Go to bed, Hector Saxe. ♪ Na na na na Na na na ♪ ♪ Na na na na Na na na ♪ ♪ Na na na na ♪ You like him, don't you? Steven, for crying out loud! These are the women's lockers! You still have a lot to learn about vampires. Garlic? That's rubbish we made up a long time ago to let humans think they could beat us. So, does he get to you with his tiny horns? Why? Are you jealous? Yes, I am. There. I've said it. Happy? I ruined your concert because it made me mad to see the two of you so close. All I do is ruin everything! Like with us two. I've been a pathetic, self-centered... Pervert, upstart, manipulator? A moron obsessed by his own image in the eyes of his fans. But when I saw you onstage with your guitar, what you shared with the audience, wow! You managed to bring together the vampires and the zombies! You're the future of the park! Oh, it was just a short jam session. It was more than that! You can be a huge success! If you perform in front of the investors, the park is saved! Yeah, but Francis will never let me. Make your choice. Remain in the darkness, or finally triumph in the light. As you can see right here... Yah! Huh? Uh! Oh! Oh! No! Aaah! Aaah! Here we are on Main Street, the main boulevard of the park. And from here you can see the Ferris wheel. Quite a successful attraction, I must admit. And we also have some actors. - Look, look, look at those three. - Whoa! Whoa! Aren't they terribly colorful? Quite funny, aren't they? Well, now let's go to the main attraction, the famous ghost train! Uh... Huh? Steven! Wait till Francis hears about this, buddy! The old man? He's showing off with the new bosses. I'm just cleaning up the park for him. Nothing personal, really. But you must admit, you're a blight in the picture. Oh! We need to adjust to the market demands. Zombies, they're has-beens. Whoo! Hoo-hoo! Yeah! Ooh! Hey! Nah. Uh... Ehh... Uh! Mmm. Hector? Hmm? Well, madam, gentlemen, how would you like to invest in fear? Your show is terribly outdated. And also quite stressful. Do you realize there are children in this park? Personally, I imagined an innovative concept with more glamorous characters. Away with these horrible zombies. But zombies are the theme of the park. They're the reason people come here, or it wouldn't be called "Zombillenium." That's not the point. I've read all the market research. They show consumer morale is at its lowest, and people would rather take their minds off their problems during their free time. Who wants to see monsters on the weekend when you already have to cope with your boss all week? Look, I've been managing this park for over 15 years, - so I won't be intimidated by your cheap market... - Francis, calm down. Such a funny guy. Gentlemen, madam, I'm sure you have some fabulous ideas and suggestions. What you need is, how can I put it, a fear that's not scary. That's it! A fear that makes you smile! A romantic fear. With beautiful monsters, like that charming young man over there on the wheel. There's your concept. Ugly monsters are out. And you'll need cats as well. People love... Miranda, I have an emergency. Please take care of my guests. Of course, Mr. Francis. Don't worry, Miranda. I'll look after the guests. Gretchen, what on earth? This is not good timing! Gretchen, this is no time to draw attention! I'm in a meeting. Uh... - But we're never allowed to do anything in this park. - I've had it! I'm going to have a little conversation with your father! "Nyah-nya-nya-nya-nya-nah-nah. Your father." I'm sorry. I hope I didn't take too long. Oh, wow! That's fantastic! You've decided to invest in Zombillenium! That's something you won't regret, my friends. You'll see, we... Change of management? - You understand? - Huh? Huh? Oh, yes, Francis. These gentlemen have only one condition. - You-You... - That I become the boss. Steven, you didn't! First-name basis? I don't think so. Shall I ask a couple of my employees to help move your stuff out? There, there, Mr. Von Bloodt. Don't look so glum. Now you can enjoy early retirement. You've been here for too long. Make way for the young. What's going on? Huh? Yes. Absolutely. Oh, it goes without saying. - Of course. - So you're the boss now? - You used me! I should have known better! - Shh! Please. Thank you. Yes. I'll put her on. It's your daddy. Oh, sorry. Speaker on. So, my daughter, how is your internship going? What do you want? I want you to take all the zombies to hell. To hell? Never! All monsters belong in this park. Gretchen, we've just signed a pact with the humans. And now this park belongs to them. They want glitter-sweating vampires to thrill teenage girls. Oop. Well, that was a bit harsh. It's their choice. It's the law of the market. If the zombies don't go, the park shuts down. Shut it down! The vampires will sink with the ship! Don't force me to do it myself. If you lock up the zombies, I will destroy everything! Will you now? I'm disappointed in you. Aaah! Your powers are gone, as well as the high hopes I had for you. And since you're so fond of zombies, you can replace them at the cotton candy stall! Go on, you can leave. I don't need you anymore. Oh!

Uh... Hmm. Wait! Maybe this park can do some magic. Come on, follow me. We'll try to send a message to your daddy. And if you really believe it, I'm sure he'll hear it. Young Lucie is waiting for her daddy at security control. Go ahead, Lucie. Your dad can hear you. Tell him how much you love him. Hmm. Uh... Daddy, uh... C-Can you hear me, Dad? Can you hear me? Okay. Uh, Daddy? It's me. It's Lucie. Uh, there's so much I want to say. Since you've been gone, I'm having a hard time. Some people are saying mean things about you. But I know they're not true. You're not like that. 'Cause Mommy, she wouldn't have been in love with you - until the end. - Huh? I miss you both so much. And-And also, do you remember? I-I wanted to go to the park, and... And, well, here I am. But without you it's not the same. I love you, Daddy. What do you think you're doing? - Let me talk to my dad! - He's dead! Let go of her! Leave her alone! - Daddy! Aaah! - Don't! - Let me go! - Aaah! Stop it! No! Dad! - Daddy! - Ouch! - Help me, Daddy! Daddy! - Ow! Lucie. Wow! Look! - Huh? - Come on! Huh? Huh? Oh! Whoa! So cool! Don't stay here! Huh? Huh? Gretchen! Where's Lucie? Hector? You've changed. Where's Lucie? Hmm. Hector, I'm so sorry. Thanks for looking after my daughter. Fellow zombies! The time has come to reclaim our park! Brains! Brains! Zombies, resistance! Whoa! Huh? Ohh! Lucie. Lucie! Shh. She's asleep now. Huh? Let go of her immediately! Easy, buddy. One more move and I'll bite her. Although it's tempting to have a vampire child among us. I'm sure our clients would love it. Plus, you'd have forever to see her. Wouldn't you like that? It's up to you, Hector Saxe. Either you keep your revolutionary urges in check in my park, or she spends her life bowing to the patrons of the haunted house. It's a lose-lose scenario. You all lose! So why don't you just go back to spin that wheel. Ow! Run, Lucie! Run! - Daddy! - Huh? Aaah! Ha! Daddy! Ha! Whoa! Wh-Whoa! Whoa! Huh! Huh! Oh! Harnesses that don't comply with the B-75 standards! - I knew it! Hmm? - Ha! Aaah! Daddy! Help! You wanted to see something horrible? Ladies and gentlemen, the little girl toss! Daddy! Aaah! Aaah! Aaah! - Aaah! - Whoa. - Huh? - Yah! Huh? Aaah! What's happening? Where is she? Where is she? Look over there! Oh! Whoa! Lucie. Daddy. Oh, sweetheart. Ahhh. Oh! Whoo! Yeah! Whoo! Whoo! Wow! Well done, my buddy. That was a class act. Lucie, this is Sirius. He's the skeleton on the poster. Indeed I am, miss. At your service. Uh... Gretchen! Ahhh. Mmm. Make way! Make way! Von Bloodt, the children were frightened to death! You were right. They loved it! Congratulations, Mr. Manager. Well... thank you. Yeah! Oh. There you are. - Huh? - I received your ad. But-But... Aaah! - But wait! - Leave me alone! - Well, wait for me. - What do you want from me? - Mi amor! Mon amor! - No! Get away from me! - Oh, baby, come with me. - Aaah! - I'm coming! - Oh! Oh, my God! So, have you met the new teacher? Apparently she's fantastic. Oh, I hear she is the best. I am so happy. We've been waiting for this for so long. So you didn't validate your internship? No. I encountered some difficulties, Dad. Pfft. I don't care about that diploma. Well, the park is doing great. That's what matters. I'll never understand why people like monsters so much, but who am I to judge? Dad, Lucie's coming. You have to go. Ah. Your friend's daughter. That Hector guy, huh? I'm not really thrilled... Good-bye, Dad. Hey, pumpkin. Ready for takeoff? Yes. Why don't you just pick me up with your broom? I told you, sweetie. Your friends can't know I'm a witch. It's our secret. So, is your new schoolteacher nice? Yes! And I'm allowed to draw monsters. Also she's very, very pretty. And she'd like to meet Dad. Yeah, well, I don't see the point. Are you jealous? - What?
