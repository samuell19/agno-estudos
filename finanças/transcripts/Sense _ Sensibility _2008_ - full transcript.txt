Do you truly love me? Trust me. Mrs Edwards... Mrs Edwards thinks you're a child still. But we know better than that, don't we? But when will you come back? Soon. Very soon. But when? You should prepare yourself. I have done all I can. John. I'm so glad you've come. Is it John? Here I am, Father. The law prevents me from dividing up my estate. You are to have everything. Without your help, your stepmother... and the girls will have almost nothing. You must do something. You must promise me. You must give me your solemn promise. Yes, ofcourse. I promise. Norland Park, ours at last. Come to bed. I promised Father I would... - do something for them. - You are the most generous of men. I hope you don't intend to spoil them. Not to spoil them. I have written to Mary, saying they may expect us on Monday. Blow out the candle, dear. Monday? But that's today I had not thought it would be so soon. - Have they no heart at all? - It is their house now, Marianne. But why, Elinor? - It isn't fair, is it? - It is the way things are. Meg. Mr John Dashwood is Father's only son, and sons are always heirs. There's nothing anyone can do about it. How can you be so calm about it? Oh, Mother. Don't cry, dear. But what will we do? Will we have to live with gypsies? I'd rather live with gypsies than with Aunt Fanny. She's an insufferable woman. If she comes to live here, I might even poison her. I thought of giving the girls 1,000 apiece. - Would that be fair, do you think? - 1,000 apiece? Are you mad? Do you rob your only child of his rightful inheritance? Henry, your father proposes to steal 3,000 from you to give to his half-sisters. You think it too generous? 500 apiece? That would be beyond anything generous, when you think that they will have 3,000 on their mother's death. A very comfortable fortune for any young woman, I should have thought. But your papa is set on robbing you, Henry. Perhaps the matter does require further thought. But I'm determined to help them, Fanny. Mama, they won't expect you to give up your own bedroom. It is their house now. Of course they will expect the best it has to offer. Mama, our brother has a kind heart. He wouldn't want you to be uncomfortable. He promised Papa he would look after us all. Yes, yes, he did. And he will. I'm sure of it. To say the truth, I'm convinced your father had no idea of your giving them any money at all. What would they spend it on? They will have no carriage, no horses, hardly any servants. Yes. I suppose... And consider, my dear, you owe no particular gratitude to your father, nor attention to his wishes. For we very well know if he could, he would have left almost everything in the world to them. Upon my word, I do believe you're right. My father must have meant nothing more than what you said. Just a general concern for their welfare, occasional presents of fish and game and so forth. Exactly. There, there, darling. We shan't let the poor starve you. No, we shan't. I shan't speak to them when they come in. Yes, you will. We shall all be on our best behaviour. Because we are the visitors now. Really, Mary. There's no need for that. Well, here we are at last! After you, my dear, of course. So, Elinor, still at your music? Marianne still sketching away? You see, I remember everything. Other way around, Aunt. - Marianne is the musician. - Oh, yes. - And what about you, Margaret? - I'm going to be a writer. A writer? Well, pens and paper cost very little. You have made a sensible choice. This is an elegant dinner service. Of course you'll have no use for it when you move to a smaller place. - My dear. - And of course it belongs here. - Belongs to the house. - And the house belongs to you. Though you neither care for it, nor need it, - nor deserve it. - Marianne! You know you really can't say things like that at the dinner table, - to their faces. - Well, it's true. She cares nothing for Norland, only for the pounds, shillings, and pence it's worth. And it's quite clear our brother has no intention of honouring his promise to Papa. I know, but... My dears, Mr Gridley has found us two very suitable houses. Beecham Court, and Thrush Place. I favour Beecham Court. Look, Marianne, it has a gazebo. And the grounds are very manageable, I should think. Mama, they are far beyond our income. We have only �400 a year. Well, they're both smaller than Norland, Elinor. Mama, we need to think very differently now. We could hardly afford the gate house at Beecham Court. I suppose you would have us live in a rabbit hutch. Not quite, Mama, a cottage would answer very well. Sometimes, Elinor, I think you don't understand how I feel. I do, Mama, truly I do. But we have to be practical. Oh, here you are all are. I wondered where you were all hiding. I have just heard from my brother Edward, he's coming to stay, and we expect his visit to be a long one. So we are very favoured. - I believe you have never met him. - No. As the eldest son, he will, of course, inherit a considerable fortune and we expect great things of him. Parliament, perhaps. He will make his mark upon the world, no doubt of that. So much to do before he arrives. He has a very discerning eye and I should not want him to find fault with anything. Well, things to do. Things to do. I bet he'sjust like her. Martha! Martha, what are you doing? Didn't you do them a week ago? Mrs John Dashwood's orders, miss. They're all to be done again with the gentlemen coming. Those carpets are clean. Go and see to your work. Thank you, Miss Elinor. Good morning. - Oh, I was just... - Beating carpets. - Yes. - Edward Ferrars. How do you do? My horse has thrown a shoe, so I came by way of the stables. Elinor Dashwood. Would you like some help? With the carpet beating? No. I had better take you to in to see your sister. Edward! The state of you! Where are your things? They're sending them on. I felt like a ride so I borrowed a horse. - How long are you going to stay? - Margaret! I am entirely dependent on Mrs Dashwood, of course. I would not want to overstay my welcome. I shall have you shown to your room immediately. What on earth possessed you to arrive here looking like a country bumpkin? My dear Fanny, we are in the country, after all. I think the first thing to do is rip out this dingy old panelling, so dark and dusty, I'm sure you'll agree. And all these old books, how could a gentlemen bear to sit in a gloomy old den like this? Oh, Elinor. Do not let us disturb you. - Here, will you take this? - Fanny. - Yes, Edward? - Let me explain. This is a library, a place of refuge. Libraries should be full of dusty old books, and nooks, and corners, and places to hide away in. Do you know, Fanny, I do believe this library is quite perfectjust as it is. Edward, you know you only say these things to annoy me. I'm afraid it must pain you to see my sister refurbishing Norland after her own taste. It is her house now. She must do as she sees fit, I suppose. She's doing her level best to refurbish me, too. I'm a grave disappointment to my family, Miss Dashwood. Fanny would like me to be a great man of some sort. Important, talked about, riding around in a barouche. And you don't see see yourself in a barouche? A pony and trap would do we me very well. I want to go into the church, you see, a quiet country parish. But that's not smart enough for my family. I think we all have to find our own ways to be happy. So do I. And I think I prefer your notion of happiness. Do you? Good. Quiet country parish it is, then. This must be a very hard time for you, your father's death. My own father died when I was 17. I was like a boat that had lost its anchor. We must all have someone to listen to us. To understand what we feel. Elinor! - It's not fair! - What's not fair! Henry's got my pony, nobody asked me if he could ride him. - And he's pulling his mouth. - Meg, he doesn't mean any harm. And you're much too big now for such a little horse. It is a matter of principle. You are quite right. I will speak to my sister about it. Meanwhile, how about setting your sights a bit higher than a pony? Do you love him? I... I think very highly of him. I like him, Marianne. But is he worthy of you? He has no taste for drawing or music or anything of that kind. There are worse faults than failing to appreciate your music. But his reading last evening, so calm and spiritless. He has a different style from yours. He allows the words to speak for themselves. Well, when you tell me to love him as my brother-in-law, I promise I'll think him as perfect as you do. 0h, Marianne, there's no question of that. Not yet! He has family duties, he has obligations. What obligations? - I don't know. - If he loves you, he will act upon his feelings whatever his family might say. Marianne, stop. Nothing has been said between us. I do have feelings for him. And I believe he returns them. But, please, don't hope for something that may never happen. Then you're not engaged? - I was sure that you were in secret. - No! Well, I'm sure it will happen very soon. And so am I. Margaret! Get down from there this minute! Stay a moment if you would, Mary. I just wanted to give you a little hint about my brother, Edward. I think he is enjoying his visit, Fanny. You must know that my mother, Mrs Ferrars, has very high hopes of him. - I'm sure he will fulfil them. - Both in terms of his career and his marriage. He will be expected to marry a young lady either of high rank or great fortune, preferably both. I see. His happiness will depend upon our mother's wishes. If he goes against her, he will get nothing. So, you see, any young woman who tries to draw him in will find herself gravely disappointed. Just a little hint, Mary. Thank you, Fanny. I'm much obliged to you. Mama, Mama, it's a letter for you from Devonshire. It's from Sir John Middleton, a cousin of mine. He has offered us a cottage on his estate. Sir John is so genteel and accommodating and he writes in such a warm and friendly style. - What do you think, Elinor? - The cottage is small and the rent is very moderate. We shall probably need only two servants. I think we should consider it, Mama. I shall write and accept Sir John's offer immediately. Without seeing it? I'm determined to leave this house before the week is out. Oh, I was, um... Excuse me, Edward, I must just ask Mama something. Come along, Meg. Shall you be very sorry to leave Norland? Of course. - But in the circumstances... - Yes. Yes, quite. These last few weeks have been very happy ones for me. For me, too. Infact, I don't think I've ever been happier. Yes. I'm very glad to have been able to offer you friendship at this difficult time. And... I want you... to know that I... very much... value your friendship too. Excuse me. Well... Goodbye, Mary. Thank you, John. Edward, promise, you'll come and see us soon. As soon as I can. Mama, look, it's the sea! And do you think that's the cottage? Mama, how romantic. We should have thought to send Thomas and Alice on ahead of us. With a fire in every room, it will soon be cheerful. Who is to light the fires? Well... I could light a fire... I should think. Elinor. Can we really settle here, do you think? Of course we can. We must. Mama, there's someone coming! - Oh, good heavens. - Hello! So, Cousin Mary, pleasure to meet you at last. There we are, just a little something for your larder. Welcome to Devonshire. I cannot thank you enough for your kindness, Sir John. No, no, none of that. I'm delighted to have you here. I like nothing so much as company. I saw you drive past the house, you should have come in. - So, these your girls? - Yes. Well, well, well. How are you, my dears? This is my eldest, Elinor. And Marianne, and my youngest, Margaret. Delightful. Very pleased to welcome three such pretty girls. I dare say we'll find you all husbands before the year's out. How's that? Why, whatever's the matter? What did I say? My youngest sister is perhaps a little young... for a husband, sir. Is she? Yes, I suppose she is. I know nothing of these matters, I leave it to the women. My mother-in-law, Mrs Jennings, is a great authority on these matters. You will meet her by and by because I insist you dine at Barton Park today, and every day until you are properly settled. - Oh, that is too... - I insist, I absolutely insist. And my dear wife wouldn't hear of anything else. Company, company, where would we be without company? I will send the carriage for you at four o'clock, sharp. My dear, have you ever seen such pretty girls? Indeed. You are all most welcome. Ah! Here's my mother-in-law. What kept you so long, Madam? Too much time at your looking glass, I'll be bound. Wicked man. Oh, my looking glass days are over these many years. Well, now! We must see what we can do for them, Mrs Jennings. Lovers, husbands, that sort of thing. How do we know they haven't left their hearts behind in Sussex? Elinor has. Ah, now we come to it. I thought I saw a little blush. No, really. Consider nothing settled, for a certain gentlemen is coming to stay with us who may make you forget all your fancies. What do you say, Sir John? Colonel Brandon. Yes, indeed. A military hero. Served in the East Indies. They say he had his heart broken and he has never looked at a woman since. Not in that sort of way, you know. But when he sees the Miss Dashwoods, I think we may find he has to change his mind. I think he may, I think he may. He stayed faithful to his first love, do you say? I like that. That is as it should be. For myself, when I fall in love, it will be forever. Very proper. Very romantic. And just what a young lady ought to think. Colonel Brandon is arrived. Bring him in, Jenkins, bring him in. Come in, dear friend. We were just speaking of you. I'm not intruding? Not a bit of it, you couldn't have arrived at a better time. Lady Middleton. Mrs Jennings. - Naughty man to keep away so long. - I had some necessary business. Mrs Dashwood. Miss Dashwood, Miss Marianne Dashwood, Miss Margaret Dashwood. Honoured to make your acquaintance. Now, what do you say, Mrs Dashwood? I think he'd do for one of them, don't you? First class. Well done, indeed. What do you think, Brandon? You know music? Yes, erm, remarkable. May I play now, Mama? Of course, my dear. The more the merrier. Your sister plays with extraordinary feeling for one so young. She would be grateful for your good opinion, I'm sure. I once knew a young woman who played with that intensity of feeling. But... I think your sister has a surer technique. I will be glad to pass on your compliments. But why should you not tell her yourself? We were talking about your performance, Marianne Remarkable. Yes, so you said. I cannot tell whether that means you approve it or not. I notice you played the last movement appassionato and I believe that the composer marked it allegro. And you disapprove of that? No. Not at all. I found it, um, original. Elinor! Mama, it's that man! It's Colonel Brandon! Meg! Meg! Meg. Colonel Brandon, ma'am. Elinor! I had occasion to ride over to my home at Delaford earlier this morning. Took the liberty of bringing you these flowers, Mrs Dashwood. Oh. Thank you. They're beautiful. And I looked out some music which I thought might be of some interest to Miss Marianne. Thank you. I think you overestimate my abilities, sir. I think not. - You have an instrument here? - Yes, of sorts. I have a very fine piano forte at Delaford that deserves to be played on more often. - I hope you will try it one day. - Thank you. Won't you sit down, take some refreshment, Colonel. Thank you, no, I shall intrude on you no longer. I'm sure I shall have the pleasure of seeing you all soon at Barton Park. Good day. Well, Miss Marianne has made a conquest of Brandon. There's no doubt of that. Who'd have thought it? I was near to despairing of him. But it'll be a fine match, Mrs Dashwood. For he is a rich man with a good heart. Marianne is very young. 17 is a little too soon to be thinking of marriage. Not a bit of it, my dear. I was married at 16 myself. The sooner the better, I say. She'll bear him some fine big sons. What do you say, Miss Elinor? Has the Colonel spoken to you about his feelings for my sister? Not in so many words, but you can't mistake it. The man's besotted with her. And why should he not be? And is this what everybody thinks? How mortifying! Elinor! You like him, Marianne? Yes. But because he's the only person in the neighbourhood with whom one can have an intelligent conversation. I never thought he meant... Elinor, he's too old. He is 35, Marianne, five years younger than I am and I never thought of myself as being quite decrepit. That's unfair, Mama. You know I never meant that. Most people, I think, would still consider Colonel Brandon a young man. No-one's forcing him upon you, my dear, but... men of 35 have married girls of 17 before, I believe. You do both realise it will be impossible for me to speak to him again? Except in company. Marianne, Colonel Brandon's coming. - Come on, Meg. Out back. - What for? A healthy walk. Marianne! - Really! - I told you, Mama. Come on, Meg. Marianne! - But I don't want to go for a walk. - Yes, you do. It's about Colonel Brandon, isn't it? Don't you like him any more? I simply felt an urgent need of fresh air and exercise. I think it's going to rain. Is there a felicity in the world superior to this? Margaret? We will walk here at least two hours. I told you it would rain. What of it? Sweet, refreshing rain. # Oh, that I was a little tiny girl with a hey ho, # the wind and the rain! # You're mad! My compliments to Miss Marianne and Miss Margaret. Marianne will be sorry to have missed you. I'm sure she would want to thank you for the books. So thoughtful of you. Not at all. Good day, Mrs Dashwood. Miss Dashwood. Won't you wait until the rain has stopped? No, I fear I have overstayed my welcome already. Good day. I don't like this, Marianne, and I'm all wet. This has all been a silly idea. Nonsense, a little rain never hurt anybody. Come on, let's... Marianne! Are you hurt? Don't move. Stay there, I'll come to you. Where are you injured? Um, my ankle. You will permit me. I know a little about these things. No bones broken, but it's a bad sprain. You mustn't walk on it. Be so good as to put your arm around my neck. Go ahead, Margaret! Mama! Elinor! Mama! Elinor! Mama, we were running down the hill, Marianne fell, hurt herself and a man is carrying her. Don't be alarmed, I beg you. Her injuries are minor, a sprained ankle and some bruising only. Here, let me set you down. - There. - Thank you. Forgive the intrusion, I couldn't think how else to manage it. I happened to be passing. I saw her fall. Clearly, she was unable to stand or walk. And... so here we are. She will need to rest the ankle for a few days, but - she should recover very soon. - Excuse me. And now I'll leave you. Will you not sit down for a moment, sir? - Warm yourself by the fire. - No, thank you, madam. I won't intrude any longer. Perhaps you'll allow me to return tomorrow to see how your daughter... Your daughter... My younger daughter, Marianne. To see how your daughter Marianne is progressing. This is so kind of you, sir, may we know your name? My name is Willoughby, ma'am. Willoughby of Allenham. Until tomorrow, then. Thank you again, Mr Willoughby. Well! Willoughby. Willoughby of Allenham, it's a good name, isn't it, Elinor? It has a poetic ring. Willoughby of Allenham. He was very handsome, wasn't he, Marianne? He has a true natural grace, and strength. He carried me as if I were no more than a feather. And you put your arm right around his neck, I saw you. What of it? Truly good manners have nothing to do with convention. I thought Mr Willoughby's manners were impeccable, and such a sweet smile. - Did you remark his eyes, Mama? - Mm-hm. He has very fine eyes. Willoughby, Willoughby of Allenham. Willoughby of Allenham has left some very muddy footprints in the passage. He's coming. Willoughby is coming! Quickly! Quickly, quickly! Mr Willoughby, ma'am. And how is the invalid this morning? - Pretty well, I thank you. - Thanks to you, Mr Willoughby. Not at all. I count myself lucky to have been passing at the time. I was up early this morning, I picked these wild strawberries for you. Wild strawberries! - I love wild strawberries. - I thought you might. - Shall I? - Thank you. Mr Willoughby. We have been hearing all about you, Mr Willoughby. Sir John says you're very fond of dancing. Indeed I am, and I hope to have the pleasure of proving it to you all before very long, when Miss Marianne's ankle is recovered. Meg. - Do you care for poetry, too? - Very much. I see you're reading Pope. - Are you fond of Pope? - No. My sentiments exactly. He's too rational for me. More to be admired than loved. That is just what I think. - Do you know Lord Byron? - No, I have heard of him. So we'll go no more a roving So late into the night Though my heart be still as loving The moon be still as bright. - He is a true romantic. - That is just the sort of thing I like. And I. Isn't it extraordinary, Mama, that it should have been Mr Willoughby who was passing when I fell down the hill. Yes. It might have been some uncouth old farmer who had never read a word of Byron in his life. - Oh, who could that be? - Colonel Brandon, ma'am. I heard of your accident. I trust you are not seriously injured. No, not at all. No, I see that you are not. Thank God for that. Colonel Brandon, do you know Mr Willoughby? - Yes. How do you do, sir? - Very well, thank you, Brandon. Well, having ascertained that Miss Marianne is on the mend, I will intrude no longer. Good day to you. How extraordinary. He's an extraordinary man. Never knew you were a dancing man. A word with you, Willoughby. In private. By all means. Well? What are your intentions towards Miss Marianne Dashwood? I beg your pardon?! - I believe you heard me. - What are my intentions? And what right have you to ask me? I am not aware that you are a relation of the lady. Is she under your protection? - I have her interest at heart. - Oh, you have, have you? Well, then, let me ask you this... What are your intentions with regard to her? Whatever they are, they are entirely honourable. Can you say the same thing? I cannot be blamed if Marianne prefers my company to yours. We are closer in age, in temperament, in taste... In short, in everything. I commiserate with you, but there it is. And to answer your question, Yes, of course my intentions are entirely honourable. You will excuse me now. Oh, I'm so happy, Elinor! Yes, I think everybody is aware of that. I believe you disapprove of me. But how would you have me behave? Oh, I have been open and sincere where I ought to be reserved. I should have sat quietly and talked of nothing but the weather and roads. No-one would expect that of you. But to be so very open in your preference for Mr Willoughby, to the point of refusing to dance with anybody else. Why should I hide my feelings? They are true and honest. Don't be angry with me, Elinor. I only wish you could be as happy as I am. - I am perfectly content. - You are not. You know you're not. Why doesn't Edward come? I suppose, because he has other obligations. Or perhaps he simply prefers to be elsewhere. How can you be so calm about it, Elinor? Would it serve any good for me to be agitated? Should I lie sobbing and calling his name? I think it's best not to hope too fervently for something that may never happen. Then let me hope for you. Elinor! Elinor! Elinor! Isn't she beautiful, Elinor? She's the best present I could have wished for. I bred her myself, Miss Dashwood. Docile, good-tempered, and exactly calculated to carry a woman. I hope you'll share her with your sister. I believe you both love to ride. What do you think of her? Oh, she's a lovely creature. Just imagine, Elinor... How delightful to gallop over the downs on her! Yes, and it is very generous of you, Mr Willoughby. But Marianne cannot possibly accept such a gift. Elinor, why ever not? For reasons both of practicality and property. - Excuse me, Mr Willoughby. - Elinor! Wait there. - Why should I not have a horse? - Because we cannot afford to keep one. We have no money for stabling, for pasturing. You would need a servant to look after it, and another horse for the servant to ride. - The whole notion is impossible! - It is not! I am sure it could be done! Mamma, could it not? It does seem a little harsh, Elinor. If we economised on something else...? We economise on everything, Mamma. We can barely afford meat, and sugar, and tea! We are poor already. Do you want us to be destitute? You have said enough! But it is very humiliating to have to refuse. I think Mr Willoughby will understand when he understands our circumstances. And Marianne, it would not be proper to accept such a present from a man we know so little. Know so little?! I know him better than any other creature in the world, except you and Mamma. And I understand him better than I understand you at this moment! Girls... Mrs Dashwood... - Forgive me. - There's nothing to forgive. I put you and your sister in an awkward position... It was thoughtless of me. I should have considered more carefully, and I beg your pardon for it. But, Marianne, the horse is still yours. I shall keep it only until you can claim it. And when you leave Barton to form your own establishment, Queen Mab shall receive you. Please let me. Willoughby... You have no scissors. I brought some especially for the purpose. I heard a noise outside. Can I get in with you? If you're quiet. Marianne's sleeping. - I was a bit frightened. - It was probably just a fox. I thought there might be wolves. No there aren't any wolves in England, not for a hundred years. There might be some left. If there are, I won't let them get you. - Stop making fun of me. - Go to sleep then. D'you like it here, Elinor? Yes, well enough. It isn't as nice as Norland, is it? It's different. Of course, we all miss Norland... But just think, tomorrow we are all invited to a picnic at Delaford... ... and I've heard Colonel Brandon has peaches and strawberries in his greenhouses. - Peaches and strawberries! - Yes. So think about those delights. Go to sleep now. Now... Miss Marianne will go with Willoughby, no doubt. This curicle only takes two. So who will go with me? And who with Brandon? Colonel Brandon. What's the matter, Brandon? I am sorry to say our expedition will have to be postponed. I am called away on urgent personal business. I must leave at once. Colonel Brandon, you wouldn't disappoint us? Can you not defer your journey, Brandon? Not by an hour. You will excuse me. Well, that's a dashed shame! I wonder what his business could be? There are some people who cannot bear a party of pleasure. He was afraid of catching cold, I dare say, and invented this to get out of it. You are very hard, Mr Willoughby - do you think so little of him? He promised us a day of pleasure and has broken his promise, out of ill humour. I hope it is not an illness in the family. I do not care to pry into another man's concerns. Well, let's not let Brandon spoil our pleasure! We can still drive into the countryside and enjoy the fresh air, at least! Excellent! - Well said, Willoughby. - Come on boys, hop in. Shall we go as a procession, or each at his own pace? Catch us if you can, Sir John! Well, I'll wager that's the last we'll see of them for an hour or two! Welcome to Allenham. Oh, it's beautiful. I hoped very much that you would like it. I had a particular reason for hoping that you'd like it. Would you like to see inside? Of course, I should, but is your aunt expecting us? - She is away on a short visit. - Oh. So if you don't mind being unchaperoned...? Do you think I would care about such a thing? - I hate these stupid conventions. - So do I. It's in a shockingly neglected state. The old lady keeps barely a quarter of the rooms in use. But a couple of thousand would see it restored to its former glory. It reminds me of the Sleeping Beauty's palace. Exactly... Why did I never think of that before? Waiting to be awakened. Marianne. I think I should take you back now. Oh dear, I'm sure they've fallen into some misfortune! Perhaps I should send out. - Ah, here they are at last! - Oh, thank God. All well? Very well indeed, I should say! I would have told you but I wanted to see his house and he wanted to show me. If we were doing wrong I should have felt it at the time. to some very impertinent remarks from Sir John and Mrs Jennings. Elinor, I don't care what those people think! But I don't want you to disapprove of me. I don't disapprove of you. Only some of your conduct. Perhaps it was rather ill-judged... But oh, Ellie, I do love him! "And I have felt a presence, that disturbs me" "With the joy of elevated thoughts..." "A sense sublime, of something far more deeply interfused," "Whose dwelling is the light of setting suns," "And the round ocean..." "... and the living air." Beautiful. Why do they not announce their engagement? Everything about their conduct suggests that they are engaged in private, so why do they not make it public? I know they are engaged. I know because he has a lock of her hair. I saw him take it, then he kissed it and folded it up in his handkerchief. Margaret, would you tell Marianne it's time to come in. How could Marianne allow such an intimacy, unless they were engaged? Perhaps marriage might not be in their power for the present. But that's no reason why Willoughby shouldn't declare his intentions. Mrs Dashwood... I shall be paying my respects to my aunt tomorrow morning. I hope I may call tomorrow afternoon, at about four. First for a private conversation with Marianne and then for one with yourself? Yes... Yes, of course! Thank you. I'm tired. Why do people always make me go for walks with them? Because they love your company, my dear. I should say it is near half past four now, wouldn't you, Elinor? Look! There's Willoughby's horse! Be careful, Meg! Marianne! We're home. Is anything the matter with her? - Is she ill? - I hope not. She is a little upset... And I am extremely disappointed. - Disappoint?! She's never refused you? - Mamma! My disappointment is that I am unable to stay in Devonshire any longer. My aunt has exercised the privilege of riches upon her poor dependent cousin, - by sending me on business to London. - And must you go at once? - Almost this moment. - Oh, what a shame! Of course you have your duty to your aunt. I'm sure her business will not take you long, will it? You are very kind, but I have no idea of returning into Devonshire immediately. My visits to Allenham are never repeated within the twelvemonth. Well, erm... I won't press you to return here immediately. Only you can judge how far that would be pleasing to your aunt. Mrs Dashwood... My engagements at present are of such a nature that I dare not flatter myself that I will be able to return within the foreseeable future. Goodbye. Willoughby! When are you coming back? Marianne will want to know! Willoughby! I think I know what this is. His aunt disapproves of his regard for Marianne, and has invented this business in town in order to get him away for a while. And being dependant on her, he has to agree. Then why should he not have told us that? Out of delicacy, not wishing to speak ill of his aunt. He could have explained his situation without speaking ill of anybody. Then what is your explanation? - Do you doubt his love for Marianne? - No-one could. I cannot understand it. If I were still mistress of Norland, my girls would never be treated like this. Oh, my poor dear girl. Forgive me, Mamma. It was the sudden shock, I had no idea of his going away. I am sure... I am sure he will find a way to come back and see us very soon. Elinor. Can you not sleep either? No. Margaret came in with me and you know how she rolls about in her sleep. I came down for a glass of water. - Can I get you anything, Mamma? - No, thank you, my dear. What were you writing when I came down? Oh, just a letter. - To John? - Yes... No. I was lying awake, and I couldn't get it out of my head, Why Edward hasn't come to see us, so I decided to invite him directly. Mamma, you mustn't do that. Now, why ever not? He is our friend, our true friend, but, perhaps he felt he didn't have sufficient invitation to justify his coming... - He is a little shy and diffident... - No. He knows he is welcome and he said he would come soon. So... If he delays, or if he does not come at all, then it must be with good reason. What reason could he possibly have not to come and visit us? I don't know, but there must be some explanation. And I beg you, Mamma, not to embarrass him by pressing the invitation upon him. We would not want him to come here reluctantly or unwillingly. I am sure Edward would never be unwilling or reluctant to see us. Then please let him alone to come in his own good time. Good night, Mamma. "" "But hearing oftentimes the still, sad music of humanity..." Willoughby taught me that. Perhaps it would be easier if you tried not to think of him so much. How could I do that? He is with me all the time. He is in me, Elinor. You are so strange sometimes. I sometimes wonder what it can be like to be you. Very dull, no doubt. Look! Someones's coming. - It is Willoughby! I know it is! - Marianne, wait! - I don't think it's him. - Elinor, it is Willoughby! I knew how soon he would come! It's Edward! Wait for me! I can only stay one night, but I hope I'll be none the less welcome for that. Have you come straight from London? No, I have been in Devonshire a fortnight. Yes, I was visiting some old friends... near Plymouth. For my sins. - Not a joyful visit, then? - No. Though I have no-one to blame for that but myself. - I'm very happy to see you again. - And I you. So how does Devonshire suit? Plenty of pleasant walks, I should think. Do you have good company? Are the Middletons pleasant? No, not at all. We couldn't be more unfortunately situated. Marianne, how can you say that? The Middletons have been very kind to us. Sir John is the friendiest host. Have you forgotten how many pleasant days we've enjoyed at Barton? No, nor how many painful moments! We're all sad just now because Willoughby's gone. Ah, right. I see. So, Edward, what are your mother's intentions for you at present? Are you still to be a great orator in spite of yourself? No, I think even she is convinced now that I'm not destined for public life. My brother Robert is the man for that. So how are you going to distinguish yourself? I shan't attempt it at all. I have no wish to be distinguished. You are distinguished to us, Edward. And in any case, what have wealth or grandeur to do with happiness? Wealth has a good deal to do with it, I think. Elinor, for shame! Are we not happy? Have we not been happy here, and we as poor as the gypsies? Yes, and I think we might've been even happier if we had a little more money. I wish someone would give us all a thousand pound each! - Yes, that would be very welcome. - Elinor, you have no soul! Perhaps not, but I flatter myself I do have a little sense. What do you think, Edward? Do you believe money has anything to do with happiness? Money can solve some problems, certainly. For others, it's completely useless. Edward? You seem unhappy. Do I? Forgive me. I am... prone to these dark moods from time to time. Perhaps I should not have come here at all. But I did want to see you all. And we are very happy that you have come. We were waiting and waiting for you to come. I am sorry that it took me so long. I never saw you wear a ring before, Edward. Is that your sister's hair? I thought her hair had been lighter. Yes, it is Fanny's hair. The setting casts a different shade on it, I suppose. I thought it was Thomas... - our servant. - He's gone to the village. I saw the logs. I enjoy this work. A man can relieve his feelings. And you have very little help here. - We manage. - Yes, but if only... - What is it? - Nothing. Nothing I can speak of. I should never have come here. - Goodbye! - Goodbye! That was your hair in Edward's ring, wasn't it? I... It did look like my hair... ... but he never asked me for a lock of it, Marianne. I am sure he still loves you as much as ever. - Did he say anything to you? - Did he speak of his love for you? No. What did he come here for, if not to propose to you? I don't know. Hello! Hello! We've brought you some strangers! Hallooo! Hallooo! Where are you all? Are we never to have a moment to ourselves? Ah! There you are! What a surprise we have for you! Here is my other daughter Charlotte and her husband, Mr Palmer! I had no idea it could be them. We heard the carriage, and thought it must be Colonel Brandon again. Oh, what a delightful place. I do love a cottage, don't you, my love? I wanted Charlotte to stay home and rest, but she would come, she so longed to see you all! She expects to be confined soon, you know! And our nieces, the Miss Steeles, will be with us by the afternoon! Miss Lucy Steele is very eage to make the acquaintance - of the Miss Dashwoods, you know! - So! You are commanded to Barton Park for dinner! But me no buts! The carriage will be sent for you at four o'clock! Come along, Palmer! Thats ceiling's very crooked. Miss Dashwood, Miss Marianne, Miss Margaret Dashwood, allow me to introduce my second cousins by marriage, the Misses Steele. Don't you think they're a fine pair of pretty girls? Oh, Sir John, for shame! How do you like Devonshire, Miss Dashwood? Have you found any smart beaux? There cannot be so many here as there are in Sussex? Anne, must you always be talking of beaux? Some young ladies don't care for them, but I think they're vastly agreeable, provided they dress smart and behave civil. But I can not bear to see them dirty and nasty, can you? Erm, no. We've heard all about your sister's conquest, and that Mr Willoughby is the smartest beau that anyone could wish for and prodigious handsome too! T'will be fine to have her married so young. And I hope you may have as good luck yourself soon... But perhaps you have a friend in the corner already! Indeed she has, and he was in the neighbourhood very lately! - And what is his name, pray? - Oh, it is a great secret, but we all know that it begins with F. But more than that, we cannot say. (Ferrars!) We know a Mr Ferrars. He's a very agreeable young man... - We know him very well! - How can you say so, Anne? We have seen him once or twice at my uncle's, but it's rather too much to pretend to know him very well! - I always say the wrong thing! - Yes, you do. Look... The weather is much brighter! I wonder, Miss Dashwood, would you do me the honour of taking the air with me? You will think my question an odd one, I dare say, Miss Dashwood... But are you acquainted with your sister-in-law's mother, Mrs Ferrars? No, I have never met her. I never understood that you were connected with that family at all. Oh, Miss Dashwood. If I dared tell you all, you would be very surprised. Mrs Ferrars is certainly nothing to me at present but the time may come when we will be very intimately connected. What do you mean? Are you acquainted with Mr Robert Ferrars? No, not with him! I never saw him in my life! But with his elder brother. We are engaged. Mr... Edward Ferrars? Of course you are surprised because it was always meant to be a great secret. None of my relations know of it except Anne. It would be terrible if it reached his mother. I have no fortune, you know, and I fancy she is a very proud woman. May I ask if your engagement is of long standing? - We have been engaged these four years. - Four years! I met him at my uncle's. He's a schoolmaster and Edward was under his care. Because he lives in London, we hardly see each other, writing is our only comfort. Except I have his picture and he has a lock of my hair that I gave him, set in a ring. I wonder, did you notice it? I did. Yes. And you promise you will not breathe a word of this to a single soul? Miss Dashwood? Elinor? You promise? I never sought your confidence, Miss Steele... ... but your secret is safe with me. What was that long conversation with Lucy Steele all about? Nothing of consequence. She was... telling me her hopes and dreams for the future. - How very uninteresting. - Yes, quite. Marianne, Elinor, I have a mind to spend a month or two in London, and I would be very glad to have your company! Mamma! You are very kind, ma'am, but I am sure our mother could not spare us. Oh, indeed I could, I think it is an excellent scheme. I should prefer to stay in Devonshire. Oh, what formidable obstacle is my dear Elinor now to bring forward? Do not let me hear a word about the expense of it. - I should like to go to London. - Of course you would! And I think we all know the reason why! And I dare say Miss Elinor has just as good a reason, if the truth were known! - Mamma? Do you really wish it? - I insist upon it. Come, Miss Elinor! You can see your sister longs to go, and she longs for your company too! No more demurrals, your mother and I have settled it all between us. To town you shall go! Oh, Elinor, in a little while I shall see him! - I'm very happy for you. - And you will see Edward! Perhaps, perhaps not. We're here! Well, here we are again. Here are the Misses Dashwood, and they are to be treated like royalty. Any little thing you want, Foot will attend to it. - Won't you, Foot? - Indeed, ma'am. This will be your apartment. It was dear Charlotte's before Mr Palmer took her away from me, and I hope you'll be very comfortable in it. Look... Charlotte made that picture out of coloured silks. Seven years at a great school in town, and that's all we have to show for it! Poor Charlotte. Well, I'll leave you to settle in. Dinner will be on the table in half-an-hour! Foot! Be so good as to take this to the post for me. - The penny post, Miss? - No, the twopenny. Very good, Miss. You might as well come away from the window, my dear. He won't come any sooner for your looking after him. Indeed, I think it's a little late for any visitors to come now, - however eagerly expected! - It is not too late. There... Was that a knock on the door? Next door, I fancy. There! - Well! I wonder who that can be! - It is Willoughby, I know it is! Marianne, be still. It may not be him. Colonel Brandon, ma'am. Forgive... I... Excuse me! Is your sister ill, Miss Dashwood? She is overtired, I think, from the journey. Oh, Colonel! I'm monstrous glad to see you. We have not seen you since that day you disappointed us over the picnic. I hope your urgent business was completed all to your satisfaction? Thank you, ma'am. What is done is done. I wonder if might have a moment in private with Miss Dashwood. Yes, indeed. I'll go and see how her sister does! Miss Dashwood, tell me. I think I know the truth, but I want to know for certain. Am I to congratulate you? I'm not sure what you mean. Your sister's engagement to Mr Willoughby is widely spoken of. How can that be? - By whom have you heard it mentioned? - By everyone... of our acquaintance. I heard it first myself at the Palmers. I came to inquire. Miss Dashwood... ... is everything finally settled? I cannot tell you definitely that they are engaged. Neither of them has ever said so to me or to my mother. But I would not wish to give you false hope. I am quite sure that Marianne is deeply in love. And I have no reason to doubt Mr Willoughby's feelings for her. I do expect, and hope, to hear of their engagement very soon. That being the case... to your sister I wish all imaginable happiness. And to Willoughby, that he may endeavour to deserve her. Good night. Colonel Brandon was disappointed not to see you. He did see me. For about five seconds. He has a great regard for you, Marianne. Yes, and I for him, but he has one great defect. He's not Willoughby. Oh, why didn't he come? Foot?! - Are there any letters this morning? - No, Miss. Nothing for me, not even a note? No, Miss. Sorry. Was you expecting one? Oh, not particularly. - Anything for me? - No, Miss. Are you quite sure of it? No servants called? No messages? Nothing, Miss. No, Miss. Sorry, Miss. But here is something! The Middletons are arrived, with the Miss Steeles, and we are invited to an evening assembly. And you can be sure that Mr W will be invited too. And perhaps Mr F as well! I declare I've never seen anything like it. This must be the finest party in town. Stay, Marianne, you have a lock coming loose. Never mind it, Elinor! Let us go in. Oh, there's Charlotte. Look! Oh, Miss Dashwood! Oh, Miss Marianne! London is full of smart beaux! And some of them very rude and naughty! We have been pushed and pummelled... Look at the nasty beasts! How they preen and ogle! I hope you will stay close by my side, Miss Dashwood. I am in such a fever of anticipation, I fear l shall faint. I have heard that he is here tonight! - Whom do you mean? - Why, who else but Mr Ferrars? - Are you quite sure? - I was told for certain. Elinor, Marianne. It is so fearfully hot and crowded in this room, I can hardly bear to stay a moment longer. My younger brother, Mr Robert Ferrars. Miss Elinor Dashwood. Miss Marianne Dashwood. Enchanted. My brother Edward has spoken very highly of your beauty, Miss Dashwood. In general I consider him a very poor judge of women, but in this instance, I have to concur. You are very kind. May I present Miss Lucy Steele? Charmed. Is your brother going to be here tonight, Mr Ferrars? Edward? God, no. The fellow shuns society. Hate to speak ill of me own blood, but my brother Edward is something of a hobbledehoy. Mr Ferrars. Unkind. Elinor, look! He is here! Why doesn't he come over and speak to me? Pray be composed. Don't let everybody know what you're feeling. Perhaps he saw me but not you. - It may be a difficult situation. - I don't understand. Come away. He will come and find you, if he's able to. No! Willoughby! Excuse me. Miss Dashwood... Your mother is well, I trust? Yes, thank you. And... how long have you been in town? Good God, Willoughby! What is the meaning of this? Have you not received my letters? Will you not shake hands with me? But didn't you get my notes? Tell me, for heaven's sake, what is the matter? Yes, I had the pleasure of receiving the information of your arrival in town, which you were so good as to send me. Excuse me. Elinor... go to him... tell him he must... Allow me. Take her hand. Come. Come to your marks. Marianne, it's too early. Come back to bed. You'll catch cold. This will be soon done. - Marianne, could I ask...? - No, Elinor! Ask nothing! You will know everything by and by. Oh, what a crush of people there was last evening. I don't wonder you left early, I was close to fainting myself! Dear Charlotte should not have been there, so close to her confinement, but she would go. She loves an evening party so. Mr Palmer said he'd as soon be in the Black Hole of Calcutta! Now, what about Mr W.? What will he think of you? You wait a week to see him and then run home before you've spoke two words to him? Come now, try one of these soused herrings. No, thank you, ma'am. Well, shall cook grill you a chop, then? A fine, big girl like you and not eat anything? - Ah, here come's the post. - Two for you, ma'am, and... one for Miss Marianne Dashwood. I hope you find it to your liking, Miss! Oh, dear. Well, I hope he don't keep her waiting much longer, for it's quite grievous to see her looking so pale and peaky. I hope there's nothing wrong between her and Mr W.? Just a little lover's tiff? Marianne and Mr Willoughby are not lovers, ma'am. And the moon is made of green cheese. Come come, Miss Elinor, I wasn't born yesterday... Truly, ma'am, you are mistaken. If you will excuse me, I will go to her. Oh, Elinor, it's the worst... worse than I ever imagined. It's as if I never knew him. "My dear Madam, I am very much I concerned to find there was anything in my behaviour last night that did not meet your approbation. If I have been so unfortunate as to give rise to a belief of more than I felt, I entreat your forgiveness. My affections have been long engaged elsewhere. I return your letters as you request, with the lock of hair you obligingly bestowed on me. I am, - dear Madam..." - I can't understand it, Elinor! We were like two halves of the same soul. It's contemptible. Marianne, if this is what he is truly like, you are well rid of him. Just think, if your engagement had been carried on for months, before he decided to put an end to it. There was no engagement. What?! He is not so unworthy as you believe him. - But he told you he loved you? - Yes... No. Never in so many words, but everything he said... and did. He knew I loved him and he made me think he loved me. - You do believe me, Elinor? - Of course I do. I saw you together. No-one could have doubted that you were in love. Oh, Elinor, I must go home. Can we go tomorrow? - Tomorrow? - Yes. I only came here for Willoughby's sake, and now who cares for me? All your friends care for you, and it would be impossible to go tomorrow, we owe Mrs Jennings more than that. Another few days, but I can't bear to stay in London longer. How are you, my dear? Poor thing, she looks very bad. Charlotte is downstairs, it is all over town. He's to be a married to a Miss Grey with �50,000. Well, I wish with all my soul she'll plague his heart out. Dear Marianne, exert yourself. Happy Elinor, you have no idea of what I suffer! Will you write to Mamma? Yes... directly, if you wish. Oh, it's Colonel Brandon. I can't see him, Elinor. Tell him I can't see him. Miss Dashwood, I have something to tell you which I think your sister should know. Do you remember a conversation I had with you once, when I said your sister Marianne reminded me of someone I once knew? I do remember. She was a relation of mine. We grew up together as children. It's impossible to convey to you what... I believe we were everything to each other. At my father's insistence, she was married to my elder brother. But... he had no regard for her... and his pleasures were not what they ought to have been. I was in the East Indies, when I heard of their divorce. When I came back to England, I searched for her everywhere. Finally, I found her in a pauper's hospital... dying. And she had a child... a little girl, three years old, who became my ward. What age is she now? She is but 15 years old. Imprudently, as it turned out, I allowed her to go to Bath to stay with the family of a friend. Last February, she suddenly disappeared. The first news that reached me of her was in a letter I received on the morning - of our intended party to Delaford. - That's why you left so suddenly. She had been abandoned by her seducer... and she has now borne his child. Perhaps you have guessed the connection. Willoughby. You will know best how to tell Marianne... and how much she needs to know. I'm so sorry, Marianne. William the Conqueror, William Rufus, Henry the First, Stephen. Henry the Second, Richard I the First, and Bad King John. What are you writing? Are you telling them to come home? No, I think it would be better for Marianne not to come home for a while. Because if she came home, everything would remind her of him. Exactly. Kings and queens. Richard the Second... Willoughby's a scoundrel, isn't he, Mamma? Kings and queens, Meg. If I were a brother instead of a sister, I would fight Willoughby and kill him with my sword. Well, then it's a good job you're not, for l would hate to see you hanged for murder. I wish I was a man. Girls can never do anything. Men can ride about the country and do things and girls just sit and wait for things to happen. I hear that Colonel Brandon has been with you a good deal. Yes. You should try for him, Elinor, you should indeed. I do think you might have a chance there. You have it in you to attract the men, if you were to go about it the right way. But poor Marianne, I fear it is all over for her. Her bloom is quite gone, poor girl. Quite gone. As to any... previous attachment, you have to realise that would be quite out of the question. Mrs Ferrars has quite definite intentions for your cousin Edward's marriage. The lady is the Honourable Miss Morton. - Miss Morton?! - Yes. With �30,000. A very desirable connection on both sides. But Colonel Brandon, now that would be an excellent thing. Indeed, I come with an invitation to dine at Berkeley Square tomorrow evening, where you will meet the Colonel. and my mother-in-law, Mrs Ferrars, who has expressed a positive inclination to welcome you. How delightful- that you were able to come. Imagine, Anne and I arrived here only this afternoon and we've been invited to stay for the whole week! Pity me, dear Miss Dashwood. There is nobody here but you who can feel for me. I am all of a tremble. In a moment I shall see the person that ALL my happiness depends on. Edward? - Will he be here? - No, no! He is kept away by that extreme affection for me, which he cannot conceal when we are together. Oh, I see. I meant Mrs Ferrars, the person I hope one day to call Mother! So, Mr Willoughby is married, and has quit the town. Yes, indeed, Mamma. Greatly to the disappointment of certain young ladies, I understand. They hoped to catch him, Mamma, but Willoughby knew a game worth two of that. He wouldn't be caught by anything but a fortune! (This is unsufferable). Will Mr Edward Ferrars be joining us this evening, ma'am? No. My eldest son is staying with the Mortons. - Perhaps you know Lord Morton? - No, I have not had the pleasure. They are a very distinguished family. The Honourable Miss Morton is an exceptionally charming and accomplished young lady. Are you fond of the country, Mr Ferrars? If you are, we could offer you some pretty good hunting and shooting. - Fishing, as well. - Confess I'm not enamoured of country sports, Sir John. Country manners, however, can be very pleasing in their way. I hope you don't take us for country bumpkins, Mr Robert! We have some very fine beaux in Plymouth. I'm sure your brother Edward was very happy there, very happy indeed, weren't he, Lucy? Really, Anne... how should I know? I have heard him say that he was never happier than when he was with us at Norland. Ladies? My dear friend, I am so happy! I was so afraid last night, but Edward's mother was charming. I think she took quite a fancy to me. - She was certainly very civil to you. - Civil?! Did you see nothing more than civility! I saw a vast deal more. Do you know? I think we are half way to securing Mrs Ferrars'consent already. I am very happy for you, but I fear the Honourable Miss Morton may prove a stumbling block. Has Mrs Ferrars not settled it that she is to be Edward's bride? No, you shan't dampen my spirits. Miss Morton may be this or that, but it is ME he has made his promise to, not her... or anybody else. Mr Edward Ferrars. Miss Dashwood... Elinor. Mr Ferrars. You know Miss Lucy Steele, I think. Yes, ofcourse. How do you do, Miss Steele? I am well, I thank you. And yourself, Miss Dashwood? - I am well, thank you. - I am very glad to hear it. - And... Marianne? - She will be very happy to see you. I'll go and tell her. Excuse me. - Edward, I knew you would come. - Marianne. We hoped to see you last night at your sister's house. Why didn't you come? - I was... engaged elsewhere. - Engaged elsewhere...? But what was that when there were dear friends to be met? Perhaps, Miss Marianne, you think young men never stand upon engagements, - if they have no mind to keep them. - No, indeed. I am sure, whatever it was, it was a matter of conscience for Edward. He always keeps his word, when he has given it. And that being so, I regret I must leave you, for I am promised to my sister. Indeed, I must go there directly. - But you'll come again soon? - Very soon, I hope. Miss Dashwood, Marianne, Miss Steele. If you are going to your sister's house, perhaps you'd walk with me, because I am expected there. Of course. My pleasure. To be sure, I don't know where Lucy has got to. "I've just got a little errand, Anne", she said. - "And what errand's that?", I said. - "Never you mind", she said. She never tells me anything. And did you say Mr Edward is coming today? Oh, yes. I suppose you haven't. seen him for some years, since he was at school with your uncle. No, indeed, we have seen him very often. He comes to see us very regular. In Plymouth? - He visits you in Plymouth? - Yes, very often. And why should he do that? Why, he comes to see Lucy, of course. Oh, I shouldn't have told you that, it's a secret! What's a secret? I demand that you answer me. That Lucy and Edward are sweethearts, they've been engaged these four years. What?! John! John! Please don't be angry with me! It ain't my fault. What is the matter? - ls it little Henry? - No, you fool! It's her! Tell him! Tell him! TELL HIM! Mr Edward Ferrars and Miss Lucy Steele. Oh, John! Mother, Fanny, what is the matter? Is it true that you have secretly engaged yourself to this young woman? - Anne, what have you done? - I'm sorry, it just popped out! Answer me. Yes, it is true, Mother... ... and I ask your blessing for us both. My blessing, sir? Pray attend to this. Unless you abandon this ridiculous plan, you will have nothing from me. Nothing at all, do you understand? Your brother shall have all your inheritance, and you can starve on the street for all I care. Miss Steele, you are no longer welcome here. You will leave at once! If you send Lucy away, Mother, I must go too. Go then. I have nothing else to say to you. How long have you known this? Lucy told me so herself at Barton Park. - How could you bear it? - I bore it because I had to. And I was glad to spare you from knowing how much I felt. Now, I can think and speak of it without any great distress. I wish him very happy. You can say that? Then perhaps you did not feel so very much after all. You think I did not feel so very much? Marianne, for four months I have had all this hanging on my mind, without being at liberty to speak of it to a single creature. I have had to listen to Lucy Steele's hopes and exultations again and again. I have known myself to be divided from Edward forever, and endured the unkindness of his sister and the insolence of his mother. I've suffered all the punishment of an attachment without enjoying any... ... any of the advantages. I may not have shown it, Marianne, but let me assure you, I have been very unhappy. Hurry, hurry! Oh, there you are. Charlotte has had her baby a fine boy and we are all going home to Cleveland! I shall go on ahead and the Colonel will accompany you, he's in the drawing room. He particularly wishes to speak with you, Miss Dashwood. I believe he has a favour to ask of you. Colonel Brandon give me a living! Can it be possible? - But he barely knows me. - He has heard a good deal about you, from Marianne, and from me. He knows how much we... how well we think of you. - So I have you to thank for this. - No... Say your own merit. Well... I am profoundly grateful to him, and to you, Elinor. Every time we have met, it has seemed impossible to say what I really think and feel. Yes. - And now more than ever. - Yes. Why do you not think badly of me? You never deceived me. And when I heard... ... when I was told of your engagement, everything became clear. You have done nothing wrong. I wouldn't... think so highly of you, if you had acted differently. Thank you. Goodbye. Thank you. Welcome to Cleveland. See, here's little Mr Palmer to greet you. Oh, Elinor. I keep thinking about that poor girl and her baby. What strange creatures men are. Yes, indeed. What do they want from us? I cannot answer you. Perhaps they see us not as people, but as playthings, Elinor. - Where is your sister? - I expect she's in the library. No, she is not. Has anyone seen her since breakfast? Palmer, have you seen Miss Marianne? She's gone out walking. The devil knows which way she went. Marianne! She is very chilled. Make a fire in her room! She must be stripped and chafed all over. I have seen this too many times. Build up the fire! - I shall leave you. Be sure to make haste, - time is of the essence. - Yes, thank you. Poor Miss Marianne! She gets more than her share of misfortunes. - How is she? - She is a little recovered. She asked to see you, Colonel. Aye, it is but a chill, I dare say. Cheer up, Colonel. You'll see her bright eyes and laughing face tomorrow. She has a very bad fever, and I fear her lungs have become congested. The disorder would appear to have a putrid tendency. Oh, the poor girl. There is nothing more I can do for her at present. The fever is nearing the crisis. Colonel Brandon, I think if... you could send a man to fetch my mother, I think she should be here as soon as possible. Of course. I'll go myself at once. - Elinor. - Oh, Marianne! If you please, ma'am, there's a gentleman below, asking for you. A gentleman? Miss Dashwood. - Excuse me, I have no time for this. - Please! Wait, I want to explain. I want to apologise... ... to ask for forgiveness. Mr Willoughby, you are not welcome here. Perhaps you will hardly think the better of me, but it's worth me trying. When I first came to Devonshire and met your sister, I confess, I was only thinking of my own amusement. But against my will, I fell genuinely in love with her. And made up my mind to marry her. Unfortunately... a circumstance I occurred. - A circumstance? - Yes, an unlucky circumstance. My aunt had somehow been informed of an event, an affair, a connection. No doubt you've heard the story. I have. A child, an innocent girl only 15 years old, whom you abandoned without a thought. Oh, because I was a libertine, she must be a saint, I suppose. I don't mean to justify myself. So, what did your aunt say? I was dismissed from her favour... and from her house. I was virtually penniless, - in debt, without any prospects. - So you set off to London, - to find a rich wife. - What could I have done? You could have made amends to that poor girl you seduced. You could have told my sister the truth. Do you recall the letter you wrote in London? Sophia dictated every word. Have you any idea what I suffered writing it? Have you any idea how I suffer living with a wife I detest?! You treated my sister with cruelty, you speak of your wife with contempt. She doesn't deserve your compassion. She knew l had no regard for her when we married. So, now do you pity me, Miss Dashwood? Or have I said all this to no purpose? You had my sister's love... and now you have lost it for ever... - and I am glad of it. - You despise me. She can never be more lost to you than she is now. She is well! She is out of danger. She is recovering. Oh, thank God. Willoughby. I can still hardly believe it. We were all deceived in him. I think he deceived himself as well. He wanted to believe in his own fine words... as I did. Oh. Mamma. I shall be so glad to be at home. Colonel Brandon is an exceptional man, I think. He is. What sadness he has known. He kept faithful to his first love even after she had been torn away from him. Even after she was dead. He is the true romantic, I think. It is not what we say or feel that makes us what we are, it is what we do... or fail to do. Very true. Marianne! I know all the kings and queens of England now, - would you like to hear them? - I'd love to! William the Conqueror, William Rufus, Henry the First, Stephen. Um, Henry the Second, Richard the First and Bad King John. Why is he leaving now, when he has the advantage? I have heard that the great tamers of horses do it by being gentle, then walking away. Nine times out often, the wild horse will follow. Elinor, I look back on my conduct last autumn. I was a foolto myself, and inconsiderate to everybody else. You cannot compare your conduct with his. No, but I compare it with what it should have been. I compare it with yours. I hope I am wiser now. I am determined to enter into a course of serious study. Colonel Brandon has promised me I can go to Delaford as often as I wish to borrow books and play his pianoforte. He is so generous. I'll leave you to explore. Come and find me when you're ready. Thank you. Come. Beg pardon, Miss Elinor, Mrs Ferrars sends her compliments. - Mrs Ferrars? - Miss Lucy Steele as was. I run into them this morning in Exeter. Married a week gone, she said, so I made myself free to wish her joy. Thank you, Thomas. Oh, Elinor. It isjust as we expected. Nothing to surprise or upset us. And in a little while, it will be just as if nothing had happened, which, in a way, is true. Shall we go in? Elinor? What? I am well, Mamma. I am happy. I am perfectly contented. Elinor... Colonel Brandon has asked me to marry him. - And how did you answer him? - I said that I would. Don't be angry with me. Why should I be angry with you? Because I thought myself so much in love with Willoughby. Because I have given you so much grief and trouble. Because I shall be happy when you are unhappy. Colonel Brandon is an excellent man, and we owe him a great deal. But you should not marry him out of gratitude. I don't, Elinor. My feelings for him have changed so much. I love him, Elinor. Then I am very happy for you. - I wish you could be happy, too. - So do I. I must see if I can find myself a colonel, too! It's Edward! Elinor! Elinor! It's Edward. Elinor! Elinor! Edward is here. Oh, my dear. Mr Edward Ferrars, ma'am. Edward, we are delighted to see you. May I wish you joy? Thank you. I hope you left Mrs Ferrars very well? Yes, yes, quite well on the whole. Is Mrs Ferrars at Exeter? No, my mother is in town. I meant, Mrs Edward Ferrars. Surely you mean Mrs Robert Ferrars? You have not heard. My brother is lately married to Miss Lucy Steele. When my mother made over my inheritance to Robert, Miss Steele made over her affections also, thus releasing me from my engagement. So now you can marry Elinor! Miss Dashwood... Elinor. I came here with no expectation. After everything that's happened, you have every right to turn me away this instant. But I cannot leave here without conveying the intensity of my feelings for you. I loved you at Norland, almost from our first encounter. I could not express it then, as I was bound by my promise to Lucy, but I think you felt it, and were puzzled and hurt by my lack of openness with you. Let me be open now. Every day since I first saw you, my love for you has grown. Elinor, I know I have no right to hope, but I must ask... Can you forgive me? Can you love me? Will you marry me?
