It's Alex. Happy holidays! Wow! I can't believe how long it's been since we've chatted. A lot has happened. So, I ended up on Main Street with Chico in my arms. Now, I know you would be super worried, but I can take care of myself. You taught me well. [Chico whimpering] It's okay. [kisses] Be good. We'll find something. Now, don't worry. I found a safe place to sleep for the night. Plus, I had Chico to watch over me. [giggles] Chico... I'm glad I have you here, Chico. You're all I got. [Chico whines softly] [door opens, closes] Yes, I will be picking up the signage myself, as my assistant is... handing an issue. Just leave the box with reception, with the signage, and I will pick it up. Thank you. Happy holidays to you too. Why is it that everyone feels the need to say "happy holidays?" It's like if you don't say it back, you're a social misfit. So, should I put this in a different cup for you, then? Ridiculous. Did you steam it long enough this time, Rick? -Ten seconds. -Thank God. It's that "in between froth and no froth" that really just drives me nuts. It's like, if you're not going to steam it long enough, don't even bother trying. [phone chimes] You really need to get an ordering app, Rick. That's how you compete with Starbucks. Thank you, Chloe. See you tomorrow. [door opens, footsteps approach] Hey, Charlie. I told you that video wasn't supposed to go live until noon. You're gonna blow the exclusive. I need you to pull it down. Excuse me, Miss? I'm gonna need to call you back. Do you think you can give me some water for my dog? Where are your... parents?

Look, Alexandra, a mother knows best, hmm? [in English] I love making the dough. It makes me so happy. It's perfect. Oh, I have something for you. [banging on door] Police! My name 's Mike Sanchez. I'm a federal officer with the ICE. -I have a warrant for the arrest of... -[sighs] Alexandra, we have to go. We have to go now. [dogs barking] [in Spanish] Listen to me, my love. I need you to stay strong. [in English] It's me that they want. Okay? I have to go back. If you stay here, they're gonna put you in foster care. -I won't be able to find you. -[crying, indistinct] We've been through this. You know the way to Harlington, okay? You know the way. Find Paco Juarez. He's on Old Ranch road, okay? [in Spanish] I love you very much, my sweet. It's going to be all right. [crying, indistinct] -[in English] You have to go. -No! [indistinct] You have to go! [officer] She's going out back! [Alexandra] No! [officers shouting] [officer] Go, go, go! Move! Stop! You're under arrest! No! [ICE radio chatter] [panting] [knocking on door] Paco! [knocking] Paco! Paco! [knocking] [Chico whines] I'm sorry. I don't have any food or water for you. [Alexandra] I didn't have a plan after Paco was a no-show. But I did find a friend. Who, by the looks of it, needed me too. Well... I guess you can come with me. [yips] But when we call Paco, I'll tell him you're with me, okay? Okay. Good boy. Come on, let's go. [Chico barks] I have a friend I think that can help you more. Can I call her? You're not putting me in a detention center! I'm from here! I have a passport! I need to find Paco! Nobody is gonna put you anywhere right now. Let me just call my friend, okay? Okay. [dialing] [line ringing] Hey, Sloane, it's Chloe. I have a little girl that I think really needs your help. Can I bring her to you? Uh, so, Alex, I'm Sloane Henley, and I'm with Child and Family Services. And I help children with all sorts of things, but my specialty is to help kids whose families were taken away. Unfortunately, that's been happening a lot more lately. -Excuse me, Sloane? -Yes? I have to go to the bathroom. Oh, of course. It's right-- It's right down the hall, to the left. Oh, and one second. Your mother's name is Luisa Ramirez. Do you know her middle name? -I think it's Alma. -Okay. But she told me to find Paco Juarez on Old Ranch Road. He's our friend. Uh, yes. Chloe actually called him already, and she left a message. You are in really good hands with Sloane, Alexandra. She's gonna help you find your mother, okay? Is it Alex or Alexandra? -Alex is good. -Okay. -Yeah, thank you. -Mm-hmm. -Can you hold him, please? -Oh-- Oh. [clears throat] -Sure. -Thanks. So, after I spoke to you, we actually looked into Paco and we found his neighbor who said that Paco got picked up by ICE two days ago. Oh, no. Yeah, nobody's heard from him and I can't find him on the internet, you know, detainee listings, so, I don't know. Usually, in my experience, that means that they've already been deported. The best we can do is try to find her mother, obviously, and what other family members we can. Okay. Wow. Well, is there anything else that you need from me? I need to get back to the office. Uh, let me just check. You signed there... And there. Nope, you're good to go, okay? Well, you-- You really are a saint, Sloane. Always were. I'm just making up for all that trouble I got into in high school, right? Well, I miss those days. I'm gonna leave him here. I gotta go. [door opens] Man, how do I always get stuck with Christmas duty? Because you never say no? Besides, where's your Christmas spirit, Lopez? I think I threw it out with the year-old birthday cake in the back of my fridge. Oh, that's right. That's this week. Uh-huh. Happy early birthday, dude! Oh, come-- Don't do me like that. I promise, all right? I'm gonna put it in my phone, so I don't forget this year. Okay, Alan, throw me those lights. There we go. [Chloe exclaims] [sighs] Great. Like this day couldn't get any worse. -You okay? -Do I look okay? I just dropped 15 grand worth of hard drives. You better pray that these are still good, or I will hold you personally responsible. Maybe you should look up from that thing while you're walking. Maybe you should learn how to decorate without... blocking a pedestrian walkway. Sorry. This is not my regular job. I'm a construction worker. Grace isn't my thing. You don't say. [Alan] Hey, Chloe. Hey, Alan. By the way, you untangle Christmas lights by lying them on the ground, not stretching them across an open walkway. Thanks for the tip. -You're too nice. -[Alan chuckling] What? I see you met my wife's childhood friend, Chloe. Intense one. She's cute, though, right? Meh. Well, maybe. Mm-hmm. So, what's up? You're joining us for Christmas, right? Ah, you know, I'm not a holiday guy. Why you lying, Carlos? You kill it for Halloween. But seriously, it would be nice if you weren't always alone. Ah, no time for ladies. Maybe when I get the house redone or maybe when I have a little more money-- Yeah, yeah. You know who else had all the excuses in the world not to get married? -Who? -Ebenezer Scrooge. And look how that worked out for him. But he had a huge pit of money to swim in. That's Scrooge McDuck. Hey, hey, hey. And when are you and Sloane having a baby? Whoa! Okay. I know when to back off. -Ah! -But I'm just-- I just care about you, that's all. I appreciate it. But I'm good. Trust me. I'm good. -Okay. -Let's do this. -On the floor. -Right, as we were told. [Alexandra] At first, Chloe may have seemed like a scary and intimidating person, but once I got to know her better, she was actually really nice. -Let me help you with that. -No need. Just get them back to the post supervisor to lock up. I celebrate everyone and everything. I don't see any pandas. Pandas are represented right here. Meet Perry the Panda. [lowers voice] Hello, Chloe. I'm Perry the Panda. Happy holidays. [Chloe] Mm-hmm. Bah humbug. [Chloe] I heard that. It was the panda! So, how's that little girl you found? [clears throat] Do you have something in your throat? Or is there something work related you would like to discuss? Well, actually... so... that gentleman caller from the conference in Florida keeps phoning to ask you out. Make sure that the assets log is current. I hate when I look at it and it's not reflective of what's been updated. Wow. Okay. I'm on it. -Thank you, Charlie. -Mm-hmm. [sighs] [Alexandra] Sloane brought me to her house for the night. All I could think about was... would you be able to find me? You'll be safe here. Until we can find something more long term for you. But only until my mom comes to get me. Right? I promise you, I'm doing everything I can... to find your mom. [Chico whimpers] But until then, I am going to keep you safe. [Chico whines] [car door closes] [Alexandra] Chloe clung to the memories of her past like Chico did with a bone. She couldn't let them go. There was a room in her house that no one could enter. It felt like a secret door to a whole 'nother world. And it was. 'Cause that world used to belong to her son Adam.

Oh Blitzen! ♪ [sniffling] Olé-- [crying] Olé... olé.. [sobbing] Look, sweetheart, I obviously don't want this poor kid out on the streets, but there has to be some other options. I get it that the group home is understaffed over the holidays. But... come on, you would think they can make room for one more. We can't keep her here. Okay, if they take another child in today, they could get closed down. So she has to stay here-- just for a few days-- until we can find, like, a more permanent solution or I can find her family. -Sloane... -What? Wha-- They're gonna move her to another county. And what if they put the dog into a pound and separate it from her and that would kill her? Who knows what could happen? We can't. Why? Well, we also have a cat who hates dogs. Honey, I'd love to. I really would. But you've been warned before not to keep kids at the house after the last few times. Okay. So... what should I do? What am I supposed to do? You have the power to place Alex in a home that you deem safe for a few days before a judge reviews, right? Yeah. Well, then what about Chloe? I mean, she found her. She's been a parent before and she was a really good one. I think she'd be great. Was a parent... past tense. She has not been the same since she lost Adam and Marco. Maybe this is a good thing then. Okay. Let's think about this for a second. -Mm-hmm. She's a single woman, a workaholic. There's procedures for this. I mean, people have to be heavily vetted beforehand, and you know she's not gonna want to deal with that. You know the rules, Sloane. I do, but I'm-- I'm not gonna just put her out on the street with her dog. I think this could be a good thing for Chloe. You know, get herself out of her own head for a little while. Because Lord knows she has more walls than China right now. Okay, even if I could convince the judge to let her stay with Chloe without a review, then what-- -Don't-- What? -I'm just looking! -Get out of there! -Making sure it's good. [laughs] Come on. -So, even if the courts agree... -Mm-hmm. I mean, they're not gonna let her stay there for more than a few days. Right. I don't know. You know what I do think? What do you think? I think... come here... that you can slay any dragon if you put your mind to it. -Put in your mouth. -But just don't slay this finger, okay? -Okay. -Mm. [sighs] Say hi to-- Say hi to Mommy. Hi, Mommy. Huh? Attaboy. Look over there. [phone ringing, vibrating] Yeah. Hey, Sloane. [Sloane] Hey. Uh... Do you have plans tomorrow morning? I have this business proposal that I would love to run by you. -Hi! -Hi. Oh! I haven't seen you for months, and now I get to see you twice in one week. -[Chloe chuckles] -I'm honored. So, what's this proposal you were so secretive about on the phone? Straight to business, huh? Okay. Come in. Come in. [Sloane] That's good, right? Homemade waffles. Alexandra helped me make them. So, Alex, how old are you? Eleven. [uses silly voice] "I'm 11 too." You don't know how old your dog is? He's Paco's dog. Um-- May I be excused? I think Chico needs to go outside. [Sloane] Of course. Um, yeah, Alex, let me get the door for you. I'm so glad the digital marketing is going so well for you. Why am I here, Sloane? Alexandra's a great kid. And--and... she's had a hard time. -I can sympathize. -I know you can. That's why I invited you over. I... -I was hoping that maybe-- -What? -No. Absolutely not. -Listen-- Okay look, it's-- It's been a while since, you know, and I just--maybe the time is right. You know? They would want you to be happy. If they wanted me to be happy, they wouldn't have left me alone in this world to suffer without them. -This conversation is over. -Okay, look. I just... there's no other choice. With the holidays right now, this is our best option. She doesn't have a relative or friends to stay with? There's no one in 11 years she can crash on their couch? We still need time to find them, okay? And then, once we do find them, who knows what their living situation is like. And then, what if... what if they don't want her? What if we asked them and they say no? What then? I mean, what is worse? No, I... I can't be doing pick-up and drop-offs at school! Okay, I could pick her up. I could pick her up, and it's only for a week, right? And then it's Christmas holiday. And then what? I'm gonna take her to work with me? I can't be following after a kid 24/7! -She's 11 years old, okay? -Ohh! She told me that she stayed at home while her mom worked. I don't do dogs. I will get you a crate that you could put the dog in at night, and you don't have to worry about the dog. Adam's room hasn't been touched since-- Look, I know this is hard. I get it. But you gotta think, like, what would Adam want right now? Goodbye, Sloane. Okay, I get it. It's fine. [chatter outside] Okay, I'll... I'll do it. -Really? -But... -this is temporary. -Right. And you will find her someone else by Christmas? -Yep. -Okay. Somebody else. Deal. [Alexandra] This could be okay, Mom. Actually, I'm feeling pretty grateful about it. Welcome to my home. [Alexandra] Whoa! She had an amazing house. I'm going to get you some sheets and show you to your room. [Chico sniffing] He's not gonna pee everywhere, is he? Um... Chico, you need to sit. Sit down. Good boy! [laughs] You wait here. I'll be right back. [Chloe] Make yourself at home. Um... [clears throat] Towels are in the bathroom along with toiletries. If you need anything, just holler. My bedroom is down the hall to the left. So, um, good night. But it's only 8 p.m. Oh, I get up very early. I get up at 5.30 so that I can do my workout and go to the coffee shop before work. That's where we met. So, okay then. Good night. Gonna be okay. Just don't get me in any trouble, all right? Paco's gone, so I'm all you got. You're up early. I couldn't sleep. Tough sleeping in a new place. The bed's too hard. It's like sleeping on wood. So let's start our day. We have a lot to do. I have some errands. We can get you clothes, some groceries. Let's get to it. Why are we here again? I have an order to pick up. Christmas gift for a client. Hi, Ariel. I have a pickup for Chloe Wilson. Hi. Yeah, sure. Let me go grab it. Hey! Can we get the parrot? Polly wanna cracker? [mimicking a parrot] Yes, please. May I have a cracker, please? I love that one. No, we're not getting a parrot. It doesn't match anything in my house. Why does that matter? Nothing in my house matches. Oh! We forgot to get the milk from the store. I already have milk. Real milk. Not that nutty stuff. I think Chico would like it better than what you have anyways. Wait. What do you mean better than what I have? -Chloe. -Oh! Thank you. I don't think his tummy liked it. [Chico whimpers] [gagging] Oh, God. Ooh! [school bell rings] [kids chattering] So how was school today? Did Chloe get you there on time? When will we find out when my mom is coming home? Oh, soon, sweetie. I'm still trying to find her. And then once we find her, we don't know if she's gonna be deported. I'm still trying to figure it out. If they're going to deport her, can I go with her? Oh, you know what? I-- I don't know, because you're a U.S. citizen, so we're gonna have to figure that out too. Okay? Doing the best I can, I promise. My mom said my dad tried to apply several times to get their papers fixed, but the lawyer just took all their money. The Sisson Group Home is a clean, safe home. Runs a tight ship. Your Honor, they take these kids for a check. It's a business, and that is not a loving or nurturing environment for a child. Which, by the way, if you actually are taking a child away from their parents, that's called abduction. Okay, this little girl is an American. Okay? It's a crime. So, the least you can do is hear me out. Save your sermon, Miss Henley. This is not immigration court. I grant you that there are cases like this that are increasing every day, but that is not my concern. My concern is placement of Alexandra Ramirez. Okay, well, this home does not have a bed. And if we send her to another county, she will be further traumatized. And it's the holidays. I don't see another alternative. So what I'm asking is that you please let her stay with Mrs. Wilson until Christmas, and then I will find a more suitable place for her. Now, in that package you'll see that we've already done her fingerprints. She was approved-- Home study? Yes, it's done and it was fine. But again, this is just temporary until we figure out where her mom is. And there is no other option? I mean, I don't want to send her away to a huge facility if her mom's just gonna be back here in a few days. That doesn't make any sense. Given it's the holidays, I'll allow it. But you're sticking your neck out, Miss Henley. And if anything goes wrong with... -Chloe Wilson-- -Yep, yep. Okay. Thank you. And you have two weeks to come up with another option. I will. I promise. Hi! So the judge said that you can stay with Chloe, so you'll have a good home to stay in while we look for your mom. Okay? Okay. Thank you. Come on. So, what do you want for dinner? Carnitas? Sorry, I don't have that. Can we make them? I don't cook. How about pasta? Okay. I can make that. You should've cooked the pasta before the sauce. It will splatter. You should put a cover over it too. It's fine. You can't overcook sauce. You can. My mom taught me. I'd help her out in the food truck and she showed me how the sauce can get burnt and black -if you're not careful. -Mhm-hmm. -[food sizzles] -Oh! Ah! [giggling] [kids chattering] Hey, Alex! Sloane was held up at work, so, I'm here to pick you up. [Alexandra sighs] -You're gonna crash. -No, I'm not. I just need to text Sloane to let her know that I picked you up. Look out! -[gasps, tires screech] You almost hit him! How do you know that squirrel was a him? I just know things. Can I use your phone to see if Sloane found my mom yet? Hey-- How about this? You said that you wanna make carnitas and tortillas, right? So, why don't we go home, and you make tortillas and I'll go to the store and get you your own phone. How's that sound? Okay. I think the squirrel's fine. Most likely a heart attack. Marco bought one of these years ago, but he never used it. It should still work. Okay, Miss Chef. Let's see how you do. I'll be right back. [sighs] Alex! What have you done?! [Alexandra] Uh-oh! Okay, girls, it's just flour. Both of us could have handled that a lot better. And, yeah, dog on the counter. Probably not the best idea. Get that dog off of my counter. [Chico growls] [sighs] [dialing, line rings] Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on. [line ringing] I did not sign up for this. [voicemail] You've reached Sloane Henley -with Child and Family Services. -Argh! I'm unable to take your call right now. Please leave a message. We need to talk! [knocking on door] Just a second. What's going on? Everything okay? Alex, I have a few things that I need to discuss with Sloane. Can you go into your room for a moment, please? Can I at least bring my sandwich? Sure. Thanks, Chloe. Hey, Alex. Sorry, I couldn't pick you up at school today. Court went over. I'm sorry about that. I don't think I could do this anymore, Sloane. Okay, it's just one more week and then school's out, so... And this is probably not the best time to tell you, but you're gonna have to pick her up for the next couple of days. I have to leave town. I'm sorry. It's an emergency. I-- I couldn't get out of it. -I tried-- -[Chloe] What did I do Sloane? Well, I mean, you did the right thing. It's just taking some time to adjust. -And that's fine. - I am tired. I am frustrated. I do not know how to handle her. When I try to treat her like an adult and let her make carnitas and tortillas, she blows up my kitchen. When I try to treat her like Adam, she--she's exhausted by me. Okay, take--take a deep breath. Deep breath. Good. And exhale. Very good. Okay. I'm sorry. But you have to remember that she was just ripped away from her mother. You know? This is a very--a hard time for her. This is a tough time for me too, Sloane. I know. I know it is. [sighs] You were a really good mom, Chloe. You were. You want me to find someone else? No. I can do this. Two more weeks. There's a Clif Bar and lunch money inside. -But lunch at school is free. -Oh. Well, you left this plugged in. You need to keep it with you always. I will take you to school today and I will pick you up. Why can't Sloane? She can't. -[tires screeching] -[Alexandra gasps] Are you all right? You ran right in front of me. I barely had time to stop. -Are you all right? -[sputtering] Lo si--lo siento. No, no, no. Está bien. Tranquila. [crying] I thought I could make it. It happens. It's okay. Relax. Huh? Tranquila. Relax. [speaking Spanish] ¿Eres mexicana? No. American. Mi mama es mexicana. Oh. Y usted? Americano tambien. Yeah. She was supposed to get me, but I guess she forgot. Your mom? No, Chloe. Oh. I tried to call her, but she didn't pick up. Can you call her? Yeah, yeah, sure. Give me her number. You have it? [dialing, line ringing] [voicemail] Hi. This is Chloe Wilson with Renegade Media. Leave me a message and I'll return your call. Thanks, bye. [beep] Hi, my name is Carlos Lopez. I'm here with-- What's your name? Alexandra. With Alexandra. She run in front of my truck, but she's okay. She's okay. Just I was thinking to give her a ride to the address on her phone. Just, so you know, everything is okay. Uh, my number is 9-2-7-1-9-1-6. Bye. I live close by. I can give you a ride. Is that okay? Por favor? [phone chimes] -[laughing] -What? My buddy Alan wishing me happy birthday. You see. I know Alan! That's Sloane's husband. And feliz cumpleaños. Oh, gracias. See? We are all friends. Though you should tell me how do you know Sloane and Alan? Come on. Can we turn on the radio? Yeah. You tell me what station.

What are you doing here? Oh, I come bearing gifts. -Hi! -Alex, where were you? I came to the school and you were not there. I called you three times. I'm sorry. I guess the music in Carlos's car was too loud. -I didn't hear it. -How am I supposed to know where you were? Obviously, she doesn't check her phone messages. -[Alex chuckles] -What... messages? Oh, I saw that. I don't answer phone numbers that I don't recognize. Wow, you didn't have to answer it. Just check your messages. [Alexandra] Okay, I lied. He was awesome! [sighs] -She darted in front of my truck-- -What?! Alex! Are you--are you okay? Yeah, you were late and I didn't know if you were coming. We will discuss this inside. [sighs] She was all shook up, so the least I could do was give her a ride home. [door closes] Thank you for bringing her back. You're welcome. [Alexandra] I was kind of surprised she wasn't immediately happy to see me, as I saved her the trouble of picking me up. You do not ride in a car with a complete stranger! Are you crazy? Didn't your mother ever teach you-- My mommy taught me a stranger is a friend you haven't met yet! Your mommy must have not taught you that. Besides... he knows Sloane and Alan too. So he's not a stranger. [door closes] [indistinct chatter] [man] Police! [men shouting] -[woman screaming] -[police officer] Stop! Don't move! [woman crying] No! [police officer] We know she's here!

I promise I won't be a brat anymore! [panting] It's okay! It's okay! No one is coming to take you. Shh! And you're not a brat. You're just... going through a tough time. My mommy... You miss her, huh? [sighs] Can you tell me something about your mom? What kinds of things did you like to do together? We would go to church on Sunday, ice skate, swim in a big pool. My mom's a really good swimmer. -And are you? -Yeah. She calls me estrella de mar-- her starfish. [chuckles] She says they're also very resilient. They can regenerate arms and see with their feet. Well, that's very cool. Do you like the ocean? Never been. But we found an old dresser in the barn and painted it like the sea. It had seashells, starfish, even a seahorse. I wish it was here. You'd like it. I'm sure I would. Today is Sunday. Why don't we go to church? Would that make you feel better? Okay. Let's do it. [Alexandra] Church on Sundays were always spent with her family. Now... I was reading online that there's a Sunday school class upstairs, if you'd like to go to that. Yeah. -[Alexandra] Come on! -[Chloe] Okay, okay, I'm coming! [laughs] [Alexandra] And going with me... was a painful reminder of what she'd lost. [happy chatter] Hey, what the heck! Hey, knock it off! Don't be rude! -You're rude! -Just knock it off! All right, kids, let's get started. Okay. All right then. Okay, so today, we're going to be studying the seven sacraments. Does anyone know what they are? For our new guest, Alexandra Ramirez, why don't we give her a chance to go first? Can you tell us what they are, Alexandra? Uh... Yes, Sammy. I know. The seven sacraments are: Dopey, Sneezy, Bashful, Grumpy, Happy, Sleepy-- -Sammy Franklin! This is not a joke. -[all laughing] I got you. -Sammy. -Alex. [teacher] ...page four. [pastor] For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only son... that whoever believed in him shall not perish, but have eternal life. [texting] [pastor continues, indistinct] [Carlos] Careful. You're gonna fall down a manhole one of these days if you keep looking at that thing. We have to stop meeting like this. Sermon that boring? No, no-- I don't really do... church. I'm here for Alex. She used to come to church with her mom. Oh. I don't really do... Christmas. Me neither. Not anymore. Then what are you doing here? Oh, it's--it's a job. Uh, I'm a workaholic, so, if it keeps me busy, I'll do it. Well, I don't know anything about that. Nothing at all. Ah... so she has a sense of humor? [laughs] Was I really that bad? Yes. [chuckles] -You were a little unappreciative. -I'm sorry. I got tied up at work and I was embarrassed, and... I'm just trying to do everything perfect. Why don't you like Christmas? [sighs] I guess it's... a side effect of bouncing in the foster system. I lived in... a lot of places until I became a citizen. So, you're not into Christmas, Alexandra is. -Do you have a tree at least? -No. I threw out the fake one and the real ones are big and I-- It's just me. I can help you get one if you want. I have the truck and everything. Maybe. -You wouldn't mind? -No. I've been in her shoes. You should take advantage of it. It doesn't happen very often. -Hi! -[Chloe] Hey. How was Sunday school? I liked it. Sammy made a funny joke. Oh, Sammy's my new friend. He lives at the group home. Where? They're a foster home down the street with maybe a million kids. I skip out whenever I can. -[Alexandra] This is Chloe. -Hey, Chloe. And that is Carlos. -Hey, kiddo. -Hey. I'm going to go sit outside with Sammy and wait till Lydia picks him up. -Is that okay? -Yeah, sure. -Go. -Come on. So, you're not into Christmas, but you do it for the kid. That's... admirable. Kind. Unexpected. So... I can say from experience, what you're doing with Alexandra, it's very good. You are changing her life. [Sammy] Chloe seems nice. I think she's sad. Well, maybe you can cheer her up. [Alexandra] Not sure. But my mom being home will make me happy. That just reminded you of your mom? Yeah. I hope she finds me soon. [kids chatter] [Carlos] Hey! -Someone ordered a chauffeur? -[Alexandra] Yeah! What do you say we give Chloe a little festive surprise and we decorate her house? I figure we could stop by the store. But I saw a couple boxes marked "Xmas" in the garage. -Maybe she already has some. -Well, let's check them out. Let's go. Did you put the Christmas apron in the kitchen? Yeah. Chloe splatters, so, if she makes pasta again, she's all set. Great. Come here. Let's try this side. There we go, and... yeah! She's here! [both] Surprise! [breathes heavily] [Chloe] How dare you?! How dare you? How dare you put those up? I don't understand. You don't know. You have no idea what-- Take them down! Take them down immediately! But Chloe! I said take them down! [Alexandra crying] [Alexandra] The last pair of hands on those blue lights were Chloe's son's before he died. She kept them hidden for a reason: To bury her pain. So, without knowing it, I had opened a Pandora's box. You okay? No. No! What if Chloe doesn't let me stay here anymore? Don't worry. It's not your fault. It was my stupid idea. [Chloe] It was not a stupid idea. I'm so sorry. That was rude of me and neither one of you deserved it. I'm sorry too. I liked the blue lights because they remind me of icicles. And the white ones that look like snow? We always liked the combination. I wish there was real snow, so I could make a real snowman. For that you would have to move to the North Pole, not southern Texas. I really do appreciate it. I just-- miss them. You wanna try the lights again? Can we? Would you do the honors? -Yes. -Yeah? I present to you... the Christmas lights of... Casa Chloe! [Chloe laughs] [Carlos] Yay-hey! [Chloe] Beautiful. Whoa. It's late. I should go. You're not going to stay for dinner? I-- You're up to it? Yes, I just need to get everything out of the car. You should stay for breakfast too. Chloe said she's making pancakes. Pancakes? Yeah. Blue starfish pancakes. Whoa. That sounds awesome. But, you know, I'll take a rain check on the starfish pancakes. But dinner sounds great. So... is this starting over? Yeah. If you want to. I do. [Chloe] Okay. How did I do? And? [Chico whines] -Needs more oregano. -Ah! -Ohh. -[Chloe laughs] Everything is better when you make it from scratch, but... it's pretty close. -I'll take it. -Pretty close is good. Pretty close is good. Can I say grace? -Sure. -Sure, sure. Sure. Dear God, thank you for Chloe and Carlos and all the wonderful food we are about to eat. And please... please bring my mommy home. I really miss her. [sighs] And God bless Chico too. [giggles] [both] And God bless Chico too. -[Carlos] Okay. Amen. -[Alexandra and Chloe] Amen. [Chloe] Let's eat! Okay. So, this is it? This was where she lived? Yeah. Sloane said there were several families living here, but... this is what is important. Well, so let's take this precious cargo into the truck. [Carlos] Okay, two, three. Okay, okay. Good. Come on, keep going, keep going. -Good, good, good, good. -[Chloe giggles] [Chloe] That looks good. [Carlos] You okay? Yeah. Thank you, Carlos. -I owe you. -No. Was that okay? Yeah. See you then. -Bye. -Bye. Whoo. Why don't you start your homework in your room? Okay. Oh. Not that one. [Alexandra] This was her most difficult gift. -[Chloe] You can stay in here. -[Alexandra] Adam's room. Since the other bed was uncomfortable. [Alexandra] The room with the secret locked door. How did you do this? Someone from Sloane's office was able to get access to your house, and Carlos helped. You said you wished it was here, so... -Oh. -Thank you. Then... I saw your dress. The one that you said Dad gave you in Mexico. [sniffles] Will she be okay? [voice breaking] Will she be able to find me? Of course she will. Sloane is doing everything in her power to reconnect to you. Did he die? The boy whose room this is. Yes, he did. And his dad did, too. It was a car accident. Nobody could help them. And that was very hard for me to accept. It's harder when you can't see them ever again. It is. You become cold... broken... dark. My mommy always says... you can always see the light at the end of the tunnel if you truly believe it's there. Yeah, maybe I've been in a tunnel. But if there's a way into the tunnel, maybe there's a way out, right? Yeah. I think so. We're gonna be okay. I found ribbon. [both giggle] -You call this my white rhino gift? -Yes? I think you mean white elephant. -Oh! -[Chloe laughs] Let's see what we've got in here. Is that Adam? And my husband, Marco. You shouldn't hide it. When we bury things, we miss them more. That's why I always had my dad's picture right where I can see it. What happened to your dad? He passed away from a heart attack when I was a baby. I'm sorry to hear that. I think you're right. Okay. Now, do you want red or green? -Red. -Oh, there's a big one. [Chloe laughs] Great. I'm glad that the budget is approved. We will have two cameras and one sound guy. Yeah, just copy my assistant and we'll get the ball rolling. [knocking] Hey, um, your 2:30's still waiting for you outside. Ohh. Why didn't you tell me sooner that he was still here? Uh-- I-- I'm sorry. Um-- Poor guy. Tell him that I will be out in a minute. Thank you, Charlie. Are you feeling okay? -Thank you, Charlie. -Okay. [exhales] [dialing, line ringing] [phone ringing] -Hello? -Carlos, it's Chloe. -Hey. -Hey. I was, um... what you said... what I said last night, um... did you mean it? About the blue starfish pancakes? Yeah! We definitely have to do that one day. Right. Uh-- No, um... I mean about the... starting over part. Of course. I'm here for you. That reminds me, do you need me to pick up Alex today? If you wouldn't mind that actually would be really helpful, as we have several clients coming in -later. -Sure, I can do that. -But about-- -Thank you. I owe you. Um-- See you. [line disconnects] My mom is going to love this. She always wanted a-- [door opens, footsteps] Oh, no, she's home. We have to put it away. -We have to put it away. -Relax, relax, relax. Let me do the talking. It's okay. I'm gonna talk to her. Um... I'm sorry, Chloe. Please don't get upset. She wanted to do a-- a project and I offered to help, but we're gonna put this right away -in her room. -It's okay. No rush. Okay, then... I'm gonna go, and I'll see you Saturday, young lady. Bye, Carlos. Thank you. Bye. Thank you for everything you've done for Alex. Well, you know, I've been there. -You, um, um-- -What? Glitter. -Oh. Where? -Just here. Well, it's kind of everywhere. -Really? -Well, It does complement your eyes, so-- -Oh, thank you. -Mm-hmm. Well, just imagine I'm a big disco ball. [laughs] You wanna dance? [sputters] -No, no, no. The other way. There. -Okay... Yeah. Now dip down. I guess I should wear glitter more often. Yes. Okay. I better go. Hmm? Bye. [Alexandra] It's like a million Christmas trees. In honor of Carlos helping us pick one out, -can I give him some? -Sure. Speaking of which, he's gonna be here soon to take you skating. You should get ready. Oh, I forgot to walk Chico. Oh. I can walk him. Really? Sure! Why not? Okay, I'm sure Chico would love that. [phone chimes] [Alexandra] She learned a valuable lesson that day. No phones allowed on dog walks. Ever. [Chico barking] Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no. Chico! Come back! I know. Why don't we have your friends over for a Christmas party? Maybe with all the commotion, Chico will come back. [doorbell rings] Alex, hey! Merry Christmas! [all] Hi, Alex! -Hi, Alex. -Hi. [Chloe] Yep, come on in. A present for me? There is a present for everyone. So come on in. [doorbell rings] You guys can make an ornament, get something to drink.. -Hi. -Hi. Wow! Great. Buenas noches. I like your... Carlos! -Hey! How are you? -Come on in. Hey, hey, hey. Thought you might want something a tinge stronger than hot cocoa. Oh. Thank you. -Cheers. -Cheers. You are Charlie, right? How'd you know? You follow me on social media? Chloe told me you have a thing for pandas. Oh. [laughs] Yep, that's--that's me. Wow! She, like, talks about me? So cool. Um, hey, uh... what's happening with Alexandra? Like, do you know where she's gonna live after this? I mean-- She plays a mean game of freeze tag. [sighs] I'm just really gonna miss her. What do you mean? She's gonna stay here. Chloe said it's just a temporary situation until Christmas. Temporary? Oh. You didn't know? -Hey, there is one more gift left. -Oh. That one's for my mom when she comes back. Thank you. [Carlos sighs] If you ever need me, you know where to find me. And I mean it. Okay? Bye, Carlos. [Chloe] Carlos! Carlos, wait! Wait for what? Huh? For the moment that you break that little girl's heart? What? What are you talking about? I know it's temporary. Charlie told me. And I thought that-- You know, it doesn't matter. I-- I know that I said that at first. But I was just about-- [Carlos] To change your mind again? I know people like you-- bait and switch. But when life gets too tough or you feel like putting up those walls again, you put work first. But she's not one of your hard drives. No, she--she's a human being. And she has feelings. -Her mom is coming back. -Oh, really? You know nothing about deportation. It could take years. What if she doesn't come back at all? Huh? Her mom was taken away for no other reason than not having the right paperwork to be on the wrong side of an imaginary line. And what are you doing? You're gonna send Alex on her own. Yeah. Nice. -[Carlos] Gotta get out of here. -[Sloane] Hey. Hey! Uh... Chloe, I have news. Uh, Alex's mom... She was so desperate to get... to get back to her, she tried to... cross the--the river from-- that--that side to--to the-- to us, and uh, sh-- the undercurrent pulled her in, she--she didn't... make it. [Alexandra sobbing] No. No! My mommy's the best swimmer! She'd make it! [sobbing] No! She made it before! -I know, I'm so sorry. -No. She'd make it! They're lying to you! Don't touch me! Get away from me! You never wanted me anyway! I want to go back with Sloane and Alan. -They care about me! -I'm sorry. [Alexandra] No! No! No! [sobbing] And just like that, Mom, you were gone. ♪ This is the part ♪ ♪ Where it's over ♪ ♪ Sendin' my heart ♪ ♪ Down the river ♪ ♪ New from the start I deliver ♪ ♪ Or so I'm told ♪ ♪ Now it's forgive and forgotten ♪ ♪ Ridin' the tide back to your arms ♪ ♪ Try to decide where I went wrong ♪ ♪ Is getting old ♪ ♪ Suffocated and isolated I'm an easy fix ♪ ♪ You're looking to me emancipated ♪ ♪ Baby, this is it ♪ ♪ And I'm not going to stop you If you really want to quit ♪ ♪ But I'm getting sick and tired of this ♪ ♪ Your bait and switch ♪ [phone ringing] Hey, man.

Hold that. Let me just put this... Oh, Carlos, your girl's here. [sighs] Carlos. Carlos, I need to talk to you. I'm busy. Carlos, please. Ah, you know, Carlos, I'm gonna grab some coffee. You want some? No, No, I'm fine. Thank you. I have nothing to say to you. Alex lost her mother last night. Luisa. She died trying to get back. She hates me. -Carlos-- -I know. Alan told me. I see you do, too. You don't get to choose who cares about you. -You think I don't care about her? -I didn't say-- She deserves better than me. You both do. You can keep pretending that she doesn't need you, that she'd be better off, that you'd be better off being alone, that I'd be better off being alone. But I won't... because you're wrong. What if I'm too late? You okay? No. This was the first place my mom went when she came to America. She lit a candle and thanked the Virgin Mary for letting them make it across safely. Any moment it seems like she's gonna walk through those doors... giving me a hug, telling me... that everything's gonna be okay. That she made it... and they were wrong. And-- And we'd light a candle together and laugh. Is there any chance they were wrong? No. No. They made me look at a picture. I never knew my dad. I just had my mom. Now I guess they're together again... without me. Can I light a candle for your mom too? Yeah. Before I ran away to Sloane's, I threw away all these pictures I made for Chloe. [phone chimes] I found out later that Chloe rescued them from the trash and put them in frames because... she loved them. She told me you never throw away something you love. [sighs] [dog barking in distance] [screams] [gasps] Ah! [laughing] Oh, my goodness! Chico, you came back! Oh, you came back! [gasps] Oh, my goodness. You want a tortilla? Let's get a tortilla. -[Chloe] Hey. Chico! Chico! You're back! I knew you'd be back. -I thought that would make you happy. -Thank you. Where did you find him? He came home. Sammy, why don't you bring Chico over here? Yeah, sure. I made tortillas. From scratch. You were right. It is a lot of work. And you really do kind of have to make a mess in order to... get it right and roll them properly. I'm sorry... that you thought that I didn't want you. That's not the case. I heard what Carlos said. I know. And that might have been the truth at first, but... I didn't know you. I didn't know what you would bring to my life. And now, I-- What am I supposed to do? Because I can't imagine not having you in it. It's okay. Don't cry. Alex, can I ask you something? Hm. Will you be my family? You have taught me so much. You have... brought me back to life. I-- I love you. I will be your family, Chloe. I love you too, Alexandra. The judge will see you now. You ready? Yeah. I am Chloe Wilson, and I am applying for permanent guardianship of Alexandra Rosa Ramirez. This child has brought me back to life. When I felt that my heart was hardened and stone and cold, she proved that I was wrong. I promise that I will do everything in my power to care for her, to honor her and her mother and to treat her as if she were my own. I beg you to consider. Um, may I approach the bench? So, my emergency petition to have the home licensed actually went through very quickly, and I'm really hoping to get Alex permanency before Christmas. Okay. [judge] Day before Christmas-- I'm missing my eggnog. Well, it appears that Ms. Henley's unorthodox methods have resulted in a good outcome for this child. I am inclined... to approve this petition. Thank you, Your Honor! Oh, we did it! Oh! Thank you. I'm so happy. Can we approach? -Can we have a picture, please? -May we have a picture? -If we approach-- -We're just gonna approach anyways, sir. Can you take a picture of us? Thank you. Get in the middle. Okay. [Alexandra laughing] [Alexandra] Which one should I open first? [Chloe] Whichever one you want. -Hm. -[rattling] -Mm. -Sounds like dog bones. I think this one's for Chico. Ah, you're right. I forgot to put a label on it. Why don't you try this one? [knocking on door] Oh. Someone's at the door. Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho! Merry Christmas! Carlos! Who's Carlos? Ho-ho-ho-ho! Merry Christmas! Felis Navidad! -Merry Christmas, Santa! -Hello, young lady. And for you... look what I have here! Is it okay if I open Carlos's gift first? I don't know. You're the boss. Not today. Yes, whatever you want, little lady. Thank you for being here. I would always be here if you let me. Would you let me? Chloe, look! Oh! Cool gift! Art supplies. After I saw that dresser, I realized what an artist you are. You know, maybe I was thinking that you can paint me a starfish. Blue starfish, like my pancakes. Yeah, that would be perfect. Maybe I'll paint a picture of Chico. Oh, you good boy. Hmm. Oh, Chloe. This one's for you. -Alex, you--you don't have to-- -No. Please. She'd want you to have it. Oh. It's--it's beautiful. Thank you. I have one more present for you. I can't believe she gave this to me. Well, she loves you. You are a... wonderful person. Chloe. [Chloe] Mm-hmm? [Carlos] Mm-hmm. -I made this for you. -You made this, too? [Chloe giggles] My mom loved the ocean, and when she died, I wasn't gonna finish it. But I hope you like it! I love it. Your office is boring. It needs color. Hey! Oh, and there's three starfishes. Me, you and Carlos! -Whoa, I made it! -You made it. Will you hold it? I have a special gift for you too. It was Adam's favorite. I think he would want you to have it. Should we put it on the tree? Yes. Your mother will always be with you. And Adam will always be with you too. -Carlos, can you help me? -Sure. Okay, let's go. -[Chico yipping] -[Alexandra giggles] [Carlos] Perfect! [Alexandra] We love you too, Chico! We love you too. Oh, you're such a pretty puppy... [Alexandra] Looking back, it was a tough year, Mommy. But I feel like I found a family in Carlos and Chloe. I've missed you every day. You're always in my heart. So is Papi and your love for each other. I will never forget my family, like Chloe will never forget hers. You will always be with me. I promise.
