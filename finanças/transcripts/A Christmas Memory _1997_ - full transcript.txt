He's already too oldfor his years.lf we don't take steps now, what would happen to himwhen we're gone? Think on that and thentell me he should stay. Go get it, queenie! Get the stick! Come on! I'll pet you laterif you get the stick! Go get it! Come on! Go get it! Go get the stick!>> Not too bright, is she? Smart enough not to gochasing a stick just becausesomeone tells her to, and don't you have someplace you gotta be?>> Mama says I gotta be heredelivering this note from herto you and sook. It's thanks for the fruitcake.>> They like it?>> Mother served it to thegovernor when he came for dinner night before.>> The governor wasn'tat your house.The whole town would've been talking.Or the fruitcake.Why do you make this stuff up?>> Just because nothingtheexciting ever happens to you. I went to haha Jones cafelast week.>> And you're calling me a liar? You couldn't get within 50 feet of that place.He'd kill you soonas look at you.>> I could prove it if I wanted.

I navigate by the stars.>> So we'll do it tonight?[ Spits ] [ Jazz music ] So march up thereand knock on the door.>> The music's too loud. They'd never hear me. Then I dare you tojust look in the window.>> I dare you back.>> I double dog dare you. I'll even go with you. Come on. Whoo-wee! That's farley wood, ain't it?>> Yeah, it sure is. And is that...>> Yeah, that's haha. He don't look too friendly.>> Farley wood, you better... [ Glass breaks ]>> I said you had enough! Hey! What happens now?>> Farley's not moving. He's dead! Haha killed him, and he's dead! He sees us!>> Run for it! What's going on?[ Door creaks ]>> hey! Come back here! Buddy! Go! So what happened, item by tem?>> Well, there was drinkinggoing on and dancing and laughing and women in clothesthat didn't exactlycover everything.[ Gasps ] Lord, forgive them. They know not what they do. Then what happened?>> Then farley broke out into a fight with haha. In clothesthey scuffled tillythe whole place shook, but Rachel and me, we thought the roof'd cave in. It was that loud, and then Mr. haha pulled outthis long Indian knife, bright silver with allthis Indian writingon the handle. I think it belonged to Geronimo. [ Gasps ]>> Oh, my! Oh, buddy.I'm trembling.>> You want me to stop? Absolutely not.>> And then he took the knifeand slit it right acrossfarley's throat, I just may faint.>> And then whenhe fell to the floor, haha picked him up with one hand, lifted him right over his head, and then he turned andsaw us at the window. Did he recognize you?>> I don't think so. It was all dark where we were, so we ran like the wind, and he was right on our tailyelling and screamingand waving that Indian knifein the air, and there were dogs, too, a whole pack of wild dogs!>> Did you get away? E we were, >> well, yeah, sure. Ind, [ sighs ]>> The lord must've beenwatching out for you tonightspecial, buddy. I swear, I'm not gonna geta wink of sleep for a month.>> It was something, all right.>> We'll have to say a prayer for farley wood's soulin church tomorrow.>> And a special prayerfor me and Rachel, too, so farley's ghostwon't come back and get us, angry we didn't do anythingto stop his brutal murder. Probably wise. Soul>> can me and queenie sleepwith you tonight, sook?>> 'Course you can.Too, not that there'll bemuch sleeping going on. [ Chattering ] You really think farley'sghost will coming lookingfor us?>> Sook says stranger things have happened.[ Clears throat ]>> quiet now.Reverend dickson's about to speak.>> This morning, I thoughtwe'd talk about the taleof Lazarus and his wondrous rise from the dead.[ Door opens ] [ Screams ] It seems the story is maybea little too frighteningfor some of the younger sheepin our flock. Maybe we'd better beginwith hymn number 240, "when the role is calledup yonder, I'll be there." Sorry I'm late. Had a little too much drinklast night, passed out coldand just woke up. What are we singing? Hey, Rachel. You up there? Come on down. It's me.>> You come on up. You're actually doing it?>> Think I can't?>> Not that I think you can't, just that I thought you wouldn't. You okay? Whatcha doing up here anyway?>> I wanted to bring you this.>> You already gave me fruitcake.>> That was mostly from sookand mostly for your family. This is just for you and just from me. Go on, take it.>> I got plenty of giftsat home, you know. They buy me anything I want. I'm probably gettinga whole of fleet of bikesthis year, every color of the rainbow.>> Then if you got allthose presents waitingfor you tomorrow, you can open this one now, if you want. It's so you canwrite things down.>> You're the one who likesto write. But with all those storiesyou tell about your family, I figured you might wantto write some down, too. No one's ever really givenme something like this before, something so personal.>> It's just a pencil and a notebook.>> But there's thought wentinto it. It's really... I like it. Thanks, buddy. What was that for?>> Just felt like it. Don't get a big head. It didn't mean nothing. You just go aroundkissing people?>> All the time. Everybody kisses everybody in my family. We're real emotional, especially around Christmas, so like I said, it didn't mean nothing at all.Don't you go talking about this. Wouldn't want to haveto beat you up again. Don't worry, I won't.[ Dog barks ]otional, >> hey, look! Ound Christmas, there's Mr. macafee with the mail! Hey, Mr. macafee! Go, go!>> Merry Christmas to you! [ Dog barks ]Y, I won't.>> Just droppedional, your mail off, Rachel. Stmas, your mama seems fine today. Got some Christmas cardshere for your family, buddy.Some folks cutting itawful close, tomorrow being the holiday itself and all.>> I'll take them in.>> That'd be a big help. Here we go. You're not thinkingof leaving us for oneof them military academies, are you, buddy? No, sir.>> Oh, and that fruitcakewas mighty tasty.You be sure and tell miss sook for me, will you? Ng>> buddy, what's this about?>> I've got to hide itmies, before cousin jennie sees it. Before cousin jenniesees what, buddy? Was that Mr. macafee just left? What was in the mail? Please don't make me go! It's not for me I'm asking! If I had to go, I don't knowwhat sook would do. I'm all she has.>> She'd get alongjust like she got alongbefore you came here. You act as if thisis some sort of punishment. Why, most boys would considerthemselves lucky to have even a chance at a school like this. You need a challenge.You need to see more ofthe world than just this town. for a boy, and you'll haveto leave that up to us. We know best. For unto you is born this dayin the city of David, a saviorwhich is Christ the lord, andthis shall be a sign unto you, ye shall find the babe wrappedin swaddling clothes lying ina manger, and suddenly, there was with the angel a multitude ofthe heavenly hostpraising God and saying, glory to God in the highestand on earth peace, goodwill toward men.>> Most inspiring, Callie. Don't you think so, buddy?>> May I be excused to my room?>> Oh, you want to getto bed fast and wait for Santa, do you? Yes'm.>> That's fine, buddy.You go on up to bed.We'll see you in the morning. Not too early, mind you.You're old enough nowto sleep to a decent hour. he's being sent away.>> Excuse me?>> That'd be a terrible mistake.>> Are you questioning my judgment?>> No.>> The boy needs thingswe can't give him. He's bright. He needs more education thanthis little town can offer.>> I can make sure he reads. He loves to read. You know that. Whatever books he needs, I'll see he gets.. I'll spend more time with him.>> How could you possiblyspend more time with himthan you already do? Is that the problem? Then I'll spendless time with him.Eeds, I won't even talk to him if you don't want me to, maybe just eveningsin the kitchen.They're our special times. You can't take that awayfrom me, jennie, but anything else..Eeds, tell me what I have to do to keep him here. Tell me. He'd die if you split us up.>> Now, sook, buddy won't die. Then I just might.Way>> that's quite enough! I've talked this overds, with Callie and seabone, o and we're incomplete agreement. Are you? Ust might.Wayor are you just letting hertell you what to thinks, like she's always done?, o I said that's enough! Now, you'rea simple woman, sook. You only read the Bible and that book of fairytalesmama left you.You don't travel. You don't know what it's really like out there.He's going, and that's that. We have a responsibilityto his parents to see to his future. Now, if you really love him, and I truly believe you do, you'll trust us and help us convince himthat's what's right. How can shipping him offto strangers be what's right, sending him away from everythinghe knows, everyone he loves? How could that ever beright for anybody? [ Door shuts ] Sook, honey? You okay?>> Fine. You go on backin the house. You'll catch your death.>> Jennie doesn't mean halfof what she says. She just talks, and the words come outbefore she's halfthought about them.>> It's like a storm's coming, you'll catch your death.And I can't stop it. An half>> I honestly believe that shehas his best interest at heart. She loves him, sook, same as we all do, but it's a factthat he's going to have to leave sometime.>> Why? Why does anybodyhave to go anywhere at all?>> Well, the seasons change, the years pass, children grow up. That's the way of the world.>> No, it's jennie's way. She thinks I don't knowany better. She thinks I'm slow, I'm a burden she just has to bear, and I guess I am, but my mind workswell enough to know what's rightand what's wrong, and this time, this time, she is wrong. [ Sook crying ] They're making me go, aren't they?>> I tried to stand up for you, I truly did, but jennie's too strong, and she doesn'tunderstand you and me at all.I really did try.>> It'd probably take the whole confederate armyaren'to stand up to jennie.>> I tried [ Laughs ]p for you, I truly>> and even then, s I don't know who would win.>> Probably jennie. We could run away. But where would we go? Not far.We spent all our moneyon the fruitcakes.>> Hmm. Oh, buddy.What are we gonna do?>> I bet they don't even havechristmas in military school. Something told me, a feeling in my bones, that we had to makethis holiday one to last. I wanted to get you somethingreal special this Christmas... a pearl-handled knifeor a whole pound of chocolate-covered cherries.>> Chocolate-covered cherries, oh, my! Buddy, I could live on them, lord knows I could, but you can't affordtreats like that any morethan I could afford to get you the bike I so wantedto give you.>> That's okay.>> No, it's not. It's bad enough in life to dowithout something you want, but confound it, what gets my goat is not being able to give somebodysomething you want themto have, but one of these days, I will, buddy, locate that bike. Don't ask me how, but for this year, I made you another kite.>> I made you one, too. Hope that don't spoilthe surprise.>> Hmm, not a bit.Well, we know they're kites, but we don't know whatthey look like.>> We'll take them outvery first thing. Uh-huh, and float themon the breezelike ships on the seain search of far-off lands, higher than we'veever gone before, higher even thananyone's gone before. Buddy? You awake?>> Is it morning?>> It's Christmas morning, and I can't sleep a hoot. Buddy, do you thinkmrs. Roosevelt will serveour cake at dinner tonight? Sure, I do.>> Wouldn't that be something, our cake on the white housedinner table? Seems your hand usedhoot. To be much smaller.I guess I hate to see yougrow up. At dinner tonight? When you're grown up, will we still be friends?>> Always.>> Always and forever. Awful quiet.How late do you thinkthey'll sleep? Jingle bells, jingle bellsjingle all the wayoh, what fun it is to ridein a one-horse open sleigh, hey! Jingle bells, jingle bellsjingle all the wayoh, what fun it is to ridein a one-horse open sleigh, hey!>> What time is it?>> Middle of the night.>> Just past sunup. merry Christmas, queenie.>> Oh, I think we pickedthe perfect gift for queenie.>> Look, she's heading for her bone burial ground, that's for sure.>> Out to Simpson's pasture.Oh, she must have a thousand bonesstored away there by now.>> Oh, thank you, sook.>> Then why did she need another for, may I ask?>> Oh, she'd be disappointedif she didn't get one.>> Here, cousin jennie. This one's for you, from sook and me.>> Thank you, buddy.>> We learned how to make them from the journal.There's one for you, too, callie. Oh, I shouldn't have told you that.>> Why, thank you, sook. And medicine..>> Almost store-bought. O, >> for what ails you.>> Well, I'm not sure anything can help that, but thank you anyway.>> Open that big box, sook. It's for you. This one? If it were any bigger, it could be a parade float.>> Put it on, sook. Give us a look. Very nice.>> Very, very nice. [ Laughing ] This is for you, buddy, from Callie, seabone and me. It's a genuine military uniform.>> Like they wearat the academy.Very handsome, don't you think? Yes'm. When do I go?>> Right after the new year. It'll be a wonderfullearning experience, the fun that awaits you. Here, buddy.This is from me. He new year. The stars, they'reulgood conduct stars., I got them at the Sunday school.>> I love it. And this seems to befor you, sook. The wind is blowing, buddy. Ooh! [ Laughs ] Oh! Oh! My, how foolish I am.>> About what? You know whati've always thought? I've always thought a bodyhad to be sick and dying before they saw the lord, and I imagined whenhe came that it would be likelooking at the baptist window; Pretty as colored glasswith the sun pouring through, such a shine, you don't knowit's getting dark, and it's been a comfort to thinke lord, of that shine, taking awayall the spooky feeling, e likebut I'll wager it never happens. I'll wager that at the very end, a body realizes the lordhas already shown himself, that things as they are, I'll wager that at the very end, a body realizes the lordhas already shown himself, that things as they are, Will we be able to dothis again next Christmas? Can I come home for it, you think? That's somethingi just don't know, but what I do know is this: Whenever you come back, I'll be waiting.You'll always find mehere for you. Sorry, queenie. You can't go with me. You have to stay here andtake care of sook. She's gonna be awful lonelywithout me around. Besides, all your bonesare here and the pasture and the cat you like to chase.>> Miss jennie askedif I'd see if youneeded any help with the packing and all. Lonely>> don't have a lot to pack. Never needed much here.>> I'm hating to see you go. Could you keep an eyeon sook for me?>> You know I willif that's what you want. You sure love that woman, don't you?>> She's my best friend, and I'm her best friend, and I don't know whateither of us is gonna doon our own now.>> Anna stabler? Everything all right up there?

You scared?>> Never thought of that.>> Well, I would be.>> Didn't think you'd be you leaving today?>> Taking the bus all the wayto north Carolina. Afraid of anything. What's this?>> It's kind of a thank youfor the Christmas gift. It's a story about us be and haha Jones that night, so you'll have somethingto remember it by.>> Hard to forget that. I'm going to miss you, buddy. Gotta to be going soon.>> Where's sook?>> Well, she's just upstairswith your cousin, jennie. She'll be just a second.[ Cries ]>> but why can't I go, jennie, just to the end of the road? Look at yourself, soon. Bawling like a baby. It'll only upset youupstairsand buddy both. N, jennie. Now, you just stay here. Write him a nice long letterwhen you calm down.>> It's not the same. Now, we'll see he getson the bus, and I'll tell him yousaid goodbye. He'll think I don't care.>> Oh, he won't thinkany such thing.This is the way it has to be. No! I won't have it.>> What?>> I said I won't have it. It's bad enoughyou're sending him awayto the land of strangers.I'm taking buddy to the bus, no one else. You hear? No one else.>> Sook.>> I know, you always thought of me as the poor little sisterwho isn't right, like a burden you had to bearbecause we're the same blood, but this... This just takes the cake, and I won't stand for it. Buddy is my friend, and I'm taking himto the bus, and that's justhow it's gonna to be.>> Well, if that's the way you want it. It is.>> Then as you say, that's way it's going to be. Buddy? Are you ready? We're gonna meet the bus.>> But I thought... >> sook will be taking buddy to town. It's what she wants. It won't be the samewithout you around here. I'm gonna miss you, running up that road after school and those storiesyou tell. You are a very special boy, buddy. You can do great thingsin this world.>> Yes'm.

The foundation oft I left home, an earthly fortune. A dollardidn't quite work for me, butt, maybe you'll have better luck. You make us proud now, son.>> Yes, sir. I'll try. And you writeevery chance you get.>> You probably hold meto blame for this, and I guess I am, but there comes a season. You can't be a child forever.Your special friendhas a way about her I guess I never reallyappreciated till now.Her love for you shineslike those baptist windows she's always been so fond of. The rest of us love you, too, though, in quieter ways. You two both get along now.

I won't forget it.>> So many things I alwayswanted to tell you, so many hugs, however much time there is, there's never time enough. When next I see you, you'll be practically grown, a real young man coming backwith stars and stripeson your shoulder. [ Cries ]No matter how tight we hold on, how much we want it, the fact is it'll never be the same.>> I love you, sook. Don't forget me.>> Never. Imagine a morningin late November, a coming of wintermore than 20 years ago. A woman with shorn white hairis standingat the kitchen window. Her face is remarkable, not unlike Lincoln's, craggy like that andtinted by sun and wind, but it is delicate, too, finely-boned, and her eyesare Sherry-colored and timid. "Oh, my," she exclaims, her breath smoking the window pane, "it's fruitcake weather!"
