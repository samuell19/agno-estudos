JAWAAN Bhagat Singh, Rajguru and Sukhdev. They fought against the British to bring freedom to the nation, and sacrificed their lives by not giving in to their temptations. Because of their sacrifice, lakhs of people in the country were inspired of the independence's struggle. Now anyone of you tell me the reason for Bhagat Singh's greatness. I will say, dad. Didn't I ask you not to address me as 'dad' when at school? I will say, sir. Okay. If we agree to apologize, the independence war in this nation would be at risk. Instead, if I hang to death, a Bhagat Singh will be born in every house. Saying so, they hung to death with the great courage, sir. [applauding] No, I will say what it is exactly, sir. Go ahead, Keshav. Who dares to drop a bomb inside the parliament? [laughing] Thus Bhagat Singh is so great, sir. It is wrong, Keshav. He threw the bomb against the British and that is the way he chose. No, sir. Throwing bomb itself is great. Sit down. Whoever tops the exam this time, will get a gift from me. I've come to speak about your son today. I felt his way of thinking is going on the wrong side. He is getting attracted towards violence. Please, observe him. You took care as your son more than a teacher, sir. And thus you came home and conveyed. But with whom should I share, sir? What you said is true, sir. He is into petty stealing at home. He is opposing his mom. I've no idea when he is returning after leaving home too... It's the age where you don't know the difference between good and bad. Put him on the right path in whatever possible way, sir. See you. [gate creaking] Hey, you are degrading my prestige! I am in a bad state that others are coming home and advising about you. Your education, roaming, your marks, complaints on you... what is all this? Do you have any shame? Look at Jai in the opposite house and learn, idiot! Why did you get me to school at this hour? I forgot my bag in school. You sit on the wall, I will go and bring. Ok. Hey! Hey! Stop. What is it in the hands? Hey, stop! Hey, stop! Hey! Hey stop, Hey, give your hand. Where is the bag? Hey, I came for the question paper. Question paper? I will not help if you are stealing the question paper. Hey, he would hit both of us. Either he scolds or hits, I will not do a mistake. Stop. Stop. I will catch you wherever you go. You cannot escape from me. What is this stealing? You dad said he will give a pen to the topper, right? Hmm. That's why, I stole the question paper. You should study if it is for pen, but how if you steal? You are doing a mistake. It is not wrong to seek whatever you want regardless of any means. Hey, it all goes well by praying to this God. I brought you here so that you can pray to top the exam. Hey, do you have a rupee? For what? I will offer to God. Hey, what is this? It is a sin, right? What do you mean? Didn't God permit to take it? Those are not yours, right? Then whose are those? Is it yours or someone else's? This is God's money and that means it's everyone's. Let's go. Congratulations. Thank you, sir. Keep it up. Working hard would fetch you only one pen, but if you decide to get it by all means, you'll get two. Have you bought with what you stole yesterday? What if it is so? The pen is important. Do not commit so. Have you stolen? Do you have any problem? Wait, I will inform to sir. Sir, this fellow... -Hey Keshav, stop... No! -[groans] -Sir... -Hey Keshav! What is this rude behaviour? He is the guy who took the question paper the other day, sir. Even this boy was by his side. Jai, did you see? It is like you too did a mistake by not telling about what you saw. Answer me. Is this the way you raise a child? He has no sense and what happened to you? Take the TC and leave. We cannot do any more. We settled here for his studies. He has gone wayward completely. We will put him in a hostel now. -See you, sir. -Okay. Hey, change at least now. They join you in a hostel when you are a child and then in jail, if the same mistake is repeated when you grew up. Listen to me, please. I will do what I feel like doing. I will go so far away that you cannot reach me. Devotion to the nation for RSS is like the devotion to God. Like we have Army for the border security, we have RSS for the internal security. Keeping the RSS values on top, Jai has secured gold medal in Nuclear Physics. My congratulations to him. I should thank two people. My dad, who taught me to love the family, and the RSS, who taught me to love the nation. With the intention that my education should be helpful to the nation, It's my goal to work at DRDO. DRDO. Defense Research and Development Organization. The organisation that supplies arms and requirements... ...to the soldiers fighting on the borders of our nation. The only word which encourages me is... ...as Swamy Vivekananda said "Arise, awake and do not stop until you reach your goal" Jai Hind! "One is needed per family and should jump readily into the war" "You should safeguard as the lid to the eye, you become a soldier" "One is needed per family and should jump readily into the war" "You should safeguard as the lid to the eye, you become a soldier" "Now every heart says just the national anthem" "You just become the soldier every time" "Now every heart says just the national anthem" "You just become the soldier every time" "You have the courage, march ahead and be a soldier" [bashing] "We will not leave in trouble and instead face it" "In the war, his body, soul and mind sing the national anthem" "One is needed per family and should jump readily into the war" "You should safeguard as the lid to the eye, you become a soldier" [chaos] [glass shattering] "Live in fear, leave the fear," "Fight with self, break the shackles" "Bear the wound, live or die, always say hail to the nation" "Soldier... everyone is a soldier" "Soldier... everyone is a soldier" "Every day is a war for you and it's worthless if you compromise" "Soldier... Soldier..." "Flag is your courage, victory is its goal" "Soldier..." "Soldier..." "Walk, do not search for anyone, you are the boss for the courage" "Walk not fearing to the thunder, give life to the land you are born in" "Show your courage and fighting spirit, become a soldier" "We will not leave in trouble and instead face it" "In the war, his body, soul and mind sing the national anthem" "Do what you thought immediately, look at the goal now," "Truth always prevails on your shoulder in patriotism" "One is needed per family and should jump readily into the war" "You should safeguard as the lid to the eye, you become a soldier" Cheers! Iqbal. It is been seven years since we met for the first time. We did total five deals and no failure. Bomb blasting, bank robbery, assassinations... Police have not even one clue. Impeccable. In fact I struggled to meet you. The last operation we did is in interpol investigation. And thus we are meeting after checking point to point. There is no police record, none knows the face or trace of finger print. It is impossible to catch you. But, the deal I am giving now is the mom of all deals. Five hundred crores. But, I doubt whether your friend takes it up or not. Why? This time we aimed at the Indian Government. It is tough to do this deal if you have an emotion that you are from India. The only emotion I have is... Money. Either I aim India or Pakistan, family or a friend, my emotion is only money. The world surrenders to money. So, I need so much money that the world bows to me. Go ahead. DRDO designed a weapon for the Indian army. The product is ready and it is the most prestigious. A missile launcher of the suitcase size. Octopus. Most powerful and futuristic. At present it is in Hyderabad DRDO. That should be in our hands even before the army. We should use that even before India does. We should use it in India. Five hundred crores. Who gave the deal? It's not your business. But one thing, I am saying even before you agreed the deal. If the plan fails, leaks or anyone suspects us none of us would be alive. The deal is on. Hold the book correctly. Vijay, what all missiles are done in DRDO and when? Agni 89, Prudhvi 94, Trishul 92, Akash 90, Shourya 2011, and Brahmos 2001. [sighs] I going through all the books which I never touched... ...in my life because of his craziness. Do you know I did not even read so many even when I prepared for IAS? -Hey... -Yes, what is IBCM? It's not IBCM, it's ICBM. Inter Continental Ballistic Missile. Hey! Why are you troubling us for your DRDO exam? Hey, DRDO is not an exam but it is my dream. If there is loyalty in your dreams, then the whole world will support you to achieve it. This is said by a great poet. I believe that you will definitely get this job. Why have you kept it hidden? Open it. Hey, we have been watching from the time we cleared our 10th standard. We achieve something and uncle brings us sweets. Have it. -Hey. -Uncle. By the way, why have you not come for Army fund collection? Actually, I had some personal work and thus... That means you don't have time to shave either. -Dear. -Yes. Every one of us will have a goal, but a common goal for all of us is this nation. When the nation needs us, we should forget everything and come forward. That's the only way to get everyone together. This is the great moral taught by the RSS people. -Guys, please excuse us for a while. -Let's go. Hey! I guarantee you this job. I will arrange your marriage as well. By the way, I have even identified a nice girl for you. -I am sure you will like her. -Come on, uncle. Don't be shy. [birds chirping] [vehicle arriving] [Tollywood song playing] Hey, what is that? How should you sit? Waist should be at 90 degrees, right? In unison: Sorry, uncle. Sister-in-law, see how they threw all the books? Why don't you say them? Listen to what uncle says. How much is 7 multiplied by 8? Huh? That is... It will come uncle, it will. Of course, when get bashed. What is your age and what is the song that you are listening? Who is the Prime Minister of India? Who is the Prime Minister of India? Who is the new President of USA? You will get it if you concentrate on your books rather than my face. Idiots! This is always the same. He asks but never let us answer it. This is better, sister. He asks a new question again if we answer it. Listen, son. Go, get the list. -Have coffee and go. -I will have once I am back. Uncle should be like a brother, but why did he become like Bhallala Deva, sister? However, everything should happen at the right age. At the time when he should roam around with girls on his bike, he's been roaming around with a grocery list given by his mom and hence it would be like this. Frustation! Sir, lift sir. Please, sir. -Sir, can you give lift till Ameerpet? -Please, come. Lift, please. Why would he give me a lift when such a beautiful girl has asked? Actually he asked first. -Thank you, sir. -You are welcome. Excuse me. Actually, I am a girl and it is about to rain. Try to understand, please... [thundering] Actually, it's a girl and it is about to rain and she is alone. Why do you need all these excuses? Just take her. Thank you. Will you? Just move back a bit. It's okay, move a bit back. Oh, no! It's not like that, boss. Move back further back. Hold the bag. One gear at the front and three gears at back, right? Hmm. [thundering] Where do you want to go, madam? I like riding the bike when it is raining. So, we shall decide after the rain stops. -Do you have girlfriends? -What? -Girlfriends. -No. How many girls did you have on your back seat so far? None other than my mom. Am I the first? Yes, you are first one. Are you a gay? Oh no, I am not gay. Sorry. I used to think boys apply breaks intentionally. But there was a pothole. Okay. Bye. Do you live here? Why? Will you start stalking me from tomorrow? No, there is nothing like that. I am like a cyclone and you are like a hut. Hut flies away when cyclone occurs. But nothing happens to cyclone. Understood? Okay, bye. Cyclone is good but it's a bit plump. [chanting] Give this dosa to brother. [indistinct voices] Which metal evaporates from solid-state without being liquid? Sodium. 8085 is how many bit processor? 8 bit processor, dad. Coldest planet in the universe? [indistinct voices] Pluto. Dad, this is not proven yet so, they will not ask that question. Answer it. Bankers algorithm is used for? Deadlock avoidance. Global warming is due to? Sister, why is grandpa posing all familiar questions to uncle? Grandpa likes uncle and thus he asks only the questions which uncle can answer. Oh! Give it to me, dad. It's okay but what are the dates of the second world war? Dad, I am not going for a teacher job interview, but for the scientist interview in DRDO. They will not ask all those. -See you, dad. -Bye. -All the best. -Thank you, dad. -Jai. -Yes. One minute. -Take it and fill the fuel. -Okay, brother. -Visit the Hanuman temple on the way. -Okay. Son... Mom, you could've put a smaller one, right? See how big it is looking on him. -No problem, dear. -All the best, Jai. Thanks, sister-in-law. We get scolding when we go for exams but he gets blessings before his exams. What are the dates of second world war? Perfect Mr. Jai. We have no reasons to not select you. Usually, we don't share the reasons and results. But we wanted to tell you. We have already selected another candidate who is elder to you. Your selection at present is in indefinite pending. Best of luck. Jai. Nothing, son. I earned whatever I could as a teacher. I have put up some business the elder one and he is taking care of that. I did fixed deposit for your sister and that will be enough for her marriage. This house... Okay, let's think that it wasn't built. You do something with this money... Dad, either call me as a bad guy or spoilt, I will consider it as your opinion. But please do not think of me as a loser. I feel very sad. If we miss something in life that doesn't mean we are unfit for anything. It is that we are fit for something more. I think bigger things are awaiting for you in life. -All the very best, son. -Thank you, dad. Thank you, sir [aeroplane whooshing] As you asked, Yogi has arranged the stay in a commonplace. He assigned five guys with no criminal records at all. -We have their entire family details. -Hmm. If anybody backstabs us, we warned them to kill their family. KM 357 LJ 546 weapons and arrange even Gopro cameras. Yeah, I will take care. So, this is the security set up of DRDO. To enter this, either we have to be an employee, or an official visitor from defence or Central Government employment. Plan A, one of us enters in as an official visitor. To have complete access, we need an all-access pass. Such pass carries a stamp from the defence ministry. Shall we set any stamp expert? Uh-huh! Regular experts cannot make that stamp. They used to make that with ivory handle and leather base in the 1950s. It is very unique. Later even when other materials like rubber stamps came in use, same stamps are still being used for important matters. Those who make those stamps have now retired and running their shop. As per Yogi's information, an employee is in the Charminar area. Let's give him a try. Usually, the area will be crowded on Monday morning. They may make if asked casually. -You go on the next Monday. -Okay, sir. -Both of you follow him. -Okay, sir. -You take cell phones. -Okay. -You take the prepaid sims. -Okay. Once we get the pass, you will enter inside. INORBIT -Are you following me? -Are you following me? I asked first... I asked first... -Bhargavi. -Jai. Did I ask? I am a painter. [lift beeps] Don't you do anything? Oh, so you are jobless! Say something. Are you married? Huh? Am I not looking young? How could you say that? Oh! That means you have a boyfriend. Tsk! Is it about love? Do you have any experience? Huh? I mean, stopping a bike in the rain and getting over the bike of others... "Did I invent a new person in me?" "A cyclone is rising inside" "I've been falling despite holding onto something" "I'm becoming alone despite surrounded by many" What is this suffering? "Is it yes or no, want or don't?" "Can I not name this?" "Is it yes or no, want or don't?" "Can I not name this?" "Is it because I'm not as earlier and changed a lot?" "Can't I hide it silently in my heart?" "What is this so confusing?" "Why does it seem so better?" "What is this story without an end?" "Why does it seem so beautiful?" "I thought I knew everything in me for all these days" "I am coming along you today just be seeing me within you" "Will my head turn aside when you are before me despite insisting?" "I've been getting trapped despite thinking that I've been warding it" "What is this suffering...?" "It's another universe with equal halves" "It's a great pleasure with equal halves" "We both are equal halves" "You are one half and I am another half" "Our inner thoughts are equal halves" "Let us take each an equal half" "We are equal halves all the while" "You are one half and I am another half" Bhargavi, from now on, we will meet here only. -Really? -Hmm. How romantic! Until I get clarity about myself, I don't like to introduce you to my friends and family. -How boring! -You may leave if you feel so. [camera captures] [music mutes voice] "I will turn as the lips for words and sleep for your eyes" "No matter where you are, I will appear before you" "And I will console you if you are disturbed" "Your nuisance is delightful like the boat in the river of smiles" "Won't you leave me even in my dreams?" "Form a bond with me cooking a story" "Will my head turn aside when you are before me?" "I've been getting trapped despite thinking that I've been warding it" "What is this suffering...?" "It's another universe with equal halves" "It's a great pleasure with equal halves" "We both are equal halves" "You are one half and I am another half" "Our inner thoughts are equal halves" "Let us take each an equal half" "We are equal halves all the while" "You are one half and I am another half" [music mutes voice] [music mutes voice] -There is a boy named Jai. -Hmm. -He is a gold medalist. -Oh! -He suits well for our girl. -Oh. I know him. Sure, sir. If you can send the photo once... Come on, he looks good. So fast? French class is over dear. I should go home now. What's with the French class? I inform at home that I'd be attending a French class as an excuse to come here. Oh! [phone ringing] Yes, uncle. -Hey dear. -Yes. I will introduce that girl. Shall I ask her to come in the evening? Not now, uncle. In fact, I have something to talk to you about it. I meet you tomorrow. Okay. Bye. [siren] Jai Bharat stamp shop. -Uncle. -Yes. You should make this stamp. -This is a Government stamp. -I will pay you, uncle. It's like making me commit a bigger mistake by paying me high. I will not do. Uncle, there are a lot of men like you here. Hey...! Hey...! He is asking to make some Government stamp. Hey, catch that fellow. [indistinct voices] Hey catch him! [indistinct voices] Leave...! Sir, I do not know anything. Please let me go. Who the hell are you and what have you done? -Sir, I do not know anything. -Tell me. Please try to understand. Sir, he came for fake stamp. Sir, I do not know anything. Please let me go. When I declined, he stared at me and said he can get it done from somewhere else. -Sir. -Why do you need a fake stamp? Our sir asked me to get it. Give his number. -Tell me! -9912526277. It says wrong number...! Tell me the correct number. Tell me, who do you work for? Tell me, who do you work for? -Come on, tell me. -Sir. -Sir... -Tell me. [groans] [chaos] [indistinct voices] Hey, stop. Stop. [tyres screeching] [thud] [groans] [glass shattering] Hey stop! Answer me... Why did you hit him? Answer me! Come on, get up! Get up! [siren] Hey, what happened? He has hit a man intentionally, sir. [mute gestures] He is acting, sir. I doubt that he can speak. Sir, we are not sure if he is alive or not. -What is your name? -Jai. Will you come to station? I will, sir. Shucks! Dubai Dirham are transferred to Hong Kong address. We want to know the progress. The dealers are in hurry. Once we get the pass, our guy will enter the DRDO. There starts our plan. Okay. Delete your Skype account. I will send a new IP address for the next call. -Will be waiting for you. -See you. Friend. Wahab has been captured by the police. Get him out. Let's start plan B. A person died in a road accident near Charminar area. He is definitely not dumb. I'm sure. [playing news on television] Moreover, he hit purposefully. It's clear how careless is our department working as he got bail. Open the door. Open the door. How dare you to get my guy arrested when he came for the stamp yesterday? Open the door. [knocking the door] Hey! Open the door. UNCLE Even uncle said yesterday that he had come for an important stamp. -Where is the stamp? -What do you mean? Where is the DRDO stamp? I won't make such stamps. Come on, make it. [knife swishes] Come on. -I will kill you if don't do it. -Remove your hand! Come on, do it...! Do it. Do it. I will go to the police station tomorrow and check the progress on the investigation. [phone ringing] ...is not answering. Please... -Hey! -Hmm. There are multiple missed calls from uncle. He does not call so many times unless it is important. -I will go to him once. -Okay. [door knocking] Uncle... Yes. Uncle... I'm Jai, open the door. Uncle, open the door. Uncle, open the door. Uncle! [door creaking] What is that stamp, uncle? In DRDO it's the stamp that allows you the access to all the places, which is under the control of Defense Ministry. Having that one has permission to move anywhere inside. There must be some secret reason for him to get it. Whenever the country needs us, we should forget everything and come forward. Despite losing his life, uncle has not let that stamp fall in their hands. What is such an important matter in that? I should know what it is. Go forward. -From where? -From Delhi. [device beeps] Okay. [dog barking] -Welcome to DRDO, sir. -It is my pleasure. We have been waiting for this day. -Everything is on standby inside. -Hmm. Everything is as per plan. Good morning, sir. The project is finally ready. It's four years' hard work. Project 3. Our biggest achievement so far. Excuse me, where are you going? Cafeteria. That is the cafeteria. Thanks. -Can I have your pen, please? -Yeah! Thank you. -You are from? -Project 3. So, you are saying that it is ready for dispatch. Bro, who is going to Delhi in the main train? Project 3. Our biggest achievement so far. I am going out on 23rd and 24th on duty and I cannot attend the wedding. Dear friends! Government decided to close down DRDO, which did a great services to the nation and the army. If you forward this message to all of your friends, it has a chance to reach out to the government and to change its decision. Please forward this message. Jai Hind. Dad, is DRDO shutting down? Keep quiet and have food. [message beeps] Here, I am getting the message of our DRDO shutting down. Hey idiot! DRDO is doing a huge project called Octopus. It is a big thing. We are going to deliver it soon. Why would we shut down? My dad is a senior scientist in DRDO. DRDO is doing a missile project named Octopus most prestigiously. Do not spread such fake news unnecessarily. My message took a full circle. I don't know how... ...the social media got to know that Octopus is being dispatched to Delhi. It should come into our hands even before that reaches the Government. Collect all its security details along with the route map, it is going to travel. [music mutes voice] Hey, it's Jai. He denied coming to the temple then how come he is here? [mute gestures] Hey! [mute gestures] Why are you lighting so many lamps? For whom are you doing this? Are you blackmailing God with devotion? Please stop it. My parents are right here. So, what? This temple, these lamps, my dress... Everything is matching. -Introduce me. -Hey! Please go that side without troubling. Please... Sister. What? That fellow is talking to some girl, sister. Seeing him they may ask about ticket counters and offerings but none would ask to get on the bike or come for a film. Hell with him, his face and his devotion! Come. You speak so much through messages and go high when met secretly. Why are you feeling so much shy and maintaining silence? Message. Hold on a minute. I forwarded you a message. Forward that to all your friends. [message beeps] See, it has come. Boss, I didn't expect that you are so old. I have the answer for this too. Check, I've sent it. So, the project Octopus is a missile project. -Hello, sir. -Hello. You are? I am Jai, son of Ramachandra Murthy. Oh, okay! I am here to clarify a small doubt that I have. How come the gold medallists have doubts? Octopus missile system, pride of Indian army! It's the most powerful missile launching system invented by DRDO. Octo. Octo means eight. For example, we have these eight pencils. When bombs are in these positions, they can travel anywhere in the range of 30 Kms. Light weight yet very powerful. One man can carry this any far. This has the power to destroy the whole city. It is a weapon when in the hands of our country. If it is in the hands of the enemy, it is a bane. -You understand, my boy? -Hmm. Even a trial process is taking place for Octopus in Delhi on the coming 26th. If they approve it, it will be in our military. Octopus! That means Octopus is being dispatched to Delhi for trial. 23rd midnight! This is the map from Hyderabad to New Delhi. 1550 Kilometers. It takes 24 hours with traffic if drove nonstop. It takes 48 hours when travelled by taking break. There would be high security at every place stopped. They halt either at the collector office or the local police headquarters. So there is no chance of theft. There are two weakest points in this. One is Nilagiri hills and the other is Vindhya hills Ghat roads. It will be 4 pm approximately by the time it reaches Vindhya hills, from the starting point. But the daytime attack is highly risky and no chance. Octopus reaches Nilagiri hills between 12 to 2. -Everybody take it. -Pass it. This is a Go-Pro camera, it should be on everyone's forehead. Because everything you see should appear to us, -on the screen here. -Okay, sir. All of you use your bluetooth. Look at there. They'd stop traffic on both sides once the vehicles enter the check post of the ghat. Park lorry in the given coordinates in the day time and keep it ready. [clanks] Brother, vehicles just moved. -We are ready. -Okay. [tyres screeching] [collision] [firing] [device siren] -Ask him to do fast. -Come on, open it. [clunks] Make it faster. What the hell is happening? Sir, the guy who blocked us now, is the same guy who was present at the time of the Yusuf's death. Bro! Iqbal. Not even one of our guys should be caught. Hey! [police siren] The cops are arriving. Let's go! He is caught, friend! He should not reveal anything about us at any cost. Shoot him. [firing] [groans] [police siren] Who is that fellow? It's Yogi. [gun shots] Shucks! Strangers attacked on the DRDO vehicles travelling from Hyderabad to Delhi. A number of people died but the container is safe. The DRDO Chief and ACP Murali Chandra are holding a press conference now. Let us now see in live. [camera captures] Yesterday after midnight, an attack took place on the DRDO vehicles going to Delhi at the Nallamala ghat road. Police have started the investigation. As a DRDO chief, I am announcing that there is no any damage happened in the attacks. My whole organization is appreciating Jai and his team. What was in that vehicle? What is the value of that container? Defence ministry will give a statement in this matter and that's all for now. What is this and who is that fellow? He ruined everything. I am facing failure for the first time in a deal. Who is that fellow? Who is with him? Who is behind him? I should know everything. Why is she here? Hmm! What is this? What are you doing here? Who is he, aunty? Oh, this guy? He is my second son and is a very shy guy. He doesn't talk much in front of the girls. Who is she, mom? She said she into water purifier marketing and with that excuse she started chatting with us. So, did you order? It seems they belong to our community. Okay, you talk to her and I will be right back. When I asked to show the water connection in your house, she said to wait till you come as she couldn't climb and show it to me. -Is it? Move out. -Dear. -Yes, mom. -Will you take her upstairs and show? Sure, mom. Come please! Get out first. Out... What is this? Stay quiet for a while. This feels good. My mom! She can't come upstairs. Kids! They haven't come yet. My dad! It is still not 4:30 pm. Bhargavi. Don't worry. Don't you feel shy? Not at all. No, Bhargavi. Shh! Keep quiet. I've got a surprise for you. Your uncle is our family friend. He had shared your picture on my dad's phone. My dad showed me. He made us get along even before we met. We will have his blessings from heaven all the time. "You caught tight and pulled my heart" "I love you, my beloved" "My darling... My darling..." "My darling... My darling..." "My darling... My darling..." "My darling... My darling..." "My darling... My darling..." "You threw the naughty look of yours and rob me in pace" "You made my heart get disturbed" "You have seen all my skills and withstood all my mischief" "You are teaching me all these confusions" "Hey Dragonfly! Enough of it" "You have done it all" "And you blame me when it's your mistake" "I waited long for you to kiss me" "I gave it directly as it is of no use waiting for you" "My darling... My darling..." "My darling... My darling..." "My darling... My darling..." "My darling... My darling..." "Are you the princess of Kosala Kingdom?" "Are you the colorful heap in loads?" "Are you the moonlight filled in the hands?" "Have you hiked the greed in huge?" "You caught tight and pulled my heart" "The moment I remember you even when in some work" "You arrived into my thoughts" "I drew a picture in the air for fun" "You became that in my heart" "This feeling is lovely" "Your breathe has pulled me" "I am seeing myself in you and hiding you in me" "You know what you have done to me, dear" "My darling... My darling..." "My darling... My darling..." "My darling... My darling..." "My darling... My darling..." "My shadow which followed me till yesterday" "It is now following you, what is this magic?" "My breath has become confused what's this magic?" "Hey girl, tell me what have you done? "You caught tight and pulled my heart" "I love you, my beloved" "My darling..." Friend, we got his details. We got his phone number, address, family details and everything. It's 10:10 am now. His total family should be killed by 10:40. I should meet him in between those dead bodies. Okay. [thundering] -Hello. -You did a big mistake. You have made a very big mistake. Indeed you killed me! Who is this? There is nothing you could give me to suffice the loss I incurred. Hey, who the hell are you? If you have to undergo the pain which I underwent, your most valuable possession... that is your family... Hey, what are you blabbering? What is the relation between you and me? Octopus! Your parents, siblings, sister-in-law, kids and all... are about to die in a while. Who you'd save with your capacity, it's up to you. I dare you! But, they will die! [music mutes voice] [phone rings] Hello, brother. Yes, Jai. Brother, listen to me. I am opening the shop. I will call you later. Hello... Hello... Damn! [thunder rumbles] [phone rings] [phone rings] Hey... Run as much as you can. Your final stop would be at your family members' dead bodies. One thing is for sure, all will die at the same time. You can reach only to one person. But all of them will go to the God. When you've obstructed us for the first time in the aspect of stamps, I have let you go as I thought that you've done that accidentally. But you have kept digging and reached till me. I am about to bury your family in the very same soil you have dug. Just within minutes, your family is going to be gone. [collision] [music mutes voice] I was the one who made that phone call, sir. You? Yes, sir. It was me. [phone rings] Hello Sir, a Bangladeshi terrorist family entered the city to plant bombs. What? Their whereabouts... [music mutes voice] They are my family members, not terrorists, sir. [police siren wails] [police siren wails] Sir, the police have arrived here. Hey friend, the police took away his family members before we could reach them. Damn it! Damn it! Damn it! Jai went to ACP's office. Connect me to ACP's office. [phone rings] Lucky fellow! I am an intelligent fellow! If not today, it'd be tomorrow or the day after or the day after that... But the death of your family members is certain. Not today or tomorrow, I am ready right from this moment. 24 hours and every day! You aren't aware of my pride! That's nothing! When I came to know that unacquainted 130 crores of Indians would be at loss, I've saved Octopus by putting life at putting my own life at risk. So you are already aware of my pride! You cannot stand before my power and army. Your entire family will be washed away! You might have come across many tough guys numerous times. But what they lack which my family has it is that... they have me. Forget about my family, you can't even touch the piece of whitewash of my house. No matter how and where you'd come from and how many men you'd get with you, I will stand as an obstacle on your way and as a soldier in front of my house. I dare you to come! We shall see about it! Damn! RSS'S MEMBER YELLAPRAGADA JAI AVERTS THE ROBBERY OF DRDO VEHICLES HIS FATHER RAMACHANDRA MURTHY IS THE RECIPIENT OF BEST TEACHER NATIONAL AWARD No matter how far you go and reach great heights in your life, I would straight away point out your mistakes when you commit them. Damn! They said it was some mock drill which happens regularly in shopping malls, mom. So, that had happened. They've informed me in advance. Just as a practice to know how to react if at all some information comes out. But, why have they taken only our family, son? They would not say all that to us, right dad? They will have their own calculations. They might probably have a positive opinion on our family. You do not worry. Everything is fine. I investigated the call that you have received. There was only a record of the call but couldn't trace the location. Moreover, there is no evidence of any attack. Did you get such call again? -No, sir. -Okay. -Thank you so much for your help, sir. -You are welcome. Go home. You have a surprise. Mom... Mom... Where are they? -[chanting to get rid of evil-eye] -What is this, mom? Come on, spit. Jai, I am sorry! You lost the chance to take half a litre of petrol from my bike from tomorrow. Here, the pocket money you had taken till date is accounted to 1,35,000 rupees. Clear that first. -What are you saying? -I need all that amount in PayTM app. What? This is an appointment letter for your job in DRDO. They've approved your pending job application in for saving Octopus. Bless me, dad! Congratulations. -Congrats buddy... You got it. -Thank you. -Congratulations, dear. -Thank you. Congrats, Jai Sister, he used to vent his frustration of not having a job on us all these days. We are safe now, aren't we, sister? He will now vent his frustration on us about the office. We cannot escape. You took money, time and challenged to get Octopus. What now? You said it would be a secret till the whole plan gets executed. Now, the entire knows about this. You have failed in it completely, Keshav. If you use the word 'failure' at me one more time, the voice in your throat will fail. You need Octopus and I need money. That is the only relationship between us How will you bring it? CBI has put up an enquiry commission on that. DRDO has tightened the security. We all would get caught if we step in. Octopus will be in your hands. You can silence me, but not the one who gave us the deal. If this plan doesn't get executed, you, he, I... and all will die. Ask all our guys to get into the underground. I am now going to Jai's house. Why to his house now? You are caring about matters of childhood memories. Emotions are useless here. Uhuh. I got to settle a few personal balances. The guy who blocked me from getting the Octopus, I will make him bring the Octopus to me. [music mutes voice] [tyres squeak] No matter how far you go and reach great heights in your life, I would straight away point out your mistakes when you commit them. I will do things as per my wish. I'll go so far where you can't reach me. Bujji Who? You are Bujji, right? Of course, I am Bujji. Who are you? Hey Bujji, it is me... Keshav. -Keshav? -I am Mr Raghava Rao's son. I am the one who used to live in the adjacent house of yours. Hey, Keshav! -[thunder rumbles] How are you? -I am good. It is been so long that I saw you. All these guys are my friends. -Hello... -Hi, Keshav. Hi... Hi... How come you are here and what is this sudden surprise? I saw you on the TV. So I came searching for you. Are you father and mother here? How are everyone doing? Everyone is doing great. Come, let's go to my home. It is nearby. -Hey, I'm taking him home. -Okay. Come on in. Dad... There is a surprise for all of you! See who has arrived. He is Keshav, son of Mr Raghava and Ms Sumitra. Keshava? How are you doing? Come, be seated. -How are your mother and father? -Everyone is doing great. My parents have settled in Bangalore. -Sit... -You too. Keshava, what are you doing? I am into import and export business. Dad, see! I have a degree and am doing business. He doesn't have any degree, yet, he is also into business. Come on, son. You grew so much. Unbeliveable! I am very happy for you. Pallavi, he is Keshava, my childhood friend. -Hello... -Hello. Have you come to Hyderabad on any work purpose? Yes, uncle. I saw him on TV and came to see everyone. -Oh! -I'm very happy for you. Where are you staying? At Hotel Taj Banjara. You came after so long and met us. You need not stay in the hotel. You can stay with us here. -Jai stays in the room upstairs. -Give it to me, mom. Stay there. No coffee today, please. Today, I am on fasting. What's with you? You've been giving series of shocks. Is it true? Brother... Alright. It is time for me to go to school. I will leave. -Good morning. -Hi, sir. -Welcome to DRDO, Jai. -Thank you, sir. -DRDO is proud to have you here. -Thank you, sir. [blips] What we have made for the nation and what you have saved for the nation... -Let us have a look. -Yes, sir. [blips] [whirrs] Octopus... It is the most lightweight and strongest missile launcher of the world. It is made with the material Graphene. This weapon has been invented using 14 scientific elements like nanotechnology. It works in any weather conditions. A human can carry this in a suitcase. It contains eight missiles. A human can go and destroy planned targets within 3 to 4 kilometres of the radius. The information about this weapon has already been leaked to the enemies. Their target is to steal this weapon from us and shoot it at our own cities. Their goal is to make the nation unstable, socially and economically. Sir, seeing this itself is a privilege. And it's my honour for making me involve in such a project. Protecting this is our duty. Sir, this job is my dream. This responsibility is equal to my life. I will not let you down, sir. Gift from my side. Apple watch! This ain't for knowing the time, but to remind you that our marriage time is nearing. Okay. Nice watch! When are you going to tell about us at your home? Well, do you think these gifts are necessary? Answer my question, rather than questioning about my gift. My dear hurricane love... When guys express their love to girls, they'd reply, "Is it?" Guys won't like it. They'd ask, "Why?" And we'd say we don't know. They'd ask how much we love them. We'd reply that we don't have its measure. Well, love is not something that has to be expressed. It should be shown in our actions. What's the matter? Why are you talking philosophy when you were asked about love? Are you going to ditch me by any chance or what? My cute darling, can anyone else bear with you, other than me? Can I get impressed by some other girl other than you? No, you are lying. -No, I am not lying. -You are lying. I am not lying, dear. You are lying to the person you like the most. Your heart beat is saying that. Yes, I am lying. [music mutes voice] Jai, I will not disturb you till your problem is solved. By sharing such a delicate issue with me, you said how close I am to you. I just want to say that I love you... more than anything. "Make time to redden my cheeks" "Become the time that shares dreams behind the eyelids" "Make time to redden my cheeks" "Become the time that shares dreams behind the eyelids" "Be a kiss on my neck, the moist in my hair," "a head on my lap and spend time with me" "I will keep waiting for you every second" "My love says to punish you in my embrace" "Wipeout your saree distance, give your waist into my hands" "and share the mist of your sweet lips" "Just break the barriers" "Wipeout your saree distance, give your waist into my hands" "and share the mist of your sweet lips" "Just break the barriers" "Make time to redden my cheeks" "Become the time that shares dreams behind the eyelids" "Under the bright orange sun between the strings of the Sarangi in the evening" "make your time to start the worship of romantic flowers" "Shall I join my hands with you along the beautiful lines of sandal?"

Try it out I will not try, but you will bring that to me. That'ss, I changed my target. My target now, is to get Octopus through you. Run as much as you want. Use as much brain as you want. You are giving me a job which I cannot do. Your family is so important to you as to how Octopus is important for me. Father, mother, brother, sister, kids... I'll keep you worried about your family members getting killed at any moment. This fight is between you who considers your family and the nation as your world, and me, who just cares about nothing but myself. The amount of pleasure I'd get by winning over you cannot even be compensated by winning over the nation. You are knocking the wrong door. No, I am knocking the right door. [doorbell dings] Hi dude. Hey Keshav Come on in. -Mom...-Yes. Keshav has arrived. [door creaks open] What is that dude? This is my dream. I've recently got a job in that organisation. Oh! Congratulations, dude. How is the house of your old friend, friend? It is giving foul smell of education, goodwill and patriotism. [laughs] Jai, the food is ready. Come down. Coming, mom. -Hey, let's go.-You move, I will come. You should finish those two sums by the time I come back. Mom, Keshav is coming too. Look now, he would switch to some News or Sports channel. [song playing on TV] It is confirmed, sister. He has smitten with a girl in his office. [phone ringing] -Hello. -Breaking news for you. Your sister is not home yet. Mom, where is Bindu? No idea, son. She hasn't come back yet. Why so late? Do you know what time it is? Flat tyre, brother. Fine. Come inside. [message notification tone] Oh crap! What happened, dude? Nothing. [message notification tone] What's with you? Can't sleep? You sleep, dude. [message notification tone] Guys, we have a situation. My family is in a problem. What happened? [music mutes voice] It is not right for my family members to know about this problem. And it is not easy for the Police to know. So, I have changed my phone number and will not use that sim card now. This is my new number. 770226101. I will be in touch with you on this number. What is the plan now, dude? We have no idea about when and who he'd target. So, we have to keep an eye on everyone. You follow my dad. You take care of my mom at home. You follow my brother. You follow my sister in law. Hey, you take care of kids. Where are you going, Bindu? To City Center shopping mall, brother. I too have work there. I too will come along. Okay. Bye, dude. It would take half an hour for me. Bindu, give the phone here. I will keep it with me. Okay. You'd anyway be in the treatment. Who is that guy? Who is the guy beside him? Who is behind all this? I have to them all. Need to find the answer. Sir, this is the Sim card used by Jai till yesterday. Girlfriend? Nice. Excuse me, sir. An accident took place on 21st October at Chadarghat main road. I am the main witness of that accident. May I know what happened to that case, sir? That case is closed. Do you have the address of the person who died? Yousuf Khadar Over there. Yousuf... -Is Yousuf your husband? -Yes. Who settled this case out of the court? They made the driver who crashed into him, pay one lakh rupees. -Who made the driver to pay you? -Wahab. Wahab? Do you know where he stays? There is a shop over there. You will get the information there. Sir, where can I get Wahab here? -What was the name? -Wahab Wahab, the driver of black Scorpio vehicle. He stays in the lane behind. Oh! Thank you. -Hey... -Kick him... That stamp guy is behind me. [dials] -Hello. -Jai is chasing Wahab, Keshav. Ask him to escape. I will tackle Jai. Hello. [music mutes voice] -Hey Irfan... -Yes. Don't spare him... Don't spare him... [phone rings] What's up, brother? Are you at home or office? Why is your sister wearing a pink dress today? Who is that clown beside her? Rascal! [groans in pain] Call Bindu [phone rings] What? Did you alert your sister? What did your sister say? Is she scared? Is she trying to hide? Call Keshav. [phone rings] Damn! Did any guy enter here? Ours is a small shop. No one came. [phone rings] Damn it! Hey, where the hell are you? At the shopping mall. Why are you not answering my calls? I kept the phone in silent mode. Where is Bindhu? Bindu's phone too is with me. I kept it in the pocket as it is not right to see a woman's phone. Alright. Be right there, I am coming. Wahab has come here. We don't need Wahab anymore. [children chattering] [car lock blips] Where is Mr Ramachandra Murthy? Tell me. You are Mr Ramachandra Murthy, aren't you? I got the news that you are preparing the question paper for 10th-grade exams. Get up... Get up... Who are you? Who are you? Where did you come from? Which private school have you come from? Hey, stop... Why are you running away? Stop... You! Hey... Stop... Take your suitcase. Stop... The anti-corruption team has arrested the government teacher Mr Ramachandra Murty in the evening when he was trying to sell the question paper. From the details gathered from Ramachandra Murthy, Police are investigating to know who else is involved in this scam. [phone ringing] Sir... I spoke to the lawyer. He will take care of everything. -Thank you, sir. -Okay. [whimpers] [phone rings] Sorry, brother. You thought I targeted your sister, haven't you? I broke my word. Did you expect that I'd kill each of your family member every day as per my threat? Yours is a middle class family. Honour is important than life. That's why, I have shamed your father. He cannot show his face to anyone. He cannot raise his head. His face is chopped Think over whether you want to break at least now. It is not about whether the person beside is dead or the guy behind has stopped or the guy ahead has collapsed, after the war begins. Winning the war is all that matters. Everytime you have called me to do things and I have out rightly rejected you, it means you are defeated. Hereafter, whenever you want to call me, get ready to hear 'no' from my side and then, call me. The Presidential award winner too is a traitor. He got arrested when caught in the act and released on bail. Yellapragada Ramachandra Murthy, who received the award from the President was caught red handed selling the 10th grade History question paper of CBSE. Parents are expressing grief about the future of the students, when their teachers who should be responsible are indulging in this acts. They are requesting the Government to punish the culprits severely so that such incidents do not repeat again. Wash your hands and feet. I will serve food. Daddy... Daddy... [knocks] -Daddy... open the door. -Jai, what happened? -Father in law... Father in law... -Daddy... Daddy... Daddy... -Daddy... -[gasping for breath] -Daddy... -Daddy... [weeps] What is this, daddy? I was already dead when I bent my head at the police station for the questions they've asked, son. Only this body is alive. I did not find any way other than to strangling my neck to shout and say to this world that I have not done any mistake. What is the world, daddy? You are our world. We are your world. We know that you have not done any mistake, daddy. Who else should know? Why do you still hide the fact? Tell them all this has happened because of you. You heard me right, uncle. All this has happened because of him. You wouldn't have been in this situation if you have given him what he wanted. I am unable to see your father in this state. We worried so much about the incident with Bindu. And now, it is him. What is all this? What can I say, dad? He is threatening to kill everyone in our family if I don't get him Octopus. Shall I tell you that? When I was asked to sell the nation for the sake of family, I told him that I couldn't do that. Shall I tell you that? He's been following every family member 24 by 7. And I've been fighting him without knowing who he is. Shall I tell you that? What do I tell you, dad? Tell me... What will you lose if something is lost from your office? What is important, family or office? Not just the most valuable Octopus in my office, even the bell pins that are very cheap are equal to the wealth of the nation. I will not give that. I cannot sell my nation for the sake of my family. When you were asked to give away some office stuff, Why do you link it with the nation? Well, what is there in this country? Uncle, you tell him at least. When compared to this family of brother, sister, sister-in-law and kids, what is there in this country? Poverty, debts, population, diseases, hunger, hunger, famine... They seek bribe for every work to be done. The Mother India that you pray looks good only in the photo frame. Actually, this nation itself is a big failure. It is better that every guy lives on his own here. Better. [scoffs] Yes, it is a failure! Not just my country... If you look around me, my family is a big failure. My dad wanted to become an IAS or IPS officer, but he remained as a teacher. He is a failure. My mom remained as the wife of a school teacher due to financial condition. She is a failure My brother couldn't get a proper job as per his education. He is doing business by investing father's money. He is a failure. My sister-in-law came here with lots of hopes but got stuck in a joint family. She is a failure. I applied for a job in DRDO and failed in its interview. I too am a failure. But if we change our thought process and analyze... My dad is a teacher who has shaped hundreds of IAS and IPS officers. He is a success. My sister-in-law is running a big joint family. She is a success. My brother wants to be top businessman regardless of whether he likes his work or not. He is a success. My mom gave birth to DRDO scientist and raised him. She is a success. Similarly, this nation, despite being under the reign of foreign rulers for thousands of years, though struggled and suppressed... This is the nation that endured with head held high. Success and failure lies within us. 100 crores of population is not a weakness. It is the strength. A confluence of some people makes a family. And the confluence of lakhs of families makes a country. Even if one family gets destroyed, it doesn't bring great loss to the nation. But if something happens to the nation, not a single family would survive. I am saying this under the witness of my family, I will not give Octopus to him. [phone rings] Hello... Hello, Jai. Can you hear my words? Where are you? What was that news on TV last night? When I tell you that I want to come to your house, you'd say no. Where are you? Jai... Hello... Hello... Got disconnected again. Let us meet. [message notification tone] Okay Where? Same place. Where are you now? Kavanah coffee shop Switch off your mobile. [music mutes voice] Getting delayed for my French class. -Ok girls, bye. -Bye... Bye. Take care. -Bye -Bye -Auto, take me to Gachibowli. -Okay, madam. -Follow that auto. -Okay, sir. Bye, mom. Sir, courier. My old phone number bill? Why are all the messages going to Bhargavi? What's happening? Jai... Jai... What happened, Jai? -Where is Bhargavi? -She has just left for French class. French class? I'll tell at home that I would be going to French class as an excuse to come here. Why did you come here? It was you who asked me to come here, right? -I didn't ask you to come. -What is happening, Jai? I do not understand anything. What happened? You do not worry. He is the first person to know about you in my life. His exit from my life would pave the way to your entry. Shall we fix the Muhurta? "The girl is stunning. And the mind is blown..." "A riot took place in the litte heart" "The girl is stunning. And the mind is blown..." "A riot took place in the litte heart" "The Goddess spoke out and excitement followed" "There's been a lot of happiness in both the eyes" "Our wedding is set. And there is no stopping us" "Let us rock every lane with the wedding music" "Hey elegant damsel..." "Come to me with your charming moves" "Hey elegant damsel..." "You have to give me a sweet kiss" "The girl is stunning. And the mind is blown..." "A riot took place in the litte heart" "The Goddess spoke out and excitement followed" "There's been a lot of happiness in both the eyes" "Hello boy! I say that not even gun powder can match your stare" "Your waist fold is like a colony of ants" "What can I do if it surrounds me, Oh girl?" "My saree becomes a fan" "Ooo..." "So start reaping happiness" "Ooo..." "Your dangling earrings bring the percussions inside me" "What can I do when it is pulling me towards you?" "Hey elegant damsel..." "Come to me with your charming moves" "Hey elegant damsel..." "You have to give me a sweet kiss" "The girl is stunning. And the mind is blown..." "A riot took place in the litte heart" "The Goddess spoke out and excitement followed" "There's been a lot of happiness in both the eyes" I shared my new phone number only with my seven friends and not even you. And still, I am getting calls from him. Does that mean, your friends are involved in this conspiracy? Huh, maybe! He may have taken the number from one of my friends. He might have bought one of my friends. Or he might be one of my friends. He played the game till now. From now on, I will take it from here. We are going to Annavaram. Dad has a vow to fulfil in that temple. Even mom would relax a little. I've setup a trap in my room. Technically, it is a system to identify the caller regardless of the distance from where the caller is calling. This is my winning shot in the game taking place in between him and me. One more phone call... he is gone. Alright. We shall meet later. Hey Keshav, it is better that you shift to the hotel room. I don't want you to get into further trouble because of me. Sorry! Let us go, boys. [horn blares] Driver, turn the vehicle. Take back to the house. Switch off the lights. Mom, he would get doubt if all of us go inside together. Go one by one. [door creaks] The watchman comes exactly at 10 pm and leave by 5 am. The milkman comes at 5.30 am. The paperboy comes at 6 am. It means nobody wanders in this street between 5 am and 5.30 am. If there is someone who wants to come to my house, he'd come only after 5 am. Let us wait for 5 o' clock. [gate creaks] [door creaks open] Hey... [glass shatters] Oh! Hey... Keshav... He is in the house. He is chasing me. There is an under-construction building at the eighth lane of Madhuranagar. -Come there, I will cover you there. -Okay. [groans] Who the hell are you? Who the hell are you? Who... Who gave you my number? Tell me. Is it this guy? This guy? This guy? This guy? Tell me. Don't tell him. Is it this guy? No. Tell me. Who is it? Is it this guy? Huh! Speak up! [pierces] Damn! Is my photo among those six photos? Didn't he show my photo despite my photo being in that? Or didn't he say because my photo wasn't really there in that? Or didn't he say despite recognising me? [message notification tone] Dear friends, all of you come to Taramati for lunch. How was your Annavaram trip? Spectacular. Where is the offering? Mom will give at home. By the way, I have to announce important news for all of you. Consider that the phone guy is almost caught. All that I have to do now is just hand him to over to ACP. One minute... Sir... Sir... Tell me, sir. Okay, sir. What's the phone number? Hey, give your phone once. Just a second, sir. Tell me, sir. I did not expect that you'd get caught so easily. This is the number of your friend Iqbal. I didn't expect you to get caught like this. I am your friend! [scoffs] You've considered me as your friend, but I didn't consider it likewise. I have faith over your calculations. I know that you will catch me. I came here not to get caught by you. I am here to tell you that it was you who got caught. Just check the videos on your phone. [bomb timer blipping] [bomb timer blipping] Since that's a phone camera, there is no clarity. Hey... Your dad's head would explode if you lay your hands on me. Your family member who you've been saving all these days are with me now. Whatever intelligent efforts you have used in nabbing me, use the very same thing and get that most valuable item of this nation that is Octopus, to me. -Do you want to talk to them? -[gasps] They are saying that they'd kill us, uncle. Love you, uncle. Jai, you take care. Where are the kids? [bomb timer blipping] Jai, where is your mother? Where is everyone? I hope nothing bad had happened to you, right? What, son? Dad... Dad... Hey Jai, what is there to think in this matter? Tell them that Octopus is the pride of this nation. Damn! I know about you and your family. That's why I didn't hesitate to do this. I have attached 14 kgs of RDX for each one of them. I've placed in the most populated areas of the city planning to detonate between 4 pm and 5 pm. If Octopus is not with me within half an hour, they'd get blown up with the blast radius of wiping out an entire area around them. Decide whether you'd alone do this mistake by bringing Octopus to me or watch your family members blown up along with hundreds of people in the city. You, who found out about me, find my location and reach me. Good luck, my dear friend! Hey... So many troubles just for holding on to a single stance? Don't be on it. Don't. My family members told me to take care of myself and asked about the kids, but none of them asked to come and save them despite knowing that they are going to die Even the kids said the same. That is the respect they've given to my decision. How can I face them in the future after losing this for the sake of saving them? All I can give to my family is winning over this situation. Winning? Do you understand that he has held your parents as hostages? Do you think he wouldn't kill them after all this? We will die! All of us will die! We are getting into a war. People would talk about us if we die. But if we win, hundreds of people like us would be born. Let's go, guys. Sir, what all places would be crowded at this point of time? First place is Kukatpally. Kukatpally... Rajesh, draw a circle with 3 km radius taking Kukatpally as the centre. Kukatpally. Gachibowli. Secunderabad. Old City. Mehdipatnam. All my family members are in the areas of these circles, sir. The common point is that he is connected with my family members over a phone, sir. He can trigger the bombs with just one SMS. In order to be unaffected by the bomb blasts, he should either be in the city outskirts or in the centre of the city. As it is not safe to take Octopus to the outskirts of the city, as per my estimation, he'd safely wait for me from the centre of the city, sir. Rajesh, take a center point from these circles. Form another circle in the middle with that centre point. So, he would be somewhere around this point to remain unaffected, sir. The city would be wiped out with a single SMS if we go there with the police force. [explosion] My God! The entire city would be destroyed if he executes his plan. That should not happen. An SMS should be sent in order to detonate those bombs. To prevent SMS, all mobile networks in those areas should be down, sir. We need high-level permission to shut down those mobile networks. We have to explain this to the service providers. For all this to be done, it takes a minimum of three hours. Why'd it take three hours to pull plugs in the offices, sir? Sir, I have an idea. Rajesh, how many service providers do we have? Airtel, BSNL, Jio, Idea... There would be around ten service providers. Okay. Good. Contact all those employees including those from the basic positions till topmost positions, who are part of Jawaan group. You can find their numbers in our 'Jawaan' WhatsApp group. All the network signals in those circles should be down with immediate effect. All the internet providers should get jammed.
