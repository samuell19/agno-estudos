[Suspenseful music] [small dog barking] [woman] Artie! [Barking continues] Artie, are you kidding me? Now listen. I'm serious. There is no way in hell I'm going back to do a romantic comedy. I don't care! Just find me something... meaningful, something... oh, sh‐‐ Esmeralda? I gotta go. Bitsy's running around outside. Of course, I don't know where the maid is. I gotta go get him before the coyotes do. So, listen, I love you. Find me something good... Else you're fired. Ha‐ha‐ha. Okay. Thanks, bye. Bitsy? Bitsy? Bitsy! Bitsy? [Crows] Bitsy! Bitsy! What are you doing here, you naughty, naughty doggie! You cannot do that. You scare Mama like that. Okay, you can't run off like that. That is a very naughty girl. You'll be eaten by very big, bad coyotes. Time for us to take a little shower, lady! [Water running] [whines] [teapot whistling] Esmeralda? Esmeralda! Esmeralda? Ow! Ah! Gosh! Esmeralda! [Sighs] [phone ringing] Esmeralda! [Phone continues ringing] [ringing] Uggh! [Busy signal] [cocks gun] Oh, my God! Aah! [Gasping] ‐ [whirrs] ‐ [electricity buzzes] Thank you. Miss Anderson. Miss Anderson. Miss Anderson, thank you. Thank you. You have no idea what this means to my family. Mr. Hernandez, again, I'm so sorry for your loss, but maybe now you can finally start to move on. I think so. Now that we know that he'll never be able to get out of prison, we'll be able to... find some peace and, uh... and celebrate the life of my daughter. Oh. You take care of yourself, Mr. Hernandez. You too. I'd say "nicely done," but I don't want to inflate your ego. Ha ha! A compliment from you? I wouldn't know what to do with it. I will say that was a tough one. Second degree and nothing but circumstantial? I honestly didn't think you could do it. Now I've changed my mind about that compliment. Heh. I hate to cut the victory dance short, but I need you to focus on the next case. ‐Already? ‐Well, this isn't just any case, Shelby. This is a game‐changer for us, and I want you sitting beside me at trial. Am I missing something here? I take it you haven't read this morning's headline. No. Karen Donovan was murdered last night. Yeah. Daedalus has returned. [Man] Daedalus. How many years has it been since the last one? Two years, eleven months, nine days. Every couple of years or so I think, "This has gotta be the last one. He's gotta be dead by now." But then there's always another one. Yep, and this time our boy's making a statement. A former governor's wife. This one's gonna be high‐profile. You recognize his M. O? Yeah, his M. O. Is he's sharp, he's calculated. See, he didn't just want Karen Donovan dead. He wanted to toy with her. I wonder who this guy is. How did he have time to prep the rail with Mrs. Donovan still in the house? I don't know, he had to bait her outside somehow. What about the gun? The gun, the bullets were replaced with inert rounds. Yeah. I figured that. The black box? What's the deal with the box? It was custom made with a trigger mechanism. We've broken it down. The components are too common to trace the sale, though. That's cause he knows how we work. How'd he do it? How did he do it? He didn't put it up on the railing, and it's too far to the ground. Hey, uh, give me your glove. Yeah, got a pair? Thanks. Bingo. Are you sure you're ready for a case like this? Obviously, Lisa thinks I am, or she wouldn't want me on it. What, Dad? Say what you want to say. I'd hate to think Lisa has more faith in my abilities than you do. No, it isn't that, sweetheart, but a case like this could break your career, and a broken career is hard to fix. Right, Dad. Yeah, of course. You're sure it's not the husband? Sometimes the obvious assumption is the right one. No, it has to be Daedalus. The whole crime scene matches his process. Ohh. Are you sure you're okay? Yeah. I'm just concerned that Daedalus is setting another trap. He frames people, that's what he does, and nobody knows that better than I do. Dad, you followed the letter of the law. All the evidence pointed to Ogden and the others. Yeah, I sent those men to prison, innocent men, and I've had to live with that my whole life. Any other judge would've done the same thing. Juries can make mistakes; judges can't. Okay, tell you what. Lisa and I are meeting with one of the detectives today. If I don't think it's iron‐clad, I'll pull myself from the case. That I can live with. [Woman] We'll be working from here, and you'll be coordinating with Detective Mike Holland, here, Shelby. ‐Mike, this is Shelby Anderson. ‐Hi. ‐Nice to meet you. ‐Hello. Well, you look nothing like your dad. ‐You know my dad? ‐Well, of him. I mean, it's kind of hard not to when you've spent the past 20 years chasing Daedalus. Twenty years? What, did you make the force at 15? Actually, his 11th‐grade history teacher was James Ogden. Falsely accused Daedalus number three. Someone's been doing their homework. Yes. He was a terrific guy. He did not deserve to spend three years of his life in prison and lose his family. [Woman] This time we're gonna prosecute the real deal. I don't have any interest in breaking any records for the most false convictions of a single killer, do you? ‐Not at all. ‐Good. Did we find out what he took this time? Yes, we had the cleaning staff do a thorough inventory. ‐We think this is it. ‐Hmm. Daedalus stole a teddy bear? He always takes a souvenir, something inexpensive but unique. I'd never heard that before. Well, actually, no one has, because we haven't told anyone. We figured it out after the third killing. The victim's son told us that a puzzle box was missing, and ever since then we have been doing inventory. ‐Smart. ‐Now, the first Daedalus killing was in 1963. That makes this guy at least in his 60s. Now, given his talent for framing other people for the crimes he's committed, I am certain that this guy was in law enforcement. He's killed 33 people, all married women who've been having an affair. Was Karen Donovan having an affair? Yeah, we're still checking on that. Boot print was a lucky break. Not as lucky as this one. The blood on the nails. Now, the DNA matches the victim's, Karen Donovan, but there's a second set of DNA that we couldn't match to anything in the house. Why would Daedalus leave his own blood at a crime scene? Even if he did cut himself, he'd know we'd test the nails. Because he's starting to make mistakes. No, that doesn't make any sense. Why now? Because the guy is in his 60s, like I said. Maybe he's not as sharp as he used to be. Or maybe it's a trap, and he's a lot sharper than the cops. Everyone makes mistakes sooner or later. ‐Not Daedalus. ‐Yes. Yes, Daedalus! Look, Shelby, Daedalus is just a man. I don't care how many times this has happened before, it's not gonna happen again. And why's that? Well, 'cause this time I'm on the case. The infamous serial killer Daedalus has struck again, this time murdering film star Karen Donovan. Daedalus, named after the Greek architect who was known to construct the labyrinth of Crete, channels his victims through a maze into a lethal trap. ‐What do you have? ‐Past Daedalus cases. Start with Linda Carmichael, August 15th, 1963. She was the first Daedalus killing. The second one is June MacNair. This is the Chicago factory murder. This was July 2nd, 1971. Now, a lot of people don't think this was a Daedalus killing. I do. The M. O. Was way too close. October 31st, 1971, Gladys Morlow. He painted the labyrinth right over her body. There was 11 more dead girls by the end of the decade. We've got Kelly Yamanoko. We've also got Roxanne Wyland. These were two of his most high‐profile murders. They were both daughters of high‐powered public officials. God, they were so young. 1980s, we have seven that we know of. Nineties, there were only five, and so on, until we get to Miss Anne Castillo, which was the one right before Karen Donovan. She was a nursing student on her way home from night classes at Cal State Tujunga. Well, to see them all right here in front of you... This is big, Shelby. It's daunting. I was hoping your dad could give us some perspective. ‐What are those? ‐Oh. Here... we've got our false Daedaluses. Number one is Bill Garrison. He was arrested in September of '79. He was found wandering around by Daedalus killing number 15. Then we got Reggie Carvano. He was arrested in February of '88. Reggie's fingerprints were found on a seashell that was also at one of the Daedalus crime scenes. And that brings us to false Daedalus number three. James Ogden. That's what he looked like 20 years ago when I knew him. He was the kind of guy that you would, uh, you would introduce to your sister. Wow, what happened to James Ogden really affected you. [Sighs] All right. I'll call my dad. [Mike] So, what does a retired judge do? What does a retired judge do? Well, I always tell Shelby that the most fun part about getting older is finding young people to mentor. But mostly I collect overpriced wines, and I read current cases, and I grumble. ‐ [Chuckles] ‐ And I've got a cabin up in Big Bear. No, Tahoe, Dad. Big Bear was before Mom died. You sold it and bought the one in Tahoe. That's right. ‐Spectacular view. ‐That sounds beautiful. We don't get up there much anymore. Shelby's mom died in a car accident. Icy roads. There were too many hard memories. I'm very sorry. I don't have much time for cabins or vacations, anyway. I warned Shelby that the DA's office would eat up her personal life, which is why she's still single. ‐ [Laughs] ‐Settle down. ‐Well, I'm just lucky she's on our side. ‐Mike, defenders and prosecutors should both be on the only side that matters: the truth. Yes, sir. It's been hard on Shelby. It's like being the preacher's daughter. But I couldn't be prouder of her. It's always a blessing when your child exceeds your greatest expectations. Well, you've got every right to be proud of her. Yep. You have a beautiful home. Would you like a tour? No, thanks, I've already seen it. ‐Dad... ‐ [laughs] Yes. I would love a tour, thank you. You know, I gotta tell you, I was, uh... I was a little nervous meeting you. Why is that? Well, I testified once in your court, and you scared the hell out of me. Hmm... I was just testing you. Did I pass? Test ain't over yet. Here... is all that overpriced wine ‐Dad was talking about. ‐Fantastic! This was a great place for hide‐and‐seek when I was younger. Ah. People actually have these, huh? ‐Yeah. ‐Hmm. I'm more of a beer cellar kind of guy myself. Mm. Margarita cellar for me. Not bad. When I was younger, my friends and I used to take them down and play a feminist version of Guinevere versus Maid Marian ‐versus Joan of Arc... ‐ [laughs] Oh, my dad would get furious. Oh, I bet. Ta‐da! [Whistles] Don't judge me. Ho‐ho! Wow. Brit boys. Mm. They were a big deal. Eh, when I was 15. I know I'm a fan. That's a great picture of your dad and you. Thanks. Wow, that's a... That's an awful big trunk you got there. Is that where you stash all the bodies? ‐Funny. No, actually, want to see something cool? ‐Yeah. Look, it has this little secret compartment down here. My favorite. ‐That's cute. ‐Thanks. What, your, uh, dad give that to you? Yeah. Well, he gave me everything. I think he overcompensated when my mother died. He didn't want me losing a girl's perspective. Your father's a good man. Yeah, he is. Thanks for coming, Mike. It was a pleasure. Oh, pleasure's all mine. Thank you very much. Hey, you mind if I use your restroom before I‐‐? Down the hall. The open door. Open door. Thank you. ‐Morning. ‐Ready for our morning walk? How about I tempt you with a blueberry waffle instead? Like Mom used to make. Mike seems like a nice guy. Yeah. Yeah, he's pretty focused. ‐And you're not? ‐Heh. You look so much like your mother. You know, she and I, we could talk about things that most people never even cared about, like philosophy of language, logic, law... Being together made both of us better at what we did. You see, sometimes if you're lucky, you meet somebody who inspires you. [Pounding on door] ‐Who the hell could that be? ‐I'll get it. ‐Mike! ‐Shelby. Wait, what's going on? I'm sorry, is your father home? ‐What's happening? ‐Judge Anderson. I have two warrants here‐‐ ‐What's going on? ‐One to search your house, and the other for your arrest in the murder of Karen Donovan. ‐Murder? What are you talking about? ‐Please handcuff‐‐ You can't do this! You can't come into my house and arrest me! ‐ [Reciting Miranda warning] ‐Shelby! You are so far over your head you have no idea! I'm gonna get you thrown off the force! Who the hell do you think you are? Dad, stop talking, please! ‐Shelby! ‐Mike, you are making a big mistake! His DNA matches the blood found ‐in the carpet nail, Shelby. ‐No. A traffic camera took a photo of your father's car leaving the vicinity of Karen Donovan's murder ‐an hour after it happened. ‐No, that's not possible. I'm sorry. Sometimes people surprise you, Shelby. They sure do. Do not say a word, not a word. I will be there. I will get you out, I promise, as quickly as I possibly can. ‐ [Siren squawks] ‐Not a word! [Sobs] [door buzzes] ‐Hi. ‐Hi. I'm gonna get you out of here, Dad. Death is nothing. But my reputation... Yeah. [Sighs] How did your DNA end up in Karen Donovan's house? Do you even know her? Were you there for some kind of an event? Well, yeah, I met the governor a couple of times. Do you remember the last time you saw him? No. No, I don't recall. How did they match your DNA? You have to be convicted of a crime to end up in the national DNA database. When I was on the bench, I pushed for DNA background checks, and I wanted to set an example, so I volunteered. Okay, that's good. Anyone would understand that a man who advocates justice would never commit murder. Dad, that traffic photo. What were you doing there at 1:00 in the morning? Sometimes I like to go out. But there‐‐ there's something... Give me a minute. Um... What? What is it? You don't remember. Hmm‐mm. Oh, my God, you really don't remember. Dad, are you okay? The doctors told me that I have early Alzheimer's. I was doing okay, I was fine, until they took my meds away. How long have you known? A few months. Why didn't you tell me? I didn't want to worry you. Lisa, this is absurd. You've known my father for years. And I'm gonna make sure he gets a fair trial, but it's the former governor's wife, Shelby! My father is not capable of murder. You and I both know there is something more to this. I thought we were after justice. I am, but you're not being objective, Shelby. Look, I've spoken to Dan Artuno in San Francisco. He'd be happy to have you in his office for the duration. We'll even pay for the lodging. I'm going to defend my father. That's ridiculous. I won't allow it. Lisa, if you prosecute my dad, you leave me no choice. Shelby, you've worked far too hard to throw everything away like this‐‐ your career, your reputation. I will not fail. [Lisa] Your Honor, Mr. Anderson is a risk. He can flee the country. He can kill again. Not to put too fine a point on it, but the defendant is innocent until proven guilty. Galen Anderson is a respected judge with an illustrious career, not to mention the fact that there is a history of false accusations when dealing with Daedalus cases, Your Honor. There is overwhelming evidence that links him to the crime scene at the former governor's house! But he has not been convicted, Ms. Couphon. I understand that, Your Yonor, but‐‐ But he is also a highly revered judge. We can't put him behind bars with the same criminals he spent a lifetime putting in jail. ‐It would put him at great risk! ‐ [Scoffs] I'm setting his bail at $150,000, and the defendant will be released under restricted house arrest, wearing an ankle monitor. [Chatter] Do you believe your father's really innocent? Do you think you'll win this case? What do you have to say about these charges? Miss Anderson, how does it feel to be on the other side? ‐No comment. ‐What was Daedalus like at home? Okay, thank you. Thank you. "No comment" means no comment. Does this change your relationship with your father? Sorry. They can't get through this door. ‐It needs a key. You can just go right out the back. ‐What are you doing? Just want to make sure you're okay. After what you did to my father? Shelby, you're a prosecutor. I mean, come on. How many times have you heard people swear up and down that their loved ones were innocent? The only difference is now you're on the other side. Don't go there. You have no right. I'm sorry that you're in the position you're in, but I'm not gonna apologize for doing my job. ‐Then why are you here? ‐To warn you. Look, you need to be careful. That man, he's using you. Oh, my God. Mike, listen to yourself. No. No, no. This is what Daedalus does. Don't you understand? This man has got schemes within schemes. He's using you right now. You are in the middle of the labyrinth, and you have no idea. Then tell me, Mike, if all that's true, why haven't you asked yourself what role in Daedalus's plan you play, or do you think that you're the one person who's outsmarted him? It's gonna be okay, Dad. You know, when I sat on the bench, I had all this time to watch the defendants. Some looked like they didn't care. Most looked serious but concerned, like they were trying to imagine how an innocent person looked. But a few... had this wide‐eyed look like they had no idea what was going on around them. They just were confused and frightened. Ah... The confused and frightened ones usually lost. It's the DNA evidence. That's going to be trouble. Dad, do you have any idea how your blood might've gotten there? I presided over three of the trials. I made a lot of enemies. Maybe one of them is seeking retribution, or, perhaps, the real Daedalus is looking for a payback because none of the previous frames would stick. But how would he have gotten your blood? I don't know. I don't know. I sleep with the windows open at night. Maybe my doctor's office. I don't know! Okay. We need help. I know a guy. Freddy Cook, private investigator. Do you remember him? No. Well, this isn't his specialty, but he owes me. [Phone ringing] Freddy! This is Shelby Anderson. [Judge] So, more paperwork, Counselor. Your Honor, uh, this is a preliminary list of witnesses we intend to call. Detective Matthew Brady, Chicago Police Department? I don't see how this witness has anything to do with the case, Your Honor. He was lead detective on the July 2nd 1971 murder of June MacNair. My client is not on trial for something that happened 40 years ago. That's a fair question, Counselor. I understand. I wanted to save the court the burden of so much additional material, but since it's vital... ‐Could we just get on with it, please! ‐For getting at the truth! I am petitioning to officially add the murders of June MacNair, Kelly Yamanoko, Roxanne Wyland, and Gladys Morlow ‐to the list of charges. ‐Objection, Your Honor. This is no way to conduct yourself in my courtroom. Your Honor, we intend to prove that Galen Anderson is the real Daedalus killer, always has been. These new materials overwhelmingly link the defendant to all those crimes. Your Honor, this is all circumstantial. No. Once I review the materials presented by the state, I'll decide if they admit their burden to support their additional charges. Court will be adjourned till 10:00 a.m. tomorrow morning, ‐when I will have made my decision. ‐ [Bangs gavel] You are reaching on this. Oh, it's only four additional counts. You're lucky it's not all 33. [Man] You know, the noodles next door, pretty dodgy, but I always get the extra MSG. I see your diet hasn't changed. Actually, the original Chinese word for "MSG" was "the essence of flavor." Their point. So, how's the old man holding up? He's doing the best he can under the circumstances. ‐So, what can I do for you? ‐We need your help. My father was set up. Not what they're saying on CNN. Come on, Freddy. You of all people should know that he's innocent. He set you straight. You owe him. Okay. Okay. What's your theory? I think that the real Daedalus is behind this, and he's framing my father. What, Daedalus framing your father? Well, I just think it seems like a stretch. I mean, how would he get access to your dad's DNA? That's the million‐dollar question. I think that the real Daedalus is a cop, or some sort of government official. No one else would have access. ‐There's no other explanation. ‐So what do you want me to do? Start by figuring out his M. O. Here. These... are the three false Daedaluses: Bill Garrison, Reggie Carvano, and James Ogden. These are old photos, so they probably look different now. Find out how they were framed. Talk to any friends or family they may have. [Reporter] It's a media frenzy here today on day three of the Galen Anderson trial. With both sides finishing up opening arguments yesterday, there's been plenty of heated moments and drama so far. The prosecution plans to prove that Galen Anderson is indeed the infamous serial killer Daedalus, while the defense contends the former judge is simply a pawn in a labyrinth of conspiracy. [Lisa] Dr. Zhang, in your expert opinion, would you tell us your profile of the Daedalus killer? ‐Objection. ‐The state is establishing motive, Your Honor. Every serial killer has one, and it is vital to illustrate that pattern in order to connect it to the victim. You may answer the question, but restrict yourself to motive. [Zhang] Yes, Your Honor. It's well known that Daedalus victims are all women who are engaged in extramarital affairs. From a profiling standpoint, that's important because it points to a patriarchal man who sees himself as an emotional vigilante. For him, the victims are villains who have gotten away with a crime because the court system does not know how to punish them. Mrs. Hardington, you were close friends with Karen Donovan. We're looking into her background. You're not blaming the victim, are you? Not at all. It's just, do you know anything about Karen's past that could complicate things? Not that I can think of. I don't like surprises, especially when they can blow my case. All right. I saw Karen up at Coral Shoals up along the coast a couple weeks before she died. I don't know what Coral Shoals is. What is it? Vacation condo rentals. Very discreet. It's a place you go for a little something something on the side. Anyway, Karen was there, and she was incognito‐‐ sunglasses, scarf over her head, that sort of thing. So she was having an affair? The governor was very uptight and traveled all the time. [Shelby Isn't it true that Daedalus has framed at least three people previously? ‐ [Zhang] Yes. ‐Why? Well, he clearly takes enjoyment in being able to outwit the legal system. So, based on your proposed profile, wouldn't it be very exciting to Daedalus to frame a judge, a pillar of the legal system? ‐Objection. ‐Overruled. Dr. Zhang, please answer the question. Perhaps. Isn't it true the defendant was the presiding judge in the three previous Daedalus trials? [Zhang] Yes. For Daedalus, the irony of that might be especially exciting. Thank you. No more questions, Your Honor. Welcome back, everybody, as we continue today's conversation. I'm Stefan Chase, joined by legal expert Charles Lott. Charles, turning to the prosecution's strategy, many in the legal community were surprised when the state chose to try the defendant for prior Daedalus murders and not just the killing of Karen Donovan. How is that possible? [Lott] Well, it's very common for serial killers to cover great distances crossing state lines, so a new law was created allowing for the consolidation of charges in a single prosecution. This eliminates the need to extradite suspects ‐to other states for trials. ‐Okay, very interesting. While the state has enough evidence to prosecute, it's unlikely they'll get convictions on the previous murders. So, then why take this to court? It's actually a brilliant move by the state. Getting those additional murder charges allows them to use some witness testimony the defendant gave during the previous investigation years ago, and through that affidavit, the state will try to establish a pattern of behavior that will serve as motive. Okay, we definitely understand now. [Clicks off] Damn paparazzi. [Galen] Shelby! Hey! Hey! [Screams] ‐Shelby! ‐ [Man screams] Aah! Oh! [Galen] Shelby! Shelby! Shelby, what are you doing? ‐I'm fine, Dad, I'm fine. ‐ [Beeping] Your monitor. Come on. We gotta get back to the house. ‐Come on. ‐You shouldn't be chasing paparazzi. [Man] The Chicago factory murders, June 2nd, 1971. We found this girl, June MacNair, dead in an abandoned factory on the near West Side of Chicago. I was a rookie cop back then. It was my first murder scene, and it was a unique murder scene because there was this heart painted on the window above her dead body. What links the defendant to Chicago? The defendant studied law at Northern Chicago University Law School, where he earned his degree. [Lisa] What other evidence do you have that links the defendant to the MacNair murder? The defendant was in the same law fraternity as June MacNair's husband, Robert. How do you know that? Based on many interviews I had with witnesses, plus the fact that a scarf from the same fraternity was found in the defendant's belongings. Your Honor, I would like to show the witness the defendant's scarf that has been marked as prosecution's exhibit 49. [Judge] You may proceed. ‐Is that the scarf you were referring to? ‐Yes. And was the husband questioned at all in his wife's murder? Of course. He was initially considered a main suspect. [Lisa] Why? They were going through a messy divorce. Do you know why they were getting a divorce? Well, at the time, we thought they were no longer compatible. You hesitated. Did that information change? [Man] Well, a few years later, I ran into the husband at a ball game. We ended up having a few beers together, and he told me confidentially that Mrs. MacNair had been stepping out on him. Objection. Hearsay. Sustained. The jury will disregard Detective Brady's last statement. Was the husband cleared? Yes. He had an iron‐clad alibi. And was the defendant questioned at all about this Chicago murder? [Brady] Yes, but at the time all the questions were geared towards his fellow frat member, the husband, Robert. You remember the defendant after all these years? Absolutely. [Lisa] He must've left quite an impression on you. ‐Objection. ‐Withdrawn. Please rephrase. What makes you think after all these years that the defendant is involved in the Chicago murder? The defendant was spotted near the crime scene, but at the time, we couldn't establish motive. Once I became aware of the fact that she had had an affair, a statement the defendant had made many years ago during the interview process, well, frankly, that statement came back to haunt me. What did he say? He said that... broken hearts are the worst crime. And that... their perpetrators never get the just punishment they so sorely deserve. That sent a chill through me. And the look in his eyes, well... it was looking into the eyes of an empty soul. [Knocks] Hello. [Shelby] Lisa is now trying to connect you to past Daedalus killings. If we can establish alibis for them, then we'll be able to plant doubt in the jury. Shelby, my memory is getting hazier and hazier. You have to try, Dad. Maybe look at your notes or receipts, past case histories. Even if I could remember, I'd still have to prove them. [Pounding on door] Well, that's what we have Freddy for. What are you doing here? Did you find something out about our stalker? Well, the department is treating it as an incident with a deranged freelance photographer. No. No. It wasn't paparazzi. No, I‐I know, but that's the department's official line on the whole thing. So you have no useful news. Well, you're not welcome. Actually, no, it's not the reason why I came. Look. I found something, and I wanted to show you before I brought it to Lisa and the judge. It's a pill bottle with your dad's name on it. I found it at Karen Donovan's beach house. You're nothing but an opportunist looking to make a name for yourself, and I will not let you do this to Karen! Dad, speaking as your attorney, shut the hell up! Why are you helping us? Believe it or not, I'm looking for justice, just like you. Get off my property. Now! Get off of my property! ‐Dad. ‐Get out! I'll take the fifth. I'm perfectly willing to take the fifth. You owe me an explanation for this. You've been lying to me, and I'm doing my best to defend you! What am I supposed to think? I trusted you. And now you don't? You could go to prison. I would rather spend the rest of my coherent days or months in prison than drag Karen's name through the mud! Were you in her house? Yes. What about the blood? I don't know. My memory is spotty. I might've stepped on something. Dad, you need to do better than this. The boot print. I remember fixing a light. Okay. Okay, did she receive any threats? Did she have any stalkers? Do you remember anything suspicious when you were with her, like someone following her? I don't remember any significant details, no. Dad, I need something! [Sobbing chuckles] Do you think this is easy? Everything that I am is just... slipping away. Sometimes I feel like it's already gone. Shelby, I'm sorry. It's okay, Dad. I mean, I'm really sorry about this. [Sighs] [judge] What issues do you wish to discuss before I bring the jury back in? A recent follow‐up search done by one of our investigators revealed this medicine bottle with the defendant's name on it inside Karen Donovan's beach condo. Your Honor, the state can't introduce new evidence piecemeal to the jury in the middle of a trial. I can't believe you're considering this. We need time to take depositions and determine a chain of custody. This can't be done carelessly, let alone during a capital murder case. She has a point. How do you plan to prove that this medicine belonged to the defendant? Your Honor, in order to understand the relationship between this new evidence in our case, we wish to amend our witness list to include Beth Hardington, a friend of Karen Donovan's. Your Honor, it's too late for a new witness. We didn't learn about this witness until recently. She is vital to our case, as she ties the defendant to the victim and establishes motive. Okay, I'll allow it. Court will re‐convene at 2:00 p.m. [strikes gavel] [phone buzzes] Give me good news, Freddy. I found the sister of Bill Garrison, false Daedalus number one. She got married twice, went through two different last names, plus she didn't publicize her relationship, ‐for obvious reasons. ‐Okay. Whatever she can tell you will be a big help. Good work, Freddy. Here you go, Bandit. Oh, I just love my horses! Bandit, you are such a charmer. He seems like a real cowboy's horse. He was Bill's horse. I've been taking care of him since Bill passed away four years ago. He had a tough time after the trial, even after he was exonerated? [Laughs] Oh, well, he was a little bit of a celebrity at first. He used it to get girls. But when the celebrity faded... the notoriety remained. Do you remember anything about how he wound up getting accused? We're trying to see how Daedalus goes about framing people. Well, I'm afraid I won't be of much help. It was‐‐ it was an accident! Bill was in the wrong place at the wrong time. Did he ever meet any of the other false Daedaluses? Not that I know of. I mean, being accused of something like that is a... it's a dark chapter in a man's life. You don't go around starting a club about it. You know, he used to take long walks at night. Insomnia. And he had cans of red spray paint in his home. That was all they needed. So, he wasn't actually framed. No. No, just bad luck, I guess. So, Miss Hardington, you knew Ms. Donovan was having an affair? Well, after I saw Karen at Coral Shoals, I sure did. Why didn't you come forward with that information earlier? I didn't want to see her family dragged through a scandal, and it didn't seem relevant. And did you talk to her about this affair? Not at first. Even though I saw Karen at Coral Shoals, and she saw me see her, I didn't make a fuss about it. Girls need their secrets. Anyway, a few days before she died, we met for lattes, and she was upset. ‐About what? ‐She'd gotten into an argument. At first I thought it was with her husband, but she didn't typically get all heated up over the governor. Sure enough, it was with her guy friend. What was the fight about? Well, Karen didn't really give me all the juicy bits, but... [sighs] he was jealous. Karen said that he wanted her to get a divorce, and when she hesitated he called her a heartless, using bitch. He apologized later, but things changed for Karen after that. You haven't said a word to me since court. You didn't think that was the sort of thing I needed to know? It was nothing. I was upset. It was the first time that I had opened myself up since your mother died, and I could see it slipping away. Now you remember details. You think I can control this? I can't anymore. I need to know everything you remember right now. Can you do that, Dad? I'll try. We met at a charity event. She was there with her husband, who spent the night hobnobbing with everybody, so we spent most of the night talking to each other. She was bright, she was beautiful. She reminded me of your mother. She asked if she could call me and talk about something personal, so we met for coffee, and she told me she wanted my legal advice about getting a divorce. Can anyone corroborate that? No, I don't think so, because she's very private and discreet. And it wasn't long before we weren't talking about divorce anymore; we were talking about us. ‐But you did fight. ‐We argued because I wanted more, because I knew my time was running out and I wanted to spend what time I had with her in the open, not hiding. She held back because she knew I had an expiration date. And that was the last time I saw her. I am tired of you holding back on me. I will not let you die in prison. [Sighs] [phone buzzes] Freddy. Please give me some good news. I need some. Bill Garrison died four years ago, but he wasn't actually framed. He was just in the wrong place at the wrong time. I think what happened to Bill inspired Daedalus to frame the others. I think he got excited by the idea that he could manipulate the entire legal system. Okay. What about the other two? Well, I'm having real trouble tracking down number three, Ogden. I'm gonna need some help with that. But number two, Reggie Carvano, actually has a fan page. Now, I don't know if these freaks think that he's actually Daedalus, or if they just admire his proximity to Daedalus. ‐Okay. ‐But I arranged an interview with a girl who says she slept with him. Super creepy, but again, good work, Freddy. You know, some of these chicks are pretty hot. I should get a prison record. Okay. On that note, good night, Freddy. Dad, what do you‐‐ Unh! ‐Shelby! ‐ [Gasping] ‐Hey! Hey! ‐You murdering son of a bitch! ‐No! No! No! ‐Get out of the way! ‐Shelby, move! ‐No! My dad didn't kill anyone! My wife's dead 'cause of him! If you want to kill me, that is your decision, but please leave my daughter alone. Please. [Sobbing] No! [Grunting] ‐You okay? ‐ [Man sobbing] ‐Yeah. ‐Okay. Come on. He killed my wife! No scratches. Oh... That was Hernan Castillo. His wife Anne Castillo was murdered by Daedalus three years ago, and he's been in and out of counseling ever since. What about the other stalker? Well, we've got people watching your house 24/7 now, so that won't happen again. You've been watching us. I've been checking in. You weren't just checking in. [Chuckles] Good night. So, uh, wh‐what's your real name, anyway? Icarus. I got my name changed legally. So, um, did you think that Reggie was really Daedalus? Mm, I wasn't sure at first. It's kind of like, I wanted to believe, so I saw what I wanted to see, you know? Yeah. But then we had sex, and it was so ordinary that I knew it couldn't be him. Oh, yeah. Right. I thought I'd be filled with this, like, terrible dark light, you know? Yeah. Oh, yeah. I guess it would be a memorable experience. But Reggie was touched by Daedalus. He was a hand‐picked piece on Daedalus's chessboard. I felt that a little. Like an aura. Um, okay. Did Reggie ever, uh, talk about how he was framed? The way Daedalus trapped Reggie is that he plays a spiral seashell on his favorite table at a cafe Reggie liked. Yeah, like the Greek myth, right, the seashell riddle the king of Crete used to discover the secret identity of Daedalus. You are really cute. [Chuckles] Aw, it's just Wikipedia, you know. After Reggie moved the shell, putting his fingerprints on it, Daedalus then placed the shell at his next crime scene. Like the carpet nails. So, okay, well, why Reggie? Why not Ogden or Garrison? Garrison was so old. I was only 19 when he died. And he was too pathetic. Ogden was too intense for me. I wanted to work up to meeting him. Reggie was supposed to introduce us before he died. Wait, Reggie knew Ogden? Yeah. He talked about him all the time. They're kind of, like, in a special club, you know? When did Reggie die? About a month before that Donovan chick ate it. His house burned down with him in it. ‐It was arson? ‐Smoking. Or at least that's what the cops said. Did they ever investigate for arson? A guy like Reggie dies, nobody cares. Nobody investigates. Hmm. Sweetheart, it's after midnight. You have to get some sleep. You've had a long day. I can't sleep. Dad, I don't know what I'm gonna do tomorrow. You'll think of something, but you've gotta give your brain a rest. We're out of time, Dad. I've got no one left to call, no more witnesses, no more expert testimony. I can't just show up in court and spin my wheels. Maybe it's enough already. No. I'm not gonna take chances with your life. I remember the first time I saw you in trial. [Laughs] Oh, God. That was awful. You made some mistakes, but your gift is always knowing how to get to the truth. ‐Truth doesn't always win. ‐No. But knowing how to find it is important, even if you lose. [Phone vibrating] Speaking of finding the truth... It's Freddy. Excuse me. Hey! What do you know? James Ogden and Reggie Carvano met each other? That's what she said, and then Carvano ended up dead, suspiciously. We have to talk to Ogden. ‐Yeah. ‐I might know someone who can help us get his address and his driver's license. Already did it. You accessed the DMV database? Eh, I can neither confirm nor deny that informa... ‐What did you find? ‐Useless, two years out of date, moves around a lot. Damn it. Did you find anything else? Nah. I mean, he's got an online presence. Oof. He didn't age well. Prison, then his wife and child left him. What if he's trying to get revenge on your dad? No. My father was eminently fair to him at trial. Well, after what happened to Ogden, would he ever care about fair? I mean, I bet he's mad at the whole world. He did sue. He got a generous settlement, monthly stipend for the rest of his life. Would that make up for losing everything else? Probably not. Wait. They have to mail those checks somewhere. I know someone who can get us that address. Okay. Okay, Shelby, I can handle this. You've got the trial in the morning. I'm running out of time, Freddy. Sleep is for the dead. Okay, well, I'm coming with you. I'm coming with you. [Siren wailing] And just stepped on a syringe. The junkies are more afraid of you than you are of them, Freddy. Mmm... That deadbeat disappeared about two months ago, still owes me a week's rent. Was it before or after the Karen Donovan murder? Oh, yeah, that. Maybe right before? But he left all his stuff! ‐Can we go through it? ‐Shit, you can have it. ‐Great. ‐If you pay me his last week's rent. ‐Fair enough. ‐Yep, it's fair. Can we go through the room he was staying in? Sure. It ain't clean, but help yourself. ‐ [Slides credit card] ‐Checkout is noon. I'll add it to your tab. Well, Ogden left in a hurry. And I'd like to know why. Maybe he's lying dead in a ditch somewhere, you know, of something stupid and random like a heart attack or an accident. Or maybe we're missing something. Hey‐ho! Porn in magazine form? How retro. Oh, hell, am I really gonna have to touch these? [Laughs] The man who chooses to travel down these mean streets must have courage, Freddy. [Imitates laugh] Aw, yuck. ‐There's something in here. ‐What's that? What the hell? That's a P. G. P. Key. ‐A what? ‐P. G. P. P.G.P. stands for "pretty good privacy." It's an open source cryptography method, and by "pretty good," they actually mean unbreakable given current and foreseen technology. Now, there are two keys. Right, these long sequence of symbols, and a public key that the user posts in the open. "Real serial killer memorabilia for trade or sale." ‐He's marketing himself! ‐Anonymously. So he signs the message with a public key and a screen name. Then customers reply someplace on the Internet, Ogden downloads this anonymously, via proxy or public wireless. Okay. Someone's trading a John Wayne Gacy memento for a Daedalus one. Looks like they've done this before. And... we've got an address. James Ogden's secret lair. Think there's anybody home? I guess nobody's home. Are you okay? You think that was a trap? I think if were a trap, you'd be missing a foot. Oh, man. Wait. What? This step should've collapsed ages ago. Ogden never uses this door. Hey, hey, just be careful with the‐‐ There's‐‐ Just be careful. Great. Great. ‐Oh! ‐Everything okay? Yeah. Oh, my God. The labyrinth stencil. If we'd come in through the front, this whole place would've gone up in flames. I'd better get some back‐up proof. Ogden was the one watching us. [Shutter clicking] Ogden. And Garvano. And Garrison. They were working together. They were all Daedalus. That's how they were able to clear each other's names. This is it. Ogden killed Karen Donovan. And now we can prove it. Aah! Stop! Freeze! [Gasping] Ogden... [Shelby] Your Honor, we would like to move defendant's exhibits 67 through 82 into evidence. Objection! This is far too much evidence to introduce so late into trial. Your Honor, the state has no right to object given the amount of evidence they've added. Well, I agree, Counselor, overruled. Defendant's exhibits 67 to 82 are marked into evidence. Mr. Cook, what are we looking at on these whiteboards? These photographs and pictured objects were all recovered from Mr. James Ogden's trailer. ‐And who is James Ogden? ‐He was the third man originally convicted for the Daedalus crimes. He was then set free. What is the significance of this photo? That teddy bear belonged to Karen Donovan. It disappeared the night she was murdered. And why is that important? Daedalus always steals a trophy from the crime scene. This time, it happened to be the teddy bear. These other items that you see on the board are all believed to be trophies taken from other Daedalus crimes. The police are checking them against their list now. What is this stencil? The stencil in the photograph matches the paint color and labyrinth patterns painted next to the victims' bodies. Who is this in this photo? [Freddy] That is Bill Garrison, the first man accused of being Daedalus, and he is standing over the body of Roxanne Wyland, Daedalus victim number eight, killed on March 25th, 1974. ‐Here. ‐Reggie Carvano. False Daedalus number two with Michelle Waring, victim number 18, 1985. James Ogden, posing with murder victim Anne Castillo. Bill Garrison with Gladys Morlow, 1971. The first labyrinth. That's a group photo of Reggie Carvano, James Ogden, and Bill Garrison, all three of the men who previously went to trial for the Daedalus killings. What do you make of that? All three of them were actually Daedalus, and they were working together. That way they could provide alibis for each other when they got into trouble. I assume you have another application, Counselor? Yes, Your Honor. In light of the overwhelming evidence... the defense moves to dismiss all charges against the defendant. Huh. Would the state prefer a recess to consider? The state does not oppose the motion, Your Honor. Judge Anderson, on behalf of the criminal system, the state, and this court, I apologize as a fellow civil servant that you had to stand up to all these charges. I'm proud to see that justice prevailed. Charges are dismissed. [Gavel bangs] I never doubted you could do it. I'm so proud of you. I'm so proud of you. Thank you, baby. Thank you. Recycling? Shelby. Um, no. No. Nothing gets recycled, but it will buried on a back shelf somewhere next to the Ark of the Covenant. ‐I want to ‐‐ ‐Wait. No. Let me start. I'm glad you came by. And you know what? I'm glad you won, because otherwise I would've lost you forever. Thank you. I want you to come back and work with me again. ‐Really? ‐Absolutely. Frankly, I'm even more impressed now that we went head to head. I'd like that. ‐Yeah? Good. ‐Yeah. But first, if it's okay, I need to spend a little quality time with my dad. It's been a rough ride. Of course. Decompress. You need it. But don't totally decompress, 'cause I could use your help around here, ‐and I don't need you getting rusty. ‐Definitely. Oh, one more thing. We, uh, recovered about two‐thirds of the mementos from Ogden's trailer. The others are missing. We think he sold them in that online trading ring that you and your private detective discovered. ‐We'd like your help with that. ‐Absolutely. There is a lot of Internet to search. [Chuckles] Yeah. I'm glad you're back. [Sighs] And you... are my memento. [Printer whirring] ‐Hey. ‐Hey. What are you doing here? Well, I just dropped by the house to apologize to your dad. I mean, I know protecting you and your father doesn't make up for what I did, but, yeah, I was just hoping you and I could have a fresh start. I know you were just doing your job. ‐Well... ‐Well, I mean‐‐ Not just your job. You were doing what you thought was right. Well, I'm glad I was wrong. So am I. ‐Okay. ‐I'll see you around, Mike. See you. How many famous detectives caught three serial killers in one night? I'm gonna say none. Who took that photo? Come on, Shelby, come on! [Phone vibrating] Hello, this is Shelby Anderson. I'm not available right now. [Tone whooshes] [vibrating] [line ringing] [man] Los Angeles Police Department. [Galen] Shelby? You're back early. Yeah, just a quick run today. Hey, Dad, have you seen my phone? [Galen] No. [Mike's voice] Did your dad give that to you? Yeah, he gave me everything. Oh, my God. [Buzzing] [muffled screams] [Galen] Shelby? Shelby. Shelby, I am so proud of you. You were absolutely perfect, perfect! You helped me pull off the grand finale. Don't you see? We did it together. This only brings us closer. Shelby, my Alzheimer's is real. Maybe not as debilitating as I've led people to believe, but... I knew it was only a matter of time until I wouldn't be able to remember the scent of death. And I needed to conduct one last act before taking the final bow. But why get caught? Why the trial, why the big show? I wanted them to suspect, to come within inches of catching me, inches of believing that I was Daedalus, and then to have their case just fall apart. It was so beautiful, thanks to you. Shelby, you would be astounded at the kind of admiration a man like Daedalus gets. I have my acolytes, and they help me execute the plans that I crafted, I crafted them! The first one grew sloppy, and I helped him win at trial. Carvano and Ogden, they were much more dedicated. Though I did let Ogden take the fall for Karen's murder. But the world thinks Ogden is Daedalus, and now he's dead. Exactly. But the Daedalus legacy can live on. ‐What? ‐Sweetheart, you. You can take up where I left off. It'll be perfect. My death will prove that I could never be involved, and they'll never suspect you. Daedalus can be immortal. You're insane. You're smart, Shelby. You can do this. I've left instructions and suggestions in encrypted files on my computer. You were always an excellent student. Then let me out. Let me out. And I'll help you. I have to know I can trust you first. I'm your daughter. Remember? You made me. Let me out, and I can prove myself to you. I can tell when you're lying to me, Shelby. I'm your father. Let me out. Let me out! Let me out! I love you, Shelby. Truly, you are my masterpiece, and I wish it didn't have to end this way, but I can't say that I didn't prepare for it. [Car alarm chirps, engine revs] No, don't. That won't do any good. Even if you get in, you can't turn the engine off or open the hood. I fixed it. I prepared for this exact moment. [Coughing] Just like I did in your mother's car. What? She started seeing someone, Shelby. She betrayed me, and Daedalus kills women who cheat. And I was living with someone doing just that. [Coughing] The irony. Heh. I guess I just didn't provide the companionship she required, but that does not excuse her behavior, and I was not gonna let that cheating whore ruin your life. I'm only upset that I had to disguise your mother's death as an accident and not a true Daedalus killing. Huh. [Shelby coughing] Shelby... Whoops. Dead end, Shelby. You better hurry. The carbon monoxide's gonna fill the crawlspace. Come on, Shelby. Come on. Shelby... this is how it has to be. [Shelby struggling] [Shelby coughing] I'm sorry, Shelby. You shouldn't have to die. It should be me. I should've been Daedalus's next victim. They'll never understand the pain, the emotional pain I've caused you. The emotional pain. The worst kind of pain. The worst kind of pain. ‐ [Rings doorbell] ‐Shelby? ‐Shelby! ‐ [Coughing] Daedalus will avenge you. You're crazy! It's almost done now. Daedalus is making me hear you die and using my love for you to lead me to my own death. I go into the crawlspace to rescue you, but the trap is barricaded by another trap, sealing me in with poison gas. And I'm killed by love. I'm killed by love! [Coughing] A tragic and poetic end. Shelby? Shelby. I know you better than anyone, remember? Why do you have to be so difficult? Don't you know you can be a legend? Aah! [Mike] Shelby! Shelby! Jesus. It's over. Come on. Come on. Let's get out of here. Come on. It's over. It's okay. ‐It's okay. ‐It was him. It was him all along. ‐You were right. ‐I know. He fooled everybody. It's okay. Come here. It's okay. You know, I've... I've studied and admired your work for years, sir. It is a pleasure to finally meet you face to face. You set this whole thing up, didn't you? Our mutual friend tells me you're curious. I wanna learn. Then do your job. I have a plan, and you'll know when you're needed.
