Salt Lake City. Built on gold and God. It's a thriving place reinventing its identity. These four people have figured out ways to make money here that as unusual as the city they call home. Probably about 80% of the time I hope I look like I know what I'm doing right now, but I really just feel like I'm drowning. I had everything lined up to be the perfect Mormon. Companies need to make money. And if they're gonna pay you to do so, you've gotta be able to perform. As a kid I was always pretty poor, so I couldn't have that much. And then as an adult now, I've kinda spoiled myself. One city, four people, and where they live is a key part of who they are. * I found a place to sell my name * * Along the market's promenade * High prices * * Going down * Oh the rice is burning brown * And high prices * Going down * Salt Lake City. It's the Mormon equivalent of Vatican City, and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints owns a lot of assets, an estimated 35 billion worth. Even though its monuments cast a long shadow over the city, only half its people are practicing Mormons. * Sexual repression has given way to nation-high online porn consumption. And the place that once poured money into anti-gay legislation is now run by a lesbian mayor. This town is in the midst of a culture shift. This is Andy over at Remnant Preservations. I'm just calling to let you know that your mule deer is ready to pick up. Hey Kelly, it's Andy over at Remnant Preservations. I'm just calling to let you know that your Europeans on those bears are all done. Hey Kayleen, it's Andy. I'm just calling to let you know that I've got your mouse all done up. I've been trying to get a hold of you for a couple of weeks now, so if you can please get... This voicemail box is full. Please try again later. Thank you for calling. Chasing after customers to get them to pick up is probably the most frustrating part about the business, 'cause that's money that's already done. I've already put the work into it. Andrea has just started her own taxidermy business. In a state where hunters spend half a billion dollars every year, her business has great potential if she can manage her money. If I could do this job and not get paid for it, and just like miraculously my bills would be taken are of, I easily would do that. If I want to continue and perpetuate this business, I kind of have to hold money at like a higher level than I actually really want to. This is the freeze dryer. This is where we do anything under 31 inches, primarily pets. I'm the only one in Utah who works on pets. If I'm having a slow hunting season, I can count on the pets. This cost us $15,000, definitely the most expensive thing that we have in the shop, and it costs about $400 a month to run. When I first opened the shop, I had a private investor who was willing to invest about $38,000. So it was a very, very terrifying chunk of money. I have not started his payments yet. My goal is to have it completely paid off in about 4 years. That might be a little optimistic, but I wouldn't be doing this if I wasn't a little optimistic anyways. A house on the northern edge of town is the unlikely location for Salt Lake City's small hardcore music scene, where money is not the motivation. The way I look at money is it's nothing to me. 'Cause you could use it to help everyone, but people don't. I'm actually in a lot of bands right now, but the main one I put the main focus into is Nelson Muntz. The genre of music we play, there's like a lot of faux tough guys. We'd thought from watching Simpsons for years and years, we were always like, "Nelson Muntz, he's the toughest." But it's funny, 'cause he's like really sad inside, 'cause of like his bad childhood. I was 9 years old when my dad got taken away, and then 10 years old, that's when my mom got taken away. * Was that good? - Yeah. - Alright. So my mom and dad went on a trip when I was a kid. The trip ended days later with my mom coming back telling me that my dad got taken to jail. And then later on they came back for her. * My dad had always done shady things to try to make money, like selling drugs and stuff and like smuggling drugs. * He's just a crazy fucking dumb guy. I'd like to think my mom is smart enough to know, but I guess love makes you do dumb things. With both parents in jail, Conrad spent six years bouncing around from relative to relative, eventually settling in with his brother Sam. I don't think we played it as well last time. I tell you we got a set list, we should add those ones in there. Nelson Muntz brings in a bit of money but it's not enough for like anything. And I'd say most times I break even. Are you gonna try and get those screens? And then we can start screen printing soon? Fucking sweet. I print shirts and stuff. This is probably the only profitable part about it 'cause like people like buying shirts for some reason. I just never wanted to go through the trouble that I've seen my dad go through. It just wouldn't be worth doing that to make whatever little amount of money you make. Because you make a big mistake, you basically lose everything. * Salt Lake is a hub for outdoor sports, d for sponsored skier Kalen, 's sometimes home base. * I lived in various places in Salt Lake. I was here for nine years but I technically can't call anywhere home 'cause there's nowhere I actually wanna plant roots as of now. So Salt Lake is just another stop on the adventure. My name is Kalen Thorien. I'm 27 years old and I'm a professional skier and adventurer. Typical Utah, it was crazy yesterday, it was full on torrential downpours, the roads were flooding and now it's sunny. * Pro skiers like Kalen have to continuously travel to book gigs. * I was actually pursuing a firefighting career. I was like "Oh this is something I could do for the rest of my life, 401ks, retirement, government work," you name it and there was something not right. Being stagnant like that and being so normal caused me to freak out a little bit. So I tried to find any sort of way to separate myself from the masses. This is the top. Ah, here we are. * I moved to Utah and became a ski bum, and I completely fell in love with it. * I'd say I was about 24 years old, actually got the title as a sponsored skier and then I was able to start making a living off of it. It can get competitive because there's always some new young gun, coming up in the field. Like when I finally was able to make a living off of this I really just wanted to kick up my feet and enjoy it for a little bit. But it was like you know you just keep plugging away because it could be gone just like that. Jake grew up Mormon in Salt Lake City but now he's lost his faith. My name is Jake Jones. I go to school at Utah Valley University. I'm studying entrepreneurship. I was the guy that knocked on your door and said "You want to learn about Jesus?" My family goes back to the first settlers. My mom and dad were both raised in the faith. I was really active in the youth groups all throughout high school and then just like the good Mormon boy does I went on the two year mission. White shirts, ties, clean cut, riding the bike, knocking on your door. That was me. It wasn't until I was serving the end of my two year mission in Michigan where I started to have serious doubts. I saw problems with how the belief structure worked. Circular reasoning, self-confirming doctrine. I was definitely on a different page than my parents. I haven't really talked to my parents about my lack of faith because I guess I'm afraid of the conversation. If I told them everything the worst case scenario would be they could disown me. You're on your own now. We're kind of dropping off support and they're helping heavily, almost completely with my college education right now. That is a great concern because I would have to work harder and make sure I'm a bit more diligent with finances. I'm gonna tell my parents the extent of my disbelief, because there are some things that are just worth more than money. And that's being true to yourself. The first Mormons called Salt Lake City "Kingdom of Heaven on Earth," but this heaven places a lot of emphasis on earthly wealth. It's a mash up of church and corporate empire, with holy holdings fuelled by $7 billion in annual donations, all wired directly to Salt lake City Elders. * So we're in downtown right now. The church has lots and lots of like land holdings, and they literally own most of the property around downtown Salt Lake. Part of the Mormon doctrine and pretty wide spread in just Christian doctrine is tithing. Tithing is where you give 10% of your income to the church. So it's like a sign of devotion, it's required if you wanna be considered like, fully active and contributing, that you pay the 10%. I've heard estimates that the total that the church gets through tithing is around $5 billion a year. There's a lot of wealthy Mormons. Jake's decided he no longer wants to be Mormon. But by cutting ties with the church his parents might cut him off. If my personal decision to leave the faith did cause a schism in my relationship with my parents, the entire Utah culture and all of these monuments and establishments would be a constant reminder of that rift. I think it does give a little bit more reason to just clean slate, move somewhere else where Mormonism just isn't as big a deal. * Renters in Salt Lake City spend on average around $761 in rent per month. Andrea pays way less than that. And here it all is. It's actually my first time living by myself, which has been quite the adjustment. Before this I was living in a house with 10 people. The square footage for this apartment is 298 square feet I believe. And the rent is 393 a month. It is considered low income housing but I've kind of come to love it just because it's mine and nobody else's, so that's pretty good. Kenny was, is, was my best friend and the love of my life, and he actually shot himself in August... playing Russian roulette by himself. That was the first Valentine's Day present he gave me. His mom had gotten a hold of me, she was really concerned, so I drove over to his house, and I found him in his bedroom on the ground. He had been dead for some time by that point. Kenny was my biggest cheerleader with opening the shop. It was kind of adorable how excited he would get at the things that I was doing. I took a month and a half off and everyone didn't think that I would keep the shop open, that I would wind up shutting it down 'cause I would have to be working with death on a daily basis. And I was like, Kenny would be pissed if he knew I was even considering shutting down the shop. Knowing how much he supported me definitely helped me wanna make sure that it didn't fail. And that I didn't just give up on it and walk away from it. Professional skier Kalen has come to town to make a little money. Instead the trip is costing her. Here we're at a KOA which is a campgrounds of America, it's typically not ideal. This spot right here is about 55 a night which almost seems like a rip off 'cause I might as well go stay at a hotel. And this is Frances. That's my girl! Driving into Salt Lake I noticed my car had sprayed oil pretty much everywhere. I'm hoping that these fixes are pretty minor. She's a 1986 diesel Land Cruiser and there was only about a 1,000 of this model made and so to find parts for it and to repair it is a little tricky sometimes. So I noticed that the oil filter was getting kind of loose, so yeah, I'm hoping just drop her off and you guys can take a look. - Drop her off. - I think it's mellow. Mine used to do that I think it's that diesel that vibrates gets all crazy. Shakes the filter out. Alrighty. Thanks buddy. I'm in this weird little rental car here and it's way too fancy. I'm hoping Frances gets fixed today which it totally can if they can find the part. If not then I guess I'll have to stay at the campground, it's kind of a bummer. * I don't know where to go from there, it's all I got. I'm shopping for some screens, some screen printing ink. We gotta get some shirts done hopefully make some money to eat, to get gas, to... Hopefully break even. Hopefully get close to breaking even. But you know it's stuff you do when you're in a band. The screens are pretty expensive but once you have the screens, you can keep printing stuff on them. Selling each shirt for 10 bucks a piece so we sell a hundred we could possibly make a 1,000 bucks off of it but there's like almost no chance that we'll sell every shirt. It's a pretty big if. Yeah like it's just not gonna happen. It'd be nice. 89.36. Just swipe? I remember I bought a bunch of tapes and cases and that came out to be like 200, 250 almost. And it's not bad but it's kind of a lot when you-some months when you look at your wallet and you're like, "Oh I spent more than I should have this month." I wrote my expenses for the label down once and, I don't know, I guess I didn't like looking at the money that like I was putting into it. I'd rather just have the cool product come out of it. What's up Brad? It's about time you got some new screens, fucking slouch. This is us. Nelson Muntz, kind of used to be in this band, Satanic Hispanic. Oh this is his solo project Bill Murray. You making any money off the label? Nah not too much. - Putting it all back. - Yeah basically. Circulating it. These going with you? Yea, I'm going to take these two. Okay sounds great. 61.81 on that. Give me that card, you loser. Gotta keep the money moving. The Salt Lake City area supports a thriving winter sports industry, with skiing contributing 1.29 billion in revenue and 20,000 jobs to the state of Utah. Kalen's figured out how to turn her skiing skills into money. Getting out with photographers and with my sponsors to shoot photos. So this is exactly how I make my living. We'll probably go right to the top of that. If you notice it's a slightly male dominated group that's pretty common in this sport. We usually have one girl and a bunch of guys. For a woman to actually make a living in this field, solely, it's very difficult, it's very rare. There's only a handful of us. Oh yeah, let's do it. Get 'er done. * I have companies, brands that sponsor me and they pay me. In exchange I'm an ambassador for their product. * I have a dozen sponsors but only four of them pay me like an actual salary. And then the other ones are product which is great because I pretty much don't have to pay for anything that I use. And then I can go to a lot of my sponsors if I have a trip idea and you know they'll pay for it. And so you can find a lot of ways you can kind of get things for free which kind of makes the salary irrelevant almost. * Within a year I make 40,000 from my sponsors. I'm getting consistent pay cheques and I can put food on my table and then some. I'm terrified of the idea of having a normal job again so I'm gonna try to keep this going as best I can. Jake's done the math of what will happen if his parents cut him off. My parents help me almost completely with my tuition. I think it's right around 3 or 4,000. My car is paid for but my dad gave me the car. I'm on the phone plan for the family. I'm on the health insurance, car insurance, dental insurance. If my dad really wanted to say fine do your own thing. It would be challenging. Jake knows he's financially dependent on his parents, so he's trying to make some money of his own. Just got an order. I'm now working for a new start-up company which is like a food delivery service. This company has a lot of great potential and if they're willing to take me in then I'm willing to work with them and push the company to its greatest potential. In ten years I wanna be financially secure. Wealthy. In one way or another I'm gonna be a millionaire. What's up? Got your food. So he gave me 5 stars, so 5 out of 5 that's what I'm talking about. So that run took about 15-20 minutes and I made 4 dollars off it so that would be around 12 dollars an hour after gas, 10 dollars. Yeah totally worth it. * When it's not hunting season, business can lag for Andrea. To make up her shortfall she takes requests to work on roadkill retrieved from the highway. We are headed to a friend's house. She's got a roadkill deer that she wants gutted and defleshed so she can keep the bones on it. I'm not getting paid a lot for it maybe a couple hundred bucks. I actually like the break from the traditional taxidermy. Behind my passenger there's bags and a battery and the saw, can you grab those? It's a big job so Andrea's friend Alan has offered to help. She's already been gutted but obviously not skinned or anything. It's a girl? Let's get to it then. I'm going to finish stripping off all of the meat on this and then we're gonna cut it up into pieces so we can take it back to the shop. Not to eat it. I do have a lot of people who are just kind of like, morbidly curious about working with death essentially, dead animals and animal remains. I would not be able to afford paying someone every time I needed help on the spot like this. - Alan does not get paid. - I just do it for fun. Yeah it is. Alright we're gonna cut his head off now. Money and I have a severe hate hate love relationship I would say. I hate everything that money does to people definitely. But I need it to continue doing the things I love. But it's not something I'll ever want in excess, so hate hate love. * I started working at Einstein Bagels in September of last year. I work 40 hours a week and I make a bit above minimum wage. It's about 3:25, public transportation ain't up till about 5:00, close to 6:00-ish. It's tough getting up sometimes. * Yeah I'd only had one other job before that I started working at Taco Bell. And I worked there for a year which I think is the turning point for most fast food jobs. Hard to keep people there for what they pay you, and what you have to deal with. * I hate the fact that I do have to work this job to survive but it's good for the time being I guess. Damn it! Mormons leaving the faith run the risk of being socially shunned, getting expelled or losing employment. Jake's afraid to tell his parents he no longer believes but he's found a support group to help him out. - I'm Jake. - Hi Jake. It's important that there's a safe place where people who've come out of the church can kind of know they're not crazy. There are other people that are like them, and they can feel accepted. This group started four years ago with like three people. Now we have about 1700 to 1800 people. It was so hard. I was so depressed. And I'm isolated in this little world. And it's interesting after I shared on Facebook coming out just today. Wait, did you say today? Yeah, she came out on Facebook today. Whoa! It's been a really good day today. How's your family been doing with your exit? That's a really interesting question. My parents still don't know. It's really fear of hurting them and our relationship. I've heard of parents say things like "It would be better to me if you were dead than to tell me that you don't believe anymore," so the ramifications from a financial perspective, yeah that's all wrapped up in that whole devastation. Yeah I'm somewhat concerned that my roommate finds out or my employer. Those prejudice is unconscious if an employer is looking at two different job candidates without realizing it they're gonna gravitate to the one who is speaking the Mormon language. I know it's pretty intimidating when you haven't come out, especially to your parents. But hiding it is a burden, it's tiresome. Hearing stories is so helpful. - Oh it is. - So helpful. * Welcome to Casa di Big Foot. It's a no bedroom house with a small bathroom but yeah this is it's a little 17 foot fibreglass trailer. This is my dining area/office. Way down at the other end of the trailer is the bedroom. This is my bathroom, so it's actually turned into my gear closet. I pee outside or I have these little poop bags, open it, suction cup it on there and just let er rip. I get paid to create these stories or these adventures and they're documented and those will either go to magazines or online content and social media of course. Especially Instagram. I do $500 per post and that's an exclusive product post. But it still has to be authentic. I am almost at 59,000 followers. Seems to grow about a 100 a day. I wouldn't be modeling if you know, I wasn't a cute blonde girl but I think I've managed to stay out of that being what defines me. What gave me my edge was just-I'm able to create, produce, market, do everything on my own. An adult couple making minimum wage in Salt Lake City spends over $500 a month on food and household products. It's the one high cost Conrad and his girlfriend Vaenka have to manage. We drive out here even though it's not the closest one. The one by our house is just more expensive so it's worth it to drive out here. We've been together three years this February. She has expenses like a car, car insurance and health insurance and a bunch of stuff. God dammit! They don't have that toilet paper. Yeah they're out of that one, do you wanna just get those ones? Yeah it's fucking more expensive this way though. I don't have very many bills actually. My main expenses would be like eating out and groceries, just eating food in general. I think we did pretty good. Can we split it up between two cards? Sure. Okee dokee. If I stay there long enough and just look at things I'll tend to get it 'cause I come from-when you're a kid and your parents are like "No you can't get that." "Why?" "Cause you can't afford it." Well I have money so I'll buy whatever I want. The other day I ordered like two pounds of pistachios on the internet. And I was like "What else can you order on the internet?" And apparently you can just bulk order a bunch of candy. So I got like two pound bag of lemonheads, a five pound bag of gummy cherries. Display thing of zowers you know those dum dum suckers. I got only the blue ones 'cause that's the only flavour I like. When I was doing it I was like hmm is this that smart to do? And then I realized, yes. * While Conrad likes to blow some of his money. Andrea and her friends find a way to save theirs. We're dumpstering for produce right now. Which is one of my favourite ways to get food. And they just throw out everything for new good reason, seemingly. If one banana goes bad in a bunch they throw the whole bunch away. Look at that, look at this, look at the basil, look at that basil. That's stupid. That's so stupid exciting. It's one of those things where it makes you sad that there's this much food waste but like really grateful for it because like none of it is bad so we get it. I would say this is easily $400. Yeah easily. Since I started dumpster diving I don't think I've paid for produce or macaroons. Corporate waste on three. 1, 2, 3... Corporate waste. Sick. Conrad gets his pay cheque after 80 hours of work at a bagel shop. So I just got paid. So now I gotta go give my half for rent together and then walk down to my landlord and pay my rent. I got paid 464.29 that's over a span of two weeks. * My share of the rent is 238. This is collectively what me, my brother, my girlfriend and my other roommate pay for rent. * I try to save money but it just- like if I need it I'll take the money. I'd like to save up to get a van or something but it's just a lot of money to save right now and I don't even have my license so. It's just a little bit painful to pay for the bad house I live in. When I look at their house and how nice it is. To hear some of that diesel engine purr... Ah. It just makes me so happy, it's the sound of freedom. Kalen's truck is fixed and she's made $500 from her sponsors, enough to get her back on the road, chasing snow and money to the north. I never get tired of life on the road. I don't even think about it. * Keep my future on the horizon but by no means am I stressing about it. Whether or not it's the career that I had in mind, maybe not. But things are always evolving and changing. Andrea is seeking new venues to expand her business. Oh hello. And if it works out she'll be able to start paying off her investor. I'm getting whored up so I can go sell some skulls tonight at our event at Metro. The whole ordeal of doing an event and getting dressed up, all of it is a necessity that I'd rather do without. But yet I can't afford not to be doing that right now. The sex sells, kids. * So these ones right here are 30, these ones right here are 20, we've got boxes and an opossum right there. Oh, wow! * To hit my goal for the night I have to get another $530, but there's enough people here so I'm gonna go through and round them all up and be like "Hey come up to the stand, it's okay like look at what we've got." So far I haven't had any bars request for me to give them a cut of anything I make and I think that a part of that is because I do tend to bring quite the crowd when I do these. So they kind of get their compensation through drinks and what not. So with tax it's gonna be 320.40, is that okay? Okay thank you. So tonight we ended with 940 which is more than my baseline for the night. I'm super happy with the way the night went. Jake spends some down time with his friend Cody while he figures out how to tell his parents. Alright homeboy. * When are you telling your parents? Ah I don't know. Are you gonna be disowned? Can I live with you if I do? No. I am writing the tell-all letter to my parents. I do not know what they're gonna do. I'm somewhat nervous. I think it'll probably be best if I just drive up there and leave a copy for each, my mom and my dad. Because of the belief system, they can feel like they failed. My parents are good people but the religion teaches that if you're not active in the church, then those things don't really matter. I want my parents to know they haven't failed. * While I know that my finances may be affected in the future, especially in Utah, I'm honestly okay with that. Jake's outcome is uncertain but he's willing to take the risk. Faith and fortune brought settlers to Salt Lake City, and the town's love of God and desire for money have woven together. Jake tells his parents he's leaving the church. They aren't happy, but they'll support him while he's still in school. I'm not held back by anything anymore. There's no weight hanging over me. I could see myself eventually coming back to Utah but I've got to see the world. New York, California, China, wherever. I've never had any plans for my future. By making it by I don't work myself into tiredness or nothingness. So paying for this house for people to come and enjoy is definitely worth it. * The scene that me and my brother kind of sparked up, you see more people starting their own projects and doing what they wanna do. * I wouldn't say I have any sort of retirement plans but I've thought about what happens post skiing or if my body were just to really fall apart, massive injuries. I'd have to look outside the box and see how I can continue my career in other ways beside just skiing, and continue to pick up sponsors who aren't just in the ski industry. * I really don't think that I would be where I am without the support I had from Kenny. I want to make sure I'm always doing the best I can so that all of the work that he put into me wasn't for nothing. * Salt Lake City is redefining itself and these four people are not only tapping into the change, they are influencing its future. * Just figure out what your priorities are what you really wanna do. For me it's being in the noise hardcore scene in Salt Lake City. Thanks everyone for coming out.
