Guess who? I'm sorry, Mr. Hancock, I'll have it ready by sundown. They'll see us! Stop! Annie? Annie? Hey, Ben. Hey, Joe. Did you feed the horses this morning? No, no... Annie? Annie Hancock, where are you? Right here. There's my little girl. I'm not really your little girl anymore, dad. No, honey. You'll always be my little girl. You found her. Yeah. Where are the boys? Joe? Ben? I just want to let you know that we made the harvest quota. Just barely, but barely is good enough. Thank you, boys. Good work. Thanks. Annie, you better go get cleaned up. You don't want to be late for the dance. See you later, guys. See you there, boys. I love this song. You're not changing your mind? No. I just don't want to hurt my parents. Annie, we have to leave now. OK, I'll see you outside. Okay. Joe, I need you to do me a favour. Yeah, of course. Anything. I need you to give this to my dad in 30 minutes. I can't believe this. I'm having a Cinderella moment. Annie, with this ring I thee wed. Ben, with this ring I thee wed. I now pronounce you husband and wife. You may kiss the bride. Nobody waits for that anymore. Congratulations. Thank you. I'm sorry, I truly am, but you two are just too young to get married. Dad, you don't understand. You're only 18, Annie. Your mother will be so upset. What about your plans? You haven't even started college. But dad, my future is with Ben. Look, it's not too late, we can get it annulled. Sir, I have a job lined up in New York. It's a big opportunity for me. For us. And they want me there in two days. I want to go with him. I love him. I love your daughter very much, sir. Well then I know you'll want what's best for her. Deep down you know I'm right. Come on, Annie. Get your things. Ben... I understand. Maybe you two just need a little time to think it through. Think more clearly. See the sense in this. I'll send your pay along with the annulment papers. Mr. Hancock... You're a decent kid. I always liked you, Ben. I hope I wasn't wrong about you. You're not wrong about me, sir. One day I hope to prove that to you. Annie! Joe, what is it? You did it again. What? Oops. I'm sorry. I'm sorry! It just feels so weird wearing something so pretty when I'm up to my elbows in farming all day. Look, it matters to me. OK. I'll make you a deal, OK? I won't worry about the ring if we set a date. We will. We will, I promise! It's just, I have so much work to do if I'm gonna get that grant. How am I supposed to revolutionize farming and look for a wedding dress all at the same time? Wear coveralls. I don't care. Hey, we've been engaged for nearly two years. Yeah, but I had graduate school... And then planting and the harvest and taking care of your mother... there's always gonna be something. Hey, we make a good team. OK, let's do it. You mean it? Yeah, yeah! Alright! Alright, one month from today, right after harvest. OK. Fall is my favourite time of year. Annie. Hey. This came for you. This could be about the grant. Fingers crossed. Good news? The foundation just wants some more information about my study. Now don't you use this as an excuse to postpone the wedding. You finally set a date? Right after the harvest. Congratulations. Thank you. Annie. Your father would have been so proud. I know how much he wanted to walk you down the aisle. I know, mom. I miss him every day. We've got a wedding to plan. Yeah. Is everything OK? Yeah. Yeah, of course everything's alright. She's just getting cold feet. No, I'm not. My feet are on fire. I just-I gotta run to the house to grab something. A divorce? This can't be. The marriage was annulled. Anthony McAllister. McAllister. Hi, could I speak to Anthony McAllister? Yeah. OK. No, that's OK. I'll call back. This isn't happening. What's not happening? Where's Joe? He's out in the barn. Why? Come here. So dad filed those annulment papers, didn't he? Of course he did. Well, look what I've got. Divorce? This doesn't make any sense. Yeah, I know. But those papers say I have to appear in a New York City court with Ben the day after tomorrow or I face contempt. Mom, what am I gonna tell Joe? I mean, I never even had a heart to tell him that Ben and I actually got married. He's gonna be so upset. Maybe you've been asked to take a meeting with the foundation. I'm sure it's just a paperwork glitch and... Well, I've gotta go and make a reservation. Well, at least you get to see New York City. Here you go. Thank you. Well, we're not in Iowa anymore. Excuse me. Our wedding is finally coming together, and let me tell you it hasn't been easy. I was appalled by the flower choices that Francois designed for me. I asked for chartreuse and he gave me lime green. And he was offended! On the flip side, you're going to adore my new architect. Poor groom? Excuse me, I'm... I'm so sorry, I didn't see you there. That's quite alright. Is there something I can help you with? Yes, I'm looking for Anthony McAllister. End of the hall, left, first right. Thank you. No need to break the door down, I don't think he's in there. Do you know when he'll be back? No idea. Annie? Ben? I don't know what to say. How about "hello"? Yeah, yeah. Hello. Hi. You look great. Yeah, you too. Thanks. So... I'm looking for your lawyer. Do you work here? Yeah, I do. Well, I... I really need to find out what's going on here. Yeah, why don't we go over here. We can talk and I'll try to get a hold of Tony. OK. Give me this. Thanks. Your boss has a great office. He'll be very pleased to hear you say that. Do you like him? He has his good days and bad days. I think he's liking this one. Voice mail. Tony, it's Ben. Call me asap. So I don't understand what's going on. We have to get a divorce? It's kinda hard to do when you're not married. Did you not get the note? No note, just those very intimidating legal documents. I told Tony to include the note with the documents. Let me explain. Excuse me, Mr. Lawson. You have to leave now for that appointment. I'll be right there, Tracy. Thank you. This is your office? Not bad for a farm hand, Sure beats the barn. Hey! I got your message, I was on my way in. Tony, this is Annie. Nice to meet you. We gotta go. We're expected. I'll update you on the way. Let's go. Annie, sorry, this won't take very long. Where are you staying? I just came from the airport. OK. Tracy? Tracy? Can you please set Miss Hancock up at the corporate suite and have Hector take her? Thank you. That's OK, I'm fine. Annie, I insist. Wait a second. You're the Annie? Annabelle Hancock? That's right. If we're complete by the 26th, should be there in 10 minutes. No, it has to be done by then. Forget the small print. Can you hold please? Hector. Hi. This is Miss Hancock. She's an old friend. Please take good care of her. My apologies, I have to travel with Tony, we're about to finish a deal but I promise when we're done we can talk. Would you mind following me? Yes sir. An hour and a half. He's a busy guy? Yes, miss. He enjoys this larger-than-life life? I don't think he has the time. It's just you and me? That's right. Hector, I drive a tractor. I'm not really a limo kind of gal. Mind if I ride up front with you? It would be my pleasure. OK. Thank you, sir. You're very welcome. What a day. Excuse me, we'll have whatever she's having. Annie, thank you for your patience. We are all yours. Great. Can one of you tell me what's going on with this divorce? 'Cause we're not married. The thing of it is I recently found out that your marriage was never officially annulled. No paperwork exists anywhere. I don't know how it happened, probably got lost in the mail. But it is a problem. It's a big problem, because I'm getting married next month. OK, great. So you both need to get this resolved as soon as possible. Both of us? I'm getting married on Saturday. I thought you knew that. No. I didn't. OK, well anyway, that's why the court date. Technically, in the eyes of the law, you two are husband and wife. This is not good. OK, well surely when the judge hears our story he'll grant a divorce and that will be that, right? Right. Because Joe's going to be crushed if we can't get married next month. You're... you're marrying Joe? My old buddy Joe? Yeah. He's the one. I always knew he had a crush on you. The crush was mutual. I don't know what I would have done without him. Normally when a divorce is filed it takes quite a while to process and become official. I plan to expedite that by arguing special circumstances, but it is crucial that you both show up tomorrow morning to testify. OK. Alright. Well, it's been a long day and I know it's cliche but we farmers get up with the roosters. Not a lot of roosters in the Upper East Side. I'll have Hector take you to the corporate suite. No, it's OK. I can get a hotel. Annie, please. It's the least I can do for dragging you all the way to New York. I'm too tired to argue with you. Thank you. It's OK, the car is just right out here, I'm sure I can find it myself. OK, well, see you in the morning. Don't be late for court! Hello? Hey, mom. Annie, hi! Hey, sorry, I know it's late there. Don't be silly. I've been dying to talk to you. How's New York? How's the little problem? It should be resolved in court tomorrow. Have you seen Ben? How was that? Well, it was... it was strange and awkward. He's a very successful investor. He's changed. Well, it's been such a long time, hon. Considering where things were left off and everything. Yeah. So how's everything there? Yeah. Couldn't be better. Except I miss you. Alright mom, well... I got a big day tomorrow so I'll talk to you later, OK? OK. I'll tell Joe you say hello. Yeah, OK. I love you. Bye. Hello? Yeah. Yeah, I'll be right down. OK. Thanks. Helloooooo! Jovanna? Good morning, my love. I cannot wait to transform this place. It's just not suitable for entertaining. Can we do this later? I gotta get to the office. You don't want your bride moving into something so ordinary. It's just not me. Us. Ours. Wait! I want you to see these plans before I have them finalized. I only have a couple of minutes. That wall is going to come out and everything will be all white with touches of red and black. Clean, modern, bold. I thought we were going with warmer colours. And if you knock down the wall, where are we gonna put my grandmother's antique chest? We'll find the right spot for it. You'll be amazed how much room there is once we get rid of that piano. Wait, I thought that was still up for negotiation? You told me you don't have time to play it anymore. It contradicts my vision. You have to trust me. Interior design isn't just my job, it's my calling. Let me turn our home into a work of art. I want you to be happy. Whatever you need to make that happen, go ahead. I have to go. I'll see you later for dinner? That new French place on Madison. Maybe we could eat in sometime? Duck ? l'Orange, take out. Yeah. See ya. Thank you. Morning, Hector. I got you a little surprise. Why, thank you, Annie. May I call you Annie? What else would you call me? Thoughtful, considerate. That works. It's a very elegant apartment. It's a little cold for my taste, but... I trust you slept well. I got up at dawn. I can't help it, you know? It's just in my genes. Plus all the honking and the sirens... we don't have a lot of that in Iowa. I gotta be honest with you, Hector. I didn't sleep a wink. I was pretty nervous about today. May I ask you a question? Of course, ask away. How long have you worked for Ben? Since he was a junior executive, and there was always something special about him. He was polite, he was friendly, he was completely different from the privileged young men who were his competition. He worked harder than anyone else. It was like he was chasing a dream. Looks like he finally fulfilled that dream. I just wish he was happier. Are you alright? Yeah, just ready to move forward. OK. All rise. Mr. McAllister. Back in my courtroom so soon? Yes, your honor. But I was told Judge Norton was going to be presiding. He had an emergency. You're stuck with me. Well, this shouldn't take up too much of your time. Let's hope not. Proceed. 15 years ago, Benjamin Lawson and Annabelle Hancock were married. That marriage was annulled or so we thought. Why the confusion? The annulment papers were sent in, but there's no record of them ever being finalized. I discovered this fact while writing his pre-nup. Mr. Lawson needs to be legally divorced as soon as possible. He's getting married Saturday. This Saturday? Yes, your honor. So I'm citing special circumstances and asking that you grant them an immediate divorce. You realize what would happen if I obliged every attorney with the same request? I need to hear from the couple. How did this occur? Miss Hancock and I eloped but her father felt we were too young. How young? Annie was 18, I was 19. Both of legal age. Why did you agree? I didn't want the annulment. We were very much in love, but I did what I felt was best for Annie and reluctantly signed the papers. And then what? That's all I know. And then Mr. McAllister discovered the problem. This was the last time you two saw each other? We haven't spoken in 15 years. Once I left Iowa she stopped all communication. What? You're the one that got on that bus and never looked back. Your honor, Mr. Lawson is simply asking for the ability to get married as scheduled on Saturday. I got the message loud and clear when you didn't show up at the bus stop. Mr. McAllister, a little order in the court. I'm sorry... I had a really good reason, not that you cared. You never even bothered to find out why I didn't show. I waited as long as I could. I wrote letters. I called. He never called. Why are you lying? I mean, none of this even matters anymore. Your honor, I'm not lying. I just want to get this over with. Annie, Annie, no... What is going on, counselor? Ben! Ben! I'm going to review these special circumstances and take them under advisement. You and your unruly clients will be back in my courtroom Monday morning 10am. Your honor, Monday is too late. This court is adjourned. Your honor! Mr. Lawson is going to be married Saturday! That is not my problem. No, I realize that. It's-it's that would be my problem. OK. Annie. I got on that bus because you never showed up. Not even to say goodbye. 'Cause dad had a heart attack that day. It was the first of many and I couldn't leave him and I couldn't leave my mom. I am so sorry. I had no idea. He was just never the same after that. This proud man suddenly couldn't do much of anything. Why didn't you answer my letters? Or return my calls? 'Cause I never got any letters. You tried to contact me? You honestly had no idea? Dad. He was just trying to protect you. He should have told me. Psst. Guys. What hap... What hap... Ben? Hi. What-what are you doing here? I stopped by your office after seeing the architect. Guess what? You weren't there. So I looked at your calendar and it said "court". Nothing about a pretty girl. This isn't a pretty girl. I think she could pass for pretty. No. Annie is my client. She and Ben are old friends. He asked me to help her out of a jam. Am I missing something? A deposition. I'll take care of it later. We haven't been introduced. I'm Ben's fianc?, Jovanna Jorgensen. Annie Hancock. We go way back. To Iowa. Our time on the farm together. It's Annie's first time to the city. Yeah. How long will you be in town? Our court date got postponed until Monday. Monday?! Yes. Well, enjoy the big city. I will see you later, my love? I'm having lunch with a client. Jovanna is an interior designer. Lovely to have met you. You too. We're getting married on Saturday. Why can't we come back sooner? We have four days to fix this. The judge's docket is full and you two walking out of the courtroom didn't help the case! So what are we gonna do? I got a plan. You'll get married as scheduled. Jovanna will sign a faux marriage certificate, although you won't be legally married until I get the judge to wave her magic gavel on Monday, but I'll switch the papers, no one will know the difference. I don't know, Tony. Ben, I'm going to shuffle around some papers, OK? Jovanna shouldn't have to cancel the fairytale wedding, it is the social event of the season. What do you think, Annie? I think I need to get back home. Ben, I have so much going on. You can't get married until this is resolved. The judge insisted that we all be present Monday. What difference does a few days make, right? OK. Alright, but I have to get some work done because I'm doing a thesis on the acidity of soil. That sounds exciting. You can have an office, a computer, whatever you need. You can have an office and a computer, whatever you need. Maybe a plant. You're at home. Let's go to lunch. I'm starving. Come on, Ben. According to our analyst the whole sector is hot. Hi. Tracy said you wanted to see me? Yes. We don't usually have an in-house farmer down the hall. I want to buy King Fertilizer Corp. We have to move fast because it is poised for a big bump. I don't know anything about stocks. But? I do know fertilizer, and that brand is lacking in minerals and it just depletes the soil over time. But our team has done reams of research and... My degree is in agricultural chemistry with an emphasis on biotechnology. No disrespect, but I think that King Fertilizer is a bad bet. OK. It was your idea to ask her. Is that it? Yes. That's it, thanks. Funny. Real funny. Annie! Good call. King is down by $6. You saved us a lot of money. Yeah, it was my idea to ask her. Great. Yes, it is. And because of that we owe you a first class New York City dinner tonight, I'm buying. That's not necessary. Jovanna and I already have plans. Great, why don't we all go? Perfect. See you tonight. Congratulations. And it is lucky for me you got that degree. Cheers. Cheers. What kind of degree? I'm a doctoral candidate. That's a lot of education for running a farm. Well, running a farm is hard work. Ben and I used to hear my dad say that all the time. I have some good news. We have a final head count for our wedding. Only 406. I thought you said 350. It's the social event of the season. 406 people? That's more than the whole population of Granby. It'd be like Joe and me inviting the whole town to our wedding. You're getting married? Didn't I tell you that? No, Ben. You left that part out. When's the wedding, Annie? It's like four weeks from today. I don't even have a dress. Seriously? I scoured every inch of this city to find the perfect wedding dress. I know just where to take you. Jovanna, I'm sure you have enough on your plate with our wedding. I can spare a few hours for your old friend. You can tell me all about young Ben and his idyllic days on the farm. No, I couldn't possibly impose. Come by my office tomorrow morning. I'll take you shopping. Just us girls. It'll be fun. Great. Hey, Joe. Hey, Annie. How are you doing? I'm OK. How's everything there? The tractor is running a little sluggish but I'll have Ed have a look at it. You know, your mom and I sent out the save the date wedding invitations. That's great. When do you think you'll be back? I should know a little bit more on Monday. You know, it's not the same around here without you. Hey, your mom's here. I'll put you on speaker. OK. Annie, honey, we miss you. Hey, mom. Miss you, too. Listen guys, I gotta get going but I'll call you tomorrow, OK? OK hon, good luck. Alright, bye. Bye. Tell Francois he's color blind. The roses he showed me are fuchsia. And I don't like the chairs in the banquet hall. Tell Sergio to replace them. Yes, I do realize it's 430 chairs and yes, by Saturday. Thank you. She needs something much simpler. There's too much tulle. It's very pretty, though. You'll know when it's the one. Let's try the ivory A-line. Look, Jovanna, I really appreciate your help with this but I'm just feeling a little bit overwhelmed. Maybe I should look for something back in Granby. Not on my watch. Iowa isn't exactly the fashion capital of the world. You're not leaving New York City without a wedding dress. Now you march right back into that dressing room. You only get married once, right? Right. Right. It all starts with the dress. It dictates the feeling, the theme of the entire wedding. I guess. So tell me all about the groom. How did you guys meet, how long have you been together? Joe, he's... Joe is a solid guy, he's been our right hand at the farm ever since, well, forever. It kinda feels like we grew up together. I can't believe you run a farm. After my dad died I had to. But I couldn't do it without my mom and Joe. He's... He's a really loyal guy. That's what I love most about Ben. How honest and loyal he is. You know what I mean? Yep. How are you doing in there? No. No. That's the one! Once they make the adjustments we'll have it sent right over. Joe is a very lucky man. Thank you. I think Walker is playing us. Hello? Earth to Ben. Sorry. Walker. I was just thinking about Jovanna and Annie. Wondering how things are going. That's why you're so distracted. Yeah, my future wife is helping my other wife pick out a wedding gown so she can get married to a guy who has no idea she was ever married to me. What a tangled web we weave. I'm counting on you to un-weave it on Monday. What am I, new? I got it. Relax. It's going to be fun. Annie, hey. We were we were just talking about you. How's the shopping expedition going? I got a dress. That's great. Yeah, Jovanna was determined to find the perfect one, and we did. So everything was OK? Yeah, Ben, she's great. I just feel badly about deceiving her about you and me and Tony's whole faux license scheme. I know what you mean, but soon it'll all be resolved and there will be no more secrets to keep. Yeah. She's really excited about the wedding. Jovanna! Hello, my love. Do you mind if I call you back? My fianc? just walked in. Yeah. Yeah. Fashionista farmer. I'll have to surprise you more often. What brought that on? Can't a guy kiss his bride to be? Later, lovebirds. I got work to do. Thank you for going the extra mile with Annie. Just another wonderful thing you do. How did it go? We found the perfect dress. And I learned a few things about her, too. Like what? This and that. Just girl talk. But that's not why I came by. That remodel I did in Chicago just snagged the cover of By Design magazine, along with an eight-page spread! That's great! The only problem is it's not absolutely perfect yet. You know how I am about details. So I'm on the next plane to Chicago. I'll be back in time for the rehearsal, I hope you don't mind. Of course not. Annie! What are you doing here? Ben was kind enough to lend me an office so I can get some work done. Hey. Listen. I just, I really want to say thank you for helping me find that dress. I'm excited. It was my pleasure, honestly. Wait! I just had a great idea. Since you're stuck here anyway, why don't you come to the rehearsal? And the wedding? What? No... Nonsense. You and Ben are such old friends, I know he'd want you there. I... don't know what to say. Say yes. I gotta run. See you at the rehearsal. OK. Are you OK? I'm coming to your wedding. What did you say? Hey. You just missed your shopping BFF. No, I didn't. I didn't miss her and she didn't miss me. In fact, she insisted that I come to the rehearsal and the wedding. You don't have to do that. But she's been so nice, I couldn't refuse. You know, it's gonna be strange, but I'll be fine. You're a real trooper. Piece of cake. Literally. Seven layers and counting. Maybe you shouldn't go to the wedding. I'll be fine. Let me make it up to you. Jovanna has to go to Chicago so I'm off wedding duty for a couple of days. How about after work I show you some of my New York? Yeah, yeah. Take her out to dinner, celebrate the divorce. You've barely seen the city. It's crazy to come to the big apple and not take a bite. You may not get this chance again. OK. OK. Hector, allow me. Let's do some touring, shall we? As you wish. This is great. There's so many people here. You should have been a tour guide. Well, we've only covered Manhattan. We've got four more boroughs. I wish we had that kind of time. Me too. So how do you know about this place? Well, when I first got here it was pretty overwhelming so I'd find tiny, low-key places like this so I wouldn't feel like such a stranger. It looks like you fit in now. I'm just a country boy in a designer suit. And a chauffeur and over 400 people coming to your wedding! You know, why don't we go uptown? I'll show you Fifth Avenue, and then we have dinner reservations. Can I be honest with you? Fire away. I really appreciate you showing me all the wonderful things that New York has to offer but you don't have to impress me. I'm not trying to impress you. Well, maybe a little bit. But it's only because the life I'm living right now is what I always dreamed of... for us. OK, you tell me. Where do you want to go? How about somewhere where I won't feel like a fool for using the wrong fork? I know a perfect spot. No forks required. Come on, let's go. OK. Where to? Hector, let's go to Brooklyn. Yes, sir. I'm afraid we may be lost. We're not lost. I used to live around here. Fourth story walk-up, no hot water. It was all I could afford. See now this is my favourite part of the tour. I wanted to see your New York. Let's go check it out. Hector, why don't you grab something to eat? I'll catch up with you later. As you wish. Walk with me? Sure. So this is the first place that I landed after I arrived. Yeah? Yeah. I loved it. My landlady, Mrs. Pederson, gave me a break on my rent, said she believed in me. Thought I had a future. How right she was? So how did you get you from a four story walk-up to a penthouse? Luck. And a little bit of talent. Actually, it started with your dad. He used to have trouble with his books and I'd help him out. You helped my dad? I mean, he knew his stuff, he just wasn't great at putting it on paper and bottom line thinking came easy to me. So you... you get to New York, and then what? I kinda became a gopher for a Wall Street trader and he noticed I had a knack for it and he became my mentor. I'm pretty lucky. I love what I do, but I work so much that sometimes I forget to slow down. Still hungry? As long as it's nothing fancy. See for yourself. I love pizza. Yeah? Yeah. Can we get two cheese please? You just wait. It's the best? My absolute favourite. Your favourite? OK. Hands down. Thank you. Thank you. There you go. Yum. So this is the best pizza you will ever have. Really? I promise. OK. Woah, woah, wait. This is how we do it in Brooklyn. OK, you gotta bend it. Alright. Yeah, that's good. That is good. Right? Mmmhmm. Yeah. You got a little... What? It's all over me, isn't it? I mean, you know it's great pizza when you start wearing it. And no forks required. So have you ever brought Jovanna here? This isn't really her style. Are you kidding me? In the middle of Brooklyn? This is my favourite part of town. You want a soda? Yeah, I would love a soda. Thanks. Can I get two sodas please? That was the best pizza in the world. Sometimes it's good to remember where you came from. I haven't been up this late in ages. I think this is the most beautiful place in the whole city. You know, it's crazy 'cause I always thought New York City was just a bunch of big buildings. This park always reminded me of Iowa. Yeah. I can't get over how big this city feels. And if you think about it, it's really small in land acres. Always thinking like a farmer. That was meant to be a compliment. Mmmhmm. Yeah, I can see why you thrived here. Granby is just too small for you. It had its advantages. Ben, this has been... it's kinda been perfect, these past two days. Yeah, it has. How about dinner tonight? Hi. Come in. You look beautiful. Just a country girl in a designer dress. Touch?. Ben, this is amazing. I really wanted you to see it. It took me a lot of years to get here. You like it? Do I like it? Yeah! Yeah. What's not to like? Well, Jovanna wants to redecorate. She wants a cleaner, modern look. I don't know. I kinda like it the way it is. Make yourself at home. I'll get us something to drink. Alright. Sorry, the piano... Please, don't stop. It's probably the last time it'll get played, anyway. Jovanna wants to get rid of it. Why? Well, I never have any time to play and it's not in keeping with her vision. Maybe her vision needs some revision. Come on, I'll show you the terrace. OK. Thank you. I always loved to hear you play. I'd go out on the back porch and close my eyes, get carried away. That's why daddy was always looking for you. Ben! Hey, let's... let's toast to something. OK. Here's to our divorce. To our divorce. Ben, this is... this is incredible. Yeah, it is. So you're getting your PhD in agricultural chemistry? Yeah, yeah. Well, to gain credibility. I'm trying to do this study that could eliminate the need for pesticides. Ambitious. Yeah, I know. That's why it's so hard to get that grant. What I'm doing is I'm taking generations of corn and planting them in very alkaline soil. I'm breeding for pest resistance and... and then I'm taking herbs that are natural deterrents and I'm placing them on the periphery of the land and that eliminates the need for chemical pesticides. That's beautiful. You know, I'm pretty good at writing checks. Maybe I could help. No, no, no. I don't think that would sit well with Joe. Or me, you know. I kinda have to do this on my own. Don't worry, though. I'll get my grant. You know, I envy you. Why? Your passion. You're doing something meaningful. Well I think you're doing OK here, Ben. All I do is buy and sell things. At the end of the day it seems hollow somehow. Sometimes I wonder what would have happened if I stayed in Iowa. Ben, don't go there. Found out a broken heart is a great motivator. I'm just glad you're back in my life because you remind me of who I really am. Or want to be. I feel like I sacrificed that to obtain all this. Ben. I'm not back in your life. You have Jovanna and I have Joe and as soon as this divorce is granted then we need to move on. Maybe. We... Are both marrying other people. We've chosen our lives. This can't happen... Ben, I'm sorry. Annie! Annie! Thank you for a lovely evening. I had a wonderful day. Annie. Thank you. Annie! Annie, wait. Let me drive you. It's OK, Hector. I'm fine. Please, come on. Come. Do you care to talk? This is just all so strange. I'm guessing you know our story by now. Yeah. Ben tends to confide in me. It must be a very confusing time for both of you. Yeah, that's the thing. It's not supposed to be confusing. I'm marrying Joe, he's marrying Jovanna. End of story. Except seeing each other has stirred up some old feelings. Yeah. Very old. I mean, Ben and I loved each other. But that was once upon a time and all of this is just pining for what might have been. I see. I don't know, I think I should just go home. This whole charade has just gotten too difficult. Do you mind some advice? Go ahead. Do you care about Ben and his future happiness? Yeah. I do. You see, this charade, it's also for your future happiness. You know, as difficult as it may be I think you should just stick with the plan. Just stay till Monday. I guess. Everything will work out just as it's supposed to. My dad always said that. Annie Hancock, I'm glad you're staying. No, no, no. I got this. Hector, you're my best friend in New York, you know that? Good night. Good night. Don't lose that girl, Ben. Hey, I've been calling you all day. I thought you went back to Granby. No, I stayed. For everybody's sake. Hector said you two talked. Is everything OK? Yeah, yeah. I'm fine. As far as I'm concerned, Monday can't come fast enough though. Look, I get it but I still think we need to talk about what happened. Nothing happened. It's not going to, so we don't really need to talk about anything. Annie! There you are. Benny, Benny. How was Chicago? You're so sweet to ask. It was my first magazine cover so thankfully everything went perfectly. Great. You look beautiful. If everyone could take their places, please. That's my cue. OK. Ladies, if you would assemble at the foot of the aisle. Gentlemen, if you would stand to my left. And proceed once you're ready. Now, tomorrow when all the guests are here at this point everyone will stand as the bride enters. And as the bride and her father approach, he gives her away. And Ben if you take Jovanna's hand and face each other. And here I'll say a few words about the happy couple. At which point where you exchange your vows... Finally I will pronounce you husband and wife. Hey, Joe. Hey, listen Annie, I've got bad news. There's a really big storm heading our way. How bad is it? Well, if the river rises we could lose the crops. OK, well, I'll just... I'll be home as soon as I can. Yeah, OK. Annie, everything OK? Yeah, there's a big storm coming, the crops are in danger of flooding so I have to go home. What about Monday? I don't know. I don't know. Tony will figure out something. All of the corn crops in my study, they could be gone. I mean, everything that I worked so hard for. What about your wedding? I'm just going to have to try to make Joe understand and hopefully he'll forgive me for lying. Just have Tony send me the papers whenever they're settled. Goodbye, Ben. Annie... Just, please, don't. The runaway groom. What happened to you two? Where's Annie running off to? Is everything alright? No, Jovanna, it's not. You and I need to talk. Thank you. Morning. Morning. It's a beautiful sunrise, isn't it, honey? Yeah, that was quite the storm. I think we saved most of the crops though. We still haven't talked about what happened. That's because nothing happened. Just a bunch of reminiscing. Well, anytime you want to talk about nothing happened, I'm always here for you. Thanks, mom. Any news? No. Community is taking too long to deliberate. I don't think I'm gonna get my grant. Well, you've gotta hang in there, honey. I'm just trying to do some good, you know? You have done plenty of good. You've kept this farm from going under. Mom, we're barely making our quota. Did you know that your dad almost lost this farm twice? What? He wasn't good at handling the pressure or the money. He always wanted to work the land, not the books. Ben was a big help. You knew about that? He didn't know that I knew. I kept it that way. Your dad was a proud man. I always thought he was so in control. Girls always like to think of their daddy that way. Yeah. Well, I gotta get to work. Don't worry, everything's gonna work out. As it's supposed to. I know. Like dad always said. Any other rabbits to pull out of your hat? I'm working on it. Good morning, your honor. Where is Miss Hancock? I specifically asked that both of your clients be here this morning. Well, your honor, it's complicated. Your honor, Miss Hancock had to go back to Iowa for an emergency. If I could just plead our case. I'm not planning on getting married anytime soon, but I'm begging the court to expedite the divorce so Annie can marry her fianc?. She deserves to be happy. Regardless of your heartfelt plea on her behalf, I'm afraid I can't grant a divorce at this time without hearing from the other party. Next case. Your honor... I've already ruled. We're done. It was a nice speech. I almost believed it. I want Annie to be happy. I believe that part. Just not about marrying Joe. Hey. Hey. The stars are so bright tonight. Nice and clear after the storm. Annie, I... I got something I'd like to say. But first off I'm so glad you're back. You could have told me you and Ben were married all those years ago. I'm sorry. I just-I didn't know how. I want you to know I don't mind waiting for the divorce to come through. I'm just glad that we're back in sync again. You and I, we're like a well-oiled machine, you know? You know what I mean? Not really. We plant, we harvest, we get the job done. Look Joe... I don't want to be part of a well-oiled machine. It's just a turn-of-phrase, Annie. I really appreciate everything you've done for me over the years, but that, that's gratitude. That's the kind of love you have towards a friend, not the kind of love you build a marriage on. Like you and Ben. You know, I can't compete with a ghost, Annie. It's not about me and Ben. You sure about that? Maybe. I don't know. It doesn't matter, he's with Jovanna now. Joe... this, this is about you and me. Well, I guess a two-year engagement should have given me a clue. Where are you going? I have no idea. Don't you dare go out of my life. I can't. There's too much work to do. That's a lovely piece. I was just wrestling with a few things. Have you spoken with her? Jovanna will never speak to me again. I embarrassed her. She wants nothing to do with me. I meant Annie. I've picked up the phone a dozen times, but what would I say? She's made it very clear that she wants the past to stay in the past. I have a confession to make, sir. I grew very fond of Annie when she was here so I've checked in a few times. Is she alright? What did she say? She's in a bit of a bind. She didn't get her funding. She must be devastated. Perhaps. She's a resilient woman. However, I thought that it might present an opportunity. I've offered her money, she turned me down. I've never known you to take no for an answer. I don't want to insult her. I'm sure you'll find a graceful way to part with your money. Maybe so. Hector, where would I be without you? Stuck in your penthouse when you should be in Iowa. Mud. What a way to lose a grant. How're you doing? Hey. I'm fine. Nothing a little moody walk in the field can't fix. I'm so sorry, Annie. It's OK. They were worried that the flood might compromise my study but I don't know, I just think it still worked. You did your best. I'm proud of you. Thanks. I'm sorry about you and Joe. He seems to be doing OK. I hope so. I think you did the right thing. You just didn't have that spark. Or whatever it was your dad and I had. It's times like this when I miss him the most. Yeah. Me too, mom. Me too. Let's hope for a great harvest tomorrow. Annie? Yeah. Annie? Yeah. Everyone's here to start the harvest. You alright? Yeah. Fine. Shoes. See you downstairs. OK. Sir, I've got the numbers on that deal. Should we move on this before the close? Tracy, I'm running late. You decide. Sir? Where's he going in such a rush? I have no idea. I just got an update, flight's right on schedule. You're sure you want me to come with you? I wouldn't have it any other way. This'll be quite an adventure for me, I've never visited the mid-west. You're gonna love it. If Annie's any indication, I'm certain I will. They say you never go home again, but here I go. Twelve hour day? Thanks so much for your hard work. Alright everybody, so it is my pleasure to tell you that even with the flooded fields we made our quota! Whooo! Thank you so much, guys. So go out tonight, go to the harvest festival, have a good time. Y'all earned it, alright? There's some water right over there by the barn if you guys want it. Thank you. Thank you. It was a tough one. You did it again. We did it again. You better go get cleaned up. Do your hair and all that fun stuff. I was thinking of wearing my pink dress. Mom, I'm not gonna go to the harvest festival. It's always been your favourite night of the year. I know, but I just can't really see myself dancing right now. I know things have been tough lately, but trust me. Dancing is exactly what you need. McAllister. Yeah. Really? So it's official? Thank you. Yes! I rock! Tracy, find Ben! It's urgent, urgent good. He is gonna be happy. I'm glad you came, Annie. Dancing is fun. I know. Come on. Annie, come on. Let's have some fun. Come on. Look, it's Marla, hi. Hey. So nice to see you. Are you having fun? Good to see you. Well, well... Welcome to Granby. Are you kidding me? Nice to see you, too. What are you doing here, Ben? No, you know what? I don't even care. You know what I wanna do? I want to pop you in the mouth. But I won't, because I want Annie to be happy. What do you mean? Wait, you don't know? What? We broke up. Joe, I'm sorry. No, no you're not. I'd say we arrived right on time. Going to be fun. Excuse me, do you know that song, "Forever Love"? Would you mind playing it? What are you doing here? Dancing with the love of my life. What about Jovanna? We broke up. Joe and I... we... I know. Hi. Hi. Hey, Joe. Hey, Mary-Jane. Lou. Mary-Lou. You look nice. When Annie's all out of your system, look me up. Can we talk outside? Why didn't you call? You were with Joe. Well then why did you come? I heard you didn't get the grant. I wanted to give you the money. Ben, I don't need saving. Maybe I do. I'm tired of buying and selling and padding my own pocket. I want to do something that matters. It's a grant. From the "I believe in you" foundation. You can pay me back after you save the world. Every penny. Ben! How did you find me? Tracy tracked you down. I finally got the judge to sign off. You two sign on the dotted line and you are officially divorced and free to marry whomever whenever you want. What-what're you doing? Sorry. What did I miss? Miss Annie Hancock, will you marry me again? Yes! Yes! I guess I missed a lot. True love never dies. Sometimes it just takes a 15-year detour. Annie, with this ring I thee wed. Ben, with this ring I thee wed. I now pronounce you husband and wife. You may now kiss the bride.
