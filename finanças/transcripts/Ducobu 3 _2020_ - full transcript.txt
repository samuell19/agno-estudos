He knocks on the door. ... - It's okay, I heard you! Did you fall out of bed? - I missed you. - Did you have a bad vacation? - No, but two months on the pill, that's five minutes. You look superb, Mr. Director. - Phew! - I would say you've become younger. Looks like a vigorous young bamboo. - Do not start your sycophancy. I haven't slept for 2 months and lost 10 kilos. -It emanates from you a joy of living. - What emerges from me is my wife. She left with a surfer. - Oh... Consternation. - Keep it to yourself. You will need it. I have very bad news for you. - Is the start of the school year postponed? Playful music ... - Where are we going ? Are we going back on vacation? - Hey no. I'll take you to school. - Oh ! Ooh! - Oh well then! - What is he doing? Oh, son! Come back here ! Come back ! - I hope you have charged the batteries well. You will need it. - You are beautiful, my lion of the Alps. Little laugh - Miss Rateau, please keep decent behavior. We are not in Romeo and Juliet. - The director is right. Here, it is the school of knowledge. And not vice! - Please excuse me. It will not happen again. - I hope, my nightingale. Let's keep the limits ... - Don't overdo it either. Good. I'll get right to the point. - Direct and precise. - But you are going to complete it, Latouche! Where was I? Ah yes, there you go. The budgets allocated to the renovation of the school are blocked. Sighs As a result, the leaky roof will not be repaired, just like the radiators defective and the staircase shaking. Protests This is not the worst. To meet urgent expenses, I had to sell on Leboncoin sports equipment, instruments ... - My flutes? - Don't look like that. You can blackmail them. The voice is a beautiful instrument. - Approbation ! Yeah. The bell rings. Playful music - Karine ! - Leonie! ... - How I missed you so much! - It's clear! - Oh... Did you have a good vacation? - It's clear. - Me too. I had too much fun with Ducobu. Apart from one thing that gets me drunk: our parents go out together. They think we don't know. - It's not clear. - But the worst part is that if they get married, Ducobu will become my half-brother. We won't be able to love each other anymore. - It's clear! But Ducobu told you he loved you? - No, he doesn't dare tell me. It's still a boy. But I know he loves me. - It's clear. -He even promised me to mature. - It's not clear. - He said he was going to work and that he would not cheat again. - Non! I don't want to go back to school! I want to go back on vacation! - Ah! I see you are in an excellent state of mind, Ducobu. That's good. I'm motivated. The reed bends, but never breaks. Go about your business, Mr. Ducobu. I'll take care of your toddler, trust me. Have a great day. - Thank you, Mr. Latouche. Come on. Works well. - Hi Dad. Strident voice - Everyone in line! Terracotta breakage - Ah! Hello. - Hello. What's wrong ? - I prefer that we remain discreet. I wouldn't want to disturb the children when they are back to school. - Okay, but we'll have to tell them. - Yes one day. Brouhaha - Silence ! I don't want to hear a fly fly! A fly is buzzing. ... Moans of disgust It is a pivotal year for Saint-Potache. We have the choice between succeeding or succeeding! I chose the 2nd choice. But also the first. Do not mistake yourself. It's my choice ! - Hair on the finger. Laughs - Last year, I was lax. From now on, I will be uncompromising! - Hair to the teeth! Laughs - Do you like hairy hair, Ducobu? You're going to have some. In class ! Alarm Go! Go! Go ! You settle down. Calm music ... Intriguing music ... - Hi, new one. You didn't know, but ... you're in my shoes. - Whoever goes hunting loses his place. - I won it by the sweat of my brow. - Do you have any proof? - Yes. It is I who engraved these bars. I remained a prisoner 217 days at this place. - Hm ... You're lucky then, I'll let you go. - This is the place of the dunce. ... And I'm the biggest dunce the school has ever known. - Maybe you were, but it's over. I take your place. - Ducobu! I want you sitting here! - Oh no ! Not the place of the fayot! - Don't argue! I won't let go. I'll mark you in the panties. - You promised me you would be serious. - Did I say that? Pff! It had to be another Ducobu. - Silence ! Good ! We are fortunate to have two new arrivals. Théo, Georges, Vincent? What is this gibberish? You don't have a last name? - Uh ... yes, yes. Hum... Théo-Georges, that's my first name. Vincent, my name. You can call me TGV. - Pardon ? - I was called that because my mother gave birth in 58 minutes and 45 seconds. Faster than Paris-Lille. Laughs - Phew! Nia, nia, nia. - Shut up ! Good ! We'll see if you're as good at geography as you are at humor. Kuala Lumpur is the capital of which country? Beep (-Kuala Lumpur is the capital of which country?)

Something horrible is happening to me. - Horrible? Did they remove the canteen? - Worst. A new one challenges me to cheat. He says it's the best. I want to reduce it to mush. I need the best of the best of cheating. - I have everything you need, kid. So... I can offer you the Grugex handkerchiefs. The top of the snack, as the name suggests. Ah!

Ça n'empêche pas ta mère de craquer sur un Ducobu. - C'est ton père qui craque. Il fait tout ce qu'elle lui dit comme un chien. - Pff. Tu rigoles ? Y a pas de risques. C'est pas le style de mon père. C'est en attendant de trouver la femme de sa vie, mais son style de meuf, c'est plus les fashionistas stylées. Kim Kardashian ou Lady Gaga. Pas des ringardes. - Ton père n'est pas non plus le style de ma mère. Son genre d'homme, c'est les mecs stylés et musclés comme les rappeurs. Pas les vieux maigrichons ! (-Nia, nia, nia.) Pff !

Il est beau gosse, intelligent, rigolo... Comme toi, maman. Petit rire - C'est gentil, ma chérie. - C'est juste dommage que... - Que quoi ? - Que tu sois pas son style de femme. - Ah bon ? Pourquoi ça ? - C'est Ducobu qui me l'a dit. Il aime les fashionistas bling-bling et sexy. - Les "fastanichas" euh... bling-bling et sexy ? - Genre Kardashian ou Lady Gaga. - Ah bon ? Je trouve ça bizarre. - Oui, oui. -"Fastonistaches"... ... - La mère de Léonie est bizarre, non ? - Pourquoi tu dis ça ? Elle est charmante. - C'est bizarre qu'à son âge, elle kiffe que les rappeurs musclés. - Comment ça, les rappeurs musclés ? - C'est Léonie qui me l'a dit. - C'est étonnant. Adeline... Enfin, Mme Gratin m'a jamais parlé de rappeurs musclés. - Elle est comme sa fille. Elle se la pète et elle pense qu'au physique.
