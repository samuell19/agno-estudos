I ain't got no quarrel with you, Brown! Yeah, well, I'm the one you're gonna have to go to, that's what you got- - Oh, is that right? Yeah! - Oh, come on, Chris, it's me he wants! - Yeah, 'cause you're a sure bet! You want him, Billy? Come and get it! - Oh, man! - Come on, Chris! - Let's go! This is the last time I help you out, man. It's the last time. - I'm sorry, Chris.

Well, you know, I'll tell you the truth, I have not made up my mind yet. And I still haven't talked to your mother. You know what she's gonna say! - Well, you know, your mother has certain expectations of you, son. - I'm not goin' to college! You know that, I know that. - Then maybe you'd better tell me. What happened? - Uh, Billy Barstow. - Again? Jack, I want you to call his parents! - Mom! This has gone on long enough! - You know what my life would be like if you talk to his parents! - He's right. - Dad, will you tell her? Tell her. - Um, you know, Chris went down to the Marine Corps Recruiting Office yesterday. And he got a consent form there for me to sign. - To do what? - I want outta here, Mama. I went down there and I talked to 'em and they said that they got these programs that I could join. - But that doesn't make any sense! You're 17 years old! You're still in high school! - Well, he can get a high school equivalency in the Marine Corps. - Honey, this is your home. You have your friends here. Family! - Mom, I don't wanna grow up bein' one of the good ol' boys! This town has nothing to offer but more Billy Barstows! And I'm gonna end up drivin' back and forth through this damn valley on my way to nowhere! I'm sorry, Mama. This is somethin' I've gotta do. - He's throwin' away his future! - You think his future is a doctor or a lawyer? Honey, our son is just an average youngster. No more, no less. - He had a future! - And he still does. Marine Corps will give him a chance to grow up, find out about himself then he can create his own future. - He can't go if you don't sign that paper! - And he will resent us for it and join up anyway, as soon as he turns 18. - He has everything he needs here! - Maybe that's the problem. He's a young man, Mary. Young men need to be let go of. He wants his freedom and I understand that. - Wantin' your freedom is one thing, knowin' what to do with it is somethin' else again. I've never stood in your way. - I never said you did. - There you go, go easy! Go easy, there he is! There he is, there he is! You got him! Okay! Mama, look at him! - Chris! That is the biggest fish I have ever seen! - He caught it all by himself! Oh, baby! - Well, doctor! - I am so proud of you! He's a beautiful- Now, Jack, I don't want- Jack! Come here, baby! Look at that fish! Jack! - Isn't he a beauty? Look at that! My, my, my, my, my! - Looks like this is it. Mama. I'm, I'm really sorry if I've been a disappointment to you. - Hush now! You're our very special boy! And you have always made me proud. - It's not like it's forever. Well, in a way it is, you know! I suppose you'd have to have a child of your own to understand that. You just remember how much I love you! And that you have a home here! Always! - Daddy's waitin'. One, two, three four. Up over your head! - Happy birthday, Brown! Your mama sent you a cake! It was delicious. Tell her thanks. - Come on, Junior. We got better treats waitin' for you. Listen and learn, Junior. Ma'am, I know just how you feel. - How's that? - Well, after a long day's march, my feet are just beggin' for a little tender lovin' care. And I bet that after your shift tonight, we can make ourselves feel a whole lot better. - I just love a man in uniform! So I'll tell you what. You keep yours on and I won't report you to your principal! That'll be $3.50. Keep the change. But you are cute. - I'm cute. - Yeah, you are cute. Thanks for the lesson! Don't look now but I'm gettin' some attention. What're you lookin' for, stop lookin'! C'mon, Vince, don't look at her. Oh gosh, she's comin' this way. - Hi. I'm Vince. Chris, stand up. - Oh. Yeah. - I'm Charlene. My friends call me Dusty. I'm Chris. - Would you like to ask me to dance, Chris? - Me? - Mm-hm. - Sure. - You lead. - Okay. - Careful.

You gotta push him, daughter! - Oh, my God. He's here! Mama, go get Jack! He's here! He's here! For heaven's sake, why is he knockin'? - Hi, Mama. I'd like you to meet my wife. Dusty. - Hi. - She's very attractive. - Sure. I can't take her anywhere without all the guys starin' at her. - And you like that? Mary. - Just asking. - So, why didn't you call or at least write or somethin'? - I know, I'm sorry about that. It's just, it happened so fast! Isn't she a little old for you? Who is she, where'd she come from, who's her family? - Mary, it's done. We may not be happy about it right now but she seems like a nice enough young lady and I think we owe it to Chris to welcome her into our family. Excuse me. - Thanks, Dad. Mama. - I'll try. I'm just a little shell-shocked. Hey, Chris! - Chris! Supper is ready if you're so inclined! - Now, when you take "Gone With The Wind", I ain't sayin' it's a bad movie. I mean, hell, I've seen it five or six times but it's, what do they call it? Fantasy? It's fantasy! Honey, pass the peas. Mm. It's an insult to the coloreds. - Coloreds? - Mm-hm. - I don't believe we use that particular term anymore. - Well, that's my point, actually. Your point? - So, you got Hawaii, huh? Sounds more like a vacation than a tour of duty. - Sure, I mean, you Southerners, you change the terms but not the attitude, you know what I mean? I can't say's I do. - We were under the impression that you were a Southerner yourself. - Oh, no, sir. I abandoned that notion a long time ago. I got family in Ada, Oklahoma now. I like to consider that my home. We like to call it Southwest! - Chris, honey. Why don't you join me in the backyard for some coffee? Daddy and Dusty will do the dishes. Well, anything to get out of the dishes. Don't you go breakin' anything. - Mm, just your daddy's heart. - What the hell got into you? - Stop it, Mama! Before it's too late! - It's already too late! - I love her! - She the first woman you ever slept with? - What kind of question is that? - You're 18 years old. Some woman takes you to bed and you're like a hound in heat! I understand that! Why the hell you had to marry, I'll never know! - I've got my reasons, Mama, but you're too damn stubborn to listen to 'em. - That's right, I am stubborn! When it comes to you and you're future, I am the most stubborn woman you will ever find! - My future is my decision! That's something you've never understood! You never once, not once, asked me for my opinion of it! She's the first woman who's ever treated me like I was a man! - Bein' a man between the sheets is easy. - I've heard enough. - I have tried. God knows I have tried to instill in you some passion for your possibilities! I love you more than life itself. You are the one blessing God has granted me. And you will always be welcome here. But I will not have that woman in my home again. - Well. That's just fine, Mother Mary. I was savin' the blessed news for the right time, and I do believe this is the right time. How would you civilized, hospitable Southerners put it? I'm with child. And since you just closed your door to me, well, you just closed your door to your grandchild, too. Come on, honey, we're gettin' the hell outta here. Honey? Chris! - Hello? She is? When? Oh, my God, now? Now? Okay. Cover for me! Whoa. - Arthur Services. Yeah, just a minute. Mary, it's for you. - Yes, Mary Brown speaking. Mama, it's me! - Chris? Oh, my God, it's Chris! Honey, are you all right? I'm fine, Mama. - Well, how I've prayed to hear your voice. - Look, Mom, I got some news for ya! You're a grandma. - What? Terrah Christine Brown was born, all six pounds, eight ounces of her at 9:15 this mornin'. - A grandma! Oh, honey! I'm on my way out, I'll just make a reservation, I'll call you as soon as- - Well, Mama, I ain't sure that's such a good idea right now. - What do you mean? - Well, it's just that it ain't the best idea. - Somethin' wrong with the baby? - Oh, no, no, not at all. Well, it's Dusty, you know. She probably wouldn't like it. Give me some time to work on it? - Chris. - Look, I'll work on it, okay? - I'm happy for you, son. - Thanks, Mama. Bye. - No way I'm ever gonna see that grandbaby. - Hey, Chris! Check it out! - Oh, my God! You okay? Huh? - Is she all right? - Hold her. - You okay? - Get off of her! Get off! - Ow! What are you- Chris, you're hurting me! - Hey, pal! Get your hands off! - She's my wife, pal! You got any objections? - Oh, stop it, Chris! - She could have drowned, Dusty. - I was just havin' a little fun. - You were supposed to be watchin' her! Vince and I we're about to come out of the water! - You were in there for half an hour! What was I supposed to do, just sit around all day- - No, you pick up the baby, you bring her down to the water, you yell at me to get out and I'll get out! You don't leave the baby alone! - She was asleep. - No she was playin' in the water while you're playin' pincushion to a bunch of damn horny Marines! - We was playing football! - Oh, is that what you've been doin' with them, huh? - What are you talkin' about? Hmm? - Forget it. - No, Chris! What are you throwin' at me? - Oh, it ain't what I'm throwin' at you, sweetheart. It's what you've been throwin' around! - You're a crazy man, you know that? - Half the damn Marine base knows where you spend your free time! It is free, isn't it, or are you startin' to charge for that? - I don't have to stand here and listen to this crap. - I'm not through with you. Through? Darlin', you can't even get it started anymore. - Baby, I'm sorry. No, honey, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, honey! Sorry! I'm sorry, I didn't mean to, I'm sorry, I'm sorry! - Yeah. - Dusty. Dusty, it's Mary. May I speak to Chris, please. - We're asleep. - Dusty, please. I just wanna talk to him. - Well, I'll tell him you called. If I remember. That mouse is driving me nuts. Dusty? Hey! - Huh? What's goin' on? - I'm watchin' the kid! - Watchin' her, she's filthy! Who are you? Where's my wife? - Look! She just asked me if I wanted to make a couple of bucks! Get outta here! - Hey, I've already been here two hours so you owe me- - Now! That's okay, baby! That's okay, baby. Daddy will get you cleaned up. - Hey, guys! How you doin'? - This is Sergeant Robert Summers. He's mine. - Oh, that ain't been settled yet! How you doin'? - Nice to meet you. - Hank can get us some acid. - Oh, yeah! First, I wanna drink. First, I wanna drink, Bobby, get me a drink. - You're a whore! - You're crazy. - Break it up. - Hey, hey, hey! - Get off me! - Let's go. - You don't own me, Chris! - Let's go! - You are crazy! I'll take Christine and we're movin' out! - Yeah, you're damn right you're movin' out but you're not takin' daughter with you! - We'll see about that. - There he is. - Oh, he's so thin! You're so thin! Look at you! How are you, son? - It is painful, Chris, but we have all decided that it's for the best. Chris is here on emergency leave. We don't have much time. We want Dusty served with divorce papers. But most importantly, we wanna make sure that she can't get her hands on Christine. - You in agreement on this? - Yes, sir. - Of course, we agree, Harry. Now, he has to go back to Hawaii and Christine is far better off with us until the divorce is final. - Well, if you're all in accord, then I will, I'll have both of the divorce agreement and the um- - Temporary custody. - And the papers drawn up granting your parents temporary custody of little Terrah Christine. As long as you're sure. - Yeah, I'm sure. - Chrissy belongs with us, where she'll be loved and cared for. Isn't that right, Nana's girl? Yes! Yes! - You supposed to be doin' that? - Good for me. Keeps my blood thin. - Mama tells me you ain't been feelin' so good. - Yeah, well, I'm not gettin' any younger, son. But as long as I can still go fishin', all is well with God's world. - What happened, Daddy? What do you mean? - I mean, you ain't old but you act it. - I'm real sorry about your marriage, son. But I'm glad you got away from here. - Show Nana the birdie! Where is it? There it is! - May I ask you a question, son? - Sure. - Do you still love that woman? - Of course I love her. - Then no matter what your mother or your grandmother or anybody else thinks, if you still love her, if she still excites you, then you get back with her and stay the hell away from here. - But you're my family. - And we will always be so. But you have your own family now, son. You have a daughter and a wife. Oh, son. Don't you think I had plans when we started out? Hell, yes, I had my dreams. But before we knew what was goin' on, your grandmother swooped down on us with the promise of all this free land and a free house, and a secure future. All of that stuff for our freedom. - I do believe we have a future gymnast in the family. - Come on, baby. I think she's gonna be so happy here. Tomorrow we're goin' shoppin'! She needs a new wardrobe! - Look, Mama. Don't get too settled. I think I'm gonna go back and try to work things out with Dusty. - What? Son, you made a mistake. We all do! If you go back to that woman, you won't be the only one payin' for your mistake! It'll be Chrissy, too! - I'm sorry, Mama. It's okay, baby, do you wanna stay with Nana? Dusty? Dusty? Honey? - If you'd lose weight, you wouldn't need so much of the mirror. And if you was a little younger, you wouldn't even spend so much time in front of it. Give me the lavender. - I'll get it. If that's Rocky, tell him to keep his pants on, I'll be out in a minute! - If that's Rocky, he'll already have his pants off! Dusty says, you'd better keep your pants on! Oh. It's you. - Yeah, it's me. - Dusty? Got a surprise package here. And I bet it's wrapped just as tight as can be! - Wow, Dusty. You sure know how to put it together. - Look, I left you a note sayin' I'd call so, if you don't mind, this is kind of a bad time. - I need to talk with you. - Yeah, well, we can do that on the phone. - I wasn't expecting you to move out. - Oh, you weren't? Well, then, what's that about, Chris? Your lawyer makes it very clear you want a divorce, you got it. - Yeah, well, I changed my mind. - Did you bring Christine back with you? - I figure we'd work things out first. - Well, you bring Christine back, then maybe we'll work things out. But in the meantime, you keep your hands to yourself. - I'm your husband! - Well, then what do you got in your hand, Chris? - It was a mistake, all right? Dusty. I look at you and it's like nothing else matters. - That's very sweet, honey. But the fact is, I'm doin' just fine without you. Better, in fact. For the first time in a long time, I'm havin' a little fun. - Yeah, well, you're my wife and you're plannin' on havin' any kind of fun, it's gonna be with me. Sweet boy. I don't need you for fun. And I don't need you for anythin', I got new friends, a job. - What the hell kind of job? - With a refined woman on the other side of the island. Mrs. Vogel. And she happens to think I'm highly qualified. - Dusty, the only thing you look qualified for is sittin' on a barstool with your skirt up over your head. - Well, that shows what you know. I happen to work on an estate. Mrs. Vogel breeds dogs and she trusts me enough to take care of them! Wait, you take care of her dogs? - Mm-hm, and her birds. You clean up after her dogs. Dusty, Rocky's here! Who's Rocky? - He's a man. A man who don't think of his mama every time he climbs into bed with me. Hi, baby, you okay? - Yeah. - Yeah? - Yeah, let's just go, okay? - Hey, these are yours. And they're legal. Let me tell you somethin' else. You ain't gettin' squat from me. You think you can live off what you get paid scoopin' up after after a pack of dogs, no, you ain't nothin' but trash. - Hey, who you callin' trash, - huh? - Oh, save it, baby! - You crazy? He aint' worth it! You know what, Chris Brown? I wish you was dead. I wish I could put on a pretty black dress and pretend to grieve all over your dead body! - I ain't teach you a lesson, boy. - If you don't mind my saying so, you're a damn fool. You're the wife of a Marine. And a Marine's got certain expectations of other women. And as ridiculous as it may sound, fidelity is one of 'em. Look who's talking. - Well, tell her. She oughta know. - Look, when I got tired of Stuart, I figured hell, dump him! Get a divorce, right, get support, hang on to his benefits and I'd be a free woman of leisure. - Only Stuart got himself a lawyer. - And I found out it don't work that way. - If you get divorced, honey, the only way to seize any benefits is little Chrissy. You get nothing. - What do you mean I get nothing? I'm his wife. - You don't matter. Only way a wife gets a Marine's benefits is if she's his widow. - Mm-hm. That's right. You'll be out on your butt, like me. Dependent on the kindness of strangers, as it were. - Or you make sure you got someone to take up the slack. You get yourself another Marine with benefits! - Hell, I can't stand the one I'm with. Widow? - That's the ballgame. - Well, then, I wish he was dead. - You do not. - No, I do! I wish the son of a bitch was dead. Mm, six months? - I just got orders so movin' out in two days. - And what's gonna happen to me? I count on you. I can't keep payin' rent here. I mean, Patty ain't helpin' and we've already been threatened with eviction. Besides, I was kinda countin' on us movin' in together. Mm, maybe gettin' married. - Honey, I gotta put that on hold. - But... - It's only six months. Just six months. Where you goin'? Where you goin'? - Rocky, I got some thinkin' to do. I mean, maybe, we're movin' a lot too quick here. Maybe Chris and I should- - Dusty. - Well, I was figurin' on bein' with you. Six months, that's a long time. I gotta have some place to live. Somebody to... Yeah, well, with you gone, I mean, the only one I got left is Chris. - Hey. He's divorcing you. Remember that? - Maybe. Maybe I'm wrong about that. Chris, he ain't so bad sometimes. - I ain't ever lettin' you go back to him. You hear me? - I don't want to, honey. But what else can I do? So tonight's the big night, huh? - I don't know. She says she wants to stop by and talk about gettin' back together. - Kinda out of the blue, isn't it? - Who knows? Maybe she can't live without me. Yeah. - Dusty? Dusty? Yeah? Who's callin'? Dusty, it's for you. It's a Captain Mallory. Captain? The girl's movin' up! - Hello? - Hello. Mary? It's Dusty. - Dusty. It's, it's about Chris? - Yes? Dusty, what is it? - Oh, God. He's been murdered. - What are you talkin' about? - Stabbed in his apartment. There were 26 stab wounds all over his body. 26, Mary. And his thumb? His right thumb was, was... Jack. Jack! Jack! - He was gonna make you dinner? Yeah. We were gonna talk about gettin' back together. - Was that, was that his idea or yours? - Both, I guess. - You been separated before? - We had trouble but we could've worked it out. Sure. Any boyfriends? - I loved Chris. - No boyfriends. No! Of course not! - Was he, was he seein' anyone? - Yeah, I think so. Well, there were these rumors there was someone. Married woman. Do you know her name? - Smith or somethin'. - Smith? Somethin' like that. - "Yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I shall fear no evil, for Thou art with me, Thy rod and Thy staff they comfort me." - Breakfast is ready, honey. - Dusty called again. She says they think they have a suspect. - Who? - A Corporal Smith. Bob Smith. She says Chris was havin' an affair with his wife. - I don't believe it. - She asked for money. - What? - She says she has no money. Until things are settled, she has nothing to live on. Mama, what are we gonna do without him? I wanna die, Mama. I just wanna die. - I know, baby. I know. - Mrs. Brown, I'm sorry, but I don't know what you're talkin' about! - You're the investigatin' officer! - And I'm tellin' you, ma'am, we have no suspect in custody! At this moment, we have no suspect, period. Then where would she get that information? Unless she was lyin'. - I don't know. - I want a copy of the autopsy report. - Certainly, the autopsy's scheduled for tomorrow. - Lieutenant, there must have been one already. No, ma'am. - If there's been no autopsy yet, how would my son's wife know about the number of stab wounds? About his thumb? - I will look into that. Mrs. Brown, let me assure you, my main priority right now is finding your son's killer. Lieutenant? She's here. - Show her in. Mrs. Brown, I apologize, I've got an appointment but I promise I will keep you informed. Have seat, Ms. Carlin. - I don't want to. - Have a seat, please. Thank you. Coffee? - No! Look, I don't have to be here, you know. You got no right just to order me to- - Whoa, whoa, were you ordered? Ma'am, I am sorry, it was meant as a request. - Yeah, well. - You know, Ms. Carlin. Now, I got a dead Marine. Young kid, he's one of us! And I figured the way he was killed, well, I mean, whoever did it must have known him really well, wouldn't you say? - I wouldn't say! - And since you've been living with his widow for some time now, I figure either you're a good source of information or you're an accessory. - Are you nuts? - Sit down, please. - The hell I will! I'm a civilian, you can't order me around! You can't do anything to me! - Well, ma'am, you're right. Carlin is your married name, correct? - When I was married, yeah. - And before that, and Slater, Hutchins and- Did you ever work at a club in Honolulu called the Lollipop Bar? - Whatever you got there, I'm still a civilian and the damn Marines can't do nothing to a civilian! - Again, ma'am, you are correct. But the damned Marines can, Ms. Carlin, certainly turn this over to the proper civilian authorities for their handling. Sit down, please. Thank you. You gonna write me? - I don't think that's such a good idea, Rocky. - Honey, I'm gonna be on deployment for six months. - I know! We'll catch up when you get back. Okay? - I love you. You know that. - Mm, I know. - I'll miss you. See ya. Attention, please. The next flight for Manila will be leaving in 15 minutes. - Get me an escort to the air strip. Once he takes off, we can't catch him till he reaches Manila. - Where's he gonna go, sir? He can't jump out of a plane over the middle of the Pacific. - Sergeant, this murder was committed in bare feet less than 24 hours ago. Now, chances are we can still find traces of blood on those feet. We need him now, go! All passengers, take your seats. Cabin attendants, cross check and prepare for takeoff. - You see, the problem with women in this day and age is just like they got no sense, you know, of future. You know what I mean? She's beautiful, isn't she? Yeah. What you can't see in the picture, you see in here. I tell you. She planned my future. I love her. - Private Jackson? Yes, sir? - Oh. Jackson, would you take your shoes off for me? - Ready, aim, fire! Ready, aim, fire! Ready, aim, fire! - It's all right, baby. It's all right. It's for your daddy. It's on your daddy! - Honey, what are you doin'? - I want every one of 'em. - Honey, don't. - Every one of 'em! I don't want 'em to rest until they've got his killer! - They do, Mary. - I'm talkin' about Dusty! No, no, darlin'. That's not right. However you feel about her, that doesn't mean she was involved with this. - Why don't you care? Please. We don't need any more trouble. Please. - Let me have this, Jack! It's the one thing that's keepin' me alive! I don't see why there has to be a trial at all! He's guilty, he admits it! - It's not a question of whether he killed your son, but how and why. - Bless you. - Thank you. He's pleading self defense. The court martial will determine whether- - Self defense! Let him say that to my face! - As a possible witness, you won't be allowed in the courtroom during the trial. A witness room is set aside for you and the others. - As Chris's mother, I have every right to be in that courtroom! - No, ma'am, you don't. You do- - Have you bothered to take anything for that? - Just one of life's miseries, ma'am. - So is this. Quite honestly, Captain. I don't think the NIS is doing it's job. - A suspect has been arrested and is being brought to trial. - Only one of 'em. - Mrs. Brown, we don't have any jurisdiction over civilians. Now, even if we suspected your son's wife of conspiracy, we couldn't touch her. - Maybe you can't. But I can. Heaven's sake! Hi. - The man in the loud shirt, that's Kenny Hilker. He owns the Lollipop Bar. He's also a dealer. Drugs. The girls know him well and Chris and Dusty spent a lot of time there. - Why? - Mrs. Brown, Chris wasn't an angel. - Are they here for the prosecution or the defense? - I don't know. - Is it true, Mrs. Brown, that you were involved with Private Jackson at the time of your husband's murder? - We were friends. - Do you sleep with all your friends? - Objection! - The night of the murder, they asked her if she had a boyfriend, she said no. Well, hell, we know she had a boyfriend! Rocky! - How do you explain Private Jackson having a key to Private Brown's apartment. - One key? Hell, I heard she had several keys made. When Chris was on float, she used that apartment like a motel room. - Mm-hm. Now Rocky refuses to implicate Dusty in any way. He claims he loves her and my guess is he's tryin' to protect her. - Captain, he can claim he loves her all he wants and God knows I don't know what's goin' on that boy's brain, but let me ask you something. If he took the stand and he implicated Dusty, what would that tell you? - Conspiracy. - Pre-meditation, Captain. Now, I have done a lot of readin' on victims' rights and I can tell you one thing for sure! If he admits that she planned this, then he's admittin' pre-meditation! And that means he could hang. Now, maybe he loves his neck more than he loves Dusty. - Maybe. - If they were in it for the money, they're gonna be mighty disappointed. - What do you mean? - I put a court order to stop on the insurance and benefits. Here. Take this! Please! I'll be down in a minute. - I'll be right back. You got me evicted! I did no such thing. - You stopped all of Chris's benefits! I got no money comin' in. How do you expect me to live! - Whether you live or not is of no concern to me. How you live is and I will not have you livin' off my son's death. - So you just come over here to gloat? - I am enjoyin' a certain degree of satisfaction. Seems you have no problem findin' men to take care of you. - He's helpin' me move. - Into his place? - Look, Mother Brown, no matter what you think, I did not kill your son! I loved Chris! I tried to make it work, we were gonna get back together! - Tell me something. Is it denial or deception that guides your life? - You think Chris deserves someone better? Someone more to your choosin'? Well, let me tell you, Mother Brown, Chris was no boy scout! He abused me and he abused our daughter. - Chris would never strike that child! - He would and he did. Now you can do what you will but you ain't gonna take Christine. - Dusty. You will never see her again. - I am her natural mother. And I promise you, no matter what I have to do, you ain't gonna hold onto her! My dear, you have neither the brains nor the imagination to even contemplate what I might do to you! My hell began the night my son was murdered. Your hell? It's just beginning. Mrs. Brown, over here, please! - Are you all right? Justice was served here, Mrs. Brown. I hope you feel some relief. - Chris is sittin' here. That's what I feel right now, Captain. I feel Chris. I feel his anger. I feel his terrible sadness that he will never be a part of his daughter's life. - I know how difficult this must be for you. - You have children, Captain? - Yes, ma'am, I have a daughter. - Mm. You ever promise your daughter that everything's gonna be all right? When she skins her knee or has a nightmare or fever? Did you ever tell her, "Don't worry, honey, Daddy's here. Everything's gonna be fine." - Sure. - I did, too. I raised my boy to believe that his world was safe. That Mama and Daddy would make sure that everything will be all right. Well, Ralph "Rocky" Jackson and Dusty Johnson made a liar out of me. They took my child. And they butchered him. And you wanna know if I'm all right. - Mrs. Brown, you got the man who killed your son. You'll never get the woman. Let it rest. - If it were your child, Captain, could you let it rest? Good day. Look over your shoulder, see who's comin' down the driveway! Is that your grandma? Is she comin' here? - Yeah. - Did I keep my promise? Well, look at that, let us go and see Grandma! Oh, hurry, hurry! Nana! - Nana's little princess! - Welcome home, darlin'. - Thank you. I hear Papa promised you a dog! - Oh, I don't know! - Well, if that's what he promised you, you're gonna get it! And you know what that pup's gonna do to you? He's gonna kiss you all over your face, just like this! You're gonna get more kisses than any little girl could handle! I'm gonna make it up to you, baby. I promise. - Listen, sister, drinkin' ain't gonna help. - Drinkin' helps everything. - You gotta just let it go. - My daughter is the only thing I have left in this world. She belongs to me, not to her. - Try to get Christine back, that woman's gonna bring the wrath of Satan down on you. - Well, the devil's been livin' with me a long time. And I'll be damned if I let that bitch have her. - You're turnin' this place into a mausoleum. - This was Chris's home. - He's buried in the cemetery, this is too much. - Too much what? - You're takin' on his death like you're the only one who cared. - Oh, I'm sure you care, Jack. I'm sure the guilt weighs heavily on your mind. - What are you talkin' about? - I know if I were you, I'd find it hard to look at his picture. What in the hell are you accusin' me of? - Nothing! But none of these is comin' down. This is the only way I have to keep my son alive. And one of us has to do it, Jack. I'm afraid it falls to me since you're the one who killed him. - How could you say such a thing? - You signed his death warrant. - But he wanted to join the Marine Corps, it was his own personal choice! - He was 17 years old! He was a child! And I want him back, Jack, I want my baby back! - I want him back, too! I'm gonna tell you something else. I let him go because you're always holdin' on to him so hard! Forgive me, I'm very sorry, but I saw what happened to us. All our dreams died a slow death because your mother could not let go! And I loved you and I stayed here for you and it killed me. And I was afraid we're gonna kill Chris, too, but you're right! He would be alive today if it wasn't for me! And I wish I was dead because of it! - This baby needs you, Jack. She needs us. And I need you. - You never have before. - I'm sorry for what I said. You didn't kill him, Jack. She did. She did! And we're gonna prove it. Together. Please. - Mornin', sir. - Good morning. Mr. Brown? Yes, sir? - This is for you. - Thank you. - Here you go, sweetheart. And sugar raisins! - All right! - All right! Mary. Looks like Dusty got herself a lawyer. She wants her baby back. Now. - Is that sugar? The court ordered you temporary guardianship. And the only way you're gonna make that permanent is by proving her an unfit mother and that's gonna be tough. That's your word against hers. - Now, Chris told us that he found that baby sittin' in her own- - Excrement. - If you'll excuse the expression. - Hearsay. - What all do we have to do? - Well, let me run a background check. What's her maiden name? Charlene Johnson. Family? - Well, we know there's a sister over in Ada, Oklahoma. - Okay. You two sit tight. I'll run a check, see what we can find out. - I'm not gonna sit tight! You tell me what we need, I'll find it! - Mary, Dusty was legally married to your son. She is Terrah Christine's natural mother. To my knowledge, she has not been charged with any crime. And she has no record. And there's no documented evidence of abuse. What you are going to need, Mary, is a miracle. - Officer Stone speakin' here, who's speakin' now? - This is Mary Brown. - Mrs. Brown, how you doin'? Fine, Parker, just fine. And how's that little boy of yours? - Oh, much better, thanks. What can I do you for? - Parker, suppose a private citizen wanted to get some background information on another private citizen in another state, of course, could that be done? Well, like what? - Oh, birth certificate, drivin' record, credit, things like that. - Well, for a lot of that stuff, you need a court order or... - Oh, Well. That'd be too much trouble, wouldn't be worth it. All right then, Parker, thank you, I'll try somethin' else. - Now, hold on there, Mrs. Brown! Maybe I can help you. What specifically you got in mind? Mornin', Mrs. Brown! - Mornin', Parker. - Oh, nice dog! - Parker, meet Bubba. - And he sure do love that little girl, don't he? - Parker? - Yes, ma'am? Yes, ma'am, listen, I did some tracking for you, I don't know if it's gonna do you much good. As far as this Charlene Johnson goes, there ain't much. Just some teenage stuff then she kinda disappeared. - What does that mean? - Well, the next thing I got on her was just a couple of tickets issued to a Charlene Forrest. A Charlene Johnson Forrest. - Thank you, Parker. Yes, ma'am! - Mrs. Brown, you only have one child, is that right? Yes, sir. - Terrah Christine Brown is your only child. - Yes, sir. - The name Forrest mean anything to you? - Forest, like woods or... - No, ma'am. I mean Forrest like your first husband. You were married before, weren't you, Mrs. Brown? Mrs. Brown? - Briefly. It was nothin', I tried to forget about it. - I bet you do. It seems like you forgot about your first child, too. So now, I'm gonna ask you again. Is Terrah Christine Brown your only child? - I thought you meant by my marriage to Chris. Chris and I have only one child. - Forget what you thought I meant and answer the question. Do you have another child? - Yes, sir. - A daughter. Is that correct? - Yes, sir. - And where is this child, Mrs. Brown? Where is this first daughter of yours? - With her father. - And why is that? Why is your first child, like your second child, not with you? It's because your first husband was granted sole custody, isn't it? Isn't it! - Yes. Because you abandoned her, is that not correct? Objection! No further questions. You gonna give Bubba a kiss? - Yeah. - Okay, come on, Bubba, get over here and give the baby a kiss. Give him a kiss. Oh, good. Should Papa give Bubba a kiss? - Yeah. - Okay, here, Bubba. Here's a kiss from Papa! - Yeah. - Should Nana give Bubba a kiss? - Yeah. - I think so, too. Your turn. - Uh-huh. - Mm-hm. - 'Night, Bubba. - Now you're ready to go to sleep! - No. - No? Well, I'm ready to go to sleep! - If you think that I am gonna stand out in that yard and call for Bubba, you're outta your mind! - Oh, honey, I am surprised at you! Bubba is a fine Southern name with a long tradition. - Thank you. For all your help, standin' by me. - Well, we still got our little Chrissy and that's what's important. We don't have to fight Dusty anymore. Just let it go and God will take care of it. - I do feel some kind of peace, finally. Maybe you're right. Let go and let God. - Mm-hm. Whoo! Did you see that? You stick one of these under a rabbit and bam! You got rabbit stew. - Talbot, quit it! - Well, Dusty, we need us a little excitement around here! Hell, since you got back from Alabama, you ain't been worth squat. - Look you want excitement, Talbot? Then do the what I'm askin' and you'll get all the excitement you can handle. It's a dumb idea and you're too dumb to carry it off. - That's why I need you, Talbot, you're the brains. - Yeah, I can stick your head in a bucket and blow that up, too. How's your back, honey? - You know damn well. - Can only milk that back for so long. Disability folks are gonna catch up with you sooner or later and find out you been working day jobs off the books, and then what? - You been raggin' on me since Easter. I've had enough of it. - If we get Chrissy here, we can live off her Daddy's benefits. Insurance, social security. Our worries will be over. Here, honey. - So if we do this thing, you'll do exactly as I say. No questions, no arguments. - Mm-hm. You just tell me what to do and I'll do it. Baby, you look a little tired and I think it's time for a nasty nap. Thank you, darlin'. - This is it, they're here. - We said that every year, don't we, Mama? Be careful! - Goodnight, Mama! - Nighty-night now, Mama! Bye, sweetheart! - She asleep? - Mm-hm. - Evenin'! - Evenin'. - I'm sorry to trouble you folks, but I got myself a flat! - How can we help? - Well, I don't have a spare, sir, and I- - Well, we got nothing that will fix that. I hate to trouble you but is there a phone anywhere around here? - Well, there's one about four or five miles from here! Hey! - Hey, what are you doin'? Hey! - Hey! Jack! Jack, it's Dusty! Jack! Go! - Whoo, yeah! - Dusty! Dusty! Dusty! - Help me. My baby! - Oklahoma, where do you think they came from? - I don't know ma'am, that's why I'm asking. - Okay, do something! - I wanna help you, ma'am, but there ain't much I can do! This here's a misdemeanor. - Misdemeanor! That woman kidnapped Christine! Her own daughter, ma'am? - We have custodial rights, ma'am. - Mrs. Brown, Mr. Brown, I wanna help you, I really do. But these are liberal times and I gotta be careful. I go chasing somebody across the state line and I got trouble myself I can't handle. - Aw, the hell with it. Hobby, will you come with me, please? Billy and Frank, will y'all follow us in your pickup? We're gonna go after them ourselves. Bye, darling, I'm gonna bring her back. - How come one week ago legislation was passed and signed into law by the governor, making parental kidnapping a felony in the state of Alabama! - Ma'am, we got no information on that. - It passed, Parker, it's on the books! - All we can do, ma'am, is- - Nothing, apparently. Thank you very much. - Where you going? - Georgia. Georgia, that's the wrong way! - It's only 10 miles to the border. Once we're in Georgia, they can't catch us and we'll just cross through Tennessee. Now, unless you wanna cross the entire state of Alabama with them snapping on our heels, I suggest you just settle down and enjoy the ride. - Stop it now, I'm your mama. Everything is gonna be just fine. I wanna go home. - That's exactly what we're doing, honey. We're going home. - I'm so sorry. - Bo! Bo! Come on, it's only 11 o'clock in the morning. I doubt if it's past 70 degrees in here. You think that can wait a while. - Harry, I'm a fat man, you're a fat man. I assume you would understand 'cause you perspire like a fat man. But if I don't get it below 65 degrees by noon, I'm gonna sweat and you're gonna suffer for it. Helen, would you call maintenance and tell that sucker if he's not up here working on my air, I'm gonna revoke his parole, thank you. All right, now. What we got here is a case of unfortunate circumstances. - There's only one reason she wants Christine. - Mary. - Chris's benefits go to his daughter, she wants to live on them. - One of the perks of being a judge, Mary, is that I don't have to tolerate interruptions. There's no question that you got a legal right to your granddaughter here in Alabama. But she's in Oklahoma now with her natural mother. While that may be intolerable for Alabama, Oklahoma could see that as sweet justice. - I'll file a brief in Oklahoma requesting a custody hearing. - What about kidnapping? - Most courts are gonna see this as nothing more than a family squabble. You got a tough legal fight ahead of you. And if I was a betting man... - You still owe me 50 bucks from the derby. - If I was a betting man, I'd put my money on Oklahoma. Five to one. - Just spotted them here on Main Street. They just drove by, they're going north. - I see them, they're coming past me right now. There's another one. - They're passing Bender Street. - The state of Oklahoma recognizes the God-given right of a child's natural mother. - Your Honor- - Now, you folks in Alabama may think that it's right and proper to remove a child from the love and affection that only a mother can give. But Oklahoma, a state of infinite compassion, thinks otherwise. Therefore, it is the opinion of this court that Charlene Brown be awarded permanent and natural custody of her daughter, Tara Christine Brown. So long as Miss Brown remains within the borders of this state. And then again, why wouldn't she? This hearing is adjourned. Come on, baby, let's go. - Nanny, poppop! - Honey, be quiet. Christine, be quiet. - It's nothing but a carnival to them! - Bo warned us it wasn't gonna be easy. Said our chances of getting Chrissy back were very slim. - I understand the legal system, Jack. I just don't accept it. - We could get an appeal. All the way to the Supreme Court. - And while we're bouncing from court to court, the magic in that baby girl will die a little bit everyday. And that evil woman will be celebrating her victory. - Mary was tracking this one. Mary? - Yes, yes, the docket - number is A9557 - B113. Yes, ma'am, I understand. But I was told that the case was turned over to the FBI. If it's not your office, whose office is it? - We need you on this. - It was a court marshal. I know you have no jurisdiction, I understand that. But I was told by the NIS that all... Naval Intelligence Service. I was told that all information regarding Charlene Brown was turned over to the FBI. You're the FBI. Now, all I wanna know is the name of the agent handling the case. Then what office do I call? - Did you see that? Now that one ain't gonna have no babies. Pull! - No eclairs? - Burke and Jones got them on the third floor. - So what, you only had two? - Mr. Hennessy, all we're asking for is a progress report on your investigation of Charlene Brown. - No chocolate either. - We have called you four times and all you tell us is that you're working on it. - Your case is one of 100, Mrs. Brown. Whatever happened to bear claws? You always used to have bear claws! - Forget about your damn bear claws, mister, and listen to the woman! We've got a son murdered here and our whole family turned apart because of it. Seems to me, the very least you could do was share whatever information you had on one Charlene Brown! - I am handed a list of priorities and I go through each case as it's listed. Now, I can't tell you just exactly where on that list your particular case happens to be. - Why not? You know when he's out of bear claws. - As I understand it, the man who killed your son was arrested, tried, and sent to Leavenworth. - And the case against his wife was turned over to you. - And I will get to it. Just be patient. Give me the sugar doughnut. - I think we can be patient somewhere else, darling. Thank you very much for your kind help. - Yeah, yeah, bye. - Oh my god, somebody help me! - You wanna get that? - It's your phone. - Yeah? - Diane? Yeah. - It's Rocky. Let me speak to Dusty, is Dusty there? - No, no, she ain't here. I ain't seen Dusty for weeks, I guess. - How would I reach her? - Like I said, Rocky, we ain't that close, you know. She goes where she wants to go. - Well, I don't have that luxury, do I? You give her a message for me, okay. You tell her that she hasn't written me in over two months, she ain't ever call me. You tell her she better write me, or else, you know... - Or else what? - Hey, you just tell her, you hear me, huh! - He says you ain't written. - So? - Well, he says you better, or else. - Or else what? What are they gonna do, give him a weekend pass? - Come on, let's go. - Look at me, I'm scared. The movie ain't over yet. - Well, they shoot up the car and they're dead. The end. - Okay, you be a good girl, honey. - You're not leaving her with me. - You promised. - I did not. - Diane, I asked you three days ago. - I got a date. - That's great, perfect! - She ain't my kid, Talbot! - Well, she ain't mine either! No, no! - Thanks a lot. Talbot, it's not my fault. - Oh, nothing's ever your fault! Get in the damn car. - Mommy! - Shut up, Chrissy. - She's got a restraining order. If you get within 50 feet of her, you can be arrested. One sec. Hi. Coffee? Give me just a second. Yeah, yeah, sure, I can follow her. That's not going to change the situation. Look, you're charged with physical abuse. They have the bruises to prove it. Yeah, well same to you. Mrs. Brown, yes? - Yes. - Hi, I'm Arlo McDaniel. - How do you do? You don't quite know what to make of me, do you? - You're not exactly what I expected. My mother said the same thing. Have a seat. I'm sorry. What did you expect? - I don't know, I've never done this before. - Look, what makes a good PI is curiosity, Mrs. Brown. Plain and simple curiosity. I love surprises, questions. What do you like? - Experience, Mr. McDaniel. - That's easy. I don't drink, don't smoke. And I'm curious as hell. - My son was murdered, Mr. McDaniel. - I'm sorry to hear that, Mrs. Brown. - The man who killed him, he's in jail. The woman behind it has my granddaughter. - The woman behind it? - She was counting on my son's insurance benefits, but I had those turned over to my granddaughter. That's why she took her. - For the benefits? - There's not much evidence of love, if that's what you mean. - Just what is it that you need from me? - What I need is justice, Mr. McDaniel. What I need from you is one man, just one man who gives a damn about justice. - Come on, Christine, let's go. - She's staying here. - What? - You stay there, Chrissy, until I come fetch you, understand? - Talbot! What do you think you're gonna do? - I'm gonna enjoy myself. I haven't enjoyed myself with you for over a week. It's time. Come on. - Talbot! - 20 minutes! She ain't gonna freeze to death. Now come on, it's time, come on. Come on. - Hello? Mrs. Brown? - Yes? - This is Donald Stewart from Senator Waycorf's office. - Oh good, put him on. - Well, the Senator's in a meeting right now but I do have the information you requested. - Go ahead. - Okay, the file number is F63-2900-1544. - Got it. - And the person to call is an Alice Pasqueletti. - Pasque... - Letti, L-E-T-T-I. And Mrs. Brown, the Senator said you could use his name once, that's all. - You tell him once is all I need and you give that big bear a hug for me. Thank you. - No, no, that won't do. Put Gettinger on with Kreager as backup. Whatever it takes. What the hell are you doing? - I want your undivided attention, Mr. Hennessy. - I'll call security. - No! No, it's all right, leave us alone for a minute. - I am sorry. Did I interrupt some high priority case you've been busting your butt on? - I explained to you, Mrs. Brown- - Like tracking down ceramic elephants being shipped across the state line? - You don't just go busting... How do you know about those elephants? - Mister, I was born and raised in Alabama. Senator Waycorf and I, we used to play doctor when we were kids. Now, you have yourself a list of 12 high priority cases. Those elephants are number one, my son is number eight. - Ma'am, stealing FBI files is a felony. - I have tried to impress on you the need to investigate Charlene Brown and her involvement in my son's murder! And all I get from you is one excuse after another. Well sir, let me tell you what I'm gonna do about that. I am going to channel's two, four, and seven. And I'm gonna tell them that the FBI doesn't have time for the mother of a murdered Alabama marine because they're too busy tracking down ceramic elephants! Mommy! - It's okay, it's okay, I'm not gonna hurt you. - What do you think you're doing? - I'm sorry, mister, but she was about to- - Get your hands off her! Put her down! I could blow your head off and claim you was trespassing. - I was just passing by. - Well then, just keep on passing, boy. - Well, someone should be watching her. You stay close to the door, you hear? And thank you for not blowing my head off. Yes, sir. - Get on up here. Come on! Get in the house. - Jack, supper's ready. Jack? Jack? Baker to the OR, Doctor Baker to the OR. Mrs. Mary Brown? Yes? - Hi, I'm Special Agent Warren Matthews from the FBI. I went to your house and your mother told me that you were here. I'm very sorry, ma'am, is there anything I can do? - That depends on why you're here, Mr. Matthews? - I've been assigned to investigate the conspiracy case against your daughter-in-law. I know, I've heard it before. I can't do much about the outside, but ma'am, I assure you in this matter, you will have my undivided attention and commitment. - I suppose I should be grateful they bothered at all. Mr. Matthews, my husband may be dying as we speak, under the circumstances, I do hope you can be taken at your word. Frankly, I don't think I could take another disappointment, sir. Hi. - Hi. - While you're here, how about having that bump in your nose fixed? - What bump? - I almost didn't marry you 'cause of that bump in your nose. - There is no bump on my nose. - Mama said to me, she said, "Mary, Jack is a good man but how long are you gonna be happy with that bump on his nose. I said, "Mama, I don't see any bump." And she said, "That's 'cause love is blind." I'm sorry, Jack. - About what? - Us. The way things went for us. - I am too. - Well, I have lots of goodies for you. Let's see now. We have toothbrush and moisturizer for your elbows. - For my what? - Your elbows. I've been noticing, honey, lately your elbows are getting a little wrinkled. - Oh, hell if that's the case, you might just as soon dip my whole body in it. - Your body is just fine. - No, it isn't just fine, Mary. And it's not just my heart either. - I know. - I wanna talk to you, Mary. Come here and sit beside me, please. You know, I've been doing a lot of thinking lately. And I've come to realize that I let resentments bury me for an awful long time. Sometimes I can't even remember what they were or how they even got started. - We should've taken the risks, Jack. That's my fault. - No, ma'am, you had every right to expect some measure of security. I could've said no. I could've fought harder. But the truth is, I was never very much of a fighter. But I blamed you. I'm very sorry for that. I hope you will forgive me. - I forgive you. - Thank you. We gave our boy a good life. - Yes, we did. - We did. And we're gonna get her back. We owe it to him and his little Christine. We're gonna fight. We're gonna do whatever we must do to get her back. Only this time, we're gonna do it together. - Sit here, I'll get you some coffee. Would you like a cinnamon roll? - No, no thanks, coffee's just fine. How's Mr. Brown doing? - Better, thank you, much better. That man is full of surprises. - How did you get this? - What's that? - You have a confidential file, an F63 2900- - 1544. - Yes, how did you get it? - From the Attorney General's office. - Mr. Brown, the Attorney General just doesn't hand out F- - Well, how do you think I got it? You go through that box and you will find a coroner's report of my son's death, along with some photographs of his body. These are never released without the proper authorization- - Mr. Matthews, if it was up to the government, Dusty Johnson Brown would be spending her life in relative comfort, living off my son's life insurance, Social Security, and marine benefits. Now, I don't trust the government to fix potholes, so why would I trust them to avenge my son's death? Cream and sugar? - No, no, thanks. - And let's get down to business. - Okay. - She's a mighty fine little girl, isn't she? - Yes, yes, she is. - And she ain't scratched at all. - How much you want for her? - Well, she is awful pretty. - How much? - 45. - Sold. - Maybe I should've asked more, 60 maybe. - No, 45 is just fine, thank you, thank you. - You find what you're looking for? - Well, you know, you find bits and pieces, you know. - Let's you and me grab a little chat. - Well, that's okay, I was just on my way out. - Stay there, baby, I'll be right back. - Okay. - That's a mighty pretty little piece of glass you got here. - Yeah, yeah, but you wanna be careful. Don't usually find this quality at flea markets. But sometimes a surprise pops up and- - It'd be kind of like you, wouldn't it? Born and raised right here in Ada, don't you know, so I know everybody who belongs here. If ever there was a man who didn't belong, that man would be you. So now that you found what you are looking for, I think it's time for you to leave. - I don't know, there's some more shopping I'd like to do. - Shops are closed. - I do like to thank you for your hospitality. - You come back and see us real soon, you hear. Let's go. - Mr. Hardley? Yes, this is Mary Brown from Gadsden, Alabama. Well, I'm just fine, sir, thank you. And you? Good. Helen Lansbury of the Birmingham Shelter for Women gave me your number. I am sending you photographs of my daughter-in -aw and my granddaughter for you to post in all your shelters throughout Illinois. Well, no sir, they're not exactly missing. Hello? Chrissy. - Hello? - Yes! Chrissy, stop that! Mrs. Charlene Brown? - Yeah? - I'm Special Agent Warren Matthews of the FBI. I wonder if we can talk? - Chrissy, shut up! You got some ID? - Yeah. - I don't got to talk to you, you know? - That's true, Mrs. Brown, but I think you should know that the Bureau is reconsidering opening the case concerning your husband's death and perhaps if you could satisfy our questions here and now, we wouldn't have to go any further. Thank you. Hi. You could've questioned her all night long. - What did you think she was gonna do, confess? - Well, I tell you something, she had information about that murder before she was questioned, before she saw the body. She never even did see the entire body, so how did she know about his thumb? About the holes in the mattress? - I don't know yet. - Now, here's a man who worked with her at the dog kennel, and he says she used to walk around telling anybody who'd listen how she, quote, "Wished to hell Chris was dead," unquote. How about that? - Well, we haven't got to him yet. Don't know whether we will. - Because you're wasting your time! You're looking at little rocks, you're ringing little doorbells. I'll tell you where the truth is, the truth is in Leavenworth. - Mm-hm. And if I have to, I'll go see Rocky Jackson myself. - You can't do that. - Who's gonna stop me? - What are you gonna do, ask him, "Did Dusty put you up to this," and then when he says no, then what? - I'll go there myself. - When? - Mind if I get a good night's sleep first? - I'd prefer you didn't but if you must. You say, you say Chrissy seemed all right? - She's okay, she's fine. - Thank you. - You're wasting your time, Mr. Matthews. Anything you or anybody else wants to know, you can find it in the court transcripts to my court marshal. I do appreciate that, Mr. Jackson, but you see, since I figured that you were lying throughout that court marshal. It's not much use to me, is it? - Yeah, well, that was the truth. Me and Dusty never spoke about nothing, we never spoke about insurance, we never spoke about nothing. - That's what you said, all right. - It's the truth. - You must love her a lot. - Sure, you ever meet her, you'd know why. Oh, I met her. - What was that? - I met her, sure, I didn't tell you. I spent some time with her and her boyfriend, down there in Ada. - Mr. Matthew, please don't play games with me. Dusty doesn't have any other boyfriend except for me. - Really? I could've sworn... Wait a minute, sure. Yes. Talbot, his name is Talbot. She never mentioned Talbot to you? - I haven't heard much from her lately. - Well, my understanding is, Mr. Jackson, that you haven't heard much of anything from her. - Mr. Matthews, she stood by me at the trial. You saw it. - Yeah, let you take the fall. - She had nothing to do with it! - So, you know nothing about Talbot or Stan? - No, I don't know Stan. - Stan, Stan Reynolds. Marine, she moved in with him right after your trial, even got him to pay her way back to the states. She never told you about him? Rocky, I saw her, I saw her boyfriend. She said you were an overgrown idiot who was obsessed with her. She said her friends kept telling her that you were an embarrassment, that you were like some drooling, lovesick teenager with his brain between his legs. Rocky, she's not gonna call you. She's not gonna wait for you, she's not gonna write. You're as much a victim in this as Chris Brown was. And you're gonna let her get away with it. - What you want me to do, Mr. Matthews? - We're gonna start by writing a letter. Okay? - Here's another one. I'm getting scared, Dusty. You should've kept in touch with that boy, you should've called him, written him. - Oh god. - What? - It says I owe him $15,000 and if I can't pay, he's gonna see I go to jail. - I told you, he needs stroking, that boy, you gotta stroke him. - Shut up! What am I gonna do? - You keep your mouth shut, that's what you do. It's his word against yours and he's a convicted felon. So you just ignore him and you keep your mouth shut. Now, unless you got something better to do, I'd damn well appreciate some lunch. - Why the hell do you put up with him? - This ain't Hawaii, honey. I don't have any more marines chasing after me. At least he's bringing in some disability. How many of those are you sending out? - So far, over 1,000. 1,000? - You know how many shelters there are in this country? We ask that every single one of them is on her list. - And every last one of them is gonna get a letter and a picture. If that woman is dumb enough to leave Oklahoma with Chrissy, and she's pretty dumb, then every shelter and every state in the country's gonna know about it. - What about Rocky? You making any progress with him? - I've had him write three letters. So far there's been no response, but in his last one, I had him tell her to call at a specific time and date. - You think she will? - He's threatening to blow the whole thing wide open. She's gonna call. When she does, Rocky's gonna know what questions to ask her and what to attack her on. The phone's gonna be tapped, we're gonna get her. - Is that a promise, Mr. Matthews? She ain't gonna call. - Relax. - Don't tell me to relax, she was supposed to call 15 minutes ago! She ain't gonna call. - Unclear. One, two, three. Rocky? - Hey, Charlene? - What's the matter, honey, you sound scared? - What did I tell you, I told you to call at seven o'clock sharp! Huh? You think I just wait around the damn phone? Listen, I'm sorry, honey, I just wanna talk. - Well, I'm here, honey. - How come you never come to see me, you know? You never write? - You called me mean nasty things in those letters, Rocky, what the hell do you expect? - Yeah, well, you still love me? - Rocky, you was always an impulsive boy. - Listen, you said you wanted to spend the rest of your life with me, what happened to that? Hm? - Well, maybe if things was different, we could. But as they are, you can't expect me to wait my life out for you. - Then I want my money. What money? - The money you promised me, $15,000, I want! - Rocky, I ain't got no money, don't you understand that? His momma put a hold on everything, everything. - You just used me, didn't you? Rocky. - If you think I'm gonna sit here, honey, and rot my life away, letting you out free as a bird, you're crazy. - Look, there ain't nothing I can do for you in there, nothing at all. Now, you can go to the FBI like you threatened, and tell anybody anything but the fact remains, I can't help you no matter what you threaten. And frankly, honey, who the hell is gonna believe you? - Yeah, yeah, we'll see, we'll see! - Sit down. - You said you'd get her, those were your words. - And we will, we will! - That's not good enough. Good afternoon. - Mrs. Brown, Mrs... What are you gonna do, Mrs. Brown? - $45. Pre-war Lalique signed, and then it gets tossed like a football. - Maybe you shouldn't expect something for nothing. - Aura Lalique. Impossible to find, look. There's an. - I mean, the man's a barbarian. Well, it's no doubt in my mind that your granddaughter is the victim of abuse. If not outright physical abuse, then simple neglect. And I gotta tell you, it was hard sitting there watching her. But the fact is, no matter what our personal opinions are, there's nothing we can do about it. - I don't believe that, Mr. McDaniel. - First of all, you got the laws of Oklahoma. Secondly, you've got a small town that's ready to protect one of their own. Thirdly, you've got a judge who says as long as she stays in Oklahoma, she's got her daughter, clear and legal. As much as I hate seeing that little girl living like that, legally there's nothing I can do to change it. - How much would you charge, Mr. McDaniel, for a kidnapping? - If there's a heaven, this is how I want it to be. I don't even want the fish to bite. - It's nice but a little quiet for me. - This is where I taught Chris how to fish. - Mmm, good fisherman? - Oh, hell yes. In high school, he was a lifeguard out here, you know. - You don't say? - Indeed, saved a boy's life just right over there one day. It's real good to know there's a young man still alive today because of my son. So what are you gonna do about this kidnapping? - I'm gonna do it. - I see. Well, that wife of mine is a mighty persuasive woman. - Oh, I'm not doing it because of your wife. I've seen how that kid is living. Maybe I can help change that. I appreciate that, sir. Sure hope they don't bite this one. - There's only one main road hooking up to the highway, and that's the major artery. And we've got a clean straight line for a good 10 miles. - I'll get it. - Well, once they're on our tail, there's no shaking them. - That's why I think we're better off adding these. It give a choice of three- - Hello? Hi Mary, it's Warren Matthews here. - Yes, Mr. Matthews. - I just wanted to let you know, I'm on a 10:15 flight to Hawaii. - Vacation? Look, I know you're frustrated. - You can't begin to imagine, sir. - Well, actually, I can, that's why I'm going to Hawaii. I think that's where our case rests. I'm just asking for a few more days, be patient. - I thank you for your advice. Final call for flight 108. - They're calling my flight. I'll phone you when I've got some news, all right? - We each have our business to take care of, Mr. Matthews. I may be calling you with news of my own. Goodbye. - Goodbye. - Ready? - Ready. - I wish that I was going with you. - You just do what the doctor says. Chrissy's gonna need her grandpa when we get back. - Yeah, you give this to her and you tell her papa loves her this much. I will. - You be careful, darling. - I love you. - You call me, hear. - Talbot, I ain't sure this is such a good idea. - Look, we show up at my mama's for Christmas, she's gonna give us a check, I know it. We don't show up, she's gonna send us a card. What the hell we gonna do with a card, huh? - I don't like the idea of leaving the state. - Can Bubba come? - Just a couple of days. - Yeah, well you know what could happen. - Huh, mommy? - Don't be stupid. What do you think, they got some idiot parked at the state line gonna arrest you as soon as you cross over? Use your head. - I wouldn't put it past them. - Mommy! - Damn it to hell, shut up about this damn bear or I'm gonna throw it in the fireplace! - She's just a little girl, Talbot. - No Dusty, she's not just a little girl, she's our meal ticket. So far, I ain't seen no meals. - It's legal stuff, Talbot, okay. I told you that, it takes time, it'll come. - All right, take it but stop talking about it. Look, you wanna stay here with your brat, go ahead. I'm going. - Okay. But it better be a big damn check. - What? - Nothing, honey. I'm just trying to figure out what to pack. What are you doing? - Just taking the safety off of it. - Put it away. - Arlo? - Talbot's got a shotgun, never lets it out of his sight. We've got to be prepared for the worst. - You never told me that. - Mrs. Brown, I've had two confrontations with the man. I'm not about to risk another without some protection! - I will not allow guns to be used. - Are you gonna tell Talbot that? - That is my granddaughter in there! I will not having people shooting around my granddaughter! - Arlo. Oh my god. - She's gonna get away from us. - I can't. - Once she's on the road and picks up speed. - I won't! Talbot gets crazy and starts firing that thing, then you're shooting back and Christine is caught in the line of fire. No, I won't allow it. here. We have nothing left. - You did the right thing, Mary. Come on, let's go home. - Ms. Carlo. - You Agent Matthews? - Yes, sir. - Well, Ms. Carlo ain't sure she wants to talk to you. - Is that so? - Look, I'll talk about Dusty but I'm off limits. You got it? - Yes, ma'am. - Good. - He said he'd call if he had any news. - I know but I gotta do something, anything. - You're gonna freeze us to death, Talbot. - What, do you want me to fall asleep, is that it? - No, but a little heat wouldn't hurt. - You wanna drive through this crap, go ahead! Talbot! - Go ahead! - Talbot! - Bitching at me since we left Ada. - You're making me nervous. I don't like you drinking when you- - You what? - Nothing. - You telling me what to do, Dusty? - No, no, I just wish you wouldn't- What! What do you just? - Forget it. - Calm down. - You gotta make a choice, Dusty. You gotta decide if you want it warm in here, or if you want me to stop drinking, or if you want me to quit slapping you! One wish is all you get, Dusty, just one. - You son of a bitch, stop it. Mommy! - You're gonna get the same damn thing. - You leave her alone! Get out. Get, get out! - It's freezing out there! - Get the hell out of here. Take your damn child with you. Go on out, get! - Mommy! - Come on, come on. Damn it, you son of a bitch! - I want her back in time for Christmas. - Mary. - What if she comes home and there's nothing for her under the tree? - Maybe it's us we should be thinking about. - How so? - Well, you know how they say everything happens for a reason? We lost our son, our granddaughter, I damn near lost my life. Yet I think we found each other again through all of this. Maybe that's what we were supposed to do, find each other again. - Everything's gonna be okay, honey. Mama's gonna take care of you. We're gonna be just fine. Christine, honey, look, you gotta stop the crying, okay, baby. Mama ain't gonna let nothing bad happen to you, I promise, I promise, okay. Okay? I love you. Okay, honey, we gotta start walking, okay. - I'm tired. - I know, I know. But we gotta keep moving, okay, can you do that? Huh? - I'm cold. - Baby, there ain't nothing I can do about that. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You gotta do what mama tells you, okay. All right? Now you take my hands, good, and we're gonna walk. And we're gonna find ourselves a town and everything will be okay, all right? I'm tired. I know, I know. I know.

I don't like reading books without pictures, do you? Well, I should say, do you, Bubba? No sir, of course not. Then we're gonna sit here together, the three of us, and we're gonna read all of those books, including the Velveteen Rabbit, and we're gonna start with that one. - Who's he? - Oh, my, my, dear.

I heard about your good news, congratulations. - Thank you. - Let me add a little icing to your cake, we're bringing Dusty in. We're charging her with conspiracy to commit murder. - Thank you, Mr. Matthews. I'll look forward to hearing from you. And Merry Christmas. - To you too, Mary, bye bye. - They're charging her with conspiracy to commit murder. - Oh my. - We're headed for Hawaii. Dusty's going on trial. Time to go! I'm coming. - Chrissy! Oh, there she is. I promise we're gonna get back as fast as we can. Gonna miss you. - You know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna bring back four grass hula skirts, and we're gonna go out back and right out in the open, we're gonna dance the hula and scare all the raccoons out the woods. - That's better. Now, mamaw's gonna be here and Bubba too. I love you, baby. - Chrissy, you ever had fried banana fritters? Well, you're gonna get fried banana fritters until they're coming out your ears. - You never made a fried banana fritter in your life. - They got them frozen down at Piggly Wiggly. - Don't go. - Oh, darling, we do have to go, but we'll be back before you know it. You just remember how much we love you. - Okay. - Put in a word for us, baby. It's not over yet. Mama needs all the help she can get. - Honey, where is this witness room? - It's supposed to be down here. - You satisfied, mother Brown? - Not yet. - Why not? You've destroyed my life, taken my daughter away, turned my friends against me. You've done everything you can to punish me for something I didn't do. What more do you want? - You took my son's future. I want yours. If I can't have your life, I wanna take away your freedom to live it. - Innocent until proven guilty. And you're a long way from proving me guilty. I'm gonna walk out of here and I am gonna wave goodbye as I do. - Now, Mr. Jackson, did there come a time when you were at the enlisted men's club and you saw Dusty in possession of what she said was LSD? - Yes, sir. She said she had some acid she was gonna try to take care of Chris with. Well, what did you take this to mean? - To kill him. Later she told me she put it in a sandwich, she gave it to Chris and he didn't die from it though. - Did she indicate whether she was disappointed? - Yes, sir. She told me she put it in a peanut butter sandwich and it didn't kill the son of a bitch. - Did she ever mention another attempt on his life? - Well, that's when she offer and propositioned me to kill him. What did she say? - She said if I was to kill him, she'd give me insurance money, split it. - Mr. Jackson, after the killing, you returned to Dusty's apartment, isn't that right? Yes, sir. - What was Dusty like when she came home? - She says, you know, "Rocky, you did it." She says, "You killed him." She said, "We ain't gonna have to see him anymore." I said, "You're damn right." - She say anything about money? - She said that as soon as she collected the insurance money, she would give me half. That was it. - Thank you, Mr. Jackson. No further questions. Your witness. - So you lied during your court marshal? When you swore under oath that Charlene Brown had no knowledge or participation in your act against Chris Brown, is that correct? - Yes, ma'am. You lied about your knowledge of any insurance money, is that right? - Yes, ma'am. - And those letters your wrote to Dusty from Leavenworth, those weren't your words at all, were they? Weren't you being instructed by Mr. Matthews of the FBI? - Yes, ma'am. - So those letters were a lie as well. Tell me, Mr. Jackson, can you think of any reason why this court should now believe your testimony? - Because it's the truth, she knows it. - Well, that's great comfort, coming from a devout liar. - Thank you very much. Is it correct, Mr. Matthews, that you interviewed the defendant at her home in Ada, Oklahoma? Yes, sir. - And did you ask her about her testimony at the court marshal of Ralph Rocky Jackson? Yes. - Did you ask her whether she had told the truth when she testified? - Yes, she said she hadn't told the truth about her relationship with Mr. Jackson. - That is a lie! Counselor. - I said to her that our investigation had indicated there were some areas where she didn't appear to have told the truth and she said, "Yes, that's so." - Your Honor, I move to strike that about the investigation. - Overruled. - And then what happened? - I asked her in what other areas had she not been truthful and she just looked at me and didn't respond. She never did respond. Thank you. - Hello? Mary, honey, any news? We're all waiting. Oh. Well sure, I know you must be. Yes, she's here. She's out back with Bubba. Chrissy, Chrissy, honey, it's your nanny. - Nanny, papaw! - Here she is now. Oh, she's so excited. - Nanny? - Hi, sweetheart, nanny loves you. Papaw sends you a big kiss. - Nanny, guess what? What? - Bubba got a new girlfriend. What? - Her name is Lulu. - Bubba's too young to have a girlfriend! - They wrestle. - Wrestle? Let me talk to mamaw. - Here. - Honey, they're gonna have the cutest puppies. - So when she called you, she seemed to have information regarding your son's murder, information that had not yet been released? - Objection, hearsay. - Sustained. Getting back to August 19th, prior to your son's death. You received a phone call from the defendant? - That's correct, she called about the pending divorce. - Did you say anything to her about the custody of your granddaughter? - Yes, I told her that Chris would receive sole custody of Chrissy. And what did she say? - What I most remember her saying is that she would see Chris dead before he got custody. - That is a lie! - Sit down! - That whole thing is a lie. - Miss Collins, instruct your client to calm down. - She threatened me. She threatened me right from the start! She threatened me! She was jealous! She was jealous because Chris loved me and not her. You are a damn liar! That's enough. Bailiff, this court now stands in recess. In other words, everything Rocky Jackson said on this stand is a lie. - That's right, yes, sir. Objection. - Overruled. - And your roommates, Patti and Sandra? - Lied. They both lied. - You're the only one in this whole trial who's been telling the truth. Your honor, counsel is badgering the witness. Overruled. - Yes. - They're all liars? - They're all out to get me. She paid them. Ask her. Ask her! - Thank you very much. - Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, have you reached a verdict? - We have, your Honor. - Please hand the verdict to the bailiff. Will the defendant please rise? In the case of the United States of America versus Charlene Dusty Brown, on count one, conspiracy to commit murder, the jury finds the defendant guilty. On count two, second degree murder, the jury finds the defendant guilty. The bailiff will take the defendant into custody. - I wish Chris could see this. I want to hold him in my arms and tell him, "You can rest now." Mama and daddy have taken care of everything. - Oh, that's my girl. Kick forward now, there you go. Kick forward. - Bubba! Oh, look at you! - Thank you, dear. - Oh my, oh my goodness. Oh, papaw, she's getting so big, she's not gonna need us anymore. Kick your feet out when you go forward. Wanna go higher? - Now, reach for the sky! To the sky! Reach for the sky. Kick your legs forward, look at that! All by herself, now, look at that. Isn't that something or what? Oh, my, my, my. Are you ready to give grandpa a push?
