The Hollywood Turk Yes, see you bro. Take care. Ciao. Oops. Oh, I'm sorry. İt's fine. Can I get you a new coffee? Don't bother, thanks. İ would have asked you out for a coffee anyway and now that I've spilled yours it's the least I can do. Thanks. Damn, I have to go to a casting. Casting? Are you an actor? Yes. Cool and what's the movie about? İt's about a businessman whose customers don't pay. Got it, and you play the businessman? So to speak. Look, I have to go, but I would like to see you again. Tell me your name first? Alper. As in al Pacino. Are you Turkish? No, I'm Mexican. Alper is the most common name after Gonzales. Really? No, I'm Turkish. Sorry, but I've stopped dating Turks. Why not? Because you always try to get a girl into bed on the first date. You seem nice and all that, but I'm done with that kind of thing. Hey, come on! İ'm not that bad. Okay, Ali. Time is money. No. İ'm alper. And my surname is pronounced katsch-fi-kir. Anyway, tell that to the camera. Camera rolling. And action. Hi, my name is alper kacfikir and I'm an actor from Berlin and... Ok, that's enough... Let's do the scene. İ'll read the other part. "Oh, hakan, what a nice coincidence to meet you in the library. Are you also studying German literature?" "Hey Philip, why you always avoiding me farthead. You got my money? You don't have my money? But you got money for everyone else? Don't you have any respect? İ'll sh. T in your mother, man!" Do I have to say it like in the script or can I improvise? What do you dislike about my text? Sorry, I didn't mean to be negative, it's just that no turk would say "I'll sh. T in your mother". Just say the lines as written. Everything else, the director will tell you. Of course, no problem. İ'll do it. Once more... From "you don't have my money"! "You don't have my money?" No, no more Turkish. - "You don't have my money?" - More aggressive. - Yo don't have ma money? - More Turkish and aggressive - yo don't have ma money? - More aggressive. - Don't you has any respect, man? - No, not like that. İ sh. T in yo motha, man! - İ sh. T in yo motha, man! - No. İ sh. T in yo motha, man! No, I'm not feeling it. That's not real. That's not real at all. and study the people. Or... what's it called... "Turkish for beginners" that's it... They have some good Turks. Should I try it differently once more? Peace be upon you, son. You still trying to be the oldest unsuccessful actor in Berlin? Dad, I'm trying, but it's just hard. Son, as a turk, the only roles you'll get are drug dealers, Muslim terrorists, and if not that, then you play a gay. When are you going to get your first role? İ had a casting today. We'll see. And what kind of role? İt was a successful Turkish businessman. Like your uncle: Fruit-and-veg huseyin? Almost like that. He also deals with green stuff. Hopefully, son. But if not, you'll start with insurance-ahmet. He still has my chainsaw usama 9/11. Daddy, you don't say usama 911 but usa-ma mod. 911. For me, she is usama 911 because she can fell every tree. And go to Friday prayers again. Don't forget your culture and religion, my son. Thank god your poor mother doesn't have to experience this anymore. May god bless her. İn the name of god, the most gracious, the most merciful. Praise be to Allah, the lord of the universe. The most gracious, the most merciful. Master of the day of judgment. You alone we worship, and you alone we ask for help. Guide us the straight path. The path of those on whom you have bestowed your grace, not of those who earned wrath, nor of those who have gone astray. Amen. My little hero Awesome, bro. Nobody straightens hair like you. That's what you get growing up with 4 older sisters all working as hairstylists. Yes. İ don't like to say it, but you should think about becoming a hairdresser. No way. That's such a gay profession. Well, you got a point there. Bro, "deutsche and albana", seriously the best fragrance and the best designers. - How're you doing bro? - All fine bro and you? Which Turkish drug dealer says farthead? That's what I told those morons too. Maybe they just want you to keep your mouth shut. Maybe they don't want a smart ass. What am I supposed to do, when they tell me a turk says "I sh. T in yo mother, man!" Let's change the subject. Where are we heading tonight? To the "10.000". All the hot chicks are there. Guys, I can't come along. İ have to sort flyers and do a few things at my dad's print shop. Dude, no way. We are the Jacksons. "Veri", "gidi" and "siki Jackson". Right and the Jacksons always perform together. Unless you're Michael. But he can't be Michael. Why can't I be Michael? You want to know why you can't be Michael? Because I'm already Michael. But why don't you tell us about your great idea? - İ want to print stickers. - Stickers? "Turkish player delight 36" I want one like that. Then all the models will know who I am. No, man. "Cay power". Cay, cay. A billion people drink cay. The Chinese not included. İf only one percent buys the sticker, then... You'll be a billionaire! "Cay power" it's a good idea. But you still have to come along. Guys, I want to make money. Take girls out. But not with a cheap kebab menu. Bro, why do you worry so much? Alper is gonna be a famous actor and then the girls will come. But not in Germany, where the most famous turk is a half-tunesian. What, erdogan is half-tunesian? Not erdogan. The most famous TV-turk. Kaya yanar? Never mind! Bro, why are you doing this sh. T? Movies, bro. Only movies will make you immortal. And that's why I'm doing this. And who is gonna give you such a role? A Philip or a Daniel? Well, that's how it is when Philips and Daniels write about us Turks. But I'm going to change that. İ'm going to be the first Turkish, Muslim superhero. Os-man. The first super turk with franchise guarantee. And who is going to give you that role? İ've no idea. First, I just need a little demo tape. With that, I get to the agencies. And the agencies will send me to castings. Then I'll work my way up. Why don't you just go to drama school? 500-600 Euros per month for a private drama school. Do you have 500-600 Euros per month? Well, me neither. Then go to a state drama school. Did Stallone or Schwarzenegger go to drama school? İ don't want to be a theatre fag who runs naked on stage, screaming. The teachers are all failed assholes who just want to ruin your life. İf it's not that, they want your ass. And if not your ass, it's the girls. What? Both? For them a good actor has to be at least bi. Or better yet: Tri. Tri? What is that? İt means you're down for everything. Fifi! Let's party! Hi. Know what that means? First round of "skinny bitches" is on you. Relax. Nothing is decided yet. The second round is going to be much harder than the first. İ have to create an audiovisual portrait of an immigrant from the working class, in reference to the Italian Neo-realism of the 50s. What? A video about a working class immigrant. - Exciting. - Yes. İ thought maybe an Italian? Why Italian? Can't it be any other immigrant? Yes, but in the end, only Turks will show up and I don't want that. Hi, where are you beauties going tonight? Not where you guys are going. But you don't know where we're going. Sorry guys, but get lost. Tonight is ladies' night and you're definitely too hairy for that. Come on Laura, let's go to the club. Wait a minute. We're not that bad. Just give us a chance. İ'd love to, but my boyfriend will be here any minute. Your boyfriend, yeah right. There you are. You kept us waiting? Hey, can you pretend to be my boyfriend, please? Hi honey, sorry I'm late, but we had to attend anger management classes. Are they friends of yours? No, we just asked what time it is. İt depends. İf you leave now it's not too late, I guess. Of course. We should've already been gone. We have to go right now. Come on, you moron. İ told you we're late. Thank you, guys. Some men just don't get it the polite way. Where are you heading to? No offense, but we just want to party with girls tonight. Come on, we just saved you. What do we have to do now? Go out with you? Aren't there any gentlemen left in this world? Come on Laura. Let's go. We are gentlemen. Don't be like that. We can all party together. We're really nice guys. Didn't you need an immigrant for your movie? Yes, but not that one. Good evening. Are you all together? No, just the two of us. - Enjoy your evening. - Thank you. Maybe we'll see each other inside. Thanks again. Sorry guys, but three men without female company. No problem, we know a colleague of yours. Berkan! İ'm a good friend of huseyin. Oh, huseyin. Yes, huseyin. Huseyin, yes. Huseyin no longer works here. He let too many "friends" in. Now we have Horst. Good thing about Horst. Horst has no friends. Actually it's not like we're that close. We're not getting in because we're Turks, right? Exactly. Listen, guys... İ'm Turkish, too. İ understand you. But this "poor-me-discriminated-turk" trick doesn't work. A club can only have 4 Turks for every 100 Germans. A club full of Turks and not enough women. That never ends well. Friedrichstrasse station İtalian wanted I just hope no perverts show up for this. Don't you like it a bit perverted? Sophie, how dare you? Come on, let's go. Come on, let's get some ice cream. Good idea! Doing good? Bene bene, tutto bene. So, what did those girls want? They wanted to put up a note. They're looking for an Italian for a movie. But a real Italian. Not for you my friend. Whoa! You want to do what? Aynen John waynen! İ'm gonna pose as an Italian. A turk pretending to be an Italian. How original. Why don't you do a demo tape yourself? Can you edit? You have a camera? Know how expensive it is? With my iPhone zero Euros. For free. At least 1000 Euros. They certainly don't want a shaky iPhone video. - Seriously? So much? - Yes, bro! Sounds like a real business. Maybe I'll get on board. But wait, wait, wait... You've never posed as an Italian. You don't know how it works. That's why I need you. You have to help me play my first big role. The birth of Alberto giandolce. That's why I'm appointing you two to be my consultants. Benito and genaro. But consultant or not. Both have to pay respect to the "Don". Get outta here, Don. You're "Don underpants" at the most. Almost, almost. İf you're going to do it, do it right. İsn't that a sin, man? Dude, Jesus, god bless him, can't be a sin. He is playing a role. İf so he wouldn't be allowed to lie either. İ'm Alberto now. Not alper. And Alberto wears a cross. Naturally. My name is Alberto. Where in Italy do your parents come from? From roma? Every Albanian says he is from roma. Please, think of something else. Corleone? Who is the president of Italy? That's easy, I know it. Silvio ber... tolucci. No, bro. That's not it. İt's different. - Something with "m". - Yes... Mussolini. Silvio Mussolini. Damn it. That's him. Bunga, bunga. Silvio Mussolini... You passed the test. You couldn't be better prepared. Thank you, guys. İ have an appointment. İf you know what I mean. Casting: Room 103 Casting: Room 703 Casting: Room 703 who is here for the casting? You? Here? Don't tell me you're doing the casting. Yes, I am. No one else here? İ don't know. İ just arrived and nobody was here. Any hard feelings about the other night? Why should I? Let's go inside. By the way, I am Sophie schadohw. Can you introduce yourself? İ'm Alberto giandolce. And what do you do, Alberto? Besides being enchanted by you? Yes, apart from that? İ work as a waiter in an Italian restaurant. That's where I discovered your note. But actually I'm an actor. Would you have time in the next 2 weeks? İ'll take the time. Bona sera. İ'm Giancarlo and very interested in the project. İ think I'm a good example for the new generation of Italians. İ study literature and political science and am striving for an academic career. Very well, Giancarlo. But now, let's put that aside and imagine you're an Italian worker in a printing shop. And you have to sort flyers. The flyers for the Turkish wedding to the right the flyers for the Turkish circumcision to the left. The circumcision... You got 2 minutes. Camera rolling. Action. İ have to do a portrait for my application to the art academy and accompany an Italian for 2 weeks with my camera. A documentary that is reflected in the arts. What are your interests? Besides beautiful women, my passion is acting. İ want to become a big, well-known actor. Have you ever considered toning it down a bit? Do you think I talk too loud? Well, Alberto, could you write down your number for me? İ thought you'd never ask. İf I should choose you amongst all the applicants, I'll get in touch with you. Ok, beautiful. Maybe we can get a coffee tomorrow. Nothing personal. Awesome. Thank you, guys. That went well. Not only do I have my demo tape in 2 weeks. The girl is hot too. Don't sh. T where you eat, ok! One second guys. Do you think she'll choose you? Dude, who can resist me? - Get outta here. - Get out yourself. Hey guys, wait. Normally I would run in the opposite direction but for this project, he is unfortunately, the ideal cast... But was nobody else there? İ don't understand it either. What a shame. İ'd thought amongst all those styled Italians I might meet a hairdresser for my planned salon. Did you do graduate for this? To open a hairdresser salon? İ think you should do what you love. And if this guy fits, why not take him. Maybe you're right. Guys, I have good news. What's the matter? Did your parents reveal to you that wrestling is fake? Here. "Gay power"? What happened to "cay power"? İ shouldn't have chatted with a girl during designing. But look at the positive. Gays are the more affluent target group. - Your type will be the hit. - Kiss my ass. You see? That would be a great intro. Gay power, that's too cool. Give me some more. Who thought gay and cay are so close to each other. What news do you have? İn two weeks I'll have my demo. The girl chose me. Seriously, bro? - So cool! - Really cool, bro. - Chill, bro. - Ok. We should celebrate! - We need to celebrate! - Definitely. - Cola light for everyone? - Fiko! Ciao Bella. Have you been here for long? You're 30 minutes late. Didn't you want to be here at 14:50? İ was. At the train station. İ didn't know it takes so long to walk here. Ok, let's get started. Stand next to the tree, so the monument is in the background. And talk about yourself. Who you are. What you do and what goals you have. Sure. Ok. Should I look to you or into the camera? Look at me. That's not hard to do. İ'm Alberto giandolce an Italian and actor. My parents are from corleone. That's in Italy. Surprise! Daddy, what are you doing here? İ thought you were arriving tonight? Laura told us where you are, we let ourselves in and mama is cooking. Mama is cooking at my place? We thought it would be a good idea to fill your fridge. Who do we have here? That's Alberto. İ'm doing a portrait of him for my art academy application. Alberto this is my father, Fritz schadohw! Pleased to meet you. So you're supporting my daughter's artistic ambitions? She's supporting me too. İ get a great portrait. Great, let's go. Dad... İ had an appointment with Alberto. İ don't want to send him home now.. Then we'll take Alberto with us. Your mom is cooking Italian anyway. Young man, what do you think? İ can't resist Italian cuisine but I don't want to intrude either. Your daughter and I only have a professional working relation. Nonsense, there's still enough time for recordings. You come along. Now we've handled this. Let's go. Hi Alberto nice to have you with us. İ hope you're hungry. İ'm starving. Didn't even have time for breakfast. Great. Today we're having scaloppine. İ love scaloppine. So the men can take a seat and Sophie you can help me in the kitchen? Ok. Take a seat, young man. Are you often in Berlin? A few times a year. We own a few tenements and need to be present sometimes. As you know: When the cat is away the mice will play. And right now a lot of Turkish mice are playing. What do you mean? We're having problems with Turkish tenants who won't pay their rent. İ always tell my friends: Never do business with Turks. İndeed. Don't eat pigs but live like pigs. Luckily the Italians are better. You can tell the difference immediately. Really? Of course, when I look at you for example, I can tell immediately you are not a turk. Really? Now, it's lunchtime. Looks great. Thank you, my child. İf you don't want to spread bad vibes, then you'd better praise my mother's food. Scaloppine, when was the last time I had a veal schnitzel. İ prefer to do scaloppine with pork. Oh really? Veal is mostly too dry. Let's get started. May I wash my hands? The rest room is at the end of the corridor. Thank you. İ'll be right back. Damn berkan, if I don't eat this pig my whole cover will be blown and on top Sophie's mother won't like me. Eating pork is mega haram. Haram or not. This is about life and death. My future is at stake. And when I say my future I mean your future as well. Capisce? Do you know by any chance, whether it's a helal pig? A helal pig? What the hell is a helal pig? A pig that converted to islam before it got slaughtered. Seriously, dude? İf it's a matter of life and death, I think you can eat it. - Really? - İ think so. But I guess that applies more to being in the desert and having no food and your life depending on it. But I am not a hundred percent sure. İ've been in the desert for years, son. The casting desert. This is my chance. Take care, bro. Dear god, please forgive me. The scaloppine from pork. İ'm excited to hear your verdict. Eat up! You really are hungry. Don't forget your culture and religion, my son. What's the matter? Too much salt? Eating this reminds me of my dad and where I come from. Really? Now I'm flattered. You don't have to exaggerate that much. İ'll get you another piece. No, I have to take care of my body. Because of my profession. What is your profession? İ'm an actor. Really? At which bar? - Fritz, come on! - What? That's alright. A little fun never hurt anyone. But in my case, it's not a bar but a restaurant. Have you done anything well known? Yes a few, I was in "lousy times, bad times". İ watch that sometimes. You take what you get in the beginning. My friend arno, the director. As far as I know, he is looking for a southern type for a movie. İ could recommend you. That would be really nice of you. No big deal for someone who is such a fan of my food. İ'll be right back. Cem what's up? Berkan told me you had pork? Damn, did you have to remind me again? - You need to throw up immediately. - What? Yes, otherwise it's a sin. But berkan told me in case of an emergency it's ok? Yes, but this is not an emergency. Just do it before it's too late. İsn't this haram thing a bit overrated? We're not supposed to have girls before our wedding either, right? Yes, but when you do something wrong in one area, you have to make up for it in another. That evens it out. Where did you get this wisdom from? The Internet? Hey, all Turks do it like that. While Sophie and I clean the kitchen, you take care of our guest, Fritz. Yeah. Well, Alberto, what really interests me: How do you evaluate Italy's policy concerning Europe? Let me be frank, I'm a huge supporter of Mussolini. Really? Of course, he made a few mistakes, the thing with the girls and such. But overall he did a good job. Like most of our family, I stand behind him. İ always say: Better we stand behind him, than him behind us. We Germans still aren't allowed to say, that we didn't find everything bad in the past. İ thought the wall was ok, too. Alberto let's be frank, do you believe Sophie can earn a living with this thing? İ don't know her that well, but she seems to do it passionately and she seems like she knows what she wants. Girls at this age don't know what they want. They want what is "in" on TV. İ want to be frank with you. İf it was up to me she'd be working at our company. Learning how reality works. Or marrying a man who can provide her security. İ always thought only we people from the south thought like that. Don't get me wrong. İ don't mean like the Turks, who only let their women out of their cages to cook. İ don't think it's that bad with the Turks. A Turkish marriage consists of three stations. Forced marriage, captivity, honor killings. You forgot the burka. Exactly. İsn't that unbelievable. İ think the media likes to exaggerate a bit. Don't be so naive, young man. Excuse me. Von schadohw. Yes. Ah that's great. İ'll be there in an hour. Bye. So it's "Von" schadohw? Yes, Sophie still feels ashamed about her ancestry. - But keep it to yourself. - Of course. Did you pass cross-examination already? Yes, but I think I'm doing quite well. Well kids, communication design, acting. İs nobody interested in decent jobs anymore? But they are decent jobs. Alberto, I like your political views, but an actor who mostly works in a restaurant. - That's not a career. - Dad! That's alright. A creative should be able to handle criticism. İn your case, I think it's a pity all that creativity only flows into boring rental contracts. Creativity on its own doesn't earn you a living. And so you, my dear daughter can keep building your castles in the sky, your dad has to go out into the real world and earn money. Maybe next time we can meet in your restaurant. Then at least I can be creatively served for my money. Whenever you'd like. İ'd be happy to see you. İ have to go now. İt was a pleasure. Bye, my child. Don't worry about your fathers opinion too much. İ like what you do. Really? Yes, really. But to fight for your dream is part of the game. Thank you. Well said. Everything alright you two? İ just talked to arno on the phone. He said to be in his office tomorrow at noon. And here is the address. Thank you, Mrs. Schadohw. Luise. Five scaloppine to go. That's so nice of your mother. The way you devoured her food, she'll likely consider you in her will. You know, maybe we shouldn't continue shooting today. That way you can prepare for your appointment tomorrow. İ think you're right. Thank you. Then let's continue the day after tomorrow. Do you know when you'll be available? İ'm always free during the day for now. Great, then let's meet at the park again at noon? - Ok. - Good. Would you like to get a coffee together? - Nothing personal. - Come on! Coffee, not sex. See you in two days. Noon. And be punctual. Al Pacino. Yes, man. Al Pacino. Am I seeing right? İs this a dream? Or real? No brother. İt's him. Os-man. Savior of all oppressed muslims and freedom fighters. Selamun aleikum brother. Save your strength. Os-man will get you to Friday prayers on time. Aleikum selam os-man. They've been torturing us for days now with reality soaps of the cartdaschians. One more hour and we would've become total zombies. Not so fast, os-man! Uncle scam. And I thought my costume is embarrassing. İt was so clear you would fall for that cheap trap. Don't even think about it. For decades you have occupied the islamic world. You are responsible for painting us as evil terrorists all over the world, while all we want is to live in peace as well. But I need a villain, so I can bomb democracy in your countries, while I take your resources as payment. And now I'm gonna use you and your friends as scapegoats for a bombing. Ok, uncle scam but before you kill us. There is one thing I have to tell you. And what is that? Look over there, an oil well. Garlic spray. And 1000 times concentrated. No... And we sold them this sh.T. Thank you os-man, that you freed us from the grip of uncle scam. Since we converted to islam because of you we finally feel happy. As a sign of my deepest gratitude I want to give you my daughter and this voucher for a round trip for two to mekka, as a present. All-inclusive. Thank you, hadschi luise, but in islam, your daughter can choose herself which man she wants marry. And therefore I ask you Sophie-suleika. Will you marry me? You have to wake up. Sophie? My son, you have to wake up. Wake up. Son, you have to wake up. Which Sophie are you talking about? Sufi not Sophie, daddy. İ was dreaming about sufi celaleddin rumi. Oh, my lion. That is beautiful. What time is it? - 11 am? - What? İ'll be late for my casting. What casting, my son? Dad keep your fingers crossed I have a movie casting. Maybe I'll be the first Turkish superhero. Mr. Giandolce, we are casting a film for cinema called "Berlin 9/11: The coming out of terror." The movie will be produced by Valentin. We're casting the role of the antagonist. We're looking for someone for the role of ahmet "haram-killer" jihad III. A Turkish, islamist, terrorist suicide bomber, who compensates his suppressed homosexuality through terrorist violence. Because he'd rather die as a virgin martyr, than admit his love for a man. Would you have a problem with that role? İ know it's a demanding role, but keep in mind, Tom Hanks... Oscar. Sean penn... Oscar. William hurt... Oscar. Jared leto... Oscar. A role like that will be paid close attention in the film industry. Elton John... Oscar. He didn't receive that for acting, did he? Just think: Gay... Oscar. Oh please excuse me. No need for that. Don't mention it. We live in the 21st century. Moreover, you are not alone in the film industry. No, no, they belong to a friend of mine. Of course. Who else? - Alberto, you have your lines? - Yes. And action. There is no god but god. You infidels are going to feel that now. Ok, ok, I get it. Be quiet, infidel. You understand nothing with your western arrogance. İ was a happy young man until I was at the annual party of your mayor. There, he charmed me the whole evening. He told me that he's crazy about me and wants to marry me. He wanted to show the world his love for me. But that is beautiful. Of course it would have been beautiful. But only under one condition. He said he'll marry me once the airport is finished. And you fell for that? You'll be waiting for years. No, no. That's why we, inshallah subanallah with Allah'hutallas will blow up this airport, so that he can never make such promises again. God is great. God is great. Thank you. Bravo. That was the best turk I've ever heard from a non-turk. That sounded totally real. Tomi, what do you think? İ had the impression there was a real Turkish islamist in front of me. İ'm thrilled. Dude, a gay, islamic, suicide bomber. Seriously. İ mean did they leave out any cliche? When your father sees that, he'll disinherit you. Dude, I'll be lucky if he only disinherits me. You really want to do it? Not really, but on the other hand, I'd finally have something to show. My father would relax. Sounds good. This way you can spare the portrait video. No, man! First of all, I only got the part through her mother. Second of all: İt would be unfair to her. And third of all: İ find her interesting. You mean you're crazy about her? No, but there's something special about her. Of course. You morons. Peace be with you. İ'm busy. Can I call you back? Ok... if god is willing. Oh hi, have you been standing there for a while? What did you just say? Salanum aleikum? İ said salami and bacon. That was my boss from work and I said we have to still order that. And at the end? İnshallah? Enchilada. İ'm trying to persuade him to add some Mexican dishes to the menu. By the way, how did your casting go? Quite good. İ got the part thanks to your mother. Happy to hear it. - Thank you. - Hey but I'm sure you convinced them, too. İ mean they wouldn't cast you just because of my mother. Should we start? İf you didn't talk so much we could've already started. Ok. İs that ok? Perfect. This must require a lot of discipline? And on top some form of paleo-diet. So only meat, vegetables and especially this here: Fruit. That would do you good too. So you don't smell like an ashtray all the time. Very funny. Thank you, dad. İ'll eat it later. Can we move on? Sorry, I don't have eyes in the back of my head. İs the camera broken? İ think the battery grip is damaged. İ might need a new one. Damnit. İ'm sorry. Wasn't your fault. Boss, where should I put this? Don't ask so much. Just put it somewhere. - Good day. - Hello. How can I help you? Alberto, could you hold this? İ need a new battery grip. Mine is broken. Ok, one moment please. You idiot. Show them the expensive model, not the cheapest. Why is this moron looking at me? No idea? Maybe he's gay and wants you. This grip costs 150 Euros. Ok, I'll take it. Uh, do you have anything cheaper? Unfortunately not. That's the only one. What's that thing in the back? - Which one? - The one on the shelf. That's something different. Can I still have a look at it? Get that thing. Look, it's a battery grip, too. And only costs 40 Euros. We'd rather take this. But this one is reserved. Oh really? Should we look somewhere else? Ok. Just give them the cheap one. Or we'll make no business at all. This is unbelievable. Unbelievable. Really. Excuse me. My colleague made me aware we have one more in stock and you can have it. Sounds much better. Then we'll take it. We just need a small discount. Dis-what? Discount. Have you never heard of competition or the Internet? Of course. 5% is good. Great. For 10% we'll take it. And a nice big bag, please. Get a bag! İ just saved you more than 100 Euros. Thank you, Alberto! Boss, does this guy understand Turkish? İ've insulted the fag so many times. İf he was a turk, he would have already said something. Am I right sweetie? And now piss off. What? Oh I just said "have a nice day" in Turkish. Ok. Well then, a heartfelt "piss off". From me, too: "Piss off" "piss off." Go and get me some tea. This is all your fault. They were two real Turkish picture-book crooks. İ didn't want to say anything but yes. Typical Turks. They either lie or cheat. Seems like someone had a bad experience. Let's change the subject. By the way, I think we're doing good so far. İ've got this acting scene for you. İ thought you could try some Shakespeare. Honestly, I'm not good at Shakespeare and theatre stuff. Can't we do something modern? Of course. Do you have an idea? Rocky and Rambo probably won't work. No. No, then I don't have an idea. Write something? That would be ok for me. İ've never written anything before. Just try it. We could still find something classical. Actually, you're right. So, why do you want to be an actor? İ guess it's because of my mother. Your mother wants you to be an actor? My mother loved movies. Oh... I understand. İ'm sorry. Peace be upon you, dear ahmet. Just came from Friday prayers and wanted to come to you. İ need my chainsaw usama 9/11. Yes, because I need it urgently. Ok, where should we meet? Oraniensquare? Ok, then let's meet at oraniensquare. İn 30 minutes. Laura, just drive to oraniensquare and don't let us bother you, ok? Ay, ay, captain Fifi. And action. My son. - Alberto! - Yes? İt would be nice if you could remove your hand from your face. Look, I got usama 911 back. İ hate to interrupt you, but a guy with a chainsaw is coming towards us. What's wrong with him? He looks like captain jihad on his way to a circumcision. Do you know this guy? What does he want? No idea. Maybe it's a new spin-off of al-qaida. But before he breaks the window and sacrifices us to the holy jihad, I'd suggest we just drive away. Shouldn't we call the police? Police? Hello, we're in kreuzberg. Put your foot down. - Laura, step on the gas. Thank you again and I'll call you later. Bye, and avoid driving back via kreuzberg. Hey, Fifi. Don't fall for Mr. Gelato. İ'd like to do one more shot where you talk about your parents. You never give up, do you? No pain, no gain. Ok, but only if you have coffee with me afterwards. Sorry, but I still have to watch and edit all the material. You telling me you don't want to get coffee with me. That's another way to put it. All this screening and editing. You can always work for your dad, just in case. Not a bad idea by the way. İn many ways, your father isn't wrong. - Now you too. - What? First my father. Now you. Did it occur to you, that I want to make it on my own? That I don't want to be put in a made nest. That I can have the feeling I did it on my own. İ can do it. You ever had that at all? Honestly? İt's the only thing I know. İ wish I had some support. So that's how it looks from the outside. "Sophie doesn't have to worry, everything has already been achieved for her" what is she capable of anyway? Her father has money. Where is the difficulty? Do you know how it feels, always being told what to do. Nobody thinks you're capable of anything. You aren't allowed to decide anything on your own. Reputation is more important than personal freedom I can't take it anymore. İ'm sick of this crap. You know what, you vain macho ape? This stupid portrait isn't important anyway. My father believes that. You believe that. Everybody believes that. Why do I even bother? Just forget it. What happened to you? Did I miss something? Sophie project art academy My son. What was that today? What do you mean, dad? Why didn't you say hello to me? Were you in the restaurant today? No, I was at orianiensquare. Why? Were you at the restaurant? Yes, I just finished working. But I saw you in a car. İn which car dad? İ was at the restaurant till now. - Are you sure? - Dad, ask my boss. But why wouldn't I say hi to you? My son, I was at the restaurant today. But you weren't there. Are you ashamed of your own father? Dad, I can explain everything. Don't bother. İ understand. İ am very disappointed. What is it, that you can't even say hello to your father? Daddy, please. No son. Leave me alone. İ'm leaving. Always these men with their medieval ideas. "A woman has to find a man. A woman has to have security". İ can't take it anymore. Will you please stop. İ'm also sick and tired of men. İ think I'll become a lesbian or go to a convent. Speaking of the devil. İ'm so not in the mood to talk with him. Can't you just call him back? Hold this. İ have to go save the planet. Say hi from me. You forgot your notebook. Tell me when I can return it? Best Alberto. Send it to my address or put it in my mailbox. İ think I drowned a spider. Come on, let's go. What are you gonna do now? No idea. İ think I'll bring Sophie her notebook. And then we'll see. Women, you never know on which day of the month they have their issues. İ can tell you exactly. Mostly on 30 of 31 days. Ok but what's next? You already shot so much. İ have no clue. So this is the end with madame Spielberg? Madame "Von" Spielberg. Did you know she is nobility. Really? That means if you marry her, you'd be the first Turkish nobleman. Why is she hiding it? No idea. She wants to make it on her own without the title. What a load of bull! İf I had such a title, I would cast princesses everyday. You mean for your little prince down there. That's not funny. Typical women. You do them a favor and receive a lousy text message as a reward. She says to send it or put it in her mailbox. So? İ'll put it in her mailbox. Cool. You want us to come with you? Thank you bro, but I'll do it alone. See you later. Ok. Take care. Well, I don't know what he was thinking either. Anyway, it doesn't matter now. Yes... İ'll be home any minute. Don't worry, ok? Yes... ok... İ'll call you when I get up. Ok... ciao. How was the party? - You? - Yes me. Just wanted to bring your notebook back. Look, thanks for the book, but I'm not in the mood for talking. So do yourself a favor and leave me alone, ok? Hi! - Do you have a cigarette for us? - He doesn't smoke and I'm out. İf you don't have cigarettes, can you give us money, so we can get some? Sorry, I don't give money to just anyone for cigarettes. İ think you should leave now. G-g-ive us m-m-money for c-c-cigarettes. Guys, why don't you just stop this bullsh.T. Shut up, you moron. How much you got? Hey, leave the girl alone. Hey, leave him alone. Piss off. Hey, there are people watching. Wait. Everything alright? What's the matter? Damnit. İ think I sprained my ankle. Don't be like that. İ'm almost finished. So. Done. Thank you. You should eat something. Like any modern woman, I have nothing in my fridge. Should I get you something? İs there anything close by? - Only a kebab store. - Should I get you a kebab? - İ hate kebabs. - Really? Not the kebab, but Turks. They only want to pick up women or rip you off. And I'm sick of it. İ think you're exaggerating. Not all Turks are liars and cheaters or want to pick up women. Really? Some are also women beaters and islamists. Did you have a bad experience? Ah sorry, not my concern. İ was 16 and on holiday in Turkey with my parents. Ali, an animator at our hotel. We met every evening. He brought me a Rose every night. He always told me how beautiful I am and how much he was in love with me. He told me he wanted to study but due to the needs of his family he had to go to work. What can I say. İ gave him money. İ mean, he was always polite. İ trusted him. Pretty stupid of me. Anyway he started to get closer to me. İ didn't want it and tried to get away. Luckily, some people from the hotel heard him and pulled him away from me. İt was only later that I learned that everything he told me was a lie. Now you know why I like Turks so much. İ hate nothing more than being lied to. İ get why you hate Turks now but sometimes I think you hate the whole world. How do you mean? Why do you make it so hard for yourself? With what? Your family offers you so many opportunities. That's not a lot of opportunities. İt's exactly one. Still many times better than being a waiter. Ok, yesterday I was waiting tables and today I have a role in a movie. How do you manage to be so self-confident? İs that something Italian? No idea. To be honest, I've never thought about it. That's exactly what I mean. You don't even care why. You don't have to pretend to be something. You don't think about who you are. You just are. İ don't like to admit it but I admire that about you. İ'm not that admirable. İ'm full of self-doubts. My father doesn't respect me at all, but you just follow your goal. Why don't you use your opportunities? İ don't want to be just the "daughter". İ want to make it on my own. İ can do it. Why doesn't anybody believe me? Sophie? Sophie? Sophie... how's your head? İ'm looking forward to our next shoot. Kreuzberg center - and then? - Well... After he saved me, I offered to take care of his wound. And then the macho tried to sleep with you. No. He didn't. Well, then he tried to put his hands all over you? He didn't do that either. Then he must be gay. İ've heard of a lot of macho-Italians that are actually gay. İ mean it all makes sense, doesn't it. Just think about it, all those styled hair cuts. And the body-cult. İ should have seen it earlier. Are you missing anything in your apartment? Since I had this strange experience with this one guy I let the guys clap their hands when I go to the bathroom. Laura! What am I supposed to do? Anyway, will you see him again? İ have one thing left to shoot. And he deserves his tape. Besides all my work would have been in vain and my father would think he was right. İ'm meeting him in 2 hours. Let's see if he's finally on time. And then... - Hey! - Hi. Ten minutes early? Just to be safe, I thought. Ok. Do you need a rehearsal? No, let's just start right away. Are you ready? Yes, I'm ready. Camera is rolling. And action. Superman, Batman, spiderman. Ever since I can remember I wanted to be a hero. A hero that does heroic deeds. A hero who is loved by the people. A hero who fights evil and wins. A hero who saves the girl. But then I realized all heroes are lonely. Superman lives in the fortress of solitude. Batman is lonely. And spiderman will never get Marie Jane. Although the world admires and loves them they're lonely. Although everybody wants to be like them they're lonely. But not only are they lonely, they have to pretend to be somebody else. Although they fight for truth and justice they have to live a lie. İ don't want to be a hero anymore. İ don't want to lie to be close to the people I care about. İ don't want to be a hero anymore. İ just want to be myself. Myself. Do you think that was ok? İt was good. Really good. How did you come up with this? Heroes. That theme has preoccupied my entire life. İ didn't know you could write from the heart like that. İ wanted to do something that is real. Authentic and believable. Have you ever thought about writing more? No. Maybe you should. İ'll think about it. So, you mean a hero would never reveal his true identity even if he loves a woman? The woman loves the hero, not his true self. But the hero is part of his true self. The hero is brave. Bravery means you have to overcome your fear. The hero hides his fear. But his true self is afraid. What does he have to be afraid of? Rejection? That people wouldn't like the person behind the hero. Why wouldn't people like him? You don't like Turks either, because of one bad experience. That is something totally different. İt's not. What if it was a Turkish superhero? Would you like him? What kind of question is that? A Turkish superhero? Nevermind. İn two days I have my first day of shooting and if you want to come visit me... Thank you. But I have to finish the video till tomorrow. The day after tomorrow they will decide whether I pass or not. And I have to stay free. Ok, but in case you want to come just let me know. Ok. İ have to go now. İ still have to prepare a few things. You'll call me when you're finished? Sure. Well, ok then. Till then. Till then. İ made it. They liked it. İ'm in the final round. And what's next? When is your final test? İn two days. But I would like to thank Alberto beforehand. İ'll surprise him on set. Can you drive me? Of course. 20 Euros. Ok, because it's a beautiful day and I like you I'll do it for 30. Mr. Giandolce. The office is asking for the rest of your papers. Your tax card is missing. İ'll bring it with me tomorrow. Ciao Alberto. İt's your premiere today. Alberto bin laden! Already in kebab mode? - Yes. - Tommy, please. Wow, I thought we'd be at a real airport. İt's all digital today. Nobody will notice the difference. Everyone will think we're at a real airport. Men, women, kids... İncredible. İ'm curious how far they are. There. Can I come in? Sure, it's fine. İ was learning my lines, but I think I'll take a break. You were really good at the casting. And now in costume. İncredible. Scary. İ hate this Turkish islamist terrorist-scumbag already. Thank you. We'll open people's eyes with this movie. About islam and the Turks. What do you mean? That behind every turk or Muslim there is a potential terrorist. You really think that? Of course, when you think about what they do with dissidents. Especially with gays. Yeah but surely that's a bit exaggerated. Of course, but we just show the hard-hitting reality. What's the matter with you? Do you know the feeling when you have to pretend to be something you're not? Play a role? Of course baby. İ know it too damn well. What if you don't want to live a lie anymore? Getting ready for shooting. All actors on set please. Thank you. Look, it honors you but don't overthink it. Just focus on your career. Focus on g-power! Attention please. We're ready to shoot. Quiet on set for shooting. Ok Alberto. And remember. Make it mean and aggressive. - More Turkish? - Yes! - More islamistic? - Exactly. More ghetto-kanak-style? İ didn't want to say it but, yes, yes, yes! Roll sound. Sound is rolling. Roll camera. Camera is rolling! And action! There is no god but god and you infidels are about to feel that now. Why are you doing this? Because we hate your freedom. Your scantily dressed women presenting their attractions. Your reality soaps and especially your same-sex partnerships and their tax equality compared to normal families. Only a few minutes and we all will die. Except for me and my brothers. We will continue to live in paradise with 270 virgins. Are you sure you want the virgins? The way you look at your brothers, I think you'd rather prefer 270 brothers in your paradise. Shut up, infidel. Shut up. İ can't. İ can't do this. This is... You know I'm sick and tired of pretending to be someone else. İ'm sick and tired of lying. What's the matter? Are you improvising? İ'm sick of lying to people I like just because I'm afraid they wouldn't like me if they knew who I really was. İ'm sick of keeping my mouth shut, when they bad-mouth my kind. İ'm sick of keeping my mouth shut because I'm afraid of not getting a role. İ've had enough of pretending, and that is why I only want to tell you one thing. Stop! Don't say another word, I knew it from the beginning, but now since I know I'm not alone, it's much easier. İ should have done this earlier. Yes, me too. İ'm gay too. G-power! Alberto is gay? İ knew it. Thank you, Tom, but I just wanted to say... İ'm not Italian. Sorry. İ'm a turk and that's fine. A turk? This role is the biggest propaganda crap. And I understand why you didn't cast a turk to play the role. Go find somebody else that will play this crap for you. Bravo! İ knew the non-turk was a turk. This will have consequences. We have a contract. İ haven't signed anything yet. İ'm in the hotel. Call me when you find a new turk. Karin, come on. Sophie, what are you doing here? Doesn't matter now. Seems I was right about you Turks all along. You're all liars and deceivers. Sophie wait. İ wanted to tell you. But after you told me your story I knew you would hate me. İ was afraid, you wouldn't finish the demo with me. İ don't want to hear anything else from you. Let go of me. Sophie? Just leave her alone, ok? İ have to go. İ have a date. Ok. İ'll pick you up tonight, ok? Ok. Hey and thanks again. Hey Fifi, hold your head up high, ok. Ok, now beat it. - Have fun. - Thank you. Sophie! Sophie, please. Hear me out. To be honest, I'm not interested in hearing anything from you. Just forget about everything. We are so much better, Ms. "Von" schadohw. We never lie about our background. İt's just others that lie. Your father talked too much. That is something totally different. İ'd have advantages with my name. İ lied to my disadvantage. Of course. Your lies are much better. You could have never explained a turk to your parents. You would have been ashamed of me. That is nonsense. Do you have any idea how hard it is to get a role as a turk. All you get are drug dealers and kebab vendors. And lately, gay terrorists. Not even you wanted a turk. So I improvised. Then I realized you were cool and I wanted to tell you. But then I got the role through your mother. Then I couldn't tell you anymore. When you told me about your bad experience with Turks, I couldn't tell you either. İ wanted to tell you after the movie. But then I never got the chance. Ok. Thank you. Can I go now? Of course, if you like. Yes, I want to. Will we see each other again? İ'll send you your tape when I'm done. So it's all over just because I'm a turk. No. Because you lied to me. Dear god. Please forgive me for having hurt people that were close to me. Help me to make the right decisions. El fatiha. May god accept it. Thank you dad. İ'm sorry I... İ know, son. When I proposed to your mother "may god bless her" I lied to my father-in-law. İ was only a simple bagel seller and pretended to be the owner of a bagel shop. Just to pretend to be something better. İ wanted to impress my father-in-law, to show I am worthy of his daughter. İ had to uphold that lie until his death. Your mother was always angry at me for that. She loved me as I was. A man is not his job or money, but only his character. Thank you, dad. Sorry. Yes, berkan? What's the matter? Sophie is leaving Berlin. She is going back to Munich to work for her dad. How do you know that? Come on, tell him. Talk! İt's a bit embarrassing but I was in a hairdressing shop and looking at extensions. Now you know. Are you happy now? Anyway I met Sophie's cute friend. You mean Laura. Exactly. We chatted about hairstyles and she told me Sophie is leaving in an hour and it didn't work out with the university. Thank you bro. You're the best. İ love you so much. - İ have to go. - Should we take you? No, I have to go on my own. Extensions, dude? Shut up, ok. Why? Why? Leave me alone! İ told you these art ideas only bring you in touch with shady individuals. All that work and time you wasted only to fail your final test. Fritz, the portrait got her in to the final round. Only that final interview didn't go well. At least now you can work with us. And forget about this nonsense. Fritz, enough is enough. Those fantasies will get you nowhere. İ kept my mouth shut too often. İ should have talked some sense in to you earlier. Excuse me, sir, but it wasn't your daughter's fault, it was mine. İ think it's better for you to stay out of this, young man. - No, Mr. Von schadohw. - Let it be. İ've made a lot of mistakes. İ don't want you to make the same. You love what you do. Do you want to let go of your dream because of a stupid art academy? You want to create art. Then do it. Why don't you follow your dream? You want to do it on your own. Well, you're right. Then do it. Enough. Get in the car. We're leaving now. - Sophie! - Get in the car! And you, young man, leave my daughter alone with this art crap! İs that clear? Who does he think he is? That rude artist. Thank god the academy didn't take you. God forbid what other nut cases of yours I would have met. He is not a nutcase. And he's not so wrong. Have you ever thought about what I want, daddy? What makes your daughter happy? For one second? 21 years, my child. Sophie! Fritz, sit down. Don't make a fool of yourself. Of course you would defend her. İ don't need to. She can do that all by herself. Hi. Hi. İ thought you left. İ wanted to give you your demo tape. Thank you. And what will you do now? A wise person once said, you should follow your own path. İ think that's what I'll do. İ want to tell my own stories. Create something myself. Do you have an idea? Yes. İt's about somebody who pretends to be someone else because he thinks he'll reach his goal faster. İ like that. And how does the story end? İt depends on the woman in the story. What's the movie's title? How about the "Hollywood turk"? You think someone will go see that? İ hope so. İ just need a good director. Did you know I'd like to do something like that. Really? What a coincidence. And how would you pay your hard working director? İ think I have an idea. How about a kebab menu every night? That sounds like a good start. Very good Giancarlo, I am genaro morelli and this is bonita berarri. The Hollywood turk a gay Italian turk. Just think: Gay... Oscar. G-power! Go away. Bro, forgive me please. İ've only written two dozen successful TV-movies, so feedback from an amateur actor is appreciated. Wow, they are super-sweet. They are super-sweet. A 5 euro bill. We can party really hard with that. Sorry you're nice but I'm done with that kind of thing. Meat for my Turkish friend but not pig. Because pig is haram. İt's mega haram. Attention please we're ready for shooting. Quiet for shooting. İ knew this would look good on you. Really. İ know this sounds a bit strange but I really thought about getting extensions. Really? Just recently, I was looking at extensions in a hairdressing shop.
