Mr Frank! It's past ten. Open up! - I can't do Mr Frank's room - Why not? - He locked himself up. - Locked himself up? He can't do that. No secrets in this house. - He never locked himself up before. - There's nothing Frank's never done. Frank? Jesus! What a bitch. I thought you never felt pain. Never mind, Nelly. Some other time. Goddamn. Drop dead. Is it loaded? Is there anything in there? I knew it. You don't even have the guts to put real bullets in. You're an asshole. Your suicide is fake. You're fake. Bang bang. None of those bitches you meet in bars are for real. If they were real women, you'd run away from them. Drop dead, asshole. Jesus! Look out! Damnit. Jesus! Get out, hurry. - Get out. - Is it bad? I'll never talk myself out of this. - I'm bleeding. - What? Say that I've gone to the doctor. - I'll go with you. - No, you stay here. When the police come, I'll have to go to the station and... ...they'll find too much blood in my alcohol. So stay here. It smells of alcohol here. Where's the driver? - I'm in trouble. - Anything else? - I have to get sober. - Go ahead. Here. It's unbelievable. That guy's insane. I already knew that. What happened? Drunk behind the wheel. They won't take this. He'll be fired. - Has Frank been to see you? - No, why? He's had an accident. -Is it bad? He was drunk, had a collision and ran off. - Why did he run off? - Because he was drunk, of course. If they find out, they'll take away his driving license. Without a license, he can't make his fun trips anymore. - Don't worry. - I do worry. I have to hear from the police that he was running around with some girl. Yesterday he pretended he'd shot a bullet through his head. Next time, he might use real bullets. What's wrong with him? Don't worry. He must be hiding at Max' place. - Do you have a lot of work? - Yes, a bit of overtime. Will I see you soon? - I'll drop by tomorrow. - Nice. Bye. - I thought you were the police. - No, no. - I'm a private detective. - For Eva, I bet. Hey, Max, wake up. Joop is here. - How's Eva? - She's angry. Why didn't you get in touch after the accident? I was dead drunk. I couldn't go home and wait for the police. You could have given her a call. She heard about it from the police, didn't she? Yes, but that's what she hates. She called you. And you said: Dear Eva... don't worry. He must be at Max' place. Is that true or not? - Shouldn't we call the doctor? - I'm the doctor. After this breakfast, the coughing stops. You can't give him that. You'll kill him. He's dying anyway. The more, the better. - What day is it today? - Friday. Friday, good. As of today, I'm free again. - Take me home. - Not to the business? The business? Which business? Hey, old man. You're looking hip again today. - See you. - Bye, Max. I think he should be fired. - Two accidents in half a year. - It wasn't that serious. - It wasn't proven that it was his fault. - But this time he was drunk. He'll lose his license. How can you sell cars if you can't drive? That's a technical problem. If the customer lives in Amsterdam, he can take a cab. But he does half of his business somewhere in the country. If he has to do business outside of Amsterdam, we have to get him a driver. - Do you know what that's going to cost? - Come on, Bert. We've got plenty of cars. Frank van Eeden has been our best salesman for four years now. Have you got a replacement for him? Not right away, of course. - We'll have to... - Exactly. We'll have to make do with him. He needs some strong guidance. Will you call him or should I? Alright, I'll call. Unpack this for me, please. - I have to go again. - Mr Frank's home. I don't have time. - Eva van Eeden speaking. - Hello, Mrs. Van Eeden. - Could I speak to Frank? - May I ask who you are? - From the personnel department. - You'll tell him he's fired. On the contrary, I wanted to reassure him. We expect him at work again tomorrow. But he just wrecked one of your cars. He's had a lot of bad luck. He's had a lot of booze, Mister Personnel. Still, you could help him. - Me? - Yes, you're his wife. So what? I never liked the work. You can tell him yourself that he still has his job. And if he won't listen, find somebody else. Goodbye. Someone wants to cut off gas and power. Cut off gas and power? Why? You haven't paid your gas and electricity bill. It's 178 guilders, including the fine. If you pay now, I don't have to cut you off. I'll be right back. I gave you 200 guilders to pay for gas and electricity. Did you forget to pay? Didn't I ask you? - Cut us off. - I'll pay. - Out of the question. - You can pay me back. No, Nelly, we already spent our gas and electricity money. - You're totally drunk. - Who's drunk? If you make this shot, I'll give you a tenner. - Ok! - Ok, ok! Ok, show-off. Red first. Time to close. We're closing. - Bye. - Bye. Your lawyer friend had a bit too much. Cheers, Uncle Max. Here's to you. We're celebrating the fact that my friend here... is retiring from business life. Finished! Can we have another round in this corner? Come on people! Joop! - This one's from the boss. - Who's the boss here? You? I'm the boss and after this round, I'll kick you out. Cheers. We're going. Where's your car? I don't know where it is. - I'll drive. - I can wreck my own car. Can I be of service? We're going to buy flowers for Eva now. Joop, they're closed. I can see that. I'm not drunk. Hey, salesperson, come out of there! Hey, salesperson, flowers! Sorry, I'll go around the back. Flower man, flower man. Shut your dog face. Joop! Eva. I'll get you back. - How did you get him so drunk? - He already was drunk. I wasn't drunk. Are you crazy? Turn off the light. Turn off the light! Turn off the light, darling. If you cooperate, you can blow out the candles. First a kiss from Franky. Just what we need. Turn off the light. Asshole. Bastard. I love you. I'm screwing you. Screw me. I'll screw you to hell. And then I'll screw you again. That feels so good. I'll screw you until you can't walk anymore. Screw me now. Wake up. Wake up, Joop. Wake up. Headache. Nice. I think I'll move in here. Did you think Frank gets breakfast like this every morning? - No? - No. Only when he's behaved really well. He mustn't have had breakfast in months then. We're going away for a few days. Right now? I'll run some errands and I'll be back at 1. Hey, Frank. I'll be back at 1. Make sure you'll be ready. - Hello. - Is Frank in? - He's asleep. - Wake him up then. Wait, I'm coming down. - Did you wake him up? - No, he had a late night. - His wife will be home too. - So? She must have heard about me. - Listen... - Sylvia. If I give you 50 guilders, will you leave? - 100? - Ok. Wait, I'll be right back. Hey, Frank! - Frank, open up. - Joop. Frank, open up. Where is that... - Who? - Who do you think? The more, the better. Where are my 100 guilders? He wanted to bribe me. I'd have given her this if she had left. Great for Eva. Sorry, I can't go with you. I have plans with Eva. She and I are going away for a few days. I'll leave, but can I eat my apple first? - Does that hurt? - Yes. And when I press here? No. How late are you? Almost three weeks. It could be. You can do a pregnancy test tomorrow morning. There's no need. I'm sure that I'm pregnant. Are you sure? Does Frank know? He doesn't even know I stopped taking the pill. He won't be very happy then. That's his business. Sylvia's gone. Where did you find her? Answer. Answer! If it's the police or my work, I'm not in. Hello? - Is that Frank? - Yes. Frank, is that you? Yes. Bert speaking. Hello, Bert. How are you? - How are you? - Pretty shitty. Didn't your wife tell you I called? Did you call? Of course, I called. We're expecting you at work on Monday. Monday, yes... that's ok. You're alright, aren't you? - I'm doing fine, boss. - Bert. Bert. Who am I talking to? Sorry, Bert. It was a joke. Frank speaking. I understand. Make fun of someone else. Finally I want to talk to the ass and he hangs up. They're expecting you at work on Monday. No way. I've sold enough cars. - The stupidest thing there is. - Doesn't it pay well? Does that mean I have to do it all my life? If I don't quit now, I never will. I'll find something else. So what if it pays less. Eva has the business. We have no children. I don't need to make that much. Besides, when I'm broke, I go to you. - Binoculars. - What a woman. What an ass. Show me. What is there to see? Have you never seen nudity? - I have to give it special spin. - You can't do it. It's past quarter past 1. What's keeping her? She'll be here soon. I'll go for a walk. Don't be too long. Just a bit of fresh air. The secret to happiness is freedom. And the secret to freedom is courage. Listen, I'm 62 now. I've seen everything, been everywhere, from Brazil to Indonesia. But this nonsense about freedom and happiness... you won't hear it from me. What do you think made King Solomon wise? Not from grabbing all those women. - Who's talking about grabbing women? - You. When you say freedom, I hear grabbing women. To fuck. I've been married to my wife for 30 years. During the last 28 years of those, I didn't go to bed with her once. Max, you're making it up. You don't make that up. She was a Catholic. A very religious woman. Very beautiful. When we had our child... I stopped going to church. I didn't want to anymore. I was young. I was much younger than you are now. First she sent the priest after me. But he couldn't make me go to church. So I couldn't get into her bed anymore. You're lying. - Then she was crazy. - I was crazy. Would it have hurt me to go to church now and then? It's better than getting drunk or going to the whores. She was a great woman. Max, I don't understand anything anymore. I loved her. She's the only woman I really loved. Hey Max, have you seen my new squeeze? Her name's Gertie. Say hello to Max. She likes fat but that isn't my fault. - What's that, Hans? - A double, Max. Make it a big double then. There you go. Cheers, max. It's time you found out about the big double. What is that secret, Max? Bigger glasses. Maria, leave that boy alone. He has enough problems. I'm not doing anything. Nothing's enough for him. Let him go. I want to play against him. Do you want to lose to me? As punishment, I'll beat you. I'll win all your money. I'll get you drunk and carry you home. I must be crazy. This is insane. I have a bar myself. I don't need to go to all those other bars. But each Saturday evening, it happens again. I have to do a bar crawl. When I drink at home, I don't feel at ease. Do you understand that? I've lived in Bahia for 6 months. Salvador. Most beautiful city of Brazil. Beautiful black people. You wouldn't know. Saturday nights, we went to bars. They all knew me. I didn't have to pay anywhere. Everybody took me home. The women... They did everything for me. I had to show my chest everywhere. They loved it. My hair was... Salvador. Eva. I'm sorry. I'm drunk. Your humble servant deserves the worst... that you can think of. Why didn't you wait for me? I was only half an hour late. I was with Max. I don't care who or where. We had plans. I spend all my life waiting for you and you can't wait half an hour for me. We were going away for a few days, remember? You couldn't call me to tell me you changed your mind. You look like a baby. I am a baby. Baby's drunk. You'll end like Max. A sad, old drunk. And then what? Then Franky can't grab little girlfriends anymore. Poor Max. He has no one to look after him. You smell of jenever. Frank? I'm pregnant. What did you say? I'm pregnant. I don't like those kinds of jokes. It's not a joke. I stopped taking the pill three months ago. Leave me alone! I've always told you I don't want children. And then you pull this nasty stunt on me. To stop taking the pill. To set me up. I shouldn't have trusted you. I should have known. I should have known! You couldn't have picked a better moment. Now that I'm looking for another job. How could you do it? What do you want? Destroy me? I'm sorry for you. I don't want to be a father. And I won't be a father! - Get an abortion. - I won't get anything. You have no say over me anymore. - I don't have any say about this? - No. It's my child and I want it. If you don't want it, you can get lost. I don't need you. We don't need you. - Trouble again? - He kills everything I feel for him. And what do you do? Pack your suitcases and get out for a few days. And then you come back and it starts all over again. It's ridiculous. Why are you going? Make him go. He'll be back within a week. Nelly's coming tomorrow. Tell her that... just say nothing. I bet she's been arguing with Frank. What is it to you? Do you know how much the power bill was? 178 guilders. And where do I pay that? You don't need to. I already sent Martin. Did Eva give you the money? Of course, I won't pay it myself. Just what I need. - Someone for you? - Yes. Frank, how are you? I'm the shrink who has to get you back to work. I won't be back. - What do you mean? - I'm resigning. - We didn't know anything about that. - Now you do. Don't try to talk me out of it. I've made up my mind. Are you going to work for another company? - Are you crazy? - I don't understand. You've got to make money. What about the house? You're paying 1500 rent per month. You can't do that from your wife's little business. Get lost. You're jealous because you don't have a big house. Here, present from the company. Think about it. The more, the better. What do you think about this? We'll do that letter to Visser this afternoon. Please. Can I stay with you for a couple of days? Of course. As long as you want. What happened? I don't recognize myself anymore. Frank makes me so insecure. I feel like I'm not real. I don't know what to do. Everything is so half half between us. She's giving me a hard-on. It's unbelievable. - You'd think it was a nightclub. - Indeed. It's not helping me. I haven't had an erection for months. I don't have that problem. You will. Sex doesn't last long. It's a temporary pleasure. Don't forget it'll end soon. - I don't think it'll ever stop for me. - It will. What are you thinking? Of Frank. Frank? Why? I'm not even thinking of Frank. Darling, you've talked about him all night. Have I? I've been talking about myself. Yes, about you and Frank. But I'm not thinking of him anymore. I want to go to bed with you. Not now, Eva. Why not? - Because I'm pregnant? - Come on. You know what I mean. Don't you feel like it? Jesus, I'm about to burst. I'm shaking. Where? Eva... - Don't be a prude. - I am a prude. That's what attracts you. That I'm the opposite of Frank. That I don't sleep with everyone, like Frank. Nonsense. Listen. I love you. I long for you. But tomorrow you'll go back to Frank. And I'll be a mess. I remember the first time. It's exactly the same. I don't want it. I can't do it. Do you understand? - Frank? - Don't let him in. - Tell him I'm not here. - He must have seen your car. Why is he here? I don't want to see him. Who says he's here for you? Come up. The more, the better. - Is she angry? - Ask her. Are you angry? She doesn't answer. Who'll be the happy father of the child? You or me? How funny. How very funny. Are you here too? What are you doing here? - I came to apologize. - That's too late. Much too late. Get lost. This is my morning affliction. I'm not complaining. What do you see? A hot woman making a bed. Is that all? I'm waiting until she undresses. No comment? I'm not complaining about your morning affliction. And you don't complain about mine. Is that a proposition for a deal? Of course. Why not? Living apart together. That's all we've ever done. I want you to accept me the way I am. I thought I was trying. But if you ever end up with that hot woman across the road... I won't be waiting for you here, with these binoculars. Yes, you will. Don't you believe me? Go then. - I have a complaint. - Do we know each other? No, but I know you. The way you walk around naked, upsets me. I'll show you where I live. Do you see that window and that woman? - Yes. - From there I can look straight in. But you can't see me from that distance. I can with binoculars. What do you want? I can't keep the curtains closed all day. That's true. But if you could close them now... for 15 minutes. I made a bet with someone who doesn't believe... that you and I... Back already? I thought you'd be gone much longer. You were worried, weren't you? - No. - Liar. I saw you look. You were pissing your pants. Admit it. The more, the better. I knew it. Frank! You have company. Frank! I have to show you something. Here, look. Isn't she a hot, blonde chick? She's got longer legs than you. Show it. He's got a nice willy. Do you know what he calls it? Can I tell her? Silly Henkie. Silly Henkie has to have a bath first. Then we'll go out with the four of us. The three of us and silly Henkie. Ok? Are you having another argument with your woman? - Who says that? - I do. I'm old but not senile. You've been completely unbalanced lately. I won't say anything because I've cheated half my life. But the stunts you pull... Be careful. You're talking like a vicar, old man. You're doing the same stupid things that I did 30 years ago. You're a selfish, immature, pigheaded idiot. When the music has stopped, you're still dancing. I think you're really sick. You have a high fever. Time to go to sleep. Stubborn idiot. Don't get worked up. You might start coughing again. Stubborn idiot! Eva, let me in. Open up, Eva. What's wrong? Listen. That's a cat. We don't have a cat. It's coming from there. From that cupboard? How's that possible? - It's coming from outside. - It's coming from the cupboard. How can there be a cat in that cupboard... if you don't even have a cat? Where did he go? Not so fast. It was a joke. Right, laugh. How did you get in? I always get in everywhere. Who was that man? Why do you care? I want to know. If you had kept quiet, you would have known a lot more now. It made me incredibly horny. I couldn't watch any longer. Jealous? Very jealous. Shall we make love? Why not? I long for you. I don't feel like it. - But with him you did feel like it. - Yes. With him I did feel like it. - So I'm not good enough anymore. - Exactly. You're not good enough for me. - You don't mean sexually? - Yes, sexually too. You think you can solve everything with sex. For you, there's only one thing: sex, sex, sex. If you're so good in bed, why am I so unhappy? - What have you got against sex suddenly? - I have nothing against sex. You don't seem to understand there's also other contact than just screwing. What kind of other contact did you have with that man? I would have been enough for him. I'm not enough for you. - What kind of nonsense is that? - It's not nonsense. If I'm enough for you, why do you need all those other women? No. I won't go to bed with you. Then I'll go. - And I won't come back! - Asshole! Go then! Jerk! Well, go then. I don't need you, jerk. Go then. You have enough places to sleep. You asked for it. Pregnant bitch! Asshole, never come back! Jerk, you forgot your suitcase. - What do you want? - I'll tell you when I'm inside. Eva isn't here. I'm not here for Eva. What do you want then? Serve yourself. Don't you have any jenever? - Why are you laughing? - For no reason. What do you want? Why are you here? I want to sleep with you. That's Frank for you. Anything else? - Come a bit closer. - I'm fine here. "I want to sleep with you." Is that how it always goes? - Sometimes. - And that works? - Sometimes. - I have to disappoint you. It doesn't work with me. - Oh, no? - No. No matter how much you want it. I don't want to sleep with you. - You wouldn't think so. - Did you think you aroused me? No, you can't arouse me. Your time's up. I'll see you out. Let go of me. Stop it. Stop it! Come here. Let him... Come here. Let it go. Go to sleep, darling. I'll be right there. But I'll be back. - He keeps asking for you. - Where were you? - We couldn't reach you. - What's wrong with him? He's coughing up blood. - Did you call a doctor? - He doesn't want a doctor. We can't go to the back anymore either. Max. What's wrong with you? Nothing. A bit of a cold. I've been waiting for you. I feel bad. Sylvia? You have to do something for me. Anything you want. There's a brown envelope in that cupboard. At the bottom. This one? Open it. 6,000 guilders. I'll tell you what to do with it. No flowers. They always made me sneeze. No priest either. They always make me puke. No Beethoven. Bossa nova. No burial. Cremation. Leaves less of a mess. Max, if you need me, I'll be next door. Yes. It's Max' party, yes? So Max should be here. Hello, Maxie. Hello, boy. I'm going to miss you. Silence! I've been asked to... ...speak to Max for the last time. Let him finish. Max... Why don't you organize my life, Joop? You do everything so well and so calmly. - So sensibly. - That's only how it looks. Yes, of course. Good to see you. I wasn't sure if it was you. Not so fast. Why did you have to do it so fast? Why so fast? We have all night. Sorry, I'm... - Why are you laughing? - I'm laughing at myself. Are you going? So that was the big womanizer, Frank van Eeden. I haven't fucked many men in my life, but you broke the speed record. Fifteen minutes ago, we were still sitting in the living room. And now you're going. Speedy Frank. That's what they should call you. Speedy Frank. I should have known. - Can you lend me 100 guilders? - No. I'll pay you back. - I don't have it. - Ok. Goodbye. Bye. Bye, speedy Frank. And thanks. Mr Frank! He's locked his door again. You don't need to do his room anymore. Frank? I'm leaving you. I mean it. Jesus, I could have killed you. Idiot, I'm leaving you! You're crazy!
