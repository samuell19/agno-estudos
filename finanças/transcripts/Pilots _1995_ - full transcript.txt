I've to go to southern Denmark For six days On the 23rd Hamm is the most northerly destination on my route Merde Won't be near there Leverkusen Hotel Paris, on the 25th Michel, I've to go Some day we'll have our own place, Karin, some day Pilots Hurry up already Anything the matter? Sinatra is dead Nonsense Doesn't mention a live show here You know what this means. They changed the broadcast, because he's dead. Audrey Hepburn is dead, too. Whenever they're showing something beautiful someone is dead. Cancer. They aired Sabrina. As a memorial you could display our bath salt My Way in the shop window That's what killed him You work in teams now? Good morning. Karin Kramer, Blue Eyes. I'd like to talk to you about cosmetics in Germany. I don't believe this. Crap. Sinatra deserves many praises, but above all His musical and lyrical material is always first-class. 1966. Strangers in the night. Looks appealing, right? Not a hint of violence A beautiful woman like yourself would never enter a cigar-and-arms shop Too louche, delinquent But this This you could sell in any chemist store, right? And just as effective! Don't be afraid, it needs a battery. Yesterday I was still poolside with him. Real beach, too. And cocktails served in fruit Huge rooms And today I fix my eye-liner in the rear view mirror Who among your colleagues wouldn't want that? Once Blue Eyes is finished I will definitely live with him. What's going to happen to Blue Eyes? We're leaving for Bali What's up with Blue Eyes? You can live for 20 Mark a day there in complete luxury Once entrepeneurial daring is no longer rewarded in Germany He is going to leave, and he's taking me with him. All this work There's no reward for it The girls also cost 20 Mark on Bali If that much And they're younger My ass is still tighter than any of the young ones around here So what's going on in the firm? And how much do we cost? 30 Mark, tops. Zone 4 as agreed Has been a bit flat lately, you got to get closer to the customers Junior wants to see performance Who's he? Performance What's going on around here?

Your older colleague, what's her name? Which older one? The one in the elevator this morning Karin? Is she still any good? Not like before What's the matter with her? Older more exhausted I was asked to show you into his office 4,000 units? That's a peak value And we're out of season I need no market assessment, I want sales. And by the way, Blue Eyes covers employee work expenses so that they don't have to sleep in their vehicles So that customers are spared the appearance of unkempt sales personnel and their unkempt company vehicles That is my own car and that was my vacation And on vacation one sleeps where and with whom one pleases 4,000 units And an assistant Where are we headed? Look it up if you like Look it up where? This your first time? This? What am I doing? You know best what that might be Excuse me, I'm a non-smoker And what else are you?

I don't care about the others Yes Yes Obviously I'm only doing this for you I'd rather sleep alone, too But 36 Mark five times this week... I simply can't afford that And Junior doesn't want to spring for it either? 36 Mark What? He can't spare 36 Mark for his little girl? That's nothing to him So out with it, why are you here? Leave me alone. That one over there wants my job She's young and dangerous She's the junior boss' girlfriend Supposed to check up on me. If I can't meet the figures I'm out Sometimes I'd like to go back on the road But it's always getting harder out there How many units? 4,000 This month? Per week.
