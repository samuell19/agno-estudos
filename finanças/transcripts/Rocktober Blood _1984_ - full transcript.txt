Mary, she's-- - I told you she was hanging around. - Geez. - Why aren't you seeing Rainbow Eyes? I wrote that song for you. Now, I want to hear you sing it. - You're crazy, Billy! Mary's hanging up there dead, and you want me to sing? Somebody's killed her! [Billy laughs] - I know. [laughs] It was me. [laughs] - You? Oh my God. [suspenseful music] Stay away from me, Billy. [Billy laughs] You're sick. - You're not going anywhere. [Lynn squeals] [Lynn screams] [Lynn gasps] [suspenseful music] - You think I'm sick, huh? I'm gonna show you what rock and roll horror's all about. [Lynn screams] Sing! - I wear my skirts short, I love some weed. - Shut up! I hate the way you sing my songs. I know what you need, you need a little help. [Lynn whimpers] There's no fear in your voice. Sing! - I wear my skirts short. I love some weed more. I want to. - Shut up! You make me sick.

[Lynn screams] - [Billy] I'm gonna kill your ass. [laughs] [hard rock music] - Listen, my friend. Let's get in, get out as quick as we possibly can. I don't fuck around with this shit. I wanna get drunk, I wanna get laid. In that order, you got it? - Get it. - You with me? - Yeah. - You with me, man. - All the way. - All right, okay. Let's set up by this coffin, kids love all this death crap. Hold the mic. - Sure. [hard rock music] - A little cokesky, get us going? - Uh, no thanks, man. - You sure? - Go ahead, no. - All right. [nose snorting] - You all right? - Ah, yeah. [nose snorting] How about it, am I clean? - No, man, no, you're not clean, no. - [snorts] Is that better? - That looks good, we're doin' it. - [snorts] All right, let's get this in here, Mel. All right, give me a countdown, would you, Mel? Okay. - [Mel] Five, four, three, two, one. - Hi, I'm Rick Righteous, and you're watching MVTV, and this is another exclusive report. Now, the festivities that you see going on all around me here are part of the Rocktober Blood '84 Tour. And I gotta tell ya, it's an incredible party. Now, as most of you remember, it was a year ago that rock idol, Billy Eye, was executed for the mass murder of 25 rock and rollers and his close friend and engineer, Kevin Eddy, not to mention the near fatal stabbing of Lynn Starling. But that was a year ago, and the band's back together in a new form now. They're called Headmistress, and they're fronted by none other than Lynn Starling. And I think, if I'm not mistaken, I see her coming through the crowd here. Lynn, Lynn, can I have you over here for a second? How are you doing, Lynn? - Fine, how are you? - I'm doing just great. Thanks for talking to the MVTV cameras. Now, Lynn, can you give us a little brief description of what the show is all about? - Sure, Rick. Well, it's wild, the special effects are out of sight. Smoke and blood and guts. Well, you saw some the other day. - I sure did, and I'm gonna send you my dry cleaning bill, as well. No, but seriously, I just want you to know, speaking for myself and all of your fans, how glad we all are that you've decided to come out of hiding and get back on the stage where you belong. - I just wasn't ready before. - Well, whatever, you look great, Lynn. Now, everybody knows that you're the one who fingered Billy Eye. If it wasn't for you, he probably would have never been executed. How does it feel performing his show with his band, this rock and roll spectacular of death? - Well, first it was extremely difficult, but as I got more and more into the songs and the music, Billy was a really gifted musician. He just went berserk. - Now, tell me this, I understand that right up until the very end, he claimed he was innocent. - I know, it was the hardest thing I've ever done. Identifying him. We lived together for a while. But believe me, it was him. He just went crazy. Now, if you'll excuse me. - Okay, thank you very much. Lynn Starling, one of the true gutsy performers in the world of rock and roll. This has been Rick Righteous for MVTV, another special report. Hey Chris, how you doing? - Good, how you doin', man? - Good. - Come on down. We're having a party. - Oh, thanks a lot, hey, man. You want a little toot or something to get you going? - Yeah, let's go-- - Oh man, you're still rolling? Shit, turn that thing off! What's wrong with you, man?

God, you're as white as a sheet. What are you doing up here? - Oh, Chris! It's Billy. - Who? - Billy Eye. - Billy Eye's dead, you must be imagining things. - I'm not, he was here, Chris. - It must've been someone playing a joke. - It was him, he was dressed like Death. - Death, you mean Frankie? - Yes, it was Billy. - Hey, come on, stop it. You know damn well he god zapped. People don't come back from the dead. [hard rock music] [crowd cheering] [people chattering] [fist smashing] [Frankie groaning] [people chattering] Hey, asshole, one more joke like that, and you'll start collecting unemployment, all right? - It wasn't a joke.

He can take Honey, Lynn and Donna up to the lake tonight. - But, Chris, I have a lot of work to do on the show. - Any work you gotta do, you can do with Donna at the lake. - But I have a-- - Look, all I want you to do is be happy, relaxed, and away from all the practical jokes, okay? - Okay.

[intense rock music] [feet thudding] You okay? - Yeah, fine. - You sound sulky. I thought we came up here to relax. - We did. - Look, I've been knowing you for two years without learning something about you. What is it, the concert? Chris? What is it? - I saw something. - In the woods? - Yeah. It was Billy. [intense rock music] [feet thudding] - Oh, come on, don't start that shit again. [button clicking] - Look, I nearly broke my fucking neck trying to get away from him. I hurt my hand, I broke my nail. [teeth crunching] Look, I know you think I'm crazy again, but I saw what I saw. - Did you speak to him? - No. - Did you touch him? - No. - Lynn, you couldn't have seen him. The man is dead. - Look, I don't care whether you believe me or not. I don't want to talk about it anymore. - If you don't get ahold of yourself, they're gonna send ya back to that shrink. - Look, you'd better shut up, or I'm gonna fire you right here, now, on the spot! - Whatever you say. - Look, I'm sorry, Donna. I'm just on edge right now, I'm sorry. - Forget it. Come on and work out with me, it'll help you relax. - Okay. - Well, I'm not gonna exercise anymore.

If you're still scared, call the sheriff. - Well, thanks a lot. - Damn it, Lynn, I'm trying to get a show together. What do you expect me to do? Just because you're imagining-- - I'm not imagining anything, I'm not crazy. He's after me. - I never said you were. Look, I don't wanna argue. - Well, I don't want to argue either.

[whimpers] [Lynn screams] - [Chris] Ah, ah, ow! [knife squelching] - [Lynn] Chris! - The call sounded really urgent, man. - You're bloody right, it's urgent. I want all the security in this place doubled. Someone's trying to scare the hell out of Lynn. I don't even want a fly getting in here. - Don't worry about a thing, I'll take care of it. It's under control. What's happened anyway? - Just like I told ya, she tried to kill me. I came home. She's waiting in the dark with a butcher's knife. Got me right in the fucking arm, man. She thought I was Billy Eye. - Harper? [laughs] He's been dead for two years. - Yeah, I know that. God damn, she keeps, she insists that he's still alive. - Like it in there? This thing wasn't working right in Detroit. I almost got stuck in there. - Well, it's working fine now. Maybe someone tried to lock you in. - Very funny, all I need is another practical joker around here. Fix it! - [whispers] Bitch. - So, I guess he told ya, I almost killed him. I thought he was Billy Eye. - Sure, he told me. Dead people chasing you around, and you've been under a lot pressure, okay? - Listen, he chased me all over my own house. He chased me through the woods. - Well, somebody chased you through the woods, okay, but I don't think it was Billy Eye. He's dead, okay, Jesus. - Well, if it wasn't Billy then who was it? - I don't know who it was. - You don't know who it was because it was him. He's after me. Donna's missing too. - [Security] Donna's missing now, sure. - Now, look, Donna is in San Francisco, shacked up with some drummer. You know Donna like I know Donna. New man, no Donna. - Lynn, who else has seen Billy besides you, huh? - No one, are you trying to tell me I'm nuts or something? - No, I don't think you're nuts. You sign the paychecks, okay? If you want me to see Billy Eye, that's who I'll see, Billy Eye, okay? [Chris laughs] - He's alive, and I won't believe he's dead till I see his body. I want it dug up. - You talk it over with Chris, I'm not getting involved. I'm security, okay? - [Man] Lynn, can I talk to you a minute? - Some security you are, you suck. - [sighs] What are we gonna do now, huh? - Well, we pamper her. This is all very real to her. You know how long she was in therapy. - Therapy, yeah. You know, I think she should go back into therapy, to tell you the truth. Are you gonna dig up a dead body? - What, are you crazy, you're gonna dig it up. - No way, I'm not digging him up. I'm not digging any dead body up, okay? I know he's dead. - Yeah, I know he's dead too. It's Lynn we got to convince. Somebody's trying to drive her crazy. - Well, have you two decided to have me committed yet? - Look, you went to the funeral, you saw the body. - He said I wouldn't escape again. - You don't have to worry, Lynn. We got the best security in the business. I won't let anything get in and get you, okay? I promise. - Yeah, right, tell me about it. Where were you every time this creep comes around anyway? - What am I gonna catch, The Invisible Man? I mean, geez, show me the guy and I'll catch him. But the only one who's seen him's you, okay? [laughs] - [Lynn] Chris, I want you to go with me. - There's no way I'm gonna go and dig up any dead bodies. Those places give me the creeps. - There's no dead body in that grave, I'm telling you. - This is insane, damn it. - Fine, then I'll go with or without you. - Damn, make a bloody fool of yourself, go ahead. Lynn. Look, you know I'm not gonna let you go out there by yourself. Even if I have to chain you to the bed. Hey, that seems like a pretty good idea. - Very funny. You know, if you don't go with me, I'll just go by myself. - Okay, go ahead, dig the bastard up. - You really don't love me, do you? - Look, love has got nothing to do with it. I just don't want to go to jail. It's a criminal offense to dig up dead bodies. In case it hadn't occurred to you. - I'm telling you, the grave is empty. - You ever seen a dead person, Lynn? - He's not there. - I see, he's been in that grave about two years. he should be well decayed by now, well rotted. He'll have maggots crawling all over his eyes. Worms crawling all over him, and he'll smell lovely. You ever smelled a dead person? - You're not gonna scare me. I almost killed you, you know. He's fucking not there! He's been in my house, he was at the lake. He's not in that grave. - Your crazy, do you know that? It's still against the law. They'll take my fucking green card. - Your green card? - Yeah, the little card that gets me in and out of the country to make you money. - Money, is that all you think about? - [sighs] Come on, cut the shit. - I can see you very clearly now. I don't give a damn if they take your green card away. I'm gonna dig up the grave. If I get caught, I'll claim insanity. You can be the witness. - He's in that grave. - My ass, Billy Eye is not in that grave, and I'm gonna prove it to you. - But what if he is? - He's not! [crickets chirping] [car humming] [motor humming] Well. Come on. - Look. You're my best friend. I'd do nearly anything for you. - What are you so scared about? I'm telling you, there's nobody in that grave. It's just an empty box. He's gotten away somehow. - I'm not getting out of this car. - Suit yourself then, sit here with all these dead people. I'm going. [car door thuds] Sure does smell funny out here. [grass crunching] [crickets chirping] [hands sliding] [suspenseful music] [wolf howling] [suspenseful music] [grass crunching] [suspenseful music] [grass crunching] [wolf howling] [suspenseful music] [grass crunching] - Lynn! [suspenseful music] [car door thuds] Lynn. Lynn! Lynn! Uh. Excuse me. Lynn! [grass crunching] [suspenseful music] [shovel scratching] Lynn! Lynn! - Will you shut up before you wake the dead? - [Lynn] That's very funny. What'd you find? - I found the grave, what do you think? I was at the funeral, remember? [suspenseful music] [wolves howling] [shovel scratching] [distant crying] - I think I hear something. - Shh! - I can't believe you talked me into this. [suspenseful music] [shovel scratching] - I think I hear it too. [dramatic music] - You need some help? I'm sorry. - Oh God. - God, I just can't believe you're doing this. This is crazy. Well, let's open the sucker up. Let's get this over and done with. Get the hell out of here. [shovel scratching] [shoes thudding] [shovel scratching] - This isn't gonna work, you know? [coffin lid clanging] [suspenseful music] [coffin lid creaking] - I'm back. [Lynn screams] [Lynn screams] - He's alive, he's alive! - Lynn, Lynn, Lynn, quit it! Lynn, pull yourself together, he's dead, come on. - He's alive! - Lynn, the man is dead. Would you look? Look! Look at it, that is dead, look! [suspenseful music] Now that is as dead as you get, right? [cars humming] - I made such a fool of myself, Chris. I was so sure it was him. - Come on, everybody knows that Billy's dead. Just that old black magic's got you in it's spell. All you gotta do is just think about it. It's all behind you, snap out of it, it's time to wash off. This is your night, you're gonna blow 'em away. [suspenseful music] - All right, if any of you overpaid, underworked people want a paycheck this week, let's get the lead out. Come on, last check before the show, come on, let's go. Give me some heads - [Man] We need some blues down there. - [Security] All right, turn those lights down. [people chattering] [suspenseful music] [tools banging] - Just relax. All I want you to do is to concentrate on the show. I'll take care of you. - Okay, you better. [lips smacking] - Hey, give me some of that. - Okay. - Loosening up on the way to the show. [Lynn laughs] Get me off the show. It's gonna be great. - I hope so. I hope you're right. - Okey dokey! [Lynn laughs] [distant banging] [Honey squeals] - Who are you? - Death. [Honey screams] [iron hisses] [drums banging discordantly] [suspenseful music] [people chattering] - Here it comes. [people chattering] All right, hey, Chris. Hey, how ya doin'? I got the casket working great. Security's tight, don't worry about a thing. The show's gonna be perfect. Hello. [laughs] [people chattering] [tools banging] [suspenseful music] [instrument ringing] [people chattering] [smoke hissing] [distant banging] [people chattering] [smoke hissing] [suspenseful music] [cars humming] [horn honking] [objects rattling] - [whispers] Shit. [buttons clicking] [phone ringing] - Yeah. - Chris, have you seen Honey? I need her to help me with my wig. - Hey, babe, how the hell do I know where she is? It's my job to care of business, not some dizzy blonde. You got 15 other people working for you down there. Get one of them to find her. - [sighs] Well, excuse me, forget it. [phone receiver rattles] [suspenseful music] [heels clacking] [dramatic music] [man mutters] [heels clacking] [dramatic music] [people chattering] [smoke hissing] Hey, Chris! [suspenseful music] [people chattering] - Watch out for all the construction up there. They're remodeling the whole place. It's all torn down. - All right. [heels clacking] [people chattering] [suspenseful music] [heels clacking] - [Billy] I've been waiting for you. - Chris. It's him. [Billy laughs] Chris. It's him. - [Billy] I'm going to get you know. [Lynn screams] [heels clacking] - I saw you, you're dead. - I am Billy, and I'm back. [laughs] And I'm gonna take you to hell with me. [laughs] [heels clacking] Gotcha! [Lynn screams] - Let go of me. [whimpers] - You're right, Lynn, I'm not dead, I'm alive. - I saw you in the grave! - Haven't you figured it out yet? They, no you, you killed the wrong man. - Oh my God. - You identified my dearly beloved brother, Billy Eye Harper. Well, not exactly beloved. - He tried to tell me, but I didn't believe him. You killed all those people, and let your own brother take the blame? - Sure, I did it. I planned it all. Fucker. They wanted him, they didn't want me. I'm John. I'm the musical genius, I wrote it all. He lied. He cheated. - Billy. - I'm not Billy, I'm John. I won't hurt you. - Billy! [stick whacking] - Bitch! [footsteps pattering] [Lynn whimpering] [footsteps pattering] [footsteps pattering] [water dripping] [door clatters] [water dripping] Come out, come out wherever you are. I'm gonna find you. [water dripping] [bottle rattling] [water dripping] [bottle rattling] [water dripping] [footsteps pattering] I know you're here somewhere. [water dripping] [water dripping] [Lynn screams] - Billy. - I'm not Billy, but sometimes he tells me what to do. Sometimes he forgets. He forgot about you and my songs. He stole my music. Why did he do that? I wrote it all for you. - Me? - You wanted to be a star, I made you one. But I've been watching you. Denver, Seattle, Detroit. You put on a lousy show. What are you trying to do to me? Why don't you sing my music right? - You're sick, Billy. Let me help you. - [laughs] You think I'm sick? It's a little late for help. You don't understand, Billy killed too many people. You don't know about Donna and Honey. [laughs] - Please don't kill me. - You're gonna die. But first, we're gonna put on a show. It's gonna be the ultimate Rocktober blood and gore show. The one that I wrote. [Lynn screams] Hang on, Rainbow Eyes. I'm gonna make you real pretty tonight for the grand finale. [people chattering] We're gonna do it good tonight. All your shitty performances everywhere. I wasn't there. I did everything for you. Why couldn't you love me? Why couldn't you have been mine? [John chuckles] I'll show you all tonight. I'll show everyone. Why didn't you love me? We'll put on a good show tonight, okay? [distant cheering] Be good now. It's show time.
