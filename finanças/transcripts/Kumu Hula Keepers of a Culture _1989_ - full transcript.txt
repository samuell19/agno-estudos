(chanting in foreign language) - I think the challenge of a person today is wanting to learn how to chant or may be beginning to want to approach the door to open and enter into the room in which one can learn how to chant. And then in order to get to that point, we need to try to look for that voice, look for that chanting voice. To find it in each one, because, you know, that chanting voice is in each of us, even though, probably, when hum to ourselves or if you're just singing at the top of our heads, and into a song that we hear on the radio. It's gonna be a more Western kind of voice because that's what surrounds us today. It's that Western kind of singing. So, the Hawaiian sound is something that we should all strive for. And then it's something that we should believe that we can attain. (chanting in foreign language) (speaks in foreign language) (chanting in foreign language) - You have your different size of hula drums that are used for dancing. You have your great, big tempo drums, and then the small bangos. The size of it makes the difference of its tone. And you have a little small one like this. (drum) It has a different sound, and then you have a real small, little head like this. You have a higher sound. (drum) All right? And then if you have a great, big one like this, then you have one of those. (drum) (drummer sings in foreign language) - And your last motion is here, right, when you're down, okay? So that you stay in that position, and then you're just showing the fire you're devising, okay? So, you move your hands, and you use to go one, two, three, okay, that's two, one, two, down, one... All like this. Yeah. Scooping up, raising and up, fire. Okay, try it. Ready? Go, down! One, two, three, four. Beautiful, beautiful. (drummer chants in foreign language) - If any of you plan to become instructors in the art form, you have to remember this masculine style and the more feminine, soft and gentle style of hula, okay? So, in this dance, I want that strength. I want that. - [Voiceover] Yeah. - We call it, I don't know, I'm trying to reach, just like this wind blowing right now. Just strong this wind is blowing. That's what I want applied in the dance. Here we go, (speaks in foreign language) (drums) (chanting in foreign language) (speaks in foreign language) - And welcome to Lanikuhonua. We're gonna begin the show. First, we proudly present, an award-winning halau, headed by its kumu hula, John Kaha'i Topolinski, and the beautiful ladies and the handsome men of Ka Pa Hula Hawaii. (chanting in foreign language) (drums) (man speaks in foreign language) (drums) (chanting in foreign language) (dancers speak in foreign language) - [Voiceover] We'd like to bring our keikis back at this time, and they'd like to share with you a tune entitled I Ali'i No 'Oe. (guitars) (group sings in foreign language) (speaks a foreign language) - Her questions was (speaks in foreign language) which translates as - [Voiceover] Where is your hula halau? - Where is your hula halau? My hula halau is on the Big Island, the island of Hawaii, in Hilo, and we were born and raised in Hilo, and we were brought up in the hula kahiko tradition, which means that my grandmother was originally our teacher, and she taught us how to do the hula when we were little kids, four, five, six years old. The hula has been our tradition, my grandmother with her uncle before her, with my mother, and now with my sister and I. (drums) (chanting in foreign language) (speaks in foreign language) (speaks foreign language) - Was the question, which translates as? - [Voiceover] Who is your mother? - Who is your mother? My mother was Edith Kanahaole, and she died a few years ago, in fact. Nine years ago. But my mother was the one that actually taught us besides dancing, taught us how to chant, and taught us the many kaunas that the chants have. (drums) (chanting in foreign language) (drums) - Because we are a halau from the Big Island, because my grandmother was from the Big Island, and it goes back many generations from the Big Island. The eruption of Pele, and all of these different activities of the volcano, not only the eruption itself, but the steaming, the ups and downs of the lands because of volcanic activities. And also the growth as well, the kinds of vegetation that they get there. All has to do with Pele as far as we're concerned. So our dancers are what we call aiha'a, and aiha'a is, you stay close to the ground. The ground is where we get our energy from, so you don't see us leaving the ground at any time. Some of the other dancers may have dances that were choreographed, where you have actually both feet leaving the ground. In our halau, that's not our style because that's where we get all of our energy from, from the ground, and the ground again is representative of, represents, rather, Pele. Pele, herself, the ground is filial. (chanting in foreign language) (speaks foreign language) - And I'm happy to be here at Hulihe'e, and sitting here on the video and talking about the hula. More especially, we're happy to be here at Hulihe'e Palace, where this was also the home of the last Hawaii's ruling monarch, David La'amea Kamanakapu'u Kalakaua, who was responsible for reviving the hula, after being lost for about 75 years in our islands. Kal|kaua believed that the hula is the language of the heart, and, therefore, the heartbeat of the Hawaiian people. Hulihe'e had also served as the home for two of Hawaii's great masters of the hula: the late Lokalia Montgomery, who was a teacher of teachers; and Hawaii's premier dancer, Iolani Luahine. They brought the hula back to Hawaii, the ancient dances, and taught the dances to all Hawaii. I was very fortunate to take lessons and study under both Iolani and Lokalia. Iolani was such a great dancer, you know, she never danced the same song the same way. So, to be able to be a good olapa, you have to watch the dancing, and Iolani danced just at what came, you know, and you have to watch your feet movements, and just this, so that the drum. You feel her, she was so great that sometimes when I chant for her, I get so carried away and I forget, you know, she's dancing and just get into a trance with this lady, she was so great. Auntie Lokalia, being the teacher of teachers, studied she's very, very strict teacher, you know, no talk, no play, no nothing, just work, you know. One time, me and Auntie, Auntie Lokalia was a big woman, at one time I said to her, "Auntie, how come, when you dance, "all the windows don't shake?" She lived in this old house, and when she danced, the windows never shook. So I said, "but how come when I dance, everything shakes?" She said, "Because you're not good yet, that's why." So that answered that question, didn't answer anymore about it. (flute) (chants in foreign language) In the hula, there are different phases of the hula, like going to school, you know, you start at preschool, kindergarten, high school and college. The hula is the same way. It takes many, many years of hard work and learning. And the first phase of the hula, you know, to learn to chant, then to hopa, then become an olapa, a dancer, and from there, you go to another... (speaks a foreign language) Finally, you uniki, or you graduate, graduation from this space, like high school. And, then, you start again, like college, and you begin all over again and be able to become a kuhula, because today, everybody has one uniki, every year, you know. In all my 49 years of teaching, I have given, teaching thousands of youngsters. I've give only six teacher's diplomas in 49 years, so, you know, it's hard work. And I have so many good dancers, but lots of people are good dancers, but not good teachers. Some people are not good dancers, but they're good teachers. I know several like that, you know. (chanting in foreign language) To be able to interpret the dance, you know, like people say, you know this halau does this, and this halau does that. You know, the Hawaiian language, especially in the hula, tells a story, and the important thing is that Hawaiian words mean so many different things. So one teacher would interpret this meaning to fit her or him, and the other one this way and that. So when you watch them dance, somebody says, "Oh, that one's wrong." But it isn't wrong, they're not wrong. They're just doing their own manau with this dance, because the hula, to me, is the ability to create one's most inner feelings. (speaks in a foreign language) - Good afternoon and welcome to Kaleiho Kona. This afternoon, we are here to perform the arts that have been passed on to our generation by Mrs. Lokalia Montgomery. This afternoon, we have presented for you, Halau O Kaleiho'ohie, which is in the true tradition of Hawaiian chant and dance. My name is Nalei Aloha Napaepae-Kunewa, and I am also Keiki Okoinu Okuna, as well as my haumana, and my students are also from Kona, Hawaii. (birds chirp) (chants in a foreign language) (drum) The mele that we will begin with is entitled, A Ka Luna O Pu'uonioni. It is in honor of the goddess Pele. This mele was taught to me by Mrs. Lokalia Montgomery, and it is accompanied with the ili'ili, following A Ka Luna O Pu'uonioni, we will then do Ulei Pahu I Ta Motu, which is a unique hula that speaks about a young Hawaiian man who, for the first time in his life, sees a foreign ship, and it is done with the step that is called the ulili. These dances have been passed on from Mrs. Montgomery to me in our hula halau. (group speaks in foreign language) (percussion) (chanting in foreign language) (drum) (chanting in foreign language) (drum) - When you get the title of being a kumu hula, to me a kumu hula title is, wow! Wow, she's a kumu hula! And I expect you to know all of the deities of the hula. I expect you to know all of the vegetable manifestations of the deities. I expect you to know what kinds of dyes you can make from all of these different vegetable manifestations. I expect you to know how to make different kinds of lei and what the different styles represent, what the different flours represent. I expect you to know how to translate those chants, not only at the literal level, but also the kaunas of the chants as well. To me, that is a kumu hula. So when somebody tells me that there is a kumu hula, I have a great deal of respect for that title, except today the title is being abused. I mean, any Tom, Dick and Harry and Jane and Mary and Sue can be a kumu hula. You know, so they can just go out and learn to dance for a little while. They don't even have to go out, they can just watch it on TV and say, "I can do that!" You know, and then they start practicing, put on their records, start practicing. "I can do this. I'll start teaching!" And so they pull in a lot of students and they start teaching the hula, and then, they, because they are teaching, they are recognized as being a kumu hula. Okay, to me, that is not a kumu hula. (speaks in foreign language) - I am Mrs. Louise Leiomalama Beamer. I was married to my husband, Pono Desha Beamer, way back, so way back, 1923. And I learned all of my hula, everything about the hula I learned, from my mother-in-law, Mrs. Helen Desha Beamer. - I'm Tita Beamer Solomon. This is my mama. I was very privileged to have three kumu hulas, my great-grandmother, Isabela Desha, my grandmother, Helen Desha, and, of course, my mama. Mama taught hula over 50 plus years, and I've taught hula over 40. Mama went off to Bing Crosby, to with Bing Crosby the Waikiki Wedding, and we all went. I shared our hulas with Hollywood. It's a way of life with us, our hula, and we dearly love our hula. Malama? - Aloha, Mai. My name is Malama Solomon, and my sister and I, Hulali, having been dancing hula since we were two years old. - My name is Hulali Solomon Covington, and as my sister said, I am presently the kumu hula for Beamer Solomon Halau O Po'ohala. But because I am also a school teacher, our hula has really been kind of on a part-time basis. Unlike mom and grandma whose emphasis was on the 'auana or the modern hula, I really favor the kahiko, or the ancient hula. And when I teach our halau, I do a lot of work with the wawae or the feet. To me, the feet patterns is what's important. - So we'd like to give you a brief demonstration, and Hulali will choreograph the steps. (drum) (chanting in foreign language) As you can see, in the Beamer Method of hula, we use the heel and the hip. (chanting in foreign language) This is the reach tap. It's on the ball of the feet, and it's connected with the hips. The sway, With the bend of the knee and the straight back. (chanting in foreign language) With the uehe, also we use the heel and the hip. (chanting in foreign language) (speaks in foreign language) * We should be together * In a little hula heaven * Over the silver sea * Gay and free together * In a little hula heaven * Under a koa tree * Days would be lazy * And sweetly crazy * Til skies grew hazy above * And we'd be all alone together * In a little hula heaven * Living a dream of love (orchestral music) (singing in foreign language) * Days would be lazy * And sweetly crazy * Til skies grew hazy above * And we'd be all alone together * In a little hula heaven * Living a dream of love - I've seen the hula change, you know, the styles of hula change, and, of course, you have hula that comes from Oahu and Kauai, you have hula that comes from Molokai, you have hula that comes from Hawaii, and all of these hulas are done in different styles and originally done for different reasons. And, so, you'd expect that our hula would look different. (drum) (chanting in foreign language) (drum) (chanting in foreign language) - Whenever you go to a new place, you have to feel good about that place, so allow the place to come out to you, instead of just going there and taking whatever you can, make a lot of noise, and do whatever, throw things around. Allow the place to come into you, and you feel what that place is all about. (ukulele) (singing in foreign language) - We're here at Ka Ulu O Laka in Ha'ina Ke'e, the most used hula platform on the island of Kauai. In fact, in the state, it's been in continuous use since antiquity. I'm Roselle Bailey. We're the caretakers of this place. Ka Ulu O Laka and Kauluapaoa. We are from the organization called Ka 'Imi Na'auao O Hawai'i Nei, nonprofit tax-exempt organization. Our philosophy in our school is to search for the truth in the Hawaiian culture, and to give the dignity to the Hawaiian culture back to the Hawaiians and for everyone to understand the Hawaiian people, the Hawaiian culture. We take care of this place, and we sponsor Eiho Ola'an here, or Uniki, or Aho'okuku. And that's a major step because this place belongs to antiquity. It is not just mere preservation, it then becomes perpetuation. - This is the district of Kaana on the island of Molokai. And this, in the traditions of Molokai, the birthplace of the hula. It was here, many, many generations ago, that the hula was first performed and kept only within the La'i La'i family. And many people from the outside islands, from Hawaii, Maui, Lanai, Kauai, would come here to his place on the top of Maunaloa in Kaana, to enjoy the hula and watch. Many people for generations came here and wanted to learn this art from this family that dwelt here. And it was during the time of a woman called Pao Ula Kinauhu, who was very skillful in the art of the hula that people came to her, begging her to ask to be taught the dance. So, she agreed and told the people that under the conditions that they would learn the hula, this special gift under her laws and her couples, and the people agreed. And many of them came here to learn, and there were too much for Kapoa Ula Kinao to handle. So to help her with the amounts of people that came here to learn the hula, she had taught her youngest sister, and her youngest sister learned the hula very, very quickly. And, at the completion of her work in the hula, Kapoa Ula Kinahu Unikitu, graduated her sister, and gave her three names by which she was to be known and would teach the hula by. The first name was Ulu Nui, and the second name was Laia, and the third name was Laka. And by those three names, she left, and Laka left the top of Maunaloa here, and journeyed westward to the island of Niihau. And there, she spread the hula. Then, moving to Kauai, then Maui back track to Lanai, and then off in the distance to the Big Island. And when she reached the Big Island, (speaks a foreign language) She was very old and, there, she spread the hula there. And after knowing that she was soon to die, she returned here, back to Kaana to live out the rest of her days. And when she died, the people buried her under this hill that we are sitting here, Punana. And after her death, the people praised, Mulu Ka'i as Mulu Ka'i Kahula Piko, which means Mulu Ka'i the center of the dance. And as generations became far removed from the reality of Laka, they began to elevate her and deify her unto a goddess as she is known today. This particular hula is an honor of Laka and speaks of her travels from island to island, done in punana. We do for you Huli Ana O Laka I Lehua Moe. (drum) (chants in foreign language) On the wind-swept plains of Kauluapaoa, is a small hill that is called Pu'u Li'i, and on this hill, as legend goes, was the home of a dog god, whose name was Poki Komanumanu. And he was very helpful to the fishermen, and the fishermen would go out past the hill and into the ocean to fish. If there was danger, the dog would howl in the wind. And when the old Hawaiians heard this howling in the wind, they would quickly come back into shore, for they knew that there would be danger approaching. And during times of war, the dog god Poki Komanumanu would turn himself into a giant cloud, which covered the whole flats of Kauluapaoa, and as the enemy approached, this thick fog would appear, and they would lose their way, many times crashing into the reef losing their lives. And the people loved this dog, and they created this chant in memory and in honor of this dog god Poki Komanumanu. And within the chant, because of the howling of this dog, the chant is interwoven with howling, glorifying the dog god Poki Komanumanu of Kauluapaoa. (drum) (chants in foreign language) (howls) (chants in foreign language) (howls) (chants in foreign language) (howls) (chants in foreign language) (howls) (chants in foreign language) (breathes heavily) (chants in foreign language) (breathes heavily) (chants in foreign language) (howls) (chants in foreign language) (breathes heavily) (chants in foreign language) (breathes heavily) (chants in foreign language) (howls) (chants in foreign language) (howls) (chants in foreign language) - Many people write songs, but the hula is not like any other kind of dancing, you know, ballet's ballet, and what they did 150 years ago, the same ballet is the same thing 150 years ago. But the hula changes, because each teacher, every day is new sounds, every day the teacher must create a new song. And many of them don't speak the language, so they take out the dictionary and literally take these songs and put it together. Some ladies would say, "Oh, that halau is not doing right, "and this halau is." They are still doing it right because they are translating the song. Hawaiian songs mean so many things, but what was the intent of the composer is important. So if he doesn't know the kauna or the hidden word in this particular chant or song, the songs doesn't go through, or else, if you're lucky enough to know the composer, then you know the manau of the composer. - The sounds that I do are mostly the older songs, and when I do these songs, most of the older people get up and really dance and sing to them. But, today, we have a tradition. We're honoring the young. We want the young to follow in the steps of the old people, and the song that were doing today is Moani Keala. It's done for an area around the volcano. It's about a, it's a cold area, it's about a cold wind, but a friendly wind, and the sky's enlightening this girl to this friendly wind, which says, (speaks a foreign language) Hey, it said, "Here you are." It says, "You're so cold but I know you're friendly." It said, "You're gonna do anything, "let's do it before it's too late." (ukulele) (sings in foreign language) - Today, when students come to our halau, they really expect to be dancing all over the floor and doing kaholo here and moving all about. But when I was young, we did normal hulas, which meant you sat on the floor, and normal hula is a sitting dance. And in a sitting dance, it's very different because you have to memorize all the words of the mele. You don't have someone else chanting for you. And I went through that for about three years, but I was really pakiki, real... (speaks in foreign language) I stuck it out not matter what. That's what I wanted, and I stuck it out, and I'm happy I did. Here we have a noho hula, a sitting dance, using the puniu, the coconut shell knee drum. The dancers will tell you the story of Kiha Wahini, immortal, the goddess of the island of Maro. (drums) (chanting in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) This is my husband, Charles Kauluwehi Maxwell, and he's really my support. Sometimes, I feel I'm just tired, he's like, no, you can do it again, you know. He's the ahola of the halau, full of joy and help and always there, giving me his kakua, which I deeply appreciate it. Sometimes, we don't tell them, you know. But I do. - There's so many different types of so-called kahiko hula that I think we're losing the essence of the traditional form of hula, which is the original olapa that was brought by the Pele Sisters from Tahiti long ago. (drum) - The Pahu was a very, very important instrument in the hula. And during ancient times, the pahu was used for ceremonial dances, sacred dances performed in the temples in ancient Hawaii. And these dances were performed only by the men. These dances were known as the hula pahu, hula meaning the dance and, of course, pahu, the drum. As the chanter or the priest beat upon the drum, to the ancients, it sounded like thunder in the heavens, or it sounded like the crash of the waves upon the shore. And these are the natural sounds of nature, the force and the power of nature, and the hula is nature. It is the force and imitative of nature through man's body. And so these two things, these two forces, these two natural forces blended together evenly, and that is why the pahu and the dance were so sacred and so important to be put together. (chanting in foreign language) (drums) (speaking in a foreign language) (drums) - Actually, I think what the problem is, is the language. I know when I was growing up, and I was a young girl, a lot of people spoke the language. Today, they're speaking the language, but they're speaking more a book language, and if you take what your kupuna told you, and you take what the book tell you, it may vary. And so, they're having this pilikia, this problem, since the audience does not know the language. They're gonna really dramatize the dance to get it across, to get the message across. Before, just one wink of the eye, and a little lift of the eyebrow, no more need be said, right? But that's the problem that we have, the language, and if you take the simplicity and work on it, I think you can get the message across. Original, the way it was. - Upon the death of David Kalakaua, his sister Liliuokalani inherited the Hawaiian throne. Along with the regality, she inherited, too, the troubles of this little Hawaiian kingdom. (dancers speak in foreign language) (drum) (dancers chant in foreign language) In 1881, when David Kalakaua traveled on his famous world tour, his sister the princess Liliuokalani took over duties as regent to the Hawaiian kingdom. (dancers chant in foreign language) And one of her first duties was to travel upon the royal train Lanakila to oversee her kingdom. And it was true that she traveled from Honolulu to Mawanalua and then beyond to Halawa. (dancers chant in foreign language) Upon her journey, as she glanced about the country, she marveled at the beauty of these Hawaiian islands. Glancing about on that journey, she marveled to see the great industry of her people. It didn't take long before the train arrived at Mainana. The place called Pearl City and this island called Oahu. It wasn't long, and the people had been waiting for her arrival since morning. She spoke once to the conductor, "Let us bring our train to a stop here at Manana." (dancers chant in foreign language) And, there, upon her arrival, the citizens and the native-borns of Hawaii honor Pearl. Great aloha. To acknowledge her presence, the cheers of aloha, for she was their royal ali'i. And as the train departed there for Honoulukili, swaying back and forth, she waved and cheered on by her subjects. There, at the archway of the train, where she stood, turning this way and that way, with greetings of aloha. And, so praises are sung to honor her name, the name of Liliuokalani, the last ruling monarch of Hawaii. And we will honor the names of our ali'i to the dance and the art of hula. And so the hula will continue to live on among the young of Hawaii. (dancers speak in foreign language) (drum) - The hula is the most important part of the Hawaiian culture. What we have now is remnants of that past culture, but it's so important, because everything else of the culture has been obliterated by the Western culture, has been intermingled, has been diluted. So, if our hula is also diluted, then we have nothing pure to go back to. - You know, I'm really a stickler for keeping things traditional, especially the hula kahiko. And know what, kahiko is self-explanatory, and it means of the old. But, today, lots of people write chants and called this kahiko. It isn't if you wrote the thing last month. But someday it will be kahiko, because then, it will be old, 50 years from now, 75 years from now. It's just like our chants we have today. But we don't want to discourage these young people from writing. This is very important that they carry on. But what I think they should be writing about, instead of writing about something old, because it has already been handed down to us already, they should be writing about things happening today, so there will be some kind of history of Hawaii. (Hawaiian music) (singing in foreign language) - [Voiceover] One, two, three, four, up, down. Aloha! (applause) - As I said earlier, they can stand on here, as far as I'm concerned. (mumbles) But kahiko, keep it traditional. So that at least we have something that still belongs to Hawaii, and the hula is Hawaii. The hula is the history of Hawaii. Remember, we had no written language. Everything was put in your mind, you have to remember, handed down from one generation to the next generation each time. - Even if other things are being introduced to us, which, you know, I don't necessarily like, the continuation of hula is important. (speaks a foreign language) - This is a hula pahu. It's a very old chant, a traditional chant, and it has an important message. It's a prophesy, and it tells the people of Hawaii to hold on to your culture. It is very, very important. Hold, hold fast. (drums) (group chants in foreign language) (drums) (group chants in foreign language) (drums) - Ladies and gentlemen, (speaks in foreign language) thank you for joining us here at the Kamokila Campbell Hula Festival here at Lanikuhonua. Our next halau to perform for you under the direction of their kumu hula, Lydia Kauakahi, please welcome. Halau Kahanuola A Me Ka'ehukai, and the musical accompaniment of I Kona. (Hawaiian music) (singing in foreign language) (applause)
