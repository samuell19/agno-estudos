[Indistinct chanting] [Indistinct chanting] So I don't know what Scott's doing in there, but I mean, you can hear him in there like... He's saying something, he's like chanting some weirdass stuff I don't know He's been in there for like two days I mean, I know he's in there, I just... He's doesn't come out, I keep knocking I keep texting him, calling him and I don't know Okay, so I just heard a scream in there and it wasn't-- *SCREAM* Oh shit! Holy shit! What the hell?! Oh my God, Joe! Joe! What are you doing in here?! Stop filming! What are you doing in here?! Joe! Stop right now! Stop filming! Jesus Christ! Okay, so these assholes were summoning a demon in my own house. A Goetia, Joe. It's called a Goetia, not a demon. Whatever, same thing. You were summoning a Goetia You weren't supposed to come in the door! in my own house without even telling me! You were the one that interrupted the ritual, okay! Guys! stop, stop! Alright, look. Me and Lena have not eaten for like two days, alright. We need food. You got this... soup? Soup? Looks like you've got some here Yeah, uh Can we get some of this? Yeah, I just made that, so Soup's on Look, uh, can you just save some for me? Yes, Joe. Yeah. Yeah, I just made it. So I don't know I don't know if I believe in this stuff but I don't know if I want to believe in this stuff either, you know? You'll be fine, Joe. Fine? How will I be fine? You just said there's a demon loose in this house. No, it's not loose in the house. It's loose in the world. Well, it could be loose in the house too. It could be but you'll be fine, Joe. Stop freaking out. Oh yeah, yeah. So I'm gonna be fine... They said I'm gonna be fine because of my religion like but everybody else is, you know, kinda screwed. Joe, the only one who could actually be affected by this is Scott. Yeah, Joe. I'm the only one who has anything to lose. Alright? Potentially, this demon can actually jump into Scott's body. Um, no. Joe, can you stop filming already? We don't want anyone seeing this. Stop telling him to stop filming, alright We've been doing this thing for two days. You were the one who was supposed to put the sign on the door. Don't give me that shit, you fucking bitch!! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa, dude. Um, Joe, can I talk to you for a second? Whoa, Scott, what's going on, man? Um, Joe, let me just talk to you for one second... Jesus, what's happening? Oh my God If you're gonna look at me, then film me! That's not Scott. What?! Film me! That's not Scott. What do you mean that's not Scott? I mean the demon jumped inside him. Don't listen to that bitch! Whoa, Scott! You can't be talking like this out here. And why's that, Mr. YouTube? Because the cops will get called on us. And what are those bitches gonna do? What?! They'll taze you! Mr. Funnyman afraid of a little electricity? Yes! Wait wait wait wait wait wait wait Hold on, hold on Scott Scott, are you a demon? Yes, he is! Who are you, and what is-- *SLAP* Whoa! Jesus! Whoa, Scott! What the hell's going on with you, man? Scott?! Scott! *GROWL* Whoa shit!!! Oh my God! Hurry hurry hurry hurry! Please please please! Oh my God! Hurry! Hurry! Oh shit! Scott! Holy shit, Scott! We need to get to Eagle Rock. Come on, we need to get to Eagle Rock! What?! What are you talking about?! Scott! I've got his keys. Let's go. Where is he going? He's gonna try to get in through the front, I guess. Oh my God, we've got to meet him! We need to meet him! Here, take this. What? Hurry. Why am I holding this? Just trust me. I'll tell you in the car, okay? What? And this. Wait a minute. Is he really possessed? Yes, he is. That's why we're taking these things. Okay? Let's go. Chop chop! I forgot something. Wait, why don't you just get a priest? Um, because a priest has never, not once, successfully exorcised a demon from the human body. If it appears to have happened, it would likely happen because the demon got tired of feeling the pain of the human body as it began deteriorating from malnourishment. Okay? What about Jesus? Jesus wasn't a Catholic, nor a Christian. What are you talking about? Sure he was. No, Joe. Christ's followers were Christian. Jesus was a Jew or more importantly, a Kabbalist. Jews and Christians do not have the tools to control spirits. What's a Kabbalist? Kabbalists are Jewish mystics. Wait, so Jesus was a mystic? Yes. He was. Wait wait wait wait wait I need another camera. Why? Uh, Joe, we cannot film this. Yes! Look! The tripods are already set up. Okay? Yeah, I see that, but we don't need to film this. No, no, I just need another camera. I just want to put this here. Look, the tripod's already set up from the last shoot. They're already in the car. I see that. Please. Joe, come on! Okay. Here, take this. Why? Oh, God. What are you gonna do with the footage, Joe? I don't know. Well, are you gonna post it? I don't know. Look, I promise you... Look, I promise you I'll tell you before I do. Okay? I told you, the tripod is already set up. Before you post it, you'll promise me to tell me before you post it, when I don't want you to post it Yes, I'll let you know. Joe! Oh my God. So is Scott gonna be out there? Uh, yeah, actually he might be if he got in through the front. Is he gonna hurt somebody? No, just me. Wait. Why not me? I mean, if you try and get involved, then yes. But no, he's really just after me. So why is he after you? Does it matter? You wouldn't believe me if I told you. I'm turning this camera off. Wait, no no no, why?! Joe, I can tell the only reason you're filming this is cause you're gonna post it. Look, I promise you, okay. I promise you... I'll show you the footage. Okay? I'll let you know before I post it. Yeah yeah yeah, right, K Dude, I'm seriously freaked out right now. Oh my God! Keep filming!!! Oh my God! Just fucking drive, Joe! Oh my God! Oh my mother! Oooohh!! Okay What are you doing? I just need a moment. Okay? This is crazy. Um, yeah, it is. This is crazy. Lena, you understand that the cops are being called on Scott right now. Yes, I know, but the further that we get from him, the better. What are you talking about?! He is freaking out! We just need to get to Eagle Rock. Okay? We'll be fine. He'll be fine. How will he be fine? Just trust me, Joe. The further that we get away from him, the better that he will get. How? Why?! Joe, that stuff in your bag that stuff in your bag that I asked you to take is the only stuff that was in the circle when we performed the ritual. That stuff is the closest thing to the Goetia when we summoned it, so it is most attracted to the stuff. Yes, I understand that! Why did you bring it with us? We need the Goetia to finish the ritual. Lena, I don't want to be anywhere near this Goetia! I'm aware. I don't want any part of this. Okay? I just came home... I just heard a scream, that's it. That's all! And then you opened the door, and completely ruined the ritual. Completely! Whatever! Why don't you do this yourself? Just take, like, an Uber or Lyft or something? No I need you Okay? Just do it. Okay Wait a minute Wait a minute Did you stage this? What? No, Joe. We didn't stage this. This is something you would do. Ha! Joe, I am not messing with you. We did not stage this. You can't stage this shit! What do you mean? This is totally something-- What do I mean? Joe, I just need a ride to Eagle Rock. I will give you gas money. I will pay for your next whatever. Let's just get to Eagle Rock, please. This is very important. OK, OK, fine. Here, film. Film me. God, okay then, thank you. I will film if you drive me, how bout that? Okay Please, I just want to get to Eagle Rock. Keep filming! Keep filming! Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my fucking God! Jesus! Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God! What the fuck is going on today?! Joe! Joe! Damn! That was the Goetia! Oh my God, I need to call someone. I need to call someone. Can all these guys turn psychotic?! Oh my God, this is filming too. Okay so, the reason that it was okay to summon a demon in my house was because these idiots made a sign. Here. See. Joe: We're OK, please don't open the door, we're summoning a Goetia and if you open this door, you'll let it out. And see how I taped it like that See how easy it is? And the reason I say that is because these guys forgot to tape it Scott was supposed to do it, Joe. How would he forget to do something like that?! I don't know! I don't know! We don't have to go over this. *KNOCKING* Oh my God What did I tell you?! Andrew! What did I tell you?! Dammit, Lena! I told you, you do not have the kind of experience to do something like this! Scott said he knew what he was doing. Scott doesn't know what the fuck he's doing either! God! Where's the ground? Right here. What the f--?! All of that?! Yeah Lena, you don't need all of that! I'm sorry, I didn't know. Wait, you don't know how to do this? You told me you knew how to do this. You said you did it before. Oh! You've done this before! Just three times with Scott. Okay, Joe. Listen to me. I need you to take all that grounded items drive somewhere far away from here and burn it all. Wait, what?! I'm not gonna do that. It's California! Joe, you have to, okay? This is way too much stuff. Look, did either one of you run into any trouble on the way here? Yeah, that psychotic guy. And Scott. And Scott? Look Joe, I really, really need you to do this, okay? Just go somewhere remote and burn it all. Wait, are you staying here? No, look, Lena and I need to go finish the ritual. Wait. Can you film it? What the fuck? No! Joe, absolutely not! No! Look, that's the only reason I'm doing this! Well then you shouldn't be doing this! Fuck! Let's go guys. Alright Joe, you know what you're doing? Yeah, yeah, I know what I'm doing. You know, Andrew I had no idea that that you were into this, kinda, like, magic stuff. Oh. Oh yeah, man. I love this shit. Actually I've been doing it since I was, like, 5 years old. You know? Just kinda raised into it. Nice. Well, I had no idea. Yeah, definitely, definitely. Alright man, well, after you burn all this stuff just come back and find us. We're gonna be at the top of the mountain finishing the ritual. Sounds good. Perfect. Oh hey, um. Real quick. Here. Uh, just make sure that's playing at all times and you should be fine. Okay, great. Let's go, Lena. I may or may not have just done something incredibly illegal. I mean, I'm not saying I did anything, I'm not saying I didn't, but that thing is incr-- Hey man, hey I'm sorry but, can you give me a ride, man? My car broke down. What?! No, I can't get you a ride! Just a little help. Where is she? Is she on the mountain? What?! Screw you, dude! Look, I'm sorry for slapping her. I was just trying to knock some sense into her. I just need to talk to her! Wait! Wait! Jesus Christ! Holy shit, dude! Holy shit! Holy shit, ok. I guess I was supposed to be playing this music it's like warding off warding off these guys. Let's hear this. What the hell is this? Hold on. What the hell? What the hell is this crap? Maybe the next track is better. Hold on. Let me hear this. Holy shit, dude. Holy shit. I can still hear it. Oh my God. Do you see that? Holy shit, dude. Okay Dude, I can still hear it! Oh, there it goes. There it goes. Okay, yeah. There it goes. Okay, so that's how far. Way over there. That's how far it is. Did you do it? Nope. What?! We gotta find Scott. What?! Why?! We need Scott. Look Joe, I don't want to be saying this shit out in public. I'll tell you in the car. Sorry, sorry. So what's going on with Scott? He's a demon, Joe. Yes! Yes, we know that. No, Joe, I mean he is full possessed. Look, Scott is "the ground". Which means that you just burned all that shit for no reason. HOLY SHIT!!! Joe, why are you filming this? Because! Look, Joe, I don't want this filmed! Well then I'm not driving you around. You took a Lyft here, why don't you take one back? Come on, Joe. Jesus Christ. You just You just said that my best friend is a demon, and you don't expect me to film?! Come on, Joe. Look, unfortunately, we need you now more than ever. You know, in fact, I don't think we can do this without you. What? Yeah. Well then I'm filming! Here, take this, help me film. Okay, fine. But promise me you won't post this. Okay? I do not want people to see the rituals. Alright? Not without at least knowing the basics. They're gonna end up just like Lena, and then there'll be situations like this EVERYWHERE! Okay? I promise. I'll let you see the footage and I won't post the rituals. Alright then. Fine. I wanna know what the hell's going on. Well, it's pretty simple. You see, Scott and Lena summoned a fucking demon without knowing what the fuck they were actually doing. You said you weren't gonna help us, so... You guys are young, OK? You don't need help. Just cause we're young doesn't mean that we don't need help, or money. Wait, what?! Mm, yeah yeah yeah, they summoned a demon for money. What?! You summoned a demon for money in my house? No, for an acting role. Wait a minute, you potentially sacrificed your soul for an acting role in my house?! Honestly Joe, it's not that big of a deal. It happens all the time, but you just gotta know what you're doing. Look, people do it for all sorts of reasons. You could summon a Goetia to cure a disease, or to make sure your favorite team wins a big game. But you just, you gotta be careful, because if you don't know what you're doing it could potentially end up controlling you, like it's doing with Scott right now. Why do we need to find Scott then? Cause Scott is the demon. The demon is up there! No, Joe Scott is the demon. Andrew, that guy attacked me! Okay, I understand that, but it doesn't work like that. It's not like in the comic books, or in the movies. Different demons do different things, Joe. Some demons, like this one, can possess multiple people at the same time. But the main person the demon has possessed, the person who did the ritual wrong who is Scott, who is "the ground" the physical thing that is tying them to this world. That's why the sign wasn't on the door, Joe. Scott had already been possessed, and he took the sign down and since Lena was in the circle when the circle was broken, she is now the one the demon is trying to kill. These other guys are just like side effects, like a demonic radiation. Dude! Dude! That's the guy right there! Drive Joe! Jesus Christ! Get us the fuck out of here! Aaaahhh!!!! Oh my God, Oh my God Oh my God, he's fucking right here! He's following us! Shit! Go! Go! Oh my God, Oh my God! You really fucked us, Lena. Do you have any idea how fucked we are right now? This is a really bad one! Oh my God, I'm sorry, okay? I thought we could handle it. This is such a powerful Goetia! I thought we could handle it! Jesus Christ. I really thought so! Okay, I admit. Over the head. Jesus, man. You know what? Every Goetia should not be taken lightly, Lena! But this one? This is a real fuckin bad one. I get it. I get it. I hope you do. I guess Lena thought this specific demon would be, like, weak or something like that like, easier to work with but it turns out it actually turns out it's, like, one of the strongest ones. Lena, um Why did you Why did you scream when you were in the room? How the fuck could you let Scott cut you, Lena?! I didn't! Yeah, that's cause Joe broke the circle. He just saved your fuckin' life! God. Why does it want to kill Lena? Power. If it kills Lena before we finish the ritual, then she'll be... My soul will forever be linked to the demon until it's killed. Wait, are you gonna kill Scott?! No, Joe, what are you talking about? No, we're going to exorcise him so that the spirit isn't just roaming around in the world and then we'll finish the ritual. But how would you kill a demon? You can't, Joe. So you'll just be stuck with it forever?! Joe, it's not gonna happen! Look, they did this ritual three times. First time, it didn't work. Second time, Scott got possessed. And on the third time, Scott's gonna try to kill Lena, so we gotta find him. You know, Lena. I've never been in a situation where I'm like, literally, I'm like going after a demon. How many times do I have to say sorry? I don't know. I've never done this before. I have no basis for comparison. Alright, guys! This isn't helping. Can we just find Scott? Okay, so we're here and we have to go find Scott. There's a slight chance he made it through the gate and he's actually looking for us, so... The first place he'd look for us is maybe in the apartment so I guess that's the first place we're gonna look for him. I just want this to be over with, y'know? It's crazy. It's actually kind of easy, I mean, all we have to do is grab him and say-- *BEEP* Hey! What'd I tell you? Sorry. I told you, don't say that. Sorry, I guess I'm not supposed to say that. But it is kind of easy though, I mean... Um, no, actually it's kinda not easy, okay? Trust me, these things never go the way you want them to. Wait, but all we need to do is, Lena just needs to touch him and then say... *BEEP* Stop! Don't say it, Joe. Just don't say it. Trust me, don't underestimate this thing. Jesus, sorry. It's gonna be harder. Oh shit, is that one of them?! LENA!! Yup. Oh shit! Oh shit! Lena, get the gate open! Come on, Lena! Holy shit! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! LENA!!! Oh my God! LENA!! Go, go! Come on, Andrew! Come on! Dammit, Joe. Why the fuck did you give me this camera? I told you I don't want to film this shit. I need both my hands. We can't have-- You're the one knowledgable. We get it, guys. Both of you, seriously. Both of us? What the fuck did I do? He could be right inside. You're the one who fucking called me, Lena. God! Stay right there. Just hold on. Alright, go. It's all your fucking fault, Lena. Just be quiet. He's right here. He's right here!! Oh my God!! Oh my God! Um... Stop! Stop! Stop! Put your hand on him! Stop! Stop! Stop! Aaaaahhhhh!!!! Oh shit! OH SHIT!! Get him down! Get his arms! AAAAAAHHHHHHH!!!!!!! [Indistinct chanting] [heavy breathing] Man. Hey Joe. Are these your clothes? Yeah, those are mine. He's gonna need to put these on. He's drenched. He is drenched. Scott, are you okay? Is that you, Scott? It's me. Oh my God! This is single handedly the craziest thing I've ever experienced. I mean, in all my years of going to church I've never seen anything like this before. I mean, we had a guy that was possessed... he claimed he was... He was just a meth addict, though. I don't know, man. *GROWL* WHOA JEEZ!! Whoa hey! Joe! Holy shit! Hey, you know what happened Joe? Dude! There was a guy! There was a guy right there! Don't worry. There was a guy right there! I know, I know, that just means it's worked, okay? It's a spirit. We did it! WHOA! WHOOAA!! WHOOAA!!! Easy! Joe, it's just me. Okay. You good? Yeah, just a little jumpy. I get it. Look man, I was listening the whole time. I'm not deaf, Joe. Look, you said it yourself. The guy was acting like a meth head. If there actually was a demon in that guy, and it did leave, the only reason it left was, either because it was annoyed, or simply because it didn't like the way the body felt anymore cause of malnourishment. You know, it's almost funny with you religious people how you always seem to forget that the human body still needs food and water, even when it's being possessed. What?! If my religion is so funny, then why did you need my help? Why haven't I been possessed yet then? Well, that's easy. Because your religion gives you protection, Joe. Yeah, that's right. My God protects me. It's not really your God, alright? First of all, there's no real evidence that your God ever even existed, okay? So, it's not your God that protects you. What protects you is your feelings, and you got those feelings from the teachings that they gave to you at church. Look, the electrical pulses in your mind, they send out a frequency into the world. You with me? Yeah. Like the law of attraction? No, Joe! No! The law of attraction is complete bull shit. Okay? Look, the frequencies that you operate at, they vibrate at the level of a fucking tree. So, it's not really that you chose the right God, it's just simply that you were too afraid to actually experience life. Alright? They vibrate as much as this jeep. A plant has had just as an eventful life as you, Joe. And that is why you're protected. Hey, all I know is your religion... Your religion made a demon go into my best friend's body. My religion did nothing. That was ignorance, Joe! Those guys didn't know what the fuck they were doing. And you know what, it is ignorance that has made you live a life of just following the rules. Joe, look at me. What have you done with your life, huh? You've wasted it! Making these stupid fucking documentaries and Internet videos! And when your videos were unsuccessful, what'd you do? You went and you prayed to a painting of Jesus. Hey, I pray to no one. I am in control of my own existence. And I'm the one who just saved your best friend's fucking life. LENA!! Oh my God! LENA!!! Get in the car! Holy shit, dude! Holy shit! Drive! Drive! Drive! Drive! *SCREAMS* Jesus! Holy crap! Oh my God! Go faster! Faster! Faster! Jesus Christ! Holy shit! It's okay! It's okay! It's okay! Holy fuck! What the hell was that? Jesus Christ! Holy shit! Scott, are you okay? Tired. But, uh, getting better though. Why didn't you just stay home? I mean, the demon can't possess you twice, right? You're okay. You could have just stayed home and rested. No, he's fine, but he cannot stay. He actually needs our protection. The demon could still use him for collateral. Come on, Joe. Get that fucking camera out of his face. Whoa, what are we doing? Look, I'd rather not say. What? Why? Because I don't want people to know where this is. What? What are we doing here, Andrew? We need to finish the ritual. Yeah, I know, but we need something first, okay? Jesus Christ! I just want to be done with this, you know? Yeah, I get it. I want to be done too, but we gotta get this first. Why are you making me do these things?! I thought this was gonna be over! It's okay, Joe. I don't know anything about this! Look, I'm sorry to do this to you, Joe, but I need you to get this thing. It's a cursed rock of Dee. There's actually a demon inside the rock. Wait, what?! Look, I'm sorry Joe, but I need you to do this. What the hell are you talking about?! You're working with two demons now?! The rock is bad. You are good. Bad. Good. Combine it, it makes things even, alright? And you need to scream out-- This is very important, Joe. Scream out, "Adam, I accept you!" What?! And remember, you can't reject it in any form, but you can't break it open either. You just have to... deal with it. Alright. Good luck, man. I believe in you. Wait, so how long is he actually gonna be out there? Eh, I don't know, hard to say, maybe like 6, 8 hours. 6...hours?! It's fine. Look, we gotta give Scott some food. Yeah, me too. Yeah, let's do it. Alright. I have to walk just right over there and yell out these words. Okay. I don't want to do this. You know what, Andrew? Sometimes you can be a damn asshole, you know that? I don't want to do this, okay? You're working with two demons now?! Those things you say to me makes it sound like my life doesn't matter! You know, whoever's watching this, you know why... Okay. He didn't want to tell us where he was going... where our location was... It's because Andrew is a part of this witch coven, okay? And this place that he's sending me is where they put all of their cursed objects that they don't know what to do with. So they just march up here and just drop them out here and just walk back, where anyone can find them. Okay? And you know what, screw it! I don't know where we are, but it's somewhere off of, like, a road off of Interstate 210. Okay, I should have been paying attention. Goddammit! Whoa. Holy crap. I'll have your pickles if you don't want them. Yeah, I'll give you some pickles. Hell yeah. How you doing, Scott? Doing a lot better after this. Good. You have another burger too, so... Okay. Okay, this is I think this is enough. Okay, let me just put some stuff down. Okay, guys. I just walked I just marched all the way up here, where I used to be pointing. There's the highway It's off of 210, so Andrew, you can screw yourself. This is where all the items are. And that right there is, I don't know... I think that's Highway 2. I really should have been paying attention. Just... It's hard to actually focus right now just because the crap that I've seen has seriously has made me has honestly made me second guess everything that I've ever been taught. So, it's just... This is bullshit. It's bullshit. Adam? Adam, I accept you! GREETINGS!! Holy shit! I AM HERE!! Where?! HERE Holy shit, dude. This is so messed up. HERE Where?! Holy shit. I see it. I see it right fucking there. Holy shit. Okay! Okay! Right there. Holy shit. Can you hear me? YES Holy shit, dude. Can you see me? YES Whoa!! Holy shit. What am I wearing? WHITE SHIRT Oh my God! Okay, let's just put this in our pocket. Okay, let's just go back. YES PLEASE FREE ME Okay, yeah, whatever dude! I'm not gonna do that! Okay? I'm not gonna frickin' do that, so just stop... Jesus Christ Did I drop it? Damn, dude! Dude, I frickin' dropped it! Holy shit, dude. Dude, did I mess this up? Adam?! Adam, I accept you! Shit, man. Did I mess this up, man? Dude, I screwed this up! Adam? Adam? Adam, I accept you! GREETINGS It's right there! Holy shit, dude. Holy shit Okay, I can hear you. Okay, okay, yes. PLEASE FREE ME Okay. Put this in my pocket. PLEASE FREE ME Okay... Let's just go back down. Go back down. Adam, how did you die? BURNED AT THE STAKE What?! By who? THE CHRISTIANS Man, Adam, that's horrible. And who put you in the crystal? JOHN DEE What? So you've been in this crystal for like 500 years? YES PLEASE FREE ME I will! I will, just give me a moment, okay? WHEN Just wait a little bit, okay? Very soon. I HAVE GOLD What do you mean, you have gold? BURIED IN ENGLAND Okay, we have gold. Then I will definitely free you when this is all done. NOW Wait, if I free you, won't you just jump in my body? NO What happens when I break open the crystal? I WILL BE FREE And then how will you get me the gold? I WILL SHOW YOU How?! FREE ME Okay! Okay, Jesus! Fine! Here, fine! Look, Adam, I'm sorry. Just a little bit later, okay? Just a little bit later. Okay, I'm so close. It's just right there. This is not the way I came though. FREE ME Yes, I hear you. FREE ME No, I will. Okay? Just wait a second please. Whoa! Whoa! Ah! Whoa! FREE ME Yes, okay. FREE ME!!! FREE ME!!! Okay, Okay! I will! FREE ME!!! Yes! Yes! Okay! FREE ME!!! FREE ME!!! FREE ME!!! Okay!! FREE ME!!! FREE ME!!! FREE ME!!! Look, Joe, I don't even want to hear what it said, okay? We got your food. We gotta go. So, what actually makes a demon a demon? Well, they're just beings that feel like they still need to do something in this world. I really don't know what that means. Well, I mean, all Goetians aren't quite evil, you know? Some just want to feel what it's like to live in our world again, and they're just not really supposed to be here. Some Goetians feel like they didn't get to accomplish things when they were alive in this world, and others use this world to travel to other worlds, but, regardless, they're just not supposed to be here. Wait, so what does this demon want? I can't tell you that. What?! Why? Because what it wants is too closely related to its name. And I don't want to say its name. Look Joe, the Goetia just wants to make amends, okay? What?! Yeah. It sort of just wants to say sorry. You know, not all Goetians lived in this world, but the one that we're dealing with, he actually did. In fact, he was once a king. He had hundreds of wives and hated every single one of them. He hated women. He treated them like complete shit. And that's why a lot of women will actually summon to work with him. Wait, what?! Yeah. It just wants forgiveness, Joe. And Lena used this thing to become an actress?! Yeah! Alright? I don't like to work with this one. Trust me. Dude, we're the bad guys here! Yeah, again, I've never worked with this one. What happens when it gets forgiveness? Honestly, I don't know. That's all it wants, so once that happens, maybe it'll just go on to the next world. How?! Look, it just needs one woman to forgive it. I mean, to truly express forgiveness. What?! Lena, when this is all over, why don't you just forgive this thing? We can't, Joe. We have to finish the ritual before we can forgive it. Wait a minute, you're telling me you could have forgiven this thing this entire time and we could have avoided all of this crap?! Joe, we are so close. Let's just do this. Just get it over with. Lena, we are the bad guys here, okay? We are the villains in this situation, man. How long has this demon been a demon? 30,000 years, give or take. 30,000 years?! Lena! Why don't you just forgive this thing and release it, so this can all be over? Joe, it slapped me. No! It slapped you?! What about that time you got drunk and slapped me? You haven't even said sorry for that yet. Joe, it grabbed me. Lena! Every weekend you get drunk and you inappropriately grab me, and sometimes you do it right in front of your boyfriend. Enough, okay? I get it. You know, I was thinking cause this thing was never saying, like, "I'm going to kill you, I'm going to kill you," y'know? I mean, it kept saying stuff like "Keep filming! Film this! Film me!" It's a demon, Joe. Oh what, it's not a Goetia anymore? You know what I mean. But it was trying to... It was saying sorry up there. It said "I'm sorry for slapping her," you know? Like I said, they're not all evil, but that doesn't change the fact that they're not supposed to be here. I don't know, it's just, 30,000 years. I mean, that would be hell! I mean, don't you guys feel sorry for this thing? You know what, not really! It's a fucking demon, and it needs to go. Joe, can he fucking stop now? I don't like the camera in my face. Can he just, please, can we put the fucking cameras away? Okay, fine, fine. So this is it, huh? This is where we're doing it? Can you believe this? Lena! Holy shit, dude. Lena! Oh shit! Wait, hey! Lena, I need to talk to you!! I need to talk to you! Stop, please! Just stay right there. Just talk to here right there. Whoa!! Hey! Lena, please forgive me! I'm sorry! Lena!! Lena!! We're not all that bad, I swear! I'm sorry for what your father did to you! I'm sorry for what your ex-boyfriend did! Lena, do it now! Do it! I forgive you! I forgive you. I forgive you. Holy shit! Holy shit! Holy shit! Lena, are you okay? Holy shit. Dude, are you okay? Are you cool now? Yeah. Where am I? Where are you? You don't remember anything? Scott, you good? Yeah, we're all good. Did we all get that on camera, for real? Yeah. So you really don't remember anything? No. Watch out. Last thing I remember, I was just at the grocery store shopping for something and then I wake up here. Holy shit. I'm so exhausted. I feel like something entered my body or something. I feel so drained. Watch out. Holy shit, man. This is seriously the craziest day of my entire life. Where am I? Where are we? You're on Eagle Rock. Okay, so this is amazing what's going on right now. See all these people here? We don't even know each other. The only thing we have in common is that they were all possessed by a demon. Yeah, see, there's Q. I learned his name's Q, he's a really nice guy. One moment they're trying to kill us, and now we're just hanging out. We saw most of these guys here Most of them, lying on the sidewalk down there. We just came back and we just found them. And now we had to explain to them what was going on and we just told them, and now they're up here just chilling out. We're just boozing it up and drinking, it's amazing. Haha! Yeah, that's Christian there, lifting up his arms. Yeah, he was trying to kill us just a couple hours ago and now we're just hanging out. It's amazing. Can you tell us anything? Can you tell us, like, the details or anything? Honestly, I don't remember much, other than I was doing the ritual for the second time, and then I was just waking up on the floor, right over there. That's crazy. I do remember one thing. When... right before it left me, it said something. What? What'd it say? It said, "Just keep filming." What?! Do you know what this means? Yeah. It was trying to help us! Hey, Cole. Can I talk to you for a second? Yeah, sure. Do you want to follow me, or... Yeah, maybe in the bathroom? That's kinda weird. I don't know, I just want it to be quiet. Okay. Can you tell us about what happened and... I mean, I don't really know what to say. I don't really know much of what happened. I don't really know any of the people who were here earlier, it just seems like we were all you said, possessed by something? Yeah, that's... yeah. I mean, I don't know, man. There's definitely some weird energy coming from that room over there, but... All I remember was just being out at the grocery store, and then I was here. Michael, can I talk to you for a second? I just wanna... I'm just kinda like getting everybody's testimony of what happened. How do you feel about all this? Well, I don't know man. That was some crazy shit. I mean, I don't know any of these people I just kinda ended up, like, just... possessed, I guess... like actually, feel like something was inside me and then I basically just... ended up here. I don't know, it was pretty weird but it's a trip, dude. Yeah. Who are you, anyway? I'm Joe. I live here. Oh. Yeah, I'm Scott's roommate. Do you mess with this? No, I mean. No, not at all. No, I'm a Christian, so... You know, I don't want this stuff going on in my house and... You know, they did it without telling me, so... All I know, that's like, we are all possessed. That's, like, all I know. I don't know where am I right now. Someone, like, should tell me, right now, I don't know. Crazy things going on. I don't know. Look, I deal with this stuff all the time, okay? What?! No, you don't! Yes, I do! Hand to God, man. Not your God! Hahahaha! But no, I deal with it all the time. It's not a big deal. It's just, they didn't know what they were doing, and that's why it was a big deal. You follow me? Wait, so you're gonna do this in the future? Oh yeah! Wait, what?! Yeah, I was talking to some of the guys here, actually. Like, Tim. I don't know if you met John over there. But yeah, they were talking about next weekend, maybe getting together, summoning a Goeta. WHAT?! Yeah, man. Cause this one didn't work, right? So we're gonna do it again, we're gonna do it the right way. You know, if you want in, just let me know. What? I'm not gonna play around with that stuff. Didn't you learn anything today? Like what? What?! Like what?! Like that forgiveness stuff. That was Jesus' thing. Oh my God, Joe. Come on, man! Forgiveness existed way before Jesus, okay? And besides, man, honestly I feel like I'm opening a door for you and you're just rejecting it. What? Hey, I never got possessed. Neither did I. It's knowledge, Joe. It's about understanding the craft. Look, I know this is hard because of the whole proper upbringing, but joining this doesn't require you to stop worshiping your God. You can just stand there. Think about it, I guess. Just remember, Scott and Lena, they truly, truly did not know what they were doing. Wait a minute. Lena! Lena. You decent? Okay. What's up, guys. What? Are you okay, I mean You guys okay? Yes, we're good. Can you tell us how you feel and stuff? Like, what you saw... I mean, it said "thank you" and um and I saw, like us on a screen. *LAUGHS* Like a TV screen? No, like a computer screen. Adam, are you there? Free me. How much gold do you have, Adam? Millions. Where? Free me. Adam, Free me Adam, I reject you. Whoa!
