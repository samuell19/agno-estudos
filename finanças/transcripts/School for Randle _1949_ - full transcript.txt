Oh, Betty Andrews! Come here a moment. Now, remember what I tell you. Yes, Miss Weston. Keep away from those boys. Yes, Miss Weston. I don't want any more trouble with you. No, Miss Weston. Getting worse all the time. All this quarreling between you girls and the boys on the other side. Well, it isn't our fault. Really, Miss Weston. The boys start it every time. They won't leave us alone! Never mind them. Keep away from them and they can't start any trouble, can they? No, Miss Weston. Go on, then. Parker! Sir? There's something I want to say to you, Parker, before you go away. Yes, Mr. Nichols. Stay away from the girls. I'm just about tired of having to sort out your squabbles. Now let's have no more of it. Yes, sir, but it isn't always our fault, you know. It's the girls who start most of the trouble. If you keep your distance, they can't start anything. Now is that quite clear? Yes sir. Very well. Remember it. You know what he wants? What? You've got to keep away from the girls. Hey, that's a nice looking ball those girls have got there. Seems a pity to waste it on a sissy game like net ball. Now that's just what I was thinking. I don't know about you chaps, but I'm just feeling like a bit of soccer practice. You know how that is? Yeah, yeah. Suppose Mr. Nichols thought this? After what he said about keeping away from the girls? Oh, he won't see us. Anyway, it's only for a couple of minutes. Just to get our own back on those females for speaking to the head master about us. Come on, chaps. Hey, hey! Well, you're a lot of blessed hooligans! If you come back here I'll shut down the lot of ya! I'll poke me eye in your finger. Don't think you're frightened of me, because I'm not! He who laughs last, laughs last, la-la-last. What's up, Betty? What'd you do? Oh, it's those boys, Mr. Randle. They've taken our ball and they won't give it back. Don't worry, I'll get your ball back. I'm sorry Betty, I didn't mean-- Oh, go away Ted Parker. You're nothing but a lot of hooligans, you and those dead end kids. And to think, they send me citizens abroad. Well it was only a bit of fun. A bit of fun, you call that? Why don't you break her blinkin' neck while you're at it? Why for two pennies, I'd-- You'd do what? I'd wring your neck. Well do it. I haven't got two pennies. Well I didn't know she'd cut her knee. Didn't know she'd cut her knee. You've got a queer idea of fun, I must say. Here, take that away and swallow it. Ha ha! Mind you, that is a nasty cut, isn't it? Come on. I've got a first aid kit in the boiler house. I'll fix it up for ya. Oh, thank you Mr. Randle. The young nannylog. Oh, I expect it was an accident. He didn't mean any harm, really. Tell ya, if those fellas come around here again, they'll give me the biggest beating they ever had in their lives, I promise you. Now come on. Ooh! Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, it isn't so bad after all, is it? Oh, that's lovely. You ought to have been a nurse, Flat. I mean, Mr. Randle. I heard you the first time. You were gonna call me Flatfoot, weren't ya? Oh, I never was. Of course you were. All the kids call me Flatfoot behind me back. Well, some of them do. Yeah, they all do. So do you, don't you? Hmm? Ah. Well, I'll put 'em in a flat compress. It'll keep the dirt out. What's your mother gonna say about this? I'll tell her I fell down. That'll be true, won't it? I suppose so. Won't she be angry? Oh, mummy and daddy are never angry with me. No? Well, hardly ever. Suppose I'm spoiled, really. I'm an only child, you know. Yeah. I know. Hold on. You'll be alright. I'd like you to meet my mummy and daddy one day. I'm always telling them about you. Why, how's that? Well, I tell them you're really one of the most famous characters in our school. Oh. You're really very nice when a person gets to know you properly, even if you do act like an old sourpuss sometimes. Oh, I do, do I? What do they say to that? Well, they say they'd like to meet you if you're a friend of mine. I don't see why your father and mother should be so interested in me. Oh, well-- Well, I think it'll be alright, now. It's a poor job, but it's the best I can do. And don't do it again. Mr. Randle? Uh huh? What do you think of Ted Parker? He's a smart young fella, that. Both at lessons and sport. Of course he ought to be good at sport, I'm training him. Training? What for? Well, for the swimming championship, of course. Oh, you ought to win it easily, the pair of you. Why are you so bothered by him? I thought you hated the sight of each other, the way you're always squabbling. Say, don't tell me you're falling for him, the way he treated you today. Don't be silly. Of course I'm not. Hmm. I think he's fallen for you, though. No. Anyway, I don't care if he is. Thanks ever so, I must be off. Mr. Randle? Hmm? You really think he's falling for me? Go on, hop it. You shouldn't be here anyway. Ooh! Very special subject for today's lesson. The education committee, in conjunction with the ministry of agriculture, has arranged a series of lectures about British farm life. These will be given by Professor Dumbbell, here. The professor has been traveling around the various schools, giving these very interesting lectures about farm life. And today, it's our privilege to listen to him. Now, professor, I shall leave you to your work. Thank you, madam. Now, young ladies. You will see that from the collection of animals and birds here, that these lectures are going to be of great interest to you. There, we have some specimen pigeons. Now, these pigeons have been selected from nine separate countries; in fact, they're they only ones of their kind in captivity. The ministry values them at 500 pounds each. There are ducks, guinea pigs. These animals have been around the world with me for demonstration purposes, so that I can prove their value to the farming industry. I will speak of these animals later. Now, here is a most ingenious model of the common cow. It has been made especially for education demonstrations. By the aid of these switches, I am enabled to illuminate any portion of the animal to which I might require. I'm sorry to interrupt you, professor, but before you start your lecture, the headmistress would like a few words with you. Very good, madam. Oh, Betty? Yes, Miss Weston? Will you take charge of the class for me until the professor returns? Very good, Miss Weston. Now, stop! Now, girls, behave yourselves, or there's going to be trouble! Oh, dry up! Oh, don't get all swell-headed now that you're left in charge. Now don't be a silly ass, you want to blow the thing up? What's going on in there? I think he's taking a beating. Sounds like it. Let us have a look at it. Get out of there. Cut again? There's enough up in there without you lacking about. I can go in if I want to. Will you do as you're told? Cut that noise! I have a headache enough. You should be better in your own school. Have a little more quietness, please. No, quite right, yes. And you take that sweet out of your mouth. And put your feet in. What? Where's Miss Weston? She's gone to see the headmistress and left me in charge. But these girls wont take any notice off me. By whom, but they'll take notice of me, I'll tell ya. Now shut up. That's right. And get on with your lesson. But we haven't any lesson to get on with. We're waiting for Professor Dumbbell. What bell? Dumbbell. He's come to give us a lecture on farming. And he's brought that thing with him. What the hell's that? Next year's derby winner? The professor says it's an electric cow for demonstration. You press those buttons and its innards light up. Well, never mind. And listen, you girls are not fit to be left on your own. I'll take this lecture until Dogsbody comes back. Why? Do you know anything about farming, Mr. Randle? Two things I know nothing at all about, and farming's both of them. Now leave it to me. Hey. Hello? No, you come here. Very well then. If a man say he won't come to Montgomery... then... cancel it. Exactly. Does it? So you've got to have the black cap at last, eh? There you are! Oh dear, oh dear. You should have been hanged long ago. There we are! Now smile, smile. Smile. More like a road ax, isn't it? Alright, now. You get the switchboard. Okay. Off we go. What do you want? What have you got? Don't be facetious. What did I say, then? You said "facetious." What does that mean? I don't know. I hope it isn't rude. Leave those seagulls alone. They're very vicious. I never touched 'em. Don't. I say! There's a few letters missing from this alphabet. Oh, never mind. We'll replace those. Right, right. And now, to blind these mugs with science. Please, switch on. You silly thing! That's the wrong switch. This is the one. Well, I don't have time. Better leave it to you. You understand. Yes. Yes, thank you. Call yourself a professor? Come on, come on! Hey, hey, hey! Put 'em back! Oh! They flew away! You know I couldn't help it. They flew away. You know what you've done? These seagulls cost about, well, they're six each! One is six? Yes. Well somebody's being robbed. Why? Those seagulls are pigeons, and there's another one flown away. That's three shillings gone again. And I don't care whether they are peagulls or sigeons. Strudels or pigid-- Don't argue with me, anyway. Oh, get over. What do you think you're doing? What did you do? Hey! Aaaahhh! Look at that! Oh, now that did it. No, no, no! This is going to hurt you more than it's going to hurt me. Oh! Ooh! I'll stab ya! Very well. Ladies and those you have brought with you. Now, a little lecture on the cow. The cow is used by farmers to eat grass. And a cow's husband is called a bull. To be able to distinguish a bull from a cow, offer it a handful of hay. If she comes for it, it's a cow. If he comes for it, run like hell, the very devil. Now, from the cow we get cowheels, cowslips, and cowcumbers. And sometimes we get snooged. Yes, and a teeny little bit of corned beef thrown in. Now, you will see, the cow is a very large animal, but not quite as large as a bigger one of the same size. The cow has a leg at each corner, and several other appendages that we need not go into at the moment. Operator, may we commence? Thank you. Well spoken. I've never heard such nonsense in me life. Thank you. Don't mention it. Now switch on your front end. Good heavens! It's a full bowel scent. Flatuillumination. Well, I don't want that! You don't, she does. Well, I don't blame her, either. Switch it out, please. Give me your A. A. Beautiful. Your A on the board, I want the front end. A! Hey, hey! You here! Now here, you notice we have the mouth. I beg your pardon. Inside the mouth, we have the tongue, as you will see. Ooh, he's gotten it! Ooh! What the devil are you playing at? For heaven's sake! I couldn't tell you what's the matter with it. What's the matter with it? Give me the piece of paper. Whoa there, whoa there, whoa! Shut up, come out of it! You'll mess anything up. All you have to do it put it down there, and lock it up like that. Listen, let's get to business. Now, it's about time we did. Are you ready? Right. You've let those blasted ducks out! I'll murder ya! You're wet! Oh, well, the ducks got out. Here! Get out! You're not vexed, are you? Ooh... Help! Shut up! One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine-- Ow! Ooh! Well! And that's that, then. Fancy you playing with ducks at your age? Playing with ducks? We will continue with the lesson. Now you're talking sense! Good. Now, give me the ribs. The ribs! Now, children, here we have-- The ribs! I wanted the ribs. The ribs? But you've got the ribs! You've given me everything but the ribs! Listen, what do you want? What do I want? Give me the giblets. Give me the cow, even! Give me anything! Oh, but the blinkin' lights on! Between molecular weights of the two salts. 170 parts by weight of silver nitrate, 74.5 parts by weight of potassium chloride. If either salt is present in the greater amount than is represented in this ratio, the excess will remain unaltered in solution, along with the potassium nitrate that has been formed. If the two salts are mixed in the ratio of their molecular weights, e.g., 1.7 grams silver nitrate and .745 grams potassium chloride, then on filtering and evaporating the filtrate, crystals of pure potassium nitrate will be obtained. Now that's where I'm going to close the chemistry lesson this morning. This afternoon at three o'clock, I'm bringing an international footballer to give you a talk on soccer tactics. Alright, that's enough. Parker. Sir? As this is your last term here and you're the senior prefect, I think it would be a good idea if you took the English literature lesson this morning. Oh, thank you very much, sir. If anybody wants me, I shall be in the headmaster's study. Very good, sir. What are you doing here? Well, I missed English yesterday, so I've got to come and take it with you. Oh. Have you cleaned your shoes this morning? No. No, what? No polish. Do you know anything about English literature? Oh, yes. Then what is the name of the greatest author in English history? Edgar Wally. Nonsense. The wise man to whom I referred was of course William Shakespeare. Oh, yeah. I suppose you've heard of Shakespeare. Oh yes, we've got a pub named after him 'round our way. How interesting. Me dad thinks so. Now, William Shakespeare was born at Stratford-on-Avon in the year 1554, on St. George's Day. George who? George nothing. I mean St. George. Oh, St. George. That's the fellow who invented insurance cards. That was Lloyd George, you halfwit. I refer to St. George, the Patron Saint of England. I suppose you know what a patron saint is? Oh yes, yes. A patron is a man who goes into a shop, and a saint is a shopkeeper who lets him have something off the ration. Nonsense. A patron saint is the mythical figure who represents a particular country. St. George represents England. Sometimes referred to as St. George, the Cappadocia. I suppose you've heard of the Cappadocia. No. I never followed those Scottish teams. Now, Shakespeare was educated at his local grammar school, and at the age of 18, he was a married man with a family. Ooh, he was a quick learner, wasn't he? He rapidly became one of the greatest poets and dramatists-- What? Poet. Ooh, I know one of his poems. Mary has a little pram, she also has a bear. I've often seen her little pram, but I've never seen the bear. Amongst Shakespeare's greatest plays are Hamlet, Henry V-- Ooh, and then there was that one, "A Lot of Bother Over Naught." I'm quite sure Shakespeare did not write a play with such a ridiculous title. I presume you mean "Much Ado About Nothing." Well it's the same thing. Other famous plays of Shakespeare's are Romeo and Juliet, and Richard III. Otherwise, Dirty Dick. He was also reputed to be a very intimate friend of Queen Elizabeth. Who wasn't? In fact, not long after leaving home a poor, unknown young man, Shakespeare became rich and famous, and the reason for this sudden gift of wealth was because-- He got a line up on the penny pool! Alright, you can go now. Come on, out of the way! Hot! Lovely, yes! Oh, it's work, eh? Look at it, eh? That's not work. That's just thinking about it. Look at the time! Lunch! Knock off, come on, let's get cracking. Come on, move over. Move up there. Who wants all the table? No, I want that meeting your arm. Well you would. Aye. Ooh! Tomato, eh? Thank you. Oh, chicken again. Eh? Chicken again? I'm sorry, really. I'm very sorry. Accidents will happen, quite alright. Well that relaxes me a bit. Hold that, too. Not supposed to have that on the table. Put that away. Oh, what the devil are you playing at? Alright, it's at the table. Have your manners. Never forget your manners at the table. I was almost off that. Look at this, crumbs all over the place. Fit for a pig. Give that to me. Give it to me. For heaven's sakes, here. There's enough there to feed a horse. And a little bit of sugar, if you don't mind. That's right, tie it up. Oh, thanks very much. Oh, it's so refreshing. Oh, Mr. Randle! What a mess. Yes, we've just had tea. Well? What do you want? Just a social call. Have a sweet. Thanks, I will. Had any more fights with Ted Parker have we? Oh, no. As a matter of fact, I went to the pictures with him last night. Oh, you did, huh? Swell of you. He's a grand lad, isn't he? Mr. Randle? Hmm? Would you keep a secret if I told you one? Of course I would. Swear? Not in front of you, you're a bit too young, yet. Well, last night-- Last what? Last night, Ted said he was in love with me. He asked me to elope with him and get married. You're not going to do that are you? Oh, no. I like Ted an awful lot, but I'm not as silly as that. I should say not. No. If I did run away, it would be for one reason only. What's that? To go on the stage. The stage? Don't be ridiculous. The stage. It isn't ridiculous. Lots of girls who are younger than me go on the stage. Oh, does your father and mother know anything about this? Yes, they say the same as you. They won't even consider the idea. I should say not. Now don't you start. I'm going on the stage, and nobody's going to stop me. I've got a chance to start this week if I like. You have? Yes. A friend of mine is in the chorus of Cuties and Capers, over the Theatre Royal in Northfolk this week. She said she's sure I can get in with them. Well, in the chorus, will it fit right with you? Well it's a start, isn't it? I've got to begin somewhere. You don't need to begin anywhere. It isn't fair to your parents. What are you doing in here, Betty Andrews? You know this place is out of bounds. I just came in to speak to Mr. Randle. Now get back into class immediately. And never let me find you here again. Do you understand? Yes, Miss Weston. You should have more sense than to allow that girl in here, Randle. It isn't the first time I've caught Betty Andrews visiting here, and the next time it happens I shall consider it my duty to go to the headmistress. Oh, you will, will you? Certainly. Very well, then. Would you care for a suck of my toffee? Don't be ridiculous. Well alright. Sorry. I really don't know what you're thinking about. A man in your position. I'm disgusted with you. You know, this is getting blasted monotonous. Oh, Mr. Nichols, can you spare a moment? Yes, what is it? Well, I'm rather worried about something and I wondered if you could help me. Well certainly I will. What's the matter? A few moments ago I happened to go past the boiler house. And inside I find Betty Andrews, one of my girls, talking to Randle. Now you know it's absolutely forbidden for any pupil to go anywhere near the boiler house. Yes, but for youngsters, that's generally an invitation to go and do it. I spend half my life chasing my boys out of that place. Well, it isn't so bad for boys. But it's rather different for girls. Betty Andrews is unusually friendly with that fellow, Randle. It hardly seems right. I mean, a girl of her age and a middle aged man? No, I suppose not. When I spoke to him about it he nearly ignored me, so I thought you might help me. Me? How? Will you speak to him and impress upon him that he mustn't allow Betty Andrews or any other girl anywhere near the boiler house? Somehow it seems so much easier for a man to tell him. Alright, dear. I'll go and do it now. Thank you. There, that's mine, Mr. Nichols. Betty Andrews, isn't it? Where did you get it? Well if you must know, she dropped it out of her handbag, and I picked it up. And you kept it? Why? 'Cause I wanted to, that's all. Any business of yours? Yes, I think it is, Randle. This picture makes it very much easier to explain why I've come down to see you. It's about Betty Andrews. Well what about her? You've got to stop her coming down to this place, Randle. After all, it's... She does come down here fairly frequently, doesn't she? Suppose she does. Why? Now what do you think? We're just friends, that's all. She comes and talks to me. Well, you know these visits of hers, they're hardly the thing, are they? I mean, a girl like Betty, and a man like you? I don't know what you're getting at, Mr. Nichols. I think you do, Randle. I think you do. I'm quite prepared to believe that she only comes down here to talk to you, but it doesn't seem right. Why not? Well, do you think her parents would like it if they found out? Wouldn't like them to. Yeah, well, the best way to prevent that is to stop her coming down here, isn't it? Suppose you're right. Well, can I rely on that? Yeah. Good. Well, that's that. Excuse me. Could I have the photograph? But remember, she doesn't come down here anymore. That's a promise. Where the hell have you fellas been? Don't smoke when you're supposed to be working! Haven't you more sense? Come on, let's get things cracking. Put some coke in this barrow! Coke? Coke? Give me a shovel, will you? Here we are. A shovel. Here, hold that. Hello! This is no good to me! Why? It's bent! It's bent? Oh! Ha! There's something wrong here! There's something wrong! Get cracking! Come on! Yes, but there's something-- That'll do, that'll do. That's enough! Ugh. Open the door. Open the door! It's open! What's the matter with you? Oh! Did it on you that time! Are you going to jail, are you? Hello? Hello, love! You sound very happy. What's to do? What are you singing? All Through The Night. Well don't make it all through the day. I thought you were standing on a nail. I say, Belladonna, what plaster are you mixing up for lunch today? I'm making dinner for the school canteen, of course. Oh, what is for dinner? I was going to make a rabbit pie, but I haven't got any rabbit. Well, you don't need rabbit for rabbit pie. Don't be silly! If you made a cabinet pudding, you wouldn't expect the prime minister in it. What are you two doing here, anyway? Well, we've called in to see you, love. Now you've seen me. Hop it. Oh, Belladonna. Belladonna. Don't talk like that to me, sweetheart. You know I love you more than anything in the world. Darling, kiss me, love. Kiss me, and forget about him. I'm madly in love with you! If you think I'm crazy, I'm not. I'm stone raving mad about you. That beautiful mouth. That beautiful mouth, I love everything that goes in it. And your eyes! Your eyes, darling, are like the windows, the windows on the soul. What kind of a soul? Ah, lemon soul. Oh, Belladonna, dearest! Darling, darling, we're mad about you. You're crazy! Leave me alone! Stop it! Oh, dear, now I haven't got any lard. I'll have to go and get some. Now don't you two pinch anything while I'm away. She's gone. Have a mind. Red roses for a blue lady. Ah, she loves me, she loves me not. She loves me-- Well what about me? I'm left out in the cold. Never mind, boy, never mind that. But old pals, we'll still stick together. Up lads, and at 'em! En garde! Look boys, the rabbits have arrived! Ooh! Now let me make the pies. No, we'll show you how to make rabbit pies. Sure, it's our business! But I say, aren't you going to skin them first? Of course not! Skin them? Let the poor things catch their death of cold? Don't be childish. Yup, rabbit pie, there we are. Good old rabbit. Very well. On my left, Joe Louis. On my right, Woodcock. Fight! Best out of three! Go! Take some more flour, there we are. Let's have all the flour, don't want to miss a spot. Boys, for heaven's sake, let me do it! Oh, now, we'll make the pie, come on! If you're not careful, I'll bone you in as well! Yes! Ooh, and wouldn't she taste lovely? She wouldn't half. But we would take us a couple of legs. Oh, for heaven's sake, you're messing the whole thing up. We're only trying to help. Well alright. You two can make the soup. Soup! Soup? Soup! Where is it? Over on the stove, in the big pot. And if there isn't enough, there's plenty of water in the tap. Good. Where's the soup? It's a bit of soup, I think. Ah. It's not been eaten. Smells good. What does it taste like? Not bad. I think it's got scruff, got scruff. Ah, so it is, there's the bagpipe. Oh! Ooh, look! Ooh, I've got a bite! Look, a shark! Ooh, switch with me! Is it alive? Ah! A message, a message. Aha! Yeah, no, no message in there, no message in there at all. Ooh! Would you believe it? Brian! Yes! It's done, it's done! Get some soup made, quick! Otherwise the soup'll be ruined! Right! What a mess! They'll never be the same again. Well, can't you get them mended? What do you think they are? Loaves of biscuits? What do you two think you're doing? Look! Look at my crockery! Look at the fate of my kitchen! Before you came in here, everything was harmony! Look at it now! What do you think you're doing, eh? I've started to cook dinner about an hour ago! What happened? You two messed it up! Everybody's waiting for food! There's nothing done! The headmaster, the children, everybody will be starving! All because of you two! If you don't get out of my kitchen, I'll-- Don't you ever come into my kitchen! Cigarette? Not just now, thank you. Enjoying the ride, Betty? You bet I am. Now let's be serious for a moment. I don't have to be. You do that for both of us. I know it seems a bit silly, talking about getting married at our age, but we shan't always be this age. Thank goodness. It's almost funny being our age. Too many people bossing us around. Teachers and parents. Yes, but in another couple of years, we could start planning it seriously. Won't you promise to wait for me 'till then? I'm sorry, Ted, but I'm not promising anything about the future. Certainly nothing about getting married. There's only one ambition in my life. The perishing stage, I suppose. Yes, that's it. I'm determined to go on the stage, and nobody's going to stop me. Oh, don't be so silly. You know perfectly well your parents will never consent. I know they won't. Maybe I shall stop asking them. What are you getting at? Well, I shall ask them just once more, and if they say no, I'll-- Yes, you'll what? Never mind. What are you doing tonight, Betty? How about coming to the pictures? Well, I can't. I'm going to the music hall with Phyllis and Pat. I believe there's a good bill on this week. Well, can't you go another night? No, of course I can't. I promised. Come on, we'd better get going. I'm going to be late for tea. Alright. Oh! Ted Parker, how dare you do that? The stage? Oh, that's a theatrical paper, isn't it? Yes. I used to be in the business, once. Oh, what were you, the face at the window? No, it's alright, you laughing. I was pretty good, I tell ya. Even with that good old stage play, the girl who took the wrong turning? Yes? Well I'm the chap who took her off it. You were? And believe me, you've been a nasty old man ever since. I played Hamlet once. Who with? You're too damned inquisitive, that's the trouble with you. You played Hamlet? Yes, and I was pretty good, I'll tell ya. You, Hamlet? Laurence Olivier had naught on me. On the stage? On the stage. You did? Yes. I'd like to hear this. To be or not to be, that is the question. Oh, alright. If you're going to laugh, I won't do it! That's what you call Shakespeare? I call that Shakespeare. But I'm not doing it if you're taking the nice out of it. Oh, no, no, no, do! Please do it for us. I will not. Oh, do! Do Hamlet for us, please. Very well, then. Alright, I'll do it properly, and don't laugh this time, will ya? You'll see Hamlet played as you've never seen it played before. Carry on, carry on. Thank you. Right. Whether it is nobler in the mind, to suffer the slings of a great fortune-- Now, did Olivier do that? He didn't. He didn't play it the way I do. I should think not. To die, to sleep, and thus sleeping, end this heartache. Heartburn? Ooh, I get it. Something shocking. It catches me right here. That's a funny thing. Every time I have heartburn it gives me potato pie. No, you mean every time you have potato pie, it gives you heartburn. I said every time I've had potatoes, it gives me-- Shut up, you're pulling me off! Pulling you off? You were never on. Quiet! To die, to sleep, perchance to dream. Aye, there's the rub. Who knows in that sleep of death what dreams may come before we shuffle off this mortal coil-- Well don't lie on your back, then you won't have dreams. Thanks very much. The poor man's contumely... What the hell does contumely mean? Well, I don't know. I think it's French. Like au revoir and bonsoir and skin off your nose. Yeah, cheerio. Good health. Softly now, oh fair Ophelia. Aye aye. Aye aye? Aye aye, ha ha! I've been waiting for her coming in! Fair nymph, by all thy orisons be my sins remembered! Such talk! Remember I'm not that kind of a girl. Get thee to a monkery. Go! See, real fur. I've some more on this side as well. How dare you talk to a young woman like that? Me! Me, who has been so true to you! All the time, the yanks were over here. About! He's off again. This is the witching hour of midnight, when the cat got your tongue, the graves turn and yield their dead. Lead on the ghosts! Lead on, boys! Lead on, get cracking! Still breathing? Lead on! And one for he's not! Shakespeare. He couldn't play dominoes. Hamlet! Hamlet! I am thy father, giblets! Well anyway, I didn't think much of it. Well I still think it was a good show, and I don't care what you say, Betty. Well some of it was alright, but that singer was terrible. I suppose you could do much better, couldn't you? Yes, I could, if I had the chance. Well never mind, kid, you aren't likely to get the chance. Is that so? Well I know where I could get a job on the stage tomorrow if I liked. I bet you could. Where? Oh, never mind arguing. Just look at the time! Ten past eleven! Gosh, is it? Oh, I must fly! Come along Pat. Good night, Betty. Good night. Good night. That'll be Betty now, dear. Don't be too harsh with her. Hello, folks. Hello darling. You're late and you haven't done your homework yet. Oh, blow my homework. Now don't talk like that, Betty. Where have you been all this time? But daddy I told you. I've been to the Palace with Pat and Phyllis. It was a lovely night, so we walked home. The Palace. How I might have known. Can't you ever get your mind off the stage? But I don't want to get my mind off it. Oh, daddy, won't you let me-- Don't start that again, Betty. I thought we'd settled this preposterous idea, once and for all. Oh, what's preposterous about it? Don't other girls go on the stage? I don't care what other girls do. All I know is that you're not going. But daddy, why? Good heavens, I've told you over and over again. Your mother and I don't want you to go on the stage. Doesn't matter what I want, I suppose. Betty, you're too young to know your own mind, yet. This play idea is just a passing fad. You'll get over it. It's not a passing fad. If it were, I wouldn't have taken all that trouble with my singing and dancing lessons. My ambition is to go on the stage. Well you're not going, and the sooner you realize it, the better it will be for all of us. I am going on the stage, and nobody's going to stop me! I don't know what's come over her. Don't talk to me like that, Betty. I think the best thing you can do is to go upstairs to bed. I'll have no more of these silly arguments. You are not going on the stage, and there's an end of it. Goodnight, mummy. Goodnight, darling. Run along. I'll come and tuck you in. Goodnight, Betty. Goodnight, daddy. Betty seems set on this stage idea. Well heaven knows we've done everything we could to discourage her. Maybe it's in the girl's blood. Some urge that is greater than our discouragement. What do you mean? One of the drawbacks of adopting a child. They may have hereditary ideas that are stronger than a foster parent wishes. Well you better go up and see her, my dear. Alright, George. Single to Northfolk, please. Dear mum and dad, when you read this, I shall have gone away. Please don't be angry, but I think I've got the chance of a job on the stage, and if it comes off, I know I'll be a star one day, and you'll be proud of me. What made her take this drastic step? My husband was angry with her last night for coming home late. She adopted an attitude of a child. I see. We found the letter on her dressing table this morning. With this stage business she mentions, have you any idea where she might have gone to? I've not the slightest. That's why I telephoned, asking you to call. I thought you might be able to help us trace her. When I got your message, I went to Miss Hodge. And she suggested we both come out here at once. As headmistress of the school, I'm naturally anxious to do everything in my power to help you, Mr. Andrews. Our first idea, of course, was to go straight to the police and ask them to help us, but we wanted to avoid any scandal. We'd rather keep the police out of it. Yes, yes, of course. Couldn't you make inquiries around the school, to find out if any of Betty's friends know where she might have gone? Yes, that's a good idea. We'll do that. Although at the moment, I don't think we need tell anybody the true facts. We might say that Betty's away from school with a slight illness. Yes. And in the meantime, don't worry too much, Mrs. Andrews. We'll do everything in our power to find Betty and bring her safely home. I hope so. She's so young, running off like this, and I've no idea where. Well, I think we'd better get back to the school, now. Oh, Mr. Andrews, don't forget the Old Boys' Association is holding its meeting tonight, and you're in the chair. I'll be there. My husband will run you along in the car. Oh yes, of course. Goodbye Mrs. Andrews. Goodbye. Professor, they haven't forgotten that yet. Oh, don't you worry about me. As long as Mr. Nichols is still there, I'm alright. Now then, where have they got to? What? Me glasses. They were here about five minutes ago. I was using them. Have you seen my glasses? Yes, many times. I mean now. No. Ohh. Where are they, for heaven's sake? Mind, be careful! I've chopped all that up. Well get some. There isn't any. Well get some from somewhere. Don't worry me. I don't think I'll take 'em. Yes, anything you like. They must be here. Oh, Lord. Come in! Hi-ya, Bella! Well, there's the key. It's alright? Fires are fine. Now take your hats off in me edifice. Oh, sorry. Oh, put 'em back on. Well, come on. Yes, we'll go now. Where you off? Where do you think? One or two? Yes, we got a horse and jockey coming. I'll pull it down later. Good. Will I line them up for you? Yes, and tell them I want my froth at the bottom. So long, Bella. See you later. Well I can't understand where they've gone to. Listen, I ask you, you haven't seen my specs anywhere? No! Oh, come out of it. My pen's gone now. I couldn't find nothing at all. I don't have your glasses. I don't need them. I can see-- Goodness gracious! What's happened here? What's all this about? I did it. You did it? That's what you told me to do. You said I could chop it up. I don't have any wood-- Chop the chair? What are you talking about? Come here, you! Come here! I'll show you some chopping! Flatfoot! Leave him alone! Now just a minute! But he's only a boy! Aahh! Now get along! Stop it! Serves you jolly well right! He's a sweet little boy and it's not fair. You'll frighten the poor little thing to death. Besides, he was only trying to help you. Help me? He'll smash the place to pieces. Don't be silly. We'd all like to come and help you. Thanks very much. I appreciate it. I wish Mrs. Jackson was back, though. You mean the cleaner from the school? Oh, what a wonderful woman. Oh, keeps the place like new. Makes the beds, empties all the oil from the lamps, puts fresh wick in, oh, she does all sorts for me. Flatfoot, I'd do anything for you. What? You know, you wouldn't be bad looking if you had another face. Thank you. Hey? You've got something. You think so? Flatfoot, have you never thought of taking another wife? I did once, but her husband nearly flattened me. Have you never felt the need of a woman's arms around you? Oh, get away. Flatfoot, wouldn't you-- No, I wouldn't. Wouldn't you like to kiss me? I wish I could find my glasses. Now what's happening? What is it? What did I tell ya? I'm going down to the village. I'll finish your ironing when I come back. No! Hey! No, no, hey! I found it! Get it out of here! No, no! I found it! Found it before he was lost. No, I found it! He already was lost! Get it out! He don't know where to go! I know where he's gonna go! Will you get it out! No, I'm gonna keep it because I pet it. Oh, pet me down. Oh, go on. Will you get it out? I've got a name for it. So have I. I'm gonna call it Me Happy Breeze. Me Happy Breeze? It's a thoroughbred, you know? It looks old to be-- Will you take the blasted thing out? Ooh, I bet he can run. Run? The thing can hardly stand up. Oh, go on, let's keep him, eh? Oh, stick it in my bedroom, would you like? Ooh! What about the smell? He'll have to put up with that. Alright. Will you get it out before I strangle you? Aww. Get the thing out! You'll get me in for him. Take it away. Go on! Get out of here! Get off it! Don't bring an elephant next time. Oh my lord, heavens. While I'm down to the village. Is there anything I can get for you? Yes, get me some crusty cabbage. And some fresh lettuce. What? Never mind. Come in. I've got this now. Oh, no. Ooh, yes. Oh, get it out of here! What do you keep bringing things in like that for? I paid sixpence for it. Wasted money like that? Where did you get your sixpence from? I found it. Where? In that pot up there. That's my money box. He's got a pedigree. Has he? Well keep it away from the table. Out of Ophelia by braces. I don't care if it's held and conditioned by harpy. Will you take it away. Oh, listen my son, don't. Couldn't you have gotten a little blue bottle or something like that? I'll go and get one. He'll go and get one. Get out of here! Oh, you won't let me have anything. You won't let me have a pony, you won't let me have a dog, you won't let me have a blue bottle, you won't let me have anything at all. I know what you can have! Oh! Here, doggie! Come here! Sit. Ooh! That's the thing. Ponies, dogs, blue bottles. See? A blue bottle. Thank you. Oh, I oughtta! I'll show you some chopping! Ah, here's the headmistress now. Oh, Miss Hodge, we've been talking about Betty Andrews. Have you found anything out yet? She talked about going on the stage, but nobody knows anything definite. It's been almost a week now since she left home. Unless we've discovered something by tonight, I really think we should tell the Andrews to tell the police. I do so hate the bad publicity, both for them, and for the school. But there may be no alternative. Have you talked to everybody who knew anything about it? Well, I thought we had, but Miss Weston has just remembered somebody else. Who's that? Randle the caretaker. Well what will he know? Well it's nearly a wild guess that he knows anything at all. But you remember how very friendly he always was with Betty Andrews? You mean she may have confided something in him? Well, it's a possibility worth following up. I was wondering if you'd like to talk to Mr. Randle, Mr. Nichols? Yes, of course I will. May I have that letter? Oh, but Randle's out on road work with the boys at the moment. Oh, never mind. I'll speak to him when he comes back. Yes, do. Thank you. Parker! Sir? You have a good exercise? Yes sir, thank you very much. How's he shaping? Oh well, sir, you see they're both in the pink of condition. I thought Randle was with you? Well he was sir, but he gave up. Why? He told me he was a good runner. Aye, he was, but he's worn his feet out. Yes, I think he's walking on his knees now. Where is he? I think he's cooling off in the boiler house. You cut off and take a shower. You two come with me. Get up. Mmm-mmm. Well that silly little fool. I thought she'd been ill all the week. Well, the headmistress put that story around so that the real facts wouldn't come out. We were wondering if Betty told anything to you that she didn't confide in anyone else. Exactly where she went for this stage job? Why should she tell me? Now listen, Randle, you and Betty were good friends, weren't you? I suppose so. Well didn't she ever say anything to you about her stage ambitions? Yes, she did. I tried to talk her out of them, though, but it seems I was wasting me time. Now listen, we do know that she left home to go on the stage. Didn't she ever say anything to you that might suggest exactly where she went? She did, yes. It was only last week she told me she had a chance to jump in a stage show. I'll bet a pound that's where she went. Now where was it? I'll tell her father to go and get her right away. Her father? Well certainly he's the one to look after this affair now, isn't he? I don't know. No, no, leave it to me, will you? It's better than her father. Yes, but what shall I tell Andrews? Just say that a certain party is insistent on doing things in his own way, and he seems to know where Betty's gone. I suppose you know what you're doing. I think so. If Betty's gone where I think she's gone, I'll have her safe at home by tomorrow. You wait and see. Very well, I will. But I hope you're right. Ooh, you know, this coke smells just like gas. Well don't talk too much. Oh, we'll have to keep the cat off this coke. Yes, I think we'd better get rid of it. Get some rats in for a change. That's it. This week, Cuties and Capers. Theatre Royal, Littlefield. Hey, come here! What's wrong? We're going on a trip. Where to? Littlefield. Littlefield? Littlefield. Littlefield? Don't keep saying Littlefield. We're going to the Theatre Royal, Littlefield. 100 miles to see a show? There's a theatre right in the town. We're going to the Theatre Royal, Littlefield. Now come on. Come on. Everything happens to me. Excuse me, does your bus go to Littlefield? No, we're going to Aberystwyth. What with? Aberystwyth. Oh, I thought he was going to say, I know a little nursery rhyme about Aberystwyth. Oh? Yes. There was a young woman and chap from Aberystwyth-- Aha, no! That isn't the one. Oh. Here, well what's it got Littlefield on the front for? Because they can't spell Aberystwyth. Now, don't be silly, messing about, you aren't going to Littlefield? They aren't going to Littlefield. We are going to Aberystwyth. They are going to Aberlittleswyth. Little Aberfeeashishwinafee. I'll tell you what we'll do, we'll all go to Littlefield. Yes. Right. Listen, how do you know we'll get there? Look what happened last night. 47 people killed on the bus. 48. 48? 48. Not 47? I'm walking in. Oh, now you don't. No, no, no. Oh, I thought that was me breakfast come up. This is no time to masticate your food, man. Well listen, I'm going on top. You can't. This isn't going there. Oh go on, get inside. Get off my foot! Thank you. Apres vous. Thank you. No, you missed the hole. Excuse me, I'll show you. Like that, you see. Come on, don't mess about. Come on! Thank you. I say, boys! Cuties and Capers! Oh, come on. It says so there! Never mind. Listen, good on the capers and keep away from these cuties, understand? So this is the joint? Don't call this dump a joint. Now, how about this doorman? What about the doorman? Well, he'll have to be tipped, you know? Don't look at me! Of course, you've got to-- I'm skinned. What about you? I haven't got any money. Look again, look again. I've only half a dollar. Oh, that reminds me, you owe me five shillings. Half a crown. You still owe me half a crown. Here, you owe me five shillings. You still owe me half a crown. That's funny, you owe me five for laundry, remember? Well, I still owe you half a crown. That's right. You owe me half a crown, now we're quick. Yes, and you owe me half a crown, now we're quick. Now we're all quick, we're alright. Well come on then. Ah, wait a minute! How about my half dollar? Oh, we can't be bothered, we've got no time for that. I've twisted meself. Hey! Where do you think you're going? We're going to see a girl. Oh no you're not. Oh yes we are. But I say you're not. Well I say-- Ooh, he says we're not? I say we are. Yes we are! Hey, hey, hey, hey, aaaahhh! What are you playing at? There's no admittance except on business. Oh, but we are on business. Of course we are. What business? He's come to see one of the girls. That's right. I'm surprised at you, a man of your age. What do you mean, a man of my age? Chasing chorus girls, and you, old enough to be their father. Look at you. What? Look at you. Have you seen him? I tell you I haven't come chasing chorus girls. Of course you have! Go on, get out of here or I'll give you the charge. I'm asking you civilly enough, can I see one of the ladies in the show? I know you are. I know what for. Gotcha. Well, he's humble. Does he think I? Yes. I'll knock his block off. I say I'd, yeah. Hold my coat. Come on, don't be silly, don't be silly, come on. Oh, it's a good job he didn't let go. Yes, with a temper like yours. He'd have flattened me. Yes he would. Ooh, I've got an idea. What is it? Come on. Right. Our business is I'll smack ya. Well? Well. Yes. The idea. Oh, the idea. Yes. What was it? I've just forgotten. Do you know? I wasn't looking. I'll tell you what I thought. If we-- No, we've got to get in. Yes. Supposing I-- No. I'd like to walk about there meself-- Oh, we'll never get around that side, it's impossible. Too small. Now then, perhaps if a-- No, I don't think so. What utter frailty. Yes, yes. If we could-- Oh, no, no. Too small. He'll get us all pinched. Couldn't? No. What the devil are you talking about? I don't know. We've got to get in to see Betty. That's what we came for. Of course. Ooh, look! The window's open! It's the dressing room. So it is. Ooh, the idea! I've remembered. Wait there. He's got us all framed. Get a hold of something, quick. Oh boy oh boy! Thank you very much. Come on. I'm afraid not. He's on the stage at the moment. I don't know. You'll have to phone up again. Yes, alright. You'll want him to pull up on it as soon as possible. Okay. It's all clear, come on. Who are you then? How do you do-ski? We are Russian-ski. We sing-ski, we dance-ski! We sing and dance. You've a bit of a play here? Ya. Good. No? Yes. No. I come from Vladivostok. Where's that? It's a long way from Shepherd's Bush, I'll tell you that. Ya, there's some dance here? Ya, my man is good. Watch. Very good, watch. What a couple of twits. Go on, scram. Good-ski? No good-ski. Bad-ski. I don't think-ski. No-ski. We'll try something else. Oh, ya. Well, you made a nice mess of that, didn't you? I think you tweaked it. Yes. Aye, listen. We'll have to get in there to find Betty some way. Yes. Oh! I've got another idea! No kidding. Yes! Wait a minute. Hello, he catches his head. Take those. Here you are then, that. Yes, speaking. Who's that? Mazu? What? Your coach is broken down and you can't get back? Can't you get a plane? Lunatics, eh? Where do you think I'm going to get another act from at this time of night? Oh, alright. What am I gonna do now? Nobody in there please. No please.

Look that way, please. Thank you please. Three, two, gone. Where has he gone? Don't tell me, please. Look that way please, thank you. Turn around, please. See? Only two, but-- That's very good! We're wasting your time. Come to my office and talk it out. I say girls, you're wanted in the wardrobe. I'll come along in a minute. Excuse please. Ah, there you are. What? It's alright, it's only me. Mr. Randle, what on earth are you doing here? What do you think I'm doing here? I followed you. How did you know where I was? How did I know? I don't read Shakespeare and Blake for nothing. I saw the note that you left at home. Mr. Nichols showed it to me. I assumed that's where you've gone. Why would he show it to you? Because he thought I might have an idea where you've hopped it to. Well, now that you are here, Mr. Randle, what do expect to do? I want to try to get some sense into you, and take you back home again. You're wasting your time. I'm in this show and I'm going to stay in it. Listen, Betty. You're far too young to come out on your own like this. Oh, don't be silly. I'm nearly 18. Ah, well. Listen Betty. You know, this isn't fair to your parents. They've done everything for you, and tried to give you a fine education, bring you up as nicely as possible, grand home, and you let them down like this. You're letting the school down as well. And Ted Parker. In what way? Well, you remember the Challenge Cup against Claremont, don't you? You and Ted are supposed to be swimming against them. Oh, you remember all the fun we had in the last practice? All the kiddies? Well if you don't lead Claremont after this, I'll sign the plank. You remember. I was so certain you were going to win against Claremont. We had fun, didn't we? Listen, Betty, come home, won't you? Oh, I don't know. Come in. I come in yes now please? Yes? You busy? Oh no? Oh, Hu Flung-- Shh! Hu Flung nothing. I come to show you both trick, very good trick. Cigarette, look, you, good. Good, yes, trick? Well you big duck. Mr. Randle, what's all this about anyway? Where did you get these clothes? Oh, well it's-- Good heavens! My legs have gone numb! Oh, I beg your pardon. Well, it's a long story. I'll tell you all about it later. Now listen-- Good heavens! Somebody looks like a horse in me face. Shh. If you please, you come, manager wait for you. Well, you're coming back, aren't you? You come please, quick, come. Bye bye. Ladies and gentlemen, I have to apologize that owing to circumstances beyond our control, the illusionist Mazu is unable to appear tonight. Fortunately and at great expense, I have engaged a substitute. An act only arrived in this country this morning from China. Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you the Three Hu Flungs. Too Low. Too Low? Too Low. Do trick? Hung Low? Hung Low, yes, here, please. Oh, please. Trick one. Thank you. Hold. Thank you. No, no, no, no, please. Like this. Oh, it's good. Very good trick. Yes please.

No can do eight times, bring back three. Ooh, goodness gracious. No, I tell you what I do, I disappear myself. And no come back. But you good night. Thank you please. Come on, Betty-- What have you changed for, we're on in a minute. I decided to go back home. Don't be silly. Stick it out. We'll get our chance soon. It doesn't matter now. Well you can't walk out of the show. You'll manage all right without me. You're not coming then? No. I've made up my mind. There's your cue. Goodbye, Betty. Goodbye, Joan. I'll write to you. Just a minute. I don't know what to say to them. Come on, don't be a silly little dullard. Come on, let's go. Well, here we are, home again. I'm almost afraid to go in. Oh, shut up. There's nothing to be afraid of, they'll be too glad to see you back. And tomorrow, back to school I suppose. Well, it won't be for long. It'll soon be the end of term. Mr. Randle, you've got to come in with me. No, not me. No thanks. Oh, but you must. No, I can't. I'm not anyway, and I want you to promise me one thing. Promise you what? Don't tell your father and mother I brought you home. But why shouldn't I tell them? Because I don't want you to. I don't want you to say anything about me at all. Look. Oh, it's mummy. Now you'll have to meet them. Not likely. I'm off. Bye bye. Mummy. Betty. Oh, Betty! Oh, I thought you'd come back tonight, my darling. Oh, however could you do such a thing to us. I'm terribly sorry, mummy, I know I've been beastly and selfish, but please forgive me. Of course I will, dear. As long as you're home again, nothing else matters. Come along. Let's go and tell your daddy the good news. Is daddy very angry with me? No, no, of course not, dear. He'll be only too thankful that you're back. Hello, Betty. Hello, Mr. Randle. I thought I'd come and see you. Good. By the way, how did it go on last night? Were they angry with you? Oh, no. It was just like you said. They were only too glad to have me home again. What did I tell you? And now I've got you, Mr. Randle. What do you mean? Well you can't get out of meeting them this time, because I've brought them here with me. Oh, you shouldn't have done a thing like that, Betty. But you can't keep on avoiding them. Even if you are shy. And anyway, they want to thank you themselves for what you did last night. Mummy, daddy? At last you're going to meet Mr. Randle. Delighted. Splendid. This is Mr. Randle you've heard so much about. Mr. Randle, I want you to meet my mother and father. Good heavens, it can't be. You of all people. Yeah, I'm afraid it is me. Do you know who it is? Of course. This is why you avoided meeting my husband and me. You knew we'd recognize you. What's the matter, daddy? Do you know Mr. Randle? I certainly do. But not by that name. You mean you don't know who he is, Betty? Of course I know who he is. It's Flatfoot. I mean, Mr. Randle, our school caretaker. Who else should he be? What am I to tell her? Only the truth, that's all. What do you mean, the truth? Betty, this man is your father. My father? But you're my father. No, Betty. We are only your adopted parents. He is your real father. But how can he be? Well, Betty, my love, it all happened about 17 years ago, when your dear mother died. Your father decided then that a baby like you needed more care than he could give you, needed a mother's care. We were looking for a baby to adopt at the time, and someone put us in touch with Mr. Randle, your father. Yes, and he agreed that we should take you and bring you up as our own. He realized that we could do so much more for you than ever he could. But you assured us that you'd never come back here any more. I know I promised. And I kept that promise 'till about three years ago. And I only came back just to see her, that's all. You'd no intention of making yourself known? Oh, no, it was only to see her once in a while. And I was so settled to find out what a lovely girl she'd developed into under your care. Oh, thank you. Oh, I used to hang about the school for days, watching her go to and from. I just wanted to be close, and one day, I discovered something. What was that? They were advertising for a caretaker for school. I applied for the job. Why? Well, so I could be near to her most part of the time, and knowing who I was, of course. And since then, we've strangely enough become very good friends, haven't we, Betty? Yes. You made much better parents than ever I could hope to. And I didn't want you to know I'd come back of course, that's why I've avoided... coming to meet you, see? Well... Well, what are we going to do now? I don't know. Thought it would be better if we talked it over later. Oh very well. Come in. Oh, I'm sorry Mr. Randle. Am I intruding? No, it's alright, lad. Come in. I thought I'd come and have a chat with you about the final tonight. Oh, yes, by the way, you haven't met Mr. and Mrs. Andrews yet, have you? Oh, yes. Good afternoon. Betty and Ted are swimming in the final against Claremont. Yes, we've had an invitation from the headmistress. Oh, are you going? You bet we are. We must go and see our Betty win. Everybody out of the water. Now for the final of the freestyle competition between Lynhurst School and Claremont School. Betty Andrews and Ted Parker swim for Lynhurst. Angela Kelly and Tony Appleton represent Claremont. On your marks. There you are! I told you we'd win, didn't I? We? What do you mean, we? We. Me. I trained them. You trained them? I did. I trained more channel swimmers than you've had dinners. You've trained-- oh go on. Here, you're a nice fellow. Why'd you push him into the water? I didn't push him in. You did push him in. I saw you push him in. Please don't do that. I don't like it. But I could do that to you as much as I like. I said don't do that. Don't go away! Come here. I won't be a moment. Alright, Betty. Good morning, dad. Oh, hello Betty. What are you doing? Just ordering a few bulbs. Three shillings each way? They're special sort of bulbs, you see. Well how are you love, alright? I'm alright, dad. Well, have you decided anything? As a matter of fact, I have, yes. What? I think we'd better leave things as they are. You know, one day, you may have a home of your own. And then what? Suppose you'll fix me up as a gardener or something. You never know. I say, dad, I like those new teeth of yours. They're smashing. Smashing. If I could only keep them up I'd be alright. Who's this, dad? That's your mother. Isn't she lovely? You're the image there, aren't you? Oops, I hear the church bells. I must go, I should be late. Are you going to church? Yes, with Ted Parker. Where is he? You'll see him, dad. Well, I'd better see you to the door. Well. Goodbye dad. Cheerio, Mr. Randle. Mr. Randle? Flatfoot. That's better. I'm proud of her.
