Hello! Coffee or tea? - No, thank you, I'm waiting for somebody. Taxi? - No, thank you. As-salamu alaykum. - Wa alaykumu s-salam. Enough, don't cry, we have all been through this! Congratulations to you. Hi! Did you get the cola? Ali! - God Bless you! Have some tea! Give me the camera. - No, not now. You're driving me insane with this stupid game. In this game you get to choose weaponry, not like the other one where you only use a pistol. What's the name of the game? - Shop til you drop. What do you think? - I didn't sympathize with her. Me neither. No feelings... - Like a piece of wood. Snake! Hurry, film her now... Look! Isn't it better? I've had your sperm tested. Why? Why? I've been to two different doctors, there's nothing wrong with me. We've tried for three years now. Then the problem has to lie with you, right? No, that's not true. What kind of a test is that? What the hell, stop lying! My ex wife wanted me to... We had three kids already. Her body couldn't handle the pill, she was puking all the time, so she insisted that I should... Perhaps it was some kind of control issue... or she was just jealous. But I don't know... Then I met you. I just couldn't tell you. It wasn't part of your identity... Hey? Come on, we have so much else together. Well. But it's over now. Don't be so dramatic, if you really want kids we can revert it. And we can always adopt. It's also better for the environment. God... You're not even feeling bad about this. No. And here is your cola, sir! You shouldn't have bothered! Thank you. Government is the same everywhere, they never care about their citizens. Anyway, they are in negotiation with what's his name... Anderson. Is there any danger on us? No, don't be afraid, they are using a special phone outside the city border, no one will know where they are. Since when do we hit women? What? Is your heart getting soft? Anyway... If they don't pay soon with all these talks with the press and Anderson, we'll sell her to ISIS. - That's nonsense. I'm joking with you man! No seriously... Listen, the woman needs... Cotton. - Cotton? You mean nappies? She has tampons in the camera bag. Let her use a rag like women in the desert. But you said you would return all her stuff, right? Once we are done, I mean. I dream of you, Ingrid. Please forgive me. I tried, but it is not possible. Me and your sister. It would encourage terrorism, they said... Just please get me out of here... Hi. What's the matter with you? Moussa! Let go of her... Bashir! Get your stuff. - No, I don't want to stay here. Get your stuff! I can't handle your drama now! What's going on with you? What's happening? You think it's time for love and passion now? What are you talking about? They're bombing Gaza, do you know that? How would I know? - Of course you don't, you're in love. May God forgive us. Get your stuff, we're taking supplies to the tunnels. Now! Moussa, don't leave me here long. - Suck it up! When did they bomb? - Last night. Last night? Once we get phone reception, call your wife to make sure she's OK. What are you looking at? Snacks I ate... I need to charge the iPad, it ran out of battery! We are counting on you. What's going on? How good looking is the Blondie? - Beautiful. Party is over! Turn off the music! Why did you kill him? The tunnels that were hit a couple of days ago, this scumbag was the informant. How would you know? - I caught him red handed! Since when do we kill informants without a fair trial? Get her! You scumbag! Hi Anna. I hope you're doing fine. I know, that we haven't always got on well, but... you are the only family I have... And I love you. Whatever happens, please, don't pay. Please, I beg you. Don't pay. Go on with your life. And forgive me. Are you OK? Get up! Get up! Please take it. Thank you. Stay quiet so she can rest. I hope she will be OK. - In God's will.
