Marie. Marie. Are you ok? Tell me again. My driver will hear. Tell me in French. If we are ever separated, no war, no injury, no challenge will be enough, You see, I know that you are waiting for me. I will find you, and I will love you. Love is stronger than death. You believe so? Oh I know so. We will miss you. We? Promise to return to us soon. Take it slowly, the road is terrible and we're not in a hurry. I'm sorry. It's ok. Colonel Von Bruckner, there's something in the road. Wait here. No, no, no don't leave me. Don't shoot, I'm French! You're the German's whore. I'm innocent, I'm one of you. This is no joke. Look at this! No, please don't shoot. What should we do? Adieu. Thank God you're safe my love. I am so sorry you had to see that. Please come. We need to hurry. Please, please come on. Come Marie. Let's go. We're in danger here. I think that's someone's grave sir. American Soldiers. No need to be afraid. Go ahead and tell him we're on a very important mission. We're looking for the grave of a man called Von Bruckner. He said there's no Germans buried here sir. He said it's war. Yeah. Caught that. Somebody's bullshitting. Come mademoiselle. Walk straight ahead. All right you got it. Whoa peanut. Looks like you were rode hard and put up wet. Move Kraut-fucker. What's he saying? Does he have a fucking problem? He gets the point sir. Is this necessary? God damn right it's necessary. Corporal? All clear Top. Get him the fuck out of here. Go on get out of here. There's a shack. Vic. Go. Move it Frenchie. I don't trust it. Relax and have a seat. Make yourself comfortable. We might be here for a while. We've come too far to go home empty handed. That's for sure and I swear to you I will show no remorse whatsoever in leaving you in one of these open graves. Am I making myself clear Marie? That's good. Come on. I'm gonna help you up now. You ok? Tell us where Von Bruckner's grave is. I can't remember. You don't know? She don't... You're the one that told us there was fucking gold here Marie. I can't remember. What if I take her back behind those trees? Get some answers. Like you did with that Italian broad? Got the job done didn't it? She would have said anything. Man what's your problem! Huh? What is it to you? God damn it! We ain't no fucking Nazis! Am I right? You should fucking know that better than anyone! You know what, you're gonna talk. She's gonna talk to us. You wanna know why you're gonna talk to us. Because we are no longer enemies Marie. We're all allies now whether we like it or not. The sooner we find the grave, the sooner we can all go home. The cemetery's changed. So many more graves now. You have a general fucking idea maybe? Maybe this? Right here over the stream? Right here? Ok. Looks like we're digging. Let's find some shovels. You're with me. Shovels? It's a cemetery corporal. You just know they got shovels around here somewhere. They're doctor recommended. I've been party to some questionable stuff during this here war of ours but this here takes the biscuit. Your people were going to tar and feather that girl. She begged us to help her. Promised the Major buried treasure. He's risking a court marshal if we get caught. Here. Like I said we're allies now Marie. Come on. You need it. Just remember one thing. I find out you're fucking with me I will kill you deader than dirt. Thank you for the cigarette. See there you go. You do speak some English. So you are African? African? No sir. I'm from Harlem. New York City. New York. Greatest city in the world baby. Home of Nat King Cole. Ella Fitzgerald. Louie Armstrong. Louie Armstrong. West Town Blues. West Town Blues that's right. Sometimes during this here war I close my eyes and I swear I can hear that music playing in my head. You like them American cigarettes I see. Don't get paid enough for this shit. Let's have a look Marie. You ok corporal? No! There's a body but there's no gold. Well if you keep playing with us this will not end nicely for you. Come on. Right there? Next one boys. We keep digging. Let's go. Ah fuck. You have nothing to worry about. They're not gonna hurt you. Just keep your mouth shut and I'll make sure that you're safe And believe me when I say I've never seen assholes like these guys before. Major Maitland. He's good people. He just got lost somewhere along the way. But those other two assholes now I've followed along side them and I've seen them do things. Inexcusable things in the name of war. What we doing right here we just ain't got cause for. What's down there? Motherfucker don't make me hurt you. What's down there?! We're dead if they find him like this. We're dead if they find him like this. What? He was your new best buddy? Did you have to kill him?! Didn't have the time to think. He'd have kicked the shit out of me! She's here. Who? Your girlfriend. Your Belle Marie. She finally came back. So she survived? She's here because the gold is here! She must have brought the gold here three years ago. What the fuck are you doing? Improvising. If she's really here, then she needs our help. Instead of complaining, try helping me here! I think I have a plan! No gold Major. No gold. I thought that was it. It was long ago and so dark. Major, I can go back and get a metal detector from the engineers. And Frenchie is gonna say God damn it four guys digging up graves in their graveyard. Hell no. They're gonna call all their fucking buddies and be back here digging up every God damn grave before your detector ever gets here. I am worn God damn threadbare. You hear me? I'm trying to see it in my head like it was that night. She's a liar and a trickster Major. I don't believe there's any more gold in this here cemetery as in my dirty, rotten kit bag. I'm sure. We'll see. Shit. Yes sir. No sir. That's not funny. Look at this. These Americans are so big, what do they eat? Well, they eat actual food. That's a good start I guess. Here, clean yourself up. You stay here and cover me from the door. Take this. Lie down if the shooting starts. I hope you know what you're doing. No fucking way. There's no gold in here. God damn it! Major! You get it?! Taking us on a wild goose chase are you! Is that what you're doing?! Bitch! What the fuck's your boy doing? Why's he left his post? I don't know. Maybe he wants to trade out. I don't like it. Corporal, go see what's going on. Yes sir. Vic what're you doing? Stay down. Stay close. Cover me Major. How you doing buddy? Through and through. Give me a grenade. Hold your cover. No! No! No! Clear. Fucker just disappeared. Come on. You go first. Stay right here. All clear. What the fuck is this about? Look at me. Were they here waiting for us Marie? Were you setting us up for a fucking setup? I don't know. I'm not with them. We're under strict orders not to get involved with any reprisals but we made an exception for you. Help me she said. Help me and I'll show you where they hid the gold right? Help me and I'll make you God damn rich. Risk being court marshaled on your word. Do you know what that means? Badger holes all over the damn place. Badger? What the fuck is a badger? I'm gonna be ok right? I'm gonna be ok yeah? 100% copacetic brother. Fuck that redneck boy. You can't lie worth a shit. Top. Chris. Jerry, don't leave me here. You have my word. You have my word. Promise? I do. Hayseed. Bye old pal. What do we do with him? Makes no difference right now does it? Let's get to it. See that bloody mess lying in the hole right there? That's our Chris. We all landed in Sicily. Fought our way up through Southern France fighting for y'all. Chris, he killed a lot of Nazis. He was God damned good at it too. Wasn't the youngest man. Wasn't the smartest man either but well he was out with me. There he is lying in that God damned hole because of you. Not because of me. Because of your greed. You didn't kill Nazis for me or my people. You killed them because they were shooting at you and wearing a different uniform. You're no heroes. You're just survivors. The last man standing. Call it a day. Tired of her shit boss and I'm done listening to this bitch. Come on Jerry. Come on now. Give yourself a second and think about this. Two of our good men died digging for that God damned gold and one of hers died defending. I swear to you my brother there is gold here but hey you want to slit her throat and get us home nice and early then be my guest. Tie her up Jerry and then we'll go looking for that tunnel rat. Got a present for you my little French badger. God damn! You ok Jerry? All ok. That was bigger than I thought it was going to be. Do you want to die here, Clement? In this shit-hole, after all that you've been through? The war is finally over. It's time for you to start living again. And you're going to give up? Suffocated in your own grave? Shut the fuck up, George! Why are you speaking? You're dead. You're dead and still bugging me! You'll be joining me soon enough, brother. And for what? Some woman. Some woman you fantasize about who doesn't even remember you? Empty promises of gold. She's here, no? I'm gonna find the Americans and kill those sons of bitches. Yes? Yes! And Marie? What will you do to her, my friend? I love her, she never did anything wrong. Stop! We were the ones who failed her, leaving the cemetery! Keep telling yourself that. Women were always your downfall. She will get you killed and betray you again! I'm getting out of here. And I'll show you who I am! What are you waiting for? Go, now! I'm going to live. I'm gonna live for her. I don't speak no fucking frog. You understand that? Can I tell you a poem? Especially for you Major. Yeah sure. Why not? Feet in the gladiolus, he's sleeping. Smiling like a sick child would smile he takes a nap. Nature rocks him warmly for he's cold. Fragrances do not make his nostrils quiver. He sleeps in the sun. Hands on his chest. He has two red holes on his right side. What the fuck is that supposed to mean? Rimbaud wrote it when he was 16-years-old. It's about a soldier. You are good Marie. You know that? And that smile of yours. I don't think a Nazi had a God damned chance against that smile of yours. Am I right? What was it? Money? Security maybe? I wonder. You know that. I wonder. What they offered you for you to turn on your own God damned country. This song is based on a German children's story. The Little Mermaid. It's about immortal who falls in love with a human and learns that true love can have tragic consequences. It's a fortune. Money means nothing to me. I just need you. You're young and idealistic. Believe it or not I was once very much like you. It's not the gold we need. It's what it buys us. Freedom, security, power. What about the people we've stolen it from? I'm sure the chief of the chancellor in Berlin is not going to be happy. No I mean the people it belonged to before him. What does it matter? It is ours now. I stole this for us. So that when the fighting is over we can live as befits us. And what about this? Won't people know where it's from? Time passes. Wars end. We'll wait until it's safe and then make our escape. The cemetery was a magnificent suggestion my love. Such a prudent place to hide a treasure. Doesn't really matter much anyway. I'm sure you had your reasons. But I'll tell this is for sure. We don't find that fucking gold by sundown you will never smile again. You understand that? Go to hell. Glad we understand each other. Bear them away on your snow white wings to their immortal place. It's a better place now boys with the Lord. This is the nutmeg. Go ahead S2. Be advised Jayhawk noted company strength 2nd SS east of headed due south via Route 44. Confirm. Nutmeg confirmed. Thank you S2. DeGaulle is in Paris. Leclerc and the 2nd Armored Division took it with the help of Eisenhower. It's a fucking joke. Russians have chased us out of Poland, the Allies have us on the run in Italy... and we're officially finished here. We can't surrender to the Bolsheviks, they'll execute us for our uniforms. And of course, our blood tattoos. Life as we know it is over. Le Chemin de la Liberte. There are several secret escape routes over the central Pyrenees into Northern Spain. We'll have safe haven there, and enough time to decide what to do Talk to the men. Those that wish to, may join me. Those that don't can do as they please. Same thing for you. I am with you, herr Von Bruckner. Get firearms and as much ammunition as we can carry. We should march in the evening and through the night. Tell no one our destination. I have one place I must visit on the way. A fraulein, herr Von Bruckner? Marie Dujardin, the girl that we had released from Ravensbruck prison. There was a woman once. Now just another grave. Fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck! You might want to come look at this. We got us a heap of trouble. They're coming down here. Where are we? Right there. That does make this Route 44 Jerry? Sure does. 100 percent. That means they'll be coming down right on top of us here. Yes sir. Company 2nd SS. You're on your own from here. Allied forces are five miles west. I'll hold them as long as I can. Get a move on, do you want to live forever? Company the 2nd SS division. Das Reich. Hitler's elite guard. They ain't looking to give themselves up to two U. S. infantrymen. Heading south. Launch from the beach maybe? There's a chance they just pass us by. Hell no Jerry. Hell no they're coming. I tell you what, you've been right all long. She's been fucking with us since hour one. But I'll tell you this, my old friend. When it comes to this particular little war we've got going on right here. It ain't over just yet. I think it's about time you and I straighten a few things out. When you told me you knew that there was German gold hidden you were telling the truth but you weren't being all together too honest now were you? I've told you no lies. Oh I know there's gold here or so help me I would have cracked your skull and never looked back. Sounds like a good plan boss. But there is gold here Jerry. There is gold because her boyfriend put it here. And he arranged to meet her and she kept her promise. Kraut gets the gold and the girl. No, no. That ain't gonna happen Marie. Want to know why? See your boyfriend. He's still gotta cross the tracks. Navigate his way through the river. Gives us about an hour or so to play a little game Sergeant you remember that game we played in Salerno? Sure do. Bring me a cadaver skull. You got it. If I were you I'd keep real still Marie. Now you're sure there's nothing else you want to tell us? Easy, easy, easy. I ain't the best shot by no means at all. Tell if you know where it is. You want to tell us where that gold is maybe we can all go home. No, no, no, no. You listen to me. Listen to me. That little Kraut pistol ain't worth squat at this distance so you stay real still. That's it little lady. Now. I'm doing my best to remember. I promise. Sun's in his eyes. You sure you got nothing else to tell us? Please. Please don't do this. Bull shit. Stop! I'll show you where the fucking grave is! I'll give you your gold! Untie me. I'll show you. I'll take you. Just stop it! Jerry, you go check on those Krauts. I'm gonna give her one more chance and then we're out of here. Please. It wasn't like you think. You'll understand when I tell you. The cemetery was a magnificent suggestion my love. There was a plan. I knew Von Bruckner planned to be at the cemetery at 10:30. Punctuality was important to him. The housekeeper would pass my note to the resistance to set up an ambush to take back the gold. Wait here. I'll be back. No, no, no don't leave me. Look at this! No. with you. I'm part of the resistance. Where's George? He's supposed to be here. Adieu. Here it is. It hasn't changed a bit. I hope you're not afraid of ghosts. No Marie. I don't fear the dead. Only the living. Here. My sweet SS officer, they're already dead. There's nothing more that can be done to them. There's nothing more they can do to you. Did you know them? Marie? No. It'll be safe here. Nobody comes here anymore. Marie, are you all right? Yeah. I'm fine. I'm just exhausted my love. I want to feel you inside of me. I'm sorry. For what? The resistance was supposed to be waiting at the cemetery but no one was there. So I had to do it alone. When I left I was arrested by the SS. Without Von Bruckner to protect me they said I had no right to be there and threw me in Ravensbruck for three years. Ok. Well Marie, not only are you a French whore but you're a murderer as well. You're family must be proud as punch. The grave belongs to my family. My mother and father were tortured and murdered by an SS officer called Von Bruckner. They were farmers. They would never hurt anyone. They didn't even understand the war. Where Marie? Follow me. This it? Du-jar-din. Maybe lift Jerry? Yep. You wanna try sliding it? Well bless her pea picking little heart. No more digging coal for me. You weren't lying. Ok. Let's pack this up and get the hell out of dodge, Jerry. She's still lying like an old legged dog, Top. There ain't no Kraut in that grave. Impossible. I shot him. Maybe he up and flew away. No, no, no I swear I lifted him and I put him in the grave myself. Don't matter much anymore Marie now does it? We got the gold Jerry. Let's go home. I think now would be a good time for you to kill her and leave her with her parents. Music to my ears boss. Nobody fucking move! Finally, you came back to us. We've been waiting a long time for you, Marie. Grab the bag and bring it here. You ready Jerry? You ok sergeant? Like Old Blue on the porch chewing a big old catfish. The ambush was supposed to be here at the cemetery, not on the road. I waited for you. Look at me! Look at me! Three years I waited! It's not our fault, Marie. The Maquis were afraid we'd been compromised, so they moved the ambush to highway 44. We had to follow orders, Marie. We were ordered to leave here after the ambush went bad. We should have been there for you. They tried to kill me. I'm sorry, Marie. I'm sorry... You're sorry? I looked for you everyday, asked after you, tried to find you. Every day, every day, every day Marie. I spent three years in Ravensbruck jail. After I got out the resistance accused me of being a collaborator. These soldiers got me away from them. Let's get this thing done ay. You got it. Flank me. Have you betrayed us to the Americans? There was nothing I could do. I always wondered whose side you were on. Even three years ago with your Kraut officer. I've made such a mistake. That was your mistake. Your men didn't recognize me. Everything went wrong. You weren't at your cemetery. I shot Von Bruckner and hid the gold. I did the job you couldn't. Excuse me, Marie. Please. Excuse me. Put it down. I was just trying to help you. Don't look that way from where I'm standing. Tell your friend to come on out. I promise I won't shoot him. He wants you to come out. He won't shoot... ...for the moment. You're one clever trickster Marie. He doesn't believe you. Tell him we have no beef with the resistance. There's more than enough gold to go around. They say they just want the gold. Jesus Christ. You good Major? Yeah I'll live. I figure we get that one out of cover, kill 'em both and keep moving. Too late Jerry. SS will be here in minutes. We have to go down the same road that there heading toward. There's no chance we can leave without them seeing us. What you figure? There ain't that many of them Jerry. Way I see it is if we ambush them just right, they won't stand a chance. But we need shooters. What the hell are they talking about?! He says the Germans are coming and if we try to run away we're dead. Ok Marie. You tell him we will let you both live and we will give you a piece of the gold but you gotta help us kill these Nazis. I don't like it but I get it. He wants you to fight with them. They want a real Resistance fighter. They want a real Resistance fighter. I don't understand. Ok keep him talking Jerry. You got it. Come on out my little French badger. Come on. You can come out. So, you in or you out? How we looking? He can see them and they have lots of guns. Come on. Let's get ready. What's he getting excited about? He thinks it's suicide. Whoa Marie. You think it's suicide? Well we figure they're on their way cross-country to Spain. Now the fact that they made a detour here makes us highly suspicious of the lovely Marie. That and the fact that her lover boy's body just happens to not be where she says she left it. I've already told you I don't know why he isn't there anymore. Well, paradise awaits. Let's get to it. Hey Top. I'd say we got about 15 minutes max. Give me that glass. We've got 3 full out. 3 on the hip. 10 extra grenades and some composition from Vic's backpack. What else we got? That's about it Top. It's gonna have to suffice. I guess so. Frenchie. Let's move. Are you serious? Not too close my American friend. Tricky little badger aren't you? Did you really shoot that Kraut, Marie? I shot him in the head. He went down. Pretty sure you can't survive that. He was cold when I moved him. Well you can talk the talk but can you walk the walk? You said you can shoot. Question is can you really? I grew up on a farm. I know guns. Ok. You just follow your instincts Marie and you'll be just fine. You think we'll make it. Well I've always been good at it. Survival, I mean. Never really been good at anything else. That don't mean much in the real world. I don't mean much either. Too poor to paint. Too proud to whitewash. See that's why I need the gold Marie. I need a fresh start. I need to start over. You're mocking me. You think gold pulled from the teeth of Jews, wedding rings stolen from their cold hands, menorahs snatched from their fireplaces doesn't come with a price? Look around you. I didn't hide the gold for myself. I hid it because it's cursed. But I'm an American Marie. We don't believe in spirits. We don't believe in no curses. We believe in gold. Yeah that's right Marie. In gold we trust. All good Top? Yeah I'm good. You ok there Frenchie? When this goes, it will take out their legs without destroying your jeep! That's good. S1 patch me through to bomber command. Thank you. You're welcome. We're probably gonna die here. You know that? I don't know. You regret your part in this? Well I got a whole belly full of regrets since I signed up for this war, Miss. So why did you do it? Why did you come with him? Don't rightly know. Maitland, he's my friend I guess. We're older than the others. Army signed us because they needed mature leaders of men. Men of character. Seems like age doesn't define character quite the way they figured. Maybe it's like you. Sometimes life takes the lead and you've no choice but to follow. Good luck Marie. All that work, the unspeakable sacrifice, all that waiting. All for her and she didn't even glance at you. You really believe the Americans, the "ricains," are gonna split the gold with you? They'll shoot you and bury you with the Krauts, you moron! I'm not going to speak to you. You're dead! I saw you die! Let me do my part, asshole. Don't you fucking dare leave me here, Clement! You're gonna die like me if you don't listen! Hell is waiting for you and it's much worse than you could ever imagine! SHUT UP, MAN! SHUT UP, MAN! SHUT THE FUCK UP! Don't you remember, Clement, I'm dead? Why are you talking to a dead man? I am dead. Viva France! All this death for nothing. And you? You never even managed to tell her you loved her? Bad fucking luck. Picked one that knew how to tangle. Can you move? Feels like I was 'et by a wolf and shit over a cliff. Oh no you'll be just fine my old friend. I've seen lesser men recover from a lot worse buddy. Don't give up do you Top? Never. Never. I may have something to warm you up on the inside. When I was alone I called for backup. Told them there were some Fritz around our location and if we don't call them back with an all clear you have permission to bomb the fuck out of this Goddamned graveyard. Yeah. You see, we die Jerry, they die. No one gets the fucking gold. Let me get that last asshole, Top. Can't move my hand. Give me my shooter. You got it. I got it. I got it. Good. I'll be right back. Don't be long. Jerry! God! Yeah not bad. Not bad at all. You have succeeded in killing a broken regiment. Let's discuss a truce. Marie always had a thing for a man in uniform. No, that's not possible. I shot him. A man who will fight for her. Kill for her. Don't you see? She's using you. You must practice extreme caution with the likes of Marie, Major. German, French, American she makes no distinction. What she wants is simply to achieve her end. Then she will stab you in the back or put a bullet between your eyes. If you're lucky she'll shoot off-center. You're luck has run out Von Bruckner. It warms my heart to hear your voice again. Last time I heard that beautiful voice, you shot me in the face and left me for dead. I hate to break up this beautiful reunion but I'm still here. You pull that trigger, we both die. Marie Look at the monster you have made of me. The look on your face is more painful than your bullet. There's something you two need to know. I called in our location to Air Force control. See, if they don't hear an all clear in about 4 minutes from right now they've got orders to bomb this graveyard in to next fucking year. So I say maybe we put down these guns. We all get a little piece of that Goddamned gold. We can go on our merry little way. Well... what do you say? We got a deal? That's a very wise decision Colonel. No more deals. Marie, we can be together again. Sugar 57 this is Hound Dog 3 over. This is Sugar 57. Hound Dog 3 responding to that... Sugar 57, advise. Over. Roger Hound Dog 3. No cancel command. Repeat, no cancel command. Go ahead and deliver your payload. Over. I understand, Marie. We're coming up on that position. Hound Dog 3 has delivered payload. Good shooting Hound Dog 3. Over. It is over, my angels. No one will have it. It's done.
