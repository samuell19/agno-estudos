The citizens of our town have made it safely through to another day. - Oh yeah. - So come here then. How long you think they're gonna stay safe? - Tough call. - Bald eagles on the rise. Grand streak project halts. - That guy from Caterville's coming in today. Is there anything in the paper about that? - What do you think? - I think the people of this town would appreciate knowing what kind of scum is being paroled in their neighborhoods. - Well, he served his time Wanda. - Oh come on Moe, he was charged with six, convicted on three, with a record like that you and I both know he probably committed others. - Yeah, so what good's he gonna do the community if they know, huh? He's not gonna disappear, the guy won't stand a chance if they find out. - Who says he deserves a chance? - Well, real life hits this town once or twice every couple of years. - Yeah I didn't move back here for real life. - Yeah I know you moved back here for me. - Yeah, maybe I did. - Come on say it. - I moved back here for you. - You mean it? - Yeah, I mean it what do you think? - Listen I know the manufacturers are pushing this stuff, Harry but I gotta tell you for my money, there is nothing better than good old fashioned copper. - You always know best Dwight. - Cheaper too. Eli. - Hey Dwight. - Hey, Harry meet my kid brother. - How you doing pleased to meet you. I'm set thanks great. - Some place you got here. - Hey thanks, it's pretty good huh? Yeah, well hell I'll show you around come on. Sal look who's here. Kelly, this is your uncle Eli. - If you're my uncle how come I never saw you before? - Well... - Dwight, Sally never told me you had a brother. - Oh well you know how Sally likes to keep me to herself. - Good to see you again Sally. - How was your trip? - Good. - How long are you visiting? - Oh he's staying, he's gonna be helping us out around the store. Well hell Elsie business is so good I need another good looking guy around here you know. - Well you'll like it here. Folks are friendly not like other places. - Elsie let me get that bag for you. - Kelly I like your rings. - Thank you. - So, Sally did you tell Eli what time to come for dinner tonight? - You know I didn't have a chance yet. - Well. - How about 8:30. - Six o'clock. - 8:30 geez. - Six, seven 8:30, whatever you say. - Well let's make it six. - You know I need to go call Kelly's piano teacher. You know honey I'm not at all sure that I remembered to call Mrs. Davis about changing your appointment so why don't we go back here and I'll give her a... (knocks) - Come in. Eli Cooley. Sit down. You got in yesterday does your brother know you're here? - Yeah. - When do you start your job? - As soon as I get all my official duties in order. - Okay. These are your conditions of parole. I want you to read this very carefully and then I want you to read it again, would you take the piece of paper please? And then I want you to sign it, take it home and memorize every word. I wanna see you again at this time next week at which time you will be assigned a weekly counseling session but that doesn't mean that you won't see me before then. You can expect to see me during any 24 hour period announced or unannounced at work or at home. - I thought I got to start clean? How's it gonna look with you following me around? - Well as long as you do what you're supposed to do there's no need for anybody to know that we know each other. As far as I'm concerned if we run into each other in public it's like I never laid eyes on you before. Any other questions? - Yeah, how long do we keep on meeting like this? Sounds pretty exciting. - Let's get one thing clear okay. The law says that you have a right to be here and whether I like it or not it's my job to see that you're straight. Now I'm good at my job, let's hope you're good at yours too. - Wanda, it's like the name of a fairy godmother or something. - Yeah, that's right, you just think of me as your fairy godmother watching over every move you make. - Have you ever baked chocolate chip cookies before? - By the thousands. - Really is it hard to bake that many? - Well... - Kelly why don't you come in and help me with the dishes? - Honey let her stay with us. - Okay, all right. - I gotta stretch. - Wanna listen to me read? - Sure. - Do you know this story, "Little Red Riding Hood?" - Oh sure I know "Little Red Riding Hood." In fact the big bad wolf is a real good friend of mine. (growls) - Well, once there was a little girl who lived with her mother in a house at the edge of the forest. The little girl always wore a red cloak and hood that her grandmother had... - Kelly. - He never heard me read before. - I know honey but you shouldn't bother Uncle Eli. - Is everything okay? - Yeah, everything's fine. - It's just close to bedtime. - I bet I'm used to going to bed same time as you. - Say goodnight Kelly. - Goodnight. - Come on. - Thanks for dinner. - Thank you. - You done good Dwight you got a nice house, you got a nice family. - Thanks, you know Sally she's just a little shy with people, it takes her a little while to get used to things. - There's no law saying she's gonna like me. - No, no, that's okay she'll come around, I know her. (dramatic music) - Over here, over here, come here. The Cavaliers won, 108, 103 but the Knicks are still ahead four games in the division. I think that if Jordy plays D and Hot Rod plays low the Cavs can pull it out and win the division. - Do you play ball? - Uh-huh. - Does he bite? - He can. - What's his name? - His name's Fred. What's yours? - Cody, how come you called him Fred? - I used to have a best friend named Fred. - Is the dog your best friend now? - He's my only friend. - Cody! Didn't you hear me calling? - Mom he has a dog named Fred and he's his best friend. - Is he giving you the third degree? - Pretty much. - I'm sorry, I'm Annie Hopkins, Cody's mother, we live next door. I bet you like it here. Come on you'll be late. - Fred, come here boy, this way. Here let me get that for you. - Oh thank you. - It's a good deal. - Thanks for your help. - Wait a minute this one's already open, I'll get you a fresh one. - That oughta do it. - Sally, you're brother-in-law's really helpful. - Eli's been real quick at picking up the store. - I can see that. - So I'll come by and pick up that prescription. - I'll bring it by to you on the way from the pharmacy okay. - Here you go. - Thanks. - Hey so I hear you play a little ball, huh? - Oh I just fool around, I'm not a real player. Can I get in here Sally? - Sure. Dwight's a deputy. - What a relief. I'm looking for those Wheeler orders. - They're over here. - Thanks boss. - He seems nice, is he married? - No. - I was just thinking that maybe I could set him up with Holly. - He's just, he's not available. - Oh, okay. (dramatic music) - [Woman] You have your bag with you, you're gonna work during recess? - You take care now. Hi how are you today? - Fine, yourself? - Oh couldn't be better. Wanda, am I glad to see you, guess what? - What? - I'm moving to the city as soon as I have enough money saved. That's what you did isn't it? - Yeah something like that. - I told my mother and you'd think this was the only town in the world. I mean, how did you get the nerve to go? - Oh you'll figure it out. - I wish you could just tell me how. - Thanks hardly anybody ever does that. - How much do I owe you? - $3.99. - Gosh I can't tell you how many times I wished people would do that. - Keep the change. - I can't do that. - Wow if that wasn't nice. (tires squeal) - Hi. - Hi. Is there something you wanna say? - No, I saw Eli Cooley in Holly Benson's check out line, it took everything I had to keep me from pulling her away from him. - Did he bother her? Anybody else? - Yeah, me. It was one thing knowing he was coming, but seeing him, talking to him, you know when my cases left the office in Chicago, I didn't see them again, they don't live in the same neighborhood. But this town is one neighborhood. I don't want that man near anyone I know. - He's a free man Wanda. - Yeah, but he shouldn't be. (laughs) (hip hop music) (knocks) - Don't tell me you were in neighborhood. - I wasn't. - Well I'm here good enough? Music's against the law? The maid called in sick today. Hey lady a little privacy. - There is no privacy here, parole is an extension of prison. You a cabinet maker? - Uh-huh. - Just make sure those tools stay home. - Did you make these soldiers? - My father made them when I was a kid. - They're beautiful. - He was good with his hands. You wanna tell me your life story. Oh not part of the deal. - So, what do you wanna do Eli? Come on you got a goal. - I got a cabin I built, I'd like to get back there, get away from everybody. - Well, you play your cards right that just might happen. (dog barks) Fred! Fred, Fred come here. - No, no it's okay. That was Cody's plan. - The kid's curious, well that's good. - We've moved around a lot he's met a lot of different people. He asked me if I thought - Mom. you would like to be our friend. Here please, sit down. - Come on Fred. - Thank you. - Cody will be thrilled. - This looks good. - It took me a long time to find a place to live where I could feel safe enough to keep a window open. It's nice to feel a breeze again. - Yeah, it sure is, it's one of those things you don't think about unless you've been inside too long. - Where were you before you came out here? - By the river down south. - Why'd you come up here? - Time to go. (hip hop music) One and three-quarters, four and a half, we're in. (dramatic music) - The new 290's. - Oh Moe, you're killing me. - Harley, I'm fresh out of work, I'll do these for you. - You are an angel. - It's gonna cost you. (dramatic music) Cody, Cody get in the house. Come on, come on, get in the house. - But I wanna pet Fred. - I don't care get in the house. - Hey, you dropped your groceries. (knocks) Your groceries, you dropped them. - I know who you are. - What do you know? - You are a rapist. You have raped god knows how many women. - He's on parole Henry, he's charged with six counts of rape, convicted on three of them. - You told me no one would know. - Get right back to you. - You said that wouldn't happen. - Now look, I never guaranteed you anything. You've got a record there is nothing I can do about that. - Yeah, no matter what I do, no matter what I do, that's all people are gonna see. Look, I did my time. I'm not gonna have some bitch next door send me back to prison. - Look, I'm your parole officer and I am the only one who decides whether you go back to prison or not. - The people in this town will never go along with that. - People of this town are decent, law-abiding citizens. - Oh cut the crap, they'll be out for me and you know it. I served seven years, I paid for what I did. - You got off easy. Those women you raped, they're the ones who are paying for it. - I didn't hurt anybody. - Do you believe that, do you really believe that. - Hey, your job is to help me. You're not helping. - You break the terms of your parole and I'm gonna put your butt right back in prison. Now if I was you I'd come over here and sit down because you got no one else but me. You shall not own, use or... - I read it. - Or have access to any dangerous weapons. You shall not loiter where women congregate. You will go to a weekly counseling session for sex offenders, every Wednesday night, all right at seven o'clock. That's at the parole outpatient clinic in Fairvale. You know where Fairvale is don't you? - No. - Well find it. Now your job is to prove to people that their fears about you are wrong. Now part of my job is to see that you get back into the community. There's a town meeting at the VFW tonight. - I can't go. I got parole clinic in Fairview. - Fairvale, right. Well, I'm going to be there and I'm gonna stand up in front of people I know and tell them that your release papers indicate that you're a good candidate for rehabilitation. And on the slight chance that that is true, I will also inform them that the law demands that you be given the opportunity to rejoin a community of your peers. But it's up to you Eli, it's up to you. - Hey. The place is real empty, looks like word's gotten around. I'm sorry. - Hey look I knew when I brought you here that this could happen. And if folks found out it could get a little tough. And it was still something that I wanted to do. I gotta tell you I can't stop thinking about this Eli. I mean, I tried and tried, I just don't get it. How could you do what you did? - You want me out of here you just say so. - No, no, no, no, that is not what I'm saying. I just wanna understand. - What do you wanna know Dwight? - You know what I'm asking. - How'd I do it? It was easy most of them just lay there. - You committed rape. - What do you want me to say? - I want you to say something that tells me how my brother could do something like that. So I could stand here in my empty store and say that's okay 'cause at least I'm helping him out. - Things were going bad at home. The wife was on me about everything, money, the kid. One night I spotted a woman, broke into her house and raped her. - Why? - I just had to. - He served seven years for a 15 year sentence. It was reduced for good time. Look, that's the law Henry, if you don't like it change the law, bye. - Maybe you should keep closer tabs on the routine paperwork around your station. - The guy's a rapist, he registered with the police. - Yeah, it was supposed to stay with the police. - You're the one who was railing about the community notification law. Now everybody knows, you got what you want. - Yeah, well this isn't the way I wanted them to find out. - Wanda, nobody's gonna be happy about having this guy in our town no matter how they find out. - Hey, it wasn't my idea to parole him. But now he's my responsibility. - That's right, he's your responsibility. (audience exclaims) - Then why weren't we told he was coming here? - You weren't told because we don't have the community notification law in this state. Now it was thought best to avoid unnecessary alarm that we keep the news of his move here within the law enforcement community. (audience exclaims) - For what were you waiting for him to rape somebody? - Eli Cooley is considered a good candidate for rehabilitation. - [Woman] In who's eyes. - What's that mean, what's the percentage of these guys repeating the crime? - I don't know the exact statistics right now. - What kind of guarantees are you guys gonna give us? - There are no guarantees Clay. - Rehabilitation does not work with these guys. Moe, how could you let her do this? - All right, first of all, let me say that I agreed with Wanda. - Oh come on Moe, you don't have a wife and kids. - I've got a mother and two sisters that live in this town Clay and secondly, Wanda doesn't take orders from me, she works for the Department of Corrections. - Well then tell the Department of Corrections to find some other place for this guy to live. (audience exclaims) - Now we can't do that Mavis. He's done nothing to break the law here. - I have lived in this town for 56 years. But tonight for the first time in my life, I was frightened to leave my house. - [Man] It's not right. - I'm too old to start being frightened. - [Man] That's right. - Yes, what about our right to feel safe, doesn't that count for anything? - Of course it does but under the law, Eli Cooley has paid his debt to society. - Well tell that to the women that he raped. Wanda how can you as a woman and as our friend stand up there and talk about what he's entitled to? I mean, what about us? - Yes. - Really. - Can you tell us he won't rape again? - You know I can't Terry. - Then how can you put us in this kind of danger? - Look, this is hard for me. And as a woman and as a member of this community, I hate what Eli Cooley has done just as much as each and every one of you but it is my job to oversee the terms of his parole. And it is my job to protect you. - The only way you can really protect us is to get rid of him. - Or lock him up for good. - I say that's why we have capital punishment for, guys like him. (applause) - I'd like to say something, I'd like to say something about this. Since it's my family that we're talking about here. You know Sally and I go to church with all of you every Sunday. We all pray together. If I remember it right, what the scripture says, Lord how many times shall my brother sin against me and I shall forgive him? What it's 70 times seven isn't that right? Well in church you all seem fine with the notion of forgiveness. But I'm not asking you to forget what my brother's done. What he did was wrong, it was horribly wrong. But trust me he's trying. So I am here to ask you to forgive him and to say that if anything should happen with him, then I will take full responsibility. - Oh how are you gonna do that Dwight? - What are you gonna do Dwight, hand over Sally? - Oh Clay. - Clay, you are wrong if you think that Dwight and I are any less upset than you or than any of you are. But you need to know that this is about our family as well. And there are things that we need to deal with, privately. - I'm just asking you to give my brother a chance. God all of you came into my store and you told me how much you liked him. Well the guy that you saw there was no show. That's my brother. - Dwight, we all like and respect you but I'm not willing to wait for something to happen. Your brother doesn't belong here, get him out. (audience exclaims) - Empathy, anyone wanna tell me what empathy is? Roger? - None of us got any. (laughs) - And without it chances are you'll repeat your crime and do time again. You looking forward to that Horace. So maybe you can fill us in a little bit about empathy. - Empathy is being able to feel what somebody else is feeling. - Like a baby that cries. Like one of the women you raped. Empathy's one of the keys to stop you from raping again knowing your victim is a person like yourself. Now got a new member tonight. (claps) - I've been in groups before, I know the drill. - Horace let's start with you. - Horace Mansfield, two counts of robbery, rape, assault and battery. - Roger. - Roger Doyle, kidnapping, grand theft auto. - And rape. - Nah, she wanted it. (laughs) - Come on. - No one wants to be raped. Eli. - Eli Cooley three counts robbery, breaking and entering, aggravated rape. - That's what you were convicted of, what did you do? - I just told you. - You just told me your record. I wanna hear you describe in your own words what you did, breaking and entering into what, a market, a video store? - A woman's house. - How through the front door? - A window. - You broke in through a window then what'd you do? - I raped her. - How? - I'll give you three guesses. - Okay, she was sitting there, she was standing there, she was washing dishes? - She was sleeping. - And all you told us was you raped her, what'd you do wake her up, whip it out and say howdy? - I had a gun with me? - Where in your pocket. - It was at her head. - You held a gun to her head. And she woke up and... - And I said say one word and I'll put a bullet through your head. - And all you said you did was rape her. I have a tape I'm going to play for you, I want you to listen to it. - He broke in the door. - He broke in. Ma'am are you still there? - Uh-huh. - [Man] Shut the bedroom door, lock it if you can and come right back to the phone. - He's at the door. - What? - He's at the door, he's here, he's here. - Tell him you've got the police on the phone. - I've got the police on the phone. Who are you, why are you here! I've got the police on the phone, I got the police on the phone, why are you here! Why are you here, why, why, why, why! (sighs) - What did you think? - I feel bad. - Why? - It scared her pretty good. - Eli what'd you feel? - I don't know what's to feel? - You tell me? - She's a stranger I don't know her. I didn't feel anything. (dramatic music) - Oh man, I wanted to go to the city so bad. I wanted help in a big way. I wanted to change things. I didn't change anything. - You changed my life. - Yeah well all I want now is a robbery at the five and a dime and maybe a few bicycle thieves. - Sounds romantic. (laughs) - You know tonight when I was standing up there in front of everybody, giving the party line, what I really wanted to say to them was Eli Cooley is a time bomb. - That's not your job. - Yeah, well sometimes my job feels like dirty work Moe. - Sometimes it is. - These are my friends. I just wanna protect them. - Look, the fact is Cooley got out of prison with a better situation than most. I mean, he's got a job, he's got a family that supports him. If anybody can make it, it could be him. (tires squeal) (dramatic music) - [Man] Let's go, get out of our town. We don't want you in our town! (audience exclaims) - [Man] Get out of our town! We don't want you in our town! - You don't belong here! - You don't belong anywhere but jail! (audience exclaims) (audience chants) - Go, go, go, go, go! - Get out right now! - Out, go, out, out, out, out, out, out, out! Go out, out, out, out, out! (dramatic music) - You can rip it up but there will be more. - I never did anything to you. - You might as well have. - Oh yeah, like what? - I was raped by someone like you 20 years ago. - That's got nothing to do with me. - Yesterday do you know what I did when I walked down the street? - How should I know. - I tell you I walked there, not on the sidewalk, because some man might pass me and he might grab me and he might put a knife at my throat and he might say shut up or I'll cut your throat. Shut up or I'll cut your throat. - I'm not the man who raped you. - But you are a rapist aren't you? And the man who raped me doesn't know what happened after he left. I lost my marriage along the way. My husband couldn't live with the fact that I didn't feel safe anywhere. Well here's something even my husband didn't know. I brush my teeth, maybe eight, 10 times a day, 20 years and I'm still brushing my teeth trying to get the taste out of my mouth. (cries) - It wasn't me. Look, all I want is to be left alone and live my life. - That's funny, that's what I want too. And before you came here, that's what I was doing, I could go just about anywhere alone, I could sleep in my house alone. But with you here, it's like I was raped all over again. - I never touched you lady. - When I was raped something had broke in me but I was putting the pieces back together! But with you here all I have are those pieces and as long as you stay that's all I'll be so I cannot have you living next door no matter what you do or don't do! Whatever it takes I am going to get you out of here! - Anybody here? Dwight? - Yep? - Hi. Is Eli around? - He's not in right now, Wanda. We're not very busy these days. - He didn't tell me that you'd changed his hours. - Yeah well it was a last minute thing. - Oh, do you know where he is? - No, I don't keep tabs on him. You know I thought we made an agreement... - Hey Sally. - Hi Wanda. - When we made the arrangements to bring him here, I mean isn't the point of all this to let him know we can trust what he's doing? - Over time. - Well, Eli just works for me, I thought it was your job to be my brother's keeper. - Yeah but Dwight you're his brother. (children chattering) - Hi Mom. - Hi Nina. - How was school today? - It was good. (dramatic music) - Robin. Robin, Robin, come on. No, no, no, no, don't touch that. Come on. - I'm closed. - I'm open. - What are you doing Holly? - We all heard Wanda last night. He deserves to shop here just as much as anybody else. I'm open. (car revs) Come on Fred. - Hey what's going on? - You tell me. What do these people here want from me, huh? - Man you can't let them get to you. - No, what do you suggest I pretend like nothing's going on and let them string me up. - Hey, hey, come on I came to get you to go play some basketball. - Forget it. - Wait a minute here, what are you gonna do? Now are you gonna let them live your life for you? You have a right to live the same as they do. You can't give in. Come on here, huh, come on, let's go play some ball, it'll be good for you, come and play. - Yeah, kick some butt. - Yeah all right let's go. - Yeah. - Cooley brothers. - Yeah, we'll burn up the court. - Hey this is great. - Yeah, Fred's gonna like it. - Why'd you wanna build a dog house for? - Why not somebody should have the house of his dreams. (chatter) - Big five, come on. - Hey, okay here you go Clay, we'll play. - I'm not playing on the same court as him. - No way man. - Hey come on, come on. Eli wait you stay right there. Come on man let's play. Johnny will play on the spot, Clay let's go come on. Come on, we got three let's go. He's good, let's play. - All right. - All right. - Here we go. - All right. - What you got. - Clay you take him. - Check. - Dwight you gotta pass. (hollers) - Hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey. Eli, Eli. - I see you go near my wife and kids and I'll kill you, I swear to god, I'll kill you. - Okay I'll see you, hang in there. - Hello Eli. - What do you want? - I wanna ask you a few questions. - Ask them some other time. - I'm here now. - Someone could say you were asking for it lady. - I went to the store this morning and you weren't there, I came here and you weren't home, where were you? - That's my business. - Nothing's your business. I got a phone call today. A man who fits your description was seen taking pictures outside Sunbrier Elementary School. I didn't know kids were your thing Eli, have you changed your style. - She's my daughter, Nina. She's my kid, she belongs to me. - When was the last time you were with her? - Seven years ago, right before I went in. - She visit you? - Nobody visited me. - Is this her mother? - Yeah, Laura, divorced me as soon as I got inside, and then she got a restraining order, so I could never see Nina. - Judges aren't crazy about convicted rapists. Did you go see her because you missed her or because you knew you weren't supposed to. - You don't have kids, if you did you wouldn't ask me that. - You're doing well Eli, I don't wanna see you mess things up. - If this is doing well, I ain't gonna make it. - You find a way. - Hi, what are you doing here, you miss me? - What's you find out about the pictures? - It's his daughter. He hasn't seen her for seven years. He misses her. - Well, I'm glad you're feeling better about him. I just got this. - White female, 28, has she identified anybody? - Seems she's in a bad way. Where was he last night, do you know? - No. - Wanda, Wanda look, we both know these guys. Hey come on he's a repeat offender. Hey, come on, I don't care whether he's got a chance or not, I want him out of here. - Let's go. - Okay Fred that's it come on boy. (whistles) Try it out, come here boy try it out. Come on. Okay don't move. Put your hands where I can see them. (police sirens) Victim reports she was awakened at approximately 2 a.m. by a white male holding a gun to her head and ordering her to undress when she resisted her attacker threatened to blow her away. The victim then complied and when she asked her attacker not to hurt her he pushed the gun against her head and repeated say another word and I'll blow you away, stop me when this is no longer familiar. - I don't know what you're talking about. - Entry through a window, a gun, a pillow over her face so she couldn't see you, that's your M.O. if I'm not mistaken. - I didn't do nothing. - Even taking a lipstick as a little memento. - I didn't do nothing. - You have to prove that. - How I was sleeping, Fred was the only one here. You wanna put me in prison, you go right ahead, that's what you've been itching to do. - No, take him in. I'm holding you on suspicion Eli. - What makes you so sure I did it? - I said suspicion, you're the one who said you did it. - Hey what about my dog? - I'll make sure he gets fed. Yeah she changed her mind about the I.D., well not all of them can go through it Pam. Are you ready for this, the semen sample, the rapist wore a condom. - Oh that's consideration, what are you looking for, a similar M.O. - Listen can I have lunch with you, I really need to talk to you. - [Pam] Meet me at the clinic and we'll go to the park. - Okay, okay, listen I gotta go bye. - There was a rape in Elridge. - Yeah, I know, I know it's horrible. - Did you contact the parole board yet? - No, I haven't. - Wanda you locked Eli Cooley up. - Look, there's no evidence that says Eli Cooley even committed this rape. - Well did you question him? - Of course I did, I took every step possible but legally we don't have anything we can hold him with. - He's a serial rapist. - Look, this is a list of all the convicted rapists in the area and these are only the names I've had a chance to go through. Eli Cooley is only one of them. - Are you saying that you're not going to send him back to prison? - I'm saying that if I don't have any evidence linking him to the rape, I'm gonna have to release him from jail today. - What. - Oh my god. - We talked to the police chief in Elridge, there are vast inconsistencies in the victim's report now that's not unusual in a trauma case like this but she's also decided not to pursue the investigation. - So he just gets off. - Wanda how can you release him? - I can't hold someone indefinitely Terry if I don't have anything to charge him with. - [Man] After what he's done? - Look, I'm sorry but I don't want us to be against each other. - Well then protect us. - I am, I'm gonna keep him under even stricter surveillance. - What has happened to you Wanda, you move to the city, you move back here and now you think you have the right to sacrifice us. - It's not a right Mavis, it's the law. - What's it gonna take for you to do anything Wanda? - Does he need to rape someone here? - Most of these guys see themselves as victims. You tell them rape is not about sex, rape is about power. And none of these guys feel like they have any power. They don't get that the way they feel powerful is by going out and committing rape. - Well the last time Eli was in group, how did he seem? - He's still angry but we're trying to get them to recognize when their anger turns into rape fantasies and to be able to substitute other ways to act on it. - I don't know what to do. I hate guys like him and I don't want him around but I can't send him back to prison just because I feel that way and I don't have anything to hold him with. And every time I think about releasing him. - Okay for the record, he's better off than most. He's got a job, a family that's there for him. - I know you should see the house he built for his dog. - Okay so he loves his dog, I mean, that could be a good sign. But there's no blueprint for these guys. What I'm trying to work on with them is taking responsibility for what they've done. Most of these guys don't even think they've done anything wrong. - So is treatment gonna work? - When I first started out, we used to say the goal was for these guys never to reoffend but after working with them, now we say the goal is to make it less likely. - Yeah, but I'm talking about releasing him today into my community, is he gonna rape again. - What can I tell you, give me these guys when they're young when they're kids and I'll tell you I can help them. But by the time I get them most of them are already gone. And most of the programs for sex offenders have been cut inside prison and outside. No one wants to hear about adult sex offenders anymore unless they're in prison. - People I've known my whole life won't even look at me. - Wanda, these guys are at risk of reoffending for the rest of their lives. You've been doing this as long as I have. At a certain point you've gotta go with your gut. - This ankle transmitter sends a signal to this monitor which will be hooked up to the phone lines in your house. The yellow light's on when you're home, it's off when you're out and it comes back on when you return, okay. And the whole thing is connected to the host computer here at the station. It's all programmed if you leave the house after 7:30 p.m. the computer spits out a piece of paper and let's me know that you're off limits. You can feed Fred but don't leave the yard. Now by day you can go to work or the market. It's also programmed so you can attend the rape clinics on Wednesday nights as long as you log in and log out. You got 20 minutes to get there and 20 minutes to get back. Otherwise you leave your house at 7:30 you've broken curfew and I'll roll you up and take you in. And don't mess around with that, the computer will let me know about that too. - You better find the guy who did it 'cause he's screwing things for me, I'm not supposed to be a prisoner anymore. - You're getting out of jail man and that's all you should care about. Now with this on if anything else happens you can prove where you were. Harley take him home and do the installation. - Okay, come on, stand up. - Come on let's go. - Hey, Eli you ever rape a woman with kids in their house? - No. - That woman in Elridge had two children in the next room. - I didn't rape her. - Can I talk to you for a second? - There's no evidence Moe. Now whether I want to or not I can't hold him on anything, legally he's got his rights you know that. - Even if he didn't rape that woman in Elridge, you and I both know it's only a matter of time before he does it again. You said yourself he's a time bomb. - And you said he deserves a second chance. - A woman was raped. I'm not the one who's talking like a social worker anymore. - That is so out of line, this is my case, I've decided he's released. - Right, you've decided. (phone rings) - Yeah. - Cooley don't get too comfortable, we're watching you. - You go right ahead slimebag. And you, you're not gonna get me. - You can't run with me today Fred, there's not enough time left. Here boy, stay here, I'll be back. (horn blows) (tires squeal) Okay I'm home. I'm home. Come on I'm back. Hey, hey I'm back, come on, turn on the light, come on you son of a bitch! Hey Fred. Fred, come on boy. Cody, you got Fred over there? Here boy. There you are. (dramatic music) What did they do to you boy. (dramatic music) No one touches him, no one touches him! - Hey come on easy, easy. - Let go of me! - Easy, easy. - You never gave a damn about me before why now? - I owe it to you. - You owe it to me for what? - I knew about it. The old guy, I saw him. God when I saw you building that, I could not get it out of my mind. - Shut up boy. - He chained you to the back of the house. He made you eat from the same bowl. - I said shut up! - I used to watch from the bedroom window and I'd see him drag you out there. You laying on the ground next to the dog and I'd hear you begging him. I never did anything. - Why not? - I was afraid. - Hi, I heard about Fred, this stinks. - Yeah, I don't see you putting any of your friends in prison for it. - People of this town have a right to feel the way they do about you Eli. They hate what you've done and they're terrified of what you might do. - Fred never did nothing to any of them. - No, he was a victim, just like your victims. They didn't do anything to you either. - You get out of here. - I'm sorry, I know you loved your dog. - What do you know about love. Do you know something about love. - That's none of your business. - I bet you do. - You ever wander if I'm gonna hurt you? - No. - You ever afraid of me? - No. - What makes you so different, what you got a gun. Are you wearing that gun, is it close to you. - Raping me is not gonna bring Fred back Eli no matter how angry you are. - You shut your mouth. - Or what you'll blow my brains out. Isn't that what you say to them? - I said shut up. - You're not gonna rape me and you know it. You like your victims easier, I'm not sleeping, I'm not defenseless and I can put you back in prison. - You think you are one tough bitch don't you? - I know I am, now you move one inch closer and I'll have you under arrest for attempted rape. Now if I were I'd move back, now. Don't you ever do that again with anyone. You find another way to express your sorrow. - You think you got me all figured out don't you? - Like I said I know you loved your dog. - I hope that scum gets what's coming to him like maybe dying in the chair or shot. Just as long as he gets it. - Thanks Horace. - Why don't you go next, Eli. - I didn't do it. - The assignment was for everyone to write a letter from his victim. - How the hell should I know what my victim feels. - Okay, you had six victims choose one. Your last one you remember her? I'll help you. White, age 26, asked if you were going to hurt her. Forced oral copulation, forced vaginal penetration, forced her into her closet. - Yeah I remember. - Did you know this woman? - No. - Never saw her before. - Yeah I saw her. - You stalked her. - I knew where she lived. - So you were cruising looking for someone you saw her what going to her house through a window. - First I saw her going to her house. Then I saw her through the window. - And you went in. - I came back the next night. - So you spent the time until then making a plan and fantasizing what you wanted to do to her. - Yeah you could say that. - Then what happened, then what'd you do? - I went back to her place, got myself in and I raped her. - Just like that. - No fuss, no muss. - But what was she doing this 26-year-old woman, Martha, that's her name right? - We didn't introduce ourselves. She was sleeping I woke her up. - How? - Touched her on her leg, her arm, I don't know. She woke up. What what happened next? I told her to undress. - What did Martha do when you told her to undress? - I don't remember. She asked me if I was gonna hurt her. - And what did you say. - I put the gun to her head and I told her I'd kill her if she didn't do what I said. - What was the look on her face, what do you think Martha was feeling? - How the hell should I know? - Well, did she look happy, sad! - I don't know it was dark I didn't see much. Maybe she was crying. - She was crying, Martha, why? You ever cry Eli. - Yeah I've cried. - What makes you cry. - Feeling sad, scared. - You think maybe Martha could have felt like that? - I didn't hurt her. - You raped her Eli, you put a gun to her head and told her you would kill her. Why do you think Martha cried, what did it sound like. Did it sound like this. - [Woman] Who are you, why are you here! - [Man] Get in the bedroom now! - [Woman] I got the police on the phone, I got the police on the phone, why are you here! Why are you here, why, why, why, why! - Is that what Martha sounded like? - She was scared, I scared her. (dramatic music) - Hey I thought we were supposed to meet at my place? - Yeah I was just gonna call you. Look, I found this guy Jasper Morris, he's got the same M.O. as Eli, right down to the lipstick. Only problem is he's still in Caterville. - Well, doesn't do you much good then does it? - Is that what you came over here to tell me. Don't you think I've thought about that, I've gone over Eli's records again and again, every woman he raped was single. The woman in Elridge, she had kids in the next room. - Okay, so what am I to order? - He says I'm always careful, he doesn't like surprises. Kids are way, way too much of a wild card. - Look, look I don't care about his M.O., you should have put this guy back in prison, I'm telling you, if it wasn't for my relationship with you I would have made sure that happened. - Doesn't it matter to you that this time he might actually be innocent? - As a man who lives in this town, no. And don't tell me you feel any differently. (dramatic music) There's a 57 minute gap between the time he logged out of the Fairvale clinic and when the monitor picked him up at home. - She back from the hospital? - Yeah. - Forensics have what they need? She in the back then. - Yes. - Hey Patty can we be alone, she's a friend of mine. - Oh honey, oh honey, who did this to you? Oh sweetheart. (door slams) - Police! - Clear that, clear that! All right go, go, go! - I got him here! - Put your hands up! Hands up! Show me your hands! Hands up, hands up! - Show me your hands, show me your hands! - What's going on? My radio bracelet's on I got no way to go... - Get out! - What! - I want it now! - Why what do you want! - I want the trophy that you took last night! - What trophy? - I want the lipstick! - What happened now! - I am gonna make sure that when they lock you up this time they keep you until you die! - You got the wrong guy. - And when they bury you I'm gonna make sure that no one forgets who you are and what you've done! - You've got the wrong guy, I was at the clinic! - The computer says it took you 57 minutes to make a 20 minute trip. I ran out of gas! - Holy Benson was raped last night! - It wasn't me! - Hey! - Come on do something so I can kill you! I got a present for you Eli! Sit down. Maybe this will refresh your memory. - He had a gun and he told me to take all my clothes off and get down on the floor. I didn't want to. I asked him why he was doing this to me? But all he says is that if I didn't shut up he'd kill me. Then he forced me, he made me (cries) I thought I was gonna die. I was afraid he was gonna kill me. I was afraid I was gonna die. - I know her. She was nice to me. (glass breaks) - Get him down! (hollers) Back, back! - This male is under the protection of the United States law enforcement agency. - You don't take him anywhere unless you take him to prison. - If anyone of you harms him you will be subject to arrest. - What about Holly! (hollers) - You stupid bastards! - We're your friends you filthy scum. - Come on now don't make me do something none of us want. - You're an idiot! - Back off everybody! - Holly didn't have any guns to protect her! - You idiots! - Get back! - Get him out of here! (yelling) (police siren blares) - Harley! - Yeah! - I want three units to come help Stevenson Hall, we got a situation building here. - The situations a freaking lynch mob. - I'd keep my mouth shut if I were you, take him to the back will you? - What, what are they gonna do to me? - Trying to keep you from getting killed. - If we can. - [Harley] We got a code two in progress as soon as you can. (phone rings) - Yeah, yeah, okay right. Hey listen Moe, I think I got something here. (hollers) (dramatic music) - You got any idea how hot it's getting around here, I got a near riot on my hands. - Jasper Morris is the one I told you about. He's got the same M.O. as Eli, his file says he was in prison, but his parole day got bumped up. It's delayed before it got into the computer. - [Moe] Yeah, so. - He got out of prison on the same day as the rape in Elridge Moe. - All right, we follow up on it but there's still no proof that Cooley's innocent. It's not gonna quiet down that mob out there. Harley I want a couple of shotguns up here now. Look they want him real bad. And I don't wanna have to shoot somebody I know. - Okay, I parked by the basement exit, in the garage, I'm gonna take him to his brother's. At least he's one of your deputies, Moe, it's the best chance we've got. - Okay maybe it'll buy us some time, get him out of here. Guys, come on I want the body bunkers up here right now. Go, go. (yelling) Everybody listen to me hold it! - Just get down Eli, let's do it, let's go, cover him. - Let me talk, please Henry, he's here and I cannot let you in, I can't let any of you in. - What are you waiting for him to kill someone! - Henry, back down. - 'Cause I can tell you he won't last that long! (yelling) - You're responsible for this Wanda, you brought him here and now you're running! (dramatic music) - Okay now, you call yourself a deputy or your brother's keeper. I don't wanna see anything go wrong here. - Like what. - Deciding you like being a brother more than being a law enforcement officer. I'll be back, I'll be back. (phone rings) - That's the fifth time already this morning! What if they find out he's here, Kelly, Kelly, get your backpack for school! - Hello? - [Woman] Sally how does it feel to be related to a rapist. - Stop it, stop it! - [Dwight] Okay Sally come on... - [Sally] Don't tell me he had a rough time growing up! You had a rough time growing up too and you do not rape women! - All right stop it you want him to hear you, he's right in there. - I don't care if he hears me. - [Dwight] Well come on what do you want me to do? - Do something... - Well we're all a little stuck here don't you think? - Hey Uncle Eli. - Hi Kelly. - Will you stay until I get home from school? - Well we'll have to see what happens. - That's what my mom always says. Are you a bad guy Uncle Eli? - I'm trying not to be. - I've gotta go to school now. - Okay Kelly come on let's go to school. Eli what are you doing, what are you doing? - Daddy, Daddy he didn't do anything. - Oh god, Sally get Kelly take her to school. - Dwight? - Just do it. - Come on honey. - Oh my, oh my god. Oh my god. I have never been able to do anything to help you. I don't even know how. What can I do? - Where are your car keys? - God Eli where is there for you to go? - I don't know yet but I'm not staying here. I'll leave your car at my place. - That's a hell of a risk if anybody should even see you. - The whole town's over at the police station. Thanks. - You can't go like that, let me just get you a jacket. (dramatic music) (laughs) (phone rings) - Hello. - It's me. I'm gone. - Where are you Eli? - I'm where I wanna be. - Eli you gotta come back. - I can't do that, I don't belong there. I don't trust myself there. - [Sally] If you don't come back I'm gonna have to report you. - Well you do what you have to do. I'm just calling to let you know I ain't coming back. - I think I know where he is. - All right, okay go ahead we're right behind you. - All right now Moe if he comes out on his own. - Look I'm here to catch him not kill him. Hey watch yourself. (thunder roars) - Eli! Eli (thunder roars) If you come out now nobody's gonna get hurt. Okay I'm gonna come in, I'm all alone I just wanna talk to you now. Nice and easy. (thunder roars) - The battery's dead, drop the gun. Kick it over here. (thunder roars) - Is this the house you built? - Yeah every board, every nail. How many cops are with you? - Enough. - Move this way, slowly. - I'm tracking another suspect Eli. They're investigating him right now. - Why are you telling me this for? - Because if what you say is true and you didn't do it, if you turn yourself in right now you won't have to go back to prison. - Still got a world away to go. (thunder roars) What do you see when you look at me? - I see a man. - No you don't. All you see is a rapist. That's all I see too. (gun fires) - Let's go in! (gun fires) - No! - The suspect's down help him. - Come on. (dramatic music) - That's about it. - You'd think they all wanna come out and help. Get rid of me faster! - They all know they caught the guy who raped Holly, admitted it and everything he's already back in prison. - So the right bad guy got punished huh? You got what you want, are you satisfied. - If you can rape a woman once, you can do it again. No one can ever convince me that it won't happen. - Who gave you the right to decide. - Someone like you, I'm your legacy. I want you to tell me something, what does it feel like to hate women so much? - I don't hate you. - Tell that to the women you raped. - I was looking to get someone those nights, they were there it was nothing personal. - Nothing personal. (dramatic music) - You ready? - Start the countdown. You take care of your family, Dwight. - You take care of yourself Eli. (dramatic music) - This facility is minimum security but you'll be safe here. - Yeah, no one to bother me and I can't bother anyone. - Well we're still looking for another place for you. - I got a house, trees, 24 hour security. You still gonna make your drive by visits? - No you don't need me anymore, you'll be protected here. You're not a prisoner, you can come and go as you please. - You went out of your way for me, thanks. - Well I didn't do it for you. I did it because I believed, I believed it was right. Hope things stay quiet for you Eli. I really hope you keep it that way. - I'll be working on it. - Good luck. (dramatic music) (dramatic music) (Multicom jingle)
