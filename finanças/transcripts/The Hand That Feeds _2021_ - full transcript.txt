"Intro Sound" [intense music] [low rubmle] [creaking] [mysterious music] How could you understand? Just an idiot kid! [pained groaning] [unintelligible ominous whisper] Hello? [rising strings] [percussive music] [sirens] [imposing music] I'm Agent Reynolds, this is Agent Jermaine. Who's been inside? Only the forensics team that you sent over. Alright, good. In about 5 minutes this whole lot's gonna be full of reporters and cameras. -You don't talk to the press. Got it? -Yes sir. Alright. Get on the horn. [scoffs] [mysterious music] Where am I heading? It's up the stairs and to the right. [whistles] Holy shit! Yeah... What the hell happened in here? Definitely didn't happen on accident. [low growling] What's up with that hole? No idea. It doesn't go anywhere, it's just a dead end. You guys done over here? Alright, I need everyone to clear the room, please. Let's go. [ominous music] Oh, shit... Jameson Biggs. You know this guy? Yeah. I did. Ooh. What the fuck is that? Reminds me of something I saw when I was in the Navy. Pulled this whole sinking boatload of refugees out of the ocean. But last I checked there weren't any great whites walking around the city. Yeah, I'm not sure if I follow you, Jack. What are you saying? What I'm saying, Sol, is if that's not a shark bite I don't know what the hell it is. [ominous music] [cell phone ringing] [cell phone keeps ringing] [ringing stops] [folksy music] [sizzling, chatter] Holy shit, dude. Check out that fine female specimen that just walked in, man! You know you say that shit every time, right? But I mean it this time. Like look! I'm pretty sure that's Henry Ward! MIGUEL: Shit, you know that guy? Yeah. He used to help my dad with the bar and he probably still does. CLARENCE: Ladies? What's the holdup? Oh, I see! She's out of your league, Miguel. Now get back to work. Huh? ... Yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I shall fear no evil. For thou art with me. Thy rod and thy staff shall comfort me. -[cough] -At this time... we'd like to welcome a very good friend of Jameson's, Mr. Henry Ward, up here to read the eulogy. Henry? [coughing] In good times and in bad, in moments of darkness and those of light, we are left with many questions. Death turns a new page for all of us. We all remember Jameson Biggs. Some with fond memories. Others, maybe not so much. Without a doubt, Jameson Biggs was a man of few words. A man angered by his... [ticking] HENRY: ... Demons. [ticking, water running] [TV news chatter] You're just a worthless drunk. Good for nothing piece of shit! At least I put my time in down at that bar. Why don't you go drink yourself into a coma? You know what? I've had enough of your bullshit. I'm gonna pack up Russell and I'm gonna take my shit... and I'm gonna leave your dumb drunk ass! Oh is that right? You think you're gonna take my goddamn son from this house? -Yeah, I'm gonna take MY son out of this house! -You're gonna take MY goddamn son out of this house? -Goddamn! -What you think you're gonna do? You fucking bitch! Stay down! JAMESON: I'm coming for you! You little shit! I'm gonna get you! [kids playing] [rock music] Son of a bitch, Russell. How many times have I told you you need to be more goddamn careful? [alien noises] Russell, go to the car. -Dad, we were just -Don't backtalk me, boy! Get to the goddamn car now! HENRY: He and I saw many deaths. We were lucky to make it through. But in his death, we must ask ourselves what it means to forgive. What it means to accept a path that most could never understand. [bar chatter] HENRY: Jameson. -Jameson! -What? You sent the kid to the car. Or did you forget? Nope. Didn't forget. Just needed a rest. Ah, save it, friend. How do you expect him to get home? You're not serious! I'm good. You're in no shape to drive. Know what, Henry? Mind your own fucking business! Anything happens to that kid, I'm gonna be stacking you in that cooler! Pick that shit up, Henry. What happened in there, Dad? You wouldn't understand. You're just an idiot kid. [ominous music] Russell, where the hell did you get that? It was in Grandpa's things. I just thought it was cool. -No no no. You get that the hell out of here now! -Hey! Why are you so crazy all the time? Russell, pretty soon you're gonna have to grow up. Realize there's nothing a man won't do for his family. Yeah, like get drunk all the time? I never wanted this... this burden. This curse. And pretty soon it's gonna be yours. Let's hope you got the balls to handle it, kid. Because I sure as hell do not. Get your seatbelt on. We're gonna get the hell out of here. [muttering] Hi Rusty. -This must be... -What? A lot? Well... Yes. Yeah, well, fuck off. What? What. What could you possibly have to say to me? It's been 15 years. Why now? -I'm so sorry, Rusty! -Save it. I don't accept. Dad's dead, you've got your perfect new family, and I'm stuck here with a shitload of fucked-up memories, a future going nowhere, but probably ending up right there next to him. And it's both your faults. So don't apologize. How can I help you? What can I do? Piss off. Go back to your second chance and leave me alone. [dramatic music] Ah, shit! [grooving music] Good morning. ... Oh. You wanna go get some breakfast? Um... You know what? Count me out on this one, but why don't you get yourself something nice? I'm not a fucking hooker, asshole! Hey! Look at that! God dammit, guy! How many times do I gotta tell you, the homeless shelter's literally two blocks from here? [dramatic music] [diner chatter] Well look who decided to show up! Queen bee mingling with the worker bees. Dude, I didn't think you were gonna show up. Yeah, sorry about that. Has Clarence shown up yet? Yeah, he's been in here since like 7. Old man likes to sling eggs and bacon like he loves it or some shit. Fuck! Dude, I've been covering your ass far too much, alright? You've been late for far too long, man. I can't keep doing this! -Don't steal my eggs, man! Don't steal my eggs! -Let me look like I'm working. Damn it, man! Rusty? Well, you little sack of rat shit! I'm getting tired of this. Third time this week! How am I supposed to run this place when I got cooks who can't show up on time? -Yeah. Sorry. I -[stammering] Why don't you keep your little prick at home like the rest of us and try to get a good night's sleep? Come on! We took care of it, man. Just lay off. Shut the fuck up. Miguel needs to get his ass back to the bacon. Comprendo? That's fucking cold, man. How can I do my job if I'm doing your job, Russell? Besides. Looking like a grease stain is bad for my image. That's why I pay you to do it. And last time I checked I pay you pretty fucking good too. So you just want to fire me or...? Yeah! Yeah, I wanna fire you. But unfortunately Marco out there likes his cholesterol a little too much, if you catch my drift. Just get here on time, okay? Or you're gonna find your ass in the fucking fryer. You feel me? -Gotcha. -Nyeah! And clean this mess up. Someone's gonna trip and break their fucking neck. Jesus fucking Christ! You ever wonder if it's worth it? What do you mean? Like this town. Or this job. We live to serve eggs on a platter for 9 hours a day. You ever wonder if this is worth it? No, bro. You're talking to a man who's got everything to lose. How do you mean? Well... When I came here I... It wasn't easy for me. Life isn't easy, Russ. That's just the way it is. This job... It ain't great. But it's a job. You feel me? Yeah... Yeah. Forget I said anything. That was stupid. Hey. Life is everything you make it. Some people need everything. All I need is a way to get by. All I need is a way to make cash so I can put food on the table, and I can pay the bills, and I can treat my ladies to a nice dinner. That's what I need, Russ. My old man, may he rest in peace, he used to tell me "Miguel, agradecido dios." Be grateful to God. -Didn't your old man teach you that? -No. -Good Lord works in mysterious ways, man. -Nah, fuck that guy. Who? Your old man or the Good Lord? ¿Porque no los dos? [praying in Spanish] You stupid fucking white trash motherfucker! You're gonna go to hell for that one. Seriously! You know what? Speaking of hell, I'm gonna go out for a smoke. You think you got this? Yeah, yeah, get the fuck out of my kitchen, man. [intense music] As I'm sure you're aware, your father didn't have much in the way of assets. Mostly debt, unfortunately. Figures. He did have one thing of value to his name: Roby's Bar. The bar. The hell am I supposed to do with the bar? LAWYER: Whatever you want. The property is paid for. You can sell it, rent it out, or keep it going. It's your call. Awesome... [rustic music] [lively chatter & rustic music] Russell Biggs. Pleasure, my boy. Hi, Henry. How's it going? I wish I could say circumstances were better. IMy condolences, Russell. I feel like it should be me offering you my condolences. He was your father, Russ. For better or for worse. You know, there's nothing anyone can say that would change everything that happened between you two. Yeah, no shit. Just don't let it consume you. I just wanted him to come around. You know? But he was always too busy with this place or beating Mom. You're a grown man now. You get to choose: How to feel. How to move forward. How to make the right choices at the right times. How to forgive him. What if I can't do that? Well... I'm afraid that sooner, rather than later, his demons are gonna surface and become your problem. Okay. You better stop drinking, old man. You're starting to scare me. Jesus, Dad. Are you gonna talk this guy to death or are you gonna let him have some fun? Russ, you remember Jessie. You were both pretty young at the time but you know what they say about young love. Oh my god, stop! It's nice to see you. And I'm sorry about your loss. Same. And, uh, thank you. Well we were just knocking some pool balls around. You care to join? Yeah! Why not? [strange rumbling] What the fuck was that? Nobody really knows. Happens from time to time. Place is full of mysteries! You mean to tell me nobody's ever gone upstairs to check it out? That doesn't sound like a mouse or a rat. That sounds like a fucking polar bear! Your dad never allowed anyone to go upstairs. Nobody except for my dad, who also never allowed anyone to go upstairs. So I guess we've all just kind of gotten used to it. It's probably haunted. So what's the plan? You're pretty much the boss, right? Yeah, I am. How do you know that? I'm pretty sure our dads talked about everything. All these years later? It's not just a trip down memory lane. You're trying to decide if the place is worth holding on to, right? Yeah. Maybe I am. Well, Russell Biggs, perhaps you ought to hold on to it for a little while. You might just start to like it here. Babe. I got stuff to do. Let's go. Hey Tony! I told you. You're not allowed in here. Fuck you, old man! None of your goddamn business. [simmering rock music] This what you've been doing? Other women? We were just playing pool, okay? Not anymore. I'm not gonna tell you again. You usually talk to women like that, party pants? She getting you wet? You like that? So how's Daddy doing, by the way? [aggressive rock music] JESSIE: Tony! JESSIE: Tony! Enough! This ain't over. Got that right, little bitch. Hey Tinkerbell. Think fast. Fucking go! [motorcycle revs up] [metal music] So uh. Who's the meathead? Felt like fucking Bigfoot. No, not Sasquatch. The other guy. Oh, that piece of shit. Tony Bishop. Lieutenant for the local M.C. We might be dead tomorrow. Eh, well, we'll see about that. What's Jessie see in all of that anyway? It's not like that. She's tried to leave him a couple times. You can imagine how that went. Hey. Thanks for having my back in there. Don't mention it. Everyone calls me Kip. Nice to meet you. Likewise. You know, no offense, your dad was kind of a nutjob. Yeah! None taken. He was a... Yeah. I've never seen anybody take on Tony one-on-one like that. I think he made a good choice leaving it in your hands. Just do me a favor though: It's a nice spot. Don't fuck it up. Gee, Kip. Thanks for the vote of confidence. Don't mention it. See you tomorrow? [ominous hum] [banging] What's wrong with you? I'm not ready for this. That's because you're weak! [intense music] My bar now. What the fuck were you up to? Crazy son of a bitch. DELIVERY DRIVER: I know what I promised, but I don't know what to tell you. I got a... It's game night with the boys, alright? I promised them I'd be there and if Kyle wins one more time... ... I'm never gonna live it down. Alright, I'm at my last delivery. Love you. Bye. Got your pizza, bro! [drum beat] Are you in here? Hello? Of course there's a fucking hundred stairs. [drum beat intensifies] DELIVERY DRIVER: Somebody order a pizza? [groans] Hello? This is some Ed Dean shit, dude. [banging] Huh! That would make some good macaroni art. Do you want this pizza? Dude? RUSSELL: Fucking shit! [terrified panting] Jesus fucking Christ! What the shit? Hey. You want this fucking pie or what? RUSSELL: Oh shit! Oh fuck! Run! Get out of here! What are you doing? Run, motherfucker! Go! Shit! [ethereal hissing] [terrified screaming] Oh fuck! [meaty bludgeoning sounds] [demonic howl] [sigh] Ah, shit. Looks like I wasn't wrong after all. Anything anyone has ever said about my dad was right. He was a loon. He was a fucking quack. I think being crazy might be an easier explanation. Than what? That everything your dad went through, and everything you're going through, was for real. No. No, what I just saw can't be real. Whatever. You ain't seen shit yet, kiddo. This is just the beginning. Have you seen that thing? No. No I haven't. But I've seen enough to know your old man was not crazy. We had ways of dealing with this... thing. After bar close tonight, meet me back here. I got something to show you. Might even answer a few questions. In the mean time, you go home and get some rest. You're gonna need it. Um... There's a dead pizza man upstairs. No. No there's not. Not anymore, anyway. [tires squealing] [water dripping] [bathtub filling] [pained groaning] [gasping, panting] -[knocking] -REYNOLDS: Yeah, come on in. -So what do we got? -Well, the autopsy results were inconclusive. Throat wound appears to be self-inflicted. But the bite... -Yeah, not a shark bite, huh? -Not even close. They say the DNA appears to be mostly human, but unless we're on the hunt for the Jolly Green fucking giant, I don't know what to tell you. What do they mean, "mostly" human? Look at this: The maximum jaw width of an average adult male is about 55 millimeters. REYNOLDS: And this bite wound on Jameson? 122 millimeters. Not to mention humans only have 4 cuspids. This motherfucker? He had 12. I don't get it. Doesn't make any sense. What about DNA? Inconclusive. I'm telling you, man. We are dealing with some fucked-up space alien bullshit here. Really starting to look that way. It doesn't appear he has much of a relationship with his kid or his ex-wife, but I'll establish contact. Maybe we'll learn something. [phone ringing] Go ahead, Linda. LINDA: Deputy Director Mullen for you. Yeah, go ahead and put him through. Uh, he's here, sir. He's here? Yes, sir. He's in Intero-1. Alright, Linda. We'll be right in. Wait wait wait. So you're telling me the big man's here? Better button up. This can't be good. Take a seat. What brings you to town, Hank? Jack, do you mind telling me why I had to leave my wife and hop on a red-eye and fly 1,000 miles to this frozen asshole of a town because my best guy can't handle the press or return my fucking phone calls? Hank, it's a small community. The local yokels got here first. You know how they like to talk. There's no reason to assume that it's going to affect the case. Quiet towns need quiet headlines. You know why that is, Jack? Because quiet headlines prevent panic. You've got the entire county up your ass and I'm here to pull it out. I appreciate your concern. We'll sort it out. We just got the autopsy report today. We have plenty of time. This your new guy? Yeah. Agent Sol Jermaine. Pleasure to meet you, sir. Mine as well. So where are we at, gentlemen? We're following up our leads. Nothing solid yet. Well, actually... I think I have something. Well? What is it? I pulled up all the missing persons reports in the area and it's a fucking laundry list. Every last case, cold as shit. But they have one thing in common: They all could be trailed or linked back to the bar. Jesus, Jack. Well at least your training's on point. -Good work, Junior. -Thank you, sir. Don't get cocky. Yes sir. You gentlemen have work to do. Follow the leads and make them stick. And if this guy Russell has anything to do with the... ... magical disappearing bodies... I want him in a 4 by 10 cell. Jack, you know where to find me. Yes sir. [intense synth music] RUSSELL: Henry, what are we doing in a funeral home? I'm coming to that. But first I have to help you understand just what the hell you're up against. Okay... Yeah, okay. Explain away. Well... Your father trusted me. He told me everything he could. I think in his heart he knew that eventually this thing was going to come after you. Why? What does this creature want with me? Not a creature. A demon. [ethereal growl] Demon? HENRY: Tied to your family by a curse. Your father and I found a lot of papers and journals from your grandfather that talked about a curse that started with him. Okay. Why him? What did he do? Well, your grandfather was successful but not by his own effort. He took advantage of a lot of poor and middle-class people. He hurt a lot of families to get what he wanted. He ran across a shaman that told him the curse had started with one of these families. Okay. Let's say I believe any of this voodoo shit. I never met the man! I know you didn't. But just like you and your father, he and his father were not close. Got even worse as he grew up. Okay. So a family curses him with a demon. Why didn't it just kill him and get on with it? That's not how the curse works. That would be the easy way out. Then how does it work if it's not trying to kill you? It kills the people you care about. Unless it's fed. What, like a dog? [demonic growling] They call it "Comedenti." That's Latin for "The Eater." And you saw what kind of appetite it has. ... And it has to eat people. And lots of them. And fed only by you. How do you know? I mean, how do we know that this thing is passed on to me? Because if it hadn't, you'd be dead right now. And you saw it with your own eyes. Other people can't see it, that's right. Unless they're cursed. Or about to be eaten. Oh fuck! This is nuts... No argument from me there. But it's your duty now. You have to keep that thing fed. If not, the consequences will be unavoidable. People you care about will suffer. You'll lose everything, just like your grandfather did. And your own father. For how long? Until you find a way to kill it. Something your grandfather and your father couldn't do. What happened to my grandfather? Nobody knows for sure. It's clear from his writing that he spent a lot of time trying to figure out a way to kill it. Looks like he had a promising lead but then... nothing! Disappeared! Or got eaten. Your fa Eh... Come on. -What? -Come on. No. No, what? What were you going to say? Well, your father thought perhaps if... if he took his own life... that would end the curse. Obviously, it did not. So the demon remains. Upstairs there for whatever reason. I don't know. Maybe that's where the curse started. Okay... So what are we doing here? Aside from getting a jump start on putting me in one of these boxes? Well, that might be where I can help. This funeral home's been in our family for years. Okay... How's a funeral home supposed to help me? It's full of bodies? Bodies that are already dead so there's no need for pointless killing? You're either high or a genius. I can't tell. Worked for your father. After the wake was done, the casket closed, family was none the wiser. This is seriously messed up. I never said it was noble. But it's either that or the alternative. Yeah. Okay. How often does this need to go down? The demon needs to be fed at least every 3 days. At least. That leaves you... uh... 48 hours. And you don't want to be late. Oh and another thing: This has to be kept between us. Well no shit!

That's bullshit. You don't deserve to be treated the way you're treated. And nobody hits a woman and gets away with it. What? You don't think a woman can take care of herself? That's not what I'm saying. It's got nothing to do with the woman. If a man hits a woman, he's not a man. Look. I see a strong independent woman who is... Welcoming... Funny... ... and truly beautiful. And all that's wasted on a piece of shit named Tony. You're sweet, Russell Biggs. But seriously. Don't you wish he would just go away? Don't you wish he would just... slide out of your life? Of course I do. Okay? But Tony is fucking Tony and he's not going anywhere. Not with his club. Not with his status in this town. [sigh] It's nice to know that someone cares though. I'm not afraid of Tony... What's his name? Bishop. Bishop. I'm not afraid of Tony Bishop. Maybe you should be. [bar chatter from inside] [sigh] Hey, Henry. Can you make sure that Jessie isn't with Tony tonight? The hell are you thinking, kid? You're not thinking what I think you're thinking, are you? Fuck yeah! Russell, that's dangerous! You know, you may not be doing the dirty work but that doesn't mean you're not at fault. All those skeletons are gonna lead right back to you. Yeah. Yeah. Just make sure she's somewhere else, okay? [coughs] -Bro, you got a light? -Yeah. Thank you. -Hey! -I said thank you. TONY: The fuck? RUSSELL: Hey. Tough guy. I'm taking what's yours. You got a problem with that, why don't you grow a pair and meet me at my bar? 3AM. The new guy. Oh, princess! You done fucked up. You done fucked up! [motorcycle revs] [rock music] [highway sounds] Princess! Heh-ha! Daddy's home! Where are ya, little bitch? RUSSELL: Hey! Douchebag! Up here. Wanna come down and make me a drink? Maybe I've had enough? Not enough? I don't know. [unintelligible] [cackles] That'll do. Ready or not, here I come! Ope! Someone forgot to do the dishes. [glass shatters] Dishes are done! You gotta be fucking kidding me. You can't just come down here? Jesus fuck... [coughing] Goddamn that's a lot of stairs! [ominous music] Princess! TONY: Where the fuck are you? I love what you've done with the place. Art fucking sucks, though. Hey! There he is. I hear you've been spooning with Tinkerbell. I'm sick of taking your shit, Tony. I'm not gonna do it anymore. Actually... You kind of are. [grunts] You're taking it right now! [grunts, groans] I just got back from the bar! Only had 2. We only ever have 2. We don't do one thing in this town: You just don't! Mess! With the Bishop! Fucking little piece of shit! Inbred little son of a bitch. Are you feeling good, huh? I'm feeling good. Let's see what you got. [grunts, groans] Oh shit! Woo! Let's do that again! Now... -Oh, shit! This is just too much fun. -[Russell groans] Fucking hell! My balls, man! [demonic rattling] You little fuck! If you wanna play that way... ... we can play that way. [hissing] [rising strings] What the fuck! Oh shit! What the fuck is that? Fuck! [terrified babbling] [retching groan] [demonic roar] [painful gibberish] [triumphant demonic roar] [sink running] Jesus... [truck engine revving] You must be Russell Biggs. I'm Agent Reynolds. You can call me Jack. Alright, Jack. It's a bit late for a nightcap, don't you think? Oh, no. I'm not here for anything like that. I gave it up years ago. Kind of hit rock bottom, if you know what I mean. Well, uh... Well, what can I do for you? Well, I'm just curious, see. Been keeping a close eye on a gentleman by the name of Tony Bishop. Maybe you've had the pleasure? You know, I can't be certain. I am fairly new around here. Taking over for the old man, you know? I used to know your dad back in the day. I'm sorry for your loss. Yeah. Um. You're not here to talk about my dad, though, are you? I'm not. See, what's strange to me, Russell, is that we trailed Mr. Bishop to this area. And I can tell you with absolute certainty that this right here is his bike. That's odd, right? Sure. Strange. Although he is known to frequent this bar from time to time, isn't he? I thought you said you couldn't be certain. No. I can't be certain. But Henry's daughter does date the man and has made mention of him a couple of times. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if that's where he was right now. She was here not too long ago. Alright. We'll see you around, Russell. See you, Jack. [tap on window] Jesus Christ, guy. What, are you stalking me now? Yeah. No. I'm good on that, thanks. Yeah. Alright. Fine. Give me a minute. Yeah. Fuck... Alright. What do you want? What? What's... What is... -Oh, you want me to follow you? -[grunt] Yeah. Okay. Obviously. Of course. It's only the middle of the night. Why not? Uh, so hey. Where are you taking me? Seriously, guy. You gotta tell me what's going on here because I'm not playing anymore. What? Jesus fucking Christ! You're crazy! And I'm an idiot for following Mr. Crazy into murder alley! Just show me what you're gonna show me. [grunt] Yeah. You killed a rat. Congratulations. What? Yeah! Yeah. It's bloody because there's blood in rats. Yeah. What? Ugh... Oh man. That's sanitary. Yes! It's more of that blood we were just talking about. RUSSELL: What? What do you want? Smacking the ground and... "To..." Oh. We're doing this. Okay. Yeah. Sure. "To..." "To kill." "To kill" a rat? To kill a rat you throw a knife at it? What's the story here? You know what? Fuck this. Fuck you! I'll see you at my house later. Right? [sad music] REYNOLDS: I know. I just... I got a bad feeling about this one. This time I really mean it. Just, uh... Tell them I love them. Give them a kiss, huh? Tell them I'm sorry. I love you too. [tapping fingers] Ah, shit. You're making that face again. -What do you mean? -Come on. Don't bullshit me. You know exactly what face I'm talking about. How does Liz feel about this? She doesn't strike me as a woman who likes to share. I don't know how you do it. I mean, I'm sure you miss an awful lot of pancakes with your kid. Sol, you're good at your job. But you don't do this job as long as I have without missing a few pancake breakfasts. At the end of the day, the hope is if you do your job and do it right... ... there's some other kid that doesn't have to miss a pancake breakfast with their mom and dad. Hell yeah. Hell yeah. Alright. Stakeout tonight. Don't forget to pack a sandwich. Aw, come on. You and your fucking sandwiches, man! Jesus! -REYNOLDS: Where are you spending your money? -JERMAINE: Fast food! [upbeat rock music] -Hey guys! How you doing? -Good! Thank you. So I'll give you a little time with your menus here and I'll come back and take your order. -Awesome. Thank you! -Okay. Well if it ain't my long-lost too-good-to-cook never-here-half-the-time buddy Russ and this lovely angel whose company he surely doesn't deserve. You're too sweet! Hey Miguel. How are things? Is Clarence losing any more hair? Oh, that motherfucker's got hair growing up his ass always. -Forgive me, beautiful. -You're fine. Nah, we're good, man! We miss you but... Happy for you all the same. Thanks. I appreciate that. Well. I ain't shit for waiting, so can I get you two anything? Uh, an iced tea would be amazing, thank you. I'll just do a Coke. An iced tea for the lovely lady, and a rum and coke for the drunk! Coming right up. Why? Why are we friends? [laughing] You look good, Jessie. Haven't even gotten our drinks yet and you're already hitting on me! Rusty doesn't waste much time, does he? No, I don't suppose I do. You're sweet. Look... I know you might think that I might be broken or something but I'm not. Okay? I... I didn't mean to assume anything... But your boyfriend did crack a pool cue up the side of my face? I'm sorry about that. Um... Our relationship... It was complicated. "Was"? Yeah. I don't think that Tony will be coming around anymore. Why is that? Some agent came looking for him. Which can only mean one thing: That he's wanted for something. Which is not surprising. No shit? Huh... What? Is there something you're not telling me? No! A guy did stop by the bar the other night and was looking for Tony... I told him that he might be with you. Oh. Uh... Well Tony's a ghost now. I just hope he stays that way. I have a feeling he will. Besides! Nobody needs that energy. -Or competition, right? -[scoffs] "Competition." Pah! It's only the Biggs, baby! [ominous music] REYNOLDS: Well well well. Where have you been, Henry? We just need one reason. One reason to go in there and bust this guy. Maybe they're just running low? Maybe. Maybe not. Something doesn't smell right here. Probably all your fucking sandwiches. -Woah! What? -So disrespectful! I'm not judging you. Just giving you the facts, man. -"Facts." -They fucking stink! [grunting] -Big problem, Russ! -What's that? Fucking agents are staking the place out. I told you this was risky! Now they got eyes on us. Relax! They don't have shit. Wrong! We don't know what the hell they got. I told you: Mess around like this, all those skeletons are gonna lead right back to you. Say they got a search warrant! How are you gonna explain all these dead bodies in your freezer? Alright! Alright. Shit! Let me think. -Get the bodies out? -Are you serious? I'm sure they saw only me. If they're sitting outside, they're too damn close. It's the only way. How am I supposed to feed that thing without any bodies, Henry? We'll figure it out. But ain't nothing getting fed if we're sitting in prison. Now get going! "Now get going." You're not lifting the bodies. I say we just go in there. How are we gonna do that? We don't have enough yet. The fuck we don't! The data speaks for itself. We have the missing persons. Tony last week. And to add on top of that: the fucking pizza guy! -There's a pizza guy? -Yes there's a fucking pizza guy. And guess where his last delivery was. -The bar. -That's right. The bar. We got these motherfuckers. All we gotta do is go in there and bust 'em. That's it. Welp. There's nothing to stop us from talking to him. We should see what he has to say for himself. -Let's go. -Fucking A, right? Why don't you go around back and check it out, just in case? -Alright. -Be careful. -Hey Jack. -Hey Henry. -How you doing? -I'm good. I'm good. Hey, sorry about the nature of our conversation last time I was here. It was, uh... Don't worry about it. It's all good. Need a hand with that beer? Yeah. Yeah, that would be nice. Thank you. You just show me where you want me to set it down. Oh, just stick it around the corner there. I'll stack it in the cooler later. Fuck! So! Rumor has it you're looking to retire. Any truth to that, Jack? Oh, you know. We all gotta hang up the hat sometime. We're not all gonna live forever like you, Henry. I'm training in some new blood though. He's got a good sense of things. I think he's gonna work out just fine. Ah, speak of the devil! I'm almost afraid to ask this, but surely a late-night cold one isn't the only thing you're after, I would assume? You're right, Henry. We just never really had a chance to touch base with Russell after the unfortunate circumstances with his father. Just had a couple questions we wanted to ask him. At 3 o'clock in the fucking morning? Come on, Jack. You don't gotta bullshit the bullshitter. You're right, Henry. I apologize. Actually we need to ask him quite a few questions about quite a few unfortunate circumstances. -Think you could help me out? -Next time I see him, I'll send him your way. Probably tomorrow. Alright. Sounds like a plan. You do that, Henry. See you around. Come on. See you, old-timer. Yeah. Have a good night, gentlemen. Are you alright? You seem a bit off today. Yeah, I'm good. I haven't slept well the last couple nights, is all. Well what's wrong? You can talk to me, you know. I had some plans for the bar. Stability stuff. Fell through. Mm. Perks of being a small business owner. It's alright, everything will work out the way it's supposed to. That's what I'm worried about. You're just full of mystery, aren't you, Russell Biggs? You know what? Let's forget about this. Because I'm fine. And you are fine. Beautiful, even. [cell phone ringing] [cell phone stops] You can't just dodge her forever, you know. She's your mother, even if she doesn't deserve to be. It's just easier to pretend she doesn't exist. -Her or her perfect new family. -Hey, do you remember what you told me? You told me that you want to replace the bad memories with good ones. Jameson had some pretty bad effects on you. Maybe you two have more in common than you realize. -No. No, I was a child and she should have protected me. -I'm not making any excuses for her, okay? Maybe she's come to terms with it. I don't know. Quit being a sad little bitch and answer the phone. Okay. Next time. Maybe you just need a night off from all your worries. Now that is the best idea I've heard in a while. [calm guitar music] Erin! Have you heard anything of Russell lately? I haven't seen him since a few days ago. I think he's with Jessie. Sorry, Henry. Three days, Russ! Three fucking days! Where the hell are you? [giggling] [panting] [laughing together] Goddammit, Russ! I don't know where you are or what you're doing but that thing needs to get fed or all hell's going to break loose! -How'd the test go? -It went fine, I guess. Like, I normally get A+s and I just got an A- this time. Girl, I can barely get Cs, let alone get an A! -Do you study? -I do the best I can! -Well that's not my problem. I just do my math. -Whatever. Everyone's favorite! Broccoli! [thud] -That's weird! -Mom? What's going on? -[demonic whispering] -What's going on? -Candles? -Candles. I think we have some candles. That sounds like fun. I think they are over... here. [screaming] -[screaming] -[slashing] [panting] [panting] [giggling] [sobbing] RUSSELL: You've reached Russell's voicemail. Go ahead and leave a voice message for me to listen to never. If I want to talk to you, I'll call you. No! No! No no no no! [sobbing] Hmm. Not a bad first time, right? -Mmm. Didn't hate it. -[snorting laughter] "Didn't hate it." -Hmm. -What? Well, Henry called and so did my mom, but she left a voicemail which is weird. Listen to it. What the fuck? What? What's wrong? [ON PHONE: sobbing] What the fuck is that, Russell? -It's It's my mom. I gotta go. -Russell, what the fuck is going on? I can't explain right now but whatever you do, whatever happens, do not leave this place. Okay? Do not leave this apartment. Alright? Okay. I gotta go. This is Jack. I'm trailing Russell Biggs right now. He took off in a big hurry and I think he's up to something. When you get this, I need you to head to the bar right away. I think tonight can be our night. [otherworldly creaking] [demonic howling] [demonic roar upstairs] [demonic roar upstairs] Mom? Mom! Oh shit... Mom? Mom! Mom? Mom, where are you? Shit! Mom! No no, Mom! Mom... Fuck! Fuck! Goddammit... Russell Biggs, you're under arrest. You're out of your depth, Jack. I just got here, you know I couldn't have done this. Why would I kill my own mother? I don't know what the hell happened here. But I'm gonna bring you in and I'm gonna find out. Put your hands on the back of your head. Do it! Are you here? I heard something on Russell's phone and I don't know what to do. Dad? What's up, Reynolds? Sol, I got him. I got Russell Biggs. I followed him to his mother's house. Multiple homicides. The entire family. It's a total massacre. Oh shit. REYNOLDS: I'm bringing him in. Alright. Well I'm gonna head down to the bar to see if the old man has anything to say about this. Dad? [high-pitched whistle] -Hey. -God! Who the hell are you? Uh, Jessie. Who the hell are you? I'm Jermaine. I'm looking for a man named Henry. Is he here? I don't know. Henry is my father. I came here looking for him. I think that something terrible might have ha [low rumbling] You're making a huge mistake here, Jack. Here's the thing, Russ. I don't think I am. The missing people around that bar. Tony Bishop and his bike. And now your mother? And those kids? Not to mention your history with your father, and what's the one thing they all have in common, Russ? You. You don't understand. No I don't. But I'd like to. Well I can't fucking explain this. You better start trying to explain it, Russ. Or you and I are going to be here for a very long time. -Russell Biggs. -This is Deputy Director Hank Mullen. Deputy Director? Jesus Christ. Jig's up, kid. It's time to talk. You and your family have been a thorn in the side of this bureau for a very long time. I don't know what the fuck you're talking about, Hank. -[grunting] -Hank! You listen to me, boy: I'm done with your ghost stories and boogeyman stories. Your grandfather was a killer, you are a killer, and so was your dad. Where is this coming from, Hank? You don't know shit about me, buddy. Oh, that's where you're wrong. I know a lot about you. [sigh] A word outside, Hank. Please. I don't know how you do it, what you do with the evidence, but I'm gonna find out. And when I do, I'm gonna stick you in the deepest, darkest hole you've ever seen. -A word, Hank! -Hey! Sure. -Piece of shit! -Come on, Hank. -Hey. Take your fucking hands off me. -Let's go. The hell was that, Hank? This kid knows more than he lets on. That may be, but apparently he's not the only one. Why don't you tell me what do you know? This case goes back a long ways. It's a family of killers in there. The only probable motive is Tony Bishop. I'll give you that. The rest... I'm not certain. What's to be uncertain about? All the signs point to Biggs. What more do you need? Blood to fall from the ceiling? I want that confession! I followed him to his mother's house. I was less than a minute behind him. There's no way he could have done what I saw in that house. But I'm only gonna get to the bottom of it if you let me do it my way. I got some rapport with the kid. So let me do my thing. He's been gone a long time. When I started, he was the focus. I know he's still involved. Yeah... [echoing clang] -Stay behind me. -Okay. Sorry. Do you know what all these weird paintings are? No, but I'm sure your father does. Oh God, I hope he's okay. -Oh man, I got a bad feeling... -[whispering] Okay. Shh. Oh no! Oh no no no no! [scream] -What the fuck! -[sobbing] HENRY: My dearest Jessie. Wherever you go in life, whatever you do, I know you won't be the same. [sobbing] You have been my shining star for all these years. Jessie... My love... My life... You have been the best part of my life. When your mom left I didn't think I would make it but... Dad, that's very sweet, but why are you writing it on a bar napkin? You can laugh if you want, but I proposed to your mother on a bar napkin. No way. Way! Everybody thought it was corny. Even she did! But you know she kept that napkin for years and years and years. It was kind of a thing between us, you know? Now it can be a thing between us. Love, Dad. P.S., I'm glad I wasn't wrong about young sweethearts. -[sobbing] -Hey hey hey! We gotta get the fuck out of here. Come on! Let's go, come on. We have to go. What is that? What is that! -JESSIE: Oh no, we've gotta do something! -JERMAINE: Get out of here! Freeze! [demonic howl] Freeze, motherfucker! Fuck you, Halloween! [otherworldly growl] [pained scream] [intense synth music] [ethereal whispering] Every minute I waste explaining this to you is another person potentially dying. We have to get to that bar! Yeah, because the demon and your curse from your father, yadda yadda yadda, I get it! -Yeah, well it's the fucking truth! -I get it! Look, I didn't believe any of it either but Jameson's dead and he left me with this fucking thing. Who else knows about this old story of yours? Henry. But I forced him to help me. I knew I couldn't do this by myself. I sent my partner over to the bar to talk to Henry tonight. Well call him! Call your partner right now. [dreadful music] Sol, it's Jack. Do not go to the bar. Call me back. It's urgent. Son of a bitch. There's some big shit going down right now, Jack, and we're sitting here with our thumbs up our asses. How do I know that this isn't some sort of trap? How do I know that Henry isn't just your accomplice and that my partner's already dead? I don't know what to tell you to convince you. Keep me cuffed, maybe. Or do whatever you need to do. But if we do not go to that bar, more people will die. I can fucking promise you that. Take a chance, Jack! Alright. Let's go. Sol! Sol, where are you? Henry! Henry, answer me! What the fuck? Jessie! Don't fucking touch her. Where the hell have you been? You know this crazy fuck? Simon. What did you say? Simon Biggs. What happened to you? This is your grandfather. What's up with this tapping? It's Morse Code. Here. "Sorry." "Had to stay away." "Jessie's in shock." Agent Jermaine. Sol. Goddammit! Henry. What about Henry? So what do we do? No, here! "Demon trapped." "Animal blood." "They have to " Yeah! "To kill," to kill! That's what you were trying to tell me before? Fucking told you, Jack! Alright, I got it. Now what? I don't know. I need to find some way to kill this thing. -No, no, I can't let you This is my curse. -No! No! [grunting] Okay. Me. [ethereal whispers] [shattering] [intense orchestral music] [demonic roar] [hissing] Time to die! [hissing] [demonic roar] Shit! I gotta find some animal blood and help him. You're not just gonna find animal blood lying around, Russell. No no, I've seen it. He was using it to... Got it! -Alright. Let's go. -No. You stay here. That's gonna be fucking useless against that thing. Watch Jessie? Get her out of here? Simon! -Simon, where are you? -[ethereal groaning] Simon! Get off him, you weird bitch! -[anamilistic growling] -[Russell grunts] Hey! [pained howling] Don't bite the hand that feeds, bitch! [pensive music] Is it dead? About as dead as it's gonna be. You and I got a shitload of paperwork and red tape in our future. But she's gonna be okay. So you do believe me? I don't know what I believe. But whatever it is, I hope it's over. -Sure you don't wanna stick around for a drink? -No! I'm going home. I feel like pancakes. See you, Russ. See ya, Jack. Unis will be here soon. However it played out, you know he's not through with this, right? No. I know. But he's gonna cooperate. Simon's dead. So is Agent Jermaine. Had I known what you knew, I might have been able to prevent that. I... I'm sorry I didn't trust you, Jack. Trust never did come easy for you, did it? No... Part of the job, right? So what's next? Give my regards to Washington. I'm done, Hank. Finished. Jack. You're one of the good ones. Take a vacation. You think about it.
